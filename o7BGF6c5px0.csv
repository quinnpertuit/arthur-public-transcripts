"84540","86200"," Oh, yeah, people coming in."
"86720","87580"," Here we go."
"91610","92970"," Turn that down. "
"96390","97750"," Turn that up."
"98330","99370"," Switch it over."
"103780","105160"," See what we got going on here. "
"105380","105780"," It's a little loud."
"107500","109040"," Turn that down a little bit."
"110980","120120"," Good morning, Joey Troy, Binky, Scott, not a suit, Lawrence, D-O-X, Ben Godfrey, James, M-A, Winky. "
"120400","120860"," Good morning, brother."
"121160","121660"," How are you?"
"121840","129900"," B-D, Matthias, Dragon Wolf, Petey Carboner, Jeremy Williams, Justin Kinney, Clapton, Crummy."
"130360","131340"," I love that name. "
"131940","133140"," I like that name."
"134140","137100"," Crummy, Marcus, A-K, Binky."
"137100","138000"," Good to see you, my brother. "
"138340","138740"," Yeah, dude."
"138960","141700"," Bullard, Tilt, T-L-T, Cap, time to long question, Mark."
"142060","142900"," Great question. "
"143480","144000"," You're a rumor."
"144220","144440"," Good morning."
"144540","146300"," We'll take a look at T-L-T this morning, too, actually. "
"147200","152160"," I've got it on my list of shit to be checking this morning."
"152720","155760"," There's an interesting note, too, from Spot Gamma this morning."
"156280","159840"," We'll try to decipher what they're saying this morning. "
"161580","164880"," We're rolling over slightly, heading into the 9.30 hour."
"164960","167220"," I'm trying to get on here as quickly as I possibly can, due to that."
"169300","170440"," We'll get some stuff here. "
"170880","175280"," We'll briefly go over what Bullard said yesterday, and then I think I saw Jenny Marcus this morning"
"175280","182020"," talk about how we have more fed speakers coming out, right to add some volatility to the market."
"183400","185180"," That was a good point that he made this morning."
"186240","188140"," We'll get right into it right now. "
"189400","194640"," This is an article from Bullard yesterday saying a 75 basis point hike could be an option if"
"194640","194900"," needed."
"195340","196500"," He talks about 1994."
"197280","204140"," We've talked, actually, we've referenced on this channel 1994 as being an important year to look"
"204140","204380"," at. "
"204860","207680"," I think it was 98 as well or 97."
"207960","210480"," We can take a look at those later on today if things slow down at all today."
"211140","215060"," We'll look at both those years, and they kind of look like what we've been going through this year,"
"215240","215460"," earlier. "
"216760","222840"," In all honesty, he wasn't as bearish as it may have been implied yesterday."
"223040","227140"," I know that the market was selling off while he was talking yesterday, but it really wasn't that"
"227140","227780"," bearish."
"228180","236820"," If you're able to read this article on your own on Bloomberg, what they're trying to do is"
"236820","238520"," manipulate the market. "
"238680","239080"," We know that."
"239160","241960"," We know that they're trying to manipulate the market without causing a recession."
"242840","243640"," That's going to be the attempt. "
"243900","245980"," They have attempted this in previous years."
"246780","252040"," We could have a down market for two, three quarters, and then we actually have a pretty decent bull"
"252040","253720"," run in the market."
"253860","256260"," What they're trying to do is not trigger a recession. "
"257160","261760"," Of course, you've got two different sides to this argument that we're going to have to trigger a"
"261760","264400"," recession or can the Fed even do this."
"265560","270420"," Though he was very bearish yesterday, he wasn't that bearish."
"270900","276540"," It leads into what Spock Emma is saying this morning about pricing risk into the market. "
"277020","283180"," Then, of course, just where the market is, just about a market breadth and normal capitulation in"
"283180","284880"," the market, where price really doesn't matter."
"285000","286300"," We'll talk about that this morning as well."
"287160","291600"," If you have a chance to go through that Bloomberg article, this is from yesterday at some point. "
"292240","296320"," When he's talking about how we need to go up to 75 points and we need to raise, we'll hit"
"296320","301360"," the 50 and then hit 25 points repetitively over the course of the year."
"302480","303780"," This isn't as bearish."
"305220","313760"," To me, this looks, and another thing too, is this morning I was reading about Black terms, these"
"313760","321380"," large, large investment banks that control market share and just the breadth, like the deepness of"
"321380","326520"," how much market share they control and how much they can control where the market goes. "
"326520","330680"," Now, of course, there's a counter argument to that that they can sell this market off and you get"
"330680","333360"," fucked in the process, whereas they don't."
"333760","337240"," But at the same time, you can see that the market is selling off."
"338260","339500"," It has been manufactured. "
"340100","341660"," We know that it's been manufactured to an extent."
"342140","345440"," First, they hit speculative growth, meme stock, stuff like that."
"346400","352820"," Then they started to hit the indexes and the ones that are left out would be what Apple, the"
"352820","358160"," Apple's out there in Teslas that have been the last of the big tech stocks holding the entire"
"358160","358860"," market up. "
"359760","368460"," It's interesting too, because BlackRock owns all of these, not only they own, but they basically"
"368460","375900"," were given the keys to the kingdom on corporate debt, i.e. QE, with these companies."
"377140","378080"," They own it."
"378480","381460"," They sold it and they can sell it down whenever they like. "
"382620","391920"," Even this bullish bullish bullish speech yesterday, to an extent, excuse me, this bullish speech"
"391920","395360"," yesterday, to an extent shows that everybody's in bed with each other."
"396440","405140"," From the people that create the ATFs, the people that sell 401k packages to pension funds right to"
"405140","406240"," the banks that are running it all."
"406540","410060"," There's only a few of them out there that are actually doing this and how the Fed has basically"
"410060","411260"," bought two to some extent. "
"412600","422220"," The Fed is to an extent trying to push off a recession to help with inflation"
"422220","425260"," and to not destroy the market."
"426100","431600"," They're going to attempt to massage this market over the course of a year and see if we can get"
"431600","433160"," one more ripper out of this market."
"433460","435080"," Whether that happens or not, I don't know. "
"435580","436980"," I don't really care to be honest."
"438000","443220"," I could care less if the market sold out tomorrow or goes high from here."
"443620","449580"," To me, this is one of the easiest markets to trade right now that I've experienced in some time. "
"450340","451680"," I just want to put that on out there."
"451800","453600"," There is one neat thing though, this morning."
"454080","455940"," This article came out yesterday from CNN Business. "
"456640","463940"," A lot of people scoff and laugh at these articles on CNN Business, but I don't."
"464100","470140"," When I look at articles from Bloomberg or articles, not really Bloomberg, like Market Watch and"
"470140","474280"," places like that, those are geared towards active investors, active traders."
"475240","478680"," Usually, these stories that are put out on CNNs of the world. "
"479480","481380"," They're geared towards a passive investor."
"482740","484480"," I thought this was an interesting one from yesterday."
"485400","486120"," You should take a look at it. "
"486200","487300"," It's some time this morning."
"488020","494960"," It just talks about the Shanghai shutting down and that this could be a story that becomes"
"494960","496140"," important down the road."
"496300","499700"," We know right now that the market risks are with Ukraine. "
"500800","505440"," We also know that the other big story is the risk from rates."
"506320","510820"," But that polling statement yesterday and when we get into the Spock AM report, you want to keep"
"510820","516820"," this in the background of your thought process, this story that's developing about the shortages"
"516820","517539"," from China."
"518000","523240"," I don't know if it's in response to the Ukraine war and they're doing this in hands with Russia to"
"523240","526180"," try to fuck with our economy back door, fuck with our economy or not. "
"526300","526680"," I don't care."
"527320","534040"," But we know that there is going to be shortages to impact Tesla, of course, and production from"
"534040","535540"," their Shanghai plants."
"536280","542920"," But you should read through this article and keep this on your horizon for other news for why the"
"542920","545860"," market's going to go down, why news is used to drop markets. "
"547340","554520"," And the Spock AM is talking about Fed rates and already being priced in, risk from Fed rates being"
"554520","555060"," priced in."
"555200","560560"," And then also the Ukraine war somewhat priced into the market, the risk price in the market."
"560840","566300"," And this seems to be a story that's going to be shovel and spoon fed to two passive investors over"
"566300","569080"," the coming weeks and month where you'll start this here. "
"569100","573880"," Why is the market selling off if we've already priced in rate rates and we've already priced in"
"573880","574180"," Ukraine?"
"575280","580520"," This seems like the next big one that you're going to start to see more information roll rollout"
"580520","580680"," about."
"580860","584980"," We've seen you've heard small, small paintings about this, small news about it, but they're going"
"584980","586320"," to shovel feed this to someone."
"586840","588200"," That's a that's a passive investor. "
"588580","593640"," I read these stories because I'm looking for the insight to what they're shoveling and or spoon"
"593640","595100"," feeding to the passive investor."
"595100","600100"," The guy that has a job, guy that has a 401k and he has water cooler talk with his friends,"
"600100","604920"," not from watching CNBC, but just by checking a simple news source like CNN."
"606620","611840"," This morning, building permits and housing starts for pretty much in line today, not not too much"
"611840","612380"," out of line. "
"612800","617400"," We do have some volatility later in the afternoon, around 12 p.m. We've got Charles Evans, we"
"617400","618100"," believe this is today, right?"
"618660","624380"," And then we've got the Fed, our Fed, our Fed President, Minneapolis Small Fed President, Neil"
"624380","630860"," Kashkari at 8 p.m. And then again, on Wednesday, we have a rack of speakers, right?"
"631020","634320"," I think this was what, what today Marcus was talking about this morning."
"634640","638840"," We got Mary Daily, we got Charles Evans, we got Ralph Raphael, both stick of the way, we've got the"
"638840","643680"," Bay's book at 2 p.m. So this all kind of lines up to add some volatility in the market"
"643680","644820"," as we head through today."
"646540","651900"," Also of note today would be, of course, everyone wants to know about earnings season, right?"
"652020","656960"," We've got Netflix, we've got IBM after the close today, we've got some big heavy hitters coming up"
"656960","657080"," right?"
"657220","658740"," We've got Tesla on Wednesday after the close. "
"660300","664680"," Further down the line, we have some unusual options on ATQ right now as well."
"665460","668800"," We've got American Airlines, some heavy hitters, and then over the next couple of weeks, we've got"
"668800","669720"," some heavy hitters coming out."
"670240","675520"," So that does play into the last part of, do they hold this market up for some of the heavy"
"675520","678340"," hitters come through, and then they dump it down the road?"
"678880","682480"," And maybe I think people have been asking that question is, you know, if the market's not going to"
"682480","686620"," go down, they just trade sideways until the heavy hitters out of the way, and then they let the"
"686620","687740"," market go at that point. "
"688780","694380"," It's interesting too, because this earnings season doesn't seem like it has much fluff as it has"
"694380","700640"," had in previous earnings seasons, and it was interesting to hear Johnson and Johnson and Lockheed"
"700640","706920"," Martin as well this morning tempering some of their future forecasts for their earnings and for the"
"706920","709220"," market in general."
"709800","712960"," It did listen to some of those reports this morning."
"713720","719560"," So it is setting up for a muted earnings season, even if we get great earnings from some of these"
"719560","723220"," companies, it's already starting to set up where it's muted. "
"723220","725660"," It's not really bad, but it's not great either."
"726080","728800"," So keep that note as we move along in the market."
"729460","733100"," One last check on the market breadth indicator we've been following. "
"733400","734640"," Yeah, I've got this one set to ES."
"735440","739780"," And I've been checking the 50 day as well to see where we are at today."
"739940","741140"," We're underneath the 50 day right now. "
"742100","745820"," And I'm going to expect that, you know, if you look at the market, we've got the heavy hitters"
"745820","747240"," coming out, right?"
"747580","751340"," We've got the, we've got the fed meaty coming up on, I believe the fourth and fifth, and then we've"
"751340","753040"," got mayo pecs coming out."
"753740","758840"," And it kind of lines up with getting the major earnings out of the way, and then finding some kind"
"758840","764280"," of weakness in the market as we head into middle to end of May."
"765660","769120"," So that's what I've been looking forward to in the coming weeks. "
"769560","770960"," We've got the 19th now, right?"
"771100","775320"," We've got to base seven of the 30 days until this plays out."
"775660","781160"," We could have some up moments in this market, but eventually it continued selling down between now"
"781160","783660"," and mid May would be expected from my point of view."
"784580","787040"," Now, I'm going to read the spot again report this morning. "
"788380","791020"," Our futures have a press lower to 4380."
"791280","794620"," Our levels involved till the expectations were in line with yesterday's data."
"795200","799740"," We look for a maximum move of 1.19% open a close with resistance at 4400. "
"799860","801280"," Take note of that 440, right?"
"801700","809300"," And the spy and support shows that 436, 435 and the spy beneath that level, we see 4300 as next"
"809900","810340"," support."
"810760","815480"," Additionally, flagged heavy net negative delta trading yesterday in the spies and queues, which has"
"815480","819600"," led to a plus 10 to plus 20% increase negative gamma for those ETFs."
"819740","821820"," This implies higher rates of potential volatility. "
"822400","824520"," We already experienced that yesterday, right?"
"825220","828400"," The market appears to be generally accepting these lower prices without much fear."
"829700","832680"," This feels kind of, you kind of feel comfortable down and around here, right?"
"832820","833520"," 430 at 440."
"834060","835760"," We talked about that last Friday, right?"
"836120","839160"," We expect to find a lower trading range this upcoming week. "
"839560","844120"," I know we had some disagreement on that on that topic, but you can see that that has worked itself"
"844120","845200"," out into this week."
"846000","849460"," The market appears to be generally accepting these low prices without much fear."
"849580","855500"," This morning, our risk reversal metric measures minus 0.05. So it's getting pretty close to zero,"
"856100","856300"," right?"
"856380","861260"," Which you'd expect a heavy call buying at this point, which is typically level associated with"
"861260","862840"," large bullish moves and equities. "
"863060","870880"," This indicates an increase in call option prices, despite right here, despite call volume demand"
"870880","871840"," not increasing."
"871920","873840"," This is important right here."
"873840","875080"," We're going to talk about this in just a month. "
"875540","879480"," Our initial thought is that this is due to dealer pricing of FMC meeting in early May."
"879980","882300"," The other implication is that puts may be relatively cheap."
"882500","885040"," So their point is that we should be ripping right now. "
"885840","889980"," We're not seeing, we're not seeing a call buying associated with this."
"890520","892120"," We're going to talk about that in just a moment, okay?"
"892620","896940"," So the 25 delta 38 risk reversal chart here, this should imply that we're going higher."
"897160","897940"," It should normally. "
"899120","901980"," Overall, it seems the market has reached something like exhaustion and equilibrium."
"902060","907720"," At this point, traders have had the opportunity to price in both fiscal monetary and jeep up"
"907720","909780"," political risks and sell accordingly."
"910960","914900"," It's also clear that the tail risk remains elevated, and that keeps the VIX elevated. "
"915200","920720"," The issue is for markets here is that of the S&P slides lower, it's likely dealer shorting starts"
"920720","922100"," to increase incrementally."
"922280","926680"," So the point being is this, is that normally right around this area here, right?"
"926840","930240"," You would see reversal right here where we are right now."
"930240","935480"," Instead of call buying entry of the market, what's actually taking place is you've got large banks"
"935480","936760"," like those black rocks. "
"937240","942320"," What they're doing is they're buying outside the money calls, and they're selling outside the money"
"942320","943180"," puts where we are."
"943500","946740"," So we're starting to trade somewhat sideways here, okay?"
"947200","951100"," And so they're in these complex, but you know, it's kind of a complex trade right now."
"951720","957420"," And yesterday, if you were trading yesterday, you saw you could actually see the banks step in and"
"957420","960980"," out of the market yesterday as they were selling puts and buying calls. "
"960980","964080"," Buying puts do it some that's two points during yesterday."
"964780","968280"," And the dealers were also shorting the market as well, stepping into doing that."
"968360","972280"," But you could actually see these banks buying these OTM calls yesterday. "
"973160","974300"," Very short dated too."
"974640","976960"," So you're like, these are zero dates yesterday."
"977400","983580"," We'll look for that this morning to see if that regime maintains itself today or if we begin to"
"983580","987300"," sell off either today or later in the week. "
"989220","992880"," So it's really, it's reached something of an exhaustion equilibrium, right?"
"992980","995120"," At this point, so we haven't seen the calls from the market."
"995280","998240"," All we're seeing is complex trades by banks is my point."
"999760","1001920"," It's also clear the tail risk remains elevated. "
"1002560","1005960"," And that keeps the VIX Ella at the issue for markets here is that the SP slides lower."
"1006060","1009460"," It's likely dealers shorting starts to increase incrementally."
"1010100","1012720"," And you can kind of see this point that they're trying to say, right?"
"1013020","1017820"," Is that you've got these you've got these complex trades being placed by large banks that are"
"1017820","1020580"," showing the price of calls increasing. "
"1021000","1022540"," Yet calls aren't being bought."
"1022880","1024400"," It's because they're part of a different package."
"1025240","1032160"," And then the then you start to see you start to see dealers short once we get to once we"
"1032160","1032760"," get to 440. "
"1033700","1036359"," So when we hit 440, dealers start to short."
"1037140","1038260"," And you saw that yesterday."
"1038900","1043800"," There is a fair amount of both calls and puts at 440, which by default produces mean reverting"
"1043800","1045119"," action into this strike. "
"1045319","1049940"," However, a sharp enough test lower may spur enough dealers short hedging to break the market to the"
"1049940","1052740"," downside for a quick test of 4300."
"1053200","1057080"," In this case, it could be something that would typically be easily absorbed by markets like a"
"1057080","1063200"," hawkish fed comment, i.e., if you see hawkish fed comments, right, it'll be absorbed will bounce"
"1063200","1065140"," and revert back to that 440."
"1065800","1072180"," If a downside cycle initiates from here, it creates a reflexive feedback loop where dealers are"
"1072180","1075760"," selling which drives higher implied volatility more downside demand. "
"1075980","1081680"," Further, the two events ahead that could break a cycle like this would be FOMC and May OPEX."
"1082700","1087480"," We think it's in these scenarios where the market is misplacing the risk of downside moves, i.e.,"
"1087480","1089780"," the risk reversal metric above due to the dealer position."
"1090600","1095000"," If this was a market with high positive gamma position, then you would have extra padding the"
"1095000","1097640"," dealer buying to absorb price dips. "
"1097820","1101680"," However, in this case, because we're below the vol trigger, I'll show you that later on where it's"
"1101680","1102080"," at too."
"1102700","1106680"," Dealers may need to start selling into lower market prices."
"1107560","1112080"," We think that upside risk to the upside, continue to remain muted as significant volatility selling"
"1112080","1117480"," likely cannot commence without clarity from the Fed or a resolution of geopolitical rates. "
"1118460","1120140"," So what does this mean for you as a trainer?"
"1121200","1122720"," They're saying a lot to you this morning."
"1123920","1125700"," So we're going to take a look at the spy this morning."
"1125880","1127400"," I think the volatility trigger might have changed. "
"1127720","1134500"," It might have come down a little bit, but it was somewhere, I believe it's at 4.45 right in"
"1134500","1135660"," this area here is your vote."
"1135780","1136700"," We'll call this the vol trigger."
"1137200","1138380"," We'll write this down here. "
"1138760","1139320"," It might have changed."
"1139540","1142180"," I haven't looked yet to see if it's changed, but it was right up here."
"1142260","1143420"," This is the vol trigger right here. "
"1144340","1147040"," If I find that it's changed, I'll move it."
"1147880","1148820"," But it's right up in here."
"1148960","1151280"," This is your negative gamma and your positive gamma. "
"1151600","1156780"," When we're down in this negative gamma area, you're going to see violent moves and a tendency to"
"1156780","1157520"," want to sell down."
"1158080","1161820"," And what they're also saying is that we'll revert back to this 440 line right here."
"1162140","1164620"," This is your resistance here at 440. "
"1165800","1171460"," We saw these these comments come out yesterday, but not enough to trigger selling in the market."
"1171660","1174800"," So we need an event for the market to actually roll over."
"1175180","1178040"," And right now with earnings season, you're not going to see that. "
"1178180","1181320"," So right now, you're looking for a couple things, right?"
"1181660","1184340"," You're looking to be buying these dips down below, right?"
"1184420","1186060"," We see the 430 down below here."
"1186480","1189320"," A quick retest of 430 might happen, right?"
"1189740","1191500"," You could possibly see a test as 430."
"1191980","1196880"," This is kind of the area down here that you're looking to find out if we get any kind of"
"1196880","1198880"," adding of puts, right?"
"1199220","1206260"," Well, big hedges and then like big hedges, we're going to be looking for a continued put buying,"
"1209580","1210300"," right?"
"1210560","1215800"," If we don't see continued put buying, if we're down here in this in this in this area, right?"
"1215880","1220700"," If we don't see that, if we don't see that down here, we'll see that rejection and another move"
"1220700","1222060"," higher to trade in this zone. "
"1222300","1226980"," And I kind of think that we don't move down and sell this market right now."
"1227000","1233960"," I think we wait until apples and let the apples and the Teslas and all these companies have their"
"1233960","1234240"," earnings."
"1234720","1236080"," And then you'll have that spill over. "
"1236220","1243320"," We start trade down to 430 and probably some lower numbers heading into FOMC and then OPEX for May."
"1244100","1245360"," What does that mean for you as a trader?"
"1245500","1247700"," It's 9.29. We got one minute left until 30 seconds left."
"1247900","1248980"," We open this market up right here. "
"1249260","1250840"," So what does that mean for you as a trader?"
"1251500","1256540"," It means that you're going to buy on weakness from Fed speakers the next couple days, right?"
"1256680","1258200"," You're selling them speaking of course."
"1258840","1263580"," And then we know that once we get up around this 440 area that you're going to sell, right?"
"1263900","1267300"," We start coming up here, you sell and then we start trading down here."
"1267320","1272460"," You're looking for opportunities to buy unless some some negative news comes into this market. "
"1272800","1275500"," So that's what this is what your day is for today, right?"
"1275920","1278320"," We know that the markets is rolling over."
"1278620","1279840"," We know that it's rolling over."
"1279960","1280860"," It's going to take some time. "
"1281100","1288740"," We know the next two events for this to take place are going to be in early May and mid"
"1288740","1289560"," to late May."
"1290080","1295800"," So until those events happen, until we get some of these ERs out of the way, we're going to expect"
"1295800","1296840"," the markets to go up, right?"
"1296960","1301420"," We see the bounce down below here, and we're going to expect, I'm going to draw this in here for"
"1301420","1301600"," you."
"1302500","1304360"," You expect some kind of trade higher, right?"
"1304820","1305600"," And then a sell off. "
"1305760","1309380"," And whenever you see these sell offs down, you're going to take your money and run and you're going"
"1309380","1310800"," to buy these dips down here."
"1310820","1312100"," I don't care if the dip is here."
"1312340","1314300"," We'll look at BookMap to see where they are. "
"1314580","1315300"," Could be here."
"1315540","1316460"," Could be down here."
"1316920","1318900"," Anywhere down here will buy these dips. "
"1319500","1321520"," And we're going to sell these rips above yesterday."
"1322020","1326560"," And yesterday I put a post out on Twitter that said, any rip that you see today, right?"
"1326860","1332200"," You're going to sell them, sell the rips every time that you can today, because one of these rips"
"1332200","1332840"," is going to catch."
"1333560","1335260"," We didn't get it yesterday here. "
"1335380","1336580"," We didn't get it yesterday here."
"1336940","1343060"," But at some point, you're going to see an opportunity up here to sell a rip that's going to"
"1343060","1346400"," actually take take hold and print huge, okay?"
"1346860","1347680"," As we move forward."
"1348180","1351240"," So this is your chart for today, if you need a chart for today. "
"1352280","1353840"," I'm going to move this over right here."
"1353920","1354700"," We can sell away here."
"1355560","1358940"," I'm going to bring up your, bring up your BookMap for you here alone. "
"1359800","1361240"," Get that BookMap here for you."
"1361560","1363620"," And we're already taking a look at the opening bell here, right?"
"1363740","1366540"," You can see these sellers above at 440-50."
"1367240","1376560"," You can see some sellers already stepping in for the open right here at 430-450, 430-450, 440 "
"1376560","1379000","-50 right up in here just off the bell. "
"1379760","1382900"," And we're going to look below and see where real support is."
"1383360","1386400"," We've got some support down below here at 436-50."
"1387840","1391180"," Let me see if I can bring this back and forth. "
"1391180","1393200"," You can see this right here at 436-50."
"1395040","1398820"," And you can see it's just down below in this area here where my cursor is, right?"
"1399360","1401800"," And you can see the sellers above up in here."
"1402120","1406420"," We're having anticipation of a 1% move today, right?"
"1406660","1412180"," And then if we break that down below this 435-50, it's a fast run down below. "
"1412320","1413420"," You see 430 down here."
"1413980","1416480"," You see there's not much support down here, right?"
"1417240","1419660"," Let me see if I can bring this a little bit closer for you."
"1420620","1425260"," And you kind of see if this support breaks, we have a date with 430 down below. "
"1425940","1427320"," We'll look even lower from here."
"1428000","1431800"," But generally speed, that's 430 is basically where we want to see the market go."
"1432860","1433880"," So what are we looking for?"
"1435640","1437340"," We got these sellers right here. "
"1437420","1440100"," We got more sellers above at 440."
"1442280","1446060"," And these initial sellers here at 438-70."
"1446900","1448700"," And again, at 438-07. "
"1450180","1452740"," So you can get that trip down to 430."
"1458800","1459960"," Let me just second here."
"1460020","1461980"," I got to line up some stuff to buy. "
"1467890","1477890"," So we got people already out there buying 430Ps for April 20th at $0.36, $0.37. And there's"
"1477890","1485690"," some buyers on 440C for $1.75. I don't like that $1.75. It seems like a price."
"1485990","1487890"," It seems like very expensive calls."
"1488650","1491430"," Now they're down at $0.72 for a minute there. "
"1492190","1494790"," I don't want to buy calls at $1.73 ever."
"1495190","1496250"," You guys all know that, right?"
"1496390","1497530"," These are April 20th."
"1497650","1500050"," So calls for tomorrow. "
"1500890","1507290"," They're down up to $1.78, there's 7,000 buyers of those calls right now."
"1512090","1514490"," They're $1.75 right now."
"1514530","1523510"," But there's a bunch of buyers on the 440Cs and 430Ps for April 20th. "
"1529350","1529750"," So let me see."
"1529850","1531070"," We'll keep this one up here right here."
"1531210","1532530"," We'll look at this one right here. "
"1534740","1537580"," It looks like we're blasting off right up the opening bell here."
"1539000","1543060"," We'll see if this continues on to this resistance area above here at 440."
"1552240","1554900"," All right, let me scroll through and see what you guys are saying this morning here. "
"1556360","1557700"," Yeah, I got some stuff to talk."
"1557900","1559740"," I was, I like Tesla this morning too."
"1559740","1564580"," I like Tesla and I like both Tesla and Twitter this morning. "
"1565160","1568880"," I was looking at Tesla on another, let me see if I can bring it up here."
"1569680","1572640"," Oh yeah, this looks like we bring this over."
"1572840","1574260"," I was charting out Tesla this morning. "
"1575300","1576280"," I was liking Tesla."
"1577860","1579980"," Let me see if I can bring this back over here."
"1581200","1583200"," It's kind of liking the idea of Tesla. "
"1583860","1584500"," Kind of like this consolidation."
"1585120","1586460"," This is a big huge bear flag overall."
"1587160","1590360"," And I think it does, I think it does eventually sell off. "
"1590540","1592980"," But I like the idea of Tesla trading higher here."
"1593460","1597120"," So we'll take a look at Tesla this morning and see if it can get up to that 1030 or"
"1597120","1597460"," so."
"1597980","1601400"," We'll load Tesla up and then we'll take a look at Twitter as well. "
"1602240","1603860"," Listen, I look at both of those today."
"1604980","1607960"," So I'll bring up Tesla here and I'm going to bring up Twitter."
"1611800","1615260"," So we can take a look at all of these and see what's going on with these tickers. "
"1616200","1617520"," And I want to see it."
"1617620","1619120"," I want to see if I can get some some Tesla."
"1619460","1622040"," I might buy some Tesla today at some point and get a good price on it. "
"1622860","1626860"," And we'll look up Twitter as well, TWTR."
"1628900","1629980"," Let's look at both of these."
"1633100","1635300"," So I'm checking out Twitter here, right?"
"1635540","1637400"," This is where we were, this is where we were down here. "
"1637440","1639760"," We were trading this, I believe, on Friday."
"1640820","1644320"," And then I like this buy down here and this buy down here."
"1644780","1649140"," And I like the idea, if there's a little bit of market weakness today, that there might be an"
"1649140","1654660"," opportunity to buy another one of these continuations higher. "
"1655220","1658780"," There was a nice buy down here, a nice buy down here, and a nice buy down here."
"1659160","1664360"," So my expectation that if we see any weakness in Twitter, we can ride that higher."
"1665500","1667620"," The next thing would be Tesla. "
"1668660","1669860"," Good Tesla again."
"1672260","1674120"," Selling off slightly in Tesla too."
"1674200","1677000"," In this little mark right down here, you can see it right back here. "
"1677080","1677920"," I'm just going to bring this back."
"1678560","1679100"," Hold on here."
"1680860","1682180"," Let me get some of this over here. "
"1683000","1684480"," I don't know what's going on over here."
"1685120","1687260"," Got some weirdness going on with my charting this morning."
"1687260","1691160"," And see this right here, right?"
"1691520","1695580"," Nice little buy down here, nice little buy down here, nice little buy down here. "
"1696000","1701980"," So if you're a Tesla, bro, or Tesla, how do you say like girl, like bro, like Tesla girl, or"
"1701980","1708420"," something like that, I'd be looking for any kind of a buy down below here, calling it like it's"
"1708420","1709540"," some below a thousand."
"1709720","1717960"," I know every like thousand dollars, but I'm looking more like a 990 or 980 as a buy, especially if"
"1717960","1722860"," if spy shows a little bit of weakness, at any point could be today, could be tomorrow, just seeing"
"1722860","1728500"," kind of a place to buy a bounce, even if it trades higher today, and it comes down here, I'm"
"1728500","1733080"," looking for this zone down here as a buy for me on Tesla."
"1734540","1740220"," If you're going to continue to trade this, there's been some great buys down here on Tesla as well. "
"1740480","1745080"," So keep this in mind, if you're a Tesla bull to be looking for, and you can see them down"
"1745080","1750040"," here, right, BAM, there's one BAM, there's two, if this happens in after hours, let's say you see"
"1750040","1757080"," Tesla, I don't know, trade sideways only long, and then it does this kind of a move in after hours"
"1757080","1761920"," or something in pre market, I would buy this from this point right here, that's to go higher."
"1762480","1763500"," So that's what I'm looking for."
"1763600","1769080"," I'm looking for some kind of weakness down here that I can buy somewhere down in here. "
"1770080","1778920"," Let's keep that in mind, especially if the market gets a quick trip down below on the spy, and"
"1778920","1782860"," we'll see how all three of these how all three of these charts cut kind of interact with"
"1782860","1788420"," themselves, when we're looking for some kind of weakness above here on or in spy at some point."
"1796560","1798380"," Let's see what you guys are talking about this morning."
"1798720","1800900"," I got top chat, then I got live chat. "
"1802040","1803500"," See you guys are doing here."
"1804140","1804820"," Good morning, everybody."
"1805140","1806020"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"1806700","1809660"," Yep, Tesla gang, I reviewed for Tesla gang for you guys. "
"1810060","1810580"," Let's make some money."
"1810740","1811080"," Hell, yeah."
"1812020","1813000"," Good morning, everybody. "
"1813400","1815980"," Gold is going to 1750 to add right on."
"1816480","1818400"," I like, I've been liking gold the past couple weeks."
"1818520","1821140"," What's up, tap, whatever, but hey, hey, Dan, how are you, Liam?"
"1821540","1822400"," Chris, how are you?"
"1822900","1823480"," Good to see you, Chris. "
"1824580","1826400"," Did he say this is the easiest market trade?"
"1826580","1826780"," I did."
"1827440","1828380"," I think it is easy."
"1828920","1831280"," I think it's been very easy. "
"1836580","1838200"," 30 bear bond continues to get smashed."
"1838300","1841200"," I don't think we see a rally till bonds rally."
"1841200","1845500"," There's a $1,000 seller on $4,440. "
"1845860","1850880"," Yeah, there's, I think what they're doing, well, what SparkM is implying that they're doing is"
"1850880","1858360"," they're doing the, they're doing this trade where you're, well, I guess they could switch between a"
"1858360","1861540"," short or a long trade."
"1861780","1864520"," You could actually be, this is basically a collar, right?"
"1864920","1868740"," Basically a collar trade, and they're running, but right now they're running them on just zero"
"1868740","1872240"," dates or one dates, or at least yesterday they were, and they're kind of wild."
"1875400","1876560"," Missed the first 20 minutes. "
"1876560","1878120"," We're going down this week still."
"1879520","1882900"," They had everything above that pulled yesterday at some point."
"1883140","1883580"," Yep, yep. "
"1885320","1886040"," Good morning."
"1887080","1889660"," I love who said 10-year-old Top of 3-2."
"1890120","1892220"," Look at F, it's an outside day. "
"1893240","1893760"," Good morning, Kat."
"1893980","1894280"," Good morning, Matt."
"1894520","1894760"," How are you?"
"1895100","1895360"," Tesla. "
"1895920","1899020"," Yeah, basically Chase, that's what it is."
"1899900","1901600"," Now, if you could miss these, right?"
"1901720","1903720"," We're kind of in the no-go zone right now to call it."
"1903900","1908840"," So if you're looking at it from right here, this isn't really the place you want to be short nor"
"1908840","1909460"," longing, right?"
"1909560","1914220"," You want to be buying these bottoms and selling these tops up here, and we're kind of in the"
"1914220","1914480"," middle. "
"1914860","1915600"," How do you call this?"
"1915820","1919840"," You just buy in calls here, start buying puts here."
"1920740","1921480"," I don't know the answer to that."
"1921580","1925080"," I know the answer above is that the sellers are waiting right here. "
"1926380","1927520"," These are where your sellers are."
"1927680","1931240"," We know this, and this is where the sellers are, right?"
"1932220","1935640"," And we know that the buyers right now are down below, right?"
"1935780","1937280"," We already know that the buyers are down here."
"1938160","1940080"," Now, you could, I guess you could have bought this bell down here. "
"1941280","1944760"," But for me, I'm talking to you guys, and I'm in a hard time getting in the market right now."
"1944980","1946860"," And I also don't like buying calls."
"1947500","1952840"," I don't like buying 440Cs that cost $1.74. I think they're smoking crack. "
"1954120","1955540"," Those were down here yesterday."
"1955780","1959860"," They were, I think the, Laura, I don't know what they think these ones cost yesterday, but some"
"1959860","1963700"," calls down here yesterday were like eight cents, six cents, some stupid like that."
"1964320","1969660"," So I'm not really a fan of buying $1.70 calls on the open of Tuesday up in here. "
"1970240","1974740"," I'd buy some calls down here though, and a minute, a moment I'd buy some calls and up here, I'd"
"1974740","1977160"," sell the market up here too, right?"
"1978360","1981680"," So where we are right now is, you're going to be reactionary."
"1981900","1985540"," You're looking for where the market goes right now."
"1986020","1991320"," You're looking for a decision if the market's going to go up here, you'll sell this. "
"1991420","1995680"," If the market's going to sell down here, you're going to buy this down here, or even down lower to"
"1995680","2000020"," 430, because we can see where the, if the banks are in and out yesterday, it was wild."
"2000500","2005500"," I took a few trades yesterday and it was wild to see the buyers and sellers step in."
"2005500","2008320"," Matter of fact, something similar to this right here. "
"2009120","2013860"," So this would be an all black area yesterday, and then out of nowhere, you'd see a big orange bar"
"2013860","2018040"," just step in and buy the bottoms yesterday."
"2018520","2020520"," And then the same thing was happening on the tops yesterday."
"2020880","2024600"," You'd see the sellers step in and force. "
"2025240","2028200"," As a matter of fact, we said 440 was the top today."
"2028560","2032680"," It's more than likely 44050 as we can see here, and we can trade all the way up to the"
"2032680","2033640"," 240."
"2034340","2036780"," So this is no-go zone for me at this point, right?"
"2037140","2038480"," I don't want to be trading here. "
"2038760","2046300"," I want to be trading here, and I want to be trading down below down below at that 430, right?"
"2046420","2048060"," I want to buy this 430 down here."
"2049440","2050420"," You can see it."
"2050600","2058639"," There's some buyers down here at 437 for intraday, and you can see it down below right here. "
"2059080","2060920"," This is major, kind of major support."
"2061699","2065699"," So I want to be buying those, and I want to be selling these above here."
"2068800","2071360"," We'll see if we can crank it up here and see how high we can get. "
"2072020","2078500"," Matter of fact, I'm going to reset the options below for you so we can see it through the idea"
"2078500","2079420"," of where we are on the day."
"2081420","2082400"," Let me just take it here."
"2085040","2085820"," Close that up. "
"2087860","2092679"," We'll see what we got coming in off the bell this morning with the initial flow is off the bell."
"2093699","2097860"," Seeing calls, five orders on NVIDIA for a thousand or a million dollars."
"2098120","2099520"," Baba's got a bid to it this morning. "
"2100600","2102100"," ATER has a bid on it."
"2102440","2104020"," That's Alpha Tango Echo Romeo."
"2104940","2106740"," Caesars has a bid on it this morning. "
"2107320","2107760"," CZR."
"2107920","2109180"," JPM has a bid on it."
"2109900","2111380"," BAC has a bid on it. "
"2111460","2112460"," Netflix has a bid on it."
"2112580","2112920"," Small bid."
"2113740","2116720"," We've got some trades against on Baidu and Baba. "
"2117300","2120520"," Baba's got a split decision going on at this morning."
"2121080","2124440"," Some negative flow on Apple as well in NVIDIA."
"2126220","2127680"," Plug has some Selva news. "
"2128480","2130900"," They have a deal that's just come out, I believe, with Walmart."
"2131140","2132080"," I could be wrong on that one."
"2132660","2135460"," So they want to sell the news on plug off the bell this morning. "
"2135940","2137500"," That's all day trader type stuff."
"2139700","2146080"," Let me flip back over here to watch the rest of the flow."
"2149100","2151780"," And so we just talked about this a few moments ago, right?"
"2151900","2155160"," We talked about not wanting to pick a direction, the wrong direction. "
"2155340","2156660"," That'd be a gambling, right?"
"2157420","2162400"," So it kind of positions us looking for a place to take a short up in here, right?"
"2162840","2163900"," We'll look a little bit closer here."
"2164780","2167220"," We know the ball trigger is up here."
"2167480","2173000"," We know that anything up in here or above here is going to be bullish, right?"
"2173120","2175820"," We know that anything below this area here is bearish. "
"2176240","2180000"," We know that there are sellers all up in here."
"2180200","2182600"," All up in here, there are sellers, okay?"
"2185520","2187480"," So sellers hiding all above here."
"2188240","2190960"," So you can take pick your poison or your pick when you want to enter. "
"2191520","2192660"," Pulling the hill on here a second."
"2194300","2195460"," I'll close this out."
"2196480","2199760"," And we'll I'll let you know because I think those puts are getting kind of cheap. "
"2199940","2201040"," I like the idea of those puts."
"2201620","2205100"," Those 430Ps are now down to 23.22 cents."
"2205300","2208080"," There's 20,000 buyers now on 440. "
"2208760","2210900"," See two dollars and 18 cents."
"2211520","2213060"," Two dollars and 15 cents."
"2215420","2215860"," Thanks. "
"2215960","2216680"," I'm going to buy some puts."
"2242520","2249220"," Now we've got 20,000 buyers of calls for two dollars and six cents on the 440 side."
"2249900","2253240"," And it looks like some of the put buyers are being squeezed out on that 430. "
"2253940","2257380"," They've gone the number of buyers of 430Ps have gone down."
"2257880","2265980"," We're down to 24 cents on puts for Wednesday expiry or down to 23 cents."
"2266600","2268260"," So let's see if we can touch above here. "
"2268700","2277400"," Looking for a price target above of 440.50. And then we're just going to bring that 440 to 440 "
"2277400","2286100",".50. So I'm going to move that that spot camera level up here."
"2287080","2288980"," The tags were right in this zone here."
"2289460","2291820"," We'll see if we can get some rollover like we did yesterday. "
"2293460","2329500"," We'll look to see how much resistance there is to"
"2329500","2333180"," my trigger finger on some 430Ps."
"2334020","2339140"," Aspiring Wednesday, I'm going to wait until to execute this trade until we come up here and tag"
"2339140","2340880"," this 440 zone up here."
"2340960","2343240"," I'm looking for a rejection here at 440. "
"2346200","2348860"," So we'll look above it and see how high we can go."
"2349780","2357040"," I've got all this volatility here to 440, 440, 443."
"2358520","2363200"," And then 445 is, you know, we had the valve trigger at 445. "
"2364020","2366180"," I'm going to call the valve trigger higher at 446."
"2367080","2368700"," I know that it was at 445."
"2369840","2372300"," I'm going to change that to 446 actually. "
"2373780","2375040"," And move this up higher."
"2381080","2384700"," So I'm going to move my valve trigger, head it down to 445."
"2385380","2386700"," So I'm going to move it up here to 446. "
"2388340","2393000"," This would be where your major resistance is on the spy."
"2394020","2401510"," A quick little bounce off of a spy currently."
"2402290","2406730"," I still am about put to wait for another retest above and then I'll buy some. "
"2416040","2420660"," Joe Harper is asking if the butterfly is a good play on the spy."
"2420660","2425260"," I don't think so possibly."
"2425760","2434740"," My concern here is, my concern here is, so let's see what, let's look at what Spock Emma's saying. "
"2434900","2438940"," They're basically saying you could have to look here."
"2442330","2445990"," Their point is, you know, well, we know that we're bouncing off above, right?"
"2446570","2451530"," We get us some rejection above here and then see a tag down below this 430."
"2453670","2454150"," Right?"
"2454230","2458310"," If we don't get that continued put buying, we don't have any events that we have continued put"
"2458310","2458750"," buying on. "
"2459010","2464070"," All we have today would be a move higher and then some speakers at 12 PM, right?"
"2464290","2469770"," We know about, we've got hawkish fed speakers at noon time and that could send the market down,"
"2469770","2470570"," right?"
"2471230","2472850"," That we had the same thing happen yesterday."
"2473530","2479870"," We should get a bounce off of 430 unless some other event arises that we don't know about."
"2480250","2484330"," We can also get a bounce out down below here and even a bounce down below here. "
"2486470","2492970"," So Joe Harper's asked the question, do you just put on a butterfly or condor for this trade here?"
"2493070","2493530"," I don't think so."
"2493630","2499470"," I think I think that you're just looking for sellers above and you're looking for buyers below"
"2499470","2500270"," currently."
"2500950","2506270"," And the question becomes, can we have continued selling a rollover in the market?"
"2506270","2509250"," Probably not until the major ERs are done. "
"2509650","2515290"," You probably maintain this trading, this rollover and trading and bouncing around from stock to"
"2515290","2518530"," stock depending upon the earnings season that we have."
"2518930","2521190"," So the question comes, do you put on a condor or a butterfly?"
"2522370","2522850"," Maybe."
"2523270","2529270"," I would say that if you're going to do a condor or a butterfly, you're going to call the top"
"2529270","2538690"," here, call it 443 and then maybe you could go really wide butterfly up here at 446 and then"
"2538690","2541690"," do 430 down below. "
"2541810","2542210"," That's pretty big."
"2542210","2544590"," It's a pretty big trading range right here."
"2545530","2548130"," We would trade in this zone here. "
"2548790","2550250"," But for myself, what am I looking for?"
"2550350","2555530"," I'm looking to sell this and then I'm looking to buy the dip down below."
"2556090","2563710"," Because I think that what they're applying is that the market is being it's not manipulated, but"
"2563710","2572190"," for further downside risk, if you're not going to get those events, the key being if you're not"
"2572190","2578610"," going to get FOMC, if you're not going to get OPEC, then you won't see heavy selling unless"
"2578610","2582030"," something else happens other than a negative Fed comment."
"2582530","2585910"," I would say we were green until 5 p.m. and then we started selling off. "
"2586730","2591850"," If you're spread or if you butterfly your condor is not wide enough to account for this 430 or this"
"2591850","2596070"," 443, 446 area, then you could get burned in this trade."
"2596670","2601550"," Maybe if you do it for Friday, I like the idea of a condor for Friday."
"2602310","2603290"," Yeah, I like that Joe. "
"2604330","2604870"," Not a bad question."
"2606650","2607910"," Not a bad question."
"2608110","2609210"," Will condor work here?"
"2609310","2609770"," Yeah, it's possible. "
"2611450","2614130"," Maybe on the opening bell would have been better, right?"
"2614370","2615910"," Use trade higher and then we'd trade lower."
"2616710","2628850"," Now, trading to 440.51. Testing this upper resistance here at 440.53. Those"
"2628850","2633670"," calls are up to $2.78. They were at $1.78 at the opening bell."
"2635150","2637850"," So we'll see if we trade higher from here or if this is it. "
"2672500","2673920"," I'm going back down in here."
"2676000","2678420"," Nice break of resistance above it."
"2678580","2684360"," 440.63. 440.70. Let's see if we continue higher here and we can trade higher. "
"2688480","2689720"," Let's see if we can bring this back down."
"2690440","2692380"," We'll take a look at the five day here."
"2695220","2696860"," R1.440. R2. "
"2697040","2697360"," 443."
"2698400","2708170"," And then the vol triggers at 4.46. Take a look at Tesla real quick."
"2710510","2718760"," I'll add in some here indicator and close that up. "
"2725860","2735850"," Looks like volatility above here at 10.20. Then room to run to 10.35 and 10 "
"2735850","2739670",".40. Then 10.50 would be the actual price target on Tesla."
"2741530","2743310"," We'll look at Twitter next."
"2756000","2758720"," Lots of pressure on Twitter. "
"2759700","2760880"," Sellers above that."
"2761180","2766670"," They have three levels for Twitter to look at and get these."
"2768230","2770090"," 50.52 and then 54. "
"2772330","2779390"," Here indicator is generally positive on lots of call buying off the open and then starts the trail"
"2779390","2780530"," off slightly on Twitter."
"2781210","2784170"," Let's look at the here indicator for Tesla as well."
"2787220","2789620"," Consistent call buying on Tesla as well. "
"2791200","2801140"," Watching call buying on JD, Apple, Space, NVIDIA, Plug, Q's, X and A-ter still."
"2801740","2803360"," Still seeing calls on A-ter."
"2804660","2809060"," We'll take a look at spy real quick and see if we have continued call buying above here. "
"2811420","2816940"," Call buying has slipped off a little bit since 9.53. Starting to turn slightly negative."
"2817880","2821680"," We'll see if this works out for the bears or if we continue to trade higher."
"2822120","2826060"," It does look like the resistance was broken here on the spy. "
"2829950","2835030"," The volatility all the way up says that 4.43.40 or so."
"2835710","2844810"," Then we've got the next resistance above at 4.45 and 4.44.40. It's a nice little target above"
"2844810","2862630"," here at 4.45. Yeah,"
"2864850","2867910"," my wife came and talked to me about taxes two weeks ago."
"2868190","2868930"," It wasn't pretty. "
"2870810","2874050"," It was not it was not happy with taxes this year."
"2874730","2877210"," It was not happy at all."
"2880050","2883850"," Thankfully my wife, we have some of the prepares our taxes. "
"2884390","2892610"," My wife deals with taxes and this is going to be a doozy this year for tax season for a"
"2892610","2893390"," lot of people out there."
"2893470","2897230"," I think I'm paying this year big money."
"2908600","2912560"," Yeah, we'll see if we we'll see if we this still resistance above here. "
"2912580","2918460"," You can see the resistance looks like some buyers still down below at this 4.40. Looks like it gets"
"2918460","2919420"," some nice support growth."
"2919520","2920200"," See this right here."
"2920200","2921520"," This is what we saw yesterday. "
"2922100","2930380"," We saw buyers step back in at this 4.40. And we saw this yesterday in the in the in"
"2930380","2930960"," the days trading."
"2931620","2935620"," So we'll see if the buyers actually if they broke pull it or if they maintain it."
"2935940","2944860"," We have volatility from here to 4.43.40 and then clear skies to 4.45.20. So we'll see"
"2944860","2948920"," if the dip buyers see a little down below here at this 4.40. We'll see if the dip buyers"
"2948920","2953080"," step in at 4.40 or if they pull the rug here in just a moment. "
"2960450","2963370"," I grabbed some I grabbed some cheap puts right here just in case."
"2964310","2965210"," I'll cut them loose."
"2965210","2975110"," The buyers don't keep stepping in to drive it up to 4.44. You also"
"2975110","2980250"," the VIX coming down to a localized support area at 21.90 something. "
"2980550","3001200"," Also watching calls"
"3001200","3002960"," coming on Netflix or no, what is this?"
"3004220","3011060"," N-T-N-X July 15th 20C for $1.7 million."
"3012240","3022200"," Also puts coming in on HZ-NP for $629,000 and also OVV for May 20th strikes on"
"3022200","3022560"," those puts."
"3024600","3028980"," Some dip buyers stepping in on the spy right now as well. "
"3029780","3031840"," Some spy dip buyers stepping in currently."
"3045890","3048890"," So I'm going to say there's a trillion dollars owed to the treasury."
"3051890","3055570"," Yeah, Jill, I remember you were talking about the small mistake that you had that cost money. "
"3060990","3062250"," Nutanix you thought they were acquired."
"3062490","3067450"," You haven't seen some weird strikes come in this morning like you don't ever see right?"
"3067950","3068550"," ATER is"
"3068550","3078090"," not normal."
"3080010","3082770"," This laptop is so far away from me, I can't see it. "
"3083670","3093110"," N-T-N-X has July 15th 20C for almost $2 million."
"3093790","3097970"," That's pretty significant for a $20 ticker for calls."
"3098330","3099850"," Then space has got a huge bid in it. "
"3100350","3102450"," Watching more dip buyers stepping in on the spy currently."
"3117990","3119670"," Let's take a look at the spy here."
"3121590","3125150"," Now there were some buyers stepping in in this zone right in here. "
"3125670","3131630"," They came in so we'll see if the dip buyers stay in here and try to propel it up for"
"3131630","3132610"," the next leg up."
"3162610","3164070"," Yeah, I got hurt this year."
"3164250","3164650"," My taxes. "
"3166270","3169690"," Not hurt bad enough where I needed to mortgage off the property or anything."
"3170570","3175350"," But I bet you that a bunch of and that's crazy part is if if it had been slightly higher,"
"3175790","3180710"," I probably would have had to have taken the second mortgage without a doubt."
"3186020","3187460"," Yeah, should we look at ATER?"
"3196460","3199000"," I think it looks like I've charted this one. "
"3200320","3204700"," We talked about we must have talked about ATER right because I've got it charted here."
"3207670","3209950"," So I don't know who brought that up in the stream but someone did."
"3211810","3213450"," I guess I can make that longer now. "
"3214830","3215590"," That's ridiculous."
"3218590","3219410"," Look at that."
"3220250","3221490"," That's just pure insanity. "
"3224130","3226210"," Absolutely 100% out of its trading range."
"3226570","3229550"," I might have to take the I'm going to take a short on this on this trade right here."
"3229930","3230690"," This is beautiful. "
"3231110","3231630"," Look at that."
"3231850","3232650"," That's Encino."
"3234510","3236290"," I didn't even get a price target on this one. "
"3236850","3238510"," Blown past one right there."
"3238510","3239490"," Blown past the door."
"3239590","3243030"," I guess we're right on summaries distance right here for the next leg, right?"
"3247140","3248860"," It seems like it seems like it can pump. "
"3249440","3250120"," It was at 50."
"3251200","3252800"," So it's not like I can't get there."
"3255120","3256700"," It's not like it can't get crazy. "
"3256700","3260680"," A lot of money going into it this morning."
"3265840","3266820"," We'll take a look at ATER."
"3271770","3273130"," Let's bring up at ATER real quick. "
"3279860","3281620"," We'll load this one up and see what's going on."
"3289470","3290630"," So yeah, no big deal."
"3292510","3295550"," It's got more sellers than buyers right now. "
"3297910","3299330"," That'd be a nice short actually."
"3302690","3308370"," No, it's not really a big short until it's a lot of buyers here, but the really big shorts is"
"3308370","3308690"," 750."
"3318710","3322750"," Maybe even eight dollars and a half million sellers up here. "
"3323730","3325390"," A quarter million down here at 750."
"3330200","3332000"," Seems like a lot of support down here though."
"3336060","3338240"," And the buyer is still down here at six bucks too. "
"3345830","3346690"," Jesus, look at that."
"3347230","3348050"," That shit's monster."
"3349470","3349890"," That's ridiculous. "
"3350970","3353690"," I think when we charted this, they even said it becomes down, you can buy it."
"3354150","3355470"," I didn't even have a chance to come down."
"3355590","3356550"," I just fucking went up. "
"3362080","3362920"," That's fucking crazy."
"3365080","3372560"," So put a put a sell on it at that eight dollars."
"3373720","3381860"," Here's some major sellers above two at 7.45. And then if you wanted a dip to buy six bucks,"
"3382100","3384720"," it seems like it seems like a reasonable place to buy the dip. "
"3385540","3386220"," Pull on here."
"3391980","3394560"," Looks like they're coming back up again for more."
"3394820","3397700"," Like they're left here and they're coming back up to support at 650. "
"3404480","3406060"," I like the stonk."
"3409600","3411600"," See what, uh, see what Spy's doing."
"3411880","3413040"," I haven't looked at Spy in a few minutes. "
"3416380","3418880"," Spy smashing and bashing, breaking above 440."
"3420100","3423020"," I was looking for some sort of a resistance up here at 440."
"3423360","3424380"," Not seeing it as of yet. "
"3424820","3428520"," You can see that same volatility is all the way to 444."
"3429680","3433520"," You can see just massive sellers up in here."
"3434460","3437540"," Let's get a price target of 443. "
"3438940","3439880"," Let me see."
"3443390","3448650"," I didn't go all the way up to 4.4.309, I think."
"3450510","3452050"," Let's see if we can see it up here. "
"3453410","3454230"," It even higher."
"3456250","3458350"," 4.43.67 possibly."
"3461480","3464120"," We'll see if these sellers continue to come in. "
"3471380","3473580"," Yeah, put buyers are definitely stepping in now."
"3476580","3478580"," Let me get this back here to look."
"3482340","3483340"," Hopefully they get squeezed. "
"3493170","3494590"," See if we can take a look at the chart."
"3494790","3495330"," Oh, wait a minute."
"3495570","3496990"," Oh, let's bring that chart back up. "
"3504580","3505700"," One, two, boom."
"3506740","3508580"," Can we get out of the way up to 443?"
"3509280","3523270"," 4.46. Let's take a look at 443 and 4.46. There's"
"3523270","3524130"," no resistance here."
"3526810","3530190"," 4.43. 4.44. Pair of 4.43. 73. "
"3532110","3533350"," And then here's where they're selling."
"3533610","3535190"," 4.45.06 looks like a target."
"3535750","3536690"," 4.45. Possibly. "
"3537590","3546930"," 4.45.05. And some more sellers above at 4.45.90. That would be a nice trade."
"3546930","3551290"," If this could trade up to 4.46, it'd be a very nice trade."
"3552890","3554310"," Another 50-point move. "
"3556370","3559270"," Spies already up to 0.86% on the day."
"3560270","3564530"," Implied moves, they, I believe, was 1.10%. So still some room to move higher."
"3577660","3613950"," 4.40 C is now trading up to $3.47. There"
"3613950","3620840"," are no sellers here anymore. "
"3621640","3622920"," Some sellers, but not really."
"3623060","3623480"," We can trade."
"3624520","3625360"," Easily trade. "
"3625860","3644720"," This is 4.45. 4.46. Just"
"3644720","3645900"," keeps clapping, baby."
"3662010","3663250"," What's 10.09?"
"3663510","3669430"," Chase, it's 10.09. So you've got two hours until any kind of volatility enters the market."
"3670650","3677730"," So I would say is either cut them or hold them and add to them around $12.30 or buy"
"3677730","3687820"," some calls and then add some more puts at $12.00. Now"
"3687820","3694980"," trading a 4.42 flat for, well, no, it was going to say for $4.24. We'll get the biggest"
"3694980","3696100"," weed smoking day tomorrow. "
"3739700","3742520"," Spies still trading at $4.42.14 now."
"3743900","3745300"," No resistance above."
"3745600","3747880"," The sellers have gone away on the spy currently. "
"3748860","3789440"," Well, I don't see any resistance still above until right up here, $4.45 buying the"
"3789440","3790440"," selling calls in here."
"3814240","3821640"," Now trading at $4.42.60. I'm not seeing any sellers until there's some volatility in here, but $4 "
"3821640","3825160",".45. There seems to be some resistance here."
"3825340","3829360"," $4.46 then $4.45 right up in this area here. "
"3843680","3847100"," So I'm trading calls as we go up and I bought some puts."
"3847840","3850140"," Let's see if buying cheap puts at the bottom here."
"3850140","3853820"," Here and I'm going to add some more right in here. "
"3859930","3861130"," Let me bring this back over."
"3871020","3872680"," Let's see if we can find where the sellers are."
"3880620","3882040"," Now price targets still remains. "
"3882280","3907720"," This is $4.45.10 and the big sellers are up here, $4.46.0. Yeah,"
"3907720","3908480"," I keep adding to puts."
"3909120","3912340"," I'm trading calls and puts at the same time."
"3915260","3916480"," So I'm loading the fuck out. "
"3916600","3918980"," I'm trading these as we go higher here."
"3921370","3927160"," As we go higher here, let's see if I can bring this over here."
"3929800","3932060"," Let me give you some levels that I'm buying puts at. "
"3932280","3938700"," I bought some one."
"3939160","3942980"," I bought some puts here."
"3943700","3944640"," I just bought some more puts. "
"3944880","3946200"," They're like 13 cents or something."
"3947160","3949020"," I added some more right in here somewhere."
"3949780","3950240"," Two. "
"3952500","3959340"," So I like the idea of this resistance at $4.43. And then I'm going to add again two puts."
"3959540","3964460"," If we get up there, I'm going to add some more somewhere around this $4.45, somewhere in this area"
"3964460","3964720"," here."
"3965680","3966140"," Three. "
"3968780","3969680"," Right up in here."
"3970740","3977900"," Now, meanwhile, if we don't see, meanwhile, as I add these puts in here towards the end of the"
"3977900","3984340"," week, I'm also looking for moments of support like a bike calls in, right?"
"3984760","3989740"," Buy some calls, sell them, buy some calls, sell them, buy some calls, sell them as I add to a"
"3989740","3990100"," put position."
"3990280","3991900"," This put position I'm not getting rid of. "
"3992460","3993420"," Like these I'm just holding."
"3993740","3994480"," I'm just holding these."
"3994720","3995480"," I'm not going to fuck with them. "
"3997990","4000130"," I'm just going to keep adding to them and dollar cost average in."
"4000710","4009470"," And then in here, if we get some support, if the, if the, let's say buyers continue to step in,"
"4009470","4015390"," I'll trade to long and re-time me go up."
"4015610","4021470"," So if we have another, feeling a little, another nice little bull flag here, we trade up higher. "
"4021730","4023710"," I'll just add more calls each time we trade higher."
"4026700","4028340"," I don't know if that makes sense to y'all."
"4029820","4030960"," And that's what I'm looking for. "
"4036960","4040400"," We'll look here to see if buyers step back in."
"4042120","4043980"," And if not, where the price target would be."
"4046210","4067960"," Still down here at this 440.03. How"
"4067960","4068920"," are the sellers on Tesla?"
"4069280","4070100"," Let's look up Tesla real quick. "
"4077460","4078640"," Go ahead, Tesla load up."
"4091180","4092140"," Yeah, there are now what?"
"4092760","4095939"," There are now 40,000 puts on."
"4097020","4101680"," Now, I think, like you said, and I'm looking at it right now, there are 40,000 puts on 437"
"4101680","4103300"," P."
"4105020","4106020"," Good eyes, Winkie. "
"4106060","4106760"," I wasn't paying attention."
"4106779","4107540"," I wasn't looking at those."
"4108279","4117080"," I've got some Wednesday and Friday at 430s for April 20th and April 22nd. "
"4119160","4122399"," There's 60 cents and 13 cents on the puts."
"4124439","4126899"," And then I might buy some more calls again."
"4127000","4128200"," I might buy another rec calls here. "
"4130740","4133880"," I'm going to be looking at the 445s for a dollar."
"4138800","4140220"," I think I can get them down to a dollar."
"4156180","4159000"," I'll just some sellers step in quickly here on the spy. "
"4159359","4171600"," We're a little bit of rejection right where my cursor is right now, 442.50. Yeah,"
"4171680","4176939"," I've got, I've got a, I'm loading, I'm loading puts for Wednesday and Friday as we trade higher."
"4178160","4184800"," So I'm buying calls too, but so let's look closer here or a little bit closer here."
"4185899","4186640"," And tighter. "
"4189819","4190680"," Right here."
"4192220","4194040"," One, two, and three."
"4194960","4203540"," So that if we do trade higher and catch this role here and at the same time looking for this"
"4203540","4206280"," to of course trade up, so now I'm protected. "
"4207020","4211420"," And if we do trade higher, if we do try to tag this, if we do try to tag this"
"4211420","4218400"," 445, 446 zone, if we try to tag this here, I'm going to keep buying some day trade calls."
"4219820","4221480"," And I'm looking for some kind of a move."
"4221800","4223340"," I don't know if this takes place today, tomorrow. "
"4224280","4225340"," However, it happens even right now."
"4226060","4229740"," We do, we do know we've got some fed speakers coming up at 12 PM."
"4229960","4233440"," So I'm going to assume that that's going to be the instigator of negative. "
"4234980","4240760"," They're right at this fed speaker negativity in the market."
"4253640","4261580"," I have to kind of the same strike or adjust your strike."
"4262040","4263480"," So that's a good question, Doug. "
"4263800","4268460"," It depends on, do I sometimes do switch strikes?"
"4269620","4270640"," It becomes more apparent."
"4271220","4277920"," It becomes more apparent if, you know, some, you know, some days we move 34, you know, some days we"
"4277920","4282020"," move 30 points, is the norm for depends on the implied move for the day."
"4282700","4285520"," Some days we have an implied move of we're going to move 150 points. "
"4286380","4293880"," So I do sometimes get caught where I have to actually sell and shift into a better strike."
"4294680","4299140"," But if the implied move is small enough, it's not usually that much of a difference."
"4299720","4304720"," Or not always, you don't always have to change strike. "
"4305460","4307860"," Then I also add different dates as well."
"4308460","4312340"," So I'll try to spread them out over the course of the next one to two strikes."
"4313620","4315020"," Because I still think we can trade up here. "
"4315140","4318480"," I don't see why we can't trade up from here."
"4318580","4321340"," I'm not overly negative on where we are currently."
"4325450","4327830"," Although there's a shit ton of puts being bought right now. "
"4329390","4330250"," So I think you hold."
"4330490","4331310"," I think that you add it."
"4331410","4336430"," I think you add puts here from here up to I think you add puts here. "
"4336950","4345210"," And the question becomes how low will it trade between now and let's say this is Wednesday expiry"
"4345210","4345770"," here, right?"
"4345770","4347930"," And this is Friday over here, the 22nd."
"4348470","4351010"," Do I think we'll come back down and print some puts over here?"
"4351090","4351510"," Yeah, definitely."
"4352350","4353410"," Like 90% chance. "
"4354350","4360330"," And do I think we can trade higher and out of this trading area here?"
"4361090","4362910"," Normally, it's not going to remember this this morning."
"4363090","4363710"," And normally we would."
"4363870","4372750"," Normally you would see us due to the 25 deltas in the increased premium and call deltas that we"
"4372750","4375030"," would squeeze up and out of here. "
"4376590","4379930"," But their point was that they believe there's complex trades that won't allow us."
"4380610","4382210"," It's not retail doing it."
"4382230","4384210"," It's large bags doing it. "
"4384450","4388750"," So we'll get Tesla here at this resistance above at 10, 25, 10, 30."
"4389450","4396730"," We see some resistance above and we see also some more or the big resistance here is 10, 50 on"
"4396730","4397170"," Tesla."
"4400080","4401140"," But I am bullish on Tesla. "
"4402140","4403700"," I want to see Tesla trade."
"4403700","4407180"," I want to, I think Tesla can trade, I'll bring this up now."
"4407440","4417200"," So I want to say that Tesla can trade higher in here and then get the spook on their, everybody"
"4417200","4419560"," gets spooked out and sell into their ER. "
"4420540","4422960"," But I do like Tesla down here."
"4424380","4426180"," I thought we'd get weakness right off the bell."
"4426520","4430260"," At some point or at least here, I thought we'd get some weakness and then sell down and I could"
"4430260","4430720"," buy a dip. "
"4430720","4432960"," I missed this buy down below here this morning."
"4433400","4435240"," I wish I had bought it now, but that's okay."
"4435620","4438180"," We'll take this, we'll take the short side of this trade at some point. "
"4438400","4442300"," Oh, I don't actually trade Tesla short, but we'll take it short and spy."
"4444100","4445240"," So that's becomes a question."
"4445500","4446620"," How high can I trade here?"
"4447420","4448160"," I'd say it's easy. "
"4448780","4452680"," I think before their earnings that it's easy to get to 10, 50."
"4452860","4457620"," I think this is a reasonable, a reasonable trade."
"4458580","4462280"," We know that a majority of sellers are above here at 1100. "
"4463460","4464780"," So can we trade to 1100?"
"4465400","4467120"," Yeah, Tesla could do anything, right?"
"4467920","4470160"," Can Tesla trade to 1100 before ER?"
"4472680","4473420"," Tough call."
"4475000","4477940"," I'm going to go with, I'm going to go with 10, 50."
"4479820","4480780"," Let's take a look closer. "
"4483240","4484020"," Tough call."
"4485080","4486920"," I'm going to go with 10, 50, right?"
"4487620","4497420"," I'm going to give a caveat that if we trade to 1100, eight time before other"
"4497420","4501440"," earnings, I think people take their profit, no matter what."
"4501660","4503380"," I think they'll be profit taking above at 1100. "
"4504420","4508460"," So it's possible that you can trade to, from here, put 70 points on the board."
"4509120","4509880"," I think it's possible."
"4511500","4515460"," I'd give it like a 45 to a 60% chance of happening, but if it did go that high,"
"4515460","4519560"," I don't think it leaves much room for other earnings report. "
"4520900","4524360"," I think that's like the Selva news kind of an event, if it trades up there."
"4525100","4528140"," And of course down here is the buy the dip at 990 on Tesla."
"4543720","4546020"," So you'll look at buy here might buy some more calls. "
"4582640","4592500"," Some buyers stepping in down below here at 441.73, some sellers above"
"4592500","4602520"," at 443.20, volatility right up to 445, 10, 445,"
"4602960","4605280"," 20, and some more sellers above."
"4605740","4610960"," Sellers a week though, here you can see sellers a week until 446 or so."
"4622240","4625380"," So you can see if we can trade up to 445, 446 or so. "
"4639440","4645460"," I'd like to see if this comes into play this 444174."
"4650710","4652150"," If we even get the chance to buy that."
"4661770","4666710"," Calls on Lucid, April 29th, 22.5c for $231,000. "
"4668730","4671870"," Hi, I'll go score calls on VTNR."
"4673330","4678770"," May 20th, 10c, $97,000, some really weird strikes coming out here."
"4678770","4687010"," LABU, April 29th, 12c, $160,000, a bid on pins. "
"4689530","4691550"," FIVN has a bid on it as well."
"4692310","4701330"," Pins May 20th, 26.5c and then May 20th on a f- Can't see shit right now."
"4702350","4709600"," I don't know if it's the way my screen is caught. "
"4709600","4718320"," It is FIVN, May 20th, 125c, $278,000 and Vidia still with a bid on it."
"4719840","4723860"," Uber and NVIDIA and the queues as well."
"4740030","4742450"," I'm literally paying for all these puts right now with calls. "
"4745440","4748600"," Basically, I'm paying for all my puts with calls right now."
"4753180","4756200"," I've got a bunch of free puts with buying calls at the same time."
"4763090","4766150"," I just pay with that last little rip right there. "
"4766250","4769330"," I just sold a bunch of calls that paid for all my puts."
"4771110","4772930"," The last little rip that we just had."
"4775050","4780470"," I sold them for $1.32, $4.44, just a pinch strike above here. "
"4780770","4784710"," Go just below this $4.43. On the spy."
"4786150","4791030"," So we'll look to see if I can buy another rip or here."
"4793410","4795530"," It's all the puts that I've bought are now free. "
"4797550","4798610"," That makes me feel good."
"4805880","4809820"," Let's see if we can get to $4.45 or $4.43 right here."
"4809960","4810180"," What's this?"
"4810460","4817160"," $4.43. More calls in NVIDIA. "
"4819880","4823300"," And the boat is being loaded on cheap puts right now."
"4828250","4835530"," And I'm roughly at the same price that the puts haven't moved as much as the calls have in value"
"4835530","4835970"," down."
"4841980","4845660"," Now $4.44 is now for $1.65. Maybe I sold them. "
"4845820","4846520"," I don't know what I sold them."
"4846640","4852020"," I thought I sold them at $1.32. Let me look at my activity."
"4858460","4872230"," Trade $1.62. Hey"
"4872230","4872410"," buddy. "
"4874630","4876510"," Are you handsome?"
"4881670","4883850"," Call premium is just blasting off right now."
"4884810","4891690"," $4.44 is now $1.72. Straight blasting off."
"4891710","4893990"," Call premium is just jacking right now. "
"4901100","4910560"," Retesting the highs at $4.42.87. I think we crank it right to $4.45. Looks like that's where"
"4910560","4911420"," the sellers are, right?"
"4911600","4920260"," If we scroll above here $4.45.09 and $4.46. Let's see if we can trade higher here."
"4971010","4972570"," Yeah, we blasted right through."
"4972570","4981070"," We blasted right through $4.40. Is what Spock Emma had said this morning was that the drive to $4 "
"4981070","4987630",".40 is, or what they think is, it's when you sell puts right and you buy calls. "
"4989810","4991310"," Well, outside the money calls."
"4992110","4996210"," And so the drive higher is being fueled by these banks, but that retail's not involved in this."
"4996210","5001270"," So you're not seeing this huge rally that you would see to like, you know, $4.60 or something in"
"5001270","5001730"," one day. "
"5002010","5004890"," We're actually trading at the upper bound right now too."
"5005390","5011090"," We're at 1.11%. This is the implied move from Spock Emma today."
"5011210","5013530"," A full move of, I believe it was one point. "
"5014710","5019430"," Let me take a look and see what the implied move was today."
"5025860","5032740"," Yeah, the implied move today is 1.19%. We're at 1.14% currently."
"5035180","5036540"," No, I'll show you this right here. "
"5036920","5044240"," So at 1.12%, it's 1.19% we're getting pretty close to the implied move for the day."
"5060850","5067650"," Yeah, let's see the seller."
"5067810","5069050"," I don't see many sellers here. "
"5069050","5075070"," I see sellers at 4.45% and then 4.46%, right?"
"5075290","5077310"," You can see them here and here."
"5079690","5081970"," But the volatility has gone away."
"5082190","5085170"," You can see there's less volatility in here, less sellers. "
"5085490","5088450"," There's some sellers here, 4.4, 3, 7, 4."
"5090250","5095930"," You can see that everybody's loading up on puts by the heroin indicator going down, just waiting"
"5095930","5096730"," for the next pump."
"5098250","5099970"," Some put buyers stepping in here too."
"5100570","5101890"," Now we'll take a look at it right now. "
"5104050","5106870"," So this is my second spot to buy puts."
"5107110","5108790"," It's right up and right where we are right now."
"5109250","5114750"," You know, 1 down here, 2 and then 3 would be somewhere in this zone. "
"5114890","5121450"," I'll pair this 4.45, 4.46. As the question becomes, do you buy every time you see one of"
"5121450","5123610"," these taps, right?"
"5123770","5125470"," It's some consolidation, so we'll look closer."
"5128560","5143220"," If you see some kind of a consolidation here, we'll"
"5143220","5151380"," look for some more consolidation by another face ripper and see if we can get this up to 4.45,"
"5151580","5153480"," 4.46 before a roll."
"5154140","5154880"," Four time runs out. "
"5165530","5167070"," Yeah, good to see you guys this one."
"5167150","5167570"," How y'all doing?"
"5170460","5173440"," But yeah, Vicks shouldn't be, that's a good question that Winky's bringing up."
"5173620","5174780"," Vicks shouldn't be down. "
"5175100","5176420"," The Vicks can't come down."
"5177380","5184620"," It's not quite backwardation, but the Vicks is not going to come down due to Ukraine, Russia, and"
"5184620","5190180"," FOMC, and OPEX in May."
"5190460","5196240"," So looking towards those known things, you'll still see an elevated Vicks, regardless if we trade"
"5196240","5197000"," higher right now. "
"5200460","5201780"," We'll wait for another pump."
"5208900","5210960"," Yeah, that puts are doing just fine over here."
"5211620","5213220"," So I'm comfortable with hold. "
"5213380","5215480"," I'm holding some puts for Wednesday and for Friday."
"5216200","5218160"," I'm holding 4.30s on both dates."
"5219160","5225500"," And then I'm going to look to buy, and just so you know, there's shit tons of call premium right"
"5225500","5227060"," now on the call side. "
"5228420","5234680"," Even us trading lower at this point right here, there's call premium leaking into the call side."
"5234880","5239020"," So we'll look to see if we can catch another dip to buy to go long here."
"5239860","5245520"," If we do, if, so right now I'm almost flat right now. "
"5246420","5251700"," So if I, if we get one more dip to buy down here, I've got my free call, my free"
"5251700","5255340"," puts that I own, and then I'll just be printing at this point."
"5265080","5266840"," Vicks has been gearing up for a while."
"5268500","5270680"," Listen to Chase's stream. "
"5275100","5275880"," Good morning, Brad."
"5276040","5284870"," How are you going to need to start dumping spa?"
"5285930","5289930"," I feel good with puts up here, but I feel really confident with puts up here."
"5290350","5292070"," I feel fine. "
"5298600","5301360"," Yeah, maybe a good day to cut short legs off of put spreads."
"5305600","5307280"," Yeah, I'm not on any put spreads right now."
"5307400","5308560"," I already cashed those out. "
"5311300","5312740"," The put spreads did very well."
"5312880","5313740"," I was very happy with them."
"5313740","5316960"," And then I yesterday was yesterday was a kick-ass day to trade. "
"5318020","5320680"," So we're watching this right here real quick."
"5320860","5322620"," This is the second one that I'm looking at, right?"
"5322980","5324280"," This is actually a good day to be doing this."
"5324920","5328020"," We have a, we have a day of, you can see it down here, right?"
"5328840","5330220"," The first one, there's the second one. "
"5331000","5335600"," Do you guys ever look at how to, how to trade, uh, trade bullish days when we're trading up high?"
"5336740","5340180"," Really some consolidation, next leg up, next leg up, right?"
"5340340","5343160"," We had one down here, boom move, boom move, right?"
"5343160","5345160"," This one right here, I didn't see this coming."
"5345300","5346660"," I think I traded this for just a minute."
"5347200","5348640"," And then I traded this one right here. "
"5348800","5351660"," So we'll look to see if we can grab another, another push higher here."
"5352620","5354340"," I think, I think we can get there."
"5354480","5355640"," I think we can, I'm not positive. "
"5356400","5359120"," I'm loaded to the tips and puts here to protect."
"5359360","5363760"," But if there's a moment to grab another leg to this 446, I'll grab it."
"5366550","5367730"," I'm going to buy her stepping in currently. "
"5368570","5420570"," Can see him stepping in among some"
"5420570","5421510"," calls again right now."
"5449820","5454980"," Watch the calls on TLT, Apple, XBI, Nvidia, more calls on Nvidia."
"5460510","5462190"," We'll see if this does the trick to get us higher. "
"5471030","5472170"," So we'll take a look at Nvidia next."
"5475230","5478690"," Nvidia gang is definitely given Tesla run for its money."
"5488600","5492500"," Now trading 442.95. We talked about the sellers here at 443. "
"5493340","5496440"," And the next batch of sellers is at 445, 446."
"5496860","5497900"," So you can see them above here."
"5498580","5502740"," 443, 80 has some more sellers stepping in and then 446 above. "
"5535280","5537180"," Yeah, selling puts and buying calls."
"5542520","5543160"," That's where it's at."
"5544960","5546440"," Selling puts buying calls. "
"5579330","5584110"," So I've got one and two for this trade right here higher."
"5585610","5593530"," And I'm going to look for another bump above here, around 443.81. So I'm going to look for"
"5593530","5596450"," a trade like this."
"5597670","5598750"," Another trade like that. "
"5599450","5600590"," Maybe something like that."
"5600950","5602810"," Matter of fact, we'll keep this right here."
"5604820","5609320"," I'll keep a neural deal as I'll do it with something like this. "
"5610800","5612200"," So we'll get this one right here."
"5614300","5615780"," 443.40 or so, right?"
"5617140","5618180"," For another tag above there."
"5620520","5621280"," Something like that. "
"5625260","5627160"," We'll see if that works itself out or not."
"5630720","5633740"," We'll check it at the end of day and see if that actually works."
"5638640","5642720"," Trade and hire now, 443.40. Blast them through the resistance that was here. "
"5644120","5647720"," Next stop for the spy is 445 flat."
"5648700","5655920"," So we'll see if this trade's higher on the day."
"5656180","5657980"," Let's see if there's that nice big push. "
"5659820","5661860"," There was some sellers here at 443."
"5662620","5666560"," 443, I think we called it 78 or 4380 or so."
"5673740","5677300"," More calls coming in on shit stonks on meme stonks. "
"5677380","5683800"," We're watching calls on AMC till Ray for, of course, April 20th for 20."
"5683800","5689120"," Calls on the queues, 42342C."
"5696410","5701370"," If you know what I couldn't read anything is because my screen was all I have one of these on"
"5701370","5705550"," the computer that I will track options flow. "
"5706310","5710230"," I've got one of those screens where it's privacy, you can watch porn and shit."
"5713260","5716280"," Like an airport, no one can see it except for you and the guy standing behind you."
"5718000","5719560"," 445 is not the dollar 50. "
"5719940","5722040"," That's why I've been jumping down on calls."
"5732220","5733580"," What time does that put us that to?"
"5733760","5738020"," That's the other thing too is I think the feds or the fed speakers are at."
"5738460","5740100"," Let's see what time the fed speakers are on. "
"5743100","5753090"," The first fed speaker today is at 12.05 p.m. So let's put a"
"5753090","5756870"," little let's put a little oh shit moment in there."
"5756870","5759610"," It's got 11.45. We'll start doing all those shit."
"5762180","5766000"," So 11 we have basically until 11.45 to trade this hire. "
"5766760","5772700"," Basically have from here to here to get the 4.46 before we get a fed the fed shit."
"5774320","5778980"," So we'll see if we can trade higher into this 4.40 into this 12 o'clock hour before the"
"5778980","5780100"," fed speakers come into play."
"5782940","5793750"," See if we can get up to 4.46. More"
"5793750","5798030"," calls on the spy on QQQ's, CCL getting some calls on it as well. "
"5799510","5821470"," AMC calls on AMC, we'll look at that in video sorry"
"5821470","5823310"," about that trading right now."
"5834300","5836020"," NVIDIA's got clear skies to 225."
"5839100","5842980"," I'm getting in some lag right now. "
"5845580","5846140"," 225."
"5847340","5849100"," 230 would be the price target on NVIDIA."
"5852260","5853900"," Let's see what some dips to buy. "
"5860830","5862230"," 215 on NVIDIA."
"5866540","5867800"," Call buying is huge."
"5869280","5871200"," A little bit of plateau on call buying on NVIDIA. "
"5872260","5875600"," Still watching lots of calls coming for airlines."
"5877160","5880080"," AAL has this coming into May 20th 18c."
"5880440","5881720"," Spy has more call buying. "
"5882260","5884100"," April 20th, 445c."
"5884940","5894880"," April 20th, 443c on the spy smashing fashion trying to"
"5894880","5896600"," get up to this 4.45 above."
"5934720","5935800"," It's really nice right now. "
"5936740","5938420"," I'm making a lot of money right now."
"5939780","5943220"," So every time we trade up here, there's another one."
"5943420","5944080"," There's another one. "
"5947380","5978800"," The price target above 4.45.09. Watch"
"5978800","5988620"," this going back to 9.30. Just look at that hero indicator just straight down over"
"5988620","5994200"," here since 9.30 and just blasting off the VWAP way down below."
"5999930","6001610"," Let's see if we can see any real sellers here."
"6003530","6013050"," Yeah, that's the price target right there, 4.46, 4.45, and 4.46. Use this as an opportunity to"
"6013050","6017170"," make money on the call side and to set yourself up for a move lower. "
"6027630","6028830"," Yeah, you see that winky?"
"6029270","6030670"," Hero indicators like fuck you."
"6032130","6035790"," Everybody's loading the tub that's fueling a rip higher right now."
"6042850","6045170"," It's fueling a rip higher whether you like it or not. "
"6051020","6053260"," It's fueling a monster move higher to 4."
"6053640","6061380"," And you got to think that I'm not the only one that knows that that this 4.45 is a"
"6061380","6062160"," price target up here."
"6079050","6080670"," So you got some resistance here."
"6081730","6085870"," See if we can get this next leg higher here or if we're getting a rollover or not. "
"6087790","6091610"," When I want to buy another, I'm going to try to buy another dip in here."
"6097060","6098760"," We'll look for another dip in here to buy."
"6102040","6103460"," I'm going to grab another dip. "
"6123560","6125420"," I'm going to sell this ticket in right now."
"6130590","6133550"," Just watch some major hedging come into IWM."
"6134470","6144350"," May 20th, 192 P for 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9,"
"6144930","6151450"," $9 million in May 20th, 192 P on IWM. "
"6154330","6155190"," More hedging."
"6155290","6157990"," We saw the same hedging flow come in yesterday in IWM as well."
"6161250","6163130"," Let's see if we can buy a dip here. "
"6176020","6177380"," Still watching it now."
"6178880","6180660"," See if we can grab a dip here."
"6184420","6186500"," Get a little bit closer so I can see. "
"6197320","6198880"," Let's see another dip."
"6200600","6211820"," It's 4.43. Some"
"6211820","6213080"," buyers stepping in right now."
"6249580","6256970"," Are we finally going to roll over a bit?"
"6257110","6257390"," I don't know. "
"6257590","6259530"," I'm going to be trying to buy a dip here."
"6259930","6260910"," I'm still looking to buy."
"6262270","6264870"," I'm looking to buy something in here. "
"6267260","6268480"," So yeah, let's move here."
"6269360","6273860"," I still think we can tag this 445 and 446."
"6275340","6278900"," So I'm going to look for a next minute or two to buy something down here. "
"6279440","6283000"," I can get a quick little, be nice to get a little leg."
"6284360","6284960"," Then I move higher."
"6288280","6294200"," I'm going to say there's some weakness from the quit buying on the IWM. "
"6320520","6323280"," Let's see if there's any more buyers down here or not."
"6323800","6324200"," Let's take a look."
"6325500","6331860"," There are buyers previously down here at 443.10. We have a mark here. "
"6332200","6333940"," These buyers don't show up here."
"6335220","6336020"," Could be a nice trick."
"6336300","6337240"," Could be a nice trade lower. "
"6340870","6348460"," If this 443.10 doesn't hold, V-Wops down below it."
"6348680","6355900"," 440.76. So you need buyers to step in right where we are right now."
"6356420","6358160"," Right around 443.10 or so. "
"6358740","6361560"," If no buyers step in, wait a minute, come on here."
"6364040","6373040"," If no buyers step in, your next stop is going to be 441.70. Yeah, 441.70. If no buyers"
"6373040","6376460"," step in right here, 4170 price target."
"6389780","6391600"," So we'll see if the buyers step in or not. "
"6411150","6412390"," This is it, fair party."
"6413130","6413690"," Never come back."
"6414850","6425860"," Huge sell-off 443.35ish. There aren't any buyers anywhere in the chain until 440.70. You"
"6425860","6427780"," can see this is one note right here. "
"6427920","6431920"," You see these take note of these sellers stepping in above here."
"6432740","6434920"," They're stepping in right now right above here."
"6438180","6440260"," See if they can size this up a little bit. "
"6441080","6448070"," See these sellers stepping in above here at 443.40. This is what happened yesterday."
"6464050","6465050"," Let's see if we can get some roll."
"6471460","6472540"," See this mark here?"
"6472880","6474500"," See, this is what this is right here. "
"6475020","6479580"," If you guys see where my cursor is right here, this already had a seller stepping yesterday was the"
"6479580","6480020"," same way."
"6480140","6482580"," They weren't there and then all of a sudden they showed up."
"6483340","6493160"," So we'll see if we can get some weakness down to 441.70 right down in this zone down here. "
"6495680","6500500"," We have VWAP down below here at 44081."
"6501740","6503600"," Some dip buyers down below 445."
"6517940","6519060"," Same chart here. "
"6519720","6520500"," Bought some puts here."
"6520640","6521380"," Bought some puts here."
"6521760","6527600"," And if we get up to three up here, this is when I'm going to get heavy on puts. "
"6529460","6531520"," Somewhere in this rolling over."
"6536760","6539640"," If we can trade this, trade this higher to 446."
"6541280","6542980"," And we'll see if we can get up here. "
"6543640","6545740"," This would be first and this would be second right here."
"6546680","6547580"," For this wave over."
"6561360","6565760"," This is where you'll know too if these sellers disappear again and we start trading higher here,"
"6566440","6568380"," you'll know that we're trading up to. "
"6568680","6574100"," If we get rejection right here at 443, you'll know that we're going to roll it over."
"6575500","6578180"," If we don't get rejection here, we start continuing to trade higher."
"6578180","6581640"," You can take along above 44346. "
"6597130","6597910"," How's everybody doing?"
"6600570","6601470"," What about 435?"
"6601650","6602590"," I want that or 430."
"6602890","6603910"," Oh, that's just disappeared out."
"6604010","6604730"," Yeah, you see that winky?"
"6604970","6606830"," See these fucking, see how it was here?"
"6607670","6610710"," Like they come in at the market and then they leave the market. "
"6610970","6612470"," It's like they were just there to play ping pong."
"6616170","6621070"," So we'll see if these sellers are still here or if the buyers step back in and bring it higher."
"6621820","6627870"," If we get above 44345 or so, I'll take another one here. "
"6633630","6641550"," Watching calls come in on AMC, Amazon and IWM."
"6642590","6651210"," Watching AMC calls, Amazon, April 29th, 3180C, $723,000."
"6652980","6655470"," Some more spy put by, which seems rational. "
"6658590","6661250"," Let's see some butt dip buyers still stepping in down here."
"6661370","6665330"," See down below, some dip buyers, dip buyers, and dip buyers once again."
"6666350","6667410"," And see them down below. "
"6667750","6670270"," More buyers down below here, 44269."
"6672570","6673930"," We'll see if we head down there."
"6680600","6681900"," You know, print me some puts, baby. "
"6683380","6684780"," Selling, selling, selling."
"6737800","6740360"," Watching my puts now to see if they're going to start fucking printing."
"6745680","6747600"," Let me get back to what we're doing here. "
"6751500","6752260"," Guess the second here."
"6761490","6763210"," See they just pop right in right here."
"6764050","6765910"," Let's see how low we can go if we can. "
"6775330","6776590"," Just sitting in puts right now."
"6779530","6781210"," Let's see if we can get this rule over going."
"6784350","6791790"," Also watching QQQQQS, $429,352C for $3.8 million. "
"6796330","6817700"," Huge buy on the QQS, $3.8 million, $429, 352C, 13,760 contracts at $2.76. Doing"
"6817700","6819960"," well to cut to cut to Kishia, how are you?"
"6822300","6823700"," I've been speaking at 1105."
"6823840","6826760"," I think the speaker's at 1205, right?"
"6855180","6856840"," I'm getting ready to buy some cheap calls here."
"6865100","6867800"," Let's see if we can buy this dip right here. "
"6869620","6879510"," I can go over HYG with"
"6879510","6885120"," you before he is where the next buyer is."
"6885780","6887980"," I have your calls after Fed Speaker."
"6890560","6896680"," If you see here, that Q's buying is going to make us go up a little bit here. "
"6907660","6909580"," Big buys on Q's."
"6926570","6932510"," What I did was I did start coding the over the weekend I did some work on coding in Python."
"6933910","6942330"," I want to check with Sergio first and see if he minds if I put his code into Python. "
"6942950","6945490"," I don't want to just use his code and not ask him."
"6945670","6948130"," I have to take a minute and get on Twitter and ask him if he minds."
"6949010","6952450"," If I use his code for a Python script. "
"6953150","6958910"," I want to use other people's stuff without worries because he might get pissed off."
"6960250","6962950"," I have to send him a DM."
"6963170","6963790"," I haven't done it yet. "
"6964990","6966950"," Send him a DM and ask him nicely."
"6980290","6981450"," Spy catching a bid once more."
"6988190","6991130"," It's like I'm patiently waiting for $4.44 to buy a put spread. "
"6995090","6998310"," According to trading economics calendar Evans at $1,105."
"7000630","7002690"," I guess we should check that."
"7007430","7009590"," I've always talked New York time. "
"7016740","7019940"," They still use the New York clock."
"7020560","7021440"," I had two clocks."
"7022580","7024400"," One for Eastern Standard Time. "
"7024920","7027120"," I slept on the Eastern Standard Time schedule."
"7028320","7031180"," I never fucked up my time schedule."
"7041830","7042990"," It's open source. "
"7043490","7047450"," He says it's fine for you to use it."
"7049150","7050830"," But I don't know if it's fine."
"7051390","7052450"," Just be careful up in here. "
"7052590","7059270"," I want you guys to be aware that you see these semic cursors where these sellers come in."
"7060130","7061590"," It's like the hand of God or something."
"7061990","7063730"," They just poke themselves in. "
"7066090","7068390"," We'll see if those sellers still come in."
"7068510","7073010"," If we get above $4.43.45, I'll pick up another long here."
"7073490","7074850"," I don't want to get a rejection here. "
"7074850","7079590"," I'm going to wait a few minutes here and see if we can get above this $4.41 here."
"7080530","7082530"," I'm still not grabbing a long here yet."
"7082590","7083610"," I want to make sure we're above it. "
"7084130","7085530"," Make sure they don't sneak in."
"7089340","7095360"," Right here is where I'm looking to see if they start selling again."
"7102950","7109550"," He allows anyone to use the code, but he hasn't expressly said, hey, you can use it on your"
"7109550","7109870"," channel. "
"7110030","7115870"," I want to go and use something that somebody else has developed and then make a video about it"
"7115870","7119110"," without asking them."
"7119410","7120730"," It's just the proper thing to do."
"7122900","7139670"," Now trading higher at $4.43.51, breaking past these sellers above here at $4.43.40. Call"
"7139670","7141490"," is coming in now on misfit. "
"7143130","7146450"," April 29, 290C for $500,000."
"7146630","7149210"," Call is on BAC, WBA, and NVIDIA."
"7168570","7169910"," It's just still inputs here. "
"7173260","7181860"," Broken past, you can see these sellers that were here, weak sellers, down at $4.43.31. Bull's still"
"7181860","7182900"," in control at this point."
"7202160","7213960"," Price target still above $4.45. $4.45.92. Breaking"
"7213960","7214880"," through levels here."
"7224530","7225770"," I think it starts the role. "
"7225910","7229030"," I think the moment you get the Fed Speaker on at $12, that's when you'll start to see the role"
"7229030","7229490"," in the market."
"7231900","7232960"," We've got another hour."
"7234000","7237180"," Let's give it like 45 minutes of either side. "
"7237460","7242720"," What we could do here too is we could sell into strength here."
"7243280","7245820"," You've got 45 minutes left until 12 o'clock."
"7246880","7249360"," What you could end up having is the distribution pattern. "
"7249700","7256240"," We distribute from now into the 12 o'clock hour when the Fed Speaker speaks right."
"7257060","7261480"," You're buying calls, buying calls, and the call holders are selling into you."
"7262100","7269880"," Then you see the actual rollover once we get into the $11.45 or $12.05 or so once the"
"7269880","7271220"," speaker comes out and starts talking. "
"7272960","7274940"," It's just distribution now at this point."
"7274940","7275540"," It looks like distribution."
"7275980","7276340"," I could be wrong. "
"7277320","7284720"," My positive is that we trade up to my positive is that we trade up to $4.45. You make"
"7284720","7290440"," that squeeze higher to $4.45. $4.46. But this action right here is looking more like distribution,"
"7290980","7291080"," right?"
"7291900","7297920"," So you're riding calls up here and you sell into that strength, right?"
"7298400","7300340"," Then it drives back up, right?"
"7300600","7303940"," But then they cut them loose again, cut them loose and then eventually just rolls over."
"7305840","7308740"," As we head into the 12 o'clock hour, $12.05 or whatever."
"7309920","7311320"," But I still think we get here. "
"7311520","7316920"," I think even if it's a squeeze of some kind, I still think that this is on the table."
"7318620","7320180"," This is the top I think though."
"7321400","7326940"," Unless there's some news we don't know or unless a Fed Speaker comes out and says when I heard the"
"7326940","7329400"," retail investor, it's more like distribution here. "
"7329660","7331140"," It's not looking like it'll go up higher."
"7331500","7333600"," It does look like distribution, right?"
"7334400","7336260"," It's like we're going higher."
"7336460","7336960"," We're going higher. "
"7338020","7342820"," But in fact, it's just handing off bags to bulls that are late to the trade."
"7346520","7348780"," And we are at a one point just a note."
"7349100","7357160"," We are up to an implied move today of 1.19% and we're trading already at 1.23%. So"
"7357160","7360480"," this would be upper, upper bounds of where we can get today more than likely. "
"7365280","7367320"," So I'm sitting on some puts."
"7368340","7371820"," I will add two puts if we get up to 445, 446."
"7373520","7375940"," And otherwise, I'm just going to hold at this point. "
"7376220","7377760"," I'm not going to buy any more calls here."
"7378340","7380960"," I'm not trying to squeeze the last little bit out of the market."
"7381440","7384560"," So you can see where it is above here. "
"7385360","7387520"," You can see these sellers above here."
"7389320","7391540"," 446, 445, 30."
"7392220","7396920"," So even if it trades up here, I'll just be adding to puts above at 445, 446. "
"7440010","7441150"," It's where we just bounced."
"7441510","7442990"," So TLT just bounced off 118."
"7444170","7448970"," I think I gave a, I hope the guy I could buy like 116 is where I want to buy"
"7448970","7449530"," TLT. "
"7451710","7454150"," We're close to where I want to buy TLT."
"7504840","7506060"," Yeah, it's real close."
"7506700","7516680"," Talked on Twitter about like a, talked on Twitter about this move right"
"7516680","7517000"," here. "
"7519570","7524010"," Talked on Twitter about this move right here taking place."
"7525190","7529070"," I think we were, I think it was back in, I think it was trading."
"7530550","7533070"," I think it's just trading right in here. "
"7533990","7537970"," And I had mentioned that you would see a capitulation move down."
"7538210","7539450"," I think I even drew it just like this."
"7541050","7547370"," As like you're looking for a, for a capitulation move down and you're seeing it unfold right now"
"7547370","7550050"," with these moves lower. "
"7551190","7554370"," And the volume you can see all these sellers down here, right?"
"7554370","7563820"," And you really want to see these last bulls get out before these, these last bulls in"
"7563820","7564540"," TLT."
"7565400","7571960"," And what's, what's significant about this is down in here, this like 116."
"7572240","7574100"," This, this zone right here is important. "
"7575520","7576200"," Oh yeah, see."
"7578540","7581480"," I think I've made these marks in the past over here."
"7582040","7587340"," So like, so when you're, when you're seeing like, like this area right here, right?"
"7587460","7588700"," This is an area of accumulation. "
"7589480","7591940"," And then this push higher right here, right?"
"7592360","7594040"," And this bottom down below here, 105."
"7595460","7597260"," 116 to 105 area."
"7597420","7602360"," And this is back in, what is this?"
"7603060","7604500"," I think what I say is 2020, right?"
"7604700","7605480"," It was 2018. "
"7606620","7608920"," You haven't seen lows and lows down there."
"7609040","7610740"," This is 2018 as well."
"7610740","7614060"," And this is back in 2016. "
"7614980","7617780"," So we're getting close, like TLT is getting close."
"7618680","7622700"," I think I said 116 is where I really like it."
"7622760","7623400"," It's at 187. "
"7625300","7634610"," But this is close to an area of, you know, we're starting to get out of this zone down here"
"7634610","7639490"," where this becomes very attractive to buy on TLT."
"7639490","7643050"," This is where like the, this is where the bond bulls feel max pain."
"7643210","7644990"," Like this is all max pain area. "
"7645610","7652410"," Any of this down here is, have been long TLT since 2016, 2018."
"7653650","7656890"," This is long time money that's in bonds."
"7659270","7661110"," So I like anything in here. "
"7661470","7664590"," I like, like, just, just owning anything in here."
"7665410","7670660"," I like, let's look at five here."
"7670740","7670920"," Yeah. "
"7671760","7672500"," Just look at that."
"7675100","7676820"," I like owning, look at that."
"7676920","7677460"," It's destruction. "
"7677920","7681120"," Death and destruction for, I mean, look at how low it went, right?"
"7683620","7687420"," $265 break below for that."
"7688280","7689600"," Just, this is bearish."
"7689940","7691160"," Just whether you know this or not, right?"
"7691280","7692760"," This is pretty fucking bearish right here. "
"7694640","7696220"," So do I think you get to 105?"
"7696440","7701400"," Probably, probably a relief value of some kind, but I think it's somewhere down in here."
"7701840","7703540"," It's going all the way back to 2015."
"7705600","7706800"," It's pretty wild, right?"
"7707940","7712200"," Figure, figure all this down here was bought this whole zone, right?"
"7712360","7715520"," This was pushed up into this zone right here. "
"7719730","7723790"," Get a bunch of carryover from, bunch of carryover from other stuff."
"7725470","7727350"," Like this whole area right here."
"7727770","7729250"," It's whole trade right here. "
"7731290","7734470"," All right, this is all bank accumulation for this leg higher to 175."
"7735750","7736370"," Down to 100."
"7736930","7739210"," Took the money and ran right, almost 100% profit. "
"7740090","7741990"," And now they've come back down to sell it all."
"7743110","7746770"," All these banks are selling out now and they're looking for a place down here to buy again."
"7747790","7750430"," So if they were buying these dips down here, right?"
"7752610","7755650"," They're probably, we could probably go down to 105. "
"7756150","7756570"," It's possible."
"7757090","7763510"," So anything down here is going to be just squeezing down to dump, right?"
"7763630","7767270"," We're just going to heavily dump all this for the next trip for TLT."
"7769510","7771030"," So I'm still not long TLT. "
"7774490","7776870"," Nice bounce down here, 118, I like that bounce."
"7777710","7780450"," And I also like 116 and I also like 105."
"7785450","7787390"," Watching some distribution on the spy. "
"7791720","7793380"," Some sideways action, right?"
"7794980","7802400"," Sideways action and then a rollover heading into more sellers right here and more sellers right"
"7802400","7802680"," here."
"7803600","7805780"," And we'll see this start to roll over here soon and hopefully."
"7820240","7821560"," We'll bring this back here. "
"7824860","7826260"," Consistent sellers up above."
"7831010","7843710"," Vwabs 4.41.86. Not"
"7843710","7844690"," a lot of buyers down below."
"7844950","7845430"," How do you see that?"
"7847940","7848340"," Some. "
"7848680","7850000"," There's some right here at Vwap."
"7850240","7853460"," This is 4.4.119. Keep note of this."
"7854360","7860820"," You can see them right here, 4.41. Might not be as weak as it looks. "
"7861080","7863960"," I mean, it doesn't look, it looks weak in one respect, it looks weak."
"7865960","7870360"," There's a shit ton of buyers down here for the spy at 4.41. Here's a fuck ton."
"7875190","7881190"," 4.1028. Unless there's a rug pull down here that we don't know about, which is possible. "
"7882830","7888510"," I'm going to look though to see how much money that puts print heading down to 4.41 and see"
"7888510","7893290"," if they do or don't pull the rug down here or not."
"7902380","7911360"," For sellers are above 4.45.09. And some more up here at 4.46. We'll see if we can"
"7911360","7917120"," tag 4.41. 4.101. It's back here too."
"7919620","7923220"," 440.06.440. So there's original buyers. "
"7932460","7934760"," I'll take a quick break and I'll be back."
"7935080","7941080"," It's 11.20. I'm going to take a quick break and I'll be back here in about 10 or 15"
"7941080","7941440"," minutes."
"7942080","7944840"," This trade, we could trade higher here. "
"7944940","7945860"," I want to talk to you about something."
"7947040","7948160"," Just be careful."
"7948160","7952000"," I don't know why the Carnard break book is still sitting up there. "
"7952560","7954560"," So just be careful if you're bullish here."
"7954940","7960160"," What's good about this when you're seeing something like this, a bull will look at this and say,"
"7960960","7964040"," this is just consolidation for a move higher."
"7964300","7971880"," I'm not anti spy going up and tagging this 4.45 and 4.46. But I also, whenever you see"
"7971880","7973860"," a move like this, you see how high this went. "
"7976480","7978840"," Typically, this is distribution and a move like this."
"7979200","7980660"," You'll end up seeing a rollover."
"7982460","7983540"," And this makes sense. "
"7983880","7986900"," You can kind of see it rolling over at some point."
"7989420","7996040"," I think it's risky to take this trade here."
"7996460","7996880"," You can. "
"7997240","7997820"," I just think it's risky."
"7998900","8003580"," I think at some point it becomes back holding as a bull."
"8005940","8007740"," So if I, I'm going to take a quick break. "
"8008060","8015280"," If I see any more, if I see any more rips to this upside here, I'll grab."
"8015520","8018280"," I'm going to add to my put puts for Wednesday and Friday."
"8020360","8022620"," Just don't get caught in this variable because you can get caught. "
"8022840","8024220"," This can get nasty quick."
"8042220","8045600"," I'm watching more calls coming in on some unusual tickers and ease."
"8046260","8047740"," Any GC, I think. "
"8049300","8051280"," I don't know half these tickers."
"8051360","8057420"," I'm like, man, like there's some bids on some really fucking unusual tickers here today."
"8057800","8058400"," Any GG?"
"8058720","8059020"," Oh, it's nag. "
"8059140","8059460"," Is that new?"
"8059620","8066280"," I don't know if that's new egg or not, but nag has calls on it April 22nd, 7.5. See."
"8067510","8068860"," $23,000."
"8071480","8074680"," PSTG May 20th, 33 C."
"8075670","8077200"," $43,000. "
"8077440","8079900"," XOP April 29th, 145 C."
"8080660","8083800"," More calls on plug April 22nd, 27 C."
"8084340","8084720"," TSM."
"8085700","8086600"," Good to see these calls."
"8087100","8088660"," May 20th, 103 C."
"8089510","8090540"," $741,000. "
"8091080","8091920"," More calls on IWM."
"8093180","8094040"," Rasher of calls."
"8094440","8096200"," April 22nd, 203 C."
"8098600","8100560"," Some mixed bag of spy calls. "
"8100880","8107680"," The spy puts a lot of sideways looking calls and a lot of bears and bulls fighting it out in"
"8107680","8108000"," the markets."
"8108360","8113240"," I'm not interested in trading this personally where we are right now."
"8114780","8116220"," I feel like this is the grinder. "
"8116500","8118160"," This is where you get fucked up is in here."
"8119080","8120380"," So I don't want to get fucked up."
"8123280","8131000"," Still have this price target above 445 and 446 and I'll add to my puts if we get up that"
"8131000","8131200"," high. "
"8133040","8134740"," We'll keep this up for you when I take this break."
"8140820","8141760"," Yeah, is that new egg?"
"8142840","8145580"," I haven't traded new egg in fucking a while."
"8146800","8147140"," That's like that. "
"8147480","8151900"," I don't think that stock has been hung along with the last time that stock was hot like four years"
"8151900","8152520"," ago or something."
"8160290","8162190"," I haven't said I'm not watching Tesla before the moment."
"8164790","8166270"," Tesla's retesting 1032. "
"8167070","8168770"," You guys want to see Tesla before taking a break."
"8171090","8176190"," I think you get a price target on Tesla of 1050 and said if it hits 1100 it'll start to"
"8176190","8176430"," sell."
"8180540","8180920"," We'll take a look. "
"8181940","8183180"," Like sell the news kind of event."
"8184600","8190340"," I do like the idea of Tesla, you know, like Tesla bulls will push Tesla higher."
"8191440","8192600"," We'll let that load up. "
"8208840","8210480"," Same two places up here."
"8210600","8216219"," 445, 84, 444 or 445 zero."
"8219440","8220680"," Leave both of these up here. "
"8224040","8225540"," Let's check out Tesla again."
"8226400","8228320"," There's an interesting spy right there."
"8228459","8228500"," Yeah. "
"8228680","8229600"," See, there's that 1050."
"8231240","8233500"," So 1030 or retesting again."
"8234360","8238500"," I think I said by the by the dip was at 990 early. "
"8238600","8239540"," It looks like it's moved up."
"8240020","8241379"," So these are new dip buyers."
"8241680","8243100"," They're higher than they were previously. "
"8243520","8246139"," This is positive for Tesla if you didn't know."
"8246299","8251760"," So you've got dip buyers moving up now to 1000 to want to retest 1050."
"8254740","8258400"," I don't know that we get to 1100 though before earnings. "
"8259180","8264700"," If it did squeeze higher to 1100, you're still looking at the sell the news."
"8264940","8264959"," Right."
"8265059","8268440"," If you guys trade earnings for Tesla, you remember this does happen most. "
"8268740","8273059"," We either we either sell off in earnings or we trade much higher in earnings."
"8273680","8277820"," And then it becomes sell the news typically if we trade higher into ER."
"8279700","8282680"," So do we get to what do we get to 1100 possible?"
"8282680","8284559"," I don't like the idea though. "
"8284799","8294100"," Like the thought process here is like the promise of 1050 kind of looks right with spy getting to"
"8294100","8295400"," 446."
"8296340","8298480"," 445, 446, let's say."
"8299760","8306180"," If Tesla goes to 1100, where would that put the spy?"
"8306180","8309559"," So let's see. "
"8310020","8315660"," It would mean we'd probably break above 446 and then would be your next sell."
"8317959","8319740"," There's a ton of sellers here."
"8320540","8324320"," There's hidden sellers above here at 450, 453. "
"8325059","8327059"," Talked about this number earlier."
"8329340","8334820"," So 450, I'd have to do the math to see if I have to do the math on Tesla going"
"8334820","8337459"," to 1100 and see where that puts us in the spy."
"8341139","8342980"," There's a shit ton of sellers up here. "
"8344639","8345219"," Shit ton."
"8346559","8350700"," Like this 450, get us to 1100 on Tesla is my question."
"8351840","8353000"," And I don't know without doing the math. "
"8354299","8355200"," So I'm going to take a quick break."
"8355360","8363040"," I'll do some if you guys want to do some math in that and see if you can break past"
"8363040","8363740"," 446."
"8370530","8371770"," Where they would put the spy. "
"8376770","8380270"," Because currently it doesn't look like they're betting on that happening."
"8380430","8385250"," It looks like they're betting on the sell coming in at 445, 446."
"8385590","8388970"," I don't think this gets Tesla to 1100. "
"8393330","8395630"," Tesla's moved a little bit independently recently too."
"8395710","8398270"," You could give that argument right Tesla could move on its own without the spy."
"8398270","8404190"," You do know that the spy and the queues can get penned in earnings season even if Tesla goes up. "
"8404830","8405710"," So yeah, I guess so."
"8406010","8406690"," I'll give it to the bulls."
"8406910","8409070"," I'm going to give the I'm going to give the chance to the bulls. "
"8410230","8411730"," That even if they pin the spy."
"8413030","8414490"," You could see 1100."
"8415670","8417010"," Still on Tesla before. "
"8418790","8424850"," Before you are, especially at the expectation is that they're going to have lower profits on."
"8426390","8427970"," Shanghai being shut down right."
"8428730","8431850"," For some not quite bad guidance, but not the best guidance. "
"8432870","8436230"," Or let's just do an uncertainty in guidance."
"8442640","8445580"," Now trading at 443.70 on spy."
"8449500","8450940"," See if we can make that leg up. "
"8451280","8453100"," It'd be interesting if we get up here."
"8453600","8457520"," If the spy does squeeze higher into that 1230 hour, I'm going to laugh my ass off."
"8457520","8463900"," As you can see that it wants to write all this wants to just blast off and just reach up"
"8463900","8465760"," and touch the sky into 12 o'clock. "
"8466220","8470080"," If that happens to be fucking hilarious, I'm not willing to trade this."
"8470720","8471800"," I'm too sketched out by it."
"8481910","8484710"," Oh yeah, small account challenges and we're not there yet. "
"8485890","8491130"," Let me see if I can get on Twitter on that account here."
"8499790","8502710"," That's the login under my line here and I'll get on there."
"8506610","8507670"," It's just a second here. "
"8510850","8512310"," Give me just a second."
"8518200","8519580"," Let's see what account I'm under."
"8522340","8523280"," Just a second here. "
"8529880","8532040"," What did I open that account under?"
"8533040","8540990"," Just a"
"8540990","8548530"," second."
"8619390","8620500"," That's odd."
"8624900","8633760"," Just a second here. "
"8736040","8740860"," Hold on one second."
"8741620","8742300"," I'll write back."
"8742460","8744760"," Give me five minutes a hour. "
"8745000","8745960"," I'm going to be back in ten minutes."
"8746160","8746500"," I'm going to check something."
"8746600","8747340"," I'm going to check something out. "
"8965550","8970010"," If you're still here for a minute, if you're still tuning in right now, if you hadn't signed up for"
"8970010","8976110"," a quick break, I took a look at account constraints and I accepted a bunch of you in."
"8981170","8987550"," So if you were asking about account constraints, I just went through and you guys should all be in"
"8987550","8988050"," just fine."
"8989830","8995510"," We'll see what we'll or the trade has none of the no trade is immediate. "
"8995890","8998810"," So we're waiting for market liquidation events."
"8999290","9001270"," When we get one, I'll place those trades."
"9001370","9004870"," You should get anywhere from nine to twelve trades in a calendar year. "
"9004870","9008250"," For me, they'll just just be those nine to twelve trades there."
"9009110","9011590"," You'll get some kind of a only."
"9011850","9017590"," If you go through the profile, I've made a pen tweet and then I think I may have made one"
"9017590","9024150"," or two other tweets just laying out the rules for the trade with some direction on how to place"
"9024150","9024670"," these trades. "
"9027150","9035050"," You won't get a lot of these trades will only be once every anywhere from a given average of forty"
"9035050","9035690"," five days."
"9036730","9041870"," You'll get one of these trades from me and we're only going to do this challenge over the course of"
"9041870","9042290"," a year."
"9043810","9047950"," Now, I don't recommend that you actually follow me in these trades. "
"9047950","9054990"," I don't think that normally you should even trade or I should even trade a hundred percent trade"
"9054990","9055490"," each time."
"9057250","9058530"," And I don't."
"9058690","9063650"," So I'm doing this as a challenge because I have used this in the past to build an account for"
"9063650","9064370"," more than one account. "
"9064510","9067250"," So I want to say I've done this three times at least."
"9068530","9069930"," And then I use it."
"9070010","9072310"," I use this tool in my regular everyday trading. "
"9073870","9075990"," So it's pretty much what the big banks do."
"9075990","9077250"," It's nothing special."
"9077430","9078130"," It's nothing difficult. "
"9078570","9080650"," But the management of those trades can be a challenge."
"9082770","9086010"," So they can be the challenge and very stressful."
"9086550","9090710"," And then the timing of those trades and then how long you hold those trades and then the"
"9090710","9091130"," discipline. "
"9092010","9099950"," This is the non-gambling side of being an investor, a day trader, knowing what dips to buy, when to"
"9099950","9102210"," buy, went to sell for profit."
"9102210","9108870"," So this trade should take a year to make these."
"9109050","9110310"," It should take roughly a year. "
"9110430","9117710"," Usually you get anywhere from nine to 12 opportunities in a year regardless of where the market is."
"9118730","9120530"," The market could burn off."
"9120850","9123670"," The market could drop just like it did in March 2020. "
"9124730","9126890"," And you'll still find these buying opportunities."
"9128790","9131290"," I checked it all the way back about 30 years."
"9131870","9138070"," There's a few instances where if you don't put enough time on the trade, if you don't put enough"
"9138070","9139710"," time on the trade, they might not print. "
"9140550","9144650"," But it's few, you know, normally I would only go with about 10% of my accounts on one of"
"9144650","9144970"," these trades."
"9146110","9151130"," So you have a consistent win rate of typically have a consistent win rate of about 70 to 90%"
"9151130","9151530"," of the time."
"9152410","9155610"," But every once in a while you can catch 10 good trades. "
"9156410","9163030"," And if I'm conservative in these trades, I think I can make 10 of these with a high chance of"
"9163030","9167750"," hitting every one of them, like 10 straight in a row."
"9169050","9175310"," So if you're a new trader or if you're a broke trader or a new investor or you want to"
"9175310","9179390"," build a bank account or any of those kind of things, this one is for you."
"9179390","9186530"," This is for the person that wants to learn how to make consistent money in the market with a high"
"9186530","9187770"," probability of success. "
"9188890","9192430"," And if you just took trades like this, you wouldn't have to take any other trade."
"9192710","9200390"," The key behind this is if you trade like this or invest like this, that you'll always be a winning"
"9200390","9201590"," investor or trader."
"9202170","9205430"," And trading like this, the market conditions really don't matter. "
"9206170","9208710"," Because eventually the market becomes oversold."
"9209350","9216330"," And when it does that every 30 to 45 days, consistently always has always will."
"9216990","9222310"," Even if we sell the market down to one fell swoop overnight, we have a big bloodbath that the banks"
"9222310","9225510"," do buy this market every single time. "
"9227750","9230350"," So we are coming into 1242, right?"
"9230510","9231530"," We're getting close to that."
"9232270","9236390"," We're getting close to that to this witching hour when the Fed speakers like to come out."
"9238130","9242350"," I guess the only thing anybody could be thinking about would be as if Fed speakers were bullish,"
"9242350","9244410"," but I don't think it really matters. "
"9244570","9246070"," I think there'll be some volatility coming up."
"9246430","9249410"," So I gave you like right around 1145, the runway is running out."
"9249410","9256190"," We'll see if we can squeeze this out to 445, 446 before the Fed speaker start our first Fed speaker"
"9256190","9256730"," comes out. "
"9256830","9257350"," I'm going to put them live."
"9257730","9263670"," I'm going to take one more break real quick from now until 1205 to 1143, take 15, 20 minutes, take"
"9263670","9264130"," a quick break."
"9265050","9268670"," And then we'll tune into the first speaker. "
"9294240","9298380"," I didn't see, I just saw Desperado's comment."
"9299060","9302420"," Yeah, if you're new, I mean, this is for the new, it's not just new traders."
"9302760","9309480"," Like if you're an older trader, but you make you complicate your shit too much, there are easy ways"
"9309480","9315220"," to dumb down the market, dumb down trading, dumb down investing. "
"9316700","9319540"," If you're at a point, matter of fact, if you're at a point where you don't need to day trade"
"9319540","9323280"," or you don't want to day trade or you have a job, I get asked all the time on stream."
"9323780","9327180"," All the time I'm getting asked, people are like, I only want to, I want to trade that I don't"
"9327180","9327840"," have to worry about."
"9328800","9330900"," Or I want to trade, I work all day long. "
"9331000","9333660"," I'm in an office all day long, constantly get asked those questions."
"9334420","9337200"," And this is a traders market right now, not an investors market."
"9337920","9340040"," So this is a good time to do this for these trades. "
"9340860","9342060"," When the market sucks, right?"
"9343400","9349700"," As a matter of fact, if you learn these trades in this market currently, in the market ever does"
"9349700","9357660"," ever become bullish, it'll make it that much easier to know when to buy or the best time to buy"
"9357660","9358460"," a bullish market."
"9359160","9361680"," Because this is a market that's not for bulls, right?"
"9361840","9368200"," So if you're able to still trade like this and make money in an not bullish market, this is going"
"9368200","9372940"," to give you the tools that you need to survive this market and even just a straight bull market."
"9373900","9378120"," When we forget back to having a bull market again, if we ever have that later this year or next"
"9378120","9383880"," year, whatever, this is going to give you the tools that you need to make sure that you stay green"
"9383880","9384520"," all the time. "
"9384600","9385740"," No matter what, you're always green."
"9394700","9395400"," Yeah, no."
"9395940","9397280"," So I'm not buying, I've already bought puts. "
"9397660","9398980"," I'm holding puts right now."
"9399640","9404440"," So I bought calls in the way up and I bought puts that strategic moments, right?"
"9404660","9408320"," So I've got puts for Wednesday and Friday that I bought down here."
"9409120","9410460"," I bought some puts here. "
"9411040","9412180"," I bought some puts here."
"9412760","9417340"," And if we, damn leftover shit, I bought some puts here."
"9417560","9419140"," And while I buy calls, right?"
"9419480","9420280"," Well, I'm buying calls. "
"9421320","9423140"," I'm buying puts at the same time, right?"
"9423680","9426540"," But the calls I'm taking profit off of, right?"
"9426760","9431940"," And I'm holding the puts as a hedge here so far here and here."
"9432940","9436200"," I'm just holding on to them."
"9436200","9438560"," This 445 and 446. "
"9438860","9447940"," I'll add my last round of puts as hedges for an implied rollover either Wednesday or Friday."
"9448380","9449040"," So I'm going to hold these."
"9449620","9453840"," And matter of fact, at this point, I'm slightly up on the day and I have free put. "
"9454060","9455460"," These are, these cost me nothing now."
"9455860","9457260"," These could burn and I don't care."
"9458560","9460500"," Could give two shits if these go to zero. "
"9461200","9462340"," So now what can I do?"
"9462460","9465040"," What can I do as a trader today, right?"
"9465780","9471500"," If we get bullish at any point, I can take those trades higher and I've got protection so that if"
"9471500","9475960"," I burn, if I get fucked up in here at any point, like today, tomorrow, Friday, Wednesday, Thursday,"
"9476020","9479660"," Friday, let's say, let's say I think we're going higher at any point, right?"
"9480480","9486560"," I can take these trades and I don't care because if we start to burn at any point, those puts"
"9486560","9489180"," are going to cover any of those losses."
"9490820","9493300"," I don't know if that makes sense to you guys out there."
"9495300","9500880"," So we are coming into the 11.46. We'll look to see if the market begins to roll over with"
"9500880","9502160"," the Fed Speaker. "
"9502820","9505020"," I think it's Pennsylvania Fed President."
"9505240","9506840"," I don't know exactly what it is right now."
"9508660","9513540"," We'll check again, which little Fed President is. "
"9514300","9515480"," We got two today, right?"
"9515620","9516380"," We got one at eight o'clock."
"9516380","9520740"," And then tomorrow's Wednesday's where the real volatility comes in, right?"
"9521000","9522900"," We got a bunch of fucking speakers tomorrow."
"9523120","9530420"," We got Charles Evans at the Economic Club of New York at 12.05. We've got Neil Kashkari at 8"
"9530420","9533320"," p.m. And then tomorrow we've got existing home sales. "
"9533800","9538020"," We've got Mary of Daley at 10.30 a.m. tomorrow."
"9538260","9540240"," We've got Charles Evans at 11.30 tomorrow."
"9540960","9546960"," We've got Bo Stick at 1 p.m. and we've got the beige book at 2 p.m. from now"
"9546960","9551160"," from like 12 o'clock until 2 p.m. tomorrow. "
"9552080","9557200"," We're going to have what's contrived volatility unless there's some headline news that we don't"
"9557200","9557680"," know about."
"9558780","9560720"," So this is the pump that we get."
"9561780","9564040"," And we've got Netflix coming out tomorrow. "
"9564220","9565660"," No, Netflix is end of day today."
"9566420","9570680"," So there'll be some volatility with Netflix, of course, as well, and to end of day."
"9570680","9574780"," And we also have some, some other big ones coming out too. "
"9575940","9578620"," I was trying to check the AT&T yet."
"9579600","9584620"," Because AT&T had a lot of call buying going on in it yesterday."
"9587680","9590380"," Like a ton of call buying in AT&T. "
"9590760","9596400"," A ton of it keeps moving up, right?"
"9607570","9610450"," Look at that steep sell off an AT&T too."
"9611330","9613410"," Giant gap to fill an AT&T."
"9614530","9616910"," Just shit tons of call buying an AT&T. "
"9617770","9621090"," I was meant to talk, if I came on yesterday, I would have talked about AT&T."
"9621550","9625510"," I wanted to buy this yesterday and I fucking didn't."
"9625830","9628550"," I got thought about it in the morning and then I totally forgot about it all day long. "
"9629190","9631010"," And I wanted to buy some calls on AT&T."
"9634760","9636180"," That's the amount that I didn't."
"9645890","9646730"," I'll be right back. "
"9734360","9736760"," You're listening to Trade the News."
"9740220","9741980"," I forgot to put Trade the News on today."
"9742740","9743960"," The audio is..."
"9744500","9745260"," Alright, we're good. "
"9745960","9746640"," Or it's choppy."
"9747360","9749120"," Please read over our support page at..."
"9752820","9754800"," Yes, we've got Trade the News on now while I'm gone."
"9755060","9756360"," So you guys can listen to Trade the News. "
"9758990","9763770"," Because I'm not finding the economic club of New York is what I'm looking at right now."
"9768080","9771480"," And I'm not seeing anything lined up for..."
"9772420","9780000"," So he speaks at 1 p.m. or 12.05 p.m. I'm not seeing any events for the Economic"
"9780000","9781600"," Club of New York on their homepage."
"9782660","9784300"," Does anybody have a..."
"9800010","9801430"," Does anybody have?"
"9801650","9804110"," So, you know, it's weird as I'm not seeing..."
"9806930","9809570"," I'm not seeing any kind of..."
"9811130","9812710"," Livestream for him speaking. "
"9813470","9814870"," You know, Chase said maybe it's a non-event."
"9816050","9819630"," Chase might be right at being a non-event."
"9820910","9825310"," Because I'm not seeing anything on the Economic Club of New York. "
"9826390","9828450"," Let's check to see if they've got a live stream anywhere."
"9834360","9836320"," I'm looking for..."
"9839610","9841310"," Now I'm on their website."
"9842550","9843430"," It's a luncheon. "
"9844870","9846710"," But there's no live stream on it."
"9851500","9854280"," Maybe you have to be a member to get the information out of there."
"9855940","9856900"," There's a webinar. "
"9862090","9863110"," Oh, here we go."
"9864310","9865630"," Hold on a second here."
"9869330","9870990"," I have to reserve a spot. "
"9873330","9877410"," You're a senior official who goes on to say that they believe Russia have about 75% of their pre "
"9877410","9879850","-invasion combat power currently available."
"9890410","9898050"," Let me see if they let me in."
"9899890","9900690"," Oh, shit. "
"9900990","9903110"," So, it's 75 bucks."
"9903990","9906630"," A webinar ticket is $75."
"9908410","9910230"," I don't know if I want to pay it. "
"9910730","9912050"," I don't know if it's worth listening to them."
"9914810","9919110"," So, you have to pay 75 bucks to listen to this guy talk."
"9922710","9924530"," Here, this is where it is right here. "
"9929010","9938040"," So, the Economic Club of New York to the webinars at 12 o'clock, 12 to 1 pm."
"9942610","9946070"," It says $0.00, but it's $75."
"9946070","9951450"," If you guys want to listen to it, you put your name in, then you put your email in, and"
"9951450","9953970"," then it's $75 to listen into the webinar. "
"9954150","9959270"," Goddamn, it turned $75 to listen to this guy talk at fucking at noon time."
"9959770","9960490"," Fuck it, what a racket."
"9962470","9965570"," These guys are worse than fucking stock bumpers. "
"9966930","9971950"," Now, straight up to $4.44.15. Hello, ladies."
"9975740","9983830"," $4.44.28. We'll see if trade the news has any comments coming out on it."
"9984150","9985370"," I'm not paying 75 bucks. "
"9985510","9987570"," Listen to a little fed speaker."
"9990050","9992690"," See if we can stretch this out so you can see it."
"9995010","10030280"," Same part targets above $4.45.13, $4.45.83. Now,"
"10030300","10035360"," US stocks are moving higher led by pre-market reversals than some of today's key Q1 reporters,"
"10035360","10037720"," namely J&J LMT. "
"10038520","10045340"," WTI crude prices gave back 5% while soft commodity prices also retraced lower treasury yields"
"10045340","10048880"," pushed ever higher following another bout of hawkish fed commentary."
"10049440","10056460"," The US 30 yield is testing 3% for the first time since 2019, while the UK's 10-year guild"
"10056460","10057820"," approach is 2%."
"10057820","10063640"," US stocks have seen a broad-based bid since the opening bell, but volumes have remained modest. "
"10064320","10069600"," Airlines have taken off along with other travel-related names after CDC mask mandates were taken"
"10069600","10071240"," down following a federal court ruling."
"10072100","10076660"," So this is just stuff that's from reading here for this afternoon."
"10076980","10078720"," This came out at 10. "
"10080100","10081220"," So at noon time."
"10082240","10083220"," Also, I got here."
"10090780","10093660"," Some other news that I can see here that's important at the moment. "
"10102160","10103900"," Yeah, the Fed members are set for life."
"10104140","10105280"," Can you believe that?"
"10105400","10111380"," So you figure for a webinar of $75, so if you're a member, you're probably paying probably $5,000"
"10111380","10115600"," to $15,000 for that luncheon, which is insaneo, right?"
"10117380","10119480"," It's probably spent, I would have bet."
"10120180","10124980"," So I have attended events in New York in the past luncheons and birthdays and shit. "
"10125780","10131980"," They tend to be somewhere around like cheap luncheons, like anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000."
"10132760","10139080"," So you figure this guy is probably fucking raking in the fucking cash on just speaking events."
"10139480","10141340"," And this is when they get all hawkish and talk shit. "
"10143120","10144580"," It's a fucking grift."
"10147320","10149740"," Just paying to $4.44, $28."
"10154640","10160980"," Still looking to see if we can get up here as $4.45 or $4.46. I guess it's pretty"
"10160980","10161500"," close, right?"
"10161700","10164820"," $4.44.28 is what?"
"10165240","10167240"," $0.60, $0.70, right?"
"10167440","10173890"," $0.72 away from $4.45. Not too bad. "
"10176820","10178160"," Yeah, you pay for transparency."
"10182960","10185080"," I just watched them by TLT."
"10188760","10190220"," TLT is still cranking right now. "
"10190320","10194760"," They're buying the fuck out of it at $1.18. Buying the fuck out of TLT right now."
"10205980","10208180"," Maybe one of the guys who traded the news will buy the fuck."
"10208380","10209520"," I can't stand it. "
"10209980","10212520"," Like listening to these guys talk, I can't stand listening to them."
"10212520","10218540"," And then to pay $75 for the benefit of listening to them spew bullshit."
"10218920","10219480"," I can't. "
"10219600","10222000"," I can't morally justify it."
"10226500","10227720"," Look at that though, man."
"10227840","10228860"," There's nothing down here. "
"10229020","10229340"," Look at this."
"10229900","10234600"," I mean, this is either huge support up here where we are or this shit's going to be a fucking"
"10234600","10235060"," bloodbath."
"10236540","10237900"," It's going to be a bloodbath. "
"10238340","10238960"," One or the other."
"10240160","10244880"," This right here is this meant this looks like we never come back down here, doesn't it?"
"10256870","10261630"," Well, we're smashing to resistance levels because there are banks that are what they're doing right"
"10261630","10263890"," now is they're selling puts down way down below."
"10264190","10269430"," They're selling 400s, let's say 400 puts, and then they're buying outside the money calls. "
"10270390","10273130"," That's the banks we're doing yesterday and today."
"10289760","10290180"," I'll bring it back."
"10290300","10291440"," I still haven't taken a fucking break. "
"10291620","10292280"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"10294040","10295100"," I'll be right back."
"10698790","10701330"," You're listening to trade the news. "
"10708160","10713220"," Just a heads up that the feds, Evan, he's a dovetan butter."
"10713540","10719200"," He's saying that it's a good reason to think that the economy will do very well even as rates rise."
"10720400","10722800"," The U.S. economy is fundamentally strong. "
"10723100","10728540"," And a minority leader McConnell saying that if Republicans retake the Senate this fall, they will"
"10728540","10730380"," focus on inflation and energy."
"10733480","10737620"," Also note that the market internals update at this point."
"10737800","10741020"," New York Stock Exchange volume is 273 million shares. "
"10741720","10743600"," 8% below its three month average."
"10744220","10746940"," Advanced lead decline is 2.3 to 1."
"10747360","10749820"," NASDAQ volume 2.5 billion shares."
"10750660","10752320"," 4% below its three month average. "
"10752560","10755400"," Advanced lead decline is 2.9 to 1."
"10756020","10761680"," The VIX is down 5% at 20.97. I think now it's down to what's that now?"
"10762480","10764760"," 20.96 currently."
"10767320","10769020"," And what else I've got for you?"
"10769020","10769720"," I think that's what I've got."
"10769900","10777480"," In that Evan's comments, of course, impact U.S.O. T.L.T., the shy BNO. "
"10779640","10784760"," That's Evan saying that we need to be mindful of the wage price spiral and monitor for it."
"10812430","10814910"," No real impact on the shy right now."
"10814910","10818450"," The T.L.T. seemed like the comments had an impact on it. "
"11143040","11147160"," As Evan's saying, look at the composition of inflation, you can take note of some positive"
"11147160","11149040"," developments if they continue."
"11164360","11168820"," Evan's saying it's still too early to think that inflation challenges were facing now are changing,"
"11168960","11169580"," but they could."
"11333560","11338060"," Chairman Chancellor Schulz saying that we will all continue to finance Ukraine militarily and"
"11338060","11338620"," financially. "
"11419300","11424900"," I think some readouts from this teleconference call it took place between Western official Schulz"
"11424900","11428260"," saying the G7 agreed to continue full backing for the Ukraine."
"11432620","11438140"," Chairman Chancellor Schulz saying that their strength of the West is in the unity, and Putin did"
"11438140","11439320"," not expect that."
"11471520","11476820"," As Evan's saying that if we were to do a couple of 50 basis point increases, could get to 2 "
"11476820","11479300",".25 to 2.5% neutral rate by the end of the year. "
"11562950","11567050"," I've been saying that if we don't see inflation coming down, we're going to raise rates above"
"11567050","11567310"," neutral."
"11567310","11581110"," And Evan's"
"11581110","11585010"," saying they do see inflation come down, then neutral rates could be about right."
"11590350","11593930"," So yeah, Evan's is out there massaging up the markets right now. "
"11596300","11597320"," I wonder if it's that."
"11597440","11601480"," Chairman Chancellor Schulz saying that they have reached a limit of what they can deliver from"
"11601480","11604140"," German armed forces owned stocks."
"11607220","11608840"," Let's have a look and see what's going on here. "
"11611780","11613360"," We can tighten any of this up here."
"11659310","11660490"," What do I do here?"
"11661170","11666910"," Let's take it in."
"11667610","11671210"," Evan saying if inflation reaccelerated, that will be a cause of great concern. "
"11674990","11678430"," This last group up here, this is where those last sellers are."
"11679870","11681930"," This is 445, 446."
"11686400","11688460"," Evan's being quite dovish today. "
"11690220","11694060"," This doesn't look exactly like a bear flag, right?"
"11694260","11697920"," It's going to roll over at some point as time passes."
"11698260","11699940"," I guess the question becomes where does it roll to?"
"11700820","11707770"," Or is this just continuation just a grind higher to this sell?"
"11708790","11710890"," We also know that there's a vol trigger up here."
"11710890","11720350"," If you are a bull and you want to get bullish, anything over this, if this 445 holds, that is"
"11720350","11725880"," your volatility trigger for the market. "
"11727100","11730780"," You can see right up here where this zone is going."
"11730960","11735320"," I'm going to say expects that they will need to raise rates above neutral."
"11739800","11741860"," So this is that vol trigger up here at 446. "
"11742320","11745080"," I think Spod Gamma called it at 4500."
"11746020","11752620"," I can look right now and see what it says the vol trigger is for today."
"11752980","11755340"," I haven't looked today yet to see what the vol trigger is. "
"11755520","11756260"," Let me take a look and see."
"11764100","11768280"," The vol trigger is actually lower today."
"11769160","11769620"," Let's show it to you. "
"11769740","11773220"," This is the spy vol trigger."
"11773220","11779620"," The vol trigger is at 442 for today."
"11780060","11780700"," It's even lower. "
"11781940","11782900"," It's not even at."
"11784380","11785960"," I've got it listed at 446."
"11788340","11790380"," This is the volatility trigger right here. "
"11794800","11798640"," We'll change this here."
"11800660","11801880"," That's important to know."
"11802920","11809900"," We'll make this coloring goofy blue. "
"11812130","11813770"," We'll make this kind of look goofy blue."
"11816930","11817630"," Right here."
"11817890","11821150"," To be honest, if this is the volatility trigger, we're past it now. "
"11822490","11826830"," If we have consolidation, if we're able to maintain this, if you're able to maintain this up here,"
"11829890","11832110"," this could signal a move higher."
"11837150","11838130"," Do you remember that?"
"11840110","11841150"," Close that up."
"11849040","11856160"," Evan says expect to see the housing market cool down as rates go higher. "
"11858690","11860270"," Housing market's not coming down for anybody."
"11861130","11861810"," Smoke and crack."
"11863810","11868230"," UK Prime Minister Townsend saying that they'll be giving Ukraine more support with artillery. "
"11871290","11873010"," It's like these sellers up here."
"11873050","11875890"," Right here on Ukraine."
"11877270","11878170"," They're still there. "
"11878310","11881170"," They're still hiding above 445, 446."
"11885520","11888940"," And a raster of sellers up here, 447, 450."
"11895700","11896300"," 453. "
"11901720","11902960"," That's the big boy up there."
"11903200","11903620"," 460."
"11903780","11906640"," This is the retest of the previous high that we had. "
"11909870","11912170"," You know, 460 would get tested at 1100."
"11914330","11916110"," Tesla bounced off that 1030."
"11918250","11926150"," You know, if Tesla went to fucking 1100, you get you get poor 64 shore out of spy. "
"11946330","11949330"," Whatever happened to, well, let's talk about that real quick chase."
"11949710","11951510"," So Chase, where do we buy?"
"11955280","11956560"," Chase, where do we buy puts?"
"11959510","11961330"," Do we buy puts in pier chase?"
"11963150","11964110"," Or we buy puts here?"
"11965350","11966470"," Do we buy puts here?"
"11966950","11967830"," Or we buy puts here?"
"11968430","11969170"," Do we buy puts here?"
"11973770","11975250"," We buy puts here?"
"11975630","11976470"," Or we buy puts here?"
"11977010","11978050"," Does that make sense?"
"11978510","11986240"," So like, let's just say, let's just say that we buy puts here."
"11986800","11987880"," We be kind of fine, right?"
"11988180","11994920"," That once we've set a monthly cap of $95 billion, $95 billion for the run off, we will watch, but"
"11994920","11997300"," not adjusted to manage the policy. "
"11997640","12001860"," Put, put, put, put, put."
"12002120","12005700"," I've been saying the headphones right will continue to be the main tool for monetary policy."
"12006340","12008220"," And calls down there. "
"12008280","12008720"," Does that make sense?"
"12009280","12012700"," Put, calls, puts, calls, puts, calls, puts, calls, puts, puts."
"12013060","12019080"," So, the logic is that you buy puts here."
"12020400","12027880"," Now, if this is the vault trigger being down here right now, the vault trigger is down here though. "
"12028060","12030800"," That's an important thing to note, right?"
"12031880","12032880"," Because we are above the vault trigger."
"12032880","12035820"," Now, this vault trigger was actually higher."
"12036140","12041340"," The vault trigger was up here before we were heading our way down, so the vault trigger changes as"
"12041340","12042340"," calculated each day. "
"12043380","12047920"," Now, if vault trigger is dropped and we're a higher than it, and we're pushing above the vault"
"12047920","12054000"," trigger, we could be looking for consolidation and a move higher and a break above this channel"
"12054000","12054320"," here."
"12056080","12062800"," This is a 445, but we're also looking for some rejection here at 445, 446 to roll back over."
"12063400","12065860"," So, like if you're asking down here, do you buy puts?"
"12066160","12066480"," Fuck no. "
"12067140","12070760"," As a matter of fact, in the open today, we didn't want to call up or down."
"12070780","12075840"," We wanted to say, wait to see if it goes up or goes down and then you start to enter"
"12075840","12078380"," calls or puts, right?"
"12080420","12081400"," Kind of a where we are."
"12081800","12083160"," So, where do you buy puts?"
"12083580","12085200"," You don't buy them off the bell down here. "
"12085380","12088860"," So, if you did buy puts off the bell down here, you were gambling, right?"
"12088860","12093860"," If you're going to wait until we get up here to buy some puts, I'm going to hold puts."
"12094580","12101320"," Well, I buy calls and puts on the web here, but I've sold the calls each time we head up"
"12101320","12101580"," higher."
"12102460","12106620"," But I'll still keep puts in here in this zone, probably even higher. "
"12108360","12113820"," I'll maintain these puts here in anticipation of some kind of a roll, right?"
"12114520","12118640"," And even if these don't print, I'll just buy calls in the way up if we continue to go higher."
"12119260","12122760"," So, either way it pays for my puts and I'm making money on the call side here."
"12124320","12125860"," That's the same thing as when we're down here. "
"12126640","12128240"," Do you want to be buying puts down here?"
"12128420","12128880"," Fuck no."
"12129540","12130840"," You don't buy inputs down here, right?"
"12131200","12132480"," And you don't want to be buying puts down here."
"12133500","12134340"," You'll be buying calls. "
"12134680","12136080"," The same thing goes for where we are right now."
"12137000","12142980"," So, the good play or the smart play to print is to be buying calls up here."
"12142980","12151440"," Now, what happened with Spock Gamma saying that we should price target this week is 430. "
"12152340","12159960"," Now, what they're saying to you is that if we get a bearish or bearish fed speakers, then we should"
"12159960","12161240"," see weakness down to 430."
"12162240","12167380"," So, we're not getting a bearish talk from fed speakers today, but we might get them tomorrow,"
"12167580","12167640"," right?"
"12167860","12174280"," So, if you get a bunch of fed speakers tomorrow, we hit this tomorrow, and you're like, oh, no, I'm"
"12174280","12174560"," fucking doomed."
"12176260","12181740"," You know, you still have until Wednesday and you actually still have until Friday for those to"
"12181740","12181960"," print. "
"12182480","12186720"," Now, if this volatility doesn't enter with the fed speakers tomorrow, they're massaging the market."
"12187600","12195640"," And the other issue too in this is the reason why Spock Gamma is saying to you that we won't"
"12195640","12201800"," get lower than 430 is because of the, we are well-hedged down to 400."
"12202260","12203280"," And we can talk about this, right?"
"12203380","12207840"," You won't actually get to 400 unless the event happens, like something bad with Ukraine. "
"12209140","12214100"," A fed speaker comes out and says we're going to point 75 or something percent."
"12215060","12220620"," Even then a fed speaker, you're still going to, it's going to be buoyed here until we get closer to"
"12220620","12222160"," OPEX or FOMC."
"12222840","12228420"," So, the trade down here, will we see this by Friday?"
"12228960","12229780"," Good chance of it. "
"12230480","12231420"," So, just be patient."
"12233200","12236280"," I certainly would not want to buy calls here."
"12236480","12240980"," If I was going to buy more calls at this point, it's going to probably be above 445. "
"12242720","12244120"," You need to buy them now."
"12244220","12245480"," You can't really enter calls."
"12246060","12246580"," This is too late. "
"12246720","12248020"," This is like a no-go zone in here."
"12249020","12250340"," Because we usually roll here."
"12251020","12255620"," And because if we're going to trade higher, you want to break out of this channel, right?"
"12256180","12260180"," You want to break out of this channel that's been going on for a month. "
"12263300","12263780"," Hold on here."
"12264760","12269480"," You want to, you want to, you can take this trade, you can take that trade, you can take that"
"12269480","12272720"," trade, and this trade, and this trade, and this trade, and you can take this trade."
"12273320","12277500"," But you don't want to be fucking around in here unless we start to go much, much higher, right?"
"12277500","12282680"," You don't need these, you don't need the day trade in here to take this long. "
"12283120","12287380"," You don't have to be the guy that says, well, I bought it right here, and we kept going higher."
"12287800","12292240"," You want to be the guy that buys it here and takes it higher for a continued call."
"12292620","12295580"," You want to just let the banks do this work for you. "
"12297240","12301940"," Otherwise, the play here is to buy some put protection and then trade it higher as we go."
"12302360","12306920"," Because the chance of this rolling over is quite high, right?"
"12306920","12310040"," We did it once right here, we did it once here."
"12310660","12312080"," Do I think it's going to happen again?"
"12312280","12313520"," Does it have a high chance of it, right?"
"12314320","12316220"," We'll roll it again at some point. "
"12316360","12320180"," Either today, tomorrow, it doesn't matter if it's today, tomorrow, Wednesday, Friday."
"12320920","12322020"," We should get a roll at some point."
"12323220","12328060"," So if you're a bear, just hang on, just chill, relax, and chill out. "
"12329200","12336520"," If you're losing money in your puts, you can always look for a signal to buy calls."
"12336520","12342680"," You're going to look for this movement here, turn into more of a bull flag than a bear flag, bread"
"12342680","12343180"," it up higher."
"12343880","12346900"," And furthermore, you're still watching these sellers. "
"12347080","12351680"," They're still sitting here at this 445, 446."
"12353660","12355920"," And the awesome trade is here, right?"
"12356520","12357920"," You can see where the good trade is."
"12358040","12358600"," It's way up here. "
"12359200","12360720"," All this clear blue sky here."
"12361200","12362740"," There's some hidden sellers up here."
"12362820","12364100"," You can see them right there. "
"12364100","12366640"," They're at 447 and 448."
"12367760","12369120"," And some more at 450."
"12372160","12372720"," But..."
"12372720","12373860"," That's heaven's name. "
"12374020","12376540"," The Fed's new policy framework is still quite sturdy."
"12377580","12380200"," And to further that point, I told you it wasn't taking any logs."
"12380500","12381200"," Thanks, Jordan. "
"12382080","12384700"," Commenting Swiss inflation expectations are well anchored."
"12385340","12385800"," In here, right?"
"12385800","12388320"," I told you this was the choppy zone from an event in Washington."
"12388980","12390200"," This is the distribution zone. "
"12390200","12396340"," This is where call buyers down here or over here are selling their calls to you, taking profit."
"12396940","12398180"," It doesn't mean we don't trade higher."
"12398400","12399840"," This isn't consolidation either. "
"12400460","12401160"," Take another leg up."
"12402380","12403960"," Take another leg up."
"12406360","12408960"," So we'll trade that if it shows itself. "
"12409380","12410280"," We'll trade that up higher."
"12411300","12416620"," But this is the area where, you know, it's kind of like a market maker's taking all your money."
"12428740","12429920"," It's just chill out, relax. "
"12431680","12434600"," If there's a trigger, you can see these sellers right in here."
"12435000","12437160"," Sellers hiding back here around 12 o'clock."
"12437900","12439180"," Just selling into you. "
"12440160","12442220"," They're call sellers up here, right?"
"12442440","12442980"," They're selling calls."
"12444340","12445240"," Does anybody know trade higher?"
"12445440","12445500"," No."
"12445840","12446760"," I'm open to a trade higher. "
"12447320","12449080"," I got no problems with this trade."
"12449380","12451920"," I got no problems with this rolling over or trading higher right now."
"12453580","12455460"," I know that I'm well hedged right now. "
"12455460","12459120"," And if an opportunity presents itself to trade higher, I'll jump on those calls."
"12460580","12462700"," And you should be well hedged with puts as well."
"12462820","12466400"," He's drawn and saying there could be some risk to price stability in Switzerland. "
"12469900","12472320"," Seeing some change in consumer behavior in Switzerland."
"12478840","12479880"," Thoughts on Twitter?"
"12480140","12481020"," Will they kill?"
"12483720","12485820"," What am I overall thoughts on Twitter?"
"12490290","12492190"," They run the gambit right now."
"12493830","12495710"," My thoughts on Twitter run the gambit. "
"12496330","12498370"," There's a lot to be said from a baseline."
"12499590","12501730"," I think last Friday we talked about this."
"12502170","12504810"," I talked to you guys about how they haven't monetized Twitter on Friday. "
"12505530","12508170"," Friday morning I said to you, you know, they haven't monetized it."
"12508530","12511510"," That became kind of a big part of that conversation over the weekend."
"12512530","12514330"," Was that Twitter has been monetized, right?"
"12514570","12519130"," And I know that people picked up on it and they're harped on it saying you could have bought a"
"12519130","12523010"," fucking anything and would have done better than Twitter has done. "
"12523010","12531050"," I think though that people missed that point though too, is that if Twitter was ever monetized"
"12531050","12534670"," properly, it could make a lot of money."
"12535890","12541150"," These Jordan's in the biggest impact on Swiss price stability comes from energy prices and supply"
"12541150","12541810"," chain problems."

"12551400","12554160"," The April 22nd 1040."
"12555100","12556660"," See one million dollars."
"12557960","12565650"," A little bit of a role going on right now in the spy was my take on Twitter is. "
"12568840","12577170"," It can be monetized now with that being said that it can be monetized."
"12581750","12583210"," There's a few things to play, right?"
"12583410","12584030"," What number one?"
"12585710","12587330"," Let's bring Twitter up over here."
"12590490","12591770"," Okay, get this big jump, right?"
"12591970","12592770"," We know we had this big jump. "
"12593090","12595970"," Start trading down, start trading down, consolidating, consolidating, right?"
"12596190","12597010"," Another boom, right?"
"12597210","12597470"," Another boom."
"12598590","12599310"," Trade it up."
"12599770","12601510"," Start to consolidate down, right?"
"12601810","12602610"," Maybe we'll get another bump. "
"12603150","12607070"," You do know that there's a bunch of call buyers down in here, right?"
"12607290","12610130"," You know there's a bunch of call buyers down in here and clear all this up."
"12610630","12613710"," You know there's a bunch of call buyers down here."
"12614330","12615750"," They want to buy any and all dips. "
"12615850","12617070"," You know there's a bunch of money down in here."
"12617670","12621810"," I forgot which there's some investment banks that they're making a bid again today."
"12622530","12624550"," I don't believe they're making a bid today. "
"12624650","12631590"," I think our investment banks are saying or groups of people are saying I'm going to put a bid in"
"12631590","12633510"," because they're long down here."
"12634450","12635830"," They just want their calls to print."
"12636030","12636830"," It's that simple. "
"12636830","12642930"," Like whenever any of this stuff is released publicly, you find out that all these fucking smart"
"12642930","12649950"," people, they're buying fucking naked puts fucking, they're buying fucking calls, just like straight"
"12649950","12650910"," up calls on stuff."
"12651270","12654030"," There is much of gamblers as the retail."
"12654290","12655410"," They say they're not. "
"12655630","12660790"," They'll tell the retail traders that they're gamblers, but then you'd like some texts will leak and"
"12660790","12663910"," you'll find out they just bought some fucking zero dates down here, right?"
"12664230","12664650"," We're not here."
"12664650","12665430"," Probably like here."
"12665590","12666850"," They bought some fucking zero dates. "
"12667110","12668470"," They bought some zero dates again."
"12668570","12669590"," They bought some zero dates again."
"12670030","12670950"," Shit like that. "
"12671090","12671650"," I shit you not."
"12672250","12673750"," This happens all the fucking time."
"12674430","12683350"," Matter of fact, one of the famous ones that did it recently was one of the fucking, the short"
"12683350","12689810"," company, Hindenburg Research, had a bunch of text messages leaked and they were buying fucking zero"
"12689810","12692830"," date puts against companies they were running shit on. "
"12692830","12696930"," So I don't put it up past any of these guys that are out there saying they're going to make"
"12696930","12697390"," a bid, right?"
"12697750","12698710"," To jack price up."
"12698950","12699870"," Anyways, point bid."
"12700250","12700610"," Getting back. "
"12700770","12701650"," I'm going off in the tangent."
"12701790","12707230"," The point I'm trying to make to you is this is a hot ticker right now to be trading."
"12707950","12711730"," Hot ticker to be buying dips on and you know that there's money coming into with calls. "
"12712750","12720350"," We talked about should you be buying puts on Twitter only if not now."
"12720350","12725350"," I don't think you can buy puts on Twitter right now because you're going to keep having companies"
"12725350","12728390"," say they're going to make some offers on Twitter."
"12729110","12730410"," I assure you of that. "
"12731670","12734030"," I assure you that any other company is going to make offers on Twitter."
"12734410","12737910"," Twitter is probably only going up on dips right now."
"12739070","12741850"," What do I think about Elon Musk buying it and bringing it private?"
"12743410","12750270"," Twitter is a weird, an enigma right now to me because it could go the way of Reddit, which is"
"12750270","12751310"," a really bad thing. "
"12752070","12754370"," If any of you guys are older, you remember a FARC?"
"12755370","12757590"," You guys remember the old boards?"
"12757930","12760770"," Even before FARC there were some use that stuff that was out there."
"12762010","12762850"," Message boards."
"12763770","12771390"," Reddit had that potential to be in a great place and then I don't know if I want to say"
"12771390","12772670"," that it was monetized. "
"12773210","12776290"," That was part of Reddit partially became monetized."
"12776290","12780210"," Lots of puts rolling in right now in the supply, the queues and XLK."
"12782270","12788330"," I don't know that there's, I don't know that there's, um, Twitter's in a weird place, right?"
"12789510","12799320"," They silence some people that shouldn't be silenced, but they silence other people that should be"
"12799320","12799900"," fucking silenced. "
"12801280","12807360"," And the reason, the thing that the balancing act for Twitter, but the job that they have is not"
"12807360","12807700"," easy."
"12808800","12812660"," So if you, if you think about the job that Twitter has, right?"
"12813920","12819400"," You have bad actors with lots of money and power, money and power."
"12819680","12820100"," That's different. "
"12820300","12821180"," There's a difference there, right?"
"12821700","12823060"," Like Chamath doesn't have power."
"12823220","12823800"," He's got money."
"12824860","12831060"," But when you look at a state actor like North Korea, China, Russia, you guys don't, you as may or"
"12831060","12835100"," may not believe this, lots of puts rolling in right now in the supply, they got $4.22, $4.40"
"12835100","12837120"," P for half million dollars. "
"12837580","12842020"," We got two queues, $4.23, $4.42 P for $250,000."
"12842300","12843900"," Got more spy puts rolling in right now."
"12844880","12848740"," So you've got all, you see, you've got all this, you got these big bad actors. "
"12849180","12850800"," Like these are fucking badasses."
"12851020","12855560"," I don't like them, but they're, you can't discount what China, Russia and North Korea is."
"12855660","12858020"," You can't, in today's day and age, right?"
"12858020","12865440"," I see some of you guys on Twitter out there and you make comments, not all of you, but some"
"12865440","12870680"," of you make comments that are farmed for your consumption. "
"12871580","12879320"," They're trying to sway not just your opinion, but they're trying to groom you into, believe it or"
"12879320","12883040"," not, into some really fucked up thought processes."
"12883640","12887840"," And so you do, to an extent, have to fucking mute those voices on Twitter."
"12888520","12891120"," You can see a place right now where they're not muted. "
"12891340","12899020"," You can go right to Reddit and you can see the astroturfing of Reddit trying to manipulate over"
"12899020","12899720"," time, right?"
"12900180","12903980"," This is kind of like when you go to a, this is something, because what, you know, it's something"
"12903980","12904560"," interesting."
"12904940","12909160"," The perfect place you can see this happen is you can see it happen in grocery stores."
"12909920","12911200"," You can see it happen at the gas pump. "
"12911740","12916820"," When you go to a grocery store today and you only see one or two people checking people out, you"
"12916820","12921680"," see like 30 lanes, and then you see this whole new checkout that you're checking your own"
"12921680","12921980"," groceries."
"12922860","12929540"," And you see like fucking 50 fucking, 50 fucking self checkouts and one cash here in this giant"
"12929540","12930060"," store."
"12930980","12932020"," Over time, right?"
"12932480","12938180"," It becomes, you become like such a child growing up seeing that difference where you're not seeing"
"12938180","12945160"," a physical person check your groceries, eventually they become used to seeing self checkout. "
"12946180","12949800"," And then you become groomed into saying, I like self checkout."
"12950540","12951660"," And then over time, right?"
"12951760","12952540"," That becomes the norm."
"12953120","12960580"," And that same thing happens in social media today, eventually over time on Reddit and other places,"
"12961160","12967180"," you'll be grooming people to expect to hear certain things repeated, repeated, repeated, repeated. "
"12967940","12972080"," And before you know it, you see someone on Twitter repeating fucking those same fucking things"
"12972080","12975980"," publicly on Twitter and you go, well, where'd that come from?"
"12976460","12982920"," Where'd that like hardcore, you know, I don't know, trucking that fucking Republican come up with"
"12982920","12983600"," this whack shit."
"12984180","12985660"," And the same thing applies to Democrats."
"12986340","12989080"," I shouldn't talk about this stuff, but it does impact Twitter. "
"12990760","12995040"," So it's a really fucked up like, it's a really fucked up thing because you see this really far left"
"12995040","12998960"," and really far right parrot talking all over social media."
"12999600","13004740"," And you can see that, believe it or not, they're both being poisoned by foreign actors."
"13005420","13007660"," And Twitter has a big job with to deal with that. "
"13007820","13012700"," And through it, I was saying this for Friday, that you can still get some truth out of Twitter."
"13012760","13018040"," You can get a verified account from a reporter, or you can get a verified account from Elon Musk,"
"13018040","13023240"," or you can get a verified account from a president or from, you know, any of these people that are"
"13023240","13023620"," verified."
"13023620","13025360"," And so it's a very tough place. "
"13025760","13029360"," I know what Elon wants to do, and I'm down with what Elon wants to do."
"13029700","13031940"," And I think they can still be monetized too."
"13032840","13040260"," I know that, I know that Quinn Invest talks passionate and has a high knowledge of, of Twitter and"
"13040260","13041480"," how fucking clunky it's become. "
"13041920","13043780"," So that's an issue for me how clunky it is."
"13044140","13045180"," It sucks that it's clunky."
"13045680","13049680"," And I don't want most voices to be quieted on Twitter either. "
"13049680","13052840"," I don't like, I like to hear everybody's voice on Twitter."
"13052840","13059680"," But it's still to some extent, and I know that Elon's saying that they can find out who the bots"
"13059680","13063780"," are and who the bots are, but they're just, dude, you, they got these fuck, these aren't bots."
"13064100","13072120"," They got buildings full of actual people that, that can post like, I didn't know it's hard to find"
"13072120","13072380"," somebody. "
"13072540","13076740"," There's some, there's an AI subreddit that I can turn you guys on to, where you can't even tell"
"13076740","13079080"," that these are AI, AI is discussing topics."
"13079080","13085060"," But even AI right now is becoming to a point where you can't decipher if that's a human or not."
"13085440","13093020"," And fuck AI, some of these actors can put just giant fucking rooms full of people posting all day"
"13093020","13093380"," long. "
"13093880","13098980"," And then you've got just the car, just the astroturfing of other social media sites where you don't"
"13098980","13105140"," even need, you don't need AI, you don't fucking need a room full of people pushing your opinion,"
"13105520","13110620"," because you're already astroturfing so many other parts of the internet, so that now you're getting"
"13110620","13115900"," fucking parrots that are Democrats and Republicans, that are saying shit that it's just not a part"
"13115900","13121440"," of our values at least, they're not the values of Western values from Europe, and yet they're"
"13121440","13123660"," seeping into our culture."
"13124360","13129640"," Now, some of that, okay, sure, I'm okay with some of that, what I don't like is the manufactured"
"13130920","13136680"," opinion that's coming in through social media, and then could be picked up by an American, let's"
"13136680","13142480"," say, or picked up by an Englishman, or picked up by an Indian, or I don't know, someone from"
"13142480","13146920"," Taiwan, it doesn't matter where they're getting picked up, or it doesn't matter what it's getting"
"13146920","13153980"," picked up, but the influence and the astroturfing is insidious, it actually reaches right out and"
"13153980","13160180"," touches you and me as a regular person, I can't trust all the information that I'm hearing in other"
"13160180","13166220"," places, and then I come on to Twitter, and I start to pump opinions, and I'm a real person, you"
"13166220","13172460"," can see me on camera, you know who I am, you know that I'm not an AI, you know, I'm"
"13172460","13177560"," not like, generated, my hand's not bouncing to the table, but at the same time, I can be influenced"
"13177560","13183880"," from some outside forces, so I don't know how Elon deals with that, but I get what he's saying, I"
"13183880","13188860"," get the point that he's trying to make that not all voices should be able to speak and not get"
"13188860","13194660"," shut down, I get it's a hard thing to do, and Twitter is, believe it or not, I was just"
"13194660","13197940"," talking with my wife about this because I didn't like Twitter for a long time, but I'm like, it's"
"13197940","13203860"," one of the last fucking places where you can get straight and fast and straight information, it's"
"13203860","13209320"," one of the last fucking places left out there that I can somewhat trust to an extent that it's Elon"
"13209320","13216660"," must fucking talking, or that it's, I don't know Biden or Trump or whoever is actually talking on"
"13216660","13218460"," Twitter, now dissenting opinion on my wife."
"13218560","13224300"," I'm telling him coming to get the G7 call saying that leader screwed on their commitment to"
"13224300","13231580"," diversifying energy supplies and reducing dependence on Russia, but to say that it's easy to say"
"13231580","13237260"," that it's easy and yeah, I don't like the Twitter, I'm not, I'm not a fan of anyone in the,"
"13237360","13242400"," anyone that works with Twitter, believe it, I mean, I'm not down with the, with the board, I'm not"
"13242400","13247060"," down with the internals of Twitter, I know that it has a lot of work that needs to be done,"
"13247620","13252740"," done to get your voice out there, but it's not an easy task either, and I think even if Elon"
"13252740","13260500"," bought it, once he gets into what actually takes place out there, it's not an easy, it's not easy"
"13260500","13265480"," to navigate, it's not, there's no easy answers, even if Elon were to buy it or some other company,"
"13265800","13270800"," I'll tell you one thing, if fucking Google bought it, or if one of these fucking large investment"
"13270800","13273340"," banks bought it, it's going to be cleaned and sanitized. "
"13274020","13279520"," If you see one of those companies buy it, you see Disney buy it, Google, if you see like a"
"13279520","13284320"," black rock buy it, tell him it's going to get corporate, it's going to get fucking asked with her,"
"13284620","13291660"," if it stays what it is right now, it's probably better than any other option right now, if Elon"
"13291660","13296660"," were to take a private, could he work on it, yeah, I think he could work on it, but do"
"13296660","13301160"," I think, do I think he's going to encounter the same fucking problems that they have, that Twitter"
"13301160","13305740"," has already, yeah, I think those same problems are going to be there, I don't think it's as easy as"
"13305740","13310800"," saying we're going to identify who the bots are and cut those people out yet, let fucking whoever"
"13310800","13315460"," have the same voice piece, I don't think certain people should have the same fucking voice piece,"
"13315880","13320960"," we're not the same voice piece, but I see guys out there, men, women, whoever, with like fucking"
"13320960","13327800"," 200,000 followers that are batshit fucking crazy and have a platform that's fucking pumped up by"
"13327800","13333520"," more batshit fucking crazy people, I'm sorry to say that, that's what it is, so I don't know about"
"13333520","13340460"," that soapbox too, right, like sometimes that soapbox doesn't deserve fucking the followers that"
"13340460","13344420"," they fucking have, or how do they get those fucking followers, how do you get fucking a million"
"13344420","13348840"," fucking followers, dude, some of these people have a million fucking followers, I'm like, how, why,"
"13349360","13354820"," where do those followers come from, I know there's arguments that let all bots, or they paid for"
"13354820","13359640"," those followers, or they do all this other shit to get those followers, they get a voice, and you"
"13359640","13367280"," know, that kind of stuff, but honestly, there's a real high danger for Twitter at all, right, at"
"13367280","13375460"," all, there's a danger for Twitter turning into an astroturf place like Reddit, even if Elon Musk"
"13375460","13380760"," works on it, that's the big problem right now, the major problem is how bad does it get on Twitter,"
"13381400","13386820"," how many voices are you going to silence to, but at the same time, how do you actually combat where"
"13386820","13394480"," it can head, how bad can it get for Twitter, so I don't envy Twitter's positioning for where they"
"13394480","13402540"," are, I don't, and the one thing that I do envy is it can be monetized, I most certainly envy"
"13402540","13408340"," that, that there's a lot of money that you've even made on Twitter, so for right now, what's my"
"13408340","13414960"," take on Twitter, my take on Twitter is there's still interest, my take on Twitter is that there's a"
"13414960","13419540"," lot of invested money in Twitter going higher, you're more than likely going to see it, I think I"
"13419540","13424040"," said 80 bucks, I think if there's any kind of legit bids out there, you'll see Twitter go to 80"
"13424040","13429720"," bucks, I think that's still in the table, 70 bucks, 80 bucks or whatever, I think that's not"
"13429720","13435240"," unreasonable to look for, if somebody is able to buy it, even if it is, even if it is astroturf"
"13435240","13440100"," from Google, astroturf from Disney, or whatever, whatever fucking company buys it, whether it's"
"13440100","13446800"," Elon or not, you're going to see it, you're going to see greed come in, you're going to see people"
"13446800","13451300"," that want to monetize and make money off of it, will that be the death of Twitter pop, possibly,"
"13451700","13455540"," probably, but they're going to try to fucking squeeze it for every last fucking penny it has,"
"13455920","13462520"," because one of those companies that hasn't made money, no, if there's Elon by it, do I care if Elon"
"13462520","13466380"," buys it or want Elon to buy, I don't know, I know that no matter who, I don't know that"
"13466380","13470860"," whoever has that fucking job, it's not going to be easy, whether it's the where's the current"
"13470860","13477540"," regime, management, upper management, that decides the direction of Twitter for if it's Elon, it's"
"13477540","13482900"," not going to be fucking easy, and it's weird too, because you're hearing some, I see some fucking"
"13482900","13489060"," crazy fucks on Twitter, they're like, that Elon's are hit their savior, and I'm like, these"
"13489060","13495480"," motherfuckers shouldn't have a fucking voice, they're bad shit fucking crazy, and this encompasses"
"13495480","13501480"," all political spectrums, it has more to do with what people are consuming elsewhere, and then shit"
"13501480","13503840"," and diary and wiping their asses on Twitter with."
"13508430","13522210"," Yeah, he is, he is planning on offering a launch of Tenderngo offer, yep, 10 days, everybody"
"13522210","13532350"," said it, I understand what you're saying, look, I've been censored by Twitter, don't"
"13532350","13537490"," get me wrong, okay, I've been, I've been kicked off Twitter, I've been shut down on Twitter, I've"

"13548110","13551570"," you'll ever do this again, so look, I've fucked, I've been on the wrong side of Twitter myself,"
"13551790","13556530"," don't, don't get me wrong here, I've gotten slapped around by the Twitter police too, and I know"
"13556530","13563350"," what you're saying about Twitter, Twitter like, Twitter allows a certain speech to take place"
"13563350","13569920"," depending upon where the regime is right now, whatever, whichever regime that is, I understand"
"13569920","13576840"," that, I understand that that they're astroturfing to a point, my point is that I can't go right"
"13576840","13583220"," now, generally speaking, I can't go on Reddit and find, and absolutely know whoever's talking is"
"13583220","13589120"," that person, and that's one good thing that I give to Twitter, I know that if I see someone"
"13589120","13594340"," specific there, but I know that it's them, that's the only trust that I have in Twitter, the only"
"13594340","13599080"," trust that I have in Twitter is if I see that it's Trump talking, or see if it's Biden talking,"
"13599440","13603500"," if I see that it's Elon talking, that they've been fucking very, and I know you can pay for"
"13603500","13608740"," verification, I know all this shit too, I know that there's all this other wack shit that goes on"
"13608740","13613260"," behind the scenes of Twitter, saying it's the only place left, it is, it's the only place left"
"13613260","13618560"," that's an outlet for people that you can see, right, media figures, pull politicians, people with"
"13618560","13625080"," power, whatever they say, you can at least know it came from them, or their promotions seem, or"
"13625080","13629360"," they're fucking, they're fucking safe, save their asses."
"13641740","13649580"," Yeah, look, I'm, you got to understand, I'm not on, I'm not on four or against Elon, I know that"
"13649580","13654080"," Twitter says, I think Chairman saying that a pictures rates go up elsewhere, that will increase"
"13654080","13659080"," differentials to other countries, and we can go back to more normal policy in Switzerland. "
"13659080","13666620"," I know what Twitter is doing is not working, right, you can feel the slow, you can feel the slowly,"
"13666880","13674580"," you can feel it slipping away, right, you can slowly just feel the freedom, quote unquote, of"
"13674580","13679440"," freedom of speech too, you could wrap a whole bunch of this stuff up in there, but you can, you"
"13679440","13684880"," can feel it slipping into what's else crazy is, I like the idea of the edit button for like,"
"13684880","13689760"," because sometimes I'll, I'll post something and then I deleted post and deleted post it, like two,"
"13689780","13693980"," three times sometimes, because I've missed something or I type wrong or I missed an A or whatever."
"13694540","13697980"," And so I like the idea of the edit button for the first five minutes or so, I don't like"
"13697980","13701280"," the idea of an edit fucking button a month down the road or a week down the road."
"13701800","13706200"," Uh, fucking pumpers, fucking ferus would have a fucking field day with that shit. "
"13706780","13710720"," You can see it right now, right, you can look at Twitter accounts, you can go on Twitter right now,"
"13711720","13717020"," I can go right to my James, right, I haven't deleted a fucking, unless I offend somebody, if I"
"13717020","13721840"," offend somebody, or if I, I've heard people's feelings and I've had you come in and say, cap,"
"13721960","13727380"," you're being an asshole, I'll be, official saying that France is willing to provide Ukraine with"
"13727380","13732400"," security guarantees, but you'll see that I don't, I don't delete tweets, I let them all stand you,"
"13732460","13736260"," if you go through, I've got like 14,000 fucking tweets, I don't delete them, but you guys can see"
"13736260","13741020"," out there, if you go to certain handles out there, ferrus and shit, you'll see like 10 tweets, 100"
"13741020","13746020"," tweets, 30,000 followers, and they just say, I'm going through to clean up my past history or"
"13746020","13748940"," whatever, it's because they don't want to fuck, they don't want you to fucking see when they, when"
"13748940","13750460"," they made a wrong call, right?"
"13751220","13756440"," Uh, or they had, had a wrong hot take on something, right?"
"13756640","13759280"," Or they didn't have enough information, quote unquote, or something like that."
"13759360","13760420"," I believe your tweets should stand."
"13761100","13763340"," I believe the things that you say should stay there. "
"13763840","13766680"," I should go back in your history and see what you're doing, right?"
"13768000","13773200"," Uh, so I don't like that idea, I don't like the idea of editing tweets, uh, other than maybe five"
"13773200","13777200"," minutes, 10 minutes, that I understand, because I've done that before, I've made posts and tweets"
"13777200","13782080"," where I'm like, fuck, or at least I could go in and just, uh, re type it or rephrase it,"
"13782260","13783460"," to rephrase it better."
"13784080","13788040"," Uh, sometimes I've made posts where I thought I was making a certain point and then it was"
"13788040","13792980"," interpreted differently under those circumstances I can see wanting to edit a tweet, but other than"
"13792980","13795100"," that, I want your shit to stand."
"13795960","13798660"," I want to see, you know, I want to look back on it in 10 years and be like, oh,"
"13798720","13803760"," that fucking guy over there said, you know, uh, this or that or whatever, you know, and some,"
"13803880","13808980"," especially the politicians and the people that make policy, uh, people that are big movers, right?"
"13809120","13813100"," You see, you see like a, a CEO of a company making a statement and then all of a sudden"
"13813100","13816820"," you find that was a fucking lie fucking two years later or three years later. "
"13817920","13819340"," Uh, I want, I want a record of that."
"13819440","13821600"," So I know there's a way back machine for that kind of stuff too."
"13821840","13825600"," So you really can't get rid of, that's the other fucked up thing, even with an edit button, you're"
"13825600","13828920"," still going to have, if matter of fact, if you get an edit button, you're probably going to see for"
"13828920","13834400"," high profile Twitter users, you're going to see a whole cottage industry pop up of original tweets"
"13834400","13835160"," being saved. "
"13835780","13840560"," So you're not really getting out of anything if you're, if you're of a certain, uh, stature."
"13841500","13843200"," But I don't see it easy for Twitter."
"13843900","13845660"," Uh, I'm not, I'm not putting blame on Twitter. "
"13845840","13849940"," I don't think it's going to be easy for Twitter to navigate this no matter who the owner"
"13849940","13855900"," is."
"13855900","13861840"," The one thing I guarantee you if the wrong people get their hands on Twitter, however this plays"
"13861840","13862600"," out, right?"
"13863460","13868380"," If there is a company that takes over Twitter and they're not, they're not, they don't have"
"13868380","13869060"," autonomy, right?"
"13869180","13874280"," If it's like a company like Google or a company like fucking Disney or fucking some kind of fucking"
"13874280","13878620"," investment bank, it's going to get fucking Astro Turf to fuck it."
"13879080","13880460"," It's going to be atrocious. "
"13880660","13886320"," And if anything, if anything, that would be the moment where you'd want to see a new, a new social"
"13886320","13886720"," media."
"13886960","13889640"," It'll probably be the death of Twitter to some extent."
"13890260","13891640"," It'll be the next evolution, right?"
"13891720","13897420"," You saw FARC, you saw Usenet, you see Reddit night, you see Twitter kind of coming into its, into"
"13897420","13899640"," its own right now word, which direction does it take?"
"13899880","13905600"," You'd probably see the rise of a new social media, uh, empire, not to replace Twitter because it's"
"13905600","13906840"," kind of is the last place. "
"13907660","13912060"," And it is kind of at a crossroads that goes down that road of Astro Turfing."
"13912220","13914440"," And that Astro Turfing could come in many forms."
"13914880","13918720"," And so I guess, am I happy with, with, uh, the Twitter people on the inside?"
"13919020","13919340"," Fuck no. "
"13919740","13922840"," They probably think that they probably think that's their ace in the hole."
"13923120","13927260"," Thanks, Jordan, saying normalization, monetary policy elsewhere would be positive for this and"
"13927260","13929360"," being give them more room to maneuver."
"13931540","13933840"," Do I think the stock price would go up whoever buys it?"
"13933980","13934540"," Yes, I do. "
"13935120","13940960"," I think the stock price would go up even more if, if, uh, if a, if a investment bank or"
"13940960","13947300"," a fucking SPAC or a fucking, you know, any one of these bullshit fucking companies actually puts a"
"13947300","13947940"," winning bid in."
"13948380","13952060"," And until that interest goes away, you're going to see a bid in Twitter too."
"13952160","13953280"," So buy every dip in Twitter. "
"13953960","13959300"," Uh, there's still money there unless, unless the sort, the corporate rating that's taking place,"
"13960280","13962120"," you're probably going to see a buyer of some kind."
"13963220","13969080"," And depending on who that buyer is, uh, it'll be like, you know, the better or the lesser of evils,"
"13969500","13978520"," the worst evil is going to be like a Google, believe it or not, or a fucking Disney or any"
"13978520","13983280"," kind of company that, that, that not cares, but cares about their image and cares about money."
"13984060","13985420"," Uh, it'll be a fucked up place. "
"13985560","13988600"," You probably only be able to go there to see tweets from people like Elon."
"13989580","13994000"," Uh, if Elon can, if Elon buys it, uh, I don't know."
"13994120","13997500"," I think he runs into the, again, we're back to the, he runs into the same problems that Twitter"
"13997500","13998560"," itself is running to. "
"13999500","14003680"," How do you, how do you navigate through the fucking disaster?"
"14004660","14005960"," Uh, that is the internet."
"14006260","14007300"," We're going to look back on this."
"14007420","14008880"," I think we're going to look back on this time. "
"14009500","14011820"," It, it, at this time of internet history."
"14012620","14014740"," I think that it might take 20 years."
"14015420","14019200"," Uh, it might just, we might, it might just, we might just be fucking hoodwinked over this. "
"14019200","14021740"," Some, the, the bull could be pulled over our eyes."
"14021740","14025300"," We don't even notice the change, uh, where we believe everything on the internet."
"14025300","14031000"," But if there's, if there's a chance, we look back on these past five or 20 years and we'll see,"
"14031560","14039520"," uh, how fucking rotten, fucking rotten the internet is right now with, with, uh, bad fucking actors"
"14039520","14043240"," from other countries, like real fucking bad actors. "
"14044280","14046040"," And it's not just other countries too."
"14046320","14048300"," It's corporations that do this shit too."
"14048420","14049200"," It's so disgusting. "
"14049920","14051560"," It's like, it's corporate, it's corporate America."
"14052320","14053740"," It's fucking other countries."
"14054420","14057020"," They pile so much shit down your throat. "
"14057660","14059480"," It blows my fucking mind."
"14061860","14063840"," It blows my fucking mind."
"14072280","14075840"," It does, it blows my fucking, doesn't the US prefer Saudi ownership. "
"14076720","14081220"," It blows my fucking mind to see where we've come to, where this, because I'm getting older, so like"
"14081220","14086580"," I kind of remember where, I remember when we were a fucking pump full of US propaganda, but I've"
"14086580","14089860"," also seen that pendulum swing to a place that's fucking bizarre."
"14090800","14092560"," It's like fully fucking bizarre."
"14094240","14096260"," Are we ruling over?"
"14096460","14096840"," It's a good question. "
"14097060","14097380"," I don't know."
"14098160","14102080"," I'm sitting on some put still with Wednesday and Friday expiry."
"14102880","14104360"," I haven't bought anything yet. "
"14105100","14109660"," Um, this looks like distribution, it just looks, or distributional, I guess it could be some"
"14109660","14110640"," consolidation in there."
"14111040","14113380"," It looks like it's turning more into some consolidation, I guess."
"14113560","14114080"," I haven't painted touch. "
"14114120","14114960"," I was on Twitter rant."
"14115840","14119780"," Um, you know, it's, it's, I don't think that it's an easy job."
"14119940","14124320"," I don't think that's an easy job for, I don't, I don't like what Twitter is doing right now, if"
"14124320","14124800"," you want to know. "
"14125180","14130140"," Uh, but at the same time, if the wrong fucking company gets their hands on Twitter, it's going to"
"14130140","14130820"," be a shit show."
"14131700","14133340"," Um, it really is."
"14133520","14134480"," It'll be a fucking shit show. "
"14135700","14137180"," It's going to be kind of squeezy right here."
"14137820","14140260"," Now lots of, there's still lots, lots of puts coming into the market."
"14140640","14142420"," Some call buyers dipping in right now too. "
"14143360","14144440"," Nice little rollover."
"14144700","14145220"," Let's take a look."
"14145540","14150340"," I'm not in anything except for puts that I've had for, had, I've been adding since, uh, since"
"14150340","14150960"," earlier today. "
"14152220","14154060"," We'll look to see if the sellers are still here."
"14156540","14158020"," Let's look higher and see less."
"14158120","14160080"," There's less fucking sellers above here. "
"14160480","14164700"," I mean, for the sellers that we had earlier back here, they're kind of still here."
"14165340","14166960"," Looks like they're slowly feeding in."
"14176320","14177000"," Let's take a look here. "
"14179020","14181740"," Sellers are most certainly weaker above here than they were earlier."
"14190960","14191880"," Let's take a look here and see."
"14195700","14198860"," Seeing call buyers stepping in right since 12 o'clock. "
"14199520","14202360"," I don't know if these guys are late to the party."
"14205250","14206490"," Let's scroll down here and take a look."
"14223740","14225420"," Let's see if there any buyers down below. "
"14228960","14229960"," Twitter's a tough one."
"14230600","14233640"," I haven't talked too much about it on, on, uh, Twitter."
"14233840","14236920"," I've tried to stay away from, uh, weighing in on it. "
"14240740","14242540"," I don't really have too much of an opinion."
"14242740","14245380"," I don't, I don't think it's, I don't think it's easy."
"14247800","14249300"," I don't think it's easy for Twitter. "
"14249640","14251700"," I don't, uh, 440, 172."
"14253640","14256500"," Looks like the fucking call buyers are just kind of hanging out here."
"14268880","14269720"," I think it a better look. "
"14273620","14274520"," Let me know what you think."
"14275020","14276560"," Let me know if you think we are weaker."
"14279540","14280440"," Let's take a look here. "
"14280980","14286740"," That's, it's weird because down here, I'm not seeing, I'm not seeing like a big, uh, hey, come to"
"14286740","14291860"," me down here, like big green or red bar down here saying come down here so I can buy a"
"14291860","14292700"," dip and send it higher."
"14294220","14298720"," What I think is that they want to get it up to that 446."
"14299200","14305640"," I think that, I think the plan is to reach for this. "
"14305760","14313100"," It's 445 and then I think I moved, I think I moved this, uh, from this, did I, did I"
"14313100","14314040"," call it a second here?"
"14316160","14319680"," I think I might have, I think I might have fucked with my, uh, my lines here."
"14321880","14323520"," I can see that lower one there."
"14323680","14325560"," I did, I did chart this this morning. "
"14325560","14334460"," This 445, 74 had another pin strike above kind of seeing that same roll here."
"14334820","14342790"," One, two, and three major resistance above here at 445 and then 446."
"14344610","14347570"," I think if we do get some weakness, it's not going to be that much lower. "
"14347790","14349530"," It looks like all the bulls are still here."
"14350230","14354030"," Not, not seeing by the dip lower here right now is bullish."
"14357370","14358450"," You can see them right. "
"14358610","14359210"," They're not anywhere."
"14359570","14360690"," They're not sitting down here."
"14360910","14364990"," There's a little bit, a little line down below here at 442 52. "
"14370980","14373920"," I think the idea is that that bulls want to see 446."
"14374420","14374980"," That's what I think."
"14375260","14377800"," The bulls want to see 445, 446. "
"14381500","14387100"," So we'll, we'll continue to watch and see if we get another round of, uh, we need, what you need"
"14387100","14387980"," is more call buying."
"14388480","14389180"," Lots of it."
"14389520","14392900"," So if we see lots of, another round of call buying at any point, we'll go long. "
"14393200","14397360"," If not, I'm just going to sit here in these puts and wait, it's going to roll over if we"
"14397360","14398060"," don't see call buying."
"14398240","14404580"," So we want to see call buying, uh, or real money buying, uh, if we're going to continue a pyre"
"14404580","14404860"," from here."
"14406960","14409340"," If not, we'll trade lower until we find more buyers. "
"14411200","14413200"," Let's see what you guys are saying about Twitter up in here."
"14413980","14415580"," So your thoughts aren't Twitter and Disney."
"14416380","14426080"," Yeah, my fucking,"
"14426220","14431140"," my, my fucking mind is blown when I see, when I see poor people fighting with each other. "
"14431820","14433160"," That shit blows my fucking mind."
"14433320","14434840"," It turned all of you against each other."
"14434940","14435760"," It doesn't matter what your political. "
"14436740","14438600"," Russian Central Bank saying they're easy."
"14439360","14446380"," Forex currency control measures for Russian exports focused companies, excluding commodities and"
"14446380","14447160"," exchange sector."
"14458080","14460760"," I prefer American zaster to having the Russians to be honest. "
"14471440","14471760"," Yeah."
"14471960","14472200"," Oh, God."
"14472300","14473380"," I wish you could go back to the 80s. "
"14473480","14474480"," Life was simpler and happier."
"14474560","14476000"," But how am I going to live without my phone?"
"14476220","14478900"," Uh, I don't mean, yeah, there was a time, right?"
"14479680","14481880"," There was a time where we weren't second phones all day long."
"14481880","14482780"," Dude, life was good. "
"14483300","14489020"," Uh, I was a real young kid then, but those, those years were good years."
"14492370","14493190"," It's interesting."
"14493610","14498370"," So when I lived in some pretty cool places, they lived in mountain towns and beach towns. "
"14499430","14503090"," And you don't focus so much on it."
"14503150","14504770"," You actually do get out and do stuff."
"14505010","14505970"," You get out and actually surf. "
"14506750","14508990"," You get out and actually ski and hike and bike."
"14510470","14514570"," But I recently moved to a place that doesn't do that."
"14515570","14516070"," A lot of that. "
"14516330","14517530"," They do it, but not a lot of it."
"14518270","14519110"," And so I've seen more."
"14519310","14524950"," I can, I see a lot of middle America and suburbia and places. "
"14525310","14529570"," I was at a concert recently and I can't believe when people aren't, aren't enjoying the show."
"14529850","14531250"," I was, I was taken aback."
"14532250","14537490"," Uh, actually enjoying the moment that you're living in, like those days are over for a lot of"
"14537490","14537790"," people. "
"14538350","14540550"," Unless they are around those things all the time."
"14545950","14551610"," It's to get their fucking cameras out rather than dancing to the music or singing the music or, you"
"14551610","14553510"," know, experiencing what a show actually is."
"14554350","14555350"," So this is kind of bizarre. "
"14560960","14562700"," What's going on with options position?"
"14562940","14564420"," I'm not, I'm seeing a mixed bag right now."
"14564420","14566400"," I'm seeing people load up on calls and puts."
"14570680","14572500"," So am I totally anti free speech?"
"14572960","14574640"," No, I'm 100 free speech. "
"14574980","14577700"," I am totally 100% free speech."
"14578300","14586280"," What I'm saying to you is that, uh, free speech on social media today, right, is not what you think"
"14586280","14586800"," it is."
"14588080","14589900"," It's not what you think it is. "
"14591000","14592400"," That's what I'm saying to you."
"14594360","14599460"," I'm saying to you that I'm saying to you that when I'm standing in a room, right, but I'm talking"
"14599460","14602020"," to somebody, right, but that's free speech, right?"
"14602300","14607300"," If I'm talking to you, if I know you in person, right, and you know me, that's free speech."
"14608920","14612320"," But what I'm talking about on the internet is that it's not real. "
"14613460","14620200"," It's not real and they're trying to figure a way to combat what's real and what's not on on social"
"14620200","14620680"," media."
"14621220","14625660"," And there's a lot of forces out there that are trying to not give free speech."
"14625940","14628460"," You might think you have, you might think, who's this guy?"
"14628900","14629740"," Ilvious Rory. "
"14630820","14634560"," You might think, hey, well, my freedom of speech is being infringed upon on Twitter."
"14634800","14635280"," Well, it's not."
"14636520","14637600"," Twitter's a private cover. "
"14637840","14640760"," They're a public company, but they're not a soapbox on the corner."
"14642040","14642820"," They're a company."
"14643000","14644600"," Whether you like that or not, that's what they are. "
"14645300","14648320"," You don't have fucking free speech on Twitter."
"14648640","14654760"," You don't have fucking free speech on fucking Reddit or any of these other platforms."
"14655180","14658040"," And that's what we kind of get lost on what free speech is. "
"14658660","14659920"," You get crafted speech."
"14661280","14664760"," So what the question is, who's doing the crafting?"
"14665780","14667040"," No one cares about you."
"14668300","14669300"," Yves Rory. "
"14669760","14671880"," No one cares about me, Captain Jim James."
"14672980","14678580"," But they do care about these big state actors and what their power influences and who they're"
"14678580","14678980"," influencing."
"14680280","14681940"," So do I believe in free speech?"
"14682340","14683180"," 100 fucking percent. "
"14683360","14683820"," That was in the army."
"14684320","14687520"," I fucking served my country so that you could have free fucking speech."
"14688220","14691420"," I believe in free speech. "
"14692320","14693440"," 100 fucking percent."
"14696480","14699440"," I mean, I got a little boy who's going to rabbit hole with this stuff."
"14701760","14702860"," Let me see what else is saying. "
"14703060","14704480"," Free speech is a double edged sword nowadays."
"14705020","14707380"," Ah, no, I think free speech used to be a double edged sword."
"14708940","14714800"," I think a lot of what you're consuming and I'm consuming is crafted by the highest fucking bitter,"
"14715140","14716380"," which is fucking crazy. "
"14717220","14719560"," So I think if I was probably going to ask to be an awful test."
"14719720","14720440"," Yeah, I think it is."
"14721120","14722260"," He'll run for regularly ground. "
"14722480","14723100"," He's only ever run."
"14723220","14724160"," I guess read that one already."
"14725360","14730300"," Of course, ma'am, she'll liquidity at 4, 4, 2, 5, that act as a target supporting bus. "
"14730540","14731440"," So I have no idea."
"14733480","14734960"," Liquidity at 4, 4, 2, 5."
"14738720","14741380"," I delete my tweets whenever I buy for a job hilarious."
"14743000","14745080"," Jack Dorsey owns less of Twitter than I do. "
"14748430","14750310"," We had to call it Tesla Q."
"14754110","14755030"," 30,000."
"14755130","14755430"," I was tweets."
"14756470","14756850"," Jesus Christ. "
"14762470","14764070"," So the ownership Disney."
"14764370","14765290"," You'd be surprised."
"14768750","14771290"," Where's liquidity on spy?"
"14773030","14774950"," There's none showing itself right now. "
"14775090","14778470"," So right here, you can see some right here."
"14778750","14782710"," 4, 4, 1, 7, 3, right below v-wap is some liquidity."
"14785420","14788800"," That's where you can see it right here. "
"14788960","14789860"," I'm still going to show it to you."
"14793240","14797020"," There's a better way to show you where liquidity is right there."
"14798420","14799560"," You can see it right here. "
"14800760","14805660"," This is a 4, 4, 4, 2, 5, 8, so that higher."
"14805920","14812180"," 4, 4, 2, 7, 6, 4, 4, 2, 2, 9, and then a big block down below at 4, 4,"
"14812340","14812780"," 1, 8, 2."
"14814140","14818680"," If you guys want to see lower liquidity as you can see it right here, tied and down below here."
"14820300","14821520"," Right down in here. "
"14822440","14823300"," Does he see it?"
"14823780","14829500"," Some bees Jordan saying that Switzerland is impacted a little by financial sanctions against"
"14829500","14829860"," Russia."
"14832320","14833920"," I think a little bit closer here."
"14842180","14842900"," Right down there. "
"14843220","14844040"," There's some right there."
"14844480","14852880"," 4, 4, 1, 7, 2, 4, 4, 2, 5, 9, but even with it being here, this looks like lots"
"14852880","14853360"," of support."
"14853920","14855720"," This whole area looks like lots of support. "
"14857100","14860980"," Usually you'll see a big giant red bar much, much lower and you're not seeing that."
"14861180","14864340"," So it looks like the bulls are balls deep all in where we are currently."
"14867240","14868000"," Hold on here. "
"14868840","14870020"," Just a second."
"14877600","14880720"," This, uh, this bear flag is turning into nice little squeeze play."
"14883930","14885230"," Looking tasty right here. "
"14886430","14892210"," If that's still inverse repo operation, 80 kind of parties taking 1.82 trillion dollars."
"14894050","14895030"," We can real tasty."
"14902160","14903940"," This is this prior resistance. "
"14904880","14910580"," This line right here is, uh, this line right here is some prior resistance going back into our"
"14910580","14910800"," week."
"14911560","14914860"," I'll show you guys where that is right up here."
"14917120","14919420"," Here and here going back to the 12th. "
"14925570","14926950"," For right where we are."
"14930860","14936320"," Uh, 445 is our major resistance line by flow turning hard with their fairly strong calls selling"
"14936320","14936620"," arms."
"14937960","14940260"," Yesterday, how are you guys playing this and stuff?"
"14941580","14943200"," Um, what's some of you guys are saying?"
"14945980","14951030"," Hold on, guys, what must be you guys fan?"
"14952530","14953130"," Budget tweets. "
"14953850","14954330"," That's first them."
"14954990","14955750"," Life was good."
"14955850","14956070"," I agree. "
"14957850","14959430"," Is vol Wiz not on Twitter anymore?"
"14959650","14959970"," I haven't checked."
"14960290","14960910"," I haven't seen him."
"14961070","14961690"," I haven't been on Twitter. "
"14961830","14962690"," Dude, you guys don't understand."
"14962870","14964010"," I'm not even on Twitter that much anymore."
"14964650","14966010"," I can't respond to people. "
"14966290","14967390"," I can't talk to people."
"14967790","14970870"," I've had a really tough go of interacting on Twitter lately."
"14971910","14974090"," I haven't had the time to so I haven't checked it out. "
"14974090","14974550"," I'm all looking."
"14974670","14978130"," I'll check it out on the G7 call today saying Biden and allies."
"14978630","14981030"," Great to continue coordination on Ukraine. "
"14981470","14985550"," Well, I'll look up a vol Wiz right now and see what does he disappear from Twitter?"
"14987230","14988890"," I like him a lot, by the way."
"14994960","14996200"," He's a kick-ass follow."
"14997080","14997620"," Did he?"
"14999080","15003200"," Does he, uh, is he still on Twitter or do you delete his account?"
"15006700","15007540"," No, he's still on Twitter. "
"15015580","15016180"," Oh, shit."
"15016340","15018280"," Did he delete a bunch of his shit and disappear?"
"15018900","15019540"," Holy shit."
"15019980","15020860"," What happened to vol Wiz?"
"15022280","15023900"," I'll have to reach out to him and see if he's okay. "
"15025180","15026020"," He should be okay."
"15026160","15026640"," He seems fine."
"15027440","15030000"," He probably has a private handle now if I had to guess. "
"15031060","15031980"," I'll check in on him."
"15032120","15032720"," Thanks for saying something."
"15034220","15035720"," There's signs that are creepy in the age of grandma. "
"15036100","15036400"," Yep, yep."
"15036740","15043760"," There were signs of it."
"15043760","15044720"," There's always people recording. "
"15044940","15046680"," Are you there, pointless for everyone else?"
"15047340","15048320"," I stand with zoomers."
"15049200","15052160"," Could it be at 4, 4, 2, 5?"
"15053280","15056440"," The biggest annoyance that I show are constantly and people hold their phones in front of their"
"15056440","15056620"," face."
"15056840","15057800"," Plenty of subscribers of video. "
"15057920","15058520"," I was doing that job."
"15059440","15060100"," Dude's bizarre."
"15060460","15064380"," Like, um, dude, man, you go, like, you used to go to the go to shows, man. "
"15065180","15069800"," And it's like, part of going to the show is like meeting people and people that like what you like"
"15070280","15072220"," and then the feel of the show."
"15072580","15073280"," I went to the show recently."
"15073580","15074520"," I couldn't fucking believe. "
"15075140","15079920"," It was like they piled them in, packed them in, passed us to elbows, charged stupid fucking money."
"15081040","15085560"," There's still some places you, you know, to treat those as like a hub of music."
"15086120","15087260"," I'll fucking tell you what, dude. "
"15087360","15092920"," I went in for a sec to say that the windows me still healed court ruling on the mask mandates."
"15093840","15100340"," If you live in between two places, like in between like Denver and L.A. and you catch bands on"
"15100340","15101960"," their, on the middle of that."
"15101960","15105960"," It's not in CDC, it continues to recommend that masks be worn on the airplanes. "
"15106680","15108700"," In the middle of that tour, it's a way better experience."
"15109020","15112040"," People are, it's, uh, it's changed."
"15112860","15115480"," Tina, I think of some shows, the bills they bought, not a little bit. "
"15116420","15120600"," If I have your speech on Twitter, why would my tweets get banned and me put into it for over"
"15120600","15121100"," 12 hours?"
"15121920","15123600"," Yeah, I've been putting Twitter at corner."
"15123840","15124160"," I've been banned."
"15125640","15127240"," Uh, you'd read a term of story in this video. "
"15127440","15128020"," It's not a public square."
"15128200","15128740"," It's not a public square."
"15129040","15131620"," It's not what you, I know you think it is, but it's not. "
"15133400","15134880"," Uh, anyone playing Netflix?"
"15135280","15135360"," Nope."
"15135780","15135800"," Fuck."
"15135800","15136800"," No, I'm not playing Netflix. "
"15137860","15139820"," Unless television faces more advanced propaganda."
"15140600","15147300"," Uh, I know people are becoming less intelligent and I think they're also facing advanced"
"15147300","15147700"," propaganda."
"15151470","15154290"," Uh, of course, because you guys buy, uh, I bonds you fuck. "
"15154470","15155270"," Yeah, I bonds, baby."
"15155830","15156790"," There's a lot of support."
"15156990","15157970"," Maybe not to be too short. "
"15158110","15159430"," You can buy 10K per person."
"15159550","15159830"," That's right."
"15160270","15161550"," Yields nine fucking percent. "
"15162650","15164770"," Um, 13 Bravo."
"15166770","15167730"," That was my MOS."
"15168470","15170290"," Uh, they don't yield 9% yet. "
"15170750","15175810"," Uh, speculation, they lower and re- uh, rerated in May 7th, 7.22 currently."
"15176690","15178410"," Just, you guys talked about my Discord yesterday."
"15178850","15180770"," Yeah, that's a banging, banging investment, by the way. "
"15182010","15182570"," Good pop."
"15182630","15184170"," Yes, I put some kind of leap."
"15184310","15185010"," I missed what you would say. "
"15185150","15189250"," We're saying, how much will we be going on TLC seems like it's time to get some leaps and forget"
"15189250","15189470"," it."
"15189850","15190250"," Yeah."
"15190510","15191410"," Uh, I think it is. "
"15191630","15196890"," I think, I think here, I think 118 down to 105, he's buying and fucking forgot him just by the"
"15196890","15197090"," underlying."
"15198290","15202030"," The thing to do would be to fucking just buy the underlying and just sell some fucking puts."
"15203010","15204990"," To sell like puts 65 and under. "
"15205570","15210170"," For 75 and under 65 and under and just ride the fucking gravy train on TLT."
"15211590","15212690"," It doesn't even matter."
"15214290","15215030"," That's what I think. "
"15215290","15217150"," I think about TLT is just buy it."
"15218670","15219930"," Just accumulate TLT."
"15220270","15225130"," I didn't know I've always, uh, disappeared from Twitter. "
"15234270","15234910"," That sucks."
"15236990","15238510"," He's got a whole crew of guys too."
"15239930","15242050"," Enough to look up and see what all those guys are doing. "
"15242250","15245390"," Like he's got a fucking banger gang of traders that he trades with."
"15250500","15250900"," Okay."
"15255000","15257160"," Options positioning suggest ripping the clothes. "
"15257520","15257620"," No."
"15259040","15261880"," I think that I think I don't know if we rip into clothes."
"15262280","15268140"," Uh, if we, the vault triggers down, I mean, if we get a, if we get a dip down here,"
"15268140","15273380"," if we can get a dip down here, I would see some kind of a, I would say that yes,"
"15273380","15276380"," you'll see any kind of a dip down here, you'll see it get bought. "
"15278060","15279060"," Uh, that's what I think."
"15282160","15284680"," Any kind of dip down here, you'll see, you'll see this get bought."
"15285360","15287880"," Uh, the question then becomes does it dip down this far?"
"15288940","15289680"," Probably not. "
"15289920","15294000"," It's probably going to consolidate because I think, I think everyone knows, everyone knows they're"
"15294000","15296020"," going to just keep buying until it goes up into the bell."
"15298160","15300660"," Uh, I'll probably miss this trade."
"15301700","15307660"," The thing to do is to buy this now between now and let's call it 230. "
"15308760","15317260"," Uh, well, that's 230, but let's say between now and, uh, yeah, 230."
"15317960","15319940"," Between now and 230, buy this dip."
"15320600","15324200"," Uh, for, or I'll, I'll buy this dip, but the key for me is I'm cheap as fuck. "
"15324200","15326340"," So I only want to buy this dip."
"15326580","15335320"," I don't, I don't want to buy this dip because if it, because if it goes down, I'm going to"
"15335320","15336180"," have to add to it."
"15337120","15341380"," Um, so of course, I'm going to be cheap as fuck and wait for it to come down here so"
"15341380","15344380"," I can, I can get that second stab at it somewhere down in here. "
"15345200","15350260"," Uh, I'm assuming that's what all the other call buyers are thinking right now is wait for a better"
"15350260","15350600"," price."
"15353380","15356780"," Now, I can't go here with that and miss the train."
"15356960","15357140"," Sure. "
"15357680","15358920"," Uh, uh, can I miss the train?"
"15359040","15359240"," Sure."
"15360620","15365420"," Uh, but I have some sitting on some puts over here and they, they're not going to want these to"
"15365420","15365980"," print, right?"
"15366960","15368660"," Uh, they're not going to want these to print."
"15369040","15372820"," I get, with the combination of this, I'll get a print out of this if we get down here. "
"15374840","15378380"," Uh, so I'm just going to wait here and see what happens."
"15379100","15383800"," Now, if we see a bunch of spy calls come rolling through, uh, we'll trade this higher."
"15384120","15385280"," So this is the middle of the day. "
"15387340","15389320"," This is like there's not much to go on here."
"15397160","15398080"," So he did it up."
"15398280","15400080"," Well, I'm leaving your saying that he did it a few days ago. "
"15400080","15401420"," Didn't see any precursors or anything."
"15404320","15406280"," Yeah, of course they, they checked out."
"15408800","15410800"," Of course, we can check that after lunch. "
"15414710","15415990"," So of course they checked out."
"15417550","15419130"," I didn't want to come back from my lunch."
"15420710","15424990"," My assumption is that this is what we're, you know, what do they say back here?"
"15426490","15428790"," I think it was at 11 for time. "
"15429410","15435230"," I think this is 11.45, but right around 11.30, I said, I have no fucking interest in buying"
"15435230","15435850"," this, right?"
"15436950","15441150"," Uh, into this 12 o'clock hour, I was like, I have no fucking interest in here."
"15441750","15443430"," No, this is like, this is where you get murdered."
"15444450","15445930"," A straight fucking murder you in here. "
"15446190","15447610"," This is like the no go zone."
"15448170","15449430"," Don't fuck around with it."
"15460400","15463860"," Yeah, he did it a few days ago on him. "
"15464020","15465580"," I don't know why he disappeared from Twitter."
"15469060","15471220"," Or why he's out of Twitter right now."
"15471300","15473300"," I think everybody needs to take a break every once in a while. "
"15474100","15474600"," It's hot."
"15475240","15476820"," I don't know about you guys out there."
"15476960","15481160"," It's weird when I so when I was just like trading and then I'd just pop on Twitter and stuff,"
"15481520","15482700"," it was pretty easy. "
"15484900","15487480"," But you know, like every now and again, you just need a fucking break."
"15487700","15490860"," You're like, you're like, I need a fucking break from this today or tomorrow."
"15493940","15495380"," I understand why people take a break. "
"15498390","15499350"," I get it."
"15499730","15501010"," I get away people take a break."
"15501690","15508370"," I get no will towards anyone that takes a break from Twitter or for social media or YouTube. "
"15508970","15510310"," I don't know how some people do it."
"15510450","15511030"," They're like machines."
"15512290","15517490"," Um, they like, I give all the respect in the world to some of these guys that are like all"
"15517490","15520570"," like people that are always on social media and non fucking stop. "
"15521290","15522410"," I don't know how they do it."
"15522890","15524250"," I don't know how they trade and do it."
"15525330","15529190"," I don't know that I believe the most of them trade like guys like me Kevin, like maybe, but I"
"15529190","15533190"," don't know man like fucking you got to have a he's probably got a whole team that you don't see"
"15533190","15537090"," he has to like there's just no fucking what maybe you get some people are built for it. "
"15537090","15537850"," I'm not built for it."
"15538550","15543170"," I can't do it fucking constantly fucking all fucking day every day, weekend, week out."
"15543710","15545310"," All the fucking power to if you can. "
"15546050","15546810"," I can't."
"15548530","15549810"," Hey, wait, how's it going?"
"15551590","15552770"," Tesla puts a green A."
"15553510","15554690"," Yeah, I gotta get a word."
"15555030","15558090"," It's gotta be where I have a couple thousand people watching your thoughts over it. "
"15558110","15558470"," It's not yet."
"15558630","15559410"," It's just it's tiring."
"15561170","15566050"," And you kind of have like a you have to have like a not just a certain mental fortitude. "
"15566990","15571450"," Um, but you know, you get weirded out sometimes and then you get like, you can just get tired."
"15573170","15575290"," Sometimes you don't want to know what the answer is that day."
"15575530","15576850"," Sometimes you don't want to trade that day. "
"15577050","15579010"," Sometimes you're just like, man, I want to do something else that day."

"15704810","15706050"," Let's see what's down there. "
"15708490","15713010"," Okay, so what you're looking for down here is there's a little bit of buyers right where we are."
"15714450","15728700"," 442.57. There is buyers down below at 441.70. Stronger"
"15728700","15736720"," support at 441.70. And then big buyers at 440."

"15836100","15836780"," Do we get down here?"
"15840310","15841770"," 1, 2, and 3."
"15844090","15846470"," We'll see if this can hold here if it comes down."
"15847010","15850810"," Watching some puts come in on the spy and QQQ's. "

"15853210","15854110"," April 20th, 444."
"15854950","15856070"," C for $99,000. "
"15856530","15858350"," So you get the first thing to go here."
"15873980","15879440"," The US press secretary Pasky."
"15879560","15882660"," US and allies agreed to continue cooperation on Ukraine. "
"15884880","15888980"," Justice Department might still appeal court ruling on mask mandates."

"15896400","15897960"," Nice little bounce down here. "
"15904300","15911420"," China Ministry of Foreign Affairs, official Lee Yucheng tells Russian ambassador that China will"
"15911420","15913380"," keep strengthening its coordination with Russia."

"15915060","15916480"," This is what I was talking about earlier, right?"
"15917280","15923040"," Chinese Minister of Affairs saying that they're telling the Russian ambassador that China will keep"
"15923040","15925640"," strengthening its coordination with Russia. "
"15926280","15932240"," I was talking to you guys about that earlier this morning about shortages, right?"
"15932420","15935360"," Are they manufactured or not?"
"15937240","15938860"," Does it help to weaken?"
"15939400","15942680"," It's almost like a trade embargo against the US."
"15952940","15954440"," Let's see if we get any rejection here."
"15960520","15961480"," What are you guys saying?"
"15963060","15963960"," Let's go back up. "
"15964800","15965960"," Let's end the day with Red, please."
"15966740","15966980"," For sure."

"15979020","15979960"," Oh, yeah."
"15981180","15982280"," Oh, yeah. "
"15986580","15990640"," I have I have different I've got trusts."

"16002160","16003120"," Yeah, back from lunch."
"16005080","16006540"," Oh, they're back from lunch, right?"
"16007160","16009720"," We just broke in 440 NES for the first time today."
"16010020","16010320"," Good point. "
"16010980","16015400"," Why there are such large bear camps like there are bulls or bears just wanting much lower entry to"
"16015400","16017540"," get back and long or they always bearish."
"16018520","16022300"," Do you guys see the absolute silic heard and after eight years since you looked at it?"
"16022740","16023460"," No, I haven't."
"16023520","16024360"," Did it go that below six?"
"16025520","16026600"," Can eight or go below six?"
"16029040","16031080"," And that's right where it should be six dollars, right?"
"16031320","16032660"," We've their support at six dollars. "
"16033160","16033840"," But yeah, there is."
"16033940","16034940"," That was a fucking slaughter."
"16035180","16035520"," Wasn't there. "
"16036280","16037220"," So that's six ten."
"16037720","16042360"," Let's see if Ada is still holding that support at six bucks."
"16046940","16047640"," We'll let it out. "
"16047820","16048580"," We'll let that load up."
"16049700","16051560"," Some buyers stepping in right now on the spy."
"16054400","16055920"," Ada is still rolling over to six. "
"16056060","16056680"," That's six ten."
"16056820","16057740"," We'll see if they can break through."
"16061110","16063070"," Why there are such large bear camps?"
"16064010","16065010"," There are bulls. "
"16065390","16071930"," I think that I think on the one I think on the one side of things, I think there's like"
"16071930","16073110"," three there's different camps."
"16073870","16076410"," There's like traders, investors, bears, bulls."
"16077170","16083790"," I think that some people just feel naturally naturally feel it's like that's that six dollar"
"16083790","16084150"," support. "
"16085610","16089610"," Let's look at that."
"16090250","16092830"," A little bit of capitulation here at that six dollars."
"16093710","16096330"," Let's see where support is below six dollars. "
"16096790","16098130"," You get a free fall from here."
"16099710","16101030"," Got a five dollars."
"16103310","16104550"," Look at it over. "
"16104910","16106470"," Let's load up some some time."
"16107970","16110170"," It's a little like six hours."
"16110490","16111870"," Let's load six hours in. "
"16114630","16124430"," Yeah, there's fucking Tesla just fucking dicking around at 10.30. We'll load up six"
"16124430","16125090"," hours in Ada."
"16126690","16129510"," This is some buyers stepping in currently on the spy."
"16129850","16131350"," You can see this big red bar down here. "
"16135720","16136760"," Some dip buyers."
"16138200","16140160"," I don't know about there."
"16140360","16142800"," I think some people are just I think some people I think we're at the bat. "
"16143040","16144840"," Some people like to short or long."
"16145640","16148340"," Naturally, they feel more comfortable on one side of the other of the trade."
"16150300","16154800"," I just watched a program on YouTube. "
"16156140","16158220"," I will post it for you on Twitter tonight."
"16158440","16158760"," Someone right."
"16159080","16165560"," I forget who recommended it to me, but I just watched a trader psychology interview. "
"16166080","16167340"," I didn't have a lot of views either."
"16167540","16168380"," Had like 500 views."
"16168560","16169860"," I'll show it to you guys. "
"16170420","16175960"," The psychology of traders and investors, what they feel comfortable of the long or the short side."
"16177280","16181680"," I think it's more I think a lot of it too is like bears and bulls more of like a"
"16181680","16184380"," it lends just color and to the market."
"16184380","16187720"," It lends sometimes I'll make fun of bulls. "
"16187960","16188520"," I'll make fun of bears."
"16189700","16192080"," But I don't really have like overall I'm a bull."
"16192400","16194120"," I had to guess like I'm probably a bull. "
"16195580","16198760"," Generally speaking, but I'll fuck around bulls and bears."
"16198760","16203960"," I think it's more just like a soap opera, you know, trying to piss the day away by the day"
"16203960","16204200"," away."
"16205540","16211160"," I think some people are trying to sell, you know, sell a story as well. "
"16214580","16215360"," Let's look at Ader."
"16216220","16217600"," Ader just ate a bag of dicks."
"16218440","16219800"," Not a lot of support there on Ader. "
"16220800","16223400"," That's $6 support that I was showing earlier is breaking."
"16224580","16226960"," If there was a place to buy the dip, this is probably it."
"16228820","16231360"," If you don't buy this, if you can see it right there, right?"
"16231520","16233780"," Six bucks, we talked to mention this earlier. "
"16234620","16237380"," This would be the place to buy the dip because if you don't buy the dip here, right?"
"16237860","16239040"," It's a fucking free fall."
"16241100","16255250"," I'm kind"
"16255250","16256410"," of see it better right there."
"16257630","16260110"," Lots of buyers down here at five now, but they were up here. "
"16260190","16261530"," They pulled the rug at six."
"16261790","16269350"," They were they were here and they've kind of pulled the rug and it's bouncing right at six dollars."
"16269570","16270390"," We'll see if this holds. "
"16279530","16283490"," The place to buy a dip here is probably down here at this five dollar market."
"16284690","16286230"," One, two, three."
"16286730","16287850"," This is beautiful right here. "
"16288370","16289550"," No one expected that."
"16291450","16296090"," So if you wanted to buy a dip, you'd be looking down here somewhere on Ader."
"16301980","16305860"," Y'all post something on this family office. "
"16306200","16307500"," Who said family office, Winky?"
"16318120","16319000"," Home office."
"16319500","16321800"," See, like all those old bucks that you see those big goes."
"16322320","16322700"," I know shit. "
"16323880","16324060"," Family."
"16324240","16325060"," It's family office."
"16330780","16333340"," There's have have often more contrarian mindset. "
"16333700","16334140"," Yep."
"16335120","16336400"," There are all kinds of traders."
"16338040","16339960"," I'm a contrarian trader oftentimes. "
"16340280","16341540"," I'm known as a contrarian trader."
"16344720","16347100"," Sometimes I get pulls with something I'm not a bull, but I am."
"16347480","16349300"," I take contrarian trades often. "
"16351380","16356940"," Yes, look at your aspects over 10 years in front of you a bear because I always get shit ongoing"
"16356940","16360060"," long or early when trading top tick buys where my specialty."
"16360600","16360600"," Yeah."
"16361500","16361980"," Right. "
"16362160","16363080"," Special saying that right."
"16363360","16365460"," It's fitted steel but plus oil increases."
"16366100","16367300"," Silly litter isn't easy. "
"16374260","16375540"," See what the spies doing."
"16376480","16378980"," Spies trying to pull its pants up and save itself here."
"16379760","16380580"," Big swoop down. "
"16386369","16387810"," Yeah, bulls are all in here."
"16389070","16391689"," 441-70 still an area of interest here."
"16392369","16395050"," And as well as what was the other one?"
"16395050","16396730"," Yeah, down here, 444. "
"16396830","16397550"," This is where the real money is."
"16397630","16401410"," If you're a bull and you want to know where the real money is, 440 flat."
"16417950","16419630"," And how does that translate over here?"
"16419790","16421070"," We kind of put it out here earlier. "
"16421390","16425490"," We have one dip buy, two dip buy, and three dip buy down here, 440."
"16426710","16431970"," The anticipation would be if we don't get more call buyers that you'll start to roll down until you"
"16431970","16435090"," find that support for a trade hire."
"16435349","16441450"," Now, that doesn't mean that we actually trade down a 440 and then trade hire either. "
"16441590","16442669"," We can just trade hire here."
"16443490","16446369"," There's nothing saying this happens often, right?"
"16446830","16450070"," You're waiting for this dip buy down here and you miss it."
"16451509","16453310"," I'd prefer to miss this trade. "
"16455130","16457430"," You like I'd prefer me personally."
"16457430","16460410"," I'd prefer to miss this trade hire."
"16461369","16467830"," Then if I did this 10 times, right, I'm probably going to lose three out of 10 times. "
"16467830","16472669"," If not higher, maybe three to five out of, I'll lose three out of five of these trades."
"16475070","16481790"," I actually lose, believe it or not, three to five."
"16482689","16492450"," Now, if I wait for this trade down below to take it higher, if the rug doesn't get pulled down"
"16492450","16494869"," here, I'll probably win. "
"16496689","16503650"," Like not everybody, like seven to nine minimum and make a lot of money on this trade."
"16504250","16505090"," Does that make sense?"
"16505290","16506509"," Because I'm making sense."
"16507869","16512210"," So the easier trade is waiting for a move lower. "
"16513270","16517369"," This one here, dude, like this is a dangerous trade, like it or not."
"16517770","16523169"," If you take this trade right now that we're going higher right where we are, it's a fucking pure"
"16523169","16523529"," gamble."
"16524910","16525730"," That's what it is. "
"16526369","16530770"," If you wait to find where the real money is, where the real banks are willing to buy it, this"
"16530770","16532130"," is where it's at right down there."
"16533250","16537750"," Now, when it gets down here, if there's a rug pull, it'll keep going down."
"16539230","16544250"," But if you start to see the buyers lining up in here, we'll take that trade. "
"16544890","16548090"," I'll take that trade, but I'm not risking this trade."
"16548270","16552630"," I know how this goes right here because I've done it before, you buy this trade fucking 10 minutes"
"16552630","16555210"," later, it's right down here."
"16556250","16559230"," And what I did was I just bought someone's fucking bag from over here. "
"16560110","16561630"," Someone just sold me their bags."
"16562610","16566540"," I have no interest in buying your bags."
"16567060","16567119"," None. "
"16569520","16570080"," Zero."
"16572800","16574700"," What does this thing do?"
"16575340","16575560"," Whoa."
"16576380","16577160"," Oh shit. "
"16578860","16579980"," It's a paint can."
"16581599","16582720"," I had no idea what that did."
"16585150","16585550"," Okay. "
"16595660","16597939"," So yeah, what we'll do is we'll wait for this to sell off."
"16598300","16598860"," I will."
"16599060","16600119"," I'll wait for this to sell off. "
"16600980","16602380"," And I'm going to be looking for support."
"16602700","16606080"," My call right now is I'm looking for support at..."
"16609619","16613720"," I don't know if we get to my call as we trade down at least to 441-70."
"16614439","16615040"," At least here. "
"16615040","16616939"," If this firms up, I'll buy it."
"16617660","16622020"," If it doesn't, though, 440 is the word, bro."
"16624180","16625240"," 440 is the word. "
"16640540","16646300"," Brian Watt has a new video talking about the new single stock leveraged long and short ETFs coming"
"16646300","16647680"," soon to a brokerage near you."
"16647860","16648520"," Ooh, I'll have to watch it."
"16653550","16656250"," Yeah, we have the money put ratios haven't hit since COVID crash. "
"16658770","16660610"," I think that we still..."
"16660610","16663050"," I still think we see 4,000."
"16663090","16663610"," I think we do."
"16664810","16669750"," I think if we don't see 4,000, now we'll see it by summertime at some point. "
"16671270","16673849"," We just can't have everybody fucking long when it happens."
"16674330","16675390"," Oh, short when it happens."
"16675490","16679050"," We have to have people long in the market for us to go down there. "
"16680930","16684869"," We're going to make you a believer that we're not going down."
"16698240","16700220"," Yeah, I'll have to watch his video."
"16701599","16702700"," I haven't watched anything. "
"16703200","16703320"," Nothing."
"16703680","16704640"," I knew that he came back."
"16704779","16707140"," Somebody told me they came back on to YouTube or Twitter. "
"16709580","16712860"," And I haven't had a chance to check back in and watch any of his videos."
"16713080","16714460"," So all you know what I'll do is I'll do that tonight."
"16715180","16717759"," I'll crack a fucking fat whiskey and I'll watch one of his videos. "
"16718040","16718900"," So I love that fucking guy."
"16719060","16728910"," He has a badass just wearing out all these fucking calls."
"16728910","16730369"," You guys all buying calls in here?"
"16730369","16731410"," Is that what you guys are all doing?"
"16731950","16734830"," Are you guys all buying fucking all these bags for people?"
"16740240","16741619"," You guys buying everybody's bags?"
"16744200","16744980"," Let's see what we can..."
"16744980","16746220"," Let's see what we can..."
"16746220","16747960"," Let's see this better. "
"16749580","16750720"," Here's that VWAP."
"16750860","16756009"," That's a 4.41.92 right here."
"16756710","16757590"," Some buyers down here. "
"16757869","16759910"," 4.41.70. Same place."
"16759910","16760990"," Just below VWAP."
"16763810","16770630"," These buyers here, not as many down here as they were earlier at 4.40. Maybe we don't get that"
"16770630","16770849"," low. "
"16773259","16774080"," Some buyers stepping up."
"16774320","16777540"," 4.41.74. I'm interested in that one now."
"16777660","16778920"," Looks like some of the buyers are stepping up. "
"16790880","16792760"," Yeah, let's check out what Brian wants video."
"16792940","16793440"," I like that guy."
"16794300","16795300"," The guy's a fucking master. "
"16806620","16807240"," Oh, did he go out?"
"16807380","16814460"," Did he go on any rants saying that the market's not going to sell off during earnings season?"
"16821830","16824610"," It's been almost two months and people are still calling for another low."
"16825830","16827490"," Yeah, I don't think we can get it."
"16827630","16830990"," I think when you're talking about..."
"16830990","16838630"," I don't think we see 400 until after fucking all that bullshit with the early May, early May"
"16838630","16842250"," FMC and OpEx. "
"16847410","16849830"," Did he say that though?"
"16850250","16851270"," Oh, buying people's bags."
"16856130","16857010"," Turn around Tuesday."
"16857650","16860810"," So you're talking about turn around Tuesdays. "
"16867630","16869690"," Brian Watts is both trader and educator."
"16870150","16870410"," Bad ass."
"16871350","16872950"," Seek him out on Twitter and YouTube. "
"16873930","16874810"," I think he goes by the real..."
"16874810","16876470"," I think his Twitter handle is the real Brian Watt."
"16877350","16879670"," And I think his YouTube channel..."
"16879670","16882050"," I'll post the link on Twitter to his YouTube channel."
"16882630","16883890"," They got a lot of respect for the guy. "
"16886360","16888620"," And I've defended him publicly on Twitter."
"16889680","16890840"," People were ripping on him."
"16891040","16897520"," Matter of fact, there were a lot of people ripping on Brian that I was a little pissed off for"
"16897520","16898240"," ripping on him. "
"16901060","16902560"," Nice little squeeze here."
"16922400","16923120"," It's interesting."
"16923440","16929560"," We're squeezing right now and uh 4.46s for the 20th are not going up that much. "
"16931850","16933810"," Not for the squeeze they were going through right now."
"16934970","16941650"," I just went up like three cents on some 4.46s. Found at 91 cents."
"16943990","16945530"," They're only worth 94 cents. "
"16946670","16948670"," No love from the dealers."
"16949070","16953990"," They don't want to fucking pay for that squeeze right there."
"16954710","16956290"," They're not printing for me. "
"16970050","16971350"," Marketmakers don't want to hear it."
"16983070","16985590"," I'm up to 95 cents on those calls right now."
"16987130","16988450"," About them at 91. "
"16990610","16992150"," And they're going back down again."
"17008870","17010210"," They're breaking even again."
"17010950","17012590"," He's fucking motherfucker. "
"17012750","17014550"," These motherfucking..."
"17015270","17019130"," These fucking marketmakers are scumbags."
"17019450","17020070"," These fucking dealers."
"17022270","17024330"," That nice little squeeze right there. "
"17024770","17025170"," Ain't paying."
"17025270","17025670"," Ain't paying."
"17025850","17026210"," Shut up. "
"17026210","17027250"," Now up to 98 cents."
"17027470","17027570"," All right."
"17027910","17027970"," Sweet. "
"17029570","17031150"," Up to 99 cents."
"17035610","17037290"," These fucking dealers, man."
"17037450","17038510"," There's fucking scumbags. "
"17039690","17042030"," Put that little rip right there and made 10 cents."
"17044630","17044790"," Up."
"17045110","17046030"," Down to a dollar now. "
"17048750","17049650"," He becoming."
"17057370","17058250"," Keep printing."
"17058610","17059190"," Keep going up. "
"17067650","17072510"," I'm almost 10% on those, but it's not enough."
"17096200","17097200"," We'll have to cut these loose."
"17133760","17136500"," We'll have a little rip right there and made 10 fucking cents. "
"17137500","17138420"," This little rip right here?"
"17139180","17139640"," 10 cents."
"17141020","17142080"," That's fucking bullshit."
"17144120","17145640"," That is utter fucking bullshit. "
"17150420","17151700"," 10 fucking cents."
"17163270","17163790"," I'm outraged."
"17168320","17169720"," That was not worth the time and energy. "
"17171520","17172380"," Let's see right here."
"17172380","17173680"," This is another buy in here maybe."
"17178140","17180500"," Let's see if there's another buying opportunity in here. "
"17183000","17184820"," Let's see if we can get another bounce right here."
"17190840","17193360"," It's coming into the 2 o'clock hour."
"17219690","17221390"," It's more of a yawn fest right now. "
"17221530","17225310"," Even that little rip right there is only worth 10 cents, which is complete fucking bullshit."
"17225990","17233230"," It was almost down to 4.4.2.79. So it went up a fucking 10 points and it didn't"
"17233230","17233770"," pay dick."
"17235790","17236890"," It's a fucking. "
"17237450","17239290"," It's un-American, dammit."
"17240550","17246980"," It means not as many people are buying calls right now."
"17254850","17255470"," Yeah. "
"17265420","17266040"," What?"
"17266220","17266720"," I don't think we got."
"17271030","17276450"," Let me talk to you about, let me, uh, taste that's why I think we go down and talk about"
"17276450","17276810"," it right now."
"17294160","17297480"," So one good thing is we're above the 50 now, which is bullish. "
"17298080","17307900"," So we are bullish in the market in terms of, uh, we were able to break above the 50A moving"
"17307900","17308000"," average."
"17308520","17311800"," Or today's, today's action puts us above the 50A moving average."
"17312280","17315020"," I don't know that it's bullish in the greater context. "
"17315800","17318920"," Like I don't, it doesn't look bullish in the greater context."
"17319160","17322420"," What it looks like, uh, is the same, right?"
"17323140","17324700"," So the key would be this."
"17324920","17327840"," So this, and my fact, this is a good time to bring up Brian Watt, right?"
"17328480","17336400"," And his point is that you have to want, you have to wait for, uh, earnings, uh, to, let me"
"17336400","17338520"," make this like a, like a forebanger here. "
"17339580","17341520"," And we'll, we'll put this one."
"17341600","17343000"," Let's just say, put this one right here."
"17344240","17344680"," Okay. "
"17345220","17346420"," And we'll throw this away."
"17347320","17348740"," We'll come, we'll bring that back in a minute."
"17349900","17356220"," Uh, but the key would be this is that, and Brian Watts, now we sold off eventually in last earnings"
"17356220","17356520"," season. "
"17356520","17357160"," What happened was this?"
"17357520","17361060"," We, last earnings season, uh, we held the market."
"17361380","17363400"," So we held in here, right?"
"17363400","17366940"," And then when the major players were done, we actually sold off."
"17369330","17372830"," And right here, if you see, see this, see this one right here, right?"
"17373070","17375210"," This was, this was the peak market, right?"
"17375370","17379450"," We traded up into the market and now we're rotating, right?"
"17379590","17383510"," We should rotate in here and then eventually sell off, right?"
"17384550","17387370"," Uh, so the question becomes, why do we think we're going to hit 430?"
"17387750","17392870"," Because I think it's normal and natural, uh, during the starting season for us to come up, go up"
"17392870","17394370"," and down, right?"
"17395010","17399190"," And then the wiki and I talk sometimes about, uh, will we actually hit like below 430?"
"17399950","17404910"," Uh, and you need an event more so than a hawkish fed speaker to get us below there. "
"17405370","17412970"," Or it'll happen after, uh, those events after the risk is done with, uh, with OPEX and with, uh,"
"17413030","17419110"," FMC, uh, then you would actually see the move down, the tag it, and then you actually make that,"
"17419230","17419890"," that rip higher."
"17420530","17422570"," Uh, this actually isn't bullish or bearish."
"17422710","17427730"," The reason you say sell of your rip is because, uh, we should be in this defined trading zone. "
"17428330","17437990"," Uh, so for, for earning season for major players, uh, major components of the S&P 500, uh, you're"
"17437990","17440130"," going to trade in this kind of a zone here."
"17441110","17443430"," So when you trade up here, you take a short position."
"17443730","17445590"," When you trade down here, you buy a long position. "
"17446390","17449270"," Um, and even here, this is 435, right?"
"17449830","17455530"," So if you're, if your trading area is here, if this, let's just say this is your trading area, 448,"
"17456030","17456450"," let's call it."
"17456790","17460650"," Let's call it a, um, let's call it, let's go high."
"17460830","17462150"," Let's go to 460 or 450. "
"17462730","17463810"," Let's say that's our trading zone."
"17464450","17467350"," And let's say our lower range is 435, right?"
"17467490","17473250"," We all know that when we trade in these zones, that you're going to have, uh, quick tests, right?"
"17473470","17474190"," That's why I gave us that, right?"
"17474390","17476530"," Expect quick test at some point down below."
"17477590","17480650"," You'll get the, uh, the test out of 430, then we'll come higher. "
"17480950","17483690"," You know, we can trade above here briefly, and then we'll come over."
"17484130","17489430"," Uh, and I, and I test to Brian what Brian Watts has to say about, um, the market during earning"
"17489430","17489830"," season."
"17490190","17494210"," Uh, typically you will see us trade in a range, right?"
"17494470","17497290"," And then typically you'll see us, uh, give it up over time. "
"17498050","17499710"," And that, and price doesn't matter when you give it up."
"17499830","17500290"," It doesn't matter."
"17500690","17502450"," Dude, fucking price doesn't, price doesn't matter. "
"17503470","17508470"," Uh, what does matter is, um, the brat, the market brat does fucking matter."
"17508610","17509870"," Every fucking time it matters."
"17510470","17512250"," Wait a minute here, hold on a second. "
"17512370","17513310"," What the fuck is this?"
"17514150","17516230"," Oh, I'm on the, uh, pencil right now."
"17517330","17518650"," You know, it does fucking matter."
"17518870","17520550"," And even though we're catching a bit today, right?"
"17520670","17522170"," This is, this is consult, not to punish. "
"17522450","17525490"," This is, um, sideways movement, right?"
"17525630","17526970"," We buy and sell and buy and sell."
"17527610","17528590"," And this takes time, right?"
"17528830","17532510"," This mark, these markets take time to roll over, right?"
"17532650","17534450"," You can see how it takes time to roll over here."
"17534450","17537750"," You can also see this earnings season, right?"
"17537950","17540050"," Took time and then eventually you get the roll over. "
"17540550","17544350"," Um, and you can see just this time right here, it is when."
"17544930","17549510"," This is, uh, 22nd December all the way until January 18th."
"17549690","17553150"," So this can take some time for us as an area to trade into. "
"17553930","17556890"," So you get a quick retest down below at 430."
"17557290","17563370"," It's not out, so if you're trading in this zone, you should expect to trade to buy dips down below"
"17563370","17567810"," there and sell rips above this 450 at some point or 445."
"17569450","17571030"," We know this resistance at 445. "
"17571030","17573310"," We know the top should be somewhere around 450."
"17574150","17576630"," We'll trade in here over the next week or two."
"17576750","17580150"," But to say, if you guys just look back at normal, any other time, right?"
"17580730","17582870"," When you come up here, you end up selling it. "
"17583110","17583630"," Does that make sense?"
"17584390","17585770"," When you come up here, you sell it."
"17585930","17587390"," When you come up here, you sell it."
"17587550","17589670"," When you come up here, you fucking sell it. "
"17590190","17591990"," Now it can take time for it to sell down."
"17591990","17595770"," And you can see even in here where we sell down, price didn't matter."
"17595990","17599330"," We didn't actually trade, we traded sideways the entire time. "
"17599490","17604470"," So even in this rotation, it's not going to matter if we sell down at 430 or if we fucking"
"17604470","17605250"," just sell down at 435."
"17606010","17608390"," Does it matter if we sell down at 420 or 400?"
"17608750","17614410"," You're just looking for the breadth to go away in the spot in which it will at some point."
"17615150","17622850"," This is all, this is all I'm tracking for breadth to come down to a viable area. "
"17624130","17627310"," Which should keep up the market is to an extent, right?"
"17627470","17628270"," Should prop the market up."
"17628670","17635970"," Is the ability for companies like Tesla to report and for companies like Apple to report and Amazon"
"17635970","17636590"," to report."
"17637010","17643630"," Any of these heavy hitters for the market, they're not going to sell the market off. "
"17644150","17647230"," They're not going to, if they were going to sell Apple off or Tesla off, they would have done it"
"17647230","17648450"," over the past month, month and a half."
"17649430","17652770"," They're going to give them for where they are right now."
"17653030","17658210"," There's an implied move on their earnings that analysts put out and they, as a matter of fact, will"
"17658210","17662590"," look at, will bring up Apple as an example or Tesla will bring up Tesla. "
"17663930","17670890"," So what you'll notice on Tesla is every earnings season, you'll see this, right?"
"17674010","17685310"," Every earnings season, as we get closer, you'll start to see Tesla get positioned where"
"17685310","17692050"," the market makers are going to bet that there's a move this way or down this way by a certain"
"17692050","17692550"," percentage."
"17692950","17697070"," And so you'll start to see the positioning of a ticker that's going to have their ER."
"17697490","17699310"," And that's what Brian wants the statement is, right?"
"17700010","17705450"," The market makers, the, the, the, well first the analysts go out there and they analyze, they get"
"17705450","17706190"," it wrong, of course. "
"17706750","17707750"," They always get it fucking wrong."
"17708590","17712070"," But the market makers will try to move, believe it or not."
"17712570","17719470"," The banks, everybody, all these real, the real money will try to keep stabilized to an extent where"
"17719470","17723530"," they think the move is going to be afterwards, depending on what the report is. "
"17723630","17725690"," Sometimes we get surprised reports, we go through the fucking moon."
"17726390","17728490"," Sometimes we get surprised reports, we go to the fucking depths of hell."
"17729150","17732170"," But they try to, they try to position a company. "
"17732350","17740650"," And that's what Brian Watts' thought processes is, is that these, these heavy headers in the"
"17740650","17743850"," indexes, they're going to get a chance to report."
"17745330","17751850"," They're not going to, they will sell over time getting to their earnings report, either down to"
"17751850","17752930"," bring them where they think it should be."
"17753590","17756750"," And they'll bring it up to where they think it should be, depending on the ticker, right?"
"17757870","17759150"," Because they don't want a fucking surprise. "
"17759690","17762710"," They don't want to, they don't want to show up and have them come out and say something."
"17762950","17769730"," Now with that being said, with that being said, here's an example, T."
"17772300","17780900"," Now I think T has more time to go down, but there are a shit ton of people saying, look,"
"17781220","17782500"," T just dropped down here."
"17783520","17789300"," So there's a bunch of people buying calls on T because is this where their implied move was going"
"17789300","17791160"," to be for their ER report?"
"17791900","17796260"," If their ER report ends up being outstanding, I think their earnings report is this weak. "
"17796880","17799920"," You could see a fucking rocket ship on T, right?"
"17800040","17805320"," So this is unusual heading into an earnings report to see a move like this."
"17806580","17807260"," Not normal."
"17810460","17812260"," Let me see, I'm bringing this up for like a year. "
"17813020","17814480"," Yeah, so that's not normal in here."
"17816440","17819200"," For T to be positioned like this heading is their earnings report."
"17820140","17825500"," So when you see moves like that, regardless of what the news is, there's an anticipation, right?"
"17825660","17828560"," They sell this down as it just goes sideways after their ER report. "
"17829400","17833960"," Tesla over this time period, so you trade it higher, which made it down, and we're kind of right in"
"17833960","17835260"," the middle right now for Tesla."
"17836480","17841380"," And they're waiting for a move higher or a move lower on some kind of surprise or disappointment"
"17842200","17843640"," heading into their ER report."
"17844500","17851260"," So the implication would be that we're going to be range bound in here because you're buying dips"
"17851260","17852120"," and selling rips. "
"17852980","17855380"," And so do I think we can trade higher here?"
"17855700","17856260"," I don't know."
"17857160","17858900"," We trade higher than the bell, possibly."
"17861680","17867760"," If anything, I bet this gets pinned waiting on ER report. "
"17868080","17870500"," I bet you they're waiting on fucking Netflix report tomorrow."
"17870760","17874020"," If Netflix is kick ass, you'll see us trade higher."
"17874300","17877280"," We'll blast off to 446, 448, 450. "
"17879140","17882360"," And if it's not fucking awesome, I can tell you this."
"17882360","17889720"," If fucking Netflix is fucking ER sucks, they'll drop spy back down a port per test of 430 or 440."
"17892440","17896700"," Right, and they'll build it up for Teslas, and then they'll drop back down if Tesla sucks. "
"17897340","17901060"," If you start to get some bad fucking reports, though, if you get a Tesla battery port, Netflix"
"17901060","17904180"," battery port, they will fucking start selling this market down."
"17904320","17905280"," I guarantee you in a minute."
"17906000","17911720"," So as we come into this earnings season, the other thing that you'll see is you'll see muted moves"
"17911720","17912360"," in the spy. "
"17912780","17921680"," You'll see more sideways action typically until these reports come out."
"17922120","17925940"," Like generally, you're not going to see like 100 point moves or 300 point moves down."
"17927000","17932960"," You'll notice sometimes earning seasons that they'll be quick moves sometimes right after the bell"
"17932960","17933300"," to 415. "
"17934400","17937680"," You'll see an impact that swings spy up and down a little bit."
"17938240","17940500"," But oftentimes, you'll see like great earnings."
"17940680","17944900"," You'll see great ERs are some companies, and you won't see spy move a lot. "
"17946220","17947500"," It just won't."
"17948140","17949940"," Or at least commonly, you won't see it recently."
"17950300","17956300"," You'll see more stable trading action in the spy. "
"17956580","17963800"," So if you're long calls here, I guess the question becomes do you take this long into the bell on"
"17963800","17964520"," some kind of news?"
"17965140","17965880"," I don't know."
"17966640","17968160"," I know what the answer is to you."
"17968840","17970180"," I'm sitting on some puts here. "
"17970280","17975000"," I guess I guess that puts their anticipating a bad move from Netflix to some extent, right?"
"17976060","17977120"," That would be the implication."
"17978760","17980380"," Let's take a look at who's reporting today."
"17986260","17988280"," So I'll see who's reporting today. "
"17998700","18000480"," I've got to say we've got Netflix."
"18001360","18002540"," These are big heavy hitters."
"18002760","18005600"," You saw IBM's today, right?"
"18005820","18011540"," And we also saw the Dow get a bit this morning, probably anticipating if we get a bad report from"
"18011540","18013080"," IBM, or at least try to stabilize it. "
"18013760","18019380"," Interactive brokers, Martin Hancock, Whitney Stride, Rexford Industrial First Horizon, Pacific"
"18019380","18021040"," Western United Community Bank."
"18021460","18023600"," It's a little more bank reports today."
"18024120","18029860"," We got some bank reports from where there was a, I think it was $6 million was bought on some"
"18029860","18031180"," on XLF this morning. "
"18031660","18034160"," So they're expecting some good reports today and tomorrow morning."
"18034680","18037980"," Then we've got Tesla on Wednesday, and we've got CSX."
"18038140","18038640"," That's a big one. "
"18039240","18041320"," And then later on, we've got AT&T, right?"
"18041460","18042200"," This is what I was talking about earlier."
"18042680","18043940"," We got Snap on Thursday."
"18044740","18047000"," Boston Bear Company under Performer over time, right?"
"18047480","18047960"," We've got Dow. "
"18048140","18050620"," These are all big, big heavy hitters in the Dow all week long."
"18051260","18055440"," They got Verizon and AMEX, some more XLF stuff heading into Friday."
"18058750","18060250"," So these can impact markets, right?"
"18060390","18062210"," We know Netflix can impact the market. "
"18062970","18069870"," We know if Netflix has a bad report, and you'll probably be some panic heading into the close for"
"18069870","18074810"," what Netflix, so even if we rip up higher, you might see some of this kind of action with Netflix."
"18075390","18078250"," And then if Netflix has a good report, then they should go up."
"18078970","18082550"," I'm not sure what it might take on Netflix, what I think they're going to do in their ER. "
"18084390","18085010"," Tough to say."
"18085010","18087150"," I've stopped playing ERs."
"18087410","18089070"," I used to play a lot of ERs. "
"18089170","18089670"," I don't anymore."
"18091530","18093050"," We can look Netflix up."
"18104180","18107040"," Trading is low today as 332.45, right?"
"18107580","18108180"," Nice trade higher. "
"18109140","18113340"," Typically, you'll get people take, you know, they panic, and they'll take, you'll see something"
"18113340","18118860"," like, because you're not always, but oftentimes you'll see is you'll see some weakness into the"
"18118860","18119120"," close."
"18119680","18121180"," That's a call buying right into the close."
"18121660","18122960"," It's going to be people looking for a dip to buy. "
"18125460","18126740"," What's my take on Netflix?"
"18127300","18128440"," That trade is fucking over."
"18129920","18131240"," That's my take on Netflix."
"18132540","18134520"," Is 348 a fair price for Netflix?"
"18135800","18136640"," Hey, kind of. "
"18137300","18140320"," I don't like that they're not producing as much content as they once were."
"18140420","18144620"," I don't like they have so much competition like, like they didn't have before."
"18146780","18148500"," What do I think about Netflix?"
"18149680","18155380"," I think that even if Netflix has a good report, I think you're still going to see another, take the"
"18155380","18156340"," money and run type thing. "
"18156780","18158180"," Let's say Netflix has a good report."
"18158200","18164420"," You might see some, some a rip to 377, and then I think it continues to sell down as, as"
"18164420","18168900"," some believe, not maybe not the summer, but I think it continues to sell out over time."
"18170260","18171420"," I think that trade's over. "
"18172140","18179200"," And when I'm looking back here on where the banks were, there's where they bought in down way down"
"18179200","18180680"," here at 298, 289."
"18181980","18184800"," So they still haven't completely sold out of their position."
"18185900","18192860"," So if they have a battery port, I would tell you that easily they could sell down to, oh, wait"
"18192860","18196620"," a minute, easily, easily they could sell down to 300. "
"18197240","18201660"," Caught a 50 point move down, easy on Netflix."
"18202220","18204360"," So we'll look at Netflix real quick on book map."
"18206720","18208540"," Uh, we get spy selling off slightly. "
"18209760","18211020"," Let's take a look at Netflix."
"18211880","18212320"," We're going to Tesla."
"18226710","18231410"," We'll load up, uh, six hours of Netflix. "
"18233130","18234170"," I'm back to Tesla real quick."
"18237310","18238590"," Looks like we're getting some selling."
"18257250","18266210"," So you have that one little price target here, two price target number two, price target number"
"18266210","18266490"," three. "
"18274150","18276890"," We'll see if these, uh, remain the same down here."
"18279950","18282190"," 441 70, I think is the place."
"18285370","18287650"," Let's see if they're still down there if they pull the rug. "
"18289930","18292470"," They're still down here, 441 70."
"18299930","18302210"," The buyers have weakened down here at 440."
"18312400","18313840"," It looks kind of rolly, doesn't it?"
"18315680","18316540"," Looks like distribution. "
"18320850","18324030"," It is interesting to see call buyers stepping in back here."
"18326070","18331120"," It looks like a young, young fest to me."
"18332400","18334420"," Looks like take the money and run into the clothes. "
"18334860","18335340"," We'll look at Netflix."
"18340270","18342870"," More sellers than buyers on Netflix right now."
"18347770","18348910"," Look at the whole day. "
"18350910","18352370"," Beautiful bounce up above."

"18401320","18403240"," holding just below 3%. "
"18403860","18411230"," Peace and support here at 330, 320, 300 though."

"18418010","18420470"," He buys some 300 P's."
"18425390","18432540"," Good report, 380."
"18434380","18440000"," If you just do a strangle or a straddle, either one would work. "
"18441320","18450150"," The strangle, you'd get 380s and 300s."
"18450630","18451630"," Pretty big spread, right?"
"18453850","18454590"," And Netflix."
"18458250","18460770"," If you're going to do a straddle, do a farther out. "
"18461270","18464350"," If you're going to do a straddle, you'd do a farther out."
"18464350","18466250"," You'd do it like a month out at 300."
"18467290","18468550"," Start, excuse me, in the money. "
"18469230","18471010"," You'd do in the money for a month out."

"18473650","18475350"," I don't like straddles on ERs. "
"18475830","18476630"," I like strangles."
"18478070","18480610"," I think the fucking sucks is the interest it leaves."
"18481670","18482570"," So you don't really get paid. "
"18482710","18490690"," I think my favorite trade on an ER report is a strangle that's a call spread and I've put spread"
"18490690","18493290"," like a month out, 380 and 300."
"18494670","18499030"," Do a month out of 380c and a month out at 300p."
"18499790","18503130"," And you cut one side loose, depending what the report is. "
"18504070","18505790"," Then you don't have to deal with the fucking interest leaving."
"18508360","18509860"," Maybe make a call for Netflix."

"18653470","18655210"," There's some fucking money right there."
"18656010","18658450"," Well, sometimes that can be someone buying too. "

"18667140","18670400"," Did this happen in currency trading all the way up to QWTR?"

"18687120","18688040"," Let's see what they're saying. "
"18694460","18696840"," The next thing I was going to do was answer is they recover."
"18697100","18700380"," So they keep shorting Twitter to the school board."
"18700540","18701200"," What's going on here?"
"18701780","18702360"," Let's see what they're doing. "
"18702360","18702840"," Talking about."
"18705360","18709920"," Someone wrote, should I accidentally sold a million shares at market instead of one thousand?"
"18709920","18710840"," Sorry, my bad."
"18712520","18714140"," I thought I had fat fingers. "
"18717360","18718260"," Fucking hilarious."
"18723000","18723980"," See what he's saying."
"18724880","18726020"," See what he was saying. "
"18726760","18735240"," Yeah, you'll see this and this is intended to."
"18737120","18738860"," Oftentimes you'll see dips like this."
"18738860","18741080"," This is intended to take your shares away from you. "
"18743300","18747260"," If you've got some stops, cleans out stops."
"18763920","18766120"," Makes him wonder who's over here doing the buy."
"18766360","18769460"," Someone looks like someone's trying to accumulate some shares right now. "
"18770240","18771160"," This would be my guess."
"18771500","18775360"," If I had to guess, someone was trying to accumulate shares at a decent price."
"18776560","18785000"," This is probably, if I had to guess, this is probably someone trying to make a bid on Twitter for"
"18785000","18785740"," controlling interest. "
"18786640","18788020"," I don't think this is Elon dumping."
"18791750","18795330"," I think this is a competing entity."
"18807420","18809000"," I didn't see Dwac. "
"18810260","18811920"," The DMAC dump."
"18814660","18817300"," Ooh, Dwac fucking rocket chipped."
"18817840","18820760"," You know, this is an interesting thing, right?"
"18820980","18830000"," So what an hour ago I told you guys, if the wrong company fucking buys Twitter, you'll see another"
"18830000","18832780"," company rise from that, right?"
"18834840","18838020"," Or you create another social media company. "
"18838640","18842680"," If you saw like a Disney type entity take over Twitter, it would be the death of Twitter."
"18843560","18846240"," So maybe there's a bid in Dwac over that."
"18848060","18854240"," Jesus, Dwac went from 46, 75 to 50 and pinged out wild. "
"18860170","18860650"," Interesting."
"18877860","18879720"," Meanwhile, we're not paying attention to the spy."
"18879720","18881400"," I'm over here fucking looking at Twitter. "
"18883040","18884140"," Let's see here."
"18884320","18885520"," Is this real divine here?"
"18885800","18885980"," Yeah."
"18887680","18888220"," Nope. "
"18888500","18890340"," I'm looking for this 4, 4, 1, 7, 0."
"18890600","18891300"," Ain't buying it."
"18896110","18899010"," Fucking bulls getting fucking wrecked on the spy right now."
"18901230","18902230"," Just fucking. "
"18903510","18906430"," The fucking market makers have like a vacuum cleaner out."
"18906650","18907510"," Just suck it up."
"18908290","18910570"," All that money from that options chain. "
"18917270","18923110"," Yeah, I took a look."
"18923250","18929080"," I just saw two million dollar block purchase sold."
"18936360","18947810"," Chase once paid like three times a day to get"
"18947810","18949410"," a time there, Chase, but it'll come to you. "
"18952730","18958670"," Yeah, I don't know if it's I don't know what we were talking earlier in stream."
"18962850","18965410"," You know, if some of the company gets a hold of Twitter, right?"
"18965670","18969530"," If if like you have telling you, if like Google gets a hold of Twitter, that's the fucking death of"
"18969530","18969750"," Twitter."
"18972210","18972890"," Promise you. "
"18973970","18975390"," It'll be like going to fucking Disneyland."
"18975950","18977450"," Everybody better put a fucking smile on."
"18980300","18981000"," You know what I mean?"
"18981540","18983160"," That's what happened to Reddit to an extent, right?"
"18986460","18989920"," In Reddit, they basically walked around and just started fucking and hammering. "
"18992640","18997360"," And they got and they the user base now is very much like if you were living in China."
"18999680","19004360"," And that same thing would happen to Twitter as well to an extent."
"19005680","19009580"," Put your fucking mouse hat on, put your fucking smile on, enjoy the ride. "
"19011400","19016600"," I don't and I don't know that Twitter can get out of it."
"19017600","19018240"," I don't know."
"19018240","19022060"," I don't know that Twitter can I don't know that Twitter will make it out alive out of this. "
"19025170","19027950"," I think that I think the poison pill was the wrong move."
"19029550","19031950"," I think the poison pill is going to come back to bite him in the ass."
"19035800","19037240"," I think it's fucking for sale. "
"19039840","19044540"," As a company at least, you know, I don't think it'll ever be what it was from this point forward."
"19045940","19050180"," But it is interesting to see the way see catch a bit there for the brief moment, right?"
"19066730","19068310"," Spies still trading down a little bit."
"19068470","19070990"," We have a still a week for 42 63. "
"19071870","19074970"," We'll see if the buyers stick around down here."
"19075210","19077270"," 441 70 if this gets picked up or not."
"19078890","19084390"," If not a price target 440 down below here, maybe into the bell. "
"19093180","19095960"," That was a beautiful I wish I could have bought that dip at 45."
"19098340","19100840"," What about that fucking dip all day long at 45?"
"19109440","19110340"," Elon just tweeted."
"19112660","19114600"," You're looking to find out what Elon just tweeted. "
"19124080","19125860"," You know, that brings up something."
"19126140","19131280"," So if you guys have so I've got so I've got a tweet deck on over here, right?"
"19132120","19141860"," If I had two people, a social media platforms"
"19141860","19145880"," policies are good at the most extreme 10% of the left and right are equally unhappy."
"19147020","19147660"," Fucking right. "
"19149990","19151730"," Does Elon listening in?"
"19152130","19155210"," Is Elon Musk listening into my fucking live stream or what?"
"19156430","19163260"," Is he fucking listening into my shit?"
"19164980","19168060"," I think he's listening into the fucking live stream."
"19168360","19169520"," Elon, are you out there?"
"19170160","19172380"," If you're listening in, bro, say something in the chat."

"19378920","19381420"," He's got a long ass road ahead of himself."
"19381420","19385100"," If he buys it, it's not a fucking easy road, right?"
"19385520","19387700"," It's not an easy fucking road."
"19387880","19390080"," A social media platform's policies are good. "
"19390840","19393960"," If the most extreme 10% left and right are equally unhappy."
"19394340","19394540"," I agree."
"19395240","19395780"," I like that. "
"19396480","19398480"," It's not an easy fucking thing to deal with."

"19437050","19438230"," Not a whole hell of a lot, right?"
"19440320","19442000"," Just draining people on the spy."
"19442220","19454100"," Two crewed features, settling one of two, it's about 56 down about 5.2%. Yep."
"19462860","19465060"," Yeah, that's a very fair fucking point. "
"19467970","19469310"," It's not just one side."
"19469490","19472550"," That was my point earlier today is that it's not just one side."
"19472550","19475130"," There's like, there's bad shit fucking crazy. "
"19476130","19479870"," When I listen to some fucking people on the left talk, and then I listen to some people on the"
"19479870","19483830"," right talk, I'm like, what the fuck are these motherfuckers saying?"
"19485430","19492370"," They're both being fucking fed by the same fucking psycho, not psycho, well, yeah, psycho patty,"
"19492510","19497370"," but corporations and fucking in governments, like they're both being fed this shit pie."
"19498630","19499770"," It's fucking wild."
"19500570","19501590"," Yeah, it's fucking wild. "
"19507720","19514060"," Ooh, Apollo entering the bidding war confirms that 54 got shares too low."
"19514220","19516740"," Yeah, I saw Apollo entering the bidding war."
"19517100","19518100"," That was this morning, right?"
"19522220","19523160"," Yeah, I don't think it mattered. "
"19523400","19525460"," I think that was part of that conversation from earlier."
"19525720","19527820"," So I think if I had to guess."
"19529580","19534800"," So if you trade currency, it doesn't happen as often here, but this will trigger cells, right?"
"19534940","19537040"," So someone can accumulate shares. "
"19538360","19540460"," And then I think the Pandora's box is fucking open."
"19540460","19544680"," I think that you're going to get interested parties."
"19544880","19546680"," They're now going to bid this shit up. "
"19549280","19555600"," And now, so even if you said, oh, Elon's out, he's not buying Twitter."
"19556260","19558220"," Now it doesn't, now the cat's out of the fucking bag."
"19558460","19563560"," Now you're going to get two, three, four parties interested in a hostile takeover. "
"19564080","19569500"," And unless all those parties go away, I think you're going to start to see these moments, right?"
"19569500","19571500"," You'll see a dip buy."
"19571680","19573040"," I think he even had it written here, right?"
"19573220","19574880"," Buy anything that dips below here."
"19575340","19578280"," You guys, this was on here, I've just been on here for a couple days now, right?"
"19578520","19579160"," What do I write?"
"19582320","19583800"," Buy anything below. "
"19584920","19585880"," Big fucking letters."
"19588650","19589030"," Why?"
"19589530","19591990"," Because they're still interested parties in here."
"19592810","19594110"," So these assholes are long. "
"19595750","19597050"," And they just did it again."
"19597550","19599130"," They just fucking did it again."
"19600310","19604390"," So they're all, I don't know who these assholes are, but Elon's one of them. "
"19604390","19605830"," He's not an asshole, but he's one of them."
"19606310","19608670"," And you probably have Apollo, like someone just mentioned."
"19609970","19611670"," And you probably have some other bettors, right?"
"19612410","19613630"," They want to get into this action. "
"19615050","19616750"," Some of them, I wish I got this to him."
"19616890","19617550"," Man, I should have put a limit."
"19617670","19619030"," I should have put a limit buy order in. "
"19619830","19622810"," I would have, I would have, I would have, I would have, I would have, I would have, I would"
"19622810","19623650"," have, I would have, I would have, I would have, I would have, I would have executed."
"19624890","19625270"," Goddamn it."
"19627290","19627710"," Goddamn it. "
"19629630","19631050"," I should have just had a fucking limit."
"19631050","19635250"," I just should have just had a fucking limit buy order there, because you know it's going to happen."
"19636190","19637670"," And it just fucking did. "
"19642510","19644010"," This is a brush if you want to know."
"19644530","19645570"," This is not bearish."
"19646350","19647450"," No, this is very bullish. "
"19648310","19652070"," This is, this is fucking, this is fucking people looking for a better price."
"19653750","19654370"," These are fun."
"19654490","19656710"," This is when, this is when big banks dip by in each other. "
"19660950","19663250"," This is when the big boys get to start playing with each other."
"19666940","19667520"," Dude, what a good tweet."
"19668620","19668940"," I love it. "
"19669400","19671420"," 11 minutes ago, he hasn't tweeted all day long."
"19676620","19679640"," He was posted by a co-sell letter, yeah."
"19680300","19684380"," Yeah, that new Apollo, I thought, mentioned it this, I think they have that at that news on Apollo"
"19684380","19687980"," that was came out at like seven this morning or four a.m. or something. "
"19703650","19704650"," I agree with that."
"19705750","19707130"," That's my one question too."
"19707270","19712310"," I think someone mentioned it on, I think someone mentioned it on Twitter or somewhere. "
"19712570","19718910"," Someone said why bother, someone said why bother spend spending 50 60 or not 50 60 billion."
"19720350","19725830"," I wanted to, I don't know what the billions are, but why bother, why bother buying, or buying"
"19725830","19731570"," Twitter for let's say $5 billion or fucking whatever the fuck price is when you can just build your"
"19731570","19734650"," own social media platform."
"19735130","19739130"," I'm sure you get some, I'm sure you get a flock of people that would come to your social media"
"19739130","19739690"," platform. "
"19752010","19754850"," Unless there's some smart engineers out there that are saying no."
"19757630","19760870"," Unless there's some engineers, some smarter people saying they're not going to leave Twitter."
"19762790","19764930"," Maybe that's, maybe that's part of the plan, right?"
"19765130","19770550"," You let Twitter get bought by a Google and then you go create a new, a new platform like Twitter,"
"19773160","19775120"," 50,000 likes already in that tweet. "
"19777480","19779180"," He just pissed off both sides too."
"19779460","19780100"," I love it."
"19780740","19786700"," He just pissed off the far left and pissed off the far right in one tweet. "
"19788660","19789520"," I love it."
"19789660","19790380"," I love the troll."
"19791640","19792680"," I love it. "
"19792920","19797820"," I love that troll."
"19800420","19801740"," I love the trolling."
"19802780","19803840"," I fucking love it. "
"19809340","19810480"," I love the fucking trolling."
"19811500","19812220"," It's not easy."
"19812540","19816180"," He has to be able to do that and I don't know how you do that. "
"19816380","19817440"," I know it's going to be difficult."
"19820420","19822480"," You have to piss off the fucking crazies."
"19822600","19827860"," You can't let the fucking people that tell you the earth is flat have fucking rain over Twitter. "
"19830960","19837920"," And you can't have, I don't know if I'm going to say the other side, but you know, you can't"
"19837920","19839940"," have, you know, you just can't have crazies."
"19840280","19840880"," They can't run Twitter."
"19841020","19841300"," I'm sorry. "
"19841420","19841760"," I apologize."
"19853670","19855030"," Has DWA seen dead?"
"19855790","19856130"," I don't know."
"19856310","19856490"," Let me look. "
"19858010","19858570"," Is it on life support?"
"19859390","19861090"," I don't know."
"19862070","19863790"," I think there's a play in DWA see."
"19864170","19868690"," I think, I think like, so the talk to we had earlier, right, the things that you need to, you"
"19868690","19878510"," do need to know is that the things that you need to know is that Twitter is going"
"19878510","19881830"," to more than, there's a high chance that Twitter gets bought. "
"19882710","19885610"," The chances are going up more and more every day that Twitter gets bought."
"19888770","19892110"," That enough companies will show interest at this point that it's going to get bought."
"19892110","19894430"," So my view is that Twitter will go up. "
"19896010","19900230"," My view, although also is that these companies are going to try to get the best price they possibly"
"19900230","19900670"," can."
"19901030","19902050"," How do you do that, right?"
"19902570","19908610"," If I own, if I own 10 million shares already and I do a quick 5 million dump, I can"
"19908610","19910550"," probably go back in and scoop up 30 million shares."
"19911050","19915190"," So you're going to see these moments, just like we had today, we've already seen these days, we've"
"19915190","19917030"," already seen these days in the past, right?"
"19917410","19922150"," So I think the viewpoint you have to have right now, right now, just currently, without any other"
"19922150","19928790"," known information, is you're going to have wild swings down and wild swings high until a deal is"
"19928790","19929010"," made. "
"19930230","19935070"," I think the poison pill for Elon, all the guarantees at this point, someone's going to try to buy"
"19935070","19935230"," it."
"19938570","19940690"," Now, let's say every deal falls through."
"19941410","19944750"," That doesn't matter because these assholes are now accumulating this dump. "
"19946250","19947350"," So they want to get paid."
"19947990","19950690"," So even if the deal doesn't go through, they're still going to try to pump it up."
"19951910","19954250"," To get paid, and then they'll short it down. "
"19954730","19957670"," So some heavy hitters in here on Twitter right now."
"19958350","19965050"," Now, with all that bullshit said, with all that other bullshit said on Twitter, right?"
"19965670","19968450"," The other thing that matters is who buys Twitter."
"19969070","19970670"," It does matter who buys Twitter. "
"19970910","19974350"," And it also makes you think about like DWAC."
"19974730","19981130"," Now, I'm not a supporter of DWAC at all, but if you're a market participant, you would have to"
"19981130","19989270"," guess that DWAC should catch a bid because it would be an alternative to like a Google buying"
"19989270","19989550"," Twitter."
"19990370","19995950"," And you would also expect that if Elon loses the bid, that he's more than likely going to start or"
"19995950","20000210"," back a DWAC or even start his own social media company. "
"20001150","20003670"," So you would see a bid in DWAC as well."
"20004350","20011050"," So you're going to look for a bid in Twitter to per hostile takeover, and you're going to look for"
"20011050","20019710"," a bid in more than likely to DWAC as well as an alternative, a more, what'd you call it, a"
"20019710","20025130"," justified alternative to Twitter, just based on who buys Twitter."
"20026370","20030050"," They will be an alternative for Twitter users. "
"20031710","20038310"," Now, what that also says is, or to me, is even if Elon loses the bid, I think he should"
"20038310","20040870"," start his own social media platform."
"20043150","20044050"," I think he should."
"20046230","20049550"," I think either way, the fucking the board is gone off Twitter. "
"20049730","20050850"," I think their jobs are done."
"20052230","20055790"," I think the board's days are limited and numbered."
"20056550","20060890"," I don't think for a minute that any of these companies that buy Twitter, I'm going to let"
"20060890","20068450"," themselves be held hostage by some fucking Twitter board, for their higher ups or any one of their"
"20068450","20068870"," middle management. "
"20070150","20074170"," And there's another replacement engineers."
"20074550","20076630"," All there's replacement engineers for Twitter all over the place."
"20076650","20077710"," They'll take that job in a heartbeat. "
"20079450","20082330"," Now, does that help make Twitter a better place?"
"20082530","20082830"," Probably not."
"20084310","20087030"," But don't worry, they're going to squeeze it for every last dollar they can."
"20087030","20092070"," And just like Facebook, your dad and granddad and grand, great-grandfather will stay on Twitter. "
"20095870","20097470"," Does it get so shelved in history?"
"20102350","20103850"," Yeah, I don't know much about WWAC."
"20104370","20105590"," I don't follow it at all."
"20106190","20109170"," I know what it is, but I can see why it would catch a bid. "
"20111530","20116790"," If you start to add all this stuff up and who's going to end up buying Twitter, it would make"
"20116790","20127090"," sense that WWAC would catch a bid to become more, I don't know if there's a word for it, but"
"20127090","20128970"," I'm losing that word right now."
"20131410","20135330"," So just kind of watching this shit show go on and inspire right now."
"20136990","20138930"," I'm not really interested in this. "
"20139130","20139810"," I haven't taken a trade."
"20140730","20142370"," I took some puts over here and over here."
"20143150","20144630"," I haven't taken any calls. "
"20144950","20148210"," I took a call in here for two minutes for like 10 cents."
"20149950","20153990"," It wasn't worth the time and the pay for this kind of risk for this kind of move."
"20154210","20156390"," I don't know what the print has been on this so far. "
"20164260","20173040"," This almost looks like it's going to trade sideways into the bell and wait for the Netflix."
"20173040","20177020"," Is he going to wait for the Netflix?"
"20179940","20182500"," All comments from the Fed's Evans saying in the backs."
"20183120","20189420"," Fed raising rates to 2 rates by 225 basis points over this year. "
"20191630","20196170"," It's not letting C and the need for Fed hikes larger than 50 basis points as Evans."
"20196950","20201030"," 250 basis point hikes to help get there could make sense."
"20204020","20208080"," Evans saying we'll be able to make a judgment on whether inflation pressures are easing until the"
"20208080","20208760"," end of this year. "
"20210300","20212280"," Yeah, Elon's going to, if he gets this."
"20212300","20216460"," This is comfortable with the rate hike path this year that includes 250 basis point hikes."
"20217940","20222600"," Getting to that, his neutral range at two and a quarter to two and a half percent the year end. "
"20227620","20230360"," So Fed's evident of non-voter supports raising rates."
"20230680","20233440"," 225 BPS over the course of this year."
"20233440","20237280"," 250 basis point hikes to help get there could make sense. "
"20251580","20253860"," I don't have any need to get out of those puts."
"20254080","20254760"," I'll hold those puts."
"20255920","20259360"," So those are an extension of the long wins. "
"20260300","20261600"," So they're free trades for me."
"20261700","20263140"," I just hold them until they go worthless."
"20264880","20265860"," They paid for themselves. "
"20268640","20271480"," So I'll hold them until expiration on Friday."
"20271940","20274000"," They protect any longs that I take at this point."
"20277110","20282010"," So this player is going to hold them into Wednesday and Friday regardless of where we go. "
"20283250","20289370"," And if this market rolls at any point in the next three trading sessions, they should print for me"
"20289370","20289850"," if I'm long."
"20290870","20295310"," Now that leaves the question of where we go from here."
"20297310","20300090"," And a lot of it is based upon these reports, right?"
"20301910","20304870"," If we trade higher or not and set ups. "
"20305570","20307330"," Now we are, let's have a little conversation."
"20307590","20311390"," We'll talk about where we are."
"20313090","20314550"," Let's we'll clean all this up here. "
"20315950","20317470"," Let's talk about where we are."
"20322460","20324100"," So the volatility trigger."
"20324380","20326500"," Now we can drop below the volatility trigger at any time. "
"20327780","20329260"," My shit gets so fucking dirty."
"20330840","20334940"," I try to leave this stuff behind so that we have a record of it, but today this is getting"
"20334940","20335720"," kind of fucking messy."
"20337380","20340780"," So this little green line right here, you can see this resistance, right?"
"20340980","20341680"," This is resistance. "
"20342760","20345040"," So this is the resistance we've had going back past week."
"20345360","20347220"," So let's just be aware of where we are, okay?"
"20348080","20349900"," Be conscious of where we are here, okay?"
"20351820","20354260"," So last time we traded up here, we rejected, right?"
"20355420","20356200"," We did it again."
"20356600","20357080"," We were rejected. "
"20357600","20358840"," We did it again, right?"
"20359100","20363000"," And we are technically for not knowing anything we are rejecting."
"20363420","20364860"," Now this looks pretty bullish, right?"
"20364860","20368680"," This looks like this bear flag is now turning into a bull flag."
"20369180","20371800"," So I'm not against us going up here. "
"20372640","20375060"," You can see the bull flag here, right?"
"20378720","20380420"," You can see it right in here."
"20383200","20385600"," Now, so I've got a free trade, right?"
"20385940","20393290"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to leave, see this nice beautiful bear flag is now turning"
"20393290","20394150"," into a bull flag."
"20394230","20395190"," It's had time to consolidate. "
"20397070","20398510"," So the question is, do we go up here?"
"20398750","20399610"," Do we roll over here?"
"20400310","20406870"," So I'll leave these, what I'll do is I'll leave these puts on for Friday, right?"
"20409210","20413510"," I'll leave these puts on for Friday because if we roll this market over between here and Friday at"
"20413510","20418050"," any point, these are going to print, right?"
"20419870","20421310"," So sell the rips always, right?"
"20422050","20426550"," Now the one cool thing is that where we have a volatility trigger here, we are above it technically"
"20426550","20427310"," right now."
"20428410","20436490"," Technically when we trade above a volatility trigger, if this holds, this is the start of a bullish"
"20436490","20437030"," regime."
"20437790","20443510"," Regardless of the market breadth is sold off, this is the beginnings here of a bullish regime. "
"20444070","20449590"," We have less risk of volatility once we trade higher than the ball trigger."
"20450370","20451350"," I want you to be aware of that."
"20451350","20456130"," So we should trade up over time. "
"20456710","20460970"," We should see smaller moves in the next coming days into Friday."
"20461910","20469700"," The only thing that I would comment on this, how do we trade below this is if we have a"
"20469700","20470760"," bad-earring ER reports."
"20471320","20476760"," If that flicks is a bad ER, you are going to see a return. "
"20476760","20482320"," It was Treasury Department issuing their latest fact sheet on agricultural trades in Russia"
"20482320","20485160"," sanctions don't include agricultural exports."
"20487200","20491680"," So that a reopening trade with the masks is back on again, just heads up on this."
"20492240","20496980"," We just had one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine. "
"20497460","20501380"," Nine calls come in for almost the fucking million dollars."
"20502040","20505840"," November 18th, 25c on AAL."
"20506640","20509540"," So huge calls coming in on AAL right now. "
"20510520","20513660"," So just so you know, this is bullish up here, right?"
"20513820","20520660"," This above this ball trigger, we should see decreased volatility, and we should see sideways,"
"20520660","20522340"," upwards movement here."
"20523240","20527140"," But this is still all based on having good ER reports."
"20527680","20530800"," You have to have good ER reports to see the spy trade higher. "
"20576910","20585130"," So with that said, leading into tomorrow, if Netflix doesn't have a bad ER report, you're going to"
"20585130","20585930"," expect us."
"20586250","20588010"," This would be your volatility trigger."
"20588110","20594690"," Being above this, you'll see less volatility, and you will see the markets move up and over and"
"20594690","20595870"," trade higher from here. "
"20596050","20600270"," You'll see support line now at 440 down below here."
"20600550","20607030"," You would actually see if we don't sell off today, you'll see tomorrow support or excuse me, you'll"
"20607030","20607510"," see support."
"20608690","20611610"," With your resistance was here at 4.4, you'll now see that become. "
"20612170","20619290"," You'll see 440 become support, and you'll see 450 be the price target up here."
"20620730","20626550"," You'll see it become 450, and you'll see R1 probably be 445 and R2 be 450."
"20627670","20632730"," If we continue to get good ER reports, you'll see us begin to trade up to this 450. "
"20633450","20640330"," Now, if Netflix has a bad ER, that does rub off on other tickers, right?"
"20640330","20647290"," You know that if you start to see tech show you bad reports that you are going to want to"
"20647290","20651190"," hear S1, can they move these around up here?"
"20651530","20652050"," Where's S2?"
"20653910","20659770"," This is S1 down here at 435, and S2 is down here at 430."
"20661830","20670470"," Now, the key about this is that the key about this is that if you, let's see here, the key"
"20670470","20672650"," about this is this is all predicated upon."
"20673030","20677690"," If this is bullish, this is all predicated upon having good ERs. "
"20678010","20681750"," If you have a bad ER, if you start to see some of these banks come in, and they're like,"
"20681850","20683090"," we suck, we're not making any money."
"20683690","20689850"," If you start to see Netflix have a bad, if you start to see Netflix have a bad ER report,"
"20690410","20693030"," you'll see us slip below this volatility trigger."
"20693750","20697410"," Now, if we slip below this volatility trigger, volatility is back on again, right?"
"20698350","20705270"," You will see volatility pick back up and selling more aggressive selling to the downside. "
"20705690","20710470"," That's like when you got, you guys see, notice when you see like if you see like AMD have a"
"20710470","20714150"," bad ER, you'll start to see other chip makers have a bad ER."
"20714970","20718510"," So heading into the close today, it is 254 PM."
"20719070","20726250"," So heading into the close today, you will see a flip tomorrow calling for positive gamma for being"
"20726250","20726630"," up here. "
"20727030","20732590"," But the only key is us being an earning season, we can easily trade higher and lower than this"
"20732590","20733290"," volatility trigger."
"20733730","20735010"," All you need is a bad report."
"20735810","20743390"," You have calls coming in right now on Tesla as well, April 22nd 1035C for $1.1 million. "
"20745690","20752110"," So I'm going to hold on to my puts here, right, that I paid for with calls today, in case"
"20752110","20754030"," we trade below this volatility trigger."
"20754450","20760250"," And then I'm going to look to long above here from this point, because we're above the vol trigger"
"20760250","20765710"," at this point, we're above 442, you're going to look to be buying dips at 440, unless we get bad"
"20765710","20766330"," ER reports."
"20767210","20774070"," So at this point, just hang tight to wait for the Netflix report, and that'll tell you if you can"
"20774070","20775390"," take this long or not. "
"20781890","20783230"," Oh, no, I'm still on my puts."
"20783610","20788530"," I'm on puts for 430s and no, that's what I think that's all I've got."
"20789010","20789830"," Let me take a look. "
"20795330","20805250"," Yeah, I've got, I've got 430s for, yep, I've got 430s for April 20th and April 22nd, and then I've"
"20805250","20806450"," got some calls as well."
"20825520","20830080"," Netflix is trash, the geputes, bank ER, no, bank ERs are not done."
"20832040","20833020"," They're not done. "
"20833940","20834980"," Everybody does though."
"20835720","20837580"," I come at 437 people who less"
"20837580","20846600"," than learned vol trigger will stay below"
"20846600","20851440"," because we're above the vol trigger now."
"20852480","20858480"," Well, the positive negative, the vol trigger stays below. "
"20858940","20861340"," If we trade below it, we'll be figuring volatility again."
"20863300","20865720"," Money center banks, not regionals."
"20866780","20868000"," Yeah, not regionals. "
"20868300","20869940"," I'm just in 440p now."
"20870440","20871900"," No chance they make any money."
"20872340","20876700"," 50 seems like it could be a target of 447. "
"20877400","20880240"," Puts getting wrecked and puts only and got murdered."
"20881200","20883580"," That's a big banks that matter are done."
"20885360","20888340"," Think back, that's a big banks matter are done. "
"20889320","20897380"," Yeah, so big banks that matter are done, but you guys know that if you have good ER reports, they"
"20897380","20899720"," don't always lift until after, right?"
"20900420","20906320"," So if you start to see bolstering by regional and smaller banks, there was some calls that came in"
"20906320","20909900"," on XLF today this morning and put those out there for you."
"20911900","20915060"," So let me take a look at where those XLF calls are."
"20918810","20922090"," XLF had one order today. "
"20922430","20923810"," I'm putting it up right now on Discord."
"20924530","20931090"," So we had one order today, May 20th, 38.5c for 3.6 million dollars."
"20931750","20937990"," So you had the earlier banks reporting, right?"
"20938670","20944850"," And then you get more banks, smaller banks reporting, and there's a bid here at XLF. "
"20945250","20946050"," XLF going up."
"20946230","20948870"," So we do have some more banks reporting."
"20949130","20955200"," Sometimes you won't get the print the first expiry on XLF or on the banks themselves, but you'll"
"20955200","20956600"," get a print further down the road. "
"20957680","20961180"," So that's what I'm basing when I'm talking about the banks reporting today."
"20962500","20963180"," That's XLF."
"20963780","20966420"," Someone thinks that XLF is going to continue to go up. "
"20967720","20969000"," That's why I'm noting that."
"20971160","20973100"," NTNX for 10 million dollars."
"20973280","20974660"," She fucking Christ. "
"20978140","20978720"," NTNX."
"20987500","20990220"," A little bit of a bid in spy currently."
"20991260","20992740"," More spy calls being bought. "
"20993240","20994560"," More Tesla calls being bought."
"20996800","20997380"," NTNX."
"20999140","21000780"," That was at 11 a.m. right?"
"21003990","21005450"," Yeah, damn, look at that rip. "
"21006530","21007490"," That was right here."
"21008190","21010490"," Went from 27 to 27 63."
"21011470","21012290"," A little bit of a rollover. "
"21015070","21016490"," Gonna keep my eye on this one."
"21018130","21020090"," This is a good ticker trade too."
"21021310","21022190"," I like this ticker. "
"21029860","21032720"," Kind of like sell them, but by the dip and sell the rip, right?"
"21034680","21035600"," Oh, shit."
"21039320","21041960"," I just got rid of all my charts by logging in."
"21042240","21047820"," Argentina reporting the February capacity utilization at 64.3%. I got a log out. "
"21047840","21053600"," Argentina for one hour now, one hour to the U.S. cash equity close the Dow near session highs at"
"21053600","21054800"," 400 points."
"21055040","21058800"," The S&P mini is also near the highs of the afternoon up close to 60 handles."
"21059580","21067200"," And as that composite up 260 points of Russell 2000 higher by close to 2% on the day, bond"
"21067200","21071500"," yields, particularly the short and under the curve finishing near the highs of the day, the 210"
"21071500","21077800"," spread wider by nearly six basis point, and pressing by nearly six basis points back to 34 basis"
"21077800","21078100"," points. "
"21078100","21078960"," This is nice."
"21078960","21080260"," Short rate."
"21081080","21090520"," The 10 year yield holding about 2.9%. Spy trading higher. "
"21092300","21095500"," Same place looking for 445 20 and then 446."
"21096500","21098520"," See if they can work its way up there into the bell."
"21122160","21125300"," Nice little nice little squeeze higher here on the spy. "
"21126560","21130900"," See if we can actually hit that 445 or 446."
"21190050","21191070"," What are you guys saying?"
"21203930","21205490"," Yeah, no, I'm not looking to play."
"21206030","21207390"," So I'm not looking to play. "
"21207910","21210170"," It's like it's I'm not looking to play."
"21212370","21216150"," I'm not saying that there's that the components of XLF are those small banks."
"21216750","21219910"," I'm saying that you get all of banks mooning. "
"21220070","21222430"," You'll see it rubs off on other tickers."
"21222430","21223550"," It's like a sympathy trade."
"21224670","21225750"," So I'm implying. "
"21227070","21228490"," I'm putting something I got murdered."
"21230110","21232490"," A P profile and MP."
"21233070","21236410"," Next thing it's just a short cover rally that I can't like handy wrong carry. "
"21237050","21239270"," Yeah, I've been in the XLF calls for June 35."
"21239670","21240490"," Pretty big bag here."
"21241270","21244270"," So a lot of my MP when I was around 60 by more 35. "
"21250310","21255490"," I have my student loans not to pay someone else's to already tax the debt."
"21255750","21256570"," Yeah, that's kind of weird."
"21256730","21264290"," You know, the thing that's bizarre to me on that whole thing is that I have a feeling that"
"21264290","21268190"," Democrats are going to get fucked in the elections, the Senate elections. "
"21269930","21275690"," Whether you agree or disagree with them, they promised all kinds of stupid shit and all they get in"
"21275690","21277790"," the getting was like, we're going to fix your roads for you."
"21278150","21279850"," Like there's I think a lot of there."
"21279990","21284850"," I think a lot of Biden's voters wanted like help with school loans. "
"21286050","21291710"," Wanted help with the BLM stuff."
"21292470","21295270"," And then they even just reform."
"21297770","21301650"," But also there's a bunch of shit that people or their voters are asking for that they didn't get. "
"21305500","21306960"," It's like buyers are more or something."
"21312180","21315680"," And then the craziest part is now they've got inflation, right?"
"21317680","21320520"," Now you've got inflation on couple of medical bills, right?"
"21320860","21322760"," Health care, they didn't get any health care stuff."
"21323020","21323680"," No help with health care. "
"21323760","21325060"," No help with college loans."
"21327560","21328180"," Police reform."
"21328480","21331480"," That's how I'm getting rid of the police, just even just some kind of reform they didn't get any of"
"21331480","21331640"," that. "
"21334000","21335960"," I don't know what they did get."
"21336160","21341720"," I guess they are getting filled back America, but filled back America is not geared towards their"
"21341720","21342100"," voters."
"21345530","21349230"," We've always trying to down, but if we have balance, we could range for a while. "
"21349910","21355010"," I didn't move wildly in really good smart bank earnings, free health care, free health care, free"
"21355010","21356010"," student loan debt payment."
"21356430","21358090"," He has up to stuff they're asking for, right?"
"21362410","21363610"," Universal base can come."
"21364190","21365150"," I'm not entertaining you that stuff. "
"21365490","21369430"," I just, I'm just looking at it from respect of what was two things I'm looking at."
"21370130","21378510"," There are two things that I'm concerned about are the impact on markets."
"21379250","21385530"," So you'll, I think, I think you get people that are run against saying claiming that they'll bring"
"21385530","21387310"," inflation down, the market's going to go all time high. "
"21388570","21389490"," Which they can do."
"21399780","21405140"," I guess my concern is what do they do with the markets at that election in the next election."
"21411480","21414920"," I mean, if we meet her, that's why I owe me this full of fucking platinum and fine. "
"21415120","21416120"," We can pay for all that shit."
"21420350","21430050"," Yeah, the health care system, I might view the health care system kind of fucked up."
"21430570","21432890"," We have insurance and it's bullshit. "
"21434090","21438070"," If I had paid money for insurance and got what I paid for, I wouldn't have a problem with it."
"21438310","21441770"," This like, that involves my auto insurance my home insurance."
"21442310","21445890"," Like, oh, if I can, I don't get paid, I can't make claims on anything. "
"21451000","21452040"," Yeah, objectively speed."
"21452260","21454000"," Pete Preston is what I'm talking about."
"21454160","21455040"," The Dems look weak objectively. "
"21456260","21459840"," And that's the key is that there are people who are, you know, like, if you're, if you're a"
"21459840","21461300"," Republican Democrat, it doesn't matter."
"21461920","21467740"," The key is, is your, your guy or gal doing what they promised you, right?"
"21468000","21476440"," So if you're Republican, did your promises that you gave, did you at least attempt at least made an"
"21476440","21481020"," attempt to get those things passed or drum up support for those things?"
"21481180","21488480"," The other weird thing too, is that I don't see a lot of, like soapbox standing to, to win seats"
"21488480","21489120"," for the Democrats."
"21489560","21489960"," I'll kind of bizarre. "
"21499390","21502330"," Kevin seems everyone believes the market will roll over heading into FMC."
"21502970","21504730"," I think you get a roll over into FMC."
"21504870","21509930"," I just don't think that you get, I don't think that you get the 4000 into FMC. "
"21511190","21515390"," What I think is that you get so I think to look at it from the summer when we talked,"
"21515570","21515670"," right?"
"21516990","21517890"," At the opening, right?"
"21517950","21523550"," I was trying to make an explanation to you is that they're not going to murder the fucking market."
"21524170","21528570"," They're not just going to fucking shoot it in the head until all of these big tech, like the"
"21528570","21531570"," companies that pulled up the market right now report."
"21533490","21539410"," But it does line up with FMC and OPEX, may OPEX. "
"21539890","21546130"," So I think you get the roll off in the markets into those dates, but you don't see the bloodbath"
"21546130","21546990"," until after."
"21547610","21552410"," I think Mickey always likes to say like a week after you see the bloodbath of everybody bought"
"21552410","21556650"," everybody buying those puts."
"21556750","21558430"," You got to wait for those to come off the market first. "
"21558970","21561530"," Now the point is that everyone's well hedged, right?"
"21561690","21562770"," Now I'm well hedged right now."
"21563290","21566970"," So I've got hedging for myself into Friday, right?"
"21566970","21570450"," Wednesday and Friday, I've got put hedging in case we trade lower."
"21570870","21573810"," If Netflix has a shitty fucking ER, I'm covered. "
"21574690","21575550"," They're paid for."
"21575710","21576130"," They're free."
"21577250","21579250"," They're at the same time buying calls as we head up here. "
"21581530","21583430"," As you should too, right?"
"21583570","21587110"," Or you should be selling puts on the market being overly hedged down at 4000."
"21588470","21591470"," And then you wait until they become cheap and you buy more puts."
"21592030","21593510"," Up here, puts are cheap again. "
"21594230","21595470"," So puts are starting to get cheap."
"21595670","21596670"," So you start to hedge yourself."
"21602390","21604530"," But we will see new levels tomorrow. "
"21605130","21607110"," Now that vault trigger will stay lowered now."
"21607250","21608750"," We're above the vault trigger at this point."
"21609670","21611490"," So that should imply less volatility. "
"21612790","21618770"," That doesn't mean that the VIX doesn't stay high just because of FMC like looming in the"
"21618770","21619030"," background."
"21619830","21623730"," It'd have to be another event for aggressive selling at this point."
"21628570","21634250"," It's by now making its way higher to 4411, trying to retest the highs at 4428. "
"21634890","21642450"," We'll see if it can hit that price target above 44.5. Take this off here."
"21643230","21646630"," 45 and we have 446 above here as well."
"21647430","21648510"," The sellers are up here. "
"21652370","21657530"," So you'll probably see tomorrow if I'm thinking here what you're going to see is you're going to"
"21657530","21660470"," see a support level down here at 440 flat, right?"
"21661170","21665270"," To be a support level and 450 above."
"21666390","21667390"," Let me get rid of some of this."
"21668030","21670590"," It's not really not really helping. "
"21683570","21693460"," You're going to see 450b top over here and you're going to see this BR trading zone for"
"21693460","21697140"," the rest of the big reports that we have coming out."
"21698560","21708540"," Now that doesn't mean you don't head yourself for battery ports in case we fade lower or buy calls"
"21708540","21709280"," if we go higher."
"21710020","21712980"," If you come up here, though, you're going to be selling this market down as well. "
"21713880","21718800"," So this is what I would expect to spot an account with something like this and we're above the vol"
"21718800","21719500"," trigger right now."
"21719500","21728040"," So anytime we trade below this 445, 442, I believe, you will be back to a regime of violent moves"
"21728040","21728980"," down below here."
"21728980","21733080"," But this trading here could go nice and slow as well. "
"21733980","21737300"," I did this big violent move up here, but you're not going to see that."
"21737700","21740460"," You'll see actually last volatility where we are."
"21740680","21743600"," That's the sideways and up trade over time. "
"21744460","21751120"," Then we trade down into OPEC and FMC."
"21756580","21759160"," Now with all that said, we are entering season."
"21759520","21761360"," So all you fucking need is one battery port. "
"21761560","21767540"," Trust me, if fucking Netflix sells down violently in the in the close today, you're going to see a"
"21767540","21770580"," move down in the spy as well in kind."
"21771140","21776980"," If Tesla sell the news, you're going to see continued selling in the spy and in the queues."
"21778500","21783440"," If Apple gives a battery port, you get what I'm saying is if Amazon gives a battery port, then"
"21783440","21785640"," you'll end up seeing continued selling. "
"21785980","21790660"," And if all these companies give good reports, you'll see profit taking at some point down the road"
"21790660","21793240"," lining up with FMC and OPEC."
"21794100","21803860"," Now trading the 444.50 new high on the day, we know that sellers are above currently at 445"
"21803860","21809620"," or excuse me, 450 and 445 excuse me, 446."
"21812640","21818160"," We'll take a look and see if these sellers are still above here and you can see them right here"
"21818160","21821300"," at 445 and 446. "
"21824220","21831480"," Now let's look above and see where the next level is and you can see it up here at 450."
"21832680","21835040"," Now there's a block of sellers hiding in here."
"21835160","21837100"," You see this down below right above this 446. "
"21837920","21839680"," 447 ish right there."
"21839940","21841940"," We see them bring it back up right there."
"21842640","21844360"," You can see this wave of sellers. "
"21844660","21847360"," Sellers are becoming weaker as we trade higher."
"21848520","21850980"," So 450 would be the next target."
"21852160","21861950"," Now then you've got 453 light resistance at 455 and 457 and then the big boys up here sellers at"
"21861950","21862210"," 460. "
"21877270","21879410"," And we'll see if we can tag this up here."
"21880170","21881850"," See if we can tag this 445."
"21883290","21888530"," Now trading at 4487 and 446. "
"21890650","21892490"," If we can get up to 446 up here."
"21900150","21902470"," Let me show both of these spots above here."
"21908500","21909980"," I'm going to sell some calls here. "
"21910120","21910320"," Hold on."
"21952020","21952780"," Right there."
"21954940","21965870"," Now trading at 444.93. See"
"21965870","21967270"," if we can make it all at 446. "
"21986480","21987840"," Oh you're going to hear us."
"21988020","21988980"," You'll be seeing Twitter tonight."
"21988980","21990480"," 45 minutes down to the US cash. "
"21990480","21992820"," I could close it out more than 500 points."
"21993020","21994520"," We're seeing an acceleration here to the upside."
"22000900","22001840"," Nice tag above here. "
"22001980","22004140"," Maybe the lows of the day down more than five bucks."
"22004700","22007800"," Bomb yield remain higher led by the short end of the US curve."
"22008040","22013080"," The 10 year at 2.915%. Is that 446 tag above?"
"22028760","22031640"," Yeah I bought those calls at like 90 fucking cents. "
"22031960","22033900"," They're still only at a dollar fucking 30."
"22034700","22035860"," They're not that good."
"22035860","22037120"," It's not that good of a rip. "
"22043670","22046270"," It's a better fucking squeeze to 446."
"22057120","22063860"," Now trading at 445.15. See if we can get that 446 out of this."
"22065140","22090140"," 445.17. Watching"
"22090140","22091540"," calls coming on SPX. "
"22095420","22097640"," Calls coming in on Spy and Apple."
"22128310","22129090"," Give me that fuck."
"22129270","22130010"," Give me 446. "
"22133230","22156590"," They're at 445.24. I'm"
"22156590","22157370"," not getting shit."
"22157650","22158210"," I'm up like 25."
"22158630","22158630"," I did. "
"22158770","22159250"," I'm up fucking."
"22159650","22160370"," I'm up for it."
"22160490","22160550"," No. "
"22160770","22163270"," Now I'm down."
"22163530","22164650"," I'm down until 30 now."
"22164830","22166290"," It's $1.37 at one point. "
"22168220","22169880"," And I was at 90 fucking cents."
"22171280","22172100"," I was up like 40."
"22172240","22173800"," 40% at one point on those calls. "
"22176370","22180890"," I'm not getting fucking rips out of this right now."
"22184740","22187700"," I needed to fucking trade to 446 to be honest with you."
"22191560","22193280"," I'll have one last little leg up here. "
"22207620","22208620"," Alright I'm fucking out."
"22208940","22209520"," Fuck that noise."
"22212940","22214720"," A lot of risk for a little bit of pay. "
"22216060","22217920"," For all of this fucking consolidation."
"22219340","22223360"," For all of this consolidation, 446 is just printed."
"22224540","22226360"," Only printed 40%. "
"22226360","22229200"," Actually I didn't even catch that."
"22229340","22230700"," I don't think I caught that much off there."
"22230860","22232660"," I think I caught 30 or 40%. "
"22232660","22235200"," But it was like 40 cents or something."
"22236160","22237960"," So that wasn't that good for this move here."
"22238280","22239580"," For all that consolidation bullshit. "
"22278830","22279350"," Do you think?"
"22279510","22283210"," Let me know in the chat if you think that we can go higher at 446 because I'll re-enter."
"22284630","22285630"," I don't know if we can."
"22291780","22293320"," So we'll look and see if this holds. "
"22296250","22297610"," It looks like it's bouncing off."
"22325970","22328130"," I've got some lined up if we catch a bounce here."
"22343480","22344640"," Yeah this wasn't even worth. "
"22350860","22353500"," And I want to see if we can get that last tag right up in here."
"22390310","22394350"," Man Tesla just fucking around all day long at 10.30 huh?"
"22395010","22395790"," Like nothing."
"22399510","22400090"," Just brutal. "
"22401230","22402490"," Tesla just capturing."
"22405340","22407880"," Then we can get 10.50 tomorrow on Tesla."
"22409820","22412720"," Somewhere right up in here where this market is right here. "
"22413480","22414920"," Tesla wants to be gapping."
"22435950","22437410"," Squeeze it up into the close."
"22438970","22440430"," Go to 446. "
"22442210","22444530"," Go to your fucking hole and get up there."
"22460160","22461520"," Go to 446."
"22468360","22469980"," Call's coming in on misfit. "
"22470220","22471240"," Apple in the queues."
"22472680","22474760"," Misfit 8.19. 320 C."

"22545890","22549010"," So I'm going to put a tip up on it at some point with crypto. "
"22549270","22552970"," I don't know if it's up yet or not but I don't think it is but I'll talk to my"

"22596650","22599970"," They're gonna be running anywhere from 9 to 12 trades this year. "
"22600130","22605390"," It's at Captain's trades and then we've got at Captain's Alpha and Captain James on Twitter."
"22606290","22610410"," We have half an hour left the rest of the day at 35 minutes for the rest of the day"
"22610410","22610750"," today."
"22611110","22617110"," Spy trying to make new highs on the day trying to get up to 4.46. We'll see if we"
"22617110","22618350"," can blast off and touch it. "
"22618750","22623210"," Just touch it a little bit and we'll see if we can actually get up here."
"22623610","22626750"," Some sellers starting to step in now at this point in the day."
"22627470","22629290"," The question would be now we got half an hour left. "
"22629710","22631710"," What is the plan for tomorrow?"
"22632830","22638210"," We've got big tech and all these companies that hold up the indexes that are going to be reporting"
"22638210","22642090"," in the coming weeks and the markets being held aloft."
"22642470","22650010"," Everyone is well hedged down to the FOMC and OPEX for May."
"22650930","22652690"," The question becomes do we trade higher?"
"22652970","22653470"," Do we trade lower?"
"22654210","22655890"," It's all because we're running season. "
"22656250","22659370"," It's going to depend upon what takes place in these earnings, right?"
"22659510","22663990"," We got to see what these companies are going to be reporting."
"22664710","22668430"," If you see Netflix report bad, you're going to see the market sell off."
"22668590","22672450"," If you're going to also see it impact other tickers depending on what their report. "
"22672750","22675130"," We know some of the guidance has been pretty good."
"22675670","22679170"," We also know that some of their outlooks are kind of a mixed to neutral bag."
"22679490","22682210"," When if that President Bostick beginning his interview on CNBC. "
"22683010","22683990"," Oh boy."
"22687030","22692070"," Bostick is going to start talking about a beer town on CNBC right now."
"22692290","22696710"," Be aware that tomorrow we've got later tonight and tomorrow. "
"22697330","22705370"," We have fed speakers speaking in the coming two days so we could see some volatility from now into"
"22705370","22706950"," later and tomorrow afternoon."
"22707770","22712910"," Even though we're trading if you're a bear, I don't understand why you pissed off up here."
"22713370","22716710"," This is the place for you to be buying puts not to be buying put. "
"22716830","22718170"," You don't be buying puts down here."
"22718790","22723150"," So if you're buying puts up here for the markets to roll over a little bit, if the market were"
"22723150","22727170"," to trade sideways for the next few days, two days in the next two weeks wouldn't surprise me."
"22728090","22734670"," We've got Bostick speaking on CNBC just said I am in the same area as my Fed colleagues on"
"22734670","22735990"," inflation rate hikes. "
"22736790","22738810"," He's just quoted on CNBC as saying that."
"22739530","22740050"," Hilarious."
"22741670","22746030"," I'm in the same area as my Fed colleagues on inflation and rate hikes. "
"22750090","22752190"," Still so much uncertainty out there."
"22752670","22754810"," It was saying he's putting the pump on the market right now."
"22757730","22760290"," So you see the pump in the market currently today. "
"22761250","22763710"," We are in ER in earnings season, right?"
"22763710","22767710"," And we are we still bring, variably we're still trading sideways."
"22768430","22773170"," If you look at a month, not quite a month, but we're still in a range, right?"
"22773370","22774710"," We still like you look back."
"22775190","22781090"," So Feds, Bostick, a non-voter, a little bit more circumspect here just saying that he is basically"
"22781090","22784790"," in the same area as many of his Fed colleagues on inflation and rate hikes, but due to the"
"22784790","22790870"," increased uncertainty out there that he is uncomfortable declaring just how fast they expect to get"
"22790870","22794330"," to the neutral rate or whether or not they'll need to go beyond that. "
"22794530","22794990"," That's hilarious."
"22795950","22802370"," It was softer tone than we heard from Hock Bullard yesterday."
"22803770","22805550"," And Bostick's a hawk too. "
"22805690","22806750"," I don't know if you know that."
"22806930","22808390"," Bostick's a fucking hawk as well."
"22809670","22815770"," So we're getting some very very davish comments out of a hawk and known hawk from the Fed. "
"22815930","22825160"," He is a non-voter by the way, but it is hilarious to hear that hear him being bullish right"
"22825160","22827500"," now on the market."
"22851810","22852590"," Campaigned to the close."
"22852830","22855590"," How many minutes we got left is 3.20. There's still a half an hour left. "
"22858430","22859850"," A little bit of consolidation right here."
"22860170","22861390"," We'll see if we can trade higher."
"22861730","22862470"," Now let's look at something. "
"22863210","22868350"," I think the high end is, if we're looking at this right here, right?"
"22868830","22875490"," We've got resistance at 4.46. I think this is a stretch getting up here at 4.46. If you're"
"22875490","22879530"," bullish, you want to be looking for a dip to buy at 400 or 4,000, of course, if that"
"22879530","22880710"," becomes a new layer of support."
"22881490","22884130"," We've got some sellers stepping in above here."
"22884210","22884930"," These weren't here before. "
"22885710","22887930"," So these are new sellers above here."
"22888910","22895750"," If your price target is above at 450, the big sellers are actually at 460."
"22898030","22899870"," And let's see if we can see this. "
"22900010","22901430"," These are new sellers coming on."
"22902090","22903190"," These weren't here earlier."
"22903690","22907030"," So we're starting to see some resistance now at 4.46 that we didn't see before. "
"22909290","22913930"," So if you're a bull and you want a new place, I'll tell you what to expect if you're a"
"22913930","22914570"," bull or a bear, I guess."
"22915210","22918750"," If you're a bull, you're going to be looking to buy any dips at 4,000."
"22919410","22920650"," So we'll bring this back up. "
"22922070","22922970"," And you're going to look for this."
"22923190","22927190"," I call it 4.42. Do you want to be buying any dips down here that happen?"
"22927490","22929930"," If we get a dip, you buy it, right?"
"22930750","22937390"," And if you're a bear, you want to be hoping for bad reports to come out like someone was saying"
"22937390","22941010"," they expect Netflix have a bad report."
"22941370","22947620"," And we know that there are sellers up here right now, but they want to get rid of the bags"
"22947620","22948380"," up here. "
"22949380","22954520"," So this is one of those areas, right, where you start to lean on puts."
"22954700","22956100"," They may be worthless to you right now."
"22956780","22963100"," If you want to take a bullish connotation here that we're going up, I have a bunch of puts right"
"22963100","22963680"," now, by the way. "
"22963820","22966380"," And I traded this right here for calls."
"22967000","22969980"," But I'm not going to sell those puts in case the market rolls over."
"22970600","22979020"," For all the bullishness out there, you should be looking at that one month card still, we're still"
"22979020","22980420"," within this channel. "
"22980920","22982340"," There's nothing here, right?"
"22984750","22986650"," It doesn't say we can't roll over here."
"22986870","22988710"," We've rolled over here many times in the past."
"22989010","22992110"," So if you're a bear, just rest easy. "
"22992110","22995730"," That's why I was saying that we definitely need to be cautious as we move forward."
"22995730","22999130"," We need to get off at zero rates, but still need to be cautious."
"22999970","23004130"," If you want to get super bullish, you already buying dips down here at 440 to go this hot go"
"23004130","23004410"," higher. "
"23005050","23008090"," And you also want to be careful until we break above."
"23008690","23012090"," We're interested in that wants to avoid pushing the economy into recession."
"23013830","23014670"," Congrats to the bulls. "
"23014890","23015770"," Good fucking job bulls."
"23016450","23017530"," Good job."
"23033680","23035100"," Yeah, you see how close we are. "
"23037720","23038600"," Can you just imagine?"
"23038680","23039760"," Can you just imagine?"
"23040720","23041420"," Hold on here."
"23043060","23045360"," Can you just imagine being a bull right here?"
"23047890","23049570"," You're like right here and you get fucked."
"23050910","23052690"," And then you're right here and you get fucked. "
"23053590","23055430"," You kind of got fucked early on this one."
"23055630","23058070"," I think we went up here though in the ES."
"23058790","23059810"," Well, not don't quote me on that. "
"23059910","23060510"," We did."
"23061870","23062730"," You didn't hear."
"23063010","23064290"," Well, I don't know if you did hear it didn't. "
"23065710","23068830"," But this is the area here where you do get fucked up here a bull."
"23069250","23070450"," I'm not standing on trade higher."
"23070550","23075490"," I'm just letting you know that this is the area where you are right here. "
"23097420","23099340"," Well, it's been like many times."
"23101940","23103980"," Futures will run with the ball if market close."
"23103980","23109980"," Just asked about the peaking potential for peaking inflation saying that he's watching closely and"
"23109980","23114860"," there are some signs that inflation may have capped off but acknowledges there could still be"
"23114860","23116580"," additional pressures down the road too. "
"23119460","23122720"," Yeah, that's what I was telling you this morning right there going to try to massage this market."
"23123660","23124760"," Fucking these fucking guys."
"23125080","23129220"," They have no fucking these fucking these fucking these fucking fed chairs and fed presences. "
"23129480","23130540"," These fucking guys."
"23132220","23135960"," These fucking guys are going to massage this market to the next three quarters."
"23136380","23140800"," If you guys go back and look at like 98, I think it's 97 or 98 94. "
"23142880","23143980"," I've looked back on this."
"23144260","23146720"," Let me see if I can bring up a SPX."
"23149700","23151080"," I was talking about this this morning. "
"23151280","23152820"," I said I would bring up SPX and do it alone."
"23154740","23156220"," Let's see more advanced chart."
"23159340","23160660"," Let's close this real quick. "
"23165060","23166440"," Because I want to see some cool stuff."
"23170080","23172500"," So where's 1994 or 99?"
"23172800","23174260"," I think 98 was another one."
"23175420","23181500"," 94 was one that I brought up in a week or two ago and they talked about it. "
"23181720","23185680"," As long as the market continues to function, we should keep reducing the balance sheet in the hopes"
"23185680","23189100"," that they can do the balance sheet reduction over the next two to three years."
"23189560","23191220"," This is 1998 right here."
"23193480","23195600"," We had we had the same action going on. "
"23195880","23197080"," 1994 was kind of neat."
"23198560","23200100"," It was 1994 right."
"23200760","23202180"," Market low sell off right. "
"23202340","23206500"," This is February sold off in April but we revisited these numbers again right."
"23207320","23208460"," We visited again in June."
"23209180","23212440"," Notice it wasn't in this is what this is June 16th right. "
"23212860","23219260"," You go to highs but we revisit that low again another nice high end September sell it down again in"
"23219260","23224520"," October sell it down again death the death and destruction in December."
"23225300","23229320"," Then this huge move up and we had similar rate hikes during this time period."
"23230680","23238860"," The point is in this is that in this time frame is that it's still a defined trade range. "
"23239420","23241940"," So what you're looking for is still market bottoms."
"23242800","23249720"," So let's say you had bought back here in March 94 you'd still be shut out luck in December of"
"23249720","23249880"," 1994."
"23251240","23256560"," So that's the point behind that actively managed right you actually buy and sell buy and sell buy"
"23256560","23258600"," and sell buy and sell buy and sell. "
"23258980","23266440"," Now this is manufactured this is modern monetary theory being applied to our markets and you can"
"23266440","23270740"," also see what the end result is after right."
"23271420","23272340"," Fucking blast off."
"23272620","23277140"," Now I don't know if we can or can't do this or if you see the market do this in"
"23277140","23279920"," this in the or if this you know you never know if this is going to take place again. "
"23280700","23287240"," We've had moments like this in past years where this is the attempt to figure this is the attempt"
"23287240","23288020"," that they're going to attempt."
"23288680","23292220"," So you'll see like them get super uber duper bearish and they get super fucking bullish."
"23292440","23296140"," They get super fucking bearish, super bullish, super bearish and then boom we're off and running"
"23296140","23302540"," and what they're trying to do is buy time for inflation to come down trying to buy time for"
"23302540","23308820"," shortages trying to buy time for the war to be over all that kind of stuff in here and see"
"23308820","23311840"," how they fuck around the 50 throughout this entire fucking thing. "
"23312920","23318900"," But anyways that's my point behind where I was talking to you this morning about what do you see"
"23318900","23319760"," for the course of a year?"
"23320240","23322160"," How do you manage this as a bull?"
"23323120","23325900"," If you bought right here you'd be down on the year right?"
"23326280","23329480"," You didn't beat inflation over the course of a year so you have to actively manage a portfolio."
"23330200","23338840"," You've had other instances of this like 2018 2015 and then 98 some other times I've had moments"
"23338840","23339400"," like this."
"23339860","23344340"," So you know great rips in here but you have to act but this is actively managing right?"
"23345040","23346640"," This isn't this over here. "
"23347380","23349220"," This isn't this, this is this."
"23350040","23354860"," You have to actively manage a portfolio and the swings are really big so you don't want to get"
"23354860","23360020"," locked in fucking value because values swings are going to be like you know something like this"
"23360020","23364280"," meanwhile you got fucked because you didn't buy tech."
"23364280","23365120"," Makes sense?"
"23365500","23370800"," These giant rips and cell tech during this time period. "
"23374260","23375280"," Let me get rid of this."
"23378130","23386350"," Now trading higher to 445 67 looking for a tag of 446 I don't know if we get there they"
"23386350","23391490"," usually try to sneak they usually try to you don't actually get the pen sometimes they get the pen"
"23391490","23392110"," but not always."
"23393290","23399450"," There's the pen right there this 446 and we'll see if we can catch that pen above here. "
"23403670","23410230"," Now we're at 44567 and make it a little bit higher here and see if we can reach up and"
"23410230","23410970"," touch the stars."
"23420760","23426400"," Yeah it's funny too is so you're like listen to Bostik speaking right now and then this sounds like"
"23426400","23428800"," we're not doing QT right it's just going to be a threat of QT."
"23429020","23433420"," Remember we're going to start QT in March then May now they're talking about implementing it in"
"23433420","23438600"," June and now you know they're going to they're going to keep talking about talking about until nine"
"23438600","23448320"," months or a year run out while they raise interest rates and try to temper shortages inflation it's"
"23448320","23449200"," still just a bet. "
"23449440","23454040"," I mean that's the other part of this is that it's just a bet like they're placing a bet so"
"23454040","23462900"," that they can outrun inflation shortages and hopefully not figure in a recession but the problem is"
"23462900","23468940"," that if they don't outrun it if those things don't come down the next nine months or a year if"
"23468940","23474200"," the war in the Ukraine doesn't end then they won't outrun it and then you'll have a nasty nasty"
"23474200","23476980"," market sell-off."
"23492390","23498230"," A little bit of a quick roll over in the spy we got the 445.67 not quite four four"

"23615220","23622280"," hold if not look for a dip bite out of 440 you know below or if they go with 440"
"23622280","23631950"," it was a 441 Vwops at 442 69 buyers"
"23631950","23641930"," down below at 443.50 443.98 these buyers here propelled it up higher you might"
"23641930","23651890"," get a little more report in the bell then don't"
"23651890","23659010"," forget on Wednesday you typically have no matter what the market does on tomorrow you'll typically"
"23659010","23668010"," have a cashback a retest of this area here you'll give all this money away tomorrow you'll come"
"23668010","23675790"," back down and check 443.50 either today in this market in today's cash market or you'll do it"

"23727120","23734320"," here I'd like to see if at any point it trades up to 1100 tomorrow it's going to be fucking"
"23734320","23743720"," sell the news so I'd like to at least see it trade to 1050 by tomorrow clothes I think it"
"23743720","23750560"," would have a shot of a good report blasting off to 1100 I think if there's any fucking any of"
"23750560","23756900"," this nonsense tomorrow under the close that shit's going to be sell the news guaranteed but if if"
"23756900","23761080"," we can trade if we can do a nice trade grind up to 1050 I think you have a shot"
"23761760","23769840"," of a good report making some money bad report you know what happens but I don't think you sell the"
"23769840","23778020"," news quite right here I think this is reasonable or somewhere in this vicinity at a thousand I"
"23778020","23786820"," think is reasonable rational for for a decent for a decent maybe hold now it starts getting stupid"
"23786820","23792740"," sometimes we'll get you know like ER can get stupid right it it fucking sells off into fucking"
"23792740","23807440"," sells off the crazy into the into ER or it it it's"
"23807440","23813860"," been selling off like I like the idea that I like the idea that it sold off into ER I'll"

"23836060","23841220"," around 500 million to the sell side but about 15 minutes to go but this could happen this could"
"23841220","23847200"," happen just because people want out so I don't think this is off the tail believe it or not I"
"23847200","23854940"," think this is off the table for tomorrow I've got this I've got this little thing involved going on"
"23854940","23864220"," over here so this kind of a thing that seems more rational right trip 1050 some panic selling into"
"23864220","23873260"," the bell and then you have a decision on which direction we go after ER that makes more sense to"
"23873260","23884630"," me I'm kind"
"23886130","23893910"," of good at closing this gap right now it's better to close it now makes it for an easier run"
