"905610","906050"," It was awesome."
"906910","907790"," Very constructive."
"915430","918130"," Yeah Tesla should blast Tesla should rip. "
"918870","922890"," Like Tesla did this one rip right here but uh on the five minute here."
"924270","927750"," Now this is the one you want to watch and we might be able to take it right now but"
"927750","928610"," I want you to see this right."
"929410","933410"," As soon as they came off that I think I posted this morning they come off that one 1280 or"
"933410","936430"," something and it was off and running on Tesla. "
"937590","939770"," So we'll look at a 15 minute chart."
"939810","942250"," I'm gonna boot book map right here for you."

"945680","948560"," And take a look at book tell you look at Tesla here for a little bit."

"959440","963840"," You could do just you could do just uh you do just one day. "
"964320","971800"," You could do just uh you could do just one day right here and uh just tag 78 percent right"
"971800","979740"," on the opening move on a one day and one hour just pinged it like it was nothing above here."
"981520","986400"," The one hour it was beautiful because if we stay above here it could be a monster move higher."
"991550","992830"," Turn baby. "
"994090","994910"," Go love friend."
"997760","998740"," Just smashing."
"1029730","1030950"," That's only 38 percent. "
"1031089","1031450"," They ain't nothing."
"1042710","1044170"," Got the five minute coming up."
"1044290","1046890"," You got the VWAP coming up to match here. "
"1047010","1051370"," We'll see if we can get a nice quick bounce off of off of uh spy here."
"1061030","1062410"," You don't want to see it trend reversed."
"1062570","1067430"," You don't want to see us come down below here. "
"1071620","1077180"," But to be honest we can come all the way back right up here and it would still be still"
"1077180","1078720"," be bullish as all hell."
"1086020","1087300"," Let's see James Rowan."
"1087560","1090060"," What are you getting on the Nemo indicator this morning?"
"1090920","1092700"," James Rowan in the house this morning or what?"
"1092880","1093820"," You ready to make some money Jimmy?"
"1102000","1102880"," Talk to me James. "
"1105560","1110620"," We reversed the the reverse okay in this morning uh I think it was 4 a.m. or something."
"1111440","1114480"," I don't remember exactly what it was like four o'clock this morning or something we reversed and"
"1114480","1118140"," jumped over and we flipped from uh negative to very positive."
"1118880","1119260"," It was wild. "
"1121000","1122440"," Yeah we did didn't we brother."
"1123800","1124380"," We did."
"1124500","1127660"," I saw it this morning at 4 a.m. I was like I gotta make a post on Twitter this"
"1127660","1132480"," morning on uh captain's alpha because I'm like I don't think they realize we're fucking gonna blast"
"1132480","1133040"," right off. "
"1140120","1142600"," Yeah I was like snap."
"1145320","1147940"," I'm assuming that someone knew down here what was happening."
"1148460","1151120"," That little red bar down here I was like that's all bullshit right here. "
"1151460","1152180"," Get out of here."
"1152380","1155040"," I got out of puts right like literally right when we opened I'm like I'm out."
"1155640","1156860"," I'm not getting smoked here. "
"1158880","1165220"," I was chasing calls down here trying to grab calls to chase this run up because I know it's not"
"1165220","1170160"," going to wait for me and I was surprised we didn't even when we didn't green bar it up before"
"1170160","1173500"," that when we were up here I was like we're just going to fucking green bar it up for even"
"1173500","1178540"," get there and we're going to miss this whole run and they didn't they brought it down so that we"
"1178540","1180400"," could go up which is awesome sauce."
"1187410","1189190"," I'm assuming you can hear my excitement this morning."
"1196660","1203840"," So when we were in the close yesterday we were in the last last 10 minutes before the close the"
"1203840","1210480"," one hour came down like a vertical straight line and just slammed down on on uh on strength on"
"1210480","1211240"," buyers right. "
"1212480","1217580"," And so as we went into the bell yesterday there was a fairly good chance that our normal"
"1217580","1220260"," circumstances that we would have rolled this market over this morning."
"1221100","1225800"," We've opened up with we would have traded sideways which we did right so so much sideways and down"
"1226460","1233400"," but when we opened this morning we reversed and instead of selling into strength they bought the"
"1233400","1234180"," market this morning."
"1235020","1238980"," Now when I saw that I was like I gotta get on Twitter and let these guys know that we're"
"1238980","1240920"," going to have a pretty should have a pretty big reversal. "
"1241160","1245920"," The scary part though is historically we have days like this if we have it if we have a day"
"1245920","1250640"," or two of a big move up it doesn't matter if we go sideways all day today and then up"
"1250640","1254500"," tomorrow we usually get a pretty nasty rollover to complete."
"1254840","1262600"," So the one thing I would warn you of is if we go up have a predetermined sell don't drink"

"3371420","3372420"," I'll make that green."
"3395120","3397300"," Can you guys hear any of that construction in the background?"
"3398460","3399120"," Uh oh. "
"3402740","3403380"," I'm out."
"3403780","3404860"," I got taken out."
"3408620","3414600"," I just tripped stop losses there. "
"3424600","3425540"," Some flat."
"3425700","3427020"," I got nothing on the board now."
"3441500","3444860"," Broke support here and sold straight down. "
"3445260","3447260"," Previous low in the open was."
"3451660","3452840"," Right here."
"3460140","3461920"," Just slammed right through blue. "
"3462100","3466900"," You see that yellow line right there smashed right through smashed right through pivot as well."
"3467800","3469640"," Huge move for the bears here."
"3470420","3471260"," Giant move. "
"3475780","3477240"," Blasted right below here."
"3478000","3479360"," Big liquidity break."
"3479980","3480440"," Huge. "
"3481900","3483660"," Keep that over there so you can see it."
"3492040","3495700"," So much volume that was not showing up yet."
"3496660","3499500"," On this bar right here we had a million cells right there. "
"3502620","3505660"," And a million there and this one's not showing up just yet."
"3506340","3507500"," But this one here was big."
"3508300","3510500"," This pit, this red bar right here was the tell. "
"3510700","3511420"," I wasn't paying attention."
"3515680","3520480"," And a million here, nine hundred, nine thousand here and then one million."
"3521420","3522280"," Point zero one. "
"3524980","3526700"," We'll see what this bar is right here."
"3530100","3532840"," Huge sellback here on 10."
"3532840","3540280"," Twenty five. "
"3542320","3543840"," Huge liquidity break right there."
"3545920","3547220"," So we're in the five minute chart."
"3547380","3548980"," Bears are going to want to stay underneath here. "
"3549920","3551480"," We have this blue line come down."
"3551900","3553060"," See if they can take it down from here."
"3553180","3557340"," We had I think 36% of you said that it was super bearish right here. "
"3557400","3559500"," So you look like you might have a chance at it."
"3560280","3561020"," Right in here."
"3561020","3563960"," If it comes back up and stays under I might grab some puts here. "
"3571100","3572880"," Huge reversal right there monster."
"3581140","3582760"," Now I want to see what those calls cost."
"3583540","3584900"," Like 12 cents right now. "
"3585000","3585480"," They were 20."
"3585800","3587340"," I think about them for 23 cents."
"3601220","3603040"," Good morning state humble to get humbled. "
"3615040","3618240"," Yeah, this is I made a I made a think a hundred percent trade right here."
"3618460","3621440"," I sold 25% loss on puts back here at the open."
"3621920","3625420"," Road this up and then I bought it right right here. "
"3625440","3626020"," I bought it."
"3627080","3629640"," Road it up didn't sell them stated for the whole thing."
"3629920","3633880"," And then it had a stop down here somewhere like 15 cents or something 14 cents. "
"3635040","3637140"," And it just triggered as soon as we went through here."
"3642040","3643780"," Now trading three thirty six."
"3644440","3645980"," I'm going to check the James. "
"3646280","3647100"," I'm going to check the Nemo."
"3650240","3652640"," See if I find it with him bring it up here and find it."
"3662320","3663880"," See if it's saying anything different there. "
"3664440","3668300"," I'm going to assume that that I should have had it up in the background because I'm assuming that"
"3668300","3671020"," that last bar showed it with the with the million cell."
"3681800","3682840"," Where is that?"
"3704780","3706100"," Is it going to bring it up real quick?"
"3715640","3716340"," Come on now."
"3716980","3721100"," I don't know why it's not coming up for me. "
"3731640","3733220"," The website is kind of wonky."
"3736840","3737220"," There we"
"3737220","3747200"," go."
"3749160","3752080"," Yeah, prices below the trigger now was above the trigger. "
"3756860","3759340"," Three eighty one forty six right here."
"3759980","3762100"," So this was actually the trigger."
"3762580","3767500"," I had a three forty one sixty six but it was three eighty one forty six. "
"3772640","3774220"," Right there."
"3777500","3786500"," You have that same price."
"3786500","3788220"," I can't get this thing to stay still. "
"3797460","3798880"," You want to see it?"
"3800660","3804920"," Here, let me exit the reset zoom."
"3805120","3806700"," Let"
"3806700","3820660"," me"
"3820660","3821380"," see if they can bring it down for you."
"3821380","3823280"," Hold on here. "
"3830940","3832040"," Do a full screen."
"3838100","3839000"," Can I do in this right?"
"3839180","3840380"," Oh, you guys can't see all this."
"3845840","3847520"," You can see it right there. "
"3848020","3850840"," This is on the 27th note, 28th."
"3850940","3851980"," So you kind of make it an assumption."
"3858120","3859720"," This isn't the 28th though. "
"3859980","3866480"," Maybe I have to get maybe I have to get a daily velocity is huge too."
"3866480","3868140"," A daily velocity is huge right now."
"3872000","3873240"," There it is. "
"3873400","3874140"," There's daily velocity."
"3877000","3879180"," It's not really doing what I want it to do right now."
"3879200","3879700"," See that's not. "
"3881980","3883220"," It's not holding there."
"3886360","3887560"," There's weekly velocity."
"3887900","3888640"," There's monthly velocity. "
"3891480","3892220"," There's hourly."
"3895160","3896040"," It's weird."
"3897700","3898640"," Hold on a second here. "
"3909140","3910240"," It's really wonky."
"3910760","3912080"," It works here where I put it."
"3912540","3913240"," See now it's not working. "
"3914140","3915120"," There it is working now."
"3917220","3918200"," See how it's not holding?"
"3919620","3921920"," I thought I could click it but maybe I'm wrong."
"3922120","3923800"," I thought I could click here and it would stay on. "
"3928340","3930440"," See how it's like jittering back and forth."
"3934340","3938600"," See that velocity down below trying to come back up and swoop up and nail it."
"3939880","3942720"," It's not translating well to the live stream. "
"3942920","3944460"," It's like acting weird."
"3948660","3950640"," It still has bugs or something."
"3956140","3957580"," Or maybe I'm doing it wrong. "
"3958700","3960400"," Yeah, so that's sticking there when I do it."
"3961900","3962520"," Oh wait a minute."
"3962600","3962780"," I see. "
"3962920","3963100"," Hold on."
"3965540","3967200"," Is that showing our early velocity there?"
"3967940","3969620"," Do it seriously not."
"3975380","3983860"," I can't seem to get it to a second here. "
"3987200","3989020"," See if I can figure this out."
"3992540","3997140"," I started watching the videos on it and then I talked to James about it yesterday."
"4002240","4004560"," Dude now I can't even get it to go full screen again. "
"4005420","4006660"," It's like really really wonky."
"4013320","4014400"," Oh come on dude."
"4021500","4023060"," See they can show it a better light. "
"4030320","4031740"," I think I got this right."
"4031920","4033000"," So let me hold on."
"4037300","4038740"," See if I can bring this up here. "
"4044080","4048760"," Alright, so you see this like you can see this squiggly line right here, right?"
"4048760","4050580"," This is your daily trigger right here."
"4050980","4052320"," See where my pointer is."
"4054940","4059460"," See how I didn't hold above right here. "
"4061040","4061400"," And price."
"4061680","4063480"," See how price I can't even point to it."
"4063500","4064260"," I wish I could point to it. "
"4064840","4068700"," See how the bottom one says monthly, hourly, then daily, then price and then weekly."
"4070560","4073940"," As I scroll over you'll see that price goes down to the bottom."
"4073940","4077400"," Now price is the orange box at the bottom. "
"4079420","4081020"," And I'm going to show you now."
"4081520","4083780"," So see how price was above right here, right where we were."
"4086300","4087760"," See how price is moving up. "
"4088140","4089020"," Price is moving up."
"4089440","4090120"," Price is moving up."
"4090300","4091820"," The little boxes you'll see it jump above. "
"4093780","4096680"," And it got close to the weekly trigger and then it's sold, right?"
"4096939","4097760"," And the price went down."
"4097920","4099700"," Like right here you should have known we're going down, right?"
"4100640","4102240"," And same things right here."
"4102380","4104560"," So we're sitting right at the trigger, right?"
"4105760","4107979"," If you break above the trigger, you're good to go. "
"4108300","4111660"," If you don't, if you go below it, the price is going to dump below."
"4112580","4114040"," Which is not showing right now."
"4117540","4119760"," And you can see where that price is 330. "
"4122180","4123060"," Sorry, hold on here."
"4130140","4131580"," Yeah, 332, 37."
"4132640","4135140"," And it starts to go below the hourly trigger then the weekly trigger. "
"4135439","4137000"," And then the monthly trigger, you know it's ugly, right?"
"4137380","4137920"," I think I'm saying that."
"4138020","4138960"," I don't know if I'm saying that right."
"4149630","4151130"," That's the DIA, I get the wrong one. "
"4151790","4153090"," I'm talking about the Dow Jones industrial."
"4153370","4153890"," Let me put it on spy."
"4156689","4158910"," You guys want to probably have the spy on. "
"4158910","4160109"," Let me reset it again."
"4163810","4164649"," That's back on."
"4164890","4167490"," Every time we reset it goes to DIA, hold on. "
"4168590","4169710"," All right, come on now."
"4170550","4171109"," Try this again."
"4172729","4173850"," So right here, right?"
"4174689","4175710"," Take them on spy again. "
"4175890","4178229"," Okay, so I was talking to DIA."
"4178370","4178850"," That's how it's fine."
"4178950","4179710"," Okay, so spy, right?"
"4180510","4183170"," And see right here is the boxes move. "
"4183590","4183970"," You'll see."
"4186170","4187810"," See how the price is in the bottom."
"4190529","4195550"," You see the price now move above the hourly trigger, the monthly trigger. "
"4196510","4198970"," And then it goes up to the daily trigger, right?"
"4199710","4202730"," If you see, you see the price start to go below the daily trigger."
"4203830","4206310"," And the hourly trigger starts moving below."
"4206510","4209230"," You'll see that it's forecasting of down day, right?"
"4210690","4211970"," So right here. "
"4212770","4215970"," Now, I don't know if I need to get the pro version or something."
"4216770","4217770"," So, damn it."
"4219910","4220630"," Right there. "
"4222470","4222990"," 38195."
"4226530","4228790"," See how it pops back off?"
"4231270","4231790"," 3146."
"4232850","4233010"," Hold on. "
"4233810","4234710"," That's what sucks about this thing."
"4234830","4237770"," This thing needs like space on it."
"4237770","4241050"," Oh, that's pissing me off. "
"4242910","4244230"," That's totally pissing me off."
"4245630","4246810"," Can I do it with my cursor?"
"4251830","4252530"," Right there."
"4252870","4253130"," 38146. "
"4258710","4259570"," Hold on there."
"4267310","4270410"," So it's saying to you that if we slip under here, right?"
"4272970","4277750"," If you slip under right here, like this, this should be a complete trend change down here."
"4278110","4282390"," And it's telling you before the 2020 MA comes. "
"4285130","4287170"," So the bears need to hold this right here."
"4289430","4290230"," The 3146."
"4292270","4293390"," They want to hold this. "
"4293930","4294850"," I think I got this right."
"4295150","4296530"," Maybe James can correct me down here."
"4299170","4301370"," Which is, yeah, I think that's where I put it. "
"4309770","4314110"," So there's need to sell this under here to get huge lows."
"4316790","4317870"," It's James in here."
"4317970","4318790"," Can you listen to this?"
"4330890","4331670"," Yeah, it's it. "
"4332270","4333570"," It's like an e-moy."
"4333990","4335110"," I'm even pronouncing it wrong."
"4335610","4337750"," An e-moy, like there's an A in the front of it. "
"4338250","4339690"," An e-moy."
"4340630","4341450"," Predictive technology."
"4344730","4347150"," And so you want the you want the minute. "
"4348530","4350210"," So in the minute you're cranking, right?"
"4351450","4355610"," And then you want the hourly on the hourly from 930 to 1030 to crank."
"4356670","4357670"," I think I got this right."
"4357870","4361830"," And then once you're once you're over the hourly, it predicts for the rest of the day that you're"
"4361830","4362450"," going to have an update. "
"4363470","4366310"," Now, if you get the I could be wrong on this."
"4366310","4371450"," If you get the minute right and the hourly doesn't follow, you'll trade back below."
"4371930","4373350"," And then you're looking for the bears. "
"4373690","4375490"," I think you're looking for the bears to close."
"4376570","4380130"," I believe 1130 below this level here."
"4380830","4382590"," James, if you're hearing, correct me if I'm wrong. "
"4384890","4387510"," I know he's at the office today."
"4397950","4398870"," Yeah, that's it."
"4399990","4401010"," Let me see if I get this right. "
"4405830","4412810"," Today, I always like this this website does not do well, like switching back and forth between"
"4412810","4413410"," screeners."
"4413910","4415790"," Like rolling it for screener to screener."
"4416450","4418950"," So it's it's not a five minute. "
"4419070","4425490"," It's a it's a daily a monthly and hourly and a weekly trigger."
"4425490","4429870"," I think."
"4435370","4436450"," Oh, come on. "
"4439330","4441170"," This thing is really buggy."
"4444010","4446390"," I think tighter."
"4455830","4457190"," You hear anything right now?"
"4457550","4459030"," You guys hear any construction right now?"
"4470870","4473970"," Yeah, there's a daily I'm maybe I'm saying it wrong. "
"4474030","4478270"," There's a daily a monthly a weekly and an hourly trigger."
"4481050","4482590"," This thing is buggy as fuck."
"4487210","4489470"," So I'm guessing saying the minute when I mean the hourly. "
"4491070","4495910"," So there is velocity on the hourly for us to get up here, but it needed to hold this by"
"4495910","4496630"," 1030."
"4496850","4500150"," Let's say 930 to 1030 when it didn't hold and it came underneath."
"4500930","4503110"," Now from 1030 to 1130, this needs to hold. "
"4521990","4523390"," Now, so the triggers are here."
"4523470","4524330"," I'll bring it back up for you."
"4527830","4529170"," This thing is gets really buggy. "
"4535950","4536910"," Two fucking a."
"4547490","4549270"," See how it doesn't want to open for me."
"4551510","4553590"," Come on, just do it, just do it."
"4556170","4559150"," So you can see if you follow my cursor over here, you see the monthly trigger. "
"4559150","4563010"," Weekly trigger, daily trigger, hourly trigger, monthly."
"4563190","4564670"," And the velocity is different."
"4566910","4568230"," That's the push that's underneath. "
"4569910","4572550"," So your daily velocity is pretty good right here, right?"
"4572750","4576370"," Your velocity is good to be going up here, but it."
"4577430","4579070"," I don't know if I'm explaining this right."
"4580370","4582730"," I need to do any to watch more of the videos from the sky. "
"4582730","4583990"," They've got a."
"4588330","4591050"," So I'm going to exit this guys got a."
"4594690","4599050"," Here if you press right here, there's a view video tutorials."
"4599610","4604890"," I'm only in like, I think I'm three or four videos in down here, four or five videos somewhere in"
"4604890","4605050"," there."
"4605730","4607750"," So I'm not completely in. "
"4607930","4609950"," I'm not completely in this effect."
"4609950","4614710"," I haven't seen the hourly trigger bears bears price rejection video yet."
"4614710","4615130"," I should have watched. "
"4615310","4616190"," I should be watching that one."
"4616830","4618150"," We haven't watched it yet."
"4620110","4623370"," It's an E M O I believe. "
"4624090","4625330"," And they have different."
"4625850","4627430"," I'm not affiliated with them."
"4627770","4629710"," I think James does the beta stuff with them. "
"4631390","4633190"," And I just signed up for the free one."
"4633430","4634910"," I didn't sign up for anything paid."
"4634930","4636910"," I was talking to James last night. "
"4637410","4639990"," And he said to first learn."
"4641790","4647030"," He said to first learn about it and then sign up for possibly a paid version, but he was like,"
"4647030","4647470"," don't."
"4649810","4652690"," He's like, don't go sign up for shit until you at least have the basics down. "
"4656970","4662570"," So he's saying is that you want to you want to see like 11 11 30 hour closed bear share"
"4662570","4665470"," and you can get some real nasty is coming to the market."
"4688770","4690130"," Yeah, he's going to do a video."
"4690490","4691610"," I talked to him yesterday. "
"4691630","4693110"," He's going to do a video for you guys."
"4693170","4698310"," That's just video about the a know about the anomie."
"4699990","4701830"," He tried to explain it again to me last night. "
"4701910","4704430"," I was like, OK, I was like, I'm just going to fucking watch these videos."
"4704430","4704870"," They started."
"4705170","4707550"," I recommend watching the videos from the website. "
"4707550","4709530"," And then."
"4710750","4715170"," Go through what I started doing last night was going through and."
"4716470","4720910"," Tracking it across the timeframe and looking for the convergences. "
"4730430","4735390"," Oh, no, the reason why Friday's live stream was was removed from YouTube was because I can become"
"4735390","4738810"," demonetized for it for drinking booze with you fools."
"4739490","4742790"," That was for Friday's video was only for your benefit."
"4745190","4745890"," That's why. "
"4747950","4750290"," Because it was too happy for YouTube."
"4759810","4766490"," Yeah, it has more to do with YouTube like YouTube has a they they redid their what's acceptable for"
"4766490","4768250"," YouTube and what's not acceptable for YouTube."
"4768790","4774290"," And right now it's not acceptable for YouTube is you and I drinking on Friday. "
"4775930","4776650"," In excess."
"4780050","4781710"," Yeah, I shouldn't say it's that hard."
"4782590","4783790"," I went through it last night. "
"4785270","4786270"," I'm getting it, James."
"4786990","4790750"," It took me like two hours and I'm starting to get it."
"4792310","4793470"," I'm starting to get it, man. "
"4795970","4800690"," I'm not I'm not even proficient, but I'm like, I'm coming along at least."
"4801510","4803010"," So if I can get it, you can get it."
"4812250","4813290"," Is that right, James?"
"4813510","4817870"," So I was telling them that we had the velocity here, right?"
"4819890","4821430"," To make it clear that up here. "
"4822390","4822970"," Make it clear."
"4824770","4825850"," We had the velocity."
"4826230","4828790"," We couldn't close above at 10 30 hour here. "
"4828790","4833690"," And you actually saw the million cells."
"4833990","4837190"," This candle right here was a million cells before you even got this candle."
"4838330","4841950"," Once they dropped it down around 10 35 or so. "
"4842170","4844650"," Now they want to keep it under here for 11 30 right."
"4845570","4847630"," And that would that would show continuation down."
"4847990","4849330"," Am I getting that right or am I getting that wrong?"
"4859150","4861310"," I need to move over to only fans. "
"4862490","4865130"," Do you guys want me to like what I can do is?"
"4866430","4868410"," You know what I'll do is you want me to?"
"4868590","4869070"," How about this?"
"4869410","4876910"," I'll make it a I'll make the video unlisted and I'll send it out via email to subscribers."
"4876910","4878530"," That way you guys can have access to it."
"4883370","4884770"," I'm checking right now, James. "
"4887250","4889710"," James, you noticed that the website can be wonky."
"4892030","4894550"," Like sometimes it doesn't want to do what you want to do."
"4898370","4899130"," Oh, yeah. "
"4900490","4901370"," I'm looking right now."

"8291709","8295930"," saying this James what you're saying is I"
"8295930","8304230"," think what James is saying is you see"
"8304230","8307889"," you can see this vlog."
"8307990","8315610"," This is the monthly velocity and We've got you or if you're buying a bottom you want to see the"
"8315610","8320750"," volot this velocity down below this line here And you're not seeing that yet. "
"8321010","8328389"," So you're not seeing this big red bar down below here So regardless of where price is right now You"
"8328389","8336610"," should see further selling NDIA or spy does that make sense until you see these velocity bricks"
"8336610","8343950"," these red bricks below This orange squiggly line Probably not done selling the spy right now is"
"8343950","8353910"," what James is saying tell me if I'm wrong saying that or not Seriously, just close it Can you"
"8353910","8375590"," can you guys see that or no Now"
"8375590","8385750"," I'm inspecting it My"
"8385750","8387450"," my I'm looking at it right now."
"8387830","8394130"," I'm thinking that it's just what I'm thinking is that he doesn't have a large enough area For you"
"8394130","8419550"," to click on so it's just if you're not exactly exacting in how you're doing it You"
"8419550","8428130"," My point is that Probably not done on a low for today probably gonna see at least In the end"
"8428130","8434290"," of day you're probably gonna see 376 maybe 374 this previous low over here So you're probably gonna"
"8434290","8438910"," see this at some point Oh This S3 right here."
"8439070","8446210"," This is the previous low 378 probably see that today and more than likely You have a price target"
"8446210","8452990"," down below of 370 or something At least if you're following Nemo, that's what you're gonna get out"
"8452990","8458970"," of this trade this trade will end up Printing huge even if there's a pullback above You'll end up"
"8458970","8461490"," getting some monster moves whether it's today or tomorrow. "
"8461490","8470950"," It doesn't matter But that's at least what the Nemo indicator is saying as soon as he broke above"
"8470950","8477470"," here As soon as he broke this this five-minute here This was the candle right here."
"8477590","8483150"," You have a million cells right here As soon as that happened broke down and get this continuation,"
"8483610","8488990"," but the Nemo indicator is saying it's not near like we're not near A bottom here like this is"
"8488990","8498470"," nothing you should see end up seeing like at least S3 Probably 370 or even 367 Some sort of a"
"8498470","8511270"," bloodbath even if it pulls back on up and anything like that We should see some serious lows You"
"8521270","8527770"," Yeah, I think I from what I'm reading on from what I'm seeing on at least on DIA I'm not"
"8527770","8532530"," seeing it on it's not showing me what's showing me in spy, but I can't whatever fucking reason I"
"8533170","8540910"," Can't click on it, but talking about It's over 13th I"
"8540910","8550910"," mean it's basically saying"
"8553770","8561450"," There's potential it's not guaranteed but then on this run here and this roll over here This will"
"8561450","8571450"," over here is the potential to put us all the way back to a retest of October 13 That's not"
"8571450","8581350"," I wouldn't take that as as gospel, but Let"
"8581350","8593290"," me look on a large time frame here That's"
"8593290","8599990"," three that puts us at 360 nope come on now And"
"8599990","8609810"," what the fuck is going on here There's a high probability with what at least what"
"8609810","8623990"," at least what um That break of friend could easily bring us to 348 20 On"
"8623990","8642210"," on on spy this break right here is the significant break in the market Yeah"
"8642210","8650950"," failure to get a new failure to close the gap failure to get a new high I'll put a first"
"8650950","8660710"," how about this I'll put a first target of 360 367 So that's not a hundred points at some point"
"8661850","8666590"," You're gonna expect another hundred point drop easily or at least that's what I think that's what"
"8666590","8682670"," Nemo Nemo is saying You"
"8682670","8691910"," Yeah, you would test you would test on DIA you would you would retest you would retest what?"
"8693530","8703370"," 292 no No no no get that"
"8703370","8714950"," wrong hold on here God damn it Let"
"8714950","8714950"," me"
"8714950","8729370"," see"
"8729370","8739190"," a daily price really trigger August"
"8739190","8749070"," 26th at 12.30 Second here 26th at 12 "
"8749070","8763010",".30 Come on here now I'm on here trying to figure this shit out You"
"8786950","8801650"," That's big that's a big move You Price"
"8801650","8810970"," range 7.3% and then 14 "
"8810970","8813970","% holy shit"
"8822370","8851750"," You"
"8852970","8862870"," I Looking at some Dow Jones max"
"8862870","8872630"," shorts here from triple leverage fucking inverse ETF 376"
"8872630","8882410"," 377 I Couldn't ever retest s1 right now in spy or a test of s2."
"8882470","8892330"," Sorry of a bet It's probably that so some of the stuff I'm looking at in the background Saying"
"8892330","8903430"," that It should be The"
"8903430","8912830"," Reversals should be 26 At least all day long we should we should keep going down all day long"
"8912830","8920010"," and then there should be a slight pullback and then Further down, but there's a big pullback that"
"8920010","8925810"," would come up and then we're gonna blast even further down At least that's what Nemo's that's what"
"8925810","8952830"," an emo is saying And I don't know if that's true because I haven't used it too much 325 It's"
"8952830","8962930"," like 325 on Nemo's should be a bloodbath Like"
"8962930","8974270"," the moment 325 breaks on Let's see it look at DIA here Yeah,"
"8974370","8982030"," the moment 325 breaks it should be a fucking bloodbath So definitely a price target of 325 on on"
"8982030","8994880"," Nemo I and But if that breaks if you get that 325 break you're talking about going You'll"
"8994880","9006380"," easily see sub 300 something like that 300 maybe 297ish That's"
"9006380","9007620"," a big of a break that is right there"
"9008660","9038040"," You"
"9044520","9053500"," So I would look something like this You would see some cup because it broke trend in here you would"
"9053500","9061140"," see Some kind of move down here and then a rejection and then this would be a bloodbath this would"
"9061140","9072940"," just be like Straight down That's pretty big You"
"9081540","9083800"," Missed that I'm getting some text messages"
"9098660","9128040"," You"
"9128660","9131880"," Hey"

"9229520","9234760"," that's fine out breaking below Spine out break and blow S2 you should see a price target down below"
"9234760","9235240"," here today. "
"9235780","9243960"," Just break this trend break this morning This roll over here this morning huge Implications are"
"9243960","9250800"," much lower than even this price target Implications are retest well so far what I'm reading in the"
"9250800","9256740"," background here is the retest of the lows in October Our potential for for the lows in October on"
"9256740","9262220"," this trade there probably be a Small retracement and then a larger retracement, but it doesn't"
"9262220","9266900"," matter that trend break there We'll probably coincide with the four-hour trend change at some point"
"9269060","9278720"," So I got to get text messages in the background We have a transfer station here in Detroit and"
"9278720","9287300"," They want to use a claw On a dumpster and I'm like do not do that because I'll pay for"
"9287300","9294100"," the dumpster if So they have to hand pull everything out because I don't want to fuck up fuck up"
"9294100","9320090"," a dumpster rental You"
"9320090","9337890"," Yeah, I like those those leaps on I like those leaps on Tesla you those are nice Yeah"
"9337890","9341930"," Yeah, you get a price target down here almost guarantee we're gonna hit this today almost guarantee"
"9341930","9357400"," it At some point today we'll give it to the clothes to see if we hit this You"
"9380400","9384140"," Let me see if I can show you guys let me see if I can show you guys this screen"
"9384140","9388120"," grab again Let me explain it better to you explain it to you one more time."
"9388320","9388700"," He will do it."
"9388760","9406780"," We'll do it again Monthly"
"9406780","9419590"," velocity Today"
"9419590","9421390"," I'll show you guys why I'm saying that to you. "
"9421650","9431450"," So this is not S&P 500 But I want you to See how so this morning you had"
"9431450","9438310"," today I bring this closer so you can see the entire thing Okay, so you got you guys kind of"
"9438310","9445430"," see that If we were able to break today above That if we were able to break above trigger today"
"9446130","9451190"," We have the potential to move higher here squeeze higher when we didn't right you're watching all"
"9451190","9456190"," this here This velocity downwards not to be able to break out of that velocity so you can see it"
"9456190","9456850"," right here, right?"
"9457850","9463790"," If we're not able to break in and above that velocity to push us higher We actually start to break"
"9463790","9469990"," down below This initial move today is nothing right you'll see this first initial move pull back up"
"9469990","9475570"," and then it's slammed down Even farther we already know that that as what we already know as well"
"9475570","9478770"," at the market breath indicator Says we even today."
"9479010","9483930"," We said if we broke higher that you'd see a swift reversal So we'd see a failure in reversal."
"9484350","9489950"," So it didn't matter when the failure took place the failure could have taken place They could have"
"9489950","9497350"," taken place Right we were today Or higher on a higher right 3d8 and then we then we slam down"
"9497350","9502130"," and then you get the continuation bloodbath down So it didn't really matter where or when it"
"9502130","9505970"," happened, but we know that we can look big It's a real basic thing, right?"
"9506170","9515550"," You can also say it But you can look and see that once you get that breakdown"
"9515550","9522530"," you'll start to see these red bars actually turn into these red bars And then come down below and"
"9522530","9529070"," become red bars down here And it's showing you the strength at which when which you'll end up"
"9529070","9531650"," getting a push push lower Does that make sense?"
"9532030","9538890"," So you'll start to see here is you'll see no, I don't want to fucking save it So you'll start"
"9538890","9539510"," to see here. "
"9539550","9541190"," We'll go to a one-hour chart, right?"
"9542230","9548530"," So you're gonna start to see here is you see the sell-off right we broke above this morning And"
"9548530","9554230"," on that hourly candle we couldn't hold it the moment that we didn't hold it We did have that trend"
"9554230","9555350"," change right yesterday."
"9555690","9562450"," I said to hey at that this I read it The 310 or pre 40 or 351 I was like"
"9562450","9568570"," you saw this slam of sellers come in right hopefully these sellers don't come back in today and We"
"9568570","9574850"," got the role, but that's not the killer the killer is and this is regardless of the 0.68 fib"
"9574850","9580130"," down here the killer is That even if you get the retracement here, right?"
"9581250","9586770"," You'll end up getting more sellers again on that one hour and this is where this is where it gets"
"9586770","9595050"," brutal is When you start to reverse trend like that And here's your four-hour candle above here So"
"9595050","9601930"," your four-hour trend even begins to change so With the with the velocity not even at max velocity"
"9601930","9609170"," yet, you'd expect at some point You'd expect at some point to see a retracement, but that's not"
"9609170","9615950"," really that's not bullish is the point point is is that the continuation Will be down at this"
"9615950","9616210"," point."
"9616370","9622830"," We even said this morning that if we're above able to get above this That this any any rip higher"
"9622830","9628830"," would be sold for a huge For a huge move down because we knew in the monthly that the that"
"9628830","9633290"," the that the move was down not like up here or anything like that Does that make sense?"
"9633710","9640570"," I don't know if that makes any sense to you guys And so when you saw the trigger break down"
"9640570","9648250"," here we move down there shouldn't be any Like return to the scene of the crime get back into the"
"9648250","9649790"," channel and move higher. "
"9650010","9650970"," That shouldn't take place."
"9651210","9654890"," It should be Because it's the one hour and four-hour trend change."
"9655490","9656490"," It should be a bloodbath. "
"9656690","9658810"," You can see here that you got a bloodbath right here, right?"
"9659770","9665730"," And you haven't seen that bloodbath yet here So even if you get the trade up and then down so"
"9665730","9671290"," it doesn't matter if you had 68% come here come up here You're still going down You could come"
"9671290","9675830"," straight down for the rest of today and it's not going to matter."
"9676110","9679730"," It's the trend change that's going to matter Does that make sense?"
"9680290","9685170"," I don't know if that does or doesn't and you can see it on Well on air you can see"
"9685170","9696170"," it on It's second here Put"
"9696170","9702790"," you back at the five minute here so you can see what that blue line is You You can see"
"9702790","9708210"," it on The Nemo or a Nemo at this point."
"9708790","9715110"," Let me see I bring that snipping tool back up And this is what I think the point I could"
"9715110","9720770"," be wrong in this if I'm wrong at any point and James is listening and He's like hey, you don't"
"9720770","9733030"," talk about I'll digress to him but Oh Shit Minimize"
"9733030","9746810"," it not make it smaller and this is the monthly velocity here So I'll attempt to hold on here I"
"9746810","9763710"," think it's saucy So"
"9763710","9766890"," I'm only going to do this one more time and stream and not this will be the last time that"
"9766890","9776530"," I go through it but You can see I'll make it simpler simpler if I can So you can see"
"9776530","9782790"," this this this velocity here, right You see it broke below See it's squiggly Ryan right here and"
"9782790","9788410"," this purple line right here value the violet the guy calls it We weren't able to get above here And"
"9788410","9793070"," we weren't able to get above you can actually see previous instances over here My cursor is where"
"9793070","9798690"," we did get above Right we had continuation higher, but if you don't get above it right they've made"
"9798690","9803630"," another attempt to get above it They broke And so here's an example of when it broke came back up"
"9803630","9809970"," and still sold down and the key here is this this part right here because you're seeing This moment"
"9809970","9816150"," you guys velocity be called momentum I guess and if this momentum doesn't transfer into this move"
"9816150","9822930"," higher It's going to then like you see here transfer lower and then lower again. "
"9823150","9823770"," Does that make sense?"
"9824230","9829110"," So you should see another brick come down here and then another brick come down here at some point"
"9829110","9831110"," something like that Maybe not that deep."
"9831330","9838450"," Maybe to hear And you'd see the degradation of the spy Continue continue down."
"9838850","9848850"," I think that's what he's saying All right cancel that shit And so you'll probably end up seeing"
"9848850","9857210"," the move down here should be The move down here should be at least 374 today And whatever pullback"
"9857210","9863430"," you end up getting Should end up be whatever like whatever you come up from here It doesn't really"
"9863430","9869690"," matter you're going to wind up selling down to retest october 13th is what the point is Point them"
"9869690","9873690"," trying to make is that you should get down here today and then it doesn't you're not gonna you"
"9873690","9877610"," broke below Uh the trigger once you broke that trigger. "
"9877850","9884930"," It's all over you're gonna sell the market and more than likely head down and uh You'll sell the"
"9884930","9889110"," market and then you'll end up selling down the market even further more than likely testing october"
"9889110","9893670"," 13 I could be running that but right now it's we're still selling right now."
"9893790","9906190"," So it makes sense But that's what's gonna happen Yeah,"
"9914390","9918610"," I don't know if that helped well or helped well as a description in that But you should end up"
"9918610","9923570"," seeing that continuation at some point you should see a bloodbath into this close Almost 100"
"9923570","9930110"," percent sure you'll see a bloodbath into the close You could see some kind of uh You could not"
"9930110","9938110"," guaranteed, but it's not going to really matter because you'll see continuation even lower You'd"
"9938110","9944590"," have to break above You'd have to break above the one hour at some point and hold it and otherwise"
"9944590","9950650"," you're just gonna consolidate around the one hour And the could the selling should continue should"
"9950650","9968810"," be a good bloodbath here Now"
"9968810","9974170"," you can pause the program and go back and look at it I've gave you a simple chart that you"
"9974170","9979710"," can like take a crayon and just figure it out Just a moment ago."
"9979870","9984990"," I brought up a chart showing you when the we're not even at max velocity as the point So like"
"9984990","9991270"," right here is nothing The point is that this move right here If you go back and pause the program"
"9991270","9996370"," and look so I know that you think this is horrible And it's not this is nothing. "
"9996810","10006450"," This is like This is the start There's like two more moves lower Two full moves lower"
"10006450","10016250"," from here And so as you reach each one you'll you'll either look for"
"10016250","10022650"," continuation for the next leg Or pull back and then extend the continuation of the next leg Does"
"10022650","10023470"," that make any sense?"
"10034070","10038750"," And that's what that so yesterday's broadcast if you were here yesterday's broad if you were here"
"10038750","10045290"," yesterday's broadcast there was a I took puts on the belly yesterday because I was very scared."
"10045510","10046270"," I was like, oh man."
"10046470","10050950"," This is gonna get really nasty Uh, let me mute this here. "
"10051430","10052550"," Let me put this away."
"10052550","10053910"," So hold on here."
"10054230","10054590"," What was that?"
"10054990","10065150"," I don't know what that was You know what the fuck that is Okay Okay Okay,"
"10065150","10074610"," hold on Let me get rid of this Okay, so let's look yesterday"
"10074610","10083250"," so right in here, right You could see this candle right here. "
"10083250","10090790"," This was an important candle Yesterday it was right at uh, I want to say was that I think I"
"10090790","10103030"," posted on it Twitter And Say and bring this bring this back over here This"
"10103030","10111590"," is the important candle yesterday was right at uh At 1551 so 351 yesterday I had mentioned this in"
"10111590","10112130"," twitter too."
"10112230","10116230"," I had said I'd taken some puts on the bell because of this candle right here."
"10116230","10123490"," This candle was critical Yesterday and uh, the sellers came in Shut it back down, but we did find"
"10123490","10124690"," buyers immediately. "
"10125130","10129290"," I'll go as triggered and just brought it right back up This is so fast is that and within a"
"10129290","10136330"," minute We saw this yesterday, but this had a signal that across over Oh, let me see if I can"
"10136330","10142470"," show this on a better and a better chart didn't it didn't show up well today It didn't show up"
"10142470","10155470"," in today's chart well, but it did show up well Yesterday's chart Sometimes"
"10155470","10158670"," it is like Right here."
"10158710","10162430"," I'm gonna show it to you right here what it showed up yesterday pretend you pretend none of this"
"10162430","10168210"," was here today, okay Pretend you can't see any of this So you could see us come up yesterday, right"
"10169090","10172810"," We came up and we tagged Right here."
"10172830","10179110"," This is like 351 and it was immediately was a sell And it just rocket shit down. "
"10179370","10180410"," So I was like, oh shit."
"10180570","10185030"," I was like, that's really bad And the only reason the only reason went back up was because"
"10185030","10186610"," algorithms were triggered to buy it."
"10186610","10189590"," So boom they bought it Then we came down here yesterday. "
"10190150","10197970"," Now Into today we were trading higher than the one-hour trigger and you can actually see The red"
"10197970","10200970"," candle up here we came back up here today, right?"
"10201710","10207470"," And we couldn't hold the one-hour candle and we couldn't hold the velocity by breaking above"
"10207470","10210350"," velocity here Sellers came right in and told you no."
"10210550","10217250"," So the moment that happened we started to sell down into the one hour Now there's some problems"
"10217250","10217510"," here."
"10217650","10223210"," It wouldn't have mattered even even in the post that I made this morning I had posted and told you"
"10223210","10229710"," it doesn't matter If we break above because you're looking for a failure up here, it doesn't matter"
"10229710","10235350"," if you fail up here Um, that's three eighty seven three eighty eight It doesn't matter if we break"
"10235350","10241010"," trend if we break trend here or if we fail above here Right, it doesn't matter. "
"10241270","10245190"," You have a failure for a new how I feel you to close the gap It wouldn't matter and even"
"10245190","10251510"," said that the death down here is going to be huge I said two or three hundred points Now you're"
"10251510","10252890"," getting it early, right?"
"10253070","10257810"," So you've gotten the break early here Right they said oh hell no, you're not even getting up there."
"10257930","10262910"," You're just we're just going to trade this down so the point would be That you've got the you've"
"10262910","10267390"," got the uh the trend change It doesn't matter if you close here today."
"10267550","10271550"," It doesn't matter if you come back up today You're still going to get down here and hit this"
"10271550","10274250"," trigger You're still going to come down here at this point. "
"10274370","10279810"," You're not ever getting back up here in my view Until you at least come back down and you know"
"10279810","10286130"," touch some of this stuff down here And more than likely you'll see an attempt Due to looking at the"
"10286130","10293150"," nemo a nemo a nemo is telling you oh no, you start stacking these up And you probably have two"
"10293150","10302710"," or three moves lower Uh looking at the diA at least You don't have to make any sense to you"
"10302710","10320170"," out there, but I hope it does You"
"10320170","10332770"," Jesus I was going to try to cut away for the whole morning and I'm like I can't Well, I"
"10332770","10335970"," don't know people in the people in the stream have been telling you we're going to bounce up here"
"10335970","10339150"," We're going to bounce here bounce But we're still heading lower."
"10339410","10345310"," So I'm not going to expect any kind of an STX buy signal Or anything until we hit somewhere down"
"10345310","10350550"," here 375 or so Uh, we're we're still trading right off the five minute."
"10350690","10355110"," You can see us come up consolidate And we're still selling off that five minute. "
"10355210","10361410"," So there's no reason to think There's no reason even here to think that you can take a long here"
"10363790","10375120"," You'd have to see you'd have to see One second here paying tight So"
"10375120","10380480"," you see this blue line right here, right as we talk about this every day There's like zero time"
"10380480","10386760"," that we don't talk about it's like all day This is all all day long all day every day All"
"10386760","10387400"," day every day."
"10387500","10388820"," It's the same conversation, right?"
"10389220","10392700"," You see this line Right we start teeing off it."
"10392960","10393940"," It's it's negative, right?"
"10394560","10400220"," You can't even take A long until you're above it with consolidation and move higher. "
"10400440","10405960"," We already know that this is like 101 trading Um, that's pretty simple, right?"
"10406800","10418780"," We're below the blue line right now Right there Maybe"
"10418780","10427200"," I should turn the screen or upside down for you Or maybe I should draw it like this Right there"
"10432000","10475320"," Right there is what there's a consolidation point right there So"
"10475320","10481900"," So we're getting extremely bearish in the one minute extremely bearish in the five minute on the"
"10481900","10492720"," dgia right now Yeah Yeah, it's got a word-ass name doesn't it It's"
"10492720","10493800"," done fairly well here."
"10493860","10495680"," It did it did well this morning."
"10495680","10499420"," It showed the break here It showed the break right here. "
"10499560","10504760"," You guys saw that I had up here at stop losses up here A moment you break these stops down"
"10504760","10505060"," here."
"10505100","10507140"," You hopefully didn't stay in calls."
"10507380","10514660"," There's been no reason to stay in calls down here So If you don't use stops, I don't know what"
"10514660","10517000"," to say to you if you don't put puts on it. "
"10517000","10522580"," I don't say to you Where if you're looking to put calls on your look you're waiting if you're like"
"10522580","10529320"," I only take calls then you're waiting for Consolidation and then you take the long here That makes"
"10529320","10535720"," sense, but you can't take the long until you see that you you can't buy a dip right here Can't"
"10535720","10542280"," buy a dip right here because there's no confirmation That you're going higher When you wouldn't cut"
"10542280","10548600"," a short here You wouldn't cut a short here unless you broke above this right you cut yourself loose"
"10548600","10558100"," and wait to get back underneath it To take it lower so the same kind of concept here It's just"
"10558100","10568300"," in the reverse Right here, so you're just looking at looking to keep this short right here I"
"10568300","10568980"," hope that helps."
"10569160","10572240"," I don't know if that's helping or not or if it sounds like not trying to be a dick about"
"10572240","10572380"," it."
"10572440","10579500"," I'm trying to be Trying to give you an idea of You shouldn't be buying dips here. "
"10579620","10586980"," You should know that this this is Trader 101 That you don't ever time like a dip buy or even"
"10586980","10595360"," a sell buy so you can't like The the short was right here the short wasn't up here the short"
"10595360","10598360"," wasn't You get you grab and puts right here."
"10598360","10602020"," The short was here the moment this broke it was on."
"10602320","10608260"," Does that make sense Because this could easily have gone up In here does that make sense?"

"10987300","10993040"," from them, but not when they're initially traded Uh when they're initially traded you usually see,"
"10993340","11001040"," uh, the market dump And then you'll see a trade higher Uh, that that's possibly that trade into"
"11001040","11012120"," january And my other fear on tesla is if there's another round of yearly put hedging on tesla So So"
"11012120","11019860"," I think this might be a time of year That would be good to have some options flow Data to"
"11019860","11027900"," look at Into the 30th Because if you don't see hedging that deep if the hedging let's say the"
"11027900","11032580"," hedging flow that comes in tomorrow or friday Is let's say the hedging flow."
"11033020","11039680"," Let's say the hedging flow is deep like, uh, I don't know 3000 or something Uh, or even lower 3100"
"11039680","11048980"," 3,000 2,400 stuff like that There's two react two actions to it you end up seeing You end"

"11323900","11329160"," history when we break below when you see that blue cross right here You see that other blue cross"
"11329160","11335860"," right there When you see those things happen, right usually and historically this is even going"
"11335860","11340460"," back to like the 19 Uh, I don't have the ny I don't have the ny a up right now,"
"11340480","11344300"," but if you have it on the ny a Whenever that does happen."
"11344420","11345180"," It's typically bad. "

"11377360","11381100"," you don't want stuff like this right here You don't you don't want that you start seeing that"
"11381100","11381900"," crossover here. "
"11382060","11383380"," It's a prime example, right?"
"11383800","11388560"," Come down here with just bloodbath This is another bloodbath right here."

"11397740","11404980"," We're coming on it right now as you speak And this role right here today is significant Uh, and so"
"11404980","11412800"," saying to you to look for Saying to look for for retest down below here, but You could technically"
"11412800","11421660"," just call it at You know, 369 368 370 somewhere in here And we're close to that right now, right?"
"11421900","11430240"," We're We're uh 377 we have another 70 points to go on on spx So right down in here is"
"11430240","11438240"," where that line is that weekly moving average is like right over here It's really close right We're"
"11438240","11445380"," really close down here So if you had that trade down to 370 you'd get a reaction and then you're"
"11445380","11451360"," going to see that 50 Just come screaming down on top So even if you had a trade that was"
"11451360","11456840"," you know if it came down here and then bounced back up You'd expect that 50 on a weekly moving"
"11456840","11470020"," average to send it Karining straight back down again That makes any sense So"
"11470020","11475700"," you're hoping and praying and begging and saying oh yeah, we're gonna Like cap is there that huge"
"11475700","11484900"," trade for for tesla in january Uh probably depends on a lot on where the hedging is if there's"
"11484900","11493510"," hedging on tesla or not If there's major hedging on the stock market Well, we can look to see where"
"11493510","11499510"," it is i can bring it back up And see where the 50 is in the weekly right now, but"
"11501170","11515630"," You Uh px Yes"
"11530470","11540830"," It's not that high it's like um Right now it's sitting at 406"
"11543610","11549570"," And as time passes it's going to keep coming down and keep coming down and keep coming down So you"
"11549570","11559110"," probably expect it to come down Say uh, we'll look at We'll look at uh Tuesday"
"11559110","11568550"," january 3rd It's at 406 406 on january 3rd So there's even room to trade up there There's even room"
"11568550","11575850"," in january to trade up let's say 406 now Uh, but you'd still be looking for that major rejection"
"11575850","11582810"," like this huge rollover in the market So it's it still fits the narrative of It still fits the"
"11582810","11589790"," narrative of uh, a january rip trade And you'd still be in high danger of the market having a crash"
"11593370","11600090"," You'd still fit the narrative for deep hedging A rip in january and then some kind of bloodbath"
"11600090","11607630"," heading into march Or at least an attempt for that bloodbath heading into march And once we're"
"11607630","11613450"," underneath and then and the scary part is if we're underneath the weekly moving average if we're"
"11613450","11620250"," underneath the 50 Weekly moving average you That would that would still get to the rip but it would"
"11620250","11625930"," put us underneath And then if we traded it sideways the rest of 2023 It opens the door to like"
"11625930","11635090"," 24 2600 So just coming back tesla arounding arounding back tesla Uh, can tesla go lower than 90"
"11635090","11641630"," bucks or a hundred bucks you bet your ass Uh, if the macro environment says they were going that"
"11641630","11648310"," low There's nothing stopping tesla with no matter what their revenue is from going much much lower"
"11650170","11662880"," Nothing there's nothing stopping a repricing event on tesla You But"
"11662880","11669800"," that hasn't happened yet, so we have to see what happens when we get there is the point Little bit"
"11669800","11674420"," of reversal here on this on the spy right now for making our way back up to the one hour"
"11674960","11683560"," for the five minute on On spy we're going to see if this rolls here at 378 60 We're going"
"11683560","11689080"," to look for a rejection or a continuation on 370 378 60 is probably the price target. "
"11689640","11715500"," We almost touched it earlier here at 1240 So"
"11715500","11717360"," Illumina capital has a price target of 66."
"11717680","11724160"," Yeah, I think 66 is if if we were to hit like 3,100 3,000 3,200 somewhere in"
"11724160","11730100"," there that doesn't wouldn't surprise me We've seen it in the past with the best companies."
"11730360","11731000"," We've seen it with Amazon. "
"11731340","11739240"," We've seen it with Apple We've seen it with other companies where they just get repriced and It's"
"11739240","11742040"," like horrible but It can't happen."
"11742380","11749420"," You should be open to it happening happening There's no like crystal ball saying yeah, that's where"
"11749420","11755020"," it's going to like, you know, it's going to 60, but we're going to 40 But if you had a"

"11760460","11770200"," sacred And the scary part is It opens it opens up Elon Musk and tesla to be corporate rated"
"11771940","11778320"," Because you don't know how much Elon has sold you don't know How quickly you could lose this"
"11778320","11786880"," company If he doesn't have the money to buy back his shares Then you could see someone committed"

"11792770","11799640"," You could see a you could see a large player committed try to buy by tesla So there's some risk"
"11799640","11804380"," there down the road doesn't mean it's going to happen, but You know, there's real risk on the table"
"11804380","11810240"," for for Elon and tesla And there are powerful people that would love to take it away from you can't"

"11852380","11860740"," down to the depths of hell Now then they could leverage that which is you know scary and hindsight"

"15641510","15646950"," trigger for bullish was up here Right here We didn't get it over here."
"15647150","15652170"," We got it here and they sold it right back down again Our our trigger for bullish yesterday was"
"15652170","15659030"," right here And if you were if we were looking on an hourly chart, you'd see it Uh, we'd broken"
"15659030","15659770"," above here. "
"15659930","15665010"," We'd have some pretty big velocity to get us cranking or moving up higher We didn't get it there."
"15665650","15667070"," Uh, we started to get it."
"15667210","15679070"," I just need just a one moment to Or hold on a second After"
"15679070","15679650"," just give me a minute. "

"15695330","15700430"," I believe 390 somewhere in here like a big nice fat giant move And that didn't happen. "
"15700630","15707090"," So, uh, we had one bigger problem though, and that was on the one hour chart Uh, this one hour"
"15707090","15713310"," trend that we were at least on we broke below it This is a very negative thing to have happened"
"15713890","15716850"," Uh, it doesn't matter that we come up here and recheck."
"15716930","15720310"," It doesn't matter if we come up here and recheck Doesn't matter if we come up here and recheck to"

"15756270","15760310"," blocks of velocity here And now you're seeing big blocks of velocity here."
"15760510","15769810"," You should see two or three more big blocks below Uh So i'd be wary if you were a bull"
"15770270","15771170"," Be honest with you. "
"15771230","15774990"," I know everybody says this that everybody's like, you know, the options market this the options"

"15830620","15839880"," right there That's uh, three 380 389 So here's the here's the truth, right?"
"15840120","15849220"," If you don't get to 389 today, it's bearish Right Here we have to trade above on an hourly to"
"15851110","15860670"," change trend Trend the actual trend So unless you get above this line,"
"15860670","15869470"," nothing's fucking bullish Uh A larger time frame talking about a larger time frame here You want to"

"17382640","17386640"," Okay, so Did they touch the pp down here?"
"17386800","17387340"," Is that what they did?"
"17390170","17392070"," Did they come right down here and touch it?"
"17392450","17393990"," Looks like they did, doesn't it?"
"17397430","17399510"," Looks like they touched it to the green box."
"17404910","17406510"," Did you guys see that move down?"
"17410150","17412150"," Looks like they went right down here, right?"
"17412310","17413510"," They traded it right down here. "
"17414330","17415230"," Touch it right there."
"17417610","17419030"," Touch the pp, baby."
"17422550","17424570"," So they did go down there. "
"17426030","17430430"," Hold on, I got to send some stuff here."
"17437990","17439490"," No, no, no, no."
"17447570","17449270"," Oh, did you guys want to see something cool?"
"17449610","17450750"," I got something cool for you. "
"17452110","17453690"," You guys were asking about this before."
"17453930","17455210"," I got a cool picture to send you."
"17456590","17458430"," Someone asked a limit. "
"17462550","17464290"," I'll send you guys a photo right now."
"17467370","17468190"," I got to send."
"17472110","17473230"," Hang tight a second here. "
"17473430","17474770"," I got another bunch I got to send."
"17477010","17479890"," Okay, so here, you guys lost some cool."
"17481030","17482810"," I just sent myself some photos too. "
"17487570","17490630"," Someone was asking in stream yesterday or the day before."
"17493350","17494950"," Okay, so we came down here, right?"
"17495110","17496630"," We touched the green bar."
"17497750","17498990"," We went coast to coast, right?"
"17499510","17500510"," We came up here. "
"17501090","17502910"," Came straight back down here, coast to coast."
"17507790","17510190"," So what would be the plan for right here, right?"
"17511530","17514490"," Would be for bears to load back up here."
"17518030","17521070"," As you get this bounce above, you don't want to get caught in here, right?"
"17521830","17529710"," You want to see what happens in here and you want to have your finger again on the put button"
"17529710","17530770"," for the close. "
"17533450","17537150"," You can have your finger on the call button or whatever."
"17539330","17540690"," I'm going to draw you another box."
"17544310","17545930"," Let me see at least here. "
"17550850","17551570"," Right there."
"17554350","17555930"," I'll put another one down below."
"17559790","17560370"," Right here. "
"17561090","17562630"," I don't know if we get to that one."
"17562710","17570050"," That one's going to be hard to get to, but what I'm going to be looking for is"
"17570050","17574710"," to stay below this blue line."
"17574750","17580530"," If we can stay below this blue line, well, you're more than likely going to see something like"
"17580530","17580910"," this. "
"17583830","17585550"," Whatever the fuck that is right there."
"17585950","17592890"," Then you're going to wind up seeing something like hopefully something like this and move down at"
"17592890","17593710"," least into the belt."
"17595150","17604970"," There could be a squeeze up here to get down there, but we can do a little and"
"17604970","17608430"," do a little job up here. "
"17610150","17610990"," Something like that."
"17611130","17613490"," If you wanted, you could, on your own, you can figure that out."
"17614790","17616550"," That's not the point. "
"17617250","17618390"," Just more consolidation here."
"17618850","17620050"," Already tagged below right here."
"17620950","17624230"," I'm going to expect this to drain out or bleed off into the belt. "
"17626990","17629130"," What do I got here?"
"17631830","17639490"," You guys were asking for a down below that one to you."
"17639730","17640810"," You guys can see that one."
"17647050","17656810"," Someone was asking about just some pictures of the work that was done in my house, but I also"
"17656810","17657690"," have some pictures. "
"17661530","17666910"," I also have some pictures from when I did the ."
"17668790","17670510"," Look at that right there."
"17673330","17676010"," This is from the basement."
"17678070","17681570"," It's 44 feet up to that top right there. "
"17685710","17687150"," Here's another shot of it."
"17689490","17692330"," That was a center of the house chimney."
"17694890","17697970"," It goes up from the basement, 44 feet. "
"17701390","17705210"," Nothing you all care, but I think someone in here cared."
"17707430","17711010"," Yeah, it's 44 feet from the basement to the rooftop."
"17719880","17729680"," It's not a giant footprint in the house, but what it is is, sorry, my hair is down"
"17729680","17729920"," today. "
"17731180","17734620"," It's not a giant footprint in the house, but it's a giant footprint in terms of volume."
"17737840","17741180"," The house is built around that chimney in the center."
"17742540","17750680"," I was able to, when I took that chimney out, I was able to remove most of the walls in"
"17750680","17753160"," the first floor and create this big open space. "
"17754620","17762140"," Not the kitchen and there's a big bathroom in the first floor and there's some alcovish walls so"
"17762140","17768220"," you can go and have a little library and a sitting area like a study."
"17769220","17775900"," Then there's a large living area and there's a big entryway and closet area."
"17779320","17789100"," The second floor is one, two, three bedrooms and a few bedrooms in a"
"17789100","17790980"," large jack and jill bathroom. "
"17791760","17801560"," Then the attic space is going to get a dormer or a full dormer for another floor with a bathroom"
"17801560","17804580"," in it for the in-suite bathroom."
"17804940","17814940"," The basement is being renovated to be turned into, I've got two offices in there now and then I've"
"17814940","17822620"," got a large closet for all the utilities and then a large living area."
"17823260","17827940"," The other cool part is that the washing machine and dryers are now on the first and second floor. "
"17828500","17837620"," There's no wash and dry on the basement any longer."
"17842690","17843430"," It was."
"17843810","17851410"," I had walls that were structural support but the chimney was not so I had to run LDLs like an"
"17851410","17860730"," eye beam type actual like three LDLs to the exterior walls and then"
"17860730","17868050"," pin load or point load those down all the way down to the foundation. "
"17869770","17874870"," So pin or called point loads and I know it was a point loads all the way it is always"
"17874870","17878130"," down to not the foundation but the foundation wall."
"17878690","17882430"," And so the foundation now carries one."
"17883910","17889350"," One carries one floor with a ton less weight. "
"17889650","17891050"," There's a bunch of a bunch of walls are gone."
"17903180","17904420"," Yeah, now it's a laundry shoot."
"17904620","17905840"," No, I didn't do the laundry shoot. "
"17905960","17908240"," I ended up doing the I ended up."
"17908880","17913800"," I've got the washer and dryer in each floor with tiled in."
"17915880","17922740"," If you're ever going to put a washer and dryer in a like each floor of your house or if"
"17922740","17926340"," you're going to buy a house with a washer and dryer, make sure it has a tiled in or a"
"17926340","17930660"," membrane proofed space that they're on. "
"17930920","17932780"," So there's ever a leak that it drains."
"17941470","17943730"," Did I turn book map off earlier on you guys?"
"17944510","17945650"," Hopefully I didn't do that."
"17947870","17948590"," Looks good. "
"17948730","17949370"," Doesn't it pinky?"
"17950690","17951450"," Looks good."
"17951750","17952290"," A ton of work."
"17954030","17958630"," And then the basement's dry but so the basement's dry. "
"17959930","17962770"," But there's like Michigan's a weird place."
"17963050","17970930"," Like you could dig down if it's raining and snowing or if it's a river."
"17973750","17976230"," Detroit's famous for their sand. "
"17978070","17980110"," So their sand is very rare."
"17980530","17985470"," If you guys ever look up concrete mixes today, concrete mixes aren't that strong."
"17986210","17987630"," And it's due to the quality of sand. "
"17988910","17992270"," And they basically dredged it all up from Detroit, Michigan."
"17992950","17995190"," I'm not Michigan, but Detroit specifically because they have a bunch of rivers."
"17996150","18003190"," It's like special sand that has it's how it's structured as it grabs really well together with lime"
"18003190","18008330"," and Portland and rock sand. "
"18013710","18019230"," So if you dig down deep enough, you'll see literally like see a river running underneath"
"18019230","18020230"," everything."
"18020810","18027930"," So the basement's dry, but I've got humidity and I've got like it feels like the walls are moist a"
"18027930","18028710"," couple times a year."
"18029490","18035710"," So I don't need a sump pump, but I put one in as well. "
"18036170","18038790"," That's actually what the part of what these guys have been doing."
"18039370","18045650"," Putting a sump pit in with a alarm and also a nonsense."
"18046630","18047910"," And plus that's the other thing. "
"18048090","18054270"," Like I had to get a house didn't have a high efficiency furnace and air conditioning system to put"
"18054270","18055630"," that shit in and needs a drain."
"18057770","18063190"," And so I'm like, I'll use that for the drain for the for the for the furnace and for the"
"18063190","18063610"," AC."
"18064490","18071950"," Do you building a like building a modern house that's not builder grade is complicated and very"
"18071950","18072350"," expensive. "
"18074050","18077350"," Like a custom home, like a legit custom home is not cheap."
"18079770","18081670"," Especially at this is a century home."
"18081910","18083990"," So I make it's basically a brand new build. "
"18084110","18085850"," It's not even it's basically a brand new house."
"18086510","18088650"," It just looks like a century home on the outside."
"18089070","18094470"," The inside still has it, but it has that look still, but it's American four square. "
"18095810","18096630"," Three stories."
"18101840","18102580"," Yeah, yeah."
"18104340","18105980"," Put a laundry in the upper floor. "
"18106160","18107480"," Put an auto main water shut off."
"18107680","18107780"," Yep."
"18107960","18108520"," To your washer too. "
"18108640","18109040"," Absolutely."
"18111520","18114040"," Yeah, we're bears right now."
"18114760","18115660"," We're looking lower here. "
"18118360","18119660"," We're looking for that down there."
"18119840","18120240"," Release this."
"18121720","18122760"," That's what it's looking like. "
"18123080","18124160"," It's a very bearish look."
"18127780","18130400"," We can go up here, but it's bearish looking."
"18131080","18132640"," This is all looking pretty bearish. "
"18136860","18141620"," Oh, you got a four square?"
"18141920","18142020"," Yeah."
"18144120","18145480"," I got the it's great house."
"18145720","18148800"," It's got two front porches, two back. "
"18149020","18150460"," No, make these were January futures."
"18150780","18152980"," That's like $3.37 a gallon."
"18153160","18157180"," Economic gasoline January futures at $2.36 again. "
"18157700","18159180"," Early deco style."
"18161570","18162410"," The roof sucks."
"18162770","18163970"," The roof is like a 20 pitch. "
"18165190","18170950"," It's got a full walk, walk through attic, but I still put a full dormer on it."
"18171150","18172350"," So it's more even more space."
"18172630","18175050"," It should come out to like, I think what I'm done. "
"18176530","18183050"," It'll be somewhere between 26 and 32 hundred square feet."
"18184150","18187250"," So it'll be the right size for what people are looking for."
"18189670","18191130"," And I think I'm going to. "
"18191270","18193590"," I don't know exactly what I'm doing here."
"18193670","18194670"," I think I'm going to end up doing."
"18195910","18197530"," I was thinking about keeping this one. "
"18198490","18201370"," And I was thinking about building an in law apartment."
"18203450","18205890"," I don't know if I'm going to do this, but I was thinking about building."
"18205950","18210930"," No, make 32 my crude February futures settling at $78 and 96 a barrel. "
"18211550","18212550"," Squeeze and hire now."
"18213030","18215090"," I was thinking about building an in law apartment with."
"18218410","18222170"," For my daughter to go to college and will stay live in there. "
"18222870","18224630"," If she goes to, that's the other thing."
"18224770","18231350"," Our oldest daughter is more than likely going to have a free ride to University of Michigan."
"18232650","18233390"," It's a fairly good school. "
"18233830","18234370"," It's like top 100."
"18234710","18236230"," It's not great, but it's fairly good."
"18236230","18240110"," For public schools, it's very ranks high. "
"18240810","18241810"," Lots of engineers there."
"18243350","18249390"," But if she goes to like a Stanford or like a Ivy League or sub Ivy League or something, she"
"18249390","18250070"," won't be living there."
"18250250","18256330"," But if she takes it as a safety school, the other thing too is you them will probably offer a"
"18256330","18256770"," full ride. "
"18257470","18259170"," So it's all to what she wants to do."
"18259270","18261950"," If she wants to go there, I'll give her the apartment in the basement."
"18264550","18265730"," She moves away. "
"18266390","18270370"," Then I might still keep an apartment there for to come back to so she can't pay her way."
"18270930","18271890"," And she needs a place to live."
"18271890","18272510"," It'll be there for. "
"18273210","18281090"," And then I've got a two car garage in the back that I turned into a one car garage with"
"18281090","18282430"," workspace on each side."
"18283030","18288350"," I took out the big giant door and I put in a smaller door with a smaller garage door and"
"18288350","18288810"," a doorway."
"18288810","18296730"," I think I might turn that though into a caretakers house, like a carriage house. "
"18298870","18304570"," And what I was thinking was I was thinking was I do Airbnb at this house and I would move"
"18304570","18308170"," down south or out of the country."
"18309350","18314130"," And then do Airbnb and maybe let a caretaker live back there or maybe I come back to live there."
"18314610","18316210"," But I'm not sailing or whatever. "
"18316210","18322190"," I don't know exactly what the plan is in that yet, but this could be a I was thinking that"
"18322190","18323250"," I was that a couple thoughts."
"18323530","18329130"," I was like, if my daughter stayed here, she could be a caretaker or if I if I wanted to"
"18329130","18329590"," come back."
"18329870","18336030"," If I didn't buy something, if I just had the boat and sailed and then came back seasonally and"
"18336030","18337110"," spent maybe the winter. "
"18337110","18344310"," Well, not winters here, but like the the hurricane season, wherever the boats at, I would spend"
"18344310","18346010"," back here in Michigan."
"18346990","18349190"," In case they ever get hurt too, if you ever get hurt."
"18350890","18354490"," I don't know if some of you guys might know this, but in the United States, at least, if you're"
"18354490","18356790"," a US citizen, it doesn't really matter unless you're wealthy. "
"18357570","18358490"," I mean, wealthy."
"18359790","18364330"," If you have like debt of any kind, if you ever get hurt or something or you can't, you can't"
"18364330","18365010"," take care of yourself."
"18365590","18368730"," You want to have, you want to be able to take care of yourself, right?"
"18369410","18371990"," Not lose all your money to medical debt. "
"18372830","18374990"," Look at that big giant red bar right there."
"18376770","18377810"," Come on down, baby."
"18380210","18381250"," Come on down a day. "
"18381290","18382950"," I make natural gas January futures."
"18383210","18388310"," They said a lot $4.70. Come on down a day."
"18388530","18390090"," Slip right past that little green thing over there. "
"18391210","18395330"," I'm just going back to the Nijmek WTI crude settlement here."
"18395710","18399770"," So they're down 57 cents or about 7% on the session today."
"18400530","18403350"," Come on down. "
"18404550","18405530"," Come on down."
"18405770","18406570"," Say hello to me."
"18407790","18408990"," Come on down. "
"18410370","18411610"," Come on down."
"18415430","18416410"," That's where it is."
"18416670","18417150"," It's a great there. "
"18418570","18419510"," Right there."
"18423470","18424630"," Clean that up a little bit."
"18428090","18429610"," That's two touches down here. "
"18430630","18432770"," You want to see that break here when I get it."
"18434430","18437010"," I have one right there and now one right here."
"18437110","18437730"," I don't like seeing that. "
"18437810","18439270"," I want to see that rule right down here."
"18441730","18442170"," The."
"18446510","18447730"," That's a fuck kind of work. "
"18447730","18453790"," If I was flipping this house or something or like selling it or renting it out or something like"
"18453790","18455230"," that, I wouldn't be doing nearly what I'm doing."
"18455550","18458870"," Like I got 20 amp outlets everywhere."
"18459190","18461610"," I got fucking sub panel. "
"18461890","18462130"," I got."
"18462830","18467470"," I don't know how many amps they got running out to the garage."
"18467730","18469450"," A bunch of fucking power going to the garage. "
"18469790","18474330"," I got a race wave to run gas if I wanted to out there."
"18474330","18474810"," I've got."
"18477570","18478290"," Fuck me. "
"18478450","18481030"," Yeah, you know, like."
"18481570","18485370"," For building for myself for kind of like the last house lover build."
"18485890","18487310"," It's like very expensive. "
"18487670","18488990"," The breakers are expensive."
"18490850","18492770"," Like I got need water here."
"18492890","18493490"," Need water there. "
"18493930","18495910"," Oh, I need a electric outlet for the toilet."
"18496190","18497390"," Just in case you're going to put in a."
"18498910","18500470"," A fucking Japanese toilet."
"18500950","18501810"," That kind of shit like. "
"18504470","18505470"," It's not fucking cheap."
"18505830","18506150"," It's expensive."
"18507050","18507790"," It's so expensive. "
"18511670","18513390"," So I don't think I'll ever get that money back."
"18513790","18516690"," So I'm like, yeah, maybe I'll keep it and rent it out."
"18525630","18527930"," I suck a lot out of the second floor bedroom on the portrait. "
"18528170","18531310"," When I put it against the roof to walk up there, I said no and started cleaning the gutters."
"18531450","18532410"," My neighbor thought I was just cleaning."
"18532990","18533970"," Oh, I missed all that. "
"18534170","18537290"," What do you guys say up there?"
"18539090","18540250"," Prince for USO."
"18540490","18542310"," Nothing wrong with going to good state school."
"18542530","18545090"," Only top school in the schools that makes sense is for graduate degrees. "
"18545090","18547190"," That's what my sister did legal honesty."
"18547850","18550590"," My sister went to a normal school."
"18551210","18555830"," Then she went to Harvard for her graduate school and I was like, how the fuck did you get in"
"18555830","18555930"," there?"
"18556030","18556990"," And she's like, they take anybody. "
"18557790","18558450"," I'm like, you liar."
"18558630","18559650"," She's like, no, totally."
"18560210","18561690"," It was easy. "
"18568290","18571010"," Your oldest daughter is looking at Syracuse right on."
"18574970","18575670"," North Carolina."
"18575950","18576750"," Yeah, I looked at UNC. "
"18577970","18584650"," UNC is on our, I think we're down to like a top 10 or top 20 list and UNC is"
"18584650","18585170"," on that list."
"18585830","18586410"," That's one of them."
"18588770","18590830"," I'll stick a ladder at the second floor bedroom on the portrait. "
"18591190","18592870"," They put it against the roof to walk up there."
"18593030","18594890"," I said no and started cleaning the gutters."
"18595030","18596130"," My neighbor thought I was just cleaning. "
"18596750","18597470"," That's fucking hilarious."
"18603330","18607190"," If you've been planning the garage garage to a motor room office, I like it."
"18608210","18608890"," We did two. "
"18609650","18616490"," I did two office spaces in the basement because my kid's home school."
"18617310","18624130"," My wife is a remote athletic trainer, a kinesiologist, physical trainer for athletes and stuff."
"18626970","18632650"," But I think it can turn the office and the determinant bedrooms and make a small apartment. "
"18632910","18635410"," So if I could change the use on them."
"18637350","18642430"," Yeah, the full ride offer, I'm like, try to tell my daughter this."
"18642570","18644050"," I'm like, try to tell my daughter. "
"18644210","18645830"," I'm like, you don't want that fucking debt."
"18647570","18650050"," And then she's like, what if I get the full ride to a nice school?"
"18650050","18656690"," I'm like, dude, that's going to cost me like 20 grand a year, 15 grand a year."
"18657030","18661250"," So I went to UCLA and it was not cheap. "
"18662170","18663830"," The living in LA was not cheap."
"18665090","18665730"," I was in the army."
"18665870","18666410"," I went to UCLA. "
"18667290","18670490"," I was stationed with US Army Command for a time."
"18671630","18672750"," And I was getting my degree."
"18672890","18673470"," I was in the military. "
"18673690","18675310"," You could get your degree while you're in the military."
"18678450","18680870"," And you could get your degree paid for part of it."
"18681010","18682550"," But just the living expenses were stupid. "
"18685570","18687050"," Yeah, I got 240 volts everywhere."
"18688150","18693050"," Evan, I got a brand crude future set of $83.26 a barrel."
"18693290","18696970"," That's down $1.07. So one spot to 7% on the session. "
"18696970","18699430"," I ran 240 to the garage."
"18699870","18702410"," I ran 240 to the kitchen for double ovens."
"18702510","18704030"," I like double convection ovens. "
"18704630","18705910"," Ran 240."
"18707750","18713350"," I had 240 in the basement for dryer."
"18713450","18714130"," And I got rid of that. "
"18714330","18718530"," But then I added 240 outside for a potential hot tub."
"18719550","18720750"," But it's not connected."
"18721010","18722750"," It just ran the rough wiring. "
"18726970","18728190"," A few days are awesome."
"18728490","18730950"," If you guys have never been sat in a real bad day, like a good one."
"18731130","18732130"," Oh man, there's nothing like it. "
"18733130","18733670"," It's awesome."
"18734310","18734870"," I love the days."
"18738930","18739730"," Game changer. "
"18741070","18744950"," And you need to have like the warm spritz water, the warm air."
"18747090","18748690"," You need to have like all of it."
"18751370","18753550"," Like the total, the good total ones are outstanding. "
"18756870","18759830"," You live 10 minutes away from you and see right on."
"18760690","18762130"," I just bashed Harvard."
"18766750","18768610"," Nothing like fresh ass. "
"18771390","18772030"," Hello."
"18773270","18780670"," This is the spy in the E.S. many futures."
"18781910","18783330"," You lived in Syracuse for. "
"18787290","18792210"," Yeah, I like that."
"18792350","18794550"," Do you get like a, do you get like an in-state tuition?"
"18801880","18803140"," I'll look at UNG with you."
"18807200","18809960"," There was some natural gas news this morning, right?"
"18811800","18813240"," Oh yeah, I like that trade. "
"18823280","18824900"," I like UNG."
"18830300","18837200"," It's way out of a, I think we, so on, on boil, we had a potential."
"18838420","18842620"," So on boil, I charted it out a few weeks ago and. "
"18845520","18850240"," From what I've got here, I had a lower price target of 1701."
"18850240","18853640"," And it just hit 1802."
"18854540","18857560"," So it's pretty fucking close horseshoes and hand grenades. "
"18858960","18863380"," For UNG to, you might get one more down day on UNG, but."
"18864580","18865900"," So I'm on boil."
"18866140","18868320"," I've got 1701 as a buy. "
"18873300","18876700"," And so I think it bounced at 1802 today."
"18877520","18878220"," I'm a low."
"18885700","18886880"," Squeeze and I are down the spot. "
"18888100","18889500"," There's a little double bottom down here."
"18891760","18893280"," A little tiny double bottom right here."
"18917500","18918240"," Yeah, I love it. "
"18918340","18920160"," They open and close automatically and flush automatically."
"18920160","18921020"," I love it."
"18921300","18923720"," Like I love the more options, the better I go to a place. "
"18924760","18925580"," What do I go to?"
"18925720","18926880"," A place called 10,000 waves."
"18927120","18929680"," And that's where I found the best, not even Japan."
"18929940","18931360"," The best ones I've seen were in the US. "
"18937060","18938020"," Cats not sound."
"18940240","18941660"," Do I try to tell people this?"
"18942220","18947560"," If you've ever used the bidet, it's like an experience your first time."
"18947720","18949580"," You're like, what the fuck was that?"
"18951000","18953700"," You got like, it's like straight pampering. "
"18954260","18956380"," It's like you went to a massage therapist or something."
"18956740","18960160"," And you get out of there, you want to get in there and they got like, if you go to"
"18960160","18965280"," a Japanese place or whatever, they'll have like the room heated, the floor is heated."
"18966040","18972460"," They have these Japanese showers with like stools and cold plunges and all kinds of bad ass shit. "
"18973800","18975820"," And be a little bit of a double bottom right here."
"18978260","18979680"," You can see it right there."
"18989780","18991420"," Just burning calls and puts down. "
"18993820","18996020"," There's nothing like, there's nothing like a bidet."
"19001620","19003380"," Yeah, Evan, that's what I did, man."
"19003540","19008600"," I ran a bunch of like, I, matter of fact, I've got wires still dangling in the basement that I"
"19008600","19009040"," haven't connected. "
"19009440","19010260"," They're just there."
"19011200","19017400"," So I'm going to roll them up and stick them up in there and just label them."
"19017400","19018640"," Uranus massages. "
"19021340","19022100"," Let's look at Dixie."
"19022520","19025360"," You know, it sucks because Dixie, I'm not trusting it like I once did."
"19078920","19080500"," Yeah, I mean, Dixie is looking. "
"19080500","19085260"," Came back up, sold down, sold down."
"19085480","19087020"," This is constructive for Dixie."
"19088280","19093360"," I mean, if you were Dixie is bad for the stock market. "
"19094480","19099220"," So if this is a typical stock, this is what you want to see, right?"
"19100260","19104740"," Sold it down, but you want to see the break above this downtrend."
"19104740","19109680"," And then you want to see constructive consolidation."
"19112100","19113540"," And then some legs higher here. "
"19116500","19117780"," That's really what you want to see."
"19120580","19122320"," This is bad for US stocks."
"19127860","19130240"," See, we've had the consolidation at this point. "
"19166740","19170340"," I'll tell you what, it's a lot of work needs done."
"19170500","19172040"," There's a lot of selling up here."
"19173260","19174540"," I'm not that bullish on Dixie. "
"19174720","19175340"," I'll be honest with you."
"19178300","19180920"," I'm saying I'm bullish here in Dixie, but I'm really not."
"19186320","19188460"," You sell it as a weighting up here for you. "
"19193620","19197340"," I think any attempt up here is going to get whacked down."
"19197340","19199120"," Do you want to start getting bearish like bear town?"
"19202520","19206960"," Down, down, down, down."
"19209700","19213100"," If you want some real bear town, it's anything above here. "
"19213100","19242480"," I'll"
"19242480","19242480"," move bear town now."
"19257040","19259200"," I think this gets sold off."
"19259660","19260500"," I don't think it. "
"19269160","19272720"," You want to see constructiveness."
"19273020","19278040"," You want to see that should have been green, not red."
"19278860","19279800"," This could be red or green. "
"19280080","19289840"," It depends on how you're viewing this, but you at least want to see"
"19289840","19291980"," something like this."
"19291980","19295120"," Push above, at least try to break this."
"19295700","19298560"," You'd need that into March. "
"19298740","19299980"," There's going to be a grind right here."
"19301160","19310960"," I think unless these sellers aren't here any longer, there's a lot of pressure here to sell."
"19311860","19314160"," It's implied that there's a lot of pressure there to sell. "
"19314920","19324680"," But this is constructive for a leg higher on a move higher on Dixie."
"19326060","19330920"," This looks a lot less stronger when you're consolidating over here."
"19340920","19343800"," I just keep selling the rips, selling the rips. "
"19347820","19351160"," Check this green line right here to see if this helps for a rip higher to the bell."
"19380490","19382830"," I haven't looked at HYG yet."
"19387610","19389430"," HYG is very bearish. "
"19404350","19414110"," It's very bearish, but at this previous slowdown here in HYG, previous flow back here in"
"19414110","19418690"," HYG, better fucking hope it doesn't come down here."
"19427390","19433570"," I hope there's a reaction down here at $72.95 on HYG."
"19438230","19442590"," Take a look at TLT is below $100"
"19442590","19456570"," now. "
"19457270","19459750"," We're still selling our TLT as well."
"19460350","19463330"," I didn't take a position here, but it looked good this morning."
"19463910","19464930"," That was a nice progress. "
"19465710","19467250"," This is good progress right here."
"19469630","19470990"," It looks good at least."
"19472630","19474350"," I still don't have a position here. "
"19474450","19478870"," I'm not going to take a position here until I see some kind of reversal."
"19479590","19480770"," You can see when it happens."
"19482010","19483750"," You can see previously when it happened. "
"19484190","19486210"," You can actually see the right here."
"19487350","19491890"," You can actually see at least on an hourly, you can see when we trade above it."
"19494650","19496330"," We'll see we trade below it. "
"19496890","19502930"," We trade above it, trade below it, trade above the hourly."
"19512150","19516670"," We're still below the hourly right now, so we'll look for some lower loads."
"19517150","19523090"," We'll look for $97.69 to probably put another. "
"19527250","19529970"," I love this ticker, to be honest with you."
"19533410","19535210"," Nice slow-moving ticker, it's like AMD."
"19541290","19542370"," Still in cell mode. "
"19543690","19550690"," Get a little bit of roll here in cell mode."
"19554430","19555430"," This looks like a cell man."
"19555750","19557430"," This whole thing looks like a cell still. "
"19558250","19559490"," Nothing here is fucking saying."
"19566190","19569130"," Now you're going to be looking for down here to close this gap."
"19572410","19574350"," There's another fucking gap down here too. "
"19575490","19577070"," This is October over here."
"19579490","19580930"," This is a big move."
"19582890","19587550"," This actually represents quite well the move that took place today. "
"19588710","19594650"," When we couldn't get above here, the option to close this gap, you were told no."
"19596210","19599690"," Just like easy, peasy kind of stuff."
"19599990","19603870"," If you thought this was where supply was, supply was right here. "
"19605850","19611950"," If we're not going to close the gap above, we're going to close the fucking gap below, which is"
"19611950","19612410"," down here."
"19616370","19623090"," You could possibly get a double top here, but it doesn't fucking matter."
"19623090","19623770"," We're going down. "
"19626030","19627670"," Fucking sellers are in charge here."
"19630550","19633190"," That's pretty fucking bearish right there."
"19635550","19638670"," You can see the one hour curling over on it too, right?"
"19638970","19642550"," See the one hour just coming up, getting right on top of it. "
"19645510","19646350"," It's bearish."
"19646790","19648670"," I don't care what you say, it's fucking bearish."
"19649890","19653570"," The good thing about this being bearish is you want to..."
"19653570","19659190"," XLU is one of the last sectors of supply for us to sell. "
"19660810","19662430"," I'd be monitoring XLU."
"19668030","19668690"," Bearish, baby."
"19669550","19671350"," I don't know what anyone says we are right now. "
"19671770","19672630"," Today we're bearish."
"19674090","19675750"," Prepareish unless something changes on the hourly."
"19688550","19689570"," Consolidation on Dixie. "
"19690410","19692470"," XLU starting to roll, we want to see that."
"19692470","19702290"," It usually signifies the last part of like a monthly"
"19702290","19706630"," rollover."
"19728870","19729870"," It's a pretty good day today. "

"19784150","19786090"," S&P is my life right now."
"19787850","19788690"," Have it. "
"19789010","19789930"," Have it yet."
"19796410","19798670"," There's a convergence on Tesla."
"19801570","19804110"," Tesla can go up. "
"19805750","19807310"," I don't see the divergence though."
"19808350","19809910"," I see the selling right now."
"19812310","19817930"," It's the one minute chart and the one minute I see selling on the five minute I see selling on"
"19817930","19818190"," Tesla. "
"19819550","19824830"," And on the one hour I see looking to start selling."
"19827270","19828330"," It's still fighting."
"19829830","19830710"," It's still fighting. "
"19831330","19836690"," I still have a price target down below of 1996 or something down here."
"19836850","19839350"," I don't know where the fuck that thing is."
"19839530","19840190"," Where did it go?"
"19846050","19847670"," Sometimes this shit doesn't show up. "
"19848430","19850430"," I don't know why it's not showing."
"19851490","19853010"," I still have a price target down here."
"19853810","19854750"," I don't know if I delete it. "
"19854750","19860590"," I think I've cleared the entire chart for you guys, but right down here."
"19861650","19862810"," That's where it's at right there."
"19865730","19866890"," 9570 I think it is. "
"19872210","19878070"," Yeah, just selling."
"19879990","19881270"," 367 down here."
"19881770","19887470"," According to US health officials, all air passengers from China age two and older will be required"
"19887470","19891870"," to get a COVID test two days before departure from China starting at January the 5th. "
"19906240","19907780"," Where's the one hour at on?"
"19908920","19909900"," Still up there."
"19910420","19911980"," So it's coming down right now."
"19912060","19914040"," You see the one hour coming down. "
"19915860","19918120"," One hour just keeps coming down coming down farther."
"19918460","19918960"," So we're going to move."
"19919980","19922700"," We're actually going to get rid of that yellow. "
"19923120","19924640"," We're going to move that red bar down."
"19927160","19928480"," It's just coming right down."
"19931240","19933340"," That one hour trend has changed as well. "
"19933520","19936480"," It's now 379 or so somewhere in there."
"19936480","19939700"," 380, 64 it says, but it's come down."
"19941300","19942600"," I guess we can do that one. "
"19947440","19949860"," So this red box just keeps coming down and coming down."
"19950920","19953000"," It's going to be looking for another sell at some point."

"20178190","20178830"," Talk."
"20188930","20190630"," What that new low down here. "
"20192450","20194690"," What that new bear slow down here."
"20196750","20198990"," What that new low down here."
"20200830","20201430"," What that new"
"20201430","20228870"," low"
"20228870","20228970"," down here. "
"20228970","20239950"," What"
"20239950","20242430"," that new low down here."
"20242430","20242790"," What that new low."
"20255710","20256310"," Apple. "
"20260470","20265550"," Didn't we just have a conversation about we won't be seeing 120."
"20266750","20268130"," Can we just have that conversation?"
"20276230","20278210"," We just had that conversation didn't we?"
"20285170","20286890"," I thought we just had that conversation."
"20286890","20296510"," I think one of our last conversations was I"
"20296510","20305870"," don't care what the retracement is up here. "
"20309410","20312570"," I don't care what the last retracement is."
"20313190","20315730"," I don't care if it's here, here, here."
"20316970","20318610"," I was like that shit's coming back down. "
"20324270","20327910"," 122 next stop 117."
"20331790","20333890"," You can see it on the open today, right?"
"20334230","20334950"," You can see it right here."
"20336190","20337690"," This is the last hope. "
"20338810","20340130"," It didn't happen."
"20340690","20344410"," It doesn't mean we don't retrace, but doors wide open down below."
"20349250","20350890"," I'm bearish on apple. "
"20353510","20356670"," That was the switch this one right here was the key right up in here."
"20365010","20367390"," Come on down."
"20392690","20393970"," Hey, how you guys all doing up there?"
"20398670","20405190"," Yeah, we pretty much if you're here earlier, we traded this up right here, we traded this down. "
"20405690","20407210"," We traded this up right here."
"20408070","20409650"," We knew to take profits right here."
"20410850","20412130"," We traded this down. "
"20413670","20416330"," I think even ran a put play over here at some point."
"20419250","20425150"," Price target below is right now currently, right here for new low."
"20426330","20428510"," I don't know if we get this S3 down here. "
"20429170","20431490"," It'd be nice if we got it, but I don't know if we'll get it."
"20431670","20435890"," I think it'll be good enough if you get the new low on 3733."
"20436710","20439270"," It might not get this is kind of like the expected. "
"20440290","20445510"," And down here is kind of like maybe sometimes you get it like last 15 minutes."
"20446230","20449930"," You'll get like sometimes you get it sometimes you don't."
"20450010","20452390"," Those just really run it back up or trade sideways. "
"20453350","20455470"," They really want the new low right here."
"20455810","20456990"," So that's all you really need."
"20458650","20460890"," Sometimes you get the bloodbath down to the bell. "
"20461250","20465430"," You can hold your puts for right into the into the close and then you monetize them."
"20466550","20469930"," You can even hold for another 15 minutes to get down there to S3."
"20470670","20471330"," Could happen. "
"20472150","20473610"," Could happen after the bell."
"20477990","20486070"," Probably anticipating another two legs down and one decent retracement, but probably two more legs"
"20486070","20486470"," down."
"20487890","20489690"," Unless some happens that we don't know. "
"20490070","20490610"," You never know."
"20491830","20493790"," Coming into the month, it's a craziness happens."
"20494630","20495910"," They buy the entire market. "
"20496070","20496570"," We don't know it."
"20497330","20497930"," It's possible."
"20499170","20503250"," Get the magnet to 3823 or whatever it is for JPM caller. "
"20504170","20507890"," Other than that, the market's nice and selling right now."
"20525030","20526030"," Powerly is all negative."
"20526530","20527490"," Four hours negative. "
"20528730","20529730"," Fifteen minutes negative."
"20530090","20531470"," Nothing's really positive right now."
"20533950","20535810"," Then we get some cool stuff down here. "
"20536930","20540950"," As we get down to figure where it was, but it's like three."
"20541230","20542190"," We talked about it earlier today."
"20542330","20544850"," There's a weekly moving average down here. "
"20545850","20548950"," So we can get closer and closer to that weekly moving average."
"20550050","20555730"," It's going to be a nice answer for if we bounce or if we slip beneath it."
"20557410","20559130"," That might be where the retracement is. "
"20564610","20566710"," Now we're touching right now for the new low."
"20567970","20569610"," Hopefully we can get it here in a few seconds."
"20574990","20576430"," That took all fucking day. "
"20576630","20577170"," How long did that take?"
"20579810","20581310"," It took fucking forever."
"20584030","20587650"," It took like 45 minutes just to do this move right here."
"20590170","20594710"," You'd be taking profit somewhere in here. "
"20595350","20599750"," Even if it breaks that new low, it could slam back up faster than you can monetize."
"20604230","20605790"," We're coming into it right now."
"20606450","20608770"," It's always better to monetize as we break through right here. "
"20616830","20618820"," Let me show it a little bit better here on BookMap."
"20619550","20621230"," Power is a little bit more to go down here."
"20623590","20624770"," We just got the new low. "
"20626330","20630490"," And then you're going to be looking for a rejection above here."
"20633250","20635890"," We'll do is we'll change this to, or not change."
"20636130","20641530"," We're going to add in a little red box right here. "
"20643430","20646310"," Then we come back down and tag this next."
"20646670","20647810"," We'll see if we can or can't."
"20648490","20650070"," It'll be the money shot down below. "
"20656650","20659550"," We're going to hope for the rest of it right here and see if we can get it right here."
"20659550","20665330"," Just noting losses extended in US stocks here with the S&P down over 1% on the session now."
"20670180","20672440"," We ain't done selling, baby. "
"20673480","20677100"," 377.14, nice new fat low with conviction."
"20682420","20689860"," Looking to some analyst notes on the US markets at the moment, a holiday trading is treasury yields"
"20689860","20690440"," ticked higher."
"20690900","20693380"," Let's hope for a third year and rally have faltered. "
"20694200","20699260"," The S&P 500 coughed up and early advanced after sentiment worsened on concerns at the end of"
"20699260","20700860"," China's zero COVID policy."
"20701320","20703860"," It could lead to a rising cases around the world."
"20704540","20705060"," A trading volume. "
"20705400","20706560"," Don't believe that for a minute."
"20706840","20708160"," That's the reason that we sold there."
"20709060","20710180"," That's not why we sold. "
"20710280","20710800"," It wasn't COVID."
"20712900","20714500"," That's just the excuse that was used."
"20715900","20720840"," If we've got up, they would have said the US stock market shrugged off COVID concerns in China. "
"20724560","20725360"," Can't play that."
"20725440","20726440"," I had to mute that shit."
"20726520","20727220"," Just not the reason. "
"20737940","20744480"," Do you like it?"
"20745120","20746000"," Do you like the show?"
"20756860","20758260"," I'm not saying everything you guys are saying."
"20758540","20760240"," I only see parts, so I only sell the one thing."
"20765440","20766980"," I need to test the players in the close. "
"20767460","20767780"," Fuck no."
"20769640","20771440"," Fuck no, there's no test the players in the close."
"20772400","20772720"," Hell no. "
"20777420","20781160"," You'd be lucky if you see Tesla trade sideways for the next fucking week or two."
"20783640","20784480"," Hell no."
"20797000","20798300"," Put spreads now. "
"20799320","20801740"," You don't look for retracement here at some point."
"20802480","20806360"," Hopefully a retracement to this big red bar right here."
"20806480","20807640"," You can get a retracement here. "
"20810280","20816300"," What you're looking for for the next nice bear trade here is some kind of retracement."
"20816300","20819860"," If you can get it up here to sell that down right there."
"20821340","20826480"," None of this is worth other than closing positions down here or letting some runners run. "
"20829340","20833360"," I'm looking for something over here to grab to go short once again."
"20860290","20860830"," Right on."
"20861190","20861490"," Yeah. "
"20861570","20862530"," I didn't see everything you're posting."
"20862690","20864690"," All I saw was just said something that that was funny."
"20864950","20868350"," I was like right on. "
"20877250","20877610"," 378."
"20878070","20878830"," 93 right now."
"20879970","20880670"," Trade and hire. "
"20880910","20881950"," Look for rejection up here."
"20882050","20883790"," We can get this rejection for this last little bit."
"20883950","20884610"," You might not get it. "
"20885250","20890770"," Same here earlier that kind of like this is the trade is really done right here."
"20890990","20892630"," Because you got the new low on the day."
"20892790","20893470"," It's very bearish. "
"20893610","20893690"," Right."
"20895490","20897110"," And sometimes though you will."
"20897290","20901590"," Sometimes you'll get this last little into the clothes slam down here. "
"20901590","20902010"," You get 376."
"20902530","20905470"," You might even get like some blood into 415."
"20905870","20907630"," These are all gimmes though. "
"20908210","20910830"," So we'll be relying upon this happening into the clothes."
"20912310","20913190"," But you do want to see it."
"20914490","20915590"," So we'll see if this. "
"20915870","20918490"," If you get a nice rejection right here."
"20919570","20922370"," And if they're going to send it down or not."
"20926650","20927090"," 1520. "
"20928590","20929470"," 317 now."
"20929710","20930810"," So if you're a bull."
"20930970","20932530"," If this was an upside down chart and you're a bull. "
"20933370","20935110"," You'd be like this is done here."
"20935770","20938510"," It doesn't mean you'll go crazy high into the clothes."
"20938870","20940770"," But typically you're done right around that 320. "
"20942490","20944270"," If you're moving down into that."
"20945410","20946130"," Part of the hour."
"20957730","20960170"," We'll see if we can reject and get that last little trade in here. "
"20962730","20963950"," There's no strength from bulls."
"20964350","20965490"," I saw someone comment about that."
"20965590","20966270"," There's no buyers here. "
"20967350","20968390"," This is all sell sell sell sell."
"20970030","20972170"," There's more than likely just bears waiting to."
"20972770","20975090"," So if this red bar right here is the hourly. "
"20975330","20977210"," It's been coming down all day long."
"20977390","20977890"," All day long."
"20978550","20980910"," So you've got major sellers just waiting up here. "
"20981890","20983630"," So if you get a retracement up here."
"20985630","20987510"," You know this waiting for you."
"20988110","20989850"," Even the five minute they're waiting for you. "
"20999310","21000310"," And you'll see this."
"21004690","21005610"," You're just joining."
"21005850","21007950"," I didn't know that some of you guys are just joining us. "
"21008070","21009110"," So if you're just joining us."
"21009710","21013890"," You can teen off on this on this big blue line all day long."
"21041050","21042530"," And this morning we went over the. "
"21042990","21045130"," If you just try to get to me guys just joining us now."
"21045130","21045750"," Is that what's going"
"21045750","21058370"," on."
"21059830","21060750"," Tesla is like. "
"21060990","21063870"," Well we can tell you guys want to know more about Tesla for the future."
"21064090","21065030"," We can we can look at it."
"21065090","21065870"," I get you guys want to. "
"21066130","21066870"," So on Tesla."
"21071250","21072750"," We'll just look at Tesla right here right."
"21073370","21073870"," Let's look at it. "
"21074350","21075490"," Let's look at a few different ways."
"21075690","21075750"," Okay."
"21075870","21077170"," Let's start the five minute chart right. "
"21079650","21080010"," Test."
"21080190","21084050"," There's a couple of things that 200 simple moving average is supportive of Tesla."
"21084310","21086230"," This is positive for Tesla. "
"21086430","21087710"," This doesn't mean that Tesla's."
"21087710","21090570"," So if the spies going to go down Tesla could."
"21091830","21095490"," Theoretically is looking like it just trades sideways as we move into some accumulation. "
"21096930","21099310"," But it doesn't mean it's going to go up and go crazy either."
"21099650","21101410"," I'll show you another example of that happening."
"21102070","21103330"," Machine example of this. "
"21106490","21107870"," Sounds like a sideways trade."
"21109330","21112110"," But even with that being said on the one hour."
"21113950","21116430"," You know typically when you see this in a one hour. "
"21118670","21120970"," You know this consolidation right here right."
"21121190","21122330"," You might be like oh that's bullish."
"21123070","21125910"," But even if it is bullish you can't take the trade with conviction. "
"21126750","21128750"," Unless you break above does that make sense."
"21128970","21131150"," You put your finger on the call on the call trigger."
"21131330","21132990"," But you don't buy it until it starts ripping. "
"21135110","21138490"," You can buy the dips down here and sell the rips by the dip seller."
"21138670","21139310"," By the dip seller."
"21139570","21140090"," By the dip seller. "
"21140270","21140970"," All the kind of stuff."
"21141350","21142870"," You can't take a position here."
"21143370","21144290"," Until you break below. "
"21144290","21146390"," So you can see it right on the hourly."
"21148960","21153580"," The thought process would be that if spies really weak you might just see this kind of nonsense in"
"21153580","21154020"," here right."
"21155280","21156080"," It's possible. "
"21160280","21161560"," On a four hour chart."
"21163980","21167320"," You know trend is still down so far in the four hour."
"21167400","21168220"," This is the big trend. "
"21169960","21172440"," And you know you haven't even broken that yet."
"21172440","21176340"," So even if you were to take the one hour trend and you break above it."
"21176360","21178040"," You can only take that trade right there. "
"21178660","21180540"," You want to see like Tesla."
"21181700","21182860"," Find some ground."
"21182860","21184140"," Find some support. "
"21184400","21185200"," Find some believers."
"21186700","21188360"," That's your second part of your trade right there."
"21191840","21193460"," And I'll show you another ticker. "
"21197600","21198400"," That's similar."
"21198400","21201340"," Look at a similar ticker here."
"21203870","21205470"," And you have a bloodbath here right. "
"21214530","21216910"," Some consolidation more selling right."
"21217130","21218730"," Consolidate, consolidate, consolidate."
"21219270","21219730"," Lift the buyer. "
"21220430","21222210"," Solid new lower high."
"21224010","21227090"," And what's happening here is you've got trap buyers up here."
"21227810","21229050"," And they're just like get me out. "
"21229350","21229950"," Get me out please."
"21230230","21230530"," I don't care."
"21230690","21231150"," Just get me out. "
"21231150","21232490"," So until you get enough."
"21233650","21234530"," Exhaustion of sellers."
"21235650","21238470"," Will you be able to make that that trip higher. "
"21239010","21242670"," And let's look at how long that took when you're talking about a year."
"21245600","21246760"," It's fucking year right there."
"21249860","21250380"," Year. "
"21251940","21256220"," This could be the spy for if we can't get a market."
"21256480","21258120"," If we can't get unemployment numbers up."
"21258920","21259740"," Like up. "
"21260360","21263100"," You can see spy trade like this for an entire year."
"21263680","21267120"," And they'll wait until the numbers come in to get those unemployment numbers out."
"21267260","21268440"," Then you'll have one last plunge. "
"21270660","21272700"," And then the market will actually go up."
"21273520","21281420"," This is actually pretty close to a very probable path for the S&P 500 for 2023."
"21296960","21298620"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"21300160","21303840"," Oh, yeah."
"21307370","21309270"," Gotta come back and show us up."
"21316430","21319250"," Blood, bright red blood. "
"21326170","21327570"," Oh, yeah."
"21334430","21336210"," We got the drips down here."
"21341390","21343910"," I don't know if we got the drips down there. "
"21350430","21351930"," Bright red blood."
"21363830","21365350"," Yeah, there's no hope here."
"21367390","21369490"," There's no hope if you're a bull. "
"21374870","21377910"," Any hope that you had, I'm going to warn you of this right now."
"21378330","21382810"," Any hope that you had, you're going to see like 385, 388."
"21383290","21384470"," This fucking shit's gone. "
"21385210","21386630"," You ain't seeing that this year."
"21387270","21391230"," I'll put a fucking 90% bet that that doesn't fulfill for you."
"21391890","21393010"," 90% chance. "
"21393690","21397570"," You ain't seeing 385 in 2023."
"21409650","21411110"," Burn it for the queen, baby."
"21421750","21423190"," We've had a great center rally this year. "
"21423890","21425210"," Carl's saying, what about center rally?"
"21425490","21426610"," Center rally is fucking awesome."

"21441870","21443590"," Well, you want to see a center fucking rally?"
"21443750","21444470"," I'll say a center rally. "
"21445350","21446690"," Right fucking there is awesome."

"21453070","21455110"," This is where you said we were getting a market crash."
"21455350","21455970"," That didn't happen. "
"21458370","21459410"," This is where it went up."
"21460610","21461170"," It went up."

"21468010","21469430"," It was amazing. "
"21473050","21475470"," It was absolutely stunning."
"21475690","21479730"," As a matter of fact, you haven't even gone into the first of the year."
"21480590","21482890"," You haven't even come back to revisit this shit. "

"21971750","21977570"," it's worth taking the trade down there but you have to trade at level to level is the point you"
"21977570","21985010"," can only trade levels I'm a well I trade from level level I don't I'm not like these or I"
"21985010","21991130"," don't trade level level so here I'll bring this last half an hour because some of you guys probably"
"21991130","22000730"," joining us first time I'll bring this up so okay so mark these words okay"
"22000730","22006690"," mark these words write this down your little your little black book somewhere"
"22006690","22016410"," so the market can actually trade sideways and up the next"
"22016410","22025710"," year believe it or not and still have not seen bottom so absorb that the market can trade sideways"
"22025710","22035230"," and up the next year and still have not seen a bloodbath but there will be attempts"
"22035230","22044410"," made this year for a bloodbath in 2023 so the best the bull could hope for would be that we"
"22044410","22053810"," trade it sideways and hopefully from a bull's perspective would be hopefully sideways and slightly"
"22053810","22060210"," up so that when we get that last capitulation move in the market it won't be as interesting your"
"22060210","22064410"," stocks are standing there always on the session today worth noting the shares of Apple are down"
"22064410","22069990"," around 3% which is on track for the lowest close in June of 2021 sweet shares of Amazon as"
"22069990","22076110"," well down around one spot 2% they're on track for the lowest close since around March of 2019 so"
"22076110","22082450"," you're so you're looking for like mark those words it's very possible and probable that our market"
"22082450","22086890"," could trade sideways and even slightly up if the market believes that the Fed is doing what they're"
"22086890","22093790"," supposed to do that's probably that's probably if you know like J-POW should cut rates now he's"
"22093790","22099290"," he's I think that because he hasn't cut rates that he's trying to pull the Volcker move which is"
"22099290","22105010"," the market will actually go up for a year sideways and up until we get out of the unemployment rate"
"22105010","22112450"," high enough to find a bottom now so with that being caveat being said if you're a bull you're not"
"22112450","22119410"," going to expect the market to go up unless you see certain things where you can own stock with no"
"22119410","22124370"," worries you're not going to care about price you're not going to care about where we wind up you"
"22124370","22133530"," don't care about 3100 or 2400 or 1400 or 1600 the place for you to buy the market place for"
"22133530","22143910"," you to buy market with with no fear is yeah"
"22143910","22147410"," I'll just do it you know what I'll just do with you guys I'll do it on screen with you"
"22147410","22155450"," guys so the place for you to buy the market with no fear is that that's a big 500"
"22155450","22162110"," I think the weekly is fine so I'm going to add me I'm going to mute my I'm going to"
"22162110","22170910"," mute a couple of things here well here webcam frame"
"22170910","22180190"," and hook map so you guys can see the entire thing so it I'm gonna give you both pulls from"
"22180190","22186970"," bears here so so pulls are looking for coming into the air we'll do this now so we're gonna do"
"22186970","22192190"," the fed funds rate effective fund fed funds rate and new pain you can see it take a snapshot come"
"22192190","22199610"," back and look at this video later you get the unemployment rate right here new pain right and then"
"22199610","22206970"," we've got inflation right this is the US IR Y what Y Y here every year new pain right there"
"22206970","22216250"," okay this is the fed funds rate this is unemployment this is inflation okay"
"22216250","22224910"," now you want to see feds fund rate is high which is good you're seeing this you're gonna expect"
"22224910","22233690"," rate cuts you should be if you're a bear bull I don't care you're expecting rate cuts with whether"
"22233690","22241090"," fed funds rate is there's a caveat to this too the Volcker move would be to continue to raise rates"
"22241090","22250790"," the market would actually respond high or sideways and up for 2023 and the reason being is uh you"
"22250790","22257730"," don't you see unemployment so this is a good positive for bulls our inflation is coming down I"
"22257730","22261250"," don't want to hear anything that you guys have to say about let's break down inflation let's break"
"22261250","22266970"," down CPI and TPI I don't want to hear that shit this is what they're looking for right here but"
"22266970","22271390"," what I want you to notice is we don't have a high unemployment rate and if you had seen a"
"22271390","22276530"," high unemployment rate right now if you say this fed funds rate where it is if you saw this rolling"
"22276530","22282910"," over you look now to the early market on closing balance it is still sitting at 300 and turn that"
"22282910","22288490"," shit off you would expect a bottom right now or at least a plunge to a bottom like right now"
"22288490","22294730"," you'd expect that we're not seeing that and the that's why the fed is in this this weird place"
"22294730","22298750"," right there's they should be cutting rates here but we should be seeing unemployment coming up"
"22298750","22304430"," we're not seeing it come up there are times in his historically where unemployment has not come up"
"22304430","22311890"," and the fed fund rate has continued to go up or plateaued as long as the market believes the fed"
"22311890","22315870"," that's why I don't think the fed is actually fighting inflation or fighting unemployment or"
"22315870","22321130"," fighting to raise unemployment or they're not at least telling mainstream USA but if the if the"
"22321130","22326390"," market believed they were doing this then quote air quotes week the market could actually go up in"
"22326390","22332050"," sideways now it doesn't really matter where we go here but does matter is doesn't matter if we go"
"22332050","22338910"," if it doesn't matter we slip let me get an indicator in here we'll have a second here well weekly"
"22338910","22346190"," moving average right there now the key part of this is see where we are in this weekly moving"
"22346190","22354050"," average and I'm going to also bring up just a moving average okay you can always come back and do"
"22354050","22362850"," this on your own so I'll make this a 50 right here I'm going to make the style uh thicker"
"22362850","22371890"," I'm going to make it a yellow line right here okay okay so you don't want to see this here"
"22371890","22376170"," you don't want to see this yellow line coming down you don't want to see this confluence you want"
"22376170","22380210"," to see this confluence because we slip underneath here right we're going to be trading sideways"
"22380210","22387210"," until we finally see this rate come up the unemployment rate when you see that rate come up you're"
"22387210","22392190"," going to see one last plunge down and that's going to be the bottom that a bull could buy in"
"22392190","22399330"," safety this white here book bears say we're not done going down uh now when that happens nobody"
"22399330","22405350"," knows right we could end up if they raise the break some more if the market believes if we're"
"22405350","22412610"," oversold on a yearly there's all kinds of reasons why we could still trade up here in sideways but"
"22412610","22416370"," they're still going to wait for this to happen here so if you want to if you want to be"
"22416370","22426090"," a bottom buyer with with no worries this is what you're looking for is this right here historically"
"22426090","22435870"," we've had times in history where the market has gone up sorry there hold on here"
"22435870","22443710"," there have been times that we have historical precedents of times in the future come on where the"
"22443710","22450370"," market will actually go up here if the if the market believes the Fed Spiding stuff and then you'd"
"22450370","22455110"," see this rate come up and this rate come down and you'd think oh it's over we're going to blast"
"22455110","22461350"," to the moon here but we don't we actually still crash so you're looking for this thing right here"
"22461350","22469150"," if you see this thing right here that's what a bull's looking for and that's why we that the"
"22469150","22473950"," problem here too is they keep saying we have to fight inflation it's kind of fight inflation with"
"22473950","22480250"," fight inflation but that's not really what they have to fight they need unemployment to rise and"
"22480250","22485210"," they can't tell Main Street USA that they can't be like they can't be like yeah we we need to"
"22485210","22492410"," destroy some jobs around here we need to destroy jobs they're not going to tell you that they're"
"22492410","22498230"," not going to put their newspaper you're not going to find Janet Yellen lying yelling on 60 minutes"
"22498230","22503410"," and tell you that they need you to lose your job that we need you to lose your house and"
"22503410","22507510"," your car and your wife and your dog and all that other shit they're not going to tell you that"
"22507510","22513270"," but when you see that as a bull that's what you're looking for right there you see that shit that's"
"22513270","22519190"," when you buy Tesla and you're like i'm in it's when you buy every company that you love you you're"
"22519190","22524930"," you're a rock star you're happy bull you're super super happy now as a bear you get fucked here too"
"22524930","22531890"," right because you could see this market trade sideways for a year and what you're really looking"
"22531890","22537190"," for is this move up you should be all eyes on unemployment at all times this should be your jam"
"22537190","22541970"," right here you don't care about this bullshit over here care about this one you see that one go up"
"22541970","22550130"," you're going to see a fucking meltdown on the market i like a full-on meltdown so that's my take"
"22550130","22555150"," on it it could be wrong but if you look back historically you do this on your own right what"
"22555150","22558590"," i want you to do for homework is you make one of these charts and i want you to go"
"22558590","22564790"," back and see the divergences i want you to see where you see unemployment spike right you see the"
"22564790","22570750"," fed cut cut rates just prior right you see inflation rolling down i want you to look back"
"22570750","22577910"," historically every time that's happened every bottom we've ever had see the fed fun rate fed fed"
"22577910","22585390"," cuts the rates employment sores inflation finally comes down boom you see the bottom you can see it"
"22585390","22593430"," going back except for the pre-1970s the fed used to use inflation to keep people employed so you"
"22593430","22599470"," had a high high employment during that time period unless we've changed modern monetary theory the"
"22599470","22605730"," same thing right here we can see this repetitively repetitively repetitively in history and you can"
"22605730","22611630"," see what happens when that when that yellow line comes over uh we end up uh bloodbath and it down"
"22611630","22618070"," below it so you use the weekly and the moving average here you use these three right here and you"
"22618070","22622210"," can just go through i would you did if you're a market participant you should be going through this"
"22622210","22630130"," all the way back to the 1930s probably back to the 1930s and you should see every period when you"
"22630130","22636490"," see a bottom you're like what happened at that bottom does it make sense you can actually see it"
"22636490","22645630"," right here in 2018 right we were able to go up right sideways and up and then we had the"
"22645630","22652230"," crash in 2020 as a matter of fact if you guys are new park market participants somewhere in here i"
"22652230","22657110"," remember that they were talking about a crash back here we were like i remember people saying we're"
"22657110","22663410"," going to crash soon right in here because it cut the rates unemployment started to soar well it"
"22663410","22670390"," didn't happen yet but there was a there was an idea that point was going to soar so i would"
"22670390","22675430"," uh you know like i would i would be if you if you're a market participant you should go back"
"22675430","22685280"," and just watch this shit so that you can see where you can see"
"22685280","22691000"," what everybody is talking about so you want to have a firm understanding of uh what people are"
"22691000","22695360"," talking about and then you can see who actually knows what the fuck they're talking about and who"
"22695360","22701360"," has no fucking idea what they're talking about like no fucking clue they're just pointing fingers"
"22701360","22712500"," everywhere it's pretty simple like that's your mac that's the only macro you need it's literally"
"22712500","22717900"," only the only macro you need there's some other things you can look at like if TLT starts to catch"
"22717900","22723680"," a bid and go sideways and up you should you should compare TLT to all those things too like throw"
"22723680","22728980"," that on your chart at some point and you actually see the sideways market and TLT rip you'll see"
"22728980","22737940"," HYG go down the divergence and HYG J and Kale the crap bonds so you can actually get like some"
"22737940","22747830"," good indicators about that stuff i think you need to"
"22747830","22751050"," know that it's not guaranteed i want you to go back on your own i want you to go back"
"22751050","22757290"," and i want you to fucking look because jpa is in the corner right now when you so when you"
"22757290","22762410"," heard me say jpa has to pass the cut rates he doesn't have a choice well he doesn't have a"
"22762410","22769070"," choice he's got a small window where he cannot we worry won't cut rates and stay the path where"
"22769070","22774930"," he's hoping he's hoping that by doing that the market's going to trade up in sideways in 2023"
"22774930","22781630"," that's his hope i promise you that's his soft landing that's it that's what he thinks he thinks if"
"22781630","22788490"," the market believes me he'll trade sideways enough the crash won't be that bad i can accept 32 or"
"22788490","22796250"," 3100 or 3000 but if the market doesn't believe him can we slip under in that 50 grabs us that's"
"22796250","22802620"," when you get your fucking full on hard landing so that's the big question coming into this"
"22802620","22812870"," confluence of the 50 and the 200 and the weekly so"
"22812870","22819010"," you should go back pause this video it's the end of the video right i'm going to close this video"
"22819010","22823710"," up from the next 10 minutes and you just go to the end of the video and look at everything"
"22823710","22828810"," i showed you there just plug it in for yourself and just go through every time would be like oh"
"22828810","22834810"," look the market actually went up sideways and up right before we had that last that last actual"
"22834810","22844310"," bottom and that happens every single cycle that shit goes only back to the 1930s like then this"
"22844310","22851490"," would be the first time it didn't happen so there you can even see like an entire year just imagine"
"22851490","22860970"," just imagine if during 2023 we melt it up for all of 2023 you melt it up and bears are"
"22860970","22870150"," pissed off and bulls are telling everyone this is the bottom so they're all on board and then boom"
"22870150","22876430"," slam right back down and then you get to real bottom so you should be i don't care if you're"
"22876430","22880530"," a bull or bear i think i think that i think that you should be looking at all that stuff"
"22880530","22885390"," right now like it's very important that you spend like a day or two chicken pears smoke a dooby"
"22885390","22895050"," drink cup of tea whatever you do and uh be so hyper aware of that stuff because all this nonsense"
"22895050","22899910"," here means nothing like all this stuff here just day in day out stuff doesn't really mean a whole"
"22899910","22907350"," lot it's like people on me on twitter shit posting or someone else shit posting doesn't mean"

"22914970","22923250"," few things they they use like very basic shit to uh decide what they're doing don't trust the fed"
"22923250","22930350"," the fed lies to you i promise you you can look back historically they sent some people from the"
"22930350","22938290"," stream to go over to uh was a euro euro dollar university they'll tell you the same thing no"
"22938290","22944670"," difference they'll tell you exactly what i'm telling you tell you don't don't they'll quote fed uh"

"22953020","22962270"," the fed does not control inflation the fed does not knock inflation down the fed basically is a"
"22962270","22972190"," tool to make the market do what it wants and hopefully uh fuck with main"
"22972190","22977150"," street to be honest with you they do that they do have that impact they can the only person that"
"22977150","22981410"," gets fucked or that gets a lot of people get messed up in this but that's a different conversation"
