"wNLurfJBQoE","98160","103640"," tomorrow leave this one up here"
"wNLurfJBQoE","103640","126000"," you"
"wNLurfJBQoE","126000","130720"," As we get into the three o'clock hour, I'll give you an update as to what I think happens into the rest of the week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","132160","134360"," I think we've discussed it a few times this morning."
"wNLurfJBQoE","135160","142960"," Now, we're going to harp on, I think at the three o'clock hour, we're going to harp on three specific things for this week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","145120","146680"," We're going to do look at a macro picture."
"wNLurfJBQoE","146800","155960"," We're going to look at, uh, upside macro stuff, and then we're going to look at, um, we're going to look at, hey, why can't bulls be"
"wNLurfJBQoE","156000","158160"," bullish here?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","159160","160520"," When can they get bullish?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","160520","162160"," We talked about that earlier this morning."
"wNLurfJBQoE","163400","168640"," Uh, and then we're going to also talk about, uh, what to expect later in the week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","169240","176160"," There's an argument here being made that I was listening to on news radio this morning in financial news radio."
"wNLurfJBQoE","176840","182880"," And the argument there, the, or the, or the, the drum beat being portrayed right now by this fed meeting."
"wNLurfJBQoE","183880","194240"," Uh, and, you know, they are kind of negative, but when we trade down into a, into one of these things, uh, I get weary of, of drinking that Kool-Aid."
"wNLurfJBQoE","194920","203120"," So if we were down, if we were hot, if we were at a high right now, if we were trading like 472 or something, we were rolling into that thing."
"wNLurfJBQoE","203120","204960"," I'd be like, ooh, bearish."
"wNLurfJBQoE","206880","208360"," I wouldn't be bullish on it at all."
"wNLurfJBQoE","209360","215560"," And even if we are bearish into it, like volatility kicks in, a hit market hedge comes out of the market."
"wNLurfJBQoE","217120","219360"," I'm not going to expect that much down."
"wNLurfJBQoE","219640","232240"," So if we even go down into this, um, Wyoming meeting of the mines, Montana, Utah, call all the escorts from the, in the West Denver."
"wNLurfJBQoE","233240","243240"," It'll get creepy with a bunch of creepy old men, creepy old, grossy, grossy, oily, oily, fingered, uh, old white guys that decide the fate of our economy."
"wNLurfJBQoE","246240","249240"," Uh, I still, still would expect at least to squeeze into it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","249240","252240"," So you squeeze up into that event."
"wNLurfJBQoE","253240","256240"," Uh, then we get some downside movement into the actual event."
"wNLurfJBQoE","257240","261240"," Uh, yeah, you tagged weekly trigger and then we're off and running to the upside."
"wNLurfJBQoE","261240","270240"," Now, saying all that though, heading back into the macro side of things, the looming question here is, um, where, what are they buying?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","270240","272240"," Like, are they actually buying the S&P 500?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","272240","273240"," Are they buying oil?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","274240","276240"," Are they attempting to buy TLT?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","277240","279240"," The TLT trade and its lows right now?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","279240","281240"," Um, so where does that money go?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","281240","282240"," Is it staying in the market?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","282240","285240"," Is like, think about it from this perspective."
"wNLurfJBQoE","285240","289240"," We only have, uh, where we have, we have major volatility expected."
"wNLurfJBQoE","289240","292240"," You know, like you think about where we are in the year."
"wNLurfJBQoE","293240","297240"," And if you think about where we are right now and you're like, hey, I want to start getting long in the marketplace."
"wNLurfJBQoE","298240","304240"," Uh, for the moves that we've made this year, how much, uh, how much you're going to make on that, that move higher."
"wNLurfJBQoE","304240","305240"," So."
"wNLurfJBQoE","306240","311240"," I was talking to a friend whose father wants to enter the market."
"wNLurfJBQoE","312240","315240"," This guy is very wealthy, like, is wealthy wealthy."
"wNLurfJBQoE","315240","319240"," He's got more than most of your, anyone you know one into it wealthy."
"wNLurfJBQoE","319240","322240"," He's got wants to deploy millions."
"wNLurfJBQoE","323240","326240"," And so our conversation is stemming around."
"wNLurfJBQoE","326240","328240"," Yeah, do you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","328240","331240"," Do you spend millions on a dip by here?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","332240","336240"," Even if we go higher for that volatility in the panic that'll set in."
"wNLurfJBQoE","337240","341240"," Do you just wait until February where it's like safer?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","341240","343240"," Like, is it just safer?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","344240","349240"," You know, it's like, it's like when we were in May, June, uh, when we were in October."
"wNLurfJBQoE","351240","354240"," You're like, yeah, how much more down can we go?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","354240","357240"," And even if we go down any farther, it's going to bounce quickly."
"wNLurfJBQoE","358240","359240"," So."
"wNLurfJBQoE","359240","363240"," Like that, putting that kind of risk on the market is a different question than where we are right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","363240","367240"," So even where we are right now in the marketplace, it's like, how do you buy this?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","367240","368240"," Yeah, maybe not."
"wNLurfJBQoE","369240","370240"," Does it mean we can't go up there?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","370240","374240"," No, we can go up there, but does it mean that it's worth that kind of money?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","375240","381240"," Uh, it's a hard thing to do because, uh, you like lots of panic sets in, you get crazy."
"wNLurfJBQoE","382240","383240"," You get kind of an eye."
"wNLurfJBQoE","383240","384240"," So."
"wNLurfJBQoE","386240","388240"," Uh, we'll talk about that at the three o'clock hour."
"wNLurfJBQoE","388240","389240"," It's a."
"wNLurfJBQoE","389240","390240"," Two twenty."
"wNLurfJBQoE","390240","391240"," Two twenty."
"wNLurfJBQoE","391240","392240"," Six right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","392240","397240"," Another half an hour left to the pot until power our sour steps in."
"wNLurfJBQoE","400240","402240"," Still have a small pack of zero dates on right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","403240","405240"," A little bit of roll right now coming up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","407240","408240"," Push that over so you can see it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","412240","413240"," A roll right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","413240","414240"," Don't like seeing this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","421240","426240"," No, they're trying to sell that down right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","426240","427240"," Is that what they're trying to do?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","431240","433240"," Trying to tell you that that's the top right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","434240","436240"," That's they're trying to tell you that's top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","438240","440240"," I'm going to try to roll you down right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","444240","445240"," All you need to do is get above it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","446240","447240"," Just get above it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","447240","449240"," Then you get the squeeze right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","451240","452240"," Just got to get above it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","452240","453240"," Just got to get above it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","453240","454240"," Just a little bit."
"wNLurfJBQoE","454240","455240"," Just right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","455240","456240"," There it is."
"wNLurfJBQoE","481240","482240"," I'll tell you right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","486240","488240"," Four thirty seven fifty."
"wNLurfJBQoE","492240","494240"," That's about where I am right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","496240","497240"," DCA right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","498240","500240"," If we give this up at any points right here,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","500240","502240"," I'm going to cut the calls loose and try to buy down here."

"wNLurfJBQoE","660240","662240"," Even if you get the reversal here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","662240","664240"," You need to break above."
"wNLurfJBQoE","664240","668240"," And you need the hourly trigger to come up and support you for the actual."
"wNLurfJBQoE","668240","669240"," The actual trip higher."
"wNLurfJBQoE","669240","670240"," That could be a week."

"wNLurfJBQoE","708240","710240"," And we're going to."
"wNLurfJBQoE","710240","713240"," Just we're going to scale out a little bit."

"wNLurfJBQoE","739240","742240"," Bull run is not over you want to know not yet it's not."
"wNLurfJBQoE","743240","746240"," And what's telling you that I'm going to show you what's telling you that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","746240","749240"," And the first thing that's telling you that is this yellow line."
"wNLurfJBQoE","750240","752240"," Did not follow price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","752240","753240"," Okay."
"wNLurfJBQoE","753240","755240"," Did not follow price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","756240","758240"," Oh, baby, we're squeezing."
"wNLurfJBQoE","759240","761240"," The yellow line did not fall."
"wNLurfJBQoE","761240","762240"," I'm serious."
"wNLurfJBQoE","762240","763240"," That's simple."
"wNLurfJBQoE","763240","765240"," Try to simplify things around here and I'm going to show it to you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","766240","772240"," Yellow line did not follow price down last week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","772240","773240"," See it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","773240","775240"," Start actually flatten out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","776240","779240"," So not seeing that end of the world."
"wNLurfJBQoE","779240","781240"," Not here yet for the bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","781240","782240"," Sorry."
"wNLurfJBQoE","782240","783240"," It's not here yet for the bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","784240","788240"," Now saying that I want you to see price when it's above."
"wNLurfJBQoE","788240","794240"," The yellow line and it confirms right one, two boomer off boomer off and running Yahoo."
"wNLurfJBQoE","794240","796240"," For buying dips, not selling rips, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","797240","798240"," Bull town, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","798240","799240"," Whoo."
"wNLurfJBQoE","799240","800240"," Everything's awesome."
"wNLurfJBQoE","800240","801240"," Now saying that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","801240","803240"," Hey, it's not over."
"wNLurfJBQoE","803240","808240"," Daily trigger is not following us down saying that still for bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","809240","812240"," Price needs to be above the yellow."
"wNLurfJBQoE","813240","815240"," Yellow needs to start working its way higher."
"wNLurfJBQoE","819240","820240"," Right."
"wNLurfJBQoE","820240","821240"," You want to be a confident bull."
"wNLurfJBQoE","821240","823240"," You want to see price get above this yellow line."
"wNLurfJBQoE","824240","827240"," You want to see price action just like this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","828240","829240"," You want to see green bars?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","829240","830240"," Well, yeah, everything's awesome."
"wNLurfJBQoE","831240","833240"," Come back down bounce around here, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","833240","834240"," Consolidate."
"wNLurfJBQoE","834240","836240"," You want to see the early trigger come up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","836240","840240"," Pick you up and start running you higher, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","840240","841240"," So you can take that trade."
"wNLurfJBQoE","841240","844240"," And even then you've got resistance above."
"wNLurfJBQoE","844240","847240"," It's going to come back down and try to slay you back down again."
"wNLurfJBQoE","847240","849240"," Pick you back up again and try to push higher."
"wNLurfJBQoE","850240","855240"," So you've got work to do like bulls have some relative safety above 445."
"wNLurfJBQoE","856240","859240"," And real safety above 450."
"wNLurfJBQoE","859240","862240"," It's like bulls like I said, it's the bears all the time, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","863240","864240"," You have to do this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","864240","865240"," You have to do that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","865240","866240"," You have to do this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","866240","867240"," You have to do that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","867240","868240"," Once you do that, it's all yours."
"wNLurfJBQoE","868240","869240"," You can take over."
"wNLurfJBQoE","869240","870240"," It's your time."
"wNLurfJBQoE","870240","871240"," You're selling it down."
"wNLurfJBQoE","871240","873240"," Bulls have nothing that they can do."
"wNLurfJBQoE","873240","876240"," So right now, bulls are not in control, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","876240","877240"," They have to get above the daily trigger."
"wNLurfJBQoE","877240","881240"," They have to get the hourly above the price above to go back into a regime"
"wNLurfJBQoE","881240","883240"," of going up and buying dips."
"wNLurfJBQoE","883240","884240"," Do you see that?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","884240","887240"," Now, I want you to pay attention to this yellow line here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","887240","888240"," There's a reason for it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","889240","892240"," I want to bring you back to previous examples."
"wNLurfJBQoE","893240","894240"," Okay."
"wNLurfJBQoE","894240","896240"," This is a current break that we just had."
"wNLurfJBQoE","897240","899240"," So we're kind of like right here, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","899240","900240"," Price is down here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","900240","902240"," We're a bloodbath in doom and gloom."
"wNLurfJBQoE","902240","906240"," Bears all, well, crazy telling you we're getting a market crash, all that kind of stuff."
"wNLurfJBQoE","906240","910240"," What you're not seeing in here is this yellow line is not falling price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","910240","912240"," Yellow line not falling price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","912240","914240"," Yellow line not falling price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","914240","915240"," Yellow line not falling price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","915240","916240"," Yellow line not falling price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","916240","917240"," Yellow line not falling price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","918240","919240"," Again and again and again."
"wNLurfJBQoE","919240","925240"," And only when you see the yellow line following price down."
"wNLurfJBQoE","926240","929240"," To the weekly trigger is at the top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","929240","931240"," That is the top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","931240","934240"," So are we at a top right now?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","934240","935240"," I'm going to tell you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","935240","937240"," Oh, we're not at a top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","939240","941240"," Do you think we're at a top?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","942240","944240"," No way, no how."
"wNLurfJBQoE","945240","949240"," What I want to see up here now, even though we're not at a top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","949240","951240"," What are bulls expecting here?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","951240","953240"," That's a whole nother conversation, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","953240","956240"," What are bulls expecting out of this?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","956240","962240"," Are they just expecting to get up here and trade this 445 and then continuation of the downside?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","962240","964240"," Does the yellow not follow?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","964240","965240"," And then it comes back up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","965240","969240"," You get to double bottom down here and eventually in October you go and hire."
"wNLurfJBQoE","969240","975240"," And even then we like what this break here, this break here in this daily trigger tells you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","975240","979240"," And maybe you're not getting 472 by end of quarter."
"wNLurfJBQoE","979240","982240"," Maybe you're not getting 480 by December, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","982240","985240"," So maybe you lower the expectations here for a bull."
"wNLurfJBQoE","985240","987240"," Can all that change?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","987240","988240"," Yeah."
"wNLurfJBQoE","988240","993240"," If you start to see a V shape recovery, we break above here before the end of the month."
"wNLurfJBQoE","993240","995240"," We start breaking up here into end of quarter."
"wNLurfJBQoE","995240","996240"," Yeah, I'm all with you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","996240","998240"," Take that trade right along with you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","999240","1000240"," Okay."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1001240","1005240"," So for right now is that was this the top?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1006240","1008240"," Very low chance that's the top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1008240","1010240"," 15% chance that's the top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1011240","1015240"," Will we likely come back up here and trade this before end of year?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1015240","1017240"," At least fail this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1017240","1020240"," At least fail 457."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1020240","1022240"," Absolutely."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1023240","1024240"," Absolutely."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1024240","1030240"," We're going to trade 457.50 again with like a 70 to 80% chance we're trading that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1030240","1031240"," Maybe not this week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1031240","1032240"," Maybe not next week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1033240","1038240"," Oh, trade 26 cents right now and calls for tomorrow."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1039240","1042240"," Grading 34 cents for calls for Wednesday."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1042240","1045240"," So is, are we in doom and gloom?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1045240","1047240"," Is like, is this a correction?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1047240","1048240"," Is it top?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1048240","1049240"," No, it's not the top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1049240","1050240"," Tell you right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1050240","1051240"," It's not the top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1051240","1052240"," Guaranteed."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1052240","1054240"," Like not getting like 70% chance."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1054240","1055240"," 80% chance."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1055240","1058240"," We have not seen the top in the market yet."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1058240","1060240"," Where is the top in the market?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1060240","1064240"," There is a high probability that it's somewhere right in here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1065240","1068240"," Some kind of failure at 455.87."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1068240","1074240"," Can we go higher than this and trade those other numbers that we have higher than 465."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1074240","1075240"," 470."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1075240","1076240"," 480."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1076240","1077240"," Yeah, we can."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1077240","1080240"," If we start squeezing and ripping faces off, we can get there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1080240","1083240"," But is it like, is it like guaranteed right now?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1083240","1085240"," Or hey, bulls are in charges right now?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1085240","1087240"," Oh, no, it is not."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1087240","1090240"," No, no way is it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1091240","1096240"," Made in 24 cents right now and calls for tomorrow for 443."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1096240","1098240"," Made in 32 cents."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1098240","1099240"," I should have taken that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1099240","1101240"," And I didn't take that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1101240","1107240"," So switching back over to a Webull full chart screen."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1107240","1111240"," Minimum expectations for bulls this week."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1111240","1114240"," Minimum expectations either Tuesday or Wednesday."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1114240","1116240"," I'm going to draw this out for you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1116240","1119240"," What the expectation is now we're going to talk about this too."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1119240","1123240"," Because last Monday, we sold after the belt."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1123240","1125240"," So right here, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1125240","1126240"," What do I want to see tomorrow?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1126240","1129240"," I want to see this 440 today or tomorrow."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1129240","1131240"," I want to see this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1131240","1136240"," I don't mind a pullback on Tuesday."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1136240","1138240"," But I do want to see this by Wednesday."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1138240","1140240"," It's 443, 445."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1140240","1141240"," Okay, somewhere in there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1141240","1142240"," That's my expectations."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1142240","1144240"," That's what I want to see."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1144240","1146240"," Saying that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1146240","1147240"," Saying that, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1147240","1150240"," This all means that we have to hold the hourly trigger."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1150240","1152240"," Like you have to hold it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1152240","1154240"," Can't like come into the clothes today."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1154240","1157240"," Squeeze up into this clothes, then begin to sell off,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1157240","1160240"," get underneath the hourly trigger and be bullish, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1160240","1163240"," You got to switch over and be bearish here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1163240","1165240"," If that happens."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1165240","1168240"," If you are looking for, if you're like, I missed all this cap."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1168240","1169240"," I didn't take any of this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1169240","1173240"," Earlier in this broadcast, people were like, go to the dark side."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1173240","1175240"," Take the puts down here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1175240","1176240"," I didn't do that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1176240","1178240"," I bought the dip, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1178240","1182240"," So I'm sure that there's a pain trade going on right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1182240","1185240"," I'm sure half the stream is pissed off right here where we are right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1185240","1188240"," So if you're looking, if you're like, hey, Cap, I missed all this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1188240","1190240"," I just want to, I just want to buy and cap."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1190240","1192240"," You are looking down here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1192240","1195240"," Right where this DCA Wednesday calls a pullback right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1195240","1196240"," You want to buy in this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1196240","1199240"," So currently that sits at 437.48."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1199240","1202240"," If you have a chance to buy that, buy that dip."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1202240","1205240"," The worst-paced scenario, you're buying this, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1205240","1208240"," It starts to bounce and you can take that higher."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1208240","1209240"," There's your entry."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1209240","1211240"," It begins to roll lower."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1211240","1216240"," You cut yourself out of that trade and you start to sell the market or buy puts."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1216240","1220240"," Now, can they get all doom and gloomy into this clothes like they did last Monday?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1220240","1221240"," You're right."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1221240","1222240"," They can."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1222240","1227240"," So if we get up into this price target, into the clothes today, let's say we trade this"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1227240","1235240"," for $39.93 for $39.93 and we take the money off the table here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1235240","1240240"," Trading $439.49 right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1240240","1246240"," If we trade this right here, right, and you've been bullish and you've been riding this up,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1246240","1251240"," you'll like take the money right here and look for a dip buy down in here at some point"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1251240","1256240"," after the bell or what have you or the open if they get nasty and sell this down."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1256240","1262240"," So you're going to be sitting on the sidelines until we either hit this target right here"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1262240","1271240"," for a dip buy or we roll down, roll down into right here, this DCA zone right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1271240","1274240"," But right now, still heading higher."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1274240","1278240"," Still sitting on that six EMA."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1278240","1283240"," Griding higher, climbing the wall of worry."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1283240","1286240"," Still have this here is a tag in the day."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1286240","1289240"," We'll see if we can grab this little bit right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1289240","1292240"," Now 10 minutes past."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1292240","1298240"," If you're looking to sell, if you're a bear, so if you're a seller, you are trying to sell."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1298240","1302240"," I'm going to give you a couple places to sell."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1302240","1309240"," First target for you to sell is 444 even."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1309240","1317240"," And your next target to sell if it begins to roll is 438."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1317240","1321240"," Let's call it 438."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1321240","1329240"," So if you can get underneath 438, start selling again with some stops on the upside of that number."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1329240","1331240"," So there's kind of no man's land here for sellers."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1331240","1333240"," Sellers want to be selling."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1333240","1335240"," Well, it's actually 437."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1336240","1343240"," I prefer to sell it to sell like 437 and change somewhere below this down here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1343240","1345240"," Somewhere below this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1345240","1347240"," Start selling."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1347240","1352240"," If we start trading like this right here, we start blasting down here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1352240","1354240"," We'll just change it out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1354240","1362240"," If we started blasting down, you'd want to sell any kind of like a breather up here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1362240","1363240"," Like that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1363240","1364240"," Bullshit in there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1364240","1366240"," And then you'd enter right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1366240","1372240"," And that's where that's where your leg is to the to 428."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1372240","1374240"," That's right."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1374240","1377240"," That's your cell leg right there to 428 right down there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1377240","1379240"," Otherwise."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1379240","1383240"," Otherwise."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1383240","1387240"," I am looking for this trade right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1387240","1390240"," And then I'm looking for this bounce."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1390240","1395240"," And the continuation of 443, 445."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1395240","1398240"," Now, if you're if you're a bull, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1398240","1403240"," If you're if you're a bull watching this program or if you're a bear watching this program right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1403240","1404240"," I'm not on."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1404240","1406240"," We'll look at SPX really quick."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1406240","1412240"," We're talking about SPX on more macro side of things."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1412240","1416240"," Trading 25 right now and 32."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1416240","1418240"," Trying to trade this target up here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1418240","1426240"," If I can take the money on both of those trades, I will."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1426240","1431240"," We're going to talk about the fundamental thesis of bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1431240","1436240"," And the hopes of bears and sellers."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1436240","1440240"," Now, we did a program on the 23rd, I think."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1440240","1443240"," Let me go back and look and see when that program was."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1443240","1445240"," They can show it to you guys."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1445240","1446240"," Come on here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1446240","1451240"," Just a second."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1451240","1460240"," Let's go over here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1460240","1466240"," Where is it?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1466240","1467240"," Where am I?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1467240","1468240"," Where am I?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1468240","1472240"," The videos are all videos are not in the right place."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1472240","1477240"," Yeah, so this one here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1477240","1479240"," I only had a thousand views."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1479240","1484240"," That's hilarious."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1484240","1491240"," A little second here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1491240","1495240"," That's even that's even crazier."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1495240","1500240"," Okay, so what am I doing here?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1500240","1504240"," I'm going to bring this down for you guys."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1504240","1506240"," Oh, yeah, look at that hourly trigger turning around right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1506240","1511240"," Look at that hourly trigger turning around."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1511240","1514240"," So I'm going to post in the chats."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1514240","1516240"," I should have put that in the live chat."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1516240","1520240"," I'm going to post a link to this video."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1520240","1525240"," So this is a video that I posted on I believe three weeks ago in the 23rd."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1525240","1526240"," Watch this later."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1526240","1531240"," I only got a thousand views of private stream for the discord."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1531240","1534240"," Made the stream late night for discorders."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1534240","1539240"," It's public now, but there's the stream."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1539240","1544240"," Trading 26 right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1544240","1547240"," Trading 26 right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1547240","1552240"," Trading 34 right now in the squeeze higher trading 439 59."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1552240","1555240"," Squeeze and hire just climbing the wall of war."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1555240","1557240"," I posted this to you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1557240","1560240"," Post this to you on."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1560240","1565240"," So just watch this video and where the market was when I played this video."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1565240","1571240"," It's important for you to see that video because we were talking about."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1571240","1573240"," We're at it like a local top."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1573240","1574240"," Does it trick?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1574240","1576240"," Does it come back down into the daily trigger?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1576240","1580240"," Or is it roll into a correction and you wake up one day?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1580240","1585240"," The idea by this video is don't be surprised if you wake up this week or next week and"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1585240","1587240"," we are correcting the market."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1587240","1591240"," And also as we corrected this market."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1591240","1594240"," Come on, just pay me."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1594240","1599240"," I don't want 26 cents."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1599240","1600240"," I don't want 34."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1600240","1603240"," I was at the 36 a minute ago in 445."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1603240","1613240"," Straight this number up here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1613240","1617240"," So the idea behind this video is the idea behind where we are."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1617240","1619240"," Stends into SPX."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1619240","1623240"," So we're going to look at SPX here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1623240","1625240"," We're going to go back to a Webull full chart."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1625240","1628240"," We're going to go back to SPX and review that same chart."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1628240","1634240"," Give me SPX."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1634240","1637240"," So SPX in this daily chart here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1637240","1638240"," We went over this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1638240","1643240"," We've gone over this now two or three times and you've got a quarter right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1643240","1648240"," Right in 26 right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1648240","1652240"," You've got a quarter right here, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1652240","1655240"," Sorry."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1655240","1661240"," You've got a quarter right here and you've got the dip that got bought right there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1661240","1662240"," Right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1662240","1664240"," This did not happen here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1664240","1666240"," Did it?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1666240","1669240"," We corrected down farther."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1669240","1670240"," Right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1670240","1674240"," Now if that dip had been bought, you would expect at the end of this quarter to tag those upper"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1674240","1678240"," targets on SPX and on the collar."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1678240","1684240"," Now with this major pullback here, the cluster becomes, well, can we get to the collar at"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1684240","1686240"," 46.65 still?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1686240","1687240"," Is it feasible?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1687240","1688240"," It is."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1688240","1690240"," It's feasible."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1690240","1697240"," It's feasible to get there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1697240","1702240"," It's feasible to fail this all time high back here too."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1702240","1704240"," And then this is December right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1704240","1708240"," Can you actually get the all time high into December?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1708240","1712240"," Right in 27 cents right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1712240","1717240"," But the key point here is if you're a bull, if you're a bull, if you're a bear listening"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1717240","1725240"," to me right now, if you're a seller listening to me right now, the bull thesis relies upon"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1725240","1726240"," this happening."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1726240","1733240"," They don't care about this failure here, but relies upon the end of the year, the 31st,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1733240","1735240"," the beginning that all time high."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1735240","1739240"," Now I'm going to direct your attention back to what makes this important."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1739240","1741240"," And that's this stuff over here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1741240","1742240"," Right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1742240","1744240"," It's okay to fail this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1744240","1749240"," It's okay for Mike Barry to come up over here and say market crash, market correction."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1749240","1750240"," We know these guys are coming out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1750240","1752240"," We know they're going to come out here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1752240","1759240"," We already know that the Mike Barry, we've had a video, a previous video that said Mike"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1759240","1760240"," is going to come out here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1760240","1761240"," He's going to come out right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1761240","1762240"," And he's going to come out right here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1762240","1768240"," Every time we come to this point, this point in that point, you're going to see Barry's"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1768240","1770240"," and people like him come out of the woodwork."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1770240","1775240"," We saw Barry come out the next day, I think a day or two later, right here and say boom."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1775240","1778240"," Yeah, we're going to have a correction."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1778240","1779240"," Right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1779240","1780240"," Maybe the end of the market."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1780240","1782240"," This is the top, any of that kind of stuff."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1782240","1786240"," So bulls for your thesis to play out, you need to come up here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1786240","1788240"," You're fine to fill that in the middle of the fall."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1788240","1793240"," You're actually fine to get up here into the beginning of the year."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1793240","1795240"," This would keep your thesis alive."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1795240","1803240"," If you begin to have failures up here, if you're a buyer and you see bullshit like that, you're"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1803240","1807240"," going to see it deeper low once we get into the fall."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1807240","1813240"," And you can kiss off any kind of like all time highs in the December 31st at that point."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1814240","1818240"," And the bare thesis starts to gain some traction."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1818240","1821240"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1821240","1823240"," I might take, I might get out of here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1823240","1828240"," I might just close here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1828240","1830240"," I'm not paying attention."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1830240","1836240"," So the idea being here is if you start saying you can't be a bull and say, oh, we didn't"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1836240","1839240"," get the failure before all time highs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1839240","1841240"," Oh, we didn't get the all time highs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1841240","1843240"," Oh, and we're going to go way up here in 2024."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1843240","1844240"," Does it make sense?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1844240","1846240"," None of that plays out for you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1846240","1851240"," If you start failing in here, you start doing this bull and bulls get weak."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1851240","1854240"," You know, you can kiss off 4,000 and 3,800."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1854240","1857240"," Now you're looking at 3,500, 3,600."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1857240","1860240"," You're looking at much steeper lows here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1860240","1862240"," And you can kiss all this out way too."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1862240","1863240"," All that's gone."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1863240","1864240"," Garbage."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1864240","1870240"," All that stuff becomes garbage down the road if you fail to give the reason why bulls think"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1870240","1873240"," we're going higher down the road."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1873240","1876240"," So as we come up here, you're going to expect craziness."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1876240","1877240"," Absolutely."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1877240","1880240"," You're going to expect volatilities we got there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1880240","1881240"," Absolutely."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1881240","1882240"," We did a whole video on this."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1882240","1883240"," We did a whole video on."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1883240","1885240"," You're going to expect volatility."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1885240","1887240"," You're going to expect violent moves to the upside."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1887240","1890240"," To get there, they're not going to give it to you free and easy."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1890240","1893240"," They're not going to say to you, oh, cap, don't worry about it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1893240","1894240"," We're just going to go straight up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1894240","1897240"," That's like a bear saying that we're going straight down, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1897240","1899240"," That's not going to happen."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1900240","1903240"," Trading $4.39.62."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1903240","1910240"," Do I get my $4.99.93 here into this close?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1910240","1916240"," So bulls is your thesis broken?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","1916240","1918240"," No."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1918240","1920240"," Bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1920240","1923240"," Dude, like you don't have a choice."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1923240","1926240"," Like you literally don't have a choice here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1927240","1929240"," You're not going to go into."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1929240","1932240"," You're not going to go into."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1932240","1936240"," Don't think that you're going into the end of Q3."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1936240","1938240"," And not getting 4.72."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1938240","1941240"," Just don't even think it, but you have to."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1941240","1945240"," If you don't get that 4.72, you don't get the 4.65."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1945240","1946240"," 4.72."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1946240","1951240"," You're not up there going, Hey, my look at me top of the world on Q3."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1951240","1953240"," What do you think happens with the."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1954240","1957240"," They're not going for Q4."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1957240","1959240"," They're not going for 80."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1959240","1960240"," They're not going to."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1960240","1962240"," They're going to come out with a collar on."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1962240","1965240"," The end of quarter and be like, yeah, 484 90."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1965240","1968240"," They're not going to do that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1968240","1970240"," And you're not going to get what you want."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1970240","1973240"," Even if we get a major pullback in the fall, you're not going to get."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1973240","1976240"," That 48 JPM car and they're going to come out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1976240","1978240"," These sellers will come out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1979240","1982240"," On the 31st and they're going to 29th, I think, for September."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1982240","1984240"," And they're going to come out and tell you look at."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1984240","1987240"," Look at this JPM just told you your upside is limited."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1987240","1990240"," You don't want that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1990240","1994240"," Do not want that heading into Q4."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1994240","1998240"," Now you can have a big, big nasty, like downside target."
"wNLurfJBQoE","1998240","2001240"," And Q4, as long as you got that 480 up there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2001240","2005240"," It'll still be a magnet for you to trade up into."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2006240","2010240"," And this impacts the thesis for bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2010240","2013240"," Into 2024."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2013240","2018240"," It impacts the thesis for the downside targets."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2018240","2021240"," You know, I'm going to assure you, but I warn you of something."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2021240","2025240"," If you're a bull moment, we know that we're pausing a moment."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2025240","2027240"," We know we're going to get some."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2027240","2029240"," Some."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2029240","2031240"," Some rate cuts down the road."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2031240","2034240"," They're going to front run it by months to three months out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2035240","2039240"," And you really want to know like when they when they front run that road,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2039240","2043240"," that role in the marketplace, you're going to need to know."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2043240","2046240"," The depth of destruction that's coming from that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2046240","2050240"," And the length of the depth of destruction that's coming from that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2050240","2056240"," And you don't want to be going into that role in saying, Oh, we failed to get all time highs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2056240","2058240"," You want to say we got all time highs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2058240","2059240"," I don't care where we go down here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2059240","2062240"," It's only going to be a bounce for us to rock it up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2063240","2066240"," Examples historically of us not making all time highs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2066240","2068240"," Don't end well."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2068240","2070240"," Like they do not end well."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2070240","2071240"," There's not many of them."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2071240","2073240"," There's only a few of them."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2073240","2076240"," But there are, but those few that we have are no bueno."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2076240","2078240"," They're just not good."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2078240","2080240"," We don't need to hold all time highs either."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2080240","2082240"," We just need to go up there and tag it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2082240","2083240"," You go up there and tag it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2083240","2086240"," Then we pull back down and then we're often running again."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2086240","2088240"," So you don't want to see that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2088240","2089240"," Nobody wants to see that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2090240","2095240"," Like if a seller sees that we don't make all time highs in my brain as a buyer."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2095240","2097240"," I already know that if I don't see that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2097240","2100240"," That I will sell everything like just start selling."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2100240","2102240"," Put a nice fat."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2102240","2107240"," A nice fat."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2107240","2112240"," Train against the market for a year out from now and just wait for that low because I know that it's coming, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2112240","2115240"," A nice big fat put back spread in the marketplace."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2116240","2121240"," Run for December of 2024 and it's likely going lower than 38."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2121240","2126240"," It's likely going to 36 or 33 or 32, 35 somewhere nasty."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2126240","2130240"," You know, so there's not much time left for bulls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2130240","2136240"," And that raises that part of the conversation of just looking at that SPX chart right there, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2136240","2143240"," Raises the question of is it worth putting that risk on into end of year?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2143240","2144240"," Is it?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2144240","2146240"," Is it okay to put it on?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2146240","2147240"," Yeah, it's okay."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2147240","2149240"," Is it okay to put everything into it?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2149240","2152240"," But as of right now, it isn't."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2152240","2154240"," You got to get above the daily trigger."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2154240","2157240"," You got to get above the price early than daily."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2157240","2159240"," And you got to do it fast."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2159240","2162240"," You don't have a lot of time on your hands to do it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2162240","2164240"," And sellers want nothing more."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2164240","2169240"," Anyone with a thesis to the downside or a crash or not a correction."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2170240","2171240"," Anything."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2171240","2172240"," It's like more than a correction."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2172240","2174240"," Anyone with that, like, we're going to 4000."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2174240","2180240"," We're going to roll this over and do the Mike Barry fraud trade failure to get above and then roll it back down."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2180240","2183240"," And see destructive destruction in the marketplace."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2183240","2185240"," Those people are looking for that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2185240","2188240"," They don't want to see us trade back up to the previous side."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2188240","2190240"," They don't want to see you trade 465."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2190240","2192240"," They don't want to see you trade 472."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2192240","2198240"," They're not going to come back up to you afterwards and say we're going to 2,800, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2198240","2201240"," If you see that stuff, likely not going to happen."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2201240","2215240"," If you see those prices to the upside, you're likely going to see whatever pullback happens is not going to be as destructive as that 3234, 3600."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2215240","2220240"," You're going to see likely 4,200, 4000, maybe 3,800 at best."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2220240","2224240"," So this is kind of important for you in the bull thesis."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2224240","2226240"," Sellers know this already."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2226240","2229240"," I'm hoping I'm assuming that most of them do that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2229240","2230240"," They don't want to see us go."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2230240","2236240"," They don't want to see us retest, not even retest, but get a new high on the previous side that we had."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2236240","2238240"," They don't want to see the 465."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2238240","2240240"," They don't want to see the 472 guaranteed."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2240240","2246240"," They don't want to see those things hundred percent."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2246240","2249240"," I'm telling you right now, the end of this quarter."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2249240","2252240"," I'm warning you if you're a bull."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2253240","2255240"," The end of this quarter matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2255240","2257240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2257240","2258240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2258240","2260240"," It impacts like your end of year."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2260240","2264240"," It impacts your down late winter price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2264240","2271240"," It impacts your thesis for 2024, 2025."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2274240","2276240"," It impacts everything."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2276240","2277240"," It's a pretty big deal."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2277240","2279240"," It's not a big deal."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2279240","2280240"," We broke daily."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2280240","2282240"," We haven't broken weekly yet."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2282240","2286240"," Daily did not come down with price, which is good to see."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2286240","2288240"," But you don't have time."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2288240","2290240"," You're a bullman."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2290240","2291240"," Yeah, it's okay."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2291240","2293240"," Is it okay to put everything into it?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2293240","2294240"," Fuck no."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2294240","2296240"," As of right now, it isn't."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2296240","2298240"," You got to get above the daily trigger."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2298240","2302240"," You got to get above the price, hourly, then daily."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2302240","2303240"," And you got to do it fast."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2303240","2306240"," You don't have a lot of time on your hands to do it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2307240","2309240"," And sellers want nothing more."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2309240","2314240"," Anyone with a thesis to the downside or a crash or not a correction, anything."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2314240","2315240"," It's like more than a correction."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2315240","2317240"," Anyone with that, like, they were going to 4,000."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2317240","2323240"," We're going to roll this over and do the Mike Barry fraud trade failure to get above and then roll it back down."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2323240","2326240"," And see destructive destruction in the marketplace."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2326240","2328240"," Those people are looking for that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2328240","2331240"," They don't want to see us trade back up to the previous side."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2331240","2333240"," They don't want to see you trade 465."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2334240","2336240"," They don't want to see you trade 472."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2336240","2342240"," They're not going to come back up to you afterwards and say we're going to 2,800, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2342240","2345240"," If you see that stuff, likely not going to happen."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2345240","2359240"," If you see those prices to the upside, you're likely going to see whatever pullback happens is not going to be as destructive as that 32, 34, 3600."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2359240","2364240"," You're going to see likely 4,200, 4,000, maybe 3800 at best."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2364240","2368240"," So this is kind of important for you in the bull thesis."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2368240","2370240"," Sellers know this already."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2370240","2374240"," I'm hoping I'm assuming that most of them do that they don't want to see us go."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2374240","2376240"," They don't want to see us retest."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2376240","2380240"," Not even retest, but get a new high on the previous side that we had."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2380240","2382240"," You don't want to see the 465."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2382240","2384240"," They don't want to see the 472 guaranteed."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2384240","2385240"," They don't want to see those things."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2385240","2387240"," 100 fucking percent."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2387240","2392240"," I'm telling you right now, the end of this quarter."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2392240","2395240"," I'm fucking warning you if you're a bull."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2395240","2397240"," The end of this quarter matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2397240","2399240"," It fucking matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2399240","2400240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2400240","2401240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2401240","2402240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2402240","2404240"," It impacts like your end of year."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2404240","2408240"," It impacts your, your down late winter price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2408240","2413240"," It impacts your thesis for 2024."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2413240","2416240"," 2025."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2417240","2420240"," It impacts everything."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2420240","2421240"," It's a pretty big deal."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2421240","2423240"," It's not a, it's a big deal."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2423240","2424240"," We broke daily."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2424240","2426240"," We haven't broken weekly yet."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2426240","2430240"," Daily did not come down with price, which is good to see."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2430240","2432240"," But you don't have time."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2432240","2434240"," You're a fucking bull man."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2434240","2438240"," You're kind of like the guy that I don't know."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2438240","2440240"," You're left footed."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2440240","2444240"," You're just not, you're not following through right now as you should."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2445240","2447240"," I have high expectations, by the way."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2447240","2449240"," I'm not a low expectation person."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2449240","2453240"," So I'm like every pullback better get bought."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2453240","2456240"," So, but that is a big thing, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2456240","2459240"," You're, if you're a, if you're a buyer, seller's market,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2459240","2461240"," you're looking for these things."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2461240","2464240"," You're looking for these things into the end of this quarter."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2464240","2466240"," You're looking for these things into."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2466240","2469240"," Setting up the rest of the year."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2470240","2472240"," You know, where are we headed?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2472240","2474240"," Where's the grand thesis here?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2474240","2476240"," And it wasn't a good look."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2476240","2479240"," Well, it wasn't a good look for bulls to give that much up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2479240","2482240"," It wasn't, it's not a good look looking at."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2482240","2486240"," Dad tends to choose them like, man, not so much."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2486240","2489240"," It's not like your time is burning, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2489240","2493240"," But by the time they do pause rates or bring them down or cut rates,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2493240","2495240"," like your time is burning, right?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2495240","2498240"," But by the time they do pause rates or bring them down or cut rates,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2498240","2499240"," like your time is burning."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2499240","2504240"," You don't have that time as a buyer and you need reasons for the market to go up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2504240","2508240"," Like you need a reason for that market to go up there."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2508240","2512240"," Some belief that, that we're near the end."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2512240","2516240"," And I don't know if that happens in this meeting this week,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2516240","2518240"," that, that, that gets reinstilled."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2518240","2527240"," I don't know that, that Jerome wants this market lower than back to 3500."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2527240","2531240"," He probably knows that he's setting that up right now too."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2531240","2535240"," Like does he know that, like you want to bring the market,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2535240","2541240"," like you want to trade the market sideways and down in sideways and sideways and up"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2541240","2542240"," as long as you can."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2542240","2548240"," His ultimate plan is for that to happen to trade this market sideways for longer."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2548240","2554240"," It's the greatest gift given to our market is to trade it sideways for multiple years,"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2554240","2556240"," two, three years."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2556240","2561240"," I'm telling you right now, the end of this quarter, I'm fucking warning you if you're a bull."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2561240","2563240"," The end of this quarter matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2563240","2564240"," It fucking matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2564240","2565240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2565240","2566240"," It matters."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2566240","2568240"," It impacts like your end of year."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2568240","2571240"," It impacts your, your down late winter price."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2571240","2577240"," It impacts your thesis for 2024, 2025."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2579240","2580240"," It impacts everything."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2580240","2581240"," It's a pretty big deal."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2581240","2582240"," Like it's not, it's a big deal."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2582240","2583240"," We broke daily."

"wNLurfJBQoE","2604240","2607240"," So I'm like every pullback better get bought."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2607240","2610240"," So that is a big thing, right?"

"wNLurfJBQoE","2639240","2643240"," But by the time they do pause rates or bring them down or cut rates, like your time is burning."

"wNLurfJBQoE","2682240","2688240"," It's the greatest gift given to our market is to trade it sideways for multiple years, two, three years."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2689240","2692240"," It, it, it limits the downside damage."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2692240","2699240"," Even though it's a stagnant market, it, it reduces volatility in the marketplace on a grander scale."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2699240","2701240"," That big rubber band effect that we end up having."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2701240","2706240"," So does he want to talk it down? Yes. Does he, is this close enough in horse using hand grenades?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2706240","2707240"," Probably."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2707240","2716240"," But he knows he's going to have to come out either in this meeting on Thursday, Friday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and talk it down right where we are to get it down to that 3500."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2717240","2722240"," Or he knows that if we get up to the 4700, he's going to have to slam it down into that 3800."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2722240","2727240"," Inside of those two question marks is, well, if we trade it, let's we crash it right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2727240","2732240"," Does it open up the door to a major market crash? They don't want that either."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2732240","2740240"," And I know you think that they want that, but they likely do not want to see us trade below 35 and then start looking for 1600."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2740240","2742240"," I don't think that's the intent at least."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2743240","2750240"," So it's, I think it's a very like complicated thing for them to do. I think it's, I don't think it's easy here to do it and be able to pull the market back up."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2750240","2753240"," I think it's easier to sell a major sell at 472."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2753240","2763240"," He had even 4,800, 472, 4,800 somewhere in there to do a major sell to the downside and have that bottom be higher than the 3450."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2763240","2769240"," That previous low, I think they want that bounce in that 3500 3600 to continue to trade sideways."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2770240","2773240"," Now we are pretty close, right? In the last week, we're pretty close."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2773240","2777240"," I mean, what's 170 points? Not a whole lot. What's the risk though?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2777240","2783240"," If we trade below that 3500 is when you start to bring in these major lows, like 26, 16 again, 14 again."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2784240","2788240"," Mass paranoia, all that kind of stuff. And you need catalysts for that too."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2788240","2791240"," What are those catalysts to make that happen?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","2792240","2795240"," You can't, you're not just going to trade it without catalysts, right? So it's like Jerome's going to look down the road."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2795240","2802240"," But like, well, if we start trading down there, what catalysts are there to send us to start crashing this market even harder and heavier."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2803240","2809240"," Trading $0.23 right now, getting a little bit of a roll in this close still long for calls for tomorrow and Wednesday."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2809240","2813240"," Want to see that $4.39.93 get traded if we can trade it to this bell."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2813240","2818240"," If we do trade this right now, I'm going to end up taking those calls off the table and be flat into tomorrow."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2819240","2821240"," We'll see how this works itself out."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2821240","2824240"," Now 32 past the hour coming into the close."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2829240","2835240"," Yeah, the importance is very important. So you're talking like major fundamental changes."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2836240","2841240"," Major fundamental changes in the expectations of where the market goes."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2852240","2854240"," Yeah, put back spread."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2854240","2860240"," You got a failure of 472, 480. It's like a giant fucking put back spread for the whole year of 2024."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2867240","2869240"," Like a lot of your ex boyfriends."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2870240","2872240"," I'm reading the, I'm not seeing the entire chat here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2872240","2876240"," For some reason, I'm only seeing the Twitch chat. I don't know why that is. I'm going to refresh the chat."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2876240","2878240"," I'm not seeing the YouTube chat at all, like zero."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2879240","2881240"," So I'm on YouTube right now going to see what those guys are saying."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2882240","2886240"," I missed the entire YouTube chat today. I'm only reading. I don't know why I'm only reading Twitch."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2886240","2891240"," Maybe I'm signed in on the wrong. I think I have to switch my sign in so that I can see both chats."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2892240","2896240"," Trade 26 and 34 right now and 443 is in 445."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2898240","2900240"," Give me a big ass fucking payday today."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2901240","2904240"," Yeah, I was going to do some some more some more earnings plays for the close to today."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2905240","2906240"," Hold on a second."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2907240","2912240"," I was going to do some some more some more earnings plays for the close to today."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2913240","2914240"," Hold on a second here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2914240","2915240"," Hold on a second here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2929240","2930240"," Eli Lilly just keeps on trucking."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2931240","2935240"," Thanks for following the black."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2935240","2938240"," And still pulling Stoller."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2938240","2939240"," Stoller."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2939240","2940240"," I don't know."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2940240","2942240"," Trade 43977 right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2943240","2945240"," They gave me a fucking penny."
"wNLurfJBQoE","2946240","2948240"," They gave me a penny on my calls for tomorrow."

"wNLurfJBQoE","3637240","3639240"," So I trade futures right now and tasty."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3639240","3641240"," And I was going to leave some money on tasty."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3641240","3644240"," To trade futures with you guys for like three days, five days."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3644240","3645240"," Something like that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3645240","3646240"," Okay."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3646240","3649240"," So yeah, you guys can do it on find a find a."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3649240","3653240"," Find a platform throw like a five grand or something on a."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3653240","3654240"," On a platform."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3654240","3657240"," I think you can trade the micros with like three to five grand."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3657240","3658240"," Something like that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3658240","3659240"," You should be good."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3660240","3662240"," So they're offering 24 hour trading on certain stocks now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3662240","3663240"," I think so."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3663240","3664240"," Yeah."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3664240","3666240"," So Casey is saying something that I think is true."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3666240","3669240"," I think they're allowing you to trade like options against."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3669240","3672240"," Futures contracts on like an unlike a specific ETN."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3672240","3675240"," Like an or an ETN ETF that like mimics."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3675240","3676240"," Tell him wrong on that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3676240","3678240"," Like options on futures or something."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3678240","3680240"," I don't know exactly what the fuck it is."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3681240","3682240"," Yeah, my methodology is a lot different."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3682240","3683240"," All I need to know is no."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3683240","3687240"," So the reason why futures traders watch this show is not because"
"wNLurfJBQoE","3687240","3688240"," of the ups and downs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3688240","3689240"," They know the direction is pretty much right."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3689240","3691240"," So it's way futures is easier."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3691240","3693240"," Easier trading."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3693240","3695240"," All this caveats to that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3695240","3697240"," If it goes against, you don't have stops."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3697240","3698240"," You don't get a fill."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3698240","3699240"," You can."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3699240","3700240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3700240","3701240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3701240","3702240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3702240","3703240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3703240","3704240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3704240","3705240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3705240","3706240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3706240","3707240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3707240","3708240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3708240","3709240"," You'll be watching."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3709240","3711240"," You'll be walking up and down the street for a week or two."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3711240","3712240"," Panicking."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3712240","3714240"," There's more risk in futures."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3714240","3716240"," Well, I have a whole thing."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3716240","3717240"," I wrote it all down for you."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3717240","3720240"," So there's like a whole thing behind like."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3720240","3721240"," Carry costs."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3721240","3723240"," There's problems with like whoever."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3723240","3724240"," Let's say you're buying dips."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3724240","3725240"," We don't go back up again."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3725240","3727240"," You get caught upside down in a trade."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3727240","3728240"," It can be devastating."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3734240","3736240"," Yeah, I've trained futures, but I don't normally talk about it in"
"wNLurfJBQoE","3736240","3737240"," stream."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3737240","3738240"," But I'm moving."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3738240","3742960"," So the reason I'm saying the reason I'm willing to do this is because I'm moving my options"
"wNLurfJBQoE","3742960","3748440"," trading to a prime bank and I'm I still have some money in a future in a margin account"
"wNLurfJBQoE","3748440","3757240"," with Casey trade and I'm like, eh, I'm like, do I move that to or do I?"
"wNLurfJBQoE","3757240","3759240"," I've never had a problem with fills on tasty with futures."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3759240","3764240"," So I'm like, maybe I leave that there and I trade that like I do a series on it or something."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3765240","3766240"," I think for the micro."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3766240","3768240"," I think three to five grand will be enough."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3768240","3770240"," Somewhere in there, three to five thousand to trade micros."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3770240","3776240"," Maybe someone else could chime in and say that's not enough or I'm usually trying to scalp"
"wNLurfJBQoE","3776240","3777240"," futures mostly."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3781240","3783240"," Three to five three to five thousand dollars."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3783240","3784240"," I think you'd be fine trading."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3784240","3786240"," Yes, we could trade in Q two."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3786240","3788240"," I'm not opposed to trading either."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3788240","3790240"," So we'll talk about that in a coming week or so."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3791240","3795240"," I'm actually trying to move some money into a futures account on tasty right now to it."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3795240","3796240"," It's not going well."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3799240","3802240"," So I'll see you guys on tomorrow at nine thirty in the morning."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3802240","3803240"," I'm still sitting these calls."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3803240","3805240"," I'm like, eh, get five minutes left."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3805240","3806240"," Decide if I hold them."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3806240","3808240"," I do this shit all the time."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3808240","3809240"," I'm like, eh, like it's four fifteen."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3809240","3812240"," I'm going to cut them, cut them loose and just started getting tomorrow."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3816240","3817240"," That's what I think."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3817240","3822240"," I think three to five thousand is enough for the micro."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3822240","3824240"," There's a U six right now or something like that."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3827240","3829240"," So that's actually not a bad sign calls we can value."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3836240","3837240"," I'm going to throw some more on right now."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3837240","3838240"," Hold on."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3844240","3845240"," I'm going to buy some more here."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3848240","3849240"," Thanks for saying something."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3849240","3850240"," So we'll see."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3850240","3851240"," All right."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3851240","3853240"," I'll see you guys tomorrow at nine thirty in the morning."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3853240","3857240"," Keep that in mind that future stuff you guys want to open a margin account somewhere."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3857240","3861240"," If you don't already trade futures, we'll trade some futures together."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3861240","3864240"," The easy, the nice part about futures is it's going that way."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3864240","3866240"," You don't care about those bumps along the way."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3866240","3871240"," Just like long with some stops, raise stops, and we'll get out of a roll of turns, turns, turns on us."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3871240","3873240"," So I'll see all of you guys tomorrow."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3873240","3874240"," Definitely not the same."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3874240","3875240"," But you'll make as much money though."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3875240","3877240"," Or you risk more to me."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3877240","3879240"," That's hard to explain."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3879240","3881240"," You would define risk and options."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3881240","3882240"," A big burn on me."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3882240","3883240"," They burn on me."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3883240","3884240"," One way or another."
"wNLurfJBQoE","3884240","3886240"," So we got to talk about that."
