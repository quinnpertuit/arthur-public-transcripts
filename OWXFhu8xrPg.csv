"85310","87370"," This market regime is going to come with more volatility."
"90090","91350"," Turn that off, give it to you guys."
"91530","92710"," Give me just one sec quick second here. "
"92830","93570"," I got a couple things you got to do."
"102730","104650"," Let's get some technical stuff in the background."
"104850","105670"," I got to take care of it. "
"106150","107770"," I got some weirdness going on this morning too."
"107910","116330"," I've got setting up a new studio and I've got a lot of wonkiness going on."
"132790","133450"," Good morning. "
"133610","135830"," How's everybody's weekend, by the way?"
"137790","140210"," I don't know what is going on with this."
"141110","145110"," Oh, maybe more."
"145470","145950"," I need more. "
"161180","162800"," That's kind of helping."
"163660","164420"," That's pretty good."
"166140","166860"," Good morning. "
"166960","167260"," Good morning."
"177460","178920"," Just one second here."
"197360","199220"," What am I missing here?"
"200440","201120"," Missing something. "
"202300","202880"," There we go."
"204280","205220"," Let's see if that..."
"207980","209820"," You know, good morning."
"210040","210940"," Hold on to the second here. "
"211040","212040"," I got a couple more things you got to do."
"212600","218760"," I'm setting up a new office space in the Bank of England, guilt sale results for the week."
"220100","221240"," I couldn't hear that. "
"225220","235160"," So just keeping an eye on the opening moves as well here."
"235360","237420"," S&P 500 erased that opening move."
"237620","239440"," It's still up, zero spot, four percent on the session. "
"240780","244480"," We're going to talk about the S&P right now, right where it's at."
"244480","247900"," What does it mean?"
"250140","252220"," I can burn this out a little bit."
"256740","261100"," Got some gaps to close down below from the open this morning right down here. "
"261200","263540"," I don't know if you can see them on your screen or right there and there."
"264280","265440"," Some quick gaps to close."
"266420","269720"," I'm going to turn this into it. "

"294280","302100"," I ordered some new monitor holders."
"302620","303440"," They're not here right now."
"303880","305640"," I've got monitors but no monitor holders. "
"308360","309440"," So that's all wonky."
"309520","314160"," The Bank of England sells 790 million pounds of bonds in an auction, receiving one spot to five"

"319120","320240"," So bear with me today. "
"320640","321980"," Bear with me with the camera and the microphone."
"321980","331410"," The microphone is like whacked out of the way and I've got screens that are like I got a"
"331410","339310"," screen on like whatever comes in."
"339430","340030"," Hold on one second here. "
"356740","362140"," Apple selling off on the open this morning, further selling off in Apple."
"362140","363920"," Looks like pretty pretty ugly right now."
"365020","369140"," Now we want to talk to you about our Friday clothes here. "
"370640","372140"," Let's get back over here."
"376020","381080"," So in the Friday clothes, remember we had the hourly trigger."
"387770","390530"," We sold off on this hourly trigger somewhere up here. "
"391170","393990"," I don't exactly remember where but it's somewhere up here."
"394950","399230"," We knew that the hourly trigger would march down over the weekend, right?"
"400070","406690"," Kind of match up to the open this morning."
"406690","416490"," We expected the weekend to get bought and we're also expecting some cells off the hourly"
"416490","416990"," trigger. "
"417330","425240"," Now there's there's something to talk about here with this hourly trigger."
"425540","432020"," Now we're going to talk about this hourly trigger and its importance and what the attempt is here."
"437610","440410"," We're going to switch over to the trigger screen. "
"441010","447650"," Now there's something in progress here, right?"
"447870","452310"," So you saw the hourly trigger was way up here following my cursor and we knew the hourly trigger"
"452310","453950"," would come back down over the weekend."
"455110","457570"," So far the spy is holding."
"459190","462050"," Given that, there's a couple of things to say here. "
"462330","467090"," Remember what, it's not that easy to drop the S&P 500 to spy."
"468450","471810"," We're having a pullback or correction either."
"473670","479130"," It's still not an easy thing to, you know, create a turn of correction to a crash. "
"480770","485430"," Actually, I'm actually really far away from the whole crash."
"492290","494530"," So we're watching this right now."
"497530","503270"," So I got some new monitors so it can get that better. "
"505590","511409"," The first thing is this, whether we have the pullback or the correction, the S&P 500 is not one"
"511409","512010"," company, right?"
"512110","514030"," It's not Tesla, it's not Apple, anything like that."
"515710","517630"," And there's two notes to make here."
"518450","521230"," We can rotate into other sectors. "
"521669","524570"," We'll take a look at some sectors this morning as well."
"525590","530310"," As some sectors have been murdered, they're straight down at like three to five percent push"
"530310","531450"," stocks."
"531570","538170"," There could be some rotation but also to a key point here to know it would be, as they come"
"538170","542470"," down on this daily trigger, it still has not given it up yet. "
"543450","546810"," And the hourly trigger has not crossed below the daily trigger."
"547090","550890"," So this is something that we're looking for that has not happened yet."
"551110","558810"," So if we're going to just show you the daily trigger here and see the daily trigger is marching"
"558810","559250"," higher. "
"559870","566770"," You can also see that the hourly trigger is not crossed below the daily trigger yet with price"
"566770","571750"," leading the way to the downside on the S&P 500."
"572170","577630"," To turn this in from, we actually still haven't confirmed a correction at this point."
"578030","578870"," I know it sounds crazy. "
"579510","580670"," I know that you want it to be."
"580930","582890"," I kind of want it to be two to some extent."
"583730","588010"," We'll talk about that later too because I have to make a decision if I'm going to sit around here"
"588010","590050"," for two or three months or not. "
"590270","597350"," But at this point, there still has been no confirmation, no three trigger, four trigger cluster to"
"597350","599350"," the downside yet on the S&P 500."
"599670","601050"," At least on spy, there hasn't been."
"601230","605590"," And we'll look at ES and SPX as well. "
"605590","609670"," So as far as this looks right now, we're still not there."
"610530","613210"," Now, this is all in the Bears Court, right?"
"613410","616650"," Bears are selling off of this daily trigger."
"617410","620070"," And they're attempting to sell off it again today. "
"620290","621350"," This is what they want to do."
"622070","623590"," I don't know if they're going to be successful."
"623810","628410"," I don't think they're going to be successful until possibly Wednesday or Thursday. "
"630250","631650"," If they are going to be successful."
"631810","638650"," I don't think they're most certainly is."
"640910","648030"," So if they're right, if they're right, now that we're getting a correction, we're going to know it"
"648030","648950"," pretty quickly. "
"649630","659510"," You're going to be looking for price to not only get underneath, but close underneath, right?"
"659890","660570"," And hold underneath."
"661390","662570"," That didn't happen over the weekend."
"663670","667350"," So this is kind of turning, taking aside the bull side at least for right now. "
"668250","675070"," And Bears really want to get price in the early, the early to cross below the daily price to get"
"675070","678970"," underneath, begin to reject and get some power to the downside."
"679850","684990"," Start using that hourly trigger and hourly velo to their, to their benefit."
"685930","688590"," You can see right now you're not going to get underneath the daily trigger. "
"689090","692170"," That's this yellow line with just the one in the five minute."
"692570","696610"," You need that hourly to get underneath and start to push lower with velo."
"696870","697990"," Not having that. "
"699790","701350"," Not having that right now."
"701350","702450"," You can see it right now."
"702770","707790"," Some bullsh on today actually, and I believe in bullsh on tomorrow until these Wednesday or"
"707790","708430"," Thursday. "
"708450","710350"," So we're going to see how this plays itself out."
"711050","711870"," We're going to take a look around them."
"711970","712990"," We got a bunch of stuff to look at today. "
"713050","713350"," It's a Monday."
"713890","716750"," So we're going to go across the market and check some other stuff."
"717230","718370"," We're going to check Brad. "
"718490","722510"," We're going to check some cycle stuff that looks pretty bearish."
"723990","728250"," And for that correction and we'll get to all that."
"728290","730830"," We've looked at this I think a week or two ago on a Sunday. "
"731170","733750"," And so we'll take a look at it again today and see what it looks like."
"734610","741570"," But as of right now, the market's still holding up even with a sell off in Apple, believe it or"
"741570","741750"," not."
"741870","743070"," We also have a soft and Tesla. "
"743650","745790"," We'll talk about that news this morning."
"746730","749030"," And what is what a CFO is to a company."
"749470","757810"," I think I think a lot of people don't know the entire job of a CFO. "
"758070","762170"," If it's CFO had a position, there's a classic sense of what a CFO is."
"762790","766490"," And then there's the idea of them bringing money to the company, the importance, the right"
"766490","770330"," handedness of that person to the CEO of a company."
"771990","775110"," CFO is to me my experience in C-suites. "
"775790","778370"," CFO is like Donald Rumsfeld."
"778550","781290"," They're like Darth Vader to the emperor."
"781950","783930"," Whether the emperor is good or bad does it matter. "
"784270","791190"," CFO is a very important position critical to a company expanding growth, all kinds of stuff."
"791530","794730"," So we'll talk about that in depth at some point today as well."
"795710","796490"," Then it's implications. "
"806350","809530"," So you can see that we are below Arlie Trigger right now."
"809530","810450"," We're going to pay attention to this."
"810490","812170"," This is kind of a key battleground on a Monday. "
"813630","816050"," There's that same representation here."
"816430","819670"," So you can put this on your charts right around 44883."
"820670","822250"," There's a big yellow bar down here. "
"822690","826890"," We do as they said earlier have three, let me zoom in and draw them in."
"829540","830880"," Get some gaps down here."
"831540","832040"," Tiny little gaps. "
"841530","843190"," Little gap down here."
"843230","844470"," Let me draw one."
"846310","847670"," Just bear with me today. "
"847830","849510"," I've got technical issues."
"850270","858850"," I'm building a second studio and it's not going my way."
"859390","864930"," I had some computers come in and I'm not happy with what I received. "
"865530","868650"," And then I have monitors that I'm happy and not happy with what I received."
"869570","871070"," So you can see these gaps down below."
"873730","874650"," I shouldn't say that. "
"874750","881110"," Of all the equipment that I bought, I had to buy a bunch of stuff and it was like 60"
"881110","883770"," to 70 percent there."
"885090","886330"," What I wanted to be."
"887030","888450"," Just watch that right there. "
"917220","920000"," Second studio is kind of cool because I can run streams."
"920400","925340"," The issue that I'm having right now is I can't run the stream and do the work that I need"
"925340","927500"," to do when I'm not streaming."
"927820","929260"," So when I run like I can't be here. "
"930920","938060"," I've got other responsibilities to what we're doing that forced me to use this computing power and"
"938060","939420"," I don't have that ability."
"940500","947540"," So now I do ish have that ability to enclose these gaps down below."
"947940","951740"," Let's see if they can tag this pre-market low price target down below. "
"957160","959520"," I've got another one even lower than that too."
"960160","961780"," I've got three targets to the downside."
"971560","973460"," This is the previous low from Friday. "
"975260","977880"," I'm assuming this is what a bear setup is."
"979960","985310"," Hold on there."
"986590","988110"," I've got some freezing going on. "
"991810","992810"," Oh no I don't."
"993130","993570"," Okay hold on."
"994270","994830"," I'm just missing it. "
"1002920","1005220"," It's previous low from Friday right here."
"1008460","1013880"," This would be the setup for bears if they wanted one on a Monday."
"1018770","1020710"," No no no no no. "
"1022190","1024010"," What is going on?"
"1024349","1024890"," Stop."
"1033990","1036589"," You can see that nice cross coming down right here."
"1036750","1042910"," This white line red line calling about this right here. "
"1045390","1052910"," Tag this right here for that pre-market or pre-market low and then actually come down here and tag"
"1052910","1053730"," this stuff here."
"1060000","1061640"," Now that gap is showing up."
"1062440","1064320"," I actually see that gap now finally popping. "
"1069060","1071320"," Move some of this over because it's not going to be all by it."
"1071320","1073140"," It's not going to happen by 9.30 I don't think."
"1080830","1082770"," I guess it could happen by morning. "
"1083190","1084090"," Let me slide those back over."
"1096170","1096950"," Something like that."
"1096950","1097970"," You can see it right here. "
"1106800","1109320"," It did make good money on calls this morning."
"1110060","1114280"," So I guess right down there down here clean all this garbage up."
"1114520","1117380"," Come back up here and start moving this down. "
"1124390","1126050"," What do I think you get this today?"
"1126430","1127310"," I doubt it."
"1128630","1130170"," This might come back up here."
"1132410","1134570"," Then later in the morning you might get that over there. "
"1139290","1140750"," The first gap is out."
"1154440","1156540"," I actually didn't lose money on Friday too."
"1156640","1157600"," I was kind of happy about that. "
"1158360","1160820"," I made money on Friday not as much as I had started with."
"1161620","1166440"," Then I did lose some money into the close on Friday that when it cost me my earlier winnings of"
"1166440","1172200"," the day I did hold some calls overnight into this morning over the weekend into this morning."
"1172460","1173320"," I took the money from that. "
"1173420","1174420"," That was a 200% winner."
"1175900","1179180"," Then now we're looking to see if we can catch a dip buy or not."
"1179820","1184880"," This setup here, this setup I'm drawing in right now is not. "
"1185860","1188940"," You don't want to see this setup right as the hours pass."
"1189500","1195320"," You would see the hourly trigger come down and start to create a very volatile and dangerous"
"1195320","1196780"," situation for bulls."
"1198040","1205060"," I want to see bulls get above this hourly trigger and hold it at some point. "
"1206220","1209860"," We're going to watch that play out today, tomorrow, Wednesday, Thursday."
"1210500","1212060"," We know a lot on the economic calendar."
"1216230","1216750"," We're going to bring this up. "
"1217970","1219710"," We've got consumer credit at 3PM today."
"1219990","1222030"," 3PM is unusual for news for us."
"1222230","1223690"," We'll make sure we pay attention to that. "
"1224270","1228010"," Tuesday, we've got the NFIB Optimism Index at 6AM."
"1228410","1234610"," Philly Fed, Harker is speaking at 8.15. US trade balance at 8.30 and Barkan is speaking at 8 "
"1234610","1237830",".30. US wholesale inventories on Tuesday at 10."
"1239610","1242450"," Nothing scheduled for the ninth for Wednesday. "
"1243010","1244410"," A couple days with no vol."
"1244990","1250790"," I think that's where the setup is is between Monday and Wednesday for a larger move to the"
"1250790","1251010"," downside."
"1252110","1255770"," We're setting up on Thursday claims, of course, CPI. "
"1256030","1257350"," CPI, year-of-year, blah, blah, blah."
"1257510","1261270"," That stuff at 8.30. Treasury budget budget at 2."
"1261890","1268730"," The big boy, the PPI and course, PPI year-of-year and consumer sentiments on the 11th."
"1268790","1272290"," We'll also talk about this stuff coming up on Thursday and Friday. "
"1273490","1279270"," As you know, inflation has been coming down, but it does spike on the way down."
"1279430","1284530"," This could be the setup that bears have been looking for into the weekend."
"1284890","1287470"," We'll keep an eye on this as the week progresses. "
"1291700","1301520"," Kirkhorn is down, Tesla down 2.92%, Apple down 1.98%, some rotation into Google and misfit."
"1317640","1327530"," I've had a target on Apple from their"
"1327530","1330390"," earnings."
"1333980","1336460"," So this here was their implied move. "
"1337700","1339780"," They got their implied move to the upside."
"1341000","1342960"," This was their implied move to the downside."
"1343420","1346140"," They tagged this one here, tagged this one here. "
"1347080","1354600"," And if they did not have a stellar ER, their next target down below was right down here to 174 "
"1354600","1357640",".74 with this green box down here."
"1357680","1363580"," So they're getting pretty close right now to a place to buy the market, or not buy the market by"
"1363580","1365300"," Apple, and of course, and turn the market."
"1365940","1368700"," So 174.61 down here. "
"1370180","1371000"," Almost there."
"1371900","1373240"," Should get a bounce actually right now."
"1373240","1374340"," It's looking like I might catch a bounce. "
"1376480","1377800"," You can look at it in a one minute."
"1381390","1382570"," No, no bounce."
"1384210","1387210"," I would not trust any bounces on Apple right now. "
"1397410","1399270"," Any bounces should be sold."
"1400650","1402610"," We'll leave that there so we can come back and look at it."
"1407670","1411470"," Ultimately, the price target of 174.61 is somewhere in there. "
"1413910","1416770"," We'll get Tesla really quick as well as that one is selling off."
"1427040","1436780"," Talked about 262 being a magnet for Tesla, but also you remember that after the ER we discussed"
"1436780","1440600"," the actual target being down here at 225."
"1441680","1445580"," You have an expectation of that continuation of the downside on Tesla as well. "
"1445580","1448680"," So we'll put another box down here."
"1453790","1455330"," Right down here in Tesla."
"1464280","1468320"," You can recall the conversation we had about Tesla with failures to close. "
"1468960","1471060"," This is all extremely bearish here, right?"
"1471900","1474320"," Failure to close this gap right here."
"1474900","1475920"," Failure to close."
"1479320","1480060"," Excuse me. "
"1480920","1482980"," Failure to close this gap below."
"1484100","1488080"," The first one and then of course the second one not even not even a thought right."
"1488920","1496280"," No failure definitely a failure to get above this gap right here to consolidate to even attempt"
"1496280","1499080"," this gap with that out of place. "
"1499100","1503100"," You already know down here that we're looking for lower lows on Tesla."
"1504000","1505720"," We're going to be looking for that 230."
"1506260","1512740"," Now one note on Tesla, maybe not as much Apple, but you are going to find just like on the"
"1512740","1518440"," sell side you will sometimes find buyers stepping earlier than expected. "
"1520220","1526180"," So 232 price target on Tesla whereas Apple you might get a clean bounce."
"1527180","1528840"," Tesla can sometimes blast through too."
"1529220","1532100"," So we'll wait and see if we get that target. "
"1533260","1535860"," If we catch the bounce and hourly can come down."
"1536000","1536900"," I'm going to show you guys some on Tesla."
"1540850","1542010"," What it would look like. "
"1547360","1549460"," It's kind of two paths here for Tesla."
"1550360","1551940"," This is the hourly trigger."
"1553520","1555240"," There is one path for hourly trigger. "
"1556380","1558480"," Here's the other path for hourly trigger."
"1560280","1562940"," We'll talk about daily as well here in just a moment."
"1563320","1567380"," This is what I prefer to trade on Tesla is the daily fellow. "
"1568180","1574680"," But even so if Tesla at any point is able to control itself and get above hourly we could probably"
"1574680","1577880"," trade back up into that 262."
"1579180","1581140"," But I don't think that's going to happen."
"1581220","1586320"," I think we're going to stay underneath and blast down here and you're not going to be able to take"
"1586320","1588920"," a trade unless they can recover the hourly trigger. "
"1589320","1591800"," Then we'll start to look to take this trade higher."
"1592180","1595320"," Daily trigger should come down below and trade about 244."
"1596300","1599100"," It can gain above with the hourly and daily trigger. "
"1599840","1601680"," It'll be an even better trade around 244."
"1602420","1606460"," So we're going to look right now on daily fellow."
"1611530","1613390"," And why I like trading this. "
"1613650","1615690"," I just want you to see this down below here."
"1616970","1618790"," Watch to see this bellow down below."
"1619070","1627550"," One good thing to note here too for you if you are a Tesla bull is price is not following. "
"1627770","1629410"," I know this looks destructive to you."
"1630030","1633090"," I'm sure that to you you're like this is the end of the world for Tesla."
"1634170","1636490"," World is ending for Tesla with that price move. "
"1637230","1642930"," But in truthfulness and all truthfulness Tesla is not bearish right now."
"1643630","1650370"," And just this price coming down is not as bad as you may think that it is."
"1650950","1658630"," This could be double right now believe it or not for how much a fellow has blown off for bulls"
"1658630","1660450"," without price following. "
"1661010","1667490"," So right down here on this daily fellow down here we can see this fellow come back down to some"
"1667490","1670870"," negative numbers negative negative 25 negative 50 somewhere down there."
"1671530","1676650"," And if price is not followed we can get price down just down around here somewhere."
"1678770","1683510"," I'd be keen to to buy Tesla once again. "
"1684750","1685410"," Definitely."
"1685850","1691970"," Whenever we get these nice deep cuts in Tesla to know how volatile it is to get down here start"
"1691970","1692330"," blasting."
"1693030","1699870"," Another note on this fellow is well you can usually try to buy some of this stuff in here and"
"1699870","1703110"," then buy some of this stuff in here this would be the first buy and then the second buy. "
"1703770","1705730"," So there could be two buys coming up on Tesla."
"1706910","1713310"," It would look something like this blast on down right push up get a nice little dip by here."
"1713850","1717130"," It rolls back down again then there's that second move higher. "
"1717710","1722270"," It should be one then two nice two nice buys on Tesla somewhere here."
"1722730","1725190"," Maybe you don't buy that one be a buy this one right up in here."
"1725910","1730910"," So you have one buy two buys and it'll be a nice nice dip buy for Tesla as well. "
"1737540","1742440"," You'll get spy right there man my sexy my beautiful spy still holding it up."
"1743200","1746000"," Three turn cluster right now on spy."
"1751000","1755680"," I'm trying to grind through these sellers you can see them above a wall of sellers up here. "
"1761840","1763640"," You can see them right there right there."
"1763660","1765780"," They've come down you see these sellers here."
"1766480","1768440"," If you look at the heat map above here. "
"1769720","1774500"," We know the sellers are coming down they're marching down more aggressively than they ever have in"
"1774500","1776820"," maybe March."
"1777700","1781640"," I haven't seen this this aggressiveness pull in here."
"1781700","1782580"," I'm gonna look for a trade. "
"1824410","1827010"," Yeah spy it's not really that spy has to fight."
"1827350","1836550"," It's that the one good thing about even in 2020 even in 2021 spy went up right."
"1836850","1837490"," Hughes went up. "
"1837910","1842290"," These aren't the only holdings in in these indexes."
"1842810","1850530"," It's one of the ones you know oftentimes when you see a high flyer and out performer spy will trade"
"1850530","1853330"," sideways or cues will trade sideways or slightly up."
"1854670","1861550"," It's not as easy to crash the S&P 500 and there are other tickers to rotate into. "
"1861690","1867550"," Matter of fact we traded S&P 500 for almost the entire year right up until I should say almost"
"1867550","1869030"," up until the end of the year."
"1869510","1877370"," Inspired did not follow suit with the massive correction that took place in the underlying during"
"1877370","1878110"," that year right."
"1878390","1885290"," It was more resilient than individual tickers are seeing blood today in Tesla and Apple and not the"
"1885290","1887410"," same response in the S&P 500. "
"1918040","1920620"," I'm going to move this down to a one-minute down below here."
"1921880","1924080"," Just keep an eye on Apple down here."
"1925820","1928440"," So this is Apple's chart down below in a one-minute. "
"1932530","1951750"," Move this over and just see V2IG"
"1951750","1952410"," looking bullish."
"1953450","1955590"," We have to talk about the VIX today as well."
"1956670","1960530"," See if I can swear because I have it on a different computer. "
"1964500","1965340"," Oh now baby."
"1966280","1973530"," Keep on going up with this last little target up here."
"1976300","1977820"," Move this one slightly higher. "
"1979220","1980160"," So right there."
"1982520","1984400"," Looking for this trade right here up to this one."
"2003900","2006080"," Then some 450 C's right now. "
"2056770","2061969"," I'm possibly interested in read by PayPal and online list as well."

"2067870","2068770"," indicating neutral."

"2103750","2104510"," I've got a whole bunch. "
"2104610","2106350"," We have a whole bunch of stuff we have to look at this morning."
"2106490","2109430"," Probably we're probably going to get to it and we'll get into Tesla at some point."
"2111390","2113710"," We got a bunch of crap we got to look at. "
"2115980","2117480"," We could do that right now."
"2120340","2124380"," Because I've got we're talking about a bunch of stuff."
"2126540","2136040"," So I'm on the train of six thousand but I'm"
"2136040","2137920"," on a larger train. "
"2138340","2139960"," So here's some questions for you this morning."
"2140080","2141000"," Let me ask you guys something."
"2144900","2146600"," What's going to sound crazy right. "
"2149780","2157480"," So I was talking to my kids this weekend and we were discussing."
"2159020","2160780"," So it's really weird."
"2161120","2169380"," I don't know how this conversation began but my so I'm very liberal. "
"2169380","2170480"," I want you guys to know that."
"2170740","2171580"," It's a pretty liberal person."
"2171680","2173140"," I'll talk about my politics too frequently. "
"2174200","2179740"," Some people call me like to call me like a LBJ kind of an old school Democrat."
"2181780","2183900"," They can go by different different names."
"2184680","2185940"," I serve my country too. "
"2186080","2189240"," So I believe in owning guns and all that kind of stuff."
"2190460","2192940"," But also believe in protecting people's rights that kind of stuff right."
"2193140","2199760"," There's why I know my politics as I don't know why I'm telling you this but I'm very liberal. "
"2200140","2202060"," I don't bring it on to the show that kind of stuff."
"2202940","2205040"," Business owner to own multiple businesses."
"2206360","2212360"," So you know I'm kind of like you know it's always it's always a challenge to be who I am"
"2212360","2212620"," right. "
"2214220","2215560"," My landlord too right."
"2215660","2215940"," I'm not a landlord."
"2216360","2217380"," I do Airbnb's. "
"2217540","2220460"," Scroung of the of you know everybody says that's the scroung of everything."
"2221460","2228800"," So you can't always I have a hard time fitting into politically have a hard time fitting into a"
"2228800","2237080"," political system that is built to put everyone at odds with each other at all times right."
"2238660","2248640"," Now I went and saw Barbie with my wife and children and they"
"2248640","2249580"," were I didn't care. "
"2249800","2252800"," I was like yeah this is a woman or a movie for women and kids."
"2253420","2256520"," I was like I don't know what this is going to be or what it means."
"2257840","2261480"," And why I'm not a woman right. "
"2262200","2267760"," So I'm not going to attempt I can have compassion or empathy but it's hard for me to identify"
"2267760","2269840"," because I don't have the experience."
"2270200","2274320"," I didn't grow up as a woman or a young woman or a young lady or a daughter or anything"
"2274320","2275160"," that kind of stuff."
"2275900","2281620"," It was kind of fascinating because when we left my kids and my wife were just kind of like yeah"
"2281620","2290000"," we didn't like pick up on or think what the reasonings why they didn't enjoy it. "
"2291380","2298300"," When my my wife and kids basically said to me that it's for women get fucked over all the time"
"2298300","2298600"," everywhere."
"2299180","2300140"," All their experiences."
"2300340","2307140"," My kids have never had that experience or or maybe just glimpses of it. "
"2307500","2310920"," So my kids couldn't identify with a lot of topics in that movie."
"2312460","2313320"," Now they will."
"2313860","2318380"," I'm sure now they get a lot of homeschooling and then their private schools for most of their"
"2318380","2318680"," childhood. "
"2319560","2327140"," And then they live in a house with a guy who has been with my wife since for a long"
"2327140","2327820"," time."
"2328940","2332740"," And I don't know about you but I don't run my house."
"2333000","2334540"," I'm not the boss of my home. "
"2335380","2345380"," And I've been very successful as a husband and father for me at least to you know not"
"2345380","2349340"," be not be try to be supportive of my wife my daughters."
"2349340","2350660"," This is terrible to say."
"2350960","2352880"," I don't know if I'm saying this properly but anyways. "
"2354360","2361100"," I brought about it led into another conversation and you know or at least for in my house and how"
"2361100","2363000"," how we live and stuff like that."
"2363420","2369840"," We don't my kids are like I love my dad my dad's awesome and you know like all that kind"
"2369840","2370140"," of stuff."
"2371300","2375420"," So I don't you know like don't treat my kids poorly or anything like that. "
"2375760","2385160"," So but it led into another conversation about finances for kids for women for children in general."
"2385160","2390580"," Boys girls doesn't matter but it led this whole conversation rolled into a different conversation"
"2390580","2399340"," about specifically about like my kids right like teaching them how to save money teaching how to be"
"2399340","2405080"," financially responsible for themselves and get degrees and that kind of stuff so they can always"
"2405080","2405960"," take care of themselves."
"2407160","2416300"," And so the conversation then delved into hey daddy why don't we do a show for investing for kids"
"2416300","2418000"," like savings account that kind of stuff. "
"2418200","2423740"," So big long conversation over the weekend about investing and what it ended up turning into two was"
"2423740","2432540"," I was like you might not want to be buying any stock right now in these in these companies they're"
"2432540","2437700"," like let's do a show we'll put like a thousand bucks in each account for each daughter and start a"
"2437700","2442480"," clean a clean like investment account for them."
"2443180","2444720"," So I'm like okay that sounds good."
"2445680","2452500"," So we wind up discussing this over the weekend and I'm doing my research this weekend and I'm"
"2452500","2460060"," thinking of course through this whole entire thing I'm like well I'm always preaching that there's"
"2460060","2468380"," the right time they're okay I keep going I've traded 63 cents and of course I'm like is this the"
"2468380","2475920"," right time it probably is the right time to buy but in a larger scale in a higher time frame"
"2475920","2484740"," like weekly monthly time frames is it a good time to buy is the question because my their time"
"2484740","2488300"," frame versus my time frame is different right. "
"2489220","2499220"," I'm not looking to hold the stock market for 20 30 40 years anything like that trade enough 449"
"2499220","2509020"," 72 looking for a target above here of 449 88 trading 67 cents right now in 450 C."
"2511080","2516820"," I'm about to exit off this bar up here and try to rebuy again to the upside so I'll try"
"2516820","2525450"," to take this off here in just a moment and look for another entry to this side right here to"
"2525450","2527190"," 450 99."
"2534960","2541380"," So this conversation we're having it like leads and leads and leads and leads and I'm always"
"2541380","2548400"," looking for like is it or getting a pullback or getting a correction is this a top but oftentimes"
"2548400","2559220"," the last time I think I looked on cyclical I'm going"
"2559220","2569040"," to take 65 there so cyclical nature last time twice last year I looked Joe"
"2569040","2578220"," Joe Donut and I will spend time once every six months to a year and we will look at the"
"2578220","2585860"," cyclical nature of the stock market that's multi-year like one year oh not one like five years 10"
"2585860","2595860"," years 15 years and what are the expectations and we talked about we've talked about like how deep"
"2595860","2602260"," can it go the selling how high can it go over these time periods what we'll be looking at in"
"2602260","2608140"," those years and I came across an article over the weekend that I'm going to bring up for you here"
"2608140","2615180"," in just a few and try to get your thoughts on it because you know they're talking about the S "
"2615180","2625140","&P 500 scribbling so trading like 15,000 the next 10"
"2625140","2634820"," to 15 years so I'm talking to my daughters about investment accounts and you know how I'm going to"
"2634820","2644000"," hold these things my youngest you know that would put her at you know 25 years older so my youngest"
"2644000","2648140"," or my eldest will miss out on some of that but I'll still put her into her late 20s early"
"2648140","2657820"," 30s and the expectation on this cycle is that in the next this is going to sound crazy"
"2657820","2664160"," the next like 10 to 15 years but not not next year but I'm talking not for another 10 or"
"2664160","2676260"," 15 years the stock market should go through a major sideways and down decade"
"2676260","2684300"," five years to 10 years of a market that does not trade higher so I have children and I'm looking"
"2684300","2693160"," at my kids and I'm thinking well do we experience that now for the next five years of a sideways"
"2693160","2703000"," market or is this something that gets pushed off into 10 or 15 years from now does this"
"2703000","2711240"," money that came into the market was this a generational buying up or generational generational"
"2711240","2721240"," governmental uh a transfer of wealth that's taking place that might play out longer than just"
"2721240","2730420"," the two or three years it could play out for 10 or 15 years so"
"2730420","2740180"," is anybody out there talking about S&P 500 to 15,000 anybody"
"2740180","2748060"," at all I'm doubting it I'll be honest I'm going to assume that not many people are looking at I'm"
"2749630","2759530"," going to assume that most people are not looking at S&P 500 15,000 and those kind"
"2759530","2769150"," of timeframes so which is kind of shocking so when I look at the S&P 500 right now I'm"
"2769150","2773570"," like well I guess what they did want to buy when this this how it comes circles right back to"
"2773570","2782390"," myself I have a lot of holdings in the stock market and my time frame on this stuff yeah some"
"2782390","2789180"," of it's three years some of it is um some of it is three years and some of it is"
"2790500","2800000"," three months to a year but none of it is geared towards none of it is geared towards uh 10"
"2800000","2809900"," or 15 years and I haven't thought on that scale for myself since I"
"2809900","2819880"," was 21 maybe 22 something like that when I first started I was like yeah I'll start doing 401k"

"3880370","3888670"," shares of the spy it's going to be kind of boring so my second thought was for them to look"
"3888670","3898310"," at smaller ETFs they're cheaper uh so they could buy multiples so maybe they get some exposure"
"3900130","3906350"," two things that they enjoy in an ETF that's that's got a better price on it so i don't know"
"3906350","3913490"," yet if we're going to if we're going to buy physical stock or partial shares there's a possibility"
"3913490","3919790"," that they could buy just partial of some of these companies and put some risk on some companies not"

"3977760","3986260"," a part of my life where i buy and hold maybe some maybe look for growth and growth tickers and"
"3986260","3993620"," then consolidate that money into a longer term ownership of the market and i've never been like"
"3993620","4000580"," that in my entire life i think this is probably the first time where i'm considering just owning"

"8819520","8826520"," for the real true and this is kind of just kind of like later in the week here that i'm"

"8833600","8838820"," would continue to Friday down here and then maybe next week at some points start talking about"
"8838820","8846460"," heading higher uh so you're you're looking for these sellers to step in somewhere above here okay"
"8846460","8853260"," just up in here if now this is if sellers are still in control right so in a smaller time"
"8853260","8860420"," frame on a five-minute time frame here right this is that same price target right here and you're"
"8860420","8870420"," going to look for spoos today tomorrow Wednesday to trade this to find out if sellers actually are"
"8870420","8879800"," still in control looking for bad news into uh later in the week so if currently price target above"
"8879800","8889580"," uh 4137 now that's these beans were still bearish here right uh you can actually see"
"8889580","8896460"," hyg heading down risk coming off the market uh so price can diverge from hyg and we can trade this"
"8896460","8902340"," believe it or not it's it's possible we trade this into the end of day today tuesday or wednesday"
"8902340","8909460"," it's also a good place for sellers to sell the market again is that this number this number will"
"8909460","8917080"," come down as we get into tuesday and wednesday but for today's target upside target 4137 and that"
"8917080","8922140"," number will will drop over time uh today tomorrow the next day that kind of stuff but i think we're"
"8922140","8926960"," going here today probably not i think we could easily though get our one four fifty ninety nine"
"8926960","8937120"," bounce around consolidate and the reason i'm saying that is because if you go to the trigger the"
"8939720","8945100"," other triggers this all looks bullish here okay so if you look at the triggers here this all looks"
"8945100","8953020"," pretty bullish the more time that we spend on the daily trigger the more bullish we become and"
"8953020","8958320"," we're not seeing the daily trigger roll down do we we're not seeing like the yellow line rolling"
"8958320","8966040"," down this is not even indicative of uh uh correction that would be indicative of uh a top in the"
"8966040","8970500"," market right people are saying this is the top we're not going back up i completely disagree with"
"8970500","8979500"," those people and to to further that point uh you'll likely see daily trigger stay up here even if"
"8979500","8985740"," price rolls so if you see price roll here and continue down and if you see the the daily triggers"
"8985740","8992580"," stay high up here or not come down heavily that would be indicative of a correction still and not"
"8992580","9000860"," this is the top that's being called for out there uh so right now bulls uh bulls have the chance"
"9000860","9010920"," right now to at least trade trade"
"9010920","9015400"," up here to some kind of a sell point here right kind of a you can see it's nice and"
"9015400","9021240"," bullish here nice trade at least up to there into where the bears are going to want to take back"
"9021240","9027680"," over and sell it down hyg is not looking promising right now good look promising once we get up"
"9027680","9037600"," there now for that bloodbath and that eventual attempt to tag 440 close"
"9037600","9044960"," those gaps down below and find the next known support you also have a lower uh a lower place to"
"9044960","9051240"," look for that's 428 to 432 on spy as well we'll talk to you guys about why i'm saying this"
"9051240","9058140"," stuff too um now if we begin to trade higher let's say we break above if you're a bull out"
"9058140","9063080"," there and you're like well cap i'm super bullish here i think you're wrong you still take the money"
"9063080","9070820"," and run as we trade up here you still take the money and run as we trade up here right"
"9070820","9078000"," you you exit the market you allow the algorithms to push us above and you allow the the hourly"
"9078000","9085400"," trigger and the one and the five to come up and show you the way to start to attack the"
"9085400","9091680"," scene of the crime over here and we can trade each level all the way up if we like watch"
"9091680","9096460"," the failure come back down and see if we can have some continuation of the upside to buy this here"
"9096460","9102380"," okay so bulls right now are bulls right now are not in charge of this market i want to be"
"9102380","9108660"," clear with you they are not and when i talk to bears about having to be tactful if you're a"
"9108660","9113380"," bull you need to be tactful right now bears have no need to be tactful all they have to do"
"9113380","9122320"," right now is be short this market uh they also all they have to do is they can sell right"
"9122320","9128360"," here which they already have they can sell right here and they can sit back that's all they have to"
"9128360","9133480"," do sit back and not not worry about it uh they can pull out their weekly puts right here you"
"9133480","9138480"," can put on their weekly the more weekly puts right here and right now this is their market to do"
"9138480","9144120"," that for for Friday okay so be aware of that that they're sitting back right now and they're"
"9144120","9151200"," drinking their their margaritas or their whatever they're they're drinking for the rest of this"
"9151200","9158080"," week so be aware that pairs are in charge they're in comfort right now even though we look like"
"9158080","9164320"," we're bullish here right on this trigger screen it's showing bullish all this is holding right now"
"9164320","9171440"," the daily trigger is holding we talked about bears being 11 0 for 11 on the daily trigger right 0"
"9171440","9179380"," 0 for 11 currently still 0 for 11 but they are setting this up you see how they're getting their"
"9179380","9186320"," work done they're doing what they need to do to sell this down for a correction so they're doing"
"9186320","9191330"," what they're supposed to be doing the bears still have this at this point you should be aware of"
"9191330","9197750"," that as a bull and you should also be aware that you have lots of work to do to get"
"9197750","9205110"," back on track of being in charge of this market now we're going to look at something else here i'm"
"9205110","9214090"," going to actually bring this above here so you can get a better you can get a better look at"
"9214090","9221790"," this uh some concern not full concern but some concerning stuff about uh spy and i want to show you"
"9221790","9227890"," take care to show your attention to this now we're not in a we haven't broke trend in any way"
"9227890","9233750"," shape or form and spy want you to notice that nothing's broken trend here downside target for spy"
"9233750","9241010"," is this 432 down here just down here in this 432 they expect some kind of squeeze here and then"
"9241010","9246550"," some kind of bloodbath down here to this 430 432 and you would still be on trend to the upside"
"9246550","9253870"," for spy okay so there are bulls out there that want to see us trade this 432 as well if"
"9253870","9261990"," you look at if you look right now at market breadth utilities are down to three we're down in the"
"9261990","9268250"," 30s and 20s right now and a lot of the market financials telling a different story right now"
"9268250","9274770"," financials telling you that the market is still strong right noticing that financials are not"
"9274770","9281490"," coming down too deep i've looked at financials over the weekend they're still kind of strong energy"
"9281490","9287570"," strong right now that's pointing towards the correction financials remaining strong even in this"
"9287570","9295090"," pullback is saying this is not the top right and you got communication services still kind of"
"9295090","9301530"," strong down here uh so we're we're pulling back that's all that's shown right now oil being strong"
"9301530","9311350"," is pointing towards the correction but one bit of concern i have here is PMO raise this"
"9311350","9319570"," up a little bit i never like to see PMO here's the zero line right here on PMO i never"
"9319570","9327130"," like to see that white cross below the red uh on PMO and we are crossing the white line is"
"9327130","9332690"," crossing the red line right now on PMO never a good sign it does usually point towards some kind of"
"9332690","9339090"," a pullback and i want to point your your eyes to right here on these pullbacks that have taken"
"9339090","9344850"," place and that we have that cross again so if we were to trade the zero line you're talking about"
"9344850","9352130"," price on spy eventually coming coming down in trade in that 432 430 and unless spy is able to"
"9352130","9359770"," regain above it's hourly trigger what is above right now but start closing those gaps to the upside"
"9359770","9365870"," we can't give it to the bulls same thing on PPO as well just want to direct your attention to"
"9365870","9370810"," this you've got a cross confirmed cross of the green below the purple line and that would want to"
"9370810","9377330"," trade right back down to that zero line as well on PPO so PPO PMO is saying expect the correction"
"9377330","9387310"," we're going to show you this next one right here take that one away so PPO"
"9387310","9396190"," PMO will not improve here they would improve if we begin to start to trade even higher if we begin"
"9396190","9401790"," to start returning to the scene of the crime so PPO and PPO improve yeah we can start to get"
"9401790","9409210"," bullish to get and say let's go higher let's go trade that 465 470 all those kind of targets right"
"9409210","9418370"," now though PMOP PPO is sending a warning shot across the bow of bulls saying to look for lower lows"
"9418370","9427610"," where do we sell up here we sell up here right around here 451 37 with stops above in case"
"9427610","9442590"," the bulls do make a comeback and start to turn the market around we're"
"9442590","9449310"," also going to take a look at sorry about that I'm having a pain in the ass today we're also"
"9449310","9459270"," going to take a look at spy on a daily chart and I use this for I use this"
"9459270","9468210"," for are we at a top or not or we just do for a correction so on the spy right"
"9468210","9477970"," now you're watching the daily cooling off here I want you to notice this here okay this cooling"
"9477970","9487810"," off of daily is cooling off of weekly we have one bad weekly bar here already showing us the"
"9487810","9496490"," way to a downside move to the 420 or four excuse me four four thirty four twenty four thirty but"
"9496490","9505050"," what is positive for bulls is we're not seeing the topping action yet in the monthly here so this"
"9505050","9512170"," one this is a key one right here we tend to top when we're at a top on weekly and"
"9512170","9516390"," monthly we're not there yet with the monthly the monthly is not showing us that we're topped out"
"9516390","9521450"," here yet so even if we do get this pull back here if this gets confirmed we start trading below"
"9521450","9527950"," the daily trigger I'm still going to expect this to get bought and for this this all-time high or"
"9527950","9534710"," a failure of all time high at that 470 and watching the rest of this blue block pick back up"
"9534710","9540230"," so though though we have some bad velocity and a weekly time frame and a daily time frame monthly"
"9540230","9548250"," time frame is intact for move higher and to that point here you're watching the monthly trigger"
"9548250","9554210"," just start cranking to the upside here so you're going to be watching major support just start"
"9554210","9558710"," ripping face up here so I don't think this market is over right now though a lot of people do"
"9558710","9564750"," think that we are at the top and that's it I don't so if you are a bull right now"
"9564750","9576750"," things out here if you"
"9576750","9582250"," are a bull right now there's nothing saying that we're done we're going to bring up two other"
"9582250","9587870"," things here as well this is the spy we could do SPX it doesn't really matter if it's by SPX"
"9587870","9594670"," but this is the fed funds rate starting to top off here right what kind of a time frame not"
"9594670","9600190"," quite flat yet but is starting to right you can start to see the fed's fun rate starting the top"
"9600190","9609750"," off here so we're getting close to the top of the market but we've seen the the rate of inflation"
"9609750","9615110"," is coming down still has a little bit more to go though right here doesn't it's got a little bit"
"9615110","9622930"," more to go here all this pointing towards not quite the top on rate hikes not quite the done with"
"9622930","9632090"," flattening of inflation you really are looking for like a flat on fed funds rate the the almost"
"9632090","9638590"," inflation bottoming and then the unemployment rate to start to rise we're not having quite seen"
"9638590","9645110"," that yet so this is showing that the run is likely not over even with the inverted yield curve"
"9645110","9651010"," coming up I'm going to expect that to roll over as well and then bump back up again once we"
"9651010","9656630"," come into September you should see a bump in September and then of January February somewhere in"
"9656630","9662330"," there you'll see us it start to scream so right now even these even these projections for on macro"
"9662330","9670930"," are saying that the run is not done to the upside so looking at all the big macro picture"
"9670930","9680920"," if you're looking at SPX you're looking for so here's SPX on"
"9680920","9687280"," an hourly something like this kind of a picture here we'll actually track this and see what this"
"9687280","9694160"," means but somewhere in here we're going to try to track something like this possible we go up there"
"9694160","9704140"," I doubt it though and you're going to see you know maybe into the 21st we get weak where"
"9704140","9713440"," is that 14th I'll leave it all the way out to there although I think it's sooner I think we"
"9713440","9719880"," trade this actually sooner than that we find our bottom we start working our way higher I'll give"
"9719880","9726540"," you all the way out to there for it but I think that's how it happens now there's your 444"
"9726540","9737290"," but it's actually 44438 somewhere down here now"
"9737290","9743130"," all that shit's going to get closed out right there so kind of weak right now I'm definitely not"
"9743130","9750270"," bullish on spy overall I'm bullish on spy overall like higher time frame stuff I'm bullish on spy"
"9750270","9762560"," nice little dip buy right there so"
"9762560","9768380"," what's my take on spy right my take on spy is yeah we can go up here no problem between"
"9768380","9773700"," now and Wednesday we could even return to the scene of the crime and roll it over and go down"
"9773700","9777880"," there believe it or not I don't know that we do as long as we stay above the hourly the"
"9777880","9784540"," one in the five we'll trade this up and we'll look for signposts so as we get up here like"
"9784540","9789720"," you'll take the money and run if it breaks above and holds and starts heading higher to close stuff"
"9789720","9796840"," out above we'll take that trade too but currently what the market looks like currently is it looks"
"9796840","9804480"," like a correction right look that's what it looks like so if you're a bull out there you can be"
"9804480","9813260"," bullish here to 451 37 somewhere in there unless it shows itself otherwise you'll tactfully take"
"9813260","9819340"," withdraw yourself in the market if we trade begin to trade above it and begin to attack those"
"9819340","9825100"," previous scene of the crimes we've got two of them we can trade those up as well and then if"
"9825100","9832140"," we come back down and confirm that the that puck that correct corrective behavior is over and you"
"9832140","9838180"," want to start trading 4,700 we'll take that trade as well right so bulls have to be tactful here"
"9838180","9844300"," bears are in charge here they are whether you like it or not they are and you're actually seeing it"
"9844300","9856340"," right now across the market there we go keep on squeezing baby yeah they"
"9856340","9861000"," are I think they're sitting comfortable drinking Zima right now I think they're waiting for I think"
"9861000","9866920"," not you know like maybe not you as a bear but I'm talking about a hedge fund they're a sell"
"9866920","9874360"," side hedge fund that's your sell right here okay not might not be yours your sell there might be a"
"9874360","9880360"," hedge fund out there that's short from right here but the big money sellers the big money your big"
"9880360","9889220"," money like your old Jim bros they're sitting up here that's where they are right now now they're"
"9889220","9893840"," going to try to sell you down on 451 37 or enter around there I assure you that's where they"
"9893840","9903640"," are now they're going to try to step in now inflation"
"9903640","9912320"," PC PCI CPI it's not always a straight line down normally when we get a big role in inflation"
"9912320","9919100"," historically you will get one or two bad reports for bulls does this all setting up for that they"
"9919100","9928140"," already know those numbers in advance probably likely so I guess the question becomes are we"
"9928140","9933100"," setting up for that for those bad numbers later in the week looking for a nice place to sell this"
"9933100","9938200"," market so if you're a bear you have if you're a seller right if you're a bear you have your"
"9938200","9947300"," first first place to sell right here right good job 450 right your second place to sell is 451 39"

"10211030","10216890"," financials are not saying that we're risk off right now so it's good to see that they're relatively"
"10217450","10224590"," strong even though we have some rotation going on in the marketplace right now so i'm not seeing"

"15897450","15902810"," actually have an opportunity to trade higher than that so unlike uh the last ticker that we"
"15902810","15913830"," reviewed PLTR this one here has uh more upside potential so if lucid comes out strong 781"
"15913830","15932720"," price target 552 to the downside i'm"
"15932720","15938740"," fascinated on this one even more so than PLTR uh for two reasons as a matter of fact my daughter's"

"15993980","16000560"," can grab this uh this weekly down here so hopefully we get a bad report on lucid it would make"
"16000560","16006700"," a prime candidate for a call spread that's three months out so if you are one of those people that"
"16006700","16012600"," like hey i hate risk keep lucid on your radar in case it does go down even just to own"
