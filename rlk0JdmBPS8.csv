"4880","6360"," Check Part 2, Mike Jack."
"7620","9020"," What's going on out there?"
"14040","15320"," Good morning, Chris."
"15560","16820"," I can't believe I can't get back like that. "
"22420","23640"," That is from Jared."
"24340","24680"," Good morning."
"33200","43080"," Gotta be like that springtime thing or something where they try to make babies or"
"43080","43900"," something like men. "
"48960","70480"," What's going"
"70480","71800"," on out there?"
"71960","72360"," Good morning."
"75400","77120"," You see that nice bounce?"
"78580","81540"," You see that nice bounce out there this morning?"
"82520","84280"," Did you get your market free?"
"84460","86880"," You see that bounce off the early trade this morning?"
"88040","91100"," Lasting off the trade, 2017-29."
"91420","93280"," Trying to get up to $5.40, baby. "
"96400","97620"," Oh, yeah."
"99340","104780"," I'm gonna late this morning."
"104920","105980"," I'm running a little bit late here. "
"106500","109120"," I don't know if I should do the market brief or go straight to the charts."
"109800","117820"," If you are a supporter or a pro trainer, you should have seen the market update on the website."
"119140","127740"," And we are trading our first target currently right now at $5.17.12. In that note that I posted"
"127740","136440"," last night for you, we would like to see another push higher to, I believe, $5.20. As a matter"
"136440","138220"," of fact, we'll take a look really quick. "
"138660","139540"," I'm just gonna pull this down."
"140800","143980"," You want to keep your eyes on two things today, okay?"
"145040","147760"," The first thing is going to be $5,200."
"149500","153660"," So I want you to, if you're at home or in your office, wherever you are, okay, listen closely. "
"155160","161200"," Your target above is, if you didn't receive the note, didn't read the note, not a subscriber, not a"
"161200","161600"," pro trader."
"162680","166340"," I want you to, I want to draw your attention at home, I want you to draw a line or"
"166340","169760"," a box on 5,200 of SPX, okay?"
"170740","176540"," So 52, whoa, 5,200 of SPX has kind of a resistance area."
"176540","178680"," You see that yesterday's $178 million. "
"178820","179240"," I don't know what it is."
"179300","180600"," It's more like I got to update it with you guys."
"181180","183880"," About 5,200, you're looking for that one right there, okay?"
"184920","187020"," As a target for today, if possible. "
"187780","194520"," Now we just broke above 51.75. So just keep your eyes on that 51.75 as a place of"
"194520","194880"," support."
"195840","201200"," As long as we can consolidate here, that's your attack to the upside is 5,200, okay?"
"201820","202960"," And we need to hold this today."
"203120","209280"," This morning, we need to hold 51.75. So we can attack that 5,200 to the upside. "
"209660","211700"," That's a pretty big wall up there to get through."
"213540","217840"," Now, this morning's print non-farm payroll helps."
"218420","219240"," What's going on this morning?"
"219340","220020"," What's happening over here?"
"220100","221040"," We got some weirdness going on. "
"222680","224060"," Am I losing the stream already?"
"224300","224600"," I don't know."
"225400","225760"," I hope I'm not."
"227520","229320"," Hold on, one quick second here. "
"230860","231620"," Oh, there we go."
"231720","233460"," That was just some red doom color."
"234840","239140"," But just as the heads up here, that's the attack to the upside is 5,200. "
"239940","247640"," The print that came in this morning is good for bulls to have that continuation."
"247960","256040"," If the news matters at all, it looks like they're doing their job or the fed has been doing their"
"256040","256380"," job."
"256540","259800"," Now, I know that you guys are going to say that the numbers are fake and all that kind of"
"259800","263120"," stuff, but it doesn't lend itself to the conversation. "
"265600","270660"," It does not that the print this morning does not lend itself to the conversation that the fed needs"
"270660","272460"," to do higher for longer."
"273140","276880"," That should propel markets to that 520."
"277920","280240"," Or possibly today, at least give the fuel. "
"280340","285460"," It's not at least isn't bad for the markets in the short term."
"285460","289700"," Now, in the long term, that's a different discussion."
"290700","293220"," Our rate cuts good or bad for the market. "
"293840","295200"," That's a whole other discussion."
"296140","304900"," And that also the rate of inflation, the speed at which it goes down goes up matters the speed of"
"304900","308500"," unemployment in jobs, whether it goes up or down that matters as well."
"309060","319240"," Now, there are historical times where they can cut slightly like a cut that no cut, as"
"319240","322320"," long as they're telling you like we're only getting one, we're only going to split them up. "
"323040","329080"," And if you see, as long as you see those numbers just like float sideways and down and sideways and"
"329080","332320"," up slightly for unemployment, I'm talking about inflation here, every year."
"332320","339420"," But so far right now, I would say you're kind of safe at the moment, if you're a bull."
"340340","345880"," And even the words that Jerome uses with, I don't expect two rate cuts in a row. "
"347000","351500"," Remember yesterday, the day before Jerome was saying, we're going to switch over here."
"351620","352820"," I'll get you on the charts really quick."
"353040","353740"," Just got out of here for a minute. "
"353860","354540"," We'll come back to this."
"356600","358800"," So I want to talk to you guys about something from yesterday."
"359640","361640"," We'll come back to this over here in just a moment. "
"365160","372920"," There were a couple key phrases from Jerome Powell's testimony that's caught by attention."
"374660","379540"," The first one was, let me give you guys some targets up here."
"379680","382800"," Hold on, hold on, I'll get you guys some targets right here so you don't feel like you're naked. "
"384560","385960"," There we go, nice and easy."
"386760","388240"," No, easy, that is right there."
"390600","393600"," So just broke above R1 at 5, 17, 20. "
"394120","398000"," We are about to get, we're attacking now 5, 19, 59."
"400080","401240"," That's your R2."
"402380","403940"," And we are blasting, baby. "
"405240","411100"," So there were two key statements from Jerome Powell that I want to draw your attention to."
"411560","413420"," There's something else I want to tell you here, okay?"
"414760","416240"," As we go up here, right?"
"418440","421260"," If we hit those targets, it is a Friday."
"422300","425600"," Do you guys know who a dray to the moon, bass basses?"
"425960","427940"," He made a really cool post last night. "
"428520","430100"," And I always like when he makes this post."
"431200","437720"," The post that he made was about an hour after non-farms or most data on Fridays."
"438860","442320"," The run is over, whether it's going down or up, doesn't matter. "
"442960","448480"," And what it is is traders take the money, run, and wrap up for the weekend."
"449260","449920"," Does that make sense?"
"451220","454120"," So I want you to be aware of that this morning as well."
"454320","461860"," If we blast up there, hit 520, hit 5, 200, and this is the last line you want to be"
"461860","464560"," snapping on your charts at home is NVDA. "
"464560","467840"," If they hit 1,000, there's like a little symphony going on."
"468380","474240"," It would not shock me to see traders take their profit and their money, say have a great weekend,"
"474680","476060"," and I'll see you on Monday."
"476340","478380"," So don't get caught in that if it happens, okay?"
"478720","480200"," Don't be like, why are we not going up anymore?"
"480920","484300"," It's because people are taking the money and going to have a great weekend with their friends and"
"484300","485040"," their family and stuff. "
"485820","487480"," Now, back to the Jerome thing."
"487960","489240"," Two things caught my interest."
"489240","494460"," In one of them, he's been saying, and I haven't been listening closely enough. "
"494640","504380"," Now, the first one is he specifically mentioned that a lot of market participants or"
"504380","505640"," some, I don't think he said a lot."
"505700","515380"," I think he said some market participants are not prepared for the impact"
"515380","519059"," of this last rate cycle."
"519059","520280"," And it's results. "
"521720","528760"," And he was, it wasn't in a negative light because he also mentioned that he was no longer"
"528760","529080"," adversarial."
"529880","530600"," He said that too."
"531340","541020"," He said, we are no longer adversarial and we are, we are like, we're telegraphing to"
"541020","546240"," market participants, unlike in past years, right?"
"548220","554900"," So what I took from that was, you know, don't be expecting crashes once we start cutting rates. "
"555420","558540"," But here's the other key part that he's been mentioning."
"558820","559060"," Hi, Kitty."
"559340","559780"," Good morning. "
"560180","561560"," Happy, happy spring, Kitty."
"562020","562980"," I do think you're beautiful."
"563780","564900"," But here's the other key part. "
"566020","567840"," He keeps harping on this."
"568240","571740"," You're not going to get back to back rate cuts."
"572580","578340"," He is also telegraphing to you that because you're not getting back to back rate cuts. "
"578820","580720"," It's because they have not broken anything."
"581260","582400"," There's no need to."
"583020","590240"," We have historical examples of the fed cutting rates, then raising them again, then cutting them,"
"590540","595740"," but not like, whenever we get like, rate cut, rate cut, rate cut, rate cut down to zero. "
"596440","598220"," It's usually because we've broken something."
"599140","605640"," If he's, whether this is real or not, if he's telegraphing to you, don't expect, you know, like,"
"605900","607560"," cut, cut, cut all in a row."
"608100","611000"," Now we might give you one, then we'll, we'll be data dependent. "
"611280","614200"," So we're not going to, we're likely not going to cut the next decision."
"614660","618480"," We might cut it in another, you know, two or three decisions down the road or one down the road."
"619480","624640"," What he's telling you is that these rate cuts are not because they broke something. "
"625060","631760"," Now, if you look back in the 90s, there was a period of, of the fed cutting rates, raising rates,"
"631920","634360"," cutting rates, raising rates, like bouncing back and forth."
"635440","643640"," And I think that's what he's trying to telegraph to you is he might, he might like come off from"
"643640","645240"," underneath and get that soft landing."
"645500","646580"," Now, saying that. "
"647760","648980"," All right, Katie, we're done."
"650120","651300"," Put them on the floor."
"652840","654280"," Now saying that. "
"655420","658560"," I want to make one more or one other thing clear to you."
"660580","664400"," That's off landing probably began last year."
"666080","669680"," Now, you see, you have a time period of the soft landing, right?"
"670260","671660"," It's not like we're getting it later. "
"671940","673060"," It's already started."
"673840","675820"," We're in the soft landing."
"676600","677800"," Then there's a window. "
"678560","680000"," So you can actually look up."
"680140","681640"," I'll show, I'll show the stuff to you guys."
"681840","685180"," I haven't posted on the website, but it's private right now. "
"686440","689760"," But so, so there's a defined period of the soft landing."
"689940","690060"," Okay."
"691800","692980"," Historically, you can go back. "
"693160","696700"," You can go on the internet and look and they'll tell you this is what the period of the soft"
"696700","697140"," landing."
"698180","707540"," That is a 100% of the time followed by a recession, a hard landing."
"708320","711380"," Now, that time period is defined as well. "
"712280","720200"," But in between the two of them, the two or two declared soft landings and recessions, there's also"
"720200","721520"," a window in between that."
"722300","723920"," And that's the key one right there."
"724420","726600"," When we get a soft landing, there's a window. "
"726800","733700"," And that window can range anywhere from one and a half to three years to sometimes five to ten"
"733700","734000"," years."
"734920","739600"," And this is where the, this is where the manipulation comes in from the Fed, from the Treasury"
"739600","740060"," Department."
"741340","745020"," Also, economic conditions, conditions, normal conditions. "
"745740","746200"," Who's president?"
"746440","747040"," What the tax is like?"
"747180","748800"," We're in a war, not in a war, that kind of stuff."
"748800","755340"," So I want to preface this by saying that he's attempting, well, number one, he's been successful"
"755340","756960"," with getting us a soft landing."
"757620","759740"," Whether you like that or not, that's what he's done. "
"760620","764620"," He's then going to shift though into this, this window."
"765940","771360"," Because no matter what, historically, we always, after that soft landing, we get the recession."
"772480","777380"," Now, I don't know what that time period is going to be in this cycle. "
"777940","781300"," But we have wide ranges of that window."
"781660","784080"," I will try to pull that chart up for you this morning."
"784300","789600"," I have it on our website, but it's been kept private for some time. "
"789740","791180"," And I'll show it to you guys this morning."
"793740","798820"," The soft landings, the recessionary periods, and the windows that nobody talks about."
"799280","801580"," Nobody ever talks about the window between that. "
"801780","802640"," There's this buffer zone."
"804140","805880"," My cat is now destroyed."
"806480","809340"," My cat is now destroying stuff in my office. "
"810500","811140"," Springtime."
"811480","812680"," Springtime for kitties."
"815320","822800"," Spoons now trading $5.17.98. Oh, yeah, we're melting up. "
"824580","826040"," We're blasting here."
"828340","829180"," Cues right now."
"829280","830420"," Let's check on the cues really quick. "
"831100","834100"," Cues coming up into R1 resistance right now."
"834220","837400"," So watch out for a roll briefly in S&P 500."
"838020","842760"," You've got R1 at 447.83 on the cues. "
"843660","845320"," Next target for the cues."
"845540","849400"," Nor that is 450.20, baby."
"850180","853320"," 450.20. R2 on the cues today. "
"854180","863720"," 450.20. R2 on spy 5.19.59. R3 on spy"
"863720","867360"," 5.23. 28."
"870260","871760"," So excited right now."
"872440","876360"," Oh, and I looked up my, I didn't, I thought I had a March 18 calls. "
"876780","879020"," I have March 28 calls for a Tesla."
"879640","881640"," So I've got some time on my calls here."
"881800","882900"," Now I'm still fucked up. "
"882900","891240"," I'm down $3 on some calls for Tesla, but I'm going to hold on to them."
"892160","893640"," And I'm not going to mess with them."
"893740","895040"," So I'm just going to leave those things on. "
"898020","899760"," I'm just going to leave them out and see what happens."
"901680","904420"," You're adding puts Jimmy this morning from March 28th."
"904900","907720"," Yeah, I've got a put spread for March 28th. "
"907720","911920"," I need the market to, well, you know, we're going to look at something this morning."
"911920","913880"," Let me see if I can bring this up for you guys this morning."
"915080","917480"," You guys want to see what's ahead for us?"
"918420","920220"," What do you want to just draw it out for you really quick?"
"923320","924620"," You just do it by hand. "
"925160","926940"," You want to say fuck it, we'll do it live."
"928080","931280"," Like that got that old guy from Fox News or whatever back in the day."
"932240","933340"," Let's take a look at a spoon. "
"933560","934620"," Let's see what the cues together."
"936520","939720"," Here, let's know you can do this."
"939860","940400"," We'll do it this way. "
"942460","943500"," Trigger screen, right?"
"944340","945060"," Let's do it this way."
"947920","950360"," I wanted to post this on Twitter last night."
"951460","951800"," Kitty. "
"952480","953620"," Kitty, now you're almost kidding."
"954280","954620"," What are you doing?"
"955880","956880"," I love you too, Kitty."
"957460","959020"," I know, Kitty. "
"959740","961020"," I know you're hot sauce right now."
"962440","964540"," You're very hot sauce right now, I can tell."
"966600","968440"," This cat, she just attacked me. "
"969620","971000"," All right, cues, right?"
"971900","972360"," Kitty."
"973180","973540"," Kitty."
"975200","976620"," She's really frisky right now. "
"977780","979480"," You see this right here?"
"979660","982580"," This is your, this is your, let me get rid of this."
"984000","984700"," Hi, Kitty."
"986560","991820"," This is the, as a matter of fact, this is what you were given last night in the market's brief. "
"992860","994780"," A projection of us coming up here."
"995620","997300"," And this is your first target right here."
"997340","998080"," This is cues target. "
"998780","1001560"," So if you read the market brief, this is what you got last night."
"1002560","1007300"," And you can see we're coming into, we're coming into that first resistance point up here, right?"
"1007460","1009580"," I got a target up here of 448-17."
"1011160","1012660"," We're right about there right now. "
"1013480","1013920"," Kitty."
"1014640","1015060"," Kitty."
"1016580","1022180"," Well, this cat is, this cat wants something, not me. "
"1022660","1023780"," I don't know what she wants."
"1025380","1028720"," We're going to look at something here that we're going to go to a daily chart here, okay?"
"1032079","1037819"," And I want to show you what is actually expected, okay?"
"1039500","1041099"," It's an important thing for you."
"1041119","1043579"," If you're a trainer, you're an investor, okay?"
"1043700","1045780"," I want to show you what is actually expected here. "
"1049000","1053480"," And you're going to see, or you're likely, I'm going to say, things can change."
"1054340","1062240"," They can change, but if they don't change, I'm going to show exactly what you're going to expect."
"1065400","1067420"," Let's make that a solid line. "
"1067540","1071160"," We don't like, I don't know if we do the dots or not, but I kind of like these dots,"
"1071320","1072580"," but we're going to make it solid."
"1076200","1080420"," You're going to expect like something like this, okay?"
"1082800","1083860"," Is that, what is that, July?"
"1084180","1085120"," That's a little too far."
"1086480","1087640"," January, right there. "
"1095660","1097020"," Something like this, okay?"
"1097280","1099360"," I'm kind of like being sloppy with this right now."
"1099880","1100800"," Maybe I should do it with spy."
"1102000","1103480"," But any, you get the points here, okay?"
"1104040","1107860"," I think that's five, I think it's five, uh, five hundred is the projection over there. "
"1109580","1111900"," This is basically what you're going to expect to happen."
"1112760","1113480"," No, kitty?"
"1114240","1116820"," Okay, so my point here is this."
"1117280","1123600"," See how you have this nice clean bottom, nice easy run, pull back, bam, right?"
"1123980","1124640"," Nice easy run. "
"1126180","1134740"," As we get late cycle of this bull run, okay, we're going to become a lot more volatile"
"1134740","1137800"," in this late cycle."
"1140820","1144420"," You're going to see price begin to do stuff like this."
"1144860","1153900"," So I would say to you that as we become late cycle bull run, this isn't bearish, is it?"
"1154640","1162000"," None of that's bearish, but it does introduce, uh, it does introduce volatility into the market. "
"1162660","1165560"," And this is bullish volatility, right?"
"1165560","1170420"," You see, we start to have like, people like to call this what, like an expanding, uh, megaphone or"
"1170420","1170720"," something."
"1171280","1171820"," I'm joking."
"1173120","1174440"," But do you know what I'm saying?"
"1174620","1180300"," So you're going to get those all time highs up around, uh, five, or five fifty six, six thousand. "
"1181740","1182900"," On spoons, right?"
"1184160","1187840"," But at the same time, it's going to be violent as we make our way up there too."
"1189080","1190720"," So put that on your plate."
"1192060","1194220"," Or have that on your plate as we move forward. "
"1194220","1196260"," No, I want you to know that."
"1196460","1198000"," Yeah, you're going to get your all time."
"1198140","1200440"," You're going to get six thousand on spoons. "
"1200820","1204640"," But for us to get there, right, is not going to be an easy ride."
"1205640","1210320"," It's going to be something where we're like expanding volatility at the same time, getting up to"
"1210320","1213660"," those highs and those, those, those really big numbers."
"1214400","1221400"," But the market is projected to do into, uh, into late this year and possibly even into the spring. "
"1222320","1224100"," Does that make sense to you guys out there?"
"1224220","1229660"," Please tell me in the chat if you can at least grasp that concept because, uh, I think that."
"1230880","1234400"," You'll see a resurgence of look at that."
"1234760","1236000"," Look at that gorgeous. "
"1236880","1237360"," Yeah."
"1239660","1240100"," I know."
"1240280","1240320"," Kitty. "
"1241380","1241940"," I see Kitty."
"1242360","1242840"," Don't do it."
"1242920","1243060"," Kitty. "
"1245240","1246460"," Oh, she's frisky."
"1248800","1252440"," I'm being attacked right like literally physically attacked right now by a cat."
"1257340","1258100"," Hi, Kitty. "
"1258480","1260260"," I need your head scratched for you."
"1260380","1261140"," I need to be told you love."
"1264000","1266760"," So just in your mind. "
"1268200","1272360"," In your mind start to think about, uh, range expansion."
"1273360","1273860"," Right."
"1274080","1274100"," Right. "
"1274100","1274160"," Right."
"1274240","1274320"," Right."
"1274320","1274880"," This down at home. "
"1275960","1278540"," That's telling me to expect range expansion."
"1279460","1284580"," Uh, and I would call it upside volatility here."
"1285240","1285940"," There she is. "
"1286060","1286980"," Look at that."
"1286980","1287280"," That's her."
"1287460","1287960"," Can you see her?"
"1288140","1288380"," Look at this. "
"1288440","1288840"," Look at this cat."
"1293320","1294460"," What are you doing?"
"1295840","1296080"," What?"
"1296240","1296480"," I don't want."
"1296720","1297640"," Why are you looking at my face?"
"1299000","1299060"," No. "
"1299260","1299420"," No."
"1300260","1300460"," No."
"1301160","1301820"," No, Kitty. "
"1303280","1304240"," This is seriously."
"1305540","1306460"," Leave me alone."
"1309380","1311840"," This is unwanted sexual contacts, Kitty. "
"1314580","1316660"," Unwanted sexual contact, Kitty."
"1320760","1321360"," Kitty."
"1322620","1324500"," I really am being attacked right now. "
"1324720","1326080"," This cat will not leave me alone."
"1333540","1334360"," So."
"1335640","1339320"," So with that expected volatility, right, in the market. "
"1340480","1344100"," That's going to bring a lot of."
"1346520","1348820"," Louder calls for a crash."
"1349280","1352080"," And as we get that expand that range expansion. "
"1353480","1355120"," Bears will eat, which is great."
"1355680","1356440"," You're a seller."
"1357120","1360000"," There's an expectation here as we make our way up. "
"1360540","1362460"," That you're going to get some fat prints."
"1363140","1363900"," Like really fat."
"1364300","1366020"," You're going to see bears eating. "
"1366520","1367360"," You guys are here."
"1367520","1368740"," This bears eat bull's eat."
"1369940","1372600"," That's an expectation to happen and come down the road. "
"1373320","1374480"," But you are also."
"1374940","1376800"," I want you to be very clear on this."
"1376940","1377120"," Okay. "
"1378480","1379600"," I want to be very clear on this."
"1379600","1379840"," Okay."
"1380140","1382960"," As we go into this late market bull run. "
"1384640","1386840"," I want you to think about."
"1387240","1388100"," I want you to look at."
"1388220","1388560"," I want you to. "
"1388740","1391980"," You know, I don't know why horse lover fat is no longer on Twitter."
"1392180","1393040"," I don't know what happened."
"1393560","1394480"," I don't know why. "
"1394700","1395520"," I don't care either."
"1396220","1397760"," I know him as a trader."
"1398580","1399740"," On a personal level. "
"1400180","1402640"," And I used to trade with him back in the day."
"1403600","1406920"," And he used to give me some very sage advice."
"1407900","1409220"," Very sage advice. "
"1409300","1409780"," Okay."
"1410480","1412780"," But this has to do with bull runs."
"1413480","1415580"," You have the easy bull run. "
"1415780","1416000"," Okay."
"1416320","1418260"," See if like the easy portion of a bull run."
"1418600","1419580"," You're in a bull run. "
"1419700","1420260"," Everything is awesome."
"1420500","1420660"," Sauce."
"1421800","1422760"," Markets cranking. "
"1423060","1423140"," Right."
"1423520","1424500"," Everybody's like yeah, bro."
"1424680","1426080"," I'm making money on this ticker. "
"1426620","1428800"," All these AI stocks are awesome."
"1428960","1430040"," Doesn't matter what you buy bro."
"1430160","1430760"," It's just whoo. "
"1430900","1431700"," Everything's going awesome."
"1433720","1434200"," Right."
"1435300","1436840"," Well, in the late stage. "
"1438420","1443380"," Any of the any of those like shit coz and shit stocks that fired off."
"1444580","1446160"," They get de leveraged."
"1446680","1450360"," Now your big ones, the real AI stocks continue higher. "
"1450960","1452980"," But your shit coz don't."
"1454460","1457420"," And in that process too, right."
"1458080","1461680"," All of your people that made money in faux mode and made bank. "
"1461680","1463840"," All your all your kick ass traders."
"1464020","1465440"," You're like that guy over there."
"1465560","1467300"," He's been long in VDA since the beginning. "
"1467920","1469520"," He's made tons of money."
"1470700","1473920"," They start to get washed out of the market first."
"1474840","1476580"," So I want you to be aware of that. "
"1477540","1480580"," That there's a start of washing out."
"1481840","1482960"," Young traders."
"1484300","1488100"," That are not prepared for that volatility expansion. "
"1488640","1492480"," Even though we're going to all or to like six thousand on spy."
"1493320","1494620"," You get what I'm saying here."
"1496000","1497300"," That's not started yet. "
"1497520","1498320"," We're not there yet."
"1498980","1501500"," We're likely going to hit above five fifty."
"1502560","1506080"," On spy and then you're going to start to see that volatility. "
"1506560","1508940"," Enter the markets as we begin to run up."
"1509440","1511300"," Into that six thousand number."
"1512260","1514280"," But I want you to be prepared for it. "
"1514280","1515940"," If you're a part of our community."
"1516280","1521180"," I need you to know that things are going to get wild as we go there."
"1521940","1525840"," If you're a bear, you're going to begin to be able to make a lot of money. "
"1526500","1528220"," But you can't get too bearish."
"1529340","1530380"," So you're going to get paid."
"1531280","1534460"," Like great traders, bulls bears, they're going to get paid. "
"1535860","1538760"," This new young generation of faux mobiles."
"1539460","1541100"," A lot of them will get washed out."
"1541100","1544060"," Because they're going to expect things to just go straight up. "
"1544400","1545060"," All of it."
"1545480","1547500"," Doesn't matter what I bought calls, they're just going to print."
"1548060","1549300"," That will not be the case. "
"1550520","1554560"," And you will likely need to switch from individual tickers."
"1555380","1556420"," To the big boys."
"1557260","1558720"," I know you're like you're like a cupboard. "
"1558740","1559640"," You did that with mag seven."
"1559780","1562280"," But you're likely going to have to switch to like the indexes."
"1563040","1566900"," You're likely going to have to switch to some kind of like safety as this happens. "
"1567860","1568600"," Does that make sense?"
"1568820","1570240"," I hope that makes sense to you guys out there."
"1571140","1574440"," And I'm saying this too, because horse lover fat."
"1576120","1579100"," Taught me how to do this very well. "
"1579860","1582280"," And I got to give him that respect as a trader."
"1583140","1585040"," He spent a lot of time with me."
"1585640","1590800"," Making sure that I was able to make those adjustments and be quite successful. "
"1591480","1595140"," So if you guys know where he is out there, you tell him I said hello and thank you very"
"1595140","1595540"," much."
"1600540","1601340"," All right."
"1601520","1601920"," Cool, cool, cool. "
"1606680","1607480"," Fair podcast."
"1607740","1608700"," What's going on out there brother?"
"1609300","1612640"," Good to see you, my man."
"1615980","1618220"," We have to take the gamma for you this morning. "
"1618480","1619300"," I'll give you two seconds here."
"1619400","1620260"," I got the gamma rolling here."
"1621580","1622860"," Let me kick the machine this morning. "
"1629520","1630500"," Range expansion."
"1633680","1635660"," Range expansion, baby."
"1639380","1640680"," Let's see if I can get this. "
"1640900","1641620"," Hold on here."
"1642700","1643560"," There we go."
"1643580","1644580"," We'll grab that right there. "
"1645740","1647380"," Pump this bad boy in."
"1647820","1648080"," All right."
"1648280","1649160"," Get the machine running. "
"1649720","1658950"," Oh, there we go."
"1659110","1659850"," Ooh, look at that."
"1660910","1662550"," Let's check this out down here. "
"1663550","1664690"," Look at this together here."
"1666050","1667310"," Look what's happening here."
"1669170","1670490"," Hold on a second here. "
"1671170","1672690"," Let's see what's happening this morning."
"1673830","1676270"," This is going to be a little shocking to some of you out there."
"1676430","1678330"," A lot of you are going to be like, what is going on?"
"1683370","1685210"," What is happening right now?"
"1688910","1692710"," They're trying to build traitors. "
"1693630","1697110"," It's beginning to, or attempting right now."
"1700050","1701470"," Look at this down here."
"1701770","1702350"," Twenty two million. "
"1702610","1703550"," Fifty one eighty five."
"1704170","1705310"," Fifty one eighty."
"1706330","1707650"," Fifty one seventy five. "
"1707930","1708530"," Fifty one seventy."
"1709430","1711050"," You see that down there?"
"1711270","1712990"," This is local resistance right here."
"1713070","1715390"," Now two hundred and forty one million. "
"1716070","1717770"," This is more than yesterday, right?"
"1718530","1720930"," You've got people up here, right?"
"1721230","1721950"," They're like, yeah, man."
"1722050","1723430"," We're going to fifty two hundred."
"1724950","1727810"," This is starting to become stronger and stronger, right?"
"1727950","1728790"," This fifty two hundred. "
"1729310","1731230"," But then also look what's happening down here."
"1733230","1735530"," We just look at that development down here, right?"
"1735530","1739830"," Twenty two million, twenty nine million, seventy million, thirty six million, right?"
"1742950","1751310"," So they're trying here to form this support for us to trade that fifty two hundred."
"1751830","1754350"," Let's look higher right now, see if there's anything else developing. "
"1755550","1756650"," And look at what we see this morning."
"1757430","1761470"," Fifty two twenty five."
"1762910","1764890"," Fifty two fifty. "
"1765930","1766990"," Crazy, right?"
"1768030","1771350"," None of this game up here mattered until this morning."
"1771630","1775490"," We had fifty two hundred develop with this one develop earlier in the week."
"1775490","1776970"," And now it's huge. "
"1777730","1778330"," And look at this."
"1778430","1780150"," These higher levels now."
"1780570","1784250"," We now have fifty fifty two fifty to the upside developing. "
"1784890","1787330"," I mean, just check that bad boy out right there."
"1787450","1788910"," That was a gorgeous thing right there."
"1789830","1793190"," The gamma flip is now down below at five ten. "
"1794350","1795290"," Five ten."
"1795810","1797690"," Local support is now higher."
"1800840","1803180"," All the way up here. "
"1803340","1805380"," That doesn't mean it holds, but that's where it is now."
"1806280","1808960"," Gamma flip all the way down to fifty one hundred."
"1809200","1811000"," Giant air gap though, right here. "
"1811680","1813060"," So be aware of this too."
"1813060","1815460"," So if we do get any kind of corrective behavior."
"1816700","1819160"," We have this entire air gap to close. "
"1819780","1823740"," We could literally come all the way down here close all this back up."
"1824340","1826020"," And then go straight back up again."
"1826160","1826360"," Okay. "
"1826780","1828120"," And still be in what?"
"1828840","1829260"," Positive gamma."
"1830060","1832300"," So that's key to note as well, right?"
"1833280","1834820"," Take a look at that more closely here."
"1836780","1838920"," And where is real support?"
"1840260","1842060"," Take a look and find out where that is. "
"1842840","1845240"," Way, way down here."
"1846080","1847140"," Forty nine hundred."
"1847260","1852320"," Matter of fact, this probably has raised to five thousand, but we'll snap two lines down there. "
"1857380","1860360"," And what has the market done at this point?"
"1864900","1866820"," Leave these two right down here."
"1866940","1867320"," You see that?"
"1867520","1869260"," And you see this nice air gap down here?"
"1872580","1874980"," We could go all the way down here."
"1875980","1876340"," Right?"
"1877260","1877940"," Still positive gamma. "
"1878560","1882440"," Close all that still positive gamma, right?"
"1882980","1885380"," We could blast down here, close all that stuff up."
"1887440","1890700"," Still not confirm negative gamma."
"1894710","1897210"," There's no confirmation that we're negative, right?"
"1897850","1899950"," We have to come down and then reject it. "
"1902310","1905730"," But if we don't reject it, we come right back up here."
"1906570","1907630"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1907830","1910490"," Park our butts here and start heading higher again."
"1911790","1913410"," How does that translate?"
"1915230","1917050"," How does that translate to?"
"1920460","1921750"," Go to spy really quick. "
"1927860","1930120"," How does that translator look for?"
"1930540","1940240"," If you've ever seen, if you've ever seen a wack off, wack off distribution model, right?"
"1940680","1942320"," You guys haven't seen those."
"1942500","1943560"," You can Google search them."
"1944260","1946640"," That means that you've got this here, right?"
"1948880","1949620"," Whips up. "
"1950760","1952020"," Here's your trough."
"1959320","1962300"," And what bears wanted here was what?"
"1963140","1964860"," They wanted the failure, right?"
"1964860","1968400"," They wanted to come up here and fail."
"1970360","1971360"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"1971500","1976040"," If you know wack off models, you'll already know that we'd see a new low down here. "
"1977020","1978780"," But they didn't get that, did they?"
"1979600","1980540"," They didn't get it."
"1981540","1988320"," So because they didn't get it, and you can even see how the gamma is set up now at the"
"1988320","1989040"," gamma."
"1992280","1999700"," And where price is, no, no, no, no. "
"1999700","2001340"," I don't want to do web paint extension tool."
"2002340","2011220"," How we're set up right now is whatever this is, even if we come back down, there's your range"
"2011220","2012100"," expansion, right?"
"2013520","2014560"," You see it now?"
"2016060","2016960"," We go higher."
"2018920","2020860"," We get that 6,000 up there. "
"2020860","2021440"," Do you see that?"
"2022400","2023520"," This is gone."
"2024780","2027140"," Never ever come back again."
"2029100","2038910"," Your bear that said he was going to wait because we're coming back down here is"
"2038910","2039450"," sad. "
"2043150","2046990"," He said we were coming back down and he was going to get a chance to buy this down here"
"2046990","2047250"," again."
"2047909","2053750"," That is not like, or there's a high probability of that never happening."
"2054590","2057310"," Then we have some major support down here now. "
"2058570","2060949"," This is likely your bottom right here."
"2065020","2070060"," Never to be seen again, or at least for another year or two as we head that way."
"2070520","2072639"," See you later, 3,500. "
"2084150","2085130"," They did it."
"2087650","2089070"," They've pretty much done it."
"2092510","2093929"," It's kind of wild, isn't it?"
"2095250","2096530"," It's kind of wild, right?"
"2098990","2107300"," Then go down there, clear all those gaps out, start that nice expansion trade. "
"2114250","2117570"," There's got to be some pissed off people seeing that stuff out there."
"2117570","2117890"," I don't know."
"2117950","2126910"," You might not be pissed, but I'm sure that this development is going to make some people rage out"
"2126910","2127190"," there. "
"2130530","2133650"," I don't know how Tesla's doing."
"2133730","2134350"," I've got calls."
"2135050","2135890"," I have calls. "
"2136310","2137050"," I've been asking that a lot."
"2138270","2139210"," Look at the juice box."
"2139830","2142470"," I'm getting, like, people are like ripping on me. "
"2142790","2144150"," How's Tesla doing?"
"2145330","2147190"," You guys want to see how Tesla's doing?"
"2148090","2148970"," All right, we'll do Tesla."
"2149210","2149770"," You guys want to do Tesla?"
"2151210","2152250"," All right, we'll do Tesla."
"2156090","2160510"," If you're a pro trader out there, you already know how Tesla's expected to trade, right?"
"2164850","2166310"," You guys want me to draw it out for you?"
"2167310","2168370"," I'll draw it out for you. "
"2172430","2174810"," Let's see, we're going to bring up Tesla, right?"
"2182230","2183070"," Let's look at Tesla."
"2183350","2183590"," Are you ready?"
"2186610","2187050"," Fine."
"2187290","2188610"," We'll do Tesla, put the juice box. "
"2192970","2195770"," I got like Tesla, Jess is yelling at me."
"2197230","2200270"," I got like all the whole gang is yelling at me."
"2200330","2201670"," They're like, they're all over me on Twitter. "
"2203590","2207430"," I've been, like, intentionally not saying anything to them, not liking their posts and stuff."
"2207790","2208970"," I love these guys, by the way."
"2209850","2211870"," They're just like, I'm going to, like, leave them on the edge. "
"2213070","2214030"," Just edge them out a little bit."
"2219620","2220440"," Hold on, we'll do it."
"2220500","2221280"," We'll do a Tesla. "
"2222560","2222920"," Tesla."
"2226580","2227700"," No drawings on this chart."
"2227860","2228080"," Okay. "
"2228260","2230140"," Let's go over to the, you guys want Tesla gang?"
"2231820","2235300"," We'll draw Tesla, but you have to, I want you to do, I want you to type in the chat,"
"2235780","2240420"," Tesla with a Z, a bunch of Z's, like, T, E, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, Z, L, A."
"2256790","2257370"," Okay, you ready?"
"2258910","2260170"," All right, this is Tesla."
"2261830","2262250"," That's right."
"2262250","2263550"," Give me the Tesla in the chat. "
"2266210","2267170"," Yeah, that's right."
"2267890","2268510"," That's right."
"2268610","2269990"," Give me the Tesla in the chat, baby. "
"2271170","2272770"," We don't have any Tesla bulls here."
"2273950","2274870"," My God."
"2275190","2276650"," What are they all hiding right now?"
"2277450","2280990"," There's a whole Mars catalog out there telling you, please let Tesla go to 80 bucks. "
"2288500","2295240"," If you're Tesla Q, give me a, give me a type in Tesla and replace the Z's with Q's."
"2295240","2296180"," What is that?"
"2296300","2300000"," Like a TSQ's LA or something."
"2302300","2303540"," Where's Winky right now?"
"2303920","2304760"," I wish Winky was here. "
"2304880","2308100"," He'd be like, TAS Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, Q, A."
"2311360","2315600"," I still talk to Winky, by the way, if you guys don't know, I haven't checked chat with him recently"
"2315600","2316100"," too."
"2318460","2320440"," I love Winky, by the way."
"2320560","2320860"," I miss him. "
"2320860","2322160"," I miss him terribly."
"2325180","2326600"," Are you guys ready?"
"2328300","2331740"," You can snip this at home and then post it on social media for me."
"2332660","2333580"," Please do that. "
"2333720","2337560"," If you're Tesla bull, post this on social media for me."
"2337680","2337800"," Okay."
"2340260","2341100"," Here we go. "
"2341160","2341620"," You guys ready?"
"2348900","2351340"," Right above where here."
"2358380","2359680"," Right above there."
"2370770","2371530"," There you go. "
"2371730","2371790"," Simple."
"2372810","2373310"," Two lines."
"2374790","2380390"," And I would gather that you're going to also get this down here. "
"2385100","2386540"," Well, I don't know if it's that low."
"2386780","2390140"," It's probably like right there, but I'm going to gather that you're going to."
"2390420","2392100"," This is a weekly chart, by the way. "
"2393380","2394700"," So I really don't care."
"2395060","2397580"," I really don't care about the intraday stuff."
"2397920","2400560"," This is my like the upside target right there. "
"2401120","2401700"," Maybe 260."
"2402620","2403820"," This is a weekly chart."
"2404100","2409180"," We'll do it on a daily chart if you want it, but I'll be a daily chart. "
"2409400","2411320"," But what you're basically looking at is a weekly chart for Tesla."
"2411640","2411780"," Okay."
"2412380","2416660"," This doesn't account for your intraday and intro, like intraday and for our stuff. "
"2416920","2418340"," I still think you're going to 200."
"2419360","2420720"," 260 would be the high."
"2422460","2425840"," Then you're going to come back down here and we're going to sweep this stuff up right here. "
"2426580","2428540"," And then you're going to hit almost 300."
"2429000","2431060"," Just under 300 here."
"2432420","2434220"," Probably snap a box here for you. "
"2435820","2436220"," Right."
"2438660","2440300"," No, I think we get it all the way up here."
"2440460","2441060"," I think we'll take that. "
"2441180","2442200"," It's going to be pretty bullish, so."
"2443420","2444240"," Yeah, right there."
"2449180","2450700"," We'll draw that one right there. "
"2451560","2454380"," And we're going to draw this one right down in there."
"2458220","2460100"," That's my expectations right in there."
"2460160","2461260"," It's a weekly chart on Tesla. "
"2462260","2463400"," That's what I think happens."
"2464840","2470800"," Now this can be if we did something like this started going up."
"2471660","2474860"," That's fine, but I do think that we reject. "
"2474860","2476920"," I should draw that in too."
"2477320","2480240"," Let me draw it this way."
"2480840","2481240"," Like that. "
"2482540","2483660"," That's better like that."
"2488110","2490150"," And I'm going to put another one up here for you."
"2491710","2492470"," Right there. "
"2496250","2497990"," That's your hard top right there."
"2499450","2503010"," You're likely only going to trade at best you'll get 260."
"2503530","2507570"," I think you're going to get 200 to 260. "
"2508890","2511470"," We'll put the median in at 240."
"2512470","2515170"," So right around two for that monthly trigger right there."
"2517150","2518590"," So you trade this right here. "
"2519110","2521610"," And at some point you're going to get sent down either on the daily."
"2522290","2523650"," I think it's up here."
"2524770","2527710"," You could possibly come up here and take that out right there. "
"2529730","2531510"," It's like somewhere right there."
"2532290","2532690"," See it?"
"2532690","2539710"," And they like to step in."
"2539870","2541850"," And these fucking sellers like to step in. "
"2542690","2544230"," Like you're like, yeah, we're going to get up there."
"2544310","2545530"," And they're like, way them to the downside."
"2546510","2546610"," Right?"
"2547230","2548250"," Before you get right here. "
"2549010","2549910"," Way them to the downside."
"2550470","2552030"," And you're going to trade that lower number."
"2552670","2555270"," Now that lower number could be about $78. "
"2556770","2559310"," You might catch the bounce on 100."
"2560210","2564410"," There is a small gap right here."
"2564410","2569190"," So there's a small gap that has been left behind with our last low down here. "
"2570210","2570890"," This low."
"2571050","2571770"," I don't know if you can see it."
"2572670","2574150"," So this low over here. "
"2576490","2577710"," This low right here."
"2578370","2581670"," There was a tiny gap left like right there."
"2583070","2584990"," So if they close that little gap. "
"2585710","2591210"," And then that's where your rocket ship's going to go to the upside up there."
"2592150","2592470"," Okay."
"2592690","2595030"," So that's if you're a Tesla bull, that's what you should be looking at. "
"2596010","2597510"," Get off the one minute charts."
"2598510","2605130"," And get on to a higher timeframe so you can actually see the direction of where Tesla's going."
"2606250","2608770"," This will all be invalidated. "
"2609430","2612650"," If we were to trade higher than two."
"2614530","2615770"," Two ninety five."
"2616570","2618430"," And it would be invalidated. "
"2619370","2622630"," If we trade and reject below $78 currently."
"2623070","2627110"," It's like you look up tomorrow and Tesla was under like under $78 and started to reject."
"2627670","2628850"," Started doing this nonsense. "
"2629850","2630630"," And that'd be invalidated."
"2631130","2633470"," If we woke up tomorrow and Tesla was like right fucking air."
"2634090","2635310"," That would be invalidated. "
"2635470","2640290"," But otherwise this is all looking like what the track for Tesla is."
"2641690","2642870"," Hope that helps you guys."
"2643630","2644450"," You want to snip that?"
"2644710","2645570"," You can snip it if you want. "
"2646890","2650030"," That's the that's the that's the that's the just the idea of where Tesla's going."
"2651570","2661480"," Yeah, you want to take a look"
"2661480","2662260"," at cost this morning."
"2671520","2673880"," I drew this one out for you right two days ago. "
"2678080","2679340"," Didn't I draw this one out?"
"2681100","2681920"," There we go."
"2684420","2685880"," Well, look at that, huh?"
"2687800","2689700"," Let's take a look at cost really quick."
"2693020","2694240"," Trigger full screen. "
"2694860","2698800"," So on Thursday, I think that Thursday, Wednesday, I think, right?"
"2700000","2700980"," Wednesday or something like that."
"2708820","2711300"," You guys said down then up and then down, right?"
"2711560","2712320"," We went straight up."
"2712920","2715000"," Then we blasted down, sell the news. "
"2716040","2718580"," And now we're trading the daily trigger down here, right?"
"2718720","2719360"," Let me get rid of that stuff."
"2719660","2720900"," If it's really quick so you can see everything."
"2724220","2729480"," And you're coming in a test that daily trigger that is actually the options market bottom two right"
"2729480","2729780"," now. "
"2730340","2736480"," The options market the day before one or two days was two days before their earnings."
"2737520","2741060"," We have this target this target down here, 732."
"2742760","2744340"," 732 on Costco. "
"2744880","2747920"," And if you want to know if I think it's going to bounce here, I do."
"2748440","2756620"," When we looked at Costco, we said that the upside target looked like it was going to be respected."
"2757660","2759480"," Almost perfectly priced, right?"
"2759680","2764180"," That we'd see the upside target and then we'd see the bottom side target. "
"2764440","2768880"," And even if we got good news, it would be down move anyways."
"2770500","2776960"," My fear here with Costco is that it will see it's weekly if not monthly trigger."
"2777820","2783160"," So even if you catch the bounce here for, even if you catch the bounce here for the dealers, right?"
"2784080","2785540"," The dealers are keeping it in here. "
"2785960","2787000"," Burn everybody out."
"2787260","2788920"," Everybody's taking the profit down the downside."
"2789060","2790200"," Everybody's taking the profit on the upside. "
"2790740","2793120"," It looks like they ran it up prior to, right?"
"2794500","2798700"," Looks like they ran it straight up into the upside target before you ever got there, doesn't it?"
"2799420","2800280"," They said, fuck it."
"2800360","2802600"," We don't care what the report's going to be."
"2803640","2804000"," Right?"
"2804900","2807680"," It took the money and ran come into the, can D.E.R., right?"
"2807820","2808500"," Blast all the way down. "
"2808680","2809300"," Now we're heading to the downside."
"2810480","2811540"," Dealers look like they're good."
"2812480","2817120"," So I would say after the, this expiry on, I would say after this expiry, right?"
"2818120","2824800"," That I'm not bullish on Costco, and I'm going to show you why right now. "
"2826640","2829760"," The thing that concerns me with Costco, I'm going to show you why right here."
"2838500","2840400"," When is January?"
"2847240","2850660"," This is January one."
"2851200","2851840"," Right there. "
"2853900","2855700"," This is January one, right here."
"2859400","2861820"," So we're like, whoo, yeah, everything's awesome, right?"
"2862060","2862600"," What do we do here?"
"2863100","2863780"," Consolidate, right?"
"2865480","2867060"," Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom."
"2868060","2869640"," Find out if there's more demand. "
"2870920","2871980"," We're in the beginning of the year."
"2873360","2873980"," And what are we going to do?"
"2874220","2875000"," We're going to party, right?"
"2876420","2878140"," And what do we just do just now?"
"2879960","2880400"," Right?"
"2880600","2882380"," We come into the end of Q3."
"2883020","2884100"," And we're right there. "
"2885880","2889980"," So you're going to be looking for more money to come into the system, right?"
"2890580","2891120"," More money."
"2892100","2896560"," So if you're a Tesla bull, you're going to be looking for something like that to happen again,"
"2896780","2896920"," right?"
"2899020","2908320"," If you're a Tesla bull, or not a Tesla, Costco bull, you're going to be looking for that to happen"
"2908320","2908660"," here."
"2910740","2911780"," Initial sell down. "
"2912340","2914340"," You see this, this is a support right here."
"2914400","2915520"," You see that little bill that I support?"
"2916020","2916880"," See this down here?"
"2917020","2919160"," This is the next known support, right?"
"2920000","2921340"," See that one right there?"
"2924020","2925080"," Right there, right?"
"2925360","2925800"," Boom buyers."
"2926400","2926820"," Boom buyers. "
"2927080","2928220"," That's the big one right there."
"2929480","2932820"," So price target downside minimum 70877."
"2940370","2942490"," Right, known buyers right here. "
"2948720","2950100"," Last known buyers."
"2951020","2952820"," Where's the next last known buyers?"
"2953280","2954060"," Right down here."
"2956200","2959920"," And where did the run start from January?"
"2961200","2962180"," Way down here. "
"2966760","2967580"," Excuse me."
"2968240","2970580"," My target is going to be 677."
"2973440","2973960"," 67720. "
"2974920","2975700"," Right there."
"2977240","2981720"," You could have an extension of the downside all the way down to 642, erase the entire run."
"2982200","2983880"," This is the target though, right there. "
"2985260","2991440"," Your high target, if the dip gets bought, if we begin to turn around, let's say, give like a really"
"2991440","2992400"," bloody moment, right?"
"2992980","2997380"," You bounce and then boom, capitulation and off and run into the upside again."
"2998700","3000020"," So right about there."
"3000400","3004320"," And this is if the market doesn't turn bearish or we don't have a crash or anything of that kind"
"3004320","3004640"," of stuff. "
"3006000","3008440"," We just have a nice normal pullback, that kind of stuff."
"3008800","3010580"," So first target 70877."
"3011540","3014240"," Likely like brief capitulation moments, right?"
"3014800","3015640"," You're like, everything is fine. "
"3015800","3016300"," We're going up again."
"3016440","3018980"," And then straight down and they buy that shit."
"3019720","3020340"," Right down there. "
"3020440","3024200"," Low target, 67720, kind of extension, 6496."
"3024960","3031460"," And no, I am not bullish on Costco restarting again to the upside from right here."
"3031780","3032820"," Not bullish on that. "
"3035360","3037440"," And that's just looking at it on a quarterly basis."
"3038340","3044960"," I'm figuring here, if you're a Costco bull and you had the run on Costco in the beginning of the"
"3044960","3049920"," year, you're going to be like, yeah, I'm going to wait and see if I can get a sweet deal,"
"3050060","3050460"," sweet buy."
"3050460","3051940"," Now, I will say this, okay?"
"3052840","3053800"," I will say this. "
"3059390","3064170"," If it does bounce, it doesn't start doing this stuff."
"3064810","3066430"," You know, that kind of nonsense where it goes down."
"3067870","3068890"," Let me get rid of that. "
"3069550","3079670"," If it does start to consolidate at any point, there's some kind of a breakout, then"
"3079670","3081490"," you can say, yeah, you know what?"
"3081570","3082210"," Cap, you're wrong."
"3082390","3082710"," Fuck you."
"3082790","3083310"," We're going higher. "
"3085530","3089610"," And you could take that trade right there and say I'm a bull again, cap."
"3090070","3092830"," You could trade this if you wanted to as a bull and a bear."
"3094650","3097550"," But truthfully, I don't think you're going to see the buyers here. "
"3099210","3102630"," Once this starts, I think that the buyers are going to say, you know what?"
"3102690","3105010"," I'll just wait and see if we can catch a better low."
"3106250","3108750"," So you can catch a nice new run on cost."
"3108750","3111450"," So yeah, I think the run is over on cost for the moment. "
"3112890","3113810"," Personally, I do."
"3114070","3119270"," I think it's over for the moment and then you're going to be looking for a nice juicy dip buy."
"3119690","3123690"," First target downside target for that dip buy, 70877. "
"3124450","3125650"," So we'll start there."
"3126850","3129970"," We'll start at 70877 on that ticker."
"3131450","3142050"," This is"
"3142050","3142890"," a great run, by the way. "
"3143130","3144410"," For Costco bull, congratulations."
"3144710","3145070"," You did excellent."
"3147550","3148410"," You did great. "
"3148690","3150830"," I mean, there's no like, I want to say something."
"3151270","3152970"," If you're a Costco bull, right?"
"3153770","3154650"," You did fucking awesome."
"3154950","3155930"," You had a great Q1. "
"3156650","3159970"," You actually ran it up into its ER."
"3160470","3161330"," You actually got paid."
"3161970","3167270"," You got paid where you were able to exit before you even had the ER. "
"3168970","3169890"," You know what I'm saying?"
"3170170","3173350"," Like there's not much like a hindsight trading."
"3173350","3175030"," That's what that's what Jedi calls it."
"3175390","3176150"," Hindsight trading. "
"3176430","3177550"," Get a great fucking run."
"3178150","3179850"," You ran it right up in 800 bucks."
"3180630","3182050"," What more could you ask for?"
"3183010","3184270"," You know what that is?"
"3184850","3187110"," A pullback so that you can buy that dip. "
"3188730","3190590"," So I'd say congratulations to you."
"3190690","3191910"," There's didn't win nothing on that."
"3192850","3193690"," Didn't win anything. "
"3194430","3195430"," You got your trade."
"3195770","3197210"," You got your quarterly trade on Costco."
"3198090","3199890"," You ran it up right before even ER. "
"3200470","3202050"," They ran it right up into it."
"3202770","3206310"," Now if you're a Costco bull, you're looking for a dip to buy."
"3207850","3208610"," So congrats. "
"3221370","3223510"," Have a look, see over here and see what's going on with..."
"3224670","3226510"," Let me move these pivots over a little bit."
"3229190","3230170"," I'll make that 50."
"3234570","3236410"," I'm going to slide those over a little bit. "
"3236530","3237610"," Give us some breathing room in here."
"3241030","3241730"," Upside target."
"3242090","3243690"," Still good to go on the upside on spy. "
"3244430","3246370"," No reason here to even get bearish."
"3247010","3248270"," Zero reason to get bearish."
"3248770","3250910"," Just a normal five minute check back here. "
"3251030","3252770"," They're holding the five minute trigger right now."
"3253410","3255970"," Things will get volatile as we make our way up there."
"3256090","3257770"," So you will see five minute pullbacks. "
"3258550","3259030"," Until."
"3260630","3261110"," Until."
"3262710","3264830"," You see a one in five minute cross. "
"3266190","3269690"," And the confirmation rejection of weakness from bulls."
"3270350","3272330"," You are not a seller of spy this morning."
"3275470","3277610"," You need to see..."
"3281130","3285190"," Well number one, you're going to get bears out there that are like, I'm on puts. "
"3286290","3287430"," They're going to tell you that all morning."
"3287930","3297210"," I'm on puts, I'm on puts, I'm on puts."
"3299420","3301460"," Until you get that cross right there, right?"
"3301700","3302620"," You already know what it is, right?"
"3302840","3303700"," We zigzag in here. "
"3304380","3305180"," They blood you."
"3305840","3307000"," We come back up."
"3307880","3309440"," And then you get the failure to the downside. "
"3311600","3313320"," Tactic, tactical baby."
"3315520","3317120"," You're a tactical trader."
"3319000","3321960"," We are pros so you don't get to wear tactical gear. "
"3322880","3324600"," But you do get to wear tactical gear."
"3324600","3329260"," If you're a tactical trader, you're going to."
"3329500","3330760"," That's a new word for us. "
"3331920","3333340"," You're a tactical trader."
"3340420","3342620"," For the tools that you have."
"3343800","3345100"," Your plate carriers. "
"3345460","3345980"," It's okay."
"3348280","3350020"," Your NVGs are all right."
"3350200","3351380"," Not the best NVGs. "
"3351600","3352160"," They're pretty good."
"3357720","3359280"," That's what you have in front of you."
"3362380","3363400"," Remember what I said?"
"3363560","3367460"," You can have violence and volatility as we do this, right?"
"3367600","3369440"," You can see it right now on book map, right?"
"3371080","3371480"," Violence. "
"3373220","3376560"," I saw someone else on, you know what someone else on Twitter said the other day?"
"3376680","3381380"," They said, I fucking hate trading all time highs."
"3382200","3383420"," They're like, I fucking hate it."
"3384280","3387420"," I told them I said, I like buying the dips on these things, man. "
"3387760","3389640"," I hate trading all time highs too."
"3391200","3392500"," This is what happens, right?"
"3392640","3394200"," You get violence in that move."
"3394900","3397580"," And I'm always like, dude, just give me a bounce off the daily trigger. "
"3398060","3399540"," Give me a bounce off the hourly trigger."
"3399820","3400400"," Any of those things."
"3401240","3406080"," Bounce it so that I can take it to the first known resistance safety. "
"3407640","3408440"," Does that make sense?"
"3411800","3413400"," See, I'm with you."
"3413600","3416740"," If you're like one of those people that's like, I can't stand this."
"3417240","3418780"," You can see some of you guys talking about it. "
"3418920","3421240"," I understand that."
"3421800","3422960"," Look at all this doom right here."
"3423780","3426000"," Look at all this hot sauce and doom as we trade higher. "
"3427500","3429100"," This is my first target, by the way."
"3429180","3430600"," This 517, 518."
"3432260","3434480"," If we do go to 520, it's going to be violent. "
"3435140","3437260"," Now let's take a look really quick and see what's happening here."
"3437260","3438680"," See down below right here?"
"3438780","3439080"," Watch this."
"3439240","3440320"," Watch what's happening right here. "
"3443740","3445180"," Look at all this down here."
"3445300","3447000"," Look at all this mess down here."
"3448220","3449680"," See all that mess down there?"
"3449800","3450920"," We haven't lost support yet, though. "
"3451460","3452180"," Too many violence."
"3458460","3458900"," Yeah."
"3459220","3462660"," Well, if you're in calls right now, I would just fucking hold them. "
"3462900","3463900"," Oh, not financial advice."
"3466660","3468700"," When we go into volatility, right?"
"3470380","3475900"," You usually just, if you're fucked up in your position, you just wait a minute."
"3478880","3481280"," Because you're going to go, you're going to be like, in the money out of the money, in the money"
"3481280","3482740"," out of the money, in the money out of the money. "
"3483220","3485200"," And you're going to be like, oh, fuck, I should have just held."
"3487380","3491720"," If we're in no volatility and you're like in the wrong side of that trade, you're likely just going"
"3491720","3494500"," to get blooded right to the top or blooded right down to the bottom."
"3494500","3499000"," But if you start getting that volatility and you're like getting all cut up and you're like, I got"
"3499000","3499320"," stops. "
"3499660","3501420"," I got these stops and those stops."
"3501840","3505240"," You're likely a lot of times you're going to come back and go, fuck that shit."
"3505360","3506840"," That position came back in the money again. "
"3511740","3517260"," But at any rate, at any rate, I should say."
"3521320","3522360"," Let's see it right there."
"3525020","3526220"," There's savages in here. "
"3526320","3526620"," Look at them."
"3528640","3531220"," Well, Captain James hanging out with you guys every day."
"3539470","3541250"," How long have you been hanging out here, by the way?"
"3543130","3544450"," Three years, I think, right?"
"3544670","3545490"," It's been about three years. "
"3546290","3546990"," It's been a long time."
"3549370","3553050"," I've been I've been a more friends with a lot of you than I am with a lot of people"
"3553050","3553630"," in my life."
"3553830","3557730"," I spend more time with you guys than I do with my own family. "
"3562050","3562950"," I'll tell you this."
"3566470","3571510"," My real friends and family know what I do in real life."
"3573290","3575370"," I don't tell anybody that I just meet. "
"3577750","3580090"," And they wouldn't understand either."
"3582190","3583510"," If they're like, what do you do?"
"3583670","3585690"," And I'm like, well, I hang out with a bunch of people all day long."
"3587390","3588370"," Eight hours a day. "
"3590390","3591890"," I got friends all over the world."
"3593330","3594550"," How do you even tell people that?"
"3598290","3599370"," I'm your friend too, guys."
"3599590","3600170"," I'm your friend. "
"3600690","3601490"," You guys are my friends."
"3601870","3603110"," I just don't know how to explain it to people."
"3607650","3610510"," Hang on with a bunch of weirdo trader investors all day long. "
"3610650","3611090"," Those are my buddies."
"3614710","3616650"," I don't know how to explain it to people."
"3616770","3617650"," I've done it before. "
"3617870","3619430"," I have explained it to people I meet."
"3619930","3623090"," Like my family and friends that I've known forever, they're fine."
"3623330","3623910"," They all know about it. "
"3624430","3628330"," But whenever I try to explain it to a new friend, they're like, you do what?"
"3630210","3631950"," I feel like they look at me weird differently."
"3633390","3634290"," I don't know why that is."
"3636030","3637830"," I don't know what that phenomenon is. "
"3637910","3638830"," There's a phenomenon behind it."
"3638830","3640230"," I don't know what that phenomenon is."
"3640230","3641370"," Maybe somebody could explain it. "
"3641490","3645830"," Like my family, my long-term friends."
"3647650","3652510"," Maybe it's because they were used to me starting to do this."
"3653510","3654370"," Maybe that's it. "
"3656030","3656930"," They're like, look at him."
"3656990","3659490"," He's going to go over there and try to talk to the ether."
"3660130","3660730"," No one's going to listen. "
"3661630","3663570"," No one's going to watch me talking to nobody."
"3667230","3670410"," So last night I was trying to go to sleep."
"3671770","3674410"," Last night I was trying to go to sleep, right?"
"3675290","3678530"," I was watching some Twitch videos. "
"3680490","3682590"," There was a guy on Twitch."
"3684010","3689770"," He was showing videos of Twitch streamers that have nobody watching them."
"3690190","3691650"," Really cool people too. "
"3693250","3696210"," And so I was like, man, we're going to do that here one day."
"3697050","3699430"," Because we had done a raid, a good raid."
"3699830","3700650"," I think they call them raids. "
"3701570","3705750"," We did a raid the other day for Mike from figuring out money."
"3706350","3707630"," He started streaming on Twitch."
"3708550","3713870"," I don't know if he already did stream on Twitch or not, but someone in here said that he had"
"3713870","3714450"," started streaming. "
"3714690","3716190"," I think it was D-dad Gold or somebody said."
"3717210","3719870"," Mike Silver's Twitch streaming."
"3720630","3723630"," So we went over there and did a raid and went and checked him out and hung out with him. "
"3724510","3727170"," But I think we should do that here on Twitch one of these days."
"3728250","3734650"," I think we should find a streamer that's maybe a financial streamer or something."
"3734990","3740170"," Or I don't know, someone that's like, hey, I like the SPY or I like Tesla or I like, I"
"3740170","3740630"," don't know, I'm a bear. "
"3741110","3741790"," I don't even do a bear."
"3741790","3751770"," So if you guys ever out there ever find anybody on Twitch specifically that"
"3751770","3754570"," you know of that doesn't have anybody watching their video."
"3754570","3756870"," I don't care if it's a guy, girl, they, they, them. "
"3757010","3759170"," I don't care what they are, but you like them."
"3760970","3766870"," If you guys know anybody out there that you're like, hey, I watched this person on Twitch and I"
"3766870","3767730"," really like what they do."
"3768910","3774150"," I'd be really super down to like, end the stream one day and just be like, let's go over and"
"3774150","3776990"," hang out with these people and let's go hang out with them. "
"3778090","3783070"," So I was watching these videos last night and I was like, they're really cool."
"3783170","3787130"," When you have nobody watching you, it's really cool."
"3789630","3796910"," I was watching some of these people with no, no viewers, no friends, no long time, like develop"
"3796910","3797750"," relationships. "
"3798650","3801970"," And I'm listening to what they're saying and I'm like, man, I can relate to that person."
"3802650","3804930"," I was like, they sound like my life, right?"
"3805250","3812830"," Like they're on it, like brutally honest and just talking about life or their passions or their,"
"3813570","3815250"," whatever it is that they do."
"3815250","3815470"," Right. "
"3815630","3824450"," One guy was like, he was like cutting, he was trimming trees and making, turning them into,"
"3824870","3828650"," turning them into like totems."
"3829210","3830210"," I think he's Hawaiian."
"3831070","3833830"," And he had nobody, no viewers or something like that. "
"3834050","3840210"," And I think there's like a Twitch stream and you guys know that trades or something like that."
"3840590","3841650"," Let me know who it is."
"3846550","3848390"," Now, when's Mike coming to the show?"
"3849210","3850410"," I have to talk to him. "
"3850490","3852810"," I've been, so we just soft launched the website."
"3854170","3859630"," And so I've been crazy busy, crazy."
"3860610","3861070"," I'm not sleeping. "
"3861330","3863010"," I haven't slept in three days."
"3864390","3867270"," I got three hours of sleep last night."
"3868410","3873810"," And I think I got two hours the night before that I had to prepare for the Senate hearings. "
"3874570","3876710"," I think I got maybe three hours that night."
"3876710","3880690"," I think I'm on day three or four of no, no real sleep."
"3881670","3883190"," Maybe, maybe day four at this point. "
"3884550","3890070"," So as soon as things come down, I will, I'm going to be reaching out to a bunch of people."
"3890450","3891850"," We'll have a mirror on the show."
"3892090","3893850"," We'll have an ass face on the show. "
"3894330","3895790"," Hopefully, if they still agree."
"3896750","3897450"," We'll have a mirror come on."
"3897650","3898510"," We'll have Jedi come on. "
"3899210","3901490"," We'll have, or we're going to at least ask these guys to come on."
"3902310","3902930"," Who else?"
"3903590","3905870"," Mike, Mike Silva, a whole bunch of people."
"3906350","3907810"," We've got a long list. "
"3908650","3912630"," And we want to talk to these people because I value what they say."
"3912970","3914130"," ST short seller, right?"
"3914750","3915390"," I want to pick his brain."
"3916150","3919070"," Matter of fact, he's a good one. "
"3920610","3923370"," I don't even want to talk market with short seller."
"3924130","3925310"," I just want to hang out with the guy."
"3926410","3928810"," I know he was renovating his house. "
"3930510","3932570"," He's been doing that for I think a year or two now."
"3933030","3935730"," I'd like to just hang out with that guy and be like, Hey, man, how's the house going?"
"3936570","3937770"," Show us some pictures, dude."
"3938250","3939370"," Like, let's see it. "
"3941370","3943110"," So that guy does so much."
"3943290","3945270"," That guy does so much for people on Fintuit."
"3945670","3947530"," That'd be kind of cool to just talk to him. "
"3954250","3956130"," Yeah, we can catch up sleep."
"3956670","3959430"," I'm hoping to get that this weekend, but I can't."
"3959590","3960670"," Like so on Saturday. "
"3963230","3965310"," So on Saturday, we're trying."
"3965630","3966270"," I'm trying to."
"3966530","3974150"," I'm trying to find a way for people to have a voice to our community. "
"3975910","3977650"," Trader podcast is one of those people."
"3978870","3979810"," I'm trying to get up."
"3980350","3982250"," I'm trying to be able to give a vehicle to. "
"3983430","3990370"," Trader podcast David AMS guys like short seller ST. If they've ever if they ever want a place to be"
"3990370","3991830"," like, Hey, I want to have a voice here."
"3992630","3994930"," To be able to at least say, Hey, man, if you want, that's yours."
"3996850","3999250"," You guys know how like you guys want to know. "
"4001430","4002510"," You're going to think I'm crazy."
"4003670","4008530"," Now you know what I appreciate is who I really like."
"4008870","4013390"," I really like stock charts dot com. "
"4014710","4020110"," If you guys know stock charts dot com, Mike Silva has a close relationship with those guys."
"4020470","4023890"," I think I like stock charts dot com."
"4024150","4029630"," It's a it's like a it's like a network of some really great traders. "
"4030910","4033790"," Investors bears all kinds of different people."
"4034750","4040650"," And what I find fascinating about stock charts dot com is guys like Larry Williams."
"4042250","4044330"," Are a part of stock charts dot com. "
"4045130","4050090"," I don't know if you know who he is, but he's one of my heroes, not mentor, but hero, right?"
"4050450","4052330"," No, I should say mentor to he's not my mentor."
"4052670","4057150"," Yeah, I've never been a student or a student of his, but not directly."
"4057910","4058390"," So. "
"4059690","4063410"," But that guy's a fucking badass legitimate."
"4064450","4064830"," Bad ass."
"4065730","4071070"," And I like how they do this stuff over there, but a lot of those guys are getting old. "
"4072670","4074930"," They're not aged out, but they're not."
"4075090","4079490"," And it's funny to say I talked to Larry once and I was like, I love that you're still doing"
"4079490","4080130"," what you're doing."
"4080330","4083190"," And he was like, who's like, I got nothing else better to do. "
"4083190","4086050"," So I'm just going to keep keep fucking around and helping retailers out."
"4086050","4087710"," And I was like, I love you, Larry."
"4088310","4094570"," And, uh, but I'm like, yeah, you know, if we could do something like that with, uh, like a, like"
"4094570","4101950"," a short seller ST or a day that ams or a, um, like a trader podcast or I think it'd"
"4101950","4102890"," be fucking cool. "
"4103229","4106069"," So I don't know if it doesn't work."
"4106149","4106490"," It doesn't work."
"4107490","4110670"," Uh, Mike Silva, like, you know, get, get wrapped up with him. "
"4110670","4112010"," Do it, do a collab with him."
"4112529","4118010"," I think it's kind of cool to like have a network of, uh, traders and stuff and investors and it"
"4118010","4119770"," might not be what you might be like, yeah, you know what?"
"4119830","4122410"," I don't like Kevin Jim James and his, his, how he trades."
"4122910","4127410"," I like how David trades or I like how trader podcast trades or I like how Mike Silva trades. "
"4128149","4129710"," Or, you know, dude, right?"
"4129950","4131310"," So before I started streaming, right, right?"
"4131450","4137149"," I had regime like I'm going to go watch, uh, I'm going to go watch Maverick of Wall Street, but"
"4137149","4138310"," I'm going to go watch Mike Silva."
"4138310","4143290"," Then I'm going to go watch, um, what's the name, Adam from, uh, FX Evolution."
"4144090","4147529"," Uh, so I might remember routine, you know, I'm going to go see all these different guys at"
"4147529","4147729"," nighttime. "
"4148290","4152870"," And I would fucking love to see like a, uh, just a group of us that you could have a,"
"4152990","4153770"," you could be like, yeah, I'm going to go."
"4154229","4156930"," I'm going to go, uh, I'm going to go get my bear over here."
"4157189","4159729"," I'm going to go get my technical shift from this guy over there. "
"4160130","4163350"," And then I'm going to go over there and I'm going to talk to this, uh, this, uh, you know,"
"4163609","4164710"," uh, all right."
"4164850","4165310"," Trade, trade."
"4165310","4165569"," I've trade. "
"4165890","4166189"," Globex."
"4166450","4167250"," I'm a nighttime trader."
"4167470","4168850"," I'm going to go trade with David AMS at midnight. "
"4170310","4171830"," You know, I'm not here during the daytime."
"4172050","4176790"," These guys are all trading at 9 a.m. Well, I guess David still does trade at 9 a.m."
"4176890","4182870"," But, um, you know, so just whatever you like, whatever you're into or you want to learn something"
"4182870","4183130"," new."
"4184090","4189430"," No, there's those people, uh, those relationships are formed and you guys have access to them. "
"4189990","4191270"," So I don't know if we can do it."
"4191270","4193570"," If it fails, it fails, but we'll try it."
"4193690","4194030"," See what happens. "
"4197720","4199520"," You know, I haven't seen those Canadian guys."
"4199900","4201380"," I did, I did check them out."
"4201980","4205120"," I just haven't had the time to, but I heard those guys were awesome, by the way. "
"4205800","4206880"," I heard those guys were awesome."
"4207720","4208800"," Uh, I did catch them once."
"4209080","4210760"," I want one or two people recommend them to me. "
"4210940","4212140"," I don't, I don't have the time anymore."
"4213020","4214660"," Like there was two, it was two things."
"4216180","4221200"," So number one, uh, I don't have the time right now, but number two. "
"4221660","4226140"," Uh, when I used to watch a lot of these guys, they would not poison me, but it would be"
"4226140","4227320"," like they'd rub off on me."
"4228000","4232760"," And I'm trying to, trying to do my own thing so that I'm not like, um, regurgitating."
"4233340","4237360"," I want to like do my own research, check out all this other stuff and be like, okay, here's my"
"4237360","4237720"," opinion. "
"4238480","4239560"," Uh, what I think is going to happen."
"4240280","4245240"," So, um, so I try not to, um, try not to do that anymore."
"4245240","4247820"," So, it was like double sided. "
"4247820","4249120"," I don't have the time on the one side."
"4249320","4250760"," And then there's that too."
"4255030","4255770"," Yeah, absolutely. "
"4256910","4257310"," 100%."
"4258570","4258970"," Absolutely."
"4261910","4262530"," Oh, sorry. "
"4262650","4263330"," Tom Atkinson."
"4263790","4266410"," I said, did I say, I call him, I say Alex or something."
"4267190","4268430"," Tom Atkinson, that's his name. "
"4269330","4270030"," I like Tom a lot."
"4270550","4275150"," The guys, the guys, the great system guys, like how he lays everything out for you."
"4275150","4280370"," Does the memes, does the news, does the expected stuff, goes through all the indexes every night. "
"4281290","4282770"," Gives you like a full market profile."
"4284570","4285210"," It's great."
"4290580","4293660"," Uh, any chance on a, uh, so Tesla on us. "
"4294000","4298020"," So Tesla on a, uh, on a smaller timeframe should go like this."
"4299820","4301520"," Tesla should go like this."
"4302400","4302740"," Up. "
"4303220","4305100"," Oh, you guys can't see that go like this."
"4306060","4307720"," And then explosive move higher."
"4316940","4318020"," I like all those guys. "
"4318260","4318680"," I think they'll do."
"4318840","4321660"," I also like a Maverick of Wall Street too."
"4323080","4329200"," Maverick of Wall Street is, um, uh, what I like about Maverick is like, well, right. "
"4329460","4330460"," So Maverick, I like his production."
"4331180","4335040"," I'm like, that guy had to have been the TV or movie industry had to be."
"4335860","4339460"," And then like, there's no way that he wasn't, right?"
"4339460","4343220"," The second thing we like about him is that he like gets his bear out for you. "
"4343240","4346160"," He's like fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud, fraud."
"4346800","4348760"," But then he's like, we're going to buy these stocks over here."
"4349360","4354060"," Like he wraps the show with here's your, here's your upside trades for the week or for tonight. "
"4356580","4358980"," He's like, he's a little more realistic as a bear."
"4359300","4361520"," He's like, did y'all shake the bear out with me tonight?"
"4361860","4362960"," And I'm like, I love this guy."
"4367360","4368700"," Yeah, I like him too. "
"4368980","4372320"," I'll, I've never met him, never talked to him, but I would love to talk to him."
"4372520","4372820"," He's awesome."
"4373480","4375300"," He's got a sexy voice too, doesn't he?"
"4376120","4380780"," He reminds me of, uh, who's the guy from Antonio Banderas?"
"4383080","4384780"," Oh, he used to work in the casino industry. "
"4385020","4385520"," I didn't know that."
"4386000","4386860"," I had no idea."
"4388440","4392100"," He's, um, he reminds me of, um, of Antonio Banderas. "
"4393360","4395620"," I'm like, he could, he could have sex with me with his voice."
"4407860","4409400"," You guys have never seen him?"
"4410460","4411120"," Tell him that."
"4411220","4411800"," Tell him this. "
"4412220","4416440"," If you guys watch one of his shows, just say, uh, they, I just want you to know that Captain"
"4416440","4421140"," James is a quiet, uh, like lover of your show and your voice."
"4423940","4425140"," Nothing sexually implied."
"4435530","4436330"," That's me too. "
"4441630","4443910"," Yeah, I think he's, I think he's very, he's funny."
"4444170","4444710"," He's well researched."
"4445510","4450830"," Do you think I would, if I had a question for him, I'd want to know if he, they're trying"
"4450830","4452190"," to rug pull you right now, by the way. "
"4452670","4455630"," If I had a question for him, uh, it would be."
"4456010","4457550"," Uh, how do you do your production?"
"4457550","4458490"," Is it one person?"
"4460450","4462190"," Or is it, uh, is it one person?"
"4462390","4463190"," Watch out for the rug pull."
"4463250","4463690"," You see it?"
"4464910","4466430"," They're trying to rug pull you right now. "
"4467630","4476290"," If there was one, um, if there was one, uh, what, like one, or one or two questions that had"
"4476290","4479570"," formed, it would be, uh, do you do your own production work?"
"4480390","4481870"," Does anybody help you write the script?"
"4482990","4485850"," And, uh, how do you decide what the show's going to be every day?"
"4486930","4489870"," Because I'm like, I would find it hard to do that show that he does."
"4491850","4493370"," Oh, look at these bears down here."
"4493450","4494670"," They're all getting excited, aren't they?"
"4495390","4496850"," Are they all dooming and gluing in this right here?"
"4496970","4497790"," Look at them all dooming gloom. "
"4498730","4501210"," I'm going to probably try to buy some calls here in just a moment."
"4501950","4502990"," We want a quick second here."
"4506930","4508450"," I like this doom right here. "
"4511330","4513390"," Trying to give me some fucking hope down here."
"4513530","4514650"," You're going to try to give me a dip to buy."
"4515110","4516070"," Hold on one second. "
"4516210","4517030"," Don't go up yet."
"4517290","4517530"," Hold on."
"4526720","4530800"," Five twenties or so five twenties or twelve cents right now. "
"4532640","4534680"," I'm going to expect those to get burned."
"4536160","4537320"," So they're at twelve cents."
"4537460","4537640"," Okay. "
"4539480","4541520"," So let's let me let those come off a little bit."
"4542980","4544500"," Now they're ten cents."
"4545100","4547720"," I'm not going to try to buy five twelve or five twenties. "
"4549140","4554080"," Those are even if we go to five twenty, they likely want those to be worth zero."
"4555680","4556960"," So I'm not going to buy those."
"4557220","4559120"," I'm going to look something a little bit more in the money. "
"4560460","4562000"," Five eighteen's look pretty good."
"4563020","4564120"," Oh, they're all that."
"4566100","4567200"," I think tight guys. "
"4577080","4579760"," I fucking hate this new tasty dude."
"4579760","4581520"," I'm not down with this new tasty shit."
"4589740","4591280"," Are you guys liking the new tasty?"
"4593640","4595160"," I realize it's new. "
"4595580","4596680"," It's going to take time."
"4597560","4598260"," I don't know if I like the."
"4598500","4601180"," I don't know if I like how it reminds me of Webull. "
"4606000","4606580"," All right."
"4606720","4613540"," So I'm looking at five eighteen C's there right now."
"4626240","4627000"," All right. "
"4627020","4628120"," I got a trade set up here."
"4630040","4632600"," I'm looking at five eighteen C's."
"4642790","4643750"," Here we go. "
"4702400","4708860"," Also note that SPX has a gap down below at fifty one fifty eight seventy three."
"4709500","4710540"," The needs filled."
"4718120","4718800"," Right. "
"4735840","4738380"," There's a gap right here."
"4806580","4807240"," Clear the gap."
"4881050","4883550"," Watch out for the confirmation train on the cross above. "
"4910870","4911770"," Come on baby."
"4929360","4930500"," There's the gap down below."
"4930620","4932100"," If you want to look at it, it's right down here. "
"4933540","4934320"," You want to see it?"
"4934620","4935280"," It's right down below."
"4999930","5000690"," Come on baby."
"5014150","5015090"," Come on baby. "
"5021420","5021780"," Fuck."
"5021920","5022520"," They're going to make the wait."
"5042590","5057030"," Now they're going to make the wait. "
"5075720","5076940"," Let's do it faster."
"5077460","5078580"," Just nice and fast."
"5101930","5102690"," Come on. "
"5138550","5141350"," I'm wondering if they're going to give me the gap closer or not."
"5141490","5141950"," They might not."
"5154100","5157720"," See these buyers stepping in down below right now and SPX over here. "
"5158520","5159660"," See that bounce right there?"
"5160520","5161460"," I want this right here."
"5163320","5166260"," I want that and then your upside move right there."
"5169520","5172060"," But it doesn't look like they want to give it to me. "
"5296450","5297610"," So you can see it."
"5314310","5325990"," Right there."
"5329590","5331030"," Trying to buy four. "
"5331830","5333830"," Sorry, five eighteen C's."
"5357410","5359290"," You guys might not be able to see this over here."
"5361510","5363950"," Just so you can see it from the side right there. "
"5363950","5364410"," You see it."
"5364710","5366010"," There's the gap right there."
"5366390","5367010"," You guys see that?"
"5367130","5368150"," Yeah, you guys can see that. "
"5385460","5386200"," Come on baby."
"5390160","5391940"," The gap's being closed right now."
"5409780","5413360"," Long five eighteen C's for twenty three cents. "
"5413360","5414340"," Twenty four cents."
"5440150","5441630"," I guess maybe the gap was lower."
"5441810","5443750"," The gap was up here. "
"5444510","5446230"," So this is a different gap down below."
"5446390","5447330"," I hope I'll get caught in this."
"5448010","5449930"," So I guess this is the gap right here. "
"5451030","5451730"," That's the gap."
"5453650","5455270"," But there's one more down below it."
"5455390","5456830"," So I don't want to get caught in this. "
"5457030","5457430"," I'm going to keep."
"5457770","5459730"," If I start to get blasted here."

"5501730","5502790"," Nobody's buying this by the way. "
"5502810","5503690"," It's only me buying it."
"5505250","5507590"," There's there's no premium kick right now."
"5507770","5509170"," Trading twenty five twenty six. "
"5515820","5517100"," Trading twenty seven."
"5525200","5528380"," If this starts to break any lower here at any point."
"5528400","5529360"," I'll cut them loose. "
"5542080","5543300"," I don't want to get flushed."
"5543720","5544400"," I'll be pissed."
"5544800","5546460"," They sweep it like flush it and sweep it. "
"5546500","5547020"," I'll be mad."
"5549200","5550860"," Trading twenty seven right now."
"5551660","5552280"," Twenty eight. "

"5573190","5574350"," Trading twenty six. "
"5606860","5609800"," I got a stop loss on now just in case I get rolled here."
"5621760","5624120"," There's a whole other gap down below here."
"5640260","5642640"," They like this whole zone down in here. "
"5643480","5644900"," So just be careful if you're long here."
"5665020","5666800"," They're trying to take my stops right now."
"5676780","5677820"," Nope, not yet. "
"5682930","5684550"," They're fucking hunting me for sure."
"5687990","5690010"," I fucking hate these algos."
"5690470","5692450"," I fucking hate algos. "
"5693290","5695550"," I do like to spies them."

"5767690","5769970"," That candle right there just took me. "
"5772410","5775050"," If we reverse here to the upside, I'm going to be fucking pissed."
"5808580","5809860"," God damn it."
"5812280","5813240"," Fucking mad. "
"5821740","5823280"," That fucking right there."

"5846060","5847960"," I'll be so pissed at this reverses."
"5851840","5855640"," So next chance for me to try to get into the trades and be right down here in this hourly"
"5855640","5855960"," trigger."
"5856960","5859640"," If we can roll down, I'll buy that next. "
"5859960","5861380"," So this one right here, I'll try to buy."
"5863520","5865500"," Stopped out on this candle right here."
"5869650","5870530"," We'll try it again. "
"5908360","5910720"," I'll be pissed if this swings up on me too."
"5910960","5915440"," So we start swinging here."
"5915500","5917660"," You see that white line starting to turn sideways here?"
"5918520","5920940"," If we start doing this shit, it's going to leave me behind. "
"5920940","5923860"," I'll end up losing the, like not be able to jump on the trade or anything."
"5930580","5932740"," See that nice flattening happening right now?"
"5933340","5934780"," See how like we have vertical right here?"
"5935340","5935720"," Straight down."
"5936560","5938500"," See that turn happening right now?"
"5954560","5957040"," Oh, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice, nice. "
"5957800","5958880"," I don't feel so bad anymore."
"5981660","5984280"," Same trade, 518Cs."
"5994850","5996570"," Gap is right here. "
"6038050","6039990"," Actually, 516s look pretty good."
"6048970","6051730"," I'm going to move up to 516s."
"6117330","6119070"," Hey, are you guys having problems?"
"6120130","6124710"," Any guys having problems like executing trades on Tasty?"
"6126810","6136740"," I don't"
"6136740","6137680"," know if it's executing trades. "
"6137840","6147560"," I'm having a problem trying to get on the trade, I should say, like highlighting the strike and"
"6147560","6151940"," then adding a, right there."
"6155980","6161460"," I'm having problems like I click on the strike and then I'm not able, it won't, it won't, it won't"
"6161460","6161660"," click."
"6183960","6188460"," I'm long right now on 516C. "
"6190340","6191980"," Trying to, one more time right now."
"6197790","6198870"," Move that out of the way."
"6204300","6206940"," It's more down to go here on this hourly trigger. "
"6208100","6210860"," So I got to watch out for that right there, but I am long here."
"6211300","6213980"," Even though, even though it's a little bit high, I only got in like right here."
"6226900","6228460"," I'm back in some more too. "
"6228560","6230700"," I just added another 10 on this bar."
"6231420","6232740"," This adds to my position."
"6232920","6237920"," I had 10 more calls for that tick right there. "
"6244390","6245670"," So I'm long right now."
"6246410","6247970"," 516, I'm going to leave these ones on."
"6248110","6248870"," I'm not going to get rid of them. "
"6248970","6253090"," I'm likely going to leave these on all day long unless we begin to break below the hourly trigger"
"6253090","6254630"," and begin to reject."
"6255090","6260230"," So if any of this stuff starts happening down here, I'll cut them loose, but I'm leaving these on"
"6260230","6260890"," at this point."
"6261390","6262850"," I'm sweating bullets. "
"6263530","6266770"," Watch out for this half hour trigger above."
"6272490","6278830"," What I don't want to have happen here is a rejection above on the half hour."
"6278930","6280250"," We start to blast down below. "
"6282230","6285190"," So now long, 516Cs for today."
"6286430","6287570"," It's a nice wick right there too."
"6287670","6288210"," I like that wick. "
"6288210","6288870"," That's a good wick."
"6291370","6291810"," Oh."
"6296110","6298610"," This is last known demand too right in here. "
"6300730","6303050"," There's a whole nother fucking gap down below too."
"6303250","6303950"," There's a giant gap."
"6304090","6304670"," Look at it down here. "
"6304730","6305370"," There's a giant gap."
"6305510","6306610"," There's an air gap down here."
"6306730","6307070"," You see that?"
"6310870","6313090"," Keep your eyes down below here. "
"6313250","6315370"," You see that gap right here?"
"6315690","6316470"," That's 61 million."
"6316950","6319770"," Talk about a bloodbath down to the gamma flip down there."
"6322090","6323190"," So I'm going to hold these. "
"6323710","6326110"," If we lose this right here, right, get paired up."
"6327490","6329570"," Let me switch down there and show you as this."
"6334640","6336460"," This is the gamma down here. "
"6336560","6337920"," You see this gamma flip down here?"
"6338120","6338560"," 5100."
"6339720","6341500"," If the bulls lose this, right?"
"6342820","6344980"," Bloodbath down to 5110."
"6345160","6346620"," I just bought this right here. "
"6347760","6348200"," 516C."
"6359000","6361980"," That was the spy gap down below if you want to see it."
"6366170","6367950"," Let's show you that one right there. "
"6368050","6369310"," Do you see that big wick right here?"
"6370270","6372070"," Big giant wick right there."
"6380530","6381850"," I'm not doing that good."
"6385430","6387290"," Let's see if they try to send this down. "
"6388490","6390890"," I don't want to see any rejections down here."
"6390890","6394770"," I don't want to see any rejections off this half hour trigger."
"6399180","6400560"," It'd be good night bulls. "
"6400780","6402800"," I'd probably buy some puts if we reject this."
"6404800","6418720"," I still"
"6418720","6419560"," know premium kick."
"6419660","6424040"," I'm up to 57 cents right now, but still no major premium kick here. "
"6424880","6426940"," This looks like bulls have gone home for the day."
"6429180","6430500"," I'm trading 58 right now."
"6431820","6441360"," 56.55. 54.53. I"
"6441360","6443200"," bought this candle right here. "
"6444560","6446000"," I bought that candle."
"6447140","6450780"," Then I bought this one right up above it right there."
"6458770","6463750"," If bulls lose 514.07, put your seatbelts on. "
"6476340","6488700"," I should close my laptop and come back at 4 p.m. I'm"
"6488700","6490180"," drinking out of my wife's cup this morning."
"6493000","6494800"," Get my wife's coffee cup."
"6495940","6497320"," I have a hero and a collar mom. "
"6499040","6500860"," Trading 62 right now."
"6501600","6501980"," 64."
"6503800","6507960"," I am way above my loss of my L on the other trade on 518. "
"6510860","6512840"," I'm green right now in the morning."
"6513160","6514080"," I'm happy right now."
"6515900","6517700"," Trading 63 right now. "
"6517800","6518660"," Getting a nice little pump."
"6521820","6522460"," 65."
"6538910","6539550"," 64. "
"6548810","6549450"," 66."
"6552510","6554510"," This is the key moment right here."
"6555090","6558910"," This moment right here is going to be the big boy right here. "
"6561070","6565090"," If this gets rejected, we start breaking this prior low on the hourly trigger."
"6565470","6568370"," I'm going to fucking be done for the day or puts into the clothes."
"6572450","6574870"," This is a big moment for the market right here. "
"6586810","6589830"," I'm swinging like $0.10 like it's nobody's business too."
"6592270","6594630"," There's a nice 10 point spread going on in here."
"6602820","6604360"," Fucking bears are above going. "
"6604820","6610340"," This fucking bear, I burrows up here and he's like, bares ever go and dies by die."
"6614960","6617160"," Known demand for bulls right here."
"6623800","6625460"," They're going to blood the fuck out of this. "
"6625560","6628200"," If the buyers aren't there, they're going to blood the fuck out of this."
"6635990","6637710"," Trading 61 right now."
"6640490","6643110"," Did I fucking put stops on this shit just in case?"
"6649220","6650940"," Earlier in the week, I took a trade. "
"6651520","6657420"," I had a stop loss on it and I didn't get stopped out."
"6658140","6664760"," I took the stop loss off and I had a guy here to look at a roof for me."
"6666320","6671560"," He came in my office and I was like, dude, you can't come in here. "
"6671960","6673120"," I left the stream."
"6673560","6676460"," I left the stream up and running and I left the office."
"6677520","6679400"," I got fucking rolled just like this. "
"6680060","6685120"," I got fucking rolled trying to buy one of these dips and we fucking rolled right down on it."
"6686360","6688700"," I lost 70 cents."
"6689600","6690880"," You know what's really fucked up too?"
"6691700","6696000"," At the end of the day at 4.15, I had another trade on that I made it was making"
"6696000","6696800"," a ton of money on. "
"6697980","6700580"," And I couldn't decide if I was going to close it or not."
"6701340","6707840"," So I waited until 4.15. They actually gave me two pennies on that fucking trade."
"6710800","6712100"," They gave me two cents. "
"6719500","6725660"," I'm over here trying to save fucking money in a fucking roof and I'm getting fucked on a call"
"6725660","6726080"," trade."
"6731100","6735360"," I lost pretty much all the negotiating power that I had in that fucking roof."
"6738830","6740390"," I'm trading 59 right now. "
"6740790","6742490"," 60 bounced around 57 right now."
"6759900","6760960"," Just waiting now."
"6773840","6775800"," Check the half hour velocity really quick. "
"6783050","6784390"," You see this right here?"
"6785430","6786290"," I'm feeling good here."
"6787210","6787790"," Not so bad."
"6787890","6788710"," I'm feeling pretty good here. "
"6790690","6791590"," I'm feeling good."
"6792290","6793930"," So this is a half hour candle right now."
"6795190","6796110"," So I'm long right now. "
"6796170","6796810"," I'm not selling this."
"6797090","6798290"," So you see this right?"
"6798390","6799170"," I want to show you guys this."
"6800910","6803030"," So do you see this candle right here?"
"6803490","6806930"," You see these fuckers coming right in here and buying that like it's nobody's business. "
"6807950","6810110"," Fucker's buying that shit like it's nobody's business."
"6810550","6812270"," Fucker's buying that shit like it's nobody's business."
"6813450","6816110"," You can see right here they bought that shit too right?"
"6817790","6819610"," And they're buying this right now. "
"6821510","6824750"," Now the one problem we have here is that half hour trigger."
"6825030","6826630"," So if we can get above it right?"
"6826630","6835570"," We're going to have an explosive move up here and trade 5.17. And that is what?"
"6836070","6843490"," We will trade that again 5.17.20. So this candle matters right now."
"6845950","6847190"," We have to get above. "
"6847410","6849010"," We have to get above this half hour trigger."
"6849170","6849490"," We have a choice."
"6851470","6853310"," We're going to come back in right now. "
"6855090","6856690"," I want you to see this."
"6858990","6859990"," So these buyers."
"6860430","6862190"," See how they're trying to sell this down right now?"
"6862890","6866310"," These sellers are coming in and trying to run over these buyers. "
"6866830","6870130"," So I can't lose this hourly trigger."
"6870430","6871250"," Do you guys understand me?"
"6873750","6875310"," So pay attention and we'll keep watching it."
"6876510","6877290"," But they're here. "
"6877430","6878090"," The buyers are here."
"6878190","6878650"," I'll tell you that."
"6878850","6880290"," You can see it right on the half hour. "
"6881550","6882130"," See him?"
"6883870","6884790"," You see the buyers?"
"6885750","6886570"," They're right fucking there."
"6888430","6891090"," So we'll see if they're still here with me."
"6896910","6898850"," I'm going to make some money on this trade I think. "
"6899350","6900770"," I think I'm going to get fucking rich on this trade."
"6902250","6904170"," Print me 100% here please."
"6906590","6908530"," We're going to take this trade right?"
"6910470","6912210"," Right to here. "
"6912370","6912930"," You ready for it?"
"6916110","6916930"," Right there?"
"6918070","6919030"," Right there?"
"6919970","6921750"," We're going to take that one right there."
"6926860","6929860"," The trade is dead below the hourly trigger."
"6930100","6934240"," Your stops are right there. "
"6946290","6948530"," You got the algos behind you right now."
"6948670","6949010"," Trust me."
"6950730","6952570"," Well, currently they're right here. "
"6955730","6956990"," We'll know if they leave."
"6957370","6959330"," If we get down here we're going to know that we leave."
"6963330","6965090"," I'm telling you I'm long right now. "
"6965190","6969130"," I want to anyone out there so I can see some of your trades or some of your chats."
"6971570","6975010"," So I'm telling you right now these fucking buyers are right here still."
"6975850","6978250"," I don't know how big these sellers are. "
"6978270","6978730"," I'll say that."
"6978890","6980410"," I don't know how big these sellers are here."
"6981310","6984870"," If they're huge and they start to run over the buyers down here. "
"6985110","6985930"," Yeah, I'll get out of the trade."
"6986270","6988330"," But I know the buyers are definitely here."
"6988570","6992290"," So if they get run over that's fine. "
"6992390","6993050"," I'll get out of the trade."
"6993290","6995830"," But I know they're here definitely."
"6998630","7003470"," So stops below any kind of break of any kind of break of the hourly trigger. "
"7003470","7005170"," If they blast this shit down."
"7005810","7007770"," They start doing this shit right here."
"7008370","7008810"," Run. "
"7011310","7014550"," That means your buyers are gone for the day and the bears have taken over."
"7014710","7019270"," The sellers are going to have a Friday party and blast this shit down to the depths of hell."
"7027330","7028570"," You know, bear it up. "
"7028730","7030250"," Then we'll put the bear music on for the bears."
"7038340","7039100"," Yeah, I'm long here."
"7039240","7040220"," I think the buyers are here. "
"7040520","7042000"," So I get the fuck out of it."
"7042000","7044080"," Well, I can be wrong here too, but."
"7046980","7049060"," Book map looks like they want to go slightly lower. "
"7049540","7052120"," Let's go take a look at book map with that demand down there."
"7053160","7054080"," Let's take a look at it."
"7054180","7056720"," Let's take a look at book map really quick and see if that's real or not. "
"7058180","7059320"," How do I get over there and do that?"
"7059460","7060000"," Hold on a second here."
"7063980","7067280"," Yeah, you see that right there?"
"7067420","7068440"," You see that right there?"
"7068520","7069840"," Like that's the market right there."
"7070200","7071760"," Now we could go down a little bit more. "
"7071940","7074120"," You can see at five, one, four, nine."
"7075580","7082240"," So there's a little bit more down that could go, but that's the fucking ceiling for the bulls or"
"7082240","7082780"," the floor."
"7083680","7085360"," The bulls lose that floor down there. "
"7085500","7087400"," See where that is right there, that big red bar?"
"7088260","7091640"," I'll tell you what, if we go below that, our bulls are fucked."
"7092260","7093360"," Right there, you see it?"
"7093800","7095280"," That's the first bounce right there."
"7097080","7098740"," That's the second bounce right?"
"7099780","7102680"," If the bulls lose this right, run. "
"7107900","7110140"," Yeah, that's that big old staircase down there."
"7110220","7111860"," I guess there's some more down here we could go."
"7112640","7114060"," A little bit more down there we could go. "
"7114180","7115000"," They could try to flush this."
"7115420","7115640"," Hold on."
"7116740","7118680"," I'm going to watch my trade here really quick. "
"7119720","7121220"," Five, one, three, five."
"7125830","7127390"," They might try it up."
"7127510","7131730"," They might try to fucking loop this one down like whoop and then go up. "
"7132570","7134090"," I'm staying long here regardless."
"7134290","7134890"," I'll add to the position."
"7136470","7137910"," Hold on a second here. "
"7139450","7140910"," I'm going to stay long regardless."
"7143770","7146030"," Even if they tag this down here."
"7147330","7148810"," Come down, try that bull shit. "
"7148890","7149870"," I'll just add to the position."
"7151530","7152710"," I put some risk on here."
"7152810","7153710"," I'll lose some money today with you. "
"7154650","7156290"," I'm not selling this by the way."
"7160570","7161170"," No stop."
"7161370","7163690"," My stops would be down here somewhere. "
"7170460","7171640"," I'm staying long here."
"7176820","7178100"," You guys can't see this."
"7187660","7189420"," I'm going to change that to add. "
"7191080","7192280"," No stops for me today."
"7192460","7193980"," I want to see if I can make some money."
"7198220","7199340"," Still long here. "
"7221090","7223070"," Man, they are fucking trying dude."
"7223250","7224770"," They are fucking working this shit."
"7231240","7232120"," Still long. "
"7302150","7303470"," Green again, by the way."
"7303930","7305370"," The trade is in the green right now."
"7313650","7314890"," Not selling either. "
"7315150","7319890"," I think we have a chance of one more roll down here, but I'm staying grim."
"7320190","7321650"," I'm fucking long here."
"7321830","7322710"," I'll add down here. "
"7323270","7324050"," I don't give a fuck."
"7332280","7333240"," Yeah, there you go."
"7333420","7334240"," Start printing me again. "
"7341520","7344440"," Let's go back to that 30 minute candle and see what's going on."
"7346280","7347660"," Oh, they are fucking trying."
"7347920","7349180"," Look at these guys down. "
"7349500","7350880"," These guys are mad dude."
"7353280","7357020"," The fucking battle of the fucking buyers and sellers right here."
"7358560","7359240"," That's right. "
"7359540","7359800"," Turn green."
"7362000","7365940"," There's like a giant group of fucking sellers right here."
"7367380","7370100"," The fucking giant group of fucking buyers right there. "
"7371000","7372380"," Who do you think wins this fight?"
"7372540","7373600"," Let me know in the chat right now."
"7374220","7376240"," Do you think the sellers win this or the buyers?"
"7376500","7377560"," I think the buyers win it."
"7378420","7379800"," Let me know in the chat right here. "
"7383320","7389340"," Do you think the buyers?"
"7389620","7390480"," Yeah, give me the bulls baby."
"7391420","7392780"," Bears will win today."
"7392960","7393540"," I don't think so. "
"7394860","7395820"," That's possible."
"7397140","7404780"," So in last night's market brief, I was like, if the bulls fucking make money and disappear, these"
"7404780","7407320"," fucking bears will come out and fucking eat us alive."
"7409440","7410900"," That's what they're trying right now. "
"7410900","7411600"," Well, they all goes."
"7415220","7417480"," We'll find out the buyers are still here, man."
"7417680","7419020"," If they're not, dude, right?"
"7419120","7421780"," If these sellers win here, it's fucking straight down. "
"7425940","7427120"," Thirty fucking points."
"7427200","7427700"," Steps of hell."
"7428040","7433540"," Oh, they're hungry. "
"7433740","7434420"," I know they're hungry."
"7436820","7438260"," They have every right to me too."
"7438400","7439560"," I got to be honest. "
"7440440","7441900"," If you're a bear out there, right?"
"7443500","7444340"," Talk about getting."
"7444640","7445540"," I got to watch this shit."
"7445640","7445800"," Hold on. "
"7445860","7447140"," These fuckers are still trying again."
"7448180","7448980"," He's fucking."
"7449520","7450680"," He's fucking seller. "
"7450940","7451920"," They're fucking mad, dude."
"7452140","7454660"," They're fucking like Monday, Tuesday."
"7456720","7459320"," Like, so then, so then like Tuesday clothes. "
"7459800","7460760"," Was it Tuesday or what?"
"7460920","7461960"," It was Tuesday clothes, right?"
"7462120","7462780"," Like Tuesday clothes."
"7465820","7467100"," I go and look at the fucking volume."
"7467640","7470120"," I go and look at the puts, put buying and call buying. "
"7471200","7473580"," The dude from gamma labs."
"7475140","7477200"," He's like, dude from gamma labs is like."
"7478700","7481240"," He's like, he's like, they didn't, he's like this. "
"7482460","7485560"," He's like, normally they'll sell, or normally they'll sell their puts."
"7487820","7491020"," He's like, normally they'll, they'll be selling the event, right?"
"7493180","7494060"," So here's a deal."
"7494200","7496240"," They'll close their puts right into the event. "
"7499440","7501600"," And they don't give a fuck what the event is."
"7503320","7503720"," Right?"
"7504500","7506120"," And then they fucking bought."
"7506680","7508240"," That's why we might be coming down here too. "
"7508360","7509720"," I have to probably look back on Tuesday."
"7511340","7514100"," Because they might be wanting to hit that fucking target too."
"7515140","7517220"," Whatever the Tuesday, what was the Tuesday look?"
"7517380","7517900"," I got to watch that. "
"7518040","7518660"," Hold on a second here."
"7520260","7521880"," Where the fuck is the Tuesday low?"
"7525540","7526520"," Oh, right here."
"7526800","7526860"," Right. "
"7527180","7527340"," Hold on."
"7527440","7528300"," We're going to switch over here."
"7528920","7530420"," This might be happening right now. "
"7530420","7531560"," Hold on a second here."
"7533400","7535400"," I got a, I'm going to put a stop on."
"7535540","7536100"," Hold on a second here. "
"7536260","7537540"," Because you know what could be happening here?"
"7538260","7539720"," I'm going to tell you what else happened this week."
"7541320","7545260"," Uh, okay."
"7545640","7549340"," So right here, right?"
"7550540","7551540"," See this right here?"
"7552820","7554200"," This, all this thing down here. "
"7557220","7558260"," Normally, right?"
"7558560","7558720"," Normally."
"7564220","7567640"," Sellers would have like taken the money and ran, right?"
"7569560","7572300"," They doubled down on Tuesday."
"7573440","7574940"," They drank the Kool-Aid. "
"7576160","7577180"," So like, uh."
"7580100","7582280"," So like rather than saying fuck yeah."
"7583360","7584280"," Like right here. "
"7584520","7584920"," Fuck you."
"7584960","7585620"," I'm a thing with money and run."
"7585740","7587000"," They said, no, I'm going to add. "
"7587560","7588920"," And I'm not closing them."
"7589040","7591080"," And they got fucking rammed into the clothes."
"7591720","7592400"," And that was it. "
"7592580","7593020"," Off and running."
"7593840","7595060"," Off and fucking running."
"7596300","7597020"," This is Tuesday. "
"7597100","7598620"," This is a dangerous place right here."
"7599680","7601900"," These fucking, these fucking dealers, man."
"7602020","7603700"," They'll take it right back down here again too. "
"7603860","7605460"," You know, like you'll get that."
"7605640","7607600"," You'll get the print down here, but they'll be worthless."
"7608820","7610440"," You know, like we'll come right back down here. "
"7611680","7614680"," Yeah, they did it."
"7614740","7616000"," You just didn't get paid for it."
"7616840","7620060"," So, and you can see this expansion here, right?"
"7620540","7621900"," I mean, look at this expansion here. "
"7623300","7625820"," Look at this range expansion on spoons."
"7626040","7628660"," Like this isn't expected pretty big fucking move, right?"
"7629120","7631100"," 501 down here, 500."
"7632340","7634380"," We were trading this morning, 518. "
"7635440","7636640"," So look at that down below."
"7638580","7641240"," It's a pretty, there's an expected range expansion coming."
"7641360","7642380"," I should have mentioned that this morning. "
"7642520","7643100"," I didn't."
"7647680","7648420"," Hold on here."
"7648600","7649780"," I got to be careful here because. "
"7652080","7653320"," They're going to try it."
"7653520","7655400"," They're going to try to blast this thing."
"7657340","7660340"," I might just sit on my hands and not trade this. "
"7661720","7662980"," Because they look like they're pissed."
"7674710","7675410"," That too."
"7675530","7676430"," That's on Tuesday. "
"7676910","7678330"," What they did on Tuesday was."
"7680770","7682130"," So on Tuesday, right?"
"7683110","7687230"," So, like, like clockwork every week, like clockwork."
"7687970","7688970"," Come into an event. "
"7690010","7691310"," See, they're trying to do it right now."
"7694250","7695710"," I'm actually green right now."
"7698750","7701250"," Nope, I'm down right now. "
"7702350","7703350"," I might have to sell."
"7703490","7703890"," Hold on here."
"7706710","7710210"," So, no, you can actually see it, right?"
"7710370","7712130"," We'll just start selling fucking puts, right?"
"7712710","7714690"," Like two weekend like Tuesday or Wednesday. "
"7715350","7716790"," And you'll see them sell all these puts."
"7717350","7717830"," Take their money."
"7719130","7722070"," And then we fucking rip up into the like the events are all over. "
"7722190","7724170"," And we rip up into fucking the rest of the week, right?"
"7724350","7725910"," It's like clockwork, clockwork, clockwork."
"7726690","7727570"," This fucking week."
"7729170","7730970"," That's second leg down that we got. "
"7731130","7731930"," Remember that second leg?"
"7732210","7733850"," Remember we got the second leg down?"
"7735670","7737210"," They fucking bought puts."
"7737550","7739270"," They just kept buying and buying."
"7739790","7744030"," When we were squeezing up the last 15 minutes of that, that day, they were buying through all that"
"7744030","7744590"," shit too. "
"7745430","7746850"," I'm going to get, I'm going to get stopped out here."
"7747770","7749270"," I'm going to take the L on this one again."
"7752990","7754890"," Down four pennies right now. "
"7763250","7764670"," This is it for the bulls, man."
"7765290","7766370"," Did I just stay in this trade?"
"7771640","7772280"," Probably not."
"7772760","7774500"," There's a fucking bloodbath setting up here. "
"7787650","7788970"," We got a sell order in here."
"7789390","7790330"," I'm getting the fuck out."
"7800410","7801250"," No fill yet. "
"7812130","7813970"," So, what they did on Tuesday, right?"
"7814550","7817750"," It's like Tuesday, they just kept buying puts, buying puts."
"7818210","7820130"," And they got fucking run over."
"7821090","7822530"," They drank the fucking Kool-Aid. "
"7822610","7824010"," That's second leg down on Tuesday."
"7824450","7825550"," People are just like, fuck it."
"7825770","7826230"," I'm going to roll. "
"7826390","7827610"," All these puts out of just got bank."
"7828270","7829870"," I'm going to go in there and just start buying shit."
"7830010","7830670"," I made a bunch of money. "
"7831110","7832490"," I don't care if they burn, right?"
"7832810","7833870"," That's where I'm at right now."
"7833990","7835190"," I'm like, I don't care if they fucking burn."
"7840170","7842990"," So this, I'm setting myself up to get rolled over. "
"7846630","7850390"," So this is like the inverse of the bears on Tuesday is my point."
"7854490","7855950"," Still no fill for me."
"7869570","7870790"," Oh, there I go. "
"7882950","7883630"," I'm flat."
"7884710","7885490"," I am out."
"7886970","7888990"," They took me out a second time. "
"7889290","7889870"," So look at this."
"7890130","7891510"," I was stopped out twice now."
"7896670","7897670"," I am out. "
"7898070","7898910"," Gone, baby."
"7900270","7902530"," I'm pretty fucking, I'm not bearish yet."
"7902750","7904190"," There's this little thing down here. "
"7904770","7906110"," I just got taken twice now."
"7906310","7907250"," Stopped out twice."
"7908490","7908890"," Two times. "
"7911030","7911910"," I'm done for the day."
"7912150","7912910"," No more Friday for it."
"7913030","7914490"," No more Fridays for Kathy here. "
"7914590","7914770"," I'm done."
"7915370","7917330"," I just gave up 10 cents total this morning."
"7918510","7919450"," No more for me. "
"7919770","7920150"," I've had enough."
"7920930","7923770"," I don't want to get, I don't want to get, I don't have a bad Friday."
"7924350","7930880"," Oh, no, I think the stick gets bought. "
"7931060","7934640"," I think, I think it gets bought here, but look at this shit."
"7934740","7936320"," They run me up here and be so mad."
"7939340","7940120"," Oh, dude. "
"7940360","7941160"," Dude, look at that."
"7942220","7943480"," Son of a bitch."
"7943880","7944300"," Oopsie. "
"7944440","7944640"," Sorry."
"7948840","7950160"," Watch, watch this shit."
"7950280","7951940"," Just go to the fucking moon right now. "
"7955960","7958340"," Oh, dude, I'm back up to 50 fucking cents."
"7959740","7960420"," Fuck!"
"7964620","7967380"," They went from 36 to 56 cents just then."
"7984620","7991700"," I'm long again right now for 53 cents. "
"7992420","8000100"," I'm long again."
"8001080","8002040"," God damn, dude."
"8052030","8065220"," This is"
"8065220","8066460"," my third spy trade. "
"8066700","8069980"," I've had them like turn green, but then they go red, then they turn green."
"8126910","8128970"," It's a pretty big fucking fight right here, man."
"8156850","8158810"," I'm like, try that shit one more time. "
"8158970","8161670"," Try that fucking like, try that bullshit one more time."
"8162690","8164530"," So I can add, I want to try to add right here."
"8164710","8166190"," I'm going to try to get one more tick, right?"
"8166190","8168450"," If I can get that tick, I'm going to see. "
"8174050","8175110"," Look at them all bold up again."
"8200480","8201959"," I'm about to add some more here."
"8209120","8210540"," Don't give me a little bit more. "
"8216400","8221180"," I'm trying to scrape up something that's like, or it's hitting like 43 cents and 42 cents."
"8241299","8242280"," Adding some more."
"8259459","8260840"," Long again, 516C. "
"8262480","8266100"," I've had two, one, one, not too bad."
"8267459","8268520"," One trade, though."
"8268620","8271900"," I lost 10 cents on, or 10 cents total between the two. "
"8276260","8280260"," I think we'll leave this back up here again and see if we can do this."
"8284330","8286530"," Still with the target of our one to the upside."
"8288549","8291150"," Give me some fucking money, baby. "
"8291570","8300260"," I mean, look at this shit right here."
"8301080","8303959"," I took this trade right here, right?"
"8304440","8305580"," Pound it, pound it."
"8305820","8307000"," That's stopped out here. "
"8307360","8307879"," Boom, stop."
"8310340","8312400"," Butts, I believe this one."
"8312780","8313420"," That's stopped out. "
"8313719","8314959"," No, you know, I bought this one, I think."
"8315400","8316540"," That's stopped out down here."
"8316540","8320559"," And I'm in a third spy trade, three times today. "
"8327400","8328840"," A million little cuts."
"8336450","8338870"," And I'm looking for this trade right here."
"8339170","8342549"," Wherever this trade is, I'm looking for it right there. "
"8343469","8344549"," You see it right there?"
"8364900","8366200"," Come on, bulls."
"8369799","8372080"," Let's check the half an hour as well again."
"8372080","8373219"," See what's going on with that. "
"8378490","8380850"," Look at these fucking bears, man."
"8382469","8383530"," Goddamn bears."
"8385930","8388090"," These fucking sellers are assholes. "
"8404170","8408330"," I mean, just look at this here, just like pushing it down, pushing price down."
"8411430","8413790"," They want it down here, right here is where they want it."
"8418710","8419830"," I'm just going to add today. "
"8419930","8420770"," I don't give a fuck."
"8421050","8422710"," We'll give somebody to the bear gods."
"8423870","8425290"," Don't do what I'm doing right now. "
"8431540","8433040"," I'm going to buy this shit, too."
"8433160","8434020"," You keep doing what you're doing."
"8434020","8434860"," I'm going to keep buying it. "
"8439080","8439980"," Oh, dude, nice."
"8441700","8442420"," Disney, baby."
"8449640","8451300"," I got a buy order in right now. "
"8454400","8455780"," I'm buying this shit, too."
"8455920","8456540"," I had another 10."
"8461900","8462940"," Who's this right here?"
"8464300","8465400"," Why am I getting this?"
"8471290","8475510"," I'm talking to Joe right now, and I'm telling him that I'm taking risky trades on a Friday. "
"8495800","8497500"," Watch out for this blast down."
"8497760","8501080"," Book maps got more supply down here, so be very careful."
"8507100","8508660"," It's a little bit lower here. "
"8508800","8509920"," Watch out for the blood down here."
"8510000","8510320"," You see this?"
"8510900","8512180"," We're about to get rugged down here."
"8523780","8525600"," Another 10 set up right here. "
"8525840","8527340"," This will be my last buy here."
"8527520","8531660"," If we go down there and tag that supply to the downside, I'll be adding one more time."
"8531660","8532480"," Another 10 contracts. "
"8540110","8541630"," Haven't bought anymore yet, though."
"8545510","8547470"," I'm staying in these to the end of the day today."
"8547610","8548630"," I'll hold these until the close. "
"8554350","8556430"," First two trades got stopped out."
"8556650","8558090"," This trade right here is still in it."
"8558670","8560210"," I've been adding down here, too. "
"8560350","8563510"," I've been adding for cheap money, like $0.32, stuff like that."
"8563710","8567510"," They're all at $0.40 right now, so I'm feeling pretty good here."
"8569290","8572650"," Now, don't be careful of this roll down over here. "
"8572850","8574050"," Then the move up higher."
"8576570","8578770"," I'm not believing these fucking bears, man."
"8578970","8579290"," These sellers. "
"8579610","8580090"," I don't buy them."
"8580170","8581610"," I don't believe anything they're saying right now."
"8583950","8584450"," Smoke. "
"8584550","8585570"," Smoke and mares, baby."
"8601140","8610780"," I just want a fat print."
"8611120","8613840"," Just give me a fucking $1 print. "
"8613840","8616940"," Give me like a 300% print, and I'll be happy for a Friday."
"8620900","8622320"," I'm trading 39 right now."
"8622640","8624660"," Premiums holding up slightly better than it was earlier. "
"8637690","8639930"," I'll do one more buy down here somewhere."
"8640290","8642710"," Wherever that demand, that last demand is."
"8643750","8649550"," If they start staircaseing us down, I'm going to fucking wrap it up, but it's the last trade of the"
"8649550","8649750"," day. "
"8651350","8652730"," Three times the charm, baby."
"8654110","8655030"," A bunch of cuts."
"8664320","8666460"," I'll add 10 more here if I have to. "
"8667660","8669440"," Right down here at the bottom of the screen."
"8676580","8678040"," I'm trading 42 right now."
"8683740","8684460"," I've been green. "
"8684780","8686780"," The first two trades, I was green on both of them."
"8687520","8688640"," So it's like I'm not making money."
"8690480","8691380"," It's getting fucking. "
"8691560","8693200"," I'm getting torn up in here."
"8693480","8696960"," All this shit in here is getting me torn the fuck up down here."
"8708150","8708630"," 516. "
"8709230","8713150"," Have a target to the upside right now of at least 51720."
"8713990","8721450"," I'm still of the, I still think we might trade 520 today."
"8722390","8723110"," I think it's possible. "
"8727450","8728490"," How high do we get?"
"8729650","8731490"," Yeah, we took the target out for today."
"8735200","8738080"," So you guys want to see, you guys want to see the target was for today?"
"8739420","8740800"," We took it out this morning."
"8742080","8742740"," Hold on here. "
"8742820","8745180"," I'll show you guys the market brief from last night."
"8749320","8750320"," Hang tight here."
"8755460","8756660"," Let's go to trade the trigger. "
"8760480","8762560"," So we actually hit our target this morning."
"8775630","8779050"," Let's check out the, let's check out the dashboard really quick."
"8785670","8788890"," So let's take a look at, so we're going to go to the dashboard. "
"8790530","8793330"," And this is the supporter level market update."
"8793330","8798790"," And you can see the spy chart right here."
"8800350","8803970"," We had morning weakness that it would be bought. "
"8804370","8806370"," And then we would trade this 518."
"8807750","8809370"," And that's right where we traded."
"8809870","8814110"," We actually traded, if you look closely, it's below 518 right here. "
"8814810","8816590"," And this yellow box was the target."
"8818150","8826090"," So I mean, if you look at, if you look at, um, the morning here, we kind of did what"
"8826090","8827290"," we were supposed to do, right?"
"8828450","8830330"," So here, let me go back to the main screen."
"8838620","8842380"," And you can see the trade right here. "
"8844560","8846240"," So we came down into this morning."
"8846400","8847620"," We hit our hourly trigger."
"8848620","8850280"," And we traded right up there. "
"8850800","8851280"," And we tagged."
"8852580","8855400"," So I had it at about 517 and changed."
"8855400","8857940"," We went directly up and tagged 518. "
"8859420","8862700"," So this is what I'm hoping for is some kind of a retrace up here."
"8865160","8868400"," Then they can try to sell this back down again and blood us down here."
"8870720","8874280"," Uh, but you know, like, like in here, it's dangerous, right?"
"8874620","8877080"," If they have reversed this down, we start blasting down. "
"8877180","8877860"," Maybe it's right there."
"8880500","8882420"," My real fear here though is this."
"8882880","8883880"," This is where it gets sketchy. "
"8883880","8885580"," You have the move down, right?"
"8886980","8890940"," And they start to form like a, like a resistance level right here."
"8893120","8895280"," So this becomes resistance, right?"
"8896860","8899960"," And you'll have like a, oh, I'm trying to get up."
"8900740","8902920"," And the sellers are just right fucking here, right?"
"8903180","8904760"," This is actually where they are right there. "
"8905800","8907020"," And then we just get blooded."
"8912360","8914440"," But I like the structure is all good structure."
"8915080","8916260"," It's all turning around. "
"8919400","8920400"," Leave it right there."
"8920500","8922160"," We'll keep moving it over, moving it over."
"8924900","8927020"," I'm hoping we can retrace all of this. "
"8927240","8928320"," I would, I'll be honest with you."
"8929900","8931940"," I want to see this fucking thing right here."
"8932340","8932360"," Bam. "
"8932860","8934100"," And then that to the close."
"8934860","8936740"," I doubt we get that though now that I'm looking at it."
"8937460","8939380"," That would piss off some people, wouldn't it?"
"8939540","8941220"," Like on a Friday, it's already 1217. "
"8941600","8943460"," I doubt you can get that on 1217."
"8943460","8945500"," Like by four p.m., come on."
"8947160","8949440"," After the Joe Biden, come on shit. "
"8956560","8958460"," Let's probably draw that better too."
"8959980","8968430"," It would be to right there."
"8975190","8976890"," And that ain't looking too good, is it?"
"8979410","8981710"," They're going to take this fucker out is what they're going to do. "
"8984690","8986670"," Is that better like that or no?"
"8987430","8991030"," I guess that would come back down, wouldn't it?"
"8992930","8994130"," If you could even get it."
"8995830","8996950"," It's a lot of work, dude."
"8997070","8998070"," You see how much work that is?"
"8998850","8999610"," I don't know. "
"9001410","9002050"," Oh, no."
"9002270","9003330"," I'm kind of suspect myself."
"9009360","9010400"," Time is that dude. "
"9010700","9013200"," That's 145 in the afternoon, right?"
"9013640","9014420"," Two o'clock."
"9015440","9019360"," Reversal, 2 p.m. I don't know, man."
"9021540","9023880"," This looks better to give it to the sellers, doesn't it?"
"9025520","9026680"," Something like that, isn't it?"
"9028060","9031940"," Where's 2 p.m.? Oh, that's 130. "
"9032380","9032840"," Where's 130?"
"9033060","9034200"," That's where they set that shit up."
"9037080","9038320"," Yeah, I don't know, dude."
"9038540","9040600"," I don't know if it, I don't know if it pulls have time here. "
"9050480","9052360"," I might have to wrap this shit up."
"9060810","9063570"," These fucking sellers want it bad, don't they?"
"9065150","9066810"," Revenge, revenge, revenge."
"9067390","9068370"," They want their Friday revenge. "
"9075800","9077920"," We're losing the hour right now, too."
"9078560","9080980"," Now, this hourly trigger is going to begin to turn down here."
"9082160","9084280"," How many candles do we have that are red?"
"9087360","9089480"," One, two, that's one hour. "
"9089840","9095600"," If the bulls lose this hour here, and you get that third candle, you're going to get a flat hourly"
"9095600","9097760"," trigger, a neutral hourly trigger."
"9099900","9101620"," This is kind of it for the bulls, man."
"9103540","9104600"," Come on, bulls. "
"9108880","9113520"," You got like a, we got like, we're not quite, we're not quite bearish at, but it's getting close."
"9115300","9116500"," It's getting really close."
"9122270","9124190"," Hey, figured out money, what's going on?"
"9127190","9129050"," I'm trying to buy a dip, man. "
"9131310","9132350"," What's going on, Mike?"
"9133630","9135130"," I'm trying to buy a dip, dude."
"9135130","9136590"," It's like the last dip of the week."
"9138170","9139630"," And I shouldn't be doing that. "
"9143430","9145630"," There's not enough time left in the day, brother."
"9147070","9150150"," I'm like, I don't think the bulls have a lot of time between now and four."
"9156930","9158390"," We're flattening right now, man. "
"9158530","9159530"," We're in the hourly trigger, brother."
"9162490","9164790"," Yeah, don't put, there's nothing worth trading today, man."
"9165810","9167670"," There's nothing worth trading today. "
"9167890","9173370"," I told people, so hey, Mike, last night I was like, look, I was like, if we go up on"
"9173370","9178130"," that open, the bulls are going to leave, they were like, wrap it up, take a Friday off half day"
"9178130","9178650"," and they're done."
"9179610","9183050"," And you're going to get sellers coming in and just start, start reeling this thing down."
"9183250","9184510"," And that's exactly what they did, dude. "
"9185470","9186570"," They just started reeling it down."
"9189830","9192590"," So, of course, I'm like, ah, hey, Mike."
"9193990","9196810"," So I didn't get to buy the clothes yesterday either. "
"9196890","9200710"," I was always here with David AMS in a trader podcast."
"9201530","9205430"," And they blasted down into the hourly trigger yesterday, brother."
"9206130","9210410"," Like 416, like one minute too late to take the trade. "
"9211250","9214510"," So I couldn't take the trade into the clothes for the open this morning."
"9214510","9216250"," And then I'm like, yeah, we're going to go up to 480."
"9216930","9219030"," So we go up there and then they start selling it. "
"9219130","9220870"," And I'm like, yeah, I'll look for a dip to buy."
"9221450","9223910"," And I've been cut up twice now, like twice."
"9224210","9228190"," I've taken two, two stops and now I'm in for the third time. "
"9229070","9230970"," And I'm like, ah, this is the last time."
"9231070","9233510"," I think I should just wrap this up and come back on Monday."
"9242870","9244690"," Yeah, that's, that's what I'm saying. "
"9244890","9248630"," Oh, it's not even, it's not even like, I'm not even really concerned with it right now."
"9249630","9251230"," But I'm trying, I'm over trading."
"9251490","9253450"," It's Friday and I'm like, what am I doing here?"
"9255430","9259110"," Like I have no business being here on a Friday trying to pick up some zero dates. "
"9265570","9267990"," So I'm probably going to get stopped out here."
"9268850","9272050"," Maybe I should leave the stream up and come with you, man."
"9272710","9275610"," I'll come hang out, love a beer or something after you put the baby down. "
"9275610","9278030"," Just sit outside and enjoy the sun."
"9280090","9282510"," We were just talking about you a few minutes ago too brother."
"9284990","9287530"," We were just, we were just chatting about you not too long ago. "
"9287830","9288910"," We're talking about how much we love you."
"9289650","9290190"," To be honest."
"9296280","9296680"," Right?"
"9297120","9297740"," Put the baby down. "
"9297920","9298220"," It's Friday."
"9299320","9300560"," Go outside in the rocking chair."
"9300840","9302960"," Hang out under the porch and stuff. "
"9304220","9306240"," Have the dog come out and hang outside with you."
"9306340","9307220"," Bring the kitty cat outside."
"9308740","9310280"," Spring time, summer time. "
"9312840","9314980"," Hey, are you, let me ask you a question now, Mike."
"9317200","9317960"," Are you."
"9319520","9324840"," I think I'm going to be more hands off as the end of quarter comes. "
"9326980","9329560"," I don't like a lot of the stuff coming down the pike."
"9332360","9336020"," I keep looking at a bunch of stuff happening next week, week after."
"9336020","9339360"," I'm like, man, I don't even know if I want to have an exposure in the market. "
"9340300","9341600"," Are you feeling that or no?"
"9344040","9344980"," I'm feeling that."
"9347020","9348720"," They're going to try to blood it right now."
"9349540","9350360"," Be really careful. "
"9350600","9352220"," You see that level down below in book map."
"9352860","9354040"," We're going to lose it right now."
"9355280","9356820"," They're coming right down here for it. "
"9360080","9361820"," Buyers leaving the market right now."
"9369090","9369650"," 5135."
"9378380","9380660"," I can't read what you guys are saying here. "
"9380840","9380980"," Hold on."
"9382300","9383400"," I'm getting old guys."
"9389390","9392490"," Markowitz would say in a VIX cloud turning green. "
"9393530","9395270"," Seems like more VIX upside possible."
"9396270","9401830"," So we should get an increase in volatility regardless of price the next couple of weeks."
"9403210","9405590"," So yeah, I expect that too. "
"9405590","9412330"," I think the low in the VIX is this morning and then we climb from here."
"9413490","9420250"," Or the expectation is that we climb into the next nine days of going up on the VIX."
"9423830","9425150"," Yeah, that's where I'm at too. "
"9425190","9426170"," That's where I'm at too, brother."
"9435510","9437670"," Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, figuring out money."
"9437990","9440630"," I was thinking the same thing, Mike. "
"9441550","9446150"," So I've got like things will get more difficult."
"9446530","9449130"," Like the volatility is going to increase without a doubt."
"9450650","9454290"," And the easy trade from the beginning of the corner is over. "
"9454890","9455930"," I think I think it's over."
"9456830","9459970"," I think we're going into a hot even if we go up, it's going to be high volatility."
"9460830","9464870"," It's going to be like look for the stretch like look for the big sweeps down below. "
"9464990","9469050"," Look for the big gaps to fill regardless if we go up or not."
"9469050","9473230"," So I think trading is going to be brutal the next two, three weeks."
"9474410","9476010"," I've got, I still have exposure. "
"9476630","9479530"," I've got a, they got exposure to Apple right now long."
"9481670","9483850"," And I've got some, I've got a small ticker."
"9483950","9486530"," I'm not going to say it on stream because it's a low float. "
"9487630","9491910"," I don't want to pump it here or anything like that, but I do have some, a little bit of"
"9491910","9492270"," exposure."
"9494370","9498550"," Like it's not that much money, but then I've got a hedge on the market too."
"9499430","9500930"," Or the 28th. "
"9501410","9502430"," I do have some protection."
"9503930","9508850"," But other than that, I think, I think they're going to cut up a lot of these, uh, the foamables"
"9508850","9509430"," and stuff."
"9509570","9514490"," And they're going to get cut, cut the pieces as we get closer and closer to end of month to"
"9514490","9514930"," end of quarter. "
"9520640","9521860"," I think I'm with you, Mike."
"9526960","9529560"," Hey, Mike, Saturday or Sunday."
"9529780","9531020"," Do you mind if I send you a DM?"
"9531020","9535760"," And chat, maybe you have a chat or something if you had some free time?"
"9537760","9540280"," I probably shouldn't be asking that on stream, should I?"
"9542220","9543760"," How would I just send you a DM?"
"9545420","9548320"," In whatever you have time because I know you're very busy right now. "
"9551980","9553680"," Yeah, I'm, I'm long right here, guys."
"9554340","9554700"," I'm long."
"9558480","9558960"," Oh, cool, man. "
"9559080","9560140"," Yeah, I'll call you brother."
"9560140","9561400"," I'll send you myself."
"9563460","9567120"," And I'd really, Mike, I would be honest with you, Mike. "
"9567480","9575380"," I would love to sit down and just not on a trading day, like a Saturday or something or Sunday."
"9576500","9581740"," And either record an interview where I give you, I'll give them to you first, of course and stuff."
"9582040","9589320"," But I would love to do just a sit down, relaxed, um, ask you cool questions and stuff, you know?"
"9589320","9598520"," How did you get into the stock market, easy stuff, just more like, I was trying to explain it on"
"9598520","9602520"," stream recently, but more like just a conversation, I guess. "
"9604480","9609760"," Something like less or more relaxed than we're trying to find trades and all that kind of stuff and"
"9609760","9613120"," are giving a market update or stuff, stuff like that."
"9614500","9617520"," If you're ever interested in that, man, I'm going to shoot you a DM."
"9617640","9618000"," We'll talk. "
"9620060","9621020"," Yeah, me too, man."
"9621120","9621740"," I like it too, brother."
"9622240","9622760"," I do too, man. "
"9624960","9630780"," I was thinking about the same thing for like Jedi Marcus and we did it with a volatility wisdom and"
"9630780","9635180"," it's really nice to find out who people are."
"9635180","9642620"," I think I think it puts a face to who people are in another, like another context."
"9643220","9644540"," Like, oh, that's a real human being. "
"9644680","9651020"," It's not just some, you know, it's not just some guy on Twitter or YouTube or whatever."
"9651840","9654300"," You become a human, you know?"
"9655080","9656720"," And you already do that anyways."
"9657540","9662720"," I already know that you're very, uh, I always, well, I always liked, well, one of the parts of what"
"9662720","9667620"," I always liked about you would be, you like sitting there and your puppy would come up and it's"
"9667620","9669200"," very nice and welcoming and comfortable. "
"9670420","9674220"," So you already have that humanness about you, humane, humanness, all that kind of stuff."
"9676860","9678780"," I mean, like, uh, I don't mean like human."
"9678980","9684080"," I mean, like, um, humane, maybe, like, uh, like you can tell Mike's a nice guy, right?"
"9684340","9686380"," You guys can all tell all that other Mike's a nice guy. "
"9688400","9689800"," I'd hang out with him in real life."
"9690600","9692300"," He looks like you'd have a fun time."
"9696680","9698120"," I was like, you want to go play some soccer?"
"9698300","9699480"," You're like, yeah, let's go play some soccer. "
"9699640","9700200"," You want to go surfing?"
"9700440","9701360"," Yeah, yeah, I'll go surfing."
"9702260","9703040"," You want to go skiing?"
"9703260","9703340"," Yeah."
"9705840","9706980"," Am I wrong in this?"
"9709520","9712860"," I'm going to bet here that Mike is like a cool guy to hang out with. "
"9714820","9715460"," Yeah, absolutely."
"9716080","9716360"," Absolutely."
"9717700","9720180"," I like you got to have those people in your life, right?"
"9720840","9723600"," You don't want to be hanging around people that aren't, uh, they're miserable. "
"9724180","9725960"," You want to hang around people that are having a good time?"
"9726420","9727960"," You can always point them out too, right?"
"9728360","9731600"," You go somewhere and you're like, uh, I'm with my friend here."
"9731600","9732920"," He's my long term friend."
"9732940","9733700"," I grew up with him. "
"9733780","9734900"," I can't say no to him."
"9736720","9741840"," And, uh, then you like see that group of people and you're like, see those guys over there?"
"9742040","9742600"," They're always happy."
"9742840","9743060"," Look at them. "
"9743140","9744120"," They don't even care what's going on."
"9744200","9744860"," They're just having a good time."
"9744860","9746220"," I want to hang with those guys. "
"9746920","9748860"," That's, that's what Mike reminds me of."
"9754180","9755200"," So you're a boy, Zuck?"
"9756640","9761240"," Do you think Zuckerberg, I think Zuck might be a good, I don't know like they portray him."
"9761380","9764640"," I get the whole like joke about him being the lizard gang and all that. "
"9764740","9767620"," And he seems like he'd be hard to hang out with."
"9768460","9769600"," Tell me if I'm wrong on that."
"9769820","9771220"," Does anybody know any stories about Zuckerberg?"
"9772960","9774980"," He seems like he'd be right to hang out. "
"9775080","9777180"," He's out there surfing out in Hawaii and stuff."
"9777600","9779720"," He's got all this land and stuff out there."
"9782180","9783660"," Mike's in general are pretty cool. "
"9795540","9798200"," Yeah, I like, I want to hang out with Mike."
"9800640","9801680"," Making katanas."
"9809730","9814430"," Yeah, I like, um, I don't like to hang out with people that have bad times. "
"9814570","9815650"," I always like to have a good time."
"9820010","9821730"," Come on, turn baby, turn."
"9823970","9825410"," No, I, oh, you, I did. "
"9825930","9828250"," I did see, I did, no, now I get the katanas."
"9828730","9829850"," Now I get the katanas."
"9830450","9832750"," But you know what, he does MMA too, right?"
"9833090","9834150"," Didn't he call Elon out?"
"9834630","9837090"," Wasn't he like any fucking time you want to do this?"
"9837210","9837510"," Let me know. "
"9844250","9845350"," Come on, bulls."
"9847490","9849410"," I think he even called out Elon."
"9849750","9850590"," He did, didn't he?"
"9851550","9853990"," He's like, I actually trained if you ever want to mess around. "
"9856930","9858850"," You know, Elon couldn't train."
"9859190","9865110"," You can tell Elon is like, you can, I'm going to leave this over to the side right there."
"9865230","9866270"," Okay, so you can see it. "
"9868290","9870990"," We'll leave that right there for you, for you bulls out there."
"9871210","9871750"," I am long."
"9874870","9879190"," You know what, you know, I just saw a new video or picture of Elon's brother. "
"9879490","9881630"," He looks like he's doing physically well."
"9883210","9890510"," Elon's not looking as, um, Elon's not looking as, like his, his health is not as good."
"9891170","9891910"," He needs to go for a run. "
"9892750","9894050"," He needs to go for a run."
"9895890","9897470"," And I'm a tassel fanboy."
"9897670","9900850"," So, yeah, he's a goofy looking guy. "
"9900990","9902070"," He looks good though right now."
"9902710","9906570"," I don't know if he's taking the weight loss pills that everybody takes or if he's working out, but"
"9906570","9907230"," he looks pretty good."
"9909830","9911850"," Is that what it is back in the bad neck problems?"
"9912450","9912810"," Okay. "
"9913050","9916770"," Yeah, I think I heard he said he had, or was it neck or is it back?"
"9920200","9921780"," You get a bear with Elon?"
"9922180","9922960"," Yeah, I get a bear with Elon."
"9923640","9928000"," I think Zuck though, I think Zuck might be, I can't tell if he's a cool guy."
"9928920","9932640"," I know, I know we like, we like to make fun of him and stuff like that, but I think"
"9932640","9934200"," Zuck's probably a cool guy. "
"9936460","9937500"," Oh, bear with Kimball?"
"9937800","9939560"," Dude, Kimball you can tell would like to party."
"9940920","9943720"," So, all right, so I've never met Kimball."
"9943920","9944020"," Okay. "
"9944980","9955820"," But I, so I used to go to Burning Man all the time in like 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009."
"9956800","9958500"," So the Burning Man, right?"
"9958700","9962360"," During Occupy Wall Street, all those guys were hanging out there."
"9962540","9964420"," I never got to meet him, but I heard crazy stories. "
"9965520","9970060"," I never met a, I've seen Zuck before, but I've never interacted with him."
"9970820","9974340"," But I've never, I've never known, never claimed to know him or anything like that, but I've seen"
"9974340","9975800"," him at the burn."
"9976620","9980400"," I've heard that Elon was in the vicinity, but I never met him. "
"9982360","9985040"," I do have family that works for Elon."
"9987020","9987900"," That is true."
"9991640","9992860"," Wasn't he an Epstein stuff?"
"9993100","9993480"," I don't know. "
"9993800","9995240"," I don't know if he was or wasn't."
"9995740","9997800"," But like Epstein knew everybody, didn't he?"
"9998660","10001460"," Wasn't Epstein like a people-matcher, right?"
"10001800","10008000"," From what I, from what I was told about Epstein, which is very similar to Elon."
"10009140","10011120"," All right, so here we take guys some fun stories. "
"10011760","10012820"," You guys have some fun stories?"
"10015060","10017960"," So I'm friends with some people."
"10018520","10024160"," One guy I'm friends with, he's the, he's one of the heirs to Procter & Gamble."
"10024160","10027820"," And he's old money. "
"10028000","10028460"," He's very wealthy."
"10029380","10032660"," He doesn't need anything."
"10033380","10035820"," He doesn't need anything in life. "
"10036980","10037760"," And we're buddies."
"10039000","10042620"," And I didn't know he was an heir to Procter & Gamble."
"10043780","10044960"," I'm gonna try a fun story here. "
"10045380","10046600"," So this is actually a fun story."
"10047340","10048480"," So this guy is my friend."
"10049040","10051480"," And over time, so I moved to Michigan. "
"10052440","10060440"," You guys may or may not know this, but Michigan is home to like another group of Nantucket Red"
"10060440","10060780"," Wealth."
"10061420","10064000"," It's like Boston and New York, Connecticut."
"10064920","10067600"," I shouldn't do the shake, but like Connecticut has that money. "
"10067600","10070900"," And just that, those people."
"10071300","10079620"," Michigan has an old world like Dow Jones Wealth in a place called Bloomfield and Bloomfield Hills."
"10080920","10082620"," Now these guys have houses everywhere. "
"10082920","10083520"," They have houses everywhere."
"10083940","10084380"," All over the place."
"10084920","10085600"," All over the world. "
"10086080","10086840"," Like 20, 30 homes."
"10087460","10088420"," They have homes in New York, Connecticut."
"10088860","10090200"," They have homes in Vale, Aspen. "
"10090660","10092720"," They have homes in Switzerland, places like that."
"10092720","10093980"," These people are very wealthy."
"10095120","10096420"," And I ended up meeting this guy. "
"10096700","10098300"," And this guy drove the kid you not."
"10098420","10100760"," So let me say, I don't want to say his name."
"10101760","10105580"," So I met this guy, how long did I meet him?"
"10106060","10108340"," 2017, I met him. "
"10109800","10110960"," And we became friends."
"10112160","10119720"," He drives a like a 2000 Bronco."
"10120420","10122300"," I'll show you not something like a Bronco. "
"10123080","10124180"," He drives that."
"10124540","10125920"," He drives like an old beater."
"10126760","10128360"," Now he lives in a mansion. "
"10128580","10130340"," He's got a mansion right in Bloomfield."
"10130700","10131420"," He's got a mansion."
"10132240","10136500"," His mansion is like an older mansion. "
"10137840","10140840"," So like you'll, like around his, around his home."
"10141820","10145740"," Like new money moves in and they like burned down the mansion, build new."
"10146000","10147000"," It gets gaudy. "
"10147180","10149120"," It's like a stupid, beautiful."
"10152180","10153660"," Sorry, I'm trying to watch this trade."
"10153860","10155280"," I don't want to get, I don't want to get trapped here. "
"10156120","10157900"," But it's like gaudy, stupid, beautiful."
"10158280","10160940"," And his neighbors are new money."
"10162340","10164100"," No, this is going to cool story. "
"10164620","10171260"," So at that time, I didn't know that my buddy was who he is."
"10172560","10175360"," I knew he was wealthy, but his mansion was old."
"10176260","10177840"," His truck was really old. "
"10177840","10181360"," And he's a, he has a job."
"10182080","10182980"," This is where it gets crazy."
"10184380","10192620"," He's, he's an heir to a fortune, but he's required to work a job. "
"10193700","10195620"," So he has an actual profession."
"10196940","10199880"," And so I always thought that he was in this profession."
"10200280","10200580"," Like he. "
"10200580","10205060"," He sell actually, actually, I don't know if I can say or not say."
"10205480","10209800"," So like, so he sells, he's like a very expensive medical equipment."
"10211000","10215940"," These are things that cost like a million, two million dollars, big machine. "
"10216540","10222280"," So I'm like, oh, he's wealthy because he sells medical equipment, must get, make great commissions,"
"10223020","10223360"," makes bank."
"10225220","10227720"," But at the time, I had no idea who he was, right?"
"10227960","10229120"," But he drives this old beater."
"10229260","10231240"," Has a nice mansion lives in Bloomfield. "
"10231800","10233000"," You know, guys doing pretty well."
"10237460","10242210"," So he's like, Jim, I gotta go out and take a phone call."
"10242490","10242810"," I'm outside. "
"10243130","10243310"," We're outside."
"10243750","10245050"," It's a big driver on yard, right?"
"10245130","10246230"," We're outside hanging out and stuff."
"10246390","10249210"," And Tim and I, he's like looking at a take call, be right back. "
"10249490","10250870"," So he goes inside his home."
"10252270","10256570"," And I'm outside in his last state's yard or whatever."
"10257290","10263390"," And one of his neighbors, one of his neighbors, those neighbors got like. "
"10263970","10268230"," I don't know, like hand, hand carved stone driveway."

"10273570","10278490"," He's literally, he's literally got like five cars outside lambos. "
"10278770","10279310"," You name it."
"10279430","10279950"," He's got everything."
"10279950","10281830"," This guy's filthy rich. "
"10282930","10285570"," And he's slick looking like New York slick looking."
"10286770","10289950"," So he's, he sees me and he's like, Hey man, come on over."
"10290730","10295310"," So I walked down the driveway right across the road and I walk up into his estate. "
"10297190","10298390"," And he's like, Hey man."
"10299890","10302470"," He's like, he's like, he's like, who are you?"
"10302710","10303970"," You live there?"
"10304130","10305290"," Is he part of the family?"
"10305410","10305910"," He's like, who are you?"
"10305970","10307350"," And I'm like, oh, no, it's just my buddy."
"10310350","10311250"," He's like, that's your buddy. "
"10311390","10311810"," I go, yeah."
"10314490","10317210"," And he goes, he goes, what's going on over there?"
"10317270","10320070"," He's like, what, why is the house look the way that it does?"
"10320930","10321910"," And I was like, I don't know."
"10323350","10324410"," I was like, I don't know. "
"10327610","10329450"," I was like, why should I look any better?"
"10329850","10332430"," And this guy's like, you know, like his place looks beautiful."
"10333430","10334790"," And my buddy's house doesn't look as good."
"10335790","10338230"," He goes, he goes, why, why not?"
"10338470","10339750"," And I go, I go, yeah, why not?"
"10339930","10342290"," He goes, he goes, do you know that guy is?"
"10343050","10344690"," And I was like, yeah, say his name. "
"10346070","10350490"," And he goes, that guy is the heir to Procter and Gamble."
"10352250","10353990"," And I go, what did you say to me?"
"10354610","10356570"," He's like, that's the heir to Procter and Gamble."
"10356890","10358630"," Your buddy is the heir to Procter and Gamble. "
"10358830","10360530"," And I'm like, get the fuck out of here."
"10360610","10361650"," He's like, I'm telling you."
"10364090","10366690"," He's like, why doesn't he keep his house nice?"
"10367370","10369490"," This guy's got more money than the earth. "
"10370550","10371550"," And I was like, I don't know."
"10371830","10372770"," I was like, I just met him."
"10372830","10374670"," He just moved to Michigan with friends hanging out. "
"10375650","10377030"," And he's like, he never told you."
"10377090","10377650"," I was like, no."
"10377950","10379250"," And he's like laughing at me. "
"10379510","10381390"," This neighbor is like giggling laughing."
"10385550","10391170"," So he said, he goes, well, I probably shouldn't have told you and you probably shouldn't bring it"
"10391170","10391710"," up to him."
"10392750","10398050"," Now, I don't know if he was trying to set me up for piss off my buddy. "
"10398710","10404650"," And so I didn't say anything."
"10405530","10406590"," I didn't say a word."
"10407110","10410350"," Now my buddy came outside and he saw me talking to the neighbor. "
"10412210","10415430"," And he started like trash talking."
"10415590","10417050"," He's like, it's all fucking new money."
"10417430","10418610"," He's like, they come and they go. "
"10419390","10420970"," So he said that."
"10422930","10424250"," And I was like, OK, Chris."
"10424630","10425030"," Oh, shit. "
"10425290","10425790"," I just said his name."
"10426030","10426170"," Fuck."
"10426570","10430810"," So God damn it. "
"10437650","10438950"," Fuck."
"10440650","10442190"," So I go."
"10442910","10444170"," Don't say that. "
"10450500","10451800"," So."
"10451800","10451880"," I don't know."
"10460480","10460960"," So. "
"10461100","10467340"," So I don't say a word."
"10469760","10473800"," And like time passes and I'm like downstairs."
"10474300","10475260"," He's got a big walk out. "
"10475440","10476660"," He's got a big walk out thing."
"10476660","10482200"," And I realized and we're hanging out down and it's like walk out base when he says like big fucking"
"10482200","10483020"," pull up back."
"10483100","10486860"," He's got big fucking gardens in his backyard is banging. "
"10487720","10490800"," So I'm downstairs and I realized that the laundry room."
"10491880","10495160"," I like look in the laundry room and what do I see in the laundry room?"
"10495240","10499260"," He's got like everything like the first soap boxes, the first soaps."
"10499260","10505520"," Like a whole like this whole thing in there and I'm checking it out and I'm like Chris, what is"
"10505520","10506080"," this man?"
"10506580","10507200"," Oh, shit. "
"10507320","10507680"," I said again."
"10507940","10508080"," Fuck."
"10508720","10509120"," Goddamn. "
"10509500","10512880"," The last time I'm going to say I'm going to stop with the names."
"10514880","10518040"," And he told me he's like told me who he was and all that stuff."
"10518360","10523240"," And whatever I realized, my point here is what I realized was this guy didn't care. "
"10523240","10529860"," This guy didn't want to be known or liked or anyone to like him for anything like that."
"10529980","10531580"," He just want to be a regular guy is my point."
"10532240","10537040"," He had a regular job or has or time did and I really like this guy. "
"10537480","10540320"," You know, truly, even to this day, like I like him a lot."
"10541160","10548520"," But what I found fascinating was my point here is that guys like the Elon Musk, right?"
"10550860","10556240"," I'm assuming that a lot of these guys that have a lot of wealth out there like life changing"
"10556240","10556620"," forever."
"10557360","10561380"," You know, like he'll like Elon Musk likely going to be rich for generation after generation of"
"10561380","10561620"," generation. "
"10562360","10564440"," Even if even if Tesla goes away."
"10565620","10571100"," My point here though is the reason this long-ass story all comes back to one thing, which is a"
"10571100","10576380"," lot of these guys or women or whoever they want to touch grass."
"10577200","10580020"," You know, and they can't any other way. "
"10580140","10580860"," They have money."
"10581140","10581640"," They have fame."
"10582100","10582640"," They have power. "
"10583040","10585120"," They have everything that everything they could ever want."
"10585860","10586940"," I see it with Elon."
"10587280","10589040"," I'm going to get fucking stopped out here, dude. "
"10589160","10590160"," Here we go to the downside."
"10591220","10591900"," Here comes the blood."
"10596680","10597560"," So stupid. "
"10598360","10600220"," I should never be in this trade right now."
"10601760","10603960"," They're trying to blood this down and take out that."
"10603960","10605480"," They're trying to take out right now. "
"10607580","10608840"," Five, one, three, five."
"10609400","10609720"," So."
"10613300","10618120"," My point here is that it's hard for someone. "
"10618540","10619980"," It's not hard to be rich, right?"
"10620100","10620280"," It's easy."
"10621460","10625280"," But they have no way like a lot of rich people don't have normal lives."
"10626720","10629620"," So they just want to be one of the guys, one of the girls, one of the one of the"
"10629620","10632500"," days, the Dems, and I don't know how they find that. "
"10632500","10636600"," So I guess my point I'm trying to make here is I bet that Elon's brother is like that."
"10637520","10639280"," I bet Elon's brother is like that."
"10639460","10641200"," And here's the here's the crazy part. "
"10642880","10643760"," So Epstein."
"10645420","10646980"," From like Epstein's island."
"10647600","10650440"," Now, I realize that he was a monster. "
"10651720","10652500"," I get it."
"10653060","10662300"," I get that he was a monster and it was disgusting what he did."
"10664320","10671020"," What's really fucked up though about Epstein was he ends up dragging everybody in because what he"
"10671020","10671540"," would do. "
"10672380","10676120"," The disgusting thing that he would do, he didn't have a lot of friends."
"10677360","10679720"," So he would go out and collect people, right?"
"10680040","10685000"," That were smart people or people of fame, but no money."
"10685320","10686940"," And then he would put them together with people of money. "
"10687720","10689760"," And they do meet and greets, right?"
"10690500","10691160"," Is that what he did?"
"10692220","10693340"," So he'd like put rich."
"10693540","10696800"," So he was a matchmaker of like out of touch."
"10698620","10704260"," Wealthy people with, you know, like this guy's, this guy's, he said he's black holes. "
"10705500","10712060"," And so they'd like, he put together a wealthy person with someone that might be a scientist or be a"
"10712060","10715970"," maverick of some industry, but not particularly particularly."
"10717310","10718990"," Famous and stuff like that."
"10719250","10719430"," So. "
"10721370","10726050"," I guess the point I'm trying to make there is that that stuff is real."
"10727830","10732350"," That sometimes people get caught in that dragnet, that Epstein Island shit."
"10733190","10736350"," So I don't know that everybody was really a part of that Epstein Island stuff. "
"10736470","10738450"," I realized the conspiracy theories around it."
"10738450","10742030"," But I think that it's gross that or he used that."
"10742370","10749610"," He used that knowledge that other wealthy people that don't have normal lives, but he could connect"
"10749610","10750330"," those people. "
"10755560","10757720"," What he likes about other people enjoy his stuff."
"10757940","10761700"," I think he had gotten past the point where owning things made him happy, but he loved watching how"
"10761700","10762860"," happy it made other people."
"10763260","10764560"," Yeah, and I don't know whatever. "
"10764840","10766240"," I don't know what rich people."
"10766660","10768880"," I guess they would all have their own thing, right?"
"10768880","10771960"," Like some like to look lavish."
"10772000","10774580"," Some want to drive Lamborghinis. "
"10774980","10778420"," Some of them want to be normal as possible."
"10779260","10786800"," Some want to, yeah, like a meat of scientists or someone to fly jets or whatever it is they want"
"10786800","10787580"," to go to space."
"10790460","10793820"," So I think it matters or I think it depends on who they are. "
"10795840","10797940"," Am I rich from my trades?"
"10798740","10800620"," I have a wife and two daughters."
"10801580","10803060"," I own three homes."
"10803620","10805060"," I live in Detroit, Michigan. "
"10806580","10809900"," If you ever want to come, as a matter of fact, a trader podcast is coming out to visit me."
"10810540","10815020"," I'm not particularly wealthy, but I don't wear my wealth either."
"10816400","10818680"," I do like, I look normal. "
"10819160","10820480"," I act like an old person."
"10822180","10826540"," I don't partake, but I did at one time act like that, but when I was younger, but I don't"
"10826540","10826740"," anymore."
"10827960","10829080"," So I don't do any of that. "
"10831000","10835380"," I'm a very normal person, very grounded in that kind of stuff."
"10837720","10841160"," Oh, yeah, no, I'm not like, I don't do that Lambo shit."
"10841340","10841940"," I'm not that guy. "
"10842240","10842920"," Never have been."
"10844740","10847720"," The other thing that's happened to me too is I have exited."
"10848140","10849200"," I could have been wealthy. "
"10850340","10851640"," I own Bitcoin when it was worthless."
"10853640","10856660"," I sold a lot of houses in Detroit that I should have held."
"10857160","10858720"," I usually make that mistake. "
"10858720","10859620"," I sell too early."
"10861000","10862120"," I could be rich."
"10862400","10864720"," I could have been rich, but I can't. "
"10864720","10865940"," I'm not going to claim that I did that."
"10866080","10866540"," I didn't."
"10867300","10868880"," Bitcoin, I sold it. "
"10869240","10870840"," A halving, I think I sold."
"10871500","10877880"," And I sold a halving in 2016 or 17 somewhere in there."
"10878140","10879360"," I never should have fucking sold it. "
"10879360","10881920"," I moved to Detroit."
"10883060","10886200"," I was buying houses here for $1,500."
"10887200","10889180"," I got her after the $500 houses. "
"10889980","10896040"," Those houses unfixed up are now selling for $30,000 to $50,000, $60,000."
"10896900","10899260"," Some of them $100,000 untouched."
"10900880","10905940"," If I had saved those and renovated them, I'd be, I'd probably worth, I'd have fucking money. "
"10906080","10907440"," I'd have a hundred million or something."
"10909300","10911300"," Yeah, look at them blood in this shit down here."
"10911500","10912980"," Mother effers. "
"10916600","10917620"," I don't have that money."
"10917780","10919020"," I don't have the fucking money."
"10919480","10921100"," I don't, I honestly don't. "
"10922020","10926060"," If I, I think I have, if I had to guess I have pretty good."
"10926680","10928060"," I've decent liquidity, I think."
"10928880","10929860"," I own all my own homes. "
"10930240","10931080"," I don't have any mortgages."
"10931860","10933580"," I don't, I don't pay for cars."
"10934260","10936540"," Like, I don't, like I'd pay with cash. "
"10938640","10940340"," I have savings for my children."
"10940840","10944400"," I have colleges paid for that kind of stuff."
"10945500","10946360"," But I don't know. "
"10946700","10948040"," That kind of money I don't have."
"10949440","10957300"," I don't think that, I think that people think that, I think that, I think that people that don't"
"10957300","10961220"," have money don't realize how much money you actually need to have fucking money."
"10961960","10964400"," And then it needs to continue to come in. "
"10965980","10967200"," It's, it's a weird thing."
"10967480","10969860"," Like, um, I can spend a hundred grand in a month though."
"10971180","10972080"," Uh, easily. "
"10973260","10975740"," I can spend, um, it's really bizarre."
"10976320","10981000"," You like you, between your taxes, your cost of owning money, your cost of owning things, it's hard"
"10981000","10981480"," to explain."
"10982560","10986020"," I was talking to Joe the other day and I was like, I'm not, I don't really have a lot"
"10986020","10986340"," of money. "
"10986880","10989220"," I was like, I'm just trusted to manage it."
"10989380","10989700"," That's it."
"10990620","10993680"," Um, that's all it is. "
"10998700","11001540"," Yeah, we're bloodin right down here right now to the supply zone."
"11002340","11004060"," I'm getting blasted right now."
"11005200","11007880"," I've got a 22 cents right now and some calls. "
"11008420","11013120"," I did add, uh, added in the 43 cents, 42 cents range."
"11013820","11017440"," I'm at, uh, no, now 23 cents right now."
"11017440","11020880"," So I'm going to try to pick some more up and try to save my ass here. "
"11021340","11023440"," I got another 10 pack that I want to buy."
"11024200","11025940"," Um, because I'm getting blooded here."
"11026060","11028180"," This looks like they're going to sell the fucking news today, guys. "
"11029340","11031760"," Um, it's a really weird thing."
"11031900","11032700"," Money is a weird thing."
"11033040","11035300"," Um, it doesn't translate well. "
"11037160","11040120"," Like I have fucking bills that are out of my ass."
"11040580","11044780"," Like my, so my, um, in the house that I own right here, right, that I'm living in."
"11045400","11048900"," My fucking heating bill cost me 800 fucking dollars a month. "
"11050180","11050960"," That's no joke."
"11050960","11057180"," Uh, I have to pay for my own health insurance, right?"
"11057560","11059180"," Do you have any idea what that costs?"
"11059920","11061560"," Uh, it is fucking stupid."
"11062340","11063860"," Uh, what my healthcare costs are. "
"11064420","11067140"," I have daughters that have, I have one daughter with braces."
"11067940","11068860"," You know what that costs?"
"11069620","11069860"," Big money."
"11070460","11071880"," I've got two dogs right now, right?"
"11072920","11074180"," So I'm going to try to buy this ad. "
"11074320","11075600"," You see this ad down here for me?"
"11075780","11077280"," You should not be following me in this."
"11077400","11079900"," They're going to blood this fucker down into Monday."
"11095310","11098990"," I just bought 10 more contracts. "
"11101690","11103430"," Uh, it's a weird thing."
"11103590","11105110"," Money's a weird, money's a weird thing."
"11105370","11110210"," Like, uh, it's not everything it's cracked up to be like, so I feel like buy supplies, right?"
"11110990","11112150"," I have to buy sheets. "
"11112510","11114050"," I have to buy fucking soap."
"11114430","11115350"," I got to buy insurance."
"11115970","11118330"," I have to have insurance, special insurance on my homes. "
"11118330","11121910"," Uh, I have, uh, four electric bills."
"11122510","11125590"," I have, uh, like electric and gas bills combined."
"11126270","11129310"," I have, um, I have fuck ton of expenses. "
"11131030","11133050"," Like, I don't know, it's hard to explain."
"11133750","11136230"," So, um, money's the weird thing."
"11137550","11143390"," So in some ways, it can be easier to go get a job and, uh, just get a check, right?"
"11143670","11143990"," You get a check. "
"11143990","11146590"," Like, people, like, if you're a worker, right?"
"11146870","11151850"," If you have a job, if you have a job, uh, it can be a lot better."
"11153170","11154350"," Like, you go to work, right?"
"11154590","11158250"," You go to work on a Monday, let's say, it's 7.30 in the morning, 9.30 in the morning."
"11158390","11161690"," You go to a job, you leave it six or seven or five or whatever. "
"11162510","11162790"," You're done."
"11163790","11164210"," That's it."
"11164390","11164650"," You're done. "
"11165830","11166990"," Uh, you leave on a Friday."
"11167190","11167450"," You're done."
"11167450","11176030"," You're not responsible to pay people or to manage people or to, um, pay insurance or to do taxes or"
"11176030","11178970"," not get, uh, taken for a ride from people. "
"11179410","11181930"," Um, something breaks who has to fix it."
"11182150","11182350"," You do."
"11183090","11189550"," Um, there's so much, uh, there that I don't know if it's always worth it. "
"11189690","11192810"," There's, there's a, there's a desire to go work for somebody."
"11195870","11197370"," That's my last buy for the day."
"11197470","11198250"," That one right there. "
"11199170","11203470"," If this, if this one doesn't do it for me in that bloodshot down there, you see that ad right"
"11203470","11203750"," there?"
"11204270","11205510"," They're going to blood this fucker down."
"11205630","11206650"," We're going to see 5100."
"11211870","11215450"," Worst thing, uh, for you about money from you is family. "
"11217050","11221090"," Uh, you were a pro athlete and got handed a bunch of money at 21 and finally a few years"
"11221090","11222450"," later, I learned to say no to family."
"11223090","11225930"," My take on family is that you'll never see the money again."
"11226690","11227150"," It's gone. "
"11228810","11229410"," It's gone."
"11230530","11232410"," And then you can't expect to get it back either."
"11236570","11237970"," Yeah, I'm, I'm long here too. "
"11238550","11241810"," Uh, if you give money to family and friends, you'll never see it again."
"11242790","11244770"," You're either going to lose your friend or your, or your family member."
"11246290","11247790"," You know, there's like no other way, right?"
"11247990","11248670"," Just creates problems. "
"11254470","11256530"," Always give what you can afford to not see again."
"11256690","11257670"," That's how I feel about it."
"11260220","11263320"," And the biggest thing that I don't do is ever discuss money with my family. "
"11269130","11270070"," Consider a lot of gift."
"11272810","11275770"," Uh, the one problem with money too is they keep asking."
"11279070","11279730"," Right there. "
"11279750","11279990"," Look at that."
"11280190","11284990"," We are floating in the middle of nowhere right now target down below 5100."
"11286010","11287470"," We're going to blast down here. "
"11287530","11288090"," You ready for it?"
"11289590","11292690"," Target down below 5100 S one."
"11294950","11296790"," We are going to tag this right here."
"11296870","11298010"," Just so you know, you watch that. "
"11300690","11302930"," We're going to tag that bad boy right there."
"11308790","11310290"," Look at that right there."
"11310430","11310990"," Look at that trap. "
"11314290","11315990"," Just take him for a ride."
"11316190","11322010"," And as soon as they, as soon as they reject this one here, you're going to have a, um, four"
"11322010","11325650"," trigger bear cluster to the downside and blast down and hit that one right there."
"11326030","11327910"," It's going to get messy boys and girls. "
"11328490","11330430"," If you're a bear, congratulations."
"11333590","11336470"," 16 cents and I just paid 20."
"11337290","11343490"," So that this, uh, dip by cost me 25% of that trade. "
"11344010","11346890"," That means that there are no more bulls here."
"11347470","11347670"," None."
"11349220","11349550"," Zero. "
"11351160","11354470"," When they take 25% of those calls, that means there's no premium."
"11354770","11355390"," There's no bid."
"11355970","11357970"," No bid on calls here. "
"11358910","11358970"," None."
"11361190","11363230"," Price target down below right here."
"11366130","11367130"," Hold on here guys. "
"11375850","11377810"," There's your target right here."
"11378630","11379150"," 5100."
"11380430","11382550"," And it's going to rain blood here in just a moment. "
"11385410","11386870"," And leave that up for you."
"11390710","11391890"," No market left."
"11392550","11393030"," No more bulls. "
"11393470","11393750"," All gone."
"11394050","11395730"," All the bulls are like, have a happy Friday."
"11396310","11400150"," And we will likely trade that Tuesday low. "
"11400850","11403630"," Just so you know, by Monday morning."
"11405930","11410610"," The Tuesday low for Monday morning is likely going to come into play in a Monday."
"11415670","11418150"," That is, uh, let me take a look back on it. "
"11419570","11421690"," Not straight down though, by the way."
"11422890","11426330"," Tuesday low, um, price target 504."
"11427290","11433830"," Even if we bounce on this, even if we bounce here, this one right here, which you likely will. "
"11434190","11436770"," We will trade this down here just right there."
"11436890","11437490"," Come back up."
"11438230","11440850"," We'll blast out and clean this one out right here. "
"11441770","11442950"," So you can see it."
"11443650","11446110"," And then we're going to get under there by Tuesday."
"11447350","11452510"," So, uh, my projection here is by Tuesday, Wednesday, 505. "
"11453290","11463090"," If I had to guess 505 by Tuesday, I'm going to take it all out"
"11463090","11463370"," now."
"11469460","11472460"," Yeah, 505 by Tuesday at the latest."
"11475180","11476560"," Now there's no fight here. "
"11477160","11477860"," The bulls are gone."
"11478080","11479100"," Bires are gone."
"11479360","11480960"," Just so you know, they're all gone. "
"11481720","11482660"," There's no buyers here."
"11483520","11483860"," Zero."
"11485120","11486460"," The bulls are gone. "
"11486740","11488920"," They're going to wait for much lower."
"11490600","11491820"," They should be happy right here."
"11491920","11492740"," They're going to get a free ride. "
"11495400","11496740"," We're going down definitely."
"11499280","11500760"," This 512 is nothing."
"11503460","11504880"," Trust me, they're gone. "
"11505540","11507000"," The buyers are right here."
"11507200","11507880"," Just so you can see."
"11508960","11510340"," This is where the buyers are. "
"11511420","11511740"," They're gone."
"11511900","11513380"," Let me go over a 30 minute chart and show you."
"11513860","11514940"," Hold on a second here. "
"11519600","11522460"," So you guys need to know, understand this."
"11525040","11527160"," Run over here to see you can see it."
"11529340","11530960"," This is your demand right here. "
"11531660","11533100"," This is your demand right here."
"11533960","11535640"," And this is your demand right there."
"11535920","11537660"," The moment we lost that line up there. "
"11539040","11539560"," Right?"
"11540060","11540640"," They're gone."
"11541780","11544540"," That means that the buyers are down here."
"11544540","11546960"," That's your next row of buyers. "
"11547680","11551640"," So your first target is going to be 508, 509."
"11552820","11554060"," So we've lost this."
"11555100","11556760"," Now we'll be straight down. "
"11557400","11558480"," Not going like that."
"11558680","11561040"," You're going to go down, up, down, up, down, up."
"11561160","11563640"," You're going to eventually get down there and you're going to hit that demand. "
"11564700","11567820"," So this is where I will be as a buyer down there, right?"
"11568120","11569780"," We'll try that one, try to take it back up."
"11570640","11572320"," I just want to likely fail though as well."
"11572760","11579900"," And the reason I'm saying that is because down here is where you had all these put buyers. "
"11581160","11583780"," And they're going to try to clear those puts out."
"11583960","11586800"," The dealers will try to clear those puts out at some point."
"11587500","11595680"," So I'm going to expect us to trade 505 right there, but right around 505. "
"11597160","11598880"," That's my expectation for a target."
"11600640","11601820"," You're going to bounce down here though."
"11601980","11604820"," You got to bounce in here, but it should still fail. "
"11605080","11605820"," It should still fail."
"11610890","11612350"," And that was it right there."
"11612710","11613190"," No more buyers. "
"11613710","11614030"," Go on."
"11614510","11615390"," Go on."
"11617690","11620270"," Which makes sense anyways if you think about it, right?"
"11620570","11623930"," You figure by, I would expect that. "
"11624730","11628830"," I would expect that buyers won't be back until Wednesday."
"11629310","11630250"," They've been trained already."
"11632610","11634590"," So they've been trained not to be here. "
"11634770","11639650"," So you figure a high of 518 bulls are done."
"11639990","11644690"," And if I was a bull, I would say, yeah, we'll look at the market again on Wednesday."
"11648940","11650720"," Choose their Wednesday, something like that. "
"11653580","11655380"," I'm long from here again."
"11655680","11656940"," I have bought three times."
"11657400","11659040"," This is the last that I buy. "
"11665550","11666650"," What are you saying there?"
"11666810","11668330"," Oh, I missed your, uh, Mr. Comments."
"11669270","11672030"," I missed some of your comments that they saw some of them just slide by."
"11685900","11691180"," That's a target number one, uh, five, five, 1108. "
"11695260","11696340"," So right there."
"11696560","11696960"," That was it."
"11698380","11700500"," Bull's gone for the weekend wrapping it up. "
"11701200","11702200"," Sellers taking over."
"11702200","11712040"," Now downside target by Tuesday, 508 with an extension possibly to 505 into next"
"11712040","11712340"," week."
"11712400","11716220"," We talked about the window of weakness starting on the 11th. "
"11716320","11716760"," That's Monday."
"11717760","11723780"," You're going to, if you're a member of any kind, if you're a subscriber or a pro trader, you're"
"11723780","11732180"," going to get an extended calendar and expectations for the next couple of years."
"11732200","11737620"," A couple of weeks into March 28th of what to expect. "
"11737620","11740060"," And we have some heavy stuff coming out."
"11740440","11744260"," There's like all kinds of weirdness coming out, like lockout periods."
"11744680","11748080"," We've got some stuff with the banks that are coming out. "
"11748620","11757240"," We've got a NVDA, like a cheering, like once a year party for NVDA."
"11757240","11759120"," We've got OpEx."
"11759280","11760440"," We've got end of quarter. "
"11760700","11761720"," We've got JPM caller."
"11762280","11767600"," We have a ton of stuff coming up into end of month."
"11767820","11771080"," And it's a big calendar, huge calendar. "
"11771820","11775660"," And they want to park the bus as well into the end of quarter."
"11776020","11782840"," I want you to remember that because it's end of quarter, you have, you have this four, you look,"
"11783020","11785840"," you've got the monthly trades, right, for these banks."
"11785840","11788040"," And then you've got the quarterly trades. "
"11788860","11792140"," And so they're going to park the bus for that trade."
"11793200","11798460"," And I'm going to send this to you over the weekend so that you are aware of that calendar's time"
"11798460","11799220"," moves forward."
"11799980","11805800"," You're going to expect high volatility heading into that time frame. "
"11805800","11808080"," So let me explain how that looks."
"11809100","11815240"," If you have the slow grind up, right, just like that, you're not going to expect that."
"11815840","11822980"," You're going to expect moves just like this as we head into the end of the quarter, right?"
"11823460","11829160"," And you might even get a huge move down and quite possibly a huge move up. "
"11830040","11830440"," Okay."
"11830940","11836380"," And then you'll get a parking of the bus action as we head into the quarterly OpEx."
"11836600","11839920"," So it's going to get wild in here these next two weeks. "
"11840960","11849000"," So if you are a subscriber level, if you are a pro trader level, look for that report over the"
"11849000","11849380"," weekend."
"11850000","11851840"," So that you are prepared for next week."
"11851900","11858140"," If you read the market brief from last night, I told you that I would be sitting on my hands"
"11858140","11866340"," over this weekend and trying to close any of my winning positions and not taking any more risk in"
"11866340","11872200"," the market as we head into the end of the quarter that I will wrap up my trades. "
"11873000","11878960"," Now, as we head into this end of quarter as well, if you are a bull, I want you to"
"11878960","11881320"," think about the first two weeks of Q2."
"11882560","11889180"," You should be looking for some kind of positioning for Q2 in that first two weeks."
"11889180","11895960"," You will see new flows come into the market, whether those flows are bearish or if those flows are"
"11895960","11903180"," bullish long, you're going to be looking for those flows to come in to take a position. "
"11903940","11906860"," So you should see high volume those first couple of weeks."
"11907860","11915980"," Also another note here, CTA's are still crazy long this market, like insanely long this market."
"11915980","11918960"," So we haven't seen them divest yet. "
"11919620","11924020"," This market until we do, you may not get a dip to buy."
"11924800","11926140"," You really want to buy those."
"11926360","11927400"," Let me show you guys some here. "
"11927960","11928800"," You guys want some cool?"
"11929500","11930440"," They got some cool for you."
"11931640","11932340"," Hang tight here."
"11933660","11938710"," I got something cool for you. "
"11941730","11945290"," So for you to put size into the market."
"11956760","11957840"," What am I looking for here?"
"11958480","11959380"," I guess we could look at this."
"11968930","11971050"," So I want to show you guys a few things, okay?"
"11971870","11974470"," First thing that I want to show you is..."
"11990800","11996240"," First thing that I want to show you guys is the volatility that is going to come into the market"
"11996240","11997440"," on Monday. "
"11998740","12000560"," So I want to show you guys this, right?"
"12000760","12003440"," This is a March 11th right here, right?"
"12004180","12005800"," We're going to get heightened volatility."
"12006980","12008220"," Come back down here."
"12008260","12010180"," This is the 15th and 18th. "
"12012240","12015520"," And then another expansion of volatility up into the 21st."
"12016880","12019000"," Come back down and then park the bus."
"12019840","12027420"," You understand what I'm saying here?"
"12030400","12033600"," It's going to be crazy here by Tuesday, Wednesday, right?"
"12033820","12037000"," So you got the 12th right here. "
"12038120","12041420"," That's Tuesday, a flattening, right?"
"12042220","12044780"," So that's like Wednesday, kind of like a bottom of the market."
"12045200","12047120"," And then a rip up into the weekend, right?"
"12047240","12054140"," For Friday, maybe Thursday, Friday, but then the maintaining of that volatility and parking the bus"
"12054140","12057380"," into the 27th and 28th, right?"
"12057380","12060160"," Do you guys want to take a snapshot of this at home?"
"12062780","12068220"," Now, this doesn't mean the market's going to run like this, but I want you to be aware of the"
"12068220","12070860"," volatility that's coming into the beginning of the week."
"12071520","12076360"," When I was asking people on Twitter yesterday, the window of weakness is the 11th, right?"
"12077140","12084540"," I was making a joke against someone that uses or people that use that term window of weakness. "
"12085120","12087020"," I was referring to this right here."
"12088380","12095100"," That volatility expectation into the 11th and possibly the 12th right here."
"12095220","12095520"," You see it?"
"12097960","12104280"," So regardless of the gamma window of weakness, I'm looking at this window of weakness right here"
"12104280","12105120"," into next week. "
"12105700","12109800"," That's a pretty big increase into early next week."
"12110500","12114280"," The next thing that I want to show you guys is, let me show you one more thing here."
"12122780","12124080"," There's an under context. "
"12124660","12125080"," I think it's context."
"12125520","12125820"," There we go."
"12127740","12131680"," So this is S&P 500 CTAs. "
"12134180","12136060"," This is really fun right here, right?"
"12136540","12138440"," So this is a CTA positioning."
"12139500","12140760"," You see that right there?"
"12142420","12149380"," Now, this does not relate to price, but it shows when you enter the market."
"12150280","12150760"," Make sense?"
"12152200","12156540"," So if you start to see this bottoming and you want to put real risk on the market, like, I"
"12156540","12161400"," want to go buy a stock and hold it for a little while, you can kind of start to track"
"12161400","12164280"," when the big boys come in to buy, right?"
"12164920","12166700"," Now, this hasn't rolled down yet. "
"12167680","12171720"," We haven't seen a break of CTA money."
"12171920","12172940"," They're still hanging out here."
"12173800","12175340"," And we're coming into the end of quarter. "
"12176160","12178960"," So they might want to park that money into the 28."
"12179700","12184200"," So I wouldn't be all doom and gloom, even though we have volatility coming this next couple of"
"12184200","12184340"," weeks."
"12184340","12191420"," But you could see price action get crazy before it cools off into March, okay?"
"12191880","12195320"," So just for the end of March, excuse me. "
"12195620","12200800"," So you could see CTA's long into the end of the quarter here."
"12201620","12207500"," My preference, though, would be to have CTA's come down in their investment."
"12208180","12210580"," I always like to buy this kind of stuff down here. "
"12211100","12211480"," Make sense?"
"12211900","12217900"," So when you're out there and you hear like CTA's are adding, you're like CTA's are buyers right"
"12217900","12218120"," now."
"12218340","12219200"," That's this right here."
"12220320","12223920"," If they say, well CTA's are net long and they're not selling, it's right here. "
"12224580","12227480"," If they say CTA's are net sellers right here."
"12228460","12228660"," Okay?"
"12229220","12232960"," So when you hear that stuff out there, you're hearing me say something to you about CTA's being"
"12232960","12234060"," sellers, buyers, whatever."
"12235380","12238860"," That's because we're getting the flats, the vertical up for the vertical down. "
"12240160","12241600"," We're the flat down here."
"12242580","12249740"," But be personally, I always like to hear something like a CTA's or net buyers right now."
"12249820","12251200"," I love that stuff right there. "
"12253380","12254980"," And so we are not there right now."
"12255080","12258320"," They're just long into the end of the quarter and month."
"12259740","12261520"," I don't want to go back to the main screen. "
"12262900","12264800"," So not necessarily bearish."
"12264800","12266480"," Not necessarily."
"12267580","12271060"," I wouldn't say that I'm bearish into end of quarter. "
"12271540","12274080"," I would say expect volatility."
"12274880","12283640"," For at least today into at least Tuesday morning."
"12284640","12290020"," Expect some vol and then I would expect them to park the bus. "
"12291060","12292380"," Where they want it."
"12294100","12295760"," Into the end of quarter."
"12300810","12302090"," What do I think about what?"
"12304840","12307650"," I don't think that VIX has any relation to price anymore. "
"12315000","12317940"," What do I think about VIX into next week?"
"12318280","12319640"," I like it as a long."
"12320400","12322140"," Oh, no, let me rephrase that."
"12323120","12326440"," I'm still the belief of shorting VIX into the fucking ground. "
"12326440","12332980"," So if you see of high VIX into Monday or Tuesday, I'd be trying to sell that shit into the"
"12332980","12333400"," dumpster."
"12339200","12341900"," I'm not a fan of buying that."
"12341960","12344760"," Well, I'm not a fan of buying options in the VIX. "
"12346420","12349700"," I'm always trying to look for a peak on VIX to sell."
"12351980","12354720"," So I'm more of like a sell the VIX kind of a guy."
"12356660","12359660"," I used to get burned trying to buy the VIX a lot. "
"12359960","12360360"," I'd get smoked."
"12362580","12366140"," Like sell VIX into selling vol is a big thing right now."
"12367280","12370040"," There's volatility selling that's going on right now. "
"12370240","12372240"," There's like ball control shit going on."
"12373060","12374720"," You can see it all the time, right?"
"12375320","12377420"," Like you see it every day, right?"
"12377420","12379340"," Every day at like 10 in the morning."
"12380020","12384420"," They do it at 10.30. They do it at 11.30 or 12.30. They do it. "
"12384500","12386600"," Then they get the weird shit going on at 1.30 to 2."
"12387580","12390020"," There's a lot of ball control in the market right now."
"12390860","12392140"," You know that is, right?"
"12393420","12395160"," You know that's a fucking Fed."
"12397140","12398380"," That's Fed ball control. "
"12398560","12399340"," In my view it is."
"12400320","12402780"," I think the Fed is stepping in and stopping volatility."
"12406780","12409380"," So if you see a volatile day, you want to sell it. "
"12410040","12411320"," You'll do better that way."
"12416500","12420100"," We need to get and stay underneath the gamma flip."
"12421780","12423300"," You need to change sentiment. "
"12425220","12429880"," You need the like you need mass sentiments to be bearish."
"12430340","12432520"," We don't have any of those reasons right now."
"12432700","12436040"," We have like everybody's all fucking everyone's like, I'm going to buy a dip. "
"12436320","12440720"," Jerome Powell is saving the markets, saving the economy right now."
"12441160","12443780"," We have no reason right now to not sell vol."
"12445600","12446440"," Everyone's excited. "
"12446980","12447700"," Everyone's happy."
"12448500","12449160"," People are happy."
"12449320","12450000"," They can sell their homes. "
"12450440","12451800"," The people in the streets are happy."
"12452460","12454760"," There's no there's no reason for vol to it at the moment."
"12455020","12455660"," You kind of need. "
"12456320","12457260"," You kind of need."
"12458160","12462500"," You need like someone or something to set that up, but it's not here yet."
"12462500","12464660"," We need doom, like real doom. "
"12466120","12469540"," Think about sentiments from your fellow traders."
"12470660","12471160"," None of them are."
"12471500","12472540"," None of them are scared. "
"12473240","12474320"," Nobody's scared right now."
"12474520","12475500"," Everybody's making great money."
"12476120","12477540"," So I don't know what to say to you on that. "
"12492160","12494240"," Need Detroit in 1988."
"12495160","12496280"," I'm not from Detroit."
"12496280","12496820"," I don't. "
"12499080","12500620"," Oh, yeah, you need to try it in 1988."
"12500620","12501980"," I get what you're saying."
"12502300","12503140"," Yeah, yeah, you need. "
"12503280","12504100"," I get what you're saying now."
"12506640","12507600"," You need like."
"12509880","12510440"," You don't. "
"12510520","12511280"," It's going to be that bad."
"12511400","12512220"," You just need the general."
"12512400","12513140"," Like you need it. "
"12513260","12517180"," It's easy to change sentiment, but you need that change of sentiment."
"12519220","12522940"," To start like buying ball buying ball right now has been dangerous."
"12524080","12526240"," Well, that dangerous to be tactful. "
"12527040","12527760"," Longing ball."
"12529960","12531620"," There's like a routine right now."
"12531760","12532540"," You guys don't know. "
"12532560","12533560"," See the routine out there."
"12533640","12536260"," They're like selling Monday, Tuesday, sometimes Wednesday."
"12537580","12539680"," They like set it up like you come in on a Monday. "
"12539800","12540820"," They blast it up, right?"
"12541360","12544540"," You get a high on Monday in the open and then they're selling us down into Wednesday."
"12544880","12546420"," You guys are all seeing that, right?"
"12547140","12548440"," It's fairly, fairly common."
"12551300","12552620"," Ask a bear out there. "
"12552960","12554580"," Like every day we come out, right?"
"12555080","12556580"," And we'll like roll down."
"12556940","12557780"," I'll buy some puts."
"12559040","12560880"," And I'll sit here on streaming go. "
"12561280","12562720"," Here's your first chance bear."
"12563580","12565060"," I'll buy a second round of puts."
"12565280","12567000"," I'll say there's your second chance bear. "
"12567600","12569240"," And then the third one of the day I go."
"12569400","12569680"," That's it."
"12569880","12570460"," You got your chance. "
"12571400","12574920"," They're going to rip this fucker right into the clothes because you couldn't get some, some new"
"12574920","12576440"," lows and turn it on for it."
"12576440","12586210"," I can't read shit."
"12603020","12604580"," I'm still long here, by the way. "
"12605980","12606960"," Still long here."
"12615340","12616420"," So, uh, all right."
"12616580","12617380"," So it's been a, hold on. "
"12617420","12618020"," Give me a little bit of magic."
"12618140","12618360"," Some water."
"12618460","12619380"," I'm losing my voice already. "
"12629460","12629820"," Okay."
"12630060","12630980"," So we're going to talk about here."
"12633920","12635500"," We started as a started. "
"12635700","12637880"," It's going to be the, I turned the ads off today on YouTube."
"12637900","12639900"," So you're going to get a, you're going to get an avatar."
"12639900","12644220"," So today's broadcast is sponsored by trade, the trigger. "
"12645040","12645640"," Sorry, Twitch."
"12645940","12646540"," You got ads today."
"12648120","12649080"," You're a YouTuber. "
"12649180","12650020"," You're going to get an ad for me."
"12652120","12654860"," So we started out as a free subscription."
"12655820","12657480"," We did that for three years. "
"12658640","12665420"," And along the way, it has cost a lot of time, money, commitment to do this."
"12665840","12667400"," It's, it's made me very poor."
"12671660","12676400"," It has also taken the time and commitment of many, many volunteers. "
"12677580","12681520"," These are people that do a lot of work here for free."
"12682200","12683160"," Absolutely free."
"12684060","12685880"," They've given their time and their energy. "
"12686680","12690000"," It's cost us a lot of money to develop some of the stuff that we have as well."
"12691580","12694940"," But we wanted to either shut this thing down that we do."
"12695340","12696320"," We're going to shut it down. "
"12696320","12699300"," Or see if it could become self sustainable."
"12701100","12704640"," So I did not want to monetize."
"12705740","12708800"," I felt as though that wasn't our mandate as a community. "
"12709440","12714920"," Our community's mandate was to, we started with should always be free."
"12715920","12716600"," Always."
"12717820","12724320"," And we have to find a way though to keep it growing or maintain it, keep people involved and happy"
"12724320","12725680"," and still pay the bills. "
"12726540","12727740"," We got to pay the bills."
"12729400","12732480"," So we brought this to a vote with our audience."
"12733320","12735380"," Our discord our audience and everybody. "
"12735940","12741560"," And what we came up with was we would try a paid model with a free model."
"12741780","12742160"," So both."
"12743680","12750280"," The idea here is that if you are or are a person that needs a free model, they'll always be"
"12750280","12751300"," that there for you. "
"12752500","12754840"," So we still have a free model."
"12755060","12757660"," That's what we do a free model to this day."
"12758780","12760460"," Now we did run in some issues. "
"12761340","12766360"," One issue was our chat at one time was free and open."
"12766780","12771960"," We attracted a lot of bots, scammers, hit and run people with was like a high or low in the"
"12771960","12772280"," market."
"12773020","12775060"," So we had to turn on a paid feature. "
"12776320","12777060"," For that."
"12777980","12783120"," And that slowed down a lot of the counter stuff that you're trying to hear a lot of people come"
"12783120","12783720"," in and go in."
"12784200","12785180"," That kind of stuff. "
"12785640","12788920"," You get like Russian bots who get like spammers you name it."
"12789420","12791340"," So we turned on the paid feature for that."
"12792000","12792440"," Now. "
"12793620","12795440"," That did away with a lot of that crap."
"12797080","12799680"," Now there's still a free way for you to chat here."
"12800180","12803980"," Even though we turned on the free version and what that is because an extra step. "
"12805000","12806720"," Once you put on the extra step."
"12807560","12809500"," You get rid of a lot of the bad shit."
"12811440","12815440"," So if you ever want to chat here for free, you can. "
"12815940","12822100"," You can go to Amazon prime gaming and you can subscribe for Captain Jim James."
"12823240","12826340"," And you can watch me on Twitch and chat there as long as you want."
"12827760","12829660"," And it's free cost you nothing. "
"12831780","12834500"," The other thing that we had a problem with though is our discord."
"12835640","12838560"," We're having issues we had thousands of people in there."
"12838960","12841520"," But we also because we're finance we're in finance right. "
"12842400","12844860"," We attract a lot of scammers and bots and wolves."
"12845860","12851160"," We attract a lot of people that are not serious about their trading as well."
"12851160","12856160"," People that I really like but you know which we attracted that by being a free and open discord. "
"12856840","12860080"," And there are some really serious things that we are doing."
"12860340","12860400"," Right."
"12860580","12861180"," This is our money. "
"12861400","12864120"," It's very important for us to not lose it."
"12864740","12866040"," And to grow our money."
"12866200","12866320"," Right. "
"12867000","12872520"," So what we did was if you are a free member, you can you'll always enjoy that."
"12873000","12879780"," And in fact, because we turned on a pay model, your free service should become a better experience."
"12879780","12883680"," As a matter of fact, these streams are more consistent now. "
"12884900","12886700"," And they're very much more consistent."
"12887900","12894120"," And you also have people with access to our tools, to our market briefs, all that kind of fun"
"12894120","12894420"," stuff."
"12895260","12899280"," And then you have the community able to have some synergy. "
"12900280","12900420"," Right."
"12900660","12901440"," Where it's like, Hey, I got this."
"12901540","12902000"," And I got that. "
"12902220","12902600"," What are you seeing?"
"12902820","12903280"," What am I seeing?"
"12904340","12905680"," What a cap do last night."
"12905820","12907900"," I told you we're going to go up there and slap 5 18."
"12908260","12908720"," We did it, right?"
"12909220","12909460"," Boom. "
"12909580","12910340"," We slap 5 18."
"12911140","12914300"," This earlier this week, we're like, Hey, we're still a buyer of dips here."
"12914480","12915600"," We're not selling rips. "
"12915880","12917440"," We are buying dips here."
"12917780","12919320"," And sure enough, that worked out."
"12919440","12920700"," We made a lot of money doing that. "
"12921040","12923640"," Even with the extensions down earlier in the week."
"12923860","12925200"," So anyways, the point here is this."
"12926860","12928000"," This free model. "
"12928500","12931380"," There's also a website that we launched."
"12931840","12934840"," If you ever want to join that, if you ever want to support our community."
"12935840","12938340"," It would prefer that you didn't, that you stop donating. "
"12939340","12940800"," Stop donating to us."
"12942940","12946680"," Unless you're not a member, if you want to donate because you make some money, sure, but."
"12947480","12949780"," We would prefer that you don't donate anymore. "
"12950460","12957120"," We have a supporter level that's $32 a month if you sign up for the year."
"12958550","12960240"," And that gets you access to our discord."
"12960960","12964180"," Some tools, some trigger charts twice a day. "
"12964860","12966260"," You get market updates and briefs."

"13056540","13057900"," It was just a soft launch. "
"13058280","13058560"," Word of mouth."
"13058900","13059380"," That was it."
"13060080","13062900"," We haven't sent any emails out to anybody. "
"13063260","13068780"," None of you should have received an email at this point that we've launched the website."
"13069000","13071600"," So we're very soft opening right now."

"13077660","13079460"," 32 bucks a month for the year."
"13079620","13080080"," It's pretty cheap."
"13080460","13082020"," I think it's 380 bucks for the year. "
"13082360","13084540"," So 360 or 380 or something like that."
"13085100","13085800"," Really, really inexpensive."
"13087040","13088600"," So that's my spiel for the week. "
"13088600","13091120"," That's the, that's the, that's the ad for trade the trigger."
"13092140","13093580"," What else have to say to you guys?"
"13093840","13094240"," It's Friday."
"13094460","13095960"," It's 127 in the afternoon. "
"13096620","13102720"," We're going to see right now between 130 and two the manipulation come into the marketplace."
"13103160","13103560"," Be careful."
"13104120","13110220"," If we are heading down right now, they will try to squeeze you out before we can have, may have"
"13110220","13116040"," more continuation to the downside for next Monday and Tuesday. "
"13116040","13119040"," But I am right now pretty bearish."
"13120720","13122460"," Not, not confirmed yet."
"13123360","13127460"," But I'm pretty like bears for a more pullback into Monday or Tuesday. "
"13128180","13132840"," And this cross of the hourly trigger, if we can keep this up, if you're a seller, if you can"
"13132840","13141160"," maintain price below and catch a new low over here, I'm going to be telling you to be looking for"
"13141160","13144060"," a nice fat run to the downside."
"13146700","13150500"," Into a Tuesday, Monday or Tuesday, somewhere in there."
"13152280","13153940"," Move that over so you can see it. "
"13159450","13160470"," Leave that one out."
"13160630","13161990"," You can see it right down in here."
"13166480","13170900"," And if you want updates on that stuff, if you want, if you ever want those reports, I make them"
"13170900","13172580"," every, or wherever we need them, I make them. "
"13172900","13177280"," I draw where it's going and all that kind of stuff before it happens."
"13178120","13181760"," You get that before, the night before, the morning before that kind of stuff."
"13182380","13183900"," And I write a bunch of shit for you. "
"13184000","13185200"," I'm like, yeah, you're going to watch out for that."
"13185460","13189300"," And don't pay attention to that and pay attention to this and all that kind of stuff."
"13197240","13200060"," Yeah, you still need a, this is the last part. "
"13200180","13203560"," Even though I said I'm bearish on a Tuesday, I got to clarify that."
"13204280","13205900"," Let me be very clear with you here."
"13207180","13209000"," We are still buyers of dips. "
"13210720","13216240"," Still buyers of dips until there's a confirmation of rejection on the hourly trigger."
"13217220","13219640"," And then we are only bearish down to the daily trigger."
"13220340","13220900"," I do. "
"13221080","13227180"," I'm not a net seller until we get below the daily trigger with price and the hourly trigger on a"
"13227180","13227600"," confirmation."
"13228540","13231340"," If you don't know what that looks like, I'm going to show it to you."
"13233540","13236760"," We should talk about that because they put it in the briefs all the time. "
"13237480","13239740"," I'm going to show you what I mean by that right now."
"13243310","13245530"," I need to do a video on this too."
"13248010","13255930"," I'm going to show you guys what I mean by am I a buyer of dips or a seller of"
"13255930","13256330"," rips. "
"13258390","13259970"," Let me mute this right here."
"13261490","13265830"," Because I put this in a lot of, I put it in most of the market briefs, but I want"
"13265830","13267430"," you, I want to update it for you."
"13267970","13271590"," I'm going to show you what a buyer of dips and a seller of rips is right now. "
"13274090","13275330"," Move that over."
"13276510","13277550"," Move that right there."
"13286030","13286990"," This price. "
"13288970","13293850"," If prices above the hourly trigger, you are a buyer of dips."
"13294310","13294590"," Make sense?"
"13295110","13295710"," Come back down."
"13296110","13296810"," You're buying the dip. "
"13296810","13297230"," Bam."
"13299530","13304590"," If price breaks below the hourly trigger, so that's the early trigger right there, right?"
"13305550","13307670"," Now we broke down today, right?"
"13308630","13311730"," You are still not a seller of rips."
"13312490","13317390"," You need to see rejection even with all this emotion right here, right?"
"13318470","13323790"," You still need to see, pay close attention to what I'm saying to you right now. "
"13323790","13329770"," You still need to see a confirmed rejection."
"13330530","13332750"," We come up to this hourly trigger right there."
"13333390","13334870"," That's the hourly trigger, right?"
"13342060","13353580"," I would need to see the rejection right here and the"
"13353580","13357080"," break of that last, whatever that last low will be. "
"13357900","13358380"," Okay."
"13359740","13362480"," From that point to become a seller of rips."
"13363180","13363720"," Do you understand?"
"13364440","13368820"," That would mean that no matter what the price action is, as long as we are below it, from that"
"13368820","13376560"," point forward, as long as price action remains below the hourly trigger, any rip would get sold. "
"13377120","13379060"," So if we rip there, I'm a seller."
"13379840","13381740"," I'm not a buyer of this dip."
"13382320","13383540"," That's not a dip buy. "
"13383680","13384180"," That is weight."
"13384640","13385200"," Don't do anything."
"13385840","13387100"," And then you sell that rip. "
"13387360","13390440"," Squeezes back up and you are a seller of the rip again."
"13390700","13391300"," Does that make sense?"
"13392220","13392660"," Seller of the rip."
"13393140","13393920"," Seller of the rip. "
"13394500","13395040"," Seller of the rip."
"13395540","13399540"," The same thing applies to being a buyer of the dip."
"13400420","13404040"," So you're buying the dip, comes back down, you buy it. "
"13404320","13405900"," Comes back down, you buy it."
"13406120","13407660"," Comes back down, you buy it."
"13407840","13408140"," Makes sense?"
"13409160","13411020"," I'm hoping you got that makes sense to you guys. "
"13411020","13414000"," Now, in this regime right here, right?"
"13414220","13416100"," So you're a buyer of dips, seller of rips."
"13417400","13421140"," The bulls are still on trend."
"13422260","13428660"," So if you were to ask me right now, are you bullish or bearish, I would tell you I am"
"13428660","13429160"," bullish. "
"13429980","13430600"," Does that make sense?"
"13431740","13431860"," No?"
"13432300","13434720"," Look at how much doom and gloom we have, right?"
"13436560","13438100"," I would become bearish."
"13439940","13445580"," If we break the daily trigger, that's over here, this yellow line."
"13446460","13447060"," Okay?"
"13447440","13451160"," As long as price remains above it, we are bullish. "
"13452400","13453620"," Regardless of your sentiment."
"13454600","13456000"," And I can tell you why too."
"13459820","13461180"," That's a really ugly red. "
"13464120","13466000"," I'm going to show you why right now."
"13466000","13475740"," If you were not a by the dipper on the daily trigger, you're getting your ass"
"13475740","13476640"," blown out, right?"
"13477560","13479600"," Ass blown out, ass blown out."
"13480140","13485200"," So right now, right below the green, we're a seller of dips, right?"
"13486220","13488620"," And then I'm a buyer of dips down here too, right?"
"13488780","13492820"," The moment we cross over the green line, we're off and running again, right?"
"13493600","13495480"," Cross below the green line, no more buying. "
"13495800","13497080"," Get back above it again, we're a buyer."
"13497080","13499600"," Cross below it, not a buyer anymore."
"13500060","13502680"," Makes sense, but I'm still bullish because trend is up. "
"13504040","13512400"," I become bearish, not only a seller of rips, but I become bearish."
"13514820","13518880"," If we break below the daily trigger, so that would be price."
"13521900","13524280"," Let's say we bled all this down right here, right?"
"13525980","13528360"," We blast down here, it's all evil. "
"13534330","13536430"," You see price come back up right here?"
"13536630","13540790"," And then you see a little consolidation, right?"
"13542570","13544010"," Like, oh shit, here we go."
"13549490","13551430"," Start busting up like this, right?"
"13552250","13555330"," Failure again from buyers, they failed to come back up."
"13556030","13558870"," Second failure from buyers to come back up, right?"
"13559410","13561190"," What else is going on at that time frame?"
"13562470","13565210"," The hourly trigger is coming down, isn't it?"
"13565610","13567090"," Coming down just like this, right?"
"13574670","13577530"," And you watch that daily trigger starts to come right over. "
"13579730","13580570"," See that?"
"13583070","13586910"," And this is where you get a reversal of trend."
"13588030","13593110"," This is what a correction looks like."
"13593110","13597690"," Now you might be thinking to yourself, well, cap, you know, bullish here. "
"13598130","13607150"," If you get that failure here, then you confirm that failure and that cross, and you get the new low"
"13607150","13608470"," right there, like right there."
"13608530","13609350"," You get that new low?"
"13611710","13615730"," This is the confirmation of a correction, okay?"
"13616150","13618910"," Confirmation of a correction that's going to take place."
"13619750","13627490"," If you are a bear or a bull and you see that at any point, this whole thing, it should"
"13627490","13628510"," look just like this. "
"13630070","13635650"," The moment that we cross there and catch that new low right here, right?"
"13635970","13636470"," This new low?"
"13637110","13642810"," We are confirmed to be in a correction until it resolves back above the daily trigger."
"13643530","13646250"," And you will begin to get really fucking bearish."
"13646250","13650610"," Like we are going down to the depths of hell in downtown. "
"13651730","13654030"," This is a pretty big money trade."
"13654970","13656950"," This is a huge money trade."
"13657530","13659890"," I am talking like rich. "
"13660830","13664530"," It has a high probability as well of paying you."
"13666290","13667530"," Big money."
"13668370","13671630"," I am going to show you this in the reverse right now, okay?"
"13671630","13678270"," The reverse is when we have the cross right here. "
"13679430","13680810"," And I mean big money."
"13681050","13683730"," This is for weeks and weeks, okay?"
"13683970","13685030"," Weeks and weeks and weeks."
"13685790","13686910"," Weeks and weeks and weeks. "
"13688270","13694870"," So when we see that, it would not surprise me to see us break down and get down there."
"13696890","13698010"," 460, 470."
"13699170","13704350"," It never shocks me either if we actually go to the monthly. "
"13705250","13707830"," And you break down, slam down, right?"
"13708630","13712710"," Comes right back up and this one comes over, slam down, right?"
"13713790","13717870"," We get underneath the weekly, come back up, bam, slam down."
"13718130","13718650"," There is your 423."
"13720370","13723870"," So step by step by step by step. "
"13726810","13736260"," So for next week, as of right now, as of right now, still not"
"13736260","13736980"," bearish."
"13737640","13743860"," So I am expecting a pullback into Monday or Tuesday, and I am going to expect that dip to get"
"13743860","13744160"," bought."
"13744960","13749180"," As a matter of fact, we are heading into where?"
"13750940","13754660"," The end of quarter, right?"
"13755100","13757420"," Remember that, end of quarter we are heading into. "
"13759260","13768720"," So if this is the top to the end of quarter, and they want to park this bad boy"
"13768720","13772140"," into the end of the quarter, right?"
"13772360","13773260"," You get the quarter over here."
"13777630","13778390"," Right there, right?"
"13778530","13779270"," This is the end of the quarter, right?"
"13779410","13780470"," They got a big old fat bus."
"13781150","13782370"," Jamie Diamond is boys. "
"13783190","13785170"," We got all kinds of people to fall that trade."
"13786570","13788130"," And there it is right there, right?"
"13789670","13792170"," And they start to, they're like, yeah, whoo!"
"13792290","13793350"," Orts down, doesn't matter."
"13794210","13797910"," If we're going down into an end of a quarter, or up into a quarter, it doesn't really matter. "
"13798090","13803510"," What does matter, though, is they try to bring price to where they want it, and then it becomes"
"13803510","13807910"," this like whiplash, and then it just slows right down."
"13811870","13813670"," Right where they want it."
"13813830","13814450"," You get what I'm saying?"
"13814690","13816010"," You even have this down here, right?"
"13816730","13818330"," Parking the bus, parking the bus. "
"13819110","13820030"," Couple weeks left."
"13821810","13823510"," You're going, why isn't it going down?"
"13823690","13824750"," Or why isn't it going up?"
"13824970","13826350"," They're just parking this fucking bus."
"13828730","13833130"," And then here they make new decisions for what they're going to do for Q2. "
"13833550","13834350"," Does it make sense?"
"13834750","13839390"," So just be aware of this as we get into the end of quarter."
"13840350","13841610"," Pretty easy to see, right?"
"13841730","13842250"," When you look at it."
"13843870","13846250"," So now we're going to look at the..."
"13848190","13849330"," the JPM caller. "
"13849650","13850790"," We can break through the caller."
"13851390","13852110"," The caller's get popped."
"13852930","13854870"," Let's just see where we are with the caller right now. "
"13856250","13857670"," So just look at this right here."
"13862980","13864660"," Or above the caller, he popped it."
"13866000","13867260"," Would it shock you to see?"
"13868800","13870020"," You see that right there?"
"13873540","13874600"," Something right in there. "
"13874680","13879360"," Just park the bus into the end of the quarter."
"13881960","13882640"," Make sense?"
"13883000","13883400"," Bring it up."
"13883660","13884280"," Bring price up. "
"13884500","13885200"," Come back down."
"13885620","13886180"," Settle it down."
"13886980","13888340"," Wherever you have to dig into that caller. "
"13888720","13892560"," Now if we get above, we trade back up here on Monday."
"13893600","13896900"," And then when we ride this up, we will take that trade when it comes."
"13898360","13902280"," But for right now, we get some expected volatility. "
"13903640","13909200"," And I'm going to expect that volatility to try to calm down as we head into the end of quarter."
"13910680","13912620"," Now if we break below this too, right?"
"13912800","13914140"," You can always look at this as well."
"13914520","13916640"," We might break through here for a minute. "
"13918140","13918860"," Make sense?"
"13920100","13922000"," We might close that gap down there."
"13923300","13925180"," Take all that bad boy out right there."
"13925180","13928740"," But I'm not a seller of this unless we break down. "
"13929700","13931100"," Reject it and get a new low."
"13933360","13937740"," If you want to take that one down right there, I still need to see that happen right there."
"13946330","13947430"," See it right now now?"
"13948430","13948750"," Blasting. "
"13950010","13952630"," Blast, blast, blast, blast."
"13954470","13955710"," Sorry, I'm losing my voice here."
"13957570","13958710"," Look at that, nothing. "
"13959590","13961030"," You took my calls, baby."
"13962370","13963590"," You took all my calls."
"13965050","13969830"," You took me right there. "
"13970110","13972430"," You took me right there again, going all the way down."
"13973330","13976010"," Feeding the fuel for the fire to pay off the puts, baby."
"13977690","13979250"," Next target to the downside. "
"13982770","13983530"," Right there."
"13984170","13990850"," And by Tuesday, that whole trade will be erased."
"13998630","13999930"," Good boss, good boss. "
"14000330","14009050"," This is where the buyers left."
"14009730","14010070"," Right here."
"14010270","14010770"," That's where they left. "
"14010950","14011390"," They're gone."
"14012250","14014330"," And they're going to sell this all the way down."
"14022190","14023610"," So you guys have any questions?"
"14024890","14025510"," Because it's Friday. "
"14026550","14029990"," You guys have any questions for Monday and I can answer them for you."
"14043210","14046390"," On the bright side, you still have 50k worth of money."
"14046790","14047330"," You know what?"
"14047450","14049070"," I had two great trades this week. "
"14050310","14053370"," I made a significant amount of money this week."
"14053450","14054090"," It was a really good week."
"14056050","14056670"," Test update. "
"14057050","14057690"," We did one this morning."
"14058390","14062690"," I did a full test update this morning for you so that you can go back into the show and"
"14062690","14063230"," look at that one."
"14063450","14068590"," And I also do test updates twice a week with market briefs. "
"14070090","14073170"," Yeah, I got it this morning for you."
"14082030","14083310"," We have an indicator."
"14083650","14087930"," We have the T3 trade indicator with triggers and velocity on the website. "
"14088650","14095410"," You can check those out there if you like."
"14096570","14098010"," Will I break out the whiskey today?"
"14098970","14099850"," I can't."
"14100690","14102810"," So I wasn't supposed to be here this morning. "
"14102810","14106030"," I was like, well, I told Joe I'm like, I'm going to put the stream up and then I get"
"14106030","14107030"," a bunch of shit I got to do."
"14107470","14110130"," And then I'm like, I'll hang out with them and then I started blabbing and stuff."
"14110270","14110630"," It's Friday. "
"14113410","14115230"," Yeah, I saw the plane tie that fell off."
"14119570","14120950"," I'm going to hang in the morning cap."
"14121170","14121790"," What are you going to have?"
"14122250","14122730"," I can't drink. "
"14122890","14125770"," I got a, I can't drink right now."
"14125790","14127670"," I've got a lot of stuff going on in the background."
"14128710","14131890"," So you guys see me on stream, but you don't see me working. "
"14132670","14134610"," I'm working like a mad man right now."
"14139890","14141350"," Oh, here's another thing."
"14142310","14145510"," I've got a fucking huge put spread on right now. "
"14146410","14147490"," A massive one."
"14150670","14153350"," Yeah, that's why I can't drink right now."
"14154310","14155490"," I got too much shit going on. "
"14155650","14156390"," A wife, kids."
"14157650","14160170"," I'm neglecting my children, my wife right now."
"14160170","14163710"," And I'm babysitting an adult right now. "
"14165230","14172870"," I'm babysitting someone with a mental health issue on the background that needs to be fixed right"
"14172870","14173130"," away."
"14175890","14176550"," What's that?"
"14178370","14179270"," Oh, is it Lent?"
"14179970","14180770"," Oh, you said Lent?"
"14182290","14182910"," Oh, is it Lent?"
"14183170","14184170"," Is the reason I can't drink?"
"14184950","14185270"," It's FUT."
"14186050","14188950"," I know a lot of Irish Catholics that drink through Lent. "
"14200390","14200790"," It's a thing."
"14200790","14201450"," Lent's my ass."
"14203390","14205030"," You know what I was thinking about this week?"
"14206390","14208530"," I grew up in Boston. "
"14210010","14211270"," You guys might not know that."
"14211390","14212110"," I grew up in Boston."
"14216690","14217090"," Wetyped. "
"14218710","14222090"," And, uh, when I was a wee lad there in Boston, right?"
"14223290","14225110"," Do you and I remember about Boston?"
"14227590","14230610"," I remember you bet."
"14230790","14232590"," Oh, you bet it was lent over today."
"14233250","14234370"," Oh, you've been lent over today. "
"14235390","14242090"," So I was, I was in, I was the reason I'm thinking about this is because in Boston, right?"
"14242490","14243630"," Oh, yeah, I was nasty to you."
"14243650","14246910"," They rolled it twice and they're not done rolling it over either."
"14247350","14249930"," They're going to blood the fuck out of this and take us back to Tuesday. "
"14252310","14254430"," Yeah, I think the cats attacking somebody else."
"14255870","14262170"," So on, um, on, uh, whole air."
"14262370","14264650"," So, okay, so I'm going to give another story for you. "
"14265030","14272730"," So I was thinking about this because, uh, what's going on over in Palestine, right?"
"14275050","14281330"," And, uh, Israel and Palestine, and we have a large Palestinian population here in Detroit."
"14283490","14287710"," And, uh, a lot, like, like first generation immigrants, Palestinians."
"14288490","14290390"," And you know that nobody likes Palestinians, right?"
"14290670","14292050"," Like the Syria doesn't like them. "
"14292590","14294450"," Israel doesn't like nobody fucking likes them."
"14294590","14295950"," They fucking like lock them all up or whatever."
"14296870","14300810"," Um, and you know, they've been like a bunch of jokes for years. "
"14300810","14304610"," Like the terrorists and all that shit, the old movies in the 1970s and 80s."
"14304990","14307430"," But we took a lot of Palestinians in here in, uh, Detroit."
"14308310","14314610"," And I had a guy talking to me about, uh, he was really trashing like a Dearborn and Hamtramic"
"14314610","14316770"," Detroit general. "
"14317150","14322630"," We have a large Christian, uh, Middle Eastern population."
"14323230","14326690"," Cal deans are called, which surprises people."
"14326850","14329490"," And then we have a large Palestinian population here. "
"14330150","14334090"," And this guy was saying some stuff to me like really, really nasty stuff."
"14334790","14343950"," And I was like, well, made me think of something that I haven't thought about in a long time."
"14344550","14353970"," When I was really young, uh, you could go to St. Patrick's Day in South Boston and, uh, they would"
"14353970","14363850"," have dinners, uh, like a dinner or a lunch where you would sponsor an ex, uh, prisoner from Ireland"
"14363850","14368630"," that was an IRA soldier or what's that, what an Irish Catholic would call a soldier. "
"14369370","14371330"," But everyone else called a fucking terrorist."
"14372210","14377450"," And, uh, so you would go to these, like, right around St. Patrick's Day and then you'd go to the"
"14377450","14379910"," St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston in Southeast."
"14381370","14385690"," Right on Dot Ave and down Dorchester Ave and all that, all that, all that parade would go on,"
"14385790","14385930"," right?"
"14386210","14391730"," And they would, they would like spray paint, uh, shooters from like the walls and stuff. "
"14391890","14396750"," They was like, there was like a, there was like an outline of a, um, terrorists and Irish Catholic"
"14396750","14397130"," terrorist."
"14397990","14405430"," And, uh, you would hear the chants from kids and teenagers in Boston, uh, kids, all know the songs"
"14405430","14409230"," and the chants for the IRA, uh, in the city of Boston."
"14410030","14412110"," And I, it made me think of that. "
"14412590","14416090"," And if you go to South Boston, now it's no longer like that."
"14416350","14424930"," The, you see Boston in general, it's been gentrified and not only gentrified, it's been, um, it's"
"14424930","14432510"," been a culture ride where you've had like Irish Catholics that have lived in the US for such a long"
"14432510","14437450"," period of time that their second, third, fourth, fifth generation kids are more like Americans."
"14438230","14441190"," You know, you just don't see it like you used to see it. "
"14443130","14443910"," So you did."
"14444030","14445950"," You worked in the USS Constitution right on, man."
"14447310","14448290"," Heck yeah, dude. "
"14448770","14450610"," I used to bump my head in the Constitution."
"14451270","14452170"," I'm six foot one."
"14452390","14455110"," So I walk, I walk the decks like this. "
"14460590","14469570"," Target down below 509, um, Oh, we're actually on S one right now."
"14469570","14470370"," You might get a pullback."
"14470930","14472510"," You might actually get a pullback here. "
"14477670","14483910"," Uh, but it was fascinating because here in Detroit, I'm like, boy, these, I'm like these, these"
"14483910","14485810"," Palestinians are like, we're going to go to school."
"14485950","14486730"," We're going to get a job."
"14487010","14487690"," We're going to make some money. "
"14488950","14490430"," No one's telling us what to do."
"14490430","14494610"," And they're, they're like productive members of society here in, uh, Detroit."
"14495490","14501810"," And I'm telling they remind me of Irish Catholic immigrants, um, because when I was a kid, there"
"14501810","14508570"," was still a whole generation that was alive when I was a kid that had, uh, that was alive from"
"14508570","14510330"," coming over in the turn of the century. "
"14511290","14513110"," So they were like, they were like 20 years old."
"14513250","14516750"," They were like 70 when I was a kid, 80s, 70s, 60s."
"14517290","14519970"," They'd come over in the turn of the century to the US. "
"14521610","14523390"," And so I'm fascinated by that, that conversation."
"14523850","14531270"," I was like, I was like, these people are from, uh, the Middle East, but they remind me of Irish"
"14531270","14532790"," Catholics that came to the United States."
"14533870","14535230"," And I just found it very fascinating. "
"14539190","14541250"," You parrot, your folks are from low and drink it."
"14541370","14541490"," Nice."
"14541810","14546430"," My dad was, uh, my dad was in the military, but he traveled a lot. "
"14546430","14550210"," And we spent time in, uh, in Boston, Massachusetts."
"14559830","14566710"," And I just wonder if you're from the, if you're from the Yorker, Boston, if you're older, do you"
"14566710","14570230"," notice that those, some of those same, uh, parallels?"
"14571450","14572330"," I notice it."
"14576250","14576890"," Oh, yeah. "
"14576990","14577170"," I love it."
"14577290","14577870"," You live in Hanscom."
"14577970","14578130"," Nice. "
"14584480","14587640"," Bouncing on S one right now, five, 11, 11."
"14589520","14592780"," I need my fucking put spreads to go to like 490."
"14598000","14600080"," They got a shit ton of put spreads. "
"14604850","14605750"," Okay, hold on a break back."
"14605890","14606970"," Give me five seconds, guys."
"14607090","14607690"," I'm right back, guys. "
"14632330","14633270"," I'll be right back with you guys."
"14633370","14633770"," Give me a second."
"16574590","16575150"," Holy shit. "
"16575230","16576410"," Am I going to make a ton of money here?"
"16576630","16578050"," What the fuck is going on?"
"16580500","16581900"," Am I going to make a bunch of money?"
"16587950","16588730"," Hold on here."
"16591980","16593599"," Am I going to fucking get rich?"
"16599599","16605259"," I'm in the, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to fight a fire here in the background, and it wasn't paid"
"16605259","16605779"," attention."
"16610849","16612369"," Holy fucking shit. "
"16621939","16623419"," Yeah, I'm not doing that well."
"16623599","16624259"," I'm not doing that good."
"16624400","16629540"," I'm still down like, uh, I'm down about 65% in the position. "
"16632500","16635099"," We have to, we'd have to, they're going to pin this, I think."
"16635320","16636220"," I think they're going to pin it."
"16636680","16645029"," I'm not like, yeah, they're draining me right now, too, dude. "
"16645270","16645770"," They're draining me."
"16648009","16649730"," I'm still down pretty big."
"16650849","16652450"," Yeah, they're 10 cents right now. "
"16652710","16655110"," I would have, we would have to go to this number right here."
"16655550","16659650"," And even if we did, by the time we get there, they'll likely torch it to like zero."
"16660750","16663770"," They're going to trap because I bought that right there that they got me trapped. "
"16664070","16665410"," I did DCA here."
"16667270","16668930"," May I DCA at 20 cents?"
"16671009","16675470"," So I mean, I'm, my DCA is pretty good, but I'm going to watch it though."
"16675669","16678610"," I mean, if they do, if they were to rip this up, this would be fucking crazy. "
"16680410","16686450"," If they run this shit up and we go to fucking, if they go to fucking 520, I will fucking"
"16686450","16688950"," rip my pants off and run around the office naked."
"16698490","16699669"," Hold on one second here."
"16704050","16705550"," Hold on, hold on, hold on. "
"16705630","16707970"," I got to get my, okay, I got to tell you guys something."
"16708169","16708369"," Hold on."
"16708529","16709750"," I got to go back and do this. "
"16710169","16710730"," Hold on once."
"16711029","16712230"," Where the fuck is this thing?"
"16713570","16716290"," Okay, so listen, I got to take care of something right now."
"16716490","16718590"," I'm in the middle of like, I got to take care of something right now. "
"16724450","16725610"," No fucking way."
"16728950","16735849"," Here I am talking about volatility, but if they saw this, man, if they rip this up there, holy"
"16735849","16737290"," shit, where's that?"
"16740779","16742080"," 51, 97?"
"16743080","16744439"," Get the fuck on out of here."
"16760220","16761680"," Alright, I'm adding more right now. "
"16762380","16763040"," I just added some more."
"16763980","16765860"," I hope they don't, what's already 228?"
"16766160","16766919"," So I just added some more."
"16767360","16769919"," I just added fucking 25 more contracts at 10 cents. "
"16770439","16771619"," Fuck these motherfuckers."
"16771720","16772360"," I'm making all my money."
"16772419","16772960"," Oh shit. "
"16774720","16776740"," I'm gonna try to make my money back here."
"16779260","16780720"," Alright, here's the deal though."
"16784360","16785780"," I have to do this. "
"16785980","16786380"," I don't have a choice."
"16786780","16787600"," So I'll be here."
"16788420","16790160"," I'm gonna put on some music for you. "
"16791380","16793040"," I got to take care of this right now."
"16793040","16793460"," I don't have a choice."
"16804610","16805830"," Hold on one second here. "
"16808170","16810910"," I'm gonna put on some, what am I gonna put on here for you?"
"16812590","16815370"," I'm gonna put CNBC on and see if at least got something going on."
"16816030","16817450"," I can't, I have to do this."
"16817590","16817870"," I have a choice. "
"16818450","16819910"," It has to do with the technical side of the website."
"16820690","16822050"," The discord, I got to make sure it's all working."
"16822470","16825930"," If you just want a quick second, I'll be right back with you guys in just a few minutes. "
"16831510","16832470"," That is crazy."
"16833510","16836750"," That energy, which shows how large the largest players have now become."
"16836990","16838930"," You can see Exxon and Pioneer. "
"16839130","16840030"," Alright, I will be here."
"16840250","16841930"," I'm here, but I have to be in the background."
"16841930","16847170"," There followed by Chevron, Diamondback and Endeavour as well as Oxie and Crown Rock. "
"16847350","16852610"," And now looking forward, more than 60% of the remaining drilling resources in the perimeter."
"16852650","16855590"," If we start, if we start to rip, yell at me."
"16855930","16858750"," Like, say something and chatter something because I got to get this done. "
"16859030","16860170"," Like, I got to focus on this."
"16860630","16862550"," All within the global upstream sector."
"16862750","16868370"," So as you can see there, average market cap has about doubled over the last decade for the S&P"
"16868370","16869030"," energy constituents. "
"16869030","16873170"," While the number of companies in the sector has been all but cut in half."
"16873450","16878350"," And so that's again created this extreme concentration with Exxon and Chevron now making up about"
"16878350","16880710"," 43% of the overall market cap."
"16881070","16884190"," And also we have to remember that energy has been very much out of favour. "
"16884730","16887690"," And so it's hard to attract new money into the sector."
"16888070","16892790"," And if you are a generalist investor with a very small allocation, you're going to focus on the"
"16892790","16895390"," biggest names simply because that's what you know."
"16895390","16899230"," However, and there's always a however, this also creates opportunity. "
"16899630","16903590"," Sir Rob Thummel said that investors should look beyond just these upstream players."
"16903610","16907390"," They should look at things like gas and focus on EQT, Chesapeake."
"16907950","16912630"," Dan Pickering said that if in one energy comes back into favour, investors will look further down"
"16912630","16915330"," market cap names like Permian Resources, Vital Energy. "
"16915890","16919010"," So concentration, everyone flooding into the same names can also create opportunity."
"16919010","16924930"," Did you say in terms of acreage, Exxon and Pioneer have the most acreage out there?"
"16925170","16926830"," And who's next and next?"
"16927150","16927210"," Exactly."
"16927670","16930570"," So they're both the biggest thrillers in the Permian once that deal goes through. "
"16930690","16933090"," And then they also have the longest term looking forward."
"16933230","16934650"," They have the most undrilled locations."
"16934850","16938910"," And that's what's really important because now that, you know, shale has been around for some time,"
"16939230","16940890"," all the best locations have been drilled. "
"16941170","16945290"," And so the ones that are still the most profitable where you get the most bang for your buck are"
"16945290","16945570"," dwindling."
"16945570","16951170"," And so that's why companies are focused on specific companies within specific basins within the"
"16951170","16951510"," Permian."
"16951790","16956170"," You really want that prime acreage to show investors, show Wall Street, that you can continue to"
"16956170","16959070"," grow your production looking forward without spending heavily on new exploration. "
"16959490","16964510"," As we look at the production there, you can see that Exxon and Pioneer are way ahead of the others."
"16964670","16968130"," The others are kind of bunched, but they're not insignificant, but bunched."
"16968650","16968970"," Pippa, thanks. "
"16969890","16972590"," Alright, shall we go to Bertha Coombs for CNBC News Update?"
"16972850","16973050"," Why not?"
"16973050","16974210"," Hi, why not?"

"17047870","17050650"," Yes, how much of it do we believe?"
"17050950","17052210"," There will be plenty of suspicions there. "

"17259360","17260140"," And thanks for joining us."
"17260220","17261460"," I guess we'll start there. "
"17261700","17266100"," What gave you the impetus to want to raise your S&P 500 forecast?"
"17267060","17269220"," Well, earnings came in better than expected."
"17269780","17272980"," We've been of the belief that earnings were troffing and growing."
"17273780","17278560"," And what's really amazing is that with the higher interest rate environment that we've been in,"
"17278680","17283720"," with the inflation environment we've been able to be in, you know, margins have actually been able"
"17283720","17284760"," to slightly expand. "
"17285500","17288380"," In addition to that, we're seeing stocks respond."
"17289380","17295360"," And I'm seeing moves that I have not seen in decades in terms of price behavior."
"17295900","17297640"," And not just here in the United States. "
"17297760","17299360"," There's something going on globally."
"17300140","17304980"," We have Japan breaking out to a record all time high that we haven't seen in 34 years."
"17305420","17311540"," We're seeing your breakout to all time highs, even though their economy still remained pretty weak. "
"17311540","17314940"," Even Australia broke out to record all time highs."
"17315500","17321540"," So there really seems to be a global momentum that is really benefiting markets."
"17322840","17329020"," And I wouldn't be surprised if markets are factoring in how AI is going to add productivity to"
"17329020","17329400"," businesses. "
"17330060","17332720"," And that's going to trickle down into earnings for companies."
"17333220","17336620"," But we still have two sizable events that you sort of didn't mention."
"17336620","17337480"," We've got the election. "
"17337960","17342440"," And of course, whatever the Fed decides to do for the rest of the year, how does that factor in"
"17342440","17347480"," the S&P 500 under 52 hundred right now, 58 hundred, a long way to go from there."
"17348380","17354300"," So with the election, I understand people are very passionate about their candidate."
"17354740","17357660"," But at the end of the day, it's about earnings. "
"17358580","17364220"," And when we look at the legislation that President Biden has put into place between the"
"17364220","17370660"," infrastructure act, the chips act and the inflation protection act, that is adding to businesses"
"17370660","17371480"," bottom line."
"17371780","17373500"," I think that's baked in for this year."
"17373640","17380460"," That's another reason why I have confidence that markets can go higher and getting to the ability"
"17380460","17382140"," for the Fed to be able to cut rates. "
"17382160","17383560"," We had jobs data today."
"17384020","17387800"," I think that data had something for the bulls and something for the bears."
"17387840","17389660"," I think it's really a Goldilocks. "
"17389660","17395980"," I do think that the Fed will do a checkmark that will give them the ability to eventually cut"
"17395980","17396200"," rates."
"17396200","17398260"," I think they want a little bit more data."
"17398820","17405160"," So maybe as we move into more of the summer months, like going into June, we may actually see rate"
"17405160","17405460"," cuts. "
"17405720","17408600"," And that will be also very positive, I think, for the markets."
"17409100","17414320"," If I'm reading my notes right, you're basically saying go with the Mo and the Mo as in momentum has"
"17414320","17416020"," been growth, big cap and tech."
"17416020","17420840"," Why do you favor those areas over value and smaller cap?"
"17421340","17423860"," You know, Tyler, that's a phenomenal question. "
"17424320","17426160"," I believe we're in a secular bull market."
"17426560","17429400"," Secular bull markets last 15 to 20 years."
"17429820","17433720"," And you have to look at the leadership and where that leadership is because that's going to"
"17433720","17435800"," maintain throughout that secular trend. "
"17436200","17437860"," And that's the technology sector."
"17438540","17443420"," And when you dive down into that, I know we keep talking about the magnificent seven, the mag four."
"17443420","17444620"," It used to be fang. "
"17445160","17451340"," It really is semiconductors and I'm keeping my eye on the semiconductor space as the major"
"17451340","17451880"," leadership."
"17452340","17454900"," And I still think we're going to see significant highs."
"17455120","17461900"," So I do think that there is a pivotal change that's coming from artificial intelligence or AI that"
"17461900","17464880"," we're all trying to learn and factor in. "
"17465160","17467700"," So those are my thoughts on that space."
"17467700","17470440"," Just pointing out we have to leave it there."
"17470760","17476540"," I'm sorry to say, Marianne, but meta advanced micro and Taiwan semi are among your picks in that"
"17476540","17476740"," area. "
"17476740","17478400"," It doesn't get much bigger than those."
"17478760","17481580"," I said, I still like the mega caps."
"17481680","17483540"," I still think this is going to stay mega caps. "
"17484000","17488460"," When you still have scarcity of earnings growth outperforms value."
"17488460","17493760"," And I think as long as the banks struggling here, especially with concern around regulation,"
"17493800","17496440"," although it looked like Powell died that back a little bit."
"17496440","17498880"," I think that's going to put a cap on financials. "
"17498960","17503600"," And I don't think you can have a strong rally in value without the banks."
"17503900","17504980"," All right, Marianne Bartels."
"17505220","17505660"," Thank you very much. "
"17505740","17507600"," Thanks, Jerry wealth, chief investment officer."
"17508100","17513300"," Still ahead, streaming strikes, snubs, Hollywood's tumultuous year coming to an end, but not"
"17513300","17514700"," without some major recognition."
"17515360","17521200"," Julia Borsden will give us her 2024 red carpet report from the Oscars. "
"17521960","17522420"," That's next."
"17706330","17707530"," The theaters now."
"17708450","17711490"," At that time of the year again, the Oscars are on Sunday night. "
"17711710","17716750"," So what does it all mean for the movie industry and the media giants are Julia Borsden joins us now"
"17716750","17717330"," with the latest?"
"17717530","17719230"," I definitely need your expertise and rundown."
"17719590","17720810"," I got to win my Oscar poll."
"17720930","17722210"," I got to get that in soon, Julia. "
"17724090","17725010"," That's right, Courtney."
"17725150","17725530"," Well, I'm here."
"17725870","17728630"," I'm on the red carpet, but it's covered by white plastic. "
"17729170","17733950"," And this year's Oscars on Sunday come at a pivotal time for the entertainment industry as concerns"
"17733950","17739290"," about AI ripple through Hollywood with big questions about the potential impact of new generative"
"17739290","17741350"," AI tools such as open AI, Sora."
"17741350","17746490"," And while the debut of Warner Brothers do two last week and doubled the domestic and opening of the"
"17746490","17751210"," first installment, it's already surpassed $200 million worldwide in just six days."
"17751570","17756810"," It comes as the box up as year to date is still down 13% from last year's numbers. "
"17757490","17762730"," So now investors and industry watchers are looking ahead and wondering if the studios have any"
"17762730","17768930"," franchises that could yield a surprise like last year's bourbon timer or whether the box office"
"17768930","17771470"," will continue a decline from pre pandemic levels."
"17772110","17778230"," So now the races on for the traditional studios and the streamers to prove the critical value of"
"17778230","17782710"," their content investments with the awards that are key for attracting top talent."
"17783190","17788490"," Now, going into the Oscars, Disney studios have the most nominations 20, including for its films"
"17788490","17794030"," for things while Netflix has 16 and bolstered by Bradley Cooper's Maestro, which has seven"
"17794030","17794410"," nominations. "
"17794410","17800770"," Universal has 18 nominations led by Oppenheimer and the holdovers followed by Apple with 13 and"
"17800770","17802850"," Warner Brothers with nine for Barbie."
"17803590","17806090"," But Oppenheimer is expected to sweep the show."
"17806210","17811870"," It has the most nominations of any film with 13 total followed by poor things with 11 and killers"
"17811870","17814590"," of Flower Moon from Apple TV with 10. "
"17814590","17820050"," And with the blockbuster performance of Oppenheimer and also Barbie, ABC is hoping to keep up the"
"17820050","17821030"," ratings rebound."
"17821590","17826450"," The last two years saw a bump in viewership for the Oscars after the show hit an all time low"
"17826450","17827030"," in 2021."
"17827730","17828330"," Back over to you. "
"17829210","17834370"," Well, what about the, I mean, I'm amazed that we now consider Netflix and Apple studios."
"17834410","17837770"," I mean, that's tells you all you need to know about the transition in the world."
"17837770","17840870"," I could have Oppenheimer could have been a little longer for me. "
"17841150","17842750"," It was only three hours and a quarter."
"17843330","17848190"," But is the betting that Oppenheimer is going to sweep the table here pretty close to?"
"17849970","17851390"," Yeah, I mean, that's the expectation."
"17851770","17856670"," If you just look at the critical acclaim of the movie and it really sort of hits all the key"
"17856670","17860510"," boxes when it comes to an Oscar movie, you have some epic performances. "
"17860510","17866870"," It's based on a very famous book or very successful book, as well as the fact that it's really"
"17866870","17869590"," touching on some key issues for society."
"17869950","17872690"," It's really expected to get a lot of votes there."
"17873010","17877590"," And then, of course, there's some concern that Barbie though nominated for Best Picture did not see"
"17877590","17879690"," Greta Gerwig nominated for Best Director. "
"17880050","17881890"," A lot of people have said about that, including myself."
"17882350","17884650"," I thought that was a really phenomenal film."
"17884650","17890190"," So I think we've had these two movies last year that really defined the summer, defined the box"
"17890190","17890530"," office. "
"17890890","17893290"," I think people are going to be tuning in to see how it all turns out."
"17894030","17894570"," All right, Julia."
"17894810","17895250"," We'll be watching. "
"17895610","17896110"," Thanks so much."

"18105790","18107890"," So, Gina, what's your trade on Biogen?"
"18109130","18111050"," So we're still a sell on Biogen."
"18111290","18116610"," This is a tough one because there was a lot of expectation going into the launch of the Alzheimer's"
"18116610","18125490"," drug, Lekimbi, and the challenge there was that they have their sales did not meet expectations."
"18126110","18127190"," So they underperformed there. "
"18127610","18131810"," They argued that they had patient access issues and other logistical issues."
"18132490","18136930"," The postpartum depression drug also has not performed as expected."

"18149530","18150950"," All right, let's move on next."
"18151190","18152250"," So that one is a sell. "
"18152910","18154050"," Let's move next to DocuSign."

"18173030","18176610"," The challenge to DocuSign was that it was a pandemic darling."
"18176790","18180470"," It came out when having to sign things remotely was a challenge. "
"18180470","18185630"," They came out with a very, you know, nice, beautiful, slick, simple product."
"18185990","18192930"," The problem was was that Adobe quickly cut onto that train, and Adobe Sign has really proven a"
"18192930","18198370"," significant competitor, and quite frankly, a much more mature ecosystem that Adobe has built out."
"18198710","18204670"," So DocuSign has actually done better than I would have expected because they have continued. "
"18204670","18210550"," They have kept their base of customers, and they are continuing to focus on operations."
"18211090","18217550"," What could get me more excited would be to see them continue to improve and expand the product, but"
"18217550","18220290"," they are doing everything that you should see."
"18220470","18223130"," They're building a solid base, and their margins are now positive. "
"18223670","18228730"," So this is all good stuff for DocuSign, but I think we need to see a little more to get"
"18228730","18229170"," really excited."
"18229170","18233870"," Okay, so you like it, but you're giving this one a neutral DocuSign is higher by 5% in today."
"18234230","18235970"," Finally, we have shares of Gap Gap. "
"18236190","18241210"," Ink shares are popping after the company's holiday earnings beat analysts' expectations, and Old"
"18241210","18244050"," Navy return to growth for the first time in over a year."
"18244570","18250250"," The stock's still down in 2024 despite today's move, but shares are up more than 80% over the past"
"18250250","18251110"," six months."
"18251790","18253630"," Gina, where did Gap shares go from here?"
"18253810","18256950"," Obviously they've got a new CEO and sort of reworking the strategy. "
"18256950","18265210"," Yeah, so we're a buy here, and clearly the new CEO is getting things done, but there's actually a"
"18265210","18270270"," big broader move across retail, and Gap is a beneficiary of that, and they are benefiting from"
"18270270","18275970"," feeding into the trends, and so they're making the right moves idiosyncratically, but the broader"
"18275970","18280430"," move in retail is very strong, and we think that that's being lifted by two things."
"18280750","18286050"," Number one, you see positive real wage growth continuing, and so people are making more than"
"18286050","18290370"," inflation in their wage growth, and that is clearly benefiting retail."
"18290850","18295330"," There was a lot of conservative guidance, in fact, going into Q4, and they smashed that guidance"
"18295330","18300810"," and were able to provide less conservative guidance going forward, so that tells you that those"
"18300810","18305310"," wages are feeding into retail sales, and the inflation trends still continue to fall. "
"18305690","18311050"," Yes, we saw that up tick in PPI, but margins are expanding, and Gap in particular has seen margin"
"18311050","18315150"," expansion, and so those two things are going to benefit Gap, but it's going to benefit the broad"
"18315150","18315670"," industry."
"18315910","18317890"," Yeah, the margins were particularly impressive there."
"18318010","18321790"," They said they're trying to keep their promos under control, and the CEO said to me, and I just"
"18321790","18325710"," have to read this quote, because I think this was funny, he said, we devolved from a pulp culture"
"18325710","18329450"," brand to a clothing retailer, today we're getting our vibe back. "
"18329710","18330310"," All right."
"18330590","18331070"," I like that."
"18331510","18331990"," All right. "
"18332270","18333130"," Gina, thanks very much."
"18333330","18334370"," Gina Sanchez, have a great weekend."
"18335470","18336070"," Thank you. "
"18336550","18337290"," We'll stay right here."
"18337630","18340030"," Power lunch is coming up next with a little bit more."
"18526330","18527850"," We're going to get three minutes left in the show. "
"18528030","18529350"," A couple more stories you need to know about."
"18529450","18530290"," Let's get right to it."
"18530490","18534050"," Shares of amblings, pharmaceuticals, plummeting 80% today. "
"18534230","18539450"," After the company said it's ALS treatment, failed phase three trials, and the company may withdraw"
"18539450","18540810"," the drug from the market."
"18541250","18546990"," Co-CEOs Justin Clay and Joshua Cohen said they are surprised and deeply disappointed by the trial"
"18546990","18547330"," results."
"18547630","18548550"," This was an interesting one. "
"18548910","18554670"," The FDA had initially and controversially approved this drug for use against ALS in a second stage"
"18554670","18558670"," trial, but now the drug has failed a stage three trial."
"18558970","18560390"," The company is now suspending it."
"18560990","18564130"," Regulators in Europe had similarly withdrawn approval from the drug. "
"18564290","18567050"," Frustrating for everyone in the ALS community for certain."
"18567490","18571590"," And a potential scandal brewing in college basketball, U.S. integrity, which is the gambling"
"18571590","18576850"," watchdog flag yesterday's game between UAB and Temple for unusual activity."
"18577450","18580730"," The game opened with UAB listed as a one and a half point favorite. "
"18580730","18585450"," That spread ballooned as high as eight before closing with UAB favored by seven."
"18585690","18590070"," At this point, no one is alleging any wrongdoing, but a move like that is very unusual."
"18590670","18591190"," So what happened?"
"18591390","18595550"," Maybe like what happens in the options of market, people see a lot of action on one side and decide"
"18595550","18596750"," to follow the sharp money. "
"18597130","18601990"," More nefarious possibilities though do include someone knowing non-public information about one of"
"18601990","18605050"," the teams or, in the worst case scenario, point shaving."
"18605390","18608970"," UAB did cover the inflated spread, winning the game 172."
"18609710","18615130"," CNBC reached out to Temple and the NCAA both say they are reviewing it but can't comment. "
"18615530","18617470"," This opens up a lot of questions as sports betting."
"18618130","18623970"," The betting on college basketball, all kinds of college football, pro sports is just really growing"
"18623970","18624430"," amazingly."
"18625470","18629810"," And it does open up suspicions sometimes when you see a spread move like that. "
"18630030","18631270"," That's a strange move."
"18631830","18633130"," Today is equal pay day."
"18633370","18637810"," The date that symbolizes how far into the year women must work to earn what men earned in the"
"18637810","18638770"," previous year. "
"18639330","18644370"," Women in the US earned about 20% less than men, 83.6 cents on the dollar on average in"
"18644370","18645070"," 2023."
"18645570","18646810"," That's according to the labor department."
"18647330","18651810"," That amounts to a difference of $10,000 a year, about a half a million dollars throughout a career. "
"18652390","18655070"," The gap is even bigger for many women of color."
"18655410","18662110"," The gender pay gap is slowly closing, narrowing from 82.1 cents a decade ago."
"18662370","18664910"," We're making progress, but we're still up there. "
"18664910","18666170"," It is an international women's day."
"18666330","18669110"," It is slow progress, but obviously an important thing."
"18669350","18669690"," It is. "
"18669890","18671470"," Alright folks, we're going to leave it right there."
"18671690","18673090"," Thanks for watching Powerlunch today."
"18673270","18676290"," The market's a little bit tepid reacting to the job report. "
"18676610","18677810"," Thanks for watching Powerlunch."
"18677910","18678570"," Happy Friday."
"18679030","18680670"," Closing Bell starts right now. "
"18684950","18685830"," Well, thank you very much."
"18685850","18686630"," Welcome to Closing Bell."
"18686770","18689730"," I'm Scott Walker on this Friday Live from post 9 here at the New York Stock Exchange. "
"18690410","18692390"," And this make or break hour begins with a chip wreck."
"18692570","18697910"," The semis are sliding in video staging a stunning intraday reversal, and all of it raising new"
"18697910","18702050"," questions about whether one of the best trades in the market simply got too frothy."
"18702190","18705830"," We're going to ask our experts over this final stretch, including the Wharton School's Jeremy"
"18705830","18706290"," Segal. "
"18706410","18709870"," He will join us momentarily to weigh in on that and the rally at large."
"18710250","18712710"," In the meantime, your scorecard was 60 minutes to go."
"18713170","18715010"," In regulation of this week looks like this. "
"18715150","18717490"," NASDAQ is clearly the pain point today."
"18717530","18720450"," Several of the mega cap names face more selling pressure."
"18721090","18724490"," The NASDAQ 100's been off by more than 1% for much of the day. "
"18724490","18729030"," Even as Apple and Alphabet have been bucking the trend, and that is a rarity, as you know."
"18729370","18731250"," Take a look at the semi-index."
"18731590","18735970"," It is getting smoked at this hour off more than, well, just about 3%. "
"18735970","18736950"," That is the SMA."
"18736950","18738370"," The socks is down big."
"18738710","18742630"," Names like beyond NVIDIA are facing some serious selling pressure. "
"18743190","18744850"," Broadcom is down sharply after its earnings."
"18745110","18747270"," Marvell is one of the worst names in the space today."
"18747510","18749790"," And that's after its own quarterly earnings report. "
"18750310","18752910"," AMD, KLA, C, you get my drift."
"18753190","18753770"," They're all lower."
"18753770","18755830"," And it does take us to our talk of the tape. "
"18756030","18756390"," Bubble trouble."
"18757090","18761030"," And whether the one soaring semis are now in danger of an even bigger pullback."
"18761490","18764130"," Let's ask star chip analyst Stacey Raskin of Bernstein. "
"18764470","18766070"," He does join us now."
"18766170","18766970"," It's good to have you back."
"18767470","18771510"," It is stunning to watch what's taking place today in this market. "
"18771590","18775370"," Stacey, NVIDIA, a $100 intraday move."
"18776310","18777350"," Almost 10%."
"18777350","18778470"," What do you make of it?"
"18778930","18779510"," A lot. "
"18779830","18787010"," I was joking earlier that maybe somebody's just a little too close to the sun for a bit."
"18787110","18788970"," I mean, like, semis have still had a monster year."
"18789090","18790310"," They're up 20% year to date. "
"18790510","18794110"," They're up 70% something like that year over year."
"18794990","18797490"," NVIDIA itself is up 80% year to date still."
"18797590","18798630"," It's like, I don't worry too much. "
"18799190","18800470"," Some of this is probably kicked off."
"18800690","18802610"," We had Marvell in Broadcom report last night."
"18803030","18807470"," Actually, their AI revenues were quite strong, but the core businesses were not so good for either"
"18807470","18807890"," of them. "
"18808370","18811310"," Enterprise spending and the like carrier spending are not great."
"18812270","18813870"," I think that kind of weighs on it."
"18813970","18817610"," Then people, I think we're just looking at NVIDIA in particular, getting awfully close to that sort"
"18817610","18820930"," of magical, you know, $4,000 kind of number. "
"18821510","18824670"," Maybe there's a little bit of profit taking, and it kind of sets everything else down."
"18824850","18829310"," But like, I'll be honest, on a noisy day like this, I don't read too much into it."
"18829430","18832330"," Like, is it the space is still had a monster year?"
"18832810","18836830"," I still think some of the markets, especially the AI-related markets still have legs to them. "
"18836830","18838230"," I think those still have room."
"18838650","18840270"," Now we can talk about some of the other markets."
"18840510","18846070"," I do want to do that a moment, but when you say something like the core businesses of these"
"18846070","18854210"," companies, for the ones that reported not so good, this market has ignored, in many respects, the"
"18854210","18859950"," core businesses of many of these companies, and they've gotten this AI halo from NVIDIA. "
"18860370","18867110"," Did we overdo it in giving too much of a bump relative to AI when it's not that big a"
"18867110","18869670"," part of business for many of these other chip players?"
"18870430","18871670"," Yes, possibly."
"18872050","18879190"," In my coverage there are two names that actually have meaningful AI that's more than just a story"
"18879190","18881570"," that's actually contributing meaningfully to their numbers."
"18881710","18886710"," It's NVIDIA and Broadcom, and not a whole lot of others, right?"
"18886930","18890930"," Again, you can even look at an AMD, and AMD is doing really well, but as a percentage of the"
"18890930","18894110"," revenue, it's not that big, and it has not been enough to offset weakness. "
"18894970","18896110"," The stock's been great."
"18896350","18899790"," Don't get me wrong, but again, these missed numbers like every quarter for the last year."
"18900330","18905150"," You got names like Marvella last night where, again, the forward guidance was very weak. "
"18905370","18907130"," You know, AI was not enough to make up the difference."
"18907690","18908890"," Broadcom was kind of the opposite."
"18909230","18915090"," Broadcom took maybe two and a half billion dollars of incremental headwind out of their core"
"18915090","18923070"," business versus last quarter, but their AI business was stronger by exactly the same amount. "
"18923070","18928610"," And because of that, like our Broadcom numbers last night went up, not down on the back of all"
"18928610","18928710"," this."
"18928830","18932830"," So there are some names that I think are actually benefiting very well, but yeah, there are others"
"18932830","18937930"," where it is more of a story or a narrative, and we have yet to see it really influencing the"
"18937930","18939030"," numbers to a great degree."
"18939410","18944870"," You make the point very well here for something like an AMD, a miss, a miss, a miss, a miss,"
"18945650","18947250"," and the stock and up and up and up and up. "
"18947470","18950550"," I mean, it's up 113% since November 1st."
"18950550","18954970"," What kind of re-rating is needed in some of these names?"
"18955370","18963270"," If you suggest that, you know, the fundamentals that these companies have been so rewarded on are"
"18963270","18966510"," good, obviously, but come on."
"18966770","18970650"," I mean, we've been giving insane gains to these names. "
"18971350","18975790"," Yeah, it's funny that the ones that are succeeding, the valuations are not crazy."
"18976070","18981670"," And again, I've made this point a number of times with you, but like Nvidia, if they can actually"
"18981670","18985310"," deliver what people are thinking they can, the stock is not expensive, right?"
"18985350","18987610"," It's actually much cheaper than it was before this all started."
"18988290","18993590"," Even Broadcom report was, I mean Broadcom is more expensive versus its own history, but it's"
"18993590","18995790"," trading right now in maybe the mid 20s. "
"18995830","18999510"," I mean, the entire SOCK index is in the low 30s, right?"
"19000530","19004250"," You've got some of these other names though, where, like I said, the AIP or whatever they have has"
"19004250","19007330"," not been enough to offset, and I throw a lot of the analogs into those names."
"19007490","19008770"," They've just been cutting numbers like crazy."
"19009650","19013590"," The stocks just really haven't gone down, and like the multiples are very, very high for like a lot"
"19013590","19015110"," of the folks in the space right now. "
"19015110","19018770"," And at some point, you know, we do need fundamentals to start to pick up."
"19018950","19022470"," This is what's been going on, by the way, like people have been buying the cuts broadly in the"
"19022470","19024650"," space, which is a normal thing to do in semis."
"19024910","19028930"," You tend to want to buy them when there's blood in the streets, but usually the stocks go down"
"19028930","19030810"," before you buy them. "
"19030870","19034850"," And in this case, like the numbers have been cut and the stocks, maybe they didn't rip in some of"
"19034850","19036870"," these, but they didn't really go down either."
"19037530","19041230"," And yet people have been buying those cuts anyways, and so it would be very interesting to see what"
"19041230","19041590"," happens."
"19042490","19046130"," Hopefully as we get into the second afternoon, the next year numbers do start to pick up. "
"19046430","19049010"," Do the stocks actually go up as the estimates start to go up?"
"19049050","19050310"," Do the multiples just start to come down?"
"19050450","19053910"," Like I don't know yet, but the tip of the practice would be that the multiples come down."
"19054130","19056470"," I mean, that's the normal kind of cyclical investment behavior."
"19056990","19058770"," I feel like this is a bit of a loaded question. "
"19059090","19062050"," Have you ever seen anything like an Nvidia go up?"
"19062830","19066030"," By this magnitude almost every day."
"19066570","19070410"," I preface that and I say it's loaded because you say, well, I mean Qualcomm in 99 and some of"
"19070410","19077330"," these other names had these unbelievable moves, but this one seems unique and it seems different."
"19078030","19084070"," And when you begin a week where a stock is like 850 and it ends the week at 950, or"
"19084070","19086230"," maybe eight in a couple days it hits that level. "
"19086230","19089670"," Then today obviously you hit a breaking point of some respects."
"19090490","19093450"," And I've been doing this a long time, but I wasn't doing it in 99."
"19095310","19101610"," You know, look, I think for an at scale company like Nvidia, you haven't seen too much of these"
"19101610","19102830"," kinds of like, at least not consistently. "
"19104030","19104050"," Right?"
"19104230","19104930"," You're going to have moments."
"19105250","19108690"," I mean, meta have this idea while that where we're on the earnings at Spike."
"19109010","19113730"," But you have this kind of like consistent like upward pressure or upward bias on it. "
"19114490","19117930"," These stocks move this much where these stocks were already have like a trillion dollar market cap."
"19117930","19122750"," Like I'm not sure that I've seen anything like that in for something to ask."
"19122850","19126970"," I've been smaller, you know, like like small fat stocks sure they can move like this, but for"
"19126970","19131170"," something that's like as big as Nvidia's like this is, again, I've been doing this job 16 years. "
"19131830","19133470"," I'm not sure I've seen anything quite like this one before."
"19133850","19136070"," Steve, Stacy, we're going to make that the last word."
"19136170","19136970"," I appreciate it very much. "
"19137330","19139230"," Thank you so much for helping us break this all down."
"19139750","19140230"," Quite interesting."

"19146010","19147070"," Mike Santoli as well."
"19147230","19149050"," You fells have seen a lot of markets too."
"19149970","19151830"," Michael, you just heard what Stacy said. "
"19151990","19154150"," I don't think I've ever seen anything like this in 16 years."
"19154630","19154770"," You?"
"19154990","19157790"," Yeah, I mean, I actually was doing whatever I'm doing now in 99."
"19157870","19163810"," So I remember the vertical moves in Qualcomm and also more the dynamics of it, which is once"
"19163810","19166030"," everybody collectively says, you know what?"
"19166430","19171570"," This unbelievable world changing fundamental story looks like it's grounded in some reality and we"
"19171570","19176150"," can actually, you know, when they reported the numbers, Nvidia did last time. "
"19176150","19177970"," And the guidance was fine."
"19178430","19178930"," It was like, great."
"19179130","19179850"," We got three more months. "
"19180010","19184530"," We don't have to worry about that moment coming when we have to decide that it's all over hyped."
"19184810","19189470"," Now, I agree that the stock has gotten cheaper because estimates have gone up so much."
"19189790","19196850"," But there's not really any precedent for $2.2 trillion market cap companies sustaining even mid 30"
"19196850","19198310"," P.E. I mean, it could happen. "
"19198450","19199110"," This could be the one."
"19200090","19202230"," And, you know, big isn't what it used to be."
"19202510","19206590"," I mean, in terms of, you know, $2.2 trillion maybe is now more routine. "
"19206790","19208490"," But Microsoft barely got there."
"19208610","19211070"," The point is you have to assume a ton of growth."
"19211290","19216730"," Now, to me, what's more interesting, market-wide, is the way that the momentum trade has been"
"19216730","19224210"," overplayed, almost everybody would say it, that aspect, that characteristic has been so done to the"
"19224210","19226250"," upside that it was going to create some kind of instability. "
"19227170","19229610"," Amazingly, today, it just triggered a rotation."
"19230170","19232510"," A little bit of momentum unwind and guess what?"
"19232690","19237310"," Everyone just bought Apple and Alphabet because they've been the ladders and that supported the S "
"19237310","19237610","&P."
"19237850","19242990"," And so, can you hope that that stays the case, that we magically just hand the baton back and"
"19242990","19243150"," forth?"
"19243470","19243910"," I'm not sure. "
"19244330","19250030"," It comes to the point now where when you look at this Nvidia Halo effect that has shined so"
"19250030","19255470"," brightly on so many of these names, whether it is, you know, look, the Marvelles of the world up 62 "
"19255470","19257970","% since November 1st and ASML 68."
"19258450","19258910"," The entire time."
"19259110","19259910"," I went semi up 71. "
"19260790","19263810"," Not just up, but AMD up 113%."
"19263810","19272190"," You're going to have to now, you know, disseminate, which is legit and which got too much of a"
"19272190","19272390"," Halo."
"19272710","19274050"," That was always going to be the case. "
"19274210","19277630"," Mike and I were sort of looking at charts while you were talking to Stacey."
"19278190","19282810"," The charts, forget the fundamentals, the charts of a whole, I don't want to name them, but we all"
"19282810","19283290"," know what they are."
"19283470","19284610"," They just are unsustainable. "
"19285290","19286250"," I just named them."
"19286250","19287930"," Yes, I am adding the chart to them."
"19288330","19288630"," Thank you. "
"19288890","19290590"," But they just look unsustainable."
"19291050","19294580"," And for those of us that have been in markets for more than 10 minutes, you know when you see"
"19294580","19295500"," a chart that's unsustainable."
"19296080","19297440"," And any number of these charts are unsustainable. "
"19297740","19302740"," But the one thing I will add to the 99 comment, first of all, Qualcomm split like three times in"
"19302740","19304080"," the year and was up 2,000%."
"19304080","19311800"," But besides that, the 99 blow off came after four years or five years of successful build out."
"19312120","19316000"," It wasn't just a promise of the internet by then, although obviously there was much more to come. "
"19316240","19317820"," You started to use the internet."
"19318260","19320500"," It started to be a thing that was available."
"19320500","19325600"," And there was this sense, like taxi drivers were talking about it because they had used the"
"19325600","19325800"," internet. "
"19326280","19331840"," And today, I think the whole Dan Ives argument that you're at the, not just Dan, but you're at the"
"19331840","19334480"," beginning stages of this really can't be said enough."
"19335040","19340120"," If this is going to be what we all think it's going to be, there's years of investment to come"
"19340120","19340720"," down the road."
"19340720","19345820"," And for stocks that, at least in the case of Nvidia, everyone agrees is not too expensive. "
"19346420","19347700"," It's not 100 times GPS."
"19348120","19349040"," It's not 150 times GPS."
"19349040","19352360"," Presumably there are more gains down the road to come for everybody. "
"19352580","19352620"," Sure."
"19352820","19359400"," But in 99, let's just say there were many, many, many companies that were at the beginning or the"
"19359400","19365200"," precipice of the birth of the internet and companies that were, you know, routers and switches."
"19365900","19366860"," All of these other things. "
"19367300","19368500"," And some of them were pretenders."
"19369200","19373140"," And the real ones, in quotes, are around a day."
"19373580","19377240"," But I would argue, and tell me if you think I'm wrong, we just did that. "
"19377240","19381840"," And what you're talking about is the IPO market in 99, which exploded where everybody was trading"
"19381840","19382760"," on nonsense."
"19383340","19388680"," And you could make the case that the SPAC market, which we already blew up, was kind of that."
"19389120","19391560"," It kind of made the IPO market in the late 90s. "
"19391560","19393680"," I don't think, I don't think it's going to match up that well."
"19393760","19400820"," I think the market right now has gone a lot farther in exploiting and pricing in the potential here"
"19400820","19402380"," than certainly 99."
"19402840","19405940"," When the Netscape IPO came out and nobody knew how to even talk about it. "
"19405980","19406220"," That's right."
"19406220","19409540"," So I do think that was also far, by the way, Qualcomm."
"19409940","19416140"," People didn't, the mobile phone penetration was not really high by the time that thing imploded. "
"19416440","19421100"," So I just don't think it's the most helpful conversation because it's never going to match up"
"19421100","19421680"," perfectly well."
"19421900","19428620"," Also, as I keep saying, unless you think the NASDAQ's going down 70%, and earnings are going to be"
"19428620","19432400"," caught in half next year for the S&P 500, then stop talking about 2000."
"19432960","19433560"," That's what happens. "
"19433620","19434260"," It's not a good analog."
"19434260","19436340"," There are certain pockets, though."
"19436420","19437960"," It just conjures up thoughts and bubbles. "
"19438240","19438440"," Absolutely."
"19438820","19439300"," Unsustainable."
"19439700","19440200"," Unsustainable. "
"19440840","19445360"," Overheated markets can be overheated without them being historically vulnerable."
"19445820","19451000"," Look, every period of bank upset doesn't have to be the next 2008, but it's the nearest analog in"
"19451000","19456240"," which we look back at some moment of great crisis and we say, wow, hopefully this is not the next"
"19456240","19456540"," that."
"19456980","19458080"," So that's why it's an easy point of reference. "
"19458080","19460260"," But let me just go ahead real quick."
"19460260","19463180"," Chet JVT came out in the fall of 22."
"19464480","19468440"," If we equate it, and I know that you're saying don't equate it, but let's do it for fun, if"
"19468440","19474660"," we equate it to the Netscape IPO, which was in August of 95, then we're in August of 96. "
"19475760","19480160"," I think that the market just goes from A to B a lot faster."
"19480700","19482200"," I mean, Fan was 2013."
"19482940","19483820"," Jim Kramer named it. "
"19484460","19486820"," In 2013, it's 12 years ago."
"19486820","19492240"," So the idea of these platform companies that are just like buy them, you can't pay too high a"
"19492240","19494860"," price, has been very well ingrained for a while."
"19495060","19495720"," What do we want to make?"
"19495920","19498400"," And you referenced money coming out, money going in. "
"19498500","19502740"," Money going into the apples of the world and the alphabets, the one that had been so beaten down,"
"19502880","19506760"," Apple was mostly under 170 for the duration of the week."
"19507360","19510040"," Now it's back above at 172 and change."
"19510580","19515260"," So it's interesting that we can have some, maybe a little bit of froth or whatever it is come out"
"19515260","19517900"," of some of these mega cap names and then go into these other areas. "
"19518060","19521240"," And that's why the market at large hangs in."
"19521560","19526180"," Like today NVIDIA collapses and then the overall market is having a massive problem."
"19526340","19527100"," Today, it didn't happen. "
"19527340","19534100"," I mean, again, it would surprise me if this is going to be the perfect choreography on an ongoing"
"19534100","19539500"," basis, but until the macro really breaks down, until you really have to question the important"
"19539500","19543020"," stuff, which is this expansion in good shape seems like it is."
"19543020","19546280"," You know, jobs are in a comfortable zone right now based on this morning's numbers."
"19546640","19548260"," Credit, unshakable. "
"19548700","19551800"," So all that stuff is nothing you have to worry about in the moment."
"19551980","19554120"," So it becomes more about the internal market mechanics."
"19554720","19556400"," There's massive volume in NVIDIA today. "
"19556780","19559140"," It's going to trade $100 billion worth of stock today."
"19559700","19559880"," Okay."
"19560180","19566400"," So maybe that's a short-term basis, pretty decisive to say the market's same kind of we got enough"
"19566400","19566760"," for now. "
"19566840","19568780"," And let me add, it's not just the semis."
"19569020","19574820"," When you look at who's down most today, it's a number of charts Costco, Constellation Energy,"
"19575320","19581940"," William Sonoma, Wingstop, stocks that are up, triple digit percentages trading at mid-double-digit"
"19582440","19584200"," multiples that are all off today."
"19584660","19588680"," Meanwhile, you've still got Visa and MasterCard positive on the day, Google and Apple positive on"
"19588680","19593420"," the day, and stepping back from that, you've got eight of 11 sectors in the SME 500 outperforming"
"19593420","19594240"," the index right now. "
"19594700","19598080"," So it's not a market-wide, as you mentioned, destruction."
"19598080","19604620"," There was a period of time a year ago or however long ago, where if you lost the biggest market"
"19604620","19608340"," cap names within the market, you were going to have a big problem."
"19608720","19614500"," There wasn't enough support underneath to carry the market, or at least to hold it for a period of"
"19614500","19614760"," time. "
"19615020","19615760"," That's different now."
"19616160","19616340"," Sure."
"19616620","19617440"," Because we've had the broadening. "
"19617680","19623040"," And we've had broadening from big areas and big-name stocks, large market cap stocks that have hit"
"19623040","19625540"," new highs, and you're trading around those levels too."
"19625980","19630320"," That's helped us hang in if there needs to be an even bigger breather from some of these other"
"19630320","19630540"," things."
"19630540","19637340"," Of course, coming into the year, who had on their bingo card, I'm sorry, Tesla down, 20-something"
"19637340","19640960"," percent, Apple and Google down, and the broad market up, call it 8%. "
"19640960","19642580"," I mean, like literally nobody would have expected."
"19642660","19647420"," No, I wouldn't have expected that, but I do think one thing that I was handicapping, it wasn't that"
"19647420","19650160"," bold, but to say, it's not just going to be an either-or market."
"19650360","19653780"," It's not just going to be either MAG-7 or it's going to be Russell 2000. "
"19653780","19656440"," There was differentiation going on all over the place."
"19656640","19661660"," Those stocks you just mentioned, by the way Dan, are all the ones that have been carried by this"
"19661660","19662380"," momentum factor."
"19663080","19668980"," I think we have a chart of SPMO, it's the ETF for the S&P momentum stocks, and this decline"
"19668980","19672220"," today looks like nothing on a one-year chart. "
"19672440","19672740"," There it is."
"19673080","19680860"," But you see that just amazingly orderly ascent right there, and up 46% 12 months."
"19680860","19683660"," So all of that stuff gets flowed in there. "
"19683800","19689580"," So yeah, and the reason, Scott, a year ago, would have been different, is you didn't have a broad"
"19689580","19693320"," earnings upswing in the third quarter of earnings growth after a trough right now."
"19694160","19696000"," The Fed was peddled to the floor."
"19696000","19702700"," It's likely rounding into the moment where it's going to probably trim rates into an all-time high"
"19702700","19703580"," on the S&P 500. "
"19703960","19709160"," It's happened before, but it's kind of like a cherry on top, and the economy itself, of course, is"
"19709160","19709520"," doing fine."
"19709520","19714040"," Pascal Rello, Goldman Sachs, had an interesting note today, as he always does at the end of every"
"19714040","19714360"," week."
"19714600","19719200"," For those wondering about the sustainability of this rally, he says, it's been fair to ask what"
"19719200","19722780"," would happen if one or more of the magnificent seven stocks really came off the pace?"
"19723000","19724980"," Well, it's clearly happened, yet the..."
"19727900","19729620"," Sorry about that, I got to give you a second here. "
"19732500","19737160"," I just want to stop in with you before the end of the day today, at 4 p.m., and"
"19737160","19739960"," I'm going to expect that we come back down here."
"19740300","19741160"," I'm going to show you this."
"19741520","19748260"," At minimum, into the weekend into Monday at minimum, I'm going to be expecting more down to come. "
"19748940","19756120"," That trigger is holding up here on the hourly, so next target to the downside, 510 and 509,"
"19756780","19761700"," possibly even as low into next week as 505."
"19762480","19769680"," The percentages of tagging this next week are much lower, but at minimum, I would like to see at"
"19769680","19770360"," least this."
"19770620","19777120"," I would at least like to see right here into the close today, or possibly even into Monday, right"
"19777120","19778140"," down there, a nice tag. "
"19778620","19780900"," Let's do a 510 with a bounce to start."
"19781520","19785880"," So right there at the end of the day today, if we don't get this right now, if we continue"
"19785880","19791580"," to squeeze higher, we're going to be looking for that 510 on Monday, or if they drive it sideways"
"19791580","19792560"," or anything like that."
"19793100","19799340"," If they do get us down at 4 p.m., if they get us down here, on Monday, my expectations"
"19799340","19808120"," would be to come back up into right around this 512, and be looking for a squeeze higher after the"
"19808120","19812740"," open on Monday to retest the high above at 517. "
"19813380","19819400"," So let me just draw this up for you right now, and this will be more, depending on what happens,"
"19819400","19821040"," but something like this right here."
"19821660","19826500"," So there's four right in here."
"19826740","19827340"," This will be the close. "
"19827520","19828320"," Where's the close at?"
"19828360","19828800"," 1600?"
"19830300","19831220"," Where's 1600?"
"19833280","19834540"," Right about there."
"19835660","19836720"," Let me get this back."
"19838520","19839660"," Just on Monday. "
"19842140","19843980"," Something like that right there, okay?"
"19844460","19847840"," And then we'll be done for the day, and then Monday, I'm going to expect some kind of a rip"
"19847840","19853180"," on the Monday open, and then they like to sell Monday, the high on Monday, and then we'll come back"
"19853180","19854920"," down and look at the rest of the week next week."
"19855400","19859140"," If you are a member, I will have a full brief for you over the weekend."
"19859500","19863700"," Hopefully today, I'm dealing with some technical issues in the background, but I will have that"
"19863700","19864960"," posted for you on the website. "
"19865360","19866740"," I want you all to have a great weekend."
"19866900","19867660"," I will be in the Discord."
"19868220","19872960"," I am working all through the weekend, so if you want to hang out at any point, let me know,"
"19873160","19876120"," hang out in the Discord with me, say hi if you've got no life or anything like that. "
"19876220","19877560"," You'll kind of like me working your butt off."
"19877900","19879640"," I'll be there available for you."
"19880320","20280560"," Oh, they're"
"20280560","20281940"," really trying right now, right?"
"20287350","20290330"," Park this thing down here, blood this thing down. "
"20292610","20295730"," Right down there, that five, ten, right around there."
"20299280","20300500"," Right in there."
"20309890","20316310"," Company got overvalued, but we're, you know, could we talked about this last time?"
"20316550","20317630"," Couldn't NVIDIA get there?"
"20317970","20324790"," Yeah, but it would be at a much higher price to get to what Cisco's evaluation was in 2000 compared"
"20324790","20326050"," to what NVIDIA is now. "
"20326330","20332250"," Does it tell you, though, when you watch a stock like this go up seemingly every day, and it just"
"20332250","20336330"," reaches these heights that make you sit back and say, I just can't believe what this stock is"
"20336330","20336610"," doing."
"20336610","20342130"," Does it tell you that there's just too much froth in certain parts of the market, but not the whole"
"20342130","20342430"," thing?"
"20343750","20353150"," It tells me that we're beginning to get the trend followers and the momentum players, and they"
"20353150","20356630"," don't care what the valuation is, they don't care what the stock does, they don't care what the"
"20356630","20357350"," company does."
"20358190","20363770"," They got their charge, they say, wow, with this trend, make the trend your friend, and I'm making"
"20363770","20367670"," it my friend, and I got my stop there, I'm riding it up. "
"20369030","20371890"," You know, everyone's convinced that they can jump off."
"20372210","20378830"," The train before it goes off the cliff, and I'm not saying NVIDIA is at all ready to do that,"
"20379070","20386170"," but these are the games that speculators play, and I'm beginning to see more of those sort of"
"20386170","20396050"," players moved into the market, and, but it's extremely early stage, not late"
"20396050","20403930"," stage, because, you know, 25 years ago, you know, it had been gone on for many years before finally"
"20403930","20404350"," it crashed."
"20404810","20409890"," But you're painting a scenario, though, in which exuberance starts to get a little bit irrational"
"20409890","20413990"," and then turns into pure euphoria, and that's when you have to worry, but you don't think we're"
"20413990","20415530"," anywhere near that stage yet?"
"20416170","20417830"," Yeah, exactly, exactly. "
"20419950","20422450"," What did you make a pow on the hill this week?"
"20422750","20426090"," Who came off to many, maybe a little more dumb than expected?"
"20427210","20430390"," Yeah, a little bit dumb, I mean, he said that, and we're close."
"20431470","20432430"," I didn't expect that."
"20432570","20437910"," I mean, he could have shaded it, who, you know, I was, you know, we saw that January part of"
"20437910","20442370"," the World War, it immediately done a lot more work to go, but I think, you know, maybe got some"
"20442370","20449810"," inkling of, you know, a rather softish, good wage number that we're having now, and, you know,"
"20449950","20454150"," seeing some slowdown, saying, you know, we are very, very close. "
"20454510","20459950"," I think next Tuesday's number, CPI, and which, of course, is going to be the last one before the"
"20459950","20462590"," March 20th FOMC is going to be quite important."
"20463590","20468630"," I really like to see a reversal of that from the uptick that we had in January, and I think"
"20468630","20469990"," that that is definitely possible."
"20471110","20473110"," How many rate cuts are we getting this year, Professor?"
"20476190","20478290"," Well, you know, we talked about that. "
"20479390","20483950"," If we get too many, I'd worry, because that means the economy is crashing."
"20484510","20487710"," So, you know, you just say, oh, I just want as many as possible."
"20487870","20490610"," No, you don't want as many as possible. "
"20491030","20499430"," And, in fact, you know, as Mike said earlier, it's much more important for the economy to stay"
"20499430","20506930"," strong than for us to have, you know, a rate cut in May, or maybe June, or earlier later."
"20507490","20513230"," However, I mean, I think, you know, my feeling is that we're going to have rate cuts."
"20513610","20516410"," However, let me warn you, how many days is it going to be?"
"20516570","20524570"," March 20th, 12 days, I think we're going to have less rate cuts on the dot plot than we did"
"20524570","20531910"," in December, because I think, honestly, as we said officials are surprised and pleased, the"
"20531910","20536750"," strength of the economy, they say, you know, we don't have to cut that soon, you know, and I can"
"20536750","20539950"," afford to wait a little longer before I can squelch inflation. "
"20540630","20546170"," So, that might rattle the market a little bit, but, you know, it's only because of the strength of"
"20546170","20550470"," the economy, not because they're stubborn and won't do it beforehand."
"20550850","20557110"," In fact, Jay Powell says, I'm not waiting until all the inflation is rung out before, you know, I'm"
"20557110","20557670"," going to start cutting."
"20557670","20560410"," Which would obviously be late at that point. "
"20560690","20562550"," How far do you think the S&P can stretch?"
"20562850","20566670"," We call it, what do we, we're 51.30. We can call it now."
"20566970","20568270"," It seems reasonable to you."
"20570490","20573190"," Well, you know, we're 21 times forward earnings. "
"20573510","20577530"," Our earnings are holding in very well, and might actually come in a little bit higher."
"20577990","20579290"," That's a full valuation."
"20579790","20582270"," So, I may pay 5%, 10% over. "
"20584170","20587530"," Hey, can we get 50% over 60, 70?"
"20587810","20588230"," Absolutely."
"20589050","20592330"," Just like we can get 50% under at the bottom of the bear market."
"20593070","20599130"," You know, that is the emotion that has always swung markets over the decades, over the centuries. "
"20600990","20606710"," And, you know, it's the type of volatility that a long-term holder in stocks has to get used to,"
"20607170","20611390"," you know, to read the benefits of the long-term returns."
"20612450","20614750"," Let me ask you one more question before I let you run."
"20615190","20619470"," Have you been watching how Apple has been trading in the last, you know, several weeks?"
"20619670","20621410"," You have any concern about it?"
"20621950","20627570"," What do you make of it for a stock that we used to say as Apple goes, perhaps so goes"
"20627570","20629390"," the market, not so much today?"
"20631730","20636530"," Well, you know, I mean, I wanted to ask, you know, the first one maybe to topple. "
"20637190","20639590"," I'm not saying Apple is going to topple from the MAG-7."
"20639590","20642830"," I mean, but Tesla, you know, the competition."
"20643170","20648830"," Again, look, you know, I mean, what Tesla has gotten in China, which must have said, you know, this"
"20648830","20654050"," could be a problem besides all the other problems that EV has, and that's quite to what Tesla's, I"
"20654050","20656490"," don't know, down what, 50% from China Apple is still. "
"20657170","20662310"," I mean, this type of reaction from Apple, if it takes through history, certainly nothing unusual,"
"20662570","20664170"," and it still adds a great base."
"20664570","20672930"," But, you know, there is some competition, you know, take a look at the magnificent nine that"
"20672930","20676310"," reached their peak in 2000, how many of those are left?"
"20677090","20681030"," A few, but, you know, nothing stays at the top forever."
"20681850","20683130"," We'll make that the last word. "
"20683230","20683610"," Enjoy the weekend."
"20683810","20684270"," We'll see you soon."
"20684430","20685870"," Professor Jeremy Siegel, the Wharton School. "
"20686570","20689010"," You have a news alert to tell you about on Amazon."
"20689410","20692210"," Fortune is reporting that the FTC has begun probing."
"20693170","20695130"," Amazon's new fees on U.S. sellers. "
"20695390","20700170"," The sellers are reportedly not happy with those new fees, which require sellers to either pay"
"20700170","20705510"," Amazon, or begin shipping goods to at least four separate warehouses on their own dime, and another"
"20705510","20708950"," charge that punishes sellers for a consistently low inventory."
"20709330","20712710"," The FTC did not have any comment to CNBC about that story."
"20713110","20716890"," We've reached out, of course, to Amazon, and will update you with their response. "
"20717170","20720850"," If, in fact, we do get one, that's knocked down a little less than 1% on the session coming"
"20720850","20721070"," up."
"20721330","20723610"," We're going bargain hunting for under-the-radar opportunities."
"20724530","20729250"," With patient capital management, Christina Malbon, why she is buying stocks that have been left for"
"20729250","20729950"," dead in this market. "
"20730410","20731190"," We're back on the bell."
"20731490","20732290"," I'll have to just quick break."
"20739130","20949640"," We're not doing"
"20949640","20950100"," anything else. "
"20951740","20952860"," We are back in Nasdaq."
"20953000","20954840"," We're treating him with the broader chip sell-off today."
"20955100","20959600"," My next guest says she's finding opportunity in value names that have been left for dead in the"
"20959600","20960160"," current market. "
"20960560","20963640"," Joining me now, Christina Malbon of patient capital management."
"20964000","20964680"," Christina, welcome back."
"20964800","20965300"," It's nice to see you. "
"20965880","20967180"," Thanks so much for having me, Scott."
"20967640","20970960"," I get to these value plays in a minute, but as I look at the notes, the thing that honestly"
"20970960","20976400"," jumps out the most to me is that you say big tech, like Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon, are still being"
"20976400","20979640"," under-priced, under-priced by the market."
"20980480","20980880"," How so?"
"20982200","20984700"," Well, we think Google's a great example of this, right?"
"20984940","20988440"," So on the surface, you look at Google and you say it's treating at a market multiple. "
"20989220","20993280"," But if you actually start stripping out the businesses that are losing money or are under "
"20993280","20997380","-monetized, you're really paying a below-market multiple for the core of Google."
"20997380","21001600"," On top of that, we're at the very beginning of an AI trend."
"21002040","21006060"," And we know that Google has the most publications in AI research. "
"21006400","21011860"," And so they have put out an updated Gemini version that many are touting as as good, if not better,"
"21012260","21013040"," than chat GPT."
"21013700","21019140"," And we think longer-term, the AI trend is going to accrue to the cloud players."
"21019500","21021680"," And so we think Google is a very low position. "
"21022160","21027760"," And so that's what I mean when we say that they are under-priced, there's groups within the"
"21027760","21030580"," Magnificent Seven that are not pricing any for you yet."
"21030820","21031100"," Sure."
"21031240","21033160"," Part of them, you want to take Alphabet specifically. "
"21033420","21042220"," I mean, part of their rollout of some of their AI-related initiatives have been what some have"
"21042220","21043020"," termed an embarrassment."
"21043680","21049880"," I mean, even those, you know, close to the company have sort of panned what they've done thus far."
"21051260","21053120"," Yeah, so I agree with that, right?"
"21053120","21056400"," And we've had a ton of negative PR in relation to that. "
"21056920","21059200"," I think for us, we're long-term investors."
"21059740","21062980"," And so we hold things, you know, three, five, ten years."
"21063320","21069480"," And so this sort of negative PR blimp on the radar, we think will be long forgotten over a five "
"21069480","21070080","-year period. "
"21070540","21075480"," And we like to capitalize on those opportunities by adding to those positions or building a"
"21075480","21078100"," position when the market is negative on a story."
"21078720","21081880"," So for talking value names, what kinds of things should we be looking at?"
"21083000","21087740"," Yeah, so we like to think about value outside of the, you know, typical low price-to-book"
"21087740","21089320"," parameters."
"21089780","21094420"," We think nowadays that there's a lot of value in the market for companies that can sustain growth"
"21094420","21100240"," for longer than the market expects or that are under earning kind of like we highlighted with"
"21100240","21100480"," Google. "
"21100940","21103800"," And so, I mean, that we're really excited about is Canada Goose."
"21104700","21110920"," And you all might know Canada Goose as, you know, the luxury down jacket company."
"21110920","21116120"," But what I think is underappreciated is that they have been on an innovation front. "
"21116120","21118620"," They're expanding beyond heavyweight down."
"21118840","21121540"," They're moving into lightweight down and clothing."
"21122240","21127200"," And at the same time, they're expanding to a direct-to-consumer marketing, which is costing a lot"
"21127200","21128080"," of money to build up. "
"21128540","21130200"," So what we've seen is margins are compressed."
"21130760","21135580"," So if you're just screening for stocks, you're going to say, hey, this company is trading for 20"
"21135580","21136300"," times earnings."
"21136300","21142400"," But it's actually at a margin that's over half of what the core is actually earning. "
"21142860","21146900"," So if you actually look at what the core is earning, it's trading at 10 times."
"21147380","21153020"," And so we think that as they move forward and gain scale on the investments that they've made and"
"21153020","21157880"," as they go to cut costs, which they've announced a cost cutting program, that margins are actually"
"21157880","21161120"," going to build a lot faster than consensus has priced in."
"21161420","21162480"," And we see it as a bargain. "
"21163820","21165500"," What about royalty pharma?"
"21166400","21169300"," Why do you like that name, which is on your list in front of me?"
"21170040","21174740"," Yeah, so this is, once again, another name that I think you kind of need to dig into the details"
"21174740","21176580"," to really understand where it's trading."
"21177220","21181400"," And so this is a company that buys pharmaceutical royalties."
"21181960","21184700"," And they're the largest purchaser of royalties in the market. "
"21185200","21190280"," And it traded down over the last year as interest rates increase."
"21190280","21196000"," And the reason for that is they make low teens return on these royalty deals."
"21196360","21201280"," And so as interest rates went up, people became concerned about the spread between the return they"
"21201280","21204200"," were making and where they could borrow at. "
"21204800","21210340"," What we got confident in is that they're extremely disciplined and they actually manage the"
"21210340","21216080"," underwriting to maximize on the spread between their cost of capital and the return on these deals."
"21216920","21221340"," What's also a little bit tricky is that their gap accounting is completely off."
"21221600","21226960"," So when they buy a royalty, they make an estimate of what that royalty is worth. "
"21227760","21234200"," And then they account for it in gap at the current valuation, but they have to adjust it up or"
"21234200","21236560"," down based on changes and assumptions."
"21236920","21242040"," So the gap number just really isn't reflective of what they're taking home and cash at the end of"
"21242040","21242380"," the day."
"21242380","21247020"," And if you look at what they're taking home and cash, this is a firm trading at eight times. "
"21247620","21252460"," That is deploying capital in a market where we see capital pull back from biotechs."
"21252680","21259620"," So we saw last year there was almost no new capital going to these young companies with innovative"
"21259620","21260060"," products."
"21260060","21265840"," And that really lends itself to royalty farmer being able to buy these quality royalty assets when"
"21265840","21266780"," no one else is available. "
"21266780","21273440"," Furthermore, you see cash strapped legacy players like Teva do deals with them when they want to"
"21273440","21278140"," monetize assets in their pipeline that they can't prioritize given the debt that they have to focus"
"21278140","21278820"," on repaying."
"21279800","21280660"," Christina, thank you."
"21280720","21281180"," We'll see you soon. "
"21282620","21285440"," Up next, we're tracking the biggest movers as we head into the close."

"21812020","21815760"," Coming up next, Costco shares tumbling after reporting quarterly results. "
"21816420","21819100"," Well, Apple looks to end a seven day losing streak."
"21819300","21820160"," Those stories are much more."
"21820540","21821840"," We'll take inside the market zone next. "
"22031110","22033170"," Time for the closing bell market zone."
"22033610","22038130"," CNBC senior markets commentator Mike Sant's only here to break down the crucial moments of this"
"22038130","22038670"," trading day."
"22038670","22042250"," But Steve, go back on Apple heading for his first positive session. "
"22042490","22045390"," Believe it or not, an eight and Courtney Reagan on the sell off."
"22045590","22049130"," And Costco shares might go off beginning with you as we close out another week."
"22049250","22050710"," Your biggest takeaways are what?"
"22050910","22055950"," All those things can be wrapped together into the is the momentum on trade or is it off. "
"22055950","22058030"," And so today you had a little upset in that."
"22058250","22060310"," It's about a 50 50 up down day."
"22060310","22061750"," It's actually pretty orderly. "
"22062130","22066890"," And I think you can take away from that the idea that the jobs number today, the Powell testimony"
"22066890","22072510"," this week, even the other data which show moderate growth dynamics are giving people a little bit"
"22072510","22073650"," of a psychological cushion."
"22074150","22079190"," That says even if the market needs to kind of have a period of turbulence, if this momentum trade"
"22079190","22085130"," unwinds further, it's not because the macro has fallen apart or financial conditions are getting"
"22085130","22085450"," hostile."
"22086030","22087670"," And video loses a hundred bucks. "
"22087950","22090830"," It's worth about half of the half percent decline in the S&P."
"22090910","22092950"," What an amazing day it's been for those shares."
"22092950","22097930"," And finally Steve Kovac, Apple, above 170, above 171 actually. "
"22098250","22099510"," It's going to end that streak."
"22100250","22104510"," Yeah, maybe the nightmare is over, but it's been nightmarish headlines, just all weeks got for"
"22104510","22104730"," Apple."
"22104950","22111450"," I mean, we had the report earlier this week that sales of the iPhone are down 24% in China"
"22111450","22113370"," for the first six weeks of the year. "
"22113790","22119070"," On top of that, just those lingering questions about AI, just this morning city cutting its price"
"22119070","22121290"," target from 225 to 220."
"22121970","22126130"," The list just goes on and on and on, not to mention the regulatory pressure."
"22126250","22129930"," Apple is already feeling in the EU with the digital markets act. "
"22130090","22135150"," They were kind of humbled today and actually had to reinstate the developer account for Epic Games,"
"22135350","22139530"," the Fortnite maker they've been beefing with legally for the last three and a half, four years now."
"22139670","22146190"," So look, there's just a lot going on right here, but the concerns remain about where Apple fits"
"22146190","22153190"," into the AI narrative and how it can recover in China, if it can recover at all, especially with"
"22153190","22155470"," that renewed competition from Huawei Scott."
"22156050","22156990"," Appreciate that very much. "
"22156990","22158550"," Steve Kovac, thank you to Courtney Reagan."
"22158890","22161390"," Nice run for Costco shares until today."
"22161750","22164910"," Yeah, you know, Costco shares under pressure after reporting second quarter results. "
"22165250","22169970"," Earnings did exceed expectations, comparable sales 5.6%. It was also better than consensus and it"
"22169970","22170790"," was driven by traffic."
"22171390","22175530"," But revenue net sales, yeah, they slightly missed annual assessments, but still analysts like the"
"22175530","22180470"," margin expansion, membership numbers, along with that traffic driven comparable sales number."
"22180690","22184510"," Plus, there's some big ticket items that had been under pressure and those sell sales improvements,"
"22184670","22185790"," things like appliances. "
"22186410","22190450"," And while Costco is a consumer staple, you point out, Scott, it's had a really decent rally ahead"
"22190450","22192590"," of the print of 20% in three months."
"22192590","22197490"," That's actually including today's downward pressure and well ahead of the other major indexes."
"22197950","22201970"," Profit taking, of course, could be some of the reason for the low removal on shares today. "
"22202290","22204510"," So I think it's important to keep all that in perspective too."
"22204710","22205150"," Back over to you."
"22205290","22205770"," We will. "
"22205990","22206430"," Thank you."
"22207010","22207470"," Courtney Reagan."
"22207790","22207950"," All right. "
"22208070","22208490"," Mike, thanks, Julia."
"22208590","22209130"," I'll turn back to you."
"22209210","22209890"," You heard the sound effect. "
"22210190","22211210"," We're approaching a minute left."
"22211790","22211910"," All right."
"22212030","22212210"," CPI. "
"22212650","22212790"," Yeah."
"22213150","22217510"," So we're going to learn early next week whether January was a blip or the start of something more"
"22217510","22217830"," worrisome."
"22218470","22220210"," Right now, it feels like it was probably a blip. "
"22220350","22221430"," But you just never know to get that."
"22221510","22221730"," Yeah."
"22221950","22226470"," The stuff we got this week implied that January seasonals maybe looked like they were running a"
"22226470","22227510"," little hotter than expected. "
"22227510","22233870"," We also perhaps are at a point where we can start to explain away part of any upside surprise"
"22233870","22235690"," because we know it's going to happen with shelter."
"22236270","22241810"," And we also know the Fed's orientation is not to look for excuses to sort of take away the rate"
"22241810","22243190"," code expectations at this point."
"22243370","22249690"," So, you know, with any luck, it kind of ends up being right in line with the trend, which is,"
"22249970","22253350"," I would say, stubborn disinflation still in train. "
"22254030","22254650"," Probably the market's okay."
"22254650","22257290"," The ball market's already had a big move globally yields down."
"22257610","22258170"," You know, the low. "
"22258250","22258390"," All right."
"22258470","22260390"," I'll see all of you on Monday, baby."
"22260610","22262010"," Nine o'clock in the morning. "
"22262250","22262670"," It's way."
"22263070","22267830"," It's allowed the stock market to get preoccupied with its own little stories and chasing with that"
"22267830","22269590"," blood right into the bell."
"22269970","22270250"," Whoo. "
"22271030","22272010"," Sell it down."
"22272010","22274590"," On the end of the day, it certainly doesn't look like the beginning."
"22274790","22275390"," What a day it's been. "
"22275790","22277470"," I think they keep selling here, too."
"22277590","22283010"," I think it keeps going right down into that 14 right right down into that 15 minute market for 15."
"22284290","22284870"," Hey, you guys. "
"22284970","22285470"," Have a great weekend."
"22285630","22287390"," I'll see all of you on Monday morning."
"22287890","22288850"," Nine a.m., baby. "
"22289030","22290070"," I'll catch you in Sunday Discord. "
