"iCFUkCibyhc","0","8960"," The greatest feeling you can get in a gym or the most satisfying feeling you can get"
"iCFUkCibyhc","8960","12360"," in a gym is the pump."
"iCFUkCibyhc","12360","19360"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here with your daily brief."
"iCFUkCibyhc","19360","27560"," I live in a state where we had a storm over this past week on Wednesday and we lost power."
"iCFUkCibyhc","27560","31400"," We should have power off for up to 10 days in parts of the state."
"iCFUkCibyhc","31400","35760"," I think that the electrical infrastructure here is antiquated at best."
"iCFUkCibyhc","35760","37560"," I'll leave it there."
"iCFUkCibyhc","37560","43120"," I'm not from this state, but to not bury power lines is to me unconscionable, especially"
"iCFUkCibyhc","43120","47600"," if you head out west, any of the western states, all power lines are buried."
"iCFUkCibyhc","47600","50720"," Well, not all of them, not all of the western states, but most of them."
"iCFUkCibyhc","50720","56840"," So when they tell you that it's too costly to do, that's complete matter of fucking bullshit."
"iCFUkCibyhc","56840","60400"," And the cost for electricity in the state is very high."
"iCFUkCibyhc","60400","64560"," So I'm not going to name the company or which state only to, because I don't want to get"
"iCFUkCibyhc","64560","66320"," sued, but whatever."
"iCFUkCibyhc","66320","78200"," So I did plot out and chart the S&P or not the S&P 500E MIDI going to, well, let's roll"
"iCFUkCibyhc","78200","79360"," back a little bit."
"iCFUkCibyhc","79360","89240"," Goldman Sachs gave a price target of 470, which for end of year, which to me was more"
"iCFUkCibyhc","89240","93640"," than I was expecting, or at least more than I was targeting for end of year."
"iCFUkCibyhc","93640","96560"," I thought that was a very liberal estimate."
"iCFUkCibyhc","96560","100560"," And then someone else put, I don't forget who the other person was, or the other group"
"iCFUkCibyhc","100560","106200"," was, but someone else put a price target of 5,000 by end of year, and then that kind"
"iCFUkCibyhc","106200","107600"," of blew my face off."
"iCFUkCibyhc","107600","113520"," So I did chart out where that 5,000 move comes from, and where that 4,700 move comes"
"iCFUkCibyhc","113520","124960"," from friend of year, and that's somewhere, here's that 5,000 move right there."
"iCFUkCibyhc","124960","131160"," So this is that 5,000 move that everyone's talking about, or Purnables are talking about"
"iCFUkCibyhc","131160","136200"," somewhere up in here, that's 4,983, and that's what they're saying, that we're going to create"
"iCFUkCibyhc","136200","141080"," a new trading channel or trade above for the rest of the year."
"iCFUkCibyhc","141080","147520"," The GS, Goldman Sachs is actually looking very reasonable to say that we get to 4,700,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","147520","153200"," so there's 4,699.5, and this is November."
"iCFUkCibyhc","153200","157720"," Now that would, now the Goldman Sachs estimate actually looks a little bit more reasonable."
"iCFUkCibyhc","157720","162000"," It looks more attainable if we do have any pullbacks in here, let's say we swing back"
"iCFUkCibyhc","162080","166720"," down, and then we trade up and grind up the last end of December."
"iCFUkCibyhc","166720","171560"," I think we did that last year, I think we ground up, I think most holidays, we've become"
"iCFUkCibyhc","171560","175720"," a low volume environment, and we do this slow grind that last month."
"iCFUkCibyhc","175720","181320"," You can kind of just set some call spreads, let's say some, at some point in November,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","181320","186360"," December, and you just let them ride all the way into the holiday season."
"iCFUkCibyhc","186360","191760"," And this does make sense for me right here, but I can still see what the Purnables are"
"iCFUkCibyhc","191760","196800"," saying as well, saying that we'll have S&P 5000 by end of year."
"iCFUkCibyhc","196800","201440"," This does not bode well for the bears, if you're a bear, you don't want to be seeing"
"iCFUkCibyhc","201440","202440"," this."
"iCFUkCibyhc","202440","209440"," Now, we can go to a smaller timeframe here, what I'm calling for over the weekend is a"
"iCFUkCibyhc","209440","217080"," move up to test an attempt to trade in an upper trading channel on the E-mini and spy."
"iCFUkCibyhc","217080","224880"," So let's call, let's, I'm going to make a call from Friday into Monday for an attempt"
"iCFUkCibyhc","224880","233160"," to get above 4467.75, and with an attempt to try to hold that into Monday."
"iCFUkCibyhc","233160","238200"," Now the thing you need to understand about this move up here, let me see if I can draw"
"iCFUkCibyhc","238200","243000"," this out for you, is, you know, the attempt is going to be that we come up here, swing"
"iCFUkCibyhc","243000","251720"," up an attempt to land somewhere above this, this 4476 or 4472."
"iCFUkCibyhc","251720","259160"," Now if this does not hold, we are coming down quite far, that's an issue, because if we"
"iCFUkCibyhc","259160","269240"," don't hold this line up here, you're talking about a move back down to 4429.75, a retest"
"iCFUkCibyhc","269240","270240"," down here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","270240","275640"," So there's a lot of expansion of trading range in this area that we're going to encounter"
"iCFUkCibyhc","275640","283440"," in the coming few weeks, you will see this trading area expand, and you'll see bulls"
"iCFUkCibyhc","283440","291640"," try to push up in here, and you'll see the bears trying to retest these levels and get"
"iCFUkCibyhc","291640","294600"," the bulls to take some profit off the table."
"iCFUkCibyhc","294600","300920"," We'll come on in a closer time frame, and you'll kind of see how big this move actually"
"iCFUkCibyhc","300920","301920"," would be."
"iCFUkCibyhc","301920","305840"," It's a pretty substantial move right here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","305840","310640"," So I am still calling for this move to take place, this extension, so we're going to come"
"iCFUkCibyhc","310640","313920"," up, we're going to make this run up here from now until Monday."
"iCFUkCibyhc","313920","322120"," On the downside risk is much greater than the upside risk, so I would be conscious of"
"iCFUkCibyhc","322120","325240"," that as we move forward into Monday."
"iCFUkCibyhc","325240","330680"," If this move does not hold, you're going to look for your first price target at 4453,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","330680","336640"," and then no less than 4429.75."
"iCFUkCibyhc","336640","342920"," Now seasonality wise, as we get closer to OPEC's on the 21st, and as we move into the"
"iCFUkCibyhc","342920","348200"," month of September, the risk just keeps piling on and piling on."
"iCFUkCibyhc","348200","353480"," So maybe the bulls try to drive it up here from now until the end of August, so that"
"iCFUkCibyhc","353480","359240"," they fall down, or there's enough expansion here for a decent pullback, bears get to make"
"iCFUkCibyhc","359240","366680"," their money, and we continue to make that move up into the 4700 or 5000 mark."
"iCFUkCibyhc","366680","369800"," This is not good news for the bears overall."
"iCFUkCibyhc","369800","375680"," Now if you are a bull, this is great news, but though it is great news, you're talking"
"iCFUkCibyhc","375680","381760"," about now about range expansion and volatility entering the picture, at least up in this"
"iCFUkCibyhc","381760","384680"," area here, and high danger."
"iCFUkCibyhc","384680","389760"," You don't want to be buying this, and you don't want to be in this move, maybe possibly"
"iCFUkCibyhc","389760","397920"," with day trades, but in reality, you want to be buying any of these retests down here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","397920","400720"," This is where the dip buy gang comes in."
"iCFUkCibyhc","400720","404080"," This is all risk right now up in this area here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","404080","410480"," So I probably will attempt to play, if we can get any kind of a pullback this afternoon"
"iCFUkCibyhc","410480","415200"," or this morning, or if we just start making this move up from now until Monday, I might"
"iCFUkCibyhc","415200","422440"," play this, although I am holding some put debit spreads out into late August for OPEX."
"iCFUkCibyhc","422440","427440"," I got them tagged for the 23rd, trying to catch any drop that might happen down here"
"iCFUkCibyhc","427440","435120"," any retests, I might still, holding those put spreads, play this next move up."
"iCFUkCibyhc","435120","441520"," I'm also playing some UVXY calls, I think I got the ones of some FDs that are expiring"
"iCFUkCibyhc","441520","446360"," today, but I'll just keep adding those on from now until the end of August."
"iCFUkCibyhc","446360","452920"," I'm assuming that with this range expansion, we're also going to get some volatility mixed"
"iCFUkCibyhc","452920","454400"," in here as well."
"iCFUkCibyhc","454960","460520"," If we do retest down here, the fair is going to increase as we move up into this trading"
"iCFUkCibyhc","460520","461520"," channel."
"iCFUkCibyhc","461520","466360"," You'll see a fair increase, they will have a tendency to panic sell."
"iCFUkCibyhc","466360","472400"," So that's where you'll see that, that UVXY start to expand and start to spike, if not,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","472400","479080"," even if we keep moving up, and I'm also going to be playing daily full FDs, and I'm also"
"iCFUkCibyhc","479080","484600"," looking for some retests down below as the month progresses."
"iCFUkCibyhc","484600","489680"," So my call for the over the weekend from now until Monday is going to be a push to 44,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","489680","495760"," 67.75, hope that the bulls can hold it, and have some insurance as we make these moves"
"iCFUkCibyhc","495760","496760"," up."
"iCFUkCibyhc","496760","498320"," Moving on to NQ."
"iCFUkCibyhc","498320","504560"," So we have some healthy pullbacks on NQ, and even as we make this move down over here,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","504560","510320"," you can see we're still reclaiming this trading channel here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","510320","515240"," You should be buying all these dips or selling all these moves, these rips up."
"iCFUkCibyhc","515240","521280"," One thing that needs to be said is that on intermediate models, even NASDAQ is not looking"
"iCFUkCibyhc","521280","522280"," too rough."
"iCFUkCibyhc","522280","527000"," You're going to be looking for NASDAQ to make a challenge over the weekend."
"iCFUkCibyhc","527000","533880"," You're going to look for NASDAQ to hit 15, 1, 2, 2, and possibly attempt to challenge"
"iCFUkCibyhc","533880","537440"," this 15, 1, 7, 2, 0.25."
"iCFUkCibyhc","537440","543000"," Now as we make this move up from now until Monday, it's going to attempt to hold, and"
"iCFUkCibyhc","543000","549240"," that would support that, that theory that SPY is going, or the S&P ES is going to make"
"iCFUkCibyhc","549240","551920"," this next move up."
"iCFUkCibyhc","551920","558280"," Now if NQ does not hold and wants to retest down here, we already know that we have major"
"iCFUkCibyhc","558280","561800"," supports along this line here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","561800","570520"," So I'm calling for NQ to make a move up to 15, 167 by Monday."
"iCFUkCibyhc","570520","577680"," And if it does not hold, this number here of 15, 0, 8, 3, I'm looking for a major retest"
"iCFUkCibyhc","577680","580880"," down below at 15,012."
"iCFUkCibyhc","580880","589520"," IWM, IWM is still respecting its trading channel, let me scale this out slightly for"
"iCFUkCibyhc","589520","592600"," you so you can take a look."
"iCFUkCibyhc","592600","596600"," You should be buying any of these dips that we're getting down here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","596600","600760"," You'll also notice this was on August 4th, we're going to go on a smaller time frame"
"iCFUkCibyhc","600760","602320"," of over here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","602320","609600"," Now what you want to be looking at is any of these dips are currently being bought, though"
"iCFUkCibyhc","609600","616240"," the time to be buying dips in the IWM is when they come back down to retest this 217 level,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","616240","619080"," let's say for right now, 218."
"iCFUkCibyhc","619080","621760"," This is really where you want to be starting your longs."
"iCFUkCibyhc","621760","627320"," Now we'll get a little bit closer here and we're going to see this new channel here."
"iCFUkCibyhc","627320","633960"," This is on the 27th, this right here is on August 4th and we really haven't traded down"
"iCFUkCibyhc","633960","635720"," below here this past week."
"iCFUkCibyhc","635720","642720"," I'm a little bit more bearish right now on IWM, I'm going to give a call for today."
"iCFUkCibyhc","642720","651480"," From Friday into Monday we're going to attempt to retest 220, 62 and possibly even 217.94"
"iCFUkCibyhc","651480","652800"," in small caps."
"iCFUkCibyhc","652800","658440"," I think that small caps are going to turn out but this trading range is very tight for"
"iCFUkCibyhc","658440","659600"," this week."
"iCFUkCibyhc","659600","665200"," Now if we do decide that we're going to make a move up, you could call this consolidation"
"iCFUkCibyhc","665200","672560"," area here for this week or we do have a predicted trading range for IWM, so you're going to"
"iCFUkCibyhc","672560","676400"," be looking to buy this dip down here at 220.56."
"iCFUkCibyhc","676400","683520"," If we do get that move up you want to look for a move that holds above 224.7.4."
"iCFUkCibyhc","683520","687920"," You could play this, this is possible to play today but I would be looking for some sort"
"iCFUkCibyhc","687920","690920"," of a dip buying opportunity as well."
"iCFUkCibyhc","690920","695240"," If you're already long you could stay long here and wait and hope that we get this jump"
"iCFUkCibyhc","695240","699400"," above but I do think that we need more expansion on this range."
"iCFUkCibyhc","699400","707920"," We will see down here that we really do want to be seeing something more like this."
"iCFUkCibyhc","707920","713760"," This will get us to where we really need to be which is above, let's call it like that."
"iCFUkCibyhc","713760","720520"," You do want to see some form of a touch here, a push back down here, a jump above here or"
"iCFUkCibyhc","720520","725240"," even a move down this deep for one more slingshot way above."
"iCFUkCibyhc","725240","729800"," Look at this expanding megaphone I think to call on this these days, look for this"
"iCFUkCibyhc","729800","735600"," to expand some more expansion in the trading range and then a larger move up over time."
"iCFUkCibyhc","735600","740600"," This might put you into late August here, so I wouldn't be going long here, I wouldn't"
"iCFUkCibyhc","740600","745360"," be going short, I would expect longs to make it above, retest here if they can't claim"
"iCFUkCibyhc","745360","752040"," above and expect another move down in the coming week."
"iCFUkCibyhc","752040","756360"," Everyone wants to know about Tesla, right?"
"iCFUkCibyhc","756360","763000"," We talked earlier in the week about Tesla and where it wants to go."
"iCFUkCibyhc","763000","769960"," We all know that we're buying these any dips down below here at 697.70."
"iCFUkCibyhc","769960","777240"," We know that we go full on and down below to 652 and 676, anywhere down in here we're"
"iCFUkCibyhc","777240","781160"," going all in, anything here we're starting our longs, right?"
"iCFUkCibyhc","781160","786680"," I think the last video I spoke about this and you had a perfect opportunity into the"
"iCFUkCibyhc","786680","792000"," close on Friday I believe and then you had another opportunity later in the week to buy"
"iCFUkCibyhc","792000","793000"," these dips."
"iCFUkCibyhc","793000","798440"," I think even in my last video we talked about this and you can see right down below here"
"iCFUkCibyhc","798440","805080"," 699.98, I mean you should be buying these at every chance that you have, so I don't"
"iCFUkCibyhc","805080","808160"," know what else to say about being bullish on Tesla at this point."
"iCFUkCibyhc","808160","812400"," If you're not bullish on Tesla, you're doing something wrong."
"iCFUkCibyhc","812400","814880"," Now we do have some other issues."
"iCFUkCibyhc","814880","820720"," There are people that probably don't want to see us continue to trade up here and you"
"iCFUkCibyhc","820720","825280"," see that upper resistance at 727.24."
"iCFUkCibyhc","825280","830560"," We made this push up here, this is just this week, 1, 2, 3, and 4."
"iCFUkCibyhc","830560","836520"," I do think that we might attempt to jump above."
"iCFUkCibyhc","836520","844000"," So from today, Friday into Monday, I'm going to get, I'm going to make a call from today"
"iCFUkCibyhc","844000","848880"," and from now until the end of the close on Monday you're going to see I move up to this"
"iCFUkCibyhc","848880","851480"," 749 or 750."
"iCFUkCibyhc","851480","858160"," They might let options expire today, so let's say we do a slight pullback down below today,"
"iCFUkCibyhc","858160","862120"," maybe down to 710.09."
"iCFUkCibyhc","862120","871960"," Then next week we make this move up into the 728.16 level, we'll attempt to jump above"
"iCFUkCibyhc","871960","875920"," here and then make a move up to 750 in the coming week."
"iCFUkCibyhc","875920","882720"," So I am bullish on Tesla, I would say today look for some pullback or even a push up to"
"iCFUkCibyhc","882720","890680"," attempt to hold this 727.69 over the weekend for a run up to 750 following next week."
"iCFUkCibyhc","890680","894960"," So that's all I've got for you guys this morning, I'm going to keep these broadcasts"
"iCFUkCibyhc","894960","899720"," kind of short over the coming days until we have the electricity turned back on."
"iCFUkCibyhc","899720","903840"," I have to do a bunch of maintenance around the house, I have to make sure that my home"
"iCFUkCibyhc","903840","908240"," is secure, I got to make sure that my neighbors are doing well, and then I got to do maintenance"
"iCFUkCibyhc","908320","914480"," on some generators that I've got up and running, make sure my wife and my kids are all safe"
"iCFUkCibyhc","914480","919680"," and happy and the general things that can put people at ease, I have to take care of."
"iCFUkCibyhc","919680","925520"," So I look forward to talking to you all on Twitter this week and over the weekend and"
"iCFUkCibyhc","925520","927640"," I'll see you out on the trading floor today."
