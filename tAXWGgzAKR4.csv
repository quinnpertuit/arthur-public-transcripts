"1367860","1375180"," I mean again the the most growth in terms of some space without a doubt By far the largest of"
"1375180","1382500"," them but The even guy has given a couple of people pause because it was a bit broader than typical"
"1382500","1388980"," or wider Some of that may go back to this program Called the Affordable Connectivity program the"
"1388980","1391460"," news a bit lately because it's going to expire."

"2929690","2935570"," March is still kind of a toss-up around 50% odds, but the odds increase that they'll do something"
"2935570","2941870"," now I think the debate is what is the destination on Race, you know, are we gonna get all the"

"2957490","2958510"," that's going to be a discussion."
"2958770","2963630"," I think at the Fed which is okay inflation is letting us cut rates now Where are we going?"

"2974490","2974870"," landing. "
"2975170","2980990"," We're gonna get away with this with lower inflation Last mile is gonna be okay But then there's the"
"2980990","2982390"," question of why does everyone feel so miserable?"
"2982390","2987570"," So here she says lately the inflation is now near near term at close to the lowest levels We've"
"2987570","2990950"," seen in this survey and she's talking about the University of Michigan survey That's what she looks"
"2990950","2996670"," at for sentiment So I think Americans do believe inflation is under control And I'm not sure"
"2996670","3002290"," Americans do because if you continue to listen to the to the polls or the political commentators or"
"3002290","3008130"," talk to ordinary Americans they They don't feel it Which is just an interesting dynamic going into"
"3008130","3012870"," election where the economy has been good and strong and so is the job market And so it was wage"
"3012870","3017990"," growth and inflation comes all the way back down and it and it just doesn't feel that way prices"
"3017990","3024310"," moved up so far In a relatively short amount of time that it just the period of adjustment is"
"3024310","3031110"," probably longer so you feel like okay And still higher from where we were a few years ago Which I"
"3031110","3036790"," think people feel as well and as as the excess savings kind of run out that dynamic, you know The"
"3036790","3037710"," savings rate was down."
"3037970","3043770"," I think 3.7% on today's number as well so that that's still play and then the other thing"
"3043770","3049370"," guys is we've had all these corporate results and The outlooks from corporate America have kind of"
"3049370","3060790"," been mixed some very strong some a little more cautious Here's the visa CFO for instance Consumer"
"3060790","3066890"," spend across all segments low to high spend has remained relatively stable Our data does not"
"3066890","3073190"," indicate any meaningful behavior change across consumer segments Good read there, and then the Levi"
"3073190","3082170"," CFO sounded a little more cautious Momentum entering 2024 we're taking a conservative approach to"
"3082170","3087970"," our outlook for the foliar Primarily reflecting of cautious view on the macro environment,"
"3088490","3094650"," especially in the US and Europe Cautious view here's one from capital one because you know we've"
"3094650","3099790"," all been watching these delinquency rates on domestic credit according to the CEO We believe that"
"3099790","3104710"," normalization has run its course and credit results have stabilized the 30 plus delinquency rate"
"3104710","3109970"," has been stable on a seasonally adjusted basis for a number of months now Monthly auto credit began"
"3109970","3114190"," to stabilize even earlier than domestic credit card results on a monthly basis auto delinquency"
"3114190","3119110"," rate and charge off rates Have been tracking normal seasonal patterns since the first half of 2023"
"3119110","3123070"," and continuing to do so in December So that might make you feel a little bit better about the"
"3123070","3129270"," delinquency rates Although I would just note that it's it's very mixed to get commentary even from"
"3129270","3131650"," consumer names like a Levi's Versus a visa."
"3132190","3137050"," I don't think the visibility is very strong in terms of Whether the economy's cooling and how much"
"3137050","3141170"," and I think it just depends again on the income segments and on the categories as we've been"
"3141170","3146410"," talking about Throughout this recovery Yeah, we've mentioned in the nine That's almost a two-year"
"3146410","3151190"," high on capital one which has been a name that has been at the center of the discussion about the"

"3171750","3177270"," is kind of around that and the question is is it normalizing or is it deteriorating and that is"
"3177270","3180750"," going to be something that We and the Fed is probably going to discuss next week is going to be"
"3180750","3186410"," crazy because we get the Fed meeting the jobs number the jolt's number We'll learn a lot more about"

"3632030","3635830"," You know what we want to lower deal We'll we'll stick with this on appeal But we want a lower"
"3635830","3640510"," deal or if they just walk away from it all together because at the end appeal david Most believe"
"3640510","3641410"," it's four to five months. "
"3641710","3644990"," You want to go through this for four to five months and you think you're going to have a different"

"4740170","4744870"," sense is that we'll probably uh push comes to shove weight a little longer just make absolutely"
"4744870","4750990"," sure inflation is At target or headed to target before they make that move but uh, you know, we're"
"4750990","4754110"," we're here Uh, and you're right very surprising."
"4754270","4755390"," I mean even for me."
"4755570","4761050"," I didn't expect we'd be at 2 percent I mean in fact if you look at core consumer expenditure The"
"4761050","4763110"," player inflation over the past six months. "
"4763110","4765690"," It's less than 2 percent on an annualized basis."
"4765910","4767890"," So well, we're here We're here."
"4768070","4770470"," How do they I mean Will it last?"
"4771090","4776950"," Is I mean, it's it's hard to believe that they that they managed to get the soft landing That they"
"4776950","4783330"," that they wanted but I don't know too much of a good thing Yeah, I I think I think we're"
"4783330","4788250"," yeah, I mean, it's it's always going to be a struggle, uh, but I I think You know, there's good"
"4788250","4793670"," reason to believe that uh inflation has come back in inflation expectations are well tethered and"
"4793670","4799490"," anchored wage growth is moderating Consistent with uh productivity growth, you know, all the things"
"4799490","4805310"," that one would look at to gauge whether You know inflation is going to remain stable and low or in"
"4805310","4805630"," place. "
"4805750","4811090"," So I think we can stay with some confidence, but you know things happen I one thing I do worry"
"4811090","4816490"," about is oil prices Uh, very hard to forecast where they're going a lot of cross-currents there in"
"4816490","4821970"," global markets and given all the geopolitical threats So if oil prices go back up, I could scramble"
"4821970","4827230"," things at least for a while But you know barring something unforeseen it just feels like you know"
"4827230","4832550"," inflation is back in the bottle Is it back in the bottle though for ordinary americans because you"
"4832550","4837650"," know, I talk about all this progress all the time and how Secretary yelling is very thrilled with"
"4837650","4843990"," these results and president biden should be very happy and then everyone says You don't know what"
"4843990","4848990"," it feels like we're still paying much higher prices than where we were several years ago We're"
"4848990","4850090"," still not at the point."
"4850390","4856470"," We're all the way back down It just people still are feeling the effects of high inflation and"
"4856470","4861870"," they're pointing their finger at the administration for feeling it well, uh exit you're right."
"4862170","4867850"," I mean the inflation the rate of growth has slowed back to the reserve's target, but the level of"
"4867850","4873670"," prices is obviously a lot higher than it was two three years ago It feels like for the staples. "
"4874110","4879950"," I think food is uh is uh kind of at the top of the list of of pain points for"
"4879950","4884730"," for many americans particularly lower middle-income americans Uh rent is also a lot higher."
"4884990","4888910"," I mean rents have gone flat to down over the last year or so But they're still way way above"
"4888910","4894170"," where they were a couple three years ago Uh in energy also to some degree So, you know the the"
"4894170","4899530"," staples that people need the prices are a lot higher for those things So I get I get it and"
"4899530","4906510"," I you know, there's a lot of financial pain good news though is that People's wages across the wage"
"4906510","4910950"," distribution high wage workers low wage workers Their wages are now rising much faster than the"
"4910950","4915730"," rate of inflation So with these passing month that that financial sting that people are feeling"
"4915730","4922250"," should feel less painful going forward And you know, I think six months from now a year from now"
"4922250","4927190"," You know people won't be as concerned about inflation as they were Now just really quickly to your"
"4927190","4929190"," point about explaining the administration."
"4929790","4935850"," I don't think that's fair I mean, I do think early on when we got the fiscal support that did"
"4935850","4940470"," support the juice up inflation But that was hard to remember back then but back then that was"
"4940470","4944730"," desirable inflation We would have been in through a period of a decade or more of sub optimal"
"4944730","4945410"," inflation here. "
"4945590","4951150"," We were we got the inflation We were all hoping for Uh, but you know since the last year two"
"4951150","4955210"," or three It's more about the pandemic and russian war has nothing to really do with the fiscal"
"4955210","4958610"," policy Uh, mark, I'll end on geopolitics."
"4959010","4964210"," So we report obviously every day on new attacks in the red sea Thankfully not coming too much, but"
"4964210","4970390"," diverting a lot of traffic Uh price of oils that are recent high Any thoughts there in terms of"
"4970390","4976630"," what that could mean overall for for economic growth if it continues to fester Yeah, well lots of"
"4976630","4982190"," scenarios But the most likely scenario is that while disruptive it's not it's not going to get to a"
"4982190","4986710"," place where you know Things completely shut down the trade doesn't completely get disrupted here"
"4987250","4990530"," And if that's the case if what we're seeing now is what we're seeing we're going to see going"
"4990530","4996930"," forward here It's an irritant it adds to goods inflation, but it's really on the margin I mean, you"
"4996930","5001990"," know at the end of the day Goods prices are only 20 25 of the consumer basket So if you"
"5001990","5006290"," kind of do a little bit of arithmetic, it's it's no big deal Not having said that obviously you can"
"5006290","5010750"," construct darker scenarios and if the trade gets completely shut down That would be a bigger deal,"
"5010750","5016310"," but uh, you know, I don't think that's the most likely scenario Mark sandy good to check in with"
"5016310","5017810"," you on this fresh batch of data."
"5018230","5023850"," Thank you for joining us Take care Mark sandy from moody's analytics still to come tesla's post"
"5023850","5029150"," earnings plunge are racing more than 80 billion dollars in market cap for the name It's a dip of"
"5029150","5033090"," buying opportunity or indicative of tougher times ahead We're going to discuss with one former"
"5033090","5225610"," board member of the company after the break Tesla"
"5225610","5230350"," share is trying to get back some energy today after their steep drop yesterday We're staying a few"
"5230350","5235190"," years, but still on pace to end the way down Let's get the domed shoe and see where things stand"
"5235190","5240090"," All right, so car we are still a far cry away from where we were at the peak market value"
"5240090","5245570"," for tesla Back in the early part of 2020 When it was worth close to once and a quarter trillion"
"5245570","5251730"," dollars in market cap now under 600 billion dollars Tesla though still over the last year of 15"
"5251730","5257670"," Again, we've seen some movement down to the at least shorter to medium term to the downside here on"
"5257670","5262510"," tesla So how exactly do things stand after the earnings report and then where analysts have kind of"
"5262510","5267350"," tilted their coverage Well, it turns out that a lot more of them are a little bit more neutral on"
"5267350","5272510"," them these days Currently tesla shares and the analysts who cover them have about 39 Of them saying"
"5272510","5279650"," buy 45 percent say hold and roughly 16 percent have a sell They've got a 221 dollar and 25 cent"
"5279650","5285290"," average target price That's according to the data from fact set that implies roughly a 20 percent"
"5285290","5289930"," gain from current prices where we are So we'll see if that trend holds and then if you take a"
"5289930","5294670"," look at the waking stack up with regard to tesla's value From a price to earnings perspective"
"5294670","5299990"," against some of the other mega cap technology and communication type names out there Forward price"
"5299990","5300590"," to earnings ratio. "
"5300890","5306010"," So what you pay today in price for every year or every dollar of expected earnings in this past"
"5306010","5315230"," year Meta platforms is currently at 22 times in videos at 29 times Microsoft at 33 amazon at 42 and"
"5315230","5320450"," tesla currently trades with a forward valuation of 55 times earnings So david when you talk about"
"5320450","5324630"," the relative valuation, yes, these are not apples to apples They all do kind of different things"
"5324630","5329350"," but to put it in kind of that mega cap technology perspective It's still trades at a relatively"
"5329350","5332550"," rich valuation compared to other mega cap tech stocks."
"5332570","5337830"," I'll send things back over to you david Particularly as estimates come down for this year and next"
"5337830","5343230"," uh don thank you Our next guest saying when it comes to tesla, he doesn't always agree with elon"
"5343230","5345730"," musk But he made the company what it is."
"5345890","5350370"," Let's bring in a former tesla board member steve wesley to discuss steve always good to have you"
"5350870","5356590"," Um, you've been positive and rightly so for quite some time on the company on the stock to a"
"5356590","5361930"," certain extent But I do wonder after listening to yesterday's call Obviously the competition that"
"5361930","5368130"," has come to the fore the price cuts the lack of any real catalyst in 2024 seemingly where you stand"
"5368130","5372850"," right now Well, let's give tesla credit or credit student. "
"5373050","5379070"," They just posted not one but three consecutive great years They grew 71 percent in 2020."
"5379590","5386770"," They grew 51 percent in 2021 last year 19 percent Those are great numbers The challenge is going to"
"5386770","5391650"," be 2024 because they're in between new product offerings The model three model wide phenomenal"
"5391650","5397230"," successes model wide today the largest selling vehicle in the world gas or electric stunning, but"
"5397230","5404570"," what about 2024 What they really need to catch up growth wise with the byd that grew Uh,"
"5404630","5410910"," proportionally 70 last year delivered 1.6 million vehicles the tesla is 1.8 They're going to pass"
"5410910","5418790"," tesla this year for sure Tesla desperately needs to get that $25,000 model into market by late next"
"5418790","5423930"," year So for this year, you know, they've got three shots on goal here that they're telling analysts"
"5423930","5429150"," You're the first is the the $25,000 model, but how soon can you get that out?"
"5429650","5433910"," The second is they're clearly a leader in autonomous driving robo taxis I think that's at least"
"5433910","5438730"," three to five years out the interesting play that few people talk about Is the tesla energy"
"5438730","5440670"," division did six billion this year?"
"5440670","5443190"," It's growing at 54 percent a year."
"5443310","5448230"," They're working on being essentially the world's largest utility Um, that's an interesting play. "
"5448370","5454010"," Those are numbers most auto companies would die for the 2024 is going to be a tough year Tesla's"
"5454010","5458530"," going to have to execute on everything they do from opening the plant in mexico To getting the plan"
"5458530","5463450"," in india bill to uh selling some more cybertruck It's going to be an interesting battle at the"
"5463450","5468510"," chinese are coming Yeah, the Chinese are coming byd has an automobile out there that is a real"
"5468510","5473030"," competitor Not just in the chinese market, of course, but in europe as well probably never going to"
"5473030","5475530"," be here So I wonder are they up to it?"
"5475750","5478110"," Do you think that you know again though that timetable?"
"5479170","5484390"," Must because typically been optimistic when it comes to the timing of things and sometimes Uh wrong"
"5484390","5488430"," do you think they can get there in terms of that model you're talking about to make them"
"5488430","5494670"," competitive as soon as the end of next year I think they'll get initial sales out by then but they"
"5494670","5495470"," need to do better."
"5495610","5500490"," Here's the big picture most Uh investors don't fully understand we're living in an international"
"5500490","5508010"," world tesla dominates the us 51 market share more than everybody else combined But we're now The"
"5508010","5515330"," second largest market in the world after china chinese sold 8 million Evs last year all of europe"
"5515330","5521550"," together did about 2.6 to 3 million Us and canada did 1.6 million."
"5521950","5524170"," So where do you want to be number one china?"
"5524170","5531230"," So us dominating tesla dominating in us Dominating frankly in euro but they've got to get out to"
"5531230","5536310"," that rest of the world because that is where the money is being made But there's one other issue"
"5536310","5541410"," investors need to look at and that is for the last 10 years that it comes to evs It's all"
"5541410","5544770"," been about range and price now. "
"5544870","5552390"," It's moving over to being about Terrace and privacy because as you point out You know will tesla"
"5552390","5557710"," and will be yd come to us They're absolutely coming to us already selling buses here successfully"
"5558390","5563650"," They've started selling in europe But consumers are increasingly going to ask the question Do I"
"5563650","5568630"," feel comfortable driving a car with a chinese iot device that knows where i'm going maybe listening"
"5568630","5569250"," in on me?"
"5569570","5574290"," That's a big issue and then the tariff issue is another big one Us needs to be careful on terrors"
"5574290","5580750"," because we may feel good with the 25% tariff we've slapped on But there's a much bigger auto market"
"5580750","5585810"," in china than there is here and if china reciprocates We may think twice about that."
"5585850","5593610"," Yeah What about just the promise of roe in the u.s market Not that was i'm thinking back about"
"5593610","5599490"," Dom's Pe line up about how it's even rich or valued than some of the big tech stocks I mean"
"5599490","5603890"," don't even try to compare it to some of the auto stocks in terms of valuation and the idea was"
"5603890","5609910"," that tesla is dominant It's a it's a leader and there's just so much growth Are there questions now"
"5609910","5615110"," about the kind of growth for electric vehicle adoption in the united states that like our americans"
"5615110","5617250"," going to get there Is that our future still?"
"5618410","5624390"," There is no doubt Every auto company in the world is going all electric and the simple reason for"
"5624390","5630510"," that is battery prices went down 14 Last year they're going to go down another 10 12 or 14 percent"
"5630510","5633690"," next year They're simply put not only going to be better."
"5634050","5639470"," They're going to be cheaper But the big issue is you've got to discuss the pensoil in the luxury"
"5639470","5644350"," market in the middle market with the model three and the model Why they need a market for people"
"5644350","5652710"," that are first year out of college Firefighters Five thousand dollar nine To get there the big pay"
"5652710","5654290"," of price for it longer term. "
"5654330","5659450"," I think it looks great Steve real quick if you're on the board right now, how would you react to"
"5659450","5667350"," musk's discussion slash Asking for This more voting control would it something would it be"
"5667350","5672590"," something you would say sure you can have more voting control Well, thankfully i'm not on the board"
"5672590","5677470"," right now If you're just lost 80 billion dollars in market cap, I think that shareholders have"
"5677470","5684670"," spoken on that one Look, it's tough for the board because tesla has elons made this company But do"
"5684670","5689850"," I see them giving him You know, 80 billion dollar bonus or 25 percent control the company."
"5690250","5695010"," I think that is a longer shot Plus he has his own AI company."
"5695010","5696410"," So there's an apparent conflict. "
"5696710","5697870"," I think that one's a stretch."

"6567160","6567700"," Is it high?"
"6567980","6575220"," Well, first of all One of the surprises Surprise for the surprise for most economists and certainly"
"6575220","6582920"," for the Fed is that at a very low unemployment rate You've seen saw continued solid job growth, but"
"6582920","6589980"," declining inflation that that's not a conventional outcome So it's taking them some time to to"
"6589980","6597160"," think about this But going forward things are going to certainly likely to slow and the question is"
"6597160","6604920"," can they continue To see this Solid job growth and declining inflation at a very low unemployment"
"6604920","6614140"," rate without producing price pressures or signs of a corporate cutback in in expansion John given"
"6614140","6619680"," all that we just mentioned rent a median new rents down eight straight months We're looking for"
"6619680","6625940"," signs that may be Hiring trends are are moderating to a degree where there's more discussion of an"

"6631100","6638900"," Oh, yes, certainly by doing about an undershoot relative to Good forecasts, but the it's been"
"6638900","6645260"," recognized for some time of the lag in the housing component in the price indexes That suggests"
"6645260","6651620"," we're going to continue to get good news on on overall price indexes The question is will we"
"6651620","6658680"," continue to see favorable news on Core measures excluding housing that will give the fed comfort"
"6658680","6664580"," and investors comfort That inflation really is coming down in the old argument that the last mile"
"6664580","6669680"," between two and three percent is going to be very sticky Is going to turn out to be as wrong"
"6669680","6675840"," as the earlier pessimism about the prospects for declining inflation without rising unemployment"
"6676460","6680440"," Right, Atlanta fed took a crack at that a couple of weeks ago I think they did a paper I"
"6680440","6685420"," think that said is the last mile more arduous and their general take was was no. "
"6685720","6686120"," Do you agree?"
"6686540","6693340"," I do It's not I've never quite understood why that last bit is going to be so much harder But"
"6693340","6702600"," when after all for most of the decade before the pandemic Prices undershot the fed target So it's"
"6702600","6710660"," not as if the fed has some fine-tuning ability with regard to the economy and inflation And the"
"6710660","6717720"," economy was less inflationary before the pandemic Then the fed had won in fact fed policy was"
"6717720","6723400"," really geared toward trying to get inflation up not the other way around Yeah, remember they"
"6723400","6723980"," changed their framework."
"6723980","6724380"," Yes."
"6724780","6731500"," Oh, yes, exactly And which is why they virtually had guaranteed us that they were going to be late"
"6731500","6737240"," to the party in hiking rates and the good old fed They always keep their word Now it seems to"
"6737240","6743580"," me that the They've pretty much guaranteed in their approach Which still clings to a phillips curve"
"6743580","6749180"," kind of conceptualization that they're going to be late to start But there's no doubt that their"
"6749180","6754980"," policy today is restrictive They recognize that and the question is in the current environment. "
"6755300","6759860"," How long does that make sense to be maintaining a restrictive monetary policy?"
"6760620","6767260"," Yeah, and I think the question on on jobs and how long the strength can continue we are seeing Sort"
"6767260","6768560"," of layoffs here and there."
"6768920","6770120"," Um, certainly in the tech sector."
"6770300","6775740"," I think sales force the latest It's hundreds not thousands or anything and it does feels like it's"
"6775740","6782720"," in a way to pivot around Prioritization of AI unless because of the economy but belt tightening"
"6782720","6787360"," mode margin preservation I mean these are big themes right now in corporate America and I wonder"
"6787360","6792960"," john how long you expect the labor markets remain so strong Oh, I suspect that there is going to be"
"6792960","6800220"," a slowdown in both the Corporate investment and corporate hiring in the coming year It's going to"
"6800220","6806580"," produce a slowdown in job growth and that's going to make the judgment on the economy A bit"
"6806580","6813760"," trickier, but for sure or I should say the all science point to slower growth than in the past year"
"6814260","6820840"," But it doesn't there's no clear sign of imbalances that would lead you to expect recession Hey,"
"6820900","6826420"," finally john on that layoff front A lot of companies are restructuring workforces using AI"
"6826420","6833060"," productivity as an excuse or a push On the other hand a lot of people argue that the early"
"6833060","6836860"," experimentation and AI means you still have to correct the things It gets wrong. "
"6837200","6841660"," I wonder where you are on the notion that it's going to bring us a new wave of long-term"
"6841660","6849760"," productivity Hard to know in the short run It's easy to think that the the experts who see big"
"6849760","6857060"," effects from AI in terms of productivity Hopefully are correct Some of those are pessimistic about"
"6857060","6863740"," jobs But it seems to me that in the long run the history of a market economy is improving"
"6863740","6871480"," productivity Ultimately expands both wages and employment John Lipsky always good to get your"

"6901840","6907720"," a may first reduction And the data today even arguably puts march a little more back in play But"
"6907720","6911980"," you know given what john Lipsky was just saying I do agree the fed was late to start fighting"
"6911980","6917460"," inflation The last thing they want to be is too early in terms of Pulling off the breaks and so"
"6917460","6922780"," I think may is the most likely case That gives them a couple more indications of inflation labor"

"6940540","6945080"," Yeah, I mean they're at target if you look at those kind of numbers I guess the question is is"
"6945080","6950420"," And I brought this up earlier what the path they're going on looks like where where are they headed"
"6950420","6954900"," with an economy that's Doing very well in the face of higher interest rates. "
"6955300","6956540"," How much will they have to lower?"
"6957120","6960660"," Well, I think that's where it gets a little more controversial I'm thinking a hundred basis points"
"6960660","6965120"," this year and maybe a hundred basis points next year But I'm assuming the trough of this easing"
"6965120","6969780"," cycle is maybe around three percent three three and a half And I do think the fed wants to have"
"6969780","6975980"," that dry power if you think back a long time ago pre gfc This was the normal level is kind"
"6975980","6981020"," of bounding between three and six in different cycles And I do think by the way that inflation will"
"6981020","6984840"," probably be a little bit higher over the next five to ten years Because some of those structural"
"6984840","6990280"," dynamics that held it down before the pandemic are basically going to be shifting more towards The"
"6990280","6995620"," dynamics around the energy transition and the cost of that and also changes in global supply chains"
"6995620","6999380"," Which will nudge up that inflationary pressure So I think the fed's going to be keeping rates a"
"6999380","7003760"," little bit higher than the market might anticipate speaking of that It is any of the red sea or the"
"7003760","7004820"," the supply chain district."
"7005060","7010040"," Does that keep them on guard in other ways that they wouldn't be otherwise I think really when you"
"7010040","7014480"," look at the shipping cost It's such a small part of the cost of goods sold just within the core"
"7014480","7017980"," pce Goods are only 26 percent of the weight of the index."
"7018340","7022400"," It's really the service sector They're going to be watching and cord goods prices have been going"
"7022400","7023020"," down consistently. "
"7023060","7027200"," You see it in a cpi You see it in the pce I think we've got another six to 12"
"7027200","7031780"," months of cord goods prices going down So we actually got deflation there So I don't think that's"
"7031780","7035540"," going to end up moving the needle very much And christine legard said basically the same thing at"
"7035540","7039700"," the ecb meeting this week So as far as equities go you are looking for a broadening You're not that"
"7039700","7044460"," you're shorting large cap tech Right, right how broad can this get and where would where would"
"7044460","7046520"," others where would people search for first?"
"7046820","7050200"," Well, the way i'm thinking about is we've had a huge run in the magnificence seven and by the way"
"7050200","7054360"," next week will be really interesting We've got five of the seven reporting earnings But the only"
"7054360","7059640"," way that momentum can be sustained Is if the other companies in the market who are buying the"
"7059640","7063900"," products from these seven companies Find that they increase productivity and increase profitability"
"7064380","7068920"," And back to your prior line of questioning with john I do think there's a case to be made that"
"7068920","7074600"," this will be a bumpy road We have to figure out how to use ai in the workplace All of"
"7074600","7078140"," the workers me included have to figure out how to use it in our day-to-day life and how"
"7078140","7083100"," to make it improve our efficiency I think that's going to take some time and so the broadening out"
"7083100","7087700"," will have to wait and see do companies get the benefits And oh by the way in the interim We've"
"7087700","7092060"," got a good economic backdrop So, you know the seven companies in tech are not the only companies"
"7092060","7097860"," that are going to grow earnings this year I think that's the bigger story of 2024 is macro being de "
"7097860","7101280","-emphasized in the micro company specific Increasing in importance."

"7107380","7112620"," the economic data kind of a mixed picture there Yeah, and to be fair I do think growth will be"
"7112620","7119600"," slower in 2024 than it was in 2023, but let's acknowledge 2023 was really good I mean I and a"
"7119600","7123840"," lot of people expected that recession risk was high We were wrong the economy is in a very good"
"7123840","7124140"," place."
"7124680","7130920"," We should expect some deceleration Finally the debate we keep having is about sideline cash, right?"
"7131140","7132720"," And how much equity's benefit from whatever?"
"7133940","7136640"," Allocation changes people make to their cash. "
"7136880","7137940"," Is that do you believe in that?"
"7138240","7143120"," I do believe that should add a positive leg to the story earnings growth should be good Economic"
"7143120","7149140"," growth is good valuations of the broad market the equal weighted s&p or below 17 times So not"

"7154660","7155840"," all of that going to go into equities?"
"7156040","7160140"," No But some of that probably will move back in and we're having a lot more conversations with"
"7160140","7164380"," people thinking Maybe I need to figure out what to do with that cash because 5% is going to"
"7164380","7168280"," go to 4 and go to 3 Really quickly since you're at lizard I mean, what do you guys expecting"
"7168280","7171820"," for capital markets activity this year given the very benign backdrop?"
"7172040","7176780"," You just laid out I think this is a backdrop that is good for Fundraising whether it be equity"
"7176780","7181320"," capital markets or debt capital markets credit spreads are very narrow So if you need to issue"
"7181320","7186540"," debt, you've got lower rates than we had not too long ago tight credit spreads on the equity side"

"9848940","9849980"," Will they declare victory?"
"9850480","9855600"," What will they say about cuts and how soon they may come given these benign inflation reports that"

"9868680","9874940"," Hello AI 5 We'll trade a debate the new most important names in the market at least according to"
"9874940","9879340"," one well-known tech investor Joining you for the hour today josh brown brin talkington jenny"
"9879340","9883820"," harington jin layton ball let's check the markets We are green across the board today."
"9884220","9891260"," We have the s&p sitting above 4900 dows above 38,000 We had a good pce the ten years"
"9891260","9897260"," at 414 or so And josh brown we get ready for a big week mega cap earnings the fed meeting"
"9897260","9899020"," There's your ten-year note there. "
"9899260","9902560"," Um, so how should we be thinking about the week that was and the one that will be?"
"9903000","9911760"," I think probably The big tailwind that sends us into next week and of course those earnings will be"
"9911760","9916060"," pivotal pivotal just mathematically Those stocks are really big."
"9916420","9921220"," They really move the market when they go up and down The commentary that you'll hear out of those"
"9921220","9926600"," management teams will absolutely Impact the way people are feeling about the outlook for other"
"9926600","9929480"," stocks that they own Um, but we don't know what's coming out yet."
"9929480","9930360"," So let's put that aside. "
"9930560","9937460"," I think the Thing that's really going to send us into those reports with a decent tailwind is this"
"9937460","9944680"," core pce number Remember that the fed focus is more on this than they do on cpi Um, and now"
"9944680","9952320"," you've got basically a six month and a three month annualized sub two percent inflation regime and"
"9952860","9960180"," That's like at this point I think that that could clinch the the the rate cut cycle beginning."
"9960540","9967900"," So right now the street is only Uh assigning a 53 probability to the first cut happening in march"
"9968560","9973560"," Um, that's down from a month ago, but up from a week ago I guess is the best way to"
"9973560","9973880"," put it."
"9974200","9979740"," I spoke with uh meal dutta from red mac He's the only wall street economist who told you a year"
"9979740","9985940"," ago No recession in 2023 We had this huge debate all year hard landing or soft landing. "
"9986100","9987200"," He said how about no landing?"
"9987820","9993500"," Um meal thinks they go in march and this print that we see today gives them cover to do that"
"9993500","9994840"," Even better though."
"9995080","10001460"," I want to point out the 10 year to a year, uh spread This is about to uninvert It's been"
"10001460","10004420"," trending in that direction for a while Right now."
"10004420","10011540"," It's at negative point one four Outside of the negative point one three that had hit in october"
"10012000","10015880"," This is the closest we've been to an uninversion. "
"10016280","10023000"," We've had an inverted yield curve for what seems like Years now to me that becomes really important"
"10023000","10029120"," also Especially when you think about all of the negative sentiment around whether or not okay We"
"10029120","10030320"," didn't have the 23 recession."
"10030660","10031780"," Maybe the 24 recession."
"10032500","10038580"," I think that uninversion happens probably Coinciding with this weight cut cycle getting underway"
"10038580","10042480"," and I think we should be keeping our eye on it So jimmy, we're going to get to mega caps"
"10042480","10049140"," and the earnings and all that but I love what least men um posted today By way of capital economics"
"10049140","10055160"," quote immaculate disinflation nearly complete It's time for the fed officials to take the win and"
"10055160","10059340"," start dialing back the level of policy Restrictiveness soon now. "
"10059720","10064840"," I know the market has sort of Further backed away from the idea of march."
"10065100","10070920"," It's it's josh said a touch less than 50 But I wonder What kind of clues we might get from"
"10070920","10076740"," the fed chair this week or next week excuse me and how that's going to impact the trade In the"
"10076740","10081900"," in the days and weeks ahead So great macro analysis from josh just now and I like steves comments"
"10081900","10087640"," as well I can't overstate the importance of the two handle on the pce both on the headline and the"
"10087640","10092360"," core level But here's why it matters to me as a stock investor It's not actually the macro"
"10092360","10097220"," environment because I think most of us Have been for quite some time on the soft or if you want"
"10097220","10099280"," to call it in a no landing scenario That's fine."
"10099440","10100940"," Here's why it matters to me though. "
"10101060","10102080"," I'm going to be honest with you."
"10102220","10105000"," I'm not very happy with the earnings season so far It's not been good."
"10105160","10106820"," Let's just not okay good ourselves. "
"10107240","10107820"," It's out there right?"
"10108020","10112100"," We're talking about it now We can be honest, which sets the stage for next week even more so it"
"10112100","10115040"," it does but let me also just say this Let's okay."
"10115360","10119980"," Just said it right the earnings season so far is not good But if you have further indications as"
"10119980","10124040"," josh and steve We're just talking about that the fed really should be taking the wind and taking"
"10124040","10129760"," the wind and taking its foot off the brake pedal Then that means that the stock market can give a"
"10129760","10136420"," little more time like another quarter or so for earnings to start to increase I'm looking right now"
"10136420","10141760"," calendar year 24 estimates from from the macro analyst community They're at the lowest they've been"
"10141760","10148220"," around 242 actually just under 242 We need those revisions to start peaking up not down Which is"
"10148220","10151920"," what they've done for a year And I think if the fed can take its foot off the brake, you'll"
"10151920","10156460"," start to get those revisions going up That's why today's news matters to me profits profit growth"
"10156460","10161760"," Yeah, brin the market is is a bit looking through Some of these disappointing earnings reports too."
"10161880","10168020"," I we said the s&p is at 4,900 above above that now And dow is you know nicely"
"10168020","10176300"," above 38,000 38174 with with today's gain It does set the stage though for pivotal week Whether"
"10176300","10182340"," powell moves the market or these mega cap earnings do Right. "
"10182560","10188220"," I mean, I think ultimately the pce today Is the information that we needed that yes inflation is"
"10188220","10189940"," slowing That the fed can start."
"10190120","10191560"," I don't think the fed's going to go in March."
"10191560","10196760"," That's why that's my guess I think they they wait they wait another meeting Just to make sure"
"10196760","10202220"," because I once again, I know that j powell definitely has the memory of arthur burns and and"
"10202220","10204640"," doesn't want to repeat The proverbial 1970s. "
"10205140","10209720"," I don't think we will so I think they wait a little bit longer But listen really I mean technology"
"10209720","10214160"," is such a big part of the s&p It's such a big part of earnings when the mega caps"
"10214160","10218500"," really start to print to start coming out with earnings I think they're going to be good And I"
"10218500","10223800"," think they're going to be Abulant in their conversation around AI and I think that's really when"
"10223800","10226440"," things are going to start Flushing out."
"10226900","10231460"," I do think the biggest date will be february 21st though when in video comes out To me, that's"
"10231460","10235740"," going to be the pivotal moment if we can continue to go higher I'm in tech or we're going to"
"10235740","10241040"," start to take a breather You know jenny I almost feel like we need to get away from this idea"
"10241740","10247380"," I think the market is telling you this in some respects that A strong economy means that the feds"
"10247380","10251340"," worried that inflation is going to come back They bring mixed the arthur burns reference from the"
"10251340","10258300"," 70s etc When the evidence would almost suggest otherwise because the economy is strong The data"
"10258300","10261660"," continues to be good And inflation continues to go down."
"10261740","10267940"," Okay, the pce is the latest evidence It's the feds favorite read and that suggests that which is"
"10267940","10273540"," why the fed decided and made it clear in the past That they're not so worried about choking off the"
"10273540","10278480"," economy anymore at all They're more worried about getting inflation down and it is in their favor. "
"10278820","10284620"," They are winning So what I think I think we're losing sight of when we're talking about the fed"
"10284620","10287560"," starting to cut and when they cut You know, what does that really mean?"
"10288060","10294840"," And I think we've become so accustomed to thinking of fed cuts as stimulating Right and all these"
"10294840","10299220"," really doing they will be okay, but they shouldn't they will be you know what they should be what"
"10299220","10301000"," they really are They're normalizing."
"10301280","10308780"," So if we get three which is when you're normalizing from The degree in which they hiked yes, that's"
"10308780","10313000"," stimulative, but it should but it really shouldn't be right It's not them reducing the economy."
"10313220","10317760"," It's not them bringing rates back down to zero and saying like hey You know, you get to borrow for"
"10317760","10323960"," for nothing forever and just go crazy and and unbalance the risk-reward scenario No, but 2% is"
"10323960","10328780"," better than 5% it is better, but it's not what we were at It's not I think I really"
"10328780","10333020"," think that people out there when they ran the market up in December And people were talking about"
"10333020","10338680"," and the market was kind of pricing in like six rate cuts That was pricing in act like active"
"10338680","10343180"," intense stimulation ahead and that's not what really we should be looking at We should be looking"
"10343180","10348580"," at normalization, which then says to you what's the right market multiple And I would argue it's"
"10348580","10352480"," not what it was in a highly stimulative environment that we're in It's not 21 times. "
"10352880","10358060"," It's not 20 times like you know what it's probably somewhere between 17 and 19 times Which is above"
"10358060","10363680"," the 16 times that it was so I'm really cautious going into next week And in our equity income"
"10363680","10368280"," strategy and the dividend portfolio right that we've got about 10% cash in our growth strategy"
"10368280","10369660"," We've got about 7% cash."
"10369660","10371560"," Why are you so cautious going into next week?"
"10372140","10376840"," Because I think they're you know, I know we'll get into Intel later But I think there's a lot of"
"10376840","10381820"," hope and expectation in shares and so when we say it's not been a great earnings season Actually,"
"10382040","10388640"," the numbers are coming in okay But there was so But there was so much anticipation in so many"
"10388640","10394100"," stocks that I don't think whatever whatever said next week It's hard to imagine it can it can keep"
"10394100","10394280"," up."
"10394440","10396260"," I mean we're talking about the AI5. "
"10396260","10397540"," That sounds super cool, right?"
"10397680","10399100"," It sounds like mi5."
"10399160","10400880"," It sounds really really I don't know."
"10401020","10401980"," I don't want to say bad words on TV. "
"10402100","10402820"," It just sounds really cool."
"10403180","10406420"," So um But there's the excitement."
"10406880","10411180"," There's a euphoria There's an irrationality for what those valuation should be and when we get"
"10411180","10415580"," later in the show too I'll tell you something we sold it's a great company But the problem is that"
"10415580","10420340"," when something trades at 57 times earnings no matter how great it is the story and the valuation no"
"10420340","10424600"," longer work And I think that that's what we might get into next week, which is saying like great"
"10424600","10425680"," story, but you know what?"
"10425800","10426600"," But see that's the argument. "
"10426900","10430600"," I don't know Bryn that's the argument that people who haven't been in the right stocks continue to"
"10430600","10437100"," make They justify it by the valuations are too rich Whereas the valuations have been justified in"
"10437100","10442920"," many respects by the guidance and the promise And in even a greater degree the monetization that's"

"10448120","10454060"," I mean so like Nvidia in terms of you would never have bought one would never have bought Nvidia If"
"10454060","10458100"," they focused on the valuations because it would just been too expensive I mean, Jenny obviously"
"10458100","10459180"," runs an equity income."
"10459480","10465940"," So so so so that aside, but I think it's important valuations and multiples are really a terrible"

"10470480","10475440"," But I think that what you're going to see especially in certain companies and we'll get to Intel"
"10475440","10480380"," But I mean there's a you could drive a bus through the difference between an Intel and an AMD and"
"10480380","10485560"," an Nvidia So I think you're going to continue to see a dispersion Within these companies and if you"
"10485560","10491220"," don't deliver whether it was Tesla two days ago or it was Intel today The streets going to cut your"

"10513280","10518340"," He doesn't own it anymore sold it at the end of last year Obviously been a dumpster fire this year"

"10523720","10532360"," AI five from here forward He says microsoft and vidia AMD Taiwan semi and broadcom Those are the"
"10532360","10533680"," ones you should be focused on now."
"10534040","10540020"," I'll also say he likes meta a lot still and he's in it Obviously conspicuously absent is alphabet"

"10565240","10572080"," their from back then Some of them do but like many of them spent like decades as a shadow of"
"10572080","10578880"," their former selves I'm looking at you in telensisco So that's really really tough to do that kind"
"10578880","10584920"," of uh thing It's easy to say here are the companies that right now have the most sales growth"
"10584920","10590060"," directly as a result of the AI Revolution saying all right, let's take it for face value at that. "
"10590060","10591600"," Everyone knows that well."
"10591600","10596680"," I don't know I don't think i don't think i don't think i don't know for focusing on Taiwan semi"

"10603820","10610420"," I think enough people focus on the outcome for example Maybe not but you're talking about some of"

"10611780","10614680"," They're not four trillion But they're not 20 billion."
"10614680","10617260"," They're not um They're not like on discovered gems."
"10617840","10623960"," This is what I would tell you the the most likely outcome of all of this AI spending Is number"
"10623960","10629380"," one a lot of startups are going to come along Some of them will become really important, but a lot"
"10629380","10633700"," of money a lot of a lot of them will go to zero That's perfectly natural and normal. "
"10633940","10638800"," That's how that end of the spectrum works at the other end of the spectrum You have four trillion"
"10638800","10639480"," dollar companies."
"10640040","10642080"," Maybe some of them should be five trillion."
"10642520","10647620"," We'll find that out Um, but where the real money is going to be made is in the middle by"
"10647620","10653220"," the types of companies that jenny owns The types of companies that jim owns if you have companies"
"10653220","10660780"," that are normally spending Ex dollars on labor and related overhead that can cut those numbers over"
"10660780","10666940"," the next 10 years That money will drop directly to the bottom line Even if you assume a higher cap"
"10666940","10674060"," x or tech spend in order to get there the true promise of AI May not necessarily reward the"
"10674060","10682100"," shareholders in the most AI relevant companies the true promise is probably going to be a profit"
"10682100","10688940"," margin story For all of the other companies that have nothing to do with AI And that for me is"
"10688940","10694780"," is a reason to be bullish but not be focused on just five stocks Well, I just think it's so"
"10694780","10698880"," cool that we're finally changing the conversation from mag seven to AI five because you know what"
"10698880","10700620"," that is That's leadership rotation. "
"10701080","10705220"," And so when josh says you could back look back to 1998 I think microsoft was actually one of them"
"10705220","10710320"," in 1998 But we need to be really aware that the leadership rotates and so when brin you know brin"
"10710320","10714900"," I think you're a little cast and saying Valuations a trap, but actually it's not because of her for"
"10714900","10719420"," the last three years I've been saying tesla should be priced more like a car company and they're"
"10719420","10719960"," all these arguments."
"10719960","10722060"," No, it's a technology company No, it's a battery company."
"10722300","10726280"," You know what it's behaving like a car company and it's being priced like a car company I think I"
"10726280","10727340"," think brin to be fair. "
"10727500","10733040"," I think her greater point is don't Buy or sell or trade stocks around just because evaluation you"
"10733040","10738060"," have to have it both working You could make the argument for valuation on microsoft and the story"
"10738060","10743520"," can make the argument for valuation on in video Story, no, but if you say Things are different if"
"10743520","10749680"," you Nvidia's valuation is lower now than it was Six months ago, right?"
"10749860","10753840"," So the stock price is higher today than it was six months ago If you would have sold it six"
"10753840","10755200"," months ago, right?"
"10755880","10761020"," But of course, that's what my point is if you would have sold it six months ago based on evaluation"
"10761020","10763180"," You thought was elevated this is my point."
"10763320","10768300"," This is the exact reason why you don't okay But you had to even six months ago say is the"
"10768300","10770180"," story working and is the valuation working?"
"10770320","10774780"," And for the last three years, I've been saying on tesla the valuations working Sorry, the story"
"10774780","10778480"," works the valuation does yeah, but you're telling me that microsoft story isn't working because the"
"10778480","10781300"," valuations at 35 That's why it gets to stay in the ai five."
"10781640","10783540"," That's why it gets to stay in that group, right?"
"10783720","10788020"," So who's been kicked out facebook's bet meta's been kicked out tesla's been kicked out meta is"
"10788020","10790820"," working It's not really not going to be the leadership. "
"10791060","10796900"," I don't I mean at least according to the ai five Meta just had its best year ever for sure"
"10796900","10797740"," now coming off."
"10797880","10801440"," It's worse Have that kind of year again in the future and so what are we talking about now?"
"10801560","10807240"," We're talking about AMD and TSMC in ways that we haven't before Leadership is rotating and that's"
"10807240","10810900"," how it should be but you have to you don't sell something just because of the valuation You don't"
"10810900","10814740"," sell something just because of the story You don't buy it just because of either of both either But"
"10814740","10819760"," you have to look at the valuation otherwise you're going to sit in a tesla ride it down 50 And"
"10819760","10821760"," like the like well, it's a cool story people."
"10821920","10822560"," I find it stuff. "
"10822700","10824620"," I think you have to look at both all the time."
"10824820","10831500"," Yeah Well, so so first of all on tesla I mean tesla's one of the best performing stocks of all"
"10831500","10832780"," time in the last five years."
"10832800","10840140"," It's just over 800 So so let's just like not pile on tesla because the past two quarters they're in"
"10840140","10844380"," a transition They didn't have a great call the last two quarters, but come on This is like one of"
"10844380","10850380"," the most innovative not only like automobile company manufacturing company technology company, etc"
"10850380","10854880"," etc of our time So if you don't want to buy tesla, that's fine But to say it's like a"
"10854880","10858640"," dumpster farm not done well That's just that's just not accurate by the way. "
"10858660","10863520"," It's been an amazing performer Okay, and I think that when it comes to valuations With a dumpster"
"10863520","10867640"," farm recently Not talking about a five year 20 year chart."
"10867660","10868460"," Yeah, you know what I mean?"
"10869080","10874600"," But I think when it when it's got when it comes to valuations Really where where I stand is that"
"10874600","10879920"," really it's not do I think the market do I think the valuation is too cheap or too expensive It's"
"10879920","10883860"," what multiple is the market willing to pay for stock x?"
"10884520","10889280"," And that's really where the hard work comes in to say I think the markets miss pricing it or over"
"10889280","10893720"," pricing is like there's no reason Microsoft should trade it a 35 or whatever it is."
"10893840","10898120"," It's just that there's a market thinks that's the multiple It should be a year from now it could"
"10898120","10902480"," say it should be a 20 And so that's where I think that valuations can be a trap Because you"
"10902480","10907740"," just don't know the whims in the sentiment of the market and the multiple The market wants to price"
"10907740","10908800"," on an individual name. "
"10909040","10916800"," Well, I mean the the market was obviously Miss pricing intel Because the stock had a 30 some odd"
"10916800","10923500"," percent run up into the print and today It is getting crushed right on the outlet christina parts"
"10923500","10929300"," of novellous is sitting at the desk with us today to sort of give us a sweep Of that You"
"10929300","10934460"," know expectations, I guess we're up going in because of the stock appreciation Yes going from 32"
"10934460","10939260"," bucks early september to 50 bucks in december the expectations were definitely there And I think it"
"10939260","10943380"," was reset after this earnings report and much of it not had to have to do with the q1 guidance"
"10943820","10946420"," And not q4 performance because it wasn't that bad q4."
"10946560","10951440"," They actually did really well But it's the guidance that was 18 percent a lower quarter over"
"10951440","10957600"," quarter lower than every single analyst estimate out there The company so I caught up with some"
"10957600","10961460"," management on a call before their earnings call and they listed three things They reiterated in the"
"10961460","10967520"," call they blamed mobile eye because they are the majority shareholder mobile eye does Autonomous"
"10967520","10972220"," driving technology they blame blamed their programmable chips department Which is a little bit"
"10972220","10976880"," weaker as more people shift their money towards I you know AI related chips and maybe away from"
"10976880","10979360"," other specific ones And the last of the foundry business."
"10979780","10985840"," So that's actually an argument for the bears Hey those three items that they listed are not part of"
"10985840","10990480"," their let's say core business So it's an opportunity for intel to turn themselves around but then"
"10990480","10995680"," you have the the bears out there the same How long do we have to wait for this transition period?"
"10995680","10999980"," Well, Stacy Raskin of Bernstein says quote how many times can intel push the reset exactly?"
"11000220","11004100"," So now he I think Stacy is pushing it to 2026 I think in his note But a lot of"
"11004100","11008960"," people are just staying on the sidelines hoping for this change and there's still some like hope"
"11008960","11010460"," That's the key part with intel. "
"11010820","11015040"," They're trying they're still on their roadmap for their product launches They signed a new foundry"
"11015040","11017040"," customer But how long do you have to wait?"
"11017180","11021360"," And so for to your point starting this conversation people got into the stock Maybe not realizing"
"11021360","11026480"," the timing of this turnaround and the timing of things to progress Even though intel promises that"
"11026480","11032220"," every quarter after q1 will increase incrementally sequentially as well as your rear in 2024 Hope"
"11032220","11039220"," is a dangerous thing Shawshank Yeah, but it depends on the time of entry you still have hope at"
"11039220","11044220"," this point I do I don't think we're gonna have Okay, so first of all you're totally right that"
"11044220","11048540"," expectations are too high and that's why I'm nervous about next week So why do I help hope yeah"
"11048540","11054020"," because we need to remember that they that what pat galsinger is doing is taking a strong page from"
"11054020","11058960"," jamie diamond Which is under promise over deliver right so when he resets these we need to remember"
"11058960","11066880"," They actually just beat q4 earnings by 23% and so I don't really and I was actually surprised By"
"11066880","11071980"," the magnitude of decline today just in that I thought like data center had already been accounted"
"11071980","11076280"," for Yes, I knew there was a lot of hope in the stock that things up a hundred percent since"
"11076280","11081140"," february last year It was down at 23 that well was at 47 that you know last night So about"
"11081140","11085320"," a hundred percent in the last year that says there's a lot of emotion a lot of stock in there"
"11085320","11087340"," But why did I stick with it last year?"
"11087980","11091860"," Because we thought they can return to two dollars of earnings this gets back of the hope they can"
"11091860","11096620"," return to two dollars of earnings They're on track to do that last year is trading at 12 times when"
"11096620","11099520"," it was at 23 Now it's trading at 25 times."
"11099520","11103840"," I figure you take the gift of the stock appreciation and say gosh waiting for this and best Yeah,"
"11103960","11108720"," but I'm not selling it down 10 percent today because I think that this is a little bit overdone I"
"11108720","11114180"," think it was actually kind of a fine quarter I think they're doing at this point more than I"
"11114180","11119060"," expected they would be doing last year Things are getting better faster, but it can't be a straight"
"11119060","11123820"," line Right, you know, not everything seamless, but I really do think if we look back since pat"
"11123820","11129100"," gelsinger has been there He has under promised and over delivered almost every single quarter Um,"
"11129220","11133680"," there might have been one where it wasn't quite perfect I don't have in front of me what the"
"11133680","11135880"," performance of the stock is since since mr."
"11136080","11141700"," Gelsinger came back, but Um, maybe we can it's not good we could I know it's not but let's just"
"11141700","11144020"," like flat We can work it up in the control room."
"11144020","11148020"," Perhaps if we have time guys if you can do it great if not totally get it We want to"
"11148020","11153300"," say let's compare it to the let's compare it to the sector Okay, but hang on we can do both"
"11153300","11158100"," but christina wait wait compare intel so the second but just to your point Yeah, february 21st the"
"11158100","11162540"," foundry day might actually be an opportunity to get out if you would because they may announce a"
"11162540","11166840"," new customer I don't know this but there's an opportunity to see the stock regain a little bit Uh"
"11166840","11171580"," comparing it to the sector intel actually outperform at the smh in the stocks over the last three"
"11171580","11175740"," months leading into this earnings report smh is a whole other story that it may be an overbought"
"11175740","11182400"," territory, but In part of that category when you divide the compute versus non-compute an intel was"
"11182400","11187600"," sort of in between both and now we're seeing that negative reaction To this weakness in data center"
"11187600","11193320"," revenue loss of market share that amd too christina You know, you know my thesis which is that the"
"11193320","11197840"," overall semiconductor industry has has bottomed Okay, and that we're seeing growth and end market"
"11197840","11202400"," demand whether it's laptops whether it's smartphones now There's a thin line between hope and"
"11202400","11202880"," expectations. "
"11203260","11207600"," All right My expectations are that it has bottom and it will eventually support intel and qualcom"
"11207600","11212940"," and nxb But here's the thing when a market or an industry bottoms not everybody comes out at the"
"11212940","11217400"," same time It just you know, there's only so many incremental orders the first incremental orders"
"11217400","11222420"," have gone to taiwan semi Right there the biggest foundry the incremental orders are not going to go"
"11222420","11227080"," I'm sorry genie to intel which is just getting started in foundries But if the expectation is"
"11227080","11231160"," correct that those end markets have bottom and I really think based on economic strength They have"
"11231160","11235580"," then it's just a matter of time before the positive news that you saw at taiwan semi come through"
"11235580","11241340"," to intel Come through to qualcom come through to nxbi taking nothing away from amd or broadcom or"
"11241340","11243160"," in video How do you feel about what I just said?"
"11243980","11249300"," I agree, but then you are taking that thesis that this is longer than anticipated that you have to"
"11249300","11253170"," stay on the sidelines for a little And then even to frame to amd's on tuesday, right?"
"11253290","11258010"," You're seeing the stock down hyper so slightly down less than 1% today Why is that because amd has"
"11258010","11261690"," a grand exposure to pcs you saw weakness in servers for intel?"
"11262030","11267930"," So this bottoming that's gonna is happened here q1 whatever you want to call it I agree with you on"
"11267930","11268130"," that."
"11268590","11270990"," I just wonder how long do you have to wait for that?"
"11271030","11275790"," That seems to be the question that from investors boy Okay, I'll go back to the shashank thing You"
"11275790","11283350"," only because I think it fits is that You know jimmy says why bother having to tunnel through the"
"11283350","11290830"," wall to you know crawl through five football fields of foulness To get to the other side When it's"
"11290830","11297690"," uncertain what's gonna happen there where amd broadcom Invidia those are proving to be taiwan semi"

"11310410","11311110"," That's that's great."
"11311730","11312490"," It's not great."

"11320690","11325410"," this garbage and it was cheap the whole time and hope that the other side's gonna be better Yeah,"
"11325590","11328770"," and josh if I'd sold when you and I were having an argument about it last year and you were"
"11328770","11332250"," telling this irrelevant Nobody cared about intel anymore and I said to yeah, but they're still"

"11341550","11348850"," It's gonna turn into a bickering No, it's not no, it's not No, it's not listen three years three"

"12626670","12629210"," at $77 a share Three weeks ago. "
"12629310","12633290"," We trimmed it when the stock was at 553 We trimmed it again yesterday after they announced earnings"
"12633290","12639450"," at 653 And it was wild because when we trimmed it yesterday the shares were up $75 a share Which"
"12639450","12644430"," was basically what we paid for it way back and what was interesting was They have a long history of"
"12644430","12648870"," earnings reports that are like Really good and then the stock just goes down for no good reason"
"12648870","12653950"," what happened yesterday was it was a good earnings report Not the best and the stock went up a lot"

"12682070","12686450"," hope that you're going to get a chance to actually sell it with a little bit of a back The"
"12686450","12691050"," inside the psyche of the investor pretty good these two examples I think but it's it's beyond just"
"12691050","12694830"," the psychology too Which is and it gets back to brin's comment about about valuation and how"
"12694830","12699070"," careful you need to be with that being a trap Both on forcing you to stay in and forcing you"
"12699070","12700050"," to sell out right?"
"12700270","12703550"," So when when i'm looking at until last you're like well, it's only 12 times historically It's"
"12703550","12708670"," traded this as the stock comes down frequently the valuation comes more and more compelling Causing"

"13733600","13738240"," in his report I don't know whether you're able to hear it He said that there was uh, I guess"
"13738240","13744440"," some weakness in uh, AI chips and data centers Well, those are the two buzzwords these days, right?"
"13744740","13748560"," And and if you're not if you're not hitting there if you can't say we got AI chips and we"

"13753640","13757760"," think though that in the long run this is a stock to own right?"
"13761160","13771100"," We do for two reasons And AI is white hot right now and um specifically in video chips are"
"13771100","13778800"," white hot But here's the thing if if you Get performance to NVIDIA at less than the price of an"
"13778800","13785720"," invidiot chip I think you have a winner and that is why I like both AMD and Intel because That"
"13785720","13793020"," there's a second reason is AI is going to create a tremendous opportunity For downstream chips and"
"13793020","13800880"," that includes data center build outs which Which They are either being built and soaking up all the"
"13800880","13807080"," chips or the companies are taking a break about build out So it is an erratic kind of cycle All"
"13807080","13812540"," right, well speaking of erratic the i'm afraid the audio is a little bit erratic on your feed kim"

"13822020","13829200"," Let's turn to the economy and core pce That is the feds favored gauge of inflation It ticked up a"

"13834300","13840640"," It was up 2.9 That's the core that was slightly less than the forecast our next guest says"

"13867060","13872060"," week Well, the fed is got to be really happy with these numbers."
"13872340","13877300"," They're just stunningly good and the cooling of inflation through productivity growth You just"
"13877300","13878360"," couldn't get it a better way. "
"13878540","13884040"," There's almost a tinge of the 1990s boom in here And I think the feds got to be feeling pretty"
"13884040","13890460"," good about itself that said It still has sort of put itself in this position where it's not ready"
"13890460","13895980"," to cut rates in march But I think by the time they're going to start discussing rate cuts in"
"13895980","13901300"," earnest at the january meeting And then the debate's going to get really heated in march to have"
"13901300","13906560"," that may cut instead of waiting until june This is you know at the same time we have some people"
"13906560","13912040"," rotating into voting positions Who've already sort of staked themselves out as wanting later rate"
"13912040","13913260"," cuts out there?"
"13913440","13918980"," And I think that's what the navigation is going to be but it's going to be hard for chair powell"
"13918980","13925540"," to contain his enthusiasm at the press conference once again After this statement it comes out next"
"13925540","13932940"," week steve once you throw in uh food and energy costs the headline inflation 0.2 percent for the"
"13932940","13938880"," month held steady at 2.6 annually The fed would like to see it maybe a little lower, but this"
"13938880","13941500"," is pretty dog-on-close to their target, isn't it?"
"13943400","13946360"," Yeah, Tyler, where are the party hats in the kazoos?"
"13946720","13952840"," I'm just wondering I mean here we are The thing that was the the first good thing that happened Was"
"13952840","13958180"," that we have the uh core With a two handle on it for the first time and well who knows"
"13958180","13965100"," how long it's been it's been that low I'm looking at the three month annualized core rate as one"
"13965100","13974760"," and a half percent and then um Powell's super core which is uh services Housing at 2.16"
"13974760","13981040"," percent the problem is not where it is now the problem is how long it's been there I think the"
"13981040","13988020"," trouble is I only have this one statement By the fed to go to go on which is when they're"
"13988020","13993120"," going to cut rates and that is that Inflation is heading back down towards the two percent target"
"13993940","14001300"," At a system for sustainability And that you can't really make the sustainable argument Especially"
"14001300","14002900"," just to undercut the data."
"14003160","14009100"," I just gave you Some of this three month and six month annual stuff can be very volatile because of"
"14009100","14014620"," things like Bottom line is For a little bit."
"14014660","14022040"," I don't think March is enough of a little bit For the for the fed to have that confidence that"
"14022040","14026340"," it's headed down to 2 percent on a sustainable basis So that's I think it means a little bit more"
"14026340","14031860"," time, but the numbers are all real good And I see you nodding there so you must agree Yeah, so"
"14031860","14035900"," we're yeah, we're actually you know, Steve and I have not always been in agreement But um we"
"14035900","14040800"," respectfully disagree in a times that we are 100 percent in agreement right now The idea that the"
"14040800","14046600"," fed wants to see I mean we were getting 0.16 So we got 0.17 on that core so"
"14046600","14049980"," we were getting 2.9 The fed had to be getting some more numbers. "
"14050200","14055540"," I knew it was going to crack below three on the core PCE on a europea your basis at the"
"14055540","14061180"," end of the year If we knew it they had to know it That's the good news, but you know,"
"14061360","14065100"," they want to see it down there for a little bit and you're absolutely right They want more proof"
"14065100","14070620"," that it's not only going to get to 2 percent, but stay there They also don't want to get to"
"14070620","14076100"," 2 before they cut and they want to get they want to cut before they get to 2 percent Which"
"14076100","14080540"," is that sort of difficult sort of Balancing act they're doing, but I don't think they're going to"
"14080540","14085500"," get to 2 percent on a europea your basis by may So I think we're in good shape for a"
"14085500","14090320"," may cut and that's when we've had it that is Not necessarily where a lot of people think it will"
"14090320","14095980"," be the biggest bet is on june But I think may makes much more sense and there will be very"
"14095980","14101940"," heated debate about really getting that cut into may And I think you're going to see in march them"
"14101940","14106760"," setting it up with an additional cut instead of just three cuts We've always had four they're going"
"14106760","14113760"," to add a cut into the Sort of summary of economic projections the dot plot as they call it for"
"14113760","14118340"," the year of 2024 Steve what why don't you jump in here and I'd like to get your thoughts on"
"14118340","14125000"," on the growth numbers that came out What was that yesterday 3.3 percent fourth quarter That's"
"14125000","14130260"," exactly where I wanted to go and I'm fascinated by dianza Take on this too."
"14130620","14134980"," I'd like to point out that I always respectfully disagree you can just ask rick santelli about that"
"14134980","14144080"," But um when we do disagree, but but here's the thing I know Here again, I'm looking at the wage"
"14144080","14152780"," numbers dianne inside the personal income numbers 6.7 6.8 percent and rising The question the fed"
"14152780","14159300"," has to ask itself is whether that is Something that should stay its hand or whether or not some of"
"14159300","14165840"," the better productivity numbers We've had recently saying you know what it's okay People can be"
"14165840","14172160"," making more and it not be inflationary if indeed we have these productivity numbers to back it up I"
"14172160","14177400"," bring that up for another reason Which is that people keep pointing to the government stimulus as"
"14177400","14183680"," the reason why the consumer is doing well But they're ignoring these wage numbers that are there"
"14183680","14189020"," Which to me does a lot better job of explaining what Tyler was asking about which is the strength"
"14189020","14195400"," of the economy and the consumer Diane Absolutely, and I grew I agree with you on that and it is"
"14195400","14201040"," one of the things that is the great debate Are wages a problem or not for inflation in the service"
"14201040","14201440"," sector?"
"14201660","14203040"," Will a ceiling a floor?"
"14204060","14209060"," Form under inflation and that's what they're worried about and that's why they need More time for"
"14209060","14213960"," exactly the reasons that you said before they need more time to know that inflation's not only"
"14213960","14219220"," moving towards 2 percent But going to stay there once it gets there that's price stability and I"
"14219220","14224980"," think that's very important The elevated wages are justified if we have continued productivity"
"14224980","14231180"," gains But I do also think it's important January is going to be there's real upside risk to the"
"14231180","14238660"," January employment number We'd laid off on average every January in the 2010s 2.8 7 million people"
"14239180","14244740"," That is a big seasonal to go against last year We only laid off 2.5 million people."
"14245020","14251460"," That's what gave us the strongest month of the year in January for 2023 Which was over 400,000 job"
"14251460","14257580"," gains So we could see an upside surprise on job gains and we still have those union negotiated"
"14257580","14264480"," contracts which buoyed wages in the month of December and had a slight uptick on those average"
"14264480","14270300"," hourly earnings We could see those spill over into more increases in the month of January and"
"14270300","14275260"," they're going to be watching that very closely So I think these are the things the reasons why the"
"14275260","14279720"," Fed doesn't go in March and why we never had a cut in March But why we've stuck to May"
"14279720","14286560"," but also very moderate cuts only 1 percent over the whole year Rather than the one and a half to"
"14286560","14290700"," two that we've seen markets fluctuate between you know I'm going to get Steve's reaction to my"
"14290700","14296680"," question and then I'll turn back to you Diane What did the recent numbers say to you Steve or more"
"14296680","14304020"," pointedly to those in the in the in the in the chatter sphere Who expect the economy to slow down"
"14304020","14305560"," imminently now?"
"14305720","14310860"," We've seen some warnings on corporate earnings from from a variety of companies some of their their"
"14310860","14318000"," guidance has been a little soggy But what do you what do what do these numbers tell you about the"
"14318000","14321260"," prospect for a slowing economy in the first half of the year?"
"14324000","14332100"," the first thing Tyler is to be humble before your predictions here because uh Economists and"
"14332100","14338520"," forecasters have been extremely humbled over the past Year or two and I think that speaks to a"
"14338520","14345520"," dynamic in the economy recovering from the pandemic That has not been one that's expected Any of"
"14345520","14354560"," the models that they have This is number 2023 GDP accelerated from 2022 amid one of the most"
"14354560","14360600"," ambitious rate hikes Cycles the Fed has ever been through so you got to throw a lot of that stuff"
"14360600","14366600"," out What we do know is that the economy seemed able to grow With these high interest or higher"
"14366600","14372360"," interest rates that we had Uh a consumer kept on keeping on in part because of the government"
"14372360","14378620"," stimulus but also because of higher wages So, um, I think to sit here now and say yes The economy"

"20817350","20827090"," have to see how everything falls out of this Uh, but you know not withstanding I think all the"

"20835290","20840430"," of data that we get So you said I think a moment ago, you could get 8 to 10 percent"
"20840430","20846030"," this year I thought the last time we spoke you were thinking maybe 10 to 15 You have you muted"
"20846030","20850750"," those expectations because what we did towards the end of the year and now where the overall"
"20850750","20854050"," multiple has gone to Well, I'm talking about from today."
"20854310","20859430"," We have gone up a few percent So that that does bring us down a little bit and the fact"
"20859430","20865810"," that you know and take a look at the multiple Um, I don't think the Fed is I mean we're"
"20865810","20869710"," going to hear next week I think they're going to be really reluctant to say they're going to be"
"20869710","20876570"," lowering rates soon because the economy is so strong They can afford to stay higher for longer."
"20876870","20882730"," That might disappoint the streets somewhat Although I've maintained that I much rather have a"
"20882730","20888130"," stronger economy with better earnings Than the Fed rapidly lowering rates because they see a"
"20888130","20894030"," recession So, uh, I don't think a a bull market really depends on them lowering rates It's quickly"
"20894030","20900590"," but nonetheless, I think that uh, you know, I I think the rates are going to be staying higher For"
"20900590","20900950"," longer. "
"20901710","20907290"," Maybe that will dampen stocks a bit But I still think I mean look at even 8 to 10 percent"
"20907290","20912590"," That's still a very very good return much better than you can get on bonds Do you think that they"
"20912590","20915550"," broadening out of the market happens more substantially?"
"20915590","20920290"," And that's how you get the 8 to 10 12 whatever percent or is it still going to be a"
"20920290","20923090"," go big and go home market It's so hard to say."
"20923210","20929310"," I mean, you know tesla Is the first of the mag seven to fall if you want to call it"
"20929310","20937790"," that um I think you need more earnings disappointments on those growth stocks To change the"
"20937790","20942190"," momentum, but that's not put that out of You know consideration."
"20942990","20949350"," I think there's a story about how fast things can Can change, uh, I mean we were just hearing about"
"20949350","20954750"," for the passing laws against uh social media I mean, what you know, what happens?"
"20955050","20960630"," I mean, there's a lot of anti tech attitudes What happens if the u.s. Congress decides to move in"
"20960630","20961850"," some way against tech?"
"20962030","20965850"," I mean, what happens to matter what happens to all these companies that depend on that?"
"20966010","20968110"," I mean, there's always threats out there. "
"20968210","20974970"," It isn't always You know smooth sailing and as long as there's those threats out there I would move"
"20974970","20976450"," to those lower be stocks."
"20976870","20983350"," They don't need the growth in order to get the great returns Uh that I think are inherent in their"
"20983350","20988530"," company You don't think that if there are at the words that you just said, you know, these more"
"20988530","20990670"," earnings Disappointments for growth stocks."
"20990930","20992430"," Let's say that happens. "
"20992590","21000930"," Okay Do you really think that those stocks can come down Have some kind of corrective phase And yet"
"21000930","21004470"," the market can still go up because money's going to rotate into those other areas."
"21004470","21006670"," Yeah I think so."
"21006850","21008590"," I mean look at the last two years. "
"21009030","21009730"," I mean last year."
"21009830","21015470"," We saw an incredible increase in growth stocks Uh at the expense of the rest of the market and the"
"21015470","21021650"," year before we saw exactly the opposite We saw a collapse of growth stocks and the rest of the"
"21021650","21026810"," market actually held it up very well So there's a lot of times when you see one segment of the"
"21026810","21032350"," market really move forward without without the other segment moving forward So I can see growth"
"21032350","21040630"," stocks having perhaps a zero year While value stocks could have that 10 15 percent Very positive"
"21040630","21045630"," year I mean, maybe the the course of the maybe the course of interest rates plays plays a role here"
"21045630","21050410"," too In the way that growth stocks trade now you said earlier that you think the fed can afford to"
"21050410","21055190"," stay higher For longer, but you are you concerned at all that they stay too high for too long and"
"21055190","21060190"," snatch the yeah defeat from the jaws of victory When maybe the data now says they actually should"
"21060190","21065610"," cut Well, I mean, I think the inflation data is is is very good."
"21065850","21070430"," Uh the sensitive Inflation data is also very very good. "
"21070750","21072210"," I but the economy is strong."
"21072310","21079930"," Listen, you know, I don't think they're really going to be pushing Strongly to lower rates Until we"
"21079930","21087110"," see the real data weaken and we have not seen the real data weaken now You know, certainly it could"
"21087110","21092410"," happen But I think you would have to see some rise in the unemployment report rising those jobless"
"21092410","21099890"," claims some soft real economic indicators That will persuade them to start moving the the rate down"
"21099890","21105850"," I think at the present time the sticky parts of inflation are such that they can say And I think"
"21105850","21114890"," that j-pow is going to be very reluctant to say Anything about a march decrease Or or even beyond"
"21114890","21119610"," that he's going to say that you know the the data dictates I think the only thing that might be"
"21119610","21125710"," interesting next week is actually Is discussion of whether he's going to nqt or not or whether"
"21125710","21131470"," there's any discussion on that But I think the rate Unchanged of course next week and with no"
"21131470","21137930"," commitment to lower rates in the future Not with the strength of the economy that we see Others are"
"21137930","21142110"," saying, you know, there's no reluctance at all that they're arguing that they should cut on that"
"21142110","21146150"," note Let me bring in our senior economics correspondent steve leeceman to the conversation because"
"21146790","21151630"," You got my attention earlier steve when you posted this thing from capital economics essentially"
"21151630","21158810"," suggesting that this immaculate Disinflation story is here and that quote it's time for fed"
"21158810","21164310"," officials to take the win and start dialing back the level of policy Restrictiveness soon they're"
"21164310","21171910"," arguing to cut and maybe they're arguing to cut as early as march Yeah, I I don't think that's"
"21171910","21177070"," going to happen I understand what capital is saying and I agree with them generally that you do"
"21177070","21182150"," need to Start taking some up, but there's a different scott and I think professor segolated out"
"21182150","21186750"," between What might be called tweaking the rate and cutting rates and I think they're going to be"
"21186750","21193270"," tweaking That'll be a few cuts down and and I think that the the question is and this is again"
"21193270","21200070"," sort of Same line of thinking as the professor, which is If the economy's not broke, how much"
"21200070","21206890"," fixing does the fed actually have to do The numbers we got yesterday in the GDP report were quite"
"21206890","21211630"," striking We've been defying a lot of the textbooks with this strong growth and is declining"
"21211630","21218230"," inflation and i'll just tell you scott that the The land of just printed the first quarter not just"
"21218230","21223530"," be really wary of this number because there's not much to go with it But it's a 3 percent first"
"21223530","21229070"," quarter growth Now that's double what our CNBC rapid update is but still it tells you what the"
"21229070","21231870"," trend has been and the trend has been For stronger growth."
"21232130","21238810"," So it may mean scott and the fed may take a lesson from these numbers and decide It is not"
"21238810","21245570"," that far off the neutral rate that it seeks And so it may decide hey, we don't need to cut"
"21245570","21250650"," down back to two and a half Which is where the neutral rate is we may have to do a"
"21250650","21257530"," few on the edges I still maintain scott that three quarter point cuts is probably the best Bet this"
"21257530","21263250"," year every other meeting where the fed goes carefully Whether that begins in may perhaps in june so"
"21263250","21268550"," the fed cuts on the meetings when they have projections That's one strategy I think marches too"
"21268550","21273290"," early even though the numbers scott are very good when it comes to inflation on three and six month"
"21273290","21277990"," annualized basis I'll tell you what I mean you could build a case steve that that this is arguably"
"21277990","21286610"," the most perfect scenario For the fed in that you have A robust economy you have a robust stock"
"21286610","21294270"," market They can stay high for longer restrictive in some measures if you will And avoid a bernsian"
"21294270","21300350"," mistake if you would of the 70s They don't have to hike again They can stay where they are and"
"21300350","21309250"," feel good about it because the other data about the economy is blend letting them do it I think"
"21309250","21309930"," that's right. "
"21310390","21316350"," Uh, I I do think they need to take a little bit off the top Um Simple math is that"
"21316350","21322330"," they're 300 points tight Which is you take their long run rate and do it In fact the 538 is"
"21322330","21328310"," a little under 300 points of restriction on the economy Let's say uh, they're two and a half new to"
"21328310","21331470"," rate is wrong and it's maybe three or three and a half They're still tight."
"21331770","21337610"," I think there's still some room to let things run The question that the fed has to ask itself is"
"21337610","21343230"," whether something And I'd love the professor's thought on this whether something more profound is"
"21343230","21348390"," happening beneath the economy Productivity has come back scott to the point where we are back on"
"21348390","21354650"," trend There was talk about the idea that maybe we were losing the global supply chain Not really"
"21354650","21359550"," quite sure that's true and i'll give you an example which is pretty A little off beat which is you"
"21359550","21364150"," look at what's happening in the red sea and we have not seen much in the way of pricing pressure"
"21364610","21369350"," It may be that the global supply chain still exists Which is to suggest that Some of the"
"21369350","21375210"," preconditions for the below 2% inflation that we had before the pandemic May still be in place"
"21375210","21379570"," despite people believing that they're going the way I do have a question about corporate"
"21379570","21386290"," profitability in an environment of lowering prices I think companies had it easier when prices were"
"21386290","21386510"," rising."
"21386770","21390430"," I think things get a little tougher for companies But there could be something profound happening"
"21390430","21395950"," beneath the surface and that higher productivity May mean the fed has room to reduce rates without"
"21395950","21403350"," creating inflation professor Yeah, I mean first of all, I agree with Steve I think the neutral rate"
"21403350","21408490"," is three and a half percent I know they had two and a half percent for years But I think"
"21408490","21414690"," that that is so I think we're two percent high and not three percent high We might even be a"
"21414690","21421090"," little bit higher than that And and so I think that that's important. "
"21421490","21429050"," I think one of the reasons That the fed has gotten away with the so-called immaculate Disinflation"
"21429050","21439150"," Is honestly because inflationary expectations Never really rose during the last two years And"
"21439150","21445610"," I think that that has been Uh, that has enabled the fed to slow it down without having to crush"
"21445610","21451830"," it to break expectations If you take a look at those inflationary expectations Figures, yes, they"
"21451830","21456890"," bopped up a bit, but they're all the way back down And I think that's all the difference between"
"21456890","21464310"," this business cycle And what we saw in the 1970s where we had 10% inflation expectations Look a"
"21464310","21465990"," crush to get that economy down."
"21466230","21469590"," It's going to be exciting to look forward to next week I can't wait to see it Steve in the"
"21469590","21473470"," room Uh, wrap it up real quick Steve and then I gotta I want to bring in somebody else Go"
"21473470","21473570"," ahead."
"21473830","21476830"," I see you want to say something I was just going to tell I was just going to tell the"
"21476830","21480390"," professor I was talking this morning with Jeffrey lacquer about the 70s and trying to understand"
"21480390","21485790"," The differences and Jeff lacquer talked about what he called a catastrophic loss of credibility by"
"21485790","21491570"," the federal reserve in the 1970s That is not the case the feds stopped at five percent way too high"
"21491570","21497290"," in the 70s The feds down near two percent now and it's not going to be cutting very very quickly"
"21497290","21503110"," So I think there are big differences in the concern about this return of inflation I mean it"

"21508730","21509430"," come back automatically. "
"21510190","21514290"," This is not the 1970s for a whole lot of reasons Yeah, not going to come back automatically just"
"21514290","21519370"," because the economy remains robust is the is the key point Um, right where you're looting to see"
"21519370","21521730"," we'll see you next week I look forward to that at steve lee'sman."

"21522590","21526770"," It's a kosher now of nb private wealth into the conversation So shan it's good to have you with us. "
"21526770","21527510"," You heard the professor."
"21527750","21532650"," He's still bullish eight to ten percent Maybe you could still do we've come a long way in a"
"21532650","21534770"," reasonably short period of time, but what's your own view here?"
"21536630","21541830"," Well, I think it's interesting because the professor talked a lot about this rotation if you will"
"21541830","21547350"," to the lagers that we Um that we've been talking about really since the fourth quarter of last year"
"21547910","21553250"," You know, I'm a bit uh less optimistic though if we're talking about growth stocks returning zero"
"21553250","21557830"," this year just from a benchmark Perspective that's not going to look and feel great for investors"
"21557830","21564330"," who Happened to be overweighted to the s&p 500 but under the surface I mean you think about what's"
"21564330","21568430"," happened so far this year scott We've seen a little bit of a tick up and yield since the end"
"21568430","21573350"," of the year We've seen some I would say softness or weakness in some of the interest rate sensitive"
"21573350","21579830"," sectors But those sectors are the ones that could potentially benefit from a more robust economic"
"21579830","21586090"," environment Of course, I agree with steves concern about top line There's been a lot it's been very"
"21586090","21591410"," easy to grow top line over the last couple of years given inflation However, that bottom line"
"21591410","21598150"," opportunity for a recapture is much more present in our view in some of these sectors that haven't"
"21598150","21603970"," Participated so to the professor's point do you see a rotation if we see some tech misses next week"
"21603970","21609010"," The the initial reaction is likely to be very negative to that And then I think there is probably a"
"21609010","21614330"," taking a step back looking elsewhere within the universe to see if there's perhaps opportunities"
"21614770","21622130"," Where that threat of multiple compression isn't so large professor Do you think we're late cycle or"
"21622130","21627170"," not because I find it hard to believe that you could think we are And then still think that growth"
"21627170","21632170"," stocks could return zero and that these cyclical plays are going to carry us To the gains you think"
"21632170","21636890"," we could do if we're at the end of the road Well, it's hard to know you know talk about"
"21636890","21641850"," late cycle because I you know, we just hit new highs Uh a couple weeks ago."
"21642090","21646850"," So some people say this is the start of a new bull market I would hate to think it's near"
"21646850","21649550"," the end Uh, but I do want to point out. "
"21649750","21657050"," I mean, uh, productivity has gone up and AI Promises productivity to go up and that does doesn't"
"21657050","21665230"," mean just the growth stocks AI is designed really to reduce costs to the the Smaller stocks that"
"21665230","21671150"," have lagged so far behind one thing is important You don't need a lot of earnings growth for a 12"
"21671150","21676910"," 13 p.e. Stock to give you a great return for a 30 p.e. Stock You have to keep"

"21683410","21689650"," who even suggested that These glp1 drugs these weight loss drugs are going to continue to increase"
"21689650","21694970"," productivity and continue to increase employee retention And that's all going to be you know a"
"21694970","21700410"," stimulus for the economy as well that maybe we're not considering enough Well, and reducing health"
"21700410","21705590"," care, which of course in the United States has the highest proportion of costs of the OECD country"
"21705590","21710650"," So we can reduce that we can add productivity to so many other parts of the economy Well, you"
"21710650","21715850"," increase corporate profits too in that in that sense too if they're if they're Shelling out less"
"21715850","21718370"," for their for their overall health care costs, correct?"
"21718730","21719230"," Absolutely."
"21719690","21719910"," Absolutely."
"21720350","21726590"," Yeah, shan Um, we we've we've had these fits and starts with with some of these lagging areas of"
"21726590","21729890"," the market Would you buy those today?"
"21730430","21732770"," Or would you feel better ahead of earnings?"
"21732990","21737250"," Let's let's not forget megacap earnings going to talk be the talk of everything next week in terms"
"21737250","21745610"," of market positioning Which is a better buy right now laggards or the leaders Yeah, I still think"
"21745610","21750170"," there's opportunities to add to the laggards because scott if you look at We do have a little bit"
"21750170","21752930"," of a push here in terms of health care and financials. "
"21752950","21756230"," We've seen better performance They're certainly not performing from a sector perspective as"
"21756230","21760950"," strongly as technology and comm services have this thus far this year But you are seeing a little"
"21760950","21765510"," bit of life and maybe that's partially on glp one But we saw that last year in those names There's"
"21765510","21769450"," other parts of health care that are getting another look and so I think if you're looking to"
"21769450","21775590"," position ahead of Not necessarily whether it's march or may or whether it's three or four Um rate"
"21775590","21780790"," cuts I think you're looking to position ahead of what could be the next part of this cycle and"
"21780790","21786870"," whether we're late cycle or early cycle scott We have had several rolling cycles So I think in in"
"21786870","21790990"," thinking about it just from a rates perspective Going into some of these interest rate sensitive"
"21790990","21795770"," areas whether it's now or or lagging it or or lagging in over the course of the next couple weeks"
"21796390","21802210"," Most clients most investors most funds have Have exposure to the technology stocks that are"
"21802210","21806870"," reporting next week We could see some weakness that creates buying opportunities in those laggards"
"21806870","21810010"," But likely those are not going to be the big movers next week."
"21810190","21814030"," It's really going to be these big tech names Professor all laggards are not created equal."
"21814190","21814350"," Obviously. "
"21814670","21816750"," What's the best sector right now that you have your eye on?"
"21817430","21824150"," Well, you know, I I don't actually do individual sectors I like to do classes of stocks and above"
"21824150","21825390"," value and growth stocks."
"21825630","21832190"," Let me say It's impossible to tell in the short run a week a month a quarter But when you"
"21832190","21839610"," go through the data over the longer run especially Right now we have a 40 to 50 percent premium on"
"21839610","21848910"," p e ratios of growth Relative to value relative to its historical mean And that tells you you're"
"21848910","21855270"," set up well For long-term investing in exactly the stocks that we've been talking about those that"
"21855270","21859830"," have those lower p e ratios Professor, I always enjoy our conversations and the debate."

"21878170","21883610"," that forest Christina Yeah, well the theme for today much like Intel is underwhelming guidance this"
"21883610","21888590"," time also with kla Kla is a chip equipment firm and they post a weak guidance But the assured"
"21888590","21894330"," investors that a recovery was underway not everyone was convinced though That's why shares are down"
"21894330","21895010"," 6 percent. "
"21895190","21899030"," However Goldman Sachs was a little bit Which is why they're uh still maintaining a positive outlook"
"21899030","21903910"," searching gears shares of chip data storage firm western digital are down a little bit Are a little"
"21903910","21908870"," bit better down, you know, just under three percent on concerns why a weaker memory shipment"
"21908870","21914370"," specifically with nan I was just reading a mazuho note and they said the both thesis remains intact"
"21914370","21917870"," because the memory cycle Recovery is underway."
"21918230","21921070"," So they believe this is a buying opportunity specifically for western digital."

"22184270","22186570"," Did you come back today to say i was wrong?"
"22186570","22192810"," I may look I we talked about we were dead wrong in terms of the call into the quarter I"
"22192810","22197570"," don't must go and say i'm was 25 years doing it probably a top five worst call that we've had"
"22197570","22202710"," going into a quarter We thought as we talked about that they put the line the sand from margins"
"22203370","22208350"," Price cuts are mostly over and instead it was a circus show from a conference call They left the"
"22208350","22214830"," door open for price cuts didn't give guidance Must talk about the 25 in terms of the the ownership"
"22214830","22220430"," and the ai And it went off the rails and that's why we're here today Basically, you know looking at"
"22220430","22221510"," it and feeling okay now."
"22221690","22227090"," What's the step forward put out that top 10 list Which we believe could be an inflection point to"
"22227090","22233350"," how we ultimately get higher Are you reassessing essentially now everything about this company"
"22233350","22233890"," going forward?"
"22234250","22239870"," Look we took it off top picks list because in the near term from a catalyst perspective new smoke"
"22239870","22245170"," and mirror I mean, you don't have the catalyst where you could ultimately say this is going to"
"22245170","22251230"," outperform the next 30 is 60 days Now in terms of the long term thesis We were mean firmly bullish"
"22251230","22257130"," because it's my view and it goes back to similar netflix and 11 with the streaming You go back to"
"22257130","22262330"," jobs and it was seven with iphone We've been through so many different evolutions of companies I"
"22262330","22268990"," think view this more as an evolution Into the next phase with ai and i view the mass market"
"22268990","22275550"," vehicles sub 30 000 So we don't throw that out but no doubt in the near term I mean it's"
"22275550","22276990"," been a disaster this week."
"22277230","22278130"," I look at your rate. "
"22278270","22279430"," You still have an outperform, right?"
"22279570","22285870"," So you haven't you haven't taken that How do you fundamentally have an outperform at 1.2 trillion"
"22285870","22292890"," market cap And an outperform now that it's down to 581 billion It's almost been cut in half."
"22293190","22294950"," How do you still have an outperform on it?"
"22295070","22295770"," It's great question."
"22295990","22303030"," It's my view that Going forward the margin story this is it's going to drop So I view like when"
"22303030","22308090"," they cut cause you could actually start to get margin expansion 20 30 percent and all of a sudden"
"22308090","22314030"," five dollars burnings becomes eight to ten when you look out next two years Especially on ai. "
"22314210","22320810"," I mean our view here is this could be the best long term ai play out there And that's what"
"22320810","22325730"," we talk about I think it's ultimately going to form this some sort of holding structure from an ai"
"22325730","22331390"," perspective with optimist dude Joe and others that that must be the best ai play out there I mean"
"22331390","22333370"," what are you talking about it in terms of automakers?"
"22333730","22339250"," He's talking in total like again Microsoft so so I'm saying longer term From from an automotive and"
"22339250","22345850"," from where they could go with dojo and optimist you could argue that Longer term this is going to"
"22345850","22352370"," turn to much more of a broader company now as we've talked about the ai revolution Is led by the"
"22352370","22359270"," godfather of ai gents in a video microsoft everything we're seeing in tech For for tesla to to"
"22359270","22366310"," misevaluate that this will be an ai story This will be what I view is almost I'll call it an"
"22366310","22371150"," air pocket and it's more than an air pocket But I think we are going to see at one point"
"22371150","22376010"," two and a half three million vehicles per year and at that point Scott We look back at this."
"22376430","22382550"," This is more the opportunity of very bad bump in the road rather than the time that this is a"
"22382550","22385950"," structural You know what I'd say changed in the story."
"22386090","22390290"," Okay, so you mentioned your top 10 listen I'm obviously not going to to go through all of them. "
"22390510","22397310"," However You suggest that they should do a $10 billion share buyback Because they have roughly $30"
"22397310","22404230"," billion of cash on hand In the same token down the list you say that they should do an ai"
"22404230","22409570"," acquisition spree and an aggressive one Because they have $30 billion of cash to fund deals."
"22409730","22414350"," I mean, which is it you want them to Buy things or you want to do a buyback because you"
"22414350","22418510"," mentioned the same 30 billion in both cases And it's not mutually exclusive especially for coming"
"22418510","22424190"," and generating its cash But first and foremost you got to do a buyback I mean the the number one"
"22424190","22430450"," thing that you need here is You have to do a buyback because what I view is sort of their"
"22430450","22435930"," view of what the where the stock is The cash situation which really stopped them from buybacks in"
"22435930","22441050"," the past but no longer And you guys show confidence so as much as we could talk about the story"
"22441050","22450890"," You got it and say talk talk You are so bullish on Tesla"
"22450890","22459170"," here like our ourselves over the years It's because Evie auto that's just the first step too much"
"22459170","22463790"," broader ai strategy that I believe they're going to implement I think they're in a strong position"
"22463790","22464470"," to do that."
"22464570","22471320"," What about this 25% stuff that he keeps talking about You say he should get a new compact package"
"22473000","22478220"," After you get the Delaware legal issues Taking care of what are you alluding to so that so the new"
"22478220","22484500"," compact and now come out in the proxy And that's something that to really make sure musk is here"
"22484500","22489040"," for the net as CEO You think the board should give them 25% control So I don't believe that"
"22489040","22493400"," board should give them 25% what I believe is ultimately gonna happen It's not gonna be dual class"
"22493400","22500680"," or something in the compact I view it as a holding structure Where ai in terms of dojo optimus so"
"22500680","22506020"," add the ai Technology that they're developing must have some ownership structure of that holding"
"22506020","22512560"," with incentives and that Through incentives will ultimately get them to 25 But we do not believe"
"22512560","22517920"," that a dual class will be there or the compact is just going to get them 25 I appreciate you"
"22517920","22524400"," coming on After the call you made the other day and after what happened We referenced going in that"
"22524400","22531380"," the prior three times the day after Was ugly for the stock and we've seen a fourth and scott we're"
"22531380","22535860"," gonna be obviously all the good calls But when you make a mistake like here, you got to own it. "
