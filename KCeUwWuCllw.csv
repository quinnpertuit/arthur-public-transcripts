"KCeUwWuCllw","0","1560"," That's going to be one of the questions this week."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1560","5880"," Yeah, you know, earlier it said the big event is the Fed meeting on your graphic,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","5880","10320"," but is it a bigger event than getting the CPI number, which, I mean..."
"KCeUwWuCllw","10320","14520"," It's a big event, yes, because we get the projections for rates for next year,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","14520","17720"," which is going to be new and updated from their September thinking."
"KCeUwWuCllw","17720","19680"," We're going to get the tone from Powell."
"KCeUwWuCllw","19680","20640"," He sets the tone."
"KCeUwWuCllw","20640","25560"," Is he going to talk tough and try to reverse some of the looser financial conditions we've been seeing?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","25560","29840"," So I think it's important because he will also be able to react to CPI,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","29880","31720"," which is why we get a hot CPI number."
"KCeUwWuCllw","31720","33280"," The market is going to react to that."
"KCeUwWuCllw","33280","35160"," And the Fed might react to it, too."
"KCeUwWuCllw","35160","36160"," That's the thing."
"KCeUwWuCllw","36160","38680"," We got lower unemployment than expected."
"KCeUwWuCllw","38680","41560"," Right, 3.7% was a surprisingly good number."
"KCeUwWuCllw","41560","43360"," Wages were going strong."
"KCeUwWuCllw","43360","46840"," And then a firmer CPI could lead the Fed to talk a little bit tougher."
"KCeUwWuCllw","46840","49200"," That's one of the big risks this week, for sure."
"KCeUwWuCllw","49200","53520"," Fed meeting does come as the Dow and the S&P come off these fresh 52-week highs,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","53520","56000"," NASDAQ highest level since April of 22."
"KCeUwWuCllw","56000","59760"," All three major averages with this six-week win streak."
"KCeUwWuCllw","59760","61160"," Joining us on the news line today,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","61160","63800"," Warden School, the professor of finance, Jeremy Seagulls with us."
"KCeUwWuCllw","63800","65560"," Professor, it's great to talk to you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","65560","68400"," I was struck by the, nope, that's not the professor,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","68400","70120"," but we'll get to that in a second."
"KCeUwWuCllw","70120","77120"," This journal piece over the weekend said the Fed can't put off prepping for rate cuts,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","77120","82280"," because if you got productivity at four and wages, sorry, productivity at two,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","82280","85200"," wages at four, that kind of puts you near target."
"KCeUwWuCllw","85200","87600"," Yeah, absolutely."
"KCeUwWuCllw","87600","93360"," And I heard Roger Ferguson, who I respect a lot on the six o'clock hour."
"KCeUwWuCllw","93360","96360"," And he said, oh, that could be a problem for percent wages."
"KCeUwWuCllw","96360","100800"," But four percent wages is absolutely not a problem when you have two, three percent."
"KCeUwWuCllw","100800","105520"," And actually you had over five percent productivity growth there in the third quarter."
"KCeUwWuCllw","105520","110360"," So, yeah, the unit labor costs have been going down."
"KCeUwWuCllw","110360","113840"," So that should not be a problem for the Fed."
"KCeUwWuCllw","113840","119040"," And I absolutely do advocate that they start thinking about lowering it."
"KCeUwWuCllw","119040","122120"," I don't think I'm going to do it on January 30th, certainly."
"KCeUwWuCllw","122120","128400"," But, you know, they should think about uninverting the yield curve in their March meeting."
"KCeUwWuCllw","128400","133800"," What are the, why do you think, to what degree are the markets jitters about either a warm CPI"
"KCeUwWuCllw","133800","138760"," or pushback from Powell, are they justified to any degree this week?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","138760","142680"," Yeah, I mean, honestly, I think the dot plots are going to be hawkish."
"KCeUwWuCllw","142680","145960"," And I don't think they're going to be right."
"KCeUwWuCllw","145960","151080"," I think they're going to be dual-occupancy, but that could unsettle the market."
"KCeUwWuCllw","151080","154320"," Yeah, we will have to see CPI and DPI."
"KCeUwWuCllw","154320","157160"," Now, by the way, they've already submitted their dot plot."
"KCeUwWuCllw","157160","159320"," So nothing that happens tomorrow."
"KCeUwWuCllw","159320","162440"," When they're going to change the dot plot, they are not going to move."
"KCeUwWuCllw","162440","164440"," That's not going to change either."
"KCeUwWuCllw","164440","170720"," But you were right in talking, you know, a while back, it definitely would change the tone"
"KCeUwWuCllw","170760","175560"," of the news conference on Wednesday that, you know, the Powell does,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","175560","178560"," depending on what those two factors are."
"KCeUwWuCllw","178560","183040"," And by the way, he has covered the fact that the unemployment rate moved away from that"
"KCeUwWuCllw","183040","186520"," 4%, which I think would have been politically not the good thing."
"KCeUwWuCllw","186520","193800"," Down to 3.7 gives a more political cover and a way to be hawkish because unemployment"
"KCeUwWuCllw","193800","198800"," is still under that 4% level, which is, quote, politically acceptable."
"KCeUwWuCllw","198880","203600"," Speaking of politics, I've heard in a lot of, you know, cocktail conversations,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","203600","206760"," well, Powell's going to cut rates more and he's going to do it faster next year"
"KCeUwWuCllw","206760","209720"," because he doesn't want Trump to get elected again."
"KCeUwWuCllw","209720","212400"," I know that the Fed is very apolitical."
"KCeUwWuCllw","212400","214000"," They would never do anything like that."
"KCeUwWuCllw","214000","219760"," But there is an election and an election economy to be considered of whether you're"
"KCeUwWuCllw","219760","221320"," going to try it to Fed policy or not."
"KCeUwWuCllw","221320","224520"," And I do wonder how that's going to impact the markets next year."
"KCeUwWuCllw","224520","231520"," The Fed is a creature of Congress, created by the Federal Reserve Act."
"KCeUwWuCllw","231520","236520"," Congress can take away any of the powers of the Fed it wants to."
"KCeUwWuCllw","236520","239520"," And so, you know, they've got to be conscious."
"KCeUwWuCllw","239520","243520"," And truth be known, don't forget they still have a dual mandate."
"KCeUwWuCllw","243520","245520"," It's not just inflation."
"KCeUwWuCllw","245520","248520"," It is inflation and employment."
"KCeUwWuCllw","248520","252520"," So it isn't like he's abdicating all his responsibility."
"KCeUwWuCllw","253520","258520"," And when we take a look at commodity prices, as you mentioned earlier, going down,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","258520","264520"," I guess it's going to be some stubborn parts of inflation and core inflation that are going to continue."
"KCeUwWuCllw","264520","267520"," But, you know, if you'd ask the American public, what would you rather have, you know,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","267520","272520"," 1% left on the core over the next year or another half a million million people unemployed,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","272520","274520"," you know, I think the choice is clear."
"KCeUwWuCllw","274520","277520"," And I think he has to recognize what that choice is."
"KCeUwWuCllw","277520","281520"," So you think the market, which is now expecting 100 basis points of cuts,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","281520","288520"," no matter what the Fed forecasts in its dot plot this week, is more correct?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","288520","289520"," Well, take a look."
"KCeUwWuCllw","289520","297520"," You know, 12 weeks ago in September, a majority of the FOMC said we're going to have another race by December,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","297520","298520"," by this week."
"KCeUwWuCllw","298520","300520"," And now that was wrong."
"KCeUwWuCllw","300520","302520"," And that was just three months ago."
"KCeUwWuCllw","302520","307520"," So, you know, we're all going to take a look and shudder at, oh, my God,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","307520","310520"," they're only predicting two cuts or one part or three cuts."
"KCeUwWuCllw","310520","315520"," But the truth of the matter is, you know, do you think they're going to get it right over 12 months"
"KCeUwWuCllw","315520","319520"," when they got so wrong over the last three months?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","319520","322520"," You know, I want to talk to you about something away from the markets."
"KCeUwWuCllw","322520","327520"," But since you're at Wharton, the Liz McGill resignation, the Penn president,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","327520","331520"," which developed over the weekend, I'm curious what your reaction is to it,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","331520","333520"," which is the chair of the board stepping down."
"KCeUwWuCllw","333520","334520"," Yeah."
"KCeUwWuCllw","334520","338520"," I mean, I really, you know, I was very upset by the response."
"KCeUwWuCllw","338520","340520"," I think everyone was."
"KCeUwWuCllw","340520","342520"," I mean, it was more than tone death."
"KCeUwWuCllw","342520","347520"," I mean, she was given several chances to say genocide is unacceptable."
"KCeUwWuCllw","347520","348520"," I'm not in contact."
"KCeUwWuCllw","348520","353520"," And, you know, when you say that, I see no way to survive."
"KCeUwWuCllw","353520","355520"," You have to go on."
"KCeUwWuCllw","355520","359520"," I'm not going to speak to Harvard, you know, I'm not at Harvard or MIT."
"KCeUwWuCllw","359520","364520"," But it is a problem that has been encroaching the good,"
"KCeUwWuCllw","364520","366520"," elite universities for a long time."
"KCeUwWuCllw","366520","369520"," And, you know, I think they've been called on it."
"KCeUwWuCllw","369520","371520"," You think something deeper is broken?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","371520","374520"," I mean, it's a step to see her resigning."
"KCeUwWuCllw","374520","376520"," But I'm curious."
"KCeUwWuCllw","376520","385520"," I think the problem has gotten a lot worse over the last, you know, five, ten years."
"KCeUwWuCllw","386520","389520"," There is certain speech that's politically acceptable."
"KCeUwWuCllw","389520","391520"," Other speech that is not."
"KCeUwWuCllw","391520","398520"," And they don't, you know, you have to have a consistent policy on it."
"KCeUwWuCllw","398520","405520"," And, you know, maybe this will jolt the universities back into what they should have always been doing."
"KCeUwWuCllw","405520","407520"," I hope so, in any case."
"KCeUwWuCllw","407520","409520"," Professor Siegel, it's David."
"KCeUwWuCllw","409520","411520"," Do you see a change in the classroom?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","411520","414520"," Do you think twice before you say certain things or no?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","415520","418520"," I retired from active teaching two years ago."
"KCeUwWuCllw","418520","421520"," So I still do special programs at Penn."
"KCeUwWuCllw","421520","426520"," But, you know, I have not seen any changes in the classroom."
"KCeUwWuCllw","426520","439520"," But, and particularly, warden was not as affected as the other parts of the university in terms of, you know, what you could say, what you could not say."
"KCeUwWuCllw","440520","447520"," How we felt it was a little bit freer than perhaps other divisions of the university."
"KCeUwWuCllw","447520","451520"," Professor, I appreciate you entertaining those questions with a thoughtful response."
"KCeUwWuCllw","451520","453520"," Definitely a big topic of discussion over the weekend."
"KCeUwWuCllw","453520","454520"," We'll talk soon."
"KCeUwWuCllw","454520","455520"," Jeremy Siegel."
"KCeUwWuCllw","455520","456520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","456520","459520"," As we had to break our roadmap for the rest of the hour."
"KCeUwWuCllw","459520","464520"," Yield's pushing back higher today, what the bond market is expecting from the Fed, inflation, and rates."
"KCeUwWuCllw","465520","467520"," Plus big farmers fight against fraud."
"KCeUwWuCllw","467520","469520"," The big money that's involved and who's at risk."
"KCeUwWuCllw","469520","470520"," Got some details this hour."
"KCeUwWuCllw","470520","474520"," And after the break, an exclusive that you're not the one to want to miss."
"KCeUwWuCllw","474520","479520"," Delta CEO at Bastion will join us live from the Hope Global Forum in Atlanta."
"KCeUwWuCllw","479520","483520"," We have a lot more squawk on the street for you straight ahead."
"KCeUwWuCllw","494520","496520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","524520","526520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","554520","555520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","584520","586520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","614520","638520"," Welcome back to squawk on the street."
"KCeUwWuCllw","638520","643520"," Let's get to Frank Holland this morning at the Hope Global Forum in Atlanta with a very special guest this hour."
"KCeUwWuCllw","643520","644520"," Morning, Frank."
"KCeUwWuCllw","644520","645520"," Good morning."
"KCeUwWuCllw","645520","646520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","646520","653520"," At the Hope Global Forum, the annual event for Operation Hope, a big event for financial literacy and financial wellness."
"KCeUwWuCllw","653520","656520"," And I'm joined by Delta CEO Ed Bastion, who's here to take part."
"KCeUwWuCllw","656520","661520"," You're going to be doing a panel in just a short time with John Hope Bryant to talk about Delta's programs."
"KCeUwWuCllw","661520","663520"," Thank you so much for being here with us."
"KCeUwWuCllw","663520","664520"," Great to be with you, Frank."
"KCeUwWuCllw","664520","666520"," And thank you for your support to Operation Hope."
"KCeUwWuCllw","666520","667520"," It means a lot."
"KCeUwWuCllw","668520","673520"," I want to talk about your support for Operation Hope and also what you're doing to support your employees."
"KCeUwWuCllw","673520","678520"," You're launching a new financial wellness program for your employees where employees can actually be given."
"KCeUwWuCllw","678520","682520"," They can earn $1,000 if they go through one financial wellness track."
"KCeUwWuCllw","682520","685520"," Explain what you're doing and why you decided to do."
"KCeUwWuCllw","685520","692520"," Well, one of the things that we learned about the world during the pandemic is our focus on wellness was never more important."
"KCeUwWuCllw","692520","698520"," And we want to make certain as we're coming out of the pandemic that we're taking the very best care, not just of our employees' physical health."
"KCeUwWuCllw","698520","704520"," Their emotional well-being, their social well-being, and of course their financial security."
"KCeUwWuCllw","704520","710520"," And the issues around financial insecurity kind of sit at the foundation of a lot of other issues as well."
"KCeUwWuCllw","710520","718520"," And there were a couple of stats that are prevalent out there in terms of the lack of Americans who have the ability to handle a financial emergency."
"KCeUwWuCllw","718520","725520"," One in four Americans do not have any capability to handle any kind of emergency on a financial standpoint."
"KCeUwWuCllw","725520","734520"," And over 57% of Americans do not have $1,000 that they could put their hands on in the time of the emergency at this point in time."
"KCeUwWuCllw","734520","739520"," And when I saw those stats a couple of years ago, I talked to John and we said we need to do something about this."
"KCeUwWuCllw","739520","744520"," I want to make certain that none of our 100,000 employees of Delta are in that condition."
"KCeUwWuCllw","744520","751520"," And so we've instituted this financial wellness program that we're going to be unveiling the first year results that we've seen."
"KCeUwWuCllw","751520","757520"," We launched at the beginning of the year, we've had over 30,000 of our people have signed up for it."
"KCeUwWuCllw","757520","765520"," If you sign up, you take the financial training for financial literacy, you sign up and you finish a track with a coach."
"KCeUwWuCllw","765520","772520"," You get $1,000 put in your name, no strings attached to handle any financial emergency that you want."
"KCeUwWuCllw","772520","775520"," And over 20,000 of our people have already concluded that."
"KCeUwWuCllw","775520","781520"," So Delta, obviously part of Operation Hope's financial literacy for all program and you're a proud member of that."
"KCeUwWuCllw","781520","785520"," I want to talk about your business now. We're in the holiday season right now."
"KCeUwWuCllw","785520","787520"," Give us a sense. What are you seeing when it comes to holiday travel?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","787520","792520"," What do you expect as we get closer to the end of the year where obviously we have Christmas and a lot of New Year's travel?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","792520","800520"," Well, as many people that were traveling during the fan Thanksgiving break saw that people are continuing to travel and the demand for travel keeps going."
"KCeUwWuCllw","800520","812520"," We saw more travelers during this Thanksgiving break that we've seen in our history, not just Thanksgiving for any week of holiday peak travel."
"KCeUwWuCllw","812520","818520"," We broke the TSA pre-COVID level of marks. The operational performance of the airline was amazing."
"KCeUwWuCllw","818520","824520"," For the 10 day period around the holiday, we had 50,000 operations that we launched."
"KCeUwWuCllw","824520","832520"," We had less than 20 cancels over 90% on time arrival and that demand has kind of now getting a set for a Christmas break."
"KCeUwWuCllw","832520","834520"," I think it's going to be equally as long."
"KCeUwWuCllw","834520","837520"," You also recently reaffirmed your full year guidance."
"KCeUwWuCllw","837520","840520"," One part of reaffirming the guidance was talking about business travel."
"KCeUwWuCllw","840520","843520"," What do you see? What do you see when it comes to business travel?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","843520","849520"," Of course, we have the pandemic where ground nearly to a halt and we've also had the rise of hybrid work and zoom and things like that."
"KCeUwWuCllw","849520","852520"," As we look into 2024, what's the state of business travel?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","852520","859520"," Well, managed business travel, which is the traditional business travel continues to improve and post the Thanksgiving break."
"KCeUwWuCllw","859520","862520"," We saw another step up, maybe another incremental 5%."
"KCeUwWuCllw","862520","865520"," So the volumes continue to work their way back."
"KCeUwWuCllw","865520","870520"," We're probably somewhere about 20% below where we were pre-COVID levels on managed business."
"KCeUwWuCllw","870520","881520"," But the thing that people miss is that while people aren't traveling for managed business, they're traveling on their own at a much higher level because mobility has been at a premium."
"KCeUwWuCllw","881520","885520"," Because of hybrid opportunities to travel and work and bring your office with you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","885520","891520"," So in aggregate, my view is business is far above anything we ever saw pre-COVID."
"KCeUwWuCllw","891520","894520"," We're just managing and looking at it differently today."
"KCeUwWuCllw","894520","897520"," Let's also talk about international travel, a higher margin business for you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","897520","903520"," Over recent weeks, we've seen a lot of geopolitical tensions, whether it's the Israel Hamas war or other issues around the world."
"KCeUwWuCllw","903520","906520"," How was that impacting your international travel business?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","906520","908520"," Well, international had a great year."
"KCeUwWuCllw","908520","912520"," And I think coming up in 24, it's going to have another strong year."
"KCeUwWuCllw","912520","915520"," People had three years to plan their trips."
"KCeUwWuCllw","915520","927520"," And when they finally got the green light this year to go internationally, felt comfortable going, they went, of course, we're watching what's going on with Ukraine, what's going on in the Middle East, and the challenges that presents."
"KCeUwWuCllw","927520","930520"," People are relatively resilient, though, in terms of travelers."
"KCeUwWuCllw","930520","932520"," And so we're watching with a cautionary eye."
"KCeUwWuCllw","932520","934520"," We don't see any pullback."
"KCeUwWuCllw","934520","935520"," All right."
"KCeUwWuCllw","935520","936520"," Before we let you go, I do have to ask you about one thing."
"KCeUwWuCllw","936520","938520"," This is actually a personal question."
"KCeUwWuCllw","938520","939520"," Sky Miles."
"KCeUwWuCllw","939520","940520"," Yeah."
"KCeUwWuCllw","940520","941520"," A lot of changes."
"KCeUwWuCllw","941520","942520"," You made changes."
"KCeUwWuCllw","942520","943520"," You kind of changed them back."
"KCeUwWuCllw","943520","946520"," What kind of response are you getting for your Sky Miles program?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","946520","948520"," What feedback are you getting for your customers?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","948520","954520"," Well, we made changes, and then we modified the changes, and I think we're in a pretty good spot now."
"KCeUwWuCllw","954520","961520"," We have more premium customers than any airline in the world, and we've seen such a continued demand for our product."
"KCeUwWuCllw","962520","965520"," That's outstripped our capability to serve effectively."
"KCeUwWuCllw","965520","970520"," And if everyone is in line standing into the Sky Club, that means no one is effectively a premium."
"KCeUwWuCllw","970520","972520"," So we needed to make changes."
"KCeUwWuCllw","972520","974520"," I hated making some of those changes."
"KCeUwWuCllw","974520","975520"," Are you done?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","975520","976520"," We're done."
"KCeUwWuCllw","976520","977520"," We're done."
"KCeUwWuCllw","977520","981520"," This is going to be it for as long as I can tell, and we'll monitor it."
"KCeUwWuCllw","981520","988520"," And I think what we wanted to do is we wanted to enable our premium customers to have a premium experience on Delta, and that's our goal."
"KCeUwWuCllw","988520","989520"," We're continuing to build more."
"KCeUwWuCllw","989520","1000520"," More clubs coming, more premium seats coming, more premium lines for travelers to call into, but until we could get caught up on the supply side, we had to do something on the demand side."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1000520","1002520"," I think a lot of people want their status."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1002520","1005520"," At Bastion, those changes are very interesting."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1005520","1008520"," Carl, everybody back in the studio, toss it back over to you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1008520","1010520"," And I will take it, Frank."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1010520","1011520"," Thank you."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1011520","1013520"," And thanks to at Bastion as well."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1013520","1014520"," Let's go to a quick break here."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1014520","1018520"," But check out the biggest laggards thus far this morning."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1018520","1019520"," And what do we have?"
"KCeUwWuCllw","1019520","1020520"," Almost an hour of trading."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1020520","1021520"," Meta."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1021520","1022520"," Leading that."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1022520","1030520"," Of course, you can see Paramount as well, giving up a bit of the gains that it saw on Friday on those stories about conversations that we talked about this morning as well."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1030520","1031520"," Yes, they are conversing."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1031520","1033520"," No offers have been made."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1033520","1038520"," Next year certainly early in the year will seem to be crucial for the future of that company."
"KCeUwWuCllw","1038520","1039520"," We're back for this."
