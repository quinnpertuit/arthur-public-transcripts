"32980","65740"," the stream is public, and let's"
"65740","73140"," see if the last one came up, failed to post the tweet."
"75780","77360"," How do we fail to post the tweet?"
"77500","78160"," Hey, good morning everybody."
"78720","79240"," How are you all doing?"
"79500","80280"," You guys are finding me alright?"
"81820","86620"," Let's see if it says I failed to post the tweet. "
"87760","89460"," Four minutes ago, let's see."
"91340","92860"," It's in legit right now or no."
"101000","102880"," Okay, yeah, so this is working. "
"102880","103940"," You guys are coming in this morning."
"104620","105320"," Good morning everybody."
"107320","108400"," Let's see who we got here. "
"109840","110980"," Good morning, you three."
"111360","112740"," Good morning, your wife's boyfriend."
"112740","114320"," Good morning, Andy. "
"114460","114980"," Good morning, James."
"115380","115980"," Good morning, Eric."
"116360","119700"," Good morning, Dio, Ryan, Guacata. "
"120040","120460"," Good morning."
"120700","130760"," In light productions, Ben Godfrey, Danny, STT, Philip, Jafar, Paul, B.D., Chaz, baby,"
"131180","141420"," F1, or Fisted, Mihai, or Mai Hai, Alex, Eric, Euro, Boomer, Angie, Felgen,"
"141860","142500"," Omar, A."
"142500","143880"," Run, where we roam."
"144700","149800"," G Chen, Herment, Paul, Azul, Blue, baby, good morning. "
"151200","159080"," Good morning, Nicholas, Abdul, Mohasan, I suck at words, names sometimes."
"159080","163960"," But hey, it's good morning, Al, Rick, Alexa, good morning, how are you?"
"168440","172500"," Hello, four trader, good morning, Patrick."
"173120","173560"," How are y'all doing?"
"177120","178820"," I've got a really great cup of coffee this morning. "
"179540","180400"," Good morning, Johnny Five."
"182560","183260"," Yeah, I know."
"183720","185880"," Your wife's boyfriend, I got to say it every morning, right?"
"186720","187420"," Good morning, Joel. "
"188260","189000"," How's everybody doing?"
"189000","191140"," Morning, T-Crown."
"193720","194120"," Howdy."
"197680","201520"," So we had a nice little bounce this morning, right off 4.65. I was trying to get the live"
"201520","203100"," stream up for you guys to see that this morning. "
"204160","207560"," And I was just having some tech more, or we added more lights this morning."
"207820","211720"," So it's not as dark as yesterday, trying to get everything set up."
"211720","216380"," Yeah, let's get some bread this morning, and, and, wreak, kaval. "
"216760","217400"," Let's get some bread."
"218680","223000"," Low four trader, Lofa."
"224460","225540"," Good morning, Hemmett. "
"226280","228060"," Case, good morning, K-C, good morning."
"229740","230960"," Hutch has hood calls."
"231880","232480"," Yeah, good morning, Josh. "
"232960","234360"," Yeah, the hood calls are a good idea."
"235500","237180"," Matter of fact, I'm going to check right now."
"237420","242100"," You know, I keep failing buying hood calls for some reason. "
"243240","245080"," I think I just have to buy them naked or something."
"245320","245600"," I don't know."
"248380","250200"," We're at 14.80 on hood. "
"251060","253920"," So I guess my real question on hood is, what's the bottom?"
"256060","258060"," And when does it rip, right?"
"258920","263660"," So that was my question was, do you buy outside the money 10 cent calls every month?"
"264420","265380"," Until it rips."
"269080","270720"," I made a duck ton off our puts."
"271020","271200"," Yep. "
"271960","273940"," Yeah, the coffee is delicious this morning."
"275600","277620"," You have spy calls."
"277720","283980"," Yeah, so we definitely have a localized bottom this morning on spy. "
"284520","294850"," I do want you guys to see that the buy the dip number is 463.43. There"
"294850","296090"," are more sellers than buyers."
"296150","298630"," There are more put buyers this morning."
"299610","306370"," We are still in a salvage rip situation unless the Fed comes out. "
"306550","308310"," I wouldn't trust anything coming from the government."
"308950","310230"," I wouldn't trust the Senate."
"310470","311390"," I wouldn't trust the President. "
"312010","313090"," I guess to a point you could."
"313690","317250"," But in reality, who has the control is the Fed?"
"318750","320830"," Yeah, there should be a ton of volatility today."
"321250","322630"," Just so you guys know. "
"322630","324350"," We're in 70 point going to print."
"324950","325770"," 75p going to print."
"327350","330710"," Yeah, there's no floor on anything out there right now. "
"330770","331530"," What you guys all to?"
"331850","333870"," We'll rehash a little bit of yesterday."
"335190","339490"," But what you really need to know out there, if you're a trader, you only need to know a couple"
"339490","339810"," things."
"340570","346190"," And that is that when they said yesterday, you know, it's one thing to have. "
"352020","353840"," Tapering and rate increases."
"354640","356660"," And you know, there could be some added volatility."
"357000","361540"," If you were to increase rate increases, let's say you say we're going to do two or three. "
"361940","364140"," We're going to do four or five or something and saying like that, right?"
"364660","370340"," But the real problem, of course, is that the moment that you say we're also turning the spigot off,"
"370640","371720"," that's the issue."
"375540","376540"," Test levels on book map."
"376660","377420"," Yeah, we'll do look at Tesla. "
"378640","380900"," Yeah, it's definitely it's definitely a fake pump."
"381360","385920"," Just in case any of you don't know that this is a fake pump this morning."
"386940","389720"," And if you have the if you're along in anything. "
"390980","395560"," What I would say to you is take the opportunity to get out of whatever you're in."
"397040","400900"," And you know, at the end of the day yesterday, we said, do you grab lungs into the clothes and"
"400900","401540"," the answer is no."
"402960","404800"," No, you don't grab lungs into the clothes. "
"405780","408400"," If you're along this market, you get out of your lungs."
"411400","412120"," You just do."
"412440","412920"," You have to. "
"413160","418020"," And the reason that you have to is because unless they come in and say something different."
"418400","423340"," They have to come in and say, oops, by the way, we're going to keep the money at least flowing."
"423600","427440"," If they don't, if they don't keep the money flowing, this is sell the market. "
"429160","434020"," And there's nothing that the Senate can say or the President can say."
"434020","436000"," We know that you couldn't pass."
"436200","440240"," There's no way that you that you could pass when we were in the depths of COVID. "
"441180","443680"," Direct injections of cash into businesses."
"444800","449040"," And so even proposing that yesterday is absurd at this point."
"450040","452140"," Or even if you do it, let's say you did it, right?"
"452500","454980"," You'd have to have the Senate flip full Democrat. "
"455840","459560"," You wouldn't you couldn't do it until November right till the elections."
"465820","470860"," We talked at the end of the day yesterday as well that you should be looking for companies that did"
"470860","472840"," not participate in the sell off."
"473980","475780"," Or at least heavily, right?"
"476340","479820"," And you saw that in some companies yesterday saw that in Tesla Amazon. "
"480500","484500"," I was surprised that Tesla didn't sell off as much as it as it could have."
"485220","488340"," It means that it's not as speculative as it once was."
"489140","494080"," But if you are in anything long that doesn't actually produce something. "
"494500","496040"," So HUD produces something."
"496300","498520"," Whether we like what Robinhood does or not."
"499600","501660"," They still provide a service out there. "
"502220","503340"," They still have customers."
"503660","505020"," They still have money rolling in."
"505140","510660"," You can't be inside of companies right now that like a Rivian, let's say, right?"
"511539","512919"," That doesn't actually make vehicles. "
"513799","516500"," You can't be inside of any companies at this moment."
"516500","521400"," I would say that or long any companies right now that don't actually produce something."
"527600","529200"," No, do not buy the dip. "
"530240","532680"," Do not buy the dip."
"533760","540940"," I would say to you that if you're long that you are trying to get out of whatever happened"
"540940","541640"," yesterday, right?"
"544110","545610"," I don't care if we go to 480."
"546110","548370"," Unless someone comes, unless someone, have I missed something?"
"549970","556230"," Yeah, have I missed any kind of news out there where the Fed has come out and said, no, we're"
"556230","557590"," not turning the money supply off?"
"559230","561850"," If I've missed that news, yes, then buy the dip. "
"562430","567710"," But if you haven't heard that from anybody at this point, they already know, right?"
"567930","572190"," So they know what the market's thought process is."
"572870","574590"," And that is the money supply is being turned off."
"578120","581460"," Yeah, the house isn't as important. "
"581760","583100"," What's really important is the Senate."
"584500","591140"," And you've got a stock of someone late last night I was saying, you know, you've got Goldman Sachs"
"591140","592160"," and JPM, right?"
"593380","594860"," They back any candidate."
"595060","596360"," They don't care which candidate is the president. "
"596620","600320"," But in some respects, they do back an individual candidate."
"601640","604640"," And it's more for power and money and control of the stock market."
"607940","613480"," So to some extent, you've got opposing forces that want different people in power. "
"614960","615820"," Good morning, Quinn."
"618170","618970"," Good morning, everybody."
"619190","620590"," If you're just joining us, good morning. "
"623500","626860"," Yeah, you know, excuse me."
"627240","630800"," My throat is sore today from talking for five straight hours yesterday."
"632060","638880"," So I would not, this is the other thing too, is that Bullard, who is a famous bear, right?"
"641800","644260"," He could be very bullish, believe it or not. "
"645640","648280"," He's flipped bull at moments in this market."
"648640","652560"," And that might lend some volatility, but it wouldn't be shocking to hear him come out and say"
"652560","653240"," something bullish."
"655930","657630"," So you have to hear that from the Fed. "
"657770","658550"," You can't hear it from the Senate."
"658770","659670"," You can't hear it from the president."
"659810","662650"," You can't hear it from anyone else out there except for the Fed. "
"663830","669730"," The Fed either has to be or has to say one of two things, right?"
"669730","674430"," That not only are we tapering, not only are we raising rates, but we're cutting the money supply"
"674430","674790"," off."
"675270","678330"," Or we're going to bounce it back to the Senate or the president or whomever."
"680390","684810"," And if they don't say that today, later this afternoon, you know, it's all the market. "
"686190","687110"," That's what it is."
"690260","693440"," What would be considered to sell the rip for 70 plus?"
"693680","695360"," Well, we're watching it this morning, right?"
"695940","697720"," So we've got book map up right now."
"697720","704020"," But what's interesting, one of you guys to see is that there's no target above, right?"
"704320","704760"," Do you see this?"
"705440","707040"," This 4.79, 480. "
"708700","712080"," This 4.91, like these targets are gone."
"713540","714040"," Right?"
"714760","716020"," I just want you guys to see that."
"716320","717380"," But these targets are gone. "
"717580","722880"," There are no targets above in terms of where supply is to sell."
"723520","726040"," And so we're at 470 right now, right?"
"728850","731130"," And I should bring a chart up for you guys."
"736420","739420"," But I do want you to see that right now we are in..."
"739420","741000"," I don't know if I can bring this up here. "
"741620","748650"," But your sell the rip is right where we are."
"749850","750670"," Basically 470."
"751510","754150"," So 470 to 4.71 was that volatility zone. "
"754310","756430"," It was that combo support level from yesterday."
"756910","761270"," And that support level turns into a major resistance level at this point."
"762130","764730"," So we've flipped negative, right?"
"764810","766290"," We're in negative gamma now at this point. "
"767490","769150"," We're entering negative gamma."
"770010","772410"," And we're going to bounce off right here and probably sell down."
"776220","783180"," I think, or at least my take is to buy puts at this point, right where we are right now. "
"787150","788050"," And then we're heading down."
"791010","797070"," You know, we tagged off 465 this morning and the next level to be gutting for is 460."
"800200","802460"," Yeah, nobody cares about any of the news right now too. "
"802660","804220"," Forget the economic news that's out there."
"804640","805320"," It means nothing."
"805940","808880"," The only thing that matters right now is the money supply is being turned off. "
"810940","811800"," Yeah, Quinn's in here."
"814190","816130"," That's the only thing that really matters at this point."
"817010","818030"," I don't care what we trade to. "
"818170","818970"," I don't care if we trade higher."
"819850","820730"," It just doesn't matter."
"821430","823470"," We've got more buyers than sellers right now. "
"823470","825750"," We've got put buyers coming in as well at this point."
"831300","834300"," There's nothing you can say unless the Fed comes out and says something."
"834760","835980"," It's definitely sell the rip. "
"838660","841600"," That's where we are in the market, whether you know it or not."
"850120","853280"," Yeah, there's nothing that saves this market at this point."
"853620","856060"," The moment that the money supply is cut off, there's problems. "
"859540","862620"," Do any of you guys disagree with that out there?"
"862800","865020"," Anybody that's watching right now that disagrees with that?"
"865760","866980"," Maybe I don't know something."
"869780","872220"," Maybe I'm missing something possibly this morning."
"880320","883600"," You're talking about not just the rates, right?"
"883740","885240"," You got rates going to the roof. "
"887460","889280"," But the real problem is that the money flow."
"889700","890560"," There's no easy money."
"891000","893960"," And there's no easy money even on the back end for these companies. "
"901740","905740"," I think I even read the spot, Gamma Report, yet this morning, but it said something about..."
"905740","909740"," I read it briefly and it was talking about high volatility today."
"910600","911540"," And I don't expect the same."
"911540","915360"," You can't say that you're going to be in calls as the Fed is coming out at 1.30 this"
"915360","915660"," afternoon. "
"916140","917800"," We'll check and see which side everybody's on."
"917920","922100"," If everybody's on the put side, maybe you do buy the calls and we'll probably trade that at 1.30"
"922100","922540"," this afternoon."
"926110","928750"," Bob is saying that volatility never went up to the SKU side. "
"929250","930190"," SKU down this morning."
"930670","931610"," What is he saying?"
"932010","932730"," I'm missing some of this."
"936270","937590"," Yeah, he made it pretty clear yesterday. "
"939930","940950"," SKU down this morning."
"949300","951420"," Some folks are anticipating an announcement."
"953980","955640"," Yeah, no, I don't believe that. "
"955900","965050"," So I'm against the trade of the rotation into value and energy."
"965270","966130"," Well, sometimes energy."
"966530","974150"," If the market is going to burn, sometimes you'll see a rip in energy into a market downturn. "
"975550","977410"," So I can't say that that doesn't happen."
"977850","980010"," And you will see people flee to value."
"980010","985770"," But if you think that the flee, if you think if you flee, you know, fleeing the value is kind"
"985770","989090"," of like being on a sinking ship. "
"989810","992090"," And then you've got a lifeboat with a hole in it."
"993630","997930"," So you jump off the ship into the lifeboat and then the lifeboat sinks as well, right?"
"999330","1000650"," So how fast do you want to die?"
"1001190","1001670"," I don't know."
"1009350","1010930"," Yeah, we are a negative gamma now. "
"1011970","1017510"," I'm going to log in and check out what spot gamma said this morning and read what they have to"
"1017510","1017770"," say."
"1018370","1022080"," But we are a negative gamma."
"1022460","1023839"," Whether you know it or not, we are. "
"1030780","1031760"," We are underneath."
"1033099","1042050"," So if you're looking at the spy right now, the vault trigger was at 465."
"1046920","1048280"," We touched it this morning. "
"1048520","1049640"," I shouldn't say we're a negative gamma."
"1049760","1051040"," We're not quite a negative gamma."
"1054120","1063640"," But I guess we touched, we basically touched this morning between 466.35 and 465.06. And that was"
"1063640","1066400"," the basic volatility trigger. "
"1066580","1072580"," The moment that you are able to break through 465, you are in bear town."
"1073640","1074840"," That's like full on bear country."
"1077030","1079770"," That's the real sell the, sell the rip area. "
"1079770","1085730"," So if you guys have charts out there, pretty much a snap a couple lines at 465."
"1087890","1094770"," Yeah, basically 465 and 466.35. If you snap two lines right there."
"1095410","1106700"," And if there's a break below that level, and actually you can see it here, this 463.60. 462 "
"1106700","1109260",".87, you break through this right here and you're in bear town. "
"1109260","1113040"," And there's really nothing you can do at that point."
"1115200","1116820"," It's free falling, right?"
"1117020","1118780"," You can actually see it on the chart right here."
"1121920","1125340"," You know that JPM, we were talking about this too earlier in the week, right?"
"1126260","1134240"," Remember when the JPM caller came out and we were talking about it and everyone said, oh no, we're"
"1134240","1134860"," very bullish. "
"1135280","1143080"," And I was like, well, there's selling calls above, or basically 490 and above, there's some calls"
"1143080","1145520"," and their buying puts down to 400."
"1146460","1147940"," I think that's what it was, right?"
"1148500","1150260"," And it gives you a defined trading range."
"1150260","1158380"," And it also lends to the risk that's coming up in the months of January through March. "
"1167260","1168620"," So what does negative gamut mean?"
"1168720","1169520"," Let's talk about that briefly."
"1170040","1176220"," So if we sell down, and you can see right now, all you guys to see that, you see these"
"1176220","1178320"," sellers coming in above here at 470?"
"1178960","1181560"," Do you see right here with what's happening?"
"1182320","1192060"," So if you're a bull, you can see that you have sellers stepping in at this 470-70, 470 "
"1192060","1195100","-05, and they're going to try to sell this down right now, okay?"
"1195860","1204960"," And what the bears really want is they want to break below 463.47. Now, if you get a break"
"1204960","1206340"," below this area here, right?"
"1207260","1208760"," That's really the sell the rip."
"1210360","1217460"," Truth, you can't not say we're not selling the rip if we break below this level down here at 463. "
"1224720","1232460"," And we could buy up today, buy up to the Bullard Fed's speech at one o'clock, and you can"
"1232460","1240420"," have a positive outlook at this point to an extent, because I said that we're in negative gamut, we"
"1240420","1243620"," really are not until we break below 463."
"1244240","1248720"," We're in a volatility zone, if that makes any sense to any of you."
"1248980","1254960"," If you have positive gamma, you've got negative gamma, which are both bad terms. "
"1255620","1258560"," They're not really accurate terminology for what that means."
"1259820","1265100"," But for simplicity's sake, if you had positive gamma and negative gamma, right in the middle right"
"1265100","1267380"," there is a support zone."
"1267940","1269840"," And that support zone is 463. "
"1272300","1282440"," And if you break below that zone, well, it's actually 466, 33"
"1282440","1284740"," or so, and 463."
"1285160","1288400"," If you break through that zone, we got problems."
"1288800","1294160"," And you can see this little white area here, this is 465, 29. "
"1294160","1302220"," It's a little bit more truthful in what it is, but this zone right here is the flip to negative"
"1302220","1302520"," gamma."
"1304100","1309640"," But when you're in volatility, in between the positive and negative gamma, when you're in"
"1309640","1311620"," volatility, you can expect wild swings."
"1314040","1315940"," And so if you're a bull, you can't trade it. "
"1316300","1322220"," If you're a bear, at the top here, well, if you're a bull, I guess you can buy this down"
"1322220","1322420"," here."
"1322420","1324400"," And if you're a bear, you can buy this up here."
"1325600","1328020"," But this is not positive in any way shape or form. "
"1328140","1332380"," There's nothing about this that is, hey, I should buy this dip and hold it to 480."
"1338060","1339520"," Should we short our K?"
"1344140","1347000"," Wondering what dates I should be adding and rolling over my puts."
"1357630","1360270"," Squeeze metrics is showing massive negative gex. "
"1365000","1365940"," Is gold still a meme?"
"1367700","1369200"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"1371590","1375310"," Are there any relations between NDX, TGA, and the 10-year?"
"1380080","1382060"," Yeah, vol is cheap for your tail risks."
"1383260","1384500"," I love trading. "
"1385040","1388300"," Well, a bunch of you yesterday, we talked, what do we say last week?"
"1388440","1391800"," We said, buy some put spreads, right?"
"1391920","1393060"," We're at the top last week at 480."
"1394040","1396460"," We're like, buy some put spreads, date them out a month to three months."
"1397480","1398620"," That they're guaranteed to print. "
"1399580","1400600"," And they started printing yesterday."
"1403440","1407460"," They're printing this morning still to an extent or after the bell they printed as well."
"1408940","1412980"," And we're talking about where's the risk, right?"
"1413280","1415000"," So does anybody out there think we're going to 500?"
"1415540","1415760"," No. "
"1418240","1422000"," Does anybody think out there, whether you're a bull or a bear, do you think that that 400's on the"
"1422000","1422220"," table?"
"1423700","1427040"," So you need to be looking to sell the rip at some point."
"1431840","1434540"," And we're probably set up to sell the rip as well."
"1442770","1445090"," I'm going to position myself right now. "
"1445270","1445430"," Hold on."
"1463790","1469470"," The only other thing you could say to yourself was, well yesterday we traded the put side and the"
"1469470","1469850"," long side."
"1471070","1474490"," I closed the long side and held the puts and they ended up printing as well heavy. "
"1475290","1476490"," I didn't hold them long enough."
"1476810","1480010"," I guess they ended printing like five bucks or something."
"1480870","1482230"," And I sold it like three dollars. "
"1485220","1486140"," What's going on here?"
"1486980","1488340"," I need to log in."
"1488340","1506660"," The only"
"1506660","1509260"," issue that I have this morning is that puts are now very expensive."
"1510640","1513140"," And you'll hear commentary out there from people. "
"1514500","1519440"," They'll say to you that options become expensive because they're worth something."
"1520640","1526940"," And I agree once that flip happens, you are going to pay for your puts at this point."
"1527760","1528940"," Or at least today you will. "
"1540400","1542780"," And everybody's loaded up on 465Ps."
"1544320","1553320"," You've got 90,000 people or 90,000 contracts in 465Ps that expire on the seventh."
"1562090","1563690"," So 115 we've got fed. "
"1568400","1571040"," Yeah, they print the puts printed so heavy yesterday."
"1571040","1573280"," It was absolutely effing stupid."
"1579530","1586120"," Now, so next question to any of you out there is, do you take the opposite side of the trade"
"1586120","1588500"," today into the 115 hour?"
"1588680","1590020"," Do you take the call side?"
"1594930","1596430"," Or is it just a done deal?"
"1596930","1599730"," Does bullard come out and does he get real like uber bearish?"
"1601010","1605290"," And yesterday markets in mayhem posed a great question. "
"1606930","1614710"," And the question was, can you pivot from what the market did yesterday?"
"1616290","1618110"," Or do they not pivot?"
"1618610","1621510"," And is it too early to pivot from what was said yesterday?"
"1621510","1631410"," Yeah, I'll take a look at HUD."
"1631590","1633210"," I'll look at a bunch of stuff for you guys right now."
"1633210","1636010"," Let's do, we're going to do HUD and we'll do Tesla. "
"1641820","1644000"," And then we're going to play some day trades today."
"1645540","1648440"," We really want to do that position for days."
"1650000","1651480"," That's the plan every day, right?"
"1651720","1660880"," My one issue with HUD is, or that I'm concerned with, is"
"1660880","1665660"," does the trade become minutia?"
"1666440","1673540"," Where you don't have HUD moving from, let's say, $15 to $40. "
"1674000","1678940"," You only have HUD moving from, let's say, $15 to $20, or $15 to $16."
"1680260","1684140"," And that's a move at the other side."
"1684140","1688780"," That's a move at the other side. "
"1688860","1698120"," I do put your Tesla trader and your Tesla investor that you don't want to break $10.20. You didn't"
"1698120","1700100"," want to break $100 without a doubt."
"1722020","1725760"," So $11 was kind of a bull case."
"1727220","1729520"," You reach $11.00 and then you move higher. "
"1730320","1731940"," It's a bull case for Tesla."
"1731940","1740580"," If you break below $10.20, see this, see this zone down here on Tesla, this $10.20,"
"1740860","1744980"," this would be the negative gamma flip basically for Tesla."
"1746420","1748220"," So this is the do or die. "
"1748740","1758480"," I'll tell you guys out there that if you break, right here it's showing"
"1758480","1761200"," $10.22, $10.23 somewhere in there."
"1761200","1771130"," If you break that $10.20 level, then you're talking about, you will see no less than"
"1771130","1771610"," $900."
"1773010","1776110"," And that price target is, my price target is $750. "
"1776970","1778810"," I've been talking about that for some time now, right?"
"1779330","1783350"," So if you breach $10.20, last Friday we were talking into the close."
"1783710","1789190"," I said to you guys that Tesla was at a do or die moment in the market."
"1789190","1799310"," So if they don't break above $10.20 at this point that you're going to see $750, $900, There's"
"1799310","1801990"," a bounce this morning that's productive and it's good to see. "
"1803250","1808810"," And the only bull case that you have is above $1.100. And you can see it this morning, right?"
"1808950","1810730"," You've got the $1.100 mark above."
"1810990","1813310"," You can see the $10.20 below."
"1814110","1815990"," And what does this tell you about the market?"
"1815990","1819870"," It tells you that the market is waiting for a decision from the Fed. "
"1821430","1827970"," It tells you that we're in a holding pattern right now to get more information from the Fed."
"1831430","1837130"," So if you're bearish, you're going to look to short the market on a high up here."
"1837890","1840090"," Not just Tesla, I'm just talking the market in general. "
"1840870","1842830"," I'm going to be looking to short the market here."
"1844070","1849550"," If you think that Bullard is going to come out bullish or dovish, right?"
"1849730","1855430"," Dovish should be a better way than you're going to be looking to wait until he comes out and speaks"
"1855430","1857710"," and you're going to take it above $1.100 and move higher."
"1860560","1870540"," And actually Tesla's probably a good, I'm kind of shocked to say this, but Tesla's"
"1870540","1874800"," probably going to be a good indicator for where the market heads today. "
"1875920","1884600"," So if you see a break above this $1.100 or if you see a break below $10.20, that's"
"1884600","1887560"," going to give you a good idea of where we're headed."
"1891960","1894800"," Because these are the only two contexts that really matter for Tesla, right?"
"1895440","1899900"," Above $1.100 below $10.20. Below $10.20, you're selling everything."
"1900720","1903520"," Above $1.100, we're bullish to get on Tesla. "
"1909480","1910680"," Is it getting choppy?"
"1910680","1912580"," My audio's getting choppy."
"1912880","1924920"," A three"
"1924920","1925400"," minute lag."
"1930430","1931750"," Let's take a look and see what's up. "
"1951790","1952670"," Check one two."
"1953170","1954070"," Check one two."
"1957450","1961130"," Should I reset this live stream and see if we can get a better stream?"
"1966180","1970220"," I wonder if I have an update maybe in my computer that's slowing us down here. "
"1971700","1973640"," I need to restart the entire thing."
"1976720","1977560"," Let me know right now."
"1977720","1979560"," Do I have a choppy stream still?"
"1986590","1987550"," It's okay now. "
"1987790","1987950"," All right."
"1990190","1992050"," I might have to restart my computer."
"1992290","1996990"," I had a notification yesterday that asked if I wanted to install updates. "
"1997650","2000190"," So I'm wondering if I didn't do that."
"2000290","2002990"," Maybe I might have forgotten to restart my computer."
"2017540","2019020"," Because we can restart the stream as well. "
"2027280","2030000"," You guys want me to rehash what Spot Gamma had to say about today?"
"2039240","2040300"," Everything is all right now."
"2041280","2043880"," Yeah, so you guys got what I had to say about Tesla."
"2048770","2051830"," You couldn't say this about Tesla in the past either. "
"2052409","2056150"," So Tesla in the past traded was difficult to trade."
"2057170","2059330"," You could see Tesla go down."
"2059969","2063070"," You could see that you could short small caps and Tesla would go down. "
"2063810","2069389"," Then Tesla joined the S&P 500 and you would see the S&P 500 go up and Tesla go"
"2069389","2069630"," down."
"2070670","2078110"," But more recently, I would say the past six months or so it's tracked better with the S&P 500."
"2083440","2084179"," It's good now. "
"2085219","2086560"," All right, good job."
"2093690","2097120"," Ooh, can you open them up?"
"2098780","2099680"," What do we got there?"
"2111640","2112740"," Ooh, let's see that one."
"2116850","2118030"," What do we have here?"
"2137720","2141360"," Yeah, these are all the books that I've read for free. "
"2142400","2145240"," And I want the actual physical copies of."
"2145860","2146480"," All right."
"2151370","2153230"," And you guys know what this book is right here?"
"2156810","2159210"," This book is called The Wisdom of Crowds. "
"2160350","2166710"," So most of these books I've read on like an audio bar I've listened to in audio books but I"
"2166710","2167970"," don't own the physical copies of."
"2169310","2171090"," Wisdom of Crowds, great book."
"2175640","2177320"," This is a really good book right here. "
"2178720","2179700"," Against the gods."
"2180400","2181700"," Have any guys read this book?"
"2184270","2185410"," You guys know this book?"
"2185650","2186210"," Against the gods?"
"2191610","2193490"," The new market wizards?"
"2194470","2195910"," Any guys like that book?"
"2201400","2204000"," Oh, I want some dry reading."
"2204440","2205080"," You want a textbook?"
"2207120","2209100"," Financial markets and institutions?"
"2210460","2214440"," I bet if you had a loved one at home you could read this one to them and they'd fall"
"2214440","2214960"," right asleep. "
"2220210","2221330"," Ugh, gross."
"2223890","2227490"," All the finance bros have read this book."
"2242530","2243910"," I thought it was snacks. "
"2248520","2249820"," Do you guys read books?"
"2264070","2267070"," Tesla's trading up right now to the 1076 level."
"2268150","2269650"," There's some minor resistance."
"2272170","2275330"," I'd be careful of Tesla this morning. "
"2276430","2285950"," If you're going to take that trade or if you're in that trade on Tesla, be careful around the 1100"
"2285950","2287030"," number."
"2287810","2290290"," You've got some volatility here."
"2294660","2296080"," Yep, that's right. "
"2301040","2302880"," Yeah, Wisdom of Crowds is a great book."
"2304220","2305640"," I've got this one too, right?"
"2306200","2306660"," Hold on."
"2315180","2319640"," Frequently asked questions and quantitative finance quantitative. "
"2320200","2322840"," If you guys say quantitative or do you guys say quantitative?"
"2323780","2325040"," Frequently asked questions."
"2325680","2327800"," If you guys want me to read some of this to you."
"2331180","2332960"," Oh, Ryan, I remember that one. "
"2346260","2347220"," Dry reading."
"2353740","2355520"," Tesla's going to bang to 1100."
"2356380","2359360"," Yeah, well, no, you've got some resistance at 1080. "
"2359800","2361280"," You might creep up to 1100."
"2364730","2366310"," You guys want to see IWM."
"2366310","2369930"," So basically your resistance is 1080 and 1100 on Tesla. "
"2379710","2388350"," I do want to warn you that if there was an index that is basically pinned, it's IWM."
"2393380","2396400"," It's the scariest of all three indexes at this point or four."
"2398200","2399220"," Can't keep up. "
"2399500","2409540"," Can't knock down the DJ or DJ IA, the"
"2409540","2410240"," old man index."
"2422240","2424520"," So you've got 206 over here."
"2432690","2435890"," You've got more buyers than sellers on IWM. "
"2443540","2444700"," What is a book?"
"2451070","2452270"," The newest one."
"2457970","2458950"," Nice, Steve."
"2465740","2468240"," I'll make it sound better if I read it. "
"2474350","2475130"," Book nerds."
"2475750","2476310"," You know what I should do?"
"2476610","2478970"," Yeah, I should do a late night live stream."
"2481610","2486870"," Come on at like 11 p.m. or 1 a.m. and just read books to you guys. "
"2490280","2492740"," Read like the New Market Wizards."
"2494560","2504390"," The New Market Wizards as"
"2504390","2506010"," read by Captain Jim James."
"2508170","2509310"," Here's what I believe. "
"2510290","2511970"," The markets are not random."
"2516550","2525410"," You're getting some clipping."
"2526090","2526390"," Okay. "
"2528190","2529950"," I think I have to reset my computer."
"2530850","2534790"," If you guys want me to reset and send out a new live stream I can."
"2541390","2544430"," Not financial advice, but Arc puts are pretty juicy here. "
"2545050","2547230"," So I think there is a bottom to Arc."
"2547430","2549770"," I think it's around $65 somewhere in there."
"2552030","2554410"," Doug saying, or do a boy saying that Vix is coming back. "
"2554410","2563240"," You guys want to see the keys real quick?"
"2564860","2566600"," I don't trust IBM at all."
"2567460","2569620"," IBM is not showing anything this morning."
"2575210","2577050"," And it shouldn't really be showing anything this morning. "
"2577210","2577510"," It's pinned."
"2578110","2580950"," There's millions of dollars in IWM puts out there."
"2582150","2585970"," Spot camera this morning said that they didn't see any significant hedging in the markets. "
"2586710","2588270"," I disagree with their summation."
"2589130","2592670"," I watched major hedging yesterday on IWM."
"2593590","2595290"," I disagree with what they're saying completely. "
"2598300","2598920"," It's funny."
"2599140","2599680"," I trade often."
"2600540","2605000"," So I use spot cameras one of my basis points for the market. "
"2606020","2608500"," But sometimes I don't agree with spot camera."
"2608940","2610760"," And this morning I don't at all."
"2611580","2614020"," When it comes to I was their major. "
"2614220","2617480"," I think they wrote that there wasn't major hedging put in the market."
"2617860","2618800"," But all the puts are short."
"2623920","2624420"," What?"
"2624420","2625500"," Hold on a second. "
"2627120","2627960"," Books and beverages."
"2628460","2630200"," This is hilarious."
"2632790","2634410"," I got a bunch of questions here, right?"
"2635630","2636670"," Vix is coming. "
"2638110","2640910"," How can you tell IWM is pinned?"
"2641550","2649150"," Okay, so if you guys check yesterday, there's nice support here at 380 on the QQs."
"2649290","2649750"," Let's start here."
"2650430","2652370"," So the queues, there's great support down here at 380. "
"2653770","2660530"," You've got more buyers down below at 374.95. There's no more ceiling on."
"2660810","2665190"," Remember, remember before we had a ceiling on the Qs?"
"2665530","2666910"," And we don't right now, right?"
"2667170","2668130"," So there's no calls above."
"2668410","2670890"," Everyone's trying to buy puts and send it lower than 380. "
"2671530","2674290"," That would be the gamma flip for NQ."
"2674810","2675770"," If you guys want to know."
"2676830","2679690"," And if you guys want to know about why IWM is pinned. "
"2681350","2686650"," No matter what anyone's telling you out there, there was major hedging put on IWM yesterday."
"2687410","2688290"," So that's the facts."
"2690570","2693030"," Now, that hedging was short dated. "
"2693430","2694450"," I think it was into February."
"2695150","2695890"," I'll check right now."
"2695970","2699570"," Let's look at it right now so that I can tell you guys where the hedge is. "
"2700050","2701570"," What the hedge is on IWM."
"2712820","2713420"," It's weird, too."
"2713580","2715520"," I think, or seven or whatever his name is. "
"2715560","2716680"," I forget how pronounce his name anymore."
"2717740","2719920"," I know he's got a special way to pronounce his name."
"2720100","2722400"," It's like, it's not Sam. "
"2722660","2725800"," It's like CHEM or CHAME or something like that."
"2725940","2726220"," I don't know."
"2726620","2732360"," But he blocked me a long time ago because we disagree often. "
"2733720","2742790"," And this would be another morning that we disagree."
"2745690","2751300"," So there was February 18th."
"2751620","2755300"," There was a hedge put on IWM yesterday at 208. "
"2755300","2755600"," 208."
"2757180","2757640"," 208."
"2758540","2759000"," P."
"2760000","2762120"," And you can say whatever you want, but it's on. "
"2762300","2765620"," Unless it's been removed, they can check to see if it's been cashed out."
"2803710","2806970"," Yeah, it could have been cashed out yesterday or today."
"2806970","2808190"," Could be gone this morning. "
"2808510","2814490"," There was yesterday, there was puts put on IWM."
"2816370","2821330"," Three, four, five, six, six or seven million dollars in puts."
"2821330","2830420"," Plus another 4.3 million, 10 million dollars in February 18th"
"2830420","2837840"," on 210 and in 208. "
"2839980","2847380"," And there's significant puts on February 18th, 213 P as well."
"2856340","2861020"," And there's significant puts on February 18th, 220 P as well."
"2861020","2870920"," So anyone telling you that IWM is not hedged as lying straight up"
"2870920","2871820"," or doesn't know. "
"2879730","2881470"," Unless those aren't on anymore."
"2881690","2883430"," Maybe they're not on anymore, maybe they cashed them out."
"2883870","2885690"," Does anybody out there, can you guys see if?"
"2889780","2892700"," Yeah, there's still 31,000 OI. "
"2897100","2898980"," Yeah, it's Gem or something or Gem."
"2899860","2900640"," Is it Gem?"
"2901020","2901460"," I always forget."
"2901800","2902800"," Yeah, the croissant guy. "
"2902960","2905900"," I always forget how to pronounce his name."
"2907240","2908420"," And I like what he does."
"2908800","2909620"," I like everything he does. "
"2909740","2910740"," I like what he offers."
"2911020","2914480"," I love spot gamma, but I don't always agree."
"2917010","2919730"," I think spot gamma called it wrong yesterday too, right?"
"2920010","2926320"," So spot gamma's daily or whatever. "
"2926660","2927340"," It's not a daily brief."
"2927520","2928240"," I forget what they call it."
"2929400","2931420"," There are daily notes for wrong yesterday. "
"2931680","2933260"," So, you know, they don't get everything right."
"2933420","2934460"," Well, nobody gets anything right."
"2934580","2935640"," I don't always get shit right either. "
"2935720","2936940"," I get things wrong all the time."
"2936940","2944730"," Every district has made the stuff that people can't comprehend."
"2945350","2946430"," Yeah, Gem or something. "
"2946650","2948530"," It's called, he pronounces his name like that."
"2951380","2954880"," So, Gem."
"2955220","2956260"," That's what they pronounce it. "
"2956460","2956560"," Gem."
"2959250","2960110"," That's how you pronounce it."
"2960510","2960650"," Gem. "
"2964990","2970470"," A bunch of Apple calls coming in January 7th, 177."
"2971030","2971550"," Fives."
"2972550","2975990"," Uber calls coming in January 7th, 44C. "
"2980100","2981100"," Oxy calls coming in."
"2981820","2986100"," O-X-Y, 31C on January 21st."
"2990120","2992040"," You guys see this nice top up here, right?"
"2992300","2992440"," 470. "
"2993080","2993700"," Bounce, blower."
"2995080","2998840"," If I had to guess, we're waiting for the Fed announcement today at one o'clock."
"3008700","3010820"," These are not sold. "
"3011120","3012720"," These weren't sold puts."
"3013120","3014300"," These are bought puts."
"3016380","3017400"," That's a good question. "
"3022200","3023940"," These are not sold puts."
"3024180","3025080"," These were bought yesterday."
"3025860","3026300"," Slammed. "
"3026300","3030180"," I don't know if it was a long hedge fund that needed to buy them for protection."
"3030800","3032800"," It could have been a hedge fund that was long."
"3033660","3036780"," So, if you're a long only hedge fund, I don't know what you are. "
"3037560","3039680"," No matter what hedge fund that you are, right?"
"3039760","3047080"," If you're a hedge fund, a family office, if you're a bank and you're selling products to your"
"3047080","3051940"," customers in your charter, that's not the"
"3051940","3057660"," word for it."
"3058480","3063220"," If the market trades down to a certain level, we will buy protection."
"3064060","3069240"," So, some of these hedge funds are required to, at certain points, put on protection. "
"3070580","3073320"," And oftentimes, it's at the wrong price, right?"
"3074100","3078480"," So, they won't carry the correct protection while they're along the market."
"3079220","3083940"," And then, if the market starts to trade down, they're required to buy protection."
"3092730","3093750"," Yeah, Jam Crescent. "
"3098680","3100520"," Look, I got nothing negative to say about."
"3103560","3111280"," I think Jam is related to S.G. Yeah, I think Jam Crescent, I think he is the owner of"
"3111280","3112220"," S.G. It could be wrong."
"3112780","3116820"," Or he's just a trader on S.G. He's wrapped up in S.G. in some way. "
"3144140","3147100"," They've actually been manufacturing cars to the past three weeks."
"3147720","3155060"," They're just storing them inside, waiting for."
"3158680","3162520"," Do I think there's a catalyst that will influence the price again, or will the market just"
"3162520","3163480"," overwhelm this?"
"3164340","3173280"," I'm not sure if I might need more words, but what you know is that the market is more than"
"3173280","3180800"," likely waiting on an announcement from the Fed today at one o'clock in the afternoon if they're"
"3180800","3182180"," going to be bullish or bearish. "
"3182180","3184340"," So, you're in a holding pattern right now in the market."
"3184820","3187180"," You can see it being played out in spy right now."
"3188180","3192280"," We're in between that 470 level and this 463 level. "
"3192680","3195620"," This is a volatility range for the market."
"3196760","3198940"," And we're basically in a holding pattern, right?"
"3199560","3205840"," So, if you have a bullish or bearish outlook in the market, you're going to be waiting for this"
"3205840","3209600"," announcement at one o'clock this afternoon and it's going to send us either down or up."
"3212740","3215100"," No, he's not related to S.G. Okay, maybe he's not. "
"3215260","3215720"," Maybe I'm wrong."
"3215720","3219440"," So, that's my bad then."
"3220280","3221700"," I guess they're different people. "
"3226330","3228210"," Yeah, I know Brent runs it."
"3228390","3235500"," I know Brent runs S.G. But I thought that Jam was part of S.G. Oh, he does."
"3236740","3238420"," Jam pokes fun at Brent sometimes. "
"3240220","3241640"," He owns Kai Volatility."
"3242040","3243640"," Okay, so I'm wrong on that one."
"3244120","3246540"," I thought they were connected somehow. "
"3254360","3257740"," Jam was a bit critical of S.G.'s take on JPM roll."
"3257740","3261200"," Yeah, I disagreed with Jam on that as well."
"3261420","3265280"," So, I agreed more on the side with S.G. than I did with Jam. "
"3276460","3277620"," So, what?"
"3277940","3281060"," So, S.G. high up the JPM collar."
"3282080","3287000"," And I remember, I do remember Jam saying no or I, it's too much hype."
"3287960","3294020"," But I guess if you ask people today, was the hype real?"
"3294520","3295780"," I guess you can say that it is, right?"
"3296600","3297040"," To an extent?"
"3298700","3310720"," Seems like a pin on 4.98, 4.69. Hood"
"3310720","3312900"," is coming into a little bounce area here. "
"3313440","3319100"," The VWAP is 15.37 on hood."
"3320040","3324900"," The real buyers are down here at 15 bucks, which is really what I want to own it at."
"3325600","3331280"," If I can own hood at 15, oh, wait a minute, hold on here. "
"3331280","3339370"," We got a new price target on hood of"
"3339370","3341750"," 1362."
"3342370","3346410"," I don't think we get that low."
"3347130","3349550"," All right, I'll buy it at 1362. "
"3354890","3358010"," I ended up getting book map added DX feed in Hero Indicator."
"3358390","3362530"," It's showing me directionally the same data as you, but different numbers overall."
"3365360","3367880"," Maybe it's just time delay, a couple minutes or something. "
"3369920","3372620"," Is it because I have more history loaded?"
"3373360","3374400"," I don't know."
"3374740","3376300"," So I save my history every day."
"3379640","3380800"," Are you going to stream the news?"
"3382060","3383080"," Jam was wrong. "
"3384260","3386840"," You could see Delt is coming in for JPM."
"3388480","3390320"," Yeah, I thought Jam was wrong as well."
"3391100","3394520"," I didn't agree with what Jam had to say about the JPM caller. "
"3401110","3406230"," Yeah, David, are you bullish or bearish on Bullard?"
"3408700","3410300"," Oh, is someone else that was buying?"
"3410300","3418460"," Yeah, I think Damien's called me Jimmy Jim Jim for months now, right?"
"3424970","3428950"," Is it because you have more history loaded in book map?"
"3429630","3430570"," I'm unsure."
"3430830","3433830"," My numbers are the same or my numbers are for today."
"3434230","3444130"," So when I day traded the spy, I load the same book map from previous sessions, but I don't"
"3444130","3445690"," record my previous sessions. "
"3446050","3448370"," Are you recording your previous sessions, Henry?"
"3448370","3454590"," Okay, so 1350."
"3454970","3458770"," I'm going to be looking to buy hood at 1350 today."
"3459650","3462530"," You can see the turn right now on Tesla. "
"3463170","3467390"," Tesla bounced off of 1077."
"3492560","3493900"," Yeah, the cumulative data."
"3494420","3496360"," I don't record it because of the..."
"3496360","3501140"," You know what, I was thinking that last week, you guys are bringing up a good point about book map"
"3501140","3502220"," because that was one. "
"3502220","3503580"," I have some..."
"3503580","3511420"," I've got some NAS servers, and I was wondering if I could record my book map and leave it on"
"3511420","3512260"," my NAS server."
"3512580","3520360"," So I think I have like a 16 terabyte NAS server, and I was wondering if I could save or"
"3520360","3523160"," record or save all my information there."
"3532240","3534560"," Yeah, I want hood really low. "
"3534980","3542300"," The lowest, the thing to do with hood is, that we were talking about was hood is very much like"
"3542300","3542820"," Viacom."
"3544340","3547220"," They produce something that's of value."
"3547900","3554620"," You know that they beat down both of these stocks, and whether you agree or disagree with, if you"
"3554620","3556400"," like Viacom, if you like hood, it doesn't really matter. "
"3556640","3558260"," It's that they're a real true business."
"3559980","3564220"," And what you can do is you just find the lows and then you buy some way outside the money"
"3564220","3568900"," calls once a month or so, and they should hit."
"3569120","3572760"," And if they don't hit today, they're eventually going to hit in a big way. "
"3573200","3580180"," So let's say, instead of buying in the money calls on hood or Viacom, if you were to just buy"
"3580180","3587340"," 10 cent calls for, let's say, a year, you end up spending what a buck, or over 10 months, you"
"3587340","3595280"," end up spending a dollar over the course of a year, and if, let's say, Viacom is merged or bought"
"3595280","3602340"," by another company, let's say Roku bought Viacom, you'd see Viacom go up to like 70 bucks, 100"
"3602340","3608920"," bucks, and if you had 10 cent calls, you'd end up printing 10,000%, some stupid, it'd be a"
"3608920","3609740"," ridiculous number."
"3610520","3614320"," You'd wind up only spending a buck, and the same thing goes for hood."
"3615900","3626140"," If hood ends up replacing Vlad or rolling out a new app, right, maybe"
"3626140","3632160"," with something looking like Webull, or if they were bought by, let's say, a bank, let's say like, I"
"3632160","3639960"," don't know, Chase Bottom, something like that, then you'd see hood go from 10 bucks to 70 or 100"
"3639960","3640220"," bucks. "
"3653200","3660870"," You guys want to know what the, sorry, I'll bring up the spy again for you guys, right?"
"3661150","3665250"," So this is how the, the reason why I like trading the spy is because it's easy, it's liquid, you"
"3665250","3669900"," guys all know this, and it's the actual market health."
"3680080","3687380"," I don't know at this point, so yesterday we took the contrarian trade, because everybody knew"
"3687380","3692080"," everybody knew everybody knew, but in reality, today is different than yesterday."
"3698150","3704080"," I can tell you for sure that today is different, cell puts on hood. "
"3704240","3708140"," Yeah, you buy the, you buy the underlying and cell puts down to like eight bucks or five bucks or"
"3708140","3710780"," something on hood, it's a no brainer."
"3712990","3715930"," You guys don't want to get caught with your pants down on spy."
"3716790","3726400"," Well, I can tell you for sure, right, that you know we've got, should I post my levels on"
"3726400","3730440"," Twitter maybe, so you guys can see where we actually are on the market?"
"3732200","3734300"," You guys want to see where the levels are?"
"3734460","3737740"," You guys want me to post the charts for you so you can stop your own lines?"
"3739340","3747500"," Okay, so start cap and hood and Viacom are totally different businesses. "
"3748060","3750580"," Okay, so let's talk about both businesses, okay?"
"3753970","3755590"," Let's talk about both businesses."
"3757490","3765250"," So if I were to compare hood to Rivian, let's get Robinhood versus Rivian."
"3765690","3766530"," It's a great example. "
"3767890","3769710"," Does Rivian produce cars?"
"3771750","3772730"," The answer is no."
"3774790","3779510"," Does Robinhood have a customer base that pays, right?"
"3779990","3781470"," Well, through order flow selling, right?"
"3782130","3783150"," We know that happens in the background."
"3783610","3784530"," We just don't know it, right?"
"3787610","3791370"," Does Viacom have a business?"
"3791950","3792490"," Eh, kinda. "
"3793290","3795450"," What's valuable about Viacom?"
"3796130","3802330"," They have a book full of TV shows, movies, that kind of stuff, right?"
"3802910","3809090"," They have content that they've made that was important years ago, and it's now important for"
"3809090","3811190"," content providers to have."
"3811190","3815650"," So Viacom will more than likely merge or rebot out by some other company."
"3816230","3817490"," But they have some value. "
"3818170","3819950"," Does Rivian have value?"
"3820530","3822110"," What is Rivian's value?"
"3822370","3824890"," Rivian's value is basically a badge, right?"
"3825810","3827730"," It's just the name, Rivian."
"3828170","3829350"," They don't have any vehicles."
"3829770","3830270"," They have no plants. "
"3830630","3832170"," They have some engineering in office space."
"3833030","3837010"," They have produced some concept vehicles."
"3841110","3842770"," And that's the comparison I'm trying to make. "
"3843910","3848030"," Is Viacom a business with actual customers or do you not?"
"3850090","3853030"," And it doesn't matter if Robinhood is losing money."
"3853230","3854590"," It's irrelevant to this conversation."
"3855590","3858150"," The relevance is, are you producing something?"
"3858750","3859650"," Is it valuable?"
"3860830","3864690"," It doesn't matter if Robinhood is owned by Robinhood any longer. "
"3865190","3870790"," If Vlad's owning it any longer or is the CEO, it matters that they have a viable business."
"3878240","3881000"," Yeah, we're in a different context today than yesterday."
"3881520","3883020"," So we're going to look at Spy real quick. "
"3885400","3887080"," And what do you want to know, right?"
"3887660","3891060"," You want to know that the ceiling today unspies 470."
"3891700","3897040"," I want you to know that major support is 463."
"3899420","3904440"," And you also need to know that 465 or..."
"3904440","3906960"," I'm going to post this on Twitter right now for you guys. "
"3906960","3908920"," Okay, I want you guys to see what the chart is."
"3909300","3913280"," What the actual chart is on a candlestick pattern."
"3992950","3994950"," And I've got the MAs on here. "
"3995210","3997250"," I don't know if you guys can do this without the MAs."
"4001450","4005730"," If you guys want to see what's really going on on the candlestick side of things, you guys are"
"4005730","4007410"," wondering if you should be buying calls and stuff."
"4012230","4013870"," You guys can see where we actually are. "
"4019170","4027800"," If you guys are looking at the candlestick chart on Twitter, we start breaking below 460 and things"
"4027800","4028680"," are going to get really nasty."
"4028680","4032380"," So I just posted it on Twitter so you guys can see what I see."
"4045780","4047800"," So on my side, I'm watching the book map. "
"4048160","4049360"," I've got a candlestick chart."
"4049920","4051180"," I've got Flow Algo up."
"4051660","4054560"," You've got some puts coming out right now on GDX. "
"4055220","4057000"," February 11th, 29p."
"4058560","4061980"," QQQ puts January 18th, 374p."
"4062820","4065760"," Spy puts January 7th, 465p. "
"4066940","4069180"," More Q puts 385p."
"4070180","4074320"," There is some calls coming in on pen gaming."
"4076750","4078550"," January 14th, 48c. "
"4079430","4083450"," Wells Fargo calls January 21st, 55c."
"4086300","4092680"," All you guys know to look feels appropriate to tape or asset purchases at faster pace."
"4093300","4101060"," Daily is saying normalizing balance sheet would come after raising interest. "
"4108090","4110410"," Lots of puts coming in right now on TQQ."
"4110410","4116640"," Lots of puts coming in on, let's look at the Q's real quick."
"4121540","4124740"," It's a whole bunch of puts coming in on the Q's right now. "
"4135939","4141819"," Daily is saying closing in on achieving our two gals in short run balancing, longer run goals."
"4148430","4150170"," No, taper is not QT."
"4153200","4154819"," Taper is not QT. "
"4156620","4159819"," Yeah, we were talking about that yesterday."
"4163430","4164750"," That taper is not QT."
"4165390","4166529"," QT is the money flow. "
"4178000","4179600"," You've got like three things going on."
"4179720","4180420"," You've got tapering."
"4181220","4182240"," You've got rates. "
"4183040","4184640"," You've got the money flow."
"4193730","4195270"," Faraz knows what he's talking about."
"4204860","4212280"," I buy my options on Tasty and I buy my options on AI because it's fast. "
"4212900","4213580"," I can do it quickly."
"4218060","4223380"," We are already expecting two to three rate hikes in 2022."
"4224020","4224780"," We know about this. "
"4231980","4233200"," That's a good point, Nail."
"4233380","4235280"," Indexed algos had no reaction to those."
"4237000","4240200"," Daily comments hitting the news wire. "
"4251060","4253440"," There's some things you need to expect out there."
"4254500","4256380"," We already know about tapering."
"4257080","4259280"," We know about the acceleration of tapering. "
"4259580","4262060"," We already know about two to three rate hikes in 2022."
"4263100","4268580"," What do you expect from that?"
"4268580","4270640"," Those events at certain points, right?"
"4271320","4276340"," You know that there'll be a fair drop from those events, but there are bottoms to those events."
"4277020","4280580"," There are fine bottoms to the market to all those events happening. "
"4282670","4288670"," The one thing that you want to see continue is the money flow."
"4288910","4289990"," We talked about a tub, right?"
"4290110","4292030"," If you're sitting in a tub, we're talking about this yesterday."
"4292110","4297730"," If you have a tub, you're sitting in the tub and there's a faucet with the water on. "
"4297730","4300390"," The water represents the money coming into the market."
"4301350","4308550"," As long as the money flow keeps going, it doesn't matter if they pull the plug out of the tub"
"4308550","4308970"," or not."
"4309430","4317850"," We should be expecting the plug to be pulled in terms of the taper and in terms of rate hikes. "
"4318650","4321510"," They're going to pull the plug out with the money drain out of the tub."
"4323490","4329610"," Yesterday, the fear was not only are they going to pull the plug in the tub, but they're going to"
"4329610","4330750"," shut the money flow off."
"4331010","4332950"," They're going to turn the faucet off at the same time. "
"4333630","4334630"," You really don't want that."
"4335070","4344870"," Even when we began this way back in March or May of 2020, you really wanted to see the money"
"4344870","4349650"," flow coming in, but you wanted to see the plug in the tub."
"4349650","4352310"," The real problem is that we had the plug in the tub. "
"4352390","4353650"," We have the money coming in."
"4354030","4357230"," In reality, you want the plug pulled and you want the money to keep flowing."
"4357430","4363990"," It's kind of like driving a truck or car and you've got an oil leak in your engine, so you're"
"4363990","4366070"," adding oil until you can fix it. "
"4366850","4368130"," But there is still a leak."
"4369830","4375910"," The moment that you fix the engine, if you were to keep the oil into it, it is a problem."
"4381730","4382950"," Could I read the book map?"
"4389880","4390960"," I'm going to have a guest on today. "
"4391540","4392000"," I don't know."
"4392060","4393140"," We could probably get a guest on today."
"4393380","4393960"," So here's the deal. "
"4395040","4397960"," You know that the ceiling on spy is 470."
"4398540","4401600"," You know that the bottom on spy right now is 463 or so."
"4403480","4408110"," Let's look at the cues. "
"4414570","4418270"," We've got something similar taking place on the cues."
"4418850","4421190"," You've got a roof on the cues at 391."
"4421190","4423930"," You've got a bottom on the cues at 383. "
"4424950","4429490"," And the real bottom on the cues is the price target is 380 on the cues."
"4432740","4437780"," So the only question becomes, what is the conversation at one o'clock this afternoon from the Fed?"
"4438280","4441340"," So you have to take a bearish or bullish viewpoint."
"4445320","4447680"," Does the tub have jets that massage you?"
"4448020","4448820"," Yes they do. "
"4449400","4450560"," I love J-POW."
"4455680","4458120"," And I posted that chart for you on Twitter."
"4459220","4462900"," So you can see are we in a bullish or bearish context, right?"
"4463320","4465840"," We have broken below that megaphone that we have. "
"4470190","4470630"," Right?"
"4470790","4472530"," And so what does it become at this point?"
"4472710","4473150"," Sell the rip."
"4476760","4479040"," Look at PayPal up 3%."
"4488550","4489650"," The insane. "
"4500560","4502560"," I'll post the PayPal chart for you right now."
"4534180","4535980"," You guys want to see where the roof is on PayPal?"
"4566340","4567940"," Get Becky quick as the guest."
"4587140","4589280"," You guys see the roof on PayPal up here?"
"4589920","4591260"," By the dip and sell the rip. "
"4602580","4605260"," All the puts are going to be fuel for the move higher."
"4606300","4606740"," Yeah."
"4607080","4612740"," So I tend to agree with that take that Chris has, but the puts are going to be the fuel"
"4612740","4613360"," for the move higher. "
"4613400","4620280"," But you need the Fed to say that they're going to keep the money flowing for that to happen."
"4623120","4634660"," Palo Alto up 6.5%. A lot"
"4634660","4636840"," of Apple calls coming in will take a look at Apple."
"4652660","4654700"," Hey, thanks, dear, to do it. "
"4654960","4655220"," Park."
"4656700","4657560"," How are you doing?"
"4660610","4663010"," GPN up 4.5% to 152."
"4663030","4664450"," That golden ticket is printing. "
"4665210","4666470"," Doesn't care about the rate hike."
"4666650","4666670"," Yeah."
"4666810","4667550"," GPN is nice. "
"4671930","4674230"," Everybody's getting super hella bullish out there, right?"
"4674730","4675470"," You guys are all pumped."
"4682530","4683870"," By the dip on Apple's 172."
"4685190","4694710"," Price target is 174.91. 175.38. Make sure they have enough runway on Apple between now and 1 o "
"4694710","4695250","'clock this afternoon. "
"4695330","4696590"," You've got about an hour and a half."
"4703240","4706800"," VIX hasn't gone that high despite panic yesterday."
"4707120","4708980"," No fuel for big vanu rally. "
"4709720","4716900"," So what you're looking for is you're looking for a decision."
"4717480","4725180"," The market's waiting right now to find more or clearer guidance on the topic of money flow."
"4729610","4730930"," Go take it slow with Becky. "
"4731550","4732490"," She's hot, isn't she?"
"4732890","4733670"," She's super hot."
"4736250","4739190"," We've got these financial hot chicks and hot guys."
"4739690","4742010"," So I know there's women that watch this feed. "
"4742830","4744530"," Who would be a hot financial guy?"
"4746230","4749290"," You guys have like this pot like this."
"4749830","4750170"," I don't know."
"4750810","4753490"," And CNBC is Jim Kramer is not that hot. "
"4753490","4760130"," That guy like Jim Kramer like he does in the morning as he puts lotion on his hairy legs and"
"4760130","4761970"," then rolls his socks up over his ankles."
"4762610","4765110"," So I don't know the hot guy on CNBC is."
"4767430","4768750"," Hood is inching up. "
"4769070","4769710"," Good morning Joe."
"4769930","4770250"," How are you doing?"
"4800550","4801090"," All right."
"4801270","4802210"," So I've got one for you guys. "
"4802370","4802530"," Okay."
"4803190","4804370"," You guys ready for a trade?"
"4818790","4819190"," Okay."
"4819390","4820390"," Well, you know, open up on your charts. "
"4820850","4821890"," O-N-O-N."
"4831180","4832920"," Let's have a look and see what's going on here."
"4853610","4862120"," O-N-O-N in January 21st, 35C"
"4862120","4866240"," January 21st, 40C. "
"4867600","4870420"," You've got two coblocks came in."
"4871120","4877380"," First coblock is for $250,000, 35C expiring January 21st."
"4878540","4884060"," Second coblock is for $40,000. "
"4886300","4888560"," 40C expiring January 21st."
"4888880","4890900"," Take a look at that chart on your own charting software."
"4894760","4895220"," Yeah. "
"4899080","4900320"," Ladies love favor."
"4904430","4906850"," Are we doing the contrarian trade today?"
"4907270","4908030"," More than likely not."
"4908730","4912550"," We're going to take a trade at one o'clock or near it like 1230. "
"4912630","4913410"," We'll take a trade on the spy."
"4915920","4916400"," Yeah."
"4916660","4918660"," I'll post the IWM chart for you right now. "
"4918660","4926400"," I'll post the trade, but I want you guys first to look at O-N-O-N right here."
"4927240","4937450"," I want you guys to open up a chart on O-N-O-N and see"
"4937450","4938270"," if that's a viable trade."
"4938470","4940410"," Let me know if you guys think it is or it isn't. "
"4943740","4947160"," Looks like real support is down below here at 30 bucks."
"4948420","4955080"," So maybe you set an alert in your trading software, snap a line at 30 bucks, and if you can"
"4955080","4960200"," buy O-N-O-N at 30 bucks, it looks like it would be a nice trade."
"4961360","4971260"," The other thing to consider here is there are super clear skies above O-N once you break"
"4971260","4981040"," through $33.94 and $34.46. This is a nice squeeze play actually, and"
"4981040","4987020"," those calls that I was talking to you about maybe you set an alert at like 30 bucks, and if"
"4987020","4988500"," we can enter those calls that would be nice. "
"4995110","4999730"," Yeah, 35C, 40C, and hopefully we can get it."
"4999790","5001250"," It looks like we went down to 30 bucks."
"5001310","5002750"," Do we already get down to 30 bucks already?"
"5006160","5010440"," Went down to $32, and it's starting to rip already. "
"5016510","5018750"," So watch O-N-O-N right here and see what happens."
"5018750","5032630"," And if"
"5032630","5041620"," we break through, if you're able to break through $34.64,"
"5042400","5044620"," there's clear skies above."
"5049290","5051970"," And it's Oscar November, Oscar November. "
"5075910","5090800"," Yeah, Hood got a great bounce off 15 bucks or $14.80. A hard rejection off $14 "
"5090800","5096720",".80. What I'm doing these live streams is hard for me to track tickers."
"5100230","5101330"," That's a good hood real quick."
"5108260","5109640"," I think Kathy just bought Hood. "
"5110620","5115940"," Yeah, I'm looking at Hood."
"5122540","5124300"," Look at that gorgeous support at $15."
"5124920","5126320"," I can't believe I just missed that trade. "
"5127140","5128160"," I'm all pissed off."
"5129060","5132740"," But you still have the real dip down on Hood who said $13.57 still."
"5133020","5138040"," So I'm going to wait for 13 bucks, but we'll watch right here and see if we ricochet off. "
"5138620","5141940"," If I can get those calls at $13.00, I'm all on board."
"5147510","5150350"," Why would O-N-O-N rip?"
"5151770","5152950"," Because there's no ceiling above it."
"5166350","5171170"," Because you more than likely have a large hedge on that ticker. "
"5173780","5177580"," And if you're, not hedge, but you've got a large short position on that ticker."
"5178120","5183820"," And if you are short and you start to lose money, what do you do?"
"5183820","5187540"," You lift that short off and you get a short covering rally."
"5188120","5188960"," Does that make sense?"
"5203480","5204460"," And that's what you want to see break. "
"5204740","5206760"," You want to see the sellers being absorbed."
"5208420","5209880"," And you can see that right here."
"5209980","5213900"," You've got more buyers than sellers on on right now. "
"5215240","5216200"," O-N-O-N."
"5216540","5218940"," You can see that there are more buyers than sellers here, right?"
"5219040","5221900"," And the bottom right hand side on the CVD buyer side."
"5222420","5223500"," You have more buyers than sellers. "
"5223500","5231660"," You've got resistance above at $33.92. And you've got resistance above there at $34.53. So if you"
"5231660","5236580"," break above these two, if you absorb these sellers, you'll move much, much higher, much faster."
"5237520","5241820"," There real money though on this ticker is at $30."
"5242740","5247940"," So you'd be looking for entry at $30 to write it to at least $33 or $34. "
"5249020","5251220"," And then maybe pick it up again once it breaks through."
"5262480","5264500"," Your PT for hood is $21."
"5274760","5280560"," Have some calls coming in on Robinhood right now, January 7th, 16C. "
"5283600","5287160"," So we were already talking about Robinhood right earlier and now you can start to see the call flow"
"5287160","5289600"," coming in on Robinhood now."
"5299720","5301900"," Yeah, price target on Robinhood is $17."
"5308570","5320300"," And you're by the dip on Robinhood is $15 and $13.72. $13 "
"5320300","5324140",".72 and a flat $15. "
"5324820","5325640"," You write it to $17."
"5330190","5331250"," It's a nice price target."
"5337500","5339640"," Looks like big hood buys or fueled by CNBC. "
"5345060","5346620"," Yeah, I like HUD right now."
"5346620","5348440"," There's a bunch of stocks that are like this."
"5348600","5354000"," So yesterday one other thing we talked about, a bunch of people logged off yesterday while we were"
"5354000","5354760"," talking about this. "
"5355380","5364320"," And that would be that when we are on rallies, you want to be looking for stocks that don't"
"5364320","5365740"," participate in rallies."
"5366900","5374340"," If you can identify them on Finviz, which stocks are not participating in rallies, you write a list"
"5374340","5377260"," of those stocks, let's say on Finviz, which ones didn't participate."
"5378240","5381220"," And then you know that there's heavy shorting and heavy hedging. "
"5381320","5389320"," It's a very basic way to identify where real hedging is taking place, where real shorts are on"
"5389320","5390720"," stocks, right?"
"5391900","5395560"," And yesterday we had, of course everybody knows we had a sell-down yesterday."
"5396380","5403600"," And you want to go on Finviz and identify which stocks did not participate in the sell-off."
"5403600","5411940"," And I posted or on the livestream yesterday I showed how to identify stocks by industry and sector"
"5411940","5414600"," that did not participate in the sell-off. "
"5415060","5420840"," And the reason that you're looking at those stocks is because it means that banks are long in those"
"5420840","5423540"," stocks, they're not selling out or protecting themselves."
"5424060","5427580"," They want those stocks to go up whether the market's going up or going down."
"5427580","5434940"," So if you look at Finviz from yesterday, during the sell-down you can identify quickly and easily"
"5434940","5465280"," which stocks should keep moving regardless of rates, tapering, anything, right?"
"5465280","5472780"," Looks like the real price targets are moving up to $17.97 on hood. "
"5474360","5495070"," So I told you earlier the price target is $17, the price target is now $17.91. So"
"5495070","5496450"," we're going to rip higher on hood here."
"5497610","5500390"," You guys tuning in every day to these trades?"
"5502150","5504450"," You guys are tracking the hood trade right now?"
"5504450","5513650"," Oh, and look at this, we've got some target TGT puts coming in January"
"5513650","5531530"," 14th, 227.5. And"
"5531530","5532110"," that makes sense."
"5534810","5542870"," So you've got people trading on, I don't want to make fun of Elliott Wave sometimes, but there's an"
"5542870","5549490"," Elliott Wave correction currently happening on target that began back on November 17th. "
"5549490","5557450"," So you've got that one, we tagged 214, bounced up, and now there are bears looking for the second"
"5557450","5562270"," leg down, like a one, two, three, four pattern, right?"
"5562830","5568030"," Or a one, two, three pattern, a one, two, three corrective pattern and target."
"5570060","5575600"," And those target puts are January 14th, 227.5 puts."
"5576820","5579100"," Got lots of hood calls coming in through the door. "
"5580200","5582500"," So hood is very active right now."
"5585620","5589500"," If you guys see hood back down at 15 bucks or 13 bucks, let me know so I can go"
"5589500","5591100"," and buy, I missed that trade myself."
"5593630","5596910"," Someone just bought $5 million worth of Tesla 2000 leaps. "
"5597710","5598210"," Yeah, I like Tesla."
"5599030","5600770"," I'm positive on Tesla right now."
"5604640","5606200"," We talked about Tesla this morning, right?"
"5606680","5607660"," What are you looking for in Tesla?"
"5608360","5610980"," You're looking for 1100. "
"5614260","5614840"," Let's see."
"5615100","5616380"," Let me make sure you got my numbers right."
"5623110","5625010"," You're looking for 1100 to hold. "
"5626030","5629970"," You don't want to sell below 10, 20."
"5630730","5632470"," 10, 20 is negative for Tesla."
"5634430","5638190"," You can, and we talked about testing 1100 all week, right?"
"5638430","5639470"," We've been talking about that all week long. "
"5639870","5641330"," I want to see a test of 1100."
"5642230","5647270"," Because what it does is it confirms the bullish bias of Tesla."
"5647870","5654070"," So we made 1211, we come back down, test 1100, and then you can make the move higher. "
"5655730","5658690"," Now we've broken below 1100 at this point we know, right?"
"5659110","5660750"," But that is that volatility zone."
"5661050","5664450"," Between 1100 and 10, 20 is the volatility zone."
"5664810","5669550"," If we break above 1100 once more, I can assure you that we're bullish on Tesla. "
"5669550","5676790"," And I'm shocked to say that at this point where the market is, that Tesla's trading just like the"
"5676790","5677410"," spy, right?"
"5677790","5681210"," So Tesla's trading alongside the spy, which is nice to see."
"5682150","5688930"," You know that the spy has the trading range that the spy is in this morning, and it's looking for"
"5688930","5690090"," direction from the Fed."
"5692330","5692690"," Yeah. "
"5693110","5694690"," It's about to be my best trade of the year."
"5695150","5698110"," Yeah, let's check it."
"5698230","5698790"," I'll check on that. "
"5698790","5701910"," Yeah, I'll look at an IWM right now as well."
"5734630","5735990"," Both net and IWM."
"5745030","5746170"," Okay, so net. "
"5747390","5757370"," Smart money is at 100, 1017, and 102.13. I would"
"5757370","5759390"," expect these buyers will come up to 102."
"5760570","5767910"," And the sell of the rip on net is 108.77. Hope that helps."
"5782000","5785360"," Why don't you guys call out some tickers to me, right?"
"5785800","5790700"," Call out some tickers that you think are at support, and not at resistance. "
"5792340","5797600"," Rather than looking at tickers that are bouncing off resistance, tell me some tickers that you"
"5797600","5798540"," think are at support."
"5800060","5804820"," So rather than having the trade that's already taken place, let's look at a trade that could"
"5804820","5806120"," possibly happen."
"5806120","5817530"," Yeah, 1180 is still resistance, or"
"5817530","5819050"," not, yeah, not 1180, 1100. "
"5819910","5823250"," So you've got minor resistance at 1080, I apologize."
"5823870","5825670"," You have minor resistance at 1080."
"5827150","5829710"," You've got major resistance at 1100, right?"
"5830650","5833550"," You've got by the dip at 1020. "
"5834190","5835570"," So if you're a bull, what do you do?"
"5836230","5837690"," You wait to buy the dip at 1020."
"5837690","5842210"," You ride it to 1080, 1100."
"5842810","5846110"," You wait for the banks to take it over 1100, and then you pick it back up. "
"5846550","5852770"," If you're a bear, you're going to be taking the short side of that trade at 1080, 1100, and hoping"
"5852770","5855870"," that it goes down to 1020."
"5856330","5860970"," And then you get out of that trade, and you'd re-enter it if you broke below 1020, right?"
"5861310","5867670"," You take it for the ride in that volatility zone, and then you wait for the banks to do the"
"5867670","5869610"," other side of that if you're a bull or a bear."
"5880360","5883340"," You've got more buyers than sellers, you've got positive gamma. "
"5883900","5890260"," Not positive, but you've got positive options buying on, so you've got positive call buying on IWM"
"5890260","5890860"," right now."
"5891980","5894100"," Slightly more buyers than sellers than IWM."
"5901820","5905960"," Okay, make sure you're giving me what you think is a support. "
"5906640","5910440"," If I bring up these charts, and I see you guys showing me charts where I'm resistance, I'm going to"
"5910440","5910960"," kill myself."
"5912760","5914130"," Would you mind pulling up GME?"
"5914960","5917240"," Looks like heavy volume, finally."
"5917520","5918540"," Okay, we'll start with GME. "
"5920780","5921880"," I already showed hood."
"5922100","5926220"," You guys can pause it and go back and see what the support and resistance is on hood."
"5926980","5933550"," I want to be a buyer down in the $13 range somewhere, and my price target on hood I think"
"5933550","5934710"," is $19 now. "
"5937640","5938620"," So we'll look at GME."
"5957030","5958590"," First one right up the gate."
"5961330","5962230"," Killing me guys. "
"5962570","5963930"," You guys are killing me."
"5964410","5968210"," So the buy the dip is $119 on GME."
"5969130","5975410"," Sell the rip is $136.25. Okay, so we got one, we got, we got, we're going to break out. "
"5978140","5980120"," We'll do, for us, I'll do buy due for you."
"5980700","5981660"," I got your brother."
"5984210","5990650"," Please show me, show me buy the dip opportunities, not, not sell the rip stuff. "
"6003390","6004570"," Same thing above here."
"6005150","6007370"," You guys are all in these trades and wondering, aren't you?"
"6007750","6008610"," Should I sell now?"
"6009010","6009410"," Tell."
"6012800","6014200"," Guys, you're killing me with these trades. "
"6018500","6025520"," All right, so you got buy due at localized resistance at $150.93. Your price target on buy due, or"
"6025520","6026960"," though is $180."
"6027820","6030700"," If you're very bullish on buy due, that's your target."
"6031060","6037180"," You've got some more resistance here at $158.44. But I'll buy due at this point. "
"6039660","6040440"," Wait a minute here."
"6041500","6051740"," $153.70, $154.48, and then ultimately price target $159.59. $159.59. But,"
"6051760","6054720"," you know, again, you've got a great buying opportunity here, though."
"6054780","6058740"," You've got 82,000 buyers versus 54,000. "
"6059080","6059780"," So maybe a good trade."
"6060820","6065720"," Actually, for Oz, you might have a nice trade on your hands here."
"6066600","6068540"," You get way more buyers and you have sellers. "
"6071580","6073000"," Your price target is 160, bro."
"6073040","6073480"," That's pretty good."
"6075880","6076320"," I like that. "
"6076960","6078180"," I like that trade."
"6087890","6089150"," CRM, sales force."
"6105120","6106300"," I like this trade, actually. "
"6108780","6109800"," It's actually a good trade."
"6111040","6117310"," If you can find support at 230, you can trade this up."
"6117310","6118550"," Oh, I bet. "
"6121840","6123480"," My bad trade coming up here."
"6128920","6130720"," You've got light by the dippers at 230."
"6135380","6137340"," You've got some major support at 228. "
"6143340","6152220"," And the smart money is at 225.37. So set an alert for 225 "
"6152220","6161270",".40, 227.67, and you'll take it to 233 "
"6161270","6167420",".83. So we did CRM."
"6171800","6173360"," I'll do Jenny for you."
"6173500","6178800"," I think AV for me, I think he gave some pretty good trades yesterday. "
"6180080","6183780"," It could be wrong, but I think he gave some good trades yesterday or she or whoever that is."
"6192420","6195060"," Got lots of XLE calls coming in still."
"6195360","6197500"," The energy trade is on full blast right now. "
"6197600","6199280"," It's been on full blast for a couple weeks now."
"6209750","6211570"," Let's say be careful on Jenny this morning."
"6214550","6217090"," I'd say that that's a seller's trade. "
"6217090","6237020"," R-I "
"6237020","6238700","-V-N, Rivian."
"6245740","6246700"," Let's look at Rivian."
"6247940","6249500"," I shouldn't be bashing them so much. "
"6249680","6252240"," I'm not intentionally bashing Rivian."
"6254750","6255710"," That's not my intent."
"6265410","6272690"," You are at support at Rivian at 81.22. And 73. "
"6276650","6278310"," Let's see where the real support lies."
"6280530","6297620"," Support on Rivian right now looks like 76.48. If I had to guess on Rivian, let's"
"6297620","6305440"," see if we can even lower $70.27. This might be a good buy."
"6305900","6306520"," I like this trade. "
"6308830","6309890"," I like Rivian here."
"6312830","6321380"," You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you."
"6326540","6328200"," I don't know if we can get a good reading on this one. "
"6341350","6344290"," You guys want to know where the real money is on you, you, you, you."
"6345090","6346490"," It's at 43 cents."
"6347550","6348010"," Isn't that crazy?"
"6349570","6351310"," Standing order, 43 cents. "
"6353850","6357270"," $5.63 is an important key support."
"6363260","6364460"," No one wants to hear that, right?"
"6364760","6369180"," No one wants to hear $5 on you, you, you, you."
"6380910","6382410"," We're trying to find tops to buy. "
"6385530","6387230"," You guys have so many tickers."
"6389780","6391380"," C-V-N-A."
"6399940","6400960"," Let's check that one. "
"6402200","6413090"," Carvana looks like Rivian is hitting a localized"
"6413090","6414470"," bottom right now."
"6415990","6419090"," Ooh, C-V-N-A."
"6419450","6420230"," That's a nice ticker. "
"6420330","6421030"," Who called that one out?"
"6422030","6424230"," Blood stunt knows what he's doing, I think."
"6430360","6431400"," Ooh, I don't know, blood stunt."
"6433750","6435530"," We're close, but we're not yet there. "
"6436150","6444020"," Snap a support at 185.49. Oh, that's where we are right now."
"6444020","6456600"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa."
"6456600","6457480"," Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. "
"6458280","6459200"," That's a good trade."
"6460000","6461200"," C-V-N-A."
"6463310","6465950"," Blood stunt called out C-V-N-A. "
"6469000","6469580"," Good job."
"6469780","6470400"," Good job."
"6473340","6477960"," 186.32. Hard, hard bottom on C-V-N-A. "
"6490900","6491560"," Nice call."
"6492180","6493680"," Nice call, blood stunt."
"6501990","6502330"," Good job. "
"6502550","6502990"," That was a good one."
"6504170","6505430"," I like seeing those tickers."
"6506310","6507850"," K-M-X. "
"6508650","6509630"," Carm X."
"6510410","6513010"," Looks like we're doing the car trade today, right?"
"6517960","6518540"," Nice trade."
"6518680","6520200"," That's a nice trade on C-V-N-A."
"6533300","6535140"," See what real money is on K-M-X. "
"6541210","6543430"," More buyers than sellers on K-M-X."
"6545150","6547370"," Real money is at 11482."
"6548910","6549470"," 1112. "
"6551510","6556390"," Price target is 124.74. 12448."
"6563970","6565590"," There's your real money down here, right?"
"6566790","6567350"," 11427."
"6568290","6569830"," And 11046. "
"6572540","6573940"," N-U-G-T."
"6576060","6577220"," Let's see that one next."
"6584360","6584580"," Gold miners. "
"6584940","6585940"," A bunch of gold bugs out there."
"6601120","6603480"," By the dip on gold is 4402."
"6605740","6617820"," And the real sellers are at $50.67. A "
"6617820","6622020","-V for me said Jenny mostly because Kramer said Gabbling stocks are dead. "
"6626300","6626860"," NVIDIA."
"6627220","6627840"," We'll do that one next."
"6637180","6640720"," Let's see if NVIDIA's bounce off the bottom. "
"6641500","6643200"," If it really has or hasn't."
"6645860","6647520"," Where is the real money at on NVIDIA?"
"6648220","6649080"," Everybody wants to know."
"6686200","6689940"," Support on NVIDIA right now is at 27136. "
"6692060","6694900"," But it's concerning to see these buyers lower."
"6696860","6701740"," The fact that you've got people that believe are actually going down a 250 in NVIDIA is kind of"
"6701740","6701940"," scary."
"6703060","6703920"," Do you want the truth?"
"6705920","6707880"," We've got buyers at 26029. "
"6708440","6710100"," And then again at 26562."
"6711200","6714760"," Looks like support currently sits at 27162."
"6715860","6717840"," But there's a lot of calls out there. "
"6718140","6719500"," I just wanted to be aware of that."
"6721060","6724440"," You've got a call wallet 31836."
"6727160","6729940"," You do have more sellers than buyers than NVIDIA. "
"6731040","6732780"," This does look like a seller at play."
"6733540","6734920"," Not a by the dip play."
"6746060","6746560"," I'm unsure. "
"6746780","6750800"," I think it's 115pm Omar that the Fed is speaking."
"6752440","6753560"," But it is 1230."
"6753780","6772910"," So this is"
"6772910","6773670"," what I'm going to say about the spy. "
"6773870","6774050"," Okay."
"6774810","6776850"," This is what I want to talk to you guys about the spy now."
"6777130","6777390"," Real quick. "
"6777590","6777990"," It's what I inject."
"6777990","6785320"," You probably get a little bit of a rip here from now into when Bullard speaks."
"6787600","6792620"," So if you position yourself and puts too early, you stand to lose some money. "
"6793480","6796440"," I would expect at this point that we're going to trade higher."
"6796760","6802160"," Probably trade higher on the spy to you guys ready for it?"
"6802540","6802880"," Hold on."
"6813840","6823800"," I'm going to expect that we trade up on the spy somewhere between"
"6823800","6827860"," 470 and 470. "
"6829380","6830080"," Is that right?"
"6831640","6832040"," Yeah."
"6832860","6835780"," Between 470 and 470 and then we're going to sell down."
"6839060","6840440"," So we'll trade up here for a little bit. "
"6841000","6842780"," Probably going to hit some resistance and then we'll sell off."
"6846570","6848330"," And what will be my price target once we sell off?"
"6848570","6849070"," You guys want to know?"
"6853880","6854260"," 460."
"6856100","6856960"," That's the price target. "
"6860640","6860880"," Okay."
"6861320","6862520"," So ASO."
"6862820","6864240"," We did that in a video. "
"6864240","6867260"," I did nugget."

"7034660","7037800"," I can't really, I'm not really getting too much data on it. "
"7039100","7041600"," You have slightly more buyers, probably better trades out there."
"7042100","7043120"," It's not that it's not a good trade."
"7043400","7045460"," It's not really moving right now. "

"7105070","7107330"," Buyers are also in at 2.50, 22."
"7108090","7110310"," Looks like we're grinding through some resistance right now."
