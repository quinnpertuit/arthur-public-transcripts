"5130","6550"," All right, what do we got a minute left?"
"11050","11330"," Sorry."
"11450","13670"," I'm munching on some breakfast that you can hear me out there."
"25900","27300"," You all watching this right now. "
"48410","49710"," I hope you're all watching this."
"50850","51290"," Who's here?"
"52290","54450"," We got 39 right away right on it."
"54610","55310"," Good morning, everybody. "
"57610","59090"," Let's say it's Kristoff or Phillip."
"60710","63170"," F1, A darts, Chaz, Biki."
"63890","65310"," I lost the toe to X, Henry. "
"66330","67150"," Good morning, y'all."
"69230","70550"," Y'all watching this right now."
"78130","78930"," Ben, Charles, John. "
"80470","81670"," Good morning, Belgian."
"81910","82230"," Good morning."
"82630","83170"," How y'all doing?"
"85250","88450"," All right, so what I'm going to do is I'm going to start off this morning. "
"89730","92430"," We'll talk to you guys about what the plan is here."
"92650","96290"," So we have, if you guys have the charts from last week."
"98370","100630"," We've got some clear skies above. "
"100810","106500"," We're going to take a look right now and find out where we are."
"106640","113660"," Okay, so we're breaking through any semblance of a wall on spy right now so that you can see right"
"113660","114240"," out the gate."
"114260","124180"," We had supply at 471.99, 472.23. And you can actually see this morning that sellers"
"124180","129740"," are, you just got to turn, you just got to turn bull, I guess, right?"
"131020","135360"," You're going to see our first, our first top here is going to be 473. "
"136160","137420"," This is where we should bounce."
"139830","141810"," I got to check my calls right now."
"156480","159080"," And you can see that big green bubble right there, right?"
"160240","162760"," I'm sure you guys are watching this trading right now. "
"173920","174640"," Come on now."
"176180","177500"," Where is my money?"
"183080","184140"," I'm going to print this morning."
"184280","184820"," I can already tell. "
"185700","187200"," I don't exactly what's up this morning."
"189960","190780"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"191800","193080"," That's what I'm talking about. "
"201800","207420"," You guys want to see where all of the, where the real wall is."
"207700","208740"," You guys want to know where the real wall is."
"208760","209360"," This morning. "
"212360","216440"," So you can see right now that sellers are being absorbed."
"216540","216860"," Okay."
"217400","221920"," You can see that because of where this red line below and the red line above is right here. "
"223340","226240"," That from below the liquidity is coming in."
"226500","229300"," You can see that there's just a small wall at 475."
"230120","231520"," I mean, we're not even talking a big wall. "
"232200","234260"," So what are we looking at above from there?"
"235620","237840"," Clear skies to almost 480."
"238320","242560"," So we'll call that at, let's see where the, where the wall actually is."
"245160","247500"," I'm going to log in on this, this brokerage too. "
"250800","253360"," Yeah, 480 is, you can see it right here."
"253480","253720"," We've got."
"254340","258339"," So we're starting to eat through some sellers where we are right now. "
"258360","264200"," And then the next, the next minor resistance will be 475 and then 477."
"276800","277940"," Let me just second guys."
"278100","279360"," I got to check my account here. "
"279900","280860"," I got a bunch of."
"284730","285730"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"285950","287130"," Look at that money. "
"290090","293970"," Yeah, 477 should be the price target for this week at minimum."
"294170","298310"," If not a little bit higher, you'll see this grind up during the Christmas rally."
"299270","301310"," It won't stop until it hits up there. "
"301470","303510"," I shouldn't stop until it hits 477."
"311230","312930"," We've just got grind right now."
"313650","314250"," Let's see. "
"314250","320660"," We get slightly more sellers than buyers, but it doesn't matter."
"320660","324020"," You're going to get a kick in here normally like we're at 935."
"326060","333920"," So you figure day traders are always waiting to see if we get the fake out bounds below or if"
"333920","342560"," we start ripping above and then they wait to enter until we take a look here. "
"344020","345620"," But yeah, we're going straight up today."
"345740","350160"," We'll probably moon shot Tesla's moon shotting right now 1000 87."
"351140","352500"," We're going to get that 1100. "
"352840","360520"," We talked about today then without a doubt and the spies going to go straight up as well."
"360920","362960"," So you've got some resistance above."
"363020","364180"," We talked about this right. "
"364320","370400"," We got some resistance at 473 40, but you can see these nice big green circles here."
"370860","372620"," These are the sellers being absorbed."
"373120","375540"," You can see down below here that the buyers are stepping in. "
"375740","378780"," They're going to FOMO because there's no selling today."
"379540","380920"," So we're going to go straight up here."
"380960","381860"," You can see this, right?"
"382960","387900"," And you can see down below on the right hand side that we have 209,000 sellers, but the buyers"
"387900","390160"," are just about to consume the sellers. "
"390720","392860"," We're just a few moments away from that happening here."
"399730","400050"," Nice."
"402030","403370"," Always like seeing this. "
"410850","414710"," Yeah, and those calls was 480 C's off the belt."
"414870","415930"," Well, they're 26 cents."
"416170","417810"," They're now up to 40 cents right now. "
"418310","426570"," And you've got a bunch of interest in 479 C for the 31st looks like there's someone bought 8000 of"
"426570","431650"," the 479 C's aspiring on December 31 that 56 cents right now."
"431650","435590"," That's where all the interest is for weeklies, just as the heads up."
"436970","439370"," So someone thinks we're going to 479. "
"439710","443270"," Let's look at the December 29th expiry."
"444170","453550"," There's a bunch on 473, 474, 475, and then for zero dates today, everybody's on"
"453550","454970"," 475s."
"455290","457330"," Those are 27 cents. "
"458830","467720"," And that's surprising because the real sailing here is, well, yeah, I guess that is the first"
"467720","469500"," sailing is 475 for this morning."
"470720","472760"," And the next one is at 477."
"473140","474680"," This is actually a better chart right here. "
"475480","479040"," And I'll bring up Tesla right now, too, for any of you out there that are trading Tesla."
"479940","481740"," The Christmas rally is today."
"481920","489280"," In case any of you didn't know, no matter where we went up into Christmas from now into end of"
"489280","491580"," year, we are in the Christmas rally. "
"492000","495040"," This is when the window dressing comes into the market."
"495420","501440"," So if any of you guys don't know that, this is where I want to look at Apple too right"
"501440","508840"," now because I'm going to assume that the banks want Apple to print handsomely for them."
"508840","514100"," Yeah, and Apple is already at 178.32. It looks like it's just ripping. "
"521520","525120"," Let you guys know where the real money flow is this morning."
"527590","530790"," Where the ceiling is on Tesla, you guys want to know, right?"
"531530","534030"," You've got support stepping right in on Tesla."
"537810","543410"," This is the same wall that we talked about on Thursday, 1100, minor wall at 1099. "
"544410","545990"," It's only another dollar, right?"
"546570","547950"," And we bounced off that."
"548170","549050"," You can see back here."
"549090","550430"," We bounced off that 1099. "
"551610","557330"," So you might be asking where the buyers and you can see currently they're stepping right in."
"557450","558750"," You see this red line down here."
"559150","562290"," And you've got this yellow line at 1090, 1088. "
"567850","571270"," And then again down below here at 1077."
"571470","573270"," Let me find out what number that is there."
"575050","584130"," You've got large buyers at 1070.10. Good morning, by the way, everybody. "
"584590","586190"," Hope you're all printing happily this morning."
"587710","588610"," Everybody's making money."
"593470","593890"," All right. "
"594050","597350"," Let me give you guys the where the money flow is this morning."
"598330","599830"," Tesla's number one period."
"600530","601510"," You ready for these numbers?"
"602770","609290"," We've got February 18th, 1100 calls for $3.7 million. "
"610630","613390"," That means a bid's coming into Tesla into February."
"614010","617230"," That opened, that raises the call wall on Tesla."
"618250","624510"," You've got 1231, 1150s for 366,000 bucks on Tesla. "
"625150","631730"," You've got June 17th, 1250s for $12.5 million on Tesla."
"632690","633630"," How do you like them apples?"
"634790","636690"," And say no, I got to post this stuff on Twitter."
"636690","639050"," Apple, four orders. "
"639230","647130"," This is the number two most bullish stock, 1231, 175c, 1231, 175c again."
"647550","649230"," Those are two million dollar bets."
"649330","654050"," I got another 1231, 175c for $1.2 million. "
"655010","658950"," Another 1231, 170c for a half million dollars."
"659390","661890"," So Apple is the second most bullish stock this morning."
"661890","668030"," Next up, Amazon got an $800,000 bet on 3500c. "
"668750","675190"," CME, $861,000 bet, 121, 220c."
"676190","681850"," Nvidia, whole bunch of small bets looking for a 310 and 315 on 1231."
"682510","691350"," So huge Facebook, two bets, 1231, 342.5 and 340c this morning. "
"691970","697050"," So I'm going to post this stuff for you guys on Twitter right now so you can see where the"
"697050","698250"," money flow is."
"699950","701490"," We're just going to grind up here."
"701690","706990"," If any of you guys have bears out there, I'd be careful because you know how this grind goes. "
"707510","708870"," It just doesn't stop."
"716430","721550"," That's for earnings, Meliello saying, is that, are you talking about Tesla, Tesla earnings or is"
"721550","723890"," that for making this money?"
"724770","725830"," Nvidia's burn right?"
"727350","728310"," Good morning everybody."
"729270","730770"," I'm just scrolling through right now. "
"730850","735370"," I got to put some posts up for you guys on Twitter so that you can see where the money"
"735370","736030"," flow is."
"742100","745280"," Tell me this doesn't take some of the guesswork out of the day, right?"
"746420","748880"," So where do you buy the, where do you buy the dip, right?"
"749120","750180"," You buy the dip down here."
"750260","751640"," This is at 930 right off the bell. "
"752440","759360"," The dip buys at 470.50. You're going to enter this small resistance right here, 473."
"761120","763880"," And then you're going to be looking to take profit at force."
"764080","766400"," I'm going to, I'm holding until 477 without a doubt. "
"767660","768760"," I'm not letting go of anything."
"769080","778900"," I've got some 477, 478 spreads and then I've got some, just some calls out there kicking around on"
"780460","780780"," the spy."
"781060","782660"," I'm on the spy, just so you guys know. "
"783180","788460"," And I lost some puts that I held over the weekend, but they were, they were pennies, so that didn't"
"788460","788940"," really matter."
"790120","799720"," And I'm probably going to add, probably going to add some more 479s or"
"799720","804560"," 480s for the 31st here, if I can get a spy at any point, takes a breather."
"804680","811670"," But if it doesn't, I don't know what I'm going to end up doing, because I want to add some"
"811670","811910"," more. "
"814820","817340"," I don't know how many guys remember every year how this goes."
"817960","820260"," Yeah, and Apple's just crushing it right now."
"831880","833660"," Nasrags up 140 points. "
"838590","840470"," Still have that oil play going on."
"853240","854920"," Still seeing a bit into Oxy."
"855660","864060"," Get some of this stuff out there for you. "
"895080","898800"," Okay, so this will show you some of the trades for this morning."
"899560","901920"," So I'm posting for you now on the Captain's Alpha."
"903080","904580"," Some of the flow that's coming in. "
"912130","915750"," You guys are all probably just trade and spy this morning or Tesla, huh?"
"923600","926420"," The post for you guys and live flow as it comes in."
"943200","947180"," Do you guys have any specific tickers you want me to put up this morning?"
"950680","956340"," Yeah, so your wife's boyfriend is saying that he's going to reposition his hedge this morning for"
"956340","956560"," cheaper."
"957160","961860"," Last night we had a zoom call, if any of you are listening out there right now, we had a"
"961860","965120"," zoom call and I was talking to everyone about it. "
"966080","969100"," How to look for a hedge, how to hedge."
"970920","979640"," You are looking so originally I wanted to buy a hedge for the third for January 3rd."
"979640","983160"," It was a 460 P, but it didn't get cheap enough. "
"983180","985940"," It wasn't down around 20, 30 cents."
"986600","989140"," It was still like a dollar 20 or something dollar 13."
"989140","990200"," I think at the close. "
"990820","993200"," So it's too it costs too much money."
"993980","1002400"," So the alternative to that would have been to buy some 460 P's expiring this morning for 8 cents."
"1003900","1009820"," And even if they burn rather than buy that 120 P at 460, right?"
"1009980","1011580"," Market tends to go up over time. "
"1012180","1019980"," You can just spend 8 cents every day, 8 cents, 5 cents, 7 cents as we make our way into"
"1019980","1020460"," the third."
"1020460","1026260"," If it burns, you're only burning by the end of the week, maybe 30, 40 cents rather than a dollar"
"1026260","1026500"," 20."
"1027180","1031400"," And you can reposition where you're the strike that you're buying at. "
"1031859","1038079"," So let's say as we move into tomorrow or even Wednesday, you can rent."
"1038380","1045339"," So if if I have a 460 P on Friday, we're now at 473, I can then be looking for"
"1045339","1048420"," a 465 P at end of day today."
"1048420","1049780"," Matter of fact, I'm going to look right now. "
"1051920","1057300"," So as we make our way into, let's take a look and see what we got here."
"1059360","1066980"," So as an example, right, a 465 puts for expiring on the 27th."
"1067040","1067360"," That's today. "
"1067600","1068760"," We're actually looking for Wednesday."
"1069540","1070620"," We're looking at 29."
"1073810","1074030"," Okay. "
"1074230","1077570"," So 460 P for Wednesday is 12 cents."
"1079270","1082370"," 465 is 35 cents expiring on Wednesday."
"1082870","1090030"," So you can spend less money hedging yourself with zero date puts running straight into the new year"
"1090030","1092770"," than you can with buying that week or two week output. "
"1094390","1095970"," That's just going to get killed, right?"
"1096410","1098110"," We already know where support is at 470."
"1098670","1102150"," We already know that the ceiling above is even eroding."
"1102210","1103450"," You can actually see it right here. "
"1104230","1105890"," This is a minor ceiling above."
"1106350","1108590"," We might actually trade to 480 at some point."
"1112410","1114810"," You know, there's clear skies above. "
"1115510","1118190"," If we grind, oh, 485, look at that."
"1121830","1122930"," 485, are you kidding me?"
"1138250","1140190"," Yeah, I'm going to think that the ceiling is 480."
"1140590","1143330"," I'm not so sure in this 45 stuff that I'm seeing here. "
"1144270","1148130"," These are real sellers or if this is spoofing above here."
"1149470","1150570"," 480 is where I'm going to."
"1150750","1151710"," That's where I'm shooting for. "
"1153720","1156660"," So you got 475, 477, and then 480."
"1157460","1158760"," Any of you guys out there watching?"
"1163360","1166300"," You can see that supply is moving up on Tesla now."
"1166400","1167240"," Was that teller?"
"1167460","1168620"," I guess it's still at 1070. "
"1169480","1171120"," You get a hard wall up here at 1100."
"1171860","1175080"," If you break through this or start to consolidate here and you don't bounce off."
"1175820","1177980"," You will see a squeeze in Tesla. "
"1177980","1185020"," It wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility that we break through at some point this week."
"1186800","1192140"," And we do have had just so that does expire on the 31st for Tesla."
"1192740","1196980"," A major hedge on Tesla does expire on 1231. "
"1198080","1199780"," Maybe this is a trade off that."
"1204020","1205440"," Let's see this."
"1226730","1233390"," The implied range for today is 0.56%. Resistance is seen at 4749. "
"1234390","1237290"," Support is seen as 4720 on the spy."
"1240330","1246570"," It is important to note this morning this is by spot gamma that the call wall shifted to 4800."
"1247070","1249550"," So if you're bearish be careful out there. "
"1252500","1258660"," And spot gamma is saying that they expect that the week will mostly drift towards 4800 as the week"
"1258660","1259600"," wraps up."
"1263280","1267360"," Both the cues and IWM hold slightly negative gamma positions."
"1268540","1272420"," So you should expect more movement from the S&P 500 this week. "
"1275080","1280600"," Yeah, and then spot gamma is now this morning spot gamma is talking about the JPM."
"1280940","1284760"," A caller that we talked about last night on Sunday at our group."
"1286820","1293060"," And they're saying that 30% of total S&P gamma expires on Friday. "
"1293060","1298620"," Yeah, it's the largest expiration S&P."
"1298880","1303260"," So you should see some squeezing into Friday due to that gamma expiration."
"1303920","1307540"," And then we talked about what my expectations are into Monday. "
"1308860","1313040"," But that you have to understand that that gamma expiration is massive."
"1314020","1320280"," The 1231 expiration is it's a serious thing."
"1320280","1327760"," That is the tale of the remember that really large move that we made down. "
"1330120","1331380"," We take a look here."
"1331580","1332300"," I'll give you the date."
"1338240","1340980"," Let me give you the date that I'm talking about. "
"1341380","1347950"," There is that one day where we really get on September 20th."
"1348990","1353070"," So on September 20th when we we sold down on the overnight."
"1353870","1362210"," That opened that morning long only hedge funds were forced to buy some hedging. "
"1362930","1367910"," And they bought it for the 1231 expiry back in September."
"1369110","1373390"," And all that stuff expires now coming up on Friday."
"1374130","1378310"," Yeah, we're going to we're going to go straight to the moon on the spy. "
"1378930","1381270"," We're going to moonshot the spy guaranteed."
"1381270","1390960"," You guys should look back on years where we grind into the 31st."
"1391340","1395960"," You'll think that it's absurd as it happens and you might try to take a short position. "
"1396480","1401980"," You'll look over the next four to five days and all you're going to see is green bars straight to"
"1401980","1404360"," the moon into Friday expiry."
"1406420","1408120"," It's going to be kind of wild to watch."
"1411610","1416530"," Let's bring this slightly down here so you guys can see what's happening above here. "
"1444900","1447020"," We're just on the on a grind on the spy."
"1451490","1453090"," We've got some profit taking."
"1453430","1459090"," If you guys are looking for a place to enter spy if you guys miss buying spy or if you're"
"1459090","1460430"," a cash gang over the holidays. "
"1461850","1470550"," You better hope that you can get a chance to buy at 470.50. If not, you can see supply"
"1470550","1471670"," down below here."
"1472770","1479510"," Supply though it right now is currently at 472.81. You can see that little line right in here."
"1480430","1488430"," We saw this resistance above but buyers are stepping right up to buy right now. "
"1488790","1492590"," There's nothing here showing that there's going to be a drop."
"1493450","1494970"," You guys can see this right."
"1495650","1502270"," If you didn't see this by down below here, you would see us drop down to the 470 level. "
"1502650","1507870"," This red bar here is showing that you can see it slightly with this green right here that buyers"
"1507870","1509090"," are meeting the sellers."
"1510190","1515950"," We've got slightly more sellers right now but it's not as much of a concern when the buyers are"
"1515950","1518550"," stepping up right to the ask right now."
"1518550","1563270"," The bid is at 472.81. Let's"
"1563270","1565350"," see if I can get some more of this stuff out to you guys. "
"1581920","1584500"," You can talk about selling puts on the spy."
"1585380","1587240"," It's almost a no brainer selling puts on the spy."
"1607020","1614880"," Get some call for coming in on B.A., Elsid, Lucid, Palantir is getting a bid this morning. "
"1615650","1617180"," 20 C's for 1231."
"1617860","1618900"," More Tesla flow."
"1619120","1620920"," Cisco has some bid coming into it. "
"1621300","1623880"," January 21 65 C."
"1624420","1625120"," That's a nice one."
"1625200","1626860"," I always like seeing them farther dated out."
"1628140","1632190"," We've got a bid in Baba. "
"1633030","1638430"," The queues for the queues for Nasdaq 1227 400 C."
"1639960","1643090"," F-cell is getting a bid this morning and video is getting a bid."
"1644330","1649050"," Nvidia 315 or 1231 315 C."
"1652750","1658310"," Apple has some more calls 175 and 182.5 all dated for 1231."
"1660710","1662830"," AMD has got a weird thing going on this morning. "
"1662970","1666390"," I see a lot of AMD calls but then I do see some AMD puts."
"1667630","1670390"," We'll take a look at AMD real quick for you."
"1671250","1672250"," See what's going on there. "
"1677940","1679660"," If you guys want to give me a shout out here."
"1680140","1681040"," What do you guys?"
"1685320","1686380"," Good morning, Danny."
"1686640","1687400"," I hope you're making money. "
"1688100","1688720"," Morning, Kirk."
"1690300","1691620"," Yeah, those spy calls."
"1692440","1693960"," It's so easy to trade spy. "
"1694780","1696500"," You don't have to trade anything else."
"1697940","1699300"," Yeah, you don't have to trade anything else."
"1699420","1700240"," You just trade spy guys. "
"1701100","1704460"," You can pick one or two other stocks that you've become intimate with."
"1705000","1707020"," Pick yourself an apple or a Tesla or an AMD."
"1708180","1710160"," Just become very familiar with how it trades. "
"1710160","1716600"," But generally speaking, you don't really need to be chasing tickers across the market."
"1717720","1724500"," There's no reason to have to trade hard to make life difficult to have to pick an individual ticker"
"1724500","1730160"," when you know that it's easy enough to just trade the spy."
"1730400","1732900"," Trade a yes, trade the SPX. "
"1734260","1737620"," You can see sellers are being absorbed here at AMD this morning."
"1738540","1745320"," We have way, wait a minute, we've got way more buyers than sellers on AMD."
"1746080","1748400"," You guys should be paying attention this morning to AMD. "
"1749240","1757620"," There's 1.345 million buyers to 692,000 sellers."
"1759620","1761740"," So someone knows something's up."
"1762260","1767240"," My assumption is, so when I'm looking at some of these tickers this morning, what I'm thinking is"
"1767240","1772520"," along the same lines as what spot gammas take is. "
"1772840","1779320"," And that is that you had massive hedging on some big tech names."
"1779880","1782600"," Anything that's been beaten down like spy pins."
"1783580","1789820"," Whether you think some of these tickers should go up or not into the new year, you have to"
"1789820","1791280"," understand that it doesn't matter. "
"1791280","1795340"," What matters is that the hedging is coming off on these tickers."
"1795920","1801240"," And as they approach the or the expiration for these tickers, you're going to see a lot of them"
"1801240","1802040"," start to squeeze."
"1802600","1807240"," So my assumption is this is a play by banks and hedge funds knowing that these tickers are going to"
"1807240","1807500"," squeeze. "
"1808840","1811160"," I know there was some hedging on AMD as well."
"1811680","1813320"," So you've got some resistance here."
"1813440","1815120"," It looks like it right at 150. "
"1815120","1821920"," But once if you break through 150, 152, and maybe even 155, it's clear sky above."
"1822120","1822760"," And this is the play."
"1823200","1824560"," This is the attempt at a play. "
"1825780","1829700"," So your real wall is at 161, 65."
"1830760","1836020"," So AMD has a fairly good chance of a huge print coming into it."
"1841230","1842850"," AFRM, I'll look them up next. "
"1843410","1844210"," Let's do AFRM."
"1844210","1849210"," And I'll do a Tesla thing once more for you."
"1850550","1856980"," So let's just keep a look on Tesla here for a brief moment and then we'll kick out of Tesla. "
"1857500","1860120"," But you guys want to know where support and resistance is, right?"
"1865500","1870320"," You can see that the buyer is trying to wear out the sellers at 1100."
"1872580","1877200"," You've got some major support at 1080, minor support at 1070."
"1877880","1881460"," And then you've got these real buyers down below here at 1050. "
"1882360","1884800"," You've got major resistance above at 1100."
"1885420","1886440"," But that doesn't mean much."
"1886720","1891200"," If the hedge wall comes off and enough bid comes into the market, you'll see us break through this"
"1891200","1891660"," no problem. "
"1892020","1894120"," This is minor above at 11, 10, too."
"1894320","1896160"," So the expectation I would think."
"1896460","1901160"," So if I was going to expect what expectations on Tesla for the rest of the week, it's going to"
"1901160","1901500"," go high. "
"1902060","1905140"," You're talking about banks that are long Tesla."
"1905140","1908980"," And they want to take profit before end of year."
"1909420","1911060"," So where do they take that profit at?"
"1911200","1915880"," Is it something where, let's say on Friday, they get up to 1200 again and they can call more"
"1915880","1916340"," profit?"
"1916900","1919440"," It wouldn't shock me to see a play like that. "
"1920240","1923300"," And to see retail bulls be scared of that trade."
"1924380","1925920"," Because I'd be afraid as well, right?"
"1926120","1927260"," Do you really think we're going to 1200?"
"1928320","1931700"," Before end of week, I can understand that feeling, that fear."
"1935440","1938140"," This is this is what I've told you guys that I've had. "
"1938240","1940480"," I show it at times when we trade like this."
"1940800","1944620"," If we grind up from now into Friday, it's not always the best."
"1945000","1947700"," It's not the it's not. "
"1948860","1952420"," Whenever we grind, you don't know where the top is sometimes."
"1953060","1958600"," So I always like nice firm supports and resistances so I can trade off of those."
"1960880","1963180"," So I don't know what to say on that up for the rest of the week. "
"1963180","1964040"," I'm long right now."
"1964180","1964880"," I don't think I'm selling."
"1965060","1969460"," I think I'm going to hold and keep adding calls into or stay with my plan, which is to keep"
"1969460","1973660"," adding calls into Friday on any support that we find. "
"1974020","1975620"," Any kind of weakness in the market."
"1975880","1980280"," And then I'll just add every day dirt cheap puts as protection."
"1983210","1987210"," And you can see right here, we bounced right off 472.80. We called this out earlier. "
"1987850","1989670"," That was your buy in and you can see we're going higher."
"1989670","1994970"," Once again, we're at 473.45. You guys got that call out from me, right?"
"1995270","2000870"," You guys heard that when I said all the buyers at 472.80. And you can see right here."
"2001350","2002290"," This is a firm bounce. "
"2002610","2004950"," So if you're a bear out there, what is this right here?"
"2005070","2006010"," This is bullish."
"2006510","2007190"," That's all this is."
"2007590","2011450"," Nothing here is telling you that we're not bullish this morning on the spy. "
"2012030","2017670"," I want you to know that most people know that the spy has the potential to rip to 480."
"2018550","2023490"," That the call wall has been raised and that we have major hedging coming off on Friday."
"2023990","2026670"," So all signs point towards a very bullish. "
"2029820","2031260"," Yeah, AMD is weird."
"2031780","2039320"," So you're talking about 1.3 million buyers versus 800, 900,000 sellers."
"2040060","2042360"," Or maybe it was less with 680,000 sellers. "
"2042860","2044440"," So someone knows what's up with AMD."
"2044900","2046420"," There's something definitely going on."
"2047159","2049260"," Okay, so we're going to look at Amazon next. "
"2059179","2062440"," Yeah, so that 472.80 was a no brainer right for a buy."
"2062880","2064920"," You guys should be printing right now just off that."
"2066260","2067920"," That was a no brainer buying that. "
"2072290","2073830"," That's a gorgeous chart right there."
"2073949","2074310"," Look at that."
"2074989","2077310"," Slams down inside and it rips right higher. "
"2077969","2081870"," How many of you guys thought that was going to come flying back down for a cash gap close?"
"2082570","2083090"," Because it's not."
"2083810","2087310"," There's nothing implying that we're going to close that we're going to close."
"2087449","2090000"," Matter of fact, we opened right where we closed yesterday, basically. "
"2090000","2092920"," When you could call this in some respect."
"2093659","2100380"," If you look at Friday's close, when we sold down actually the last five minutes, you can see we"
"2100380","2102540"," opened right where that sell down was."
"2103300","2105360"," So there's nothing to close on Friday. "
"2105700","2108160"," It's clear skies to 475."
"2109540","2112260"," That's our first and this resistance above here 475."
"2113640","2117840"," So you guys want to firm target for getting out of your calls. "
"2120000","2124220"," Look for a pin strike at 474.94 this morning."
"2125680","2127980"," And even at that pin strike."
"2128900","2129660"," It's weak. "
"2129940","2132120"," This isn't really a wall at 474."
"2133540","2136400"," And not only that at 477."
"2137480","2138460"," It's a weak wall. "
"2138860","2141300"," So there's nothing we got clear skies to 480."
"2141780","2143620"," It could go even higher than that, believe it or not."
"2144320","2146540"," Unless there's something that's that we're hit. "
"2146660","2147440"," That's hidden right now."
"2147440","2149780"," We could have some hidden sellers that we don't know about."
"2150400","2152580"," Maybe the real sellers are at 475. "
"2153900","2156280"," Where they're just not showing themselves at this moment."
"2156800","2158520"," Because this is a weak wall above here."
"2159300","2161900"," So I don't know if maybe they come out of nowhere. "
"2162080","2165920"," You want to pay attention to this as we get closer to 475."
"2166860","2169120"," Because it looks like clear skies even above."
"2169720","2172100"," Even above 480, let's look at the clear skies. "
"2172820","2178300"," That would imply that not only we're going to make all 10 highs, but we're going to go and break"
"2178300","2179220"," out of one of these."
"2180420","2182240"," These expanding megaphones."
"2184310","2193150"," And you can see we broke right through resistance at 473.80. Are you guys all making money?"
"2193770","2196150"," Hope that printer is going bare this morning, boys. "
"2199490","2199970"," Snap."
"2200350","2201610"," I'll just snap next for you."
"2224320","2224980"," Let's take a look at. "
"2232590","2234630"," Let's take a look at Amazon this morning."
"2247880","2249940"," Amazon is looking very tasty as well."
"2249940","2254880"," So your major support on Amazon is 3420. "
"2255800","2258420"," Your next support is 3400."
"2258940","2262600"," You can see that there was some rejection above here."
"2263080","2269380"," They ate through sellers at 3450. "
"2269560","2272000"," They took out a pretty nice chunk of sellers here."
"2272900","2276220"," But you can see the buyers step right in here at 3420."
"2278190","2280510"," And you've got more supply down below. "
"2281250","2284170"," And you can see it's a tight trading range on spy."
"2284730","2288690"," So maybe you're a buyer at 3400 and a seller at 3460."
"2289430","2297610"," If you wanted to do like a five or 10 minute trade, you could definitely take it here at 3420,"
"2297850","2302090"," 3.45. Take a look closer look. "
"2303250","2309550"," 34 point or 3423.45 and hold to 3460."
"2309550","2311290"," It's a pretty good rip right there."
"2312310","2313270"," 30 point rip. "
"2316310","2317630"," You all will see what?"
"2317850","2318130"," Snap."
"2319490","2321010"," I'll do snap for you next."
"2322450","2323930"," Some birds today, boys. "
"2325310","2326650"," Let me take a look at my calls."
"2327490","2328010"," Oh, baby."
"2330810","2331830"," 480 is going to print. "
"2337980","2338420"," Unsubscribe."
"2338740","2339740"," We're going to do snap next."
"2344050","2344870"," Yeah, we're going to see. "
"2344950","2345690"," We're going to see 480."
"2346950","2348550"," If I had the gas, we see 480."
"2351820","2355620"," So get some 1231 480 sees. "
"2359500","2361540"," Look at my positions here."
"2362080","2362620"," Oh, yeah."
"2363160","2364400"," That's what I'm talking about. "
"2367350","2368450"," It's crazy too."
"2368610","2369450"," I wound up buying."
"2370090","2373350"," I bought 477 478. "
"2375110","2379210"," I bought December 29, 477, 478."
"2380130","2381690"," debit call spreads."
"2382250","2383290"," I think they cost. "
"2385310","2387830"," Six cents or something like that."
"2388750","2390090"," They were like six cents."
"2390330","2391010"," They cost there. "
"2391290","2393470"," They now cost 22 cents."
"2402280","2402980"," Which is wild."
"2412690","2414630"," It's interesting when you buy stuff cheap. "
"2415450","2417770"," You don't really care as much when they burn."
"2418450","2422110"," And when they print, they print so big that it doesn't matter which one's burn."
"2425490","2426370"," Let's look at the spy. "
"2452210","2455450"," There's some selling here, but we've got some buyers stepping in as well."
"2455450","2460890"," This was that minor support level we talked about at 473 78."
"2462110","2462910"," Or 90. "
"2463110","2465170"," I don't remember what we called for this pen strike above here."
"2466410","2468890"," You got your real wall above here at 475."
"2488710","2492970"," If you had purchase calls on Friday, this would be a nice place to take some profit. "
"2495390","2500310"," If you're looking to rebuy back in, if there's any weakness, you're looking for."
"2502510","2508710"," A rebuy at 472.91. We're going to be looking this morning."
"2509210","2512150"," Let's say we have more sellers than buyers here. "
"2513630","2518510"," You're going to look for this yellow line to firm up down here and start to turn red."
"2518970","2520650"," You don't want to see it turn blue or anything."
"2521510","2526010"," Otherwise, you'll see that localized support level disappear. "
"2526930","2532090"," It would then go lower down to, I think we called it earlier, 470."
"2533010","2534550"," Yeah, let's take a look at that."
"2535450","2543930"," So the smart money right now is at 469.80. But see how this blue line has disappeared or this"
"2543930","2545550"," red line has now become blue. "
"2545990","2548310"," And that's because the buyers have moved higher."
"2548970","2550770"," The buyers know that we're going higher."
"2551550","2560390"," And so they're now providing supply here at 472.96. So does anything about that look bearish to you"
"2560390","2560750"," out there?"
"2560750","2562030"," You guys see that?"
"2562690","2566030"," That the supply was down at 470. "
"2566530","2567750"," It has now moved higher."
"2568050","2570750"," So the smart money is no longer at 470."
"2570930","2574890"," It's at 472.96 or let me see if I get that right. "
"2575650","2585580"," The smart money is now above that 472.80. Yeah, facts about buying"
"2585580","2586220"," a cheap, right?"
"2587200","2593660"," One thing bothering me is that the VIX is up harder for spy to go up with the VIX up."
"2594480","2596720"," No, that is con."
"2597060","2606800"," So I've trade VIX a lot and it is not uncommon to see the VIX high and the spy"
"2606800","2607520"," to go up. "
"2609410","2610510"," It is not uncommon."
"2611530","2613570"," And you can see it right here that we are up."
"2615190","2617790"," The market is up and the VIX is up. "
"2618390","2620170"," So you can't say that doesn't happen."
"2635360","2636700"," Let's take a look."
"2640510","2642910"," And you can see the pinch 15222. "
"2644170","2645590"," Oh, yeah, that was in the 23rd."
"2645930","2646410"," Oh, no."
"2646690","2647030"," I don't know what. "
"2647230","2647770"," Yeah, the VIX."
"2648050","2648310"," Oh, no."
"2648470","2649070"," The VIX is down. "
"2651370","2652530"," The VIX is about to crash."
"2653530","2655350"," You're checking the wrong dates here."
"2657860","2660040"," So I'm looking at this morning's VIX and it's down. "
"2660280","2662340"," Not only is it down, but it's looking like it's going to dump."
"2663360","2665800"," So I don't know what we're talking about on the VIX this morning."
"2666740","2669760"," The VIX is looking like it's about to poop itself. "
"2671520","2674040"," I don't know what VIX we're looking at here."
"2675440","2677700"," We're looking at a different VIX than you guys out there."
"2682990","2684290"," IWM is catching a bid. "
"2684450","2685190"," Let's look at the IWM."
"2686810","2688330"," Let's look at the spy real quick."
"2689730","2692550"," Now that it's loaded up, that's beautiful. "
"2693510","2695770"," I actually like the spy this morning."
"2697990","2700650"," You've got some real nice support at 4840."
"2701810","2702930"," 4800 on Snap. "
"2706580","2707460"," I like Snap."
"2707460","2708880"," I like Snap as like a leap."
"2711030","2715070"," All these hedge walls up here at 50 and 55 on Snap. "
"2715310","2716490"," These things are all going to go away."
"2718030","2720690"," You've got a hard walled $60 on Snap."
"2722030","2723090"," I like this play. "
"2723290","2724430"," I like this play as like a spread."
"2725130","2729970"," Just sit in the money spread, like a 48 or a 4050 call spread, date it out."
"2730670","2732450"," You can date them out like summertime. "
"2733090","2735670"," Pick an ER for Snap this summer."
"2735670","2744230"," You'll just catch the wave from interested bulls heading into their ETCR."
"2746090","2748130"," Snap was that weird. "
"2748910","2751950"," You know how Snap dropped, it should have come back."
"2752910","2761210"," This was Snap dropped over the Apple advertising fees and monies."
"2761730","2767590"," All you need on Snap is, if Snap just comes out and says, who cares about this?"
"2767770","2768830"," We're making money another way. "
"2769410","2771070"," It's going to be way back up again, right?"
"2771450","2774250"," Snap will be back at 60, 70 bucks overnight."
"2774750","2775930"," How do you trade that?"
"2776610","2777290"," It's difficult."
"2777710","2785670"," You could actively manage trade and spy where you buy outside of the money calls for $0.10 and keep"
"2785670","2791470"," rebying them over time until it hits because all you need is just one piece of good news and Snap"
"2791470","2793050"," is going to rip all the time highs. "
"2793690","2796150"," That's all you need is just one simple piece of news."
"2796850","2801650"," You can either buy really cheap outside of the money calls until it happens or you could buy some"
"2801650","2803910"," leaps or you could just buy stock."
"2804150","2806870"," 48 bucks for Snap, I want it lower. "
"2807650","2814670"," I'd like to see it down in the high 30s, low 40s, but it's a no-brainer to buy some"
"2814670","2819790"," form of spread and the money spread because you know the news is going to come at some point."
"2820290","2821330"," You just know it's coming."
"2821330","2826210"," Even if it was to dip down into the 30s or 40s, the banks will pick it back up and"
"2826210","2827790"," they'll ride it up to 60 bucks again. "
"2829150","2832050"," If you don't want to miss that train, I like Snap."
"2833590","2836830"," I have a hard time believing that Snap is going to stay down forever."
"2838450","2845040"," It's one of those stocks that got whacked and then didn't come back. "
"2852370","2864360"," So in October of 2020, the banks"
"2864360","2874120"," started to trade Snap when at 28.54. They started trading Snap on in October"
"2874120","2875300"," of 2020."
"2876220","2882750"," We just had this nice bounce above here at $41."
"2886240","2891800"," For 28 bucks back in October of 2020 and now it's at or then it bounced at 42. "
"2892300","2892800"," That's reasonable."
"2893860","2895060"," You can't really."
"2897020","2899880"," I hate Zuckerberg and I hate Snapchat. "
"2901280","2905440"," But at the same time, it's got great numbers."
"2906380","2908880"," So 40 bucks isn't bad."
"2908880","2912380"," I guess I'm being, maybe I'm just being really cheap saying it. "
"2912440","2913420"," I want it in the 30s."
"2913760","2915860"," I want it to like 36 bucks, 38 bucks."
"2917440","2918860"," I'm just cheap sometimes. "
"2919200","2920040"," I shouldn't be that cheap."
"2921240","2922040"," 41 sounds reasonable."
"2928590","2931270"," So you know you've got a wall above at 50 bucks and 51. "
"2932070","2938980"," If you're keeping that trade on Snap, let's check back in with Tesla."
"2941530","2942210"," Same thing."
"2942350","2944250"," You're looking to just be buying dips on Tesla. "
"2945170","2966180"," Dip buying is at 10.80 and 10.70. We're"
"2966180","2968080"," just on the grind here in the spot this morning."
"2975080","2978360"," I'm going to post some live flow for you guys right now on Twitter."
"2979560","2981460"," Miss Fitz catching a bid. "
"2983520","2984520"," Apple the cues."
"2985940","2987920"," You guys can check this stuff out here."
"2988040","2988960"," I'll post this right now. "
"2997840","2999680"," This is just raw flow as it comes in."
"2999680","3013800"," And I'll"
"3013800","3019140"," also give you by the ticker what the most bullish flow is this morning."
"3019400","3021860"," So you can, you can hunt some of these down. "
"3022240","3026200"," If I, so if I post for you this next post, I'm going to post on Twitter."
"3026420","3026580"," Okay."
"3027520","3030700"," And so let's say we're in a bearish context of the day. "
"3032220","3036120"," I'll post for you the top 10 bearish tickers, right?"
"3036680","3040720"," So you might ask, what do you, what do I do with this captain when you post this stuff?"
"3041940","3045320"," What you're looking for is an opening in any of these stocks."
"3046080","3048040"," You're going to, I'm going to post these for you."
"3048140","3052500"," So today I'm posting for you the most bullish stocks out there. "
"3052780","3054420"," This is where the money flow is coming in."
"3054620","3060140"," So go, if you don't have a play that you're in right now, it behoove you to check each one"
"3060140","3066320"," of these tickers, see if they're heading down and maybe they're going to turn, or are any of them"
"3066320","3068180"," at the bottom of a trend channel, right?"
"3068180","3074220"," If we're trending up on these tickers, start to chart them out with simple charts to look for an"
"3074220","3075680"," entry in any of these tickers."
"3076220","3083940"," Normally I won't post this list until any time between 10 and 12 o'clock because the initial flow"
"3083940","3087100"," in the morning at 9.30 is sometimes blurry. "
"3088180","3096440"," Often times that flow is only intended to print tickers that had buyers from the previous day, the"
"3096440","3097340"," previous trading day."
"3098040","3103620"," But once we're at this 10, 30, 11, 30 hour, it starts to firm up where you see the real"
"3103620","3104040"," money at."
"3105680","3108800"," Yeah, we're at 4.74. How much you guys want to bet?"
"3108940","3109420"," We hit 480. "
"3113470","3114330"," What you guys want bet?"
"3117510","3118570"," I think everybody knows what's up."
"3123390","3124970"," We're going to start to squeeze here on spy."
"3130760","3133180"," We've got clear skies just so you guys know. "
"3134420","3141560"," Looks like you got some some sellers at 4.75, but not for the number of buyers we have."
"3146730","3149370"," It wouldn't surprise me to see 4.78, 480."
"3172910","3199350"," Let's go look at"
"3199350","3199510"," this. "
"3242220","3251430"," The only resistance on spy is at 4.75. You're going to see it start squeezing here."
"3264430","3270310"," Now you saw us just bounce here at 4.74.37, but you need to pay attention to what's going"
"3270310","3270710"," on here."
"3270710","3272270"," There's no ricochet here. "
"3272610","3274070"," All the buyers are stepping in."
"3274170","3274830"," You can see them."
"3276390","3282870"," Buyers are stepping in at 4.74.17. The liquidity is here to meet up with these sellers above. "
"3283930","3289370"," We have sellers at 4.74.50. This is where it gets dangerous for a bear."
"3290070","3292710"," This is where you can you can lose a lot of money."
"3293430","3294330"," If you're short the market. "
"3296110","3304890"," We know that market shorts have been short since when the market shorts have been here."
"3305510","3311030"," So at 4.74.86. We're tagging right now all time highs."
"3311510","3312990"," So here's my question to you. "
"3313450","3315190"," What's your thesis out there?"
"3315630","3318850"," Your thesis is, hey, we looked above, right?"
"3319630","3326730"," We checked all time all time highs when back on 11.22. We checked it again when back on 12 "
"3326730","3329970",".8. We checked it again on 12.13, right?"
"3329970","3335430"," Then we checked it one more time back on 12.16. Rejections every single time."
"3335770","3338690"," So now we're at all time highs once again out there."
"3339070","3340650"," So what's the plan now?"
"3341210","3344450"," Do we go back down a check at this point down below?"
"3345250","3346170"," I doubt it. "
"3346490","3348430"," I doubt that we go back down right now."
"3348550","3356250"," We've tagged three times on lower levels down here at 4.49, 4.48.9 and 4.51.30. 3"
"3356250","3358770"," times means wet what?"
"3359050","3359590"," We're going up."
"3360030","3361730"," So I don't know. "
"3361830","3362670"," I'm long right here."
"3363730","3364350"," I'm long."
"3364630","3368610"," I'm having a hard time believing that we're done at this point. "
"3368830","3373410"," Now, if you're a bear out there and you think we're done, then this is the time for you to"
"3373410","3374330"," short the market, right?"
"3374530","3375250"," This is where we're at."
"3375590","3377090"," We've done this how many times now?"
"3377390","3379530"," Four, five times where we've looked below."
"3380230","3383390"," We've looked above and I'm not seeing it. "
"3383770","3385470"," What I see is buyers in the market."
"3385470","3388690"," So I'm not seeing any flow coming in right now."
"3388810","3389170"," That's negative. "
"3389630","3391250"," I'll take a look and see if I can find anything."
"3392030","3396590"," If you're a bull right now, this would be a point for you to at least buy some protection."
"3397310","3402590"," You could buy yourself some puts that expire on Wednesday, some dirt cheap penny puts. "
"3403350","3410190"," You know, throw a hundred bucks out there on some, on some penny puts, but I'm sorry."
"3410370","3412610"," I mean, this, this always ends in resolution."
"3413370","3418570"," You have to remember even the last wedge that we were in, ended in upside resolution. "
"3419490","3421390"," And we're here again right now."
"3421790","3424630"," So where do, where does this resolution take us?"
"3425570","3430850"," I'm assuming if you're a bear out there, you think the market's going to crash right now today at"
"3430850","3431670"," this moment, right?"
"3431830","3432530"," That's what's going to happen."
"3433010","3436190"," But in reality, this market moves up. "
"3436310","3437410"," This market trades up."
"3437830","3441070"," Even when we trade down, it always resolves to the upside."
"3441830","3445490"," The crash in 2007 still resolved to the upside. "
"3445490","3449070"," The March 2020 crash still resolved to the upside."
"3449570","3452590"," Our market going back to its start resolves to the upside."
"3453050","3454150"," We're a forward looking market. "
"3454470","3455050"," That's what we do."
"3455830","3457130"," We're the leader of the free world."
"3457610","3462810"," So my expectation is that when we've looked below three times, that we're not going to be looking"
"3462810","3464450"," below again as we move forward. "
"3465730","3469210"," You guys getting all that out there in, in, in YouTube land?"
"3470650","3471210"," Exactly."
"3471770","3472990"," There are no quad tops."
"3472990","3475690"," There's no such thing as a quad top. "
"3476830","3478130"," Omicron is a nothing burger."
"3478310","3479470"," That was all bullshit."
"3479930","3482770"," Like the news this weekend was all bullshit. "
"3483270","3486030"," It was, it was being directed at certain people."
"3486370","3490370"," It had nothing to do with the message that we were going to all die or anything like that."
"3491770","3495830"," The obfuscation of the news right now when it comes to COVID is, is horrible. "
"3496350","3496810"," It's horrible."
"3497070","3497870"," And I'm a massacre."
"3498090","3498570"," I wear a mask. "
"3498570","3505870"," And it's just that all credibility is being thrown up the window right now in the news."
"3508990","3511070"," Yeah, we'll have a, we'll have a pullback out there."
"3513490","3515130"," Is Uber looking good for the weekly wrap?"
"3515270","3516230"," I'll tell you what right now. "
"3516530","3518690"," If you're a bear, watch your ass out there right now."
"3520190","3522670"," Honestly, you can see the buyers stepping in here."
"3522730","3523950"," This is not like before. "
"3524890","3526350"," We know what happened."
"3526990","3527970"," We know before."
"3528170","3533070"," So we know that when we, when we hit all time highs and tops, the past three that we've hit,"
"3533810","3535270"," that it was firm rejection. "
"3535970","3539530"," We saw weakness right when we, when we came to all time highs."
"3540770","3546630"," It's 10 30 in the morning on a Monday morning in a low liquidity environment."
"3547370","3549490"," What does that mean for you out there?"
"3549990","3556590"," It means that the price has been placed here for a reason not to get rejected, but to actually go"
"3556590","3560870"," up at this point that we know the call wall is above at 480 now. "
"3562130","3564750"," So all signs point towards us trading higher."
"3566690","3568030"," So be cautious out there."
"3568270","3572790"," Be cautious of your, if you're a bear out there, if you're a bully, I want you to be, I"
"3572790","3579210"," want you to start thinking about what we talked about last night on that zoom call about how to"
"3579210","3580130"," properly hedge, right?"
"3580570","3585010"," That you can buy yourself some March, put spreads that are deep in the money. "
"3585010","3587710"," I told you about buying."
"3587710","3595190"," If you were, if you were locally in the next one to three, one to three expiry date, no, with"
"3595190","3598810"," daily Opax is coming up that you buy dirt cheap penny puts."
"3599290","3601630"," You've got two options there and how to hedge yourself. "
"3602090","3604810"," They're dirt cheap, even though you're running along right now."
"3607980","3609240"," Let's take a look at those calls."
"3609440","3611520"," So I talked to you guys about these calls, right?"
"3612200","3616140"," Those calls, I called these calls out to you this morning before the open. "
"3616140","3617300"," What did I say?"
"3618600","3624140"," Spy, 1231, 480c, 26 cents, I think I said."
"3624620","3626480"," They're now worth 62 cents."
"3626900","3630060"," We still have four more days until the weekend, right?"
"3635490","3637510"," Bro, you don't get COVID get. "
"3637830","3639530"," Oh, I have the COVID."
"3639730","3640570"," Oh, no, hutch."
"3641150","3641190"," Yeah. "
"3641730","3645630"," But even though you've got big, the Omicron, the Omicron is not as dangerous."
"3646530","3648570"," If anything, I hope I get the Omicron."
"3648570","3655810"," If I get any of the variants, I'd want the Omicron over the delta or the original alpha strain of"
"3655810","3656810"," COVID. "
"3657910","3658990"," I'm triple-vax."
"3659150","3660730"," I do all the shit that I'm supposed to be doing."
"3662250","3665350"," But I'm telling you what, I'm not locking up for anybody ever again. "
"3665490","3666310"," I'm done with lockups."
"3666690","3668050"," I did my part for two years."
"3668710","3672310"," If you guys couldn't figure it out out there, if anybody from the government's listening right now,"
"3672810","3673830"," I did my part. "
"3673990","3675150"," I did everything you told me to do."
"3675770","3679230"," And if there's anybody out here that's not going to lock up anymore, it's going to be anybody that"
"3679230","3680930"," did what they're supposed to do for two straight years."
"3681330","3682830"," We're coming in year two right now. "
"3683350","3683970"," So I'm sorry."
"3684110","3684830"," I'm opening up."
"3685290","3686730"," I'm out there living my life now. "
"3688920","3689320"," Yeah."
"3689980","3690940"," I'm out there."
"3691080","3691600"," I'm out there. "
"3691760","3693100"," I'm hiking, biking, skiing."
"3693420","3694260"," I'm doing all that stuff."
"3694840","3695820"," I'm enjoying my life. "
"3696040","3696500"," That's what it is."
"3696600","3696900"," I'm sorry."
"3697620","3698040"," I did it. "
"3698260","3699240"," I did what you wanted me to do."
"3699680","3704560"," My youngest daughter is like, I have to, I'm taking her out right now to spend time with kids"
"3704560","3706800"," because she was locked up for two years."
"3706800","3709860"," I mean, all these kids out there are getting wrecked, right?"
"3710040","3714520"," You've got some of these kids are in school, but a whole lot of kids were doing homeschool for two"
"3714520","3714980"," straight years. "
"3715500","3717020"," You just can't do this to kids."
"3717020","3719220"," You have to get out there at some point and take on some risk."
"3719700","3721520"," And I've, all my kids are vax now. "
"3721720","3722820"," So I'm sorry."
"3722940","3725200"," I can't, I can't stay inside with my kids anymore."
"3726060","3728260"," And then you're blowing us up this weekend with that news. "
"3728840","3729640"," You guys are out there."
"3729760","3733960"," They're out there doing this crazy news cycle over the weekend, trying to get everybody scared."
"3734540","3735160"," I'm like, you're kidding me. "
"3735160","3736420"," I just locked up for two years."
"3736860","3739460"," You got to be shitting me trying to put that news out over the weekend."
"3739960","3740420"," No offense. "
"3740900","3742920"," I'm hoping that piss anybody off out there in Twitter verse."
"3744460","3750620"," So we've got support firming up at 474.30. You can see the buyers are down below here."
"3750900","3756980"," You guys want to know where the bid is, the bids at 474.34. You've got some minor support below"
"3756980","3762520"," at 473.50. But if there is any weakness that comes in the market this morning, you're looking to"
"3762520","3764900"," buy in again now at a much higher level, right?"
"3765260","3766300"," We saw the buyers move. "
"3766420","3771140"," The smart money moved from 470 to 472.90. They're all on board."
"3771280","3772160"," They got the kids on board."
"3772360","3775380"," They're taking a ride down to 10 to 10. "
"3775720","3780560"," So if you've got major buyers at 472, that's the question, right?"
"3781940","3783760"," You've got buyers that stepped in at 472."
"3783820","3784880"," Where do they want to take profit?"
"3785560","3786800"," Because we know they're not us."
"3787280","3790200"," We know us will take profit for a couple of points, right?"
"3790620","3791280"," We've got 20 points. "
"3791480","3792460"," Some will take our profit and run."
"3792460","3794800"," Banks want profit on 100 points."
"3795240","3796760"," They want profit on 200 points. "
"3797160","3799660"," They're not in it for just five points or 20 points."
"3803010","3803450"," Yeah."
"3803510","3805070"," You think you might have a Mcron or Henry?"
"3809210","3809650"," Yeah. "
"3809850","3814850"," The overcrowd is if I could catch COVID, it'd probably be the overcrowd version of it."
"3816870","3817310"," Yeah."
"3817530","3819410"," It messed my, it messed my kids up. "
"3819770","3820650"," It's unforgivable."
"3820890","3826990"," I'm telling you my, my, my daughter is like, it's, this has been devastating to our country."
"3827590","3829390"," And you know, I get you want to fight it. "
"3829390","3833570"," And I was, I was, I was on board for that fight, but you know, you've got the two years"
"3833570","3833950"," or down."
"3834290","3838490"," You know that it gave time for our hospitals to be able to treat this at this point."
"3838950","3843090"," You guys out there all have to know that you have to do, you have to do to protect yourselves"
"3843090","3844570"," and get through life. "
"3844570","3849230"," But you know, when you do your part for two years, how much more can you ask at that point?"
"3849770","3851730"," At some point, the risk comes on, right?"
"3852150","3857070"," At some point as just a citizen of the world, you have to absorb some risk."
"3857690","3859510"," So that's what we have to do as a country."
"3859970","3861430"," That's what other nations have to do. "
"3861850","3864250"," You can't lock up for four or five, ten years."
"3864290","3865290"," It just isn't going to happen."
"3865850","3868690"," You know, it's not going to happen at this point. "
"3869590","3871490"," You can't forget to live 100%."
"3874450","3876010"," Yeah, it's all, I'm all done with it."
"3876090","3877150"," I'm all done with the COVID thing. "
"3877510","3878770"," I'm all done with it."
"3879030","3880110"," I mean, I'll still wear a mask."
"3880170","3883030"," I'll still socially distance do all the right stuff. "
"3883310","3886530"," But you can't tell us, you can't be fair mongering anymore."
"3886810","3887510"," You just can't."
"3887510","3890430"," Fair mongering is out the window at this point. "
"3891110","3891770"," It's done."
"3892050","3892770"," We're done with it."
"3893330","3894570"," You can't do this to kids. "
"3894850","3896170"," I can't express."
"3898090","3901410"," And even when I take my kids anywhere right now, nothing's the same."
"3902010","3903070"," There's no joy out there. "
"3903210","3904410"," There's no happiness out there."
"3904890","3906170"," We're heading into a long winter."
"3907010","3910070"," So you've already got seasonal depression for a lot of people out there. "
"3910770","3915030"," You got, you got, you got to pick a chin up at some point and carry on."
"3919230","3919670"," Yeah."
"3922410","3926930"," 100 degree fever, sore throat, achy, slight cough, nothing a little pseudo-fed and coffee can't"
"3926930","3927110"," fix. "
"3931990","3933590"," Time to hedge life got to live."
"3933910","3934850"," Yeah, there's that point."
"3935450","3936150"," There's that point. "
"3936430","3937350"," You know, I did my part."
"3937690","3938990"," So I did my part."
"3939590","3940450"," I did my part. "
"3940590","3942810"," I think most of the most Americans have done their part."
"3943410","3945230"," So what do you do at this point?"
"3945590","3947370"," You have to start to put some risk on life."
"3953150","3955070"," I do want you guys to see here. "
"3955070","3958990"," There is some growing seller and resistance above here."
"3959450","3963570"," You may want to consider taking some profit."
"3966960","3969020"," Let's take a look and see where we're at here. "
"3969560","3975380"," So it's not concerning here at this point on the spy, but you are seeing a pushback from bears."
"3978050","3980930"," What you guys tell you guys all listening to me out there."
"3981030","4020770"," Make a"
"4020770","4021390"," trade here. "
"4025300","4030560"," So there is some resistance building above it."
"4031300","4035540"," 4.75, 4.75, 4.75 specifically."
"4036540","4038860"," You can see here we had two touches above. "
"4039440","4043580"," This is a moment where you could take some profit off the table."
"4044760","4048700"," This might be a moment to think about picking up some cheap hedges."
"4049500","4052480"," It's not that we can't break through and trade to 480. "
"4053420","4053780"," It's not."
"4054000","4054880"," This is one of those moments."
"4055220","4059000"," You guys are always hearing me out there talking about how I trade, right?"
"4059000","4065360"," I hear all this bullshit on Twitter where all these bullshitters are talking about what they trade"
"4066200","4072260"," and how bad ass they are out there, but yet they can't put their money where their mouth is. "
"4072500","4075640"," So I'm telling you right now, you guys know me and how I trade."
"4076120","4081900"," This is one of those moments where we're at some resistance right now where you'd want to start"
"4081900","4082740"," thinking about a hedge."
"4083100","4085060"," You take a little bit of profit off the table. "
"4085060","4090600"," You let the banks do the work for you to break through 4.75 for us to go to 480."
"4091080","4092700"," You guys follow me with my videos."
"4093020","4097080"," You guys follow me live here on Twitter and on YouTube. "
"4097779","4099500"," So what do we do at this point, right?"
"4099680","4101399"," We let the banks do the work for us."
"4101840","4103040"," You guys know that, right?"
"4106960","4108279"," Our arc is actually down."
"4108620","4110840"," Yeah, I'll look at IWM and arc right now. "
"4110920","4111300"," Okay, guys."
"4113300","4115120"," This is a time for you to take profit."
"4115120","4120029"," You've got support on Tesla. "
"4121870","4131729"," The thing about Tesla is you've got support at 1107 and down at 1070, but you've got some"
"4131729","4133609"," big, big resistance above."
"4133930","4135470"," These bears never give up through the."
"4136010","4137370"," These bears are just relentless. "
"4138950","4142750"," Relentless sellers, 1120 sellers, 1150 sellers."
"4143750","4145090"," We'll look at IWM next."
"4148300","4149060"," Goddamn bears. "
"4149500","4150000"," Go offense."
"4151760","4153020"," I like the bears."
"4162830","4164189"," Now the VIX isn't up. "
"4164350","4165689"," Someone was saying the VIX is up."
"4165790","4166410"," It wasn't up."
"4167029","4167770"," It was down. "
"4169890","4171130"," Pull down some spy."
"4171689","4172069"," What do we got?"
"4172189","4175990"," Does Joe want to buy in the Joe Harper not buy in last week?"
"4176050","4177510"," And now he wants a dip to buy."
"4181319","4182500"," Yeah, take some profit. "
"4182779","4186100"," Take the money and run and then jump back in above, right?"
"4186100","4191260"," So once you with the grind keeps taking place on the spy, right?"
"4191420","4192560"," It's time for you to take profit."
"4192920","4193960"," Call some of that money."
"4194440","4195620"," And then you. "
"4196460","4197560"," You jump above."
"4197820","4199280"," I like the IWM trade, by the way."
"4199360","4200340"," I mean, I don't know. "
"4200340","4200700"," I don't know."
"4200720","4202900"," I want to see."
"4203040","4205040"," I want to see 230 by an end of week. "
"4209510","4212150"," So you guys know out there you've got some nice support."
"4212530","4214590"," You've got supply down below it."
"4215070","4216090"," Let's take a look. "
"4217550","4218030"," Support."
"4218030","4223270"," You'll see buyers at 221.96. On spy."
"4224230","4225630"," And you've got clear skies above. "
"4226350","4231070"," I mean, in all reality, there's if the if you wanted to know what the trade is in my view,"
"4231790","4234030"," it's IWM to 230."
"4237450","4238630"," It's a no brainer."
"4238930","4243210"," Put some time on some spreads for 230 on IWM. "
"4245130","4246830"," That trade is still on."
"4247750","4251170"," And why bother picking stocks that are going to be."
"4252870","4255490"," The shortage trade or the. "
"4257550","4259130"," The inflation trade."
"4259250","4261930"," You don't need to just pick IWM and it should go."
"4262150","4263970"," It should at some point go back to 230. "
"4264530","4266170"," I like the IWM trade."
"4267570","4274070"," You've got some seller or sellers above some resistance above at two, two, three point one zero."
"4274750","4279210"," In all reality on IWM, just buy some spreads that are one to three months out in the money. "
"4280030","4283950"," And if you've ever had a chance to grab, I grabbed some, I think a grandma calls it 212."
"4284950","4285930"," Something like that."
"4286250","4286410"," So. "
"4291900","4294200"," Oh, you got some of that bird this morning, Joe."
"4294940","4296400"," Did you get some of that burr?"
"4301770","4303310"," Joe got some burr this morning."
"4310080","4311560"," Joe got some burr. "
"4312460","4313840"," Yeah, Joe got some burr."
"4315210","4316850"," Take your money and run."
"4322540","4324180"," All right, let's see. "
"4328900","4330800"," Y'all taking your money and running this morning."
"4331440","4332360"," You're all taking profit."
"4335410","4338450"," Let's take a look and see what other tickers you guys want me to look up. "
"4338930","4340650"," You guys want me to look at a firm, right?"
"4340990","4341330"," XPI."
"4341850","4342210"," I love it."
"4342430","4343910"," I love the XPI trade. "
"4347840","4348460"," Look at XPI."
"4355330","4360090"," Someone tell a counts blown up that we're looking at."
"4360090","4362030"," That XPI right now. "
"4362150","4364390"," I know that he'd be interested in seeing this one."
"4376920","4380820"," A counts blown up has made some real money for people out there."
"4382780","4385760"," That Twitter handle, that guy has been trading like a monster. "
"4388120","4388980"," Straight monster."
"4391160","4394100"," I mean, you guys want to take a screenshot of something badass?"
"4395040","4397140"," Just look at how gorgeous that is right there."
"4399260","4404340"," You can see right here, all these sellers are just being wrecked right now on the spy. "
"4404340","4405600"," That's a gorgeous chart."
"4421620","4423480"," Just grinding right now on XPI."
"4425540","4428000"," Let's see where we're looking at now. "
"4433470","4436590"," XPI is looking for resolution either to the upper downside."
"4437970","4443330"," You've got a steady supply of buyers at $114.80. Let's see."
"4443470","4444790"," Let's see if we can get some harder numbers here. "
"4447450","4456870"," Buyers at $114.82. More buyers at $115.05. You've got a resolution trade here on"
"4456870","4459050"," IVF or XPI."
"4459810","4460570"," Let's see."
"4460770","4469210"," $115.32, but you still have sellers above right at $115.78. You've got a wall at $115.99 and"
"4469210","4476370"," it won $16.25. There's not much to say on XPI this morning. "
"4477270","4480330"," I'm not seeing a wall higher or lower on XPI."
"4480330","4482590"," Behind the gas it's going to trade sideways."
"4482990","4484590"," Let's get some charts on it. "
"4489510","4491590"," I think I charted out XPI last week."
"4496960","4499760"," Last Sunday we charted out XPI."
"4500820","4502540"," It went up what?"
"4503540","4510310"," Last Sunday on the 19th we charted XPI and we went up. "
"4511670","4516650"," I think XPI was up 7% last week or something like that."
"4518540","4521100"," You guys are wondering if it's going to go back up again I guess."
"4524340","4525160"," That's the question. "
"4526940","4531080"," Let's look and see if we have any flow on XPI so I can let you guys know what's up"
"4531080","4531660"," with XPI."
"4539610","4541310"," There's no flow on it today."
"4542550","4545570"," I will look into last week to see if anything came in. "
"4561550","4569910"," Last week on XPI on December 23rd someone bought a 1231."
"4572990","4577750"," 115c for 300,000 on the 21st."
"4578090","4584870"," Someone bought a 118c and another 118c for a million bucks. "
"4585510","4587990"," Expiring on the 21st of January."
"4590960","4594620"," So that if I have to assume I don't see anything on XPI this morning."
"4595280","4599140"," If you're in an XPI trade it might just be a matter of waiting. "
"4603070","4605670"," It looks like the money flow is elsewhere today."
"4608280","4611540"," This is some nice support building here on the spy."
"4612200","4620120"," Looks like the buyers are stepping up to 474, 47450 and 47461. "
"4621660","4624560"," So I'd be a buyer once again down below."
"4624720","4628900"," I'm straight cashing right now just so you guys know I sold my spy positions."
"4628900","4634320"," And I'm looking to reenter right now at 474. "
"4635180","4636580"," So we can get down to 474."
"4637040","4638160"," I'm going to take another trade this morning."
"4647850","4650130"," Let's look and see what we got going on here. "
"4651010","4653070"," We've got any sneaky Pete's going on."
"4659600","4660380"," Yeah, that's crazy."
"4660740","4667920"," Those 460Ps that were like $1.13 for Monday for the 3rd, January 3rd. "
"4668000","4669720"," They're now down to 46 cents."
"4669720","4673320"," So those are starting to become."
"4674260","4675420"," More tempting. "
"4676060","4679660"," If I really want to see them at like 20, 30 cents."
"4680160","4684740"," So when we talked yesterday and zoom about, you know, keeping an eye on."
"4686540","4688340"," Option pricing, right?"
"4688800","4690420"," Not just the interest in them. "
"4690660","4696460"," And you know that for 60 P or 465 P or 470 P."
"4696460","4698780"," When you were when your whole numbers."
"4699260","4701880"," If we move in the direction that we're anticipating."
"4702340","4704800"," That those will be popular strikes, right?"
"4705120","4707360"," So I'm keeping an eye on 460 P."
"4707740","4712380"," I'm keeping an eye on 470 P as we had into the end of this week. "
"4713040","4715480"," Uh, dated for January 3rd."
"4716980","4719160"," And yeah, so 460 P."
"4719440","4723460"," If you could get those down to like 20, 30 cents and the buyer all day long."
"4726930","4729150"," If I get 470 P down to. "
"4729990","4735570"," I mean, it's possible if we keep, if we went up to 480, the 470s would then be worth."
"4736410","4738290"," 40 30 40 cents, something like that."
"4739370","4742350"," But you see how you keep your eyes on the opposite trade. "
"4742750","4745170"," If you're a bully, you're always watching that put trade."
"4745550","4749250"," You're looking to be, you're always looking to be like a buyer of dirt cheap puts."
"4749730","4752230"," And you want to be a buyer of dirt cheap calls. "
"4753020","4758370"," If there's euphoria out there, any FOMO out there, I haven't checked Twitter yet, but I'm sure that"
"4758370","4761010"," I'm posting on the, on the handle, but."
"4761950","4764850"," I wonder what regular old Twitter is doing today."
"4767790","4769650"," Maybe I should have 50 K followers. "
"4769950","4770590"," That's Baba Yaga."
"4775370","4777630"," I love Baba Yaga."
"4784000","4788700"," And then Adam Manstein is telling you were in Santa rally week, no signs of stopping. "
"4789100","4790660"," Yeah, there's no signs of stopping."
"4791140","4791800"," There's none."
"4792320","4800360"," We already know right now there's buyers at 474.60. You know, you got heavy support here at 474 and"
"4800360","4803240"," the price target is definitely without a doubt. "
"4804380","4807540"," We're breaking through just so you guys know we're breaking through."
"4808420","4809780"," Resistance right now."
"4809980","4812200"," So those clear clear side. "
"4812440","4815840"," Clear skies are pointing towards 480."
"4817860","4827600"," I mean, it's showing that we've got sellers above here, but you've got clear"
"4827600","4830180"," skies to 478 480."
"4830940","4832580"," We know where the real ceiling is. "
"4832720","4833280"," It's, it's higher."
"4833560","4834420"," It's much higher this morning."
"4836580","4838620"," It doesn't matter if it takes into next week. "
"4840380","4842760"," Or excuse me, into the end of this week to get there."
"4843400","4852380"," You can see some, you can see this resistance above is starting to form at 476 70."
"4853420","4855700"," But in reality, it's, it's up here at 480. "
"4856560","4858300"," We know where the sound is going to come in."
"4859320","4861920"," You're going to turn shorts into longs here."
"4904490","4907530"," And actually, XBI is grabbing a bid right now. "
"4907530","4909690"," You guys are watching XBI."
"4909950","4911110"," It looks like it's building support."
"4912790","4915630"," It's like it had a nice bounce down at 1508. "
"4916250","4917790"," It's now up a dollar."
"4918630","4920030"," Might be worth watching."
"4931050","4932810"," You just see this grind on the spy. "
"4933630","4935130"," Profit taking time, right?"
"4935330","4936770"," Let the banks do the work for you."
"4937310","4941090"," Let the banks take you over 40, 40, 474 80."
"4941690","4943690"," You want to see us break through. "
"4944510","4948810"," If you guys want to know where to pick it back up again, you pick it back up at 475 "
"4948810","4965270",".04. This"
"4965270","4965890"," is a nice run."
"4969210","4970910"," Let me see if I can get some."
"4972610","4973510"," You're right there, buddy. "
"4979160","4980260"," So this is kind of crazy."
"4980280","4981520"," You guys want to be looking at this."
"4982000","4984480"," You guys check out the Twitter handle. "
"4986730","4989510"," Why you guys to see the flow that's coming through right now?"
"4990810","4993210"," So this is the question I have for you guys."
"4996010","5002510"," When you're you guys have been trading with me live now for a couple of weeks."
"5010230","5011770"," I want you to see this. "
"5011970","5012190"," Okay."
"5012670","5014490"," And the reason I want you to see this is because."
"5022130","5025090"," So I just posted some live flow coming through. "
"5026070","5029930"," And it has a lot of spy calls in the flow."
"5031410","5032990"," A lot of spy calls."
"5033490","5036770"," So you guys have been trading with me for a couple of weeks now live, right?"
"5036930","5039370"," Every day we come out, we trade, we buy the spy, we sell the spy. "
"5040010","5046210"," So when I start to see calls, when I see, when I see stuff like this, I'm looking at 1229,"
"5046630","5047990"," 478 C's, right?"
"5048270","5049810"," Racks of them being bought right now."
"5051210","5053530"," 475 C's, 480 C's."
"5054090","5056950"," So everyone's picking that trade up for end of year. "
"5057550","5061570"," Right now at this moment is after trading with me."
"5061690","5063170"," Is this something that you'd be doing?"
"5063770","5065850"," Hey, I'm going to add right now right at this moment."
"5068770","5073710"," I want to know if you guys could let me know in the comment box. "
"5073710","5075650"," Is this where you buy the spy?"
"5076510","5082030"," Or do you wait until we get over to buy the spy to 478, 480?"
"5083130","5084790"," Another reason I'm asking that is because."
"5086810","5089890"," You know, we're, we're usually trying to trade the turn."
"5090530","5095170"," And I always notice stuff like this happen once the trade is already done. "
"5095170","5101770"," And when the trade has already been made, then you start to see the interest kick in."
"5102190","5103270"," Do I think we're going to 480?"
"5103670","5103890"," I do."
"5104630","5109150"," Do I think that this moment right now is the best buy-in for the next trade to 480?"
"5109990","5110610"," Probably not. "
"5111310","5114230"," But I want to know what you guys think out there because it could be."
"5117170","5118430"," But I want to know what you guys think."
"5120700","5122000"," It's a great day, right Mary?"
"5122860","5123880"," Congratulations, Mary. "
"5124920","5125880"," You make some money this morning?"
"5130860","5132180"," Yeah, no FOMO, exactly."
"5132180","5133200"," So."
"5135040","5139160"," Exactly stocks pull back resistance support that attack. "
"5145440","5147080"," So that's my point is."
"5147520","5153040"," I mean, I don't, I love seeing the FOMO kick in, but I'm also looking for a deal here."
"5153320","5154660"," Last night we talked about. "
"5155260","5158080"," That it's okay to buy an expensive option."
"5158080","5162220"," If you're in a trend mode, if it is trend day, it's still okay to buy an option."
"5162220","5164800"," So I understand that part aspect of it. "
"5164800","5168840"," But really, I'm looking to be buying 47380."
"5170160","5170720"," 474."
"5171860","5179300"," I would buy the trend again if we broke above 47503 or so. "
"5179500","5182820"," I would pick that trend back up again here and I would buy this here."
"5183760","5186180"," But would I buy right when we're in the middle here?"
"5186840","5187660"," Probably not."
"5189060","5193080"," So it's always interesting to see when the buyers are coming out. "
"5193080","5195480"," Are we the guys selling them the bags right now?"
"5196200","5201040"," And I realize that this will print, but I am always looking for a deal, right?"
"5201240","5202460"," You guys are always looking for a deal."
"5205290","5206770"," Yes ma'am."
"5207530","5211310"," Dude, Mary Mary is just banking money. "
"5214930","5218950"," Your chart has supply from 470 to 471."
"5220750","5222230"," Let's take a look at 470."
"5222730","5224590"," I can tell you where the supply is. "
"5225190","5226770"," This is the supply right here."
"5227350","5228810"," This is where the supply is right here."
"5229450","5229930"," 47380. "
"5231210","5239650"," Then you've got more supply down at, so you can see it right here, right?"
"5240150","5249410"," Supplies at 473.75. And then your next supply zone is 472.93. You've got, there's no supply down"
"5249410","5249630"," here."
"5249730","5252950"," All the supply was here at the open and then it moved up."
"5253890","5254910"," It's very bullish. "
"5254910","5256930"," There's nothing, there's nothing."
"5259190","5262470"," There's nothing that's not bullish about where we are right at this moment."
"5263110","5267030"," You're probably going to see a giant green bar at some point. "
"5267950","5270050"," And we're getting close to that right now."
"5270550","5274990"," So you're probably going to see a squeeze in the next five minutes."
"5276030","5277050"," You guys ready for a squeeze?"
"5277910","5278810"," We're going to squeeze the spot. "
"5279910","5281310"," It's going to happen right now."
"5287520","5289380"," It comes to squeeze just so you know."
"5290980","5293600"," It's about to go to the moon as they say. "
"5298240","5305420"," Because once you break through this 47480 level, there is no, it's clear skies."
"5306180","5310840"," But all your friends know out there that we are right at a moment of a squeeze or rejection."
"5312860","5314340"," We're about to break through. "
"5314580","5318680"," If we break through this level here, I will pick the spy back up."
"5323000","5327220"," We'll get in a little bit more granular level here and see what's actually happening."
"5328980","5333980"," And the reason I'm telling you that we're looking like it's going to squeeze is because to see"
"5333980","5336680"," these sellers here, they're just getting destroyed. "
"5337700","5342660"," You can see a little bit of rejection above here, but we're just killing the sellers."
"5343240","5344300"," See it here as well."
"5346020","5347340"," Like lightning, right?"
"5347480","5353520"," We talk about the electric fence, but you see that we're just destroying all these sellers above"
"5353520","5353820"," here. "
"5357020","5359020"," So we'll look at this in a more granular level."
"5359320","5360420"," We know where to buy the dip."
"5360900","5362500"," It's at 472, right?"
"5362620","5364080"," You guys know where the dip buy is. "
"5364300","5365480"," You know where to pick it up."
"5368160","5372620"," So you've got supply down below at 47380."
"5374420","5380120"," We've got more supply down below at 47291. "
"5381160","5383780"," And you're also going to look at a more granular level."
"5383780","5384900"," We just talked about this, right?"
"5384900","5390180"," When you see stuff like this here, you don't see firm rejection."
"5391120","5395480"," It's showing you that the supply is there to wear out the sellers. "
"5396820","5400700"," If you're short this market at this level, it's very dangerous for you right now."
"5401280","5402500"," We're about to squeeze."
"5403300","5406920"," Let all your friends on Twitter know that we're going to squeeze in the next few minutes. "
"5409840","5411160"," Spy is going to rip."
"5411960","5412300"," You ready?"
"5415350","5416290"," It's blast off time."
"5416630","5417630"," You guys can see it live. "
"5424840","5430920"," You've got some more new supply coming in of sellers that were hiding above at 47.5.10 here."
"5431700","5433660"," You see these guys just came in."
"5436230","5438730"," These are some these were sellers that were hiding. "
"5444790","5445950"," They just showed up."
"5459770","5461070"," There's a saying no."
"5461810","5462170"," No. "
"5468410","5469390"," Yeah, this is monster."
"5476560","5476840"," Yeah."
"5477100","5477340"," Oh my. "
"5477720","5478620"," I'm printed."
"5478620","5479540"," I printed stupid."
"5480260","5483360"," I don't know what to say. "
"5491860","5493040"," I've printed stupid."
"5493040","5493860"," We're about to squeeze."
"5494500","5496080"," You see us breaking through over here. "
"5500180","5502600"," You're going to turn shorts into longs right here."
"5503120","5504080"," So short squeezes."
"5504460","5508020"," They're not as good as vanity trades. "
"5508300","5514820"," Gamma squeezes are always more prolonged and much higher than a short squeeze."
"5515300","5516900"," But the short squeeze is still good."
"5517560","5519380"," The short squeeze would get you to 478. "
"5521840","5526040"," So if we can get that short squeeze here, it'll be it'll be nice."
"5535890","5538890"," So 473 80 is where the smart money is."
"5540250","5542210"," We're going to start squeezing here in a little bit. "
"5542610","5544490"," You guys see this happening live right now."
"5544490","5546550"," You guys are all watching in tune into this happening."
"5548850","5551890"," They have major supply here at 474 90. "
"5552630","5554990"," So if you wanted to get in right, you wanted to ride."
"5555150","5556210"," If you wanted to take a gamble."
"5557630","5559490"," Buy yourself some zero dates. "
"5560350","5562430"," Let's look at some zero dates for the spy."
"5566350","5569090"," So the 478 C's."
"5570610","5573850"," Expiring today are worth two pennies. "
"5574510","5575790"," So it's risky."
"5576210","5578250"," I don't think it's going to work to be honest with you."
"5578690","5583390"," But if it did work, you've got two sent calls on spy. "
"5584250","5586370"," There's two pennies for 478."
"5587110","5589630"," You'd probably flip three or 500%."
"5590610","5592390"," If we break through right now. "
"5592390","5596590"," So either the market makers know we're not going to 478 today."
"5597210","5602110"," Or no one believes we're going to either people don't believe we're going to 478 today."
"5603770","5607210"," The money flow is showing that we are going to 478 today. "
"5607850","5613590"," So maybe maybe there's the sell side that we don't see in the market at this point."
"5614370","5618690"," Because there is zero interest in us going to 478 today."
"5619310","5621190"," And we're only I've only got there. "
"5621330","5622370"," They cost two pennies."
"5622650","5623050"," Right."
"5623170","5624270"," Fact, I'm going to buy some right now. "
"5624670","5625550"," Maybe I should."
"5627050","5635310"," I might buy some just in case by a hundred of them."
"5638000","5651600"," One hundred for $300. "
"5651660","5656220"," $300 bet for a hundred contracts of spy."
"5658400","5659800"," 478 expiring today."
"5661990","5663030"," That would be wild. "
"5667560","5668080"," All right."
"5668280","5669040"," Let's see if it happens."
"5671980","5673420"," If I go to 478 today. "
"5674260","5677100"," Let's see what the what I'd make on this."
"5683120","5684020"," It's 300 bucks."
"5684360","5685020"," What's 300 bucks?"
"5685340","5685560"," Nothing. "
"5686980","5687800"," It's a gamble."
"5689620","5692980"," I bet it's a better gamble than going to last Vegas right now."
"5703810","5704570"," Let's see. "
"5724040","5724420"," Okay."
"5724600","5724620"," Ready?"
"5728310","5732010"," If if we go to 478 today."
"5734420","5737940"," A $300 bet will make you 5600 bucks. "
"5738780","5740800"," If we went to 480 today."
"5741380","5743560"," You'd make 20 grand off 300 bucks."
"5747690","5749710"," Absolutely don't recommend that trade. "
"5757900","5759340"," Do not recommend that trade."
"5767510","5768830"," That's a crazy trade."
"5771520","5774200"," So if we did a straight shot to 478. "
"5775460","5777540"," You'd make 3000%."
"5778420","5779960"," If we went to 480."
"5780780","5782600"," You'd make 7000%. "
"5782600","5784380"," Just three more points."
"5784380","5787320"," So what does that say to you as a trader out there?"
"5790060","5796080"," Don't expect 478 today because the dealers, the brokers, the market makers are saying it ain't"
"5796080","5796400"," happening."
"5796920","5798560"," It's not in the cards for you today. "
"5799260","5800800"," So maybe don't expect to squeeze."
"5802500","5804720"," Because the market makers are telling you don't bother."
"5805080","5805940"," We're taking all your money. "
"5814380","5817460"," Market makers are saying thank you come again."
"5818080","5819040"," Thank you for playing."
"5819300","5820080"," Take your money and run. "
"5821100","5826220"," Rejoin the party at 473 80 or 40 or 4730."
"5843990","5846570"," Need like a soft bank to come in and just by."
"5847850","5848010"," Like. "
"5848610","5850570"," I don't know 5 million."
"5851470","5855630"," In zero dates for 478 or 480 would be even better."
"5855970","5857190"," But like a penny each. "
"5862540","5866140"," No, do not buy do not buy zero dates for 478."
"5866700","5867420"," Do not."
"5867620","5870220"," What the markets telling you is that we're not going there today. "
"5870540","5871560"," That's what the markets telling you."
"5872060","5875760"," Market saying to you do not expect 478 today."
"5876800","5881800"," So that means you're a buyer down below at 473 472. "
"5882100","5884080"," You get some ice coming in down below here."
"5884420","5886800"," You get some ice at 472 93."
"5887840","5888880"," We'll go even lower. "
"5889300","5889700"," Take a look."
"5891790","5893330"," I mean, it's been known to happen."
"5893330","5895110"," That's the thing about the Christmas rallies. "
"5895350","5897650"," It's usually just one straight long grind up."
"5897890","5900030"," People make some stupid serious money."
"5900870","5903730"," But I'm a buyer here at 473 474. "
"5904110","5908170"," I want to give a little bit of room for us to go up here."
"5910260","5911560"," If there's any relief."
"5912680","5917020"," We wouldn't be shocking to see us trade sideways to end of day at this point. "
"5917760","5921840"," But if we did get some relief down at 473 80."
"5923320","5926920"," Or if we even dipped down to 470 like someone else pointed out earlier."
"5927260","5929560"," If we got a gift of going down to 470. "
"5930260","5931780"," I'd be a buyer down there as well."
"5932720","5936560"," I'd buy some 2 cent or 6 cent calls at that point."
"5937020","5938280"," If we rip into clothes. "
"5938840","5942040"," So what can happen right now is they're going to grind out all the all the calls."
"5942560","5944640"," And pledge today because today is an apex."
"5945180","5948440"," So they'll eat all that money and then possibly end of day. "
"5948760","5950160"," You'll see a rip into clothes."
"5950160","5955800"," So what I'm probably going to do is take the rest of the data."
"5955860","5958760"," Just relax and wait for a move later in the afternoon. "
"5963310","5965090"," Yeah, I'll take a look at VA right now."
"5966050","5968290"," So you got to think about that you have to think about the."
"5968750","5973470"," The dealers to think about the options that are expiring today. "
"5973870","5975590"," And it doesn't always happen."
"5975650","5978290"," You guys know you guys know that some days on Opex."
"5978810","5980450"," We will still crush it. "
"5980630","5982150"," You know that some days on Opex."
"5982150","5984010"," We will sell down and print."
"5985070","5988530"," Like you guys know you guys if you guys have taken bear trades. "
"5989110","5994290"," There on Opex is we'll have 2, 3 cent puts that print 60, 70 cents."
"5994830","5997170"," So I guess it's not that you can't take that trade today."
"5997690","5998670"," You could take those two. "
"5999010","5999670"," What does it cost?"
"5999910","6001330"," You get a hundred contracts 300 bucks."
"6001950","6004530"," If you've already made 20, 30, 40,000 dollars."
"6005750","6011490"," You buy a rack of them for 300 bucks and they'll print you anywhere from 5 to 20,000 dollars. "
"6011490","6012690"," Is it risky?"
"6013070","6013230"," Sure."
"6013910","6014870"," Is it probable?"
"6016830","6019750"," There's a 99% chance that they're not going to print."
"6021670","6023630"," But that's a nice bounce on VA. "
"6027220","6029720"," But this is where you have a war story to tell somebody."
"6032420","6037920"," It's where you have a war story to tell somebody that you made bank on some stupid play."
"6038840","6042020"," Okay, so you've got hard support at 190 on VA. "
"6042800","6048300"," You've got real nice support for today on VA between 198, 199, 200."
"6048820","6050600"," You have some consolidation at 202."
"6051460","6054660"," Your major resistance right now is that 205 and 215. "
"6056440","6060080"," The thing about VA is it's always being shorted."
"6060780","6064360"," It's the kind of star I used to play VA a lot."
"6065500","6068760"," I like playing VA, but it's very news driven. "
"6069700","6073320"," For it to squeeze and that's often why you see big moves in VA."
"6073720","6078480"," This is a prime, prime example of a stock that is always being shorted."
"6078840","6084880"," You've got a walls above at 205, 215, 220, and you have more. "
"6085120","6087160"," Let's see if we got more buyers than sellers right now."
"6087580","6092840"," So someone knows something's up with VA because you've only got 64,000 sellers."
"6093500","6094180"," You've got 100. "
"6094500","6096920"," You've got a near double buyers on VA right now."
"6099110","6100610"," Let's take a look at the chart on VA."
"6101270","6103870"," There was a lot of call flow this morning on VA. "
"6104570","6106110"," I will post that for you."
"6109620","6111220"," Yeah, you've got great support down here."
"6111320","6112340"," This is a nice buy, by the way. "
"6112740","6115340"," If any of you are in VA right now, it's a real nice buy."
"6116820","6117560"," I like VA."
"6117980","6118640"," I like trading VA. "
"6119520","6120120"," You've got more."
"6120620","6121740"," I'm going to post this."
"6122040","6128500"," So Affirm, someone called out AFRM earlier and they've got huge call flow coming through. "
"6128500","6132760"," I will post that call flow for Affirm right now."
"6133400","6135340"," And we'll look at the Affirm chart for you guys."
"6135700","6137480"," You guys are looking for entries or exits. "
"6139870","6141170"," Someone up AFRM."
"6141470","6143490"," I'm going to post the Affirm stuff right now for you."
"6145610","6155390"," And here's some Affirm"
"6155390","6155810"," flow. "
"6156130","6157930"," And then I'll post the VA flow next."
"6163830","6165910"," Because I know I saw calls coming in for VA this morning."
"6167590","6170470"," Where did I see VA calls coming in this morning?"
"6170470","6176150"," I knew I saw some VA calls. "
"6181660","6184540"," I'm going to post the VA calls that they rolled in this morning."
"6184880","6186200"," The buy the dippers jumped in."
"6187120","6187900"," I like this play. "
"6190210","6191510"," I like to dip buy in VA."
"6192770","6194810"," Keep your eyes up on news for VA."
"6208540","6210180"," And let's look up Affirm next. "
"6216590","6217030"," Affirm."
"6219880","6220340"," Subscribe."
"6221020","6223280"," Let's see where the support and resistance is on Affirm. "
"6230390","6231110"," Ooh, this is juicy."
"6233130","6234390"," This is really juicy."
"6234390","6244120"," So you're buying the dippers on"
"6244120","6245540"," Affirm or at 104. "
"6246880","6249300"," You've also have strong support."
"6249840","6252260"," You've got flow coming in at 10676."
"6252260","6257200"," And they're looking for 108, 110, 112, 111. "
"6260700","6262000"," I've traded Affirm."
"6262560","6266140"," This stock has a tendency to want to rip to like 130, 140."
"6266880","6269920"," I remember we were buying this dipper a month or two ago. "
"6269920","6273660"," And we were getting trades to 130, 145 up here."
"6274360","6275480"," And these are these are big printers."
"6275900","6280820"," You've got more support down below here at $90, $95, 104. "
"6282260","6284580"," You've got some real nice support here on Affirm."
"6285540","6286980"," You've got ice above at 125."
"6288740","6289680"," This is a nice trade. "
"6290480","6291240"," I like this trade."
"6296090","6297010"," And yeah, there you go."
"6297590","6299110"," This is what you're shooting for if you trade. "
"6299430","6303630"," So if you're trading Affirm, if you're bullish on Affirm, I'd be taking a 145 C."
"6304910","6305830"," That's where I'd be at."
"6306110","6309310"," I'd be looking for this print up, print way above here at 145."
"6309970","6313490"," If you eat through these sellers here, you've got clear skies to 145. "
"6316070","6318950"," You've got buyers consuming sellers."
"6320870","6325130"," This is all the, all these trades that you guys are calling out to me."
"6325430","6331030"," These are all looking like gamma. "
"6331330","6334910"," Gamma is going to come off on these stocks as we head into Friday."
"6339570","6341010"," These are all gamma trades."
"6345610","6346910"," 478 on the spy. "
"6349590","6356810"," If 478 prints on the spy, just the heads up."
"6356970","6361730"," If 478 prints on the spy, it's going to print stupid."
"6362890","6364150"," It's going to print something. "
"6364570","6365110"," It's going to print."
"6366030","6370550"," If you get 478 on the spy, it's going to print stupid."
"6371340","6373990"," Oh, no. "
"6374610","6379570"," So the 478, zero dates are up 100%."
"6379570","6381670"," I don't think."
"6388050","6388990"," Too funny. "
"6389730","6390650"," Too funny."
"6394680","6397820"," If we print 478 today on the spy, I don't know."
"6398080","6398900"," I don't know if they say to you. "
"6399620","6404220"," Talk about some talk about some derivatives or talk about some arbitrage."
"6407730","6409650"," And they're back down to their original price."
"6409650","6412170"," Looks like somebody took profit on those 478s. "
"6412550","6417790"," They were at two cents and they went to four cents on that."
"6417910","6419010"," On that push right here."
"6419310","6420190"," A push right here. "
"6420270","6421830"," Someone just sold out of their position."
"6423750","6432050"," Right in down below at 474.96. It'd be hilarious if we printed there today."
"6432730","6433450"," It would make my day. "
"6438530","6441970"," If those printed 478s, that would be stupid."
"6448500","6449140"," Yeah, they would print."
"6449640","6453600"," So if they went into the money at 478, they would go to 99 cents. "
"6455360","6456600"," I don't think it happens though."
"6457240","6460880"," I think that the market makers are telling you no."
"6464940","6467960"," Don't forget to put your cheap penny hedges on. "
"6469160","6470580"," Told you guys that how many times."
"6470880","6472460"," Make sure you guys are buying some penny hedges."
"6475550","6477410"," Now this is right at that moment. "
"6477670","6479310"," Just like when you know I can run bottoms."
"6479530","6483930"," We talk about going along when everybody is short the market."
"6484610","6485610"," This is the place. "
"6486190","6489990"," 475 is a reasonable place to buy some cheap put protection."
"6491270","6492370"," If you're along this market."
"6493630","6495230"," This is a good time for you. "
"6495350","6498870"," If you're invested in stocks and you want to hedge yourself."
"6498870","6500030"," We're at 475."
"6500590","6506070"," So you figure that all the banks are saying that will be at 5 between 480. "
"6506370","6507810"," Let's say and I think the worst."
"6508470","6510290"," I think XBI that."
"6511910","6513270"," What what bank was it. "
"6514530","6515650"," Up to luck with back."
"6515830","6520350"," Any one of the banks said that we would wouldn't get as high as 480 for 2022."
"6520930","6523990"," And some of the most bullish banks like JPM, I think said for. "
"6525310","6525850"," 524."
"6526730","6527190"," 2020."
"6527810","6530130"," So if you're at 475 you figure right now. "
"6530850","6534970"," You could buy some nice put spread hedges that are 1 to 3 months out."
"6536010","6538310"," You buy them at 475 in the money."
"6538690","6542250"," If you buy them at 480 expiring in March, March 31. "
"6543170","6544370"," It's called a 480."
"6545350","6550270"," And if you wanted to get crazy bullish heading into the, the, the ER season."
"6550970","6555210"," It'd be a nice little way to protect your, protect yourself as you move forward. "
"6556370","6560930"," Because the question becomes, what is the lowest we're going to go."
"6561170","6563890"," So mark my words right now right now at 475, right?"
"6564370","6569610"," Do you think we'll come back to C 475 on the spy by March 31?"
"6570270","6571170"," I would say yes."
"6572050","6573430"," I would say as a fair chance of that. "
"6577320","6579360"," I'd say by March 31 or so."
"6579560","6580480"," Matter of fact, let me take a look at it."
"6580560","6581620"," Let me get a better date for you. "
"6581620","6592220"," Yeah, you'd"
"6592220","6596140"," probably get a, I wouldn't, you know what I said 31st I would take."
"6596400","6597380"," What, what trade would I take?"
"6598660","6599340"," Right here."
"6599480","6600520"," What trade would I would take?"
"6601520","6603400"," I would take the spy. "
"6605680","6608840"," March 18, 475 or for it."
"6608880","6609840"," Call it like 480."
"6612120","6616720"," 475 P put debit spread or even a put credit spread. "
"6617740","6621060"," The credit spreads kind of suck unless you're already going in the direct."
"6621060","6621820"," They're kind of directional."
"6622520","6625820"," You really want to, you really want to be going in that direction when you buy credit spreads. "
"6626400","6631080"," But if you buy a debit spread, they can just kind of get there eventually and start printing."
"6631500","6635380"," You have to sometimes hold them to expiration for them to print."
"6635980","6641140"," But if you do hold them to expiration and you're printing, they print heavy into, into their"
"6641140","6641460"," expiration. "
"6644070","6647110"," I've held many call spreads, especially debit spreads."
"6647670","6650970"," I've seen them go up thousands and then go down thousands."
"6651230","6654270"," And then the last week they print just stupid. "
"6654850","6655590"," Like stupid."
"6656130","6662990"," But their, their protection play, their safety play, they're more forgivable than just naked"
"6662990","6663510"," trading."
"6666100","6668440"," And what are we looking for as a bull, right?"
"6668540","6672340"," I talked to you guys about buying the dip at 473 down below here, right?"
"6672340","6676700"," We talked about this dip by, we talked about the dip by 47450. "
"6677820","6679840"," And so we're looking for a reaction here, right?"
"6680260","6682320"," You're like, okay, so where do we buy the dip captain?"
"6682860","6686140"," And you're looking for the exhaustion of sellers."
"6687300","6692040"," And if we don't see the exhaustion of sellers, we're then going to check the next level to make"
"6692040","6692300"," entry."
"6697610","6702990"," And you see that the smart money is down here at 473.80. So this is where I want to"
"6702990","6703850"," buy in. "
"6703850","6704690"," I want to buy this right here."
"6705130","6708850"," So I want to keep my eyes right now on the spot for another buy in."
"6713670","6719610"," Snap yourself a line at 473.80, which is what I'm doing right here. "
"6725390","6727730"," And we'll wait and see if the buyers step in."
"6729920","6732400"," This would make for a nice call spread heading into Friday."
"6732980","6736240"," You get like a, you get a Friday expiry, 473. "
"6737640","6740220"," And the money, eventually, eventually make a hundred percent."
"6741340","6742700"," You can set it and forget it."
"6747690","6749030"," We're also looking here. "
"6749370","6752950"," So when we're looking for this buy in right here, I want to see like this."
"6752950","6755550"," I want to see these buyers consume the sellers."
"6756090","6758830"," You still have more sellers right now on this buy. "
"6761090","6763010"," So I'm going to take a break there and wait."
"6765780","6767000"," How is Tesla looking?"
"6767220","6768040"," We'll look at Tesla next."
"6770970","6773470"," I'm going to log off here and just a bit. "
"6773710","6775670"," So this will be the last ticker that I look at."
"6776130","6778530"," I need to take my dog up for a walk."
"6784020","6784840"," Take a lunch break. "
"6786020","6786960"," Relax a little bit."
"6786960","6787920"," Look at profit."
"6788580","6788980"," Smile. "
"6800240","6801380"," Let's look at Tesla."
"6823960","6826980"," Where are we looking for some consolidation on Tesla?"
"6829810","6830290"," 1070."
"6831110","6834650"," If you wanted to rebuy Tesla, it's risky here at 1102. "
"6834710","6835430"," I'm not going to lie to you."
"6836290","6841400"," It's risky to be entering Tesla right here."
"6842760","6847980"," If you want to be a safe trader, the buy looks like it's at 1070. "
"6852820","6853980"," If you're day trading Tesla."
"6853980","6863850"," I know that seems crazy loading you guys out there."
"6864390","6866790"," And then you guys are like, no, it's not going any lower. "
"6871570","6877730"," We'll scroll in here for a closer look."
"6878350","6881670"," So you can see if this will consolidate and keep ripping higher."
"6894230","6895790"," We'll take it on a more granular level. "
"6895950","6897270"," I know some of you guys want to know what's up."
"6899660","6901480"," Now you guys look, you guys see over here."
"6901780","6904460"," You see how there's a mountain of buyers down lower. "
"6906700","6907580"," 1095, 1090."
"6907580","6910120"," This is where the supply is right now on Tesla."
"6911240","6912960"," So you'll probably see some weakness. "
"6913320","6913800"," You've got buyer."
"6913960","6915020"," These are sellers right here."
"6915480","6919540"," But you've got the, you've got supply down here at 1095, 1090. "
"6925870","6927330"," This is where the supply is."
"6931420","6938700"," You could take a 10 minute trade down here at not 1090 or 1095 running up again to 1100."
"6943450","6946410"," I'll snap some more lines here for myself to play this. "
"6952030","6953970"," You want to see a reaction at 1095."
"6956580","6959040"," You're by the dip is that 1090."
"6963630","6968250"," So your, so your, so your consolidation looking for a bounce. "
"6968890","6971670"," Number is 1095 to 1090."
"6972070","6975890"," And then you're by the F and dip is that 1070."
"6981610","6989660"," Nice simple, simple way to trade Tesla today. "
"6996370","6998790"," Y'all put Amazon up for you guys before I head out of here."
"7002670","7003110"," Yeah."
"7003290","7003330"," Yeah. "
"7003990","7004590"," Blood stuns."
"7004790","7007470"," I don't, I don't think I, I'm not anti."
"7007750","7010350"," The one thing that so I'm, I'm bullish on next year. "
"7011450","7013070"," You guys heard me last night."
"7013130","7013850"," We talked about it."
"7014390","7015590"," Let's say we only go out. "
"7015650","7016930"," Let's say every bank."
"7017450","7020990"," Let's say they all called for us to see five 20."
"7021750","7022510"," Next year. "
"7022690","7024130"," They, they're usually wrong in their forecast."
"7024430","7025610"," Let's just say they'll call 520."
"7026470","7026970"," And let's say. "
"7028430","7031330"," We see 580 next year, 590."
"7031650","7032870"," Or even if we see 520."
"7033570","7034910"," If they're forecasting 520. "
"7035710","7039930"," That means they're more than likely looking to dump the market at some point this spring or summer."
"7040950","7045810"," And then so ask yourself, where do you think that they'll dump, they'll dump this."
"7046410","7049210"," To get max gains on the downside and the upside. "
"7049950","7056950"," So it's probably somewhere in that it's probably somewhere back down."
"7056950","7057590"," At some point."
"7058750","7062830"," Maybe lower, maybe we see lower into summertime. "
"7064110","7068890"," Or end of year, if the inflation, if inflation becomes way more permanent."
"7069470","7070550"," And if we start to see."
"7071130","7074750"," We're, we know to expect two rates in 2022. "
"7075030","7076250"," So maybe we get a third."
"7076430","7077250"," We don't know about it."
"7077610","7080330"," And that's how we would see a rough end of the year. "
"7083660","7086560"," But something in the money, if you guys are hedging, you just do something in the money."
"7086680","7087680"," You don't have to go that deep with it."
"7088300","7091600"," Or if you wanted to do a true market hedge and you wanted to go. "
"7092180","7094220"," Buy like a 390 or something."
"7095280","7096480"," Yeah, you can buy that."
"7096600","7101100"," But you have to differentiate between what a year long hedges and what a."
"7102660","7104080"," Three month hedges, right?"
"7104360","7105220"," Why are we buying the hedge?"
"7105520","7107380"," How long we're going to put the hedge on for. "
"7109260","7111480"," Is this just in case the market crashes."
"7113520","7114920"," Alright, so I'll be back."
"7114920","7115860"," I got to take my dog out. "
"7115960","7118240"," My dogs can tell he needs to go to the bathroom."
"7118940","7121900"," So I will be signing off with you today for the moment."
"7121900","7127160"," If we come to another pivot moment in the market today, I will let you guys know. "
"7128040","7130300"," I'm still looking for this 47380."
"7130300","7132480"," I don't know if I'll get it, but that's what I'm really looking for."
"7132660","7136700"," You can see some sellers are now forming up around 477. "
"7138300","7140420"," 478 and 480 actually right here at 480."
"7140640","7141600"," So we're making a move to 480."
"7142340","7143560"," This is a beautiful right here. "
"7143560","7144000"," Look at this."
"7144660","7146040"," 473, right?"
"7146880","7153120"," 472, 74, 473.87. I'm a buyer all day long in my target."
"7153640","7155660"," I price target on the spy right now is 480. "
"7156960","7159540"," Alright, I'll check back in with you guys later this afternoon."

"7171920","7176880"," I have a pinned post on my Twitter handle so that you don't have to use PayPal. "
"7177520","7182840"," If you are a broke trader, a new trader, I don't expect anything from you out there."
"7183220","7184880"," This is a free handle free sub."
"7185020","7187380"," I'll never force anyone to pay for this. "
"7187700","7192980"," It does help those support the channel to pay for me to get this information out to you."
"7193080","7195900"," It does cost me a lot of money to pay for these services."
