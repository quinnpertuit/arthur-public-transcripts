"5450","7150"," Check one, two, check, Mike, check."
"12380","13340"," Yee-haw, doggy."
"15219","16180"," Four minutes left. "
"42530","42990"," BAM!"
"53390","54550"," Good morning out there."
"56970","57930"," How's everybody doing?"
"69500","71680"," Got a few things we got to do here before we open up."
"73000","75160"," I got some calls I'm looking at here. "
"75380","76960"," We are going to get right into it."
"77160","77800"," Boom, right there."
"78500","80140"," I haven't done any of the levels yet. "
"80620","81960"," So I'll put those up for you here."
"82160","83120"," Fairfax, some mornings is good."
"83720","84940"," Do the levels with you. "
"85880","88220"," We are coming into some supply right on the bell right now."
"88260","89240"," We've got three minutes left."
"91780","92740"," Just wanted to get up. "
"93020","97380"," I had problems this morning with some having some issues and technical issues in the background."
"97900","100880"," Still having them right now, but I was like, fuck that, we have to get up."
"102300","104000"," So, let me know in the chat. "
"104000","105300"," First off, good morning."
"106500","110060"," Let me know in the chat if you're going to Diamondhand."
"111880","114180"," Usually, overnight I sell. "
"114600","119960"," Well, I got a few rules on this, but normally I will take the money off the bell."
"120820","122300"," Two minutes left until open."
"124600","128580"," And I renegotiate the trade for higher. "
"129979","134500"," So if I'm losing money, if I've lost all the money in the trade, like if I've lost every dollar."
"136660","137680"," I'll leave them on."
"138080","140200"," So if they're just like dead calls or dead puts. "
"140940","142260"," And I'm not going to make anything."
"142440","143960"," Like I've got no point in selling them."
"144560","146400"," It's just a lot of trade at that point. "
"146600","149140"," If I'm down just a little bit, I'll normally close."
"149620","152240"," If I'm up, I will normally close."
"152800","156120"," When I run the probability on this stuff, I tend to do better. "
"157280","158040"," Taking the money and running."
"160660","162060"," Personally, that's just me."
"162060","163680"," And then I renegotiate the trade. "
"164220","166600"," Or my my trading for the rest of the day."
"167300","171000"," Sometimes I could have made more money, but for me at least."
"172100","174780"," Looking back on my my my trainer log. "
"175160","176300"," I tend to do better."
"177700","179040"," Each trade is a."
"180380","181900"," A renegotiation now."
"182900","185280"," When you're trading zero dates and one dates as well. "
"186100","188860"," Once that trade is over, you lose that value."
"188860","189440"," There's no."
"191900","193940"," There's no there's no implied value. "
"194480","197600"," It's called intrinsic value on a zero date."
"197820","201200"," So the moment that that direction is over, you're losing money anyways."
"202200","203360"," So there's that idea. "
"203600","207320"," Now, you know, there's always going to be somebody in the comments that comes back in."
"208920","210280"," We got 25 seconds left."
"210820","214280"," Someone always come back and be like, well, you could have made 4000%. "
"214860","217980"," So it is always someone in the comments whether you're winning or losing."
"217980","222080"," That had a better trade or held or sold."
"223140","227200"," Now, the only rule that I would give here would be sometimes it takes a few minutes. "
"227660","229460"," 30 seconds paying the time."
"229540","234300"," Sounds like 15 seconds and has two minutes for those options to build premium."
"235240","236760"," As you look at one second left here. "
"239120","240080"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"240220","242140"," Two dollars and 41 cents right now."
"242300","244620"," Two forty two doggy. "
"249090","249810"," And I'm out."
"249810","250910"," I'm flat right now."
"253330","255209"," So I think that this is what I do. "
"255450","256769"," I take the money and run."
"257610","259290"," We can go up from here."
"259550","261390"," I got no issues with us going up from here. "
"261570","263590"," I like to take the money and then you know what?"
"263970","267330"," This is another thing that I like to talk to people about is, you know, you take the money and"
"267330","271490"," run and let's say you're in for something for a hundred contracts."
"272650","279030"," You can go back in with 10 contracts and rebuild the position 10, 20, 30, 40 at a better price."
"279030","280450"," I mean, let's look at it right now. "
"280550","283330"," So four sevens an hour from millmolar up to two forty seven."
"283650","290790"," But I can go back in right now with four oh nines for a dollar sixteen and renegotiate my bet."
"290790","292490"," Be like, OK, so I'm in for a dollar now. "
"292550","293630"," I'm keeping a dollar."
"294550","296530"," Now I've got a free trade for the day, right?"
"297690","300090"," So that's just just that's just for me."
"301790","302810"," How I do things. "
"303050","305550"," I don't know how you maybe you can tell me in the chat how you do things."
"306910","312970"," I like to I personally like to renegotiate every trade."
"318380","319700"," So you can do what you want. "
"319880","323420"," I realize I realize that some of you are like, no, no, no, no."
"323660","324840"," We're just going to ride them all the way up."
"326620","327300"," That's fine. "
"327720","328280"," I'm good with that."
"331480","332600"," We just second here."
"332680","333700"," I got to do the levels for you. "
"338710","340450"," I was having a screener problems."
"340870","342510"," So I signed up for."
"343750","345130"," Happy Friday, everybody. "
"345750","348750"," So the point is four oh five."
"350930","352170"," Way down here."
"352230","353410"," We got some stuff to look at here. "

"359670","360790"," Way down here."
"365590","367030"," We get a bunch of H lines. "
"367050","368130"," We just got rid of this one."
"368290","369590"," So we just take that one out."
"369750","371210"," We got rid of that one over there. "
"373010","374630"," Nice combination this morning."
"375090","376790"," Look at that five minute trigger down there."
"377350","379350"," Unbeautiful, sexy five minute trigger. "
"380030","382890"," Alerted you on alert you on."
"383730","384450"," Hold on here."

"385570","386650"," We blew past that one."
"386730","387690"," So I'm going to get rid of that one."
"388030","389170"," That H line is out. "
"389470","390670"," Next one is up here."
"391210","392970"," Up at four eleven ninety."
"392970","396110"," I gave a target on ES this morning as well. "
"396110","398050"," So you can take a look at that for the hourly trigger."

"611760","615600"," VIX now trading underneath the daily trigger."
"615600","618220"," The hourly is coming down on top of it. "
"619160","620500"," I want to show you that next."
"630410","632610"," A trap for the bears this morning."

"654040","657840"," Two price on the VIX staying underneath the hourly. "
"658720","666320"," You now have one, two, three, four trigger cluster on the VIX to start selling off on a Friday down"
"666320","666520"," here."
"666920","668760"," And looking for some new lows."

"690620","691260"," We're going to look at it."
"691360","692280"," So just right here."
"693840","695380"," We're going to see it close up. "
"696060","698320"," Even if the VIX gets a quick pump in it."
"698860","699480"," Like this."
"699740","701300"," You're just waiting for it to rip lower. "
"701500","702980"," You're waiting for this five minute to come down."
"703120","705800"," The hourly to come down and start sending this lower."
"709640","711100"," There's that hourly right there. "
"711220","711660"," Five minutes."
"711860","712200"," One minute."
"712500","713120"," Daily trigger. "
"713840","718440"," So you're looking for a rejection here to go lower on the VIX."
"730540","732980"," I'll keep my eyes on the VIX in the background for you."
"737660","739460"," Nice squeeze for a Friday. "
"739680","741560"," Nice relief rally for a Friday."
"753910","757290"," See if you can get a better H line for you here."
"757510","757670"," Hold on. "
"757910","759890"," I'm going to try to get a better H line above for you."
"764360","765220"," See if I can get a."
"766420","767680"," Let me just second here in the back."
"767780","769920"," I got to go back and look back in time here and see. "
"772460","774880"," Where exactly that T off was."
"776260","778020"," There's like a failure right here."
"779380","780400"," And there's one. "
"780720","782020"," I think that might be it right there."
"782020","782860"," I think I'm right on that one."
"785080","786480"," It's like sometimes it's hard to see. "
"788500","788940"," Okay."
"794290","795970"," Just check these one more time."
"797850","800250"," Where all these squat scally wag bears are. "
"801210","802930"," So I'm going to see if they can get an exact tick."
"803070","806030"," Sometimes, you know, you don't get the exact tick in the."
"806330","808210"," See R1, R2, R3. "
"808470","809530"," We're above the pivot."
"810210","813730"," Above R1, above R2, above R3, or heading to R3 right now."
"813730","817790"," Where we have a four trigger cluster that's extreme bullishness to the upside. "
"827960","830740"," I'm going to do your supports on the downside now if you're a bear."
"834010","835410"," And are we done going down?"
"835410","836210"," That would be the big question."
"836530","837090"," Was that bottom?"
"837690","838050"," Did we not?"
"838230","839350"," Did Cap not get his. "
"839890","840330"," 396."
"840490","841330"," He did not get his 400."
"842170","843550"," Was 403 bottom. "
"844210","844930"," It's tough to say."
"845370","847790"," Like we like start a new rotation."
"849250","850510"," I don't think so. "
"851790","855970"," I still want to, if we can, I would still next week like to see."
"857070","858530"," I still would like to see."
"859650","862730"," See if I can take a look at the NBI real quick. "
"864470","866210"," You know, the NBI is."
"867390","869370"," The NBI is, I'll say this."
"869690","871130"," The NBI is right where it was. "
"871570","872490"," The last bottom."
"873170","876490"," So the last bottom that we had just a week ago or whatever."
"876870","877590"," This was it. "
"878230","880450"," So NBI came through this morning."
"881190","884010"," And this was the bottom of the last rotation that we had."
"885370","887530"," So could we run for two, three days?"
"887870","889650"," The bulls have that on their side. "
"891730","893590"," The bulls can make that argument."
"894150","895390"," We just did it last week."
"896250","897750"," We just did it last week. "
"898010","899630"," So could that be bottom for."
"900410","901110"," I don't know."
"901190","902810"," A few sessions, two, three sessions possible. "
"903490","904270"," I hope that it's not."
"904270","904830"," I want to."
"904930","905510"," I need us to come. "
"905670","910110"," Not need us, but I always like to see us get down to like 20%."
"910110","912530"," We were down to 31% yesterday."
"914090","915290"," I would like to see it. "
"915470","917450"," I mean, I always like buying in confidence."
"918090","921350"," I never like buying like a, like a, like a, like a."
"921570","922290"," Hold on a second here."
"923170","924670"," 40 S1 is 403. "
"930140","930540"," 49."
"933520","934160"," S2."
"936940","938060"," S3 down here. "
"941560","942840"," S24 185."
"944400","947380"," There was an argument being made yesterday that."
"947900","953600"," Oh, yesterday day before I didn't bring it up yesterday that we could, we could that all of this"
"953600","957300"," shit with the banks could trigger a nasty short squeeze. "
"958140","959340"," Like, like nasty."
"963800","966940"," From nasty, like two, three hundred point nasty."
"969940","974080"," And we've seen stuff like that in the SNL crisis too. "
"974260","976080"," We've seen we saw that happen in the SNL crisis."
"977380","980480"," Trading 410 right now."
"983660","987360"," No stops left behind for the bulls. "
"1010170","1010610"," Okay."
"1010770","1011310"," What are you doing here?"
"1011910","1012490"," I'm almost there."
"1012590","1014770"," Trading 410 19 right now. "
"1019770","1022750"," 4130 on ES has some pretty decent supply on it."
"1034790","1035230"," Okay."
"1035450","1036150"," I think we're ready here. "
"1036390","1037930"," We get a, I got a few more things I got to do."
"1038550","1040670"," I got to put financial juice on."
"1042349","1044670"," I had to like reset my system. "
"1045490","1061820"," I've got a, I've got"
"1061820","1066000"," a, I've got a like I'm switching over from, oh, by the way, I'm going to make this, I want"
"1066000","1066920"," to make this public here."
"1069020","1071560"," Fuck you, Xfinity and fuck you Comcast."
"1072200","1076660"," If I never have to pay you ever again for the rest of my life, go fuck yourself. "
"1079960","1083840"," The fact that I'm finally getting fiber."
"1085040","1091380"," If I never have to pay you again for the rest of my life, it's one small win that I've"
"1091380","1092380"," had my entire life."
"1092700","1096620"," One small thorn that I've lived with for decades. "
"1098360","1100500"," I hate you Comcast and I hate you Xfinity."
"1101100","1101980"," They're done."
"1103620","1105900"," Take this job and shove it. "
"1109140","1110840"," US unemployment rate this morning."
"1112360","1117600"," Bazaar I'm on fintuit and the numbers come out and we got people out there going."
"1118560","1121020"," We're getting a rate hike in June and I'm like, yeah, no. "
"1122000","1124120"," Well, there's a few things that were sent into this morning."
"1124760","1128340"," They're like, we're getting more rate hikes, doom and gloom."
"1128640","1129740"," And I'm like, whoa, whoa, whoa. "
"1129740","1130900"," Time out here."
"1135520","1136640"," I'm like, time out."
"1137200","1139940"," I'm like, number one. "
"1141320","1143940"," Yes, we know we're getting more rate hikes."
"1144700","1145300"," We know that."
"1146400","1148520"," We're likely not getting them this summer. "
"1150580","1153340"," We're likely going to get them in September."
"1154620","1156140"," You mark my words on that."
"1156740","1158600"," Now, let's say I'm wrong. "
"1158600","1159940"," Kevin Jim's wrong."
"1160080","1161840"," We get rate hikes in June and July and August."
"1162180","1163560"," Let's see who did it once in a month. "
"1163560","1165140"," He gets you two at three emergency rate hikes."
"1166140","1166900"," I don't know."
"1167460","1168800"," But it doesn't really matter. "
"1170300","1172940"," And the reason why I think it doesn't matter."
"1174680","1180860"," One of the reasons why I think they are pausing for the summer is because they ran into this"
"1180860","1182540"," regional banking bullshit crisis."
"1183880","1184760"," Corporate rating. "
"1186640","1187740"," As Bob Kendall."
"1188140","1192880"," Dude, eloquently sat titled his video last night eloquently."
"1194820","1195860"," The vigilantes. "
"1196060","1198320"," We know if you don't know who the vigilantes are."
"1198720","1200780"," Look up the bond vigilantes."
"1201400","1203500"," There's some books you can read about these guys. "
"1204600","1207220"," And this is like we were talking about this earlier this week."
"1208480","1212000"," It's like new school corporate rating on stream."
"1212000","1214560"," The other day I said remind me of the movie Wall Street. "
"1216120","1217840"," Reminding me of the 1980s."
"1219040","1219940"," Greed is good."
"1221060","1225960"," And if you can destroy a bank and consolidate them. "
"1226160","1230120"," If it's known that we're in the part of a business cycle, it'll be traditional."
"1230540","1230900"," Traditional."
"1233100","1234780"," Weakness in the banking sector. "
"1235600","1237140"," And you can go in there and just start rating."
"1238480","1241820"," Like a coyote or a fox in the head house."
"1243060","1244280"," Then you fucking do it. "
"1245300","1246960"," That's why people are rich."
"1248000","1249480"," Now that doesn't mean I like it."
"1250280","1251960"," But it is crazy to watch. "
"1253000","1255060"," In a business cycle."
"1258560","1259160"," Traditionally."
"1260460","1262460"," Having a weak financial sector. "
"1264540","1266820"," For some of the associations."
"1267900","1270440"," With that traditionally weak part of the cycle."
"1271220","1273100"," Claiming that it's that it's like bad. "
"1273420","1275620"," Like it's bad bad bad doom and gloom."
"1277740","1279020"," I'm like wait a minute here."
"1279240","1280720"," You know we brought up SNL. "
"1280880","1281560"," So I went back and looked."
"1282760","1284840"," And I'm like the fucking market squeezed."
"1287220","1290360"," The market didn't come back to see a low. "
"1290360","1293280"," And the market squeezed faces off."
"1293960","1294360"," For years."
"1296500","1299460"," And if you are old enough you remember that the SNL crisis. "
"1301160","1302500"," Was considered worse."
"1304180","1305380"," Then the Great Depression."
"1308200","1309000"," So. "
"1310180","1311840"," Let's get back to rate increases."
"1313020","1314660"," These same sharks."
"1315480","1317480"," These same vigilantes. "
"1317480","1322080"," I know have their eyes on commercial real estate."
"1322820","1325840"," We've been talking about that non stop here."
"1326480","1329240"," For months now right month two months. "
"1329280","1331860"," It's been a been our conversation every week."
"1335140","1339000"," And did that we ain't done in commercial real estate."
"1339680","1340540"," That's it. "
"1340740","1344340"," You're going to see it this summer."
"1344340","1347560"," My assumption here is that the Fed knows this."
"1348240","1351320"," And you've got a regional bank CEO getting fat. "
"1351980","1357780"," And you've got people in the background right the vigilantes know they can create shit."
"1359680","1364520"," And you know that there's some commercial real estate CEOs they don't give a fuck."
"1365020","1366300"," If their company goes under. "
"1367140","1368120"," If their company gets rated."
"1368800","1370040"," If their company gets taken over."
"1370540","1371380"," It's all money and greed. "
"1374500","1379600"," And so if this is set up for the summer time with the commercial real estate because we know that"
"1379600","1380220"," traditionally."
"1380980","1383120"," Real estate starts to get weak next."
"1384600","1385860"," We know this. "
"1388220","1389500"," And so when we look back."
"1391440","1392480"," In history."
"1393720","1397700"," And we know that there's there's greed right greed is good. "
"1399400","1402800"," The old movie Wall Street not the bullshit the new one they made."
"1403220","1404600"," I'm talking about the one from the eighties."
"1406920","1408420"," So we know that's coming. "
"1408760","1411240"," And you know what else knows that's coming Jerome Powell."
"1412080","1414160"," They got the debt sale in bullshit."
"1415540","1416020"," Scam. "
"1417720","1418960"," To create wall."
"1419840","1421080"," Measure and dick contest."
"1424440","1425500"," So what do you do?"
"1425500","1426260"," What do you do?"
"1426260","1427920"," You know it's coming. "
"1428320","1429540"," And he knows it's coming."
"1431460","1433740"," So there's a couple things that'll likely happen."
"1433940","1436040"," We already know that they support the banks. "
"1436540","1440000"," We already know that they're likely going to support commercial real estate."
"1440980","1444380"," And you're a CEO and you're some fat guy like Bill Ackman."
"1446320","1447440"," And Jamie Diamond. "
"1448040","1448580"," What are you going to do?"
"1449600","1450620"," You take the money and run."
"1451400","1453180"," And he's going to have to support this shit."
"1453180","1456120"," And the balance sheet is going to go up because of that. "
"1456340","1458820"," I don't want to hear any of your arguments so they're not printing money anymore."
"1459000","1459540"," I don't want to hear it."
"1460400","1465460"," I read the details and when they were removing money from the system and they were warehousing that"
"1465460","1465760"," shit. "
"1466700","1470000"," They were sending it to auction and whatever wasn't fucking bought."
"1470420","1473140"," They were putting it to the side for the next two to three generations."
"1474000","1476260"," Public knowledge just nobody reads that shit. "
"1476800","1478040"," But it comes off the books."
"1479140","1480940"," So they created all this fucking money."
"1482600","1486120"," Then on the sheet it shows that it's gone but it's not. "
"1487040","1491660"," And whatever they need to they're going to pull it out and they're going to support the system."
"1491980","1493440"," And that's what they did with the regional banks."
"1494100","1496700"," And that's what they're planning on doing with commercial real estate. "
"1498700","1504080"," And so even if they were to raise rates this summer, it ain't going to fucking matter because the"
"1504080","1507540"," balance sheet's going to go up and that's going to make the stock market go up."
"1508360","1509400"," Higher for longer."
"1511700","1516520"," Just when you thought that we were in agreements until we got into the regional banking crisis,"
"1517040","1518220"," they fucked you. "
"1518820","1520940"," They fucked Jim Bob on Main Street."
"1522120","1523220"," They fucked a bear."
"1524400","1526500"," They fucked a bull that wants a bottom in the market. "
"1526960","1530560"," They fucked everybody and said, hey man, hold on a second USA."
"1533360","1535260"," We got to do a bunch of raid in here."
"1536840","1538280"," We're not ready to go up. "
"1540540","1542040"," We're not ready for a bottom."
"1544980","1548000"," In this cycle we're going to go in and we're going to raid all these banks."
"1548200","1552320"," We're going to raid all these mid-sized commercial real estate firms. "
"1552820","1554320"," And we're going to go from company to company."
"1557960","1558980"," We're going to raid them."
"1559160","1560940"," It's going to take us a year to three years. "
"1564800","1566380"," So you're going to hold on."
"1566560","1567740"," You're going to deal with inflation."
"1570850","1579010"," And by the way, whenever that next election cycle comes up, we might not even get a bottom because"
"1579010","1582270"," you'll get a new president and you'll get a new Senate and they're going to promise you they're"
"1582270","1588410"," going to pay everybody more money, cut taxes and make a new economy. "
"1590190","1594330"," So there might be this big chance where we don't even get a bottom."
"1600080","1601640"," You might just accept it."
"1613640","1615380"," So do we get a rate cut this summer?"
"1615680","1616020"," Possible. "
"1616500","1618620"," Will it matter if we get an unrate cut or rate increase?"
"1618800","1618940"," Possible."
"1619560","1619880"," Likely."
"1620420","1620540"," No. "
"1621500","1622600"," Because they're going to have to do some supporting."
"1622880","1626020"," Now if they do, if they're like, well, we're doing some support into the balance sheets coming up."
"1626380","1627980"," So we'll throw another rate hike on there. "
"1628040","1629640"," That just equals everything else."
"1630240","1631180"," Does that make sense?"
"1633440","1634860"," It doesn't like create crash."
"1636060","1640420"," If you're a bull out there, you can easily easily go out there. "
"1640660","1642640"," We got the employment rate going down again."
"1643760","1646820"," We got the inverted yield curve that's going to go down again."
"1649040","1651760"," You're looking for something if you're like a crash person. "
"1653720","1655700"," You're looking for the unemployment rate to skyrocket."
"1657100","1658740"," You're looking for rates cuts."
"1659240","1659640"," Believe me. "
"1661060","1662000"," We've looked at it."
"1663020","1664820"," Till I'm throwing up over it."
"1665640","1670120"," Or I don't want to look at it ever again right now because I could ask oftentimes about it. "
"1670140","1671120"," And I'm like, we've done this for."
"1671480","1673720"," We've been looking at this shit now for two months."
"1673900","1675660"," I said, when I had my last office in my other house. "
"1677260","1679060"," And I told you that a year ago."
"1681040","1681880"," We're in May."
"1682320","1684540"," It was talking about you this last fucking June. "
"1684540","1688420"," So, you know, we looked at those things."
"1688780","1691720"," And when they go to front run them, you're looking for a rate cut."
"1692780","1693540"," Rampant unemployment. "
"1695640","1700220"," Those are the only two fucking things that are consistent."
"1702600","1703460"," Rate cuts."
"1704740","1704860"," Unemployment. "
"1706020","1706140"," Raging."
"1708760","1713340"," And if you have never experienced that in your life, if you've never lived through watching your"
"1713340","1714340"," dad go through it."
"1714540","1717800"," Or your mom or your neighborhood. "
"1719780","1725160"," If you've never lived anywhere where it's filthy rich and the filthy rich disappear."
"1725940","1726700"," I don't mean old money."
"1726900","1729880"," I mean like this new money that every cycle has. "
"1733530","1738550"," If you don't see grown men losing their wives, kids, living out of their car."
"1742150","1746370"," If you don't see people that think they're going to have a job, especially that middle management."
"1749270","1753350"," People that think their jobs are safe when they lose their jobs, you don't see your whole"
"1753350","1753750"," neighborhood. "
"1755110","1756670"," One third of it is empty."
"1758470","1759510"," Lawns not mowed."
"1759730","1760730"," Lawns turn in yellow. "
"1762670","1766270"," Until you see that, you ain't seeing your rollover in the market."
"1767190","1768250"," The one that you're looking for."
"1774060","1775460"," And right now they're putting it on pause. "
"1778420","1779700"," They got shit to do."
"1781380","1783220"," They're going to do some raiding here."
"1787480","1787980"," Gross. "
"1789740","1791560"," They broke the contract with you."
"1791620","1793260"," I told you they broke the contract with you."
"1793640","1798240"," The moment they supported those banks that came on this stream and I told you, they broke the"
"1798240","1799580"," fucking contract with you. "
"1803570","1804510"," That's what they did."
"1809200","1810820"," You're welcome on the bull plane alert."
"1815980","1816720"," It's gross. "
"1817080","1817540"," It's disgusting."
"1819860","1825060"," And you see it and it's like, man, it's like a Zamboni just rolling down the ice."
"1825840","1827420"," You're just like, here it comes. "
"1829240","1831260"," The scam, the fraud goes on."
"1832640","1834020"," And then you're in real time."
"1834200","1837740"," The age of the internet, the age of live streaming, the age of YouTube. "
"1839060","1842140"," Twitter fintuit like old school Yahoo was."
"1844260","1847120"," All the apps out there, all the tools out there."
"1847120","1851480"," All the web hooks, all the data and the information getting around as fast as possible. "
"1852120","1853200"," Very clean looking."
"1854120","1856860"," You're seeing it in real time, not having to read a spreadsheet."
"1866340","1870030"," My Friday rant, baby. "
"1871310","1872470"," Made some bank."
"1880570","1882130"," John Harry chiming in."
"1882230","1887630"," I couldn't convince my deskmate to buy shitty bank shares for $1 in 2008. "
"1890950","1896710"," Yesterday, Winky and I had a long conversation about this in stream in the middle of the day."
"1897130","1898430"," It was an important conversation."
"1899290","1907270"," Bob Kendall last night went on a rant about that same conversation we had yesterday. "
"1908210","1912690"," I don't think he was watching, but he, well, I'm not the only one."
"1913030","1914390"," And Winky's not the only one."
"1914690","1917010"," And Joe, Joe Donut's not the only one. "
"1917750","1919470"," And John Hagerty's not the only one."
"1919470","1923410"," All these old fucks have seen this before."
"1931070","1933170"," I made a post on Twitter last night. "
"1934470","1936150"," I think it was last night."
"1936250","1937450"," I think I made a post on Twitter."
"1939710","1941990"," I was like, I didn't show a chart. "
"1942350","1950430"," But if you look at the regional banks in January, right, we came into the end of January, the short"
"1950430","1952410"," was on in the end of January."
"1952410","1954670"," I didn't see shit."
"1957370","1963890"," I didn't see a fucking parade anywhere, anywhere short regional banks. "
"1966150","1969710"," Winky's been telling me this single sentence for a month."
"1970870","1973410"," I never knew what SVB was."
"1976150","1977770"," I trade banks all the time. "
"1977890","1978650"," It was never on my radar."
"1978650","1982710"," I know Winky's out there watching what's out there."
"1982810","1983870"," I know all of us do. "
"1986170","1991210"," So the short was in two months ago, and it wasn't public."
"1992130","1998370"," But right now, the bandwagon is cell banks, cell banks, cell banks, cell banks, cell banks, cell"
"1998370","2000670"," banks, cell banks, cell banks, everywhere, cell banks, cell banks."
"2003270","2013970"," When the short was January 31, And while this cacophony is going ballistic, no"
"2013970","2018410"," one is band wagging jumping by banks. "
"2019650","2021930"," Or which banks do we buy?"
"2022690","2026030"," Or do we buy these ten shitty banks?"
"2027630","2030870"," And we have three of them get destroyed, right?"
"2031570","2034790"," We have an FRC that blows up, okay, so I lost on FRC."
"2034790","2041210"," But the other seven in two, three years are probably going to be cranking, get bought out"
"2041210","2041610"," something."
"2042630","2048550"," That doesn't mean you buy it today either, but in these past couple weeks, there should be like,"
"2048770","2054889"," there should be like a like a raging chorus from retail saying, what the fuck are we going to buy?"

"2056110","2057010"," Which ones are we going to lose?"
"2060210","2064010"," I'm on the phone with Joe Donut yesterday and we're talking about Schwab. "
"2065889","2070370"," When Schwab first got sold, Winky, Joe and I were like, what the fuck is going on?"
"2074889","2082449"," It's short, it's people that want it cheap, corporate rating, share rating, it's not going"
"2082449","2082949"," bankrupt."
"2085170","2088170"," And even if it did go bankrupt, it's a scam."
"2089409","2099910"," Now trading 410.46, one minute, five minute hourly, daily trigger, max bullishness, trading"
"2099910","2109910"," up to R3 right now, 410.48. You know what the fucked up"
"2109910","2115030"," part about all this is, the thing that got my ass and the overnight thing that I was pissed off"
"2115030","2118970"," last night, and I was pissed off because I was like, you know what's really pissing me off?"
"2120310","2123770"," I was like, you know, this is not a message for young traders. "
"2123910","2129870"," If you're a young trader and you get like 1,000 bucks, 10,000 bucks, 50,000 bucks, $100,000,"
"2130650","2131350"," you're a young trader."
"2131610","2132350"," This doesn't apply to you."
"2133410","2142150"," But if you're an old trader and you've like accumulated some fucking money, you must, I'm not worn,"
"2142290","2143070"," this is like a lesson. "
"2145070","2153630"," You must be able to graduate into the next cycle and it is not easy."
"2154850","2162850"," You're going to be surrounded by a cacophony of negativity"
"2162850","2170170"," and you need to be like waiting through this pile of shit"
"2170170","2178070"," because if you're going to put some money and invest this market for the next bull cycle bull run"
"2178070","2185220"," that will happen, you don't have to actually be that tactful."
"2185320","2189260"," If that shit's so cheap, you can just buy 10 bank stocks and let it sit for 10 years. "
"2190620","2197140"," But if you have money, you can still day trade and swing trade and do all this other shit that"
"2197140","2197740"," we're in a bull run."
"2197880","2200580"," But right now, this is your go time."
"2200660","2201860"," This is your show time. "

"2212860","2218440"," This is your time to be looking at the piece of shit that traded down to 80 cents and didn't"
"2218440","2222040"," get delusted so you can buy and hold. "
"2222040","2226280"," Now, I do agree like some companies, man, they're not going to make it."
"2229930","2234350"," But there are some companies that will make it that will go through an M&A where you will get"
"2234350","2234730"," paid."
"2235950","2241730"," And if you, if you like that, that's too risky cap, well, three fucking 45 on S&P 500 is"
"2241730","2242190"," not risky. "
"2242610","2243650"," That shouldn't go bankrupt."
"2266360","2272520"," VNQ, who knows what VNQ is, Vanguard Realty Trust."
"2274100","2277480"," If that rolls over this summer, that ain't going bankrupt. "

"2671390","2674030"," Winky, if you can hear me, brother, just say something. "
"2678940","2679640"," Wait a minute."
"2679740","2679960"," Wait a minute."
"2679960","2680240"," Hold on. "
"2680680","2682560"," Winky, go ahead."
"2683980","2684940"," Hey, what's up, everybody?"
"2684940","2685660"," Hey."
"2689460","2691980"," How's it going, man?"
"2692800","2693400"," Good. "
"2694160","2699880"," So I've been thinking about this whole bank feedback loop where everybody's connected globally to"
"2699880","2701920"," all the information all the time."
"2702740","2706320"," And man, I'm really like, they got it."
"2706480","2711460"," I think the regulators are going to have to do something to kind of like curve the shorts because,"
"2711920","2714400"," okay, so let's all use a real world example. "
"2714400","2722200"," So I had $25,000 in an affirmative savings account because it was like 2.5% and this was"
"2722200","2724860"," when everything else was zero, right?"
"2725100","2731200"," So like they did something weird where like their earnings release came out like early or"
"2731200","2731420"," something."
"2731720","2737140"," They posted a tweet or did something like in the market that I didn't like and I just ripped all"
"2737140","2737980"," my money out of it."
"2737980","2745460"," So like, I think the fact that like everybody's watching the bank that they have all their money in"
"2745460","2753460"," at all times is, I don't know, like that's going to create a pretty sticky situation, I think, for"
"2753460","2753840"," the banks. "
"2754860","2759200"," You saw the outflows and inflows into the large prime banks past month or so."
"2759240","2760960"," If you saw those numbers, seen those numbers yet."
"2761320","2762280"," Yeah, I've seen it. "
"2762280","2770080"," It's like some of the little banks that are pretty much on the fringe saw some outflows, but most"
"2770080","2776220"," of the banks like Fifth Third and Huntington and the ones that like, I would be more interested in"
"2776220","2780900"," playing around with Schwab, you know, like, I don't really know that Schwab's even a regional bank,"
"2781100","2787580"," but but yeah, I have them watching that."
"2787760","2793460"," Yeah, and it seems like they're targeting the right ones for the deposit withdrawals."
"2796710","2797850"," Joe donut. "
"2801800","2807140"," His dad moved a bunch of money into a fund."
"2808180","2811420"," It was a guaranteed five percent money market fund."
"2811920","2814460"," It was like five percent every month or something. "
"2815600","2817140"," I'm trying to find out right now."
"2817580","2819520"," If he can post something about it in stream."
"2824700","2830620"," Yeah, but so like basically, I think what's going to happen is if they, if people keep short in the"
"2830620","2833780"," banks and rating them to use your term, which I think is appropriate. "
"2834380","2840360"," If the market keeps rating the banks and then you're a depositor and you just see like, oh, the"
"2840360","2846620"," stock of your banks, like Zions or whatever went down 38% in one day, you're going to be like,"
"2846620","2848260"," maybe I should take all my money out of there."
"2848260","2848480"," Right."
"2848740","2854460"," And then then you're going to see the deposits go down and then someone else is going to be like,"
"2854460","2856040"," oh, I need to take all my money out. "
"2856040","2858480"," And then they basically Zions is worth zero."
"2858960","2867620"," So like they have to take their finger off of, you know, like, I don't see what like stops it"
"2867620","2868940"," in this era."
"2869060","2873180"," Like 20 years ago, like nobody knew like bank one was having trouble. "
"2873180","2874300"," Nobody knew about that."
"2874300","2882280"," Like, like Warren Buffett was the only guy that even like was looking at the balance sheets back"
"2882280","2883120"," then, you know what I mean?"
"2883360","2887540"," Like, but everybody everybody is getting all the information about everything all at once."
"2887540","2892440"," So it's, it's actually pretty easy to do this stuff. "
"2892480","2897660"," These, it's like way easier now to like cause a complete panic than it used to be."
"2898000","2898500"," I would think."
"2900560","2904160"," Well, I just got so Joe just sent me a link to the fund. "
"2904560","2906660"," I just posted it on fin to it on Twitter."
"2907300","2911720"," So if any of you are looking for a link to it, Joe said that he would come into the"
"2911720","2913780"," stream on either Twitch or YouTube."
"2914520","2917160"," And answer any questions people have about it. "
"2917160","2922460"," So like John Hagerty, Binky, any of you guys out there that are interested in this fund."
"2923500","2925780"," It looks like Joe Donner will be in stream."
"2926760","2930040"," If anyone's interested in that fund and that's Charles Schwab product. "
"2936780","2942740"," That, you know, I'm looking at, so this morning I was looking at a regional real estate or housing"
"2942740","2944480"," at real estate ETFs."
"2944500","2945440"," And then I said, no, fuck this."
"2945520","2949320"," I'm just going to go down and start down the rabbit hole on regional commercial bank stocks. "
"2951140","2958140"," Do you think you mean like regional banks with the most lending exposure to commercial real estate?"
"2960920","2962520"," Yeah, so I pulled a bunch of tech."
"2962620","2963900"," I think I've got 10 tickers."
"2964720","2967040"," And I was figuring that over the weekend that I would. "
"2967560","2969960"," I had a few tickers that I had researched before."
"2970900","2974580"," But I was like, yeah, let's start digging in on some of these like midsize."
"2975260","2978840"," Do you think that will have a commercial real estate crisis this summer or fall?"
"2979020","2983060"," Or do you think that's someone else was telling me that because we know it's going to happen or"
"2983060","2984680"," maybe I don't know if that was you or somebody else was saying. "
"2985060","2987360"," If they know it's going to happen, it's not going to happen."
"2987360","2992820"," I mean, it'll be true to some extent, just like anything else in this market is, right?"
"2993100","2993200"," Yeah."
"2993740","2998520"," Like maybe it's not a hundred percent true, but 28% sure. "
"2999140","3005400"," I would say there are a couple of specific stocks and segments I would stay away from if you're"
"3005400","3007260"," thinking about shorting commercial real estate."
"3008580","3015160"," One thing I learned during 2020 is that you never short SPG, which is Simon Property Group, which"
"3015160","3019220"," is one of the best malls and the mall operators in the universe, basically."
"3020240","3027340"," And like since that company has existed, there have been like 20 reasons that it should have gone"
"3027340","3029620"," out of business and just disappeared. "
"3030380","3035640"," But like no matter what happens, the CEO keeps that thing like humming along."
"3035640","3040180"," So, if you're thinking about shorting malls, if you're thinking about shorting malls, I would"
"3040180","3042620"," definitely look at like Mesa Rich, which is MAC."
"3044480","3050040"," As far as office building, large office building reads, I don't really, I haven't really done the"
"3050040","3050280"," research. "
"3050500","3052360"," I really need to get up to seed like you were saying."
"3053020","3055800"," I also really wouldn't short in general."
"3057360","3059620"," Data center stocks, like Equinix. "
"3060780","3062440"," Yeah, I got them on my list, I think."
"3062740","3063960"," Digital Realty Trust."
"3065120","3065940"," I've got them on my list. "
"3066220","3072720"," Those companies tend to like have kind of their own, I don't know, I want to say vibe as far"
"3072720","3075360"," as like commercial real estate goes."
"3075920","3077880"," They don't work from home on that shit, are they?"
"3078600","3083540"," Yeah, I mean, those are just like data, like that's only going to ever grow, basically."
"3083540","3089720"," So, I would just focus on like, find like the worst office building. "
"3090020","3091900"," I don't, did we work to a public again?"
"3093620","3095160"," I think they're on my list."
"3095560","3096380"," Yeah, they did."
"3096380","3098280"," I'll share my list when I have it done. "
"3098520","3101760"," I've got like, I've got 10 of them right now and I have to go have to dig through them."
"3101760","3103040"," I think we work was on it."
"3103640","3105920"," Goddamn, we work is 44 cents. "
"3107240","3109480"," I've got, I've got a list of them here in the background."
"3110240","3110920"," That's hilarious."
"3111340","3113380"," Well, that's, I mean, that's probably where it is served to be. "
"3113500","3114140"," So you can't show up."
"3114220","3116680"," We work because what is it going to do to 27 cents?"
"3117760","3119520"," But, uh, no, I haven't looked at."
"3119600","3125820"," I've got like, uh, I've got O refi BP YPP CBRE. "
"3126800","3129280"," Yeah, CBRE is a pretty good one too."
"3129740","3132180"," They got ACRE CSGP."
"3132820","3133880"," I got a bunch of others too. "
"3133880","3135440"," R YR."
"3135640","3137940"," You might want to add MAC to that list?"
"3138320","3138720"," At CTF."
"3139000","3139900"," Oh, well, now I get the list done. "
"3140040","3141020"," I'll, I'll share with you."
"3141340","3141940"," Cool man."
"3142380","3147020"," And we can look at even deeper and see, see what we can, we can drag up on that. "
"3147120","3148060"," You know, it's a thing too."
"3148080","3153120"," Is I remember any text to you about the White House investigating short sellers in Suck down that."
"3153240","3153860"," That's what I was saying. "
"3154220","3157200"," Like they, they kind of have to, like do some."
"3157420","3159980"," It's way too easy to create this feedback loop on banks."
"3159980","3162600"," like, I can't believe they haven't done it before. "
"3163500","3166520"," Like, just, it's just so easy."
"3166740","3168340"," Yeah, so you never just mentioned it right here."
"3168340","3172320"," You just said, well, the press today is already laying the groundwork for banning short selling on"
"3172320","3172580"," banks. "
"3172620","3175380"," You can see it a mile away, blaming short selling on the collapse openly."
"3176580","3177920"," Yeah, I mean, that's all it is."
"3178020","3182920"," I mean, like, okay, some of the, like SIVB and FRC were obviously in trouble. "
"3183620","3189500"," But the, like, top tier ones, they're, they're fortresses, basically."
"3189940","3193480"," Like, I mean, it's just, it's kind of absurd."
"3193840","3195240"," I mean, I'm taking advantage of it. "
"3195260","3199320"," Like, yesterday, I bought tons of carry and a bunch of other bank stocks that I really like."
"3199520","3204800"," And then today I just flipped them and made some money, you know, but like, I don't know if they're"
"3204800","3210700"," going to get away with it a third time because I feel like this is basically the second big short"
"3210700","3214620"," wave on the regional banks was like yesterday and earlier this week."
"3215260","3218540"," But I don't know if they're going to get that third push or not. "
"3218800","3223840"," I haven't, I got to do a lot more work on that because either the White House or Congress is"
"3223840","3227740"," going to ban something or, you know, even if it's only temporary."
"3228320","3230040"," Yeah, I mean, it's going to be temporary."
"3230340","3235860"," I think they actually made it illegal to ban short financials and other times, too. "
"3235980","3238160"," I think it was during the financial crisis."
"3238620","3239640"," Yeah, they were, they did."
"3239880","3242600"," They, they, they might even ban all short selling. "
"3242940","3243600"," They banned it all."
"3243880","3246980"," And yeah, I think Bob Kendall said something last night."
"3246980","3252600"," What did he say that he piqued my interest on something last night along that line?"
"3253880","3256940"," I forget what it was now if it comes back to me, I try to remember it. "
"3256940","3259960"," But there was something else that the peak managers that I was like, I remember that tuned."
"3261700","3266020"," There's something about Oh, he was saying about the naked shorting and he's like, there's, there's"
"3266020","3267340"," guaranteed there's naked shorting right now."
"3267480","3271320"," And he made a point that there aren't even shares too short right now. "
"3271320","3276260"," And people are still able to get short of like different dealer brokers aren't don't even have you"
"3276260","3277680"," can't even short them openly short."
"3277900","3279640"," Some of these regional banks at this point."
"3280200","3285900"," So there's got to be some synthetic shorts are like a not some a ton of synthetic shorts out there. "
"3285940","3290960"," And some dealers though, a few small dealers are still offering even though there's none available."
"3291740","3297300"," Yeah, I mean, it's, I mean, there's something going on like they're companies like that aren't"
"3297300","3301360"," supposed to move another like that they're not supposed to move like that."
"3301480","3306540"," But another good industry to kind of keep your eye on would be like insurance too to see if there's"
"3306540","3316400"," like broader financial weakness because they're not technically banks, but they benefit"
"3316400","3322160"," and suffer a lot of the same ways because of how they invest the money that they take in from"
"3322160","3324540"," premiums and turned into like payouts. "
"3326060","3333620"," So they can also be a thing if somebody finds an insurance company that they can, you know, make"
"3333620","3339620"," look like they have no capital, like then this whole thing will start again in that industry as"
"3339620","3339840"," well."
"3340560","3342040"," What are your thoughts on today?"
"3342200","3344040"," Do you think we go up there and tag that H line or no?"
"3344840","3352320"," Like I can't really even speculate because I was firmly in the camp that we'd hit 420 by today,"
"3352320","3355540"," like for five weeks."
"3355700","3359560"," I guess I've kind of been like thinking that that was the way. "
"3359880","3361040"," So I'm not even going to guess."
"3361380","3363820"," Do you think the 4200 qualifies on ES or no?"
"3365180","3370180"," I would have to see like the technicals and I would look at SPX for that."
"3370520","3378140"," But I don't, I mean, we, there was one day where you were talking about why you thought 420 ish"
"3378140","3383260"," was a reasonable target and that they might even bounce above it because they wanted to make sure"
"3383260","3383820"," or whatever. "
"3384060","3385880"," So we're at 417."
"3386200","3387480"," We were up there at 417."
"3387820","3392540"," We tagged for 4200 or 4206. "
"3393280","3395560"," I believe don't hold me this if you're in the chat right now to the exacts."
"3395620","3396360"," It's probably right."
"3396520","3402860"," But you know, looking back in time without reading anything, I believe you tagged 4206 on ES. "
"3402860","3404320"," That's when they triggered the cell."
"3404820","3406860"," My thing here is not even 420."
"3407380","3411420"," It's my thing here is 430 due to the JPM caller. "
"3411700","3420520"," Well, yeah, but see like my thesis was basically based on that to too high of 418.31, which they"
"3420520","3423540"," at that point, everybody wanted to hit 420."
"3423940","3424860"," It was all over CNBC."
"3425500","3428060"," They were going to push it up that last day. "
"3428480","3428660"," Yeah."
"3428720","3430260"," And then that was the end of that run."
"3430640","3433700"," And I figured this time why even get to 417. "
"3434380","3439380"," If you aren't going to take a stab at that high, like what's even the why even go all the"
"3439380","3440040"," way back up there."
"3440620","3445320"," Just not even even if you get by a tick, like you do the high by one tick, even if"
"3445320","3446280"," you come back down for support."
"3446500","3446940"," Yeah. "
"3447400","3453440"," I mean, why even why go to 417 and not go to 418.31. Yeah, there's like that one more"
"3453440","3454120"," tick above it."
"3454120","3457620"," At least like you get that tick, you find the support, you run back up and then you hit the"
"3457620","3459180"," 420 and then we do like 430."
"3460460","3465060"," I thought we'd do 430 sometime in, I believe, late May. "
"3466160","3467920"," Late May or June, we hit 430."
"3469100","3477100"," But then looking on the on a larger timeframe, like the year by like you had some targets above of"
"3477100","3480780"," 460, even up to 470."
"3480860","3482260"," I believe in maybe even 490. "
"3483140","3489600"," But the way that the the channels is right now, it looks like we could just be tagging like 430"
"3489600","3494300"," all year long, like 430, then 435, then 431."
"3494860","3496700"," Yeah, I mean, I would agree with that."
"3496740","3505620"," A lot of people were saying that we're in a flat just sideways market, but I don't I honestly and"
"3505620","3511560"," I've been saying this since I've known you basically and like, I still don't see an earnings"
"3511560","3512740"," recession necessarily. "
"3513420","3518380"," And a lot of people will push back on me and say, well, that's because estimates have come down so"
"3518380","3521100"," low that it's impossible for them to miss."
"3521500","3523180"," I don't really think that's true, honestly."
"3523840","3530480"," I think that companies are still doing really well, just like everybody, just like all the people"
"3530480","3536280"," that lived through COVID, companies that are still around lived through that shit, they became"
"3536280","3540280"," basically tanks for lack of a better word. "
"3541280","3545940"," And it's going to take an awful lot to bring them down."
"3546160","3551700"," I mean, people have learned from COVID, like, you know, all the stores that were shut down and"
"3551700","3556040"," stuff, man, like if they get shut down again, they're not they're going to have a playbook for all"
"3556040","3556460"," that shit."
"3556460","3559740"," So like, I just don't care. "
"3559840","3560700"," I got something for you, Winky."
"3561020","3561780"," Go for it."
"3562000","3570020"," In the in the chat of YouTube and in the chat of YouTube and Twitch, I'm going to post a"
"3570020","3573700"," link to an archived article that came out on MarketWatch. "
"3575340","3580180"," So if you guys don't own a market watch subscription, and you've what if you read your three"
"3580180","3588640"," articles for the week, here's a free version of that article posting it right now in Twitch and in"
"3588640","3592080"," YouTube chat, just click on it."
"3592160","3594700"," It's not clickbait or anything or I don't know."
"3594980","3597800"," It doesn't lead to like feet picks for not a phishing link. "
"3597920","3599220"," Yeah, it's not a phishing thing."
"3599740","3601000"," It's archive.com."
"3601340","3603700"," And you guys don't know what archive is that archives the internet."
"3604220","3608320"," It lets you view the way back machine is what it used to be called. "
"3608740","3612840"," Yeah, if yeah, what it does have you if you're like, if you don't pay for a Wall Street Journal"
"3612840","3618140"," subscription, you can post a link to an article there, it'll archive it and you can read it for"
"3618140","3618460"," free."
"3619560","3621380"," The article is about."
"3623460","3628440"," So by the way, the companies that I listed earlier, those aren't companies that I'm going to short"
"3628440","3630220"," those are a list of companies to research. "
"3630380","3632320"," So we have to go into those."
"3633340","3634620"," You can't short this one."
"3634700","3635380"," You can't short that one. "
"3635440","3637920"," I'm like, we got a list easy, easy."
"3638420","3642340"," Well, I mean, Simon property group is going to be around in 10 years."
"3642520","3642660"," Yeah. "
"3645230","3650490"," This article that I just posted for you to read out there, if you go through it, there's an"
"3650490","3656910"," average, there's a chart down there about average cumulative stock market performance for the past"
"3656910","3658270"," six hiking campaigns."
"3659710","3660770"," You should look at that."
"3661830","3667630"," And then there's another one below it called world stock market returns for various periods after"
"3667630","3670650"," last fed hike for each cycle. "
"3671270","3674630"," And it shows first, second, third, fourth week, 90 day full return."
"3675330","3679390"," What's fascinating is financials shine."
"3680710","3682250"," And that no, wait a minute to have that right. "
"3682530","3686090"," Yeah, I think, but the NASDAQ lead comes ahead."
"3687350","3688670"," So read that our equipment."
"3689390","3694130"," You know, that's be 500 for his various cycles, each last fed hike to be in shows to you right"
"3694130","3695010"," here real quick, Winky. "
"3695250","3695650"," Can you see?"
"3695650","3696330"," I haven't read."
"3696330","3701750"," I haven't read through the entire article, but the first thing I found completely interesting was"
"3701750","3704090"," the people that they asked the comment."
"3705090","3714890"," It's Bill Ackman, Jeffrey Gunlock, you know, Mike O'Rourke, all these like market guys that"
"3714890","3720230"," are short, all these banks are like, I can't believe Jay Powell said that the banks are resilient. "
"3721590","3722210"," Right here."
"3722310","3723890"," This is the one that I'll point your attention to."
"3724170","3725330"," I believe this is the right one. "
"3725930","3728850"," Returns for various periods after last fed hike for each cycle."
"3729630","3729710"," Right."
"3730190","3736110"," Yeah, you want to keep your eyes, I believe on things like financials are at 12%. "
"3736110","3744910"," And at the end of this of the cycle, uh, tech catches back up 14 points,"
"3744910","3746810"," 61%."
"3746810","3750510"," That's a 90 days full return."
"3751310","3760720"," So if we price in a pause, my, my pause it here is if we price in a pause and"
"3760720","3765300"," if we price in, uh, that doesn't mean we don't rate hikes again. "
"3766000","3769300"," What we do in this mark, any market is we price something in."
"3769760","3774820"," If it doesn't happen, we take the money back out of the market before it happens."
"3774820","3778240"," We do it before any of this stuff actually takes place. "
"3778420","3781480"," So if we, it, Jay Powell, I don't care what you read out there."
"3781540","3785320"," If you watch that, that presser, that was a fucking pause on a cut."
"3785480","3786280"," That was a pause. "
"3787340","3790960"," He was too wishy washy when he said it wasn't a pause."
"3791560","3794300"," He later answered multiple times that it was."
"3794720","3796760"," Now do I think we're going to raise rates again?"
"3796900","3802280"," I do, but if they're going to price in some kind of a pause through the summer, uh, I guess"
"3802280","3808440"," that's my question is, uh, do, do we get those returns or near those returns, six percent, eight"
"3808440","3811480"," percent, maybe not 14, uh, in 90 days?"
"3811600","3812760"," That's where you get your 430. "
"3813300","3817840"," I guess that, that's kind of backing up that I, that, that pause it that maybe we do get 430."
"3819540","3823720"," Do you disagree with that or I forget what the big thing is this data doesn't come from Bill"
"3823720","3824060"," Ackman."
"3824300","3824680"," Right. "
"3825120","3830200"," I know the data doesn't, but all the people that were commenting and basically bitching about Jay"
"3830200","3835820"," Powell's statement were like billionaire people who are all bonds and short stars."
"3836560","3842180"," So, yeah, of course they're going to be like, that was, that was appalling what he did."
"3842840","3844820"," Um, yeah. "
"3845240","3848380"," I don't want their bonds to print."
"3848780","3850220"," So like, here's my problem."
"3850220","3850580"," Okay. "
"3850840","3854280"," So we got October to May shorts don't pay, right?"
"3854760","3854900"," Yeah."
"3855000","3861120"," So like, it would be a magical surprise if, let's say in the middle of June, we're at 430."
"3861800","3865520"," I don't think anybody is really necessarily positive. "
"3865780","3870960"," I mean, maybe you are, I don't know, but I'm not necessarily positioned for that."
"3871380","3872260"," I'm positioned for it."
"3872340","3872620"," I know you. "
"3872720","3873040"," I'm right now."
"3873660","3874140"," Yeah."
"3874500","3875520"," I'm also an IWM. "
"3875520","3884560"," Um, I, so you think like any rally that's related to that is going to hit the small caps first?"
"3885180","3891820"," I think that I'm trying to, I'm trying to buy, or I'm trying to capture premium on that and, you"
"3891820","3898740"," know, when you look at when you, I think like, it's like we talked about before, in this, in this"
"3898740","3906360"," day and age, uh, for you to really, uh, get a leg up over the market at large."
"3907320","3912840"," Um, if you just look at S&P 500 in small caps, there is some outperform and even NASDAQ, there"
"3912840","3913880"," is some outperformant stuff."
"3914660","3917460"," Uh, but, uh, small caps have been underperforming. "
"3917900","3919420"," We haven't rotated into them yet."
"3920020","3921000"," They have earnings coming up."
"3921680","3925520"," Oh, but it still generally follows the same track as the S&P 500 and the cues. "
"3925980","3928780"," Cues still generally follow the same track as S&P 500."
"3929840","3934600"," Uh, if it, for you to get a leg up in this market, you know that we have to look"
"3934600","3942180"," for something like regional banking crisis and find, and find the tickers that didn't deserve to"
"3942180","3945020"," get whacked, even if the market's continuing higher, right?"
"3945420","3949200"," At all, like markets going higher, regional banks aren't for, aren't participating."
"3950260","3955520"," So for you to get a leg up, if everybody's making money in S&P 500 or cues, you have"
"3955520","3957060"," to find, uh, the deals. "
"3957380","3959380"," Yeah, you got to find the, uh, the stinker."
"3959840","3962480"," Yeah, that, yeah, exactly the stinker than the next one."
"3962480","3965960"," Yeah, find the, the trash that's gold or, you know, whatever you want to call it. "
"3967100","3967500"," Exactly."
"3967540","3967800"," Yeah."
"3968560","3973100"," And, uh, or you're, I mean, that's why we do the spec, that's why I do the spec growth, uh,"
"3973500","3977820"," IPO companies that IPO three years ago, and you know, it's fucked up, not fucked up, but I try to"
"3977820","3984960"," run those scans on weak days because I'm like, I'm trying to find that stinker, or that's that,"
"3984960","3988280"," that company that's outperforming when the market is not performing. "
"3989000","3990300"," Same, same kind of concept."
"3990740","3992060"," Yeah, that makes a lot of sense."
"3993180","3996460"," Uh, you're just basically trying to be max contrarian. "
"3997060","3997500"," Yeah."
"3998060","3999200"," Yeah, max contrarian."
"3999500","4003460"," Yeah, that makes, I mean, that's basically how I live my entire life. "
"4003460","4010420"," So much to the chagrin of others, but, uh, well, I can feel, you know, yesterday I was thinking"
"4010420","4014860"," about your pain yesterday and our conversation and your frustration."
"4015600","4022400"," We've had your that, that your frustration conversation before in phone calls and, uh, it's, it"
"4022400","4030680"," has, it can't be easy for an investor out there that is trying to wade through the hip-deep"
"4030680","4035940"," bullshit to not just survive, but evolve in the next decade."
"4036520","4039800"," And, um, it can be frustrating. "
"4040700","4043500"," There's, I don't think that there's a, um, another way to say it."
"4043520","4051480"," It's like, uh, I don't want to wake up in the five years and have missed, uh, some buying"
"4051480","4051860"," opportunities."
"4051920","4053400"," John Hagerty just talked about it. "
"4053620","4061140"," Uh, he was just commenting in the chat saying, you know, in 2008, uh, it was all, it was so"
"4061140","4064320"," much doom and gloom that, uh, you know, you might have missed out."
"4064440","4066100"," You look back and you go, fuck me, man."
"4066400","4069180"," I didn't buy Apple at a dollar or two dollars or Amazon. "
"4069320","4075980"," This is going back to 2000, but, um, because they're going to zero, you know, pet smart went to"
"4075980","4081240"," zero, but if you'd bought like a basket of those tech stocks, you'd still be filthy fucking rich"
"4081240","4081620"," today."
"4082100","4082580"," Yeah."
"4084020","4084500"," 100%. "
"4084500","4086860"," And it's hard that it's hot."
"4086980","4093320"," It's not easy day in, day out, uh, especially in this part of the process on the market where you"
"4093320","4100080"," can go, I mean, dude, so we've been hearing crash now collapsed now since last fucking May and"
"4100080","4106760"," June, uh, every day, nonstop in the company grows louder and louder and louder."
"4107520","4113080"," I mean, they've been calling for like earnings recessions and GDP to collapse. "
"4113180","4113640"," Yeah."
"4113859","4114040"," Yeah."
"4114319","4116040"," Quarter seven quarters now. "
"4116340","4116840"," Yeah, dude."
"4117120","4122380"," It's just like, uh, for me, at least every once in a while, I'm ready to snap."
"4122540","4124620"," I was like, there was a last month or something. "
"4124620","4126260"," I was like, I just want to walk away from the fucking market."
"4126560","4127660"," There's two, I think those two weeks ago."
"4127819","4130020"," Yeah, I was, I was feeling that way too. "
"4130020","4137540"," And I don't know exactly what it was that happened, but you know, this, this thing that we do as"
"4137540","4146840"," they call it in the Sopranos, uh, it's probably the only thing where you can be 100% right"
"4146840","4150439"," and still not profit from it."
"4150720","4158200"," And that bothers me a lot, like where, you know, the markets sentiment or, you know, things that,"
"4158760","4164560"," something that's like super bullish is like a meh and something that's super bearish is like up"
"4164560","4164960"," $10."
"4165960","4167740"," It's like, I don't know. "
"4167979","4172660"," It's almost like you have to be completely insane to call some of these things."
"4173279","4178520"," Um, yeah, those are the things that I'm kind of like that I get uncomfortable with a lot, but"
"4178520","4180200"," that's just my way I'm built."
"4180660","4184700"," I, I, I just, it's almost like it's built to tire you out. "
"4184920","4186399"," And that, that's what it is."
"4186399","4187240"," It's, it's basic."
"4187460","4187640"," Okay. "
"4187640","4192560"," So I don't know if you know slot machine theory and I don't know why I know this, but basically"
"4192560","4199820"," if you're playing slot machines, your whole goal is to play as long as you can, hoping that you'll"
"4199820","4202660"," get like the big bonus thing that pays you."
"4202880","4209580"," So it's kind of almost the same thing as a stock market where your only goal is just to not"
"4209580","4215540"," go bankrupt and try to hold on until your great thesis plays out."
"4215820","4216760"," That's like my theory. "
"4217080","4221080"," Like you have to be able to sustain some like bar theory."
"4221940","4222460"," Yeah."
"4223440","4223960"," Yeah. "
"4224260","4225880"," I mean, it, it makes a lot of sense."
"4225900","4230900"," Cause like if you just get blown out every time you make a trade, you're not gonna build anything"
"4230900","4239480"," over time or, you know, it's just, I don't, I don't know, you gotta make bet, you gotta manage"
"4239480","4239880"," them."
"4240060","4241700"," Hey, people buy in Tesla 1500. "
"4242420","4245920"," And it's just like, like the noise."
"4246580","4250180"," I was like, and of course I got ostracized."
"4250300","4252620"," I'm on, I think I, I think I said, no, I'm out. "
"4252840","4253980"," It was like 12 or 1300."
"4254100","4257440"," And I think we went up a little bit of a hundred points or something."
"4257580","4263300"," I don't know what we went to, but I got ostracized that people that were like, I fucking hate you. "
"4263580","4265060"," You're not a fucking Tesla bull."
"4265400","4266440"," Go fuck yourself."
"4267420","4268640"," You suck balls. "
"4269420","4278190"," And it's the same thing here in some ways and specific things."
"4278190","4280930"," You know, it's like, it's like, you know, it's like, you know what you're doing?"
"4282630","4283730"," It's going to zero."
"4284430","4286070"," And you should not be buying down here. "
"4286590","4288470"," And yeah, yeah, exactly."
"4288690","4291890"," I mean, you get worn out on both sides of it."
"4291990","4292970"," Cause you never seem to win. "
"4293450","4299830"," Or no, you don't seem to win in the, in the, like the emotional, mental aspect to this or the,"
"4300190","4303870"," I mean, you win in the money side of things, but right."
"4304250","4305810"," Or it just feels like you're on."
"4307090","4308150"," No, I just lost them. "
"4309810","4310890"," So we can get them back on."
"4310990","4312170"," We just lost them real quick, I think."
"4314450","4315650"," We just want lost, Winky. "
"4317650","4324670"," What we're going to do is we're going to switch over to, uh, we're going to switch over to, um,"
"4327430","4331830"," to talking about, we'll try to end this part of the conversation about, uh, trader mentality,"
"4332470","4333270"," trader psyche."
"4334230","4337290"," Uh, yeah, I can, I want you guys out there that are watching this."
"4337370","4345430"," I want you to know that, um, uh, like, you know, you have to be a sociopath and you, you"
"4345430","4347330"," remove emotions from trading and investing. "
"4348550","4354130"," Um, and everything is great when we're in a bull run, right?"
"4354530","4355670"," Uh, everybody's happy."
"4355830","4356610"," It's all going up."
"4356770","4357590"," Everybody's making money. "
"4357630","4358230"," Everything is great."
"4358510","4365410"," But when you're in, um, a recessionary run or a bear market."
"4366410","4373430"," And, you know, for me, it's been, uh, since December of 2020, uh, my trading has been reduced and"
"4373430","4377730"," reduced and reduced and reduced since December of 2020 to where we are today. "
"4378510","4379710"," And it gets tiring."
"4380090","4380930"," Uh, it does."
"4381090","4382110"," It just gets tiring. "
"4382730","4385770"," Uh, so you have to have the will to per se, uh, persevere."
"4386530","4391910"," Uh, but to say even though that you have to remove all emotions and, um, you know, be a psychopath"
"4391910","4398190"," or a sociopath, excuse me, I was thinking about a sociopath, um, you know, to say that it's not,"
"4398190","4399990"," you know, sometimes it's not fun anymore."
"4400950","4408070"," Uh, and sometimes the cacophony on both ends on the highs and then on the lows, it just becomes,"
"4408070","4409690"," uh, it's a little overwhelmed. "
"4409970","4410690"," That's an overwhelming."
"4411010","4412410"," It's just tiring, right?"
"4413650","4418070"," Um, obviously you can get a generated new link copy."
"4418070","4418990"," I'm gonna send a new one. "
"4420270","4426690"," Uh, you'll always hear like, you'll always hear people out there that'll say things like, uh, oh,"
"4426770","4428530"," I'm the most Sigma guy out there."
"4428530","4430450"," And I'm like, I don't know if I believe that motherfucker."
"4430610","4432650"," So it shouldn't have said that was gonna kind of rough. "
"4434050","4436690"," I think that guy's got a thousand bucks."
"4437350","4437950"," I do."
"4438050","4439390"," I'm like, I don't believe that guy. "
"4440250","4449070"," Cause the people that I do trade with or invest with, uh, they, they have the, the same, they have"
"4449070","4452430"," the same, I'm not the only one that's saying this, uh, as my point."
"4453090","4460850"," But at the same time, while, while I'm, while we are dealing with this, uh, I don't want to, I"
"4460850","4464610"," sent you a new link, Winky, uh, so you can join us again."
"4468760","4473440"," Uh, you know, you don't want to lose, uh, side of the prize at the end of the rainbow either,"
"4473440","4473780"," right?"
"4475060","4481520"," Uh, so when it does turn up, you know, people start to join you in their happiness, but they're"
"4481520","4483180"," normally like mid or top buyers. "
"4484460","4486860"," Um, they're not the bottom buyers."
"4487340","4491560"," Some are, you'll meet a few that are like, Hey, I was there with you since the beginning and you'll"
"4491560","4496660"," remember those people, but, uh, the group grows larger and larger and they're normally top buyers,"
"4496660","4496920"," right?"
"4497080","4499580"," And then eventually there's a, uh, dammit."
"4501740","4505880"," I sent a new link trading up to 411 64 right now. "
"4508300","4509480"," I'm going to take some off here."
"4509720","4510360"," Hold on a second here."
"4523250","4524810"," Uh, some, I'm out right now. "
"4524810","4525290"," I'm flat again."
"4525790","4531250"," So, uh, I just sent Winky a new link."
"4531630","4535050"," I ended up losing him on stream there for a minute, but you know, it's not easy. "
"4535350","4542430"," I mean, when you're at a top, right, and you're trying to sell, uh, when everyone is buying, it's,"
"4542490","4544110"," it's difficult on the psyche."
"4544910","4550810"," When you're at a bottom and you're trying to buy, it's really difficult on the psyche is my point."
"4551070","4552190"," The middle area is great. "
"4553310","4559090"," Um, but like when you're in cyclically, when you're down here and you're up there, it's, it's not a"
"4559090","4559390"," nightmare."
"4574560","4577480"," Uh, oh, stream lab said I left, I left the meeting."
"4577940","4578720"," I did. "
"4578860","4582800"," I, so I was in the meeting Winky, right?"
"4583100","4589300"," And then you got cut off or like, um, I don't know, like the, the, the bars went away."
"4589920","4592500"," So then I went in and generated a new link."
"4593600","4595840"," Uh, so that would cut off that. "
"4595980","4597780"," Then I would have signaled that I'm cutting you off."
"4597780","4599560"," And then none of that makes sense."
"4599760","4600720"," So there's like a link generated. "
"4601700","4603100"," And then I lost you."
"4603880","4608660"," Uh, so then I like, uh, ended the call and then started a new call."
"4609300","4610480"," I apologize, brother. "
"4611920","4612900"," We're not done, Winky."
"4613320","4616880"," We, I need, we have, I'm going to, I'm going to wrap this up so that you, I want people"
"4616880","4618440"," to ask you some questions in the chat."
"4619540","4622960"," Look at that red bar. "
"4623100","4625300"," I'm like, I'm closing red bar."
"4628980","4630160"," Big old red bar."
"4632880","4633960"," So I sent you a new link. "
"4634140","4635880"," So join us in the chat one more time, man."
"4636880","4639500"," Uh, so we can get the chat to ask you questions."
"4640080","4644140"," I think a lot of people want to ask you things for you to expound upon. "
"4644740","4646200"," So listen to me every day."
"4646260","4648980"," I'm like, every graduate day, regurgitate, regurgitate."
"4649480","4651180"," We have new viewers every day. "
"4651200","4653140"," And I'm like, always doing that for people."
"4653300","4656400"," I like, I'll like, I'll set up a story over a month."
"4656920","4661740"," And then I'm going to rant for like an hour about tying it all back together again. "
"4664540","4667240"," So I need you to bring some freshness to the stream."
"4677070","4679610"," Yeah, hold on guys before you, before you ask the questions."
"4684290","4686750"," Uh, yeah, I don't know why streamlabs are sucking so hard. "
"4686850","4688090"," I just sent you a new link, Winky."
"4688090","4690410"," I just sent you a new one, man."
"4690590","4690970"," Hold on, man. "
"4691050","4692010"," I'll send you another one right now."
"4695660","4699040"," Just go back to your Gmail and click through the link that I send you right now."
"4710950","4711690"," Try that one. "
"4712910","4715930"," I want to know if you can't join a second time again, too."
"4716150","4720810"," Even if, tell me right now, if you can't join that link, that new link I just sent you, because"
"4720810","4724110"," I want to see if I have to like turn streamlabs off a second time."
"4724110","4727610"," Like, try not interview somebody twice if we lose the connection. "
"4732400","4733980"," Yeah, I'm probably going to have to."
"4734280","4741200"," There's a way for me to do, um, a collaborative camera outside of streamlabs, but it's complicated."
"4742960","4746040"," Uh, it is more, well, there's two things. "
"4746320","4749280"," It is more, um, guaranteed to work."
"4751660","4753240"," Technically, it's more guaranteed to work."
"4753400","4758180"," It's a lot more work, but, uh, the last thing I want to try is when this Google, this Google"
"4758180","4759980"," fiber is supposed to come online on Monday. "
"4760340","4764040"," So I'm going to see if Google, I think the issue part of the issue here is the upload speeds,"
"4764480","4767660"," Comcast sucks with upload speeds."
"4768780","4777220"," Even when they promise to you commercial, uh, fucking internet that I paid double for $365 or some"
"4777220","4777800"," stupid a month."
"4779440","4786200"," Now, uh, see if you can, um, I don't want to, I don't want to show my, uh, I don't"
"4786200","4789940"," want to show my Google on, um, just try to click through. "
"4790780","4791760"," Just one more time."
"4792800","4794420"," Just try one more time to click through."
"4801040","4802640"," You did click through and you're not in. "
"4802840","4811180"," So this is a total, this is a total fuck show with, um, hold on here."
"4817950","4819430"," I don't know if this is me off now."
"4821270","4826750"," So this is definitely like a, um, an issue with streamlabs. "
"4826890","4828170"," Yeah, man, let me see if I can do a Google meet."
"4828290","4828510"," Hold on."
"4829210","4830210"," I can do a Google meet. "
"4830310","4830770"," Hold on a second."
"4833550","4836790"," Uh, I pay for it."
"4838010","4840550"," I pay for Google meet every month. "
"4840770","4845890"," So, uh, let me see if I can do a Google, Google meet."
"4847190","4847390"," Think tight."
"4856840","4859340"," New meeting, start instant meeting. "
"4872690","4873730"," Think tight brother."
"4877530","4883810"," Uh, if they invite you, I think here, show everyone I got to do an invitation."
"4886490","4887610"," Present now. "
"4888770","4889970"," Raise hand more options."
"4894500","4895460"," Yes, second here."
"4900340","4901220"," Add people. "
"4903860","4906140"," Maybe we can get Joe on the call here."
"4907340","4910240"," Maybe we'll, maybe we'll get Joe in here too."
"4912880","4914140"," We'll send him an invitation. "
"4920050","4924410"," Uh, let me know if you, I just sent an invitation to Joe Harper and Winky."
"4931490","4933870"," Let's see if we, let's see if we can get these guys on here again."
"4941030","4942270"," Say something really quick. "
"4942550","4947900"," Um, Wink."
"4953680","4954540"," Can you hear me, Winky?"
"4961390","4962450"," I can't hear you."
"4963790","4967520"," I should be able to hear you and I can't. "
"4989660","4999410"," Let's console chat with everyone like I can see the, I can see your audio in the background,"
"5000310","5001530"," but I'm not picking up."
"5002030","5005710"," Uh, let me see here."
"5010410","5011210"," Hold on here. "
"5011670","5013030"," Wink, you say something again."
"5015490","5017550"," Be like, check one two, check one two."
"5018990","5024450"," I have the desktop audio off, so maybe it'll come back on here in just a second. "
"5037040","5037820"," Gym board."
"5038880","5039740"," Request access."
"5040500","5041360"," Access denied. "
"5043300","5045240"," You'll get an email saying it was requested."
"5046580","5047280"," It's all on here."
"5049240","5050200"," Never ends. "
"5054180","5055200"," Can you hear me, Winky?"
"5055200","5055280"," Okay."
"5060370","5066470"," My first center, uh, primary, the go to spam."
"5066970","5067530"," Can you hear me?"
"5068050","5069790"," I think I can hear you. "
"5069850","5070120"," Hold on."
"5071690","5072810"," I don't know."
"5073030","5073790"," I can hear you, I think. "
"5073990","5074510"," I can hear you, brother."
"5075750","5076970"," Why is it still hard?"
"5078170","5078970"," I got you, man."
"5079070","5079810"," We can hear you on stream. "
"5080010","5083270"," He is everywhere can do this stuff and I'm just like, oh."
"5084590","5085650"," Can you hear me, Winky?"
"5086230","5087070"," We can hear you."
"5087190","5087690"," I want you to know. "
"5087730","5088630"," Don't say anything crazy."
"5089770","5091830"," Can anybody out there, I can hear Winky."
"5092130","5093930"," Can anyone on stream hear Winky right now?"
"5095050","5096390"," Why is this a good thing?"
"5099130","5101030"," Can you guys hear Winky talking on stream?"
"5107840","5108560"," Oh, yeah. "
"5108720","5108840"," Okay."
"5108940","5109380"," You can hear him."
"5109460","5109780"," Good, good, good. "
"5112860","5114680"," Maybe I'll text him right now until I can hear."
"5114780","5115940"," I'll just tell him what we can hear you."
"5122430","5123170"," Oh, okay. "
"5123390","5123430"," Cool."
"5124250","5125370"," I can't hear you."
"5125590","5126970"," That's why I was confused. "
"5127590","5130250"," Uh, so Winky, Winky, so Winky can't hear us."
"5130490","5132590"," I'll just listen to your audio through Twitch."
"5133730","5135030"," So a four second delay. "
"5135830","5137390"," There'll be a short delay."
"5140610","5142270"," So we can hear you, Winky."
"5142650","5143390"," What we'll do is this. "
"5143650","5144810"," There's a four second delay."
"5145210","5147930"," So you're going to hear like a pause between questions and answers."
"5150670","5151990"," Say something again, Winky. "
"5158550","5159690"," I might have lost him."
"5160210","5160630"," Hello."
"5162130","5162610"," Awesome. "
"5162730","5163850"," So here's what we're going to do, Winky."
"5164450","5167470"," I am going to be quiet here."
"5168130","5170230"," I'll work on the chart above us. "
"5170670","5174770"," I want to let you guys know out there that we have more supplies showing itself above."
"5175410","5177510"," So can we go higher is the question."
"5178690","5180850"," I want you to watch my cursor here over here real quick. "
"5181390","5182790"," So I want you to see this above."
"5183190","5185790"," This is supply even higher."
"5186770","5187950"," Okay, I'll wait to see that up here. "
"5188110","5189770"," There's more supply presenting itself."
"5190590","5195150"," This is like a downward dog for an upward dog trying to get on top of the downward dog, right?"
"5195950","5198210"," And so we've got this H line right here."
"5199090","5201970"," Now, but there are some targets even above the H line. "
"5202490","5206250"," So we're going to look really quick on book map."
"5206450","5207850"," And we're already said that was a general area."
"5210950","5212490"," So I want you to see it right here. "
"5212630","5213870"," There's this area right here."
"5214410","5217710"," There's another one, another target above right here."
"5218770","5221530"," And there's another target even higher. "
"5223090","5226010"," So let me put that one to put one of those right there."
"5226910","5228830"," So there's some targets up here."
"5229070","5230190"," Okay, I want you to see that right here. "
"5230390","5231510"," Is this target right here?"
"5232410","5232750"," Okay."
"5233350","5235670"," And that's way up there at 413 86."
"5236950","5240610"," Now, I'm going to show you two more things before we get back to Winky talking. "
"5241890","5246490"," And that's due to that supply that's showing itself, showing itself above, right?"
"5246970","5251070"," The last thing that we're looking for is, hey, is this a bull trap or not?"
"5251650","5256150"," And so we're going to look at the VIX really quick and just see if the VIX is lying to"
"5256150","5256750"," us or not."
"5257750","5261710"," So we're going to take a look at the VIX and then say, take a positive two."
"5261970","5263570"," Can we go higher?"
"5264690","5266190"," Can we go higher here?"
"5266470","5268110"," Or are we at some kind of a support?"
"5268790","5274150"," So just on the VIX really quick, we are kind of free floating here, right?"
"5274510","5277430"," We have more room for the VIX to go down. "
"5277830","5278410"," See that?"
"5278570","5279890"," We're not going to reach out."
"5280050","5281670"," We have more room to go down and VIX."
"5282050","5283870"," We can actually go even farther and farther. "
"5284070","5287610"," It's not like the VIX is already right here."
"5287910","5294370"," So even if we go up here and come back down, we haven't seen the VIX bottom like bounce, bounce,"
"5294690","5295730"," bounce for a move up."
"5295730","5296770"," We haven't seen that yet. "
"5297190","5299630"," VIX is kind of in a free fall right now."
"5300130","5302930"," So is there more room for the VIX to drop as the question?"
"5303310","5304690"," You bet your ass there is."
"5305750","5307650"," So can we go higher here?"
"5308390","5309970"," It looks like we can, man. "
"5310110","5310990"," We can go higher."
"5311270","5314190"," So I'm going to turn this over to Winky here in just a moment."
"5314310","5316550"," I want you guys to..."
"5316550","5318170"," The dream is sponsored by To the Tick. "
"5318890","5320190"," Get free daily Pive winner, right?"
"5320410","5321290"," Only write one more thing up here."
"5322310","5325010"," By signing up at ToTheTick.com."
"5325010","5326370"," H-line, baby."
"5326750","5328010"," Another H-line right there. "
"5328350","5329610"," And here's your next H-line."
"5329930","5334070"," Inside the chat, I want you to begin again asking questions."
"5335010","5336970"," And now I'm going to warn you of something. "
"5337270","5337570"," Two things."
"5338750","5342450"," Winky, if you don't want to answer something, you just ignore it, okay?"
"5343110","5345030"," Some people will try to put you on the spot."
"5345910","5350210"," If you don't feel confident answering something, you don't have to say it's them like, I don't feel"
"5350210","5350490"," confident. "
"5350750","5352750"," Just answer the questions that you're like, I want to answer."
"5352750","5355670"," Just like, start answering a question, then move on to the next one."
"5356410","5362330"," If it's a question that you need to prepare for, either don't answer it or come back to answer it"
"5363110","5365450"," down the road or in Discord or something like that. "
"5365650","5369070"," So I don't want to ever put you on the spot or anything like there."
"5369150","5374470"," Anybody that I interview, and that doesn't mean they're not smart or anything, or that they're"
"5374470","5377090"," like, ha-zah, anything like that."
"5377430","5379370"," You want to have people prepared to answer questions. "
"5379930","5382870"," But do ask questions inside of the chat if you'd like."
"5383350","5388730"," And I'm going to shut up now, and I'm going to do Winky as I'm going to do access denied."
"5389630","5394590"," I'm going to go to the chat, dude, and I want you to read, you can read through them as"
"5394590","5394790"," well. "
"5395010","5396450"," I'm going to read a couple off to you."
"5398810","5400390"," Let me see what some of these questions were."
"5400490","5403990"," I saw some questions of, John Hagerty said, Hey, Wink, do you trade futures?"
"5404490","5407010"," Minis, micros, if so, which and how?"
"5481290","5482950"," I'm not getting an answer from Winky right now. "
"5483050","5483590"," I'm not hearing them."
"5504180","5505900"," Doesn't even get an answer from Winky right now."
"5508120","5509100"," No, he's not muted. "
"5509820","5510800"," Everything's good on my end."
"5510940","5512100"," I think it might be Comcast."
"5513460","5515220"," Xfinity really fucking sucks balls. "
"5515420","5515820"," I got to be honest."
"5517800","5518840"," Yeah, he's not muted."
"5521880","5526980"," So what you know we'll do is we'll we'll do is we'll maybe just continue this interview a third,"
"5526980","5528760"," maybe just a third meeting on Monday or something. "
"5529700","5531900"," And we get we end up getting."
"5532360","5535520"," Let's look on the 15 minute real quick and see if Winky comes back."
"5537400","5541180"," Yeah, there's a 15 minute bull fly, our bull plane right here. "
"5541520","5542200"," Be back, Winky."
"5543420","5544480"," Sorry about that, guys."
"5544760","5545120"," I don't know. "
"5547180","5548020"," So he's back."
"5550200","5551300"," Winky, big question."
"5551700","5552600"," Do you trade futures?"
"5553680","5555400"," Yeah, we're still there. "
"5556080","5556840"," Yeah, we're still here."
"5556960","5557440"," We can hear you."
"5565070","5565910"," Okay, cool. "
"5566210","5567950"," Yeah, I did trade future."
"5568210","5572330"," I'll give you the short version because I just went through the entire long version before I knew I"
"5572330","5572850"," was disconnected."
"5580970","5585750"," Okay, so I started trading options in 2020 when everything blew up. "
"5586590","5591550"," Then I learned about the tax advantages and the different rules regarding futures."
"5591850","5593550"," And I tried that out."
"5593550","5598150"," My experience with futures was I entered a trade and in queue. "
"5599050","5603110"," And an hour after I entered that trade, I was down $30,000."
"5604070","5607650"," And then an hour after that, I was up $60K."
"5608610","5612470"," So I sold it, took the money, closed the account, never went back. "
"5613390","5614830"," Can you have a story about that?"
"5615070","5618210"," Is the goat Brian Watts?"
"5620390","5630320"," That was my future's experience."
"5631660","5636020"," So what is your, like how do you trade today or complete thing?"
"5636240","5640680"," Like do you have stuff in mutual funds, savings accounts, do you buy stock, do you trade options"
"5640680","5642660"," stocks, ETFs, what do you do?"
"5651890","5658370"," Like Frank the Bear or Binky was saying the other day, I sort of have different buckets for"
"5658370","5659270"," different purposes."
"5660090","5666510"," Like I have a savings account that has quite a lot of money in it. "
"5666670","5676510"," Then I have an IRA and then the IRA, I typically gravitate towards index funds, ETFs, you know,"
"5677010","5680910"," like things like safer bets like that."
"5681210","5686790"," And then in my trading account, that's where most of my stock positions live."
"5686790","5690590"," And also I trade options out of my stock account. "
"5690990","5698090"," Sometimes I actually flip a new account, just for single trade, because I don't want to stare at it"
"5698090","5699150"," while I'm..."
"5702120","5707240"," Hey, Winky, what I'm going to do is I'm going to call you, and I'm going to put the, someone"
"5707240","5708720"," in the, who said this?"
"5709000","5709740"," Stock positions."
"5710420","5713520"," And I just don't want to look at it necessarily while I'm..."
"5714620","5717740"," I'm going to put you on, so if you can hear me, I'm going to put you on a phone"
"5717740","5718320"," call instead."
"5718320","5722960"," We're just going to bypass all this bullshit, so we can be more fluid. "
"5750830","5755870"," Hey, I've got you on live right now with my phone, and it's just easier, dude."
"5756630","5758190"," Yeah, I don't know what..."
"5758190","5760910"," I think streamlabs might just disconnect me after 30 minutes."
"5761130","5762250"," I don't really know. "
"5764130","5766930"," Say something again, I want to just check my sound mixer."
"5768590","5769070"," Hello."
"5769910","5771190"," Sweet, so they can hear you now. "
"5771190","5772410"," So cool."
"5773630","5776610"," So yeah, you're on board with the different accounts for different things."
"5776610","5778030"," You don't trade futures anymore. "
"5779830","5786410"," Brian Watts, dude, had that same experience that he recounted once, and it's a hilarious story"
"5787670","5793150"," about the panic that sets in when you see your account just trade wildly like that."
"5793830","5796770"," Yeah, and it was like such a short round."
"5797050","5798950"," It was 120 minutes. "
"5801190","5805890"," And I'm just like, okay, that's a lot of volatility in that amount of time."
"5806370","5814890"," He sat on like a six-figure loss over a weekend or something, and his whole life had passed before"
"5814890","5816350"," his eyes like losing everything."
"5816790","5823550"," They ended up making the money back, but at that time period, not knowing if you're going to get a"
"5823550","5826990"," margin call, not knowing if it's never coming back. "
"5827550","5828670"," I think it was short too."
"5829290","5835070"," So yeah, we're just going to keep going up and I just get smoked left behind."
"5836750","5837710"," Yeah, exactly. "
"5837910","5845010"," I mean, that can happen really in any instrument, but it just seems like it's sort of like more"
"5845010","5850290"," unlimited in the future is like, I don't know how to explain what I'm saying."
"5850650","5856010"," Like, options, you put 100 bucks in a contract, that 100 bucks is like where it can go, right?"
"5856450","5856730"," Limited risk."
"5857370","5859090"," Yeah, limited risk, it just seems. "
"5859290","5864370"," I mean, you can limit your risk in futures too, but like, had I put a stop on that incubate,"
"5864970","5870450"," it would have went down like, I don't know, I think it was like 500 points in an hour and"
"5870450","5873990"," then I would have sold out of it after like 25 points."
"5874310","5878350"," I would have lost money and I never would have got the double upside."
"5879250","5886330"," So I don't, it was just, I don't know how to necessarily do that work without losing money. "
"5886330","5887650"," So that's why I stopped doing it."
"5888730","5890950"," I'm going to interject for just a minute here."
"5891030","5892010"," I want to let people know. "
"5892370","5895990"," So I want you guys to be aware of something here."
"5896930","5903110"," So if you're at home right now, at 1045, look at my cursor where it is right now, we had"
"5903110","5910550"," a new high at 1045 a.m. In the next 15 minutes heading into the half an hour."
"5913270","5920490"," Excuse me, sorry, 1045 at a new, we had a new high on the half an hour, which is 11"
"5920490","5926230"," a.m. So the stock market hours, if you don't know this, are on the half an hour. "
"5927010","5933030"," So stock market hours are 930 to 1030, 1030 to 1130, 1130 to 1230, up until 430 in the afternoon."
"5934410","5937430"," So we count an hour as 1030, 1130, right?"
"5937970","5942710"," So we're heading into a 15 minute right now, right?"
"5943370","5945990"," So at 1045, we got a new high."
"5946310","5952210"," So at 11 a.m., or excuse me, 1115, I'm looking for a new high here. "
"5953070","5958530"," So if we don't get a new high, right, right up here every 15 minutes, we don't get a new"
"5958530","5958770"," high."
"5960330","5966230"," Or if you fail to make a new high like we did right here, there's a higher chance of the"
"5966230","5968250"," market rolling over to check."
"5969050","5972410"," The first check would be the five minutes, okay?"
"5972890","5975510"," So it's 11.05 right now by 1115. "
"5975730","5977090"," I'm looking for this new high."
"5977270","5984750"," If we don't get a new high at 1115, I'm going to expect a roll over to check this R3"
"5984750","5985170"," area."
"5985350","5988410"," It doesn't mean we don't trade sideways, then get up here and do this stuff. "
"5989230","5992130"," But it's starting to get a little long in the tooth up here."
"5992130","5993650"," So just be conscious of that."
"5994210","5996470"," You see the trade sideways here. "
"5996950","6003750"," You're going to be wanting to see by 1115, a new high at 1130, a tag of 411.96. If"
"6003750","6005270"," we don't get that, we will roll over."
"6006070","6011170"," So you might want to take some money off the table, leave some runners on that kind of stuff, start"
"6011170","6011910"," to manage a trade."
"6012590","6016510"," Maybe you take the money off the table and re-enter a cheaper call option, right?"
"6017350","6021230"," So you like, let's say you bought a call option at 50 cents or a dollar and you take the"
"6021230","6026310"," money at two or three bucks, you roll your trade down to a 50 cent in a dollar contract and"
"6026310","6027490"," pocket that money at this point. "
"6028330","6030030"," Okay, all right, sorry, we can go ahead."
"6030810","6031710"," That sounds good."
"6031970","6032930"," Sounds like it was strategy. "
"6034810","6036730"," So next thing, we've got some questions here."
"6037290","6038190"," Let's see if people are asking."
"6040010","6042070"," Do you see any questions yourself that you want to answer?"
"6042910","6045210"," I answered Hagerty's question, unfortunately. "
"6046670","6051510"," Let me just go ahead and ask me questions, guys."
"6051670","6052990"," I'm in both chats right now."
"6053190","6056790"," I'm monitoring, so just ask and I'll try and answer. "
"6058090","6062910"," John did make a comment about the size, right?"
"6063350","6065270"," In futures, you can do micros."
"6065390","6069890"," I mean, the micro is the fees right now, ridiculous, but you can do micros."
"6069950","6072470"," You don't have to do full size contracts as well. "
"6072470","6077290"," You can do the mini rather than just going like, can't buy an ES or sell an ES."
"6077610","6085610"," Yeah, yeah, I know, but so like the land that I've learned is I tend to learn through doing and"
"6085610","6086990"," under extreme pressure."
"6088770","6090870"," I don't know why that's the case. "
"6091030","6097150"," I don't know why I can only learn if I'm like in trouble, but that's how my brain learns."
"6097710","6103370"," So I just jump in like it when I want to monitor a stock."
"6103650","6104710"," I don't put it on a watch list. "
"6104870","6112550"," I buy a share of it because then I have risk on it and it's, you know, I don't really"
"6112550","6119990"," care, but it is for whatever reason in my brain, having risk assigned to something makes it more"
"6119990","6121110"," important to me."
"6121730","6124870"," So that's just how I do things."
"6124870","6132270"," So I have like one share of like 80 companies that I just, it's basically a watch list, but I"
"6132270","6133850"," have like exposure. "
"6134510","6135570"," It's kind of weird."
"6135810","6136670"," I'm a weird guy."
"6136790","6137890"," I tell everybody I need that. "
"6138130","6139630"," So this is the way it is."
"6140050","6142230"," Do you, um, someone asked about hedging."
"6142510","6148990"," Do you, are you the like, so you know how like, if you're on the five minute EMA 27 or"
"6148990","6149890"," the hour, it doesn't matter. "
"6149890","6154110"," I'm like 27 on a five, 15 hour day."
"6154690","6159790"," If we're trading above it, are you long the stock and then do you short?"
"6160550","6160970"," Right."
"6161290","6164050"," Let me explain how I do. "
"6164050","6166250"," If you're on the underlying, do you sell calls and puts?"
"6167410","6170770"," Do you take on puts to hedge your long position in the market?"
"6170990","6172410"," What are your, what do you do?"
"6173250","6173810"," Yeah."
"6174110","6180690"," So basically on anything that I have equity in, um, I kind of, okay."
"6180870","6186610"," So like a lot of people probably think the only thing I own is like, Berkshire class B shares, um,"
"6187090","6191650"," but I have a portfolio, not including the one share portfolio that I have. "
"6191830","6195010"," I have a portfolio of about 25 different stocks, right?"
"6195170","6196850"," There's all kinds of different shit in there."
"6196990","6203290"," There's Para, Uber, you know, things like that, that are kind of like stinky and I've kind of just"
"6203290","6206230"," been like, watching out of the corner of my eye for the last couple of years."
"6206230","6212630"," And then I have stuff that I really, really like like Regeneron, Lily, Nike, Blackstone, Morgan"
"6212630","6215050"," Stanley, Disney, all that stuff. "
"6215250","6221370"," So like the way that I approach hedging is it really depends on what the position is, right?"
"6221870","6226990"," Like when we were heading into Uber's earnings and it had a list, I was like, holy shit, like this"
"6226990","6228550"," is the chance that I have the hedge."
"6228770","6233110"," And of course it went up a little bit, but now it's kind of like retreating back to it's, uh,"
"6233770","6235550"," where it belongs, I guess I would say."
"6236710","6243330"," Uber will one day be $70, but analysts have been calling for that for the last four years. "
"6244230","6250970"," So like if you, if you look at that, like, okay, Uber $70 at some point, but every single year"
"6250970","6253390"," they come back and re-up their target."
"6253710","6260510"," So like that when I hedge a lot, Para obviously is a pretty sloppy stock a lot of times."
"6260610","6261650"," I usually hedge that. "
"6261650","6270270"," I don't spend too much time hedging things like Domino's Pizza, you know, different stocks, you"
"6270270","6275610"," know, I'm sure you guys noticed this too, like when you go to try to contract and like the minimum"
"6275610","6282010"," increments like five cents or you look at the pricing on options on just certain stocks that people"
"6282010","6287210"," don't tend to like flip in and out of like Domino's and things like this, the option pricing is"
"6287210","6296110"," just extremely high and they don't really move them so it really depends on what what I'm looking"
"6296110","6299910"," at and why I'm thinking that it might be a good time to hedge."
"6300950","6306810"," No, it's basically we're going to, you and I are going to talk about one of the tools we're trying"
"6306810","6316890"," to release is a way to chart options further"
"6316890","6317790"," out in time."
"6319550","6326430"," I try to, when I day train, I try to watch the options chain for the today for the next"
"6326430","6333710"," week, but like volatility was he goes through the options chain and builds spreads way farther out"
"6333710","6341630"," in time and he's always looking for spreads that'll actually like or like a spread that within the"
"6341630","6347950"," price spread, he can actually get paid like open a spread for near zero dollars, call broker and be"
"6347950","6351670"," like, hey, yeah, I see the spread is this and then he's actually, sometimes he's actually made"
"6351670","6356430"," money, he's actually been owed money opening up a trade. "
"6356790","6357810"," Do you do any of that?"
"6358010","6365110"," Do you look for like, hey, this option that's three months away, it's at the bottom of its curve"
"6365110","6365490"," or?"
"6367590","6373230"," So what I like to do like in that regard is I like to have like, okay, and a lot"
"6373230","6378430"," of people think I'm like a witch doctor because I talk about seasonality and I, I really like the"
"6378430","6379710"," words that Larry Williams does."
"6380030","6381930"," Like people can rasp me about and give a shit."
"6382110","6388030"," I've made so much money just following Larry Williams over the years that like they can say"
"6388030","6391610"," anything they want about him or me and I'll just be like, okay, whatever. "
"6393070","6399390"," But yeah, so I like the look for setups that kind of hit multiple scratch multiple inches at once,"
"6399670","6399770"," right?"
"6399930","6406110"," It might be okay, they have earnings in two weeks or and on top of that, I like the company"
"6406110","6414950"," or, you know, they have like a biotech SBA approval, like a catalyst kind of, you know, I look for"
"6414950","6416070"," catalysts a lot."
"6416310","6417210"," Like I love catalysts."
"6417810","6420810"," What's going to move this stock is their volume in it. "
"6421110","6422330"," Does anybody give a shit?"
"6422530","6423750"," You look at the options chain."
"6423970","6427590"," You see, if you see all zeros of the option chain, don't suck with it."
"6428170","6434150"," Like if you see, like there's some options change you'll look at and there's like the whole thing"
"6434150","6437610"," is empty and you're just like, okay, this probably isn't going to go my way. "
"6437830","6443450"," If I play with this, like, you just kind of have to, uh, you got to seek out energy, you"
"6443450","6446870"," know, like energy in the instrument that you're trying to trade."
"6446990","6454270"," There has to be, it has to either be moving in one way or another towards a catalyst date or"
"6454270","6455830"," nobody else cares."
"6456310","6458230"," You have, that's the, that's really the point. "
"6458490","6462330"," You have to be in things that people, like you have to play the game."
"6462750","6465790"," Like if you're playing poker, you have to sit down on the table and there's other people."
"6466310","6469490"," Well, yeah, I remember we were talking about VIX last week. "
"6469490","6477110"," When we were at, remember at 4.17 and I brought up the options chain of someone buying 26 VIX"
"6477110","6478730"," in June or something, right?"
"6478930","6479150"," Right."
"6480230","6483310"," And they put out, what, 13 million or something or 5 million?"
"6483450","6487850"," I can't remember what it was, but that was digging through the options chain when, of course, the"
"6487850","6492490"," VIX is crashing and someone's out there going, no, no, no, no, no."
"6492830","6494770"," I'm glad it's in June, these third two. "
"6494850","6495110"," Right."
"6495450","6495690"," Yeah."
"6495930","6498570"," But see, that's, that's actually an interesting question that I asked for you. "
"6498950","6505470"," So like when I was first starting getting into like trading communities and I'm, I'm an old"
"6505470","6506550"," internet engineer."
"6506550","6512290"," So like, I am acutely aware of how much 80% of all this shit is a giant scam."
"6512770","6517930"," But when I started kind of getting into trading discords and you'd ask about the VIX, they'd be"
"6517930","6519690"," like, we don't look at the VIX. "
"6519950","6521490"," The VIX doesn't matter."
"6521790","6523270"," You don't trade the VIX."
"6523490","6524510"," That's not what it's there for. "
"6524630","6527050"," That was like strings of discord, not to mention names."
"6527130","6529270"," He wasn't even in the discord at that point."
"6529750","6535150"," But like, they just like roasted me anytime I'd say anything about the VIX. "
"6535450","6541290"," So like, it surprises me to see you like, oh yeah, but you don't actually trade VIX, right?"
"6541470","6544070"," That ticker you, you do it in a different way, right?"
"6544370","6547530"," What are some of the approved ways that you use to trade the VIX?"
"6547530","6549170"," Well, you know, it's weird."
"6549390","6557770"," Like, I was reading Volatility Wizz's newsletter this week and he was like, this is how you express"
"6557770","6558850"," this trade elsewhere."
"6559550","6562130"," It was like, it was great how he worded it. "
"6562730","6564870"," And even when..."
"6564870","6566050"," I'll have to go back and look at that."
"6566310","6569170"," I'll send you a link to it and so you can read it."
"6569370","6573710"," But it was great because I don't..."
"6573710","6578370"," I've tried trading the VIX and I've got, well, on shorter timeframes, I've tried to trade the VIX"
"6578370","6587430"," and I've gotten burned so many times and I think his point to his audience was use Volatility to"
"6587430","6596050"," express Volatility in the trades you're trying to take or in planning your trades. "
"6597990","6600730"," Right, yeah, that's a good point."
"6601390","6607130"," So I'll say a lot of times in chat that I only swing options and stocks that I own to"
"6607130","6609710"," make additional income or to protect myself."
"6610190","6614650"," That's true, like, basically 95% of the time. "
"6615030","6620470"," Sometimes, like, if something price dislocation happens and I feel like, you know, okay, this is"
"6620470","6621970"," dumb, why is this doing this?"
"6622490","6623490"," I'll just go for it."
"6623730","6630610"," But 97% of the time, like, I swing options and things I've either been watching for like five to"
"6630610","6636810"," ten years or things that I own and I stare at the price ticking every single day."
"6637050","6639850"," Like, I just watch it, how it moves, what it does. "
"6640530","6648010"," If it has a bad news release, I know that that usually works like 1.07% of the stock"
"6648010","6652750"," price and if it goes below that, then I know I should buy some, you know, like, all those kinds"
"6652750","6653130"," of things."
"6653470","6658830"," Like, one of my best trades recently, and this is going to sound stupid to so many people, was I"
"6658830","6666230"," was just on a website and I saw an ad that GAP was selling $50 gift cards for 30 bucks."
"6666870","6670130"," At this point, that stock was at $15 a share. "
"6670650","6673070"," I shorted the living hell out of it."
"6673310","6675810"," They reported their earnings and it dropped to 8 bucks."
"6676250","6677870"," It can be that simple, honestly. "
"6678370","6686270"," Like, if you see a retailer just, like, blowing out their entire stock, like, you know, you can use"
"6686270","6690530"," real world clues to, like, make trades."
"6690910","6693570"," Yeah, like, like, the cheque trade?"
"6693910","6696770"," I was like, how did I not see that coming?"
"6698350","6702370"," Like, like, no greater, no greater."
"6702590","6704530"," But there's just so many tickers, you know what I mean?"
"6704710","6709450"," Like, there's so much stuff going on and then you'll have those people who just pop in and I don't"
"6709450","6714970"," have anything against the people who want to trade the low flow small market cap stocks or"
"6714970","6715170"," anything. "
"6715970","6719190"," It's just really dangerous and I've never had it go my way."
"6719370","6720270"," I'm not a single time."
"6720450","6723170"," I'm just talking mostly about the chat GPT thing. "
"6723290","6729050"," We know the entire conversation, or not the entire, but a major part of the conversation is from"
"6729050","6737510"," educational institutions saying they're resistance to chat GPT."
"6738350","6742250"," And of course you're going, it's going to impact online tutoring."
"6743310","6751110"," If you have students that are just going to use the cheap version of an online tutor, I at all"
"6751110","6752530"," chat GPT. "
"6753670","6755370"," It doesn't vote well."
"6755370","6759150"," But why can't she do that?"
"6759670","6766830"," The thing that I kind of like, the thing that kind of worries me a little bit about GPT and"
"6766830","6771030"," everything is like, it does a couple of things really well."
"6771490","6775710"," And they're releasing new models and they're adding new capabilities to it and stuff. "
"6775970","6780930"," But like, right now it can't, you know, like, people are like, oh, it like wrote code."
"6781210","6783650"," It wrote all of Call of Duty in 12 minutes."
"6784350","6786710"," That's not really what it's doing right now. "
"6786890","6795010"," It's kind of just, it has millions and well, trillions of lines of text that it learned against."
"6795510","6801490"," And now it basically just figures out statistically how what the answer people want is."
"6801730","6804530"," And it gives you the answer that basically it thinks you want. "
"6806970","6812350"," So yeah, I mean, it is, it is the first time that AI has ever become AI."
"6812690","6816470"," But then again, there's nothing stopping chick from being the online tutor AI."
"6817130","6817770"," You know what I mean?"
"6818330","6828790"," Yeah, I don't think that my suspicion would be that when I want to say what the chat GPT began"
"6828790","6837770"," to ramp, what, let's say two months ago, maybe three months ago, like ramp in the public like"
"6837770","6845410"," when they actually let users and well, I guess that point would be is that can check maneuver that"
"6845410","6848450"," quickly to meet that demand?"
"6849470","6850590"," Probably not. "
"6850610","6856010"," They probably want to watch wait and see their their c-suites probably slow."
"6856710","6863450"," Make you figure I would not shock me when chat GPT started to become like just even introduced to"
"6863450","6872370"," the zikest that it would still take them months if not further to pivot for that eventuality."
"6873170","6874950"," Yeah, I mean, it's okay. "
"6875050","6883130"," So like, here's another profit education."
"6884330","6886910"," Like, it's not it's almost like smoking."
"6887570","6892190"," Like, when I first learned what chick did, I was like, okay, like that should just be some shit"
"6892190","6893330"," that the government provide. "
"6893550","6895770"," Like, the Department of Education should have to check."
"6896170","6900630"," You go to the DOE's website and it's basically what check is."
"6900830","6906570"," That's like, does it really know that that's bad for society?"
"6907210","6909730"," You subtract a shareholder thing from it. "
"6910010","6910650"," I mean, that sucks."
"6911150","6916710"," But then again, you know, companies disappear all day."
"6916870","6917830"," It's a tech company, right?"
"6917970","6919610"," That's kind of the risk that you're taking. "
"6921290","6925630"," You know, but you can also like, okay, so Chig is a good example, but you could also look at"
"6925630","6926930"," like, do a lingo, man."
"6927310","6928210"," Look at that stock."
"6928550","6929450"," How high is that stock?"
"6929670","6934770"," Are we going to need to learn new languages if you can just talk into your phone and the phone"
"6934770","6938930"," talks to the person in the language and the exact dialect and the you know, it's weird. "
"6939410","6945010"," My kids use we do we use do so we teach our children languages."
"6945470","6950490"," I mean, it is useful and it does help your brain like it's not that dude."
"6950490","6955570"," It's only like I don't do a lingo once you begin to learn a language. "
"6956110","6960350"," It's not as good as you think it is."
"6961170","6961710"," All right."
"6961810","6969350"," We don't we don't find do a lingo to be as it's like an it's like an open it's like"
"6969350","6970990"," an introduction only at best. "
"6971810","6972230"," Right."
"6972410","6977410"," That's kind of like how that's kind of like what I was saying though, like, like is that's almost"
"6977410","6979130"," another tutoring stock."
"6979430","6979910"," You know what I mean?"
"6980170","6986050"," Like it's supposed to teach you something that's a complex and they kind of like gamify it and make"
"6986050","6990330"," it like you get sparkles if you say this phrase correctly. "
"6990630","6998290"," It's really it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't do a good job of you of you understanding a language."
"6998710","6999030"," Right."
"6999390","6999390"," Right. "
"6999990","6999990"," Okay."
"7000350","7002350"," So a GPT was doing lingo."
"7002490","7009870"," You just be speaking to it all the time and it would be speaking back to you all the time. "
"7009870","7010290"," You know what I mean?"
"7010910","7017590"," You could just have whole chat conversations in that language and like it could slowly correct you."
"7017910","7020490"," So like that might be one that people want to take a look at."
"7020650","7021750"," I mean, it's at $122. "
"7022650","7024850"," It has a zero PE ratio."
"7025550","7027310"," It's a $5 billion company."
"7028270","7034550"," I honestly never even knew it was public until I saw it on that a screener that we sometimes look"
"7034550","7034850"," at. "
"7036270","7041650"," It showed up there a couple times a few weeks ago and I was like, okay, well, but man, that"
"7041650","7049310"," stock is one that if they say anything about GPT on their earnings on five nine, it's not going to"
"7049310","7049910"," be $122."
"7050390","7050870"," No."
"7051350","7058630"," Unless they say they're going to be the GPT of languages and then in which case it'll probably"
"7058630","7058910"," double. "
"7059630","7066570"," You know what I'll do is I'll maybe I'll ask my daughter to they use it every day maybe they"
"7066570","7068050"," can send an email and say it's good to get it."
"7068050","7073490"," I'd think it'd be shocked if you like contact them and said give me plans for AI."
"7074570","7078250"," Some dumbass that answers the phone might answer yes, not knowing that you're. "
"7078250","7081630"," This is another good tip for anybody that owns stocks."
"7082630","7090530"," A lot of times if you just email and you're in the name, you can contact people like companies and"
"7090530","7095810"," be like, yeah, can you send me a deck about this and that like as long as it's not like"
"7095810","7099330"," confidential information or, you know, materials."
"7099610","7101390"," So you can talk to those companies. "
"7101390","7104290"," They have public relations investing teams."
"7104450","7105150"," That's what they do."
"7105910","7113530"," I've called companies and just tried to speak to people in different on different desks just like"
"7113530","7118810"," find contact numbers and then ask questions like, hey, I'm not like, non, I'm an investor. "
"7119290","7121770"," Just are you doing this right now or can I expect this?"
"7121890","7122690"," I'm a customer of yours."
"7123950","7128810"," Do you have any plans for this coming out or I'm potentially buying a bunch of security cameras?"
"7129090","7131590"," I want to go through you guys."
"7132110","7135370"," What do I talk to for ordering these cameras?"
"7135750","7138270"," I heard you guys are going to develop these things that are real coming. "
"7138490","7145410"," You might get like somebody that doesn't, most of your people in a company are not focused on the"
"7145410","7147210"," price of a stock when they get asked."
"7147210","7149110"," The stream is sponsored by Tixra."
"7149190","7154850"," Yeah, and like a lot of the, I mean, a lot of the content for most companies are just like,"
"7155050","7159150"," yeah, it's just like a call center attached to the then desk. "
"7159570","7159670"," Yeah."
"7159750","7165570"," I mean, it's not like, it's not like any of those people have any like, direct, but if you do"
"7165570","7172370"," go to the investors department, those people have to be trained and basically ninjas that don't"
"7172370","7173910"," violate the SEC rules."
"7174210","7180010"," Yeah, if you go through the, if you go through like the investor channels, that's a pro or that"
"7180010","7180650"," they're going to know. "
"7180870","7185450"," But if you're just like calling up being like, Hey, man, I want to buy or are you going to"
"7185450","7185890"," ever add AI?"
"7185890","7186910"," I have a long time user."
"7187370","7192810"," My point was is that sometimes you can learn things that the rest of the market don't know."
"7192970","7201970"," Yeah, just basically the investors at whatever.com, but it's not like a legal information. "
"7202190","7204230"," It's not like an insider information is something."
"7204650","7206570"," It's like, I'll give you a quick example."
"7206890","7208410"," So like that company boot bar, right?"
"7208930","7212250"," Nobody's ever heard of boot bar except for me and Jim Kramer. "
"7212830","7213930"," He told me to buy that."
"7214010","7214530"," I should have $13."
"7215150","7216090"," They went up to like 110. "
"7216930","7217650"," I love boot bar."
"7217850","7219930"," I love boot bar, freakin awesome."
"7220250","7225650"," But my point is, is like, the reason that I knew like I wanted to be in it was because"
"7225650","7227570"," they brought one to Ohio. "
"7228150","7231390"," It's the first like, they're, you know, they're growing."
"7231610","7232630"," It's apparent, right?"
"7232930","7234510"," You know, like they're putting up these stores."
"7234710","7241350"," And this was during COVID, like they were building out new giant country, Western workwear stores"
"7241350","7243910"," in the middle of the pandemic. "
"7244950","7246090"," You know what I'm saying?"
"7246490","7246490"," Yeah."
"7246710","7250570"," They're like talking, we're 100% word all engines go."
"7251170","7257090"," So if you see something like that, I mean, it's not being picked up by the by by. "
"7257410","7261150"," It's not being picked up by any nobody gives a shit about boot barn."
"7261850","7264130"," Like, like, you know what I mean?"
"7264310","7269890"," Like, so if you're like just driving around in your town and you see, like, Oh, shit, like, or, you"
"7269890","7272110"," know, we just got a Shake Shack close to me."
"7272110","7277930"," And there's like two in the whole state, basically, you start seeing like new brands and stuff pop"
"7277930","7285350"," up around you, like, you know, you can use those types of signals as things to look at and invest"
"7285350","7289610"," in, you know, it doesn't always have to be like Twitter and Reddit and like. "
"7290370","7292130"," And that's two things."
"7292450","7293230"," I'm going to come back to that."
"7293370","7294130"," This is to your point. "
"7294990","7296610"," Well, first I want to tell people out there."
"7296710","7300090"," So if you're watching right now, and you think we're going to crash through this green box or"
"7300090","7304770"," something like that, remember earlier, what I was saying to you is if we don't get the new high"
"7304770","7309610"," here, watch my cursor, right, we'll come back down and check the five minutes."
"7310270","7312910"," We're coming into 1127 right now. "
"7313290","7318230"," We're going to find out if the next hour is bullish, right?"
"7318410","7324170"," So into 1130, we want to see by 1130 1133 a new high."
"7324530","7330550"," If we don't get the new high into the new hour, we can roll below this green box."
"7330950","7335730"," So pay attention into this next hour until the 1130 hour. "
"7336050","7343650"," Now back to what Winky's saying, he's giving or using a vehicle and he's circling back to what he's"
"7343650","7347490"," saying to you earlier about, you can trade the things that you know."
"7347690","7351870"," If you see that boot barns opening up down the street of Shake Shack is expanding."
"7352570","7360250"," If you see your teenage daughter using like kids or early adopters oftentimes and publicly traded"
"7360250","7364070"," companies, product offerings. "
"7364890","7369870"," So like if you see a company like Hasbro, let's say they made a fidget spinner for the first time"
"7369870","7374370"," and they're a publicly traded company and you see all your kids and their kids friends or you see"
"7374370","7379370"," you're out drinking at a bar and you see all the women are owning a certain hand bag, something"
"7379370","7379750"," like that."
"7379930","7385790"," Or if you go to a I don't know, like a rodeo and you see guys using pink tutus or"
"7385790","7386150"," something."
"7386930","7390950"," It's coming from Lulu Mon that you can kind of get inference from this. "
"7391590","7397810"," Yeah, I mean, you can you can have your own edge like and not even think about it as an"
"7397810","7399110"," edge, basically."
"7399630","7399710"," Yeah."
"7400270","7403370"," You know, anything that I'm like, well, this is kind of a stupid idea. "
"7403750","7404910"," It usually works."
"7406070","7411190"," Like if you're like, this is the most basic thing, like during the pandemic, I would drive by a"
"7411190","7411590"," Toyota."
"7411790","7415010"," There's like three Toyota dealerships in a mile in my house. "
"7415010","7417750"," I don't know why this is the case, but it's just the way it is."
"7418030","7422670"," And I would just drive by a Toyota dealerships and there's not a single car in the lot."
"7422870","7424330"," We're probably going to keep buying Ford. "
"7425290","7425790"," You know what I mean?"
"7425970","7431810"," Like, and then once those Toyota started filling in that lot, I was like, okay, Ford's done and"
"7431810","7432530"," that was $21."
"7434090","7443210"," So like, just look around basically, like, you know, there's always something to do."
"7443550","7444870"," There's always an opportunity. "
"7445530","7447970"," There's always the next thing."
"7448410","7453310"," So, you know, as long as you can go back to my point about the slot machine thing, as long"
"7453310","7458990"," as you don't get completely blown out of the water, like, you know, you can always make it back or"
"7458990","7460290"," fight another day."
"7461450","7466450"," If you're looking for puts here, if you're a bear, I see someone in chat said, when are we buying"
"7466450","7466750"," puts?"
"7467950","7475090"," You're looking for price to go under these green bars to go under the white line here. "
"7479180","7489100"," And you want to watch this white line curve down and you'll look for a rejection"
"7489100","7490280"," above right here."
"7491280","7497100"," And you can set the trade up, but you don't execute it until you're right here."
"7498480","7505540"," If so, if we're, if this chart was upside down and we were bottoming and trying to buy a dip,"
"7507160","7514540"," pretend this chart was upside down, you would want to still wait for price to get above the five"
"7514540","7517940"," minute 27 EMA before you took the log. "
"7518400","7525740"," If you run this trade 10 times, 100 times this put trade right here, you would blow your account"
"7525740","7526140"," up."
"7526640","7533140"," You might be right this time, but over time you are unlikely to be right."
"7533920","7540760"," And what my example here would be if we begin to roll down here and instead of instead of rolling"
"7540760","7547600"," straight down here, you begin to trade sideways, you get cut up in here, and then theta picks in at"
"7547600","7550880"," the 230 hour or something like that, you're going to get torched. "
"7551220","7556900"," We ended up consolidating this white line instead of rolling down begins to those sideways."
"7556900","7561900"," And then we make that last rip up into the close, you're going to get torched right."
"7562780","7568280"," So if you're trying to time a top here as a bear, this is likely not your place. "
"7568580","7574240"," Yeah, you would want this, my point, basis points, not born or not, not where the real money is as"
"7574240","7574560"," a bear."
"7574940","7580020"," You want to see price get underneath this white, this white line that's curved right here, you want"
"7580020","7585120"," to see price underneath it and a rejection to target down below it, 40850."
"7586240","7596120"," You could, you might call it once, and I want to try to harp on this the"
"7596120","7596980"," past month or so. "
"7597460","7606020"," There will always be someone that made the right choice and it can give a false sense"
"7606020","7613440"," to traders and investors that cap was wrong or cap was right."
"7614620","7619020"," So it's like this, it's called an antidote to evidence."
"7620020","7628360"," So if you had 10, if you had 20 people in chat and 10 people took a long here, right?"
"7629500","7635680"," Let's say 10 people took a long here and some calls right where we are right now and 10 people"
"7635680","7637300"," took 10 or took the puts here. "
"7637680","7639580"," And I'm talking to you about this."
"7640300","7646420"," Well, let's say we go down, you'll see 10 people in chat say, whoo, I called it."
"7646620","7648380"," And you'll be like, shit, I should have bought puts. "
"7649400","7653260"," If we go up, the other 10 people will comment in chat."
"7653760","7655440"," Hey, I called it."
"7655540","7655920"," It was calls. "
"7656320","7656840"," Does that make sense?"
"7657600","7667480"," So there's what you're saying, but it seems like someone"
"7667480","7669940"," was, it seems like, hey, I should have went with that call."
"7669940","7672960"," So it's like a false, false narrative."
"7672960","7678040"," It's like, it's counter alpha or yeah, there's all sorts of things like recent sea bias. "
"7678040","7682160"," You might get one of those and then you double your next trade, you lose all of it."
"7682400","7685780"," Like, yeah, you know, it's just a big cycle out head."
"7686120","7692080"," Yeah, so if you're when I talk to you about this trade specifically of us rolling over here, I'm"
"7692080","7701380"," trying to teach you the high probability win on that trade, not following what the chat room says. "
"7701480","7701960"," Okay."
"7703040","7705000"," So does that make sense?"
"7705220","7709600"," So if you're listening to me talk to you on a stream, I'm trying to teach you, hey, if you"
"7709600","7712140"," want to, if you want to capitalize a role here."
"7712620","7718280"," Now, there is another thing here that I don't talk about often, but I do share a white paper on,"
"7718360","7723100"," and that is if we're as long as we are above the white line, you are long. "
"7724040","7727920"," You could own the S&P 500, you could own a $10 stock."
"7728460","7728980"," It doesn't matter."
"7729740","7733320"," You are long above the white line on the five minute. "
"7734940","7738880"," Now, there you do want to look at the hourly in the in the 15 minute and the daily and"
"7738880","7739600"," all that kind of stuff."
"7740180","7747900"," But if the if the market rolls here, you could then short a stock or short the S&P 500"
"7747900","7749320"," or buy some puts."
"7750240","7752820"," Now, I'm not going to get into the mechanics of how this works. "
"7754060","7755980"," That would cover your long trip."
"7756160","7760340"," So let's say, let's say your bias is we're going up here, right?"
"7761420","7763280"," So you right now you buy some calls, right?"
"7763980","7766020"," So you get a 10 pack of calls we're going up."
"7767160","7773580"," And we begin to roll over here and it confirms the downside move, right?"
"7774860","7780540"," You could either let those calls burn and take on some puts to break even. "
"7781080","7786820"," So hey, my thesis was wrong, but I'm at least not going to lose money on the day, or you"
"7786820","7788860"," would put a stop loss here in your calls."
"7789700","7792960"," And let's say you buy calls for a dollar and they go down to 50 cents."
"7793620","7798520"," So you're now upside down 50 cents because it broke to the downside, but you're then going to wait"
"7798520","7803460"," for the confirmation that you're going lower, you'll jump on the put side. "
"7804320","7806720"," And that would actually pay for the 50 cents that you lost."
"7806920","7811620"," And hopefully you'd make some extra money on the on that side too, maybe next 10 cents or 30 cents"
"7811620","7812120"," or something."
"7812660","7819060"," This this works self out on all kinds of timeframes like one day, monthly, weeklies, all that kind"
"7819060","7819340"," of stuff. "
"7819560","7823780"," So just be conscious of that there's two sides to this trade either way."
"7824320","7828520"," If you're a bull here, you're looking for a test."
"7829480","7831380"," We're rolling over right now. "
"7832760","7835460"," You're looking for a test of this white line."
"7835460","7840220"," You want to see price touch right here."
"7840780","7842800"," There are some signs here of what's happening. "
"7842800","7846280"," You can see the consolidation taking place, right?"
"7847100","7849120"," You know, there are sellers above."
"7849760","7850860"," There's resistance here."
"7850940","7851840"," There's supply here. "
"7852460","7855820"," And you want to find out if there's demand."
"7856880","7865640"," Okay, so we are expecting we're positing that there's demand here, right here, that there are"
"7865640","7867080"," buyers waiting."
"7867460","7870020"," We think there are buyers waiting here. "
"7870280","7873080"," So as the sellers step in, they're going to push price down."
"7873080","7877900"," And if there are more buyers and sellers, we're going to get a reaction to the upside."
"7878520","7883920"," If we find that there are no buyers here, we'll begin to find out where we know the next level"
"7883920","7884780"," of buyers are. "
"7884920","7885880"," That's down here, right?"
"7886340","7891420"," You pause it that there are new buyers or smart money is lower, right?"
"7891700","7893940"," Something like that and that we're going to roll here."
"7894660","7896420"," So just keep all that in mind."
"7896420","7902920"," And then also keep in mind is when you see the white line vertical, it's more bullish, see this"
"7902920","7904340"," white line right here, see how it's going up. "
"7904940","7905700"," That's more bullish."
"7906160","7907920"," When it's sideways, it's less bullish."
"7908480","7908720"," It's neutral. "
"7909400","7911220"," And when it's heading down, it's more bearish."
"7911360","7914320"," This actually leads you ahead of this."
"7914600","7916280"," This actually begins to lead you. "
"7917220","7922840"," So if price is starting to roll sideways, it's telling you we're in a decision here, right?"
"7923520","7929120"," If we start to bounce up and the white line begins to head higher, it's telling you we're bullish"
"7929120","7929460"," here."
"7930200","7930780"," It makes sense."
"7931260","7938000"," So instead of trying to predict if we're heading higher or not, sometimes better for you to set the"
"7938000","7940620"," trade up and wait for it to prove to you. "
"7940900","7943140"," So let's say you're like, oh, no cap, I'm bullish here."
"7943860","7949780"," Then what you're going to be doing is you're going to set the trade up, not buy it, but wait"
"7949780","7953880"," for for confirmation to the upside."
"7954000","7956200"," And then you capture this part of the trade right here. "
"7956820","7958400"," You don't need the entire trade."
"7958420","7960060"," You just need some of it in here."
"7960700","7961240"," That makes sense. "
"7961420","7962640"," You need this money right here."
"7963080","7965400"," You don't need this bullshit down here."
"7965800","7967460"," That's like shit you don't need to be a part of. "
"7968260","7969260"," That makes sense to you guys?"
"7969940","7970980"," I don't know if it does or doesn't."
"7971100","7971300"," Whatever."
"7971540","7972120"," Let's get back to Winky. "
"7972360","7975620"," So Winky, how about this?"
"7977300","7984020"," I wanted to ask you about shit."
"7984160","7985600"," I had a big question for you."
"7989920","7992620"," Let me ask people in chat, what do you guys want to ask Winky?"
"7998020","7999920"," David's put some good points on YouTube right now. "
"7999920","8004480"," He's saying, in my rules, I always look for the high of the session made between 11 a.m. and"
"8004480","8005980"," 1 p.m. Eastern Standard Time."
"8006120","8007000"," I agree with that, David."
"8007740","8011970"," I just wanted to call out Disney. "
"8012910","8013450"," Yeah, do it."
"8013490","8013790"," Say something."
"8014770","8016950"," I just wanted to call out Price and Disney. "
"8017090","8020370"," It's 99.23. They report on 510."
"8022370","8025290"," And also a first time chatter, Whitey Red's"
"8025290","8035190"," is saying there's also"
"8035190","8037670"," a third where we go flat after buying the put hedge, right?"
"8038110","8039110"," That's another question here."
"8039710","8044730"," A bunch of people on both YouTube and I want to say thank you to all of you in the"
"8044730","8051090"," chat right now that are dropping your trading rules in the chat right now because those all hold"
"8051090","8051370"," true. "
"8051870","8052910"," I agree with all those rules."
"8053070","8054650"," I use all those same rules as well."
"8054950","8060970"," I've got a list in my brain that's 100 rules long and I'm trying to go through them all when"
"8060970","8061330"," I'm trading. "
"8062290","8064870"," And I think about all those same things you guys are talking about."
"8064870","8066390"," So please always say those things."
"8066570","8070190"," When I'm saying something, chat about those rules and you guys want to put your own rules in,"
"8070350","8072510"," definitely add those because it only helps. "
"8074150","8076810"," I want to address the question on the YouTube from Nick."
"8077510","8080090"," It says, Winky is shorting with banks is banned."
"8080530","8081850"," Do you see SoFi and Moon?"
"8082510","8084050"," It's been beat down for so long. "
"8085890","8090890"," So my thoughts on stocks like SoFi, a firm, etc."
"8091330","8094110"," are those are FinTechs, right?"
"8094930","8104430"," And during their meteoric rise to fame, everybody was like, well, don't buy VAC because that's not"
"8104430","8105170"," a FinTech."
"8105530","8107770"," I SoFi because that's a FinTech. "
"8108310","8113370"," Don't buy JPN because they're going to get destroyed by a firm."
"8114250","8114970"," All that stuff."
"8115170","8121150"," So I don't necessarily see SoFi as a regional bank. "
"8122670","8131070"," Like, I don't know that you can you can reclassify it when it makes sense to you."
"8131490","8132610"," I'm not trying to be short."
"8132930","8133830"," I'm not trying to be flipping. "
"8134390","8136070"," I'm just saying I don't mess this."
"8136310","8143890"," There's so many other regional bank, like actual like regional banks stood up already that, you"
"8143890","8149330"," know, I don't think you have to go that deep into the chain to find an opportunity."
"8149570","8150710"," You know what I'm saying?"
"8151070","8152590"," Yeah, I think that was a good question. "
"8152810","8153210"," Thank you."
"8153430","8154350"," That's a good question."
"8154910","8158690"," And I think about, I think about two things. "
"8159110","8168150"," I think one that comes down to personal preference, like bill, bill screamed higher on it's ER"
"8168150","8168690"," yesterday."
"8169350","8171430"," Like, I love bill the stock."
"8171690","8171990"," I love it. "
"8173150","8177210"," But I got what I wanted out of it for me personally."
"8177450","8178470"," It's like my personal preference."
"8178470","8184670"," I'm on to the next, the next growth spectrum company. "
"8186570","8187410"," Yeah, 100%."
"8187410","8189290"," Sometimes trades are bad."
"8189850","8190290"," You know what I mean?"
"8190850","8191270"," Yeah. "
"8191570","8192629"," So like, I like bill."
"8192870","8193430"," I like the company."
"8193790","8194610"," I like it as a stock. "
"8195270","8200190"," But for me, I'm like, I'm going to now start looking at some new stuff for the next Wall Street,"
"8200190","8204389"," that game stock that happens in a year or two on it or three years on it."
"8204690","8206129"," So I'm not like anti bill."
"8206830","8214490"," But that also leads into the last part, which is to your point, which is we made that point"
"8214490","8222570"," yesterday, which was falling in love with a ticker when you can, if you love so far, like if anyone"
"8222570","8228209"," says, like, I shouldn't say if anyone says, but because I do love certain tickers of certain"
"8228209","8228650"," companies. "
"8229270","8232730"," Like, I know Disney's not getting fucking is not going into a bank."
"8233809","8239889"," Like, not my main street hat on, but my, my, my trading hat."
"8240290","8247809"," I like the stock, but, but it's so much better to your point. "
"8247809","8257450"," To have that list of 1000 or 100 or tickers and a basket that rotates so that you don't drink"
"8257450","8259090"," the Kool-Aid on any ticker out there."
"8260350","8266570"," That's one of the, like the first five years I traded, well, no, when I was trading stocks, I went"
"8266570","8276270"," through like, hitting stocks and you need to move up trade options on tech companies, but I drank"
"8276270","8279370"," too much Kool-Aid for a long time."
"8279490","8280370"," I'm a believer. "
"8282610","8285370"," I lost a lot of money from that."
"8285590","8293750"," I guess to Winky's point now would be, if you don't have a basket of 1000 tickers that you're"
"8293750","8298809"," watching out there, if you don't have a thousand, or a hundred, it barely has to be a thousand."
"8299110","8299490"," Or a hundred. "
"8299690","8306709"," Yeah, I mean, just the ones that, whatever you feel comfortable, like knowing, basically, like, if"
"8306709","8312850"," you have the, if you're busy and you don't have time to like, go to a boot barn 80 miles"
"8312850","8316549"," from your house, because you got other things going on."
"8316549","8319230"," Maybe that's not the right stock for you, but that's what I did."
"8319230","8322490"," I drove to this thing and saw what it was and went in it. "
"8322770","8324590"," And that's what I did."
"8324930","8327530"," I think the only recommendation I have here though is that you build the list."
"8328170","8335030"," Yeah, you have to have, you have to have like a list because a lot of times you'll see dislocations"
"8335030","8342610"," or what you could, I guess, causation or correlation, depending on how you frame it, between"
"8342610","8343510"," different stocks. "
"8343889","8349990"," Like, there was a day, I don't know, it was probably last year, where Liz Hoover had some really"
"8349990","8354389"," good news, and then Liz was halted on the really good news."
"8355030","8361049"," And I was like, I'm gonna short-living shit at a list, because, you know, like, you have to have"
"8361049","8366049"," pairs, you have to be watching, like, especially in something where it's like, Uber and Lyft, and"
"8366049","8367889"," that's the only two companies in a segment."
"8368530","8376290"," It's like, you know, watch what the other one's doing also, you know, like, you can't just, like,"
"8376370","8381150"," even with the banks, like, I own like seven different financials, but I damn sure watch what all"
"8381150","8382510"," their competitors are doing. "
"8384350","8391910"," Yeah, and to that point too would be when they don't move."
"8392670","8397470"," And like, or someone was saying to me, a good friend of the show was like, well, should I just"
"8397470","8404010"," buy, I think it was BBBY or AMC or one of the eighth tickers, and they were like, well, it's"
"8404010","8405830"," so low right now, why don't I just buy it?"
"8405970","8413290"," And I was like, yeah, well, I realize it's low, but I realize it's likely gonna squeeze in the"
"8413290","8418930"," coming weeks, but you're now trapped, you're now can't employ money anywhere else."
"8420210","8425650"," If something else starts to go on a run, you're then possibly take a loss by being trapped against"
"8425650","8433270"," the pound that goes back to that whole idea of 185 pence, last down zero, spot four sectors,"
"8433270","8435210"," segments of sectors. "
"8435730","8437290"," Yeah, I only trade this one stock."
"8437570","8441850"," I think you, if you're, if I was young, I would say to you, however you lost all of your"
"8441850","8448770"," money, my recommend is always go to the, I think the indexes are some of the, some of on higher"
"8448770","8453930"," timeframes are some of the easiest money makers out there, you have to learn each index, and then"
"8453930","8460030"," you have to, then you start to learn about tech, individual tickers, and then you learn about, you"
"8460030","8466030"," know, I don't know, fucking airlines, or whatever it is, your poison is, but to expose around,"
"8466030","8473490"," around different sectors, right, like the way that I got started was I bought, I don't know, I was"
"8473490","8480690"," probably like 20 or something, and like, I don't know why, but for some reason back then I was"
"8480690","8486530"," really super into watching Fox Business, like I'd worked like 20 hours, and then I'd go home and"
"8486530","8489130"," watch Fox Business, it made no sense at all."
"8489410","8495950"," Anyway, so like, I just got suckered into some like, bullshit, like 68 cent tech, you know, like"
"8495950","8501350"," everybody does, like you get, you get in there, and you basically get Wolf of Wall Street, I feel"
"8501350","8508370"," like you have to go through your period of time, or Jordan Balfour is selling you stocks, like, and"
"8508370","8513350"," then you're just like, yeah, I think I'd rather, you know, because you're like, okay, so and I get"
"8513350","8519370"," the math, you're like, I could buy 10 million shares of this 12 cent stock, but that's like, you're"
"8519370","8522850"," the only one that owns that stock, you know what I mean?"
"8523690","8527410"," Like I said earlier, when you're playing poker, you got to sit on the table of somebody else's"
"8527410","8532610"," playing at, it's gonna be you and the dealer, you don't want to play a game where it's you and"
"8532610","8537010"," the dealer, man, like, that's not the game you want to play. "
"8538390","8540710"," I agree, but they have to go through that, right?"
"8540870","8542030"," I think all new investors."
"8542030","8549330"," Yeah, I mean, you kind of do, and it's sort of like, so like, if I hadn't mined crypto for"
"8549330","8555810"," free in 2011, I might have got swept up in that, but it just depends on like how you approach"
"8555810","8557530"," where you approach things from."
"8557530","8563050"," So like, I did it from an R&B standpoint, I was actually looking at it from a, is this"
"8563050","8570250"," a viable thing to run a business up on, and I just accumulated some, like, coin and ether, and it's"
"8570250","8574410"," just been sitting in a wall, like, my cost basis is zero. "
"8574570","8578350"," So that's the only thing about crypto, my cost basis and all that crypto is zero dollars."
"8578610","8584310"," And when I mined it, it was like, worst, like, aggregates of a penny."
"8584850","8590010"," So like, anytime I sell any of it, I have to, on my taxes, I have to put like the"
"8590010","8595210"," date it was mined, what the price was, it's like an aggregate of a penny and I'll sell it for"
"8595210","8595650"," like $100. "
"8596690","8601170"," So that, like, think like, that's how I know it's kind of a, of him not going to say a"
"8601170","8606510"," scam, but how I know it's a no sum game is because it's really easy."
"8606650","8612490"," You can spend like a million dollars in new Bitcoin, like $3,000 a coin."
"8613250","8620710"," And you could spend a million dollars in advertising and move it like $10,000, you know what I"
"8620710","8620870"," mean?"
"8621070","8626670"," So like, it's, it's, that's why I don't get in it, but it's like, like, the whole point of that"
"8626670","8632730"," was like, you know, meet the market where you're at, like the things that you know, that, you know,"
"8633210","8638330"," you can always find something to do if you kind of look at it from that standpoint. "
"8639830","8645950"," I was, I lived in, I don't know if I should say this or not, I think it was between"
"8645950","8649430"," 07 and 2011."
"8650890","8658030"," I was living there longer than that, but at that time I was living in Park City and I was"
"8658030","8665310"," renting a condo there for a duplex and my landlord lived in the side of the duplex."
"8665690","8669070"," He was an engineer at the local community television. "
"8669750","8673350"," I think we're, I think we're after the ticket."
"8675050","8677270"," The statute of limitations?"
"8677650","8678610"," Yeah, I think we're past this."
"8678750","8687190"," No names, but he was, now before that I had traded Bitcoin, well, not traded, I bought Bitcoin to"
"8687190","8694130"," use on Silk Road and stuff, but he turned beyond to mining Bitcoin way back then, and he was doing"
"8694130","8700490"," it out of using their servers to mine Bitcoin with fucking worthless. "
"8701610","8703870"," Like, utterly, he's rich now."
"8704290","8710750"," Oh, I thought this was, I thought this was one of the stories where he had like, 38,000 Bitcoin"
"8710750","8712250"," and he bought a sub with it."
"8713770","8715250"," Did you hear that?"
"8715550","8718750"," Yeah, the stories are like, somebody had like, y'all don't know. "
"8719150","8720010"," Yeah, yeah."
"8720370","8722330"," You're like, God damn it."
"8722450","8723190"," I did that. "
"8723670","8724390"," I did."
"8724630","8728410"," So I, so what I did was, there was a halving that took place."
"8729550","8730710"," I got rid of a bunch. "
"8730890","8737970"," So I was, I had a bunch of Bitcoin for many years and then back in, last time I got"
"8737970","8741890"," rid of it was the last halving, I got rid of a bunch of it."
"8743950","8748370"," But there was a halving before that I got rid of a bunch of it, but I got my, my"
"8748370","8753170"," wife at the time thought I was crazy and I, when I owned Bitcoin when it was zero, I think"
"8753170","8759850"," the last amount that I had of it was like three or four thousand dollars worth when it was like"
"8759850","8764130"," 0.00002 or something like that."
"8764590","8769930"," And my wife was like, my wife thought I was crazy at the time. "
"8770090","8772210"," I was like, yeah, I was like, this is going to be something someday."
"8772650","8775150"," And my neighbor is mining it out of his ass."
"8775150","8776390"," He's filthy rich now. "
"8776550","8777650"," Like big mistake in my life."
"8778630","8779070"," State."
"8779750","8780190"," State. "
"8781510","8782850"," I don't listen to it anymore."
"8782950","8783970"," I accumulate shit now."
"8784450","8790810"," If you mind Bitcoin, so I got into it late and this was like 2011. "
"8791530","8797290"," Yeah, I got in, you know, I, so I mine like coin and then in 20, I don't know, like"
"8797290","8799430"," 20, even ever easier appeared."
"8799510","8803670"," I started mining that too because that one was actually the promise of either was that it would"
"8803670","8808810"," actually have a utility, but it doesn't necessarily actually have any utility yet."
"8808970","8809390"," Maybe it will. "
"8809810","8810310"," I don't know."
"8812170","8817390"," But yeah, man, it's like, if you mind it, you're at the top of the pyramid scheme."
"8817570","8827530"," Like if you think of a traditional pyramid scheme, like a Bernie Madoff kind of"
"8827530","8830350"," your actual cost basis is like you said here. "
"8831430","8838210"," Like you can spend an unlimited amount of money trying to get other people to buy that shit."
"8838830","8842230"," And all you have to do is push it up a couple bucks and you're a millionaire."
"8842670","8848690"," It was so so this was the so I just looked it up right now because that summer he had"
"8848690","8852750"," been mining it for about two years a year or two at that point. "
"8852830","8854490"," That was the summer of 2012."
"8855570","8858370"," So it was right around when that's when you were like super."
"8858510","8862510"," Yeah, that was when I started mining with light coin, essentially. "
"8862870","8863030"," Yeah."
"8863550","8863910"," Yeah."
"8864610","8867190"," Bitcoin at that point was getting into the fight. "
"8867190","8868610"," He needed like multiple GPUs."
"8869030","8871630"," Yeah, I was like, yeah, that's all right."
"8871970","8873650"," Yes, he started running it at this. "
"8873950","8877990"," And no one knew like at that time, he's, well, he's an engineer at the TV studio."
"8878550","8879870"," Yeah, he got free power."
"8880230","8880650"," Yeah. "
"8881050","8882910"," And computing."
"8883270","8883970"," Yeah, free power."
"8884250","8887830"," And nobody's, of course, no one would suspect anything today. "
"8888150","8891430"," You know, I'm sure that they that they're watching this in companies."
"8891430","8892690"," I'm hoping that they do."
"8893370","8899450"," But at that time, like no, but like unless you were buying like, I don't know, molly or ecstasy or"
"8899450","8904070"," something or mushrooms on Silk Road, like nobody knew about that shit. "
"8904650","8914690"," And 070809, like 2010, it was very like, very smart people, very like the tech pros were still, you"
"8914690","8917870"," could still meet a tech bro at Burning Man at that time and hang out with them."
"8919670","8920270"," Yeah."
"8920730","8926590"," That was like when everybody was looking out there, high school friends on Facebook, yes, yes. "
"8927610","8934130"," That was like the golden age of all of those foolish distractions."
"8935130","8941590"," I was a part of that age where like I was, so I was graduating high school when you wanted"
"8941590","8946550"," to be, it was like the peak of wanting to be in the, remember the book of fate, it wasn't"
"8946550","8951130"," book of fate, like Facebook book of faces, remember there was like a call you like you wanted to be"
"8951130","8954730"," in this book, like the who's who colleges around the United States."
"8954730","8956830"," Yeah, like guess what's it called?"
"8957350","8958630"," Year books and stuff. "
"8958870","8963690"," Not a high school year book, but there was like a book for, does anybody in the chat know what"
"8963690","8964230"," I'm talking about?"
"8964590","8969850"," Before Facebook, there was a like book of faces in an actual book."
"8971290","8976510"," That's like where the name of Facebook came, I think it was like the Facebook or something."
"8976910","8978430"," I think that's what they call it at schools. "
"8978730","8983930"," And that's why the name, that's why Facebook same used to be, there's a Facebook, I believe, and"
"8983930","8985250"," then they just dropped to the bell."
"8985610","8990470"," Yeah, like every year, every year there was, they put out a hardcover version of it, and it listed"
"8990470","8994190"," like everyone around the country, if you could get into that book, they may remember this."
"8994250","8996310"," And it was basically just like a hot or not?"
"8996930","9000610"," Yeah, it's not the, it's not the people we used, that's what people used it for. "
"9000930","9004930"," It was like, look through this book of all the people at the school and see who's hot and who"
"9004930","9009230"," isn't, and then that's how hot or not.com came about."
"9009910","9011710"," Yeah, I think it might have been news too."
"9011850","9012790"," It might have been news too. "
"9013310","9015010"," Yeah, it was something like that."
"9015210","9023710"," It actually, they tried to replace like, you know, that whole yearbook, the Facebook type thing was"
"9023710","9024070"," bad."
"9024410","9025730"," Yeah, I think that's what it was. "
"9025990","9028370"," And I remember that year, it didn't, it wasn't pot."
"9028570","9034010"," So at that time, I was living in, I was going to a small Catholic university near where Facebook"
"9034010","9034810"," was being developed."
"9035510","9040970"," And I remember when Facebook first came out, it was the, it was like, the whole talk was you have"
"9040970","9044010"," to get on Facebook, you have to get an invitation to Facebook. "
"9044790","9049670"," And of course, that was still, I think my space was at a peak at that point."
"9050990","9053510"," But I had, I never was a mid-my spacer."
"9053690","9054930"," I was never took to that. "
"9055230","9057290"," I was an AOL chatroom guy."
"9058270","9059350"," You remember the AOL chat rooms?"
"9059530","9065770"," Yeah, I mean, I had my, I had a MySpace and like, it had like the sparkly background and like"
"9065770","9068550"," a midi file song playing."
"9068890","9071170"," It was probably like, sublime or something. "
"9071550","9075430"," Like, Santa Rita or, you know, and it was a midi."
"9075730","9079470"," So all it was, it was like, tones, like, like the elevator music version."
"9079890","9086730"," You're like, and then, you know, everybody obviously had to have the count, the hit counter on"
"9086730","9092010"," their Facebook, because you need to know how many people came there to check you out, even though"
"9092010","9097710"," it was just you hitting F5 and refreshing over and over, because nobody even I remember parts of"
"9097710","9097910"," that. "
"9098050","9103890"," I did, I was on MySpace, but for a very brief time, I used it to, I used it to"
"9103890","9106690"," tell people about raves."
"9107710","9108710"," That's a true story."
"9109110","9112210"," So we would drop the, drop the location at the last moments. "
"9113190","9119870"," Okay, so you see the test right now taking place on the five minute trigger, right?"
"9120690","9122050"," What time is it?"
"9122750","9124250"," It's the half an hour."
"9124970","9126930"," It's 1158, right?"
"9127330","9135110"," Coming into the 12 o'clock hour, the bears are selling into the, into the half hour here."
"9135790","9139370"," And we're going to recheck to see if we're going higher or not. "
"9140470","9147470"," Now, if we don't get a new high in the next 15 minutes, possibly half an hour, but normally the"
"9147470","9154330"," next 15 minutes, if we don't, if we fail to get a new high right now, that will signal that"
"9154330","9155990"," we're going to roll over."
"9156770","9159150"," This is like one of the first little tiny tools that you have."
"9159430","9163570"," I have a white paper that I've been writing about this stuff for you guys out there. "
"9163770","9167010"," So you'll be able to, I'm gonna, as a matter of fact, Winky and I are working on some stuff"
"9167010","9167430"," in the background."
"9168030","9173250"," I'm going to have him look at this white paper and tear it to pieces so that we can release"
"9173250","9178850"," it to you so that you can read it and look for these signals as the market progresses."
"9179210","9183610"," So right now you're seeing the test of the five, the 27 EMA and the five minute chart. "
"9184410","9190630"," We're going to see if now spy can get a new high that signals that were going higher."
"9190910","9196590"," If it fails in the next 15 minutes, we're going to look for lower lows at 408-44."
"9198870","9200150"," All right, sorry, sorry, wait. "
"9200770","9201970"," No, that's cool, man."
"9202110","9202710"," You're doing your thing."
"9202970","9204610"," That's what everybody shows up for. "
"9204770","9208530"," Everybody shows up to hear me talk to you about stuff that nobody cares about."
"9209810","9212750"," This is like one, it's like one long ongoing class, right?"
"9213070","9214950"," Repeat, repeat, repeat, every day."
"9214950","9222430"," Yeah, the Kramer just doomed Apple, I'm reading. "
"9224310","9226650"," Yeah, I thought my space might make them come back."
"9227130","9233430"," I, in fact, I had an original AOL email address and I thought AOL would make it come back on"
"9233430","9235290"," like over Gmail at some point."
"9235450","9236630"," That still hasn't happened. "
"9236850","9240870"," I use it every once in a, you know, there's a AOL.com address is still work."
"9241270","9241530"," They do."
"9241670","9242250"," Yeah, they're cool. "
"9242430","9247350"," Which blows my mind because I believe it's Verizon that now is AOL and Yahoo."
"9248310","9252750"," Like, and everybody's going to Gmail and then you're just like, here's my, you know, capjimjames."
"9252850","9253570"," AOL.com."
"9253790","9259590"," I mean, it's kind of like, I mean, it's kind of like you get creded for having like your name. "
"9259810","9262070"," Like imagine if you were like Dave at AOL."
"9262710","9268050"," I was like a pussy slayer, 69, 420, uh, one, two, three, four, five, six."
"9268090","9272990"," So I can't use it anymore because when you're, when you're a kid, you use horrible names. "
"9273750","9279270"," Yeah, internet was a lot crazier back in the day, of course."
"9280510","9284410"," Like, it was pretty, like my, my kids now, they do that."
"9284570","9289850"," Like my, my youngest daughter, her email addresses, I've got both her names as email addresses. "
"9289850","9299890"," But I'm like, I'm like, okay, sparkle eyes, pink pony, 2020, 2023,"
"9299890","9300310"," really?"
"9301610","9307290"," Yeah, that's kind of a weird situation when you have like your kids creating like, I mean, I"
"9307290","9309330"," imagine my son's grown up."
"9309510","9310410"," Basically, he's 15."
"9310990","9315750"," So, but when you have kids and they're trying to like manage like, I really want this Facebook"
"9315750","9318190"," thing and you're like, well, it's probably not a good idea. "
"9318210","9325710"," And then, you know, and then they pick like a hilarious username and you're like, okay, we, we're"
"9325710","9333370"," the they're like the battles, like, let me teach you about computing and not your phone."
"9334290","9340150"," We have to read some books on fables and mythology."
"9340850","9343770"," And now we're going to do civics and government. "
"9344490","9350270"," And I need you to be able to make up your own values and morals."
"9350990","9361790"," And then how that interplay or because the town square is now social"
"9361790","9369450"," media and how easy it is to control how you form your narratives is brutal."
"9370170","9371570"," Yeah, it is. "
"9371990","9372850"," You're exactly right."
"9373230","9373790"," 100%."
"9373790","9376590"," You know, the thing that I was thinking, I think I texted this to you. "
"9376910","9380610"," I was thinking about this, like, we were when the AI thing happened."
"9380610","9385330"," People have only had like digital computing devices for like 30 years."
"9386010","9391950"," And like, now we have AI, like, we haven't even like, we haven't even figured out like big tech"
"9391950","9393170"," regulations yet. "
"9393170","9394350"," And now we have AI."
"9395230","9400170"," It's talking to Joe Harper about the other or the other day, we're doing a Harper ever having a"
"9400170","9405230"," discussion about some of the other."
"9407130","9417050"," I personally became fearful when there wasn't as soon as AI became forefront"
"9417050","9418770"," of the national or the world discussion. "
"9419910","9428750"," Recently, I thought that most prudent thing would do an almost automatic blanket"
"9428750","9435750"," ban on it until it would be highly, become highly regulated."
"9437410","9439850"," And if it's, if that didn't happen, why?"
"9440390","9442910"," So positive question of why, what are the reasons?"
"9444090","9452570"," Not that I'm anti AI, just the first response to it is, just let it rot, just let it like,"
"9452690","9453790"," let it ride doggy."
"9455110","9462630"," Yeah, like, my, my honestly, my, like, thought about how this is going to work if somebody who's"
"9462630","9470330"," been like building the internet since 1996 is, there's going to be a cyber attack. "
"9470750","9475830"," There's going to be some AI driven attack on something."
"9476150","9481830"," It'll either be like market, finance based, something is going to happen."
"9482590","9485090"," And we're going to all have to take a step back. "
"9485270","9486510"," Like, that's what happens with everything."
"9486770","9488110"," Yeah, it's like, okay."
"9488410","9490690"," That's why kids used to get preyed upon on Facebook. "
"9490950","9492710"," And that's why they made laws."
"9493090","9502050"," But also, this is going to grow like the capabilities of the AI is going to grow so fast over"
"9502050","9506730"," the next five to 10 years that like, what are you even going to regulate against?"
"9507230","9512350"," Because it's going to be coming up with shit that we don't like, you know, it'll be good to the"
"9512350","9515190"," point where you're like telling the AI what the law is."
"9515350","9518590"," And then it's like, okay, here's how we get around that day. "
"9518790","9527750"," Yeah, like, the law says this, I may, I'll figure I'll have a circumvent that."
"9528050","9528670"," Okay, done."
"9529670","9533290"," Our conversation geared or veered towards two or three things. "
"9534990","9535670"," Stupidity."
"9535670","9537070"," People not understanding."
"9538470","9540150"," Second thing would be greed. "
"9541330","9548830"," And the third thing would be that some fear of who gets the power first."
"9549350","9552090"," So yeah, that's the Iran thing."
"9552170","9555690"," I thought was hilarious when he was like, everybody should stop. "
"9556170","9558470"," And it was just because he wasn't ready yet."
"9558750","9566310"," Yeah, like, well, I think even our federal government, my history suspicion here is, you know, you"
"9566310","9571430"," have to let AI out the box for it to progress."
"9572250","9574470"," So it's out of the box. "
"9575250","9577590"," There's nothing really the military can do to stop it."
"9577590","9582450"," And if it's out of the box in other countries, the military needs it out of the box to us"
"9582450","9585030"," so we can fight other nations for power."
"9585210","9590110"," We all know that behind whether whether you're like anti war and anti this, that we already know"
"9590110","9597270"," that there ruthless government, different forms of governments, corporations, governments,"
"9597710","9601770"," individuals that want to always stay ahead of the next person. "
"9602310","9605950"," Yeah, I mean, there are some countermeasures that you could there."
"9606070","9610950"," There are some things that like I would suggest that people do and basically it would be like"
"9610950","9617390"," before taking any AI model that is, you know, you're not really sure what's going to happen once it"
"9617390","9618010"," starts learning."
"9618230","9624530"," You have to have like a basically like a fake version of the internet with like it has to have"
"9624530","9626910"," all the access, all the information in the whole world. "
"9627130","9632750"," And then you have to just see what it does almost like tricking it into thinking it's blowing up"
"9632750","9633230"," the world."
"9633610","9634210"," You know what I mean?"
"9634390","9641710"," Like you connect it to a video game or something and it doesn't know it doesn't know like where it"
"9641710","9642410"," is, right?"
"9642710","9647150"," It it doesn't know if that's the real world or if it's like a simulation."
"9647910","9652010"," And then the other thing you have to do is you have to incentivize AI somehow. "
"9652370","9653570"," Compare the two, right?"
"9653790","9657290"," You compare two environments and make sure that it's not lying to you."
"9658010","9661970"," Yeah, you have to do it's like any other software project."
"9661970","9663710"," You're going to have to do beta tests. "
"9664010","9670410"," Like I'm sure GPT was tested as some degree, but I kind of feel like they sort of just drop"
"9670410","9671710"," that ship on day."
"9672590","9673850"," Yeah, I did."
"9674730","9681730"," This is a I love to I watch a bunch of MIT there's a guy at MIT and a guy"
"9681730","9682130"," at Harvard. "
"9682330","9690710"," There's a bunch of like long form stuff post that stuff on a chat someday for I don't started with"
"9690710","9700350"," the Elon and the in the podcasts and the like the I posted something about a girl on Twitter who's"
"9700350","9706090"," a physicist and she's like there's like there are actual physicists then there's people that are"
"9706090","9707410"," interested in physics."
"9707830","9710670"," Those are people that read the books and they listen to the podcasts."
"9712990","9720730"," So it's a so you'll see physics topics that are always front and center like in the public eye and"
"9720730","9723850"," then there then there's of course physicists, right?"
"9724090","9727490"," You want to actually listen to those people talk. "
"9728030","9730890"," Yeah, there's a hobbyist and then there's professionals."
"9730990","9735230"," Yeah, there's a hobbyist there are physicists that are really working on physics."
"9735850","9741430"," You want to get down to the actual people working on physics and what they think and I think that's"
"9741430","9742030"," the same thing applies. "
"9743630","9747410"," Anyways, yeah, leave the let these guys know inside stream right now."
"9747550","9748170"," Happy Friday everybody."
"9748970","9754050"," What you're looking for here if you're a bear as we discussed earlier is you're looking for price"
"9754050","9759910"," to break below the white line right here and confirm to move lower. "
"9765590","9771090"," So you're going to right and if you see the break below the white line right there you can then"
"9771090","9777250"," execute the put trade and have stops above some whatever your poison is you can put some stops here"
"9777250","9782230"," if you like you can put them up here if you like so you don't get squos or squeezed out"
"9782230","9787370"," you know there can be a trap here if you do get squeezed out in a put trade here it"
"9787370","9792190"," does begin to go higher just know that you're going to cut your losses and take some calls for the"
"9792190","9798250"," upside here makes sense so you don't get blown out in your in your positive or your theory and have"
"9798250","9802530"," a just have a target down below so i'm going to give you two targets for a bear right now"
"9802530","9808190"," okay so we're at a five-minute chart right here right your first target is going to be this red"
"9808190","9814410"," line right here right on a five-minute chart this is your first target right here right here okay"
"9814410","9820030"," first target you're going to switch which switch back to a one-minute chart okay and you don't see"
"9820030","9824930"," anything here there's no targets here you know that that target is right here here's your target on"
"9824930","9830730"," the downside right here right so it doesn't matter now if you're in a one-minute chart or a five "
"9830730","9834510","-minute chart you're going to look at that five-minute chart and you can see it down here you're"
"9834510","9839270"," going to then check the 15-minute chart and you're going to see where in that and you see this"
"9839270","9844430"," one right here right just white line above here so you're going to have a couple different targets"
"9844430","9851730"," here for a week put another one right there right and then you're going to come back to your five"
"9851730","9858590"," or one-minute whatever your trade and now you have some you have some places to look here right i'm"
"9858590","9868520"," going to show you something else back here and just on a policy so"
"9868520","9872020"," i'm going to mute that right there and i just want you to see this is where trend is you"
"9872020","9877500"," just dotted line right here right so i know that if we do have some week this i'm going to"
"9877500","9884580"," be looking for a demand to step back in down here right i want to see if demand come back"
"9884580","9890680"," in or that trend higher into this close right there's your trend heading up so i've got some"
"9890680","9895280"," targets down here to look where the smart money is the smart money down here is the smart money not"
"9895280","9899380"," down there to demand leave we're going to start bloodbathing it into monday people are going to"
"9899380","9905960"," take profit at some point and i'm also going to check the VIX right now and just see what the"
"9905960","9911700"," VIX is telling us where we are right now it's 11 it's at 12 11 and we have we did"
"9911700","9918740"," we failed to get a new high right at 12 o'clock the hourly right now so the ht or"
"9918740","9927460"," not ht the hv the our our leave velocity is now bearish right we started at 12 30 when i"
"9927460","9934280"," look back at 12 excuse me at 11 30 we go back to 11 30 right here and 11 35"
"9934280","9938360"," we failed to get a new high we're right with this bread bar is right here we failed to get"
"9938360","9944920"," a new high we're now at 12 p.m the bears have one half an hour to get down here"
"9944920","9953060"," so from 12 until 12 30 the bears have taken over and they have um 19 minutes to get down"
"9953060","9960500"," here and tag this 409 60 okay they have a half an hour so between now and then it's now"
"9960500","9966240"," 12 12 they've got 13 or they've got three minutes uh in that time frame to get a new low"
"9966240","9971300"," so in the next three minutes i'm going to expect a new low and then by 12 30 i'm going"
"9971300","9979520"," to expect to be down here at 409 40 if they get that if they get that new low and"
"9979520","9984840"," spokesperson today on the authorizing of new vessels for the black sea grain exports just keep have"
"9984840","9993100"," that i've got that going in the back of my head i've got the trade set up right here uh"

"10070870","10076730"," and re-explaining and re-explaining and explaining until your head once well off your shoulders"
"10076730","10082490"," like your message you know what i mean a lot of times you'll go into people's streams and they're"
"10082490","10088370"," like we talked about this seven months ago everybody knows that everybody knows what we do here and"
"10088370","10097430"," you're just like okay buddy all right i was i was impressed i took for the first time in two"

"10127590","10136950"," commitments and manufacturing 470 billion dollars in private sector commitments was it a term of"
"10136950","10145210"," appropriate and and we're bringing back supply chain to the united states i don't ever want to be"
"10145210","10149770"," in a position again we're a major initiative that we have in a major element or economy is"

"10652650","10659970"," would be uh the short selling of regional banks and the third reason would be the employment rate"
"10659970","10666510"," uh we we you know the economic calendar every day these politicians can make statements uh this"
"10666510","10671590"," furthermore the fed in the senate hearings they can make statements that can dump this marketer"

"10746570","10751510"," like video clip memes you could use but the first it was like an end peg and it was probably"
"10751510","10760570"," like a yeah it wasn't even a gig dude it was like there's like 144 bits megabytes 144 megabytes"
"10761150","10766990"," yeah it's like yeah that's what it was we did it wrong it was beyond that's what it was by"
"10766990","10773170"," age i remember all right so yeah if you're out there and you i want you to know if you're"
"10773170","10778710"," a young trainer or a young investor i understand you coming with the key politics out of it uh"
"10778710","10787290"," that's rule from wall street bets comes from a time in wall street bets when uh it got crazy but"
"10787290","10791370"," you'd be in the you'd be in the general discussion and it just it was out of control i used"
"10791370","10796150"," to be a wall street bet member and over the years they would ban this and ban that and ban"
"10796150","10802350"," this and ban that and uh so i'm actually very quite familiar with where that rule came from that"
"10802350","10810190"," rule came from um mixing politics that weren't uh relevant to the market in that discussion thread"
"10810190","10817790"," so they had to do that here we are adults we're traders we're investors we keep it very much um"
"10817790","10823330"," geared towards how it impacts the market if you ever see anybody in the chat that gets out of"
"10823330","10827770"," control even in discord have rules in discord that says you know if you want your own room you can"
"10827770","10832390"," do it like you want to go like stuck off somebody or whatever you can do that in your own"
"10832390","10837290"," private room or something with you and your friends but even in my discord um as long as you keep"
"10837290","10841350"," it related to politics you're good to go we're all adults around here and you should be able to um"
"10841350","10846650"," have you ever seen anybody in the chat that's like uh it goes crazy saying crazy stuff anything"
"10846650","10852930"," racist anything um too out of that's not market relevance to politics say something just be like"
"10852930","10857810"," hey can you mute that guy or give that guy a warning the moderators are already aware of this as"
"10857810","10867670"," well so hope that helps uh so here are the parameters"
"10867670","10873870"," so we had a chat we had a test of the white line right uh we we tested the white"
"10873870","10878910"," line right here we also have biden on right now and whether you i don't know if you know this"
"10878910","10882830"," or not you may not you may know this or may not know this maybe if mary was here he'd"
"10882830","10889490"," tell you about this uh but whenever we have an event like whenever we have a speaker of importance"
"10889490","10896850"," someone that can move the stock market i don't care who it is it's biden it's trump if it's um"
"10896850","10905030"," uh fed president if cash car he's coming out uh you'll if you follow a new squawk they'll tell you"
"10905030","10911370"," who's important uh and so right now biden is important right at this moment if you open up uh"
"10911370","10916310"," financial juice on your own computer at home you'll see that he's front and center right now in"
"10916310","10922970"," financial juice uh he had a video out that says biden meets with his meets with his investing in"
"10922970","10930690"," america cabinet um and they're quoting him right now okay and so what this is telling you is that"
"10930690","10940090"," there are sell side hedge funds right now that are short the market uh due to him speaking okay"
"10940090","10945530"," listen up to this i want you to listen up this if you don't know this there are actual professional"
"10945530","10952790"," traders right now that are shorting this market in case biden drops a bomb that can send this"
"10952790","10959270"," market to the depths of hell in a moment he could say anything you could have uh if biden came"
"10959270","10965330"," out and said just now at this moment uh we're banning uh short selling uh this market can rip right"
"10965330","10972130"," we know that we could get a a ripper move to the upside uh biden said something like we're going"
"10972130","10978310"," to or we're gonna get more bank failures we expect more bank failures we could drop 30 points in a"
"10978310","10983190"," minute uh so whenever these speakers are out they're going to put a hedge on right now and until"
"10983190","10988790"," he's done speaking or he says something positive that hedge will be on the market right now until"
"10988790","10997810"," he's done speaking okay sorry i just wanted to flag disney just broke a hundred yeah disney was"
"10997810","11005410"," looking really good today yeah i just had a a little vertical on it like from yesterday and it just"
"11005410","11011230"," went crazy so i closed it uh that to your point or what we just said so disney just broke"
"11011230","11017770"," a hundred right i want you to know something else if you are a trader the at the spy specifically"
"11017770","11025450"," is being used as a market hedge so you might see like disney go up still but spy not follow"
"11025450","11031430"," and the reason it's not following is because dealers it more so than they ever they say they aren't"
"11031430","11038330"," but they are and uh funds are not they're not shorting futures they're literally buying zero-day"
"11038330","11046930"," puts now there's a rise of zero-day puts on the spy so it's cheap hedging right so it's like"
"11046930","11051410"," oh i'll just move you can actually see it in the options chain uh you can actually see them move"
"11051410","11058190"," in and buy like 200 300 000 puts or like two three pennies 30 cents and the carry on that"
"11058190","11063430"," is dirt cheap for them in case something negative is said it's there's like a rise of this taking"
"11063430","11069250"," place in their markets recently sorry so that's what another reason why we talk about politics here"
"11069250","11075790"," if we were just doing like stock picking um i would probably have on um only stuff that was related"
"11075790","11080670"," to those stocks and not the market at large but because you portrayed the SMB 500 we do have that"
"11080670","11089430"," stuff on sorry all right hold on let's check uh youtube and see what anymore do you guys have any"
"11089430","11099170"," more questions on youtube for winky at this point ask me anything it's friday it's friday"
"11099170","11107170"," it's friday any questions from di from uh any questions uh thank you binky for doing that does"
"11107170","11118920"," anybody have any questions uh inside of uh twitch or youtube uh are"
"11118920","11125320"," the deep in the money options the hedging uh usually yes you'll be able to see as you can see"
"11125320","11133040"," um you'll you actually see them moving in and out in the implied uh implied volatility you can"
"11133040","11137040"," actually see them moving in and out and sometimes in some options change depending upon your your"
"11137040","11143780"," broker you can see them uh they'll hedge the market on both sides and as all some as puts um"
"11143780","11149100"," hedge the market now they do it for a bunch of different reasons too not just uh speakers sometimes"
"11149100","11153320"," it's done for the trades that they're placing to not disrupt the market there's a bunch of"
"11153320","11159400"," different reasons uh we're not going to go over them right now but as a matter of fact i'll look"
"11159400","11162320"," right i'll look right now and see what let me take a look real quick and see what i can"
"11162320","11172000"," see and it's so hard to be patient waiting for these eart plays that i like to do like i"
"11172000","11178420"," know disney is probably going to be one hand after the right next week but like nobody else is on"
"11178420","11188100"," it yet so i i'm just waiting uh yeah yeah i agree i agree the waiting"
"11188100","11195520"," sucks um i i want maybe we can pull somebody in the uh do you guys think that we go"
"11195520","11201980"," so it's friday right uh let's talk about the end of day today into next week give me a sec"

"11210620","11216780"," talked to you about breath this morning and breath is right where right where it was for us to"
"11216780","11226520"," cycle uh to the upside or breath yesterday and the lows right here uh"
"11226520","11231560"," is right where we were last week when we cycled up into the end of the week now on the"
"11231560","11239200"," VIX specifically right they clenched and unclench the VIX and uh there is an argument made by vol"
"11239200","11246160"," traders that'll say like if we're if we go if we're trading down into a friday uh you'll sometimes"
"11246160","11251900"," see like an unclench going to VIX where um the VIX goes down and the market actually goes up right"
"11251900","11257280"," close shorts on a friday wrap it up and then we come back to it again on monday if we"
"11257280","11262220"," were to trade up let's say we traded up monday tuesday wednesday and we're like blasting up into a"
"11262220","11266620"," friday even if we had like a tuesday low tuesday maybe and then wednesday thursday and now we're on"
"11266620","11273220"," coming into a friday you'll see profit taking into a friday right uh that's kind of the same posit"
"11273220","11282020"," here into monday of next week um is you know you have one down day two down day and three"

"11289880","11296500"," big bloodbath from apple and that didn't happen and so you're getting the relief trade on"
"11296500","11304460"," volatility in the market right um into this close so what do i think happens into the end of today"
"11304460","11312140"," um i think we i don't know that we close all this stuff up here it's paul either sideways or"
"11312140","11318140"," up maybe the creepy crawly into this bell uh but i don't see like a bloodbath into the bell today"
"11318140","11324060"," i'm not seeing it uh that we get the bloodbath today into the bell like like hey let's start"
"11324060","11331740"," selling again and there's some stuff for us to look at here and i want this is a 15-minute"
"11331740","11338640"," chart and the important thing to look at here would be we had demand right we had demand at 405"
"11338640","11345920"," and we had demand again at 405 uh so we know that there's demand down here we know that the"
"11345920","11353900"," buyers are still here they haven't given up the buy yet right we know we've got the collar an"
"11353900","11360340"," upside target on the collar and bears really need this to break this 405 uh we also know we"
"11360340","11365740"," yesterday we talked about this trend down here right we're talking about hey we're down here in"
"11365740","11373240"," trend that we stay on trend to higher highs or not um we normally get some some weakness in may"
"11373240","11381980"," a couple a couple we've looked in the past that financials and uh tech we actually get a second"
"11381980","11388840"," tech run in may believe it or not uh but we normally get a couple cells in may um so"
"11388840","11395920"," we so we're in may fifth right now we had a cell um i'm going to expect another another another"
"11395920","11403780"," discount in may uh we're going to go down once more in may but is it a bearish month and"
"11403780","11413720"," the answer is hard to um it's it's a hard one to give um the trend is still up right"
"11413720","11422300"," trend right now is still up right we did break through and get a little week in here i'm going"
"11422300","11428500"," to expect that's we consolidate next week uh to find out if we're going higher we're going to need"
"11428500","11436000"," some support to make a trip higher if we can't find that support we will go lower down here and"
"11436000","11441920"," look for that support later in the month uh if i had to guess if i had to guess just"
"11441920","11451520"," by looking at this uh you know it sets up an inside week right sets up like this it sets"
"11451520","11461520"," up this like decision in here like which way are we going uh and some consolidation and range"
"11461520","11468700"," expansion either to the side or downside uh which way is it is it up do we get told no"
"11468700","11476140"," it's we're going down uh this necessarily here uh we haven't asked that question you see that new"
"11476140","11482780"," high right here at least on this run you look on this run right here right we got a new"
"11482780","11490060"," high 417 up here 62 we're trying to break out on apple when we talked about apple and i was"
"11490060","11494560"," like yeah it's not usually easy to break out so we came down here to try to find the support"
"11495200","11502540"," so you're gonna at least if you're a bear you're next week you're looking for a failure well not"
"11502540","11509660"," just a failure into next week you're looking for a failure right to to not to not even attack the"
"11509660","11514680"," new high so that this this 417 62 you don't even want to see us trade up there you just"
"11514680","11519660"," want to see us start trading down okay and that's going to confirm for bears that we're going down"
"11519660","11529580"," to lower lows that's uh 396 well 400 then 396 and then we'll start talking about"
"11529580","11539340"," breaking larger trend now next week if you see us trade higher and attack this high we"
"11539340","11546800"," could go one tick above and that's bullish we could trade sideways and then find the way up and out"
"11546800","11553520"," over here and that's bullish so next week if you want to know for me what I think happens next"
"11553520","11557960"," week after this week what we just had happened if you're looking for like hey what do I think is"
"11557960","11565420"," going to happen I think that next week is range expansion and more decision you can see it right"
"11565420","11572860"," back here right the coiling of the market coiling of the market and one of these times as we go"
"11572860","11581500"," higher and lower we're going to find out in here if we actually have support or sellers are we so"
"11581500","11589140"," just into next week if you're looking for what to do what's what's to sell and what to buy my"
"11589140","11595380"," positives that were going up here we found support down here I'm looking to target a new high for"
"11595380","11603840"," next week 420 for next week and if you're a bear you're looking to sell any kind of attempt up"
"11603840","11611560"," here you're looking to sell this into next week okay if this dip hadn't been bought down here if"
"11611560","11618100"," apple earnings were dog shit yesterday then I would tell you I would say you're right you're a bear"
"11618100","11624600"," you're right you made it you did it woohoo you did it so the job is on the bulls"
"11624600","11634400"," right now would be this 420 up here"
"11634400","11643120"," 417 this was this this thing up here 416 at least you can get 416 464 1762 and buy trend"
"11643120","11649600"," the whole way up see it right here there's trend this little tagger over here so if we if we"
"11649600","11657120"," get week into Monday if we roll over into Monday I'm looking for a dip buy into Tuesday or"
"11657120","11661340"," Wednesday and then some weakness on Thursday Friday but at least want to see this I want to see at"
"11661340","11669200"," least see this happen how do I know if this this resolution to the upside is is invalid on a"
"11669200","11677900"," one on a one hour right here see this one hour if price goes below if price goes below 408"
"11677900","11687240"," 410 at any points between now and Monday or Tuesday 408 410 this trade higher is over okay this is"
"11687240","11695020"," an hourly trend you'd want to see a reversal here but I am bullish into Monday Tuesday for closing"
"11695020","11702420"," all of this stuff up here I'm bullish at this point into next week for where we are in price"
"11702420","11707640"," okay so I think every dip will be bought I think we're going to go back up and find out"
"11707640","11714740"," if if supply is stronger than demand up there if we get told no we are going to go much"
"11714740","11722980"," not much lower but down at 400 or 396 to find some support so it's between now and Monday here's"
"11722980","11730100"," 408 and 410 right here right I just talked about this 408 410 so at worst I'm expecting a dip"
"11730100","11739840"," to be bought right in here I'm expecting buyers to step in to go back and revisit the previous high"
"11739840","11744880"," i.e. to get the double top or get a new high or have a breakout or any of that"
"11744880","11751940"," kind of stuff if this is broken down here then we will reverse and start to look for much lower"
"11751940","11758620"," lows we're going to instead of that 405 we're looking for 400 at minimum 400 so if you see 410"
"11758620","11765740"," broken it'll be a hundred point move down 408 410 if that gets broken you'll see an 8200 point move"
"11765740","11773320"," down likely to 400 and then maybe the next leg will be 396 if any of you guys disagree with"
"11773320","11794560"," that let me know is there something missing here let me know all"
"11794560","11799680"," right hold on that's the winky what's your take oh you start speaking winky go ahead oh sorry about"
"11799680","11806460"," that i i just think at some point i mean you you're telling people that we got to close at"
"11806460","11812840"," 420 at some point so i mean you just keep taking a swing at you know like what i'm probably"
"11812840","11819940"," going to do is just a vertical like uh there's a may 26 20 23 4 24 25 vertical and"
"11819940","11826920"," it's only a dollar 20 so you know like you sell the 425 because you assume that that's not going"
"11826920","11831680"," to go there and then you buy the 420 because that's what we're targeting and it's not super"
"11831680","11836340"," extensive right now i might buy a couple of those actually so if you see winky if you look on"
"11836340","11841780"," the screen or there i've got the HP down here where my cursor is and the DC so this is"
"11841780","11846140"," the hourly trigger and the daily trigger it's moved right now that i've reset them but you know"
"11846140","11852440"," you're expecting buyers to step in now and i said it was 410 to 408 but let's find out exactly"
"11852440","11858940"," what it is i think it's 407 to 408 so i might be misspeaking right now um yeah i still"
"11858940","11865360"," expect them to at least test that February 2nd high like i've been expecting that for like the last"
"11865360","11870860"," few weeks actually and they've sailed to do that so that's been disappointing but i still think"
"11870860","11877960"," they're going to have to do it at some point so and your your theory gels list what i'm thinking"
"11877960","11884520"," too yeah i like the i like the idea of the i like the idea but i don't like about"
"11884520","11893400"," side so the jpm bear seagull is um 408 26 the jpm bear seagull"
"11893400","11903180"," 6 doesn't care if we trade up or down um but if we're like a magnet if we're heading"
"11903180","11910100"," down towards the middle strike i have faith in us getting there normally so it's not like when"
"11910100","11913500"," we're headed like we're like when they put that trade on if we started heading down there be like"
"11913500","11918860"," yeah we're going there not a dip to go up higher but like we start let's say let's say it's"
"11918860","11926960"," the first beginning of the quarter and we squeeze higher immediately off the off that trade um i'm"
"11926960","11932940"," going to expect us to go down and hit that middle number on the bear seagull if we dip on"
"11932940","11936720"," that trade like a week or two later that we dip i'm expecting we're going to go to the top"
"11936720","11943980"," of that that target first um so but i guess this is all about hedging hedging closing stuff against"
"11943980","11947960"," that trade and the market thinks we're going blah blah blah doesn't matter we're doing right now uh"
"11947960","11953240"," but if we're up here at four four four sixteen four seventeen four twenty and yes i'm like yeah"
"11953240","11958860"," we're kind of fucking close man we get when we when we get close to that number um we're in"
"11958860","11963800"," the first week of may we didn't hit it at the first week of april i'm like yeah i think"
"11963800","11968820"," get up there for just get up there and monetize that shit then they get their free hedging or the"
"11968820","11974220"," downside move then we start making our way down you know what i mean we haven't done it yet so"
"11974220","11981400"," i'm like uh yeah like like i've been saying the last couple days man like he got like he went"
"11981400","11986460"," all the way to 417 but not for 1831 i guess so dumb they'll leave that up there but like"
"11986460","11992520"," i feel like they're gonna try to close that uh too too high and then they're gonna overshoot it by"
"11992520","11998400"," a couple bucks because last time they couldn't get there they couldn't get to 420 so in my heart of"
"11998400","12005220"," hearts i would guess we get somewhere like 421 67 we hit it by the end of two by the"
"12005220","12013100"," end of uh by the end of may we just say that 421 67 end of may dude we hit"
"12013100","12022880"," not financial advice so we hit four ready we hit four uh what do we get to so the"
"12022880","12032540"," last caller we hit 4195.44 on spx and it was their caller was"
"12032540","12040180"," 420 wasn't it 4200 i think was the uh another right i can't remember i think it was 420 dude"
"12040180","12049680"," and they hit they like basically basically hit it and they hit it on february second"
"12051080","12060120"," so like we're we're in march or may fifth so i'm like yeah i'm like does some news break or"
"12060120","12069780"," some squeeze or does like does by now let's let's put together a pear trade then okay so let's"
"12069780","12078220"," assume that the market has a target at 420 or 420 167 whatever give or if i just spilled it's"
"12078220","12087920"," 430 okay so let's just say 430 okay uh so you could express that by buying calls and you could"
"12087920","12094460"," sell kre or you know if if that's the like you got a kind of targeted base on what you're"
"12094460","12102420"," worried about right like so what's the other side of this trade what what could possibly make spy"
"12102420","12110960"," not go to 430 so you just basically do the long side spy short side whatever you think might go"
"12110960","12118960"," wrong in the next three weeks and then uh you're covered on both sides basically and then but you"
"12118960","12126560"," obviously like you hedge or you use like theory or whatever your counter your counter thought is"
"12126560","12132940"," you go super cheap on that like you know what i mean like to head to yourself you don't you"
"12132940","12138960"," don't go like at the money on kre when you buy your puts or whatever i always try to look"
"12138960","12144120"," out in time like i'm doing it right now on stream what i'm like okay so we've got or dune"
"12144120","12150720"," first right we know the debt sale and bullshits there right first week of of september if it was a"
"12150720","12157000"," put spread then i don't really need to care about timing if i was gonna do a put then of"
"12157000","12165060"," course i'd probably make it like a july put but it's called like a june 15th or june 7th and"
"12165060","12174000"," my posit is that we're going to just looking on this chart right here let's uh let's bring this"
"12174000","12183740"," down let's bring this like here and i think we're going to i think that i know that"
"12183740","12191860"," 430s up here so my posit here is that they're gonna sooner than later but they're gonna try to send"
"12191860","12198060"," us up here at least attempt like first week of may or something or even maybe end of may this"
"12198060","12204540"," this is like a magnet right it's not a magnet yet but if we break up here it's gonna be"
"12204540","12213480"," a fucking magnet so um so my my my my posits close yeah i get your thesis or whatever but"
"12213480","12218360"," i my only point was like so what you're actually worried about not happening you can easily head to"
"12218360","12224120"," the other side well i know we've got vol on on the first of june so do i take the"
"12224120","12233840"," long trade for what are calls for 430 uh into june if june 7th maybe 430 c's"
"12234800","12241960"," or something i don't know how cheap those are and then put spread to the downside for a failure"
"12241960","12250400"," that are in the money that expire at like 45 on june seven four cost five hundred eight that makes"
"12250400","12260380"," sense so that's how you have the protection of the economic club of thesis of long thesis fails"
"12260380","12266480"," expected however a q and a with the audience and media and another cool part about this is just on"
"12266480","12274500"," a daily um we're not a daily left for uh here's a this is a four-hour chart for my"
"12274500","12281380"," thesis to be real price on spidey stay above uh price vx stay above four eleven fourteen actually"
"12281380","12289780"," four eleven fourteen or in the one-hour chart truly price needs to stay above uh four tenofot so"
"12289780","12297300"," four eleven or should be four one zero five uh so my thesis is we're going up here uh we're"
"12297300","12303160"," not done going up and we're going to try to retest this previous high uh so some rules if you're"
"12303160","12307660"," at home right now you'd write a rule you're like okay i think we're going up here if we have"
"12307660","12315560"," a failure of this last uh previous high at four fifteen my thesis is jonk after short the market if"
"12315560","12323720"," we fail to close four six four one six six my thesis is garbage if we fail to stay above"
"12323720","12331400"," and i don't mean like a dip i mean like reject and start heading lower uh this is a this"
"12331400","12338460"," he bunks my thesis like this four ten four oh eight this whole area as long as this holds my"
"12338460","12344100"," thesis is still good so maybe i'm just long here and i don't take that short trade unless we break"
"12344100","12349600"," below this gap down here in spx what do you think of that do you think you take both trades"
"12349600","12355740"," same time or you just write the rules and maybe set some alerts um i i started buying into that"
"12355740","12361160"," spread of that vertical i just called out the four twenty four twenty five on uh yeah may twenty"
"12361160","12366800"," eight like i just bought like a few of those i i'm gonna DCA it and see how it goes"
"12366800","12372660"," that that's just like basically how i express those types of trades um probably definitely make"
"12372660","12377800"," more money if you didn't sell the four twenty five against it i mean if it goes four twenty yeah"
"12377800","12382780"," i think that this i think that this area down here this like four oh eight four oh seven if"
"12382780","12389980"," this should holds the bull thesis is alive right now i think until it until price shows below and"
"12389980","12395380"," rejects that uh the bear thesis doesn't play anymore right because the whole point yesterday was"
"12395380","12402780"," the close downside right yeah they close it that was the entire session yeah the entire session was"
"12402780","12408500"," we're double bottoming and it's end of week coming up so yeah like why would they it's almost like"
"12408500","12413880"," the inverse of my last question about the highs of two two like why would they go all the way"
"12413880","12419420"," down there close all those gaps and then just send it back down just orally again immediately"
"12419420","12424600"," because some of this stuff just doesn't make any sense sometimes you have to just look at it like"
"12424600","12430600"," that well then apple uh didn't have a bad year right it didn't yeah apple was fine shake shack was"
"12430600","12439140"," great like even royal karate and crease lines had a good sounding to sit there and watch all the uh"
"12439140","12444880"," regional banks down like twenty five percent while like all these uh some you know like royal"
"12444880","12452840"," Caribbean Caribbean hasn't exactly been a uh former over time banner a banner stock recently yeah"
"12452840","12458600"," all these none of these companies are are going bankrupt none of these companies are failing uh"
"12458600","12464900"," we're not we're not getting that this point right people are working people are creating wealth"
"12464900","12473520"," yeah everything's everything's okay i don't know you know yeah uh yeah so i don't i think that i"
"12473520","12479400"," think apple was a key and not just apple these other reports the same thing this whole season"
"12479400","12486500"," reporting season is not indicating trouble is it at this point i i haven't seen a ton of that i"
"12486500","12493500"," mean there's been some names that have been yeah destroyed but that's because they like uh check or"

"12947390","12956350"," heels in and then like if the facts change or i uh come up to a"
"12956350","12965910"," position or somebody else's thesis that you know kind of invalidates my own then i'm usually pretty"
"12965910","12974470"," like uh pretty unable to change my stance but something i'm working on like i know you and i i'll"
"12974470","12978890"," send you like a ticker and i'll be like i think this thing's awesome and you just kind of ignore"
"12978890","12984610"," it i assume that just means you don't you don't like it like i assume that's what you i assume"
"12984610","12991810"," that's what it means and i'm like okay so i want you to know i shouldn't most of the time"
"12991810","12996210"," i just didn't see you saying something about it or i haven't read it or i haven't responded that's"
"12996210","13001470"," the truth like 80% of the time all right but if i say something that means i do know"
"13001470","13006410"," that you're like can we say something like i know winky's doing this then you know that i'm against"

"13079810","13085830"," like you have to have a thesis you have to have some kind of confidence in your thesis but also"
"13085830","13091610"," somebody comes along and is like that company's going bankrupt next week you gotta be like wow"

"13098270","13105090"," that's probably the biggest lesson that i've learned is just to kind of be anything can happen and"
"13105810","13112350"," that's always true that's a constant like anything in the market can happen yeah like i had i had"
"13112350","13119890"," 10k and AMD calls going into earnings and uh i got out of a lot of it but like uh"

"13153550","13159990"," recheck on this one on this spot there's a one minute chart right now hold up it's a five minute"
"13159990","13167970"," chart you're looking for a retest to confirm the move higher on uh 410 78 should see a liquidation"
"13167970","13171470"," break not guaranteed but you might see liquidation break down here and this would confirm a move"
"13171470","13177950"," higher into the close i am bullish in the close right now um and one of our just get back"
"13177950","13185070"," what's winky saying is uh uh but the goblins on AMD uh dude like i do like the when i"

"13191110","13195730"," we go over things repetitively repetitively repetitively came back from vacation in like first day"
"13195730","13201150"," second day back there are people in chap the first time in two and a half years they're just like"
"13201150","13206490"," they're playing on this bull playing on that uh this is happening that's happening all this"
"13206490","13213050"," different stuff and i'm like it was all like all like not counter alpha like kick ass alpha yeah"
"13213050","13217770"," like people are actually learning from what you're doing yeah that's that's great they're fucking"
"13217770","13224250"," learning and i was just like it was the it made me feel so fucking good in like what you're"
"13224250","13228970"," saying about community and uh part of the reason we started this too like there's there's like a"
"13228970","13234770"," bunch of reasons but one of the other reasons was that um was that a lot of the people that"
"13234770","13240290"," you not the except like i follow this guy's alpha or i want to learn how to day trade from"
"13240290","13246350"," this other guy or whatever but a lot of the um crews out there uh it's always after right there's"
"13246350","13251390"," never like a like you get what they have to say about something but you never get there hey this"
"13251390","13254570"," is my opinion what's going to happen and so i'm like i know i'm never going to have a bunch"
"13254570","13260310"," of followers due to that but i always wanted that as a trader and investor to have like someone say"
"13260310","13265550"," i'm long this uh right now at this moment like yep like i'm not going to name names but there's"
"13265550","13270990"," people out there that will tell you hey i'm long this i entered two days ago and uh it's already"
"13270990","13274490"," up ten percent or something they have a way to get out publicly so they always look like they're"
"13274490","13281270"," winning oh yeah and i lose publicly here right and you lose here publicly on street as well and i"
"13281270","13286810"," want these people to always have our people here to always know that there's wins and losses that"
"13286810","13291430"," you're not fucking perfect i'm not fucking perfect um and we shouldn't ever be held to that"
"13291430","13298770"," standard either um of perfection um uh when we invest in trade and stuff like that like i like the"
"13298770","13304230"," rehab the real being a real investor real trader but there are wins and losses um as you go along"
"13304230","13310370"," that road and so i don't know what we're saying about the community part man is uh oh it's like"
"13310370","13315950"," yeah that's like that's the other side of the trade in a lot of ways you know a lot of"
"13315950","13321030"," times like i'll be like i like walk home and john haggard would be like wait for one oh four"
"13321030","13326070"," and then of course i'm so it's at like 117 and i'm like how the hell is this gonna go"
"13326070","13333010"," to 104 and of course it was like 102 two days ago or something like i added some shares at"
"13333010","13341290"," 102 i was like this damn that dude is like fucking laser laser eyes dude like i didn't even see"

"13346830","13352750"," i wish he went i hope one day he'll show me like what he saw specifically on that chart and"
"13352750","13360290"," told him that that was a price but he closed he closed uh puts yesterday so we were i was"
"13360290","13363130"," like i'm gonna buy some calls but i was bearish into the clothes that i'm like i'm buying some"
"13363130","13369190"," fucking calls here and john he's like i closed my puts man and i'm like uh and of course he"
"13369190","13375190"," did the right thing by closing his puts right he would have gotten fucking torched um so it was uh"
"13375190","13382030"," i don't know i just think the the community aspect to this is like um second and none man like"
"13382030","13386570"," this thing ever fails just uh keep the community is uh it's one of the best communities i've been a"
"13386570","13392190"," part of ramping more than i've seen that i could i don't know what how do you what do you"
"13392190","13399410"," think about our community versus other communities we've been a part of um okay so like i i'm not"
"13399410","13405550"," going to advise you on twitch you know some people would come in and they'd like start trouble and"
"13405550","13413050"," i'd have to like time them out but like it's so like uh it just weeds people out like the"
"13413050","13417930"," community just kind of automatically just you just ignore people like i don't it's almost like"
"13417930","13424110"," magic and uh given that i've been involved in a lot of different twitch streams and like i kind of"
"13424110","13432550"," know how that goes um yeah it's it's probably like the best community like streaming discord"
"13432550","13437550"," community i've ever been involved with like there's you know and like some of the a lot of the"
"13437550","13445210"," trading discord's are actual like locker rooms yeah they'll post like the nastiest like most"
"13445210","13452790"," discriminative whatever you know you can be on either side of like whether you're woke or not or"
"13452790","13457970"," whatever but like you know i i guess it's gross a lot of that there's a"
"13457970","13467330"," lot of that in cool man like"
"13467330","13473230"," i don't i don't have a lot of things that i have to moderate all the time like and that's"
"13473230","13479990"," not an offer for people to like just go bananas but um you know like we all like actually usually"
"13479990","13486050"," when we moderate it's one of your mods clicking on the button accidentally yeah like they click the"
"13486050","13495990"," sword and then everything just turns off it's like well chat's done but yeah man it's"
"13495990","13502090"," it's actually pretty nice you know like think you've got a good community you got a lot of really"
"13502090","13507450"," good people and i you know i feel like it's self-filters people out because you just don't respond"

"13569550","13577730"," right now as long as price right now stays above 41081 i'm bullish we had a price check down here"
"13577730","13583430"," we saw the green box we checked it there's lost right they got their new low and they they lost"
"13583430","13587490"," it we weren't able to complete and get down here to this 408 94 the way is up at this"
"13587490","13594030"," point we're gonna go back up and check the supply above you can see the supply on the book map"
"13594030","13598790"," you can see it above it looks like we're gonna feed into that there are like buyers above it's"
"13598790","13607030"," sellers but they're not by yeah not buyers but uh there are like they're mixing this up but the"
"13607030","13614490"," sellers are above but in reality those are buyers right so price will seek out above"
"13614490","13624170"," yeah i wanted to answer one more question if we have a second bbop on youtube was saying"
"13624170","13633830"," winky i love Larry Williams too someone was asking who he is you're developed this"
"13633830","13639530"," uh i don't know if it's a database or i don't know what he's but he's a database dude he"
"13639530","13648950"," just puts out charts that are like since 1937 every time it's a year ending in two and"
"13648950","13655630"," it's you know the spy or sx does this it means that in December it'll go up a hundred percent"
"13655630","13662690"," like he just comes up with these like uh on this like statistics yeah he's like he'll be like on"
"13662690","13670410"," the 11th trading day of july by ten thousand dollars in spx calls and then sell it the next day"
"13670410","13677410"," it opens positively and like of course if you look at these trades it's like 98 percent of the time"
"13677410","13683830"," it opens higher the next you know it's just and i know a lot of people don't like seasonality and"
"13683830","13690950"," again the whole rich doctor to see the future but there's a reason why those like uh certain things"
"13690950","13696690"," work like 90 percent of the time it's not he's not making it up you can tell if you look"
"13696690","13703270"," at the charts he publishes that like literally the waves you see on the and like the unemployment"
"13703270","13712130"," versus spx it's like exactly we reversely correlated so when he breaks out the uh the uh uh"
"13712130","13718530"," excel charts um oh the excel uh documents and he's like see all these numbers right here he's like"
"13718530","13725390"," i've been writing this shit down since like 1980 yeah all of his training since like because he's"
"13725390","13732810"," like he's legitimately 90 years old yeah like i constantly think to myself he's gonna die and what"
"13732810","13740110"," he better write down all these in roles he's been publishing like no he's seriously like 90 years"
"13740110","13747770"," old dude the data alone is worth insane yeah like his computer is proud of it would be worth so"
"13747770","13753110"," much like wherever he just stores all of his stuff is worth like so much money but yeah like cap"
"13753110","13760850"," will say and he'll produce it like a table basically like if you buy spx on the third day of"
"13760850","13768930"," july then you only gain five percent but if you wait until the sixth day it's 29 percent every time"
"13768930","13774090"," like it's this and then he gives the percentage of that percentage sometimes he's like well 89"
"13774090","13779530"," percent it'll go 29 percent of the time yeah like holy shit dude he's like he's like on this day"
"13779530","13785010"," you'll make 85 percent on this day you'll make possibly 95 percent if you wait two more days but"
"13785010","13794410"," you have a 85 percent chance on the first day you could close him"
"13794410","13802830"," i was like what and you know he's not always right but like that's the like uh it's enough to"
"13802830","13809210"," almost feel like you're cheating something like last year he was all over it's like all those like"
"13809210","13816510"," weird like Fourth of July trades or there was one like going into October where he was like just"

"21067020","21073920"," yeah so no worries brother it's a good question so what I'd recommend to you is the only thing that"
"21073920","21080820"," I can recommend to you is that you'd have to show up week in week out to answer that question"
"21080820","21089740"," I give projections years out in advance I give if this then that"
"21089740","21096780"," I go through macro once a week sometimes every two weeks but normally I go through like big macro"
"21096780","21103200"," stuff why this and why that what will influence this will impact that so just the only"
"21103200","21112700"," recommendation I could give is stick around I'm known for calling the top back in 2020"
"21112700","21121540"," I'm known for calling the top of spy back in 2021 I'm known for saying by the dips down at"
"21121540","21128400"," three forty five and three sixty five like like day long week long rants explaining myself up and"
"21128400","21138250"," down so I'm right in the face so the only thing I could recommend would"
"21138250","21142450"," be just hang out man like do your own thing during the daytime still do what you do whatever works"
"21142450","21147710"," for you right now whenever it's been working for you do what you do I can't address that question"
"21147710","21155710"," right now at this moment because it's a complex question to answer and takes a lot to answer that"
"21155710","21165630"," question it's not one stream either one hour so far we've so far so far if there's ever crap"
"21165630","21173610"," whenever there's like crash whenever there's like crash potential I say something so you won't hear"
"21173610","21179090"," it for me often but what it is there I say something you know it's not like I hide any"
"21179090","21186230"," like if there's a crash like hey we have a chance of crashing or we have a chance for rolling"
"21186230","21191850"," the market over hard and heavy why that is I'll lay it all out for you between a GEX gamma"

"21198110","21207130"," macro stuff yield curves unemployment rate cuts pauses increases"
"21207130","21214910"," if this happens then that happens and I'll be honest with you with conviction you really can't have"
"21214910","21222130"," conviction because there's things that are priced into the market there are there are unknown that"
"21222130","21228730"," things that the banks don't know that institutions don't know that happen along the way but mostly"
"21228730","21234930"," it's it's traded generally speaking it's traded where we think it's where it's gonna go and you"
"21234930","21240990"," don't really need to you don't really need to call it either as a matter of fact we have a"
"21240990","21246910"," we have a longtime friend here right his name is Chase and when we first started it's on the market"
"21246910","21255390"," it was like you know you take you still take profit all along the way like you don't you have"
"21255390","21259550"," to take profit along the way regardless of what you're doing it's a very critical part of being a"
"21259550","21268090"," successful investor or trader or seller is that you take it as it goes you will you you'll be back"
"21268090","21274190"," to work if you don't a lot of times man I got to say this and that's a great what's"
"21274190","21283470"," it's a really good question because being a day trader helps you to not stick to a conviction"
"21283470","21293250"," conviction traders tend to blow up their accounts like you can have a conviction or a hunch and"
"21293250","21302200"," it pays out but generally speaking as an investor as a trader you have to be able to if now"
"21302200","21306900"," I'm not saying you have to be a bull or a bear but you have to know when to get"
"21306900","21312520"," out of the way to regardless so if you're not gonna take a put sometimes they don't take puts I"
"21312520","21317020"," take puts but not as much as I could like if I'm even like so even when I know the"
"21317020","21322400"," markets going down I won't take sometimes I will but sometimes I won't I'm I tend to to go the"
"21322400","21327700"," long side for a bunch of other reasons just for the way that this stuff is built taxes and how"
"21327700","21333300"," I trade better for my own personal self but just like the conviction like it like do you think or"
"21333300","21339320"," you know we're going here or there you will blow yourself up with that I with with real money on"
"21339320","21347220"," the table you will so if tomorrow something happens that says hey we're gonna crash I have no"
