"sfMHzY5-1nI","0","7000"," Thanks for watching, and I'll see you in the next video."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","30000","37000"," ."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","61000","66000"," I do that in my head while I'm watching the actual options chain."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","66000","75000"," I physically watch the options chain as zero dates come in and out of it."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","75000","76000"," Yeah, exactly."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","76000","78000"," So I watch options chain."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","78000","80000"," If you don't watch an options chain, you should start."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","80000","82000"," Watch it for like a month or two."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","82000","84000"," I watch the physical options chain all day long."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","84000","85000"," You have it on all day long."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","85000","87000"," It's all day, every day."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","87000","92000"," And I pay attention to it all day long."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","92000","97000"," If you don't trade spreads, I'm going to tell you to try to figure them out over the weekend or something."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","97000","104000"," Like watch some videos on go to like options industry council or just look up like how to place a put spread or a call spread."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","104000","106000"," Call spread, put spread."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","106000","108000"," And it's a very nice way."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","108000","115000"," It's like it's still risky, but it's not as risky as like owning the underlying market is always better."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","116000","118000"," Like probably the least risky you can do."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","118000","124000"," The least risk in the market is to own something on a bottom that isn't coming fraud."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","124000","134000"," And if you like looking for a safe way to trade like call spreads, put spreads, they're usually pretty nice on highs and lows."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","134000","140000"," I do think we open up strong on Tuesday, but I think we sell it."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","141000","153000"," Get down in there, get all that money in the market, get it all sloshing around, make them make them wait an entire month to get paid."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","153000","154000"," A little bear pulling like water."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","154000","155000"," Yep."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","155000","157000"," If you start to say that that's not so hard, is it?"
"sfMHzY5-1nI","157000","158000"," I'm way easier."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","158000","159000"," I think it's easier."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","159000","163000"," High probability trades, high probability."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","163000","164000"," Yeah, look at that dragon, dude."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","164000","166000"," Full on dragon right there."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","166000","167000"," Look at that."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","167000","170000"," So just if you guys don't know, this is like a famous pattern."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","170000","173000"," So this is a famous pattern right here."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","173000","177000"," And it normally resolves to a pretty big move the upside."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","177000","185000"," Now, if you buy just calls for Monday, if you buy calls for Monday, you're going to wake up and you're going to be not happy."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","185000","188000"," You're going to get you're going to get your entity with data."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","188000","192000"," So that's probably why it looks like this right now."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","192000","193000"," Like, yeah, fuck all those calls on Monday."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","194000","197000"," Look up like a dragon pattern."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","197000","199000"," I think it's called, I think, classically, it's called the dragon."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","199000","201000"," Let me see if you can look it up right now."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","201000","203000"," If you see that on a bigger timeframe."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","203000","204000"," Bye, dude."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","204000","205000"," Bye."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","205000","206000"," Bye."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","206000","207000"," Bye."

"sfMHzY5-1nI","213000","214000"," Bye at all."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","214000","216000"," Dragon pattern, stock pattern."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","216000","218000"," Let's see if anybody even knows this pattern."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","218000","219000"," Yeah."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","219000","220000"," There it is."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","220000","221000"," You want to see it?"
"sfMHzY5-1nI","221000","222000"," We'll get it together."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","222000","223000"," Uh, hold on."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","223000","224000"," We'll get it together."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","224000","225000"," Uh, trigger screen."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","225000","226000"," Uh, dragon strategy."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","226000","227000"," See it right there."
"sfMHzY5-1nI","227000","229000"," This one's lower than the other one, isn't it?"
"sfMHzY5-1nI","229000","231000"," Uh, this one's higher right here, right?"
"sfMHzY5-1nI","231000","232000"," Bam."
