"1600","2100"," Check one two."
"3140","3920"," My check. "
"6180","11560"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"11560","12920"," before the..."
"68140","69980"," Oh shoot, you guys are already here."
"71200","75710"," Good morning everybody."
"77890","79270"," You know, it's like a..."
"79270","80430"," I see you in the chat already. "
"80430","81190"," Good morning everybody."
"81330","82150"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"82610","83950"," I'm starting to see you already."
"86610","88110"," Oh wait, what's going on here?"
"89150","90670"," All right, let's get right into it. "
"92390","93930"," Good morning, baby."
"95550","97890"," Brothers, sisters, family, friends."
"99850","101030"," Merry Christmas. "
"101330","101950"," Happy Hanukkah."
"102350","103470"," Happy Festivists."
"122450","123290"," What else we have again?"
"123430","125990"," We've got other traditions as part of the year as well, right?"
"126830","131210"," I'm assuming that I'm missing a bunch of other holiday celebrating and I'm also assuming that"
"131210","138090"," people from around the world in one way or another as you know, because one way or another as this"
"138090","145650"," holiday is celebrated that even if they don't celebrate, they still have time of pulling back and"
"145650","147870"," relaxing, I guess, to some extent. "
"149070","155510"," If you celebrate something different than Festivists, Christmas or Hanukkah or any of those things,"
"158270","163150"," let me know if he's doing any celebrating or just like do nothing, hang out, wait for the rest of"
"163150","167990"," the world to spin back up in the new year."
"168550","172150"," Maybe it's just time, you know, the other thing too is that it's just marking time for some people,"
"172270","172390"," right?"
"173130","174190"," End of the year kind of stuff."
"175550","177210"," I got to change so a couple things here. "
"177410","184870"," The gamma flip this morning is lower."
"185190","185850"," It's down here."
"190620","193260"," So you get a nice, it's right here. "
"194800","197120"," So that's good news for the bulls, okay?"
"197500","199580"," So you've got the gamma flip is down below this morning."
"199720","200600"," That's very good to see."
"201060","202320"," You're above the gamma flip. "
"202840","207220"," You also have some coiling action in here, right?"
"208060","211500"," And you can see off the open this morning what happened, right?"
"212460","217360"," The vacuum cleaner, like the dealers come out with their algorithms, right?"
"217560","220420"," They have their, and what they do is they're taking everybody stops, right?"
"221500","224340"," Vacating up a bunch of premium resetting prices."
"224840","229900"," Another thing that I didn't, I should have brought this up on Twitter, but I want to say this to"
"229900","237660"," you, there could be some IV crut, not an IV crut premium crush this morning too going on in the"
"237660","238100"," background."
"239120","242120"," If you had, we'll make it simple. "
"242500","250740"," If yesterday you had 100 people holding calls, so we're talking outside of the blast down or"
"250740","252300"," whatever puts calls, I don't care."
"252600","256640"," But think about this as not only we get all these reprisings, right?"
"256760","263420"," But you also get less interest in positioning as well this morning."
"263700","264800"," So think about that too. "
"264960","271040"," There's some some more complex re-pricing and options this morning as well, right?"
"271180","277940"," So you might be taking a position price hasn't changed on whatever, on your favorite ticker spoons,"
"277940","278880"," cues, I don't care."
"279460","281260"," And yet you're directionally right."
"281400","284020"," Yeah, you see here the, the premium's just being bled out. "
"285620","287900"," This is likely a little bit of that going on in here as well."
"288160","292640"," So all this coiling in here, we'll talk about this in a minute, in a minute."
"292760","295540"," But I do want to point your attention to one other important thing. "
"295700","297220"," This is SPX down here, okay?"
"298480","300860"," Let me see if I bring this chart up really quick here."
"311890","312470"," Wait a minute."
"312730","315050"," Okay, so right here, I want to show you this chart right here, okay?"
"315770","321410"," And the one thing I want to draw to your attention here is you see this, this gamma level up"
"321410","321850"," here, right?"
"321990","323490"," The 78 million right here. "
"324830","328270"," You can see this half hour trigger is still coming down."
"330810","332970"," Price is not above the hourly trigger."
"333230","337090"," We know that we want price above the hourly trigger, right?"
"337830","338970"," We want to back test it. "
"339290","343970"," Now the less time we spend here, the greater the chance of a huge squeeze to the upside."
"345470","347830"," But it's usually unsustainable."
"347870","350410"," So we'll get, oftentimes we'll get a back. "
"351070","352970"," Any squeeze that we get will come right back."
"353150","354310"," You can actually see one right here."
"355170","358850"," You can see this half hour trigger acting as resistance, but I point two stands. "
"359370","361810"," What can happen here is even if we are bullish, right?"
"362070","364130"," Let's say we got to squeeze up here next next one, right?"
"364650","367290"," And it's really fast that oftentimes comes straight back down."
"368510","373010"," It needs to confirm this stuff that we're bullish for continuation of the upside."
"373850","375150"," And here's where the danger lies. "
"376710","383270"," And that is, and that is the fact that you could be like, yeah, we're bullish or yeah, we're going"
"383270","383710"," to go up."
"383770","390270"," But what happens is you get trapped and we run back down here and we back test this SPX over"
"390270","390670"," here."
"391910","397930"," So there's some late night last night, I was being asked from some very nice people, but I was"
"397930","400510"," being asked in the very late night last night. "
"400570","408170"," I'm staying awake until quite late trying to see what the action was from London, Japan, all that"
"408170","408830"," kind of stuff."
"409730","412370"," And someone asked someone was like, buy calls tomorrow."
"412430","413830"," And it's a fair question. "
"414630","415530"," Are you saying something?"
"416670","420430"," Or when I was saying to someone, I was talking with someone on on Twitter last night."
"421090","424830"," And it was easy to say, hey, he's saying by calls."
"425110","427730"," And I said positioning for this. "
"428810","431750"," And that I was like, no, I'm not saying by calls."
"431750","439050"," I'm saying you need positioning, you know, and positioning yourself in a trade is one of the most"
"439050","440790"," difficult things to do."
"441110","445170"," You can be correct in direction, but this has to do with timing. "
"445630","447990"," This has to do with where you jump in, right?"
"448230","451630"," And then where you close the mechanics of it are very complex."
"452570","457490"," And a lot of it has to do with what happened yesterday or three days ago or a month ago."
"457970","463050"," And you have to be a hyper aware of all this these mechanics to position yourself properly. "
"463510","473230"," It's not something that's taught easily, but something that takes mentorship, takes creating it not"
"473230","473650"," live."
"474530","477510"," It takes time to understand positioning."
"477850","479270"," Positioning is a very complex subject. "
"479270","480490"," It's very dynamic."
"481150","486230"," And you have to be aware of all these landmines trying to position yourself."
"486630","491610"," And then if you're mispositioned, or if your thesis is wrong, are you staying in the position?"
"491910","492950"," Are you adding to your position?"
"493070","496770"," Are you cutting your losses and repositioning?"
"497310","501190"," So it's a very very complex subject. "
"501410","509910"," And so anyways, to that point, positioning matters if you are bullish."
"511270","514409"," And right down here, I want you to look down here in the SSPX."
"514690","520190"," See this, see this previous low from yesterday, right in cash market, it would not shock me for a"
"520190","520710"," minute, right?"
"520909","523110"," You get squeezed up here, come straight back down. "
"523250","525650"," Let's do a violent up here, right?"
"526030","528070"," But you come straight back down."
"528330","530890"," And that was the actual dip buy right there."
"531670","532170"," Okay. "
"532710","540350"," So the prudent thing for a bull here, even if you get left behind and we leave, would be to"
"540350","544050"," wait and look for this back check on SPX."
"544430","549330"," Now, saying that we have rules around here, right?"
"550110","555050"," If we're, if price is above the one in five minute trigger, we're bullish, right?"
"555410","556010"," We're bullish here."
"556910","561910"," Personally, I want to see one of two things happen. "
"562590","568530"," Either we roll down here, I don't care what any of this is, we roll down here and bounce and"
"568530","569790"," immediately do the V shape recovery."
"570110","571510"," We're often running, we close that gap."
"571670","580670"," We're good to go or or I want to see price squeeze up above the half hour and hourly trigger. "
"581150","582470"," I don't care where it goes."
"583190","583870"," I really don't."
"583970","585970"," So I really care about that back check here. "
"586810","589470"," So if price comes back and back checks, right?"
"589650","592210"," It gives the time for the one in the five minute trigger to come up."
"592870","598610"," You have the momentum of the half hour and hourly trigger on your side."
"599830","605770"," And all I worry about at this point is that we beat this previous high. "
"607110","614850"," Comes back down again, and I'm off and running the probability of me having a winning trade and"
"614850","624750"," being positioned properly begins to increase it in a big way, like 30% chance, 40 "
"624750","629310","% chance, 75, 80, 90% chance of me making money."
"630410","634350"," Now, some guy would be like, yeah, I bought calls back here and we immediately went to the moon."
"634750","640810"," You know, that guy might have won that trade or that girl might have won that trade one time out"
"640810","643430"," of 10, maybe even three times out of 10. "
"644010","646410"," But I'm not trying to win three times out of 10."
"646770","652570"," I'm trying to win seven times out of 10, believe it or not, nine times out of 10."
"652950","657870"," You might think that's impossible, but it's not if you follow the tools that we teach you here. "
"658610","665450"," I promise you, you can win, win, win, and you know if you lose where to cut, right?"
"666270","668610"," Where your thesis is wrong and where to reposition."
"669270","674710"," If you follow the tools that we teach you here, you will become more and more profitable as time"
"674710","675210"," goes on."
"675630","681730"," And these rules matter or work on every time frame, one minute, five minute, one day, one week. "
"682610","687570"," So it doesn't matter if you're a swing training, doesn't matter if you're, I don't know, trading"
"687570","688950"," leaps, believe it or not."
"690610","693330"," You can use this on a weekly chart, believe it or not."
"693830","700510"," So apply these concepts, these tools that we teach you on every time frame. "
"702390","708070"," Another idea here or with it alongside this is if you know all of this information here, right, and"
"708070","710450"," you say, well, fuck it, I want to put risk on here."
"710810","713270"," Fuck coming back here, Cap, right?"
"713430","716410"," But you put that risk on it and the trade does go against you."
"716890","724370"," You at least know if it goes against you where you're heading, heading back down here to revisit"
"724370","725050"," that, right?"
"725810","733450"," So you can manage your trade, even if you are wrong, you can trade just these movements, right?"
"734630","739130"," You can be long here, you can get some puts in there, some calls or whatever you're doing, right?"
"739130","749050"," You're long short on futures, but you're tactful the entire way up and you know where the counter"
"750110","752330"," trade is against your thesis. "
"752990","755190"," This works for bulls and bears."
"756850","759250"," And we're going to go over, we're going to review, it's end of the year."
"759410","766350"," So we're going to today probably spend some time at some point because in the past week or so, I"
"766350","770790"," haven't done as much work on this stuff with you guys in stream, but we we do this every day"
"770790","771430"," for a year. "
"771770","776250"," We've done this over 200 times this year together."
"776250","781430"," We've streamed together this year, believe it or not, I'll try to show you that stuff that the what"
"781430","787230"," we did this year, but you know, we've done this 220 times together this year live."
"788470","797670"," You've had you've literally had a live education or primer or whatever you call it, just repetitive "
"797670","798150","ness. "
"798550","802410"," You've been here in the stream for a year, you've been able to sit with me for a full year"
"802410","811030"," and just re hammer these same concepts into your brains over and over and over and over again,"
"811330","813010"," because these tools work consistently."
"814850","816030"," So we'll do some of that today."
"816210","819310"," This is actually a good example of what to do today as well. "
"820250","822970"," And anyway, your gamma flip line is lower, okay?"
"823830","826950"," I've got the cues up with triggers for you today."
"827450","828990"," There's a bunch of coiling going on."
"829130","829810"," You see that, right?"
"830190","832570"," You saw the open, they're trying to ping pong us in here. "
"833090","835290"," My thesis is that we're going up."
"835850","840070"," Okay, but there is risk to the back on the backside down here."
"840490","846470"," So you're either going to be or it was me, I'd be looking for buying this right here, or I'd"
"846470","852110"," be trying to buy a successful back test of this stuff to go higher over here, okay?"
"852530","857650"," Those are the two most highly probable and profitable trades you can take. "
"857850","862250"," Now, if you're a bear, you're a bear, right?"
"863410","870310"," And you want to see this market burn, you need to be below the previous high down here, okay?"
"870770","874670"," And you need to start, you don't care about any of this stuff if you're a seller."
"874950","876450"," None of this you care about."
"877070","880910"," You want to be a badass bear, you want to be a great seller, you want to be a winner"
"880910","885790"," as a seller, you don't care about any of this action, you don't need any of this action, you need"
"885790","888150"," to get underneath that previous low. "
"888410","889050"," Very simple, right?"
"889810","890430"," Barely simple."
"891850","896050"," You're a doom bear if you're a crash bear, if you're just a seller, you automatically know you need"
"896050","898270"," to get underneath the gamma flip."
"898910","904310"," You know you need to get underneath the previous low and we can start, and you start rejecting one,"
"904970","906330"," two, right?"
"907030","910090"," You're then entering here, right?"
"910270","912630"," You've got, and you've got all your stuff already done for you. "
"912730","914030"," You know you beat the previous low."
"914430","915790"," You know you're underneath the gamma flip."
"916150","918690"," You already know that there's no buyers here, right?"
"918990","921070"," Weak buyers here, right?"
"921410","922950"," And that's your trade to the downside. "
"923530","924130"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"924770","928150"," That's your trade as a seller right there to go down."
"929430","934450"," So, bears, you're just sitting here waiting, you ain't doing shit until you see all of this take"
"934450","936350"," place for you to take us downtown."
"937150","940650"," Outside of that, you're waiting for these bulls here. "
"941070","944330"," You don't want these bulls, like these bulls come in, they buy some calls, right?"
"944550","949310"," They blast up, they're like, woo, making all this money gets turned around in these bulls."
"949570","951210"," They're like, oh god, everything's burning, it's terrible."
"951730","954090"," I hate Christmas, I hate Hanukkah, right?"
"954710","957310"," But then these bulls get greedy again, and they do what?"
"957550","959970"," They step right back in and buy that up again on you. "
"960830","965650"," And meanwhile, you're a bear up here like trying to fuck around here, trying to fuck around here,"
"965970","971510"," chasing all that price over there, when you could just sat in your hands and wait for the break"
"971510","980710"," lower and a trade that literally prints, if you wait for it, what, seven times out of 10?"
"981430","982570"," When that happens, okay?"
"983050","984830"," So, don't get caught up in this if you're a seller."
"987030","990550"," Now, in regards to the, here we're going to switch back over really quick."
"991370","1000550"," In regards to mainstream, in regards to the caller, I was asked yesterday about the caller, hey, do"
"1000550","1003950"," you think that we can hit 45-15?"
"1004550","1005670"," Well, first let's start at the beginning. "
"1006190","1010150"," I want you all to be aware of the caller, regardless of where we go."
"1010450","1012150"," Your market awareness is key."
"1012670","1018570"," You guys out there, I see people out there just destroying very intelligent people. "
"1019070","1021350"," You got like Andy Constant getting banged up."
"1021610","1024490"," You got people making fun of Jim, right?"
"1024609","1026410"," You got people that make fun of all kinds of people."
"1026690","1030650"," You got a short seller ST getting smacked around sometimes. "
"1030930","1032710"," You got me getting smacked around sometimes."
"1033329","1035670"," You got help getting smacked around sometimes."
"1036030","1038790"," I'll be honest with you guys, you want that information. "
"1039310","1039890"," You're a retailer."
"1040310","1046170"," You've got people that are dedicated and very intelligent putting out information to you."
"1046630","1051090"," You as a trader and investor need to have market awareness for all possibilities. "
"1052390","1055390"," And these people are out there reminding you day in, day out."
"1055710","1057450"," Doesn't matter if it goes that way."
"1057730","1059910"," Doesn't go that way if they're right or they're wrong. "
"1060650","1070450"," You are being blessed on fintuit with a cadre of old men and women that"
"1070450","1076770"," are telling you where everything is like information that you need to be aware of."
"1076990","1080290"," Can you imagine if you didn't have that information in front of you?"
"1081550","1082530"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"1082790","1086510"," So take a scoop all that stuff up, have all that stuff in the back of your mind so that"
"1086510","1093990"," when you're placing a trade and it goes against you, you have that knowledge on a speed rolladex"
"1093990","1095770"," for lack of a better word."
"1098090","1099570"," David, what's going on, brother?"
"1101170","1102390"," Everything's going great, man. "
"1102710","1103510"," Good morning, my man."
"1103770","1104430"," Good to see you."
"1107780","1108760"," Everything is awesome, bro. "
"1109900","1113820"," So the idea here, you know, these people are putting this information out for you."
"1113820","1114880"," Just take the information."
"1115320","1116840"," If you don't like it, don't agree with it. "
"1117880","1120200"," It's okay, but you are reading it."
"1120320","1122200"," You are consuming it, right?"
"1123000","1125860"," Now the JPM caller, we're going to talk about that."
"1126240","1132720"," The impact of the magnets of it into the end of the year is not as important, okay?"
"1133380","1140100"," But the one thing for me that grinds my gears is, the one thing that grinds my gears here is"
"1140100","1142000"," that sentiment. "
"1143060","1146900"," We trade to sentiment oftentimes."
"1147540","1153160"," We trade to places of interest, regardless of what we think about that interest."
"1153500","1159660"," We can break through that interest, but if you've got a portion of the market that trades, I don't"
"1159660","1168420"," know, expanding megaphones or bull flags or bear flags, regardless if they prove themselves, people"
"1168420","1169900"," will trade to those things. "
"1170440","1174560"," You've got people out there that trade Elliott wave so that you know if you're looking at Elliott"
"1174560","1181220"," wave targets up or down, you know that when we come into those support and resistances, there will"
"1181220","1182600"," be some interest there."
"1183280","1192800"," So as this applies to the JPM caller, if people say, or let's say yesterday, let's say yesterday,"
"1194980","1198840"," right, he had interest in the JPM caller once again."
"1199740","1209560"," So if sentiment is 45, 15 is looming, that truthfully with with a low volume market, right,"
"1210100","1219340"," end of the year, low liquidity, we can trample there just based upon people saying, Oh, that 4515"
"1219340","1220320"," or go in there. "
"1220420","1221520"," Does that make sense?"
"1221520","1223500"," Literally, especially in this time of year."
"1224040","1229640"," So that is still on the table for some extent, and it would be more, more sentiment or awareness"
"1229640","1231960"," driven if we do go there."
"1235620","1236620"," Thanks, go boy. "
"1242390","1243470"," More than all of you."
"1243890","1245010"," David, good to see you brother."
"1246830","1247650"," I'm serious. "
"1247990","1252990"," Like yesterday, I was walking around and finned to it and I was watching people calling people out"
"1252990","1253690"," on finned to it."
"1253850","1254290"," You're wrong."
"1254490","1254910"," You were right. "
"1255030","1255450"," You're wrong."
"1255470","1255970"," You're right."
"1256390","1257910"," Mostly you were wrong, right?"
"1258250","1260570"," And they don't need to be right. "
"1261230","1263410"," They really don't and they need to make you aware."
"1263650","1263970"," That's it."
"1264030","1265150"," They don't even need to do that. "
"1265150","1267690"," They're doing it on their own kindness of their own heart."
"1268470","1269850"," Just be aware of that when you're out there."
"1273610","1274330"," Just be aware. "
"1275890","1277650"," Anyways, all right, rant's over."
"1278450","1282970"," So you know about SPX gamma is now lower, okay?"
"1283330","1286250"," You know about the previous closing low down here."
"1286730","1288410"," David AMS in the stream this morning. "
"1288530","1294410"," I bet you he's got his eyes all over the NASDAQ closed from cash market closed from yesterday."
"1294990","1298510"," I bet you we could ask him is I guarantee he's looking at that."
"1300510","1304530"," Traders are traders want to see these extremes back here. "
"1304630","1308050"," They want to see like we go come back down here and take a peek at that or no."
"1308710","1311170"," We break through these extremes down here."
"1311290","1312910"," Points of interest, right?"
"1318930","1319730"," Hey, David. "
"1320630","1321870"," Happy holidays, brother."
"1322210","1323170"," I'm going to give you a shout, man."
"1327150","1327810"," All right. "
"1328050","1332910"," So I'm going to so these levels here are not today's levels."
"1333070","1340200"," I'm going to put those levels on the chart for you right now for spoos."
"1353800","1355140"," We're going to do these together. "
"1357100","1358220"," Here's your pivot."
"1360040","1363920"," 476 on an intraday basis."
"1364940","1369160"," This is your position, your bearish indicator, okay?"
"1369320","1370280"," This is your pivot point. "
"1371980","1374360"," Take close attention to it."
"1374520","1375260"," Hold on a second, guys."
"1378180","1385340"," First resistance is at 473.50. What can we gauge from that?"
"1389720","1391280"," Range expansion, right?"
"1395920","1403200"," If you wake up in the morning and you get your if you could wake up in the morning, you"
"1403200","1405940"," see these support and resistance levels are tight. "
"1406640","1409160"," We know that we have some contraction in price, right?"
"1409360","1412800"," We start to see support and resistance levels expand."
"1413120","1416560"," We know that we're expecting some range expansion, right?"
"1417660","1419300"," So here's, oh, here we go."
"1419400","1420520"," Here's our one right there. "
"1422500","1423740"," We want a quick second here."
"1427260","1432340"," There's 473.50. Wait till you see this."
"1432340","1434040"," It's going to get wild here in just a minute. "
"1434180","1434740"," Hold on here."
"1441850","1445910"," Then we have 47873."
"1449550","1451850"," Look at this range expansion here. "
"1460380","1461400"," Here's our two."
"1462220","1464800"," Let's look at where that range expansion is."
"1464940","1465620"," Look at that right there. "
"1466200","1468840"," Coiling tight, break above our one and where we going."
"1469460","1470420"," To the moon, right?"
"1471800","1473220"," Then we have 48157."
"1473220","1482900"," And that's 55 but close enough. "
"1483040","1484800"," We'll talk about STXL up here later."
"1520640","1524860"," They have programs that you can set your levels every day."
"1525100","1527800"," I personally try to set my own every day. "
"1563620","1565060"," Watch where your S1 is."
"1566280","1567480"," Wait out here."
"1569720","1570760"," Look at that. "
"1571020","1571660"," That's S1."
"1572100","1573220"," Wait down there."
"1577060","1580940"," Support level one is below the gamma flip down here, right?"
"1581820","1584300"," Bad, bad news down here, right?"
"1584860","1587320"," Don't want to see any of that break down of the pivot. "
"1587780","1590500"," Don't want to see any of this like blood bath down here."
"1590740","1593060"," Break down below the previous low from yesterday."
"1594700","1596040"," Don't want to see that, right?"
"1596420","1598720"," Start rejecting this stuff and start heading lower. "
"1599380","1601040"," Here's the previous low from yesterday, right?"
"1601040","1602840"," So we're going to snap that line in there."
"1602920","1609260"," That's an important one right there."
"1622300","1624220"," That's that previous low from yesterday. "
"1624220","1626160"," We're right here on spy, okay?"
"1642820","1648140"," When you come to trade every day at home, you should be doing this stuff every morning you wake up"
"1648140","1651880"," and you know where all these pivots are, right?"
"1651920","1655140"," You should be knowing where all the big pivots are, the little pivots, all the stuff."
"1656120","1660720"," Previous low gamma flip pivot, bullish above, bearish below."
"1661840","1664280"," S1 we've got way down here, right?"
"1664700","1665620"," That's range expansion. "
"1729530","1731890"," Daily trigger down here."
"1735710","1737090"," This is your collar."
"1737370","1738410"," We start breaking down. "
"1738870","1740510"," We're going down to the collar down here."
"1757900","1759760"," Price in the middle here, right?"
"1759960","1761360"," This is what the goat usually says."
"1761440","1763180"," Don't get caught in the middle. "
"1763860","1765700"," Don't be diddling in the middle, right?"
"1765960","1767280"," Diddling, diddling, diddling."
"1767700","1768360"," What are you looking for?"
"1768880","1769980"," The break to the upside."
"1771000","1772720"," The break to the downside, right?"
"1773560","1774900"," Not messing around in here. "
"1813850","1815070"," Let's go to the home."
"1820450","1822990"," So you guys can see how I do this every day."
"1823590","1825450"," Or at least what's going on in my brain. "
"1829870","1834190"," I don't normally do this stuff anymore, but I should do this for you more often."
"1838480","1839540"," Right in there, right?"
"1839980","1840600"," Ping pong, right?"
"1840780","1847020"," Ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, right?"
"1847860","1848260"," You see that?"
"1848440","1849780"," Ping pong, ping pong, ping pong."
"1854900","1859460"," A little robot sitting there wanting to clean all of this up. "
"1861560","1863200"," What do we have back over here?"
"1863300","1864460"," We got this one right here, right?"
"1864580","1866100"," You see that little nod right there?"
"1866220","1866940"," That's your R1."
"1867320","1868420"," We got that one targeted."
"1869220","1870820"," What do we got going on up here?"
"1872700","1875540"," We got another one right right there. "
"1878740","1880720"," Another little bad boy right up there."
"1880880","1886790"," We got another this one right here."
"1886890","1888290"," This is the beauty right here. "
"1888570","1891010"," That little sexy bad boy right up in there."
"1891830","1892790"," You can do this at home."
"1892950","1895190"," I know some of you already do this and know about this. "
"1898690","1899930"," Pretty easy, right?"
"1900830","1902550"," Look at all that volatility here."
"1903190","1904990"," This is what we think is support down here."
"1905950","1907810"," A lot of work to be done in here, isn't there?"
"1908710","1909430"," Swing up there. "
"1910010","1910970"," Come back down there."
"1911150","1911790"," Come back up here."
"1911890","1912510"," Come back up there. "
"1912590","1913870"," Believe it or not, that could happen."
"1914250","1915310"," That is an outcome."
"1948410","1949370"," It really is. "
"1949970","1958530"," I'm telling you, you don't have to believe me here, but there's a seek and destroy and just eat up"
"1958530","1959510"," your options here."
"1975040","1978020"," So, now that I charted that out for you, right?"
"1978300","1979240"," Let me ask you a question."
"1980100","1981900"," Let me ask you a serious question. "
"1982500","1988940"," So, before we even opened this morning, right, went on Twitter and I said, sit on your hands,"
"1988940","1989340"," right?"
"1989620","1990060"," Do nothing."
"1991840","2000520"," You should be able to in your mind visualize all of this before you ever come to the market."
"2001360","2003000"," You should be able to vision in your brain. "
"2003220","2006980"," You should be seeing all this and saying, all right, what do I need to know coming to this open"
"2006980","2007520"," this morning?"
"2007940","2009140"," So, this opens specifically."
"2010860","2012300"," What would you do in this open?"
"2012300","2013420"," You'd say, you know what I'm going to do?"
"2013520","2014680"," I'm going to let this market breathe."
"2015700","2018160"," I'm going to let this market figure out what it wants to do. "
"2018280","2023660"," This is like a theta gang's part on for lack of a better word in here, right?"
"2025440","2028460"," You want to see all of this get worked out, right?"
"2028680","2034500"," You want to see all this get worked out for a bigger direction up there, bigger direction down"
"2034500","2034880"," there."
"2035720","2040840"," So, all this stuff in here, if you if you're at home without me sitting here, right?"
"2040960","2041820"," You'd be like, you know what I'm going to do?"
"2042020","2043140"," I'm just going to hang out here."
"2044380","2048739"," I'm going to watch them take all these robots, like this, I call them like the gremlins, like"
"2048739","2050960"," little robots coming in just taking all this stuff out. "
"2052780","2055440"," So, that's where that comes from this morning."
"2056440","2057520"," Don't even have to chart it."
"2057580","2061920"," Just already know that this range expansion on the options chain already know that this pivot's up"
"2061920","2064360"," and down and that they're close, right?"
"2064540","2066699"," As we opened, they were really tight and close. "
"2077780","2080739"," Every time we take one of these out, we'll delete them too."
"2081460","2083719"," So, if we come out, let's see, come out here, we take this out."
"2084420","2085880"," We'll just delete that one right there. "
"2086040","2087199"," Now, we know about the one above it."
"2094760","2098020"," Yeah, what's right, Karula says, what dream did theta gang get hard?"
"2099160","2103980"," That's why they're not going to do it."
"2105780","2108500"," There is a trade here too. "
"2109040","2114880"," There is actually a trade here, a high probability trade to the up or down side."
"2115180","2120460"," Whenever it presents itself, you'll always have people that'll say, I want you to know this too."
"2120600","2124880"," You're always going to have a voice out there saying, even if you, I don't care if you got 10"
"2124880","2126260"," followers on Fintuit. "
"2126640","2132720"," You're always going to have someone pop in and tell you something like, uh, oh, bro, I took that"
"2132720","2139960"," trade, you know, like, um, here, you're going to have people out there that are going to be like"
"2139960","2140220"," this."
"2142360","2146500"," Say this thing, moons, right?"
"2146820","2149520"," They're going to be like, bro, I bought that bottom tick right there, bro."
"2150060","2151120"," I'm better than you. "
"2151640","2153360"," Tell you what, that guy will disappear."
"2154260","2156200"," Had it gone this way, they just disappear."
"2157280","2159360"," You focus on you making money. "
"2159940","2166560"," You learn the tools that you need to learn so that you don't care about internet cred, that you"
"2166560","2172320"," care about making money and all costs that you make money, that you have high probability setups"
"2172320","2174000"," that you make money."
"2174240","2177700"," Don't care what other people are doing care what you are, what you are doing."
"2178840","2186360"," Get your tools on, get your, you're like your base knowledge on so that you are mostly a successful"
"2186360","2187100"," trader. "
"2199500","2200940"," How do I find gamma lines?"
"2201540","2206380"," I go to, uh, I go to the CVOE every morning."
"2207120","2213080"," You can take it all day long, but the best time of day to pull gamma levels is, um, right"
"2213080","2215260"," around, uh, 9 a.m. 8 30."
"2215520","2220820"," I prefer 9 30 to be honest with you as, um, depending on the time of day, the data can"
"2220820","2223420"," be really, uh, washed out from zero dates. "
"2223700","2224780"," I shouldn't say 9 30."
"2224920","2229880"," So before the cash market open, um, before the zero dates enter the market, you can get a clean"
"2229880","2232160"," read, but at the end of the day, the read sucks."
"2232880","2236140"," Now that data is free for SPX. "
"2236360","2236620"," Okay."
"2237680","2244640"," Uh, they provide it in a file for you to download to an Excel, uh, document that you can download."
"2245360","2251860"," You write a bunch of equations in that Excel document with a pivot chart, a pivot table, excuse me,"
"2252080","2259520"," you then take that pivot table data and you write yourself a Python script and you can display that"
"2259520","2259800"," data. "
"2260160","2261120"," It's a good question."
"2261480","2266900"," Let me answer that better for you because the guy that taught me how to do that is a really"
"2266900","2267560"," cool guy."
"2267960","2271740"," He's not on, uh, he just came back on, uh, Twitter recently. "
"2272500","2275320"," He had taken some time off to create a training program."
"2277300","2280160"," And I'm going to give you guys, you guys want to do this on your own?"
"2280380","2283700"," I'm going to, I'm going to give you guys a guy that I really do truly appreciate."
"2287150","2288490"," His name is perfillive. "
"2292010","2292930"," You want to do that?"
"2293030","2293770"," You want to get your own gamma?"
"2294110","2298790"," You don't want to be relying upon, well, I shouldn't say relying upon, I want to say this too."
"2299130","2305930"," Um, well, as I do this, I want to say this because I don't want to disparage, um, tier one"
"2305930","2306250"," alpha."
"2306570","2307850"," I don't want to disparage spot gamma. "
"2308390","2310950"," You know, there's a, it doesn't matter real."
"2311090","2311350"," It's true."
"2311470","2312370"," I want to tell you guys something. "
"2312610","2312790"," Okay."
"2312930","2315230"," I want, I want to tell you guys something very important here."
"2318430","2320290"," You can do your own gamma stuff. "
"2322880","2325400"," But when you get your gamma from spot gamma, right?"
"2325900","2328720"," It's, it's what they're doing with it that makes it important."
"2329220","2329540"," Okay."
"2330020","2334080"," So the spot gamma guys, if you like them, that's why you go to them. "
"2334500","2335560"," You got to tear one alpha."
"2336040","2338140"," There's a reason you go to them for their gamma."
"2338140","2338900"," What do they do?"
"2339040","2340360"," And what do you like about them, right?"
"2341180","2342580"," Is this it fit your needs?"
"2343780","2349180"," So I just gave you a link right now to, uh, I just gave you a link right now to"

"3802890","3803430"," It's okay. "
"3803910","3809890"," Vicks on the rise still or metrics that that we track and that directly relate to your revenue"
"3809890","3810190"," growth."
"3810190","3810850"," What are you seeing?"
"3811570","3812470"," You know, it's funny."
"3812650","3817230"," We block the calls coming in right now for 72 C or 72 C."
"3817450","3824150"," What we've seen every single quarter throughout 2023 is people have been spending a consistently"
"3824150","3827350"," high level on board quarter over quarter. "
"3827530","3829890"," It's the same amount that they were spending last year at this time."
"3830190","3831810"," So we haven't been again, baby."
"3832010","3834110"," We're projecting moderate increase. "
"3834490","3835150"," We lose the stream."
"3835290","3835850"," Okay."
"3836130","3838970"," In 2024 versus an incredibly strong there. "
"3839390","3846290"," 2023 and that's a testament to the experiences that our brands offer and people being happy to pay"
"3846290","3850410"," for the experiences that our team delivers on board and it's across the board."
"3850490","3856230"," It's bar, it's casino, it's shore excursions, specialty diamond red on, you know, I read you just"
"3856230","3858410"," say vacations and seamless looks good."
"3858410","3858710"," Okay. "
"3858950","3859270"," To strength."
"3859890","3864150"," Josh, really interesting question about age cohorts, right?"
"3864270","3865450"," You look at marketing at the industry."
"3865450","3869890"," It's all about energetic vacations and the commercials are full of young people on slides. "
"3870230","3876410"," But a lot of drugs are leveraging bombs inside the chat right now and people over the age of 65,"
"3877110","3880430"," at least in this country, is the median age going up or down?"
"3881390","3882850"," That's a brand by brand question."
"3883250","3888450"," We have a portfolio of world class brands and they are speaking to different target audiences,"
"3888450","3890070"," which include different age brackets."
"3890670","3896510"," So we've got a brand like Holland America, which is absolutely advertising and speaking to an age"
"3896510","3901230"," base that is significantly older than you'd be speaking to if you were a carnival cruise line,"
"3901370","3906450"," which is going for that younger family set or folks that are maybe just out of school looking for"
"3906450","3908730"," an efficient way to have an amazing time. "
"3909150","3910890"," And we will absolutely leverage that."
"3910990","3916430"," As you said, that is an incredibly wealthy part of our population here in this country."
"3916650","3921050"," They have time and money and that's what you need when you have a brand like Holland America that"
"3921050","3928530"," can deliver cruises that are 14 nights, 21 nights, world cruises of 110 days and we speak directly"
"3928530","3929150"," to them. "
"3929150","3933090"," Yeah, that is no reason to go back to work on Monday."
"3933630","3938670"," The other question I have is about oil and I know industries hedge all the time, but is the"
"3938670","3945290"," thinking that the non-opec supply of crude around the world is going to lead to a more dovish"
"3945290","3947390"," backdrop when it comes to fuel?"
"3948830","3950770"," Your guess is as good as mine."
"3951210","3952110"," We don't hedge. "
"3952710","3953930"," We focus on consumption."
"3955050","3956490"," It's fairly maniacal."
"3956590","3960570"," We want to see reduced consumption on a unit basis year after year after year. "
"3961010","3968730"," This year, we expect to be 19% lower in unit consumption of fuel just versus 2019."
"3969490","3973030"," We actually peaked in 2011 in absolute fuel usage."
"3973030","3980810"," We peaked in 2011 and we're 10% lower forecasted for 2024 even though we're 30% bigger because"
"3980810","3984710"," there's one constant which is if you use less, it will cost you less. "
"3985270","3986350"," That's where our focus is."
"3987090","3989110"," We were just talking about during the break, Josh."
"3989510","3994410"," What a comeback and it's not just you, Royal Caribbean, also one of the best performing stocks of"
"3994410","3995930"," the year for this industry. "
"3996130","4002410"," The industry that was the poster child of the COVID spread where people remember, who had to stay"
"4002410","4007770"," in their ships, where people unfortunately were dying early in the COVID crisis as a result of"
"4007770","4012750"," getting COVID on these ships and just what a transformation it has been."
"4013230","4020850"," Was it that investors or folks you talked to did not think that the demand would fully come back"
"4020850","4024950"," after that just because of all the publicity and those bad stories?"
"4026670","4029730"," I think early days of the pandemic, there was a lot of unknown."
"4030050","4034790"," There was a lot of poster child for a lot of things and we learned very quickly having been paused"
"4034790","4038010"," for most of a year to a year and a half. "
"4038490","4041530"," Cruises were not the cause or a spreader of COVID."
"4042010","4046990"," We got past that quickly and when we came back, what was really great was it was our loyal guests"
"4046990","4048310"," that started the trend."
"4048770","4054510"," They could not wait to get back on board and as we've recovered and now we're back to even better"
"4054510","4058090"," than recovery, what we see is it's not the brand repeaters. "
"4058110","4060090"," It's not the loyalists that are driving us forward."
"4060310","4065810"," They're consistent, which is amazing, but what is really encouraging is our growth in first timers."
"4066390","4070250"," New to cruise, new to brand, that is propelling our growth and that says a lot. "
"4070410","4074350"," That says that people are looking for the experiences that we have to offer."
"4074410","4080250"," We're a tremendous value to land-based alternatives, too good of a value and we can lean into that."
"4080470","4084630"," We can raise pricing and still be a great value and that's what people are looking for and I think"
"4084630","4089650"," our brands are doing an amazing job of speaking to their guests and target guests and generating"
"4089650","4090250"," that demand. "
"4090790","4097229"," If times are so good Josh, how come we don't hear more about capacity coming online, new orders for"
"4097229","4099850"," new boats, three, five, ten years out?"
"4100590","4101609"," Yeah, that's a great question."
"4101970","4105189"," What we've done is we've been patient."
"4106569","4111770"," We've only got three ships this year, which for us when you look historically is not very much. "
"4111950","4117050"," We've got one in 25 and then we have nothing thereafter that would have said publicly and I will"
"4117050","4119430"," continue to say as we will order ships again."
"4120050","4126069"," I'd be shocked if we weren't ordering a ship or two in 2024, but that won't be for delivery many"
"4126069","4129090"," years out and will be one to two a year, moderate growth."
"4129810","4134649"," I think that's the right cadence for us and I just focus on us, not the industry and I think"
"4134649","4139950"," we have a big opportunity over the next few years with that lower growth rate to really focus on"
"4139950","4148630"," improving same store sales and keep leaning into that and the demand from that will generate more"
"4148630","4152810"," revenue and better impact to the bottom line and I'm looking forward to achieving that. "
"4152970","4154810"," I was going to say the profitability is key too."
"4154990","4159470"," You're still operating at a loss Josh and that's been one of your priorities, right?"
"4159670","4160910"," So how's the progress?"
"4161670","4167029"," So I'm happy to say we actually ended fiscal year 2023 with positive income."
"4167510","4169729"," So that's a big turning point for us as a company. "
"4169950","4170890"," We are a seasonal business."
"4170890","4174370"," So the first quarter is never going to be the rock star for us."
"4174370","4180490"," We make a vast majority of the money in Q3 and we expect to be nicely profitable next year. "
"4180689","4186109"," We're expecting you margins to be around 30%, which means we still have a way to go to get back"
"4186109","4190810"," to pre-pause levels, but I'm confident that we'll get there and we set out our three-year targets"
"4190810","4193650"," that will certainly get us there by 2026."
"4194450","4195070"," What a year."
"4195450","4196210"," It's been for you, Josh. "
"4196390","4198490"," Thank you very much for coming on and talking us through it."
"4198850","4199710"," Thank you very much."
"4199710","4200170"," Have a good day. "
"4200390","4201750"," Josh Weinstein, CEO of Carnival."
"4201810","4202330"," You too."
"4203370","4207570"," Still to come this morning, CEO of Tanger Outlets on the strength of the consumer, plus any"
"4207570","4212230"," potential supply chain disruptions that we may see from the conflict in the Red Sea. "
"4212390","4212830"," We'll be right back."
"4218700","4251980"," Look at"
"4258800","4259060"," that."
"4260580","4262420"," Just grind, dude. "
"4262780","4263160"," Grind."
"4269560","4271260"," First time here."
"4278330","4281420"," Floyd garage just dropping hammers right now. "
"4287370","4289550"," Floyd garage is inside YouTube."
"4294640","4297140"," Uh, Kax Ton core PLCC."
"4297520","4298780"," I don't know if that's him or not. "
"4300420","4301660"," Someone saying that is him."
"4301820","4304940"," I'm not sure if it's him or not."
"4311400","4312120"," I'm into you. "
"4312220","4313140"," That's hilarious, dude."
"4319020","4323500"," Willie Loeman gets down and just said, I like the idea of somebody seeing the big movie yesterday"
"4323500","4324920"," and being like, you know what?"
"4325120","4326920"," I think I want to try this trade and thing."
"4347340","4348980"," What else do I see here in the background?"
"4349160","4350140"," I'm not seeing too much. "
"4353930","4356930"," Go through, uh, see me find some stuff for you guys here."
"4357110","4357790"," Hang tight one second."
"4400810","4401390"," Welcome back. "
"4401530","4402490"," Let's get to the retail sector."
"4402690","4406870"," Amid the last week of this holiday shopping season, our next guest says, despite shoppers starting"
"4406870","4409530"," earlier than ever, traffic has remained pretty strong."
"4409590","4410490"," Oh, it is him. "
"4410690","4413610"," I expect a surge beginning Saturday, joining us here at post nine this morning."
"4413610","4414190"," Oh, dude."
"4414490","4415030"," He is Brian. "
"4415270","4415850"," It is Brian."
"4416250","4416730"," Welcome back."
"4416810","4417430"," It's great to have you. "
"4417530","4418210"," Thanks for having me back."
"4418270","4421870"," We're so grateful because your traffic radar is so granular."
"4422370","4423530"," How does it look at this moment?"
"4424210","4430170"," Well, right now, I think traffic has been pretty strong, particularly going into December and the"
"4430170","4434890"," weather patterns through the end of holiday shopping season are going to be strong. "
"4435190","4436870"," You know, holiday shopping doesn't just end on Christmas."
"4437570","4443090"," You know, it's that week after Christmas that up to New Year's, which we think just extends the"
"4443090","4444830"," opportunity for customers to come out."
"4445110","4445790"," It's not just returns. "
"4446230","4446710"," It's more shopping."
"4446990","4447530"," We don't say returns."
"4447830","4452470"," We say exchanges, changes, changes, changes gives the retailers the opportunity to take something"
"4452470","4455730"," that comes back and trade the customer up and sell them more things. "
"4456070","4458350"," But it also brings a lot of cars back into our parking lot."
"4458470","4459650"," And there's also big gift card business."
"4460350","4463530"," So gift card redemption is very strong the week following Christmas. "
"4464070","4464990"," But how is traffic?"
"4465850","4466370"," It's good."
"4466590","4469430"," How is it relative to say last year or the prior year?"
"4470430","4475670"," Fortunately, so we talked about the fact that November, the beginning of November was really where"
"4475670","4477390"," the holidays selling season started."
"4478050","4481990"," You know, we said that right after our Halloween programming comes down in our shopping centers,"
"4482350","4483290"," the lights go up. "
"4483290","4484090"," So that is."
"4484090","4486290"," Those up Christmas trees and music changes."
"4486790","4491110"," And the customer responds to that and they started shopping very early this season and they"
"4491110","4492790"," continue to shop through December. "
"4493530","4497810"," So our numbers from both November and December from the traffic point of view are up from last"
"4497810","4498070"," year."
"4498550","4501990"," What do you think drives in 10 once we cross into 24?"
"4502650","4503430"," How do people?"
"4503850","4505030"," So just heads up here."
"4505230","4506750"," What do you guys do me a solid out there?"
"4506750","4508590"," Okay, January, February, normally track. "
"4508950","4509270"," Hold on here."
"4509270","4510790"," The reason to think this year might be different."
"4511110","4511530"," Better or worse. "
"4512230","4513510"," One quick second here."
"4515210","4516390"," Can you guys post?"
"4516830","4518370"," Can you guys repost that?"
"4518490","4519650"," What do you guys do me a solid here?"
"4519810","4519930"," Okay."
"4522530","4523310"," What do you got?"
"4523490","4527750"," Can somebody post the link to his YouTube page in the chat?"
"4529810","4530990"," Do me a solid?"
"4531190","4532890"," How many people are watching this show right now?"
"4535250","4536330"," Do me a solid. "
"4536490","4539510"," I want you if you guys are on fintuit, you guys might do me a solid."
"4539650","4542950"," Can you follow this guy right here?"
"4543230","4546330"," A-C-A-X-T-O-N-C-O-R-P-L-L-C."
"4550510","4553190"," And then I want you to seek out his YouTube channel. "
"4554850","4555490"," Crip tonight."
"4555710","4556130"," What's up, brother?"
"4557470","4560030"," Do yourselves a solid out there?"
"4560110","4561370"," I want you guys to know something, okay?"
"4562150","4566370"," If you guys aren't following this guy, you need to follow him."
"4566570","4568070"," I can't express that anymore. "
"4568530","4572810"," If you guys are ever in my show or whatever and you see him pop his show on, just get"
"4572810","4574330"," out of my show and go watch this guy."
"4574910","4576090"," Especially if you're young."
"4576310","4578630"," You're a young trainer, young investor, any of that kind of stuff. "
"4578810","4582690"," This guy is going to teach you the ways of not getting absolutely fucking blasted."
"4595240","4596060"," Thanks, Stimpy."
"4600920","4605580"," Yeah dude, if he does the Christmas special, if he does the Christmas special, right?"
"4607420","4610380"," Let me know because I'll just shut the stream down here. "
"4610600","4612820"," We'll go watch this stream."
"4615560","4616800"," I'm totally down."
"4618080","4623440"," Oh yeah, there's his YouTube page right there. "
"4624720","4629980"," I want you to subscribe to his YouTube page as well and put his put alerts on for him."
"4630840","4632080"," There's his YouTube page."
"4632440","4638260"," Subscribe to him, click, you know, like alert or whatever so that whatever he's streaming, you"
"4638260","4639220"," watch him. "
"4646880","4652420"," I think what he's done is, I think what he's done is he's changed his handle in the past too."
"4653780","4658560"," He's a very contrasting guy, but I like that about him."
"4658600","4663440"," The guy doesn't, whether you like what he says or not, the guy speaks on what's on his mind. "
"4666100","4667380"," Yeah, subscribe to him."
"4667500","4667840"," Trust me."
"4670740","4671660"," Thank you later. "
"4695340","4699360"," We think the spreads are usually 10 to 20 percent better in an outlet channel."
"4699600","4702500"," We're seeing that that break across our portfolio."
"4703160","4704880"," So should there be excess inventory?"
"4705180","4708260"," Obviously we're the excess inventory goes. "
"4708380","4709000"," Yeah, I'm seeing it."
"4709000","4710080"," Mr. Talkin' monkey too."
"4710200","4710920"," Driven by newness. "
"4711380","4713000"," They always want to bring the new product in."
"4713140","4714940"," They always want to have the latest and greatest in those stores."
"4715620","4717920"," Our customer is looking for their favorite branded value. "
"4718180","4721160"," So when that product comes to us, we still have a customer for it."
"4721460","4724280"," And that's why a lot of brands are coming into the outlet channel because they think the customer"
"4724280","4727020"," there, they may not get in their full price."
"4727640","4731980"," And so if they can acquire a new customer bringing their products into our channel, we get to do a"
"4731980","4732780"," lot of business with them. "
"4732920","4733620"," And so do the brands."
"4734320","4738540"," I'm curious finally, how you think about market selection, you know, post-COVID we've talked a lot"
"4738540","4743200"," about across suburban areas growing, areas in the South, as people left urban centers."
"4743500","4746560"," Is that trend stabilized, accelerating, reversing?"
"4746800","4750780"," Chris DeMarco out there saying the rotation back to big caps starting to coil up. "
"4751040","4754460"," Healthy consolidation at highs and time for the holidays and families."
"4754620","4755520"," Back to the cities yet."
"4755920","4761740"," We haven't seen people going back to work five days a week, like they might in some other"
"4761740","4762260"," geographies. "
"4762260","4765000"," We're seeing that in Europe, but not necessarily seeing that here in the States."
"4765600","4770940"," So a lot of those tertiary markets, secondary markets, Huntsville, Alabama, an unbelievable market"
"4770940","4776000"," that's on everybody's radar from a retail point of view is a great market for a for a brand like"
"4776000","4777860"," ours to go ahead and extend into."
"4778360","4779240"," Pretty fascinating. "
"4779240","4783300"," Look, obviously we're the time of year where the consumers everything right now."
"4783500","4784080"," Steven, thanks."
"4784480","4784880"," Good to see you. "
"4784900","4785660"," Thanks for having me back."
"4785660","4787260"," Good year in the market too."
"4787600","4793480"," After the break, an open AI rival founded by former executives looking to raise a new round at a"
"4793480","4796880"," valuation more than three times its valuation just in the spring. "
"4797500","4799300"," The details when money movers return."
"4877660","4879060"," Well, did I just lose my stream?"
"4879600","4883840"," I think I just lost my stream there for a minute."
"4888450","4891110"," Yeah, I think I just lost my stream for a brief moment there. "
"4904080","4905560"," John, I think that's him, man."
"4905680","4908740"," If you go out, hey, that post I made John, he said it was him."
"4910880","4911740"," Follow my cursor. "
"4912320","4912980"," I know, dude."
"4913320","4913900"," Follow my cursor."
"4918540","4919180"," Stream's okay. "
"4919380","4919580"," All right."
"4919900","4921200"," I do fucking love that shit."
"4922680","4923080"," Steam. "
"4923560","4923660"," Okay."
"4930040","4930840"," Jeremy Hofstadter."
"4930960","4932400"," Hey, Kathy taught us a lesson yesterday. "
"4932640","4934520"," I believe needs to be emphasized when the market was dumping."
"4934760","4935420"," You didn't trade at all."
"4935580","4937340"," No catching bottoms or catching a falling knife. "
"4937740","4938400"," Thank you."
"4938700","4940120"," I appreciate that, Jeremy."
"4943400","4944560"," Thanks, Lord Pentey. "
"4951380","4952320"," Hey, Hagerty."
"4952480","4953100"," He's out there, man."
"4953380","4954860"," He's so Hagerty get in there. "
"4955420","4958420"," It looks like a binky was talking to him."
"4959280","4960560"," So you want to get in there and shout."
"4960800","4962980"," I asked him if he was going to do his Christmas special. "
"4963500","4964420"," I thought it'd be fucking cool."
"4964580","4965100"," You know we could do?"
"4965600","4970040"," Shut the fucking stream down and send everybody over to his channel."
"4971020","4972820"," While he does his Christmas special. "
"4972820","4973780"," I think that should be awesome."
"4973960","4976380"," Like fucking just all of us head over there and just hang out with him."
"5001440","5002240"," No, Bork. "
"5002380","5003300"," I don't think no, Bork."
"5003440","5004160"," He's not on Twitch."
"5006020","5006660"," Just YouTube. "
"5006980","5008700"," If he was on Twitch, dude, we could do a raid."
"5009460","5010640"," Ask him if he wants us."
"5010860","5012380"," I guess we should ask him first. "
"5012580","5014280"," He might not want everybody heading over there."
"5014400","5016680"," His main competitors and talks to John Hagerty."
"5016780","5017900"," I caught those knives for calf. "
"5018140","5020300"," He shows no signs of cooling."
"5020800","5022540"," Dude, Dubosa has details in today's tech check."
"5022740","5023080"," Morning, D."
"5024580","5025560"," Yeah, yeah, Bork. "
"5025740","5026280"," I agree, dude."
"5026420","5026760"," For sure."
"5026940","5029800"," As the word she is now, anthropic is the other gender. "
"5030020","5033400"," If he was if he was on Twitch, man, we could just head right over to his channel."
"5033400","5036060"," Wanted to build a safer AI startup."
"5036260","5039160"," They have also raised a ton of very Christmas to you, too, Joe. "
"5039440","5043000"," But it differs from open AI in that anthropic is all right, Bork."
"5043160","5044080"," I'll take a look right now, brother."
"5044180","5049780"," Like a Microsoft, but several including Amazon and Google sometimes within the span of just a few"
"5049780","5050060"," weeks. "
"5050580","5054820"," Now, a source with direct knowledge tells me that anthropic is looking to raise again."
"5055040","5061100"," This time, $750 million led by Menlo Ventures, a round that would be John H."
"5061320","5064940"," If he does that Christmas special, let me know and the stream here, brother."
"5065080","5065600"," We'll go over there. "
"5065900","5068840"," It's led by a traditional VC and Menlo Ventures."
"5069320","5073600"," And it's less than a billion dollars, meaning that this isn't essentially the cloud computing"
"5073600","5079580"," deals, which have largely been the funding story for generative AI startups over the last year."
"5080020","5083280"," They need billions of dollars in compute power to build their model. "
"5083560","5085500"," So mega caps with their huge piles."
"5085760","5088800"," They provide the capital and the compute power in return."
"5089000","5094580"," They get a lot of that money back in cloud revenue, plus the upside, if valuations rise, and"
"5094580","5097360"," valuations are indeed rising at a remarkable rate. "
"5097540","5100620"," We have shown this chart before and we will keep going back to it."
"5100620","5103240"," It shows the sales multiple for AI beneficiaries."
"5103360","5105900"," At the top, you have open AI and anthropic. "
"5106120","5106820"," They're still private."
"5107160","5113980"," So we use reported revenue numbers and valuations below them, way below them, are the public mega"
"5113980","5114400"," caps."
"5114700","5119580"," Some of the most expensive companies out there, their sales multiple combined doesn't even come"
"5119580","5123040"," close to those of the pure gen AI plays at the top. "
"5123280","5128060"," Now, we have done a few tech check weekly deep dives on valuations and funding in this virtuous"
"5128580","5130320"," cycle and the generative AI space."
"5130560","5136100"," I'm going to spend some time here going over some people that have become members."

"5178840","5179580"," I love you, H bomb."
"5180220","5182400"," I appreciate you being here since day one, my brother. "
"5183020","5184680"," Are we hands off today?"
"5185740","5188660"," At the moment, I'm not seeing anything."
"5189440","5193980"," If you want to take a look anywhere around the market, we can look at we can do individual tickers."
"5193980","5195820"," So how about this, H bomb?"
"5196740","5203560"," If the market continues to pin, we'll switch over and maybe we'll start charting out maybe five or"
"5203560","5206120"," 10 tickers for the stream. "
"5206420","5215280"," Maybe Bork can set something up and get maybe five ticker requests from Twitch and five ticker"
"5215280","5216760"," requests from YouTube, possibly."
"5218100","5221120"," Maybe we can get through these tickers for people."
"5221280","5227160"," Make sure though, if you're requesting a ticker, make sure that it's not something that runs with"
"5227160","5227680"," the market. "
"5228160","5234140"," Your ticker looks like it runs with, I don't know, spy cues, any of that kind of stuff."
"5234400","5235600"," I don't want to do those tickers."
"5236660","5239760"," I want to do do not or are not trading with the market. "
"5240620","5242580"," Matter of fact, we'll start with one right now."
"5248580","5253220"," Gee dad, gold, resubscribing for 10 months in a row."
"5255440","5261000"," Green man, 1984, resubscribed for eight months in a row. "
"5262220","5266740"," Bubble dine, resubscribing for nine months in a row."
"5267600","5271240"," Bullshit, resubscribing for 10 months in a row."
"5272140","5276280"," Dye bang, resubscribing for 10 months in a row. "
"5277180","5281580"," Joey Donut, resubscribing for nine, eight months in a row."
"5285680","5288700"," Carly, what's going on out there?"
"5289120","5295780"," So the US 30-year fixed rate mortgage is at 6.67% December 21st week, which is down from"
"5295780","5298140"," 6.95% to the prior week."
"5300300","5301680"," Jesus, that is loud. "
"5305020","5309020"," They got financial juice needs to work on their levels today and their volume levels."
"5311580","5318620"," That's like the first bar."
"5331180","5332560"," We'll reveal that in a moment. "
"5332840","5337500"," When you look at the market, where I said we are bouncing back to the last day, late yesterday,"
"5338460","5339040"," everything's green now."
"5339180","5342500"," We do have the 10-year at 3.85% just talked about that."
"5343160","5343480"," I want to go right now. "
"5343560","5346220"," CNBC is saying everything's green right now is the market rolls."
"5346840","5350260"," And you're at the top end of where the street is."
"5350740","5354600"," 50-100, got some company up there, some strategies that have set that number. "
"5355060","5355960"," What is that sound reason?"
"5356120","5356680"," We want a quick second."
"5356860","5359740"," I got a ticker that I was watching for a few days now."
"5359940","5360300"," Hold on a second. "
"5360300","5363080"," Actually, it has everything to do with earnings growth, right?"
"5363220","5367980"," The analyst estimates right now are that we're going to get 12% growth year over year next year, as"
"5367980","5369100"," well as the following year."
"5369340","5371400"," And our methodology is really kind of simple."
"5371420","5376000"," I mean, it takes the 20-25 earnings, it attaches a multiple that we have some subjectivity. "
"5376000","5377200"," Let's look at two tickers."
"5377560","5381200"," We do a bull base and a bear scenario and we wait them."
"5381340","5382060"," Here's the takeaway. "
"5382060","5382800"," Yeah."
"5383340","5389440"," We give you the bull, the bear case, and the sideways markets that were never wrong."
"5390700","5391700"," Hold on one second here. "
"5392520","5393860"," First, we're going to look at here."
"5394060","5400300"," I was in, I think it was, forget, Muppet trades created a new discord."
"5401640","5411340"," So I made a post about a ticker called E-N-V-X, E-N-V-X, posted a chart"
"5411340","5411820"," on it. "
"5415930","5418950"," In that discord, he was asking for people too."
"5420230","5421910"," Many guys are in that discord."
"5423290","5425950"," This is what the chart was that I posted right here. "
"5427470","5433670"," E-N-V-X, someone inside the stream said we might not get the chance to buy a dip, where"
"5433670","5434990"," it wants to buy a dip."
"5435750","5440510"," I still think the dip buy is down here, 1277."
"5440930","5442350"," We're still not down there yet. "
"5443630","5445770"," You guys can always check that chart out."
"5445890","5446330"," It's out there."
"5446390","5451610"," It's out and about floating around, but I really do want to see price continue down here. "
"5452690","5455850"," Touch it and V-shape straight up."
"5456650","5463630"," Now, if we don't do that here, we start to break above 13.93. It's possible we leave it behind."
"5464350","5465490"," Keep it on your radar. "
"5465930","5469790"," This is a nice 30-minute chart here on E-N-V-X."
"5470670","5472110"," They've got great fundamentals."
"5473610","5479670"," I like the accumulation and distribution of this ticker, and I also like this right here. "
"5480810","5485570"," If you look at this right here, this is a very similar setup back here."
"5485830","5487110"," Get the big squeeze up."
"5487590","5488610"," You get the big cross. "
"5489630","5491410"," You got the check back over here."
"5492250","5492850"," Nice little squeeze."
"5493530","5498210"," A little bit of rope-a-dope down here, but we're off and running to the upside, putting some time"
"5498210","5499550"," on a trade. "
"5500150","5501970"," Let's take a look at that part of that trade right there."
"5502150","5506090"," This is April, and this is all the way into August, right?"
"5506470","5507590"," Multi-month trade."
"5508590","5512210"," Just starting to build itself out over here, right?"
"5512470","5514430"," Multi-month trade to the upside. "
"5515130","5516830"," E-N-V-X."
"5518430","5520270"," Next one we're going to look at."
"5523040","5524200"," R-G-F. "
"5525680","5532800"," Now, this is the one that I was saying was not trading with the market yesterday."
"5533740","5536880"," So, what did this ticker do yesterday?"
"5536900","5539200"," It actually went up yesterday."
"5541020","5546880"," We discussed this ticker on Twitter two, three days ago, right?"
"5547220","5548020"," And it was right here. "
"5548160","5548580"," Remember that?"
"5548840","5549340"," It was right here."
"5551460","5553460"," Why did we discuss this ticker?"
"5566100","5575960"," IPO within three years makes real stuff, makes freezer food, healthy freezer food, right?"
"5576540","5579860"," They sold this IPO, levels of this IPO at 12 bucks, right?"
"5580320","5582780"," 13 bucks sold into all these people."
"5582780","5586800"," They got trashed all the way down here watching new accumulation. "
"5587900","5594480"," We're at the end of the year, tax loss harvesting, looking for the January effect, and"
"5594480","5604320"," maybe if they could be a contender here for an M "
"5604320","5604620","&A."
"5605220","5609980"," It doesn't matter if they get the M&A or not, matters that they're there, right?"
"5610200","5612140"," They're also below a trading below two bucks."
"5612940","5617260"," So, you know that they're going to go on some type of probation heading into January. "
"5617900","5619380"," They do this shit for a quarter."
"5619640","5620860"," They're going to have to bring it back up, right?"
"5621060","5621760"," Pump it back up."
"5622660","5624200"," Price target on this ticker. "
"5624840","5626660"," Did not sell off at the market yesterday."
"5627760","5629500"," Looking for a dollar, 76."
"5630260","5637540"," For me personally, I want to hold this into some time into Q1 and see if we can get all"
"5637540","5639800"," the way up to this $3 here. "
"5640920","5643760"," And I'd really like to see six bucks."
"5645280","5655180"," And I'd really like to see $4.95 and maybe even $6.80, $6.60 if there was"
"5655180","5657320"," a merger and an acquisition."
"5657880","5662240"," So, this is me positioning down here just so I can see what happens at this ticker. "
"5662920","5666460"," I would say a couple of things about this ticker, which would be first."
"5666960","5668300"," Make sure you check their fundamentals."
"5668960","5670740"," So, they're not just a pump and dump scam company. "
"5671260","5672360"," I like this down here."
"5672520","5677800"," I've got declining velocity, declining negative velocity and the daily trigger on this ticker."
"5677900","5678960"," It's all looking good to me. "
"5679880","5687480"," There's no options being traded on this right?"
"5687740","5689180"," I like the stock."
"5691040","5692640"," But I think it's a buy and hold."
"5692840","5696540"," I think it's something I hold on to for the next two, three months, see how it performs. "
"5698160","5699340"," But I like this ticker."
"5699340","5699940"," I like it a lot."
"5700080","5701540"," It's got a lot going for it. "
"5701540","5706260"," I like the fact that the owner is down here buying as every son has big volume down here."
"5706440","5710300"," So, RGF, the real good food company."
"5712140","5715660"," I like that it didn't trade with the market yesterday as well. "
"5731340","5735240"," So, there's two tickers for me that I've got my eyes on right now."
"5751580","5753980"," Here's your gamma flip right here, right?"
"5754860","5756360"," So, just spy gamma flip."
"5758080","5764820"," Remember when I asked you this morning on Fintuit, I said to you, have we gone back and retested"
"5764820","5767600"," the prior low from yesterday that's down here. "
"5769380","5770760"," Talked about positioning."
"5789570","5791930"," There's a gamma flip target right down here."
"5791950","5793650"," It's a little red mark right down there. "
"5801400","5803000"," Prior low right over there."
"5834260","5836680"," Take a look at PX, P-A-Y-X."
"5838060","5839560"," All right, let me write some of this down, Bork. "
"5839720","5840220"," I got you, brother."
"5844780","5846420"," Appreciate it, Bork, for giving us some tickers."
"5849120","5850560"," Let me write those down, man. "
"5850640","5850860"," Hold on."
"5886550","5888750"," Talked about doing a split trade."
"5889610","5891530"," Put sand calls were very cheap. "
"5912300","5914680"," Options master, good to see you in the house, brother."
"5932990","5942310"," US 30-year rate mortgages, 6.67% versus December 21st, 6.95% for our percent, the prior week."
"5943010","5949870"," Which in the two years, I got you, I got you. "
"5949970","5953050"," But still, it's hard to ignore what's happened recently."
"5953830","5955530"," That's why I want to have this conversation."
"5956050","5965410"," Because what you just did, Josh, proved that you need to have a much wider lens into how you would"
"5965410","5968130"," view a particular stock's move. "
"5968390","5969330"," And I love that."
"5969330","5970930"," And I want to expand it."
"5971750","5978690"," Blackstone's up 39% since November 1st, Salesforce 32, Schwab 31, Sherwin 29, American Express 26. "
"5979370","5980850"," You don't have to go through every single one of them."
"5981850","5985590"," But give me the psyche behind the way you're thinking about them as a group."
"5986070","5988630"," Time to trim, time to buy. "
"5989230","5989530"," What do you think?"
"5989830","5993990"," Yeah, so there's really a couple of themes going on here."
"5993990","5997510"," And with that group, financials, it's a big factor."
"5997950","6000310"," So Blackstone, Schwab, American Express. "
"6000890","6006670"," They are all stocks that underperformed massively this year until recently."
"6007390","6012930"," Because interest rates were going higher and nobody wanted a bank or anything like the financial"
"6012930","6013510"," institution."
"6013810","6019330"," And since we've had the pivot quote from the Fedder actually before that, these stocks have all"
"6019330","6019890"," retired. "
"6020230","6021520"," Okay, so there's the financial theme."
"6021860","6028100"," Then you've got the soft landing theme, which is about industrials and about housing and about"
"6028100","6029360"," mortgage rates coming down."
"6029820","6032600"," And that plays into Sherwin and Salesforce. "
"6032780","6039560"," So I think everybody's hot names recently have reflected something about financials and soft"
"6039560","6039820"," landing."
"6040240","6046480"," Do we think those are the names to trim less likely to trim most of those, the financials, then the"
"6046480","6050980"," ones that have had these big moves where they were already strong this year."
"6051620","6054180"," So that's where you have to like, for example, Salesforce. "
"6054480","6060360"," Yeah, what's crazy is that we've narrowed these down to five per person."
"6060720","6062320"," There were like 10 names on this list."
"6062340","6066840"," If not more that were up substantially with these kinds of returns. "
"6066880","6070820"," We're like, well, we don't have time to do all of them, but it gives you an idea of what"
"6070820","6071820"," some of these stocks have done."
"6072520","6073600"," Bill Baruch, I jumped to you."
"6074460","6076000"," Uber's up 41%. "
"6076000","6081500"," These are all again, reminder November 1st to now Morgan Stanley speaking of financials up 30% Bank"
"6081500","6082540"," of America up 26."
"6083600","6087020"," If via 26 IQ, what is that?"
"6087480","6092260"," Target up 25 health sciences right down there, baby, right down there."
"6092860","6097480"," That's what I want to buy right there, right there is a little by that bad boy right there to"
"6097480","6103460"," their health care, financials and actually utilities got started to perform in year two as the"
"6103460","6105400"," great start to come down in that environment. "
"6105880","6110640"," So Morgan Stanley, I think their prime position, wealth management, deal making, Bank of America,"
"6111040","6113260"," the net interest income is something that's going to start turning."
"6113400","6115000"," I think for them, they're going to be a leader there."
"6115480","6117980"," As rates come down, I do think we'll see the steepening yield curve. "
"6118840","6121060"," When you go to an Uber, I mean, there was obviously a headline with Uber."
"6121260","6122280"," It's going to join the S&P."
"6122620","6124140"," I think of Uber as an industrial company. "
"6124320","6125480"," I mean, everything they have across the board."
"6125880","6128340"," I mean, they're making deals with everything."
"6128620","6129580"," I mean, we own Domino's pizza. "
"6129800","6130100"," It's up huge."
"6130100","6134160"," And Domino's pizza is going to start rolling out all of their franchises on Uber Eats."
"6134480","6136760"," So I think Uber is sort of sharp corner this year. "
"6136880","6138180"," It's just a big story in itself."
"6138400","6139800"," You look at any of these names on your list."
"6139820","6141200"," All right, let's look at some takers here. "
"6143480","6145280"," Let's look at some takers."
"6145520","6146040"," Give me one quick second."
"6146280","6147520"," I'm going to chart some of these out for you. "
"6150280","6151900"," We just five minutes here."
"6152180","6153080"," You guys hang out."
"6153160","6158300"," I'm going to do one, two, three, four, five, six, seven takers here in the background. "
"6158840","6162640"," We just one quick seven 50 plus tech waited right now."
"6162880","6166240"," And every reason talking about cyclical mode of movement and rotation."
"6166920","6172960"," I put the last bit of my cash to work in some of the I want to buy the SPX"
"6172960","6175740"," retest down here in yesterday's. "
"6176120","6177560"," Well, it's not here on this one."
"6177620","6185920"," You guys can't see this here."
"6185920","6189400"," Oh, this is the middle of January, the January 19th. "
"6189400","6190600"," That's bad boy right here."
"6191320","6193100"," You got the gamma flip right here."
"6193480","6194240"," I'm greedy. "
"6194560","6196440"," I want to see something like that right there."
"6196460","6200440"," 32 Black Rock 30 Alaska air 29."
"6201140","6205920"," Do you need to clear some brush from your property?"
"6206180","6206720"," You can't see. "
"6207640","6208480"," Hold on apex."
"6208680","6209260"," I got your brother."
"6209520","6210240"," Good to see you, apex. "
"6210940","6216620"," I want to buy 4,700 if I can, bro, on SPX that are in the same boat."
"6217020","6218780"," I think they have a lot more room to run."
"6219080","6223460"," However, whenever you put a group of stocks together, I don't care if it's the mega seven or these"
"6223460","6227560"," stocks, there's always going to be one that you're looking at and you're thinking, you know, maybe"
"6227560","6228460"," I should be doing something. "
"6228660","6230000"," So this may surprise you, judge."
"6230100","6230980"," It may surprise our viewers."
"6231920","6235460"," I'm not trimming it, but Boeing's at the top of the list of things to trim. "
"6236320","6240360"," It's a topic of discussion that I had with Stephanie, who's also a shareholder, as you know, just a"
"6240360","6242180"," couple of days ago and a commercial break."
"6242840","6247160"," And the reason for this is we just need about five, just need like five, maybe 10 minutes."
"6247160","6250720"," I got to do a some charting here in the background before you get to it. "
"6250820","6256760"," Good to see you, apex has become rather enormous in my portfolio."
"6257280","6259100"," I think there's plenty of room to run here."
"6259100","6260500"," And I'm not trimming today. "
"6260640","6263460"," My point is, is that it's it's a topic of discussion."
"6263700","6268980"," And see, Josh, as I pivot to you, I'd love your comment about Uber because I think if I remember"
"6268980","6273600"," correctly, you trimmed maybe 10% of your position in the last few weeks."
"6273600","6274100"," Am I right?"
"6274300","6275460"," Are you the one who did that?"
"6276180","6276620"," Yeah. "
"6277060","6277440"," Yeah."
"6277740","6279380"," I did it as it hit its high."
"6279720","6281860"," And not because I wanted to own less Uber. "
"6282360","6286940"," It's just the biggest winner I've ever been in, really, like, like it just it's a huge position."
"6287460","6288840"," And it went up so much."
"6288920","6292680"," And it went up a lot more than a lot of other stocks that I'm invested in. "
"6292800","6294780"," So that's, that's my cell discipline."
"6295360","6300680"," I do that when I have a really big outsized winner, just so like my whole life doesn't get, you"
"6300680","6302180"," know, wrapped up in how it does."
"6302360","6305660"," But that's what every, I think, prudent investor would do. "
"6305980","6311660"," It's not necessarily a judgment on whether or not they're still upside because I might have trimmed"
"6311660","6312140"," 10%."
"6312140","6314180"," But what that means is I held 90."
"6314540","6318280"," Well, I got some good ones here for you of being out of Uber. "
"6318780","6318960"," Right."
"6318960","6325920"," So my personal, my personal opinion is like, if you think of all the publicly traded companies that"
"6325920","6333600"," could become like the next mega tech platform company, Allah Magnificent Seven, Uber's on that list"
"6333600","6334580"," doesn't mean it's going to happen."
"6335040","6336120"," But it has that potential. "
"6336700","6343740"," They, they are the killer app for all things mobility, whether you want to ship liquor or food or"
"6343740","6349220"," people, anything you want to move physically from point A to point B, right, they're probably going"
"6349220","6350960"," to be the default choice to do that."
"6351220","6357240"," And that real estate that they occupy on our phones and in our minds is unreplaceable."
"6357440","6361080"," Uber is a verb in our, in our lives. "
"6361460","6363480"," And I think that's what I really like about it."
"6363720","6364280"," What about Carl?"
"6364480","6371920"," So your list includes Carlisle up 48, some SARA 44, Shake Shack 29, Matterport 27, Empire State"
"6371920","6376000"," Realty 22 against just since November 1st, as this market went nuts."
"6376660","6378960"," Talk to us about your thought process here. "
"6379800","6385060"," Well, a lot of those names you just mentioned are among my worst investments and stocks that I"
"6385060","6386520"," probably shouldn't even be in anymore."
"6387140","6388500"," So they will be dealt with."
"6388500","6391940"," I did not need tax losses per se from these positions. "
"6392520","6399860"," But if I did, boy, I'll tell you, I don't, I don't, I don't think that I handled the drawdowns"
"6399860","6403700"," in some of those names, the way that I should have in the last couple of years."
"6404460","6409700"," And, you know, I don't even want to get into the fundamentals of those companies because there's"
"6409700","6412300"," really not much exciting work sharing."
"6412700","6414660"," Yeah, there's the list. "
"6415100","6416440"," I appreciate the conversation, guys."
"6416560","6422780"," I think it's helpful, because let's face it, we know that, you know, some viewers follow you guys"
"6422780","6425820"," in to names that you mentioned repeatedly on this program."
"6425820","6430220"," They're probably wondering some of the very same things that I've asked you, whether they should"
"6430220","6431840"," trim some of their big winners or not. "
"6432120","6433540"," I hope your answers have helped them."
"6433880","6435280"," Chips have been a huge winner too."
"6436060","6439300"," The SMH is pacing for its best year since 2003 and 20 years. "
"6439960","6442820"," 80% of the SMH is outperforming the S&P."
"6443280","6444820"," That leads us to our chart of the day."
"6445000","6449120"," Thank you for the animation there because it's Micron, which is up near 7%. "
"6449120","6453040"," Christina Parson-Evelos is on the set with us at Post 9 to tell us what's going on here on"
"6453040","6453540"," the back of earnings."
"6454040","6458340"," Big B, guidance is on gross margins improved, which is what the street wanted, but I want our"
"6458340","6462820"," audience to know that all of that has to do with the selling price climbing higher, and this is"
"6462820","6463780"," really a volumes game."
"6464000","6468460"," Volume is low for a lot of these chips, and that's what's driving the stock forward, not"
"6468460","6469440"," necessarily demand. "
"6469640","6473840"," And I say that because even on the call, we have a quote for it, management warned that they don't"
"6473840","6478200"," expect volume growth to increase in Q2 or Q3 of next year."
"6478780","6483540"," Reasons for that is that producers have been cutting back to to get through excess supply, but the"
"6483540","6489180"," other major issue is when you switch to a regular memory chip to a more advanced one, it's way more"
"6489180","6489640"," complicated."
"6490120","6495500"," You'd take a larger wafer, use a lot more of the equipment, and so that takes much longer to go"
"6495500","6500060"," to market that increase their CapEx cost, but it also means a little bit less supply. "
"6500260","6506260"," So that played into this role, and it made me think, you know, this is great for fiscal 2024, why"
"6506260","6509580"," you're seeing so many price hikes across the board, JP Morgan."
"6510320","6513100"," Well, as far as the list continues, we can even show that as well."
"6513500","6520200"," But what about fiscal 2025, when all of this is riding on a good job, Bork, a good job with"
"6520200","6523980"," the bot with the bot, brother, you own the stock, right?"
"6524280","6525220"," Yeah, it's top 10 name of ours. "
"6525240","6526220"," I love this name."
"6526340","6533080"," And if this is a classic super cycle in memory here, Matthew meta just showed up and said just"
"6533080","6537780"," wanted to say, thanks got out of calls and put and went into puts yesterday."
"6539440","6542600"," 471 because of you also sold the clothes for a good profit. "
"6542920","6543820"," Thanks for all you do."
"6543960","6544560"," Matthew, meta."
"6544800","6545180"," Love you, man. "
"6545340","6547080"," The stock, the stock, Merry Christmas, brother."
"6547260","6549000"," It's been able to recover very well out of this."
"6549320","6550400"," The fact that he's upbeat. "
"6550780","6552080"," I think there's a good tail one."
"6552520","6557140"," Speaking of 2025, and yeah, their revenue in their net income is going to accelerate, I think 6.6"
"6557140","6557920"," billion in 2025."
"6559180","6562920"," This is, this is, I like to say, but like memory, he talked about last quarter was the trough. "
"6563360","6566500"," I think the stocks can be, I heard Kramer say it earlier today, a hundred dollar stock."
"6566760","6569140"," If we hold above yesterday's low, that's the line in the sand."
"6569520","6569980"," I want to own this. "
"6569980","6573660"," Indeed, to put some spirit, PJ traded his company S every night."
"6574000","6578500"," Well, it's like last night, it's going to stay like that for quite some time because of this AI"
"6578500","6578820"," play."
"6578960","6580420"," They even use the, the Midas touch of it. "
"6580480","6582220"," So like what's the last night, right?"
"6582500","6584800"," You had dealers basically chasing, right?"
"6584960","6593620"," And they offered it up to London, and then the US market, but they ended up running it up, right?"
"6593760","6595480"," Then they dump it on the open, usually."
"6596420","6597920"," Dealers are then neutral, right?"
"6599440","6602760"," You don't own this name."
"6603020","6603720"," I mean, you do own others. "
"6604220","6608100"," What do you, what do you think here about what's been an incredible move for the chips?"
"6608620","6612800"," Well, it's been an incredible move both in the size of the move, but also the breadth of it, right?"
"6612960","6615420"," We're no longer just talking about Nvidia and Broadcom."
"6615420","6620540"," And at least in part, that's predicated on the belief that end markets outside of AI are picking up"
"6620540","6625020"," internet of things, PCs, mobile phones, automotive and all that sort of stuff."
"6625200","6629000"," Now I heard, Christina, I just heard you throw in a little bit of maybe healthy cold water on that"
"6629000","6631660"," saying, hey, it's price, not volume, trade. "
"6631960","6633060"," Moxie's asking cap."
"6633320","6633940"," What's more likely?"
"6634360","6640640"," 45, 15 or 48, 18 before the new year, both on AI, but really low."
"6640800","6641440"," And let's do both. "
"6642240","6647190"," That's, I don't think we'll do both, but we could reverse to the upside if we did hit that 45,"
"6647630","6647770"," 15."
"6648710","6649990"," Let's talk about that really quick."
"6650250","6651790"," So I'm working on Mr. back here. "
"6652110","6654030"," Let's do some chatting here."
"6654170","6656370"," Let's go at a larger time frame here."
"6658530","6663330"," So trader, Moxie, let's kind of answer your question here, okay?"
"6663570","6668530"," Switch over here really quick. "
"6668750","6669990"," We'll mute this crap in the background."
"6670490","6672250"," It's a good question, trader, Moxie, hold on here."
"6677190","6679370"," You guys are going to draw it out for you, I will. "
"6687890","6691150"," We're just going to do this on a different hold on one second here."
"6714480","6717280"," Go to SPX."
"6717980","6718580"," Now it's got a spy. "
"6718820","6720500"," You guys, we're doing a spy, right?"
"6721640","6727190"," All the volume's all gone."
"6727350","6727950"," All that crap is gone."
"6728110","6730090"," Okay, so this is spy, right?"
"6730290","6730810"," 30 minute chart. "
"6737380","6738740"," We'll make it really simple."
"6749150","6752010"," We'll, we'll draw it like crayons, really simple."
"6754470","6755830"," Green box, right?"
"6757750","6759510"," Last known support in here. "
"6761910","6764910"," Nice range of consolidation right there, right?"
"6765710","6767210"," You can make it bigger if you wanted."
"6767990","6769370"," Basically right in here, right?"
"6769630","6775430"," Consolidate, squeeze up, come back down, cool your jets a little bit, right?"
"6776410","6778030"," Do I think we actually come this deep?"
"6778290","6784250"," Probably not, but another little green box right there, okay?"
"6784550","6785190"," I think it's really simple."
"6789320","6793840"," Spy, tell places to buy in here, right?"
"6804960","6807800"," Somewhere up in here, right there. "
"6817260","6819040"," Here's your big end of season."
"6819520","6821700"," Rip your Santa rally right here, right?"
"6822500","6823500"," Yee-haw, we're up there."
"6823620","6827360"," Get the all-time highs up in here, come back down and pull it down, right?"
"6828340","6830460"," Get our first winter low, right?"
"6832100","6834140"," Where in is that February usually?"
"6834140","6842960"," I can't see it on this chart where February is, but 10, that's February is over here, okay?"
"6852390","6859060"," Man, man, squeeze right there. "
"6866280","6871540"," Make this simple, real simple, real easy, right there."
"6885290","6886850"," Something like that, right?"
"6887770","6889750"," And then let's pretend this is it, we'll write this in."
"6896490","6905400"," Holiday rally, right there, right?"
"6953160","6954700"," I'm gonna march high in there. "
"6965400","6966880"," Did this one here?"
"7024360","7025180"," What are you looking?"
"7025440","7026660"," Nope, I didn't want that."
"7027260","7052180"," I just want something that'll something"
"7052180","7053380"," like that right there."
"7053500","7055040"," It's like really fast, okay?"
"7056800","7058140"," So there you go, let's take the list. "
"7058600","7060200"," Monster run coming up, right?"
"7060760","7063660"," You got your holiday rally, whoo, come on down here, right?"
"7064380","7065320"," Come down into February."
"7066180","7068540"," IWM is outperforming by the way here."
"7069180","7072340"," IWM is going up there in the march, boom, up there. "
"7072980","7077860"," S&P, cues, a little bit less good performance, bigger moves in IWM."
"7079860","7082860"," Now, what, when does this not work?"
"7083840","7089620"," So we blast down right here, let's say we start to break underneath to start flooding, right?"
"7090020","7093340"," Thesis is dead, right?"
"7094200","7097840"," But we stay on this track in here somewhere in here, this is the expectation."
"7099000","7108500"," To ask that question, trade moxie, take a snip. "
"7109400","7113140"," Hold on, this is right here."
"7116820","7118560"," We're talking like a move."
"7125000","7130780"," You have to measure this right here, but it's going to be a fucking monster. "
"7133080","7134120"," Five fifty."
"7134900","7137180"," Everyone's saying fifty one hundred, right?"
"7137620","7138960"," Fifty one hundred right there."
"7146340","7147260"," There you go. "
"7149480","7150920"," It's not that right there."
"7151020","7152660"," There'll be probably pullbacks in here."
"7152800","7155920"," There'll probably be a pullback at some point, some stupid shit like this. "
"7156880","7161780"," Come back down here, test that one right there and then move up right there."
"7162860","7163620"," Something like that."
"7163940","7164380"," How about that?"
"7165280","7167620"," You have to come another pullback in here or something like that. "
"7167880","7172900"," So question was, do we hit four fifty five one?"
"7176190","7177270"," That's right here."
"7180430","7183970"," If we do hit four fifty five one, you're buying the dip."
"7185850","7188890"," Just don't get trapped under this four sixty area. "
"7189890","7192310"," Four fifty five, four fifty four."
"7193010","7195530"," You'd want to like, you don't want to see this happen."
"7195690","7200190"," You don't want to come down here and buy that actual dip in case you get dropped. "
"7201490","7202950"," But man, I'm a bull."
"7203190","7204510"," I would love to see the blood."
"7204790","7211810"," So if we get this blood down here and you see us come back up and sit here, it'd be"
"7211810","7212970"," long in that right there. "
"7213270","7213590"," Make sense?"
"7216410","7221510"," Now, if we reverse and just start, maybe you think you're maybe you're like, oh yeah, well, you"
"7221510","7224690"," know, cap, what if we start just heading back up here and tagging that bad boy."
"7225110","7227010"," You just use your regular stuff, right?"
"7227190","7232650"," Price above one and five minute trigger, price above hourly trigger, reverse course over here."
"7232890","7233890"," I'll take that trade with you. "
"7234170","7236570"," But otherwise, right down here and then slam up there."
"7239260","7241560"," You want to snap that for yourselves right there?"
"7241660","7242040"," Does that work?"
"7244500","7246540"," We've got to put some blood up there too."
"7246640","7248660"," Can't we put that blood up there for you?"
"7250200","7250920"," Does that work?"
"7255680","7256440"," You got it?"
"7256640","7256940"," Okay. "
"7267170","7268130"," What's going on here?"
"7268210","7269310"," I'm not getting what I need here."
"7283630","7284510"," Does that work?"
"7286070","7287250"," I think that works."
"7288810","7295950"," Now, saying that I'm going to say something here to you, nice little bottoming action right here. "
"7297310","7299810"," Like that on the flip down there, like seeing it."
"7300670","7302930"," Now, I want to say something to you guys, okay?"
"7304590","7309830"," Even though I'm drawing that out for you, you start breaking and rejecting any of that shit."
"7310770","7312730"," We'll be back at the drawing board and that stuff. "
"7313290","7314490"," Like, you know, like Elliot Waivers."
"7315650","7317090"," I love Elliot Waiver."
"7317970","7321670"," But I'm going to tell you guys, you ever hear like break out the eraser?"
"7325130","7329370"," You know, some unknown news, something that's not known to the market, some extension. "
"7340340","7341640"," You know, I say this."
"7342320","7343540"," Hey, what's up, Basra?"
"7350680","7351660"," What do you got in here?"
"7351760","7352080"," Who's this?"
"7354660","7356500"," Oh, hey, ZZ."
"7356820","7357580"," Where's ZZ at?"
"7358800","7360060"," Hey, ZZ, you hear?"
"7360700","7362760"," It's ZZ back in here. "
"7363220","7363740"," Hey, ZZ."
"7364720","7365400"," Where you at, brother?"
"7365700","7366460"," You want to go hang out sometime?"
"7367160","7368060"," You want some of my love?"
"7369020","7370360"," Where's ZZ at in here?"
"7372420","7373500"," Where's ZZ at?"
"7374040","7375120"," Hey, ZZ, come back in here."
"7375460","7375880"," Where'd you go?"
"7376980","7378180"," Come back in here, ZZ. "
"7378180","7382540"," Listen, you are the worst stock trader and an analyst."
"7382740","7384200"," Your voice and face are super annoying."
"7384340","7384900"," Shits thing. "
"7385040","7385400"," Go to hell."
"7385820","7387200"," Come, Jim James, eat shit."
"7401600","7402500"," Where's ZZ do?"
"7402620","7403340"," Let's go find this guy. "
"7403420","7404160"," Let's go see who he is."
"7404740","7406020"," Let's go see who he is."
"7406800","7411640"," We'll find him on a, we'll go find his, let's go find his YouTube channel. "
"7412580","7414160"," Let's go find out how this guy is."
"7415580","7417520"," Yeah, some guy on a YouTube right now."
"7417880","7419520"," His name is ZZ. "
"7419760","7421140"," I wonder what the ZZ stands for."
"7422520","7423880"," Let's go find out who this guy is."
"7424420","7425120"," Think tight here. "
"7437060","7438640"," Hold on one second here."
"7439040","7439440"," Where are we at?"
"7442320","7444200"," Hold on one second here."
"7445620","7447660"," ZZ, what about the ZZ?"
"7450280","7451480"," Where's ZZ at?"
"7453280","7455180"," I want to find ZZ though. "
"7455720","7456580"," Where'd this guy go?"
"7460600","7461440"," Oh, Z."
"7461640","7463920"," Oh, so it's French for cock."
"7471780","7472380"," ZZ."
"7476640","7478160"," He's stinky or something. "
"7478500","7479000"," Is that what happens?"
"7479600","7480660"," You get, he got the stinky."
"7488100","7489200"," He's all stinky."
"7489940","7490660"," His stiper full. "
"7491580","7494540"," I don't know some guy called ZZ."
"7494640","7495540"," Don't know who he is."
"7496340","7499120"," He's like furiously sitting at home raging. "
"7499480","7502020"," It's probably probably blew up his account short in the market."
"7502600","7503840"," That's what I would expect, right?"
"7507680","7508780"," ZZ have Boise."
"7511760","7516400"," I wonder, I could probably say who I probably think it is, but there he is. "
"7516540","7517060"," Find him right there."
"7517160","7517680"," There he is."
"7517760","7518340"," I see him right here. "
"7519440","7520000"," Hold on."
"7523100","7524040"," Let me see."
"7524920","7527220"," Can I, oh yeah, we can do something. "
"7529300","7530020"," Promotes terrorism."
"7531060","7532380"," Suicide or self-injury."
"7534720","7536300"," Let me see what I can get for him. "
"7536740","7537120"," Here we go."
"7537840","7538660"," There we go."
"7542200","7543520"," There you go, ZZ. "
"7544700","7547960"," We just reported you for self-harm, man."
"7548080","7548480"," I apologize."
"7549440","7550760"," Go make sure you're okay. "
"7551080","7552440"," If you have family, ZZ."
"7553460","7555040"," You're not alone, are you?"
"7555800","7558720"," If you have, hey ZZ, seriously, if you're, I'm assuming, right?"
"7560180","7566260"," I'm assuming that you're, I'm assuming ZZ that you are at home with no one there, man."
"7566420","7566720"," You're upset. "
"7567440","7571660"," If you want, you can always DM me and send me your phone number."
"7571780","7572360"," I'll give you a call."
"7572480","7572880"," I'm not lying. "
"7573900","7575440"," And I'll give you a call and help you out, bro."
"7575700","7579220"," If you ever want some help or some love or anything like that, you want to text message me,"
"7580000","7582820"," something like that, I'm always more than willing to chat yet, bro."
"7583080","7584720"," But otherwise, we're going to move forward, okay?"
"7585260","7586020"," Find me on Twitter. "
"7586660","7587260"," Send me a DM."
"7588680","7590640"," If you, I don't know, maybe you're broke or something."
"7590860","7593960"," I'll send you, you want some money or something to go out and get a bottle or something like that. "
"7593960","7594520"," I can do that."
"7596060","7596780"," What's going on?"
"7596920","7597320"," DTM."
"7597460","7598360"," Good to see you in the house. "
"7599920","7601760"," There's a broad spot in his trading throat."
"7601940","7602200"," I know."
"7602780","7607300"," If I could just sit at home all day long, he's like, I'm going to go troll mountain today. "
"7608720","7609880"," I would love to be."
"7610020","7610540"," Can you imagine?"
"7610920","7619440"," I know, dude, because you're like, you're like, well, I guess if you're troll mountain, Johnny, you"
"7619440","7622500"," could be like, imagine being outside, taking a walk right now, getting laid."
"7625260","7628260"," Well, let me check my DMs and see if he's in my DMs here. "
"7628340","7629460"," Let me see if I got a message from him."
"7629700","7631340"," Oh, no messages from ZZ."
"7631840","7632940"," Come on, ZZ. "
"7634060","7635520"," Send me your phone number, man."
"7637220","7638180"," Come on, bro."
"7644080","7647200"," Hey, Burke, I just read your message on DM, and I appreciate that. "
"7651760","7653160"," We'll monitor text."
"7653460","7658880"," We'll monitor DMs and see if we'll monitor DMs and see if he needs some help."
"7663820","7665720"," Steve Millie, what's going on, brother?"
"7674100","7679060"," There's Redstone's national amusement, the change in the pay packages for the executives that makes"
"7679060","7680760"," it seem like there's a deal imminent. "
"7681020","7683220"," Let's go back and look at MSTR next."
"7683480","7699160"," Look at the signal, which is that the stock is under with"
"7699160","7701720"," you as they have to shut down our streaming head."
"7702420","7705840"," You know, Josh, I hear you on that, and I respectfully disagree. "
"7706060","7707240"," Now, this is a debate, right?"
"7707480","7711540"," And David Ellison at Skydance is rumored to want to shut down our streaming."
"7711540","7717880"," I get you, but the first thing we're going to do is MSTR MicroStrategy Incorporated."
"7718560","7721420"," There's still growing subscribers, pretty good, pretty good. "
"7721880","7725840"," And in around 65, 70 million subscribers, that's valuable to somebody."
"7726120","7726380"," Sell it."
"7726640","7727460"," Sell the streaming business. "
"7727480","7733680"," Jim, they have past peak losses because what they're going to do now, which is what every desperate"
"7733680","7739480"," company does when the shareholders start demanding profits, what they're going to do is milk the"
"7739480","7740360"," subscriber base."
"7740640","7742040"," They're not going to produce as much."
"7742080","7747080"," We're going to look at Mr. MSTR MicroStrategy Incorporated. "
"7748200","7754040"," Let's take a look at these guys here."
"7754580","7757080"," This is a 30-minute chart on MicroStrategy."
"7760020","7767160"," On a daily basis, right now, we've got declining positive velocity, even though price is going up. "
"7769260","7775340"," A little bit of distribution going on on the daily trigger right here, okay?"
"7776360","7781560"," Even though prices are higher, declining value."
"7782360","7784500"," So it's not showing a role."
"7784980","7789800"," I want to show you another example of this right here. "
"7790220","7793040"," Declining velocity, price following."
"7793420","7795880"," Declining velocity, price not following."
"7797280","7799400"," The weekly is strong, though. "
"7799640","7802500"," See how the sales bought here on the weekly."
"7804520","7808600"," I'm not showing you weekly value here, but it is strong."
"7808800","7810620"," I'll show you weekly value right here on the daily. "
"7813800","7815460"," Weekly value is pretty strong."
"7815580","7818000"," We can go higher on weekly value over here."
"7818540","7827400"," We're going to go back to the 30-minute chart right now on Mr. MSTR MicroStrategy Incorporated. "
"7828040","7831060"," Very old and not old, but big meme stock from back in the day."
"7832400","7834500"," So the daily trigger is kind of weak here."
"7835080","7838200"," The weekly trigger is really strong down here. "
"7839760","7844920"," I'm assuming you're going to try to buy this daily trigger and possibly lower to go back over here"
"7844920","7852880"," to this consolidation zone here at 4.22. I know for sure, not know for sure, but I believe hit"
"7852880","7857180"," down here on the weekly that we are going to have an awesome buy down there."
"7857640","7865760"," That's at 4.20.07. So if you're looking for a dip buy in April or February, you'll probably see"
"7865760","7868200"," that low in April or February."
"7869140","7870320"," I'll write that in there. "
"7870340","7872700"," You'll probably see that low in April or February."
"7879790","7886390"," In the meantime, if the market is trading up or down, I'm looking for dip buys down here at 534 "
"7886390","7903090",".71. If price can get above 581.57. Man,"
"7903110","7905830"," I'll tell you what, that big sell on 600 right here."
"7906310","7907190"," That might be it. "
"7908410","7909770"," That might be it."
"7910150","7911470"," You got a lot of all here."
"7914590","7919270"," Come back down here and finally get that tick right, that previous high tick. "
"7920150","7922270"," I saw you back down over here."
"7922990","7926110"," You got the daily trigger just moving higher, higher, higher, higher, higher."
"7926290","7927690"," I guess I should be higher than that. "
"7928690","7929190"," A little bit higher."
"7934290","7937290"," Get that hourly swooping down right there underneath."
"7937290","7939050"," Get the daily trigger right here. "
"7940270","7947450"," Get that blast down right here and boom, you're off and running and you're targeting 650."
"7948610","7950370"," You don't have a lot of time for this."
"7951770","7954510"," You don't have a lot of time for this to happen up here. "
"7955030","7963270"," You got a 650 target possibly into March, but I'm going to also be looking for some kind of a"
"7963270","7972270"," bloodbath rain into, I said March, but February, maybe March, then down here in April, blast down"
"7972270","7974210"," to the downside over here, a bloodbath."
"7974650","7979350"," You got a bloodbath setting up somewhere probably in late winter, early spring."
"7980210","7982670"," So that's MSTR for you. "
"7996580","7998600"," I'll work on the next ticker in the background."
"7998800","8000580"," I'm going to do AFRN next."
"8003200","8006420"," 10 bits of five-year tips total of zero dollars. "
"8015340","8017160"," Chase is asking, are we going to squeeze?"
"8020020","8021400"," Are we going to squeeze?"
"8021920","8024600"," Chase, I liked on the open this morning."
"8024680","8025980"," I liked the split, man."
"8026140","8031180"," I like to do, I didn't want to do, I figured the straddle would be the best trade because the"
"8031180","8033240"," puts in the calls were dirt cheap, man. "
"8033340","8034520"," They were all like 30 cents."
"8035340","8042640"," Take both sides for 60, cut one side loose, or leave it on and monetize one side, then the other"
"8042640","8044060"," swing the other way."
"8059800","8064840"," I can understand that like an MSTRN. "
"8064840","8065400"," Just holding."
"8065800","8067200"," Josh Brown, you bought it recently."
"8069320","8069800"," Yeah. "
"8070200","8073540"," Me and Kathy are going to ride this thing all through 2024."
"8073540","8075740"," I'm pretty excited to have her aboard."
"8076280","8084860"," Yeah, I think when I was looking at the options chain for today, if it's like 30 delta calls and"
"8084860","8089880"," puts are running like $1.50 or some stupid shit like that, I'd be like, yeah, I don't know about"
"8089880","8090140"," that. "
"8090860","8095200"," But 20, 30 cent calls and puts, does it matter which side you picked?"
"8095780","8097000"," Okay, probably not."
"8114240","8124100"," Uh, Chase, if you look on the chart on the bottom left hand side, you'll see"
"8124100","8125560"," the gamma flip."
"8125560","8126580"," We're right on it, brother. "
"8127520","8129320"," This is the gamma flip right here, man."
"8129340","8133320"," And they're really highlighting that in the earnings reports."
"8133800","8137460"," I think Caterpillar is very well positioned to profit off of that. "
"8137720","8139580"," One third of the revenue comes from sort of infrastructure."
"8140200","8141580"," China was a drag this year too."
"8141760","8145320"," So I think China turns a corner and Caterpillar weathered China very, very well. "
"8146080","8147780"," I mean, if we're talking about deer as well."
"8147960","8149240"," Well, deer's been a dud, right?"
"8149240","8150940"," I mean, it's been left behind."
"8151720","8154500"," Caterpillar's up 15 and a half percent in a month, deer's up two and a half. "
"8155260","8158080"," Year to date, it's down eight and a half versus a cat up 20."
"8158600","8161540"," Yeah, I will say, I've never timed a deer very well."
"8161660","8162680"," It's one of the stocks I can never timed. "
"8162940","8164360"," It might be because I'm so close to the agriculture industry."
"8165480","8173500"," And from the futures broker side, I deal with a lot of small to medium size farmers and look at"
"8173500","8175220"," look at our ag prices were last year."
"8175380","8176240"," They've been down drastically. "

"8187520","8189860"," I think ripped the band-aid off at the last earnings call."
"8190040","8190800"," I mean, that's what they did."
"8190840","8192700"," They really reset expectations low. "
"8193260","8197580"," I mean, the size of the guidance guy down is such that they have to set themselves a low bar"
"8197580","8197900"," to clear."
"8198020","8201660"," But to the point you're making the problem with gears, you're supposed to buy it when it feels"
"8201660","8205059"," absolutely like the wrong time when you're talking about crop prices going on."
"8206180","8211860"," You want a 13 times and it's flat over the last year and a half or so. "
"8211940","8213920"," This is actually the time you're supposed to lean in and buy it."

"8305180","8306100"," recent tight levels."
"8306500","8307559"," I reached a couple of weeks ago. "
"8307940","8312840"," The auction may require an additional concession say JP Morgan's strategist who also cited the"
"8312840","8316459"," auction sector appearing somewhat rich amid technically challenging backdrops."
"8316980","8322799"," So primary deal of positions in tips maturing in two to six years was about five billion dollars in"
"8322799","8322980"," the year."
"8324219","8327639"," I think the name is great brother. "

"8396560","8397120"," Feels it, right?"
"8397640","8397640"," Yeah."
"8397960","8402340"," I mean, obviously not bad to have no direct immediate follow through to the day."

"8445960","8446080"," Right."
"8446320","8446720"," The tone to it."
"8446900","8452880"," It had been locked into these tracks that were sort of tracing out, extending from an overbought"
"8452880","8455860"," level and adding and adding and adding in a grinding way. "
"8456200","8460640"," And then once you kind of jump off those tracks, long 4.71 C."
"8461100","8466480"," This is just sort of a little bit of a reset in a stretch market to maybe allow the end"
"8466480","8467560"," of your tailwinds to come through."
"8467900","8473000"," We'll track it towards the close when I see how close he leaves those onto the fucking bitter end."

"9457350","9463170"," you want to back test the daily and the monthly it's possible that you could also back test this"
"9463170","9467730"," weekly once more I'm going to show you why here in a second then you get the actual move to"
"9467730","9473930"," the upside here to 80 bucks okay so you understand all this and I want to explain why I'm saying"
"9473930","9482650"," that to you right now so we're getting really topping here on the daily lore highs on velo but"
"9482650","9488930"," weekly is bullish still but it's still really peeking right here right the monthly velo though is"
"9488930","9494410"," gorgeous this is like the stuff that you can see it's it's just ready to rock to get positive on"
"9494410","9502010"," a monthly basis to the upside okay I wanted to check the news that came out on I wanted to"
"9502010","9506990"," check the news that came out on a firm because I'm getting some mixed signals on this ticker right"
"9506990","9512850"," now as well so on a 30-minute basis here this is what I really like for swing trading you"
"9512850","9518350"," can see this daily is it's bullish as fuck it's sustainable of prices we have but we have a series"
"9518350","9523670"," of lower highs we have some some a little bit of weakness here on the hourly basis so I'm not"
"9523670","9531250"," I'm not really bearish on a firm it's been grinding higher and higher and higher but the one"
"9531250","9536090"," concern I have here I want to show you the one concern that I have here is when we have"
"9536090","9542970"," a daily cross of this monthly trigger people get people get emotional this monthly trigger is"
"9542970","9550250"," bearish believe it or not max bearish which is actually a signal to buy but we will oftentimes get"
"9550250","9559210"," a check of that cross so when this cross happens comes up here right you'll sometimes see a move"
"9559210","9568250"," down to tag it and then we go higher so maybe we maybe because of the hourly trigger looks great"
"9568250","9575590"," so I'm not anti this like squeeze up here maybe trying to attempt that for that 55 bucks but then"
"9575590","9580830"," I'm looking for really the real true buy-in to be like a slam down and if the option chain"
"9580830","9586810"," like someone was saying in the in the chat was too rich too expensive this would be a great"
"9586810","9594810"," opportunity you flush out all these assholes you jump in you buy them cheap and then the real move"
"9594810","9603830"," comes after to the upside now this this giving you or charting this right now you know if it runs"
"9603830","9609350"," away from you and just goes to the moon you miss the trade I think that I think if you"
"9609350","9615250"," were to do a hundred tickers like this you would better serve you to find the tickers out of the"
"9615250","9621470"," hundred tickers that actually make this move here and then you get your move tesla bulls can attest"
"9621470","9627810"," to this tesla bulls will tell you all the time they'll be like tesla bulls will have price right"

"14393050","14399370"," dates are directional only you could make an argument that if you bought zero dates on the opening"
"14399370","14406310"," low that you could hold them all day long and print a lot of money from my experience i when"
"14406310","14413130"," i buy a zero date it's a directional thesis as soon as we stop going in the direct soon as"
"14413130","14421010"," we stop in time going in the direction that i'm trying to go close them out renegotiate the trade"
"14425130","14434970"," uh there is no intrinsic value in zero dates except for the direction"
"14434970","14446450"," you're going in now on let's say i hold a call or a put overnight right so"
"14446450","14451910"," i buy some calls i buy zero i buy one date calls that will turn into zero date calls on"
"14451910","14461800"," the next day's open the day before i i negotiate or i come up with a"

"14469880","14476160"," right so if i buy some one date calls that will turn into zero date calls the following morning"
"14478480","14486820"," right i'm saying we're going to gap up overnight so let's say we gap up overnight right my bet paid"

"14496000","14504440"," now worth a dollar fifty cents now they're worth a dollar on the opening bell what would be the"
"14504440","14511580"," prudent thing for me to do number one would be is there an opportunity for us to gap on the"
"14511580","14518320"," open what's the probability of the gap on the open is the probability like a hundred percent ninety"
"14518320","14526300"," percent not like that high high probability of a gap up on the opening bell uh maybe i stay in"
"14526300","14534720"," those zero dates most of the time though about seventy percent of the time that is not true i made"
"14534720","14541080"," a bet for a gap up overnight so what do i do in an opening bell over time where i"
"14541080","14550540"," will over time make more money is going to be me closing those calls right at the bell on the"
"14550540","14558160"," open now i don't mean like the bell rings and i do it i have to probably wait sometimes three"
"14558160","14567780"," seconds fifteen seconds i take my money and i leave right now i just pocket it a dollar right i"
"14567780","14574640"," bet fifty cents i made a dollar i put the dollar in my pocket let's say i'm actually still bullish"

"14583320","14591740"," low probability of us gapping up but i still think we're going to keep gapping up or or even just"
"14591740","14600160"," go higher there's some mechanics that go on on that open if there's any pullback even if it's for"
"14600160","14607400"," like a five minutes they'll likely torch all those gains i made from the day before reset those"
"14607400","14613740"," calls and print them a second time that's true creating forty seven cents right now they're"
"14613740","14618800"," grinding me out here they don't want to give me the fucking the money call that's a problem second"
"14618800","14628720"," issue i am making a second bet with all of my gains so it would behoove me before"
"14628720","14636180"," the opening bell to set up a sell on the open right so i take my money and run i"
"14636180","14645960"," get my buck and rather than risking all of those gains maybe i look at a 30 delta"
"14645960","14653340"," strike on the open to jump back in on that continuation of a bullish thesis so i bought myself a"
"14653340","14660580"," dollar call our 50 cent call i printed a dollar from it right i capture all that money i betted"
"14660580","14666380"," and then we open boom i take my money and run and what do i look at if i'm if"
"14666380","14673320"," i'm trying to trade really fast i look down and i see a 30 cent call i grabbed that 30"
"14673320","14680800"," cent call maybe it's a 30 delta right on the open after i took my dollar i have now thanks"
"14680800","14690740"," uh what 20 cents nobody can take that away from me i've also pocketed my original buy-in so i"
"14690740","14699300"," am net up right and i have my bullish thesis i renegotiate the trade a second time rather than"
"14699300","14707280"," keeping it on the same trade on something that has zero intrinsic value now let's say i'm wrong and"
"14707280","14714480"," it rolls down on that call that i bought for 30 cents i am still on that 20 cents if"
"14714480","14721380"," we moon straight off the bell i'm going to make more bang chinese products again what how says us"
"14721380","14730780"," continuing its review of section 301 tariffs on chinese products if zero dates if zero dates get"
"14730780","14739920"," reprised on that opening bell i get a discount so all of those little mechanics are protecting my"
"14739920","14746740"," wealth protecting my winnings and renegotiating each step of the way on something with no intrinsic"
"14746740","14756560"," value now would i do that on calls that are a month"
"14756560","14765630"," out probably not that exact thing if i if i have a call that's a month out right three months"
"14765630","14771350"," out and we roll down for a day or two i'm likely not going to get destroyed in zero dates"
"14771350","14777330"," uh you're you're talking about something that's might be a buck and we'll never see a dollar again"
"14778010","14783490"," now i'm not going to bring it up here but what i would say what i used to use when"
