"1677250","1686190"," Then when I started to talk to her about I was like you should donate to who uh someone or"
"1686190","1692090"," something that you're interested in like if you're you know if you're if you care about cows you"
"1692090","1702050"," donate to cows if you're interested in purple paint you don't and so I'm like so I'm explaining"
"1702050","1705850"," this to her but then the other thing that I want was trying to explain her as I still haven't"
"1705850","1710530"," figured out and I haven't approached it yet Lagarde saying there's a strong likelihood that rates"
"1710530","1720360"," will start to go up before the end of the year the thing that I didn't couldn't explain to her"
"1720360","1727900"," was we don't know how to it or age is because I don't know I don't know how to bring"

"4326730","4332830"," money selling that comes in at these moments where we are right now take take note of this that"
"4332830","4339510"," we're at a high risk of relentless selling a mark this this will be a market liquidation we're at"
"4339510","4347450"," 40 percent on the breadth indicator this will either happen today into tomorrow or possibly next"
"4347450","4355270"," week you can see it happen on friday's friday monday if they hold the market up for the big tech"

"4364800","4369340"," other the other thing that could happen would be you have real money selling today it'll be"
"4369340","4374700"," relentless today and tomorrow you'd wait for uh for that buy signal to come in which we don't have"
"4374700","4392580"," yet so"
"4394730","4399950"," there we go uh still not sure if this holds don't take my word for it on this being bottom"
"4399950","4407130"," uh but this is i think this is worthy of the the possible print out because that the the snapback"
"4407130","4435100"," could be worth hundreds hundreds of percent so we'll take that risk yeah"
"4435100","4440420"," this is the time these are the times when you just you you literally tune out every bear you turn"
"4440420","4448200"," them off this is not the time to be listening to a bear these are the times when you get"
"4448200","4459640"," focused on buying a market bottom so literally tune them out don't"
"4459640","4472740"," worry we're gonna do this with about a we're gonna do this about a half a million dollars i"
"4472740","4482100"," bet i would bet when we're making these trades that uh we'll probably have a attrition rate of"
"4482100","4492010"," panic probably 90 percent of the people in the in that trade by the end i by the end i"
"4492010","4496290"," bet we get a nutrition rate of about 90 percent even if they don't tell you that they that they"
"4496290","4515600"," aren't doing it i bet there's an attrition rate of at least 90 percent so"
"4515600","4522560"," i'll know today if we get the break in the market today or tomorrow or next weekend we're close"
"4522560","4531740"," though we're close to the breaking point of the market you can see it down here at four third or"
"4531740","4540060"," excuse me four or 39 percent right now you can see it down below anything below 40 percent is where"
"4540060","4545500"," the risk comes in to that break it's also a leading indicator to that moment where the market does"
"4545500","4552800"," break down and if we get that break we'll be ready to take that trade uh either today or tomorrow"
"4552800","4558340"," or next week we're close we're closer that we've been waiting for for what three weeks now i think"
"4558340","4564900"," three four weeks we first started talking about doing this so we're almost there not quite there"
"4564900","4594170"," but almost no"
"4594170","4605050"," i'm not on uh i'm not on spreads right now i'm on a snapback trade where we"
"4605050","4609790"," are in the market right now at this moment usually what happens is there's two things that happen"
"4609790","4619650"," here you either get a snapback or we get market liquidation in both cases it's worth it"
"4619650","4626450"," to buy this bottom even if it fails because the print on it is going to be fucking huge it'll"
"4626450","4632670"," be like four five six hundred percent typically and if you if it fails though it doesn't matter"
"4632670","4641510"," because the cost is so fucking cheap and then if it does break uh we're lined up to go full"
"4641510","4650290"," full um port into into into into the market so you're you're either looking for one of two things"
"4650290","4657650"," you're either looking for where we are once we're down here right i think i just went over this few"
"4657650","4664590"," minutes ago but you either get this break if you don't get that break you'll get a like a quick"
"4664590","4670390"," relief and then you'll get the break so there's money you've made in this quick in this quick"
"4670390","4677670"," relief right here um now if this quick relief doesn't work and it liquidation breaks it doesn't"
"4677670","4683730"," matter your ultimate goal as a bull is to buy this down here um now the calls that you buy"
"4683730","4688970"," in here they have to be dirt cheap they'll be like five pennies ten pennies anything like that if"
"4688970","4698820"," this were to trade out or work out for you we're almost there we're doing well close that"
"4698820","4716440"," up now"

"5395900","5401340"," market liquidation you'll end up seeing um you know a fake breakout fake v-shaped recovery and then"
"5401340","5407500"," you'll end up seeing it take place into the bell and then you'll see it take place uh also into"
"5407500","5412580"," monday usually not usually but sometimes you'll see it continuing like a monday you'll see like"
"5412580","5421320"," that you'll see that fake recovery into the bell and then down through the weekend uh you'll start"
"5421320","5428710"," to get down to uh lower lower and lower numbers so i hope you will get that i mean i"

"5454610","5463300"," yourself just like this real simple get a little bit tighter you know the bear is a right up here"
"5463300","5469980"," around 432.50 if you're bearish here and you're like hey i want to get bearish still not done"
"5469980","5478220"," getting bearish you're going to look for something like this right or something like this down into"
"5478220","5487850"," the bell so you could do like an a b buy in and then a c over here maybe if"
"5487850","5503530"," you wanted a stop loss as a bear it's going to be up here somewhere yeah"
"5503530","5508050"," like your wounds up here if you're going to take another if you're going to take another short into"

"5568020","5577420"," this squeeze from happening uh where'd be a price target 435 would be first stop if it squeezes 440"
"5579860","5586460"," yeah first stop first major stops at 435 unless the bears keep you know if the bears keep rolling"
"5586460","5591280"," over in this market if they keep selling can we get a liquidation break uh it's not going to matter"
"5591280","5599750"," you get to 435 but 440 believe it or not and that sounds absurd uh but if they can't win"
"5599750","5605230"," here or if they close for profit down here at any point if the selling stops you would expect to"
"5605230","5615210"," see a snap a higher to uh to 440 435 than 440 i'll bring"

"8216080","8224240"," love an opportunity to buy Amazon down below here but the question becomes does it break lower due"

"8228500","8236100"," they introduced something all right that's not going to take well matter of fact i think i answered"
"8236100","8244139"," a question on Amazon about what i don't like about them right now which could be used for for some"
"8244139","8252320"," kind of a risk of selling now i wouldn't expect Amazon to sell it to break down here i wouldn't"
"8252320","8257780"," expect Amazon to break down below these levels when i expect a hedge fund or a bank to want to"
"8257780","8267059"," buy this but or market conditions to sell it send us lower now i think the price target for"
"8267059","8276580"," down the road is when let's look this price target here is you know we started in July 9th"
"8276580","8285580"," until August 12th right some time on it to come down and then make its way back up again so"
"8285580","8294360"," i'd be a buyer down below here at 2630 2640 i'm not really too concerned about unless there's"

"8322889","8334370"," they they move in they move in these weird not weird pretty easy to see moves right you can"
"8334370","8340389"," kind of see these the previous years and these these goes back like right to the 2000s and they'll"
"8340389","8346370"," consolidate uh this is more just how banks trade these they like to trade these stocks and then"
"8346370","8352270"," then you're going to like hire AMD's like famous for this too i think um you'll see like AMD's like"

"8357690","8362610"," or two years or whatever and then it makes a move when you see these moves take place to these"
"8362610","8367650"," new trading zones in these tickers sometimes they get liquidated you saw that happen with facebook"
"8367650","8375870"," you saw it happen with um now netflix recently right you and netflix has happened once in the past"
"8375870","8383350"," where they liquidate so when you spend all this time in this trading zone even here you see this"
"8383350","8390110"," this this tag down below right there's sometimes uh and i guess the amazon bulls that say yeah"
"8390110","8398210"," we've done that already cap uh there's our there's our bottom uh for actually a huge leg higher but"
"8398210","8402890"," sometimes they're deeper uh than what they what they may seem uh this one wasn't this one was"
"8402890","8407450"," higher low up this low over here now but this is a lower low over here right we've got this"
"8407450","8412050"," lower low over here uh and we are kind of trading high on amazon so do i think we can"

"8438230","8443490"," the market all the time um so what do i think if we're going to buy it down here at"
"8443490","8453470"," uh at 2,500 yes um can you put some easy stop losses in here yes uh do you care"
"8453470","8458050"," about ER the sheriff no if it if it starts to trade out for ER you can have an opportunity"

"8495930","8503070"," here's my due diligence i keep it pretty fucking basic is it a matter of just taking profit off 37"
"8503770","8509110"," 73 is that simple probably um do they want to buy it probably down here does a does like a"
"8509110","8514470"," bank want to buy it fucking cheaper than that probably um a bank probably wants to buy it down here"

"8534190","8539310"," think the market being repriced gets us down there i think it needs to be something like the"
"8539310","8546990"," results of today's federal federal reserve repo operation 81 counter parties taking 1.77 trillion"
"8546990","8555310"," dollars in today's reverse repo i think the only way that you get down here is some really fucking"
"8555310","8560970"," bad news you don't know about about amazon could be anything right market share like that flick"
"8560970","8567130"," saying to me competitors we'll talk about that a minute um for a market crash would take us down"
"8567130","8573830"," there um i don't know maybe like some space lights crashing or something it'd have to be something"
"8573830","8580350"," major for use for excuse to get us down there for a market crash but on that same topic of"
"8580350","8584870"," market share if there was ever an announcement by like Shopify if Shopify could ever pull their"
"8584870","8590830"," head out of their asses believe it or not and uh announce an amazon type service that would fucking"
"8591470","8595750"," fucking tank amazon amazon would go to the depths of fucking hell and i don't give a flying fuck"
"8595750","8601030"," about a aws it would be used in a minute to dump it and that's probably the biggest risk to"
"8601030","8607110"," amazon is if there was a competitor now there now Shopify and a couple others i did some research"
"8607110","8612890"," recently on Shopify and a couple other companies are trying to believe it or not come after amazon"
"8613850","8618590"," that could be a news headline down the road it's not today but it is happening there are companies"
"8618590","8624610"," trying to replace amazon right now uh and compete with amazon i think Shopify specifically is"
"8624610","8631890"," building uh i think it's Shopify that's building a network of shipping across the country that to"
"8631890","8640550"," match amazon's uh infrastructure and once you're able to do that if you're able to compete with um"
"8640550","8648950"," with the logistics of amazon you have an ability to um to take market share with amazon and what"
"8648950","8658420"," that involves is uh what with it involves is is the comment i made on twitter the day someone asked"
"8658420","8661760"," the question about what don't you like the most about amazon and i had like three three or four key"
"8661760","8667340"," points i'd like whenever i buy something ramazon and i'm like yeah i want or it says you can have"
"8667340","8673640"," this tomorrow by two p.m or today by 10 p.m or yeah anything within the first two to"
"8673640","8677440"," three days they'll see you can have it with the next 12 hours or something between like let's say"
"8677440","8682260"," it says uh you can have between 2 p.m and 4 p.m tomorrow just say it's an example"
"8682260","8687820"," i've hit the buy it now button and immediately it tells me go fuck yourself you ain't getting it"
"8687820","8695560"," for three days i'm like then why the fuck did you just offer me that like 10 minutes ago like"
"8695560","8700280"," five minutes like two minutes ago you said to me i could have it in 12 hours that's a big"
"8700280","8706980"," problem for me now i'm already in the mindset of amazon being two-day shipping which uh i can"
"8706980","8711520"," understand hey it's gonna hey there's battery we have certain problems or whatever i can actually"
"8711520","8715660"," understand some of that stuff and i'm not on a time frame for it but i have a problem when"
"8715660","8721800"," i order something that i need in a certain amount of time or that's more convenient than me going"
"8721800","8730060"," someplace to pick it up sooner if i'm looking on amazon for a fucking box of cracker jacks and i"
"8730060","8733600"," don't care when i get it but i don't care if it's two-day shipping or a week shipping i"
"8733600","8737700"," just don't fucking care but if you advertise to me hey you can have it the next five fucking"
"8737700","8742440"," minutes you better fucking deliver it in the next five fucking minutes because i'm looking"
"8742440","8747300"," specifically and it's usually a higher price too which is even weirder you can actually find a"
"8747300","8751560"," cheaper price with longer-time shipping on it but if you're if i'm looking for something to say"
"8751560","8755160"," like hey i need some fucking glue for this project and i don't want to go to the fucking home"
"8755160","8758860"," depot for it and i just want to keep working i don't need to get it done right now but"
"8758860","8764520"," if i have it later today or tomorrow i'm good they fail on that right now amazon fails on that"
"8764520","8769240"," promise right now fuck two-day delivery they fucking suck at anything that they promise if they're"
"8769240","8774900"," promising you something when you're buying it they fucking suck at it and that's worse than even"
"8774900","8779600"," two-day shipping or it'll be there this week uh to not know when you're not there to not have"
"8779600","8784720"," it when in a time constraint because it's a specific time thing right so that's a big problem for"
"8784720","8792380"," amazon uh that they need to work on either don't advertise it or follow through with it and that's"
"8792380","8795960"," a bigger problem than the two-day shipping or if they made it five-day shipping it's a bigger"
"8795960","8801060"," problem believe it or not because now what i do is we're especially recently the past six months or"
"8801060","8804960"," so if it says that i can get it in the next fucking five minutes i'm either looking for the"
"8804960","8809720"," cheaper the same product on their site that gets me two days or i'm just not doing it if i"
"8809720","8814420"," need it that soon uh so they're losing that business from me that's important to their bottom line"
"8814420","8820800"," my second issue with amazon is they've utterly and completely fucking failed at uh clothing"
"8820800","8828400"," completely and only fucking failed uh i go i try to go there to order some shit like out or"
"8828400","8833200"," pack a t-shirts or i wanted to get into their program to get some clothes from them or i"
"8833200","8838820"," feel like for a fucking ski jacket or goggles or anything right if i'm like i need something if i"
"8838820","8843220"," go to my local ski shop and they're low-end shit in the old and not the olden days fucking"
"8843220","8847260"," pre-2020 even when you went to a ski shop you wouldn't get the items that you wanted to get"
"8847260","8851980"," to like backcountry.com to get something right specific that you wanted but you couldn't try it on"
"8851980","8856180"," because it wasn't available in a store it's a big fuck show but now if you go on amazon a"
"8856180","8861620"," lot of their products either suck they're like and they're recommended and they just suck their"
"8861620","8871370"," pieces of shit imported junk like like you'd get uh or alibaba or they are"
"8871370","8878890"," ill-fitting the cut of what you're getting is not um not fitting for you these clothes are not"
"8878890","8885090"," being cut for an american i'm not saying like you're fattering i'm saying like you're your your"
"8885090","8890110"," your torso is too short or the legs are too short that you know who they're making them for is"
"8890110","8893930"," people that are of smaller stature on who i don't know if any of you have ever lived in southeast"
"8893930","8899970"," asia or asia proper you're like the tallest and the biggest fucking guy there no matter how much"
"8899970","8906170"," away you look like i was 165 pounds six foot one and i was still a fucking giant uh standing"
"8906170","8910350"," around in asia i don't know what your experience then but anyways my point is uh that they're"
"8910350","8915590"," making clothes that aren't for you and even they're they're sizing uh still absurdly fucked up when"
"8915590","8920190"," you do get into your size so they fail on that aspect as well so they haven't been able to"
"8920190","8924710"," capture that business from me where i can go and get a pair of shoes from them and feel confident"
"8924710","8933290"," or i can go and get a quick uh from some known company but if i go on there and"
"8933290","8940330"," look for ski jacket let's say it's the only choices you really have are are stuff that you don't"
"8940330","8947430"," know it won't fit you it's it's ill made it's not quality um or you can't find something named"
"8947430","8954410"," brand like that's the other issue right so that's my second problem uh with amazon right now uh so"
"8954410","8961790"," the timing of deliveries and commitment some promises deliveries and then the cotton quality of"
"8961790","8965250"," their goods i don't really have too many other issues i don't mind there i think my fact i think"
"8965250","8972530"," some of their that prime uh i've got some small nitpicking to do on their prime video um but i"
"8972530","8977570"," actually like some of their movies more than a lot of other uh streaming services i don't like how"
"8977570","8980810"," they organize stuff and how they're always trying to pimp something out on you when you try to find"
"8980810","8986150"," something their organization sucks on prime but whatever it's free it's it's included i don't mind"
"8986150","8991990"," the cost personally for amazon prime i don't really uh pay attention to it if it goes up or goes"
"8991990","8997290"," down it's just a matter of convenience but i do get really fucking irked with the timing shit i do"
"8997290","9002150"," especially when they're like hey you'll have it tomorrow like that that's a fucking problem uh i"
"9002150","9005650"," have a problem with that and i can find some things there that are hard to find so that they"
"9005650","9010550"," do a good job on some stuff uh but then on the flip side of this right if you've got"
"9010550","9017110"," a company like shopify where one of the things about that's good about shopify and etsy and that"
"9017110","9022210"," that whole thing if they combine the both of them is if you were able to just search a site"
"9022210","9031970"," like amazon and find like a quality handmade good for a quality uh seller of let's say vintage Levi"
"9031970","9039530"," jeans for a reseller of sporting goods uh laid an example would be if you go to backcountry as a"
"9039530","9044570"," website called geartrade.com where you can buy second seconds and knock out not knock out it's just"
"9044570","9051970"," seconds and um return goods and you can buy resell goods there's no option for that there's no like"
"9051970","9057930"," backcountry option for um for amazon generally for high quality goods either it's hot dude if you"
"9057930","9062870"," find some high quality on amazon from reseller it's like double or triple price it's that same"
"9062870","9067330"," problem that ebay has now when you try to buy something off ebay like i don't know like an ebay"
"9067330","9073210"," problem i don't even bother doing the uh bidding anymore right i just go to like i click on buy"
"9073210","9079590"," it now and uh cheapest uh shipping plus the cost of the good and then i scroll through with the"
"9079590","9084810"," quality of the product i'm looking for or if it's new if it's used it doesn't matter and nine times"
"9084810","9089950"," out of ten the new products on ebay are fucking 20 30 percent more expensive than anywhere else you"
"9089950","9097310"," can get them uh so ebay is all fucked up too but there's a chance there for there's a chance"
"9097790","9102430"," there's a chance there for the market to uh to come up with a better solution than whatever amazon"
"9102430","9107630"," is doing right now so you need some kind of headline news like that on amazon to start to break"
"9107630","9115690"," below here for um or market conditions to get down to like 1900 or 1600 so my take on amazon"
"9116950","9121010"," is that you just look for that you just look for this moment to buy down below"
"9121010","9131010"," my price target blowing unicorn rainbows out their ass they trade or right"
"9131010","9135810"," around believe it or not they trade right around their er's in my opinion not 50 point moves not"
"9135810","9144210"," 100 point moves um this is a great traders uh ticker and of course uh you've got down here these"
"9144210","9149810"," previous lows and we know we've got buyers down below just waiting uh but as a buyer of amazon shit"
"9149810","9155570"," we can get down here like 2600 fucking buyer all day long unless some other fucked up news comes"
"9155570","9162790"," out like like uh like Netflix did unless you get something like that so amazon let's take a look at"
"9162790","9167450"," it so we can get it loaded up here might take a minute that was a moving back and forth"
"9167450","9176950"," here hold on here not too many sellers here right on amazon not really a big mover right now"
"9176950","9186380"," they're all sitting above a 3000 that's where all the sellers are sitting on a break of 2900"
"9186380","9192360"," looking for a market break as well we already know that we're talking about that got some support"
"9192360","9202030"," down below here at 2850 2800 and what we're really looking for is down below much further below"
"9203270","9209430"," we're looking to see if there is a limit buy order down here at 2600 seems pretty large down here"
"9209430","9216550"," right but buyers at 2600 that's what i'm going to call for between now and their er and epilepsy"
"9216550","9221870"," and all that kind of noise if you're going to buy amazon day trade is a little bit different but"
"9221870","9227890"," if you're looking to buy amazon it's fucking 2600 that's where it is somewhere down here somewhere"
"9227890","9234130"," right around 2600 on amazon we'll look at it we'll we'll stretch it out for you here so you can"
"9234130","9246080"," see what's up with it more sellers right now on amazon big support"

"9256060","9263400"," waiting their er statement that might be a nice buy area but in reality it's down below here looks"
"9266050","9270970"," like they want to step up to 2700 not even 2650 if you're going to be a buyer of amazon"
"9270970","9280450"," looking for weakness in it i would i would set an alert on not 2650 that i'm calling for i'd"

"11566750","11572390"," correction i think you're i think you're beyond correction if you get below 420 the bears totally"
"11572390","11579250"," want to take it past 420 they want to see this thing not just hit 420 today but they want"
"11579250","11586650"," that that lower bound right they want to hit that four thousand mark otherwise the bears have not"
"11586650","11593110"," been able to do it since january you know that since january they've admit those attempts one two"
"11593110","11600910"," three four and this would be the fifth try to try to break down not just to not just down"
"11600910","11608930"," not just down here though the bears for that bear case really want to break through 420 and smash"
"11608930","11615730"," it down to the four thousand level we've talked since beginning of the year that we could trade"
"11615730","11622630"," down here right multiple times this year we have done it one two three four and here comes number"
"11622630","11629610"," five does this regime continue on into september or even end of the year or do we just give it"
"11629610","11637570"," up and start selling it down even deeper what does this mean for the market so far doesn't mean too"
"11637570","11643170"," much right we're still kind of in this in this lower bound we're finding great places to buy"
"11643170","11650910"," bottoms down here but for that big bear case they need to start breaking the market down even lower"
"11650910","11657310"," right we haven't seen lower lows we've got 410 back here or excuse me we've got 420 back here we've"
"11657310","11662550"," got 410 or so down here and then we've got another strike above i think that was 412 and then"
"11662550","11669190"," apparently this was this is for 14 or something 412 and then we're we're we're they're trying to"
"11669190","11675730"," say fuck you we're going lower cap this is where we're headed this down to 4 000 is that bear"
"11675730","11682270"," case viable that we break down and if we do take the market down here is that what would you"
"11682270","11688550"," call this at this point right this isn't really a bear market this is more corrective in nature"
"11688550","11694990"," than then trading down to 420 if we trade on a 420 or so you'll get your you'll get your"
"11694990","11701390"," market breath will be down right this is how we'll get down here but that the bears want to get"
"11701390","11706570"," even lower i would say this i wouldn't call this a correction at this point right this is that this"
"11706570","11712930"," is the five letter word that everybody's looking for do we get the market crash i don't know if we"
"11712930","11716670"," get the market crash we have to actually look let's look at a percentage wise since the beginning"
"11716670","11721370"," of the year what that what that would look like at this point and this is only on a threat"
"11721370","11728010"," we're only at 0.25 and 0.5 on the market but let's take a look and let's measure out"
"11728010","11734290"," what that would look like down to four thought excuse me down to 4 000 sorry i'm hiccuping it right"
"11734290","11740890"," here we'll take a what we'll measure and see what that would mean down to 4 000 i'm just gonna"
"11740890","11755210"," find the measuring tool over here we just"
"11755210","11778210"," do seconds here i'm"
"11778210","11790570"," just gonna take a look at this over here pick it up percentage one"
"11790570","11795810"," second i'm trying to get this thing up we'll bring it over here so you guys can see it let's"
"11795810","11805580"," see if we can bring this whole on here so from peak to trough"
"11805580","11814950"," here we're at 7.29 percent this goes back to let me see where"
"11814950","11824330"," this april 20 seconds let's bring it smaller so at 4.5 4 "
"11824330","11832750",".7 percent currently on the es right this is not quite the crash material if you would have a"
"11832750","11840470"," corrective if it's corrective in nature we'd get down let's make this one yellow damn i'm gonna get"
"11840470","11848430"," the fill in there if you're down so we're down let's just peak to trough in two days right this"
"11848430","11858630"," is 4.75 percent if you were to get down to 420 that's 6 "
"11858630","11864850",".8 percent from peak to trough and that's just a few days right this is this would be a correction"
"11864850","11871450"," we're in corrective territory down to 420 now if you get a break if you get a break of this"
"11871450","11881190"," 420 if we trade down to if you're going to get your correction"
"11881190","11886310"," right this is a sort basically a certified correction close enough and horseshoes and hand grenades"
"11886310","11894350"," but the key is do you get not just market liquidation but do you actually take it back down even"
"11894350","11901490"," deeper this is the key point here right as as we're trading down here this was today and tomorrow"
"11901490","11909030"," that's 7.21 percent if this is friday if this is friday let's say into friday into monday or friday"
"11909030","11916190"," into monday of next monday or next friday monday 7.21 percent right this is a huge correction if"
"11916190","11921310"," you were to get this move now if you have this break if you have lower our higher lows still"
"11921310","11926930"," uh still not showing the market rolling over but if you were to break down below this in the coming"
"11926930","11934970"," weeks uh you are now down to 11 percent right what does that 11 percent mean uh to you out"
"11934970","11942910"," there well that's the definition of a market crash anything over 10 percent over a few days or just"
"11942910","11949290"," a small time period this would be a market crash territory down here so if you start to track below"
"11949290","11956070"," here this would be a certified market crash so right now as as we are let's say at 430 we'll"
"11956070","11962570"," keep it right 4.63 if we look at the market breadth you would see this as a full corrective"
"11962570","11970510"," measure that we would expect a full corrective measure heading into this month this friday monday"
"11970510","11978870"," or this uh or even put the following next friday monday in the midst of earning season now for"
"11978870","11984910"," bears that are calling for uh four thousand that would mean that we are in a in a in not"
"11984910","11991450"," just a corrective state but also into our market crash so here's my question that i want to put"
"11991450","11996210"," towards or give towards you okay for where we are right that's an important question you've got"
"11996210","12006050"," geroam powell yesterday in his interview stating uh that it does not matter does not matter if"
"12006050","12014490"," we peaked inflation in march that he is committed uh to his regime of of raising interest rates"
"12014490","12021570"," this year uh specifically said this year yesterday that he is committed to the regime so if you're"
"12021570","12026930"," telling me which i'm not against this i'm going to ask in you out there because yeah i made a"
"12026930","12033050"," comment yesterday in stream wall geroam was speaking and i said to you yesterday in in the stream"
"12033050","12039650"," wall geroam was speaking and i said the key point behind what he just said today is that he's"
"12039650","12045890"," committed right that no matter what and we talked yesterday about how they apply too much they go"
"12045890","12053350"," they like they applied too much money back in march of 2020 they uh then now they're going to as"
"12053350","12059210"," the pendulum swings they're going to apply an even heavier hand and what they're saying is going to"
"12059210","12064290"," happen this year in the market right they're telling you it where he he's telling you yesterday"
"12064290","12069290"," fuck you no matter what i'm committed to raising rates this year and not only am i committed to"
"12069290","12075590"," raising rates we're going to fucking do it all year long fuck the fed put we're not doing it no"
"12075590","12081270"," matter what and the market is showing a reaction yesterday and today that that comment and that and"
"12081270","12086970"," that statement so my question to you out there is if he's committed and we said this was the key"
"12086970","12093070"," point was yesterday was or the key statement that he said yesterday was boy him saying that at this"
"12093070","12100930"," moment opens the door to a recession sooner than later that he's actually there's the chance that"
"12100930","12108890"," he could trigger a recession in the market and what would that what what would that trigger be to a"
"12108890","12117190"," to a market recession and so most certainly if he was to continue with the path of raising interest"
"12117190","12121990"," rates through the rest of the year or at least let's say the next three fed meetings he goes point"
"12121990","12129230"," five or point five bit bps every every every meeting right and commits that it says we i don't give"
"12129230","12136430"," a fuck if inflation is is has been tampered down since march we're going to stay in this regime and"
"12136430","12141170"," he's committed to that right we could we can quote him on that uh that the market in in its"
"12141170","12148890"," reaction let's say it was to uh to to sell down to this to this uh to four thousand where"
"12148890","12154370"," we are that's a mark this is a certified market crash so you're going to explain and tell to me"
"12154370","12162150"," if we trade down to four thousand and he's going to continue as we trade down to this four thousand"
"12162150","12168810"," mark to apply interest rates down here that would support if we have a market crash and increased"
"12168810","12174310"," interest rates uh my con but the context that i'm trying to say to you is that would trigger a"
"12174310","12180250"," recession in my view uh is that you would see that recession actually accelerate you wouldn't hit"
"12180250","12185810"," it maybe in a year or two during the next election cycles you could i would actually trigger a"
"12185810","12194210"," massive massive market sell-off in four thousand right now for this move four thousand right now"
"12194210","12200250"," for this move that we're making today uh at these lows right is that is where the question comes in"
"12200250","12206890"," the question becomes do we not just sell down to 420 do we not just sell down uh to to"
"12206890","12212370"," retest down this level right here we don't if we don't just test this level and trade down below it"
"12212370","12217430"," uh what is what is that trigger it figures that we know it's technically a market crash we also"
"12217430","12223170"," know that the Fed President the President Jerome Powell has said that regardless of where the"
"12223170","12230510"," market is the regardless of where inflation is he is committed committed uh to continue to raise"
"12230510","12237590"," interest rates uh in the coming in the coming quarters which is fascinating and interesting from"
"12237590","12243390"," the statements that he made yesterday he's been no policy change uh but he's reinforced that no"
"12243390","12249190"," matter what those rates are coming this year i want to know from you if you think that if we"
"12249190","12254150"," were to trade down to 420 then make our way down to four thousand have a market crash in the"
"12254150","12258310"," coming week or two so as i know some people are saying no we're going to four thousand i saw"
"12258310","12263330"," some of that chat in the chat earlier if you think that that's going let's say let's say we let's"
"12263330","12268970"," say we did go to four thousand and the next week or two right my question to you is do"
"12268970","12274570"," you think that the Fed is still going to raise rates like he has said he would continue to do"
"12274570","12281750"," no matter what heading into uh the rest of this year because my my posit would be if we crash"
"12281750","12288530"," down below two four thousand in the Fed will continue to raise rates then four thousand is not the"
"12288530","12294130"," lowest that we're going to trade you would you're talking about uh not just a certified market"
"12294130","12300050"," crash just 10 percent over a few days or more uh within a few days so if you were to"
"12300050","12305610"," see not only that so you'd figure that this is going to be somewhere down here is the market uh"
"12305610","12312890"," selling off right but then the but then the rates right if the if the positive is no we're going"
"12312890","12319770"," to four thousand this time we're going to break below these previous lows on this run uh then"
"12319770","12324450"," you're saying something even more than that you're saying the market's going to crash uh coming up"
"12324450","12333610"," in the next week or so i'm interested to see what you think comments yesterday were we're striking"
"12333610","12341210"," i thought his comments yesterday uh piqued my interest because he point blank said no matter what i"
"12341210","12347110"," am committed to raising rates all of this year if that were the case and if there were the case"
"12347110","12352230"," that we traded down here right down here that you and that he could have possibly trigger a"
"12352230","12358450"," recession well that would then call for some type of a market crash type scenario he might have"
"12358450","12362510"," triggered that yesterday i'm not saying that that's going to happen or that i think that's going to"
"12362510","12368950"," happen uh but it's interesting to see today the amount of selling that we have down here and"
"12368950","12375830"," furthermore uh the deposit that we're going to trade lower than 420 uh so 420 seems like about the"
"12375830","12383010"," place where we'll liquidate the market but if people are calling for four thousand right now if"
"12383010","12387770"," they're calling for that four thousand then that would be what the case that you're making is that"
"12387770","12393590"," um that we're going to have a market crash now if we have a market crash in the fed we'll"
"12393590","12399050"," continue to raise rates in that scenario let me know in the chat because i'm interested in that and"
"12399050","12403730"," that positive interest in Jerome Powell's statement yesterday because it didn't quite rubby the"
"12403730","12411290"," wrong way it rubbed me the way that uh uh that instituting QE rubbed me because you're when you"
"12411290","12416310"," hear when you back in march point 20 in april when you heard the fed say uh we have the"
"12416310","12421330"," endless money printer and we'll do digitally and all that kind of stuff uh that infert the market"
"12421330","12425510"," was going to go to crazy fucking highs while they were pumping the market full of money and when"
"12425510","12433850"," Jerome and when the fed specifically does something it's usually uh a blunt instrument not not"
"12433850","12439790"," needed for uh not needed for the market so my question about that hold on one second i'm getting"
"12439790","12445510"," interrupted can you can you sign it face for a second read it uh oh hold on i'll send you"
"12445510","12450330"," send that all right uh don't worry about that i'll write that and tie it in just a minute so"
"12450330","12456890"," my let's say get some over here in a rant and my daughter's like excuse me daddy to make by"
"12456890","12464210"," my question question this positive is that just like the blunt instrument of QE is does the market"
"12464210","12469830"," react in kind uh to that statement yesterday that was a pretty fucking bold statement yesterday"
"12469830","12474490"," that the fed president made the fed president is basically telling you that he doesn't give a fuck"
"12474490","12480830"," where the market goes he doesn't give a fuck what happens he doesn't give up his first care is that"
"12480830","12486390"," we're in inflation he doesn't care if in mark if in march we peaked inflation and what that"
"12486390","12493430"," triggers is a market doesn't trigger a market crash and not only that trigger a recession full face"
"12493430","12500110"," forward if you get a market crash and you get rates matter of fact i'm reading this morning i'm"
"12500110","12506110"," reading this morning on trade the news they're saying that people are talking about a 75 bps rate"
"12506110","12515210"," increase in may uh not just aggressive which is fine not just aggressive but you're talking about"
"12515210","12519930"," liquidation in the stock market you're talking about aggressive rates over the coming months into"
"12519930","12526110"," the end of the year and you're seeing panic in the market right now this morning uh that statement"

"12528930","12535810"," guys to read the series of findings again right here real quick i'll reread this to you hold on"
"12535810","12545630"," here so you can find this and this was that the u.s."
"12546090","12551870"," indices opened sharply lower amid broad weakness in euro stocks right fed rate hike expectations"
"12551870","12557510"," continued to get ratcheted higher ahead of fomc officials quiet period to take effect next week"
"12557510","12564810"," futures markets are now pricing in 350 basis point heights and the next uh three consecutive fomc"
"12564810","12569410"," meeting minutes you know this is showing you in the market that the markets pricing this in right"
"12569410","12576270"," and while pundits have begun to talk up the possibility of a 75 bps move in may now i think"
"12576270","12582510"," that's just bluster but even so if the fed president says yesterday fuck you i don't care about"
"12582510","12587510"," where inflation is or if it's rolled over we're fucking raising rates my question to yesterday was"
"12587510","12595090"," does that does that in any way shape or form uh bring up the case for a market crash if"
"12595090","12600590"," we trade down to 420 and you're saying i've got 400 puts or 4000 puts in the market we're going"
"12600590","12607510"," there you see the 413 puts that came out today in the market the question becomes uh let me see"
"12607510","12612330"," if i get this right here question becomes do they price it in aggressively right it's priced in by"
"12612330","12618770"," the time we get there do we actually get some form of a market crash it would be interesting to"
"12618770","12624390"," see if we get that market crash down here in the coming days i don't think we do and i"
"12624390","12631730"," do think we tag out on this on this uh support line right here this trending support line which is"
"12631730","12639230"," down around two or four 18 uh excuse four one eight one point seven five for today specifically or"
"12639230","12644110"," tomorrow it could get higher as time goes forward but if we were to have that liquidation moment in"
"12644110","12648710"," the market this is all i see but some of you out there i can see in chat earlier today"
"12648710","12655910"," it posted that you see 4000 uh would say that i'm not against that i don't believe it's going to"
"12655910","12662010"," happen they're going to trade lower than 420 but if we were to uh that's a certified market crash"
"12662010","12667430"," you can call whatever you want that's a market crash uh and this would be in response to the fed"
"12667430","12673150"," uh president saying that fuck you no matter what and we've had these these we've had this happen in"
"12673150","12679950"," the past uh with fed commentary which just like uh we printed digitally we printed digitally was"
"12679950","12686790"," the inverse of that statement the absolute inverse was what j pau said yesterday it's the exact"
"12686790","12691950"," inverse fuck you i don't care this is what we're doing uh we know that the fed is always late"
"12691950","12695530"," to the party we always know that the fed is late but we saw the market sell off when he"
"12695530","12702010"," was late to the party instituting qe and he's late to the party now saying no matter what no matter"
"12702010","12710410"," what uh we are raising rates aggressively this year and i'm committed to that program until the end"
"12710410","12716270"," of this year regardless of if inflation is peak back in mark that statement was made yesterday and"
"12716270","12721270"," in turn uh from that statement to make sure there's risk advisors out there that are saying well"
"12721270","12726730"," shit he's telling you and that he's going to be honest about it and do we get that do we"
"12726730","12734810"," get that market crash over that scenario that's a huge question to be asking unknown at this point"
"12734810","12743050"," we are trading down at 4 29 95 we should expect over the weekend some sort of sell down to"
"12743050","12749070"," that 420 level we want to see that 420 level down we want to see that 420 level down on"
"12749070","12755370"," friday monday or the following friday monday what are the implications of a market a market"
"12755370","12760890"," liquidation event even if it's not crash just market liquidation if you see it this weekend let's"
"12760890","12767790"," say before now and monday what is the impact on the remaining big tech stocks heading into their"
"12767790","12774830"," er's what is the impact if it takes place after their er's we saw that tesla had given up all"
"12774830","12781730"," of its gains the following day uh from a pretty decent er right we talked about that this morning"
"12781730","12790790"," so that becomes the question leading into uh sweet thank you very much i appreciate it so that"
"12790790","12797910"," becomes so that becomes the question is what are we going to do uh as a market between now and"
"12797910","12803350"," whatever this liquidation takes place it doesn't matter if it's friday or this friday and monday it"
"12803350","12808910"," doesn't matter if it's next friday or next monday but it brings up a conversation as we head there"
"12808910","12816850"," so let's say from today in the next nine days right we start to head down to 420 right let's"
"12816850","12822490"," say we trade down to 420 this let's say we trade out a 420 next friday and saturday you've got"
"12822490","12828850"," doom and gloom in the news coming out you've got jpow committing himself to raising rates over the"
"12828850","12835030"," next uh year or so no matter what and there's no more fed put right now it's a fed call"
"12835030","12841090"," uh i don't know i don't know where i stand on that on that topic but that topic should be"
"12841090","12849110"," a topic of conversation amongst you over the next coming week as we trade down this market it"
"12849110","12857030"," should be a topic of conversation because you've got you've got to understand that you have to"
"12857030","12865590"," understand that they will price this in if it's true if if he's serious about no matter what right"
"12865590","12873150"," so think about that you could trade this down to 4000 and if he were to continue to raise rates"
"12873150","12882010"," down at 4000 after a technical market crash that's the key is that if you trade down to 4000 right"
"12882010","12887950"," and not that 420 in the next let's say this weekend or next weekend let's say we trade down to"
"12887950","12894650"," 420 right that's fine but if you're out there calling for 4000 right now that would be a market"
"12894650","12900310"," crash and on top of that you're telling me that the fucking fed president you're trying to tell me"
"12900310","12906410"," that the fucking Fred president Jerome fucking Powell is going to then come out on fucking on"
"12906410","12912550"," fucking May 4th and tell you oh by the way we threw another fucking 50 basis points on there you"
"12912550","12917790"," fucking explain i mean i'm not saying anything to happen i'm not saying anything to happen but i'll"
"12917790","12923750"," tell you what what we said yesterday while he was speaking while he was speaking i turned the"
"12923750","12928530"," volume down on it i said to you out there i said this is important and what makes it is"
"12928530","12937090"," important is him bolstering his position that no matter what no matter fucking what he was going to"
"12937090","12942870"," stay on the regime so if the market in turn crashes you tell me i want to know if the"
"12942870","12951410"," market crashes if we go down to 4000 in the coming week or two and he comes out on the"
"12951410","12958430"," fourth and says and we're just adding another 50 50 basis points we we fucked you again fuck your"
"12958430","12966390"," tesla fucking fuck your tesla shares we also just raised your fucking mortgage rates and by the way"
"12966390","12972150"," none of you can afford to buy a house anymore if he did that let's say it's an on May"
"12972150","12981050"," 4th directly after a market crash technical market crash so you're saying we're going to 4000 not"
"12981050","12986390"," 420 and you're saying that the fed president's going to come out on the fourth and tell you oh and"
"12986390","12991250"," by the way we just we just loaded you up with some more fucking uh some more interest rates what"
"12991250","12995230"," do you think the what do you think the reaction at that point would be that's my my question to"
"12995230","13002110"," you my positive my question to you is what is what is step two from there i'm not talking about"
"13002110","13010430"," a relief rally from 4000 i'm asking you like down the road down the road what happens after that"
"13010430","13016410"," that's my big question it's always it's always like what what is it six months or three months what"
"13016410","13022530"," are the implications of Jerome Powell actually falling through and this this would be the question"
"13022530","13028410"," about this would be the question about your your macro view on the market for the course of a year"
"13028410","13033090"," so let's look back on it real quick here let's bring it on to a year let's look at a"
"13033090","13040510"," year over here on the market right you know crazy that shit looks tough looking crazy that looks so"
"13040510","13048130"," you're pausing that we hit 4000 down here right and you're also going to have Jerome Powell who's"
"13048130","13054590"," going to not stop with the rates right and nor the talk of those of said rates right then that"
"13054590","13063930"," would open the door even on a recovery to at least giving back at least giving back everything"
"13063930","13073770"," that you made on that recovery back in 2020 which is way down"
"13073770","13080630"," here this is way down here at that 3600 this is way down here at 3200 and even if you"
"13080630","13089490"," trade down here just right now what he's basically said to you is I don't give a fuck right and"
"13089490","13096510"," not only do I not give a fuck I'm going to continue until you give it all back does that"
"13096510","13105710"," make sense way down there way down there at 3221 way down there at 3600 right do you stair step"
"13105710","13114950"," case lower until you give every last fucking dollar back that you gained down here"
"13114950","13121890"," right right where that is right there kind of intersects over here kind of funnily right 3600 3200"
"13121890","13130190"," could you handle this over the next nine months when does the fed put actually come into play is he"
"13130190","13136170"," fucking lying to you now that's another thing the fed president said I will be I'll be I'll be a"
"13136170","13142950"," transparent it's the new fed there'll be transparent right his statement yesterday was was pretty"
"13142950","13147990"," transparent so far right we're going to price that into the market do you think that the fed"
"13147990","13154430"," president will cry uncle before we get down to 32 or 3600 because I don't know that that's the"
"13154430","13164010"," that's the big question you can't get to 4000 from 420 in a market crash and not have the fed"
"13164010","13171130"," president react so if the fed president does not react to that market crash this is actually what"
"13171130","13179710"," takes place over time as you eventually end up giving it all back every single last bit of it was"
"13179710","13187390"," that a decent rant or no so that's the big question or at least that's my big question so I"
"13187390","13192510"," know people out there claiming 4000 if we do that in a few days if we did it even a"
"13192510","13197830"," week it would it would technically to some extent still be a market crash scenario which is"
"13197830","13202510"," interest I'm interested in that is already in a market crash scenario shit like this when that"
"13202510","13209890"," happens if you were to trade down to 4000 regardless if you traded down to 4000 you would you would"
"13209890","13214550"," have a congressional hearing with that I would assume so or I would assume there would be panic"
"13214550","13221390"," within within the markets and probably panic within parts of parts of the country as well as"
"13221390","13227050"," participants in the market you'd have you'd have that fear what could take place so when someone's"
"13227050","13233270"," calling for 4000 now I guess I'm just wondering do you know what that triggers if we hit 4000 now"
"13233270","13238430"," if we hit it next week if we hit it into half of them see what kind of an event"
"13238430","13243650"," does that trigger and it doesn't matter how you trade if the fed president commits to that regime"
"13243650","13255580"," you will more than likely give back everything that you've got for the last two years that's some"
"13255580","13260840"," crazy shit right there so if you're a bull what are you looking for here you're looking for a"
"13260840","13266520"," bounce down below in the coming week and a half or so at least off 420 if you don't see"
"13266520","13275280"," that if you don't see that bounce down below at 420 and you see us head down to 4000 in"
"13275280","13280820"," the next coming weeks right if you're gonna if you're gonna entertain the thought of 4000 the"
"13280820","13288240"," question becomes to you if you were to give back I would bet I would bet that if there I"
"13288240","13296680"," would bet that 90% of the furrows on Twitter and on on Twitter specifically 90% made all their"
"13296680","13304780"," money in those last two years all of it every last dollar that would I would posit that those guys"
"13304780","13310060"," made all of their money in 2020 some of it was made in 2019 I was showing you the rise"
"13310060","13314720"," of Tesla for those those kind of lead up to this from earlier this morning but I should try to"
"13314720","13322540"," show you guys a chart from Tesla back in late summer of 2019 and you had a 400% raise"
"13322540","13330700"," in Tesla that year you went we went from uh we went I went 400% in 2019 in Tesla"
"13330700","13336620"," and just that year right there so my positive to you my question to you out there is if you"
"13336620","13343500"," were along this market and driving a Lambo and with your million-dollar house and you were along"
"13343500","13350420"," this market since since uh at least 2020 let's call it the bottom of 2020 and you proceeded to give"
"13350420","13357020"," it give it away this year uh what kind of panic would that set off in this market if you"
"13357020","13362420"," had a if you had panic selling in this market uh forget a market crash of 10% or more"
"13362420","13369640"," and the Fed is telling you Jerome Powell is telling you that pluck you no matter what we're going"
"13369640","13373060"," to keep doing it for for you know until for the rest of this year at least at least the"
"13373060","13378520"," next three Fed meetings we're going to keep hitting you with 50 BPS 50 BPS 50 BPS uh the question"
"13378520","13383520"," becomes what implications does that have on our market is that the last time you'll see 10% decline"
"13383520","13388320"," in one year uh and if the Fed were to continue down that road my I think that you would"
"13388320","13395820"," see a decline down to 360 320 uh on the S&P 500 over the course of nine months or"
"13395820","13401760"," a year uh but I want to know from you what you think uh those people that are along this"
"13401760","13408960"," market would do if we hit 4,000 because if we do hit 4,000 and the Fed comes out"
"13408960","13414260"," at the Fed meeting and says yeah fuck yeah we're committed no matter what my assumption would be"
"13414260","13422100"," that you would see not just a recession sooner than later but you would see more market crashes"
"13422100","13429480"," than just that one you would it would literally take the Fed president coming out and saying to you"
"13429480","13435740"," uh no rate increases where we're holding them back so and so if they don't are you ready as a"
"13435740","13444060"," person out there let me know in comments are you can you weather a recession can you weather uh I'm"
"13444060","13448980"," assuming that I'm assuming if you're wealthy it not well it's half a middle class to weather it I'm"
"13448980","13453260"," assuming that if all of your money is not in the stock market you're gonna or if it is in"
"13453260","13457280"," the stock where you're gonna fuck and pull it out if you hit 4,000 I think you're gonna see"
"13457280","13465780"," a panic in the markets I'll call it that panic I think you'd see market panic if Jerome Powell uh"
"13465780","13470780"," so here's what I'll make a statement this is what I think will happen if you trade down to 4 "
"13470780","13480500",",000 between now and let's call it this FOMC and if Jerome Powell if Jerome"
"13480500","13487220"," Powell sticks with fuck you were raising rates in in May and they raise rates more on to the close"
"13487220","13492820"," of pitch rating in energy markets WTI crude futures 10194 now down about two and a quarter percent"
"13492820","13498420"," as the pressure in US equity markets continues with 90 minutes to go or probing fresh lows with the"
"13498420","13505540"," Dow down more than 800 points and the SB cash down 100 handles sorry I poured myself a drink 21 "
"13505540","13513140","% at 27.59 I did a little I did bourbon with an orange spritz and then I put some"
"13513140","13520220"," cherries in there and it's peach season so we did some sliced peaches soaked in bourbon a little"
"13520220","13528760"," bit of a a little bit of a pistachio cold and bitters so the question becomes what happens if you"
"13528760","13534900"," trade down to that 4,000 what happens if the Fed President says no raising rates and it looked like"
"13534900","13541120"," they were trying to massage or manage the market heading into the next next at least next election"
"13541120","13548000"," season so the question becomes maybe we're reverting back and he quoted Volcker back back on that"
"13548000","13552240"," speech yesterday he was at during the lunch and he was talking about Volcker and that's interesting"
"13552240","13559220"," because you might see that Volcker ask type market for the next year if you were to see that"
"13559220","13564500"," Volcker ask type market and regime for the next year you're talking about trading the market down"
"13564500","13572940"," heavily heavily if you're long this market let's say you're long tesla down to 100 bucks or 300 or"
"13572940","13581160"," 700 bucks there would be real risk off selling from people on this market especially that of 4,000"
"13581160","13587840"," with the Fed committing so this is well my positive would be this if you see us trade down to"
"13587840","13593520"," 4,000 between now and the FOMC or even the minutes if you see us trade down to 4,000"
"13593520","13599620"," if you see the Fed President commit still in those in the FOMC or in the minutes to no matter"
"13599620","13606800"," what we're fucking doing rates for the next year I think you're going to see a recession sooner"
"13606800","13612680"," than later you'll see a recession even if we're living it you'll see a declared recession and"
"13612680","13620920"," you'll see a super bear market much sooner I would call the next month to three months it would be"
"13620920","13628500"," violent and fast my next positive would be if we trade down to 4,000 between now and the FOMC"
"13628500","13636360"," meeting or minutes that you would see the Fed put reinstituted I think they would still try to stop"
"13636360","13642360"," a mark a second or third market crash but I would think that you would expect you would expect that"
"13642360","13651480"," if you trade is serious and he is still transparent if"
"13651480","13660440"," he's still transparent right then then I think you're going to see the market decline heavily over"
"13660440","13667920"," the course of a year but the thing part about this too is if he becomes dovish after this much"
"13667920","13672920"," of a decline then you know that you can't trust the Fed President to that point right you can't"
"13672920","13678120"," trust the Fed that they are actually lying that you can't trust anything that they say at that"
"13678120","13683180"," point they have lost their credibility but that last shred of credibility would go out the window"
"13683180","13688260"," at that point because there is a Fed put right you would see if we traded to 4,000 you"
"13688260","13696060"," would see a Fed put come into play down at 4,000 that's the anticipation but that's the positive"
"13696060","13701440"," that bulls make oh no if we trade down there and if we're already at 50 bps the Fed put"
"13701440","13707240"," will come out and I'm not sure about that that that commentary yesterday he looked just straight in"
"13707240","13713420"," the camera and basically said go fuck yourself bulls so I'm wondering if I'm wondering what you"
"13713420","13720380"," think out there if you think that we will trade to 4,000 between now and let's say the FOMCO"
"13720380","13726340"," pecs and the FOMC meeting minutes do you think that we'll trade down to 4,000 do you think that's"
"13726340","13731780"," on the table and do you think also some other questions that have out there do you think that the"
"13731780","13736400"," Fed put will come into play at that point and they'll say oh fuck no we're doomed or do you"
"13736400","13742920"," think we'll actually enter into a forced recession in the coming I would say coming one to three"
"13742920","13749860"," months if he's serious if he's serious about rating an inflation if he's serious about about"
"13749860","13757000"," hitting this head on I think your recession is not pushed out two years I think I think maybe maybe"
"13757000","13760880"," you got Biden maybe in the background you got Biden saying fuck that I'll just deal with it myself"
"13760880","13764500"," and I'm not going to get reelected so what do I fucking care I'm going to do it right now"
"13764500","13769800"," maybe he's done that maybe his inner circle said to him you never get reelected boss and we're not"
"13769800","13773500"," going to back you in the next election so you might as well you might as well eat the fucking"
"13773500","13779440"," bullet on this one which is possible Carter did it right you got to you got to think that Carter"
"13779440","13785860"," at least knew at some point that he wasn't going to get reelected with the economy and the shape"
"13785860","13791340"," that it was taxes taxes the way that they were and that you know that that's not saying Volcker"
"13791340","13797160"," wasn't awesome I think Volcker did a great job but the the political fallout from that being the"
"13797160","13803360"," man or the bag man you can see what happens right you lose the presidency over stuff like that but"
"13803360","13808440"," in the background you know these guys are power hungry like they have greed always on their mind"
"13808440","13815680"," now so this is an interesting development that if you can trade below 430 footwall if you've got"
"13815680","13823840"," puts being bought for 413 in May and June do we hit 4,000 do we trade not to 420"
"13823840","13841210"," but to 4,000 you see"
"13841210","13845610"," cap I really don't think they will shift they haven't and we basically wage an economic world war"
"13845610","13851310"," and Russia not even that stop the Fed yeah I think that they don't shift either or at least from"
"13851310","13856330"," that commentary yesterday when he was speaking yesterday I was I was quite taken aback and it"
"13856330","13863230"," didn't take it didn't take nothing but a split second for his commentary yesterday to what I when I"
"13863230","13868950"," heard it I was like whoa I was like his policy hasn't shifted I agree with that but his commitment"
"13868950","13877690"," to it now he's he stated he said you'll always know before what's going to happen which is a shift"
"13877690","13884610"," from the Fed and he reiterated yesterday which was important he said he said I've been told that"
"13884610","13889490"," inflation has rolled over since March he said I don't carry so I don't you know I just don't"
"13889490","13895270"," fucking care so we're going to keep raising rates in this regime that would imply that they're"
"13895270","13900770"," going to continue this year no matter what or at least the three five three five mings that's being"
"13900770","13908830"," priced in right now the 50 bps so that's my question is if he's not if he comes in if"
"13908830","13914850"," we trade down let's say we're trying to 4,000 we have a we have a technical market crash and"
"13914850","13920910"," then you have the Fed chair come out and say well we're going to raise rates more what is that"
"13920910","13926230"," implication I guess that's the dumb down watered or not watered down but the the reduced down"
"13926230","13933950"," question is if we get 4,000 and we get another rate hike in May to in my and my"
"13933950","13940830"," viewpoint I think that triggers a recession fast rather than you know holding it off or trying to"
"13940830","13946070"," fend it off for a year or six months or nine months to see if shortages go away and inflation"
"13946070","13953670"," comes down all the other fucking nonsense that they talk about yeah we have exactly we've got the"
"13953670","13963470"," midterms agreed isn't there still a Fed put yeah no I think that the Fed put is at 360 I"
"13963470","13967990"," think so I think when you look at that chart when you're looking at this chart here the Fed put"
"13967990","13975530"," I think is at 360 it's roughly it's roughly there this is 321 this is 360 right here but when"
"13975530","13980670"," do you get the Fed put right somewhere in this area it probably wouldn't be right at 360 it would"
"13980670","13986150"," probably be somewhere down in this vicinity yeah you would get the Fed put here but you would also"
"13986150","13991470"," get that rollover you get that you get those Fed interest rates right if you had 4,000 and the"
"13991470","13996970"," Fed says fuck you were doing you'd still see the one the two and the three there's your Fed rates"
"13996970","14003230"," heading into March 2023 right or somewhere they might might be might have my my my crayon drugs"
"14003230","14009710"," might not be perfect my time might not be perfect right maybe it's somewhere in here right November"
"14009710","14016430"," boom quick slip down into the new year and there you go you're below your 360 and then you get"
"14016430","14022290"," the Fed put ticking right which is much lower but my question I guess in this positive is are you"
"14022290","14028670"," prepared are you prepared for at least two things to happen if you're long this market because I"
"14028670","14032990"," hear I see people on Twitter all the time they're always like oh I've been in Tesla since fucking"
"14032990","14038170"," it was like 90 bucks my dollar cost I'm using Tesla's example it doesn't matter it could be Apple"
"14038170","14045410"," my dollar cost average on stock Z was $30 my question is what if you woke up in December and"
"14045410","14050870"," January and you didn't sell your positions and you found out that you'd given back everything that"
"14050870","14058110"," you did gained in in the in the last two years right I guess not the last few years not"
"14058110","14065510"," this year if you had given all this back and you wound up sitting down here somewhere and you're"
"14065510","14072110"," now back to zero what would you what would you do like well and then and then if you start"
"14072110","14077250"," to see jobs dry up and you start to see wage that inflation and you're paying for a house that's"
"14077250","14081210"," not worth five hundred thousand dollars or more million dollars let's say your million dollar home"
"14081210","14086310"," is now worth five hundred thousand dollars let's say your job prospects have gotten become lower"
"14086310","14094850"," your pay has become lower and your once grand portfolio is now reduced to two years of nothingness"
"14094850","14104070"," let's answer that question could you whether that's storm into end of year as the fed is is"
"14104070","14111150"," basically to an extent warning of that taking place between now and end of year so take a look"
"14111150","14116030"," around at your house and say hey I own a path million dollar home if I lost my job let's"
"14116030","14119970"," say I make a hundred twenty grand let's say I make ninety thousand as an engineer right now can I"
"14119970","14126150"," take a job at sixty thousand dollars as an engineer if they cut my position or my project could my"
"14126150","14135390"," portfolio go back down to what it once was two years ago three years ago can I afford my house"
"14135390","14142210"," do I want to stay in this neighborhood until that house comes back in value can I afford the"

"14147010","14153010"," wife can my wife stay home can my wife stay home and drink martinis and chomp what else what else"
"14153010","14158910"," what's the joke about the station this is that's kind of to massage it's misogynistic but oh my"
"14158910","14165390"," husband can my husband stay at home and drink martinis and chew on chew on quailudes while I'm off"
"14165390","14172130"," of work you'll can that all happen and I wonder about that question because of what he said"
"14172130","14177890"," yesterday that you didn't grind on me yesterday but his commitment to it the market is pricing it"
"14177890","14183350"," in right now and there's a positive that we're going to four thousand and if we do go to four"
"14183350","14188730"," thousand that's a market crash if we go to it the next week or two that's a market crash if"
"14188730","14195410"," we go to it in four weeks it's kind of a market crash kind of a market crash even if"
"14195410","14200650"," it takes four weeks kind of a market crash we head down to four thousand so this is just a"
"14200650","14208630"," theoretical mind kind of exercise and not only that it still stays with does the fed speaker"
"14208630","14214750"," commitment he has he said he'll be he said he'll be upfront and honest about everything and he"
"14214750","14221630"," seems to be saying that so that's my question too can you handle this over the course of let's say"
"14221630","14227170"," at nine months to a year can you handle that downward move in the next year and the funny part"
"14227170","14231270"," about this too is if we were to trade down at four thousand who would still have that huge swing"
"14231270","14235930"," high again and you'd have a bull saying never or never it's not going to happen and then boom we're"
"14235930","14239790"," down at three eighty right and the bull say no no it's never going to happen again and then boom"
"14239790","14244430"," we're down to three sixty and then boom we're down below three sixty I don't think we get that low"
"14244430","14251190"," maybe here three sixty is a price target if the fed is committed but that's it's an interesting"
"14251190","14261030"," positive it's it's an interesting question of will that happen will will the will"
"14261030","14267830"," the market trade not down at four twenty will trade down to actually four hundred or four thousand"
"14267830","14274630"," the implications of that you have a certified market crash you have a certified market crash and"
"14274630","14280990"," you'd have you'd be looking towards the fed president to pull not raise rates right that would be"
"14280990","14285690"," the the demand is that they're not going to raise rates but if you said fuck you note we're we're"
"14285690","14292830"," sticking with our program I'm assuming not assuming I shouldn't say assuming that you'd be trick"
"14292830","14300210"," you would trigger a recession much faster than it would accelerate you're talking about an accepted"
"14300210","14307370"," you would say hey we're in a recession you have news organizations calling that are calling over in"
"14307370","14314170"," a recession before not not a year or two but you hear that statement by end of year this year"
"14314170","14320550"," next did this next one to three months that were were coming into a recession which is fascinating"
"14320550","14327490"," because we're not there yet but the implication is that we could be there and furthermore if we"
"14327490","14332550"," were to see news programs in the coming week or ten days let's say the stock market just crashed"
"14332550","14341710"," right we haven't seen that headline in two years two years no no no hey the stock market crashed"
"14341710","14348570"," we've seen you know correction we got a correction but not stock market crash so as we trade and"
"14348570","14355390"," liquidate the market lower at 427 34 we're looking to still stay on track here head down heading"
"14355390","14362650"," down to the bell to 423 31 but the question becomes if we liquidate the market down to 420 which"
"14362650","14368550"," is not that far away right we're right down here 420 you can probably expect that liquidation in"
"14368550","14374230"," the next couple days or next weekend but there are some calling for 4,000 if you if you do"
"14374230","14384470"," get 4,000 that is a technical market crash technical market crash interesting what"
"14384470","14391010"," else are you guys saying up here let's see what else you guys are saying here mr."
"14391270","14400430"," somebody a commentary oh let's see you guys are saying i'm missing somebody you guys are saying"
"14404090","14409930"," Biden is 79 years old today i didn't know that so you guys are saying here we scroll back up"
"14413950","14423320"," let's see man the fed put could come but it will come too late yeah that's uh that's what i'm"
"14423320","14431280"," pausing there tom is that it comes too late right is that you've got oh you've got over stimulating"
"14431280","14441140"," with kiwi let me see i really don't think they will shift they haven't don't forget we have mid"
"14441140","14448420"," terms yet we have midterms this year fed put to come out uh could come but it would come too"
"14448420","14454200"," late just like corrective measures for inflation are coming too late yeah absolutely they're always"
"14454200","14459120"," late to the party and they always overreact right it was it was kind of hilarious yesterday"
"14459120","14467920"," watching it was kind of hilarious yesterday watching um watching uh j pauce say specifically well"
"14467920","14474900"," we can see that inflation is is rolling over that we've hit peak inflation and he said i don't care"
"14474900","14480840"," and i was like man i was like that's the same thing that they did in march 2020 they they"
"14480840","14486920"," they over did it and he's specifically saying we're over he's basically admitting uh that no matter"
"14486920","14491420"," what if they don't care if they go over i don't think we go to 4,000 my next week"
"14491420","14495860"," Ted and saying no i don't either i i don't i'm not saying that we're going to 4,000 i"
"14495860","14501620"," know that there are people out there saying we are and i'm just trying to just trying to uh look"
"14501620","14506660"," at the implications of 4,000 i'm not on the boat that we're going to 4,000 if you want"
"14506660","14511840"," to know i think we trade out of 420 we we trade up uh either this weekend or next weekend"
"14511840","14519600"," but if on the tail risk side of things we trade down to 4,000 in the next even now"
"14519600","14527800"," to fmc minutes or meeting uh it does trigger a bunch of other questions it triggers what is the fed"
"14527800","14534120"," going to do it triggers if the fed is lying right now but by saying we don't have a fed"
"14534120","14540320"," but we have a fed we have a fed call right now uh so that that's my my posit i"
"14540320","14544500"," think that power has occurred employment until 2028 he doesn't give a fuck yeah that would be kind"
"14544500","14549160"," of cool to see uh he has said the past that he does look up to Volker and he wants"
"14549160","14553720"," to be remembered Volker is looked back upon as one of the greatest fed fed presidents we've had"
"14553720","14559940"," maybe he does want to keep that uh maybe he wants to keep that that or pass that torch on"
"14559940","14566620"," to himself where he can say look i saved the market from covid and then i saved us from the"
"14566620","14573610"," greatest depression that ever could hit us a lot depends on if inflation is peaked or not jade is"
"14573610","14578950"," saying it's interesting he said yesterday uh that we have with that we have data saying that"
"14578950","14585790"," inflation has peaked he spoke he said that yesterday they're going to pump it into the last hour in"
"14585790","14591610"," closed shorts capped by his way tool do another round i agree with that looks like market breath"
"14591610","14598090"," works in recession checked weekly uh market breath works in recession yes it does uh the market"
"14598090","14603570"," breath does work in recession somebody's looked gross but coming close to big levels Biden is 79"
"14603570","14611870"," years old today that's crazy i've got uh my my my wife's uh grandmother died at 78 and some change"
"14613350","14621080"," um and i wouldn't want her running running our country see yeah i could go but just because there's"
"14621080","14625440"," a big gap there in the volume profile i don't think it will happen over a few days if it"
"14625440","14629880"," does and the fed could definitely do the put um yeah it's my question is does he do the put"
"14629880","14635940"," if that happens uh but he would lose credibility too right if he did the put just you're like one"
"14635940","14641460"," week ago you said that we're not doing the fed put now this week you are or even a month"
"14641460","14646760"," legacy is a big deal in life yeah i agree with that after a couple huge down days like does"
"14646760","14651400"," the fed usually tries to watch back there comes i agree with that and you'll have j how now"
"14651400","14656060"," clarifying what he means yeah i agree with that that Lee uh i'm on that i'm bored i don't think"
"14656060","14661460"," we go to 4 000 uh but i i know there are people out there calling for 4 000 and"
"14661460","14666300"," so i'm saying to you or anyone else out there that is calling 4 000 these are the implications if"
"14666300","14673220"," we do go to 4 000 Biden doesn't have to care about reelection so he can freely push wealth"
"14673220","14678840"," distribution of agenda yeah that's you know i was wondering about that statement i were about your"

"15849570","15856090"," the downward trajectory and keep the expansion going it's fevery 22nd or excuse me april 22nd right"
"15856090","15864030"," and a month out would be may so we'll generate just a month trade and we'll look currently where we"

"15947220","15959130"," even go that high so 438"
"15959130","15968970"," 436 now you wouldn't take this 438 436 probably back in may i might make this a close closer"
"15968970","15978130"," dated that's a hundred percent gain for may 23rd so we wouldn't be at 436 on may 23rd i don't"
"15978130","15984190"," think that we would be at 436 on may 23rd so let's just pretend that this is a trade that"

"16593560","16601540"," followers all they do is they buy calls and puts or they buy just stock and so you're not teaching"
"16601540","16607279"," a ratio spread to a new trainer who's never traded a spread before this is why we're running it on"
"16607279","16611360"," robinhood i wouldn't run it on robinhood if i was talking to some of them know what they were doing"
"16611360","16620060"," we'd be running it on tasty this is for new traders"
"16620060","16629950"," or traders that don't have no fucking clue what they're doing you're right over there this"
"16632150","16638189"," is for the new trader that's out there so if you're a new trader right and you're probably i'm"

"16723130","16728009"," them for protection often i like put back spreads right that's a ratio that's a put ratio spread"
"16728009","16736500"," that pays you even if it doesn't print right over time it pays you no matter what we've talked"

"17383640","17390340"," going down the calls are increasing in price and so as we have that liquidation moment we haven't"
"17390340","17395620"," had it yet believe it or not or if even if this is a minor liquidation we'll have a major"
"17395620","17402540"," one uh at some point and so if we have this major liquidation moment in the market it doesn't"
"17402540","17406900"," matter the price doesn't matter uh you'll see the price of dirt keep calls and they'll start to"

"17425620","17433400"," you see that violent move right here to close but then it went down again right down here you see"
"17433400","17441540"," that down there this is the liquidation part of it it's like that last asset mass selling now i"
"17441540","17446940"," don't think this is a good example but this is a better example down here right here boom and you"
"17446940","17454010"," just buy that shit and it just rockets um so we're not there quite yet this is a good one"
"17454010","17466670"," this is real good this is definitely by the debt and i'll buy"

"17522350","17528430"," reason for this too right there's a technical reason for this that they have to buy this they don't"
"17528430","17535190"," have a fucking choice they have to and so you go in with uh you know i wouldn't go in"
"17535190","17542190"," with your whole account but i would go in with uh you know pretty you know pretty big some of"
"17542190","17545370"," you guys don't have a large enough account to go all that way you know your small accounts you have"

"17578810","17585050"," was january 24th i think it was the 24th or it was 23rd whatever that was this day or day"
"17585050","17590450"," before look up then now as janell's are black and they were like well we bought the market and they"

"17610570","17615230"," so you're following the banks in that trade now there are better trades to make down here uh there"
"17615230","17625400"," are more risky trades there are ways that you see right here this is he this right here hello you"

"17653400","17659700"," side by just shy of a billion and managing and knowing when to pull the trigger of that trade is"
