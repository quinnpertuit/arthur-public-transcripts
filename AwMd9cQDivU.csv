"6720","10870"," I have to see where that comes"
"14040","22520"," down."
"22520","36980"," Three days ago."
"38000","38440"," Okay. "
"38880","40040"," Good morning, everybody."
"41560","46880"," Good morning, Gerald, John, M.A., Ben Godfrey, Fisted, Philip, Binky, or Binky, good morning."
"50680","51480"," How's everybody doing?"
"52320","56260"," All right, so I'm a little bit late this morning, so I'm going to get into this pretty fast. "
"58900","59800"," Good morning, everybody."
"60160","60640"," How's everybody doing?"
"61820","67180"," So yesterday and the day we were talking about in the live stream and the day we were talking about"
"67180","73720"," what a cashback or a cash gap fill is or how we typically when we trade up like we did"
"73720","77580"," in the close yesterday that we'll trade back down to cover that gap."
"78340","81380"," It does look like we're doing that this morning right into the open. "
"82080","92020"," We could slide down to 461.71. I want you to put a dotted support line at"
"92020","95140"," 461.71 on the spy."
"95140","105100"," I want you to put another one down below at 457.91, and believe it or not,"
"105360","115140"," 456.60. So I don't expect, we are kind of closing that gap this morning on the open."
"115580","120980"," We could green bar it straight up, but it looks like what we're going to do is more like a"
"120980","121520"," wait and see. "
"121760","122460"," I'm going to get quickly."
"122700","124220"," We're just quickly in the charts for you."
"124220","129639"," I want to show you the spy before the open as I talk about what to expect today, but I"
"129639","130960"," want you to see this right here. "
"130960","134980"," This relates as well to spy."
"135660","143380"," You can do a chart like this, but I want you to see is right here, and this is this"
"143380","150760"," morning as we open and you'll see this snapback that we did yesterday and the overnight we climbed"
"150760","155080"," higher here, and we're just sliding back down to yesterday's close."
"155540","161680"," Okay, so just be aware of these levels like 465.675. We could find a reaction right off the bell"
"161680","167140"," will open up book map and see if there's support right off the bell to go higher. "
"167840","177000"," If not, we'll look for the supply zones below, and you're going to expect those at 462.275 and then"
"177000","179820"," again down below here at 458650."
"180680","182520"," Don't be surprised if we trade down here again."
"183000","187860"," It's not abnormal to recheck one more time before a real true blast off. "
"188420","190720"," That check could happen right here on the bell."
"190840","193300"," It could happen slightly lower, or we could even trade lower."
"193500","194680"," We could even trade down here. "
"195120","199780"," We could trade off this 4600, believe it or not, and then make a larger move higher."
"200180","203960"," We do have volatility today, so any of this right here is not to be unexpected."
"204860","209560"," We could green bar it off the open as well, both that came out this morning and threw a little"
"209560","211920"," bit of water on the Fed's dance today. "
"212360","218840"," We know we had the Fed come out, or we know that we got the written transcript yesterday from J "
"218840","221460","-POW, but that's not really where the volatility comes in."
"221520","227200"," More or less comes in from the question and answer part of the event, and I've seen these events in"
"227200","227520"," the past."
"227520","232800"," We either sell off heavy, or we rip much, much higher. "
"233560","239780"," There are some price targets out there at 4750, but if we get above 4700, right, and this"
"239780","245060"," volatility trigger here at 4714, this is a very bullish sign if we trade up here, okay?"
"245480","250420"," I want you to realize that even if it turns, even if the VANA rally is over and it takes"
"250420","254580"," us another week to trade higher, just be aware of that as we trade forward."
"254580","259500"," One of the best plays that you can do today is probably some sort of a spread, I might even"
"259500","265660"," wait to, not a spread, I straddle, but I might wait until just before the 10am hour, because what"
"265660","271160"," you'll see is typically as you'll see us trade slightly down in sideways, into that event, you'll"
"271160","273760"," get the best pricing as we trade into that event."
"273960","279640"," You could even possibly put the put side on right now as we trade into that event, and then you"
"279640","284060"," put the call side on just that, maybe a half an hour before it starts, that's 930 this morning,"
"284180","284340"," right?"
"284680","286580"," So right at 930, maybe we start this. "
"288220","290180"," The Fed's really not getting that hawkish."
"291680","293540"," They are and they are not."
"294120","296860"," They are getting hawkish and they are not getting hawkish. "
"297080","301820"," Bostik saying he wants three to four rate hikes this year, he's not a Fed president."
"302840","310940"," He is more like the, you want to always look at, if Bostik was bullish, you would expect Fed Chair"
"310940","318580"," Powell to be bearish, if they work off each other, so you're going to actually expect Jay Powell to"
"318580","322000"," be bullish in the context of the money flow."
"322900","326840"," As long as the money flow doesn't stop, you guys got to look at this, I only got eight minutes"
"326840","332620"," up, but you got, I want you guys to understand some, that there is money flow that comes into the"
"332620","337500"," system, okay, and pretend it's like a bathtub, I've said this before, it's like a bathtub, right?"
"338840","344100"," And what you want to see them do, or at least explain what they're going to do, and not that"
"344100","351100"," the Fed really influences inflation or the price of goods or any of this stuff, or even the price"
"351100","352200"," of the market, they don't. "
"352560","359500"," But what you want to think about is like a bathtub with money flowing into it, right?"
"359620","360240"," There's a spigot."
"361020","365560"," And if they're plugging the tub, that pumps the market."
"365560","370080"," If they pull the plug in the tub, right, it drains the market at a controlled rate. "
"370240","372080"," They're plugging it, pulling it, plugging it, pulling it."
"373240","379980"," Now if they turn the money, the spigot off completely, that's when you get super hella bearish,"
"380440","380780"," okay?"
"381200","385320"," Now if they're going to turn the water down a little bit, open the plug up, and as long as"
"385320","391800"," you still have slight money flow, the market will still function, even if the money is draining out"
"391800","392500"," of the bathtub."
"393380","395180"," And that's really what you're looking for. "
"395300","398140"," You're really looking for hardness on QT to sell the market."
"398500","401220"," Now do I think this market sells down this year, or next year?"
"401480","401760"," Absolutely."
"402420","403760"," I'm full on bear at this time. "
"404760","407200"," Do I think that we need to put collars on?"
"407340","411280"," Do I think that we need to put spreads on, put back spreads on?"
"411520","411680"," Absolutely."
"412960","415000"," I know a ton of you out there don't even have them on yet."
"415420","416700"," So where do you want to put them on?"
"417120","420940"," I know that there's a ton of bulls out there that don't think we're going to 500, and I don't"
"420940","421740"," think we are either. "
"422920","425580"," But do I think that I want to trade higher to put a collar on?"
"425900","429000"," Or do I think that I want to, I know that there are bulls out there that just want us"
"429000","431000"," to trade higher just so they can get out of their calls."
"431860","437040"," So and you saw yesterday, MS, you saw Mike Wilson come out yesterday and say, we might only drop"
"437040","439340"," another, another one percent this year."
"439620","444900"," You saw JPM saying, no, no, no, no, see at this battle of the mines and the big banks about"
"444900","446320"," what we're doing and where we're going. "
"446760","451120"," I saw hedge funds coming out yesterday on CNBC, talking about how we're going to, you know, burn,"
"451120","456240"," burn overnight, because they probably were probably short all day long yesterday and got caught up"
"456240","460780"," in it, smaller, smaller hedge funds probably got caught yesterday and drank the Kool-Aid."
"461820","466440"," So I just want you guys to be aware or be conscious of where we are on the market."
"466760","468960"," We always trade that's what's in front of us to the right. "
"469520","470480"," We'll trade that as well today."
"470640","471640"," I can't tell you where we're going."
"471900","474240"," I'm telling you to do a straddle because we could go either way today. "
"474780","476740"," No one's going to tell you out there which way we're going today."
"477580","481960"," If we do end up trading up, I want you guys to think about putting on some kind of a"
"481960","482580"," put back spread."
"483020","484060"," I posted it on Twitter. "
"484540","485020"," It's free."
"485680","486220"," It's free."
"486700","490140"," I actually have some other charts I'm going to show you at some point today if there's a low. "
"490720","495160"," I want to show you how I want to show you in the past how they've worked out in 2007"
"495160","502400"," and 2008, how they worked out in 2018, how it worked out in 2020 and 2019, so that you can"
"502400","507640"," measure yourself into that kind of a hedge to protect yourself, protect your investments and you"
"507640","511640"," actually can take this market long with easy protection, okay?"
"512039","513179"," It doesn't cost you a dime."
"514580","516400"," Now I'm not bullish into today."
"516620","522220"," How we're opening right now this morning, not bullish at all, but I want you to trade the market"
"522220","522960"," that's in front of you. "
"523020","525700"," It's critical that you do that because you can lose your shirt."
"526020","527060"," You can lose your shirt as a bull."
"527400","529020"," You can lose your shirt as a bear, right?"
"529620","536660"," Yesterday, I told you to take your money and run at the bell yesterday and lo and behold, you. "
"537600","538000"," Yeah."
"538200","539340"," So I'm bullish from bearish."
"539340","540140"," I can switch it a dime. "
"540700","543880"," I want you guys to be open though to both of those scenarios."
"544240","547420"," My expectation off the bell this morning is that we're going to trade slightly down."
"548160","551120"," We could possibly try to close some of this up from yesterday. "
"551440","556440"," I wouldn't be surprised to see this close up at least 4623 off the bell."
"556960","562400"," We could take some put protection here and then I would immediately at the 10 AM hour or close to"
"562400","567560"," 10 AM grab some calls for the ride up the elevator up."
"568980","570280"," Be careful of this today. "
"570440","571020"," I'm going to talk."
"571180","578000"," I'm going to get past all this so that we can talk about some like Volcker in the past, you"
"578000","581220"," know, about taxation, about rate increases."
"581860","588880"," There's like real impacts on inflation and then there's the fake impacts on inflation. "
"588880","590820"," So we're going to talk about that later on this morning."
"592040","596880"," I wanted to show you this just as we open and then you know what the calendar is this morning."
"597040","598900"," You know we had both to come out. "
"599000","602740"," I think it's six AM his prepared comments were released at six AM this morning."
"603940","608100"," You had a Loretta come out and that's their come out, but in reality, you're looking for J."
"608240","608360"," Pow."
"609000","609980"," That's who you're looking for. "
"610260","614220"," And seeing James Bullard coming out at four p.m. is a question mark for me as well."
"614220","616800"," Is this the soft and the blow maybe from J."
"616980","618480"," Pow getting uber ultra hawkish?"
"618800","623400"," No one knows what he's going to be today except for his prepared comments, which we're not hawkish."
"624600","628240"," They seemed hawkish until you read through the, through the thinness of it. "
"628480","630220"," He said that they're prepared to use their tools."
"630780","634600"," As long as he says, I am prepared to use my tools."
"635340","639900"," That means that they're going to step in anytime that we trade too low. "
"639900","645660"," That means that we have a defined bottom in this market this year, unless something changes."
"646120","650300"," Read the exact verbiage of what his prepared marks remarks are for today."
"651480","655880"," And my belief is that someone got a hold of those remarks yesterday at the three o'clock hour. "
"656200","659400"," And once they read that he's prepared to use his tools, right?"
"659900","661760"," That means QT is is not on."
"662180","667700"," That means that he's willing to spend money period and that's clear as day in my mind at this"
"667700","667980"," point."
"667980","673220"," Do we trade down our sideways all year long possibly, but until that man or any Fed president says"
"673220","677340"," that they will not use their tools, they're going to let the market just run. "
"678280","679960"," I'm sorry, there's a defined bottom."
"680500","681920"," They will pump, pump, pump."
"682320","683180"," They pumped in 2020. "
"683720","685400"," They pumped in 2008, right?"
"685600","686080"," We know this."
"688500","694740"," Yeah, I'm shocked that he said that yesterday, but by the way, they use those words specifically to"
"694740","700620"," key you in to the fact that they're not doing QT at this point, okay, or at least at that"
"700620","700820"," point."
"700920","701700"," Why do you guys understand that?"
"701800","703240"," It's 928. "
"703700","705060"," We're going to bring up the book map right away."
"705580","706740"," I'm not going to stick around on this page."
"706960","712440"," I also had a, I also had think or swim up for you because there is some concern here. "
"712500","716900"," When you guys see this right here, this is a 10 day chart in the 15 minute and we can"
"716900","718520"," easily slide down this morning."
"719120","720940"," No big deal for us to slide down this morning."
"721320","725720"," There's nothing holding us up where we are right now would not shock me to see us trade down off"
"725720","729900"," the bell and then have a face rep or rally to 4750. "
"730240","731640"," So just be real nimble today."
"731960","737680"," I want you guys to be able to switch sides at a moment's notice."
"738020","742100"," If you're not able to switch sides at a moment's notice, I might recommend that you stick out this"
"742100","742380"," morning. "
"742680","745640"," I don't care if you're a bull or a bear because things can get wild."
"746100","750640"," You can get stuck at a conviction of where we're going and it'll turn on you in a heartbeat and"
"750640","751360"," you lose all your money."
"752480","755780"," So just be conscious of that this morning as we head forward. "
"756140","760280"," I also want you to be conscious of, I also want you to be conscious of that meeting."
"760740","765460"," What happens oftentimes is the meeting will start, the confirmation will start and we'll get"
"765460","766040"," complacent."
"766180","767160"," It'll be like, oh, this is boring. "
"767340","771660"," We're not going to pay attention in the longer and then like an hour into it, you hear some senator"
"771660","776840"," freak out and say something and the market reacts and we head down, even if we're ripping higher."
"777680","778700"," So just be nimble this morning."
"778700","782920"," It's very critical to pay attention to the moves in the market as you move forward. "
"783560","789360"," We're going to track book map exclusively because we'll be able to see where the supply side buy"
"789360","791760"," and sell side is this morning when we open."
"799640","804600"," Yeah, I've heard, I've heard these bull, I've heard these bears, these little fed presidents."
"805740","811240"," I've heard these guys be bearish all year long and then all of a sudden come out of nowhere and"
"811240","812140"," they're bullish, right?"
"812400","814280"," So they throw a wrench right inside the program. "
"815740","820560"," You get caught with your pants down and you're like, wait a minute, I was expecting, I was"
"820560","822720"," expecting bull would be a bear today, right?"
"822820","826540"," It's been a bear all year long and then I think last fall, as a matter of fact, bow stick"
"826540","827480"," got bullish."
"827980","828640"," Bow stick or bull."
"828780","829540"," I can't remember which one. "
"830460","832260"," Or maybe it was the blonde guy that just quit."
"832820","837000"," He was bearish for years and then all of a sudden this fall, they find out that he was trading"
"837000","840400"," the stock market and then he comes out all kinds of bullish, right?"
"841120","844180"," Totally, totally like turning his back on bears, right?"
"844500","851920"," One of the bear, the same little fed presidents out there and sure enough, he turned himself"
"851920","852340"," around."
"852580","853880"," So I think they get pressed. "
"854160","857760"," I think that Fed Chair Powell just says, hey, you're going to do this, right?"
"859000","862260"," You're going to be the bear today, you're going to be the bull today and I'm going to tell you"
"862260","863780"," what you're going to be or we're going to, we're going to remove you."
"864720","866980"," And that's how they cleaned house in my view, too."
"867460","874380"," They ended up cleaning the house on the end of cleaning the house this year on little fed"
"874380","876220"," presidents that didn't want to do what they were told. "
"876680","879960"," And we are trading down right off the bell this morning, as expected."
"880240","882100"," We should close that gap from the prior day."
"882440","889080"," We're going to take a look right now and see the trade, how far we're going to trade down here"
"889080","889640"," right off the bell. "
"890860","892620"," We'll see where actual support is."
"899450","900270"," Good morning, everybody."
"900670","901430"," Hope you're all doing well. "
"901810","903110"," Hope the bull has made some money yesterday."
"903110","904530"," Hope the bear has made some money yesterday."
"905090","908230"," Everybody should have somewhat fat, fat accounts. "
"908790","912650"," Hopefully Chase is still money gripping his puts from yesterday so he can make a little bit of"
"912650","912850"," money."
"913870","915010"," Morning, Quinn, how are you?"
"915710","916290"," Morning of VSCU."
"916310","916830"," Good morning, Bee. "
"917010","917710"," Good morning, Winkyface."
"917890","919910"," Good morning, Chris, Alex, Doughboy Capital."
"920570","921210"," Your wife's boyfriend. "
"921570","922690"," Good morning to everybody out there."
"925770","927250"," Is Chase in here this morning?"
"927250","928510"," I hope he's doing well this morning."
"929590","930950"," Good morning, YJP. "
"931190","931690"," Good morning, Josh."
"931970","932930"," Good morning, Willie Smoke Meat."
"933550","937490"," Good morning, Johnny Rev. Good morning, Angie, M.A., Winkyface. "

"956510","956710"," Robert."
"957050","957530"," Good morning. "
"958590","960150"," All right, everybody's here this morning."
"961510","963450"," All right, so we're going to check this out right off the bell."
"963830","965770"," As expected, we are trading down slightly. "
"966150","967710"," We have a little bit of support here."
"967910","971310"," Four, six, four, nine, or four, six, three, nine, eight."
"975180","977440"," Maybe we dip slightly more right off the bell here. "
"978000","979860"," You see these buyers stepping in."
"979860","981200"," I want you guys to see this, right?"
"981640","983500"," 37, 37, or 3."
"983940","984660"," What do we got?"
"984860","989960"," 370,000 buyers to 338 sellers."
"990340","992480"," But the hero indicator is slightly negative. "
"993000","995020"," So open up your options chain, right?"
"998280","1000080"," And I'll open up alongside you guys."
"1007150","1009170"," And it never feels to amaze me."
"1010030","1017250"," In the background of my mind, I'm constantly thinking about the previous years. "
"1017530","1022650"," I'm constantly thinking about, you know, I used to be a bear, right?"
"1023109","1029430"," And what I have to remember is that they trade this market until they break it."
"1030630","1037069"," Just when you think that they're going to do something reasonable and rational that they're going"
"1037069","1042650"," to somehow tame the market, tame the economy, that's their intent."
"1043150","1048390"," You go and you read the comments from Jay Powell last night and you think to yourself, wait a"
"1048390","1050890"," minute, these guys are going to run this up until they break it again, right?"
"1051870","1052710"," It's what they do. "
"1053210","1059070"," They run it and they juice it and they suck it and they squeeze it until they break it."
"1060510","1062690"," The sellers from yesterday stepped back in."
"1062850","1063810"," They're back here this morning. "
"1064030","1065990"," They're at 4, 6, 6, 5, 7."
"1066110","1067130"," There's a wall at this point."
"1071030","1072570"," But it never shocks me."
"1072830","1074330"," It shouldn't shock you. "
"1074730","1077910"," And if you really do believe in the bear thesis, what are they going to do?"
"1077950","1082910"," You really think that they're going to trade us sideways for a year or two."
"1084870","1087990"," That they're going to then allow the market to go up."
"1089230","1090550"," They're going to yank all their money. "
"1090630","1092470"," They're going to liquidate the markets, what they're going to do, right?"
"1093970","1096470"," And they even continued their liquidation yesterday."
"1096470","1101910"," I was looking in Finviz last night, trying to look to see, even though the market was going up,"
"1101990","1103270"," what was taking place in the background."
"1103930","1107530"," And we still had liquidation in large portions of the market. "
"1108170","1109510"," So that's concerning, right?"
"1110050","1112570"," Are they dumping this market completely but not telling us?"
"1113870","1116510"," Are they going to just run it up to all time highs?"
"1116930","1124430"," Someone, yesterday, I reposted this on my Twitter handle, but one of these CFA's out there noted"
"1124430","1130530"," that the move that we made yesterday has only been made 30 times in the history of the stock market"
"1130530","1141070"," and like 13 of those, where most of them had happened in the years of the dot com bubble, that"
"1141070","1145190"," the run up to 2007, 2008, the crash, right?"
"1145950","1151330"," From 2000 into 2003 or something, we had these same movements."
"1152030","1157410"," So are we in this point of the market where we're going to scream to stupid all time highs, go"
"1157410","1159810"," straight vertical bars up, right?"
"1159950","1167330"," Or have violent moves up and down as we reach crazy all time highs, like 5500 or something crazy."
"1168230","1172330"," And yet we're doing violent moves the entire way up and then we actually crash the market. "
"1173850","1175850"," The greed knows no bounds."
"1176750","1181190"," You have to understand that as a bear that the greed of these people, they'll break the system"
"1181190","1186010"," every time because they know, they know that eventually the Fed will step in."
"1196060","1202580"," And the put side, I do want you to realize that right now this morning yesterday, there was a lot"
"1202580","1210960"," more weight on spy puts at 464 and those have now been sold. "
"1211760","1219560"," There's like 11,000 puts left, 11,000 contracts left on 464P, but not it looks like they sold them"
"1219560","1220500"," right on the bell this morning."
"1221080","1222020"," They took their money and ran."
"1229140","1231760"," Let's see where support is down below this morning. "
"1232260","1236740"," We want to see where we should expect the market to fall if any negative news comes out."
"1253740","1260720"," See if we can find anything down below some kind of support."
"1263760","1266560"," I'm not seeing that what I am seeing right now at this moment. "
"1267140","1270760"," It looks like the buyers have stepped right up this morning."
"1272420","1275780"," I'm not seeing a bunch of hidden buyers down below it for 60."
"1279720","1281280"," So I don't see them here, right?"
"1281280","1283500"," I don't see them down below at 450. "
"1286780","1290500"," That 455 by line is a little bit of hidden."
"1290780","1297970"," There's a little bit of hidden buyers down below at 450."
"1298710","1301490"," But it looks like the buyers have stepped right up this morning. "
"1308810","1311770"," And you know you've got a seller's hiding above here."
"1312530","1318370"," Sellers are hiding above at 466.43. Be aware of that this morning."
"1329160","1340040"," The cashback close or the cashback or the previous days close would be at 461.71. You"
"1340040","1342040"," do have some support kicking in now. "
"1342140","1346140"," You're watching some buyers step in at 45938."
"1348680","1353720"," And that's the second level down."
"1353880","1361380"," That's the one that was where we were at at 130 in the afternoon yesterday. "
"1362380","1371680"," Was that 459.29. So leave this one up right here for you as we start the day."
"1381860","1384040"," And I'm going to add that on my chart as well."
"1391860","1393580"," You can see it firming up here. "
"1393740","1397560"," It's at 459.32. Sometimes these will move up."
"1397680","1399400"," You'll see this red line disappear."
"1400140","1401960"," You'll see it swing up higher if it does. "
"1405540","1411100"," So we trade sideways, we trade sideways slightly down possibly head into the 10am hour."
"1411660","1414520"," And they're going to wait for what they talk about, right?"
"1415120","1417820"," Prepared statements versus what the question and answers are going to be."
"1436140","1437880"," I read this this morning. "
"1438040","1439360"," Someone was commenting about this."
"1439700","1444860"," I made a comment about this that you fight inflation with taxation, right?"
"1445480","1446280"," We all know that."
"1446580","1449600"," And we all know that they've learned their lesson. "
"1449860","1451620"," You know that Jimmy Carter tried doing that."
"1452600","1453920"," And they made this."
"1454200","1460520"," There used to be this saying back in the day that voting the voting booth is all about taxation. "
"1462760","1465080"," That presidents lose elections over taxation."
"1465600","1469040"," We can argue till we get to the voting booth."
"1469880","1473380"," About all kinds of issues that we don't agree upon. "
"1474920","1477400"," But in reality, once we hit that voting booth."
"1478340","1481720"," The real voters, the people that actually vote typically have something on the line."
"1482020","1482880"," They typically own a home. "
"1484740","1485880"," That's the truth."
"1486200","1486820"," You got to remember that."
"1487160","1488700"," It doesn't matter what party they come from. "
"1489280","1492660"," They want services like I want services."
"1493260","1496440"," I want health care for everybody, but I don't want to pay taxes for it, right?"
"1496880","1498860"," I'm going to be honest with you quietly in the background."
"1499520","1502980"," When I'm not talking to my wife, my friends and all these people out there. "
"1503420","1505960"," You know, I want to pay the same taxes and give free health care."
"1506100","1507180"," That's everybody wants that, right?"
"1508260","1512140"," So when people get in that voting booth and hit that lever, that's all they're thinking about."
"1512620","1513740"," Are we getting more new taxes?"
"1514460","1515260"," Are we getting less taxes?"
"1515580","1516340"," Are we getting no taxes?"
"1516800","1518700"," They do consider that when they vote. "
"1519280","1523200"," And they used to be this line that was said that was, you know, it was a taxes dummy."
"1523380","1524100"," It's always a taxes."
"1525160","1528000"," And so no one wants to step on that landmine, right?"
"1529060","1532020"," So how else do you impact inflation?"
"1532880","1535660"," You can only impact it by tightening credit, right?"
"1535880","1536740"," The Fed can do that. "
"1537320","1538320"," So you're looking for that."
"1538580","1540060"," Is the Fed going to tighten credit?"
"1540660","1542120"," You don't want to hear those words."
"1546760","1548040"," So that's what you're looking for. "
"1548260","1549080"," You're either looking for the Fed."
"1549240","1551400"," You're looking for the Fed president for J."
"1551580","1552720"," Potter say that he's going to tighten credit."
"1552900","1557300"," If he doesn't say that, I don't know how else you fight inflation unless you raise taxes. "
"1558500","1562320"," And are we going to expect that this morning?"
"1569840","1571080"," Chase is awesome."
"1571360","1571900"," Good morning, Chase."
"1572360","1574240"," My friend works in Congress for a top Republican. "
"1574720","1578660"," You probably get him to ask a particular question asked to Powell, LLL."
"1578960","1581100"," Any good questions that will take the market?"
"1581100","1582160"," Yeah, credit tightening."
"1582520","1583100"," That's the one. "
"1584380","1586080"," Yeah, yesterday was a Vanirale."
"1587080","1589700"," There was there was a Vanirale yesterday."
"1590260","1595380"," It should be over today, but it can ramp back up at some point today as well. "
"1597500","1601580"," We had puts roll off again today or taken out of the market."
"1601580","1605440"," These were bought back by I'm assuming by the dealers this morning at the bell."
"1612540","1615480"," Yeah, time for those unrealized gain tax, the tax gains. "
"1617540","1618960"," Are those freaking spoofers?"
"1619320","1620120"," Yeah, they're above again."
"1620260","1621400"," The spoofers are here again today."
"1622160","1623220"," I don't know if they're spoofers. "
"1623360","1626000"," I think that they're I think if I had the guests."
"1628320","1631080"," Yeah, those are cumulative buyers from the cash open."
"1636680","1637520"," Good morning, everybody. "
"1637720","1638260"," Good morning, Chas."
"1639780","1640540"," Morning, Henry."
"1644120","1644520"," Eddie's. "
"1644900","1645480"," Johnny five."
"1645880","1646260"," Where we roam?"
"1646460","1647400"," Good morning, all of you, Thomas."
"1647740","1648240"," Stop running city. "
"1648360","1648900"," Good morning, Charles."
"1649020","1649300"," Good morning."
"1649420","1649800"," Good morning. "
"1650140","1651520"," Such a good morning."
"1651920","1653200"," Hope you're all doing well this morning."
"1660940","1663340"," So I've got these levels tagged this morning. "
"1663580","1663820"," I've got."
"1665080","1667020"," We know about this bounce right here, right?"
"1667160","1668320"," We talked about this bounce here."
"1668680","1669720"," 462-10. "
"1670180","1672700"," You can see a bounce of buyers stepping in here."
"1673120","1674520"," There is a reaction happening."
"1677480","1682700"," We see that these buyers stepped up from 460 or 460-17. "
"1684600","1686780"," You see they've disappeared down below."
"1688080","1692800"," And they've moved higher right to this 462.60 level."
"1694400","1697540"," You know, you've got sellers above at 460-53. "
"1700300","1702920"," I'm probably going to buy some calls right now."
"1702920","1706500"," And then I'm going to buy some puts as if we had higher."
"1706940","1709860"," I'm going to look to see if we maintain support here. "
"1710280","1717180"," If this line here, behind this vertical solid line, if I see this start to disappear, I might wait"
"1717180","1720000"," for this 459 number."
"1721600","1724560"," I don't like that the hero indicator is negative right now."
"1725960","1728140"," I'd really like to grab some calls down here. "
"1728140","1731680"," And then I'd really like to grab some puts above here at 46650."
"1736040","1737460"," Yeah, puts should do well."
"1737920","1739740"," Your puts should do well this morning. "
"1740300","1742400"," You should see people loading up on puts."
"1761300","1764840"," And in all honesty, I usually play these the opposite side."
"1766440","1771120"," I think the first three times we did, everyone was in puts. "
"1771780","1776560"," And so we took the call side the last time with the FOMC minutes."
"1777380","1780700"," Everyone was on the call side because everybody knew we were going up."
"1780980","1782180"," And we took the put side. "
"1783040","1785040"," And of course we crashed, right?"
"1785160","1786360"," We sold off crazy."
"1787580","1789900"," And so we want to see this morning which side everybody's on."
"1791180","1793420"," And we do usually do with splits too. "
"1793580","1798360"," So I probably won't be holding a one sided trade today."
"1798500","1799600"," It'll be a split trade."
"1799600","1809050"," And more than likely we're going to just see you all know. "
"1809590","1812330"," Depending upon how today goes, we are going to rip higher."
"1813890","1815570"," Or we are going to rip lower."
"1816690","1819190"," Surely I doubt that we stay sideways today. "
"1822930","1824750"," INTC has a bid this morning."
"1825310","1826890"," Check out the chart for INTC."
"1828710","1830950"," The flow is light this morning. "
"1831230","1833050"," There's a lot of Apple puts this morning."
"1834710","1838130"," That's not shocking to see Apple taking on some puts this morning."
"1838550","1839710"," The Q's have some puts. "
"1840050","1840870"," Spy has some puts."
"1841130","1841730"," All light though."
"1842170","1845010"," We're talking low six figures on the Q's. "
"1845590","1846690"," Low six figures on Spy."
"1847790","1850450"," Low six figures puts on LCID."
"1850850","1853550"," Lucid Palantares got some light puts on it. "
"1854150","1857130"," Rivian Peton Ford and SFT."
"1858430","1861770"," There are some light calls coming in for the rest of the market this morning."
"1862630","1864690"," Top of the charts is INTC. "
"1865590","1865830"," Then NVIDIA."
"1867190","1867990"," Snap."
"1868690","1868910"," Baba. "
"1869170","1869590"," Amazon."

"1880950","1881590"," DAL. "
"1881590","1882830"," I believe that's Delta Airlines."
"1883330","1883710"," Diska."
"1884510","1884850"," Sea. "
"1886790","1887910"," And GGPI."
"1888250","1888630"," All have calls."
"1889030","1889450"," Not a lot though. "
"1889450","1893270"," Light volume this morning on the options market."
"1896860","1901360"," So maybe I grabbed some call side down here and look for some put side above."
"1901820","1909840"," You can see that we have more sellers lining up here at this 466.44. Be conscious of this red"
"1909840","1910160"," bar. "
"1910480","1915260"," If you see this red bar disappear over here, you want to be looking for it moving lower or"
"1915260","1916320"," disappearing completely."
"1922210","1924070"," Let's talk about a put back ratio real quick."
"1924950","1928750"," Let's see if I can get a chart going here. "
"1931130","1934210"," Do you guys want me to talk about a put back ratio or not a ratio?"
"1934690","1937030"," Well, I guess it's kind of a ratio spread."
"1938850","1944050"," What I was looking at, let me see if I can see if I can put a chart up for"
"1944050","1944350"," you guys."
"1949420","1952080"," You know what I'll do is I'll post the chart to. "
"1956960","1962780"," So this I'm not ultra bearish on the market, but I am open to the trade."
"1965680","1968360"," I am open to the tails trade."
"1968600","1972040"," If anybody doesn't know what the tails trade is. "
"1972800","1977280"," It's a I'll post I have some some some white."
"1977420","1980020"," I have some white and some I have some black papers as well."
"1980660","1983820"," I don't know if I can really I can't release those publicly, but the white papers I can. "
"1984540","1987920"," And it's been a big topic of discussion in the market of reasons."
"1988940","1991020"," Mark Cuban was an originator of this."
"1992900","1996740"," He requests Mark Cuban way back in the day requested to protect his money. "
"1997940","2002620"," As we moved closer to 2007, he said, well, the VIX products were coming out."
"2002740","2006700"," We had we had VIX products coming out that people wanted to trade."
"2006700","2015280"," And then we had reverse VIX products that were being traded for those events, right?"
"2015480","2021180"," When do some of these VIX some of these reverse VIX products wound up getting liquidated?"
"2022080","2026880"," Because we have these we have these tail risk events where the market sells down much lower than"
"2026880","2027460"," anyone expected. "
"2028880","2030220"," That's the long story short."
"2030340","2031720"," I can do a longer version of this."
"2034540","2041480"," But we have these events in the market where the markets looking for an excuse to sell. "
"2042040","2046220"," And they're typically not always, but they're sometimes triggered by major events in the world."
"2047480","2051139"," Like the like 2001, the 9 11 events."
"2052540","2060360"," Maybe a death out there or a COVID are just triggers that actually force us to sell down to a"
"2060360","2061460"," number that we are. "
"2061460","2064520"," They are not expecting an excuse for the market to liquidate."
"2065120","2069199"," And there's a positive that these events are happening sooner than later."
"2073040","2076659"," And the expectation is that they're going to happen more frequently. "
"2077639","2078820"," And there's stuff there."
"2078900","2080739"," There are things that people can't predict, right?"
"2081300","2082500"," These are events that people can't predict."
"2082699","2083420"," They're not on our radar. "
"2084199","2085080"," It's completely unexpected."
"2085820","2087540"," And maybe the market's trading sideways."
"2087540","2090280"," Let's say our market now trades sideways for two years. "
"2090800","2096760"," And it's just looking for an event that sells us down to some stupid number that no one's thought"
"2096760","2097020"," about."
"2097140","2102320"," This isn't really a bearish take on the market, but it is a how do I cover all my bases"
"2102320","2106100"," for free trading plan?"
"2107380","2108460"," And so how do you do that?"
"2108780","2113660"," And the put back spread is when you sell."
"2114180","2115000"," Let me see if I get this right. "
"2115000","2122840"," You sell too close to the in the money puts and you buy an outside of the money put."
"2124120","2127220"," And so what you're doing is you want to buy these at like 480."
"2128700","2132420"," The trade is free or pays you a little bit of money. "
"2133040","2141040"," So if the market continues to go up, the two puts that you sold wind up printing you on the"
"2141040","2141580"," way up, right?"
"2141580","2144420"," And then that way outside of the money put that you buy."
"2145100","2146380"," It's got to be something crazy."
"2146980","2152980"," And I've got some levels like you could buy them for three months out at 404, 406 and then add"
"2152980","2154160"," them every three months. "
"2156060","2162960"," You could and then then then you'd buy like a six month or a year out at 331 for where"
"2162960","2163520"," we are right now."
"2165120","2166140"," Maybe 340."
"2167560","2171860"," You'd buy one then for a year out at believe it or not, 248. "
"2172760","2177580"," And you'd buy one for two years out at 160, 150."
"2178720","2185000"," You go back into the options chains, though, and you look for where the interest is in these puts."
"2185800","2188120"," And I've seen some puts out there. "
"2188740","2191360"," There's some interest at the 150 mark a year out."
"2191940","2193620"," They should be further out of my view."
"2193740","2195140"," They should be like two years out of 150. "
"2196380","2202380"," But if you remember in 2007 and eight, well, actually 2008 itself, we had a steep decline."
"2203060","2206940"," We had a sell off that was, you know, not seen in many, many years."
"2207840","2212200"," And we had that similar thing happen right in 2020. "
"2213320","2215520"," But it wasn't as deep as the 2008."
"2215740","2218560"," So you'd have to structure it where you're at different levels."
"2218560","2225720"," And the key behind this trade is that you have money that's not in play in the market, but it"
"2225720","2227000"," doesn't lose you any money. "
"2227480","2233120"," So, and you'd have to figure out, let's say you play, let's say you make this trade with, let's say"
"2233120","2234460"," you normally trade with $100,000."
"2235660","2240680"," You'd have to structure this trade so that let's say you trade $10,000 on this trade."
"2241160","2245520"," You figure out what it would print at each level in case the market. "
"2245520","2248600"," We had market collapse or a serious market pullback."
"2249440","2256360"," You'd know that you can't trade with that $10,000 for a period of time one year to three years."
"2257460","2263280"," I would never lose any money, but you would know what the payoff would be if these hit so that"
"2263280","2268360"," you could trade with that, with that, with what that money would, what that trade would make in"
"2268360","2268740"," safety. "
"2269260","2271160"," And you leave the rest of your money in cash."
"2272020","2277720"," So, you'd have cash on the side making maybe 4%, 5%, 7%, in safety."
"2278620","2282480"," You take like 10 grand, you make this trade, and then you take the difference. "
"2282760","2286560"," Let's say that's 50 or $90,000, whatever it is, maybe it's 50 grand, right?"
"2286940","2293320"," So, you leave in like 40 to the side, you're trading with 50, you've got 10,000 on this tail"
"2293320","2294340"," risk of trade."
"2295480","2300560"," You take the 50 that you got, and you start trading again and from a bullish perspective, that"
"2300560","2305400"," would, and so that would account for both sides of the trade, that the market sells off deeply."
"2306400","2312220"," It accounts for that crazy.com bubble where we traded straight vertical. "
"2313420","2318440"," And you can take that 50 grand and you'd build that into some massive stockpile."
"2319180","2326680"," You know, you've got 40 grand over here to unleash in case the market does crash, plus the money"
"2326680","2330940"," that you remade from the losses that you incur and the way up."
"2331640","2334160"," Does this make sense to everybody out there, how to trade that?"
"2341140","2344260"," So, yeah, if you guys figure that trade out, right?"
"2344540","2351460"," You'd have to run, you'd have to back trade this trade with whatever your money is. "
"2351600","2355440"," If you got 10 grand, you can trade this with 10 grand, 5 grand, 1,000 bucks."
"2355440","2360940"," You can trade this with a million dollars, whatever your pile of cash is."
"2361660","2365900"," You can work the numbers on this trade to protect you in the downside. "
"2366740","2374620"," I'll post this chart, and I'll show you why I expect those numbers in this tail risk trade."
"2375060","2378960"," I'll show you two examples where it happened in the past, or maybe three."
"2379120","2383020"," I think I have two or three examples of this actually taking place in the past. "
"2383940","2385160"," We've had these events prior."
"2385620","2388000"," It's not like this has not happened in the past."
"2388360","2390260"," And this is in modern times we've had this happen. "
"2391060","2392560"," So, it just protects you along the way."
"2393160","2394680"," And I know a lot of you guys want to be bullish."
"2395300","2397100"," I know that a lot of you guys want to be bullish with protection. "
"2398280","2401120"," Myself included, I'm going to put this trade on."
"2401180","2404440"," I'm hoping I can put this trade on around 470, 480."
"2405400","2411540"," If we can trade up to 475, 470, 480 somewhere in there, if we can get up there, I'm going"
"2411540","2412460"," to place this trade myself. "
"2413360","2415340"," And then I'm going to take a bullish stance in this market."
"2416020","2417200"," Even if we have..."
"2417200","2420020"," So, think about this entire trade."
"2421580","2425600"," And then think about what your expectations are for this year and next year. "
"2425900","2429580"," If we have a normal market for the next..."
"2429580","2432380"," Not a normal market, but a reasonable market for the next two years."
"2432900","2433380"," And that's my viewpoint."
"2434000","2438240"," My viewpoint right now on the market is we're going to have a defined bottom. "
"2439300","2442840"," So, between now and March, we will see a market bottom."
"2443640","2444360"," And we'll have a turn."
"2445060","2447860"," Now, we might trade sideways for the year in that instance. "
"2448700","2452560"," We might trade where we have slight profit, three to six percent, let's say."
"2453520","2456720"," And maybe we trade sideways next year with three to six percent."
"2456860","2457560"," So, we end up trading sideways. "
"2458380","2463140"," Our rate of increase in the market instead of being steep is just flat to slightly up."
"2464020","2467960"," We see that happening right now in the spy from May until now."
"2468100","2471680"," We see a slight rollover in the market. "
"2472060","2475920"," So, I'm going to trade and plan for that happening this year next year."
"2476760","2477200"," Okay."
"2477440","2481340"," So, with that in mind, if we go up straight up, I'm going to still win, right?"
"2481940","2483720"," If I'm looking for this..."
"2483720","2487880"," If I'm trading this and we trade sideways, I'm going to win. "
"2488380","2490980"," If we trade slightly up for the year, I'm going to win."
"2490980","2492560"," If we trade to the top, I'm going to win."
"2493220","2497780"," Now, the only thing that I don't have covered in this trade is if we have that tail risk event. "
"2498260","2501140"," So, that's why I put that putback trade on."
"2502240","2504560"," Now, some of you out there will prefer to trade volatility."
"2505240","2506720"," I can understand trading volatility. "
"2507860","2509760"," For me, though, I want my money back."
"2510260","2513360"," I don't want to take out put spreads because I'll never make that money back."
"2513760","2517420"," I don't want to take out far outside the money puts because I will never make my money back. "
"2517860","2521840"," I don't want to take out volatility trades because if that event doesn't happen, I'll never make my"
"2521840","2522520"," money back again."
"2522780","2525840"," So, those three choices for me don't pay me."
"2526280","2529500"," I want to be paid and I want to protect my protection. "
"2532720","2534660"," Yeah, I'm going to put Powell on here in just a moment live."
"2535380","2536640"," You guys want me to put some Powell on?"
"2539960","2541480"," I'll put Powell on live right now."
"2545400","2546640"," It's not going to be the best audio. "
"2547220","2553300"," I can put it out in the background of this broadcast, but it'll be..."
"2553300","2560700"," It'll wind up using too much juice for me to put out a 1080p, 60 frames per second broadcast."
"2576920","2583250"," Does everybody understand this entire thing, this concept?"
"2583910","2586810"," And if you don't know how to do these trades, if you're listening to me right now, let's say you"
"2586810","2592810"," only trade on Robinhood or you only trade on, I don't know, Webull or something where you can't"
"2592810","2594030"," trade these complex trades."
"2594990","2597130"," We can put place this trade live at some point. "
"2597130","2601890"," If you guys sign up for, let's say, tasty trade, even if you don't use it as your main trading"
"2601890","2610710"," account, you could use a tasty trade as just your side account or something similar, some account"
"2610710","2612290"," where you can do a complex trade on."
"2612750","2614050"," You open up one of these accounts."
"2615130","2619670"," You just put the amount of money that you want to hedge the market with into it, even if it's"
"2619670","2620130"," a hundred bucks. "
"2621130","2624550"," You put the money, I don't know if you can do with a hundred bucks, but put a grand in"
"2624550","2624750"," there."
"2626070","2630630"," Put 500 bucks in there, and you just put this one trade on in this account."
"2630850","2635210"," Even if you're a simple trader, and I typically trade very simply, but if you want to put some"
"2635210","2640790"," complex trade on, you can watch YouTube videos to do it on your own, how to place this trade. "
"2641310","2646570"," I'm sure the tasty trade has a video out there on how to actually execute this trade, and you just"
"2646570","2648350"," follow step-by-step on how to execute it."
"2648730","2654190"," If they don't have a video on YouTube, you can actually contact tasty trade and just say to them,"
"2654190","2656070"," hey, I want to put this hedge on the market."
"2656390","2657670"," Can you walk me through the steps?"
"2692980","2694420"," Hang tight for just a second here. "
"2694460","2699140"," I'm trying to figure out where the Fed's channel is."
"2700240","2702620"," I want the most up to the minute."
"2726170","2726810"," I'm surprised. "
"2727190","2728290"," There's no live conference."
"2728750","2732790"," The Fed Reserve doesn't have their live feed today."
"2740940","2742880"," So it looks like we're going to have to go with one of the major. "
"2789090","2791250"," It looks like Fauci's out at the moment."
"2795570","2798470"," All right, so I've got one of these broadcasts up right now."
"2802050","2803130"," Quinn, I saw that. "
"2803210","2804810"," I can't even repeat that live over the air."
"2806270","2807690"," CSP, CSPAN is the best place."
"2808250","2809110"," All right, thanks, Chase. "
"2809990","2811250"," Let me see if I can go to CSPAN."
"2819480","2821400"," Let's see what we got right now, CSPAN."
"2821580","2823080"," Yeah, I'm going to go back to what I had on. "
"2823240","2831790"," I think I've got the United States Senate Committee hearing channels."
"2831790","2868550"," All right, so"
"2868550","2869890"," I've got it on live right now."
"2871950","2874750"," Did you get this nice, beautiful bounce below here at 4.62?"
"2882610","2883830"," Quinn leaked it here. "
"2884510","2885430"," Has Quinn spit yet?"
"2888430","2890210"," The CNBC YouTube channel."
"2891890","2893610"," Yeah, what's going on at the book map levels?"
"2893630","2901270"," We did have buyers step in at 4.62. We should trade close to this 4.66. You don't want"
"2901270","2902290"," to be Icarus, right?"
"2914620","2919320"," I'll post a YouTube channel to Twitter."
"2919980","2927140"," And if you guys have a better channel on Twitter, can you post it in the comment section so that"
"2928580","2930240"," you guys have a direct feed, maybe?"
"2931360","2934880"," This is from, I believe this feed is from..."
"2936600","2942440"," Feed the demand is, I believe, CNBC television, but I prefer the direct feed if anybody has it. "
"2943800","2947540"," I just posted it, the CNBC feed, to Twitter."
"2958120","2964160"," I'm going to post, just so you guys can see, I'm going to post some photos on Twitter of that"
"2964160","2968020"," trade and how you would expect it to happen."
"2968600","2972320"," I've got to post the levels I have posted are 1, 2, 3, and 4."
"2972920","2978680"," The number 4 level would be similar to the previous instances of this taking place. "
"2979700","2987620"," I apologize for how terrible this looks, but the trade would extend into somewhere in 2024."
"2991920","2993640"," Looks like it's starting right now."
"3012460","3014420"," Let's see if I can..."
"3032310","3033490"," I'm going to just second here. "
"3033570","3034630"," I'm going to post these for you guys."
"3064040","3065740"," I'm having a hard time getting this on."
"3067760","3069820"," Maybe Joe Donut can post..."
"3069820","3073660"," I don't know if Joe Donut's listening in this morning, but I did send them to Joe Donut yesterday. "
"3080770","3093300"," You are seeing some resistance above on 1, 2,"
"3093800","3094340"," 3, 4."
"3094340","3099100"," If you look back at the past 4 trading days, we do have that resistance above."
"3100320","3101980"," Here we are tapping right now."
"3106080","3107500"," I'm going to show you that channel. "
"3173740","3175220"," Looks like someone's got a great."
"3175720","3176000"," There we"
"3177310","3199610"," go,"
"3200990","3200990"," Federal Reserve."
"3215470","3219550"," Looks like Chan Su posted a great link. "
"3221900","3227280"," Looks like M put a great link, juice put a great link."
"3227280","3233560"," I think for the most live version of..."
"3247840","3250460"," Take a shot every time someone says transitory."
"3250840","3251460"," I should go get some whiskey. "
"3254730","3261890"," Joe, I was looking for you to post the three charts or four charts I sent you yesterday to put"
"3261890","3263950"," that put back trade on."
"3269770","3273490"," I guess comrade Chairman Brown is a Democrat."
"3278570","3280690"," It's weird because Jay Powell is a conservative. "
"3285730","3287990"," Small cap speculative stocks are pumping today."
"3293690","3295810"," Look at Finviz and see what's up."
"3328690","3335490"," Looks like consumer defensive is up, consumer cyclical is up, health care is financials, energies,"
"3337070","3338570"," all the usual suspects this morning. "
"3340840","3343740"," Some basic materials, some biotech is up this morning."
"3348140","3350940"," A little bit of technology, not a ton."
"3351260","3353100"," Compass is up this morning for tech. "
"3356020","3357560"," AVPT is up this morning."
"3359240","3359780"," That's another tech."
"3359780","3364640"," A mostly health care financial. "
"3365060","3366640"," How's Excel video in this morning?"
"3367300","3370580"," I was a trade from yesterday."
"3370580","3371060"," Mm."
"3384250","3386610"," Sold off at the bell or at the open this morning. "
"3420170","3421550"," You guys hear this broadcast?"
"3421930","3423550"," Hear the speaker from the Senate?"
"3433240","3435560"," RK is on a rally right now."
"3445780","3448100"," I'm interested to see if XLV holds this."
"3448840","3455540"," So XLV traded high into the close yesterday at 350 in the afternoon and it just retouched. "
"3457440","3460280"," Yesterday's cashback close right or the gap close."
"3499310","3501330"," Some Tesla puts coming in currently."
"3501790","3502930"," We'll bring up Tesla for you guys. "
"3502950","3504830"," I know a lot of you guys are Tesla fans."
"3519510","3524190"," Seeing a lot of, as people have already noted, tickers coming in."
"3524490","3525210"," We have QS. "
"3526070","3527010"," These are all calls."
"3527010","3537790"," Calls on QS, X, S, Q, till Ray, Snap, Lyft, Diska, Docu, AAL,"
"3538670","3540830"," Baba, Oxy, Nvidia."
"3541390","3542230"," We already talked about that one. "
"3542450","3548990"," OVV, Peton, DKNG, Hood, all retail favorite stocks."
"3548990","3550310"," MTG, Run."
"3558270","3559210"," How's AFR?"
"3559290","3559990"," I'm doing this morning. "
"3562370","3562930"," Wow."
"3564650","3565210"," AFRM."
"3566090","3568410"," I think we've called that yesterday, right?"
"3569030","3571530"," $82 was the sailing for AFR. "
"3571630","3578970"," We'll take a look at AFR."
"3589690","3593150"," Looks like currently there is some small support here."
"3593390","3594690"," 158 on Tesla. "
"3626360","3629840"," You got Mr. Tumi out here telling you to rein it in."
"3629840","3633920"," And then the moment that our Republican becomes president, they're not rating anything in."
"3635180","3636600"," You got to love this. "
"3677250","3687470"," I'll take a look"
"3687470","3688930"," at XLV again this morning."
"3690150","3696410"," They are on the top of the charts along with financials and energy and some of the retail favorite"
"3696410","3696830"," stocks."
"3697610","3704910"," It could be another good day for XLV. "
"3720640","3722900"," More buyers than sellers on XLV."
"3723100","3727160"," XLV is one of these stocks where you buy a bottom."
"3727400","3727900"," You trade it up. "
"3728080","3731240"," A lot of boiler rooms trade AFRM, sorry, not XLV."
"3731820","3735040"," A lot of boiler rooms will trade AFRM."
"3735280","3740560"," One of the great things about trading this stock as well recently the past few months as you'll"
"3740560","3743220"," find a nice bottom down here and it'll trade back up again. "
"3744180","3746200"," It is trading along VWAP."
"3746340","3747180"," It looks like this morning."
"3750760","3752320"," Let's see where the buyers are at. "
"3752640","3753440"," You've got the sell."
"3753940","3755420"," You had a sell above at $82."
"3755920","3757080"," We knew about this one yesterday. "
"3758280","3763880"," Your real price target is $89.46. It does follow somewhat."
"3765500","3768360"," It follows like a day trader's rules."
"3768980","3770940"," It'll respect VWAP to an extent. "
"3771640","3773260"," It's tapping on VWAP right now."
"3773760","3781140"," The real money is down below at $76.11. If it does break below VWAP slightly, there's some more"
"3781140","3785380"," buyers stepping in at $78.69. It's a really good trade."
"3785600","3788600"," There's a lot of day traders that trade this stock when it's running. "
"3789400","3793860"," You will see steep sell-offs and you'll see nice steep rips on it as well."
"3802250","3804330"," How many of you have a ticker you want me to look at?"
"3804670","3806090"," I'll post it in the comments."
"3813440","3815020"," The silver fox is speaking. "
"3816680","3819540"," Let me know in the comments if you have any tickers that you want to see."
"3826300","3827940"," You guys are hilarious out there."
"3828780","3831140"," I love all the names you have for everybody. "
"3848140","3850160"," Let's see if I have any more support down here."
"3850160","3856920"," If I'm going to guess, let's see, 4.62. Let's take a look at that ice down there."
"3863490","3865950"," I'd really like to see us trade down here. "
"3866130","3870770"," It's like a moment of weakness and then a trade up and see this red bar kind of disappear."
"3873570","3875310"," I'm going to put a trade on here in a moment."
"3878090","3880130"," I'll check Tesla again. "
"3882690","3885310"," BCRX, LFG, Palantara is making a move."
"3885590","3889050"," PayPal, EPST. I'll run through these one at a time. "
"3893790","3894710"," 469, 466."
"3896790","3897950"," Let's see where we're at."
"3898350","3899950"," I'm going to try to throw a trade on here. "
"3904960","3906560"," Let's XLF doing this morning."
"3906800","3907380"," Is it still ripping?"
"3910540","3913040"," Yeah, I might take this XLF trade."
"3926610","3929710"," Let's see if there's any sneaky Pete's hiding around in here. "
"3931290","3941230"," There are 2,000 contracts on XLF expiring on Friday for 8"
"3941230","3941550"," cents."
"3942550","3946070"," There's 7 cents and 8 cents apiece, 42 C."
"3946070","3949930"," I don't know if I would take that trade."
"3950750","3955070"," I'd probably just take it in the money, 41 C at 35 cents. "
"3955250","3956870"," It should pay 100%."
"3956870","3959570"," Let's look at the 21st."
"3960230","3963410"," There are some puts on the 21st, which makes sense. "
"3963690","3964090"," We trade up."
"3964230","3967350"," We trade down into Thursday of the 20th."
"3967530","3967670"," Whatever. "
"3968050","3968710"," What's that Thursday?"
"3969790","3975870"," It wouldn't be shocking to see us trade up and then trade down into the 20th."
"3976810","3981770"," Then the 20th, we trade up and then we go sideways into the 21st."
"3982550","3984370"," That's what we've been doing in past years. "
"3985330","3992930"," On the January 14th, we've got a whole bunch of interest on 42 C on XLF."
"3993590","3996650"," There are a ton of XLF calls coming in this morning."
"3997990","4000930"," It looks like XLF is just finished. "
"4000930","4004570"," It's a gap close."
"4005350","4006890"," I want to look on the one month chart."
"4008050","4009330"," That's an interesting trade. "
"4010810","4020770"," The only concern I have on this trade is that we touched $41 at the opening bell on the"
"4020770","4021350"," 10th."
"4021890","4023350"," We've already seen $41."
"4024250","4026210"," Do we see 41 again?"
"4026890","4027710"," That's a tough call. "
"4029910","4035930"," There are a lot of puts on the following date on the 21st."
"4036550","4044650"," There's a lot of put concentration on 40.5 and those are 43 cents each."
"4045870","4049570"," If you did a straddle with two dates, it's not going to pay enough. "
"4049870","4057690"," I don't think the safer play overall is probably the puts expiring on January 20th."
"4059430","4060690"," That's the safest trade."
"4063470","4065730"," There are a lot of calls coming in for that. "
"4065830","4072110"," There are still some interest on 42 C, but I still don't like that."
"4072670","4077730"," Because it's such an illiquid spider that they don't always print."
"4078270","4079890"," The market makers won't print them. "
"4080730","4082610"," I'll tend to take the in the money trade."
"4083390","4086590"," Maybe you take 41 C expiring on the 14th."
"4087830","4090990"," Put an order in for like 32 cents or 35 cents. "
"4091250","4095109"," See if it fills and you might get 100% trade out of that one."
"4099260","4101880"," I don't know if I like XLF as much as I was thinking I did."
"4117260","4122000"," Let me go up here and I'll pump out some of these things for you. "
"4123220","4124140"," Who do you want me to do?"
"4125240","4126399"," Where am I starting here?"
"4126399","4129180"," You guys put out some crazy, okay."
"4129819","4131540"," Let's start with NVDA."
"4132859","4134140"," We'll make our way through. "
"4139279","4150930"," I want"
"4150930","4152590"," to check the spy call put."
"4156109","4157950"," Where is everybody on Friday?"
"4160910","4161850"," Oh boy."
"4163149","4170500"," Everybody's loaded to the tips and puts for Wednesday. "
"4173670","4176490"," And everybody's on splits for Friday."
"4177130","4178170"," That is the safe trade."
"4178930","4188350"," You've got a lot of people loading up on Friday, January 14 by 460 P and 465 C."
"4189510","4192330"," So that's the spread for Friday. "
"4194570","4196010"," That sounds reasonable."
"4196830","4198230"," It's not a bad trade actually."
"4203180","4205160"," And it looks like the puts have gone away. "
"4205640","4207520"," Some algo turned off the put side."
"4217680","4222860"," And there's a ton of interest on us hitting 470 by Friday."
"4225900","4227800"," There's still a little rich for my blood. "
"4227940","4233820"," A dollar, a contract for 470 on Friday is still pretty expensive."
"4242200","4246620"," Okay, so NVDA, what are we looking at here?"
"4247240","4249300"," We've got a NVDA's trading on VWAP today."
"4250000","4254140"," We've got a lot of pressure above. "
"4257260","4259060"," The real buyers are below 260."
"4260340","4262840"," We have some more support here, 268."
"4264100","4266780"," But you do have sellers feeding into NVDA. "
"4267340","4268580"," We're going to be conscious of this."
"4268580","4271560"," This looks like a bank allowing it to go up."
"4271560","4274280"," Then they sell into you and they drop it back down. "
"4274300","4275380"," Then they sell into you."
"4276120","4278120"," But you do have resistance at 275."
"4278960","4284180"," You have more resistance above at 279 on Nvidia. "
"4284940","4288180"," This does look like a classic dispersion trading."
"4289940","4290840"," Not dispersion."
"4294220","4296340"," Take a look at the chart on Nvidia. "
"4296340","4301520"," Yeah, this looks more like it's still being sold down."
"4302660","4307280"," I can see the idea that it's going to rip higher here though."
"4307640","4309280"," And on the, at least on the candlestick chart. "
"4312300","4314360"," Nvidia looks like it's going to squeeze above."
"4317000","4319740"," You know, if it squeezes above this 280 mark right here."
"4321140","4328380"," But it does, I mean, this does still look like a classic bull trap, to be honest. "
"4334080","4337060"," This would be the price target above 307, 301."
"4338180","4343200"," Two, no, sorry, 299 and 308."
"4345180","4347320"," Real supports down below at 251. "
"4350340","4351500"," Nvidia is a tough one to call."
"4351500","4354540"," I can see the bull case for this."
"4358060","4361880"," I can see a bank trying to do this as well. "
"4362380","4366500"," But the reality is Nvidia still needs to cool off."
"4367940","4370560"," It's still in that cool off phase."
"4370860","4372820"," It ripped higher for a long time. "
"4372920","4376760"," It didn't really, it didn't really, let's look at a year chart on."
"4377900","4378860"," Yeah, I mean, let's look."
"4382280","4383640"," Let's be honest about Nvidia. "
"4384820","4388140"," Trade started way back in March at $60."
"4389300","4391120"," Nvidia went to a high of 364."
"4392760","4401340"," I mean, the argument that I have against the bull here is that a bank is going to take profit"
"4401340","4402040"," at some point. "
"4402800","4409360"," And while they're taking profit, they're going to make a bull or a small fund think that it has new"
"4409360","4409980"," highs coming."
"4409980","4413420"," And so they will take their shorts off."
"4413640","4415400"," They will let it rise higher. "
"4415620","4416400"," You can trade that."
"4416500","4417920"," I'm not saying you can't trade that rip."
"4418960","4420600"," But I still think it trades down. "
"4422100","4423060"," Let's call it at."
"4423820","4426040"," Say if you're a bull and you're like, nope, we're going to trade higher."
"4429000","4430420"," Yeah, you're probably good to that 295. "
"4431580","4433700"," And then I'd expect another selldown at that point."
"4434820","4435880"," Probably good to that 295."
"4437220","4439360"," Now that 300 that you see on the screen right now. "
"4440140","4440960"," It's a tough call."
"4441760","4444480"," It's tough call because all you need is some bad news to come out."
"4446120","4447340"," And it's going to sell. "
"4448520","4450040"," But you know, we all take our own risk."
"4451240","4452480"," So I was in VDA."
"4452760","4454140"," I'll do net next. "
"4456440","4459540"," I think they're easier trades than Nvidia and VDA."
"4460180","4461620"," I don't think you can't trade it."
"4461620","4466320"," I just think that there's, I think that there's trades that are not as risky. "
"4469700","4472620"," So I'm not, I'm not negative on Nvidia, just thinking that."
"4476340","4478380"," I think you can take that trade, that long trade."
"4479340","4481200"," But I also think that there's high risk in it. "
"4483180","4487680"," So look at net next and we'll see if I can find something for myself to trade."
"4502140","4504000"," So you got real support on net at 100."
"4504740","4507000"," You've got heavy resistance above at 117. "
"4509640","4511280"," You've got more buyers than sellers."
"4512320","4514140"," It's trading along VWAP today."
"4517900","4526480"," Your first real resistance is 114.92. Then 115.84. Then the real seller's stepping at 117.57."
"4531440","4532760"," That's a good question on hood. "
"4532760","4533660"," We'll look at hood next."
"4534320","4535980"," Where's the real buy wall at at hood?"
"4536880","4537680"," You know, it's weird."
"4537920","4542480"," I might not get to see the hood bottom if day traders keep stepping in. "
"4542940","4545920"," I realize that that's going to happen too on hood."
"4546300","4548320"," It's too juicy not to buy."
"4548780","4552360"," That's where I might miss the, I might miss the hood trade due to that. "
"4553640","4554840"," And I expect that."
"4557540","4559560"," So it's possible that I miss that."
"4559560","4563440"," The real buyers are still down below at 1360. "
"4563980","4568140"," That doesn't mean though that you can't buy these dips because it's too juicy."
"4568520","4574320"," You know that you got to bounce up here some resistance at 1653 at 1692."
"4574780","4576460"," It's very tradable day trading it. "
"4577600","4579600"," I like hood as a day trade right now."
"4580080","4583800"," I can't say that I don't like the trade on hood."
"4584080","4586620"," You've got heavy resistance above at 17 bucks. "
"4587120","4589900"," So you just keep buying the dips and selling the rips in this stock."
"4590660","4593300"," You can day trade it every day from like 15 bucks, right?"
"4593420","4593900"," We know this."
"4594300","4595320"," This is how it's been trading. "
"4595880","4597360"," We know we have more support at $14."
"4598760","4602920"," But I'm waiting for myself to buy it because I'm not day trading it right now."
"4603160","4606340"," If I was day trading it right now, you buy it as a 15 bucks. "
"4606780","4608640"," Trade it up to 1788."
"4609280","4611000"," Rinse repeat until it doesn't work anymore."
"4613460","4614600"," I do like the hood trade. "
"4620520","4621940"," I did net BX."
"4622720","4623100"," I'll do next."
"4633100","4635800"," Looks like the Nvidia trade is reversing slightly. "
"4642080","4645520"," There's a lot of coiling right now on the spy at that resistance."
"4646480","4648500"," So we'll check back in if it is rejected."
"4648860","4650700"," I'm looking to enter spy. "
"4651220","4654580"," I believe at 461 71 or 462."
"4655660","4656660"," One more time."
"4656680","4657800"," I want to see it come back down. "
"4657800","4661020"," I'm not quite ready to take a trade yet."
"4663780","4665700"," BX has more sellers than buyers."
"4666540","4668560"," The wall on BX is 120. "
"4669900","4673840"," All the real buyers are down at 11028."
"4676240","4677680"," I'll look at Q's next."
"4680180","4683700"," Usually when I do these every day, we'll find one really good trade in here. "
"4684500","4687180"," We look through enough and we look through like 10 or 20 of them."
"4687340","4688900"," We'll find a great setup."
"4693720","4696060"," We talked about this 380 the other day, right?"
"4696720","4699180"," And we talked about 380 being a nice wall of support. "
"4702900","4704380"," See where the real buyers are."
"4704900","4706240"," See if they've gone lower or not."
"4708600","4711360"," And this does work for the bull case, right?"
"4712500","4716540"," Because 380 was a serious support level for the Q's. "
"4717940","4723690"," We look at NDX."
"4726730","4732130"," We had that nice big fat trade down that took place yesterday on NASDAQ."
"4732930","4733990"," And it reclaims support. "
"4734490","4740050"," If we knew that 380 was that contentious area for NASDAQ."
"4741070","4743090"," You guys know about stock manipulation."
"4743770","4750170"," You know about when the price of a stock, it'll trade in a defined area. "
"4750170","4752890"," You've got this upward bound and lower bound."
"4753530","4755330"," And you know that it'll bounce around in there."
"4755770","4758150"," You know that you have buy sell orders at the top and bottom. "
"4758630","4760170"," And then out of nowhere, it'll trade higher."
"4760870","4761870"," Out of nowhere, it'll trade lower."
"4762510","4765230"," We saw that yesterday with NASDAQ. "
"4766050","4770430"," So the bulls are looking for that 380 level to hold."
"4772720","4776560"," And there are some pretty fair sellers above here at 381."
"4776760","4778260"," There is a supply side sell. "
"4778260","4780640"," This doesn't do well for the bull case."
"4781940","4789300"," That is my concern too, is that you see tech stocks that have been beaten down for a year from"
"4789300","4790180"," that 2020 trade."
"4790920","4793400"," And then you see some tech stocks that have held the market up. "
"4794840","4797080"," The entire year of 2021, right?"
"4797400","4798040"," Now we're in 2022."
"4798900","4806020"," And my own expectation is that for at least the next three months, you see the tech that was beaten"
"4806020","4807400"," up come up slightly."
"4808480","4813000"," To meet with maybe a lot of these big tech stocks that have held up the market. "
"4813480","4815020"," They kind of meet in the middle at some point."
"4815280","4816860"," And then the market will make a move higher."
"4818440","4822900"," And I think you even heard Mike Wilson talk about this concept yesterday in CNBC. "
"4823480","4824600"," The same similar concept."
"4825720","4833020"," You'll see these banks take profit off this next ER on these big tech names."
"4833020","4836880"," And then you'll see everything kind of compressed together. "
"4837480","4838980"," And the market will eventually move up."
"4840840","4846940"," And you know that right now the buyers and the sellers are kind of a clash right now on the"
"4846940","4847180"," queues."
"4848380","4854120"," You can see the support level that was here at 378 has moved up a little bit. "
"4854220","4855500"," It's kind of disappeared at this point."
"4856120","4858340"," You have more buyers than sellers."
"4858720","4860280"," So you get a war going on the queues right now. "
"4861720","4865240"," You have a lot of call buyers stepping in right now as well."
"4865680","4869720"," So if I think the trades in the spy going along, I'm assuming that a lot of you think that"
"4869720","4871740"," the trade is in the queues going along."
"4872380","4881960"," I want you to show the next level of support on the queues is 371, 23, 368, 22, and 365,"
"4882820","4882820"," 43. "
"4884100","4886260"," This is where the smart money is down below here."
"4887480","4889220"," So it's a pretty big fall."
"4889940","4890880"," That's a significant fall. "
"4891020","4894880"," If the queues were to fall like that, you would see the spy fall most definitely."
"4900770","4902110"," I'll do Amazon next."
"4902430","4903330"," Same story with Amazon. "
"4903450","4905890"," The queues Amazon holds the queues up."
"4906130","4907510"," I'll put Amazon up real quick."
"4911090","4913730"," And you'd see the spy fall but not quite like the queues. "
"4914030","4914910"," You know the queues can fall."
"4914910","4921830"," The queues will take a bigger hit than the spy will because of financials, cyclicals, because of"
"4921830","4922070"," energy."
"4922730","4927190"," They don't have cyclicals, energy, financials within the queues. "
"4928090","4929970"," The queues are only the 100, right?"
"4930790","4939510"," And then you've got the S&P 500 that has another significant weight in it to spread that risk"
"4939510","4939830"," around."
"4947380","4949620"," You are still seeing a bounce in NDX."
"4950060","4953660"," You know that that trade down on the can can NDX go down. "
"4953980","4954560"," I think it can."
"4954820","4956880"," I think NDX has a problem right now."
"4957340","4960580"," I think NDX has a problem of rotation. "
"4961600","4963600"," I think that's the problem in NDX."
"4963880","4965500"," You got to be honest with you guys."
"4981920","4984600"," Give Amazon just a minute here for it to load up. "
"4989320","4990780"," So you guys are saying down below."
"4992460","4993320"," So you got Amazon."
"4995060","4996460"," What are you guys saying down here?"
"4998200","4999540"," RK is giving it all back. "
"4999920","5001140"," ALL is bouncing."
"5002180","5002940"," Airlines are all green."
"5003200","5004340"," Thanks for saying something in Vasqua. "
"5009140","5011560"," Yeah, I was going to play the..."
"5014610","5016110"," Yeah, Vasqua's got some good points."
"5016810","5020330"," Quinn's saying that the Kansas City Fed President George can't ignore extraordinary large balance"
"5020330","5020590"," sheet."
"5021390","5021930"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"5022470","5023090"," You can't ignore it."
"5025010","5025890"," What about Tesla?"
"5027150","5028070"," Yes, Chop."
"5031630","5033170"," Yeah, XLE is going bananas. "
"5035510","5037670"," Yeah, the trade is..."
"5037670","5038830"," This morning the trade is in healthcare."
"5039790","5042050"," It's in consumer cyclicals."
"5044130","5045330"," It's in energy. "
"5046190","5047350"," That's where the trade is this morning."
"5048230","5049290"," You can't deny it."
"5049450","5050110"," I just looked it up. "
"5050370","5056830"," I have a Finvis tracker every morning that shows me which sectors are being bought this morning,"
"5056990","5057110"," right?"
"5057450","5059030"," Regardless of what the flow says."
"5061150","5063170"," I don't have much to say to you guys."
"5064530","5071810"," See if I can look for some serious support in the queues. "
"5076450","5077310"," 3,200."
"5078150","5079310"," Do you really want to know?"
"5079910","5081490"," Real buyers at 3,200 this morning."
"5084870","5087970"," You've got a Hero Hero indicator on Amazon. "
"5098900","5100360"," What else are you looking at this morning?"
"5101840","5102600"," Did NQ?"
"5103940","5105200"," I'll do MO next."
"5118540","5121000"," We have some rejection right now on the spy."
"5121920","5123780"," You'll probably come back to it here in a moment. "
"5124300","5127540"," I am going to be looking to buy one of these dips in the spy at some point."
"5127540","5133900"," I just don't like the price of what you guys to understand some way."
"5134000","5139620"," You guys to look at your options chain for the options that are expiring on Friday. "
"5139620","5140920"," I always hear this from people too."
"5141000","5144460"," They say, well, options are expensive because they're going someplace."
"5145580","5146020"," I'm always. "
"5146600","5147500"," So, MO."
"5149300","5150480"," Boy, I'll tell you what."
"5150740","5154260"," MO might be a nice short. "
"5154260","5156960"," You got a huge bounce on MO down here at $49."
"5159380","5160880"," Huge bounce on MO."
"5162980","5168540"," You've got more slightly more sellers than buyers, but you saw this nice little bounce here. "
"5169060","5171400"," It might be a good trade, actually."
"5172940","5173820"," But tight range."
"5177060","5180500"," If I have to say anything, I'm going to say that the book map is not going to really lend"
"5180500","5183580"," much insight into where it's headed. "
"5184900","5187200"," Looks like it's crashing here on some support."
"5187360","5188180"," This is nice to see."
"5188820","5190740"," Your price target right now is $51. "
"5192040","5193000"," 10% move."
"5193060","5193560"," That's pretty good."
"5195280","5196900"," We're going to check on the spy real quick. "
"5199400","5201460"," I don't like seeing options that pricey."
"5201800","5206560"," I watch the daily and weekly spy chain every weekend, week out every day."
"5207440","5211780"," And they do trade out of bounds and get very pricey, right?"
"5212440","5218940"," But right before we're going to make a move, never like to see those options cost $2. "
"5220200","5225340"," I always feel like the market maker is going to step in, steal a bunch of money from them, and"
"5225340","5227560"," then they'll swing them to a crazy number."
"5233030","5241590"," I like this down below this 4.62. We have a second tap happening right now onto support onto the"
"5241590","5241810"," spy."
"5242650","5244650"," Might enter a trade here at this point. "
"5245190","5246110"," Getting close to it."
"5248530","5250210"," Let the spy load up real quick."
"5252510","5256050"," I probably need to clear my spy history on book map. "
"5256510","5260910"," Looks like it's running a little bit slower because it's loading from Monday."
"5263470","5265250"," It's going to take a minute for it to load."
"5268570","5274570"," I have to clear my book map history every day. "
"5283700","5285100"," It's almost loaded up here."
"5301140","5303120"," Check out a XL and X."
"5319060","5319580"," Nice."
"5319880","5321360"," We see winky faces. "
"5321820","5324060"," Some of you guys out there follow what I'm saying."
"5324780","5327140"," Some of you guys pay attention to what I'm always telling you guys."
"5327920","5329500"," I want to see it cheaper. "
"5330120","5333020"," I want to see the price of an option cheaper heading into Friday."
"5333380","5334720"," Wednesday usually kills us."
"5334800","5336080"," It's usually a kill option day. "
"5336740","5338200"," They'll kill the price of options."
"5339120","5340780"," The FOMO buyers come in both sides."
"5340960","5341800"," Bull's bears on a Monday. "
"5342360","5343080"," Not Wednesday."
"5343380","5343580"," I'm sorry."
"5344200","5345700"," FOMO buyers come in on Monday, right?"
"5346700","5349700"," You'll see nice prints on Monday. "
"5349700","5350820"," Then I got Tuesday."
"5353000","5356080"," You'll see the price of options get cheaper."
"5360870","5362610"," Let's see if we can get this to come in a little bit. "
"5364110","5364830"," Come on now."
"5365670","5366010"," Okay."
"5371520","5372900"," So maybe we can make a trade here. "
"5377360","5378040"," Same thing."
"5378340","5379400"," Sellers still waiting above."
"5380220","5381340"," Sellers are waiting for something. "
"5381560","5382300"," I don't know what it is."
"5383000","5384280"," It is concerning to see."
"5385260","5389820"," We do have the cumulative indicator slightly on the positive side. "
"5390880","5392700"," Probably a day trader buying the bounce."
"5395740","5399560"," But I don't like when we see those sellers above."
"5400600","5405780"," I don't like that wall above us being that low. "
"5440200","5442280"," Keep your eyes on XLNX."
"5448660","5452440"," It's been trading down since December 28th."
"5453280","5455640"," I hit a bottom yesterday at 184. "
"5457060","5463020"," And some calls just came in January 21."
"5466380","5469120"," 220C for $194,000."
"5469720","5471660"," It is highlighted as a great trade. "
"5471960","5473520"," The algo score is quite high on it."
"5479220","5482420"," XLNX 220C for January 21."
"5483980","5485320"," Keep an eye on that one. "
"5488460","5490540"," AFRM is just going crazy right now."
"5490980","5492920"," Stupid call flow and AFRM."
"5497620","5499860"," Day traders are all over that trade for sure. "
"5500860","5502280"," I got another good one for you."
"5502760","5503040"," Dish."
"5503800","5504000"," Maybe. "
"5504220","5504860"," Let me check it first."
"5510640","5511400"," Maybe not."
"5511700","5512080"," Scratch dish. "
"5513080","5518060"," Dish has been trading up from 30 bucks since December 3."
"5518060","5520520"," It's at $34 right now."
"5520520","5522840"," It's been ripping since the open this morning."
"5523580","5528020"," I do see some calls coming in on it, but I don't like buying it unless it's on a dip. "
"5528360","5533440"," It's February 18th, 35C for a half million dollars."
"5533960","5538620"," If you wanted to take this trade, this 35C on dish."
"5539980","5545720"," What I would say to you is the responsible thing is to buy this trade on a dip. "
"5545720","5547180"," It dips every day."
"5548240","5552720"," If you dipped back down to like $33.91, I might take that trade."
"5553600","5554680"," Wait for it to dip down. "
"5554800","5556100"," Maybe it might not dip down today."
"5556200","5562980"," It might dip down tomorrow, but you can in a journal write that trade down and possibly take it."
"5563340","5569920"," You can take it now, but it's risky because dish does sell down like one, two, three, four, five,"
"5570580","5575540"," six times now it's sold off in the past 20 days. "
"5575540","5577780"," So every four or five days it does trade down."
"5579040","5583700"," Look, make sure you're checking it on a chart with like a month out or so so you can see"
"5583700","5584860"," where actually where it's at."
"5589080","5591920"," LCID is still ripping or more calls coming in LCID. "
"5592500","5595520"," Airline calls all morning long DAL."
"5595680","5605630"," You guys can also trade that on jets at big rotation trades still going on"
"5605630","5606050"," this morning."
"5607390","5610710"," Yeah, XLF is starting to trade down right here. "
"5610830","5618350"," It looks like XLV is trading down a little bit as well."
"5619570","5624210"," It's still sitting on its support from that from that gap close from yesterday."
"5625230","5626350"," It's sitting down at 135. "
"5627230","5633550"," You know, if XLV trades down to 133 or if it gives back all the gains from yesterday, it might"
"5633550","5634530"," pick that trade up again."
"5634530","5639330"," You're still interested in that trade because there are a lot of healthcare stocks up again this"
"5639330","5639590"," morning."
"5641070","5644070"," So it might not be showing its cards well yet at this point. "
"5646390","5648950"," Viacom selling off another great trade setup."
"5649570","5657570"," If you are looking to get back into the Viacom trade, I'd be looking for a rebuy back in around"
"5657570","5664850"," $33.84. Tag that on your charts right around $33.84. You might get a great trade on."
"5665350","5672590"," If it breaks through with tight stops at $33.84, then look for a sell down to rebuy back in"
"5672590","5681700"," at $32.25. Sometimes we'll swing out of a channel briefly"
"5681700","5686100"," and then you can scoop up a bottom and fertilize another ripper up. "
"5693090","5696070"," Not surprising to see Tesla trading down slightly."
"5696070","5697730"," We'll look at Tesla one more time for you."
"5704100","5705840"," Spies holding support just fine. "
"5706040","5708160"," You can see this nice beautiful red line of support here."
"5710420","5714440"," See how cheap the Tesla calls have become now or spy calls have become."
"5715020","5716140"," I want to see them grind. "
"5717020","5722860"," I really want to see them grind those spy calls down to like 30 cents maybe."
"5722860","5724720"," I know that sounds really greedy."
"5727260","5729240"," We've got a ton of puts right now. "
"5729260","5733600"," A pin on the market on spy just came in at 4.62 p."
"5735620","5738160"," I'm really looking for those calls to be dirt cheap."
"5746820","5749300"," 4.70s for Wednesday are only 30 cents."
"5749540","5750120"," That's getting cheap. "
"5757080","5758880"," What I end up doing is I trade too early."
"5759080","5760300"," I wind up buying them in like 80 cents."
"5760300","5762900"," Like the Friday 4.70s that buy them for 80 cents. "
"5763580","5769120"," And then I wind up going back and buying another rack or two or three for 20 cents to make"
"5769120","5772520"," my dollar cost average down to like 40 cents 30 cents."
"5772720","5774200"," They don't capture the entire trade."
"5775320","5776880"," There must be a patient here in the spy. "
"5778580","5779480"," Watch this grind."
"5779820","5780660"," Just keep on grinding."
"5782180","5784860"," Wear out these button call buyers. "
"5789650","5790750"," Covering up Tesla next."
"5795680","5799300"," Maybe I'll just leave spy up so that I don't have to reload it every time."
"5820650","5821770"," Yeah, it just heads up. "
"5821970","5824870"," There are dip buyers stepping in on AFRM."
"5825850","5828090"," There is some massive flow coming in."
"5828350","5831850"," I'm seeing some XLF puts right now too. "
"5831970","5833790"," That XLF trade was sketchy."
"5833910","5836630"," It looks like they want to print the put side on XLF."
"5837810","5838730"," I would be wary. "
"5838970","5841250"," It looks like they printed yesterday on XLF."
"5841570","5845390"," It looks like they're going to trade down into Friday and then print the put side."
"5845590","5847130"," And then they'll pick it back up again. "
"5847890","5850970"," Be careful of XLF because I've traded it a lot in the past."
"5851870","5855910"," And there's a lot of like boiler rooms that trade it."
"5856050","5858510"," There's a lot of hedge funds like trading XLF. "
"5858970","5861910"," So you have to kind of follow with their trading even if it's going up."
"5862370","5865430"," You'll always see like XLF will trade up into the opening bell."
"5865430","5866490"," You have to sell your calls. "
"5866910","5869870"," And then it sells down and then it goes back up again into the end of the day."
"5870310","5873630"," And then it sells down on the following days right at the open."
"5883060","5885900"," Still seeing calls coming in on Zoom, XOM. "
"5894020","5896280"," I mean, I'm going to look back at AFRM at some point."
"5897280","5899340"," I want to because AFRM prints huge."
"5900000","5902260"," There's a lot of money flow coming into AFRM today. "
"5919380","5921340"," Now I might have to reload this entire book map."
"5933700","5935560"," I'm going to reload this book map real quick."
"5935700","5936680"," See what's going on in my background. "
"5972200","5975700"," The LBS Streamlabs 64 bits running."
"5994740","5997500"," Probably should have restarted my computer yesterday and I didn't."
"6018740","6019620"," Load previously. "
"6020760","6021060"," You know what?"
"6021080","6022380"," I might just restart from the beginning."
"6022680","6023280"," Start from the beginning."
"6024620","6025500"," Start from scratch. "
"6030680","6035540"," See if we can get a level of clean slate here."
"6039600","6040480"," Start with Tesla."
"6040820","6041680"," Yeah, we'll start with Tesla. "
"6058010","6061250"," I've got to clean up the pipes on book maps sometimes."
"6089540","6091220"," I'm already getting a better load already."
"6156920","6163630"," Seeing more calls coming in on on Dish following the same trade. "
"6163630","6175120"," January 21st, 37.5 calls January 21st,"
"6175280","6176640"," 37.5 C."
"6182440","6186320"," Get localized support on Tesla at 1040."
"6187280","6190800"," Sellers above at 1070, 1065, 1080."
"6203890","6205330"," Dish is ripping. "
"6213390","6215290"," Wow, I guess it did rip, huh?"
"6216750","6218830"," Dish just kind of blasted off."
"6241730","6245430"," 1040 on support, 1075, 1080."
"6246370","6247890"," Just kind of bounced around doing its thing. "
"6248330","6250570"," Real sellers on Tesla are above at 1100."
"6252130","6254050"," Same as last week, not too much of a difference."
"6270100","6273600"," Might need to be resetting this computer every day. "
"6276700","6279820"," I mean, it might need to reset this computer or maybe even the stream."
"6280900","6286040"," I think that I'm dedicating this computer to this setup now and I'm not turning it off."
"6286240","6290040"," So I think what I think is happening is that my book map is just draining it. "
"6314180","6316180"," Or reset my internet connection every day."
"6316880","6318880"," Because I'm streaming for like eight straight hours a day."
"6319220","6323140"," I'm sure that my internet service company is not happy with me doing this. "
"6327060","6329940"," I don't think it's just the book map history."
"6330120","6336440"," I think that what it is is I think that it has to do with, so every day I'm running"
"6336440","6337600"," a stream that's eight hours long."
"6338960","6344400"," And I think I need to reset my internet every day, reset my computer every day. "
"6344920","6349280"," Because I've got the internet I'm not resetting, my computer I'm not resetting, and then book map"
"6349280","6350220"," I'm not resetting."
"6351280","6358040"," And I think when I reset all these things it just kind of gives it another chance to start fresh."
"6358560","6359960"," And you know that you get throttled, right?"
"6360440","6363060"," Even if you're paying for the, I'm paying for the absolute best. "
"6363580","6369320"," I've got like 400 or 500 download speeds and I've got like 300 upload."
"6370020","6374960"," But you know the internet service providers if you're really slamming into it that they'll throttle"
"6374960","6377080"," you until you reset your system."
"6380980","6382580"," Run clap, crap cleaner. "
"6382880","6383600"," I'll look that one up."
"6384860","6387040"," I don't think that it's I don't think I've got."
"6387520","6393520"," I know I shouldn't say I don't think I know that when I reset everything that it runs just fine. "
"6394560","6395260"," It's more."
"6397840","6403880"," So I just looked up crap cleaner got it."
"6410760","6419000"," But I don't think it's anything that I'm doing. "
"6419000","6420420"," Sick bounce off 462."
"6421480","6423080"," Gorgeous bounce off 462."
"6429940","6431800"," It's a beautiful thing right there watching that. "
"6441970","6443830"," It's a great day trader bounce right there."
"6448510","6452570"," And I do want to we want to take a look and see if these sellers are still here if"
"6452570","6454150"," they're gone on the spy."
"6457390","6459730"," And it looks like they've come down. "
"6463120","6464240"," No, they're still there."
"6464780","6466020"," Be careful of this rip."
"6466180","6467220"," This is a day trader's rip. "
"6467400","6468400"," This really isn't a."
"6470360","6472780"," Be careful of these sellers hiding above still."
"6481800","6484320"," You want to see that giant red bar just disappear."
"6492500","6496560"," A F.R.M. is going higher from that dip in that call flow that came in. "
"6497880","6505240"," A F.R.M. bounced off 78.99. And a ton of a couple million dollars came in on call"
"6505240","6509240"," flow on a F.R.M. It's going higher now."
"6512560","6516280"," XLNX that call out from earlier they're ripping as well."
"6521490","6524670"," XLVs just kind of bouncing along on support here. "
"6537160","6541200"," Viacom's in a consolidation phase hood still ripping higher."
"6541200","6551250"," It is interesting"
"6551250","6557470"," to see John Deere is just like in a consolidation phase."
"6557630","6559170"," So John Deere had that huge gap up. "
"6559350","6565150"," You got one, two, three, four, five, six days of sideways movement on John Deere."
"6566170","6568170"," So that trade looks like it's played out a little bit."
"6573410","6578930"," This was the John Deere trade is part of that everybody panic and hide, right?"
"6578930","6581170"," It started back here in October. "
"6582070","6584110"," In October 10th it began at 320."
"6585050","6588030"," It's traded up to almost 386 now."
"6588630","6594270"," And then you have the CNBC types coming out there and they say, hey, you guys should all hide in"
"6594270","6596150"," real good trades. "
"6596930","6599350"," So now everybody's loaded up now on John Deere."
"6600330","6602310"," And what's going to happen here?"
"6603270","6607170"," Just trade it up 25% since October."
"6607170","6610770"," And then you've got everybody loading up right now on value trades. "
"6612730","6614730"," After it's got up 25%."
"6623760","6626980"," So you have some minor resistance on Tesla at 1070."
"6627540","6628720"," Your price target's 1100. "
"6637220","6639580"," Buyer's still in control on spy."
"6640620","6641740"," More buyers and sellers."
"6642600","6643940"," Excellent hero indicator. "
"6645040","6649040"," There is a little bit of hesitation as we get close to the sun level up above right."
"6649040","6651560"," You see that the sellers are still there."
"6651760","6654920"," You're looking for these sellers to once again disappear from yesterday. "
"6655860","6657500"," And until then it's a day traders paradise."
"6668880","6670080"," It's biased up now."
"6670500","6671820"," Can I post donut?"
"6671940","6672440"," Yeah, I can post. "
"6673020","6674740"," I can post donut."
"6675020","6676600"," Quinn, you have any trades you want to look at brother?"
"6689020","6694740"," And one more thing on spy is if you look, there goes my dogs outside."
"6697560","6701580"," You'll look for a little bit of support here on spy at 464 43. "
"6702320","6706780"," And then you want to see if we can break above this 466 50."
"6717770","6721030"," It looks like that sellers are moving slightly higher too."
"6721470","6723390"," They were down slightly lower earlier. "
"6723650","6731490"," Just take note of this that they were down at like 459 earlier or 465 59 I believe."
"6731490","6737070"," So somewhere in here is where the sellers were earlier this morning and they seem to be raising up"
"6737070","6737850"," the wall."
"6738410","6740690"," This could be the calls coming into the market as well. "
"6742190","6749590"," So you might have a nice clean bounce here on the spy at 464 37 and then another rip higher"
"6749590","6753350"," to that 466 49."
"6754750","6758890"," So you might be able to pick this trade up on the spy if you missed the first the first"
"6758890","6759550"," rip above."
"6763700","6766620"," That would coincide with Tesla going 10 70 1080. "
"6769140","6771120"," You start to see that across the market."
"6772380","6780080"," I want to check out a FrM."
"6783310","6785710"," See if we can load the second chart this time. "
"6786270","6791670"," If we can't load another chart what I might do is I might have to cancel this live stream and"
"6791670","6793070"," then I'll reload a new live stream."
"6793070","6794690"," What I'll do is I'll reset my internet."
"6794690","6800330"," I'll reset the computer and then I'll do a second live stream able to take a lunch break between 11"
"6800330","6801250"," and 12 o'clock. "
"6801770","6805710"," You guys can go eat some popcorn or something and then we'll get back to it."
"6805770","6807350"," So let's see if we can get a second chart to load up."
"6807590","6811890"," If I can't get a second chart to load up quickly here I'm going to probably read and this one's"
"6811890","6812470"," loading up fast. "
"6813290","6818950"," I probably just needed to get rid of I just probably just needed to do what I did was erase"
"6818950","6820150"," some of the previous history."
"6821030","6825870"," This looks like the buy zone right now right 7845 cell zones 82 bucks."
"6825990","6827650"," I'm still positive on a FrM. "
"6830190","6835090"," There's slightly more buyers within waiting down below it's 76."
"6836590","6839070"," We've got a first resistance at $82."
"6839670","6841450"," Big resistance at 85. "
"6841990","6843790"," Ultimately you're looking for I think it's 90 something."
"6845410","6847330"," Or it looks like the buyers have come down."
"6847470","6848310"," So another at 90. "
"6848610","6854470"," They're at $88.62. $88.62. 70 bucks."
"6857050","6859510"," Day traders are sitting around down here at 78."
"6868500","6870440"," Yeah, crude shouldn't give a fuck. "
"6871220","6871980"," Crude is outstanding."
"6872540","6875380"," Crude any of the oil trades, any of the energy trades are outstanding."
"6876220","6877220"," Look at XLE real quick. "
"6896780","6901820"," There's calls coming in all morning long and all the oil companies gas companies right from the"
"6901820","6902020"," bell."
"6902940","6906080"," It's a weird thing too when you're trading oil in the cash market."
"6908400","6910500"," It's important to time your trades. "
"6916700","6919840"," Real support on XLE is at $58."
"6921020","6923020"," The sky's the limit on XLE."
"6928280","6935480"," The summer or the spring I called for a hundred bucks a gallon on oil and I was laughed out"
"6935480","6935820"," of the room. "
"6935960","6936760"," I got my timing wrong."
"6936900","6940100"," I think I posted that in winter of 2021."
"6941160","6945160"," And I said by summer would be a hundred bucks a gallon, which it wasn't. "
"6945620","6946200"," It got high."
"6946380","6949960"," I think it got the 70 bucks, but it's still close."
"6949960","6952800"," We're going to get to a hundred bucks a gallon or a barrel. "
"6953020","6953680"," Not a gallon of barrel."
"6954200","6957240"," And it's to be expected."
"6959900","6962760"," XLE really is at a top localized top right now. "
"6963220","6971480"," If you do see XLE cool off at some point, if you can grab XLE at 58 bucks, that's the"
"6971480","6972080"," place, right?"
"6972840","6974820"," If you can buy it at 58, good luck."
"6975060","6976760"," If not, it could just rip higher."
"6976960","6978240"," There's no real sailing right now. "
"6978240","6980880"," There's some, so there's some puts."
"6982260","6983620"," Yeah, it's 62 bucks."
"6984060","6987640"," This could be an easy short at this point where it's at right now. "
"6987720","6992440"," But I would expect that XLE has got a green bar straight to the top and a close today."
"6993020","6994120"," That's my real take."
"6994280","6997220"," I think we green bar it straight up to the end of the day today on XLE. "
"6997700","7001960"," Probably tag it out at 62, 63 bucks already at 62 right now."
"7002560","7004040"," I'm saying things that are already happening."
"7006160","7008060"," And it is green barring it up right now. "
"7008800","7010340"," Maybe 62, 63."
"7010740","7012380"," Let's see where the calls are on XLE."
"7015080","7016300"," It's kind of crazy. "
"7020470","7022350"," Yeah, everybody's loaded up at 59."
"7022790","7029150"," So just the heads up, the trade on, just the heads up, the trade on XLE was at $59.58."
"7030510","7032250"," They're going to take profit at some point."
"7032690","7033530"," Just know that, okay?"
"7036210","7040430"," You've got some late FOMO buyers coming in, hoping for 63. "
"7043910","7045510"," I'm going to expect this is a look."
"7045710","7050210"," I'm going to propose that this is a localized top for XLE right here."
"7050950","7051630"," That could be wrong. "
"7052170","7055530"," You might rip higher to like $63, maybe $64."
"7056550","7058490"," You can check the options channel this."
"7059090","7060970"," But this trade started back at 58 bucks. "
"7060970","7062390"," So just be conscious of that."
"7063270","7066530"," This trade actually started at $55."
"7067490","7068190"," It's up to 62. "
"7069230","7070190"," Just be careful."
"7070390","7072610"," It's 20% move in like 10 days."
"7073510","7074750"," The big move. "
"7083770","7085290"," Spy's ripping right now."
"7090870","7094370"," So everybody was in puts on spy today."
"7094370","7096650"," Looks like the spy trade was the call trade. "
"7097590","7107470"," I want you to see right here that the sellers keep creeping higher"
"7107470","7108010"," and higher."
"7108670","7121190"," The sellers are now up to 466.57. I"
"7121190","7128070"," also want you to be aware that we take a look at something here and show you guys or tell"
"7128070","7130770"," you guys where the vol flip is."
"7147920","7153980"," So it's just so that you know the volatility triggers that basically 4700. "
"7154320","7156960"," It's between 4700 and 4714."
"7157600","7159980"," It's kind of like, you know, hang grenades and horseshoes."
"7160700","7166740"," If we are able to rip up to 4700, you will see a Vanna trade. "
"7168100","7174200"," All right, you guys, guess who you could say if we get above this sell wall that we're moving into"
"7174200","7181700"," right now at 466.53. If we break above this area here, I would take my, I would take your"
"7181700","7190900"," gains right now at 466.56. Jump back on the trade above 466.82 and then ride it to 4700."
"7194040","7195200"," You guys all paying attention."
"7195340","7196920"," This is important stuff for you guys to know. "
"7198360","7200260"," You take this long trade from down below."
"7200440","7205180"," You take your profit right here at 46.6.54. Take your money."
"7205600","7209580"," You wait until we trade above 46.6.82 and then you ride it up. "
"7225020","7226720"," Okay, so you take your profits here."
"7227060","7229140"," Take your money right now if you're in an FD."
"7230880","7237120"," You're going to wait for it for the move above 46.685. Now, there is some money lost in that"
"7237120","7242280"," trade if we break above, but there's usually some sort of grinding here in this area. "
"7242740","7243940"," If we're going to trade above here."
"7244920","7247600"," If you're bearish, you could take the opposite trade here."
"7248380","7251600"," But we do have buyers consuming sellers. "
"7252400","7255520"," We have the hero indicator turning very positive right now."
"7256060","7258820"," You'll probably see this red bar disappear at some point."
"7274180","7276660"," Remember that FDs are only as good as the move. "
"7277460","7282400"," So if we tap here and start to grind sideways, your FDs will lose value."
"7282620","7283620"," Be conscious of that."
"7291350","7295890"," You'll want to pick the FD up once again after we break through resistance. "
"7301480","7304100"," Tesla is now coming into that 1070 level."
"7305540","7307480"," So I'll check Tesla for you real quick."
"7308360","7309660"," They are coinciding, right?"
"7309760","7312920"," We're talking about both of those tickers coinciding earlier. "
"7314300","7316460"," So we'll look at Tesla and see if it's going to break through."
"7317400","7318260"," It's a nice pear trade."
"7330840","7332200"," XLV has found its legs. "
"7332440","7333400"," It's bouncing as well."
"7333940","7336460"," That'll help fuel the spy rip through resistance."
"7343650","7344610"," XLE is ripping. "
"7349360","7350820"," Dish is selling off slightly."
"7351480","7355800"," What I said earlier about dish was wait for it to trade down to 33, I think."
"7356660","7357960"," 3350 or somewhere in there. "
"7358560","7365020"," If you're going to take a dish trade, you're looking for 3374."
"7365980","7370000"," So if you want to follow all those people that are buying dish calls."
"7374690","7377450"," XLNX, which we talked about earlier, they're ripping much higher. "
"7377810","7379850"," XLNX we called out a call play earlier."
"7380710","7382270"," They are blasting off right now."
"7390160","7392220"," XLV is blasting off right now. "
"7393360","7395360"," AFRM is making its way back up."
"7396660","7400400"," Their ultimate price target is somewhere around 92, I believe, $91."
"7401460","7401940"," That's it. "
"7402040","7402900"," That'll be a huge move."
"7404780","7406240"," VICOM is still selling off."
"7406780","7411600"," We said earlier to look for a tap below at 3387. "
"7411780","7414440"," Keep that on your charts so you get an email alert on that."
"7419860","7422680"," You should see this nice grind right here, right?"
"7423100","7428220"," So you get out of your FDs and you're looking for a break above 4690."
"7429200","7434560"," If we break above here, you can pick this back up again and you'll make some bank again on FDs. "
"7440420","7442480"," Yeah, QT delayed all-time highs."
"7444260","7445380"," QT delayed."
"7448460","7452380"," He did drop a hint. "
"7452740","7453440"," Faraz is correct."
"7455100","7458280"," He dropped the hint yesterday in the press release."
"7459080","7463800"," I posted that on Twitter yesterday and I didn't get a lot of traction on that post and people need"
"7463800","7471140"," to understand that when he drops those little lines in there, things that he says about his tools"
"7471140","7472140"," are still available. "
"7473140","7475360"," That's the tilt in the hand right there."
"7476100","7477040"," He can drain the plug."
"7477540","7482000"," He can put the plug back in all that kind of stuff, but the moment that the faucets actually turned"
"7482000","7484520"," off is when you really need to have some real fear. "
"7485100","7488240"," And he's telling you, basically, we can't turn the faucet off."
"7489840","7491100"," That's basically what he's saying."
"7491100","7498060"," And we're trading down this market in the anticipation of the FOMC minutes where they're talking in"
"7498060","7501040"," the background, they're saying, yeah, we're going to turn off the faucet. "
"7501320","7506320"," Not only are we going to unplug it, the tub, we're going to turn the faucet off."
"7506880","7508740"," And that's where the panic selling comes in."
"7509080","7512700"," But in reality, yesterday, he says something completely different. "
"7512900","7515120"," He says, we still have these tools."
"7515860","7521660"," And when he says that, it is key to hear that, because if he didn't say that in his prepared"
"7521660","7524760"," remarks, then that means QT is on, right?"
"7524920","7530020"," That means that not only are we not only pulling the plug in the tub, but we're also going to"
"7530020","7531460"," turn the faucet completely off."
"7531820","7534220"," And that's where a bear thrives. "
"7535580","7537600"," And so we are starting to break through right now."
"7537660","7538640"," I do want you to see that."
"7539140","7541160"," We have more way more buyers stepping in. "
"7541300","7545540"," We have a hero indicator that's starting to just build and build and build and build at this point."
"7546040","7547700"," We are at resistance level."
"7548320","7549780"," This is a great trade, by the way. "
"7554800","7556540"," Everybody's loaded up on puts, of course."
"7557200","7561840"," I mean, you could pretty much trade these events and just trade the opposite side of the trade that"
"7561840","7564880"," everybody is on, and it prints almost every single time."
"7565020","7571180"," This would be the sixth event that we've traded where the opposite trade, the contrarian trade, has"
"7571180","7574600"," printed way better than the trade everybody else is in. "
"7575260","7579040"," It's almost like they're front running it down, and then they don't front run it back up."
"7585350","7586750"," And they basically can't lose."
"7594300","7596980"," And you can see the buyers stepping in and mass here. "
"7597480","7601600"," They're buying straight at 4.66.62. They're ready to crush it."
"7608340","7613020"," And now if we break through here, the question becomes, if you're a bull, where do we trade to?"
"7613420","7614240"," That's the big question."
"7614840","7619800"," So if we're able to break through this level right here, we turn this into support at 4.62. Ask"
"7619800","7620660"," yourself in your mind. "
"7621440","7624160"," Say, what are we thinking at this point?"
"7625120","7628080"," Are we thinking that we're going to trade to 500?"
"7629160","7630820"," I don't see that in my mind."
"7632860","7636480"," Is the trade to 500 because we might have a good ER season?"
"7638280","7639620"," Maybe you trade to 500?"
"7639980","7642960"," Maybe we attempt to trade to 470, 480."
"7643820","7644620"," So maybe the move here. "
"7645700","7649440"," If we trade above, I would think we trade to 470."
"7649440","7652500"," We trade sideways."
"7653860","7657440"," And if we have a good earring season, we trade up to 4.78, 480. "
"7658720","7660500"," I think a bull could stomach that."
"7661520","7663560"," And do we really trade to 500?"
"7664740","7665520"," Probably not."
"7665920","7669800"," So then you're looking towards, let's say we look towards a 480 trade. "
"7670440","7674160"," Or let's say we look towards a 470 trade this week."
"7674160","7675960"," The Vanner Rally trade to 470."
"7676440","7678580"," We trade down into OPEX. "
"7680060","7685280"," Or maybe it's 4.78. Maybe we trade to 4.78. We're down on OPEX to 470."
"7686340","7689280"," And then we have that one ripper of another day on Thursday of OPEX."
"7691180","7691860"," I don't know. "
"7692020","7692880"," We're going to see right now."
"7693520","7696100"," So if you were in FDs, hopefully you took profit here."
"7697400","7698360"," You're forewarned. "
"7698460","7703700"," Take profit here at 4.66. And then we're going to pick this trade back up if we can break"
"7703700","7704060"," above."
"7704620","7717750"," We can break above 4.66.83. If"
"7717750","7721750"," we can break above 4.66.83 here, I'll pick this trade back up again."
"7732600","7734520"," 4.66.83, trust me. "
"7734800","7736000"," You pick that long up again."
"7736460","7738760"," And then what we'll do is we'll trade it up and look for another."
"7741500","7744480"," We'll look for another resistance zone above here at 470. "
"7745320","7746680"," See, this is all ice up here."
"7746680","7754200"," These are more sellers hiding all the way until you get to 4.71.27. Then you'll have to have"
"7754200","7754760"," clear skies above."
"7764230","7769730"," Anyone that's in those calls that we called out yesterday were in the spy, you must be printing fat"
"7769730","7774360"," as interest kicks in around here. "
"7794740","7799440"," Flowago has some team calls coming in, T-E-A-M."
"7799440","7802120"," January 21st, 340C."
"7802780","7803940"," Lots of interest there. "
"7804500","7806360"," Mara has some calls coming in."
"7806480","7807100"," Watch out, Quinn."
"7807960","7810120"," January 14th, 33C. "
"7814760","7816800"," More calls coming in on DKNG."
"7817200","7818620"," PBR has some calls coming in."
"7820360","7826740"," MDB, Mike, Delta, Bravo, 470C, expiring on January 21st. "
"7828240","7831040"," B-A has some light call activity coming in."
"7832080","7842060"," B-A calls that January 14th, 217.5. But team looks like a trade."
"7842480","7849200"," It has a high algo score, T-E-A-M, January 21st, 340C. "
"7855010","7858250"," And you're going to wait to pick these calls up until we break above here, okay?"
"7859010","7864390"," If you're an FD trader, day trader like me, you're going to be waiting here in the spy to do"
"7864390","7865050"," it to break above."
"7865510","7866390"," I'm going to take a quick break."
"7866990","7868030"," I'm going to come back on. "
"7868310","7869530"," It's 1127."
"7873760","7874480"," Quinn Spitz."
"7877420","7878640"," V-Y-N. "
"7883740","7884900"," So I'm going to do this."
"7884960","7885540"," I'm going to take a break."
"7886520","7888760"," Yeah, you guys, I appreciate that comment, Cody. "
"7889500","7892520"," I hope you guys are trading much better than you have been in the past."
"7894480","7898060"," I hope you guys are no one where to take your trades, where to get out of your trades."
"7898640","7902980"," Let's look at Tesla real quick for the Tesla gang, and then I'll look at the Amazon trade because"
"7902980","7904100"," it was having a difficult time. "
"7904480","7906980"," Hey, you've seen that nice bounce on 10-1070 up here."
"7907320","7908760"," We talked about this earlier, right?"
"7909440","7910960"," This resistance at 1070."
"7911320","7913240"," You guys should have been able to get out of your trades there. "
"7913620","7916680"," You got V-Wup down below on Tesla at 1059."
"7917300","7919340"," You know the real support is below a 1050."
"7920020","7921560"," What are you trying to break through, right?"
"7921560","7923800"," You guys want to re-pick up a Tesla trade?"
"7924280","7925900"," And we can tell you where that is, right?"
"7926160","7929800"," You want to ride, let's say you're getting crazy on Tesla and you want to ride it up higher. "
"7930340","7931800"," You got a resistance at 1074."
"7932540","7934540"," You have light resistance above at 1079."
"7935200","7939400"," Your ultimate price target is still again, once again this week, up at 1100, I believe. "
"7939920","7941040"," It's actually come down slightly."
"7942040","7951160"," No, it's 1102.57, or excuse me, 1098.35. We'll bring up Amazon real quick."
"7951580","7953680"," I'm going to cut this feed off at some point. "
"7954100","7957800"," I'm going to come back at the 12 o'clock hour, or make it 1230."
"7957980","7958360"," I need an hour."
"7958460","7959160"," I need to have some lunch. "
"7960060","7960980"," But I'm going to bring up Amazon."
"7961640","7963260"," I'm going to try to reset my internet."
"7963260","7969160"," I'm going to try to reset my computer and book map because I don't want this lagging for you guys. "
"7969920","7972400"," And I want to be able to do this every single day for you guys."
"7972540","7974120"," Make sure that we have accurate information."
"7974320","7976080"," You guys know where to pick a spy up, right?"
"7976540","7978580"," I mean, this is, we've talked about this. "
"7979080","7984020"," You guys know that if we break above, I want you to remember, if we break above 466, it looks"
"7984020","7987180"," like 80, 466, 83, or so."
"7987620","7990140"," If this breaks above, you can pick FDs up again."
"7990680","7993560"," And I'll be back to show you where the resistance above will be. "
"7994060","7996600"," The key is going to be that we need to get above 470."
"7997340","7999520"," I think in Vasco was talking about that down in the comments."
"8001520","8003020"," I'll be floundering without the help. "
"8005320","8006660"," There's more spoofing on NQ."
"8006820","8010880"," The other thing I'm going to do for you guys is I'm going to buy the, I have to pay"
"8010880","8011240"," for this."
"8011440","8015200"," It's going to, it costs a lot of money, but I'm going to buy the spoofing add-on for book"
"8015200","8016160"," map next. "
"8016540","8019820"," And that will show you where all the fake orders are for cells for cells."
"8020360","8025320"," So we'll see, we'll be able to see if, if there really is true resistance at certain levels."
"8026600","8028900"," Amazon is just bashing right now. "
"8028900","8031120"," Bashing above 3300."
"8031940","8034560"," Just ripping through resistance levels above."
"8035380","8036940"," Thanks for that shout-out call. "
"8037520","8040780"," You do have some more resistance above here at 3315."
"8041540","8042720"," Light resistance here."
"8043040","8048360"," If you're able to break above this level here, your next target is going to be 3350. "
"8050180","8050820"," 3350."
"8050820","8053460"," You do have sellers here right now currently on Amazon."
"8054020","8056020"," That's a nice round number 3300. "
"8056400","8059420"," But your next price target on Amazon is 3350."
"8060000","8063020"," Know that the bank money is down below in this trade at 3200."
"8067470","8070550"," Should I, should I sign off real quick with my WNBC?"
"8071130","8072170"," Just signing off for lunch. "
"8077360","8078560"," What are FDs?"
"8079920","8080680"," Financial derivatives."
"8082720","8086920"," I can't call them what they are known as."
"8087180","8088780"," It is not nice. "
"8088780","8089020"," It's not nice."
"8093380","8097800"," If I was in a, you know, if I was, I don't actually say those words anymore."
"8097880","8098420"," I used to Sam. "
"8098920","8102660"," They even said them recently and are not Sam, but I would post them."
"8103120","8104140"," But I don't like saying them anyway."
"8104540","8104900"," Not nice. "
"8106840","8107900"," It's a vulgar term."
"8115080","8116260"," Yeah, financial derivative."
"8117120","8118320"," That's what it really means. "
"8118740","8119100"," Arbitrage."
"8129280","8130820"," Rejected at reject."
"8131300","8132200"," No, not really rejected. "
"8132200","8133260"," We're not really rejected."
"8134160","8135180"," We're not rejected."
"8136780","8138100"," This is consolidation. "
"8138540","8139840"," I want you guys to realize that."
"8140100","8141040"," Let me show you real quick."
"8141420","8142380"," It's a good question, actually. "
"8142580","8146060"," Chase is saying book map rejected 466."
"8147320","8148780"," Nothing here is saying rejection."
"8149180","8152600"," You're seeing buyers overcome sellers on spy. "
"8153280","8157940"," You're seeing the hero indicators saying that we're logging the market right now."
"8158600","8163980"," And so what you're going to normally see at this level is you'll see a grind, right?"
"8164160","8165380"," You'll see absorption of sellers."
"8165860","8170460"," You'll see support be created here at 467 and then you'll see another move higher. "
"8172180","8173400"," So I wouldn't call this rejection."
"8174480","8179900"," You would want, if you saw rejection, you would see us ricochet, crash up here, and you would see"
"8179900","8181260"," an immediate rejection down."
"8181260","8182460"," It doesn't take long. "
"8182580","8183540"," It takes like five minutes."
"8183980","8185900"," If you see a hard wall, you'll know it."
"8186100","8189180"," You'll see a, you'll see us bash into it in an immediate rejection. "
"8189740","8193799"," You'll also see sometimes this red bar will come lower."
"8194200","8196799"," You'll see us actually, you'll see it actually swoop down."
"8197240","8202719"," You'll see a break on the right hand side here and you'll see sellers step in and force. "
"8203340","8209440"," So right now, I'm not saying that we can't reject here, but right now, this shows that we are"
"8209440","8212920"," absorbing sellers for creating a new support level on the spy."
"8213820","8218180"," Now that we did recheck below and that our move is more than likely higher at this point."
"8219660","8220160"," Exactly. "
"8220580","8221080"," Absorption."
"8221620","8222600"," Tell him T-Chrone."
"8229320","8231020"," This is a safe space. "
"8237010","8237690"," Yeah, yeah."
"8237690","8243389"," So I trade zero dates, one dates and three dates, the same ways on the spy."
"8244629","8250670"," I'll consider a zero date option on, let's say a stock only has a weekly or a bi-weekly or"
"8250670","8256990"," a monthly option, whatever the closest option that's expiring, they are different. "
"8257309","8260950"," A zero date option is so many mechanics into it."
"8261290","8262690"," They're different than a one or three day."
"8262690","8269389"," I probably should do a better job of saying one, zero and three or differentiating, but I do mean"
"8269389","8271629"," the closest expiring option. "
"8272230","8275430"," And as you get closer to zero dates itself, they're true zero day."
"8275770","8277410"," They become even more riskier."
"8277690","8282129"," I probably need to do a better job of separating those terms. "
"8285440","8289320"," And especially the mechanics on the inside of them, because I know the mechanics of the inside of"
"8289320","8291400"," those trades, but not everybody does."
"8291719","8293420"," Some of you guys do, but some of you guys don't."
"8293420","8300120"," So even earlier what I was saying, I don't like the price of a spy zero date at 80 cents"
"8300120","8301219"," or a dollar or a dollar. "
"8301480","8303080"," I think it was up to a dollar 21 point."
"8303540","8307980"," I want to see him down in the 20s and like if we're two days away for like the Wednesday,"
"8308520","8311959"," I really want to see him at like 60, 70 cents if they're three, four days away."
"8312580","8314080"," You know, no more than a dollar or so. "
"8315820","8317780"," I need to do a video on that stuff for you guys."
"8318559","8324080"," If I'm like a zero zero date, I'm watching him flex between like 20 cents, 30 cents."
"8324219","8325219"," They might start at 50 cents. "
"8325700","8329459"," And then they'll eventually work themselves down to zero cents at the end of the day on the actual"
"8329459","8329980"," zero date."
"8330360","8334160"," So you want to trade inside of that band range that range that they trade at."
"8335440","8337760"," Yeah, we're looking at looking like we're breaking through right now. "
"8338020","8339180"," Just a heads up to all of you out there."
"8339820","8341260"," Major buyers coming in."
"8341260","8345600"," We are about to. "
"8345920","8350740"," The price we're talking about here is 4, 6, 6, 8, 1."
"8352360","8354059"," I want you to watch the price."
"8354500","8356200"," We're at 4, 6, 6, 6, 0."
"8356780","8359379"," You pick this back up in the next 20 cents."
"8360719","8362059"," Next nine cents now. "
"8362200","8363440"," We're at 4, 6, 6, 70."
"8364160","8365120"," Be conscious of this."
"8365360","8365480"," Okay. "
"8365600","8368740"," I want you to be careful in your timing of trades."
"8368740","8373780"," You want to see us break above and hold 4, 6, 6, 8, 1."
"8374420","8376059"," It's a critical actual number."
"8378660","8380480"," Not 4, 6, 6, 7, 7."
"8380860","8382620"," Not 4, 6, 6, 7, 5."
"8383139","8385219"," Not 4, 6, 6, 7, you know, whatever. "
"8385639","8386840"," We just broke above now."
"8387580","8389720"," We're breaking above 4, 6, 6, 8, 4."
"8390260","8392020"," We touched for a brief moment."
"8392600","8393920"," 4, 6, 6, 8, 9."
"8394720","8395800"," We touched it again. "
"8396000","8396420"," We're now above."
"8397360","8399620"," So you would pick this trade up at this moment right here."
"8399620","8401320"," You have clear skies above. "
"8402020","8403660"," We are going to rip much higher."
"8403680","8407000"," It looks like at this point all sellers have been absorbed."
"8407620","8408240"," We're cranking. "
"8408400","8410340"," We've got 180,000 buyers right here."
"8410920","8413680"," And let's see if we can break through and hold this right now."
"8414420","8415940"," It's a critical key moment. "
"8416480","8419280"," Let's see if the sellers have moved above at any point."
"8424220","8427900"," And we've got a new blue bar above at 4, 79 again."
"8428140","8429040"," We've seen this before. "
"8436380","8437820"," This is a point here."
"8437820","8443920"," I want you to be aware that you're going to see short covering begin to start at this point on"
"8443920","8444340"," the spy."
"8449650","8454850"," Anywhere from here to 470 will fuel a major Vanna rally. "
"8455210","8455870"," You're talking about."
"8456390","8462470"," So if we break through, let's say we break through from here to, we'll give you a defined number."
"8463090","8472230"," You're going to see a short rally from 4, 69.04. We will blast off. "
"8472490","8473950"," We will rip to 478."
"8474770","8477630"," Shorts are all balls deep in at 470."
"8478490","8487300"," And the next round of bang shorts are at 475.39 or so. "
"8487960","8492340"," 475.39 is your next key level for squeezes."
"8493160","8500240"," So if you'll fuel some short squeezing today that would rip up into the 470 area."
"8500840","8506140"," And then if there's more covering happening at 470, you'll see another squeeze up to 475. "
"8507220","8511220"," And that fuel 475 would squeeze this up to probably 478."
"8513430","8516810"," That is definitely on the table unless some news comes out that we don't know."
"8518630","8519610"," Congratulations bulls. "
"8520710","8521070"," Start printing."

"8613360","8614720"," Anyone can become a member of this sub."

"8619480","8620480"," wall street bets days."
"8620480","8623120"," I was an old school wall street bets member from the beginning. "
"8623800","8625180"," Wall street bets went out the door."
"8625600","8629600"," If you guys want to have some kind of a group like that, some kind of a trading group where"
"8629600","8632240"," we're all helping each other make money that's positive."
"8632460","8633300"," We're not snarky. "
"8633540","8639220"," We're not behind the scenes putting out bullshit that nobody can understand that they're actionable"
"8639220","8641100"," trades where you're actually making money."
"8641500","8642200"," You're paying your bills."
"8642460","8645040"," You're paying into retirement for yourself. "
"8645040","8648260"," You're winning as a retail trader against the banks that are out there."
"8653080","8653920"," Here we go, guys."
"8654220","8654580"," Make money. "
"8662860","8663620"," You guys are awesome."
"8664120","8664620"," I love you guys."
"8664800","8666060"," You guys are all making money around here. "
"8666140","8666500"," I like that."
"8668820","8671220"," And you see Spy ripping higher now at this point."
"8671760","8674240"," We know that they can't turn the money supply off. "
"8674760","8676380"," We know that we traded the market down."
"8676980","8679920"," And I still think we have tail risks on the menu here."
"8680280","8682480"," I still think we trade down after ER. "
"8683060","8684680"," I think we find a bottom this year."
"8684680","8687520"," I think we find a bottom between now and March, right?"
"8687640","8689020"," We do sell off this market."
"8689440","8690200"," We start over. "
"8690420","8692700"," Maybe we only make 6% and we have reasonable gains."
"8693260","8693800"," And then you hedge."
"8694600","8697000"," You're going to end up hedging this market at some point with me. "
"8697280","8700480"," We're going to do this together for that tail risk."
"8700840","8705460"," If you're a bear out there, why would you not hedge this market and not lose all your money?"
"8705980","8709260"," If you're a bull, why would you not hedge this market and not lose all your money?"
"8710000","8713880"," And if you're a bear and a bull, we can trade both sides of this trade together."
"8715540","8720020"," I'll turn all of you guys into traders, investors that can take both sides of the investment. "
"8720860","8725180"," You guys can know when to buy the bottoms, know when to sell the tops when the banks do, and"
"8725180","8725780"," make money."
"8726180","8727840"," Because that's really at the end of the day, all that matters."
"8728460","8733220"," All the bullshit you hear on social media, all the shit that you hear on Twitter, all the shit that"
"8733220","8735040"," you hear on Wall Street bets everywhere else, right?"
"8735760","8739380"," Everyone sounds smart, but they don't tell you what's in their bank account. "
"8739860","8743280"," And the real thing that matters at the end of the day, is it matters that you can pay for"
"8743280","8747660"," your lights to be on, that you can pay for your mortgage, that you can pay for your car, you"
"8747660","8751260"," can pay for your kid's shit, you can take your girlfriend out for a date, your boyfriend out for a"
"8751260","8751500"," date."
"8751940","8753100"," All that stuff is all that matters."
"8753780","8759280"," You know, that guy that you see on Twitter that's given you some kind of crystal ball to look at"
"8759280","8763160"," but doesn't give you an answer as to how the market's going to actually trade, that guy doesn't pay"
"8763160","8763760"," for your shit. "
"8764500","8766220"," Only you do, right?"
"8766580","8771300"," So you need to have the answers and the actual intelligence that you need to make those trades for"
"8771300","8771700"," yourself."
"8777780","8779320"," At the end of the day, you laugh at that guy."
"8779420","8779900"," That's what I do. "
"8780040","8781980"," When I see those guys on Twitter, that's what I do."
"8782280","8786420"," I laugh my ass off at those guys, because those guys aren't telling you where we're going or what's"
"8786420","8786840"," going to happen."
"8787320","8787720"," That's insane. "
"8788380","8788600"," I don't know."
"8788700","8788920"," I don't know."
"8789200","8791080"," I got a real bone to pick about this stuff. "
"8792520","8794340"," Because the end of the day, it ends up burning my account."
"8795120","8798940"," And my account is most important to me and your account is most important to you."
"8806430","8807510"," You're welcome, Will, no problem. "
"8812330","8814210"," Thank you, BTCCK."
"8815030","8815470"," BTCCK."
"8820310","8821930"," Yeah, the trust me, bros. "
"8822370","8823690"," The trust me, bros."
"8824630","8830530"," Then I like the smart guys out there that post the cryptic messages, but they don't tell you what"
"8830530","8830810"," it means."
"8831570","8832850"," And so then I go down this rabbit hole. "
"8833250","8834610"," I got Joe Donut and I the other day."
"8835010","8837910"," I shared a document with Joe Donut with him the other day."
"8838290","8843910"," It was nothing but big words, complicated statements, but it doesn't tell you what it means. "
"8844250","8847590"," Like, what is the actionable intelligence from this paper that I'm reading right now?"
"8848030","8852350"," So I have to go down this rabbit hole, figure it all out, find out how to make this trade,"
"8852790","8856130"," find out how to protect myself, and then find out which way we're actually going, right?"
"8857110","8858370"," I hear that too much."
"8858950","8860170"," I hear it all the time out there."
"8860970","8861470"," And here we go. "
"8861570","8862850"," We're trading much higher now on the spy."
"8863270","8866010"," The spy is just effing ripping."
"8869730","8872530"," Pick that trade back up after we break through resistance. "
"8873190","8876670"," You guys should be printing like, you guys should be print, print, print right now."
"8885920","8887540"," You want to talk about a complicated trade."
"8887760","8888460"," We took it from the bottom. "
"8888980","8892640"," We hit resistance, get out of the trade, jump back in and start printing once again."
"8900000","8901600"," How do you say a burr?"
"8906620","8909000"," I want you to look back now on this trade."
"8909540","8913260"," Right back here, you've got 466.78 is the support. "
"8913740","8919180"," It's not showing it here, but you will have some force former support somewhere down here at this"
"8919180","8920720"," 4668, right?"
"8921000","8924840"," So if you see a bounce come down here, you're still going to be looking to take this trade long."
"8928950","8930570"," I want you to also pay attention."
"8930570","8938330"," There is some slight spy puts coming in, $65,000, $112, 465p. "
"8938690","8942330"," Someone's going to be looking for a bounce or for the rip to stop at some point."
"8944800","8946620"," For a little bit of a rest down below."
"8946920","8949060"," Remember that number 466.87?"
"8949680","8956720"," Your next next price target above is going to be 469.05. To take your money right now and run,"
"8957080","8961140"," wait for a slight dip, and then run this back up again to 469. "
"8964240","8964900"," Burr, baby."
"8974320","8978760"," If you aren't in a trade right now in the spy, and you're looking for a place to take the"
"8978760","8989440"," bounce, you're going to be looking for a bounce at 466.77, 466 "
"8989440","8990900",".55 somewhere in there."
"8991420","8996280"," If you see us come back down, you'll see another, you should be looking for another bounce in that"
"8996280","8996540"," area. "
"8999660","9005940"," I've got another level here that's traditional charting that's at 466.92. Pay attention to that one"
"9005940","9006200"," too."
"9018780","9026260"," AFRMs topping out a little bit at 82.58. You might get a little bit of a breather here."
"9026720","9028560"," You've got some MGM calls coming in. "
"9028700","9029720"," Someone was liking MGM."
"9030320","9032600"," MGM March 18th, 45C."
"9033380","9034840"," Has a high algo score. "
"9037720","9040580"," MGM March 18th, 45C."
"9041120","9042660"," That's $300,000."
"9044380","9046480"," Nike has some calls coming in. "
"9047380","9058680"," January 14th, 152.5C. I think someone"
"9058680","9060020"," mentioned BKKT."
"9060920","9063820"," They've got January 14th, 7C."
"9066220","9067900"," We have T-O-L-T. "
"9068600","9070420"," So it's Tango, Oscar, Lima."
"9071280","9073240"," January 14th, 66C."
"9074380","9080340"," Somebody's trading $250,000 on a $66 stock. "
"9081100","9082120"," Look that one up."
"9082120","9089280"," It says both Ford and Facebook popping off."
"9093300","9096820"," Just read that on Flow Algo. "
"9097140","9098420"," Keep an eye on those two, I guess."
"9114070","9132500"," You're seeing a bounce here right on that 466.96. So"
"9132500","9133720"," I can go back here real quick."
"9133920","9136200"," Let's go back and see where that support was built at. "
"9140020","9156900"," So we're looking back here at 466.79. Spy"
"9156900","9158700"," now has a resting bitch face."
"9159480","9160460"," No offense."
"9161900","9163780"," Resting bastard face maybe. "
"9167280","9169400"," Your VWAP on Spy."
"9170100","9172160"," Let's take a look at VWAP real quick."
"9174180","9176320"," Day traders like trading the VWAP. "
"9176760","9181820"," Now people make fun of the VWAP, but I'll let you know that it is respected by day traders."
"9181820","9190520"," 464.59. Let's call that the BTFD."
"9190960","9197380"," So if you're by the dip is right now in 466.97, your by the fucking dip is at 464 "
"9197380","9207360",".59. So you could take on some calls here and then"
"9207360","9215640"," average down somewhere around this 464.59. If you're risk-adversive, completely risk-adversive, you"
"9215640","9221080"," want to wait for your next trade, you're going to probably dip below this for this VWAP. "
"9221380","9225480"," Some traders like to buy the bottom of a, not just the bottom, or the tag of a VWAP they"
"9225480","9227100"," like to buy below the VWAP slightly."
"9229520","9235220"," You know, of all the indicators that are out there, if you're a day trader, if you guys watch VWAP,"
"9236040","9237560"," it's consistent in day trade."
"9237760","9242820"," And it's not consistent 100% of the time, but it's paid attention to by a lot of day traders"
"9242820","9243340"," out there. "
"9243800","9250040"," I used to trade the EMA's, the simple moving averages, in conjunction with VWAP, and now I just use"
"9250040","9250500"," book map."
"9250820","9256240"," But if you're not using book map and you're looking for something to trade on, the simple moving"
"9256240","9263120"," averages tied in with a VWAP, people ask me all the time, do you use RSI, do you use this,"
"9263340","9264620"," use that, and I don't."
"9265180","9270900"," And when I did use candlestick charts for trading, I used VWAP against some simple moving averages. "
"9272060","9275300"," It works like 60% of the time, 70% of the time."
"9276460","9281460"," The thing that always would get me, though, would be the, under the surface moves that were on book"
"9281460","9281660"," map."
"9285060","9286360"," Today's a prime example, right?"
"9286820","9290960"," How many of you guys out there, we would have had that second bounce today, would have thought to"
"9290960","9294120"," yourself we're selling down at this moment, because I probably would have. "
"9294500","9298940"," If it was me trading without the end of the surface stuff, I would have been like, nope, fuck this,"
"9299120","9299960"," we're selling down to 450."
"9301840","9306400"," So when you start to layer all this stuff, it does give a better picture of where we're actually"
"9306400","9306740"," going."
"9314950","9315390"," Yeah. "
"9316550","9316990"," Yeah."
"9317150","9319130"," And that's what saying VWAP is a good tool with up to."
"9319270","9321790"," I used two standard deviations, but I like three better. "
"9322550","9324590"," Three is that, three is that slip below."
"9324970","9333210"," You should expect two standard deviations, but then a risk adverse trader will look for the third"
"9333210","9335450"," standard deviation for the big trades."
"9335450","9340230"," Once you break through that third one, or into that third one, that's the big trade, usually. "
"9344860","9345260"," Yeah."
"9345400","9346800"," I use volume profile every day."
"9347080","9347980"," I use market profile. "
"9348400","9352160"," So I start with, what I do is this is every day is how I start my day."
"9352720","9354940"," I start with traditional charting methods."
"9355540","9359620"," I chart the year, and when I leave that right now, but I, you know, you start chart the year,"
"9360120","9366380"," chart yourself the months, the weeks, and you chart the day, and then you chart yourself setups. "
"9366380","9372620"," So chart yourself bull flags, bear flags, any of these basic setups, right?"
"9373080","9373940"," And there's a bunch of them."
"9374020","9377440"," There's a whole, you can get it, you can get yourself a chart and chart all that stuff out."
"9377940","9381100"," Then you go and you look at the volume in the market profile, you layer that in. "
"9381260","9381960"," That's your second layer."
"9382540","9386360"," You want to see where the risk is and where the potential is for the market to move."
"9386720","9388040"," Up or down, right?"
"9388580","9393100"," Then I move from that and I go into spot gamma and I look at the volatility levels, the gamma"
"9393100","9399820"," levels, and then on the day of day trading, I'm looking at book map, and I'm looking at the options"
"9399820","9400220"," flow. "
"9400380","9402940"," So now I'm looking at the equity dom, the dome, right?"
"9403300","9407640"," Looking at the equity flow, I'm looking at where the buyers and sellers really are in real time."
"9408540","9414120"," And then I'm looking, combining all that information against options flow activity and then"
"9414120","9417320"," resulting in, hey, we should take this long or hey, we should take this short."
"9417800","9419060"," And does it fail?"
"9419380","9422140"," It fails probably 10% of the time. "
"9423240","9428400"," Sometimes 30% if there's some real wackiness going on, but there's usually a way to get out or"
"9428400","9429620"," unfuck yourself at that point."
"9430120","9434460"," But like 90% of the time, you can usually find a trade that's going to print for you."
"9440790","9443650"," Yeah, day trade in the three bar strategy is outstanding. "
"9444230","9445310"," I love the three bar trade."
"9446110","9446330"," Love it."
"9446330","9447710"," And I use those. "
"9447830","9450730"," In my due diligence, I use that information."
"9451110","9451910"," That's an aside."
"9452590","9456070"," Outside of using those different charts, then you've got due diligence. "
"9456770","9458010"," And that's completely separate."
"9458250","9461850"," And that includes classic due diligence like Jason is bringing up."
"9462330","9463390"," Is that Jason that said that?"
"9463810","9465130"," And that's like the three bar plays. "
"9465310","9467330"," You start to look at the things that normal traders do."
"9467670","9470370"," You look at the Elliott wave theory, right?"
"9470490","9474330"," You look at what Elliott wave, because people trade Elliott wave, you have to anticipate that."
"9474330","9479170"," You look at, what's the other one?"
"9480190","9485810"," I'm fucking, sorry, I'm having a problem remembering all these different trading systems. "
"9486310","9487610"," But I'll look up different trading systems."
"9488130","9489290"," I'll look up the market sentiment."
"9489770","9491410"," I'll look up the trader sentiment. "
"9491890","9494250"," I'll look up expected economic news."
"9494570","9495810"," And that's all DD stuff, right?"
"9496910","9498350"," What are the Elliott wave guys expecting?"
"9498770","9502150"," Sometimes there's a support level or resistance level that's not showing on book map."
"9502150","9507010"," And that's due to active trading firms and active traders that use other systems. "
"9512720","9514660"," So you add all that other shit into it, right?"
"9515120","9517100"," Yeah, dude, fib extension levels."
"9517460","9522660"," People trade fib extension levels, even if there isn't, even if support and resistance isn't"
"9522660","9524080"," showing in book map."
"9524680","9528480"," If you don't see like that ice, the stuff that you can't see, these blue and white lines here,"
"9528960","9535000"," these are traders that are using Fibonacci extensions, Fibonacci regression channels. "
"9536140","9541420"," So you'll see other traders that are trading other things and you have to account for that in your"
"9541420","9542240"," trading plan as well."
"9543180","9544420"," And so it's very layered."
"9544620","9546540"," It's like one layer, two layers, three layers. "
"9546980","9549620"," And you're doing all this other shit in the background, this due diligence stuff."
"9550200","9551920"," You're doing all this other stuff about market sentiment."
"9552620","9553800"," You're doing all this stuff with no news. "
"9554460","9557320"," You're doing all this stuff with, you know, it's just never ending, right?"
"9558720","9560700"," ER, ER reports that are coming out."
"9562500","9564580"," Where are we overall in the chart, right?"
"9564940","9567500"," Are we in the accumulation phase on a stock?"
"9567980","9569500"," Are the banks moving a stock right now?"
"9569600","9570340"," Are we trying to catch knives?"
"9571020","9575920"," If like, have all these assumptions going into from the beginning to the end result of where we buy"
"9575920","9576080"," in?"
"9604910","9605930"," All right, I'm going to take a lunch."
"9606630","9609190"," Do you guys want me to leave anything on right now?"
"9609230","9610430"," Do you guys just want the spy on?"
"9610950","9611490"," I'm going to take a lunch. "
"9611630","9612330"," I'm going to leave this running."
"9612450","9613710"," It seems like it's running pretty good."
"9614150","9616370"," I'm going to just, I'm going to mute my voice. "
"9617210","9620730"," I'm going to turn my face off here for a little bit."
"9621030","9624850"," I'm going to go grab a sandwich and I'll be back with you guys later on this afternoon."
"9628590","9629910"," Yeah, you know, Fibs are dumb. "
"9631690","9633470"," Captain made me nine grand today."
"9633810","9634070"," Woo!"
"9640630","9642210"," Hell yes, Joey."
"9644330","9647350"," I'll leave the spy up because it is the market, okay?"
"9648210","9649530"," Realize that it is the market. "
"9650090","9653410"," Realize that we're creating a support level here at 466."
"9657120","9658940"," Vishal is letting you know that the VIX is crashing."
"9661120","9662240"," we'll talk about that. "
"9663120","9668080"," We'll talk about the risk that's involved in tomorrow's market before the end of the day today."
"9668480","9674740"," Chase is bringing up a good point about the CPI numbers, for at least for some localized"
"9674740","9676480"," volatility, maybe a little bit of pullback."
"9677920","9682760"," Why you guys, you know, it's funny, like, it's not that it's not that these, you know, it's funny,"
"9682980","9684200"," like, Elliot wave, I like it. "
"9684200","9692760"," I like it for the, for the general direction, but it's hard to trade Elliot wave, but you use it"
"9692760","9693280"," as a tool."
"9693360","9697560"," It's a one small tool in your box that you know other people are trading."
"9697980","9704200"," So you're looking for those reactions from those traders out there from their hedge funds that just"
"9704200","9708240"," solely rely upon the way of their program software programs that trade Elliot wave. "
"9709220","9711380"," You know, so you have to respect that stuff."
"9712040","9717040"," But when it comes down to the minutiae to find detail, it doesn't really lend itself in fib, fib"
"9717040","9718140"," levels, same thing, right?"
"9718340","9720900"," We can always come back and say, look, we hit that fib level."
"9721680","9727680"," But it's better to use it as a tool than your main source of your trading, your actual, your"
"9727680","9731740"," actual, you know, I'm buying or selling this position right now. "
"9732700","9735060"," Can't just rely upon that one tool in the background."
"9738920","9740260"," That's what I think to do boy."
"9741380","9745620"," They padded the hot CPI number today with the tools and flexibility. "
"9746140","9750400"," So do boy capital is pretty much hitting the nail in the head in my view as well that we're"
"9750400","9752020"," going to get the hot CPI number tomorrow."
"9752860","9757660"," But the key is when they say tools when they say that shit telling you when they say we got"
"9757660","9757940"," tools."
"9758860","9760660"," The fucking faucet still on. "
"9760960","9762620"," I mean, these bastards, no offense."
"9762860","9767020"," I mean, I'm a bull, but I got to tell you these guys, these guys are scamming."
"9767020","9767840"," That's what they're doing. "
"9768020","9768540"," It's a scam."
"9769520","9770160"," It's a scam."
"9770600","9774600"," If they say they got their tools, they're doing that to soften a blow to the market. "
"9775920","9780720"," They know that, you know, you know, you know today if the Fed had come out today and said, the"
"9780720","9781760"," tools are going away, right?"
"9781920","9783420"," We're going to let this market run hot."
"9783860","9786960"," We're going to let this market do its thing without any intervention from the Fed."
"9787480","9789280"," We would be down to Pitsa Hill this morning. "
"9789760","9790260"," Pitsa Hill."
"9790260","9799970"," Oh, Chase, do you want to see the levels,"
"9799970","9800330"," Chase?"
"9800630","9801110"," I can show you."
"9801250","9802070"," I can show you guys. "
"9802430","9812270"," I can show you guys real levels if you ever want to see on"
"9812270","9812650"," Book Map."
"9814170","9816590"," I'll show you right now so you guys can see."
"9817310","9823610"," So you've got a new support or you've got to support at 4.62. You have support at 4.59,"
"9823970","9826370"," let's say, 4.59, right?"
"9826570","9827390"," We can scroll lower though. "
"9828130","9829130"," You guys really want to see low?"
"9830370","9831790"," I'll show you guys some wild numbers."
"9833610","9835270"," 4.55, you've got a level."
"9841340","9849980"," 4.50, 4.59, 4.47. I'll show you guys some wild numbers. "
"9852680","9855680"," You've got kind of a free fall down below 4.47, right?"
"9856460","9858460"," So 4.47 is kind of saw the market."
"9859980","9861900"," I'll go real deep into this if you want."
"9862440","9864380"," 4.39, you've got to support level. "
"9865020","9866760"," You guys can mark these right on your charts."
"9867320","9868980"," You can pause this broadcast, come back to it."
"9869540","9872440"," 4.29, you guys say we can't go this low?"
"9872580","9873920"," I'll show you some banks that think we are. "
"9877850","9881550"," So you see that 4.39 seems like a localized major support."
"9882350","9886150"," You guys have people telling you on YouTube videos you watch where support is deep down in the"
"9886150","9886370"," chart."
"9886830","9888310"," I'll show you where the real support is. "
"9888650","9889570"," Way down here."
"9890430","9896690"," You've got minor support down at 4.33.50. You want to see where Book Map shows?"
"9896950","9897990"," I'll show you where Book Map shows."
"9899570","9905810"," 4.30, 4.26. There's another mark for you to remember. "
"9907990","9910990"," You want to see where the body dippers are, the real deep by the dippers."
"9912710","9914670"," 4.26, you want to see where it's at at 400."
"9915710","9918150"," I can show you all the way down to 4.250 if you want. "
"9918650","9921010"," Some day when we're not in market I'll show you guys these numbers."
"9921650","9927930"," See another mark down here, 4.13.38. The dome is super cool."
"9928430","9929930"," You can see all kinds of cool shit in this. "
"9932070","9935530"," Now everybody's out there talking 4.06. How about 4.08?"
"9936290","9937750"," Has anybody told you about 4.08?"
"9938450","9938910"," 4.10?"
"9940050","9940910"," Pretty cool, huh?"
"9948660","9950400"," Alright, so we're not going to get this crazy anymore."
"9951940","9953580"," Show some bear porn out there."
"9953800","9954940"," You guys want some bear porn?"
"9965880","9966720"," Yeah, I'm not. "
"9967200","9967620"," I don't know."
"9967700","9968760"," I don't think that the."
"9972570","9976170"," I don't think that stop run city makes a good point for what it's worth. "
"9976290","9978550"," The smart money bonds doesn't seem impressed with Powell's parent."
"9978550","9980490"," I agree with that."
"9980630","9986930"," I think what they're saying is what I don't really like Mike Wilson on on MS from Morgan Stanley. "
"9987190","9988990"," But Mike Wilson made a good point yesterday."
"9989090","9990310"," You should all watch that video."
"9990650","9993070"," I don't typically recommend watching CNBC stuff. "
"9993070","9997590"," Mike Wilson's point was we're going to take a pause here in the market."
"9998310","10000490"," This is like I'm saying this sarcastically."
"10001110","10005890"," But you know Mike Wilson saying yesterday we're going to pause the sell off. "
"10006450","10009490"," We're going to take our profit from the ER's."
"10009930","10013330"," And then we'll resume the sell down and don't expect more than another."
"10013690","10016210"," I think he said something stupid like 1%. "
"10017010","10021710"," I think you can expect probably 5% to 10% down move between now and March."
"10022510","10026470"," And then you just tail risk cover which markets in mayhem makes a great point on."
"10026990","10031030"," Which is you cover your ass on those high rate although on those tail risk events. "
"10031510","10036390"," And we trade down to 150 250 350 400."
"10037610","10042850"," And I'll show you guys what we'll make a video or do a live stream outside of regular market hours."
"10042850","10046890"," We'll do we'll get like 150 of you guys or 200 of you guys in here. "
"10047050","10049910"," And I'll show you this trade how to place this trade."
"10050150","10052830"," I'll show you guys how to protect against that."
"10053130","10054450"," That's all the world event. "
"10064620","10065240"," All right."
"10065920","10072420"," So I'll be back after lunch."
"10072980","10074200"," Hope you guys are doing well out there. "
"10086160","10087020"," Let me see."

"10106220","10107160"," I'm going to get some lunch. "
"10107280","10107640"," I'm starving."
"10109660","10111600"," I didn't eat any breakfast this morning."
"10113120","10114140"," I have to feed myself. "
"10114580","10115040"," Nobody loves me."
"10115620","10116780"," I live with a bunch of women."
"10116980","10117500"," They don't love me. "
"10117680","10118820"," They don't take care of me."
"10119600","10120820"," I have to take care of myself."
"10124020","10125440"," Look at that beautiful thing. "
"10125480","10125860"," Look at that."
"10125940","10126220"," Look at that."
"10126380","10126740"," Look at that. "
"10127320","10127460"," Smash."
"10128820","10130080"," Just a huge smash."
"10135540","10138160"," Keep your eyes on the buyer's seller list here. "
"10138540","10142680"," We have lots of calls coming in probably for next week or so Friday or Monday."
"10142680","10148300"," And then you do want to check to see if we get any weakness in here as people take a"
"10148300","10148520"," lunch."
"10150180","10150820"," All right. "
"10152720","10154380"," And I expect this to burn higher."
"10154560","10156520"," I mean, we've got 480 on the table."
"10156520","10157420"," You can see it up here. "
"10157800","10158280"," 479."
"10158980","10160260"," That's the price target right now."
"10160300","10162040"," You can see sellers forming above. "
"10189120","10191060"," I just saw your email there."
"10191220","10192820"," I'm going to check my DMs right now."
"10201710","10203570"," Just one more note out there too. "
"10203890","10206010"," I am looking for some help on the Discord."
"10207070","10211430"," I'm looking for moderators that day trade equities in the cash market."
"10212390","10214210"," Sorry, I'll rephrase that. "
"10214390","10217830"," I'm looking for help with futures, Globex traders."
"10218870","10224910"," They want to lead a Discord channel for a trading room for Globex and futures."
"10225670","10229710"," I'm looking for some moderators on trading options in cash markets on equities. "
"10229710","10231990"," I'm also looking for moderators on crypto."
"10232550","10236950"," I'm looking for a moderator on investing, stock buying and selling."
"10238090","10239970"," And this includes bulls and bears. "
"10240690","10242410"," It doesn't matter which side of the trade you're on."
"10243050","10248890"," But if any of you guys are interested in taking those leadership roles so that those rooms stay"
"10248890","10251510"," kind of clean, there will also be a daily discussion channel."
"10251890","10254850"," So if you're a new trader, it's a place for you to learn how to trade. "
"10254850","10259970"," It's a place for you to openly discuss where to buy, where to sell, those kind of things."
"10260090","10261490"," All these concepts that we talk about here."
"10261970","10263630"," When to take a trade, when not to take a trade. "
"10265030","10266990"," So if any of you guys are interested in that stuff, let me know."
"10267870","10272750"," So we can keep a nice clean trading rooms and then we can have a nice discussion room as to"
"10272750","10277030"," discussing what we talk about, discussing where we are in the market, that kind of stuff."
"10277890","10279170"," I think it's four or five channels. "
"10279370","10280970"," There's a daily discussion thread."
"10280970","10284190"," It's similar to Wall Street, but that's just a main thread that everybody talks in."
"10284770","10289570"," There'll be an actual trading thread for Glovex and Forex markets. "
"10290010","10297370"," There'll be a thread for cash market options traders, a thread for stock investors and sellers,"
"10297870","10300210"," buyers and sellers, and then a thread for crypto."
"10301810","10306730"," And I won't make a, I was going to do a retail favorite stock thread, but I'm not sure if"
"10306730","10307250"," I should yet."
"10307650","10311950"," Maybe that would be like meme stocks, speculative growth stocks, all the other stuff. "
"10312090","10313210"," Maybe we'll do another channel for that."
"10313590","10319630"," Let me know if you guys can DM me on ad captain's alpha about that and we can chat about"
"10319630","10324130"," it and I can have you check out the Discord right now and see what you like and dislike."

"10343100","10347060"," It's mostly want to keep my response was a pretty simple. "
"10347300","10350100"," You want to make sure that people aren't assholes."
"10350940","10356060"," You want people to have some say insanity of respect with each other."
"10356200","10358720"," You know, you kind of, you take your main street hat off the door. "
"10359300","10361340"," You put your trader hat on, right?"
"10361500","10363360"," You put your, you take your main street hat off of the door."
"10363480","10365840"," You put your Wall Street hat on in this sub."
"10367000","10371520"," We can do a not safe for work sub or our channel if people really want something like that. "
"10372040","10377160"," But the ship posting too is fine as long as it's, you know, not nasty or whatever."
"10377940","10379000"," You know, you guys know what I mean."
"10379720","10386620"," But the mod, the real mod, I really want to make sure that the live trading channels are kept"
"10386620","10387400"," clean, right?"
"10387960","10391840"," That there's a direction that everybody wants to go in that we're all trading the same stuff. "
"10393240","10395480"," You guys all out there should know that."
"10396720","10399220"," Some of the best traders, they keep it simple."
"10399560","10400220"," They trade the spy. "
"10400800","10401660"," They trade the VIX."
"10402040","10403420"," They are a spider product."
"10403680","10404160"," They'll trade ES. "
"10404780","10405800"," They'll trade SPX."
"10406740","10407840"," That's how they make their money."
"10408560","10411300"," And then you go off and learn individual tickers. "
"10411520","10412000"," It could be anything."
"10412300","10412740"," It could be Apple."
"10413000","10413460"," It could be Tesla. "
"10414220","10414800"," You pick it, right?"
"10415080","10417220"," If it's BA, Disney, whatever it is."
"10418420","10421900"," And then you branch off into speculative growth stocks."
"10422140","10425040"," You branch off into meme stocks, that kind of stuff. "
"10425040","10432160"," So you start with a base on a very liquid stock that's out there or derivative, or excuse me, very"
"10432160","10435440"," liquid product like a spider index."
"10435680","10440280"," And then you branch off into IWM, the queues, individual tickers, that kind of stuff."
"10440560","10442160"," You kind of want to build the stuff around that. "
"10442860","10446580"," And the mods just kind of need to keep it clean, make sure that the real traders are getting their"
"10446580","10447540"," space to trade."
"10448820","10452700"," That traders that are learning from these guys can go in there and trade with them once they feel"
"10452700","10452980"," confident."
"10452980","10458860"," And that new traders have a safe space to discuss trading and a daily thread and stuff like that. "
"10461830","10467890"," You don't need someone in there trading day in day out, but I know that there are people that like"
"10467890","10468750"," to trade in Discord."
"10469250","10471630"," So I want them to have a space to trade in that Discord."
"10472370","10475810"," I've traded in Discord trading rooms and the good ones. "
"10476550","10480730"," Usually there's a space available for those traders to just trade."
"10480730","10485450"," And then there's a space available for a new trader to be like, hey, I'm thinking about buying the"
"10485450","10487770"," spy here, but should I or shouldn't die?"
"10488070","10491130"," And that's really regulated to a different trading channel."
"10491490","10494490"," You want like a daily discussion thread for that kind of talk. "
"10495150","10496370"," You see I have like active traders."
"10496870","10498190"," Maybe I should maybe I'm not wearing this right."
"10498670","10501370"," You have like active trading channels that are actively trading. "
"10501850","10507970"," And then you have another channel where you're bouncing the idea, hey, should I buy this spy bottom"
"10507970","10510690"," or this es bottom or whatever, right?"
"10515790","10517850"," I'm not I don't think I'm using the right words for this."
"10523060","10527220"," I'll bring this closer down on a better time frame for any guys they're looking for."
"10530660","10532720"," What's happening underneath the surface here?"
"10532740","10534520"," I'll bring this a little bit lower for you guys. "
"10535800","10537200"," That's your VWAP right here."
"10538360","10539000"," And I'll be back."
"10540300","14449980"," Hey, everybody. "
"14450100","14451500"," Any guys out there still listening right now?"
"14451740","14452200"," I'm still here."
"14453860","14458560"," So I want to talk to you guys about where we are at this moment right now in the market."
"14459500","14461720"," A little bit of consolidation that was going on. "
"14462240","14468660"," We saw that little relief valve back at 11.45 and you've got one, two bounces here."
"14469280","14470240"," This is a day trader's paradise."
"14470440","14473240"," This is that three bar problem that people are talking about. "
"14473240","14477300"," I'm on a five minute chart right now, but I'm assuming that if you look on a 15 minute chart,"
"14477620","14481820"," you got one, two and three just about to happen here."
"14482440","14483840"," It's kind of like a do or die moments."
"14483980","14488640"," And if you actually look on a one minute chart as one bounce back at 11.49. There's another bounce"
"14488640","14494120"," right now at 12.29. You have another bounce right here at 1307 at 107 this afternoon. "
"14494680","14498200"," It's kind of like a do or die moments here for the spy."
"14498840","14500100"," It's 118 in the afternoon."
"14500100","14503540"," I think we're going to rip up now into that 469.05 area. "
"14504060","14509540"," There are a bunch of people in on calls at 97 cents, 98 cents on calls."
"14510800","14513540"," Everyone switched from the put side to the call side."
"14513780","14514860"," So where do we go?"
"14515120","14520480"," Now there are $1.05. Now there are $1.06. And we are heading up. "
"14520620","14522060"," That's 10% right away, right?"
"14522180","14523060"," Almost 10%."
"14524300","14526380"," And we're going to start ripping up."
"14526380","14532640"," If we were to tag, let's say, my price target here is somewhere around 469. "
"14533600","14540300"," So if we tag up to 469, that should be a 50% profit on some FDs."
"14540860","14543860"," Well, we can't call FDs expire on January 12."
"14544780","14548220"," So you're going to look for a tag to 140 or so, maybe even 130. "
"14552130","14553270"," So just give it a second here."
"14553350","14553850"," We're going to see it."
"14553910","14556590"," We're bouncing right now on some key support. "
"14557370","14559090"," We have more buyers and sellers."
"14559590","14561130"," Here are indicators off the chart."
"14561670","14566310"," If you wanted to take a quick, fast trade, we've got an hour before we start to sell down once"
"14566310","14567710"," more for a rip into clothes. "
"14568010","14569570"," That would be the expectation at this point."
"14569990","14572710"," The reason that I'm bringing that up to you is this, okay?"
"14573170","14578030"," Is that when we opened up this morning, we knew we had a do or die situation."
"14578830","14583730"," We had a moment where we knew we would trade up or we knew that we would trade down. "
"14583730","14590490"," We knew that if the wrong information came out, that our viewpoint is bearish."
"14591350","14596630"," So I want you to realize that even if we trade back slightly, that the viewpoint is that we are"
"14596630","14599210"," long at this moment, okay, at this juncture."
"14600030","14605650"," Every time we create a support level, we might trade back, but we are still heading higher. "
"14606610","14610990"," And we've spent the last two hours consolidating."
"14610990","14614010"," We spent the last two hours with buyers absorbing sellers."
"14614610","14616370"," We spent the last two hours buying calls. "
"14617070","14619070"," And you're going to see a rip higher at this point."
"14619570","14621470"," Now that 470, we might not hit."
"14621710","14623190"," We may hit 470 today. "
"14623510","14625690"," I don't think we hit 470 until the bell."
"14626750","14633330"," But right now in this intraday moment, I would expect us to trade up higher and try to tag that"
"14633330","14635650"," 469, then maybe trade back."
"14635890","14638070"," And you see that we're ripping higher right now at this moment. "
"14638070","14641290"," There's a little bit of a delay here in my broadcast."
"14642170","14645310"," But I'm coming on to you live right now because we are at a critical juncture."
"14646530","14652250"," And those calls that were 97 cents just a moment ago, they're now up to $1.12. So we've slammed"
"14652250","14653270"," past 10%. "
"14653270","14655890"," It's a quick two minute play for a fast 10%."
"14655890","14658350"," You can't make that in a year on a bank, right?"
"14658510","14660490"," You make like 5% maybe in an entire year."
"14661290","14662730"," We're tagging 468, 27. "
"14663710","14666090"," And my price target is 469, 05."
"14666690","14668770"," That is the beginning of real volatility."
"14670010","14674730"," So expect to see a bounce or a ricochet or even though it isn't showing it on book map right"
"14674730","14679590"," now, you're going to expect some kind of volatility there. "
"14679770","14681410"," You're going to expect retail traders."
"14681830","14683110"," You're going to expect small offices."
"14683710","14685210"," You're going to actually see it forming right now. "
"14685390","14689570"," If you guys are looking at me live on YouTube, you'll see it's sneaky."
"14690090","14694190"," You'll see right here a little bit of sellers down below at 46987."
"14694870","14697330"," You see this above here, 470. "
"14698070","14700890"," This will be localized resistance as we trade higher."
"14701770","14705470"," So you can take that trade probably to 469 safely."
"14705910","14708110"," And then you'll look for a little bit more of a rejection. "
"14709090","14712690"," You'll see more sellers above at 47290."
"14713410","14715550"," So you'll see some trouble above here."
"14715990","14719750"," But once we break above this zone, you're going to see that Vanna rally continue on. "
"14720330","14721570"," And think back to that."
"14721570","14723670"," I want you to think back to this morning."
"14724070","14727530"," We're opening that we're looking for a nod from the Fed. "
"14727890","14730310"," Are we going higher or we're going lower?"
"14730750","14733070"," I don't want you to think about, hey, are we going to go to 500?"
"14733370","14733750"," Because we're not."
"14733850","14734530"," We all know we're not."
"14735230","14739910"," But a bull will take a chance here at this moment and think about us trading higher. "
"14741410","14742290"," That's their plan."
"14742470","14743630"," The bulls are loading up."
"14743930","14751010"," They think they can take this to probably 475, I would say 480 is the far out call wall. "
"14751010","14755010"," And then let's say that's the ultimate game."
"14755150","14755490"," That's that fair."
"14755550","14755790"," It's called. "
"14755930","14756970"," It's like an ultimate gamut strike."
"14757390","14762430"," Probably 478 would be like an Adam Men's senior on Twitter is going to tell you we're going to 478."
"14762890","14764230"," So we might get there. "
"14764710","14766870"," But 475 is a reasonable strike."
"14767350","14771310"," So maybe you look at 475 for two weeks out or a week out."
"14772190","14775730"," You know that we're going to have some weakness heading into next Thursday. "
"14775890","14777790"," I think the next is not next Thursday."
"14778370","14783710"," You'll see some weakness by the opening of the 20th."
"14784010","14787250"," So we probably have three to four days to get to 475. "
"14788030","14790590"," And we sell down into the 20th on Thursday."
"14791310","14793170"," And then we have our face ripper on Thursday."
"14793250","14795290"," At the end of the day, we trade sideways into Friday. "
"14795810","14797490"," That would be the expectation at this point."
"14797910","14799370"," Unless you have some news out there."
"14800330","14804570"," That's all I can tell you is that you're looking to tag like 469 by close. "
"14805170","14806950"," Possibly 470 by close."
"14807370","14810890"," Or we even trade sideways and we just gap up into tomorrow."
"14811530","14812770"," Would not shock me at all. "
"14813090","14818970"," So if you're getting eaten up by holding calls right now, let's say you bought calls right at 466"
"14818970","14820130"," around 12 o'clock."
"14820510","14822010"," And they're losing value slightly."
"14822850","14824230"," I would hold on to those calls. "
"14824450","14825110"," Hold on to the grip."
"14825630","14828090"," You can you can even average into these calls."
"14829590","14831570"," You can let's say you've got a thousand dollars. "
"14831570","14834110"," We'll use a thousand bucks as an as an average."
"14834750","14839490"," And let's say you buy your initial buy in here waiting for this rip is that you spend 30%"
"14839490","14840730"," on that on that rip, right?"
"14841230","14845890"," You average down another another hundred bucks two, three, four times."
"14846370","14848630"," You save the last bit of your gunpowder. "
"14848950","14853670"," Your last bit of 500 bucks for moments like to write right now."
"14854170","14855490"," Into the three o'clock hour."
"14855810","14859830"," Or you save that last bit of gunpowder for the three o'clock hour. "
"14859830","14863530"," Because you'll probably find one more dip happening later on this afternoon."
"14864270","14867350"," You have to like layer this stuff right for your risk tolerance."
"14868550","14871750"," That we trade up into the 470 by close. "
"14872210","14876950"," You guys can assume at this point, you can assume that we trade up to at least 469."
"14877450","14879110"," If not 470 by the bell."
"14879630","14880870"," Garin fucking teed. "
"14881150","14883510"," That doesn't mean we don't trade that at some point at three o'clock."
"14883690","14886550"," Doesn't mean that we don't have that brief moment at 315."
"14886550","14890990"," We have that one quick dip so the banks can get in to maximize profits. "
"14891550","14893730"," But you can expect that at this point."
"14894310","14900850"," You are seeing some sellers right now that just stepped in right here at 469.73. That's where the"
"14900850","14901910"," anticipation is."
"14902170","14905550"," There's some more heavy sellers at 472.76 above. "
"14906350","14907170"," You can write that one in."
"14907430","14910370"," You know that this volatility zone right here is going to be tough to get through."
"14910770","14912350"," You want to know how we get through this zone above. "
"14913110","14915530"," You want to know how we get through 469?"
"14916530","14918150"," You want to know how we get through this area?"
"14918430","14918830"," I'll tell you."
"14919030","14921210"," It's the same way that we traded down on Monday."
"14922050","14928730"," You take it up to this level into the Tuesday close and you let the futures crowd do it for"
"14928730","14928970"," you. "
"14930030","14933390"," They'll break past the sellers that are hiding above here."
"14933950","14935270"," This volatility zone."
"14935730","14937870"," What they'll do is they'll take it over for you tomorrow. "
"14940070","14946830"," We just slammed into 468.38. We'll look at it more even more closely here and see what you can"
"14946830","14947130"," see."
"14948130","14950630"," We have major buyers stepping in."
"14950910","14952190"," 270,000. "
"14952830","14957350"," No, 2.7 million to 2.465 million."
"14957710","14961210"," Here are indicators off the F in charts, right?"
"14962130","14964910"," You can see we have some volatility right where we are right now."
"14965270","14966430"," Let's look at the reality of it. "
"14966430","14967330"," We know."
"14967810","14970570"," We know that we can get to 469 by the bell."
"14970870","14974570"," We know that we can probably get to 469, 1963 by the bell. "
"14974970","14977050"," We know what the real sellers are here, right?"
"14977970","14979710"," As a matter of fact, you just saw them disappear."
"14980330","14981370"," They just disappeared live."
"14982310","14983190"," You've got this brief. "
"14983550","14984870"," Let me take a look at this."
"14988790","14989710"," 468, 30."
"14990990","14991850"," What do you call this?"
"14992090","14992910"," Costors last stand. "
"14993630","14994590"," 468, 32."
"14995470","14996630"," You see some sellers here?"
"14997650","14998450"," 468, 32."
"14998690","14999450"," They're like, nope, nope. "
"14999570","15001010"," You're not going to trade this up to 470."
"15001790","15002910"," Well, I promise you."
"15003130","15003730"," I promise. "
"15004210","15009910"," I'm going to give you like a 60% chance to 80% chance that between now and the bell,"
"15010430","15014810"," you're going to see us trade up, rip up into that close, and then you're going to see futures,"
"15015410","15017090"," throw it above for the look above."
"15017250","15018090"," And why do we do that?"
"15018930","15021550"," Well, we didn't trade down today at the open, did we?"
"15021850","15024170"," At 10 a.m., we didn't trade down, did we?"
"15024170","15029690"," So you know that the market wants to have a look above volatility."
"15030350","15033770"," They want to have a look above and see if the market wants to take it higher. "
"15034270","15036110"," And they're going to make that look above."
"15036270","15037730"," They're going to do that look above in cash market."
"15038170","15041690"," And if cash market can't do it, they're going to do it in the after hours, in the overnight. "
"15042390","15042990"," They'll put it above."
"15043470","15046610"," They'll place it there for the Wednesday open."
"15046910","15050990"," So you get there Wednesday open and now you're above it for 70, and they're going to say, okay,"
"15051330","15057090"," let's see if the banks want to buy more calls and expand the gamma, positive gamma, higher to 470"
"15057090","15061390"," or 480, excuse me, from 470 to 478 or 480, even higher to 500. "
"15062450","15063350"," That's what they're going to do."
"15063890","15068450"," And if no one buys calls tomorrow, then we know we have to go lower, right?"
"15068850","15072270"," That there's always like, we're looking below to see if we need to go lower."
"15072570","15074590"," We're looking above to see if we need to go higher. "
"15075250","15078750"," We know this morning that we did not go below."
"15078750","15083430"," We know that we were looking for an event, a known event, J-POW."
"15083970","15086490"," Are you telling us that the money flow is off or not?"
"15086810","15087570"," And he said no. "
"15087970","15088990"," Do I think that that's temporary?"
"15090110","15092130"," But the market doesn't give a fly enough about that."
"15092990","15094470"," Market wants to know a direction."
"15095110","15096690"," Market wants to figure out a direction. "
"15097410","15104410"," And the market knows that until we go above 470 or 472, that it has to take us there at"
"15104410","15104870"," some point."
"15104870","15108130"," Whether we want to go there or not, they're going to look above."
"15109950","15112710"," You guys understand or agree with all this or disagree with all this?"
"15115930","15116310"," No. "
"15117070","15120680"," And we just made a beautiful move."
"15122640","15126360"," Above here, you're probably going to see, I'm watching right now, ready?"
"15128080","15130080"," This just all came in at one o'clock, 108."
"15132360","15136580"," QQQ, 386 calls, couple racks, $127,000. "
"15136580","15141980"," SQ, January 21st, $171,000."
"15142500","15145580"," FXI, 185 grand on a $39 call."
"15146000","15155280"," INTC at 60 bucks, $800,000 on INTC trading to $60 on January"
"15155280","15156580"," 19th. "
"15156580","15159000"," RWM, 217, 66 grand."
"15159460","15161320"," SPY, $72,000."
"15162100","15165040"," January 21st, PTON, February 25th, 50 C."
"15165640","15170620"," QQQ, 386 on January 12th, SPY, January 12th. "
"15171100","15174040"," You know, when you start to see this stuff, January 12th, 468 C."
"15174980","15178480"," QQQ, 385 C for another $123,000."
"15179060","15183660"," SPY, January 12th, 470 C for $57,000."
"15183660","15188020"," The key when you're looking at this stuff is, I want you guys to understand that. "
"15188540","15189620"," We looked below."
"15190300","15195780"," If we were trading down below today at 10 a.m., right, I would tell you the inverse, I would"
"15195780","15197480"," say, start buying some puts."
"15197920","15199300"," We're going to explore lower levels. "
"15199480","15200900"," We're going to see if that's where we're headed."
"15201800","15205840"," Right now, the way things are in the market, we're going to start exploring higher levels."
"15206240","15208700"," So when you see a dip, you should start buying that dip. "
"15209620","15214680"," I want you guys to see, remember earlier, we had this cell wall that was here."
"15215080","15216500"," It's been wrecked at this point."
"15217380","15222420"," If you guys are afraid of taking FDs, you can make those calls for a week out, two weeks out,"
"15222940","15224640"," and just make 10 or 20%. "
"15224640","15224820"," Right?"
"15225600","15228260"," You see a little bit of this cell wall just came in at 473."
"15228840","15229820"," That makes sense, right?"
"15230620","15234220"," We're going to break through all this ice above here and start looking above."
"15235000","15237140"," You can see it forming up at 478. "
"15237140","15237860"," Here we go."
"15238320","15239300"," This is new, right?"
"15239500","15240500"," This just started."
"15241600","15242480"," That's 472. "
"15243120","15244700"," This is like a bear's last stand."
"15244840","15246360"," They're going to stay there and they're going to stay to you."
"15246760","15247800"," Okay, fuck it. "
"15248440","15250640"," 472, you're breaking just above volatility."
"15251280","15253100"," I'm going to be waiting to knock you down."
"15253460","15255100"," You've got more call buyers stepping. "
"15255300","15256520"," Remember how light blew this was?"
"15256860","15262440"," We didn't even have an 8480 call level the earlier this week when we were selling off."
"15262620","15263460"," That just disappeared."
"15264120","15265940"," You're starting to see it reform again. "
"15265940","15268200"," It's showing you where the call wall is."
"15268300","15268840"," It's at 480."
"15269780","15271360"," You guys can even just enter spreads. "
"15271800","15273860"," You guys don't want to lose your money if you're like shit."
"15274240","15275320"," I don't know how to time off at an FD."
"15275980","15277680"," We talked about this yesterday, right?"
"15278160","15280960"," Buy yourself some call spreads that are in the money that are safe. "
"15281460","15283920"," You can have a viewpoint on when to expire."
"15284220","15287200"," You could expire on Monday because everybody's in calls for Friday."
"15287720","15290080"," You could do it one more day so it actually goes there. "
"15290480","15291740"," You could even put that call."
"15291880","15295040"," You could even put that call spread at 468 right now."
"15295040","15299940"," Have them expire on OPEC's day right on that Friday of OPEC's. "
"15300220","15305880"," If we're going to trade down below 468 or 465 on OPEC's, I think you're smoking crack."
"15306340","15307440"," I really do."
"15307860","15312760"," Maybe we trade down there on the Thursday of OPEC's, but I doubt on the Friday that we're still"
"15312760","15316340"," there or I doubt that the end of the day on Thursday that we're still at 465. "
"15316960","15318240"," Maybe you only make 10%."
"15318240","15321760"," That's 10% more than you would have made trading FD's if you don't out of time."
"15324740","15328970"," So that's all I want you guys to know out there. "
"15329190","15331310"," I want you guys to see where we are actually out in the market."
"15331430","15334590"," I want you guys to think about if there is a dip, how you roll."
"15334870","15338230"," When I tell you guys, when do you stop your trade?"
"15338950","15340010"," When do you add to your trade?"
"15340230","15341290"," When do you roll your trade?"
"15341870","15345670"," The perspective on the market right now until we hear something different is bullish. "
"15346250","15347330"," Is it bullish though to 500?"
"15348210","15348550"," Fuck no."
"15349170","15351310"," But it is bullish for a day trader."
"15351830","15355210"," It's bullish for a swing trader to say, hey, we're probably going to go up. "
"15355210","15357430"," It's up to 470, possibly 475."
"15358350","15360570"," There's no way we're going to 478 and 480."
"15361210","15365570"," But I'm going to at least enter into some calls that are short dated into Friday for that to"
"15365570","15365890"," happen. "
"15366970","15369610"," Now you do have smart money below at 462."
"15370870","15375570"," If you have a risk-inversive kind of person and you're like, hey, I really want to, I missed the"
"15375570","15376350"," ride."
"15376990","15379510"," And I really want to enter some long calls when I can't at this point. "
"15380150","15380230"," Sure."
"15380730","15386090"," V-Wops down here at 460 or 4, 465, 25."
"15387030","15393510"," Then you've got, you've got real money down below waiting for a dip at 462, I believe. "
"15394290","15395870"," Let's take a look at that and see where it's at."
"15397990","15399330"," Right here, 462."
"15400250","15401630"," So you can wait for that as well. "
"15401930","15407190"," But to think at any point while we're trading today live would be to think that we're not going to"
"15407190","15410170"," 469 or 470 today is just pure and say no."
"15410170","15414770"," I had to have a bearish output right now, outlook right now, at least for the rest of the week"
"15414770","15415590"," is in Sano."
"15416490","15417830"," You're going against the grain. "
"15418510","15421450"," You know that last week on Thursday I was very ultra bearish, right?"
"15421550","15424110"," I'm telling you, we're trading down, we're definitely trading down."
"15424310","15426070"," I said, oh, Friday's going to be the day."
"15426630","15427310"," It ended up being Monday. "
"15428130","15429470"," But we knew that we're selling the market."
"15429630","15430730"," We knew that we're in a bearish context."
"15431470","15433810"," Right now we're not in that bearish context, okay?"
"15434970","15439690"," So structure your trades appropriately, enter into some trades, and know that before the end of the"
"15439690","15441390"," day, that that's going to get pumped up. "
"15442190","15447870"," You're at 273 buyers versus 250 on the seller's sell side."
"15448130","15450310"," You've got people just loading the tits on calls."
"15450810","15452690"," They're probably dated just for Friday. "
"15453150","15454050"," But that doesn't matter."
"15454410","15456250"," You only have to run it up from now into the close."
"15456790","15461510"," You only have to worry about if you're in a call spread, you know, what are you waiting for?"
"15462330","15464250"," By call spread that it expires tomorrow. "
"15464770","15466270"," So I think that we sell down tomorrow."
"15466270","15467950"," We ricochet off for 70 tomorrow."
"15468370","15469170"," I doubt it. "
"15469290","15473870"," I think that they try to push it up into at least a base of 470."
"15474550","15478490"," They're going to give the look above to see if the bulls really want to take this north."
"15478830","15482510"," If they don't want to take this north and we start trade sideways down, we will. "
"15482870","15484290"," Well, let's say we break through 470."
"15485010","15486090"," We don't quite get to 475."
"15486990","15491930"," And then we just start trading sideways all the way into the Thursday before OPEC's. "
"15492010","15493250"," We trade down that day."
"15493250","15497650"," And then all of a sudden it's a ripper to bring us back into where the spreads are for the"
"15497650","15498690"," big banks."
"15500710","15503530"," But if you guys want to capture us in the middle of the day, take it long. "
"15507600","15508100"," That's all I got."
"15508200","15509220"," I'm going to get off here for a minute."
"15968860","15972020"," So I want you guys to just be aware, right?"
"15972240","15974080"," You have a bunch of ice in here. "
"15974560","15975720"," This is to be expected, right?"
"15976440","15982520"," You've got a little bit of resistance here at 469.72. So I'd be conscious of that."
"15983140","15987700"," And then I'm going to look for the overnight to push us above this."
"15988540","15989960"," I'm going to get you guys a target, okay?"
"15990420","15992580"," Unless this changes between the end of today and tomorrow. "
"15993220","15995080"," I would look for an open tomorrow at 473."
"15995380","15995820"," This could move."
"15996000","15997320"," This could move down, move higher. "
"15997940","15998520"," I think about where we lay."
"15998680","16002780"," If we end up trading back down to 462, maybe we trade higher above later on."
"16002780","16004000"," Or if we hit the VWOP or something. "
"16004440","16005280"," There's a lot of unknowns there."
"16005720","16011500"," But let's say if we close today at this moment, I would expect to gap up to 473.32. And"
"16011500","16013380"," this will play out as we get closer to the close today."
"16014580","16020620"," But I'm going to expect 469.03, maybe even 470, into the close. "
"16021100","16025060"," And then I would expect, believe it or not, a look above for the open tomorrow."
"16172410","16174350"," I'm going to chime in right here."
"16175170","16176950"," You see the thickness of that support. "
"16178130","16184450"," A little bit of ice above at 468.74. You see though here that the resistance is weakening."
"16185230","16187530"," You see how thick the, here we go."
"16188490","16189630"," Here we go. "
"16190350","16191210"," Here we go."
"16191670","16394020"," I think I"
"16394020","16395220"," missed the pen by one penny."
"16406439","16408200"," We'll look closer again, okay. "
"16417520","16419320"," It was right up here as where it reached."
"16421300","16422060"," Right here."
"16422200","16423939"," A little tiny resistance. "
"16428259","16439830"," But we're going to look at even above and see where some 469.76. Yeah,"
"16439910","16440470"," it's somewhere up here."
"16440550","16441410"," We got some clear skies above."
"16443570","16447090"," And we guys know the weird shit that happens in the market, right?"
"16447270","16450270"," You end up seeing that last little push. "
"16451349","16452210"," I'm going to two o'clock."
"16452490","16453330"," Remember, it's 151."
"16453689","16454610"," We've only got nine minutes left. "
"16455490","16457270"," So you got this one little bit right here."
"16457669","16458990"," Maybe you take your weddings right now."
"16459070","16459529"," You get out. "
"16460090","16462150"," You wait for that two o'clock hour that we trade down."
"16462349","16464790"," Sometimes we trade high at two o'clock to three o'clock."
"16464890","16465890"," Sometimes I do move it. "
"16465890","16467849"," There is that slight possibility."
"16468470","16472270"," But then you're looking for that, like, we're all going to get together 3 p.m. We're going to wait"
"16472270","16474290"," for that sexy little double dip or triple dip."
"16474710","16477529"," And then you ride that shit home to mama, right?"
"16479410","16481210"," So it's all the risk that you want to put on. "
"16482110","16483509"," Buy yourself some in the money calls."
"16484169","16485529"," Buy yourself some in the money."
"16485890","16486770"," Calls expire Friday. "
"16487410","16488369"," Buy yourself some."
"16488689","16489550"," You can add to them later."
"16490130","16491070"," Buy yourself some spreads. "
"16491910","16492810"," Whatever you need to do."
"16492869","16497410"," If you want to wait until like 3.15 or 3.05 or if you want to wait two o "
"16497410","16497590","'clock."
"16497770","16499570"," It's all depends on your risk. "
"16500130","16503029"," If you think we're going to trade back a little bit, I think that's possible."
"16503450","16507730"," Easily possible between now and 3 p.m. And then you grab the spreads, right?"
"16508189","16513009"," One of my favorite things to do is to grab spreads right before the bell or at the three o "
"16513009","16513590","'clock hour."
"16514790","16521470"," And because there's that moment there where they're cheap and they print heavily into the next day,"
"16521470","16521750"," right?"
"16522310","16523529"," Buy some Friday spreads. "
"16524110","16526029"," Don't have to deal with any of that burning of options."
"16528400","16532180"," The next question you guys have to ask yourself is where is OPEC's on Friday?"
"16532840","16534680"," Where do the banks think we're going to be on Friday?"
"16536680","16537119"," Right?"
"16537220","16538119"," We've traded down."
"16539400","16540880"," So we went high to 480. "
"16541860","16549840"," We traded down to 1.457. And if you look at a larger chart for like three months out, we're"
"16549840","16557400"," probably going to wind up back at 465, 470 at some point by Friday."
"16558380","16559820"," And so we swung down."
"16560000","16565300"," Maybe we swing higher and we swing right back down on this 4.6. I bet you by the time"
"16565300","16569200"," we get to OPEC's that would be easy to have it in the money spread. "
"16570360","16572919"," That it'll come right back into this zone right where we are."
"16573500","16575599"," Like not too far off from where we are."
"16576040","16579240"," You'll probably see us wind up on OPEC's this month. "
"16581060","16585320"," Unless you think we're going lower, it's possible that we wind up at 460 at OPEC's."
"16585939","16586939"," It's definitely possible."
"16587840","16589200"," I can't say that it's not possible. "
"16589960","16592460"," We end up at 460, but we all take risks, right?"
"16592700","16593320"," That's the thing."
"16594020","16597960"," You got to see what your view point is on where we wind up at OPEC's."
"16598020","16598680"," OPEC's is important. "
"16602000","16602880"," It's matters."
"16603380","16606080"," They have a lot riding on where we are at OPEC's."
"16606380","16608540"," And I bet there's some people out there that think. "
"16609349","16614740"," I would think that the at the implied OPEC's close is probably 468."
"16618000","16619820"," Maybe it's at 456, but."
"16621820","16624240"," January's 10, 10, 10 to be a positive month. "
"16625020","16627279"," You have banks accumulating for the year."
"16629259","16632939"," If I had to take a gander at a shotgun gander, shotgun gander."
"16633560","16637419"," I would say that 465 is the lowest we will be. "
"16639060","16640980"," At OPEC's in the highest is 475."
"16641880","16643640"," So right here below 470."
"16644740","16646060"," Not unreasonable to see. "
"16646580","16648779"," At least on the Thursday of OPEC's."
"16649480","16651740"," I would give that a 80% chance."
"16651919","16654000"," We'll see that the Thursday of OPEC's. "
"16654779","16656259"," Unless there's something we don't know."
"16666939","16667919"," What is with the drop?"
"16668140","16668740"," These are day traders."
"16669200","16671240"," Day traders are trading the spy right now. "
"16671240","16674540"," It's the most liquid ETF stock."
"16674740","16678020"," It's not a stock, but you know, if you had a stock and ETF, you had a spider."
"16679020","16684259"," It's people placing trades the last 15 minutes, 5 minutes, 10 minutes, an hour. "
"16684779","16685460"," 45 minute."
"16685460","16686200"," Well, I shouldn't say an hour."
"16686759","16690779"," Most traders trade about 15 minute time frames, 45 minute times for frames. "
"16691360","16695320"," Depends if you're trading a one minute chart or a 15 minute chart or a."
"16695800","16698700"," That's the three by right or three top stuff."
"16698700","16701259"," If you're trading a one minute chart right now on spy."
"16702259","16704439"," If you put the spy on a one minute chart. "
"16706619","16708560"," Just for yourself to look and see, right?"
"16709840","16713380"," You've got one test at 1149."
"16714160","16716220"," You have a second test at 1228."
"16717080","16721340"," You have a third test at 1307 at 107 and the afternoon. "
"16722200","16724700"," No break below it at 107 in the afternoon."
"16725020","16726140"," Do you know what that tells a day trader?"
"16726680","16728580"," Take that long and ride it up."
"16729119","16737279"," They wrote it up from 467.01 to 468.57. That's 150% rip right there. "
"16738400","16743160"," And now you're hoping or you're not hoping, but you're talking to yourself saying, well, where do"
"16743160","16743480"," we go?"
"16743740","16743800"," Right?"
"16744460","16747599"," We're probably going to go to 470 at the close or close to it."
"16747680","16748119"," 469."
"16748680","16751520"," I want to get a better positioning. "
"16752400","16755759"," So as a day trader, you're thinking to yourself two things."
"16756360","16760020"," If I put some risk on just in case we just trade straight there in the close."
"16760840","16769599"," Or do I may risk aversive and hope to hope that we can trade down to 467.65. Real greed"
"16769599","16777000"," would be at 466.92. And if you're really, if you're, let me look at a better chart here. "
"16778460","16786580"," If you're really begging and hoping for a steel trade, if you're a, yeah, you might, we might trade"
"16786580","16790320"," down right into the bell and then we'll rip higher into tomorrow."
"16791400","16792560"," That's possible too."
"16793880","16800100"," But if you really wanted a really cheap deal, it's probably at 465.90. If you're a day trader"
"16800100","16804600"," trading just straight charts, you're hoping that we trade down from here. "
"16805640","16810160"," But you can miss this easily because the entire market right now knows we're heading higher."
"16810740","16812260"," And that's the problem in these situations."
"16813280","16816100"," Like you trade really well when no one's expecting something. "
"16816560","16819160"," If you become a good trader like that, you can catch those moves."
"16819860","16824040"," But if the entire market then knows that you're trading higher over time, they just start piling"
"16824040","16824420"," in."
"16825440","16827280"," You know, they're just loading the fuck up. "
"16827340","16827960"," It doesn't matter."
"16828680","16830520"," You just got to grab any kind of dip you can get."
"16833710","16841610"," I'll post this right now on Twitter so you can see where the by the dip zones are heading into"
"16841610","16842030"," the close. "
"16842750","16845690"," That you hope that the entire market doesn't already know."
"16846310","16849970"," Because I'll tell you right now, even the dumbest traders out that have any time in this market"
"16849970","16850950"," know we're heading higher."
"16851310","16851770"," They all do. "
"16852290","16855950"," Any kind of consolidation is leading to us ripping to 469."
"16857010","16861370"," Anybody knows that futures is going to try to put us over to see if we're trading higher."
"16861810","16865290"," You can actually see us ripping at this moment in this podcast. "
"16866110","16867630"," So you might not get that opportunity."
"16868110","16872410"," I'll tell you where you could possibly catch a cheaper trade."
"16873310","16875550"," But I doubt it because of where we are. "
"16876310","16878250"," Markets telling you we're going up to look to see."
"16879250","16881550"," And I don't believe we're going to 500 right now."
"16881990","16884550"," But you know that the market thinks we can go higher. "
"16886910","16888810"," And you know that the money spigot's still on."
"16888970","16891350"," If I was a bear right now, I'd be pretty fucking pissed off."
"16892790","16896230"," Because I post the chart right now for some levels for you to grab. "
"16896550","16902270"," If we trade down, it's got the dotted line on it, the yellow line, the dotted line, the white line."
"16902450","16903430"," Just posted it on Twitter."
"16904190","16907050"," If you want to get a chance of buying a dip, it's down below. "
"16907730","16911410"," The red lines that are above is where I expect us to trade to into the bell."
"16911410","16915970"," If we trade, if there's a buy program on the bell, we'll trade higher."
"16916350","16926330"," We'll end up trading to 4.7092. I'll show you this one here too"
"16926330","16927210"," so you guys have it. "
"16930260","16932760"," I'm going to share this one with you as well."
"16933740","16936400"," It shows slightly higher than the spy chart at least."
"16940640","16943200"," And with the point being is that spreads are great here. "
"16944500","16945660"," Low risk environment."
"16948360","16950640"," That shows you slightly higher we need to break above."
"16951760","16955620"," These numbers have been changing so fast that they're not exactly accurate. "
"16955620","16960180"," But it gives you a visualization of what you're looking for to make this rip higher."
"16964660","16969060"," So you guys can kind of visualize the book map versus the candlestick chart."
"16970040","16972000"," And those are the pieces that you put together. "
"16972620","16978880"," You put the candlestick chart against the volume and market profile."
"16979520","16983180"," And you put the book map against all of this stuff."
"16983680","16985560"," And you can start to see where we're headed. "
"16987100","16987920"," So there you go."
"16988500","16989620"," I'm going to get back off the mic again."
"17071620","17075860"," I also want you guys to see when you're looking to the right hand side of the book map chart,"
"17076730","17084080"," you can see how thick the buyers and sellers are in this red bar and this red bar above. "
"17084680","17091300"," If you were to see a giant red bar above here and they swoop down, you'll see the bar disappear"
"17091300","17095200"," above and you'll see this bar become much thicker."
"17096280","17102880"," Okay, so if you're looking for a moment to pull the plug on some calls or some or some puts,"
"17102880","17104600"," you'll see the same thing below."
"17104960","17106040"," This works on both sides. "
"17107260","17110260"," But if you see the buyers, you see that bar thicker."
"17111500","17112620"," That's support, right?"
"17113220","17117960"," You'll see very minor resistances down below or supports, or excuse me, there's above of your"
"17117960","17118300"," resistance."
"17119180","17122400"," You see some supports down below 46794. "
"17122920","17128920"," A lot of futures traders use a book map for very quick trades, right?"
"17128920","17135760"," 1 minute trades, 5 minute trades, 10 minute trades, and they're using this ice that you see above"
"17135760","17138220"," and below to get in and out of trades."
"17139740","17141420"," You can scale back up over here."
"17141700","17145480"," Another thing that you want to be looking for, so if you're looking right here, you'll see slightly"
"17145480","17147300"," more sellers than buyers at this moment. "
"17147640","17149000"," You'll see the buyers stepping in."
"17149500","17155100"," I do want you to also always, if you have the Hero Indicator on your own charting software, I want"
"17155100","17161180"," you guys to be looking at the Hero Indicator over time."
"17162420","17164920"," So you can do is you can squish this down, right?"
"17166160","17169000"," Let's take a look at the chart for the day. "
"17170520","17173940"," I think I reset this thing around 12."
"17174240","17175860"," Maybe they're loading it right now."
"17177100","17183340"," And so I want you to see here, I'm raising up the Hero Indicator graph, right?"
"17183340","17188580"," It's not showing me the information down below, but now it is. "
"17189360","17191580"," Let's see this nice big swoop up."
"17192160","17193860"," This is call volume."
"17195000","17197760"," And we're not heading down right here. "
"17198400","17200920"," We're just seeing a leveling off of call volume."
"17201560","17203200"," So this is not negative at all."
"17204060","17207180"," But it is showing if high call volume pushes up. "
"17208340","17215980"," If you saw the Hero Indicator dipping right now, even if the price stayed the same, then that would"
"17215980","17217000"," be a negative on the market."
"17217780","17219280"," Right now we're just kind of middle of the day."
"17219620","17220680"," You've just got people buying calls. "
"17221340","17221960"," No one's buying puts."
"17222820","17224180"," This is all positive right here."
"17224640","17225460"," Everything here is positive. "
"17226260","17230780"," But sometimes you'll see the Hero Indicator heading lower and the price will still be higher."
"17231580","17237720"," Sometimes you'll see the Hero Indicator heading higher and the price is heading lower."
"17237720","17240700"," And that's when you can really truly use this. "
"17240840","17246940"," And as a matter of fact, if you look here, right, you have the Hero Indicator right down here."
"17247240","17247980"," It's above here."
"17248380","17250500"," It's starting to raise up here. "
"17250680","17251640"," So we're at 2248."
"17252340","17259960"," You want to track this and see if the call buyers are stepping in from 2500 into the close today."
"17260180","17264160"," Make note of this as we head into the close this afternoon. "
"17266480","17268020"," And it doesn't always work."
"17268160","17271600"," But when it does work, when the Hero Indicator works, it gets pretty wild."
"17271840","17274740"," Like you can actually see a move before it happens. "
"17286920","17289300"," I'm going to bring a smaller time frame here for you."
"17294540","17296480"," Probably don't need a five second time frame."
"17302650","17304830"," It's like a 30 second time frame right here. "
"17317110","17320590"," You can see it forming up here."
"17320590","17325770"," Yeah, the overnight is probably going to crush this into the overnight."
"17345740","17348020"," So my next trade, I'm probably looking up. "
"17348300","17351220"," If you want to ask, if you want to know for me, what do I think is going to happen?"
"17351920","17356360"," I think we're at grind sideways between 2pm and 3pm."
"17357260","17358600"," And then we're going to look to see a move."
"17359260","17362140"," We might see a slight little bit of weakness, let's say. "
"17363800","17365180"," See a little bit of a dip."
"17365420","17370240"," If we don't see the little bit of dip between 2 and 3pm, then we're going to see the dip"
"17370240","17375180"," at some point at like 3.30. So at some point today, expect a dip."
"17375780","17378240"," If you're in calls, you can stay in them if you want. "
"17378740","17380580"," You do whatever you want for your risk profile."
"17382440","17383960"," Because you might miss out, right?"
"17384180","17385180"," No one really cares at this point."
"17385300","17386140"," Everybody knows we're going up. "
"17386820","17389260"," So they might not give the relief valve that we want."
"17390400","17392960"," The best world is we trade down for me."
"17393140","17398020"," If we trade down to 466, I'll buy that dip all day long. "
"17399120","17401560"," So give that to me and I'll buy it all day long."
"17402560","17404060"," Do I think we get down here?"
"17404360","17407320"," Do I think we get down to 466990?"
"17407800","17408140"," Doubt it."
"17409300","17412520"," Do I think we get down to VWAP at 465.59?"
"17418800","17419240"," Doubt it. "
"17421080","17421940"," I'll triple down."
"17422180","17422640"," I'll triple down."
"17422940","17425800"," I'll buy the 470s, but I'm definitely selling at 469. "
"17426640","17428160"," We might trade it straight up."
"17428320","17433740"," If the buy side comes into the close, that rips us to 4792 or something like that."
"17435420","17436260"," Into the bell. "
"17436780","17439600"," I might ride those up or at least until 245 or something."
"17440440","17441560"," But I'm hoping that we get a dip."
"17441760","17446080"," I hope they'll get a bank once to sell us down when we think we're going up. "
"17446700","17447820"," Then we can buy one more dip."
"17448580","17449240"," That's the hope."
"17451720","17454420"," It should be a kick ass trade added in the close either way. "
"17455600","17456760"," We'll see what happens here."
"17478300","17479620"," So I use SG."
"17480320","17481340"," I like SG a lot. "
"17481580","17482540"," They hit their numbers."
"17483840","17489640"," You know, oftentimes they'll hear people in Discord say that SG's numbers suck or what they put out"
"17489640","17493140"," for a deli note sucks or it's not doing that today."
"17493800","17495640"," And I'm like, eh, it kind of is doing that today. "
"17495640","17498560"," I don't think that everybody reads the SG notes enough."
"17499840","17504140"," Or as deep enough as to what the implied moves are, how they happen."
"17505100","17509360"," I think that you, uh, I think you have to put more pieces of the puzzle together. "
"17509860","17516580"," I think when you're reading SG notes, deli notes, and then when you're charting SG out, I think you"
"17516580","17525840"," have to apply them to, you know, all that stuff we talk about, due diligence, your own traditional"
"17525840","17526900"," charting patterns."
"17527740","17529340"," We talked about this earlier this morning, right?"
"17529880","17531300"," You're going to add all this other stuff up."
"17531620","17533360"," There's things that SG can't do. "
"17533820","17536520"," They can't, they don't know what Jay Pao is going to say."
"17536940","17539280"," They don't know what what the market's going to do."
"17539940","17541700"," There's randomness to the market as well. "
"17543020","17544640"," Uh, and you have to take risk on."
"17544820","17546020"," You're going to lose some of your trades."
"17549200","17550600"," I'm going to expect that we trade down. "
"17550720","17553940"," I'm going to expect, I'm hoping that we can grab one of these dips."
"17555260","17558820"," Usually when I chart these things out for grabbing a dip, we don't get as low as I want to"
"17558820","17558980"," buy."
"17561120","17562940"," There is, uh, you want the random trade?"
"17563320","17564500"," You'd wait for 462. "
"17565220","17567920"," We would sell down again all the way to the end of the day."
"17568600","17569200"," It's possible."
"17569820","17571260"," It's, it's on the, it's on the curve. "
"17571340","17572960"," It's like a 10% 5% chance."
"17573500","17574040"," Less than that."
"17574400","17574800"," 5%. "
"17575520","17582200"," Probably 5% 3% chance we traded down to 462 between now and then a day."
"17582780","17588360"," But if I'm looking for a target to buy a dip on where traditional traders want to buy, where a"
"17588360","17589560"," day trader wants to buy."
"17590720","17596700"," A day trader would, a day trader would probably throw his entire count at 465, uh, 87. "
"17597340","17599240"," I posted this on Twitter just a moment ago."
"17600020","17601520"," I posted it by the dip zone."
"17601800","17603680"," It's got like a white dotted line. "
"17603880","17606280"," It's got a solid white line with a yellow dotted line."
"17606820","17609180"," It's got a thick dot or a thick white line on it."

"17629170","17632850"," I know you guys watch some YouTubers that don't tell you actively what to be looking for. "
"17634450","17635410"," It just pinned."
"17635630","17637290"," It just bounced right off of the first line."
"17645820","17647340"," You guys can take a look at these things. "

"17692680","17699720"," It's at its C-A-P-T-A-I-N-S-A-L-P-H-A at Captain's Alpha. "
"17699720","17701760"," You guys request a follow there."
"17701860","17703740"," I'll show you the charts as they come in."
"17704060","17709400"," I posted a chart earlier that showed you the body dip levels for where we are, right?"
"17709500","17710860"," You got a little bit of relief down here. "
"17711200","17714080"," And these don't really match up to what's being shown on BookMap."
"17714480","17717980"," This is the whole point of layering your trades, right?"
"17718980","17720720"," You saw a little bit of ice down below."
"17721200","17726440"," I always see these pro traders in Discord talking about, well, yeah, man, there was ice right here. "
"17726920","17730800"," And I'm like, yeah, you can't really just use BookMap."
"17731020","17734320"," You kind of have to do all the work to get to that point where you know where to buy"
"17734320","17734600"," the dip."
"17742360","17743600"," Raise your blade 705. "
"17744060","17744980"," What the fuck is this drop?"
"17745720","17747020"," Please, love a peat."
"17748380","17749880"," Go over to at Captain's Alpha."
"17750440","17751400"," Sign up for a Twitter account. "
"17752300","17754180"," I'm posting the charts for you guys."
"17754480","17755080"," I'm worried about the dip."
"17757060","17760780"," Yeah, the BTF, the body dip is this white dotted line. "
"17761200","17770020"," Then you've got a serious support at 466.92. Then you've got a greedy day trader like me."
"17772520","17780780"," Greedy, greedy day trader like me wants to buy it like 466.02. If I can buy that dip between"
"17780780","17782620"," now and 345 or 330."
"17783660","17784460"," Hello, ladies. "
"17785620","17790220"," That would send me from 466 to 469."
"17791040","17791480"," 470."
"17792140","17796600"," Possibly even making a trade to 472 or 3 on tomorrow. "
"17797660","17799060"," Maybe a 70 point rip."
"17800200","17801320"," I don't think I get that though."
"17801920","17803760"," I think that the smart traders already know. "
"17804440","17808200"," I think the aggressive bull traders already know where we're headed."
"17810760","17812240"," They're going to trade it on the one minute."
"17812300","17814060"," They're going to grab the dip at the highest level. "
"17814860","17818100"," And even when you look at these four support levels, that's three of them."
"17818240","17819880"," One, two, three, right?"
"17820320","17821540"," You can just take a thousand bucks."
"17821540","17826260"," You buy $300 worth of this dip right here right now. "
"17826860","17829880"," You buy another $300 if we dip, dip, dip lower."
"17830800","17833040"," Then you throw $300 more dollars at the next dip."
"17833720","17838720"," And you ride this bitch straight into 469, 470, 473. "
"17840620","17841520"," It's pretty easy."
"17842520","17844500"," Unless there's some news that we don't know about."
"17847200","17848760"," Yeah, and there's no zero dates, right?"
"17848840","17849780"," Or there are zero dates, right?"
"17849920","17850940"," We got zero dates for tomorrow. "
"17851640","17853620"," We got Wednesday calls that are expiring."
"17853860","17854080"," Sure."
"17854360","17854980"," Buy them for Friday. "
"17858680","17860600"," I agree with the CPI data thing."
"17860800","17865600"," The only thing that I don't agree with the CPI data thing is that the Fed just told you they"
"17865600","17867140"," don't give a flying shit about the CPI."
"17868140","17869560"," But they'll apply tools. "
"17870400","17871320"," That's the real key."
"17871800","17876560"," That's the things that bears and bulls need to know, both sides."
"17876560","17879500"," Like you guys need to know what is important. "
"17880380","17884250"," I want to give a shout out to Matthias."
"17885270","17887390"," JetPazz just donated 20 bucks."
"17887610","17888110"," Thank you, brother. "
"17888730","17889430"," Appreciate it."
"17891670","17892970"," Seriously appreciate it."
"17893150","17893390"," You guys. "
"17893850","17895530"," So you guys tip today."
"17895810","17897610"," So I had some tips today."
"17897670","17897870"," Okay. "
"17898250","17903330"," So I'm going to buy the tonight before tomorrow for you guys tipping today."
"17904130","17910730"," I think it costs me like 20 or 50 bucks a month to get the spoofing add on."
"17911050","17911970"," I don't know what it costs. "
"17912170","17913750"," It could cost 20 bucks or 100 bucks."
"17914270","17918830"," But I will grab the spoofing add on tomorrow for you guys tipping today."
"17920370","17921770"," So I'll buy that add on tomorrow. "
"17921930","17924390"," We'll start to see the spoofing as of tomorrow."
"17924850","17927890"," I will have the spoofing add on for the book map."
"17928470","17929670"," I appreciate you guys tipping. "
"17929970","17930770"," So you guys tipping?"
"17931190","17932010"," I'll buy that shit."
"17932010","17932450"," It's done."
"17933410","17934210"," It's done deal. "
"17934370","17935190"," I'll have the spoofing."
"17935270","17936190"," It's really neat too."
"17936450","17939170"," It shows up over here on the right hand side. "
"17939290","17940730"," I've got another thing to show you guys too."
"17941270","17942670"," I'll show you guys."
"17942770","17943670"," I don't know if it works on. "
"17943830","17944890"," I think it might only work on futures."
"17946370","17949390"," But SG offers a third column over here."
"17949730","17951150"," But don't think it works on cash. "
"17951470","17952550"," I'll check to see if it does."
"17953530","17959530"," I think it only works on SPX on cash market and ES on futures market."
"17961150","17962770"," But there's another. "
"17963030","17963790"," It's not."
"17963970","17964910"," I think what the fuck it's called."
"17965390","17966830"," I don't think it works on cash market. "
"17967090","17970490"," But I'll add the spoofing add on tonight for donating."
"17970830","17971390"," I appreciate it."
"17972350","17973910"," You guys have said money in?"
"17974190","17974750"," No worries. "
"17975070","17975890"," Let's pump this shit up."
"17976030","17980970"," I want to see us have all the information that we can have to trade every day."
"17982750","17984470"," So I'll have that for you tomorrow. "
"17984610","17985510"," I can't wait to have it on here."
"17985810","17987230"," I'm going to be kind of stoked with it."
"17988210","17990350"," Maybe we'll take a look at some point at the add-ons. "
"17990790","17991730"," We can put on book map."
"17992470","17993550"," Because it'd be really cool to have."
"17993770","17995310"," So there's a bunch of. "
"17995910","17997230"," The heroin decay is my favorite."
"17997710","18002610"," But there's a bunch of cool ass add-ons for book map to anticipate what's going to happen in the"
"18002610","18002870"," market."
"18008500","18009420"," And some of them are expensive. "
"18010240","18011960"," Like this is the shit that the pros use."
"18012360","18013560"," Not just the pro trader at home."
"18013700","18018160"," I'm talking like here's some hedge funds that use this stuff and they're probably paying like a"
"18018160","18018740"," thousand bucks. "
"18018740","18023440"," $1,500 a month for this in a boiler room per license."
"18024460","18027180"," So you get like 10 guys in a boiler room, 10k a month."
"18027600","18028060"," They don't care. "
"18036140","18038300"," Yeah, we got CPI tomorrow at 8 30 in the morning."
"18040100","18041460"," We've got the inflation data."
"18041980","18046100"," Most definitely the talk today and yesterday was about we have our tools. "
"18046680","18051020"," Meaning that we'll fight inflation or that if the inflation number comes out that."
"18051660","18053600"," If the inflation number comes out, it's important."
"18055560","18059980"," But the so the idea would be if the inflation data comes out tomorrow hot. "
"18061000","18064300"," That the implication is that we're going to tighten."
"18066300","18067760"," And we're going to drop the market."
"18068020","18069220"," That's the implication of CPI. "
"18070140","18072620"," And so what chase I think others are trying to make the point that."
"18073620","18076520"," Jay Pao is saying don't worry if we fall."
"18077480","18080160"," We've got our tools to raise the market back up. "
"18096970","18099690"," Let's take a broader look at the market and see what's going on here."
"18102330","18106130"," Another brew blue line setting itself up at 4 79 86."
"18106770","18108790"," Looks like sellers might be coming a little bit lower. "
"18112230","18113990"," And chase you might like seeing this."
"18114850","18117350"," If any guys are still in put spreads or anything."
"18118510","18120290"," This line is becoming more apparent. "
"18121910","18127090"," Well, you guys to see this for 4 50 10."
"18129030","18132390"," There are more buyers stepping in here in case we trade down to 450."
"18133050","18135430"," That line was not here this morning. "
"18136030","18137090"," It wasn't here at all this week."
"18137590","18139470"," I think we saw a light blue line."
"18144270","18146470"," On once they saw light blue line. "
"18146690","18148850"," But this is new the past couple hours."
"18149550","18151070"," This 4 53."
"18154630","18157770"," So maybe if you take the market long and you put a put spread out of 450. "
"18159970","18160830"," For OpEx."
"18161950","18165230"," And this is stayed the same all morning 4 62 12."
"18166750","18167890"," Be aware of that. "
"18172130","18176130"," There is some and you see these sellers are disappearing above at 4 73."
"18177530","18179990"," That's important to note as we make our way through the day."
"18186360","18189320"," Definitely note that for 50 number even if you're a bull. "
"18191260","18194920"," No, my my my my thought process is possibly."
"18196920","18199900"," I know that we have a caller on the market down to."
"18200480","18202580"," Does anybody remember what that caller was JPM gave?"
"18208550","18210930"," Was I doing I do anticipate us trading down. "
"18211690","18212450"," Excuse me."
"18213230","18214110"," Into March."
"18215610","18218230"," I don't know if that is for forming up for. "
"18219890","18221470"," For this month's OpEx."
"18222130","18228510"," That wasn't here before just heads up that for 50 supply zone that by side is new."
"18229170","18230070"," At 450. "
"18233650","18234630"," This was not here."
"18234850","18235670"," So see this right here."
"18236690","18237910"," This was not here. "
"18239490","18241410"," This morning it wasn't here yesterday."
"18242230","18243690"," We had buyers swing up."
"18244550","18246130"," And by the market and then we saw this. "
"18246470","18248530"," I don't know what at what time this came online, but."
"18249230","18250870"," I didn't check this low."
"18251490","18253270"," I checked the slow at 11 o'clock. "
"18253430","18255170"," So I would say this came online around 12."
"18255890","18256890"," One o'clock this afternoon."
"18258690","18262030"," Keep this in focus here as we head into OpEx. "
"18264770","18265430"," For the month."
"18265850","18268590"," I don't think this is the swing low for March."
"18268830","18270530"," I think the swing low for March is much deeper. "
"18271490","18273010"," But I'm wondering about it."
"18273110","18274050"," I see this one right here."
"18274230","18274750"," Wait a minute. "
"18275330","18276670"," I missed this one too."
"18277710","18278590"," Let's take a look at this one."
"18279850","18281590"," Let's see a little bit closer look. "
"18285030","18289050"," A little light blue band setting up down here at 459, 460."
"18290410","18292970"," Another one getting a little bit stronger down here at 462."
"18294130","18295790"," I want to see if these consolidate. "
"18300340","18302280"," You know how they'd use news to around it."
"18302440","18304800"," The one thing is one day ultra bullish."
"18305380","18307080"," And then the next day we're talking about. "
"18307380","18307560"," All right."
"18307680","18309040"," We're going to buy the Diva 450 again."
"18310220","18316300"," Now you see a trade down to 450 ugliness right into the opening bell of next Thursday. "
"18317740","18318780"," Or into the 20th."
"18319640","18322480"," You see some ugly nastiness down to 450 in the 20th."
"18323160","18325960"," And then all of a sudden we're trading up to 470 on. "
"18325960","18330300"," The 21st or the 20th itself at the end of the day."
"18330800","18337180"," I think the last time we did that we traded like it was either 70 points or 130 points in"
"18337180","18337720"," one day."
"18340240","18343580"," And there was a guy who noted a yesterday on. "
"18344920","18345960"," On Twitter."
"18347080","18348900"," I actually got a respect."
"18350320","18352900"," And he was talking about the violent swings. "
"18360090","18362650"," So I'm anticipating still though that we trade higher."
"18363570","18364890"," Right here you can see it."
"18365610","18365970"," 469. "
"18367050","18367850"," Right into the bell."
"18369490","18370910"," So I'm going to wait for my next trade."
"18371690","18373750"," I'm going to look for a little bit of weakness here. "
"18374350","18376350"," We bounced off that dotted white line."
"18376470","18379490"," If we can bounce below at some point between now and 3 p.m. I'm going to be a happy"
"18379490","18379730"," man."
"18381050","18383350"," If we don't get it at some point I'll just buy again. "
"18383910","18385410"," And I'm going to take that trade into the close."
"18386690","18389310"," I'm going to take the trade right into that 470."
"18391150","18393350"," Probably take a trade to hold overnight. "
"18395670","18396550"," Even with CPI."
"18397870","18400150"," The only thing that really matters right now is with the Fed saying."
"18400290","18401510"," The Fed saying the money printer is on. "
"18402410","18403130"," And that is the key."
"18404270","18405450"," Money printer on."
"18406530","18408050"," My expectations for the spy. "
"18408610","18408910"," Not 500."
"18410530","18413070"," You guys can anyway any guys talking about 500 right now."
"18413110","18414050"," I think that's off the table. "
"18415010","18416590"," I think 470 is on the table."
"18416890","18418230"," I think 475 is on the table."
"18418810","18420290"," I think we wish for 478. "
"18420930","18422550"," I think you're going to find people on social media."
"18422550","18423630"," Sam are going to 478."
"18424410","18426730"," And they want you to buy calls to 478. "
"18426950","18427050"," 480."
"18428390","18430270"," 500 so that we expand the trading range."
"18431050","18432330"," But until we see those calls. "
"18433590","18435010"," The ceiling is probably truly."
"18436030","18436310"," 475."
"18439190","18441170"," Maybe a ripper to 478 for a minute. "
"18442030","18443890"," So we're sideways trading right now."
"18446930","18448270"," And making money in both ends."
"18457990","18461210"," I just want to make sure that I state that. "
"18462130","18467350"," Every derivative of Spyder S&P 500 correlates to SPX."
"18468190","18469830"," ES correlates to SPX."
"18470490","18471790"," Spy correlates to SPX. "
"18472630","18473990"," Everything starts from SPX."
"18475470","18476650"," Winky, did I say something?"
"18476890","18477830"," I might have misspoken."
"18478430","18479250"," We all know. "
"18479450","18484350"," Hopefully we all know SPX is the mother of all of these derivative trades."
"18488580","18489860"," SPX is the godfather."
"18490680","18491160"," Period. "
"18491600","18491940"," And a story."
"18515320","18517100"," Oh, I see what you're saying."
"18517240","18517900"," I went winky face. "
"18518640","18519840"," Yeah, so let's explain that."
"18520080","18521720"," Let's go further on that point then."
"18522720","18523220"," So. "
"18525120","18529800"," SPX is the SPX is the spy."
"18530140","18530760"," That's what it is."
"18531000","18531180"," Okay. "
"18532140","18533580"," The spy is not SPX."
"18534080","18535460"," So there's SPX."
"18535660","18536760"," There's the S&P 500. "
"18537720","18543140"," Now each derivative runs upon different contracts."
"18544100","18549280"," Some have a contract that is always and forever."
"18549280","18553320"," If you trade the spy, the contract is the same. "
"18553840","18562340"," Now, even though the spy has one contract, there are different contracts for other derivatives that"
"18562340","18564760"," impact the price of the spy."
"18565680","18566700"," ES is one of them."
"18567580","18568620"," SPX is the same thing. "
"18568720","18569380"," They run on contracts."
"18570140","18571540"," These are future contracts, right?"
"18572000","18573920"," There's a contract of what we think it's going to be in the future."
"18574600","18575920"," And they don't always match up. "
"18575920","18582380"," And so you have to sometimes at certain points in the area, you have to ask somebody, Hey, which"
"18582380","18583760"," contract are you running on?"
"18584760","18589320"," You'll hear people in social media say, we're going to know real price tomorrow or we're going to"
"18589320","18591200"," know real price this week."
"18597700","18599120"," And you can't equal them."
"18599240","18601500"," They're close, but they're not equal. "
"18601900","18606440"," You'll notice when I put out support and resistance levels, you know what I'll do?"
"18606440","18614560"," If you guys want, I'll put support and resistance levels out for SPX, ES, and spy."
"18616440","18622720"," For the current contract and ES, I'll put out three support levels for all three tomorrow so that"
"18622720","18623600"," you can compare them."
"18624220","18629920"," And what's really weird is that they get really weird at certain times of the month and the"
"18629920","18630240"," quarter. "
"18640190","18641210"," And they don't match up."
"18641210","18644770"," But horseshoes and hen grenades, if you're charting for the day."
"18645450","18650950"," Typically, if I get ES levels, I'll place them on a spy chart. "
"18651890","18654130"," And then I'll adjust them to where they should be."
"18655110","18656990"," And you can usually do that with an eyeball."
"18660000","18661420"," You guys want them consistently?"
"18662560","18663080"," Do you guys want?"
"18663320","18664560"," I can give you guys. "
"18665060","18671460"," If you guys want SNR levels for SPX, spy, and ES every day, I can do that."
"18671460","18672600"," It takes me like 30 seconds."
"18674100","18675480"," I can do that shit for you guys. "
"18676500","18679340"," I'll give you guys the exact levels for all three."
"18680620","18685620"," The only time that I can say no to this is when the contracts are ending and starting."
"18686480","18687020"," Because I know. "
"18688880","18692220"," Especially as futures traders, you glowbacks, shitheads out there."
"18693600","18696800"," You guys are like, well, which contract are you trading?"
"18697360","18698880"," Are you trading the current contract?"
"18699200","18701540"," Or are you trading the January contract?"
"18702380","18704180"," Because I'm still on last month's contract."
"18704640","18707020"," Oh, well, I'm trading next month's contract already, bro. "
"18707520","18708940"," You got to make your own mind up."
"18714330","18715550"," All right, I'll do it for you."
"18716670","18721470"," All right, so every day from this point forward, you're going to get all three contracts. "
"18723610","18724350"," Yeah, it does."
"18724350","18728530"," And the contract roll gets complicated, and people fight about it all day long."
"18730770","18733850"," So once a month, once every three months, you might see me. "
"18735070","18740630"," You might see people yelling at me and saying you get the wrong contract or I'm trading the wrong"
"18740630","18741950"," contract right now or whatever."
"18744570","18745810"," Yeah, every three months or so."
"18751170","18753290"," Yeah, Jeff Anderson's laughing at that comment. "
"18753290","18757510"," Yeah, Bob Walsh is explaining the same thing that they do become the same."
"18758050","18759910"," And they do become exactly the same."
"18759990","18761030"," And that's when you hear real price. "
"18761250","18761870"," You'll hear people."
"18762410","18763850"," You'll hear people out there."
"18763970","18766750"," They'll say, especially if we're in the high, especially if you're a bear. "
"18767210","18768210"," You're like bearish."
"18768290","18770390"," You're like, you're like, don't worry asshole."
"18771830","18773590"," You'll see the real price tomorrow. "
"18774410","18775510"," And that does really hurt."
"18775730","18777810"," Like if you're if you're trading options contracts."
"18779550","18781910"," And you're all highfalutin and we're flying high. "
"18781910","18785550"," And then all of a sudden you look at your your options on Monday morning."
"18786050","18788630"," And we're up right a point or two."
"18788930","18790530"," But your options are shit in the bed. "
"18790990","18793510"," Or we're down a point or two and your puts are shit in the bed."
"18794030","18795370"," That's because of the rollover of contracts."
"18800210","18802010"," Oh, winky, good point, winky. "
"18802350","18806130"," Most of the people that fight about ES contract really use it as a way to explain whether trades"
"18806130","18807830"," they post on Twitter are shit."
"18810590","18811030"," Hilarious."
"18817740","18818180"," Hilarious. "
"18818600","18820080"," It is true."
"18820580","18822480"," It is true because you're right though."
"18822840","18824000"," Not only that, right?"
"18824160","18827760"," But you'll see you'll see the trade go to the previous contract. "
"18827780","18830980"," And then it'll shift to the new current contract."
"18832180","18833560"," And people get pissed off."
"18840520","18841700"," Yeah, that is a good rule of thumb. "
"18842100","18842980"," Stop run city has a right."
"18844000","18846100"," That is the general rules about a week before."
"18848000","18850500"," Futures, traders typically will ask each other. "
"18851160","18853180"," Have you rolled into the new contract yet or not?"
"18853340","18855780"," They'll just check and make sure everybody's on the same contract."
"18856580","18860000"," Usually you'll see that roll the week before and you'll start asking people."
"18860240","18862800"," And that is a good thing that people do is they're always checking with each other. "
"18863340","18864480"," And people forget."
"18865220","18868260"," People stay in the wrong contract and they're still trading the old contract."
"18871030","18871430"," Yep. "
"18873270","18874570"," Guess I'm a Glovex asshole."
"18875110","18878390"," I was used to be a futures trader."
"18878550","18879010"," I don't do it anymore. "
"18879490","18880490"," I don't do Glovex anymore."
"18880610","18881390"," I got to sleep guys."
"18881890","18883330"," Like you guys are up all night long. "
"18884390","18886830"," Now I'm doing research at three, four o'clock in the morning."
"18887370","18892330"," I have one specific futures trader, a baller that I talked to in the morning on Discord."
"18894310","18898970"," And we're usually exchanging information back and forth from what his experience was the night"
"18898970","18902310"," before to what I'm trying to figure out is going to happen at cash market. "
"18902890","18909370"," And to be honest with you guys, if you're a cash trader, you should always have one person out"
"18909370","18914550"," there that you're friends with that can give you information on the overnight contract."
"18915670","18919990"," And if you're an overnight trader, it always helps to have the perspective of a cash trader."
"18921410","18923110"," Because they both hate each other. "
"18923270","18925130"," They both have their viewpoints on what they're doing."
"18925590","18927430"," They're usually not in agreement completely."
"18927430","18932690"," A Glovex overnight trader has a lot of information on what's going on in the global market. "
"18933210","18939370"," When it's really important, not just in the global market, the Glovex market, but when the implied"
"18939370","18942610"," or when the implication affects the actual cash market."
"18943230","18947110"," You'll hear sometimes like, oh they're PJ traders, there's only six of them, that's not true."
"18948750","18951830"," Sometimes you'll hear, oh the euro rich and the euro poor are trading now. "
"18952450","18957030"," And what they're really trying to tell you in the background is that a lot of these Glovex traders"
"18957030","18959470"," can tell you when it matters and when it doesn't."
"18959870","18962010"," And the cash market has that same implication, right?"
"18962310","18965470"," You saw last night Tesla trade down in the Glovex session."
"18966170","18968370"," And it was an easy short down last night. "
"18968810","18971050"," But then it got picked up again in the cash session today, right?"
"18971210","18974650"," So Glovex traders always want to see what's taking place in the cash market."
"18974910","18980570"," And it impacts what dealers selling dealers buying in the overnight with the bots or doing what the"
"18980570","18981530"," banks are saying to do."
"18986250","18988870"," Yeah, blood stuns putting out some good information right now too. "
"18992110","18995270"," Yeah, I don't know how you guys sleep doing, I don't know how few futures traders sleep."
"18996950","18998610"," There's at least 12 PJ traders."
"19003660","19006160"," Yeah, stop run city makes a good point too. "
"19006620","19011600"," Sometimes you'll watch like a YouTube channel for a futures trader and they come and they go."
"19012140","19016400"," Like they'll be like a futures trader will have a YouTube channel right live trading and they'll"
"19016400","19018380"," come on board and they'll say, no, it's not."
"19018520","19019360"," It's not the right time. "
"19020000","19021580"," I'm going to sign off right now."
"19021920","19025900"," It's because if you're a futures trader, if you're looking at key levels of support and resistance,"
"19026520","19032820"," you can actually make some banging trades, banging trades, banging, banging, banging moves."
"19039780","19041120"," We sleep very peacefully. "
"19041980","19046920"," A bunch of futures traders just have alerts that have major support and resistance and says they"
"19046920","19048920"," sleep in between and then they wait for those to come up."
"19049740","19056100"," Especially when it's, dude, you guys in cash market, I watch these cash traders and they're taking"
"19056100","19057520"," a long position into overnight."
"19057900","19063840"," I take longs and overnight sometimes in shorts and overnight on cash market, but I see some long"
"19063840","19068580"," traders that just were just like right at resistance and I'm like, man, this is like the sweetest"
"19068580","19075300"," effing setup for a futures trader to just sell us down to the tip depths of hell. "
"19076100","19081600"," How do you take a long position cash and not be able to hedge in futures?"
"19082480","19083460"," Hedge short."
"19085520","19094700"," If some of you guys are carrying shorter long positions in cash market, do yourself a favor, sign"
"19094700","19100580"," up for a brokerage that you can trade futures in so that you can live hedge your positions."
"19100580","19104120"," So if you're like paranoid, if you're like one of those guys that are up like me up all night"
"19104120","19109520"," long, need a long FD call, hoping for a gap up the next morning. "
"19110760","19115240"," If you don't see that gap up and you see the markets start burning, you can at least enter into"
"19115240","19118840"," a futures trade and sell down and reclaim what you lost in cash."
"19123300","19124780"," Listen to razor blade over here."
"19125120","19126320"," Wake up at 0,300. "
"19128440","19136540"," 0,400, sleep till 8, then have a nap at 4.15 to 6 p.m. Oh, yeah, that overnight"
"19136540","19137780"," last month was fucking crazy."
"19138160","19140740"," Oh, dude, some of you guys are longtime traders."
"19143040","19144940"," It's tied up SPX option trades. "
"19145280","19149380"," Start getting tied to the next quarterly that the two wins is before the quarterly expiration."
"19150180","19150920"," Good point."
"19151880","19153240"," You guys want to know about crazy?"
"19153240","19163220"," No, the old traders know this, but like not since 2018, I'm going to say 2018, 2008,"
"19165280","19167440"," 2014 and 15 somewhere in there. "
"19167900","19174360"," And then 2020 and 21, you would have like 4%, 5% swings in the overnight."
"19175540","19177180"," And then we'll be back to normal by open."
"19178680","19181820"," I'm talking like a 4% swing in overnight futures. "
"19182600","19182980"," That's insane."
"19184720","19189520"," Yeah, I used to do that."
"19189620","19191060"," Stay up all night long in a bad trade. "
"19193140","19195260"," The SPX and VIX trades overnight now."
"19200040","19202660"," We're being talking about 4%, 5% trading."
"19203420","19206720"," So I told you people yesterday, I was like, I'm one of these Democrats, these old school Democrats,"
"19207720","19209220"," but I have like a trader hat and a main street hat. "
"19209900","19211720"," How do I go to a barbecue and tell my friends?"
"19212900","19218580"," Well, I prefer Trump as a president because it makes me more money in the market."
"19219820","19221480"," Like, how do I say that to my friends?"
"19222940","19224360"," Like, I'm a Democrat."
"19224900","19226180"," I fucking hate Trump. "
"19227020","19229280"," But as a trader, fucking love him."
"19229960","19233400"," I think I want any kind of president that's going to make the markets swing like that."
"19234080","19236320"," Like, how do I contemplate that in my life?"
"19237620","19241980"," You know, it is bizarre, like bizarre out there saying, why don't I like him?"
"19242180","19244520"," Because he's swung the market 4% every day. "
"19244960","19246080"," He's swung it at night time."
"19246420","19247200"," He's swung it in the daytime."
"19250900","19253160"," Now I got, you get Biden right now. "
"19253520","19255320"," He gently gets into markets."
"19255640","19257320"," He's like, oh, I can move a market."
"19257480","19259000"," I'm like, yeah, man, get in there and move the market. "
"19259380","19262980"," If Biden was moving the market 4% to 5% every day, I'd love him too."
"19263400","19266340"," I love any president that swings the market 4% to 5% every day."
"19266340","19269880"," I don't care what party they're from. "
"19277720","19278960"," Yeah, I'm not a party guy."
"19279200","19280280"," I'm not in any party myself."
"19281860","19285380"," You know, I don't care which party you're from, what your positions are. "
"19285760","19290140"," But if my trader had, like the end of the day money in my bank account, I'll take any president"
"19290140","19292960"," that's moving the market 4% to 5% in a day."
"19303180","19304100"," You're almost there."
"19304240","19306560"," It's $2.38. Lots of consolidation. "
"19308800","19310000"," Lots of consolidation."
"19321440","19323460"," Yeah, I don't, yeah."
"19329100","19331940"," Yeah, when Trump was in office, hell no, you couldn't sleep. "
"19332800","19334440"," Dude, I would be a dude."
"19341570","19342010"," Yes."
"19342290","19350070"," Yeah, as a journalist, as anything that you are in your real life, it was hard to embrace Trump. "
"19350310","19353550"," But dude, as a trader, I mean, you're, dude, you're tired."
"19353550","19357230"," I remember back, I remember recently, like, I think this was in 2020."
"19357950","19361210"," Trump would say some shit like, it'd be like 3.45 in the afternoon. "
"19362270","19363490"," That'd be long as fuck."
"19363610","19365330"," It'd be like super long, like 3."
"19365910","19367310"," 3.45 in the afternoon."
"19368050","19369070"," Everything would say we're going up. "
"19369390","19371330"," Everything is said we're going crazy the next day."
"19371990","19372790"," Like super high."
"19373090","19375070"," Trump would say China deals off. "
"19376750","19379510"," My calls would just, they would go to hell."
"19379870","19380750"," Like depths of hell."
"19380750","19386270"," And so the choice becomes, do I buy the depths of hell into the closing bell?"
"19387030","19387510"," Right?"
"19387750","19389950"," So let's say you buy the closing depths of hell into the bell. "
"19390410","19396250"," Then after the bell, right, we would crash to the 5% like literally 5%."
"19396250","19402970"," And then literally by 930 AM, we were back 5% plus 5%."
"19402970","19406870"," He'd come in at like 8 o'clock in the morning and he would say something insane. "
"19407290","19409470"," Like, oh, by the way, the China deals back on."
"19409470","19414190"," And he'd be like, dude, what the fuck just happened?"
"19418260","19420180"," Like, it was insane."
"19421180","19422020"," It was insane. "
"19422460","19423000"," Some of those swings."
"19424460","19426060"," Do you guys remember that shit?"
"19426560","19429260"," You guys remember how crazy and sane that shit was?"
"19431880","19438920"," Your wife's boyfriend wants to see us go to 470 right now."
"19444300","19445820"," Dude, the Trump market, no offense. "
"19446060","19450440"," I mean, I can't say is like, if I put my main street hat on, yeah, I'm going to be"
"19450440","19451060"," like fuck Trump."
"19451260","19452640"," Seriously, honestly, God is guys."
"19453040","19454100"," Like, I got to say fuck Trump. "
"19454400","19456160"," But I can't put my made street hat on."
"19456480","19458680"," I'm like an awkward penguin walking around town."
"19459240","19464820"," I'm like, I'm like, I'm sorry, but we just traded like, you know, I just made more money than God"
"19464820","19465220"," today. "
"19465500","19467220"," I made more money than anybody else out here."
"19470470","19472190"," Sorry, I'll get past the Trump part."
"19474710","19476110"," Dude, don't get me wrong. "
"19476230","19476950"," I'm not a fan of Trump."
"19477190","19480550"," I just, the markets were in Sano."
"19482650","19485010"," The markets were fucking in Sano. "
"19487070","19489730"," You know, he's been doing it recently as Biden."
"19490350","19493330"," Recently, Biden has realized that he can move the markets."
"19495330","19496850"," And if Biden did that, it'd be stoked. "
"19497830","19500390"," Better fact, I bet if Biden did that, he would win."
"19500690","19506450"," He would lock in a win for the next cycle if he just swung markets higher."
"19507730","19510050"," That's kind of crazy to say that, right?"
"19511690","19514050"," Swing markets higher on your win the next election. "
"19515290","19515810"," Bizarre."
"19518970","19520770"," So bizarre how the system works."
"19523290","19525270"," Yeah, this market trades slower. "
"19526130","19533670"," If you're a newer trader or you like stability in the market, this market doesn't trade nearly as"
"19533670","19534950"," violently as it used to."
"19535850","19539750"," It's been way more defined, way more defined."
"19541890","19543690"," I mean, dude, we would stay up. "
"19543910","19545030"," I would stay up all night long."
"19545190","19545610"," I couldn't sleep."
"19546610","19547850"," That was how crazy it was. "
"19548050","19548690"," You couldn't sleep."
"19549770","19551410"," You didn't know what would happen by morning."
"19552850","19556210"," You'd be bloodbath, like bloodbath, both sides. "
"19556610","19557570"," Bullbear didn't matter."
"19558110","19559990"," You have a bloodbath on your hands on either side."
"19564210","19565430"," That was wild town. "
"19565750","19568950"," Every day in the Trump admin was like a live HBO drama series."
"19569370","19570310"," Dude, there was Encino."
"19572690","19573870"," I don't like the stability. "
"19577370","19579110"," Yeah, they're all the same."
"19580790","19583010"," If I had to guess Trump was playing the market."
"19583010","19584250"," If I had to guess, he was. "
"19587130","19588030"," He had to be."
"19588250","19589010"," They all had to be."
"19592990","19594570"," Yeah, it is too trunched to these days. "
"19597450","19598130"," So what do you got?"
"19598950","19600450"," You guys want to see what's up with SDC?"
"19601030","19601710"," I'll bring up SDC."
"19601990","19603270"," I'll bring up Qs real quick for you."
"19604110","19605250"," It's been loading all day long. "
"19605890","19608870"," You guys want to see Qs crashing into the top up here?"
"19610150","19610970"," Great day for the Qs."
"19611090","19611650"," They're down at 380."
"19614570","19615550"," Smashing into 385. "
"19616770","19620170"," This would be the squeeze opportunity for the spy."
"19621010","19626270"," So if you're looking right now at the spy at 46871, you want to know if we're going to crash"
"19626270","19627190"," above right now."
"19627710","19629470"," We're coming into 243 in the hour. "
"19629950","19633030"," We have 10% more buyers and sellers on Qs."
"19633550","19639870"," I do want you to see that this would be the setup for a long on the Qs and the"
"19639870","19640050"," spy."
"19643180","19644580"," Where are the sellers at?"
"19645180","19646300"," If you really want to know, right?"
"19647660","19652760"," This is where that wall is above here on the Qs. "
"19652900","19658100"," NQ is going to be 385.89. Looks like these sellers are coming in and out over here."
"19661560","19663460"," I'm looking for a ceiling above it."
"19663620","19664460"," It's up here. "
"19665160","19665640"," 389."
"19666600","19667180"," Let's call it."
"19667440","19673520"," We've got more wall up here at 386.89. And that's 385.80. So I'm going to turn this one"
"19673520","19674060"," off real quick. "
"19674200","19674740"," We're going to look at SD."
"19675880","19680060"," I have some love in my heart for the old school Wall Street Bets."
"19681000","19685520"," Maybe you guys can screenshot this and post this on an IMGUR. "
"19686580","19688280"," And give this to the..."
"19688280","19691860"," Many of you guys are still active in Wall Street Bets."
"19692480","19696780"," You guys want to see what the real deal is for the Wall Street Bets crowd?"
"19697560","19697940"," We'll do that."
"19699560","19701580"," We still have some love for Wall Street Bets. "
"19701980","19704540"," I don't know how well BookMap will say it."
"19704680","19705700"," If this is the bottom or not."
"19706380","19708240"," But you guys can take a screenshot of this. "
"19709200","19710860"," Show it to the Wall Street Bets crowd."
"19714330","19717910"," Let's see if we can find bottom on SD."
"19721010","19722210"," Where is SD bottom?"
"19723390","19725050"," It's for the Wall Street Bets people. "
"19730660","19740520"," All right, so bottom on SD is $10.87. Ridiculous sellers"
"19740520","19744060"," above at 1192."
"19744840","19752040"," The key that you need to know about this is that on the CVD buyers and sellers, there you have"
"19752040","19753320"," way more sellers than buyers."
"19753980","19757780"," So if you want to tell somebody in Wall Street Bets out there, you want to say this is not"
"19757780","19758220"," the bottom. "
"19758860","19760000"," And more than likely is not."
"19760780","19769780"," Your bottom on SD is $10.88. And you have stupid more sellers than buyers."
"19771780","19772980"," Okay, so there you go. "
"19773940","19776440"," Now you can look like a hero in Wall Street Bets."
"19785130","19795200"," Spies trading up at $4.68.81. You've"
"19795200","19797320"," got a buy program that looks like it's starting."
"19797320","19798840"," Sometimes we fake out here. "
"19799280","19802300"," I do want you to realize that sometimes we get this buy program."
"19803460","19808740"," You can see that we've got more sellers than buyers on the second."
"19810040","19812600"," But overall we have more buyers than sellers. "
"19813420","19815120"," We have major call flow coming in."
"19815580","19817780"," This is the expectation that we talked about earlier, right?"
"19818000","19821540"," Is that people know we're going to look above."
"19822340","19828040"," If I was a futures trader, I would be looking for two moves. "
"19828200","19834400"," I'd be looking for us to trade up to this $4.69.05. We're about to get there right now."
"19836040","19837560"," Now we're going to trade up to here."
"19837880","19845000"," Possibly trade up to let's call it $4.69.63. And if you were ultra bullish into the close, it"
"19845000","19849020"," would be $4.70.92. And if you're looking for futures to carry us over. "
"19849020","19856560"," PJ traders, believe it or not, will trade us up or down, depending upon market direction."
"19858540","19860020"," For a look above or a look below."
"19860580","19862140"," They look for these moments here. "
"19862440","19867940"," So let's say right now we didn't, we had no news or we had, let's say tomorrow we're scared about"
"19867940","19868240"," the news."
"19868580","19870980"," Like we have, let's say at Fed Fair Chair Powell coming out tomorrow."
"19872320","19877400"," Then let's say we were coming into $4.69.470. And we had Fed Chair Powell tomorrow. "
"19877660","19882760"," I would say as a futures trader, I would say, well hopefully we trade up to $4.69.470. So"
"19882760","19884600"," that I can sell that bitch down into the open tomorrow."
"19885400","19890420"," Now if we had Fed Chair, which we did today, then you know that the look is above."
"19890580","19893940"," You know that we didn't sell off immediately when, when Chair Powell talked. "
"19894380","19896760"," So you know that the, that they need to look above."
"19896920","19898000"," And so where's the look above area?"
"19898440","19903060"," Look above area is above the $4.70 area, right?"
"19903620","19905420"," This is the gamma flip."
"19905420","19907120"," This is the volatility trigger. "
"19907600","19908980"," This is you can call whatever you want."
"19909480","19914420"," The volatility trigger is at four, I believe it's 4.71.40. I will take a look and see exactly"
"19914420","19914960"," where it is."
"19916360","19924100"," It's the volatility trigger started at 4.7.14. And it ended at 4.700. So more than likely the"
"19924100","19926800"," expectation is we move up to 4.700 into the close. "
"19927460","19931420"," You'll wait for futures to either sell it down or bring it above."
"19931420","19938360"," But from where we were this morning, for the second test below, I still think we test the third"
"19938360","19942180"," time lower, but the market wants to see a higher."
"19943160","19948560"," And if a cash market can't do it, the futures, well, the algos will do it and the futures traders"
"19948560","19950680"," will do it in the overnight. "
"19953510","19954510"," Now that is what will happen."
"19955970","19958930"," There is a chase brought up CPI numbers tomorrow."
"19960090","19969310"," I guess there's a possibility that option three would be that the algos will wait for the CPI"
"19969310","19973110"," numbers in the morning, and then it would trigger a move higher or lower. "
"19973730","19978410"," But in general, we don't have any really, we don't have any bigger news than we have."
"19978630","19978910"," Here we go."
"19978910","19980030"," We're tagging right now. "
"19980690","19983670"," I showed you guys this what an hour ago, two hours ago."
"19984230","19985970"," Burr baby burr."
"19986410","19986890"," Burr. "
"19990180","19991400"," Make it go burr."
"19992800","19993980"," Spy just tapped."
"19994060","19995920"," I posted this chart earlier. "
"19998560","20007950"," 368.96. Bulls aren't waiting."
"20008810","20010050"," Bulls said hell no."
"20010450","20012890"," You guys can go back to Twitter right now, check where I posted that chart. "
"20013610","20015170"," I showed you the doubly red line."
"20015170","20019070"," You can see that we are directly on that line right now."
"20019610","20023310"," You're seeing some sellers enter in at the moment slight resistance. "
"20023470","20025750"," It's not showing on book map, but not truly."
"20026290","20030110"," This is why you use traditional charting patterns, right?"
"20030590","20035810"," So that you can see what chartists are using for their trades, what day traders are using."
"20037290","20040270"," And we literally to the pin, I'm going to post this right now. "
"20040830","20043550"," I'll repost this chart so that you can see it."
"20045340","20053040"," As a comparison, I'll do a side by side for you."
"20055020","20055960"," Wait a minute here. "
"20057340","20058320"," Hold on here."
"20062660","20065560"," I'm going to give you a side by side chart here."
"20066440","20068400"," This is how you trade. "
"20071650","20072730"," This is like day trade."
"20091900","20097000"," I'm going to give you a side by side comparison so you can see the trade as it unfolded."
"20097000","20104480"," And you can check both here. "
"20105880","20109620"," And you can now see the pink, the pink right off is 46896."
"20110440","20114780"," Just slightly below those two red lines, almost to the pin as they say."
"20130000","20138680"," And so now it's 252 and the question becomes, do we trade above into this 46963?"
"20139240","20140660"," I can show you guys some more numbers too. "
"20140660","20144020"," I'll show you guys some numbers above there in case you're uber bullish."
"20160090","20162590"," Let me see if I can get some better numbers here for you."
"20186200","20187080"," Or 714. "
"20199850","20208120"," Yeah, we could definitely see a ripper."
"20209080","20212660"," I'm going to post the rest of this for you guys right now on Twitter."
"20212660","20215500"," I want you guys to be aware of these zones and these levels. "
"20216200","20217620"," So this is the spy chart."
"20217840","20219940"," And then I'll post for you the..."
"20219940","20222560"," I'm going to show you the..."
"20222560","20229930"," I want you guys to see where we could possibly be headed."
"20231590","20234390"," Check out the Twitter, okay?"
"20235970","20237070"," So this is..."
"20237070","20238790"," I'm going to show you the spy in the first post. "
"20241650","20248150"," What would be the expectation heading into the overnight, even if we ricochet off and sell down?"
"20248590","20253730"," I'm going to show you the ES chart next for any futures traders."
"20259870","20262170"," The vol trigger was at 474."
"20280140","20282700"," It's basically this area right here. "
"20282700","20292580"," I do want you to realize that if we trade above this volatility"
"20292580","20299260"," zone, this volatility trigger, that you'll take on a bullish perspective."
"20300920","20302800"," That we're heading into..."
"20303480","20307240"," Right now, at this moment, we're heading into a bullish or a bearish."
"20307960","20310840"," Or are we starting to get bullish or are we starting to get..."
"20310840","20311960"," We're in this weird zone. "
"20312220","20313400"," It's not really negative and positive."
"20314100","20314980"," You're in like this."
"20315180","20319200"," If you're at a volatility trigger, above a volatility trigger is the start of being bullish. "
"20320040","20326240"," Below the volatility trigger is the start of being bearish or expecting volatility."
"20330140","20342850"," So I'll post both of these for you guys out here so you can see what's up as we"
"20342850","20343290"," move along."
"20345330","20350470"," And we're ripping much higher as anybody made money at this point. "
"20354920","20358460"," Yeah, you guys, positive gamma, 475."
"20360760","20362880"," You guys want to know where positive gamma is?"
"20363180","20364040"," No, it's less than that."
"20364700","20369660"," Positive gamma is 4726, if you want to know. "
"20371560","20374140"," If you guys ever have any questions like where's the gamma at?"
"20374280","20375240"," Where's the volatility at?"
"20376160","20377560"," I can give you guys exact numbers."
"20378580","20380420"," 4726 is positive gamma."
"20391940","20393480"," Waiting for the pullback that ever came. "
"20393620","20396060"," Yeah, it's hard to expect the pullbacks."
"20396660","20400340"," You have to take on your own risk and what your risk profile is out there."
"20400960","20403100"," We know that the bulls are in charge to an extent. "
"20405140","20411780"," We know that if we were trading down below the volatility trigger, the bears are in charge, even"
"20411780","20412360"," though we're volatile."
"20413080","20417820"," If we're trading up into the volatility zone of the volatility trigger, you know, the bulls are"
"20417820","20421380"," kind of in charge right now, that they're not going to give you a chance to buy the dip."
"20426210","20428430"," Yeah, we talked about buying the dip down here, right?"
"20430450","20431450"," You're welcome, Henry. "
"20431890","20433250"," Talked about buying the dip down here."
"20433310","20434290"," We're tempted to get back on."
"20437870","20440390"," I think I got back on at 120 this afternoon. "
"20442050","20447750"," We were at 467.89. We said, I don't care if it's an hour later."
"20447750","20450750"," We're getting up to 469, 470 into the close."
"20456600","20460840"," Your wife's boyfriend's panicking over there, and then it finally starts printing. "
"20465120","20465840"," Hilarious."
"20467720","20468440"," Hilarious."
"20473320","20475400"," I'd be up for 250%. "
"20475400","20476420"," You're welcome, everybody."
"20477560","20479600"," 172 people watching now."
"20479980","20481660"," Yeah, so that trade's over, right?"
"20482500","20484260"," So we made that beautiful trade. "
"20488380","20491920"," So that was a good trade."
"20492340","20498700"," Joe Harper called him when I called Joe Harper when calls were where they were what I said."
"20498860","20501360"," They were what 87 cents or something. "
"20502140","20508920"," I said expected $1.30 or $1.40. And I think they pinged one 40 at one point for a"
"20508920","20509440"," brief moment."
"20510240","20511140"," So there you go."
"20511580","20517480"," There's your 87 cents to $1.40. Watch your options, Shane's. "
"20518240","20519320"," Everybody pulled out."
"20519400","20528920"," They're now worth $1.27. Yeah, I know, Linky."
"20529300","20530320"," Linky knows what's up. "
"20535500","20536860"," Linky knows what's going on."
"20537380","20539120"," Some of you guys know what's up out there."
"20542120","20543280"," So we're going to put another. "
"20543440","20546620"," Now I'm going to put another support level on the spy here."
"20548620","20550200"," Then we're going to look for another dip by."
"20551700","20555940"," The next dip by is probably a 46831 if we even get that low. "
"20556900","20558380"," You could buy now and then add."
"20558740","20559140"," That's the thing."
"20559480","20561600"," Like you measure into your positions, right?"
"20561600","20563160"," I'm going to talk to you guys about you. "
"20563260","20563860"," Start your position."
"20566460","20567180"," Then you."
"20568780","20569540"," I know. "
"20569720","20570160"," Thanks, Dad."
"20571280","20573500"," So you're looking to buy the next dip, right?"
"20573620","20576720"," I'm going to show you guys a new chart for the next dip by opportunity for day trading."
"20579990","20580750"," Thanks, Dad. "
"20582870","20583890"," You guys are hilarious."
"20586150","20593130"," You can you can measure these trades in and then I'm going to post a new one to you guys."
"20597720","20599720"," Let's say we let's say right now we have. "
"20600000","20601520"," So we're coming into three o'clock hour, right?"
"20602420","20604240"," So you're going to look the best position, right?"
"20604900","20606460"," You got one, two, three."
"20606580","20607160"," I just posted it."
"20607560","20610780"," One, two, three, four, five places to buy. "
"20611680","20612140"," Take $100."
"20613160","20616060"," Spend $20 on buying right now."
"20616900","20621420"," If we dip down to 468, you take another $20 and you buy again. "
"20621420","20627260"," If we dip down to 467, 42, take your next $20 and you buy the dip again."
"20627860","20633560"," You buy down here at 466, 74, then 466, 93, 465, 93."
"20634480","20639360"," And you're going to average in to a rip into clothes. "
"20639900","20641500"," Now, does that mean we actually rip into clothes?"
"20641780","20651460"," No, but if that's your viewpoint, if you think we're going up from here into the end of the show"
"20651460","20655460"," and somewhere to tomorrow, then you take that position, right?"
"20655780","20660740"," And know that you can average into it so you get the best dollar cost average in your one-day"
"20660740","20662520"," calls, two-day calls or whatever."
"20663160","20665720"," So we rip higher into this clothes to 474, 71."
"20666180","20669400"," You're going to match that up to buyers and sellers on the heat map. "
"20670700","20673020"," Call buyers, call sellers, right?"
"20674920","20678100"," And the only thing that I would tell you is what I said yesterday, right?"
"20678100","20681540"," You ride this up in the clothes between 3 and 4pm."
"20682140","20688540"," You take profit right before the bell or between 15 minutes, depending on where we are, 15 minutes"
"20689060","20695740"," and 4pm so that you have all that interest built up and you don't dip a little bit after the"
"20695740","20695920"," bell."
"20696440","20697620"," You don't lose and count. "
"20698040","20707600"," If you're like, hey, we're still going up though into tomorrow, then you rebuy it for 15 or"
"20707600","20708060"," so."
"20709140","20711200"," So you can just kind of murder it all day long."
"20719270","20721490"," Now, what do we buy inside the money, inside the money?"
"20721690","20724070"," I try to look at the options chain and see where all the money is. "
"20724630","20727570"," The reason is because they trade so easily and fast."
"20728530","20732030"," Those calls, those 470 calls are $1.33 right now."
"20732390","20732630"," They're pricey. "
"20733810","20735050"," I want to see them come down a little bit."
"20735730","20742330"," I want to see them come down again to maybe $0.80. It wouldn't shock me to see a moment"
"20742330","20743650"," of dip."
"20744930","20746030"," Between now and 4pm. "
"20747450","20752010"," I bet if you rolled some dice right now out there, you'll see a brief dip."
"20753730","20760310"," The calls probably dip down to like $0.70, $0.80. Then you buy them again, maybe even $0.60."
"20766630","20768430"," So we'll wait and see for the next ride."
"20769610","20771210"," All right, so I'm going to stop talking. "
"20781150","20782470"," I'm going to stop talking now."
"20782470","20784410"," What we're going to do is we're going to wait for the next dip."
"20787150","20788910"," We'll ride this thing up into the close. "
"20802060","20804140"," Make sure you check Add Out Captain's Alpha."
"20804460","20806780"," I'll show you some levels to be buying dips at as well."
"21868340","21868920"," Yeah, Winky. "
"21870040","21871360"," It tagged to the pin."
"21871740","21876420"," The first time it made that first peak, it didn't tag the exact number."
"21877440","21880000"," And then it actually touched to the pin. "
"21880020","21880920"," You notice that, huh?"
"21880920","21883360"," It literally went to the pin."
"21884940","21887660"," I wasn't on right now, but I just got back on."
"21888160","21888760"," Winky noticed. "
"21889260","21897100"," So the first top didn't actually whack at 469.63, but then the second whack did."
"21897420","21899040"," And it's consolidating right now."
"21899760","21903740"," I wanted you guys to know out there that we are consolidating. "
"21904320","21905760"," It went to the pin."
"21906060","21906760"," Winky noticed."
"21908740","21913440"," So it pinned it at the 469.62, I think, not 63. "
"21914120","21915140"," I was off by one penny."
"21915920","21919760"," And now it's in this consolidating range right now into the close."
"21920180","21921940"," They could try to park it here into the close. "
"21922700","21923720"," I'm still looking."
"21924040","21930860"," I'm begging and hoping that we can get some kind of a dip to like 468.21. I'd be stoked"
"21930860","21931400"," with that."
"21931920","21932660"," See down here?"
"21933300","21934860"," See down in this 467. "
"21935580","21936140"," 468."
"21936620","21942860"," If we can get even a tag down below to 468 before the close, I'm begging for it to grab"
"21942860","21943600"," one more long."
"21943840","21946120"," We might not get it into this close right here. "
"21947840","21949840"," There is something that's weird."
"21949980","21955460"," You've got UVXY puts coming in alongside QQQ puts."
"21956200","21959140"," Lots of spy calls versus spy puts. "
"21959860","21961360"," There is an interesting trade here."
"21961360","21963760"," January 28, 42."
"21965180","21965960"," Sorry, hold on. "
"21967080","21969380"," 42 K web calls."
"21970300","21977360"," That's $1.42.42 calls for January 28, $500,000."
"21978140","21984700"," There's a mixed bag of spy calls and puts most of the flow coming in as bullish. "
"21986820","21995120"," My thought is that a day trader thinks that we're going to trade down for a dip to 468.28."
"21995760","22002620"," But the reality is this is what separates a lot of people is that you have to look at the"
"22002620","22008480"," direction that we're heading and where we're heading up."
"22008720","22012280"," So hopefully we can get down for a dip by."
"22013260","22019480"," I'm not talking about down here at 469.05. I'm talking more like we can get a dip down below"
"22019480","22023760"," here to like 468.26. I'm going to jump back in once more. "
"22023900","22024700"," Right now I'm not in anything."
"22024880","22029990"," I'm straight cashing and I'm waiting for one more dip by."
"22032180","22034620"," This is where the by the fucking dip crowd comes from, by the way. "
"22034800","22036960"," Day traders that know when to buy the dip and sell the rip."
"22038400","22040420"," But I don't know if we get down from here."
"22040420","22045500"," I think as we head into the close, we've got a buy program on right now into the close. "
"22046140","22048140"," We are coiling on the one minute chart."
"22048740","22050860"," I know you're not supposed to trade the one minute, but I am."
"22052970","22061370"," It is interesting to see where Tesla is right now because Tesla being where it's at right now into"
"22061370","22066310"," the close would support the idea that we trade up to 471 or so. "
"22066970","22068950"," I also looked at the."
"22069310","22073390"," I'm not going to bring it up right now, but if you guys have volume pro access to volume profile."
"22074610","22079510"," On my other computer, I'm looking at volume profile right now on the 15 minute tick. "
"22080830","22083950"," And it's the 15 minutes in the 10 day."
"22084650","22089870"," And it really does look like there's a good chance that we're trading above."
"22091330","22100050"," We're above an iceberg right now, and the next iceberg real resistance starts at 476 476 1."
"22100570","22101710"," Nothing's showing right now. "
"22101810","22107910"," We got a big B profile on today's volume profile."
"22108750","22110130"," It looks like a big B to me."
"22110230","22110650"," It could be wrong. "
"22110730","22111790"," It doesn't look D shaped."
"22112490","22118030"," It's looking like it's big B shaped at the moment, but it certainly looks like a leg up."
"22118830","22124250"," If you're just just look at the volume profile on a 15 minute 10 day, everything looks like we're"
"22124250","22124670"," going up. "
"22125050","22127930"," You know, you can't guarantee there's no guarantees this market."
"22128010","22133210"," I can't be the guy out there telling you, hey, we're going up and it's 100% guaranteed."
"22138530","22141030"," But you know, everything is looking like we're going up. "
"22142450","22143590"," That's what it looks like."
"22144130","22150110"," Now, I like cheap puts, but I always also have to look at the context of the market."
"22150930","22151370"," Right?"
"22151630","22153670"," When we trade to the right, we're trading up all the time. "
"22154090","22156070"," You're a bear 30% of the time."
"22156150","22157490"," You're a bull 30% of the time."
"22158470","22159710"," We had bad news. "
"22159930","22161350"," You have to look at what's in the docket for tomorrow."
"22162050","22165450"," We have CPI numbers that can be negative on the market tomorrow."
"22166830","22171990"," You can see down here at four, looking like 467 96. "
"22173770","22174870"," Let's see where I'm at."
"22175970","22179830"," Yeah, I'm at 468 24 if we were to sell down in the close."
"22182050","22184590"," You know that bulls are coming out, right?"
"22184790","22187350"," So when the bulls are coming out, they're expecting a move higher. "
"22188590","22191570"," You really, the real news is not the CPI numbers."
"22192110","22193210"," They might lend some volatility."
"22194330","22200350"," You can see we've got even firmer target above or call wall above it for 80 than we did this"
"22200350","22200790"," morning. "
"22203150","22205930"," Even in weakness, you're going to be looking to buy a dip right now."
"22212620","22215240"," You know, most trades don't pay just 100%."
"22215600","22216980"," So let's say I take this trade. "
"22217480","22221180"," I'm looking to pick up a dip by here before we get into the close."
"22222060","22225420"," Let's say I lose that trade on CPI numbers tomorrow morning."
"22226100","22232720"," I'm still going to buy the dip again unless they were off the charts and win again. "
"22232720","22237040"," So it really is a no lose situation at this point."
"22242970","22244450"," Give me one more quick reverse."
"22244690","22245950"," So I don't think I'm going to get it here, but. "
"22250860","22257180"," Yeah, and everybody is in on those and the premium on those calls, those 470 calls, even though we"
"22257180","22260200"," just dipped there up to $1.40. Right?"
"22260380","22261380"," They're 87 cents a ton."
"22261540","22266620"," They're now up to $1.40, even on the dip there up to $1.40. So they're going to print."
"22266900","22268700"," In my view, they're going to print. "
"22270440","22275380"," He's expired tomorrow on Wednesday and up to $1.50, $1.46, I mean."
"22278790","22280410"," So I don't know when you enter that trade."
"22280630","22285350"," We've been talking about the price of that call ad nauseam since one o'clock this afternoon. "
"22288050","22289810"," I don't know what else to say to you guys."
"22290050","22294930"," Let's say we got to $1.50, we trade down, let's say, and they have worth 80 cents again."
"22294930","22298930"," You've lost nothing and you can actually add to that position. "
"22299770","22300790"," So we're going up."
"22301690","22302950"," This is how you make money."
"22315460","22324620"," We're looking for a breakthrough 46998 or at least to the bell to 469.98. We'll bring this closer"
"22324620","22325780"," for you guys to see. "
"22330990","22335210"," 47207 right here and 46988."
"22337910","22338910"," So 46988."
"22339230","22341830"," It's not shocking to see us trade to 46988. "
"22350960","22353360"," So you got to mark that on your charts, right?"
"22353540","22355360"," I want you to mark down 46988."
"22357840","22359280"," We're trading up right now."
"22369620","22372140"," 46781, which is where my next target below is. "
"22372840","22376620"," We'll bring this on a more granular level so you guys can see what's up."
"22381600","22382440"," 4694, 46994."
"22392310","22393890"," And then you just look at your context. "
"22394870","22396110"," Are you bullish or are you bearish?"
"22396950","22399310"," Are you bullish and bearish in the year?"
"22399690","22400910"," Are you bullish and bearish in the month?"
"22400910","22402890"," Are you bullish and bearish in the week?"
"22403390","22404910"," Are you bullish and bearish in the day?"
"22405470","22407770"," Are you bullish and bearish into the clothes?"
"22408790","22410290"," What position are you in?"
"22410870","22412750"," The daily, the weekly, the monthly, the FD?"
"22414030","22414890"," That's all important."
"22420000","22421460"," Where are we going into the clothes?"
"22429270","22430590"," You guys are going to sing a song?"
"22431290","22435110"," The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire."
"22435110","22440150"," Yeah, the roof, the roof, the roof is on fire. "
"22450750","22451370"," Too funny."
"22456500","22458340"," That's about even Steven right now."
"22458920","22461420"," A little bit more buyers and sellers. "
"22462720","22464780"," Call buyings off the up in charts."
"22465760","22467360"," Off the charts right now."
"22469920","22476230"," The roof, the roof, the roof is on fire. "
"22476230","22478210"," Yeah, too funny."
"22484200","22488020"," Call buyers want to make a short squeeze."
"22509560","22513220"," You're going to get your short squeeze here in just a moment, I think. "
"22514040","22515440"," That's what it seems like it's happening."
"22522430","22523950"," I think you get it."
"22524410","22525190"," You might not get it. "
"22525690","22526150"," We're at resistance."
"22527330","22531230"," We're close within 20 cents of some resistance here."
"22532270","22533190"," You can see it above. "
"22533390","22536470"," It's at 469, 92."
"22536470","22538130"," We can bring it closer if you guys can see."
"22538270","22539510"," You guys want to see how close it is?"
"22542710","22545530"," You can see this red bar right here, how thick it is. "
"22546470","22549050"," You can see how thin this red bar is below."
"22550850","22554990"," We're above slightly on buyers down here, but on the second chart."
"22559550","22561930"," You can see this battle that's going on. "
"22568630","22570910"," If you're short, let me ask you the next question."
"22571170","22575590"," If you're short, this market, are you short into close?"
"22578610","22581990"," That's another thing that I ponder and think about where we are."
"22582370","22585350"," Like, would I feel confident short right now or long into the close?"
"22586570","22591070"," Let's say I was like, okay, I'm going to take a short position at 46971 right now at this moment. "
"22592510","22597550"," Would you personally take a short position right now where we are?"
"22600630","22606070"," Your next question is, who is short out there or has been short the past day or so that didn't"
"22606070","22606670"," close them out?"
"22607970","22611430"," Are they going to maintain that short position into the close?"
"22614210","22616490"," Sometimes they wait until the last five minutes."
"22617130","22625050"," You're like 3.45, 3.50, 3.55. They're sitting at a desk right now, a prop desk, and they're"
"22625050","22633930"," going, like the boss is downstairs doing his thing and the boss is like, Jimmy, are you short going"
"22633930","22634770"," into close today?"
"22634770","22637690"," And Jimmy's like, I don't want to tell him that I'm still shorting to have any money."
"22638830","22641890"," And Bob comes downstairs and he's like, Jimmy, are you shorting to close?"
"22642230","22643270"," Tell me you're not shorting to close. "
"22643630","22647010"," I told you to close him this morning at 9.30 or 10 o'clock."
"22648870","22650810"," And Jimmy's like, no, I'm still short."
"22651110","22656130"," I still believe that, of course, the boss is like, are you fucking crazy?"
"22657090","22659790"," Close those things up before the end of the day, right?"
"22665040","22669560"," So you got to wonder, are there any banks, any family offices, any short hedge funds right now?"
"22669560","22671900"," Are they going to stay short and to close today?"
"22672960","22673800"," I don't know. "
"22675240","22676880"," I think that risk is too high."
"22682400","22683640"," So I'm going to live trade with you."
"22683780","22687140"," If I can catch a catch a call right here, I will. "
"22687580","22688300"," Give me a minute here."
"22688380","22689000"," I'm going to look for one."
"22693700","22695580"," And I'll ride some calls into the open tomorrow. "
"22695820","22696420"," I think we're going up."
"22696540","22697920"," I think we're gapping up to be honest with you."
"22698480","22700340"," I think we're going to gap the fuck up to like four. "
"22700340","22702180"," Let's say we gap up no less."
"22703820","22704920"," No less than 470."
"22706520","22708700"," I think on the high side, we gap up to. "
"22712840","22714600"," Tell you what I think we're gapping up to tomorrow."
"22718280","22719440"," 471, 43."
"22720940","22721800"," Wouldn't shock me. "
"22723200","22724320"," 473, 73."
"22724960","22725800"," Wouldn't shock me at all."
"22730710","22732250"," If you think we're weak in the overnight. "
"22733870","22741050"," I guess the bare side of this trade would be that we trade higher, then trade lower into CPI"
"22741050","22741770"," numbers."
"22742890","22749110"," CPI numbers are so horrible that we do a third retest of the low at 462."
"22749590","22750730"," Maybe it's 450. "
"22751950","22757470"," Maybe it's what Mike said from MS. We have that one more percent left."
"22758010","22759050"," I think he said that yesterday."
"22759050","22763290"," He said he should see a dip for another 1%. "
"22765330","22768410"," Maybe that puts us down to 450, and then we make an actual run."
"22769670","22772730"," I guess I'm not trading my whole account in this trade."
"22772890","22780410"," I guess I could take the 1% drop into horrible CPI numbers tomorrow morning and pick up the R"
"22780410","22781850"," trade with 90% of my account. "
"22783150","22784030"," Tomorrow morning."
"22784290","22786010"," So I'm like looking at the cost benefit."
"22786010","22788770"," I've taken a 10% trade in the close today. "
"22789890","22791110"," I'll probably take that trade."
"22796480","22804080"," So even if CPI numbers are bad, I'll probably take that trade that we trade higher in Friday."
"22810600","22819680"," I guess option 3 would be that option 3 would be that we rip higher maybe into the tomorrow. "
"22820280","22822000"," And we trade sideways in the Friday."
"22823940","22827000"," We burn all the bears and we burn all the bulls."
"22827900","22830960"," And we don't see a rip higher into until next week. "
"22831640","22834320"," So you got like a bunch of call holders on 470 C."
"22834960","22836600"," 213,000 of them."
"22837880","22839440"," We haven't ripped higher yet."
"22839900","22841920"," So we know that they should still get paid. "
"22843480","22851680"," But if you want to see like 480 or 478 or 475, the 475 C is expiring on the 18th"
"22851680","22861680"," or only $1.3, $1.1. The January 19th, which is the Wednesday before you wouldn't want those."
"22861880","22865920"," You'd want the January 21st."
"22866860","22871160"," For 70 C's, there's 30,000 contracts out on that. "
"22871840","22873240"," They're $4 a piece."
"22874380","22880660"," So it seems like the bulls know that at some point on next Wednesday or Thursday, we're going to be"
"22880660","22881540"," way above 470."
"22882560","22883720"," Probably the safest bet. "
"22887790","22889310"," So give me that sell off in a close."
"22889590","22890230"," I can buy some calls."
"22892550","22894110"," Give me that dip by into the bell. "
"22898160","22899820"," We separate the men from the boys."
"22903480","22904120"," All right."
"22904220","22908960"," I'm going to go back to January 12th. "
"22909400","22915920"," I'm going to buy myself some 473 C's."
"22920270","22920610"," Let me see."
"22920710","22923030"," Let me look at the January 14th. "
"22924030","22925750"," 473 C's are really expensive."
"22928830","22929910"," January 12th."
"22931450","22934090"," Yeah, I'm going to go to 473. "
"22935690","22937650"," Where are those sellers at?"
"22938470","22940030"," There's some sellers up here at 470."
"22940910","22942110"," Let me see where the real sellers are."
"22952110","22954990"," 472 87 or 71. "
"22955190","22957470"," Clear skies above 474."
"22963630","22968350"," I'm going to probably look for a buy on 473 expiring."
"22969110","22973030"," Friday is the safer bet, but I'm trying to make some money here. "
"22973210","22981900"," So probably going to look for a buy on the bell."
"22983100","22985840"," We're at 35 cents on those calls right now."
"22990590","22995690"," I'm getting my dip buy down at a 468, 23 or so. "
"22999200","23002200"," We're going to lock in all those bulls and make them buy again."
"23005750","23007230"," I'm going to do this live with you."
"23007730","23014130"," If you are, if it was a half minute delay or whatever, I'm looking for two levels. "
"23014130","23017770"," I'm looking for probably going to scale in right now."
"23020580","23024220"," I'm going to do another buy at 468, 74."
"23024740","23026780"," Another buy at 468, 17. "
"23027560","23029400"," I'm going to buy some right now."
"23042030","23043310"," I'm on this 50."
"23051910","23059380"," Hang tight here. "
"23063110","23068430"," We've got 38 for hero indicators negative at the moment."
"23068950","23070650"," I'm just going to adjust the second here."
"23071790","23076350"," I'm looking at, oh, maybe we'll switch to 470s if they get cheaper. "
"23077410","23078710"," Yeah, so I'm going to clear this right now."
"23084760","23086120"," Hold on here a second."
"23088620","23089840"," I might buy the 47. "
"23090480","23092960"," Nope, I'm not going to give them that cheaper than that."
"23094200","23096460"," I'm going to look at 472s."
"23096920","23098600"," Wait, was that 473s?"
"23099440","23101520"," I'm going to look at 472s. "
"23109500","23110940"," I'm going to add some right now."
"23115780","23121820"," Let's see if I just grab some or not."
"23132560","23133700"," Yeah, I missed that trade. "
"23133980","23138170"," I was at 56 cents with that trade."
"23138170","23140270"," I'll add up to 59 cents."
"23141150","23141790"," Motherfucker. "
"23143150","23144170"," Give me 56."
"23145590","23146970"," Fill me at 56 cents."
"23148310","23149790"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"23150290","23151910"," Come on, fill me the rest of them."
"23161740","23164740"," I'm going to start filling here at 56 cents."
"23167560","23169500"," 57 cents up to now. "
"23172720","23175860"," If I can get it down to 30 cents to add more, I will."
"23185910","23188010"," These bastards aren't going to give me 56 cents."
"23188170","23189090"," Are they to fill all of it?"
"23191350","23192330"," God damn it. "
"23195580","23196300"," Come on."
"23203410","23204030"," I mean, that fill."
"23205950","23207470"," I got a partial fill. "
"23208690","23210410"," I'm not getting the fill that I want, though."
"23213550","23214890"," Trade down into the close."
"23238240","23239940"," I'm not going to get my trade down, am I?"
"23240580","23241820"," Did I get it all my fill or no?"
"23252480","23255040"," I like that 56 cents price range. "
"23255960","23258420"," I'd even take like 38 cents on 472s."
"23259180","23259600"," It would be dope."
"23260320","23260900"," That's great. "
"23261180","23261680"," A great fill."
"23262700","23265960"," I made it 56 cents, but not a ton."
"23268440","23273120"," And now we're up to 61 cents on that trade, 62 cents on that trade. "
"23278760","23279560"," I ain't moving."
"23279560","23280380"," I'm going to stick here."
"23280760","23285360"," I still have a buy order in, so I can catch some more of that trade, I will. "
"23293430","23295070"," I like the 472."
"23295490","23298770"," I like 470 is the safest for an overnight trade."
"23303820","23308400"," If you were taking an overnight FT trade, 470, even if we traded flat, you could get out of it"
"23308400","23313440"," and not get totally fucked up if CPI numbers are bad, or you get a slight dip. "
"23313940","23314520"," We trade sideways."
"23315560","23319500"," I like the idea of making 200 or 300% in the close."
"23325710","23326410"," Fill me out. "
"23326410","23333740"," And if we traded weight out into the bell, I'd just buy probably 1,000."
"23334460","23348530"," Oh, yeah,"
"23348630","23348770"," baby."
"23348950","23349310"," Give it to me. "
"23350010","23350870"," Give me a fill."
"23355660","23358960"," Yeah, I can't get a fill right now at the price I want."
"23360720","23363780"," Sometimes they'll slip in like for a brief second or two. "
"23364960","23365380"," I can throw."
"23367000","23376990"," I want to see like that brief"
"23376990","23377690"," moment like that."
"23377990","23378550"," I got 350. "
"23378590","23379750"," We sling down."
"23380030","23382890"," And the other way to fill this too is if you can't fill it now."
"23383570","23388250"," One guy's to remember that if you can't fill this now, that there's usually a moment that you can"
"23388250","23392490"," fill it after 4 p.m. Sometimes you can get it filled at the price you want. "
"23392890","23394290"," Sometimes I'll watch the spy."
"23396010","23397730"," Let's take a fill at 56 cents."
"23398190","23404030"," And if I see a dip down like the 38 cents mark, I'll add more to that fill for the"
"23404030","23406090"," open tomorrow because my conviction is we go up tomorrow. "
"23407510","23409470"," You know, that's my risk that I take on."
"23409810","23410950"," You guys think we're going down tomorrow?"
"23411070","23411390"," That's fine."
"23412050","23418470"," But for me, I think we go up and I really want to pay 38 cents for those calls. "
"23420830","23425550"," And if I have to get a full fill right now in case we ramp up into the bell, I'll"
"23425550","23426630"," pay the 56 cents."
"23426630","23431770"," But if we go down to like 38 cents at the bell, after the bell, then I'll pick more up"
"23431770","23432010"," then."
"23433350","23434750"," For me, this is a conviction play. "
"23435510","23436570"," This is not financial advice."
"23436650","23438490"," I don't think that you should ever follow me in my trades."
"23439470","23441410"," I think that you lose all your money if you do. "
"23444850","23447350"," Those calls are now up to 62 cents."
"23449670","23451130"," You take the money and run right there."
"23451890","23452530"," 63 cents. "
"23454810","23456570"," That's a 20% trade."
"23457710","23460850"," It's up 20% almost 18%."
"23466880","23467680"," 63 cents. "
"23476030","23479070"," Please give me a moment where we trade down a little bit so I can get it more fill."
"23479670","23480690"," I want more fill, baby."
"23481550","23482330"," Give me more fill. "
"23488830","23490510"," Still have a standing order out there."
"23491090","23492310"," Still waiting to pick it up."
"23495780","23500800"," If things got ugly when we trade it down, let's say to 4.68, I'd probably sell my calls and"
"23500800","23505400"," buy 4.70s. I get 4.70s like 70 cents, 80 cents. "
"23506500","23509020"," I'd easily roll them into 4.70. See for tomorrow."
"23512020","23513740"," That's the dynamics of the trade, right?"
"23521110","23521890"," Come on down."
"23522150","23523250"," Give me my fill, baby. "
"23533270","23539730"," Those 4.70s are at $1.32. If we sold off into the bell, you probably seem to get out"
"23539730","23540730"," of like 70 cents."
"23541790","23542370"," That'd be great."
"23542670","23545390"," Even if they went down to like 90 cents, that'd be great. "
"23561120","23569460"," Because you got contract holders that are probably in the 4.70s at like $1.30.40. You'd force those"
"23569460","23570620"," people to rebuy."
"23572340","23574200"," Give me the push over the edge that you want."
"23589830","23590610"," But wait a minute. "
"23601070","23602110"," Give me that fill, baby."
"23603330","23604330"," Give me that fill."
"23617480","23618240"," Here we go. "
"23618520","23618980"," Here we go."
"23619160","23620060"," Give me that fill, baby."
"23638330","23650700"," Okay, so I bought some 4.70s at $1.08. Oh,"
"23650760","23651600"," yeah, that was a great fill. "
"23653880","23655380"," That was an outstanding fill."
"23657860","23663500"," I just tagged 4.70s for $1.08. That's a banging fill."
"23665100","23666560"," Thank you very much for playing. "
"23672780","23678000"," I got a small boat on 4.72 at 56 cents."
"23678220","23679980"," They're upside down right now by 4 cents."
"23683060","23688700"," I bought 4.70s at $1.08. Those are up right now, a bunch. "
"23695940","23703300"," If I can grab more 4.70s, if we tag 4.6820, I'll buy more."
"23706180","23713110"," It's 3.51. It's discount shopping time."
"23717340","23719960"," Thank you for whatever hedge fund did that real quick. "
"23720580","23722440"," For a good buy and I appreciate it."
"23725340","23730300"," 4.6874 is the mark that I gave you for the first dip over the year."
"23731900","23733920"," There's some green barage over that right now. "
"23734640","23735240"," It's a great buy."
"23736060","23745300"," $1.08 on 4.70s. If I can get them cheaper at the bell or after the bell buy them."
"23745300","23747880"," It's starting at 4.72, but the sell down. "
"23751600","23752380"," Let's see."
"23753920","23762800"," Yeah, someone else out there buying spy calls to 4.71s. Yeah, 4.71 is a big buy right now,"
"23762860","23773460"," 4.71c. So they're splitting the difference on 4.70 and 4.72. It's"
"23773460","23774220"," actually a sweet buy."
"23775460","23782740"," You also want to consider if they're going to print them if there's a possibility that we go to 4 "
"23782740","23787500",".72. You want to buy too far outside the money because they won't pay them. "
"23789760","23793720"," If the market doesn't think we're going to hit 4.73 or 4 or whatever."
"23794260","23795500"," It might not print until the end of the day."
"23804790","23812010"," We're at 1.08 again briefly on 4.70c. We're back up to 1.12 right now. "
"23816600","23819040"," So I'll wait for my next buy in for the bell."
"23819860","23824280"," And I can dollar cost average calls just in case we trade down into the bell."
"23831550","23836490"," If we have that moment, sometimes you get that moment where you get a big red bar right at the"
"23836490","23836890"," buzzer. "
"23837370","23842210"," And if we do get that red bar, I will add another 5 racks or so."
"23844910","23851630"," Right now I'm in 4.70c. I'm in 4.72c. The 4.70 is a printing."
"23851950","23855910"," The 4.72s are three pennies below what I paid for them. "
"23868530","23871290"," Yeah, I wouldn't have those buyers on that 4.71 right now."
"23873350","23875590"," The 4.71 has lots of buyers on it."
"23875670","23876110"," I don't know why. "
"23876250","23878570"," There wasn't a lot of buyers on 4.71, but there's a ton."
"23880130","23887590"," That little dump there at the end reminds me of a bigger bank or a short covering that wants to"
"23887590","23888630"," take this long into tomorrow."
"23890750","23892590"," Just dollar cost average of calls. "
"23892850","23897970"," If you're bullish on tomorrow, maybe some of the futures guys can tell us as we head into the."
"23898270","23903430"," So if you're a futures trader, do you think that we sell futures or do you think we buy futures?"
"23905250","23906470"," That's a big question, right?"
"23906670","23908730"," Hello, ladies, print it, baby."
"23911150","23912290"," Giant green bars. "
"23919540","23921820"," Yeah, my shit's printing heavy right now."
"23923320","23926980"," My shit's printing fat and we're not even in the clothes right now."
"23927400","23930960"," My shit's printing right now. "
"23931360","23931900"," Whoa."
"23933340","23936860"," I'm making a lot of money right now."
"23936860","23939700"," I could close these out right now and take some money and run. "
"23943990","23944390"," Hilarious."
"23944950","23946770"," Thank you for the giant green bars in the clothes."
"23954500","23955300"," Crazy town. "
"23982180","24009470"," Yeah, if you just guys say the buy program was turned on around 2 p.m. Yeah,"
"24009570","24010490"," some in calls right now."
"24010610","24011330"," They're printing heavy."
"24011950","24014650"," So they're already that dip by right there is printing. "
"24016130","24018810"," It's pretty effing well right now."
"24020030","24020790"," In the clothes."
"24036670","24039230"," I'm going to load up on some more four seventies here. "
"24046950","24049030"," I think we I think we got higher tomorrow."
"24049770","24053190"," It's not a guaranteed thing, but you got to you got to look at what's happening."
"24054010","24054990"," We're looking higher. "
"24055210","24060090"," So in my view, futures is going to want to bring us up to just check above and see what's"
"24060090","24060210"," up."
"24065800","24070320"," That that trade that I talked to you guys about is printing heavy."
"24082540","24093220"," It's at $1.39 now is at $1.08 now it's at $1.40 $1.41. That's"
"24093220","24095420"," like a 35% win in 15 minutes. "
"24096620","24098240"," That was a live trade with you guys, right?"
"24099160","24100480"," So I don't know what else to say to you guys."
"24102820","24104540"," What I'm ready to say to you guys."
"24113950","24115490"," Nice fat print into clothes. "
"24116210","24119550"," Not a huge print, but it's going to print fat into the bell."
"24119790","24123750"," If you guys ever want to get out of your calls at the bell, wait for a 3.59 or"
"24123750","24124050"," so."
"24124450","24129670"," You see the big green bars going up right now right into the clothes and you can take the money"
"24129670","24130450"," and run right here. "
"24146670","24152050"," I don't know how you guys trade out there, but I think we hit $1.08 twice."
"24152330","24156850"," So you had a second opportunity to buy him at $1.08, even if we even with the delay."
"24158850","24163030"," And look at this burr right into the clothes. "
"24163230","24164810"," Look at this giant ass green bar."
"24165590","24166630"," Burr, give it to me."

"24324700","24325760"," They were at sixty three cents. "
"24326140","24327440"," They went down as far as fifty."
"24327580","24328420"," You could have rolled into those."

"24351760","24354980"," The futures traders out there, they know how these trades go."
"24355540","24361880"," Futures traders trade a little bit more safely because they're buying contracts of actual shares in"
