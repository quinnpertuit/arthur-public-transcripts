"70680","72080"," Check one, two, check."
"74700","75980"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"78740","79860"," Mike is hot. "
"89120","91220"," What do you got going on here?"
"93820","94880"," Good morning, everybody."
"95140","95940"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"97380","98920"," Got the hair down this morning."
"100400","101380"," Got it flowing, baby. "
"102000","104080"," Flowing, flowing for pow."
"106900","108000"," Big day today."
"118210","119570"," Yep, hold on. "
"122050","125250"," All right here."
"129800","130640"," All right."
"131840","132600"," Here we go. "
"132720","132960"," Good morning."
"133680","134860"," Hold on, say let me check something out here."
"139980","141840"," Okay, hold on here. "
"143720","145700"," All kinds of stuff to do this morning."
"147080","147920"," We'll get into it."
"148020","149320"," We'll just get right into it right now. "
"149880","151020"," I just need a moment here."
"151180","151820"," I'm a little behind."
"157480","163940"," Some technical stuff I have to do to start the day that YouTube is being kind of wonky right now"
"163940","164500"," in the background. "
"168430","169470"," All right."
"169670","169950"," It's weird."
"170130","179710"," My thumbnail this morning was my thumbnail this morning was flagged for"
"179710","183650"," review, which is kind of funny. "
"183730","184970"," It says it's not for children."
"186590","193390"," So I'm like, okay, subscribers, any duration, save."
"195270","196230"," Well, that's fine. "
"196930","198050"," Whatever they want to do."
"201050","204520"," Kind of wonky."
"205640","211020"," I wonder if it's like an algorithm or something that picked that up. "
"214960","219260"," Okay, so this morning, we're trading up on the open this morning."
"221640","228980"," Typical not not assuming that some of you guys out there closed your puts on the bell this morning."
"230180","232220"," That you did not hold. "
"233660","236420"," We're going to chart this out to start the morning."
"236420","237840"," And then that way."
"241070","241910"," Let me see here. "
"246300","248060"," I'll put up a book map for you."
"258970","260350"," Let the morning open up."
"260570","262090"," I'm going to chart this with you this morning. "
"262370","264450"," I was going to chart it and then come into the live stream."
"264750","271310"," But some days I like to do it with you so you can see how I go about my mornings,"
"271310","271890"," my day."
"272830","274610"," So some mornings I'll chart it with you. "
"275310","277870"," I'll put the pivots in on live stream."
"277870","280450"," So just for today, let the market open up right now."
"281210","282410"," We'll do that together. "
"284350","289750"," And before we even do that, we're going to review what we had done yesterday."
"291270","292750"," How we had set up for today."
"294490","296250"," So we'll look at SPX real quick. "
"299730","301870"," I think we might be able to get in some."
"302030","303890"," You guys already know about the one minute chart."
"304070","305070"," You don't need me to tell you this. "
"305570","307130"," You can trade right off typically."
"307830","309150"," You're looking for a set up here."
"309890","312090"," This blue line is underneath the green line. "
"312430","313610"," I don't never like to see that."
"313650","315030"," I always like to blue over the green."
"315970","317670"," So I want to see this happen here. "
"318450","320550"," If you're looking for a target above remaining."
"321530","326390"," Just quickly, I'll give you a quick target above and that would be we already tagged the overnight"
"326390","327270"," highs here."
"327850","331350"," We have an overnight low, hiding down below it for 04. "
"336480","338560"," Put those in there for you so you can see them."
"338940","344060"," You can see this overnight low right here for 04.40. Clean up some of these gaps."
"346540","348440"," Look above and see what we find there. "
"348860","350180"," There's another one right above here."
"353600","355220"," We're going to call it a new high."
"355440","360560"," We're going to try to probably try to get rid of this one here from yesterday. "
"362000","363500"," Get rid of this one right here."
"364340","365580"," This is these two right here."
"367360","368340"," 10 seconds. "
"370000","371400"," We're going to look at SPX."
"371860","373540"," I was charted this on SPX yesterday."
"374720","379400"," We're going to basically use the charting from SPX yesterday and just review. "
"380560","390080"," 946.9 higher than the forecast of 46.8. SPX right here."
"390320","395060"," This really is what I'm looking for this morning."
"396860","398960"," I'm a bull whether you know that or not. "
"399040","399640"," I am a bull."
"401660","403580"," We just want to look here in SPX."
"405140","407020"," We've spent a lot of time in here, right?"
"409520","411080"," I've had some demand here. "
"411400","413860"," Actually, I don't know if it makes any bigger or not."
"418540","420360"," Bears want down here, right?"
"420760","421860"," 3,200 I guess."
"423360","424020"," That's fine. "
"424600","425780"," We've got some gaps down here to close."
"426100","426740"," We actually have some gaps."
"427980","430260"," If you go back in time, it's somewhere down in here. "
"432700","436340"," But you can see back in October, the market was bought, right?"
"436620","437960"," We know the market was bought back here."
"438460","439160"," We know it was also."
"439360","440300"," We changed the color. "
"443010","445010"," Notice where demand is right down below."
"446750","450930"," We're talking on 10 to it about, you know, or yesterday I was with some friends and I was like,"
"451030","451590"," you know, they bought it."
"451710","452110"," They bought it. "
"452330","454250"," This is all by the dip, right?"
"454430","456310"," By the dip, by the dip, by the dip."
"456310","459970"," By the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the dip, by the"
"459970","460130"," dip."
"462030","463830"," Just consistent buying the dip. "
"464050","468050"," We also know Mike Wilson came out and kind of put a synthetic put on the market."
"469010","471970"," So this is the last leg of the bear market for now."
"474430","476450"," So how far can you chase the hole?"
"476770","477110"," I don't know. "
"478230","481410"," The other thing we know is that JPM color."
"482510","486490"," We're going to go over the JPM color once again today because I saw a lot of discussion about"
"486490","487410"," hedging in the market."
"488490","492950"," You know, I'll go over the JPM color once more time this morning because I still don't think"
"492950","495710"," everyone firmly graphs what it what graphs what it means. "
"497490","498950"," And it's impact on the market."
"499970","503390"," But we know that we know that we have by the dippers, right?"
"503570","506310"," We know we have known demand currently right here."
"507130","508170"," This is 376. "
"508750","511570"," This is 385 or so."
"511809","515789"," I'm going to go over some of them coming up in the past couple of decades."
"515789","519850"," Up in here or past decade and then the final fucking two years. "
"521070","523330"," Better need here trying to propel us forward."
"523430","528290"," We hired the US S&P manufacturing PMI final full report on the feed for all those interested."
"529290","531110"," So we'll go over that this morning as well. "
"533470","534970"," So you want to see this hold."
"535130","535590"," If you're a bull."
"536370","537910"," Well, you want to see this hold today. "
"538390","539870"," Same thing going on here."
"540050","540890"," The data we received."
"542110","543790"," Fools in output and new orders soften. "
"543790","545290"," None of this stuff matters."
"545310","546650"," None of this new squawk matters."
"547290","548850"," It's been a lot of time in here, right?"
"549210","553270"," Buying here, buying here, buying here, buying here. "
"553870","555550"," This is going to come into play later."
"555690","556790"," This is 397396."
"558110","565810"," This is basically the line that bulls need to hold today to continue higher today tomorrow this"
"565810","566070"," week. "
"569550","571450"," We start blasting down here."
"574110","575550"," Different story, right?"
"575690","578130"," This kind of looks like let's go see 360 down below."
"580510","583510"," Truthfully, this is where DPM wants to see us. "
"584010","592010"," DPM, to be honest with you, most prime banks want stability in the market."
"592190","594810"," They want to kill volatility on the upside and downside."
"595690","596790"," They don't want real price discovery. "
"597250","598530"," They don't want to be going."
"598530","605510"," If I'm a big bank and I'm trying to package a fund for you, your 401k for, let's say, let's"
"605510","607290"," say you own, I don't know, general motors."
"608710","609870"," You want to package a 401k?"
"610470","612070"," They want consistent returns over time. "
"612790","619550"," They want to come out and say, over the last 10 years, we averaged 15% profit for a 401k."
"620270","627530"," One year we made 12%, one year we made 13%, another year we made 17%, another year we made 20%."
"628450","636330"," Part of the structure of these funds is they try to limit downside and upside. "
"637130","638690"," They like moves like this."
"641270","647670"," And truly these hedge funds, how they hedge themselves is they limit the upside move and they try"
"647670","648810"," to limit the downside move."
"648810","656990"," And they really like to see the first part of that hedging trade to print so they can hedge the"
"656990","660990"," downside so that they do have a bad month. "
"662270","665170"," They can at least say, don't worry about it though because the market fell."
"666490","668810"," We hedged it and you're going to get to 12%."
"670330","675590"," And if we actually go up in volatility, right outside of expected range for one of these prime"
"675590","677290"," banks, all the better. "
"677290","678470"," They make more money."
"679950","683770"," The put side is free, the hedge is free, hedge is free, right?"
"688520","689900"," Now, can we go up from here?"
"690200","698040"," This is where JPM say, JPM truly in a real world would like to see the range somewhere in here."
"698200","699840"," We trade down here, right?"
"701720","703840"," It's a higher low, right?"
"704680","709840"," And then they hopefully they come out with another hedge next quarter and we're slightly higher,"
"710080","710100"," right?"
"710300","713740"," 420 maybe, doesn't make a bank happy, right?"
"714920","716500"," Slowly going up over time. "
"717400","721280"," And to be honest with you, if you're a trainer, would you really want real price discovery?"
"722160","725980"," You could see Tesla at like $50,000 a share."
"727240","732120"," Now you're limiting people buying it and then you could see Tesla crash down to 60 bucks."
"732120","738260"," So there is a function from these prime banks that try to stabilize our market. "
"739020","748840"," There is an actual function that tries to stop or tame some of the price discovery that takes"
"748840","749720"," place in our markets."
"750480","753680"," Our markets, they posted last night and said our markets would be a shit show if we didn't have"
"753680","754040"," hedging."
"754500","754780"," And they would. "
"755420","756760"," It'd be a fucking disaster."
"757140","757460"," It'd be a nightmare."
"760960","762400"," So can we go up from here?"
"762560","762780"," Yes. "
"763040","769380"," If we do go up from here, it's usually a slow grind higher, even if we expand higher."
"769840","772660"," What you need is a bunch of hedging to come out, right?"
"772860","775420"," Then you need a bunch of outside of them and a call behind that kind of stuff."
"778150","779070"," Need a bunch of panic. "
"781230","782410"," Then we're going to crash, right?"
"783710","785030"," Press the grind higher here."
"787510","789310"," Some unknown news, that kind of stuff."
"789530","793590"," So just be aware of that as we go higher. "
"793830","795810"," Now, this is the bookcase."
"795950","798810"," I'm going to show you another chart why that is or what, what, why this matters."
"799090","800130"," The screen line matters here. "
"800210","801790"," I'm going to show it to you right now why this matters."
"803050","803370"," This morning."
"807220","808140"," Give me a second here. "
"815670","817150"," You need to be aware of this stuff."
"818150","821470"," I want you to fully be aware of this stuff from why it matters."
"827800","829120"," These aren't moving averages. "
"829340","830260"," I keep getting asked that."
"830480","833300"," Now, buddy of mine, James Rowland."
"834280","838280"," I used to ask him that same question constantly that they're not. "
"842780","845060"," These are velocity fractals, if you want to know."
"845320","853850"," So anyways, these lines here are coming up."
"854030","856150"," There's a daily here, a weekly and a monthly. "
"858470","860150"," And they're pushing up from underneath."
"860150","862070"," This is a one minute chart."
"863450","869070"," You can see currently it's at 396.07. 394 11. "
"872130","874710"," Now, that's about where this is right here."
"874930","876250"," Right where this green bar is, okay?"
"876770","877830"," We don't want to break below this."
"878610","881950"," Trust me, bears would love to break below this. "
"882430","888310"," Now, historically in time, if we break below this and hold under this."
"889730","892490"," It can lead some real heavy downside action."
"892750","895010"," That's where you get like your 3,200 and stuff like that. "
"897730","899230"," Not your 3,600, right?"
"899510","902670"," You want to see like a bounce at 3,600, come back up."
"903410","905490"," But if we start heading under 3,600."
"907190","909150"," Start rejecting here and heading lower. "
"909670","912710"," The bears really want to break this today and hold it."
"915010","917510"," This is like a first big step for bears."
"918770","923090"," I'm going to show you why you need to understand this right now. "
"927670","928650"," Why it matters."
"931830","936110"," You can get rid of some of this stuff here so you can see this."
"939830","944270"," I'm going to try to bring this up on a day started. "
"947160","948780"," I'm going to show you why this matters."
"954260","955440"," People tell you this doesn't matter."
"958960","961940"," You want to see this orange line right here. "
"963180","965120"," Start to pull away from the blue line."
"967900","969760"," You want to see this over time, right?"
"969920","971080"," This orange line come up here."
"971920","975940"," You want to see the blue line start to come up here. "
"976620","981900"," You want to see price begin to separate itself from these two lines."
"982200","982960"," There's a reason for this."
"983060","984120"," I'm going to show you why here in a minute. "
"984200","985080"," I want you to remember this, okay?"
"985680","986700"," Why you're looking to see this?"
"987240","989560"," Why this is important currently where we are."
"991120","995840"," And, you know, we don't have confirmation yet, but I want to show you right now why this matters to"
"995840","997340"," you as an investor trader."
"999440","1001440"," And time as time passes. "
"1001740","1003560"," You see this orange line coming up, right?"
"1004160","1007880"," You want to see this blue line coming down, this orange line coming up, and this is a historical"
"1007880","1008720"," reason for this."
"1009100","1010960"," You all talk about how lines don't matter."
"1011220","1012360"," They do matter, right?"
"1013780","1016560"," I'm sorry, I'm saying orange line go under the blue line go up. "
"1016680","1018360"," I'm not having a miss- I'm miss- speaking right here."
"1018760","1021740"," You want to see the blue line come up, I'm saying orange line come up."
"1021840","1025880"," You want to see the blue line come up, price stay above the blue line, and the orange line go"
"1025880","1026060"," below. "
"1026760","1032180"," It's kind of important for you as a bull, because you can see that we trade above this blue line"
"1032180","1033880"," for extended periods of time."
"1035500","1039839"," Now, when we've broken this orange line down here in previous examples, it's been very quick."
"1040560","1046060"," So if you are along the stock market, historically, you tend to hold. "
"1046700","1048040"," There are many examples of it."
"1048160","1050700"," This is like a month drop here, month drop here."
"1050820","1051920"," This is what the bears talk about. "
"1052560","1053720"," Well, that last leg down."
"1053900","1056760"," It's what Mike Wilson to an extent is talking about."
"1057460","1059720"," Last leg down, last leg down, right?"
"1060900","1063160"," I want to show you some other examples though here. "
"1064700","1069900"," When you see this 2008, you see the blue line come down below, right?"
"1070480","1072880"," You see the blue line come down below here, right?"
"1074140","1075640"," Different instances, right?"
"1075860","1077020"," This is a different time, right?"
"1077200","1078180"," Blue line comes down below."
"1081100","1084940"," Notice how the blue line doesn't come down below here, the blue line doesn't come down below here,"
"1084940","1085180"," right?"
"1085420","1090720"," Important differences in 2008 to other capitulation moments."
"1092620","1100400"," So I guess I said I'll come back to a closer representation of this, telling you you want to see"
"1100400","1103520"," the orange line stay below, but you actually want to see the blue line. "
"1104500","1106140"," So you want to see this separation."
"1106160","1108440"," You can see this separation already taking place here."
"1108880","1110680"," You already see the separation taking place. "
"1111400","1112960"," Price is starting to push away."
"1115640","1117020"," Pretty significant, right?"
"1120320","1125780"," That price is starting to push itself away from these fractals that are coming up."
"1126680","1129920"," And we want to maintain this, okay?"
"1130120","1135560"," So we're already right now at 406.13, and these fractals are down around 396. "
"1136900","1142380"," So you got 40.60, but you have a 100 point separation currently."
"1142760","1144360"," And the market needs to do this."
"1144620","1146400"," If you're a bull, the market needs to do this. "
"1146820","1148740"," You want to see the separation from that blue line."
"1148780","1151140"," You want to see the orange line push away."
"1154130","1155070"," I was mixed with this. "
"1155130","1156770"," I really want to see the orange line coming over here."
"1157110","1158870"," You want to see the blue line start to separate."
"1158890","1159650"," You want to see volatility. "
"1161410","1164130"," And you want to see price, even if we come down here and bounce."
"1164850","1166670"," So you go up here and we bounce down here."
"1166690","1168330"," You want to start to see in this kind of a move. "
"1169430","1171190"," And you want to see, you want to see this separation."
"1171450","1175610"," If you can see this for the next one to three years, you'll start to see volatility in the market"
"1175610","1176310"," kind of decrease."
"1179050","1184870"," And if we bounce down here and rip back up here, if the dip is bought, we're good to go. "
"1185170","1190330"," If we blast down to 360 and then bounce back up, that might be your capitulation phase."
"1190530","1191150"," That's a check mark."
"1191730","1194630"," We blast down to 3,200 and swing straight back up. "
"1195530","1197110"," That's that Mike Wilson trade, right?"
"1197470","1200190"," You might just want to hold and not sell, not capitulate sell."
"1200710","1205170"," And if anything, you should be starting to think about some kind of a plan here."
"1205170","1208990"," If you're not just a day trader, you want to start thinking about a plan here. "
"1210230","1217030"," And start changing to some extent for a year, nine months, three years."
"1218250","1220350"," Start thinking about a bottom down here."
"1221770","1226630"," If you like to buy the market, if you're like, hey, I'm going to think about buying a market down"
"1226630","1226850"," here. "
"1227710","1229750"," These are some DCAs I'm going to do."
"1230450","1234570"," If we never get down here, at least I bought over here, I bought over here."
"1234570","1237970"," But if we come down here, I can keep DCA and start moving your way up. "
"1238850","1240210"," Do I believe in a market crash?"
"1240610","1241750"," No, not right now."
"1242590","1244210"," We'll deal with that when we get down there."
"1244310","1245810"," I think it's later one to three years. "
"1245850","1247130"," You want to have a real true bottom?"
"1247570","1248910"," Probably one to three years from now."
"1249670","1254110"," But if you want a tradable investable bottom for the next one to nine months, maybe to a year to"
"1254110","1258650"," three years, it's probably going to happen real soon here."
"1260330","1263450"," And this is all due to time, right?"
"1263450","1267970"," You gave the Fed time to do its thing. "
"1270810","1273510"," If this orange line was way down here, I'd say, oh, hell no."
"1274770","1276270"," We're coming down here now, right?"
"1276710","1282610"," But we've spent two years selling this market."
"1283190","1283850"," Two years. "
"1286750","1292210"," So if we crash today down to 320, I'm not as concerned."
"1292210","1293550"," I think it's a quick recovery."
"1293970","1295250"," It's probably a month here. "
"1296210","1301750"," So I would be, like Mike Wilson says, start to change your stance."
"1302970","1306090"," He's also put a Fed put in his own way."
"1306210","1310130"," He said, last leg of the bear market, that means you can't short the whole. "
"1310390","1313050"," That means we're not going down to fucking 1400 right now, 2400."
"1314670","1318830"," So he's like synthetically created buyers."
"1318830","1323190"," He's told people to step in to buy whatever this low is. "
"1323330","1329070"," If we even get it, he's created demand in the market that we didn't have."
"1329070","1334170"," He's changing sentiment by the note that he released earlier this week."
"1338460","1341040"," So that's my, at least that's how I think about this right now. "
"1343500","1347000"," So for you, we know about this 396 19."
"1348060","1354060"," We know if we break this, we know if we break this, it's bad."
"1357190","1361890"," But, you know, if we start trading up here, you know, we start putting some separation in. "
"1362530","1364230"," Start to see this stuff coming down."
"1365390","1367910"," Doesn't, doesn't make so much bad sense, does it?"
"1368070","1369570"," Trading sideways and up to the right."
"1371110","1375150"," As we've said before, they're going to wait for that last or we've said before. "
"1375530","1379310"," You know, if you, if you don't look at this chart over here, but this right here."
"1380490","1382590"," Well, this chart looks a lot different, doesn't it?"
"1382950","1383350"," Trading sideways."
"1384690","1386050"," Looking for dips to buy. "
"1386730","1388210"," Looking to sell tops up here."
"1389970","1391250"," Right, slow grind higher."
"1392750","1394330"," This is what it's been trading like. "
"1394410","1396570"," It's been trading like this since, since May, June."
"1397270","1404810"," So, meanwhile, we're all talking on social media about market crashes and all kinds of nonsense."
"1405870","1406890"," They've been trading it sideways. "
"1409210","1410950"," For seven months, eight months."
"1412010","1414990"," We're all down here trying to sell everything."
"1415550","1418130"," Meanwhile, they're just trading this up and down to the right and up. "
"1421390","1423990"," So, I'd be, this is where the money is."
"1425810","1428510"," Not down below and not at all time highs."
"1433010","1437830"," So, what we'll do is we'll, we'll talk, we'll start to snap these in this, this morning for this"
"1437830","1438090"," afternoon. "
"1439550","1446870"," We'll look at the spy and we're going to go to, I guess we'll go to one hour chart."
"1454030","1455070"," Exciter, give me a second."
"1460860","1462520"," The 396 this, right?"
"1463380","1464460"," Way down here. "
"1464580","1466160"," Look at how far down this is."
"1471100","1472840"," Bulls only need this right here."
"1474220","1475580"," That's all they need today. "
"1477040","1477740"," Hold this."
"1480000","1480460"," Right?"
"1480900","1481760"," That's all they need to."
"1481900","1482840"," It's all, all a bull needs. "
"1486420","1487940"," That's all they got to hold right there."
"1488020","1491900"," I'm going to put some, I'll put your resistance and supports in for a second, but you want to focus"
"1491900","1492780"," on this one right here."
"1493960","1499140"," Next one is a 385 to 375ish somewhere in there. "
"1500440","1502280"," And you can see what that one is down here."
"1502500","1503640"," Look at how far down it is."
"1509060","1510040"," Somewhere down in here. "
"1510160","1510680"," They got to hold this."
"1517580","1518880"," That still keeps them bullish."
"1520020","1525410"," It shows you how bullish this move is right now, right?"
"1530950","1532590"," And the bulls want some separation. "
"1533090","1536970"," So they want to be getting above the zone right here."
"1537070","1538130"," They want to get above this stuff."
"1538250","1540050"," This is what the bears need to hold this, right?"
"1540850","1541770"," That bear thesis. "
"1542610","1544790"," Even if it's only in the short term, right?"
"1549170","1552710"," You're going to be watching today to see what the reaction is, right?"
"1552890","1553250"," Do we bounce?"
"1554490","1558110"," Do we break through and hold over here and start making our way lower?"
"1558770","1558810"," Right?"
"1558970","1562850"," Do we slap this and not break through this kind of like where you take your profit and jump back"
"1562850","1563110"," in?"
"1564490","1564930"," Right?"
"1565570","1567110"," This is where the money is right here."
"1567690","1568990"," This is where the money is right here."
"1570510","1572630"," Does it get underneath and keep trading lower?"
"1573290","1575410"," Does it bounce and come back up, right?"
"1575990","1577030"," So bears have a ton of work. "
"1577250","1581290"," They got to, you know, this is the only trade for a bear."
"1582030","1584090"," And then this is the only trade for a bear."
"1584690","1589090"," And then if the bears want to take on the next trade, it's somewhere down in here, right?"
"1590910","1593190"," This is where the JPM collar is down here. "
"1594890","1597130"," This is the meat of the trade down here for bears."
"1600290","1602110"," There's a whole nother trade down here."
"1606840","1610500"," And this is only if you reject here, we start making our way lower, right?"
"1610840","1613740"," You might reject and bounce out, close this gap, then come down here. "
"1614760","1616580"," But that's basically what the bears are looking for."
"1617520","1618120"," Right there."
"1618260","1619440"," That's what they're looking for, right there. "
"1619960","1620820"," Bam, bam, bam."
"1621680","1623880"," You want to start talking about 3,200 below here?"
"1625660","1628940"," Sorry, 3060 on the JPM, the other side of the JPM collar."
"1629500","1630760"," You got more work to do down here. "
"1633970","1635050"," Bulls could care less."
"1637450","1642310"," Bulls could, we can blast up north here today, come back down here, right?"
"1643090","1644350"," It's just start doing this nonsense."
"1645590","1648630"," Bulls could care less in terms of 360. "
"1655140","1658580"," Bulls could come up here and come back down here and start trading it back up again."
"1659780","1660760"," And we've got a higher low."
"1662400","1666900"," Everybody's happy in the springtime, come back in the summer, slam it back down in July or"
"1666900","1667280"," something. "
"1668560","1673040"," So, you know, the ball is not in the, or the ball is just in the bear court."
"1675220","1677640"," The bears have so much work to do."
"1677900","1682640"," This is, this is pretty much, you know, what is a, what is a bull care?"
"1684820","1685860"," This is all on the bears. "
"1689840","1690980"," All the bulls have to do here."
"1691840","1694200"," We know we're, we know we're high right now."
"1694900","1697280"," As a bull, all I got to do is buy a dip. "
"1698560","1699480"," That's all I got to do."
"1699520","1700400"," Look for a dip to buy."
"1700680","1701460"," I got to hedge the market. "
"1702140","1703500"," I'm on a high right now."
"1704160","1706940"," I hedge the market and I look for a dip to buy."
"1707060","1710800"," You see the, you see the, the stance. "
"1713360","1715660"," Well, then an investor and a trader has to take."
"1715960","1718300"," It's a, it's not on me as a bull."
"1718300","1725040"," And I could care less as a bull if we, I care less if we, the farther we, the faster"
"1725040","1728660"," we get up here, the easier it is for me to buy a dip to go up. "
"1731570","1733670"," So the onus is on bears here."
"1736050","1737850"," Not on bulls, bulls don't care."
"1741570","1743730"," Both bulls can give a, just, they don't care. "
"1746210","1746970"," Where we go."
"1751450","1751990"," Excuse me."
"1753230","1753830"," So. "
"1755730","1758470"," We're going to take a look at the levels for today."
"1760650","1761830"," For the pivots."
"1763570","1765290"," Previous highs, previous lows. "
"1766990","1773940"," Pip points, 404.59. Right."
"1774440","1774660"," Hold on."
"1777020","1778040"," Scroll this down. "
"1778220","1778920"," Move these out of the way."
"1779720","1784300"," 404.59. There's your pivot right here."
"1786660","1794360"," First point of resistance is 408.52. I mean, snap this line here. "
"1795580","1797620"," 408.52. Look at that."
"1806980","1807660"," R1."
"1808980","1809980"," Right there. "
"1811800","1813880"," 410.35 is your next one."
"1819710","1820550"," Here's our two."
"1827930","1834810"," And then our three above right is 414.18. Way up here. "
"1844020","1844980"," Right there."
"1845140","1847060"," Do I think we get up here today?"
"1848200","1848920"," I don't know."
"1849200","1850140"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1850260","1854660"," If they announced a rate cut today, you probably go up here and bloodbath it down to 3000."
"1856080","1858340"," I always find it funny listening to bears say."
"1860200","1864500"," 50 points is going to bloodbath this market and all this other nonsense. "
"1866320","1872140"," If we get a 50 point rate hike, I'm probably going to blast down and then rip higher."
"1873100","1874520"," That's a viable dip in my view."
"1874740","1875380"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1875380","1876140"," That's a viable dip."
"1877460","1881040"," I would not be trying to buy a dip if we announced rate cuts."
"1881840","1882460"," Fuck no. "
"1882460","1890540"," So the pivot again is 404.59. It's right here."
"1893480","1895600"," Down below for the bears, right?"
"1896760","1897940"," We've got support."
"1898280","1904310"," One is 402.66. Close enough. "
"1908170","1909710"," You get rid of this shit right here."
"1909890","1910530"," Throw that in the trash."
"1914540","1924540"," Then we've got 398.83. 398.83. Close"
"1924540","1924780"," enough. "
"1929160","1930520"," Then we've got an S3."
"1930640","1932040"," We'll get rid of this one where that is."
"1934520","1936900"," We've got 396.90. Shocker. "
"1943260","1944340"," S3 right down there."
"1949440","1950740"," This is what the bulls want to hold."
"1950940","1951620"," We already know that, right?"
"1963170","1964210"," One minute chart. "
"1964950","1965370"," Oh, here we go."
"1965530","1967570"," The little day traders are out there right now like me."
"1968370","1970410"," Day traders out here this morning. "
"1970410","1971830"," They've been trying to do their thing."
"1973250","1973890"," Showboating."
"1979270","1980530"," R2 is over here. "
"1980910","1981430"," 409."
"1982430","1984190"," Let me try to get this right here."
"1985510","1988410"," It is 404.59. Close enough. "
"1989310","1994910"," R1 is 408.42. Right there."
"1996670","2001130"," R2 this morning is 410.35. I don't know why this is not."
"2001130","2004630"," Dude, it's not fucking doing what I want it to do. "
"2005750","2006770"," Here's R2."
"2008690","2012190"," We've got R3 up here, 404 or 414, 18."
"2012430","2012910"," Close enough though. "
"2018510","2020150"," That's two down below here."
"2021090","2024870"," 398.83. A little bit higher here."
"2025050","2025290"," There you go. "
"2025550","2025850"," S2."
"2026610","2028470"," I think you guys like trade to levels."
"2030090","2033150"," 396.88. 90. "
"2033610","2034070"," That's S3."
"2042460","2043000"," It's good."
"2043340","2044380"," Five minute chart right here. "
"2047590","2049489"," If you guys want to take a snap of that, you can."
"2053010","2054510"," I think I'm bringing this down."
"2063800","2065139"," You want to take a snap of that?"
"2065280","2067920"," You can for yourself so that you have something to trade today. "
"2074719","2075020"," Okay."
"2077889","2078270"," Excuse me."
"2080870","2083630"," The only thing bulls want to pay attention to today. "
"2087250","2088409"," Right down here."
"2091170","2092929"," Does that get bought or not?"
"2094670","2096350"," The only thing a bull wants to know."
"2097290","2102050"," We know that the next, I don't know why this isn't transferring, but we know that the. "
"2106980","2109120"," Right there's a big bad boy right there."
"2110520","2114700"," And right there's a big bad boy right here, 414."
"2115140","2116220"," Is that previous high, right?"
"2117680","2118700"," Right up there. "
"2121420","2124580"," We're going to try to have some guests on today too, and see if they can get some people on"
"2124580","2125000"," for you."
"2125760","2126020"," Okay."
"2127320","2128460"," Back in the one minute. "
"2128820","2129620"," Here's book map."
"2131320","2132920"," This is how you set up your day."
"2138280","2140080"," I sell every directional move. "
"2140800","2141620"," Someone just asked myself."
"2142640","2145980"," I sell every single directional move that I hold overnight at the bell."
"2146800","2147680"," It's a rule of mine. "
"2149000","2150680"," I don't care if it's call or put."
"2151820","2153260"," Every single one."
"2154040","2155260"," Every single time. "
"2158540","2159380"," I'm a day trader."
"2159660","2160140"," I trade to."
"2160960","2161960"," Some of my rules are this. "
"2162800","2163320"," I'm day trading."
"2164440","2165240"," I have a price target."
"2166920","2168340"," I trade to that price target. "
"2168900","2170420"," If it fails and comes back down."
"2171820","2174800"," I've got my ad place that I add in the place that I take my stops."
"2175920","2177720"," When I do a limit stop or stop limit below. "
"2178600","2180040"," I'll sometimes preset it."
"2181100","2185400"," Sometimes I'll hand decide if I'm going to hit my stops."
"2187460","2189880"," You've seen two, I think two or three streams ago. "
"2190720","2191760"," I had some stops."
"2192260","2192880"," What was the hand?"
"2193320","2193960"," I had some stops."
"2194720","2196620"," I told you, I'm not going to use it. "
"2196700","2197960"," I'm not going to hit my stops today."
"2198100","2199320"," I'm going to stay here in this trade."
"2199500","2201380"," I'm going to add to it so we can go up. "
"2204220","2205600"," All directional stuff."
"2206100","2206880"," All target based."
"2208260","2209980"," And I have some rules on trading. "
"2210200","2211120"," If I do an overnight trade."
"2211660","2214860"," I take the money in the bell and I reenter the trade if I need to or want to."
"2217770","2219390"," If I, same thing goes out. "
"2219470","2221030"," I do my one and three month trades."
"2221530","2222730"," I'm trading to a price target."
"2222730","2224010"," If I buy a call spread. "
"2224970","2226930"," I set them up for 300%."
"2226930","2227990"," Let's say I spent a dollar."
"2228570","2229270"," Trying to make $3. "
"2229730","2232770"," I'm always out of it at that, at that first dollar that I make."
"2234230","2236410"," 30% of the trade because of the time involved."
"2236410","2240010"," They don't usually make it or make the entire trade usually takes me to. "
"2241010","2242890"," To expiry for me to get the."
"2243990","2245510"," The rest of the trade to print."
"2245610","2246690"," So I'm usually. "
"2247550","2249270"," In for 30% that I'm out."
"2249470","2250750"," I build the trade around that stuff."
"2257100","2260500"," So if you're wondering that's how that's how it does some of the rules that I have. "
"2261780","2266680"," I had a friend of the stream yesterday asked about stops and adding."
"2266920","2268240"," So we're going to look at that real quick this morning."
"2268240","2270820"," Just clear something up that someone asking some questions. "
"2271600","2273580"," So and they didn't see it in stream yesterday."
"2273580","2276740"," So we're going to we're going to talk about some some setups here."
"2277580","2279220"," So here's an example right now. "
"2281660","2283740"," We're trading underneath the one minute trigger right."
"2285600","2287720"," So let's say I wanted to set up some puts here."
"2289760","2291920"," These are trade in our one minute trigger right now right. "
"2292160","2293640"," So if you're like I'm bearish here cap."
"2293920","2294860"," I want to take a put."
"2295780","2295920"," Right. "
"2297540","2299580"," So I'm going to add some puts right here."
"2301040","2304700"," Now that I'm not actually trading this right now but I'm going to show you as an example."
"2304980","2305300"," I've done this. "
"2305660","2307160"," I just every day in stream."
"2308500","2311140"," Let's say let's say I buy some some puts right here."
"2313580","2314020"," Right. "
"2315060","2317680"," And I want to see this market begin to roll over."
"2317960","2320000"," How do I construct that trade right."
"2320600","2322920"," I'm buying here right by input. "
"2324360","2328820"," You as your own trader if you're a trader day trader want to be a day trader."
"2329520","2333180"," You decide where you're going to add to your position."
"2333180","2336860"," If you're if your thesis like where's my thesis hold up here. "
"2338040","2339440"," Maybe it's right here right."
"2339640","2340000"," Maybe you're like."
"2342040","2345140"," We could squeeze higher briefly for some liquidity to go lower. "
"2346080","2348360"," Make these bulls think that we're going up right."
"2349900","2352100"," When is my thesis prove itself wrong."
"2352920","2354120"," When I'm constructing a trade. "
"2356160","2358200"," Okay so I'm going to put my stops up here."
"2360300","2360960"," Make sense."
"2361460","2362020"," Here's my stops. "
"2369690","2370130"," Right."
"2370350","2371450"," This is how I trade right."
"2371630","2372530"," There's my stops above. "
"2374390","2376850"," I could end up seeing the blue line turn around here."
"2380930","2382350"," I start to see price reverse."
"2384010","2384450"," Right. "
"2384730","2385330"," Triggers my stops."
"2385610","2387350"," I don't want to get caught in this bullshit do I."
"2387990","2388570"," Does that make sense."
"2393980","2397160"," So if you're constructing your trade. "
"2397960","2403380"," You have to decide where your stops are you going to preset them are you going to hand do them"
"2403380","2404840"," are you going to keep your finger on the button."
"2406540","2410360"," I don't make those decisions for you you make those decisions for yourself."
"2410980","2412220"," Sometimes people are like that. "
"2412780","2414140"," I don't want to do any of this cap."
"2415300","2420180"," I'm looking for entering this trade up here because I think there's going to be."
"2420980","2424240"," Quick squeeze higher and we're going to trap the bulls and before we get below. "
"2425980","2430220"," So you have to decide what what you pick your poison you pick your risk."
"2432420","2436520"," As to where we go or not you know sometimes I'll be sitting here to I think two or three"
"2436520","2437820"," days ago sitting here and."
"2439940","2444600"," I was watching a trade go like this up and down up and down up and down they were trying"
"2444600","2445840"," to squeeze me out of a trade. "
"2445840","2449100"," I had stops down below this was I believe last."
"2449460","2453020"," I don't know was last week or something earlier in the week."
"2454220","2458640"," And we went down below my stops and I said I'm not stopping out here you know my thesis was"
"2458640","2459100"," still up. "
"2459280","2462520"," My my my thesis was still up the."
"2463760","2466420"," Twenty seven EMA's were not broken."
"2467560","2471920"," And it's like a shake down I think we even had a whole segment on how recently. "
"2472560","2479660"," I've traded puts and there have been some liquidity breaks trying to shake out the actual move."
"2480460","2485680"," So that's for you to decide when you add to a position when you close the position of your thesis"
"2485680","2486500"," has been broken."
"2487940","2491080"," You know if you see if I see this blue line coming up here. "
"2494010","2499350"," And I see this green line where we're above the screen line right and the price is moving higher."
"2501490","2502530"," And I'm in puts."
"2504090","2509910"," Kind of shows that my my thesis is broken right we've broken past this previous high. "
"2510490","2513510"," Right my thesis is broken but if we're fucking around in here."
"2514290","2521150"," And there's a quick quick rip below my thesis and the lines haven't come down then my my thesis"
"2521150","2522010"," isn't broken yet."
"2522010","2522670"," Does that make sense?"
"2523510","2524850"," So you have to find out for yourself. "
"2525430","2531590"," What your thesis is what your price target is when you're taking profit when it fails and then"
"2531590","2531890"," also."
"2532930","2536090"," If your thesis hasn't been broken do you just stay in right?"
"2536370","2542190"," Do you do you do a diamond hand for your thesis to play out or to then or be broken."
"2542710","2547750"," That's called risk in the market which everybody has take on right and you have your own risk"
"2547750","2549590"," profile I have my own risk profile. "
"2553030","2560130"," This is gross that one up down up down nothing in here little day traders in here trying to."
"2561550","2564350"," I bet you the scalpers out there right now they're just like."
"2564890","2568870"," I'm going to buy this would sell this would buy this would sell this would buy this would sell"
"2568870","2569110"," this. "
"2571750","2574990"," All morning long we'll take a trade here once that's up."
"2580270","2581350"," Pull on here for a minute."
"2588620","2592760"," And so you're probably wondering as it come into two o'clock two 30 this afternoon there's two"
"2592760","2593880"," trades was a couple trades. "
"2595000","2596380"," You'll likely see."
"2598180","2600060"," Some short covering at some point."
"2601220","2602920"," You get better ass on that. "
"2604020","2605400"," You're going to see some short covering."
"2606780","2608440"," Now some panic short covering."
"2610280","2611180"," Probably wondering. "
"2613000","2615700"," You probably wonder what trade to take there's a couple."
"2619410","2621650"," If you're going to if you're going to trade this event."
"2623210","2628150"," Usually right around one thirty between eleven thirty and one thirty you'll see sometimes you'll"
"2628150","2628910"," see a pre move. "
"2629810","2632410"," And then you'll see a move the last half hour fifteen minutes."
"2633090","2636410"," I'll take trades right like last five minutes last fifteen minutes."
"2637610","2640070"," We'll see how the options chain looks this morning. "
"2641230","2644690"," And see if it's worth it to take a high target and a low target."
"2646070","2647430"," Some kind of a strangle."
"2648550","2650050"," They're difficult to manage. "
"2650370","2651590"," They're very stressful to manage."
"2653490","2655670"," You can sometimes see like this nice rip higher."
"2656690","2657170"," Into the event. "
"2658550","2660330"," You'll see that the bloodbath down."
"2661270","2664510"," Well actually it wouldn't be like that would be usually it's something like this."
"2665150","2666790"," Just barely misses. "
"2667590","2668870"," Just barely misses."
"2669850","2670770"," Slingshot back up."
"2670910","2673610"," You have to quickly sell both sides of that straddle. "
"2676610","2678230"," It's a very stressful trade."
"2678590","2679230"," I'll be honest with you."
"2679310","2679990"," I've taken this trade. "
"2680090","2680730"," It's very stressful."
"2681330","2685790"," I'm going to just see less like wack it and it'll seem like it's going back up and then it"
"2685790","2686490"," comes back down."
"2688090","2691470"," So you have to like just hold until print. "
"2692330","2694670"," If that sets itself up today we'll take that trade."
"2695710","2697690"," There's also a second trade and that's the."
"2698890","2699570"," That's the. "
"2701250","2701770"," Presser."
"2703070","2705970"," That's a really dangerous one you'll end up seeing an initial move."
"2706750","2709550"," And then you'll actually see another move inside the presser too. "
"2710990","2714770"," And then within all these trades you've got IV rolling off the market."
"2714770","2719960"," And as that IV rolls off the market."
"2721340","2723820"," Hedges come off the market we tend to squeeze higher. "
"2726480","2729000"," You're also trying to I mean this is the complicated right."
"2729200","2732760"," So then you're also got to think about what's being said if he says 50 BPS."
"2733540","2737140"," For me I hope that we blast down because I'm going to buy that dip. "
"2738020","2740340"," I hope I'll buy that dip all day long."
"2742760","2745280"," If he says we're pausing anything."
"2745280","2749120"," Anything pausing anything rate cuts. "
"2750880","2754260"," I think we're going to squeeze higher and look for liquidity to blast down."
"2756580","2757980"," Historically that's what happens."
"2758840","2761520"," I think it's a huge bull trap. "
"2761780","2764020"," I think people are going to get they're going to close their shorts."
"2764780","2767800"," You're going to have bulls not or bears not positioned properly."
"2768880","2774780"," You're going to have bulls long as fuck and they're going to provide the liquidity for us to race"
"2774780","2775200"," down. "
"2778980","2780400"," So that's my take on it."
"2781760","2784280"," Truly what I think if you want to know what I think's going to happen."
"2784280","2785380"," I think it's going to be the same. "
"2786420","2787900"," He is in the corner right now."
"2788920","2790920"," But I think he's going to call this 25 BPS."
"2791220","2793020"," I think he's going to get all bearish. "
"2793140","2796140"," He's going to hope that the market slowly trades down to 360."
"2797960","2801240"," We'll get a nice Bible bottom and we're going to trade up into the right."
"2803080","2806780"," I think everybody I think a lot of people out there always expect some kind of surprise. "
"2807100","2807980"," One way or the other."
"2808420","2810540"," If we get it, we know what to look for."
"2811100","2811960"," Or at least I do. "
"2812120","2812940"," I know what to look for."
"2813760","2814980"," For what I'm trading."
"2815300","2817080"," I think if they do a surprise. "
"2818260","2820680"," I'm going to pre pre idea of what I'm going to do."
"2822480","2825040"," If you're a brand new trader or."
"2826240","2828140"," You're not a day trader or you're. "
"2829400","2832960"," You're more of an investor or you like taking long trade stuff like that."
"2833700","2835020"," One month three month out."
"2835020","2836540"," This isn't your event. "
"2836840","2837860"," This is like your."
"2839520","2844160"," This is where you do a reaction trade and we talked about that earlier right."
"2844640","2846140"," If you see an initial move here. "
"2847980","2849940"," Not the initial move, but after the presser."
"2850380","2853720"," If you see this move down here, we start to get underneath it."
"2856040","2857800"," Believe it or not, even on. "
"2858200","2862260"," I guess on the downside, typically you can usually jump in on a put spread or something."
"2862260","2864120"," But you really are looking for."
"2865200","2867880"," You know, like if you get this blast down here and you're like, ooh. "
"2869020","2873180"," You ever notice that sometimes they'll come right back up into the bell, even if we're bearish."
"2874220","2878380"," And they'll reset all this trading and then the actual move is tomorrow."
"2878880","2880000"," Close or tomorrow. "
"2882900","2887420"," So you want to be closing your trades when you're near your price target."
"2887720","2888460"," Take your money and run."
"2888740","2889420"," Look for a reset. "
"2890280","2893720"," Every once in a while will blast down and just keep blasting."
"2894520","2897080"," And you'll be like, oh man, I missed that the whole trade."
"2897440","2897940"," I fucked up. "
"2898360","2901560"," Truth is if you were to run that trade 10 20 times."
"2902580","2904360"," You might, you know, it's like, it's like the."
"2904880","2907600"," It's like, it's like, um, I forget what it's called, but. "
"2910280","2914680"," Oh, I heard some guy in Fintuit say this or say that, right?"
"2914680","2915760"," It's into, into total."
"2916040","2919780"," If you run these trades back and if you run these trades over and over and over and over and"
"2919780","2924640"," over and over again, uh, you would have always been better just taking the money and running."
"2926020","2930960"," And then if we, if we make that blast down here, you reenter the trade once again. "
"2932760","2934520"," That's the reaction trade right there."
"2934560","2935700"," This is a reaction trade."
"2936000","2939140"," It's not just blindly, you'd be like, you meet some guy on Fintuit. "
"2939140","2940620"," It's probably going to $500 count."
"2941820","2943480"," Truly, I'm telling you, that's what it is."
"2943680","2948380"," Like I go to work all week long, I come home, cash my check and I'm hoping to hit it"
"2948380","2948560"," big. "
"2950000","2955620"," Uh, no long term trader, no long term investors out here, like I fucking let it all ride on us"
"2955620","2956640"," bloodbath and down here."
"2956720","2957180"," It's just nonsense."
"2958220","2960420"," Anyone that tells you that as a fucking liar, I'm sorry. "
"2962100","2964180"," If they're not a liar, they're going broke."
"2965120","2968400"," When you see 96% of people can't make money in this market."
"2968560","2971220"," It's because of the things that I'm telling you right now. "
"2971780","2973120"," They eventually blow up their account."
"2973340","2974120"," I've blown up my account."
"2974740","2977780"," I've blown up huge accounts doing that shit over the years. "
"2979480","2981140"," So I've already been through this."
"2981900","2983260"," I've actually done it myself."
"2983540","2987700"," So take these, take this as sage advice. "
"2988700","2992900"," You can easily blow up your account with these like, you know, I mean, you'll see me ship post at"
"2992900","2995700"," the finger point and never going going up and shit like that."
"2995780","2997820"," But if you think that I trade like that, fuck no."
"2998460","3002280"," It's still level to level to level to level to level to level to level to level. "
"3002660","3005460"," So I recommend you to do the same thing."
"3006320","3009820"," You know, during like new investor new trader out there."
"3010340","3011600"," This is just noise. "
"3012940","3014620"," All this is right here, right?"
"3016500","3019180"," It's going to this is the last part of the conversation."
"3019180","3025460"," This is only provide an idea of direction where we're headed next and how deep it's going to go."
"3026760","3027940"," And truth be told. "
"3029640","3031440"," I don't expect much on the Fed today."
"3031520","3035800"," I'm expecting to that no matter where we go up and down that we're going to we're going to probably"
"3035800","3036300"," come back."
"3038280","3040860"," Here or three seventy three eighty maybe. "
"3041400","3044460"," Maybe hang around three seventy five three eighty and we're going to wait for CPI."
"3045820","3047000"," Probably going to wait for."

"3433030","3434510"," I don't think anyone's long here. "
"3435010","3436710"," If you're long right here, let me know."
"3438090","3439130"," I don't think anyone's long."
"3439910","3441030"," I guess I own the underlying. "
"3441890","3443390"," But I own it way down below."
"3445670","3446950"," Way way way way down below."
"3449140","3450600"," I really don't care if we blast it. "
"3450600","3450920"," We're going to blast down."
"3459650","3460870"," About a fucking dip video."
"3463150","3467030"," Maybe he's a homeless people to join me in front of the fed building. "
"3469990","3471630"," Yeah, I'm in an accumulation phase."
"3471830","3472870"," I'm looking for stock stone."
"3476630","3479150"," Yeah, we'll get some venom charm probably out of this. "
"3481190","3486850"," If the news isn't too bad, if it's like if it's if that's the other side, someone just mentioned a"
"3486850","3487470"," venom charm."
"3487650","3489910"," We could get some venom charm if it's situation normal."
"3490690","3492590"," There'd be a Bible dip down below, hopefully. "
"3493250","3494450"," I'd really like to buy."
"3494650","3496810"," If I could buy 396, that'd be fucking stoked."
"3497570","3498350"," I'll be honest with you. "
"3498390","3501270"," If we can slam down a 396, I can buy that."
"3501870","3502830"," That's another interesting thing."
"3502930","3504230"," Somebody last night posted. "
"3505310","3507110"," Spock Emma posted something about."
"3509210","3511490"," The most calls ever bought was in."
"3512430","3515430"," There's only been so many instances we bought so many calls. "
"3515430","3519110"," And 10 15 days later, they didn't print."
"3520130","3522750"," I didn't make a comment on the post, but it was fascinating because."
"3523990","3524870"," They they. "
"3526210","3526930"," Talked about."
"3527850","3528290"," The quarter."
"3530570","3532850"," Where the GPM call we actually went up. "
"3533550","3534450"," Into the end of that quarter."
"3535450","3537390"," And what's fascinating about it is."
"3537850","3540630"," I was reading that post by Spock Emma and I was like, yeah, you know what?"
"3540750","3542530"," We weren't crazy about that post is that. "
"3542530","3545090"," If you were looking for a dip to buy though."
"3545590","3546350"," In that quarter."
"3547330","3550810"," So if you if you just waited for like 396 or 380. "
"3551390","3554030"," You would fucking print huge in that quarter."
"3555270","3558250"," And other examples in the past when you've had high call."
"3558630","3561390"," High call buying environments like we have had this past week. "
"3562570","3563870"," It's all about positioning."
"3565890","3568350"," So if you actually look at that post that they made yesterday."
"3571130","3573670"," That would imply that there's so many calls out there. "
"3578770","3580330"," It's not actually a negative thing."
"3580630","3581410"," If you look at the quarter."
"3582270","3583810"," It's implying to you that. "
"3584470","3586250"," You would actually look for a dip."
"3587350","3589610"," Down here for these call buyers that are stuck."
"3590250","3591130"," They're trapped up here. "
"3591550","3592850"," They would actually fuel."
"3595650","3596610"," Trapped call buyers."
"3598110","3599330"," Let's just say they're trapped. "
"3600410","3602310"," It's used as a as a."
"3602830","3603230"," A heel."
"3604630","3606990"," They would blast down here and you would actually."
"3608010","3611690"," You would actually have them trying to rebuy just to get back to here. "
"3612230","3615650"," And they would actually provide the fuel for us to come higher than a quarter."
"3616650","3619150"," So if you're if you're a bull you're just looking for a dip to buy."
"3619390","3621130"," Honestly you're just looking for a dip to buy. "
"3622450","3623630"," That's what you're looking for."
"3629280","3630640"," Whatever that dip is."
"3632600","3637960"," I'm assuming here that bulls are taking a I'm assuming here that you're looking at previous. "
"3640060","3641820"," I'm assuming here that you're looking at previous."
"3644080","3648720"," I have to see rate decisions because you're going to you want that blast up and then the cell."
"3649980","3651320"," You want the cell down. "
"3651600","3653820"," So this is the first trade for bulls are like yeah we're going up."
"3653980","3655000"," I'll take the money and run."
"3656240","3658080"," And then I'll look for a dip to buy down below. "
"3658940","3662820"," And then I'll close my play in a day and then if we roll over next day."
"3664400","3665100"," So be it."
"3673240","3674720"," All right give me a second here. "
"3681220","3682180"," Yeah let me look at."
"3683020","3685880"," Let me look at some options saying right now with you."
"3696160","3697020"," Take a peek. "
"3697820","3701180"," Markets really well hedged right now the markets hedged like."
"3703160","3705620"," The markets hedged like they're long."
"3707640","3711500"," I saw some other discussion last night about how the markets not well hedged. "
"3711500","3712120"," Pointing out."
"3713360","3714580"," Pointing out data points."
"3715240","3716480"," It's just not the case. "
"3717180","3720580"," The market is very well hedged right now if they're not the market is not positioned."
"3724200","3728420"," In a cell cell positioning the market is positioned in."
"3730540","3733700"," That they bought the market and that they have a hedge. "
"3734020","3738160"," If you look at the options chain on SPX look at the options chain on spy."
"3739500","3740920"," They're very well hedged."
"3740980","3745080"," They're hedged down at three twenty they're hedged at two fifty three twenty. "
"3746000","3750860"," And they're hedged at three sixty with big money billions billions in hedging."
"3752540","3754520"," So it looks like they own the underlying."
"3756400","3759080"," Right now we'll get market breath as well. "
"3760100","3765460"," We didn't see price follow market breath down which is good to see positive sign."
"3765460","3767300"," Say in the option chain."
"3768760","3772140"," We've got you know three ninety five or only eleven cents. "
"3777310","3779870"," Three ninety five C's are eleven cents."
"3782030","3783470"," They're cheap they're cheap."
"3784970","3787030"," I don't maybe we don't get down to three ninety five. "
"3787450","3791730"," So let's take a look at what they're pricing in here."
"3792070","3794050"," Three ninety five is right down here."
"3794170","3794950"," Yeah so about here. "
"3796130","3799930"," So it would be buying three ninety five C's are probably buying something more than the money three"
"3799930","3801210"," ninety nine three ninety eight."
"3801930","3804210"," Those are thirty cents for a three ninety eight P."
"3805290","3806970"," We got a boatload of."
"3809030","3814050"," In the money calls we have forty set forty seven thousand four oh six C's. "
"3815290","3819270"," These are zero dates that are costing two dollars and twenty eight cents right now."
"3821290","3824210"," They're very expensive two dollars thirty two cents."
"3824950","3828090"," To play a zero date is in my view too expensive. "
"3833620","3838600"," On the upside we've got four oh eight four oh seven those are still a dollar fifty."
"3839680","3844000"," I'd be I think there's a trap above I think that like I think any of the four tens four"
"3844000","3844700"," elevens."
"3845440","3848040"," I don't think the initial push up you're going to get that trade. "
"3848940","3852840"," I think you're going to get the initial squeeze higher and then we'll come back down and you'll"
"3852840","3853380"," lose your money."
"3854580","3858780"," Personally that's what I think so I don't see a call side trade right now."
"3860360","3861980"," Just at the moment I don't. "
"3869930","3874670"," Four hundred P's for February second there's sixteen thousand of them."
"3875430","3877370"," Four hundred P for February two."
"3880360","3883600"," Four hundred P for February third thirteen thousand. "
"3885160","3885980"," Put heavy."
"3888100","3893380"," This is fascinating February six there's a two thousand puts for eight dollars at four eleven."
"3895360","3897420"," Let's look above four eleven over here. "
"3898560","3899340"," Right over here."
"3900840","3903740"," Someone's betting that even if we come up we're coming back down over here."
"3912190","3913750"," A lot of calls man. "
"3914910","3920810"," Four fourteen C's this could be a straddle too there's a there's another concentration of calls on"
"3920810","3922930"," February this is February sixth I'm talking about."
"3922930","3926210"," There's another eleven thousand calls on four fourteen C."
"3926930","3928630"," Those are a dollar thirty three."
"3930570","3932650"," You don't even need to hold those to expiry. "
"3936660","3942700"," You look here in the next week's options chain and see what people are trading."
"3943700","3945180"," Punch in the money puts above."
"3953800","3959580"," Yeah looks like a looks like even if we go up I think looks like most people are positioned for"
"3959580","3960440"," a squeeze higher. "
"3960440","3964580"," And then we come back down the following week."
"3971700","3983260"," I think"
"3983260","3984140"," it's pretty for you."
"3987900","3988940"," There's a pivot. "
"3995200","3996400"," There's our one."
"3998980","4000220"," There's S one."
"4001880","4012080"," There we"
"4012080","4012450"," go. "
"4019070","4021110"," Clining volume coming into the market right now."
"4028770","4030930"," Yeah put a limit on your order and your spreads."
"4031710","4032870"," That's a good good tip. "
"4036470","4040350"," Hey Hendrix what are the price targets on those monthly weekly monthly VWOPS."
"4052240","4053920"," Yeah we can face making a very good point."
"4060030","4063570"," Yeah I think today's stuff they got to I think today is I think we're waiting on CPI. "
"4065430","4071490"," I feel like the market's probably going to decouple from the Fed at some point and do its own"
"4071490","4071750"," thing."
"4082790","4084050"," I'll give you a second here."
"4096720","4098380"," It's a second I got to contact some people. "
"4103550","4105229"," MBLY went to all-time highs just then."
"4105510","4105670"," Damn."
"4118740","4121120"," You do this a second I get some work to do in the background here. "
"4202590","4204710"," And one second I got something I got to do here."
"4212310","4218310"," And I'll put the."
"4274160","4275340"," Yeah that's the second here. "
"4298730","4300090"," Okay that's okay."
"4317070","4319550"," Did you see some downside movement in the S&P 500."
"4320090","4324090"," No news catalyst so far but analysts on the wires are saying that stocks have dropped today as"
"4324090","4328410"," traders braced for the Federal Reserve's rate decision or passing another launch of data that's"
"4328410","4331230"," sent to conflicting signals about the American economy. "
"4331390","4339370"," So the S&P 500 and the tech heavy NASDAQ 100 fell and report showed jobs openings surging in stark"

"4700730","4705110"," and this applies to today as well, if we can get any kind of nonsense where we come down here,"
"4705490","4711390"," and the report's not bad, I'm looking for a dip to buy, like I am, I am money town down"
"4711390","4718730"," here, it feels so much better, we even just blast down and hold this, we like have a FOMC sell"
"4718730","4724390"," off down here, and then it actually comes back, like so we'll be watching this today, if we like"
"4724390","4731750"," blast down here on FOMC news, you're like oh I'm super bearish, if we don't get this hold to take"

"4761310","4768890"," truth is, where's the money trade, it's lower, if you're a bull it's like 396 is the live wire down"
"4768890","4777120"," here, closer we get to down here, the more greedy I get to buy a call, and we'll look at"
"4777120","4785180"," this now, we've got a 408s and 407s were what two or three dollars up here, and they just took"
"4785180","4795020"," your money and ran, that's too funny, lopsided trading, they posted"
"4795020","4799480"," about that last night right, I was like you used to be able to come into the FOMC meetings, they'd"
"4799480","4805580"," be lopsided, you'd have like everybody fucking long, nobody's short, so you'd take the short side"
"4805580","4814840"," of the trade, everybody fucking short, so you'd take the long side of the trade, hilarious,"
"4815680","4823620"," absolutely hilarious, and you guys think that shit moves because of news but it doesn't, it moves"
"4823620","4833970"," because of money, yeah you're going"
"4833970","4844070"," to get them, bulls need to spend 402, 386,"

"4950920","4960810"," a, we got a guest at one PM today, yeah I said he was buying China last night, I"
"4960810","4966330"," didn't see that, check baby how you doing this morning,"
"4966850","4983770"," we just erased yesterday, well it"
"4983770","4993490"," caused the market to decouple from the Fed, if you look back historically, if you look back in the"
"4993490","5002090"," 50s, 60s if you look back at the Volcker moments, if the Fed stays the course, and they're like"
"5002090","5009090"," we're going to keep raising rates slowly over time, basically it's a wait and see attitude for"
"5009090","5016830"," inflation, a wait and see attitude for unemployment to come down, and the other thing too is it"
"5016830","5026710"," keeps people employed, it's almost like a stance change, some of this has to do with politics, you"
"5026710","5032910"," heard the other day, you heard the other day Biden did a speech where he said we want people to"
"5032910","5042850"," have jobs, that kind of piqued my ears up reminds me of the 1950s and 1970s, 1950s, 60s"
"5042850","5047590"," Volcker has some, there's some about Volckerisms in there too from the Fed themselves, and then"
"5047590","5056670"," Biden's got this weird thing coming out with using rates to temper the stock market, you'll see a"
"5056670","5061730"," decoupling typically, historically you will, where we'll trade sideways and up slightly, and then"
"5061730","5066750"," once they do get to their, if let's say their rate target, they change it to 8 or 9 or"
"5066750","5072650"," 10, then they actually cut rates, it would be cutting rates because unemployment's going crazy and"
"5072650","5076910"," high, and then you'll actually see that last little dump in the market, so that would be the"
"5076910","5084110"," decoupling, we actually started decoupling already in May, we started decoupling of the stock"
"5084110","5091710"," market, and you should see people say well decoupling already has decoupled, so if the Fed stays"
"5091710","5098230"," its course, you should see that decoupling continue, not actually decoupled, it's already kind of"
"5098230","5104850"," decoupled, so we're kind of aware they want us to be, we trade up, we trade down, and we've been"
"5104850","5108410"," trading up right and we've been holding bottoms, we have a lower high, right, we don't have to go"
"5108410","5114870"," back and show you that on a daily chart, you already see we have a lower high, so the decoupling"
"5114870","5121810"," I guess should continue, now is there any case or or bull case for us to go up from here,"
"5122010","5126770"," I don't think so, or I mean like up from here like all-time highs in the next three months,"
"5126770","5134750"," probably not, I don't see that how that could happen, I see us trading sideways into the right and"
"5134750","5141250"," up slowly, and then at some points when the economic conditions, macro conditions all align"
"5141250","5151490"," together, now that you'll have your last capitulation move in the market, yes"
"5151490","5156290"," we're holding this just fine, I don't think you're going to lose this right now, at this point I"
"5156290","5163870"," don't think you're going to lose this, if you do we know where the target is down below, even if"
"5163870","5168070"," you want to lose this right now if you're a bear, probably not going to happen just yet, probably"
"5168070","5186370"," wait for the rate decision unless it comes out, I"
"5186370","5190110"," think it's proved itself, I think if you look back who said it's Dylan saying but the market cares"
"5190110","5194990"," about what everyone else thinks, I don't have an idea what will happen, oh it says sarcasm agreed,"
"5196050","5205270"," I think it's always, wouldn't you agree Dylan it's always react right, so it's always react, give"

"5716770","5723750"," of where the decoupling comes from, not fucked it up but the you know the timing wasn't right, I"
"5723750","5727830"," guess they fucked it up with originally when they dumped all the money in the market right when"
"5727830","5735030"," they're not in the market but well I don't know, I don't know if I think that's bad either, I"

"5848770","5858450"," morning yeah it was kind of tough right, it was kind of tough"
"5858450","5868310"," with how it was distributed too and that the timing is all wrong right now, it's"
"5868310","5872670"," kind of a fucked up situation, I'm not going to review, I went through this, it took me like half"
"5872670","5876390"," an hour to go through this yesterday and I'm not gonna, if you ever want to go back and watch"
"5876390","5884130"," that rant, I think I started the rant two days ago, it's found a bit of some more yesterday and"
"5884130","5890590"," today just, I get all fired up on that shit and then I'm tired and you can always go back"
"5890590","5895890"," and watch, I'll try to cut some of these things out and repackage them into videos for you, like"
"5895890","5903710"," what's my take on the Fed and you know what's the, I try upon what the Fed's job is that"
"5903710","5909110"," they're trying to make you believe certain things they don't really impact a lot of the stuff that"
"5909110","5917470"," you think that they do, have some other videos on Fed funds rate, unemployment rate, inflation"
"5917470","5924790"," rate, inverted yield curve, all that kind of stuff and how it really affects you as an investor, as"
"5924790","5932610"," a trader, really simple stuff where you'd have a firm idea on how the market moves with that stuff."
"5933090","5936250"," You know, if you're a trader and investor, you don't really need to know everything, you don't"
"5936250","5945050"," really need to care too much about the intricacies, you need to really know though how these things"
"5945050","5948430"," impact the market, right?"
"5948730","5953240"," There's some things you need to, some basic things you need to know about the bond market, there's"
"5953240","5960600"," some basic things you need to know about some macro things, how it impacts the stock market, the"
"5960600","5965520"," difference between main street, difference between macro news and you know, you as a cash market"
"5965520","5972180"," participant, how they directly impact you, it clears up a lot, it makes, you know, it's"
"5972180","5977580"," interesting, I used to, I talked about this once before, but when I was a young trader, I used to"
"5977580","5978260"," trade, right?"
"5978500","5983900"," And I had no idea where support and resistance was, I had no idea what oversold and underbought"
"5983900","5986220"," conditions were, they just had no idea, right?"
"5986320","5991380"," Over the years you pick up all the stuff as a retail trader and you're taught and you read books"
"5991380","5995800"," and you watch videos and you talk to other people and all this other stuff."
"5997320","6001640"," And then, you know, there's that phase where you're like, ah, what are these people talking about?"
"6001800","6003560"," They're talking about all this gibberish that I understand. "
"6004900","6008880"," So you want to learn a basic idea of that stuff."
"6009380","6014720"," You can do into more depth, I guess, and become a smarter trader."
"6014720","6020740"," For me personally, I'm an intelligent guy and the smarter I got, the more money I lost. "
"6021360","6029620"," So I try to be a dumb trader, dumb investor, the dumber I keep shit, I seem to make more"
"6029620","6029920"," money."
"6031040","6035440"," The more complicated I make stuff for myself, I seem to lose money."
"6035620","6036720"," I used to go down like the rabbit hole. "
"6037040","6040640"," I'm a Tesla bull, Tesla lover, Tesla owner."
"6041780","6043380"," I zone all that shit out now."
"6043640","6048400"," Like, I don't even, I get the base, like, I'll get like the topical information as to what's going"
"6048400","6056860"," on, but I try not to get too much under the surface because if I do, I start drinking the"
"6056860","6060060"," Kool-Aid and price doesn't always follow the Kool-Aid, right?"
"6060580","6061280"," That's up and down. "
"6064680","6068920"," You learn about accumulation distribution, try to separate all that stuff, right?"
"6069540","6072100"," Try to separate the stock market from Main Streets."
"6072920","6074240"," That's the real key here."
"6080230","6081310"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"6081950","6082910"," 3.5 is outstanding."
"6083490","6086290"," I was just thinking about taxes for this past week."

"6407890","6408290"," We're ready to go."
"6412910","6414950"," Review some news with you this morning."
"6424680","6429200"," US Treasury Department, until the debt limit is suspended or increased, debt limit related"
"6429200","6434660"," constraints will lead to greater than normal variability in benchmark bill issuance and significant"
"6434660","6436220"," usage of cash management. "
"6436860","6442500"," US Treasury Department also saying this morning we maintain the assessment that it is unlikely that"
"6442500","6446920"," cash and extraordinary debt measures will be exhausted before early June."
"6449140","6456220"," We do know that previously in history when we've had a debt crisis, we've had a capitulation moment"
"6456220","6457680"," in the market where we had a bloodbath."
"6459720","6466920"," If we already know that's happened, I posit that leading into June May, you might want to get some"
"6466920","6473900"," outside the money put or at least keep an eye on the put side of the options chain to see"
"6473900","6479000"," if the dealers begin to creep in with some premium. "
"6479420","6488260"," You could actually make money not on a debt crisis but in just the premium that you can scrape and"
"6488260","6489060"," the lead up to that."
"6489280","6499080"," So if you start, I would set a Google alert or an alarm on your"
"6499080","6509060"," phone or your email or whatever you do, sometime in May, start watching the put side on like the"
"6509060","6519620"," spy or the cues and if you see the stock market going up and yet you see price creep on"
"6519620","6523880"," the put side of the options chain and outside the money puts, I'd look at strikes that end in 0"
"6523880","6527180"," and 5 dated for sometime in late June."
"6528120","6532120"," You can sometimes just capture the vol before it happens. "
"6533160","6539180"," So you buy some really cheap puts slightly outside the money and in May at some points and you'll"
"6539180","6540720"," actually see you can scrape money."
"6540880","6544720"," You don't even have to hold these things as as two benefits to it."
"6544720","6546700"," You could hold them into the beginning of June. "
"6546860","6554800"," They could front run a really nice steep decline in the stock market rather than them waiting until"
"6554800","6556380"," June 24th."
"6556380","6561480"," You could end up seeing like a front ran in the beginning of June."
"6561500","6564920"," If you don't see it get a front ran but you see that vol, you can capture then you could"
"6564920","6567440"," actually close them up before you even get there and just take the money and run. "
"6571790","6576450"," US Treasury Department's also saying we do not anticipate changes to nominal floating rate, new"

"8277570","8278350"," Oppose."
"8282370","8283990"," And mess with this."

"8313719","8315799"," Oh back there first."
"8319700","8321680"," There first."
"8342660","8346080"," We've got three minutes, we'll see if in best we'll join us here in just a moment. "
"8352660","8353820"," Just a second here."
"8362680","8364080"," Yeah, I'm still long here, I haven't sold."
"8366559","8368059"," Hope this works. "
"8402980","8416980"," Just"
"8416980","8427200"," a second"
"8427200","8427200"," here."
"8453460","8453940"," Okay."
"8455100","8456900"," Oh, they're trying to sell this, huh?"
"8457700","8459580"," Reversal candle, a little bit of tweezers. "
"8467720","8469020"," Trying to shake me out."
"8470760","8477340"," Now I'm down 40% on these calls and when I was in for like $1.12 or something, down"
"8477340","8478580"," to 84 cents on those calls."
"8497500","8499960"," Let me pay attention to the stream right here. "
"8501600","8506960"," We've got some targets down below 40364, 40330, can't hold here."
"8507780","8509660"," I had some stops up here but I took them off."
"8509660","8513400"," You can see the destruction that happened to my calls here, right?"
"8513780","8518660"," You can see that we're trying to trade underneath the pivot here into a negative posture, trying to"
"8518660","8519420"," hold this under. "
"8519720","8521520"," Bears want to get underneath here if they can."
"8544270","8545770"," Not a good look right here."
"8545890","8547090"," We're close to the hourly too. "
"8547410","8548690"," I mean, here's the other thing to be looking at."
"8549010","8550630"," We're trying to trade this off the hourly."
"8551110","8556370"," You can see they threw this right under, threw this right under the hourly because it was no big"
"8556370","8556590"," deal. "
"8556590","8559390"," It's hourly is just screaming up right now."
"8560350","8563790"," Probably going to add to my position in a DCA into it."
"8563950","8564770"," So give me a second here. "
"8567510","8568510"," Hold on here."
"8571760","8572360"," All right."
"8572360","8573940"," So I grabbed for 85 cents. "
"8574800","8577440"," So I'm in now for like 90, 92 cents, something like that."
"8580300","8582100"," Definitely don't want to be given up the hourly."
"8588550","8593230"," The hourly is I'll give you where the exact hourly is the same place 404 12. "
"8594170","8597130"," So I'll move this one over 404 12."
"8597870","8598850"," Right about here."
"8600450","8604210"," It's the same place that they bought before bought right here. "
"8604690","8607250"," So I just DCA added to my position right here."
"8607310","8609870"," We'll see if we can go up and do another one of these bullshit things above."
"8612720","8617200"," In for a four zero nine at ninety three or four cents. "
"8617200","8619560"," I haven't looked at my activity yet to see exactly what it is."
"8620740","8622500"," Somewhere in the low nineties."
"8668040","8669120"," Boo doggy. "
"8674370","8676130"," Try to sell this baby down."
"8680560","8682360"," There's that same red line below."
"8684100","8686540"," Looks like they're trying to rug pull this green. "
"8686840","8689120"," You can see him trying to rug pull this down below."
"8689280","8690760"," You can see buyers disappearing."
"8691960","8698380"," We'll turn this to yellow now instead of green and see earlier we had this support over here. "
"8698980","8701460"," And then now we have weak buyers down below."
"8703000","8707980"," They want to send it down here and get a new low at 403 64 and 403 30."
"8711730","8713690"," I am long right here long calls. "
"8714050","8714530"," Believe it or not."
"8715730","8716850"," Breaking my own rules."
"8721600","8722680"," Trading and interviewing. "
"8733360","8734800"," All right, 1204."
"8737260","8740840"," Still missing somebody to still have an interview ready to go."
"8746750","8749430"," Let me check and see if I'm doing something wrong in the background. "
"8765100","8765800"," Long here."
"8767440","8768560"," Okay, frame."
"8772580","8775900"," It says I'm on hold on guys says I'm on here hold on. "

"8780460","8781680"," I think he's here. "

"8875000","8877720"," Yeah, you're in Washington right now, right?"
"8878420","8882210"," You want to tell everybody who you are."
"8882210","8883950"," I've met you on Penn to it, right?"
"8884550","8884850"," Yeah."
"8886130","8888730"," Yeah, let me give everybody just a bit of a background. "
"8889930","8890310"," I won't."
"8890410","8899690"," I won't go into extreme detail, but from a trading standpoint, I am what you would call a self"
"8899690","8903390"," taught self guided retail trader that."
"8904890","8910210"," Receive some really good advice and I'll call it mentoring ship from a few people along the way. "
"8912850","8918550"," I've been doing this for about five years is when I really started to take it more seriously."
"8919130","8920090"," The last three."
"8921150","8926550"," Has been essentially, I'm not going to say full time because I've got a couple of other endeavors"
"8926550","8927610"," that I get involved in. "
"8928950","8934430"," But I'm, I don't have a formal financial background, anything like that."
"8935450","8937510"," So I'm just a regular guy."
"8938730","8939810"," I got a."
"8941370","8942950"," Degree in engineering. "
"8943830","8950710"," Spend some time working with some big semiconductor companies did a bunch of water related work"
"8950710","8951290"," with them."
"8952430","8956290"," And design work did some work for the Navy."
"8957430","8960930"," And I, some of you may know what that is. "
"8962450","8965750"," My passions are skiing, fishing, sailing."
"8966310","8968750"," How did you get involved in investing or trading?"
"8968930","8972350"," How did you find yourself in as a retail, becoming a retail trader?"
"8973890","8982030"," It was a situation where you get up and I liked what I was doing from a career standpoint."
"8982850","8988990"," But you realize that there's a lot of other money to be made and I didn't have to. "
"8989410","8991330"," I mean, I work, we all work hard."
"8991570","8998330"," I know you get up early hours, but the, I'll call it the payout kind of that return on my"
"8998330","8999870"," investment, my time and effort."
"9000950","9002590"," Wasn't where I thought it should be. "
"9003230","9010250"," So I just started to explore and realize that, you know, there are a lot of people that make a"
"9010250","9017650"," ton of money in the markets and a friend of my father's was a full time trader."
"9018190","9024870"," And he's the one who kind of introduced me to some of the, the basics and just kind of went"
"9024870","9028550"," from there and he was kind of the first mentor that I had."
"9028550","9031510"," So he was an old bear, bear sterns guy. "
"9031790","9032550"," No, no kidding."
"9032970","9034090"," Yep, since retired."
"9036330","9038890"," How about your via thrust was softballs at you?"
"9038990","9040950"," So just some softballs. "
"9041370","9047030"," How did you know, let's, let's see if you had a friend, a family friend that introduced you to the"
"9047030","9047670"," stock market."
"9048050","9052390"," Was there a trade or was there, did you buy a stock or did you get involved?"
"9052830","9054050"," What did you do that said to you?"
"9054090","9054650"," This is for me."
"9057610","9060530"," It was a memorable experience from your first. "
"9060530","9061310"," Yeah, I know."
"9061350","9063310"," Like, wow, this is for me, I'm going to stick with this."
"9063990","9070390"," It was kind of a handful of, it was a, I'll call it a, just a group of trades, semiconductor"
"9070390","9079150"," industry segment at the time where it was a bit of, I had the kind of the technical analysis, I'm"
"9079150","9079990"," not going to say down. "
"9079990","9081490"," I mean, you're learning all the time."
"9081710","9087110"," I learn every, every day, I'm always learning something new, but I had a, a base of confidence"
"9087110","9087470"," level."
"9088050","9090730"," And I, I, we can get into some of the details. "
"9091410","9096590"," I mean, I'm a, I'm a technical analysis guy, first and foremost, and that's just because of, it"
"9096590","9100250"," falls out of my technical background, the way my mind is wired."
"9101890","9109870"," But at the time it was AMD and Intel, and there was a period of time where the two of"
"9109870","9111890"," those didn't do the same thing."
"9112270","9113730"," They kind of went against each other. "
"9115850","9117690"," And, and then my end was this."
"9118530","9119090"," What's that?"
"9119770","9120990"," When did you get started?"
"9121190","9121630"," You mind me asking?"
"9122530","9128770"," Yeah, it was, while I first, like I said, took it seriously five years ago, this would go, this"
"9128770","9132150"," would go back a little over nine ish."
"9132510","9132650"," Yeah. "
"9132910","9133570"," Let's see, we're 23."
"9133910","9135710"," So yeah, about nine years ago."
"9137890","9142170"," And so kind of, I was just looking at it and it's like, you know what, when one moves one"
"9142170","9144190"," way, the other one's going to behave a little differently. "
"9146230","9152350"," And I had three successful trades and everything I was doing kind of, I had my plan, lay the plan"
"9152350","9153310"," out, trade the plan."
"9153570","9157070"," If you go against the plan, you're going to shoot yourself in the foot."
"9158090","9158750"," And it worked. "
"9159210","9164210"," Seems to come together after about three to five years, then you get, you become this more"
"9164210","9166130"," consistent or more confident."
"9166590","9168570"," And this is what I want to do the next five years, right?"
"9168890","9169250"," It seems like."
"9169250","9170070"," Yeah, exactly. "
"9170430","9171490"," It takes time."
"9171870","9172850"," There's no shortcuts."
"9173250","9178590"," And no matter what people are trying to tell you, sell you pedal a bunch of bullshit. "
"9179170","9181150"," And I'll just let everybody know right now."
"9182010","9184390"," When I start to get on a roll, I start to cuss."
"9184630","9186070"," So you like fouling. "
"9186370","9191510"," If you're, if I'm going to scare people off, just be forewarned."
"9191750","9192670"," It may come."
"9194710","9198970"," So they can move all this stuff down here so they can see what's happening in the background here"
"9198970","9202230"," because they're probably trying to watch if we're getting underneath here. "
"9204130","9207990"," So next thing would be to move this over here a little bit."
"9208390","9209650"," Have you sold your calls yet?"
"9210350","9212170"," No, you know, I was, I was doing some."
"9212850","9216090"," Normally I don't do this as a kind of a out of a character for me. "
"9216110","9217330"," I'll usually run my stops."
"9220370","9224170"," And I actually doubled down in here too."
"9224910","9229370"," I actually bought, we see I bought at $1.12 or something. "
"9229710","9230610"," I think right in here."
"9231130","9234410"," I had some stops lower and then I raised my stops up."
"9235090","9237990"," This is where my original stops were right where my cursor is"
"9237990","9247290"," right here. "
"9247290","9249310"," It's like 92.93 cents."
"9249430","9251270"," They're trying to run it down on me right now."
"9252290","9253390"," I don't normally do that. "
"9253690","9256270"," So, but I'm trying, we got like technical stuff."
"9256370","9257390"," I'm doing the background here."
"9257530","9261530"," So I'm like, oh, I'll just stay in them and see if we squeeze higher at some point and make"
"9261530","9262130"," it back. "
"9262390","9264810"," Normally though, I would have been out earlier."
"9265690","9268850"," Let's get a good lesson right now for not trading to your plan."
"9269630","9274170"," I'm kind of doing it right now in stream, not trading to my plan now hoping that it comes back"
"9274170","9275290"," to at least on fuck myself. "
"9276370","9277350"," Which is what it is."
"9277530","9279730"," You try to, you try to, you see a lot of fun."
"9280270","9280990"," Yeah, exactly. "
"9281330","9287830"," I mean, well, everything that, I mean, ahead of FOMC is, I mean, I've, I mean, I repeat things that"
"9287830","9289310"," people have said in here before."
"9289510","9290630"," But it really is, it's true."
"9290950","9291710"," It's a bunch of noise. "
"9291850","9295190"," I mean, up until 2 p.m. Eastern today."
"9295710","9299750"," This thing's going to ping pong back around unless there's some sort of external event."
"9299750","9305330"," I don't see any big dips, huge dips or big jump ups until then. "
"9305410","9306770"," Everybody's just going to wait and see mode."
"9306930","9309830"," And it's just going to kind of oscillate and do whatever the hell it wants to."
"9310250","9315450"," Yeah, my, my take is I'm looking for, if I have a take on today, it's how deep can I"
"9315450","9316310"," get to buy a dip?"
"9317170","9322230"," And if we break some key levels, if we don't break those key levels, I'll buy that dip. "
"9322530","9326970"," If we break below and hold them, I'm going to put on the bear suit, maybe and look if we"
"9326970","9328490"," can get even lower over time."
"9329070","9332570"," We still have, we still have CPI coming out."
"9332730","9333230"," We still have. "
"9333970","9335350"," Yeah, there's, what is it?"
"9335430","9337310"," We got farm coming out on Friday too, right?"
"9337610","9339210"," We got non farm payroll on Friday."
"9339450","9342410"," We've got tech earnings haven't come out yet."
"9342570","9344030"," I think they start tomorrow, the big ones. "
"9344730","9345410"," Yep, got."
"9345990","9347130"," Let's say apples tomorrow."
"9347130","9348590"," I know that one's coming out tomorrow. "
"9349090","9352670"," And February is kind of known as a pretty volatile month as it is, right?"
"9353490","9353530"," Yeah."
"9354270","9359130"," Yeah, February is, I mean, for me, I, I don't do as much."
"9359470","9362230"," I mean, I'm, I'm always, I'm addicted to it now. "
"9362530","9365010"," So I'm always bucking around in the market doing something."
"9366190","9372670"," But I'm, I'm known to, I had to someplace a combination of fine steam destinations or go someplace"
"9372670","9377510"," tropical in February because you stand a high chance of getting burned this month."
"9378230","9380110"," It's just seasonality is a real thing. "
"9380110","9381270"," It is."
"9383930","9388970"," I was, you hear time was going somewhere warmer for the month of February."
"9389130","9389770"," I like that idea. "
"9391810","9396550"," Yeah, I'm a, I'm a big fan of Hawaii being on the west coast."
"9397470","9398770"," I spend a fair amount of time in Hawaii."
"9399630","9401050"," We were talking about. "
"9402870","9407730"," At some point trying to migrate somewhere south or west."
"9409990","9412230"," To do some more sailing."
"9412730","9417630"," We sell in the Great Lakes right now, but we want to do some offshore sailing. "
"9418530","9426410"," Our end goal is to, we can get the kids out and about to try to do a milk run"
"9426410","9427450"," around the world if we could."
"9427610","9428970"," It's been a lifelong dream to do that."
"9431010","9432710"," That would be that would be a blast. "
"9433210","9433670"," Yeah, right?"
"9433890","9435050"," Sounds sounds good, doesn't it?"
"9435050","9436150"," That would be fun."
"9436510","9439350"," Yeah, I bounced around the kind of the Pacific rim."
"9439730","9447030"," I mean, that's kind of my from a, a geographical standpoint and spend time on the water. "
"9447370","9451810"," I mean, I like the Pacific Ocean, the kind of grew up on the west coast."
"9452130","9457790"," So, and I've from a business travel standpoint, other things."
"9457790","9464410"," I mean, I've spent a lot of time in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan. "
"9466490","9470950"," A little bit of time in Malaysia, some of the Philippines, some of the, a lot of this was like"
"9470950","9473130"," older days when I was doing work on the semiconductor industry."
"9473550","9479190"," So think of a, think of a country that's got a chip plant or two or a hotspot and I've"
"9479190","9480670"," probably been there at some point."
"9481970","9482410"," Sorry. "
"9482570","9482650"," Yeah."
"9483830","9490090"," As a trader, what it, like, so this is as an example, you're just talking about what I tend to"
"9490090","9493530"," do for myself as a place or whatever this market is."
"9493930","9500970"," I feel like I've been reduced to where I buy an oversold condition on a, like if we're on a"
"9500970","9505970"," daily chart, I wait for extreme oversold conditions and I'll throw a call spread on. "
"9505970","9512230"," And then on extreme overbought conditions, I'll put a put spread on the put spreads."
"9512230","9517050"," Don't tend to, that we tend to say a more irrational longer at the tops than the bottoms."
"9517050","9520270"," You have the capitulation moment on that trade for one to three months. "
"9520990","9523770"," And then I'm kind of like you're saying, like a dick to the market."
"9523770","9528250"," So I have a separate account that I day trade in to keep me busy because, of course, you've got"
"9528250","9530730"," the largest soap opera in the world being the stock market."
"9530730","9530790"," Yeah. "
"9533030","9535030"," So that's what my trading has been reduced to."
"9535130","9539210"," My investing as well, as a matter of fact, I just bought the first time I bought a Tesla on"
"9539210","9541790"," the bottom to try to begin."
"9542010","9543570"," So I'll do this DCA accumulation. "
"9546030","9550310"," I saw Tesla down at a hundred and before he got there, a matter of fact, I missed the trade,"
"9550550","9553130"," missed the buy at a hundred."
"9553330","9554830"," I was like, I want ninety five bucks."
"9555010","9559090"," And I think on that day, I was like, oh, when we open, hopefully we can plunge down, hit ninety"
"9559090","9560070"," five, I'll get a buy. "
"9561270","9566150"," Because myself, I'm like, yeah, if I can buy ninety five, buy the sixties, buy the forties, I'd be"
"9566150","9566730"," a happy guy."
"9566850","9569730"," I'll pass left over and at least own this ticker."
"9570970","9578590"," And this is the first time I've bought anything with some conviction in probably almost, well,"
"9578870","9580910"," actually bought three, four years. "
"9581630","9584990"," I was starting to sell out in the end of 2020."
"9584990","9587590"," I was starting to sell out of any kind of long term positions."
"9588270","9593250"," And now I'm looking for some kind of entry into the market. "
"9593270","9595090"," Are you even considering that right now?"
"9595710","9600590"," Are you looking for like, what Mike Wilson says, how this is the last leg of the bear bear market"
"9600590","9601090"," for now?"
"9602670","9604870"," Yeah, just day trading or monthly trading."
"9605150","9608010"," What's your strategies right now for where we are in the market?"
"9608010","9609570"," Well, I'm with you."
"9610010","9617410"," I purchased, I'll call it a reasonable amount of Tesla, just a little bit ago, because I've been"
"9617410","9617730"," watching. "
"9618330","9621110"," I mean, I use the same, same basic approach."
"9621230","9626430"," I use day trading, but I'll just take time scales and turn them into days and weeks."
"9626770","9629450"," So I'm not looking at ticks or minutes. "
"9630430","9634670"," And it's still supply demand, support resistance, and those levels are there for a reason."
"9634670","9640850"," And the stocks market behaves and reacts to those levels."
"9641030","9645950"," So I was just watching as Tesla kind of burns through all of these different support levels. "
"9646430","9650190"," And there was a couple of unfilled gaps down below and it filled one."
"9650810","9652810"," And it was getting down to the major one."
"9653110","9655030"," And then it started to kind of slow down. "
"9655450","9657230"," And so I did the same thing."
"9657530","9658890"," I didn't buy at the exact bottom."
"9658890","9662770"," I'm more conservative in terms of when I kind of enter some of the things. "
"9663610","9670510"," So I was like 120 ish when I started to move myself back in."
"9670730","9677190"," I've always had a Tesla position and full disclosure for kind of everybody."
"9678170","9681510"," I do some work with Tesla as a contractor. "
"9682650","9686370"," So I can't say there are some things I can say there's some things I can't say."
"9686650","9691930"," And what I do doesn't doesn't materially affect and it doesn't prevent me from actually trading the"
"9691930","9692130"," stock."
"9692170","9695830"," I just can't go out on public and talk about all the things that I do. "
"9696450","9703030"," Just as a high level so that everybody's aware has to do with my engineering background and work"
"9703030","9703590"," that I've done."
"9704650","9707910"," I work with teams on the battery side of things."
"9708390","9718190"," So a family member that's a whole day is a high project manager"
"9718190","9718690"," for Tesla. "
"9719050","9721610"," And then I've got some other fellow members that work some of their competitors."
"9721850","9723350"," They seem to rotate around those companies."
"9723610","9725990"," They bounce from from one EV company to another. "
"9726470","9727490"," We all get together."
"9727490","9728590"," We go skiing and stuff."
"9728690","9732150"," We go hiking, biking and I'm like, just don't talk about that shit in front of me. "
"9732190","9732950"," I'm like, I don't want to hear it."
"9733050","9734070"," I don't want to know any material."
"9735130","9735510"," Yeah. "
"9736130","9736510"," Is he in Reno?"
"9737250","9738430"," He is in Reno."
"9738850","9741830"," He was in San Francisco for some time and now he's in Reno."
"9742410","9744590"," He and I probably crossed paths at some point. "
"9744750","9745590"," Fair chance of that."
"9746070","9748530"," I'll ask if you know him after the stream at some point."
"9748730","9748810"," Sure. "
"9749030","9749830"," And that would be interesting."
"9750730","9751030"," Yeah."
"9753470","9758370"," So, yeah, that's the only purchase from a what I will call a long term investing standpoint. "
"9758410","9764130"," I've basically added to my existing Tesla position that I've had for years."
"9764130","9767390"," You know, it's funny too, because I don't get to talk to many people about this."
"9768430","9769870"," I have like the. "
"9770630","9773790"," I see the day to day Tesla gang."
"9775910","9776770"," And the."
"9779330","9783030"," The I don't like towing the line of being Tesla gang on Twitter. "
"9783150","9790130"," And then when I know engineers within Tesla, it's completely two different worlds and it's so wild"
"9790130","9790850"," to see."
"9792670","9793970"," The different takes."
"9794870","9799810"," It's fascinating too, because I want to say how many years ago is this?"
"9800010","9800230"," This was. "
"9802050","9804970"," Shoot, this had to be seven or eight or nine years ago."
"9805430","9810810"," Remember, in fact, my family member has been with Tesla on and off or has worked for Tesla, not"
"9810810","9811530"," worked for Tesla."
"9813290","9813730"," For. "
"9815270","9817450"," On and off for at least a decade."
"9817770","9821650"," And I still hear people talk about the trim lines and all that stuff."
"9821830","9825530"," And I'm like, oh, that's an old school talking point of the original Tesla engineers. "
"9826010","9828190"," Don't talk about it publicly on Twitter and stuff, but."
"9829730","9834530"," Just fascinating to see the difference of what people are focused on."
"9834530","9838390"," For consumption and then what engineers talk about is completely different. "
"9838650","9839890"," Even the arguments behind."
"9841870","9843910"," Self driving is fascinating too."
"9844110","9844330"," I'm not. "
"9844470","9845650"," I don't talk about this stuff."
"9845790","9845910"," Probably."
"9846050","9847770"," I'm not going to talk about it here publicly either. "
"9851530","9854630"," I've witnessed a few of those arguments on."
"9856650","9859350"," They're pretty honest in these arguments behind the scene."
"9860790","9861410"," It's a."
"9862830","9863770"," Let me put this. "
"9863950","9864610"," It's an environment."
"9864610","9872610"," The environment that has been created is, in my opinion, excellent from the standpoint of we're"
"9872610","9874850"," here to solve problems where there's no."
"9875750","9877810"," There's not a bunch. "
"9877990","9881490"," There's not this big hierarchy of levels."
"9881830","9883590"," I mean, obviously there's managers and things like that."
"9883810","9884870"," And there's a chain of commands. "
"9884870","9886510"," The best way I can describe it."
"9886630","9888050"," Better test of my understanding."
"9888490","9890410"," If you work for Tesla, things are good right now. "
"9890610","9890690"," So."
"9891130","9891350"," Yeah."
"9891650","9891710"," Yeah. "
"9891870","9893030"," And it's, it's a no nonsense."
"9893530","9894190"," No bullshit."
"9895210","9897310"," These are our high, high level objectives. "
"9897990","9902110"," These are the tasks we need to get to now that are going to lead to the next milestones to"
"9902110","9904250"," accomplish the objectives and then we'll move on from there."
"9904650","9906350"," So it's like just climbing the hill."
"9906930","9908130"," Everything else is extraneous. "
"9908370","9909030"," Put it to the side."
"9909910","9917810"," And when it comes to solving the problems, I mean, there's whether it's somebody who's been there a"
"9917810","9924410"," new engineer or a high level manager that's been there since the beginning."
"9925490","9928750"," In those discussions, everybody's on equal footing. "
"9928750","9930050"," It's wild too."
"9930230","9932870"," They don't hear it talked about too much here and there."
"9932930","9934290"," I've heard it talked about, but. "
"9935670","9940710"," There was a lot that I don't want to say brain hairs from the beginning that went away to help"
"9940710","9942970"," other startups, but they came back, which is wild."
"9944070","9948950"," That they came back in the fact that they have all the brain back inside Tesla right now is"
"9948950","9949110"," amazing."
"9949150","9951530"," So I'm excited for the future on Tesla. "
"9951930","9953190"," That's my question for you."
"9953710","9954550"," Take in."
"9955150","9956290"," Yeah, so am I."
"9956290","9956970"," Yeah, I'm very excited. "
"9957230","9960110"," Right now for Tesla and what's coming down the pike for them."
"9960670","9962110"," Those are some other questions."
"9962610","9966890"," So, I'm going to ask you some, not some funny ones, but some real softballs. "
"9967050","9967530"," They're just a good one."
"9969890","9970910"," Let me see here."
"9971870","9975810"," I'll ask you some simple ones, right?"
"9976010","9977570"," So what's your favorite movie of all time?"
"9977690","9978090"," Do you have one?"
"9978810","9981330"," Wow, favorite movie. "
"9981730","9982310"," Yeah, it."
"9983350","9985030"," Well, how about genre movie?"
"9985290","9987470"," I like."
"9988370","9989770"," Favorite science fiction movie. "
"9990310","9991830"," Favorite science fiction movie is aliens."
"9992590","9993690"," Oh, that's a good one."
"9993830","9994290"," I like aliens. "
"9994490","9995710"," It's my favorite sci-fi movie."
"9996470","9997990"," Yeah, as far as I."
"9999210","10001770"," My all time favorite movie is."
"10002670","10004510"," It's kind of an older school one. "
"10004510","10007030"," I really like Jaws."
"10007550","10008910"," Who Jaws is a great movie."
"10009190","10010470"," There's just something about it. "
"10010790","10011950"," I mean, I know it was done."
"10012130","10012970"," I think I think that movie."
"10013410","10016030"," They made that in the 70s, late 70s. "
"10016390","10017190"," Might have been early 80s."
"10017310","10018030"," I'd have to look that up."
"10018150","10018810"," Was it 78?"
"10019310","10019310"," Maybe. "
"10019410","10019670"," I don't know."
"10019930","10020650"," 78, 70s."
"10020750","10021270"," I think was. "
"10021450","10021810"," I don't know."
"10022150","10026530"," I mean, it's, I mean, it's an older movie, but in my opinion."
"10026870","10031190"," I mean, there are things about it that are dated if you watch it again, but a lot of it"
"10031190","10032130"," still holds up. "
"10033190","10035650"," Especially some of the stuff when they're out on the water."
"10036250","10037850"," And I just love the captain."
"10038370","10042810"," I mean, he's, I know somebody who was just like him before he passed away. "
"10043230","10043310"," Yeah."
"10043750","10044210"," I knew that."
"10044330","10045550"," I knew that type of guy. "
"10046030","10048210"," So maybe that's one of the reasons I like that movie."
"10048730","10052910"," I went back and watched it recently and the two things that stood out to, or three things that"
"10052910","10053770"," stood out to me was."
"10055370","10061370"," The three things would be first off when they would film movies, they kind of look like something"
"10061370","10062850"," you'd experience in real life. "
"10063330","10069190"," And then the second thing would be the actors male female doesn't matter."
"10069390","10072910"," But the actors look to look like somebody that you would experience in real life."
"10073030","10075410"," That'd meet this guy or this gal or whatever in life. "
"10075590","10076670"," And then the last part would be."
"10077910","10082690"," I feel like I feel like actors today are they're almost like groomed, right?"
"10083170","10087530"," Am I either part of Hollywood or I went to a great school?"
"10088370","10088690"," It's rare."
"10088990","10093690"," I feel like it's rare to say that you find someone with pure talent like that, that thing that"
"10093690","10094230"," clicks. "
"10095450","10097290"," And like as a person, right?"
"10097530","10106070"," Like maybe Dustin Hoffman or even who is the guy who's the guy that was the guy?"
"10107690","10108850"," You could just meet them up."
"10109010","10110590"," You could, you know those people in real life."
"10110770","10114190"," So you kind of like, you're kind of like, yeah, I can identify with this. "
"10114790","10115150"," Yeah."
"10115830","10117750"," I think that's missing in movies."
"10118110","10119670"," I don't know why I'm bringing that up in the stream right now. "
"10119770","10123490"," But I always try to ask a question that's kind of off the cuff, not having anything to do with"
"10123490","10124310"," the financial markets."
"10125510","10128810"," So I'm going to ask you something about the financial market or but spy today."
"10129830","10132690"," I'm going to screw up the chart here for everyone to look at. "
"10133670","10139370"," I put a, put a couple of like buy and sell boxes above and below here."
"10140330","10143930"," And I think spy is going to rebound for you."
"10144730","10147130"," I'm watching E.S. and I see E.S. turning. "
"10147370","10149310"," So spy is going to follow suit."
"10150610","10152070"," And I'll show this to you."
"10152410","10153490"," I'll show this to you. "
"10153630","10154210"," Get rid of these."
"10155610","10157130"," This nonsense sandwich thing."
"10157290","10160130"," Give rid of some of this stuff because it's not really pertinent. "
"10162830","10165870"," And so I just have some questions for you."
"10165890","10169050"," Do you think that there's supply above at 408 or so?"
"10169050","10171930"," Do you think we can squeeze past that supply here at 408?"
"10172330","10177190"," Do you think we can go up to 414 and retest that previous high that we had an automatic sell"
"10177190","10178050"," on today?"
"10178050","10184310"," Do you think, if let's say I have good news that the market responds well to higher than 408, 414."
"10186690","10187470"," Let's see. "
"10188310","10192490"," I'm going to put maybe in the market on this run or."
"10192930","10193110"," Yeah."
"10194150","10201110"," Well, I've got, if we have, I'll give you kind of my, my both, my views on this, both high"
"10201110","10201570"," and low. "
"10202850","10203370"," Yeah."
"10203650","10210170"," So we get good news, whether it's, maybe it's a quarter point and I'll call it good, good future"
"10210170","10213250"," guidance on what they, what they're going to do with the interest rates."
"10215010","10220850"," From a, from an E.S. perspective, futures, we've got a crack 4100. "
"10222710","10225010"," So, I mean, you're going to be looking at."
"10225890","10228790"," For a weight on futures, maybe or the three dollars."
"10228830","10231290"," Yeah, I'm looking at that right now about 408 ish. "
"10231510","10231670"," Yeah."
"10231830","10231950"," Yeah."
"10232110","10232950"," Break through that. "
"10233330","10236530"," Maybe right now $2.30 and that positive on that."
"10236770","10244150"," Yeah, in my opinion, that's a trigger point and we could easily see between 30 and 60 points above"
"10244150","10244550"," that."
"10244970","10246490"," Papa, very, very quickly. "
"10247210","10249770"," It's kind of a big deal right here, right?"
"10250090","10250550"," Yep."
"10250930","10252350"," That's a, that's a major level."
"10252590","10257190"," We clear that there's going to be another pop and then it's going to be tested again. "
"10259290","10261230"," So 41 60."
"10261990","10267750"," So, yeah, you're looking at four, four, 14, four, 13 is on the table."
"10267870","10269390"," If we have positive news. "
"10270210","10274710"," Now, if we get a quick jump up there and when I say quick, I'm talking."
"10274710","10278310"," I don't see this potentially happening all in one day."
"10279050","10280990"," I mean, crazier things have happened. "
"10281850","10284970"," But you get a good run today towards the end of day."
"10285990","10286910"," Overnight's accepted."
"10287450","10288550"," So you don't lose those gains. "
"10288850","10292190"," And then you kind of finish that target up to 41 60."
"10292770","10296050"," So let's say for 14 and spy."
"10297370","10301350"," That then you've got the stage set for what's payroll look like. "
"10301350","10305350"," And we may give some of that back and that could be a spy where people take profits."
"10306150","10313850"," So that's an area that if we have positive run, if we get up to 41 60 in ES, I"
"10313850","10315030"," may be start taking shorts."
"10315990","10319230"," I'm starting layering in shorts above that looking for a dip. "
"10319510","10319830"," Yes."
"10319870","10320850"," Here's Friday right here."
"10320910","10323990"," So what best is trying to say is we get some good news. "
"10325130","10326490"," This is over the court."
"10326610","10328010"," It's like a daily good news."
"10328570","10332090"," Come back and down into a non farm payroll some ball on Friday. "
"10332730","10340530"," We've got some tech reports in here and then you start taking some profit into Friday, leading into"
"10340530","10340990"," next week."
"10341630","10342330"," What would you think?"
"10342510","10344690"," What would you think care what bad news would be?"
"10344890","10349490"," Like what could is there anything that's like a flinch moment for the market?"
"10349490","10353410"," If, uh, tape house says, uh, we're doing 50 basis points."
"10353410","10354270"," Do you think we plunge?"
"10355010","10360950"," You know, squeeze higher for some, uh, Yeah, 50, 50 basis points. "
"10361030","10368430"," I think we've got a, we have a retest of, um, yeah, let me, I'm going to take a look"
"10368430","10368710"," at something."
"10368930","10373270"," So I need to do some spy numbers in addition to the, um, yes."
"10373850","10378150"," We're going to, we're going to test, um, 40, 20, 4,000 on ES. "
"10378150","10380970"," If we get 50 basis points, um, guaranteed."
"10381630","10383110"," They will test that level."
"10383370","10384630"," That's a very significant. "
"10384990","10386150"," Oh, yes, that's like that."
"10386350","10391730"," That's that nine, uh, that's that excuse me that, um, 996, 997 level."
"10391830","10394550"," It's a pretty significant level for trend at least, right?"
"10395150","10397970"," It's a, that's a big deal to, to maintain that. "
"10398210","10399150"," Yeah, both."
"10399290","10404630"," I mean, both can't lose that because that level also represents kind of the top of that."
"10404630","10410130"," So at this point, we're looking at 13 plus months, kind of that bear channel, that bear trend that"
"10410130","10410610"," we've been in. "
"10411110","10417250"," Yes, is, I mean, we've moved above that and we've stayed above that, which is good, but breaking"
"10417250","10421970"," back below that, that level is, that's, that's bad news."
"10422810","10425990"," Um, that takes us to 39 60."
"10426650","10428030"," Um, pretty quickly. "
"10428710","10434570"," And if that really helps with the fucking 75 and then possibly even the 360 low for the quarter,"
"10434570","10434890"," right?"
"10435430","10435910"," Yeah."
"10437010","10437490"," Yeah."
"10437550","10440190"," And then there are bears out there that are saying we're going lower than 360. "
"10440770","10444170"," We know that the JPM hedge has been, so they've, they've monitored."
"10444390","10447090"," Well, basically they've got their, they've monetized the upside."
"10447510","10452370"," They've got, uh, basically free puts down a 360 and they've got a hedge down at third three zero"
"10452370","10453050"," six zero. "
"10453590","10455470"," In case you have that bloodbath moments."
"10457290","10457770"," Yeah."
"10457770","10460990"," The 20th, the low on the, what was it, the 25th. "
"10461610","10465910"," Um, if that low was lost, yeah, the 25th was a big day, right?"
"10466350","10467430"," Yeah, that was a big day."
"10467710","10472870"," Cause you had continuation of the selling previously and then we had that big rebound."
"10473750","10476450"," Um, and that was like a hundred points went up. "
"10476810","10477090"," Yeah."
"10477190","10477890"," It's right over here."
"10477910","10481750"," This was the, this was like the, the last known demand down here that rains. "
"10483810","10485170"," 39354 something there."
"10485270","10487770"," I've got a box over here kind of corresponding with it."
"10488150","10489450"," Uh, looking for that. "
"10489610","10492130"," I mean, it's kind of like the last, last gig for the bull."
"10492130","10492270"," Yeah."
"10492370","10493130"," That's kind of neat. "
"10493330","10495390"," For me, they kind of need to own this down here."
"10495710","10496650"," They don't own this."
"10497170","10498550"," Uh, we're heading down another. "
"10499950","10502050"," It probably had to pull on here."
"10502470","10502910"," Yeah."
"10503110","10509150"," This, this may sound like, um, hyperbole or something, but we lose that level. "
"10509150","10517930"," Um, especially if there's shitty payroll news to follow the stage is set for a possible three and a"
"10517930","10519390"," half to five percent drop."
"10519930","10520750"," In a day."
"10521070","10521910"," In a day. "
"10521970","10524110"," Cause you'd have bad news on top of bad news."
"10524530","10525570"," Yeah, that's a fair point too."
"10526070","10527570"," How big are the candles, right?"
"10528330","10528570"," Yeah. "
"10529250","10530990"," How big are the candles on today?"
"10531250","10534150"," That's because that's a key."
"10534150","10536390"," Do we get a report here today?"
"10536510","10541330"," If the selling is really like small or if the selling is big, it's going to give us a huge"
"10541330","10543850"," indication as if we're going down or not, right?"
"10544950","10545430"," Yeah."
"10545810","10547030"," Does the dip get bought here?"
"10547210","10548510"," Does the dip get bought here?"
"10548930","10552650"," If these dips aren't bought, uh, it's pretty bearish, right?"
"10553250","10553610"," Usually. "
"10555350","10555830"," Usually."
"10556190","10556290"," Yeah."
"10556650","10563890"," I mean, as I, I tell, I mean, folks that, um, kind of follow me. "
"10563890","10570550"," And people that I talk to, I mean, pay, pay attention, watch those, watch those key levels and"
"10570550","10571950"," watch how price behaves there."
"10572470","10574230"," Does it just slice right through it?"
"10574630","10576330"," Does it fiddle fart around?"
"10576670","10578590"," Kind of fuck around there, bounce back and forth."
"10579410","10581610"," Um, you want to know, does it hold there or not?"
"10582170","10587050"," Um, and once you have, if it, if it's dropping, if it's holding at a support, it means it's going"
"10587050","10587690"," to go back up. "
"10588170","10588850"," Just be patient."
"10589070","10589470"," It'll happen."
"10589470","10595750"," We've seen like, we've seen the trade, the death down here, like destruction down here on previous"
"10595750","10596610"," events. "
"10597790","10601770"," And we haven't held below these levels and then we whipsaw back up."
"10602330","10607430"," Uh, the following day or two, or even three days later, we whipsaw back up and end up being"
"10607430","10607730"," trapped."
"10607730","10608690"," We're a bearish. "
"10608830","10610030"," You really need to see like."
"10611090","10614130"," You know, the big panels down and then the hold underneath."
"10615230","10616710"," Yeah, everybody wants. "
"10617790","10618310"," Right."
"10618890","10620890"," Everybody wants the market to go up."
"10621510","10625890"," Um, we're now having a couple of tests that are going to test that theory. "
"10626490","10628430"," Can the market actually sustain?"
"10628990","10630650"," I mean, FOMC is a big catalyst."
"10631330","10632730"," And then payroll is a test."
"10633070","10638430"," If it survives those tests, we're going to go up and it's going to be 4,200 plus. "
"10639450","10640730"," Cause it will survive the test."
"10641010","10641710"," But if it doesn't."
"10643470","10643950"," Yeah. "
"10644410","10648250"," But if it doesn't survive those tests, look out below."
"10648770","10649050"," Yeah."
"10650550","10651410"," True that. "
"10652630","10654530"," Uh, I agree with that statement."
"10654850","10655330"," 100%."
"10655330","10657790"," I am fascinated here to see what we, what we do. "
"10657870","10660370"," I would like to see the market cool off a little bit."
"10660910","10665510"," Uh, I would like to see that retest that kind of confirms if we're in a bullish or a switch"
"10665510","10666130"," over here."
"10666350","10670590"," Or if not, I do like the idea of a quarterly low of 3600. "
"10670590","10672090"," At some point."
"10672550","10676190"," I like the idea of what you're saying too with, um, with non-farm payroll."
"10676610","10681070"," And I still like that if like getting some of these reports out, getting the non-farm payroll,"
"10681070","10682830"," getting the CPR report out. "
"10682830","10687150"," And hopefully we can take some money, head back down, find a nice fat bottom and the quarter to buy"
"10687150","10688230"," for a summer run."
"10688450","10690230"," Late spring, early summer run."
"10691090","10694130"," Uh, and they've got a bunch of all coming out for June too. "
"10694130","10697910"," So, uh, it'd make it for a really nice run down the road."
"10700530","10700970"," Yep."
"10701410","10702030"," All right. "
"10702270","10705330"," Uh, well, tell us a little bit about what you do in Fintuit."
"10705410","10706190"," I know you've got a newsletter."
"10708090","10708490"," Yeah. "
"10708610","10709610"," What are you doing?"
"10709790","10711010"," I know you do something on Fintuit."
"10711210","10712750"," You told me the other day, which I agree with."
"10712870","10716350"," You say, uh, I just try to keep people or people have skin in the game. "
"10716570","10718350"," Tell them about yourself on Fintuit and what you do."
"10718970","10719370"," Sure."
"10719750","10720050"," Yeah. "
"10720290","10730030"," So I've got, um, uh, basically have a daily, um, it's a small sub, uh, uh,"
"10730350","10732270"," it's a patron site."
"10732770","10736190"," Um, that I help a handful of people at this point."
"10736470","10737050"," It's been slowly growing. "
"10737730","10744710"," Um, when I, my opinion, dirt cheap to get into because I, as I tell people, um, I want to"
"10744710","10744930"," help."
"10745150","10750070"," I mean, at this point, I feel like I've learned enough and I can give back."
"10750590","10757350"," Um, I have a admittedly my own style in terms of the technical analysis and the tools that I use. "
"10757350","10764090"," Um, I'm not, I'm aware of things like seasonality and understanding the events, the catalyst events"
"10764090","10766110"," like F O and C, C P I."
"10766390","10771270"," These payroll things and the impacts they can have positively, negatively on the market."
"10771990","10778030"," Um, but first and foremost, I'm watching my technical analysis setups and tools."
"10778250","10783530"," So I take that and I generate, I'm sure, but I'm sure at this point, lots of you have seen,"
"10783970","10793090"," um, my daily, um, um, Twitter posts of the, uh, uh, what my pivot levels are and kind of the,"
"10793230","10798050"," the very abbreviated version of kind of what my bearable cases look like. "
"10798210","10801930"," It's the levels are broken down or go up."
"10802330","10807570"," Um, but behind the scenes to folks that are, um, following me in my newsletter."
"10808430","10812890"," Um, there's, uh, anywhere from a page to kind of five pages. "
"10812890","10817010"," Um, that go into the details as to my thought process."
"10817010","10820870"," Why I'm thinking, um, a bear case may happen."
"10821050","10822610"," Why I think a bull case may happen. "
"10822890","10826370"," What are the things that are going to drive them and how to react to those?"
"10826910","10832010"," Cause as I, as I say repeatedly, um, never ever guess."
"10832470","10834990"," I don't guess I don't speculate on what the market's going to do."
"10835070","10838110"," I may speculate kind of openly, but I don't put money on speculation. "
"10839050","10842070"," I react to what the market does, which is why I haven't done shit today."
"10842510","10847650"," And I'm going to wait to see what their wonderful guy, Jay has to say and watch the market go"
"10847650","10849870"," up, down, whatever the hell it's going to do."
"10850030","10854130"," And then I know, okay, that's the trend that's going to be moving us forward for the next at least"
"10854130","10854830"," week or so. "
"10855330","10858130"," Um, so I can start to play that."
"10858550","10860930"," So I react to what the market tells me."
"10861690","10862930"," And then trade accordingly. "
"10863370","10867370"," You know, I found, um, in my own, uh, investing trading path."
"10868250","10874310"," That I, as I, I did different trading styles until I found what was good for me."
"10874790","10881630"," And one of the best things that I've ever, I've paid for services, I've paid for all kinds of shit"
"10881630","10882110"," over the years. "
"10882410","10884150"," Like I tried every flow service out there."
"10884890","10892730"," Uh, one of the key parts of my trading journey was to, uh, follow people that have their own style"
"10892730","10894770"," of trading, uh, what's worked for them."
"10894770","10896870"," And, uh, that's helped develop me as a trader. "
"10897750","10902430"," Uh, so if you guys have some questions and, you know, so on Viscos on, on FinTwit."
"10902990","10909110"," And, uh, I always, my thing for me was, uh, I find, find other traders that are successful,"
"10909490","10910370"," investors that are successful."
"10911050","10913110"," And try to absorb whatever I can from them. "
"10913250","10916530"," If I can, so if I've got my own toolbox, I'm always out there trying to find another tool for"
"10916530","10916890"," myself."
"10917430","10919990"," Uh, it might be a better trader to be a better investor."
"10920470","10924790"," Um, and, uh, adopt whatever other people are doing when they're successful. "
"10925450","10928530"," Uh, does everybody out there, anyone out there have a question for investment?"
"10928930","10929770"," Do you guys follow him?"
"10929930","10933690"," I try to put your, um, your handle out there on Twitter for you."
"10934230","10936690"," Those people that follow you to see what you're doing in the market."
"10937250","10940750"," Yeah, if you've got questions, don't, don't hesitate to ask them. "
"10940830","10942650"," I mean, I, I like you, Captain."
"10942650","10943750"," I mean, I'm a sponge."
"10943810","10945950"," So I'm, I've absorbed everything. "
"10945950","10950590"," I love following you on, on Ben to it because I always want that."
"10951370","10955250"," Um, I'm not trying to be in my own echo chamber chamber all the time."
"10955330","10959890"," I was like, I got to follow all these other guys because they have their own different viewpoints"
"10959890","10960690"," on the market. "
"10961130","10962410"," And they take this seriously."
"10962830","10963650"," I know you take it seriously."
"10963790","10966130"," So, you know, I find you to be, uh, quality. "
"10967610","10974710"," I'd have to say, I mean, I'm also a, and I'm open about this as far as like trading tools"
"10974710","10975930"," and things that will make."
"10975930","10976830"," Make my life easier."
"10977450","10984710"," Um, I'm also an open thief as far as, I mean, I asked people, but it's like, Hey, can I"
"10984710","10985750"," have access to that?"
"10986170","10987950"," Um, do you have the code for that?"
"10988130","10989010"," You mind sharing that?"
"10989190","10991090"," I mean, I do that stuff all the time. "
"10991230","10995350"," I mean, I picked up a ton of stuff from Brian Watt when he was more active."
"10995530","10995930"," He's amazing."
"10996710","10997330"," He is amazing. "
"10997330","10998690"," He literally is the goat."
"10998850","11003730"," I mean, as far as a kind of a, a revision back to the mean and understanding."
"11004630","11008770"," The, because he had so much time and understanding that the market will get stretched. "
"11009750","11012710"," And when you get too far out, it's going to come back."
"11013190","11016270"," So that way he talks about that stretching in the market and how it comes back."
"11017150","11017590"," Yeah. "
"11018370","11024070"," And that was, those guys like, ball whiz and E mini wizard and a whole bunch of other guys talk"
"11024070","11026350"," about the market stretching all the time to it."
"11028140","11032060"," And how it comes back into, uh, mean, revision and to, uh, and to it."
"11033520","11035780"," Yeah, I mean, I learned a ton from him. "
"11036140","11038240"," Um, I mean, and I learned stuff from you."
"11038380","11039200"," I mean, I follow you."
"11039300","11040240"," I don't mean. "
"11041440","11047600"," Act actively or openly, um, respond to everything, but I've still learned a ton of stuff from you"
"11047600","11050080"," on kind of the options and the way you view things because you're right."
"11050580","11055120"," You've got to, in my opinion, you've got to take in all of these different viewpoints."
"11055880","11058340"," I mean, there's a lot of really good bowls out there. "
"11058480","11060120"," There's a lot of really good bears out there."
"11060120","11060840"," Yeah, there are."
"11061160","11065340"," They're just happy they're inherent biases and some of them will just wait. "
"11065520","11069200"," And it's like when you have the bulls, they're going to look for their opportunity and then they're"
"11069200","11070400"," going to jump on those dips."
"11071120","11072200"," I think they're an extra trader."
"11072980","11076100"," It's easy for you to identify who's actually in the market and who's not. "
"11077120","11077520"," Yep."
"11077900","11081840"," Not too hard to figure out like who's actually got some skin out there and who does it."
"11081980","11082100"," Exactly. "
"11082100","11088160"," Especially for us future traders when I can look and I'll have chats and I find people."
"11088380","11094740"," I mean, for me on the west coast, but when it's like one, two in the morning on the east"
"11094740","11097220"," coast and there's still people out there doing stuff."
"11097480","11098660"," It's like you're a futures trader. "
"11098980","11099260"," Yeah."
"11099440","11101660"," That or you got insomnia or have some other sleep issues."
"11102040","11106960"," So, so last night I actually went to sleep sitting on some puts, but most of the time, like last"
"11106960","11108180"," night, I'm like, I can't do this. "
"11108180","11109100"," I'm not doing this tonight."
"11109120","11114680"," But if I'm ever holding something overnight and I'm like, you know, my stress is going and I'm"
"11114680","11115080"," panning."
"11115080","11117960"," I get on fin to it like three in the morning, two in the morning. "
"11118120","11121580"," It's like there's like a group of people awake during the day."
"11122120","11126300"," And if they're awake at two, three in the morning, I'm like these, I'm like these fucking guys are"
"11126300","11128000"," long right now or short right now."
"11128080","11129560"," They're catching themselves right now. "
"11130160","11133260"," You can kind of tell who's because they're like not sleeping."
"11133260","11135320"," These are like cash market day traders."
"11135860","11138660"," And I'm like, Oh, these guys are these guys are long or short overnight. "
"11138660","11142940"," They're trying to heads and they're up at one, two in the morning, trying to protect their position"
"11142940","11145080"," with me right now and fin to it wild."
"11145780","11146300"," It is."
"11147280","11148200"," Yeah, no, absolutely. "
"11148480","11157620"," That's one of the reasons that I mean, I mean, I've got sleep issues of my own and I got"
"11157620","11162980"," tired of the just for me, the kind of the stress level of the options."
"11162980","11166580"," And don't get me wrong, I still trade options all the time."
"11166640","11174100"," I just don't talk about it actively because I know I'm a better futures trader on the my pivot"
"11174100","11175480"," supply resistance approach. "
"11176820","11182520"," And I, for me, this is just me personally, I don't have to worry about theta."
"11182800","11185980"," Yeah, I don't have to worry about things burning down to the ground."
"11186240","11189180"," If the market just kind of does whatever the hell it wants to. "
"11189640","11192660"," That was this just for me personally, that was a single thing."
"11192880","11193760"," It's so brutal."
"11194060","11198280"," It's so brutal trying to fight the algos and trying to fight the dealers and. "
"11198720","11199040"," Yeah."
"11200300","11202020"," You can be directly right, man."
"11202160","11203140"," You get smoked in this. "
"11203280","11204260"," We're going to smoke again."
"11204380","11204600"," Smoke."
"11204800","11206360"," I'm an 87 cents right now. "
"11206720","11208320"," And I'm in for like 93 or 94."
"11208700","11209860"," I'm down like five pennies."
"11210440","11211380"," But it doesn't matter. "
"11211620","11216060"," Like if we didn't have the interest right now, the IV right now in this event."
"11216060","11220980"," And I'd stayed in this training under any normal daily would have torched these things down like 20"
"11220980","11223240"," cents before you went to or supposed to go."
"11223660","11224140"," Yeah. "
"11224520","11224820"," Yeah."
"11225100","11226520"," At some point."
"11227120","11228400"," Before these breaks. "
"11229580","11234660"," I try to be a calm trader, but it's not in my wiring."
"11234660","11237360"," I'm not inherently wired to be a calm person."
"11237720","11241680"," So when things go against me, especially when it's like, I know I'm directionally right. "
"11242220","11244360"," And I'm still getting my ass kicked in the market."
"11244360","11244840"," Yeah."
"11245060","11245940"," I break things. "
"11246460","11250700"," So I just have to stop doing options on the major."
"11250860","11253620"," At least for long term stuff long term stuff."
"11253700","11254680"," I will still do some options. "
"11254680","11257540"," I'll do long term calendar spreads."
"11258100","11259140"," I hear all these painters."
"11259140","11260120"," They're like, I'm not emotional. "
"11260560","11262380"," I'm like, I'm this and I'm that."
"11262560","11264220"," I'm like, Oh, man, I've had some moments."
"11264640","11269200"," I've had moments where I've lost six figures and I broke that down to small pieces. "
"11269200","11272740"," You get in exactly you get enough money on the line."
"11273080","11274880"," And I don't like losing money period."
"11274880","11276000"," I don't care how much it is. "
"11276160","11277320"," So it's all against me."
"11277760","11281320"," And it's like I'm directionally right, but because of some other factor."
"11284080","11287460"," So that's how you know, so that might be largest loss I ever had. "
"11290100","11291620"," Well, we have to wrap this."
"11291840","11293100"," We have to wrap this interview up."
"11293160","11294720"," So first of all, we have a couple of things. "
"11295240","11295700"," First thing."
"11296540","11298400"," Largest trade, largest loss I ever had."
"11299840","11302020"," It was drinking the cool aid, man. "
"11302320","11304820"," And I'll never ever forgive myself for that again."
"11305040","11307420"," That's the that's what best was talking about."
"11308960","11310620"," We've only got a few minutes left here. "
"11313460","11317000"," What a first of all, follow and best go on Twitter if you can."
"11317240","11319940"," Cool guy posts a bunch of stuff on on Twitter insightful."
"11321540","11323400"," Moments like we're at a pivot in the market. "
"11323620","11323900"," He'll post."
"11325180","11327760"," He also puts out information every morning at night."
"11327760","11330820"," Sometimes you'll do a recap and then a review for the day. "
"11332440","11333660"," He does have a newsletter."
"11335480","11336960"," Oh, Jim, I will."
"11338360","11344000"," I'll post a couple of my, because I can do them as to the kind of the subscriber base, but"
"11344000","11344860"," I can make them public. "
"11345340","11345880"," I think I'll take."
"11346400","11349460"," I think I'll take the last one, at least one of the last one or two."
"11349880","11354180"," I'll make them public and share for everybody so they can kind of see what's what I'm telling folks"
"11354180","11355560"," behind the sauce, man. "
"11355560","11357620"," Yeah, let me get an idea who you are, what you're doing and."
"11358100","11360860"," Yeah, we've known each other since I got on on Fintuit."
"11360980","11362480"," I think a while ago, it's been a couple of years. "
"11362640","11363540"," I've known you at least, right?"
"11363900","11364300"," Yeah."
"11364740","11366380"," You and I have exchanged gone back and forth."
"11366600","11368940"," I think maybe three years now. "
"11369300","11371720"," It's definitely been some time that I've known."
"11371920","11374080"," I didn't want to put an exact date on it, but."
"11374600","11376140"," I've always appreciated your content. "
"11376140","11379060"," I've always taken this person, find him on Fintuit."
"11379200","11382760"," He's not, uh, he's not like, you know, pumping, dumping that kind of stuff."
"11383460","11386360"," We've got no agreements in the background or anything like that. "
"11386460","11389820"," It's a buddy of mine that I have on Fintuit and I've always appreciated them."
"11390500","11392880"," And, uh, so yeah, I'll catch up with you later."
"11394240","11399100"," Tell us what you want to talk about, maybe worse loss in the market or you want to talk about,"
"11399100","11403640"," uh, you want to point a finger up or down as if we're going up or we're going down. "
"11403900","11404420"," You want to do anything?"
"11406000","11407260"," Um, see, worse loss."
"11407660","11412040"," I wasn't six, but I was getting up there before I had to pull the plug."
"11412040","11414380"," Um, yeah. "
"11415140","11416120"," Um, and."
"11417520","11417780"," I'm."
"11419480","11425700"," Everything that I'm looking at from purely technical standpoint, as we're going to go higher, um,"
"11425880","11430580"," even stuff on like weekly and monthly basis says the stage is set to go higher. "
"11431140","11434480"," The problem is we've gone up and haven't had a breather."
"11434580","11435780"," We haven't had a pullback recently."
"11436920","11441500"," And Powell stepping up to the stage given all the shitty economy stuff going on. "
"11442020","11443180"," Scares the hell out of me."
"11443560","11443900"," So."
"11445000","11445940"," I don't know. "
"11446200","11447040"," I really don't know."
"11447180","11447900"," This is one of the effort."
"11448240","11450480"," This is one of the first effort in the season a long time. "
"11450480","11452600"," I don't know where the hell we're going to go."
"11453160","11456100"," Cause I've got conflicting things going on."
"11456560","11459860"," I got indicators and factors pointing up. "
"11460280","11464280"," And I have behind the scenes and fundamental economic data."
"11465060","11467540"," And I don't trust Powell and all that's pointing down."
"11467900","11470060"," So I honestly don't know where we're going. "
"11471180","11472340"," Yeah, I've got some."
"11472600","11475320"," I've got a tool that's telling me we're getting a leg."
"11475780","11479220"," So I was trying to show some people this morning that. "
"11480800","11482900"," We're either going to get a push off like a."
"11483200","11487420"," I just think if you're on like two books out in the ocean and a push you off here."
"11487420","11488960"," We're either going to get that or."
"11490340","11491860"," We might get a leg down. "
"11492280","11496940"," Mike Wilson seemed to confirm something like that this week to some extent."
"11497180","11499640"," He did a really good job of explaining it."
"11499640","11499960"," So. "
"11501340","11506700"," I'm interested to see actually where we go from here and for the market to find a direction for the"
"11506700","11508180"," next or for the rest of the quarter at least."
"11509440","11511960"," So check out in Vespa on FinTwit."
"11512140","11516220"," And Vespa, I appreciate your time for your showing up today to spend some time with us on FOMC Day. "
"11516740","11517180"," Yeah."
"11517460","11517920"," No, any time."
"11518100","11519660"," Thanks for the opportunity. "
"11520180","11523020"," I'm going to stick around and listen to Joe because I know he and I have."
"11524500","11525760"," Chatted a handful of times."
"11525760","11528880"," So you guys will probably see more of a Vespa at some point down the road. "
"11528880","11533500"," We'll we'll talk about that more later and in Vespa talk to you soon brother."
"11533840","11534400"," All right."
"11534720","11534920"," Thanks. "
"11535120","11535840"," Take a guy."
"11537340","11538140"," All right."
"11538260","11540000"," Let me see if I can figure out how to do this here. "
"11541680","11542680"," I got to try to."
"11543280","11544020"," All right."
"11544180","11545100"," So we disconnect the call. "
"11547320","11549040"," We're going to take a hold on here."
"11549160","11551420"," Get some stuff to do in the background that I can't figure out here."
"11552660","11555280"," And I'm kind of not really the. "
"11559230","11560990"," Let's see what I got going on here."
"11562650","11563130"," Okay."
"11563210","11564630"," I'm going to meet that right there. "
"11565170","11565770"," All right."
"11567330","11568570"," What's going on in the market?"
"11568710","11569710"," Has anything changed now?"
"11569890","11570510"," Not really, huh?"
"11570870","11571690"," I wasn't really paying attention."
"11572130","11573650"," I was kind of focused on a Vespa. "
"11574210","11575930"," So I've known him for some time."
"11576730","11577990"," Always insightful guy."
"11578250","11579790"," Always there at the right moments. "
"11581250","11585650"," When you want someone there posting, he might he might be a guy for you to check out."
"11585910","11589150"," He said he's going to post some of his stuff for everybody."
"11589270","11590130"," Just view for free. "
"11590850","11593010"," So even if you don't like the stuff, right?"
"11593770","11594290"," You don't have to."
"11594530","11599890"," You don't have to say I'm going with a Vespa, but the cool part is like for myself, I've spent"
"11599890","11602710"," time under many different people's tutelage, right?"
"11603930","11607370"," You meet a guy out there and he's like, Hey man, I like what you're doing."
"11607570","11608830"," You're fucking this all up. "
"11608830","11609210"," Captain."
"11609270","11609990"," You suck at this."
"11610330","11611910"," Let me spend a few minutes with you. "
"11611990","11613590"," Let me spend the next six months with you."
"11613730","11620370"," You know, funny thing is, you know, that guy, uh, always, uh, he, he graces me with his time"
"11620370","11621950"," outside of normal market hours."
"11622190","11623650"," He'll call me in the middle of the night. "
"11624170","11626650"," And he's like, you have no fucking idea what you're doing on this."
"11626730","11628770"," Let me explain this better to you, right?"
"11628950","11630370"," So I listened to him, right?"
"11630610","11631510"," Talk to me about markets."
"11632570","11637930"," Um, so if you're out there and you don't have anyone, uh, that you spend time with, I always"
"11637930","11640010"," recommend that you get into a group of people. "
"11640010","11641990"," You try to soak it up like a sponge."
"11642350","11646630"," If someone takes a shine to you and you're like, all right, I'm going to talk to this guy."
"11646730","11649070"," You don't have to agree with everybody, someone, everything someone says. "
"11649890","11652210"," Uh, but that's a key part of your trading journey."
"11652210","11656650"," Key part of your investing journey is to, uh, let me see me turn this down now for a minute."
"11656950","11661770"," Key part of your trading and investing journey is to, um, be able to make connections with people"
"11661770","11667590"," or other retailers and, uh, and kind of like get the tools from them, right?"
"11667750","11669410"," They're like, I'm successful with this. "
"11669530","11670850"," This stuff works for me over here."
"11670950","11672050"," You might be like, ah, that's not for me."
"11672610","11674350"," I'm a part of that might be for you. "
"11674730","11679350"," And you're, you're gaining exposure to people out there that are, they're like, Hey man, this works"
"11679350","11680270"," for me, right?"
"11680510","11681830"," This works for me all the time."
"11682390","11684990"," Uh, and at least you have the exposure to that, right?"
"11685410","11686730"," That's a very hard thing to get."
"11687010","11691990"," You're not going to get that from like, uh, from like some service that you pay for with tool. "
"11692450","11696310"," You're not going to get that from an alpha person that shows up for you once a week."
"11696570","11699730"," You're not going to get that from, um, uh, I don't know."
"11699830","11703530"," I'm looking at, uh, unusual, uh, options data, right?"
"11703770","11710090"," I'm not going to get that stuff from, um, uh, moving average or from me drawing a box, right"
"11710090","11710670"," underneath. "
"11710810","11712330"," Like this is where we think demand is."
"11712530","11717350"," We think supply is you want to really like get in with somebody and be like, Hey, you know, how"
"11717350","11717850"," do we do this?"
"11717930","11718670"," Or how do you do this?"
"11718670","11720690"," Or, uh, how do you manage a loss?"
"11720690","11723190"," How do you manage a win when you take money off?"
"11723950","11725510"," Um, that kind of stuff, right?"
"11725670","11726010"," What do you drink?"
"11726130","11726590"," You drink beer."
"11726710","11727230"," You drink bourbon. "
"11728010","11730590"," Um, try to, try to form a relationship."
"11730730","11735890"," Those relationships will tend to last for years, even if you move on to the next friend, uh, if"
"11735890","11736930"," you're like, Hey, this is my buddy."
"11736930","11737410"," I've met him. "
"11737410","11739430"," I've spent time with him and now we just say hi to each other."
"11740330","11744970"," Uh, it's a part of, part of this, uh, what you're doing or what we're doing and what you're doing,"
"11744970","11745210"," right?"
"11746030","11750130"," Uh, you make those lifelong connections with people and you come back and ask them when it's an"
"11750130","11751270"," important moment for you."
"11751570","11753370"," They're like, Hey man, I have a question for you. "
"11753430","11755730"," My mind is all fucked up right now."
"11756250","11758370"," I'm just coming back to find out what your thoughts are on this."
"11758530","11760590"," Am I just, you know, am I running around a hamster whale?"
"11760810","11762270"," Do I just let it cool off a little bit?"
"11762690","11763610"," That kind of stuff. "
"11764190","11765370"," Uh, let's check out a Vesqua."
"11765690","11767830"," Next up, we got Joe Donut."
"11768910","11771530"," We're going to see if we can, uh, get Joe Donut up here. "
"11771590","11772710"," You guys got any questions for me?"
"11776310","11779330"," Yeah, it always goes off on movies like one o'clock in the morning."
"11779330","11779670"," I agree."
"11784030","11785690"," I got, uh, five more minutes. "
"11785750","11788930"," I'm going to have, I'm going to start working on Joe, getting Joe Donut in here."
"11789310","11792310"," If you guys have any questions for me in the chat, I'll try to answer them for you briefly."
"11792550","11794470"," I think we've gone on over everything for today. "
"11794810","11797770"," Looks like the, uh, markets in a holding pattern at this moment."
"11797810","11798690"," We're below the pivot."
"11799330","11802950"," Uh, so we're at a negative, uh, hunched over stance for the market. "
"11803670","11805750"," We know that we, I think it's 2 p.m., right?"
"11805910","11807130"," We got two and two 30, I think."
"11808310","11809430"," Let me take a look here."
"11809670","11810990"," Make sure I got my times right. "
"11811290","11813350"," Unless they change something I don't know about."
"11815970","11816970"," Take a look right here."
"11818070","11821950"," You have the fed funds rate at 2 p.m. I'll snap a little line over here for you. "
"11822030","11823690"," See, we don't get too caught up in the market."
"11824390","11825750"," Uh, what do we got here?"
"11826190","11826570"," Two o'clock."
"11827970","11829410"," Probably pinned right now, right?"
"11829570","11829830"," And two. "
"11830770","11831350"," I'm going to try it."
"11831470","11835090"," Wait, my hope here is that the shorts try to come off the market here."
"11835490","11837010"," And that's why I'm staying long here. "
"11837010","11838690"," So we got 2 p.m. for the announcement."
"11839550","11842550"," We've got the, uh, we'll set this up for you guys so you understand."
"11843190","11847230"," I'm going to have a new squawk that's going to stay on here in the background. "
"11847690","11849390"," So it's right now, it's a 1256."
"11850150","11851330"," I'm going to put the new squawk."
"11851330","11852030"," It's on now. "
"11852410","11857250"," They'll give us the fed announcement or the, um, or the, uh, the press release."
"11857710","11861730"," And then we'll have the presser at 2 30 p.m. You should see two different reactions."
"11862590","11866430"," Uh, at those times at two, if you, whatever reaction you see at two. "
"11866890","11871150"," You're going to get a different reaction or a magnified reaction at two 30."
"11871570","11874410"," Uh, so I've got these two lines in here for you to take a look at."
"11874670","11875550"," As we get closer. "
"11877030","11879550"," I'm going to air right there for the initial reaction."
"11879790","11882650"," Something like this is what I'm looking for unless it's something ugly."
"11882790","11883650"," That's something that we don't know. "
"11884210","11885570"," Uh, I'm looking for this hour."
"11885730","11886490"," I think this is the hourly."
"11886710","11887570"," I'm going to check it right now. "
"11887650","11888450"," Make sure I got that right."
"11888930","11892730"," So the hourly is, uh, 40409."
"11893510","11895210"," I'm going to make this bigger here. "
"11895730","11897070"," I'm actually going to get rid of this 402."
"11899330","11901970"," And I'm going to, you get, this is your hourly trigger right here."
"11902550","11902790"," Okay. "
"11903070","11903710"," Right here."
"11905170","11906330"," That's your hourly trigger."
"11907510","11910730"," Uh, spy has, uh, some resistance above it. "
"11911450","11911930"," 40454."
"11914410","11915310"," Right here."
"11916190","11916670"," 40454. "
"11919390","11921450"," I don't, maybe I don't have this right here."
"11922370","11923010"," That's right."
"11925570","11926050"," 40458. "
"11927790","11929350"," Oh, we're looking to squeeze, baby."
"11931110","11932550"," We're looking to squeeze here."
"11936400","11938160"," And type for just a second. "
"11939040","11940520"," We're going to clean some of this stuff out."

"13705850","13710910"," in a position long let's they were going up in the presser and everything's honky-dory and then at"
"13710910","13716090"," the end of that presser you'll get the hard questions and we'll just start dumping so don't think"
"13716090","13721230"," don't consider yourself out of the woods it's usually the time period of the day like between right"
"13721230","13727070"," right after the presser like 230 get the presser and then like 245 I'm like I'm closed because they"
"13727070","13731830"," throw our monkey wrench in right at the end so just just be conscious of that we're gonna head back"
"13731830","13738770"," what Joe was saying what Stephen was saying Christian was saying was how do you identify companies"
"13738770","13745890"," that are expect growth in tech that's the next Tesla and surprisingly there's a group of us there's"
"13745890","13752470"," Joe Harper there's Quinn there's Chad's whole bunch of people out there I want to say about a group"
"13752470","13758750"," of five 10 people and we look for these companies behind closed doors you'll see me post them on"
"13758750","13763670"," Fintuit you'll see Joe post them and we're look we're typically we're looking for companies that"
"13763670","13772090"," are three years or less than IPO right there's two years or less of an IPO we're also making sure"
"13772090","13777990"," that they're 30% profits here every year but they have consistently good guidance and we're not"
"13777990","13786470"," trying to catch a night so we try to find these companies we post them as potential new Teslas or"
"13786470","13793930"," new next next next cycle tech companies and we track these companies we track them for their moves"
"13793930","13798890"," and we also are looking for the banks to be actively buying them regardless of the markets going up"
"13798890","13805070"," or going down and then on that point if the Christians wondering this question or if you out there"
"13805070","13811610"," wondering about this question when we identify those and post those publicly normally we're"
"13811610","13817410"," searching for them when the market is on fire and that would be the one tool or key point that"
"13817410","13826550"," I would say to you is you're trying to identify a spectrum company that's recently IPO there you"
"13826550","13830510"," look at all their fundamentals they're banging the banks are buying them and let's say the markets"
"13830510","13836230"," just just bloodbath in it that's the time when you go seeking those companies out for me at least"
"13836230","13840430"," especially in this market as it is right you find that to be the same thing Joe or do you"
"13841070","13846850"," absolutely you look for these companies no I mean that's that's it like I'm looking for especially"

"13884430","13891190"," all of them was they printed right so they were they were on cyclical paths that were ascending to"
"13891190","13899470"," their you know to the right they were had predictable earnings and ebbs and flows over a year so"
"13899470","13908470"," you could see in three years after their IPO initial pop and drop kind of a a predictable path"
"13908470","13916790"," where you could buy and spread you know at a bottom and no skeletons right yeah no skeletons in"
"13916790","13922650"," their closet they're just growing and making profits and so you know someone asked in the chat"

"13944510","13951310"," really interesting technology but is a trade for you know the type of money-maker growth companies"
"13951310","13956550"," that we were investing in it wouldn't have passed muster just because they're in a down channel"

"13964390","13970310"," don't know since May of 2022 there's a new lower low that just recently happened again so until"
"13970310","13976030"," they make higher lows on their major moves and then a higher high on a major move and get"
"13976030","13980270"," predictable in a channel that wouldn't be the kind of investment that I'll be comfortable making"
"13980270","13987350"," and not the kind of investment that you were not saying anything about the company oh shit yeah oh"

"14115040","14123760"," on on my screen I'm looking at it since their IPO after they broke off of Intel MBLY it was"
"14123760","14132980"," a spin-off from Intel after they acquired them right after Tesla fired them as their"
"14132980","14141140"," their provider for full self-driving but they spun them off probably because honestly Intel could"
"14141140","14151100"," really use the cash so and mobilize got contracts with a lot of yeah I mean they've been a rocket"
"14151100","14165900"," ship since their IPO are they profitable let's see they lose"
"14165900","14173840"," money per share currently yeah they don't come up on my man they don't come up on my screener I"
"14173840","14180260"," mean my biggest worry with the IPO like this is you know generally they go up and then they come"
"14180260","14184720"," back down and when they come back down it's because the banks have gotten enough people to take"
"14184720","14191880"," their you know their launch liquidity that they provided at the IPO and you know they're getting"
"14191880","14199040"," their money out very rarely do banks state in after an IPO or at least don't stay in it you"
"14199040","14205520"," know they could get 85% out after they get their money when they when they assist with IPOs like"
"14205520","14209500"," you watch them they just drain it they drain it and then they'll go to their employees drain it too"
"14209500","14215660"," right without the ever fixings them when they can sell yeah yeah I mean yeah you get the whole the"
"14215660","14221940"," the lockout periods big spire and then they all exit or a bunch of them exit some yeah everybody"
"14221940","14229340"," leaves a little in but the the worry with a launched IPO that went in November being up you know"
"14229340","14234620"," I don't know what the IPO but on day one their candles were pretty like in the in the mid"
"14234620","14244220"," 20s now they're up double so I don't know I don't know nothing about it we keep we'll take a"
"14244220","14249940"," look at it right now I'll bring up a chart on him real quick and let me see if we"
"14249940","14258090"," have some time here to do this the for myself for where we are in the market"
"14258090","14267430"," I tend to have a very high yeah I can't this is this is a great ticker if you're by"
"14267430","14276150"," the by the the launch on it I'd be looking to be a buyer again at like 2569 I wouldn't"
"14276150","14281670"," want to just worry that now yeah you just worry that you'd be exit liquidity for banks you know"
"14281670","14288150"," they're there with a growth with an explosion like that and it only being about a quarter and a"
"14288150","14294950"," half ago you know there's a high likelihood the banks would be still looking to get out after"
"14294950","14299810"," doubling their money right so you get there they double their money they look at the get out"
"14299810","14306270"," usually so you know that's and then you end up shorting it down to you know it opened up at"
"14306270","14313470"," 25 26 bucks probably the original buyers are probably down in the five bucks $1 shit like that"
"14313470","14319530"," which is kind of ready to say but you know you started opening it up to the big boys and"

"21159190","21164570"," about the JPM call we're gonna talk about that again we reviewed it yesterday and the day before in"
"21164570","21173330"," detail so how the caller is made is this the intent behind the caller is twofold or two or"
"21173330","21181750"," threefold I guess the caller is intended to limit the market's ability to go up or down but trade"
"21181750","21190230"," within a range through the options market so the idea here is this is that they made their money on"
"21190230","21199550"," the call side and now they funded the downside protection excuse me so let's say we trade to four"
"21199550","21208610"," zero six zero right they're trying to attempt now from us from going up in the magnet below with"
"21208610","21214490"," that being said if we have call expansion in the market the puts are free so it's okay if we"
"21214490","21219550"," go up from here for JPM they don't care if we go up if we go down they just make"
"21219550","21225970"," more money they just make extra money okay now if we get call expansion if we get bought real money"
"21225970","21231370"," buying in the market they've already made their money they just have free that their hedges done so"
"21231370","21237350"," they'll hold that hedge to expiry into the 31st for downside protection do you I don't know if I'm"
"21237350","21242830"," going to explain that exactly right we have them we still the magnet down below right that protects"
"21242830","21250670"," their lungs as we go higher at the same time it tries to limit upside rips right they don't they"
"21250670","21255390"," don't want to see the market swing way high swing way low but that doesn't mean the market can't"
"21255390","21260510"," continue to grind higher literally if this market gets bought for the rest of this quarter you'll"
