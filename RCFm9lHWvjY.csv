"5640","7100"," All right, good morning."
"9480","14520"," Check one, two, mic check."
"27830","38470"," Check one,"
"38870","39030"," two. "
"41310","44170"," Even his face is all cut to the side."
"57100","60440"," One minute remaining, I'll leave with the US S&P manufacturing PMI."
"98250","99030"," Ten seconds. "
"104710","105650"," What up, Bill?"
"105950","106610"," Oh, golf day."
"109350","109870"," 40."
"110010","111490"," Did we get rain this morning?"
"111790","118130"," The forecast is 4.5 US S&P services PMI flash 54 spot one, 50 four spot one, hiding the"
"118130","124510"," forecast of 54, composite PMI flash 53, 53, low in the forecast of 53 spot five, seeing it with a"
"124510","127289"," website, a website, whoops soaring, apologies in the Dixie. "
"131470","132850"," See what I got going on here."
"133530","134510"," There's a couple things I got to do here."
"138420","139900"," Just flip it right in right now. "
"140360","142340"," Just one quick second area, a couple things I got to do."
"143840","145640"," It's like getting this show up some mornings."
"147080","152660"," I can't I have to shut down my setup right. "
"152900","158100"," So, well, first it's really hot right now, so I'm shutting down my office every night fully."
"159580","169480"," And when I turn it back on, it uh, listen here to resets"
"169480","169920"," everything."
"172300","176080"," Windows 11 wants to reassign a bunch of stuff every day. "
"177300","186040"," I'm turning it off because my HVAC in my house is not completely set up to deal with the heat."
"187060","190800"," So, I've got a series of fans now blowing air air into this room."
"196450","204890"," So, then the time that it takes me to get the get ready in the morning is it's like taking"
"204890","206670"," me 45 minutes to an hour every morning. "
"212350","217630"," So, all the screeners that I have up all, everything that I have up after re-opin, re-organize,"
"217830","219010"," make sure everything is where it's supposed to be."
"221980","224660"," And we got rain last night, so"
"224660","237960"," let's"
"239660","249600"," pick up some cool, um, well, first of all, the selling"
"249600","249980"," overnight."
"250700","253020"," Let's look at the selling that happened that occurred overnight. "
"254240","255060"," Start there."
"255399","256700"," First of all, good morning to you."
"256740","257279"," Happy Friday. "
"257980","258440"," Happy summer."
"258579","258980"," Happy Friday."
"262800","264440"," Damn, I almost bought this too. "
"264740","268180"," I almost bought this open right here a few minutes ago and I didn't."
"268360","271000"," I was, well, first I was busy and I was like, I'm not going to buy that shit."
"272400","274980"," Here's the collar down here that we've been talking about, right?"
"275320","276080"," Here's your collar. "
"277520","278880"," Here's the same thing."
"279120","280660"," Kevin Jim James, price target."
"280660","281840"," I've been looking at that all week long. "
"284460","286000"," So, I'm going to mute this for a minute here."
"291200","292860"," Some of this clothes last night."
"294400","297980"," We got above the hourly trigger and that clothes rest nice. "
"299020","302380"," So, yesterday, I think we, I don't, Winky told me that he took some off."
"302580","309300"," I took, I took, I think, 75 contracts off last night here, but I left 25 contracts on here."
"309720","311200"," They're fucking smoked this morning. "
"311340","313020"," They're like three pennies or something like that."
"313680","320760"," I took some at 51 cents into this bell, but even so, many other times."
"321120","323160"," So yesterday, yesterday is a show, right?"
"323900","325540"," I was like, yeah, we're above the hourly trigger. "
"325700","326760"," We're going to trade all this up here."
"326840","334380"," And eventually, next week, the collars should tractor beam us down into that, into the 30th."
"335100","336600"," They're not even waiting for that. "
"337120","338740"," They're just like, fuck you or short."
"341440","347040"," JPM is just like, I mean, Marco came out yesterday and said, remember yesterday, I was like, you"
"347040","347580"," don't have any news."
"347740","348880"," You need to create some news. "
"349840","357840"," And sure enough, this morning, I'm reading stories from Marco saying unknown unknowns."
"358060","360740"," So I'm like, what the fuck is unknown unknowns?"
"360820","361540"," That's bullshit."
"362640","368020"," And then I read another story of this morning that said, don't like something like, don't overthink"
"368020","368260"," it. "
"368520","372140"," And I'm like, I know exactly what the fuck it is to fucking JPM caller."
"372300","374780"," And they're going to be short this to limit."
"375140","379480"," They're going to be short the call side to limit exposure, right?"
"379640","380620"," Our losses, I guess. "
"382400","387520"," I figured we'd have until at least, I don't know, maybe Monday of next week, but you can see the"
"387520","390860"," impact and effect of it this morning."
"391120","392700"," So they're not going to hold this here."
"392800","395180"," They're going to fucking sell as much as they possibly can. "
"395600","396660"," This is not dealer."
"396880","398580"," This is JPM, Gary and fucking teeter."
"398660","399660"," At least in my view, it is. "
"400600","402240"," Now, they just don't give a fuck, right?"
"402500","403480"," And they can't do it in cash."
"403780","405400"," They're going to do it in the overnight hours."
"407520","409160"," This is most definitely a bank. "
"410420","411620"," In my view, at least."
"412520","417080"," No, we should look back at we're going to look back at something here."
"418040","419260"," So we can go to a four hour here. "
"421100","422400"," When was December?"
"425020","427060"," Right in here, this time period right here."
"428880","431600"," Just so you can see this time period here, right?"
"431740","435020"," They came right in and they parked the this called parking the bus, right?"
"435280","438860"," And the quarter end of quarterly opex."
"439060","441460"," That's just kind of grinding into the end of the month. "
"441520","445560"," So where's the first somewhere in here?"
"446180","449760"," And I'm going to expect at least something like that."
"450580","459000"," There's a possibility they could get it lower due to the collar, but people will attack the collar."
"459000","461780"," Of course, we know that too, but we're right at it. "
"461900","462140"," Where's that?"
"462240","463180"," Let's go to SPX."
"473140","475460"," Now, here's the collar right here for 30."
"475780","476740"," It's 4320. "
"477020","478900"," Don't don't mind the 17 cents."
"480820","482520"," So now talk about parking the bus."
"483080","486560"," You know that we're not holding the six EMA is a four hour chart. "
"491640","493120"," But we're not going to hold that right."
"493280","497060"," So any gains they're going to short the fuck out of into in a month."
"497160","500240"," When we talked about it happening next week, they don't care. "
"500500","502420"," Just like fuck you, we're not doing it."
"503560","504780"," And we're going to magnet."
"506520","511400"," Now even saying that we're going to magnet SPX here, right?"
"514340","515960"," Here's your magnet right here. "
"517059","520419"," We'll still trade the we should trade the entire area."
"520460","525780"," So I wouldn't be I wouldn't be surprised if we even traded lower."
"532920","540080"," So if you look back on that, if you look back on that, it wouldn't shock me to see a"
"540080","541900"," cent where where's 30th. "
"544960","549060"," Like we got rain last night of now, I've got like allergies."
"550300","553940"," There's some cool though that I this morning right there."
"556060","559120"," So you end up seeing this like, you know, this is 432. "
"559400","561660"," Let's make this clean this up a little bit."
"567610","571570"," So if this is your magnet right here, make that our magnet."
"576290","579050"," You know, there's a bit of like into the 30th. "
"579830","581070"," This kind of a trade."
"582870","584230"," People will try to attack it."
"584230","591730"," But even if they do, it should revert back into the 30th, dude, I wouldn't shock me to see us"
"591730","594830"," pin like 4320 right on the 30th too. "
"596310","600810"," So I figured we'd have figured to have at least until next week and then we get that drop."
"601090","606050"," I think I said yesterday, Wednesday, Thursday, we got a couple big nasty days to get down there."
"606310","609590"," I figured we'd get down there, but they're just like, fuck you, it's that's happening right now. "
"610050","614310"," So that's what at least my view that's happening earlier than I anticipated."
"614790","615310"," So I'm wrong."
"616590","618230"," You're just like, go fuck yourself. "
"618850","620950"," And there's your trade right there."
"621370","629290"," With that said, if there is any pull to the upside here, or if we're even in the middle here,"
"629550","634970"," some kind of a fly into OPEC's might be a good trade."
"635170","639010"," I was talking to Winky this early this morning and I was like, maybe it's time to put a collar"
"639010","641750"," on, not a collar, but a butterfly into next Friday. "
"646000","647280"," Well, for that close."
"647760","649120"," Let me know in the chat what you think about that."
"650220","655120"," I figured we'd trade this man and have like a nice, like violent fucking Wednesday, Thursday of"
"655120","655540"," next week. "
"655580","657720"," And it's just like, fuck, you know, we're selling this down."
"657940","661980"," And then the stories that I read this morning, it's saying the same thing."
"662220","663700"," So don't ever think it. "
"664080","665920"," They're not telling you why it is."
"667140","668580"," You know, it's weird too."
"669060","675360"," There's another aspect to this to think about, which is what was a couple of aspects to think"
"675360","675580"," about. "
"675900","683520"," First one is if we were in a bull market, like a real bull market, not a bull run, we"
"683520","685180"," can overrun this."
"686440","693820"," We can overrun it just during daytime cash market hours, RTH hours, we'll sell violently at"
"693820","698460"," nighttime, but we can continue higher."
"698860","707900"," So this does say a little bit to or it points a little bit towards is this bull market sustainable?"
"708360","710160"," It says probably not, right?"
"710840","714480"," We'll probably still have that failure trying to get all time highs. "
"714900","721060"," Or even if we were a clip sit, we still have another huge down move coming either way."
"722520","726660"," So this does point somewhat towards the collar working."
"726660","734300"," If we're in a real like strong bull market, like we've got a QE, that kind of stuff, we can"
"734300","735500"," blow right past this stuff. "
"735640","736360"," It makes no difference."
"736520","737540"," It just becomes more violent."
"737820","740900"," It's like, bam, bam, well, bam, bam all the way up. "
"741900","747580"," So this does lend a little bit of insight to the idea that whatever bull run bull market this is,"
"747580","749740"," it's not the kind, it's not the real one, right?"
"750340","752140"," It's not a new, a new debt cycle."
"752160","754960"," It's not new cycle of QE, anything like that."
"755120","759900"," So you can glean that from this pulling down effect that we're having right now. "
"760400","767420"," Another fascinating part about where we are right now heading into next week would be where to"
"767420","771840"," anticipate those strikes, the upper and the lower strikes to be."
"772500","781520"," So if we're at 432 here, figure out, I don't know, 5% higher, maybe"
"781520","785380"," three, let's call it 4%."
"786040","789080"," Probably measure, let me take a look right now and see what that measure would be. "
"792060","793360"," Let's take a look at it."
"794220","799480"," So if we tag SPX432, we can measure that."
"803300","805180"," We're going to look at Rivian this morning as well. "
"805500","807140"," Someone in the discord was asking about it."
"807820","808860"," I think I'll look at Rivian."
"808940","812380"," I know it's been on the topic of, I know it's been on everybody's topic of conversation. "
"820320","821920"," Just a second here, I'll measure this."
"829360","830060"," Oh, no."
"842600","852040"," So 3%, 3% puts us at 4449. "
"853880","856520"," So 445 would be an upside target."
"856520","863340"," And 5% is"
"866570","876550"," 4536, 4536 on SPX"
"876550","887320"," 4536 and 446."
"887820","890960"," So the upside target here is not that much higher. "
"890960","902290"," You're talking about, you know,"
"902370","906710"," something like this, much farther out, actually, it's a one-hour chart."
"908830","912750"," Let's call it, um, let's say, 456."
"916610","917650"," Let me get that right. "
"924270","924830"," 4448."
"927290","932950"," This is, I'd have to get better math, but generally, right around there."
"934210","944690"," So that would be, these would be upside targets into the end of September, right"
"947030","947330"," there. "
"948870","958000"," So if you're bullish into, this is your current target right here."
"962880","965000"," To call our current JPM caller."
"968790","976090"," So just like not looking at a five-minute chart, that's your current target for the 30th right"
"976090","976330"," here. "
"978270","983390"," And when they go to put their caller on, unless there's something we don't know, you know, and you"
"983390","985080"," can see this right here into it, right?"
"985720","987520"," Down into there, tag it up here."
"988720","995700"," And, you know, I actually like the idea of July being, or maybe the 5th, come back in the 5th,"
"995880","999140"," we have that week, July, and then we make our way up."
"1000200","1006460"," But some people say, you know, expect September to start to be at downs, like, so you get to get"
"1006460","1013880"," something like this, move up, and then you're down into, I'm assuming the next caller strike will"
"1013880","1014040"," be. "
"1014700","1015600"," Somewhere in there."
"1017280","1020760"," So your, your, um, what's your top strike right now?"
"1020760","1025040"," I guess we could go really fucking big and then come down into the caller right here."
"1026740","1030200"," It could be a, it could be if we get, if we're able to get up there, it could be"
"1030200","1031240"," a huge run. "
"1033300","1039420"," Then bam, you hit your target into something like that, 470, 460."
"1040640","1043599"," That would be your failure at all time highs for Q3."
"1044420","1045839"," That's kind of crazy, right?"
"1045980","1051980"," Even to think about that, you get some kind of a giant move into, uh, beginning of September, and"
"1051980","1052940"," they sell this off. "
"1054680","1056200"," That's if we hit the top strike."
"1057600","1061680"," Uh, so we're gonna hit that top, like, we just, this is exactly what we just did right here."
"1062360","1069480"," So if this was the top strikes somewhere in here, the caller is going to be important wherever"
"1069480","1074440"," that, wherever that top caller is, you're talking about, and there's that four, six, that's at all"
"1074440","1075300"," time highs, right?"
"1076620","1083380"," Then you slam down into this heading into September 30th. "
"1084180","1086480"," So we're going to have to pay close attention to this."
"1087160","1089660"," Whatever this top strike is going to be important."
"1091300","1097020"," Uh, if they don't raise the strikes, if they keep it down here somewhere, you could begin to expect"
"1097020","1099800"," a move lower and then something like that. "
"1101600","1109440"," So the 30th is going to be important to find out what those strikes are for end of next quarter."
"1113260","1115560"," Hey, Lincoln, did you grab IWM in the bell this morning?"
"1116340","1117100"," I didn't look out of yet."
"1120290","1121410"," A nice call, brother. "
"1122290","1124690"," Like you said, buy IWM around the opening bell this morning."
"1128940","1130300"," All right, so back to Spa."
"1130520","1132320"," You guys got at least an idea on the caller. "
"1136490","1143390"," Back to the spoos, we've got a giant, a gap above between 434 and 99."
"1148010","1149690"," Am I still have work, you got to do this morning."
"1149850","1152750"," So I'm going to get out of here in just a minute and leave the stream up, but I'll stop"
"1152750","1156510"," back in here and there you'll see me on camera, but I got work, I got to do. "
"1159050","1162970"," Yeah, that one right there, you got this pre-market bullshit down here."
"1164330","1168090"," That pre-market, or that's the pre-market low right there."
"1171350","1175770"," That top right there, one more right here. "
"1177930","1184590"," Hello, I'm gonna have to get some fucking calls here for first for Friday."
"1197150","1198190"," Is this one?"
"1198810","1199310"," There's the pivot."
"1211450","1212450"," Right, I'm in. "
"1215420","1217480"," Happy Friday fucking zero dates."
"1219120","1225680"," Also note that because it's Friday, tech doesn't tech, individual tech techers do not have"
"1226520","1231100"," individual tech techers do not have zero dates."
"1231460","1234280"," So zero date Friday for tech seems to be the play. "
"1235820","1241980"," Most Fridays, if we have a down Thursday, Friday being green is a very high likelihood."
"1243480","1244960"," So I'm in some calls for today."
"1245100","1245860"," Now I'm finally in. "
"1246940","1249500"," Got a bull plane forming right here."
"1251140","1253080"," See if it can confirm itself to the upside."
"1254040","1258120"," Try to take out that 436, 435, 658. "
"1258420","1260520"," I'm still in some 438s for today."
"1261000","1262220"," I never sold those off the bell."
"1262380","1263180"," They're worth like three cents. "
"1263400","1265700"," We'll see if we can at least capture some of that."
"1266200","1272080"," I'll be wary of going to 438 because what they'll do is they'll drag this down and murder all those"
"1272080","1273000"," 438s from yesterday."
"1273000","1280000"," Those will never print a high, high chance of not printing that 438 into today clothes. "
"1287110","1289250"," Okay, so here we go."
"1293160","1294100"," Right there."
"1296990","1298910"," We're going to look at Rivian this morning. "
"1299030","1301930"," I promised someone on Discord that I'd look at Rivian for him."
"1303370","1306250"," There's been a lot of like a discussion about Rivian."
"1306610","1308470"," Why is Rivian not going up?"
"1311790","1313490"," So we'll take a look at that briefly. "
"1313890","1317830"," And then I'm going to give you guys some shout outs on some individual tickers like we've been"
"1317830","1318110"," doing."
"1319110","1322250"," And matter of fact, first I'll start with those tickers."
"1323570","1326290"," And so you guys want to trade individual tickers today. "
"1326550","1327910"," We've been doing that all week long as well."
"1328130","1329530"," Seems like it's been working quite well."
"1331350","1332830"," Ever like, yeah, fuck the indexes. "
"1332850","1334730"," I want to trade a individual ticker."
"1335950","1337850"," We got a small list for you this morning."
"1338590","1338970"," Nice. "
"1342510","1344790"," They're still not paying me on this right here."
"1344870","1345790"," This is bullshit too."
"1346270","1348310"," Just gave me like two fucking pennies or something. "
"1349830","1350810"," Even on that squeeze."
"1351470","1355650"," Okay, so we're going to take a look at a few tickers here."
"1357470","1366380"," The first one we're going to look at is we can meet this really quick so we can get people"
"1366380","1367700"," on individual tickers. "
"1371970","1377010"," Traders move bets on a 6.25% bank of England peak to year end from February."
"1379450","1383490"," This is a LGM."
"1386390","1387890"," Time support at weekly trigger. "
"1390390","1392310"," Traded above, it's daily trigger."
"1393230","1395630"," It's on a five trigger cluster right now."
"1396310","1397650"," It's got it's weekly. "
"1398590","1400170"," Actually got the green boxes back here."
"1400670","1402270"," It was bought on it's hourly."
"1403010","1404390"," Price is above it's hourly right now. "
"1404410","1408730"," So you got the weekly, the daily and price above it's hourly."
"1409990","1410530"," Three trigger cluster."
"1411150","1417610"," One, two, three big fat bars as long as price remains above 41.87 this morning. "
"1418210","1419770"," The trade is to the upside."
"1421650","1423810"," It's been grinding higher and higher and higher."
"1424190","1426310"," It's looking, it's broken above right here. "
"1426570","1427690"," So it's got a nice gap to fill."
"1429190","1438700"," So some targets to the upside today would be 43.40. 44 "
"1438700","1441720",".83. I don't know if you get this full move today."
"1441720","1447640"," 47.78, but it's a nice place to start to go to 43.40 on ALGM. "
"1450160","1452740"," Next one is going to be S-Y-M."
"1452820","1453560"," We'll take a look at that one."
"1460470","1467030"," So just like that last ticker that I showed you, you might not want to enter this one, but it"
"1467030","1469130"," is the bottom of it's hourly trend right now. "
"1470470","1471570"," Let's see it down here."
"1473970","1481370"," Trade in 42.11, got the dip buy right there and it's daily."
"1482010","1483230"," Just keep your eye on this one. "
"1483510","1485490"," It has to stay above it's one in five minute."
"1487490","1490250"," So just right here, it has to stay above about $42."
"1490930","1493090"," There is some selling pressure above here. "
"1496290","1506010"," I can probably chart this one on, so note, no"
"1506010","1512090"," bueno below 39.44. And to be honest with you, it needs to stay above it's one in five."
"1512870","1517270"," So let's take a look at this one on quick, look at Sim."
"1523100","1525240"," So symbiotic right where it is right now. "
"1525280","1530440"," You see these buyers stepping in high volume this morning, high volume yesterday."
"1531800","1535340"," Bought the dip down here and they bought the dip right here."
"1535340","1552760"," There is a key note here though, which would be 39.44. Way"
"1552760","1563790"," down here, five minute"
"1563790","1564050"," chart. "
"1571330","1572810"," No go below here."
"1585590","1587850"," So buy stops, you can buy this if you like."
"1589370","1590710"," Your stops are below. "
"1593730","1613710"," There is one thing here is that one thing I want to say here would be 44.28. I"
"1613710","1614910"," might actually enter this myself."
"1615610","1616650"," I like this trade."
"1624810","1627730"," There being as long as price is above the five, you're good. "
"1628270","1633030"," You've got some flattening of the five and the 27 and the 129 is flattening at least."
"1635130","1637950"," But I still like the trade after."
"1641920","1649440"," If it does this, if I like the trade better, I kind of like it right now. "
"1649600","1654340"," It's risky, but kind of like the idea of this grinding in here."
"1657280","1663580"," Then this explosive move up here to try to close out some of these higher targets."
"1664600","1666500"," Look at that, those upper targets again. "
"1671020","1698580"," We got 45.98. This one"
"1698580","1699160"," looks really good."
"1702580","1704460"," It's already starting to pick up right now."
"1705180","1707780"," It's already being bought right now, so it's got a high volume on it. "
"1707880","1709320"," It's got its great ticker actually by the way too."
"1709960","1711540"," Symbiotic S-Y-M."
"1715480","1719320"," We're going to get an SMRT as well because that one was cranking yesterday I think. "
"1723950","1726230"," And it caught another dip by this morning."
"1726630","1728630"," So SMRT, so that one too."
"1729310","1730810"," There we go, S-Y-M's already moving. "
"1734390","1740990"," SMRT, we've been talking about this one a lot lately, caught a nice bounce down here on it's daily."
"1741550","1742250"," Bam, bam, bam."
"1742250","1744950"," Came right back up, bam, bam, cranked yesterday. "
"1745910","1748130"," And it caught a bounce again this morning off the bell."
"1748130","1754810"," So as long as price stays above $3.47, the move is to the upside."
"1756010","1758810"," Looks like they're buying this hourly and the daily all the way up. "
"1758950","1762690"," The target is $3.75 and I think we've got a higher target on it too."
"1763710","1765510"," I could be wrong on that, but I thought we did."
"1766010","1772170"," There are still sellers back here on that $3.75. This thing's going to make a move, man. "
"1772430","1776730"," If you look at this thing right here, this thing is going to make a move."
"1778130","1779790"," And I want to see it squeeze."
"1781170","1783130"," It's a nice squeeze play, man. "
"1783270","1788450"," It's like $5.53 and you see the selling here."
"1792770","1799890"," And it's all these trap buyers shorts right here, but if we can get above this $3.75 and that"
"1799890","1803030"," hourly comes up here and that daily comes up here, it could take a week."
"1803970","1807330"," But the target above is, you know, five and a half. "
"1808230","1809590"," That's a pretty big play."
"1809750","1810890"," It's like 70% or something."
"1813330","1815290"," Your weekly is coming along to help out. "
"1815970","1818470"," I think we get this in the next week, two weeks."
"1819650","1820950"," Keep your eye on SMRT."
"1826010","1827290"," Nice trading right now. "
"1827410","1831050"," Remember to remember when you're trading stuff like this, S-Y-M."
"1831610","1832510"," Blasting right now."
"1833590","1835610"," You're likely going to get a sell on this five minute. "
"1836050","1838930"," Come back down and you'll get to catch the white for the move higher."
"1842110","1844130"," So those are the three tickers for this morning."
"1844630","1846010"," I'll read them off to you one more time. "
"1846610","1851690"," ALGM, S-Y-M, and SMRT for zero date Fridays."
"1860960","1861860"," There's Spy."
"1863900","1865000"," You'll get IWM. "

"1921000","1921240"," erased. "
"1922320","1927530"," Still another full retracement."
"1927690","1931310"," I'm going to assume this is at least .68. Maybe a full retracement."
"1931430","1933010"," It's very close to a full retracement. "
"1933750","1935470"," I know why you want to go long in this shit."
"1937890","1942910"," I started above 183 on IWM today."
"1944270","1946610"," It's almost a full retracement of the whole move right there. "
"1948630","1950930"," Still like this red bar though down here."
"1951190","1952050"," Still like buying this."
"1955670","1958910"," I got out right here somewhere in there, 186. "
"1959250","1959990"," Yeah, I got out right there."
"1961130","1962350"," I took that trade down there."
"1964490","1969150"," I still like to see that down move into the first of the month, like July, and then come back"
"1969150","1969970"," down and buy it again. "
"1971830","1976010"," It's a rejection down there, something like that for IWM."
"1977310","1979950"," It's been the jam to buy down here, this red line right here."
"1980050","1980310"," See it?"
"1981850","1982750"," Right there. "
"1984350","1986330"," It's been my consistent printer."
"1987770","1989950"," Somewhere down there into July."
"1991070","1992890"," It's called like July 5th or something. "
"1996090","1997310"," Explosive move higher."
"1999050","2002800"," But even so, there's a trade there."
"2014650","2016230"," That's PT1 where you hit it. "
"2019310","2021690"," And I would expect your failure right here."
"2021890","2023470"," I don't think you get higher than 1A."
"2023590","2026410"," I said 1A3, 56, but I think it's 1A. "
"2026410","2027410"," I think this is your target error."
"2030350","2032470"," I don't think you get that high PT2."
"2045020","2047260"," There's some other gaps up there, but I think you failed these. "
"2061690","2064330"," Oh, so that's IWM for this one for you, Winky."
"2069010","2069630"," Oh, sweet."
"2072250","2073650"," Trading 73 now. "
"2074850","2075830"," They're not paying much."
"2076030","2077469"," Did I get these things in the money right now?"
"2077570","2077810"," They're not."
"2078469","2079710"," They're printing 74 cents. "
"2079710","2080570"," I got them at 66."
"2085989","2089790"," Bull cross right now for zero date Friday."
"2118080","2121780"," Put it on the end caps. "
"2123820","2127650"," One, right there."
"2130610","2132870"," It's up and down rejection."
"2155750","2162050"," So taking a look at the fear and greed index 75 out of 100 signaling extreme greed and the crypto"

"2233670","2234430"," I didn't lose any money."
"2237750","2239490"," It took six cents off of it."
"2242210","2243170"," They had more. "
"2243290","2243810"," I had 10."
"2249250","2253250"," I'm flat right now on those 434s."
"2280890","2286990"," They should get you should get Friday zero dates on all of these tech attack stocks. "
"2287090","2290030"," Anything man oversold should get zero date."
"2290290","2294590"," Call buying activity all the all morning channel."
"2305790","2308610"," High target for me would so you want to see right now. "
"2309250","2310210"," What's high target on spy."
"2310850","2314210"," So right now you're looking for a recheck here on the bull cross."
"2314510","2317310"," So this this bull plane right here you're going to get a check here. "
"2317670","2318430"," Come up here."
"2318530","2319810"," We check this if it holds."
"2320810","2324010"," You should see an upside target here to tag this PT one. "
"2324650","2327670"," Come back down then tag this PT two PT three."
"2328410","2329410"," Would be a stretch."
"2329870","2331510"," I think you get a failure in here somewhere. "
"2332770","2334930"," Some are in failure to close this gap."
"2334950","2338990"," So We'll see if this holds right here."
"2339470","2342630"," If this holds I will re-enter another trade to the upside. "
"2343030","2344170"," If you guys want to trade with you right now."
"2345010","2347690"," I know that you're probably probably probably risky for you to trade."
"2356750","2358090"," Just want to see if this holds. "
"2378170","2381250"," Do that 1334 on the fucking VIX huh."
"2383890","2386730"," Just don't fucking want to give that 1334 up."
"2387470","2388330"," Like a fucking magnet. "
"2402690","2404010"," I don't want to get trapped in here."
"2405750","2407830"," It's like right now I want to see a green bar."
"2409550","2410850"," So I don't want to get trapped in this. "
"2410950","2414450"," I want to see a green bar and then one red and green bar again was like green."
"2415490","2418570"," Red, green and then enter the trade right there."
"2435770","2437550"," I guess we got rain this morning. "
"2437810","2443350"," So yesterday I pulled out a tent and so I've got backpacking tents."

"4070970","4077730"," very simple trading now let's talk about something here let's talk about setups talk about bull"
"4077730","4085990"," planes and bear planes now and on multi time frames so if you're looking for bull planes and bear"
"4085990","4088970"," planes i'm going to show you a bull plane what a bull plane looks like what a bear plane looks"
"4088970","4097350"," like so this is the forming of a bull plane here okay right where we are right now show you"
"4097350","4107319"," guys a couple things give me a second i'm gonna line the support okay"
"4107319","4114300"," so a couple things uh this is the forming of a bull plane now it's not a bull plane yet"
"4114300","4120700"," but it looks like one there's some key things to remember about a bull plane and a bear plane both"
"4121540","4129620"," you never fuck around on like if i'm looking for a day trade you never fuck around in here this"
"4129620","4132620"," is i'll do it for the bear plane as well but you never fuck around in here this is the"
"4132620","4140760"," chop zone there's no confirmation that we're going up yet so what you're looking for is this"
"4140760","4149640"," pattern to play out really simple right here and right here and"
"4149640","4155960"," you're actually waiting for price you're not going to believe this but you're waiting for price to"
"4155960","4164380"," come in here squeeze up higher and then confirm the move higher so you don't actually your highest"
"4164380","4173220"," probability trade in this setup is right here this one prints uh like 90 percent of the time"
"4173220","4181660"," it's like prints every time it's like it's like 85 percent or something like that if this if this"
"4181660","4203180"," pattern works itself up chop zone in here this is also a place to trap bulls right"
"4203180","4220720"," you don't fuck that let's clean it all up this"
"4223250","4229350"," is also a place to trap bulls on the inverse it's a place to trap bears so this is this"
"4229350","4236310"," is grind and this is right now a place to trap uh bulls to the downside a lot of times"
"4236310","4240510"," you'll see bulls be like oh we're going up here i'm going to take this trade and they get trapped"
"4240510","4246210"," they let up losing two three four five trades in a row and they're not getting consistent wins"
"4246210","4252350"," right you can put together seven wins nine wins and you lose one two or three do that 10 20"
"4252350","4259250"," 30 40 times you're going to be winning trader if you are entering this trade too early you'll"
"4259250","4264950"," become like i lost five trades or i lost six trades or i lost uh seven trades only one three"
"4264950","4274650"," so there's these setups in here for you to be a more uh consistent winner now i'm going to show"
"4274650","4288910"," you the inverse of this as well for a bear shit"
"4288910","4300170"," there's a good one right here five minute chart here's the cross right here that's"
"4300170","4309490"," a bear plane white crossing over you see the confirmation right we trade down go up failure to get"
"4309490","4316170"," the new high up here right choke up choke them out twice and that's where you actually enter the"
"4316170","4321530"," trade right there the second one one two and then bam to the downside that's your trade and now"
"4321530","4331590"," that you're underneath that five ema you already know that you can tee off of this until we"

"4353230","4360110"," the four hour or we bullish or bearish on what time frame is there a higher likelihood that we'll"
"4360110","4369900"," sell so is this bearish uh"
"4369900","4374740"," not necessarily i mean it is because they're below the five minute but it's not necessarily bearish"
"4374740","4385130"," to me come back down here and check this pivot at 432.71 and then"
"4385130","4390050"," what you may be wondering why i put pivots in here we already tagged this one here we tagged this"
"4390050","4395610"," one here we tagged and this is our new low on the day right so bears are looking for a"
"4395610","4401470"," new low so they want to get lower than 432.71 this is our first pivot to the upside we"

"4478600","4485000"," the grind trade coming in and then bam to the upside right that's where you get your 300 and also"
"4485000","4494690"," possibly should i just leave this for you there's your 350 to the upside"
"4494690","4504090"," right there your 350 target let me delete this so you can see them see it better i'll redraw them"
"4504090","4513670"," for you so the original target on tesla was 300 right or 296"
"4513670","4523590"," i think came in early and sold it remember we were at 220 and we"
"4523590","4532140"," said we're going to take profit and we went to 216 or something like that right way back here"
"4535100","4539180"," remember we said yeah targets 220 the sellers are going to come in and they're going to try to sell"
"4539180","4543400"," you down before you ever get there you're going to see bulls taking profit before you ever get"
"4543400","4550140"," there and that's what they did right you got a 296 price target above over here and what did they"
"4550140","4556900"," do came in and took profit and got out right just like that got right out before you ever hit"
"4556900","4564980"," the target and so what does that mean to you it means you're going to get consolidation for a move"
"4564980","4571600"," higher you're going to wait for the daily trigger to come up to carry you above and hit the 350"
"4571600","4582760"," target right here so what does that mean for you excuse"
"4582760","4592680"," me it means you're going to trade this zone here right by these dips by a dip"
"4592680","4601600"," by a dip by a dip by a dip by a dip got a range of consolidation your ultimate goal"
"4601600","4611520"," appears is 350 up here right this is july this is mid-july how low can it go they"
"4611520","4616960"," can go all the way down to 200 bucks believe it or not will you get that i don't know"
"4616960","4626580"," but i can tell you this uh you take a couple things i meant wrong one normally i'll give a"
"4626580","4633940"," shout out some friends and i'll say it's time it's ready this moves looks like it's ready to go up"
"4635680","4646720"," all right this is coming up right here you"
"4646720","4651740"," get this consolidation down here tag above the hourly comes down to swing below prices right here"
"4651740","4657840"," and i go it's time and boom we get that tag that push high we break above the 296 consolidate"
"4657840","4666820"," and then the 350 now saying all of this here if price at any point begins to break below that"
"4666820","4674480"," 229 that 200 reject to the upside the trade to 350 is dead so you're watching all of this as"
"4674480","4678900"," it takes place you're watching the consolidation trade you don't want to see it turn into"
"4678900","4686060"," distribution if that turns into distribution trade to 350 is gone right you erase the possibility"
"4686060","4695360"," of 350 the probability was the trade to 300 the possibility is the trade to 350 if uh so so"
"4695360","4702260"," 350 is like an extension so if we get the extension of 350 great if we don't we begin to"
"4702260","4708680"," roll over here you're also ready for that trade to the downside i think that trade is like a check"
"4708680","4718180"," on 150 165 dollars so whenever we do roll this market over here's a key point here too there are"
"4718180","4726760"," upper targets above 350 there's a target of 500 on tassel believe it or not above that 350 as long"
"4726760","4732380"," as we stay on trend we'll go there so if you're like hey i think we're going to go 500"
"4732380","4740460"," by end of year or march or something like that that trade is still alive right now and that trade"
"4740460","4750340"," will stay alive as long as we stay on trend so if we're up here doing this kind of"
"4750340","4758060"," stuff here we will actually go up there and take out 10 this is like a year not uh not"
"4758060","4764160"," a 30 minute chart here 10 this is like end of year we will we will track that 500 but"
"4764160","4769780"," still you as a trader you need to know if we break below that weekly and start to reject if"
"4769780","4775520"," you watch the daily roll over on it uh the hourly rolls over on it the weekly begins to roll"
"4775520","4780540"," over on it uh you start taking that hey fuck it they pot i'm going to assume when that happens"
"4780540","4787300"," that we're pausing rates permanently or we're like permanently at six or seven percent or something"
"4787300","4792980"," and or they've just said fuck it we broke something we're going to put some kiwi on the market then"
"4792980","4799820"," you'll see that roll over in in tasla now let's say next week you saw that roll over in tasla"
"4799820","4807300"," saw tasla bleed down that's not necessarily bearish if it pulls back up and keeps going up your"
"4807300","4816880"," bullish it's only when you begin to roll with it that you'll say fuck it we're rolling the market"
"4816880","4822020"," over and i don't care what the news is the news could be fucking i don't know uh you could"
"4822020","4827580"," be uh uh we started kiwi and the market's beginning to roll you'll still take that trade lower"
"4827580","4834180"," you'll trade the price action that's in front of you regardless of what the news is i've got for"
"4834180","4838340"," right now still up trend are you looking for a dip to buy that's actually not a bad thing to"
"4838340","4843460"," be watching right here that yellow line right there and two key price targets for you is uh"
"4843460","4851960"," currently 229 46 and a few weeks yeah about 230 let's call it 230 if you can get a down"
"4851960","4858580"," move to 230 it's a nice place to buy a three month or a week or a leap or something"
"4858580","4867960"," on for that upside target on tasla and let's talk about that briefly too uh"
"4867960","4875920"," when i buy tasla i'm always looking for the daily velocity to have come down and cooled off"
"4875920","4881660"," whatever it's cooled off i can usually find a decent dip on it that proved true down here and it"
"4881660","4888080"," proved true down here as well so just just watching tasla in the past right you get that that"
"4888080","4895540"," powerful move up boom you'll hear bulls just like non-stop just crap they're like just garbage"
"4895540","4900120"," coming out of their mouths they'll get burned and burned and squeezed out and then the actual trade"
"4900120","4904560"," was down the road so if you're just looking at this right here and how tasla trades normally"
"4904560","4911080"," there's that cooling off period right you see it see it back there that cooling off period you end"
"4911080","4918500"," up getting that that cooling off period of the downside a little bit of a scare just yeah yeah we"
"4918500","4924600"," lied and then boom actually get that move later on to the upside so i'm assuming if you're tasla"
"4924600","4932180"," bull long-time bull you know about this now we'll say something if the price gets above the hourly"
"4932180","4942080"," and we hold above 296 you are free to take a trade to 350 if at any"
"4942080","4946600"," point uh we start going up and we're like boom we're going to smash through that 296 and we're"
"4946600","4951740"," going to hold that fucking line at 300 you can take that 50 point trade uh with with uh"
"4951740","4963430"," confirmation of the upside if i get rivian happy friday everybody oh wait a minute dude"
"4963430","4973380"," really still not ready in my view"

"5384450","5394370"," let me find out where the daily trigger is on spa four twenty"

"5407810","5412710"," i hope we do we can get down here that'd be fucking awesome i might have to think about getting"
"5412710","5422610"," some spreads here like this"
"5422610","5428630"," is so close to like it's so fucking close to getting a spread like hand grenades and horseshoes"
"5428630","5434930"," like a month or two from that ain't gonna matter like these points here ain't gonna mean shit i"
"5434930","5446530"," might start a position today uh a sizable position if we can get it if"
"5446530","5452850"," not uh so we've got two places i want to buy this is the first one right here four twenty"
"5452850","5461430"," eight and my second buy currently sits at four twelve twenty seven so this four twenty seven and"
"5461430","5468210"," four twelve are places that i'll always put size on regardless of what the market says so right"
"5468210","5476730"," here i'm surprised it's today maybe there's some grind in there i can grab grab some theta so if we"
"5476730","5481950"," get down here today at any point if we do get down here at any point today we're gonna start"
"5481950","5488950"," looking at if you're a swing trader i want you to know that um if you're a swing trader and"

"5496070","5501110"," i've got two places that i'll buy them at here's one of them it'll be more conservative down here"
"5501670","5508390"," and i'm more aggressive one at four twelve just heads up if we ever get down here if at any"
"5508390","5521080"," point like this week next week into the thirtieth it's getting close we're almost there i didn't"
"5521080","5530080"," realize we're this close right now i mean i did but i didn't maybe this has to do with the"

"5586620","5596340"," collar you guys want to look at that again maybe so just heads up so so today into next week"
"5596340","5602440"," we're gonna look at uh calculating again this morning i calculated what the upside targets would be"
"5602440","5612220"," on on the uh on the collar four q three now that doesn't mean we don't get a"
"5612220","5622160"," low like a low for the quarter uh i'll try to"
"5622160","5627120"," calculate the top bottom and middle right now or today i'll try to or maybe over the weekend i"
"5627120","5634420"," don't know but i'm going to try to calculate uh what the strikes will be for you and if we"
"5634420","5643420"," can find a way to figure out what the low is going to be for q three uh we can"
"5643420","5652360"," capture like a quarterly spread for that for that three to five percent uh it's like three to five"
"5652360","5658960"," percent from right here for q three to the upside should be about it like three to five percent"
"5658960","5668670"," right here somewhere in there so we could probably even if we went down and hit a low"
"5668670","5675870"," target still capture all that theta and make a bang and fucking trade so we're going to start"
"5675870","5684090"," thinking about that this week into the 30th or maybe if we can kind of get a low this week"
"5686590","5691610"," we can start to look at that uh four four is it four forty six and four fifty six i"
"5691610","5695970"," got man out of that wrong but somewhere in there i think it's like four forty eight four fifty six"
"5696950","5705610"," four the for an expected high and q three i looked at it this morning on stream so i'll look"

"12617360","12624880"," all the way up here staircase up this weekly will stay lower and that's where you're going to get"
"12624880","12632360"," like your major dip buys um so anyways if at any point you get 160 or 165 long the fuck"
"12632360","12642360"," out of it into into uh march j and j does that work"

"12668400","12673240"," up so if this is extremely bullish man and the other point that i want to make here in this"
"12673240","12680980"," chart is uh here's the other point i want to make in this chart there's a bunch of these tickers"
"12680980","12689000"," here right that are coming to a point when you get this cross here i want you to know something"
"12690120","12697980"," that you're going to get this cross right here and there's going to be a major test of it shit"
"12697980","12706360"," hold on give me something like this let's say right that's the orange line right there's going to"
"12706360","12714260"," be a major test of it and these fucking sellers will be they'll be vicious you'll you'll i think"
"12714260","12720960"," you're looking at a big squeeze coming up but my point stands that uh if you get this like window"
"12720960","12728260"," dressing trade in here and you come back down and test this if this test is successful this is"
"12728260","12735080"," market wide there's a big test coming for the market and if this test is if you get this back"
"12735080","12741020"," test on the daily and the weekly it's like moon mission time for the stock market this is when you"
"12741020","12745400"," see like fun strat out there see guys like tom lee out there telling you we're going to six"

"12790360","12796080"," now what i'm talking about i think this is what tom lee is talking about um hold on here um"
"12805280","12817780"," people titled right now we're here fuck it and this"
"12817780","12823680"," really is what um this is kind of funny too because i already know what jpm is talking about i'll"
"12823680","12828740"," hear people out there say things like um you don't want this to happen you don't want that to"
"12828740","12834200"," happen and i'm going to tell you why i'm going to tell you why right now i'm going to show"
"12834200","12844920"," you why what they're talking about oh"
"12844920","12853720"," there's like four basic patterns okay and there two of them that two of them they're talking about"
"12853720","12861320"," basically right now is that we came down right we're going to get a new high trade sideways then"
"12861320","12868680"," bloodbath they're they're saying that we're like right here basically you're right here that's"
"12868680","12873560"," they're saying you're going to watch out it's going to get really ugly we're going to go down it's"
"12873560","12882060"," like 2008 but they were saying that shit fucking last year same same thing right here another"
"12882060","12887180"," another instance of it right we come up we got a new high blast down one more high than to"
"12887180","12905610"," to the to the depths of hell telling you they're telling you they were right here this"
"12905610","12915590"," is the one that this is the big one so this one right here they're telling it some"
"12915590","12921510"," people are saying that we're here right uh they're they're they're trying to tell you is that or"
"12921510","12927450"," what i'm telling you is that here is so i'm telling you that we're right here right we're going to"
"12927450","12933270"," come back up that didn't happen though did it uh and i'm saying to you this is it right so"
"12933270","12938270"," we go up and get all all-time highs up here uh this is right this is where i think"
"12938270","12943530"," that we are this is the top this is the tom Lee fun strat where are we in this this"
"12943530","12950150"," is what they tried telling you we were right tried telling you this is one you two you three this"
"12950150","12955910"," is your sideways trade and then you get a big push up in 23 25 26 this is a soft"
"12955910","12965670"," landing trade right here but we've already blasted above that haven't we the"
"12965670","12973950"," extension come back down right we find that new low at the bottom of the trough that's 3500 and"
"12973950","12983840"," we're off and running you'll see it right here too right blast down"
"12983840","12988900"," ping pong ping pong we have we're in the middle of an extension and they're looking for that last"
"12988900","12996420"," part trough no new low maybe this is 3800 off and running"
"12996420","13005730"," either way"
"13005730","13015670"," you already know where i already showed you where that bottom was on jnj so i'm bullish here"
"13015670","13022350"," on jnj in general if you get a stop over here let's see you get stopped out of this uptrend"
"13022350","13030900"," and you're like oh let me cry myself a river right you get stopped out you just go and buy"
"13030900","13036460"," that bottom of that trough again like all the bearishness out there and the like like oh"
"13036460","13042000"," everything's horrible and i'm bearish and i'm i'm this bear the the large part of that trade is"
"13042000","13050240"," likely over so it's it not you're shifting from super bear to buy every fucking major dip along the"
"13050240","13056140"," way every one of those scenarios you are unless you're looking at the first two that i showed you"
"13056140","13060940"," where we get the major bloodbath if that's the case that we're going to get the major bloodbath uh"
"13060940","13068000"," like in 25 or 23 or 25 and that means you've got all-time highs to get right now you're"
"13068000","13072180"," gonna get a bible dip at like 3800 you're gonna get another all-time high and then we're gonna roll"
"13072180","13080460"," down in like three to five years so either way i'm bullish on jnj either way you buy these fucking"
"13080460","13090400"," dips as they present themselves what's going on in spoons man fells happen in the spoons fucks"
"13090400","13105510"," going on over here shazamo i"
"13105510","13113330"," talked about so far yesterday i called out so far yesterday i spent uh fifteen minutes on so far"
"13113330","13122790"," five five or ten minutes on so far yesterday i like jnj i said i like jnj i like it"
"13122790","13131730"," uh i'm not bullish on on jnj and i'm not bearish on this market either uh in no way shape"
"13131730","13139830"," or form and if you're if you're someone from jpm crying about it get fucked you didn't listen to me"
"13139830","13148010"," in jtoktober you didn't listen me in december you listened to me in march you didn't listen me in"
"13148010","13153530"," june when i made those videos when i said buy this bottom you didn't listen to me in noktober when"
"13153530","13163410"," i said buy this bottom Even if we hit"
"13163410","13171730"," 3,200, tradeable bottom, we hit 2,800, 2,800, tradeable bottom, buy it. "
"13173350","13178510"," It's like a big giant pivot, pivot up, pivot down, pivot up, pivot down, tradeable bottom."
"13179930","13184950"," The only time that we don't have that tradeable bottom, where we get the failure, the only time"
"13184950","13189070"," historically, is when there's fraud in the market."
"13190330","13193130"," Now, I know you're going to say there is fraud in the market. "
"13195230","13198790"," Oh, but if it is there, I don't see it."
"13198950","13200050"," No one else is seeing it."
"13203420","13206340"," That's the only reason we got the second leg in 2008. "
"13207420","13208400"," It's the only reason."
"13210060","13211880"," Have there not been that housing fraud?"
"13213440","13217480"," Fucking your boy back there, Mike Barrie would be in fucking prison."
"13218240","13218500"," He would. "
"13218900","13219740"," He'd be in fucking prison."
"13221720","13225460"," He would have been fucking bankrupt and bankrupted a lot of fucking people."
"13225760","13228040"," Because that last leg down was the only way he made money. "
"13229360","13232640"," And he missed out on so much fucking money getting there too."
"13232960","13234280"," So there's that whole other conversation."
"13235380","13239680"," Even though he paid his people, they fucking waited a long time. "
"13239780","13243340"," It would have been much wealthier had they just rode that all that shit up."
"13243560","13246480"," So a lot of different arguments with Mike Barrie being that smart."
"13247500","13249640"," The clock is fucking right eventually. "
"13250600","13252940"," Until that time, though, you can make a ton of money."
"13253700","13257520"," So, you know, it's kind of weird."
"13257820","13261600"," Like I have one hundred dollars ten years from now. "
"13261680","13263420"," It becomes a hundred thousand dollars."
"13264000","13266660"," Along that ten years, I probably could have made a million dollars."
"13268020","13269820"," As the guy that made a hundred thousand right. "
"13270180","13273580"," Sure, but what about the other fucking guys that made a million along the way?"
"13276100","13277740"," No one likes to address that."
"13282660","13284340"," It's all about selling you a story."
"13284600","13289540"," So it really is. "
"13289640","13291080"," It really is about selling you a story."
"13291220","13291760"," It's a good story."
"13292200","13293640"," I think the Mike Barrie story is a great story. "
"13294500","13295840"," I have nothing against it."
"13295980","13296940"," Again, nothing against what he did."
"13297340","13297880"," I like what he did. "
"13298480","13298780"," I get it."
"13299200","13299560"," A hundred percent."
"13303440","13305360"," But I'll tell you what, along the way, right?"
"13305360","13307540"," There was like fucking trillions made by people. "
"13307880","13309360"," And they fucking partied."
"13310140","13312700"," And a whole fuck a ton of them did not get destroyed."
"13313500","13315380"," They were drinking champagne out on Wall Street. "
"13316160","13317100"," They were like, whatever."
"13317900","13318580"," Is that your guy?"
"13318780","13319620"," We'll make him a movie star."
"13322500","13324360"," You know, greed is..."
"13326160","13329180"," Greed smiles as bad shit's happening. "
"13329420","13330800"," Greed's like, fuck you, I got mine."
"13331660","13332220"," That's true."
"13332980","13338140"," They might portray something in a movie or some shit where some, some pole dancer is losing or"
"13338140","13339560"," three houses or something like that. "
"13339680","13342680"," But the people that were making money, they give a fly in fuck."
"13344280","13346060"," That's horrible to say, but it's true."
"13351980","13354500"," You can care all you want about those people, too. "
"13354580","13356180"," You can have feelings for those people."
"13356900","13358460"," But you're not that person."
"13359460","13362400"," You're actually a bad guy to those people. "
"13362660","13363080"," Do you know that?"
"13363880","13366360"," Do you know that you're actually a bad guy to those people?"
"13367100","13370820"," You're not their savior as a bear or a seller."
"13371940","13372760"," You aren't."
"13372980","13374480"," They fucking hate you like they hate me. "
"13375020","13377620"," We're like the, we're like the scabs of the world."
"13378140","13378480"," You know?"
"13379220","13385660"," We, we, we, we trade things of value like they have and have no value, right?"
"13390240","13392880"," All they want to do is invest and get their money back."
"13392880","13395300"," When a company increases in value, right?"
"13396100","13401820"," They don't mind like a short seller per se, but you know, our profession, what we do is not"
"13401820","13404300"," considered to help society. "
"13405360","13412140"," You know, sometimes here short sellers like try to like get out of soapbox and say, I'm righteous."
"13412940","13416520"," I try to keep the market clean, but let's be honest, behind a closed door, it's all about making"
"13416520","13417080"," fucking money."
"13417220","13417820"," That's what it is. "
"13419440","13420880"," So sorry, man."
"13421280","13421980"," That's like real."
"13422880","13423560"," That's the real deal. "
"13424820","13426960"," That's like some shit story for some guy."
"13427260","13431560"," Like those movies are meant for someone that lost everything not on Main Street."
"13432560","13438660"," Those movies are meant for consumption by someone who lost their home in their 401k. "
"13439080","13443380"," They're not meant for you as a, as a trader or an investor as a fucking short seller."
"13443600","13444080"," That meant for you."
"13451840","13452840"," That's right, man. "
"13455220","13459740"," Whenever we have a, whenever it's like 2008 comes along and you tell people you're a stock trader,"
"13460260","13461300"," they're fucking hate you."
"13463960","13468740"," You tell them that you're a fucking, you're buying zero date calls, zero date puts."
"13469480","13470100"," They don't care. "
"13470340","13474040"," They're going to differentiate between you being a short seller or a fucking long bull or whatever."
"13474780","13477140"," They're going to say, they're going to say that you are what?"
"13477460","13479220"," You're, you're a speculator."
"13480660","13482940"," And you're poisoned to our stock market. "
"13482940","13483400"," So."
"13489670","13490830"," Yeah, I mean, I like what he did."
"13491110","13492730"," I get what he did. "
"13492870","13493410"," I understand it."
"13493830","13494230"," 100%."
"13496530","13499930"," But let's not forget who made a lot of fucking money in that time period. "
"13499930","13501270"," I mean, a lot of fucking money."
"13501950","13524790"," Oh, you"
"13524790","13530450"," know, you can say Tom Lee will be bankrupt, but even in all these charts, man, like basically"
"13530450","13532910"," they're saying we have the opportunity to go."
"13533110","13535590"," It's like, like cutting all the bullshit in the fat. "
"13536110","13538130"," As long as we stay doing what we're doing."
"13539630","13543230"," We have a very high probability of testing."
"13544590","13545470"," Of the previous highs. "
"13546170","13547610"," That fits the white golf models."
"13548550","13552810"," The second probability is that we go to a major high."
"13553630","13554530"," Like a 6000. "
"13555670","13556770"," With a pullback."
"13557090","13558830"," The correction and then a major major high."
"13559490","13561010"," Well, not one pullback, like two. "
"13563810","13565910"," So like, even in the most bearish scenarios."
"13567150","13568090"," We're going up."
"13569410","13570950"," And not only that. "
"13571650","13576790"," The only way you get that 2008 thing is fraud, actual fraud."
"13577490","13579730"," And you can see whether you like it or not."
"13580350","13586430"," You can see that the fed is trying to take a stance of no more gas and no more breaks. "
"13587910","13589510"," They're trying to change, right?"
"13589630","13594830"," Or at least the regime change right now is we're only going to do enough QE to be supportive of"
"13594830","13595550"," the market trade."
"13596510","13596910"," Normally."
"13598830","13600770"," We'll let it have its normal ups and downs. "
"13601010","13603810"," Try to get it back into a business cycle, economic cycle."
"13604550","13605690"," Right now it's not in that cycle."
"13605890","13606550"," It's all fucked up. "
"13606670","13607410"," We have like other site."
"13607510","13608830"," We have like a COVID cycle going on."
"13608930","13609730"," We got our last cycle. "
"13610110","13612410"," Our last pre COVID business cycle going on."
"13613210","13613770"," And they're trying."
"13614010","13615710"," That's that's that is what the soft landing is. "
"13616430","13623070"," It's basically telling you that they're trying to not be so like one side or the other side or the"
"13623070","13625810"," other side where wild fucking swings."
"13628350","13630890"," And we were we were we were tracking that."
"13632130","13635490"," So when people were saying we're going to sell volatility as an asset class. "
"13636430","13641710"," Our stock market was beginning to look like it was going to swing wildly out of control."
"13642790","13647310"," And so they're putting measures in right now to stop the two attempts to stop that from happening."
"13649210","13651970"," They're trying to arrest the upside and the downside. "
"13652950","13656130"," Turn it into like the 1950s, 60s and 70s."
"13656850","13659850"," Now whether they're successful at that or not, I don't know."
"13661570","13663730"," But I think that's the the intent. "
"13668320","13676260"," Bull plane right now on forming on the white and red line coming into that same resistance."
"13677460","13679700"," The hourly trigger three trigger trigger."
"13679840","13684520"," Bull cluster is here for an explosive move to the upside for the spy. "
"13685380","13687200"," You know, I'm going to show you guys something else right now."
"13687220","13688920"," If you're watching me right now, I'll show you guys something else."
"13689300","13689980"," It's Friday, right?"
"13690760","13693480"," Sometimes I show that some of the guys are like, Oh, guys going to do it again. "
"13697380","13698520"," I'm going to show you guys something."
"13698720","13700180"," If you're a bear out there, I'm going to show you something."
"13700360","13700520"," Okay. "
"13701880","13703600"," This doesn't happen that that often."
"13707630","13709170"," Here, I'll show you guys some cool shit."
"13718960","13720260"," I'm going to delete all this shit. "
"13723180","13724180"," Move 12 drawings."
"13724800","13724860"," Okay."
"13725420","13726200"," Drawings are gone. "
"13726820","13728000"," It makes it's real simple for you."
"13728200","13728240"," Okay."
"13728740","13729800"," It makes it's really fucking simple. "
"13735320","13736360"," I'm going to show you two charts."
"13737920","13741240"," First what I'm going to show you is this one right here."
"13742720","13743140"," Price. "
"13744600","13745980"," It's above the yellow line."
"13746160","13748500"," It's above the orange line above the blue line."
"13748900","13750240"," This doesn't happen that often. "
"13752140","13755640"," When this does happen, see the see the expansion here?"
"13758640","13762600"," It's very bullish and it just started right there."
"13763360","13764480"," It just started."
"13766120","13769700"," It doesn't happen frequently when it does happen happen historically. "
"13770040","13771280"," I got to go to a day chart to show you guys."
"13777140","13778800"," When it does happen, right?"
"13780740","13782940"," We usually get some decent runs out of it historically."
"13782940","13785000"," Historically, listen to me closely. "
"13787260","13788780"," You want to see the last one right here?"
"13789020","13789560"," It's 2020."
"13790360","13792440"," Price yellow orange blue."
"13793100","13793940"," Want to see it again?"
"13795040","13796900"," Price yellow orange blue. "
"13797320","13798220"," See the length here?"
"13800200","13801080"," Want to see it again?"
"13802740","13804420"," Price yellow orange blue."
"13804820","13806540"," But that came off a larger run, right?"
"13807720","13808440"," Remember the blue?"
"13808620","13809600"," We didn't have the blue here, right?"
"13810020","13810780"," So let's go to the blue."
"13811140","13811160"," Ready?"
"13811160","13811220"," Ready?"
"13811980","13813560"," Price yellow orange blue. "
"13813700","13814160"," Look at that run."
"13815060","13815580"," Monster."
"13818060","13819480"," Want to see another blue yellow?"
"13819740","13820720"," Another one right here?"
"13821880","13823920"," Price yellow orange blue. "
"13824040","13824540"," Look at that run."
"13825060","13825580"," Monster."
"13826480","13827900"," You want to see this one right here?"
"13829680","13832520"," This one right here is September of 2010. "
"13833820","13836240"," That lasted until July of 2011."
"13837840","13838700"," That's a year."
"13841580","13843640"," Want to see another one we had a breakout above the blue?"
"13844200","13845280"," There's another one right here. "
"13847000","13848220"," This one was years, right?"
"13848460","13848520"," Boom."
"13849120","13849160"," Years."
"13850920","13852160"," Want to see another breakout?"
"13852620","13853780"," I'll show you every instance of it. "
"13853900","13854680"," You want to see a big one?"
"13855220","13856140"," This one's a fucking monster."
"13857340","13857800"," It's 1995."
"13859160","13859940"," You want to go farther back?"
"13860100","13861600"," I'll take you back to the 1800s if you want. "
"13864100","13865060"," Want to see another one?"
"13865760","13867300"," There's another one right there, 1991."
"13868760","13871180"," Price broke above the blue, right?"
"13871340","13872480"," Remember the blue key point?"
"13873140","13874700"," Price yellow orange blue."
"13874860","13875500"," You want to see another one?"
"13876320","13877500"," There's another one right there. "
"13878620","13879220"," Broke above."
"13879480","13880800"," Broke, this looks like right now, doesn't it?"
"13881260","13881500"," Boom."
"13882480","13883000"," Multiple years. "
"13883680","13884260"," That's 1989."
"13886240","13886640"," 1984."
"13887240","13887860"," Same thing. "
"13888220","13888920"," Want to see another one?"
"13889540","13889940"," 1982."
"13890620","13892660"," I can bring you back to the 1800s if you want."
"13893180","13894840"," Now, forget all this for a minute. "
"13895620","13897620"," Forget all this for one minute, okay?"
"13917130","13922570"," I can show this on DJI for his history of the stock market."
"13925090","13926770"," I'm going to show you something else here."
"13931860","13935370"," Time is the issue here. "
"13938490","13939970"," Time is the issue."
"13941970","13943970"," Jerome Powell's greatest fucking trick."
"13946230","13948710"," Jerome Powell's greatest fucking trick was time. "
"13951870","13957790"," And what he did was, he spent time trading us down in sideways, coaxing the market."
"13959210","13964110"," Okay, and it brought us back into a place where there's a tradeable bottom."
"13964410","13965970"," This is the COVID crash down here. "
"13967490","13968030"," Right?"
"13968450","13969470"," We tagged down here."
"13969550","13970790"," This is just a few years ago, right?"
"13970790","13973990"," Tagged us this purple line and look what he did over time."
"13975450","13978550"," It gave time for that purple line to come up. "
"13978830","13981390"," Look at the low we got down here."
"13981590","13983070"," Very close to the COVID bottom."
"13983270","13984590"," Mostly probably didn't even know that. "
"13986870","13991430"," That from the COVID 2019 bottom, we've basically hit close enough."
"13993530","13994090"," Relatively."
"13996450","13997570"," In October. "
"13999470","14005710"," This is why Mike Wilson was saying to you, we expect the bottom to be 3200."
"14007250","14011530"," Because this is the shit that they're using to target it."
"14011870","14012390"," Does that make sense?"
"14013710","14015610"," That's why he's giving you those numbers. "
"14016710","14017550"," I'm going to tell you the reason."
"14019390","14020850"," That's why he targeted that."
"14022970","14025890"," He wanted this one right here in my cursor is he didn't get it. "
"14025950","14026250"," He got close."
"14026250","14028130"," He got 3491."
"14028770","14029430"," Not bad. "
"14029630","14030070"," 200 points."
"14030650","14031650"," Byers stepped in."
"14032430","14034590"," Different time period in the world, right?"
"14034770","14035290"," Everybody knows. "
"14035570","14036010"," Everybody knows."
"14036250","14036950"," People want to jump in."
"14037110","14037670"," They don't want to miss it. "
"14040960","14042480"," But I want to show you something else here."
"14042580","14042900"," It's important."
"14046900","14049720"," You can kind of predict when we're going to start to crash. "
"14050800","14052320"," And actually see it right here."
"14054260","14057060"," We're maxed out on weekly or maxed out on monthly."
"14057360","14059220"," We're kind of maxed out in quarterly. "
"14059960","14067340"," You can start to see the divesting here."
"14067500","14069500"," The divesting here on weekly."
"14070700","14071540"," Come on, man. "
"14071820","14072480"," Fuck, man."
"14073360","14074180"," Right there."
"14074340","14075280"," You can see it right there. "
"14077240","14079900"," You can see it right here topping out."
"14080480","14082480"," You can see the topping out over here."
"14086330","14088110"," Start to see the big waves, right?"
"14088510","14090350"," See it right here actually happening, right?"
"14090590","14093470"," See this on higher time frames peeking out right here. "
"14094270","14095790"," And then boom, boom, boom."
"14096150","14096510"," Start right."
"14096690","14098350"," Price hasn't shown it yet, has it?"
"14099690","14101670"," But you start to see it right there, right?"
"14102730","14103890"," And we're not even right. "
"14104050","14104610"," Here's the peak."
"14105370","14108190"," And then you start to see we're losing, right?"
"14108790","14109250"," We're losing."
"14111070","14116290"," And as this begins to happen and prices isn't showing, we start having to decline thereafter,"
"14116770","14116790"," right?"
"14116950","14122610"," So you can kind of predict when we're coming into a major top before it happens. "
"14126990","14128630"," We're not doing that yet, are we?"
"14128850","14129410"," We're accumulating."
"14130910","14131350"," Cumulating."
"14132310","14134750"," We're not quite at that top yet, that major top. "
"14135930","14137370"," Let's look at some other stuff here."
"14138070","14140690"," What's the next greatest trick that they've ever played on us?"
"14140850","14143470"," Let's look at big time frames, big ones."
"14145570","14146650"," Big time frames. "
"14147030","14147330"," Here you go."
"14147470","14147910"," That's 2008."
"14147910","14148870"," Look where they hit. "
"14150750","14151770"," That gray line, right?"
"14152030","14153490"," That's the fraud, right?"
"14154450","14155670"," It's the fraud, right?"
"14155790","14156330"," See this right here?"
"14156570","14158170"," That part of the trade, the fraud trade?"
"14158730","14159470"," Broke the what?"
"14161030","14163230"," Without that fraud, it would have bounced."
"14164270","14166010"," It's the last leg down right there."
"14166990","14170790"," So you're not going to expect the last leg down here, are you?"
"14171750","14174130"," On purple, unless we have actual fraud. "
"14175630","14176430"," What was happening?"
"14177770","14181530"," Companies were imploding, mortgages were imploding, right?"
"14182250","14185470"," Banks imploding, right?"
"14185810","14187330"," So that last little leg right there."
"14188450","14192010"," So what's the next greatest trick that we have being played on you that you don't even realize?"
"14193410","14196010"," As time passes, that number raises."
"14196870","14201890"," This below was, guess where it was, it was at 1600 when we started the role. "
"14202110","14207990"," Now it's at 2000, and even targeting this is like 5% chance."
"14209730","14211650"," The whole history of the stock market."
"14213790","14215550"," 5% chance we get down there. "
"14215690","14216950"," And now it's even fucking higher."
"14217210","14218990"," It was at 16 or 18, now it's at 2%."
"14221490","14223530"," This is like 15% chance. "
"14224350","14226070"," This is now at 2700."
"14228030","14231630"," Your big chance for a down move, guess what Jerome did to you?"
"14231990","14232670"," He fucked you."
"14233210","14235450"," It was down here at 28, guess where it is today?"
"14237570","14238050"," 3300. "
"14238850","14245570"," So if you bought this fucking down here at 3450 and we even rolled down in the next fucking three"
"14245570","14248130"," months, it's going to be, guess what, 3400."
"14249810","14252870"," So you should have bought this, and you should have bought this."
"14253350","14253850"," Does that make sense?"
"14255770","14257370"," Our fucking market goes up. "
"14260190","14264050"," So you should have bought October, and you should buy the next purple."
"14265450","14267410"," Because historically we only get to purple."
"14268190","14274190"," If you, if we're down here at purple and you start to see banks failing, mortgages failing, yeah,"
"14274350","14275630"," we'll trade this down to the gray. "
"14277130","14280350"," And this is the entire market going all the way back to the 1800s."
"14283290","14285610"," We got really fucking close to the COVID load."
"14285770","14286590"," That was pretty bad, right?"
"14287410","14288790"," You want to see some previous examples?"
"14294650","14297970"," See that big stretch and see when they get closer again?"
"14297970","14299470"," We start to recover. "
"14301510","14302370"," This is 2000."
"14303170","14304190"," We only hit the whites."
"14304470","14305610"," That's the .com bubble. "
"14308350","14310350"," And look at the .com bubble."
"14312030","14313430"," We were just right here."
"14314390","14315550"," We were just right there. "
"14316630","14318770"," So even this leg is the one they're talking to you about."
"14319150","14320470"," Let's take this last leg out."
"14320990","14322050"," We didn't do that though, did we?"
"14323110","14325750"," We bounced and we said, fuck you, we're out of here. "
"14325750","14327970"," Like every other example in history."
"14328630","14332870"," And the key point you have to remember here is, key point you remember here is, when we bounced"
"14332870","14334150"," here, what happened?"
"14335450","14339150"," We got price, yellow, orange and blue."
"14339490","14340270"," And that's what we just got. "
"14340530","14350530"," So when you see that, when you see this right here, you know what it tells you?"
"14351270","14352330"," Fucking tells you."
"14354050","14358010"," Fucking tells you to look for two or three bounces to buy."
"14358010","14360270"," In the orange. "
"14361470","14363950"," And like eight or nine to buy on the yellow."
"14365510","14366890"," We're going to trade this up."
"14369570","14371650"," At minimum, we're going to trade that up. "
"14371890","14377610"," And historically, you're talking about a 15% chance that we've enrolled this."
"14380630","14382410"," Small chance, like 15%."
"14382410","14383890"," We might, but small. "
"14385130","14386470"," For at least a year."
"14387210","14390530"," Now, as we get into a year to two to three years, yeah, your percentage is getting higher."
"14390650","14391150"," They're going to roll it. "
"14391710","14394670"," But for a year, I mean, if you're talking about, we're going to roll it this week."
"14395230","14396810"," I think I have one example."
"14398530","14401170"," Historic historical history of the stock market. "
"14402230","14404230"," One where we went, I think six months."
"14405030","14406490"," There's only one prior example."
"14408370","14409970"," So we're talking the law probabilities. "
"14411070","14412870"," You buy the fucking dip on this shit."
"14414150","14416110"," You buy the fucking dip on the yellow line."
"14416110","14417810"," You buy the fucking dip in the orange line. "
"14419170","14422130"," And if we start to do that role, we'll trade it."
"14422210","14423410"," We'll be aware of it when it happens."
"14427460","14428360"," Yeah, I know that. "
"14428540","14430740"," You know, that only takes one shit."
"14430880","14431500"," You know what that's for?"
"14432180","14432540"," Subsellers."
"14434480","14436460"," That's what you know, the only takes one thing. "
"14436640","14437780"," That's for a fucking subseller."
"14438640","14439000"," Seriously."
"14440580","14441940"," I'm trying to sell you subs. "
"14443480","14444260"," That's what I'm doing."
"14444380","14445620"," I'm telling you, the only takes one."
"14445620","14448300"," I'm showing you the fucking chart where it breaks down. "
"14448480","14449700"," I'll show you crazier shit."
"14450620","14454380"," I can show you the DJI going back historically to the beginning of fucking time."
"14454900","14457260"," You get one year that's red like that red bar. "
"14457580","14459560"," It always is green the next year."
"14460080","14461160"," Every example historically."
"14461740","14462540"," And you got one this year. "
"14462960","14463240"," Last year."
"14463560","14464040"," DJI A."
"14464800","14465680"," Straight to the fucking basement."
"14467200","14468400"," Bring up one year charts. "
"14468700","14470420"," It's like a one year bar chart on DJI."
"14470520","14471880"," Take a look at it from the beginning of time."
"14473180","14473620"," DJI. "
"14473720","14474620"," Bring up the chart DJI."
"14475480","14478200"," That'll go back to 1895 I think."
"14480100","14483340"," So like when you're like looking at the entire encapsulation of the stock market. "
"14483820","14485000"," You can't trade that shit."
"14485460","14488820"," You're not going to trade the only takes one time in fucking 200 years."
"14489540","14491640"," If you're doing that, you tell me that. "
"14491780","14492220"," You know what I think?"
"14492500","14493800"," You got a thousand dollars to your name."
"14494360","14494960"," That's what I think."
"14495420","14497240"," You either have a thousand dollars to your name. "
"14497960","14499180"," Or you're selling something."
"14500560","14502820"," Subs, newspapers, fucking CNBC."
"14503580","14504440"," Market watch. "
"14504460","14505160"," Market beat."
"14505400","14506280"," Wherever fuck is out there."
"14506760","14507300"," Barons. "
"14508100","14509240"," Whatever that is."
"14509440","14509980"," That's who you are."
"14510080","14510680"," You're one of those people. "
"14512300","14513620"," If you were trading that."
"14514300","14515340"," With real money."
"14516240","14516680"," You're broke. "
"14517020","14517560"," You're zero."
"14519560","14521000"," You're at fucking zero."
"14521600","14522140"," Guaranteed. "
"14524500","14526580"," Do you know why right now?"
"14526760","14528740"," Do you know why JPM selling right now?"
"14528880","14530500"," Because they're long the fucking market underneath."
"14531640","14533680"," They're long the market underneath."
"14539860","14543500"," They're long and trying to offset their losses by their collar. "
"14543920","14544240"," I mean like."
"14545800","14546640"," I don't know man."
"14546900","14548800"," They're long the market. "
"14549020","14550020"," I assure you they are."
"14550160","14550860"," They're long the market."
"14551280","14551360"," Like. "
"14552260","14554440"," You hear the only one time and stuff like that."
"14557080","14558940"," You're walking away with a pittance."
"14559720","14560860"," On the one time. "
"14561100","14563080"," Even if you were to make money on the one time."
"14563760","14564460"," You lost."
"14564700","14565440"," You're like making up. "
"14565540","14567840"," You're like stepping over dollars to pick up a penny."
"14569060","14570280"," For the one time."
"14571080","14573500"," The one time doesn't pay like picking up the dollars. "
"14577720","14578640"," Never pays."
"14584400","14585560"," I assure you man."
"14586900","14587900"," The entire. "
"14589400","14590300"," Entire history."
"14591040","14592060"," Do you sell it?"
"14592160","14592660"," Let's sell it."
"14592760","14593740"," But like these claps bears. "
"14594080","14595580"," What do they what do they want to tell you?"
"14596080","14600240"," They'll tell you something like I saw one guy who was like well Apple's only you know $300 or"
"14600240","14600920"," something or $200."
"14601440","14604240"," And I'm like how many fucking times is Apple split?"
"14605040","14607500"," Someone said oh yes the spies only up."
"14608460","14611720"," If you if they bought the spy you'd only be here after 20 years. "
"14612260","14613920"," I'm like yeah but if you bought Apple."
"14615220","14616380"," Fucking 20 years ago."
"14616380","14617940"," I'm like one share of Apple. "
"14618280","14623960"," That shit's up put $27,000 $35,000 something like that one share."
"14627040","14630180"," So we're not talking dividends buybacks."
"14630520","14631100"," None of that shit. "
"14631920","14634160"," So I mean like you you lose."
"14635040","14638480"," As a longtime retail investor you fucking lose."
"14639060","14640880"," If you spend your time worrying about. "
"14641420","14643040"," You know the market crash."
"14643740","14646080"," Your time should always be focused on."
"14646960","14647780"," Where's the bottom?"
"14648280","14649320"," Where can I buy it?"
"14649880","14650920"," I don't want to miss it. "
"14652540","14654080"," There's always a Bible bottom."
"14654900","14656960"," And even when there is that's the other fucked up thing."
"14657580","14660640"," So let's say you're let's say I'm down here and I buy the 3500 right. "
"14660840","14662960"," And I come back to buy the next 3500."
"14663820","14665780"," Let's say it goes to 32 instead."
"14666380","14670500"," If I bought that 3500 right it dips down to 3200. "
"14670500","14675600"," And some clown on Fintuit's like oh look that guy bought 3500."
"14675600","14677100"," It went to 32 he got totally fucked."
"14677620","14678760"," Whenever that happens. "
"14679320","14682660"," We bounced back like a month and a half later to 3500."
"14683460","14684500"," We don't stay down there."
"14684980","14687180"," It's like an actual bottom it comes right back up. "
"14687800","14692300"," So you know all that shit that you hear out there is just fucking horseshit."
"14693220","14695440"," Now I will say some caveats to that."
"14696040","14700220"," I wouldn't be down there at that bottom buying like Peton or some shit. "
"14700500","14703720"," You have to be buying like I'm going to buy fucking Ark."
"14703920","14704300"," Not Ark."
"14704460","14704840"," Fuck it. "
"14705160","14709180"," Who do you buy in fucking Vanguard and we buy in the S&P 500 and we buy in the"
"14709180","14709440"," queues."
"14710240","14713580"," We buy in some company like Walmart or Amazon or Apple."
"14714300","14716180"," Something you know that's not going bankrupt. "
"14716800","14718480"," Because you don't want to get caught in a repricing."
"14718840","14720680"," We know that a lot of these shit companies."
"14721260","14722220"," When we do that. "
"14722260","14723760"," They never come back right."
"14724320","14725860"," We'll never be a darling ever again."
"14726740","14730400"," But when we are down there in those crash modes or we're down at that huge bottom. "
"14731380","14734040"," It's insane to not say I'm not buying that."
"14734500","14736800"," Like when we're down in like 3500 in the Spy."
"14737220","14740680"," If you weren't loading up on Vanguard Spy, Apple, Amazon. "
"14741000","14741580"," Don't fuck a matter."
"14742160","14743420"," It's down there's buying that shit."
"14744200","14745800"," It's insane to say no to that. "
"14746400","14747800"," Even if we traded 2,800."
"14748140","14749020"," You'd still buy down there."
"14749440","14750340"," So you'd DCA it. "
"14750740","14751980"," We did this video last summer."
"14752140","14753340"," We're like June and I'm like."
"14753340","14755360"," I think we're trading 3,600. "
"14755720","14756260"," And I was like, look."
"14756900","14758240"," I was like, this is easy."
"14758700","14759640"," Like we're at 3,600. "
"14760680","14762880"," Let's say next stop is 32 or 28."
"14763580","14765260"," Let's say the next stop is 16."
"14766160","14767540"," At all three of those stops. "
"14767700","14771240"," If I bought the S&P 500, I would still outperform all of you."
"14771880","14773120"," For the next 10, 20 years."
"14773600","14776140"," Just DCA those three with cash on the side. "
"14776840","14779340"," Take five million by a million dollars at 36."
"14780120","14781460"," Buy a million dollars at 32."
"14781980","14783480"," Buy a million dollars at 28. "
"14785060","14785900"," 30, 22."
"14786460","14786920"," 2,000."
"14787020","14787320"," I don't care. "
"14788340","14789860"," Those are Bible bottoms."
"14789960","14790920"," You buy them and you hold them."
"14791140","14792560"," 20 years, 10 years, whatever. "
"14795400","14799540"," And what's most insane about this, even having this conversation right now."
"14800140","14801560"," What's most fucking insane."
"14802980","14804660"," Is we're not talking about buying tops. "
"14805520","14807780"," We're talking about buying fucking bottoms."
"14808180","14810960"," So when a seller is out there telling you don't buy 3,500."
"14812420","14814840"," Put that in a fucking pipe and start smoking it. "
"14815620","14817940"," We're trying to trade a bottom, not a top."
"14818440","14823460"," We're not having a conversation about, yeah, should we buy in Tesla at 1,500 while it's racing"
"14823460","14824120"," fucking north?"
"14825040","14825540"," No."
"14826160","14828600"," We're having a conversation of a bottom down there. "
"14829320","14830120"," Not up here."
"14831380","14834120"," So even that is insane to not have that."
"14834360","14835200"," It's insanity. "
"14836240","14838280"," To be like you shouldn't buy 35."
"14838700","14840020"," There's going to be a lower dip you can buy."
"14840020","14842220"," Oh, you'll get another chance at it. "
"14842320","14843140"," It's like no, dude."
"14843180","14844060"," What if there isn't?"
"14845000","14845740"," That's the key."
"14846320","14847660"," You didn't miss the bottom. "
"14848940","14853060"," Because if it doesn't come back, you're going to look back in 5 or 10 years and say fuck."
"14853660","14854640"," I didn't buy that bottom."
"14855100","14857720"," So that 3500 was Bible. "
"14858660","14860800"," And if we go to 2800, that's Bible."
"14861740","14863400"," Now it's 26 and 2."
"14863880","14865360"," Your worst bottom is 2000."
"14870640","14874600"," As time passes, it's the greatest trick that they play on you. "
"14875320","14877340"," That no one likes to talk about."
"14877720","14881520"," Nobody, well, not nobody, but mostly bears or collapsed bears."
"14882040","14883420"," They never want to talk about this. "
"14884100","14888520"," As time passes, it works against your fucking bottom."
"14889180","14894080"," You pull out your goal post and you drag it across the field and you make up some other new"
"14894080","14898660"," bullshit excuse as to why it's now this or why it's now that."
"14900480","14903380"," And in reality, what worked against you was time. "
"14904240","14910320"," When you get the crash, you want it to go down hard and fast for like for three months, six"
"14910320","14910560"," months."
"14911300","14912200"," A month doesn't matter."
"14912720","14917760"," How do you crash in that rubber band the faster, the more price down you get. "
"14919080","14925020"," And when it start when time starts to pass, your returns on that down diminish."
"14926740","14928960"," And that's the greatest fucking trick he's playing."
"14931460","14933700"," It's a greatest trick that Jerome is fucking doing it. "
"14933960","14935060"," He's fucking you."
"14935740","14936440"," Which sucks."
"14936960","14940660"," I don't know it sucks, but he's fucking jacking you up. "
"14940900","14944880"," And by him raising rates for time, like spreading it out like we're not."
"14945000","14946140"," We're only we're not able to pause."
"14946740","14948480"," I got a couple more coming and down the road. "
"14948720","14949340"," I'm going to threaten him."
"14949940","14955240"," The more time he puts between here and there, the more that that shit just comes up like a shark"
"14955240","14955820"," from the bottom."
"14956620","14957100"," Boom. "
"14957540","14957960"," Boom."
"14960260","14961720"," That's your soft landing."
"14962000","14962700"," That's what it is. "
"14971880","14973700"," That's the fucking facts, man."
"14974600","14977060"," And that it and that includes the one time."
"14977700","14987400"," So even that one time, even that 2008 one time, you're still getting fucking taken to the fucking"
"14987400","14987660"," cleaners. "
"14987660","14994040"," Because the longer that he puts that shit off, that 2000 on the gray line is going to be at"
"14994040","14995200"," 35 fucking hundred."
"14999450","15001450"," It doesn't stay at 1600."
"15002330","15003210"," It keeps coming up. "
"15005570","15006950"," All the way back."
"15007850","15010510"," Drinking your milkshake all the way back to 1899."
"15012050","15013570"," Comes up underneath. "
"15020640","15021900"," Greatest trick he's playing."
"15022080","15022340"," It's bullshit."
"15022340","15023220"," I agree. "
"15023320","15023960"," I'm agreeing with you."
"15024240","15027220"," If you're if you're a bear claps bear, he fucked you in me."
"15027300","15028460"," I wanted to buy that so bad. "
"15028860","15029980"," I could have bought 1600."
"15030320","15031380"," I've been fucking on it."
"15032140","15037400"," I would have loved to have bought that when he supported regional banks. "
"15037480","15038820"," He fucked that happening."
"15039940","15044640"," He told you and I basically we're going to knock out every leg and we're going to support while"
"15044640","15045160"," we're doing it."
"15045280","15047160"," And when he said that shit, I was like, we're fucked. "
"15047820","15050200"," We ain't getting that down that they were all talking about."
"15050200","15051460"," We ain't getting that fucking."
"15051640","15052940"," We ain't getting that price, we thought. "
"15056490","15060770"," If he didn't support those regional banks, I'd be on it with you."
"15062330","15063470"," I'd be in agreement with you."
"15063570","15063790"," We're going to go. "
"15063910","15064630"," We're in the depths of hell."
"15064910","15066330"," But now, man, it's time's passing."
"15067090","15072210"," Even when that commercial real estate shit comes out, the guy from GS is like in the waiting wings"
"15072210","15072650"," for it. "
"15072710","15073650"," He wants to buy all that shit."
"15074690","15076030"," He's like Jamie Diamond got his bank."
"15076190","15077410"," I want to get my fucking real estate. "
"15079350","15080370"," It's all fucked up."
"15082510","15083270"," Soft landing."
"15084350","15085790"," That is your soft landing. "
"15088790","15091870"," Even if you get a 1987 crash, doesn't matter what you get."
"15092290","15093930"," They're fucking, they're fucking you all up."
"15094810","15096870"," He could like go down 800 points tomorrow. "
"15097810","15098670"," They fucked you."
"15101590","15102990"," You can't believe they did it."
"15103110","15105210"," I don't know how the fuck he pulled it out of his ass, but he did. "
"15106710","15107670"," He did it enough."
"15107870","15108930"," He pulled it out of his ass enough."
"15109730","15111070"," Mike Burry said it. "
"15111930","15113530"," Mike Burry fucking said it."
"15113690","15114570"," I like Mike."
"15114890","15117230"," Like Mike said, you bought the bottom. "
"15118390","15119770"," He said it in a tweet."
"15120630","15121590"," He was being serious."
"15124330","15126650"," It's not that we can't go down, but he knows. "
"15126990","15134470"," Mike Burry knows that time was bought for the market so that when we do get that next role, it"
"15134470","15135590"," ain't going to be fucking 16."
"15138050","15139230"," Even he knows."
"15141390","15145470"," He fucking knows fun strat knows all these guys know. "
"15147690","15151110"," Jamie Diamond knows they all fucking know every one of these last fucking guys."
"15151310","15152090"," They all fucking know."
"15153070","15154010"," Jerome knows. "
"15157310","15163120"," They all the scam goes on."
"15163300","15164040"," The fraud goes on."
"15164600","15168240"," The worst part is even though the fraud goes on whenever they do roll it. "
"15168740","15169940"," They've softened it."
"15170080","15171660"," No matter what they've softened it."
"15172760","15176400"," I think that's the key that I think that's the key that Burry knew. "
"15176840","15177960"," Fire is like they softened."
"15178380","15179580"," They did the soft landing."
"15180200","15183620"," So even when we get down there, it's not going to be what we thought it was going to be. "
"15196720","15198080"," Trust me, I wanted it, man."
"15198340","15203040"," Like, oh, man, dude, if I could have gotten that fucking last leg down, man, 1600 dude."
"15203860","15207140"," Probably sell my wife, kids, dog, sell the fucking houses. "
"15207660","15209120"," I'd fucking sell my fucking vehicles."
"15210260","15212720"," I'd sell my own clothes and walk around naked and buy all of it."
"15213280","15214600"," Every last bit of it. "
"15215800","15218420"," Handed off to my kids that I just sold to be like, you're rich now."
"15220900","15223360"," I don't think I know a single bull with money."
"15223860","15226420"," Not a single one that wasn't hoping for that. "
"15227100","15229140"," I mean, I wanted 65 bucks on Tesla."
"15231260","15233220"," You can't scare me with a good time."
"15237060","15238740"," I think Diamond wanted it. "
"15238780","15240600"," I think everybody wanted like that bloodbath."
"15243540","15245560"," All it is is greed right by the dip."
"15246280","15247660"," It always turns into that. "
"15248940","15252660"," I think two years ago, I was talking to Winky and he's like, he's like a fucking hate Tesla."
"15253500","15255120"," Like, how about 65 dollars?"
"15255260","15255580"," Do you hate it?"
"15255660","15259120"," Then he's like, no, actually, I don't."
"15260820","15262440"," I think everybody has a price. "
"15267960","15269000"," I hate Walmart."
"15269460","15269640"," You do?"
"15269980","15274300"," Would you buy Walmart for a dollar for like five minutes at four a.m. and on a Monday and"
"15274300","15274780"," a major cross?"
"15275180","15275280"," Crash?"
"15276360","15276840"," I love Walmart."
"15279600","15280360"," Yes, I know. "
"15280780","15281620"," I'm not a Walmart bull."
"15282720","15286500"," I still don't buy my shit there, but God damn it."
"15286540","15287260"," I support the company. "
"15302170","15304730"," Yes, everything you want in hard to load up in hard assets."
"15315350","15315990"," Daddy's naked."
"15316150","15316790"," What's daddy doing?"
"15317230","15322750"," He's got a fucking tent in the backyard and fucking loading up on fucking spy. "
"15325370","15326590"," That's everybody, wouldn't it?"
"15334250","15339050"," We got like two years ago, friends and I were all like, we're all charting this stuff out."
"15339190","15342350"," We're all like, man, if we can get down there to 1600, there'd be fucking baller."
"15343550","15347370"," If we can get 2200, that'd be like, we got 5% chance of this. "
"15347490","15348830"," We got 15% chance of that."
"15349430","15352230"," We got a 35% chance of this, 50% chance of that."
"15354110","15355090"," Like, that's the truth. "
"15355370","15358390"," As we were rolling over, I was like, let's get some targets going."
"15360150","15362290"," Let's get some places to buy some cheap shit."
"15368760","15370240"," I'm going to fucking love to buy that. "
"15370400","15370860"," Harpy."
"15372820","15374120"," They're screwing us, man."
"15374620","15375860"," They're fucking screwing us. "
"15382820","15383820"," They really are."
"15384040","15384600"," They're jacking us."
"15385080","15386840"," We ain't getting the bottom we thought we were. "
"15389980","15395920"," And take that 1600 and fucking, take that 1600 everybody was talking about and kiss that shit"
"15395920","15396180"," goodbye."
"15396740","15397820"," That shit's gone."
"15398960","15399400"," 2000. "
"15399980","15400600"," That's your best bet."
"15400860","15403460"," That'd be like, it's like the guy from Las Vegas."
"15404560","15406220"," And we got a Mona Lisa here, the original. "
"15406960","15408040"," It's worth 10 million."
"15408260","15409500"," I can give you $5 for it."
"15415280","15417580"," Slide that over for you so you can still see it. "
"15420060","15423660"," Be conscious or be careful as we go to this weekend close here."
"15424120","15425920"," It's now two o'clock in the afternoon, two hours left."
"15426720","15428740"," Remember to get these rolls into the end of the day. "
"15429480","15430900"," Be careful of that."
"15431100","15432740"," They love selling this right now."
"15432900","15435540"," This three hour, I mean this fucking HT, man. "
"15436140","15437760"," They love selling this."
"15438000","15441880"," So just be aware of it and see the reversal candle there."
"15441980","15443020"," This is called the tweezer. "
"15443600","15445000"," One big green, one big red."
"15445680","15448720"," They don't always pan out, but if you're traditional charters, you know what these are."
"15450600","15452320"," And they're going to try to sell this right now. "
"15452320","15455680"," This has been the place that all sellers step in right here in this candle."
"15456420","15457240"," Be aware of it."
"15460080","15461480"," I'll even write it out there for you. "
"15462120","15465560"," All week long, every day like clockwork, sellers right here."
"15467120","15469140"," Every day this week, you've written this in here, right?"
"15469560","15469880"," Every day."
"15470620","15471440"," For it happens. "
"15471860","15474940"," They have missed it, because it wasn't paying attention to the chart, but that's where sellers step"
"15474940","15476240"," in every single time."
"15477140","15481340"," Hit the early trigger, step in, put the short in, and you hold it until Monday or tomorrow."
"15492850","15497150"," If you're looking to buy calls here, the best place to buy calls is after the breakup and the"
"15497150","15498370"," confirmation to the upside. "
"15499370","15501230"," So you'll get an initial push down."
"15502150","15504830"," This white line will come up and this red line will come up."
"15506750","15508190"," That's your next entry as a bull. "
"15511390","15512930"," Here, I'll draw it out for you."
"15517210","15520270"," If you're going to buy calls as a bull here, wait a minute."
"15524510","15525190"," Drawings. "
"15528530","15530170"," You'll be looking for the retest."
"15545530","15547050"," Buy the bounce."
"15549150","15550110"," Not bounce. "
"15551350","15551610"," Bounce."
"15553270","15554190"," Right there."
"15557520","15558520"," Summer in there. "
"15559520","15563000"," I got to check and see where the early trigger is."
"15563900","15566280"," For right now, this is where you get cut up."
"15566620","15568140"," Like this is no man's land in here. "
"15568840","15572500"," If you're a bear, you could have bought this one here with a stop above it."
"15573920","15575300"," What a bear is looking for."
"15575300","15576820"," So I'm looking to buy this one right here. "
"15577760","15583800"," What a bear is looking for is a bear to enter a trade."
"15583960","15588400"," If you missed this one here as a bear, you are looking for."
"15591280","15597260"," Come on now. "
"15598220","15599020"," What the fuck?"
"15606960","15608580"," The downside right there."
"15611040","15612600"," That looks like dog shit."
"15613660","15614700"," It's not really what it looks like. "
"15633940","15635060"," Yeah, this looks horrible."
"15639870","15640710"," Back up."
"15641490","15642470"," It's actually not even three. "
"15643170","15643990"," It just looks like shit."
"15645410","15646530"," It's out of the way for you."
"15647210","15648030"," That's what I want to buy. "
"15654410","15656530"," You get one quick dip down there."
"15657670","15658490"," Failure here."
"15662550","15663490"," Right there. "
"15664310","15664530"," There."
"15678070","15685670"," If you missed this trade here as a seller, you're going to be looking to enter only after"
"15685670","15687190"," confirmation right there."
"15697590","15698830"," Right right there. "
"15699650","15700230"," That'll be your turn."
"15700390","15701250"," This is the juice of the trade."
"15729240","15729820"," Oh, yeah. "
"15730020","15730900"," So this is what I want to buy."
"15733200","15734780"," So I'll show you guys what I want to buy."
"15736020","15740280"," I want to buy that because unless you entered right here. "
"15741960","15743860"," This is a chop zone."
"15745220","15746920"," Unless there's a break below it."
"15747960","15749560"," It's going to be a trap for the bears. "
"15750300","15752720"," So I'm looking for the trap on bears here."
"15753000","15755440"," So I'm looking for like a green bar right here."
"15756160","15757300"," Trap these bears in. "
"15758580","15760700"," So I wouldn't take a trade in here."
"15761020","15762660"," Like this area right here personally."
"15763620","15765080"," This is the zone of death in here. "
"15766300","15767480"," I want nothing to do with it."
"15801110","15802630"," See the rug pull right here."
"15802730","15803890"," Try to pull that rug on us. "
"15804570","15805270"," See you right there."
"15808960","15811580"," I'm going to break right below and then start to reject."
"15812320","15813780"," I'm going to show it to you right here. "
"15814640","15816360"," It's a little pin strike right there."
"15818800","15820380"," See that little thing right there."
"15825470","15827570"," That's the last layer right there. "
"15827670","15828550"," They want to rug pull that."
"15830310","15832230"," So if that doesn't get rug pulled."
"15834110","15836230"," If they don't pull this rug out. "
"15837550","15839330"," I'm going to trap bear down there."
"15852090","15852490"," Phew."
"15853470","15853870"," Pired. "
"15854690","15855310"," We ran out of coffee."
"15855590","15856470"," Oh, I got some more coffee right here."
"15864970","15866150"," I keep my eye right here. "
"15866830","15867830"," You know what I am looking for?"
"15871770","15873330"," So see this rug pull right here."
"15874070","15874750"," They can pull this."
"15875710","15878410"," Sometimes you'll see hidden orders step in. "
"15878930","15881050"," You'll see a big orange bar step in right here."
"15881730","15883910"," If you see the big orange bar that steps in."
"15884590","15886330"," Those hidden buyers right hidden demand. "
"15887610","15889730"," I'll know it and I'll pull the trigger and buy some calls."
"15890230","15891570"," Now if you see that red bar disappear."
"15892510","15894050"," It's going to signal you that we're going to go to the downside. "
"15896330","15898410"," Now this bar right here they want to get underneath."
"15900770","15902750"," We're going to get underneath here and begin to reject."
"15903170","15904570"," So you'll see like a red bar. "
"15907650","15908890"," You want to see like a break."
"15911470","15913210"," You want to see a small green bar."
"15915050","15915990"," With a failure. "
"15919740","15920760"," No will right."
"15921460","15922220"," No buyer will."
"15922820","15923880"," Let's see a red bar right here. "
"15924240","15926300"," Bam, bam, bam, bam to the downside."
"15929220","15931720"," You want to see like a failure of demand here."
"15935400","15936540"," This is a five minute bar. "
"15936660","15940080"," You can do this on a one minute too but five minutes nice and slow for you."
"15940400","15940440"," Easy."
"15944250","15946090"," You see how you see how that demand. "
"15947250","15952050"," See how this see how right here these buyers not enough buyers for the number of sellers."
"15953030","15956230"," More sellers than buyers right now grinding through these buyers."
"15957370","15958610"," More sellers than buyers. "
"15962710","15964450"," Next demand is lower right."
"15971930","15973990"," Look for the next place of interest down here."
"15975610","15976710"," 439 down here. "
"15980990","15982010"," And down here."
"15982150","15983570"," So my cursor down here right down here."
"15985530","15986650"," 450 I think. "
"15986730","15987450"," I can't read it from here."
"15988030","15989610"," It's not a little pit stop over here."
"15989770","15991350"," There's some pit stoppage over here too. "
"15991350","15992430"," A little bit of grinding here."
"15993450","15996530"," Right down there's the real next real big demand is down here."
"16004910","16007150"," Sell a little green flicker and now the red. "
"16007690","16008930"," A little bit of a battle here."
"16009070","16011030"," I'm going to start turning around and start running it down."
"16012590","16013030"," Ready?"
"16014610","16028260"," You see"
"16028260","16029880"," the orange bar stepping in right now. "
"16029880","16033140"," You see the to see the hidden orange bar stepping in."
"16050640","16051440"," Just a note."
"16051660","16055720"," There's 463,000 calls at 52 cents. "
"16056860","16058180"," Everyone's on the call side."
"16058620","16060100"," Those are a little too priced."
"16060100","16061040"," They need to be worn down. "
"16061540","16065640"," Sellers probably have the ability to take this down."
"16065840","16069440"," So we'll see a lot of juice on the call side right now."
"16117480","16119160"," So there's my rant on. "
"16119580","16121220"," There's my rant on market crash."
"16126320","16127880"," Nice, nice blood right here."
"16129000","16130120"," Starting to get some rejection. "
"16130640","16131740"," No will from the buy side."
"16140900","16142080"," Take a look in the background."
"16143000","16143620"," VIX is starting. "
"16144040","16146040"," We've got a bull flag on VIX forming right now."
"16147260","16148200"," You're ready for some blood."
"16151460","16152520"," I'm going to buy some puts here. "
"16152700","16152840"," Hold on."
"16159960","16161820"," They're saying we're not getting all the way down there."
"16161940","16162300"," Be careful. "
"16162460","16164360"," Our downside target might not be 433."
"16164620","16166300"," 433 is only 12 cents right now."
"16169640","16171020"," They don't want to fucking pay him. "
"16172740","16174680"," Dude, I wonder if they're going to pin this into the close."
"16175240","16176520"," I would do want to show you guys something here."
"16177840","16179000"," This downside move. "
"16181140","16183340"," Dude, I wonder if they pin us."
"16184580","16186000"," Just grind this right here."
"16189160","16191040"," I'm looking at these 433s. "
"16191360","16192460"," They're only 12 cents."
"16194440","16197060"," I want them to go to like 36 or something."
"16197880","16199600"," And the price isn't moving a lot right now. "
"16202940","16205980"," And I wonder if they pin this whole fucking thing into the close."
"16209720","16211780"," Or maybe just a dip to here and then up."
"16215960","16218620"," Fucking dude, VIX wants to fuck really bad too. "
"16218980","16221120"," VIX wants to fucking destroy right now."
"16222740","16224640"," VIX wants to rip some heads off."
"16229510","16230290"," Yeah, it does. "
"16230650","16232170"," VIX wants to go up there and fuck."
"16258290","16259590"," I've got something set up."
"16259710","16260430"," I haven't bought them yet. "
"16262870","16263650"," Careful of it."
"16263770","16265470"," I'm looking at 433Ps."
"16267250","16271930"," VIX needs to come back down and test 12.95. But look for something like this. "
"16274230","16276870"," A quick rip and then a failure and down."
"16277250","16278170"," So somewhere in here."
"16282970","16285090"," 433s are at a P's by the way. "
"16285250","16286750"," It puts 11 cents."
"16297720","16299740"," 12 cents on the ask."
"16317040","16319800"," I'm on 13 cents on 433Ps. "
"16321100","16324200"," Even if I get squeezed a lot, some more added 20 contracts."
"16328320","16331140"," Oh, if I got a green bar here, I'm going to have to add another 20."
"16344170","16346190"," Keep the fucking bare music for these guys. "
"16359130","16360630"," Mmm, bare music, huh?"
"16363830","16366050"," I'm going to read some bare music off here."
"16366050","16366630"," Let's turn on."
"16366790","16368450"," Let's go to the one minute to make it fun. "
"16372850","16374090"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"16376170","16377210"," That looks like shit."
"16377270","16378010"," It's like right here. "
"16384340","16385720"," Let's make it look sexy at least."
"16392180","16393820"," If we turn some jams on."
"16396599","16397160"," Oof. "
"16411419","16411980"," There."
"16413040","16413939"," There's a cross."
"16417320","16418599"," There's a blast down. "
"16419439","16420460"," There it is right there."
"16422000","16422460"," Green bar up."
"16423460","16424240"," Rip this shit down. "
"16431020","16433619"," We'll cue some music early, okay?"
"16434599","16435439"," Easy here."
"16435720","16439660"," I don't normally play this until it confirms, but turn some shit on."
"16444880","16447700"," We'll give him some theme music for more down. "
"16447960","16448140"," We'll see."
"16448360","16450660"," We'll turn it off, though, if this fucking shit turns around."
"16451880","16453279"," Cut the music for the bears. "
"16470270","16472770"," Remember you have to reject this cross here."
"16476890","16478470"," Just raise it up because it's moving."
"16479349","16480050"," Right there. "
"16480050","16480150"," There."
"16503840","16505460"," This bar was attached."
"16505740","16506740"," It would just follow along. "
"16513140","16514300"," Come on, bears."
"16517580","16528939"," The only"
"16528939","16530900"," thing bears can sell is futures."
"16553119","16554700"," Really headed out of the hotel lobby. "
"16556520","16562040"," What the fuck are these guys doing playing video games?"
"16565160","16574090"," Remember, this is where the sellers are up here."
"16576570","16580869"," I'm going to try something different today."
"16581730","16582790"," See what else they have in here. "
"16588040","16590180"," We're going to test out some new music."
"16595599","16597740"," If we don't like it, we're not going to play it ever again."

"16948950","16950250"," You wherever these sellers are here, right?"
"16952490","16954130"," You could say, well, I had to do it. "
"16954130","16955110"," I waited for confirmation."
"16956250","16958470"," I got my first rejection to the down side."
"16958470","16961110"," I'm now entering the downside, right?"
"16962410","16963930"," Where are the stops going to be?"
"16964050","16964510"," Are they up here?"
"16964510","16968010"," or are they up here or are they up here, right?"
"16968110","16973190"," So let's say I'm entering right here and then I say, okay, I'm gonna DC this, this, and this, and"
"16973190","16974550"," my stops are above here. "
"16975270","16976910"," But you should be managing these trades."
"16977450","16978750"," I don't care if we continue down here."
"16979230","16984690"," If you're a bear or seller, you have to manage this position, does that make sense to you?"
"16986850","16990370"," Ooh, ooh, but I want you to think about that. "
"16990570","16994530"," I know we're going down, but I want you to think about how you manage your position."
"16995210","16998050"," It's, you should never be in this stream ever."
"16999790","17007790"," Like I took a put and it turned on me and I never cut or DC aid and cut or"
"17007790","17008490"," any of that stuff. "
"17009830","17011790"," Even reverses down here, does that make sense?"
"17012710","17017230"," So when you're making these positions and you're taking, making a decision, you should be thinking"
"17017230","17026030"," out, number one, where is it going, when is it going, what's my target and where am I going to"
"17026030","17027170"," manage the position above?"
"17027610","17028030"," Does that make sense?"
"17028570","17040370"," So I pre-plan and pre-think my position, I enter and I manage the said position throughout"
"17040370","17041610"," being in the trade."
"17042610","17043030"," Does that make sense?"
"17043990","17045270"," So you're managing your trade."
"17045890","17046790"," Where am I gonna take profit?"
"17047830","17049210"," How many runners do I leave on?"
"17049730","17050890"," These are puts, they suck. "
"17051670","17054930"," Like they'll be like 10 cents, 40 cents, then they're back to 10 cents in a minute."
"17055690","17058990"," So you have to manage this whole position for selling."
"17060230","17064490"," You can't just be like, I'm gonna dime in hand until the end of the fucking day or they go"
"17064490","17064930"," to zero. "
"17065830","17067530"," I get to manage your entire position."
"17067810","17072810"," Know where you are in the position and know where you cut your losses or you break even or"
"17072810","17073070"," whatever."
"17073890","17076190"," If this was the red bar down right now, right?"
"17077110","17080990"," I don't know why I'm using orange, but let's say we red bar this down. "
"17081230","17084030"," Bam, bam, bam."
"17085730","17092010"," And you forget to take profit and then it starts to turn up on you."
"17092590","17099650"," And you're like, now even, let's say right here, you still gotta sell. "
"17100650","17102130"," Fuck you, you didn't take your money and run?"
"17103210","17104390"," Not their fucking fault."
"17105970","17106850"," Does that make sense?"
"17127260","17131740"," Yeah, I want that, like there shouldn't be any, like sometimes you'll see me do it."
"17131920","17136440"," I'll lose a lot of money, but when I lose a lot of money, it's either a, I'm tired, b,"
"17136700","17137160"," I'm hungover. "
"17139420","17143100"," Or I believe in the trade and I'm like, fuck you, I'm staying in it, at least you know the"
"17143100","17143420"," reason."
"17144920","17148480"," But most of the time when I take an L here, you'll see me, I'll be like, I lost three"
"17148480","17148860"," pennies."
"17149020","17150020"," Oh, I lost six pennies. "
"17150840","17152700"," You'll sometimes see me see Greek, get greedy."
"17153460","17154440"," I'm up fucking 80%."
"17155140","17156080"," I'm gonna let it ride. "
"17156540","17158380"," Then it goes all the way to fuck back down, right?"
"17159840","17161700"," But you should be managing your positions."
"17162120","17164960"," Whenever you see me trade and sloppy, you can probably be like, hey, he's tired."
"17166420","17167620"," He didn't take the money and run. "
"17170260","17175200"," You know, so like if we trade up here, if we were to reverse right now at this moment, start"
"17175200","17179020"," cutting me out of the trade, I should sell, right?"
"17179840","17182260"," And look for repositioning to the downside up here, right?"
"17183260","17189520"," If I get cut up two or three times and I get the one hit, bam, then I make my"
"17189520","17190420"," money anyways, right?"
"17191060","17194220"," So make sure you're managing your positions."
"17208770","17210930"," This is relevant to any timeframe."
"17212410","17218450"," So if you're in an hour timeframe, a daily timeframe, you're upside down?"
"17219070","17224690"," Like we can do this same chart right here on an hourly chart, a daily chart. "
"17225550","17227770"," So if you're like, hey, I'm losing, I lost $100,000."
"17229690","17235890"," This is applicable in a one minute chart, a five minute chart, an hour chart, a day chart, a week"
"17235890","17236210"," chart."
"17239830","17250170"," We're gonna do some money. "
"17286130","17288530"," I fucking love David and I was trading with him."
"17288650","17290710"," He's trading with him for years."
"17291450","17292150"," Three, four years. "
"17293650","17294570"," Fucking great trader."
"17295550","17296610"," Fucking love that man."
"17310060","17311360"," He is real deal. "
"17332040","17333080"," I'm home, baby."
"17347720","17350100"," Trading 16 cents, 15 cents right now."
"17352570","17354450"," Not much here, not much juice being given. "
"17355030","17358010"," They're draining these fucking calls, but not enough."
"17358430","17361870"," Like the calls I called out earlier, they'll 38 cents."
"17362630","17365590"," They were like 52 cents, so a little while ago, they're at 38. "
"17366430","17373570"," It'd be nice to get them down to like 20 cents and close this put position, but I don't know."
"17374390","17376290"," Just gonna be like one more red fucking bar."
"17378570","17379690"," I don't know if I'm gonna get it. "
"17379750","17380710"," I'm gonna make it stopped out of this."
"17383070","17388950"," It's hard for, so we're stair stepping down right now in futures, they're doing it mechanically"
"17388950","17390230"," outside of markets."
"17391170","17393950"," It's a mixture of, it's a mixture of three things. "
"17395330","17399350"," I'm flat right now, so all that move right there, I'm still fucking flat right now."
"17399570","17401190"," Dude, I don't know why you fuck you guys' trade puts."
"17402370","17403330"," Fucking stupid. "
"17406110","17408570"," All that move and I've got a fucking flat."
"17416090","17424370"," I like shorting, shorting is fun, but puts suck, like options market puts, they print, but like"
"17424370","17426930"," what you gotta do to get on the print fucking blows."
"17432670","17442030"," So like, yeah, I'm looking at it right now. "
"17442410","17444970"," It's bouncing on it's fucking 27 and a five."
"17445390","17446390"," I don't know one minute."
"17451910","17453410"," Nah, it doesn't come down to timing. "
"17454110","17456610"," Puts are not built to be the same as calls."
"17457670","17459250"," You guys, I'm gonna try to get the history."
"17459450","17461150"," I still haven't found that fucking paper. "
"17461710","17470530"," There's a paper that discusses the history of stocks, shares, stocks, calls and puts and the"
"17470530","17471110"," history of it."
"17471390","17472210"," And shorting too."
"17473010","17476430"," Do you guys know that there was a time when you could only buy and sell shares?"
"17477090","17479450"," Do you guys know that there was a time when you couldn't buy a put?"
"17480090","17482610"," Some of you, I'm gonna bet 70% of you did not know that. "
"17484750","17489410"," They're not structured, they're structured as a hedge, not as a money maker."
"17490190","17496230"," Their entire incarnation was never meant for you to make money off them."
"17497030","17501730"," They're meant for unrealized losses on your underlying position. "
"17502450","17503030"," That's true."
"17503670","17505170"," I gotta find that shit for you guys."
"17505830","17508590"," So it inherently calls are built to make you money. "
"17511470","17515770"," Yeah, I know some of you know it, but I know you old fucks out there know it, but not"
"17515770","17516290"," all of you do."
"17516770","17518050"," Some of you are market historians."
"17519470","17521190"," I'm at 14 cents, I got a penny. "
"17524150","17526290"," 13 cents, I just took a penny on it."
"17526530","17529430"," I can't stand, can't stand puts."
"17530470","17535310"," I mean, they print hard and heavy, but they go to zero fucking nine out of 10 times too. "
"17535550","17538570"," So I like shorting."
"17538790","17539790"," I like being short."
"17540090","17540790"," I think that's fun. "
"17541250","17542230"," I like selling futures."
"17543270","17545630"," There's this weird thing going on right now."
"17545670","17547890"," You have like, it's not just GPM. "
"17548490","17549650"," There's a hedge in the market."
"17549650","17554850"," And what it does is it's stopping the upside movement in the market."
"17555310","17560230"," So there's like, if the market wants to go up right now, as you come into expiry of that JPM"
"17560230","17565570"," collar, it's going to retard the market wanting to go up. "
"17566230","17568090"," It doesn't guarantee it stops it."
"17568530","17569670"," It just wants to."
"17570630","17572510"," It's kind of like you running, right?"
"17573050","17575830"," And I'm wacking you in the leg as you're running, right?"
"17576070","17581070"," So you can probably still run if you had enough strength, but it will slow you down a little bit,"
"17581170","17581270"," right?"
"17582330","17588350"," If I hit your harder, or you don't have as much energy, you might not run and just start walking. "
"17588350","17589490"," You might just stop, right?"
"17590370","17597830"," So that's the intent behind the collar or part of the intent or an unintended but bonus content or"
"17597830","17604090"," bonus part of a collar is it acts as a retarder of volatility up and down."
"17605210","17609730"," As they come into expiry, price will be attracted to it."
"17610050","17611330"," But there's some other shit going on. "
"17611970","17618570"," The higher we go, the more JPM loses and other banks lose on that hedge."
"17619550","17624230"," So not only is it an attractor, it's kind of a magnet kind of not, but only that you've got"
"17624230","17629670"," banks out there that are working against it from going up to actively into OPEX."
"17630190","17637330"," Then you have sellers that know that the dealer, because there's so much demand in the market at"
"17637330","17642650"," the same time, that dealer's countering the upside trade in futures. "
"17643670","17645490"," And then you've got traders that know this."
"17646150","17649830"," So we're gonna amplify this every time that we can inside futures."
"17650190","17656530"," Banks know this that they can actually amplify a low volume market. "
"17657150","17663650"," We have a low volume market right now this week so they can steer seppas down in the after hours"
"17663650","17665210"," pre-market blowbacks."
"17667090","17670810"," So you have all these things working against you into next week."
"17672770","17674070"," Now does that always work?"
"17674430","17680950"," Fuck no, if we're in like a liquid market like QE, we will blow right by and just keep going. "
"17681570","17684190"," It'll be violence heading into quarterly OPEXes."
"17684890","17691030"," Like we have violent moves up and down, wam, wam, wam, but we can break free of that."
"17692210","17697910"," You know who's the really good at this is, what's his name from Bridgewater?"
"17699470","17702210"," Damn spring knows a lot about this, the mechanics of it. "
"17702310","17707810"," How it's like you can tell, you can sell someone this is the mechanics of it, but depending on"
"17707810","17710550"," what's going on in the market, it impacts the mechanics of it."
"17712550","17722390"," Trading down right now, $4.33.50. Target down below $4.33. We also"
"17722390","17732940"," have a previous low down here at $4.32.71. And we got another one down here, $4.32, $4 "
"17732940","17738000",".84, $4.32.71. Trying to clean those both these targets up for you right here."
"17748930","17757770"," Yeah, Andy Constant, he does a really good job because he explains it very well and people get"
"17757770","17758750"," pissed off at him. "
"17760290","17763310"," People get mad at him and they're like, that guy doesn't know what he's talking about."
"17763550","17769390"," That guy knows exactly what he's talking about, but it changes so much with the dynamics of the"
"17769390","17774510"," market that you come back to, explain it to people and they're like, how are you wrong?"
"17774850","17778250"," And he was right, he was absolutely fucking right."
"17779030","17784530"," But the mechanics of the market dictate oftentimes how these things work themselves out. "
"17786310","17791450"," It's a hard thing to pin down and say, it's this one thing."
"17799860","17801200"," We're gonna play some more beer music."
"17801360","17802140"," Let's try another song out. "
"17807470","17808530"," Let's try this one."
"17828500","17831980"," I don't even know what that fucking music, I gotta get better music."
"17833620","17839620"," I don't even know what that is. "
"17849020","17850800"," That's some Scarface shit right there."
"17868180","17870480"," Yeah, watch that yellow, that red fucking line."
"17870560","17873880"," You like that red line, you dirty, you like that red line, you'd like it, don't you?"
"17874700","17875880"," I know you like that red line. "
"17875980","17878400"," Let me extend that red line for you, Mr. Sexy, right there."
"17914240","17915320"," What to do here?"
"17915600","17917800"," I already set it up for you, like way up here."
"17918600","17922600"," I popped that in, told you the sellers are up there, told you had a tweezer up here, what more"
"17922600","17922980"," you need?"
"17925800","17930100"," Who is that, DJ dunks, more calls?"
"17930440","17933140"," I don't know, like this is cut, so this red box. "
"17933340","17936060"," So these two red lines right here, you need to see a."
"17936860","17939300"," So this red line, good question actually."
"17939620","17942600"," So this right here should be yellow, so you can see them."
"17944860","17949160"," You're looking for another rejection here for the next leg, you're looking for this. "
"17952380","17953640"," Tag this down here."
"17956960","17964360"," If you're already short, you should be lowering your stops, right, remember the enter here?"
"17965240","17967880"," Remember the confirmation trade right here?"
"17969160","17973220"," Remember the big money to the downside and the rejection here, when we talked about that?"
"17975620","17976520"," Big money trade?"
"17986940","17992060"," Yeah, so DJ dunks, what are you looking for here?"
"17996260","18000580"," It's a good question, so DJ dunks, like, say bye puts here, fuck no, man, too late."
"18001780","18006140"," But what it does mean is, where do we bounce?"
"18009140","18013400"," I know for a fact, we're gonna bounce, not a fact, but we're gonna bounce right here. "
"18016080","18018040"," That's what I'm looking for the bounce right there."
"18018560","18020260"," Where is the rejection right here?"
"18028540","18029520"," It's a good question."
"18031180","18031720"," Yeah. "
"18057520","18060340"," Come on down for daddy."
"18062740","18067380"," 4.33, he's trading 31 and 32 cents."

"18098440","18098440"," trading 31 and 32. "
"18118360","18118900"," So, we're gonna bounce right here."
"18118900","18119720"," Not a bad trade, right?"
"18121160","18123640"," As we come down here, start, take profit."
"18127400","18129780"," This is all the extra juice down here. "
"18133040","18135560"," As we take juice, the most of the money is right here."

"18866230","18875650"," strong support And I want you to look at a range for next week Of 435"
"18875650","18884130"," and 427 26 If you're make trying to make a leg so if you looking for next week, I'm gonna"
"18884130","18891210"," expect range bound in here For next week if we get above at any point or if that or if"
"18891210","18898730"," that hourly trigger comes down watch this hourly trigger This comes down we catch a bounce You"

"18962950","18968530"," the hold above the hourly trigger, but they told us no they said fuck you So I'm gonna park this"
"18968530","18977370"," bus in my opinion right in here Market will then be free after the 30th to either go down and"
"18977370","18986270"," tack that weekly To make its run higher to 465 I think I got that wrong 456 I think on"
"18986270","18992050"," the quarterly high So be looking for this into the 30th look for some weakness down here But this"
"18992050","18997710"," will likely be like 415 at that point maybe 420 at that point because the time passes will be"
"18997710","19007690"," higher One thing of note here as we come into this week It's upcoming week right here one"
"19007690","19012770"," thing to note if at any point we break above and trade above that trigger that hourly trigger We"
"19012770","19018110"," will trade this if at any point we break below and confirm the move lower We will trade below but"
"19018110","19027950"," for next week right now Expectations for next week expect a high of 430 435 and a low of 428"
"19029790","19039090"," 428 434 35 or next week you may get some outside of the range You might get a little bit"
"19039090","19044930"," of this you might get a little bit of that, but this is your range for next week What do"
"19044930","19046970"," I expect us to open at on Monday?"
"19048170","19055930"," This is a tough one This is a tough one It would not shock me to see like some kind"
"19055930","19063070"," of bloodbath down here into futures open on Monday, but then a ripper On Monday right there"
"19063070","19066150"," something like this I'd be if you're not a futures trader."
"19066350","19071570"," It's hard for you to trade this If you get some kind of bounce on the morning of Monday, and"
"19071570","19077710"," then you're kind of getting fucked on puts that you get fucked on on theta burn I Don't know what"
"19077710","19082590"," to say to you on this is no real calls that you can take here Were you were you not"
"19082590","19085230"," gonna get hurt like spreads don't work next week?"

"19107950","19113750"," like that run that spread right into Into Wednesday a Wednesday expiry. "
"19114030","19118110"," So that's my best trade I think I got for next week if you guys have better trades for next"
"19118110","19122790"," week outside of a fly Let me know but I think a fly for the next week and the Wednesday"

"19359610","19362030"," If you trade the calls, it's like a five minute trade."
"19362770","19364450"," Fifteen minute trade at that best. "
"19365770","19368770"," There's like a trade from the bounce from here to here."

"19402570","19407130"," You'd be in like, I'd buy a 10 cent call, let's say, and you'd buy it at 12."
"19407950","19408750"," It'd go to like 17."
"19409650","19410850"," I'd be selling 17. "
"19411110","19413690"," It would reverse down on you to 12 or 14."
"19414490","19415990"," You'd be up a penny or two."
"19416190","19419070"," And then by the time you hit the button, you'd be, fuck, I'm losing money. "
"19419990","19420750"," I'm making 70%."
"19421310","19422610"," You're making fucking zero."

"19453440","19453880"," I wasn't doing it."

"19455340","19456040"," I was trading a one minute."
"19456260","19460920"," The problem with trading the one minute with you guys is you guys get scared."
"19461240","19466240"," And so if this is the five minutes of slower chart, I can be like, yeah, they're not seeing the"
"19466240","19468440"," red bars between here and here or the green bars. "
"19468500","19470800"," They're not seeing them."

"19734970","19737070"," Yeah, it could retrace 27478."
"19738950","19740450"," It should go up, man. "
"19740590","19743150"," Weekends like you want to see the bounce here slam up in there."
"19743930","19747710"," But there should be retraced, but at some point, because we're already up here now, right?"
"19749350","19751530"," So, let's delete everything."
"19752570","19759960"," Okay, so right now, I should have put those lines back up there. "
"19760100","19760780"," We tagged this one."
"19760940","19761260"," Wait a minute."
"19761360","19762140"," Oh, sorry about brother. "
"19762360","19763520"," You guys can't see this."
"19764200","19764800"," Sorry, Henry."
"19765740","19766680"," We tagged it, right?"

"19804530","19806590"," I'll be honest with you."
"19806590","19810650"," This is right here. "
"19811910","19820730"," With that said, any dip that you see between 27, 917, you buy it."
"19820990","19823770"," Anything over 32, 390 is a buy."
"19825290","19826530"," So buy. "
"19829750","19832050"," And I don't mean like dip your wick up there."
"19832210","19833610"," I ain't talking about this bullshit."
"19834790","19836450"," Like, oh, yeah, you're buying that. "
"19836530","19837370"," You ain't buying that."
"19837570","19840470"," You're buying like up, hold, and then the leg up."
"19840710","19841930"," You buy that right there. "
"19843590","19844030"," Consolidation."
"19844830","19846110"," Confirmation, you buy that."
"19848230","19850490"," If you just get the wick up here, right?"
"19850750","19851670"," Go up there with the wick. "
"19852350","19854890"," Look for the dip buy again on 27, 19."
"19855510","19856030"," Bam, do it again."
"19856750","19857590"," Bam, do it again. "
"19857930","19858650"," Bam, do it again."
"19859550","19861470"," The moment that it sits up here."
"19861470","19863490"," On 32, 9."
"19864450","19865970"," 32, 390. "
"19869230","19873430"," We're going for 3723 or 37723."
"19874110","19875510"," It is the weekend, man."
"19879130","19880990"," You want to take a snapshot of this?"
"19889150","19891490"," I'm buying that right there. "
"19891490","19893130"," 27, 7, 19."
"19893410","19895130"," I'm going to show you a couple different paths here."
"19949570","19950770"," Take a snap of that. "
"19950990","19952350"," You're buying this right here."
"19953170","19954850"," You're buying this right here."
"19955110","19956370"," You're selling this right here. "
"19957110","19961670"," If this consolidates, another buy to the upside with a target of 3723."
"19962490","19963650"," I'm very bullish here, man."
"19963890","19970270"," So my preferred buy, if I had one, would be 28, 570 or so. "
"19972250","19972990"," There's your Bitcoin."
"19973770","19975410"," Oh, how's that spooze doing?"
"19975410","19976670"," Is it going up there to that orange box?"
"19977490","19978810"," Kind of, or he did, didn't it?"
"19980650","19983370"," Okay, so you've got my weekly outlook for next week."
"19984230","19985710"," It's 3.16 in the afternoon. "

"19987510","19988870"," You got your bounce trade down below."
"19991510","19995470"," Hopefully you set yourself up for the rest of the week on some flies."

"20019750","20020710"," to say. "

"20103760","20107320"," I've been here, but you know that I'm off through another shit and not able to pay close attention"
"20107320","20108040"," to the market."
"20108620","20110220"," So I apologize to you for that."
"20110220","20111620"," You got me all day long today. "
"20112060","20115500"," I was supposed to do some work today, and instead I'm like, yeah, fucking, I'll trade with these"
"20115500","20116280"," guys all day long."
"20116340","20116760"," I love them."
"20118520","20120420"," So we made a lot of money today. "
"20120500","20121320"," So is it a good day?"
"20129080","20130580"," Yeah, I lost some money on those two."
"20130720","20134480"," I think both I and Winky lost some change."
"20134540","20137140"," I lost some money on that trade. "
"20137700","20138780"," I didn't even break even either."
"20138780","20139640"," I was up on it."
"20141620","20145240"," Maybe lost like six or seven hundred bucks, but I had like a hundred calls. "
"20145520","20149800"," I took a bunch off at 51, and then this morning they got fucking torched."
"20155240","20156340"," 930 every morning."
"20157180","20158460"," Three winning trades today. "
"20159200","20162840"," Matter of fact, if you were a bull up here, you should have known better."
"20163100","20163600"," I told you."
"20163860","20166000"," So you get no excuses today. "
"20166740","20167220"," Zero."
"20169460","20175730"," Do I think Nvidia breaks down soon?"
"20177210","20177650"," No."
"20179110","20180090"," No, I don't. "
"20181370","20183430"," I don't know how you're at what you mean by that."
"20184770","20187270"," Do I think that it underperforms possibly?"
"20188230","20189770"," I don't think the market breaks down."
"20190130","20192270"," I'm going to be I'm going to truthful with all the out there. "
"20192710","20193590"," I went through this earlier."
"20194130","20197770"," If we get down to that daily trigger in that weekly trailer, weekly or daily trigger."
"20198550","20200110"," I'm buying the fuck out of that. "
"20200350","20205650"," So if we become that bearish, we roll the market over."
"20205810","20207170"," We're going to know it's going to take time."
"20207970","20212510"," So if we become like if we begin to roll a market over, it's going to take one to three"
"20212510","20212750"," months. "
"20214290","20217070"," So you're going to you're going to have to be a lot of work to that happening."
"20217890","20221450"," So like somebody's if you have people out there saying this is the top."
"20222590","20226290"," Ask them what their number is because if their number is for 12. "
"20226290","20228250"," It was 3200."
"20229170","20230090"," You know what I'm saying?"
"20230370","20235910"," So like first off first thing you need to know is what is the pullback that you're talking about?"
"20236370","20238290"," What is the correction to you?"
"20239610","20241230"," What is your price on a correction?"
"20242050","20243950"," Or are you saying that's the top?"
"20244170","20246770"," We're going to roll this whole thing down and continue back to our."
"20247150","20251110"," You know, that was that was only a bear a bear rally. "
"20251490","20253190"," Those are like two distinct things."
"20253190","20255090"," Price matters and what people are saying."
"20256310","20262010"," And right now the market is not showing any way, shape or form that that that was only a bear"
"20262010","20262310"," rally. "
"20262590","20268690"," So right now as the market is is not showing bear market rally."
"20268810","20270870"," It is not showing that was the top."
"20271470","20276490"," If it does show it, I'll show it to you, but it's not showing that in any way, shape or"
"20276490","20276810"," form. "
"20276810","20281430"," So if anything, you're looking for a modest pullback to the daily trigger."
"20282090","20284050"," Possible correction to the weekly trigger."
"20284610","20289850"," And that weekly trigger right now is that for 12, 4, 14, and it's going to keep coming up. "
"20290050","20293310"," It'll be like for 15, 4, 20 by the time you get there."
"20293490","20298350"," So if you're like, if you see a bear out there go, we had a correction at 4, 20."
"20299470","20300430"," We're at 4, 32. "
"20302070","20304730"," You know, it's not like the goal post."
"20304730","20305910"," I always remember the goal posts."
"20307110","20309790"," So, but we're not in crash territory yet. "
"20310170","20315470"," And if we do, if we go into crash territory, I'll let you know if that happens and you'll be"
"20315470","20316850"," able to make a bank on that trade."
"20318050","20321050"," Right now you're in full run."
"20322410","20322530"," Trading. "
"20323510","20328610"," Until that ends, we'll go into bear bear market trading."
"20329130","20331850"," We're not in bear market trading right now, no matter what anybody tells you."
"20332410","20332890"," Sorry. "
"20335750","20337290"," We'll end video like crash."
"20337870","20337970"," No."
"20339930","20345550"," And VDA will likely get a dip by or shouldn't even say we'll likely get a dip by. "
"20345650","20347010"," It's being bought right now."
"20347590","20349570"," This whole week is being bought."
"20350410","20353530"," All of it is being bought every last bit of it. "
"20353810","20355330"," You can't get a leg down."
"20355690","20357510"," If you look at the correction so far."
"20358690","20362190"," The down move in cash market is like nothing. "
"20362950","20366610"," It's like all I'm asking for is like seven percent."
"20366670","20368910"," Can I get a seven percent pullback please seven."
"20369730","20371590"," And they can't even get that done in cash. "
"20372530","20376730"," It's all done in outside of normal normal market hours."
"20378770","20380730"," That's not indicative of a bear market."
"20380930","20386340"," That's indicative of a bull market or a bull run. "
"20386740","20388440"," I'll give it put it that way a bull run."
"20389200","20395340"," I'd like to see N VDA pullback to three ninety six."
"20396420","20397300"," Four hundred. "
"20398460","20399860"," Hopefully I'd like to see that."
"20400680","20403700"," If I can get N VDA back to four hundred and be happy."
"20404940","20406280"," Does that work for you?"
"20407840","20408920"," N VDA. "
"20409240","20410600"," Do you want more than that?"
"20411580","20413440"," Your first stop is four hundred."
"20414520","20418760"," Your next stop is three hundred."
"20418960","20419800"," Big leg down there. "
"20420720","20425080"," So your next leg for N VDA is I'm going to give it to you right now."
"20425220","20425660"," Three."
"20426520","20427320"," I said four hundred. "
"20428140","20432500"," Let's try a four hundred between three ninety and four hundred."
"20433240","20434500"," I think you'll be lucky to get it."
"20437720","20441380"," Do I think you get the full retracement up to three oh nine. "
"20443760","20446840"," I don't do tech leads the way."
"20447160","20448360"," So the answer to you is fuck."
"20448520","20451020"," No, I think you're going to be lucky to get like four. "
"20451420","20453540"," You'd be lucky to get three ninety to four lucky."
"20454260","20457040"," Can you take a short here on N VDA likely?"
"20457560","20457640"," Yes."
"20459520","20462180"," But if you think you're getting the big bloodbath at N VDA. "
"20462540","20463400"," I doubt it, man."
"20463660","20463940"," Dangerous."
"20464840","20465540"," You know here. "
"20465680","20466760"," Well, let's talk about N VDA."
"20467420","20471360"," That's a good one to look at."
"20474820","20476240"," Just look at as a base case. "
"20478140","20478580"," Okay."
"20480060","20482320"," If you're asking for the big move on N VDA."
"20482520","20484120"," Let's talk about the big move in N VDA. "
"20484500","20486060"," I'm going to give you rule fucking number one."
"20486220","20486340"," Okay."
"20488300","20491400"," Don't fucking short anything that's strong. "
"20492800","20493920"," Write that shit down."
"20494040","20495120"," Get a fucking piece of your bear."
"20495300","20496000"," Write this shit down. "
"20497080","20497520"," Serious."
"20498920","20500320"," Write this shit down."
"20501780","20503800"," Don't fucking short anything that's strong. "
"20505960","20508300"," You think you're getting 300 down here, right?"
"20508540","20510140"," You're like, we're going to race this big giant gap."
"20510300","20510740"," That's what you're thinking."
"20511320","20511780"," We might. "
"20512420","20513960"," I'm not anti this trade."
"20514320","20515720"," This is where the weekly is."
"20516740","20519200"," The weekly for N VDA is right there. "
"20520400","20522880"," The daily I think is right here."
"20524000","20525260"," And I know what you want."
"20525380","20526160"," You want this role. "
"20527000","20529680"," You want to come into the first and see a big bottom."
"20530220","20530660"," Correction."
"20531300","20532300"," Then we move higher. "
"20532680","20535480"," I bet when we're right here, you're going to say no we're crashing to, right?"
"20536000","20538440"," Not you personally, but you get my saying, right?"
"20538660","20539560"," I know that people want this."
"20539820","20540480"," I know you want it."
"20541380","20542760"," There's one problem here. "
"20543840","20545000"," Not a problem, but."
"20546080","20549780"," How long like do you have the time for this to happen before that happens?"
"20550500","20551540"," Do you have that time?"
"20552780","20554040"," That's October, right?"
"20555720","20559040"," But the rule number one though is don't short shit that's strong."
"20559340","20559500"," Ever. "
"20559840","20560400"," Just don't do it."
"20561080","20565320"," If you're looking for a shorting N VDA though, right?"
"20565460","20566700"," If you're like, hey, I want to short it though."
"20567300","20568960"," And fuck that company and fuck AI. "
"20569920","20573900"," I think the last time I discussed this, I specifically said to people."
"20574880","20578300"," AI is going to be a fad, but it's not going to be a fad the next month or three"
"20578300","20578540"," months."
"20578940","20580460"," And that has proved itself. "
"20580460","20587960"," So the one thing I want to show you here is that you want to see on a daily chart"
"20587960","20589020"," this right here."
"20592130","20601620"," You want to see something like this and you want to see price begin to roll down here."
"20606590","20608150"," There's that collapse right there. "
"20611100","20612980"," You will see something like this."
"20615900","20618420"," And this is the actual trade you take."
"20618420","20619700"," I'm going to explain why. "
"20623220","20625800"," We can draw this out back here."
"20626140","20627600"," We can draw it out back here."
"20627820","20629020"," We can draw it out back there. "
"20629200","20634880"," And you would have been wrong and lost all of your money and you'd be taking on a job."
"20636100","20642140"," So until you see this happen first, you don't have a down trade."
"20642880","20644240"," We haven't done this yet, right?"
"20644740","20647140"," This is called a high risk trade for a seller. "
"20647640","20649100"," You can take this trade."
"20650160","20656700"," These two bars, if this rejects, you can take that trade, right?"
"20656940","20659380"," If it begins to reject under here, you can take that trade."
"20659600","20661500"," What's called basically a three leg trade, right?"
"20662120","20666020"," One, a break under the six EMA and a daily, which we haven't done yet. "
"20667040","20668260"," Haven't even confirmed that move."
"20669220","20670320"," This is your second move."
"20670520","20671280"," This is your third move. "
"20671520","20674980"," You would actually exit the trade and you would re-enter here."
"20674980","20680900"," Now, for me, the best paying trade here is right here."
"20682000","20687440"," The best paying trade here is actually entering a rejection right here, because this one would"
"20687440","20689800"," signal an actual rolling over of the market. "
"20690060","20690920"," This is the blood trade."
"20692120","20695260"," This is when you start to go down and you bloodbath all this."
"20695900","20699100"," It's almost guaranteed to, it's really an 80% win rate. "
"20699100","20703280"," You will bloodbath all this and you will erase all that shit down there."
"20705260","20706360"," This is the money trade."
"20706920","20708700"," I just did one with you in a five minute chart. "
"20709400","20710440"," That's the money trade."
"20711080","20713120"," This in here is where you get fucked up."
"20713500","20714960"," This in here is where you get trapped. "
"20715880","20718220"," This in here is where you get ripped pieces."
"20719040","20720220"," They bounce on you there."
"20720440","20721540"," They bounce on you there. "
"20721800","20722820"," They bounce on you there."
"20723180","20729280"," Now, you can take these trades if you're like a surgeon, but that's where all your risk is."
"20729460","20731140"," You wake up on Monday and we're up there. "
"20731960","20733720"," These are all danger, danger, danger."
"20733960","20737480"," You can trade them like slam the sell button, slam the sell button, close them up."
"20738180","20740500"," But the monster trade here is right here. "
"20741480","20747080"," And until that roll comes, you can't call the top on NVDA."
"20747940","20748260"," You understand?"
"20749700","20755480"," As a matter of fact, we don't even have the close right now on, you need the close below this"
"20755480","20756280"," six EMA."
"20756980","20763800"," You need a close below 425.45. You need the open on Monday to be below 425.45. And then"
"20763800","20769960"," your target below is 483.29. Maybe you'll, maybe you'll, maybe you'll, maybe you'll break through"
"20769960","20770820"," slightly here. "
"20772220","20773800"," And then it'll boop, boop, boop, boop."
"20773940","20776360"," And you're looking for rejection for continuation of the downside."
"20777660","20779300"," Could even pull all the way up here. "
"20779380","20780620"," Then you come back down here to do it."
"20780780","20784120"," So there's a lot, lot of steps here to shorting NVDA."
"20784120","20786120"," And I personally don't like shorting it here. "
"20787380","20790140"," I like the, I don't mind the last short, the last few days."
"20790760","20793060"," Truthfully, you want the close under for that 430."
"20794220","20799240"," 425.45 and your target next week at 380.330 and a bounce around here. "
"20799680","20801600"," Now we've got macro shit going on next week."
"20802440","20804940"," So I would expect something like this into the first."
"20806140","20808240"," Now I expect a pin at some point right around 400. "
"20808620","20809440"," And here's the last part."
"20810760","20812460"," We got window dressing, right?"
"20812460","20813400"," A friend of quarter."
"20814220","20816020"," If they window dress this shit on you. "
"20816700","20819080"," And you wake up on Monday and we start trading above."
"20820020","20822300"," Remember that green box I drew you, that hourly trigger?"
"20823040","20824620"," We start window dressing next week."
"20824780","20825840"," You're going to get fucked up. "
"20828340","20829380"," So I don't know, man."
"20829760","20831920"," There are some pitfalls along the way."
"20832440","20835980"," If you want the short thing to short NVDA, there's a lot of work to be done. "
"20837360","20838280"," A ton of work."
"20838720","20839740"," A ton of fucking work."
"20841580","20844660"," I feel the guy that wants to say I call the top on NVDA. "
"20845980","20847840"," If you're like, well, I think this is it."
"20848160","20849960"," I hear that shit from people every day of the week."
"20850060","20851140"," I hear it every fucking day. "
"20851820","20852820"," And I'm going to tell you one thing."

"20887780","20888020"," No."
"20889140","20891420"," You have to be the one that calls the other part of it."
"20892320","20893720"," Like that part of it, right?"
"20894040","20895280"," Or wherever that is that rule?"

"20955660","20961880"," I could be down on Monday, but if you run that 10 times another 10 times You're gonna lose too"
"20961880","20968920"," many of those But if you want like the big short on NVDA, there's a lot of work that has"
