"166750","171230"," I was doing a bunch of research and then I had to do some some back end stuff for the"
"171230","171510"," stream. "
"172990","177410"," You're seeing a small sell off here to the bell or on the opening bell this morning."

"209920","212060"," to see the book map stream up. "
"212480","215420"," We've got some other surprises for you today and stuff for you to be looking at."
"217600","220820"," Believe it or not, there is some buying going on down here."
"221160","223580"," If you're just joining us right now, this is the pivot point. "
"224240","225920"," You know, the importance of this pivot point."
"228000","229260"," We'll talk about it a lot."
"229420","232660"," We're going to look at a large, a larger view of the market here in just a moment. "
"232820","238640"," We'll look at a one month and a five day and take a quick look so that when I get"
"238640","241760"," back here, you guys can have a better idea of where we stand for the day today."

"261280","264300"," We've got a just a lot of stuff heading into the month of December."
"264860","269380"," Later this morning, we'll talk about what I where I think that we're going for the next couple"
"269380","269680"," days."
"270240","275000"," The importance of Friday, the importance of December, what to expect. "
"275040","280000"," We can get a really ugly December and we can get an up month or an up part of December."
"280420","285860"," Some form of a Santa rally and there's also some kind of a possibility of a down December and a"
"285860","286440"," central rally."
"286640","289760"," So we'll look at all three of those options later this morning. "
"290360","290800"," I'm going to mute."
"291080","291880"," Oh, give me a second here."
"292580","295500"," I'm seeing some support step in right now. "
"298240","301600"," We're going to take a look briefly around the market on a one month chart."
"307880","310660"," You know, we're still within this larger channel, right?"
"313040","315260"," This is still an uptrend here."
"315660","322220"," There, there's a bear position or a bear positive that I'm bearish on today, believe it or not. "
"322900","327340"," So if you look at the chart here, I've kind of."
"327340","333060"," On a larger time frame, as we come into this two o'clock hour, we'll we'll start looking at some"
"333060","334000"," of these numbers in here."
"334480","339440"," I've got some retracement below your pivot levels here and then some retracement below the 50%"
"339440","343340"," retracement is down here right right at this trend, right?"
"343540","348680"," And then below here is right right around 61% is going to be touching the screen box down below"
"348680","349000"," here. "
"350380","352840"," So just like most of these meetings, right?"
"353080","357020"," We'll talk about more this all morning as soon as they get on the stream live here."
"357780","360480"," But I do want you to see these lower levels down below."
"362420","368540"," I would like to see some kind of a sell off today as a bullet rather by something down here"
"368540","369900"," or something down here. "
"370500","375640"," If they try to front run this, we'll talk about we'll talk about how the fed can be interpreted."
"376320","385800"," If we get a pump today, it could be because the market, the market is interpreting the fed"
"385800","386440"," loosening."
"386880","392360"," If they do that right, there could be a nasty role in the next two weeks where the market really"
"392360","393980"," starts selling off heavily. "
"395560","399740"," If you're a bull or I don't know, I guess if you're down if you're a bull or bear in"
"399740","402180"," this or a hawk or a dove on this."
"402360","408100"," But if you do see some selling off today, that would mean that the fed statement is still working"
"408100","414960"," and that the market's going to play ball until they have a policy change, which is there."
"415340","420160"," This is their job right now is to scare the market, scare you. "
"421060","423360"," So he's able to get that message across today."
"423380","428780"," You could see just a dip down here and then a continuation in the month of December."
"432300","437100"," So I think I think the key here is if we rip it up and hire, we're probably going to"
"437100","438380"," have a nasty roll over. "
"438840","444900"," If we're able to sell it down in here, you might get some kind of a Santa rally holiday rally"
"444900","446520"," in the month of December."
"448200","453740"," And then a roll over for end of month and then some kind of a bottom in January and then"
"453740","455700"," a deeper bottom more than likely in March."
"456140","457400"," And we'll look at both of those scenarios. "
"458560","463920"," The key today is, you know, does he throw any hammers at us that we don't know."
"464780","469900"," Make sure that you know today what's already expected that there's going to be an easing in rates"
"469900","470240"," somewhat."
"470760","472540"," A pace of rates coming into December. "
"474340","478480"," And how bearish does he actually get his job right now is to get super bearish."
"479120","481280"," So I wouldn't shock me to hear him even threatened."
"482920","487880"," Just the sound bites of we may increase rates in December, something crazy like that this morning. "
"488960","492480"," Now, I want you to see this right here that I'm hoping we get this dip."
"492680","495480"," If we don't get this dip and we start ripping, then it's right back."
"495680","498420"," So this reaction trade is you're buying a dip down here. "
"498420","502300"," If we blast north that you're looking for positioning to roll the market over."
"502820","509140"," There's no need for you to be in a position that could go the wrong way on some unexpected news"
"509140","509580"," today."
"509960","513100"," There might be some day trades in here by a dip traded up. "
"513220","517340"," Usually in these events, you'll see two or three trades set up throughout the morning."
"518059","526700"," And then you'll see a slow, a slow fade or a slow rise as shorts cover their positions."
"527900","529280"," Now, so you'll see that this afternoon. "
"529520","532640"," You'll see that this morning as the day moves forward."
"532820","534400"," Just take a look at this chart right here real quick."
"535620","542400"," We'll talk about the different reactions off the Fed Speaker today and what they imply down the"
"542400","543240"," road for the market. "
"548030","549390"," Get that back up there."
"550010","551190"," Give me a second here."
"551510","552470"," I'll put this down. "
"552630","554490"," I'm back to a one day chart in the one minute."
"569770","572230"," Here's our three above here for a gap bill."
"572930","574350"," There isn't much to look at. "
"575910","579970"," There's not much to look at in terms of setups from yesterday."
"581370","585590"," This pivot point is pretty much this this whole gamma area is right down here."
"587090","588990"," We have a magnet down at 390. "
"589650","591310"," We're going to want to trade down to 390."
"593210","596830"," And then we've got a pin somewhat to 395 right now."
"597130","601830"," If we trade up into this 400 area where this yellow line is, you're going to expect us to sell"
"601830","602150"," off. "
"602850","608790"," And if you break below this pivot line, you're going to expect us to want to trade back up into"
"608790","611430"," that 395 area that pivot point."
"623840","628340"," Yeah, I think it's, I think it's just the, I don't think it's a, I don't think it's, it's just"
"628340","629120"," key words."
"629860","633420"," The heat, what he needs to get across is the market fair. "
"633600","634760"," That's their job right now."
"634840","638840"," They're, they're most important job as we see a policy shift."
"639080","639700"," We're going to see it on. "
"640060","641860"," We're going to see a policy shift."
"642040","642760"," I promise you."
"643120","645260"," And so their job is shifting. "
"647320","650940"," To as much market fear as possible."
"651360","652100"," You're aware of that."
"652180","652900"," Okay, you're going to see. "
"653480","655760"," You're going to see a shift to."
"657180","658620"," This is old school J pow."
"659280","660520"," This isn't the J pow. "
"661400","663280"," I'm telling you, you're going to see a J pow."
"663460","667100"," That's not the J pow that sat in front of the Senate and said."
"667940","672120"," We promise to be honest with the American people, the American people are off doing their own shit"
"672120","672400"," now. "
"672400","674520"," So his audience now is us."
"674940","680820"," So it's back to this old J, this old Fed where they're, they're, they're double speak."
"681080","685180"," There's like one, there's, there's, I don't want to say it's full on lying. "
"685600","687440"," And then of course the surprises come out."
"688220","693140"," But this is, this is old school fed bullshit that they, that they do."
"693380","697400"," And they're right back into that old school bullshit right now in my view, especially with that"
"697400","699680"," last week that that's speaking that they did last week. "
"699680","702000"," This reminds me of old school fed nonsense."
"704080","707940"," And so the question just becomes in my mind is how long can they keep the, keep the lie up"
"707940","711580"," before the actual cash market makes that turn."
"712380","716260"," Because you're seeing it in other markets right now that no one fucking believes the fed. "
"716520","722580"," So, and you're, you're going to eventually see the cash market try to price in quantitative easing"
"722580","729560"," or at least pausing at some point down, down the road so they can price that into our mark to"
"729560","732980"," our stock markets specifically first."
"735100","736700"," So I'll leave this here with you this morning."
"736780","737680"," I'll be back in about an hour. "
"738280","741360"," I'm going to put the news back on for you pay attention to it this morning and a bunch of"
"741360","742400"," stuff coming out."
"743220","744280"," And I'll be right back."
"747000","748280"," And yeah, keep the chat going. "
"748820","750200"," What else they got for you this morning?"
"750240","751180"," I think that's it so far."
"754240","755620"," You can see our range here."
"757920","760160"," Got a target above of 3980. "
"763700","770920"," That is right right up in 390 is somewhere around our one."
"771060","773020"," We're not going too much farther than our one up here."
"787960","791260"," Got another fat target down below that's 39. "
"793380","793940"," 3925."
"796280","800120"," That's 3925 is S2."
"800880","805920"," So there's going to be some kind of an expected move or trading range today. "
"808740","809440"," 3925."
"810180","817760"," So we've got 3913 somewhere right here."
"818020","820080"," Some kind of an expected range in here. "
"821980","823360"," So make that green."
"826680","828480"," And then we'll draw another one above."
"836520","838860"," We'll see how this holds up for intraday stuff. "
"845330","846590"," Make sure I got that right."

"2073440","2077719"," As a matter of fact, I was going to reach out to a few of you and I haven't even"
"2077719","2078820"," gotten that stage yet."
"2079139","2080219"," It's just like a ton of work. "
"2081840","2083760"," Yeah, we'll go over the option prices today."
"2085139","2085500"," Definitely."
"2087820","2089639"," We'll do a couple things you're going to do right now. "
"2089739","2090100"," We're going to do."
"2091120","2093000"," We'll do a poll."
"2093820","2094620"," Start with a poll. "
"2097980","2098860"," And we'll see."
"2101160","2102680"," I want to I have never done a poll."
"2102860","2104060"," So we'll see if we can do a poll. "
"2108780","2109140"," Content."
"2109960","2113760"," I think I can do this."
"2117640","2118740"," Not much stuff to do. "
"2120820","2121980"," Engage with your audience."
"2121980","2122720"," Start a poll."
"2125340","2125940"," Will. "
"2128240","2129060"," Jay Powell."
"2136520","2138000"," Make the mark."
"2138260","2140100"," Make the cash market go up or down today. "
"2143320","2144240"," Big up."
"2148820","2150200"," Or big down today."
"2150540","2151320"," Everybody wants to know, right?"
"2155830","2157090"," Smart money done money. "
"2164860","2165720"," Big down."
"2168020","2169140"," We'll put one more."
"2169420","2169940"," No idea. "
"2172220","2173240"," Sitting on hands."
"2178620","2179500"," There we go."
"2179880","2180880"," Ask your community. "
"2181160","2181840"," We can see if that works."
"2185790","2189110"," So that should come into your you should have a poll in there at some point."
"2197020","2198640"," And then we'll look at the options. "
"2198920","2199780"," Are we a bunch of stuff we'll get."
"2199940","2201380"," I want to talk to you guys about something important."
"2201560","2205020"," Someone was asking me this morning to talk about. "
"2206080","2210520"," There's a there's a there's like the dovish fed the hawkish fed, right?"
"2212200","2216600"," And then there's the when dovish is actually hawkish or bad for bulls."
"2217260","2221780"," And when hawkish is actually good for bulls."
"2222380","2224100"," And vice versa for bears. "
"2224780","2230760"," I think most of you know most about most most understand this concept, but there's some that don't."
"2232220","2236220"," And so we're going to do just a quick we're going to give you your chart."
"2236220","2239340"," We're going to make it very simple like not rocket science. "
"2241020","2242960"," Just just for simplicity sake."
"2245340","2247980"," Let me log into my brokerage real quick here."
"2249900","2251620"," I'm going to check the options market. "
"2252100","2256140"," I have no doubt that the dealers are fucking taxing everybody today."
"2256620","2257700"," No doubt either."
"2257840","2259020"," They're going to make money on both sides. "
"2259200","2259380"," We talk."
"2259520","2260000"," That's another thing."
"2260080","2260760"," We'll talk about that later. "
"2261560","2264180"," We talk about it every time we have one of these bullshit days."
"2265060","2268720"," And what you're going to see is you're going to see re pricing at some point."
"2268720","2270360"," We'll talk about the swings in market. "
"2271780","2272720"," As they happen."
"2273080","2273800"," What's going on here?"
"2273900","2274360"," What am I looking at?"
"2274480","2275360"," Oh, I'm looking at S Dow."
"2276040","2281380"," Oh, should we talk about the, uh, the, uh, super, super, super, super, super, super short to Dow?"
"2281840","2283400"," Well, maybe get to go without later today. "
"2283580","2285940"," I'm looking at, I got a position in there."
"2286140","2287840"," So hold on."
"2291240","2291860"," It's by. "
"2293320","2295240"," Remind me in chat later on."
"2295260","2295740"," Remind me."
"2297680","2299480"," Remind me to talk about the S Dow. "
"2299480","2301540"," Take a symbol, S D O W."
"2301900","2303940"," Look at the January and March strikes."
"2309500","2309980"," Okay."
"2310120","2311780"," Today's option chain here. "
"2312000","2312600"," See what's going on."
"2312680","2314800"," I haven't even, I haven't even paid attention to it this morning yet."
"2315560","2315920"," Number 30. "
"2319300","2322260"," You get a large position building up on the put side."
"2323540","2325800"," Fucking shit, tons of calls stack though too."
"2328660","2331040"," Do you want to let, let's do this real quick. "
"2333660","2337400"," Keep your eyes on that book map, the bottom tag 3925."
"2341450","2342830"," We're going to get out of that real quick."
"2343030","2346150"," We're just going to look at a larger timeframe chart once more. "
"2348190","2353630"," This chart's kind of shitty to look at, but it's, it'll give the visual interpretation that you're"
"2353630","2354190"," looking for."
"2356130","2359650"," I apologize for all my, all my fucking shit in here."
"2360870","2362810"," So the point here is this though. "
"2362910","2363890"," There's, there's a key point here."
"2366330","2369010"," Some of you are like Jerome Powell's going to be fucking."
"2371110","2371510"," Dovish. "
"2372130","2372870"," I'm going to tell you this."
"2372950","2373110"," Okay."
"2373470","2374170"," Right now specifically. "
"2374510","2377470"," On the market here is we are seeing some upside movement in the dollar."
"2377670","2381890"," So overall dollar strength at the moment and our individual headline catalyst for this."
"2382070","2382790"," We're keeping our eyes out. "
"2384170","2385210"," We'll turn this down."
"2385550","2390250"," So Jerome Powell and the Fed basically, right where we are right now."
"2390330","2393350"," If Paul McCurss are right, they need to keep the market down. "
"2394070","2398170"," If we get any kind of a public change of policy."
"2399310","2401610"," That's not 50 BPS in December."
"2401930","2407450"," That's not a terminal rate or whatever a fucking 5 or 7%, 5.75, whatever the fuck it is. "
"2408310","2410250"," What you'll see is you'll see the market."
"2411470","2415390"," I'm saying if you see like a more, more Dovish like all we're going to pause."
"2415630","2418530"," Oh, we're going to lessen the rates. "
"2419070","2420750"," This is usually in the minutes."
"2421410","2422930"," It's even just tonal change."
"2423950","2426530"," What you'll see is the market will start to immediately. "
"2426910","2429290"," The world is using hope and entering a period of malaise."
"2429770","2434430"," I think says that after we get out of the spike in inflation, we'll be in a world of two,"
"2434950","2436050"," three, four percent inflation."
"2437490","2439350"," Yeah, you're already seeing the talk come out. "
"2439350","2440910"," So I'm going to turn that off for a minute."
"2441110","2446150"," So what you'll immediately see is this would have been the bottom and you will see a melt up that's"
"2446150","2446730"," out of control."
"2448270","2453870"," So because of that, I don't think you're going to see until it comes out in a minute or it"
"2453870","2454750"," comes out in a meeting. "
"2454970","2455930"," Normally it's the minutes, right?"
"2456090","2461050"," Wherever the fuck they tell you after the meeting or during the meeting has nothing on what"
"2461050","2462470"," actually comes out in the minutes."
"2464590","2468330"," So normally that would be in the next December, January, February, March."
"2468330","2472690"," You'll find out in the minutes and we're going to immediately start fucking melting up. "
"2473750","2475150"," Do they want to do that right here?"
"2475310","2475850"," Probably not."
"2476230","2480590"," So when you're thinking about today, when you're thinking about December meeting and you're"
"2480590","2484670"," thinking about the minutes from that December meeting and specifically about their public"
"2484670","2492070"," commentary, their job right now is to really hammer on, keep the market status as long as possible"
"2492070","2497150"," until that becomes public knowledge because the ramp happens."
"2497150","2502110"," So there's another problem with this too. "
"2503350","2505290"," Let's say we get that ramp, right?"
"2505390","2506510"," You get that policy change."
"2507070","2512270"," There should be a violent move down within like two weeks to start this ramp up."
"2512830","2517610"," Some kind of a violent move down with that huge ramp up, something like this. "
"2518090","2520170"," Then we had something like this in March, 2022."
"2520970","2523630"," A quick ramp, a slam down and then just rocket ship."
"2523850","2525950"," So this part is the important part to remember. "
"2525950","2527810"," I'm talking to you about, okay?"
"2529170","2530810"," This is the important part right here."
"2530990","2532070"," And the reason for that is this."
"2532270","2539370"," If the Fed stays, at least in their commentary, bearish and they're meeting commentary bearish,"
"2539570","2543570"," you'll get this still controlled trade down here, right?"
"2544630","2548730"," And what I'm trying to say to you here is this is that we already know. "
"2550130","2554030"," We already pretty much know for a fact that they're done."
"2554670","2555710"," They're already done."
"2556130","2562470"," So the implication would be that you would see the bearish commentary today. "
"2562610","2565430"," You'd see bearish commentary under the meeting, right?"
"2565690","2570030"," You'd somewhere over here, you'd roll over or you dip and roll over, right?"
"2571190","2575170"," But then sometime into January and then March."
"2578610","2581070"," If we, if they stay the course, right?"
"2582230","2585770"," I'm going to expect us to move up into 2025, just like that."
"2585990","2586910"," That would be my expectation. "
"2588250","2590490"," This would be the expected move if they stay the course."
"2590770","2591970"," There is no change, right?"
"2592070","2593790"," This would be the clock stays the path."
"2594370","2597590"," We don't get that message in December. "
"2598430","2601030"," From the December minutes or January or March minutes."
"2601590","2602630"," I think we're going to move up."
"2602830","2606210"," And then the 35 are actually the, the movie would be like 3500. "
"2606290","2607210"," They're making that a little bit weird."
"2607930","2608930"," You get it down to like here."
"2608930","2611010"," 35 boom, move up and March. "
"2612250","2618410"," Now, if in this timeframe, this December minutes, whenever the summer minutes come out, January,"
"2618630","2624310"," fucking March minutes come out, you would see like that two week movement where we slammed down to"
"2624310","2627430"," that 3200 and then start that rocket ship up."
"2628330","2633970"," And so the point is that back here when we hit 350, I told you to enter the market, right?"
"2634110","2635750"," It said at least start a position here."
"2636590","2640370"," You want to consider some kind of a position here regardless of where we go. "
"2640610","2647050"," And another consideration of entering the market with some cash left over somewhere between now and"
"2647050","2648850"," March, April, start thinking about this."
"2649390","2656850"," Now, there are black swan events that could get us deeper than 3200 or this move could be deeper"
"2656850","2657590"," than 3200."
"2658110","2662910"," If this, if we hit 3500, let's say hit 3200 January, right?"
"2663410","2665670"," And then it becomes this dip down to 2400. "
"2665810","2672290"," These numbers can change, but I want you to be careful of what, when hawkish is dovish, when dovish"
"2672290","2675070"," is hawkish in terms of the cash market."
"2675910","2679730"," And whenever this, whenever we get this dip is going to be important as well."
"2680410","2681530"," Because you can get that dip here. "
"2681750","2684430"," If they do turn a dovish right now and say, Oh, fuck it."
"2684430","2684670"," We've."
"2685390","2686830"," You caught us red handed. "
"2687090","2688810"," They could do it over here early."
"2688810","2690770"," You can find out in the minutes early in January."
"2691130","2692830"," We get the roll down over here. "
"2693230","2697290"," I know this looks horrible, but account for that one dip."
"2698930","2703390"," On once they do make that dovish statement or that, Hey, we're going to, we're going to ease up on"
"2703390","2709310"," our, our rate plan and we're going to ease up on our not raised 50 basis points."
"2709430","2710850"," We're going to point to five. "
"2710950","2712510"," We're going to pause whatever any of that kind of shit."
"2712510","2716230"," Um, so we, we are looking close to a bottom."
"2716550","2717150"," Where is that?"
"2717370","2718010"," I have no fucking idea. "
"2718210","2719830"," Not, not, not, neither does anybody else."
"2721550","2725770"," Uh, and just looking at these kind of bottoms down here, it's, it would be insane."
"2727230","2729270"," For Jay pod today to just come out and be like, yeah, you know what?"
"2729430","2731290"," We're going to give, we're going to leak all of our stuff to you. "
"2731330","2733010"," That's what they, that's what they promised to do."
"2733570","2738170"," When the Senate was watching the fucking house was watching fucking Jim boner."
"2738170","2745390"," And Billy Bob didn't have a job there sitting at home eating fucking bonbons and fucking candy bars"
"2745390","2745830"," and shit. "
"2745930","2746570"," Everybody was watching."
"2746990","2750610"," And so they're like, the town of the Senate will be full frontal honest with, with America."
"2750730","2752370"," Well, of course, everyone's back to work. "
"2752950","2754910"," So their only audience right now is us."
"2755770","2762490"," So they're back to their fucking lion and I'm going to expect them to lie in attempts to get this"
"2762490","2768550"," down as far as they can until they have to come clean publicly and say, Oh, by the way, we"
"2768550","2769810"," fucking lied since fucking."
"2770570","2775450"," We've been lying since somewhere around here, especially that last look in the 28th. "
"2775890","2778250"," The 28th is when I can see it."
"2778730","2782330"," They were throwing so much shit on the wall to get something to stick."
"2783190","2784110"," It was insane. "
"2785110","2785590"," Who's like this?"
"2785810","2788170"," I haven't heard him this insane at all this year."
"2789090","2792570"," So you can tell that they're in their job mode right there in there."
"2792710","2793710"," I have to do this. "
"2793730","2795230"," This is part of my job right now."
"2795230","2797310"," Make the market believe as long as possible."
"2797470","2800810"," And they could get more hawkish in that stance. "
"2800950","2803650"," There could be this ultra fucking hawk."
"2804430","2809310"," You know, it's kind of like when you talk to your dad, your dad says, I don't want you drinking"
"2809310","2815450"," off without locking your door in your bedroom or I don't want you fighting with your sister or, you"
"2815450","2816890"," know, some fucking nonsense, right?"
"2817630","2820070"," You're not playing baseball if you don't get better grades."
"2820610","2822970"," And then, of course, those threats increased. "
"2824450","2827670"," And if your dad doesn't beat you up, your dad's going to eventually just, you know, increase"
"2827670","2828730"," threats and increase threats."
"2828910","2831650"," And you're as a kid, you're like, well, how far can I test this guy, right?"
"2832470","2836750"," And, of course, in his mind, he's like, what kind of threats do I make this kid to get through"
"2836750","2836950"," to him?"
"2837130","2839130"," I mean, that's not the good way of doing things."
"2839210","2842710"," You want to help the kid and show him the reasons why and all that kind of stuff. "
"2843130","2844010"," This is not the best job."
"2844090","2845330"," The best job is to scare you."
"2846450","2855960"," And they're going to do that as best they can until they leak the beans or until we don't believe"
"2855960","2856500"," them anymore. "
"2857400","2858440"," One or the other, right?"
"2858980","2860380"," It's almost like a Mexican standoff."
"2868950","2872770"," Let's see if we can get this back on a one minute for you guys."
"2881460","2890650"," You guys want to see some nasty, uh, I'm going to assume that there's like, I'm going to assume"
"2890650","2900300"," that there's a bunch of boiler rooms right now trying to, trying to trade today in some form or"
"2900300","2906160"," fashion that their, uh, boiler rooms all across the US and across the world right now are like"
"2906160","2909640"," playing a quick two on two basketball game. "
"2911700","2913920"," I always feel like that's what happens in these days."
"2913920","2918340"," You get, you get a bunch of professional traders that are just like in Gwen here."
"2918460","2919580"," We're going to just do some easy stuff. "
"2919740","2923980"," We're going to create a bear flag down here or a bullfly with right now bull flag and trade it"
"2923980","2926500"," up, slap it off, bring it back down over here, slap it up, bring it down."
"2927040","2934060"," It's like two on two concrete backyard or past shitty basketball court, uh, day trade."
"2940950","2942430"," One 30 in the afternoon. "
"2944610","2946350"," You shouldn't see much movement today."
"2947470","2951650"," You just see quick setups in out that kind of stuff until we get to the meeting."
"2951970","2952590"," That's right there. "
"2952710","2953110"," It's right there."
"2953730","2957090"," We'll put the, uh, put a little yellow on there for you."
"2957950","2960030"," I don't know if you guys can see that or not in your stream. "
"2961210","2962490"," You guys want a little bit fatter."
"2963050","2963550"," There you go."
"2968430","2971050"," And, uh, let me see if we can see if we can. "
"2973470","2974810"," Start drawing some lines."
"2981790","2984610"," See if you can find, uh, find some setups for this morning."
"2985950","2987390"," Some, some inter-day trades. "
"2991690","2994690"," See if the, uh, see if the boiler room boys want to come out and play."
"3001680","3003480"," Start with this one and see how this holds."
"3004740","3006020"," A little weird one over here. "
"3006260","3007680"," You could call it like this, but."
"3010600","3011360"," Yeah, that works."
"3011860","3012540"," Something like that. "
"3017060","3018820"," See if this is the way down for today."
"3018920","3019880"," See that trend all the way down."
"3021320","3023900"," And that grind down into the, into the decision. "
"3024660","3025860"," The Brookings Institute."

"3031680","3034300"," Well, J power make a cash money. "
"3034480","3037580"," Let's see if we can, uh, and let's see what the end of the stream is."
"3039160","3041020"," I don't even know how to end this fucking thing."
"3041760","3042500"," End the poll. "
"3046020","3046820"," Two of the results."
"3047120","3048480"," I don't know whether results are on this thing."
"3049840","3054440"," The results are saying that I will J power make the cash market go big up or big down today. "
"3055120","3055640"," Big down."

"3059200","3060440"," That's the smart money."
"3061000","3063720"," And then big up only 15%."
"3063720","3066020"," That's interesting that that's so lopsided. "
"3069170","3071690"," There's a, there's like these two scream."
"3071930","3073530"," There's like two groups of the markets screaming."
"3073810","3078490"," You see some people saying everyone's bullish and they see another group saying everyone's bearish. "
"3080470","3081650"," That's a fascinating result."
"3084630","3085470"," Didn't really winky."
"3089490","3091370"," You want the levels for today from Rana?"
"3097960","3099180"," Let me get drink some water here. "
"3105710","3109250"," Yeah, it's a, you know, it's not the best parenting, but you know that it happened."
"3109470","3109690"," It happened."
"3110010","3111430"," My dad did to me when I was a kid. "
"3112330","3116930"," You know, my dad would take me, you know, my dad had private conversations with me outside of how"
"3116930","3117870"," he talked in front of my mother."
"3120230","3123610"," And it was the, it was, it was the conversation of."
"3125110","3125870"," You're a man. "
"3126430","3129510"," And because you're a man, no one's ever going to take care of you."
"3129770","3131630"," No one's going to care about your wife or kids."
"3132410","3134990"," No one's going to ask you what you're feeling and how you feel about yourself. "
"3135130","3137250"," So I'm going to teach you."
"3138810","3142090"," How horrible it's going to be in some ways, you know."
"3144590","3146070"," It sucks to say that. "
"3146250","3147850"," That's what it is."
"3147850","3150450"," And I've, I've felt like that as an adult too."
"3151030","3154330"," And I hated him for some of those things when I was a kid that he told me, but then"
"3154330","3156650"," as it became an adult, I figured out he was right. "
"3157450","3158810"," He was trying to protect me."
"3160490","3163170"," Of course it's a hard lesson to learn as a young man, but."
"3167670","3170610"," Be sure that 178, let me see what you guys are talking about in here. "
"3175710","3178570"," You know, you want to be one of the love of your kids and."
"3179510","3183810"," You know, like feelings and thinking and all that sort of stuff and."
"3186050","3190390"," Explaining things to children, letting them figure out a work through problems to find the answer. "
"3190950","3194990"," But, you know, I don't have a son, probably, probably a good thing to have a son, but."
"3196310","3198590"," My dad, at least, you know, took me aside and said."
"3199570","3200430"," These are all the bad. "
"3200550","3201050"," This is all the bad."
"3201150","3201910"," It's going to happen to you."
"3206410","3208230"," See you guys are talking about this in the chat. "
"3210970","3211290"," Yeah."
"3213610","3216930"," Men aren't treating like men don't talk about mental health issues."

"3222750","3224730"," We talk about medical stuff and. "
"3225530","3226010"," It's not."
"3226670","3228490"," That's not a normal conversation amongst men, right?"
"3228650","3230290"," All the private stuff you don't want to discuss."
"3230830","3231530"," You're kind of raised. "
"3231630","3233970"," There's this weird thing where boys are raised."
"3234630","3235090"," Not to."
"3236010","3237130"," You know, show feelings or. "
"3237570","3239170"," Express mental health issues or."

"3253490","3257730"," Break out the medical aid kit or let me listen to your shoes."
"3259290","3260250"," Or what do you need?"
"3260410","3260790"," You need some money?"
"3261010","3261890"," You want me to take you out?"
"3261990","3262950"," You want some daddy and dog time?"
"3263910","3265670"," But, you know, for men, it's just not the case."
"3268230","3270830"," You know, the fight thing to is my wife and my wife and kids are. "
"3271650","3272330"," You know, not."
"3273110","3275190"," Crazy feminist, but they're feminists and we played a."
"3276010","3277090"," It's a real pursuit game."
"3278150","3280090"," And I ended up knowing all the, all the. "
"3281250","3283050"," Women's answer stuff, but they didn't."
"3284250","3287070"," So I was making fun of them in the, in the, in the party we were having."
"3287510","3288750"," This is just a few days ago. "
"3296570","3297470"," That doesn't happen."
"3297770","3298830"," No offense to women out there either."
"3299090","3301570"," It's just this immense thing that they have to deal with is. "
"3302570","3303210"," You have to open up."
"3303330","3304090"," You have to take care of yourself."
"3304830","3309010"," You have to take care of yourself physically, mentally, your brain, all kinds of stuff. "
"3313260","3315280"," You have to have a freshman in college or high schools in the."
"3315460","3315500"," Yeah."
"3321240","3322680"," Yeah, it's tough to live stream and trade. "
"3322860","3323220"," It's not easy."
"3324680","3325140"," It's not."
"3325380","3327500"," It's, it's a trade last one. "
"3327640","3329020"," I live stream."
"3333260","3335220"," The mask we live in is a decent film."
"3335360","3335920"," You know, I haven't. "
"3336140","3336920"," I haven't."
"3337780","3338140"," Watch that."
"3338260","3338860"," I'll have to watch it. "
"3338860","3340380"," I'm going to write it down right now."
"3340520","3341340"," The mask we live in."
"3350540","3351220"," Yeah, we're. "
"3352780","3354000"," It's the same thing, right?"
"3354140","3354300"," You teach."
"3354640","3355520"," Not we don't."
"3355620","3361320"," We don't want to, but you know, we reinforce certain stereotypes on a, on a kids. "
"3361760","3363060"," I'm not trying to get into like the."
"3364600","3365400"," The, the, um."
"3367160","3367720"," The outside. "
"3369940","3373900"," Fringe stuff that's right in our faces on the internet, both sides, right?"
"3374200","3376160"," Public and fucking far right and far fucking left."
"3376400","3377200"," Like the whole thing."
"3377280","3378840"," I'm just talking about just generally speaking. "
"3379940","3383780"," Um, there's, you know, just reinforcements that are built into our society."
"3384120","3385140"," Good, bad, whatever."
"3385420","3385880"," It doesn't matter. "
"3385960","3386520"," It's just what it is."
"3392580","3393020"," No."
"3393740","3393980"," Thanks. "
"3393980","3394060"," Thanks."
"3394440","3395300"," I'm not in the hotel."
"3396740","3402800"," And I wish, uh, you know, I was from the generation where like, um, like peak divorces, right?"
"3403300","3405700"," Peak, like, uh, 80s, 90s. "
"3408200","3413000"," And, uh, a lot of my peers didn't have YouTube."
"3413580","3414820"," Um, so amazed right now."
"3415000","3415900"," You'd like the, the. "
"3415900","3422560"," Uh, YouTube is like a father to people, men and women, girls and boys."
"3424200","3428740"," For all the bad things, YouTube is there's some real positive to YouTube."
"3429480","3433920"," If you ever learned how to cook a meal for yourself or learned how to change oil or. "
"3435060","3436400"," Someone has given you an opportunity to do that stuff."
"3436740","3437500"," You can at least go there."
"3443580","3443880"," Yeah. "
"3444320","3444400"," Yeah."
"3445000","3445540"," Uh, yeah."
"3445900","3447440"," It was very, it was very folksy. "
"3448660","3449460"," That was like a."
"3450400","3454340"," I wasn't sure if I should post that video because it's not really my."
"3455580","3456280"," I don't know."
"3456420","3457020"," My or. "
"3458060","3459240"," I look at things, but."
"3460300","3461380"," It was very folksy."
"3461520","3462040"," I agree. "
"3462140","3466220"," It's kind of corny and stupid, but there was some, there was some, like, inside their stuff."
"3466220","3466820"," That was pretty good."
"3468560","3468960"," Yeah. "
"3469080","3469560"," E and P H."
"3469700","3470560"," They're on everybody's talk."
"3470980","3471500"," Everybody's talking about that."
"3474020","3475000"," Yeah, the Wrangler school. "
"3475000","3478320"," I think he was directing that towards his audience."
"3478980","3480080"," I think that's what it was."
"3480180","3481040"," It was a folksy video. "
"3481160","3482140"," I think it was directed towards."
"3482540","3484840"," I think if you looked at his demographic of people that."
"3485460","3486760"," Watch him all the time. "
"3487760","3489980"," He was trying to get through to a certain demographic."
"3490880","3491660"," And, uh."
"3494830","3496110"," Her implied like tough guy, right?"
"3496870","3501450"," Be kind of like your, if you're a soldier, be kind of like your, your mean sergeant coming to you"
"3501450","3501550"," and. "
"3501790","3503670"," Having a humanistic moment or."
"3504110","3505550"," I don't know your boss or."
"3506830","3511570"," Someone that's that position of authority or you look up to in some masculine way. "
"3513370","3514310"," Hey, we'll look at Tesla."
"3516050","3517090"," We're learning trade well."
"3518670","3519130"," Okay. "
"3519730","3520190"," Okay."
"3520690","3521030"," Life lessons."
"3521870","3523070"," Let's go and see if you guys have a."
"3523410","3526090"," Good morning, Satchel. "
"3526210","3526450"," How are you?"
"3527770","3530050"," You're going to hold the short at 178."
"3531010","3531810"," We'll think about."
"3531810","3534030"," I got a position on. "
"3539130","3540530"," I've got a Dow short."
"3546150","3546910"," That's down."
"3548210","3549530"," That's doing pretty well today. "
"3551070","3553470"," It's not doing that's not doing so bad today is it."
"3555810","3557370"," It's doing pretty good."
"3560710","3562270"," You guys want to see the Dow short. "
"3563190","3564190"," Take a look at a."
"3565210","3565670"," Best Dow."
"3566590","3569170"," And then, um, let's see, I mean this."
"3579470","3580890"," This is a year chart on it. "
"3586100","3586760"," It's right here."
"3586880","3587480"," This is a."
"3588880","3589260"," 929."
"3589700","3591000"," So this is back in September. "
"3591740","3593200"," It got really nasty."
"3593640","3597360"," It went up, I think, 400% back in June or March of 2020."
"3598740","3599520"," I doubt it. "
"3599520","3600600"," I doubt it goes up that high."
"3600760","3601880"," I think it was below on."
"3601920","3602500"," It was 137. "
"3603320","3603940"," Maybe not 400."
"3605860","3608200"," 360% or 330% somewhere in there."
"3608540","3609220"," Got a big spike. "
"3611360","3615280"," I don't think it gets this high, but it could possibly go up 300%."
"3616500","3617540"," Between now and March."
"3617540","3621460"," If we have that moment with the market, if we have that moment with the market, does that double"
"3621460","3624900"," dip because they do shift, you could get a spike like this. "
"3626120","3632860"," There's a lot of interest in January in the money calls, 26, I think, $26 and $24."
"3636040","3638380"," And you can kind of see that's tempting."
"3638720","3641300"," You know, this is not this dangerous, of course, this is an ultra short. "
"3642760","3643120"," Position."
"3643600","3645020"," There's a gap above up here."
"3646480","3647540"," Kind of a sweet spot. "
"3647740","3647780"," Right?"
"3647900","3649300"," There's a gap bill up here at $51."
"3652780","3654580"," If you want, I'll show you a chart for."
"3655560","3656180"," We'll take a look. "
"3656360","3657080"," We can do that right now."
"3657700","3658320"," Give me a second here."
"3661770","3662950"," Give me just a second. "
"3663210","3666370"," Now, this doesn't account, of course, not going to account for any IV."
"3668410","3669370"," Let me see if I can."
"3669370","3673190"," I'm going to find something here. "
"3677970","3679330"," Let me just take it."
"3684510","3686590"," We'll do just a long call."
"3693640","3695320"," We got a spike this morning, but. "
"3698360","3700200"," You can get this thing to load up."
"3701800","3702840"," Select option."
"3703660","3704640"," We'll do March. "
"3705260","3708620"," You did January, March, March, January."
"3709000","3709760"," Right now, that's be 50."
"3713300","3714900"," Saw that gap above that. "
"3718680","3721960"," That gap above that 50, right?"
"3722140","3723180"," So we'll put 50 on here."
"3730410","3731410"," There's no interest."
"3731690","3731970"," No IV. "
"3732730","3733730"," No people coming into the."
"3734690","3735630"," Into the trade."
"3737110","3741670"," But in March, if you got this gap spike up, you're looking at 200%. "
"3742150","3742610"," 300%."
"3743150","3743610"," 400%."
"3744410","3744870"," 500%. "
"3744870","3751150"," And the other cool part is when it does, when it does scream higher, it holds."
"3751530","3754770"," Unlike VIX, where it's like up like 30 seconds, then blast back down."
"3755550","3757530"," And you have to constantly monitor it. "
"3757810","3762030"," I will go back and look at the chart and I'll show you that it actually spikes and holds for"
"3762030","3764390"," multiple days, two, three, four days."
"3766330","3768830"," So you'll be able to capitalize this."
"3768830","3770830"," The high end is like a 500% trade. "
"3771610","3772450"," And it's cheap."
"3773490","3777130"," And I think the January's are the January's like $1.20 or something."
"3777590","3778170"," They're real cheap. "
"3779550","3784270"," I think it's like 320 or something for was or was $3.20 or something yesterday."
"3786330","3788430"," And this has no IV built until either, right?"
"3788570","3789670"," No other people coming into it."
"3791050","3795490"," So if you see that trade, you could use it as just you can tell yourself. "
"3795490","3796110"," Yeah, you know what?"
"3796210","3799090"," I burn money on bad trades all the time."
"3801090","3803570"," You can actually see previous instances."
"3804630","3805950"," So if you look at my cursor here, right?"
"3807710","3811990"," 613, 614, 616 was the peak. "
"3812250","3820130"," You have like at least three, four, five days to monetize that trade and see the gap fill above"
"3820130","3820570"," here."
"3821310","3825370"," The problem with these trades is you could be upside down."
"3826290","3828490"," You can get bloodbath in these trades, right?"
"3829710","3832370"," So it's more of like a trade that you take and you don't look at it. "
"3832450","3833670"," You don't care what the market's doing."
"3833730","3837010"," You don't care what anyone has to say about the market."
"3837210","3838990"," You just kind of like hide the trade. "
"3840510","3845410"," And let's say you buy the trade for $2.50, put a sell price on a limit sell on it"
"3845410","3846770"," like an auto limit sell at."
"3848510","3849950"," Call it 300% right?"
"3852590","3854210"," See, do you like 10 bucks or something?"
"3856490","3858790"," And hope it's fucking hits between now."
"3859050","3862830"," I think a lot of ticket between now and March and March, I think March 17 or something. "
"3866070","3867590"," And it's a pretty sweet trade."
"3872540","3873960"," Yeah, I make bad trade."
"3874220","3875920"," Did I fucking lose dollar trades all the time?"
"3875920","3878940"," I'm like, uh, one through two, three dollars. "
"3879760","3880920"," It's into March."
"3882080","3883980"," If it hits, it's fucking really hits."
"3886980","3888740"," You got a lower low down here too. "
"3890320","3891280"," Keep driving."
"3891460","3892600"," Just be careful of that, right?"
"3892800","3895420"," You could end up seeing this, you know, you can end up seeing this."
"3899900","3904940"," You can end up seeing some spikes and lower and then, bam, just hits. "
"3906460","3907660"," Slams that gap up higher."
"3907820","3910040"," So you have to stay in the trade."
"3910040","3911240"," Be disciplined in the trade. "
"3911800","3912940"," Don't panic in the trade."
"3913500","3913920"," You're like compartment."
"3914400","3915580"," You'll get the compartment. "
"3915940","3919760"," Those are my random bullish and bearish and bearish and bullish on these different time frames."
"3923630","3925530"," Open it open a second, third, fourth brokerage."
"3926130","3926630"," Place the trade. "
"3926910","3927450"," Forget about it."
"3927690","3929510"," Put a limit sell on the price you want for it."
"3930190","3931330"," And just consider it a lot of. "
"3934680","3936000"," What else am I looking at here?"
"3936000","3937100"," Back to the spot."
"3941040","3942280"," Oh, look at that, huh?"
"3942760","3944360"," Almost near perfect tag."
"3945120","3945840"," See that?"
"3946100","3947240"," Almost near perfect tag. "
"3947440","3948280"," You guys are following along."
"3948840","3949320"," Watch this."
"3949580","3950200"," Sold this, right?"
"3952940","3954760"," This is a bam. "
"3955820","3957880"," Almost perfect tag failed at VWAP."
"3958060","3959240"," So we're kind of trading VWAP here."
"3959840","3961480"," Almost near perfect tag down below. "
"3962460","3965200"," You're going to kind of expect that same kind of resistance here, right?"
"3965780","3966960"," We come across VWAP."
"3966960","3971220"," Looks like there's pro traders, pro traders out there, boil rooms out here, fucking around the"
"3971220","3971700"," market today."
"3973080","3974460"," You guys can track them on the spot. "
"3975400","3977240"," You guys follow along and chart yourself."
"3977400","3978100"," You're day trading this."
"3983400","3986140"," Simple, effective ways to trade, day trade the market. "
"4028260","4030680"," Almost clean, perfect strike down below here."
"4031260","4033320"," 39391 to the tick, bounced right off."
"4034600","4039700"," Expecting to trade it up to VWAP here at a 390, was it 390?"
"4042720","4043300"," 39501?"
"4048880","4050020"," See that, right, Tony?"
"4055250","4056210"," I kept it. "
"4058370","4059870"," Let me see if we can bring that up."
"4062610","4064130"," He has a day trading this stuff."
"4068490","4069210"," Good morning. "
"4069650","4070270"," Good morning."
"4070430","4071350"," My hash, how are you?"
"4071550","4072170"," My hash, how are you?"
"4078960","4080160"," Thoughts on MBI?"
"4080640","4081620"," We can look at MBI."
"4081820","4082860"," We'll do that next. "
"4083660","4086100"," Let's have an MBI, PPOs, that kind of stuff."
"4086740","4087400"," We'll do it simply."
"4087900","4088220"," Absolutely. "
"4089500","4090340"," Let's go through it."
"4093880","4098640"," Last night, late night, I was going through and back testing some of my trading."
"4111260","4112100"," Just a second here. "
"4116100","4121479"," We're going to do the market breath indicator, and we'll do the price percent oscillator."
"4122340","4123040"," It's good enough."
"4123819","4124399"," They're going to go crazy. "
"4127600","4131279"," You guys have this chart, if you're day trading this, it's easy for you to draw your own charts."
"4132819","4135620"," Grab some longs in and out on these trades."
"4142660","4144080"," We're going to switch over real quick. "
"4144180","4145899"," I'm going to show you guys a different chart."
"4147640","4148899"," Just a second here."
"4157399","4158120"," All right. "
"4159140","4162540"," Let me see if I'm going to mute my camera here so you can see this in a better time"
"4162540","4165920"," frame or turn my camera off here for a second."
"4168500","4169140"," All right."
"4169859","4173540"," So these MBI charts, this is a market breath indicator. "
"4177240","4178560"," This is the market breath indicator."
"4179040","4181979"," And then down below here, we've got a PPO price percent oscillator."
"4184439","4189479"," The good thing about the price percent oscillator is there'll be divergences here at times. "
"4192620","4194060"," Well, first thing, let's start with the MBI."
"4194160","4195000"," This is the MBI right here."
"4195940","4201700"," This is often when I talk about when I talk to you guys about buying spreads, I prefer call"
"4201700","4202000"," spreads. "
"4202280","4203320"," It doesn't matter if the market's going up."
"4203320","4204600"," It doesn't matter if the market's going down."
"4206000","4207280"," Had a year down trend. "
"4207780","4213260"," Still have moments in the market where you could have bought it with just the MBI, right?"
"4213460","4213900"," Get down here."
"4214060","4215000"," Super oversold conditions."
"4215580","4220100"," You put on a call spread in the money call spread that you can calculate. "
"4220100","4221460"," It will make you 100% profit."
"4222640","4223120"," Boom."
"4224080","4224560"," Right. "
"4227500","4227980"," Boom."
"4228380","4230960"," You're more than likely not going to be in the full trade up here."
"4230960","4234420"," You'll just be in there in that trade for a week, two weeks. "
"4234880","4235800"," You can put anywhere."
"4236460","4240960"," There's been a few crashes in the past where you had to, let's say you came down here, right?"
"4241160","4244520"," You hit bottom right here, which would be like right where my cursor is right here."
"4245940","4247560"," And it was continued down, right?"
"4248040","4249700"," And how long did it take for us to get back?"
"4249860","4250880"," That was March 20th. "
"4251260","4254540"," We didn't actually get back and start printing that until June."
"4255820","4260560"," So there's a few, you know, there's a few moments where you'll see dealers won't, won't print any"
"4260560","4260820"," of that."
"4260820","4261240"," Right?"
"4261480","4262960"," I'm big crashes and stuff. "
"4263420","4265200"," So you have to decide on your own risk."
"4265200","4270800"," I'm going to just, you know, will I win nine trades a year or ten trades a year and then"
"4270800","4272260"," every three years I might lose one."
"4272900","4278560"," So it's like a, it's like a 90 or, yeah, be a 96% win rate or something over three"
"4278560","4278800"," years. "
"4279260","4282960"," So you might lose one of these trades every two, three years or so."
"4283640","4289820"," If you're super scared about the actual timing of that trade, right?"
"4289820","4291440"," You can see it right here."
"4292520","4297460"," If you're super, there's a bunch of stuff that goes along with this trade, but that's what this MBI"
"4297460","4297880"," indicator. "
"4298240","4304280"," Cool part about this, this PPO is it shows if we're bullish or bearish, right?"
"4304560","4313020"," You can actually see the context and divergence as well if we're in a bearish stance right now or"
"4313020","4313280"," not."
"4314300","4317600"," You know that we're in a bearish stance, right?"
"4317600","4319140"," You've got a little bit of rollover going on the market."
"4319400","4331620"," You can see just this channel right here is going to correlate to directly to the somewhat directly"
"4331620","4334160"," to, I think this is a little bit lower. "
"4334280","4336260"," I think this chart is not showing up fully."
"4336660","4341720"," It's more somewhere like in here, somewhere like that."
"4342180","4349520"," But you'll see the market, if the market starts to break out of this upper channel, you're going to"
"4349520","4353700"," see this PPO start to roll, but then break through right here. "
"4354340","4356420"," This is where you start becoming uber bearish, right?"
"4357260","4360040"," So currently, we're not really uber bearish in the market."
"4361040","4366880"," We're looking for that sell down, a dip buy and then continuation for the end of December."
"4368500","4371780"," Now, does this show, and this is the flip side of that trade. "
"4372160","4375300"," Does that mean that you want to take or go all in on a long trade here?"
"4375620","4376160"," Oh, fuck no."
"4377700","4383060"," Another cool part is if you wanted to confirm a dip buy all in and that we're going to break"
"4383060","4383260"," out."
"4383340","4390560"," If you wanted to confirm like, if you wanted to confirm this move higher, you'd be looking for,"
"4390560","4397480"," you'd be looking for this to bounce here, and you'd be looking for the breath to be all the way"
"4397480","4398660"," down the dumpster right here. "
"4399280","4403520"," And when you see these divergences, you could then come out and say that you could then at least"
"4403520","4408340"," pause it to yourself, hey, maybe we are going to break out of this downtrend that we're already in"
"4408340","4408520"," here."
"4409400","4410020"," Does that make sense?"
"4412340","4414880"," If you, if you don't see this, right?"
"4415860","4416440"," Excuse me."
"4417160","4419720"," If you, let me see if I can just erase just a part of it. "
"4419940","4421000"," There's a racist part of it."
"4421100","4421200"," Yeah."
"4422040","4430220"," So if you don't see, if you see us more like that right there, right?"
"4432760","4433680"," Well, I'll get rid of it. "
"4433680","4434600"," I don't know how to get rid of this shit."
"4437800","4443260"," If you see us like start to dip below here and we haven't come full down over here, that's going"
"4443260","4446200"," to imply to you that people are, people are caught, right?"
"4447100","4448120"," They're caught short."
"4448460","4450180"," They haven't sold their position yet, right?"
"4450280","4453440"," We have more down to go, right?"
"4453580","4457800"," And that's going to show, you'll see us start to break through down below here, and you'll see us"
"4457800","4459240"," start to break down totally here. "
"4459260","4463460"," So when you see these divergences, it'll give you an idea of where we are."
"4463540","4470000"," Now, once we get down here, it could be here or it could be down here, and you'll then have"
"4470000","4473400"," the freedom or at least the foresight to say, we're oversold."
"4473740","4477540"," We're going to buy a call spread here for the next, for the next oversold buy. "
"4479400","4481020"," Does it make any sense to you guys?"
"4481800","4486220"," There's some other indicators too that you can use, but right now you are, and this is another"
"4486220","4487280"," thing to be careful of."
"4487780","4491080"," I don't know if you can see it on this chart if I can make this bigger, but there is"
"4491080","4494360"," this this purple line is crossing over the green."
"4496340","4498380"," So you are seeing weakness in the market. "
"4498380","4502560"," So in the short term, we're bearish on a short term bias, right?"
"4502980","4506800"," And then in the long term, we're going to wait and see until we come and see what this interaction"
"4506800","4508500"," is down below."
"4509440","4512940"," Very simple, nothing hard that you have to learn."
"4513340","4517500"," You can see that this works whether the market's going up, whether the market's going down. "
"4518100","4523220"," You can back test this going back decades, and this is really dumb trading."
"4524140","4525820"," You guys like to overcomplicate shit."
"4526860","4528420"," You can see back here, right?"
"4528560","4529980"," The market was bullish, right?"
"4530260","4531860"," The green was all high and above. "
"4532880","4536000"," So you can even just see back here, you've got bear screaming, right?"
"4536220","4536820"," We're going to roll it over."
"4536880","4538020"," We're going to roll it over."
"4538640","4539840"," And yet we never did. "
"4540100","4545600"," There was no indication at all in this run up from November 2020, actually before this in March,"
"4545620","4548080"," but there's no indications of that one part November."
"4548300","4551180"," This is where I lost a lot of money right down in here."
"4553020","4555920"," This October, this September, I lost money in here. "
"4556040","4557100"," We broke through down here."
"4558000","4559900"," I fucking got super bearish."
"4560220","4561380"," And I was like, we're going down. "
"4562960","4565240"," I was like, we're down below this PPO."
"4565820","4567040"," We had real risk here."
"4568320","4570900"," Or in my view that we were going to crash the market right back here. "
"4571220","4572500"," I lost a ton of money in here, actually."
"4573280","4573700"," I got fucked."
"4577620","4578900"," We turned that off. "
"4581640","4584280"," I got super, super fucked in that trade."
"4584840","4594220"," I don't know if any of you remember that time period or not, but I got, I got fucked in"
"4594220","4594640"," that trade."
"4596140","4599740"," It was like the first time we broke the price percent oscillator broken down below. "
"4599980","4600840"," And I was like, oh shit."
"4601480","4603220"," I was like, we've been green for way too long."
"4603500","4604100"," Way too bullish. "
"4605300","4606760"," Long, long stretch of bullishness."
"4608740","4610400"," It was like time to turn bear."
"4613440","4620220"," And I went like full fucking tits in, not full, but you know, large, large position that we're"
"4620220","4622080"," going to, we're going to crash the market. "
"4622340","4623140"," We fucking didn't."
"4633680","4635880"," Well, it's like today's not a good example, right?"
"4636120","4637280"," We're not really at that place."
"4637280","4641280"," When we get to that place, if you follow those, if you follow something similar to that, or this"
"4641280","4645020"," multiple, you can do, people do all kinds of different ranges on PPOs. "
"4645060","4646740"," You can do two, three different PPOs."
"4649260","4651920"," But basically you throw RSI's all kinds of nonsense."
"4652300","4653340"," This is fucking all kinds of shit. "
"4653440","4660380"," But whatever, whatever you use, the key would be that when it hits those bottom, bottom levels, you"
"4660380","4662700"," do want to check the market and be like, hey, there's slightly more to go."
"4663100","4666260"," We're going to have like a week of consolidation here where they're just fucking with the pricing."
"4666980","4667740"," On options. "
"4669060","4670960"," It usually takes at least a week or so."
"4671500","4672860"," It usually stays oversold."
"4674180","4676860"," It's not like oversold to 30 seconds, then we start ripping. "
"4677260","4677920"," It's usually like a week."
"4678900","4682760"," In that time frame, you can start setting up models."
"4683900","4685240"," You can do it on Thinkorswim. "
"4687020","4689140"," And you can change the pricing range."
"4689320","4691820"," You can do it on options, a profit calculator."
"4692260","4696240"," You can do it on options. "
"4696980","4701460"," Options.ai. You can just, they have a really fast and dirty way to check that's simple to"
"4701460","4701920"," understand."
"4702460","4706960"," You don't want to get complicated in charting and graphing profit loss or how much you need to make"
"4706960","4707360"," so much."
"4709120","4713040"," Options profit calculator does it in a numerical instead of a graph kind of a way. "
"4713120","4714820"," I think they do graphs, but I think it's mostly numerical."
"4716020","4720360"," But when you get down there, you can be like, ah, in the fucked up part of that trade is."
"4722660","4723700"," Or the. "
"4724340","4724960"," So you."
"4725860","4728160"," So if we bounce down below, right?"
"4728260","4730940"," If we bounced on an oversold condition, it's usually like one to three days."
"4731200","4734420"," If we start to roll over the bare side of this trade is more difficult. "
"4734600","4738100"," If we're starting to roll over process, that shit can sometimes take weeks."
"4740660","4742240"," Even in a downtrend market."
"4742560","4742880"," So. "
"4745060","4749860"," I always recommend finding it some kind of a software or a platform or brokerage."
"4749860","4752580"," Where when we're when you're down in those oversold conditions."
"4753800","4755940"," You can find a way to make just 100% profit. "
"4755940","4756780"," Don't get too greedy."
"4756820","4761600"," You're not looking to go from fucking the absolute bottoms when we roll it over the anticipated"
"4761600","4762440"," roll over."
"4762600","4766360"," You just take enough of that trade to get that 100% for yourself. "
"4766720","4767840"," It's a consistent trade."
"4768120","4770420"," Generally speaking, it's a very low risk trade."
"4770680","4775080"," It's something that keeps you having money to piss away on bad trades. "
"4775600","4778160"," High risk trades, high maintenance trades, that kind of stuff."
"4778160","4784000"," If you're young and you want to manage it and I've seen it fail when you're managing it."
"4784020","4787500"," When you're like, yeah, I'm going to pull this leg off and just get max gains on it as you"
"4787500","4787900"," repire. "
"4790340","4795420"," So there's this pros and cons about how you manage that trade."
"4796140","4798520"," I like it because I like it because I don't have to deal with it."
"4798980","4799660"," Go down on my bunker. "
"4800640","4801060"," Pays the bills."
"4802900","4803620"," It's consistent."
"4806560","4810240"," That's part of what I wanted to do that challenge or how to grow an account challenge, but it's"
"4810240","4810380"," illegal. "
"4810660","4814500"," I can't actually say buy this right here to you guys."
"4814740","4818140"," So if I tell you you have to buy this to be in this challenge, it's illegal."
"4818380","4819420"," I can't give you financial advice. "
"4820460","4827840"," I can tell you what I do to make money and it's a very simple trade."
"4827840","4831200"," And if you have it, let's say we rip up higher."
"4831400","4835280"," That's the hardest part of that trade is not paying attention to social media. "
"4835440","4836300"," Not listening to the news."
"4837060","4839960"," If let's say we go up like 100 points in one day, not 100 points."
"4840080","4841280"," Let's say we got 50 points in one day. "
"4841300","4846060"," It's huge rip and we roll back over 75 points, but then you know, then you have to deal with"
"4846060","4848440"," the fair and you got all this money in line."
"4848800","4854600"," But then it ends up ripping higher anyways, 150, 200, 300 points in that time frame and you're so"
"4854600","4855380"," far above."
"4856040","4861020"," That price is so far above and out of the range of your spread that you're going to nail that"
"4861020","4862200"," max profit on it anyways. "
"4863860","4870860"," Regardless if you pull the fucking leg off or then you can go right ahead and then day trade zero"
"4870860","4871360"," dates long."
"4871540","4876280"," All that shit make a bunch of money, but that's like that one sacred trade that you don't fuck"
"4876280","4876520"," with."
"4876840","4880160"," And if you guys don't have one of those trades in your life, you need to find one. "
"4880160","4884260"," It doesn't have to be that trade, but find a trade that's consistently makes you consistent."
"4886280","4889460"," Banger profit 100% 200% whatever it is."
"4890720","4891860"," Has a high win rate. "
"4893200","4894360"," It's a dumb, dumb, dumb trade."
"4895180","4897020"," It's like the stupidest easiest."
"4899020","4899640"," Stupidest easy. "
"4899880","4904660"," It's it's as perfect as buying the S&P 500 and then selling calls and puts against it."
"4905200","4907440"," It's like simple regular money."
"4912840","4913400"," Oh, yeah. "
"4913540","4915220"," I can do it as a public self challenge."
"4915440","4915820"," We could do that."
"4919860","4921520"," I expect a visit saying is long here. "
"4921620","4924500"," It's a big up trend hit from lows."
"4924860","4925560"," I wasn't paying attention."
"4926480","4931450"," Let me take a look at the volume. "
"4932290","4934370"," I've got more sellers than buyers right now."
"4945400","4946920"," We have to get through 3960."
"4948060","4951820"," Keep that in mind there. "
"4957280","4958440"," That's somewhere somewhere in here."
"4958640","4962040"," There's some, there's some volatility in here where my cursor is."
"4964240","4965720"," I can put a little box in there. "
"4969080","4970760"," The head's up to some volatility in here."
"4976040","4976920"," Take tight."
"4977940","4979140"," Be aware of this volatility. "
"4998690","5000670"," Same pivot point area right in here."
"5020600","5023040"," What is that script you're using for PPO?"
"5023540","5024740"," Let me look at it right now for you."
"5026780","5028420"," It's a very simple PPO indicator. "
"5028780","5029460"," There are more."
"5029640","5032060"," You can make multiple copies of it and change."
"5033100","5039680"," You can do it based on weekly moving averages, monthly moving, like 21 moving average, a seven day,"
"5039760","5044620"," 10 day, like a seven day, 10 day, then like a 20 day, 19, 21 day, and then you can"
"5044620","5049220"," do like a, you can do, you know, longer and longer farther out time periods. "
"5049220","5050520"," 50 day moving average, 150."
"5051820","5052980"," Do a 200 day."
"5053600","5054760"," You can even do a year out. "
"5055300","5058140"," Weekly moving averages monthly, like a weekly monthly PPO."
"5059160","5062900"," And so you can even look on timeframes and say, uh, we're, you know, they're buying them."
"5062980","5070160"," Then you can add in advanced to clienters, um, up down volume on longer timeframes and compare all"
"5070160","5070380"," those. "
"5070380","5073320"," They can get very, you can make this as complicated as you want."
"5074000","5075240"," Um, just a simple one."
"5075800","5079860"," Um, do you want to keep it dumb, which I like?"
"5080080","5080720"," I have my dumb trader. "
"5080980","5081980"," I like being a dumb trader."
"5083300","5089020"," I'll call out like specific ticks and stuff, but as a, as my trading, my trading."
"5089280","5093980"," Um, I've, I've attempted to dumb it down over the years. "
"5094660","5095960"," I used to try to sound smart."
"5096120","5097180"," I don't try to sound smart anymore."
"5097180","5097700"," There's no point. "
"5097700","5100140"," I lost more money trying to do that."
"5100220","5100640"," Stupid shit."
"5101740","5105820"," It's a price percent oscillator from C two trends. "
"5106740","5110640"," So Charlie letter C is an act as a acronym."
"5110940","5111580"," C two."
"5111960","5114300"," And then the word trends T-R-E-N-D-S. "
"5116360","5119900"," And the other one is a market breath indicator by Iceman ran."
"5122320","5123740"," Too fairly easy indicators."
"5124140","5124420"," They're free. "
"5125060","5126340"," They're not paying anything for them."
"5136550","5138350"," Yeah, this falls pushing down now too."
"5138490","5138830"," You see it. "
"5139790","5143590"," So at least on book map, it's pushing down to get a squeeze out of it."
"5149540","5149940"," 3960."
"5150460","5151620"," It's actually higher. "
"5152200","5152420"," It's weak."
"5152620","5153620"," I mean, it's weak resistance."
"5153940","5155700"," The volatility is not that strong. "
"5156840","5158660"," The sellers are getting grinded here for sure."
"5159400","5160300"," Could be a squeeze coming up."
"5162320","5163520"," See what happens here. "
"5166740","5168620"," Little intraday support right down here."
"5170620","5172120"," Should see a break at some point."
"5172360","5173820"," There's some kind of support right here. "
"5182660","5183400"," It's tightening."
"5183640","5184960"," We're coiling."
"5193700","5198700"," If you look on the book map chart, if you look in the order book on the right-hand side,"
"5198720","5202880"," you can see the strength or weakness of sellers. "
"5203620","5206960"," Standing orders on sell orders will increase and decrease."
"5207820","5212380"," And then you're looking at the bottom right-hand side of that book map chart for the full book."
"5213300","5220740"," If you start to see the price of Spy go up for ES or SPX and it's on more sellers"
"5220740","5221240"," and buyers. "
"5221560","5223240"," It's typically a short squeeze."
"5224620","5226220"," Not volume buying."
"5227020","5231500"," If you're looking for a move higher in the market, you're looking for the initial volume spike. "
"5232080","5234200"," And then declining volume for the actual move."
"5235940","5237080"," You usually see a couple of taps."
"5237320","5238300"," One, two, three, we're going up. "
"5239300","5240980"," Then you're looking for gamma in the market."
"5241260","5242920"," That's where that pivot point is, some gamma up there."
"5244480","5245240"," Some zero gamma. "
"5246340","5247000"," A shelf."
"5248040","5249320"," Call whatever you want depending on what you do."
"5250800","5256400"," The carriage of poison is if you're LA wave theory or if you're gamma bro or if you're a market"
"5256400","5258600"," profile bro or whatever the fucking is you are. "
"5266000","5267020"," Yeah, keep it simple, man."
"5267840","5270020"," Will you guys want to take a walk around the market and see what's going on?"
"5271060","5272020"," We can do that next."
"5273080","5273960"," Let's see what's up in the market. "
"5277240","5277960"," Take a look around."
"5282300","5283840"," So let's stroll through the market here."
"5284180","5284940"," We'll see you look at NDX. "
"5285160","5285360"," Let's start."
"5285800","5286940"," Everybody's harping on NDX."
"5289880","5291180"," Let's turn on the index for a quick. "
"5291240","5292120"," I haven't charted out in a while."
"5292340","5292660"," Whoopsie."
"5303170","5306250"," You can see down here in NDX, you've got demand, right?"
"5307710","5309250"," Some demand down here, right?"
"5311310","5312470"," Right down here, right?"
"5312630","5313910"," Try to get through, right?"
"5314110","5314150"," Supply. "
"5314450","5316870"," Try to come in and push through and break through to go lower."
"5317490","5317710"," Unsuccessful."
"5319150","5319870"," Demand came right in. "
"5320190","5321430"," Slammed it right back up."
"5321950","5324950"," Now in consolidation, right?"
"5325530","5328970"," If you see more of this consolidation down here, you know what happens, right?"
"5330170","5333230"," Demand comes right back in, slams it right back up again."
"5334550","5336370"," So if you're a bear, what do you want to see?"
"5337030","5341690"," You want to see a break of this demand right here, right?"
"5341810","5343770"," See this line below down here that I've got here?"
"5345930","5351710"," See, you want to see a break of this demand, rejection, and then the next leg down. "
"5352890","5353950"," I'll clean this up for you."
"5366290","5368410"," Big beautiful gap to fill up here, right?"
"5369030","5369490"," Gorgeous gap."
"5369790","5379070"," So if this holds, if we have that Christmas holiday, Hanukkah, Kwanza rally, you know what you're"
"5379070","5379770"," looking for, right?"
"5379930","5380770"," You know what your target is. "
"5381370","5382790"," You know what you want to buy here."
"5382790","5384390"," You want to buy this dip, right?"
"5385250","5388290"," So if you're a bull on NASDAQ, you're looking to buy somewhere in here."
"5389490","5393010"," You're looking for this to hold and then a rip higher. "
"5394450","5400990"," This would give you the VIX relief that bulls are looking for for the next leg higher."
"5401430","5407190"," This would give you the failure in the larger, the brief failure in the larger upper trend, right?"
"5407190","5408290"," We'd fail briefly."
"5408830","5410730"," Break that channel going up in the spot. "
"5411470","5413150"," We'd slam down here, VIX to go crazy."
"5413890","5415110"," Some kind of fucking stupid volatility."
"5415990","5418190"," Goes high up just high enough, right?"
"5419410","5420450"," And then we slam back higher. "
"5420770","5421910"," If you're a bearish here, right?"
"5422130","5422950"," I don't mind."
"5423130","5424550"," This is a good bear trade down here."
"5425310","5428590"," You're going to wait to see that we break through if you want to get bearish here. "
"5431630","5436050"," You know, you want to see that you want to see this is the good trade right here, but then"
"5436050","5438870"," you want to see rejection and then we start moving lower."
"5439190","5441030"," And there's another key level down here too."
"5441530","5445610"," So this would be the next trade for the bears and then the next trade would be right under 10 "
"5445610","5446010",",000. "
"5446530","5450190"," So you're looking, there's like one trade, two trades, three trades, right, for the bears."
"5451870","5455030"," The break of 10,000, that's where blood and death comes in."
"5455130","5459190"," That's where you start seeing like blood red shit, nastiness, blood red. "
"5460390","5462110"," You start breaking 10,000."
"5463330","5466810"," You're going to see some fucking portfolio manager margin calls."
"5467770","5471530"," You're going to see, you'll see like 136 for on Tesla here. "
"5472010","5475130"," You'll start seeing 90s and lower on Tesla down there."
"5475890","5476770"," Start heading down there."
"5477730","5478410"," Hold on here. "
"5483000","5485780"," Now you could call this a book, but there's a couple different names."
"5486680","5489380"," People call these different things, but it's kind of bullish here."
"5490400","5491960"," Call this consolidation, even if you did. "
"5492520","5495880"," Usually in these wedges, you like to see some kind of a rip down and then the move higher."
"5497000","5498160"," This would be the play for me."
"5498320","5499560"," This is the safe play as a bull. "
"5503350","5504490"," Double bottom, right?"
"5504770","5508010"," I keep hearing every saying, oh, I already tripled our double top on NDX."
"5508150","5514570"," I'm like, this is a fucking double bottom on a trend that's going up to me."
"5514850","5515550"," So I don't know. "
"5515970","5517970"," You have to have some, you have to trade the levels on NDX."
"5519570","5526470"," Let's look at, let's look at junk bonds."
"5527970","5529550"," Chunk bonds look weak, right?"
"5538900","5539540"," Buyers. "
"5540800","5542040"," Let's push this back."
"5543040","5543180"," Demand."
"5548360","5549700"," Demand here, right?"
"5550940","5551620"," Demand here. "
"5552580","5555720"," Demand here."
"5557550","5558650"," You're going to expect something."
"5558810","5560270"," We had some demand kick in here, right?"
"5560870","5561910"," Some liquidity grab here. "
"5562410","5563070"," Through it over."
"5564350","5566350"," Looking for some more demand over here."
"5568030","5571870"," So bearish, kind of bearish right now, but how do you get bearish in the market?"
"5572070","5572990"," You want to see a break below?"
"5574170","5575870"," That's how you get bearish in the market there. "
"5576330","5577150"," Trying to still up."
"5579390","5581070"," So short term bearishness."
"5581570","5586030"," Need confirmation for further bearishness on the market on J&K. "
"5590820","5592380"," You know, bearishness right now."
"5592860","5594520"," Still following trend on HYG."
"5595040","5596200"," Same kind of a story, right?"
"5598060","5599500"," Known demand back here. "
"5599980","5601940"," Got another buy down here."
"5602060","5607200"," If so, if we turn super bearish, you're going to be looking for buyers down below here too, right?"
"5610430","5613950"," We're going to be looking for buyers down below here to step in if we get super bearish."
"5614090","5617690"," This would be like the, this would be the 10,000 level down here more than likely, I think. "
"5617690","5623430"," If these buyers disappear, you'll start to see bloodbath in HYG."
"5627180","5629000"," We start, we start coming up here."
"5629860","5630840"," You know what's on, right?"
"5632860","5634600"," Start attempting to close this gap. "
"5634760","5637120"," This would be the bull case that we're going to come back up here."
"5638100","5639100"," Rip it on higher."
"5639980","5641100"," Close the gap above over here. "
"5645900","5647060"," Something like this maybe."
"5648280","5649920"," That'd be nice right there."
"5650460","5654890"," I like that. "
"5655690","5657210"," I like that trade right there."
"5664980","5671390"," 15 minute bearishness into the, into the event, right?"
"5672010","5672830"," Looks bearish to me."
"5674270","5675390"," On a smaller time frame. "
"5677130","5678630"," You can even look right here, right?"
"5680230","5684630"," Buy it, sell it, buy it, sell it, buy it, sell it, buy it."
"5684630","5686570"," I'd like to see this move down in here."
"5691950","5693750"," Vix came down to a buy zone, right?"
"5694470","5695630"," Found some support, legged up. "
"5697090","5698390"," Boom, right?"
"5698670","5701030"," Found some support now, consolidating, consolidating."
"5701970","5704030"," Waiting for a decision to send itself down."
"5704950","5706770"," To be honest, I really want to see it move higher. "
"5706990","5709490"," I'd really like to see us get up here to this, back to this trend."
"5709490","5712770"," And then roll over for a little bit of a holiday rally."
"5712930","5713550"," It'd be nice. "
"5714950","5717350"," Even if it found support here and then came back up."
"5717910","5720370"," It's going to be January and then you get to bearishness in the January."
"5723270","5725210"," Then you're March, then you, there's your March 45. "
"5726270","5727190"," Somewhere up there, right?"
"5727390","5733450"," You get your, you get your like, your sell off and doom and gloom for a little while."
"5735610","5735970"," Right?"
"5736130","5736750"," Comes back down."
"5737130","5739650"," Maybe starts to find some more support from this support back here. "
"5740850","5741910"," January, boom."
"5743050","5743570"," Then March."
"5744730","5746810"," I guess this is the time frame is wrong here. "
"5747650","5749750"," It's something like this, then down, then bam."
"5750430","5752850"," You need to get your March rip higher to 45."
"5752990","5753590"," Everybody's happy. "
"5758040","5758460"," Dixie."

"6392790","6395990"," Yeah, I'm not interested in, I'm not trading anything right now. "

"6402030","6406930"," And I didn't get caught in it, but some people here got caught in the IV crush."
"6410640","6414320"," Some guys got caught in the IV crush and there'll be two trades. "
"6414580","6416500"," There'll be an initial move trade."
"6417460","6419100"," As a matter of fact, last week we did."
"6420060","6421340"," Last week what happened was. "
"6421340","6426200"," The day just shows the Russia pump 10 spot 9 million barrels for therefore from November the 1st"
"6426200","6427600"," and November the 29th."
"6427860","6431660"," I'm rushing all output at the highest since March before the EU import ban."
"6434620","6439900"," Trade last week was, I believe in the 28th was we came up. "
"6441520","6445320"," Consolidated and traded slowly sideways and then as we approached, we just started blasting."
"6445800","6448180"," You already know that a half an hour before shorts are going to close."
"6448720","6450860"," Talk about that last the 28th as well, right?"
"6451040","6453020"," Even if we go down, even if we blast down over here. "
"6454060","6457040"," You'll still see like a half an hour before like one o'clock hour."
"6457880","6459440"," We can, we can actually show that."
"6460000","6463120"," You should see, we talked about this last one on the 28th. "
"6463120","6464700"," We did the same, the same setup."
"6466480","6468060"," So it's like one o'clock here."
"6469400","6469800"," Right. "
"6473340","6477900"," You typically you'll see the short pressure leading into like with the one o'clock hour."
"6478620","6483680"," And then you'll see at some point shorts closing shorts about a half an hour before."
"6484320","6486680"," Just as a just as a marking point. "
"6487800","6489260"," And then you'll see us back to."
"6492560","6495700"," Flat on the day and then we'll get the decision if we're up or down."
"6495700","6500600"," And I try to put places of interest for the initial spike up or down. "
"6500980","6505120"," So if you were going to say, let's say, let's say Jay Pock comes out, starts talking."
"6505900","6509220"," And he might start off bullish and then turn bearish."
"6510200","6513540"," Or I don't know how he's going to talk, but you know, these speakers when they come out, they"
"6513540","6513780"," usually. "
"6514900","6517260"," Start one way or another and you want to have like an initial price target."
"6517620","6522840"," So let's say you're like, I'm buying calls here cap right at the decision at one at one 30 today."
"6524040","6526980"," You want to be able to take the initial move up. "
"6527240","6529380"," If that's your conviction and take profit."
"6531460","6537360"," Because you'll end up getting a roll over a re pricing once the once the dealer's re price and the."
"6537680","6540680"," The implied volatility comes off of both sides of that trade. "
"6541820","6544100"," Same thing would same thing would be for."
"6545460","6548100"," Same thing would be for the downside."
"6548100","6551560"," So let's say, let's just say, okay. "
"6552420","6553660"," I don't know if this is how it's going to go."
"6554040","6555560"," This is my, this is what I think is going to happen."
"6555820","6561560"," Usually what happens will be bearish or at least consolidating down into the. "
"6563620","6566680"," Unless something's leaked or transcript is leaked."
"6566680","6569780"," You'll end up seeing a short close at some point."
"6570500","6574840"," Bring it right back to flat on the day or right there. "
"6575700","6580040"," You'll want to either be waiting for the news or the interview today might be more challenging"
"6580040","6581380"," because J about tends to."
"6582220","6586440"," Usually starts out bullish and then he gets interviewed and it gets fucked up."
"6587220","6589020"," And something clicks in his head and he gets. "
"6589440","6590440"," Super hawkish."
"6591000","6592980"," Anyways, if you're bullish on today, right?"
"6594240","6597560"," At some point in here, right, we already had the grind down here."
"6598020","6599420"," Already starting to consolidate. "
"6599420","6600640"," Maybe it's happening earlier."
"6600860","6603340"," Maybe did somebody knows what's going to be said."
"6604460","6605600"," Maybe it's already leaking. "
"6605800","6606120"," I don't know."
"6607660","6610440"," But if you get, if you get this initial spike up."
"6611400","6614380"," Just be conscious that let's say you're buying like $5 calls. "
"6615800","6617220"," There's going to be a point above."
"6618380","6619400"," Where's going to be reversal."
"6620180","6624720"," And all those calls are going to turn into like dollar calls, even if you go back up here again. "
"6625260","6625880"," Does that make sense?"
"6627200","6628680"," You'll get a repricing event."
"6629380","6631140"," The event ball will roll off."
"6631400","6633040"," And so you don't want to be caught in those calls. "
"6634240","6636260"," So have price targets above."
"6636500","6637400"," Have price targets below."
"6639920","6641400"," Now for where you're going to take profit. "
"6641760","6644840"," Some of you would want to some of you probably want to see the gap closed and say fuck you,"
"6644940","6645380"," I'm diamond handed."
"6645580","6646440"," I'm in one month calls."
"6647160","6649680"," I want to see this gap close above here. "
"6650940","6656340"," I showed you guys earlier in the stream below the 38% targets down below here, right?"
"6656340","6658520"," 387, 42, 385, 87."
"6659020","6660840"," And then the big boy down below here."
"6661680","6664800"," If you're super bearish, you're like, Jay positive to get super bearish. "
"6664820","6665780"," We start plunging."
"6666040","6668400"," You want to take that money from those puts."
"6669300","6673500"," So you don't want to see something like we blast down here and we just miss. "
"6674420","6675160"," 382, right?"
"6675760","6678760"," It's usually it's like right before monetizing that."
"6679300","6681860"," That target you're like, Oh, I'm taking three seventy threes."
"6682020","6682720"," Don't do that. "
"6684340","6687520"," They usually won't we usually won't plunge in the initial plunge that deep."
"6687640","6689160"," It'll be like it'll be just below it."
"6689940","6692660"," So you hit will hit like you buy something more in the money. "
"6693620","6695300"," For the move down if you're a bear, right?"
"6695580","6696620"," If you're bearish on this."
"6697420","6701760"," You do something more in the money and you pick a place pre pick a place."
"6701940","6706020"," They're going to monetize so that you're ready with your finger in the button to sell and get that"
"6706020","6706300"," money. "
"6706840","6708180"," You need to get it out of the hands."
"6708180","6710220"," The fucking dealers don't care about you."
"6710260","6714320"," They give flying shit about you on the upper down move today. "
"6715380","6716460"," They don't care about you."
"6716520","6717720"," They're here to take all your money."
"6718560","6720540"," So if you go up, they want to take your money. "
"6721080","6723180"," If we go down, they want to take your money."
"6723300","6723940"," I guarantee it."
"6725300","6725680"," Guarantee. "
"6725760","6727580"," They're going to want to take your money on this trade."
"6728240","6732540"," They could give two shits about where you think it's going up or down."
"6733700","6735580"," So you have to be super fast in the draw. "
"6735580","6738180"," You have to be like, I took the money and ran."
"6738380","6741540"," You can't be like, we're really fucking dumbish."
"6741580","6742720"," It's going to just keep going. "
"6742880","6743460"," Sometimes it does."
"6743900","6746420"," But even when it does, it'll sometimes pull back down and then go."
"6747060","6748140"," And it's in here. "
"6749120","6751400"," This arbitrage in here that the dealers do."
"6752040","6753580"," Where they snatch their money."
"6753860","6754840"," They snatch the bull's money. "
"6754980","6755680"," It's not the bear's money."
"6756520","6757260"," Take all the bear."
"6757340","6758620"," If it goes up, take all the bear's money. "
"6758780","6759660"," But then they go to the bull's tune."
"6759720","6760340"," They're like, fuck you."
"6761560","6762720"," And then they reprice. "
"6763980","6766580"," So, you know, there's not a."
"6767060","6768200"," So here's the other thing."
"6768280","6769780"," If you're like, if you're just on the sidelines today."
"6770740","6771140"," Colonial. "
"6773120","6775120"," If you're just on the sidelines today, right?"
"6777400","6779280"," You can trade the other side of this move."
"6779520","6781900"," So let's say the initial move is up."
"6783080","6784280"," Let's say we grind. "
"6784520","6785400"," We grind down, right?"
"6785600","6787760"," Come right back to center and then we just blast north, right?"
"6790180","6794240"," And they keep staying bullish or they start bullish and they turn bearish."
"6794580","6797480"," You can look for that short bloodbath down, right?"
"6797720","6798620"," Take this side of the trade."
"6800600","6802660"," You can also, if it stays bullish, right?"
"6802880","6805460"," You can still look for the rollover and then enter along here. "
"6806280","6806420"," Right?"
"6806620","6807840"," So some options here for you."
"6807840","6810960"," And the truth is the truth of the matter is I'm going to tell you the truth of the matter."
"6811060","6812200"," This is the fucking truth of the matter. "
"6812520","6815220"," Not always, but a good percentage of the time."
"6815860","6819500"," Whatever crazy ass move we make, we tend to retrace it."
"6820500","6823980"," We tend to retrace by two or three days later. "
"6824960","6826960"," You also have OPEX on the month."
"6828500","6832540"," You've got these banks that want a stable price for their spreads to print."
"6833580","6834820"," Into an OPEX. "
"6835680","6837300"," So whatever crazy shit you're going to see."
"6838620","6841040"," In a matter of fact, you can actually see it leading up today."
"6841040","6845820"," Let me positively mute the book map real quick. "
"6846480","6849280"," We can just look on like a five-day chart, right?"
"6850400","6853320"," I mean, look at that."
"6854120","6855340"," What do you call this right here?"
"6856220","6857120"," Delta neutral, right?"
"6858200","6859620"," Call this setting up, right?"
"6860180","6860460"," Came down."
"6860640","6861220"," They said, fuck you. "
"6861320","6862160"," We're bringing it right back up."
"6863200","6864260"," And then brought it right back down."
"6864440","6866160"," So they're like right in this zone right here. "
"6867280","6868720"," Leading into this event, right?"
"6871770","6873530"," For a larger move higher or lower."
"6874050","6875970"," So you get that large move higher and lower."
"6876290","6882130"," And there's likely a bunch of spreads that they want to print into the 30th in here, likely. "
"6883010","6884450"," Not guaranteed, but likely."
"6885410","6891250"," So even with all these moves that you see, these moves that you see like that could take place"
"6891250","6891570"," today."
"6892430","6895890"," There's like opportunities for you after the trading day today. "
"6896390","6898370"," It's not like I have to catch that move."
"6898370","6901150"," If the market's going to bloodbath, there's so much down to go."
"6901590","6905350"," If the market's going up, there's so much room to go, 410, 415. "
"6906530","6909650"," I mean, there's space here for you to make a fat chunk of money."
"6913510","6916590"," So if you're not, if you're not a fast trader or if you're not a."
"6918610","6922870"," If you're like, I'm always, even when I'm on the right side cap, I'm on the losing side."
"6924030","6930070"," There's so many easier ways to make money on this event. "
"6931030","6932130"," So many other ways."
"6935640","6940240"," If you're already in a put spread position and we go screaming higher."
"6941420","6946020"," I fucking went to your bunker and just see if it comes back into the money again. "
"6947180","6947740"," Seriously."
"6950260","6952240"," You can always reposition later."
"6952480","6957080"," You can always catch the right up to offset the losses in the short term. "
"6959380","6965340"," There's an overall trend of the market, regardless of some bullshit meeting today with the fed."
"6971750","6975330"," Two on that stuff and I tell you that stuff because that's the stuff that makes you a better"
"6975330","6975610"," trader."
"6976130","6982190"," That's the stuff that keeps you calm when you're excited or you're getting all super bullish, super"
"6982190","6982770"," bearish. "
"6984290","6990990"," That's the stuff that that's a difference maker in being profitable and not being profitable."
"6993030","6994770"," You should have your day planned out today."
"6994830","6998750"," If you're going to make trades or if you're trading this event or if you're going to trade after"
"6998750","7000950"," the event, you should have like, you should write it down. "
"7002270","7008530"," If you go against one of those rules for today, just catch yourself and say, fuck, I ain't doing"
"7008530","7008690"," it."
"7009810","7012270"," I already planned this out before I got to this event."
"7013190","7019390"," What I'm going to do depending on what happens and stick to that trading plan. "
"7020370","7024310"," If that trading plan for you fails, you can always go back to it and say, what the fuck happened?"
"7025650","7026530"," Why did my plan?"
"7026710","7028410"," Why did my plan not work for me today?"
"7030090","7033650"," You can apply these to every one of these events and you can adjust them over time."
"7034770","7036310"," ERs used to not be a non-event."
"7036710","7037510"," They became an event. "
"7038310","7040650"," You have to adjust your plan into those events now, right?"
"7042030","7045470"," You can adjust them over the years, but you should have a trading plan for today."
"7046250","7046950"," You can type it out."
"7047250","7048870"," Think about your brain 16 times. "
"7049430","7052290"," If you think you're going to forget it in the heat of the moment, write it down to piece of"
"7052290","7052550"," paper."
"7052890","7054490"," Get yourself a pencil paper."
"7055910","7057270"," I've got scrap paper all over my desk. "
"7057770","7061770"," I fucking write all kinds of ideas and brainstorming."
"7061810","7066190"," I should have, at least I have an eraser board, but I've moved about a new house and now I'm"
"7066190","7066650"," renovating it."
"7066710","7072170"," I'm sitting on paper, but if you should be doing that or a journal book or something. "
"7073930","7078790"," Then I would have it open while you're trading today and have your trade set up what you're taking."
"7079070","7080770"," You can adjust it as you move forward in time."
"7081590","7086270"," The price of the underlying asset that you're trading today changes. "
"7087370","7089630"," You should be eyeballing that option that you're looking at."
"7090130","7091930"," You should be like looking at the option chain."
"7092050","7096410"," If you're like, Hey, I'm looking at just trading zero dates today. "
"7096510","7098210"," I'm on the November 30th options chain."
"7098790","7102610"," I have a feeling that we're going to stay neutral."
"7103870","7105630"," Into the event to some extent, right?"
"7105790","7107210"," So three ninety five C's, right?"
"7110230","7112690"," They're two dollars and forty four cents right now. "
"7113650","7115390"," Or I'm looking at three ninety sixes."
"7115890","7117770"," Or I'm looking at three ninety eight's."
"7118250","7122690"," You want to see the the ebb and flow of that option all day long, the price changes. "
"7123170","7124450"," And then option the premium."
"7125710","7128110"," Kicking that option, the premium drain in that option."
"7130660","7134120"," You want to set up a one by 10 of those 20 of those 50 those you want to think"
"7134120","7134400"," about. "
"7134980","7135900"," Adding that position."
"7136260","7137340"," You're going to hold that position."
"7137920","7140500"," Start thinking about where you're going to monetize that position. "
"7140500","7141620"," So like let's look at."
"7143180","7147780"," We'll look at a let's see if an upper price target up here of a blast off, right?"
"7149960","7153320"," I'm thinking that where probably we'll probably hit this."
"7153860","7156540"," We'll initially carry liquidity grab and slam right up here. "
"7156940","7158720"," That's four hundred, right?"
"7159140","7159920"," Roughly four hundred."
"7160320","7163260"," So let's say I'm looking at four hundred C's."
"7163980","7164720"," They're fifty one cents. "
"7166400","7166660"," Right."
"7168220","7169040"," Fifty one cents."
"7169480","7170860"," So what do I need to make off that trade?"
"7171540","7171880"," A buck. "
"7172480","7173120"," A buck fifty."
"7173960","7175000"," That's a huge rep, right?"
"7175900","7177580"," I'm not buying those right now, by the way."
"7178200","7179500"," I think we I think we roll. "
"7180280","7181700"," We're going to trap some bulls in here."
"7183120","7184780"," But you can buy them now if you want."
"7184940","7185540"," But they're fifty cents. "
"7185980","7186160"," So."
"7190080","7192060"," I'm going to watch that option all day long."
"7192060","7195360"," And then as soon as we get to a point where I can buy into them for that rip higher. "
"7196180","7197560"," I'm going to try to jump in and out."
"7197880","7198560"," So I buy them."
"7198580","7200360"," Let's say I buy them at fifty cents immediately. "
"7201120","7203560"," I'm going to put a sell order on it for a dollar dollar fifty."
"7204120","7205060"," To that rip higher."
"7206020","7209360"," If some news comes across the wire, that's bullish or dovish. "
"7210640","7211440"," Buy it."
"7211520","7212160"," Whatever the price is."
"7212320","7214940"," Not a market order, but whatever it's the limit is at that moment. "
"7216960","7217680"," Or the ask."
"7218320","7220440"," And then I'm going to put a limit sell on it."
"7221420","7226120"," Because I don't want to blast off and like make it a forty five second trade, minute and a half"
"7226120","7226360"," trade. "
"7227240","7228340"," And not have a fill."
"7229600","7230400"," As we're heading up there."
"7230940","7232640"," So you should be thinking through your trade like. "
"7234160","7236220"," On a larger time frame."
"7236620","7241480"," In weekly time frame, month time frame, weekly time frame, daily time frame, minute time frame."
"7242720","7244000"," Right down to the option you're buying. "
"7244720","7247340"," Right down to watching the oven flow, the price of that option."
"7248240","7249700"," Right down to watching where all the."
"7250140","7250760"," All the. "
"7252560","7254760"," Interest is on the right now on put interest."
"7255880","7258400"," Need to get fuel for rip higher rates."
"7258560","7260940"," You need to buy tons of calls for the put side down. "
"7261160","7265520"," You need to get a bunch of people buying all the puts for a rip higher for the fuel for"
"7265520","7266520"," a call for the call side."
"7266840","7268560"," So this move right now everybody's on puts."
"7269000","7271340"," They're all they're all loaded to the tips on three ninety fours. "
"7271940","7272380"," P's."
"7272760","7274760"," So that could lend fuel to a rip higher."
"7275560","7276940"," You'll be looking at all that stuff. "
"7285740","7286340"," Hey, Meryl."
"7286500","7286860"," How you doing brother?"
"7287400","7287960"," Good to see you."
"7291530","7292250"," Raising for us. "
"7292350","7294690"," Yeah, I don't normally use paper, but that's what I've been doing lately."
"7296070","7298830"," I have to have impact a bunch of shit down impact it."
"7304930","7306670"," We went you guys can go back and watch. "
"7308570","7310530"," If you're just joining us or haven't joined us."
"7310530","7313890"," If you want the template last week in the 28th."
"7313990","7314530"," I think it was 28. "
"7315190","7315930"," Then the fed speaker."
"7316990","7319230"," Executed perfectly trade traded that day."
"7320170","7320650"," Zero. "
"7321390","7321770"," Issues."
"7322870","7323350"," Zero."
"7324030","7324550"," Traded it. "
"7325410","7325890"," Perfect."
"7327390","7330350"," And as you waste away from would say it's all on the fucking tape."
"7331210","7332590"," So we've got the tape of it. "
"7332650","7333170"," It's public."
"7333550","7334490"," You can go right back to it."
"7334750","7337330"," You can scroll right to right around. "
"7337330","7339890"," I think it was one o'clock in the afternoon or two o'clock in the afternoon."
"7340090","7342330"," We talked about it all morning, set it all up."
"7343730","7345050"," News came across the wire. "
"7346050","7346450"," Bullish."
"7347170","7347970"," Grab the rip."
"7348550","7348790"," Sold it. "
"7348970","7351210"," It literally pinged right where we said it would go."
"7352370","7353250"," Took the money and ran."
"7355770","7359670"," Easy fucking trade when it came down to the moment of executing the trade. "
"7359950","7361770"," We had already done all the work to take the trade."
"7365900","7367380"," Some of the tape you guys can go back."
"7367380","7368660"," It's not like we're fucking mitt. "
"7368900","7370920"," Like we're saying shit like after the fact."
"7371360","7372440"," We got the fucking tape."
"7376340","7377540"," So, I don't know. "
"7378540","7380280"," There's a few hundred people here when it happened."
"7382520","7383580"," Mero, good to see you brother."
"7390440","7392060"," Mero, what's your take on today, bro?"
"7392700","7394860"," Give us your if any guys don't know Mero. "
"7396740","7398520"," Old school fucking futures trainer."
"7400180","7401040"," Knows what's up."
"7401040","7406030"," Yeah, I like the whiteboard femme fatale. "
"7411330","7412250"," Herms is in here."
"7413190","7413850"," What's going on?"
"7414090","7414870"," What's going on, Herms?"
"7415530","7417810"," I honestly don't think the Fed wants it up above 4,100."
"7418010","7418310"," Fuck no. "
"7418910","7420270"," I don't think they mind the 4,100."
"7420370","7421130"," That was my other thing."
"7421270","7423070"," I was back in my brain. "
"7423350","7424510"," Herms is bringing up a good point."
"7424810","7426130"," He was saying they don't want it above 4,100."
"7426590","7427430"," I was thinking of my brain. "
"7427630","7434090"," I was like, I wonder if Jay Pals like, how do I finesse where I let them have that 4,"
"7434090","7435890"," 4, 10, that 4, 12?"
"7437150","7439830"," And then we dump it on fucking the 16th of December."
"7440350","7442750"," Like, does he dump it now or does he dump it in the 16th?"
"7446690","7448410"," Herms brings up a good point."
"7450910","7452150"," When does he shit on us?"
"7452450","7453950"," Does he shit on us today or is he?"
"7454490","7457250"," Does he shit on us today and then pump us back up on the 15th?"
"7459990","7463910"," Historically, you don't get the Christmas rally or holiday rally until the middle of December. "
"7466010","7471890"," So maybe they shit on us today and then punch you in the face and then pick you back up"
"7471890","7473750"," and say, there's your holiday rally, asshole."
"7474550","7476290"," You got it for the last two weeks of December."
"7478890","7481010"," Meanwhile, we're zigging while there's zagging. "
"7490280","7492600"," My barefoot's staying on for the whole month of December."
"7492840","7493860"," Bring on the JPM caller."

"7496960","7497880"," You got to believe, baby. "
"7500660","7503320"," That trade works out fucking nine out of ten times."
"7503360","7504340"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"7504680","7506940"," I've seen it not work out, but I've seen that trade. "
"7507460","7509140"," That trade has been very fucking solid."
"7510300","7510780"," That's the same."
"7510940","7515300"," That's basically the same, but my trade is more simple, but it's very similar trade. "
"7526690","7527650"," Oh shit."
"7527850","7528990"," Did Barry really tweet?"
"7529310","7530190"," What the fuck did Barry?"
"7530330","7532750"," Dude, Barry needs to shut the fuck up, man."
"7533850","7536310"," You're not getting a crash of Barry's tweet and a promise. "
"7538630","7542190"," There was a time when he's too famous now."
"7542490","7546150"," He's now a part of the herd, where he creates the herd by him tweeting."
"7546770","7547810"," He's fucked up. "
"7548990","7555340"," Someone needs to call him and let him know that he's now creating the herd."
"7559080","7560140"," Yeah, Fed Blackout."
"7560280","7562780"," Mao is saying the Fed Blackout period starts soon. "
"7563560","7565000"," Last chance to talk to Mark down for CPR."
"7565560","7565760"," CPI."
"7566420","7566840"," Fair point, Mao. "
"7567040","7567360"," Agree with that."
"7569180","7573280"," Mero's saying short December Futes plus long market futures today."
"7574100","7575560"," You might get to cash shorts today. "
"7577920","7579300"," Ideally plummeted to OPEC."
"7579520","7581700"," Chase saying ideally plummet into OPEC's."
"7582520","7585760"," Get a bunch of puts going, then they pump it to end of December. "
"7586280","7591960"," Yeah, you guys ever see like the 2018 when they fucking sold it into the OPEC's?"
"7592280","7595880"," Then they fucking sold it right into December 24th."
"7596480","7597600"," It was fucking ugly."
"7597960","7599020"," Do you guys remember that?"
"7603400","7605120"," Take is that maybe JPOW knock. "
"7605340","7606580"," So it's back down today."
"7606880","7608480"," Then back up and hit 410."
"7610380","7611700"," 410 with December CPI. "
"7612420","7612900"," Then that's what I'm saying."
"7613060","7614740"," Yeah, we got the wacky shit on Friday too, right?"
"7615400","7618260"," We've got the fucking scam, fucking non-farm payroll."
"7618780","7620480"," They can use that to fucking sell the market. "
"7620960","7623000"," Matter of fact, I guarantee, right?"
"7623800","7628240"," If we go up today, they're going to fucking use the non-farm CPL to sell it."
"7628760","7634780"," If we go down today, they're going to use fucking non-farm payroll to pump it so that the banks"
"7634780","7635960"," get their fucking prints on."
"7638520","7642130"," Do not pick directions today. "
"7642290","7643710"," Mero's given the perfect advice."
"7645050","7646030"," I agree with Mero."
"7652270","7653710"," Yeah, you remember that taper tantrum?"
"7653730","7654170"," It was brutal. "
"7655970","7658550"," I thought the taper tantrum was January though."
"7660590","7661690"," Well, no, it was earlier."
"7662290","7662750"," What was it?"
"7662750","7665190"," Let me think back. "
"7667350","7668410"," January is when they stopped."
"7669090","7670770"," Is that when they were in public with easing?"
"7671570","7673030"," And they already hit bottom before, right?"
"7673210","7673570"," They already knew."
"7674910","7676070"," Let's go look. "
"7676530","7677570"," Give them a minute or two, right?"
"7679250","7683390"," Seeing some support right here, seeing some shorts close now, finding some support."
"7683570","7685550"," We're going to go look at something else, but we'll look at 2018."
"7686090","7686830"," I can't remember exactly. "
"7687050","7690830"," I remember it was something like we had the taper tantrum, right?"
"7690830","7691790"," We had the Senate hearings."
"7691790","7692970"," Trump was freaking out."
"7694130","7695470"," That was fucking hilarious. "
"7696530","7701270"," And then all these rich guys got caught with the pants down."
"7702170","7705090"," That was really what the taper tantrum was about."
"7705690","7713630"," And then it was January that they QE or at least stopped rate increases, I think. "
"7714010","7714830"," We'd already bought them."
"7716050","7716750"," They were front running."
"7717670","7718490"," They sold it. "
"7718610","7720310"," They've had that final sell in December."
"7721410","7722630"," Then they front ran it."
"7724330","7731210"," And I think in January or February is when they publicly said, that's actually a good example for"
"7731210","7733030"," what we were talking about earlier this morning. "
"7737470","7739590"," Was it like December 16th?"
"7744600","7747000"," Chase St. Brookings's pro-government will be easy on Powell."
"7747220","7747640"," No tough questions."
"7748060","7748520"," That's a fair point. "
"7749040","7750960"," Chase is a journalist in another life."
"7750960","7755200"," He has some validity to what he says on these topics."
"7761020","7763180"," You would definitely want to be listening to Chase and that kind of stuff. "
"7766530","7769910"," John Haggard, you're saying Jay Powell's approaching the sleepy pig panther with his big rat"
"7769910","7770170"," hammer?"
"7774700","7775940"," I love you, John."
"7781600","7785620"," Yeah, I usually come into the opening price heading into the event."
"7786720","7788240"," And then you'll see some shorts come off. "
"7793480","7795180"," We already know that people were short."
"7795420","7797340"," You already know that people were short."
"7800940","7809100"," You guys remember we were on stream on Wednesday and Friday and we were like, yeah, right here. "
"7809200","7810060"," See that bull trap?"
"7813430","7814850"," This is where the short was, right?"
"7817550","7820550"," Short it down, slam it down, hope for a little bit more."
"7820550","7822570"," And then if you don't get that little bit more, what do you do?"
"7823030","7825210"," Close your short because of the vol that's coming."
"7825330","7826310"," You already made your money right here. "
"7827750","7831590"," If anything, you wait for a spike up and then grab it again to slam it back down again."
"7833830","7836530"," So there'll be a moment where the shorts do come off today."
"7841490","7849220"," Be a pressure valve relief as we head into the one o'clock hour. "
"7857770","7859270"," It's starting to get that right now, right?"
"7861990","7864330"," We are above pivot right now, starting to turn bullish."
"7869950","7872370"," Trying to have a trend break here."
"7872630","7874050"," So we'll start setting up a trend break. "
"7878570","7880610"," We're going to make sure we stay it."
"7880690","7881910"," You want to make sure we stay in that trend."
"7883550","7884890"," Start taking a look at it here. "
"7897720","7900100"," Bull's trying to break out here."
"7906430","7908590"," See if they can hold, that's pretty big right there, right?"
"7913340","7914720"," Clean this up a little bit."
"7924570","7925430"," Just a second here. "
"7938730","7941870"," Bull's breaking out a trend, slam it up, bring it up."
"7942130","7947470"," Now they're on pivot point change, trying to attack a higher high."
"7948090","7951730"," If you start to see us roll out of this trend, be careful. "
"7952370","7953770"," You don't want to see that trend break."
"7954570","7955710"," You can see right now."
"7956330","7957330"," I'm going to say we close that. "
"7964140","7965240"," Hang tight here."
"7969960","7970400"," Okay."
"7971080","7972260"," You guys can see that right there. "
"7978460","7980220"," Nice little conflict with the one minute chart."
"7981120","7982940"," We already looked at five in the 15 minute chart."
"7983140","7985360"," We'll see if we can get a, there might be a dip bite out here. "
"7985440","7986860"," If you can see a nice little roll coming up."
"7987320","7989640"," See this little bloodbath here and then slam it apart."
"7990640","7991800"," See if we can get kind of a move in there. "
"7992420","7993120"," I might take that trade."
"7997100","7998340"," See if I can get it on a trade here."
"8009540","8010800"," You guys want that to be smaller. "
"8012880","8013740"," There's that trend break."
"8014460","8015140"," We'll make this the pivot."
"8017980","8019760"," A little bit thicker right there. "
"8027330","8028370"," See you guys can visualize."
"8044470","8045430"," Yeah, it was something like summer."
"8045550","8046330"," I thought it was January. "
"8046490","8047190"," I couldn't remember exactly."
"8047510","8050930"," I thought I thought that we didn't find out until the until January of the minutes."
"8051410","8052530"," I think they did it in December. "
"8053290","8054090"," We didn't know about it."
"8054170","8054910"," I'll have to go back and look."
"8056070","8060390"," I thought the decline had happened before it was public. "
"8061010","8061670"," I don't remember."
"8068340","8068760"," Yeah."
"8070100","8071860"," I haven't seen that cartoon, John. "
"8072080","8074520"," Can you send me a link on Twitter or something?"
"8074780","8075900"," I'll just be like, here you go, Captain."
"8076560","8077740"," I want to watch the video."
"8082340","8085560"," You guys want to look on a bigger screen here so you can see it. "
"8089310","8089970"," Does that help?"
"8098400","8099760"," Is this helping at all or no?"
"8105720","8107680"," You don't want to see a break right here."
"8110580","8112140"," I like these setups, right?"
"8112300","8120760"," You got one, two, a py or maybe one, two, there's your one and your two."
"8121940","8124860"," What you don't want to see here is this is the pivot, right?"
"8125200","8126620"," You definitely don't want to see. "
"8126620","8129180"," So bears are always looking for like, this is the pivot."
"8130640","8134940"," Bears want to see like, this is the bull trap setup where like bulls come down."
"8135060","8135880"," They're like all pumped up. "
"8135880","8139360"," They're like, yeah, we're going higher and they throw it right back down on you down here."
"8143990","8145230"," Well, I was talking about this yesterday."
"8145230","8147910"," If you see this consolidation, take too long. "
"8149830","8151970"," Consolidation should last just a few minutes, two, three minutes."
"8152130","8154630"," If you're in trend mode, two, three minutes, moving on up."
"8155450","8159990"," If you see weakness right in here, like we're consolidating, we're consolidating, consolidating,"
"8159990","8164910"," consolidating, it's a high risk of a rollover, especially at a pivot point, a gamma point. "
"8166630","8168690"," See how much time we've spent right on this line right here?"
"8176440","8179480"," Trying to look at the book right now to see if it's going to roll or not."
"8203139","8204400"," Here's the VWAP right here."
"8204700","8208760"," Three of ninety four ninety two bulls do not want to give up VWAP here. "
"8210860","8214080"," Still bullish unless you break through VWAP and this consolidation."
"8216559","8218400"," Get that nice little one down here."
"8219440","8222100"," Hopefully you can get a number two right here in this VWAP. "
"8222100","8225500"," One, two, three rocket ship up higher."
"8226139","8227219"," One, two rocket ship up higher."
"8231700","8233420"," Start breaking through VWAP, watch out. "
"8238370","8244309"," We'll extend that a little bit farther down for you so you can see right where VWAP is right there."
"8247410","8249469"," Make this nice and fat so you can see it."
"8260670","8261690"," Yeah, I think they did it. "
"8262150","8265170"," I remember being December, I don't think it became public until January."
"8265170","8265850"," I could be wrong on that."
"8268469","8270070"," Oh, yeah, we love World Cup around here. "
"8271830","8272770"," I love football."
"8276049","8280950"," I played soccer all through my, I was a part of that first generation played at middle school,"
"8280969","8282490"," played travel on team, played high school."
"8283230","8285010"," I played D three soccer. "
"8286209","8290230"," I used it for for scholarship money for economic scholarship."
"8291809","8294170"," And a girl's school, that's true story."
"8294790","8299209"," I went to a, I went to an all-female school that opened up to men. "
"8301570","8303090"," They needed soccer players."
"8304490","8306629"," They had a probationary team for men's soccer."
"8312610","8313930"," I played stopper. "
"8320610","8322830"," And you guys played soccer out there."
"8324250","8325750"," Men, women, them, they."
"8333469","8335770"," And I still got fucked up just like any other sport. "
"8336930","8340730"," Fucks every knees, fucks up your head concussions."
"8342950","8344629"," It really fucked up my kneecaps."
"8346910","8349629"," They've had most of my damage done from that was kneecaps. "
"8350770","8359639"," I think you saying somebody just got rid of over a thousand of SPX"
"8359639","8361000"," 3700C."
"8365160","8365860"," He did."
"8367980","8369820"," I try to tell my kids that shit, man. "
"8369940","8373100"," I'm like, you can dab on all that shit, but you shouldn't be."
"8373100","8374879"," I was like, don't destroy your bodies."
"8378219","8379700"," It's like a book map real quick. "
"8403150","8413740"," Still seems like we're in some kind of a, still a"
"8413740","8414760"," lot of volatility here."
"8419920","8421460"," See these sellers in here."
"8430260","8431540"," It's a nice base though. "
"8443510","8445670"," Trying to see if there's any targets above or below."
"8457260","8459520"," I've got a high price target of 4,000."
"8460480","8461840"," Got a low price target. "
"8463820","8468520"," 39.25. When the event happens, we'll do as well."
"8468940","8470080"," We'll try to open this up again."
"8483210","8486970"," You can see in the bottom of your screen that green and red buyer sellers. "
"8487350","8487370"," Right."
"8488130","8489390"," You'll follow it down here."
"8489490","8491990"," If you can see down here, you'll see we're highlighting here. "
"8492730","8495350"," We have buyers coming into the market."
"8495350","8502170"," We're showing more sellers than buyers, but you can see that there is a bit in the market right"
"8502170","8502430"," now."
"8535980","8539160"," Coming into this, we're coming into this VWAP right now. "
"8540460","8547420"," Let's see if I can make this bigger for you so you can see what we're looking at here."
"8553100","8554800"," Get this on a larger time frame here."
"8556780","8559700"," I don't like this consolidation, I'll be honest with you, I don't. "
"8561460","8562800"," We could, we could go up here."
"8562920","8563900"," I just don't fucking like it."
"8564160","8566000"," We better get a reaction on this VWAP here. "
"8566640","8568020"," Coming into that spot right now."
"8568160","8568860"," I'm going to look at some calls."
"8571440","8575160"," I was looking at 400s earlier, they're now down to 46 cents. "
"8585450","8588030"," It's pretty far outside the money, 400c."
"8589630","8594630"," It'd be nice to take like the 399s, maybe just below, or just below."
"8597110","8597930"," 397s are sweet. "
"8598690","8600510"," They're expensive, they're $1.46, $45."
"8606720","8607920"," They're expensive as fuck."
"8607920","8613640"," I want 397s to like fucking 60 cents, 40 cents, 40 cents. "
"8614220","8616400"," That's what I want to buy 397s at."
"8626180","8627860"," They're not paying on this stuff either."
"8628080","8631720"," If you guys notice in the options chain, like every pump, they're giving you like pennies. "
"8631840","8634480"," They're like, here's five cents, here's another five cents."
"8636320","8638200"," You know, like here's fucking a dollar."
"8641400","8642880"," It's kind of like a trap, right?"
"8645160","8646080"," So let's say we roll. "
"8646220","8647380"," Let's pretend we roll."
"8647580","8648160"," Let's say we roll."
"8648420","8649500"," Let's pretend we roll over. "
"8653520","8655180"," Man, they get so cheap."
"8658900","8659980"," I'm going to set up a trade."
"8666280","8667100"," Let's do 20. "
"8668520","8669320"," They're kind of cheap."
"8671920","8673080"," So I'm looking at a."
"8677200","8678740"," So it's 397, right?"
"8679000","8688700"," 397s are a little pricey, $1.42. Maybe like take three, 399, get out of them and then jump back"
"8688700","8689040"," in them."
"8695560","8698700"," We're going to extend this down further. "
"8699120","8701800"," See if we get a catch down below if this rolls over."
"8702700","8704060"," I'm still on that pivot."
"8704840","8705500"," I don't like this. "
"8705640","8706040"," See this right here?"
"8706260","8707660"," See where my cursor is right here?"
"8707820","8710820"," This is that pivot line, and we're still having gotten above it, right?"
"8711460","8711900"," We're above it."
"8712040","8714680"," We're trading below it, trading below it, trading below it, trading below it."
"8716940","8719140"," Bears, bears, just getting back in on it again. "
"8719960","8721700"," We have my eyes on 399s."
"8723380","8725900"," I should probably have my eyes on like 398s."
"8726400","8727140"," Let me clear this out. "
"8727700","8730820"," If you have an initial spike up, I don't think we're going to get the."
"8732120","8733500"," I don't think we're going to tag 400."
"8733680","8734920"," I think we're going to tag just below. "
"8735440","8737700"," Couple strikes just below then reverse course."
"8740100","8740800"," There's 20."
"8741120","8742140"," Third dollar right now. "
"8742440","8743040"," I haven't bought them yet."
"8743200","8744700"," If I buy them, I'll let you know."
"8744700","8753220"," If you're tuning in with us right now, and you want to, in real time, follow along with trades that"
"8753220","8758700"," I take, as I set up a trade and get ready to place a trade, you can go to the"
"8758700","8768720"," gear icon on YouTube, the settings gear icon on your YouTube stream, and it will, it'll"
"8770920","8771260"," do what?"
"8772660","8780020"," You can hit the gear icon, then go to playback speed and then hit times two, and that will allow"
"8780020","8782300"," you to catch up to almost real time. "
"8782480","8788780"," YouTube has a, has a built in delay of like 15 seconds."
"8789180","8790880"," If you speed it up, I'll sound like a clown."
"8791300","8796420"," I'm already a clown as it is, but you know, my voice will turn clownish for about five or six"
"8796420","8801920"," seconds, and maybe seven seconds, and then you'll come real time. "
"8802200","8806500"," Sometimes you have to do it every 15 minutes, half an hour, but if we're going into a trade, if"
"8806500","8808060"," you want to follow along, you've got to pay for trade it."
"8808700","8816860"," If you just want to follow as it happens, you're more than welcome to follow along in real time."
"8821330","8824030"," I'm starting to see the moving averages curl underneath here. "
"8824030","8832290"," And then you'll be like two, three seconds off from wherever I am and wherever you are in the"
"8832290","8832510"," world."
"8840050","8841190"," No news right now."
"8841990","8842650"," Everybody's quiet. "
"8852030","8853130"," What are you guys saying here?"
"8853470","8854050"," So you got the same."
"8855290","8856410"," Yeah, I'm bearish today."
"8860950","8861890"," I'm bearish today. "
"8862170","8864410"," I'm open to, I'm open to a trade."
"8864410","8869710"," I'm open to a trade, I'm open to a trade heading into."
"8869910","8872550"," So let me show you guys I'm open to with our processes here. "
"8875510","8877170"," So this is the one o'clock hour."
"8877290","8879430"," This is just before the J pal thing."
"8880750","8884110"," I'm open to some kind of a, I don't know if it'll happen, but I'm open to some kind of"
"8884110","8889790"," a roll down briefly below and then to see shorts close at some point. "
"8891370","8892970"," It's like that one o'clock hour."
"8894450","8896070"," Something, some kind of a move like this."
"8896210","8896650"," I'm looking for. "
"8902350","8906570"," Use the shorts closing their positions as a lift up just like you use dealers."
"8907870","8907970"," Right."
"8908870","8910990"," Use shorts for, for, for repair. "
"8911570","8913730"," And then I would expect to roll fail maybe."
"8914930","8915670"," Back here."
"8917430","8918950"," So this is the trade I'm looking at. "
"8922280","8923300"," This is a pre."
"8926190","8930270"," A pre, um, pre, not FMC."
"8931110","8932610"," Pretty bullshit. "
"8933210","8934770"," Brookings bullshit day."
"8935370","8936810"," The day we have to create ball."
"8938270","8941250"," Data create nonsense nonsense ball for a day. "
"8941710","8944030"," Keep them, keep the fucking market participants happy."
"8951890","8953150"," Yeah, put this thing on."
"8953290","8953670"," I don't know. "
"8953950","8956130"," So this, this little gold coin that you see."
"8956410","8957270"," Oh, let me see if it's up here."
"8957630","8958930"," This little gold coin that you see. "
"8959170","8960510"," I set it up, but it's not working."
"8960910","8961510"," I think so."
"8961530","8967070"," If you like or subscribe, I think it throws like your name goes across the screen or something. "
"8967490","8971330"," If you donate like a 25 cents throws quarters in."
"8971330","8972410"," I'm not sure."
"8972630","8974310"," It's not where I don't think it's working right now. "
"8974610","8977730"," If any of you guys aren't, I had, I think I had people subscribe today."
"8978010","8978970"," Can't comment on this."
"8979090","8979710"," Just subscribe. "
"8980750","8982110"," So if you, what do you guys want to subscribe?"
"8982330","8983310"," It should show up here."
"8983970","8985290"," Your name should show up."
"8985290","8989930"," And then it should sprinkle some, some fucking thing like a something, but I don't see it"
"8989930","8990170"," happening. "
"8990170","8990710"," So whatever."
"8991390","8992290"," It's not fucking working."
"8993890","8995610"," But that would be a cool little thing. "
"8996290","8999330"," So I was like, I'll throw that on there, but it's not working right now."
"8999330","9003230"," And so I have no fucking idea off the check and see it."
"9003310","9008770"," I'm assuming that it's just assuming that for whatever reason, it's not working. "
"9008770","9011950"," It's fucking something in the code."
"9014150","9014850"," So whatever."
"9015350","9015850"," I'll run it. "
"9016390","9020410"," I ran streams all night long with a bunch of different updates."
"9020650","9021770"," I got a bunch of shit for you guys."
"9022610","9023370"," We're rolling out. "
"9023570","9026610"," But of course, everything you roll out has problems."
"9026610","9027990"," I have to send emails."
"9028630","9030510"," I have to interview, talk to. "
"9031070","9037850"," And I have to sizing issues and then font decisions and then blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,"
"9038130","9038130"," blah."
"9038790","9040170"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"9040470","9044190"," Tony Cheese just tipped $4.20. Oh, it worked. "
"9044610","9044750"," Fuck."
"9045030","9045170"," Yeah."
"9047590","9048630"," Yeah, it worked. "
"9052150","9054210"," So it did work."
"9055210","9057590"," So we'll see if the trades go well or not."
"9057710","9058550"," I don't fucking know. "
"9059450","9061310"," So I'm working on this shit all night long."
"9062010","9063590"," I can stupid shit."
"9064270","9066390"," Who does that Tony Cheese, baby?"
"9069730","9076070"," $4.20. Thank you, bro. "
"9080110","9081310"," So it does work."
"9081930","9082330"," Okay."
"9082730","9083650"," I got some cool shit, though. "
"9083750","9086270"," I got like a I had like a whole interview thing."
"9086270","9090610"," So you have people on seeing like two pictures of people and then I need a chart in the background."
"9090610","9092710"," So you guys can always be looking at the charts as we talk. "
"9093410","9097210"," And then, of course, I got I want to have I'm trying to put on."
"9099150","9104610"," Some of you guys don't have access to the chat because you've got it on like a big screen TV."
"9105330","9106650"," Boy, you're on a cell phone. "
"9107710","9115070"," And so I wanted to be able to have the chat at least on the screen somewhere."
"9115170","9119070"," So if you're on a cell phone or if you're on a big TV and you don't want to partake"
"9119070","9123590"," in talking, you could at least follow along with the context of our conversations."
"9124350","9128410"," So I've got one set up on the book map screen, but not on this screen yet. "
"9128570","9129750"," I haven't found a place for it."
"9129770","9131290"," I think I'm going to put it in the bottom right hand side."
"9131290","9140390"," But where that Jerome Powell thing is, but I didn't have the time to build it and in like mute. "
"9141650","9144650"," This thing and then bring up the chat on the full screen."
"9144930","9146030"," So I want you guys to have all that stuff."
"9147590","9149630"," Look at that nice little roll over down here. "
"9149670","9150370"," Check that out."
"9151830","9155910"," It's almost like they knew it's almost like they knew they were coming down here."
"9156650","9160990"," So now I'm going to look over at the at those three 98 C's. "
"9161090","9162710"," They're getting cheaper there with 91 cents now."
"9164030","9165770"," You guys see this roll down here?"
"9167290","9169770"," I was just talking about this last night."
"9170150","9173310"," I was just talking about this roll over last night. "
"9173430","9176990"," I was like, it's been a little too much time in this consolidation turns into a little bit of"
"9176990","9177310"," distribution."
"9178110","9179930"," How can you identify that it's happening?"
"9181290","9184050"," How do you find out when this is going to get so deep?"
"9184050","9185230"," Look it is right now."
"9185390","9187270"," So you're not entering your trades. "
"9189110","9191570"," So you're not entering your trades the wrong time, right?"
"9191870","9193190"," Timing your trades, right?"
"9193850","9196290"," So let's say we are still like, yeah, we're going up."
"9196790","9199110"," Did you enter here or did you enter here?"
"9199910","9203930"," Because you'll fucking maybe break even by the time you're up there, right?"
"9204070","9205590"," So you want to enter your trades the right time."
"9207190","9210510"," You want to plan out your trades, make sure that you're getting the best position possible. "
"9210510","9213790"," So if you're taking along, you know where to take it."
"9215270","9216990"," So you keep that money in your pocket."
"9218350","9218710"," Right?"
"9218950","9220990"," Because at the end of the day, all the talking, all the bullshit doesn't matter. "
"9221130","9224270"," The only thing that matters is that the money goes in your pocket as a trader."
"9224530","9225710"," That you're picking the right place."
"9226930","9228690"," You have your plan and then you're looking. "
"9229450","9229890"," Oh, yeah."
"9230150","9231450"," Yeah, baby."
"9232950","9234170"," Oh, the market rebel. "
"9234530","9235090"," What's up, brother?"
"9236750","9237510"," Who's out there?"
"9237510","9238410"," You have market rebel."
"9241190","9242830"," Oh, my God, a whole lot here."
"9243710","9244870"," Shout out to the market rebel. "
"9244870","9246230"," Shout out to the femnon fatales."
"9246350","9247310"," Shout out to Tony Cheese."
"9250120","9250900"," Shout to Angel. "
"9251220","9252240"," Shout to James Andreas."
"9253640","9255040"," Sano yako is supporting the stream."
"9255220","9256740"," All you guys read on. "
"9258740","9261200"," So it's like these little things right here that you need to know about, right?"
"9261380","9264700"," These are the things that I was trying to, I was talking to Joe Donut the other day."
"9265400","9266500"," And I was like, you know what?"
"9269520","9276800"," I was like, I fucking read all these books and I took these classes and I went to discords and"
"9276800","9277720"," I'm like reading all this stuff."
"9277960","9279040"," This is all over the years, right?"
"9280020","9283360"," Then I'm on social media all these years, not until Sator. "
"9284880","9287700"," Not until fucking Sator took me into a private group."
"9288240","9289500"," They start to get some mentorship."
"9290740","9291840"," And then I sought out mentors. "
"9291840","9298100"," And I think that's the missing part oftentimes in all this thing is you're not with somebody live"
"9298100","9298500"," going."
"9299660","9301240"," Hey, let's look at the market right now."
"9301460","9302320"," Let's spend a few hours. "
"9302500","9303900"," Let's spend eight hours a day together."
"9306490","9309470"," And you want to spend eight hours a day together with some guy or some woman or whatever."
"9310130","9318140"," You want to spend like fucking a month with Mr. Yen or with whoever else. "
"9318320","9320820"," There's a couple of options millionaires out there doing that stuff."
"9321440","9328440"," There's a core group of like traders that are out there and they spend time with other traders just"
"9328440","9329480"," so you can be with someone else."
"9332000","9336840"," The trade is markets all day long so you can like that one on one shit. "
"9337080","9338280"," You can't pay for that shit."
"9338880","9339240"," You do."
"9339420","9343420"," I know there are guys out there that charge like 600 bucks a person. "
"9344040","9345280"," And they're like, I'm the alpha guy."
"9345520","9348280"," And then you find out when you pay the 600 bucks a month they come on for an hour in"
"9348280","9349080"," the fuck once a week."
"9349700","9352040"," They're like, I'll be there on Friday at nine a.m. till noon. "
"9352820","9354120"," Like, what the fuck is that?"
"9354500","9357720"," What if we have a huge market event or a market move and you're not there?"
"9358300","9358380"," Yes."
"9358480","9363600"," Grew by two sport, four percent to 12 spots to seven million barrels per day in September."
"9363920","9365300"," The high since March, 2020. "
"9365680","9366240"," How's that guy?"
"9366340","9367640"," I'm a fucking alpha guy."
"9367740","9368320"," That's fucking crazy."
"9368960","9370560"," You want like alpha guys?"
"9370700","9372280"," By ticks, right?"
"9372840","9375560"," Alpha guys are just looking guys to trade all day long. "
"9380320","9381000"," That's smart."
"9381420","9382320"," They're not fucking special."
"9382680","9384960"," But what they are is they're available all day every day. "
"9385300","9387140"," And they're available to you all day every day."
"9388380","9392120"," One of the fuckers that call themselves alpha guys are fucking selling you that they show up for"
"9392120","9393340"," your 600 bucks once a week."
"9393880","9394700"," Some fucking nonsense. "
"9395660","9395900"," Whatever."
"9396160","9397220"," I'll be quiet now."
"9397780","9398180"," No more ants. "
"9399740","9400620"," No more ants."
"9407820","9408160"," Leaky."
"9408800","9413780"," I always love Winky. "
"9414380","9415720"," Winky's like, draw that little line in there."
"9415820","9416620"," What when you draw that line?"
"9420060","9421620"," Winky's like, draw that little line down there."
"9428900","9430080"," He's like, show them the line cap. "
"9431700","9432700"," This one right here."
"9433160","9435680"," This is always the one Winky talks about that one right there."
"9436920","9438580"," He's like, oh shit, he's going to extend it. "
"9438980","9439580"," That's not good."
"9445800","9447360"," Look at fucking book map."
"9447520","9449100"," Just fucking bloodbath in it, bleeding. "
"9450960","9453080"," What can we learn from book map right now?"
"9456670","9458470"," We'll be looking for a bounce down here, right?"
"9459570","9461490"," This is the initial move down here, right?"
"9462090","9463250"," Stepping us down right here."
"9463350","9466390"," You can see too, we're coming into some sort of support right where we are."
"9466750","9468510"," Like right now, look at the candle to the stick chart. "
"9468650","9471630"," There is some support right there where my cursor is."
"9471950","9473410"," But they're stepping us down, right?"
"9473510","9476450"," Let's go house and senate negotiations agree to add."
"9476650","9477810"," Stepping us down right now. "
"9477850","9478890"," Vodens defense budget."
"9482940","9483560"," Look at that."
"9483700","9484160"," Stepped down. "
"9487550","9489230"," I'm going to show it to you on the."
"9492670","9496070"," I'm going to show it to you on the main book map screen."
"9498170","9499010"," Look at that, right?"
"9500430","9501750"," Giant fucking volatility up there. "
"9502410","9503810"," Just trying to slam it down."
"9508630","9510330"," Just look at this right here, right?"
"9511190","9513870"," Look at the size of these sellers moving in right now."
"9514490","9516950"," Trying to just push it down, push it down, push it down. "
"9518550","9519330"," It's kind of crazy."
"9523520","9526180"," Hidden sellers down there just trying to smash, smash, smash."
"9529200","9530620"," See if we get the bounce right here. "
"9530900","9532080"," This might be the bounce right here."
"9535450","9536610"," See if we get that bounce."
"9547920","9549180"," Oh, you guys are awesome. "
"9550900","9552120"," You guys are awesome."
"9553120","9554960"," Alright, so we're going to look right here."
"9555020","9556380"," We're going to keep the book map up here, right?"
"9556380","9557580"," See if they keep stepping us down. "
"9557980","9559600"," Or if we're going to catch a bounce, right?"
"9561000","9563560"," Those 398 C's are now down to 86 cents."
"9563680","9564900"," They're like a dollar two at one point."
"9565420","9567640"," So you've shaved off like 20% of their value. "
"9568220","9570020"," It's kind of cleaning the clock on those calls."
"9570380","9571660"," I'm not in them, but I'm looking at them."
"9571660","9572780"," I'm going to get my eyeballs on them. "
"9574000","9576380"," Talked about, or you showed you earlier, right?"
"9576500","9578760"," Showed you that want to see some kind of a dip down below."
"9579540","9582760"," Shorts kind of want to close it out around that one o'clock hour."
"9583440","9584140"," Take their money and run. "
"9585720","9587620"," Too risky for a short to be short."
"9587940","9590400"," At least into like big shorts."
"9590440","9591800"," They're going to close that at some point. "
"9591980","9596500"," So we'll wait and see if we can catch a little, a little rip down down here and see what"
"9596500","9597980"," happens just below right now."
"9598080","9600200"," VWAP's right here broken below."
"9600280","9602140"," We've broken below the pivot. "
"9603180","9607140"," You've broken below starting to stretch down below VWAP."
"9607980","9610520"," See if we can catch a nice dip in a rip higher."
"9611760","9612920"," So according to a survey. "
"9612920","9614720"," There's all happy right now."
"9614780","9617940"," Apply with a hundred and sixty three percent of pledge cuts in November."
"9618060","9619720"," We're going to go into the same survey. "
"9619900","9624940"," Opex quota bound members on the shoot November output target by eight hundred thousand barrels per"
"9624940","9629060"," day versus the one spot three six million barrel for day short fall in October."
"9629800","9634260"," And the ice has crude production in New Mexico group by four spot seven percent two hundred and"
"9634260","9635760"," sixty eight million barrels per day."
"9636320","9639220"," In September highest on record blood red. "
"9640280","9642700"," Bears taken charge slip below pivot."
"9643320","9643820"," Come up."
"9644500","9645160"," Trappable. "
"9645980","9647220"," Slam him right down."
"9649960","9650880"," Blood red."
"9657230","9658360"," Let's get some blood going. "
"9661170","9663560"," Target down below three third three ninety three ninety nine."
"9664340","9666200"," Three ninety three twenty four."
"9668480","9669400"," Blood red. "
"9670320","9672460"," Bears really want this one right here."
"9672460","9674760"," If a beer had a payday they'd be like oh please."
"9675760","9677120"," Let's get some blood red going. "

"10739590","10740790"," Ten seconds."
"10751720","10754520"," Feds Cook says US manufacturing sector is healthy. "
"10755200","10758600"," It says inflation is much too high and the third must bring it down to 2%."
"10758600","10762420"," The third will learn what restrictive restrictive rate is over time."
"10762920","10766960"," This is housing costs inflation likely to add to overall for some time. "
"10770160","10773460"," Feds Cook says Fed has taken strong steps to control inflation."
"10773860","10777120"," This is interest rate sensitive parts of the economy impacted by Fed hikes."
"10777660","10781200"," This is mindful past Fed rate hikes still working through the economy. "
"10781880","10787000"," Feds Cook says inflation is still too high and the main focus Fed focus is low in price pressures."
"10787860","10791180"," Feds Cook says I'm seeing some early signs of improvement in inflation data."
"10791820","10794740"," This is too soon to say inflation trends are turning more friendly over time. "
"10794740","10800260"," Feds Cook says wage growth is above levels consistent with the Fed's 2% version target."
"10800760","10804360"," As the US productivity has been lackluster and hopes it will improve."
"10804940","10807060"," Again, the US manufacturing sector is healthy. "
"10819580","10826100"," It just bought 396C for $1.32. It's just worth noting Feds Cook is a voting member of the Fed"
"10826100","10826540"," this year."
"10832380","10837940"," If we start bleeding below this line right here, I'm going to try to hold this trade right here."
"10840780","10845060"," If we start breaking below this 39324, I'm going to get out of the trade. "
"10869120","10871100"," Hang tight with me just for a second here guys."

"10915600","10916540"," Come on baby."
"10928790","10930510"," They're really stepping in here. "
"10946760","10947520"," Come on."
"10953230","10953870"," Push higher."
"10961320","10962780"," It's not going to happen is it?"
"10987420","10988220"," All right. "
"10994240","10995040"," I'm out."
"10996340","10997740"," This last five pennies."
"11003890","11006290"," They're really fucking pushing to dump this shit. "
"11008510","11010970"," They want to see that 3925 down here."
"11012870","11014010"," They're really looking."
"11014210","11016550"," They want to really want to push this down right here right now. "
"11020850","11023310"," There is some fair support down here."
"11023470","11026570"," There's a large, large bid down here to buy."
"11028510","11029450"," We could go up here. "
"11029570","11030470"," You guys can stay in the trade."
"11030650","11035090"," I was hoping we'd get this one little thing in that Fed speaker, but that Fed speaker is kind of"
"11035090","11035390"," neutral."
"11035390","11037830"," He's not really bullish or hawkish or davish. "
"11040610","11041710"," I'm out of this trade."
"11042090","11042710"," I don't like it."
"11045350","11047590"," I'm going to look to buy some calls down here if we can. "
"11047790","11048670"," This might keep going up."
"11048850","11050430"," I don't like it for me personally."
"11054530","11055770"," Let's look at Tesla real quick. "
"11055970","11056870"," We're going to take a quick look at Tesla."
"11058670","11061730"," I'm going to try to enter a trade right here."
"11061950","11063830"," I'm going to try to enter a trade down here now. "
"11063830","11067850"," I'm going to have a, I'm hoping I can get a bleed down right here."
"11068190","11069090"," Let's quick slam down."
"11069570","11071190"," There's a stack of buyers. "
"11071490","11074430"," If you look on the, if you look on book map, that little yellow bar at the bottom."
"11075710","11081400"," There's a, uh, see my cursor down here?"
"11083380","11090880"," There's a large standing order down here for 320, 328."
"11094860","11099220"," Order down here that I'm like, man, if they try to fucking quick rip. "
"11099400","11100080"," Look at what we're going up."
"11102100","11105600"," If they, if they try to slam it down in here for a minute, I'm going to try to grab"
"11105600","11112480"," that, but, um, I will, I should have stayed in this trade, but I didn't."
"11112520","11113960"," I want to see that roll over down here. "
"11114920","11116600"," Too risky, too dangerous."
"11122430","11124090"," We'll see if it fights us way north right now."
"11124830","11126230"," It starts blasting off. "
"11129910","11131730"," Look at that trade right there."
"11131970","11133810"," It's a fucking sweet trade right there."
"11142030","11145770"," Okay, so I'm going to look for, um, someone will get Tesla real quick. "
"11146490","11148590"," Someone's been asked about Tesla, so we're going to talk about Tesla."
"11150010","11154680"," Let me see, um, Tesla."
"11155940","11157540"," I'm going to be quick about it. "
"11158100","11159420"," I'm just going to close this up."
"11170980","11171560"," Tank tighter."
"11198310","11199870"," It's in a larger time frame here. "
"11201630","11203170"," All right, so we are trading higher here."
"11204570","11205850"," Uh, spies trading higher right now."
"11205950","11207130"," I should have, I should have taken that trade. "
"11207410","11210130"," Well, I took the trade, but I fucking lost five cents and that shit."
"11210810","11212610"," I should have taken it fucking held it, but whatever."
"11219800","11221540"," Price target above somewhere up in here. "
"11223320","11225780"," 390, 394, 50 or so."
"11226400","11227180"," We're going to take a quick look."
"11227340","11228500"," I want to go over to Tesla real quick. "
"11229580","11230400"," Um, so the time."
"11230580","11231020"," Okay."
"11231820","11234100"," I'm trying to speak. "
"11238380","11242240"," So the thing about Tesla down here is this is where my price target is down below here."
"11242660","11243280"," I guess 136."
"11243860","11249240"," If you look at, oh, hold on. "
"11251440","11251920"," Okay."
"11252640","11253080"," Hold on."
"11253160","11254620"," I got to do some technical stuff in the background. "
"11255160","11256880"," So if you're looking at Tesla over here, right?"
"11257920","11261700"," Uh, it was kind of nice to see that being put on a bullish note, right?"
"11262080","11264560"," Trading down in here, swooped down, right?"
"11265140","11266160"," Bought right back up."
"11267220","11268000"," Bam, right?"
"11269040","11271280"," And we're in this like directionless zone right here, right?"
"11271600","11277820"," One problem in here is that you've tagged the 61% or you tagged the 50% than the 61 "
"11277820","11278640","% twice."
"11278640","11279380"," That's bullshit. "
"11279720","11283760"," Jazzy says the economy is a lot more uncertain than previously thought."
"11288550","11291470"," And you really are looking for some kind of a failure down in here."
"11292130","11293330"," I want to say this to you. "
"11294030","11295350"," And it's kind of a swoop higher."
"11295490","11298530"," The reason I'm saying that is because, uh, and even let's see you get it today."
"11298630","11299870"," Let's see you get the push up higher. "
"11301290","11303270"," Uh, let's say you're bullish in the end of the year."
"11303810","11306590"," Give me, we can call the bull case here and you'll say you're bullish here."
"11307270","11309870"," Uh, you're still looking for that, for that dip down below. "
"11309870","11311710"," And it's because of just the market."
"11311990","11316630"," You're not going to really see, you're not going to see the market at some point roll over at 410"
"11316630","11318010"," and not see this lower price."
"11318670","11323710"," You're not going to see this, you're going to either see the lower, lower price today with J-POW or"
"11323710","11324850"," you're going to see it down the road. "
"11325710","11327990"," Uh, so you have no, no direction right now."
"11328310","11329710"," Decision on the direction of Tesla."
"11330370","11332990"," So it's, it's difficult to be like, yeah, we're going down here. "
"11333070","11333630"," We're going up."
"11333810","11334850"," So you have to look at other places."
"11335610","11340050"," Um, so you're, the implication would be that you're going to look for, do we get weakness today?"
"11341230","11342370"," Or do we get weakness at 410?"
"11342690","11343830"," What does this correlate to 410?"
"11344730","11347230"," Uh, you need, you need fuel for Tesla to go up. "
"11347310","11351610"," I know it decouples from the market at times, but let's, let's look at it realistically, right?"
"11352010","11352530"," Break higher."
"11353770","11354790"," Take the money and run."
"11354970","11356310"," Short step back in, right?"
"11356450","11357850"," We got some supply up here, right?"
"11358070","11359510"," Short trying to sell it down. "
"11360210","11361770"," Stepping back in again, stronger."
"11362230","11363770"," Stepping back in is stronger."
"11364050","11366850"," We do have declining strength and short, shorting this down. "
"11366850","11369090"," Does it mean we can't squeeze up higher here?"
"11369330","11369870"," Yes, it does."
"11370330","11373970"," But the shorts will step right back at it again, trying to send it back down over here."
"11374630","11376650"," Uh, so I think it's a bull, Tesla bull. "
"11377390","11382010"," Um, yeah, I guess that an intraday trades the possibility it goes up, but where do I want to buy?"
"11382150","11382810"," I want to buy down here."
"11384410","11385950"," This is where I want to buy in Tesla."
"11387030","11388770"," Like buying whole Tesla down here somewhere. "
"11389390","11390750"," See, I was potential for a move higher."
"11391250","11392130"," How long does it last though?"
"11392290","11392590"," Is it last?"
"11393530","11394870"," Is it last just today?"
"11395330","11398570"," Does it last until spy hits 410 or 415?"
"11399610","11401210"," Uh, how long are you holding it for?"
"11401530","11404230"," What's the risk of you buying it on a day like today with J-POW?"
"11404530","11406170"," Does risk there buying this move?"
"11407530","11409890"," Uh, what I would recommend is wait until J-POW speaks."
"11410770","11414110"," So for the direct for direction to be found because no direction yet, right?"
"11414850","11417970"," Consolidation in here, coiling right here for a big move up or down. "
"11418730","11423910"," I'll wait for the J-POW talk and then I would, I would say, take it long to 410."
"11423910","11430390"," Uh, on spy, it takes, uh, Tesla long to fort to, until spy gets to 410."
"11430910","11434550"," If we start to roll and we pick a direction lower here, I'd be taking it. "
"11434730","11438930"," If J-POW is bearish, I'd be taking it all the way down to like one, right here, 146, 136,"
"11439850","11440250"," somewhere in there."
"11441030","11442870"," Uh, so that's my take on Tesla."
"11444930","11447710"," Does that make sense about Tesla and on a larger timeframe?"
"11448830","11450390"," Is that it's still directionless. "
"11450390","11456250"," So if you're looking at it at a longer period of time, uh, and then you know it decouples from,"
"11456270","11459630"," from spy, but let's say spy decides it's going to go slam 410."
"11460430","11464490"," You'd have plenty of time to get into a Tesla long with the spy at 410."
"11464570","11467310"," You'd take that trade with confidence, right?"
"11468050","11474270"," If J-POW becomes bearish today and we've got OPEC's on the 30th, uh, you could see a swing low"
"11474270","11476810"," where you could buy a dip for even a pump higher down the road. "
"11476810","11484870"," Uh, so I don't think like a Tesla trade is, uh, something that you set up for like an hour"
"11484870","11487890"," before he speaks or two hours, two hours before he speaks."
"11488050","11494770"," I think you're looking, I think as a Tesla bull, or even a Tesla bear, you're looking for, uh, a"
"11494770","11504270"," signal of direction, but you're looking for a couple things."
"11504810","11509770"," You're looking for, um, seasonally, when do we have a Santa rally?"
"11510370","11512270"," You know that VIX is low right now. "
"11512350","11514130"," You'd like to buy a Tesla on a high VIX."
"11515270","11519150"," You'd like to find some support in, uh, bond the bond market, right?"
"11519930","11522470"," You'd like to see Dixie rolling over all those kind of things."
"11522750","11527810"," So, uh, should you take a, should you take like a high risk trade on long on Tesla right now"
"11527810","11528430"," at this moment?"
"11528430","11534890"," Uh, if you take that 10, if you take that 10 times, you know what you're going to be, right?"
"11535550","11541590"," You might have like a 500% day once, and then you might have 200% days. "
"11542270","11545990"," And then you're going to have seven full ass blaster losses."
"11549490","11552910"," Um, so my point with my point here is, um, on a larger timeframe."
"11553090","11554870"," No, do I think you buy Tesla here?"
"11555530","11557530"," No, it hit it's 50% retracement. "
"11557530","11558870"," Then it hit at 61%."
"11559430","11561050"," It's golden retracement."
"11561950","11565810"," And, um, then it, then it traded lower, right?"
"11565910","11568270"," We had a lower high on Tesla and we're coming in some volatility. "
"11569490","11573190"," Uh, you're talking about relatively speaking, VIX is low right now."
"11574250","11577130"," Uh, so how long is that pump good for?"
"11578430","11583850"," Um, no, I don't, I don't think, I don't think that, I think it's too risky for both bears and"
"11583850","11584490"," bulls to make."
"11584490","11590610"," Uh, to make a trade that's high, high probability of winning on Tesla. "
"11593210","11597070"," I think when you see people come out, like you see certain people come out on Twitter and they go"
"11597070","11597590"," long Tesla."
"11598810","11602510"," Uh, they know that there's other factors."
"11603930","11605830"," Give a high probability of that trade winning. "
"11612560","11615540"," So if I said long Tesla and Tesla went up today."
"11615540","11620520"," I would tell you that, uh, that was pure fucking chance."
"11622220","11623500"," Absolute pure chance. "
"11626250","11627950"," Coming into this one o'clock hour."
"11628610","11632150"," Uh, looks like shorts are starting to close and not getting that roll over."
"11632650","11634130"," Bears aren't getting it down here. "
"11635230","11639830"," It's looking more and more bullish into at least the closing of, of calls."
"11640470","11643730"," Or excuse me, closing of shorts arguments."
"11646610","11650130"," Let me see if I can show you guys that pivot point again, but down below. "
"11650670","11652730"," Uh, bear case heading into the one o'clock hour."
"11653490","11655150"," Uh, not looking so hot right now."
"11655550","11657270"," Uh, no bears wanted this down below. "
"11657430","11658250"," This is like they're getting it."
"11660210","11662850"," There's gonna be another attempt here by the bulls to go bigger."
"11663710","11667030"," Uh, try to ride up shorts, closing short positions. "
"11668070","11672990"," So that shorts can get a better position into, uh, the one 30 hour."
"11673270","11675470"," The pivot point above this point of control above."
"11675750","11679570"," I guess on intraday trade with gamma, uh, 395 29. "
"11681010","11682670"," It's been a magnet all day long."
"11683010","11683690"," Sell down below it."
"11683810","11684530"," Come back up to it. "
"11684570","11685270"," Sell down below it."
"11685390","11686130"," Come back up to it."
"11686630","11688290"," Bears really want to slam that 390. "
"11689970","11691270"," Not happening, right?"
"11691470","11693870"," I've been trying for two days to slam that to that 390."
"11694250","11695330"," They've been wanting that so bad."
"11695330","11696310"," Bears want that 390. "
"11696830","11699610"," And you can see that they're just not going to print those puts."
"11699990","11701350"," They're not printing those 390s."
"11701870","11703570"," Just keep stopping it and stopping it. "
"11704350","11706270"," Keep magnet right back to that 395."
"11706510","11708210"," Three, and if I was a magnet for a few days now."
"11710010","11712190"," Let's see if I can put the, uh, book map back up. "
"11716890","11718250"," Yeah, it's like that Tesla trade."
"11718690","11721870"," You know, there's a, there's a, you want to trade Tesla with confidence."
"11722290","11723190"," You know, you can get burned. "
"11723790","11724970"," You know how Tesla is."
"11724970","11727450"," I mean, Tesla's like, I love Tesla."
"11727990","11730950"," I love trading Tesla, but I don't like getting burned on Tesla. "
"11732270","11737390"," How many times have you, how many times have you, maybe, I remember years ago, I'd like, like"
"11737390","11741610"," buying like $15 contracts and $7 contracts on Tesla and shit."

"11767210","11769630"," And you want to make a pretty big decision."
"11769910","11774710"," I'd rather buy the 70 cents or $1.50 contract on Tesla when it's fucking blood red."
"11775330","11778350"," And then have it ramp up to $25, right?"
"11778650","11780990"," So when you're seeing this like directionless Tesla. "

"12200440","12201540"," you should be looking elsewhere. "
"12201900","12203200"," You should be looking around the market as well."

"12231580","12236040"," Uh, I'm not going to, I'll never argue with anyone that wants to take, you know, fade me or take"
"12236040","12237620"," more trades than I would take."
"12238560","12240500"," Uh, I've blown up enough accounts. "
"12241180","12250120"," I've, I've, I've torched, I've, I've torched so much money that, um, you know, I just don't need to"
"12250120","12251000"," take those trades anymore."

"12292840","12294240"," You're about to squeeze higher. "
"12301080","12307700"," We got low volume, we're coming in right now."
"12307700","12310620"," So if you're at home trading right now, right, see this low volume down here."
"12312340","12314600"," Here's the initial buyer, see the screen bar right here. "
"12315200","12316540"," Some big boy bought right here."
"12318440","12319520"," Right, we rolled it."
"12320060","12322780"," And probably some big boy in a low volume pump is coming. "
"12323120","12326860"," Some people tell you like, you should see a squeeze higher, that's where the big volume comes in."
"12327460","12331420"," And now you're going to hopefully see a squeeze higher right here in a low volume, low volume pump."
"12331680","12332040"," So we'll see. "
"12333120","12334280"," Just keep grinding in north."
"12335140","12338440"," What if the bill, what if the bulls, what if they, what if you don't get a green bar here?"
"12338860","12342940"," It just kind of grinds into the fucking 130 hour and then we make the decision."
"12343320","12344160"," That'd be kind of funny. "
"12345140","12351120"," You just end up fading it like a just grind up to 130 right back to the opening price."
"12351840","12353400"," And then we get the decision here."
"12353440","12354300"," That'd be fucking awful. "
"12355740","12356140"," Terrible."
"12356700","12357220"," Dealer's man."
"12358220","12359120"," Dealer's not nice. "

"12650330","12651350"," You see this red bar here. "
"12651350","12651690"," Right."
"12652210","12656710"," You want the initial move to go to try to at least reach that R1."
"12657190","12659230"," That might have a failure though above here. "

"12674010","12675710"," 58% retracement."
"12676070","12679750"," So you want to take your profits on the initial move down or up."

"12681410","12683390"," The red and green bar here for the initial moves."
"12683990","12684890"," So we get back."
"12685110","12687570"," So we can head into the one 30 hour you'll see these initial moves. "

"12706510","12706990"," That's what I want."
"12707190","12708930"," So I don't think that I'm going to get this today."
"12709290","12710910"," I don't know why I'm bearish today. "
"12711690","12713290"," Everything's telling me to be bearish here."
"12713470","12716170"," So they've already gone through why I'm bearish."
"12716250","12716970"," You guys already know. "
"12718770","12721170"," You can see trying to break and break trend."
"12721350","12724370"," We're heading back into this short covering type situation here."
"12724370","12729790"," I should have taken this fucking trade down here and held it with diamond hands and I didn't. "
"12729890","12731190"," Coming into VWAP right now."
"12731710","12734530"," So I'm pretty pissed off that they didn't hold that trade."
"12734730","12736070"," I want to see what those calls are now. "
"12736770","12738810"," Now $1.60 fucking three."
"12739110","12742250"," So if you took that trade and you diamond hand that shit, congratulations to you."
"12742590","12746610"," As a matter of fact, we talked about the short covering into the one 30 hour. "
"12746730","12747890"," And that's exactly what's happening."
"12749050","12750770"," That's exactly what's happening here."
"12750790","12752030"," So we are green barning it up. "
"12752570","12757550"," I'm going to bring up a book map for you here on the left hand side so we can see"
"12757550","12758430"," how the move is going."
"12758750","12763990"," You can see the support support of how support of the market is coming into this or into this"
"12763990","12765150"," Brookings Institute."
"12765770","12766890"," Here's your pivot point. "
"12767650","12772750"," I'm going to show you the green bar and the red bar above and below so you can see on"
"12772750","12774910"," a smaller time frame what I'm talking about here."
"12775490","12776910"," That's our there's the gap."
"12777190","12780530"," There's s2 s3 right there. "
"12781570","12785530"," So this should this should be a good a good place for you to decide on what you're going to"
"12785530","12788170"," be taken currently heading into the one 30 hour."
"12788330","12789390"," We are looking short."
"12789630","12791250"," We have a big short covering going on right now. "
"12791690","12794750"," We have still have more sellers than buyers in the market."
"12795490","12797970"," Now this is to be expected into these events."
"12798790","12803970"," You're going to get some kind of short covering heading into the heading into an event like this"
"12803970","12806490"," right a momentarily reprieve here. "
"12806490","12811170"," Likely you'll see us come back on these events right to pivot just before the event."
"12811410","12818390"," So if you are long those calls still you would want to take some profit right around that 395 29."
"12819910","12825090"," And then close close out for a profit and then reenter with some of your winnings so that you"
"12825090","12828570"," eventually have or you overall have a winning day regardless of which way we trade. "
"12829450","12835000"," If you feel free to in the comments section to talk about if you're bearish."
"12835320","12837420"," We think the initial move up is down then up."
"12838000","12842020"," My guest is going to be my guest is going to be that the initial move is going to be"
"12842020","12842300"," higher. "
"12843100","12844500"," And he's going to get bearish."
"12845600","12848300"," He's going to get hot guess we're going to get a we're going to get a dump."
"12849100","12849780"," That's my take. "
"12855310","12857950"," Yeah, I got fucked on that trade kind of pissed about it now."
"12858070","12858650"," I should have held it."
"12859310","12860670"," I was self doubting myself. "
"12865000","12867520"," Oh, did he really got to look to see what I was doing."
"12868000","12868560"," It's a."

"12942520","12942980"," This crazy."
"12943460","12947540"," Can't believe we make a spectacle out of this shit because it's not a ball already in the market. "

"12952600","12957260"," I guarantee you no matter what we do, not guarantee I'm going to give a pretty fair chance to."
"12957620","12964200"," If we do break lower today, you'll see non farm payroll be used to bring us higher. "
"12964200","12970500"," If we trade higher, non farm payroll will more than likely be used to bring us back into where the"
"12970500","12971840"," banks want to close out."
"12972680","12973120"," Opax."
"12975220","12976340"," Too fucking funny. "

"12980580","12982300"," We'll just do S3 for right now."
"12982440","12984700"," We'll start with just the R3 S3. "
"12985660","12987420"," We'll see how we go into this into this event."
"12989920","12993020"," Thanks for saying something, Mr. unrealized profits."
"12995020","12997060"," I'm not usually like right now. "
"12997080","12998200"," I'm not trusting my take."
"12998680","12999780"," My bearishness."
"12999960","13003880"," I shouldn't be this bearish and I am super fucking bearish in this fucking event. "
"13005260","13006560"," I got to be honest with you guys."
"13006720","13010620"," I'm never going to lie to you guys about fucking from bearish or bullish or."
"13012080","13012940"," Into an event. "
"13013300","13014480"," So this looks bullish."
"13014480","13017760"," Right now it is right now looks like we're going to blast the fuck off."
"13019100","13022120"," The setup is the same to blast off like we did the last time. "
"13023580","13024980"," The violent rip higher."
"13025480","13031420"," So it's definitely going against what my fucking psyche is telling me."
"13039710","13045210"," My localized bearishness is is not what's happening right now. "
"13045210","13052970"," Oh, yeah."
"13055510","13057130"," Yeah, I know it's that's abnormal, right?"
"13057310","13057810"," This is not normally."
"13059610","13061850"," Normally it'd be super bullish right now and confident. "
"13063290","13064750"," I'm confident in this right here."
"13064850","13068770"," We talked about we've been talking about this move all morning about shorts closing out."
"13068890","13069770"," This is short covering. "
"13069930","13071110"," That's all this is right now."
"13072950","13076830"," So unless there's a leak of the presser or something like that."
"13080730","13083970"," I'm going to turn the volume up on the news so we can listen to the news. "
"13088180","13090520"," Cook's coming out fucking all bearish right now."
"13091100","13093420"," Current economic period is extremely uncertain."
"13097220","13098140"," That's cooked me. "
"13098220","13101320"," Listen, there's no reason to believe the current version is predictive power."
"13101540","13102060"," I agree with that."
"13103400","13106300"," The Fed does not have an internal definition of a recession. "
"13106820","13107040"," What?"
"13108920","13110100"," The fucking Christ."

"13229890","13230730"," Whichever way we go."
"13230750","13232450"," You're going to see an initial move, right?"
"13232750","13234130"," Then you're going to see a ball crush."
"13235070","13239610"," And you don't want to be like holding calls holding puts for longer than the. "
"13239930","13242370"," Then the implied move or the move that you're taking it for."
"13242510","13242670"," Right."

"13246230","13247310"," You want to take the money and run."
"13247310","13250050"," Because you're northern likely you'll see the event ball roll off."
"13250290","13253270"," You'll see the market pullback and then you'll see another move higher. "
"13253910","13255410"," With re pricing on options."
"13255910","13258030"," Same thing if we start bloodbath that down."
"13259230","13260530"," More than likely going to be. "
"13261230","13262110"," Stop short."
"13263810","13265510"," It'll stop short of major."
"13266610","13267030"," Right. "

"13283330","13285730"," The calls go up 300% come back down. "
"13286530","13289430"," They fucking never go back up to that three or 400% again."
"13290070","13292430"," You'd be lucky if they go up 60, 70%."
"13292430","13294610"," Not always, but a lot of times. "

"13302130","13303370"," Safe is trade you can take."

"13304890","13305790"," It's just trade you can take."
"13306410","13308150"," Best trade is to wait until after the event."
"13310710","13315550"," When trend trend is re decided and then actually best trades probably in December. "
"13316550","13317870"," December third or something."
"13318670","13319470"," Second or third."
"13320670","13321430"," That's the good trade. "

"13414790","13415690"," Jay Paus."
"13416990","13420010"," Hopefully statements is released before we start speaking."
"13420830","13421470"," Excuse me. "
"13421630","13422930"," So the statement is released first."
"13423930","13425570"," I'm going to expect that move higher."
"13427250","13430170"," And then if we prepared marks and then if he. "
"13431350","13432390"," Starts getting bearish."
"13433330","13438810"," It says there's no comparison between the current housing sector and the 2008 crisis."
"13439870","13441990"," Let me turn that counter back on here. "
"13446790","13452590"," So I'm a spokesperson says the RFC scope for further gradual recalibration of China's zero covered"
"13452590","13457310"," policy brings us now to 10 minutes away from the bottom of the hour where we are expecting to hear"
"13457310","13462710"," comments from feds chair pal as he discusses the economic outlook and the labor market at an event"
"13462710","13464170"," hosted by Brookings institution."
"13464170","13469670"," So there is a text to be released from power at the bottom of the hour as well as a"
"13469670","13472150"," Q&A taking place after his keynote speech."
"13472750","13477690"," We have posted out both the live video and the registration link to the power speaking. "
"13481150","13484250"," All right, I'll throw some calls on 390 say."
"13484390","13484570"," Okay."
"13493510","13494910"," I'm going to get torched here. "
"13496210","13500770"," That's power revised registration link has been posted on the feed for those who prefer to"
"13500770","13503930"," officially register to the Brookings Institute event."
"13506050","13507670"," Take a look at book map real quick."
"13508630","13510870"," Look at that nice rug pull opportunity here. "
"13510870","13516220"," You can see anything lower on book map."
"13521720","13523140"," We'll look at that down there."
"13523320","13524740"," Look at this standing order down here. "
"13525400","13526600"," That's 3800."
"13527080","13528140"," You see that one?"
"13529420","13529940"," 3800."
"13531720","13533220"," Look at that one down there. "
"13534900","13536880"," Got another one at 3860."
"13537760","13541760"," Now the gamma level 3860 likely wouldn't trade below this though."
"13542000","13543960"," There's 3860 unless the floor dropped out. "
"13548600","13550500"," I'm in some calls right now if you want to know."
"13554640","13558440"," Hopefully you can get an initial reaction up and not a straight red bar to hell."
"13575430","13578870"," Yeah, it's about where that's about the chart right now. "
"13579210","13584230"," So that where we're at right now, you'll see you should see some liquidity into the event next few"
"13584230","13584430"," minutes."
"13584430","13590470"," You'll see on the right hand side of book map in between the order book and the balls and stuff."
"13590710","13593550"," You'll see liquidity just dry up on both sides up and down. "
"13594950","13598930"," Then once the once the information starts getting dropped, you'll start to see liquidity come back"
"13598930","13599330"," to the market."
"13600110","13601350"," That's on both sides up and down."
"13623720","13625660"," Yeah, yesterday's fan and print was at 382. "
"13625860","13628380"," There's a there's a standing order down there."
"13630340","13632480"," I would I'd like to buy a dip down there be nice."
"13633860","13636580"," I'd like to see a really like to see the market sell off. "
"13638160","13641500"," I think if you're a real bull, you want to see it sell off anyways too, right?"
"13641640","13642800"," Let's get a break breather."
"13643380","13644600"," I'm going to get a breather on the VIX."
"13645900","13647720"," You want to get you want to get some breathers, man. "
"13647920","13649900"," You want to get some nice buy areas on bonds."
"13651160","13653140"," You want to see like the buyer step in and bonds."
"13653140","13654920"," You want to see the VIX go up a little bit. "
"13655820","13661560"," I don't know how you have the bull case without VIX spiking a little bit."
"13665780","13668280"," I think the move is down once he gets out there."
"13671600","13673040"," I think the move is down. "
"13673480","13675100"," I think especially for the bull case."
"13675240","13678340"," If you want a bull case, you need the market to cool off a bit."
"13679440","13679980"," A little bit more. "
"13682020","13685400"," I think that's ultimately the bull case is that you want to see a sell off here."
"13687200","13689940"," You want to dip to buy that you can be confident in."
"13693930","13695490"," It'd be a beautiful run too, right?"
"13695630","13699770"," If you had like a 386 or a 383, you'd buy that dip. "
"13701670","13708610"," Maybe it hits 383 trades back up to like 390 trades sideways and down until like the beginning of"
"13708610","13708850"," December."
"13709490","13710990"," You buy that dip, you trade it up to 410."
"13712090","13712190"," It's easy. "
"13713950","13714750"," Easy as pie."
"13726620","13730860"," I'm going to put a stop loss on my fucking calls here at like fucking 80 cents."
"13731320","13732320"," 70 cents. "
"13733580","13739600"," I've got some stops on some calls."
"13741720","13744400"," Be aware as we watch my cursor here."
"13745720","13747940"," Have some defined loss in here if you're long. "
"13748560","13750080"," You can use this as a bear too, right?"
"13751680","13756040"," Another point to make here is- They're loving it's way now to the Boltzmann Thea where we are"
"13756040","13761580"," expecting the keynote speech from FedsPow as he discusses economic outlook and for labor markets at"
"13761580","13763200"," an event hosted by Brookings."

"13777960","13779720"," I'm sure which will be faster just yet."
"13780420","13782220"," So if we sell off right here, right?"
"13782560","13784260"," And your stops don't trigger. "
"13784260","13786600"," And you don't panic sell down here."
"13786760","13794420"," Usually you'll see a- Usually you'll see a- Usually you'll see is a retracement rate bounce back up"
"13794420","13796060"," a failure here and then back down again."
"13796660","13800040"," You'd want let's say they cost you a dollar and then they come back up. "
"13800160","13804780"," You can grab 70 cents off until you least unbuck yourself from this trade right here if it goes the"
"13804780","13805160"," wrong way."
"13805580","13808260"," So you have to manage the trades if they go against you."
"13808760","13810940"," Manage the trades if your stops don't fill. "
"13822590","13826350"," I'm going to remove this now so that we're coming into the- into the- into the- into"
"13826350","13826690"," the hour."
"13836780","13839680"," We're starting to see the low liquidity in the market now, right?"
"13839860","13840100"," The orders."
"13840640","13847220"," And I've seen a lot of buyers or sellers waiting for a decision or a meeting or notes or whatever. "
"13848280","13851840"," We'll listen closely to the news here and turn the volume up on it."
"13852480","13854000"," So you can hear what they're saying."

"14044900","14046020"," It's the first time that this guy talked, okay?"
"14049600","14051200"," I just, I just, yep."
"14051660","14052300"," I just got to stop. "
"14052320","14056440"," This balance says price stability is the fair's responsibility and bedrock of the economy."
"14056640","14057320"," It's got to stop down."
"14057460","14058700"," On a race of rate hikes. "
"14059060","14061180"," How makes sense to moderate a pace of rate hikes."
"14061820","14064340"," Likely you need to hold policy at restrictive level for some time."
"14064760","14069580"," It seems to me likely that rates must ultimately go somewhere higher than policymakers thought in"
"14069580","14070280"," September. "
"14070280","14075160"," It says we have made substantial progress toward a sufficiently restrictive policy and have more"
"14075160","14075840"," ground to cover."
"14076140","14079560"," Noticing upside movement in the S&P 500 downside movement in the dollar here."
"14079920","14084260"," Feds power says time to moderate the pace of rate hikes may come as soon as the December meeting. "
"14084760","14086760"," This inflation remains far too high."
"14087200","14089420"," It says we will stay the course until the job is done."
"14089860","14092000"," It says we have a long way to go in restoring price stability. "
"14092620","14097900"," History cautions strongly against prematurely loosening policy growth and economic activity has"
"14097900","14101540"," slowed to well below a longer run trend and this needs to be sustained."
"14102100","14104040"," It's a path ahead for inflation highly uncertain."
"14104760","14108360"," We estimate PCE price index rose 6% in 12 months through October. "
"14109060","14110520"," Core PCE rose 5%."
"14110920","14113440"," Note October inflation data was a welcome surprise."
"14113900","14117440"," We'll take substantially more evidence to give comfort that inflation is actually declining. "
"14118080","14122140"," Have so far seen only tentative signs of moderation in labor demand and wage growth."
"14122660","14126280"," Expect housing services inflation to begin falling sometime next year."
"14126280","14129760"," If right here start taking some profit while too early to declare good inflation. "
"14129900","14131800"," Then start for the next level up."
"14131800","14137040"," It's going to be R1, R2, 399, 29 with pressure on overall inflation in the coming months."
"14137640","14141800"," Moderation in labor demand growth that will be required to restore labor market balance. "
"14142260","14145440"," So just to repeat some comments that Feds power made there."
"14147560","14149140"," We got R1 tag below."
"14149320","14153200"," You're going to want to see if this route, if we come back here right and then make another trip"
"14153200","14154040"," higher to R2. "
"14154040","14156700"," This is a place to monetize your calls right now."
"14156700","14158860"," To moderate the pace of rate increases."
"14159380","14162780"," We can still go up to R2 here, but I want you to remember that they're going to reprice at"
"14162780","14163660"," this point right now. "
"14163760","14163920"," Okay."
"14166700","14169120"," You're going to see a re-pricing event at some point in here."
"14169160","14170040"," I'm going to show you guys this. "
"14171380","14171780"," Thanks."
"14171920","14172120"," I hear."
"14175650","14181110"," So again, looking to the markets here, S&P 500 did see some moving towards the upside past four,"
"14181110","14182590"," four percent on the session at the moment. "
"14182590","14185610"," So let it see some downside movement following that as well."
"14185770","14186830"," We're rocket ship, baby."
"14187050","14187390"," That's pal. "
"14189010","14190090"," We're rocket ship."
"14190970","14192270"," Slam into R1."
"14192670","14193570"," Take your money here. "
"14193810","14194610"," It's going to come back down."
"14194950","14195690"," They're going to re-pricing this."
"14195790","14197170"," You want to take another one?"
"14197490","14201210"," You can and lower prices to see some upside movement on stocks from the back of this. "
"14204510","14205390"," Hello, ladies."
"14208630","14211350"," Option price has already come back right down right now."
"14211910","14221090"," We're watching the options chain right now. "
"14221190","14221930"," You're seeing that initial."
"14222150","14223990"," Hopefully you took profit at R1, right?"
"14225070","14226430"," You see this R1 above, right?"
"14226570","14228370"," Take your initial money out."

"14400540","14404160"," His comments are consistent with an end to 75 basis point rate rises."

"14451240","14452680"," Particularly in interest incentives such as housing."
"14453200","14456240"," So we can say that the demand growth is slowed and we expect this growth will need to remain at"

"21530070","21531070"," How are you not here for this moment?"
"21531950","21535690"," Probably my core followers are in this room right now with me."
"21536790","21538590"," If you're in here right now, I love you. "
"21540010","21540530"," Congratulations."
"21542510","21544390"," 406 19 now."
"21545130","21547030"," Give me a pen strike up there. "
"21549190","21550670"," We trade to the end."
"21552290","21554730"," We trade to the end every day."
"21560500","21561480"," Smash it up higher. "
"21561840","21562960"," 406 26."
"21564680","21566160"," 406 27."
"21567720","21569180"," Now I get the Tesla thing. "
"21569320","21571860"," I gave my view point on the Tesla trade."
"21572380","21573860"," I wouldn't have taken that trade for a minute."
"21574180","21578280"," I would have taken the NQ trade though or a Tesla trade after the announcement you take the trade. "
"21578380","21578960"," That's what I said."
"21579720","21582240"," There's no reason to enter that trade early ever."
"21583080","21585040"," You'll lose seven out of 10 times guaranteed. "
"21586200","21589660"," As a matter of fact, this trade right here today was better to take after the talk."
"21591560","21592220"," Hands down."
"21592700","21594280"," You're you're the right side on that trade. "
"21594900","21596500"," 406 35 now."
"21596680","21597220"," Watch out here."
"21599040","21599980"," Be careful here. "
"21600080","21600660"," We're coming to some resistance."
"21600840","21603720"," If you're long right now, you're going to be looking for I want you to know we're going to have"
"21603720","21604520"," a swift reversal."
"21605200","21609180"," Now that we're melting up, you're going to get a slam down here at some point. "
"21609860","21611560"," So be conscious of that as we head here."
"21611980","21614080"," Be very, very careful as we head up."
"21614200","21615540"," Take some money off the table if you're long. "
"21619150","21619830"," Hell no."
"21620510","21625130"," Guys, any of you fucking guys out there that are like, well, I'm going to fucking point my finger"
"21625130","21629230"," and not wait for not wait for whatever the fucking decision is."
"21629610","21634050"," The key here is that a lot of people don't know how to interpret the decision before the move is"
"21634050","21634350"," made. "
"21635230","21638050"," We get the decision right every time I know which way to go."
"21638210","21638770"," Look at that move."
"21639450","21641350"," Look at that monster stretched out move. "
"21642610","21643710"," Look at that destruction."
"21644910","21646050"," Just killing it."
"21648610","21649250"," Tilling it. "
"21651130","21652890"," Look at that grind up into the bell."
"21653050","21654130"," They're not even waiting for afterwards."
"21654590","21656470"," Can you imagine that the gap it's going to be?"
"21656790","21661390"," There might be a kick ass trade at like, maybe a kick ass trade from four o'clock to four"
"21661390","21661750"," fifteen. "
"21662850","21666050"," It's so illiquid that you might just see us green bars straight up."
"21669040","21673720"," The overwhelming buyers with no sellers in the after hours, we could just start green barring after"
"21673720","21674020"," the bell."
"21677250","21677690"," Possibility. "
"21680010","21680450"," 40653."
"21681630","21685970"," Even if we bounce off up here into the bell, if there is a bounce off of the bell, I'd"
"21685970","21688730"," be interested in a trade from four o'clock to four fifteen in there."
"21691730","21692670"," Just gangster. "
"21693090","21693930"," Gangster in it up."
"21696710","21699430"," You guys always need to be taking high probability trades."
"21701590","21702510"," Trade the reaction. "
"21702790","21703950"," We talked about that today, right?"
"21704270","21704770"," Trade the reaction."
"21705090","21705610"," Trade the after."
"21705610","21707890"," Trade the fucking message that's gets sent out. "
"21708090","21709450"," Be able to interpret the message."
"21716510","21718930"," You bought 407s for four cents."
"21719150","21721390"," Yeah, they were like five cents earlier today, right?"
"21722050","21723890"," They were like five cents this morning. "
"21724450","21725690"," I think we looked at those this morning."
"21726190","21728770"," They're like five fucking pennies."
"21729970","21734570"," Yeah, I think 404s were five pennies at one point. "
"21738290","21740710"," I'll like five cents on these fucking fours."
"21740890","21744010"," I think there were 404s and I was like, there's no, they don't know fucking printing those."
"21744710","21747850"," They're now $1.90. They were at like two something. "
"21749990","21752130"," I bought them for 40 cents a little while ago."
"21757420","21759060"," Yeah, look at a little bit of sell-off here."
"21760020","21762820"," Hopefully you took some profit on this pin strike up above here. "
"21765180","21768620"," We'll see if we can, we'll do another, we'll do another little fence to here."
"21768840","21769760"," See how deep it goes."
"21770780","21772460"," Move it on up for the next one. "
"21773940","21777100"," See if we can consolidate and get this nice little strike into the bell."
"21777940","21779800"," See if we can do one more push up here."
"21779920","21780440"," We'll see what happens. "
"21781540","21783320"," Stay right to the fucking bitter end."
"21784660","21786000"," Right to the bitter end."
"21791060","21792180"," Can you believe that, Winky?"
"21792380","21793160"," I know people left. "
"21793760","21796300"," I know that half these viewers just walked away into the trades over."
"21797360","21798440"," I know they did."
"21805500","21812040"," So the 404 or 394s were a dollar. "
"21812280","21813040"," Those are $1,100."
"21813160","21815020"," That's a $1,100 percent gain in that trade."
"21817100","21821380"," $1,200 gain, 394s. "
"21833410","21834830"," Right on Stunk's Anonymous."
"21853140","21854420"," Well, you guys can't see this."
"21855680","21857200"," I want to make sure you guys can see this. "
"21866030","21866430"," Unreal."
"21871140","21873100"," Yeah, we're still, there's still buyers here."
"21874500","21875980"," So there's some supply up here. "
"21876140","21878460"," We already know that there's supply right up in here, right?"
"21878460","21879380"," So this is supply."
"21880620","21884840"," They're feeding sellers down into these monster buyers, right?"
"21886220","21890300"," The demand though down here is unrelenting."
"21891140","21895220"," This demand that's down here is, cancels all this bullshit out. "
"21897220","21898900"," We'll see if we get the grind and the close."
"21901300","21902920"," Just the push, the push, push."
"21905840","21906700"," Up into the bell. "
"21909980","21911000"," Congratulations to bulls."
"21913220","21913800"," It's funny."
"21913940","21914960"," People are calling me a bear today. "
"21914960","21916940"," I'm like, I'm feeling fucking bearish."
"21917700","21921000"," Past year, I've been screamed at for being a bull because I am a bull."
"21922340","21923180"," I've always been a bull. "
"21923340","21924040"," Always will be a bull."
"21924600","21926280"," So now I'm going to get ragged on for that."
"21926400","21926680"," That's hilarious. "
"21928260","21929900"," Be honest, the same film, bearish."
"21937430","21939310"," Yeah, so I was in calls down."
"21939730","21948850"," So down in here, I was in, so my initial, or not prediction, what I thought was going to happen"
"21948850","21951870"," was I thought we'd get, so I was in calls. "
"21952350","21960020"," I was in calls right here, right?"
"21960620","21966460"," We dipped and it triggered my, I didn't have a stop, and then I added a stop."
"21966680","21966960"," It triggered."
"21968120","21974140"," So then I had to buy back in for this move here, and then I ended up, this one right"
"21974140","21975540"," here ended up buying this move again. "
"21977040","21979860"," They went down a little bit in value, but then they went fucking ballistic."
"21980180","21981500"," I made a bunch of change in that one."
"21982320","21984120"," Took part of that trade, not all of it though. "
"21984240","21989480"," I missed some of this, and I think I bought right here, and I took it right here."
"21990420","21994840"," I have to look at my, I haven't looked at my fucking, I got to take a look at my"
"21994840","21998200"," fucking activity for the day and see how much I've made so far."
"21998540","21999040"," I've done well. "
"21999940","22007560"," And one of these moves, I made 400% in a trade, so that's going to pay for the fucking"
"22007560","22008340"," s-dow bullshit."
"22008880","22011260"," And I'm going to stay, I'm fucking staying in that s-dow shit."
"22012020","22014240"," Who the fuck did I don't get fucked in that trade?"
"22019380","22021080"," Now this trade just continues on. "
"22021380","22023020"," It'll likely continue on right into the bell."
"22024840","22029440"," There might be a trade at 4 to 4.15 too, but you guys can't see this shit."
"22030100","22031460"," You guys can't see it behind book map. "
"22032460","22036320"," I was going to show you where I got, where I got stopped out of the initial trade I got"
"22036320","22041560"," stopped out of, but my take on the day was going to be, or my initial take on this was"
"22041560","22043480"," that, you get the green bar rep, right?"
"22044120","22045760"," Remember how small this looked earlier today?"
"22046160","22047080"," Just took up the whole screen."
"22048220","22049560"," You guys forget shit, man."
"22049940","22057280"," Like let's look at a, so earlier today, the initial move up, we actually tagged that initial move"
"22057280","22057540"," up. "
"22059880","22061460"," Let me mute this over here."
"22064780","22065480"," Go on here."
"22067020","22071780"," So if you remember, if you guys remember earlier, we had this red and green bar right here, right?"
"22072180","22073600"," We're right in the middle of it, right?"
"22073860","22075540"," Right in the point of control is the point right there. "
"22076420","22080980"," We had an initial move down, and I was trading this long here, and I was looking for J-Pow"
"22080980","22084280"," to get bearish, and then depth of hell it."
"22085080","22090220"," And we turned on J-Pow and he started speaking, and I'm like, we were like right away, right back"
"22090220","22093180"," in the stream, and we were like right here, and I'm like, shit."
"22094780","22097740"," I'm like, this guy, but we were consolidating right here. "
"22099340","22105000"," We're consolidating right here, and I'm like, this fucking guy just did a policy change, and all of"
"22105000","22108400"," a sudden we went, whoom, whoom, and just started ripping."
"22110400","22115180"," And then you keep listening, and every one of those, every one of that, that's speaking, this was"
"22115180","22117900"," like the, this was like policy shift change, we ripped higher."
"22118760","22123940"," This is when he started to take some questions, and he just turned full bull, and it was off and"
"22123940","22124120"," running. "
"22124740","22130820"," And once we were off and running like this, full straight melt up, bam, bam, and now bam up here."
"22134650","22137470"," It doesn't want to crash the market, unreal."
"22140680","22141820"," It's gonna make cool tape to watch. "
"22143020","22148530"," It's gonna make cool, it's gonna make cool cool thing to look back at."
"22150950","22153070"," This is one that I'm gonna put in the vault."
"22156870","22157230"," Unreal. "
"22165040","22167160"," I'm gonna put the book mat back on so you guys are saying."
"22169640","22172900"," I'm not good chaser, not bear, but you know when to put on the bull."
"22173080","22175300"," So yeah, oblivious to saying the exact thing. "
"22175660","22179020"," I'm a bull, and this is the most bearish I've felt in a long time."
"22179020","22181000"," And I told everyone that was on stream."
"22181740","22187460"," I even went and told Jedi Marcus like, hold me, hold me, hold me because I shouldn't be feeling"
"22187460","22188080"," this right now. "
"22189380","22193500"," I've been up for three days trying to figure all this shit out, but you have to be able to"
"22193500","22194980"," switch, switch whenever you need to."
"22195560","22196600"," And this was the pivot."
"22196960","22200720"," So I want you to know this, that this was right here. "
"22201140","22206260"," We have this on stream, you can go back and watch it right down here, right here."
"22207720","22211940"," This is where Jay Powell mentioned like four or five points."
"22212380","22213700"," This is where he changed his tune. "
"22213980","22216400"," And as soon as he did, we rocket shipped."
"22217380","22221680"," And then in here with this consolidation, this is where he was being asked questions."
"22222680","22228440"," And once it was like full board, he's on board, that was it, straight melt up, a couple little"
"22228440","22230120"," stops, but you know, that was it. "
"22230280","22230820"," We're gonna do this."
"22231860","22236800"," This is reverberating right now, uh, everywhere around the world right now."
"22238940","22243060"," Might assume with people with large, large, large pockets, they're just buying. "
"22249710","22251950"," But the dollar drop percent should be by now."
"22252710","22253670"," How does he do that?"
"22254090","22255590"," It seems like he makes it worse."
"22256390","22257210"," No, not really Kobe. "
"22257530","22261510"," You gotta like, so you do do diligence before and you're looking for keywords and shit that they"
"22261510","22269350"," say, you know, you're not looking for Twitter to tell you what the what it means."
"22270410","22272150"," You're looking to be in the right side of the trade."
"22272870","22273990"," And you should always be reacting. "
"22274610","22277910"," Anyone that's out there that's like, Oh, I called the, I called that we're going straight up today."
"22278370","22279870"," I diamond headed into the clothes today."
"22280390","22281790"," Those people are, they come and they go. "
"22282050","22284150"," You have to wait, you have to learn what to look for."
"22284510","22288030"," And then you want to jump on the trade or the reactive trade afterwards."
"22288730","22289990"," You don't want to, you'll get blown up. "
"22290170","22293470"," I fucking blown up six figure accounts doing that stupid shit."
"22294450","22298070"," Fucking, I've blown up multiple six figure accounts doing that shit."
"22299390","22300330"," That shit doesn't work. "
"22301030","22301990"," 100% of that."
"22303170","22308650"," You always want to wait and see and know what to be listening for when news breaks."
"22309070","22309430"," What does it mean?"
"22309750","22310630"," How's the market going to react?"
"22311730","22312090"," Always. "
"22312750","22313990"," You guys have to learn that shit."
"22318770","22320030"," No, I think we're tagged."
"22320430","22322970"," I don't, I don't give a fine fuck about moving averages right now. "
"22323770","22325010"," Moving averages can suck my dick."
"22325410","22328050"," The only thing, the only thing that I should have said that should I have to delete that."
"22328790","22330230"," You don't think that that matters, right?"
"22330450","22331970"," You don't matters in a moving average right now?"
"22332710","22333630"," Dixie in the 200. "
"22334650","22335810"," That's what matters right now."
"22336450","22337850"," It's the only thing that matters right now."
"22341250","22342650"," It's the only thing that matters right now. "
"22345750","22346170"," Good."
"22346330","22347470"," Let them fuel the rocket ship up."
"22350330","22351890"," Yeah, it's good to have you guys here. "
"22352330","22354070"," Some of you guys are in this chat right now."
"22354710","22355850"," Read everything I post."
"22356630","22358430"," You come in the morning at 9 30. "
"22358970","22360990"," You stay on stream with me all day long."
"22361870","22368410"," So if you, if you come in like here and there or if you're new or if you're, you pop"
"22368410","22370150"," in and out, you don't get the full story."
"22370210","22371210"," So you, it's hard. "
"22371510","22373870"," But there's a core group of you that are there at 24 hours a day."
"22374270","22378670"," Last night at fucking three o'clock in the morning, I was out, I was out doing test streams at"
"22378670","22381030"," three o'clock in the morning, three o'clock in the morning last night."
"22381590","22383850"," And I had people on Twitter going, what the fuck are you doing?"
"22384610","22388710"," And I didn't realize I was posting these streams to a, that happens often. "
"22388710","22393030"," That's like the due diligence that I do in the background when you guys, when I'm not on live."
"22393750","22397010"," So this is what they eat, shit, and sleep this stuff all day, every day."
"22398690","22402550"," So I appreciate the one, I appreciate all the other, I appreciate the ones that are there through"
"22402550","22405850"," watching the process as to how you make money. "
"22410950","22416210"," Yeah, you got to read the context post too."
"22418170","22420810"," So this morning, the context post was critical."
"22422430","22427150"," And it's the key to even today, the key to what we're looking for from the Fed today. "
"22427690","22428530"," Do they keep lying?"
"22429430","22430670"," How long can they keep lying?"
"22432010","22432010"," Right?"
"22432450","22433510"," That was the key about today."
"22434070","22437430"," Key today was the narrative, right?"
"22438570","22439470"," That was the key."
"22440230","22442150"," This morning's post was about the narrative. "
"22442490","22444910"," How long can they keep this bullshit narrative up?"
"22445690","22447430"," How long until we find out?"
"22448070","22449590"," Is it the minutes from the December meeting?"
"22450270","22451690"," Is it the minutes from the January meeting?"
"22452150","22453310"," Is it the minutes from the March meeting?"
"22454070","22455310"," We all know what they're doing."
"22456410","22461650"," So, and then of course, this morning I said to you, well, that's the first option is the least"
"22461650","22462150"," probable."
"22462830","22466330"," And that's where where Jerome tells you the truth. "
"22466990","22469890"," And if Jerome does tell you the truth, this is where we're going."
"22470890","22472010"," Way the fuck up."
"22474270","22474970"," Completely improbable. "
"22475750","22477570"," That's the first thing that came out of his fucking mouth."
"22477950","22481050"," It took like three minutes or five minutes for him to say those words."
"22482110","22489050"," It is basically like your girlfriend cheated on you and you confront her and you're going to say to"
"22489050","22492270"," her, or in your mind, you're going, she's going to fucking deny it. "
"22493190","22495150"," She's going to fucking use all these excuses."
"22496490","22497290"," Oh, there we go."
"22497510","22498810"," Four, six, fifty nine, baby. "
"22499250","22503630"," Just the monkey wrench, the big giant green dildos, the roof."
"22504450","22507750"," You know, you're so you got the plan for when you got to confront her, right?"
"22508630","22509610"," So you confront her."
"22510330","22512330"," And she doesn't lie to you says to you, you know what?"
"22512450","22512850"," I love you. "
"22513210","22513830"," I fucked up."
"22514490","22515570"," I was cheating on you."
"22515770","22516770"," I did this and I did that. "
"22516910","22518190"," I never meant to hurt you and I apologize."
"22518950","22520030"," You should leave me today."
"22520330","22521770"," You deserve better than me. "
"22522190","22523350"," That's what he did today."
"22523570","22525190"," Now, of course, it's a fucking Ponzi scheme."
"22525830","22527030"," That's what he did today. "
"22529450","22533350"," He didn't because you saw the Fed speakers last week pull the bullshit."
"22537150","22538130"," Oh, baby."
"22538550","22542730"," M O C three four point five billion by side, Troy, Corp. "
"22543130","22543910"," What up, brother?"
"22544610","22547070"," Plant it in the clothes four, six, seventy."
"22548010","22549290"," Just gangster."
"22549510","22552610"," Look at that up there way up in the sky. "
"22553910","22558750"," So, you know, so this morning, I got this fever post that I make."
"22558770","22561250"," It's like eight pages long, nine pages long."
"22562170","22565130"," Even in the ninth page that there's nine pages here. "
"22565190","22567570"," Read them all because it's important for you to see."
"22569050","22575210"," It's important for you to see that or what he says today because he's only going to they go quiet"
"22575210","22576110"," for the meeting, right?"
"22576310","22579710"," The only time you're going to get the truth, almost like an earnings report is like an earnings"
"22579710","22580250"," report, right?"
"22580690","22581930"," You're going to get the truth in the minutes."
"22583170","22587670"," And you remember, he's promised that the Senate, I even started off saying he promised the Senate. "
"22587690","22588810"," Now he's only talking to us."
"22589170","22593570"," He's not talking to Jim Bob and Bob Billy Bob and Mike Bob and Mary Bob and all those other"
"22593570","22593890"," people."
"22594310","22597730"," So, is he going to fucking keep lying to us and how long can he keep lying to us?"
"22598790","22599830"," And he didn't. "
"22600910","22602350"," He fucking didn't."
"22602470","22603930"," He fucking told the truth."
"22605850","22607450"," He's like Ponzi scheme back on. "
"22607550","22607830"," Let's go."
"22610110","22614190"," And then when he was being interviewed, he's like, I don't want to crash the market."
"22614510","22615490"," He's like, I'm behind the market. "
"22615610","22616130"," I love the market."
"22616410","22619430"," Market's my friend, but buddy, I love it."
"22623710","22626170"," And that's when you started getting the fucking melt up. "
"22626170","22630490"," Look at those giant green bars down there."
"22630930","22632350"," Look at these things over here."
"22635120","22636400"," Wait till the market closes. "
"22636800","22639880"," From 4 to 4.15, I want to see if it just green bars it up."
"22641540","22642560"," What do we got up here?"
"22642720","22643220"," What's up here?"
"22644880","22645240"," 40551."
"22645520","22646300"," What else we got up here?"
"22649120","22649840"," 40770, 40774. "
"22650420","22651800"," We're going to do the creepy crawling to the close."
"22652620","22654820"," Just smashing and bashing into the bell."
"22655320","22659680"," You got all kinds of, you got guys on the Bahamas on a yacht right now, right?"
"22660160","22663740"," Calling their brokers and saying, buy this fucking market right now. "
"22664400","22665720"," I have cash to deploy."
"22666000","22667100"," I don't care if we have another bounce."
"22667600","22668700"," I don't care what the bounce is. "
"22669440","22673240"," I don't care if it comes back and retests even 350 by the market."
"22674200","22675380"," I made it for the next three years."
"22675440","22675760"," Let's go. "
"22676380","22676920"," Let's do it."
"22677640","22679620"," That's what they're doing right now."
"22686920","22687820"," That's right, Chen. "
"22691530","22694910"," Of course, my expectation today is I'm like, well, he's probably going to come out."
"22695590","22700750"," He's probably going to come out right and he's going to be, you know, it's not going to be hawkish."
"22702490","22705310"," But then he's going to get hawkish later on. "
"22705470","22708470"," He's going to fucking put on the bear suit and smash the market down."
"22708710","22709750"," And he didn't, dude."
"22709870","22710890"," He just kept fucking going. "
"22711470","22712790"," So we have a policy shift."
"22712790","22713510"," We said that earlier."
"22713730","22714910"," I think we said it right at like 135. "
"22716250","22717490"," This is a policy shift."
"22720390","22724410"," We're having a like 135 145 or something before we even started skyrocketing."
"22725270","22727150"," I told you guys, we have a policy shift. "
"22727990","22729530"," I hope you know, I'll cut it out and replay it."
"22729630","22730630"," I'll post it on Twitter somewhere."
"22731530","22737910"," I want you to tell me that somebody else is called that at 135 or 140 or whatever. "
"22738070","22738910"," I guarantee nobody did."
"22739550","22740530"," Maybe a few."
"22741230","22744810"," A few that knew there was a policy shift, but not many did. "
"22745310","22746550"," Unless you're a professional."
"22747110","22749070"," Professionals probably fucking new right away."
"22749550","22750370"," Off fuck were fucked. "
"22751190","22754070"," Look at these green giant volume bars into the bell."
"22754750","22760050"," Just melt up classic now at 406.84. Just huge moves into the bell."
"22760770","22761570"," Get up there. "
"22762550","22763750"," Get up there."
"22763970","22768830"," First, only good news of an entire year of a change right there."
"22769010","22769470"," Look at that. "
"22770910","22775830"," That's what happens when you get the only, only good news for an entire year."
"22777250","22781650"," You get that news at 130 on a Wednesday and you're telling me we're not going to melt up into"
"22781650","22782010"," the clothes?"
"22782610","22783190"," Get out of here."
"22785610","22787770"," We're going green bars into the bell, baby. "
"22793190","22794050"," Thank you, Liam."
"22794050","22796130"," Here we go."
"22796370","22797210"," Right into that clothes. "
"22798310","22801450"," We haven't had a bullish reason to be bullish all year long."
"22801990","22803450"," Can you tell me we're not closing bullish?"
"22805210","22806230"," That's what you're telling me?"
"22807210","22809370"," Tell me all year long up here, right?"
"22809550","22810190"," We've sold this."
"22810850","22813690"," We've, top of the key, we've sold this all year long. "
"22815570","22816410"," All year long."
"22816590","22816910"," Hold on here."
"22818470","22820270"," I'm going to try to tell me all year long. "
"22820470","22821210"," We've sold this, right?"
"22821210","22821810"," Sold it."
"22822250","22822910"," Sold it."
"22824310","22825650"," Hold on. "
"22827570","22829210"," It's a bull celebration day."
"22829350","22830990"," We're going to do some bull celebrating here, okay?"
"22831670","22833870"," We haven't had any fucking celebrating all year long."
"22835390","22837110"," Let me mute my camera. "
"22838510","22839650"," All year long."
"22839870","22840790"," No reason to celebrate."
"22841690","22842270"," All year long. "
"22843410","22845310"," As we come into this close, right, we've sold it."
"22846010","22846790"," We've sold it."
"22847370","22848170"," We've sold it. "
"22848950","22850130"," We've sold it."
"22850130","22851950"," You tell me we're coming into this one."
"22852270","22856570"," We have a policy change right here, and we're going to sell this right now. "
"22857570","22860150"," Not a single extension above all year long."
"22860650","22864570"," You're telling me we're not going to extend and blast, at least blast out here and close some gaps."
"22865270","22865870"," Fuck no. "
"22868290","22869010"," Fuck no."
"22869170","22870970"," We're going to fucking close it strong and hard."
"22871650","22873710"," First time all year long, good news. "
"22874410","22879110"," One day, you get a bear that wants to rain, rain on a bull parade on one day of the"
"22879110","22879910"," entire year."
"22880510","22881310"," Get out of here."
"22883190","22884410"," Let the bull celebrate. "
"22885590","22888110"," Let the bull celebrate a policy change."
"22888110","22893890"," You see it in the volume on the day into this close abs to fucking lutely."
"22893910","22895430"," We're going to close in the on the high. "
"22895970","22899470"," This is what a bull market looks like right here in a microcosm."
"22899850","22901990"," We're at the start of a bull market."
"22902330","22904470"," Read what possibly this is all tentative. "
"22904630","22905630"," I got a bunch of shit."
"22905630","22906710"," I got to check everything."
"22906710","22908610"," I got a detailed check everything they said. "
"22909430","22916310"," I can't trust everything he said, but the markets reaction initially to this point, right, is we're"
"22916310","22917410"," going fucking."
"22917830","22926190"," We're changing direction and to think for a moment that we're not going to try to extend outside of"
"22926190","22930570"," that downward that downward channel for at least a few days, fucking a good bug out here."
"22932550","22933590"," Now, can we pull back?"
"22933790","22936930"," Yeah, we can pull back, but I think the trade is higher and outside. "
"22937410","22941490"," I think you're going to get a break of this downward channel to even if it's like a symbolic or"
"22941490","22942910"," just the volume that's coming in."
"22944110","22945890"," I think you're going to get to move outside of the channel."
"22945910","22946390"," You have to. "
"22947630","22949990"," The move is higher out of the channel."
"22950370","22953750"," You have a reason now to get you have a reason to go higher to check higher."
"22953970","22960190"," You have reason to close gaps above and you're going to get the opportunity as a bull right to for"
"22960190","22964530"," some consolidation above that channel for a move to close the gaps higher. "
"22964890","22969650"," If the move is lower to the depths of hell, they're going to check at least with that policy"
"22969650","22970050"," change."
"22971890","22973190"," 406.93 currently."
"22975970","22976970"," Two minutes left. "
"22977590","22978570"," Can we get it into the bell?"
"22979290","22982230"," The bulls want to know, can I get my cherry on top?"
"22982570","22986430"," 406.93. Can you squeeze it up one more time in the last minute?"
"22987010","22988410"," Can you slap the top of that?"
