"13640","14480"," Let's see if we're up."
"18000","20700"," Okay, I'll turn that so I can see."
"23280","25140"," I've got the feed up right now, right?"
"26280","28700"," Let's see if we can scroll this a little bit higher. "
"29260","30500"," Oh, yeah, maybe 480."
"31619","34240"," Look at the heroin decatur up."
"37000","37880"," Good morning. "
"38780","42560"," I was having some technical difficulties that I was trying to..."
"42560","45960"," Let's see if I can move this over a little bit here."
"45960","47360"," So I can see everything you guys are saying."
"49520","53080"," I was trying to run some new equipment to this morning. "
"53760","54580"," Good morning, y'all."
"54760","55240"," How y'all doing?"
"56140","56760"," Morning, Joey."
"56980","57680"," Good morning, endless research. "
"58840","65140"," Good morning, Damien, Dragon Wolf, Benjamin, Binky, Guacata, HP, Kubrick."
"65680","66200"," Good morning."
"66740","67440"," Morning, Binky. "
"68320","69100"," How y'all doing?"
"70960","73960"," I'm hoping that this is a better setup."
"74640","75440"," I'm almost there."
"75540","75900"," I'm like..."
"75960","76880"," 80% of the way there. "
"78160","79960"," I got a new camera setup this morning."
"81420","88740"," I have a new mic and I have a new computer setup, but I still need to add one more"
"88740","89460"," computer to it."
"89800","91140"," I've got one, two, three, four. "
"91860","101560"," Good morning, Omar, T-Chrone, Alex, Kristoff, Kristoffer, Inlight, Jafar, Ryan, Mateus, John, S, G"
"101560","101900"," Chen."
"102220","103080"," Good morning to all of you."
"104280","105680"," Is this too loud for you guys?"
"105840","106600"," Is the game too much?"
"107940","108980"," Let's see if this is too much. "
"110580","111380"," Check one, two."
"113400","115700"," Good morning, Jasmine, G Chen, CJ."
"116260","117000"," Morning, everybody. "
"118780","120350"," Sorry it's taken so long to get on the..."
"121300","122040"," Yeah, you know what?"
"123040","123980"," I've got two more..."
"123980","130160"," I've got some lights coming in and they were supposed to arrive yesterday and they have not"
"130160","130400"," arrived."
"131000","133160"," So I've got two more lights coming that I'll brighten the room up."
"133900","138320"," I tried to increase the ISO in the camera, but it was like a washout effect. "
"139960","140940"," Good morning, everybody."
"142660","147940"," Got a new camera trying to reconfigure the computers this morning so that I can..."
"147940","149860"," We won't have any lag in the live stream."
"150180","153060"," If you guys are seeing any lag today, let me know. "
"153380","155960"," Good morning, Chaz, Douglas, Lucas."
"156260","156860"," Good morning, GP."
"157580","157900"," Good morning. "
"158780","160120"," Mero, what up, bro?"
"161040","161440"," Chansu."
"161640","162380"," Good to see you too."
"163600","164300"," Yeah, Mero. "
"164420","165560"," They tried to dump that last night."
"165600","166500"," That wasn't happening, right?"
"166700","171180"," There's a little bit of playing around in futures, but not today."
"172240","172640"," Right?"
"172740","174840"," We're noticing that today that there's no..."
"174840","176860"," There's no messing around. "
"178680","179540"," Like I'm pretty proud."
"179760","180380"," Yeah, I got a new..."
"180380","183240"," I got a new lens coming too, so you're gonna get that..."
"183240","185400"," You're gonna get that meat kevin effect at some point."
"186080","188080"," It just won't be as goofy. "
"193300","193700"," Hutch."
"194040","196600"," Yeah, so last yesterday, we can get to that in just a second here."
"196640","198300"," We'll talk about that this morning. "
"199080","200060"," Good morning, you trope."
"202160","203100"," Yeah, you know what?"
"203200","204280"," I can probably get some..."
"204280","205760"," I like the idea of the natural sunshine."
"207020","211160"," I built this studio so that I could control it because they'll be live streaming at different times"
"211160","214080"," of the day, so I've got everything blacked out in this room. "
"215260","217420"," Good morning, BG Tati."
"218080","218880"," Big Tati."
"219220","219840"," Good morning, Josh. "
"220640","222060"," Yeah, I like the natural sunshine."
"222740","226720"," I just can't control it throughout the day, so I'm waiting on a couple sets of lights."
"227040","228120"," They were supposed to be delivered yesterday. "
"228740","233180"," They should arrive by today, and then I'll have the controlled lighting."
"234540","238260"," And then, of course, the camera at ISO 400 is kind of the right..."
"238260","240300"," If I had the right lights here right now, they'd be perfect."
"242320","243600"," I appreciate the concern. "
"243940","245160"," It's gonna be a little bit dark today."
"245560","245720"," It should."
"246500","247980"," The lights will get better tomorrow. "
"249400","252640"," You'll be able to see my face better and all that kind of stuff that you guys can see me"
"252640","253020"," right now."
"255829","257329"," So good morning to all of you out there."
"257390","258050"," Good afternoon, right?"
"258209","259190"," It's 11.16 here. "
"259250","259670"," I am."
"260110","261590"," I'm sure it's a little bit later wherever you are."
"261910","264070"," We have to talk about a few things this morning. "
"264850","268670"," I want to talk to you guys about the market real quick."
"271560","274980"," Let's first, let's talk about..."
"274980","277720"," Let me just check the flow right now."
"278100","280880"," Now I can start to watch the flow in real time. "
"281140","286040"," I don't have to worry about switching back and forth."
"286420","287820"," So things are gonna get better around here already."
"288520","297100"," I can call things out to you right as they happen, and we can start to talk about what's actually"
"297100","298000"," happening in the market. "
"298880","300200"," It's hard for me to afford."
"300240","303360"," It's like I've got different, different setup going right now."
"303380","304380"," Good morning, hot, hot, hot. "
"304940","306780"," Morning Charles, good morning YJP."
"309280","310300"," Hope you're all doing well."
"311400","313080"," 17, 17 here. "
"314240","315860"," Oof, it's late."
"317660","322200"," All right, so let's get a couple things out of the way before the rest of the day starts."
"322440","326660"," So yesterday, before we signed off yesterday, we talked about..."
"326660","329500"," Let me just turn this down a little bit because the gain is insane. "
"330340","336180"," Okay, so yesterday, as we were closing up, there were a few people inside of the stream, and we"
"336180","341240"," were discussing if we should hold calls overnight, and the decision was don't hold calls overnight."
"343120","345900"," And it was the idea was that dealers were selling futures."
"347860","355500"," Now, this morning's spot camera put something out saying the call wall had dropped yesterday, and"
"355500","359480"," at the end of last night, it said it went to 480 from 500. "
"360080","363220"," So we're going to take a look right now and see if it's still up there or not."
"363400","365140"," I haven't checked yet, and it has disappeared."
"365860","367280"," So this wall was here yesterday. "
"367880","373700"," There was a call wall here yesterday, and I think it began on Monday and then Tuesday, and it has"
"373700","374520"," since disappeared."
"376780","379060"," And you are seeing it now much lower, right?"
"379060","385660"," You're seeing the call wall is coming down to the 480 mark, and it looks like we can tag 480"
"386480","387160"," as well."
"387420","390960"," So maybe there's like some compression, even though we have expansion, right?"
"391080","394040"," So we had we had lots of compression, and we had some expansion yesterday. "
"394040","398600"," It looked like we were starting to, but it looks like the top right now is 480."
"400100","402820"," Now, is it better?"
"403340","404080"," Call is getting better."
"404220","404940"," Yeah, it's kind of weird. "
"405440","412860"," When you're on, really, wants you to stay healthy, gets sunshine in your skin and eyes, agreed."
"414920","415680"," So we're going to talk."
"415900","419900"," So I just want to talk to you guys real quick about where we are in the market, okay?"
"420960","426160"," Now, if you break out your charts out there, I want you guys to look at some key levels, snap"
"426160","426640"," some lines. "
"427240","431420"," We're going to talk about kind of where we are, what we're looking for."
"431420","432560"," Good morning, Kim."
"434360","438340"," Amazon seems stalled after the drop, basing, maybe. "
"438680","440480"," Yeah, well, let's talk good morning, Ritesh."
"440800","441980"," Good morning, Utrope."
"442200","443140"," Good morning, Fisted. "
"446130","448690"," So a few things."
"449050","450030"," Let's start from the beginning."
"450950","451910"," Let's start from the beginning. "
"452790","453630"," So good morning, everybody."
"453930","454810"," We have new setup going on."
"454930","455790"," It's almost complete. "
"456610","460930"," I'm waiting on one more lens, and I have a little bit more computer work to do."
"462130","465950"," And I'm able to put at least four displays up right now so that I can kind of see what"
"465950","468410"," I'm doing, start to trade with you guys and that kind of stuff."
"470410","473270"," Yesterday, we just had some Tesla calls come in, some spy calls. "
"475190","480650"," Tesla, January 7th, 1170, $421,000."
"483250","486490"," But anyway, we knew that dealers would sell futures last night."
"486590","494770"," We talked about it at the end of buying, and as a matter of fact, my spreads didn't fill. "
"495590","496930"," I didn't get the Roblox fill."
"497010","498590"," I didn't get the Amazon fill yesterday."
"499590","502330"," And good morning, little bear or a little big bear. "
"502390","502850"," Good morning, Joe."
"504690","505930"," Good morning, REI."
"506830","507230"," Yeah. "
"507590","514510"," So what we did yesterday was we know that there was sold futures, right?"
"515289","519890"," We had, we did have a call wall that went as high as I think, 490 or 500."
"520549","521190"," It has reduced."
"521970","526270"," As Spock and I mentioned it this morning, and I hadn't checked until just now, and you can see"
"526270","530810"," we're at, it looks like the call wall is some compression, we have expansion, but then it's some"
"530810","531610"," compression as well. "
"532650","533450"," It's that 480 mark."
"534270","537150"," I don't see the line above it, 490 or 500 any longer."
"538050","543230"," When we're getting back into that phase where those, where bulls are questioning, can we actually"
"543230","544330"," go to 500 or not?"
"544790","547150"," Can we go up to 490 to 4869?"
"548110","548670"," That kind of stuff. "
"549290","556110"," Now, there is this thought, right, that we cannot go below 47."
"556970","557410"," Let's take a look."
"558250","561310"," The claim is that it's 475 zero. "
"561670","564530"," It's more like, it's a little bit less than that."
"564630","569630"," We can probably go down to 47373."
"569630","572690"," I know that I think SG said 4750. "
"573330","574950"," It's more like 47373."
"576610","583350"," It's not that, it's not as low as we, if we break 4750 that we're all doom and gloom, I"
"583350","590230"," wouldn't, I would say that we did it, but two days ago we went down to 47386 and bounced straight"
"590230","591230"," back like it was nothing."
"592430","594990"," So you could call it 4750. "
"597130","600450"," I know we're moving up in the, the supports raise every day."
"601590","608770"," So maybe 47610, but if we don't go below 47373.73, we're going up."
"609050","612210"," And if we bounce down below here, I wanted to talk to you about this. "
"612670","615150"," So look at, look at the market right now from this mindset."
"615450","618650"," And further, I want you guys to know that more than likely we're trading sideways all day long."
"619450","622730"," So if you're all paranoid out there, but what's going to happen right now, you don't, you don't"
"622730","624210"," really have to, not at this point. "
"625190","626670"," But there's some thoughts here, right?"
"627010","632590"," So I want you guys to remember that when you trade, when you are range bound in a trade, let's"
"632590","637090"," say you're trading right now on the spy between 47373, right?"
"637810","640070"," And you're trading to 478."
"640850","643430"," So you know, you've got a, you got a 60 point spread, right?"
"643610","645830"," Or yes, it depends on how you count."
"646710","648770"," You can call it a six point spread if you wanted to. "
"649810","653950"," But you basically have, have a, what?"
"654530","656090"," It's 474-8."
"656290","662450"," And then you've got 475, let's say, so you've got a range of 478-475, right?"
"662670","665310"," So you have a three point or 30 point range, however you count."
"668180","674000"," Now, regardless if you're on an ETF or if you're on a stock, I want you to understand that there's"
"674000","676500"," manipulation within those trading ranges, right?"
"676760","679360"," You've got buy stops and sell stops. "
"679760","685380"," You get sell stops at 478, let's say, and you've got buy stops at, or you get buy stops at"
"685380","686380"," 475."
"686980","690000"," So I'm going to be buying 475 and selling 478."
"690860","693800"," And you know that that's where the buyers and the sellers are. "
"693800","699680"," You also know that if I buy at 475, I'm going to sell at 478, right?"
"700840","708160"," And so if we dip below that 475 or that 473.73, then I'm going to panic and get out"
"708160","708680"," of my position."
"709800","717420"," And you can see yesterday is a, well, I want to say that it was on the third, right?"
"717640","722400"," So if you look at, if you look at the close of the third into the fourth, we went up"
"722400","725740"," to 480 and we sold off immediately, right?"
"726460","729700"," And that is a manipulation tactic."
"730700","732560"," So we move outside of our trading range. "
"733100","735320"," We get panicky, we sell out of them, right?"
"735640","739220"," You also see the selling commit to that range as well."
"739320","741300"," We hit 480 and we immediately sell right off."
"741880","748940"," So the next question becomes if we go lower outside of our range, let's say we got a 473 or"
"748940","757180"," 475 to 473, there could still be a repire to, to the 481 or even 480. "
"757800","760900"," And if you're looking on the screen right now, you can see 40 above."
"761120","766560"," So if we swoop down here, when we get as low as 473, we could still swing higher to this"
"766560","766900"," 480."
"767680","771360"," So I want you to understand that as we, as we keep trading, right?"
"771840","777600"," So if you're bearish right now, let's say you're bearish, the question becomes are we going to"
"777600","780720"," trade down to 470 right now?"
"781120","785240"," Or was it 465 from where we are for 70 points?"
"785340","786840"," So we're going to trade down from 477. "
"788100","793940"," The reality is that we're more than likely going to trade up to 480, then trade down to 470 or"
"793940","794280"," even 465."
"795800","799840"," That gives you that 100 to 150 points swing, right?"
"800280","802320"," A nice beautiful swing down."
"802660","803600"," That's, no, that's my view. "
"804440","806740"," My view is that we're going to trade down."
"806880","808520"," Yesterday, we didn't quite hit the 474."
"808940","810160"," That's really what I wanted to see. "
"810520","817320"," I wanted to see that dip by right it up to 480 and then immediately sell down to, let's say"
"817320","821900"," 486 or excuse me, 465, maybe even 470."
"822320","828880"," But it still gives you a nice 100 point range, gives you a nice, you know, maybe even 120, 130,"
"829820","833000"," possibly 150 points on the down, downward side."
"833180","836040"," Now the bears at this point, they just want some downward movement, right?"
"836040","838340"," Bears are like, you know they're getting grinded up. "
"838600","841940"," I've had, I've held puts and they're just getting ground to dust."
"842440","844640"," You can make a little bit, but they're one for one."
"845080","848660"," So if you're a bear right now out there and you're trying to take puts, right?"
"849100","854520"," Unless you catch a quick moment or you're catching something that's really cheap, you already know"
"854520","856620"," that puts are generally one for one. "
"856800","857420"," They're not like calls."
"857960","861120"," I can get a call to print 10,000, 3,000."
"861820","864920"," If you want to get a put to print that, right?"
"865300","866520"," Print like 3,000 percent. "
"866980","871180"," The market pattern we go going down for like weeks, like a week, three days, four days, five days,"
"871720","873460"," and a bit better be going straight down as well."
"875200","879380"," So my point behind that is, you guys hear me?"
"882310","882630"," All right."
"883650","890010"," So the point behind that is that today you're looking for, you're still looking for a dip by to get"
"890010","890510"," up to 480. "
"891210","899470"," And if we break below, call it 473, 73, then sure, I guess you can take it to 470 or"
"899470","899630"," 465."
"900550","903590"," I just don't see that 465, 470 today."
"904290","909290"," Last thing that I want to say on that is if we trade sideways today into the following days, I"
"909290","916330"," would expect at some point between the seventh and the ninth, January 7th through the ninth, we"
"916330","918870"," will no matter what trade down to that 470, 465. "
"921660","923580"," Are you guys bearish or bullish today?"
"931920","934100"," See if I can see what you guys are reading over here."
"938580","942720"," So I don't know if you saw my tweets with Quinn blew you up a bit, but it looks like"
"942720","944060"," Uranium was totally the move."
"945560","947060"," Yeah, I'll take a look at Uranium. "
"948720","950340"," See the most recent Vanna model."
"950880","953060"," Nope, haven't seen the most recent Vanna model."
"953340","955160"," You guys want to talk to me about it in the chat, please do. "
"955560","958460"," I haven't really looked at spot camera that closely this morning."
"959020","960980"," I was trying to get a bunch of technical stuff done."
"962540","964140"," Kat, what do you think of FMC minutes?"
"964440","965360"," How much impact you might have. "
"965860","968220"," I see the FMC minutes are 2pm."
"968820","973540"," You're probably going to see some negative news come out surrounding it to just stir up some"
"973540","973860"," volatility."
"974480","977560"," You might see a weakness into the two o'clock hour. "
"978220","982480"," My expectation would be that we trade down into two o'clock hour, but I still think our target is"
"982480","982700"," 480."
"983860","984760"," Again, one more time."
"985360","986620"," Maybe even 481. "
"988650","990750"," Where do you see Tesla right before earnings release?"
"992530","994290"," Okay, I'll talk about Tesla here in just a minute."
"997780","999480"," Seems like rotation should be done."
"999740","1000320"," Breath is improving. "
"1000560","1003560"," It seems I would be wary of calling it rotation right now."
"1005260","1009620"," Bullish on a dump to buy Uranium move because of Kazakhstan."
"1009940","1010700"," Yeah, that makes sense. "
"1011800","1014100"," I think we retest for 79 before FMC."
"1014580","1016220"," Didn't we gap up in the last Fed minutes?"
"1017360","1018400"," Yes and no."
"1020420","1023480"," Tasha's dope played both calls and put so far today. "
"1024060","1024740"," She got your Uranium."
"1024740","1025079"," We love you."
"1025160","1025440"," I love you. "
"1025660","1028420"," I love the U.S. 4."
"1029200","1032300"," Okay, so a few things."
"1033119","1037560"," These FMC meeting minutes are not as critical as the last few."
"1038000","1047319"," Last few really hinged upon whether we were getting a tapering ramp, right?"
"1048780","1052860"," A faster tapering, accelerated tapering and rates and how many rates were we getting?"
"1052860","1059380"," We're getting two rates, three rates, four rates and the expectation was we get three and we were"
"1059380","1060340"," told two I believe. "
"1064620","1066540"," I want to check and see Tesla real quick."
"1067020","1073340"," Tesla, that's nice."
"1073940","1074820"," We're like Tesla right now. "
"1077060","1085260"," Okay, so a thought process right now is you've got some weakness into FMC today."
"1085500","1090700"," I don't think anything is different today unless they drop some really unknown news."
"1091140","1094840"," I think that once FMC is over, you're going to see us move up to 480 or trade up to"
"1094840","1095040"," 480. "
"1095680","1101940"," If we have the runway to do that, as we get closer to the 9th, 10th, 11th, like the 11th,"
"1101940","1104180"," we should be down at 465 by that date."
"1104720","1107520"," So you're looking for a move here in the next two, three days."
"1107940","1114120"," If we trade up into Friday, tag 480 or even Monday, let's say all the calls for 480 on this"
"1114120","1119560"," Friday roll off Monday morning, BAM, we hit 480 and then we're down to 470, 465. "
"1120720","1122320"," Bears are happy, bulls are happy."
"1122540","1124040"," Now, someone was talking about the rotation."
"1127710","1132490"," If that meant it's off for nothing new perspective wide, the protection coming off would lead to a"
"1132490","1133810"," Venerali, in my opinion. "
"1133990","1134490"," I agree with that."
"1136090","1137470"," It lands pretty solid today."
"1137670","1143250"," Okay, I want to talk to you guys about, just going to ask if anyone thought we had a Venerali"
"1143250","1143930"," in store. "
"1144770","1146710"," The Venerali kind is over."
"1147150","1148290"," I had a sheet."
"1148530","1151670"," I'll try to dig it back up ahead where all the roll-offs were coming. "
"1152190","1153730"," We have some more roll-offs this week."
"1153770","1156270"," I think we have a roll-off on Friday of some pretty big gamma."
"1156830","1158010"," Maybe we'll see it on Monday. "
"1161340","1164620"," I want to talk to you guys about this quote-unquote rotation trade."
"1165340","1166920"," I don't think that's what it is."
"1167640","1170660"," You know that dispersion trade that they're talking about right now?"
"1170900","1178140"," It's kind of where they're basically selling calls outside the money, right?"
"1178280","1179420"," There's some calls to all the bulls. "
"1180260","1181640"," Not many bulls are buying them."
"1182240","1185060"," There's a ton of puts to bears."
"1185680","1187020"," Bears are buying all these puts. "
"1189510","1191850"," They're pinning the indexes."
"1193950","1203050"," Then they're taking the shittiest stocks that make up the top, let's say, 5 or 10 of these indexes"
"1203050","1208690"," that are beaten down and then they're just buying straight calls in stock in these companies."
"1209290","1211790"," So I was talking to you guys about AMC yesterday. "
"1213430","1217790"," You notice Nicola get ripped this morning and yesterday on Bullshit News."
"1219030","1224030"," Now, you've noticed the past few days there have been companies that have been ripping, right?"
"1224230","1228530"," You've seen, in fact, Nicola just went up to $11.51, right?"
"1229310","1236390"," The idea is in this dispersion trading is that there are hedge funds and banks right now that are"
"1236390","1243210"," selling index bulls and bears a bunch of shit and then they're going into components of other"
"1243210","1246870"," indexes and ripping stocks up."
"1247210","1252530"," They're making stocks that are pinned way, way low, sold off and one by one, they're trading them"
"1252530","1252670"," up. "
"1259430","1262670"," Yeah, so let's say if you guys right now, let's see if you take a basket of stocks."
"1262830","1264830"," Do you guys know what dispersion trading trading is?"
"1265210","1267290"," Does everybody out there know what dispersion trading is?"
"1268410","1269350"," Does everybody understand it?"
"1270070","1271110"," I can explain it simply."
"1271950","1277070"," I watched a video that gave me the best description I could find and I was very happy with it. "
"1277250","1280050"," So basically it's pretty neat, right?"
"1280290","1280950"," This is really neat."
"1281190","1281890"," You guys know what it is?"
"1284950","1287930"," What are the M's buying all the way outside of money spreads on Tesla?"
"1288350","1291450"," Yeah, they could be buying outside of money spreads as well, selling them to."
"1292010","1293070"," Good morning, Betty Mac. "
"1294530","1295730"," So the idea would be this."
"1296650","1306330"," If you had a car, or let's say I had a car and let's say the car"
"1306330","1308570"," is IWM, small caps."
"1309190","1310810"," You have small caps, IWM. "
"1312530","1316610"," And within IWM, you know that the top 10 stocks within it."
"1319070","1328770"," Let's say this car has tires and engine, seats, doors, windows, and you could get more"
"1328770","1335150"," money from the parts of that car, but not the car itself, right?"
"1335490","1339230"," Or sell, buy and sell those parts, like you could buy a door."
"1340110","1345490"," So let's say you could buy, let's say it was an index, you could buy AMC for dirt cheap, 25"
"1345490","1346730"," bucks, right?"
"1347810","1348970"," And then sell it for 50. "
"1350750","1355530"," Whereas if you are going to try to trade the IWM, you're not going to make as much money on"
"1355530","1360890"," the IWM going up, you know, to 230 or 240."
"1362210","1370510"," So what you'd end up doing is you pin the IWM, you make high-flying, larger components of IWM are"
"1370510","1372190"," kind of keeping it down or whatever."
"1372830","1374970"," And you're selling calls and puts an IWM. "
"1375430","1376870"," Meanwhile, I've always focused on IWM."
"1377350","1379890"," Hey, IWM is going up, IWM is going up, but it really isn't."
"1380670","1385270"," When what they're doing is they're taking a basket of 10 stocks underneath it, making it rip, you"
"1385270","1389330"," end up chasing afterward after it's ripped, they take all their money and leave that stock. "
"1396500","1397900"," It's very much like the solid business."
"1398760","1408520"," So I look up the dispersion trading, dispersion, this is called something else, but that's the"
"1408520","1412280"," idea of, because people are saying, well, there's a rotation in the market right now."
"1413160","1419680"," And once these big fly, once Apple and Amazon come down, the market's going to collapse, yada,"
"1419800","1420620"," yada, yada. "
"1420620","1421980"," In reality, that's not going to happen."
"1424590","1428330"," They're going to trade the index of sideways and they're going to make a ton of money off of low,"
"1428330","1435150"," you know, as a prime example, you saw XLF kind of fly yesterday, but in reality, you saw the"
"1435150","1437970"," components of XLF go booming."
"1438970","1442190"," They traded the hell out of Zoom yesterday, XOM. "
"1443970","1446050"," You saw Nicola get ripped, right?"
"1446470","1451630"," Nicola went up from, Nicola was at what, nine bucks, eight bucks, something like that, they went up"
"1451630","1453050"," like six or seven percent this morning."
"1454750","1456990"," And you might want to start today."
"1457910","1466050"," If you have the time, look at some of the stocks, look at like the top 10 stocks within IWM,"
"1466690","1469970"," or some of the value names, and you'll see which ones are ripping. "
"1470830","1474990"," You saw what kind of John Deere ripped yesterday, I think."
"1475830","1478810"," So they're just grabbing one of these stuff like one at a time, they're going through and just"
"1478810","1480030"," pumping these stocks up."
"1482110","1482810"," Good morning, Mario. "
"1485580","1488580"," Let me see, Tilray in the same, is Tilray in the same boat."
"1489100","1494300"," What I would say is that you make a, you make a watch list of 50 or 100 stocks and"
"1494300","1495820"," you see which ones they're pumping each day."
"1496760","1501180"," And so you can target individual tickers rather than just the indexes right now currently. "
"1502060","1505780"," What they end up doing too is they're bleeding all these bulls and bears in the indexes."
"1514820","1520000"," You see in Tesla being weak right now, Tesla probably get weak down to the 475, 473."
"1520560","1529940"," If there is no negative or unknown news inside, of the FOMC minutes at 2 PM, then"
"1529940","1531680"," you're going to be looking to buy some calls. "
"1532320","1542280"," And yes, mostly most FOMC minutes, last two or three, I've usually bought zero dates, half an hour"
"1542280","1543060"," before FOMC."
"1543460","1549360"," And you can tell if everybody's loaded, you can tell which side everybody's loaded up on, and you"
"1549360","1550280"," pick the opposite side."
"1550920","1555840"," So if everybody's loaded up on the call side, a half an hour before FOMC, I usually take the"
"1555840","1556540"," contrarian trade. "
"1557240","1563160"," If everybody's loaded up on the put side, half an hour before FOMC, I usually take the opposite"
"1563160","1563880"," side of that trade."
"1565420","1570420"," So I'll look right now, we'll look and see what spy is shaping up for heading into FOMC."
"1578890","1584390"," And so you get everybody's loaded up on, everybody's loaded up on 478C. "
"1585410","1588130"," For FOMC even right now, which is kind of insane."
"1589450","1594310"," And then I'm looking at, let's look at January 7th."
"1595290","1604390"," And actually, you get everybody loaded up on 476 P for puts on Friday, January 7th. "
"1605190","1609310"," The more conservative bear out there, the more taste-driven bear."
"1615410","1616750"," Let's take a look at the NPH."
"1617090","1618470"," I used to love trading the NPH. "
"1641000","1643180"," Still not ready for NPH."
"1643840","1644920"," Still not there."
"1645760","1646560"," Almost there. "
"1647360","1648040"," Not quite."
"1649920","1656740"," But I'm going to put it on my list because, let's see when it started trading."
"1660960","1664700"," Yeah, it's not like NPH is not a good company. "
"1665820","1667980"," Because they are, it doesn't matter what they tell you in the news."
"1668880","1678080"," The news is used for, the news is used for,"
"1679000","1681040"," I'm going to put that on my list."
"1681540","1682420"," Let me get a piece of paper. "
"1682560","1683700"," I'm going to write a list right now."
"1691380","1693960"," So why don't you guys text me right now?"
"1695640","1703100"," Why don't you guys, wait a minute, wait a minute, NPH, MU."
"1705600","1706220"," Hold on. "
"1709520","1715300"," Okay, so give me a list, in the chat box, I want you to give me a list of stocks"
"1715820","1718020"," that you think are going to turn around in 2022."
"1719000","1722620"," 2022, it sounded like Joe Biden in 2020."
"1724900","1730520"," Give me a list of stocks that you think are the trade of 2022, ENPH. "
"1730880","1733160"," Because I think the NPH can get on that list at some point."
"1734440","1742150"," Yeah, I can take a look at a misfit and I'll take a look at AMC for everybody that's out"
"1742150","1742390"," there."
"1743170","1749490"," Can you guys, can you guys in the chat box just text me what you think between one and three"
"1749490","1756150"," stocks so that I can look at them for the basket of stocks this weekend?"
"1758530","1763570"," I want to see what you guys have and versus what I've got. "
"1764790","1771270"," So we're going to look at AMC real quick because I think I'm going to talk to you guys about"
"1771270","1772070"," AMC in a little bit."
"1772170","1776450"," I don't think AMC is ready to turn yet but I think it has a fair chance of turning in"
"1776450","1779010"," the next week."
"1779790","1784170"," I think in the next week there's going to be a big turn in AMC and I know that everybody"
"1784170","1785030"," disagrees with that. "
"1788870","1793450"," So yesterday we had, I guess we had this nice little support area here."
"1793510","1794970"," This still looks like support to me."
"1795370","1798690"," It was at 25 yesterday so it has come down. "
"1801190","1802450"," We had this nice support."
"1802730","1808050"," Now I've got trap sellers above at 25, 26 and you've got buyers down below at 23."
"1810590","1818130"," You got more sellers than buyers and you've got negative put flow on AMC at the moment. "
"1818890","1821550"," Look at misfit next MSFT."
"1827900","1831460"," Don't put just the stocks you love in there that you're trapped in."
"1831640","1837160"," Put stocks that you think are going to have a turn in 2022 because if I bring them up on"
"1837160","1846980"," a chart and it looks pretty ugly like they ain't coming back then I'm not going to put them in"
"1846980","1848100"," the Sunday stream. "
"1848980","1854800"," Why you guys to think about, why you guys to think about what tickers you think are going to be"
"1854800","1855640"," big in 2022."
"1857260","1859340"," So Tilray, I'll look at that one again."
"1860240","1862800"," I don't like Tilray but I'll look at Baba. "
"1864800","1865220"," Plug."
"1865620","1867880"," You guys, you guys are all pick."
"1870180","1872200"," I'll look at all of these. "
"1873120","1874280"," Came up as a tough one."
"1876020","1877480"," Yeah, I've got a Tesla video."
"1877480","1878280"," I just have to upload it. "
"1880200","1881500"," I made a Tesla video."
"1882360","1883640"," I was having a chance to upload it yet."
"1884420","1894080"," CPMG, PLTR, NNDM, Neo"
"1894080","1896260"," TSM. "
"1898680","1906380"," Yeah, I think the thing that kills you about reading this list from you guys is you guys love, you"
"1906380","1907740"," guys are like masochists."
"1910660","1914380"," You guys just want to get strapped to the board and get whipped."
"1915200","1916420"," Bill Feds, either. "
"1917400","1917960"," Rig."
"1918420","1919940"," I want to look at that one for sure."
"1923680","1930440"," BA, C-P-E-N-G, N-G, Neo. "
"1930700","1931780"," I think I have some of those already."
"1932940","1934260"," Tesla Palantor, ABMB."
"1935260","1936500"," I like the ABMB trade. "
"1937600","1939100"," LMT, I used to trade that."
"1940480","1942300"," And you, OSTK."
"1942520","1943500"," I like OSTK. "
"1944200","1946860"," OSTK was a kick-ass trade in 2021, by the way."
"1947060","1947260"," I think."
"1947940","1948380"," I remember correctly. "
"1948400","1948980"," I can't remember."
"1949540","1950540"," Or it's turning around."
"1950740","1951360"," It's one of those two. "
"1953540","1961300"," So DK and G, just so you guys know, is I don't think it's going to be the start or"
"1961300","1971100"," I don't think it's going to be the one that goes C Palantor,"
"1971220","1977520"," LMT, DK-N-G, Tesla, TLTR, TSM, BA, Snow."
"1978740","1979660"," We can look at Snow."
"1984280","1985680"," Next slide heads up, T-Crown. "
"1986100","1987640"," T-Crown just said, be careful with Rig."
"1989220","1991960"," Highest chance of bankruptcy of the offshore drillers."
"1992520","1994880"," You know, there is a guy stepping stone trader. "
"1995920","1996700"," You might want to hook up."
"1997080","1998480"," He looked this guy up on Twitter."
"1999160","2000860"," His name is Stepping Stone Trader. "
"2001680","2003340"," I think, yeah, Stepping Stone Trader."
"2003620","2004180"," Look him up."
"2004760","2009160"," He, I think he used to work in oil and gas rigs. "
"2009840","2010880"," And he was like the guy."
"2011420","2014820"," And the guy, uh, the guy that we have cap doesn't want our bags."
"2016500","2018380"," It's, you know, we'll talk about that too on Sunday. "
"2018580","2022720"," It's important for you guys to, or anyways, Rig, look up at Stepping Stone Trader."
"2022960","2029280"," I think he worked in some capacity, some supervisory capacity, magic capacity."
"2029900","2032520"," I think XLF is going to be huge with rate increases. "
"2033420","2036740"," Yeah, XLF is going to be a kind of a, kind of a no brainer to an extent."
"2037740","2039900"," I don't like how it trades because it's not liquid enough."
"2040760","2042320"," I've traded XLF many times. "
"2042640","2050620"," I've made great money and then I've lost some money, even when it should be going up Roku, A-G "
"2050620","2064780","-F-Y, A-F-R-M, Fang, Tesla, Milco, SoFi,"
"2067380","2068980"," E-G-L-X."
"2070360","2071800"," Like the idea of that one."
"2071920","2072780"," I want to check that one out. "
"2075080","2076380"," Don't touch until next year."
"2076860","2077080"," Okay."
"2077639","2078480"," Maybe gold miners. "
"2082380","2082860"," Sweet."
"2083040","2083480"," Hell yeah, Brad."
"2085719","2087699"," On the, uh, trade on pound here. "
"2088300","2089080"," Easy L-X."
"2090380","2091540"," S-N-B-R."
"2094199","2095159"," All right. "
"2095380","2101940"," So, because, because on, so, the thing is this, is that every year, right?"
"2102100","2107440"," Every year, you guys know that every year, there's a new ticker or let's say, let's say look back"
"2107440","2113900"," at Wall Street Bets, favorite tickers or retail's favorite tickers from 2019, 2020, 2021."
"2114400","2115960"," They're different every year to an extent."
"2116560","2118900"," Not always, but they are somewhat to an extent. "
"2119280","2119560"," Roblox."
"2119720","2120320"," I like Roblox."
"2123280","2124320"," S-N-B-R. "
"2124880","2125560"," I'm Mike Jordan."
"2125760","2126180"," Good morning, Chase."
"2126440","2126680"," How are you?"
"2126840","2127320"," Good afternoon. "
"2128040","2128560"," Blood's done."
"2129280","2129400"," Yeah."
"2129840","2132440"," So, I agree that it's probably Penn. "
"2132880","2137720"," So, supposedly, supposedly one of these betting companies is going under, under."
"2138480","2147080"," I doubt that that MGM, but supposedly one of these, supposedly one of these, uh, online betting"
"2147080","2151700"," companies will be bankrupt by end of year, and they're being traded down because of it."
"2152640","2153800"," I got pound two already. "
"2154460","2155240"," I know what to run on."
"2155480","2156700"," Hey, Matt, S, how you feeling?"
"2156820","2157580"," You feeling any better, brother?"
"2158760","2159060"," CVX."
"2162870","2163170"," BP. "
"2164650","2165430"," B-A-C."
"2166530","2167010"," N-O-C."
"2168450","2168450"," Ford. "
"2169190","2169190"," Okay."
"2169550","2169570"," Yeah."
"2169670","2171430"," I can, I'll look at, I mean, I'll look at all those. "
"2173850","2174150"," BBBY."
"2174410","2174570"," Okay."
"2174730","2176490"," I don't mind looking at BBBY, BBY again. "
"2178610","2180030"," But let's think about something."
"2180210","2185650"," You guys all just texted me a lot of stocks that, some of them will probably come back and have"
"2185650","2186290"," a great year."
"2186850","2187030"," Okay. "
"2187050","2187810"," So, that's MSFT."
"2187810","2189930"," You guys see support right now in MSFT."
"2191010","2192410"," So, it's kind of coming down here. "
"2193470","2201230"," This is a very light support, real support right now on MSFT is 321."
"2201570","2202210"," I'd be a buyer here."
"2202490","2202770"," No doubt. "
"2204450","2204890"," 321."
"2207420","2211580"," We're going to go to, what's the next sticker you guys want me to look at real quick?"
"2212900","2215760"," Looks like spies is slightly weak right now too."
"2217200","2227460"," I want"
"2227460","2232900"," you to also check out at this moment, check out Victoria's Secret, VSC0. "
"2232900","2234680"," It peaked out."
"2234880","2237720"," I put that on a watch list this morning on, on Captain's Alpha."
"2238420","2243980"," It peaked out at 119880. "
"2244520","2248320"," And it looks like there's a dip being bought on it right now, VSC0."
"2248580","2249560"," We'll look at it real quick."
"2250940","2251680"," Hold on here. "
"2252240","2253440"," We're going to look at VSC0."
"2254120","2255440"," It would get a trade on this one."
"2255600","2256220"," We'll check it first. "
"2261300","2267860"," So, VSC0, we'll blow through these real quick for you, probably take any more requests from you"
"2267860","2268020"," guys."
"2268160","2269720"," I'm going to go through some stocks with you this morning."
"2270900","2271960"," We're going to see what's happening. "
"2272640","2280500"," So, if you look at, so VSC0 has a big jankery bar that currently right at this moment at 5815."
"2282320","2286340"," We're going to take a quick look at it and see what's happening on this trade."
"2304830","2310850"," Set an alert on 54, 5391. "
"2312370","2315070"," Set another alert at 5540."
"2316150","2320230"," And you can probably run that up to 6150 on VSC0."
"2320770","2322390"," Just pay attention to it this morning. "
"2322650","2324570"," There was a tag earlier at 5811."
"2325950","2328070"," You can get more granular on this to what's happening."
"2330500","2332780"," Some buyers down here at 5753. "
"2333740","2334720"," Looks like it's a crack."
"2334980","2337240"," We got sellers above here at 5859."
"2337900","2339060"," So, it isn't some traffic. "
"2341340","2346160"," Keep an eye out on this down at 5532."
"2349480","2350680"," That's really low though."
"2351720","2352240"," 5532. "
"2352940","2353540"," That's pretty low."
"2355080","2355880"," Looks like the price."
"2356160","2361100"," Looks like the price target's on it is 6157. "
"2362720","2365020"," You do have more sellers than buyers currently."
"2367240","2368540"," That'd be a nice dip buy though."
"2376130","2377950"," Maybe at 5754. "
"2382870","2384130"," Keep an eye on that one."
"2385710","2387130"," Because it is on fire."
"2387450","2388710"," That thing's been running for two days. "
"2389030","2390570"," We're one and a half days right now."
"2394090","2395910"," Also, keep an eye out on B.A. currently."
"2396950","2401490"," They're about to tag up on their B.A. ran this morning as well. "
"2401650","2402810"," We talked about that one pre-market."
"2403610","2405530"," I did a post on Captain's Alpha."
"2406210","2407730"," B.A. ran right out the gate right. "
"2408290","2410470"," So, we'll look at B.A. and see if that's going to get picked up again."
"2420480","2432680"," B.A. is sitting at 216.45. You've"
"2432680","2433480"," currently got more."
"2433800","2436480"," Looks like you got more sellers than buyers. "
"2437360","2438840"," You've got some resistance above it."
"2438940","2439340"," 217."
"2440740","2441160"," 219. "
"2442720","2443140"," 220."
"2452080","2453340"," 235 is the target."
"2459650","2461650"," Let's see if we can find more buyers below. "
"2468150","2469310"," Now you're almost at it."
"2470310","2475990"," You could try to buy it at 215, but you've got a lot of resistance ahead right here on B "
"2475990","2477690",".A. Gave trade might be over for the day."
"2484380","2486300"," E.A. is pulling away this morning as well. "
"2486500","2487580"," They had a nice rip-off close."
"2487880","2489700"," They had a nice bounce right out the gate."
"2490480","2493100"," E.A. and E.A. looks like it's getting ready to rip higher. "
"2494140","2495160"," Take a look at that one next."
"2508600","2514140"," Just saw some AMC calls coming in January 7th, 26C for 12 grand."
"2523700","2524140"," Yep. "
"2524760","2526300"," So, here might be a quick one for you."
"2527200","2529120"," You guys open up E.A. and your charts."
"2534550","2536610"," It's looking like it wants to rip real quick. "
"2537430","2539350"," You've got light resistance above it."
"2539630","2546210"," 66.93. Price target is 67.83. It's a nice little rip right there."
"2546310","2546730"," It's a nice setup. "
"2548950","2558820"," Open up E.A. You have"
"2558820","2560860"," some smart money down below at $63."
"2563220","2568280"," And you've got even smarter money down below at $59.96 and $58."
"2569340","2579100"," Looks like the target is $67.79. Slightly more sellers than buyers, but it's close. "
"2580160","2581240"," Worth keeping an eye on this morning."
"2581240","2582300"," Where are the afternoon?"
"2587330","2590290"," Let's look at John Deere real quick and see if that trade is over."
"2610050","2612110"," Looks like AMC's bottoming out here. "
"2612450","2614250"," We'll take another look at AMC if that's real or fake."
"2615430","2616070"," Just a second."
"2622830","2625610"," Still have more buyers and sellers on John Deere. "
"2632020","2634360"," It already hit 386 and ricocheted off."
"2634580","2636440"," You can see where that resistance was above here."
"2637500","2641620"," Strong, strong resistance above at $90. "
"2643400","2646520"," If you wanted to re-enter, you've got some more resistance above here at $400."
"2648840","2650280"," I'd say it's still strong though."
"2651660","2654240"," This might be a place you can take a position in John Deere. "
"2655000","2664960"," Looks like there's some buyers down below at $359.355. Still price targets of $390.400."
"2666740","2670280"," Still have more buyers and sellers on a more granular level."
"2670700","2682060"," Wait for $37.701. Some more slight resistance at $380, but it's a"
"2682060","2682560"," nice one too."
"2682720","2683160"," I like that one. "
"2687260","2691240"," Look at AMC one more time because there is some call flow coming in on AMC."
"2692160","2695180"," Keep laid eye on this one to HYFM."
"2698580","2700900"," January 21st, 25c. "
"2701700","2703320"," Someone spent $88 grand on it."
"2705140","2706560"," It's a cheap ticker."
"2708100","2709380"," Calls were $750. "
"2710360","2722400"," They bought a 750, 25c's for January 21st at $1.17. The ticker"
"2722400","2727880"," is Hotel Yankee Foxtrot Mike, H-Y-F-M."
"2736760","2739080"," Look at this sneaky little trade down here huh?"
"2739840","2740240"," Look at AMC."
"2742360","2751360"," Some sneaky little buyers down here at $23.50. Some real buyers down here at $23.03, $23.06. See"
"2751360","2754220"," where firm support is on AMC. "
"2758180","2760040"," Wonder if the AMC squeezes here."
"2763560","2765660"," I mean we're really what's next up right?"
"2766220","2768380"," $0.00. I don't know that."
"2773960","2775500"," Is this AMC trading happening?"
"2775720","2777140"," Is this trade actually happening today?"
"2778540","2780340"," I wouldn't be shocked if it started today. "
"2780960","2784660"," Problem with taking the trade though today is that it might still take two to three days."
"2785240","2787580"," Maybe five days forward to rip higher."
"2788180","2789240"," Might be a nice call spread. "
"2797020","2800400"," And on Sunday I want to do this video with you guys so I can show you when to buy"
"2800400","2800700"," the dip."
"2801860","2804100"," When to look for the turn in the stock."
"2810800","2813160"," How long has AMC been going down now for?"
"2814040","2814900"," Sometime right?"
"2818060","2823080"," Since September 13th it's been what?"
"2823680","2824180"," Three months?"
"2826000","2827180"," Three months?"
"2827720","2828180"," 90 days?"
"2831670","2833040"," And going down down down. "
"2835610","2837840"," Had that little bit of capitulation down at 20 bucks."
"2838660","2840800"," It's making its second dip right now."
"2841280","2843480"," Maybe you catch that second dip for a little bit. "
"2843920","2846780"," Let it dip a third time and then you look for the big huge one."
"2849900","2851380"," Then take it to 45 bucks."
"2853580","2857420"," I still see AMC at like three bucks but at the same time. "
"2858400","2862580"," Like honestly I do think AMC goes down to three five dollars whatever."
"2867610","2869510"," Yeah I'll look at some tickets for you here in just a second."
"2875420","2877500"," Have any of you guys been playing tap by the way?"
"2878040","2879560"," Tap has just been crushing it. "
"2880480","2882760"," The Molson course trades but I'm for like a week I think."
"2897340","2898560"," Excellis still cranking."
"2899140","2902500"," MU's up 1.86% to the moon. "
"2905420","2909840"," Viacom's up 2% just keeps cranking and trading that Viacom."
"2916900","2917640"," EA's up."
"2921520","2922140"," We're going to look up. "
"2922420","2925880"," You guys, you guys, none of you guys traded B.O. XL this morning."
"2927140","2928240"," That's up 3%."
"2928240","2929060"," That was on the list. "
"2931420","2932620"," SWKS was on the list."
"2932880","2933460"," They're up right now."
"2933560","2934080"," They're ready to rip. "
"2935760","2936120"," SWKS."
"2950110","2951530"," A.E.O ripped off the bow."
"2953030","2953910"," Came back down. "
"2955090","2955670"," That's American Eagle."
"2973070","2975470"," VMW posted that one this morning on a captain's alpha."
"2975770","2977430"," That one just kept ripping right off the bow. "
"2977550","2978070"," It hasn't stopped."
"2978690","2979510"," Just keeps going up."
"2980230","3001140"," Went from 119 to 124.40. So"
"3001140","3003240"," tap by it at 46 solid at 52. "
"3005900","3008200"," Might be at a local top right now too."
"3008700","3009040"," Could be good."
"3009200","3011900"," That might be a nice trade or might be a nice short eventually. "
"3012800","3014160"," If you guys are getting bearish on tap."
"3015940","3022900"," It doesn't break through 51.54. You might have a nice short on you at some point."
"3024500","3025740"," 51.86, call it. "
"3027020","3030660"," If you're bullish, you could probably grab it at 46.92 and run it up to 52."
"3031440","3032380"," It's right in the middle right now."
"3034120","3035800"," Alright, let's look at what you guys were requesting earlier. "
"3041320","3042860"," You guys called out a bunch of tickers."
"3044600","3046120"," Cap, can we look at Qualcomm?"
"3046800","3047420"," Where are we looking at here?"
"3047920","3049000"," Just scroll back a little bit."
"3057050","3057890"," The ticker name. "
"3058230","3058970"," Oh, it's cut off."
"3059810","3060510"," Okay, hold on."
"3060590","3061230"," Let me see if I can get it. "
"3061350","3062190"," Let me see if I can get it."
"3067590","3068630"," Can you guys see it now?"
"3078060","3078700"," Is that better?"
"3081040","3082360"," Let me see if I can make this better."
"3089240","3089540"," Desperado. "
"3093060","3094480"," Thank you, ML, for the tip today."
"3095380","3096660"," Benny Mac, thanks for the tip today."
"3099000","3100480"," A rune, thanks for the tip yesterday. "
"3100880","3102400"," Junior Stonks, thanks for the tip yesterday."

"3110040","3111700"," Kristofer, I think I got everybody so far."
"3111880","3113200"," Can you guys see the ticker name now?"
"3113840","3114540"," Is that better?"
"3117240","3118720"," Let's see if you guys can see everything."
"3125950","3126690"," Does that help?"
"3132320","3133100"," Alright, hold on. "
"3140220","3143740"," This will be a call so they can move the screen over so we can see the ticker on the"
"3143740","3144000"," tab."
"3144600","3145740"," Let me know if that works for you guys."
"3147980","3157140"," I was listening in to the podcast about farm sector and lady who was in touch with farmers said"
"3157140","3158300"," many aren't buying farmer equipment. "
"3158900","3159940"," Yeah, it's really weird to chase."
"3160240","3161880"," There's this big push right now."
"3161900","3169440"," People are saying that if you don't want to invest in bonds during inflation or when rates are"
"3169440","3172400"," increased that you can invest in farmland. "
"3173920","3174780"," There are funds."
"3175180","3183120"," They're not really part of the stock market but I'm not really, we're going to have that talk on"
"3183120","3183580"," Sunday."
"3186860","3190000"," And while your best inflation hedges the S&P 500. "
"3191300","3193160"," So I want to do QCOM next."
"3195760","3197880"," So that's tap TAP, I think that's Molson."
"3198860","3200580"," The trade's been on for like a week I think. "
"3203800","3205360"," We're going to do QCOM next."
"3207780","3212020"," And thanks for the heads up on the screen not being able to see the ticker."
"3220480","3222120"," Not sure that's good for dare. "
"3222460","3223760"," You know what dare is right now?"
"3226020","3235940"," There's a viewpoint right now that if you hide in stocks that produce real things for real money"
"3236580","3243260"," that that'll be the trade of 2022 due to if the market goes down."
"3244220","3249900"," There's an argument by some hedge funds that disagree with that."
"3250720","3255220"," They think that they're being loaded on right now, right?"
"3255480","3259700"," So if the market falls, all stocks fall in unison now. "
"3259820","3260880"," Everybody's making the same trades."
"3261740","3266060"," It's got some nice bashing going on on QCOM."
"3268000","3271020"," Got some resistance above here at 193.80, 194. "
"3272400","3274380"," Nice dip buy down here at 192."
"3276800","3278640"," Lots of interest today in QCOM."
"3280240","3286920"," A big sell for QCOM is 194.84. Even if you get through this stuff right here it looks like. "
"3286920","3295860"," Got lots of sellers and your ultimate price target is 199.52. So if you can take your calls to"
"3295860","3304060"," 194.70, get out of them and then pick them back up at 195.30 to 200 if that trade"
"3304060","3305360"," is still going on today."
"3306160","3309280"," You do have more sellers than buyers currently in QCOM."
"3315680","3319780"," Okay, you see that GPN, that GPN golden ticket?"
"3320100","3321020"," Last week I saw that one. "
"3324870","3327490"," Let's see if I can get down to the rest of you guys I'm talking about."
"3332830","3334190"," Let's see what you guys are saying."
"3334370","3334990"," Hand me a scroll through. "
"3339930","3341030"," You guys are so fast."
"3341250","3342110"," You guys type so much."
"3342390","3342890"," How about Facebook?"
"3343350","3343430"," Yep. "
"3344910","3346370"," Let's see if you get a chance later."
"3347610","3347750"," Jesus."
"3348010","3348490"," All right, I'll be quick. "
"3355020","3356140"," Roblox is coming to us."
"3356300","3357160"," Yeah, I like Roblox."
"3358360","3359960"," I mean, look at Roblox right now. "
"3369140","3370120"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"3371260","3373340"," Your correct Roblox is coming to us."
"3378000","3380900"," I hope my hope is that Roblox will go down next week. "
"3381080","3385880"," I think the market's going to sell off at some point around the 10th, leading into the 10th, maybe"
"3385880","3387160"," like 8th, 9th, 10th."
"3387660","3389020"," So maybe I'm going to wait right now."
"3389380","3393080"," I guess I could take this trade into the weekend, maybe on a Friday. "
"3393860","3400540"," When reality at this point, now I want to wait to buy some stocks until the 10th."
"3402180","3403700"," Interested in these three if you get a chance later."
"3404040","3404440"," GNRC. "
"3407240","3408560"," That's what these out real quick."
"3431750","3433630"," You guys looking for real levels on tickers?"
"3433770","3434090"," I get that."
"3434550","3435150"," I like this one. "
"3435350","3435650"," It's nice."
"3436730","3437190"," It's real nice."
"3438130","3439690"," You get some real nice support at 320. "
"3440910","3442450"," You got more support down 301."
"3443350","3444710"," The price target is 350."
"3445370","3446530"," Good job on GNRC. "
"3454340","3456340"," And then you've got ASAN."
"3461940","3462760"," This is SANA."
"3467590","3468670"," Try to only throw. "
"3469610","3470770"," Try to only throw."
"3471130","3472230"," Do I like XBI?"
"3472590","3474670"," Try not to throw so many tickers at me, like one at a time."
"3475110","3476150"," I can't do a ton of them. "
"3476550","3478110"," I'll do as many as I can right here."
"3479270","3480190"," You've got great support."
"3480390","3480930"," It's another great one. "
"3481030","3482930"," Asana, finding some great support."
"3483690","3485270"," You got more buyers than sellers."
"3485270","3486430"," This is a great trade right now. "
"3487250","3490250"," Buyers at 63.14. Price target, 67."
"3491750","3492630"," Night, great trade."
"3493010","3495350"," You have real support though down at 60 bucks. "
"3495970","3496930"," Be conscious of that."
"3497510","3499030"," Though it looks like it's on an uptrend right now."
"3499090","3502370"," It's going to try to tag 67.19 let's say. "
"3502770","3503690"," It's another good one."
"3504270","3506270"," Someone's throwing out some kick-ass tickers today."
"3507250","3509230"," And we're going to look at SQ next. "
"3512940","3515180"," You guys can always pause this broadcast."
"3516620","3522280"," Go back to where you saw me do a ticker right down."
"3522400","3525980"," What you need to write down for your own notes. "
"3526560","3529940"," And then you refresh the page and you come back to where we are live."
"3533260","3534680"," Ooh, I like this one too."
"3535260","3537100"," Dude, who did these tickers?"
"3537680","3538300"," Zach Burton. "
"3538920","3539520"," Hello lady."
"3540030","3545480"," My geez, Zach Burton called out three bangers right now."
"3546760","3548720"," SQ, bouncing off support. "
"3549600","3555040"," Hard support, 150.23. Let me see that trade right now myself."
"3556980","3559060"," Smoking trades from Zach Burton."
"3560540","3561620"," Guy knows his stuff. "
"3564860","3567940"," Oh yeah, I like that trade, Zach."
"3569020","3572260"," Let's look a little bit deeper and see if we've got more support somewhere else."
"3572440","3576020"," I like it. "
"3576280","3581220"," I like this SQ trade again."
"3584420","3589800"," So what SQ is going to either fall off the face of the earth right at this point."
"3594000","3596440"," You know, it's funny too on my chart. "
"3597120","3599400"," I have this exact number."
"3601800","3602820"," I have SQ."
"3603580","3604360"," This is true. "
"3604640","3606540"," Like, I don't know if you guys can see this."
"3607040","3607620"," I've got SQ."
"3608480","3611300"," See those two lines I've got there on the bottom. "
"3612140","3614840"," This is my buy zone for SQ."
"3615120","3617680"," I probably have an email right now saying buy SQ."
"3618360","3621860"," But my price target in SQ is between 135 and 150. "
"3621860","3622320"," 50."
"3625340","3626120"," It's a nice trade."
"3626760","3627180"," You know what?"
"3627380","3628440"," I'm probably going to take this trade. "
"3628540","3631320"," I'm going to look down at 135 and see if support."
"3634000","3637460"," And nope, it looks like you might attack just right."
"3640380","3641680"," You look at this real quick. "
"3642560","3643180"," You know what?"
"3643860","3646040"," I'm going to place a trade here, I think, on SQ."
"3647760","3648700"," When is SQ?"
"3649700","3650860"," What is SQ?"
"3651660","3652520"," Hang tight, guys."
"3653260","3654220"," What is SQ earnings?"
"3656200","3658640"," I mean, it could trade slightly down into earnings. "
"3664310","3665850"," It's February 22nd."
"3668410","3671250"," It's a nice trade."
"3678590","3681890"," What I like is that you just gave me three banging tickers. "
"3683650","3685530"," It's straight banging tickers."
"3693980","3695400"," Where are we at right now?"
"3697620","3697860"," 150?"
"3701120","3701680"," 150."
"3707310","3709650"," There's all kinds of interest to after ER. "
"3711030","3716950"," You know, I mean, the second part is that the last ER was so bad that they're probably going to"
"3716950","3719390"," trade sideways to down right into ER."
"3722290","3724970"," That's to be expected in any ticker that had a bad ER."
"3726470","3728110"," So let's say a trade is down to 135. "
"3728750","3732290"," Like just grinds down to 135 and it's going to rocket ship."
"3734710","3736070"," But there are buyers here."
"3736690","3738430"," There's no doubt that there's buyers here. "
"3740270","3742290"," And you've got more buyers than sellers."
"3743090","3744850"," Hero indicators turning positive on SQ."
"3745410","3746890"," I might take a small SQ trade. "
"3749150","3750810"," I'm interested in that one right now."
"3753510","3753910"," XBI."
"3754110","3754970"," We can do XBI next. "
"3755390","3757070"," Sorry, I'm taking me a bit to get you."
"3757130","3759870"," When you guys bogged me down, like, you guys put weight meters up there."
"3760750","3767090"," But Zach, you can put as many as you want up there because you know how to look for bottoms. "
"3768030","3769290"," And that is critical."
"3769750","3771070"," I don't like chasing bags."
"3772010","3775710"," And those three tickers you just posted don't look like we're chasing bags. "
"3778590","3784530"," Yeah, the bio tech trade might be over right now."
"3785810","3788130"," You've got more sellers than buyers than XBI."
"3789810","3792370"," And I want to say that XBI is cooling down. "
"3794510","3795710"," Let me see."
"3799350","3800030"," Tap."
"3802070","3803190"," What else you got?"
"3803190","3804610"," That's in CCJ. "
"3807090","3809110"," I'll write CCJ down and look at it."
"3812570","3813210"," Yeah, BBC."
"3813710","3814850"," Wherever BBC is out there. "
"3814990","3815590"," Thank you for your tip."
"3817790","3818490"," Quinn is here."
"3819050","3819310"," Hey, Quinn. "
"3819910","3820470"," Good to see you, brother."
"3821190","3821710"," Hey, Quinn."
"3822610","3823510"," How are you, my man?"
"3823890","3824830"," Good afternoon, my friend. "
"3826690","3827910"," I love that, bro."
"3828690","3829550"," I love Quinn."
"3830170","3833190"," P.E. and other kind of funds rolling up all sort of catch flowing businesses. "
"3833770","3836650"," Lisa Cook, Sarah Bloom, Chasmin."
"3837070","3840910"," Look, you look, you like Chia for long as which offices play, would you suggest?"
"3841990","3843150"," I'm in on SQ waiting."
"3843650","3845110"," Yeah, SQ is a good buy right now. "
"3847090","3848130"," Well, that's the thing."
"3848430","3849350"," So that's the thing."
"3849550","3850730"," Here's the key on SQ, okay?"
"3851450","3852450"," We need to address SQ. "
"3853090","3854830"," So you're going to look for a couple of things."
"3856070","3860230"," You're looking for, you're looking for a few things, right?"
"3860710","3867330"," Where, when you look at that ER, you know that ER is going to be, hello, Henry."
"3868070","3868730"," How are you doing, little buddy?"
"3869450","3870090"," Hello, good boy. "
"3870890","3870970"," Hi."
"3871710","3872610"," Do you want side plan in the snow?"
"3873410","3874050"," You're a good boy."
"3874910","3876270"," All right, all right, go ahead. "
"3876890","3878410"," You want the backscratch, don't you?"
"3878650","3879230"," You want to cuddle?"
"3881590","3890710"," So if you're looking at the thing you didn't understand about SQ is that it had a bad ER."
"3891110","3898030"," No matter what you want to think about it or whatever, bad ER, the implication is that Apple's not"
"3898030","3899330"," giving them the money they want."
"3899430","3901690"," I think, is that what SQ was or is that PayPal?"
"3902730","3904110"," Okay, I remember what SQ's problem was. "
"3905670","3907650"," I think it was, I think SQ was the same."
"3908290","3909250"," I could be wrong on this."
"3910810","3911510"," I'm trying to remember. "
"3911650","3913310"," It was a snap that was having problems with Apple."
"3914830","3917210"," And okay, so we're looking at spy right now."
"3917250","3920290"," Nothing big going on in spy or so that we can see yet. "
"3921230","3923110"," I can't remember exactly what SQ's issue was."
"3925370","3927370"," I think it might have just been taking profit."
"3927850","3931050"," But you guys remember what, I can't remember what SQ's issue was. "
"3931490","3932750"," But the key is that a bad ER, right?"
"3932870","3935030"," Or they had bad news, I remember, it was like bad, bad news."
"3935590","3943050"," So you end up getting SQ trading down from the original trade and SQ, which was back in 2020,"
"3943410","3943470"," right?"
"3943590","3947170"," March, we had the SQ trade start and these banks want to take profit out of it."
"3948430","3951870"," But let's say you have this ER, people want to do an ER run up on SQ. "
"3952510","3953890"," So you're going to see a ton of calls coming in SQ."
"3954490","3959090"," You know that it's going to trade down because they had some previous bad news into ER."
"3959490","3961990"," You want to see a solution before you go along it. "
"3961990","3966110"," But then you want to look at where all the concentration of calls are in SQ."
"3966690","3968590"," Are they just prior to ER?"
"3969150","3970350"," Are they the week after ER?"
"3970830","3971830"," Are they two weeks after ER?"
"3972350","3977490"," Because typically what you'll see is like a great ER, you'll see the stock continue to go down."
"3978610","3982130"," Just enough that it doesn't print puts, it doesn't print calls. "
"3982890","3985390"," Everyone that's loaded up on calls, everyone that's loaded up on puts."
"3986890","3988550"," And you have the interest fall off."
"3989390","3991570"," Even if it's good ER, your interest fall off. "
"3992730","3993790"," And then it rips higher."
"3995250","4003250"," So how to combat that is before the ER run, you just buy some call spreads."
"4003790","4005730"," You don't have to deal with the interest. "
"4006450","4012030"," You don't have to deal with worrying about if you're going to gain the premium from the interest in"
"4012030","4015270"," call buying and SQ, in case they keep dumping it over just trade sideways."
"4016210","4018310"," But you're able to capture both."
"4018790","4021610"," You can capture SQ if it goes up prior to ER. "
"4022250","4025110"," And you can also capture, and you can get out of your trade at that point."
"4025670","4028990"," Or you can wait until ER date, if it's trading down."
"4029350","4034810"," Pick up the call spreads right then and there for like a month after or two weeks after and capture"
"4034810","4035270"," that trade. "
"4040400","4042820"," So you also got, Quinn, my brother."
"4046600","4050480"," Thanks to the heads up, Quinn saying SQ 11 November 16th."
"4051120","4053860"," It looks like a 116 11 1601. "
"4054560","4055440"," Not quite getting that."
"4056740","4061660"," 05 Susquehanna adjust blocks price target to 275 from 300 got it."
"4064240","4065900"," Yeah, please smash that like button. "
"4068780","4070720"," Bio got murked all of last year."
"4070820","4072020"," How can it cool down even more?"
"4072480","4077100"," Oh, I'm not talking about, I'm not talking about biotech, easy on the biotech trade."
"4077580","4082780"," I'm talking about, I'm not talking about biotech getting crushed for the rest of the year or"
"4082780","4083400"," anything like that. "
"4083880","4089280"," If you guys want me to go back to XBI and show you that it's trading sideways right now, it's"
"4089280","4090500"," got more sellers than buyers that can."
"4091000","4091520"," It's easy."
"4091780","4094360"," I'm not trying to beat up on your on your trade at all. "
"4098859","4101880"," You have black, Jack Dorsey changed the name to block."
"4104350","4109529"," Yeah, they get some, they get some really weird stuff going on with their counting is funny too."
"4110290","4116390"," Like they, how they, how they, how they account for their gains is slightly absurd. "
"4118790","4122200"," I've never liked their accounting practices."
"4125010","4125930"," Okay, hold on."
"4126569","4127590"," Henry, what was your post?"
"4129800","4132660"," Henry, I'm looking, Henry, I'm looking for you brother. "
"4135439","4136840"," My dog came in, Henry."
"4138200","4142220"," Hey cap, have you used the book map that has integrated on Thinkorswim platform?"
"4143160","4144819"," No, so I have Thinkorswim."
"4146439","4153100"," The book map on Thinkorswim is not the same as the actual book map platform. "
"4153100","4160640"," Oh, you've got much less information on Thinkorswim and I think you have less tickers too."
"4163870","4166790"," Quinn, some of the bears are hoping to see Mara."
"4167410","4170810"," If you have people dropping the same ticker more than once, just skip this one though. "
"4171410","4174490"," I'll put Mara up real quick for you, Quinn, always my brother."
"4176970","4180410"," So yeah, the book map on Thinkorswim is not the same book."
"4180529","4182250"," It's like a, it's like book map light. "
"4182250","4187370"," Maybe you can pay for extra things on book map for Thinkorswim."
"4187390","4188370"," I know they have a free version."
"4190510","4196250"," If you're using it to trade SPY, I guess you could run it against what I've got up here. "
"4196610","4199530"," I don't know if you can get the Hero Indicator for Thinkorswim."
"4199690","4201210"," I'm assuming you can get it as an add-on."
"4203990","4208050"," We got bears on Mara, who I wouldn't be to bearish on Mara, not yet. "
"4210410","4212410"," So let's see, we've got support and resistance on Mara."
"4214450","4224250"," It looks like the trade Mara right now is centered around big by the dips at 30.08."
"4225310","4236470"," You've got Intraday support at 31.03. Your price target is 34.90. Is"
"4236470","4237770"," that the question that you had, Henry?"
"4239010","4240090"," I'm looking, Henry."
"4243160","4254720"," You know, and if you're trading just the SPY, I would assume that I would assume that you"
"4254720","4258860"," guys think I'm beating up on an XPI?"
"4259300","4260080"," I don't hate XPI. "
"4260740","4262000"," I love the biotech trade."
"4272100","4274420"," I think we traded biotech like a week ago, right?"
"4274600","4274940"," Two weeks ago?"
"4275740","4276600"," Something like that."
"4277200","4279240"," I do like an XPI, you've got the three. "
"4279620","4281120"," So this is a good time to look."
"4281360","4283340"," So let's go back to XPI real quick."
"4283980","4286960"," If you guys open up XPI in your own charts, right?"
"4288700","4291280"," This is almost where the turn is on XPI. "
"4291840","4296400"," You've got one test, two tests, and three tests, right?"
"4297040","4301780"," You've got some seriously trapped sellers, and you still have heavy selling right now on XPI."
"4304850","4309570"," And you could be setting up, to an extent, a very bullish pattern here on XPI."
"4313320","4320860"," So I charted out XPI on Twitter, and I said that the buy the F&DIP, you're ready for my"
"4320860","4323020"," price, I posted this on Twitter. "
"4323540","4330640"," My buy the dip on Twitter was 97.43, and we're down to 110 right now, 24."
"4332160","4335180"," You might get another Ripper up here, but you'll get manipulation."
"4336040","4338060"," You'll get manipulation down here at these levels. "
"4339120","4344540"," You'll trade within a zone, and then you'll have this one swoop down, and then you'll swoop back"
"4344540","4344780"," up."
"4345920","4347280"," From that, capitulation move."
"4347640","4356560"," And then what it does is it shakes out call buyers, panic sellers of the underlying security or"
"4356560","4358420"," shares. "
"4360750","4364990"," And I do think we see 97.44 on XPI."
"4366530","4372770"," I think for a brief moment, for like 20 minutes on one part of a day, you're going to see"
"4372770","4381150"," between 97.44 and 87.73. And I want to buy that all day long."
"4384820","4385180"," Let's see. "
"4388480","4389420"," Some of us bears."
"4389880","4391720"," Yeah, I wouldn't be too bearish tomorrow right now."
"4395920","4396400"," Tickets. "
"4397040","4399360"," Is there a buying program in Spy?"
"4400100","4401740"," Let's go back to Spy real quick."
"4401740","4402880"," Omar's got a big question."
"4404160","4405660"," Big supporter of the channel. "
"4407320","4409560"," We'll do Omar."
"4410480","4411980"," Once Spy back up, we'll do that."
"4415830","4418290"," Two January monthly calls work for these tickers. "
"4419070","4423610"," Try to get, if you're going to buy tickers that are having an ER coming up, you either want to"
"4423610","4427190"," be, you either want to be sell, you think about two things, right?"
"4427810","4433050"," You're trying to, if you're trying to catch the premium, you want to be buying expirations that are"
"4433050","4434430"," weak to two weeks out."
"4435130","4437770"," Wherever the interest is growing in that ticker."
"4439430","4444510"," So that, so that people want to buy them from you, right?"
"4446820","4448160"," Nope, still have more sellers. "
"4448520","4451580"," You have more calls than puts right now on Spy."
"4455440","4458220"," So the call, the calls is what's doing it right now."
"4465660","4467440"," See, we're on the second right now on Spy. "
"4470350","4472410"," This is working out so much better than before."
"4484520","4484980"," Think tight here."
"4487570","4498840"," Got 2,000 calls, settings, figure add-ons, intervals, 50,"
"4500800","4504660"," let's try 50 on the intervals, and then go lower. "
"4505720","4506960"," Let's see what that looks like."
"4511570","4518900"," Get price targets still, still 480, and as we get closer to, we'll check the, we're going to check"
"4518900","4523920"," the right around, right around 130 this afternoon and another hour, we're going to check to see"
"4523920","4533420"," where everyone's positioned in the Spy, and then we'll take a trade for FMC meeting minutes, or at"
"4533420","4533920"," least I will."
"4538200","4538920"," Beware of SQ. "
"4540800","4542720"," SQ is February 3rd or 2nd."
"4545540","4547520"," Can you look at AMBA?"
"4547580","4548640"," Yeah, I can look at AMBA."
"4549000","4553060"," Yeah, that trade for Spy is definitely going to be right around 130 this afternoon. "
"4554080","4556280"," I think I could be wrong, I could miss it."
"4557640","4565560"," AMBA, so some of us said AMBA, AMBA."
"4582290","4585670"," Is the microphone working so far?"
"4586810","4588070"," Is this a better microphone?"
"4588330","4589850"," Should I turn the game down?"
"4591010","4592150"," Ooh, AMBA. "
"4594150","4595610"," Who's it, who called that one out?"
"4598030","4598510"," Guacada."
"4599690","4601230"," Nice shout out, Guacada."
"4602470","4603290"," I likey. "
"4604370","4609650"," You still have slightly more sellers, it looks like them buyers, but I do like the support level."
"4610530","4611230"," Let's look at this one."
"4612650","4613130"," AMBA. "
"4628250","4629370"," How long is AMBA?"
"4629590","4630110"," Ooh, I don't know."
"4631210","4632910"," A trade's been going on, bro, since."
"4635290","4642270"," A trade's been going on since October 30th, 2020. "
"4643370","4648930"," It went from 58 dollars to 227."
"4649770","4652310"," I'd say that they're taking profit if you really want to know."
"4653110","4655110"," I'd be bearish on this stock. "
"4656670","4657690"," Could be bearish here."
"4659390","4660750"," Even if there is support here."
"4661550","4664450"," I guess you could do the seller-ups and buy the dips. "
"4665810","4670290"," There you go right there's 140."
"4671110","4672970"," Do you see where some real buyers are?"
"4674350","4674670"," 140."
"4678820","4680420"," Be careful of AMBA, bro. "
"4681260","4683580"," You guys, how many of you guys out there?"
"4683700","4685100"," I want to ask a serious question of you guys."
"4685100","4687460"," I look at the queues real quick."
"4687580","4688600"," I know you guys wanted to see the queues. "
"4689040","4691040"," Then I look at Tesla and then I'll see what else you guys are asking."
"4691400","4693200"," I'll ask you guys a serious question, okay?"
"4693940","4701120"," Do some of you people really think that that you're making the stock go up?"
"4701460","4705860"," Like, do you guys really think that the other ones buying the stock and so the price of the stock"
"4705860","4706400"," is going up?"
"4708740","4710240"," There's retail influences."
"4712780","4716380"," Somewhat, well not all stocks, but there are stocks that are influenced by retail, right?"
"4716800","4721120"," They get coverage, let's say you're getting coverage on social media, you're getting coverage in"
"4721120","4721460"," the news. "
"4722200","4725960"," Get some great PR and hype out there for a company."
"4726440","4728960"," What happens is you get like an old man like me."
"4729520","4733420"," I talked to my broker and I said, I'm not my broker, but I'm my fund manager and I'm like,"
"4734020","4736840"," hey can you, you know everybody's talking about SQ right now. "
"4737140","4738820"," Let's start a trade on SQ right."
"4740480","4742000"," Whatever one you like, you pick it."
"4748340","4756560"," You got buyers down below at 390.36. Next target below is 380.20. It's a pretty big fall. "
"4757200","4760160"," You'll probably see that on the 10th, 380."
"4761040","4762020"," Remember that number, okay?"
"4763940","4766360"," But you're at a localized bottom right now on the queues."
"4767120","4772040"," So I want to ask you guys a question because you know it's not that it's not that we don't"
"4772040","4774180"," influence the hype in a stock. "
"4774940","4781220"," But you have to remember that the stock is moved by banks and hedge funds, okay?"
"4782180","4787760"," So these banks, there is some support that grows over the years."
"4788480","4791160"," Right, let's say we get a stock that starts at 10 bucks."
"4792800","4800180"," And let's say, you know, it's gone up for two straight years from $10 to $100 or $500, 500 is"
"4800180","4801160"," a more realistic expectation. "
"4801680","4807880"," Like 400% gain out of stock is a more realistic expectation for most stocks."
"4808120","4808900"," But you can go higher and lower."
"4809340","4814200"," The point is this, if a bank takes up a stock in 10 bucks to 100 bucks, let's say it"
"4814200","4814860"," takes two years. "
"4815580","4819700"," You should only expect after two years, let's say 30, 40, 50, right?"
"4820580","4826740"," But you are going to expect, I don't know what the, it's an arbitrary number."
"4826740","4832480"," But the key is this, that when you see a bank that's moving a stock, and they move that stock"
"4832480","4840660"," 400%, 500%, and you start to see it trade down heavily, you have to remember that these banks want"
"4840660","4846160"," to take profit in these companies, and that they will make up bullshit excuses, bullshit reasons,"
"4846820","4851560"," they'll make up anything under the sun to tell you why it's selling down, and they'll take their"
"4851560","4851920"," profit."
"4852460","4856680"," No matter what you want to do, no matter what you think is going to happen, no matter how good"
"4856680","4859860"," the news is, they want to take profit off of these trades. "
"4860740","4868580"," And so when I'm looking over here at AMBA, the AMBA trade started on October of 2020."
"4869100","4872740"," It went from $62 to $227."
"4873540","4874500"," That's almost 400%. "
"4875080","4877980"," Like, are you expecting a bank to say, no, I'm not taking profit?"
"4878840","4880580"," Do you think this is retail traders doing this too?"
"4880760","4881840"," Because it's not, well, some of them are."
"4882540","4885580"," So you have to remember where they start that trade, right?"
"4885780","4887620"," Remember, I took the trade at 60 bucks."
"4888320","4892920"," I took it all the way up to 220 bucks, they're going to take profit, and then think about what's"
"4892920","4895540"," fair value if it was at 60 bucks?"
"4895940","4898260"," What's fair value a year and a half later?"
"4899380","4901440"," And it probably, what is it, what is it probably at?"
"4902100","4907840"," Fair value after a year later, 80 bucks, 100 bucks, max, 100 bucks, probably 80 bucks. "
"4908620","4913380"," And this cycle goes on every single year, it goes on, I've seen it for years."
"4913720","4916680"," We're trading for so long, and every year you hear the same thing from people."
"4916980","4919440"," And it has nothing to do with if the company's good or bad or whatever. "
"4919840","4924520"," Unless they're committing fraud, or unless they're going to become absorbed by another company, if"
"4924520","4928960"," they're going to be bought by another company, if they're going to go bankrupt, some kind of like"
"4928960","4935100"," the 10 deadly sins of the stock market, unless they're going to get corporate takeover, they're"
"4935100","4936280"," going to merge, something like that."
"4937180","4939120"," You're not going to see them trade that low."
"4939420","4940900"," Or excuse me, you're not going to see them recover. "
"4941560","4943680"," You're going to see the profit be taken in that company."
"4944220","4948060"," You'll see that company trade down to where it was originally."
"4948440","4953720"," You can actually usually chart these things out and figure out what would be natural growth on that"
"4953720","4954120"," company. "
"4955900","4957080"," Yeah, and you can see it."
"4957580","4959860"," Right now it's like $108 on AMBA."
"4960160","4966660"," So the point I'm trying to say to you is that you, if you're jumping in an AMBA you timed"
"4966660","4967040"," it wrong. "
"4967500","4971560"," What you want to be finding, when you guys are, you guys just called off a bunch of stocks to"
"4971560","4977500"," me earlier this morning, what you guys want to be looking for are stocks that are hitting certain"
"4977500","4978880"," metrics, right?"
"4979260","4980420"," They recently IPO'd."
"4980700","4983460"," They're making 30% year over year."
"4984020","4992720"," Every single last nine, last eight, last six ERs are very positive for guidance, kick ass ER"
"4992720","4995440"," statements, and they're growing, right?"
"4995440","4996860"," They're just growing and booming. "
"4997380","5002080"," And you want to see that the banks and hedge funds are just starting to move them now, right?"
"5002240","5004300"," So you want to see the banks pushing them."
"5004500","5006320"," They haven't grown 400% yet."
"5006440","5013520"," They're only up maybe like 60%, 40%, 30%, and you can base that on real true PE ratios. "
"5014040","5016240"," You can base that on real true growth estimates."
"5016900","5021640"," Instead of trying to catch knives, catch bags, they imagine having to wait for AMBA."
"5021640","5024000"," AMBA could take, how long to trade down?"
"5024340","5026160"," Six months, another six months, another year. "
"5026740","5030380"," When you're sitting around waiting on AMBA, you could have been making money on a company that's"
"5030380","5032840"," moving right now, okay?"
"5033340","5035720"," Like one of these companies, like you know where AMBA was?"
"5035960","5038440"," You know where AMBA was back in December of 2020?"
"5038920","5042860"," Or maybe where AMBA was back in August of 2021?"
"5044480","5047860"," That's where you want to be picking AMBA up, not when it's on the top of a cycle."
"5047860","5052640"," And that goes for, I guarantee that goes for 40% of this list that I have."
"5053040","5057640"," You know, that's not like knock on anybody or to shit on your stock or anything like that. "
"5057960","5063440"," But if we're in a new year, you want to be looking for what companies have these kick-ass"
"5063440","5068960"," projections have not been topped out yet at 300, 400%, and you want to make a basket of those"
"5068960","5076040"," stocks for 2022, and you want to start tracking them immediately so that you can be the first guy"
"5076040","5076240"," in."
"5076240","5081320"," So let's say you were a first guy on AMBA, let's say you bought AMBA at 60 bucks, right?"
"5083060","5086320"," Let's say you bought it at 60, 30, 40, 50, 60 bucks."
"5086560","5089040"," I mean, when I bought GME, I bought it at 25 bucks. "
"5089660","5093000"," I think I even bought it once at 15 for like a week or two, but then I went balls"
"5093000","5094860"," deep into it at 25 dollars."
"5095500","5098480"," When we were up cranking on GME, do you think I cared?"
"5099060","5100480"," I didn't care less, right?"
"5100640","5105820"," I was down there at low dollar cost average, and when I took my profit off that, I felt good."
"5105820","5111040"," It felt great, and it feels good when you're buying those stocks that are being moved in the early"
"5111040","5111560"," stages. "
"5123000","5123600"," Otis."
"5123600","5124580"," Otis, what are you guys?"
"5124960","5126020"," Joe, what are you going to do for you?"
"5128240","5130260"," CLF X just trucking today."
"5130640","5131800"," Let's hook those up, baby, for me. "
"5132340","5140940"," I like hearing that trucking along, trucking down New Orleans, trucking to Minnesota."
"5140940","5145760"," So, I've got to do a, what's it, what was it doing?"
"5146420","5147200"," It's not a presentation."
"5148380","5151080"," I got to do a trade show. "
"5152040","5152880"," Wait, what sucks."
"5154220","5158680"," Someone out there, one of you guys out there, I'm not going to name names, but one of those one"
"5158680","5165280"," of the subscribers here is at a trade show in Minnesota, Minnesota."
"5168400","5172760"," I told him to cut his hair like the Minnesota hockey players, like hockey hair, saw the chicks that"
"5172760","5173080"," dig them. "
"5176240","5179880"," I hope you're taking CLF a short, right?"
"5180540","5181840"," Taking a short and CLF."
"5182800","5183780"," Is that the plan?"
"5185960","5187300"," Oh, no, that's not the plan."
"5187860","5190060"," More buyers than sellers on CLF. "
"5191700","5192500"," It's a nice one."
"5192820","5194140"," Keep your eyes on this one, boys and girls."
"5195520","5203400"," CLF is breaking through resistance above, just bashing, just ripped through through some sellers at"
"5203400","5211160"," $24.58. It's got minor resistance at $24.93. And then you've got your next wall at $25.91. You"
"5211160","5217080"," do have almost double the buyers and sellers, and you have a positive heroin indicator. "
"5222040","5223400"," I should be a singer."
"5226820","5230180"," What's happening with spy and QQ, you spy plummeting."
"5230180","5232360"," Wait, didn't I just talk to you guys about this?"
"5232860","5237440"," Didn't I just tell you guys that the trade on spy is not until $130?"
"5240720","5242160"," You guys are funny as hell. "
"5242500","5243540"," I love all of you guys out."
"5243660","5246060"," You guys make me laugh my ass off every single morning or afternoon."
"5246880","5248360"," My puts are printing now. "
"5250580","5251880"," You guys are hilarious."
"5253660","5254720"," I'm doing that on VFF."
"5255680","5256960"," Dude, I swore I did Oracle. "
"5257620","5258920"," I didn't do Oracle yet, hutch."
"5259240","5260160"," Come on, brah."
"5260740","5263300"," All right, so we're pumping Oracle again. "
"5263560","5267720"," I'm going to get in trouble with the SDC for pumping stocks that don't move."
"5268200","5268700"," Just joking."
"5269720","5275380"," All right, Oracle, UVXY. "
"5275860","5278720"," You guys want me to chart out UVXY as a killing me?"
"5279340","5282680"," Let's look at spy and see how terrible it is."
"5283340","5284640"," What do you mean your puts are printing?"
"5285740","5287760"," You guys are killing me out there."
"5289060","5290660"," Oracle bashing into support. "
"5291360","5292100"," Okay, here's Oracle."
"5292100","5292880"," You guys want to see?"
"5293340","5294000"," Hard support."
"5294580","5296420"," $87, hard support. "
"5296780","5297820"," Just crashed into it."
"5298520","5299420"," Nice little dipper."
"5300320","5301700"," Price target, $89. "
"5303300","5305820"," Maybe even $89 to $91."
"5306240","5307320"," We're still trading this, right?"
"5308760","5310960"," $84 is the real BTFD."
"5311160","5319680"," Like the buy of the F&DIP is $85.14. If you see increased weakness into FMC at $130, I"
"5319680","5323900"," take that trade at $85.17. Take it to $90 or close to it. "
"5324980","5326400"," You guys copying this right here?"
"5326720","5327980"," Got a little bit of weakness right now."
"5328380","5330260"," Get some support being whittled away at."
"5330640","5336740"," You still have more buyers than Oracle right here, but definitely I'd look at like $130 PM or $2 PM"
"5336740","5342300"," for some weakness down to $85 and then take it up to $89 once again on Oracle. "
"5342580","5343300"," Good call out there, Hutch."
"5345630","5348690"," I think they're all dipping and doing that on VFF."
"5349270","5351450"," Yeah, I'm not trying to be pissed off of you guys or anything. "
"5352270","5356210"," Yeah, my first trade on Bloodstalk was at $15, I think."
"5356730","5357690"," Not quite $12."
"5360330","5362350"," I sold out my first trade there. "
"5362690","5366370"," I think it was at $40 or $50, and then I bought back in on a dip to $25."
"5373340","5379460"," Cuplet spot yesterday, $1.21, $3.80. Civilization is about to collapse."
"5379700","5380140"," I love you, Josh. "
"5380980","5381820"," I love you, my brother."
"5383180","5384860"," Josh, keep it coming."
"5386360","5388500"," I love that shit, brother. "
"5392620","5398810"," Yeah, thanks for coming back in the stream too, Josh."
"5399130","5399990"," I know you left the other day."
"5401870","5402990"," Don't leave the stream, bro. "
"5403890","5404890"," I like having you here."
"5405750","5406570"," I'm a bear, dude."
"5406890","5413190"," I start out as a bear, so I understand what you're saying about the market crash. "
"5413330","5413790"," I get there."
"5414170","5415930"," I get on the rabbit hole all the time and get freaked out."
"5416450","5417490"," I understand, man. "
"5418830","5425450"," The only question is, I like I back-tested, and I'm like, the only way that you can't figure out"
"5425450","5433030"," how to trade 2022 is if we crash to the same crash that we had in 1929."
"5435210","5443390"," And another thing was Game of Trades did a video yesterday, I think that was the same thesis that I"
"5443390","5443570"," have."
"5444330","5448330"," And what you'd really need to do is you'd have to have a draw down of the market, more than"
"5448330","5454170"," 50% for you to not be able to trade into profit in 2022. "
"5466820","5468400"," I'm trying to figure out what you guys are asking."
"5470420","5471980"," You guys want to see the queues once more?"
"5474500","5475780"," You guys have some puts out there."
"5477620","5479460"," Yeah, and don't fear. "
"5479600","5480180"," Trust me, guys."
"5480940","5485860"," Soon enough, I guarantee you within the next five days, you're going to see me with the bear suit"
"5485860","5486060"," on."
"5486640","5488600"," And we're going to trade this market down together too. "
"5488600","5496680"," So watch, you'll see all the bulls leave the channel, and then you'll see all the bears"
"5496680","5499300"," show up for a week."
"5503100","5505900"," Derek Kotonoy will grace us with his presence."
"5507600","5509760"," I'll have to apologize again, live on air. "
"5511180","5513660"," Let's look at some targets on the queues real quick."
"5513880","5514780"," Let me get this to load up."
"5520760","5521700"," Which video was that?"
"5526590","5528030"," Oh, yeah, the one about hockey here. "
"5528690","5535910"," So dude, in the early 2020s, if you're from Minnesota, they do this thing where all the hockey"
"5535910","5540970"," players make a video to raise money for youth hockey and shit like that."
"5541390","5543050"," These guys grow out some crazy haircuts."
"5543290","5544630"," They're not as crazy as they were. "
"5544770","5547270"," Now they're not as crazy as they were in the early 2000s."
"5547590","5549750"," If you look at the first few years, they did it."
"5550150","5554230"," These guys are growing out all kinds of crazy nonsense, like shaving the front of their heads. "
"5554810","5558730"," No, no, I forget, they would shave like the front of their heads and just leave the Alabama mud"
"5558730","5559530"," flaps in the back."
"5560090","5561630"," And they always crazy names for their haircuts."
"5564780","5565180"," Nice. "
"5566640","5567440"," Boy, Josh."
"5570390","5571550"," Nuclear war is imminent."
"5572090","5573170"," Global economic collapse. "
"5573610","5574150"," Protestors everywhere."
"5574590","5576450"," Mass uprisings by civilians against government."
"5577050","5578810"," There's not a single positive outlook for the world. "
"5580030","5580990"," I love it."
"5581950","5582930"," I love it."
"5584530","5585430"," Yeah, that's the key. "
"5586050","5587510"," That's what you guys should all know that, right?"
"5588230","5589290"," Yeah, you're going to get the bear skin to wear."
"5589610","5590350"," That is the key, right?"
"5590830","5592310"," Key is you can hold those viewpoints."
"5593710","5597910"," It's not that you can't hold a viewpoint like we're all up Schitt's Creek without a paddle. "
"5598730","5599930"," That's okay to hold that viewpoint."
"5600370","5601870"," I got nothing against that viewpoint at all."
"5602430","5603310"," Okay, you guys are looking up. "
"5603510","5607690"," If you guys are looking right now or watching the cues, right?"
"5607810","5609130"," You've got lots of sellers in the cues."
"5609670","5610930"," You've got a little bit of positive."
"5612930","5614610"," It's basically neutral on the hero indicator. "
"5615130","5616150"," It's not really showing a whole ton."
"5617450","5623450"," But if you are a bear, try to be taking some profit at 390-22, or so it might have"
"5623450","5624010"," already hit there."
"5624790","5633030"," And then you want to pick it back up again at, if you're still bearish at this level, you want"
"5633030","5636710"," to pick up more puts again at 389-51. "
"5636970","5642990"," You want to see a break below 399-51, grab another set of puts, and your next price target down"
"5642990","5643930"," from there would be 385."
"5645030","5647190"," But it does look like some pretty firm support at this point."
"5648710","5650090"," This looks normal. "
"5650650","5654870"," We trade down into the FOMC meeting minutes, and we trade sideways."
"5655950","5657630"," We wait for what comes out publicly."
"5658210","5660750"," If it's everything that we know, then we're good to go. "
"5661250","5665530"," If it's not everything that we know, then you're going to see a sell-down, right?"
"5667790","5671940"," The one difference that I would say to you is this."
"5672780","5679100"," The last three FOMC minutes, there were a ton of zero-day puts."
"5679580","5682320"," So we'll look at Spy real quick and see if they have any. "
"5689650","5691930"," And so this is concerning right here."
"5692110","5693470"," Do you want to say this is concerning?"
"5694210","5696950"," This is a moment of pause if you are a bull."
"5698030","5703950"," So we have January 5th, 478 calls. "
"5704850","5704870"," Okay?"
"5705490","5707470"," There's a concentration of them on the Spy."
"5708710","5710830"," They're 19 cents right now currently."
"5711650","5714210"," Most of the traders are in the call side. "
"5714650","5718630"," Now, the last three times we traded this, nobody was holding calls."
"5719170","5720510"," Everybody was holding puts."
"5721250","5723950"," Everybody said I was crazy for taking the call side. "
"5724330","5726530"," I was the only person out there taking the call side."
"5726930","5731330"," We printed 3,000 and 5,000 percent, and then another 1,000 percent."
"5732070","5739230"," Now, if everybody's not expecting bad news at this FOMC meeting minutes, and everybody's lopsided"
"5739230","5744070"," on the call side, heading into FOMC, maybe we take the put side trade around one o'clock. "
"5744850","5745790"," We got 10 more minutes."
"5746430","5749650"," We're going to see how much our bulls load up on this trade."
"5750790","5755950"," We're at 111,000 contracts interest on 478C. "
"5757210","5760610"," And they're down to 18 cents for January 5th."
"5761390","5766190"," So I might take the contrarian trade on this FOMC meeting minutes and take the put side."
"5769880","5774820"," The 473s are 15 cents. "
"5775660","5777100"," Let me look at the spy real quick."
"5788550","5790670"," Yeah, that 473 trade on the spy."
"5797840","5801410"," 473P dirt cheap puts. "
"5801770","5805850"," Dirt cheap contrarian trade."
"5806090","5808470"," Last three times I've traded FOMC meeting minutes."
"5809030","5814590"," I traded the call side because everybody and their sister knew that we were going down. "
"5815110","5817790"," And right now everybody and their sister knows we're going up."
"5824880","5825960"," Be easy on my boy Josh."
"5826180","5826660"," I'm gonna air friends. "
"5829810","5830950"," Josh is cool as hell."
"5834390","5835490"," Josh is the man."
"5835710","5837190"," Like he lends really good. "
"5837850","5838810"," He's awesome."
"5839570","5841030"," And I love his place posts are rad."
"5855180","5857920"," Everyone knows that nothing crazy is coming out of the minutes. "
"5858760","5859720"," Everybody knows."
"5860800","5862860"," Why do I want to go the opposite direction?"
"5863700","5868670"," What's the logic here buying wave at 230?"
"5869250","5870350"," Yeah, Hutch kind of has it."
"5871570","5872010"," Kinda. "
"5874070","5875050"," Yeah, it's Max Payne."
"5878680","5881420"," Yes, this is FOMC for December."
"5884540","5886840"," Yeah, you guys should listen to what I say on an all honesty. "
"5887300","5887740"," That's true."
"5889800","5891700"," So I just took the trade."
"5892080","5893640"," I took the opposite. "
"5894020","5896200"," So you got to remember last three FOMCs, right?"
"5896440","5897460"," I took the opposite trade."
"5898560","5900000"," Everybody and I mean everybody."
"5900860","5903140"," Every I got the I still have the tweets. "
"5904120","5905720"," I made the trades before."
"5906760","5909140"," The FOMC minutes and meetings."
"5910260","5914320"," And I made a lot of money because nobody was on the on the call side. "
"5914320","5915120"," And I mean nobody."
"5916220","5918680"," And everybody right now is on the call side."
"5919140","5921140"," And of the of the minutes. "
"5921480","5924100"," Normally the FOMC minutes are no are nothing burger."
"5924400","5924940"," They're nothing."
"5925480","5926860"," They mean nothing to go straight up. "
"5926860","5927660"," Every month."
"5933660","5937300"," Everyone has positioned to the upside because there won't be any change in the verbiage."
"5937760","5940000"," Omar, you couldn't have said it any better. "
"5942420","5944180"," I don't think that's true cap."
"5945160","5946480"," I really hope you're wrong."
"5946680","5947820"," Ooh, I've heard that many times. "
"5949800","5951280"," How many times have I heard that?"
"5951980","5952880"," I hope you're right."
"5953100","5953920"," I hope you're wrong cap."
"5957840","5958560"," You got it. "
"5958740","5960480"," So it's always funny how this stuff works out."
"5960480","5962760"," It has more to do with everybody being long."
"5964300","5968520"," Has more to do with, you know, when everybody knows something's going to happen. "
"5969340","5971280"," And everybody knows something's going to happen."
"5971740","5978420"," Every time you guys see like, you guys always see like, uh, you guys always see like, well, it was"
"5978420","5978920"," Selva news."
"5980180","5981400"," You know, that's my favorite. "
"5981600","5984040"," It was Selva news or it was unknown."
"5984080","5984940"," So it's going up."
"5985160","5987640"," My other favorite is it should be going up right now. "
"5987680","5989800"," Why is it going up or why is it going down right now?"
"5990700","5994340"," It's usually has some more to do with the mechanics of the options market."
"6000890","6005870"," Deeper insight into the meeting where they pivoted more outwardly hawkish."
"6006610","6007850"," That's not a great one, AV for me. "
"6008970","6009430"," Does that go heavy?"
"6009650","6010490"," No, I'm waiting here."
"6010650","6011350"," I got eight more minutes."
"6011570","6013390"," Then I'm going to get in some training here. "
"6015630","6016570"," Eight more minutes."
"6018110","6019930"," You have some buying coming in on."
"6020850","6021510"," So we're going to watch. "
"6021670","6023310"," I want you guys to watch this together with me, okay?"
"6023810","6026410"," So what we're going to do is I want you guys to open up the chart, the spy chart."
"6027110","6030890"," Open up right now and find out which side the traders really are on."
"6032980","6035400"," We want to see where the banks, which side the banks are on. "
"6035800","6039600"," So we're going to watch the book map, right?"
"6040000","6041880"," And we're going to see we're bouncing right now in the spy."
"6045430","6047410"," And we're going to see what the real trade is coming up."
"6052560","6055500"," We want to see where the real trade is right now coming into FMC minutes. "
"6055920","6059000"," Is there a trade on FMC minutes?"
"6059600","6061180"," That might go the call side, but we'll wait and see."
"6061180","6068640"," So we do have buyers stepping in on spy right now, just heads up."
"6069120","6070740"," We've got more buyers than sellers. "
"6071100","6073300"," We've got the call calls are going through the charts."
"6076300","6078720"," Let me get the live trade here with you guys right now."
"6096730","6099430"," It's neck and neck right now with buyers and sellers on spy. "
"6100190","6103910"," We do have some heavy call option flow coming in right now."
"6104410","6114390"," The calls are we're down to 18 cents for a moment on the those 18 cents for 78 calls."
"6116110","6119010"," We're 18 cents a few moments ago, they're now up to 21 cents. "
"6119310","6120390"," They were 20 cents a minute ago."
"6125000","6127500"," I guess what you really could do is you could take both trades."
"6128920","6130840"," But you have to trade more than 100%. "
"6131620","6141340"," We could trade the January 5th, 478 C's, put a buy in for like 18 cents."
"6142680","6147140"," And then buy the 473 P's at 14 cents."
"6149140","6150300"," Feeling both, what's that?"
"6151120","6153320"," 14 plus 18 is 42 cents. "
"6154160","6159840"," So you'd have to make roughly 20 cents on whichever side you trade."
"6160640","6162840"," Less than that, you'd have to make like 30 or no."
"6163540","6169600"," It's make like 15 cents, cut the other ones loose and ride the other ones into the close. "
"6173080","6174340"," Zach Burton right out of my brother."
"6174900","6176120"," Zach, I appreciate the tip."
"6177120","6182420"," Really appreciate the support of the channel, support of the sub, this is a free sub if you're a"
"6182420","6182840"," poor trader. "
"6183880","6185920"," I don't want any of your money, just like and subscribe."
"6186500","6191520"," If you guys are making money or not losing money by following me on this sub."
"6192440","6195940"," Yeah, if you guys are learning how to trade better, if you guys are not losing as much money as"
"6195940","6200400"," you were before, or if you're making money, we are trading below the VWAP right now. "
"6200780","6204100"," We do have more buyers stepping in, but it looks like it's even Steven right now."
"6204540","6207000"," It looks like VWAP is at 476 to 7116."
"6210110","6217890"," I know I've paid for subs, I've paid 600 to 1,000 bucks for subs, and I've had random three"
"6217890","6219130"," or four really horrible things. "
"6219790","6223310"," First thing I ran into was traders that were cryptic."
"6223530","6225270"," They didn't really tell you what they were doing."
"6225630","6226990"," You couldn't understand what they were saying. "
"6227410","6229210"," If you ask too many questions, you get yelled at."
"6230790","6232850"," Oftentimes, they won't tell you what their trade is, right?"
"6232970","6234990"," They'll tell you everything up into what they're actually trading."
"6235490","6237030"," So you don't know if you just take the trade or not. "
"6237030","6241130"," So you don't know how to actually learn how to execute, how to enter an exit trades, when to exit"
"6241130","6244710"," and then trades, when to roll, when to add, when to dump."
"6245890","6250950"," And then another thing they learned was that they weren't targeting certain stocks or certain"
"6250950","6251850"," trends for a day."
"6253090","6255270"," So it was kind of like lost right, always lost in the woods. "
"6256690","6260630"," Other times, I just never got any extra information that was legit, right?"
"6260810","6262090"," It was like they're pumping, right?"
"6262230","6264970"," You're pumping in a boiler room or in a trading room."
"6268780","6270760"," Yeah, and then I'm paying a ton of money."
"6270940","6273220"," You would pay an 800 bucks, 600 bucks, 1,000 bucks. "
"6273220","6274000"," That's some serious money."
"6274440","6277900"," I want like actionable trades if I'm paying that much money in a sub."
"6278880","6279780"," I'm not going to lie. "
"6280100","6280920"," And that's the truth, right?"
"6281080","6281600"," We all know this."
"6283840","6285440"," If you're going to pay 800 bucks in a month."
"6289000","6290260"," All right, so let's see what's going on. "
"6290640","6291620"," We have some spy sellers."
"6291840","6292720"," I'm Darkpool right now."
"6293080","6296020"," We have some Palantir puts coming in. "
"6296440","6300500"," We've got some American Airlines, Delta Airlines puts coming in."
"6300500","6302780"," Qcom just got a bid just heads up."
"6302840","6304020"," Where was trading Qcom out there?"
"6304400","6307460"," January 7th, 195c for $73,000. "
"6310660","6314520"," And I'm looking for, we got more buyers and sellers right now."
"6317660","6319720"," Hotchas saying some say RK leading indicator."
"6321240","6322400"," Yeah, 32 cents. "
"6322640","6326800"," Yeah, but if you let's say you cut the put side or the call side loose, you'd still save another"
"6326800","6327860"," few pennies to Quinn."
"6329120","6330460"," It's like 32 cents."
"6332820","6333400"," Where are you wrote?"
"6333560","6333980"," Where are we Rome?"
"6334500","6336220"," I hope I gave you a shout out earlier. "
"6336980","6338860"," Oh, I see what you're saying where we Rome."
"6339000","6339900"," I might not have seen that tip."
"6340080","6341160"," Thank you very much for your support. "
"6343570","6345390"," Need spy to come up for my call hold yesterday."
"6345570","6346910"," Captain, you check UPSC."
"6347450","6349030"," Yes, I can. "
"6349170","6351270"," I just can't check it at this exact moment."
"6351630","6353170"," We're going to try and enter a trade right now."
"6353670","6356050"," We're going to see where the trade is on the spy. "
"6357110","6363090"," You know, I'll put it up in the background, UPST. Do you need UPST right now?"
"6363390","6363690"," Can you wait?"
"6363990","6366130"," Is it if it's time sensitive?"
"6366330","6366670"," Let me know."
"6367250","6368170"," Hotch, and I'll put it up. "
"6370980","6373320"," I want you guys to see what's developing right here."
"6373720","6375220"," Just the heads up to all of you out there, okay?"
"6375720","6377280"," You see this resistance up here?"
"6378460","6381840"," 476.51. This is new on the spy, okay?"
"6382420","6384300"," Be real conscious of this right here."
"6385680","6389120"," Do you see that resistance forming on the spy right now?"
"6391460","6393520"," Be conscious of this right now, okay guys?"
"6395720","6397180"," I want you to see this right here. "
"6397880","6399500"," You see this push down right here?"
"6399840","6401160"," Be real careful right here, okay?"
"6402380","6403400"," Real, real careful."
"6405440","6407200"," And we have almost even."
"6407520","6409120"," We have way more calls coming in right now. "
"6409220","6410780"," We've got a bull's just..."
"6412080","6413460"," Yeah, I'm not trusting this."
"6413620","6415540"," I'm not trusting the call side on this right now."
"6417100","6417640"," At all. "
"6418580","6419840"," I'm going to take the put side on this."
"6427510","6429290"," There are buyers stepping in below it."
"6429490","6432570"," 47, 570, but I don't like this up here. "
"6432670","6434070"," I don't like these sellers coming in above."
"6434870","6435810"," This is not normal."
"6436550","6438810"," This has a heads up, okay?"
"6440290","6442330"," Be real careful here bulls. "
"6449140","6452280"," Those 473 calls or puts are now up to 18 cents."
"6472260","6472980"," Dirty bear."
"6473380","6474240"," No, I'm a dirty bear. "
"6475780","6476760"," Will you say it, Hutch?"
"6477120","6477600"," No, I can wait."
"6477780","6479600"," Okay, if you can't wait, I'll put it up right now."
"6480600","6483120"," Yeah, if you get both, then you don't have to sweat anything, right?"
"6483880","6492740"," If you pick up some cheap puts, 473Ps and then grab some 478s or 478, yeah, 478s. "
"6494930","6496070"," You can swing both."
"6501050","6502890"," Yep, spy might just get pinned, I agree."
"6503030","6504330"," I think the spy is pinned. "
"6505570","6506790"," I think that..."
"6506790","6508010"," I think that the..."
"6508010","6513710"," Well, see XLE XLF or XLI going up and XLF going up is not positive."
"6514590","6522750"," That's lending itself towards the tapering and rate discussion."
"6530100","6531820"," So I'm going to look to enter here in just a few moments. "
"6563340","6565800"," The call side just keeps going up and up."
"6587720","6589980"," Give me that last little capitulation down there."
"6597390","6599670"," I'll tell you guys exactly when I buy what I'm buying. "
"6605530","6606830"," Just a second here."
"6607730","6608650"," Let me bring up a..."
"6623240","6624700"," Did you guys see..."
"6624700","6628220"," You guys got a tax cuts for middle class New Yorkers?"
"6633660","6637520"," White House says over the past 10 years, large tech platforms are getting an unfair leg up on"
"6637520","6638160"," smaller competitors."
"6640880","6644080"," White House says, strong anti-trust laws are good for tech industry. "
"6645580","6648520"," Yeah, I'm afraid that's going to become news again, right?"
"6648700","6652040"," That's going to be the vehicle that's going to knock a big tech down."
"6654620","6657060"," Okay, so I'm probably going to go on the call side here."
"6658160","6660320"," The put side's gaining some weight. "
"6660930","6661900"," Gaining some weight."
"6679120","6681360"," 15.16 cents."
"6681980","6697800"," Give me that 4.74. Give me that 4.74. What is"
"6697800","6698520"," going on here?"
"6702020","6703700"," 15 cents on calls. "
"6710370","6711830"," Ask him for here."
"6719500","6729380"," So I put a buy order in for 15 cents on January 5th spy"
"6729380","6729740"," calls."
"6730680","6732460"," It dipped down there for just a second. "
"6733340","6736720"," So I want to see if it swings back down if we get that little bit of capitulation."
"6740060","6749980"," And if we get some weakness down at 15 cents and let it kicks down like 10 cents, I'll roll"
"6749980","6752080"," into even cheaper options."
"6753500","6756140"," Let's say it rolls down to 15 cents, I'll roll down. "
"6756460","6759020"," I'll add more at 10 cents and 8 cents to that kind of thing."
"6762500","6769800"," So on the call side on 4.78 C because of the weakness that's showing into the 1 o'clock"
"6769800","6770080"," hour."
"6781100","6783380"," And if I'm seeing minutes at 2 o'clock, right?"
"6784100","6784500"," I get that right. "
"6785240","6786760"," Make sure I got my times right here."
"6789100","6792120"," Is that 2 p.m.? Economic calendar."
"6799760","6801040"," I might be able to get them cheaper. "
"6803240","6805480"," And if I was sees, I might have misspoke."
"6805660","6812920"," I meant 130, not 1 p.m. So I might take, I'm going to cancel that order."
"6814720","6817680"," So canceling this order, give it a little bit. "
"6817680","6848400"," We'll wait until 130 to put the calls on and ride this"
"6848400","6848580"," up."
"6856740","6865710"," If you'll get my 4.74. I might just start buying right now"
"6865710","6869920"," and then add to the position."
"6870500","6884270"," All right, so"
"6884270","6887330"," I'm going to, I wanted 15 cents. "
"6887530","6888530"," I got 17 cents."
"6891210","6892270"," I'll add to them."
"6893330","6896950"," I'll add to them if we get down to like, we can get down to like 15 cents, 10 cents. "
"6897530","6898430"," I'll just start adding blocks."
"6908110","6909450"," So let me know out there."
"6909550","6910150"," Are you guys scared?"
"6911350","6913970"," As are you guys scared selling and buying dips?"
"6917410","6919470"," 478, no 477 by then. "
"6922290","6925090"," Yeah, Ben, that's the key on spy man."
"6925370","6927990"," The implied, the implied range today was what?"
"6927990","6931010"," It was hello, implied range today."
"6932950","6947240"," Back here"
"6947240","6947500"," soon. "
"6980260","6989610"," Ah, no, so your gamma flip is not on, so your gamma flip, I'm scared that the dip will keep"
"6989610","6990330"," dipping hilarious."
"6991310","6993710"," So you don't have gamma flip."
"6994050","6996370"," You don't have gamma turn at 4750. "
"6997370","7000450"," You have volatility at 4750."
"7002740","7008120"," And I think I read that this morning on SG and that's a, they were, they are wrong."
"7008620","7010220"," Sometimes they're, they're morning notes. "
"7010680","7012940"," Sometimes their notes are not accurate."
"7014700","7018140"," Your gamma flip on spy right now is where?"
"7020120","7021620"," Where is the gamma flip on spy?"
"7027840","7029660"," Yeah, the gamma flips below 470."
"7030740","7032820"," You're bullish from 470 and above. "
"7035860","7037540"," So that's where your gamma flip is."
"7041620","7043640"," Yeah, 470 is the gamma flip."
"7046670","7052990"," And that's where you, so you encounter volatility between 4750 and 4700. "
"7053650","7060490"," If you break through 4700, then you encounter, you start to get into negative gamma territory."
"7061210","7062530"," You start to get actually bearish."
"7063230","7066010"," And then you get full bear if you break below 465. "
"7067210","7069390"," 465 is when you put the bear suit on."
"7075050","7077530"," That's what took us down to 448."
"7078530","7080490"," A little while ago, a month ago or so. "
"7082940","7097670"," That's where you start putting price targets of 425, 400, 473"
"7097670","7099390"," peas are up to 28 cents."
"7100310","7102610"," So those are double in value, almost double."
"7103170","7104510"," I think they were at 15 cents earlier. "
"7127340","7128240"," Give me that dip."
"7128840","7130100"," Give me that dip to 130."
"7146240","7147340"," Keep on dipping. "
"7162120","7167260"," So we're tagging right now the buy that we took into close yesterday."
"7213880","7215860"," Starting to load up on some calls."
"7225060","7229840"," Got puts printing, 473s are at 28 cents. "
"7230560","7232220"," They started at 15 cents."
"7234280","7236600"," They're now at 29 cents."
"7237840","7246460"," Let me see if I can check. "
"7248300","7256930"," You see that news this morning that they're talking about giving businesses more money?"
"7257430","7261430"," RK is down below $89, outstanding."
"7262350","7265890"," I think my price target was 65 or 75 on RK."
"7268490","7270930"," I want to buy that RK down there. "
"7275170","7276170"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7276970","7279230"," Give me that RK, sweet love down there."
"7283760","7285020"," Let's bring up RK. "
"7287680","7291940"," I want to see RK at, I think it's like 65 or 70 bucks."
"7298730","7305410"," So we'll let RK roll, or we'll check if we see if this is bottom or not."
"7305790","7308350"," I think it's 65 bucks is where bottom is on RK. "
"7310650","7311710"," It could be wrong."
"7317860","7319400"," Okay, let's check RK."
"7320920","7322780"," Ooh, RK is getting wrecked. "
"7328310","7331230"," It's got minor buyers stepping in at 88, 33."
"7332010","7335130"," I think my price target in RK is like, yeah, there's 85 right there."
"7336370","7340410"," You can see support stepping in on RK 85 bucks. "
"7341330","7342250"," It's not a $3 down."
"7343010","7345710"," I think real support's even lower."
"7347610","7352950"," Real support is, yeah, this might be a buy in RK. "
"7356140","7358660"," Looks like everybody wants to buy it at 85 bucks."
"7359300","7360740"," Maybe it'll capitulate into clothes."
"7361660","7362620"," Get a nice run though. "
"7362920","7364260"," You get a nice run up to $97."
"7366100","7367660"," Get a nice run for RK."
"7371560","7374460"," 85.09 is what you're looking for on RK. "
"7378770","7380410"," If you're a bear, that's what you're looking for."
"7384890","7385750"," Oh, wait a minute."
"7385850","7386750"," Am I making money right now?"
"7392220","7393060"," Ooh, yeah, baby. "
"7393320","7393840"," Make me some money."
"7401280","7401800"," Sweet."
"7402980","7403760"," All right. "
"7411220","7413780"," Having some puts come in on the queues."
"7416040","7419180"," NVIDIA puts, Apple puts, not a lot."
"7420100","7421360"," Lots of spy calls coming in. "
"7422060","7425080"," Got spy January 5th, 476."
"7426980","7431340"," I've got some puts coming in on Wells Fargo, WFC on X."
"7433560","7436180"," Puts coming in 121, 26Ps."
"7437980","7439700"," AMC calls coming in again. "
"7441300","7442660"," Let's put the AMC calls."
"7445860","7447700"," I'm starting to print right now a little bit."
"7450720","7452100"," Let's look at AMC real quick. "
"7452240","7453900"," I'm going to look at AMC in the candlesticks."
"7453900","7455540"," Did AMC actually catch that bounce?"
"7456160","7457260"," Hell yeah, they did."
"7457700","7459180"," Did you guys watch that AMC bounce?"
"7459880","7460700"," F, yeah. "
"7462560","7464100"," Hey, Joey, take it easy, my brother."
"7465180","7466320"," Do you guys see AMC?"
"7467520","7468320"," AMC dipped."
"7469620","7471100"," Someone bought the dip on AMC. "
"7472120","7473000"," Fuck yeah."
"7474020","7478880"," If you guys want me to talk about SC sometime, SC was the trade in 2020."
"7479760","7481120"," I don't know that it's the trade anymore. "
"7481120","7484600"," Dude, before everybody knew it, dude, AMC is cranking."
"7485620","7486260"," Cranking."
"7487580","7524040"," A Ripper bounce off $22.94. Did"
"7524040","7525780"," AMC with a bounce?"
"7526720","7527180"," Heavy bounce. "
"7527900","7528360"," I never trade."
"7528680","7529600"," I never trade AMC."
"7532320","7533640"," But you know, three months pass. "
"7534960","7535280"," Big bounce."
"7538750","7539890"," Call premium."
"7540740","7541130"," Mm. "
"7542230","7544310"," Safe travels there, Joey."
"7554200","7562800"," You've got people loading up now on 478 calls on January 5th."
"7562880","7564560"," It was at like 100,000. "
"7564920","7567040"," Now it's at 128,000."
"7577730","7582780"," Yeah, now 128,000 calls at 478C."
"7583580","7584700"," There was some light. "
"7585260","7591800"," There was some call flow coming in on 477s as well."
"7592260","7593580"," Those are 34 cents."
"7596620","7601240"," And it looks like they might, when you've got a lot of put coverage on 476, 477. "
"7601980","7605380"," So it looks like they're going to, at some point, you got some spreads out there."
"7605480","7611620"," They're going to need to need to, at the end of the day, right?"
"7612460","7615480"," The Waps up here, 476, 36."
"7617160","7620280"," You've got more buyers than sellers on Spy right now. "
"7627440","7635280"," So usually it's a half an hour before FOMC meeting, half an hour before FOMC minutes, where you"
"7635280","7636920"," tend to see like a flat."
"7637460","7639280"," It'll be flat for like a half an hour."
"7639860","7644080"," And it'll like hit its target, its low target, then it rides flat for like a half an hour. "
"7644280","7644780"," Nothing happens."
"7644780","7648260"," And you might see the Agos step in on either side of the trade."
"7649060","7651680"," And if not, I usually take the opposite side. "
"7651840","7652500"," So we'll see what happens."
"7652960","7658620"," But the fact that we've sold off already, to this point, leads me to believe that we're going up."
"7662000","7664800"," I thought we were going to stay flat at like 477. "
"7667180","7670400"," If we could stay flat at 477, I would have taken the short side of that trade."
"7671000","7673500"," But I don't like that we traded down to 4531."
"7675620","7679520"," That's we got some real shitty news probably trading up. "
"7698490","7701170"," Some call premium kicking in on 478 as well."
"7701310","7702690"," It's not up to 17 cents."
"7702890","7705810"," It was down to 10 cents, I think, for a brief moment. "
"7710350","7713390"," You got a bounce going on right now on the Spy."
"7716790","7718490"," Cap is smart for not touching AMC."
"7724170","7729750"," If you guys need to be remembering how to roll, not roll, but add to your positions when a turn"
"7729750","7730270"," is happening. "
"7731050","7735150"," If you guys just, let's see if you buy FDs at 10 cents, let's see if I'm at 50 cents"
"7735150","7737910"," and it's going to trade down to 10 cents."
"7738170","7741930"," Let's see about 100 shares, or I'm at 100 contracts."
"7742970","7748010"," Let's see about 100 contracts of Spy FDs 478s for 50 cents. "
"7749370","7754370"," If you trade down to 10 cents, you buy another 400 at 10 cents."
"7754790","7757550"," That makes your position now 12 cents."
"7758950","7764450"," And if we go from, let's say we go from that 10 cents to 15 cents, you're now in the"
"7764450","7765150"," green making money. "
"7767960","7769060"," Yeah, AMC is ripping."
"7770580","7772580"," Is the mic volume getting lower?"
"7772800","7773760"," Let me say it turned up a little bit."
"7776900","7777460"," Thanks for saying something. "
"7777840","7781200"," This is a dynamic mic so it wants me to speak directly into it."
"7781200","7785520"," I have to reposition the mic and the side of my desk has a rolled edge on it."
"7786020","7790140"," So it doesn't want to check one two. "
"7790940","7791760"," That'll help."
"7792920","7795080"," Check one two, check one two three."
"7796540","7798460"," Got a nice little bounce on the Spy. "
"7800280","7801760"," Some money to be made there."
"7806600","7809040"," Those 478 calls are now heading up."
"7813440","7815560"," You've got a buyer's consuming sellers. "
"7815960","7818020"," You do have some more put buying up here."
"7818680","7821260"," It looks like more commitment from the bear side."
"7825520","7829220"," Those 473s are now, the 473Ps are now down to 18 cents. "
"7829660","7830720"," They were as high as 20."
"7830900","7831980"," So you're looking at that, right?"
"7832440","7835820"," You saw that we went to a high on the 478P or 473Ps."
"7836640","7838220"," Went up to 28 cents, right?"
"7838560","7842840"," You know that they were holding values somewhere down around 13 cents, 15 cents. "
"7843560","7845440"," Then they started holding value at 18 cents."
"7846040","7848120"," I expect them now to go down to like 10 cents."
"7848120","7854280"," It might be worth buying if there's volatility as we had closer to the bow or to FMC. "
"7858400","7862300"," See if you can get those 473Ps down to like 10 cents, 12 cents."
"7862900","7863560"," Grab a set of those."
"7866700","7869800"," Watch the swings in the charts or in the options chain. "
"7870500","7875100"," You'll see like a natural, you'll see the intrinsic value that's left over in these options."
"7876160","7880100"," Slowly deplete as the day wears on an option on OPEC stay."
"7880780","7883540"," But then you'll see them swing higher as they lose their base price. "
"7884250","7885460"," Throughout the course of the day."
"7887740","7893580"," Peton, Peton, January 21st, 36C."
"7894140","7895900"," Someone's got some balls on Peton. "
"7896800","7904080"," Amazon, call sweep, January 7th, 33, 30 calls, $27."
"7904880","7908220"," XLU, whoof, ready for this?"
"7908620","7916540"," XLU, January 20th, 65P puts, $3.1 million."
"7918360","7919560"," That's a good XLU. "
"7925860","7928680"," Someone's getting hella bearish on XLU right now."
"7930620","7935800"," Just heads up your bear out there, January 20th, 65P."
"7940640","7941940"," $3.1 million. "
"7946940","7951100"," And usually if you see a trade that big, you have to wait to take that trade."
"7951360","7954920"," It'll probably rip up into clothes and then you grab that put trade."
"7956120","7958800"," Not always, but that's for calls too. "
"7958900","7963180"," If you see a huge call trade come in, you'll usually see a dip, then it'll run."
"7964120","7968760"," If the same works for the put side, if you see like $3, $4, $5 million and puts come in,"
"7969300","7974340"," you want to wait usually, not always, but sometimes you just wait for like 15, 20 minutes, see if"
"7974340","7975200"," you get a quick rip higher."
"7975840","7980160"," And what that rip higher is, is it's the dealers hedging the trade that was taken. "
"7982620","7987860"," The dealers will hedge the other side of that trade to cover in case that put side prints."
"7989560","7994860"," You guys all understand how that works with options, that the dealers have to remain delta neutral,"
"7995380","7997680"," so they take the opposite side of your trade."
"8002340","8005000"," And you show us how the cues look, yeah, I'll show you guys where it looks. "
"8005420","8007520"," Just when you turn another screen, the volume becomes weaker."
"8007900","8009840"," Okay, so let me see if I can turn this around."
"8011910","8015750"," So I've got this dynamic mic and you have to speak into it. "
"8017210","8018910"," S.O.X.L. calls coming through."
"8019710","8020850"," I don't see them on my screener."
"8023030","8026950"," I.W.M. calls coming in, 222C January 5th. "
"8028630","8029990"," For only 66 grand."
"8031210","8037630"," Well, here's a good one for bears, S.N.A. Sierra November alpha."
"8039990","8042110"," February 18th, 230 P."
"8043270","8057000"," 230 puts, a million dollars, S.N.A. S "
"8057000","8061380",".Q. You guys ready for S.Q. We were just talking about S.Q. Someone was just telling me that"
"8061380","8062340"," S.Q is a bad trade. "
"8063220","8074100"," Well, here's S.Q. February 18th, 140 calls, a million dollars, S.Q. And"
"8074100","8076100"," S.L.U. is rolling over."
"8076800","8078660"," Just a ward of warning to all of you out there."
"8080380","8086680"," S.L.U. can roll over if we're bullish on the market, but I can also roll over if we're"
"8086680","8088000"," getting weakness in the market. "
"8088920","8091500"," I'm one of the market internals right underneath the hood of the engine."
"8097230","8099590"," Yep, so S.Q. just bounced off 148."
"8101430","8108190"," And you saw some calls coming in the front door for S.Q. Those are right in the money calls"
"8108190","8109930"," for February 18th, 140. "
"8110630","8111330"," It's not a bad trade."
"8112030","8114590"," I might wait for like the 10th to take the trade like that."
"8115230","8117070"," So maybe mark that on a piece of paper. "
"8117690","8119070"," February 18th, 140C."
"8119730","8121230"," And then it's a million dollar trade."
"8121570","8123830"," I might wait for like the 10th, 11th, 12th. "
"8124310","8125890"," We'll get this month's OPEC out of the way."
"8126450","8129630"," Hopefully we'll trade down right before that OPEC's."
"8129870","8139780"," The Thursday before OPEC's, which is the 20th, you could enter that trade"
"8139780","8140780"," to be a beautiful trade. "
"8141520","8142500"," Like 140C."
"8143140","8148340"," Not on the 20th, take it out like the 19th because we usually have a face ripper Thursday before"
"8148340","8149000"," OPEC's."
"8149760","8151600"," You grab that trade, we'll trade down. "
"8151800","8154940"," You grab that trade, you make the money on the Thursday before OPEC's."
"8155900","8158660"," And then you pick up all that premium heading into February."
"8159920","8166020"," You could take it right now, but in reality, the best part of that trade is probably down the road. "
"8170260","8172100"," I want to take a look at Amazon too."
"8176310","8177690"," And I'll bring up the queues right now."
"8179110","8181130"," Amazon looks like it's turning around as well. "
"8181490","8182150"," Keep your eyes on Amazon."
"8183030","8184290"," Keep your eyes on the queues."
"8184610","8187470"," Oh no, keep your eyes on the queues. "
"8187830","8190050"," You can see Amazon is curling up right now."
"8195629","8198410"," This feed is much better than the pet previous feeds, right?"
"8198850","8199510"," It's a little bit smoother."
"8200910","8201770"," Not so much. "
"8203629","8205670"," No, I don't have any screen problems today."
"8207740","8210219"," I've been reconfiguring the setup here."
"8211360","8214820"," Yeah, so the dip-eye and queue still looks like 390. "
"8216600","8217400"," Amazon's turning around."
"8217540","8218980"," I'm going to put an Amazon trade in right now."
"8219100","8228160"," Hold on, I think I am. "
"8243950","8262490"," Time to get my Amazon on January 21st."
"8273910","8276590"," I didn't get any fills yesterday on any of my spreads."
"8284440","8285400"," 220 for 280. "
"8308280","8309379"," Spy calls are printing."
"8312959","8314820"," Do you guys get into those spy calls or no?"
"8325260","8330280"," Hey Ryan, if you guys are catching me on the PayPal side of things, I only check those once a"
"8330280","8330400"," week."
"8333410","8339250"," If you guys are donating on the Captain's Alpha, because you don't want to donate through the"
"8339250","8346950"," PayPal link on YouTube, if you're donating on the Twitter posts that have posted to the top, I"
"8346950","8347770"," check those once a week. "
"8347770","8350950"," I announce those people on the weekends usually on Sundays."
"8351610","8352549"," We could drink a bear together."
"8354070","8355490"," And I appreciate the support. "
"8355650","8356430"," I really need that support."
"8356670","8360190"," It keeps me motivated to keep making these live streams, trading with you guys live."
"8361070","8365950"," I'm able to upgrade the equipment, the services, the displays that I post for you guys, show you"
"8365950","8366770"," guys different displays. "
"8372639","8373340"," I'll take a look at them."
"8373459","8374980"," I'll bring the MU chart up for you."
"8376660","8379520"," Yeah, so XLU, thanks Ryan. "
"8379700","8380299"," I appreciate it brother."
"8380299","8383440"," I really, you don't know how much I appreciate it."
"8385360","8387840"," For RAS XLU is a hiding place. "
"8388120","8388140"," No?"
"8388420","8388460"," Yeah."
"8389060","8390160"," So XLU is two things."
"8390660","8392580"," It's used as a hiding place, right?"
"8393120","8401060"," So if we're going to get some downward movement, you'll see XLU climb in fear of a downturn. "
"8401840","8406800"," The crazy thing is though XLU never stays up when we make the move down, XLU goes down."
"8407320","8408200"," It's like an old school habit."
"8408920","8410300"," Y'all do a Tesla as well. "
"8411460","8412480"," Down a little on Amazon."
"8412860","8413800"," Yeah, I wouldn't be too concerned."
"8414320","8420220"," Whenever I'm in spreads, I don't, whenever I do spreads, I don't care about time as much. "
"8421060","8422960"," I'm looking at a much longer time frame."
"8424920","8426080"," Y'all do Tesla too."
"8429820","8436170"," So the dip on the cues is 390. "
"8436630","8437110"," We know that, right?"
"8437290","8438630"," We saw the rejection down here."
"8439510","8440850"," We talked about that earlier, right?"
"8440850","8460950"," You had some rejection down here at 390.41. There's"
"8460950","8464370"," some sellers above at 390.304. Looks like it's range bound."
"8468040","8470200"," I have a Tesla video that I did for..."
"8473890","8475590"," I'm going to have to sell out of my calls here. "
"8476230","8492390"," So I did"
"8492390","8492990"," a Tesla video."
"8493310","8494530"," I just have to post it for you guys."
"8495130","8496790"," I'll put the Tesla heat map up though. "
"8497990","8503090"," And we'll talk in the video I talked to you about when to buy, when to expect the next Ripper"
"8503090","8503650"," on Tesla."
"8503650","8527870"," Ah, it"
"8527870","8528190"," goes on."
"8528290","8530390"," It's pendant 476 until FMC. "
"8531210","8533190"," Yeah, and I'll put UPST up right now."
"8534290","8538910"," UPST. Didn't we already do a UPST this morning?"
"8538910","8539670"," I swore we did. "
"8546090","8551540"," Make sure you guys, you know, if you guys go in my regular handle, Oracle is dumping."
"8552780","8554340"," Do I accept Bitcoin tips?"
"8554640","8555240"," No, I do not."
"8555860","8557040"," Should I accept Bitcoin?"
"8560220","8560880"," I haven't. "
"8561220","8562400"," Should I accept Bitcoin?"
"8562600","8563080"," Because I don't win."
"8563540","8563920"," Should I?"
"8568500","8569500"," Yeah, yeah."
"8570080","8571660"," Can you take a look at GM?"
"8571940","8572960"," Yeah, I look at GM right now. "
"8573860","8574520"," Yeah, I do."
"8575260","8579680"," I do zero-date spreads, if I can get them at the opening closes."
"8583180","8584680"," Yeah, I used to trade commodities. "
"8585580","8587920"," So I traded commodities for a few years."
"8588540","8591440"," One of the things about PayPal lately is tipping the captain right on Chas."
"8591820","8593220"," Apple's showing strength in all this chop. "
"8593860","8594920"," I'll look at Apple as well."
"8596460","8597540"," I used to trade commodities."
"8598680","8602060"," Matter of fact, I had a tanker full of oil delivered. "
"8602200","8603960"," I took delivery on oil once in my backyard."
"8603960","8609120"," I had to bury a tanker's worth of oil and hold on to it until coronavirus COVID started."
"8612120","8614100"," Or COVID led up a little bit, right?"
"8615800","8617940"," Yeah, so Spy's got a beautiful bounce on you guys. "
"8621140","8623420"," The bots of mine out of you on Friday calls."
"8626890","8628690"," You guys want me to do some Tesla?"
"8629350","8630730"," Okay, so let's look at Tesla real quick."
"8631250","8635170"," You had a nice bounce off support at 11.30. We know that the real support's down here at 1100,"
"8635230","8635610"," right?"
"8635950","8636770"," We've talked about that. "
"8637090","8639590"," We want to see that test on Tesla at 1100."
"8640330","8641330"," That's what you want to see."
"8641690","8648670"," You've got some light resistance above at 11.70. But the price target is above at 1200. "
"8648990","8654170"," It's not showing right now, but that's where the next price target is at 1100."
"8655390","8657690"," We're going to talk about why you want to see that 1100 bounce."
"8658790","8660430"," You want to see the banks buying it. "
"8661590","8662870"," You don't want to see this kind of..."
"8662870","8663670"," This is intraday bullshit."
"8664970","8667790"," You want to see that bounce down below because you want to see..."
"8667790","8670090"," You want to be riding on the coattails of banks, right?"
"8670530","8676330"," So on an intraday level, sure, you can ride up Tesla from 11.30 to 11.70. Hopefully it gets"
"8676330","8677730"," up there and you can take a small profit."
"8678310","8683910"," But when Tesla moves, right, if you guys are following me, we're waiting sometimes three, four,"
"8684030","8686170"," five days for that big giant bounce on Tesla. "
"8686670","8691070"," And we ride it for a couple of days, two, three days or whatever."
"8693610","8694670"," Let's see, do I accept Bitcoin?"
"8696010","8697230"," Yeah, no, I don't accept Bitcoin."
"8697530","8697630"," Maybe. "
"8697970","8698470"," I guess I could."
"8698570","8700250"," Do you guys prefer if I accept..."
"8700250","8701830"," Do you guys prefer that I accept Bitcoin?"
"8704790","8706290"," Do you want me to look at Apple too, right?"
"8706810","8708630"," UPST. I know Hocha's asked a few times. "
"8709710","8712870"," Hocha's might be a nice buy zone for UPST. Let's take a look."
"8718300","8727380"," Your buy the dip on UPST is 125, 16, and 125, 35. "
"8728240","8729800"," You've got clear skies above."
"8730560","8732660"," You've got about equal buyers and sellers."
"8733100","8734340"," There's no hero indicator. "
"8735160","8736600"," Looks like you got major support down there."
"8737140","8740160"," If I was day trading this, I would be looking to buy at 125."
"8741240","8743400"," And in reality, you could put an order in at 120. "
"8744900","8746060"," You get clear skies above though."
"8747700","8748340"," It's got nice support."
"8750860","8759650"," You do have some resistance right now currently at 129.95. Hopefully you can catch all that. "
"8760830","8765930"," And you've got some minor support above at 127.50. You've got slightly more sellers than buyers."
"8846060","8848740"," Yeah, so putting the oil back."
"8849540","8850940"," We were, I was part of Tanker Gang. "
"8852060","8857900"," If anybody remembers who Tanker Gang was, there were tankers that were parked off the coast of the"
"8857900","8858420"," United States."
"8859900","8864040"," And they had this guy that was like this guy from Greece."
"8864540","8866380"," Could barely speak a lick of English. "
"8866960","8871680"," They had him on CNBC as stock went from $1 to $60 or something."
"8871900","8874160"," He was talking about how tankers were the future."
"8874900","8878040"," And he was getting pumped up on CNBC. "
"8878960","8879960"," Any guys remember that stuff?"
"8882890","8885350"," Take Bitcoin as Captain of Houston Adult Dancer."
"8885830","8888430"," I don't know what's up with Bitcoin."
"8888970","8889990"," Sound like an airline pod. "
"8891070","8892250"," Sound like an airline pod."
"8892470","8892590"," LOL."
"8892950","8893870"," And you have clear skies above. "
"8894010","8895170"," We'll be cruising at 50,000 feet."
"8897860","8899300"," To be short, this bounced on Beyond."
"8900000","8902220"," All right, I'll check right now beyond for you. "
"8902640","8903980"," I'll look at Shop after that and then SQ."
"8906620","8909220"," So you found, so there's buyers on SQ right now."
"8909360","8910080"," Just as a heads up. "
"8911180","8912700"," You've got some more."
"8912820","8918740"," You got $129,000 came in on XLF January 21st."
"8919280","8921420"," There's still some hardcore belief in XLF. "
"8921420","8923040"," So you're looking for a bounce there."
"8924200","8929040"," Some light spy call putts coming in four 76P traded for today."
"8929720","8931520"," QQQQQQQUS 390Ps. "
"8932280","8937640"," They might break through—there's no real ceiling above QQQQ's That's an interesting trade."
"8938180","8941320"," More XLF calls, January 21st, 41C."
"8942560","8944020"," That's for 88,000 bucks. "
"8944920","8950160"," ArcG puts January 7th, 58.22. do."
"8950880","8954240"," Some apple calls coming in right now, Baba calls coming in right now."
"8955640","8957140"," IWM calls coming in right now. "
"8959880","8960520"," That was me."
"8961100","8964920"," That was me like, Hey, you're wife's boyfriend, how you doing?"
"8967320","8970920"," Yeah, that company only had one employee was like one old, a lot like one old, trusty guy."
"8971700","8973280"," Taker gang was a total disaster. "
"8974640","8976340"," Ryan knows all about Taker gang."
"8976900","8980420"," Like there are guys saying that they were going to take delivery in their backyards."
"8980780","8985080"," They were like, they're, they're guys trading, trading Taker gang and take tankers of oil. "
"8985640","8988420"," And you of course have to pay the money or take delivery."
"8989100","8989820"," And it was wild."
"8990360","8996820"," It was like, you know, like millions of dollars in oil for our chart on spy not looking good. "
"8997620","8999120"," Yeah, I don't trade charts normally."
"8999880","9002020"," I use them for some confirmation, but I don't trade them."
"9003300","9004520"," Some, I mean, I trade them somewhat. "
"9004940","9008600"," I trade them with gamma, negative and positive gamma."
"9011410","9013150"," Like I'll try to find out what the gamma is."
"9014730","9015950"," I'll trade charts like that. "
"9016670","9020430"," I use them to my confirmation bias after I use that stuff."
"9021010","9022770"," We have price targets for 80 on the spy."
"9024870","9026150"," That's what your price target is. "
"9028850","9034610"," If you don't get enough runway to get there, let's say we traded, I think by the 10th or 11th"
"9034610","9035150"," will be down at 465."
"9036190","9036510"," Yeah, 465."
"9037610","9039950"," But it might take like the eighth, ninth, 10th. "
"9040270","9041410"," And it's only the fifth right now."
"9042670","9045190"," So I'm looking to buy any dip right now until we get up to 480."
"9045650","9047530"," Who doesn't want to ride 480 down to 465?"
"9048490","9050110"," It's like 150 points down. "
"9050650","9051670"," That'd be a kick-ass trade."
"9052450","9053250"," Kick-ass trade."
"9053430","9056970"," If you're a bear, you want to buy puts at 480 and let us ride to hell. "
"9059750","9068980"," Alright, so sideways for three days"
"9068980","9071060"," down 130 points to you."
"9071620","9072460"," We'd make a dollar."
"9073160","9075260"," I guess, I guess you would if you're trading futures. "
"9077220","9084160"," But if you're trading options, you want a straight line to hell."
"9085080","9086840"," So you can make all that sweet tendies."
"9086960","9088140"," You got more buyers than sellers. "
"9090460","9096040"," You do have a pretty high negative put buying on the spy right now."
"9096800","9106790"," As we head into FOMC, we have 15 more minutes"
"9106790","9107050"," left."
"9107270","9114970"," I do want you to be aware that there is some heavy, heavy put buying on the spy right now. "
"9115430","9117290"," Bears are getting hungry."
"9122670","9127710"," So on beyond, is it time to short beyond?"
"9129070","9130950"," You guys want to know when to take a short on beyond?"
"9132150","9141450"," Take the short if you break through 59.79. You have light support at $59 on beyond"
"9141450","9144610"," but it's clear skies below if you're a bear on beyond."
"9145610","9146390"," See this right here?"
"9147670","9149830"," You do have more sellers than buyers. "
"9151350","9158650"," Your price target above is 67.63. What I would say to you if you're a beyond bear is just"
"9158650","9165710"," wait for a break below 59.74 and you're going to ride that down to 50 bucks."
"9166150","9169880"," You're going to ride that straight down to 50 bucks."
"9171700","9176220"," Now but be careful out there because there even though you have more sellers at this exact moment,"
"9176580","9185120"," their price target is 67.79. You're on a layer of weak support but pick it up after. "
"9186860","9192840"," If you want a short beyond, pick it up if it breaks through 59.79. Good question."
"9193320","9193920"," That was a nice one."
"9194080","9194420"," Thanks for that. "
"9194560","9195400"," Thanks for that shout out."
"9199720","9203580"," Can you look at shop and then I'll look at SQ."
"9206260","9211840"," So I want you guys to understand I was telling you guys earlier, when you see a heavy call side,"
"9211840","9213620"," you'll see a dip. "
"9214460","9220480"," If you see a heavy put side, you'll see a rip because the dealer heads those bets."
"9220980","9222460"," Does that make sense to all you guys out there?"
"9225210","9231630"," You got to see the opposite trade take place to hedge that trade."
"9242180","9246380"," So there was a giant there was a giant call taken out on SQ, right?"
"9246840","9248980"," You're going to see SQ dip and then rip. "
"9249560","9254460"," If you see a put, a large put coming like that, we saw XLU puts come in for like three"
"9254460","9255860"," million dollars for January."
"9256600","9260380"," You should see a rip first on XLU and then you'll see the dip."
"9260560","9264020"," So if you see a golden ticket come in, you want to wait a little bit before you enter that"
"9264020","9264280"," trade. "
"9264820","9269540"," And I normally enter those trades with like an extra two weeks on them and slightly more in money"
"9269540","9270680"," of wherever that trade is."
"9270980","9272020"," So here's an example."
"9272180","9276040"," So you had, what are these XLU puts?"
"9276620","9285520"," You had January 20th, 65P, 10,000 of them come in at $3.10 for $3.1 million, right?"
"9287340","9290340"," So we're at, I think we're at 70 bucks on XLU right now. "
"9294720","9295880"," So we're at an XLU."
"9298350","9299470"," We're at $71."
"9300070","9305090"," You can look at XLU and compare XLU and S to Q right now because XLU did just rip. "
"9305550","9308710"," So you'll see XLU rip and then it'll start to dip."
"9309290","9317230"," You want to then take that and if they're picking 65s for, they're picking 65s at an XLU for the"
"9317230","9323350"," 20th, I'd take it like a one more expiration later and I take slightly more in the money and"
"9323350","9325710"," usually on a spread too I'll do it on a spread."
"9326710","9331350"," So in case their trade doesn't work and they have to roll it into a big trade. "
"9331910","9335970"," Let's say they put on like 3 million and they have to add another 3 million dollars and put more"
"9335970","9336570"," time on it."
"9336690","9341230"," You're already sitting there pretty farther down the road and at a slightly more in the money"
"9341230","9342110"," price."
"9342670","9347310"," It just lends to the, to the, to the chances of that trade, that golden ticket printing. "
"9349650","9351330"," Same thing would go for that square trade."
"9352510","9362370"," You've got support, major support on square, alright, on shop at 1180, also down here at 1175 and"
"9364770","9366910"," shop's not really doing too much today."
"9367570","9369970"," Looks like, you know, we all know that the banks have taken over shop. "
"9385080","9387280"," Oh, those 2023, they get the dates wrong on that."
"9388880","9391980"," Oh, that was, you know what, scratch all that I said on XLU."
"9392360","9394440"," Thanks Justin for correcting me. "
"9395960","9396900"," I appreciate that."
"9399060","9401860"," Yeah, 2023, fuck those I'm sorry for swearing."
"9402160","9403560"," Screw those, screw those puts. "
"9406130","9406710"," That's a hedge."
"9413400","9414760"," Where is the dip on Twitter?"
"9417140","9422400"," But that still applies to any trades that are like a month out three months beyond an MA target."
"9425520","9427240"," Yeah, I get the wrong date on that one. "
"9427900","9428740"," But it doesn't matter."
"9429200","9433440"," If those, if those puts were like a month out three months out, if those were for like three weeks"
"9433440","9435460"," out, you'd still trade it that same way."
"9436720","9437760"," I have a piece of shit. "
"9439100","9442180"," That's why I'll be a buyer of NQ at 1590."
"9442860","9444200"," 980 with tight stop."
"9444680","9445280"," Time left. "
"9445440","9445980"," Yeah, I'll do I'm used."
"9446220","9446820"," Sorry about that desperate."
"9447000","9447400"," I apologize. "
"9451870","9452370"," What's up?"
"9455650","9457190"," No, you're in the front of the camera."
"9457330","9458730"," You don't have to stand back there."
"9459570","9460590"," Yes, just ask. "
"9460870","9461830"," Yes, I would love some coffee."
"9462110","9462590"," Do you want to take my coffee?"
"9467750","9468410"," Thank you, Lovey."
"9469170","9470290"," I appreciate the coffee. "
"9471070","9471570"," I love you."
"9476040","9476540"," My babies."
"9479120","9481260"," People are talking about having a coming squeeze on silver. "
"9481940","9483740"," Isn't there always an upcoming squeeze on silver?"
"9486870","9488210"," Did the squeeze already happen?"
"9488330","9489110"," I'm gold, right?"
"9489370","9493290"," Doesn't doesn't silver lag gold by a few weeks?"
"9493470","9493910"," Two, three weeks?"
"9496490","9497390"," Okay, MU."
"9499450","9503290"," That's well, I still like that MU trade."
"9504310","9511790"," Price targets still 100, resistance at 98 at 98, 98, 98, 87. "
"9512570","9514870"," Then sell it is at 99, 68."
"9515270","9516450"," Nothing's really changed here, right?"
"9518190","9520670"," Get the dip buy down below here at 95 bucks."
"9521190","9522470"," Trade's still up to 100 bucks. "
"9523090","9529770"," You are encountering some troubled waters above at $97, but we get more sellers than buyers on MU"
"9529770","9530230"," right now."
"9530750","9532370"," It's that trade that you just leave alone."
"9536200","9542220"," The only real concern on it would be weakness into OPEC's for this month. "
"9543580","9547060"," That weakness would come around the 10th or maybe before like the 8th or 9th."
"9547120","9551120"," You still have till Friday, right?"
"9551880","9556760"," Still have until the 7th, maybe another day or two."
"9557540","9558880"," I don't know how far out your calls are. "
"9570470","9571470"," I can explain that."
"9574340","9577460"," I just did MU levels below 15, 90, 15, 91."
"9578080","9579820"," People are talking about income squeeze in silver. "
"9580120","9583320"," Hey cap, what is the difference between the DX feed and the feeds on book map?"
"9584740","9587880"," Yes, so the DX feed is specific to the cash market."
"9588380","9596360"," There is a basket of other feeds for Globex, which is futures, Futes, and you can follow just a"
"9596360","9598160"," couple of them, one of them or all three of them."
"9599420","9601280"," You can buy all three, I think. "
"9602020","9604900"," That's what I have is all three and then you buy DX feeds separate."
"9605180","9606780"," You buy a separate feed for Bitcoin."
"9607520","9608420"," There's a bunch of other feeds. "
"9608700","9612080"," There's like, I think there's right now like 20 or 30 different feeds depending on what you're"
"9612080","9614400"," trading out there."
"9614660","9616340"," For cash market, DX feed is plenty."
"9619390","9622450"," Can you explain why you're targeting a 10 to 11 for a drop to 4, 7, 8, 4, 6, 5,"
"9622550","9622610"," 5, 5."
"9622970","9623170"," Sure. "
"9624390","9625630"," 10 minutes until FOMC."
"9626750","9628610"," Okay, so we got seven minutes left to FOMC minutes."
"9629670","9631870"," I'm gonna bring up spy real quick. "
"9636930","9638670"," Get in a second tap on the spy."
"9638930","9639390"," This is bullish."
"9640210","9644570"," Even if we turn lower, you're seeing that second bounce on spices. "
"9644970","9646910"," Spices trading very slow right now."
"9647410","9650250"," You are looking for this movement if you're bullish on the spy."
"9651610","9653150"," That doesn't mean won't trade lower. "
"9653530","9655650"," You would look for that third bounce or a failure."
"9656530","9659590"," Usually it's one, like you'll tap low, right?"
"9660130","9665590"," You'll make a higher low and your second tap and then your third one will tell you if we're going"
"9665590","9667410"," higher or lower, those out."
"9667610","9672490"," If you fail, if we fail on the third tap on spy right here, right, you'll know it. "
"9672850","9674970"," You take a bearish position if we fail there."
"9675370","9680290"," But on our third tap, you would look for a rip slightly higher, a small pullback."
"9680570","9684850"," You enter that fourth tap, that minor fourth tap, and you take that north. "
"9685310","9689330"," So we'll look for it as it comes up here as we trade forward."
"9691370","9693470"," Can you explain targeting the 10th or 11th?"
"9693530","9696530"," Okay, so you looking at runway, right?"
"9697010","9702550"," You're looking at when the calls and puts are bought, when the banks are buying and selling, when"
"9702550","9704630"," they're putting their spreads on for printing."
"9705730","9710570"," We have a quarterly OPEX and we have and we have a certain trades that are on for that. "
"9710570","9711790"," Then we have a monthly OPEX."
"9712310","9715230"," So we have a monthly OPEX this month on the 21st, right?"
"9715790","9718730"," So I'll bring this up for you here on this live stream so you can see it."
"9719450","9722170"," We have monthly OPEX on the 21st, right?"
"9722590","9727370"," I typically wanting these trades to print somewhere by this Friday, right?"
"9727750","9733150"," You'll end up seeing some weakness into this week right here, or it starts into around the 10th,"
"9733270","9733710"," right?"
"9733770","9740470"," And it gets really weak into like the 19th, usually, at the latest the 19th. "
"9741470","9744870"," But some, and then sometimes you'll see a rip on that Thursday, right?"
"9745390","9748910"," And we trade down into where the spreads are on the 21st."
"9749250","9752590"," It doesn't happen every month, but it does happen often, okay?"
"9753090","9756670"," And you want to look at the previous month where we traded, you want to be looking back on"
"9756670","9760850"," December, see where we were, see what the trade would be like for the month of January."
"9761670","9765990"," And what you're really looking for is the top end and the bottom end of that trade. "
"9766430","9772210"," They're probably either selling calls above and they're buying puts below or they're selling puts"
"9772210","9773870"," below buying calls above."
"9774910","9778770"," And that'll establish a trading range for the market."
"9779050","9782790"," Now, it doesn't always hold if unknown news comes out and unknown event comes out. "
"9783250","9786710"," But let's say that they printed their put side, then they want to print the call side."
"9786850","9787370"," Does that make sense?"
"9788230","9791890"," So what they'll do is let's say they're selling calls, right?"
"9792390","9792810"," High up."
"9792930","9795930"," Let's say this one's selling 500 calls or 480c. "
"9796070","9797150"," Let's say they sold 480c."
"9797710","9800130"," Let's say they bought 465ps."
"9800690","9805150"," They want the market to go down to print the 465ps. "
"9805450","9807890"," They collect that money, right?"
"9808270","9810730"," They've collected the money on the calls that they sold."
"9811310","9813030"," And then they go long the market at 465."
"9814050","9815650"," They buy the market at 465. "
"9816430","9821330"," We ride up on that Thursday, let's say, and they print again."
"9821570","9825990"," So they're printing both sides and they do they long the market again or they shorten the inverse"
"9825990","9826590"," as well."
"9827870","9829710"," I have to do a video on that stuff for you guys. "
"9829890","9834010"," So you can see how the banks win both sides of the trades and then they win a third time"
"9834010","9834550"," on their trades."
"9840220","9845300"," Yeah, so the coffee, yeah, my youngest daughter came to me and she wrote a piece of paper, she"
"9845300","9846840"," wrote, would you like some coffee?"
"9851650","9852010"," Pelosi."
"9858010","9858910"," What about gold?"
"9859490","9859810"," AMC. "
"9860630","9861810"," Talked about AMC already today."
"9862930","9864430"," I have a video for you guys."
"9864810","9866290"," I have some videos when I upload at the end of the day today. "
"9866530","9867870"," I didn't have time this morning to upload them."
"9867890","9868210"," I got Tesla."
"9868990","9869550"," What's my list?"
"9869810","9871650"," I got a whole list of videos that I made for you guys. "
"9872190","9873370"," I think I had to Tesla, AMC."
"9874090","9877030"," I did the market so you guys can see where support and resistances are."
"9878850","9880110"," At least you get some coffee. "
"9880670","9881750"," That wasn't my wife."
"9882350","9883330"," That was my daughter."
"9885470","9887430"," The Hans tried to squeeze silver and it didn't work. "
"9887590","9887810"," I agreed."
"9889490","9890210"," I already wrote."
"9890530","9893830"," Yeah, so I traded the spy on this rip down here. "
"9894050","9896890"," I bought at 17 cents, 15 cents and 10 cents."
"9897430","9901570"," I wrote it up back up to 18 cents and sold and I'm going to look for another."
"9902170","9904810"," There's another bounce just to place it at 149. "
"9905890","9911150"," I'm going to look for one more dip down here and if we rip slightly higher, I'll take one more"
"9911150","9912750"," trade higher in a minute."
"9913790","9914970"," So I've taken one trade already."
"9917600","9918340"," Your aim squeeze. "
"9918660","9919520"," Did you play already, Captain?"
"9919720","9919960"," Oh, yeah."
"9920560","9923920"," Could you please see what the fuck I am I was doing?"
"9924500","9924760"," Sure."
"9925160","9925860"," Let's do IWM. "
"9927100","9927900"," I got somebody."
"9928180","9931080"," Somebody's like, please IWM, don't die."
"9932260","9939780"," So there should be weakness in IWM if you got volatility from bears telling you that everything is"
"9940360","9941640"," everything's going to be bad, right?"
"9942320","9943660"," I'll trade IWM with you today. "
"9944480","9946220"," I'm totally down and trading out of you."
"9950730","9954350"," Alexa, the silver squeezer result and silver going to 40 when it happens."
"9955110","9957450"," The day rate, the day rate hike is announced. "
"9958390","9960270"," Put your money on silver calls for your."
"9960410","9961850"," So this is one problem too."
"9963910","9966570"," You guys shouldn't be following rate hikes. "
"9967630","9969090"," You guys shouldn't be following."
"9969330","9970850"," So you see your price target up here?"
"9971610","9972490"," Price targets 230."
"9973550","9975190"," You guys want to look up. "
"9975770","9981090"," I posted on my regular handle last night about dispersion trading."
"9981370","9983090"," That's taking place in the indexes right now."
"9983430","9985770"," You want to be targeting individual tickers if you can. "
"9986290","9987690"," Watch that video that I posted."
"9987910","9989190"," I think it was from tasty trade."
"9989790","9992750"," You guys want to be seeing what's going on with the indexes right now. "
"9993670","9995990"," Okay, there's no rotation right now."
"9996710","10002970"," There's a trade going on right now where the where the some parts of the biggest basket of tickers"
"10002970","10010210"," for the indexes are being traded while puts and calls are being sold above and below on the market."
"10013050","10014750"," Think of it like a car. "
"10015270","10018950"," They're making more money off the wheels, the windows and the doors than they are in the actual"
"10018950","10019350"," car."
"10020130","10021010"," So that's what the focus is."
"10022770","10028010"," You've got a bounce here at 222.48. Looks like some pretty good support. "
"10028350","10030650"," You've got some you've got some resistance right here."
"10030650","10037470"," This can create a squeeze situation above at 223.60. Do you think are you all doom and gloom on"
"10038190","10039150"," IWM right now?"
"10039890","10040530"," I'm not."
"10042130","10043030"," I'm not at all. "
"10043870","10045010"," You see this right here?"
"10046070","10054210"," You get all your buyers and sellers fighting each other right now in IWM."
"10055290","10057010"," I'm not bearish in IWM right now."
"10061300","10063160"," This happens every time we have news. "
"10064980","10066520"," You guys think it's going to crash right now?"
"10066520","10068200"," Probably who's afraid of IWM right now?"
"10068280","10068880"," Crashing everybody?"
"10069800","10071380"," You guys all doom and gloom out there?"
"10072820","10077260"," Let's say you think that IWM is going to crash right now."
"10080440","10081820"," Rip IWM, huh?"
"10082100","10084740"," You guys are the wrong side of the trade so often."
"10086880","10088120"," Follow inflows, moon us. "
"10088680","10089780"," You guys are always so negative."
"10090480","10092320"," How many of you guys are on the wrong side of trades?"
"10094680","10095160"," Seriously."
"10097960","10099040"," Rip IWM. "
"10100320","10102240"," Where does IWM go?"
"10103880","10107720"," Explain to me like looking at this buy side and sell side right now right?"
"10109800","10111300"," Where does IWM go at this point?"
"10112220","10113120"," Does it go down to 213?"
"10113460","10113980"," Is that what you're thinking?"
"10115640","10118020"," Oh wait a minute we got a little support down here."
"10118380","10118780"," 206."
"10120340","10126120"," So we think that we think that IWM is going to collapse to 206 right now?"
"10128120","10128600"," 207ish?"
"10129580","10130060"," Yeah. "
"10131020","10136140"," You know I take this trade right now over the so if we were up at 230 I would take"
"10136140","10140940"," the trade down to 222 or two you know like 222 for at 240."
"10141420","10147500"," I'd take the trade down at 230 or two even 223 but would I take the trade right now and"
"10147500","10148400"," IWM where it's at?"
"10149220","10149700"," No."
"10150840","10151660"," Not as a bear. "
"10153560","10155780"," I want to see us break through 224."
"10157240","10159800"," If we break through there I might pick up a bear trade."
"10165200","10167260"," So the bear trade today at IWM was at the bell right?"
"10169100","10172600"," And here we are squeezing on IWM right now. "
"10172600","10172900"," Shocker."
"10174580","10175020"," Shocker."
"10179420","10180840"," You guys kill me out there. "
"10181440","10187260"," You guys got to know like the bear trade was at IWM with the open."
"10187700","10188840"," Where's the bull trade at IWM?"
"10189980","10191300"," Right now where we are."
"10194290","10195430"," You guys are killing me. "
"10196010","10198330"," How many of you guys are taking the wrong side of trades out there?"
"10200960","10210950"," I can't you guys if you missed"
"10210950","10213470"," the move take the other side of the trade."
"10214990","10215510"," Jesus."
"10217880","10218300"," Flip. "
"10218700","10222800"," If you're a bear when you run trade."
"10223460","10229360"," If you're the bull take the bear trade right?"
"10230300","10231560"," So I got to the game down here."
"10236010","10236530"," Flip. "
"10236530","10238450"," You guys are killing me."
"10239310","10243850"," So you saw that you saw that so that was just a short that was just all that was was"
"10243850","10246230"," a short short covering right?"
"10247010","10248830"," You really have to see us go that."
"10249130","10252130"," You're not saying we're not going down to 215 or 205. "
"10252830","10259210"," What I'm saying to you is that this is FOMC meeting minutes like what what are you expecting right"
"10259210","10259510"," now?"
"10261290","10262570"," You guys are sickos."
"10262890","10263970"," You guys are killing me."
"10266370","10267710"," You guys are killing me. "
"10267770","10269130"," You missed the trade at the open."
"10269650","10270910"," That was the bear trade."
"10273040","10277480"," This is not the bear trade that this is if you want to make it the bear trade you have"
"10277480","10280840"," to wait until we break back break through to pick it up. "
"10283630","10283950"," All right."
"10284110","10285610"," So they may didn't be getting any news here."
"10286270","10289030"," Policymakers also discuss when they might reduce in the feds a trillion. "
"10289270","10290330"," Yeah, that's non news."
"10293590","10295710"," No timeline set to sell off."
"10296910","10297970"," Dead cat balance. "
"10297970","10299210"," It's over sell sell sell."
"10299570","10300110"," I love you."
"10300250","10300770"," You're a boomer. "
"10301170","10302750"," This volatility is insane."
"10302810","10303990"," That was a crazy candle."
"10308400","10310680"," So we've got the IWM on right now for the bears. "
"10311280","10312460"," See if they can break through."
"10312940","10315500"," We have more buyers than sellers right now on IWM."
"10317600","10318160"," All right. "
"10318300","10318660"," Now you know what?"
"10318700","10319380"," We're kind of in the middle."
"10319640","10321360"," I'm not going to call it for either side right now."
"10321800","10322540"," Call this what?"
"10323680","10324040"," Volatility. "
"10325220","10326940"," You switch back to the spy real quick."
"10327720","10328840"," So head back over here to spy."
"10329300","10331620"," You got more buyers than sellers currently on the spy. "
"10332640","10334080"," There is a battle going on."
"10334220","10336720"," You've got lots of bears stepping in on the option side of things."
"10337280","10345280"," But you do have more buyers right now currently on the spy than you do on on IWM. "
"10347820","10351800"," You do have a buy coming in an IWM January 10 to 25 C."
"10352240","10353600"," $45,000."
"10353940","10355880"," You got buys coming in on Apple QQQ."
"10356220","10358040"," You've got some puts coming in. "
"10358120","10359680"," You got Nvidia calls coming in."
"10359840","10361700"," You got puts coming in on you, you, you."
"10362300","10364680"," You've got what else you have. "
"10365380","10366100"," That's about it."
"10366160","10367060"," That's all I see so far."
"10367060","10369560"," You do have some sellers on spy right now. "
"10371180","10374340"," We're going to look at IWM and see if we break through and crash down at 205."
"10375660","10381420"," And you are looking for a break below 221.92 if you're going to pick up the short side."
"10382120","10383160"," I would be cautious here. "
"10383320","10384820"," Okay, you guys know I can flip back and forth."
"10385600","10387800"," I'm probably going to take a train on IWM myself right now."
"10388160","10389400"," Let me just a second. "
"10399540","10414740"," I'm going"
"10420150","10421370"," to take 225 C."
"10421790","10422250"," 50 cents."
"10433170","10437670"," Quinn is saying that may need to increase fed funds rate sooner or at faster pace than previously"
"10437670","10438570"," anticipated."
"10439190","10440530"," The FOMMC Minute Show. "
"10440930","10444870"," Yeah, you got to see we need we need we need news that wasn't included in the first one."
"10453380","10455160"," We got increased volume on IWM."
"10455880","10457140"," It's really flat right now. "
"10457240","10462300"," You've got slightly more puts than calls, but it's not enough to make a difference only minus nine"
"10462300","10462640"," thirteen."
"10463360","10467240"," You've got same buyers, same sellers, although the volume has increased in IWM."
"10468400","10470920"," Let's check out the spy real quick. "
"10475870","10481050"," You do have some major negative flow coming in on the spy."
"10481310","10487630"," You've got minus three fifty two three fifty six on options flow, but you do have buyers absorbing"
"10487630","10497430"," sellers right now in the spy and the price"
"10497430","10500450"," target for yesterday when I said I wanted to be a buyer of the spy."
"10501130","10504590"," We just tagged it at four seventy four fifty fifty six. "
"10514150","10515210"," I hope I can get my coffee."
"10545990","10549450"," Yeah, you do have buyers stepping in and force on spy right now."
"10549510","10550470"," Just be aware of that. "
"10550870","10553330"," You have buyers stepping in and force."
"10553390","10557770"," You've got a hundred thirty eight thousand one hundred thirty one thousand on the spy currently."
"10562600","10565280"," You have a similar situation taking place in IWM. "
"10565800","10568980"," You know, if nothing, let's see what you guys are typing here."
"10569380","10573760"," Members also agreed that with emergence of a mobile car environment, it was appropriate to note the"
"10573760","10578460"," risk of new variants of the virus and their assessment risk to the oh, that's positive."
"10580020","10581400"," Neil, thanks for all the updates. "
"10581420","10583420"," Members also noted the Fed's reserve Fed reserves."
"10584160","10587260"," Ongoing asset purchase holding scores would continue to foster smooth market functioning."
"10588000","10594600"," Uh oh, some felt reduction in balance sheet starting relatively soon after lift up may be"
"10594600","10597360"," appropriate relatively soon after lift up. "
"10597620","10601060"," Neil, you know, Neil's talking about uh, FMC volumes nuts."
"10601500","10602420"," We leaked this."
"10603820","10605340"," Yeah, they announced nothing today. "
"10605760","10611520"," If anything, the only real changes are what Neil Hayden is saying because we weren't talking about"
"10611520","10612980"," the Omicron virus in December."
"10613620","10617800"," So members also agreed that with the emergence of Omicron variant, it was appropriate to note the"
"10617800","10621360"," risk of new variants of the virus and their assessment of risks to the economic outlook."
"10621640","10622120"," That's not good. "
"10622380","10623120"," That relates back."
"10623280","10629320"," That's not that's actually negative because Omicron did shut down Europe and their stock market did"
"10629320","10630860"," suffer from that shutdown."
"10631280","10632600"," Members also noted the Fed reserves. "
"10633160","10637080"," Ongoing asset purchase and holding the security would continue to foster smooth market functioning."
"10637520","10638540"," Okay, so this is important."
"10639800","10644560"," Well, you guys to realize I was trying to talk about this earlier to you guys and this is very"
"10644560","10644980"," important. "
"10645180","10645360"," Okay."
"10646280","10654620"," And you know, I'm not really focused myself on the tapering or the rate increases the thing that"
"10654620","10656980"," you all really want to be paying attention to."
"10657320","10662160"," We do see some buyers stepping in on the spy at 469, 470. "
"10667410","10670070"," Looks like smart money is at 470 on the spy."
"10671390","10673790"," So we might be going down to 470 at this point."
"10676610","10678230"," Might see spy coming down to 470. "
"10679010","10682550"," Do you see this in this, this, this, these buyers that just stepped in down here?"
"10683290","10685490"," There are some buyers stepping in."
"10685910","10687610"," Now the what I get back to that conversation."
"10688890","10692210"," Don't focus so much on the rates in the in the tapering. "
"10692430","10695850"," You should, but don't be focusing as much on that."
"10696210","10699670"," The only thing that's critical that you should know about."
"10699870","10707170"," Well, I guess if they increase the number of the rating if the if the excuse me, if the rates"
"10709060","10712160"," let's say we have two to three planned if we went to four or five. "
"10712160","10713720"," Yeah, you have to be concerned about that."
"10714280","10718320"," The real concern is the money coming into the system."
"10719200","10720760"," You don't think about it like this. "
"10722000","10725240"," If they're still pouring money and it doesn't matter how they're doing it, right?"
"10725380","10730680"," If they make some bullshit up, if they say this morning, this morning, Walter Bloomberg posted an"
"10730680","10738980"," article that said that the Senate is entertaining funneling more more money into businesses and"
"10738980","10742540"," they're going to figure out how they're doing that more stimulus basically into businesses, right?"
"10744140","10749440"," If they're going to manipulate our economy and our stock market and everything else out there with"
"10749440","10753660"," money flow, it doesn't matter if they taper, raise rates."
"10754460","10757120"," Those things matter, but not as much as the money flow."
"10757440","10760640"," And let's say they let's say they stop buying bonds, right?"
"10761800","10764860"," But let's say they start to extend grants to businesses. "
"10765940","10768420"," That's still money flow coming into our system."
"10769040","10769820"," And that's the key."
"10770320","10774220"," If they turn that off, that's when we start to crash, right?"
"10774700","10778680"," So you want to see where they're put, if they're going to continue with the money flow, let's say"
"10778680","10782340"," you say out there, well, they can't continue with the money flow if they taper and they can't raise"
"10782340","10785380"," rates until they tape are done tapering yada yada yada, right?"
"10785800","10791600"," But if they find out some other way to pump money into the system, no matter how they do it,"
"10792040","10796960"," if they do, if they choose a different route to pump money into the system, if they keep that tap"
"10796960","10802120"," flowing, even if they even if they have the drain open, letting some of it drain off our economy,"
"10802580","10804320"," then that's good for the stock market. "
"10804560","10809280"," The only thing that's really bad for the stock market is if they stop the money flow into the"
"10809280","10814020"," system and start to taper and increase rates, okay?"
"10814360","10818720"," Because then you're removing money from the system that that's not being replaced, right?"
"10818720","10820200"," And no way is it being replaced."
"10820780","10824900"," When you start to see that talk about, hey, we're going to send some more money to visit to Main"
"10824900","10830640"," Street, USA or whatever, any of that kind of noise, that's the real, that'll prop our market up"
"10830640","10831620"," even if we trade lower."
"10832000","10838700"," If we trade lower, even on tapering fears or if we trade lower on rate fears, there still will be"
"10838700","10839080"," a bottom. "
"10839760","10843880"," When the bottom will be pulled, the rug gets pulled only when the money stops flowing."
"10857130","10863070"," So you guys, it's not just, it's not just the bond purchasing, it's not just the liquidity that"
"10863070","10865350"," they're adding, it's how they add it to the system."
"10867410","10869830"," Hey, markets, what do they say about QT, brother?"
"10874520","10876180"," Yeah, what do they talk about QT?"
"10876880","10883060"," Did you see that bullshit this morning markets for mayhem about the that Walter Bloomberg put out"
"10883060","10889880"," about the Senate's going to talk about putting more money into Main Street, USA or something, some"
"10889880","10890300"," kind of nonsense?"
"10893140","10893480"," Exactly. "
"10893660","10895920"," Markets for mayhem knows exactly what he's talking about."
"10896640","10898220"," And this is what will tank the markets."
"10899420","10901260"," The rates, right?"
"10901420","10904300"," So you have like a three-body problem, right?"
"10905680","10915540"," You've got, you've got, there'll be some kind of, there'll be some weakness for when the tapering"
"10915540","10917260"," accelerates. "
"10918080","10920960"," You'll have some weakness when rates start, right?"
"10921040","10923300"," Some fear, but there'll be a bottom from that."
"10924480","10928000"," The only time you get the market crash, though, is if they turn the money off."
"10928580","10932060"," It doesn't matter how they have to turn it off. "
"10932300","10936140"," And I'm not talking about just the bond purchases."
"10936460","10940540"," If they say, well, we're turning off bond purchases, but we're going to give grants to Main Street,"
"10940740","10942520"," USA, that's not turning the money supply off."
"10949090","10952860"," So maybe markets for mayhem can comment on that. "
"10984290","10993630"," So we've got some puts rolling and we've got spy January 10th, 470 P, you've got spy"
"10993630","11003310"," January 5th, 474 Tesla January 7th, 1080 puts, SQ January 21st, 145 puts,"

"11042780","11044400"," January 5th today."
"11044800","11051880"," So they're playing the bounce right now, you've got that for $600,000 split across four different,"
"11052040","11057020"," four different, what is this right there?"
"11057920","11060040"," Now it's a block and a split and a block and a sweep."
"11061080","11064660"," On QQ, no, a block, a sweep and a block and a split. "
"11065660","11072140"," So you got one, two, three, four, five, $600,000 on QQQQ 388 calls."
"11079550","11080370"," Let me go scroll back up."
"11084850","11085870"," Yeah, markets for mayhem. "

"11625940","11628660"," I will add that source for the future."
"11628740","11631080"," I wasn't anticipating every call, but I could put you on the speaker."
"11631240","11633080"," Do you want to talk to everybody out here?"
"11636980","11637500"," Right on. "
"11637640","11638140"," Hold on one second."
"11642010","11645970"," So you guys want to let me know out there in YouTube land if you can let me know if"
"11645970","11650050"," you can hear this conversation."

"11668460","11668980"," Hang tight."
"11669060","11669600"," It'll be just a moment."
"11675150","11676690"," So they did talk about QTO. "
"11677210","11684690"," That balance sheet reduction is the name of the game as well as accelerating their hike cycle"
"11684690","11685050"," apparently."
"11685990","11687770"," And the problem with this."
"11688150","11689130"," Hold on one second. "
"11689470","11689950"," Hold on one second."
"11691250","11693070"," We do hear flow algo sound."
"11694390","11699130"," Okay, so you should hear a plank. "
"11699370","11700290"," We're almost there, Alex."
"11701270","11710860"," Let me change the mic setup so that we can get you"
"11710860","11712500"," directly into the mic."
"11713800","11714720"," Good to hear, man. "

"11715680","11716180"," How you doing?"
"11718720","11719200"," Excellent."
"11720060","11722720"," I'm going to put the dynamic mic right on you. "
"11723720","11724200"," Okay."
"11724860","11726460"," Thanks for joining us today."
"11726700","11727860"," I appreciate you coming in. "
"11728580","11730540"," Next time I'll kind of get you on straight discord."
"11731320","11732780"," They hear markets for mayhem."
"11732840","11734280"," Everybody's pumped up right now. "
"11735920","11736640"," All right."
"11737440","11738540"," I appreciate it."
"11738640","11740840"," I'm both humbled and honored by the support of y'all. "
"11740840","11741560"," Y'all are amazing."
"11742240","11744880"," And you got you got a great captain of the ship here with Jim."
"11745200","11753080"," So look, we had if you listen to my podcast yesterday, we had the kind of nightmare scenario play"
"11753080","11756080"," out that I was concerned about, which was QT. "
"11756720","11757680"," We weren't."
"11757720","11763100"," We were really hoping that we would not see the Fed, broach this subject until later on in the"
"11763100","11766860"," year, and instead they actually talked about it in December."
"11768040","11770340"," And so, you know, Powell hinted at that a little bit. "
"11770540","11774700"," He kind of said that they mentioned it, but he wasn't very specific in his press conference."
"11774880","11780040"," In fact, he kind of tried to dissuade any questions about it saying it was kind of like a future"
"11780040","11780680"," discussion."
"11780680","11786040"," And indeed, there was actually a plan put forth that they want to do quantitative tightening pretty"
"11786040","11789620"," much as they as they're completing the rate hike cycle, if not earlier. "
"11790080","11796580"," And the problem with this, and if you recall, the late part of 2018 is that QT is literally"
"11796580","11799220"," draining liquidity out of the system."
"11799520","11803480"," That's the lifeblood of this entire bull market going back to 2009."
"11804300","11810460"," Okay, so when you have an abundance of liquidity, you have this sort of rising tide that lifts all"
"11810460","11810700"," boats. "
"11810940","11812540"," You get a bid on just about everything."
"11813080","11818420"," And if you want a good example of that, look back to April of 2020 when central banks around the"
"11818420","11823420"," world in concert added 12 to 14 trillion dollars of liquidity in a matter of weeks."
"11824040","11825900"," And so you had this velocity of liquidity. "
"11826100","11827500"," It was absolutely staggering."
"11828240","11829380"," Came into the market."
"11829680","11834080"," And of course, everyone, everything I should say had a bid. "
"11834520","11837820"," You know, there were people that were making four or five hundred percent returns in 2020 because"
"11837820","11843460"," the velocity of that liquidity sloshing through the system put just about every risk asset on a"
"11843460","11844060"," strong bid."
"11844560","11847500"," And so what happens when you invert that paradigm?"
"11847960","11849780"," Well, that's what we're looking at now."
"11849800","11856920"," And the only other example we have in US market history is the QT tantrum that we had in late"
"11856920","11859140"," 2018, right?"
"11859720","11860900"," So what happened then?"
"11861080","11863960"," We had this really profound drawdown. "
"11864760","11870160"," And we had a bid back after December, but we did not make a new all-time high in the"
"11870160","11875640"," S&P until the Fed said we're not going to do any more QT, right?"
"11875740","11880200"," They actually started the pivot more towards easing again to try to take some of the pain and the"
"11880200","11881080"," fear out of the market."
"11881500","11886200"," So that's one thing that I want to just mention is that, you know, QE was the liquidity factory."
"11886680","11889960"," This is not a market that operates on economic activity. "
"11890020","11893700"," In fact, when you have strong macro, you have the market sell off."
"11893780","11895140"," Yeah, that's strong jobs number today."
"11895460","11898860"," You know, that boosted rates and you had a lot of weakness in some parts of the market, especially"
"11898860","11900320"," a rate tentative component. "
"11900320","11903680"," So this is not a market that wants strong macro."
"11903800","11909340"," It wants a weak macro because that keeps the faucet of liquidity running, right?"
"11909880","11914380"," And so now they're saying, we're going to turn off that faucet."
"11914500","11917360"," And now we're going to drain the pool too, right?"
"11917500","11919420"," So they're not even just turning off the faucet. "
"11919480","11920160"," That's tapering."
"11920160","11922640"," They're saying we're going to drain the whole pool."
"11922860","11925700"," That whole tie that lifted all the boats, we're going to take that away. "
"11926760","11933060"," So the other thing that's really important to think about here is that this consternation by the"
"11933060","11941220"," Fed, this sort of politicized inflation concern, this comes from an inherent misunderstanding as to"
"11941220","11943040"," how the Fed operates, right?"
"11943300","11946340"," The Fed stimulates the economy from the top down."
"11946520","11947840"," It's very supply side driven."
"11948100","11952300"," The transmission mechanism of monetary policy is directly into financial markets. "
"11952500","11956100"," So it's not like when the Fed does QE, you get $100 in the mail."
"11956660","11957560"," You don't, right?"
"11957780","11961920"," If you trickle down and maybe you get a benefit if your own assets, right?"
"11962040","11965780"," Maybe you own a house, your house goes up in price, maybe you own some stocks or stocks or your"
"11965780","11971720"," bonds go up in price, but it doesn't actually really have a real world connection to driving"
"11971720","11974220"," tangible durable inflation."
"11975440","11980380"," And so the problem that happens here, in fact, this is going to get, we're going to get into the"
"11980380","11983200"," weeds a little bit here on this, and I'm going to talk about one of my theories as to how"
"11983200","11984340"," this can make inflation worse. "
"11984960","11990620"," But the problem here is that when you do QT, when you do tapering, when you do rate hikes and"
"11990620","11998600"," the inflation is driven more by supply chain issues than it is by demand and it's also driven by"
"11998600","11998800"," labor."
"11999120","12002720"," Well, what happens to all these components in the supply chain that are leveraged?"
"12002980","12005400"," These are all companies that are paying on their debt."
"12005820","12008380"," If their refinance cost goes up, what are they going to do?"
"12008680","12011060"," They're going to pass that cost increase down the supply chain. "
"12011180","12014340"," That's another form of inflation inflation from higher funding costs."
"12014800","12021720"," So the Fed has no levers it can pull that actually are going to reduce the velocity of inflation."
"12022180","12027020"," And in fact, and here's the ironic part, the Fed as it is perennially is linked to the party. "
"12027400","12029680"," The velocity of inflation is already probably peaked."
"12030740","12036020"," And so if we can't really acknowledge that, then it's going to seem like their policy is working at"
"12036020","12038660"," first, but the reality is natural forces are at work."
"12038940","12044540"," But clearly it's tightening globally, the global economy is swelling, and the velocity of inflation"
"12044540","12045940"," is beginning to show signs of opinion. "
"12046140","12046940"," Look at those ISM numbers."
"12047600","12048380"," They came out yesterday."
"12049040","12051000"," That was some of the lowest numbers we've had in 10 years. "
"12053360","12054880"," That's something to keep an eye on."
"12055020","12061780"," So what we have happening now is the Federal Reserve is essentially telling the market, we don't"
"12061780","12068200"," have the tools to fight this battle, but we're going to try with the tools that we do have."
"12068380","12074160"," And remember, Jay Powell has repeatedly said that his view is that if inflation gets beyond their"
"12074160","12077280"," comfort level, that they will act, and they will act rapidly. "
"12077600","12082200"," So this is the Fed doing that 180 pivot, and they're saying they're going to act rapidly."
"12082620","12086700"," But remember, they cannot actually do that much."
"12086780","12090800"," Now let's talk about the other elephant in the room for a second to counterbalance all of this. "
"12091380","12095620"," The United States government has 30 trillion dollars of debt, right?"
"12096080","12100680"," And so the debt that they have is typically paid on a normalized rate that matches the 10-year"
"12100680","12100880"," bond."
"12101500","12106840"," So the 10-year is at 1.5%, 30 trillion, 1.5%, that's a 450 billion deficit spent, right?"
"12107200","12108280"," That's kind of where we were."
"12108500","12109160"," Where are we headed?"
"12109640","12114700"," Well, if we have QT, a 3% to 4% 10-year yield is reasonable to expect. "
"12115260","12118840"," At 3%, 30 trillion of debt, the deficit spent becomes $900 billion."
"12119440","12121220"," That starts talking about porting austerity."
"12121780","12124880"," That's bigger than the DOD budget, which is $740 billion. "
"12125280","12128740"," The QT discussion is completely negative."
"12129700","12134700"," The tapering and the rates we can all live with, because the water is still flowing."
"12135120","12140000"," The moment that they said, which they did today, I don't know who pointed that out earlier, it was"
"12140000","12141480"," Ryan or somebody in here. "
"12141980","12147860"," And the moment that that discussion is starting, which you're making the point of, is now you have"
"12147860","12150720"," the drain and you have the water spigot being turned off."
"12151320","12152600"," Maybe it was Douglas or something."
"12153500","12159760"," And on the back end of that, I mean, hearing that, seeing that article come out this morning with"
"12159760","12166520"," the Senate offering the dovish bullshit saying, well, we're going to discuss it in the Senate. "
"12166640","12172060"," You know that that's not going to pass in the Senate to be sending more money to Main Street, USA,"
"12173020","12174080"," to keep the money flowing elsewhere."
"12175080","12176600"," The Senate couldn't do it before."
"12177100","12181860"," They asked the Fed to do it in those hearings, and the Fed explained that they didn't have the"
"12181860","12182600"," power to do that. "
"12183100","12184440"," So then it gets thrown back on the Senate."
"12186260","12193260"," One of the problems that we have, they don't get discussed enough about how QE operates is when the"
"12193260","12198520"," Fed's buying U.S. sovereign duration, they're paying the interest back to the Treasury at the end"
"12198520","12198980"," of every year."
"12199140","12202380"," So it's a huge discount mechanism on the cost of funding that debt. "
"12202720","12207880"," When they reverse that and rates go higher and they're not paying that interest back, and I'm"
"12207880","12211000"," imagining when they're talking about rolling off the balance sheet, they're talking about letting,"
"12211200","12215160"," first they're talking about letting treasuries mature, then they're talking about actual"
"12215160","12216100"," quantitative tightening."
"12216300","12219540"," They're talking about, you know, oh, the 30-year bond is going to buy a new bond."
"12219800","12223560"," So that's sort of passive tightening, and then there's the active tightening, where they actually"
"12223560","12225800"," start to sell off their balance sheet, right?"
"12225900","12230060"," So we're talking about the passive tightening right now with the roll off, and then that opens the"
"12230060","12234560"," door to the active tightening, where they actually start actively selling assets into the open"
"12234560","12234920"," market. "
"12235220","12239200"," So, you know, this is a problem because if the U.S. government thing, we're going to come out here,"
"12239200","12242200"," and we're going to do all the stimulus, where are you going to get the money?"
"12242700","12245060"," Foreign demand for U.S. debt is not healthy."
"12245520","12250280"," Domestic demand for U.S. debt is languishing, and one of the biggest buyers, I think 40%, was going"
"12250280","12251960"," to the Fed, and now they're saying we're done."
"12252340","12256060"," So the government doesn't have the fiscal elasticity to do these things. "
"12256420","12259580"," In fact, Build Back Never is now dead on arrival, in my opinion."
"12259820","12260560"," It's dead on arrival."
"12260560","12261400"," There's no way it's passing. "
"12261760","12263100"," Absolutely no way that it passes."
"12264520","12268240"," And you know what, you just saw the spike in the two, in the two-year as well."
"12269360","12270800"," Yeah, that's pricing. "
"12271160","12275280"," And that's pricing in that, that sort of tightening cycle as well."
"12276120","12279640"," You know, the two-year on the 30-year like this is not, this is not good."
"12280820","12284320"," No, no, this is, this is, I mean, really not flapping at all. "
"12284320","12287000"," I know, I know a lot of people try to stay."
"12287980","12291980"," They, you know, we're going to go late cycle, and we're going to have all these plays that are late"
"12291980","12295100"," cycle plays that we might go to run and like entertainment stuff like that."
"12295520","12300240"," Quite frankly, if they talk, if they really do what they're talking about, the end of this cycle is"
"12300240","12304300"," coming, like, by the second half of this year, if not earlier, it may even be that we've already"
"12304300","12304960"," peaked in the market. "
"12305740","12309880"," And, and that's something that I recommend everyone kind of take a moment to process because"
"12309880","12314040"," remember, the Fed blows the bubbles, the Fed also destroys the bubbles."
"12314420","12318740"," The bubble that we're in was entirely produced by synthetic liquidity from central banks around the"
"12318740","12318940"," world."
"12319240","12320740"," And when they pull that back, that ends it. "
"12320920","12325200"," And we can see that cycle in the, you know, the housing bubble and then the great financial crisis"
"12325200","12327160"," that followed is the same exact pattern of behavior."
"12327560","12329860"," And we could see it before in the dot com building bust."
"12330260","12336100"," The Fed tends to go too heavy in their stimulus and then they tend to go too hard in their"
"12336100","12337720"," removal of that stimulus. "
"12338240","12343180"," And we got to keep in mind, we're in this sort of four decade long debt super cycle is increasingly"
"12343180","12343740"," fragile."
"12344100","12348060"," You've got over $150 trillion of global debt that keys off the 10 year bond."
"12348680","12352960"," So, you know, when you start talking about pushing rates up across the yield curve, you start"
"12352960","12354760"," talking about a lot of insolvencies. "
"12354760","12360600"," You've got over 3,500 corporations that don't make money that can't finance their debt at higher"
"12360600","12360900"," rates."
"12361080","12367000"," So, you have a domino effect that could start to come on that in and of itself can build into"
"12367000","12367600"," a recession."
"12368240","12375080"," And then you also have the US government with the rates rising as they are on their debt, maybe"
"12375080","12378340"," tempted to try to push that funding to shorter-dated maturities. "
"12378580","12379440"," Well, what's that going to do?"
"12379560","12382960"," It's going to, it's going to increase the supply of the shorter-dated maturities when demand isn't"
"12382960","12386900"," rising commensurate with that, which has a yield curve flattening or even inversion effect."
"12387420","12391160"," So, there's a lot of not great things that come out of this conversation."
"12392760","12397600"," And in net net, you know, I am tempted to say that if they actually follow through with what"
"12397600","12403700"," they're saying, you know, they're kind of putting a, they're telling us that the bull market is"
"12403700","12406140"," ending, you know, if they go through with what they're saying. "
"12406380","12409880"," That's really what the net translation is on this policy statement."
"12410240","12411860"," I'm shocked at the other end of this."
"12411960","12413860"," They didn't discuss that, that side of it at all. "
"12414000","12418720"," I may assume that something, I realized that you're going to get a couple dumps and some set"
"12418720","12423620"," bottoms on tapering and rates."
"12424100","12433160"," But the money flow coming in, that, just the discussion of that ending should set fair, at least"
"12433160","12434920"," one fair sell-off into the market."
"12434920","12440300"," And then, of course, if that, if they follow through like you're saying at this point, at this"
"12440300","12443880"," point, if they follow through with that, you would see the end of the bull run 100%. "
"12443880","12445360"," I wonder what the drawdown is."
"12445480","12446380"," Is it 35%?"
"12446540","12447320"," Is it 50%?"
"12448300","12449640"," I mean, how deep does it go?"
"12449920","12451540"," Does it go 35%?"
"12451960","12457240"," Because I would expect that the worst this year would be that in the worst-case scenario, it's 10,"
"12457320","12458440"," 15 to 20%."
"12458440","12464940"," But if you do all sides of it, then the drawdown should be at least 35, if not 50. "
"12465260","12466080"," 50 is real bad."
"12466180","12469520"," 50 is, yeah, you're talking a real bad downward movement."
"12469680","12470960"," That's 2007, right?"
"12471120","12472200"," 2007, 2008. "
"12473560","12476180"," I don't remember what led up to that, right?"
"12476420","12482540"," It was, it was the Fed, under Bernanke getting really aggressive with rate hikes at its time when"
"12482540","12486260"," there was an enormous amount of leverage in the system, in particular, in mortgage-backed"
"12486260","12490580"," securities and credit default swaps and all this kind of stuff that was not really, the"
"12490580","12493860"," counterparties weren't funded to provide, you know, their end."
"12493980","12498080"," And then there was also just so much leverage in people holding mortgage-backed securities that"
"12498080","12499220"," were yielding 6%."
"12499220","12503080"," They thought they were a AAA, they're 10 to one leverage and I turned out they were paying on the"
"12503080","12505220"," dollar, you know. "
"12505520","12508960"," And the only thing that stopped that route, remember, it wasn't just QE."
"12509240","12513620"," It was FASB in 2009 in March, and this marked the 6, 6, 6 bottom in the S&P."
"12514000","12518200"," FASB came out and said, you know what, you got all that crap on your balance sheet, just market to"
"12518200","12518840"," whatever you want. "
"12519020","12522860"," And I started calling it, my euphemism for it was marked to make, believe it, by unicorns and"
"12522860","12523420"," rainbows everywhere."
"12524100","12529100"," You know, you got your MBS, oh, it's worth a penny here, we'll buy it for a dollar, right?"
"12529400","12534820"," And that's kind of what set the banks into being able to pretend that they were solving again."
"12534980","12539020"," The market took a U-turn, made a V-shaped bottom, which is very unusual for a real bottom. "
"12539200","12544360"," We saw that also in April of 2020, but it made that kind of V-shaped bottom on policy and"
"12544360","12546460"," QE came in and helped to provide that bid."
"12546460","12551620"," So this time, you know, we had a kind of similar dichotomy, which is to say, you know, the leverage"
"12551620","12556080"," doesn't exist as much in the housing market, but there's a ton of leverage in the equity market."
"12556320","12558420"," There's a lot of leverage and a lot of corporate balance sheets. "
"12558620","12564540"," There's a lot of leverage in sovereigns because sovereigns absorbed a lot of that, a lot of the"
"12564540","12569160"," problems that were happening to the great financial crisis and leveraged up in fiscal policy and"
"12569160","12570880"," then did so again during COVID."
"12571200","12576520"," And so there's just a lot of real fragile players across the entire credit market."
"12576980","12579140"," And so this is a shock to the system. "
"12579660","12584200"," And the question really becomes, does the Fed do what it does best?"
"12584460","12584940"," Do they pivot?"
"12585420","12587540"," Or do they do the other thing that they do best?"
"12588100","12590680"," Which is that they just overshoot, right?"
"12590800","12595600"," And that's really the question that we as traders and investors are going to be watching and really"
"12595600","12600600"," looking at over the next couple of weeks and months ahead of first clues as to whether or not a"
"12600600","12606120"," is the economy and the loss that you've inflation soften enough such that we can start to say,"
"12606280","12609540"," maybe they'll look at the data and say this is not the right course of action."
"12609960","12614580"," Well, on the other hand, does the Fed kind of blind itself to those macro, you know, like"
"12614580","12617040"," inflation's transitory when it clearly wasn't?"
"12617140","12618720"," Are they going to go flying blind again?"
"12619200","12624160"," You know, we're seeing the effects right now in some of these companies that you're talking about,"
"12624160","12627980"," these companies that are overleveraged with credit outstanding debt in their companies."
"12628260","12630100"," And of course, what they're going to be in the paying and rates. "
"12631900","12634460"," You can see it in SQ right now."
"12634540","12635360"," I can see it in IWM."
"12635640","12642980"," There's a there's some nasty, nasty put flow coming in on some small cap companies like Pins, IWM,"
"12644100","12649920"," Skills, any of these companies that were on edge, this is bad news for these companies without a"
"12649920","12650460"," doubt right now. "
"12650540","12652540"," You can see it come I can see the flow coming in right now."
"12654300","12656320"," I couldn't agree more my friend."
"12656320","12661940"," I think it's both what we're seeing in the flows, the words of the Fed and also these technicals, a"
"12661940","12666540"," lot of these charts have broken down, a lot of key levels on these tech and growth talks have been"
"12666540","12666860"," violated. "
"12667500","12671660"," You know, the big thing that I don't think really enough people have discussed because, you know,"
"12671720","12673180"," hey, it's been 12 years."
"12673380","12676120"," It's really been, you know, maybe you could call more like eight years of this, but you have these"
"12676120","12676860"," big tech companies."
"12677580","12678780"," They are high beta. "
"12679040","12681280"," They are more rate sensitive and they are the market."
"12681700","12683640"," 40% of the NASDAQ is the top five holdings."
"12683880","12688420"," 25% of the S&P is the top five holdings and they're rate sensitive. "
"12688940","12691680"," And we're talking about So IWM, that's in trouble."
"12691860","12699040"," IWM just came in with a put for $4.3 million at $2.10p for February 18th."
"12699300","12701180"," That is not good to be seeing. "
"12701700","12703100"," This isn't for 2023."
"12703580","12706040"," You're seeing major spy puts coming in right now guys."
"12706720","12714480"," You guys XME puts, CLF puts coming in, Baba puts coming in, OMF, major flow coming in right now"
"12714480","12719080"," against the market specifically targeting tech, specifically targeting IWM. "
"12719480","12720440"," Be careful out there."
"12720600","12724360"," If you're looking at any of these big tickers that are holding up the market, like the apples out"
"12724360","12729900"," there, the apples out of threat right now, absolutely 100%, especially with what markets from"
"12729900","12731040"," mayhem is saying at the moment."
"12732660","12736000"," Yeah, we really got to be careful on any of that kind of stuff. "
"12736180","12741260"," Anything that has a lot of debt on its balance sheet, even if it's in the, you know, like marathon"
"12741260","12746640"," oil was a big runner in 2021, number two on the S&P, but they have about eight times as"
"12746640","12747340"," much debt as cash."
"12747940","12751640"," So even though they're benefiting from rising oil price, they have to refinance that debt at a"
"12751640","12752480"," potentially higher cost."
"12752480","12753700"," So you've got to look at everything. "
"12754140","12755900"," And now we've got to look at it in a completely different way."
"12756040","12759400"," Like what's going to happen with AT&T, even though they're getting out of all of this debt, they"
"12759400","12760920"," still have an inordinate amount of debt."
"12761380","12764980"," You know, IBM, they've restructured a bit, but they still have a dividend. "
"12765000","12766080"," They're funding with debt."
"12766360","12770760"," You've got a lot of companies that were even becoming darlings in this sort of rotation back into"
"12770760","12775940"," value that are not safe bets here because of the leverage implied by their balance sheet and"
"12775940","12781940"," because of really diminishing growth, they're not able to offset the price by the lack of growth"
"12781940","12782420"," that they have."
"12782600","12784540"," So, you know, somewhere, something's got to give. "
"12785200","12787980"," You know, obviously, you know, it's early on in all this."
"12788260","12791180"," So we're looking at this, just interpreting the minutes as we see it."
"12791200","12795120"," We do have another Fed meeting later this month until March. "
"12795360","12797840"," So we're going to possibly see some more information about that."
"12797880","12801360"," I'm sure the press is going to ask how a lot more about how this balance sheet roll off and,"
"12801400","12803480"," you know, flirting into QT is going to look."
"12803900","12808220"," But, you know, this has a very strong risk off deal across the board. "
"12808440","12808960"," I mean, look at volatility."
"12809560","12809740"," Volatility."
"12810040","12811420"," You get up pretty hard today, too. "
"12812020","12814540"," Well, we've got Apple crashing through support right now at 176."
"12815400","12818280"," You've got some minor support at 175, 174."
"12818920","12824800"," And then you've got a free fall below that and the 171, 171, 170, basically. "
"12825540","12827300"," That's a big move for Apple in one day."
"12827540","12834620"," Apple was at 183, 39, two days ago and is now down to 176.21 at the moment."
"12835320","12839420"," And so you can see for sure, oh, yeah, a cup of tea coffee, please. "
"12840040","12841300"," Don't come across the camera."
"12841720","12842700"," Thank you very much."
"12843900","12847820"," You can see right now that Apple's taking a hit. "
"12847960","12851780"," I mean, this is certainly risk off for the big for the heavy hitters that are holding the market"
"12851780","12851940"," up."
"12852060","12856520"," And Amazon was at the bottom of that bullish channel that they've been for the whole year, right?"
"12856660","12858140"," I wonder what Amazon's doing right now."
"12858900","12859980"," They're down only 46. "
"12860900","12866480"," But Apple itself specifically is, we know that Apple's holding up a lot of the market right now,"
"12866680","12867160"," MSFT."
"12867780","12870460"," Who are the group of stocks that were part of that?"
"12874140","12877280"," The bond purchasing, the corporate debt bond purchasing."
"12877780","12880020"," We know that Apple was in there, MSFT was in there. "
"12880500","12881720"," And there were two or three others, weren't there?"
"12882660","12883060"," Yeah."
"12883560","12883560"," Yeah."
"12883780","12887860"," And they're also, you know, the funny thing about a lot of that is they're using that debt to buy"
"12887860","12892440"," back their own shares, which creates a very, it's a feedback loop. "
"12892660","12896840"," If you have a situation where rates are rising and stocks are falling, then all of a sudden it"
"12896840","12901260"," becomes a lot more difficult to not only pay back that debt, but also you have the potential that"
"12901260","12904600"," you actually need to start selling off your shares to pay back that debt and some of the companies"
"12904600","12906980"," that are more leveraged and die in less liquid."
"12907320","12911260"," I want to see which companies were wrapped up in that whole thing."
"12912060","12913240"," And back in May..."
"12913240","12919400"," Apple, it's in 2014 and Apple, they've reduced their flow by 40% with all their share buybacks as"
"12919400","12921480"," one of the staggering examples in Big Tech. "
"12922060","12926640"," And that of course has the weird effect of, you know, compressing multiples."
"12926820","12929080"," It makes it look like they're earning better than they really are."
"12929240","12932500"," It makes the stock look cheaper than it really is, and the reality is quite the opposite. "
"12933340","12935260"," Yeah, there's a couple of the companies involved."
"12935620","12937900"," I don't know Amazon was wrapped up in that deal as well."
"12938220","12939220"," They weren't, they weren't. "
"12939700","12942860"," Amazon's actually one of the few that hasn't been aggressively buying back their own shares."
"12943220","12945540"," They're not selling off as steeply as I would have expected."
"12945960","12950960"," They're targeting the companies that were taking taking the bonds are being purchased in. "
"12951500","12953500"," You see, I got to look to see what they were."
"12953820","12958960"," And dare I say that someone had some hint of this because we saw a lot of this kind of"
"12958960","12960600"," pattern selling really start on Monday."
"12963040","12964740"," Yeah, to an extent we did. "
"12965300","12970380"," You know, my biggest concern today was it was definitely that we the only the only real or the only"
"12970380","12975220"," real news that I'm looking for for true negative on the market is going to be turning the money"
"12975220","12975720"," supply off."
"12975760","12982160"," We already know about for me, we already know I was expecting down the road the aggressive tapering"
"12982160","12984460"," to cause a fall in the market."
"12984880","12989920"," I expected that more closer to February, March, and then the tapering as well will cause another"
"12989920","12990220"," dip. "
"12990620","12992480"," So we'll see that tapering start thereafter."
"12992640","12998260"," But the one thing that I was or that I'm that we don't know about is do they turn the"
"12998260","12999000"," money flow off?"
"12999660","13001740"," And today they said differently, right?"
"13001880","13004680"," Today was today was much different than when they taught."
"13004900","13009580"," I think they touched upon it in the last in the last of FMC, but they were very light on"
"13009580","13010100"," that subject. "
"13010620","13012540"," And that was really the one that I was looking for."
"13012760","13015000"," And that one we're hearing that today, I'm bearish."
"13015080","13016520"," I mean, I'm bearish in the market at this point. "
"13017440","13021880"," There's no real there's no positive that I can see unless they do it unless they do what you say"
"13021880","13023680"," is the flip side of that coin, right?"
"13023940","13028100"," That would be where you get the market cools off and J.P.O. pops up and steps in and"
"13028100","13031560"," says something other than, you know, we're going to stop the money flow."
"13032180","13034280"," And that was some bad news this more."
"13034400","13042620"," I saw that news come out that the Senate was talking about passing a bill to to pump money into"
"13042620","13043140"," the system. "
"13043540","13047200"," You know that they couldn't do that when we're in that when the heights of COVID, they they they"
"13047200","13050000"," didn't have the political willpower to pass a bill like that."
"13050280","13054540"," They tried to pawn it off on Jerome Powell and the Senate hearings and Jerome Powell was like,"
"13054640","13055300"," look, my hands are tight."
"13055460","13059320"," It's not within my purview to do something like that because they were asking him to just give"
"13059320","13064220"," straight grants to Main Street because they weren't loaning money to Main Street because they knew"
"13064220","13069860"," that Main Street businesses, small caps, mid caps, mom, pop businesses, couldn't pay it back. "
"13070320","13070740"," So what happens?"
"13070980","13077140"," You take all these loans or these quasi loan grants out for a million bucks or less for a mom"
"13077140","13077980"," pop shop, right?"
"13078460","13080460"," And they know they can't pay them back ever again."
"13080760","13082900"," And if the rates go up, they can't pay them back ever again."
"13082900","13083440"," It's even worse. "
"13084140","13088500"," And so you know these businesses, the end result is that they're going to close since find a way to"
"13088500","13091100"," survive or they have to be find a way to give free money."
"13091420","13096000"," And they weren't able to give free money though the Fed wasn't able to give those grants away with"
"13096000","13096860"," no ties on them."
"13097020","13100620"," Pushed it back on the Senate and now the Senate's revisiting it right now. "
"13100840","13105640"," So what is this some kind of a play from the Democrats to say you got to vote for more"
"13105640","13105960"," Democrats."
"13106180","13108520"," We can pass this bill once the election comes."
"13108940","13112420"," But the elections are coming up in fall, right?"
"13112780","13114860"," The damage will already be done between now and then. "
"13115740","13120980"," If the damage is done to the stock market and to the United States, then you're going to see a"
"13120980","13121960"," push to replace."
"13122460","13123860"," In my view, that's what you'd see."
"13124060","13125140"," Nobody wants new taxes. "
"13125600","13129040"," If the damage is already done to the stock market, then then what do they care, right?"
"13129200","13130960"," We dump it and we start fresh again."
"13131800","13133680"," And that's my question is where are we at?"
"13134100","13136780"," 20%, 15%, 35%."
"13136780","13140940"," And you're talking about the speeding up of that process. "
"13141400","13147640"," Something that probably would have taken place in 2023, even into 2024, you're saying you could"
"13147640","13149500"," collapse that down into this year possibly, right?"
"13149720","13150720"," If they stopped the money supply."
"13151680","13153160"," I'm going to go out on a limb."
"13153360","13157280"," I'm going to say something that might sound very controversial, but I think if they actually go"
"13157280","13164820"," through with an accelerated paper, aggressive hiking and quantitative tightening that the entire"
"13164820","13166420"," COVID rally will be given back. "
"13166960","13169960"," Yeah, that makes sense."
"13170980","13176620"," And I also want to say to folks out there talking about crypto, that is the most vulnerable asset"
"13176620","13177600"," class out there."
"13177780","13178540"," It is pure beta. "
"13178980","13180840"," It is entirely liquidity."
"13181620","13186860"," It is, look, stocks aren't going to go to zero, but a lot of cryptos can."
"13187400","13193220"," And this is the exact type of environment where, let me go and give you guys some stats, just so"
"13193220","13196600"," it doesn't sound like I'm talking out of place here. "
"13197160","13202420"," But you got 2.189 trillion dollars in the crypto market."
"13202700","13206920"," There are 16,433 different tokens."
"13207640","13214060"," So just think about that for a how many of those are going to survive a normalized rate in"
"13214060","13214920"," liquidity environment?"
"13215320","13218460"," And I should add that none of them have existed in that environment. "
"13218840","13222120"," Bitcoin got started in 2008, but it really wasn't circulated."
"13222560","13223000"," It wasn't."
"13223000","13224720"," So like 2010 plus, right?"
"13225260","13228120"," So none of these things really existed, plus it was trading the penny. "
"13228340","13230120"," So it was like, how much further down was it going to go?"
"13230500","13233820"," So none of these things have existed in this type of paradigm."
"13234000","13235260"," This is entirely new."
"13235440","13236280"," It is entirely different. "
"13236900","13239400"," And a lot of people have said things like, it's a store value."
"13239680","13240280"," No, it's not."
"13240540","13241480"," It's a hedge against inflation. "
"13242100","13242700"," No, it's not."
"13242980","13244720"," It's going to be the new currency of the world."
"13244980","13250820"," If you want to pay capital gains, short, long term, and trap them on every single transaction you"
"13250820","13254280"," do, I guess maybe, but then you got to find a counterparty that's willing to take it. "
"13254700","13258480"," And so this is a perfect storm for crypto."
"13258700","13263980"," I would not be surprised if it gets hurt more than other asset classes here, because they're really"
"13263980","13265560"," the primary driver for crypto."
"13265760","13269180"," I like to call it a hyper speculative relief valve for excess liquidity. "
"13269880","13272040"," And so what happens when that excess liquidity isn't there?"
"13274440","13278280"," So my thought is the same as the Hunt Brothers in the 1970s."
"13278340","13280540"," I think you get the digital dollar at some point."
"13280840","13285520"," The one thing that's scared me is the Build Back America or Build Back plan, wherever it's being"
"13285520","13287040"," called. "
"13287040","13292100"," They're talking about finding out all of your transactions, right?"
"13292100","13295300"," You're going to be able to see all of your Bitcoin, all of your crypto transactions."
"13295760","13296820"," They're going to hunch it down."
"13297000","13303720"," The next step is that you basically in some form ban or regulate Bitcoin, or you force people to"
"13303720","13308260"," remove their money from that store of value, quote unquote, and move it into the digital dollar. "
"13308680","13312620"," And even if you don't, let's say it's still, let's say the Bitcoin is still allowed to be around."
"13313340","13317760"," If they pass some kind of a bill there where they can track your Bitcoin and your purchases and tax"
"13317760","13320320"," you on it, it's going to, it's going to put a dent in people."
"13320340","13321640"," It's going to hurt people, right?"
"13321920","13326080"," And you know, you've got simple people out there that will move their investments out of Bitcoin"
"13326080","13327820"," into the digital dollar. "
"13328180","13334400"," I don't know if the, I don't want the Build Back America plan to pass for that reason alone."
"13336240","13337500"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"13337560","13343860"," I also think the corporate tax hikes are problematic, especially given the backdrop happening, you"
"13343860","13347320"," know, with rates because tax hikes are essentially another form of rate increase. "
"13348020","13352260"," And so, you know, we talked about the problem of inflation, you know, we're already seeing all"
"13352260","13355600"," these different drivers are passing on cost increases to consumers."
"13355880","13360120"," If corporate tax hikes happen, they're just going to pass that on to consumers and their customers,"
"13360140","13360720"," you know?"
"13360980","13365520"," Well, then you've got long only hedge funds that are storing money in Bitcoin."
"13365920","13371920"," And then they're pulling that out to cover margin calls, basically, right?"
"13372060","13372700"," That's they're doing, right?"
"13372700","13374280"," They're covering margin calls with Bitcoin. "
"13377330","13383330"," It's this, it's this, it's this, it's the steamroller event that ultimately points towards Bitcoin"
"13383330","13384890"," losing value."
"13385070","13387610"," And Bitcoin's down right now, heavy, right?"
"13387790","13395690"," So Bitcoin's down about 4%, or currently 2.73, but it was down at four, one point, right?"
"13396070","13398190"," It's not at 44, 70, 50 right now."
"13399290","13403030"," So there is, you can see it impacting the market of the market right now. "
"13403710","13404590"," Let's look up Bitcoin."
"13404830","13410810"," I'm going to look up Bitcoin right now for the Bitcoin bros out there and see if they want to"
"13410810","13413090"," see where quote unquote bottom is."
"13414510","13416590"," You know, I don't have that connection on this menu. "
"13417210","13420470"," I'm going to have to look it up on my other one and see if I can find."
"13421390","13425570"," I have another, I have another book map on another computer here where I can check to see where"
"13425570","13426410"," bottom is in Bitcoin."
"13426930","13429130"," But it's not reacting very well right now. "
"13429130","13430470"," 44, 7, 3, 9."
"13432390","13435610"," And there's a stranglehold on how fast you can sell, right?"
"13437190","13437590"," Yeah."
"13437710","13439170"," And it's also not very illiquid."
"13439390","13440050"," The spreads are wide. "
"13440250","13443870"," I mean, I've, I've traded crypto enough to know I don't really like trading it unless it's a longer"
"13443870","13444550"," time horizon."
"13445210","13448410"," Because if you're trying to get in and out pretty quickly, the spreads are going to eviscerate you."
"13448570","13449730"," You're going to just bleed it. "
"13451030","13455450"," I want to see if there's even a wall up here where a target seller is at 480 if they're"
"13455450","13455990"," too down."
"13457390","13463390"," So the sellers up at 480 on the spy have come straight down to cell 471."
"13463990","13467350"," If any of you guys are logged out there right now, it's very risky to be logged in the market"
"13467350","13471830"," unless unless unless JPAL comes out and says something different. "
"13473410","13478650"," Yeah, and really like at this point, the fed can't pivot without bad macro."
"13479070","13481710"," I mean like they're kind of boxed in."
"13481710","13486690"," If we don't have a really bad like GDP trend or employment trend or some other kind of really"
"13486690","13491030"," important number or like a really low inflation trend, they've kind of tied their hands and are"
"13491030","13492010"," already losing credibility. "
"13492730","13497630"," So if it's going to be really important, you know, if we are to see any pivot that there's a"
"13497630","13499750"," catalyst to the macro level for that to happen."
"13500090","13503930"," And another thing that I think is worth mentioning that I found very interesting is the Chinese"
"13503930","13507930"," Central Bank last night began draining liquidity after their dovish tilt."
"13508250","13510490"," So they had been injecting liquidity into the system. "
"13511310","13516690"," Their central bank chief had been saying in his name is E-Gang, he had been saying that he was"
"13516690","13522070"," going that the central bank was going to continue to accommodate and continue to provide surplus"
"13522070","13526530"," liquidity to the Chinese markets to try to cushion any blows from Evergrande and other real estate."
"13526970","13531270"," And they started injecting 90 billion won one day the next day the next day."
"13531630","13535710"," And then for two days in a row, they withdrew 200 billion or more yuan. "
"13536470","13539950"," Didn't they prop up Evergrande with 172 billion or something like that?"
"13541010","13541910"," Yes, yes."
"13542110","13545190"," And they took a stake in another company that's now become a third state owned."
"13545470","13547390"," That was another insolvent real estate company. "
"13547550","13551310"," And guys, you know, you got to remember the Chinese real estate markets, the biggest market in the"
"13551310","13554290"," entire world of all markets of any kind."
"13554590","13555950"," It is the biggest by far."
"13556150","13557450"," I think it's like $90 trillion. "
"13558410","13560350"," And a lot of that is leveraged."
"13560710","13567210"," So there are high consequences in China if they don't ring the fence that debacle as well."
"13567630","13573090"," And as the Fed tightens, you know, what happens in the United States and so far as monetary policy"

"14755020","14759780"," you got the v-wops up here at 473 78 so you're going to look for some rejection up there"
"14759780","14769750"," as well yeah yeah there's this is not good that's a nice print by the way everybody's was funny"
"14769750","14775590"," because earlier today we were talking about i said the last three of these fomc's the meetings and"
"14775590","14780250"," the minutes everyone was everyone was on the short side of the trade everyone was on the the put"
"14780250","14784170"," the long put side of the trade and the short side of the trade so i took the long call"
"14784170","14789310"," side of the trade and won all three times that was we're talking about it coming up today i said"
"14789310","14794950"," whoa i said you know it's really weird everybody knows today that we're going up everybody's long"
"14794950","14799910"," right here in this fomc minutes meeting when you should be taking the the short side of the trade"
"14800660","14807350"," and the 473s right those 473 puts that were at 15 cents we talked about earlier let's see where"
"14807350","14814490"," they're at right now let's see let's see what the print is on those bad boys let's see what the"
"14814490","14824370"," print is on those on those puts right now so the 473 15"
"14824370","14834170"," cent puts are now worth $2.56 wow $2.56"
"14834170","14844650"," we talked about those earlier today a whole bunch of people jumped in on them another"
"14844650","14849690"," leg down here a double bottom uh you might see a small relief rally to sell off into the overnight"
"14849690","14856530"," you could see some dealers buying futures but that's a tough one that's a tough one that the"
"14856530","14860930"," dealers are going to be buying futures we have some real negative news out there i don't know that"
"14860930","14864670"," it's worth it it might you let's say the dealers buy futures we have a little bit of a rip"
"14864670","14869350"," but then you get right into the six o'clock hour four o'clock well let's say four o'clock"
"14869350","14874830"," it begins and you just see more relentless selling before you can actually get into or get out of"
"14874830","14878990"," any kind of a relief rally i'd be really concerned about that heading into cash market tomorrow"
"14878990","14885470"," even if there is a really rally yeah i think that one of the things is that uh you know"
"14885470","14890570"," even if we do get a relief rally it's most likely going to be short-lived and sold into so"
"14890570","14897530"," you have to be super nimble to capture something like that yeah we taught we so so those 15 cents"
"14897530","14904070"," 270 that that was that that was the contrarian trade right there 15 or 30 we had 15 cent 473"

"14915890","14924370"," calls that were at 478 worth one penny now worthless worthless the put side nobody was in the put"

"14969030","14973010"," the trade today trade the opposite of what everybody knows everything is going into this today"
"14973010","14977990"," right you know that everybody was long today if this we have it worked three times but the fourth"
"14977990","14983690"," time everybody knows the markets going up you know that it's going the opposite way and it has a"
"14983690","14988190"," lot something to do with the news that's coming up but someone has to do with the where where the"
"14988190","14992550"," market is right but everybody knows something's going to happen it usually goes the other way"
"14992550","14998610"," exactly and we had yesterday the Wall Street Journal floated a trial balloon on behalf of the Fed"
"14998610","15003730"," talking about quantitative tightening so we knew that you know there was some potential that that"
"15003730","15007210"," was going to be something we were going to hear more about in the near future or we had no"
"15007210","15012230"," cash card you make a comment where you know he's the most dovish member of the Fed and he came"

"15033310","15038970"," the close i think you got panic sellers stepping in i think i think they sweat a lot of this"
"15039710","15045170"," yeah i mean there's a lot of stops that got triggered on that action that volatility really damaged"
"15045170","15052970"," a lot of people margin calls go out at three thirty right is that what time on your broker right"
"15052970","15058430"," so so some brokers start that process at two pm others do it around three thirty some do it just"

"16053210","16060290"," we remember that everybody knew the market was falling right these are simple trading strategies"
"16060290","16067590"," right everybody knew the market was falling and so I took longs right traded the contrarian trade"
"16067590","16076930"," then this time you see the markets everybody's long this market heading into FOMC minutes right and"
"16076930","16086170"," a complete flip of the last three FOMCs right so you're taking the contrarian trade and it prints"
"16086170","16091610"," the same as the as the last four on the opposite side of that trade right and then we even"
"16091610","16098490"," offer up a straddle right you straddle the market so that no matter which direction it heads in"
"16098490","16105630"," it's still going to print right and we ended up trading down at this point and it didn't matter"
