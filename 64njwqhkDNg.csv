"60","4940"," A big part of the picture going forward and how we solve some of these issues that we've been"
"4940","8720"," living with in terms of low investment and low productivity as well."
"9400","13840"," Trip Haller, do you think we've been over reliant actually on monetary policy, especially as a Fed?"
"14380","15059"," Yes, I do."
"15260","22340"," I would just say I think that in economic discussion generally there's much too much focus on"
"22340","31119"," demand management and not enough on things that will make us grow at the maximum sustainable level,"
"31119","32880"," sustainable growth in the longer run. "
"33040","34040"," There's not enough focus on that."
"34120","38100"," And that isn't the Fed's job, that's more the job of, again, elected governments, but I'd like to"
"38100","38580"," see more of that."
"38880","41520"," So how should governments be thinking about their economic policy?"
"41620","42040"," Do you?"
"42140","43680"," You guys even hear, can you guys hear me?"
"43840","44780"," Let me know if you can hear me. "
"44960","48120"," If, you know, if monetary policy is not going to be going down."
"49060","49680"," You're asking me that?"
"50080","50480"," Good morning."
"52420","55740"," I'm kind of out of the business of giving advice to the festival. "
"55880","56680"," Do you have the idea that I was on?"
"56720","63000"," So I would just say, I think it, when I get asked, I find it, what I say is focus"
"63000","66980"," on investing in people and investing in things that will increase the productive capacity."
"66980","68040"," Do you have to focus on where?"
"68280","69100"," That's what I say."
"69420","76900"," And in terms of, I think what a central bank should do is stick to its job and leave the"
"76900","78680"," nature of the way to the elected representative. "
"79600","80620"," You guys are hilarious."
"81760","82700"," Good morning, everybody."
"83260","84480"," So you got Jay Powell in the background. "
"84600","85520"," We have to stick to our knitting."
"85800","86300"," That's for sure."
"86480","87480"," We are all. "
"87700","88260"," Good morning, everybody."
"88460","88920"," We should give it."
"88920","89480"," We should give it. "
"89620","90140"," I think that."
"90440","91360"," I've been in the office much."
"91580","91860"," I've been in the office. "
"91860","92120"," I've been in the office much."
"92120","92940"," I've been in the office."
"93400","94500"," And I've been working on it. "
"94940","95680"," And to good effect."
"95880","97980"," So I'm like trading while working on this house."
"98500","102160"," How fiscal can leverage what we do in our community. "
"102720","103040"," We need it."
"103340","103480"," Let me."
"103560","106100"," This is, this is no longer the same. "
"106100","109840"," We post this video and it works that we used to do that."
"109840","111100"," Some reason I didn't post publicly."
"111260","111600"," I don't know why. "
"111880","113200"," I would give the same advice."
"113240","114680"," Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
"115200","121700"," We targeted and focused and in the medium term, you know, the fiscal space has to be just one quick"
"121700","122280"," second here. "
"122560","128300"," You know, made sustainable for all countries, certainly in the your area."
"128500","128820"," There we go."
"128940","129259"," Post this. "
"129600","133940"," It's a correct way of fiscal policy to help monitor."
"134920","138640"," Well, I would definitely ask."
"138680","140320"," Are you guys to see something that is resistance?"
"140840","141100"," Let's start. "
"141340","142400"," Let me just one second here."
"142400","147880"," But I would say more in different aspects that enhance the human capabilities."
"148300","149240"," Very specific. "
"149580","150900"," We'll be okay from this one."
"151520","157260"," I think what we have learned with the pandemic is that health systems are extremely important."
"157680","161680"," And I think to a large extent, we have under invested invested there. "
"162860","171520"," The other thing is that or just one quick thing, we close this out, a willing to imply a"
"171520","172240"," technology."
"172780","172860"," Okay."
"172860","173340"," So, welcome back. "
"173560","178900"," We will really impose very, very dramatic."
"179280","179520"," Good morning."
"179660","180180"," How's everybody doing?"
"180720","181140"," Great out there. "
"181300","182140"," You guys can hear me just fine."
"182360","184180"," I hope you guys can hear Jay about in the background."
"185000","186080"," And I think I think. "
"186080","188440"," Jay Ross, they heard a cat back, please."
"188640","189220"," That was an extensive."
"189440","190140"," It's very important. "
"190480","190720"," Very much."
"190920","192000"," Turn down the news feeds."
"192280","193580"," That is the answer. "
"193880","194500"," Thank you."
"195000","195680"," Many parts of the world."
"195680","195980"," Thank you. "
"196040","196280"," Thank you."
"196280","197280"," Thanks for giving us a wrap."
"197580","202160"," I think ladies, females into the labor force. "
"202320","204340"," I'm going to mute that right now just for a moment as well."
"204560","204980"," Not just that."
"205120","205480"," You're normally. "
"206180","207260"," So I rebooted."
"207400","215400"," I had to redo the OBS and I haven't done the plugin yet that I'll mute the background talking of"
"215400","216800"," the newscast."
"217040","220500"," But first off, good morning to all of you that are out there right now. "
"220680","221260"," Good to see you all."
"221600","222660"," I've missed all of you guys."
"224300","226760"," So let's just do some quick catch-up really quick, okay?"
"226980","229680"," Well, let's look at the market briefly here. "
"231360","234420"," And we'll just look on the small screen over here on the left-hand side."
"235260","241060"," I'll just want you guys to see where what you guys to see where support is."
"241540","243220"," Let me see if I can bring it up somewhere else. "
"244240","245720"," I'll bring it up over here."
"248780","253800"," Okay, so just so you know out there, if you don't know, support for today is at 380."
"255019","256800"," We've got some wonkiness up here. "
"257040","262120"," It's like 383, 385, somewhere where I see my cursor, some resistance here."
"263020","269620"," And this target above a 390 is probably 388, probably not that high at 390."
"269940","270960"," So we'll lower that one there. "
"273430","278770"," And this 383, it's 385, but it's somewhere between 383 and 385."
"279150","281670"," We need to break through that to get to 388, 390."
"281970","285850"," And I'll show you later on heat map or book map where why that's there, why it's like that above. "
"286590","287290"," Can we get to 390?"
"288430","289150"," Yeah, it's possible."
"289870","291650"," We're building up a reason here to go higher."
"291870","293190"," We traded as low as 378. "
"293910","300050"," Yesterday I think I tweeted that we should go down to 377, 378, 43 seems right."
"300310","304830"," You know, sometimes they'll still swing it back down, nail that bottom down here."
"305110","306690"," You can see as two down below. "
"307470","311390"," We're going to talk about a post that I made last weekend."
"311790","313850"," And then this morning I gave an update in that post."
"314170","318990"," And of course we did fail above and traded back down at some point. "
"319290","320110"," So we'll go through all that."
"320210","321570"," We've got a bunch of stuff to talk about."
"321890","324730"," And we're going to talk about why we are where we are on the market. "
"325030","325890"," We got so much stuff."
"325990","327470"," It's hard for me to put this stuff on Twitter."
"328770","332070"," So I've been about a house and I haven't been in my office. "
"333610","335170"," And I've been working on this house."
"335410","336530"," I didn't want to do a ton of work."
"336670","341250"," Now I'm fully wrapped up and doing work on this on this project. "
"341550","343550"," So it's what it's whatever it is."
"344870","346690"," So I'm just I'm very busy right now."
"346750","350770"," So it's hard for me to be consistent with what I'm putting out. "
"350990","353490"," And that's not that's not the good that's a good thing to be."
"354410","358650"," So anyways that's so if you don't if you want to know where some resistance levels are three eighty"
"358650","360390"," five is the technical resistance."
"360810","362990"," Three eighty three and some changes where it begins. "
"363110","367150"," You need to break through this to get higher to this three eighty eight three ninety level above"
"367150","367410"," here."
"367490","370110"," So this is kind of a moving target right here."
"370190","370370"," Okay. "
"370430","373470"," So be aware of that as we look towards the rest of the day."
"374790","377850"," Now on the bottom left hand side of the right hand side is to screen."
"378190","379230"," I just had to reload. "
"379290","383070"," So what I do is I wait for windows to on my on my desktop."
"383690","388070"," So I had to do I just downloaded book map once again."
"388370","390010"," I haven't messed with it at all. "
"390010","392370"," It's just sitting here running here."
"392450","394950"," I got to do a bunch of I got to tinker with it a bunch."
"395310","397510"," So there's no need to look at book map as well right here. "
"397890","399750"," We had a little bit of resistance here and here."
"400390","403510"," You can see following my cursor that resistance above."
"403770","407630"," There is some firm support down here at three seventy three seventy nine. "
"407630","408970"," You can take a look at that real quick."
"409190","412390"," You can see this nice support that's setting up right now."
"412810","413530"," Intraday support. "
"414590","415450"," Looking lower."
"415670","417410"," I'm not seeing much right down below."
"417810","422110"," You can see this three seventy six is showing up and then three seventy and lower. "
"422870","424090"," Three sixty five."
"424610","429750"," And then our day with destiny down below of course at three fifty three right now."
"429770","434510"," I'm assuming that when we get down here whenever we hit that weekly moving average. "
"435650","437790"," And we're going to talk about that today at some point."
"438730","439950"," If we get some time."
"440570","442170"," If you want to know if you should be long here. "
"443210","444870"," There's no reason not to be long here."
"444990","446090"," There's nothing else coming out."
"446150","447570"," We didn't get bad GDP this morning. "
"447710","449970"," There's no reason for shorts not to lift up at this point."
"450930","457570"," We'll go on a more mid term and long term macro look at the market as to where we should"
"457570","458110"," trade to."
"458670","461770"," What should July look like and then also earnings season. "
"462290","467710"," I was talking about that in this post this morning how important that is for you guys as we head"
"467710","468330"," into July."
"469830","472750"," We're going to get just a preview of that conversation."
"473730","476270"," We're going to get some serious lows in July. "
"476970","479950"," My view is that we're going to get some serious lows in July."
"480350","482170"," We're setting up for serious lows in July."
"482710","485590"," I'm going to show you in Q one to how that worked itself out. "
"486390","495330"," So even regardless of where we wind up on on Q two or date on June 30th."
"495490","498730"," So it doesn't matter we wind up there."
"498890","500750"," It matters where they set the market. "
"501350","504950"," What they're setting these companies up where you can already see it as ER season started."
"505710","511049"," It really is walk the plank and we walk the plank in Q one as well."
"511610","513309"," Q one ER season pretty much. "
"514450","523730"," They set the indexes to you know steady as she goes and a slow grind down"
"523730","532070"," as the majors release their earnings statements and they made every company walk the plank and"
"532070","537470"," you've seen already that they've made companies walk the plank this past week."
"537490","539570"," You already seen that take place."
"540290","548090"," So it's a it's a challenge to trade this ER season and the other scary part of some of you"
"548090","551770"," guys remember out there back in Q one ER. "
"553700","561120"," Not only were they making you walk the plank but a lot of companies that were showing good earnings"
"561120","567760"," or you know beating expectations in their earnings which of course every every season they'd be by"
"567760","569200"," you know 30% of companies beat."
"569620","578580"," But the key in this this past Q one was that they oftentimes by open the next day had fucked"
"578580","583060"," you on your so I shouldn't have said to fuck already but they they kind of screwed you on any"
"583060","584480"," kind of options that you're in."
"586300","590660"," That's kind of bizarre they would screw the put screw the calls that that's already common anyways"
"590660","595340"," during ER season years ago ERs weren't as as important they're trying to get away from that I think"
"595340","602400"," we're also in a bear market and also but you know by open you couldn't really capture what your"
"602400","607200"," winnings you couldn't capture in this this ER season specifically Q one it was hard to even capture"
"607200","613360"," call spreads which is my preferred if I'm going to stay in past earnings call spreads normally"
"613360","618800"," bleeding up into earnings I'll be shorting or longing a stock and taking the winnings last couple"
"618800","626020"," days of a four earnings last day before earnings last couple days this this past Q one it was a"
"626020","632620"," real challenge so how do you play earnings for Q two in a bear market it's tough in all honesty"
"632620","639600"," to me it looks like yeah we'll trip well I'm going to show you that too in a larger time"
"639600","647900"," frame how they can take this market and trade it sideways and up the grind sideways and up for the"
"647900","655120"," beginning of July and then as these companies start reporting they can just trail it off into the"
"655120","661560"," end of July into OPEC's into the 30 I think it's the 31st in July could be wrong and they're"
"661560","666200"," being 31 days in July I'll take a look just to make sure I'm not fucking this up yes 31"
"666200","673320"," days in July but you know so in July you've got OPEC's I think is in the 15th I could"
"673320","683560"," be wrong on that date let me take a look at the July again I think it's 15th yeah"
"683560","690560"," the 15th for July and then the 30th I mean it's easy it's easy street to trade slightly up into"
"690560","698640"," the 15th then slightly down and then bleed bleed out into end of July OPEC's so and we're going to"
"698640","704460"," talk about the the technically technical reasons the fundamental fundamental and technical reasons"
"704460","710560"," why that should happen to technically in fundamental well well fundamentally we'll talk about too"
"710560","717460"," but there's option structure that's calling for this to happen and then whether you like it or not"
"717460","725140"," I keep harping on this this weekly moving average you know at some point it I thought it would"
"725140","732080"," happen and was hoping it would happen in June at some point either we're going to trade down to the"
"732080","737180"," weekly moving average or the weekly moving average is going to trade up though not trade up but"
"737180","742460"," average up to wherever we are we're not going to outrun it it's just not going to happen and"
"742460","749080"," whether you're a bear or a bull you want to see that that meet up with the weekly moving average"
"749080","757220"," it's an important milestone for where we are and not only that it will usually historically not"
"757220","763400"," even just usually historically 99% of it not 90 like 90 90% of the time when we interact"
"763400","771880"," with that weekly moving average you usually see definitively a bounce and then it's a big trade"
"771880","778720"," higher big like if I was a bear and we bounced and confirmed that bounce once more you weren't"
"778720","787300"," confirmation we're going all-time highs there there's pretty much no other way up around it now if"
"787300","794880"," we bounce off the weekly moving average and then we don't confirm it and trade under it that's"
"794880","800540"," going to get ugly and if we break through the weekly moving average and reject it's going to get"
"800540","806500"," nasty ugly and we haven't been able to have we've been here now it's where at the end of June"
"806500","815060"," right we're coming in July 1st and you know six straight months of a down market and it would be"
"815060","824080"," a perfect milestone or keystone for where we're headed personally from looking at everything I mean"
"824080","831240"," I follow some guys out there they're trying to wrap their heads around or trying to you know thread"
"831240","841180"," a needle going back to the 1970s saying that you know there's it's not the same as 1970 it's"
"841180","846340"," not the same as 1974 and you look at you take take 20 20 of these reasons why we should"
"846340","852240"," burn the market down there's this one thread the needle why we should go up from here you know it's"
"852240","859220"," uh it's it's so complicated that you're like yeah okay if we do I'd rather still see the the weekly"
"859220","866260"," moving average to confirm that or not confirm it and we're at this point in the market where we"
"866260","872880"," have to see that and there's some macro stuff that shows that we should interact with it there's"
"872880","878240"," some macro stuff that you know you guys are always saying especially if you're a bull you're like"
"878240","886220"," well we need a reason to go up I mean outside of ending the Ukraine war outside of ending the"
"886220","892740"," uh or outside of ending QE that's your only other chance uh if i'll tell you what if you're a"
"892740","897960"," bull right and we bounce and confirm that bounce off the weekly moving average we're fucking"
"897960","903580"," heading up to all-time highs to to check there uh and that's a positive thing you're gonna see"
"903580","908660"," everybody come out and say we're fucking going all-time highs so you should want that as well at"
"908660","914180"," this point in the market uh it seems like it's deemed necessary at this point as well now let's"
"914180","920620"," talk uh brief let's switch back to today and into friday specifically in tomorrow and friday into"
"920620","927520"," thursday's opx if you're bullish here i do want you to know that uh you know with the what they"
"927520","932980"," could do not we're gonna we're gonna go into why we should trade sideways and down with this move"
"932980","937900"," that we made but even if we trade up into opx tomorrow so we say blast up three ninety four"
"937900","944620"," hundred often times when we do that in these situations that we're in today it's like the last 15"
"944620","951660"," minutes it's it's it's it's disgusting uh there's all kinds of trap bulls in here uh they're"
"951660","957280"," they're not gonna pay those uh calls out they're gonna burn all those calls heading into friday opx"
"957280","963980"," and more than likely a bunch of the calls that are in the first week at july and middle of"
"963980","967740"," july and that's that's part of that reason we'll talk about why we should be heading lower into"
"967740","975660"," july at some point i'm going to show you it previously and we have breaks like this you know last"
"975660","980080"," sunday i talked to you guys about words the regime hasn't changed it's a bear market rally it's"
"980080","988020"," what it is and once it breaks uh the past six months at least right every time we have broken"
"988020","995640"," one of these bear market rallies every single time that's not the end of the decline you don't"
"995640","1001700"," normally end up seeing like this break here uh that we had yesterday that huge decline it was weird"
"1001700","1008880"," it was funny because yesterday when we broke and we didn't hold three 3850 i started searching all"
"1008880","1013840"," the news outlets to find a reason and nobody could put together a legit reason as the day wore on"
"1013840","1019660"," and then this morning they gave bullshit reasons and you had talking heads you've got fin twit"
"1019660","1025280"," people all you got fucking people on youtube saying it's because of the economic news that came out"
"1025280","1031940"," yesterday it's not you don't have you just don't get breaks like that now the reality is that the"
"1031940","1039480"," volume that came into uh the june 16th or whatever it was nothing and then even when we started to"
"1039480","1045040"," raise up just the just a few just on sunday i was like last friday uh this past month it"
"1045040","1052100"," that's friday this past monday the market still didn't have a bid it was pure short covering into"
"1052100","1060440"," last friday pure so so the volume that did come in on last friday and this monday was basically"
"1060440","1066580"," just a couple just a i'm going to assume the three largest banks out there keeping this market"
"1066580","1072880"," afloat as long as possible just waiting to pull the fucking plank out from you or you know hang"
"1072880","1081380"," your ass out to dry or this market so that that danger in this market right now is real that"
"1081380","1088380"," danger in this market right now uh is hinting towards uh even though we're i think we're going up"
"1088380","1095100"," today and tomorrow but it's hinting towards uh something foundationally wrong or fundamentally"
"1095100","1102340"," wrong wrong somewhere that's not public knowledge it has to be something that has to do with with"
"1102340","1110640"," uh uh being over leveraged either in in crypto and it's just not public yet it's not just hey it's"
"1110640","1115120"," a bear market lasting on average nine months we're going to trade down in september december that"
"1115120","1121000"," stuff it there's something fundamentally going on somewhere that's not public knowledge uh that has"
"1121000","1126500"," a made public and it's either going to and they're waiting for it you can see it just and i"
"1126500","1133320"," love trading low volume pumps i'm a one of my favorite trades is trading long uh low volume pumps"
"1133320","1137340"," usually even when you lose the last trade the whole ride up you usually make a ton of money this"
"1137340","1141020"," this last one we made it i made a ton of money in this last one i lost some money"
"1141020","1148680"," on yesterday that i ended up as a matter of fact on yesterday i sold this yesterday and then looked"
"1148680","1154080"," for another buy-in here at 385 i bought this yesterday and lost a bunch of money bought some spread"
"1154080","1158920"," i got some spreads expiring on friday they should be okay if we can get above 385 but i got"
"1158920","1163760"," some uh three day calls for that there's a 48 i think that's a 48 call on tuesday for friday"
"1163760","1169860"," um uh for friday calls but i think those are gonna get burned down today at some point because uh"
"1169860","1177760"," the implied move is not to 400 coming into friday but with all that said uh with all that with"
"1177760","1189260"," all that said let's see it yeah"
"1189260","1196870"," earnings being fine is a good enough reason just fine yeah i like a condor i love condors around"
"1196870","1206190"," earning season um personally so anyways there is some something fundamentally wrong in the market"
"1206190","1212450"," you have to look at you you have to look at we've had six down months so you're going to"
"1212450","1218190"," get at least out of the three to six more months minimum uh you know it's the averages nine months"
"1218750","1223050"," but when you look back at all these when you look back on those averages we're more than likely"
"1223050","1231390"," going to do nine months possibly even 12 even if we get a nice ripper in here there's some"
"1231390","1238410"," expediency now to bear markets they're a little bit faster do i think there's a fed put uh yeah"
"1238410","1246290"," there's always a fed put somewhere uh and then this morning uh fad chair pao talking about how he's"
"1246290","1256030"," happy with the this morning uh so anyways i"
"1256030","1260670"," just want you to understand though that this market is being propped up at this moment where we are"
"1260670","1266250"," the key you guys don't need too many technical indicators for this stuff so that's my my point"
"1266250","1275330"," behind this conversation is uh you can just look at the bid in the market no one owns this market"
"1275330","1281270"," uh retail does not own this market uh day traders are trading this market scalpers are trading this"
"1281270","1286410"," market uh i i can't even say the bears are making a ton of money in this market because they"
"1286410","1290770"," don't know that it's when it's going to happen they can jump in for a day trade in the scalp"
"1290770","1296990"," uh but to be even calling when it rolls over it is a child yesterday to call that roll over"
"1296990","1302470"," yesterday i don't know but i'm sure someone out there is calling a roll over every day so they got"
"1302470","1307010"," a right one day but i think it was yesterday or when it would happen matter of fact i thought"
"1307010","1311510"," it was going to happen on monday and it didn't happen on monday i thought the roll over came on"
"1311510","1315630"," monday and then yesterday it came and i figured it would come monday and then continueate"
"1315630","1321350"," continueate the re continuation of it into tuesday but then that close on monday i bought that"
"1321350","1327670"," close and sold that open uh anyways my point though behind behind all of this is you can look at"
"1327670","1333690"," just some basic things the market is being held up uh by a very small very small concentration of"
"1333690","1338230"," big money they can pull this market and uh they can pull the rug in this market whenever they feel"
"1338230","1346490"," like it uh and that shows in how much we fell yesterday on no uh but truly material news uh"
"1346490","1354890"," for such a large decline and that persists even today that persists us being down uh here where we"
"1354890","1360510"," are right now we're at 378 right now right so 362 i want to bring this this chart back up"
"1360510","1365830"," to you i want you i want you to key in on this it's just looking in this area right"
"1365830","1371990"," here okay there was no bid heat limit and we got some for some reason to get the wrong color"
"1371990","1379690"," here uh there was no bit wait a minute here what the hell is going on what that green what"
"1379690","1386150"," that yellow green what that nasty green uh i don't like that nasty green hold on here said i turned"
"1386150","1392590"," off my my my god damn it we'll deal with this one for right now we'll just use this bullshit"
"1392590","1398450"," all right that's that works um the key i'm trying to make to you is that down in here oh"
"1398450","1406690"," jesus christ shouldn't be swearing the cushions are taking over so down here it's what you just see"
"1406690","1412550"," right that down here there was no bid in here this is all short covering the only bid that came"
"1412550","1419070"," into the market was right here uh so even today with it's all suspect here everything that we have"
"1419070","1425890"," down in here is suspect none of this registered uh in the market breadth this is all pure short"
"1425890","1430250"," covering down here so you got a little bit of light just down in here you got a little bit"
"1430250","1436010"," of light uh big banks that own this outside of that nobody owns this there's nobody in here that"
"1436010","1442810"," owns this this right here wasn't trap buyers this was just this was just price coming back down to"
"1442810","1446590"," where it was they have a cut like three they guess i don't think everybody understand what i was"
"1446590","1455410"," trying to say was uh that this was an inflated price right and we came back down here uh there's"
"1455410","1459430"," nobody trapped it was i guess maybe there's some day traders trapped in here uh something like that"
"1459430","1464690"," but the real money big money isn't trapped in here this is a very small money in this market right"
"1464690","1469970"," now uh there's this market is holding on by a thread right now and come down anytime so later on"
"1469970","1473810"," this afternoon before end of the day we're going to talk about uh projections of where the market"
"1473810","1479550"," to go i've got a ds chart and an spx chart that i'll show you guys and better detail where"
"1479550","1483410"," i expect us to go on the month of july and where we're going to head to in the month"
"1483410","1488650"," of july so i'm going to turn some other stuff back on here and put the whole and the"
"1488650","1500400"," ecb form"
"1500400","1505440"," is over it turns some of the stuff off here and we'll get to some of your some of your"
"1505440","1535520"," questions and stuff like that all right"
"1535520","1545460"," who's here ben godfrey's here yeah so let's talk about the layout real quick let me"
"1545460","1549200"," go to uh i can't see i might get you guys on top chat instead of live chat good to"
"1549200","1558450"," see you ben godfrey let me see here i'll just kept dodging key questions about if that put"
"1558450","1564690"," relates to the velocity and how early a move is and not a price target yes it is about uh"
"1566670","1574870"," a fed put does relate to velocity and how orderly the move is uh and is not a price target"
"1574870","1582330"," i agree with that and disagree with that uh what else do you get here but uh velocity is key"
"1582330","1586570"," on that too i good to see all you guys today so the so the new layout here is what"
"1586570","1592190"," we got we've got a put them up in the right hand so we get some news in the background"
"1592190","1597830"," we've got some options slow down here to see the intraday moves on the bottom left hand side you"
"1597830","1605390"," got my pretty face my ugly mug and then in the background i'm watching the vix here in the"
"1605390","1614010"," background real quick so that you watch the the vix bleed off i was interested in excel what was it"
"1614010","1621050"," looking at today xalee was a kick-ass move monday tuesday talked about that on sunday uh we've got"
"1621050","1626830"," we've got it looks like right now we've got yeah 3d8 still up there you want you to see this"
"1626830","1636070"," r2 up here as a price target above 3d8 shaping up nicely today 3d7 30 showing up here r2 above"
"1636070","1643310"," so an intraday high at the most i'm looking for 3d8 and 3d3 of course is that resistance we were"
"1643310","1655400"," looking at uh earlier here more buyers than sellers right now in the market yeah"
"1655400","1658420"," i get to see you guys saying if they start to see limit upper limit down out of the fed"
"1658420","1665960"," put hello yeah so it's time we'll wait what winky was saying so it is velocity so the fed put"
"1665960","1675180"," comes into play if we limit down there's also a market point right so the market traded down to 220"
"1675180","1681380"," 260 you would see a fed point or there's a people are saying you'll see a fed put at that"
"1681380","1689840"," point so there's two ways to get to a fed put uh but yes you could see qe and that"
"1689840","1694760"," that's the key of like if you saw if you saw let's say you saw us melt down from the"
"1694760","1702400"," next week or two down to 320 you'd more than likely see a fed put come into play uh so"
"1702400","1707960"," i think it's somewhere right around uh 320 for the first one and you we've seen in the past you've"
"1707960","1713720"," seen the fed i don't know how many guys have been trading for that long but i've watched the fed"
"1713720","1717220"," uh put come out like a week later i don't know if it's a week but maybe what if i"
"1717220","1722800"," recall has been years but uh one month they'll they'll slam the market that they used to and then"
"1722800","1731020"," the moment that the market crashed uh the fed they would come out do a public uh fed put uh"
"1731020","1737220"," some people say there's no fed put anymore that i don't believe that for a minute so i think they"
"1737220","1743380"," have a price in mind for time and i think they also have like uh winky so you know it's"
"1743380","1753260"," uh factually that there's a velocity as well uh they'll put the brakes on and i'm expecting a run"
"1753260","1759180"," today uh no not so the key the key point for today would be oh well i'm gonna bring up"
"1759180","1768100"," so i'm gonna bring up what you guys should be expecting here usually usually let me uh sign in over"
"1768100","1781620"," here on my trading view app here so usually let me give you a five-day trade here usually"
"1785040","1789560"," it's just for my fear of five minutes time we are expecting comments from ecb's president the guard"
"1789560","1799080"," giving closing remarks at the uh at sennatra at the ecb forum so you have this consolidation move"
"1799080","1804460"," here right so that is to uh ecb's president the guard speaking in Portugal there challenges for"
"1804460","1811020"," monetary policy and rapidly changing well just giving closing remarks there move higher right oh it"
"1811020","1818300"," may pull in here you've got this consolidated well i guess that was over there here this"
"1818300","1825580"," consolidation move here right you get this move higher now you would think here we would have sold"
"1825580","1834580"," down right on monday and we didn't and what what happens is this ends up killing all these puts"
"1834580","1839460"," let's see you buy puts on friday you got a fake dip down here and then we continued to consolidate"
"1839460","1845440"," one more thrust higher then came down does that make sense so you you end up you know buying puts"
"1845440","1851840"," over here and it takes you two three days for those to print out right and you have some some"
"1851840","1856780"," fakes in here and you have to keep rebying these puts together in the print the same thing tends to"
"1856780","1860280"," happen with anyone that was long so if everyone is long in here let's say people got long here"
"1860280","1866280"," let's see if you've got calls over here right but they'll wind up doing the market makers will wind"
"1866280","1874200"," up doing as they'll end up destroying these calls into friday does not matter if we continue to go"
"1874200","1882540"," up so let's say let's say we go into friday or not excuse me thursday not friday um we're gonna"
"1882540","1889860"," we're gonna look here for for uh yeah nice little one nice little beautiful bite out here if you"
"1889860","1895640"," wanted to buy some calls for friday do you think we're gonna rip cap uh i don't i think that"
"1895640","1903020"," what'll happen is that we're going to consolidate and continue to burn calls into into thursday and"
"1903020","1907580"," then you'll see that move higher this as candidate is in talks european partners including spain in"
"1907580","1916280"," germany about how to step up energy exports from the east coast four opex if that's at 390 even if"
"1916280","1921360"," it was at 400 higher i don't think we get that high but let's say it was you would still"
"1921360","1926460"," wouldn't you would you still wouldn't see the full move this does follow a headline we got uh one"
"1926460","1931740"," minute to one uh one minute past one sorry yesterday June 28th the german government official"
"1931740","1937420"," saying that germany is in negotiations with canada about building an lng terminal on canada's east"
"1937420","1943760"," coast to export to europe you can even see a trade down into friday and then that move up to"
"1943760","1949740"," 400 on the 30th so what what happens is you don't get paid for for your lungs in here you"
"1949740","1956200"," can get paid on spreads into friday but the but the chance of you like came to buy some friday"
"1956200","1962060"," calls and they're gonna or i i'm stuck in friday calls we're gonna make this giant move up and"
"1962060","1966280"," they're gonna print three four hundred percent probably done they're probably going to what they're"
"1966280","1972320"," probably going to do is kill options they'll kill puts they'll kill calls into friday they'll"
"1972320","1981020"," they'll print the number but they won't print the options uh that's my that's my that's my into"
"1981020","1988900"," thursday and friday unlike most previous years heading into the fourth of july weekend where you"
"1988900","1994920"," normally get a nice run up into friday you pack your shit on friday you go on vacation everybody's"
"1994920","2002600"," having bears blood wisers whatever the fuck is american's drink and uh on on on fourth july and"
"2002600","2008360"," they drink tequila shots and i don't know blows some i shouldn't talk like that but end of you know"
"2008360","2013000"," but end of friday usually that's when this is taking place it doesn't look like that's going to"
"2013000","2018500"," happen it also looks like if it does happen it's going to happen while we're shooting comments from"
"2018500","2023760"," heading into friday i could be wrong in this i've got some call if you guys want to know i'm"
"2023760","2030160"," holding calls so i'm holding calls friday wednesday thursday friday right here because you never"
"2030160","2037280"," know right uh can we trade lower from here into friday uh i think that though i think that i"
"2037280","2043120"," would expect volatility in moves not volatility in the vix but i would expect you know same thing"
"2043120","2049320"," you're gonna get some consolidation rip higher consolidation rip higher something like that uh it"
"2049320","2057100"," will pull on here into for into friday that's my expectation in into thursday and friday you got"
"2057100","2061040"," you guys ever see these moves where we make creepy crawly moves up at the end of the day uh"
"2061040","2067360"," it's gonna be something like that or uh it could be lower we've got we've also got uh we also"
"2067360","2074300"," still out there have the jpm collar which i think that's down at 362 or something i can be wrong"
"2074300","2081440"," in that uh they could be long those puts so they might pin us into thursday friday into the 362"
"2081440","2086699"," area you still have that that potential out there heading into end of month there was also some"
"2086699","2093800"," discussion that into end of month that jpm might attempt to hide uh their new collar for the next"
"2093800","2099400"," quarter uh just seeing from yes this could be one of the best works to uh is to be done"
"2099400","2104380"," yet on a deal to free Ukrainian grain could be wrong in this but i think last september they tried"
"2104380","2112960"," to hide either last september or last uh june july they tried to hide uh their collar they did they"
"2112960","2119140"," changed like the time on their collar trade i think maybe they split it up or something in the"
"2119140","2122940"," morning or the night time it had to think about that but we'll tell we can talk about that later"
"2122940","2131400"," this afternoon as well but i'm going to expect some demand destruction uh into end of day today i'm"
"2131400","2136640"," going to expect or not demand destruction expect uh option destruction and of today i'm going to"
"2136640","2143740"," expect uh option destruction into thursday uh in that they'll print uh they'll they'll print out"
"2143740","2151340"," their uh their spreads into into thursday and friday and then of course uh due to the rebalancing"
"2151340","2158220"," that's going to continue into the thirtieth you should see some wild moves uh on the indexes but"
"2158220","2163860"," individual tickers as well as big trades come into the market and we'll pay attention to those uh"
"2163860","2173080"," as we look forward here if you guys are looking for an index too long uh if you were looking"
"2173080","2182580"," for an index too long you're like hey i want to trade earnings season or at least the run up"
"2182580","2190480"," interning season i always wonder why bother with individual tickers when you can if you were to"
"2190480","2196260"," trade i'm number one if you were to if you were to trade uh just excel xlk for a lead"
"2196260","2203720"," up into the 15th would be would be an easy way for you to trade uh the average of tech"
"2203720","2211140"," into earning season to take maybe a spread on xlk would be something that i would be interested in"
"2211140","2217540"," take a spread taking in the money spread on xlk expiring maybe the third week second to third week"
"2217540","2225880"," of of uh of july i think that's a it's a fairly decent trade i also like the idea of"
"2225880","2231720"," i still like the idea oh i like the idea of excel v as well health care had a great"
"2231720","2237020"," bid come into it i think that figuring out money was talking about that that they actually got a"
"2237020","2243780"," real bid last week so xlv i also like and seasonally it's another good uh another good place to"
"2243780","2252300"," place some money for the month of july i also i'm interested in keeping an eye on materials xlb"
"2252300","2259860"," uh they're still selling off today but i do like where i do like the accumulation that's come into"
"2259860","2268220"," xlk believe it or not the safest trade out there right now is going to be xlv we already knew"
"2268220","2272340"," that we knew that we knew that sunde stable credit conditions weak in a mid high inflation rising"
"2272340","2280500"," rates and slower growth now even though even though we've got uh xlv being weak today i've met my"
"2280500","2285280"," effect had some calls that i sold yesterday into the close i should have held them into the open"
"2285280","2291220"," today but it was plenty for me uh and i think this is a top for xlv it's seasonally it's"

"2314100","2320160"," necessarily good for the market either uh deflation can actually continue or lead to uh recession"
"2320160","2327420"," so uh so xlv i think has hit a top to a point or oil is hit a top to"
"2327420","2335020"," a point but oil and gas specifically still worthy of buying dips on so every time you see xlv sell"
"2335020","2342880"," off i'd be looking to buy dips in xlv over the general stock market still still still still want to"
"2342880","2349380"," trade xlv uh it's matter of fact it's down to 73 91 currently uh so and we had about we"

"2454330","2458490"," gonna bring this over right now we have some we're showing some weakness in the market right now"
"2458490","2464210"," looking for a tag below a little bit of lattering down below to this 377 talked about this 377 down"
"2464210","2469930"," below here a little bit of weakness the market still buyers coming in consolidation day not taking"
"2469930","2475130"," this as i'm not going to take this right now as we're back to selling the market once again either"
"2475130","2481850"," this is just going to be an accumulation day for the market and not that we're going anywhere now"
"2481850","2487530"," what we're going to look at here is this is the WMA this is a 200 a moving average i"
"2487530","2492110"," want to what you guys to see this in previous years i want you to see that when we have"
"2492110","2498290"," steep sell-offs in this market we like to test it we like testing it in 2020 in march 2020"
"2498290","2503910"," and we act this is actually when uh the fed stepped in right week he was talking about the fed"
"2503910","2509970"," put as when we stepped in on that fed put right so you can see that when we react off"
"2509970","2516250"," that you can i want you to see here in january of uh january 14th of 2016 right we tested"
"2516250","2522330"," it we confirmed it we moved higher and we've done this is a great check to have out there if"
"2522330","2526650"," you're a long-term investor long-term trader and then i also want you to see when we break down"
"2526650","2533650"," below at what happens uh and this you could this is a ruthless one back here and uh 2008 tested"
"2533650","2539050"," it right confirmed we're going long here and they psyched us out right so you got burned in here"
"2539050","2542970"," gave you one more chance to get out yesterday we had that two where they gave us one more chance"
"2542970","2549830"," to get out and sure enough we sold this market down pretty pretty severely in 2008 i should have i"
"2549830","2555270"," should be bringing up spx not yes because it goes back farther in time it's probably not the best"
"2555270","2561450"," best uh to be using but you can see the same effect uh back in 2000 we traded but what"
"2561450","2567670"," we tried to maintain above it couldn't trade below the weekly moving average and this is my my my"
"2567670","2573410"," point to you is that as we get closer it we're attracted to the weekly moving average in a macro"
"2573410","2578770"," in a macro sense uh if you matter of fact if you look at this on if you use the"
"2578770","2584730"," weekly moving average on the composite index the new york the new york composite index you can go"
"2584730","2592400"," back to the 1970s even deeper 60s and look at the same uh interplay with the weekly moving average"
"2592400","2597580"," we're down here when we get down here like this right when we get close like this where it's like"
"2597580","2602160"," a magnet that draws us down so that's the key thing you don't have to look at too many other"
"2602160","2607320"," things out there want you to look at that and realize that that this is a magnet and it's gonna"
"2607320","2612880"," and this this average is going to trade higher and higher even if we trade sideways let's say in a"
"2612880","2617100"," july in august we're eventually going to touch it and we're going to find a reaction we're going to"
"2617100","2622000"," find out if we're going to trade below it or if we're going to bounce off it uh and take"
"2622000","2628040"," a move higher now on a on a smaller time frame i want to show you guys this sell-off"
"2628040","2634100"," right here i want you to see this sell-off okay i want you to see that sell-off right"
"2634100","2639260"," there the steepness of that sell-off and i want you to look in previous times when we've done that"
"2639260","2645340"," right what ends up happening even just right here we that we consolidated and then had had it lower"
"2645340","2650300"," after we move higher do you guys see this i want you guys to see this move higher here that"
"2650300","2656780"," we had as well see that nice that nice rip we had we had another nice rip right here right"
"2656780","2664060"," we sold it off then we continued down right i want you to see what happens when we have these"
"2664060","2670700"," rips so if we sell off here right we have this beautiful rip higher and we wound up selling off"
"2670700","2677860"," severely every time we make moves like this right it's not the last drop you can see one there and"
"2677860","2686860"," then one more confirmation down same thing over here somehow this is losing this same thing down"
"2686860","2694560"," here boom down same thing above over here going to see that move initially move up right we had a"
"2694560","2701400"," bleed out we traded up higher and then boom down and we we do this frequently and not this is"
"2701400","2708860"," this didn't happen we're in a bull market but it happens trade sideways boom down right this one"
"2708860","2714720"," wasn't too out this wasn't as ugly but this just killed premium so if you're a bull out there this"
"2714720","2720340"," is actually back to in uh September this is when it actually started but i want you to see that"
"2720340","2726660"," uh even right now for where we are in this market for today if you're going to ask me in"
"2726660","2732220"," a bear market if you're going to ask me in a bear market if you're going to ask me after"
"2732220","2741100"," this steep sell off here pay cap well that's excellent let's see here pay cap after this steep sell"
"2741100","2744980"," off are we going to rip to all-time new highs or hay cap we're going to go close that"
"2744980","2751700"," gap at 400 you know anything is possible but the reality of it is even if we're to trade up"
"2751700","2759060"," here even if we trade up here on friday let's say uh whether it's now or it doesn't matter how"
"2759060","2765040"," we get there let's say we trade up to 390 by friday we're more than likely going to then trade"
"2765040","2773040"," down into the beginning of july until we find real support and probably at 350 right which is the"
"2773040","2778240"," WMA the weekly moving average and then we trade up into the rest of july so i i have this"
"2778240","2785660"," i'm not feeling but just from previous experience uh in this year that i don't know why i want to"
"2785660","2793940"," say a previous uh or a feeling but just this just this previous year looking into the month of july"
"2795520","2800640"," my thought process is going to be that we're going to hit that that weekly moving average that"
"2800640","2806320"," weekly moving average is down here at 350 when we'll follow my cursor down here so if you end up"
"2806320","2811000"," let's say you end up let's say let's clear this out let's say in a trade let's say let's just"
"2811000","2816560"," say we trade it up to 390 for friday right we'll clear this out let's just say we consolidate here"
"2816560","2824660"," trade up here for 390 this is like this is the bull case right we still have the entire month"
"2824660","2832340"," of july so you could just we could just do consolidation right for earning season and then that"
"2832340","2838800"," slowed that slow drop off but ten times out of ten this year we've had a sell-off like this"
"2838800","2845020"," experience something like this during this time pair you'll see you'll see let's say you'll see"
"2845020","2853580"," like health care blast off as an example right but not the s&p 500 you'll see individual components"
"2853580","2859880"," for sectors of the s&p 500 do well but you won't see the s&p 500 do well and"
"2859880","2866250"," you'll eventually see the s&p 500 actually roll over so we're we're going to see the we're going to"
"2866250","2873650"," see the weekly moving average this week into friday i don't know so we're going to see it into july"
"2873650","2879390"," more than likely by the end of july we'll see a meetup because it keeps trading it keeps averaging"
"2879390","2886210"," higher as well more than likely we'll see that meetup with it probably at the end of earning season"
"2886210","2891730"," you'll end up seeing that so do i think we're going all-time highs no from here no do i"
"2891730","2898310"," think that we're gonna gonna blast off it here in friday and then trade even higher it's july i"
"2898310","2904910"," don't see it i see individual thinkers doing it i see an individual sector doing it but not the s "
"2904910","2910510","&p 500 and i don't see it in the cues either i just i'm not seeing it uh it does"
"2910510","2915250"," matter of fact if you're going to trade if you're going to trade tech i don't know that i would"
"2915250","2925220"," trade cues i would trade probably xlk and not uh not the um let me put"
"2925220","2938730"," this away here not the cues uh personally i wouldn't be trading it uh what"
"2938730","2945050"," are you guys asking here is there any way to measure how far from the moving average we got in"
"2945050","2950190"," covid before the fed did it yeah i think i measured it once before i think it was another 15"
"2950190","2956290"," i think it was 10 or 15 percent somewhere in there uh but it was so fast if if you"
"2956290","2965270"," guys remember trading it it was from a from what i recall of trading it it moved so fast right"
"2965270","2973530"," it was it was it was it was it was so fucking fast and then when the fed had the"
"2973530","2978310"," when the fed had the emergency it was weird when i remember that they had them they like the fed"
"2978310","2984850"," came out and gave like a speech and then i think they went to the senate if i recall and"
"2984850","2990790"," then that's when the fed put was was it put in place so there was like this like three day"
"2990790","2994970"," area or three i think it was three to five days of caring call but i think it was like"
"2994970","3000910"," three days uh where the market just kept fucking bleeding and there was another fucked up part or"
"3000910","3009990"," there's another crazy part about that because when we finally fact"
"3009990","3017870"," and no i have to admit this for the first time i was like uh i think i wm is"
"3017870","3023150"," going to keep crashing or flat and the s&p 500 and attacking all the stay at home shit's going"
"3023150","3028510"," to go up there's no way to get that the iWM the small caps are going to go up and"
"3028510","3034210"," if i had taken that trade i would have been a billionaire because that was actually the trade to"
"3034210","3049110"," take for all those zombie companies i guess"
"3049110","3053070"," be that my gut is there any way to measure how far i guess to be that they have a"
"3053070","3060980"," stare deviation trigger or something historically there is a percent chance that we trade down into"
"3060980","3069780"," july yeah the trading down the trading down into july this is a shocker uh we haven't had a july"
"3069780","3077460"," like this in some time like an ugly ass into july trade i'm not i wasn't expecting this myself uh"
"3077460","3083360"," that we were i thought we'd trade heavy it would trade well into fourth july weekend uh no it's"
"3083360","3092100"," more of a morale booster for uh people with foreign case pensions stuff like that uh that it will"
"3092100","3098040"," trade up that that's my personal belief that it's it's a way for the news uh cycle to be remain"
"3098040","3103000"," calm whatsoever you'll hear people say uh you know you're gonna hear this here is you're gonna you"
"3103000","3107760"," always hear this uh it's all bullshit you'll be like i'm an industry professional they told me to"
"3107760","3111920"," have my laptop next to me in case the market crashes over the weekend you'll hear shit like that"
"3111920","3120800"," this weekend uh so yeah the so you'll you'll end up seeing uh and i'm not saying we don't we"

"3146500","3154400"," uh it fucking deleted it so i said fucking i'm too lazy to post this but even on monday i"
"3154400","3160680"," meant i wanted to make a post on monday because i had bought some some calls at the close on"
"3160680","3170560"," monday and first i looked at i looked at uh wednesday 400 c's and i looked i was watching"
"3170560","3180040"," tracking uh 400 c's for wednesday and 400 c's for friday and the market makers and dealers already"
"3180040","3186820"," knew they were selling this market on uh tuesday they already knew uh but i was really spooked on"
"3186820","3196960"," the deltas and the pricing of the deltas for wednesday and for friday and uh so i"
"3196960","3204080"," remember i remembered the price action on the wednesday 400 c's and when we traded up to three"
"3204080","3213780"," three nine or three three three on tuesday at the open i had my my 400 c's for"
"3213780","3222480"," friday were up like 80 percent so i closed those out and i looked at the wednesday 400 c's and"
"3222480","3231040"," they were up maybe 10 or 20 percent real low and normally you would have seen if if we were"
"3231040","3235840"," going to head up into wednesday in a 400 if that was a true rip you would have seen uh"
"3235840","3241920"," the implied move premium kick in to those calls and they were having none of it so they knew they"
"3241920","3246960"," knew they knew were actually reversing yesterday they were reversing past third three three eighty"
"3246960","3254900"," fifty or deeper uh than three eighty fifty so uh just be just be conscious of that they knew that"
"3254900","3262680"," the market was going to uh trade up into 400 or test 400 into wednesday or friday uh they had"
"3262680","3269220"," a little bit of a chance that we're trading up to 400 on monday tuesday but as of today there's"
"3269220","3275720"," just no fucking way it ain't happening uh so they're gonna burn those calls down uh even if we even"
"3275720","3281060"," we do trade up there they're not gonna pay them so there's no no payments on those calls uh the"
"3281060","3285300"," implied move at most is probably three ninety so just for monday and ten minutes time we are"

"3349620","3356520"," i want to talk to you guys about tesla so tesla uh i want to show you guys where support"

"3373160","3377440"," real quick i'm going to show you guys where real support is in tesla i post all right well i"
"3377440","3383060"," think i live streamed this a week or two ago uh we talked i talked about this it's not here"

"3392660","3401040"," make this small it's right here so believe it or not this 600 right here right is right where the"
"3401040","3407860"," the weekly moving average was uh a couple weeks ago uh so 600 that i made a post on twitter"
"3407860","3414760"," we actually bounced off 620 right here watch my cursor right here we bounced up between 620 and 630"
"3414760","3423720"," and i posted on twitter and said uh bulls don't give this up here and this this area right here"
"3423720","3431180"," is where you should begin to see buyers step in and this area right here at 600 should be where"
"3431180","3434500"," russian foreign minister russia is ready to help reduce the"
"3434500","3443800"," threat of a we bounce off of the"
"3443800","3452780"," weekly moving average now you want to see a reaction here if you don't see a reaction on 600 uh"
"3452780","3458340"," and that would mean that the entire market is probably going to go into some sort of a limit down"
"3458340","3467100"," or some sort of a reaction where we trade much much lower much lower and specifically there isn't"
"3467100","3474440"," much holding uh it's it's not like a uh it's there's not a lot there it's like 550 500 and"
"3474440","3480220"," actually goes down into the 300s believe it or not i think the next move down is uh the next"
"3480220","3488980"," target's like 360 or something uh it's very nasty and you would expect the same of the spy so if"
"3488980","3498540"," if we do trade below the weekly moving average if we do trade below the the stream is sponsored by"
"3498540","3504960"," tick strike tick strike allows you to actually hear water flowing futures forex and stock so if we"
"3504960","3512300"," do end up trading below that 600 mark on tesla you're going to see the market trade violently lower"
"3512300","3519720"," as well so keep like keep both of those in your minds think about the entire market and why would"
"3519720","3527520"," tesla trade severely down if we trade below the weekly moving average we reject and begin a move"
"3527520","3535540"," lower that's when you start to see credit default risks that's when you see large banks go under"
"3535540","3540720"," you could that's when you could see maybe a someone coming out and saying yeah we bought a shit out"
"3540720","3547880"," of bitcoin and we fucking blew up this bank so when people say well you you'll never see tesla go"
"3547880","3556340"," that low trust me if you get a base large bank default like you know like a like a like"
"3556340","3562660"," a leaving right or you see like a bank of america default you see a jpm believe it or not"
"3562660","3569300"," default and we know they're too big to fail but basically you'll have a default of some kind that"
"3569300","3576000"," would make us move lower so that's 600 is where you want to paying attention to six twenty six"
"3576000","3581600"," hundred and be paying attention to the we're getting a nice bounce down arrows down here still some"
"3581600","3586620"," nice buyers this you can see down on the bottom right hand side of my screen got more buyers than"

"3730990","3738390"," from yesterday uh so i'm going to assume i'm going to assume that the market maker is going to burn"
"3738390","3745170"," the fuck out of those puts heading into the closed day it's just a matter of when they're going to"
"3745170","3749250"," burn them just not now so i'm going to give it just a little bit longer here probably head into"
"3749250","3754770"," the two or three o'clock hour and then look for some calls at that point that's a good question"
"3756890","3763490"," uh winky saying that's september monthly spy 450 c's the grand total of 56 cents yeah that's not a"
"3763490","3769510"," good sign i mean normally you don't get a good kick uh so uh so winky's making a good point"

"3778930","3786670"," two years three years out in the money they can print they can use a bunch of different shit you"
"3786670","3791750"," can do with them uh you can do poor main cover calls on them to make money but as we"
"3791750","3797090"," get closer like one to three months out if they're out of the money they tend not to print a"
"3797090","3805030"," ton unless we make significant moves up over that time period uh select when i buy spy calls that"
"3805030","3809810"," are like a week three week through a week two weeks a month a month and a half out two"
"3809810","3817270"," months out they don't really start printing heavy until we make those moves uh hundred point moves"
"3817270","3822950"," higher each time i'll start to see them actually kick in and start printing heavy but yeah you can"
"3822950","3830150"," see that right september but still uh september 450 c being a grand total of 56 cents is not a"
"3830150","3839770"," good sign at all so it's not a good sign uh there there are uh yeah so i showed"

"3944290","3952610"," 50c i don't think so i'm getting more but i'm getting more um bearish getting more and more bearish"
"3952610","3962170"," on this market winky uh no uh so last year i believe it was closed the first time"
"3963090","3974110"," i believe it became a federal holiday in may i think we were closed last uh june team that's a"
"3974110","3983880"," question though yeah so i man i i was i was getting uh"
"3985880","3994100"," i was getting somewhat bullish if if i was hope so my hope was that we my hope was this"
"3994760","4002380"," my hope was that we traded down to the fucking weekly moving average we need you we're not going to"
"4002380","4009420"," get a fed pivot here we're not getting one here and so you're not going to get a fed pivot"
"4009420","4016840"," here you for the market to get gain traction or steam i agree with uh i still agree with the"
"4016840","4026260"," bank saying that we should close the the uh year out uh at 500 or near 500 or even 460"
"4026260","4033920"," or 450 i'm not anti that statement but for us to get there something needs to happen it could be"
"4033920","4043520"," ukraine that sends us there so there needs to be a headline news for a"
"4043520","4049660"," fundamental reason for us to trade there the only things that i'm seeing are weekly moving averages"
"4049660","4059660"," something important like that uh a fed put right uh i don't i'm trying you know"
"4059660","4065380"," ukraine it's got to be something like that for the market to trade up that high to close that high"
"4065380","4069660"," i think you can even do it but like if we hit the if we hit the move weekly moving"
"4069660","4077320"," average in july we bounced yeah i could see 450 in september uh i think that's very doable but"
"4077320","4083040"," without that without that confirmation first like you can't buy them at 56 cents you got to wait"
"4083040","4089640"," until we go down there um or i would buy them the moment that ukraine news broke if you if"
"4089640","4097100"," you we should talk about that if if if the ukraine had a truce uh you would be all in"
"4097100","4106420"," on far dated calls outside the money for dirt cheap uh 20 cents 10 cents 50 cents also buy some"
"4106420","4112740"," farther dated stuff some leaps and stuff because you'll get at least a 300 point move out of that"
"4112740","4120140"," uh it could be even higher than 300 points off that initial reaction yeah it's not that i'm it's"
"4120140","4124700"," not that i don't think you can trade there i just i think you need a reason to trade there"
"4124700","4130020"," i don't think earning seasons enough to trade there i don't think that i think it's you need a"
"4130020","4139620"," reason you have to have a material it's very much like like uh covid the market"
"4139620","4148560"," just fucking sold off and didn't stop until someone stepped in and said hey uh here's a reason for"
"4148560","4156120"," you to buy this market you have to have that reason to buy this market we're six months in you"
"4156120","4166960"," need some kind of a reason uh for this market to turn around uh taiwan i'm"
"4166960","4171479"," so i'm ex army if any of you guys know out there they are training up uh more u.s."
"4171880","4180220"," soldiers than normal right now uh to fight china i know for sure that the u.s. is preparing to"
"4180220","4187500"," defend uh taiwan hundred percent do i think that we fight taiwan uh or excuse me do i think we"
"4187500","4196700"," fight china no i was stationed in uh south korea uh for a year and"
"4196700","4204680"," i wasn't uh from what i was able to see i was able to sit into meetings i was able"
"4204680","4214160"," to sit in meetings that i can't talk about of course but from my take on my experience uh it"
"4214160","4220600"," would be absurd for china to even the outside of the news that you hear the broadcast out there the"
"4220600","4228220"," pundits that talk the real behind-the-scenes players that the know about war plan war fight wars"
"4228220","4237860"," war fighters uh and then just as an american citizen the the vastness of our military"
"4237860","4245440"," i don't think that people can grasp sometimes the power and reach of the u.s. military and in asia"
"4245440","4254300"," southeast asia asia uh south asia all of it we we control the seas we control the air and then"
"4254300","4261500"," uh it was really weird when i was when i was stationed in korea the biggest fear that u.s."
"4261640","4267980"," army command had believe it or not was just north korea opening the border that was this that was"
"4267980","4274720"," the simplest thing i get a little bit of bid here in the spy right now nice little push higher"
"4274720","4282120"," here in the spy i'm gonna go back and check on some calls here we got some three eighty three"
"4282120","4289400"," three's or fifty nine cents heading into sixty cents territory right now i want to see if we can"
"4289400","4296000"," get those it's like the three eighty eighths are five cents right now five cents the three eighty"
"4296000","4300640"," eight look at that look at that target up there man if we can run up to three eighty eight"
"4300640","4306080"," today watch my cursor right here if we can run up to here by close today there will be five"
"4306080","4313940"," fucking cents dirt cheap uh well i'm going to i'm going to keep my eyes on those three eighths uh"
"4313940","4326300"," so my point going back to china is we're of course going to prepare to fight that war but"
"4326300","4333060"," to think that we're going to to think that we're going to oh i got to think i'll look at"
"4333060","4340100"," this i might buy some calls here i get a little bit closer here get nichey here i would try"
"4340100","4347080"," i haven't i haven't added anything on at this point this is all day traders i don't see taiwan man"
"4347080","4355960"," being a being a war we fight i honestly don't i i china man like north or south korean soldiers"
"4355960","4365200"," are badasses too i'm trying to think of of chinese soldiers have limited experience and more their"
"4365200","4374720"," experience that they've had in africa like dereliction of duty desertion like real bad stuff real"
"4374720","4382000"," bad stuff like they're not uh they don't they don't really have that warrior tradition it's hard to"
"4382000","4394010"," suck to say that doesn't"
"4394010","4400850"," 20 years of afghanistan at work put uh question marks over the might of us military uh no so i"
"4400850","4407990"," want to be clear on this uh we killed everybody in iraq and afghanistan people forget that we went"
"4407990","4417590"," uh people forget that we went to we didn't go afghanistan to to win hearts and minds that became"
"4417590","4425890"," uh that was something down the road so i was a soldier then um we went to afghanistan to kill"
"4425890","4430630"," people that's the only reason we went to afghanistan that's what we did uh we did the same thing in"
"4430630","4437690"," iraq too we killed millions of people uh we're very good as war fighters we never went to iraq or"
"4437690","4444670"," to afghanistan uh to win hearts and minds in my view uh that that wasn't our intent now what your"
"4444670","4452450"," can what your fed to consume as a civilian and to keep the war effort going is different we went"
"4452450","4459230"," to iraq for oil it's an acronym it's for oil uh it's for isra o i l right as an"
"4459230","4468950"," acronym so oil over oil i for israel and alpha logistics for a footprint in the middle east uh"
"4468950","4473330"," and that's why we were there that's what i was told that's what i was that's what we knew why"
"4473330","4479810"," we were there that's what uh contractors were told that's what contractors were doing uh in africa"
"4479810","4486050"," west africa and in the middle east uh in afghanistan had had more to do with just killing people to"
"4486050","4491290"," leave right there's some pipeline stuff as well in afghanistan but mostly and that was for private"
"4491290","4499430"," companies uh in afghanistan in my view we succeeded uh in what we were trying to do and furthermore"
"4499430","4506790"," politically and geopolitically by having a hot spot going on at that time uh it keeps people's"
"4506790","4512490"," attention always having a bad guy is a good thing to have believe it or not geopolitically now this"
"4512490","4517630"," isn't my politics or anything but you guys are asking so i'll tell you guys uh so right now we've"
"4517630","4522870"," got a bad guy it's russia and china do i think that that comes into a fighting war i doubt"
"4522870","4529730"," it uh and dude the capabilities of the uh capabilities of the united states military where you guys"
"4529730","4536170"," are fed and what you got what really happens it's so different it's hard to explain it's it's hard"
"4536170","4545750"," for as a as a prior as a the difference in what"
"4545750","4554450"," uh what am i doing here it's it's hard to um"
"4554450","4564410"," to explain to you guys what like i've told uh joe doe at the story once where i was like"

"4577510","4584810"," like u.s news and what they would report as going on in a war zone and then the reality"
"4584810","4593390"," of what was going on in the war zone was the almost opposite uh at that time so i you"
"4593390","4601670"," need to as a civilian take into account uh what the propaganda is what the new even your news your"
"4601670","4608150"," doesn't matter if it's fox whoever's cnn uh that the reality of what's going on is absolutely"
"4608150","4615870"," nothing what you thought it was and why in the background why those things happen uh it's just not"
"4615870","4621570"," it never has been and never will be um so it's hard for me sometimes when people bring up like"
"4621570","4628390"," what should we do in af or afghanistan or we lost afghanistan i did i didn't perceive us as losing"
"4628390","4634090"," afghanistan that was a win whether no that doesn't mean that i'm like an agreement for what we did"
"4634090","4639850"," in afghanistan but uh you have to look after the perspective of what we're trying to do um and what"
"4639850","4644730"," they tell you publicly is different than what they were trying to do behind the scenes it was a"
"4644730","4655900"," more of a geopolitical move uh a"

"6647970","6656710"," a nice trade down here 74 372 would be the target there is some support down here at 378 and"

"6662550","6668130"," like so we got some support down here currently we can cut right through the butter so you'd see"
"6668130","6677050"," something like a rejection trade below rejection boom right so your puts get back in your puts and"
"6677050","6681770"," then you get that move down on the clothes if we can get that this trade lines up and then"

"7014460","7024420"," into almost almost the end right but 520 this would correlate to in august right uh"
"7024420","7030860"," like august 20th believe it or not trading down into august 20th see this little quick move up"
"7030860","7039920"," higher after the 15th right so let's just move down here first the month is the 30th trade down"
"7039920","7045040"," into july and then slightly up and then we just we just start trading it down this is what i"
"7045040","7049900"," meant by walk the plank this morning when i was talking about walking the plank so if we do this"
"7049900","7057060"," kind of a regime or setup uh into this new quarter and quarterly earnings season you get pretty"
"7057060","7063360"," nasty when you're talking about some real nasty stuff here right if we have controlled demand"
"7063360","7071420"," destruction and let's say let's say we even trade this up just for the moment but then we start to"
"7071420","7078960"," trade it down into august are you prepared for that seems like it makes sense to me until we have"
"7078960","7086960"," some fundamental material news in the market uh to have something like this happen into august at"
"7086960","7092220"," least on the index level uh shows me that they're going to make you walk the plank into and there's"
"7092220","7098680"," 320 down there right that ultimate goal of 320 um i prefer to see a capitulation and move higher"
"7098680","7106140"," before that headline news right you crane uh weekly moving average uh fed put any of those kind of"
"7106140","7111760"," things to make us go up and higher but until you get that uh the regime is going to be"
"7111760","7118700"," uh walk the plank so if you wanted to trade individual tickers i could say yeah you could do that"
"7118700","7124360"," uh if you're going if you're going to be like hey i think tech can do well sure do i"

"7390180","7396360"," want to see this trade down here you can see right now currently that's where we are i'd like to"
"7396360","7402340"," see us trade down to 372 if possible maybe looking for a bounce as well and then uh to pick"
"7402340","7407800"," that trade up with this we can get a good bounce i'll get the trade again i'll jump on that"
"7407800","7424720"," trade right here now"

"7435940","7446570"," s s how you doing uh we"
"7446570","7456210"," already sold short above at 379 379 58 we already talked about the rejection we already talked"
"7456210","7460710"," about the break below the rejection we got the rejection now trading lower price target down below"
"7460710","7473170"," is 370 377 61 first price target and you"
"7473170","7481410"," should see a bounce close puts reposition for the next like lower there's some laddering going on"
"7481410","7487650"," hopefully you can grind right through this 376 price target down below would be 374 to 372"
"7491910","7501650"," watching some resistance build now as well above hopefully i can get in here like 379 64 if i can"
"7501650","7512470"," get in there we'll lower this down a little bit 179 64 right here i'll be looking for 379"
"7512470","7555460"," 64 if i can grab some puts up there i will I'm"

"7589620","7593380"," want to see if i can grab i'm going to try to grab some puts here in just a minute"
"7597200","7606980"," i'm going to see how good the house strong this this bar is right here it's"
"7606980","7616960"," definitely not slicing through like butter right you can see the rejection here so"
"7616960","7628350"," that's nice do like butter it's a coffee let's"
"7628350","7634710"," see if i can make grab some puts up here firm rejection there currently nice little bounce"
"7642110","7671490"," you"
"7684310","7701470"," I can buy some some putts I"
"7701470","7703010"," think the lower gap gets filled."
"7705590","7712810"," So the moment we traded below, so before we even traded below here, we can see you guys have paid"
"7712810","7713170"," attention."
"7715670","7720950"," When we were trading down here, we were looking for a break below, we got it, we got a rejection"
"7721530","7724010"," trade down to this first level of support. "
"7724130","7725610"," It's a pretty big level of support right here."
"7726470","7728030"," I like to come back up, right?"
"7728270","7735810"," Reject above and break through either to this 375 mark, but realistically lower."
"7737550","7744730"," So if I'm going to look at 5-day chart here, this is the support going back to the 23rd. "
"7745450","7753530"," We know that this is the negative trend going lower down here, so it's still, and it's not that"
"7753530","7755110"," far, it has to be down here at 375."
"7758430","7765170"," So I'd like to see this trade down here, even as a bold, I'd like to buy this, if we're"
"7765170","7772870"," not going to get up to 390 or 400, I wouldn't mind buying this, the 383 or 338 up here."
"7773050","7774710"," This was here earlier, but it's disappeared now. "
"7775190","7775970"," It's gone, baby."
"7777630","7779950"," So we are trading down right now."
"7785470","7791970"," That supply has now come down right now. "
"7791970","7793750"," 380, 27."
"7799790","7803270"," 380, 27, right there."
"7807250","7812010"," That's this line right here, Vwap, just put Vwap on there. "
"7816970","7819350"," Vwap, let's get Vwap real quick."
"7824570","7833670"," I'm going to pop up, I'm not going to put"
"7833670","7834670"," on..."
"7852250","7854410"," You can see that Vwap come right up here too."
"7868030","7876130"," Vwap,"
"7876130","7884290"," Vwap, Vwap, Vwap, Vwap. "
"7892430","7893790"," Clear skies above."
"7909950","7911930"," Can you guys hear me out there?"
"7911930","7912970"," I was just taking a break."
"7914270","7915510"," Can you guys hear me?"
"7918010","7918950"," Let's take a quick break. "
"7919810","7920510"," I missed that."
"7923950","7927930"," I missed that, those puts earlier, so I'm trying to catch trade this time."
"7931450","7933510"," Remember a live stream for you guys?"
"7933750","7940890"," I can't have a hard time trading for like the five, ten minute plays. "
"7940890","7942230"," I have a hard time trading them."
"7963030","7965310"," This is the first part of the trade right here."
"7969630","7971450"," Let me look for a rejection. "
"7972670","7974210"," This is the big move right here."
"7975210","7976190"," We'll see if we can get this."
"7976790","7978930"," If you bought calls in here, this is good money too. "
"7980470","7983770"," We're going to trade right back to Vwap and look for a rejection for a move lower."
"8006950","8008790"," Let's do C2."
"8011070","8012210"," 381. "
"8020250","8022110"," Full fight and stay alive here."
"8023650","8024830"," Hey Deanna, how are you?"
"8025990","8026870"," Hope you're doing well."
"8028030","8028750"," Doing great. "
"8029450","8029770"," Staying healthy."
"8030790","8030830"," Working."
"8031190","8031870"," Joe, good to see you. "
"8034050","8035750"," Y'all call them out as they happen."
"8040890","8042750"," Any faith in going along in Vwap reclaim?"
"8043350","8048130"," No, you'd want to hear where we are right now."
"8049250","8050110"," You can trade. "
"8051250","8054070"," I mean, so there's a trade, there was a, hold on."
"8054550","8054990"," That's a good question."
"8055290","8055890"," So there's a trade. "
"8056370","8057130"," So there's a trade."
"8064230","8065870"," So there's like five minute trades, right?"
"8066110","8069510"," There's a trade here on rejection, right?"
"8070930","8072910"," There's another trade here."
"8075010","8076190"," Five minute trade, right?"
"8077530","8082970"," And then even, but even in here, what you're looking for is what you're looking for for a longer"
"8082970","8085310"," trade is positioning. "
"8087290","8093090"," So you want to, as a bear, you want to see, you know, that first bounce and then a rejection."
"8093930","8095510"," Once that's confirmed, right?"
"8095830","8097770"," Anywhere in here, it's going to be a big move down."
"8098770","8100250"," You'll end up breaking through here. "
"8101330","8103130"," If you're bullish here, right?"
"8103850","8107330"," You're like, well, can I, can I stay in this trade to Vwap?"
"8107650","8114570"," No, but you can, what you can do is trade it to Vwap and then wait for it to consolidate"
"8114570","8117070"," and then up again, right?"
"8117330","8119110"," And you pick the trade back up in here somewhere."
"8119790","8126590"," Knowing a cotton here in the trade right now, but a more macro level is bearish."
"8131550","8134050"," So this trade right now is bearish. "
"8135590","8137050"," Can I turn to a bull place?"
"8137270","8137350"," Sure."
"8138490","8139970"," But we have a bear flag here."
"8140670","8142370"," Get a previous low way back over there. "
"8142490","8143710"," We've got some laddering going on."
"8144270","8146510"," Something adds up to bearish."
"8147990","8151350"," See, I want to, I'm checking on book map right now. "
"8151430","8153290"," You can see that supports weakening."
"8155970","8157690"," It's not as weak, but it's weakening."
"8168070","8173850"," And then I'm watching calls and puts coming into the market right now. "
"8175690","8177150"," See, everybody's going to bite on this."
"8177830","8179770"," So I'm not seeing anybody bite yet on this."
"8180010","8189610"," So I want to see somebody bite on this and then I'll grab those puts are now $1.47. And"
"8189610","8191610"," so you're looking for this rejection here. "
"8191809","8193910"," So we're starting to see it now."
"8196530","8199889"," And what I want to see is this will start to come down."
"8199990","8201209"," If we start coming down here. "
"8201910","8204290"," We'll start to trade trail off like this."
"8205049","8206590"," I'm going to be looking to take that short."
"8214129","8215809"," We got my finger in the trigger right now. "
"8225730","8226610"," Thank you."
"8226709","8227809"," Let's go to the collapse mode."
"8236559","8238860"," Yeah, you know, so it was weird. "
"8238879","8240459"," My wife was yelling at me."
"8241799","8244059"," First spending so much time live streaming."
"8245680","8248520"," And I haven't been live streaming and she yelled at me. "
"8249160","8251080"," Because I was like, Oh, I'll do live stream on Monday."
"8251500","8252299"," And I'm like, I'll do one on Tuesday."
"8253280","8255840"," And I'd say she was like, are you going to live stream?"
"8255959","8256580"," And I'm like, yes. "
"8258000","8259280"," But I had other shit going on."
"8259400","8259620"," I'm done."
"8260420","8261299"," Engineering stuff. "
"8261559","8266120"," And then I'm I'm a trade or I'm renovating a house."
"8267680","8271100"," It started out where like I was doing I was doing some expensive stuff."
"8271719","8274980"," And I didn't want to pay because inflation, of course. "
"8275600","8277059"," It's just like it's weird."
"8277660","8280540"," Oh, yeah, this is looking good."
"8283400","8284280"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"8291920","8292540"," So."
"8294900","8296820"," Some of the stuff I can't afford this."
"8296920","8297160"," That's weird. "
"8297299","8299799"," I priced this house out last year."
"8300740","8301360"," And."
"8302139","8304219"," The renovation was like 50 grand. "
"8305559","8306180"," Total."
"8306219","8308280"," That's with a PM, everything."
"8308780","8310080"," Like project manager. "
"8311459","8312600"," Everything legit."
"8313180","8314059"," Everything was good."
"8314320","8315080"," Right now I'm at about. "
"8316020","8318299"," $90,000, which is unacceptable."
"8321160","8322580"," Yeah, it's acceptable for the neighborhood."
"8326299","8331100"," So instead of what I paid for the house and then the construction costs, regardless if I flip it,"
"8331100","8333540"," keep it rented Airbnb, it doesn't matter. "
"8334840","8337139"," So I have to assume some of these things, right?"
"8337480","8337680"," Do myself."
"8338719","8339799"," Which is what I used to do."
"8340459","8342459"," I used to buy cheap house and I would renovate it myself. "
"8343240","8348120"," And the key key behind that is that if you do a renovation or two or three or four and"
"8348120","8349020"," you do them properly."
"8350320","8355100"," So like hire someone to help you with it or people that can help you along the way to teach"
"8355100","8355860"," you how to do this properly."
"8357820","8359219"," So you don't do a hack job. "
"8359740","8364240"," A lot of owners fuck up shit and a lot of rehabbers are scum."
"8365020","8366520"," It's all about just quick profits."
"8367660","8369559"," And that's not how I do things. "
"8370379","8373340"," So I want to make sure that like it's my home."
"8374040","8375240"," I would want to live there."
"8375520","8377379"," That everything is right and done right. "
"8379540","8382820"," Anyways, so I can't afford to do that right now."
"8382980","8386120"," So because I can't afford to do that right now because I won't make any money on the end of"
"8386120","8386459"," the deal."
"8387139","8388080"," On the backside of the deal. "
"8389240","8393040"," I can either do a rehab that's fake, right?"
"8393680","8396540"," Or I can assume some of those costs myself."
"8398120","8401640"," So right now, like I just, I think a month and a half or two months ago, I ended up"
"8401640","8402240"," having to do."
"8403420","8405020"," I ran all new electric. "
"8405680","8406860"," There's a two family house."
"8407120","8412180"," I ran all new electric to turn into one family house."
"8412780","8414940"," Connect both apartments into one house. "
"8415800","8420160"," I also did the hire guys for some of this stuff."
"8420520","8424060"," Finland and Sweden's nature accession protocol was to be signed by Tuesday."
"8425040","8427920"," But then like when I was, I also had to do some framing. "
"8427920","8432860"," They put LVLs and I had hired guys to knock the walls down."
"8433800","8436300"," Yeah, so we're not going, this is bullish, believe it or not."
"8436800","8437340"," Very bullish. "
"8439300","8440600"," I'm going to buy some calls here."
"8443280","8444180"," Come on now."
"8444820","8446280"," Get over that fucking line. "
"8446880","8449960"," Sorry, I'm swearing because I can't take a position yet."
"8450800","8453060"," Like this stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"8453640","8458000"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flowing futures, forests and stock instruments. "
"8459020","8459420"," Right."
"8460720","8463080"," So I ended up doing the LVLs, right?"
"8463200","8463920"," Hire guys to help."
"8464060","8466520"," But then I put the LVLs and I did the engineering, the drawings. "
"8467000","8468000"," I checked all the point loads."
"8468640","8471880"," All that stuff costs a lot of money to have someone else do that for you."
"8473540","8475860"," When you're like hiring guys through that stuff, it's pricey. "
"8476140","8477960"," It costs thousands and thousands of dollars."
"8478800","8479320"," Then you're invasive."
"8479640","8483340"," You're like knocking stuff down trying to find out all the point loads all the way down to the"
"8483340","8483600"," basement. "
"8483600","8486840"," And then you're going to make sure the basement, if it's not."
"8487040","8492080"," So I've got four point loads in this house in the center of it."
"8492360","8499020"," I had to knock out jackhammer out the floors of the basement and then poor footing, right?"
"8500000","8505780"," Poor footing to hold up the second and third level of the house so I can do open concept on"
"8505780","8510820"," the first, not full open concept, but it's calling a half open concept on the first floor. "
"8510820","8512840"," I don't like full full open."
"8513620","8515600"," But anyways, there's all that myself."
"8515920","8525340"," Then I'm now doing some of the demolition and I'm encountering probable lead. "
"8527280","8535940"," And if I'm not going to just fucking have people in here fucking knocking down lead with, you know,"
"8536680","8540700"," I shouldn't call it ghetto, but you know, just like guys off the street."
"8540700","8542280"," Getting sick and all that kind of stuff."
"8543120","8547160"," So I did some lead testing found with lead was did that demo myself. "
"8549680","8554280"," And then I'm hiring guys to take all the nails out of the old slats and all that kind of"
"8554280","8554480"," stuff."
"8555260","8562360"," But now I'm on to running the electricity and borrowing more electricity, not just the main or not"
"8562360","8564740"," just the boxes and the main power and all that kind of stuff."
"8565880","8570860"," But of course I want this house that like so I got my original quote for the electric was like"
"8570860","8576680"," single switches, double switches, that kind of stuff. "
"8577740","8583940"," And now I'm like, oh, I want fucking, I want these two pretty, I've got two porches in the back"
"8583940","8586020"," of this house and two porches in the front."
"8586380","8591200"," So I want to make them into like a porch for the kitchen that you can sit on."
"8591200","8596360"," Then I've got a big fucking deck and building out back for the pergola and like dining area and all"
"8596360","8598320"," other nonsense and also landscaping shit. "
"8598740","8603460"," So of course, I'm like, yeah, I want to add fucking porch lights and then floodlights and then"
"8603460","8607640"," fucking I need to come for some outlets in the kitchen."
"8607660","8611080"," And then I'm like, I want four way lights now, not two way lights, not three way lights."
"8611860","8612920"," So I'm like, shit. "
"8614000","8615880"," Like that wasn't in my estimate."
"8616280","8620340"," That guy's going to charge me $300 every add on."
"8624910","8626450"," Yeah, there's no real decision right now. "
"8627550","8628330"," I can't pick."
"8628450","8629750"," I'm not picking a side here."
"8629970","8631950"," I haven't made a trade yet. "
"8636270","8637970"," Watching some nice spy puts come in."
"8638290","8639730"," All right, I'm going to enter some puts right now."
"8645040","8645820"," Right here. "
"8645960","8646340"," Come on, baby."
"8646520","8647620"," Give me some cheap puts."
"8651360","8659600"," If you have a delay out there right now watching this stream, you can go to the cog on the"
"8659600","8663000"," bottom of YouTube player, click the cog. "
"8664580","8671580"," Increase the playback speed and that playback speed will increase the playback speed."
"8671580","8673940"," I'll sound like a clown or something."
"8674720","8681180"," Like I always do, but in a weird voice and it'll bring you into real time. "
"8684520","8690220"," Come on, print them."
"8695900","8697840"," So you'll catch up to real time with me."
"8698360","8699440"," I'm in some puts right now. "
"8699820","8703940"," I'm under $1.52. I've got $1.60 at some point here."
"8704040","8705000"," I'm going to put a stop on them."
"8705400","8713540"," I'm going to wait until we get back to this bar up here. "
"8713700","8715040"," So watch my cursor right here."
"8715980","8716660"," This cursor right here."
"8716720","8719400"," If we break above this line, I will stop out of my puts. "
"8719400","8729260"," So anyways,"
"8729600","8733560"," I'm doing all this other nonsense, this freaking house."
"8737240","8741360"," I'm sitting here doing all this work on this house that I personally doing."
"8741560","8742400"," All the easy stuff. "
"8742540","8743200"," All the easy stuff."
"8743400","8744360"," I hire all that out."
"8744840","8748220"," But there's some real expensive stuff there right now. "
"8748380","8755920"," It's just on the budget, especially with worker inflation and material."
"8755920","8757800"," Material inflation is ridiculous."
"8758960","8760760"," So I took out some studs. "
"8760760","8763560"," It's the beautiful old red pine from Kentucky."
"8764080","8765040"," This is a century home."
"8765860","8768000"," Took out old Kentucky red pine. "
"8768560","8771520"," I'm reusing it studying in this house."
"8773200","8774000"," Gorgeous studs."
"8774640","8777060"," Just because of the costs associated with everything right now. "
"8778120","8779320"," I'm actually digging through."
"8779540","8780800"," I've got a warehouse."
"8781280","8785900"," We got no warehouse. "
"8785900","8788600"," And then I've got some portable garages."
"8789980","8793780"," Another house full of shit that I've accumulated over the years."
"8794020","8797480"," I'm using incorporating some of that stuff in to reduce my costs. "
"8799580","8801620"," But I was talking to my wife on Sunday."
"8801760","8809480"," I was saying that I know there's a lot of young people out there that are forming a fucking bull"
"8809480","8810320"," flag right now."
"8813500","8814100"," All right. "
"8814380","8815600"," I'm going to have to get out of this."
"8827270","8827710"," So."
"8831530","8832410"," My wife. "
"8834030","8835310"," I was talking to my wife."
"8835450","8835690"," I'm like."
"8838320","8840000"," And I know this is real. "
"8840340","8840520"," I know."
"8841160","8844720"," So I was reading an article that said 50% of people under 35."
"8844720","8847560"," Like I think it's. "
"8849040","8854160"," Nor 50% of 30 year olds or 35 year olds, not even 18 year olds like 35 year olds."
"8854620","8856980"," Are living at home with their parents right now."
"8858040","8860340"," Come on, baby, roll it over. "
"8863970","8866690"," So that's a significant amount of our population."
"8867750","8872890"," And then I think some of that work fit or that I want more money or a better job."
"8873170","8873590"," It's real. "
"8874390","8876490"," It's fake and the cycle of our economy."
"8876990","8878350"," It's not the best time to be starting out."
"8880410","8881490"," Man, I'm stopped out. "
"8882150","8883050"," That stops me right out."
"8885810","8886430"," So the."
"8889250","8891470"," The way the economy, the way the economy is right. "
"8891790","8896090"," If you're young, starting out of this at the end of a short term debt cycle."
"8896690","8897810"," You do very well."
"8898210","8900710"," But right now we're at the price of everything right now. "
"8901070","8904750"," Price of housing price of the cost of living all of it inflation."
"8905310","8907170"," It's hard for a young person to get by."
"8907430","8913410"," So the one, one of the things that I do here from young people is. "
"8915290","8922470"," One of those things that I hear from young people is that, you know, even out of college, they"
"8922470","8923530"," can't get a good paint job."
"8923870","8926410"," They want you to have, you know, 10 years of experience."
"8927010","8931650"," Be a recent college grad and accept, you know, 12 bucks or 20 bucks an hour or whatever. "
"8931650","8935410"," And then, of course, be able to live in New York or Manhattan or."
"8936290","8938050"," LA or wherever Chicago."
"8938750","8942310"," I don't know, Chicago's got some pretty easy places to live to. "
"8942970","8946130"," But the one thing I remember growing up was that."
"8946950","8947910"," My father."
"8949210","8950590"," Well, a couple things. "
"8950730","8954630"," When I was young, I remember when New York, I did an internship."
"8956030","8959110"," In New York for my schooling."
"8959830","8960310"," And. "
"8963150","8970250"," I got there right at the start of when Rudy Giuliani is a fucking monster now."
"8970850","8973570"," I don't know if like the lizard people took him over or something like."
"8973810","8975930"," Just put his skin over him like that. "
"8976430","8979790"," But back in the day, New York was a really fucking bad place."
"8980650","8987290"," I don't know how I don't know how well this isn't like when, when New York, when Brooklyn was cool."
"8987990","8989850"," Or so bro, became a thing. "
"8991630","8994170"," But New York was a really rough place, dangerous place."
"8994370","8995890"," Boston was a really dangerous place."
"8997550","8998970"," Even he is crazy. "
"8999850","9004030"," If you think back to Santa Monica, California, back in the 80s."
"9004990","9006010"," Not the 90s."
"9006090","9009570"," It started to be gentrified the 90s, but Santa Monica was a fucking shithole. "
"9010070","9011310"," Venice shithole."
"9013910","9014430"," And."
"9016150","9018910"," People will move to those places that were cheap to live. "
"9019590","9024430"," And they of course became gentrified, which is not a good thing, right?"
"9024570","9026110"," This is bad parts about gentrification."
"9026110","9028490"," But that's the key is that."
"9030490","9033970"," Young people took their took themselves into these cities. "
"9034490","9038890"," And these places all around the country and they built homes for themselves where it was cheap."
"9039490","9041310"," And that's one thing that I don't hear."
"9041810","9048850"," Like in the company of today, I don't hear people saying, well, I moved to this small, this place"
"9048850","9053510"," that is a shithole and I'm building the ground up there. "
"9054670","9055510"," Just don't hear it."
"9055630","9056150"," I don't hear that."
"9056990","9064050"," What I hear is, well, I can't afford this, but I want to live in fucking Santa Monica or I"
"9064050","9067910"," want to live in Manhattan or I want to live in Brooklyn or I want to live in. "
"9067910","9069170"," You name the place, right?"
"9069290","9069810"," You just name it."
"9070350","9071510"," I want to live in Austin."
"9072010","9073630"," I want to live in Charleston. "
"9073770","9078990"," When in reality, we live in like Nashville or, you know, one of these smaller places that are"
"9078990","9079330"," coming up."
"9079450","9080490"," So that's, you got my point."
"9081170","9088090"," So my point behind that, though, is there are cities or even just towns or cities or applicant"
"9088090","9093430"," places that a young person can move and get a great job. "
"9096470","9100290"," They probably have an opinion about these places that is inaccurate."
"9101450","9102830"," Now they will always have everything."
"9103310","9105350"," So Detroit's one of those places that sounds familiar today. "
"9105530","9108270"," They don't have an ocean, but they got these huge lakes."
"9108490","9109650"," They got inland lake oceans."
"9110750","9114170"," So unless you're surfing and you can, people still surf here, but it ain't West Coast surfing. "
"9115590","9120710"," You know, or if you're not a skier or snowboarder, they've got some great single tracks here for"
"9120710","9123130"," mountain biking, but they don't have a lot of downhill here."
"9123590","9124650"," Something like a downhill bike."
"9124810","9125590"," It's not going to work for you. "
"9125710","9131450"," But if you're a road biker, it's a great place to ride single track."
"9131750","9136410"," If you're not a big skier, but you like to fly to ski or don't mind flying to ski, it's"
"9136410","9137130"," a great place to live."
"9137450","9142050"," Detroit specifically builds itself as a shithole and it's not. "
"9142490","9143830"," I don't know why it's built like that."
"9145530","9151810"," Downtown is downtown looks like Brooklyn when it was being gentrified in the fucking late 90s or"
"9151810","9152630"," early 2000s."
"9152630","9154950"," Looks the same same artists, same musicians. "
"9156270","9159010"," They have some of the best engineering schools here in the nation."
"9159530","9163230"," Some of the wealthiest communities in the metro Detroit area."
"9163450","9164630"," This is getting very bullish, isn't it?"
"9165830","9167090"," Getting uber bullish. "
"9169950","9172090"," Some flat again right now, if you want to know."
"9173130","9174710"," This is looking mighty bullish to me."
"9176610","9184190"," And I think part of that wide Detroit has that image is one that's an easy dog to kick. "
"9185850","9188230"," Like New York at one time was an easy dog to kick."
"9188890","9191870"," This is looking back into like the late 80s, early 90s."
"9192390","9193050"," Boston was the same. "
"9193210","9198190"," Anyways, my dad took my dad moved us to Boston and Boston had cheap housing, Boston had bad"
"9198190","9198450"," schools."
"9199010","9200730"," And we grew up there."
"9200730","9203090"," And that community over time, people moved there. "
"9203190","9204370"," People improved the schools."
"9204630","9205410"," They improved their communities."
"9206590","9211210"," They became friends with locals and rather than trying to tell them what they were going to do,"
"9211290","9213410"," just help locals rise up as well. "
"9213630","9217430"," That's another part of Detroit is, you know, and I'm going to move to a place like this and be"
"9217430","9218950"," like, I'm going to help you people out."
"9218950","9223050"," You always want to be like, Hey, how do I help you move up, right?"
"9223570","9225930"," You help your common man, your neighbor and all that kind of stuff."
"9225930","9232230"," So I was thinking about doing a documentary on Detroit specifically and the investment that's here,"
"9232870","9234970"," the capital investment in the city. "
"9236430","9237490"," And that's Bush."
"9239070","9239930"," Look at that."
"9241610","9242950"," So look at that. "
"9243030","9243250"," It's beautiful."
"9243710","9245090"," One, two, three move up."
"9245850","9247050"," Trade this up into the web. "
"9252170","9262060"," So I was thinking about doing that documentary about, about, not quite, not just quite"
"9262060","9270580"," documentary, but I was thinking about doing it so that, like, start to finish."
"9271060","9276100"," And you could probably apply this to any up and coming place or a cheap place that's up and coming."
"9276100","9280760"," So just to remind you, in five minutes time, we are expecting an introductory remarks from Feds"
"9280760","9285060"," Bill Ant in a prerecorded introductory remarks at a virtual community development event. "
"9285300","9286840"," No media Q&A expected here."
"9288460","9295580"," So we've got, uh, clear this out right here."
"9299260","9300720"," Moving into the end of the day now. "
"9303040","9304700"," So I was going to start to finish."
"9304920","9310680"," Like if you want to do something like this, like where, like, start would be how to identify the"
"9310680","9312200"," cities that you can actually afford."
"9313420","9314780"," The best way to buy those houses. "
"9316820","9320440"," How much to expect pay and then how to renovate them."
"9321640","9325300"," How to move there, how to live, how to live when you move there, how to get a job there,"
"9325460","9326540"," how to get a great paying job there."
"9327900","9328820"," What to look for in these cities. "
"9329500","9332780"," So the cost of living here in Detroit to this area."
"9333900","9337440"," If you make like $50,000 a year, you're doing very well."
"9337800","9342560"," If you make $90,000, $120,000, you're doing like wealthy. "
"9343120","9350840"," If you're making six figures plus like $150,000, you can do whatever you want."
"9351540","9354300"," If you make a $90,000, $120,000, you can travel the world."
"9354820","9355900"," You can go and ski vacations. "
"9356440","9357740"," And that's the things that we do."
"9358360","9361080"," We'll take vacations where we want to go."
"9362020","9366420"," And then the key here, too, is we used to live in nice places. "
"9366420","9372480"," We used to live in Vale and Santa Fe in California, but we never were able to."
"9373480","9379040"," The reason we moved here specifically was because I wasn't able to generate real wealth."
"9380520","9386080"," And real wealth is very different than pay. "
"9386860","9389500"," I own a half million dollar home or a million dollar home."
"9389500","9393140"," I pay my mortgage and I've got $100,000 truck and I pay that."
"9394100","9395900"," And I pay for this and that. "
"9396120","9397320"," I got great schools and all that kind of stuff."
"9398080","9400360"," Because I've got great schools here, too, believe it or even for kids."
"9400760","9405560"," We got a thing called, there's a country day school up the road here that's really excellent. "
"9407580","9413900"," But the point they're trying to make to you is that oftentimes you look at older people that are"
"9413900","9415660"," doing well or considered well off."
"9415660","9422960"," And once they go to retirement, they have a medical issue or the economy turns for the worse and"
"9422960","9424360"," you see people lose their homes."
"9425180","9432960"," These are like either new rich, oftentimes new rich, or upper middle class. "
"9433500","9437700"," Not the middle class or the wealthy do very well."
"9437880","9440780"," Poor people are just people with trades do very well."
"9440780","9444900"," But there's this like class of people that lose everything usually. "
"9446360","9447560"," And it's usually hush hush."
"9447700","9448340"," Not talked about the news."
"9448640","9449340"," You don't hear about it. "
"9449960","9450500"," Talked about the news."
"9451080","9451640"," You see it though."
"9451760","9453320"," You'll see it amongst family members and friends. "
"9453540","9454900"," As you get older, you'll know more about this."
"9455620","9459420"," What happens is you don't really, you're not, you haven't really gained it."
"9459540","9461220"," You haven't really gained what you think you gained something. "
"9461380","9462720"," You're like, yeah, I gained my house."
"9462920","9464200"," I bought my house for a few thousand dollars."
"9464500","9467680"," I paid the mortgage 20 years and then I made another two or three hundred thousand dollars. "
"9467680","9470580"," Well, that three hundred thousand dollars at the point of years ain't nothing."
"9471000","9475520"," It's not nothing for the money that you put in that house done, done, like going around months for"
"9475520","9475820"," hours."
"9478400","9480900"," So, but anyways, real wealth is, so I did that. "
"9481320","9481900"," That's what I did."
"9482120","9486960"," Like I was doing that, that main main line U.S. This is how you do things."
"9488220","9491000"," And cyclically, it didn't seem like it would pay off when I got older. "
"9492760","9494240"," So I moved to one of these areas."
"9494240","9498260"," My dad did the same thing and it benefited him as well."
"9498520","9501880"," So for me, it's worked out very well. "
"9502080","9506860"," My children are able to experience different cultures."
"9507860","9512600"," My, it forces us into doing things we wouldn't normally do."
"9513500","9516560"," It kept me active and young as I get older. "
"9516980","9519880"," Who should be receiving Feds Billard's introductory remarks?"
"9521120","9521880"," And then I'm building wealth."
"9521880","9526220"," Instead of just paying a mortgage down and constantly being under that crux, right?"
"9526360","9528860"," Or remorgaging, refinancing, all that kind of stuff."
"9529020","9532160"," Able to actually own something physical. "
"9533000","9535580"," Something that I don't have any risk of being taken away from me."
"9536100","9537380"," Something that can make me money."
"9538380","9541940"," Matter of fact, I just paid off a mortgage on a house. "
"9542680","9545440"," And it's free money for the rest of my life."
"9546180","9547340"," It's free money."
"9548900","9551260"," And it's something that I can always pass down to my kids. "
"9551580","9555760"," If my kids are ever homeless, poor ex-college students."
"9556500","9558760"," Or if they have a problem, it's always there for them."
"9559060","9560220"," And all the stuff goes into a trust. "
"9562120","9563520"," And well, that's what wealthy people do."
"9563760","9567180"," Wealthy people, they buy stuff and they never, ever sell it."
"9567660","9569780"," And these are things that don't really lose value. "
"9570400","9572780"," And it's shocking because there's an image out there like Detroit sucks."
"9572780","9581060"," But the reality is that took place back in the late, oh, it started in the 70s, 60, late 60s,"
"9581180","9581380"," 70s."
"9582280","9585180"," They got real bad into early 2000s. "
"9586220","9588640"," And then investment came in and bought everything up in Detroit."
"9589340","9597120"," The past five years or so, like right now, you can still hear by $5,000 to $20,000 houses"
"9597120","9603300"," and neighborhoods that are being renovated and rejuvenated with anchor stores and anchor schools"
"9603300","9603920"," and other stuff."
"9604300","9608980"," And you can turn, you can sell these houses for $150, $200, $250,000. "
"9610440","9611740"," It doesn't seem like a lot."
"9612880","9613360"," But it is."
"9613540","9615980"," When you buy a $20,000 house, you put $50,000 into it. "
"9616600","9620680"," And you can charge $1,500 to $2,000 a month for rent."
"9622080","9622600"," It's a lot of money."
"9622980","9625880"," It's also a lot of money when you're going to sell something like that. "
"9625880","9632740"," And furthermore, if the economy tanks, if I'm buying houses, let's say in Vale, say I buy a $750 "
"9632740","9637480",",000 house in Vale and try to flip it and the buyers go away."
"9637580","9639840"," The first places they go away are places like Vale."
"9640600","9643300"," It's the first place that the recession's in. "
"9643900","9649900"," And then I'm stuck in an upside down with a mortgage, more than likely with a sometime of a loan"
"9649900","9653160"," that I have to fucking close within six months or a year."
"9654160","9658820"," You know, you get people get fucked, flippers get fucked, renovators get fucked."
"9659680","9661860"," People talk about, I don't know why people don't talk about this stuff. "
"9662520","9664140"," Man, I want to buy this so bad right now."
"9667120","9668380"," It's already in calls though."
"9668600","9669780"," So I'm like, I don't want to buy anymore calls. "
"9671780","9673740"," So people get fucked all the time in these deals."
"9674320","9677960"," When you're buying like a $20,000 house, it's not that bad."
"9678300","9679180"," And you're at rock bottom. "
"9679180","9687300"," So you'll always have a renter, middle-class renter, lower middle-class renter, a poor person"
"9687300","9691000"," that's going to rent the houses in these places, working-class people."
"9691860","9701260"," So just like the risk plus the cost, all that stuff has been done nothing but paying"
"9701260","9702640"," spades for me."
"9704400","9705980"," And so that was the one thing. "
"9706100","9708260"," And when I see his kids, I'm like, man, I'm like, somebody's fucking kids."
"9708260","9710120"," I'm like, you just bite the bullet."
"9710640","9711740"," You go to one of these places. "
"9711860","9713420"," You help with the community."
"9713420","9717340"," You help with the town, the city, wherever it is, you build up the community and the house."
"9718120","9719280"," You attract other people there. "
"9719560","9720280"," That's already happening."
"9720480","9721260"," It's been happening here."
"9722340","9725320"," And then we were up for contention. "
"9725680","9729060"," First in a comment again from NATO, Stuffed and Bikes, is that NATO, Russia."
"9729300","9731520"," Links are at the lowest level since the Cold War."
"9734920","9738920"," Amazon had whittled us down as a contender to bring Amazon here. "
"9739040","9740740"," We probably would have turned into Portland if that had happened."
"9741380","9743200"," But still you would have made money from that deal."
"9743980","9750900"," Ford just really, or just designed a place for EV companies to"
"9750900","9757220"," do research on EV industry. "
"9759280","9764880"," This is one of the best engineering schools in the nation are here in Michigan, believe it or not."
"9767060","9769740"," And even though auto manufacturing is not here."
"9771360","9774720"," The outsourcing of the engineering in the surrounding areas is just massive. "
"9776980","9778380"," In the metro Detroit area."
"9778380","9784700"," So if you're an engineer, if you're a doctor, if you're any kind of a professional musician, an"
"9784700","9786780"," artist, this is an easy place to live."
"9788540","9792140"," It actually makes something tangible. "
"9792860","9796660"," Like you put money in and you get money out of what you're putting in."
"9796960","9802000"," And it's something that you can say, I've got 20 grand or 10 grand."
"9802680","9803440"," I've got $100,000. "
"9803860","9804500"," I've got a half million."
"9805280","9805700"," I've got a million."
"9806140","9808080"," And I'm not risking it on fucking Bitcoin. "
"9810100","9811300"," Or a doge."
"9813800","9815160"," Or something like that."
"9816640","9819180"," It's something tangible that increases in value. "
"9819320","9821300"," It's something that you can actually do yourself."
"9822460","9826820"," And what's cool is a place like this is that people are open to you."
"9826940","9828440"," Like the city is open to you come in here. "
"9828780","9831000"," They want you to take your open businesses here."
"9831120","9833940"," They want you to bring your degree here."
"9834140","9835180"," They want you to settle here. "
"9836300","9837160"," There you go."
"9837740","9840340"," Spy, spy, squeeze it up now into VWAP."
"9843640","9845320"," Nice squeeze in a VWAP here. "
"9852760","9854620"," Beautiful squeeze of an VWAP here."
"9856460","9858340"," Let's see if those dollars have come back above"
"9858340","9867140"," or"
"9867140","9870320"," not."
"9870320","9871560"," I'm in some calls. "
"9883960","9886420"," So, so I'm in 382s."
"9891400","9892240"," So, yeah."
"9893300","9895960"," The trip is just one of the many cities though. "
"9896160","9898060"," There's cities all over the country that are like this."
"9898980","9901900"," So, I was going to do a documentary from start to finish."
"9902680","9906420"," Pitfalls, how to hire people to help you, what to look for, how to pay people. "
"9908240","9910020"," Structuring deals, who to buy them from."
"9910660","9911720"," See if they can break through this VWAP."
"9912080","9915460"," See if they can attack this 381 50 would be nice. "
"9923610","9930590"," I'm going to move this, I'm going to put a lemon there."
"9935890","9936810"," 381 50."
"9938190","9940230"," So, this is 381 50 right here. "
"9941350","9943090"," See if you can trade this higher, 381 50."
"9946910","9948610"," So, I'm going to do like start to finish, right?"
"9948750","9952410"," I was going to drive, my friend was going to use Detroit as like the model for it."
"9952650","9956210"," So, I'm like, I'll go around, I'll show you what Detroit actually is like. "
"9956450","9958610"," Not what you see on YouTube, not what you see on news."
"9960010","9966950"," I'll take some video at like the Eastern market and I'll take some video of neighborhoods and some"
"9966950","9969110"," of the investments that are going on here."
"9969110","9973530"," And then just do a whole entire start to finish. "
"9973730","9979550"," Now, let's begin to release that on YouTube so that if the young person is like, I don't even know"
"9979550","9981910"," how to start something like that or go about something like that."
"9984450","9988490"," If they're, this would be like a roadmap for that."
"9991390","9993470"," Sorry, I'm watching the market right now. "
"9999230","9999670"," Yeah."
"10000170","10001570"," So, positives are living here."
"10001850","10002550"," I gave all the negatives. "
"10004270","10007350"," Food scene is an insane right now."
"10008310","10009110"," Right here."
"10009610","10010850"," So, 379 and 39. "
"10011770","10012990"," The food scene here is insane."
"10013870","10015190"," The, then you've got caught."
"10015410","10017630"," It's not, I wouldn't say the food scene is as good as the south. "
"10018590","10020010"," For original food scene."
"10020210","10023650"," My favorite food scene in the whole world country is the south."
"10025370","10031090"," One of the most American food scenes, original food scenes in the US is the south. "
"10031430","10034250"," And if there was a seat of it, it's probably South Carolina."
"10036610","10040430"," Well, if you're a fan of American food scene is probably bad."
"10040710","10041210"," I eat everywhere. "
"10041490","10041930"," I eat New York."
"10042110","10043590"," I eat San Francisco."
"10044970","10045770"," Fucking Chicago. "
"10047450","10047850"," Linea."
"10049010","10050630"," I eat the girl in the fucking goat."
"10050790","10051290"," I've eaten there. "
"10051730","10052210"," I've eaten it."
"10052350","10054270"," All the James Beard winners out in fucking Oakland."
"10055190","10055630"," The one step. "
"10055830","10057510"," My favorite restaurants around Oakland."
"10057690","10058030"," Believe it or not."
"10058150","10058710"," Not even San Francisco. "
"10061970","10063250"," Oh, damn that's fast."
"10063730","10064170"," Nothing here."
"10064170","10067310"," Man, I'm not getting a fucking deal here in this fuck. "
"10067450","10068910"," This sucks right now."
"10076790","10078330"," I can tell you what a pinner."
"10081170","10084490"," So, so the point, the point I'm trying to make is that. "
"10085810","10087390"," I think time for just one second."
"10097410","10098990"," So the point I'm trying to make is that."
"10102170","10107810"," If I make this documentary, I think it would be a nice outline like a road map that someone that"
"10107810","10109070"," wants to do something like this could do. "
"10109710","10110730"," We'll see how that goes."
"10111450","10113030"," Anyways, can I have some water please?"
"10114770","10115170"," Nope."
"10121470","10126690"," And so I might give an option to young people to like be a little bit more daring. "
"10132030","10133350"," James worked at a linea."
"10135590","10136650"," No shit."
"10137310","10138790"," James, what did you do at a linea?"
"10142070","10143790"," What was your, were you a Comey?"
"10145690","10147830"," So James, I was in the restaurant business. "
"10148610","10153030"," I was in the fine dining restaurant business."
"10153290","10154110"," Very fine dining too."
"10155630","10157350"," What was your position at a linea?"
"10157510","10158250"," Were you just a stage?"
"10158610","10159690"," Did you stage there?"
"10159850","10160350"," Did you work there?"
"10161070","10161430"," Who were you?"
"10162790","10163690"," Talk to me, Goose. "
"10165770","10166430"," That's right."
"10166430","10168570"," You did pick herbs for 12 hours."
"10169370","10171070"," Probably with fucking tweezers too. "
"10173970","10175810"," You answered it honestly at least."
"10179330","10180450"," Thank you love."
"10185250","10187530"," And then you can get a job wherever you want. "
"10189430","10195550"," I remember when I got my first, like my first, I worked for a top 10 restaurant."
"10196710","10197930"," And that was it."
"10199030","10199430"," Yeah. "
"10199550","10202110"," I don't know how you do."
"10202310","10204630"," So that restaurant, I'm not going to name this restaurant."
"10205350","10209170"," This restaurant that I worked in was considered one of the top 10 in the US. "
"10211350","10212790"," And even the owners."
"10215530","10219770"," We're like, if you need a prescription for Adderall, we know a doctor for you."
"10220470","10221430"," So you can focus. "
"10223090","10227770"," And the work was seven days a week."
"10228010","10228370"," That's seven."
"10228610","10230450"," Like usually six, seven days a week. "
"10231510","10231990"," Relentless."
"10232250","10234670"," The 98 counts parties take two spots, two, two days."
"10234950","10236810"," Seven trillion at the Federal Street by operation. "
"10239540","10240760"," Yeah, they do it, James."
"10241400","10242040"," It's fucking brutal."
"10243260","10244800"," And places like that, they do. "
"10249640","10250640"," Place like any of it."
"10250860","10251280"," They fucking."
"10252920","10253440"," It's a red. "
"10253540","10254380"," It's just for your resume."
"10259280","10261240"," I have done a stage at the French laundry."
"10262300","10263520"," I have done a stage there. "
"10264540","10265200"," I've done some stuff."
"10265620","10267000"," So stages aren't that hard to get."
"10267980","10270740"," But you get hired on a staff in a restaurant. "
"10270740","10272580"," That's a whole not a whole other thing."
"10273160","10274740"," A whole not a thing."
"10277320","10278260"," Stages are fun. "
"10281600","10283200"," Internships are good where it's at too."
"10290740","10294980"," My favorite part about French laundry is how they tell everybody that the fucking vegetables come"
"10294980","10296560"," from the fucking garden and they don't."
"10298060","10299340"," They do, but they don't. "
"10309100","10311140"," Get the tour of the garden of French laundry."
"10317720","10318160"," Yeah."
"10321260","10325760"," Who's the guy that was the father of all that?"
"10326400","10327280"," I figured his name that chef. "
"10328060","10329240"," People don't put him anymore."
"10329560","10332780"," But who's the guy that used to do tweezers with the little."
"10334020","10334940"," The little. "
"10337140","10339320"," Brumois pieces ball perfectly around the plate."
"10339660","10344500"," That's the start of real American cuisine or professional American cooking, I guess."
"10346220","10351280"," He was from the 90s or 70s and 90s. "
"10351280","10352520"," No, I love Ron."
"10352760","10355940"," He wasn't the beginning though."
"10357560","10358760"," He's we're talking about. "
"10360140","10363160"," Yeah, it's equally that's right."
"10363600","10366100"," In Spain, baby south of Spain."
"10369360","10370480"," I've got those books somewhere. "
"10371240","10373620"," I've got the I've got the original two black books."
"10376040","10379720"," I think they cost me like 600 fucking dollars or something stupid."
"10380300","10383260"," There's a guy before having American that I'm thinking of. "
"10383600","10385080"," Oh, I'll get his name tonight."
"10387660","10390780"," God, I've got a dog cost averaging these fucking calls."
"10397800","10400240"," I figured his name is an old American chef. "
"10404150","10405110"," He's from New York."
"10406110","10407030"," He had an end."
"10409230","10410250"," That guy is good. "
"10410310","10411810"," There's another guy with an end down in the."
"10416450","10418490"," The end of the shit."
"10418770","10420970"," I'll think about it tonight. "
"10423350","10425430"," No, Keller was an asshole."
"10426010","10426330"," I knew Keller."
"10427270","10427890"," He was an asshole. "
"10429310","10431050"," Wolfgang Puck, I never met him but heard stories."
"10433030","10435190"," I've heard people say that he was good at one time."
"10435190","10435890"," I'm not James Barrett. "
"10436090","10436630"," That's too early."
"10438670","10439870"," I've cooked at the Barrett house."
"10441010","10443030"," If any of you have ever cooked at the Barrett house, it sucks. "
"10443970","10445430"," It's got this nasty fucking flight of stairs."
"10447670","10449310"," It was a good experience, of course."
"10452110","10453230"," I shouldn't say I cooked. "
"10454670","10457550"," I was invited to help another chef."
"10459450","10460170"," Keller was an asshole."
"10460470","10461110"," He's a fucking monster. "
"10463210","10464110"," He's a real prick."
"10465690","10469130"," I know some of these guys out there."
"10469850","10475030"," If you guys start name-dropping chefs, I'll tell you if I like them or if I hated them. "
"10477810","10478990"," You interviewed at Spago?"
"10479290","10480250"," Yeah, I always heard good things."
"10480890","10484050"," I heard good things, so I heard bad things."
"10484890","10486090"," Fuck, they're going to sell it. "
"10489770","10491410"," This market fucking blows."
"10492630","10494750"," Complete matter fucking dog shit right here."
"10500250","10503790"," Spago is, yeah, I'm out right now. "
"10503910","10506110"," I'm just staying out right now."
"10506810","10507910"," I just got chewed up."
"10508090","10509070"," I didn't get chewed up on the puts. "
"10509910","10510950"," I almost broke even on those."
"10511150","10512590"," The calls I got chewed up on though."
"10513230","10514450"," I'm just going to stay out right now. "
"10514450","10515390"," I'm not bothering."
"10515610","10518330"," I mean, this looks like a fucking, like we're going down right here."
"10518410","10520230"," We might go down, but I don't even want to play it. "
"10520910","10522090"," It's not worth it."
"10524430","10526950"," I don't even want to trade this down here."
"10527970","10529190"," Can I see my cursor right here?"
"10529830","10530610"," I want nothing to do with it. "
"10533010","10533750"," Just trapping."
"10535370","10536830"," I heard good things about Spago."
"10537110","10543570"," When Wolfgang got older, people were making fun of him and how his expansion he started doing like"
"10543570","10545050"," pasta places and also their nonsense. "
"10545690","10546350"," But they all do it."
"10546690","10551730"," They all have to sell each other out at some point, right?"
"10552050","10552730"," Well, not all of them."
"10552790","10558570"," I guess they were all Marco Perry White says he didn't sell himself up, but I just watched the"
"10558570","10563030"," recent fucking video from his ass and he's fucking sold his ass out now. "
"10563670","10566810"," If you watched him fucking cooking now, you're like, what the fuck is he doing?"
"10569570","10570890"," Yeah, there's no trend right now."
"10574330","10575490"," But I always heard good things."
"10575570","10577330"," Oh, Grant's a badass. "
"10579070","10579790"," He's a badass."
"10582770","10583650"," Michael Mina's."
"10584050","10585450"," I know a little bit about Michael Mina. "
"10585710","10587330"," I'll keep him all shut about Michael Mina."
"10589890","10591610"," None of the celebrity chefs."
"10594690","10600430"," This guy was kind of a celebrity chef, but he wasn't before it was more like a professional chef. "
"10600670","10605290"," Before there were celebrity chefs, Bobby Flay is a fucking douche."
"10605450","10605830"," I know him."
"10606070","10606730"," He's douchebag. "
"10607710","10613410"," So a lot of those food network chefs, I've worked side by side some of those men and women."
"10614730","10620670"," Not side by side, but they've done like episodes and shit and restaurants have managed."
"10627130","10628910"," As a genius, this rags my dad. "
"10634430","10639750"," Yeah, Bobby Flay is a fucking douche, very well-known douche."
"10644550","10646790"," Oh, you know, fucking, you know, it's hilarious."
"10648530","10652790"," Who's the Mario Batali?"
"10654630","10658830"," Before all that stuff came out with him in Boston, dude, he used to be known in New York. "
"10659750","10660730"," Huge co-core."
"10661670","10661830"," Huge."
"10661830","10663910"," Can't believe we're talking about this stuff. "
"10672400","10673860"," You guys have a Jose Andreas?"
"10675800","10677260"," I don't know Jose well."
"10678680","10681540"," My buddy said he's a no."
"10682760","10686120"," I've never met a Andreas behind the scenes. "
"10686820","10688480"," I've never met Admiral behind the scenes."
"10690400","10695320"," There's that guy from Oumofuku, not a husband wife, not that guy."
"10698340","10699560"," I'm not thinking about Oumofuku. "
"10699720","10701840"," I'm thinking about a different Asian guy."
"10702880","10705260"," He's really tall and big, huge guy."
"10705880","10706660"," He was really nice. "
"10707780","10709020"," And I can't remember his name right now."
"10710260","10711900"," Trotter was an asshole too."
"10714280","10717160"," His daughter though, I liked his daughter. "
"10717860","10721620"," Does she have the, she's, she's the girl in the go, right?"
"10723800","10725340"," Uh, David Chang's a bad ass."
"10725580","10726000"," He's a pro."
"10728700","10730020"," I don't know Daniel Hum. "
"10732380","10734800"," Please comment for Dear Lord, for Dear God."
"10740260","10742180"," There's not shit going on in this market."
"10742760","10743900"," Not a fucking thing. "
"10744980","10745360"," Look at this."
"10745500","10746420"," Just fucking brutal."
"10748300","10749820"," This is ultra nasty. "
"10750300","10752300"," Let's take a look around the market and see what's going on."
"10753020","10754360"," Vix is pumping right now."
"10754820","10755720"," Vix is looking bullish. "
"10756580","10758040"," XLK is going to fall off the cliff."
"10759900","10760300"," XLF."
"10761220","10762340"," Let's take a look at this real quick. "
"10764980","10766680"," Rick Bayless was good at one time."
"10767620","10769240"," Yes, this is, this is, uh, stinkiness."
"10769580","10770820"," Let's take a look around the market real quick. "
"10773840","10774160"," Okay."
"10774480","10775380"," Well, I don't have that."
"10775580","10775900"," I don't have that. "
"10775960","10777360"," So I just, this is a new Webull."
"10778820","10781880"," Uh, I don't know why, but this is pretty bullish."
"10782480","10783420"," Just take a word for it. "
"10783640","10784540"," I've got it open somewhere else."
"10784560","10785240"," I'll try it out."
"10786920","10789040"," It's a fairly fucking bullish here in the three minutes chart. "
"10789740","10790060"," Let's take a look."
"10790200","10790560"," Look around."
"10790680","10790820"," Okay. "
"10791460","10792900"," Uh, this is not a good look for XLK."
"10794560","10796900"," We can definitely see that this is not a good look for XLK."
"10798020","10800320"," Uh, XLF. "
"10801320","10803180"," This is the driver of the market, right?"
"10803660","10806260"," When you see stuff like this, this is a good thing to look at."
"10806820","10807860"," It's going to be a good lesson."
"10809500","10812000"," Like trading the market, trading spy, trading your favorite stock. "
"10812200","10814220"," We're going to look around the market and see what's going on."
"10815600","10816860"," XLF is a big waiter."
"10819000","10822960"," And how the market drives, especially like your tech stock stuff like that. "
"10823960","10825000"," Keep it right below tech here."
"10825600","10826300"," This is not healthy."
"10826540","10829460"," You don't like seeing XLF showing this weakness right now. "
"10829460","10832300"," Uh, we'll take a look at XLE week."
"10832580","10834900"," You don't want to see XLE week either, believe it or not."
"10835920","10837440"," We're in combination with these other ones. "
"10838160","10840200"," XLV, pretty positive on the day."
"10840860","10843560"," Talked about that at the open this morning and said, um, like in XLV."
"10843880","10845020"," It's had a good day so far. "
"10845260","10846460"," You want to see this, right?"
"10847160","10849340"," What is doing well in this shitty market right now?"
"10849540","10850580"," XLV is doing well."
"10851840","10854060"," XLRE, this is looking unhealthy too, right?"
"10854300","10855640"," Not too, not too good over there."
"10856320","10857600"," XLI, not looking good. "
"10857600","10860400"," I had some interest in XLB this morning."
"10860620","10861900"," This still isn't looking good."
"10862420","10867780"," Um, and I'm going to look back on this too because they're at $73.98. This is a retest is"
"10867780","10868300"," my question. "
"10868400","10870940"," We're retesting this low for a move higher, right?"
"10871080","10873840"," Does this form the double bottom or do we break here?"
"10874640","10877340"," So we'll go back to XL or VIX afterwards."
"10879100","10886380"," XLY, man, nasty, straight nasty."
"10888760","10890480"," XLP, eh, not too bad. "
"10892640","10893440"," XLU, nasty."
"10894540","10897220"," NASDAQ, down 40 points, rechecking the lows from prior."
"10898860","10901420"," Oh man, I want to trade this so bad. "
"10903040","10906920"," Like the most risk in the market right now, but the most payoff is in an IAW."
"10907080","10909680"," They got some fucking huge gaps in IAWM right now."
"10910600","10912740"," Huge monster gaps in IAWM. "
"10914220","10914780"," Huge!"
"10916320","10917720"," Look at that nastiness."
"10918440","10920400"," Pure destruction on IAWM."
"10921000","10928820"," Mmm, mmm, mmm. "
"10929180","10931500"," I'd probably try to try this out right now, shouldn't I?"
"10937260","10939100"," It's a good kind of fucking bullish to me."
"10954500","10956100"," Okay, buddy, fuck a boss to me."
"10985190","10993710"," Support here. "
"10998430","11000250"," Lower high, lower high."
"11011930","11014570"," I like seeing that lower high on the VIX."
"11035200","11040060"," Alright, I'm back in 382Cs, 26 cents. "
"11048730","11050750"," I'm looking for this crossover here."
"11052730","11057410"," I'm going to take some profit here already, that's how fucking fast."
"11063830","11066410"," So I'm looking at VIX right now. "
"11071030","11073070"," And I like this cross right here."
"11073410","11076930"," I want to see this cross turn into a rollover on the VIX."
"11081770","11085710"," I want to see this happen here, I want to see some kind of a trade lower here. "
"11087670","11089170"," That's what I'm looking for in the VIX."
"11107890","11109770"," Somebody calls currently on the spy."
"11109770","11129450"," Bye. "
"11144650","11146770"," Alright, this is like a non-start right here."
"11148570","11150470"," Lots of spy calls coming in right"
"11150470","11159430"," now."
"11159430","11166930"," I'm looking for a 2% gap up tomorrow just because what they're doing is burning premium right now. "
"11169270","11171170"," Intentionally burning fucking premium."
"11171670","11174050"," That's the intent of this, which sucks."
"11175770","11177610"," When this sucks, this is what it is. "
"11179310","11182170"," They're going to murder all the calls that are out there."
"11183570","11188050"," And they're going to murder all the puts that printed out there, which sucks too."
"11188270","11193030"," And then you've got the moves that are going to be made for end of month, right?"
"11194270","11196390"," For our end of quarter and end of month. "
"11196650","11201750"," So we should get some volatility from those moves, but my expectation is you're going to see them"
"11201750","11202910"," end of fucking day."
"11203370","11205370"," You're going to see these moves out of nowhere."
"11206250","11207830"," You're not going to see them coming. "
"11209750","11213270"," So if anything position yourself, that's where you think we're going."
"11216810","11219350"," And it'll probably come without you even knowing it."
"11219950","11221810"," Meanwhile, they're going to burn all this stuff down. "
"11221930","11222930"," That's what they're doing right now."
"11223550","11226070"," I'm looking at my portfolio right now."
"11226790","11229450"," It's like fucking destruction. "
"11231450","11237230"," It's like fucking you ain't printing them until you sell them."
"11238030","11239530"," Calls coming in on JPM."
"11239830","11240790"," That's good to see right now. "
"11241150","11246010"," January 20th of 23, 130 C at $290,000."
"11247410","11252870"," We know we're at a double bottom right now on XLF."
"11260210","11263930"," So normally, I would train a theta play. "
"11264170","11264890"," So that's a good question."
"11264990","11267310"," Jill's saying, why don't I do a theta trade today?"
"11268310","11272170"," There's my own reasons for some under normal circumstances."
"11273050","11278890"," I would pick if we were consolidating or if we were consolidating without being in. "
"11278890","11283270"," In quarter end, monthly end."
"11283670","11288030"," I would normally if I knew that we would have two or three or four or five days of consolidation"
"11288030","11288650"," ahead."
"11289210","11290370"," I would do that. "
"11290650","11294350"," I don't like the risk of condors."
"11294930","11300730"," Or flies because of what happens right or what's I think my or my."
"11301750","11304870"," What my what I think's going to happen end of day. "
"11306390","11308150"," So I could I could be sitting here."
"11308350","11309490"," Let's say first 15 minutes."
"11309670","11310510"," I open up a condor. "
"11310630","11314390"," I'm not going to make the most of my money when I make towards end of day or start in"
"11314390","11315070"," the next day."
"11315830","11322370"," And I'm expecting volatility into the end of today and the end of tomorrow and the end of Friday."
"11322730","11323570"," That's my expectation. "
"11324390","11328090"," So it's too much risk in that trade for me for the way for what I'll take what I'll make."
"11331550","11334510"," If I'll trade ticks market net flow."
"11338510","11341630"," The FM is birth control biotech forming since railway news. "
"11342210","11342470"," Right on."

"11349070","11350930"," Yeah, I'm in calls right now. "
"11351270","11352110"," I think we're going up."
"11353110","11356430"," But I think they're grinding at the same time and not only I think we're going up."
"11356430","11359730"," I think volatility is going to kick in here towards end of day. "
"11359870","11360590"," I'm going to get some moves."
"11360710","11364350"," It's just like earlier in the week getting end of day moves and you're going to get overnight moves"
"11364350","11365070"," next couple days."
"11370130","11372530"," Yeah, that's why I'm afraid of a theta plays right now. "
"11372830","11374010"," I don't like the idea of theta here."
"11374550","11380710"," I think I think we weren't at the rebalancing and the Q three ending or Q two ending."
"11381210","11382190"," I'd be down with it. "
"11382770","11383890"," A hundred percent."
"11385350","11386310"," But I'm not on."
"11386450","11387430"," I'm definitely not. "

"17096670","17105710"," Okay, so this is a quick little trade Um Quick little five-minute trade right in here This is"
"17105710","17112370"," actually a really nice trade right down in here I just took this trade right here."
"17113030","17114190"," It was a nice little trade."
"17114990","17129110"," That's what happens here in the clothes I"
"17129810","17138070"," Yeah, just so the scary part about that trade is uh They are like gold trade that was down here. "
"17138290","17144770"," It's So sometimes people will say things like well, that's a hedge, but That's not a hedge You"
"17144770","17151950"," don't see people don't buy like now That doesn't mean you buy these puts right now You typically"
"17151950","17154730"," want to wait Well, let's talk about that right now."
"17154730","17161170"," So this gold came in right The key thing about this trade is okay, so it's it's short dated."
"17161390","17162290"," It's real soon. "
"17162670","17169750"," It's not like a year out This is a month away Now dealers are going to have to hedge against"
"17169750","17170230"," this trade."
"17170310","17173190"," So A dealer sees a million dollar trade command."
"17173430","17174410"," They're going to go off. "
"17174590","17174610"," Fuck."
"17174830","17180490"," No, we're not going there for you right now We need like another 10 million to come in on that"
"17180490","17186710"," trade until that happens Uh, we're actually going to counter what you're doing, right?"
"17186950","17191390"," So I'm going to take the ops inside of this trade just in case i'm going to take the trade"
"17191390","17197950"," with you in case it goes there And that basically and then i'm also going to uh counter that trade"
"17197950","17202210"," as well in case it goes the other way so Uh, we get gold and we're going to look at"
"17202210","17207430"," gold real quick Well, it was just they just had it up on my my chart over here So it's"
"17207430","17208590"," like you wanted to follow that trade."
"17208710","17215070"," So you're like, hey, I want to buy I want to fall because I follow big money trades So they're"
"17215070","17222750"," calling for We'll look at this right now No, it's a good good opportunity good learning exercise"
"17222750","17231910"," for flow option flow 101 So So These guys get pretty good flow. "
"17232170","17241730"," So Uh, they're saying that or someone's betting that gold is going to go down July 29th"
"17241730","17251510"," right here Um, we're gonna snap a line in here Uh, they think they think"
"17251510","17264330"," gold's going down to Hold on here They think gold is going down to It's"
"17264330","17274290"," actually not a bad trade to take right now They say 129 or something like that Damn,"
"17274530","17280690"," that's way outside the money for 132 up look at that again It's actually not a bad place to take"
"17280690","17283210"," it Where's that gold trade?"
"17284590","17294390"," 165 So 165 p right here It's their break even And I haven't checked to see how"
"17294390","17297170"," how and when it pays It's pretty substantial move."
"17297690","17302230"," Uh, this actually is a bad place to buy this, uh put right now But it will be the best"
"17302230","17307790"," place to buy it The best place to buy that trade will first you want to track the trade and"
"17307790","17312670"," see if they stay in it And the best place to buy that trade would be up here somewhere right"
"17314170","17321890"," to actually Monetize that trade so what you do here is this Uh, we are trending down right now But"
"17321890","17327010"," what you would do is you would you would watch the trade on an options chain And look to see"
"17327010","17332670"," if gold trades up briefly see this spike right here You want to see something like that happen like"
"17332670","17336890"," boom quick spike up in gold And then you want to you want to keep an eye on that trade"
"17336890","17342150"," and see if they keep adding to it Or if they stay in that trade because you might be able"
"17342150","17346990"," to still ride their coattails on the way down over here People with big money like that you put a"
"17346990","17350470"," million dollars on a trade They might be like, uh, I'm gonna throw a million at it And I'll add"
"17350470","17353510"," another 10 million if I need to because I know ultimately it's going there."
"17353610","17354090"," Does that make sense?"
"17354730","17358450"," So you might think it's a lot of money, but to them it's not and eventually they can make gold"
"17358450","17364770"," roll over and down into that one 55 or print this 165 so keep your eyes on the gold trade"
"17364770","17371410"," Um, I'll take a look later and see if I'll take a look later and see if uh, there's any"
"17371410","17377450"," more history on that trade Uh, but they're looking for gold to go down to 165 or lower makes sense"
"17378210","17383290"," Not gonna lie Doesn't sound irrational and it breaks crazy. "
"17383670","17384710"," There it is right there too."
