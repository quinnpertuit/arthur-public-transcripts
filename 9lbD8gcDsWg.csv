"260","8480"," Focus and sound level before the film begins check check Mike check all right."
"9680","11300"," Let's see what's going on here."
"14600","16080"," Check one. "
"36830","37490"," Check one."
"37490","37490"," Check one."
"37670","38050"," Check one too, baby. "
"38350","38790"," Let's do it."
"59000","59400"," Hells."
"59560","59720"," Yeah. "
"67720","69240"," Where are we doing here?"
"72960","74280"," What's going on here?"
"77440","78180"," All right."
"78520","80620"," So we'll get right into it this morning."
"80760","81340"," Hold on a second here. "
"82100","83140"," Couple things got to do."
"83600","85300"," Good morning to y'all out there."
"85880","87060"," Hope everybody's doing well. "
"87600","88840"," Everybody's having a good morning."
"88840","90280"," Good morning to y "
"90280","113300","'all."
"114890","114890"," Good morning to y'all. "
"114950","120390"," Good morning to y'all."
"120390","120390"," Good morning."
"120390","122950"," Pre-market sellers right up in here. "
"122950","124430"," Just be aware of this one as we come up."
"126190","128410"," This stream is sponsored by Tickshrike."
"129009","132130"," Tickshrike allows you to actually hear all on here in a second. "
"138710","141910"," A couple of things I got to do here in the background."
"148970","150190"," Save that."
"154000","156300"," And new chat live chat. "
"158200","161940"," That was Twitter."
"164120","168280"," Made a post this morning for Z."
"168820","170260"," Holy crescendo."
"171080","173080"," Hope that he saw it on Twitter. "
"176220","178420"," That's trade number two."
"181000","183000"," And we'll do Tesla."
"183940","186440"," Today we'll do GME today. "
"188120","189880"," We'll do the queues today."
"193080","197460"," So far I am two for two right now."
"199020","202100"," So I said I would take ten trades with croissant. "
"206160","208240"," Hopefully is still long right now."
"209920","213500"," And we're going to talk about today what to expect today, what to expect tomorrow."
"216840","218620"," How do you become a winning trader. "
"224560","230080"," How do you rebuild an account after suffering major losses."
"231480","233320"," And some weirdness going on."
"233440","239860"," I've got like Google like labs or whatever is turning all my shit like gray or whatever. "
"243200","247080"," So hopefully somebody got in touch with croissants Z."
"247200","252200"," Holy croissant and let him know that I had a trade on for him."
"256269","258649"," Those are printing quite nicely right now."
"259269","263550"," 4.41 is now trading 41 cents for tomorrow. "
"264310","266550"," 42 cents for tomorrow."
"267370","269430"," I guess we could have made that a zero date trade."
"269830","273410"," But I wanted some safety like that. "
"273650","276790"," We'll make the trade and we'll just stare at it all afternoon to the close."
"285840","286740"," Make it easy."
"289460","293020"," I want to remind you that these sellers right here. "
"297880","299700"," They're hiding out right here, right?"
"301200","304480"," We had a bear playing in pre-market."
"305360","309840"," Now supposedly we're trying to find this out."
"310160","313560"," Can we trade XSP in pre-market?"
"314500","318220"," Because I'm not seeing a pre-market on XSP anywhere. "
"319100","320960"," Someone was making that claim the other day."
"320960","322600"," I was like, I don't know."
"322900","326940"," So I suppose you can trade XSP options in pre-market. "
"326940","328460"," Maybe somebody can enlighten me to that."
"332200","335120"," We're going to take a look at something together here."
"340020","342640"," So if you're watching Z."
"342820","343460"," Holy croissant. "
"344780","346580"," You can take the money and run here if you want."
"346940","347780"," It's up to you."
"347980","348400"," I don't care. "
"348660","351540"," The only thing that I care about is that I take 10 winning trades."
"353560","356500"," However long you want to hold them, you can hold them as long as you want."
"356980","363460"," I'll do 10 winning trades with you in a row before they happen. "
"365420","375770"," And then when I want you to take classes and follow the program, you"
"375770","376310"," do that right?"
"377030","379970"," Rather than being consistently losing big trades."
"383330","385990"," There's like no reason to be losing money in this market."
"386210","388890"," Like you can lose a little bit or have a bad trade or two. "
"391330","395050"," Or if you're trying to buy a bottom or sell a top and you get cut up doing it."
"397070","397970"," That's not so bad."
"401950","406690"," You know, like things like, I'm short here and I get run all the way up here. "
"406850","409790"," That kind of stuff is just, you know, it's not the way to trade, right?"
"411630","413870"," So we're going to take a peak here at something."
"417650","425550"," Now, of course, like past the past performance is not indicative"
"425550","429110"," of future performance, right?"
"431090","433970"," But I want to show you guys something here."
"435290","437270"," It's pretty, this is pretty common. "
"447600","464690"," It's the end of quarter, end"
"464690","465770"," of Q1 right here."
"468070","489050"," It's the 28th, 29th, 30th, 31st, weekend"
"489050","489750"," right here."
"491650","501570"," So if this would were to be, let's say, say you consider this 4th of July weekend. "
"503290","505350"," This is end of quarter right here."
"507490","511010"," We had this blast up dip and then rip into the bell."
"513770","518090"," Could kind of consider this area kind of where we are right now, right?"
"525460","527220"," We've got the 30th. "
"527340","527620"," That's it."
"527780","528940"," That's all we've got left, right?"
"529680","529940"," That's it."
"530120","537660"," So when we have just this kind of shit left here, you've got boom. "
"539180","540800"," The low of the day."
"540800","546040"," And then we crank up here."
"547200","549580"," Keep on cranking, right?"
"549880","550120"," See that?"
"550680","557500"," Keep on cranking, keep on cranking window dressing into end of quarter. "
"560440","566480"," So right now, where are we?"
"567400","569080"," It's looking kind of similar, isn't it?"
"572500","573840"," It's kind of similar to me."
"580000","582480"," There's a nice dip to bite out here this morning."
"583100","584500"," Gorgeous dip down here. "
"585680","587480"," Got the double bottom right here."
"587820","589460"," Got another double bottom right here."
"591040","593160"," Just keep on cranking, right?"
"593520","594520"," Boom, come on, back in. "
"594520","595320"," Grab another one."
"595540","596620"," Yee-haw, daddy."
"599920","601420"," We're going to talk about that too. "
"602760","605860"," So yesterday I had, so I'm losing my voice, by the way."
"606320","609800"," So yesterday I had no idea that my daughter got on the stream."
"612120","615120"," She admitted it to me late last night and I was like, what?"
"619760","624160"," So yesterday I was leaving yesterday morning and she walked into my office. "
"624160","626680"," She goes, oh, daddy, are you leaving?"
"626820","627600"," I go, yes, honey bear."
"627880","630720"," She goes, can I sit in your office today?"
"630960","633800"," Of course I'm like, yeah, of course, if you want to sit in daddy's office."
"634440","635660"," You want to be like, daddy, of course. "
"636160","636500"," Heck yeah."
"637340","639860"," So I'm like, I get the stream on, but you can't touch it."
"640500","642300"," I was like, there's a button there for the microphone. "
"642560","643140"," Don't touch that."
"644000","646800"," I was like, do not touch this cursor that I have."
"647160","649620"," I was like, you can use that computer over there, though. "
"651740","653000"," Like that one's fine."
"653860","656000"," You can use these two monitors over here."
"656240","658280"," So I got cleaned up the two monitors for it to use. "
"659280","660680"," And I left, right."
"661060","662640"," So I'm doing a presentation yesterday."
"664320","668040"," And I didn't realize that she had gotten on the stream yesterday. "
"669540","671580"," And I guess some of you tipped her."
"671860","677100"," So I think today at some point or tomorrow I'm going to go down to like an ATM."
"677100","681560"," And I'll pull out like $100 in ones or something. "
"681880","686740"," And maybe I'll like dump a bucket of ones on her or something like that."
"687400","690000"," I guess you guys were raining money down on my kids, right?"
"690460","694560"," So I guess I'm like, how much money did I make yesterday?"
"694700","695740"," I'm like, why am I making money?"
"696260","697720"," I'm like, shit, I didn't make any money."
"697720","698560"," My daughter did. "
"703940","706920"," So she admitted to me last night that she got on the stream yesterday."
"706920","709340"," I'm like horrified at whatever she might have said."
"713000","715160"," My dad's part smell really bad. "
"715580","716400"," Something like that."
"720520","723120"," So just into end of today and tomorrow."
"724900","726460"," I am long here, right?"
"727940","729800"," Nothing says not to be long here. "
"734060","737740"," I saw something on the free or our fair and greed index this morning."
"738680","742880"," We're at like 73% greed already."
"750170","754630"," And yeah, I mean, I guess I'd like to I really like to see I was talking a weekend. "
"754630","755990"," I was like, you know, I really like to see."
"756770","762270"," I'd really like to see like a chart of the fair and greed index on every day."
"763070","764590"," Like we're like, let's see. "
"764690","765710"," We're at 70% greed."
"765970","767150"," I think we're at 73 right now."
"768310","769990"," How long can we stay at 73?"
"771650","772470"," How high can we go?"
"774070","775110"," Well, and while being greedy. "
"778190","781990"," Is it something where I just start short in the market and get run over, you know?"
"783890","784950"," How much does it matter?"
"790950","793110"," So we're just buying the bounce right now, right?"
"793530","795490"," Every time we hit that hourly by the bounce."
"797410","800850"," By the bounce, by the bounce, by the bounce, by the bounce, by the bounce, by the bounce, by the"
"800850","804210"," bounce, by the bounce, again, what are we trying to do with that buying the bounce?"
"807350","809110"," Until it stops working."
"812860","815180"," We all know what that is, right?"
"815180","819340"," We're trying to close some targets above. "
"821700","824740"," We got that one right there."
"825540","826340"," Already tagged it."
"828680","832400"," We got another one right there. "
"832920","836960"," 439.59. Got another one right there."
"837300","842880"," 441.54. Another one right there."
"845000","846040"," Another one right there. "
"847480","854900"," 4379.41.14. And to be honest with you, we need a new high."
"858500","862620"," So that's not good enough to me if we come up here and fail."
"865040","866540"," I want to get up there and hold it. "
"867960","873020"," Even if we trade sideways, I want that new high."
"873700","875460"," Bears do not want that new high."
"876280","877380"," Even if we have a pullback. "
"881300","882320"," So let's look above."
"889300","893600"," I was trying to ask Winky about this on the phone and I wasn't really, I don't know if I"
"893600","895220"," was getting my point across this morning."
"896480","904020"," And I'm fascinated to know if retail thinks that we can go higher. "
"908270","910490"," Does retail believe it?"
"911470","915050"," Is retail buying calls to raise the call wall?"
"919770","921870"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"924160","927690"," So next target above is above 443."
"929310","936230"," Is 449.99. We've got really bad smoke here right now too. "
"936290","937510"," Maybe that's why I'm losing my voice."
"938550","940670"," The smoke here is out of control."
"942890","944550"," Looks like that New York stuff. "
"944790","945930"," It's like just blanketing us."
"946690","952990"," Smells like Canadian geese are burning down the neighborhood or something."
"953850","955670"," Illegal, illegal cading geese immigrants. "
"957950","959690"," They're causing a ruckus in Michigan."
"961510","963590"," So right here, we're buying this hourly."
"963890","968070"," We're trying to close all this stuff above here into Friday close. "
"970510","975470"," As long as we ride this hourly up, trade is still on, right?"
"975650","977830"," As long as we just run this hourly up."
"977830","981570"," Oh, there's the fifth right there."
"985520","986760"," Just kind of like that. "
"987000","988640"," Maybe we have that push up on the fifth."
"990440","992540"," It might take us until the fifth."
"993900","995040"," I'll take it up there. "
"998790","1004930"," Saying that, saying this here, let's keep riding the hourly trigger up saying that."
"1006730","1009690"," The JPM caller is going to matter tomorrow."
"1009690","1018320"," So regardless of what we think will happen tomorrow,"
"1018320","1027790"," we'll ride this trend right here. "
"1029510","1032010"," This is pretty much the trend right here."
"1038000","1040380"," I'm interested to see what that caller is."
"1040380","1044800"," I think that it could impact the way the day goes. "
"1048480","1049960"," Just right here into tomorrow."
"1051540","1052260"," Here's Friday."
"1057120","1058380"," It's pretty steep, right?"
"1059300","1060620"," This is the fifth, I believe. "
"1061020","1061420"," I don't know why."
"1061620","1062280"," This says the throw."
"1062440","1063220"," I forgot about the third. "
"1063400","1064080"," That's nine thirty."
"1065020","1066060"," We've got a half day on."
"1066260","1067340"," Remember that's on the third. "
"1067560","1067820"," We've got."
"1070120","1072240"," That's the fourth, but that's actually going to be the fifth."
"1076400","1078660"," Now we've got a half day on the third. "
"1079520","1083760"," I think we tell me if I'm wrong on this, but I think that we trade nine thirty to one"
"1083760","1086080"," p.m. or eleven thirty something like that."
"1087780","1088800"," It's brutal outside."
"1089800","1090520"," Yeah, dude. "
"1090660","1092920"," So I was outside yesterday."
"1093880","1096900"," And the smoke was intolerable."
"1097780","1099240"," It was really fascinating outside. "
"1099520","1100700"," I was wearing a mask yesterday."
"1100700","1105340"," And I saw a bunch of kids in my neighborhood with no masks."
"1105600","1109140"," So I brought them masks and I was like, man, put this stuff on. "
"1109420","1109660"," I'm like."
"1111040","1111800"," Wear masks."
"1113300","1114560"," We get smokey out here. "
"1117440","1118700"," I am long calls."
"1119020","1123000"," If you follow me on Twitter, we bought this right here."
"1124200","1130680"," We bought that right there. "
"1130680","1130820"," Okay."
"1133840","1134660"," You want to know."
"1136560","1137800"," Long 441 C."
"1138960","1141960"," Taking trades with the holy croissant, ten of them. "
"1142100","1142760"," I promised them."
"1142840","1145500"," I said, so I'll take ten trades with you."
"1149280","1151260"," I was like, we'll see if my trades are winners. "
"1153080","1154840"," I want you to be a winning trader."
"1157320","1160880"," I said, we'll take ten trades and see if they're so far."
"1161060","1162220"," I'm two for two right now. "
"1163580","1164960"," I'm still in that trade."
"1165560","1166640"," This trade is a trade."
"1166800","1168540"," I think that you can just leave it on. "
"1170760","1171920"," Until it fucking prints."
"1172760","1176860"," Well, it's already printed, but it's trading 38 cents right now."
"1181240","1182880"," So the east coast is ugly today. "
"1182880","1185180"," It's like black outside."
"1185840","1187500"," It's like it's really bad."
"1188860","1189820"," The weather. "
"1190240","1191540"," I've got like stuffed up nose."
"1192020","1195820"," I've got my voices all messed up."
"1197180","1199960"," So trading stops at 1 p.m. on the third. "
"1200180","1201400"," Thanks for updating us with that."
"1202100","1204220"," Just be conscious of that on the third."
"1204420","1205560"," That's a very short day. "
"1209560","1213780"," There's some things that you need to realize that I want to tell you guys out there."
"1213780","1214820"," Number one."
"1215220","1216320"," I'm being serious. "
"1216620","1217540"," There's very serious stuff."
"1218680","1222940"," That JPM caller is going to be critical tomorrow."
"1223380","1225440"," So in the morning, you should get on fin to it. "
"1226020","1229280"," People track it closely and they will get the strikes."
"1229980","1230900"," Sometimes they're updated."
"1231740","1233560"," There's adjustments to them later in the morning. "
"1233800","1239160"," So you might find a number pop up in the morning and then they'll say, no, it's this number."
"1239320","1239960"," It's not that number."
"1239960","1243000"," So be open to that change in strikes. "
"1245640","1249220"," Also note that there'll be big flows tomorrow."
"1251040","1252900"," People will follow that trade."
"1253380","1254760"," The trade itself is not. "
"1257060","1262040"," On its own is not a large part of the trading that happens tomorrow."
"1263100","1266180"," But people are watching it and then they follow that trade."
"1266440","1267040"," That's the key. "
"1267040","1268940"," It's not so much the JPM trade."
"1269940","1276320"," It's that everyone's watching it and people are trading to it where you get the effect."
"1277660","1279560"," So you want to pay attention to it. "
"1279720","1283880"," You don't want to see the JPM caller the strikes lower."
"1284600","1287080"," If you do, you'll hear about it."
"1288220","1289460"," It'll be all over. "
"1290120","1291480"," People will be talking about like crazy."
"1292100","1299860"," If the strikes are the same, people will be talking about it."
"1300940","1304780"," It'll be perceived as we're going to trade sideways in Q3. "
"1305300","1310420"," That would mean that we're going to get a bottom in Q3 to expect a new low, not a new"
"1310420","1312560"," low, but a low in Q3."
"1314780","1316480"," Limit your upside expectations."
"1316480","1318520"," Limit your upside expectations more. "
"1321080","1322600"," Look for a dip to buy."
"1324120","1328760"," If the caller is higher, we could just start ramping."
"1330400","1334040"," The reaction from the market would be, oh shit, we're going up. "
"1336960","1341240"," And you likely won't hear a lot about the caller if it is higher."
"1343340","1347200"," Oftentimes, you'll see people don't want to talk about that, right?"
"1347460","1350740"," They're very quiet about it if the strikes are higher."
"1351780","1353540"," It fucks with their thesis, right?"
"1354360","1360920"," Trying to sell a bare thesis, sell fair, and that doesn't fly with the selling of fair, right?"
"1361640","1365040"," You guys know that selling fair brings followers. "
"1365380","1366000"," Do you guys know that?"
"1367060","1375120"," So if you sell fair and not the actual truth, like we're going up or going down, we're going up"
"1375120","1378960"," or going down, you're going to get followers."
"1379180","1381740"," You're going to get a couple hundred thousand followers, a million followers, whatever it is."
"1382160","1385960"," Pay attention to it tomorrow. "
"1386920","1393120"," It could impact how we close out the weekend and how we trade into the first week of July."
"1393120","1400000"," Another note here too would be, there will likely be a dip for you to buy regardless of the JPM"
"1400000","1400380"," caller."
"1401440","1403940"," The first week of July, if not the second. "
"1404780","1413600"," So if you need a week or two to let the market digest with the expectations are for Q3, you'll"
"1413600","1419320"," probably have a chance to put risk on next week or the week after."
"1419320","1423020"," There's no rush here to put risk on."
"1423300","1424640"," No, that's the last part here. "
"1426580","1427580"," We're end of corner."
"1428220","1429300"," You're going to get some window dressing."
"1429740","1431060"," We're going to go up, I assure you. "
"1432580","1439200"," There's going to be a bunch of zero dates tomorrow placed on the market, calls against the hedging"
"1439200","1440220"," flows in the market."
"1441260","1443440"," To not disturb the market."
"1444100","1447340"," Those hedging flows likely will rip tomorrow at some point. "
"1448280","1452220"," 10 30 in the morning, 1 30 in the afternoon, either or those times."
"1452500","1456380"," If we get any kind of low tomorrow, any kind of dip, you buy it."
"1457040","1458480"," You run it up right into the bell. "
"1458700","1460880"," You just like diamond hands zero dates into that bell."
"1461640","1462660"," Calls by the way."
"1463860","1468440"," I didn't stutter when I said I was on 441 C's. "
"1468440","1468820"," Did I?"
"1493500","1497760"," I get some air in here."
"1501760","1502660"," So."
"1502660","1502740"," So. "
"1512980","1518280"," Tomorrow you want to pay attention to stuff, right?"
"1518480","1518980"," Then next week."
"1520100","1521100"," Take a breather."
"1521240","1521660"," Take a break. "
"1521900","1525120"," I want you to know that 86% of the time."
"1527420","1528900"," 86% of the time."
"1531000","1533720"," We blast off through 4th of July weekend. "
"1534860","1537420"," Now there's 14% of the time we don't."
"1539720","1542700"," So I would say a couple things to you."
"1543520","1545520"," Long the fuck out of 4th of July. "
"1546260","1549640"," If you're a bear and you're like we doing that."
"1550440","1551640"," I would say sit on your hands."
"1552780","1554560"," If it rolls, you were right. "
"1555780","1560320"," You're likely going to get you have an 86% chance of getting run over."
"1561840","1563040"," So maybe I'd say this."
"1563160","1565040"," If you're a bear, do a ratio spread. "
"1565680","1566440"," You're like fuck that."
"1566580","1567400"," We're selling 4th of July."
"1568080","1568740"," Alright, fuck it. "
"1568800","1569620"," We're selling 4th of July."
"1569840","1570760"," Just do it responsibly."
"1571980","1576300"," Just don't go like full, full, short into the 4th of July weekend, okay?"
"1579760","1581080"," And you'll save yourself. "
"1581080","1585960"," Or at least have some protection or something if you're bearish into the 4th."
"1586560","1587740"," The odds are not in your favor."
"1588100","1590140"," We could sell it, but just be careful. "
"1592080","1593700"," The odds are not in your favor."
"1597220","1599180"," You go long into the 5th."
"1600220","1601580"," Long into the 5th. "
"1604790","1606250"," Now I think that could change."
"1607150","1612450"," I think tomorrow is going to be like I'm interested to see what the collars are coming on the"
"1612450","1612750"," market."
"1612970","1620410"," So that would give me more confidence in that trade going into the 4th. "
"1620530","1623590"," So I think there's like a trade today into tomorrow's open."
"1624870","1627870"," I think there's a hey, let's see what the collar is."
"1628730","1631670"," And then we'll take the rest of the market up or down from there. "
"1633370","1639380"," I think that's like a two or three part trade into the 4th and 5th."
"1661760","1663520"," No, it's not necessarily a bad trade and stuff."
"1664100","1671660"," I want to get you guys the tool because the tool is pretty accurate, right?"
"1672200","1675500"," Like we're like here, this is where the trap is for the bulls, right?"
"1675740","1677160"," They're selling the hourly all the way down. "
"1678640","1681820"," We're seeing the bottoming here."
"1682240","1684120"," We noticed the bottoming going on here."
"1684760","1685860"," Started buying the dips. "
"1686740","1687440"," Buying the dips."
"1687720","1696560"," As a matter of fact, I was in a meeting yesterday and we made a great trade yesterday and then"
"1696560","1700040"," we got caught yesterday in a trade."
"1700280","1702340"," And I was like, yeah, just hold on to these fucking calls. "
"1702420","1704240"," We're going to bounce off this hourly right here."
"1705040","1707840"," And we did just bounce right off it and ripped into the clothes."
"1708080","1710160"," We ended up printing like two or three hundred percent of the bell. "
"1710400","1711620"," Just held right into the bell."
"1712520","1716060"," And we actually took them off at four or three p.m. or something."
"1717200","1718520"," No brainer, easy trade. "
"1719860","1721900"," So we're right back to doing that right now."
"1725460","1730880"," So we're selling the green and buying the green price above it, price below it."
"1731260","1733200"," And we were right down on the daily trigger as well. "
"1733880","1739060"," Already we got very close to it on the twenty third or excuse me, the twenty seventh."
"1740000","1742300"," Started around the corner and come back up higher again."
"1742400","1745000"," Daily trigger still heading higher right now. "
"1747380","1752480"," I had a meeting yesterday with some smart people and I was trying to second meeting."
"1752960","1757480"," We're trying to show proof of concept."
"1758040","1762760"," As a reminder at the bottom of the hour, I'll explain some comments from Bank of England. "
"1763980","1765500"," Of what we're doing."
"1766620","1769420"," Does this like does this give you an edge?"
"1769660","1775240"," It gives the speech at the society of professional economists hosted at a resolution foundation."
"1776940","1778380"," We're making money, baby. "
"1779520","1780860"," You all hot and bother, brother."
"1780960","1782300"," You're making some money today."
"1788680","1789560"," You're making a go, Burr. "
"1795060","1795340"," Baby."
"1858510","1861190"," Three money Thursday, baby."
"1872040","1873440"," Nice. "
"1873440","1875020"," Good job, poke the juice box."
"1884810","1886090"," How's discord doing today?"
"1886290","1887030"," What's going on discord?"
"1889390","1891310"," Check out what's going on discord this morning."
"1893070","1894810"," The guest experience of your daughter was great. "
"1899370","1902650"," So still nice on the comments from Bank of England's 10 Rayra."
"1903790","1905590"," I'm in the discord right now."
"1905590","1912730"," I wonder because they can kind of hear me streaming. "
"1913410","1914770"," So I'm not normally a streamer."
"1914890","1917450"," I didn't do start doing this to become a streamer."
"1917510","1918150"," It wasn't my goal. "
"1919710","1921910"," And I was talking to some friend last night."
"1921970","1927570"," I was like, you know, I was like, when I started this, it was like just a few friends and"
"1927570","1929070"," we're all making money together."
"1929850","1934130"," So the Bank of England have released the comments from Bank of England's 10 Rayra, the link to"
"1934130","1935370"," which is on the feed for those interested. "
"1935990","1940730"," So 10 Rayra says that my vote to leave the bank rate unchanged at my final policy meeting, rested"
"1940730","1943650"," on what the latest data implied about the medium term."
"1944790","1950370"," We're all making money together and we're like watching the outside world and we're going, dude,"
"1950550","1950590"," what?"
"1950590","1955950"," Like, why are all these, like, people, like, they're like long when they should be long shirt when"
"1955950","1959190"," they should be short or not buying dips or not selling reps?"
"1959370","1959910"," Whoever it is, they do."
"1960070","1960550"," It was kind of weird. "
"1961050","1962270"," And that was like the general mantra."
"1964390","1966590"," So I got pissed off."
"1972090","1975790"," People would like to do this, like, they'd say just pure diarist stuff to me. "
"1975850","1978150"," And I'd be like, where are they, where are they eating that shit?"
"1978350","1979370"," Like, where are they drinking this stuff?"
"1981170","1982610"," Like, where are they getting their information?"
"1982950","1985710"," And you're like, of course, they're getting it from someone that's like, get a million followers."
"1986930","1987710"," And I don't know."
"1987770","1989270"," I'm fucking selling some fucking bullshit. "
"1989690","1990650"," Where the fuck it is, they're selling."
"1998510","2000950"," So I was like, I'll make a video, I think."
"2001510","2003330"," So I made a video and I sucked at it. "
"2003950","2006110"," And I didn't get my point across the way that I wanted to either."
"2006110","2006930"," And I was like, this is horrible."
"2008470","2012250"," But then I was doing it with some of these same close friends. "
"2012570","2017110"," And then people popped up like Winky popped up and Joe was supportive and I sucked at it."
"2017150","2018010"," I was still stuck at it."
"2018010","2020470"," But I really sucked at it then. "
"2021570","2022130"," And..."
"2022990","2028070"," Tenreiro says tightening already in the pipeline would be sufficient to bring inflation back to and"
"2028070","2030670"," most likely below the target says Tenreiro."
"2032750","2036870"," I guess my point is they didn't try or I didn't think I would become a streamer over this."
"2038910","2043310"," And that wasn't the hope or the intent now saying all that, right?"
"2043310","2047230"," My daughters have been listening to me in the background for the past couple of years. "
"2048370","2049850"," They can't really hear me."
"2050010","2053989"," I've got a soundproof room that I do this in."
"2055170","2057929"," So they can't really hear me, but they can kind of. "
"2058830","2060350"," And we homeschool."
"2060630","2064969"," So my youngest has been listening to me on and off for two years."
"2064989","2070010"," So I wonder what she's listening to me say, like repeating things. "
"2071489","2076630"," Like when I'm like yelling or something, when the market's like going higher, like right now."
"2078210","2079550"," Like get up there."
"2084880","2086120"," Like get up there. "
"2094500","2095860"," Get up there."
"2100790","2101630"," Hold on a second here."
"2122560","2124400"," My voice is hurting me today. "
"2124500","2127540"," I've got like really bad like Katie and smokers cough."
"2128300","2131220"," More than sufficient to offset the recent data news."
"2150270","2153390"," So I'm going to see if I can get my daughter to scream, get up there for me this morning. "
"2162000","2162960"," Get up there."
"2169110","2170510"," Turn my legs off."
"2170750","2171890"," I just turned my legs back on. "
"2173770","2175650"," I love you."
"2176810","2177430"," All right."
"2178230","2179930"," I pressed the button after reset it. "
"2182830","2184570"," Trading 438 19."
"2188570","2193050"," Testing the sellers from pre-market."
"2194730","2196230"," Find out if they're still there. "
"2196370","2197310"," How strong are they?"
"2197410","2201570"," Members publishing their own views on policy out the way the potential costs."
"2204470","2206410"," Yeah, we should record Maggie's voice."
"2207250","2210010"," I'll write that down like a Maggie sound board. "
"2219090","2224930"," So all along, I didn't know that they're listening in and I'm wondering if they're like, maybe they"
"2224930","2226870"," have like 10 things that they know."
"2229550","2232150"," Like burr baby burr get up there."
"2234130","2234970"," By the dip. "
"2235210","2235550"," I don't know."
"2235770","2237090"," Like I'm going to find out what she knows."
"2238250","2242030"," So I'm going to have to like an interrogator. "
"2242490","2244970"," Like what do you actually know that daddy says repeatedly?"
"2252470","2254390"," I normally don't swear this week."
"2254410","2255290"," I've sworn a lot."
"2256230","2260350"," I don't know why I swore so much this week, but maybe it was like, I don't know. "
"2260410","2261870"," I fell off my bike earlier this week."
"2261990","2263430"," So maybe I just hit my head or something."
"2264250","2265810"," You know, I'll banged up this week. "
"2269590","2275610"," I've been like dancing everywhere every weekend kayaking biking like nonstop playing golf."
"2275910","2276590"," I got my effect."
"2276790","2278110"," I canceled golf yesterday morning. "
"2279290","2283510"," I'm so banged up and I got another golf around the golf schedule for this weekend."
"2283510","2285150"," And I'm like, I don't know if I can do this."
"2285850","2287430"," You're like kayaking golf. "
"2289450","2290950"," We're doing kayaking golf."
"2292630","2294150"," And bike, bike trips."
"2294510","2294910"," I don't know. "
"2295510","2296970"," I'm not going to make it through the weekend."
"2300030","2300830"," Yeah, I don't know."
"2300970","2302830"," I was like cut back on the swearing a ton. "
"2303350","2307050"," And this past week I've just been like, F this and F that and F this."
"2315350","2317290"," Oh, she did say Charlie Puth was great."
"2317870","2318450"," Yeah, we had fun. "
"2318730","2323910"," So we go to Charlie Puth and it was really funny to him getting older."
"2324070","2325050"," So I don't really care anymore."
"2326870","2333630"," But like you have like a lot of adults with their children and the adults are like adulting. "
"2334170","2335490"," They're like, I dressed up."
"2335630","2336350"," I brought my child."
"2336550","2339850"," My child's having fun, but I'm going to sit over here and do nothing. "
"2340830","2342950"," And I'm like, I'm like with my youngest."
"2342950","2344490"," I'm like, you want to go roll down the hill together?"
"2345890","2349830"," So we're like rolling down the hill during the concert or the lead up to the concert and all that"
"2349830","2350070"," stuff."
"2350210","2351970"," And we were then we started dancing together. "
"2353230","2354550"," And I'm like too old now."
"2354890","2357110"," Like having kids when you're older is much more fun."
"2357310","2360310"," You don't care about a lot of stuff when you're older. "
"2360630","2366510"," You're not like, I see like younger parents oftentimes not always, but oftentimes they're like, I'm"
"2366510","2368290"," the responsible adult raising a child."
"2368290","2371090"," And I'm like, it's have some fun raising the child."
"2377270","2386360"," A week is making a note that 1 p.m. is coming. "
"2386780","2387180"," Just saying."
"2387760","2389000"," Yeah, we don't have a lot of time, do we?"
"2389480","2389960"," 1238."
"2390660","2395840"," We know that we usually get that one in the afternoon lunchtime break for Wall Street. "
"2410180","2411500"," What's the price target above?"
"2412160","2413900"," You want to know where my price target is?"
"2419040","2419600"," 447."
"2422400","2425360"," I'd like to personally get 439."
"2426000","2430480"," Let's take a look and see what I would like to hit. "
"2434440","2435480"," Good question."
"2437200","2438840"," What does happy want?"
"2447500","2449580"," I want to close this gap right here."
"2450300","2452020"," At least this gap right here. "
"2452020","2453860"," So that's what I want."
"2453940","2454520"," It's like this."
"2455040","2458200"," I want all that shit erased. "
"2459260","2464640"," What I also want to talk to you about is you can see where you see your prices right now."
"2469550","2471450"," This is the last of the."
"2474250","2475250"," Vol right here. "
"2475250","2476190"," So I want you to see this."
"2476290","2476430"," Okay."
"2477770","2479870"," So this is the last of the volatility, right?"
"2480030","2481050"," So right here, this is a seller. "
"2481990","2483910"," This is a seller, right?"
"2485050","2485990"," That's a seller."
"2486250","2489350"," The next seller is not until up here."
"2490890","2492730"," So there's a giant gap in here. "
"2493590","2494150"," Right?"
"2494330","2501690"," There's a giant gap right in here that needs to be filled and there's no sellers there."
"2501970","2506050"," So my point to you is where you are right now."
"2506050","2506710"," See it. "
"2511290","2512790"," Right where we are right now."
"2514390","2517890"," If we can trade above this 438 19."
"2520450","2522650"," We're going to go like this straight up. "
"2523510","2527590"," And get an explosive move to the upside."
"2528670","2529750"," So there's nothing here."
"2531150","2536830"," The next the next sellers are right here. "
"2537690","2538250"," Sorry."
"2539310","2540150"," Right there."
"2540870","2542690"," That's the next band of selling up here. "
"2543510","2549550"," So this whole area here, we can easily squeeze that and go up."
"2549950","2552410"," So that's my target."
"2553230","2554890"," I know they want to sell this. "
"2555650","2557090"," They came in and did it here."
"2558210","2559670"," They're trying again right here."
"2563820","2565200"," So the sellers are here. "
"2565940","2570940"," How do we know if we're going to squeeze this up here and trade this?"
"2571340","2574860"," Get this big squeeze as long as price stays above the white line."
"2574860","2575440"," We're going up."
"2585000","2587740"," We can also check this red line down here. "
"2587740","2588560"," There's a one minute chart."
"2589240","2590460"," So we can check this down here."
"2590520","2591800"," See the check that we made right here. "
"2618700","2623180"," Where do I take my 441s for tomorrow off?"
"2624600","2627960"," Not unless we break below."
"2628460","2629160"," Right there."
"2630280","2630720"," There. "
"2631880","2632660"," Break below."
"2634140","2637900"," If we get to this point right here, I'll take those 441s off."
"2638720","2642040"," We're going to make our way lower to the hourly trigger unless that happened. "
"2642220","2642920"," I need that to happen."
"2642920","2644540"," I need this part to happen right here."
"2645580","2646420"," Me not to be long. "
"2648580","2649580"," Until then."
"2651020","2652300"," Price target above."
"2659410","2660850"," PT 1."
"2679940","2681180"," PT 2."
"2688670","2689910"," PT 3."
"2690870","2708880"," And I don't think that this is a lot to ask because I don't think"
"2708880","2709940"," this is a lot to ask. "
"2710600","2712160"," And I'll tell you something else."
"2712800","2714700"," Your next sellers are up here."
"2716080","2718420"," So the moment we break above here. "
"2718680","2719200"," 1, 2."
"2720220","2721920"," That's just a squeeze right there."
"2722120","2722320"," Done."
"2730110","2731810"," So this is not hard here. "
"2731970","2732530"," There's not a lot."
"2732750","2733890"," There's no resistance here."
"2734010","2735370"," There's no cell pressure. "
"2736110","2737170"," And when we get above this."
"2737630","2740670"," So we start getting above 438-19."
"2740970","2742530"," We're going to push off all of these sellers. "
"2743710","2745770"," And we're going to have an explosive move to the upside."
"2745770","2747430"," So we're just waiting on it right now."
"2748790","2753670"," I can assure you that right now we break above if we break above 438-19. "
"2754970","2757750"," We are going to rip faces off to the upside here."
"2777090","2778590"," Yeah, I don't think this is a lot to ask."
"2778690","2779850"," We have a lot of time to do it either. "
"2780070","2783390"," We've got today and tomorrow, like today's Thursday, tomorrow's Friday."
"2784790","2786090"," We have a ton of time to do it."
"2786210","2787970"," If we roll it though, if we roll down, no problem. "
"2788290","2791190"," I'll pull the calls off and I'll look for another dip to buy down there."
"2791190","2791690"," They are the trigger."
"2792110","2793010"," It's pretty fucking simple. "
"2793290","2795850"," So it's not hard."
"2804120","2805260"," Hey Stacy, how are you doing?"
"2809790","2814170"," So there's your PTs where we're the expectation for the move."
"2814810","2815970"," And I'd like to see that move. "
"2816210","2818730"," Like if we can get up there, get this move, right?"
"2819830","2821530"," And then do a little bit of a roll down."
"2822670","2827930"," Check this level over here for tomorrow and then take another upside call for Friday."
"2829310","2830130"," Make me happy. "
"2852450","2854610"," What do you guys have for plans over the weekend?"
"2855210","2856930"," Anybody out there have plans for 4th of July?"
"2857710","2859470"," A lot of my friends are not doing a lot."
"2859630","2862950"," A lot of my friends, they're staying home."
"2862950","2865690"," They're telling their barbecue and multiple friends saying that. "
"2865930","2868010"," But they're not doing anything for 4th of July this year."
"2868690","2870210"," It's just all like family stuff."
"2870610","2874810"," Barbecue and watching fireworks on their neighborhoods, stuff like that. "
"2875150","2883930"," I got one friend who's doing a lake party, but no big plans."
"2884370","2886330"," Most of my friends on a big giant major plans."
"2887450","2889270"," Are you making money out there, Winky?"
"2895630","2898630"," Nice paddleboard swimming the Cape with the wife and daughters right on. "
"2900070","2901630"," That sounds like a blast."
"2902290","2903030"," Falmouth fireworks."
"2904530","2905570"," I love the Cape. "
"2907010","2908070"," I love it."
"2908250","2910270"," I grew up hanging out in the Cape all summer."
"2910970","2914050"," I love the Cape. "
"2914370","2917810"," Well, I don't like Dan Tuckett and Martha's Vineyard anymore."
"2918010","2921210"," But I was like the last generation where those places were quiet."
"2921210","2923750"," And they were fucking amazing back in the day. "
"2926210","2927410"," You're in Woods Hole right on."
"2931030","2933530"," Dude, the Berkshires, another good time."
"2936090","2937810"," I love the Berkshires in summer. "
"2938150","2939670"," I was talking to a buddy in New York yesterday."
"2939890","2941930"," I've been talking to a bunch of friends right around the country and stuff."
"2942530","2943770"," Talking to another buddy yesterday. "
"2944710","2945770"," And I'm like, you're getting out of the city."
"2945930","2947950"," And he is like, those are all great things."
"2948350","2952650"," If you're in New York City, right, you take off up to the Catskills or something. "
"2952650","2954050"," Go to the Hamptons."
"2954150","2954930"," Go to Catskills."
"2955330","2956330"," Go catch some theater. "
"2957150","2958350"," An upstate New York."
"2959090","2963350"," If you're in Massachusetts or New Hampshire or something, you head out to like Rye, New Hampshire."
"2963910","2968710"," You get on a Woods Hole or you go to the Cape or you go to the ocean or something"
"2968710","2969170"," like that. "
"2970590","2973070"," Oh, they're telling me to get out right now."
"2973150","2973430"," They angry."
"2974230","2975670"," Are they getting stinky up there?"
"2978750","2979930"," They angry up there. "
"2979930","2981610"," How they don't want us coming up here to say hello."
"2982490","2983310"," You see that?"
"2983450","2984390"," They're like, what are you doing?"
"2984690","2985930"," I'm like, where we're knocking on the door."
"2987990","2988850"," Let us in. "

"2995720","2996360"," Oh, dude."
"2996560","2997780"," Marathon is a blast too. "
"2998000","3000320"," You guys are all doing some great stuff for Fourth of July."
"3001120","3002280"," Like marathon rules."
"3002980","3004200"," Tahoe is you going to go sailing?"
"3004980","3006680"," Like sailing on Lake Tahoe, man. "
"3007260","3008680"," Hanging out with the boys from."
"3009860","3010300"," What's that?"

"3011700","3012580"," Is it Brian?"
"3012920","3013560"," What's he from?"
"3013780","3014140"," Delos?"

"3021740","3022940"," The Cape Cod for the weekend?"
"3023220","3023440"," Right on."
"3023560","3023780"," Right on. "
"3025280","3025640"," Yeah."
"3025800","3027480"," You're worried about the smoke will be around for the fourth."
"3027860","3028940"," That's what my problem is. "
"3029000","3029700"," I'm like, how am I going to?"
"3029920","3032140"," We've got like thunderstorms coming every night."
"3033200","3035500"," And we've got this is kind of funny."
"3038380","3040680"," I've got an I've got a like I took a."
"3042260","3043320"," That's not really an RV. "
"3043540","3044780"," It took a pop up camper."
"3045260","3047720"," And I turned it into like an expedition camper."
"3047800","3050480"," So I take it on like a big bike trips and stuff like that. "
"3051300","3053000"," And I'll make like a base camp with it."
"3054380","3058240"," I got rid of my tent when I moved from the west to the east."
"3058660","3061600"," I had this kick ass Kodiak tent canvas spring bar tent. "
"3062220","3062800"," Pops right up."
"3062800","3068220"," I used that thing when I was out in places with like grizzly country and stuff."
"3069060","3070140"," I got West man. "
"3070240","3070860"," Shit's different."
"3071320","3072020"," Hits different."
"3072320","3074220"," Like you got things that'll kill you. "
"3074400","3077100"," You've got big thunderstorms that'll kill you."
"3077100","3079320"," You got boulders rolling down."
"3079620","3080520"," So like everything is bigger. "
"3081860","3083220"," And so I got rid of it."
"3083300","3084440"," So I bought a tent recently."
"3085940","3087360"," And I was like, you know what?"
"3087520","3088380"," This trip we're going to take. "
"3089220","3091400"," We got a trip coming up on June."
"3091400","3094060"," June 30 or let me see June."
"3094340","3095000"," Take a look. "
"3095100","3095840"," Not June July."
"3096720","3098500"," We've got a trip coming up in July."
"3100860","3104240"," I think it's the 28th until the third. "
"3105480","3107000"," And so I'm talking to my wife."
"3107200","3108280"," I'm like, it's going to rain this weekend."
"3108280","3111580"," And I'm like, dude, if we were tent camping, you'd be pissed. "
"3111800","3112100"," Wouldn't you?"
"3112900","3117340"," And she's like, what are we going to do if it rains during our trip?"
"3117560","3119300"," Because we're taking this big trip next month."
"3119300","3123780"," And I'm like, you know, I have to make this tent bomb proof."
"3124740","3128800"," So this past week, I've been waterproofing it. "
"3129680","3132360"," And I think I'm going to do one more coat."
"3132720","3140520"," I did spray on waterproofing, but I did the seams with like a blend of mineral spirits in silicone."
"3140520","3144200"," But I think I'm going to make a spray of silicone spray the entire thing down. "
"3144600","3146760"," And it's supposed to rain this entire weekend."
"3146760","3150260"," And I'm like, is it going to rain with smoke during my next trip as well?"
"3151280","3155580"," So I'm a little fearful here if I'm doing the right thing, even planning a trip with a tent."
"3164720","3165980"," Hey, you guys want to see Tesla?"
"3169220","3170020"," What do I think?"
"3170320","3170540"," I don't know. "
"3170660","3174860"," Right now I bought 4.41 C's for 22 cents."
"3175260","3177560"," They're trading 45, 46 right now."
"3180120","3182480"," 4.42's. I think they print. "
"3183680","3185500"," I'm already up 100% or something."
"3185760","3188420"," So if I can get 200 or 300% I'll be happy."
"3188880","3189620"," I don't know if I will though. "
"3190840","3193620"," I would really like to do this today and take the money."
"3194340","3196020"," I'd really like to like take that money."
"3197200","3199760"," And then re-enter a new trade into the clothes, something like this. "
"3199900","3200460"," We'll show it to you guys."
"3208200","3209620"," And really, I don't know that we do."
"3211320","3213320"," If you didn't know, there's a bunch of sellers here. "
"3214440","3215180"," And they're angry."
"3215420","3216080"," They don't want us passing."
"3217800","3219020"," They're all angry over here. "
"3219120","3220480"," They're like, you will not pass."
"3222440","3224260"," You can't have the gap up here."
"3224520","3226820"," Now if we do get the gap, we trade this. "
"3229160","3231100"," We're going to close this stuff out."
"3231240","3232420"," We're going to close that stuff out."
"3232520","3233700"," We're going to close that stuff out. "
"3233700","3243610"," If we can close this today, I would"
"3243610","3245710"," like to take the money off the trade."
"3247190","3249090"," And then look for a dip to buy for tomorrow."
"3251190","3253850"," I don't know if we can close this today, all this stuff. "
"3255610","3258710"," They're going to attempt to not allow us to close this today."
"3259070","3259510"," I already know that."
"3260330","3265050"," So I've got this zone here to stay long. "
"3266830","3271470"," And as long as we stay above it, I'm long for this stuff above."
"3271850","3273290"," And not unless they sell it."
"3273530","3276150"," And will I take the long off?"
"3278090","3281150"," Now if they do sell it here, there's an hourly trigger down here we can buy. "
"3282350","3283910"," I'll tell you guys where that is right now."
"3284010","3285350"," We're going to look at Tesla here in just a minute too."
"3290420","3292220"," 4.36 and some change. "
"3306750","3312170"," It smells like a, it smells like a, it smells really bad here."
"3314230","3315310"," That's right down here."
"3319970","3321670"," So there's the HT right there. "
"3323990","3325590"," I'm perfectly fine with the sell."
"3325690","3326450"," Can we sell this here?"
"3327930","3328990"," Start selling this."
"3329210","3331570"," I'll buy this once again for another trip higher tomorrow. "
"3331710","3333750"," So we got this trade here."
"3337150","3339130"," We got this by the fucking dip here."
"3343340","3351570"," We've got this breakout above to close that. "
"3351770","3355330"," Come back down for trade higher tomorrow."
"3357250","3358670"," Much different options here."
"3364530","3375130"," Go in"
"3375130","3376590"," it when it rains before the trip tests. "
"3376590","3380590"," Yeah, I did the, so I did the seams."
"3381470","3382790"," And then I sprayed it."
"3383450","3385550"," And I left it out in rain this week. "
"3387370","3389610"," I didn't, you know I fucked up."
"3389710","3391090"," I didn't, I didn't just take it down."
"3391570","3393770"," And it almost flew away when I got home earlier in the week. "
"3394490","3396390"," We had a couple of dry days, so I took it down."
"3396730","3402830"," But I think I'm going to put it back up through this weekend and spray it."
"3402830","3405350"," I'm going to take mineral spirits and get it really thin. "
"3406590","3411090"," The silicone really thin and spray it down and make it like a bomb proof winter tent."
"3411850","3414890"," You know, another thing that I did was I, it's got, it's a three season tent."
"3414950","3418450"," So it's got the air gap with the, with the mesh on the top. "
"3419490","3427670"," So I cut out a plastic, what's that stuff?"
"3427670","3429170"," The, like the blue tarp."
"3429370","3430590"," I cut that stuff out."
"3432030","3434770"," And I attached some Velcro. "
"3436010","3440470"," So I can make it a four season tent if I need to."
"3440890","3442770"," A single walled four season tent."
"3444050","3447210"," If it ever gets cold or anything, it's like for fall camping. "
"3448330","3450250"," I'm going to, I want to take a trip this fall."
"3451010","3455390"," I want to go up and do a backcountry trip up in a porcupine mountains I think."
"3455390","3456370"," Something like that. "
"3456890","3457710"," A little nowhere."
"3461420","3462520"," Hey buddy, how are you doing?"
"3481900","3485880"," Yeah, I was, I used to live in Park City for a long time."
"3486380","3487840"," And we had wildfires. "
"3489520","3491920"," That were insane, right?"
"3492580","3497660"," They would be like the sky would be orange, red orange."
"3498500","3501360"," And then you'd get rained on with ash."
"3502600","3503140"," It was pretty wild. "
"3503140","3507840"," And then the, we'd have airplanes fly over right over my house."
"3507840","3512460"," Like these giant airplanes would be like, like a few hundred feet right over your head."
"3512600","3513300"," Like woof. "
"3514040","3517480"," And then you'd see him like cross over to the next valley and just dump."
"3519080","3519560"," Water."
"3520360","3521300"," It's pretty wild. "
"3524400","3530460"," Yeah, Park City was, um, Park City for a few years had some, some crazy wildfires, dangerous ones."
"3536700","3539480"," No, I would say maybe not as dangerous as California, of course."
"3540480","3541300"," California, man. "
"3541560","3542660"," I lived in California too."
"3542760","3543980"," I'd go up to the mountains of California."
"3545340","3548840"," And you go up there and you'd be like, shit, this is a whole, this is like just one giant"
"3548840","3549860"," tinderbox up here. "
"3553720","3555560"," Just one huge tinderbox."
"3558200","3562880"," Like some of the California mountains, you're just like, this whole place is like, it's like one"
"3562880","3563860"," match will set it off."
"3564320","3569280"," What's crazy too, is you'd have some of these fires start is catalytic converters. "
"3570160","3576560"," So like you'll take your four by four vehicle out to, you'll take your four by four vehicle out to"
"3576560","3578100"," the mountains or some, right?"
"3578780","3582180"," And you're, you'll park off the side of the four by four track."
"3583200","3588180"," And you've got, um, you've got, uh, like grass and stuff."
"3589140","3592860"," That will, um, that'll like catch fire and you're not paying attention. "
"3592960","3597400"," You go off and start hiking and you come back and like three acres are burning."
"3598820","3601880"," Oh, look at the sellers here."
"3602300","3603900"," Rage from the south side right now. "
"3605260","3606660"," They're all cranky right here."
"3606760","3608000"," We had this happen yesterday."
"3609100","3613340"," So yesterday we were sitting in some calls and we knew that the sellers were here. "
"3614180","3616060"," And we were like, here, the seller is going to command."
"3616060","3618000"," They're going to get all cranky, try to throw us over."
"3618500","3620300"," They're all stinky, stinky bears. "
"3620540","3621300"," They don't want us going up."
"3623280","3624480"," All kinds of drama."
"3627760","3631080"," They're all cranky pants diapers are full. "
"3636360","3641060"," It was really fascinating too, because when we were here yesterday, uh, say we're like similar"
"3641060","3641860"," situation, right?"
"3642320","3644620"," Uh, my buddy was going to sell and I was like, no, you don't sell."
"3646060","3647720"," I was like, what you can do is wait till you get up here."
"3649640","3651700"," So the confirmation of the move lower. "
"3652840","3654380"," You take your profit right there."
"3655480","3656740"," If you think that we're going to roll."
"3657480","3659820"," If you, if your idea is that we're going to roll, that's what you do. "
"3661260","3664600"," So you never take like you never panic sell this bar right here."
"3671160","3672120"," So saucy bears."
"3672860","3685700"," Uh, Norcal"
"3685700","3688240"," one spark equals conflagration. "
"3688500","3689160"," Yeah, man."
"3689840","3691660"," That's the fucking lutely."
"3694160","3694960"," Absolutely. "
"3702050","3703910"," Yeah, it's good to be here making money."
"3706150","3709250"," So much rage, south side rage, man."
"3709830","3710290"," Oof. "
"3711690","3718150"," Singapore's that CME group are to launch ether and Bitcoin ratio futures on July the 31st."
"3718290","3723290"," So that's a CME group to launch ether, Bitcoin ratio futures on July 31st."
"3727210","3728190"," Am I making money?"
"3728490","3729470"," I'm making tons of fucking money. "
"3730410","3740230"," I mean, uh, four forty one C's for twenty two cents."
"3740890","3747490"," And, uh, we were did a presentation in the morning and we lasted until I think one thirty in the"
"3747490","3747750"," afternoon."
"3748650","3750650"," And we were in a room with a bunch of smart people. "
"3750830","3755950"," And the neatest part of it was that, um, the neatest part of yesterday was."
"3756970","3760150"," That it wasn't like we planned or set up."
"3760830","3764070"," A specific time of day or a day to make money. "
"3765150","3771010"," So we can kind of like set this up to where, hey, we know on this day we'll likely have"
"3771010","3771630"," a trend day."
"3773210","3775410"," And we can probably give a presentation."
"3776730","3778310"," That'll make us look awesome. "
"3779450","3780350"," We didn't do that."
"3780490","3781390"," We're just like, you know what?"
"3782130","3783710"," Uh, it doesn't fucking matter when we do it."
"3784270","3788610"," We can do it 11 a.m., 9 a.m., 1 p.m., 3 p.m. We can do it"
"3788610","3789350"," tomorrow today. "
"3790330","3791430"," We can do it a sideways day."
"3791630","3792550"," We can do it a down day."
"3792650","3793230"," It doesn't matter. "
"3794190","3798190"," So we went to this presentation yesterday and, uh, you know what?"
"3798430","3801090"," We got done whenever we got done and I was like, you wanted to take some trades?"
"3802090","3803490"," And these guys were like, sure."
"3803830","3809430"," So we took some trades together and we're just trying to do proof of concept and it was fucking"
"3809430","3809790"," phenomenal."
"3811610","3816470"," As a matter of fact, I'm not going to say who, but one of the guys in the room. "
"3818250","3821530"," I tell these guys, I was like, don't close this stuff."
"3821630","3822250"," Just let it ride."
"3822250","3828310"," And so they let it ride and, um, one of the guys did not. "
"3829330","3831370"," One of the guys was like, uh, right?"
"3831550","3832930"," He was like, we were like right here."
"3833510","3835210"," I think it was our second or third trade."
"3835790","3839190"," So we made like six, I think it was six total trades. "
"3841190","3843290"," And, uh, it was like six trades."
"3844650","3849110"," Uh, we traded GME Spy and IWM multiple times."
"3851010","3854330"," And there was a trade where we got rolled over on the trade. "
"3855190","3857350"," But our timing was right and we were good, right?"
"3858550","3861430"," So we were, we were like rolling down or something."
"3862030","3863210"," It was like right here, I'll show it to you."
"3868590","3871070"," It was, uh, we took a trade yesterday. "
"3872150","3873630"," I think right here."
"3875830","3877670"," And we got caught in it, right?"
"3877670","3884140"," I think we were, this is what, this is exactly how we'll go."
"3884440","3885360"," We're coming up here, right?"
"3885740","3890380"," Coming up here yesterday and I'm talking to these guys and I'm like, yeah, I just want to get a"
"3890380","3892340"," dip by like, I just want a cheap price. "
"3893540","3897680"," So we bought like right here, boom, came up and failed."
"3900020","3903740"," And I'm like, you know what, just leave those fucking, I'm like, just leave those fucking calls on."
"3903940","3907860"," We tagged the hourly trigger and we're going to hold this. "
"3908980","3911160"," And everybody held except for one guy."
"3912560","3915880"," And so we're, we go back to the presentation yesterday."
"3917340","3921420"," And we've got this, we've got this chart up on the, on a big screen. "
"3922160","3925760"," And it's just in the background and I'm just blabbing away, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab, blab,"
"3925920","3926240"," blab, blab."
"3927520","3934340"," It's our questions and talking and as I'm doing that, like this is happening right here and this is"
"3934340","3934800"," happening."
"3935440","3936920"," And people are watching in the background. "
"3939220","3942180"," And this looks like it's going to fail into the belly yesterday, right?"
"3943400","3945260"," So I'm wrapping up the presentation."
"3945780","3947620"," It's like four o'clock or not four."
"3947740","3948500"," It's like 358. "
"3949860","3952060"," And then we just start exploding to the upside."
"3953220","3959680"," And all of our calls went to 300% into the bell."
"3960860","3966160"," And so it was like 401, 402 and I'm like, okay, close your calls. "
"3968940","3971460"," So like people are closing their calls, right?"
"3971820","3981780"," As we go into the bell and as they're closing their calls, as they're closing their"
"3981780","3985480"," calls, one guy goes, I sold."
"3986820","3988140"," And I was like, what do you mean you sold?"
"3990820","3992800"," And they go, they go, I sold."
"3993820","3995040"," They go, what do you mean you sold?"
"3996160","3998240"," And he sold like this down here. "
"3999880","4001960"," He sold this bar right here."
"4003280","4004600"," The great down there."
"4005800","4011960"," As soon as he bounced on that hourly boom, that was it, he was out. "
"4014000","4015980"," So it actually helped the presentation."
"4019300","4025920"," It actually helped the presentation to have that proof of concept through to the end."
"4037490","4038890"," Oh, look at that down there. "
"4039010","4039750"," Oh, so much doom."
"4046100","4047600"," So much doom and gloom."
"4053080","4055620"," 436, 36-ish. "
"4059780","4061020"," It's right here."
"4063380","4064640"," It's right down there."
"4076440","4077420"," I'm gonna add more. "
"4077560","4077960"," Hold on here."
"4089500","4090480"," Am I still in calls?"
"4090720","4090800"," Yes."
"4091100","4092240"," I'm still in calls right now. "
"4092240","4096899"," I'm looking on the markets here, S&P 500 pairing gains, up around spot 1% on the session so"
"4096899","4100300"," far, according to the DICC up around spot 3%."
"4100300","4101300"," I think so."
"4101399","4106260"," I've got a 341 C's, but I got in down here. "
"4106500","4110580"," So I got in right on this bar right here."
"4111100","4112680"," This is where Capibot right down here."
"4119450","4120510"," Yeah, still in calls. "
"4120830","4122130"," Matter of fact, just added another 100 packs."
"4124689","4125910"," I'm building a position."
"4130830","4132050"," No, I've got Fridays. "
"4133090","4134510"," I've been in them since this morning."
"4138609","4139529"," I have 400."
"4157970","4159569"," The reaction was great. "
"4159910","4161210"," So that's the last part of it."
"4161470","4165010"," So the reaction was unreal."
"4165010","4167170"," The reaction was well taken, well received. "
"4167569","4169069"," It is this kind of stuff where like."
"4171310","4173109"," You have to have an edge, right?"
"4173470","4175010"," You can't be like."
"4177350","4180430"," Well, number one, I don't want to be like a furu, right?"
"4183210","4186470"," You know, like, so the idea here is that. "
"4189210","4192130"," The idea here is that I either turn into a furu."
"4193410","4194710"," We shut this down."
"4196890","4198250"," And I move along my way. "
"4198570","4201170"," I don't want to be a furu and I don't want to shut it down."
"4201850","4203290"," I like helping out retailers."
"4204010","4205530"," I like the feeling that it gives me is. "
"4206470","4207670"," Makes me feel good inside."
"4209290","4211130"," But you have to have an edge and."
"4212290","4215030"," So if you're not going to be a furu and you're not going to shut it down, you have to"
"4215030","4215970"," have a fucking edge. "
"4217650","4218570"," It's not for me."
"4218630","4219070"," It's not good."
"4219830","4222930"," There's some services out there where they'll have their own tools or. "
"4223310","4224770"," We do this or we do that or."
"4225430","4226210"," We do gamma."
"4227130","4228090"," We do gax. "
"4228310","4229950"," We do whatever the fuck it is you do."
"4231170","4234130"," And some of those things I'm like, ah, that's not an edge."
"4234650","4235490"," It's like more like awareness. "
"4237290","4238610"," I need a fucking edge."
"4240550","4242730"," As a retailer, we don't get an edge, right?"
"4242950","4243790"," As a retailer, we get."
"4246470","4248570"," Crystal balls, tea leaves. "
"4249870","4251210"," We don't get a lot, right?"
"4251670","4253190"," As a retail, we get a lot of like."
"4255110","4256110"," Sometimes it works."
"4256430","4257470"," Sometimes it doesn't. "
"4257910","4258930"," We get a lot of stuff."
"4259150","4262490"," That's like we get people that sell shit and we're like, what the fuck do they say?"
"4262590","4263330"," What are they saying to us?"
"4264430","4267210"," I was highlighting in this meeting yesterday a guy that."
"4268270","4272450"," He puts out a brief every day in the morning and at night time and. "
"4272450","4274650"," He writes this brief in a way."
"4277450","4279170"," Where he has an out."
"4280550","4281650"," No matter what. "
"4283250","4286390"," He'll give like the bull case, the bear case and the theta case."
"4287030","4292250"," And he crafts and weaves it so perfectly that it doesn't matter the outcome."
"4294090","4296430"," So if we go up, he's right. "
"4296870","4298250"," If we go down, he's right."
"4298990","4299430"," We trade sideways."
"4299950","4300190"," He's right. "
"4301150","4302510"," And it doesn't help."
"4305830","4308490"," So, it's fascinating because people love it."
"4309230","4311190"," They're like, that guy's smart. "
"4312830","4316250"," Like this guy is writing this specifically a certain way."
"4317850","4318750"," For consumption."
"4319710","4322550"," For you to consume and not have an edge. "
"4323990","4325910"," I think that's what we're all looking for as an edge, right?"
"4326610","4328170"," Not easy to have an edge."
"4329150","4332510"," So it's a very, very hard thing to do."
"4332990","4335130"," It's not, it's not easy. "
"4336690","4337470"," Having an edge."
"4337690","4339110"," It's a fucking hard thing to do."
"4342910","4343290"," So. "
"4346450","4347850"," You want to have an edge."
"4347910","4348410"," You want to have."
"4348930","4351310"," If you're not going to be a furu, you're not going to shut it down. "
"4353050","4357370"," You got to have a fucking edge and you have to be able to get that edge to people."
"4357630","4358370"," You have to be like here."
"4358370","4359210"," I have an edge. "
"4359410","4359810"," Do you want it?"
"4360210","4361830"," And if they're like, fuck yeah, I want that edge."
"4364550","4366510"," We can continue on with what we're doing."
"4366770","4367930"," And we can make it self sustainable. "
"4368430","4373250"," And we can have the community help with that development of having an edge."
"4373990","4378210"," So if you have a large community that says, hey man, we're all doing the same thing."
"4379070","4380010"," I see something. "
"4380610","4381430"," Are you seeing this?"
"4381850","4382590"," Do you see something?"
"4383550","4386050"," And if we're all on the same page with that edge."
"4386730","4389550"," We can be a force to be reckoned with, right?"
"4390170","4390690"," As a community."
"4392270","4396170"," We will scare the shit out of the big boys. "
"4398130","4399190"," Because we have an edge."
"4405110","4407170"," So that's what we're doing right now is."
"4409210","4411970"," Or we started with working on this in the background. "
"4412270","4416190"," Like Winky and I are doing this in the background with some other people."
"4416670","4424910"," And then now it's time to show people that haven't had any, had any experience with this."
"4425290","4426850"," Very smart people and say here, this is we got. "
"4428110","4429850"," Do you think that we have an edge."
"4432210","4434630"," And it's been a multiple meetings."
"4435790","4437370"," To try to prove this stuff. "
"4439010","4440530"," And we've been proving it."
"4440810","4442670"," So if we have an edge."
"4445630","4446670"," That's provable. "
"4448270","4449430"," That's a big fucking deal."
"4451850","4453190"," Pretty big fucking deal."
"4453570","4456330"," So that's what we're doing right now. "
"4456430","4457590"," So it's been going on past week."
"4475340","4478220"," Any thoughts about preventing banks from taking away your edge."
"4478360","4480400"," That's a big conversation that we had yesterday. "
"4481420","4484320"," So a large conversation that we had yesterday."
"4484920","4485900"," We don't know."
"4486200","4491560"," I think the thought process here is that that's a big question that we had to answer. "
"4492060","4492500"," We're discussing."
"4494600","4497660"," We can't we fuck this is a hard one."
"4500820","4501860"," We cannot. "
"4505020","4508460"," Some of what we're doing we can't release publicly ever."
"4509820","4511220"," Or we'll lose the edge."
"4512080","4515440"," So there has to be it has to be more of an educational thing. "
"4516140","4518580"," And kind of like you have to work hard to get there."
"4519120","4521600"," So that you can weed out a lot of people."
"4523540","4525900"," So if you if you make it just obscure enough. "
"4527200","4529360"," Where you have to work hard to figure it out."
"4530400","4533040"," Then hopefully will this kind of weird thing to say."
"4534340","4536000"," This is going to sound really crazy. "
"4538300","4539620"," Less people is better."
"4542700","4544600"," So we need to make it less people."
"4547260","4548200"," It's kind of crazy. "
"4550040","4554120"," So we think that we do think that the group is going to be small."
"4554940","4556900"," We're not trying to tell everybody."
"4559380","4564680"," We're going to make it a hard work for the user to use it. "
"4565200","4566320"," We have to we don't have a choice."
"4568440","4571220"," Because I think the banks will try to beat it to agree with you."
"4571540","4572440"," Who said that out there. "
"4573140","4573920"," Who said that."
"4575940","4578160"," Who said someone out someone's very smart out there."
"4581180","4582460"," We can look mobile. "
"4582740","4583060"," Yeah, man."
"4585800","4587240"," There's an aspect to that man."
"4588240","4588620"," Absolutely. "
"4589300","4591540"," The results of the fed reverse repoporation."
"4594160","4599680"," So I've been in four forty ones since twenty two cents for forty ones."
"4600360","4605120"," And I just added another pack right here. "
"4615310","4618950"," Yeah, there's there's we so it's really weird."
"4619110","4623050"," So we've built this thing out to a point where it's possible."
"4624830","4626670"," To remove all the work. "
"4627290","4629150"," And just have the best setups."
"4629950","4635150"," One hundred and two counter parties take one spot nine three five trillion dollars at the fed"
"4635150","4635830"," reverse repoporation."
"4636770","4639970"," We don't think that we'll ever release that. "
"4640490","4643890"," We had a bunch of talk about this like how much do you charge."
"4644970","4647690"," We went like through circular conversations."
"4649590","4651550"," Like it became absurd. "
"4652030","4654090"," It was like yeah, what about ten thousand a month."
"4654730","4656970"," Like twenty thousand to limit."
"4658250","4661770"," Like for the for like the best version of this tool hundred thousand. "
"4665010","4665710"," What's the price."
"4667710","4671190"," Because I don't even know that the crazy part is you're likely to get shut down."
"4671190","4672110"," Like you're going to get threatened. "
"4672110","4673190"," You're going to get sued."
"4673530","4674010"," You're going to get."
"4675370","4676530"," Attract unwanted attention. "
"4676850","4678670"," You're going to get bought out all kinds of stupid shit."
"4678690","4683290"," So I think that there's like this whole like risk."
"4685330","4685650"," Associated. "
"4686810","4688950"," So it has to be like just a little bit of an edge."
"4688950","4690410"," Not a ton of edge."
"4691250","4691570"," So. "
"4699840","4704460"," Not really like the really weird stuff is that I've got like ten people right now that I do that"
"4704460","4705020"," to pay that."
"4705860","4709040"," Like I've got people in the background that are like just shut the whole thing down and we'll trade"
"4709040","4709380"," it together."
"4710120","4711200"," They've already been trading it with me. "
"4712200","4713440"," So it's like that simple."
"4714660","4715780"," I don't have to deliver to anybody."
"4715980","4716560"," It's already been delivered. "
"4716860","4717720"," Like the people are already here."
"4718820","4722200"," There's a very small group of people here that will just shut the whole fucking thing down and"
"4722200","4723040"," trade it together alone."
"4723560","4724420"," It's that fucking good. "
"4724800","4727640"," So that's the fear."
"4728120","4730360"," So that's where we're at with I can't release it publicly ever."
"4731000","4736540"," I think that's the thought here is I think that conclusion at this point is that version will never"
"4736540","4737680"," see the light of day ever. "
"4739940","4741880"," I think that's where we're at with a lot of it."
"4742380","4748060"," So it has to become something where it's like it's kind of like here's a ten page paper."
"4750420","4757080"," It's controlled what you can see and then it gets you gets disseminated to you when or you have to"
"4757080","4758560"," like work hard to figure it out. "
"4758980","4761200"," So it has to be something like that I think."
"4761460","4762540"," Application with the SEC."
"4765220","4768240"," You guys all you guys all short as fuck or what. "
"4771960","4777700"," You guys all selling the market right now."
"4779140","4781900"," You guys all take profit right here in this bottom tick."
"4782500","4785300"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market. "
"4785300","4788960"," By signing out to the tick dot com."
"4805730","4808010"," We went through that process we went."
"4812050","4814770"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, young trader that's where we're at right now. "
"4815370","4818870"," We're at the we're so we've literally come full circle."
"4819110","4823590"," It's like the are these all these arguments like we've gone around in circles for like a two months"
"4823590","4825510"," and as the months of past."
"4827090","4831630"," As the months of past for now I'll tell you exactly where we are right now right now we're at. "
"4834350","4839590"," You have to work for it like everybody has to work for it because when it does it's going to"
"4839590","4841150"," dissuade well a few things."
"4842010","4845530"," A new trainer likely won't understand it which is good."
"4847310","4850930"," So you you likely have to have time and market to understand it. "
"4851970","4854870"," And you likely have to work to get the results."
"4855270","4858370"," So it pushes off a whole large group of people."
"4858750","4862190"," It like keeps people away from us which is kind of good. "
"4863770","4871050"," Believe it or not."
"4872190","4877790"," If we break this shit or if they get pissed off at us it's gonna be fucking gone and then"
"4877790","4878150"," we're fucked."
"4878570","4882530"," So let's run the gravy train as long as we possibly can. "
"4888890","4890670"," We don't want new followers."
"4891050","4896990"," I'm serious like our conversation ended yesterday with we probably don't want any more followers."
"4899690","4900690"," Like this we got plenty. "
"4904130","4907030"," Some dead serious is really fucking bizarre man."
"4911790","4913290"," Yeah exactly exactly."
"4917100","4921700"," Now did you guys are all here we're just not going to be we're not going to be like we're"
"4921700","4923460"," not going to we're not going to do a big splash. "
"4924640","4931360"," So as a matter of fact I was talking a close friend yesterday and he has a discord."
"4933680","4935560"," And he's like we shut ours down."
"4936560","4940880"," I was like you did what he's like we shut our discord down and I was like why he's like"
"4940880","4942260"," it's too fucking big. "
"4942680","4946180"," And I was like really like yeah dude he's like just stop I was like."
"4947320","4952420"," And he was because I was making our case but asking him I was like hey man like."
"4954460","4959020"," Because I think we have to limit all this shit and he was like we did that ourselves and I"
"4959020","4961220"," was like why like explain why. "
"4963280","4966120"," And it's just sometimes it's better to be under the radar."
"4967660","4969980"," So it's just better sometimes to be under the radar."
"4978110","4982450"," It'll be sad one day when I log in and all the CJ just got him deleted. "
"4984350","4985510"," Yeah they're watching dude."
"4985790","4988110"," I think they are watching 100% I think they're watching."
"4988770","4990310"," I think at some point we go dark. "
"4990930","4996030"," Like I'm going to be fucking serious like I think at some point it's like get in here get in"
"4996030","4996590"," here get in here."
"4996690","4998470"," And then we're just like boom shut up fucking Twitter."
"4999430","5002590"," Make the discord fucking fucking close discord. "
"5002590","5007250"," And then we're just doing like videos to to close members and that's it."
"5007250","5009990"," And no new new new members like that's it's just us."
"5013790","5015030"," Something like that. "
"5017990","5021610"," I can be wrong here but I think that could possibly be where we're headed."
"5021950","5028130"," So you know like your video like the videos live streams will just be you and us."
"5028130","5032190"," That's it I'll open the stream chat back up there be like a thousand of us. "
"5033590","5034850"," And it's just us."
"5039970","5042370"," Yeah man just and just exit social media."
"5051380","5055240"," Now we're rolling it out right now it's we're we're working on it right now so. "
"5056500","5060300"," It's just a bigger process it's a bigger process than I thought it would be."
"5061280","5065260"," It's more complicated than I thought it would be and we're doing it the right way."
"5067780","5070660"," It sucks doing it the right way it's not fun. "
"5073060","5078520"," We even brought in a startup guy that has experience with startups because."
"5079980","5082100"," We don't want it to be like the janky."
"5083560","5086780"," Well there's a bunch of stuff here like dude I can tell you guys some shit like. "
"5087520","5092200"," If you're a if you do this kind of stuff right a lot of guys out there women doesn't matter."
"5092640","5099420"," They get trapped in like the Twitter garden or the stock to it garden or the YouTube garden or the"
"5099420","5099980"," Twitch garden."
"5100980","5105600"," It doesn't matter like they're like you'll get like hey I'm on sub stack. "
"5106300","5110920"," And I'm on patreon and I have most of my most of my audiences on Twitter."
"5111460","5118000"," So like if you ever get so you're always beholden to any lawn musk."
"5118600","5125220"," You're always beholden to a garden right someone's garden somebody else's garden. "
"5127240","5131460"," And if you ever canceled if you ever shut off if you're ever denied."
"5132520","5137300"," If you ever if you ever do anything wrong at all at any point all your content is in these"
"5137300","5137620"," places."
"5138340","5142720"," And if they ever take it away from you you're fucked. "
"5144160","5147820"," If they ever change the rules for you you're fucked."
"5149320","5151420"," They can dictate everything to you."
"5151580","5152780"," They can dictate anything they want. "
"5153680","5154300"," They're cut."
"5155560","5158220"," They can decide one day if people are going to see you or not."
"5158680","5161480"," They can YouTube famously. "
"5162820","5168400"," You'll see content makers will be like hey I don't know why but nobody's watching my videos"
"5168400","5168760"," anymore."
"5169100","5173860"," There's this guy he's from Canada he's a he's a construction guy I forget his name right now Leslie"
"5173860","5174560"," or something."
"5175280","5182720"," And he used to have like 300,000 people watching his construction videos and I was checking him"
"5182720","5183880"," with him on a Saturday or something. "
"5184400","5187940"," He made a video and he was like YouTube just stopped pushing my videos."
"5188580","5192180"," Like I went from like 300,000 views a day to like 10,000."
"5192820","5196640"," Because I got to know why they did this maybe other people are doing different content or new"
"5196640","5197800"," content or. "
"5198480","5203500"," Because I'm not covering stuff that new construction guys are covering I don't know what's going on"
"5203500","5208560"," say any moment if you don't have your own garden you can lose all your shit."
"5209620","5210620"," For any reason."
"5212060","5216180"," So of course we're like well we don't want to build it like that we don't want to get we"
"5216180","5216780"," want our own garden. "
"5217940","5222900"," We need our own garden we have to have our own garden we can't have a can't be under the"
"5222900","5223680"," thumb of anybody."
"5226860","5231300"," So have your own garden is like it's not fucking easy it is like a ton of work."
"5233040","5238740"," So that so that you're the you have the control over your future. "
"5239460","5243280"," I take the cost a lot of money a lot of time plus smart people have to be involved."
"5245220","5254060"," Just a quick note from analysts Wall Street got more signs the federal reserves war against"
"5254060","5259100"," inflation isn't breaking the economy or at least not yet with traders sending treasury yields"
"5259100","5261360"," soaring amid bets on further tightening."
"5261920","5267700"," Yeah, that's what I think I think there's a you have like the Wall Street bet movement you've got"
"5267700","5273740"," back in the day you had the Yahoo message boards that was a movement right 2000s early 2000s. "
"5273740","5279860"," That all grew into Wall Street bets right you've got and you've got the Twitter fin twit thing that"
"5279860","5281140"," happened for a bunch of years."
"5281140","5284220"," You like stock twitch jumped and you got roaring kitty out there."

"5310540","5317840"," There's there's a major war going on right now behind the scenes of the control of information. "
"5322360","5329120"," Like so so like who's deciding what the information is good if it's bad if it's real if it's fake."
"5332280","5337240"," And then and then and then and then the monetization of that that content right."
"5337940","5342820"," And a lot of this has to do with the retailers out there used to be a there used to"
"5342820","5348060"," be the Wild West right you should see the shit that went on and Yahoo message boards back in the"

"5617640","5620380"," I think they know the flows that are coming through tomorrow."
"5621860","5625640"," I don't think they want to get caught inside of those flows coming in tomorrow."
"5626440","5627140"," That's what I think. "
"5628260","5631260"," I think I'm sitting at a poker table right now we all got a cards out."
"5634480","5636180"," And we're dealing the cards."
"5638060","5639940"," And there's this like big burly. "
"5640740","5642640"," He's like this big huge bear."
"5644520","5648940"," He's like big guys got big rippling bear chest."
"5649820","5654220"," Hairy like boobs like big bear man boobs. "
"5654760","5656000"," It's like giants."
"5657700","5667360"," And it's like 5 a.m. We've been playing"
"5667360","5669660"," cards for like the whole weekend."
"5672600","5675460"," He's like starting to smell like cigarette smoke and old whiskey. "
"5679720","5682100"," We just keep dealing hands to each other."
"5685680","5690940"," He looks like he's keeping his cool hair."
"5691100","5692960"," He's like we're going to sell this down to the depths of hell. "
"5693740","5698280"," Going to the depths of hell and I'm thinking to myself is this dude has no idea."
"5699960","5701500"," The time is running out."
"5704760","5706600"," So I keep playing cards with him. "
"5707820","5709640"," He's not quite angry yet."
"5711240","5714620"," Is that like the smelling like old cigarettes and whiskey?"
"5727050","5728990"," He's unaware of what's coming."
"5732470","5734750"," He should be flat and he's not. "
"5738670","5742530"," And I've got like a I've got my my my cards in front of me and I'm like."
"5743710","5746130"," This motherfuckers about to get run the fuck over."
"5747690","5749510"," I don't know if it's the open. "
"5749830","5751110"," I don't know if it's middle of the day."
"5751410","5752350"," I don't know if it's the close."
"5753070","5754210"," I don't know if it's overnight. "
"5754730","5756130"," I don't know if it's tomorrow's open."
"5756530","5759690"," All I know is one thing between now and Friday close."
"5760210","5761690"," This mother fuckers getting run over. "
"5763270","5764250"," Pretty bad."
"5767970","5769270"," Meeting was awesome, man."
"5770150","5771490"," We talked about in stream today. "
"5771550","5772890"," It was absolutely awesome."
"5774150","5775650"," Everything went very well."
"5775890","5777930"," Very happy with the results. "
"5780590","5782530"," It was fascinating."
"5783590","5784470"," It was a fascinating day."
"5784590","5788470"," It was great to even just be able to explain this fully. "
"5789050","5790090"," I wish we could have recorded it."
"5791150","5792050"," To be honest."
"5792050","5796350"," I wish I had recorded it because there were vast portions of it. "
"5797350","5800370"," Where we went through the entire explanation."
"5800970","5802130"," It was a presentation that lasted."
"5805470","5806950"," Four to five hours. "
"5808650","5810250"," It was a long president presentation."
"5811090","5811410"," Never ended."
"5811730","5814150"," Just like go over this, go over that, go over this, go over that. "
"5815010","5817090"," Start at the beginning, work through the entire thing."
"5818090","5819110"," We're going to have to make that video."
"5819110","5821210"," It's some point. "
"5822470","5826870"," We're going to have to do a presentation from start to finish so that when you guys have the tool."
"5828210","5829470"," You can just watch that video."
"5829690","5830070"," I got it. "
"5830990","5833750"," I wanted to record yesterday."
"5834210","5834650"," I should have."
"5835510","5836950"," At some point we're going to have to do that. "
"5839450","5841350"," It basically was the white paper."
"5842870","5843550"," Which we reviewed."
"5850200","5850860"," Hold on a second. "
"5851480","5852380"," Oh, dude, Nick."
"5853200","5857160"," All you do is click the button to chat and it'll say subscribe."
"5857660","5858740"," Hey, Nick, man, couple things. "
"5860560","5861680"," Stop tipping me, man."
"5863700","5865300"," There's two ways to join, brother."
"5866200","5869040"," You can join the chat by clicking the chat button, I think. "
"5869540","5872000"," And then it pops up like subscribe for five bucks or something."
"5872900","5875120"," I try to keep out the scammers."
"5875620","5876440"," That's the only reason I charge. "
"5876680","5877540"," I don't charge to make money."
"5877540","5882420"," I think at the end of the day, I probably take home $2.50, $3."
"5882900","5886840"," I think no, less than that because YouTube takes 30%. "
"5887400","5889300"," Taxes are 30% and they have to handle the money."
"5890000","5891660"," That's like the fees and all that kind of stuff."
"5892360","5894120"," I think I might get like a buck 50, maybe two bucks. "
"5895300","5899040"," I only use it to keep out the scammers."
"5899620","5900660"," I think I'm going to take ten minutes."
"5900860","5901580"," Scammers bots. "
"5902920","5907000"," If you're poor and you're watching right now and you're poor."
"5908270","5911100"," Or you don't like to pay for stuff, I understand that."
"5911660","5916340"," So what you can do is go to Twitch and watch us there. "
"5917420","5920440"," If you watch us on Twitch and you have Amazon Prime."
"5922300","5924620"," You can go to Amazon Prime Gaming."
"5927160","5936580"," And if you sign up for subscribing to me via Amazon Prime Gaming, Amazon Prime Gaming,"
"5936720","5939520"," it's free for you. "
"5940140","5943120"," You can then comment on Twitch videos."
"5945780","5951040"," And I think Bezos gives me $5 of that $5."
"5951320","5954180"," I think I get $1.50 on that too. "
"5955320","5961340"," But you're able, it's a way for you to circumvent the chatting, but it's an extra step to keep the"
"5961340","5962100"," scammers out."
"5962900","5963940"," And you don't pay anything."
"5963940","5966300"," I never make any money off your Amazon purchases. "
"5966640","5967620"," None of that stuff."
"5968220","5972180"," It's just a program that he's running to bring people to Twitch."
"5979720","5981440"," I'm Bank of England's Tenraeros. "
"5981640","5985040"," It's hard to see the break in relationship between CPI and PPI."
"5986680","5988380"," Am I looking for funding?"
"5988700","5988760"," No."
"5989300","5993240"," I want you all to know that I've self-funded this entire thing. "
"5995340","5997300"," It's completely self-funded."
"5999780","6002220"," I do not want any money from anybody."
"6002720","6006860"," It's like the biggest killer of anything is taking money from people. "
"6011920","6019160"," We were talking yesterday about the more the Bank of England raises rates now, the sooner and"
"6019160","6021980"," faster the Bank of England would later need to cut rates."
"6022700","6023860"," Like things that kill startups."
"6024840","6026200"," Usually it's taking people's money. "
"6032830","6033790"," Thanks, Mission P."
"6033950","6034630"," Appreciate it, brother."
"6036530","6038110"," Thanks, Sea Gas."
"6038370","6038750"," Fantastic. "
"6038870","6039370"," I appreciate it."
"6039850","6040750"," We're going to have some cool stuff."
"6041050","6042730"," You're going to get to use it for free. "
"6043510","6047490"," You're going to get like a five-day free use of it."
"6049270","6051090"," We're going to run programs too."
"6051510","6053750"," We have a bunch of free tools, just heads up here. "
"6054450","6055570"," We have a bunch of free shit."
"6056150","6057650"," A few things to say to you guys."
"6057870","6059870"," Number one, there will always be a free option. "
"6059870","6063630"," It will always be like this stuff is free."
"6064190","6066130"," You can always get by in the free option."
"6067970","6072590"," There will be a paid version with other people. "
"6076230","6078290"," What else do you need to know?"
"6084140","6086800"," Not to pry, curious why you needed the meeting yesterday."
"6087940","6090680"," Because we're taking a big step here."
"6090680","6097120"," When you take a large step, people that are involved in what we're doing are like, I want some"
"6097120","6097780"," fucking proof. "
"6098880","6099560"," You know?"
"6100840","6108060"," I have to hire, I already hired them, but like a hired general counsel, like you start to hire"
"6108060","6114420"," people and put them on payroll and they want to make sure what you're fucking doing is not"
"6114420","6114800"," bullshit."
"6115820","6117440"," So that's what it is."
"6117440","6121120"," So you got to meet with these people and be like, you know, is this viable?"
"6121580","6121980"," Is this feasible?"
"6122440","6122860"," Is it not?"
"6124280","6125320"," We shut it all down?"
"6125560","6129620"," Like we just go back to like just like hanging out with some friends and shit like that?"
"6129800","6130600"," Like what are we doing here?"
"6132240","6135420"," The key point here is some of you guys may see that some of you guys don't. "
"6135660","6136980"," The key point here is this."
"6138740","6141840"," I can't be here every day forever, right?"
"6141840","6145940"," I can't absorb the cost of this."
"6147040","6149200"," This has cost me a lot of money at this point. "
"6150700","6152180"," You wouldn't believe it."
"6152800","6153700"," I'm not going to tell you how much."
"6154100","6156680"," You have no idea how much this has cost me a ton of money. "
"6157040","6159180"," And so the time, the effort, the money."
"6159600","6163180"," So at some point this has to be self sustainable."
"6164340","6165860"," So it has to sustain itself. "
"6167820","6171820"," So you're like, we grew this thing into something we weren't expecting."
"6171840","6172600"," You're expecting to grow it into."
"6172840","6173220"," It's awesome. "
"6173720","6174320"," I love it."
"6175520","6177000"," But it has to at some point."
"6178240","6180240"," The community needs to sustain it. "
"6182600","6186260"," Like it's weird because I'm talking to Joe."
"6186440","6190860"," The other day, I'm like, you know, if we're going to grow this into something and we have to have"
"6190860","6191880"," what ease of use."
"6193440","6193880"," Enjoyment. "
"6195080","6196520"," And usefulness, right?"
"6196680","6197740"," Those are three main things."
"6198880","6200800"," And how do you get those?"
"6201020","6203320"," How do you get that usually is from your community?"
"6204100","6205100"," Not from me."
"6205980","6213460"," So, like, as a member in Discord enjoying themselves or most members enjoying themselves. "
"6214100","6214800"," It's a big question."
"6216120","6217860"," That creates the community, right?"
"6218560","6224720"," If your members are enjoying themselves and they're happy, that's how you make it sustainable."
"6225340","6233620"," If your members feel empowered, they're happy, they're empowered, they're enjoying themselves,"
"6233620","6234080"," right?"
"6236540","6237280"," That's good. "
"6238220","6245000"," If your members feel and think that they have ease of use, like, I can find my way around here."
"6248960","6249600"," All right."
"6249840","6251040"," I can find my way around this place. "
"6251400","6252780"," Everything seems pretty easy to use."
"6252920","6253940"," I can show up to the live stream."
"6254120","6255500"," I can show up to the Sunday Stock Show. "
"6256380","6257240"," I have some tools."
"6258360","6259660"," They're clear as day."
"6260180","6260680"," What they mean. "
"6261520","6263200"," They're impact, right?"
"6267470","6270990"," And then you've got members that are providing that stuff, right?"
"6271190","6271730"," I was in Discord."
"6272050","6272090"," Yes."
"6272270","6273290"," Matter of fact, I want you guys to know this. "
"6273370","6275490"," And when I was in this meeting, I put Discord up on a big screen."
"6276810","6282070"," And as you guys were posting in Discord yesterday, I was like, look at these people."
"6282330","6284050"," These people are great fucking traders. "
"6285350","6288090"," I was like, they're working with each other."
"6288810","6290450"," My fucking mind was blown yesterday."
"6291510","6296090"," I was like, in the Discord yesterday, I'm like, these people are trading together. "
"6297750","6299830"," I was like, these people know where the role is."
"6300030","6301090"," These people know where the dip is."
"6301290","6302350"," They know where the fucking buy is. "
"6302470","6303250"," They know where the sell is."
"6304030","6308270"," But these guys are trading together day in, day out, day in, day out."
"6308490","6310130"," Like, that's a fascinating fucking thing. "
"6311790","6312870"," There's people in there."
"6313130","6316430"," You've got John doing educational series inside this."
"6316650","6320630"," We went through the educational channel and I'm like, you can't buy this shit. "
"6320830","6324730"," Like, you can't, like, it's, it's, it's like lightning in a bottle."
"6325790","6329510"," You know, like ease of use, usefulness."
"6332590","6333310"," And enjoyment. "
"6334950","6335310"," Right."
"6335670","6337430"," So, so does this work?"
"6337590","6338330"," Does this not work?"
"6340110","6341830"," Like a really fascinating thing."
"6344510","6345810"," I'm, dude, I was so impressed. "
"6346030","6347830"," I said, like, dude, I wanted to cry yesterday."
"6348650","6349350"," I was reading dick."
"6349590","6350210"," I want to cry right now. "
"6350370","6352070"," Like, I was looking at that Discord yesterday."
"6352230","6355190"," You guys are like, the community is what makes anything."
"6356290","6356730"," It's not me. "
"6358410","6359650"," I don't make anything, dude."
"6362310","6363730"," So you guys elected me."
"6363830","6364130"," That's it. "
"6364470","6365470"," You guys can fire me tomorrow."
"6367270","6367730"," You know?"
"6370390","6373590"," So you guys are, do you guys are what makes, what we do, what we do?"
"6375150","6376030"," So I don't know."
"6376070","6376370"," It's fascinating. "
"6379470","6383180"," And there's nothing like you guys."
"6387060","6387780"," Bad motherfuckers."
"6400150","6401690"," Sellers stepping in right now. "
"6401690","6408590"," I've got a bear cross above on the one minute chart on the 27 EMA, the 129 EMA, and the"
"6408590","6409370"," six right now."
"6413220","6414620"," Look out for a roll below."
"6414860","6419520"," If you are long trying to buy that hourly trigger is down here at 436 40. "
"6420500","6424140"," You're just long the market want to put on some puts as a hedge down here."
"6424140","6425120"," I understand."
"6428700","6435220"," So, anyways, we've got seven. "
"6435560","6440440"," So what we're doing right now is where what's really crazy is right now we're every month we're"
"6440440","6442420"," going in and removing inactive users."
"6442980","6448780"," So if you're like an inactive user for longer than a month, we remove you from the discord."
"6449700","6452980"," So right now we have, are you ready for how many active users?"
"6453420","6457260"," Like, so right now it's 460, but active users in the discord right now. "
"6457260","6459780"," I guess how many we have 1770."
"6461200","6467140"," So over the course of a month, about 1770 people are going in there at different times of the day,"
"6467660","6468460"," which is fascinating."
"6469920","6472820"," So you like, that's a significant amount of people. "
"6472980","6475980"," They're like, I got to get inside that discord and make sure my trade is good."
"6475980","6480240"," Even if they don't interact, they're like, go in that fucking discord because I know those guys"
"6480240","6480940"," know what they're doing."
"6481980","6482900"," It's pretty badass. "
"6483340","6486320"," Like, it's a fucking badass, man."
"6488340","6488820"," Congratulations."
"6490300","6491880"," Congratulations to the members of that discord. "
"6498580","6499060"," Yeah."
"6504690","6506570"," So what we had, we had a problem."
"6509470","6512150"," So we're a financial discord, right?"
"6512990","6514850"," We're not a gaming discord. "
"6517070","6524550"," So scammers know that they're not going to take a 12 year old for a ride, right?"
"6525550","6528730"," They know that you being in financials, that one, you have money."
"6529270","6530650"," Two, you want to spend it."
"6531370","6534010"," And three, some of you are going to be gullible. "
"6534010","6540430"," So they'll go into financial discords and they'll try to run scams on users."
"6542450","6543810"," It's a very common thing."
"6544110","6545550"," So we're fighting it. "
"6546210","6548810"," So we right now are the most secure you can be."
"6549330","6551350"," We've done everything discord wants us to do."
"6551850","6553430"," We have like eight factor authentication. "
"6554130","6557850"," We have all kinds of crazy shit to keep these bots and scammers out."
"6559050","6565850"," People that are trying to take information, steal shit, steal like your alpha in there."
"6566830","6571330"," And so what we do is we go through every month, every month, man. "
"6571890","6577130"," And if you're not an active user in that discord, like, hey, I signed up three months ago, and I"
"6577130","6577930"," haven't done anything."
"6578630","6580330"," I haven't been back to the discord."
"6580570","6581670"," I haven't said hello. "
"6582470","6583750"," We remove you from the discord."

"6613330","6614810"," Don't feel like you have to say anything."

"6648250","6651750"," I want to talk about mowing my lawn or trip."
"6651750","6652490"," I got coming up."
"6653710","6656090"," I don't know anything but the stock market. "
"6657270","6658390"," We have that place too."
"6664170","6666070"," So it's not all market related."
"6666310","6668230"," It's mostly market related discord. "
"6668230","6671050"," But we even have places for you if you're like, I don't think I've anything to add."
"6671350","6673110"," So we're going to be like, Hey, what's going on, everybody?"
"6673530","6674990"," I just want a friend or something."
"6676130","6676990"," Someone to talk to. "
"6677850","6681830"," You know, like, you're like, Fintuit's like, Fintuit's like Mad Max, right?"
"6682050","6682630"," Like, you don't have a Fintuit."
"6682630","6683110"," You're just like."
"6686610","6692210"," And you like, you like a turn that turn around and take a shot with that, with that arrow and"
"6692210","6694630"," the rope on it and just murder that guy over there. "
"6694630","6701410"," And it is, it is, it is like as a dune buggy, like shoot that guy over there."
"6702170","6703750"," You like driving around."
"6709670","6712870"," Someone's like throwing fire bombs at Captain Jim out in the desert. "
"6713210","6719390"," Like flames coming off the back of my, my, my dune buggy."
"6736730","6737630"," That's not our discord."
"6738870","6739390"," That's Twitter. "
"6740410","6742590"," So if you can just want a place that you can like fuck Twitter."
"6742830","6743370"," I'm out of here today."
"6743670","6744310"," I don't want to dry. "
"6744450","6748190"," I don't want to, I don't want to raise student buggies in the desert with a bunch of mutants."
"6751450","6752370"," I'm going to take a break."
"6752490","6754010"," I'm going to get into discord and just chill. "
"6775210","6776190"," Twitter's crazy, man."
"6777730","6779430"," All I can think about is Mad Max."
"6779430","6780130"," Like Twitter. "
"6780790","6781810"," Twitter's like, um."
"6785450","6786710"," Hold on a second here."
"6792280","6793260"," Let's take a look at Twitter. "
"6793560","6794100"," You guys want to, all right."
"6794220","6794280"," Twitter."
"6794420","6794620"," Let's see. "
"6794620","6795020"," Look at Tesla."
"6798760","6800720"," What's that town in Mad Max called?"
"6800980","6801380"," Bordertown."
"6801580","6801880"," What's it called?"
"6802020","6802440"," Mad Max. "
"6809960","6811260"," It's waters for trolling."
"6811260","6811600"," Yeah."
"6816620","6817460"," Bartertown, dudes. "
"6817760","6818260"," Bartertown."
"6823500","6824500"," Twitter's bartertown."
"6826660","6827420"," All right. "
"6827620","6828720"," So what's going on down here?"
"6831900","6833320"," What's going on over here?"
"6839860","6841000"," We got a what?"
"6841380","6842840"," Tesla bulls are like, we're out of here."
"6843680","6845580"," We're following the green line."
"6845820","6846620"," Suck it. "
"6846760","6847260"," We're out of here."
"6849520","6850720"," Look at that."
"6850920","6851540"," It's so crazy. "
"6854380","6856080"," Look at Tesla here."
"6856240","6859860"," Tesla's just like, uh, so Tesla used to trade."
"6860580","6863060"," It's daily or frequently trades. "
"6863060","6863680"," It's daily."
"6864760","6864840"," Not."
"6865160","6868720"," It's, um, hourly for big moves. "
"6868720","6871060"," So I want you to see this here."
"6872620","6875160"," I guess to you, Tesla looks pretty bullish here."
"6875860","6881240"," Um, to me, it does not see this right here. "
"6881840","6887500"," I mean, it's cooling off, but I always like this for the big move in Tesla."
"6888060","6897980"," So, um, for me personally, I'm"
"6897980","6903720"," not anti you buying the hourly for inter day trades."
"6904380","6908480"," I feel like, yeah, I bought that cap or coming back into it right now. "
"6908480","6909040"," I bought that."
"6909360","6913300"," And hey, captain, I want to buy that as long as we stay above a certain price."
"6913660","6914140"," I get that. "
"6915640","6916420"," I understand."
"6919400","6920800"," I completely understand."
"6921320","6925260"," So if you're bullish on Tesla, I would say this to you. "
"6927660","6929920"," As long as Tesla remains above."
"6932960","6936640"," Two fifty five fifty nine by the dip."
"6938660","6942920"," Now, when I make those statements to you, do you see this wick right here, right?"
"6943140","6944660"," Didn't remain above the hourly trigger there. "
"6944660","6945000"," Did it?"
"6946160","6950860"," So what I'm implying to you is that when I say to you."
"6951740","6954140"," Long as it stays above, it's hourly trigger."
"6956100","6965600"," What you don't want to see is a closing bar on a thirty minute chart closing"
"6965600","6968580"," bar underneath. "
"6969460","6972080"," Okay, so you don't want to see that."
"6973220","6983100"," Now, if you see this, you'll likely get this, but you'll also likely get a pull higher like this."
"6986760","6993820"," So if you see the closing bar in a thirty minute chart, you'll see the initial move down. "
"6994200","6995020"," It'll pull back up."
"6996060","6998400"," You then exit your long trade."
"7000560","7004380"," You'll likely then see something like this. "
"7004380","7008020"," And it will roll."
"7009180","7010500"," So this isn't qualifying."
"7010980","7011740"," That does not qualify. "
"7012440","7013600"," That does not qualify."
"7014040","7015060"," That does not qualify."
"7015660","7017940"," This is where you buy the dip. "
"7018640","7019240"," Okay."
"7020820","7023460"," Now you're actually dip buying right now on Tesla."
"7024520","7025840"," You're not selling. "
"7026160","7027580"," This is the place to buy."
"7028400","7030520"," This is the place to sell Tesla."
"7031020","7031220"," See it?"
"7032000","7036060"," I'm assuming that a bunch of you that were sellers of Tesla got smoked there. "
"7036180","7041080"," You got smoked here, and you got smoked here, and you got smoked here."
"7042440","7044280"," So this is the place to buy Tesla."
"7044600","7046540"," Now, big picture. "
"7047740","7051040"," I don't like seeing flattening of hourly."
"7051600","7053560"," I love seeing hourly going up."
"7055200","7058700"," Flat is not bad necessarily, but it's not good. "
"7058700","7061520"," I never like seeing hourly going down."
"7061720","7062380"," That's bad, right?"
"7062640","7064700"," See the hourly going down, right?"
"7064980","7065800"," See the hourly going up?"
"7066060","7067300"," See price above the hourly?"
"7067600","7067960"," All bullish."
"7068600","7076020"," So on a higher time frame, pulling out the goggles, I"
"7076020","7080940"," still like the idea of buying lower. "
"7081920","7090140"," So you can intraday trade Tesla here, but I still think we get a dip to buy."
"7090860","7095600"," It's likely at 240 to 250."
"7097540","7100360"," 240 to 250, probably 245ish. "
"7109380","7114920"," So yeah, if we get a run up into the weekend, that's fine."
"7114920","7116860"," If we get a run up for 4th of July, that's fine."
"7117480","7121060"," But I would like to buy it down here, like 240 to even lower. "
"7121320","7130120"," If we started selling today, we sold tomorrow, I'd like to personally buy 234.42. I don't know when"
"7130120","7132820"," this happens, but whatever it does, I'm going to buy it."
"7133960","7134720"," So I'll say that to you."
"7136000","7136820"," I'll buy it. "
"7137780","7142640"," We can also trade as low as 205, and I'd buy the fuck out of that too."
"7143620","7147160"," But I think there's another dip down here to buy, personally."
"7148320","7152300"," I think any move higher is unsustainable on Tesla. "
"7152620","7159680"," So I'm bullish here in Tesla intraday, and if they have Tesla trades above the green, I'll trade"
"7159680","7160460"," that all day long too."
"7161160","7167680"," So I'm not like anti-Tesla going up here at all, but I would like to see a pullback, a"
"7167680","7169600"," little bit more substance than this one right here."
"7171200","7174540"," I guess this does count as tagging the hourly. "
"7175440","7176320"," It has recovered."
"7177400","7179500"," All signs say bullish into the upside here."
"7180680","7186660"," So maybe we can go back up there and at least tag that 280, 277 maybe, and then roll it"
"7186660","7187100"," back over. "
"7189860","7192860"," At least make an attempt for this previous high here."
"7194040","7197800"," As long as you stay above, remember, no closing bar below."
"7200100","7203580"," And we're a little bit almost here to make a turn here. "
"7204840","7209320"," So we're going to find out if the green bars, you see the right here."
"7209420","7212360"," We could come over and bounce again, right?"
"7212520","7213060"," So that's possible."
"7213860","7214600"," We can do that. "
"7215880","7219640"," If we do this down here, what you're going to do is see this right here, right?"
"7219960","7221120"," You'll see that just like that."
"7221160","7222340"," You'll see that move right there, right?"
"7222920","7223360"," Bam, bam, bam."
"7223820","7226000"," Then we'll get that dip bite down there for Tesla. "
"7226480","7236100"," It's like 236 right now, 237.50. So if we get that closing bar below, see right here."
"7238720","7240240"," See right where we are right now."
"7240820","7243220"," You want to see if we get a closing red bar. "
"7243380","7245380"," Remember, closing red bar."
"7248620","7250560"," Because this half hour right here, right?"
"7251360","7252440"," One, two, three, four."
"7252440","7254860"," Four times, sellers got smoked right there. "
"7255100","7255540"," Smoked."
"7256420","7257440"," Like woof, gone."
"7258680","7263360"," So you need a closing red bar and the half an hour on Tesla off your sell side. "
"7263720","7269500"," If you're going to sell it, and you get that first half an hour red bar down here, there's going"
"7269500","7273940"," to be a chance for you to sell this down to 235 on Tesla."
"7278020","7279380"," So let's look at Tesla here."
"7290450","7291350"," Shut you right now. "
"7300510","7300830"," Ready?"
"7301630","7303210"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope."
"7304110","7305390"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope."
"7306330","7307670"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope. "
"7308250","7309470"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope."
"7310070","7311190"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope."
"7311190","7311590"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, get fucked. "
"7313510","7315090"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope."
"7315550","7316990"," It's going to crash, it's going to crash, nope."
"7316990","7320310"," So I guess maybe this is the time it crashes, right?"
"7322530","7323690"," How many chances do you get?"
"7323890","7326530"," One, two, three, four, five, six. "
"7327750","7330210"," It's going to crash, it's the seventh time, right?"
"7334750","7344550"," My assumption here would be, my assumption here would be, the trade is not to be short right"
"7344550","7344830"," here."
"7348760","7353780"," The trade is to allow a closing bar, boom, boom."
"7358560","7360640"," It should squeeze higher here. "
"7362660","7365500"," And that the down trade is like right here."
"7366120","7368460"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"7368880","7371600"," The one that you're actually looking for is like right there. "
"7373380","7374840"," That's the money trade."
"7378240","7383020"," I'm assuming that people on social media are like, yeah, dude, I shorted this one, I shorted that"
"7383020","7387720"," one, they disappear, shorted that one, disappeared, shorted that one, disappeared, shorted that"
"7387720","7389240"," one, disappeared, shorted that one, disappeared, shorted without one, disappeared."
"7389620","7390800"," I'm sure they're short right now too. "
"7391300","7393660"," I bet someone's telling you out there right now, there's short Tesla."
"7395480","7399560"," There's got to be one voice of one person out there right now that's like, I'm short Tesla."
"7401480","7403340"," And they're going to disappear if it bounces. "
"7406400","7410120"," the trade is not to be short here, the trade is to be short after."
"7412680","7413660"," Does that make sense?"
"7415140","7416860"," Or they're trading $1,000 accounts?"
"7418080","7418700"," Where are they trading?"
"7420740","7425140"," I'm assuming that they're trading $1,000,000 accounts and they got burned, they got burned, they"
"7425140","7428340"," got burned, they got burned, they got burned, they got burned, they got burned again, they got"
"7428340","7429180"," burned again, I don't know."
"7430500","7434340"," Or maybe they were short up here I guess, they shorted that, shorted that, shorted that, shorted"
"7434340","7434520"," that. "
"7435300","7436080"," I don't know."
"7436800","7439380"," Maybe they're flat right now, they've been just trying to do all this shit."
"7440180","7441380"," Hasn't worked yet, I don't know. "
"7441680","7442700"," I don't know what the answer is."
"7443280","7444800"," I know that voice is very loud though."
"7445520","7448460"," I know like the voice right here is the loudest. "
"7449980","7453720"," This is where the drums beat, like doo doo doo doo doo doo."
"7454560","7458240"," I know this is the one where people take the short and they don't take it here."
"7459000","7459800"," Like the masses. "
"7461040","7465040"," I know that most traders aren't, don't, don't, don't trade this here."
"7465680","7470020"," They mostly like watch it go down and then they're like fuck that, hit the short button."
"7470860","7472240"," And they're like short right fucking here. "
"7473540","7475580"," I think there's a short here, I just think it's below."
"7477240","7478860"," I think the trap is here."
"7488280","7490540"," Look at them, they're bleeding out the spy right now. "
"7497370","7502430"," Just added a bunch of calls up on one penny right now."
"7503330","7504070"," Flat right now."
"7507350","7508730"," So, so mad. "
"7508910","7509310"," Look at them."
"7510450","7510790"," So angry."
"7513670","7514590"," So angry. "
"7515070","7516130"," Sellers man, they're so brutal."
"7530500","7531560"," So, so raging."
"7532200","7533100"," Look at them, so angry. "
"7540940","7542540"," All we do is keep going up."
"7547550","7550310"," Up, up, up."
"7554540","7555140"," Do we go up?"
"7558300","7559200"," So angry. "
"7566070","7567650"," So angry they are."
"7578310","7579930"," So angry."
"7582330","7584530"," Mike Barry, don't patronize me. "
"7590170","7591870"," So angry."
"7592990","7593870"," So saucy."
"7600070","7602310"," So let me know, are you short here or no?"
"7603730","7607110"," I always feel like the drums are like the drums beat the loudest here. "
"7612370","7614650"," But I think it's like you take the money and run here."
"7615670","7618950"," And then the second short is like below like bam, bam, bam."
"7619290","7621250"," Like this is the second short down here. "
"7622030","7623050"," It's not right here."
"7623210","7625090"," It's like the danger zone for being short."
"7628970","7631030"," Seven or eight times there was about right there. "
"7631210","7631710"," So we'll see."
"7634550","7636630"," It's where I bought the dip this morning right down here."
"7637170","7638010"," I bought it right here. "
"7642750","7644270"," I am a little stinky though."
"7644430","7645490"," My calls are like flat."
"7645670","7647170"," I probably should have taken profit up here. "
"7648210","7649630"," But I have faith right now."
"7652310","7654170"," I'm not feeling scared here."
"7655950","7659070"," I guess I have to feel fear, don't I?"
"7664350","7665830"," Twitter is the Thunderdome. "
"7668170","7668690"," Yes."
"7668890","7670630"," So a big ball says he's short right now."
"7673110","7673890"," Big balls. "
"7674090","7675430"," How many of you are short right now?"
"7678050","7679730"," My 441s are flat right now."
"7680530","7683710"," They're exactly what I paid for them in the beginning."
"7683890","7685070"," I haven't lost a fucking penny here. "
"7685210","7697120"," So I'm"
"7697120","7697480"," fascinated."
"7698340","7700880"," Winky, can you run a poll here and find out who's short?"
"7702280","7712020"," I'm fascinated because I'm fascinated because I don't see the shorts unless you have closing"
"7712020","7713060"," bars up here."
"7713060","7714020"," I don't see it. "
"7714340","7715740"," So I want to know what you guys are thinking."
"7719210","7722270"," Like I see the bouncing get that."
"7724190","7725650"," They get all that right there. "
"7728890","7730570"," But we're going up, right?"
"7730770","7731510"," We're not going down."
"7732050","7734650"," We're going up."
"7734810","7735190"," I know that. "
"7736690","7746330"," So I guess my question here is do I would like to see like a red bar like that."
"7747890","7751390"," And then a green bar like this."
"7754170","7756970"," Maybe another like failed attempt up here. "
"7757990","7764330"," And then I'd like to see a red bar like right there and jump on that short right there."
"7765130","7766230"," Like this one right here."
"7766350","7768890"," Like cut my calls and didn't go short the market. "
"7782020","7784120"," We're trying to make a proof right now."
"7785700","7788100"," So yesterday we were doing proofs on the market."
"7788740","7790460"," I was in some meetings yesterday. "
"7791960","7794540"," And we were talking about proofs on the market."
"7794860","7799000"," So I'm trying to prove some stuff here."
"7803940","7805180"," Higher time frame stuff. "
"7807180","7808040"," That kind of stuff."
"7812090","7812990"," Are they at this?"
"7813130","7815230"," I want to know like somebody opening short here."
"7816630","7818430"," Like are you opening a short position?"
"7818790","7819350"," That's what I want to know. "
"7819550","7820770"," Like are you opening it right here?"
"7823170","7824690"," We're trying to prove some stuff here."
"7825250","7826630"," It would if it was me."
"7827350","7828690"," If I was short here, right?"
"7829750","7833170"," I would be taking the money and running right here and be out flat. "
"7835130","7839850"," And I wouldn't care if we had another red bar down here."
"7840370","7842090"," Because it could rip back up on you still."
"7842450","7844050"," Like I think this is the money trade right here. "
"7846390","7847870"," Like that's the money part of the trade."
"7848210","7849510"," This is the risky part of the trade."
"7849770","7851110"," This is the risky part of the trade. "
"7851610","7853210"," This is the money part of the trade right here."
"7854950","7859230"," And I think that the next trade below hasn't started yet."
"7861470","7866910"," So I'm always fascinated when like people are starting to open short like right here. "
"7868890","7872810"," I can I just showed you that the last eight times you would have gotten torched."
"7873810","7876810"," So I question that if I believe people."
"7877830","7879170"," Does that make sense?"
"7880290","7887710"," So so sometimes we'll have people in the chat will say things like you know like I'm short here. "
"7888650","7893670"," And then they disappear or they close them out or whatever and so like the statistics."
"7894230","7897530"," So the statistics say that you're wrong is my point."
"7899330","7900650"," No, not just that you're wrong. "
"7901370","7906850"," The statistics say that you're going to get blown up like eight times doing that 10 times 30 times"
"7906850","7909810"," 100 times like 70 out of 100 times you're going to get blown up."
"7911330","7913130"," So that's why I ask."
"7917210","7918890"," But can we go lower here?"
"7919050","7919370"," We can. "
"7920430","7925430"," But the number of times that we don't is statistically mind blowing."
"7930010","7933950"," That you actually lose."
"7934950","7935670"," That's why I ask. "
"7936750","7938910"," I'm not asking because I want to know."
"7940730","7942250"," I'm asking to find out."
"7944270","7946510"," If you're blowing up your account most of the time. "
"7952910","7962830"," Is that second leg of that trade down doesn't start yet wave it in afternoon"
"7962830","7969190"," trading today as a batch of stronger than expected data on the US economy kept Wall Street on"
"7969190","7972110"," alerts for further interest rate hikes by the federal reserve."
"7972890","7973790"," It's fascinating too."
"7973950","7975670"," Like you're hearing news right now from. "
"7976910","7980810"," You're hearing news right now from the squawk right."
"7981490","7982710"," The squawks telling you."
"7985450","7986630"," The Bank of England. "
"7987050","7988490"," 10 Ray Rayro."
"7988990","7994770"," The more B.O.A. raises rates now the sooner the faster B.O.A. will later need to cut."
"7995990","7997550"," And you're getting like bad news. "
"7999050","8001070"," Just as we touch the hourly trigger."
"8001310","8002030"," Why do you think that is?"
"8002530","8003550"," Free daily point."
"8003790","8004650"," The banachi. "
"8004830","8005630"," I think that's kind of bizarre."
"8005930","8007170"," I like by signing up."
"8007290","8009470"," Bad news comes in just as you hit a specific target. "
"8010070","8014320"," I think it's fascinating."
"8015740","8016660"," I think it's fascinating."
"8024580","8026880"," You don't get big balls with by going with stats. "
"8027100","8028120"," That's what stats cap."
"8031240","8035580"," I have just fascinated by it because there's like this trade here."
"8036020","8036380"," Right. "
"8037160","8038240"," We saw that trade."
"8038340","8039140"," We knew that was rolling."
"8039660","8041760"," We talked about the risk here. "
"8041860","8042480"," I said put some."
"8042680","8045120"," I said if you're along the market put a hedge on right."
"8045460","8046980"," You guys heard me in stream say that right. "
"8047980","8049300"," You guys hear me say that in streams."
"8049500","8051500"," Should I turn the stream off right."
"8052340","8055020"," And just take 10 minutes to cut it out. "
"8055840","8058120"," Where I said you might want to put a hedge on right here."
"8058700","8060640"," You guys remember that part of the stream or you guys."
"8061120","8063280"," You guys have like selective memory. "
"8065080","8067020"," Do you remember what I said to you right here."
"8067040","8070180"," I said you likely want to put a hedge on the market if you're along it."
"8072360","8075900"," You guys remember that probably not. "
"8075900","8079800"," And then I'm fascinated by people starting a short right here."
"8085120","8087720"," I want to know if they're starting a short right there."
"8088980","8091020"," I'm assuming you're upside down right now right. "
"8091180","8092300"," You're getting you're getting torched."
"8093680","8095240"," You're getting burned right now right."
"8096140","8097600"," You're on fire right now. "
"8099300","8100560"," Here you want some gasoline."
"8108090","8108910"," Will that help?"
"8112980","8113660"," Here's some gasoline."
"8114040","8114780"," I'll burn it for you. "
"8125850","8133900"," So just to make our users aware as well."
"8143080","8150840"," I'm going to read this to you guys here."
"8152560","8155200"," I'm going to give you guys a version of this right now. "
"8155440","8158080"," So we know who Nick Temeros is right guys."
"8158380","8158400"," Awesome."
"8158700","8159060"," Love him. "
"8159080","8162780"," Normal subscription does not seem to cover this."
"8165400","8167220"," I'm going to give you guys a link to it."
"8167620","8170280"," The link that I'm giving you is an archived version. "
"8175910","8180490"," So there's an archived version of the Nick Temeros story that just came out from the Wall Street"
"8180490","8180730"," Journal."
"8181270","8182470"," I'm going to read it to you."
"8185550","8186610"," Remember what I said. "
"8186870","8192150"," Are you starting a short position here?"
"8195600","8199820"," Are you starting a short position here?"
"8206980","8209799"," Yeah, there's some member berries out there."
"8210000","8210360"," Aren't there?"
"8211459","8213120"," Good job Wall Street woes."
"8223459","8225500"," I can remember berries. "
"8226000","8229180"," I love you Wall Street woes."
"8233639","8235219"," That's right, the Fed's mouthpiece."
"8241240","8245440"," Okay, so I'll read this to you right now. "
"8248420","8253100"," Jerome Powell says bank failures underscore need for stronger regulation supervision."
"8253879","8260000"," Fed chair says he looks forward to evaluating proposals for such changes."
"8262760","8264420"," So let's look at that closely. "
"8264799","8264959"," Okay."
"8265420","8269360"," So Jerome Powell says bank failures underscore the need for stronger regulation and supervision."
"8270139","8277920"," Number one, the banking insurance or the FDIC insurance is a disaster. "
"8279200","8283340"," Like I was a year or two ago, people were like, I was past spring."
"8283559","8286580"," People were like, I think Yellen might have said this shit."
"8286580","8290600"," Like we don't need to increase insurance for banking deposits. "
"8290600","8297299"," I'm like, I found people in thin to it were like, small businesses don't have $250,000."
"8298100","8299620"," And I'm like, are you smoking crack?"
"8300719","8306280"," Like small businesses burned through like, or they will have easily in a week or a month,"
"8306280","8308520"," exchanging a million dollars."
"8309299","8309360"," Minimum. "
"8310299","8310780"," Minimum."
"8312180","8312520"," That's true."
"8312799","8313660"," Like it's a small business. "
"8314320","8315280"," Million dollars."
"8317280","8318219"," Exchanging hands."
"8319180","8320020"," Like I pay them. "
"8320200","8320719"," They pay me."
"8320920","8321480"," This comes in."
"8321639","8322120"," I pay that. "
"8322740","8325920"," A lot of small businesses don't make a lot of money."
"8326799","8328799"," But you know what a lot of small businesses do?"
"8329840","8333020"," They're entrusted with other people's money."
"8333879","8334780"," Let that sink in. "
"8335500","8338580"," So a lot of small businesses are not that profitable."
"8339180","8342100"," You'll meet small business owners and they'll be like, yeah, I did all right this year."
"8343180","8345700"," But always find out what they are actually processing. "
"8346360","8350379"," And it's fascinating because they'll be like, oh, I did a $10 million last year."
"8351059","8352260"," My in revs, right?"
"8352379","8354139"," We're 10 or not even I forget the revs."
"8354200","8359080"," We had revs come in, but then we were like, nine million, nine million, nine hundred thousand went"
"8359080","8359340"," out. "
"8360120","8361139"," Last year too."
"8361900","8363820"," So I was like the gatekeeper of that shit."
"8364860","8366040"," That's all I was, right?"
"8368480","8376860"," So I'm a little flabbergasted at not making the insurance relative to today. "
"8377680","8379940"," Like million dollars, maybe a couple million."
"8381219","8385520"," The other thing is the bank there is underscore the need for stronger regulation."
"8386840","8395480"," A lot of these banks that failed operate in an environment that supports starting risky ventures. "
"8397040","8400800"," We don't want to stifle that to some extent."
"8401800","8411560"," I have businesses that I own and some of my businesses that I own because of how I structure my"
"8411560","8416160"," companies, I can't do banking anywhere I want."
"8416580","8417500"," That's true right now. "
"8417760","8422900"," I have one business in particular that I only have one state that I can bank in."
"8422900","8428680"," That's willing to even do the business with me because of the risk associated with what I do."
"8431960","8436240"," So anyways, you don't want to strangle that. "
"8436420","8437480"," Who does want to strangle that?"
"8437560","8446020"," Do you know these large banks do like large banks like JPM GS, they would like nothing more than"
"8446020","8447880"," for strangulation."
"8449280","8452720"," With regulation more regulation better."
"8452920","8456820"," It is for larger banking and supervision. "
"8456880","8458400"," Now that one I agree with."
"8459140","8460420"," I agree with that one a lot."
"8460660","8465800"," There's a lot of regulation in banks like the one thing that fascinated me about the failure of"
"8465800","8473620"," these banks, which did piss me off was dude, they fucking like the fed told you the fucking fed. "
"8473620","8479080"," Like first time in history said we're going to tell you when we're raising rates."
"8480060","8482940"," Like they literally fucking for warned you."
"8483360","8485220"," So that was a head scratch for me. "
"8485640","8490620"," So supervision I like because that did piss me off."
"8491420","8496860"," Now that part of the banking failure shows that these bankers don't give a fuck, right?"
"8497100","8497660"," They are whores."
"8498500","8499080"," That's what they are. "
"8499180","8499820"," They're fucking whores."
"8500140","8502280"," They will fucking drain it until it breaks."
"8502280","8505060"," They give a fuck about you and they give a fuck about me. "
"8505760","8507720"," So there's a lot of bump banks I don't like."
"8508580","8510960"," So like supervision part I like."
"8512940","8518660"," Fed Chair says he looks forward to evaluating proposals for such changes in this article. "
"8518720","8522360"," So watch that motherfucker come right back."
"8522820","8524020"," Hot sauce coming through."
"8524200","8525320"," Hot sauce coming through right now. "
"8526000","8527140"," Hot sauce coming through."
"8529920","8532560"," So what's fascinating about this is you want."
"8533760","8541600"," You want to support banking participants like people that go to the bank. "
"8542400","8544340"," You want to encourage."
"8545640","8550280"," Well I guess you want to and sometimes you want to and sometimes you don't want to encourage new"
"8550280","8551040"," business growth."
"8552940","8556980"," But you need to fucking watch the guys that are watching over that, right?"
"8557120","8558380"," The guys that own the bank. "
"8558820","8559320"," That guy."
"8560000","8560480"," CEO."
"8561920","8562360"," CFO. "
"8563560","8564420"," I don't fucking know."
"8564580","8565620"," The chief compliance officer."
"8566220","8567260"," They're all scumbags, right?"
"8567740","8569340"," You see sweet guys are fucking pigs. "
"8570340","8572100"," Those guys need to go to prison."
"8572680","8574340"," You need to put those fucking guys under supervision."
"8576860","8577680"," You know what I mean?"
"8578980","8582520"," So Fed Chair says he looks forward to evaluating proposals for such changes. "
"8583500","8588840"," Watch this stuff as it plays out because you don't want to stifle some things."
"8589100","8592480"," You do want to support people that did the right thing."
"8593040","8594140"," And there's a last part of this. "
"8594940","8596820"," And that's when a bank has a run."
"8597920","8600600"," There's nothing that the Fed can do."
"8600860","8603440"," There's nothing that the Senate can do. "
"8604200","8605820"," Zero if there's a bank run."
"8606200","8611520"," There is no way to regulate or supervise if that happens."
"8612180","8614060"," There's nothing you can do in place of it. "
"8614220","8618460"," But the people at the top of these fucking banks, man, are fucking pigs."
"8619700","8624000"," And we likely won't do any supervising to put them in prison."
"8625460","8633420"," You know, if you put one in prison, you got to put them all in prison. "
"8635000","8637020"," And that's like going to court."
"8637760","8638200"," Right?"
"8638480","8640000"," So I have to go to court have tenants, right?"
"8640120","8640900"," Sometimes I have to go to court."
"8641440","8642860"," You know what you don't do when you go to court?"
"8643140","8644580"," You don't represent yourself. "
"8645800","8646620"," You have an attorney."
"8647980","8648420"," Right?"
"8648880","8651420"," Because the attorneys go to school to be attorneys."
"8652260","8652520"," Right?"
"8652740","8654920"," They go to school to be attorneys to pay all this money. "
"8655660","8657760"," And I'm going to walk in there and try to be an attorney."
"8658220","8658700"," Fuck no."
"8659820","8660520"," Fuck no. "
"8660840","8661940"," There's a whole thing for this."
"8661940","8665000"," If I do that, I look like a jackass, right?"
"8665760","8667200"," I think I'm smarter than an attorney."
"8667720","8669120"," I don't respect the profession. "
"8669280","8669700"," Guess what else?"
"8670080","8671300"," There's a judge up there."
"8671980","8673740"," And that fucking judge went to law school."
"8674420","8675480"," These guys need to get paid. "
"8675840","8676840"," They have their whole thing."
"8677080","8677900"," Like everything they do."
"8678600","8679940"," A whole society culture. "
"8680500","8680840"," All of this."
"8681860","8687480"," So I do find it fascinating that Jerome is saying we have to regulate the banks."
"8688260","8689120"," And I'm like, wait a minute. "
"8689120","8690620"," This fucking guy is a banker too."
"8693420","8694700"," Who's getting hurt here?"
"8696660","8699460"," It's likely not the attorneys and the judges."
"8703520","8704600"," So fascinating. "
"8704800","8706780"," It's fascinating to see how this works itself out."
"8706960","8709520"," I do like that he's saying this, but I find it hilarious."
"8714090","8722950"," Because whatever regulation and supervision is coming, it likely benefits bankers and not you. "
"8732370","8734230"," I added to my position down there."
"8734510","8735010"," I'm long, man."
"8735190","8736310"," I'm long into tomorrow's clothes. "
"8737350","8737930"," I am long."
"8739110","8740790"," Long, long, long, long, long, long, long."
"8741710","8742730"," Would you take profit here?"
"8742890","8743910"," Yeah, take profit right up here. "
"8745390","8746370"," Right where you are right now."
"8749550","8751110"," Are they going to try to roll it right here?"
"8752390","8754610"," It's likely going to go right up into that bell right there."
"8755910","8757030"," So there's your answer. "
"8757930","8759070"," There's likely another dip buy."
"8762030","8764190"," It's going to read the rest of this story to you right now."
"8766370","8768070"," How's your short going, by the way?"
"8768990","8769510"," Making money?"
"8770870","8771770"," I remember, right?"
"8772490","8773110"," I asked one question. "
"8773910","8775190"," I said, are you starting a short here?"
"8776150","8777790"," People are like, yes."
"8777790","8783550"," And then later on, as it turned green, they said, well, I started it way up high."
"8783770","8784410"," I'm like, OK, that's cool. "
"8785290","8786230"," Say whatever you want."
"8786550","8788150"," I just want to know if you're short or if you're long."
"8788910","8789550"," So I want to know. "
"8793450","8801290"," So Fed Chair Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said, the failures of Silicon Valley Bank and two other"
"8801290","8807230"," midsize lenders this spring underscore the need for strong capital buffers to ensure the banking"
"8807230","8813490"," system is resilient during times of stress, which these banks did not do, right?"
"8814110","8822230"," We know that they were warned that we would have rate increases at that point."
"8823610","8825990"," They should have increased their capital buffers, right?"
"8826190","8829690"," They should have done that shit two years ago and they fucking didn't."
"8831510","8832310"," That's bad. "
"8832310","8833750"," Who made those decisions?"
"8834410","8834970"," CEOs did."
"8836470","8840070"," The events of the last couple months would have been much more difficult to manage."
"8840150","8844690"," Manage had the largest banks been under-capitalized or illiquid. "
"8845470","8849970"," Powell said remarks prepared for delivery at a conference in Madrid on Thursday morning."
"8851450","8859150"," The Fed has come under fire from some critics in recent months for its role in easing supervision"
"8859150","8864990"," and regulation of midsize banks, which followed by partisan legislation signed into law by then"
"8864990","8866570"," Donald Trump in 2018."
"8868110","8874430"," The bank failures suggested a need to strengthen our supervision and regulation of institutions of"
"8874430","8876030"," the size of SVB. "
"8876390","8880030"," Powell said referencing or referring to Silicon Valley Bank."
"8880610","8887530"," I look forward to evaluating proposals for such changes and implementing them where appropriate he"
"8887530","8887710"," added."
"8888150","8892790"," What's fascinating about this is if you just threaten prison, that's all you have to do. "
"8893230","8893870"," It's very simple."
"8894610","8896290"," You just threaten prison with these guys."
"8898430","8901370"," You fuck around as a CEO, you get ten years. "
"8902230","8903110"," It's very simple."
"8904330","8905910"," We won't do that though, will we?"
"8906130","8907290"," There's no fucking way we're going to do that."
"8910890","8912370"," That's how I feel about it. "
"8912550","8914530"," You just threaten jail, like ten years, automatic."
"8916090","8920090"," Your bank fails due to these reasons, prison."
"8921790","8924110"," As a matter of fact, if you fight it, it's twenty. "
"8924890","8926530"," If you take the ten, it's ten."
"8927510","8928290"," It's very simple."
"8934860","8936240"," But they won't do that, right?"
"8936440","8938040"," Because you got the attorneys and the judges. "
"8938540","8939000"," He's one of them."
"8939160","8940120"," He's one of the bankers, man."
"8940780","8941460"," He's not going to do that. "
"8943520","8949600"," So you'll likely see regulation of some kind and supervision of some kind, that forces"
"8949600","8956160"," consolidation of mid-sized banks to wealthier bankers."
"8960330","8965490"," As inflation soared last year, Powell accelerated interest rate increases because he and his"
"8965490","8970460"," colleagues in the Fed wanted to stop an inflationary mindset from taking root."
"8971320","8976900"," By February, the Fed had increased rates by 4.5 percentage points in one year. "
"8977740","8979380"," The fastest pace in 40 years."
"8980120","8988120"," Bank supervisors didn't quickly identify how those rates had created a dangerous mismatch between"
"8988120","8993380"," some bank's assets, securities, and loans paying low rates and liabilities."
"8994480","8997300"," Deposits and other bank borrowing with higher rates. "
"8997720","9004040"," In March, those losses triggered a run on SVP, SVP, which had an unusually high concentration of"
"9004040","9005000"," uninsured deposits."
"9005880","9006800"," That's a fucking lie."
"9009360","9010480"," They did know. "
"9011420","9012860"," They did fucking know."
"9013600","9016120"," So them saying they did not know is a fucking lie."
"9016760","9017440"," I want you to know that. "
"9018100","9024480"," The Fed's annual stress tests of banks considered how lenders would withstand severe downturns that"
"9024480","9026240"," would produce significant credit losses."
"9027320","9034700"," But SVB's vulnerability came from misjudging its exposure to losses on securities that had fallen"
"9034700","9041180"," in value due to a rapid rise in interest rates as opposed to loan defaults."
"9041980","9043000"," That's another lie. "
"9044760","9048400"," They were warned in advance of this."
"9049080","9051900"," Other banks took precautions."
"9052660","9060880"," As a matter of fact, banks came out and said, we took precautions when he screamed, we're going to"
"9060880","9061840"," raise interest rates. "
"9065720","9075140"," The Fed's annual stress test, and then what's fascinating about this too, right, is the Fed used to"
"9075140","9078840"," not telegraph increasing rates."
"9080120","9091040"," The whole fucking point of the Fed now telegraphing what they're going to do in advance, you"
"9091040","9101880"," would think that these people would take precautions, but"
"9101880","9102440"," they don't."
"9105770","9109150"," This is crazy shit. "
"9110270","9120040"," Did I see the YouTube"
"9120040","9122700"," channel best evidence video on banking fiasco?"
"9124680","9125720"," Off to watch it."
"9125820","9126640"," Let me write it down."
"9126860","9127620"," I have not seen it. "
"9128160","9129120"," Best evidence."
"9130960","9131540"," I'll watch it."
"9140680","9148320"," Let me read what you're saying right now. "
"9151420","9152220"," Yeah, exactly."
"9152460","9153400"," You know what's crazy too?"
"9153780","9154760"," Beartown's saying it right now."
"9155580","9156760"," That's the other part of this. "
"9156760","9158860"," This thing gets all fucked up here too."
"9159720","9161540"," This is how fucked up shit is."
"9162320","9165400"," You see the Fed step in to rescue. "
"9166740","9168980"," The Fed now rescues regional banks."
"9169760","9170360"," We didn't rescue."
"9171000","9177460"," I'm like, Bullshit man, I'm looking at the TGA, the general account. "
"9178300","9179360"," You can see it right there."
"9179840","9183260"," You can see the money that you took out of the fucking system and you fucking put it back in"
"9183260","9183580"," the system."
"9183800","9184680"," You were warehousing it. "
"9185580","9186780"," I know what they're doing."
"9186920","9191720"," When they can't sell at the auction, they're fucking warehousing for down the road."
"9192040","9197580"," They re-injected some of that money so they can claim they didn't create it, but yet it was"
"9197580","9198160"," warehoused. "
"9198920","9199760"," All right, this shit, you're not."
"9199900","9200520"," This really happened."
"9201180","9207820"," So what's really crazy is this is how a bear got fucked in some ways, right?"
"9208180","9212860"," Because now you know that the hand is there. "
"9212860","9214060"," The foot is there."
"9214240","9215700"," The Fed put is there."
"9218400","9220060"," The fucking Fed put is there. "
"9220300","9225300"," And what's crazy is there's some other fat asshole out there."
"9226500","9229780"," And he's got like real estate, commercial real estate."
"9229940","9233900"," And he's like, he's like, I ain't fucking rent and market rates. "
"9234900","9237640"," If I can't get $100 square foot fuck you."
"9238620","9239760"," I'll just go bankrupt."
"9243540","9245780"," Take your revolving credit and suck it. "
"9245780","9246260"," I ain't doing it."
"9247540","9248620"," I'll just do it again."
"9248840","9249400"," I'll just do it again. "
"9249740","9252200"," I'll build more properties, right?"
"9252800","9253860"," It blows up on kids."
"9254020","9257420"," And all of a sudden when regional banks get saved, they're like, what's that?"
"9258980","9259460"," Right?"
"9260520","9264000"," You got like JB is like fat as fuck over this."
"9264680","9269180"," And then you get GS like, you know, shaking a fucking tin can going. "
"9269780","9273280"," Can I consolidate some commercial real estate for me over here?"
"9274120","9274820"," Can I get some of that?"
"9275260","9276880"," Can I get some of that Fed put action?"
"9278180","9282660"," It's like now we've set up like commercial real estate is like the next one, right?"
"9283380","9288600"," Like commercial real estate is like, if you get these big guys are like, oh man, dude, we're going"
"9288600","9289140"," to do that too."
"9289260","9290600"," We did that to regional banks, dude."
"9290680","9296100"," I want to buy some fucking distressed commercial properties and add that to the banking portfolio. "
"9296840","9299080"," Like we used to never trade the stock market."
"9299660","9300680"," And then what was it?"
"9300840","9303880"," Back in the 80s, we got really active in the stock market, right?"
"9304880","9306220"," In the quest for profit."
"9306840","9309660"," Fuck that all up in 2008, right?"
"9310540","9313140"," And now we need a new revenue stream. "
"9313180","9314580"," So what can we get involved in?"
"9315540","9318540"," BlackRock's like, well, we're building residential properties now."
"9319680","9325460"," Like all these banks are like, we're now landlords for the surfs, you know."
"9327680","9329360"," They do their banking with us. "
"9331940","9333800"," They live in the homes that we own."
"9335040","9338660"," And now we want to own the fucking place they go to work and they're a rat in all day"
"9338660","9338900"," long."
"9339520","9340680"," We're going to own it all at some point. "
"9341440","9342440"," You know, this is true."
"9350650","9351590"," That's what it is, right?"
"9353330","9355930"," It's the consolidation of the commercial real estate market next."
"9357270","9358190"," Who's going to buy it?"
"9359170","9361430"," And then all of a sudden it'll be back to work again, right?"
"9361590","9362350"," No more work from home. "
"9365130","9366190"," It's really wild."
"9366390","9371130"," It's like you've got one landlord and you're just your landlord now changes."
"9371770","9373770"," Or as you had one landlord and I have a new landlord. "
"9375330","9375690"," Yeah."
"9376150","9379090"," Like you've written out a big office building and they're like, you step aside."
"9379730","9381490"," We're going to bring this guy in to be your new landlord. "
"9382990","9385530"," That new guy is likely going to be a large bank."
"9386850","9390490"," And the greedy hands are already out."
"9390730","9391370"," Where you see him on. "
"9391710","9393070"," We've talked about this in spring, right?"
"9393930","9397490"," I remember when this was going on with the regional banks and I was like, man, the next fucking"
"9397490","9399170"," thing is going to be these commercial properties."
"9399790","9401930"," A little bit of coiling right now."
"9401970","9402850"," Be careful out there. "
"9404670","9405650"," Watch this on."
"9406250","9407810"," I'm watching this right now in book map."
"9408410","9410430"," Like very dangerous when we coil like this. "
"9412130","9417870"," So, you know, my point here is that we got fucked, man."
"9418510","9424110"," Like when we got fucked and then, you know, some of these people are just greedy."
"9424370","9426570"," They don't care if you regulate them. "
"9427010","9428250"," I agree with the supervision."
"9428590","9429210"," We need more supervision."
"9429590","9431670"," We need these like the CEOs need to be watched. "
"9433030","9435230"," You know, they knew what was coming."
"9435230","9437590"," It was telegraphed to them that rates were going up."
"9437890","9439210"," They knew they were exposed. "
"9440970","9442970"," And these guys are like, let me explain."
"9443230","9447590"," SBB man is like giving fucking loans to startups."
"9449130","9451350"," This is like eighth grade fucking economics. "
"9452510","9453850"," You're raising fucking rates."
"9454130","9454650"," I'm swearing again."
"9454930","9456090"," You're raising fucking rates. "
"9456710","9461870"," You're trying to stop or retard the growth out there, right?"
"9463370","9467150"," You're trying to stop startups like a phase of startups growing."
"9467710","9469430"," You want to retard the growth of that."
"9469870","9471730"," You want to slow that down, right?"
"9472170","9473410"," The end of a short term death cycle. "
"9473410","9474330"," That's what you're attempting to do."
"9474530","9478210"," These fucking banks are telling me don't know that that was going to be the end result."
"9479750","9481110"," It's insane insanity. "
"9481530","9483370"," This article right here is lying to you."
"9483950","9486610"," And I like Nick Temeros, but this is bullshit here."
"9487730","9495990"," So the bank runs and failures of 2023 were painful reminders that we cannot predict all the"
"9495990","9498830"," stresses that will inevitably come from time and chance. "
"9499550","9501390"," Powell said, and here's another note too."
"9501810","9506650"," You also see some of these people like the Bill Ackman's out there."
"9507010","9511710"," They they they are intentionally causing this fire. "
"9512070","9513530"," There's a whole bunch of shit here."
"9513830","9514630"," Talk about like."
"9515610","9519790"," There are people that will benefit from stoking those flames, right?"
"9520610","9526350"," You just saw Elon Musk out there what two weeks ago just stoking the flames of commercial real"
"9526350","9526690"," estate. "
"9526950","9529930"," But there's another fascinating part of this that you probably don't know."
"9531230","9532970"," There's a business cycle."
"9533650","9537250"," And inside of this business cycle is a whole other thing. "
"9538070","9539710"," This is in the stock market."
"9539990","9541030"," There's a business cycle."
"9541750","9548010"," And there was a short on banks in the beginning of the year because we were coming to the end"
"9548010","9550490"," of the financial cycle, banking cycle. "
"9551410","9555270"," And like the mark and like banking had gone down, but not quite enough."
"9556070","9559690"," But it wasn't like where we have that steep drop off."
"9561450","9565970"," So you kind of have to manufacture a crisis. "
"9567290","9571170"," So you get that blood in financials."
"9573590","9576550"," And fascinatingly enough, guess what's the next."
"9578010","9579710"," Part of the business cycle. "
"9581090","9581830"," That's ending."
"9582130","9582390"," Do you know?"
"9582770","9583890"," Last one was financials."
"9583950","9584570"," Do you know what the next one is?"
"9584870","9585550"," Someone tell me in check. "
"9585790","9587310"," I've told you guys what it is."
"9589290","9593610"," What's the next one that we should have a crisis in and we should solve it."
"9594230","9596510"," The Fed's telling you they're going to solve it already. "
"9597050","9598410"," We should look forward to that."
"9598510","9601370"," There should be a short on that sector."
"9602330","9606630"," We talk about it all the time. "
"9610930","9613830"," So like you got Powell saying this was unexpected."
"9614910","9621710"," You got like banks just short financials knowing that we're coming into the time when we have a"
"9621710","9623490"," financial crisis in banks."
"9624690","9630010"," You've got like these all these regional banks are like heavily shorted since like January. "
"9630830","9631210"," Right?"
"9632290","9634170"," And we have the next crisis."
"9634490","9635350"," We can kind of predict that."
"9635510","9638530"," We can kind of say this is what you expect next. "
"9639030","9640550"," I've shown it to you in the show before."
"9641750","9642650"," So whatever."
"9643830","9645270"," So this is all bullshit. "
"9645610","9651210"," The Fed raises interest rates most recently and made a range of between five and five point two"
"9651210","9651550"," percent."
"9651550","9652590"," A sixteen year high."
"9653990","9658050"," Powell has signaled that officials are prepared to raise rates at the feds July. "
"9658950","9660970"," Twenty five twenty six meeting."
"9661870","9662150"," Okay."
"9662370","9664770"," So I want you to know out there if you don't already know. "
"9665610","9671970"," That Powell has signaled to expect a rate hike at the July twenty fifth twenty six meeting."
"9673110","9676690"," After holding them steady at their meeting earlier this month."
"9680140","9684540"," My assumption here that I've said to you in the past is. "
"9685760","9690780"," They're likely waiting for a commercial real estate crisis this summer."
"9691400","9693200"," That they're going to wait and see."
"9693480","9698000"," A monetary policy has only recently moved into restrictive territory. "
"9698480","9699480"," Inflation should cool."
"9699700","9702020"," Even if the Fed leaves the current policy in place."
"9702020","9707780"," I do not see the Fed rate cuts in twenty twenty three or twenty twenty four. "
"9708280","9711000"," We are not ready to rule out further rate hikes if needed."
"9713720","9715220"," There'll be a wait and see."
"9717640","9720140"," If anything happens with that right. "
"9720580","9724340"," I expect the Fed can meet inflation go without causing a severe downturn."
"9724980","9728800"," And inflation is in a gradual crew cooling trend that should continue."
"9728800","9732780"," The Fed policy in place is to bring inflation back to two percent target. "
"9734620","9735660"," So you have."
"9737240","9740740"," We have the Fed raising rates on the twenty fifth twenty six."
"9740820","9741480"," That's the expectation. "
"9742320","9745500"," You have commercial real estate concerns in the background."
"9746120","9748220"," If we have a commercial real estate crisis."
"9749020","9750480"," You don't want to be raising rates. "
"9751060","9751160"," Right."
"9751920","9754680"," You don't want to be like okay we're flooding the system with money."
"9754880","9755420"," We're raising rates. "
"9755420","9757160"," We got some doom over here."
"9757540","9759580"," We have to deal with this summer."
"9761180","9767440"," So keep that on your radar as summer progresses as that story develops. "
"9768100","9772880"," You heard the ruminations of it begin about two months ago right."
"9773340","9776440"," And they've owned that drumbeat has grown louder as we've headed into summer."
"9777260","9778900"," So you have commercial real estate concerns. "
"9779320","9783720"," We've got a possible rate hike in July."
"9783720","9786320"," Does that ever materialize or not?"
"9786720","9788180"," If it doesn't materialize."
"9788540","9791360"," We expect a rate hike in July twenty five twenty six. "
"9792660","9794060"," If that doesn't happen."
"9794140","9794640"," Yeah, fuck it."
"9794900","9795440"," They're raising again. "
"9795780","9796640"," And personally."
"9797500","9799380"," I want to see rates get above the rate of inflation."
"9800180","9801180"," That's where I want to see them. "
"9801840","9804360"," And I want to see them held there for a period of time."
"9805100","9808240"," I don't like seeing inflation where it is right now bothers me."
"9808520","9811760"," It's very concerning to me to see how high inflation is. "
"9811760","9813100"," People are still working."
"9813500","9814640"," We're in this Goldilocks zone."
"9814760","9815320"," I like all that. "
"9815760","9817000"," People are working their asses off."
"9817160","9817700"," They're paying their bills."
"9817880","9818500"," People are out and about. "
"9819900","9820920"," So I like all that."
"9821160","9822740"," Like it's I don't see anything out there."
"9823040","9825060"," My own experience where people are getting torched. "
"9825860","9828840"," They're struggling, but they're not getting torched."
"9830020","9834800"," So I think we continue holding rates and continue to raise them would be good."
"9836040","9840780"," And it's a palisette regulator swift response to the initial crisis as limited risk of contagion. "
"9841600","9843380"," We know that that happened, right?"
"9843540","9844380"," We saw the Fed put."
"9846100","9851040"," As Paul said, regulator swift response to the initial crisis had limited risk of contagion."
"9851640","9856740"," And he said strains in the banking system appeared to have eased in recent weeks with the positive"
"9856740","9858440"," levels showing greater stability. "
"9859040","9866260"," Still, Paul said officials had to learn new lessons about the speed with which banks run could runs"
"9866260","9867340"," could materialize."
"9867820","9873260"," SVB failed less than two days after disclosing it was seeking new sources of funding."
"9873880","9874880"," That's also fascinating. "
"9875440","9882640"," If you ever ever see a bank publicly announcing that they're seeking new sources of funding, we"
"9882640","9883840"," know what happened, what happens."
"9884400","9888140"," If you don't know, if you're young and don't know, usually really bad fucking things."
"9888720","9891300"," So that is what happened in 2008. "
"9891980","9900080"," We had large banks going public looking for funding, like literally pan handling on the side of the"
"9900080","9902600"," street on CNBC of all places."
"9904300","9905000"," Pan handling."
"9905260","9906000"," You never want to see that. "
"9906260","9912860"," If you ever see like JPM GS, you name it out there pan handling any of the big, like big"
"9912860","9916060"," international banks, like you don't want to see that shit."
"9916920","9917880"," Very dangerous."
"9923740","9928760"," When SVB failed, it was clear that a number of standard assumptions, even though they were informed"
"9928760","9931460"," by hard experience, were wrong, he said. "
"9932560","9939200"," Nobody, notably, bank runs were no longer a matter of days or weeks, but now be nearly"
"9939200","9939760"," instantaneous."
"9941340","9943760"," That's written from Nick Timrose."
"9944600","9946740"," And that's the part we discussed earlier. "
"9946960","9951280"," That's the part where you get the Ackmans out there trying to fan the fucking flames of this."
"9951680","9953060"," You get hedge funds trying to fit."
"9953260","9956400"," You get people that are short this that want to fan the flames. "
"9956960","9964320"," You found out afterwards that Jamie Dimon, Bill fucking Ackman, and fucking, what's her name?"
"9966460","9968340"," Fucking what's her name from the Treasury Department."
"9968940","9969720"," I shit you not."
"9970340","9972040"," We're eating dinner together. "
"9972660","9977040"," New Yorker put a piece out about it, or an op-ed piece in the New York Times, and they"
"9977040","9980740"," fucking were talking about these guys, they were all having fucking dinner about this."
"9986080","9991300"," Like the waiter comes up and is like, which regional bank would you like to eat tonight this"
"9991300","9991620"," evening?"
"9994840","9996700"," Yeah, Janet fucking yelling, man."
"9997080","9998420"," She was the other one that was there. "
"9999260","10000720"," They're all fucking partying."
"10002220","10003860"," They're all fucking in on it."
"10007060","10011440"," He got Jeremy saying some shit like, we never expected this. "
"10011580","10013100"," I'm like, that's bullshit too."
"10014120","10016240"," You were tacitly involved in it."
"10018280","10019820"," That's the fucking truth, man. "
"10025680","10027480"," They were fucking having dinner."
"10030280","10032320"," That's like fucking you and I having dinner."
"10033020","10041560"," That's like, um, I don't know. "
"10041660","10050790"," You're planning related to something, but it's like, it's kind of like, um, I don't know."
"10050790","10053390"," You, uh, your parents go away in vacation."
"10053590","10056370"," You have a raging party, right?"
"10056590","10061650"," And you come home after the rage or like a day later and your parents are sitting down. "
"10063050","10069530"," Uh, maybe you've got like the neighbors sitting there and you walk in the room and they're all"
"10069530","10072730"," sitting there and you, and you're like, shit, I'm caught."
"10076670","10080070"," Yeah, maybe that's a better way to say it."
"10080070","10080990"," It's Batman and the Joker. "
"10081870","10082590"," Like, I don't know."
"10082850","10084170"," Like, it's so stupid."
"10084450","10088010"," Like, in the way they play it off publicly, the way they, what they're feeding to you. "
"10088670","10089630"," What does all that mean?"
"10121330","10122250"," It's really bizarre."
"10123790","10125130"," So that was on Nick Tamarose."
"10125370","10126430"," He's the Fed Whisper. "
"10127250","10129370"," Uh, what, what I would take away from this."
"10129370","10132350"," There's some key points to take away from that article."
"10133150","10138090"," Uh, they do offer some insight, a greening of what to expect. "
"10138090","10144990"," So, uh, I would say to you, if you're short commercial real estate, it could be a violent move"
"10144990","10145370"," down."
"10146090","10149770"," If there is a move down another, like, no, it's already, no, it's already down."
"10150890","10154970"," But if there is a quick move down for, uh, commercial real estate could be fast. "
"10154970","10158770"," Just wake up one morning, poof."
"10159530","10160510"," And we've got a crisis."
"10162030","10165090"," I think that story is telling you that, that that can happen. "
"10165390","10166190"," That risk is there."
"10167390","10176030"," Uh, I think also that it's telling you to expect the Fed to inject itself into any of those crisis"
"10176030","10179950"," is as we go through the business cycle."
"10180850","10185270"," Until we get to the structural cycle next year. "
"10186030","10189970"," So if you, uh, read that article I gave to you about China."
"10191210","10196630"," Drunken Miller went out there and he said, he made some commentary that was insightful."
"10197730","10202270"," He was discussing China and he said, people were asking about China and he said, look. "
"10202830","10207430"," He said China is in the middle of a business cycle trade in their markets."
"10207430","10212790"," Uh, they have structural problems with their stock market."
"10213250","10217510"," They have, well, not their stock market, they have structural problems with their economy that will"
"10217510","10223410"," rear its ugly head next year until they get through trading this business cycle. "
"10224010","10227790"," I personally feel as though our market is very similar."
"10228410","10231970"," We have structural issues with our economy."
"10232710","10235270"," And right now they're working on those things. "
"10235270","10238330"," So you have like surgeons are in there working on those things."
"10238850","10241050"," While they're working on those things, try to keep this simple."
"10241350","10243030"," While they're, while they're working on those things. "
"10244010","10251310"," Uh, the stock market is going through a, uh, cyclical trade, a business cycle trade right now."
"10251970","10254850"," And once that business cycle trade is done."
"10255390","10263290"," We're going to revisit the structural problems that we have in our economy, which we do. "
"10263290","10268390"," I admit that we still have structural issues inside of our economy."
"10268630","10271170"," I admit that they're going to try to soften it."
"10272290","10276730"," Uh, and I also think that their best time passes the lows that you've seen. "
"10276870","10279930"," We probably won't go back to revisit those unless there's fraud."
"10281150","10285050"," Um, and they're going to try to, they're going to try to make this market go like a nice, soft,"
"10285190","10287310"," roundish, time-based crash."
"10288970","10292950"," Uh, meanwhile, the market will trade to the side. "
"10292950","10296050"," And up like it has in previous cycles like this."
"10296230","10298530"," We can reference some parts in history."
"10299550","10303450"," 1950s, 60s and 70s, uh, look like that to some extent. "
"10304390","10308330"," There are some people out there, including myself, that see the window to the upside."
"10308930","10313650"," The failure of an all-time high or even all-time high is big ones."
"10313650","10318090"," Association of Investment Managers, annual dinner, followed by a conversation with Sky News"
"10318090","10324050"," Journalist, Common, as an audience Q&A is not expected, but a media Q&A is before the event begins. "
"10325890","10331710"," Now, can we trade that cycle to a failure of all-time highs like just before, maybe?"
"10332130","10332610"," Yes."
"10333790","10336190"," Uh, what our market is structured for right now, we can trade that."
"10336990","10340470"," Uh, can we trade the blow off top like we did in the tech?"
"10341070","10345790"," Uh, boom, our bust in the 2000s, yes, we can. "
"10346530","10350710"," Um, we're, we're, we're poised for both of those trades right now."
"10351070","10354630"," The market is set up right now for both of those trades to take place."
"10355390","10358270"," Uh, either of those two trades, we're poised for it. "
"10358550","10367010"," Is the market positioned or structured right now to, uh, revert back to, uh, rolling over and"
"10367010","10369010"," crashing like 2008?"
"10369010","10370010"," No."
"10370910","10377410"," Uh, if it does, though, position itself for that, I will warn you of it."
"10377750","10380830"," I have three ways to see that warning. "
"10381410","10387230"," If that warning presents itself, I will, that moment tell you I actually have an alert."
"10387970","10397890"," Uh, two alerts that, um, alert me to say, Hey, man, the market could suffer, uh, not only a crash,"
"10397890","10401410"," but it tells me how deep that crash will go."
"10403030","10404550"," Uh, we'll be a normal crash. "
"10404610","10405390"," We'll be a correction."
"10405990","10406970"," We'll be corrective."
"10407510","10409230"," We'll be, so we'll, we'll be corrective. "
"10409270","10409890"," We'll be a crash."
"10410430","10413750"," Will it be a fraud based crash to the depths of hell?"
"10414490","10416670"," Well, matter of fact, I just finished that tool."
"10417990","10422110"," Uh, recently for the tools not finished, the math is finished. "
"10423210","10425270"," Uh, for it."
"10425270","10427470"," So you guys will get out those alerts at some point."
"10428170","10431290"," Uh, you'll get them in the discord, I think, or some more on the website, you'll get them. "
"10431890","10436730"," When they, when they, uh, present themselves and when they, when they actually alleviate too."
"10437310","10439430"," When the risk of that happening, even if we don't."
"10439830","10445190"," The coolest part about this tool is that, uh, once it, once it, um, alerts, it's like, okay. "
"10446110","10450710"," We're in very, very high risk right now of a major crash, like, uh, 2008 style."
"10450710","10454870"," Uh, this depends on examples in history where it's, where it's, uh, triggered."
"10455570","10456950"," And we have crashed like that. "
"10457690","10462750"," Uh, there are some other examples in history where that we were near one of those and it didn't"
"10462750","10463070"," happen."
"10463490","10468790"," But as soon as it didn't happen and the risk, uh, went away, there's a second alert that tells you"
"10468790","10469790"," that risk is gone."
"10470710","10471990"," Uh, so that's pretty cool too. "
"10472670","10474350"," I think a two part, uh, two part thing."
"10478950","10481790"," Nothing that I can see, uh, honestly, nothing."
"10481790","10487310"," The only things that I see here are right now, the only thing that's presenting themselves is, uh,"
"10487430","10491090"," trades down to the daily trigger and the weekly trigger. "
"10491310","10491670"," That's it."
"10492270","10495030"," So I would expect, uh, nine for this year."
"10495130","10502390"," I'm going to expect, uh, eight to nine dip buys on the yellow line and two to three buys on"
"10502390","10503410"," the orange line. "
"10503990","10508050"," Right now nothing is showing, uh, anything else."
"10508410","10509830"," Uh, and we'll get fair warning."
"10509830","10513530"," We'll get like a, I'll get, you'll get like a, hey, it's time. "
"10514370","10520530"," Uh, you like or in most scenarios, you're going to get a, uh, in the next one to three months,"
"10520530","10521570"," we're going to roll the market over."
"10523070","10528310"," Uh, and then you'll get, I'll get a second alert that says, um, here comes the role."
"10528870","10529710"," Great when it's happening. "
"10531390","10534930"," Uh, and then I get a third alert that says when it's the risk is over."
"10540960","10542260"," And some of you know this."
"10542940","10547820"," Some, there's actually some of you out there that know all about this and how I get those things. "
"10548000","10548480"," Some of you don't know."
"10548660","10549180"," Some of you do know."
"10554490","10556690"," We have videos saying we're going to roll over too. "
"10556830","10557510"," I don't know if you know that."
"10557910","10558270"," We're on rock."
"10558550","10559710"," We've, we've got them. "
"10560210","10561910"," We made the videos talking about the role."
"10561930","10565010"," So before the, before it happened, we're on record."
"10568410","10569150"," We're on record. "
"10569750","10570410"," We're on record."
"10570410","10571110"," We've got James Rowan."
"10571190","10572070"," He knows a lot about this too. "
"10572330","10572810"," You'll find him."
"10574650","10578890"," Ask him about when we're at the bottoms in June and October and in May."
"10579570","10581170"," He likes to tell people the story. "
"10581290","10581910"," It's a great story."
"10587390","10589970"," It's like a really kick-ass story, believe it or not."
"10595430","10596930"," That's 3 p.m. Eastern time. "
"10597090","10601950"," We expect comments from feds."
"10601950","10604410"," Who gives a speech on US economic outlook."
"10604490","10605370"," Janet Bellen. "
"10606210","10606650"," Yeah."
"10606770","10607650"," Janet Bellen, dude."
"10608370","10610650"," My conversation with Sky News journalist Coleman. "
"10611710","10612490"," Where are we finishing?"
"10613650","10616090"," My take here is that we're, we're mooning."
"10616730","10617850"," I would, how about this?"
"10619170","10621110"," So my take, I want you want my take."
"10621290","10622750"," I talked about this at the beginning this morning. "
"10622770","10623570"," I'll talk about it again."
"10623730","10623890"," Okay."
"10624110","10625150"," Before the event begins. "
"10625750","10626530"," I'll talk about right now."
"10626710","10627310"," What I think."
"10627950","10629870"," So we are going. "
"10631310","10635230"," We are going up from now into from morning from 8 30 this morning."
"10635730","10636610"," We're going up."
"10638170","10639490"," Into tomorrow's close. "
"10640170","10640550"," Being Bell."
"10641270","10646310"," The only thing that would thwart that would be whatever the JPM caller is."
"10646650","10648190"," So I think that I can see that. "
"10648770","10649990"," With that from happening."
"10651070","10654090"," So my bias here is to the upside."
"10654550","10655370"," And to Friday close. "
"10655950","10657350"," For a multitude of reasons."
"10657350","10659130"," One of the big ones would be."
"10661070","10664030"," Those, those hedging flows that are coming in tomorrow. "
"10665650","10670210"," They are always, always followed with."
"10670950","10673530"," A ship ton of zero day calls like waterfall."
"10674570","10677450"," Zero day calls and they print those end of day. "
"10677550","10679710"," It's like a nice little treat for the banks."
"10680850","10683970"," The only thing that could thwart that from my perspective would be."
"10686010","10687310"," A sentiment shift. "
"10688750","10691150"," By lower strikes on a JPM caller."
"10691310","10692250"," It's the only thing that I can see."
"10693710","10695290"," That could thwart that from happening. "
"10697270","10700490"," So this is a mechanical function of quarter quarter end."
"10700990","10702310"," You can say what a fuck you want."
"10702510","10703790"," I know what happens in quarter end. "
"10703970","10706090"," So I know what the stats are."
"10707950","10710550"," And the stats say we close on the high tomorrow."
"10711290","10713950"," That, that closing fucking number tomorrow is going to matter. "
"10714950","10715950"," Most of the time."
"10717730","10720830"," What the times when it doesn't matter is when those strikes come out."
"10720930","10721750"," We can cause panic. "
"10723570","10724790"," So if we cause panic."
"10725750","10726030"," You'll know."
"10726570","10727750"," People will be unfinted to it. "
"10727830","10729530"," They'll be like, oh shit."
"10730310","10731470"," We got lower strikes."
"10733270","10734730"," JPM's lower strike is 2,800. "
"10735550","10736770"," You see some shit like that, dude."
"10736930","10738770"," People are going to be like, give me that on the fucking market right now."
"10741970","10743650"," Because as a matter of fact, if they do. "
"10744190","10746130"," As a matter of fact, if they come out with lower strikes."
"10747150","10750910"," I'm going to then look for a pretty severe correction to come in the in Q three."
"10752670","10754250"," This sets up my whole quarter. "
"10755230","10757110"," Well, you guys are trying to trade the end of quarter."
"10757450","10758230"," I'm done, man."
"10758330","10758630"," I'm out. "
"10758930","10760910"," Like I've got some I got some investment shit, but."
"10761370","10764390"," Like my stock buying is all has been wrapped up for weeks now."
"10765290","10766430"," My fucking I'm done. "
"10766630","10766870"," I'm out."
"10767150","10768090"," I'm out of the entire market."
"10768090","10768930"," I'm day trading it. "
"10770790","10773750"," This I usually take this week off like last like this week."
"10773830","10775290"," I'm off like I'm done."
"10775610","10777290"," I'm so fucking burned right now. "
"10777530","10779130"," Like every quarter at the end."
"10779250","10779950"," I'm like, fuck this."
"10780170","10780410"," I'm out. "
"10780910","10784950"," If I was an investor, I wouldn't be doing shit for the next two weeks."
"10786610","10790070"," Like this is this whole two weeks is meant for one thing."
"10790830","10794190"," For banks to wrap up their positioning. "
"10794630","10795730"," Do some window dressing."
"10796570","10797930"," Take their money and run."
"10798650","10800090"," Reposition for the next quarter. "
"10800230","10801770"," A whole ton of you watching right now, right?"
"10802570","10806070"," Don't realize that this next quarter."
"10806990","10809790"," I will position myself for the entire quarter."
"10810510","10812390"," With along with a lot of people here. "
"10813530","10816670"," You will watch that whole quarter play out."
"10817510","10821110"," And you will enter the market to the last two weeks as we're done."
"10821790","10824230"," I understand that that's what happens with most people. "
"10825670","10826870"," I understand it."
"10827690","10828830"," But we don't do that."
"10829090","10831230"," We'll be expecting comments from Fed's Bostek. "
"10832130","10833910"," And you'll chase at the entire quarter."
"10835070","10837050"," Or you'll not the entire the end of the quarter."
"10837050","10837530"," You'll chase. "
"10837810","10838290"," We don't do that."
"10838430","10839490"," We're like done by end of quarter."
"10840190","10840450"," So. "
"10841890","10845090"," So for me, at least I'm I'm fascinated by what happens."
"10846550","10848410"," We don't have to trade the JPM caller."
"10848710","10850010"," There's a whole bunch of mechanics behind it. "
"10850010","10852150"," But I'm interested to see what their thoughts are."
"10852150","10859550"," When you hear like Jamie come out or Mike Wilson or these people, you may or may not know this,"
"10859670","10862210"," but I invest with JPM."
"10863630","10866210"," So I get letters from them. "
"10866410","10867170"," They talk to me."
"10867610","10868470"," They talk to investors."
"10869090","10870830"," They're like, hey, we think this is going to happen. "
"10871550","10874090"," And that's a completely different fucking story than what they're telling you."
"10874590","10877870"," When they're out there saying we have risk of this and we have risk of that."
"10878890","10880650"," As an investor, they tell you different shit. "
"10881710","10885270"," When they hedge, it's a different thing than what they're positioned for."
"10885450","10886690"," Or it's different than what they say publicly."
"10887490","10889930"," So you're one of your insightful things that you can do. "
"10891330","10894990"," Is have been investor with one of these banks, one of these prime banks."
"10895750","10899510"," Another insightful thing that you can do is see what their actual positioning is."
"10899830","10901510"," You don't have many opportunities to see that. "
"10902170","10906070"," JPM caller is one of those insightful things that you can see."
"10907150","10910230"," If those guys really did suck at what they do, they'd be fucking bankrupt."
"10910570","10912210"," They're fucking really good at what they do. "
"10912850","10913670"," It's their market."
"10914110","10916230"," They are really fucking good at it."
"10917990","10919730"," So I want to know what they're doing. "
"10920690","10922830"," I want to know what the fuck they're doing."
"10923770","10925370"," And that's one of the ways for me to see it."
"10925490","10926450"," So I'm fascinated by it. "
"10927810","10930710"," If they think we're going to the depths of hell, they're going to position for it."
"10932630","10934510"," And they're usually pretty close, right?"
"10934810","10936050"," Pretty fucking close."
"10937170","10939990"," They do a pretty good job most of the time. "
"10947820","10950300"," Yeah, that's why I haven't sold them."
"10950800","10952760"," It's like yesterday I was trying to prove a point in this meeting."
"10953120","10955040"," And I'm trying to prove a point right now too. "
"10955600","10957780"," So I'm still in calls."
"10958320","10960900"," I bought them for tomorrow and not today because it wasn't day trading."
"10961720","10963080"," I'm not buying zero dates this morning. "
"10963240","10966360"," If I bought zero dates this morning, I would have exited every one of these rips."
"10967000","10969680"," So I'm trying not to do that right now."
"10969780","10971900"," I'm trying to just buy a fucking weekly. "
"10972620","10974480"," Two days left in the start of the day."
"10975500","10977280"," My bias is to the upside."
"10978080","10978900"," Into tomorrow's close. "
"10979320","10981020"," I want to see what they what they print."
"10982880","10985760"," This is a function of a test."
"11004230","11005630"," So I sat in office. "
"11006150","11015370"," My what so how it all brought about was my wife, of course, we banked at different banks and they"
"11015370","11017670"," find out how much you're worth."
"11019170","11021890"," When they find out how much you're worth, they talk to you."
"11021990","11022710"," You want to tell you what happens?"
"11023450","11024550"," They talk to your fucking wife. "
"11026630","11028750"," And there's like a fucking office full of them."
"11028990","11029870"," Every city has one."
"11030030","11031010"," Every town has one. "
"11031010","11032510"," And they fucking in the back room."
"11032510","11034610"," It wasn't a back room, but like there's a back office space."
"11035230","11036990"," And there's a bunch of fucking boys back there. "
"11037370","11042610"," And they try to talk your wife into bringing your money to bring them to your money."
"11043450","11046470"," And so then your wife comes home and she fucking says some shit to you."
"11046510","11047970"," And I say, fuck those guys. "
"11049250","11052770"," And they do it again and again and again and again and again."
"11053350","11055630"," And eventually you show up and you're like, all right, what's going on?"
"11059170","11062150"," And they're like, how do you manage your money?"
"11063070","11065890"," So I go, you don't want to know."
"11068210","11070770"," You can probably see the money coming in and out of my account. "
"11071590","11074310"," Like sometimes they got to sometimes they got to like call the bank."
"11074470","11076430"," And I'm like, I have to like lie to them."
"11076570","11078810"," I'm like, yeah, I'm doing some rehabbing right now. "
"11081310","11084410"," Because I'll be like, I got a lot of money coming in and out of the account right now."
"11084850","11086050"," They don't want that money cut."
"11086210","11088430"," Like they're like, you're looking really suspicious, you know. "
"11088990","11090110"," What are you doing with all this money?"
"11090350","11093010"," Like why do you have like 30,000, 50,000, 100,000?"
"11093890","11095370"," Like they don't want you spending it."
"11095670","11097650"," They don't want you pissing it away and on shit."
"11098030","11100770"," Like if you have a lot of money, right, there's a bunch of shit that happens. "
"11100790","11102650"," Like they don't want you spending it."
"11102970","11104490"," They want you to like use an AMX."
"11104870","11106030"," They definitely don't want you using your card. "
"11107050","11108610"," They don't want you like pissing it away."
"11108910","11111310"," Like we're going to go and fucking spend 20 grand this weekend."
"11111570","11112130"," Just piss it away. "
"11114410","11115790"," That kind of shit they don't like."
"11119710","11122790"," So, and then they know you're fucking around in the stock market."
"11123010","11124390"," So you like, then you bring them. "
"11124730","11129430"," If any guys out there ever brought your fucking trade along to the fucking, to the investment bank"
"11129430","11130990"," and been like, I've done this."
"11131290","11134110"," Like you want to see my, like I printed out and I'm like, here, look at this."
"11136010","11137150"," You want to see the fucked up?"
"11137250","11137610"," Should I do?"
"11141790","11144610"," I'm like, what series, what a series license you got, man. "
"11150410","11151910"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"11152930","11155410"," The accountant say you're the bookkeeper hates you."
"11155610","11157770"," The fucking, dude, investing money. "
"11158070","11158790"," Show those guys."
"11159530","11160530"," Dude, you should see it."
"11160870","11161790"," They gathered around. "
"11162490","11163070"," They shit you not."
"11163230","11164630"," They gathered around the fucking desk."
"11168190","11171030"," My local, my local investment bank was like that. "
"11171130","11172510"," They're like, what the fuck are you doing?"
"11182050","11183050"," It's so fucking true."
"11183150","11183690"," It's so terrible."
"11183750","11185830"," It looks like, it looks like such a fucking idiot. "
"11190310","11194890"," Yeah, a new tax person."
"11195130","11196290"," A couple things for taxes."
"11198430","11203330"," If you have any, if you've ever accumulated any money, okay, I want to tell you something very"
"11203330","11203750"," important. "
"11205990","11208010"," Key, you need two things."
"11209730","11215730"," You must have an attorney that you can make friends with."
"11215730","11217270"," Remember that. "
"11218110","11218890"," Friends."
"11219950","11223570"," And that they're becoming a great attorney."
"11224330","11226010"," You don't want to be higher than attorney. "
"11226750","11232810"," That already has like the bestest firm in your town or anywhere you live or whatever."
"11234460","11240630"," Oh, oh, who's that?"
"11244690","11246970"," Find someone that you can get along with."
"11248910","11250290"," Interview a lot of attorneys. "
"11251150","11254930"," You don't necessarily want, you want to have something in common with them."
"11255550","11257690"," There's a difference between money and friendship."
"11258890","11260470"," Money can buy you anything. "
"11261890","11266470"," Friendship is different because you won't get fucked by these people in life."
"11266830","11269670"," This has to do with your doctor, your attorney."
"11271070","11276450"," It's important for you to, you want to be with someone that can identify with you. "
"11276810","11278270"," Someone that has compassion for you."
"11278690","11279850"," Someone that's not going to fuck you over."
"11280450","11282750"," That kind of stuff is lost today oftentimes. "
"11283610","11287890"," So I always recommend that you get an attorney on retainer."
"11288490","11289510"," You don't need a ton of money."
"11289790","11292850"," A thousand bucks, five thousand bucks, five hundred bucks. "
"11294370","11296870"," Before you ever need one, you just get one."
"11296870","11298030"," Be like, hey, man, I need an attorney."
"11298450","11299470"," Need family counsel. "
"11300730","11306150"," So find yourself an attorney and try to have something in common with them."
"11306370","11307370"," Oh, man, you're raising kids."
"11307370","11307890"," I am too. "
"11308510","11309850"," You went to this school."
"11310050","11310130"," Great."
"11310430","11312850"," We can smile and shake each other's hands. "
"11312990","11313390"," We're relaxed."
"11314190","11316990"," We feel like we're like we like each other."
"11316990","11317710"," That kind of shit. "
"11318110","11318510"," It's important."
"11319430","11322410"," And make that relationship a long-term relationship."
"11324070","11327110"," Years, years, decades grow old with that person. "
"11327410","11329610"," Male, female, I don't care if it's a woman, man, I don't care."
"11330410","11334050"," And seek their counsel in life when you need it."
"11334350","11335410"," It's important to have that in life. "
"11336230","11338270"," They keep you on the straight and narrow so you're not fucking up."
"11338650","11339770"," So you're not making bad decisions."
"11340890","11341830"," That kind of stuff. "
"11342130","11342150"," Okay."
"11342930","11347330"," Now that attorney will likely be able to find you an accountant."
"11347950","11349010"," You don't need an accountant. "
"11350290","11351470"," You can do your own bookkeeping."
"11351470","11354370"," You can pay a bookkeeper cheap money."
"11354690","11355370"," It doesn't cost a lot. "
"11355710","11363670"," But usually, usually a good family or business or general practice attorney will know an"
"11363670","11363990"," accountant."
"11364970","11366330"," An accountant that they trust."
"11368250","11369690"," Attorneys know the good attorneys. "
"11370830","11374390"," As a matter of fact, my last attorney that I got was turned on to me from another attorney."
"11374550","11375890"," It was like, this guy is up and coming."
"11376370","11377070"," You got to meet him. "
"11377570","11378110"," So I met him."
"11378510","11378930"," He's great."
"11380310","11385010"," But your attorney will know a good accountant and you're not going to get taken to the cleaners. "
"11385730","11388950"," You're going to have a bookkeeper do your books for the year."
"11389310","11390670"," You're going to do it yourself."
"11391170","11392710"," You're going to do it at home. "
"11392850","11393970"," You're going to do it with a bookkeeper."
"11394150","11395510"," Bookkeeper is a cheap dude, believe it or not."
"11395730","11396010"," Really cheap. "
"11396610","11397290"," You can go through all your shit."
"11397870","11403050"," And then you bring it for the attorney to look at and certify your taxes for you."
"11404190","11407190"," And make recommendations if you're doing things wrong, not keeping receipts. "
"11407190","11410990"," Maybe you need to start keeping all of receipts and itemizing."
"11410990","11411970"," Maybe you need to create a trust."
"11412510","11414030"," Maybe you need to create an LLC to trade with. "
"11414050","11416410"," There's all kinds of stuff that you might need to be doing."
"11417410","11421110"," But you want to surround yourself with those people because they're going to make a difference for"
"11421110","11421550"," you in life."
"11421790","11423530"," If any tragedy happens, you have an attorney. "
"11425530","11426290"," Mistake happens."
"11427490","11427590"," Someone."
"11427850","11428530"," I don't know. "
"11428690","11429610"," Some bad habit of pool."
"11429850","11430390"," Some bad happens."
"11430770","11431950"," Someone falls off a ladder at your house. "
"11433890","11436250"," Your husband cheats on you and leaves you."
"11436970","11440570"," All kinds of tragic things happen to people in life."
"11441410","11445270"," And so if you have a relationship with these people, they're there for you when you need them. "
"11445730","11448150"," They're not as expensive as you think that they are."
"11448250","11450430"," They're expensive, but they're worth the expense."
"11455610","11457870"," Fuck no, I ain't taking them off the white line. "
"11458350","11459310"," This shit's mooning."
"11459910","11460790"," I don't know if you know that."
"11460910","11461690"," I don't know if I told you that. "
"11461810","11462950"," This shit is fucking mooning."
"11465010","11466410"," Whether you like it or not."
"11467190","11470230"," The only thing stopping this fucking ship is JPM. "
"11473430","11475010"," You guys do whatever you want to do."
"11480370","11481710"," I'm doing what I want to do."
"11487810","11488770"," Yeah, Jill. "
"11489850","11491030"," Meet an attorney."
"11491570","11492970"," It's fascinating too."
"11493110","11494990"," You can usually figure out which ones. "
"11495510","11498690"," You can usually figure out which ones are coming up."
"11498910","11500010"," They're usually about."
"11501150","11503990"," 35 to 40 years old right in that range. "
"11504890","11506710"," They usually have a small practice."
"11506850","11508030"," Two, three attorneys."
"11509670","11511110"," They're probably known. "
"11512030","11513670"," There's a few things you don't want."
"11513910","11515310"," You don't want a large firm."
"11517030","11520530"," You want to negotiate not being billed hourly. "
"11521030","11521810"," It's usually by the job."
"11523210","11526710"," You don't want someone that litigates exclusively."
"11528890","11530110"," There's a reason for that too. "
"11530270","11532610"," You don't want your attorney to be known by every judge."
"11533130","11534610"," Oh fuck, here he comes."
"11536010","11537210"," Clogging up the courts, right?"
"11537330","11538170"," Because there are those attorneys. "
"11538850","11545450"," There are attorneys out there that they lose every fucking case and they are litigators."
"11546110","11548230"," Like you want someone that can find solutions for you."
"11548310","11549690"," Has a record of finding solutions. "
"11550590","11551870"," The best solution for you."
"11552530","11553410"," That kind of stuff."
"11555950","11557410"," And that you can trust. "
"11557850","11559190"," That's a lot of work to find that."
"11559350","11562950"," Usually how you find it is you have to speak to a few attorneys."
"11565570","11567570"," To a few attorneys and ask around. "
"11567830","11569830"," You're like I'm looking for this specific kind of attorney."
"11573680","11576600"," Yeah, he waives friend is that I know there."
"11576880","11577760"," I've had different. "
"11577920","11580540"," I've lived in a lived in different places in the country."
"11580640","11583640"," So I've had to retain attorneys in different places."
"11584780","11586780"," And I've had good ones and bad ones. "
"11587920","11591720"," And the good ones are always like you fucking know it when you find them."
"11592680","11594240"," You fucking know it when you find them."
"11594320","11596660"," Usually it comes down to you have a good relationship with them. "
"11597800","11606040"," If you don't identify with your attorney, if you couldn't get together with them on a weekend."
"11606840","11607620"," Probably not your attorney."
"11608920","11610420"," You couldn't go out and have lunch with them. "
"11610820","11611680"," Probably not your attorney."
"11612680","11614280"," If you couldn't have a Christmas party with them."
"11614480","11615340"," Probably not your attorney. "
"11616400","11620360"," Your attorney should be someone that you could at any time just hang out with."
"11620360","11622080"," Not that you will just that you could."
"11630470","11631250"," That's great Joe. "
"11631730","11632230"," That's what I did."
"11632450","11634330"," I put my money in real estate."
"11634950","11636310"," Best thing I ever fucking did. "
"11637610","11639110"," Best thing I ever fucking did."
"11639430","11640650"," You know the other best thing Jill is?"
"11641650","11643590"," There'll be a point where you won't want to sell that shit."
"11643790","11644270"," Don't sell it. "
"11644810","11645630"," Don't succumb to it."
"11645830","11646470"," Just hold it forever."
"11647790","11649470"," Forever and ever and ever and ever. "
"11649470","11650090"," Never ever sell it."
"11651930","11652450"," Keep it."
"11657010","11658910"," It'll do nothing but benefit you. "
"11660470","11664630"," That's why one of my father's biggest mistakes was selling his real estate."
"11666670","11672750"," I spent like 20, 30 years past and he's like getting out at the top."
"11674410","11676230"," Worst thing he ever fucking did. "
"11680450","11681670"," Just should have kept it."
"11681670","11689570"," It was like that it was like the difference between retiring well off and retiring wealthy."
"11690410","11695130"," It was a vast difference in how he's spending his later years. "
"11695350","11701210"," He does very well in his retirement but not the level that he would have been at if he had"
"11701210","11702030"," kept all those properties."
"11708150","11709270"," I don't know."
"11709410","11712030"," My preferred is to either. "
"11713470","11715030"," Most people start with residential."
"11715850","11720570"," If you're going to sell residential and get out of it, the next step is commercial real estate."
"11721050","11722150"," It's my preferred. "
"11722650","11726430"," If I had a preferred real estate tone, it would be one of two things."
"11726850","11730610"," You either own commercial real estate that is easy to own."
"11731130","11733450"," So you could own a storage unit. "
"11734970","11738570"," If you wanted to run the storage unit, you could but if you didn't want to, it would be easy."
"11738810","11740130"," There's low turnover, right?"
"11741430","11745470"," You want a tenant that stays in for a long, long fucking time."
"11746370","11748550"," You don't want to own a restaurant. "
"11748910","11749730"," So I guess some people do."
"11750370","11756010"," You could own the restaurant if you don't mind dealing with the constant rotation of ownership."
"11757050","11759010"," You can make a lot of money off that stuff too, I guess. "
"11759930","11761890"," But for me, you don't want the headaches at that point."
"11761890","11764030"," When you have that kind of money, you don't need to worry about headaches."
"11764350","11765490"," Or you don't want to worry about it. "
"11765570","11766030"," It's like, fuck it."
"11766290","11767710"," This guy's going to be here 20 fucking years."
"11768310","11769090"," It's regular money. "
"11769330","11769850"," I have a deal with it."
"11769990","11770830"," There's no nightmares."
"11772450","11773530"," They're going to be there forever. "
"11773850","11775070"," That's like the kind of shit you want to own."
"11777490","11778390"," Guaranteed, getting paid."
"11778750","11779030"," Guaranteed. "
"11779250","11779630"," No worries."
"11780070","11780990"," No disasters."
"11781770","11781990"," No nothing. "
"11783530","11784770"," Some people like that though."
"11785150","11786850"," I have real estate friends with what they do."
"11787090","11787530"," This is gross. "
"11787850","11788370"," I don't do this."
"11789270","11790630"," I know people that do this."
"11791230","11792270"," They'll buy a house. "
"11793330","11796810"," And instead of renting it, they sell it on a land contract."
"11797610","11799670"," And then they wait for you to fix it up."
"11800550","11802230"," And then you've missed a payment. "
"11802650","11804010"," And they fucking fuck you."
"11804350","11805830"," They kick your ass to the curb."
"11806310","11807170"," They take the house back. "
"11807410","11808470"," You paid a huge down payment."
"11809430","11810590"," And they pocket that."
"11811190","11812510"," And you fixed up the house. "
"11812730","11814850"," So the next person comes in, they land contract it again."
"11815650","11816990"," They take another huge deposit."
"11817650","11819010"," You care for it like you own it. "
"11819010","11821210"," You missed one payment and you're fucking out."
"11821870","11823010"," So they do that shit."
"11823170","11825790"," But I think that shit to me is like, it's like too much. "
"11826370","11827410"," I don't want to deal with that shit."
"11828230","11829690"," I don't want to deal with any of that shit."
"11830550","11832990"," I think some commercial real estate can be like that too. "
"11834790","11835230"," Ooh."
"11836210","11836650"," Ooh."
"11838790","11840530"," Let me ask you guys a question. "
"11841490","11846510"," Did anyone of any of you out there panic sell your calls earlier today?"
"11846510","11848950"," I want to know."
"11850190","11853510"," Give me your fucking trade-a-log right fucking now."
"11854650","11857910"," Did you panic sell your calls for a loss earlier today?"
"11859070","11862970"," You paper-handed little shit. "
"11872670","11874150"," It's okay Chase balls."
"11874790","11875750"," I love you man."
"11876950","11878230"," Good job admitting it. "
"11878470","11881450"," I love you brother."
"11896240","11897720"," G square right on brother."
"11897940","11898860"," I had a friend do it yesterday. "
"11899200","11900820"," Or had a guy in a meeting do it yesterday brother."
"11901240","11901980"," He panicked sold."
"11904240","11906860"," He was like his hand was in the cookie jar. "
"11907160","11909820"," We were all sitting there and I'm like you didn't sell your calls right?"
"11909980","11911400"," And he's like fuck."
"11917610","11918810"," Right on a panic bot."
"11926470","11927170"," Public shame. "
"11937000","11940920"," Yeah I could have managed my trade better but I'm fascinated by this next two days."
"11941400","11944240"," I don't have zero dates so I'm not as concerned with the theta."
"11945580","11946640"," They're burning me right now. "
"11946760","11948040"," I'm at 28 cents right now."
"11948140","11952040"," They're trying to torch my theta but I want to see if it prints like 300%."
"11952960","11955860"," I was up I think 110% or something. "
"11956720","11958680"," I'm like nah I want to stay in for the full three."
"11959460","11959800"," Let them ride."
"11961020","11963400"," I want my 300% give it to me. "
"11966660","11967960"," It's like a test here."
"11968060","11971600"," It's like a yesterday we had some calls print like two and three hundred percent."
"11971600","11973400"," So I'm like I want to see if we can do that again. "
"11982770","11983870"," Next time I'll be streaming."
"11984210","11985350"," So how about this?"
"11985530","11986030"," It's a good question."

"12185720","12189240"," It might be Eric Nam again is coming to town in October or something."
"12189240","12192340"," And then they have another concert coming up next couple weeks."
"12192380","12193360"," I got a calendar. "
"12193460","12195180"," I'll break the calendar out of shit that I'm doing for them."
"12196160","12196860"," That's all based."
"12197120","12199760"," The only reason why I have this stuff planned for them is because I know you guys support the"
"12199760","12200240"," stream. "
"12200640","12203660"," So I want to say thank you very much for supporting the stream."
"12205480","12207000"," I will go over tomorrow."
"12207200","12211340"," I'm going to go over any of the PayPal Donators names tomorrow in the morning. "
"12212160","12214760"," So tomorrow will be the day that I go over everyone that's donated."
"12215380","12220000"," So that I can share a praise upon you if especially they don't see it right now."
"12220300","12222020"," Sometimes they don't see the people support the stream. "
"12222560","12225060"," I want to say thanks a young trader dude."
"12225100","12225920"," I love you man."

"12336620","12337400"," Right now."
"12338800","12339680"," Let's look at tomorrow. "
"12340060","12341780"," Let's take a look at what we're going to expect for tomorrow."
"12342520","12342880"," Okay."
"12343080","12344300"," So we're going to talk about something here. "
"12345200","12346680"," We're going to look at Q."
"12347540","12347960"," One."
"12349620","12352160"," Do we always trade like we did the last quarter?"
"12352400","12352540"," No."
"12352540","12354260"," But let's look at Q."
"12354560","12354580"," One. "
"12354880","12363260"," Because what happened last quarter was we had higher strikes on the JPM collar."
"12363800","12365400"," Nobody wanted to talk about that."
"12366340","12368420"," They got real quiet on Fintuit. "
"12369040","12370500"," I assure you it did."
"12371080","12372100"," People are like, no, it didn't."
"12372160","12372900"," I'm like, yes, it did. "
"12373600","12377160"," They got real fucking quiet for a minute on Fintuit."
"12377500","12378800"," Nobody wanted to discuss it."
"12378800","12386760"," I don't blame them for not wanting to discuss it because people's viewpoints are one that those"
"12386760","12388500"," strikes would be the same or lower. "
"12390040","12395320"," And their market outlook was very negative."
"12396260","12397140"," Neutral to negative."
"12398020","12404300"," So when you see something that's contrary to your viewpoints, you have to adjust what you think"
"12404300","12404900"," might happen. "
"12405620","12407320"," And that's not an easy thing, right?"
"12407320","12414160"," So let's look back on the end of Q1."
"12414440","12420720"," Let's go look back on March, the end of March."
"12421060","12429000"," This is March 28th, 29th, and the 30th and 31st. "
"12430060","12431780"," And what happens here?"
"12432940","12435040"," You got a midday low, right?"
"12435040","12436740"," Had that today, didn't we?"
"12437680","12440480"," That midday low got bought right up into the clothes."
"12442700","12444620"," What happened into the 31st?"
"12445180","12450160"," We drift it up and then we exploded to the upside."
"12452860","12459000"," So to counter these hedging flows, these are bearish bets in the market. "
"12460140","12463820"," Banks put a ton of zero calls, zero date calls in the market."
"12463820","12466540"," We also have window dressing."
"12467300","12470820"," We also have beaten down tickers out there. "
"12471000","12477180"," So if you know of any, let's just say you just pretend that today you got on the internet and"
"12477180","12480660"," you looked back on tickers that were beaten down for an entire quarter."
"12481020","12481920"," Guess what might happen?"
"12482700","12483460"," Do you want me to tell you?"
"12484280","12485060"," Two things."
"12486020","12490260"," They will try to show some profit for these investments. "
"12490260","12495160"," Or if there's short these investments, let's say I'm short an entire quarter."
"12495420","12498600"," I'm like, I've been pounding this fucking ticker down for three fucking months."
"12498860","12501080"," I fucking sold this thing down to the depths of hell. "
"12502320","12503660"," What are you going to do for next quarter?"
"12503820","12505620"," I'm going to short it down to the fucking depths of hell again."
"12505840","12506000"," Really?"
"12506360","12507240"," Okay, so from where?"
"12507460","12507720"," Right here?"
"12508120","12512460"," No, I'm going to take my shorts off this fucking thing and let it breathe from some air."
"12513940","12515900"," I'm going to slam this thing back down again. "
"12516580","12517140"," What are you doing it?"
"12517960","12519040"," Likely end of quarter."
"12519520","12520180"," Oh, really?"
"12520540","12520880"," Oh, okay."
"12521200","12525320"," So if you were to run a scan maybe on some of those tickers, there might be a small window"
"12526560","12527720"," where these things go. "
"12531060","12532880"," So we see what this is."
"12533120","12534980"," We see what happens into the new week."
"12536340","12537480"," And then they sell it, right?"
"12538720","12540800"," This is the we have a weekend here. "
"12541780","12543280"," We reopen on the fourth."
"12544260","12545160"," And they sell the open."
"12547740","12548560"," See it right here?"
"12549140","12549700"," We have a look. "
"12549860","12550240"," We're in here."
"12550340","12552100"," We have a party time on Monday, right?"
"12552340","12552800"," Party time?"
"12553800","12555600"," Party time on Tuesday and then boom."
"12555800","12557000"," They sell it as soon as we come back. "
"12557200","12558680"," Now, does that mean that's going to happen this time?"
"12558940","12559300"," Fuck no."
"12561300","12563100"," But there's no guarantees of that."
"12564320","12565780"," But look what's happening. "
"12566800","12571560"," Look what's happening as we come into end of quarter."
"12573580","12574320"," What's happening?"
"12575560","12577000"," Same fucking shit, right?"
"12577940","12580060"," Now, I have some concerns here."
"12580480","12582360"," I don't want to see JPM caller. "
"12583820","12586740"," Like coming up with like 2800 as the bottom strike."
"12587280","12588480"," That could create fear in the marketplace."
"12589020","12589880"," People get scared. "
"12590820","12595940"," If the JPM caller is neutral, there's likely going to be a dip that you can buy down below."
"12596900","12598100"," That's a sideways market."
"12599960","12602060"," If the JPM caller is slightly higher. "
"12602940","12606360"," It could be perceived as being very bullish."
"12608640","12610240"," Even if we roll over on the fifth."
"12613140","12616920"," So, into tomorrow, into the fifth. "
"12617760","12618260"," What is the plan?"
"12619240","12622560"," Plan is that you're going to expect hedging flows to come in."
"12624000","12625040"," Hey, buddy."
"12626480","12633760"," Plan is that you're going to expect a buffer to those hedging flows to not disrupt the market. "
"12634260","12639460"," Plan is that some of these funds are going to lift their hands off of these tickers."
"12639640","12640980"," They've been drowning all quarter."
"12641360","12642820"," It's been that's been happening all week. "
"12643220","12644860"," It's happening probably tomorrow as well."
"12645460","12647960"," You're going to see people taking vacation, be with their loved ones."
"12648200","12648880"," They're going to have a barbecue. "
"12649140","12653320"," They're going to go to the Hamptons and wear pink pants."
"12653320","12655840"," I have a bunch of manhors and cocaine."
"12657280","12658180"," That's what they're going to do. "
"12661860","12663580"," How do you capitalize on this?"
"12663840","12666520"," This is one of the best fucking times of the quarter right now."
"12666760","12667520"," I want you to know that."
"12668360","12670900"," Easiest fucking things to make money on. "
"12671800","12672480"," Right now."
"12674840","12677260"," It's the least risk you could be in right now."
"12677540","12679740"," So, what am I looking for tomorrow?"
"12680960","12683080"," I'm looking for whatever happened in that Q1. "
"12683100","12683980"," We'll look for something like this."
"12684640","12687780"," Kind of grind into the open and then a push higher."
"12688400","12689320"," That's what I'm expecting. "
"12690280","12692260"," We're looking now to the grind higher."
"12692940","12696800"," Now, I am going to be in the first hour making sure that we don't get any of that JPM"
"12696800","12697280"," bullshit."
"12698060","12700440"," Like looking for 2,800 and that kind of nonsense. "
"12700880","12701840"," I don't want to see that."
"12703000","12704140"," I don't want to see neutral."
"12706580","12709500"," You can predict usually what it's going to be. "
"12709740","12710260"," You're ready for it."
"12710280","12711080"," I'll tell you what it is."
"12711540","12713200"," JPM tomorrow you're going to expect. "
"12714040","12720300"," Same strikes or three and a half to five percent up or down."
"12721020","12722380"," You can actually calculate that."
"12722860","12723920"," You can look back at Q2. "
"12724600","12725640"," Find out what those strikes are."
"12726360","12727540"," You can see a Q2, right?"
"12729320","12731040"," You can start figuring out the math."
"12731300","12732660"," What's three and a half percent?"
"12732660","12733680"," What's five percent?"
"12733940","12735220"," Up and down in each one of those strikes. "
"12735920","12740120"," And then you can compare your math to what the strikes that come out tomorrow are."
"12740600","12746480"," And you can kind of have an idea of what the banks think are going to happen in the next"
"12746480","12746980"," quarter."
"12747880","12751340"," And then what we'll do next week is we'll let the market digest that information. "
"12752060","12759140"," We'll let people go out in public and pause it and fucking finger paint and crayons and whatever"
"12759140","12760140"," fuck it is they're going to do."
"12761660","12765100"," And then we are going to make our plan for Q3."
"12765900","12767820"," I'm going to present to you what I think happens. "
"12768320","12770380"," And you can present to me what you think is going to happen."
"12771020","12772840"," And then we're going to trade this quarter together."
"12774300","12777820"," So what do I think happens between today and tomorrow?"
"12778180","12779300"," I am long this motherfucker. "
"12779840","12784640"," This fat fucking pig until close of business tomorrow."
"12785240","12786340"," I don't know what you're doing."
"12786700","12789180"," I don't know what the fuck you think is going to happen between now and then. "
"12789180","12791780"," You think this shit's crashing between now and then fucking a right on."
"12791900","12792120"," Do it."
"12792940","12793660"," I disagree. "
"12795080","12797340"," I disagree that doing this between now and tomorrow."
"12797340","12801600"," I disagree that everybody in the fucking market is like, yeah, let's create a fucking crisis"
"12801600","12802100"," tomorrow."
"12802760","12804080"," Right before the 4th of July. "
"12804660","12804980"," Okay."
"12805280","12807640"," I think whatever you want."
"12809500","12811360"," So right now I don't think that's the case. "
"12812160","12814900"," So right now I think I'm long into tomorrow close."
"12816480","12819400"," And I'm looking for the JPM caller tomorrow."
"12820680","12827040"," And I'm likely going to have to position myself for a long at some point confirmation long"
"12827040","12827680"," tomorrow. "
"12828720","12834180"," On whatever that caller is to see if the market will stay stable into the 5th."
"12835060","12838400"," And I'm probably going to put some really dirty stinky trade on."
"12839620","12843220"," And this is the last time I'm going to say because I'm not going to say it publicly again. "
"12844280","12845340"," Don't tell anybody."
"12845960","12847920"," If we take that trade tomorrow, right?"
"12848580","12855200"," You're going to sell the open right the fucking moment that shit opens at 9.30. You're going to"
"12855200","12855700"," take your money."
"12855760","12856240"," You're going to run. "
"12857480","12861500"," Anyone out there telling you how bullish it is on that open fucking awesome sauce, man."
"12861520","12862000"," Go long."
"12862560","12863900"," You're going to be in before them. "
"12863920","12865180"," You're going to take your money and run."
"12865280","12866300"," You're going to sell into them."
"12866780","12868860"," You're going to do whatever you need to sell into them. "
"12869660","12872660"," And you're just going to then you're going to sit on your hands next week."
"12872660","12873880"," And you're going to be like, what are we doing?"
"12874140","12874700"," I'm going to be like, I don't know."
"12874820","12875520"," We're going to see what happens. "
"12876040","12877780"," We're going to try to find a dip to buy over here."
"12878100","12879360"," Or we're going to sell this market."
"12879800","12880860"," Or we're going to trade sideways. "
"12881800","12882420"," And that's what we'll do."
"12883500","12885860"," And you should trade like that and invest like that."
"12885960","12889120"," You should look at this market as what's your year long outlook?"
"12889520","12890540"," What's your quarterly outlook?"
"12890840","12891760"," What's your monthly outlook?"
"12892920","12897980"," Even if you're a day trader, even if you're a price action trader, you should have a firm idea of"
"12897980","12898900"," where this market's going. "
"12899520","12900460"," Or someone that you trust."
"12902540","12905900"," That you can just look to and say, hey, man, I trust your opinion."
"12907860","12911480"," Or hey, that girl, that woman's opinion can change. "
"12913920","12915960"," You don't have to be firm in an opinion."
"12916700","12919120"," You can have a quarterly outlook and it goes the other way."
"12920680","12922920"," You just want that person to be able to adjust to it. "
"12923360","12925800"," You don't want that person to be like, yeah, fuck you."
"12925960","12929760"," We're going down or we're going to the moon and we're actually rolling down big and heavy."
"12930800","12934380"," You don't need to be able to adjust with you or know that we're going down or know that we're"
"12934380","12938460"," having a pullback or know that it's turning into from a pullback into a correction. "
"12939500","12941040"," You know, like, do we get a pullback?"
"12941200","12941820"," This is a consolidation."
"12942100","12942520"," Is it a correction?"
"12942700","12943100"," Is it a crash?"
"12944320","12946420"," I'm able to adjust as that happens."
"12946820","12949420"," So there's a five minute chart right here. "
"12949780","12951080"," Let's take a look at it, baby."
"12951700","12953880"," It's a 334 in the afternoon, half an hour left."
"12955500","12958920"," Return to the scene of the crime is definitely on the table. "
"12960180","12963740"," We know that sellers right now are aggressive here."
"12964020","12965840"," We talked about this earlier, right?"
"12966060","12968360"," I told you this is where the sellers are."
"12968660","12970200"," This is where the sellers are, right?"
"12970920","12977540"," I told you that if we break above the sellers, we will fucking go straight to the moon, right?"
"12978240","12984180"," If we can't get break above the sellers in cash market, where is a good place to do it?"
"12984980","12987440"," The same thing as when we were selling. "
"12988320","12994360"," If you can't sell cash markets, you got to sell futures to get price where it needs to be, right?"
"12995400","12996700"," Very simple concept."
"12997740","13002380"," If you can't get past these sellers right here, how do you get past them?"
"13003500","13008700"," Well, you come right up into this little part, that shit right here, and you blast their asses"
"13008700","13015140"," right there, and you piss them off, and then you do the same thing here, and you gap this shit"
"13015140","13016520"," up into morning."
"13018080","13027580"," Price target on open tomorrow, 440, or it's 439.47. That's my price target for open tomorrow. "
"13028940","13034540"," Can sellers roll this market down in after hours?"
"13034540","13036440"," Habs so fucking lutely they can."
"13037220","13041980"," Can they roll this down in the after hours like, yeah, yeah, yeah, sell, sell, sell, sell, and then"
"13041980","13044120"," 6 a.m., boom, it gets bought and we go up here."
"13044560","13045120"," They can do that. "
"13045940","13047560"," Not anti this trade either."
"13048320","13052420"," My positive here is that we're long into the close tomorrow."
"13053220","13059980"," So I have been buying the dip here, here about this one, but adding this shit the whole long way. "
"13060520","13061960"," I've been up at certain points."
"13062380","13064160"," I'm looking for like two, three hundred percent."
"13065120","13069700"," So between, if I see any more dip by, dip by possibilities down here, I'm going to buy all this,"
"13070660","13071900"," because I'm looking for the big move. "
"13073000","13074680"," I want that bad boy right there."
"13076760","13078480"," So I want to capture that."
"13078640","13079340"," I don't want to lose it. "
"13079660","13084240"," Now if we roll at any point, we wake up down here, then my positive is wrong, right?"
"13085160","13089720"," We break this trend on the way up, we break the hourly trigger, then I'm wrong, and I'll take a"
"13089720","13089980"," short."
"13090740","13093180"," Until that happens, I'm buying the fucking dip."
"13094220","13100920"," So you either sell me on that green line right there, and I'll join you in your bearishness, right?"
"13101140","13106720"," So if we break this at any point, we didn't break this, I'll join you in your bearishness. "
"13107160","13110100"," I'll tell you every day where the bears are, right?"
"13110200","13111160"," We start selling this down."
"13111460","13113360"," I'll tell you every day, I tell it every day in the stream."
"13113520","13114160"," I'm like, there's the bears. "
"13114720","13117280"," This is where the probable short side."
"13117440","13118740"," This is where they're going to roll it right here."
"13119500","13125360"," So if we get underneath this green line tomorrow at any point and reject it, we will turn around"
"13125360","13127040"," and become bears again, right?"
"13127240","13131840"," We'll roll it down, the green will come down, we'll trade back up to the green, we'll trade that"
"13131840","13133760"," back up, then we'll come back down until it's done. "
"13134000","13140360"," So right now, dip buying opportunities for me into the close on tomorrow."
"13141160","13151300"," I'm hoping that that JPM caller provides stability for that trade into the fifth, and"
"13151300","13155220"," I don't feel comfortable taking that trade until I see that caller."
"13155960","13158020"," So I want to see that what that caller says. "
"13158500","13164240"," If that caller comes in neutral or lower, I will likely remain flat into the fifth."
"13164980","13168520"," So it's important to me to see the reaction, the sentiment."
"13169060","13172740"," You need people to believe that we can go up. "
"13173360","13179420"," So if you, if we have a call wall above us, speaking with a friend this morning, I said, do"
"13179420","13182240"," you think we just trade 443 or do you think we're going higher?"
"13182720","13183440"," And he couldn't give an answer."
"13183600","13184180"," And I agree."
"13185900","13194260"," You need to see the sentiment of the market be open to higher highs. "
"13195660","13205300"," If they are open to higher highs, they will fucking buy and sell calls at 460 and 470."
"13206200","13206660"," Do we go there?"
"13206820","13207400"," Maybe not."
"13208180","13210600"," But you want to see that happen for that bullishness. "
"13210980","13214900"," You want to see like 460s, 470s get talked about."
"13215340","13217260"," You want to see people discussing it in public."
"13217940","13223700"," So until we see that, and JPM will help fuel that conversation. "
"13224760","13229080"," JPM will help fuel the conversation that nowhere, not going up there."
"13229760","13231660"," Their top target, let's say, is 445."
"13232800","13234800"," You see some shit like that in the caller tomorrow. "
"13235740","13236780"," That's not no bueno."
"13237480","13238440"," No bueno."
"13239180","13242360"," You want to see like 456, 460 somewhere in there. "
"13243380","13248980"," Because I know that if it's up there, that we can definitely trade 460 and 465."
"13250800","13253320"," So it's something big for me to be looking at."
"13253580","13254340"," What are we doing tomorrow?"
"13255820","13261240"," So if right now I'm bullish into tomorrow, we are following a trend up right now. "
"13261800","13264720"," If you have the opportunity to buy this trend, fuck yeah."
"13265900","13273140"," If you're a sell side and you want to sell this trend all the way up, keep doing what you"
"13273140","13273280"," do."
"13273840","13276440"," You know, I know some guys like selling and not buying. "
"13276740","13279680"," So if you're up here and you see this, you're teeing off on this."
"13280340","13281900"," You're trying to tee off all the way up."
"13282060","13282540"," I get it. "
"13282840","13285300"," I understand that you want to be on sell side all the time."
"13285440","13285880"," I understand it."
"13286680","13287080"," 100%. "
"13287540","13290540"," There's no big sell though until you break underneath right now currently."
"13291120","13295720"," You need to break this right, this zone right in here for the big trade down."
"13296160","13300920"," If we do break that and it holds, we're going to the depths of fucking hell. "
"13303160","13305120"," You're going to, you're going to see us ride."
"13306680","13308000"," You will see us ride."
"13308020","13312980"," If we break and hold big bars, half our bars right here, you will see us trade the color. "
"13313160","13319480"," You will see us trade the daily trigger down here at 427 and likely trade 412."
"13320740","13322020"," Right now, I think it's at 414."
"13323140","13325320"," It's maybe 420 about that. "
"13325940","13327160"," I think the weekly is at, I think, 428."
"13327640","13328820"," By the time we get there to be like 420."
"13330200","13332420"," So different trade is a different trade. "
"13332740","13334340"," There's another trade below it."
"13334420","13335100"," Each one is different."
"13335840","13336940"," We're not there yet. "
"13337360","13340580"," So if you want to be there on that trade, so be it."
"13341760","13347360"," My outlook for tomorrow is we close this, that we return to the scene of the crime here in a"
"13347360","13347660"," Friday."
"13348300","13350780"," That would be my big move there. "
"13351540","13354840"," At minimum, tomorrow I'd like to see us close the gap at 440."
"13356060","13364260"," So minimum, 439.47. Max Payne, probably 444.01 for the close."
"13364580","13366160"," They might save this for next week. "
"13367000","13369500"," We could do this tomorrow and then you've got the close."
"13369940","13371680"," Monday we come in and start making our way up."
"13372460","13374500"," And then we actually tag it on the fifth. "
"13375080","13376280"," Here's the fifth right here."
"13377300","13382080"," So I might be, might be overextending or over ambitious."
"13383940","13384780"," This is Thursday. "
"13385260","13385860"," This is Friday."
"13386320","13388220"," I believe it's Monday or Monday."
"13388340","13390600"," I think this is to be Wednesday open. "
"13391340","13394860"," So it could take us tomorrow all the way to get up there."
"13395500","13399560"," And to that Monday, maybe we open the opening bell here at 444."
"13400720","13403480"," And let's say that the JPM caller is great. "
"13404160","13407000"," And all these bulls jump on board and they're all fucking woo."
"13407240","13407360"," Yeah."
"13407360","13410120"," And we saw that shit down in the depth of hell. "
"13410500","13414740"," And that's where the real dip buy is to get up to that 456 or 460 or whatever."
"13415440","13416460"," That's what I'm hoping for."
"13417660","13424540"," If that the JPM caller comes in and it's not pretty, I am going to look to begin to take"
"13424540","13425880"," a short position for the quarter. "
"13426960","13430120"," And I'll get real fucking bearish on this quarter on Q3."
"13430340","13432160"," So I want to know what's up."
"13432800","13433500"," I'm sure you do. "
"13433800","13435700"," Do you guys not care about that?"
"13435700","13436380"," Maybe you don't."
"13436960","13445300"," But for me, if I see any kind of bearishness from JPM, I'm not going to be fucking Mr. Bulltown"
"13445300","13445740"," for you."
"13445940","13455790"," So you'll find out Q3 in the next"
"13455790","13456970"," couple days. "
"13457610","13460130"," You'll get my stance on what I think the market's going to do."
"13461410","13465910"," And so right now I'm long calls into this close and I'm long for tomorrow's open."
"13467270","13467790"," What's up?"
"13467890","13468310"," Let's do it. "
"13469070","13470010"," Happy quarter, man."
"13470230","13471310"," Happy end of quarter to you."
"13471930","13474830"," If you've been with us every quarter, you've been here for years with us. "
"13474930","13475650"," You know what this is."
"13476090","13477530"," You know what this process is."
"13478090","13479950"," We have conversations via phone call. "
"13480190","13482270"," We have conversations about it inside the discord."
"13482770","13484550"," We talk about it everywhere, right?"
"13485070","13485490"," Nonstop."
"13486790","13487490"," Nothing's changed. "
"13487690","13489270"," We do this every quarter."
"13490290","13491970"," So let's see what's going on, man."
"13492230","13493490"," Let me know in the chat, maybe. "
"13494270","13495310"," Let me know what you think."
"13495430","13500870"," Do you think that the JPM caller comes in positive, neutral or bearish or negative?"
"13501650","13502890"," Lower, what should I say?"
"13503350","13504950"," Lower, same or higher?"
"13505410","13506350"," Higher, same, lower."
"13507810","13508950"," Happy end of quarter to you. "
"13509710","13512790"," If you guys trade by the quarter, congratulations, you made it."
"13512910","13513090"," You're alive."
"13513690","13514670"," You're in my chat right now. "
"13515090","13516870"," I want to thank all of you for still being alive."
"13518390","13518970"," You made it."
"13519470","13520790"," You graduated another quarter. "
"13520790","13522710"," Seriously, congratulations to you."
"13523810","13524790"," You made it."
"13526650","13527670"," Seriously, congratulations. "
"13528990","13529590"," You're still here."
"13530570","13533330"," We always shed and gain new people every quarter."
"13534210","13536610"," If you didn't make it, I hope that you come back. "
"13537690","13539730"," If you survive the quarter, congratulations."
"13540050","13540950"," Say it's not easy to do."
"13541570","13543110"," So it's not an easy thing. "
"13546330","13547290"," Right on, right on."
"13547290","13547930"," Right on."
"13549650","13550810"," All you guys are still here. "
"13550870","13552870"," I fucking like seeing you guys still here after all this time."
"13553130","13554890"," So look at that."
"13555010","13556790"," I got a little bit of a loss. "
"13557150","13558690"," 3.44. We've got a little bit of a..."
"13558690","13559950"," See what's going on right there?"
"13560890","13561510"," Watching that."
"13563670","13565570"," A little of a liquidity break in the market."
"13572950","13574730"," Trying to pull a rug into the bell, baby. "
"13578390","13579930"," Yeah, you guys are all still here, man."
"13580070","13580570"," It means a lot."
"13581310","13582790"," It's like quarter is over, dude. "
"13583290","13584010"," Good job."
"13584150","13585090"," You guys are all still here."
"13588670","13593990"," So looking again now to the early mark from close imbalance, still sitting at $505 million to the"
"13593990","13594410"," south side. "
"13596370","13597930"," Yeah, I love you too, just some guy."
"13598150","13599030"," Almost three years, baby."
"13599870","13600710"," Love you, man. "
"13601190","13601910"," Fucking love you."
"13605930","13607690"," Do I think we get a squeeze like yesterday?"
"13608070","13608430"," I don't know."
"13609050","13610730"," I'm long calls for tomorrow. "
"13610950","13612130"," I didn't do any zero dates today."
"13612870","13615150"," So I'm long into tomorrow's bell."
"13615490","13617310"," I'll hold these things right into the bell tomorrow. "
"13619290","13620230"," Or they go to zero."
"13620770","13621390"," I don't care."
"13621870","13622910"," It's a lottery trade. "
"13623670","13624170"," It's a test."
"13630470","13636630"," They're getting the idea that they raise the strikes, but not significantly higher."
"13637670","13639690"," So you think I'm going to get higher on the JPM caller?"
"13639890","13640270"," I do too. "
"13641530","13644370"," I think we get the 4.56 tops."
"13644790","13646670"," Top strike tomorrow somewhere in there."
"13647670","13648070"," 4530. "
"13650470","13652170"," I think that's the strike that I was thinking."
"13652210","13654050"," Or maybe it was a slight lower winky."
"13654290","13655130"," Was it 4.45?"
"13655450","13655550"," Maybe. "
"13655730","13656310"," Can't remember."
