"88460","89220"," How y'all doing?"
"89220","90060"," Hope you all had a great weekend."
"94820","95780"," That's Joe doing it. "
"96440","100680"," I don't think he knows that I put his picture on there though."
"101860","103180"," I don't know what he's going to say."
"103420","104480"," Maybe somebody should tell him. "
"105880","106680"," What does I get?"
"109220","111060"," I got a what I got to do there."
"114550","117330"," I got to make sure the bots don't come in today."
"118730","120370"," Okay, subscribers only. "
"122190","123090"," Any duration."
"123810","126030"," Okay, so it's just subscribers be able to comment this morning."
"126790","130130"," If you're just doing this for the first time, please like, subscribe if you want to make comments. "
"133430","134830"," You got to subscribe, I guess."
"135150","135850"," It keeps the bots out."
"135990","137870"," We get these Russian chicks in here. "
"138330","144650"," They find all the everyone in chat hot and they want these guys to and these girls to these them's"
"144650","147990"," and they's to check them out."
"151010","152250"," Okay, right over the live stream."
"152910","154750"," I'm going to waste any time this morning is a long weekend. "
"157100","158940"," Let's see what you guys are saying this morning."
"159900","160820"," First off, good morning."
"161000","161740"," Hope y'all had a great weekend. "
"162800","164540"," Do that blast off this morning."
"165960","167840"," We did slam through a level though."
"168060","169140"," We did slam through level one. "
"169180","170100"," They bought it right back up."
"171060","174700"," How long this lasts is to is yet to be seen."
"175660","180220"," I'll go over some some places of interest for you if you're a bear. "
"180820","183460"," There's probably another cell signal coming up."
"185940","193870"," I'll give you a level here to be looking for maybe 4063."
"197840","200340"," That's not showing up on book map at this moment. "
"202060","204340"," But we're running an algo in the background and algorithm."
"204560","205840"," We're going to see how this works out."
"206940","207780"," Could be lower. "
"208220","211340"," I've got it here at 403, but it doesn't it doesn't track exact."
"211720","212460"," It could be that 404."
"213220","215580"," That top that top of the key right there. "
"215840","216780"," That pivot point."
"217140","219840"," We'll go into it and how to interact with it and."
"222400","226200"," How predictive predictive it is and how good the predictions are for us. "
"226240","231900"," The predictions are to meet OPEC closer because oil producers stopped injecting crude into"
"231900","234160"," pipelines to you guys are talking about."
"234940","235600"," Good morning."
"235760","236720"," Good morning, Dylan. "
"236720","240280"," Good morning, Dean, Jay Cortino, Joe Nutello, or Hitolo."
"240840","241580"," Good morning, X."
"241820","242320"," Good morning, Sue."
"242420","242780"," Good morning. "
"243460","245000"," R squared 89 Bikies in the house."
"245880","247160"," El Marino, Meliella, Winky."
"247840","249020"," What up, Winky?"
"249320","254500"," We're currently able to meet OPEC closer because oil producers stopped injecting crude into"
"254500","254780"," pipelines. "
"255980","259320"," You know, I've got so winky is Winky's trying to break off from Twitter."
"260040","268520"," So we're going to move the newsletter over to the website so that a winky can get access to it."
"268660","272020"," People that join us just on YouTube can gain access to it. "
"272580","275560"," Joe and I are working on making that happen over the next week or so."
"276660","281660"," So you guys can have safe haven no matter what social media platform you're on."
"281740","286300"," If you only use YouTube, we're going to be streaming, I think, some on some other platforms as"
"286300","286500"," well. "
"286500","293780"," So depending on how you find us, you'll have one place to go to consistently not never have to"
"293780","296460"," worry about how to find the information we put out."
"299140","301680"," I wish Winky could have seen that stuff this morning."
"301740","303140"," He probably has no idea we're talking about. "
"303980","309180"," So I'll try to get that stuff to him at some point so that he's always in the loop."
"310740","311360"," Good morning."
"311460","311740"," Real high. "
"311800","312020"," Good morning."
"312160","312240"," Go."
"314420","317700"," We can apply that to any ticker that you like fishing. "
"317920","319260"," Good morning fishing with pan fish."
"319320","319900"," Good to see you, Dan."
"320140","321020"," I haven't seen you in a while. "
"321040","322500"," Have you been working or have you been on vacation?"
"323620","324400"," Scott Connolly."
"324400","324760"," Good morning."
"324960","326640"," Elite with 1987. "
"326640","328040"," Mel yellow indices."
"328140","329560"," We trust Tony Cheese in the house."
"330700","331420"," Wilson Connor. "
"332520","333240"," John Smith."
"333460","333620"," Everton."
"333780","334180"," Patrick. "
"334660","336180"," You guys got a bunch of in here."
"336180","336760"," D Crosby."
"337120","338080"," There's a whole bunch of people in here. "
"338620","339120"," Don mafia."
"339380","339640"," Good morning."
"340160","341160"," Thanks for hitting that like button. "
"341200","341740"," I appreciate that."
"341780","342180"," Don mafia."
"344500","345940"," The blots won all your money. "
"346060","346300"," Roha."
"346600","347140"," How are you, brother?"
"348160","350560"," So Roha is asking, what about the blast up?"
"350760","353340"," I think that you should first go back into."
"353900","356940"," Well, first you have to have the context of the blast up. "
"357100","360100"," Let's talk with Roha real quick because I think that people's expectations."
"362600","367700"," Six month bills total three spot eight billion dollars and fed bids for three month bills total"
"367700","369300"," four spot six billion dollars."
"369400","370700"," I think the people's expectations. "
"371760","373360"," Are they here what they want to hear?"
"373520","378300"," So I think you have to consume or take the entire picture into if you watch my posts on at"
"378300","378940"," Captain's Alpha."
"379580","385320"," If you watch the live stream specifically on Friday at the end of the live stream, I had spoken to"
"385320","389960"," about what I would like to see over Friday and into Monday Tuesday."
"390740","391700"," Which was a decline. "
"393040","401300"," Now we did go up and clean out on Friday, the gaps that were above, but we continued down and"
"401300","401700"," today."
"402440","407620"," So there's a there's this concept of longer timeframes, shorter timeframes."
"407840","410800"," What are you asking for to happen in those timeframes?"
"410980","414140"," So I want you to be clear with you. "
"415060","419580"," And I want you to be clear with me on which time frame you're speaking of so that we're not"
"419580","424220"," or muddling what exactly is going on."
"424600","429180"," So if you follow the Captain's Alpha, you'll see every morning you'll get my take on what to expect"
"429180","430940"," and then the live stream is the same thing."
"431540","436700"," And then when I post on Captain Jim James, you want to look on that time frame as well. "
"437380","439240"," Nothing is straight up straight down."
"439240","443980"," I guess that's my point in general."
"444240","447980"," So when you're looking on different timeframes, you're going to expect different outcomes. "
"449640","453420"," And every day I should be putting out some kind of a daily brief view or most days I try"
"453420","453660"," to."
"454700","458420"," So you can get a feel for what's going to happen or my expectations are at the end of the"
"458420","458860"," day as well."
"459520","462780"," And you can see that that is lined up very well. "
"463640","467940"," In the past couple weeks, maybe, maybe longer."
"471200","472980"," So, okay, so that's answering his question."
"473640","475180"," Howdy cap, good morning, cooked sweet D."
"475360","475600"," How are you?"
"476200","479700"," Jean Torres, Molly, Ryan Morris, good morning, Liam. "
"482240","482960"," Good morning, Omar."
"483300","483660"," How are you, brother?"
"484880","486240"," Let me see what you guys are saying in here."
"489340","490000"," Good morning, Mark. "
"490160","491220"," Mark, we're able to see you too."
"492440","493520"," Yeah, Winky, I got your brother."
"493520","494520"," I got you covered. "
"496420","497240"," RXT got hacked."
"497500","500120"," Usually that brings the stock down for a day or two and then it recovers."
"500780","501940"," Don't know if that will happen this time. "
"502080","502560"," Just pointing it out."
"502700","503460"," Thanks for the heads up link."
"504800","506060"," So you've been working pan fish. "
"507260","508040"," To be in and outs."
"508760","509640"," I appreciate that brother."
"510140","510740"," Appreciate it, Dan. "
"515419","518500"," So, Roha is asking our wrong."
"522919","525320"," So, let's go back to."
"526480","528940"," I'm on for one day. "
"532400","533480"," Good to see you, Omar."
"533700","535260"," I saw that comment from you this morning as well."
"536780","538200"," So, let's look at a few things. "
"538460","539220"," We'll look at a few things."
"539580","542460"," So, let's look at a larger time frame here."
"542660","546860"," Print crude futures turned negative after earlier rising over two dollars a barrel. "
"547600","550020"," Let's look at the book map."
"550200","551480"," Let's get rid of book map here."
"553840","557040"," And we'll take a look at a larger time frame, right?"
"557040","558520"," This is sponsored by To the Tick. "
"558920","565400"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at ToTheTick.com."
"566280","568060"," We ended up taking some puts in here, right?"
"568220","568760"," You guys remember that?"
"568760","572900"," And then remember I think it was Jim James or I caught himself."
"573100","574740"," I closed for profit on the open, right?"
"575460","576100"," Right down here."
"576120","577300"," So, we closed for profit on the open. "
"578900","583120"," We came up here, as a matter of fact, I think I got out of stream somewhere around here to"
"583120","583700"," leave on Friday."
"584340","589180"," And I gave you my synopsis for what to expect for this week and what I wanted to see to"
"589180","590580"," make this constructive into this week."
"591060","592560"," And you can go back and just watch on the tape. "
"593240","594020"," All this shit's on the tape."
"594240","597860"," Like, everything that I say to you out there publicly, it said before it happens."
"597860","605940"," You'll never see me come out on any social media platform and say, after the fact, hey, look, you"
"605940","607000"," think of any kind of a fucking nonsense?"
"607320","608060"," This is great, you know. "
"609480","614400"," I'm trying to give you my best guess educated opinion as to what's going to happen."
"614840","620180"," And so, in here somewhere, I told you that I'm looking for the market to roll over into Monday and"
"620180","623460"," Tuesday, possibly even further into the week."
"623460","630280"," At 11.30 a.m. Eastern time, the U.S. sells $54 billion in three month bills, prior bid to"
"630280","634560"," cover, 256, high rate, four spot, two, eight, five percent. "
"635300","641040"," U.S. sells 45 billion dollars in six month bills, prior bid to cover, two to 90, and prior high"
"641040","642580"," rate of four spot, five percent."
"643740","649240"," Now, of course, of course, yes, Friday, when I got off, we end up coming up here and I posted"
"649240","650180"," on Twitter about this."
"650820","652100"," I think we hit both of these. "
"653260","654300"," I think it was this one."
"654480","657420"," This was the first gap with some way here and the second gap was somewhere right here."
"659240","660520"," One more quick push up. "
"661820","668300"," And then I'd ask the question on Twitter, do you think we can close on the high for previous"
"668300","668560"," Thursday?"
"669000","672600"," And I put a post and said the bears are saying no fucking way."
"672600","679500"," And I agree with that statement that there's no fucking way we're getting a new higher high on"
"679500","680200"," Friday."
"680960","683480"," And earlier in the day in Friday, I said the same thing about VIX. "
"683520","685820"," You need to have the VIX go up a little."
"685960","686440"," You can't really."
"688400","690360"," You can't expect just this. "
"691660","693060"," And it just never ends."
"693260","693500"," You can."
"693680","699000"," There are melt up situations that we can't expect in a certain environment, but in a larger time"
"699000","700220"," frame, you're not going to expect that. "
"700220","702900"," We can actually expect this when we're in negative gamma, too."
"703380","707320"," If you guys know if we're in negative gamma, you'll see rips that are straight up."
"708720","710020"," When you're in positive gamma. "
"712020","713840"," Sorry, I just use this."
"714060","716120"," I just cleaning out some dust from my computer this morning."
"716520","719700"," In positive gamma, you're going to see a move higher down. "
"720040","722200"," It'll be like a slow mover move up."
"722480","724840"," So you're not going to expect straight up."
"725000","725840"," So you wouldn't expect that. "
"725840","733620"," And as a matter of fact, in negative gamma, when we sell off, you'll see straight up rips until"
"733620","734720"," they sell back off again."
"735200","736960"," So just different environment."
"737540","739220"," You're not going to expect that to happen. "
"739220","741340"," And that wasn't my expectation that we would get ultimized."
"741580","744540"," And you wouldn't expect that in a positive gamma environment at all."
"744840","745420"," Sometimes you get it. "
"745920","750720"," If you sell off enough in a positive gamma, you'll slingshot back up."
"752000","754780"," But it's just not characteristically a part of that."
"755020","756240"," What to expect in that environment. "
"757140","759600"," So this is constructive for you."
"759760","763300"," So just if you're a bull out there, this is very constructive for you."
"764280","769780"," You want to see a consolidation trade down into the next coming days, at least. "
"770960","772460"," You'd like to see this."
"772620","777360"," You'd like to see us have an orderly sell off the VIX to climb a little bit."
"777360","783920"," And then hopefully be able to position yourself for at least some kind of a move up. "
"784680","788760"," Into end of week, possibly Monday, Tuesday, let's say."
"789060","790640"," We have a J pow."
"791660","793840"," Coming up was the next week right on Tuesday. "
"794440","795900"," Make sure I get the dates right over here."
"795980","796220"," Hold on."
"799980","801880"," Let's look at a larger time frame here. "
"807540","812580"," So we've got some J pow over here on the 14th, right."
"816000","818200"," Here's J pow's pressure coming up here, right?"
"819200","824240"," And this is Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday right here."
"824960","832340"," So a lot of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday right here. "
"833000","838880"," So you kind of want to, what I would like to see is some kind of, some kind of moment"
"838880","840720"," where we're able to come down, right?"
"841020","841980"," You can buy as a bull."
"841980","846960"," You can kind of buy a dip down here and at least catch this move up into Friday."
"846960","847720"," Does that make sense?"
"848980","854780"," So you're able to catch a move down, ride this up, kind of risk, risk, risk, risk, risk free. "
"855780","857220"," This could even be higher, right?"
"858500","861120"," You don't want to be buying this right on the bell this morning."
"861680","867360"," I think the model that I sent to you, if you were to go to Captain's Off this morning, even"
"867360","872680"," the model that I sent to you this morning, predicted the sell-off right off the bell, right?"
"873060","873880"," You guys know that, right?"
"874220","879520"," Many of you guys that were on our Captain's Off could read that it said to expect the sell off"
"879520","885660"," the bell this morning, which we continue to get off the open this morning."
"886180","887400"," And so you're looking for that, right?"
"888000","893180"," As a bear, you were looking for that this morning as well, the sell-off the bell to take this"
"893180","894360"," part of the trade right here. "
"894360","901620"," You know on a larger time frame, if we're looking at a month, let's say, that I always tell you"
"901620","903760"," to trade the levels no matter what, right?"
"903960","907300"," No matter what an algo tells you, you want to trade the levels."
"907900","909680"," We've talked about trading this level."
"909940","911940"," We've talked about trading this level. "
"912360","914660"," And then we've talked about the meaty one down here, right?"
"914740","919160"," If you want to start getting bearish, it's not until you get some confirmation down here."
"919240","919840"," Does that make sense?"
"920420","925000"," As you trade each level, you use the algo to predict where we're headed."
"926340","930200"," And then if you're a bull, where are you really looking to buy a dip right now is somewhere down"
"930200","930540"," in here. "
"930560","931100"," Does that make sense?"
"931360","934640"," It's a 66 prior high rate of 4 spot, 285%."
"934640","940780"," U.S. sells $45 billion in six month bills, prior bid to cover of 2 to 90, and a prior"
"940780","943420"," high rate of 4 spot, 5%, 5%."
"944700","951040"," Yeah, I'm starting to like, when it comes to news, I'm getting like, I'm getting even more and more"
"951040","952580"," like I really don't care about the news. "
"954540","955900"," I really don't care."
"956220","964180"," I was talking to Joe this morning and I had sent him some Tesla predictions from yesterday, and"
"964180","965780"," they held through this morning."
"967480","974520"," And of course news dropped this morning about Tesla and China, and I'm like, oh, shocker that this"
"974520","975480"," news dropped this morning. "
"975480","982740"," It's almost like they're running similar algorithms and then ramp or give traction or decide to"
"982740","985640"," drop news at specific times."
"989600","992240"," So at any rate, let's go back to the one day here."
"998740","1007760"," Yeah, the algo is kind of saying to expect something like, yeah, some kind of a, this should be"
"1007760","1020060"," doing this, yeah, but some kind of a, because that we're going to see, but some kind"
"1020060","1023160"," of a move down like that, and then you're going to get your rip towards end of week. "
"1024940","1026000"," I'll post those things."
"1026599","1030760"," That stuff's going to go behind a, that's just a heads up as we run these things."
"1031880","1037579"," As we develop them, put them out, you're going to get them, get access to those tools. "
"1038819","1045260"," You can apply them, however you like, and I'll give you a list of things to use when you're using"
"1045260","1052020"," these tools so that you can do a quantitative analysis of the algorithm."
"1057150","1058190"," Hold on a second here."
"1060530","1064450"," As it does change depending upon, there's a couple, we'll talk about that later. "
"1064550","1065730"," It's not something we're going to talk about right now."
"1066910","1068590"," Let me scroll up here and see what you guys are saying."
"1072370","1073110"," It's more in heaven. "
"1073110","1073590"," How are you?"
"1073930","1074870"," I think I already said hello to you."
"1076590","1083210"," Federalist for Chase and Fed officials have clearly signal plans to raise rates by 50 basis points"
"1083210","1084930"," at their meeting next week."
"1085210","1086990"," Yeah, that was, I think that was always known, right?"
"1087730","1093390"," So before you even go on with the rest of whatever Chase is posting, let's be clear here. "
"1094850","1100630"," The federal funds rate gives, you know, there's a percentage chance of what's going to happen."
"1101570","1103130"," It was 50 basis points."
"1103870","1110830"," There have been times, or there, there was an interview that Jay Powell gave where he was open to. "
"1110970","1113890"," This is prior to his last speech that he did."
"1113890","1118530"," I think it was the last meeting he was in, or minutes, or there was an interview part."
"1118690","1119130"," There was an interview. "
"1119990","1121750"," I want to say two or three weeks ago."
"1121950","1128230"," Like two or three weeks ago, there was an interview given where he said it was open to higher rates"
"1128230","1129770"," to 75 BPS."
"1130650","1135610"," And so you'll hear people on social media say, you know, wouldn't it be cool or great"
"1135610","1143830"," if he did a surprise. "
"1143830","1150850"," The federal funds rate, I believe, was showing now a higher probability of 25 basis points due to"
"1150850","1151790"," his last interview."
"1152570","1155130"," So, so 50 is what I would expect."
"1156170","1157370"," Just as a baseline. "
"1158370","1162170"," I can understand both arguments for 25 and a 75."
"1162810","1163290"," Surprise."
"1163670","1167550"," And even the volatility of three month bills bid to cover ratio. "
"1168130","1169250"," That being put out publicly."
"1171010","1175370"," To keep everyone on their toes is a 25 is a 50 or 75 seems like every time we go"
"1175370","1175730"," to a meeting."
"1176710","1181210"," You've got speakers that talk or bring up that. "
"1182210","1184570"," Bull or a wider range."
"1187130","1191450"," We'll talk about that later on if you want about the fed and the speakers and."
"1193230","1197710"," Data dependence and all those kind of issues covering your own ass. "
"1197970","1198830"," I heard that yesterday."
"1198970","1200950"," I was like, definitely, definitely."
"1205250","1211170"," What else is chasing elevated wage pressures could muddy the debate over 50 versus 25 February. "
"1212130","1214930"," And lead officials to pencil and more hikes next year."
"1214930","1224010"," I don't know if I have some disagreements on some of the some of the data that's being publicly"
"1224010","1226990"," released on wages unemployment."
"1229730","1232950"," There's a lot of money in of the water by federal Fed officials. "
"1234950","1244910"," That's kind of shocking."
"1244910","1246950"," They're pumping or dumping of markets by Fed officials."
"1247370","1248810"," They're under a blackout right now. "
"1249950","1251730"," They're a whole intent is to create."
"1255970","1258710"," Uncertainty in the discussion in the marketplace."
"1259470","1265330"," But there are there are other indicators and data available that suggest otherwise. "
"1267290","1273190"," Not only the not only a pause or slowing of rates, but they're going to fucking have to get rid"
"1273190","1273530"," of rates."
"1273990","1278130"," And possibly move into no rates, even."
"1278730","1279570"," Yeah, it's kind of weird. "
"1279670","1280070"," Everyone's like."
"1280790","1284330"," Well, I don't plan your inflation inflation is going to come down at 2%."
"1284910","1287890"," And then you have people saying you're going to see. "
"1288770","1291430"," You know, death and destruction in the economy."
"1292570","1293450"," In 2023."
"1294730","1296670"," It's weird because people talk of two miles. "
"1298270","1302250"," And then people will say things like, you know, there's wage problems out there."
"1302390","1303510"," It's going to get ugly and nasty."
"1304090","1308930"," You got like two two competing forces, but then no one wants to say, well, they're not going to"
"1308930","1310210"," fucking raise keep raising rates. "
"1310890","1313150"," Is that if that if they broke in something right?"
"1313290","1313570"," So it's like."
"1315590","1316670"," You know, it's like fear."
"1317030","1318690"," Fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear, fear. "
"1318890","1320370"," And all this fear is."
"1322010","1323850"," Gear just towards two things."
"1323970","1326430"," It's geared towards you accepting inflation. "
"1327510","1331550"," In the hope that the inflation comes down while they pump this fear."
"1333290","1335110"," Whereas the data suggests otherwise."
"1337750","1345530"," And, you know, again, and then how it acts in our, you know, the economy is not the stock market. "
"1345850","1347850"," So you have to separate both of those."
"1348650","1351710"," And the, you know, I try to explain this people with the."
"1352470","1355470"," You get the two to 67, two to 67. "
"1356510","1357850"," You get the stock trader hat."
"1358890","1360190"," And then you get your main street hat."
"1360190","1363190"," So when I talk to my friends or when I'm voting or. "
"1363530","1365610"," 7% for spot to 7%."
"1365610","1369630"," As a matter of fact, like spot spot, 6, 6% of bids at high."
"1370930","1373250"," It's prime example is I'm a demo. "
"1373430","1374370"," People probably know I'm a Democrat."
"1374370","1377510"," I'm a little bit to cover ratio two to 57, two to 57."
"1377970","1382930"," Sales, 49 billion six month bills, high rate, four spot, five, seven percent, four spot, five,"
"1383030","1383510"," seven percent. "
"1384230","1388410"," Yeah, if a wife asks me or my, my, my kids ask me that, you know, it's always, you know,"
"1389010","1389490"," fuck Trump."
"1389890","1393270"," But then, of course, if you ask me, I fucking love him."
"1393330","1394790"," The fucking guy is maybe so much money. "
"1394910","1395450"," It's not even funny."
"1395450","1395750"," Right."
"1395910","1396730"," It takes right. "
"1396870","1398110"," Allow you to actually hear."
"1398170","1399170"," To flame futures."
"1399410","1400710"," Forex and stock instruments. "
"1401150","1403750"," My point trial had takes right.com."
"1404050","1406090"," My point behind that is."
"1407030","1408110"," You can see."
"1409200","1414050"," That the initial reaction off of the possibility of low rates in our stock market. "
"1414570","1415670"," Was to pump it."
"1416210","1420430"," And so you can't always rely upon economic data."
"1421070","1423930"," And how it impacts our stock market. "
"1423930","1427110"," Our stock market is not our economy."
"1427510","1427770"," It's not."
"1428270","1433150"," They're just, you know, two different things and they don't always correlate. "
"1433530","1440730"," There are some things that do always correlate the unemployment rate does correlate over time."
"1441510","1447170"," It's one of the best indicators, I think, for, for when you actually see market crashes."
"1449510","1453090"," There are some that sometimes correlate some that sometimes don't. "
"1454070","1459490"," There are others that do correlate quite consistently."
"1460430","1463550"," And so over time, too, this is, you know, a large time frame."
"1464050","1466590"," So there are some things you are looking for that can correlate. "
"1466810","1470690"," But oftentimes on a smaller time frame, you're not going to see those correlations."
"1471210","1473450"," And, you know, it's interesting."
"1473450","1475930"," Someone posted yesterday that we would see 3100 now. "
"1476210","1479210"," My point was, what kind of time frame are you talking about?"
"1479270","1480190"," And then my other point was."
"1481490","1484950"," If I have a model that says we can easily, easily."
"1485770","1489550"," Go to four, 34, 40 or 4, 4300 or 4400. "
"1490150","1491810"," And you're saying we can go to 3100."
"1492850","1495270"," But does that model take an account of going to 40?"
"1495730","1498210"," Does your model change if we go to 43 or 4400?"
"1498950","1501550"," Can you take a short on the market?"
"1502450","1506110"," For matter of fact, I don't show those numbers until I show a couple of attempts at it."
"1506390","1507990"," In springtime and then next fall. "
"1508350","1510270"," And believe it or not, 2024."
"1511370","1512170"," In springtime."
"1512190","1516650"," But my question then becomes, can you take a short look like right where you are right now and"
"1516650","1517870"," account for us going up. "
"1518750","1519550"," To 4300."
"1519750","1521970"," Will your bank allow you to stay in that position?"
"1522630","1523630"," Or how much more do you have to add?"
"1523850","1525130"," How much does it cost to carry that short?"
"1525870","1528630"," And you're telling me you're not going to get a phone call at some point."
"1529990","1530790"," So there's. "
"1531730","1534090"," And then does your model account for when we're up there?"
"1534170","1538370"," Does it actually come back down to 4100 from 4300?"
"1538370","1539610"," That's what you're saying, right?"
"1540070","1541230"," How long does it take to get there?"
"1542010","1543850"," Says like all these other questions."
"1545850","1550210"," When you make those statements in positioning is key."
"1550510","1552010"," Everybody knows positioning is key. "
"1552830","1554070"," Positioning is key and buying a dip."
"1554350","1555690"," Positioning is key in."
"1556670","1557650"," Where do you buy that dip?"
"1557850","1560010"," Holding that dip for cyclically. "
"1560970","1562210"," Where are you to hold that dip?"
"1562410","1562850"," That kind of stuff."
"1564170","1567570"," So I don't think those that those answers are those questions are always answered."
"1572270","1576790"," Yeah, I keep hearing about the rising wedge every like I heard that rising wedge. "
"1576790","1577550"," Let me see."
"1579210","1580750"," News is noisy too much noise."
"1580750","1581570"," Yeah, I agree with that. "
"1582490","1585610"," I mean, I'll sometime have trend line in this rising wedge meet exactly Wednesday."
"1585930","1589290"," Amazing how it's always foretold too much noise."
"1589670","1590290"," News is noisy. "
"1590490","1592490"," China news was foretold last week or before."
"1592990","1593250"," Yeah."
"1593830","1596250"," Yeah, you know, Chase, we talked about remember we talked about that chase. "
"1596490","1598690"," We were like everyone that the China news broke."
"1599530","1601910"," I posted about it like the overnight."
"1602170","1603650"," I think there's a few of us there up overnight. "
"1604750","1606530"," I remember Sader was up overnight."
"1607670","1610370"," And we were all watching the Dixie."
"1611310","1615190"," Or not Dixie, but DX in the overnight dollar futures. "
"1616130","1619510"," Waiting for an announcement from China."
"1620050","1621210"," And of course they tried to."
"1621590","1626870"," They tried to manipulate the currency markets and then of course the stock markets. "
"1627170","1628490"," They don't like anyone making any money out there."
"1628570","1631130"," So the softening the blow of reopening."
"1632050","1634290"," And so Chase is talking about that right now. "
"1635790","1639170"," I go says maybe spy four or six four way into policy."
"1639290","1640870"," Then possible major dumps like again."
"1641370","1642450"," Everyone is too bold up. "
"1642570","1643690"," I don't agree with that at all."
"1645110","1646270"," They were too bold up."
"1647890","1649370"," I think you're going to see that. "
"1649530","1651090"," Yeah, I think you're going to see the push higher."
"1652150","1655370"," I think the I think that we're not bold up enough."
"1656030","1658090"," I think the trap is set for the bears. "
"1658870","1659270"," Personally."
"1660690","1662750"," Yes buyers and sellers are balanced."
"1663110","1663970"," Read the rest of the tweet. "
"1664190","1664470"," Absolutely."
"1665510","1666390"," I will face."
"1667570","1668410"," Poor badger. "
"1668670","1669190"," Bullard, I believe."
"1669730","1670110"," Let me see."
"1670370","1672330"," I don't know anyone that is unemployed. "
"1672870","1673430"," Yeah, no one's unemployed."
"1674950","1677090"," The numbers are really fucked up right now too."
"1677710","1678370"," Everyone's working. "
"1678910","1679850"," People working like crazy."
"1681730","1683150"," Issue is in rake height."
"1683330","1683990"," We know 50 issues. "
"1684510","1685550"," Does the terminal rate move higher?"
"1686130","1686590"," Is America not?"
"1686590","1688870"," So the terminal rate is coming down."
"1691410","1692270"," If you want to know."
"1693890","1695110"," What do you mean no rates?"
"1696170","1696950"," Like no rates. "
"1699470","1700470"," Like you."
"1700770","1701830"," There's a fair chance."
"1703010","1703850"," It's weird. "
"1704010","1707990"," You got people probably saying or throwing data around, right?"
"1709450","1711330"," And they're like, we're getting a stock market crash."
"1711890","1714170"," You do know what happens if we get a stock market crash, right?"
"1715650","1716810"," We do realize that."
"1716850","1718910"," You do realize that when you push publicly. "
"1719910","1720750"," Doom and gloom."
"1723960","1726920"," You can say, you know, we're saying all year, right?"
"1727020","1728240"," You know, we're on every time we're on a low."
"1728900","1729620"," You'll get. "
"1730360","1732240"," You're like black swan moved down."
"1732680","1734540"," You know what happens when you get the black swan, right?"
"1737960","1739360"," I don't know."
"1739600","1740720"," I don't know. "
"1740720","1743480"," I'm always flabbergasted with the."
"1744380","1745540"," One sided conversation."
"1746500","1748520"," You get a bear that says the stock market's going down. "
"1748740","1749500"," But then you tell the bear."
"1750060","1752200"," Well, if the stock market's going down, the rates are coming off, right?"
"1752560","1753100"," Like fully."
"1753960","1755360"," We're going back in the QA, right?"
"1755920","1759420"," And the crazy part is once you once you get that. "
"1760480","1762740"," You'll probably get it before the crash happens."
"1763480","1765240"," Some not always, but sometimes you will."
"1766120","1769000"," So you'll actually see no rates. "
"1770240","1772240"," They'll literally take the rates away."
"1772240","1775660"," There's zero in blast off QA."
"1776160","1778380"," It was kind of crazy. "
"1779960","1784400"," You know, good news or, or hawkish is, is bearish or."
"1785900","1788060"," Dovish is actually bearish."
"1789340","1791060"," And the vice versa. "
"1800510","1803650"," I'm sure that four zero five nine is 3600."
"1803710","1804110"," Good profit."
"1805930","1807210"," Before I got here late. "
"1807410","1808230"," Hey, where we roam?"
"1808390","1808590"," How are you?"
"1809470","1811550"," I'm pretty fucking sure up here at four, five, four, ten."
"1813470","1814350"," Yeah, I don't think it's."
"1814970","1816030"," You know, like, so chase the state. "
"1816170","1818250"," I'm pretty fucking short up here at four, five, four, ten."
"1818370","1820270"," Just put you on your own, right?"
"1821130","1822310"," You just call your broker."
"1822630","1826510"," Say, Hey, man, if we go up to like four fucking thirty four forty, am I going to get a"
"1826510","1826910"," call from you?"
"1828450","1829210"," Ask him that. "
"1831830","1832230"," Right?"
"1832470","1833810"," I mean, that's that's got to be your own question."
"1834590","1837270"," But you have to find out or how much money that's come up with."
"1839090","1839650"," That's on. "
"1840210","1840890"," Yeah, that's the."
"1841850","1843570"," The only idea I would say."
"1843850","1846490"," I guess you can pull the short off if we started climbing back up again. "
"1848530","1849610"," You can see the."
"1850310","1852230"," So the this morning when I posted."
"1855670","1857610"," This morning, I posted a tweet chase. "
"1859550","1865010"," And then that tweet showed a decent idea of what's going to happen."
"1865670","1870790"," Now, after the with the algorithm suggests afterwards, the sideways and down market into late"
"1870790","1875570"," twenty twenty three four S and P five hundred."
"1875850","1880010"," And it actually shows TLT fucking going crazy. "
"1880010","1884070"," And the other thing too, is I ran it on the DJI."
"1884550","1886210"," It's kind of like a slow roll over."
"1887050","1888030"," Through twenty twenty three. "
"1890630","1892770"," See, I would just say take that into account."
"1893750","1896930"," I would ask, I would call your broker and ask and see what they have to say."
"1897910","1903390"," Or maybe resize the short to carry it over into the end of twenty twenty three or something like"
"1903390","1903550"," that. "
"1908300","1909080"," Does that make sense?"
"1916070","1918430"," Yeah, so poor badgers asking about the line."
"1918690","1921390"," So remember, you've got this is a good question."
"1921530","1922270"," Poor badgers asking. "
"1922410","1925630"," You got to remember that you've got the FOMC chair, right?"
"1925770","1927270"," This is chair pal, right?"
"1928870","1931890"," And chair pal ultimately makes the decisions."
"1931970","1936390"," It's ultimately important for him to make a decision, right?"
"1937490","1938770"," And then you've got a fed heads."
"1938990","1943010"," You've got smaller presidents or little little income, whatever you want. "
"1943770","1946950"," And sometimes they dissent and sometimes they agree."
"1948450","1950630"," If too many of them decent, right?"
"1950990","1955690"," It can be bad for Jerome Powell, if he's ever called before a Senate hearing."
"1956730","1960290"," And then his decision goes against what the majority say. "
"1961870","1967570"," So you've got, and then you've got some of these smaller guys and men, whatever that there's"
"1967570","1969010"," sometimes they're in line with each other."
"1969010","1976590"," And oftentimes they'll get usually, hopefully, you'll get some on one side of the issue, some on"
"1976590","1977410"," the other side of the issue."
"1979030","1981270"," And Jerome will come back later and say it was data dependent, right?"
"1981690","1987790"," So it's a way to make excuses for, hey, I was wrong, but my whole committee, yeah, my whole"
"1987790","1989910"," committee or this happens all the time, right?"
"1991270","1992350"," That we're getting different. "
"1992730","2000010"," You see it in employment numbers, all kinds of fed release information that is all over the place"
"2000010","2000490"," right now."
"2000750","2005670"," It's very muddied and it's intentionally muddied so that they can come back and say, I was right or"
"2005670","2009370"," I was wrong and it kind of fits the narrative down the road, right?"
"2009550","2014390"," It's taking the blame off of signing blame, basically."
"2016090","2017090"," So yes, do they lie?"
"2017230","2018410"," You fucking a well, they lie. "
"2018610","2018910"," They lie."
"2019070","2019710"," They fucking lie."
"2020370","2022210"," Their ass is off when they need to. "
"2023110","2027910"," You'll notice when they come together and they're all on the same page that the data that's being"
"2027910","2032130"," released and what they're talking about is because they're all quite sure of what's going to"
"2032130","2032410"," happen."
"2032790","2033290"," So do they lie?"
"2033510","2033550"," Yes."
"2033750","2034390"," Do they muddy the waters?"
"2034710","2035430"," Yes, absolutely. "
"2035930","2037990"," Another thing you think that they don't, but they do."
"2042590","2044530"," But there's data out there."
"2044910","2047830"," We'll post, I've sent a post last week and I didn't. "
"2048310","2050710"," I'll post some charts for you guys from the, from the Fred."
"2051870","2054570"," That implies that fuck no, like they're lying."
"2054570","2058030"," They're 100% lying to you right now. "
"2058929","2060590"," The bond market's showing that."
"2061190","2062909"," The bond market's showing that."
"2064610","2066070"," The yields are showing that. "
"2066989","2070670"," Unemployment to an extent is muddied intentionally."
"2070969","2073650"," That's really the one that, that's really the one that I'm always watching."
"2073949","2077730"," That's my, you got to watch this right here. "
"2079310","2082850"," And there's, there's some conjunction charts you can watch it with too."
"2088820","2089840"," Yeah, it happens healthy."
"2090060","2093460"," You should have, it should be, I should be laying this stuff out for you before it ever happens. "
"2094219","2096820"," You should have expected to sell off on the bell this morning."
"2097540","2101920"," You should have expected, you should, if you're a bull, you should, you should want this."
"2102880","2104140"," I know that sounds insane. "
"2106020","2107400"," This is characteristic."
"2110340","2112540"," And as not surprisingly, we're in positive."
"2112740","2115660"," Well, I haven't checked to see if we're still in positive again, but I think we are. "
"2118930","2126270"," And it's interesting that we're hovering right around 401.95. We'll look at, let's take a look at."
"2128710","2129750"," Give me a second here."
"2132390","2133930"," I don't know if you can see it on this chart. "
"2134090","2134790"," I have it on another."
"2137450","2140270"," Sucks because I'm, you know, I'm fucking destroying this chart with."
"2140510","2141510"," Let's take a look right there. "
"2141550","2141970"," You see that?"
"2143350","2144290"," There's the pain in the ass."
"2144470","2145590"," Look at the bears."
"2145670","2146170"," We want right here. "
"2146290","2147490"," They want to close this gap down below."
"2147850","2148530"," That's what you're going to hear."
"2149050","2151070"," You can hear bears like we're closing this gap down here. "
"2151710","2153290"," Let's get some, let's get some cap."
"2155750","2156890"," But interesting, right?"
"2156990","2158850"," We're kind of just sitting right on this 200."
"2159890","2160350"," They may. "
"2160570","2163630"," I think that was an Acapens Alpha this morning as well, right?"
"2163770","2164210"," I told you."
"2164210","2166830"," To keep an eye on this level down below here."
"2166890","2169830"," I think give you a target down here of 401.65, I think. "
"2172470","2173670"," You'll have to look at it."
"2176010","2181230"," And I think we tagged 401.58. See it right down there."
"2182930","2185610"," I told you that was an important level to be looking at, right?"
"2185730","2186990"," We don't want to trade below that level. "
"2188830","2191710"," I told you to start worrying if we do trade to below that level."
"2191710","2194850"," If we do start worrying, trading below that level."
"2195170","2196370"," Hold on a second here. "
"2199100","2201860"," If you guys go to Acapens Alpha, you can see it."
"2202900","2211860"," I think I've put posted 401.65. Right down here, you want to have some concern."
"2213440","2215000"," Hold on a second here. "
"2215340","2216340"," We're next leg down."
"2217060","2218960"," We'll start looking at it."
"2218960","2219900"," It's like right here. "
"2221920","2222720"," Here's S1."
"2222960","2223900"," Here's S2 and S3."
"2224380","2226920"," If we want to make this next trip down here, right?"
"2227360","2232080"," This is the 200 A moving average, right?"
"2232200","2232820"," You'd like to see. "
"2233120","2233940"," You'd like to see."
"2234020","2237800"," I move under this if you're a bear for this next leg down, right?"
"2238560","2239480"," Break through this level."
"2240600","2242960"," And there's a couple of things you're looking for here. "
"2243360","2246460"," You want to take this level as a bear, but you also want to make sure that when you take"
"2246460","2252380"," this level below the 200 that we don't come down here, you want to capitalize on this trade, but"
"2252380","2255900"," then make sure that we don't have like a double bottom down here and start to break above to"
"2255900","2257820"," recapture that 200 MA."
"2258120","2258560"," Does that make sense?"
"2259580","2260340"," Do you guys out there?"
"2263510","2264050"," Hold on here."
"2264350","2264750"," Let me just take it. "
"2266950","2271170"," I should have put this level in here today, and I will right now."
"2272010","2276990"," This level will change to or was it 40165, I think?"
"2280060","2281260"," I'll put that one in."
"2281440","2282820"," This is going to be a moving target. "
"2283620","2285540"," It's not going to stay constant."
"2287080","2290220"," It's not going to show up on this chart either."
"2291140","2297440"," We'll write it in there and we'll try to eyeball it into tomorrow. "
"2301160","2303680"," Daily moving average, simple moving average."
"2304120","2305680"," You guys prefer SMA."
"2307160","2308320"," Maybe that's more standard. "
"2311520","2312840"," We'll keep our eyes on this."
"2313080","2315740"," This opens the door probably to these lower levels."
"2315960","2316720"," That's two S3. "
"2318300","2321000"," I'm going to put it back in one day chart over here."
"2321420","2325320"," I'll bring back the book map so you can see it."
"2328580","2329580"," Give me a second here. "
"2341510","2342730"," Chase, I think you can."
"2343250","2347070"," I don't think it's a bad chase that you took the short up above."
"2347350","2348430"," I think the short is fine. "
"2349210","2353250"," The only question as usual chase is how long you're going to hold on to it for."
"2354910","2356130"," It's not that we can't."
"2356210","2361250"," It's not that we can't sell down to the depths of hell before we even get there. "
"2362090","2365750"," I think there's at least three or four chances for us to do that this year."
"2365750","2366910"," Or 2024."
"2367730","2369190"," There's a couple shots at it. "
"2369990","2375090"," I think it's February and end of April, April 31st or something."
"2375310","2378470"," I think even have exact dates like February 23rd."
"2378810","2384010"," I haven't talked about that publicly yet, but I think it's like February 23rd and then March 31st. "
"2384650","2389590"," And then the next opportunity for it would be I think November 18th."
"2389730","2393190"," And then at some time in, I believe January of 2024."
"2394230","2398390"," So it's just a matter of how long you want to hold it, how long you can't hold it, that"
"2398390","2398790"," kind of stuff. "
"2399850","2406050"," And you guys have got access to these tools so you guys can see what I'm talking about."
"2406190","2406710"," They do change."
"2407750","2413010"," One thing that these tools don't account for is there's a couple of things these tools don't"
"2413010","2413570"," account for. "
"2414510","2417330"," A lot of them know is market events like a bingo card."
"2418690","2420010"," It doesn't account."
"2420190","2421330"," We don't know unemployment numbers. "
"2421550","2422230"," We don't know yield."
"2422470","2424190"," We don't know FMC meetings."
"2424250","2425470"," We don't know about the Ukraine war. "
"2425950","2428370"," We don't know about presidential and political candidates."
"2429690","2431610"," Those events will reset."
"2434110","2435230"," Reset expectations. "
"2438790","2440010"," As a matter of fact, Mike."
"2440750","2444310"," Mike Wilson said something about this specific thing."
"2445050","2449890"," If we trade too high into the beginning of the year, we're going to come back into the market to"
"2449890","2450710"," short back down again. "
"2451670","2453390"," They're not actively shorting right now."
"2453470","2454490"," They're looking for a high."
"2455910","2460470"," I'm assuming it's somewhere between four three hundred and four four hundred. "
"2461190","2463610"," I think forty four two hundred."
"2463670","2467090"," There's a gap to fill, but I think they're looking to get out on a high."
"2468610","2469910"," No, they're not actively short. "
"2470090","2472350"," I don't think large banks are actively shorting the market right now."
"2472790","2474070"," I think it's a bunch of standing orders."
"2474390","2476430"," I want to tell us the chase specifically. "
"2477890","2479750"," I think that there's a shit ton."
"2482290","2483090"," Of orders."
"2483750","2488010"," Hey, I mean, I mean, I mean, if you're a bear out there, I want to tell you something. "
"2488230","2488370"," Okay."
"2490710","2491710"," Give me a second here."
"2492990","2501660"," If you're a bear out there, I think right now that there are a bunch of shorts here. "
"2502600","2503560"," Like clockwork."
"2504140","2505500"," And they're like slamming the button."
"2508680","2510980"," But I think the big money is up here. "
"2512760","2513940"," They're somewhere up here."
"2514660","2516800"," And so you're not going to get the fall through that you're looking for."
"2518520","2522960"," I think they're waiting for some something up here in December, January. "
"2524980","2528860"," It doesn't mean they can't come into the market if we start slowing down and jump in here."
"2530420","2533500"," If you can trade down low enough, but I don't think that they're there right now."
"2534320","2535940"," It's not showing that they're there either there. "
"2536120","2539220"," Just so you guys know, I don't know if you know this, but there are."
"2539820","2542960"," I don't know what I don't know what it's called right now, but there's like a short chart."
"2543620","2544880"," It's like asked something one. "
"2545600","2550760"," It shows how much of the market is being shorted and that's not showing the banks in right now."
"2552120","2557880"," Not like it showed them in here, here and here."
"2558880","2560300"," They're not actively in the market. "
"2560920","2561680"," That data is available."
"2562720","2564160"," I don't know if he has no that or not."
"2564340","2565840"," I'll try to find the ticker for that. "
"2566700","2569980"," I think it's like, I want to say it's like S one or something."
"2570260","2570540"," I don't know."
"2570840","2571780"," I don't look at it that often. "
"2571900","2576040"," I looked at it last week and I didn't see the shorts in the market."
"2576380","2578240"," The big money shorts like big fucking banks."
"2578240","2581100"," They're not data wise. "
"2581300","2585900"," They're not on the market like they were or have been in previous cycles."
"2587100","2588220"," They could enter, I guess."
"2588740","2590020"," Maybe they entered and I don't know today. "
"2590920","2591240"," I don't know."
"2591700","2592040"," I haven't checked."
"2592280","2592820"," I can check. "
"2594000","2594280"," If you like."
"2598340","2605760"," But when I checked, when I when I did check last week, they weren't in the market."
"2607040","2609160"," You can usually see when they're when they're in the market. "
"2611720","2612900"," Okay, so there's our two."
"2616760","2618040"," Just be conscious of that."
"2618160","2618620"," If you're a bear. "
"2622330","2623890"," You don't you don't want to get fucked up."
"2626430","2627370"," See you guys in."
"2632350","2634610"," XLE family shouldn't the bad breakdown of topping triangle. "
"2636750","2639110"," Yeah, you know, I was on vacation this weekend."
"2639110","2643170"," One of my wife and kids around vacation wanted me to come spend some time with them."
"2645030","2645910"," And I."
"2648970","2651190"," Topically saw what was going on with oil in Russia. "
"2652870","2655170"," And I meant to spend more time on it and didn't."
"2658550","2659870"," So take a look below."
"2661270","2662470"," See if we can break through. "
"2665940","2670120"," Oh, there he goes."
"2670500","2671240"," Oh, look at that."
"2673640","2675080"," 3990 baby. "
"2678360","2679080"," 3990."
"2679740","2681540"," Look at that."
"2681660","2683140"," It's just like a magnet down there. "
"2684100","2685800"," See that magnet down there."
"2687340","2688140"," Anybody want to."
"2688680","2690900"," Oh, we also have the contract roll coming up, right?"
"2691300","2693660"," Isn't that like, is that the 15th or 16th?"
"2693980","2694660"," Yes, contract. "
"2695700","2697320"," Has everybody rolled yet or no?"
"2698300","2699440"," I haven't done that either."
"2699440","2700240"," I haven't checked the role."
"2702600","2704300"," I think that's coming up this week. "
"2706970","2707790"," I don't know what the."
"2709550","2711910"," I think it's a dollar 30 in spying."
"2712230","2713930"," Yes, right now, but I could be wrong on that. "
"2723500","2725100"," Look at that beautiful tag down below."
"2725340","2726080"," You guys see it down below."
"2727800","2730860"," So we'll keep watching to see if we can trade trade down there this morning. "
"2734280","2736420"," Just got added to Captain's Apple."
"2736460","2736940"," Take a look."
"2737060","2737240"," Thanks. "
"2737400","2738440"," I'll put you on there right now."
"2739280","2741180"," Let me take a look at something here."
"2742460","2743060"," I'm just saying. "
"2743880","2745720"," I'll check happens out for right now for you."
"2746080","2749940"," And if you request it, I'll put you in there and you can read the note from this morning."
"2758260","2759560"," What am I doing wrong here?"
"2759640","2760300"," I'm doing something wrong. "
"2763480","2764600"," I think tighter guys."
"2772020","2776580"," All right, so I just let a bunch more people in so you can read that note from this morning."
"2781740","2782700"," 40 102. "

"3318680","3319760"," It went my way, but never paid. "
"3320440","3323400"," And I figured out I had to get like monthlies or three month out contracts."
"3324400","3327760"," And it started going my way, but it wasn't printing and I got so bored with it."
"3327780","3328180"," Like a weekend. "
"3328420","3329180"," I was like, fuck this."
"3329360","3329940"," Close them out."
"3330600","3335540"," And then of course it blasted off and eventually paid the fuck out of those puts or calls or the"
"3335540","3336780"," fuck they were, but I had to hold them. "
"3337060","3339460"," It was like, it was like a bunch of old guys sitting around a fucking."

"3482360","3484340"," It's kind of showing this might be it."
"3486240","3491000"," Some stuff I'm looking at showing this might be it for the week, the low, but because you've come"
"3491000","3491960"," down so far so fast."
"3492080","3493800"," But dude, I swear I want to see. "

"3547570","3548750"," 1.6 million. "
"3549050","3552890"," It's not great, but we'll see if this is the bottom."
"3553030","3554930"," This might be as this develops."
"3556070","3557850"," This could be a momentary bottom. "

"3747340","3749880"," They expect the S&P to resume declines after the next cross above."
"3749880","3753760"," It's 200 moving the average last week saying the downtrend since the beginning of the year remains"
"3753760","3754160"," intact."
"3754160","3756860"," This makes the risk we were playing for more upside quite poor at this point. "
"3757700","3760340"," You guys all know that Mike Wilson is a contrarian."
"3761040","3763840"," The trader just want to point that out to you."
"3764740","3767060"," The call marks the shift in Wilson's view recently. "
"3767940","3772220"," His last week when he said the tax recovery could continue to December for coming under pressure"
"3772220","3773720"," from weaker corporate earnings next year."
"3774560","3776040"," Number one of the latest institutional investors."
"3776040","3785660"," Monday he now sees absolute upside for the SB 541.50. About 2% of our current levels, which could"
"3785660","3787320"," be achieved over the next week or so. "
"3788200","3793620"," So he's still saying there's could be another push higher, but his targets have definitely changed."
"3793620","3795200"," He had much higher targets."
"3796660","3806020"," The strategist and a loaner is passing as the view of the U.S. stocks for early next year. "
"3810440","3814060"," With both economic growth and inflation cooling next year, Wilson recommends retaining defensive"
"3814060","3815100"," positioning in health care."
"3815620","3816840"," Utilities and consumer state stocks."
"3817320","3821640"," Growth stocks which generally benefit from lower rates and likely to see much of a boost in 2023. "
"3822340","3823420"," Given the risk of court prophecy."
"3823640","3827100"," Yeah, this is the part that I was trying to say on Twitter."
"3827400","3828320"," Twitter this weekend was. "
"3831020","3834440"," To have a small small basket of tech."
"3835320","3836900"," Mostly because it'll get pumped."
"3837860","3838980"," Has nothing to do with. "
"3840960","3844580"," Has nothing to do with why why it shouldn't go up."
"3848180","3853180"," So he's seen 4404 or 4015 as top."
"3854140","3856700"," So let's look at that at that trade. "
"3858600","3859920"," Let's see what he's saying here."
"3867740","3869580"," So this are three area pairs."
"3869720","3872340"," What he's saying for December to expect no higher than here. "
"3873780","3877640"," We're previously there was there were some way way way way targets."
"3879660","3883180"," This is the 420 gap bill that we had."
"3883800","3888660"," And then maybe it was up here was the gap of the look on a different timeframe, I think. "
"3890540","3892720"," I don't know why I'm not showing gaps on this right now."
"3893660","3895040"," Some reason I'm not showing gaps."
"3895220","3896300"," Usually this shows gaps. "
"3897420","3898220"," Let's write up here."
"3898600","3900420"," The gap is at 425 to 427."
"3903040","3905900"," So there was this range in an extension up here to 440. "
"3908180","3911100"," And he's saying now that he's saying now he's an active seller."
"3911500","3912720"," And even if we were to go high."
"3913680","3914320"," To expect no more. "
"3914440","3915240"," That's not that much right."
"3915380","3916500"," That would be more of a relief bounce."
"3918460","3921300"," And continuation down that's the max that he's giving. "
"3922360","3925900"," Something like this and then and then continuation down the market."
"3926060","3927100"," So that's a market change."
"3928920","3931140"," That's an that's interesting that he said that this morning. "
"3931980","3933580"," Good job over posted that."
"3934280","3935400"," I like Mike Wilson."
"3936980","3938780"," He's a he's a fucking gangster. "
"3942360","3943820"," And he matters too."
"3944080","3945460"," Well, he matters in terms of."
"3945460","3949060"," He matters in terms of the big money in the market. "
"3961430","3962850"," Total bear porn on IWM."
"3970200","3971420"," Which so the research."
"3971660","3973400"," So his last research research note. "
"3974000","3975120"," Well, he had an interview."
"3977080","3978980"," The second bounce in October."
"3979520","3983200"," He didn't get he didn't catch the eight the 13th and he got like the 18th or something. "
"3983200","3985100"," Came out and said he was long the market."
"3986100","3987560"," And then he had an interview."
"3988240","3991700"," I want to say last week for the week before. "
"3993200","3994740"," And I want to say it was on."
"3995340","3996640"," It was on it wasn't on like CNBC."
"3996960","4000040"," It was on Bloomberg or Fox business or something. "
"4000720","4001640"," I have the interview."
"4001860","4003360"," I could I could post it."
"4004700","4006200"," I'll post the last interview. "
"4009670","4013690"," And he had a an interview where he said he was long the market up to."
"4013690","4015610"," I want to say 430 or 440."
"4016670","4022430"," And so that note this morning from him that note was published by Morgan Stanley this morning. "
"4024210","4026370"," That would definitely put it down or definitely."
"4027230","4029130"," Have put a reaction on the market."
"4030690","4049380"," And let it"
"4049380","4049380"," out. "
"4059380","4060720"," Yes, they didn't want to look at something."
"4120170","4121310"," Yes, I've got this."
"4121450","4125729"," I've got this in the 15 minute as a targeted by zone and then I've got further decline down to. "

"4139819","4142220"," It's calls for a trench trench change lower. "
"4144920","4145939"," It's pretty nasty."
"4213720","4217920"," I'm just reading the ISM services PMI."
"4233600","4234480"," That's interesting. "
"4234920","4235680"," The PMI actually."
"4238520","4240080"," PMI is very positive."
"4292760","4297720"," One eighty three seventy on Tesla this morning down five point three one percent. "
"4312490","4314950"," To bring some of the stuff that will take a look around the market."
"4332480","4333880"," Bloodbath and XLE, huh?"
"4345170","4347990"," They have a gap lower to fill it 87 and some change or something."
"4349770","4350690"," So we're looking at USO. "
"4352570","4354370"," If you look at USO 2 BNO."

"4620720","4622600"," It's a big area of volatility in here. "
"4623120","4624780"," But if you start breaking this stuff here."

"4658950","4660470"," No matter what Michael's and says. "
"4661350","4662130"," Or they say about."
"4662890","4664750"," Or they say about a market."
"4666110","4667630"," It's a good J&K. "
"4668690","4672010"," We'll look for divergence in here today in J&K and TLT."
"4676120","4678640"," If you want tech take off in 2023."
"4679700","4682160"," So if you want to see tech take off in 2023. "
"4682500","4683480"," You're going to need to see."
"4684560","4686700"," J&K not just move up here but."
"4687620","4688140"," Continue. "
"4689580","4690380"," This climb."
"4690560","4692060"," If you see J&K come down."
"4693220","4696740"," And you see TLT come up into 2023. "
"4697360","4701700"," It's going to point towards stag stagflation and recession type stuff."
"4702600","4704180"," So we'll look at TLT."
"4704860","4705980"," We'll compare the two. "
"4706820","4708940"," I'll bring up a different chart a different platform."
"4709860","4711000"," And we'll look at J&K."
"4712000","4714460"," H.Y.G. of course rolling over still in track though. "
"4715080","4716460"," Nothing broken here yet."
"4716740","4717340"," There's nothing broken."
"4717780","4719100"," There's no reason to be. "
"4720260","4722940"," Like super gnarly bearish at this point."
"4729300","4731080"," There's still nothing broken here."
"4732120","4734300"," You want to break through this. "
"4736300","4737480"," This trend up."
"4737700","4741200"," And even then you can only trade this down here because you can see what's happened before."
"4741860","4742240"," Come up. "
"4742560","4742860"," Come up."
"4743240","4743540"," Come up."
"4744220","4744560"," Come up. "
"4745260","4745560"," Come up."
"4747500","4749180"," So you trade this down."
"4749460","4751720"," If you break this play and you trade it down but. "
"4752420","4755720"," You want out of that trade because if you don't get out of that trade this happens again."
"4756640","4757620"," You're going to get fucked right."
"4757920","4760920"," You got you get fucked once twice three times. "
"4760920","4763130"," Four times five times."
"4764500","4765580"," Six times."
"4766420","4768280"," So does it mean we break through here possible. "
"4769080","4771440"," But you know you still level level."
"4773480","4774020"," Bearishness."
"4774500","4777130"," You'd want to see a break of this for super bearishness. "
"4778240","4779500"," You want like that super bear."
"4779760","4780900"," It's a break here."
"4783860","4787480"," You want that like confirmation when you're walking around you get to bear suit. "
"4787480","4791660"," Is break this down here because if you don't break this down here you can't get super bearish."
"4791860","4792680"," This just isn't it."
"4792920","4795160"," It's even told seven times no. "
"4796260","4797700"," So you need to have that break."
"4799560","4801560"," That's okay still still viable."
"4803480","4804000"," Vicks. "
"4804780","4805860"," That's the one day."
"4811360","4813460"," Big old fucking fat gap down here."

"5539720","5542420"," You'll see you'll see it'll just be just like this."
"5543000","5546100"," Then you straight back in a business again the bears got what they wanted. "
"5546100","5548920"," And then we're back off and running higher again."
"5549280","5551880"," Be careful of if you're if you're a bull out there."
"5552860","5554680"," I would not be buying this. "
"5556660","5561160"," Unless you see a fucking five to 15 million by down here."
"5561560","5564220"," Be real real wary of this down here."
"5565280","5567520"," Into into the clothes and it's tomorrow. "
"5569180","5570360"," That's what I would suspect."
"5572360","5574320"," I'm going to give that a pretty high probability."
"5574320","5575560"," I'm going to bet that there's. "
"5576360","5579220"," Mike Wilson coming out this morning and saying that shit on a Monday."

"5595200","5597360"," Yeah, it looks like it looks like one of these."
"5597480","5598520"," This looks like a hit and run."
"5599020","5600640"," It looks like a bag job. "
"5602020","5603120"," Bank job or something."
"5603560","5604700"," Whatever the fuck you want to call it."
"5610460","5612960"," I'm gonna be I'm fascinated to see how we close today. "

"5615500","5617860"," And we're below just so you know, this is bearish."
"5618660","5621160"," Well, currently it is broke below the. "
"5624710","5626950"," So here's here's VWAP."
"5627070","5628910"," Now, of course, the longer we stretch."
"5630730","5632630"," The more chance we get to it. "
"5633130","5635110"," But just on an intraday kind of a thing."
"5635890","5639010"," This break below the 200 SMA over here."
"5639790","5640790"," Is bearish, right?"
"5640970","5643790"," You come back up, you retest the 200 SMA. "
"5644790","5646890"," Right came broke below 200 SMA."
"5647270","5654190"," And we tested it and answers gradual departure from the U.S. And it's telling you know, that we're"
"5654190","5655050"," going lower down here."
"5655050","5657030"," So this, you know, this move right here bears. "
"5657030","5658590"," By to the tick."

"5665770","5669770"," So a decision comes after more than 18 months of good faith dialogue with U.S. state and federal"
"5669770","5671930"," regulators, which has come to a dead end."
"5673070","5675310"," So sold away from you guys aren't seeing this stuff."
"5675630","5676650"," Let me bring this over for you. "
"5677450","5680290"," So just so you guys can see this morning."
"5683390","5686230"," Sold it down below VWAP right right off the belt."
"5686530","5688590"," Came back up to VWAP, rejected one more time. "
"5689390","5691630"," Came down to the 200 and broke through."
"5693130","5696610"," And then came up right and rejected once more off VWAP."
"5696630","5697730"," And you're rejecting like this off. "
"5697890","5699170"," This is the bearish setup, right?"
"5699530","5700150"," Same as the bull setup."
"5700830","5702310"," See, you come down here, right?"
"5702310","5704130"," You come back up to the 200 SMA."
"5704490","5707270"," The moment that it was rejected tells you that it wants to head lower. "
"5708030","5710550"," And we're likely going to see at least that."
"5712230","5712710"," 3990."
"5714430","5717990"," So we'll watch it as it trades down and tries to tag that lower level. "
"5718470","5723390"," We want to see into this into this close if there's some kind of a bullshit like this."
"5723830","5727370"," And then we get that further declined on Tuesday."
"5728330","5732430"," This would be the beautiful setup on Tuesday for 392. "
"5733110","5737490"," I'm going to assume this is zero, zero gamma for that 3990 is."
"5744530","5746030"," Where's Tesla right now?"
"5747010","5751310"," Did it hit the kind of target like 180 for Tesla today?"
"5751430","5752050"," It's at 183."
"5753530","5758790"," Found stuff, 183.30. I think I had 180 on Tesla for today. "
"5761430","5762250"," Still not there."

"5808770","5810650"," The bears here want to. "
"5812050","5813550"," They broke through it here."
"5814130","5815650"," They want to start like."
"5817010","5818370"," They want to keep that going. "
"5818470","5819050"," They want to keep that."
"5819190","5822050"," This is a big zone right now for bears to hold on to."
"5823390","5826530"," So they can break down into this channel and start working their way down. "
"5829050","5829650"," Hold on."
"5829830","5830230"," Give me a second."
"5830310","5831950"," I got my getting a bunch of text messages. "

"5861840","5863120"," I might grab some puts if I can."
"5865200","5866940"," I'd like to see if you're a bear. "
"5867220","5871480"," If you have missed any of this trade so far this morning, there's a couple of places you can look."
"5871480","5872660"," Same from a next."

"6050700","6054180"," the robots close at higher or lower. "
"6057420","6059200"," This is certainly bearish without a doubt."
"6061260","6062940"," They want to hold this under you."
"6063020","6068280"," They want to hold the head of the bulls underneath here for the lower to the lower open tomorrow on"
"6068280","6068540"," Tuesday. "
"6069600","6071560"," And that brings up your turnaround Tuesday, right?"
"6072020","6072800"," I think that's what I posted."
"6073060","6077960"," I think they either talked about that or on Friday or I posted or I was like, you get Friday"
"6077960","6079420"," down Monday, Tuesday down."
"6080040","6083720"," I thought it could take to the end of the week, but it's happening faster, which is fine. "
"6084080","6088320"," Don't give a fine fuck how long it takes to hold it under and get that."
"6089200","6091980"," Get that fucking get some fucking VIX up there, man."
"6092140","6094900"," You can't make a run higher without the VIX a little bit higher. "
"6095020","6097860"," You need some some selling here."
"6098540","6099960"," It's not going to be straight up."
"6100760","6102720"," I'm not going to the bears yet either, so we'll see. "
"6103580","6105420"," We'll see how we'll see how this day closes."
"6106700","6109860"," I mean, I have no problem taking a fucking foot in here."
"6110400","6112220"," Something like that in the bell would be beautiful. "
"6114800","6115680"," I would love that trade."
"6117820","6119520"," There should be some money on that trade."
"6121240","6122040"," Let me see here. "
"6123460","6126360"," Our cash and was saying 45 close didn't close below Friday."
"6126580","6127420"," My close below today."
"6127600","6130460"," The spot cam will probably be like now we are going down. "
"6130800","6131600"," They don't have the long."
"6131840","6132820"," Yeah, that's I agree with that."
"6132920","6133940"," The spot cam is shit is. "
"6136540","6138880"," They're all they're not always they're pretty good."
"6139100","6139840"," They're pretty good."
"6140080","6141160"," Like they're pretty good. "
"6141500","6143560"," And then whenever the markets move quickly."
"6144500","6145640"," They're all fucked up."
"6145840","6150120"," I was talking winky last week and I said if they did a better job of coming out. "
"6151740","6153580"," Like to be a prime example."
"6153920","6160600"," The spot cam should be like to the subscribers and probably publicly should be like, Hey, look, our"
"6160600","6161840"," models have changed this morning."
"6162680","6164660"," These are some important numbers for you to look at. "
"6165060","6165860"," Yeah, we didn't."
"6166020","6168280"," It was in our last note, but we didn't highlight it."
"6168560","6171300"," And so we want to bring that forward to the highlight of our note. "
"6172160","6174320"," I think that would be important for the subscribers."
"6175780","6177780"," And they don't they don't do that, which is a problem."
"6179060","6181540"," And then that's and what that's what Chase is saying. "
"6181540","6182220"," Chase is saying."
"6182600","6184120"," I think this is what Chase is saying is."
"6185080","6188600"," You know, so so so if there if what's important changes. "
"6189440","6193400"," And then so let's say, you know, we close here and we're winky saying to."
"6194700","6199700"," Then, you know, if you would see further decline into the open tomorrow and then by the time you"
"6199700","6201040"," get your note from a company like."
"6201300","6202240"," Like the company. "
"6203420","6204780"," This moves already done."
"6206360","6208860"," And they're telling you, you know, we're super bearish here."
"6209300","6214100"," Now, even if we are bearish here, if we turn into negative gamma, the key is you'll see violent"
"6214100","6214700"," moves up. "
"6215400","6218640"," So you could see like an open tomorrow, we blast the fuck up."
"6219100","6220060"," At least to here."
"6220200","6220840"," That's a huge move. "
"6221340","6223740"," And if we were to close the all the gap, right?"
"6223920","6226540"," A pair you talk about a giant fucking one day move."
"6226640","6228220"," So you see the violence that takes place."
"6229220","6232320"," When you're when you switch the negative gamma, right?"
"6232800","6238340"," So, you know, again, it's like a day late in a dollar short and you're not positioned again, right?"
"6238960","6243340"," Especially if you're like a new trader, like fucking short right here and the move is higher. "
"6243580","6246580"," Now you're upside down on the next move lower."
"6247260","6248380"," So I don't know."
"6250580","6251360"," That's a good point. "
"6254160","6255440"," We're 10, 10 cents."
"6255580","6256020"," I'll take shot."
"6256380","6256580"," Do them. "
"6257740","6258380"," Nothing to motivate."
"6258620","6261320"," So I was like seeing gains lost as a boy hedge into the possibility."
"6261320","6263360"," I have to still on the main wedge. "
"6263660","6264340"," They keep running it."
"6264720","6267940"," So does that mean we zero eight four fours and then sell them before close."
"6268000","6270600"," Oh, well, yeah, no, I'd get a personal. "
"6270960","6277960"," Well, this my assumption is going to be my assumption is going to be that we're going to sell down."
"6278860","6282880"," Whoever this three nine nine zero is you're going to get a move higher and then they're going to"
"6282880","6283940"," sell it back into the close."
"6285720","6286460"," Something something. "
"6286540","6288340"," Oh, wait a minute, you guys can't see this shit."
"6298880","6301880"," So you should be entering some volatility down in here."
"6301920","6303560"," Anyways, you nail this, right?"
"6304120","6304940"," You get a relief rally. "
"6305080","6306580"," Everyone's like, fuck yeah, I'm bullish."
"6307520","6311660"," They try to close it below the 200 SMA right down here."
"6311660","6314600"," This would be what I think it's somewhere to hear here. "
"6314660","6319400"," It's like somewhere in here is where if you weren't already taking puts off the bell."
"6319840","6324340"," There's somewhere up in here worth buying puts on for tomorrow expiry."
"6324720","6328480"," I think it's a long shot trade. "
"6328720","6334100"," But if you had like a if you look at tomorrow's puts for down here."
"6336180","6338300"," Like three and I wouldn't I would get them more in the money."
"6338400","6341940"," You want to get puts up here for like three like 400 P or something. "
"6342620","6345520"," Up in here and hopefully they would slam it down."
"6345580","6348580"," You make like three or four five hundred percent in that trade."
"6349280","6350740"," I would time it would be key. "
"6352140","6353060"," Unless they start blood."
"6353280","6354020"," Unless they do it in this."
"6354160","6355140"," Like if they did this today. "
"6356360","6357040"," That'd be wild."
"6357640","6358560"," You can't see that."
"6358720","6359900"," If they did this today, it'd be wild. "
"6361320","6363000"," But usually it doesn't happen."
"6363000","6364420"," Usually it'll get like a fake out."
"6364900","6366020"," Everybody's cool and calm. "
"6366240","6367100"," Then it comes in the overnight."
"6367480","6370000"," Not always, but sometimes you will."
"6376690","6379310"," But there's no fucking way I'm taking a trap down in here. "
"6380190","6381110"," I'm not taking any fun."
"6381250","6382370"," I'm not taking no traps down here."
"6383250","6384270"," I know how this goes. "
"6385610","6388890"," Now this goes you're by puts and then it fucking slams up and you're fucked."
"6396520","6397200"," Thoughts cap."
"6397500","6398060"," I missed that part. "
"6398360","6399040"," What's this thoughts cap?"
"6399040","6399860"," I keep missing with."
"6400660","6402180"," Okay, so who's asking?"
"6402920","6404620"," PPI Wednesday wouldn't surprise me."
"6404660","6406340"," If up again, of course they want to maximize profit. "
"6406640","6407040"," The luck increases."
"6407660","6409220"," That's my slight put spreads early today."
"6409900","6410580"," Put spreads. "
"6411820","6412640"," You know, the."
"6413580","6415720"," I don't mind that trade either chase."
"6416040","6418880"," I like what Mike was saying this morning. "
"6419660","6423180"," Which was I think hand are targeted like utilities."
"6424520","6428940"," I don't know what the other two were, but I know that those were leaders last week and week before"
"6428940","6431600"," he targeted three leaders to put put spreads on."
"6437680","6441300"," I asked to spread kind of sex from two word because we think we'll blow 85. "
"6442100","6443640"," Yeah, well, you know what I want to talk."
"6443760","6444820"," I got something to talk to you guys about."
"6445900","6446620"," Hold on here. "
"6449820","6451020"," Give me a second."
"6453140","6455080"," When you guys have a free moment."
"6456160","6457120"," Just a second here. "
"6459780","6461640"," When you guys have a free moment."
"6462160","6462800"," Where's that?"
"6468200","6469680"," Why is this not showing up?"
"6479160","6480380"," We just saying here."
"6485750","6487670"," I'm going to look on another computer. "
"6487910","6488150"," Hold on."
"6533290","6535450"," So I just posted a link."
"6564840","6566540"," So I just posted a link to. "
"6567460","6569740"," On that captain's off, I just posted a link."
"6570240","6572560"," And I've got a couple more for you to look at for."
"6574800","6577820"," The Greeks went to enter and I have a Greek calculator. "
"6578480","6580520"," That gives you I'll post that too."
"6580760","6583340"," It's I have to dig it out, but I've got a Greek calculator that shows you."
"6584240","6590460"," High high percentage chances for spreads and single options. "
"6592120","6593120"," In the in the Greek."
"6593240","6594260"," There's a book to you can read."
"6594460","6595540"," I forget the name of the book right now. "
"6596080","6596920"," I'll get you."
"6596920","6600920"," Link to the book to read."
"6604920","6606360"," Or options Greeks. "
"6610440","6610920"," And then."
"6615430","6620500"," I'll tell you what."
"6624930","6626510"," I want that trade. "
"6626790","6628070"," I'm getting getting getting."
"6628070","6628870"," I'm getting taste."
"6629130","6630510"," I'm getting tasty right now. "
"6633910","6635330"," I just posted a link."
"6636010","6637130"," It's from Yale University."
"6638750","6641170"," And it's probably the one of the best. "
"6644550","6645510"," Options explainers."
"6645610","6648210"," If you're a new trader too, if you're an old trader, you should watch it."
"6648830","6651210"," The guy goes into the mechanics of options. "
"6651910","6656490"," So that's a simple way for you to watch mechanics of something about mechanics of options."
"6656770","6658930"," And then I've got a book for you to read."
"6660310","6662510"," That if you've never read this book. "
"6663010","6664770"," I fucking don't know why I can't."
"6667730","6670090"," I can't come with a book fucking name of the book."
"6671550","6673410"," It's been a matter of fact. "
"6673650","6674010"," I have to get."
"6674330","6675590"," I have it on e-book."
"6675810","6676950"," I think I have it downloaded. "
"6678110","6681230"," So if I have a link to the if I have a link to the download that I can share,"
"6681230","6681690"," I will."
"6682410","6683690"," So you can just download it."
"6683950","6684730"," I think it's free. "
"6685830","6686570"," It's an older book."
"6687650","6690150"," I think it's from like the 1970s."
"6691150","6692780"," Don't quote me on that could be the 1960s. "
"6694260","6697260"," Like 1967 if I got it right or somewhere in there."
"6697720","6700060"," But it's one of the best books and options you can get."
"6700260","6700840"," I think in my view. "
"6702800","6706020"," So you can back test for at least."
"6706600","6708940"," And I've got a I've got this cool little calculator."
"6709680","6711620"," So you can run your your stuff through it. "
"6711660","6715460"," And if it matches up to these Greeks, you can be like, Oh, this is a."
"6716740","6718520"," My chance of profit or high."
"6719240","6719980"," On this trade."
"6724950","6725710"," In change. "
"6726370","6727190"," I'm like a bull."
"6728190","6729690"," No, my opinion is not changed."
"6730270","6733210"," Dixie looking like hold over one of five. "
"6734710","6736630"," We don't close redemptions on your reach."
"6736850","6737710"," Yeah, exactly."
"6738070","6738450"," I saw that. "
"6739270","6741730"," I saw the redemptions being closed and reads last week."
"6744550","6745550"," Where's that money going?"
"6752950","6753670"," I'm just going to see."
"6754590","6755850"," Keep how the dub began. "
"6756770","6757450"," How do they get in?"
"6757630","6758650"," How do they expected that?"
"6758770","6759690"," I don't know if the judge would know."
"6763750","6765110"," Transport shows on book map."
"6765670","6766730"," If that breaks back and hard. "
"6767830","6768630"," It would be interesting."
"6769030","6769450"," I can see massively."
"6770130","6771410"," I'm trying to read all the way. "
"6771570","6773190"," You guys are saying about the channel."
"6773430","6777770"," But the last one, which is coming soon will bounce and will roll over in this panic and rejection"
"6777770","6778330"," of the."
"6778330","6779730"," In top of times. "
"6781810","6782870"," Inflation is bullish."
"6783730","6785190"," We might have print on inflation."
"6785630","6785710"," Change. "
"6786790","6787450"," We're laughing."

"7923020","7929380"," the, um The market being so overbought it doesn't account for Uh, so I think that there's some"
"7929380","7936040"," problems with it Uh, and I said I don't want to use it unless Um, I don't want to use"
"7936040","7941200"," it unless it's a high rate or I can at least put some rules in In conjunctions they look you"

"7984780","7989280"," saying to you regardless if we continue to go down You're gonna expect to squeeze higher, but we"

"8690340","8695380"," a path So if you're looking for a path of where we should go you can be like hey look"
"8695380","8700520"," This is you know, I can chart this all day long Near term gas price assumptions and all prices are"
"8700520","8700720"," unchanged."

"8706760","8713480"," bird regression stuff and see like Uh There's a probability that we go in this path if we break"
"8713480","8719840"," this path that's going to recalculate Um a different move so like you can only put so much or you"
"8719840","8726160"," can only um It's it's only so good So so if you just go out there and be like yeah,"

"8839930","8843730"," go down from there Oh, the agos going to recalculate and this is a bullshit. "
"8843750","8845030"," I'll go on that time frame."
"8845290","8853810"," The second thing The second thing you'd have to say on that algo would be Let me mute this for"
"8853810","8860350"," a minute here The same thing you'd have to say in that algo is Uh, you know, it's it's not"
"8860350","8865210"," it's not calculating Uh, a quick rip down."
"8865430","8870410"," So let's say just in the overnight we slammed down in here and we opened here And then and then"
"8870410","8872310"," and then it worked like right here, right?"
"8873010","8878890"," so Yeah, like smoothing out what is what it's predicting once you're past here. "
"8879070","8882430"," It's gonna then And then it's gonna look like hey, it did work out, right?"
"8883610","8890670"," If it if we like slammed down here in the overnight and Then we just went sideways friday and then"
"8890670","8897290"," slammed up on On wednesday Sure, like three days later it did work, right?"
"8897610","8898030"," Does it make sense?"
"8898150","8906270"," It would smooth itself out over time um And You might not interpret that or you might be here"
"8906990","8912590"," Reading the algo today buy some calls and then we come down here and you're like, oh shit I got"
"8912590","8918430"," to sell my ad algo sucks I'm selling and then it just goes sideways and up again and then the"
"8918430","8922150"," algo actually worked then you come back and you're like well You don't fuck you cap You fucking"
"8922150","8926010"," told me that shit worked and then it didn't and then it did Or you just disappear and tell me"

"8951370","8957410"," It's smooth itself out over a day or two And if it goes down below this certain number, it's going"
"8957410","8963310"," to recalculate and tell you to go fuck yourself like all those kind of things And how do we how"
"8963310","8964990"," do we how do we present that information?"
"8967270","8968050"," Does it make sense?"

"9105300","9106640"," Where would a short come back here?"
"9107120","9110420"," Where would a short come back in here to lean on the market again?"
"9110900","9116700"," So if you were a short right You know you've taken your money from up here Taking your money from"
"9116700","9120140"," from here at least or here you kind of diamond handed your shit, right?"
"9120680","9127380"," You got paid right here This is your target right So where would you re-enter that short?"
"9127700","9134240"," Well, you know that there's some shorts now sitting here They do not want Shorts do not want us to"
"9134240","9135240"," get above this pivot line. "
"9135240","9140360"," They want to keep us negative Right, you've got this other area of interest right here That's a"

"9168480","9171560"," This is a dangerous trade to take a put in does that not mean that we don't sell that?"
"9171680","9178420"," I know it just means it's a dangerous trade um This is a less dangerous trade you can you can"
"9178420","9186040"," scale into a short position or a put position here here and here Um, but we are intraday next few"
"9186040","9193080"," days until we break above this pivot point again We're bearish right now if you want it to be like,"
"9193080","9201980"," oh, I'm very like I'm a conservative bear A position to take like care care about my positioning"
"9202480","9205040"," Then you would wait to reshort right here."
"9205360","9210380"," You'd be shorting with these people back here Right makes sense now these people sometimes come"
"9210380","9214660"," down and in short a lower lower place If you're like, I'm gonna put a little bit more risk on"
"9214660","9219600"," their cap as a bear This would be the place for you want to be shorting off s1 If you're"
"9219600","9224020"," like super if you've already been if you if you got it in the short here And you're like I"
"9224020","9228980"," took off a bunch of profit And I wanted to leave a little bit on for this the rest of"
"9228980","9230100"," this move down at the end of the day."
"9230280","9234800"," You can do that too You know you have to you have to look at this from the perspective of"
"9235560","9241560"," When someone got in the trade and how much risk they're putting on and how much they leave on maybe"
"9241560","9245640"," for more down the road And when you're trying to enter the trade if you're trying to enter the"
"9245640","9248240"," trade down here for the first time It's a risky trade. "
"9248480","9255960"," It doesn't mean that doesn't print it means It's risky It's not the best trade if you missed this"
"9255960","9256280"," trade."
"9256440","9259480"," So we shorted or we took puts what last Thursday?"
"9259820","9267700"," I think a wednesday into thursday Friday said to you I want to see this go down on monday tuesday"
"9267700","9272780"," So you should have taken some put spreads or puts here that those two times, right?"
"9274260","9277120"," Uh, so what are you looking for for the next one?"
"9277780","9278480"," I don't know."
"9278680","9284640"," It's usually you'll see once you'll see once profits taken a spring higher, right?"
"9285100","9294890"," So you'd be looking for um if you're getting bearish here You know you're looking for You"
"9294890","9301870"," can see where they step in right Come down nailed it right come down nailed it right you're gonna"
"9301870","9307590"," expect them to come back in over here Right and try to nail this in right?"
"9308030","9311510"," Did it once did it twice want to get this down in here tomorrow?"
"9311990","9313970"," Uh, so where do you take that short?"
"9314490","9321410"," It's somewhere in here right somewhere At this s this is s1 level You want to start attacking this"
"9321410","9325930"," again up in here Um, if you if you're like, oh, I took some puts here and they didn't print"
"9325930","9331670"," you'd have then you're gonna add to your position up here Try to get this move down into uh tuesday"
"9331670","9332250"," or wednesday. "
"9332410","9333110"," Does that make sense yet?"
"9333410","9338450"," You want to be back up here in the in the tops of these trades Uh, or leave some runners"
"9338450","9341250"," on maybe you get this before the end of day today."
"9341530","9343350"," Maybe it is Entity today."
"9343770","9349030"," I don't I can't predict that kind of stuff for you Uh, but when you ask about when we're already"
"9349030","9353190"," down this far This is like asking me should I put some puts on here cap and i'm like fuck"
"9353190","9355630"," no close them Right puts them on here. "
"9355750","9356570"," Fuck no close them."
"9356650","9360730"," Take the money and run right take the money and run take the money and run My assumption is"
"9360730","9363270"," sometimes you'll get that last little third bleed out down there."
"9363390","9369290"," This is a good meat One two and then three slam it home if it happens, maybe you get some"
"9369290","9371290"," puts here for tomorrow, right?"
"9371950","9378970"," Uh for the open for the open for tomorrow for that last push down that last bloodbath um But there"
"9378970","9381570"," might be this opportunity in here to grab at a better better price. "
"9382030","9389510"," So You know, I don't want to say to hear when it comes to You know, it's weird whenever whenever"
"9389510","9393390"," we're right here No one ever wants to buy puts whenever we're right here."
"9393470","9398470"," No one ever wants to buy puts Um, so and you know to see this green bar right there like"
"9398470","9404550"," this will fuck you up, right Or make you fearful if you had a green bar straight here That would"
"9404550","9409170"," scare you'd be like i'm closing my puts and then all of a sudden it blasts down tomorrow morning."
"9409910","9410670"," Does that make sense?"
"9413450","9417190"," Whenever we're here, I'll tell you exactly what happens Whenever we're here. "
"9417470","9421190"," I get told cap you should take calls man Whenever we're here."
"9421570","9426210"," I get told you should take puts captain whenever you know what I mean Whenever i'm here take calls"
"9426210","9429210"," captain down here being asked the same question."
"9429290","9436670"," So It's not like it's it's not like it doesn't prove itself once It's that the other four or five"
"9436670","9438110"," times it didn't prove itself. "
"9438430","9444490"," So you might hit that one jackpot and be like fuck Yeah, we did it made money fucking stoked Uh,"
"9444610","9450050"," but the reality is you didn't right the reality is that if you go back to like 10 trades 20"
"9450050","9454650"," trades 30 trades You blew up your account here like this is the place for you."
"9455150","9460190"," This is one of those places where you blew up your accounts It's not the high probability trade"
"9465110","9471710"," Usually it's against what your brain is thinking usually it's like not always but sometimes"
"9471710","9479610"," sometimes it is what your brain is thinking but like even my brain my brain my normal brain right"
"9479610","9490590"," now is like my normal like human brain It tells me fucking"
"9491590","9493450"," Balls deep and puts right here captain."
"9493690","9505190"," That's what that's telling me That's why brains telling me My"
"9505190","9513490"," brain's like fucking load up one puts Get super duper bearish Your brain's like if this rejects one"
"9513490","9518290"," more time this actually this is logical if you if you start seeing this bullshit for too long We"
"9518290","9523910"," will bleed off into the bell How far is it here That's what that red line is on book map,"
"9524090","9524170"," right?"
"9524590","9525190"," You see it, right?"
"9534260","9535680"," So right here in book map, right?"
"9536360","9539440"," Uh, we haven't staircase we haven't stair stepped down. "
"9539600","9543160"," We haven't been led down The order book hasn't changed down there."
"9543860","9546140"," So let's say we do let's say we do get down there, right?"
"9546900","9550640"," So you're gonna you're gonna see something like this right you're gonna see come down here, right?"
"9550780","9555660"," We go down here We hit it right you're like whoa about some puts."
"9556140","9556360"," Thankfully. "
"9556540","9559620"," I didn't listen to cap And we hit that red line."
"9559940","9562560"," This is that big red line that's on book map, right?"
"9563500","9571600"," But then it does this To hit that line that fucking they didn't pull that order book fucking slams"
"9571600","9579700"," 600 fucking Bies on fucking des and so you see you got trapped in here, right that move So, I"
"9579700","9582620"," don't know I'm trying to look at all the probabilities here."
"9582860","9583620"," What can happen?"
"9584200","9591140"," All I know is This is probably not the place to buy puts If anything, this is the place to"
"9591140","9599580"," look for A reaction off a re sorry If anything, this is this is the place to be looking for"
"9600280","9606380"," If it was a trade here like a high probability a high probability trade Uh, I know exactly what it"
"9606380","9613060"," is The high or the the highest prop the hoping like the trade that I hope for Is that we"
"9613060","9622830"," sell down To where that's where that demand is Right and then we"

"11518910","11523710"," Right, you gotta get I'm saying probability of loss of the sample group is greater So when you so"
"11523710","11528530"," let's bring that to its logical conclusion just some guy So what would you do then if you had a"
"11528530","11532390"," probability of making more profit off of one group than the other, right?"
"11533190","11538630"," Um, you would only need to hold their order flow back so much now this other group we have a"

"11545330","11551810"," You don't maybe hold it longer or sell it faster um So that you could start to maximize each group"
"11557850","11563770"," Which is kind of crazy and fucked up that's I think that's part of the I think that's part of"
"11563770","11572950"," the problem with or paying for it to flow is that you could possibly identify um Groups and decide"

"11579730","11582170"," assuming that there's some um in the background."

"11605330","11606190"," Let's have a look see. "
"11606310","11616050"," We could be forming a double bottom here Uh There's some problems"
"11616050","11616490"," here."
"11617030","11621990"," So this little thing this bullshit down here I'm forming up back here."
"11622530","11629250"," This can lead to stepping down Uh, although there is hasn't been a rug pull yet if you see here"
"11629250","11633250"," you still have a standing order of seven This is a pretty big fucking wall right here. "
"11633410","11635390"," I'm assuming that this is deltunoteral."
"11635530","11644430"," I know that um I know that um Spock am I put out a uh This is where zero gam"
"11644430","11648610"," is today or something, but I'm assuming it change well not assuming I know for a fucking fact it"
"11648610","11653230"," changes all day long And I know that the data is better at certain times of the day than it"
"11653230","11657070"," is at other times of the day I also know that they have to get Shit out to you before"
"11657070","11658030"," the open in the morning."
"11658030","11665030"," So that data is not exact either um So You know, there's this little point here. "
"11665290","11669610"," So there's two things that we're concerned about That's uh, this showing up on a knower."
"11669750","11674250"," You see it wasn't here before these are usually this is kind of what you call a stinkbin Right so"
"11674250","11679670"," you you put these bids in lower and it it teases down the bid right saying saying we can come"
"11679670","11684410"," down lower even though there's 700 and then what you do is uh, you rug pull over this you rip"
"11684410","11691090"," your standing orders out And you get a quick slam down boom Right so you would see that expressed"
"11692270","11699890"," You would see that expressed on a chart Uh where you'd see a grind right here just grinding a"
"11699890","11709630"," little bit missing and changing color of this I'm damn You can see a little bit of a grind in"
"11709630","11710030"," here, right?"
"11710210","11712230"," And then a quick down right?"
"11712390","11718390"," I got the I got the money that I wanted to get um And then we rock chip back up"
"11718390","11724630"," again now another problem here is this is that um We start grinding through these these uh buyers"
"11724630","11725350"," here, right?"
"11725570","11730190"," We get no reaction notice how we're just sold the top of the key came back down just grinding now"
"11730190","11733890"," Uh, and we could start stepping down into the clothes."
"11734350","11737690"," So there's some real concern here You want to see a reaction here. "
"11737790","11739050"," We're not so we got a reaction here."
"11739130","11744790"," We're not getting a reaction right here Um, so what I would say to you would be Either if you're"

"13205580","13217130"," being broken You can see that we broke it once before right And you saw what happened right Now"
"13217130","13226430"," you broke it again and There's nothing to say we can't There's nothing there's literally nothing"
"13226430","13231950"," saying we can't come right back in a trend higher again Uh, but you know as a bull you want"
"13231950","13236870"," it back here You didn't want to be buying this back here for the the Santa rally If you're going"

"13250450","13251430"," I want you guys to see this."
"13251510","13261410"," Okay There's a lot of consolidation down in here, okay Lot a lot see"
"13261410","13270100"," all this in here There's nothing to say that we don't we don't go higher even mike wilson mike"
"13270100","13277520"," wilson's telling you the tops four one five zero This this meets what mike wilson's saying He's"
"13277520","13282320"," like we're selling stocks sure is mike wilson going to just start doing this kind of stuff here"
"13282320","13286540"," Maybe but the reality is they're going to want to get the best price possible It would not surprise"
"13286540","13287640"," me to see us go up from here. "
"13287760","13288120"," Does it make sense?"
"13288740","13291640"," Uh, so where's the best place to buy this probably down below here, right?"
"13292840","13302980"," Best place In air people tell you that we've broken um We're now in negative gamma I"
"13302980","13309380"," think they're going to say that because we're below the 200 SMA Uh We've broken into negative gamma"
"13310040","13318480"," so you're going to expect uh Markets to be more uh volatile, right Now so you're going to expect"
"13318480","13322920"," more volatility now They're going to tell you that bears are going to want to hold this level here"
"13323900","13331080"," Bears bears want to defend this level for the next leg down So you want to consider that right any"
"13331080","13336120"," rips that come into the market down here even if it's down here You want them to be short-lived"
"13336120","13345620"," that makes sense So you probably hear hey, you could buy calls on the bell here for for a For"
"13345620","13351480"," a turnaround tuesday trade or it's going to be at the open tomorrow for a turnaround tuesday trade"
"13351960","13358080"," So this prompt is likely a turnaround tuesday trade tomorrow Close the gap or some of it probably"
"13358080","13368580"," to the 200 or some Fail at the 200 makes sense and then start the the next roll down For"
"13368580","13376280"," this next trade down this that this trade down probably hasn't begun yet in full earnest now If we"
"13376280","13379380"," bleed off into the open tomorrow, this is a 100 buy."
"13379700","13384780"," I want you to know that If you're a bull out there, even if you're bearish or if you're a"
"13384780","13389880"," bear, I can promise to you 100 Right that this gets bought if there's like some overnight"
"13389880","13397300"," shenanigans Some low low low trading and low liquidity trading environment And then and we trade"
"13397300","13406720"," down over the overnight I can assure you Can assure you myself included I will fucking buy that"
"13406720","13412040"," fucking bell With a shit ton of money with you So if you get this kind of a move down,"
"13412160","13418880"," this is the safest trade is a bull Is that you wait for the open tomorrow You'll find people on"
"13418880","13424760"," fin twit certainly They're going to say gap up tomorrow and there is a chance of a gap up overnight"
"13425520","13426520"," I'm not gonna lie to you."
"13426620","13432320"," There's a chance of a sell off and a gap up by open Uh, so maybe you might see some"
"13432320","13436100"," blood in the middle of the night and then a rip before you can catch it Uh, but the safest"
"13436100","13438300"," trade is down here safest trade is an open bell. "
"13438460","13442960"," You take this trade It's going to kick ass if we sell off into into the amids to kick ass"
"13442960","13452840"," trade Now with that all being said if this channel is not not caught Uh, you would buy this and"
"13452840","13458160"," look to sell it before we get to the Top of the key here or the s sma 200 again"
"13458160","13461440"," This would be the place for bears to step back in if we saw off in the overnight."
"13461520","13462320"," Does that make sense?"
"13463260","13466700"," Uh, so if you're asking me what's the what's the trade into the bell?"
"13467780","13477320"," uh It would be Some cheap calls And be willing to burn them and buy the open tomorrow So you'd"
"13477320","13482180"," have to be like yeah, I'm gonna Come buy some dirt cheap calls One or two or three strikes outside"
"13482180","13487240"," the money And then if they burn you'd retake that trade again in the open tomorrow."
"13487300","13497020"," That's a fairly good trading plan Into tomorrow the bears For the bears Uh, you have the potential"
"13497020","13502200"," for a bleed off into the overnight down here Uh, you could throw some shit tickets out there and"
"13502200","13508740"," see if they see if they print Uh, but you're basically looking for bears are looking to defend uh"
"13508740","13516980"," 400 for 200 sma bears want to defend this area right here Because when the bears are trying to"
"13516980","13523340"," defend at this point Uh, and you you want to really be taking a Taking a, uh, you know some"
"13523340","13530160"," some shorts above to nail this level right here And then uh, if we break down below here and it"
"13530160","13536560"," holds like you break through Like one or two taps Uh, you really want to get on some put spreads"
"13536560","13545220"," that are into Like january or mart or just so you can pick your risk December january march Uh for"
"13545220","13551060"," retesting lows down here I don't know how fast this happens, but if this hat does happen fast there"
"13551060","13556260"," could be a quick rip up But uh, if we start breaking down below here, uh, you're gonna have a"
"13556260","13560240"," high high chance high likelihood Uh that we trade down below. "
"13560560","13562080"," My view right now is still bullish."
"13562280","13568240"," I'm still bullish here I haven't changed my my view point at all Uh, this this is all this is"
"13568240","13576310"," more bleed off than I want it today Uh, but i'm still i'm still comfortable a lot I'm still"
"13576310","13576710"," comfortable."
"13576950","13582610"," I'm still open to the long trade higher Um The for me to get bearish. "
"13582910","13591230"," I need this I need this broken baby This is like the key If you're like zul and you want"
"13591230","13597310"," the depths of hell This right no matter what mike wilson says or anyone else out there says This is"
"13597310","13602850"," why i put my blinders on with public Because I know and you should know that this is the key"
"13602850","13610210"," over here This is the you break this down here and you start breaking down Ooh, that's the meat of"
"13610210","13615190"," the bear trade That's the juice down there this shit in here is dangerous."
"13615510","13616510"," You don't time this shit."
"13616630","13618390"," This is like You don't time this shit, right?"
"13618570","13623770"," You get fucked up in these trades over here This is like high conviction shit You know, let me"
"13623770","13625130"," explain this in the inverse to you. "
"13625150","13630150"," Okay I'm gonna explain the inverse of this to you so that you you can tell what the inverse is"
"13631090","13637990"," Right down here See all this mess in here This is the same."
"13638270","13645440"," This is just the inverse right here So, you know if you bought down here you would go up here"
"13645860","13651020"," Remember if you're bought like calls down here This would easily fit this was scared of the shit"
"13651020","13658880"," out of you People like oh shit What was I think in I totally made the wrong decision and then"
"13658880","13661240"," boom Does that make sense?"
"13661240","13668020"," So this is all the inverse you can you can use something similar to this in the inverse Uh, and"
"13668020","13675520"," this right here is the we this is the mike wilson That we trade that we trade back up and"
"13675520","13678240"," hit that 4150 That's what he's saying."
"13678400","13685920"," He's saying is no no no no That he's got no qualms with or that he's got no Uh, he's"
"13685920","13687840"," he's even those biases down. "
"13688060","13695440"," He would not be shocked to see us ass blaster Like do this ass blaster up right here, right?"
"13695800","13700340"," So did you see you see when you guys like that say stuff like that, right?"
"13701300","13705100"," This would be just upside down of what happened down the other side, right?"
"13706280","13710240"," So you get this one little ass blaster if you're a barrier like oh shit everyone's telling me"
"13714030","13720210"," Everyone's telling me You know we're going down and i'm upside down and I got fucking phones"
"13720210","13725270"," ringing right now with my short Get in fucked right now When reality that's when you get that sell"
"13725270","13725850"," down now."
"13725890","13730390"," I'm assuming this is what mike mike saying something like this Does it make sense?"
"13732510","13735110"," That isn't this isn't saying what's going to happen."
"13735150","13741070"," I'm telling you that This is when you know la wave guys go Well, we're going to come back up"
"13741070","13745050"," here and then we're going to reject And then of course they get their racers out because we extend"
"13745050","13745610"," up here. "
"13745650","13751770"," So you know you guys don't get what i'm saying So trade each level Take each level for whatever it"
"13751770","13756530"," is This is when people break their racers out and go they tell you we're going here and then you"
"13756530","13761210"," go ah fuck we're not going there And then this none of this happens, right?"
"13761430","13762470"," We just start selling it down."
"13762550","13770630"," So trade each level Take each level down or take each level up make sense You'd take this level"
"13770630","13772470"," then from there up or this level back down."
"13772570","13779160"," This is a horrible drawing look at that Uh So that's my take for tomorrow. "
"13779260","13785060"," My take would be Uh, you could put some risk on the bell if you wanted to He'd be a"
"13785060","13785420"," buyer."
"13785740","13791200"," He'd be a buyer of this into the bell With cheap money Am I grind you in this bell?"
"13791320","13796060"," I'd be waiting in here somewhere Uh for for potential rip higher and close close all this nonsense"
"13796060","13801300"," tomorrow Uh, and then if it burns don't listen to anybody out there and social media just be like"
"13801300","13806380"," yeah, whatever, but it should burn I don't give a fine fuck And then first thing in the morning If"
"13806380","13812700"," it burns you go in there 930 and you slam that buy button again And I'm sure I'll assure you"
"13812700","13816940"," that that'll more than pay for whatever you lost today Does that help?"
"13819540","13823980"," For my take on to the into them the close today and tomorrow now take what I told you today"
