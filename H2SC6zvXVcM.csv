"66790","68150"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"70050","71250"," Good to see you all."
"71530","71930"," Happy New Year."
"78670","83420"," Good morning, good morning. "
"85200","86060"," Hey, what's going on?"
"86180","86500"," Stacey."
"87020","88140"," Boy, it said no."
"88620","90480"," We have, baby, what's going on. "
"91260","92560"," Happy New Year to all out there."
"96640","97780"," Welcome back, welcome back."
"100180","102380"," It's like a couple of things you gotta do. "
"103640","107880"," So not a whole heck of a lot happened last week, the first week of the year, right?"
"108760","110920"," Ruled down a little bit, consolidated a little bit."
"110920","114360"," It looks like there's a possible dip buy."
"121110","122690"," Let's see here. "
"125250","126430"," One quick second, guys."
"127090","127830"," Switch over here real quick."
"131710","132650"," There we go. "
"132910","133670"," Sing that."
"139900","142800"," Which is a good opportunity for us to discuss in more detail in the field."
"142800","144180"," I haven't shown a camera while I have. "
"144300","146080"," I've been promoting, running the stream."
"146080","148000"," Getting further into oncology."
"148000","148740"," It's not over. "
"149720","154360"," They do pay a huge premium for a turn to this off back here."
"154380","155240"," 28 bucks."
"155340","156760"," So over 100%. "
"156760","157500"," That's not a bad."
"157660","159220"," These guys are out of their fucking mind."
"159440","160620"," CNBC is out of their minds. "
"160900","165180"," Not only at San BC is out of their minds, but there's a lot of people out there out of"
"165180","166380"," their minds too right now."
"167260","171020"," I have a first of all, we post this really quick on."
"172740","177160"," Let's say the first day back, I'm like, everybody's out of their minds. "
"182480","183600"," That is like an air."
"186500","187740"," People are all fired up."
"187840","188680"," It's like the new year. "
"188920","190460"," Let's get it on all that kind of stuff."
"190560","192080"," But I'm more like, let's take it slow."
"192520","193560"," Let's see, he's into the new year. "
"194840","198120"," You know, it's like we got a brand new year coming up here."
"199080","203780"," Well, let's take our time and soak it all in for a minute."
"206060","206860"," And QQ's. "
"206940","207900"," What else we got going on?"
"208420","209740"," I guess we can take a look at Tesla today."
"209880","210680"," We'll just won't say it."
"212600","215260"," Hopefully Tesla Gang shows up at some point this morning. "
"216960","218920"," YouTube link is where, right there."
"219960","220760"," Is that the YouTube link?"
"220960","222120"," Yeah, there it is."
"223080","226560"," And we'll do the Twitch link and. "
"229400","231000"," Let's see, we got going on here."
"231100","231840"," We'll post that link."
"235620","237480"," Anybody get out skiing this weekend?"
"238880","240740"," I was able to get out. "
"242660","243820"," And it's weird."
"244000","246320"," I was going to put it off until this week, Tuesday, Wednesday."
"246620","247360"," We're getting a bunch of snow. "
"247980","249840"," And now it doesn't look like we're getting snow."
"249840","251880"," So I'm just grateful that I went."
"253240","253800"," Good morning. "
"253860","254680"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"255540","256420"," Good to see you all."
"257860","262800"," So there's a bunch of stuff we have to go over as usual, plus it being the new year and"
"262800","263080"," stuff."
"264620","268000"," We got all kinds of crap to go over for Q1. "
"269020","273220"," I've got an expectation for the year coming out."
"274020","277920"," I wrote it a couple of weeks ago, working on it."
"278680","284600"," And when you release stuff like this, I like to take a breather and look back on it a few"
"284600","285140"," days later. "
"285400","287720"," That kind of stuff and just make sure that it's where it needs to be."
"287860","288300"," It's almost there."
"288420","290060"," It should be released today, believe it or not. "
"290840","295640"," So if you're in the stream or whatever, we're going to take a quick look before we get into the"
"295640","296100"," open here."
"296500","297760"," I know it's open right now."
"297820","301480"," We're going to take a quick peek at something here. "
"302360","305900"," I want to show you guys something really quick here."
"306000","308700"," It has a daily chart on Spy."
"309740","317000"," And what I want to draw your attention to here is somewhere up in this R3 up here. "
"317100","319180"," We've got some range expansion just so you can notice."
"320020","324300"," I'm going to post about it real quickly this morning on Fintuit."
"324880","328100"," And there's a real concern for myself here. "
"328960","330060"," It's a multifold concern."
"330060","336800"," So I do expect us to go up if you're wondering on the opening this morning, you can actually see"
"336800","337920"," I think we're going up, right?"
"338100","345400"," But then when we come back down over here, which I expect as well, if you're a bull, you are"
"345400","347740"," looking for some kind of a bounce down here."
"348120","350940"," And this 462 is the key level. "
"352100","354080"," I've got a CTA tracker."
"355220","357880"," This is the smart money tracker, right?"
"357880","363640"," And they are net sellers below this area."
"364160","366300"," They're going to become net sellers down here. "
"367060","372980"," So I want you to be aware that whatever role there is above, and we have one more role coming,"
"373500","379580"," this has to hold for us to go back up and try to take out all-time highs on SPX."
"379900","387820"," If we fail and we start to break down below this 462, keep 462 on your radar."
"388960","393340"," Specifically, I believe it's 462.30 on SPX. "
"394060","398140"," I will check that again, but I'll just look right now and check."
"398660","400260"," I'll give you an exact number."
"401620","407820"," Right, snap a line on your charts at home on TradingView with an alert to your phone and to your"
"407820","408240"," Gmail. "
"408240","416140"," And what you're going to do is you want to make sure that this level holds, okay?"
"416780","421620"," If it does not hold, CTA's will become net sellers."
"422380","424140"," So I'm going to give you this number right now."
"424440","428420"," It is 462.5 on SPX. "
"428680","431500"," So 4625 on SPX."
"432060","435440"," This is spy right here, but it's basically we come down here at any point."
"435440","438460"," We begin to break down here. "
"440140","441160"," CTA's become sellers."
"441660","446740"," And what will happen is things are going to get saucy and pretty nasty."
"447080","456220"," We will correct at least to the next week or two, let's say we could correct 450 easily. "
"456720","459500"," And then we've got some gaps and stuff to close down here."
"459640","460440"," Things could get ugly."
"460440","462900"," Now, not like bear town ugly. "
"463120","465660"," You know that kind of stuff that you're being fed out there."
"466660","471500"," Actually below 4853 is where the market becomes negative."
"472180","473820"," Just keep your eye on that as well. "
"474420","476140"," So you might hear a bunch of doom and gloom, right?"
"476440","476980"," Crash coming."
"478220","481300"," The expectation there would be that we would hit 450."
"482720","488700"," Now even if we broke down below there and went even lower, you're still at 4853. "
"488700","491600"," And as long as we stay above that, we are bullish."
"493060","496500"," The price above the monthly is key."
"497160","499360"," You can actually see this correction that we had back here. "
"500740","505300"," And you can see it bounced, of course, on that monthly we stayed positive."
"506120","509680"," So even if we go down here, it's just another great place to buy a dip."
"510380","519179"," Now, for where we are right now, these, for where we are right now and for volatility's sake, we've"
"519179","521020"," got this bounce here off the daily trigger. "
"521840","526500"," And I get scared around the daily trigger these days because every time we come down here and mess"
"526500","533260"," with this daily trigger, we tend to have a lot of consolidation down in here."
"534080","536000"," And sometimes even break down below it, right?"
"536140","537260"," Right here, blast down below."
"537420","539180"," Come back up, blast down below it. "
"540000","543100"," So you can actually see that's been going on the past couple of days, right?"
"543600","548560"," Last week, we've got a little bit of bouncing around right over the chop going on."
"549200","552200"," So we'll go back to this 30 minute trigger here and take a peek at it over here."
"552700","555560"," And let's take a look at what velocity is at least saying here. "
"558850","560590"," Let's take a look at velocity really quick."
"560830","563950"," And you can see we were on the negative hourly velocity down here."
"564110","564190"," Whoo. "
"565130","565430"," Right."
"566210","569710"," A little of the bottom action, the daily velocity down here is still staying alive."
"569710","575010"," That we can always come back up here in daily fellow, come back up here in hourly fellow, and come"
"575010","579490"," back down in price and still had lower on that daily velocity. "
"580030","585190"," So for right now, all I'm expecting on this, if you just check this, let me show you this better"
"585190","590590"," way to show you this daily velocity would be where we come up, right?"
"592330","593050"," Second here."
"594830","597890"," Come back up right up here one more, one more high."
"597890","599870"," And then we come back down and head to the downside. "
"600370","604710"," So my expectations here are limited to the upside."
"605470","612250"," You've got about a 472ish somewhere in there, 472 as an expected target and then some kind of a"
"612250","612510"," roll."
"613330","615950"," So I would be really wary up here of some kind of a roll. "
"616250","619110"," And then you get your attack to the downside of that 462."
"619730","622130"," If that does hold, we can get back up here."
"622210","624990"," Jump above the daily trigger somewhere like that. "
"624990","631830"," I am then looking for the full on attack of the all time highs on SPX."
"632430","642010"," Now, if we were able to get that attack in that 460, excuse me, the 480 on SPX and spoos,"
"642170","646790"," get the new high on spoos and get the new high on SPX, that would be the end of the"
"646790","652810"," run for me until expecting a pretty big low in March."
"652810","659890"," So whatever this move to the upside is right here, however that snaps in and hits that all time"
"659890","661130"," high, it's just above this. "
"661970","670130"," So somewhere around this 480, whether we fail it or get it into March, I'm expecting a pretty big"
"670130","671050"," downside move."
"671350","677130"," So as long as this holds right now, as long as the daily trigger holds, as long as we stay"
"677130","680630"," above the hourly trigger, which looks like we are right now at the opening bell."
"681690","684210"," I have that expectation of an upside move. "
"684630","685930"," So if you're a seller, right?"
"686070","692350"," If you're a bear out there, if you want, if you're a sell side, I know for a fact, I"
"692350","699390"," know for a fucking fact that you guys drank the goddamn Kool-Aid on Friday about doom and gloom."
"700590","702030"," And I know you did."
"702210","707930"," And I bet you sat on fucking bent to it all weekend, fucking pushing that garbage. "
"707930","713390"," So if you're a seller, if you're a fucking seller, right?"
"713970","715470"," Yeah, yeah, you'll be right."
"716070","718470"," You're just not, you just didn't time it right."
"718750","720450"," My view, at least you didn't time it right. "
"720630","723290"," So I'd be looking more up here to be a seller."
"723390","729510"," So if you're on the sell side of things, be looking for this 472, 474, some kind of nonsense like"
"729510","729770"," that."
"730270","735190"," And then we'll start talking about you beating business to the downside and how far that downside"
"735190","735590"," is. "
"735590","737490"," I'm going to warn you guys of something, okay?"
"737850","741550"," I'm going to warn you guys of something really, really important here, okay?"
"742390","744270"," I got to warn you guys of something."
"744670","747450"," There are a lot of voices out there."
"747630","755350"," I'm reading voices and I'm seeing, I'm seeing like the, it's like fucking finger painting baby food"
"755350","756090"," or some shit. "
"757070","761570"," And it's just pure diarrhea, like pure diarrhea."
"761570","765450"," I see people out there saying that fucking rate cuts are good."
"765770","771750"," I see people saying that rate cuts are, that rate cuts are good, that they'll be good for the"
"771750","772110"," marketplace. "
"772530","777910"," You got bond market trying to push the issue that we're getting rate cuts."
"778110","780730"," There's nothing saying that we're getting rate cuts out there."
"782990","789530"," So I want you to know that a lot of these people out there that are spinning webs for you"
"789530","793650"," are out of their fucking minds straight up. "
"793950","799650"," You got the, the feds told you, told me, and you guys know that I wanted that rate cut or"
"799650","800830"," I welcome that rate cut."
"801210","806670"," And I do, I welcome it because I, even if we squeeze up, I'm expecting the market to roll down"
"806670","807910"," in a heavy and hard way."
"808330","814370"," And whether that's now or if it's at the end of next year, the key point here is that, the"
"814370","816930"," key point here is that the Fed has told us no. "
"817350","821350"," The Fed has told us to fuck ourselves, right?"
"821710","826750"," And so if that's the case, we're going to run this, we're going to run that expectation for this"
"826750","826950"," year."
"827410","829230"," We're going to run this shit up at the end of the year."
"829310","832730"," We're going to find a nice fucking fat dipped by in March, right?"
"832970","835110"," I think, I think, I've, I got something cool for you guys. "
"835270","835850"," Hold on one second."
"835950","837250"," I got, I got something cool."
"837390","838030"," Hold on a second here. "
"838110","838710"," I got something really cool."
"868090","869010"," All right, I'm back."
"869230","870110"," Hold on one second here. "
"870190","871090"," I was working on this yesterday."
"871090","872230"," You guys even like this."
"872230","877060"," There's a really, I got rid of that one right there. "
"880600","882580"," We are green, by the way."
"883080","890000"," We are above, we are above the gamma flip at this moment right now."
"890600","896020"," So that whole gamma flip thesis that some of y'all got out there have been feeding to rip all"
"896020","897940"," that shit up that you read on Friday. "
"900600","902060"," Rip all that shit up."
"902940","904780"," Just tear that shit to pieces."
"905180","906220"," I know you read it on Friday. "
"909960","911940"," We're now in positive gamma again."
"912180","912700"," Oh shit."
"918960","919440"," Okay. "
"919560","921480"," We're going to look at SPX down here."
"922440","925520"," You got a narrowly trigger to your upside here in SPX."
"925700","926340"," I want to take a look at that. "
"926460","930480"," It's at four, seven, one, five, zero, seven."
"930480","934360"," So if you're looking for a place for a pullback, it's likely right there."
"936460","939420"," Now, four, seven, one, five, point zero, seven. "
"939560","941860"," That's this SPX down here."
"942000","945340"," So if you're looking for a place where they're going to try to sell you, it's right in here."
"945580","946420"," Right down there. "
"949570","951110"," But you guys going to be careful out there."
"951290","954890"," The things that I'm reading and watching and watching shit."
"955070","955790"," I'm reading stuff. "
"956050","961770"," I did my homework while I was away and people out of their fucking minds, dude, they are out of"
"961770","963250"," their fucking minds."
"963970","965850"," I don't know if it's every year in January."
"966230","966830"," We come to this. "
"966910","967910"," I don't know why people sit."
"968210","970710"," Like I'm watching CNBC right now, right?"
"971190","972990"," And they're talking about and CNBC."
"973010","978830"," They're talking about like Apple sold off because of the DOJ investigation. "
"979190","980950"," That's a bunch of bullshit too."
"982270","987550"," Like the things that I read and watch out there just blow my fucking mind that I have nothing to"
"987550","992150"," do with the price of a price of fucking Apple and Denmark, I guess."
"992710","994090"," Anyways, I got some cool for you guys. "
"994450","996410"," I got my calendar in right here."
"997090","998930"," This is my hot guys calendar."
"999370","1000630"," Check this bad boy out. "
"1001470","1004510"," This is my hot, hot guys calendar."
"1005390","1006190"," You guys like that?"
"1006490","1007330"," Them apples right there."
"1007610","1008630"," You guys are going to zoom in. "
"1009210","1010670"," You guys are going to zoom in for you."
"1010950","1011290"," Hold on a second."
"1011370","1012170"," I'll zoom in for you here. "
"1012290","1013330"," Check this bad boy out."
"1014570","1015350"," Welcome back."
"1015350","1018210"," Oh, oh, yeah. "
"1019350","1021330"," We got hot guys."
"1022590","1026369"," Twenty twenty four calendar for all you sexies out there."
"1027230","1028750"," But what did I put on this calendar?"
"1029190","1029210"," Right?"
"1029369","1029770"," Might be wondering. "
"1031150","1032190"," I didn't."
"1032349","1034569"," Well, I think my daughter messed with it for a little bit."
"1034670","1037170"," Oh, Mr. January. "
"1037630","1038890"," Check that bad boy out."
"1040089","1040710"," I guess what I did."
"1041470","1043310"," I wrote down in this calendar. "
"1043829","1046290"," If you can see it or something, what did I write down?"
"1046910","1050010"," I wrote down the trading days of the year."
"1050090","1050610"," Pretty simple."
"1051250","1052210"," Just use the marker. "
"1053390","1055310"," And maybe you should order one of these."
"1055450","1058450"," I think these are five bucks on Amazon delivered or something like that."
"1059430","1063850"," And I wrote down the trading days of the year so that we can look for. "
"1064310","1067770"," If I call out something to you guys and I'm like, Hey, on the thirty four."
"1068310","1069910"," The session of the year."
"1070690","1074530"," You ask me, when is the fifty six session of the year cap?"
"1074990","1076270"," I can break out my. "
"1076730","1077250"," My."
"1078410","1079510"," Guys calendar."
"1080030","1083690"," And just just reference those dates for you. "
"1083810","1084010"," So."
"1084550","1086050"," As we trade this year."
"1086810","1088270"," We're talking about something here. "
"1088330","1089930"," We trade this year specifically."
"1090050","1091830"," Get some New Year's resolutions."
"1093070","1095530"," You guys know that I how I trade. "
"1096530","1098530"," Is a trade over sold."
"1099070","1103570"," Bounces right over sold market are clearer than over bought markets."
"1104070","1105350"," You guys know that already. "
"1105410","1106050"," I hope right."
"1106270","1109090"," You guys already know that in your prior experiences."
"1109750","1112630"," When you're trying to sell the market when it's over bought. "
"1113110","1113970"," It's not easy."
"1115170","1116370"," It's not consistent."
"1117190","1118550"," You can be like, Hey, we're at that. "
"1118730","1120750"," But that over bought area there."
"1120870","1121610"," We should roll now."
"1121610","1121970"," Right. "
"1122190","1122970"," And then what do they do?"
"1123330","1124270"," You know what happens."
"1124270","1124850"," Right there."
"1125570","1127630"," The CTA or CTA is along. "
"1129490","1133290"," On super aggressive, super risky risk on sectors."
"1134070","1135550"," And then they start rotating."
"1135870","1135970"," Right. "
"1136810","1138470"," Sometimes the market actually rolls."
"1138850","1139770"," Sometimes it doesn't."
"1139890","1140030"," Right. "
"1140190","1140890"," They roll through it."
"1140990","1142350"," They roll into each."
"1142490","1143290"," Each sector. "
"1143590","1146770"," And we sometimes will just trade sideways and slowly down."
"1147370","1150110"," Then all of a sudden we're back into rotation again to risk on again."
"1150110","1150530"," Right. "
"1150530","1155770"," So you know from my or from my experience at least I have a difficult time."
"1156330","1158030"," Having a high win rate."
"1158550","1163890"," On those over a bought sell signals with let's say put spreads or something like that. "
"1163950","1165950"," So the majority of my money I make."
"1166630","1168250"," From over sold."
"1169390","1169890"," Bounces. "
"1170170","1170270"," Right."
"1170430","1172630"," You guys know who also makes their money that way too."
"1172750","1172890"," Right. "
"1173190","1174590"," Tell someone in the chat, tell me who else."
"1175830","1181350"," Knows because I usually go to CNBC and start watching CNBC for a day or two to see who comes"
"1181350","1182030"," out and says."
"1183030","1184410"," We're bearish on this market. "
"1184430","1186330"," It's a classic guys from New Mexico."
"1187250","1188650"," He'll say this market sucks."
"1188810","1190250"," It's going to burn to the depths of hell. "
"1190790","1192230"," He goes, but we bought the dip."
"1192890","1194170"," Does anybody remember who that is?"
"1194710","1195670"," See I can see you guys."
"1195730","1198270"," See if you guys can name who that person is. "
"1198630","1204570"," I'll leave that up for the rest."
"1204570","1205210"," Anyway."
"1208070","1210330"," So my point here is this is that. "
"1211110","1213390"," As a new year resolution, we've been talking about."
"1215090","1217270"," Or we've been talking for the past couple of years."
"1217470","1219950"," How do you make your money and then what else do you do to make money?"
"1220210","1220230"," Right. "
"1220650","1222350"," It's mostly buying the market."
"1222870","1226150"," Speck growth stocks with the underlying right."
"1226710","1233250"," And then buying over sold bounces with call spreads stuff like that. "
"1233250","1237770"," And then of course, you'd think that's all you would need in your life."
"1237910","1240810"," But for me at least, it's not all that I need my life."
"1240970","1244570"," I need to be around here with you guys hanging out five days a week. "
"1244630","1246510"," So we fucking day trade too, right?"
"1246810","1247350"," That's what we do."
"1247510","1252090"," We piss our time away in this market day trading day in day out."
"1252450","1260910"," So we're going to come back to that idea of an oversold bounce or oversold bounce dips to buy when"
"1260910","1261530"," to buy them. "
"1261530","1267550"," And then of course, when they get out of them and how much we expect out of those oversold bounces"
"1267550","1274070"," and try to get you guys on a cleaner track this year than last year."
"1275270","1278950"," Then just just the day trade and kind of stuff that a lot of you guys are into."
"1280130","1286010"," You know, I was talking to Joe Donut over the holiday and we were discussing. "
"1287830","1290170"," We were discussing trader logs."
"1290870","1295230"," So what happens is some of you guys may know that some of you guys may not, but."
"1296150","1303430"," I get a lot of requests via my DMS. I get probably got a hundred emails a day, something like"
"1303430","1303650"," that."
"1304190","1304510"," Twitter."
"1306010","1309370"," 10 20 a day, something like that on Twitter and then Gmail. "
"1310070","1312070"," So between like Gmail discord."
"1313470","1317650"," Twitter handles, I get a lot of contact from people and."
"1318270","1321870"," We have some teachers inside of our discord as well. "
"1321870","1329510"," And when we do trader logs with traders, right, investors, especially people that blow up their"
"1329510","1329930"," accounts."
"1330570","1336010"," I'm fascinated, oftentimes fascinated by their trading history."
"1336690","1338070"," They're full history, right?"
"1338070","1341470"," You try to get someone's full history and it's kind of mind blown. "
"1341810","1343810"," People come and say like I just day trade."
"1345030","1350650"," Or I'm just trading spreads or I'm just selling, I'm just buying and selling futures, that kind of"
"1350650","1350850"," stuff."
"1351650","1357170"," And it doesn't matter what it is, but what's consistent is it's never what I trade. "
"1358350","1358490"," Right?"
"1358870","1362730"," So if you look at, if you compare my trader log with your trader log, it's not the same."
"1363790","1366570"," And so think about that this year."
"1366690","1370130"," Think about that, that this year that you should be having your own trade plan. "
"1371310","1376570"," And you should have a high probability win rates for how you make your money."
"1377150","1381730"," And that's a key point here is how do you make your money in the stock market specifically?"
"1382530","1386050"," Not how you make your money in your 401k, not how you make your money in your job, that kind"
"1386050","1392710"," of stuff, but."
"1392710","1395690"," I'm not sure you're adjusting to that some kind of a plan for this year. "
"1396730","1403350"," Because oftentimes that's what I find in these DMs is we'll check a trader, trader log."
"1403590","1406530"," And it's, I mean, I'm serious, like I'm serious."
"1406850","1407850"," This is smart people too, right?"
"1408170","1409570"," Like day trading. "
"1411150","1418610"," I took, I took these five trades and I double tripled quadrupled down with all of my money kind of"
"1418610","1418850"," stuff."
"1418850","1425170"," Or watching CNBC or I'm on thin to it and these are why I'm making these decisions."
"1426330","1434410"," And so it's easier for us if you track what your trading habits are, it's easier for us if you"
"1434410","1435950"," start to keep a record of. "
"1436730","1439290"," Number one, the type of training that you're doing."
"1439810","1443230"," Number two, how much are you winning, right?"
"1443230","1450690"," Versus your losses versus taxes versus every 10 times you take that trade, right?"
"1451450","1456070"," The cost of that trade, the risk that you're exposing yourself to."
"1456890","1463750"," If you being in New Year, if you can track that stuff this year, it's easier to go back and"
"1463750","1466250"," look and say, Hey, what are we doing wrong here?"
"1466430","1467070"," What are we doing right?"
"1467370","1468330"," What are we doing wrong here?"
"1468330","1470350"," Why are we making these decisions?"
"1470730","1472670"," What's putting us into these decision making?"
"1474030","1478230"," So we can try to correct and make someone profitable if possible. "
"1478750","1483790"," A lot of people that lose, man, are that I see, right?"
"1483950","1490510"," The law ones that I talk to are either extremely bearish or they're just day trading."
"1491190","1492930"," It doesn't matter what they're day trading."
"1493270","1496010"," It doesn't matter if they're day trading futures. "
"1496810","1500710"," Glowbacks doesn't matter if they're day trading, cash market."
"1501610","1507190"," That's what I often see is they're not they're not spreading that risk around a little bit on the"
"1507190","1507690"," back end."
"1508730","1510750"," And they're not taking all the same trades either. "
"1511170","1518250"," The people that are taking these trades, like you're seeing stuff like buying calls right here."
"1518250","1520910"," I show you not buying puts down here."
"1520930","1521610"," I show you not. "
"1521630","1522550"," It's like a kid you not."
"1523130","1527370"," They watch it go and they're like, yeah, I'm bullish here, right?"
"1528030","1531890"," I'm buying these dips down below here where they're scared down here, right?"
"1532050","1533130"," Same thing with sellers too."
"1533330","1538310"," You see the same thing with sellers start blasting down and they're buying puts down here, right?"
"1538650","1540350"," The other thing that's doing is only day trading. "
"1540690","1543930"," That's another thing that's kind of head scratcher to me."
"1545110","1547690"," Things Joe and I are talking about is how do you make your money?"
"1548530","1555590"," And how do you make your money is probably anywhere from six to ten trades a year."
"1555790","1559130"," Somewhere in there is where you should be making your money. "
"1560590","1562730"," I don't care if you're buying stock."
"1563050","1564370"," I don't care if you're selling stock."
"1564690","1565950"," I don't care if you're selling the market. "
"1565950","1574250"," It should be like, we should make somewhere around six to ten solid trades a year that you know are"
"1574250","1575050"," going to print."
"1575450","1577050"," Everybody's in agreement out there, right?"
"1577230","1578530"," Your bulls are in agreement with the bears."
"1578790","1579910"," The bears in agreement with the bulls. "
"1581370","1584230"," Everyone's in some kind of a consensus over those kind of trades."
"1588660","1590020"," Hey Steve, how's it going man?"
"1590140","1590340"," Good morning."
"1593540","1599800"," Yeah, that's a big part here, bull for trade and say in charge to determine the news, not the other"
"1599800","1600260"," way around. "
"1600660","1608460"," A lot of you guys got to get away from a lot of you guys could probably be a better"
"1608460","1609680"," investor or trader."
"1610820","1617460"," If you turned most of the fucking news off, you need to have the raw data news."
"1617460","1622500"," You need to know the economic calendar is big for you as an investor and trader. "
"1623580","1626520"," Unknown events to the market, of course, are big for you."
"1626720","1631620"," But a lot of you people need to plug the unfucking plug from a lot of what you hear out"
"1631620","1631860"," there."
"1632500","1635580"," And especially the drum beat that goes out there. "
"1635900","1642420"," There's a huge soap opera involved with the stock market and people have to sell what they're"
"1642420","1643180"," selling, right?"
"1643180","1644680"," People want to sell their own, right?"
"1645020","1648120"," People want to sell what they own, right?"
"1649020","1650940"," What they have under management, right?"
"1651100","1652200"," Money that they have under management."
"1652600","1654300"," People want to sell being a reporter."
"1655260","1657980"," People want to sell being a financial advisor. "
"1658300","1661500"," People want to sell being a, what do you call it?"
"1661660","1662800"," A furu, right?"
"1663100","1663820"," Doesn't really matter."
"1664500","1665580"," Selling a class, right?"
"1665920","1667580"," Whatever it is that someone's trying to sell."
"1667840","1676500"," There's usually a motivation about why they create this story for you to consume, right?"
"1676840","1680140"," Doesn't matter if it's right, wrong, or whatever, there's usually a story. "
"1680380","1681780"," But you have real money."
"1682560","1689900"," You know, you have your real hard earned money that is different than what people are trying to"
"1689900","1690880"," sell to you out there."
"1692040","1694940"," And only you are responsible for that money. "
"1695300","1696720"," I'm not responsible for it."
"1696720","1700460"," Your trader friend in the chat is not responsible for it."
"1700480","1702920"," Your buddies on Fintuit aren't responsible for it. "
"1704080","1706520"," You could have some internet cred, I guess."
"1707020","1713400"," I think that's the only thing that you really win is internet credibility or internet street cred"
"1714000","1717120"," because you're so smart or whatever it is."
"1717780","1720780"," I'm talking about the people that are selling stuff to you to consume, right?"
"1721200","1722020"," That's what they're earning. "
"1722560","1728360"," Or they're earning more subscribers or they're talking about your emotions and feelings and stuff"
"1728360","1728720"," like that."
"1728980","1735140"," But in truth in reality, you're trading your own money and you shouldn't really give a fine fuck"
"1735140","1740960"," what someone is trying to spin to you out there in public."
"1740960","1748780"," You need to have a system in place and work on your own trading so that you're not blowing up"
"1748780","1751660"," your money because on Friday, right?"
"1753000","1756800"," None of those fucking people are coming to pay your bills, are they?"
"1757060","1760280"," None of those fucking people are going to send you a handout. "
"1760780","1766720"," None of those people are going to be there to take your boyfriend or girlfriend or husband or wife"
"1766720","1767440"," out in a date."
"1767980","1769460"," No one's going to pay your kids college."
"1769620","1771680"," No one's going to pay your old college bills. "
"1772020","1772120"," Nobody."
"1772580","1774080"," Nobody's there for you, but you."
"1775160","1778080"," So it feels good when you're consuming that stuff. "
"1778860","1784700"," But then when it comes down to brass tax and you don't get paid, that is where it fucking hurts."
"1785400","1785860"," You disappear."
"1786500","1787880"," You know what knows where you are, right?"
"1788700","1790020"," You're not paying your bills. "
"1790440","1791980"," You're like, God damn it, God damn it."
"1792080","1796780"," Then you're back to feeling better and then you're consuming that Kool-Aid once again, drinking it"
"1796780","1800880"," and whatever anger you have if you're a seller or whatever."
"1804660","1809000"," A flomo feeling that you have as a bully or like a, you're like, we're going to the moon, we're"
"1809000","1811120"," going all the time highs the next week, that kind of shit. "
"1811800","1814540"," Did I stop bull saying that shit coming to the beginning of the year?"
"1814840","1815680"," Not all time highs."
"1815860","1816880"," They were saying like 5,000."
"1817260","1820040"," Feel like 5,200 by March fucking third or something. "
"1820280","1823640"," March 31st, let's say, I was like, they're out of their fucking minds too."
"1824520","1828380"," And so like, you know, paying money on your personality."
"1829460","1836720"," It's easy to allow whatever feeds your personality to start drinking that Kool-Aid. "
"1836940","1839180"," So remember, price action is king."
"1840340","1843880"," Remember that's the key is price action is king."
"1844820","1849400"," And that you use the tools you need to use so that if it goes against you, you know how"
"1849400","1855460"," to exit your trades and that you're keeping a trader logs so that we can go back and take a"
"1855460","1857400"," look at what's working for you and what's not working. "
"1858240","1858800"," All right."
"1860300","1860700"," Absolutely."
"1861020","1861740"," You guys got to. "
"1862080","1868180"," I really want you guys to, if you could for this year, I'm going to ask you to do something,"
"1868460","1868620"," okay?"
"1870300","1875120"," I want you to really like every, if you're, if you're, I don't know how often you guys are trading."
"1875500","1876920"," People come and go out of the stream, right?"
"1877200","1878700"," People go to work, show up on a trade."
"1879500","1882820"," People are fucking, got $500 mail to them on a trade. "
"1883660","1885820"," You got people that are free all day long."
"1885820","1887260"," You got old guys like me, right?"
"1887420","1887780"," We're hanging out."
"1887920","1889100"," We're retired or whatever. "
"1889300","1891720"," And we hang out all day long fucking around."
"1892220","1893880"," But I'm going to be honest with you."
"1895220","1895620"," 100%. "
"1895620","1896920"," I want to be honest with you, okay?"
"1897040","1900020"," So when you're in the stream, people come and go."
"1900640","1903840"," I was looking at some of the stats over the new year."
"1905560","1908880"," And it was fascinating to see my stats for this year. "
"1910980","1917000"," So you've got a lot of people that show up to this stream when they are thinking about taking a"
"1917000","1918680"," trade, okay?"
"1919460","1929380"," Or they're in a trade and they're looking for what do we think about where the"
"1929380","1930640"," market's going at that moment."
"1931200","1935140"," They're trying to reinforce their bias in some way."
"1935520","1936260"," Hey, I'm going to go along here. "
"1936340","1939600"," I'm going to go stop in the show and see if I should take a long enough."
"1939600","1943420"," The key point here for you if you're here more frequently than that."
"1943500","1948740"," If you're here every morning or here all day long or you're here Monday through Friday from 12"
"1948740","1953700"," until 4 p.m. Is that you're going to see people come and go in the stream throughout the day,"
"1953700","1954260"," okay?"
"1954960","1959060"," That same person might not be trading the same schedule that you are, right?"
"1959360","1961060"," So be aware of that. "
"1961160","1969060"," Be aware of all the voices that you hear are not necessarily taking a trade every hour, every 30"
"1969060","1972300"," minutes, every half day, every day of the week."
"1973200","1977400"," So some of that noise that you even hear inside of the stream is are people that are only coming"
"1977400","1982740"," in for a day, three hours, once a week, once a month, whatever it is they're coming in for."
"1983400","1986640"," And you may get the impression that everybody's taken 100 fucking trades. "
"1986640","1987780"," I just look at my trades too."
"1988160","1990000"," I got a Brazilian fucking trades last year."
"1990180","1995520"," I took more trading last year that I've taken ever in my career was last year. "
"1997320","2000040"," I'm around here with you guys all fucking day long."
"2000920","2007140"," But the point here is for you to not put your blinders on sometimes, okay?"
"2008040","2011700"," On social media, put your blinders even on around here sometimes."
"2013180","2015680"," Because you don't know what everyone's doing. "
"2015880","2019180"," You don't know what someone else's trading style is."
"2019400","2021220"," You don't have somebody sold puts or sold calls."
"2021520","2024660"," They just want to make sure that they don't get assigned, right?"
"2024660","2028480"," You don't know what people are asking what they're asking for that kind of stuff. "
"2028960","2031060"," So, back to that original statement."
"2031620","2035140"," For yourself, for this year, do yourself a solid, okay?"
"2035700","2036640"," You don't have to trade every day."
"2036980","2039600"," You don't have to trade six times a day, ten times a day, none of that stuff. "
"2039900","2042580"," Number two, I want you to start too."
"2042700","2048780"," When you do that trader log, I want you to start writing down why you're taking these trades,"
"2054639","2054639"," right?"
"2055440","2057620"," And just quickly write it down."
"2057780","2058800"," Get a notebook or something. "
"2059540","2060000"," Write down."
"2063040","2064179"," We're still going up."
"2066260","2067320"," We should be too. "
"2067620","2070020"," We're going to go to like 470 fucking two, by the way, if you don't know it."
"2076520","2078380"," So, I'm just laughing right now."
"2091520","2093760"," So, keep a log of what you're doing. "
"2094320","2099040"," No, you don't necessarily need a log of what your day trade and zero dates."
"2099040","2100360"," You don't need a log for that."
"2101040","2101640"," You don't. "
"2101840","2105260"," But if you're taking trades that are like about a weekly a monthly about some stock."
"2105260","2106780"," I bought a fucking swing trade."
"2106840","2115240"," I bought, I don't know, a fucking, I sold a fly here and I put some real money down on"
"2115240","2115380"," it. "
"2115620","2117200"," Big money down in this trade, right?"
"2117660","2119960"," I want you to write down why you took that trade."
"2120560","2125380"," What's the overriding reason that you took that trade so we can always go back and look at it in"
"2125380","2129040"," the future or you can and say, hey, I was feeling really bearish here."
"2129120","2133820"," Every time I feel really fucking bearish, take a trade or every time I feel really bullish, taking"
"2133820","2135300"," a trade, right?"
"2135420","2139760"," Or every time I'm really scared and taking along, right?"
"2139840","2141980"," So, I want to hear you say, you worked out. "
"2142080","2143300"," I made money on that day cap."
"2143920","2144880"," The day I was really scared."
"2145360","2147540"," I made a ton of money with calls, right?"
"2147540","2152420"," And the day that I was like super fucking pulled up, it burned, right?"
"2152760","2159000"," So at least go back and look at the reasoning why you're doing these things, whether they were"
"2159000","2159740"," working or not. "
"2161980","2165560"," Now, I got calls from the fucking belt, so I'm long here."
"2165720","2166260"," I'm long here."
"2167740","2174400"," I think I thought I showed you guys this earlier, but I'm expecting something like this. "
"2176720","2183100"," Something like that right there, bounced on Friday down here, and I'm expecting another roll to the"
"2183100","2184400"," downside up here somewhere."
"2185200","2193200"," Somewhere around this 472, maybe 474 up here, but I'm expecting some kind of upside target and then"
"2193200","2194700"," a bigger roll down here."
"2194880","2195760"," That's where you get bearish. "
"2196860","2201060"," And I'm assuming that most of you went into the weekend thinking you're going to wake up this"
"2201060","2201720"," morning to this."
"2201980","2203200"," Yeah, fuck you, that ain't happening."
"2203760","2208960"," And even when we do roll down here, as long as we hold 462, the bulls are fine. "
"2209980","2215260"," Now, if we trade below 462 or anything like that, I'll start getting bearish here."
"2215840","2218520"," There is one other thing you could say about today."
"2218700","2219480"," We could look at here. "
"2220800","2226780"," I did notice over the weekend that Friday's high was not a new high."
"2227220","2229280"," That got me a little scared."
"2229840","2230760"," I don't like seeing that. "
"2230860","2236760"," I always like to see that that new high, even if we roll back down, and we didn't get that."
"2237040","2238840"," So that is a little cause for concern."
"2239100","2241490"," I was scratching my head this morning going, yeah, I'll like seeing that. "
"2241490","2244450"," And even today, I'd really like to see some continuation."
"2245290","2247110"," Get that new high, at least from Friday."
"2247730","2254110"," Come back down and then swing high up here and then not get that roll until we get around 472. "
"2254970","2256150"," Just better positioning."
"2256770","2263790"," If you're a bear and you're looking for a sell play at place to sell, I'd be very interested in"
"2263790","2271470"," selling somewhere up in here."
"2272230","2276030"," We can track when it actually rolls or if it actually rolls or not. "
"2276550","2281810"," But somewhere up in here, I'm looking for a roll to the downside to get down about 4630."
"2283150","2285010"," I think I said somewhere in there, 4620."
"2287390","2290670"," And yeah, let me go back to this really quick. "
"2292510","2300690"," All right, so trader log, please, please keep a trader log and don't be embarrassed about it"
"2300690","2302030"," either, especially if you're a loser."
"2302290","2309530"," If you're not making money, man, if you're like losing, please, please, please keep a trader log"
"2309530","2309890"," this year."
"2310130","2310550"," Write down a piece"
"2310550","2320650"," of"
"2320650","2320650"," paper. "
"2321390","2323310"," Why did you take that trade?"
"2333270","2339410"," Coming up here on SPX, we are at the hourly trigger knocking on the door once more."
"2340230","2341870"," I'm going to draw your attention."
"2342130","2343350"," We can go over there to that really quick. "
"2344410","2345810"," Just be aware here."
"2346750","2347970"," This is the S&P 500."
"2347970","2353410"," And we are above the gamma flip so you can see it right there. "
"2354570","2355610"," Oh, hold on here."
"2355990","2356510"," Uh oh."
"2357250","2358370"," I'm going to go back to half these. "
"2359230","2361750"," I don't know how to go back to half these."
"2362050","2363550"," Okay, so just right over here, right?"
"2364670","2368170"," You got to target to the upside of 472509."
"2368630","2370390"," We are breaking above right now. "
"2370390","2375970"," Ladies and gentlemen, the hourly trigger on the S&P 500 on SPX right now."
"2376650","2381330"," We are also going to head back over to the main screen here and you will have a place to"
"2381330","2382610"," take your money and run up here."
"2383150","2384950"," R1, you guys know how this goes, right?"
"2385290","2386270"," Here's your daily pivots. "
"2386910","2391390"," We're going to trade up here real quick and I really don't care if we get above or not."
"2392110","2394230"," Or if we reject and head back down lower."
"2395210","2399010"," But we do know that this is an area right in here of volatility that we're going to come into. "
"2399010","2402350"," And then your next target to the upside is that 472."
"2402890","2406610"," That's that next gamma level on SPX at least."
"2407810","2409130"," So hang tight one second now. "
"2425240","2426780"," Someone's asking if they're buying calls here."
"2426920","2427760"," Do that just shocks me?"
"2427880","2428880"," People will try to buy calls here."
"2430320","2431780"," I'm going to sell order in up here. "
"2431940","2435040"," So if you break above it or not, you get rejection up here."
"2440110","2443170"," Then what I'm going to try to do here is re-enter a trade."
"2444170","2451170"," So if we squeeze above here, we'll be looking for a pullback at least, maybe even a one minute"
"2451170","2452210"," check back down here. "
"2452890","2455630"," Try to jump back up in here again and take this to R2."
"2457010","2458210"," So don't get left behind."
"2463950","2466110"," Now why did I break that calendar out, right?"
"2466570","2467410"," Why did I get a calendar?"
"2467890","2469270"," I'm going to be listing off to you. "
"2470490","2476530"," And this is going back to this conversation about how you make your money in the course of a year."
"2477830","2479870"," Did I read something this morning from CNBC?"
"2481090","2482190"," Fucking who is it from?"
"2482470","2483150"," Who wrote this shit?"
"2484170","2484810"," I mean, pure diarrhea."
"2485270","2486130"," What did I read this morning?"
"2490240","2494040"," Top Goldman Sachs analyst says the world is moving into a new super cycle. "
"2494680","2495100"," False."
"2496800","2497280"," Bullshit."
"2497660","2497740"," False. "
"2497740","2500740"," Just this fucking book."
"2500960","2502940"," I will give one thing to that article this morning."
"2503140","2504220"," I'll show you guys something here. "
"2506320","2507440"," I'll post it."
"2507600","2509020"," Let me post the link to it for you."
"2509780","2510800"," You guys can read this. "
"2511280","2512940"," Now there's some truth in this article."
"2515360","2518200"," But overall, I'll put this in there for you."
"2520900","2522360"," So here's a good example. "
"2522920","2528840"," So I just listed a, I just listed, I just gave you a post, okay?"
"2533880","2542240"," I'm going to post this inside of, yeah, I just posted this now on both Twitch and YouTube."
"2542840","2547740"," Read that article because there's fucking crazy as the bears."
"2547740","2550840"," This fucking guy is out of his fucking mind. "
"2552780","2555600"," And he's telling you that there's a new super cycle."
"2557440","2559860"," He's out of his fucking mind, okay?"
"2560520","2562400"," We are not in a new super cycle."
"2563600","2566600"," He has some grains of truth in what he's saying, though. "
"2566860","2572580"," He's predicating this on a lot of what I feel, but think, which is rates."
"2572580","2578860"," He's saying get used to rate this rate environment, and it's going to happen for many more years."
"2579660","2582740"," Higher rates for longer than even a year. "
"2583340","2585800"," I don't agree with this statement."
"2587040","2593640"," And the one thing, if there's one thing in the back of my mind that puts me at disagreement here."
"2596480","2600380"," There's one thing in the back of my mind that puts some disagreement with me here. "
"2601680","2609440"," It is going to be that we were at the end of an 18 year housing cycle."
"2609660","2611080"," That's in our report, by the way."
"2612180","2619480"," Now, these cycles run about nine years, but the super cycles run about 18 years. "
"2620200","2623120"," You can easily go back and look at this stuff."
"2623380","2625400"," Now, you guys know I'm in real estate, right?"
"2625400","2632440"," And this 18 year cycle is coming to an end in 2026."
"2634320","2637440"," So we're in 2024, right?"
"2637780","2638500"," We're in 2024. "
"2639340","2646360"," I'm going to start expecting some badness coming in 25 and 26."
"2647580","2650620"," And it will most most likely be multi year."
"2650620","2656680"," If any of you guys out there that are looking for like that 2001 2008 style of at the end"
"2656680","2657960"," of a super cycle. "
"2659900","2662300"," That should start in and around there."
"2662480","2666520"," So when this guy from Goldman Sachs is like, Oh, no, multi year up."
"2667180","2668920"," I'm not on that train with that guy. "
"2669400","2673520"," I think you're at the end of a major bull cycle right now."
"2674120","2678840"," And you're going to get a great kick ass dip to buy this year."
"2678840","2680900"," And the market's going to go up. "
"2681760","2683020"," And then from there."
"2683660","2688180"," When we head into the presidential election and into March."
"2689000","2692120"," Usually January of March of 2025. "
"2693940","2700600"," It's everything in this market should be predicated upon what the Fed does at that point."
"2701360","2704940"," Now we have one example where we did go up for about five years."
"2704940","2710160"," I believe that was in the early 90s into 2001 like 94. "
"2710420","2711360"," I shouldn't say early."
"2711540","2712090"," I guess mid 90s."
"2712820","2717820"," We did have about a five year run, which this guy from Goldman Sachs is likely citing. "
"2718840","2725860"," I'd be where we have higher rates for long persistence, longer rates, a window of a window where"
"2725860","2730820"," the Fed really controls where the market goes window between a soft landing and a hard landing."
"2732480","2734660"," Soft landing in the next recessionary period."
"2735520","2737680"," We're basically giving all of our cards in my view. "
"2737780","2741300"," The way to simplify it is we're basically handing over everything to the Fed."
"2742300","2745820"," And the Fed is truly in control at that point."
"2747500","2749500"," For when they actually begin to cut rates. "
"2749920","2755500"," And the only question that I have at this point would be if they're going to hire for longer."
"2756740","2762580"," Will the drum beat be in the winter of 25 in the early winter of 26."
"2763660","2765520"," Will the drum beat be pay. "
"2765640","2766960"," Look at the price of the stock market."
"2766960","2768040"," We need to raise rates."
"2769580","2774580"," And does he continue to raise rates in those years that could extend that bull market. "
"2775780","2781860"," But even with that bull market being extended, even if it lasts into let's say it lasts in a 2026."
"2783240","2784360"," From 2526."
"2785080","2787140"," This market's going to go to the fucking moon. "
"2787820","2795440"," Like just like straight fucking vertical because we are coming into the end of that super cycle for"
"2795440","2795780"," housing."
"2796280","2799780"," And for me, I'm scared of that."
"2800040","2802540"," That's where a lot of my money lies and lays. "
"2803360","2805080"," And I can assure you of something."
"2805620","2806880"," I'm not the only one."
"2807980","2815200"," Anyone that I know I over this past holiday, I spent time in my real estate investors group. "
"2815520","2822980"," And they're all aware of the end of that super cycle in 2026."
"2823880","2825300"," They're aware of it."
"2825440","2826780"," They're going to they're planning for it. "
"2827560","2832640"," So just like we trade to we trade to different trading styles, right?"
"2832780","2834500"," We know what the LA wave guys are doing."
"2835160","2836680"," We know what the gamma guys are doing."
"2837700","2839740"," We know what the traditional chartists are doing. "
"2840380","2846140"," And we know that at those places, people are going to trade them regardless of we think whatever we"
"2846140","2846580"," think, right?"
"2846720","2848520"," We know that we sometimes have sells there."
"2848540","2850420"," We sometimes have buys, even if we're even going to roll down."
"2850780","2853500"," Even if we're going to keep going higher, you know, people are going to come in to sell and buy"
"2853500","2854960"," at those key levels. "
"2855800","2859140"," And I assure you in that 2026, right?"
"2859600","2864280"," There's going to be a lot of fucking people with money trying to exit the market."
"2864460","2871320"," Now, we could we could stop that would be money printer could stop that in higher rates."
"2871820","2879900"," Higher rates of a blend of money printer and higher rates, but they start cutting on these major"
"2879900","2881200"," things that are going to take place. "
"2881200","2882680"," They start panicking and cutting."
"2883920","2891280"," I'm going to expect that that big bear market to come into the into our stock market in 2026 at"
"2891280","2893360"," the latest sometime in 2026."
"2893880","2896520"," Some kind of a major role 2025 is possible. "
"2897140","2903300"," I'm fascinated to see what Jerome does if he because it would be counterintuitive for him to start"
"2903300","2903660"," to cut."
"2903660","2905860"," In 2026, right?"
"2905960","2912020"," If we blast up that presidential election, we get that volatility kill and we blast into January,"
"2912020","2912700"," March."
"2912860","2916020"," If he's cutting while everybody's screaming for him to raise. "
"2917440","2920640"," I just find it fascinating if that actually takes place."
"2926200","2929960"," Yeah, we're talking short long term debt cycles here, right?"
"2929960","2937540"," And I'm now talking about a housing cycle that tends to coincide with the end of one of these debt"
"2937540","2938020"," cycles."
"2938660","2940260"," So, yeah, I think we go up from here. "
"2940660","2943960"," The only thing this is all predicated upon rates."
"2945040","2946060"," I'll be honest with you guys."
"2947380","2949160"," Rates and then the. "
"2950600","2956200"," Of velocity of unemployment, the velocity of of inflation."
"2957120","2958400"," Those things as well."
"2958520","2960720"," We've talked about them here in the show multiple times. "
"2961020","2965020"," If you start to see the velocity of unemployment heading up into that six, seven percent, eight"
"2965020","2966960"," percent for I should say four."
"2967880","2970580"," Like four to six starts in the angle of unemployment."
"2971200","2972240"," You scream in higher. "
"2972820","2977700"," You see inflation screaming to the downside and bouncing now to the upside."
"2978580","2983920"," You know, near a near vertical V shape recovery, believe it or not, like we hit two percent and"
"2983920","2984840"," bounce straight up."
"2985640","2989020"," So, the velocity of that stuff and then rates to be cut. "
"2989660","2991520"," I'm going to warn you guys of some men."
"2992440","2995300"," I'm going to warn you if you're a bull, I'm going to warn you of something right now."
"2995660","2997860"," Fucking be straight up serious with you. "
"2999200","3001300"," They start cutting fucking rates, right?"
"3002680","3003160"," Run."
"3003740","3006720"," I don't care if we squeeze a hundred fucking points in two days."
"3007460","3007780"," Run. "
"3008040","3009460"," You exit the fucking market."
"3010280","3014740"," And the only way they're going to save those cuts, let's say they do those cuts."
"3015300","3019760"," The only way they save the market when that happens is when they start the fucking money printer"
"3019760","3020120"," up. "
"3020380","3021000"," I'm serious."
"3022520","3026600"," So, even then, don't expect them to start cutting rates."
"3027240","3028020"," The market looks great. "
"3028780","3029560"," They start cutting rates."
"3031220","3033880"," And you're expecting them to turn the money printer on."
"3034000","3035460"," They're still not going to turn it on right away. "
"3035460","3040720"," So, you're almost near guaranteed that major market role that you're looking for."
"3040920","3041420"," I'm warning you."
"3041460","3043920"," If you're a bull, you guys have heard me say this for three fucking years. "
"3044760","3046080"," I'm going to warn you again."
"3046920","3047360"," Talent."
"3049520","3051280"," Historically, you never get out. "
"3051480","3056400"," And it doesn't matter from what I've seen if they cut and then they raise, cut, raise, cut, raise,"
"3056480","3056960"," that kind of shit."
"3057420","3058600"," We still roll major."
"3058900","3060640"," It's still a major fucking downside move. "
"3060840","3061520"," It's pretty, pretty ugly."
"3065460","3066640"," What's going on, Joey Donut?"
"3066760","3067220"," Good morning, brother."
"3067820","3072040"," Yeah, I want to talk about this last thing here with the markets. "
"3072800","3074020"," Joe's probably a good point."
"3074540","3076760"," The market pricing in rate cuts."
"3078620","3080080"," Make yourself a t-shirt. "
"3080300","3081840"," Write this down."
"3082720","3083280"," Right?"
"3083780","3084500"," Make yourself a t-shirt."
"3085580","3091620"," The bond market and the stock market pricing in rate cuts is pure fucking gambling. "
"3092640","3093420"," That's all it is."
"3094140","3094700"," Pure gambling."
"3094700","3097000"," It doesn't mean shit. "
"3097280","3100400"," It has nothing to do at all with reality."
"3101240","3101820"," None of it."
"3101940","3102440"," Never has. "
"3102740","3103120"," Never will."
"3104180","3110400"," When it comes to pricing in the seven rate cuts or now four rate cuts, I saw that talked about"
"3110400","3111560"," last week at some point."
"3112040","3115880"," Please, just like blinders on with that stuff. "
"3116460","3117740"," Truly blinders on."
"3117940","3123980"," You are looking for the velocity in inflation."
"3123980","3125040"," The velocity in unemployment. "
"3125840","3129720"," You're looking for a fed rate cut, actual rate cuts."
"3129840","3130900"," Not what they're pricing in."
"3131300","3131940"," Not what they're thinking. "
"3132580","3133160"," None of that stuff."
"3133360","3139380"," In the Fed, for the first time in history, promised to be honest with you and me, right?"
"3140260","3144100"," They always like throw a wrench at us, right?"
"3144280","3145360"," Do you guys remember that those days?"
"3145840","3149800"," Have you guys been in this market longer than, I don't fucking know, 2024?"
"3149800","3157120"," Anybody in this market longer than five years knows that the Fed used to love to not forewarn us."
"3157460","3164840"," And when we came into COVID, Jerome specifically said, I don't know if this last past Jerome, but"
"3164840","3170420"," Jerome specifically said, I don't know how this came about, but he said, I will always, always from"
"3170420","3177140"," this point forward, telegraph to you what's coming down the road, right?"
"3177640","3178140"," Before it happens. "
"3178140","3180300"," That's a first in our market."
"3180520","3181800"," First in our market."
"3182540","3184240"," So he's telling you higher for longer. "
"3184640","3189700"," I'm going to go with what he's saying that he's going to do unless this will be the only thing"
"3189700","3191240"," that the bear has in my view, right?"
"3191400","3197520"," Right now, the only thing a bear has in my view is either an unknown event to the marketplace,"
"3198080","3201720"," something unknown, something not truly priced in."
"3201720","3209260"," Now, I'm not talking about something where GS has an office somewhere and some shitty country and"
"3209260","3210640"," they know something's going to happen."
"3210640","3213940"," I'm talking about truly unknown, right?"
"3214500","3217560"," Unknown, not priced in to anybody's market. "
"3217560","3219820"," And the second thing would be rate cuts."
"3219900","3225200"," Outside of that, those two things, you guys got another year of a bull market."
"3225380","3225860"," Guaranteed. "
"3226380","3228000"," Guaranteed without those two things happening."
"3228660","3230000"," You're going to have a fucking bull market."
"3230000","3233240"," This market is not going to do what you think it's going to do right now if you're a seller. "
"3233900","3238880"," You think we're going to fucking zero or fucking 3800 3600."
"3238980","3241340"," You're already fucking minds telling you right now."
"3241360","3242240"," You're already fucking minds. "
"3243380","3248120"," No example of this ever in history of history of our stock market of that happening."
"3248440","3250160"," Not a single fucking one."
"3251580","3253420"," So I don't know how to say it yet. "
"3257660","3258800"," Double time, baby."
"3262670","3264550"," Well, you know, like the bond market."
"3266230","3269570"," The bond market is it's not that the bond market is always right. "
"3269710","3273350"," It's that the bond market's smarter than the cash market."
"3273490","3274670"," There's a key difference, right?"
"3274850","3278790"," Bond traders are smarter than stock market traders."
"3279250","3280390"," They tend to be. "
"3281770","3286750"," But there's that other idiom too of don't fight a fucking fed, right?"
"3287150","3288490"," Don't fight the fed."
"3288490","3295190"," And then if you if you guys are watching how the bond market is betting on cuts this year, right?"
"3295430","3297070"," You're betting on seven cuts this year, right?"
"3297370","3298110"," I think it was seven."
"3298250","3300250"," Then it was four that was seven back to seven again, right?"
"3301630","3302510"," Remember back. "
"3303730","3306470"," Every time they've bet in the past, they've been wrong."
"3308110","3308850"," They're wrong."
"3309350","3312770"," So if you're one of those people, they're like, well, I trust the bond market. "
"3312910","3313950"," The bond market's always right."
"3315230","3315950"," Start watching."
"3316310","3317530"," Were they right last year?"
"3317770","3319630"," No, they weren't, right?"
"3320210","3320670"," I was wrong. "
"3320910","3322090"," I thought I was thought we were getting cuts."
"3322290","3325710"," I'm like, Hey, this guy was like, those like drums getting put in a corner right now."
"3326070","3327530"," He's going to be forced into cuts. "
"3327670","3328690"," And that didn't happen."
"3328690","3329110"," Did it?"
"3332410","3336150"," So you have to have if you're in this."
"3336290","3340330"," If you're in any market, you have to accept that you're going to be wrong sometimes. "
"3341310","3344690"," This is not the career for you to be always right, right?"
"3345050","3348310"," You're going to be wrong in this market often."
"3348750","3355230"," So I'd be with Jerome unless we see an actual cut."
"3356050","3360470"," Unless we see an actual cut, I'm going to go with Jerome higher for longer. "
"3361690","3362770"," So I need to see that."
"3363270","3363810"," And no, I don't."
"3364470","3367370"," The market's not going to roll down to the depths of hell, but he's going to be chasing cutting"
"3367370","3368950"," that kind of stuff. "
"3368950","3373770"," And I think that you're going to be living by that sword for this year as well."
"3373970","3377410"," I think you're going to see that argument come into this market all year long."
"3377550","3378790"," I think you're going to have to deal with. "
"3379950","3380730"," Is he cutting?"
"3380750","3381250"," Is he cutting?"
"3381410","3385350"," I think every break decision you come into this year, you're going to get people trying to scare"
"3385350","3385710"," you."
"3385710","3389930"," We're going to go down and be doom and gloom and all that kind of stuff based on that volatility"
"3389930","3390870"," of cuts coming."
"3391570","3393730"," And I don't think it's going to happen to you. "
"3393810","3395130"," I think they would tell you."
"3395290","3396430"," I think he's being serious."
"3396430","3397470"," He's going to hold him longer. "
"3398250","3400090"," And if he holds them longer, they can't sell."
"3400650","3401310"," They can't."
"3401590","3405090"," And there are a lot of fucking people that are long bonds for that to happen. "
"3405490","3407930"," People that you out here out there talking, right?"
"3408210","3409390"," Those guys are long fucking bonds."
"3410050","3411170"," They want to see those cuts."
"3411770","3413650"," And so it is not going to happen. "
"3414310","3414750"," They are waiting."
"3420950","3422050"," The Fed has no balls."
"3422530","3425470"," I don't know if they do or don't. "
"3425470","3431850"," If the Fed has balls and keeps raising outside of normal correction, corrective behavior in the"
"3431850","3436370"," market, unknown events to the market, you're going to see this market keep going up higher and"
"3436370","3439330"," higher and higher and higher in my view."
"3439570","3444590"," If that guy from GS, that link that I posted was correct, he's got, he's correct."
"3445050","3452010"," But I truly believe that that business cycle, that mortgage or that home buyer cycle, those that"
"3452010","3454330"," grand super cycle is going to come bite that in the ass. "
"3454950","3456510"," That's the only way I see that happening."
"3457530","3461150"," The fraud will come into the market, that kind of stuff, too much unemployment, too much inflation."
"3461970","3463290"," All that stuff is going to come in rare. "
"3463450","3463950"," It's ugly head."
"3471520","3474560"," They may continue QT even as they're beginning cutting."
"3474840","3476400"," So Q will not be right away. "
"3476820","3477500"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"3478880","3480480"," That would be the only way to save it though."
"3480760","3482880"," If there was a way to save it, that's what they did in COVID. "
"3483740","3485280"," No, they started printing fucking money."
"3485840","3487940"," They started cutting rates and they started printing money."
"3488880","3490040"," It saved us. "
"3491580","3493000"," That's the only way they would save it."
"3493340","3494860"," The same as they did before."
"3498420","3499720"," Yeah, what's going on Joey Donut?"
"3500680","3501480"," What's skiing, man?"
"3501760","3502680"," What's skiing Saturday and Sunday?"
"3502680","3503420"," I thought I told you. "
"3504680","3506100"," I told you I was going skiing."
"3507400","3509040"," I got, it sucks."
"3509280","3509540"," No, Joe. "
"3509720","3511740"," They said I was going to fucking snow here."
"3512320","3517820"," I was going to skip skiing on Saturday Sunday and skiing doesn't take, I think Wednesday, Thursday"
"3517820","3518500"," off to go skiing."
"3519500","3525120"," And I'm fucking grateful I didn't because last night in the middle of the night I got an alert from"
"3525120","3527200"," the European snow models. "
"3528260","3531840"," And the snow and rain line in Michigan is ridiculous."
"3532440","3533240"," It's like rain."
"3533620","3535200"," The three quarters of the state is rain. "
"3536040","3540620"," And I was expecting like eight to ten inches Wednesday, Thursday."
"3541220","3543820"," Now we're getting fucking rain in 40 mile an hour winds."
"3544060","3544600"," I shit you not. "
"3544600","3545820"," 40 mile an hour winds."
"3548680","3550140"," And rain dude."
"3550620","3551120"," I'm so mad. "
"3551500","3553500"," Like this whole season is going to be dog shit."
"3555960","3556680"," All right."
"3556800","3556920"," All right. "
"3556980","3557760"," What do we got going on here?"
"3559440","3560580"," What's going on Chase?"
"3563990","3565190"," What's going on brother?"
"3566910","3568050"," Print my calls."
"3568990","3570050"," Now print my puts."
"3571330","3573570"," Have we selling this here or more up?"
"3574310","3576230"," I don't know if we're selling this here. "
"3577010","3578630"," This looks like it's going to just consolidate."
"3579090","3581690"," I'd really like to see us hit that 472 chase."
"3582790","3584530"," 472, 474, somewhere in there brother. "
"3584970","3586070"," That's what I'd really like to see them in."
"3587990","3589310"," I don't think we're selling this bro."
"3590130","3594090"," And if you're looking to go short, you already know what to do right Chase. "
"3595170","3600950"," You want to see that bear cross brother on the one and five minute before you enter anything like"
"3600950","3601150"," that."
"3608330","3609530"," You guys want to look at it."
"3609570","3610190"," I'm really quick. "
"3610530","3611070"," See look."
"3621400","3622960"," It looks so sexy."
"3623180","3623460"," Look at that. "
"3623680","3624180"," Oh my God."
"3624220","3625580"," Look at how sexy that is."
"3627000","3629720"," That's like fucking straight beast mode right there. "
"3629720","3633560"," You got a one minute or you got a five minute cross and a half hour right now in IWM."
"3634200","3638040"," You got price above the hourly trigger in a back test already on the hourly trigger."
"3638040","3639200"," This is IWM by the way. "
"3639800","3641840"," It's already you've got successful."
"3642540","3647680"," You got a successful back test of the half hour trigger successful back test of the hourly trigger."
"3648560","3655120"," I am bullish here in IWM for the you should see it act more like tech normally does. "
"3655620","3658600"," You've got a higher hide right here."
"3659060","3661980"," I have a target to the upside of."
"3665320","3665960"," There. "
"3666620","3668940"," And then another target right over there."
"3674190","3675690"," One more right over here."
"3679410","3689270"," Target one ninety five on IWM one ninety five forty somewhere in there somewhere"
"3689270","3689630"," in there. "
"3689710","3695470"," If you didn't buy any of this you're looking for a place to buy one ninety three."
"3695950","3700030"," I know a scratch that you could see a pullback here."
"3702420","3707100"," But I'd be looking for I'd either be looking straight up to go straight up and tag that one ninety"
"3707100","3707360"," five. "
"3707360","3712280"," But if we do get a pullback be trying to buy one ninety three sixty six."
"3715020","3718860"," As that five minute trigger crosses that hourly trigger you could see a pullback."
"3719340","3721180"," See what you'd be looking for is this. "
"3723780","3727000"," This five minute in the time is right now ten to one ten thirty."
"3727680","3732460"," So I would say you know by eleven a.m. or something like that you get a pullback right here."
"3733100","3734620"," If this holds right here. "
"3735280","3738980"," Come back up get above this one minute trigger and then you're going to jump back in."
"3739860","3744220"," I'm actually on the pullback saying just draw that up for a really quick so you can snap a line"
"3744220","3745560"," and hold on."
"3747710","3749090"," Get rid of that one for you. "
"3751310","3754650"," If you if you if you missed the ride I should say."
"3755770","3757630"," Back down here check that one."
"3761190","3765630"," With that this successful we should break right there. "

"4231870","4233350"," I've been like this for years with Elon."
"4233350","4241980"," It's like we got an NDX at 16, 493."
"4244720","4247500"," So that's 16, 500 is going to be a sell point. "
"4248580","4249860"," Team X rolling down this morning."
"4250060","4250420"," Good to see."
"4251500","4253860"," Remember we talked about last week. "
"4254000","4259780"," I talked to you guys earlier in the week about how that inverted yield curve."

"4261700","4263300"," We're seeing it right now this morning. "
"4266170","4268150"," Vicks head and lower 1558."
"4269290","4270850"," They got the gap down below it."

"4275070","4275710"," Be careful."
"4276110","4276510"," Careful."
"4276610","4278150"," The false break out here on spy. "
"4280230","4283670"," You know, are you going to sign with the drug thing with Elon?"
"4286980","4288280"," Hey, Devin was the same."
"4288500","4289800"," Hey, Devin was the Elon."
"4290100","4291480"," I want to know what the Elon stuff is. "
"4291820","4293780"," I want to know if it matches up what I got, but."
"4294570","4299280"," I watched a video of a guy last night that went down the."
"4299680","4300380"," There's a."
"4301300","4302120"," There's like a."
"4302360","4303960"," Okay, you got like Tesla Q, right?"
"4304860","4307120"," And then you've got a Tesla gang. "
"4307520","4309920"," We know about Tesla Q and Tesla gang, right?"
"4310860","4312340"," We know that."
"4315140","4315840"," They're not."
"4316720","4317920"," Neither are really. "
"4318240","4319380"," I mean, both have qualities."
"4320740","4322200"," But neither are reliable."
"4323080","4323820"," As well. "
"4324300","4327120"," Both sides are really have interests."
"4330320","4331880"," That infect both sides."
"4332160","4333500"," I guess I was infected, but. "
"4334820","4336560"," You've got ulterior motives, right?"
"4336680","4338320"," Same as we talked about the open this morning, right?"
"4339240","4342820"," I got people with their own their own message."
"4342820","4344520"," They want to get across to you, right?"
"4346580","4348400"," Then there's like people like me."
"4349400","4349820"," And. "
"4352140","4353860"," You know, people like me are."
"4355180","4357500"," I am fascinated by self driving."
"4358220","4361000"," Fascinated by mass transit. "
"4361940","4363620"," I'm fascinated by."
"4367080","4373080"," The existential threat of artificial intelligence and robotics in this country around the world."
"4373080","4374560"," I should say not the country, but the world. "
"4374980","4376100"," The dangers of it."
"4377320","4377680"," And."
"4380380","4381460"," Being able to get off world. "
"4381660","4382800"," I know people are like, no, let's do it."
"4382820","4383320"," Get with this world."
"4383320","4384820"," But truly being able to get off world. "
"4386700","4388660"," That kind of stuff does matter to me."
"4389500","4390660"," And so, of course."
"4391880","4394360"," I have a hard time squaring myself with Elon often times. "
"4394660","4396960"," You guys already know my story about why I believe in Elon."
"4397800","4401720"," Even if he is a fraud, I really don't care how hard he was saying, right?"
"4402500","4402960"," That's the."
"4403680","4404240"," You get. "
"4404840","4408700"," You get laziness for lack of a better word."
"4409520","4412320"," When you don't have that entity."
"4413160","4413800"," Pushing. "
"4414320","4415820"," It's why we are here."
"4416440","4418000"," As a nation to."
"4420060","4421320"," We need. "
"4421780","4426200"," We need like Mavericks trying to push the envelope at all times."
"4426480","4427220"," We know what happens."
"4428540","4430620"," In societies that don't do that, right?"
"4430800","4431340"," We've seen it. "
"4431500","4432600"," We've seen examples of it."
"4432680","4434620"," The USSR is one of them, right?"
"4435380","4435820"," We know it."
"4436080","4436680"," So when you get to these. "
"4437320","4439600"," Of course, there's extremes with that as well, right?"
"4439880","4441880"," You don't want to be or put all your eggs in."
"4442500","4445540"," That one person or that one envelope pusher."
"4447020","4450620"," But you do want them to push the envelope to drag everybody else along with them as well, right?"
"4450620","4459600"," I was watching a guy this weekend did this big video about self driving and. "
"4462420","4465000"," Oh man, you know, it's like."
"4466200","4468020"," When does that come back to roost?"
"4469880","4473400"," I'm just going to find a link to it and show it to you guys in what sucked about the"
"4473400","4473940"," video was."
"4474560","4478000"," There's a lot of commentary on it by Tesla gang. "
"4478000","4479620"," Just ripping this guy."
"4480180","4484720"," This guy is like, this guy is like me is moved forward thinking wants to see progress, all that"
"4484720","4485160"," kind of stuff."
"4485880","4491000"," And a lot of people didn't listen the entire listen to the entire video to the end the last 10"
"4491000","4493140"," minutes of what this guy was saying. "
"4494120","4501820"," I'm very similar to this guy in his take on self driving and stuff like that self driving cars."
"4502500","4504260"," But there's a lot of truth with this guy was saying."
"4504260","4509420"," I'm wondering what you what your thoughts were on Elon over the weekend because the stuff about"
"4509420","4518220"," Elon with the drugs, you know, like it looks so desperate to me when you when there's better stuff"
"4518220","4518900"," to be looking at. "
"4519640","4525140"," Rather than the desperation posts about him being high or whatever and all other shit."
"4525300","4527820"," Like there's the shit they throw at him on the wall."
"4527840","4529340"," I'm like that shit is nothing. "
"4529340","4536300"," I'm like why do they it looks like people are grasping for straws against Elon when there's easier"
"4536300","4537300"," things to go after."
"4544670","4545730"," Yeah, that's the thing Bork."
"4545890","4546330"," I agree with that. "
"4548770","4549750"," That's just the drug stuff."
"4549950","4550090"," Okay."
"4550550","4550750"," Yeah. "
"4550870","4551730"," So it is just the drug stuff."
"4552350","4552590"," Yeah."
"4552770","4554550"," The drug stuff isn't doesn't do it for me. "
"4556290","4560630"," There's real true like there's a part to like self driving."
"4561230","4562790"," It's been like self driving."
"4563030","4568850"," You can you guys know you can get like a you can hack self driving and some vehicles that are"
"4568850","4569510"," already being made. "
"4569830","4574530"," There's like a part of this like there's a whole part of this like self driving stuff that is grind"
"4574530","4580770"," in my ass and like just like stop signs are meant for humans."
"4581490","4582870"," Roads are meant for humans."
"4583290","4585890"," We need different roads for self driving. "
"4586590","4589210"," We need like a fundamental shift in our society."
"4591430","4595170"," That doesn't involve Elon that involves like you and I people."
"4604480","4607140"," For coming with the largest key man risk probably ever. "
"4607440","4615580"," I don't know like I don't forget certain things like I don't forget that I'll never forget that."
"4618080","4621640"," Like I read an article last week that said I read an article last week that said."
"4622640","4626980"," Tesla finally has some competition and I'm like wait a minute. "
"4627580","4628620"," He wants that competition."
"4629300","4630720"," That's the old school along right."
"4631400","4635320"," I want to drag other companies along with me. "
"4635920","4637400"," Not necessarily beat him either."
"4638180","4642640"," Just drag people there and I think that's the key for me as well."
"4651070","4652430"," No, I did not see that. "
"4652570","4654470"," I will try to catch that."
"4654630","4656190"," Do you know what the name of that documentary was?"
"4656610","4658250"," I did not catch that documentary."
"4660070","4661770"," Yeah, the drug stuff doesn't for you. "
"4662470","4665290"," From my experience, they're all doing drugs."
"4666230","4666930"," All of them."
"4667610","4670170"," All the CEOs, all their families, all their friends. "
"4670630","4671370"," I know these guys."
"4671650","4672330"," I've met these guys."
"4673130","4674090"," I used to ski with these people. "
"4674310","4675250"," I used to go to Burning Man with these."
"4675390","4678570"," I used to go to Burning Man with tech pros back in the way back in the day."
"4679170","4679970"," Wall Street, Burning Days. "
"4681210","4683390"," And then I lived in Vale."
"4683390","4685950"," I lived in those places."
"4687130","4688350"," And those people hang out there. "
"4688630","4689590"," It's a very small town."
"4689910","4690470"," You just hang out with those."
"4690570","4691430"," You meet them really quickly. "
"4692410","4693910"," And those people are not you and I."
"4694790","4697190"," I don't give a fuck who they are and what they're doing."
"4697190","4698450"," I don't care if I'm not going to name names."
"4698870","4700290"," I was just going to almost live in this name slip. "
"4700610","4703410"," But I only have Fortune 500 companies."
"4704730","4706150"," They live a different life than you and I."
"4708790","4709410"," Super pumped."
"4709650","4709730"," Okay. "
"4709990","4710230"," Look it up."
"4712270","4713830"," Oh, you like to do the drug stuff too."
"4713830","4714350"," Yeah, yeah. "
"4714550","4716450"," No, they live a different fucking life."
"4716690","4717590"," You're wealthy and rich."
"4717590","4719110"," You live a different life than normal people. "
"4719110","4720350"," That was my only point was."
"4722810","4723590"," Is he on drugs?"
"4725490","4729530"," I did find it funny that they said that he's passed every single drug test."
"4729770","4730650"," Yeah, I fucking would too. "
"4731150","4733950"," When we're the richest man in the world, you're going to fucking pass every goddamn drug test."
"4734390","4735530"," What is that?"
"4737910","4738950"," That's fucking stupid."
"4739570","4747510"," Yeah, you want to see it?"
"4747650","4748370"," I'll send it back. "
"4748570","4749430"," We didn't get it right now."
"4749570","4749750"," Hold on."
"4751650","4753110"," Now, there is a part. "
"4754150","4757370"," This guy is probably a part of a movement."
"4759170","4760370"," A far left."
"4760630","4762390"," I gotta be honest with you guys about this guy. "
"4762550","4767770"," This guy is likely a part of a far left movement for more mass transit."
"4770510","4779310"," Then then self driving cars or autonomous cars or FSD or electric vehicles."
"4779950","4782050"," I really don't care if he is or isn't. "
"4782610","4789370"," I care more about the technology making the next jump."
"4790570","4797150"," And what ultimately does happen is probably what this guy is saying, but it's probably more like"
"4797150","4798230"," 100 years down the road."
"4799550","4803190"," 200 years down the road, but he's trying to bring up the conversation of what's the next step?"
"4803590","4804290"," How do we get there?"
"4805030","4810290"," It does involve thinking that's not 10 years down the road. "
"4810370","4811490"," It's like 100 years down the road."
"4812170","4813150"," Let's see if we can find it real quick."
"4815290","4817750"," Let's see what your thoughts are on this too. "
"4822980","4824440"," I think Titan is going to find it."
"4824900","4825940"," Watch the whole thing too."
"4826340","4828220"," You know, I'm a testable. "
"4828540","4829900"," One of you guys know that I'm a testable."
"4830100","4831220"," I don't think Tesla is going away."
"4833920","4835140"," One quick second here. "
"4835240","4835920"," See if I find this."
"4840110","4845330"," Now, this is probably going to elicit a lot of emotions if you're a testable."
"4846050","4852870"," And if you're a Tesla bear, like Tesla Q or Tesla boy, I think this video could be misconstrued by"
"4852870","4854150"," Tesla Q."
"4855250","4862190"," And I think it can also, I think that if you're Tesla Q and you're watching this video, you're"
"4862190","4869110"," likely looking at it from the perspective or from a perspective of a short term. "
"4869110","4871250"," Yeah, this is proving my point."
"4872110","4873410"," But in reality, it's not."
"4873890","4875710"," It's really bad for ice vehicles. "
"4876590","4878250"," The real true point behind this video."
"4878250","4885090"," But if you're a Tesla bull, you probably don't like this video either because, of course, nothing's"
"4885090","4885890"," ever wrong, right?"
"4886170","4895550"," And I think what this guy to me is trying to say is there's this next electric vehicle self-driving"
"4895550","4902550"," evolution that needs to take place from a societal infrastructure viewpoint."
"4903350","4909270"," Now, this guy's view, I think, is more geared towards everybody taking a bus and a train and shit,"
"4909370","4910290"," which I'm not on. "
"4910450","4913170"," Oh, I get that that's probably an eventuality."
"4914150","4915970"," But anyway, I'll post it."
"4916130","4918610"," Don't get mad at me for posting this if you're a Tesla bull, okay?"
"4920150","4921870"," Just watch the video to the end. "
"4922870","4925450"," Don't make any assumptions until you come to this guy's conclusion here."
"4926750","4928450"," I'm going to post the link to it right now."
"4932050","4933430"," Yeah, I could probably do a reaction. "
"4933550","4935310"," I could probably do a reaction video to this."
"4935570","4936810"," I wouldn't mind doing that, Bork."
"4937330","4938830"," Or if one of you guys wanted to do one. "
"4940070","4941910"," Or maybe we do one as a group or something."
"4942030","4942930"," I could play the video."
"4943490","4944950"," We could do a reaction video to it. "
"4945010","4945310"," That'd be cool."
"4945930","4949130"," I'd be interested to see what people's takes are on this video."
"4954000","4955300"," Yeah, it's has a linear linear. "
"4955820","4956040"," Yeah."
"4957520","4958340"," You know, it's more."
"4959840","4961140"," I'm more there too. "
"4962500","4966460"," I know the problems that we have with the lot of the problems we have with Tesla too."
"4967100","4968460"," I have a family that works for Tesla."
"4969040","4971880"," I have actual family members that work for Tesla. "
"4972080","4977420"," And I have friends that have worked on and off for Tesla for decades."
"4978700","4982100"," So for Elon, I should say for decades."
"4982640","4985120"," And then we actually have a, we actually have someone in our group. "
"4986660","4990260"," That's what is a prior SpaceX and Apple employee too."
"4990660","4992780"," He has some experience with Elon as well."
"4999490","5000650"," That'd be kind of cool, wouldn't it?"
"5000790","5001970"," I'd watch this video with you guys. "
"5002230","5003770"," I'd be fascinated to know what you guys think of this."
"5008490","5012610"," I want you to pay attention here to, I'm going to check this one more time."
"5012850","5014930"," But I want you to pay attention right here. "
"5016590","5017730"," Just right here."
"5017830","5017910"," Okay."
"5018070","5019150"," That blue line right there. "
"5019270","5020010"," That's a gamma bar."
"5020590","5022230"," It's at 4725."
"5022790","5023010"," Okay. "
"5023570","5028410"," 4725 at home, if you're long calls right now, can we look for looking for some cell signal on that,"
"5028410","5030090"," on that tag to the upside there."
"5030530","5032690"," I'm going to bring it down for you right now so you can see it."
"5033550","5035150"," And I think I'm going to switch it to a."
"5036310","5037790"," I might have one minute chart here. "
"5037870","5038430"," I don't think I am."
"5038550","5039470"," Maybe I am in a one minute chart."
"5039770","5039850"," Okay. "
"5040710","5042630"," Keep your eyes on this gamma bar."
"5043210","5045490"," More so than the more so than the."
"5046670","5048450"," In the R2 above up here. "
"5049750","5051570"," Keep your eyes in that gamma bar there."
"5052530","5053790"," 4725 on SPX."
"5057320","5060920"," I'm going to check, make sure I got this check one more thing here. "
"5062640","5065520"," Make sure my, my levels are correct here."
"5086560","5087760"," Oh, wait a minute here."
"5091280","5093040"," They have changed at this point. "
"5093680","5095220"," That bar is not there any longer."
"5097200","5097760"," 4750."
"5100560","5101120"," 4750. "
"5104780","5106520"," The scratch right just said there."
"5108080","5111400"," Look for a target of R2 and possibly even R3."
"5113140","5114160"," Maybe even higher. "
"5114460","5115680"," I'm going to do an STX cell above."
"5117140","5120100"," I got 4750 as the next gamma level to the upside."
"5127280","5128200"," Yeah, it is. "
"5128480","5130560"," Self-driving is the largest tech disruptor."
"5131600","5132700"," It really is."
"5134480","5136060"," It really truly is. "
"5163790","5165130"," Sending us to the moon again."
"5170000","5171240"," Give me a quick second."
"5171380","5172260"," I'm going to take a quick break here. "
"5172400","5173420"," Give me a five minutes here."
"5173520","5175840"," I'm going to take a quick fast five minute break here."
"5176960","5178720"," Let me just check some previous. "
"5179560","5180440"," Just right in here."
"5180600","5180740"," Okay."
"5180740","5181940"," Let me go for this. "
"5184440","5185720"," Just right in here."
"5185780","5186140"," It's like a peak."
"5187280","5188380"," We're going to put some. "
"5206820","5208840"," Another one back over here."
"5214740","5216260"," Back to the main screen."
"5218980","5221360"," Just a little bit of volatility right there. "
"5222940","5226200"," You can see that one right there."
"5230530","5232310"," Just right there if you want a place to."
"5233810","5235890"," Place for you to look here. "
"5240450","5243490"," You haven't had a five minute check back at all this morning."
"5243770","5246270"," So that wouldn't shock me to see a five minute check back here."
"5247850","5249090"," Raise that a little bit. "
"5249530","5252070"," And then that one should be right about there."
"5263760","5270040"," You think that instead of FSD, we should just employ remote workers that are displaced by a GI to"
"5270040","5272600"," have virtual car steps in our homes to monitor self-driving cars."
"5273220","5274760"," So you're going to feel the blanks renewed in real time. "
"5275800","5276640"," I like that."
"5279040","5284930"," To be lynched for the entire move is reliable base load."
"5285530","5286090"," Hold on power. "
"5286390","5287310"," Wind sore definitely isn't it."
"5287470","5291390"," We need a stepping stone between carbon and whatever new and limited power technology emerges."
"5291770","5292350"," I agree with that too. "
"5292890","5294890"," That's a big that's a big talk, right?"
"5295930","5297610"," Bull for trade on you with that."
"5297630","5299530"," There are a lot of issues to overcome with that too."
"5301790","5303110"," Yeah, live reaction Vids. "
"5303190","5304130"," We've never done one of those heavily."
"5307160","5308500"," What else we got going on here?"
"5310200","5310740"," Hey, Dan."
"5310920","5311340"," How you doing brother?"
"5312340","5313760"," Yeah, I'm feeling better better, man. "
"5313980","5316360"," So I ended up doing for Christmas was I got sick."
"5317040","5320100"," I think I had what is it?"
"5320420","5321080"," What's the one called?"
"5322260","5323380"," I think I had the."
"5325240","5326020"," Not the flu. "
"5326280","5326840"," I already had the flu."
"5327440","5329780"," Dude, I had the flu shot and the COVID shot."
"5330220","5331600"," I got fucking COVID. "
"5333060","5333500"," Thanks."
"5334240","5334680"," Halloween."
"5334920","5335420"," I got COVID. "
"5336240","5339600"," Then I got nasty case of the flutter and Thanksgiving and then Christmas."
"5340280","5341580"," Is it RSV or something?"
"5342000","5342560"," The other one is."
"5343160","5345800"," So during Christmas and it was all split up. "
"5345800","5347200"," It was like, Oh, here's the temperature."
"5348040","5348560"," Here's the cough."
"5349080","5351420"," It was all like separate and it lasted. "
"5351900","5353000"," I didn't get bronchitis though."
"5353400","5355740"," I felt better towards New Year's."
"5355900","5358560"," I ended up actually going back to my family. "
"5358780","5360960"," Was that my family's for Christmas?"
"5361920","5363420"," And we were like, everybody got sick."
"5363520","5363880"," It was bad."
"5364680","5365640"," It was a fucking shit show. "
"5366140","5369560"," Went back to do New Year's to try to re like re."
"5371880","5373700"," Relive Christmas or something like that."
"5373920","5376840"," So went back and did the family thing for New Year's. "
"5376840","5379020"," I feel great right now, by the way."
"5379400","5381700"," And did some skiing this past weekend."
"5382000","5382840"," So I felt good about that. "
"5383420","5385080"," So it's nice to be back in the saddle again."
"5385860","5387120"," I appreciate your asking, brother."
"5388440","5389160"," Yeah, dude. "
"5390420","5394700"," So I was telling my so ready for this then."
"5394820","5399660"," So my kids were home until this year."
"5400960","5403900"," And my youngest went back to in person school. "
"5404820","5407700"," And I told my wife, I remember getting the shots going."
"5408040","5408820"," This is going to help."
"5409560","5410480"," And it just didn't. "
"5410600","5414580"," My youngest has just brought home every fucking thing."
"5415260","5416180"," And the teacher."
"5417020","5418580"," This is crazy too. "
"5418760","5419520"," You guys ready for this crazy?"
"5419820","5421100"," You guys ready for this crazy shit?"
"5421460","5422040"," This is all true."
"5423320","5427100"," Like we got COVID and I didn't want to send her back to school."
"5427980","5429220"," The school was like, no, no, no. "
"5429480","5432580"," No, they're not showing any signs exhibiting any of this or that."
"5432580","5434620"," I sent him back to school, right?"
"5435740","5437980"," The flu came in for Thanksgiving."
"5439140","5440000"," Same story. "
"5440860","5441380"," No temperature."
"5442560","5443500"," Set on the school."
"5444780","5445340"," Christmas. "
"5446860","5448220"," Fucking Christmas, right?"
"5450680","5451780"," Teachers out of school."
"5452060","5452860"," Teachers out of school."
"5453380","5454020"," But I didn't know this. "
"5454260","5457080"," I know it now, but teacher was out sick."
"5457320","5458160"," The whole school was out sick."
"5458440","5459040"," Teachers out sick. "
"5459160","5460700"," It was a fucking war zone."
"5461720","5464260"," Finally, get an email from the teacher."
"5465220","5466960"," Stop sending your fucking kids to school. "
"5467120","5467800"," And I'm like, wait a minute."
"5467900","5471000"," You guys are first like first part of this year."
"5471020","5473280"," You guys were all like fucking send them all to school. "
"5474040","5475160"," These kids this year."
"5475400","5476100"," I don't know what your experience."
"5476100","5478080"," If you got kids out there and what your experiences were. "
"5478600","5479400"," All right, our house."
"5479940","5480840"," It was a disaster."
"5482100","5485660"," Every fucking cold you could get came our way. "
"5486180","5489940"," I'm assuming part of it is because we had."
"5489940","5491820"," Quarantine for so long."
"5492000","5494320"," I haven't been sick in four years. "
"5494980","5495540"," 2019."
"5496060","5498680"," So when it was was it was it 19 or 20?"
"5498940","5499940"," Over years."
"5500800","5502600"," Whenever the shutdown happened, right?"
"5503000","5504300"," I think that was February, March. "
"5504660","5505700"," Whenever that happened."
"5507420","5509220"," I haven't been sick since then."
"5509740","5511360"," And I mean zero. "
"5512280","5513680"," Until my daughter went back to school."
"5514000","5515720"," And since then it's been a fucking train."
"5515780","5517280"," It's been like, hey, buddy. "
"5518180","5519060"," What did you miss?"
"5519440","5520380"," We got everything for you."
"5521080","5521900"," I got all the sickness."
"5522160","5524060"," You missed for right fucking now. "
"5527300","5528460"," I'm telling you, dude."
"5528980","5531520"," Like maybe you guys already went through this."
"5531600","5533600"," Maybe you said your kids back last year or the year before. "
"5534020","5534560"," We're late."
"5535060","5536040"," Our family is late."
"5537200","5538120"," And we got. "
"5538640","5539700"," It's been gross."
"5541080","5542040"," Straight rose."
"5543160","5545420"," Never, never, never, never in my life. "
"5545960","5547060"," Ever been that sick."
"5547380","5548780"," Like, like boom sick."
"5549200","5549800"," Feel good. "
"5550140","5550460"," Boom sick."
"5550720","5551020"," Feel good."
"5552440","5552540"," Never. "
"5552760","5553580"," Even the kids were in school."
"5554140","5555580"," Never, ever have been that sick."
"5555940","5557860"," Ever, ever, ever, ever, ever. "
"5563800","5564940"," You want to wear a bill, Tom?"
"5565100","5565360"," How are you?"
"5566460","5566900"," Good to see you brother."
"5577520","5581060"," Yeah, no, I do like the kids, man."
"5581520","5583180"," I'm telling you like they're disgusting. "
"5584140","5586220"," Do they try with my youngest too?"
"5586460","5587280"," Like I try."
"5588840","5589760"," They're still dirty."
"5590360","5591280"," She's super dirty. "
"5591680","5592980"," She's dirty than the older one."
"5593120","5593600"," I got to be honest."
"5594440","5596060"," The older one was never as dirty as this one. "
"5596320","5597520"," The older one listens to me."
"5598440","5600480"," The older one I'm like, you do this, you do that."
"5600800","5601260"," This would be great. "
"5602100","5602900"," It's like I got you daddy."
"5602900","5604880"," Like I love this child."
"5605120","5605620"," The youngest one?"
"5606460","5607700"," You'll fuck yourself, daddy. "
"5608280","5608800"," I got this."
"5609300","5610600"," And I'm going to bring home a bunch of shit to you."
"5611380","5612320"," That's basically her. "
"5613160","5613700"," I love her."
"5614320","5615480"," I love her more than the entire world."
"5616600","5621260"," But she's the one that's like, she's the one that's like, I'll figure it out on my own. "
"5621480","5622980"," In the meanwhile, watch out for my weight."
"5626020","5627280"," More Anita, how are you, man?"
"5627640","5628120"," Good to see you brother."
"5634490","5636450"," Well, so ready for this mobile land?"
"5636990","5640550"," My youngest switched into the taking a shower in the morning. "
"5640970","5643490"," And I'm fighting with her right now."
"5643830","5646670"," I'm like, you're taking your showers when you get home from school."
"5647430","5649430"," Like, no more morning showers. "
"5649910","5654530"," You're not like, Linus all day long in the house and stuff."
"5655210","5656790"," Take the shower after or you have to school."
"5656790","5657850"," I just started telling her that. "
"5658070","5658410"," She's fine."
"5658570","5659290"," Matter of fact, this morning."
"5660170","5661350"," She took a shower this morning. "
"5661490","5662890"," So I'm like, I got to talk to her again."
"5667010","5667690"," Yeah, dude."
"5667910","5668690"," Oh, she's nasty. "
"5669430","5673670"," She's got like, what's the start growing the hippie here and stuff, because she's not brushing her"
"5673670","5673870"," hair."
"5674350","5676190"," I got a dirty hippie."
"5678390","5679350"," It's gross, dude. "
"5679630","5680850"," I'm telling you, it's disgusting."
"5682790","5683510"," It's disgusting."
"5683910","5685030"," And I got the flu shot, man. "
"5685350","5686470"," Like, didn't work."
"5687250","5689870"," They were like, whatever the fucking flu was like, fuck that, buddy."
"5691590","5692870"," I got the, I got the brain. "
"5692870","5693750"," I had a new COVID shot."
"5693950","5694450"," That didn't work."
"5694730","5695330"," I got COVID. "
"5697790","5698730"," When did I get that shot?"
"5699550","5701090"," I want to say I got it mid September."
"5702930","5704430"," And I went through Halloween."
"5706230","5709110"," And I was like doing all the dad stuff. "
"5709550","5710670"," Like the lead up of Halloween."
"5710890","5712950"," Like the four or five days before I was going to go to this party."
"5713070","5713670"," I'm going to go to that party. "
"5713750","5715290"," I'm going to take the kids over there and we'll do that with the kids."
"5716270","5716810"," Halloween, Halloween."
"5717670","5719050"," The 31st of October. "
"5720570","5720850"," Down."
"5722250","5723050"," Like down."
"5723730","5724990"," First time getting COVID. "
"5725670","5726910"," First time getting COVID."
"5730580","5732160"," Yeah, yeah, the vaccines."
"5732420","5732940"," I got to, man. "
"5733000","5733400"," I travel."
"5733820","5734720"," I fucking travel."
"5734780","5735640"," I have to. "
"5735900","5736300"," Schools."
"5736500","5736940"," You name it."
"5737020","5737740"," All kinds of stuff. "
"5738440","5739800"," I got to do the vaccines, man."
"5740300","5741120"," You got to do them."
"5741540","5741980"," Got to. "
"5742760","5743760"," You know what?"
"5743840","5744960"," The only vaccine that ever regretted."
"5745160","5746340"," If I had one vaccine that I regretted."
"5747880","5752060"," It was, um, if I had one vaccine, I regretted it was the anthrax vaccine. "
"5752060","5753020"," That was the one that."
"5753380","5756040"," That was the one that really broke my ass."
"5757240","5758820"," Was, uh, anthrax. "
"5760080","5762500"," That was the one that I'm sketched out even to this day about."
"5763260","5764740"," A lot of people got sick from that."
"5765460","5766620"," I was young too, man. "
"5771750","5772750"," Yeah, you know, nothing."
"5772970","5776770"," Um, I know there's, I know that that it doesn't prevent, but I got sick."
"5777310","5781230"," Or if I guess if I wasn't vaccinated, maybe I would have been even worse. "
"5781790","5782710"," I do realize that board."
"5783190","5784170"," I got, I'm with you on that brother."
"5785570","5786450"," Uh, 100%. "
"5786450","5787950"," But I got real sick."
"5788230","5793090"," Like, uh, COVID, I didn't get the, uh, I didn't get the brain fog that I thought it would have."
"5793230","5795730"," I didn't lose my set and lose my sense of taste or smell. "
"5797230","5800610"," Um, I got some of the brain fog though, but it wasn't quite fog."
"5800950","5805610"," It was like, um, I didn't feel confident in my decision making ability."
"5805910","5814150"," It was a better way to describe that. "
"5814150","5815510"," It was bizarre."
"5816570","5818530"," It was like separated being sick."
"5819750","5821370"," That was, that was kind of unique to me. "
"5821410","5823190"," I've never had a sickness like that either."
"5823810","5826250"," COVID was, was novel to me."
"5826570","5831630"," My experience being sick and this, whatever this RSV stuff was, was novel to me or that I recall. "
"5832630","5836550"," I may have had it when I was a kid, but I don't recall the way that I got sick."
"5841370","5842930"," Uh, not get cancer vaccine."
"5843410","5843490"," Yeah. "
"5843850","5845130"," Um, I was in the army."
"5845130","5851070"," So you're like, well, army and then college and then travel, right?"
"5851270","5854830"," So you're required to get shots for all your travel, depending where you're going."
"5854830","5857610"," You get needs specific shots for wherever you're traveling to. "
"5857790","5858370"," That's number one."
"5858890","5862410"," And then number two being in the army, they shoot you full of shit."
"5862910","5869170"," And then every time you get deployed, regardless of you having those fucking shots, they'll do it"
"5869170","5869850"," again to you. "
"5871090","5873510"," Um, I've, I ran into that shit too in the army."
"5873510","5874950"," So I'm kind of used to it."
"5876030","5881230"," Uh, being vaccinated and it's for my life. "
"5881550","5884010"," It's required to be vaccinated."
"5885130","5886550"," I haven't run into anything."
"5886690","5887950"," I'm assuming people say that they do. "
"5888190","5894010"," I'm not, I don't think that they don't, but, um, at least in my experience."
"5894710","5896990"," Uh, it's been very, very good to be vaccinated."
"5903420","5904620"," Mr. Two biscuit. "
"5906060","5906920"," There's two men."
"5907980","5908660"," A hundred percent."
"5910280","5912000"," Uh, tap. "
"5912220","5914200"," Where is it even going with Quiddity above?"
"5915280","5917880"," Um, where is even going with the Quiddity above?"
"5918420","5920880"," I'm looking for a five minute check back over here."
"5921860","5925380"," Uh, not in a trade right now."
"5925920","5933480"," Uh, I'd like to see some kind of pullback down here and more and more run to, um, this 472"
"5933480","5934580"," and likely 475. "
"5934960","5936360"," Now look at the gamma profile."
"5937320","5941240"," Uh, whether that's today or tomorrow, I don't know, but I am bullish here."
"5942100","5945300"," Uh, or at least, uh, this is to chase at least. "
"5945540","5946420"," I'm bullish still here, man."
"5946980","5948720"," I didn't, I need to see a cross dude."
"5949260","5952800"," I need to see something like this to not be bullish here. "
"5953040","5958420"," Something like, um, you know, the usual suspect, right?"
"5958420","5959880"," Something like that."
"5960800","5963860"," And then have price come down and actually break below."
"5964680","5966620"," Start that nonsense to go to the downside. "
"5968420","5969960"," I don't expect any weakness."
"5970200","5974760"," Maybe a, maybe a small liquidation break and then the V shape is what I'm expecting."
"5975840","5983640"," It's only 11 a.m. So we'll see if we can catch that. "
"5996990","6004230"," Yeah, I don't, um, like, uh, I don't know if I'm, um, let me be clear on this, um, on"
"6004230","6005190"," vaccines, right?"
"6005750","6011750"," Uh, my only this, there's a couple of things with vaccines, uh, for at least my perspective."
"6013210","6017990"," I don't care if you get vaccinated in life or if you don't get vaccinated in life."
"6018490","6026610"," Um, I know that for a lot of things in my life, I've been required to show a vaccine card. "
"6027090","6031230"," Uh, those vaccines are different depending upon what I've been asked for."
"6031230","6033990"," As a matter of fact, I had to carry a vaccine card around with me."
"6035470","6038110"," Into my mid thirties. "
"6038890","6042570"," Uh, you guys may or may not know this, but like the, your kid, they give you a vaccine car."
"6042670","6043290"," I don't think they do that anymore."
"6043750","6048210"," I think, yeah, we have a vaccine card for my kids, but, um, for them, my kids to go places"
"6048210","6051810"," for me to go places, do things and roll and things need to be vaccinated. "
"6052710","6055490"," Um, I realize that some people are not going to get vaccinated."
"6055490","6060730"," Uh, I also realize that there can be side effects to vaccinations, realize people don't want to get"
"6060730","6061090"," vaccinated."
"6061410","6066050"," If you don't want to understand the only thing that I concern that I have with vaccines that I can"
"6066050","6068970"," relate to is that I'm a little bit older. "
"6069530","6076730"," Um, and I know from my childhood that, uh, I remember people that were still alive."
"6077410","6081130"," Uh, that were vaccinated in a time when people died in mass."
"6081650","6083750"," Uh, polio would be one to think about. "
"6083750","6085750"," Um, an easy one."
"6086110","6091270"," Um, when I was a kid, there were still a lot of people that suffered from polio that were still"
"6091270","6091630"," alive."
"6092150","6094290"," And I'm not so many people today, but when I was a kid, there still were. "
"6094890","6097910"," Um, there's still people that had physical deformities from polio."
"6099050","6104410"," Um, and one thing I'm saying about polio is, or anything like that is, uh, vaccines have changed."
"6105270","6106970"," Uh, this world for the better. "
"6106970","6114570"," Uh, the other thing I would say about vaccines is that you guys know the dark forest concept of"
"6114570","6115230"," vaccines is."
"6115850","6119930"," Um, you can see resurgence from, uh, disease."
"6121470","6127010"," Uh, introduced itself back into society through this dark forest that people that are unvaccinated"
"6127010","6130430"," will introduce the disease and will weave itself into a society. "
"6130970","6132350"," That's a concern to me as well."
"6133310","6135190"," Um, and to be honest."
"6135190","6139310"," Uh, now this vaccine, uh, COVID, right?"
"6139510","6143230"," GEDAD Gold is saying something about, uh, it's a dirty vaccine, that kind of stuff. "
"6143810","6150770"," I realize that there's going to be, uh, there's going to be, uh, issues, right?"
"6150950","6153270"," It's not going to be, it's not going to be a clean cut bumpy road."
"6153690","6156950"," There'll be a bumpy road along the way, but for the greater good of humanity."
"6157890","6160770"," Um, I believe in that vaccine, 100%. "
"6161350","6164910"," Uh, I, I want to bring this guy on sometime."
"6165370","6166990"," One of my best friends name is Chris."
"6167470","6169070"," Chris are, I'm not going to play his last name. "
"6169590","6172090"," It's a close friend of mine, a close friend of mine for years."
"6172770","6177030"," Uh, this guy is like a fucking doctor of, uh, I don't know, something would do with respiratory"
"6177030","6178190"," medicine or some shit."
"6179410","6181450"," And, uh, this guy went from New York. "
"6181550","6183230"," This is my closest friends in life."
"6183490","6183830"," Known this guy."
"6183970","6184730"," I've skied with him for years. "
"6185190","6186250"," Uh, fought with him for years."
"6186730","6187930"," Oh, we used to have made shit together."
"6187930","6192590"," Known this guy for fucking, matter of fact, one of his best friends is Olympic or gold medal"
"6192590","6193210"," Olympian. "
"6193610","6195730"," And, uh, for boxing, right?"
"6195950","6198430"," I used to hang out with these guys, uh, live next door to each other."
"6198430","6198930"," It was awesome."
"6199890","6203030"," This guy saw more fucking death, uh, from COVID, man. "
"6203590","6205530"," It was unfucking real."
"6206110","6209330"," Uh, so whatever they're doing, I'll, I'll take part in that."
"6209510","6210610"," That's my own personal thing. "
"6210690","6211450"," I'll take part in that."
"6211950","6217150"," Now, if you don't want to do that stuff, I'm not telling you, you have to get vaccinated for COVID"
"6217150","6217910"," or anything else."
"6217910","6218870"," Or any of that kind of stuff. "
"6219150","6220370"," I realize you're American."
"6220370","6221410"," You can do whatever you want."
"6222050","6226150"," Um, so please don't take anything that I say as, uh, fuck you. "
"6226290","6226650"," You're wrong."
"6226750","6227450"," That kind of stuff."
"6227790","6230310"," I can only tell you from my experience what I've gone through. "
"6230530","6233850"," I can only tell you, um, what I'm doing for myself."
"6234570","6236730"," Uh, my wife, my kids, all that kind of stuff."
"6237170","6238450"," And how we handle that stuff. "
"6239530","6245110"," Uh, so please don't take me as a, or that I'm ever like saying you're a bad person, but I"
"6245110","6245830"," can't get vaccinated."
"6245830","6250910"," Or you think this or that or whatever, you know, I just know what my experience has been."
"6251130","6252770"," And hey, anthrax to me. "
"6253150","6254350"," I did not want that shot."
"6255110","6255570"," I did not."
"6255910","6256490"," It was shots. "
"6257190","6257350"," Say."
"6258170","6260190"," Um, but I didn't want to get that vaccine personally."
"6260410","6263890"," So I understand the feeling of not wanting to be vaccinated, especially on proven shit. "
"6269330","6270450"," Hey, Bob, how are you doing?"
"6272950","6273770"," Yeah, I get that."
"6273990","6275650"," I understand the, um, I understand."
"6275990","6276550"," I understand it. "
"6277250","6278690"," Uh, who said that?"
"6278690","6282770"," Uh, good night, uh, B said people no longer trust the governor of the farmer companies."
"6283070","6284310"," I understand that a hundred percent."
"6284550","6285290"," And I don't either. "
"6285730","6287010"," And I don't like that."
"6287210","6289690"," There's one of the, you guys know this, right?"
"6289870","6294350"," Like, so doctors when they go to school, uh, they go from, uh, I don't know what's called, but it's"
"6294350","6295010"," like a methodology."
"6295830","6301270"," Uh, either fix something with medicine or you fix something with like operations and shit. "
"6301850","6305530"," I figured that's called, but it was like two or three different, uh, Hippocratic oath."
"6305530","6309990"," So not part of Hippocratic oath or it's part of like a thesis behind medical school."
"6310090","6312090"," Maybe someone that's a doctor here can chime in on that. "
"6312910","6316890"," Um, but a lot of things today are treatments, right?"
"6317430","6317670"," Right?"
"6317890","6318710"," That angers me, right?"
"6319170","6320410"," But we're not going to cure something."
"6320410","6321310"," We're going to treat it."
"6321770","6322170"," Right?"
"6322350","6323650"," The monetization of medicine. "
"6324270","6325990"," Uh, let's take a place that irks me too."
"6325990","6327310"," That drives me fucking bananas."
"6327510","6327830"," Right?"
"6328650","6329870"," Uh, we're not going to cure this shit. "
"6330010","6332530"," We're going to make you take a fucking pill every day."
"6332530","6332750"," That's right."
"6333130","6337890"," You guys know like there's a, so AIDS is a treatment now where you'll be like a low count. "
"6338750","6343410"," Um, of having the virus in your system now to where you can live a normal life."
"6343550","6343910"," But guess what?"
"6344070","6344970"," You got to take a goddamn pill."
"6345110","6346470"," I think, I think it's every day. "
"6346610","6347890"," Uh, once or twice a day."
"6348450","6350690"," I got that stuff drives me fucking bad."
"6350830","6350950"," Right?"
"6351230","6353510"," The monetization of medicine and that respect. "
"6353690","6354830"," So I'm with you on that stuff too."
"6355250","6357750"," Uh, I don't think a lot of people disagree in this stuff."
"6358790","6362450"," Uh, I think it comes down to like, yeah, let's fight about it or something. "
"6362450","6363030"," I'm shit like that."
"6363210","6367750"," I don't think, I don't think a pro vaccination people are in disagreement with that stuff."
"6368150","6368630"," That's my point. "
"6369070","6369970"," I'm not disagreeing with that stuff."
"6370770","6374250"," Um, so, but I don't think we're farther away than you think."
"6374510","6375490"," This is a matter of choice. "
"6375510","6375870"," Right?"
"6376550","6377230"," What are you going to do?"
"6377350","6378050"," What are you not going to do?"
"6385220","6387660"," Oh, yeah, that's the, uh, bork's talking about the preventative."
"6387860","6389020"," I think that's the same drug."
"6389600","6390620"," Am I wrong on that bork?"
"6391160","6393960"," So I think that drug is a lower dose for prevention. "
"6394740","6397560"," Uh, for unprotected sex for young people, right?"
"6397680","6398640"," Or I say young people."
"6399120","6400480"," He has for people in general."
"6401060","6404380"," That I've unprotected sex with higher and high risk populations or whatever. "
"6406260","6407180"," Yeah, it's the same."
"6407300","6408160"," It's the lower lower dose."
"6409000","6409840"," That's what I think it was. "
"6410080","6412700"," It's just lower dose helps prevent you from catching."
"6413560","6414700"," Uh, HIV."
"6416900","6422880"," But, you know, uh, don't always think that everybody's a bad point here on the vaccine stuff is. "
"6423660","6427360"," Uh, oftentimes you're closer in what your thoughts are."
"6427580","6429100"," And then your decision making is different."
"6429840","6432140"," Um, you know, you can let that slide. "
"6432380","6434780"," Somebody's taken a vaccine or somebody's not taken a vaccine."
"6434780","6435740"," It's to each his own."
"6436260","6438260"," Uh, at least in our country it is, right?"
"6445030","6447130"," Too much panic bear trap on Friday. "
"6448730","6451370"," Um, too much panic bear trap on Friday."
"6452630","6454890"," Uh, now I think you guys were."
"6454890","6457350"," I told you guys, right?"
"6457570","6458190"," Try it up, right?"
"6458510","6458930"," On Friday. "
"6459090","6459870"," I think it said that on Twitter."
"6460190","6461010"," I buy the dip here."
"6461770","6463370"," It's just how long do you buy the dip?"
"6464250","6465930"," Let's look at it from this perspective here. "
"6466070","6466210"," Okay."
"6466730","6467830"," Until we break this range."
"6468610","6469450"," We can simplify it. "
"6469630","6471110"," Our traditional chart is out there."
"6472290","6475470"," Uh, Elliott wavers to probably will know this count too, right?"
"6476090","6477110"," Uh, let's see."
"6481210","6482570"," Keep it simple here. "
"6483990","6485030"," Pretty simple, right?"
"6486490","6487850"," Not rocket science, right?"
"6490250","6492870"," Just sitting in a nice little, nice little trend right here."
"6492950","6493350"," You see that right?"
"6493490","6494570"," Big old giant bull flag."
"6494610","6496990"," One, two, three, four. "
"6497250","6497390"," Right there."
"6497470","6497850"," You got one."
"6499390","6499490"," Two. "
"6500910","6502390"," And three down there, right?"
"6503850","6504910"," She got a nice rip higher."
"6505770","6507150"," Bulls can't give this up over here."
"6507250","6508410"," If they do, you know what happens, right?"
"6509650","6510570"," The bloodbath downside, right?"
"6510570","6512630"," So this is where I'd be concerned. "
"6513250","6514810"," You're a bull be concerned down here."
"6515390","6517270"," Uh, I do expect us to roll up here."
"6517930","6519150"," So we're not there yet, are we?"
"6519350","6520210"," We're not quite there yet. "
"6520270","6521170"," Where are we right now?"
"6521270","6521790"," Let's see where we are."
"6523630","6524190"," Hey, look."
"6530990","6532010"," They're about there, right?"
"6536730","6539490"," Solidate down here, grind up, down here, grind up, right?"
"6539630","6540710"," There's your roll over there. "
"6541610","6542810"," That's the 17th, right?"
"6544050","6548550"," Maybe it's before, if we can get up, price-wise, at least, squeeze up as high as possible."
"6549470","6552750"," If you're looking for that roll, you already know what to look for, right?"
"6553550","6555390"," Your hourly trigger is down here at the pivot."
"6556710","6557110"," 468. "
"6558170","6564160"," So unless you break that 468, let's look at it right here, right?"
"6565120","6565820"," So here's that pivot."
"6567260","6567660"," Right?"
"6569000","6570920"," There's your previous low, if you're a bear."
"6572300","6577480"," That's at 466.05. And we know that bad things come below 462. "
"6579020","6580640"," That's 464 right there."
"6580820","6586380"," So this S3 down here is kind of the magic sauce for the bears, right?"
"6587740","6589540"," You don't want to be down here."
"6593190","6594450"," You don't want to be down here. "
"6594610","6595630"," I'll doom it and gloom in."
"6595990","6597870"," And we bounce at that 462, right?"
"6598510","6600370"," Start heading higher right there as well."
"6600610","6602670"," And you're still on trend here to the upside. "
"6603370","6605950"," So if you're a bear, you're looking for the squeeze higher."
"6606590","6607390"," Take that down."
"6608110","6609130"," Jump back in underneath. "
"6609910","6610310"," Right?"
"6610450","6611210"," Take your money and run."
"6611730","6614170"," Otherwise, let these fucking bulls do what they're doing up here."
"6614850","6618670"," If you are a bull and you're bullish, you're like, Cap, we're not actually ever coming down. "
"6618850","6619750"," You know what you need to do, right?"
"6620470","6622010"," You need to get above here."
"6622750","6624850"," Consolidate and start to break this one right here."
"6624990","6625910"," Come back down and get above. "
"6626590","6627670"," You can start type of higher highs."
"6630370","6631270"," Fairly simple here."
"6639150","6642870"," Protect your trade from macro headline risk with financial use price. "
"6642870","6646630"," Now only $99 a year for our real time service."
"6649010","6659730"," A trailer"
"6659730","6660170"," podcast."
"6660530","6661350"," What's going on, brother?"
"6662050","6662710"," Good to see you, man. "
"6663050","6663650"," Happy New Year, brother."
"6668410","6669770"," What's going on?"
"6675630","6676630"," Happy New Year, man."
"6679090","6680230"," P.I.B. Crypto. "
"6680390","6680790"," How are you doing?"
"6687490","6690810"," Oh, Chase just said the shorts on January 17th."
"6691790","6692650"," I just showed you that, right?"
"6692650","6694830"," I showed you the 17th over there."
"6695650","6701710"," If we go in that same direction, it does look like the 17th, or price, Chase. "
"6702110","6702610"," It's one of the other."
"6702770","6704410"," It's price or time."
"6705410","6706090"," Hey, buddy. "
"6707110","6711170"," It's either $4.75 or the 17th, bro."
"6716570","6719330"," So Ian is saying D.O. versus MD."
"6719690","6723350"," Some doctors of osteopathic medicine use medicine as part of treatment. "
"6724210","6726350"," MD is more process-focused surgical."
"6726810","6728210"," Thanks Ian for chiming in on that, brother."
"6729010","6729570"," Appreciate it, man. "
"6731430","6732690"," More in Abraham, how are you?"
"6732850","6733290"," Good to see you."
"6737560","6739100"," Yeah, you can't short this right now."
"6739580","6741300"," Chase, do not short this, man. "
"6743040","6746840"," Even if it rolls down, they're likely going to buy that hourly trigger and keep sending it grinding"
"6746840","6747240"," at higher."
"6747500","6748520"," You got to break that hourly trigger."
"6750560","6754260"," You're about to see your dentist that went to get a crown, and his drill was busted and it gave"
"6754260","6755560"," me a third degree burn in the South. "
"6755940","6756640"," Dude, what?"
"6758220","6759280"," Are you serious, bro?"
"6764720","6767700"," Can you explain the concept of correction through time?"
"6768860","6772760"," Do you mean, are you relating this to what I'm saying to time or price?"
"6773440","6774540"," Is that what you mean by that?"
"6779700","6781880"," Dude, that's, dude, show me a picture, dude."
"6782040","6783340"," Send me a, give me a picture, dude."
"6783780","6784360"," I want to see it. "
"6785180","6786960"," I got some dent to work coming up to, man."
"6787320","6788620"," I'm like spooked right now."
"6788920","6789980"," Like, oh, I don't want to do this. "
"6793770","6794810"," I hate the dent."
"6794970","6796430"," I go to the dentist, but I can't stop."
"6796550","6797170"," I got great teeth. "
"6797650","6802890"," Everything is good on my teeth and stuff, but I'm getting older and I'm like, I think I have a"
"6802890","6804090"," root canal coming in my future."
"6804090","6804850"," Normally, you get older."
"6805130","6806970"," They're like, yeah, it's been 10 years, buddy. "
"6807590","6808810"," Time for a fucking root canal."
"6809830","6810990"," That's what I keep being told."
"6811790","6813270"," I'm just hoping that ain't going to happen. "
"6818040","6818360"," Yeah."
"6818720","6819620"," So, okay."
"6819620","6826120"," So, Jay Pastor asked about a time or so like corrective behavior, time or price, right?"
"6827880","6834540"," So, my point here would be, normally, like, so normally, let's say we get bearish or bullish. "
"6835160","6836180"," I don't care if it's bearish or bullish."
"6836460","6837080"," Doesn't matter, right?"
"6837660","6841640"," If we have a confirmation that we're going to go up or down from, let's say, the hourly trigger."
"6842240","6845120"," Say price confirms underneath the hourly trigger. "
"6846020","6849200"," We have a target, a price target below."
"6849200","6849740"," Right?"
"6850220","6857620"," So, let's say, let's say price is at $100 and we have a bearish cross, a price cross below the"
"6857620","6858600"," hourly trigger, right?"
"6859340","6862080"," We confirm that the move is going to be down, right?"
"6862280","6863420"," Back check the hourly trigger."
"6864040","6866100"," And let's say our price target is $90. "
"6867300","6871300"," We can hit that $90 either in one day or a week."
"6872060","6880440"," We can, when we're looking for that price target, the key point is that the time frame matters."
"6880860","6889100"," So, if you have a price getting below a one in five minutes, you have a price target that is"
"6889100","6891300"," just for that intraday trading. "
"6892360","6894400"," So, you're not expecting as much, right?"
"6895300","6898340"," So, you're like, I'm bearish here for the next intraday."
"6898980","6903860"," If you see price get below an hourly trigger, I'm bearish for one to five days."
"6904460","6909760"," If we see a cross of price with the hourly and the daily trigger to the downside, I would expect"
"6909760","6918260"," one to three weeks, possibly even four weeks of downside or the price targets for that time frame. "
"6918680","6924460"," So, that's what I mean by that is how long should we be bearish?"
"6924780","6931400"," It's either gonna be 30 points straight to hell or it's gonna take a week to staircase down or up"
"6931400","6932240"," to that price."
"6933460","6943650"," So, I was just looking at, as an example, I was just looking at a 30 minute chart here, right?"
"6943790","6944470"," Here's a 30 minute chart."
"6945530","6947670"," And if we just continue going up here, right?"
"6948390","6952690"," Up, up, up, up, up, up, right?"
"6953430","6955010"," This is the 17th right here. "
"6955510","6957990"," It's the 17th of January, okay?"
"6959150","6961630"," So, time or price, okay?"
"6961630","6969670"," So, either we're going to take until the 17th to get to 475, right?"
"6970890","6979310"," Or if we crank up and just blast off and hit that 475 today, tomorrow, next day, Thursday."
"6980110","6989010"," If we get there before, the 475 before time that we've given ourselves, I'm still a seller here."
"6990970","6993350"," Still a seller here, still a seller here. "
"6993610","6994890"," I don't care when we get there."
"6995370","6996910"," It's either price or time."
"6997810","7006390"," So, time for that corrective behavior to take place or price, one or the other, right?"
"7006830","7007870"," Okay, one or the other. "
"7008410","7012410"," So, I'm not relying upon all this traditional goofy chart and all that kind of stuff, right?"
"7012610","7013550"," No guarantees on that."
"7014830","7019470"," If we blast up here today, then, you know, I'm going to be trying to be a seller over here"
"7019930","7022210"," and look for that next blast down over here."
"7026090","7026810"," Good question. "
"7041710","7043610"," Hey, you texted me, okay, try to podcast."
"7044750","7048870"," Yeah, we can, let me look on the, hold on one second, man."
"7048990","7049710"," Look at, you want to look at snow?"
"7051710","7052910"," Yeah, look at snow, hold on. "
"7060240","7068430"," Someone else is asking, anyway, YouTube, if you could answer this, someone's asking, has anybody"
"7068430","7070850"," had any good experiences with Obamacare?"
"7072330","7073990"," I don't have an answer to that."
"7077190","7079490"," I don't know if it's been good or not."
"7079950","7081290"," That shit frustrates me too. "
"7085390","7091010"," I'm one of the believers in, I'm one of those, I'm one of the, I'm one of the Democrats who"
"7091010","7096070"," probably don't like, but I'm like a capitalist Democrat."
"7097510","7099010"," I'm a really fucked up Democrat."
"7099370","7105010"," I'm like a, I want to say I'm an old school Democrat, like the 50s and 60s, to some extent,"
"7105310","7109810"," but I believe in a universal healthcare, 100%. "
"7111630","7113870"," I'm a believer in universal healthcare."
"7114430","7115450"," I like my fire departments."
"7115830","7116450"," I like my police. "
"7117070","7121110"," Well, I don't like the police right now, but I wish, or I shouldn't say that either."
"7121110","7125870"," I don't like our, our, our, our, um, justice system."
"7125890","7127650"," I want it to be more productive. "
"7128630","7134010"," Of course, I want to see rehabilitation for people, not just, I think some people, yeah, you just"
"7134010","7136790"," fucking throw away the key or do whatever you need to do."
"7136830","7140410"," There are some right cases for that, but then I think a judicial system is all fucked up."
"7140790","7142890"," All right, so I should say our justice system. "
"7144450","7147390"," Of course, police have to live in that system that we've created."
"7148330","7150030"," But then healthcare, same fucking thing."
"7150230","7153170"," Like healthcare, I'm like, there's no reason. "
"7153870","7155110"," We're the best cut in my view."
"7155310","7157070"," We're the best goddamn country in the entire world."
"7158170","7163770"," We suck at a lot of things, but it's glaring to me that we don't have universal healthcare. "
"7164010","7164930"," It's the best in the world."
"7165330","7168470"," Like we don't like, if there's anyone that could do it, it's probably us."
"7169210","7176010"," Like take the best of, um, take the best of the, uh, Scandinavian country is the best of Japan and"
"7176010","7176950"," try to create something. "
"7178990","7181210"," It's the, it's bizarre that we don't have that in this country."
"7181450","7183210"," We were the best, best goddamn country in the world."
"7183350","7184210"," I'm not going to lie to you. "
"7185070","7185730"," That's my view."
"7186070","7188150"," We suck at a guy still say this a little earlier."
"7188290","7189150"," We suck at a lot of stuff. "
"7189570","7190850"," You always live up to be in that."
"7191550","7193750"," I feel like we stagnated in that too, right?"
"7194450","7200690"," There's like a great American, like we were like, we were like, making great progress for a long,"
"7200770","7201690"," long time, right?"
"7201950","7203170"," We're into the sixties and stuff."
"7203370","7207290"," Some, some one in the seventies, like women's, women's live, all kinds of cool shit. "
"7207890","7211290"," Um, voting rights for women back in the early 1900s, that kind of stuff."
"7211550","7216230"," And like we don't, we haven't had that moment as Americans to be like, to do something really cool."
"7218470","7224690"," And I realize there's free healthcare for emergency room and that Medicare and Medicaid is kind of"
"7224690","7226370"," a fail safe for everybody out there. "
"7226370","7228870"," We have that built in to an extent in this country."
"7229370","7233110"," But I am like, yeah, we need like, if anybody could do healthcare, right?"
"7233230","7233890"," It's got to be us."
"7237870","7241510"," Yeah, I'm two, I believe, like here's, I'm a bizarre Democrat. "
"7242090","7243070"," It's like I'm two, right?"
"7243430","7245090"," I think you should be able to own a gun and stuff like that."
"7245230","7250630"," But then, you know, like, are we institutionalized people with mental health issues?"
"7250910","7251610"," We don't do that anymore."
"7251970","7254850"," Those institutions sucked too, right?"
"7255090","7256670"," But we used to, we used to believe it or not. "
"7256670","7260290"," There was a time when you lock people up that needed mental health care, right?"
"7260650","7261350"," We don't do that anymore."
"7261770","7264050"," We should do that in a better way."
"7264910","7267910"," But then I'm too, but I don't agree with gun culture. "
"7268410","7269710"," I think gun culture is disgusting."
"7270350","7271430"," I'm offended by it."
"7272550","7274590"," I wasn't raised with gun culture. "
"7274730","7275730"," I was raised with owning a gun."
"7276390","7281790"," My family uses weapons for, they own a ranch and stuff."
"7282090","7286290"," It's normal to have a gun, but we don't have gun culture in our family. "
"7287150","7288370"," In any way, shape or form."
"7288490","7289370"," It's more of a tool than anything."
"7289750","7290670"," There's a lot of respect there. "
"7291230","7293590"," Like that, it was like a weird change in gun culture."
"7293750","7295210"," I'm not down with that at all."
"7296750","7299470"," I have a real, very snobby opinion of people that have that. "
"7299630","7300710"," I didn't realize that you do."
"7300870","7301430"," You might want it."
"7301890","7304430"," You might want your cute pink gun and stuff. "
"7305210","7308810"," You know, your M4 or whatever it is, your M4 knockoff."
"7312250","7313790"," But I'm not that guy."
"7314350","7316790"," You look at it as more of a functional tool. "
"7316790","7317290"," That's it."
"7317570","7318810"," Not something that I'm like."
"7319830","7320650"," Something to hunt with. "
"7320810","7321610"," I'm a pro-hunter."
"7322050","7323690"," But then again, I'm a pro-hunter where you eat everything."
"7324150","7325070"," You know, you eat all that shit. "
"7325630","7326590"," You eat everything that you harvest."
"7327830","7330730"," You're not just trying to hunt for hunting's sake."
"7331650","7334390"," Like the Sea of Orange I see hunting blows my mind. "
"7334730","7335670"," Bull hunters understand this."
"7336630","7338830"," Oftentimes, muzzle-load hunters understand that concept."
"7346110","7346510"," Yeah. "
"7347090","7347990"," I'm a weird Democrat."
"7347990","7349690"," I'm a really fucking weird Democrat."
"7350670","7351570"," Or at least today. "
"7351810","7352670"," Or at least that's..."
"7352670","7353970"," I don't know if I'm a weird Democrat."
"7354850","7359710"," I think it's more like what we're told in news and social media."
"7360050","7361150"," It's like built..."
"7361150","7365650"," Everything today is built for us to fucking strangle each other, right?"
"7366250","7370870"," I feel like a lot of stuff is built today to get us all angry at each other and shit"
"7370870","7371290"," like that. "
"7372150","7372850"," Kind of bizarre."
"7376430","7378430"," Yeah, it's the right too, right?"
"7378430","7379050"," I see it in both."
"7379250","7380490"," I see it in both right and left. "
"7382190","7386450"," It's like you have to be this and you have to be that and you have to be, you know..."
"7387390","7390010"," You can't take a lot of this shit to its conclusion, right?"
"7390190","7393130"," You know, you can't take like a Democrat to its conclusion."
"7393530","7394990"," You can't take a Republican to its conclusion."
"7395690","7396610"," You know what you wind up with. "
"7397110","7399590"," So you kind of have to be there like raining both sides in."
"7399930","7402810"," But then meanwhile in social media, they're like, well, what did I say this?"
"7403830","7404610"," Fucking ban them."
"7404610","7407110"," You know, disavow them. "
"7407190","7407890"," It can't be your family."
"7407890","7408670"," It can't be your friend."
"7409510","7415510"," And then of course some of that really far right and far left stuff does in fact, it's where you"
"7415510","7418110"," are fighting with people and you're like, I can't be that person's friend. "
"7418270","7419330"," I came out of a discussion with them."
"7419770","7421670"," And then there's this other erosion too."
"7422430","7425410"," This is when you get into a conversation about liberal arts. "
"7426590","7435270"," And this is where we have a whole generation, young generation of kids that are all taking shifting"
"7435270","7438910"," their schooling to maths and sciences and not liberal arts."
"7439550","7449750"," Liberal arts is a great background for arguing constructively with people, having patience, have"
"7449750","7451490"," discussion, open discussion, disagreements."
"7452310","7453350"," You're like, I don't agree with you. "
"7454130","7457590"," You know, that kind of stuff and not fucking want to murder somebody."
"7457590","7463250"," Like, that's the other like, you know, like just the pure like anger."
"7463750","7467770"," I noticed a little bit less of it past couple of family get togethers. "
"7467850","7475590"," I've noticed less of it, but last for pre COVID and then during COVID, I noticed it was really bad,"
"7475590","7477810"," like lots of infighting family friends."
"7478150","7478950"," You name it."
"7479030","7483010"," A lot of a lot of nasty and we're all plebs, right?"
"7483150","7483890"," You guys know that, right?"
"7484010","7484950"," We're all fucking plebs. "
"7485130","7486750"," You guys, none of us are rich and powerful."
"7486750","7489610"," You guys wouldn't be in this show if you were that rich and powerful."
"7490730","7492130"," We're the plebs, you know?"
"7492410","7495730"," I don't care if you make fucking 500,000 years still a fucking pleb. "
"7497510","7498810"," It's still a fucking pleb."
"7499010","7500350"," You're not rich and powerful."
"7500810","7502810"," They have very small group of people that are that. "
"7506570","7507630"," Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"7507790","7508230"," Let's talk about."
"7508350","7513750"," Yeah, it's tough. "
"7514870","7515650"," It's real tough."
"7515770","7516550"," It's only going to get worse."
"7517170","7518270"," There's this whole other thing. "
"7519310","7520070"," What was this?"
"7520410","7522370"," I don't know if this is the New York Times."
"7522750","7527310"," I was going to show you share this with you guys last week where there's a discussion going on"
"7527310","7534630"," about corporations and control of social media corporate corporate."
"7536330","7538570"," You have a nation states, right?"
"7539690","7544130"," That are always fighting for you and fighting against you and trying to create all kinds of shit. "
"7544470","7554450"," There's this whole other multinational corporations and what they want is"
"7554450","7562270"," not always what even a nation states nation states might not be intelligent enough to fight the"
"7562270","7568590"," rise of these corporations and where their loyalties and ultimatums lie, I guess."
"7572970","7574090"," Yeah, I agree with that too."
"7574310","7576350"," I just watched the adocracy again recently. "
"7577650","7578610"," Fucking a man."
"7579110","7580150"," Tell me that shit ain't real."
"7580710","7583070"," Like, I just watched it again and it scared the shit out of me. "
"7583130","7584470"," I was like, they weren't lying."
"7584670","7587610"," If you guys haven't rewatched it, try to rewatch it again."
"7587610","7588370"," Like, recent. "
"7588810","7590270"," Didn't rewash it in the past couple of years."
"7591150","7592510"," If you haven't watched it in 10, 20 years."
"7592610","7596090"," I think I watched it like 20 years ago when I don't know when it came out but I just"
"7596090","7597210"," recently rewatched it. "
"7597350","7598830"," That shit scared the fuck out of me."
"7599570","7600470"," It really did."
"7610450","7610810"," Yeah. "
"7611330","7611490"," Yeah."
"7612370","7613670"," Yeah, I go through rocket, uh, surgeon."
"7616260","7617960"," You have environmentally conservative too. "
"7618160","7620820"," Like, I don't like seeing, um, I don't like to see we're doing our environment."
"7620940","7622780"," Of course, I want to see, like, solutions to that shit."
"7623680","7625840"," Um, I don't know if that's the end of the world. "
"7625840","7628200"," But it's tragic to lose."
"7628400","7629920"," I want to lose open space."
"7630620","7634220"," Um, I don't want to lose, uh, fireflies and shit. "
"7634400","7635880"," I don't want to see the fucking ice caps melt."
"7636080","7637660"," I don't care if we were causing it or not."
"7638360","7641420"," Um, I want to work towards saving that shit if possible, right?"
"7644060","7645940"," Um, yeah, that's all bad shit. "
"7650390","7651170"," Good morning, David."
"7651370","7651750"," How are you, man?"
"7651970","7652450"," Good to see you brother."
"7652890","7653430"," Happy New Year, man. "
"7654030","7654870"," Hope I was well, brother."
"7660010","7663590"," Do you want to stay up to date with the latest and be on the bleeding edge of news?"
"7663670","7665070"," Yeah, there's like a payrolls."
"7665250","7671130"," Then sign up today and get our special offer or financial use pro for years worth our service for"
"7671130","7672390"," the price of one month. "
"7672670","7677850"," You know what I never, you know what I never, you know, I started using using recently was, um, the"
"7677850","7678730"," stop in clinics."
"7679430","7682450"," Like those, those are our clinics or whatever they have medical clinics."
"7682950","7684470"," They remind me of care in Japan. "
"7685530","7687470"," Uh, like, why do we not just have that?"
"7687470","7688310"," Something like that."
"7688810","7690790"," Uh, that, I find that bizarre."
"7691850","7695190"," But we don't have like a universal care that at least has the minute clinics or something. "
"7695850","7698770"," Uh, where a doctor can treat you quickly."
"7699270","7700770"," Like, hey, I got, I got this going on."
"7700870","7704510"," Is there a way for me to get some, some quick care on this or my leg is broken?"
"7704790","7705750"," Can you fucking give me a cast?"
"7707050","7708270"," Like I broke my leg. "
"7709030","7710010"," Can you fix it, please?"
"7711030","7714410"," If it's not something that requires like a hospital or a doctor or true doctor."
"7716010","7719310"," No, I don't know what those clinics are called, but I use them more frequently than I ever have."
"7719570","7720930"," Like, hey, I just need to come in for this right now. "
"7727190","7729110"," Yeah, prostitution and the war for profit of the tool."
"7729290","7732210"," This industry is getting really good at it right now."
"7736990","7738990"," Yeah, we need art and society to survive. "
"7739170","7740430"," I said we need food and water to survive."
"7740630","7741330"," We need art to thrive."
"7741530","7742070"," I grew with that man. "
"7742230","7744250"," A hundred percent."
"7745150","7746270"," I hope we don't lose that."
"7746890","7752340"," Um, nice. "
"7752800","7755160"," So David's going to, uh, he said happy to meet everybody."
"7755160","7757260"," He's saying he's going to take a flight down the Caribbean."
"7758100","7760380"," Hey, are you going to watch, uh, David, are you going to go see your mom?"
"7760920","7762220"," Is she everything okay?"
"7763640","7765560"," Yeah, like an, is that what they call urgent care?"
"7766780","7768940"," Uh, I love those places. "
"7770000","7771680"," Uh, I'm pretty active guy."
"7771860","7774080"," So I'll tell you what I use them for."
"7774280","7778420"," I get a cortisone shots every six months or so. "
"7778660","7780080"," I'll get a cortisone shot."
"7780080","7780940"," I'll go to one of those clinics."
"7781280","7784060"," It takes me 15 minutes, 20 minutes and they give me a shot. "
"7784640","7786620"," And I'm back to fucking hike and biking and skiing."
"7788140","7789040"," I like those places."
"7791020","7797000"," David, it wasn't there a big festival down the Caribbean just going on just now. "
"7797900","7799160"," What is that festival called?"
"7802760","7805160"," Just doing better right on, right on, right on."
"7807620","7809240"," David, what are your thoughts here, man?"
"7809600","7810360"," Let me ask you a question."
"7810360","7813780"," Um, David, you think we got one more roll coming?"
"7814540","7817480"," Like a, uh, like four 72 to 475. "
"7818060","7818920"," One more roll down."
"7819000","7820160"," They're going to try to send us lower."
"7821540","7822340"," Or not. "
"7828630","7830150"," Maybe David can answer that question."
"7834030","7836690"," Yeah, I didn't know Columbia just had a festival, didn't they?"
"7836970","7839430"," They have the black and white or something like that or I feel it's called."
"7840050","7843810"," I thought I saw some, uh, some carnivals going on part of all going on. "
"7847700","7848640"," Go ahead and Saturday."
"7849120","7849860"," I got you."
"7850320","7856920"," I wish I was going with you, David. "
"7857480","7861450"," I think that sounds like a blast, man."
"7861650","7862690"," Three weeks down the Caribbean."
"7863210","7863390"," Hmm. "
"7866400","7867620"," Sounds like fun times."
"7870410","7874670"," So David, I was looking to sell like 404 on queues."
"7876470","7878470"," 404, 405, maybe. "
"7879730","7884770"," 475 on spoons and I'm looking for these fucking sellers, man."
"7885590","7886430"," They want that."
"7886650","7889670"," They want, they want to break that 46 or 46 30. "
"7891770","7892950"," Hey, good to see you, Jaymore."
"7894850","7895910"," They came was great."
"7896090","7896570"," I needed it. "
"7897170","7897950"," I needed the recharge."
"7898690","7899170"," I was sick."
"7900130","7901090"," Uh, I was sick. "
"7901250","7901890"," I needed the recharge."
"7902210","7905450"," I needed time to, uh, do real research."
"7905450","7907810"," Like I need to get ready for the upcoming year. "
"7908350","7909950"," So I really needed that time."
"7910070","7914030"," I needed that time to focus on what do I expect for the year."
"7914030","7917810"," I needed like, it's almost like a sabbatical and it worked for me. "
"7917990","7918410"," I needed it."
"7922660","7928360"," Yeah, Joe Donut likes the DR. He likes the DR. I've never been to the DR. I want to go."
"7928560","7929060"," I've never been there. "
"7935170","7939310"," The Dark Ages had no art to speak of resulting in a very little documented record of the time."
"7939810","7941610"," 300 years pretty much lost to the void."
"7946470","7953150"," Uh, no, you'll know if it's a bear plane. "
"7953150","7958170"," So if you're looking for a bit, so all I'm looking for here, just a timeout to you guys here."
"7958570","7960430"," So there's been no five minute check back."
"7961730","7964190"," Since, uh, nine 30 this morning. "
"7965510","7967550"," So I'm just looking for a small check back here."
"7969450","7971610"," And then a progression to our two."
"7972530","7976090"," If we get a bear plane, I'll show you what the price action will look like. "
"7976270","7979610"," So if you're looking to go short here, I'm going to just, I'm going to draw it out for you"
"7979610","7979950"," right now."
"7979950","7980170"," Okay."
"7982870","7984310"," What you'd be looking for. "
"7985410","7985990"," Oh, let's see."
"7986070","7987150"," You get a failure here, right?"
"7988670","7990810"," They'd be looking for a push down here."
"7993620","7994580"," Something like this. "
"7996960","8002280"," And how that would look like here and when you would take the short, uh, you'd be waiting."
"8002640","8006220"," So you're going to be waiting for not that pullback there."
"8012110","8014530"," You're looking to enter that short only. "
"8017310","8017910"," Right there."
"8019970","8022370"," See, you don't want to be, you don't want to be early to it."
"8022430","8024010"," You don't be like, yeah, I'm fucking short here. "
"8024130","8024810"," Fuck these bulls."
"8025330","8026710"," Like when you, this goes for bears."
"8027070","8028330"," This goes for bulls and bears. "
"8028530","8029790"," Doesn't matter if you're a bull or a bear."
"8030610","8033070"," Care what's you could, this could flip this chart upside down."
"8033090","8034050"," It's the same fucking thing. "
"8035310","8035670"," Right."
"8035910","8041150"," So in this case, right, in this case, if it goes up, you're fucked, right?"
"8041290","8043030"," You're just, you're just getting your ass blasted here."
"8044210","8046210"," The meat of the trade is right there. "
"8046350","8047130"," That's where the money is."
"8047310","8048990"," And this is where you're most guaranteed."
"8050670","8051030"," Right. "
"8051190","8054230"," You get the, you get the blast down, the rejection on the five minute trigger."
"8054850","8057230"," Your target to the downside is then 468."
"8057730","8059630"," You take your money right here, believe it or not, too. "
"8059710","8060110"," You get out of there."
"8060170","8064350"," You get your money here and you wait for a break underneath in the one in five minute trigger to"
"8064350","8066170"," come down for the next leg to the downside."
"8066170","8073370"," So you need to be like a, like a, like a, like a surgeon for lack of a better word. "
"8073410","8075690"," There are some other ways to look for a topping action."
"8076010","8077150"," We'll show you that right now."
"8078430","8082210"," If we are topping here, take a look here, go to a 30 minute chart, right?"
"8082670","8083210"," 30 minute basis. "
"8086100","8087600"," That was a good pump for today."
"8088880","8090620"," But I'm looking for like plus 25."
"8091040","8094400"," I'm looking for this hourly to kind of be cranking up here. "
"8095040","8096840"," First pullback will be plus 25."
"8096840","8100360"," If we get the plus 50, we'd still get the pullback."
"8100580","8104720"," So we're right now, we're at plus 17 on bullishness. "
"8105020","8106820"," So I'm not necessarily bearish here."
"8107220","8108920"," We're getting bullish on the daily trigger."
"8108920","8110240"," So that's, that's good for the bulls. "
"8110680","8112760"," And we aren't that plus 25 yet on velocity."
"8113340","8115420"," So the daily on the hourly at least."
"8115720","8119480"," So right now, tentatively, just looking for a pullback. "
"8120560","8121680"," Looking to retest."
"8124870","8127950"," Looking to retest this five minute trigger down here and go higher."
"8128230","8129050"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"8129450","8134490"," Now, if we start to break underneath and the bulls can't recover, right?"
"8134730","8136850"," I'll start thinking about taking a short in here."
"8140210","8142310"," So I just looking for that pullback here."
"8142410","8143330"," Check that five minutes. "
"8143870","8144850"," See where we're at."
"8145090","8146090"," It's all I'm looking for here."
"8146290","8147550"," Just a little pullback here. "
"8164990","8165430"," Yeah."
"8165870","8167850"," So so David's making a very good point here."
"8168610","8170570"," Listen, I'm going to read to you what David said. "
"8170670","8170830"," Okay."
"8170830","8172410"," And I agree with this."
"8172650","8175910"," He's saying 4765 on ES is critical. "
"8176530","8178590"," 100% holding that number."
"8179150","8182990"," 100% above 4743."
"8183410","8183830"," I am bullish. "
"8185130","8186430"," I agree with you 100%."
"8186430","8188810"," You got to be up there and holding it 100% fucking percent."
"8190210","8192730"," Still still have to remain with upside for now. "
"8193049","8194629"," I'm not shorting till I get a set up."
"8194650","8196450"," So this is all the stuff I've been telling you this morning."
"8196950","8198190"," Same, same story. "
"8198490","8199170"," Another way of saying it."
"8199330","8199830"," Same story."
"8201370","8204549"," Do not try to pick a top upside targets are still open. "
"8204850","8205209"," Absolutely."
"8206370","8210129"," What I do not like on ES, we are not closing above Friday high for now."
"8210430","8211950"," I said that to you guys this morning. "
"8212170","8214030"," So David just said we didn't close above."
"8214370","8220770"," So you guys remember this morning when I showed you that Friday's high did not close higher than"
"8220770","8221629"," Thursday's high."
"8222209","8223969"," That left me with some concern, right?"
"8224889","8227010"," Same thing would apply today, right?"
"8227010","8229830"," So today's high should be higher than yesterday's eye. "
"8230270","8232290"," That shows productivity, right?"
"8232530","8233969"," Productive on the end of the day."
"8234190","8236709"," So I agree with those all those statements, David."
"8237270","8238010"," 100% brother. "
"8240650","8241750"," I love you, Shaq."
"8242070","8242950"," I love you Shaq Baker."
"8245750","8247250"," Thoughts on XLF I can give you. "
"8247370","8247809"," Oh, and snow."
"8248049","8249070"," We're going to do snow in XLF."
"8252930","8253910"," I'll look at Tesla too. "
"8254030","8255250"," Let's do a quick round the market."
"8255530","8255690"," Okay."
"8256129","8257190"," Let's take a quick look around the market. "
"8259370","8260170"," 30-minute chart."
"8261090","8262850"," We're going to switch over to a trigger screen."
"8263730","8265270"," We're going to pop in with XLF. "
"8270500","8272900"," Let's take a look at XLF and see what we can see."
"8279080","8282580"," Now what do we like to buy XLF down here in the lows on daily trigger?"
"8284920","8287059"," So right here a little bit of a dip on XLF."
"8291280","8292940"," Let me tell you one second. "
"8318680","8320820"," Yeah, that doesn't look good."
"8321580","8323719"," Positioning is short on XLF for a pullback."
"8324500","8327480"," We do have some buying on trend here all the way up. "
"8329299","8331799"," Not necessarily bearish though in XLF."
"8332620","8340860"," I would like to be above 3770 for XLF to explore like rotational to the downside."
"8341480","8350059"," This is not necessarily bullish, but at the same time that doesn't reflect as negatively on spy at"
"8350059","8350459"," the moment. "
"8351500","8354420"," We still are on trend right now in the 30-minute trigger."
"8355160","8359680"," We are losing velocity though on the daily trigger, so I am expecting weakness in spy at some"
"8359680","8359920"," point."
"8360580","8364160"," Just down here, a little bit of a bump here, but still lower highs all the way down. "
"8364940","8366980"," How does that translate to spoos?"
"8369280","8372940"," All XLF needs to do is kind of bounce around in here."
"8373559","8379020"," Until the roll comes, spy and cues could still trend higher though, even though that is taking"
"8379020","8379260"," place."
"8380000","8385540"," So overall, I am not too bullish on XLF, but at the same time that doesn't translate to spy"
"8385540","8386379"," crashing today. "
"8387200","8388400"," We are going to go back to spy really quick."
"8389960","8397940"," So let's say you see the rotation trade going into risk off and away from XLF to health, but you"
"8397940","8401340"," could still see this price go up before we get that roll down over here."
"8402600","8408360"," So I am not really taking that as an indicator at this point that is like right now at this"
"8408360","8412040"," moment because XLF is straight and sideways to expect that roll. "
"8412540","8417480"," I still expect that grind up on spy before we get the eventual roll to the downside."
"8417480","8425640"," But it does lend credence to the idea of either price or time saying short this to the downside."
"8426720","8428940"," It is showing that right now. "
"8429640","8430240"," Tesla."
"8431400","8432560"," Let's take a look at Tesla."
"8435650","8438350"," 30 minute chart right here, right on Tesla. "
"8440590","8442490"," Look at that right there."
"8443310","8446830"," So Tesla, let's have a look, see and see what we can see here."
"8447930","8451610"," So 30 minute chart on Tesla, you know what my thoughts are in Tesla, right?"
"8452350","8454010"," Tesla trades, that's daily velocity. "
"8454610","8454830"," That's it."
"8454990","8455530"," That's all trades."
"8455930","8456110"," Daily velocity. "
"8456450","8460510"," I mean, it does trade this hourly, but if you're trading Tesla, it's always daily value."
"8460730","8461330"," Your best trades."
"8461750","8462330"," Boom right there. "
"8463010","8463110"," Right."
"8463410","8464050"," Boom right there."
"8465410","8467630"," Always daily value on Tesla. "
"8467970","8470430"," So are we at negative velocity in Tesla?"
"8471270","8473770"," Well, we got a little peak to the downside right here."
"8473790","8474250"," Do you see it?"
"8474530","8475710"," A little tick down there."
"8475710","8478690"," It's a little tiny tick right there to the downside. "
"8479450","8483210"," We're losing velocity on Tesla on the daily."
"8483670","8486090"," What does that mean for you?"
"8486630","8493690"," My expectations here on Tesla would be that we trade up here, right?"
"8494130","8497270"," And we're going to get rejected to the downside over here."
"8497750","8500110"," This is also falls in line with spy. "
"8500710","8502090"," You get the upside here."
"8503070","8508250"," You get a fake out and a downside with 227, 67, and that's the actual dip buy."
"8508990","8515270"," This is also the place I want you to realize and know that this is also the place where CTAs"
"8515270","8517630"," are along the market to here. "
"8518250","8525930"," If we lose this here, CTAs will sell, will sell their holdings and we will blast down in a"
"8525930","8528810"," meaningful way in both Tesla and the market."
"8528810","8534470"," That would be the 46030 on SPX."
"8534730","8535730"," So just be aware of that. "
"8536330","8539050"," I would really like to see price get down here to this monthly."
"8540010","8546250"," Maybe break through briefly and see the daily velocity become negative 50 negative 25 somewhere in"
"8546250","8548390"," there to look for a dip to buy."
"8548550","8552270"," So me personally on Tesla, whatever bullishness you're seeing right now. "
"8553350","8559350"," And thus we prove differently unless we unless price like breaks up here starts to consolidate and"
"8559350","8561890"," then begins to move higher and break through this stuff right here."
"8562210","8570290"," I am ultimately bearish on Tesla down to 227 228 and then that's where that's where we're going to"
"8570290","8573750"," start fresh again on Tesla, something like that right there."
"8575450","8582790"," So in the in the interim bullish on Tesla, you don't want to be breaking these previous lows right"
"8582790","8583010"," here. "
"8583130","8585730"," This 234 stuff like that."
"8585790","8587870"," But ultimately I see Tesla going down to 227."
"8589570","8590130"," Snow. "
"8594210","8596310"," Let's take a look at snow here 30 minute chart."
"8596810","8602470"," I do want you to realize that snow is going to trade with the market to some extent."
"8603550","8607350"," Okay, so here's snow right here nice little pump up nice little pump higher. "
"8607350","8609690"," We're expecting some market weakness already."
"8610230","8615870"," We've got a monthly trigger that's bearish right bearish max bearish monthly trigger."
"8615890","8617690"," That's very positive, believe it or not. "
"8618010","8624150"," When you see this right here, this is actually bear our bullish that monthly trigger being max"
"8624150","8627230"," bearish means that we're having a turn and snow."
"8627910","8631250"," Okay, so that's good very productive saying that."
"8632450","8633810"," Saying that right. "
"8634470","8636310"," You see all this right here."
"8636970","8646790"," I'm still going to expect snow to come back down and possibly recheck this hourly trigger right"
"8646790","8648570"," do some consolidating in here."
"8649610","8654890"," Before it begins to make a real move constructive move higher something like that. "
"8654890","8660650"," Some kind of a pull back here a false not a false breakout, but more of like yeah, I'm super"
"8660650","8661030"," bullish."
"8661150","8661650"," Everything looks great."
"8661690","8662490"," Come back down. "
"8662670","8663710"," You're going to need the help."
"8664490","8673780"," You're going to need the help of the daily trigger the hourly trigger right you're going to need"
"8673780","8674420"," help here."
"8676660","8682900"," And you're going to need the hourly trigger to come up here right and pound pound pound and then"
"8682900","8684520"," you get your major squeeze here. "
"8685440","8689160"," Okay, then you'll end up getting your major squeeze you'll break above here."
"8690260","8693120"," Your daily will come back up you'll have a pull back over here."
"8693880","8698400"," To your daily and then you'll get a five trigger cluster that should. "
"8700000","8701680"," Should take you where."
"8706840","8710400"," Right up there the big bad boys."
"8711340","8712700"," Right up there. "
"8712700","8719840"," So you got a lot of work here do you see all this working here like hot sausage over here"
"8719840","8720600"," all working."
"8720780","8722180"," It's going to take some time."
"8722720","8723340"," I do expect. "
"8724000","8728980"," I do expect consult or what should I call it."
"8730020","8736960"," I'm going to expect volatility as this takes place, but for an alternate upside move at least that"
"8736960","8737180"," 260."
"8738560","8743500"," At least that 260 to 230 then 260 on snow. "
"8744180","8746940"," It's very bullish even though it's very bullish."
"8747060","8752960"," Look for major dip buys like by by by all in here on trend."
"8753560","8757140"," So I expect violence in here to get up here. "
"8757200","8758140"," It's not going to be easy."
"8759000","8763660"," So snow starts setting some alerts you can even you can take this chart right here."
"8763660","8768660"," Snip it at home and as long as you stay on that trend right there. "
"8770200","8771360"," Right there right."
"8772020","8773600"," You're just looking to buy every dip."
"8773880","8776360"," Don't come on my show crying and be like all cup. "
"8776600","8777560"," It's doom and gloom."
"8777760","8778520"," You said I was going up."
"8778760","8779940"," It's going to be violence. "
"8780840","8783240"," And then you're going to get that explosive move to the upside."
"8783620","8784540"," If we break trend."
"8785440","8786320"," Trade dead. "
"8787280","8790640"," I mean like break trend and reject trend trade is dead."
"8790640","8793880"," You need to stand that trend the entire way for that upside move."
"8794440","8796100"," I am ultimately bullish on. "
"8797840","8798860"," Yeah, I'm bullish."
"8799220","8800800"," This is all very bullish down here."
"8801500","8805980"," So I am bullish on ultimately bullish on snow. "
"8809020","8812820"," Ultimately, yeah, bullish, but like would not be shocked to see."
"8814380","8820020"," The shit like that right there would not be shocked to see that would not be shocked to see a"
"8820020","8821760"," pullback all the way to 171."
"8822940","8824340"," Are you okay with that?"
"8824520","8825380"," Can you handle this?"
"8825500","8827760"," Is your trade set up handling that?"
"8828040","8833260"," If it isn't, if you're positioned wrong, make sure you're a buyer down here and not a fucking buyer"
"8833260","8833920"," right here. "
"8834900","8835740"," Hopefully that helps."
"8837220","8842160"," Can you handle a trip to 171 and then all the way to fuck back up to 228 is my"
"8842160","8844300"," question to you."
"8845860","8847440"," If you're not positioned appropriately. "
"8848720","8853360"," If you're not positioned appropriately for that to possibly happen, you're in the wrong side of the"
"8853360","8853600"," trade."
"8867010","8868310"," Just grinding right now."
"8870430","8871770"," Just waiting on a pullback. "
"8872010","8872370"," Come on."
"8872470","8873630"," Give me a pullback to the five minute trigger."
"8873970","8876730"," Please, please, please give me a pullback to the five minute trigger. "
"8884420","8885640"," Yeah, you're a good trader podcast."
"8886520","8887560"," If you got spreads, you're good."
"8888560","8889000"," That's fine, man. "
"8889220","8890240"," It's a good, good way to do it."
"8890700","8891940"," Don't panic if you get out of 171."
"8892680","8893540"," Just hang tight. "
"8897340","8899140"," I got to stretch my neck here."
"8899480","8900200"," Give me like five minutes."
"8900280","8901180"," Guys, a quick five minute break. "
"8903080","8904020"," Quick five minute break."
"8907530","8908230"," Where are you, Rome?"
"8908390","8909550"," I hope that answered the question for you."
"8910510","8910890"," Thanks, Steve. "
"8911010","8911810"," I appreciate it, brother."
"8915760","8916160"," CDNA."
"8922210","8923110"," All right, I'm right back. "
"8923250","8923750"," Give me five minutes."
"9380800","9382260"," It's going to stop in really quick."
"9383200","9386120"," This is the first yellow line right here. "
"9386780","9388060"," This is the first little trouble zone."
"9388400","9389300"," I'm going to delete that now."
"9390280","9391500"," You got one more up here. "
"9392360","9394400"," I'm going to break through this one right here."
"9411610","9412250"," Excuse me."
"9412930","9414730"," If you want me to say I just got to drink some water here. "
"9673030","9676870"," Protect your trade from macro headline risk with financial use pro."

"10291540","10294540"," All right, so I've got good news and bad news. "
"10296080","10297420"," I have to go to a meeting."
"10299180","10303900"," I do have to go to a meeting because we're launching this website and I don't have a choice."
"10305720","10307760"," I have to make some decisions. "
"10308220","10309440"," I was told that to make some decisions."
"10311380","10313140"," Just now, about five minutes ago."
"10313340","10315680"," It was going to come back here earlier, but then I got tied up in a call. "
"10315920","10317600"," So I have to go make some decisions."
"10319560","10320840"," I don't know how long it's going to take."
"10320840","10324780"," It could take like 15 minutes or half an hour or three fucking hours. "
"10324940","10325940"," I don't know how long it's going to take."
"10329320","10332200"," So this is what I'm going to say to you."
"10333760","10335180"," I will be here in the office. "
"10335640","10336920"," So if anything crazy happens."
"10338300","10341380"," I will jump on and be like, Hey, watch out for this or that or whatever."
"10342520","10344140"," Now for right now. "
"10344740","10350420"," Remember, we talked about time or price either or time or price, right?"
"10352060","10355380"," It is now 12 17 in the afternoon, right?"
"10355620","10358840"," We know that at 1 30 in the afternoon comes the fuckery, right?"
"10359440","10360880"," We have mid afternoon fuckery."
"10361780","10363500"," We also know about turnaround Tuesday."
"10364200","10366080"," We have a full week this week, right?"
"10366300","10367280"," We have full five days. "
"10368620","10373820"," But we have 1 30 the fuckery and then Tuesday turnaround Tuesday is usually the fake outs."
"10374780","10380200"," It's where regardless of direction, if it's going up or down, they'll usually take us the opposite"
"10380200","10380760"," side."
"10382080","10388320"," And get you all beard or bold up and then sell into you or they're buying while you're selling. "
"10389160","10390300"," So be aware of that tomorrow."
"10392080","10393420"," What the fuck Wednesday, right?"
"10393700","10398500"," So let's just say we have a down day on Tuesday and then what the fuck Wednesday is the turnaround"
"10398500","10399220"," to the upside."
"10400020","10400460"," Right?"
"10400680","10403780"," So let's look at a 30 minute chart here and just talk about that really quick, okay?"
"10404980","10407580"," So we're not getting to where we want to get to here. "
"10409840","10413080"," We're not getting to where we want to be here, right?"
"10413900","10418400"," So here's, I would just go over to the trigger screen here."
"10419040","10420420"," We want to be higher, right?"
"10420580","10423000"," All the bulls are like higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, higher, right?"
"10424220","10426980"," We are above Friday's high."
"10427360","10430520"," We're above Thursday's high right here right now. "
"10431420","10439300"," So just sort of an intro, like what I would like to see, right, is some kind of, at least"
"10439300","10440480"," something like this, right?"
"10441240","10445580"," Close like this, something like this in the close today, right?"
"10445820","10447740"," And then you might get the turnaround Tuesday, right?"
"10447840","10450200"," You wake up tomorrow and it's a fucking bloodbath, right?"
"10450580","10452360"," And you're all scared, paranoid."
"10453860","10454680"," It was the hourly trigger."
"10455600","10458480"," And there's actually another dip buy down here on Tuesday, okay?"
"10459620","10461660"," Here's your what the fuck Wednesday over here. "
"10462300","10465560"," Take the profit on Thursday selling to Friday, right?"
"10466940","10468360"," And that's where you get your sell down."
"10468580","10476960"," So as of right now, into the end of the day today, they might try to do something like this,"
"10477040","10477200"," right?"
"10477360","10479400"," They squeeze it up in here and then they hold it here."
"10479560","10481820"," And you're thinking, you're thinking, yeah, tomorrow we're going to wake up there. "
"10481860","10484300"," But in fact, it's just none of the fake out to the downside."
"10484920","10487400"," And then we actually make that trip up here in a Thursday, okay?"
"10487400","10492080"," So just be aware of that into the rest of the week, into tomorrow, that kind of stuff."
"10493380","10498480"," And that we're coming into that what the fuck 130 time in the afternoon, okay?"
"10499460","10502060"," So just look at this R1 right here, okay?"
"10502860","10505900"," Into the close, you want to be holding this R1 down here. "
"10506660","10511180"," You also want to be holding if you're a bull, this hourly trigger down below it, 46826."
"10512600","10517080"," There's still some more time here on the hourly velocity to get that new high."
"10517680","10522160"," To keep us above into the close, but remember what I said to you. "
"10522320","10525120"," Let's say you get that push higher into the close today."
"10525180","10527300"," If you do get that push higher in the close today, right?"
"10527780","10530900"," And they saw you down into this tomorrow on Tuesday."
"10531320","10535440"," And there's a quick bloodbath, like a bear hitting rundown here and you're all panicking. "
"10535800","10539040"," And if you're a bear, you can take that trade if that happens, right?"
"10539240","10541120"," But don't get all bear it up as my point, right?"
"10541300","10542180"," That's the what the fuck Wednesday."
"10542920","10544560"," You're like, oh, yeah, everything's fucking awesome."
"10544560","10546740"," We're going to sell this fucker down to the depths of L."
"10546740","10548460"," And then we go to the close. "
"10548900","10549820"," You're chasing the hole."
"10550200","10554980"," You become the hole and then you get the what the fuck Wednesday where we actually slam up here and"
"10554980","10556080"," take out that 475."
"10557300","10558700"," So just be aware of that. "
"10558880","10562820"," Have that market awareness as the rest of the week progresses."
"10564020","10568660"," Now, if let's say we get a move where we go straight up here today and it's tomorrow."
"10568780","10569500"," We just keep going up. "
"10570000","10571920"," We're still going to want to sell that shit down there, okay?"
"10572600","10575060"," Get underneath that hourly trigger and then get to the downside."
"10575060","10582580"," So just have that market awareness into the next end of the day."
"10583520","10585920"," I know that you guys are already looking at this. "
"10586000","10587820"," I think this reminds me of last Friday, right?"
"10588080","10589520"," You're going to be like, yeah, we're topping here, cop."
"10590100","10591040"," Start slamming, slamming."
"10591300","10592940"," They're going to bloodbath down to the close, right?"
"10593180","10594220"," I'm assuming that's what you're thinking. "
"10594920","10600200"," I'm going to give you a little bit of a little bit of that R1 right there."
"10601220","10605120"," You know, you do something like this and you think we're going to go down to the depths of the"
"10605120","10605120"," day."
"10605120","10606420"," It's like we did on Friday and Thursday. "
"10606840","10611640"," In fact, it holds and we actually slam up into this into the close today, okay?"
"10612140","10617420"," And then you actually get the sell down tomorrow that you're not ready for, okay?"
"10617520","10622720"," Just be aware of that possibility into today specifically, okay?"
"10623380","10624200"," Just be aware of it."
"10625860","10629060"," If you do see, here's that five minute check back happening."
"10629060","10630060"," Hopefully you can get it right now. "
"10630660","10634180"," We can get us that five minute check back and touch this five minute trigger."
"10634600","10639800"," Now you know also that if we do begin to roll, you know what you're looking for, right?"
"10639980","10642920"," You're looking for this blood down here."
"10643020","10644260"," Test the five minute, right?"
"10644380","10645320"," But you're still not short. "
"10645520","10650060"," You can take the short here, but you know that even if they tip their dick through there, likely"
"10650060","10653040"," going to come back up here and do this kind of nonsense."
"10654160","10657960"," The real trade is right there and the roll down on the one in five minute."
"10658000","10659320"," You're going to be Johnny on the spot. "
"10659320","10661120"," Take this down to the hourly trigger, okay?"
"10661700","10663380"," Just let this all work itself out."
"10663960","10665700"," If you're going to get short and get crazy."
"10666740","10671800"," But otherwise my expectation here for the end of the day is that we trade our two into the close"
"10671800","10672060"," today. "
"10672640","10677340"," I am still bullish at this point for just a check back on the five minute and then trade for"
"10677340","10684060"," 72-27 unless we get to confirmation on the bear plane or whatever you want to call it."
"10684440","10685900"," I think they're going to trick you today."
"10686300","10689960"," I think they're going to run it up into the close and then what's going to happen is tomorrow is"
"10689960","10690780"," where the real sell comes. "
"10690780","10693000"," The close is probably where the sell is."
"10693880","10696940"," So we'll watch it as it plays out here today."
"10697120","10699000"," There's that nice little red bars down there. "
"10699220","10703080"," I want you to take you all the way down there to that stink pit down below."
"10714010","10715910"," I know you see that check finally."
"10716290","10716830"," No shit dude. "
"10717650","10719690"," Like test the fucking five minute please."
"10720190","10721730"," Please check five minute."
"10722510","10724870"," And this is another thing here. "
"10725090","10730270"," If you're feeling bearish here right before this happens, if you're feeling bearish when I say I"
"10730270","10732510"," want to check the five minute, I'm going to show you what I'm looking for."
"10733330","10733770"," Okay."
"10734330","10735890"," I'm looking for the five minute check here. "
"10736510","10738650"," I'm going to look for a little bit of a liquidation break."
"10739410","10741610"," And then what I'm looking for is this."
"10742610","10746530"," I'm looking for the bulls to come back and not fail right here. "
"10747310","10749150"," I want to see the bulls come back up here."
"10749430","10749630"," Whoop."
"10750430","10751870"," Come right back down here. "
"10752050","10752150"," Whoop."
"10753590","10756030"," Just like that and if I see that action right there."
"10756470","10759450"," Take that fucker long right up into the close there. "
"10761910","10763990"," Be careful if you're a bear."
"10764230","10764350"," Okay."
"10767570","10769150"," I think you get your down. "
"10769650","10771450"," I just think that it's more like the close."
"10772250","10775370"," And when you get your down, if you do get it that way and you get it down into tomorrow,"
"10775690","10776270"," whatever you do."
"10776370","10778130"," If you're not watching me tomorrow at the close. "
"10778830","10781570"," If we're bleeding off into the close on Tuesday or some shit like that."
"10782170","10784450"," We're right down there in that hourly fucking trigger down there."
"10784450","10788250"," Just be like I'm going to close my shorts and fucking take the money and run. "
"10789870","10791870"," I'm not expecting that blood just yet."
"10792110","10793950"," That big role that we're expecting."
"10794190","10795270"," I don't see it happening today. "
"10795870","10796530"," I see it happening."
"10796990","10798910"," I just don't see it happening tomorrow today."
"10799270","10799710"," That kind of thing. "
"10801310","10802510"," I guess you could get a fucking."
"10802910","10804690"," I guess you could get a put spread right where we are."
"10805710","10808090"," For like two weeks or three weeks out if you wanted to. "
"10808370","10811370"," But I guess you could get shorter in some ways."
"10811370","10813070"," Or I guess long puts, but."
"10817310","10817790"," Anyways. "
"10828140","10831120"," Yeah, I like I see the role."
"10831280","10834800"," I just don't see it like when you, not you, but not you either chase."
"10835960","10839620"," I know Chase knows that there are people pimping in ped when on Sunday. "
"10840580","10845160"," I know that chase for a fact fucking knows that people were pimping in ped when that price was."
"10845160","10846560"," We were in a negative gamma."
"10846900","10848860"," We're not in fucking negative gamma today, are we?"
"10849820","10851800"," So it's like the timing matters, right?"
"10851920","10853380"," When the roll comes, the timing is going to matter. "
"10853660","10855960"," I guess if you were, you want to put spread here, it would be fine."
"10856200","10856900"," It would work."
"10857940","10862500"," But for me, I'd like to see the, I'd like to see the confirmation of the actual roll below the"
"10862500","10863940"," hourly trigger to take that trade. "
"10866380","10868160"," I think this is an up a week."
"10869340","10870160"," Or price."
"10870620","10872440"," And then we get the fucking role to the downside. "
"10873260","10874360"," It could be wrong too."
"10874660","10877020"," But where we are right now is not too bad."
"10877720","10885160"," 471, like even if we traded 475, just build the spread that can absorb that with time enough to"
"10885160","10885740"," roll down. "
"10886340","10888060"," And tag that 462."
"10888460","10889520"," That's your target, by the way."
"10891940","10893020"," 462 is your target. "
"10893360","10894880"," We can go lower, but that's your target."
"10894880","10896740"," That's your spread target."
"10897080","10898000"," You take the money and run. "
"10898700","10902720"," And then you fucking take on the next trade from there lower if we go, if we end up going"
"10902720","10903060"," lower."
"10903780","10904620"," Trade that 420."
"10912400","10913060"," Yeah, yeah, Chase. "
"10914580","10915400"," 100% brother."
"10919930","10921910"," Yeah, I'm not taking a put spread here."
"10921970","10925190"," I just, the time needs to be on it to get down there to do it. "
"10930390","10934750"," I feel like, I feel like there's like a trick here, not a trick, but like I feel like they"
"10934750","10935950"," run it up into the fucking clothes."
"10935950","10938810"," And then there goes, you get your fucking blood back tomorrow, man."
"10943190","10944170"," All right, I'll be back. "
"10944310","10946810"," I got to take a call and I got to make some decisions."
"10947390","10952370"," I will be here in the office, but I got some stuff in the background I got to do."
"10960090","10963610"," No, you're not seeing 3500. "
"10964010","10967730"," You have about a 1% chance of seeing 3500."
"10968330","10973390"," You have a 5% chance, 15% chance of seeing 3800."
"10974770","10975590"," Promise you. "
"10977750","10981590"," I'm not saying there's not a chance, but there's always a fucking chance."
"10982290","10985890"," But betting your money on 3500, get fucked."
"10986350","10990990"," Anybody out there pimping that shit, peddling that shit is out of their fucking minds. "
"10993050","10994950"," Well, unless they know something, we don't know."
"10995230","10996170"," They could be something unknown."
"10996370","10997030"," Maybe they know something. "
"10997370","11000870"," They're betting this on a war or something or somebody dying or terror stack."
"11000870","11004110"," I'm telling you what, outside of that shit, they're out of their fucking minds."
"11004830","11007230"," And 3500, the door was closed on already. "
"11008610","11010050"," You need rate cuts, man."
"11010290","11012070"," It ain't happening unless you get rate cuts."
"11012550","11013970"," It was better or something unknown. "
"11014190","11016870"," I promise you, dude, that ain't fucking happening."
"11017170","11018310"," You're out of their fucking minds."
"11020030","11022250"," You get one more bull run right now. "
"11022630","11023950"," That's what's lined up at least."
"11025770","11029630"," You're looking for a likely a March low."
"11030950","11035090"," I could give you an exact date, but we'll see if I can give you an exact date on there. "
"11036010","11036730"," In and around."
"11036990","11038770"," You want to know a low you're looking to buy?"
"11042370","11043190"," I got the dates."
"11043310","11046590"," I got that calendar because I'm going to give you guys a bunch of dates, too, for the year. "
"11047490","11051790"," And you're going to go and you're going to put these dates into your phone, Gmail, and you're going"
"11051790","11053770"," to set an alarm about a week before."
"11053770","11057890"," And then you're going to set an alarm for the day for the date, the trading day."
"11058390","11062590"," And the first one is going to alert you, hey, start thinking about a bottom. "
"11063010","11067990"," And then you're going to have an actual date where you should be tagging a bottom in and around"
"11067990","11068190"," there."
"11068350","11069190"," Now, that's not guaranteed."
"11070030","11074230"," You have to compare that with market conditions, but you need to be aware of it. "
"11074690","11084660"," So the expectation here for your yearly low is the 57th trading"
"11084660","11085160"," day."
"11085820","11087240"," 56th trading day of the year."
"11087640","11088460"," And I got my new calendar. "
"11088460","11090440"," I got my you guys haven't seen it yet."
"11091060","11093360"," I got my new calendar, my hot guys calendar."
"11094980","11096680"," And you should get one for yourself. "
"11097580","11101020"," I like it on paper so I can show you guys hot guys."
"11102180","11105340"," So the 57th trading 56th trading day of the year."
"11105880","11107040"," Anybody know what up top of their head?"
"11109280","11111140"," It's March 21st. "
"11111140","11115820"," So in and around March 21st of this year, you're looking for by the fucking dip."
"11116260","11123500"," Now, if that's 380, 480, enough for like, 380, 350 or something like that."
"11123760","11123800"," Sure. "
"11124480","11125440"," I suck it."
"11125700","11126580"," I suck at price."
"11126960","11131880"," So if you want to think it's 380, 350, so be it. "
"11132020","11134700"," But right around that 56th day, that's 21st of March."
"11136720","11138720"," That's your first dip by."
"11140060","11141220"," For the year. "
"11141760","11145540"," If you're an investor, you're looking to buy that low."
"11146300","11148000"," Now, there's another low coming on the."
"11149320","11152740"," Should be on the 90. "
"11155940","11159460"," 92nd or 91st trading day of the year."
"11160360","11162380"," That is where."
"11167390","11171190"," That's May 10th or 12th somewhere in that weekend. "
"11171190","11172970"," You guys writing this down."
"11173490","11178770"," And then you're going to have the next big dip by for the year is going to be on the"
"11178770","11179750"," hundred and."
"11181790","11182890"," 88th day of the year. "
"11186170","11188490"," That is in or around."
"11192070","11193110"," September 30th."
"11193110","11200310"," So there you go. "
"11200310","11200670"," September 30th."
"11201270","11202770"," Three buys for you this year."
"11203630","11204250"," All free. "
"11212970","11215690"," So those are your three dip buys for the market this year."
"11216110","11217690"," Hopefully you guys were listening when I gave them to you."
"11217970","11221110"," If you weren't, you're going to get them in a expectation for the year. "
"11222390","11223150"," When to be buying."
"11235390","11236150"," Just give it a minute."
"11236290","11238030"," You should see a little quick liquidation break. "
"11238190","11239770"," Sometimes you see a little quick little creation break."
"11240550","11241530"," Freaking people out."
"11244550","11247110"," You're thinking sub 4000 this year. "
"11247230","11248490"," I'll bet you that it doesn't."
"11250410","11251290"," I'll bet you."
"11251530","11253310"," And I'll say I would say this though. "
"11253550","11254930"," If there was a downside move."
"11255830","11257410"," The deepest it should go."
"11258430","11261190"," Is 38 to 3900. "
"11261490","11263090"," That would be the worst case scenario."
"11263750","11265370"," Like our probability wise."
"11265950","11271350"," So if you had like a high probability like 30% 15 to 30% chance. "
"11272150","11274110"," I would say give it a 15 to 30% chance."
"11274110","11276950"," You could possibly get to 3800 3900."
"11277550","11279250"," But I don't think that's your. "
"11280310","11281890"," I don't think you trade to that."
"11282090","11283550"," But you could trade to that."
"11284550","11285650"," If we get to 4000. "
"11286250","11286830"," I think we get to."
"11287010","11287630"," I think I have it."
"11287890","11290810"," We're getting a 42 or 4100 as the low. "
"11291070","11292190"," That's the expectation."
"11292690","11294830"," The low is like I think it's 41 to 4200."
"11295030","11296010"," I got it on a chart here. "
"11296030","11297410"," You guys are going to get the access to it."
"11298390","11301270"," That you can get an extension of the downside of 38 to 3900."
"11301270","11301830"," It's possible. "
"11302330","11305850"," But at that point that would be wrapping up my short."
"11306530","11306570"," Right."
"11307510","11308790"," So like wrapping up that low. "
"11309450","11311030"," Target of 42 to 4100."
"11311550","11314090"," And then day trade the rest of it down to that number."
"11314750","11315890"," So Chase just said. "
"11316370","11318310"," He expects below 4000 this year."
"11318510","11320350"," So if you do expect that right."
"11320350","11321850"," I'm on board with you. "
"11322370","11325510"," To about 42 to 4100 somewhere in there."
"11325650","11326630"," I'm on board with you."
"11327250","11331210"," I'm not on board with you to 38 or 3900 or any lower. "
"11331450","11332990"," And if we do go down to that price."
"11333670","11335810"," I would be like weeklies or."
"11336490","11337630"," A monthlies when we're there. "
"11337630","11338590"," I would take that trade."
"11338590","11340130"," But I'd be wrapping up the trade."
"11341090","11342730"," I'm going to assure you of something. "
"11342910","11344010"," There's a lot of fucking sellers."
"11344010","11345710"," They'll be wrapping up that trade too."
"11345990","11347910"," Around that 42 and 4100. "
"11347910","11349530"," So just we can go there."
"11349630","11351290"," Just don't be trading to it."
"11351310","11352610"," Don't be like yeah my spread is. "
"11352890","11353510"," I don't know."
"11354010","11354410"," 3800."
"11355670","11359070"," My the width of my spread is 38 and 3850 or something. "
"11359250","11359350"," Right."
"11359630","11360810"," You do that shit and you get close."
"11360990","11361750"," But not no cigar. "
"11362170","11362870"," No time left."
"11363030","11364990"," You know your spread is going to start burning as we head in."
"11365310","11366170"," As we get down there. "
"11366210","11366750"," But don't hit it."
"11366850","11367610"," It'll start burning."
"11367890","11368790"," So be careful. "
"11369790","11370590"," On whatever."
"11370910","11372470"," However you structure that trade."
"11377250","11377650"," Yeah. "
"11378450","11379110"," Worn you guys."
"11379330","11379890"," You guys are."
"11380430","11380990"," Binky. "
"11381530","11383170"," Mark the fucking time in this video."
"11383770","11385190"," As we'll revisit this."
"11385310","11386090"," Should I promise you. "
"11388230","11389850"," I'm sure you have it."
"11390590","11391890"," Remember something too man."
"11391970","11393250"," When somebody's telling you right. "
"11393870","11395410"," Remember something here right."
"11395750","11396470"," I want you to remember something."
"11397410","11399970"," Earlier this morning I was talking to you about. "
"11400890","11401950"," You don't know."
"11403410","11404450"," You don't know."
"11406190","11407730"," Here let me say something to you guys. "
"11407870","11407990"," Okay."
"11408150","11409550"," You guys aren't going to believe this."
"11409650","11412810"," I encounter this a lot with. "
"11413210","11413550"," Passables."
"11413670","11416450"," For the price of one month."
"11416910","11418110"," And say ninety two percent. "
"11418530","11419630"," I'm going to tell you guys something."
"11419850","11420010"," Okay."
"11420770","11421350"," This is the truth. "
"11422670","11425430"," There are people out there that you and I listen to."
"11425590","11425830"," Okay."
"11426690","11427990"," With a million followers. "
"11428770","11429090"," Right."
"11429370","11429510"," Whatever."
"11429510","11432950"," Three four hundred thousand five hundred thousand million followers. "
"11433930","11434530"," Right."
"11435230","11437230"," If I was taking a position."
"11438230","11439810"," For downside move. "
"11441690","11442290"," Into."
"11444950","11447050"," Forty one or forty two hundred right."
"11447390","11448590"," I was taking that position. "
"11449150","11450250"," With let's say."
"11450730","11452090"," Twenty million dollars."
"11453070","11453670"," Right. "
"11453850","11454730"," Twenty million dollars right."
"11455350","11456610"," It would be easy for me."
"11456610","11457750"," Especially if I had. "
"11458530","11460350"," The right people following me."
"11460490","11462150"," I mean like on Bloomberg and see."
"11462270","11463810"," Think about the larger picture here. "
"11464230","11464730"," Think about."
"11466750","11467590"," The commercial."
"11468870","11469290"," Traders. "
"11469290","11469570"," Okay."
"11469710","11470290"," Commercial traders."
"11470630","11471550"," These are hedge fund guys. "
"11471770","11471850"," Right."
"11472050","11472810"," Not guys on Fintuit."
"11472970","11475030"," Like a guy that knows what I'm doing. "
"11475030","11475370"," Right."
"11476710","11480430"," But then I get to know a guy like the guy that maybe might be on Fintuit."
"11480430","11480690"," Right. "
"11481310","11484390"," I need to push a narrative that we're going to go to thirty eight hundred."
"11484390","11487590"," So that I can print my forty one or forty two."
"11487970","11489310"," Does that make sense to you. "
"11490730","11493850"," So I'm only looking to print forty one or forty two hundred."
"11494530","11497310"," But I need to publicly tell you."
"11497770","11498950"," We can go to thirty eight. "
"11499850","11502710"," So that they get the expansion of puts."
"11504150","11507150"," Down to thirty eight hundred to just tag the forty one."
"11507810","11508290"," Right. "
"11508550","11510050"," So I tell you we're going to five thousand."
"11510170","11511390"," We actually go to forty eight."
"11511390","11512690"," The position is to exit at forty eight. "
"11513570","11515890"," And I can actually move markets with that sentiment."
"11517110","11517430"," Right."
"11517610","11518270"," That you think that. "
"11518430","11519530"," So the Kool-Aid right."
"11519710","11521010"," This is the Kool-Aid for the bulls and the bears."
"11521390","11524850"," So just think about that when you're looking for that under four thousand. "
"11525630","11526670"," Because you're trusting."
"11527290","11531050"," Some guy on CNBC and then some guy that's regurgitating in on Fintuit."
"11533210","11534170"," Their motivation. "
"11535730","11538010"," Might be for the range expansion."
"11539510","11541770"," To that thirty eight hundred but not the target."
"11542650","11544790"," What those people end up doing too is what. "
"11546310","11548850"," They tell you thirty eight hundred or thirty five hundred."
"11549270","11551890"," We in a let's say we had a pit and fucking I don't know."
"11552090","11554350"," Forty one hundred or four thousand let's say. "
"11554910","11556490"," But not the thirty eight or thirty nine."
"11557690","11557930"," Right."
"11558190","11558610"," And what do they do. "
"11559550","11560810"," We had we bounced."
"11561430","11561550"," Right."
"11561890","11563290"," They close their position already. "
"11563290","11566690"," You hear it from like guys like Mike Mike Mike Barry right."
"11567990","11571330"," He comes or he has to show publicly what he was trade was."
"11571530","11573770"," He closed like what weeks before it comes public. "
"11574590","11574850"," Right."
"11575070","11578650"," And usually when they're right you're like oh they were calling for us but they closed anyways at"
"11578650","11580430"," this higher or higher low or whatever."
"11581010","11583530"," They just bulls do the same thing but just be careful of. "
"11584090","11588130"," When you're when you're hearing these people regurgitating goes down the line down the line to the"
"11588130","11589350"," guy that you listen to."
"11590550","11593450"," They're probably getting it from somebody that's positioned only forty one hundred."
"11593830","11595650"," You're not positioned to the thirty eight. "
"11596010","11601290"," I know we got the thirty eight on the SPX on the JPM caller and stuff like that but."
"11602170","11603050"," Speak carefully."
"11604330","11605450"," What we actually do. "
"11615570","11616570"," You can trade it."
"11617130","11619470"," Just don't bet your whole fucking bank on it."
"11619730","11624190"," Like take the money and run at the forty one or forty two. "
"11625650","11626270"," Same thing."
"11626450","11627490"," That's I do that shit on the upside."
"11627650","11628790"," You guys see me do this right. "
"11629010","11629770"," Take a nice spread."
"11630090","11630670"," Ride it up."
"11630890","11631670"," Take the money and run. "
"11632430","11634790"," And then I if we keep climbing I just keep trading it up."
"11634930","11635350"," Trade it up."
"11635350","11636190"," Trade it up to the role. "
"11637030","11638210"," Be aware of that okay."
"11648900","11650660"," Yeah you know war is not so bad though."
"11651020","11652460"," Why don't you guys understand something. "
"11654180","11655940"," Remember when I say this okay."
"11656300","11658300"," Gotta be fucking crystal clear in this."
"11659500","11663880"," Unknown news is not the fucking news that the banks already know. "
"11664240","11666060"," Gotta be clear on that okay."
"11666900","11668860"," It's like unknown news is different."
"11669960","11671060"," I gotta get some books. "
"11671300","11672760"," I gotta get a list of books for you guys."
"11674120","11679200"," There's books of ex like Goldman Sachs guys."
"11679660","11683360"," They do they do they go to like they go to like Yale and shit and talk about this. "
"11683500","11686620"," There's there's like long lectures you can watch on this stuff."
"11686620","11688400"," These guys are like the fucking CIA."
"11689420","11691900"," Talking about unknown news to them. "
"11692800","11698320"," They like the CIA I'm telling you banks are like the fucking CIA the NSA like these guys have"
"11698320","11700180"," people in every fucking country."
"11700180","11703100"," So if there's gonna be a war they already know."
"11703560","11705640"," It's literally gonna be priced in. "
"11706060","11708740"," It's the unknown shit that is not priced in."
"11718750","11720370"," Anyways you know we'll do."
"11722110","11725810"," I already posted the chart on fence hood of what my expectations are for the year. "
"11725890","11729770"," We're gonna go back at the end of the year and look at that versus what the actual market did"
"11729770","11732410"," and we'll see how far off I am."
"11732530","11737750"," I'm gonna guarantee that I'm not going to get really a 30% chance that I'm pretty fucking close to"
"11737750","11739270"," what the expectations are for this year."
"11739930","11741130"," Unless those two things happen. "
"11741650","11743410"," Let's just start seeing fucking Jerome cotton."
"11745270","11747850"," That fucking guy cuts though that shits off the table."
"11748350","11749070"," Sell everything. "
"11749710","11750450"," Sell it all."
"11751710","11752330"," I got to go."
"11774560","11776360"," Who just said they were bearish as fuck. "
"11776820","11778120"," I can say in that."
"11779820","11780740"," I'm bearish too."
"11781000","11782400"," Just not as bearish as others are. "
"11782520","11783540"," Who said they're bearish as fuck."
"11784020","11784600"," Who wrote that?"
"11787000","11787660"," Is he that?"
"11787820","11788480"," I don't know who that is."
"11788600","11789200"," Who said that?"
"11790220","11791460"," I gotta see who wrote that. "
"11793340","11794240"," I'm bearish here."
"11794360","11794720"," Just not."
"11795060","11796520"," I don't think it's the bearish that you think. "
"11796960","11798600"," I don't think I'm the bearish that you are."
"11799340","11800700"," I'm bearish in a march too."
"11800840","11802100"," So I'm bearish. "
"11802800","11804060"," Like overall bearish."
"11804140","11805620"," It's not as bearish as some of you are."
"12199370","12201630"," Read that we did when we did it. "
"12201890","12205450"," Right after what happened last week rates sort of backed up just a little bit."
"12205550","12209310"," People got a little nervous about whether they're over their skis on what the Fed might do."
"12209310","12209990"," Yeah, exactly. "
"12210270","12215710"," Now, I've been a little bit of a, you know, throw some cool water on inflation expectations based"
"12215710","12216550"," on these measures."
"12217310","12219210"," But it does fit in with the data too."
"12219410","12222790"," So it's not something that I think you have to say is some kind of an outlier. "
"12222970","12223630"," So I do agree with that."
"12223630","12226930"," This is good inflation is back to pre-pandemic levels."
"12227430","12231370"," Services inflation is moving more slowly and we're not expecting big drops. "
"12231370","12235710"," If you look at the 10 year treasury in price terms, it's like a stock that went from 91 to"
"12235710","12237210"," 105 and it's pulled back to 103."
"12237210","12239210"," So it didn't really change the trend."
"12239370","12239730"," Yeah, no. "
"12239890","12240790"," It's an epic move in November."
"12241290","12241910"," That's clear."
"12242270","12242350"," All right. "
"12242550","12242650"," Cool."
"12242910","12243910"," I'll see you on closing bell."
"12244070","12245310"," That's Mike Santoli coming up. "
"12245650","12247970"," More contrarian ideas for 2024."
"12248570","12253330"," Anastasia is going to tell us why it is time to bet on this unloved part of the market and"
"12253330","12254230"," she'll do it when we come back."
"12277590","12282990"," Feds Bostik says many economic measures are back at level seen in the years immediately before the"
"12282990","12283470"," pandemic. "
"12330560","12336030"," Feds Bostik says at this point shorter term measures of inflation such as over three and six months"
"12336030","12337410"," are more important."
"12337870","12339570"," They are pointing in a positive direction."
"12406150","12406590"," Confidence. "
"12408550","12413310"," I want to continue our contrarian picks by our committee members."
"12413430","12415110"," Anastasia is with us today."
"12415930","12416790"," So what are you even thinking about?"
"12417250","12420870"," Real estate, commercial real estate in both public and private markets. "
"12420870","12424870"," And I would actually say across the entire capital stack equity and also debt."
"12425210","12427570"," And first of all Scott, talk about a hated asset class."
"12427830","12428090"," That's right. "
"12428230","12432690"," You know, there's so many concerns about maturity and the $1.5 trillion that needs to be"
"12432690","12432890"," refinanceed."
"12433650","12437010"," And by the way, some of those mortgages were taken out at three and a half percent interest rates."
"12437210","12438750"," They need to be refided six and a half. "
"12439030","12440090"," So clearly that's a concern."
"12440570","12444350"," Then there's the office vacancies and that's been so well telegraphed and talked about."
"12444770","12450670"," What we're talking about. "
"12450670","12455190"," If you look at flows into commercial real estate, they have slowed to a trickle last year."
"12455770","12459770"," And the performance in the public markets reads the IYRATF is up about eight percent."
"12460250","12462190"," And the S&P was up 24 percent last year. "
"12462330","12466110"," So I think I've made the case that this is not an asset class that is well-liked and very"
"12466110","12466730"," contrarian."
"12467090","12468490"," But here's my take."
"12468930","12472950"," Yes, there's concerns about the wall of maturity and who's going to refi that. "
"12473130","12478990"," But there's also a big pool of capital both in private credit and real estate funds, private funds"
"12478990","12482050"," that are eager to lend to the commercial real estate space."
"12482290","12482770"," Because guess what?"
"12482910","12485150"," They're getting paid about nine percent for that debt."
"12485410","12487010"," So I think there are providers of capital. "
"12487770","12491530"," The other thing I would say is at this moment, I'm not comfortable declaring victory."
"12491850","12493370"," The Fed needs to remain vigilant."
"12493890","12495150"," Some of those real estate debt operators. "
"12495210","12497030"," And short-round attention to that."
"12497270","12502550"," Because ninety percent of the real estate companies can actually service their debt and have the"
"12502550","12504770"," appropriate coverage ratios over and above one."
"12505070","12506390"," So that's a lot of resiliency. "
"12506390","12510090"," And then Scott, the last point, office, yes, it is a concern."
"12510610","12512750"," Yes, we're going to see higher defaults there."
"12512910","12515230"," But it's a relatively small asset class. "
"12515610","12519310"," It's about 16 percent of the maturities that are out there."
"12519390","12522130"," It's about 15 percent of the overall CRA assets."
"12522530","12526050"," And it's just about two and a half percent of the overall physical assets in the United States. "
"12526390","12528430"," So we're not talking about broad-based stress here."
"12528690","12531050"," So I would be looking to buy public reads."
"12531530","12533950"," I would be looking to buy a real estate debt. "
"12534430","12537210"," And I think that's exactly what some of the managers were talking about."
"12537590","12537870"," All right."
"12538090","12538350"," Good stuff. "
"12538630","12539070"," Thank you for that."
"12539350","12540630"," Final trades coming up next."
"12542390","12574160"," The Fed's"
"12574160","12577180"," Bostik says top line job numbers have been pretty strong. "
"12577620","12581560"," But the recent strength has been focused in a relatively small part of the economy."
"12609970","12610690"," Oh, yeah."
"12611030","12615950"," Well, you bears out there were thinking it was going to be a repeat of Thursday Friday. "
"12616290","12618510"," It's not showing a repeat right now, is it?"
"12618730","12619590"," Not yet it isn't."
"12621450","12623430"," Remember 130 danger zone."
"12697370","12729210"," All right,"
"12729210","12730710"," just heads up here, boys and girls. "
"12731250","12732910"," Just wanted to do a quick check in with you guys."
"12734370","12738190"," You got HYG grinding up here to close the gap to the upside."
"12738990","12740430"," It's a pretty, pretty large gap. "
"12740610","12742990"," The 77 76 still left behind."
"12744030","12744210"," Dixie."
"12745690","12747610"," Retreating to the upside right now. "
"12748150","12749930"," Not necessarily a bad thing."
"12750150","12753850"," This 102 area, the support here, 102, not necessarily bearish."
"12755490","12759830"," But it is turning bullish right now in Dixie, which is an indication that we're getting a little"
"12759830","12761110"," top heavy here. "
"12762030","12768170"," Vix is also retesting its lows back from the fifth down below here."
"12768310","12771890"," So we want to keep an eye on Vix as well as it continues to the downside."
"12772670","12775970"," We get a giant squeeze to the upside or if we're going to start top here. "
"12776510","12779470"," Apple getting a little top here as well, a little bit of a double top here."
"12780090","12780770"," T and X."
"12781630","12783570"," This is your bonds, right?"
"12783790","12785970"," This is looking like it wants to go up as well."
"12786270","12788270"," So check out T and X looking bullish here. "
"12788570","12790450"," Just be careful of a roll to the downside."
"12792230","12796610"," It's looking kind of sketchy here for the bulls at least."
"12855810","12858970"," Five, three o'clock Eastern closing bell. "
"12859010","12861030"," I hope you'll join me as we walk you through this final stretch."
"12861030","12862990"," By the way, markets coming back quite nicely too."
"12863170","12864850"," Down might actually go positive before we say goodbye. "
"12865550","12869070"," AJ Oden, Cameron Dawson, Kevin Simpson, they'll join me at three o'clock."
"12869210","12869810"," And I hope you will as well."
"12870210","12871890"," In the meantime, Mr. West. "
"12872270","12873490"," What is your final trade?"
"12873730","12875510"," Microsoft, I think you're seeing the momentum."
"12875990","12877610"," The sellers got out of the way last week."
"12877710","12878810"," I think we went to continues. "
"12879350","12883350"," And I think we're actually going to see a pretty good earnings result when they report over the"
"12883350","12883930"," next few weeks."
"12884330","12885130"," Okay, Parmesan."
"12885930","12890050"," Blackrock increasing assets under management as the market rallies increases their fees. "
"12891950","12893750"," Cybersecurity, a really strong area of growth."
"12894110","12897550"," 14% during 24 growth expected in cybersecurity."
"12897670","12899650"," And it's not back to it's all time high. "
"12899870","12900250"," So I like that."
"12900410","12904990"," She Goldman Sachs cleared the 380 high from last year four to quarter next target."
"12905070","12906070"," You bought it late last week. "
"12906210","12906330"," Yes."
"12906490","12906710"," All right."
"12906750","12907450"," I'll see you on the closing bell. "
"12911250","12914280"," And welcome to the exchange."
"12914660","12915960"," Good Monday morning, everybody."
"12915960","12916860"," I'm Kelly Evans. "
"12917080","12917740"," Here's what's ahead."
"12917740","12919420"," Another black guy for Boeing."
"12919700","12925840"," The shares are down sharply as the FAA rounds the 737 MAX9 for safety inspections after a piece of"
"12925840","12928180"," aircraft blew out during that Alaska Airlines flight. "
"12928480","12931820"," We've got the latest what happens from here and the economic ripple effect."
"12932360","12937540"," Plus JP Morgan's healthcare conference is underway as we have a busy day for deal making in that"
"12937540","12939700"," space headlines coming in every moment now."
"12940020","12944920"," Jim Kramer brings us an exclusive interview with Medtronic CEO who is either to dispel the myth"
"12944920","12948620"," that weight loss drugs will lessen demand for medical devices going forward. "
"12949220","12951700"," And we'll look at how rate cuts will affect retail."
"12952160","12952820"," Yes, retail."
"12952960","12953720"," There are some winners. "
"12954020","12955000"," There are actually losers."
"12955500","12957740"," And our analysts conclusions may surprise you."
"12958060","12960040"," Before all that though, let's start with today's markets. "
"12960060","12961460"," Big moves in the NASDAQ."
"12961720","12962880"," Quieter in the Dow DOM."
"12963100","12964160"," Yeah, but it's still though. "
"12964300","12966900"," We're moving up towards those best levels of the session so far, Kelly."
"12967300","12970920"," And it's mixed only because there's a tiny speck of red right now on the Dow Jones industrial"
"12970920","12974020"," average, which is just about flat on the session down 12 points."
"12974020","12976080"," We were down a lot more earlier on in the session. "
"12976540","12979500"," 30,000, 37,455 the last rate for the Dow."
"12979640","12983800"," The S&P, the broader measure, is at 4731, which is up 35 points."
"12984180","12985660"," That's three quarters of 1%. "
"12985660","12987740"," And the NASDAQ composite tech heavier."
"12988000","12992200"," You can see where the outperformance is up one and a half percent to 14,742."
"12992680","12994920"," That's where 218 points to the upside. "
"12995800","12997700"," Kelly did mention some of the deal making news today."
"12998260","13002680"," Biotech, Bio Pharma, healthcare overall, very much in focus here because of that JP Morgan"
"13002680","13003860"," conference out in San Francisco."
"13003860","13006080"," But also because of merger Monday news. "
"13006320","13009100"," And Brics, Bio Pharma, Harpoon Therapeutics, Axonics."
"13009520","13014100"," Get and take over by Johnson and Johnson, Merck and Boston Scientific and kind of that order."
"13014280","13018680"," You can see there gains from anywhere from 20% all the way up to a doubling of their shares"
"13018680","13020260"," because of deal making. "
"13020700","13025320"," In biotech and medical services, the spider biotech ETF is up 2% right here."
"13025720","13028600"," And the spider healthcare ETF up about one quarter of 1% as well."
"13029220","13033120"," And then the stock of the day, Kelly also mentioned it is Boeing because Boeing shares right now. "
"13033120","13035420"," Down about, just about 15 or so points."
"13035740","13038540"," It's roughly worth 100 points of downside for the Dow."
"13038900","13042860"," If you want to look at it differently, the Dow would actually be up 100 points if it wasn't for"
"13042860","13043580"," Boeing right now. "
"13043880","13051200"," Because of what's happening right now with the 737-9 Max model jets being grounded, looking into"
"13051200","13052480"," that fuselage that blew off."
"13052760","13054720"," It's down 6% right now on the trade so far."
"13054920","13056740"," 233 spots, 75% the last trade. "
"13057000","13061360"," But again, if you look at the days so far, we've seen a bit of a roll over here."
"13061360","13063700"," But we're still off the worst levels of the session."
"13063700","13066740"," We were down about nine or so percent just at the opening bell. "
"13066940","13069520"," So Kelly, keep an eye on Boeing shares, a big drag on the Dow."
"13069740","13071180"," I know you're talking much more about this."
"13071200","13072160"," I'll send things back over to you. "
"13072260","13073540"," Indeed, that's where we start today."
"13073780","13074100"," Dom, thanks."
"13074220","13074760"," We'll see you in a bit. "
"13075300","13081180"," The company Boeing that is has now given airlines instructions on how to inspect their 737 Max jet"
"13081180","13081580"," liners."
"13081700","13086180"," About 20% of the company's deliveries last year were of this kind of aircraft, according to"
"13086180","13086560"," Jeffries."
"13086900","13089880"," Although they comprise far less of its future delivery pipeline. "
"13089880","13093000"," Let's get over to Philippo for the very latest at this hour, Phil."
"13094260","13098820"," And Kelly, those instructions that you mentioned, the fact that those have been sent to the"
"13098820","13101600"," airlines, and they've been approved by the FAA."
"13102540","13108860"," Theoretically, we could see some of the grounded Max 9's reenter service, maybe tomorrow, maybe the"
"13108860","13109600"," day after that. "
"13109780","13116240"," So that's an indication that the FAA and Boeing fairly confident in terms of what to look for to"
"13116240","13119000"," make sure that this type of an accident doesn't happen again."
"13119000","13120520"," I didn't say fairly confident."
"13120560","13121360"," They'd be very confident. "
"13121360","13122840"," Otherwise, it wouldn't go back into service."
"13123260","13127940"," The focus of the NTSB investigation, the fuselage plug that was ripped off of the Alaska Airlines"
"13127940","13128420"," plane."
"13128700","13132940"," That plane, by the way, had three separate incidents where there was problems with the"
"13132940","13133540"," pressurization. "
"13133880","13139300"," At least it signaled that through a warning light that they done checked and indicated they should"
"13139300","13142180"," go forward in terms of the airplane continuing to fly."
"13142600","13147700"," The data recorder analysis that'll be done in Washington later today and tonight over the next"
"13147700","13148300"," couple of days."
"13148300","13151480"," That should give investigators a fair amount of information as well. "
"13151900","13155800"," The seats near the Max 9 blowout where this took place, they were empty."
"13156320","13157640"," Thank goodness they were empty."
"13157980","13159380"," Otherwise, this could have been far worse. "
"13159380","13162420"," Also, thank goodness that this didn't happen at a higher altitude."
"13162520","13166920"," There were no serious injuries in this 737 Max 9 accident."
"13167080","13171200"," As you take a look at shares of Boeing, they have come back a little bit today, but they're still"
"13171200","13172720"," down more than 6%. "
"13172720","13178440"," As we mentioned, the FAA has approved the Max inspection process for those planes that are"
"13178440","13178740"," grounded."
"13179520","13183700"," Meanwhile, CEO Dave Calhoun, he's out in Renton, Washington, where they build the Max."
"13183980","13186180"," He will be holding an employee town hall tomorrow. "
"13186280","13189060"," Quickly want to take a look at shares of United and Alaska."
"13189520","13192820"," United operates 79 Max 9 planes."
"13193320","13197320"," There you see how it moved higher throughout the session, and especially within the last hour once"
"13197320","13200620"," the inspection process was approved by the FAA. "
"13200620","13206940"," Also, take a look at Alaska almost, almost positive after being down much more earlier in the"
"13206940","13207180"," session."
"13207480","13207640"," Kelly?"
"13208020","13209260"," That's interesting, though, what you said."
"13209380","13214440"," And I'm curious about one aspect of this because we've had some criticism about the fact that the"
"13214440","13219460"," data, the voice, explain the difference between the data recorder and the black box. "
"13219760","13227360"," One records all the data in the plane, and one is the cockpit voice recorder, which is what you"
"13227360","13228620"," when you hear the pilots and the crew."
"13228620","13232640"," And that did not record the cockpit voice recorder."
"13233280","13236240"," In this case, Kelly, you look, you always wanted if you're an investigator. "
"13236740","13242240"," In this case, I doubt that that is of a whole lot of significance because you can hear their"
"13242240","13247200"," interactions with the tower immediately after this accident took place where they say very calmly."
"13247640","13249640"," Look, we've had a depressurization event."
"13249960","13250900"," We need to turn around. "
"13250900","13251880"," We need to come in."
"13252000","13253360"," We're declaring emergency right away."
"13253860","13256320"," The data recorder is far more important. "
"13256680","13258160"," And that is always going."
"13258360","13258980"," That's not something."
"13259200","13264100"," So it has the voice aspect plus it's more comprehensive because some of the commentary making the"
"13264100","13269140"," rounds says that the U.S. should go the way of Europe and requiring this 25 hour. "
"13269740","13270920"," You could explain it better than me."
"13271420","13275480"," Time frame so that we don't run into this where it kind of auto deletes."
"13275640","13278240"," Do you think that's an important thing for us to do?"
"13278240","13282060"," Or does it sound like that having this data piece usurps the need for doing that?"
"13283680","13288540"," No, I think look, the NTSB has been fighting for this for a long time. "
"13288660","13293720"," They have said, why not have these data recorders record for 25 hours instead of where they are"
"13293720","13298340"," right now, which I believe they rerecord a rather short time frame."
"13298340","13303500"," And the argument among the safety regulators is this is a no brainer."
"13303740","13304320"," Do it. "
"13304580","13310120"," But like so many other things, Kelly, that are no brainers that they get caught up in bureaucracy"
"13310120","13312860"," and they don't happen, it just hasn't been approved."
"13313460","13316120"," I wonder if at some point that finally changes here."
"13316340","13321880"," In this case, the good news is in this case, I'm not sure the flight voice recorder, the cockpit"
"13321880","13325040"," voice recorder, would tell investigators a whole lot. "
"13325040","13328560"," Really what they want to look at is the fuselage as well as the data recorder."
"13328980","13332800"," You know, if nothing else, sometimes these unfortunate events have a way of shining a light on the"
"13332800","13336500"," need to make those updates that you referenced and maybe that will be something that comes of this,"
"13336620","13339020"," even if it wouldn't have changed the conclusions this time around."
"13339440","13340480"," So we appreciate it for now. "
"13340600","13340920"," Thank you, R."
"13341120","13341480"," Phil LeBeau."
"13342180","13344800"," Let's talk more about the markets more broadly."
"13345020","13348960"," As mentioned, Boeing is weighing significantly on the Dow today, but elsewhere, we're seeing the S "
"13348960","13351020","&P and the NASDAQ posting some nice gains. "
"13351020","13355580"," But my next guest says there's too much optimism and the market is no longer cheap."
"13356020","13357520"," Joining me now is Charlie the brain school."
"13359780","13362980"," Squeeze all these dirty shorts out every last one of these dirty dogs. "
"13363300","13363660"," Squeeze them."
"13365800","13366940"," It's been busy today."
"13367160","13367960"," Health care deals. "
"13368120","13371480"," Every time I turn around, there seems to be something else going on in that space."
"13371780","13373220"," Does that entice you as an investor?"
"13373560","13376160"," Do you have any kind of broader observations to draw from it?"
"13376160","13377760"," I own a couple."
"13378160","13384720"," We own ZIMV, which is dental implants and spinal products, and they can be taken over half their"
"13384720","13386760"," business and the stock is up 100%. "
"13386760","13390460"," So sure, as an owner, we have small and mid-cap value stocks."
"13391340","13396040"," M&A activity tends to be good for us because our portfolio companies tend to be bought rather than"
"13396040","13396960"," doing the buying."
"13397400","13399280"," I would say health care. "
"13399720","13406060"," There's a lot of change and change produces M&A and obviously the rollout of the new weight loss"
"13406060","13408640"," drugs is going to have big implications for lots of people."
"13409200","13414580"," And some companies in pharma who lived off of COVID drugs for the last couple of years and now"
"13414580","13415640"," looking again for drugs."
"13416040","13421400"," So there's going to be activity and activity tends to be good for small and mid-cap value. "
"13421400","13423580"," We've had a ton of activity in the health care space."
"13423960","13427140"," Again, I don't know, maybe some of it now coincides with the JP Morgan conference to talk more"
"13427140","13427780"," about that in a bid."
"13428040","13431960"," But we also, and I was surprised to see this headline that Leslie Picker was talking about earlier"
"13431960","13432520"," this morning. "
"13432800","13436640"," It's been a kind of a record-breaking year for activist investment as well."
"13437040","13440580"," It doesn't feel like it, but I guess there are some high-profile examples, Disney and so forth."
"13441620","13442800"," Why do you think that is?"
"13443120","13446540"," And I would imagine activism generally you would favor as a value investor?"
"13447900","13449920"," You know, that's a good question, Kelly. "
"13450260","13455540"," I have served on some public company boards and activist investors often make a lot of noise."
"13456280","13461480"," But a lot of the times of things they're recommending are relatively obvious by backstock, cut"
"13461480","13461860"," costs."
"13462180","13466040"," They tend to not have some secret sauce that's all that impressive. "
"13466640","13470800"," There's some regression to the mean going on that activist investors tend to get involved in"
"13470800","13473360"," companies that have had a couple of tough years."
"13473360","13478300"," And so they come on the board and wave their towel around their head for a couple of months and"
"13478300","13480640"," then the stock does better when there wasn't really causality."
"13480960","13484840"," I don't mean to be dismissive because there are some companies that aren't maximizing shareholder"
"13484840","13491600"," value, but I would tend to say that activist investors don't always add the value that they claim. "
"13491760","13494680"," One more I'm just going to throw at you because we're showing it on the screen and we'll talk about"
"13494680","13495460"," the market more broadly."
"13496740","13502600"," We've talked about entertainment stocks and your take kind of on live events versus post pandemic"
"13502600","13503360"," and the value there."
"13503800","13505580"," Do you have a dog in that fight?"
"13505760","13506980"," Are you kind of waiting to see what happens?"
"13508220","13512500"," Full disclosure, as you know, Melody Hops and our CEO is married to George Lucas. "
"13512700","13515360"," And so we do have an absolute dog in this fight."
"13516180","13519420"," So it's a wonderful company whose stock has been halved."
"13519520","13522040"," Obviously there are two core franchises in. "
"13522620","13528460"," Remember that we're coming into the funky hour of 130 at 20 minutes rolling into this 20 minutes"
"13528460","13528700"," here."
"13529140","13531840"," This is where they like to freak people out."
"13532120","13534900"," This is where you get the manipulation in the market during the day. "
"13535520","13538980"," Just be aware of that 130 bear time of the day."
"13543150","13547190"," Which has faced some challenges is going to be fine along with not just saying that."
"13547850","13548770"," Not just saying. "
"13549170","13550790"," All right, let me ask you about the markets."
"13550790","13554350"," The Dow a moment ago just went positive on the session S&P and Nasjak are higher."
"13554810","13557210"," Finally, a bit of a change in sentiment. "
"13557490","13558850"," It was a bad start to the year."
"13559010","13563830"," And I think depending on how today goes, the January indicator would tell us that maybe the whole"
"13563830","13564970"," year we could be lower."
"13565270","13567250"," So perhaps you're right that there's been too much optimism. "
"13568670","13575190"," Yeah, one of his quotes that I love is you pay a big price for a cheery consensus."
"13575790","13579010"," And I do think we went into this year and I said this to you right before Christmas."
"13579010","13584250"," We went from a lot of pessimism, a lot of certainty that we were going to have a recession to"
"13584250","13585470"," a lot of optimism. "
"13585690","13590330"," And there was way too much consensus that there's not going to be a recession that interest rates"
"13590330","13592570"," are going to drop and that the stock market is going to do well."
"13593250","13598710"," I happen to generally think that consensus is right, but it always makes me a little nervous when"
"13598710","13599430"," everybody is optimistic."
"13600230","13603050"," Things can still go wrong often for reasons that we don't expect. "
"13603050","13604550"," I'm personally worried about China."
"13605270","13607730"," China's real essential real estate collapse."
"13608930","13610750"," China's possible blockade of Taiwan. "
"13611170","13612890"," I think there's still bad things that can happen."
"13613250","13615930"," So there is a little too much optimism for my liking."
"13616070","13620510"," Maybe, Charlie, you can defend me a little bit because I was tweeting earlier today about the need"
"13620510","13621210"," for rate cuts. "
"13621290","13626990"," Yes, it was after the New York Fed consumer inflation expectations came out there back to normal."
"13627010","13629110"," So kind of that event risk has passed."
"13629310","13631270"," We know what's been going on with the broader inflation data. "
"13631270","13638050"," And the main kind of response to that is, no, no, no, no, if we cut rates, inflation is going"
"13638050","13638970"," to pick back up again."
"13639210","13640290"," How could you want that?"
"13640870","13643210"," But I think you're kind of in the rate cut camp too."
"13643390","13644450"," Can you just explain that?"
"13645110","13650350"," We have had one of the first drops in the money supply over the last 18 months. "
"13650930","13656830"," And after a spectacular increase with the Fed flooding the economy with cash, they've actually been"
"13656830","13658770"," taking money out of the economy."
"13658770","13663490"," And we've had a decline in the amount of cash in the economy."
"13663670","13666950"," And that is producing a return to more normal rates of inflation. "
"13667070","13670470"," We're not going to get down to 2% this year, but I think we're going to get under three."
"13670870","13675270"," And that gives us a much more level normal rate of inflation."
"13675670","13682290"," And one of the most important laws in finance is that the rate, the real rate of return, the"
"13682290","13687250"," interest rate above inflation is relatively constant at one to one and a half percent. "
"13687250","13692610"," So when you have, let's call it a two and a half percent inflation rate, you really should only"
"13692610","13695730"," have about a 4% risk free rate."
"13696010","13697730"," And so interest rates were too high."
"13698290","13700070"," They were ridiculously low at zero. "
"13700530","13703050"," Now they've come down to about where they should be."
"13703270","13708230"," And if the inflation keeps coming down, the Fed should drop interest rates."
"13708250","13710050"," And I think that's the most likely path. "
"13710410","13711350"," Yeah, it sounds reasonable."
"13711630","13712370"," It's not crazy."
"13712590","13715070"," It doesn't mean inflation is going to suddenly pick back up again. "
"13715070","13719110"," If anything, you know, it could be better for bond yields in the long run on a better economy."
"13719430","13720510"," Charlie, we'll leave it there for now."
"13720730","13722570"," Hope to pick it back up sometime soon. "
"13722910","13725650"," I appreciate your time joining me from Ariel Investments."
"13726490","13728170"," I mentioned all the health care deals."
"13728170","13731090"," Check out shares of Novartis and SIDO kinetics right now. "
"13731370","13735110"," Moving in opposite directions, the last few moments as the Wall Street Journal reports that"
"13735110","13737630"," Novartis is nearing a deal to buy SIDO kinetics."
"13737810","13739270"," Now Novartis is only fractionally lower."
"13739670","13741110"," The report says the deal could be finalized. "
"13741110","13746510"," As soon as this week, no details yet on potential price or other terms, but CYTK shares are popping"
"13746510","13747890"," 16%."
"13747890","13749450"," It's been super busy on this front lately."
"13749990","13753530"," Speaking of which, one of the biggest health care events of the year is taking place in California"
"13753530","13754250"," this week. "
"13754610","13759890"," JP Morgan's conference coming at a time of increased deal making and tons of debate over the impact"
"13759890","13764670"," of those new weight loss drugs, something they could lessen demand for procedures like hip and knee"
"13764670","13769330"," replacements going forward ahead when for the medical device makers and shares of Medtronic are"
"13769330","13773150"," coming off a three year string of declines after surging during the pandemic."
"13773150","13775550"," They're up about 13% the last three months though."
"13775910","13778070"," How is the company responding to all of these challenges?"
"13778790","13780970"," Let's get out to CNBC's very own Jim Kramer. "
"13781330","13784170"," He's at the JP Morgan Health Care Conference with Medtronics CEO."
"13784670","13785270"," Jim, over to you."
"13786650","13788030"," Oh, thank you so much, Kelly. "
"13788330","13791670"," I've got Jeff more than he's going to go right to this issue about GOP one."
"13791670","13798670"," You are very upfront about the idea that there may not be nearly as much impact for diabetes and"
"13798670","13800290"," cardiovascular as people are thinking."
"13800770","13800870"," All right. "
"13801250","13802870"," Well, first of all, thanks for having me, Jim."
"13802970","13803630"," It's great to be here."
"13804070","13807350"," Yeah, on the topic as you've been once, first of all, I said, look, these are important new"
"13807350","13813770"," classical drugs for patients and having a big impact, but when it comes to the other disease states"
"13813770","13819850"," and medical devices, we've done the work from an epidemiology standpoint, as well as looking at"
"13819850","13821850"," different scenarios of penetration of GOP ones. "
"13821970","13824110"," So we just don't think, we don't, we feel strong."
"13824250","13827990"," It's not going to affect our growth rates or our addressable market near term or long term."
"13828370","13829170"," Now, it is true. "
"13829290","13833050"," Also, you talk about the gold standard, which is still built bariatric surgery for people who are"
"13833050","13835430"," bariobese, which is where the comorbidities come from."
"13836030","13836110"," Right."
"13836110","13836310"," Right. "
"13836690","13839930"," I mean, look, the area is the people question us about about GOP ones."
"13840070","13840470"," We'd be diabetes."
"13841370","13842610"," Bariatric surgery is one of those. "
"13843110","13847710"," And in the, in, we've had a, it's a small portion of our business, a small slowdown there, but over"
"13847710","13851530"," time, what we're hearing from bariatric surgeons is these GOP ones are actually increasing our"
"13851530","13857550"," funnel as it brings, you know, bariobese patients to make them less obese and safer for surgery."
"13858050","13861950"," Well, let's talk about what I regard as almost the new Medtronic, because you're doing so many"
"13861950","13862230"," things."
"13862910","13869070"," One of the biggest sources of, frankly, of fatality of death is hypertension. "
"13869590","13869590"," Right."
"13869850","13872950"," And yet people have kind of forgotten about it, yet the drugs really don't work."
"13873410","13876590"," People are kind of unaware about it, even though you get your blood pressure, you go to doctor,"
"13876730","13883250"," you've got the first new thing that might be able to solve this incredibly important disease. "
"13883790","13883890"," Right."
"13884030","13885270"," Well, we're really excited about this."
"13885330","13891230"," It's been 15 years in the making and a huge investment, but we just got to have the approval for"
"13891230","13899690"," our simplicity system, which basically is a procedural based solution that lowers patient's"
"13899690","13900030"," hypertension. "
"13900630","13901750"," And it lowers it."
"13901930","13903550"," We've got data going on 10 years."
"13904170","13906430"," So it doesn't reverse. "
"13907110","13909570"," And there's no, we've had no safety issues."
"13910110","13914690"," And it's, we've seen consistently lower blood pressure, about 10 millimeters of mercury."
"13915430","13921150"," Even a small like three or four drop is like a 40% decrease in stroke and heart attack. "
"13921250","13923570"," So this, we think, could be the biggest thing our company's ever done."
"13923570","13926950"," I think this is fantastic because I've been waiting and waiting, you made it in that position."
"13927550","13929570"," But the fact is it's got a novel mechanism. "
"13930090","13935050"," And that's why I think that not a pill, but one time only day procedure."
"13936270","13939010"," I think, you know, positions feel comfortable doing this."
"13939710","13944870"," And the patients we've talked to, they, you know, they walk out of the hospital and they don't feel"
"13944870","13945190"," any pain. "
"13945410","13945790"," Fantastic."
"13946070","13950730"," Now you also, you're a company that frankly had a good course, but now you're doing something"
"13950730","13952570"," almost weekly today."
"13953470","13958070"," Your neuro stimulator, this is something people have been wondering, what can be done for"
"13958070","13958650"," Parkinson's?"
"13958730","13958830"," Right. "
"13959210","13961850"," What can be done for essential tremors?"
"13962070","13962430"," You've got something."
"13962810","13962910"," Right."
"13963430","13967290"," So we look for deep brain stimulation has been around for a while. "
"13967430","13969370"," We invented it 20 some years ago."
"13969830","13972750"," And what we're trying to do now is make this more of a mainstream therapy."
"13973190","13975290"," The brain, as you know, Jim, is still a white space. "
"13975830","13980510"," And our latest system and the system that got approved today is just another version of our system"
"13980510","13981710"," that has sensing in it."
"13981710","13986050"," So today we have a commercially available product for Parkinson's and essential tremor that does,"
"13986290","13988350"," it's works magic for these patients."
"13988890","13994250"," But in addition to that therapeutic effect, we are now recording signals in the brain and we are"
"13994250","13995630"," going to learn so much about the brain. "
"13995830","14002910"," So just even just in late 2023 in September or so, nature, which is a very big medical journal in"
"14002910","14007930"," our space up there with New England Journal of Medicine, said using our technology, this one"
"14007930","14011290"," particular physician identified a biomarker for depression."
"14011770","14017110"," I just got off the phone over holiday with an East Coast University and they're telling me they"
"14017110","14018990"," found a biomarker for addiction."
"14019370","14023830"," All using our system that is recording signals in the brain, which Jim is very hard to do. "
"14023950","14026830"," It's taken us over a decade to figure this out and we're the only ones that have it."
"14026910","14028530"," Well, it's quick because the brain, you're right."
"14028730","14028970"," It's okay. "
"14029550","14030530"," You're doing something right now."
"14030530","14035310"," With NVIDIA, you're doing AI with NVIDIA and it's very important for patients."
"14036330","14041730"," Yeah, so look, in today's world, I think the amount of data you have is going to be your currency"
"14041730","14042330"," for innovation. "
"14042650","14048490"," There's lots of advances in biomedical engineering, but data is going to be how the ceiling, the"
"14048490","14050910"," more data we have, the better quality data we have, the more we're going to innovate."
"14050910","14056730"," And so what we've done with NVIDIA, we've put in basically edge computers inside interventional"
"14056730","14064530"," suites and inside of surgery suites to record everything that's going on there and provide in the"
"14064530","14071710"," moment real-time benefits like in our colonoscopy business, real-time AI processing right there on"
"14071710","14073060"," the edge to identify polyps."
"14073660","14078940"," What we found in colonoscopy is a very mature segment that up to 50% of polyps are being missed. "
"14079380","14081480"," No one would have thought of that and then the AI is finding it."
"14081900","14086400"," And then where I'm really excited is in surgical suites as we're trying to democratize good"
"14086400","14086820"," surgery."
"14087440","14093000"," We're building the algorithms using these edge computers and we'll eventually deliver these into"
"14093000","14096080"," the OR that's providing, think about driver assist technology in the OR. "
"14096440","14099560"," We're not going to be replacing surgeons anytime soon, but we're going to make them better."
"14099560","14104260"," And surgeons that are using this AI technology are going to be replacing surgeons that don't."

"14113360","14115720"," We certainly benefit from a smaller pacemaker."
"14115900","14117340"," Yeah, so this is it. "
"14117480","14119040"," This is the micro pacemaker."
"14119700","14125640"," You know, we first launched this and in 2015, it covered maybe 15% of traditional pacing"
"14125640","14126640"," indications."
"14126640","14128260"," We just launched some new versions. "
"14128420","14130100"," You saw the approval last week."
"14130160","14133160"," Now we're up to about half and it's really Jim."
"14133480","14137660"," What this has done is it's helped us gain market share, but more importantly, it's growing the"

"14138440","14140320"," Our pacing business is now growing."
"14140480","14144780"," It's a three and a half, four billion to our business growing high single digits because our"
"14144780","14148560"," innovation is lowered the threshold for patients to get pacing."
"14149140","14152860"," So we've reind, we've disrupted ourselves and really rejuvenated this market. "
"14152860","14157240"," Well, I've got to tell you, Jeff, it's great to hear Medtronic doing all these very exciting"
"14157240","14157520"," things."
"14157540","14158360"," It's really important."

"14166680","14168980"," Wonderful interview Jim and it's busy out there."
"14169180","14171000"," Every time I turn around, there's more deal making. "
"14171280","14174180"," You think that's because of the conference or is just the space in general?"
"14174400","14175400"," There's just a lot going on."
"14175880","14176040"," Yes!"
"14176780","14179560"," Kelly, this has been a place that a lot of people get deals done."
"14179560","14183920"," And by the way, there are people who get deals done and we don't know it for several weeks or"
"14183920","14184220"," months. "
"14184600","14188140"," Right, but everybody's together and I've got to tell you, I think I'll go do a couple deals myself"
"14188140","14188580"," on that."
"14189880","14191320"," Just give us the exclusive note."
"14191580","14192520"," Jim, thank you very much. "
"14192620","14193220"," We appreciate it."
"14193620","14196140"," As always, CNBC's Jim Kramer, Medtronic's Jeff Martha."
"14196680","14199320"," Coming up, we have a deal to avoid a shutdown next Friday. "

"14216760","14220920"," As we head to break, here's a glance at Market's Dow ever so slightly and briefly turned positive."
"14221220","14224820"," But we're down six points while the SMP and NASDAQ are in much firmer ground."
"14225100","14226500"," The exchange is back after that. "
"14230420","14233260"," This is the exchange on CNBC."
"14391190","14392530"," Welcome back to the exchange."
"14393070","14396610"," Top congressional leaders have reached a government spending deal for the moment. "
"14397110","14400470"," Emily Wilkins is in Washington with its details and likelihood of passage."
"14400790","14400910"," Emily."
"14401750","14402510"," Hey, Kelly. "
"14402770","14406610"," Well, yeah, shut down fears eased over the weekend after congressional leaders struck a deal"
"14406610","14407050"," yesterday."
"14407510","14411510"," And this is on the overall spending number for the current fiscal year."
"14411690","14413150"," So it's 1.6 trillion. "
"14413150","14417250"," And it reflects the agreement that Congress and the White House reached last June over the debt"
"14417250","14420370"," limit plus the side deal to increase non-defense spending."
"14420930","14425290"," Now, Speaker Mike Johnson was able to negotiate several cuts of previously allocated funding."
"14425770","14430610"," He's going to be rescinding 6 billion in COVID emergency funding and additional 10 billion in cuts"
"14430610","14434670"," for the IRS this year, bringing total cuts for the agency to 20 billion. "
"14435050","14440010"," But while Johnson got Democrats to agree to the cuts, it is not enough for hard-line conservatives"
"14440010","14441050"," in his party."
"14441050","14446610"," The House Freedom Caucus called the bill a quote, total failure for not doing more to reduce"
"14446610","14447070"," spending."
"14447590","14451790"," In a dear colleague letter, Johnson acknowledged that the plan would likely not satisfy everyone,"
"14452230","14455650"," but vowed to fight to attach additional conservative priorities to the bill. "
"14455950","14460730"," Now, Johnson didn't specify which priorities he pushed for, but measures House Republicans passed"
"14460730","14463790"," in previous bills would fail in a Democratic-controlled Senate."
"14464070","14467710"," That's going to make any want to be additions to the spending bills difficult."
"14467710","14472290"," And now that overall spending is agreed to, the House and Senate, they still have a lot of work to"
"14472290","14472410"," do. "
"14472510","14477610"," They got to reconcile 120 billion in differences between the House spending bills and the Senate"
"14477610","14478290"," spending bills."
"14478710","14483330"," How quickly that process moves will determine whether or not the government goes into a partial"
"14483330","14485250"," shutdown on January 20th."
"14485470","14485650"," Kelly?"
"14485950","14486370"," All right. "
"14486590","14488350"," We'll take it as it is for the time being Emily."
"14488590","14488710"," Thanks."
"14489070","14492950"," We're also a week out from the Iowa caucus that kicks election season into high gear. "
"14492950","14497290"," And while everyone says election years are generally good for the market, my next guest warns the"
"14497290","14501550"," path can be a little rocky, and the key is whether we end up with a divided versus a unified"
"14501550","14502050"," government."
"14502430","14503670"," For more, let's bring in Dirk Willer."
"14503810","14506350"," He's global head of macro and emerging market strategy at city. "
"14506910","14507630"," Dirk, it's good to see you."
"14507750","14507930"," Welcome."
"14508830","14510110"," Thanks a lot for having me, Kelly. "
"14510390","14512630"," What surprised you most as you dug through the data here?"
"14514410","14517830"," Yeah, I think it's the big picture call this is true."
"14518030","14521070"," It is positive for equities the election years."
"14521070","14527370"," And I think what's interesting, though, is that on a more tactical basis, a few months before the"
"14527370","14531430"," election, the market often pulls back, puts him a little bit of recipient in the price. "
"14531970","14534730"," And that is usually unbound and after the election."
"14534950","14539730"," And in a sense, the interesting thing is that the US elections these days behave almost like the"
"14539730","14544150"," image of market elections, where a lot of recipient was put into the market before the election."
"14544390","14545570"," That's it's taking it afterwards. "
"14545850","14547670"," So that is an interesting pattern."
"14547670","14550750"," Let me make sure before you move on that people caught that he said."
"14551250","14555130"," The interesting thing is that the US elections are behaving like emerging market elections. "
"14555510","14557770"," I think people would sometimes agree with you in more ways than one."
"14558290","14558750"," Exactly."
"14559190","14563510"," So, but it has been the case for a while, actually, not just since 2016. "
"14564610","14567790"," That in the big picture, it's a good year for the S&P."
"14568790","14573610"," More technically, you know, at the end of the summer, markets get choppy and that choppiness gets"
"14573610","14575230"," unbound once the election happens."
"14575230","14579750"," What are the clearest trades people could write down now and use as we move throughout the year?"
"14579850","14581090"," Because some of them are a little quirky. "
"14581350","14585370"," I mean, you've got utilities in there, some community, some other sectors, things like that."
"14585510","14587550"," The dollar is one clear one."
"14587730","14588810"," And there's like four different outcomes. "
"14589070","14593490"," I mean, listen, I'm not a political expert, but as far as I can see, we could have unified"
"14593490","14600190"," Republican, unified Democrat, split GOP president, Democratic Congress, and vice versa."
"14600530","14602270"," All of this seems to be on the table right now."
"14602270","14607250"," So what are the clearest ones that for you have obvious trades people could put on?"
"14607690","14612970"," Yeah, the unified Democrats is probably the least likely just because the Senate math is really"
"14612970","14613810"," favoring the Republicans. "
"14614530","14620110"," And so two out of the three potential outcomes are actually a divided government, which is the best"
"14620110","14620590"," for the market."
"14620810","14623410"," So in the big picture, it's broad and positive."
"14623770","14628990"," But if you go one level below that, the election obviously rhymes a little bit with 2016. "
"14629510","14632830"," And some things will be very similar to 2016, some are really different."
"14633770","14636790"," The things that will be similar is that we do see dollar strength again."
"14637810","14643930"," And that is partially because we see the risk of more fiscal spending and we see the risk of"
"14643930","14646250"," tariffs and both of the Polish. "
"14646550","14653150"," I don't think it'll be as bad as for the Mexican peso as it was in 2016, but broadly speaking,"
"14653530","14654070"," dollar Polishness."
"14654870","14658950"," We also remember 2016, we saw weaker treasuries."
"14659550","14663850"," This time, I think that might again happen, but in a steeply context because the Fed was to be"
"14663850","14664630"," cutting at the time. "
"14665030","14666390"," Probably when the election was around."
"14666670","14669410"," So it's not an outright result of what is steep a curve."
"14670390","14678390"," And then if you go on the sector level, and the clear trades are usually that Republicans favor. "
"14678390","14681010"," They were oil energy."
"14682110","14686590"," But in 2016, it also was very strong for financials and industrials."
"14687010","14688290"," And that could again play out that way. "
"14689070","14692370"," Democrats, of course, health care would perform the best."
"14692690","14698370"," So I think on the sector level, you have to choose a little bit what your potential outcome really"
"14698370","14698710"," is."
"14699270","14703790"," But I think in terms of the risk, the market will trade going into the election. "
"14704230","14706350"," I think the risk would be a triumphant end up."
"14706450","14710390"," So therefore, you could see industrials and financials doing better than health care."
"14710490","14711470"," Quick last question, Dirk. "
"14711590","14712870"," Let me turn all of this on its head."
"14713030","14718230"," Now that you've looked at all these playbooks for recent election cycles, does the trading data yet"
"14718230","14722170"," tell you that the market is anticipating one certain outcome here?"
"14722970","14728150"," It's very early, but I mean that a lot of the patterns are described to start to work out a"
"14728150","14729210"," few months before the election."
"14729810","14732110"," And then the programs are clear up. "
"14732390","14738610"," And so I think at this stage, you know, the market, I think the biggest figure from marketers, that"
"14738610","14741290"," it's believing into self-landing and not a recession."
"14741630","14745550"," That's probably a bigger call that you can suss out right now for market behavior than how the"
"14745550","14746810"," election will will pan out."
"14747250","14751810"," But I think by the end of the summer, the election will be front and center, and then you will"
"14751810","14753830"," be able to draw much from the conclusion so forth. "
"14754050","14756050"," And I think it's believing about the outcome."
"14756370","14756570"," All right."
"14756610","14757430"," We will check back in. "
"14757430","14758570"," And a few months time, Dirk."
"14758750","14759170"," Thanks very much."
"14759170","14759810"," We appreciate it. "

"15299820","15301400"," Joining me now is Simeon Siegel."
"15301600","15303200"," He's an analyst with BMO Capital Markets. "
"15303980","15306940"," Simeon, if only everyone would do a note like this."
"15307180","15312400"," I just, I love hearing about the nuances in terms of the top level rate cuts we talk about and"
"15312400","15313820"," the impact on your coverage universe."
"15314020","15314740"," So what jumps out?"
"15315700","15316840"," Hey, Kelly, good to see you. "
"15316960","15320860"," So listen, I think everyone here has rate cuts and they think, okay, companies and people will have"
"15320860","15323000"," more money in their wallets and therefore everything is great."
"15323000","15327760"," The problem is, if you think about it from a corporate perspective, the rate cuts help those who"
"15327760","15331660"," need money and a lot of retailers are cash rich posts, the pandemic."
"15332220","15337160"," And so what we look for was we look for, okay, growth businesses that need money and growth stocks"
"15337160","15338780"," that are valued accordingly. "
"15339900","15344440"," Companies that are heavily in debt stand to benefit, but oddly enough, the healthiest businesses,"
"15344820","15348820"," the ones that have been building up their balance sheets and have watched like you and I, your"
"15348820","15351960"," personal ability to generate cash, the savings on cash go up."
"15351960","15353240"," Those will see pressure."
"15354020","15358060"," And so what we found, we found, so you mentioned earlier, Birkenstock, lifetime, planet fitness. "
"15358300","15361760"," We saw these businesses that actually stand to benefit pretty tremendously across various different"
"15361760","15362880"," angles."
"15363660","15366620"," Those are going to be the ones that are going to benefit from a rate cut and explain it before"
"15366620","15368500"," you go from there."
"15369300","15371220"," And, you know, most people's minds wouldn't go. "
"15371700","15372780"," Rate cuts, Birkenstocks."
"15373140","15375500"," Why does that company in particular jump out to you as a beneficiary?"
"15376640","15385540"," So the way we were thinking about it, we looked for businesses that were growing faster because if"
"15385540","15389360"," you think about it, growing faster needs the ability, cost of capital going down will help that"
"15389360","15389660"," growth."
"15390080","15396140"," But also what a multiple is, what a forward multiple is on growth, is what that discount, what are"
"15396140","15397320"," the present values worth today. "
"15398000","15401420"," And so if I lower my interest rate, then my discount value goes down to present value."
"15401420","15403020"," Those cash is worth more now."
"15403440","15407360"," That's very different than companies that have multiples that are not based on future value. "
"15407520","15408440"," They're just based on consistency."
"15409020","15413320"," And so in stock is both a growth stock and a growth company like others in my."
"15414040","15417200"," And the reality is having debt in this scenario helps. "
"15417760","15421000"," Not because having debt is great, but because having debt was expensive."
"15421480","15425300"," And so when it was variable and we watched a lot of companies see that funding costs continue to"
"15425300","15425620"," rise."
"15426000","15426140"," Exactly. "
"15426380","15427960"," If you help me, it's going to come down."
"15428280","15429060"," That's a relief point."
"15429520","15431560"," And you also put lifetime fitness in that category. "
"15431560","15433020"," Is that because it's capital intensive?"
"15433020","15438740"," And they're actually so the third bucket, which is a little bit lazy, was our miscellaneous bucket."
"15438960","15441200"," It was who as who has other left, who's leverage to financing."
"15441860","15445480"," And so a company like lifetime, which is working on potential sale lease facts, sees a benefit"
"15445480","15450860"," there that had been a pressure company like Planet Fitness as an army of franchisees that need to"
"15450860","15454300"," tap financing to build units is another one of these miscellaneous buckets. "
"15454740","15456300"," And so it's just, it's this idea."
"15456460","15456720"," It's funny."
"15456860","15460320"," It's counterintuitive because it's the businesses that otherwise were hurt. "
"15460320","15464240"," So this is that theoretically looked less healthy that all of a sudden now."
"15464560","15464740"," Totally."
"15465120","15467080"," And no, and I think that makes sense on some level. "
"15467380","15470740"," Let me ask you then, you were sort of saying, look, as we go through this, there might be a"
"15470740","15474040"," lot of companies that are adversely affected."
"15474560","15475680"," Who are they and why?"
"15476780","15477140"," Yeah."
"15477300","15481500"," So the similar following that counterintuitive part, and I want to be clear because I'm about to"
"15481500","15482300"," knock good companies. "
"15482480","15483300"," Like that's what this is."
"15483300","15489580"," This was, this note was a let's look at what's isolated, very specific factor as opposed to let's"
"15489580","15494100"," look at the health of the businesses, because what happened in December were stocks moved, not tied"
"15494100","15494680"," to numbers."
"15495180","15496540"," They were tied to the rate of conversation. "
"15497260","15502120"," And so what my team tried to do is we tried to isolate stock movements that went too far versus"
"15502120","15503200"," once they didn't go far enough."
"15503640","15506940"," And so, for example, our math was last quarter gap."
"15507600","15508880"," Ross doors and Ralph Lauren. "
"15509300","15511840"," So a tremendous lifts from that cash yield."
"15511840","15516360"," When you're generating so such a return on cash, you watched a number that used to be interest"
"15516360","15518700"," income turn interest expense turn to interest income."
"15519160","15520300"," And that's been boosting EBS. "
"15521000","15527620"," And so if that were to diminish the value that you'd get by saving on your cost of borrowing versus"
"15527620","15531660"," what you'll lose from that free money that cash has given you could actually wait and earn it."
"15531680","15535000"," It doesn't impact the event doesn't impact the fundamentals of the business."
"15535000","15540000"," But we've been these businesses that trade on profitability if they trade on EBS, they've gotten"
"15540000","15540540"," that lift. "
"15541180","15542320"," And I think they've gotten it quietly."
"15542640","15545340"," I don't know the people fully appreciated how much earnings have been boosted."
"15545720","15550960"," We've seen anywhere from low single digit to low double digit equivalent of an even number from"
"15550960","15552480"," interest income to big with. "
"15552860","15553980"," That's really interesting."
"15553980","15558000"," So basically, and there's a lot of the public out there who sort of has enjoyed."
"15558000","15561960"," Yes, you know, they don't want inflation, but they've been making money on their savings in a way"
"15561960","15564820"," that they never did previously and that's been true for corporate America as well. "
"15564820","15566600"," And, and all of a sudden that's going to go away."
"15567940","15572920"," Yeah, and listen, like I think even like it's by not all of a sudden going to go away, but"
"15572920","15575240"," it's all about the incremental it's all about that second derivative."
"15575800","15581600"," And so what we did what was fun in this report was we created a scatter plot where we just"
"15581600","15587020"," matched stock movements in December versus this who we think will benefit versus not because. "
"15587020","15588820"," Listen, I don't know."
"15588820","15589840"," I'm not knowing you're smart enough."
"15589900","15593720"," I'm not going to pretend to call whether and when and how far interest rates are going to go. "
"15594100","15595980"," But it does seem like that's going to be a conversation."
"15596160","15599880"," I think you and I are going to be talking about this over the year where we're just going to"
"15599880","15604580"," have to figure out, did things get better or worse for these companies because they traded on that"
"15604580","15605580"," second derivative on the way up."
"15605680","15607180"," No, and there's more granularity in the note. "
"15607200","15611420"," I think it's interesting, not just for retail, but as a microcosm of how other industries could be"
"15611420","15617000"," affected as well, both positive and negative."
"15617000","15618540"," Simien Siegel with BMO."

"15892780","15895560"," devices as well could be the Apple Watch instead of the cloud."
"15895880","15899940"," And remember that Apple has an installed base of more than two billion."

"16164750","16169730"," Even now some of the interferences we're facing in terms of getting shipments around the world."
"16170110","16171650"," What's the biggest segment of your business?"
"16172750","16176110"," The biggest segment of our business is our manufacturing operation."
"16176110","16180410"," And you're right, we have three manufacturing locations in Mexico. "
"16180910","16186450"," We have several manufacturing locations here in the United States, but also in Europe, in Poland"

"16189330","16194350"," So talk a little bit about what you're experiencing on that front at a time when we know that the"
"16194350","16198610"," manufacturing segment of the economy has been a negative territory for quite some time."
"16199730","16204290"," Yeah, it's a really great question because there are so many different layers to this. "
"16204910","16210590"," Part of the reason why we have had some difficulty with manufacturing is just being able to get a"
"16210590","16211810"," good, sustainable workforce."
"16212530","16215990"," We're willing to train people to come and do work, but it's hard work."
"16216250","16222410"," And so this is where to your point at the opening there, the issues on the border crossing are"
"16222410","16226390"," really top of mind for me, as well as many others in the rail industry. "
"16227210","16227890"," Explain that."
"16228030","16229310"," What are you experiencing these days?"
"16230330","16237750"," Well, thankfully, Greenbrier has not had any significant issues yet in getting equipment out of"
"16237750","16239490"," Mexico into the U.S. market."
"16240090","16242890"," But we also are a big customer of the railroads. "
"16242930","16248790"," We use the railroad to move our inventory into Mexico in order to be able to build our rail cars."
"16249350","16256810"," So having these unannounced, indeterminate closures of rail crossings is a really critical issue."
"16256810","16261450"," And it's not just about my business, Greenbrier. "
"16261710","16266870"," It is about the overall economy because there is so much commerce that moves across that border."
"16267430","16269550"," Mexico is our number one trade partner."
"16270170","16274170"," And to have just the borders closed is crazy. "
"16274450","16279770"," Think about it when you're driving down the highway and someone up ahead throws their foot on the"
"16279770","16281950"," brakes and that backs traffic up."
"16281950","16286370"," Yeah, traffic doesn't start flowing again just whenever they take their foot off the brake, right?"
"16286590","16290590"," It's going to take time whenever they have these closures to get things moving freely again."
"16290830","16296850"," And we spoke with the industry trade group for rail maybe a week or two ago about the situation. "
"16297590","16298770"," He was obviously frustrated."
"16299170","16301110"," So it sounds like we're still at an impasse."
"16301270","16302790"," Have you gotten any guidance from the administration?"
"16304430","16306890"," We continue to talk to our policymakers again. "
"16306890","16311590"," We work with the railroads, customers, our competitors, trying to get that."
"16311970","16317550"," They are really focused on how they deal with the migration issue."
"16318090","16323970"," I really do hope that the policymakers in DC can find a way to set aside their differences and"
"16323970","16326450"," think about how we can solve this problem. "
"16326690","16327810"," It's a great country."
"16328390","16332310"," There are people down there that want to come into our country to have a better life to work hard."
"16332310","16337590"," So how do we sort through that as opposed to it just being a political issue?"
"16337890","16341850"," And why do you think your shares have held up because if the shares were down 50% for instance"
"16341850","16346850"," and saying it was true for the whole industry, I'm sure there'd be more impetus for action. "
"16348110","16348970"," That's a great point."
"16349150","16353710"," I would say that our shares are up because we've at the leadership team here, we've been doing what"

"16533820","16536960"," It's just the latest problem for the 737 MAX series. "
"16537259","16542340"," And is it just another one-off unfortunate band or a bigger black eye for the company and the"
"16542340","16543200"," management team there?"
"16543580","16547140"," Excluding the bowing impact, shots are actually higher across the board."
"16547500","16550759"," In fact, even with the bowing pullback, the Dow has turned positive."
"16551000","16556160"," So where last week's declines, just a healthy pullback and what is still a strong market or a"
"16556160","16556820"," rallying one. "
"16556960","16557919"," Here are the numbers right now."
"16558060","16559939"," Bowing is costing the Dow about 100 points."
"16560599","16564220"," But it's up 23 while the NASDAQ is up almost 1% right now. "
"16564619","16569560"," And then the S&P is, I should say, the NASDAQ is up 1.7% as it continues a"
"16569560","16570460"," strong session tie."
"16570460","16572640"," Plus, more pharma deals to tell you about."
"16572820","16577300"," Merck in talks now to buy harpoon therapeutics for $23 a share. "
"16577520","16579099"," The move would boost its cancer portfolio."
"16580000","16583900"," And Johnson & Johnson will buy Ambrex BioPharma for about $2 billion."
"16584680","16587040"," Ambrex is also working on cancer therapies. "
"16587779","16593119"," And shares of cyto-kinetics are popping intraday as the Wall Street Journal reports Novartis is in"
"16593119","16594480"," talks to buy the company."
"16594860","16597880"," They're up as much as 16%, about 13.5% higher."
"16597880","16602279"," Now the company has been going through a sale process, so there remains the possibility of other"
"16602279","16605500"," bidders interesting and they're interested in their promising heart drug. "
"16605720","16608560"," But we start with the leading story of the day and the weekend."
"16608919","16616380"," Boeing shares down sharply today after a door plug blew out mid-flight on a 737 MAX-9."
"16616779","16620880"," The FAA ordering dozens of those planes to be grounded and inspected. "
"16620900","16623640"," And let's bring in Phil LeBoe now for more."
"16623820","16624540"," What's the latest Phil?"
"16626020","16630439"," Tyler, as this investigation continues, really there's going in two tracks right now."
"16630580","16633860"," You've got the NTSB investigation into the incident itself. "
"16633960","16638960"," And let's start first off with that part of the piece of the latest news today."
"16639279","16644919"," The NTSB investigators not only looking at the plane, that is part of the airport in Portland, but"
"16644919","16651140"," also at the fuselage plug, which was recovered in a neighborhood outside of Portland that was blown"
"16651140","16651939"," off of the plane."
"16651939","16654960"," The FAA, meanwhile, that's the other part of this. "
"16655259","16659740"," It has approved the inspection process that it worked on with Boeing."
"16660140","16660759"," What is that?"
"16661119","16664880"," That allows them to say to airlines who have grounded planes."
"16665200","16671660"," Okay, if you meet these inspection protocols, if everything on their matches, those grounded planes"
"16671660","16672900"," are closer to resuming flight. "
"16673140","16677939"," I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see some grounded MAX-9's re-enter service tomorrow."
"16677939","16683320"," In terms of the number of planes that are out there, that are grounded, that have been built by"
"16683320","16688060"," Boeing, you have 218 MAX-9's, 171 of them grounded around the world."
"16688480","16694320"," United has 79, Alaska 65, by far they have the most of any airline in the world. "
"16694640","16696020"," Those two have the most of all the airlines."
"16696759","16700599"," Six other foreign airlines have 74 MAX-9's."
"16701220","16704140"," United and Alaska are feeling the ripple effect of this. "
"16704140","16711779"," Today, United canceling more flights, not just because of the MAX-9, many of these are MAX-9, but"
"16711779","16714520"," the ripple effect 228 flights cancel today."
"16715000","16716779"," For Alaska, it's a similar situation."
"16717439","16722040"," Not only have they pulled those MAX-9's out of service, so you have flights there canceled, but the"
"16722040","16724880"," ripple effect means 143 flights canceled today. "
"16725200","16730320"," And again, don't be surprised if we start to see some of these MAX-9's re-entering service tomorrow"
"16730320","16734160"," or the day after these inspections take place."
"16734640","16735300"," A couple other things."
"16735599","16740480"," As you take a look at this from the perspective of Boeing shareholder, the question becomes, what"
"16740480","16743140"," does this mean for Boeing MAX production?"
"16743640","16749759"," Dave Calhoun, the CEO, will be holding a Tay Safety Town Hall at the rent and plant in Washington. "
"16750300","16751400"," That will happen tomorrow."
"16751820","16756400"," The focus will be on building the safest planes possible, making sure that they're doing exactly"
"16756400","16761439"," what they should be doing and that they are not letting quality controls slip."
"16761880","16767840"," As you take a look at shares of Boeing, remember, they currently build 38 737 MAXs per month. "
"16768140","16772980"," That's going to be gradually increasing, steadily increasing over the next year and a half until"
"16772980","16776640"," they hit 50 per month in the 2025-2026 timeframe."
"16777100","16782060"," Some of that increase, by the way, guys, is scheduled to be happening in the first half of this"
"16782060","16783820"," year into the second half of this year."
"16783820","16790300"," I'm curious, Phil, as to why you say that some of these grounded planes may be back in service as"
"16790300","16792080"," soon as the next couple of days. "
"16792580","16799180"," When it doesn't sound as though the investigators really know what caused this anomaly to happen."
"16800320","16802660"," I think that could tell you something, Tyler."
"16802900","16808940"," Well, they may not know exactly why or they're not saying publicly why they believe that this part"
"16808940","16811840"," of the fuselage was ripped off of the Alaska Airlines plane. "
"16811840","16821300"," The FAA is confident from working with Boeing in terms of making sure that whatever issue might be"
"16821300","16825420"," at cause here is not reflected in these other MAX nines."
"16825960","16828020"," And so they put this process together."
"16828420","16833440"," The FAA would not approve it if they were not confident that these planes could be safe to fly"
"16833440","16833660"," again. "
"16833660","16838780"," And, Phil, is it also true, according to Jeffries, that only 2% of the MAX backlog is of these"
"16838780","16841720"," kinds of planes, or the planes that have this kind of feature?"
"16844110","16846550"," No, it's not that they have this kind of feature, Kelly."
"16846850","16850450"," It's the MAX 9 is a relatively small part of the Boeing backlog."
"16851070","16857230"," So when you look at the MAX, the bulk of the MAXs that are built, and by the way, Boeing's"
"16857230","16861290"," backlog is primarily about 80, 85%, 7, 3, 7 MAXs. "
"16861290","16866010"," And then you've got wide bodies and some other planes in there, but the bulk of it is the MAX."
"16866650","16870890"," Of that, the Dash 8 is the most popular that's being built right now."
"16871330","16875330"," The Dash 9, which is what's in question here, is a rather small number. "
"16875830","16875830"," What?"
"16876030","16878150"," 218 have been delivered since they've been approved."
"16878890","16883350"," Then you look at the backlog, there's a lot of orders, especially Southwest Airlines, for the"
"16883350","16888570"," smallest variant, the Dash 7 that has yet to be certified and approved for manufacturing."
"16889170","16895410"," And then there's the Dash 10, which is the largest, the extended version of the 737 MAX. "
"16895770","16899570"," That has also not been approved yet by the FAA, but that's in the backlog."
"16900070","16903350"," That's airlines have said we want the 10, or we want the 7."
"16903650","16905310"," That's where a lot of the backlog is."
"16905490","16906570"," But not so much for the 9."
"16906750","16906930"," Okay. "
"16907190","16907590"," Thank you, Phil."
"16907750","16908370"," We appreciate it."
"16908590","16909110"," Our fillable. "
"16909490","16913850"," For more on the fallout for Boeing and what CEO Dave Calhoun has to do now, let's get to our"
"16913850","16914190"," panel."
"16914190","16917130"," Jason Gursky, a senior aerospace and defense analyst at City."
"16917370","16922010"," He's got a buy rating, a 315 price target on the shares and Michael Boyd is chairman of the Boyd"
"16922010","16924770"," group in aviation research and consulting firm. "
"16924770","16927110"," Michael Boyd, what's your reaction to the situation here?"
"16928170","16930550"," A piece of an airplane fell off in the sky."
"16930770","16932070"," And I think it's not as simple as just."
"16934250","16939810"," I worship Phil, but I'm wondering if this is a little simpler than it really is going to be going"
"16939810","16943450"," down because we did have an airplane that had a structural failure. "
"16943450","16945230"," Are there other airplanes out there?"
"16945650","16949270"," I think as Phil said, the FAA is going to be very, very circumspect about it."
"16949610","16954490"," The good news is, it's not going to affect the air transportation industry America."
"16954810","16956430"," It'll hurt her Alaska. "
"16956890","16958090"," It'll affect United."
"16958770","16962810"," But I think going forward, it may be going on a little bit beyond the next couple of days."
"16964170","16973870"," I asked Phil the question about allowing these planes back in the air before it would seem we know"
"16973870","16977930"," or the investigators know what exactly happened here. "
"16978210","16983950"," And his answer was basically, well, they wouldn't let them back in if they were concerned that they"
"16983950","16985210"," didn't meet the standard."
"16985570","16986910"," Am I understanding that correctly?"
"16987910","16989150"," Michael, that's for you."
"16989750","16990430"," Yeah, it is. "
"16990790","16990790"," Absolutely."
"16991450","16991930"," And Bill, right."
"16992530","16998690"," And I'm thinking something as serious as this, where you have a fuselage failure in flight. "
"16999570","17002270"," I think it's going to be a lot simpler than just looking at it."
"17002350","17006610"," I know Alaska initially let's 16 of them back in the sky until the FAA said no."
"17007070","17009830"," So I think I'm hoping we're right about that. "
"17010450","17012290"," But I think a lot simpler you said."
"17012490","17014010"," A lot simpler you said."
"17014170","17014890"," What do you mean by that?"
"17015610","17016890"," No, I mean, it's not as simple. "
"17017290","17022810"," What I'm saying here is what we have here is a simple situation where we do have a failure of"
"17022810","17025470"," the structure of an airplane that we know."
"17025970","17026950"," It's a serious problem."
"17026990","17031530"," And as a serious problem, I don't think the FAA is going to let anything hit the sky hit the"
"17031530","17035570"," runway until they're sure that it and the airplanes that have already been built. "
"17035810","17040130"," And those already at Spirit Arrow systems are completely compliant and safe."
"17040690","17042650"," Jason, the stock is moving off the lows."
"17042650","17047990"," And as I cited earlier, the Max 9 appears to be a small fraction of the backlog going forward. "
"17048350","17049910"," You also say it's the only configuration."
"17050010","17054750"," And Phil mentioned there's more demand for the 7 and the 10, but only the 9 has this plugged door"
"17054750","17055170"," configuration."
"17055430","17056050"," Is that right?"
"17056230","17058210"," And what do you think is going on with the shares today and from here?"
"17059250","17059990"," Yeah, that's right. "
"17060170","17062390"," The one that has this plugged door."
"17062570","17065350"," It's an aircraft that's largely designed for Ryan air, right?"
"17065350","17070510"," That flies more dense seating configuration and therefore needs the extra doors."
"17070510","17074790"," Other airlines aren't flying it as in such a dense way. "
"17075310","17076410"," Don't need those doors."
"17076870","17077710"," And so they plug them."
"17077810","17082810"," And I think it's really important to note here that these plug doors have been in the dash 9 going"
"17082810","17086370"," back to the ng program, which goes all the way back to the late 1990s. "
"17086370","17090370"," So this configuration has flown safely since the late 1990s."
"17090370","17094050"," The Max has been in service since 2015."
"17094130","17095850"," So there's a long history of operation. "
"17095950","17100370"," All right, so let's take a peek here kind of issue this, you know, just this back here."
"17100630","17101950"," Okay, Boeing safety."
"17102910","17103590"," Fucking nightmare. "
"17104010","17105770"," So just be aware right here."
"17105770","17106030"," Okay."
"17106670","17109370"," The original target was this R2 up here. "
"17110950","17112570"," You can see it right there."
"17112630","17113090"," Squeeze up."
"17113290","17116830"," Come back down to a five minute check back up here to the R2. "
"17117010","17119250"," Take a little while to get there, but we are getting there right now."
"17119250","17122470"," I don't know if we're going to continue to squeeze here."
"17122690","17124670"," I want to make a note to you right now, though. "
"17124810","17130750"," If you are long this morning, been long since I think I told everybody that was bold up on Friday."
"17131490","17136030"," If you are, I know some, I'm just talking about somebody that was saying that they took along for"
"17136030","17139570"," the week a weekly right trade here to the upside."
"17139570","17146650"," So price wise, I want you to be conscience of that 4750. "
"17148270","17155990"," Now this R3 is at 474.12. If you look at the bottom down here, bring this over here."
"17157390","17160910"," I want you to keep your eyes on this blue one right here."
"17161070","17161210"," Okay. "
"17161210","17164430"," So this is 4750 on SPX."
"17164990","17169630"," If we're able to trade up here into this gamma here, you want to take your money and run."
"17170290","17174050"," I don't care if it's today or Friday or whatever that is, but I want you to be aware of"
"17174050","17174690"," this up here. "
"17174810","17174970"," Okay."
"17175730","17177750"," That is a guaranteed cell signal."
"17190230","17191190"," Excuse me. "
"17191190","17196010"," On Tuesday and unlike Thursday and Friday of last week, you might do this, like, squeeze up into"
"17196010","17196330"," the clothes."
"17197070","17198690"," You'll be thinking everything is awesome sauce."
"17198830","17205290"," Then we roll back down into Tuesday and then test that that hourly trigger to the downside. "
"17206310","17207230"," Just be aware of it."
"17207250","17207910"," It's down here."
"17208330","17208670"," Okay. "
"17208870","17214130"," So if we either start to sell off this into the belt today, they grind sideways, wake up tomorrow"
"17214130","17215010"," and we're down here."
"17215010","17219430"," Squeeze this up into the clothes, but then we start selling down on Tuesday."
"17219810","17225150"," Just be aware of that Tuesday effect that turn around Tuesday to the downside that you don't get"
"17225150","17225730"," caught in it. "
"17226110","17227910"," You should be taking profit here as well."
"17228410","17232870"," If you are, if you were long up to this, I've gone to zero date, long to air, not weekly,"
"17232950","17234250"," but just zero date stuff."
"17234750","17239670"," And then re re-bid on a cheaper zero dates to R3. "
"17239790","17244970"," If you think we're going up to R3 into the clothes today for power between two and four PM."
"17245750","17246230"," Okay."
"17246610","17249150"," So whole new trade from here to here. "
"17249950","17254590"," If they trade us sideways and then grind it up possibly, bam, bam, bam, something like this, then"
"17254590","17259470"," we squeeze up into four PM, just be aware that we're likely going to sell into Tuesday."
"17260150","17264990"," If they, if we begin to pull back down here, right, something like this, anything like this"
"17264990","17268470"," sideways action, just be careful of Tuesday of a turnaround to the downside."
"17269550","17270730"," Can we get to R3?"
"17271150","17271270"," Fuck. "
"17271350","17276530"," Yeah, we can into the clothes, but either way, regardless, just be careful of this."
"17276630","17278730"," This is looming down here on Tuesday."
"17279670","17284730"," Don't forget turnaround Tuesdays and just to key in on that point as well. "
"17285390","17293950"," If you're looking at this cross here, this hourly trigger cross on the queues, the market likes to"
"17293950","17295510"," come back and retest these crosses."
"17295650","17296650"," It's pretty bullish here."
"17296970","17302490"," Just so you know, when you have an hourly cross on the daily trigger, it's very bullish, extremely"
"17302490","17302910"," bullish. "
"17302910","17309090"," But even though it's extremely bullish, you can wind up getting that like, yeah, I'm all FOMO and"
"17309090","17309310"," shit."
"17309450","17310290"," We're blasting off."
"17310430","17311590"," We get the cross below us. "
"17312010","17315070"," Then we come back down and test it and then launch again."
"17315910","17316110"," Okay."
"17316450","17318890"," So just be aware of this into the clothes today is my point. "
"17319710","17322310"," And let's take a quick look on a 30 minute chart in the queues."
"17323030","17324990"," We're going to switch over to a 30 minute chart here."
"17326190","17328170"," Let's just take a look at it right here, right?"
"17328370","17330450"," We're pretty close to that topping, right?"
"17330970","17333250"," So just take a peek at that right there. "
"17333730","17334450"," Here's the cues."
"17335170","17336230"," Just be careful, right?"
"17336350","17337010"," We're party time."
"17337290","17338390"," Yeah, everything's fucking awesome. "
"17339070","17342650"," We get into the clothes today and boom, they send you down on Tuesday."
"17343410","17346870"," We don't know if we're going to go up or if we're going to start blasting to the downside."
"17347330","17350690"," So just be aware of it as time progresses here. "
"17350910","17350990"," Okay."
"17350990","17356910"," And all your, if you're all pulled up here or whatever, just be aware of that."
"17358050","17359370"," Just be aware of that. "
"17360750","17363090"," There's, there might be a bull trap up in here."
"17363830","17368750"," 404, 405, somewhere up in here, 405 right in this zone, right where this thing is right here."
"17369610","17372890"," So just up in here, you're like all pulled up and you wake up tomorrow morning and they're selling"
"17372890","17373750"," into you by open. "
"17383780","17384180"," Nice."
"17384180","17384720"," Right, pork."
"17387570","17388290"," Oh, it's Chase. "
"17388350","17388930"," It's Chase."
"17388950","17389350"," Okay."
"17389510","17390770"," He's not short or anything, is he?"
"17393410","17394250"," You're not short. "
"17394410","17394830"," Are you Chase?"
"17396920","17398100"," I love you guys too."
"17398180","17399380"," I love you too, Jack Baker."
"17400140","17401620"," It's going to be back, screaming, baby. "
"17401660","17403900"," Getting back from the new for the new year with you."
"17408220","17410260"," Love all you guys out there."
"17412510","17414350"," Love all you guys out there. "
"17419420","17424570"," Yeah, just keep on cranking, baby."
"17426610","17427830"," Keep on keep on."
"17428610","17429890"," I'm flat right now. "
"17430030","17436490"," I had some calls this morning, but I'm not in anything right now."
"17436490","17439350"," So I can't be like actively managing a trade."
"17440110","17443030"," I got out down here, I think, right here. "
"17443130","17444410"," I think I got out somewhere down in here."
"17445190","17446390"," Oh, no, I sold right here."
"17446610","17447590"," That's where I sold right there. "
"17447770","17450470"," And then I was looking for a five minute check back over here."
"17450470","17452870"," And then I started getting text messages and all that crap."
"17453270","17455030"," So I've missed this whole entire run right here. "
"17459400","17460360"," That's mostly me."
"17460480","17464660"," I got, I got, I got, you guys have a, I wish I could show you some of this stuff"
"17464660","17465620"," right now, but."
"17466440","17474040"," So the developers seem to have made some huge breakthroughs, but if we thought we were launching at"
"17474040","17476720"," the end of or towards Christmas time. "
"17477360","17480740"," And we got pushed off to January 31st."
"17481260","17486280"," And then we have a bunch of technical stuff in the background that still hasn't gone through like."
"17488200","17489860"," Company structure stuff like that. "
"17489960","17492360"," We needed to create like four different companies, that kind of stuff."
"17492580","17493520"," According to Eric."
"17493700","17498080"," So I just been like, it's just been like push off, push off, push off, but we're at the home"
"17498080","17498940"," stretch right now. "
"17499700","17503060"," So I'm being like, I'm being being yanked in a bunch of different ways."
"17510920","17512160"," I used to do that board."
"17512500","17517940"," So I used to do is, I used to, what I used to do is do like a captain's long"
"17517940","17519800"," captain's short or captain's flat. "
"17519800","17522900"," And then I would fucking forget to change it."
"17524100","17525020"," Or do it."
"17525340","17529980"," So I used to do that and knew what happened, Bork was that I, what I used to happen was"
"17529980","17532160"," I would do it and I would forget to get pulled away. "
"17532660","17536220"," And people would come into the stream and be like, is he still short right now?"
"17536280","17539420"," It says he's short up there or he says he's flat right now."
"17539760","17541680"," So I wasn't keeping up with it enough."
"17542020","17544260"," And so people would be under the wrong impression. "
"17544640","17546180"," We tried that a couple of years ago."
"17546620","17549220"," And it was a matter of the updating."
"17549220","17551080"," I wasn't like consistent enough. "
"17552000","17556880"," And then there was another problem to Bork, which was people were trading to me."
"17558240","17561600"," And so what would happen would be people would trade to me."
"17562020","17566420"," And then what we would do is we'd go back and find out what they were long and shorted and"
"17566420","17568020"," they would only take some of my trades. "
"17569100","17573280"," So you'd have like a loser, someone would be a fucking loser, like they'd lose, right?"
"17573840","17578740"," They'd like check their trades and you'd find out that they were only taking some of my trades."
"17579280","17582140"," And then being like, yeah, this is like, I'm a loser here."
"17582340","17583920"," Will you take this trade to take that trade?"
"17584100","17584260"," No. "
"17584800","17590380"," So it's very like sketchy on our end to be like, it's, this is a like liability issue."
"17590380","17593720"," And then there's, are they actually trading with you or not?"
"17595040","17596780"," Or find out the find out that people are not."
"17597760","17601300"," So an example would be this, like, how do I explain it?"
"17601720","17602700"," Another way to explain it. "
"17603120","17608860"," It's like, let's say, you'd have like somebody would be like, oh, yeah, go long right here, right?"
"17609080","17610760"," So they would not be long with you there."
"17610880","17611760"," They'd go long there."
"17611840","17612960"," They're not long with you there. "
"17613200","17615800"," And then right here, they get long and it rolls on them."
"17616680","17619360"," And they're like tripling, doubling, tripling down."
"17619520","17621340"," Then you ask them what they're trading and you're like, wait a minute. "
"17621440","17623100"," This guy just like spent a thousand bucks."
"17624160","17624780"," He made a grand."
"17625100","17633920"," So now he's in here for two grand and you're like, right?"
"17634360","17636180"," And they wouldn't. "
"17636740","17637760"," They wouldn't buy cheaper."
"17637980","17639560"," They like double triple quadruple down."
"17639720","17644680"," So we were being used as like a, well, the stream was being used as like a quick lotto, like"
"17644680","17645940"," a fucking lottery for people. "
"17645940","17646840"," So I don't do it anymore."
"17647140","17648500"," I don't don't do any of it anymore."
"17648860","17649980"," And let them make their own trades. "
"17655430","17657250"," So this is directed towards Bork, if you're asking."
"17657510","17662610"," So now we're trying to do like, you'd make your own trades, take your own trades, do all your own"
"17662610","17662970"," stuff."
"17662970","17666770"," None of that like following me too closely, all that kind of stuff. "
"17671860","17672980"," Yeah, that's true too."
"17673200","17676440"," Like even right here, like if you're long all day long right here, you should be taken over."
"17676720","17677340"," Not you should be. "
"17677420","17677560"," I'm not."
"17677620","17678660"," This is not financial advice."
"17678940","17679460"," For me at least. "
"17680100","17682840"," I take the money at every, like every directional move."
"17682840","17684480"," I take the money and I jump back in again."
"17685000","17689140"," I've been burned too long being like long on the open and don't close it until fucking. "
"17689320","17693940"," Matter of fact, if you had done that on Thursday and Friday, you'd be an end of the day loser,"
"17694180","17694380"," right?"
"17695000","17697160"," You'd be in the day loser on Thursday and Friday."
"17697460","17701580"," So now we know where the cell points were on Thursday and Friday."
"17701820","17703640"," The cell point on Thursday was the hourly trigger. "
"17704200","17707520"," And then the cell point on Friday was the previous high from Thursday."
"17707560","17709900"," So it's pretty fairly easy to see where the cells were."
"17710460","17716060"," But like when you're streaming and there's like 5,000 people watching these people, people kind of"
"17716060","17719960"," the stream doing be like, I'm fucking long the end or some crazy shit like that. "
"17720140","17721860"," So we don't do it anymore."
"17724460","17725440"," Oh, it's ready, ready."
"17725780","17726360"," Like we got a tool. "
"17726840","17728320"," It's like, it's fucking ready."
"17728560","17732840"," Like I'm so with this like some small detail shit, but we actually have the tool."
"17734300","17738720"," We actually have, I think I shouldn't say this shit, but I think we have the tool. "
"17739860","17741920"," We have like, and the packages are kind of cool."
"17742080","17747420"," There's like a, there's some kind of like a $20 package where you get access to the tool on the"
"17747420","17750840"," website for like three, four, five tickers."
"17751320","17756620"," And it's like 35 bucks for like, I think it's like 12 tickers. "
"17757200","17762120"," And then there's like another package where you can do like 15 tickers or 20 tickers or something"
"17762120","17770400"," for like, I think it's $45 and then there's like a discord thing and then there's the takeaway tool"
"17770400","17771900"," where you can walk away with it."
"17772640","17776120"," Then use it on your own on anything in the stock market."
"17776120","17776660"," It's pretty cool. "
"17776660","17778640"," So we're almost there with the tools."
"17779260","17781780"," We get a bunch of other cool tools to their almost the completion."
"17782000","17788380"," We got a stock scanner and the levels for the expanded market with charts and everything. "
"17788680","17792880"," So every morning you can show up and get out, get your levels and stuff."
"17793060","17793380"," It's really cool."
"17796360","17797620"," Yeah, just hang out with the free. "
"17798180","17802880"," What will happen is when we were supposed to launch the 25th of December, right?"
"17803180","17803640"," Didn't happen."
"17804410","17810300"," We did it did so that the deployments of deliverables was not where it was not acceptable to what I"
"17810300","17810460"," want."
"17810680","17820180"," You guys got to understand something like it's hard for developers to deploy what the vision is"
"17820180","17820540"," right. "
"17821240","17824540"," And then it's got me there to going."
"17824940","17825800"," It's not there."
"17826000","17833440"," It's not right. "
"17833440","17836960"," This is what we're going to launch and we're not going to fucking launch it unless it's right."
"17838100","17847260"," So if it's never right, it's never fucking right, but I refuse to make the make the next jump from"
"17847260","17849860"," like we completed what we wanted to do."
"17849880","17850880"," We set out to do right. "
"17851020","17856660"," We set out to create community of retail traders for traders by traders and in their own interest,"
"17856660","17861820"," not in the interest of CNBC or fucking."
"17861820","17868460"," You know, I'm not going to name names, but this is basically trying to help a fucking trader and"
"17868460","17871520"," investor from square one into become profitable."
"17871520","17873000"," We succeeded in that. "
"17873340","17875060"," We did our job to completion."
"17876080","17878080"," I feel good about everything that we've done."
"17878440","17886060"," Now, if we're going to make this to be something that is self-sustaining in the future and to be"
"17886060","17887720"," able to take the next leap or jump. "
"17888320","17891540"," Then I have high expectations of what we do what that is."
"17891720","17895380"," And until we get to that point, we don't launch."
"17895820","17896620"," Not that guy. "
"17896960","17898040"," I refuse to do it."
"17898220","17907900"," So tentatively, we're to launch on the 31st and everything looks great on the back end."
"17908000","17909140"," It looks fucking phenomenal. "
"17909400","17911460"," I can't tell you how fucking awesome this looks."
"17911740","17913440"," And we have cool plans for the future too."
"17913540","17914820"," We got a whole bunch of cool stuff coming out. "
"17914820","17917840"," So, let me just get technical stuff."
"17918040","17925940"," We got like stuffed with the with the with the law and stuff and banking and company formations and"
"17925940","17927480"," stuff like that that has to be worked out."
"17927920","17929480"," And some of that stuff still isn't done. "
"17934540","17936820"," You wish the what the trigger and the K will be in the middle."
"17936940","17939100"," I got you guys are going to have access to the trigger."
"17939100","17941420"," Twenty five bucks or something like that. "
"17943240","17944000"," Something like that."
"17944220","17944840"," It's a kick ass."
"17945160","17945160"," So. "
"17951250","17953210"," I like like I'm trading zero dates."
"17953210","17954410"," It's directional only."
"17954530","17954670"," Right. "
"17955250","17957810"," If something costs me 50 cents, then it goes to a buck."
"17958530","17963230"," I take the fucking dollar off, put it in my pocket and go back in and try to buy like"
"17963230","17965210"," 35 cents or 50 cents or even less."
"17965470","17967130"," Sometimes I'll leave some shit on to keep running. "
"17967650","17967990"," I'll leave runner."
"17968250","17969630"," People do with runners and stuff."
"17969630","17975510"," But for me with specifically the zero dates and then if you're trading like I was just on the phone"
"17975510","17976490"," with somebody just now. "
"17976710","17982270"," It was like I bought weeklies on the opening bell this morning and I was like, well, you know,"
"17982270","17985550"," you're going to be monetizing either Wednesday, Thursday or the key said that."
"17985930","17990430"," And then I said, and the other thing is price you monetize price to not just time."
"17990430","17995430"," So if you hit we hit four seventy five, you take those fucking weekly calls off, call it a day"
"17995430","17996010"," and get out of there. "
"17996430","17998670"," Regardless if we keep going up, doesn't fucking matter."
"17998970","18001710"," You you every trade is negotiated, right?"
"18002370","18007730"," It doesn't matter if it's a day trade, a week trade, a month trade, a three month trade."
"18008050","18013990"," In my experience when I've got I've come to where I wanted to go either renegotiate the trade. "
"18013990","18019270"," If I still believe in it right with a cheaper price, take some money off the table or I leave"
"18019270","18023990"," some runners on hopefully that'll hopefully like go ten times 30 times something like that."
"18024510","18029530"," But in my experience, I've never had a problem taking profit and renegotiating."
"18031290","18032810"," And that's the cool thing, right?"
"18033290","18034630"," You bought some shit and 30 delta. "
"18034970","18035950"," Now they're fucking in the money."
"18036210","18037710"," Then you go back and buy some more 30 delta."
"18037950","18038850"," It's a no brainer. "
"18044950","18046150"," Yes, bear town."
"18046270","18050470"," There's going to be whatever you're looking at for whatever you guys are looking at."
"18050510","18053010"," I know there's some tears on the website right now. "
"18053450","18058130"," Those are all placeholders don't be looking at those tears and thinking that's what the tears are."
"18058250","18061870"," So those are not the tears if you think that they are."
"18063310","18064510"," Those are all placeholders. "
"18064730","18065110"," That's it."
"18065650","18067110"," We're trying to it's weird."
"18067390","18069570"," Like we're trying to these tear things. "
"18070030","18072030"," There's like a tool we have to use."
"18072210","18076310"," And so we're like building all this stuff out and running tests and all that kind of stuff."
"18082480","18084100"," Oh, they're going higher now, baby. "
"18085120","18087660"," Get up there and trade that for 7412."
"18087660","18092420"," Keep your eyes down below the S&P 500 4750 on SPX."
"18092940","18095520"," I'm going to blow this one up down here so you can see it. "
"18096540","18098360"," I'm going to put a little box right here."
"18098660","18099580"," We're right there."
"18102460","18102940"," Congratulations. "
"18103400","18105940"," If you're a bull taking this next trade up here."
"18107800","18111940"," There's the little yellow box right there so you can see it right down there down below."
"18115150","18116590"," Put a little arrow to it. "
"18123600","18124900"," Just right there."
"18126180","18128040"," Let's see if I can do a permanent arrow there."
"18143660","18144540"," Right there. "
"18144540","18144840"," Okay."
"18147600","18149520"," Big old fucking yellow hour right there."
"18154610","18156110"," Yeah, those aren't final tears. "
"18156410","18157410"," Those are all placeholders."
"18159230","18161350"," The tear system right now."
"18161610","18163650"," Let me look and see if I have it in front. "
"18163790","18164490"," I don't know if I have it."
"18164550","18167570"," I don't think I have it in front of me, but I don't hold me to this, but there's something"
"18167570","18168130"," like a."
"18169270","18170790"," There's like the absolute free tear."
"18170830","18172730"," Then they think the first here is 20 bucks. "
"18173570","18179390"," Then 35 then 45 and then I think there's a 65 and a 150."
"18180450","18187010"," And then in those tears, there's in a yearly price that has a lot of it knocked off."
"18187270","18188970"," So if you sign up for the year, it's even cheaper. "
"18192590","18197170"," Yeah, yeah, if you just be cool right now, I know you guys are chomping at the bit, but it's"
"18197170","18197890"," something like that."
"18198430","18199830"," You don't have to register right now."
"18199950","18200190"," Don't worry. "
"18200350","18204350"," You guys are going to do like a we're going to do like this kind of a campaign thing where."

"18217310","18218650"," this 10 people get that. "
"18219190","18221550"," And then all that shit gets launched to you guys."
"18221610","18225490"," Like I launched that shit to you guys in the stream people in the discord."
"18226610","18231710"," And then we go public with it after you guys have the ability to sign up for that stuff so. "
"18232950","18234190"," I got you guys covered."
"18239740","18242420"," Do do do do do do do do do."
"18246820","18248620"," You won't crank in. "
"18249060","18251220"," Keep on pushing don't stop now."
"18255690","18257690"," Who's selling the clothes on this anyone."
"18258810","18261010"," I think I'm going to sell the fucking clothes on this. "
"18261930","18264150"," whatever this close is, I want to sell it."
"18265070","18266830"," Am I the only one that's going to sell this stuff?"
"18268570","18269510"," Is it just me?"
"18275100","18276560"," And then what else we got going on?"
"18276960","18279820"," I got, we got other stuff in development."
"18280140","18281720"," We've got some gamma stuff in development. "
"18282040","18287080"," We got some paper trading and option profit calculators, some VOX stuff, some really cool shit"
"18287080","18287780"," working in the background."
"18306700","18309680"," Tesla probably the same as earlier, I don't think there's any difference in Tesla."
"18311620","18313260"," What do we have on Tesla here?"
"18316500","18323680"," Right there, there's a Tesla looking for Tesla to come up here and then sell. "
"18326260","18333060"," I'd really like to see Tesla trade that 244 and the bell here squeezing the close to be nice for"
"18333060","18333320"," Tesla."
"18333320","18349300"," I make natural"

"18370020","18371680"," a barrel."
"18371680","18376060"," Shit, that's down $3 or 4.12% on the session."
"18383950","18385610"," So that's the excel I can't remember. "
"18389580","18392180"," Protect your trade from macro headline risk."
"18392380","18393620"," That's where your cell is above."
"18394060","18396660"," Yeah, I think you said he's a cell on the close. "
"18397140","18399080"," Yeah, I think we have to turn around in the close to bank."
"18401380","18403560"," Come back down, retest all this crap down."

"18443580","18445110"," That's what I've got it at."
"18454050","18455530"," Keep a whole crank in."
"18456430","18457890"," Yeah, Chase, I saw. "
"18458270","18459130"," Chase, I saw."
"18459290","18460570"," I got the emails over the weekend."
"18461290","18462790"," I was like, these fucking guys are wrong. "
"18463270","18465530"," It's like these fucking guys are talking about fucking."
"18466930","18469130"," We're blasting above right now."
"18469370","18470030"," Where's the next level?"
"18470570","18476910"," Oh, next target to the upside on SPX. "
"18478570","18488600"," $4.774, $4.775, $4.775. $4 "
"18488600","18490120",".775 up here."
"18490800","18492260"," I'll leave you another error up there."
"18496250","18497970"," Did you kind of do a four on that one?"
"18499790","18500950"," Right there. "
"18501370","18518580"," $4.775. Oh, yeah, we'll"
"18518580","18519220"," see it."
"18519660","18521920"," You'll see that retest on Qs."
"18522500","18526980"," We'll always come back on these squeezes and retest that cross, that hourly cross. "
"18527540","18528180"," That's the fucking movie."
"18536640","18538260"," Oh, even Bob has it wrong too."
"18538560","18541720"," Oh, he's forget if it's RTX the top and STX the bottom or not. "
"18548900","18550620"," UNG calls are fucking in the money."
"18551000","18551980"," That feels like a trap."
"18556850","18557830"," That's fucking hilarious. "
"18560930","18562590"," Let's see him bring this over right here."
"18568640","18571020"," Bring that bad boy back out right there."
"18573180","18574800"," Back with you here for a minute here. "
"18579790","18581190"," Arly trigger on what?"
"18581470","18581710"," Camille?"
"18583770","18585670"," It's on 469, brother."
"18586250","18586590"," 469."
"18591810","18592250"," 469. "
"18592810","18601530"," Here, let's look at, yeah, they could run this up into tonight too."
"18602670","18604350"," We'll run this up right into tonight."
"18610470","18612670"," Yeah, so I'm getting text messages right now. "
"18612910","18613830"," People are going to take the money."
"18614530","18617110"," I got friends here saying one more dollar and I'm out."
"18622720","18627700"," So they're getting text messages right now from people saying that they're out one more dollar. "
"18627880","18629480"," So just heads up."
"18629700","18632640"," I got full friends there on weeklies right now."
"18632680","18634080"," They're just looking to take the money up there. "
"18634260","18648650"," I wasn't a"
"18648650","18649090"," meeting shack."
"18649310","18650250"," I wasn't even long, dude."
"18650410","18650690"," I was out. "
"18651630","18652270"," I was flat, dude."
"18652590","18655670"," I didn't want to, I didn't want to like watch it, manage it and all that shit."
"18656350","18657350"," That's fucking flat, bro. "
"18657810","18658670"," I was, I'm with you."
"18658950","18659850"," I was in meetings too, man."
"18660430","18661390"," I fucking missed it. "
"18668960","18672480"," Yeah, I would expect, I would expect that by the close people are going to exit."
"18673340","18675440"," I'm assuming that, anyone that was long."
"18699630","18700070"," Ooh. "
"18700070","18704350"," How close we're getting the earnings accounting season, pre-report pumpathon for DX."
"18735890","18802750"," Oh, man."
"18802750","18802850"," Yeah. "
"18947790","18949770"," I'm still going to do this show."
"18949990","18953710"," Okay, so I want to, this is a good question."
"18954010","18957110"," So JTRVA says Capri is still going to do this job to release the new tools. "
"18957370","18959750"," So on that topic,"
"18959750","18967690"," we're trying to do this."
"18967690","18969270"," There are a lot of administrators, moderators."
"18969390","18973770"," There's a lot of people involved in this that have done this for free, including myself, right?"
"18974910","18978770"," Now there's been a lot of support from community as well to keep it running. "
"18979170","18984490"," So there's been money coming in to support all the work in the background, all the costs to us."
"18984810","18990510"," All this studio, all the stuff was paid for, all the upkeep, all the upgrades, you name it."
"18991430","18995250"," You guys pay for that by donating and have since the beginning. "
"18995770","19005290"," So the idea here is that by taking this to the next level, there'll always be a show we can"
"19005290","19007670"," then bring on someone to do nighttime videos."
"19008430","19011390"," We can bring on somebody to do Sunday stock show."
"19011830","19015950"," We can bring on people that are professionals and what they do, right?"
"19016090","19018710"," Or keep people interested of what they do. "
"19019130","19020610"," We need to keep people around here."
"19020810","19026370"," The problem with what we're doing is after a few years, people get tired."
"19026770","19028010"," They've done a lot of hard work. "
"19028370","19031670"," They've no honorariums for them."
"19032070","19036570"," So the idea here would be an expansion of what we do, not a retraction or even less."
"19037790","19043470"," And some kind of a way to keep everything that has always been free, free, or near free for the"
"19043470","19043790"," future. "
"19044070","19046410"," So or at least what the cost of what it is to do."
"19047330","19053730"," So yes, the streams will stay and you'll have expansion as well, what you get."
"19054070","19058150"," So there'll be private streams, there'll be private market. "
"19058390","19061130"," We're getting market updates, all kinds of cool shit."
"19061330","19063730"," So you're going to get like a market update, whatever it's needed."
"19064010","19069590"," If it's every day written, written market updates, all the stuff that you really want, like the"
"19069590","19078070"," stuff that the people are willing to pay for to help get us to that next level, where it's more"
"19078070","19078350"," consistent. "
"19079650","19081450"," We have like streaming every day."
"19081690","19083290"," Yeah, it has to be paid for."
"19083450","19083770"," It's hard. "
"19084350","19089530"," It's hard for my end to like, yeah, hold on a second."
"19089530","19092890"," Here's an example for you."
"19092970","19094830"," So last year, right?"
"19095190","19104050"," In 2023, I streamed 200 2025 streams"
"19104050","19106970"," last year. "
"19107370","19107850"," That's insane."
"19108590","19114950"," I don't know if you know that, but that's an insane number of streams for free."
"19115130","19115490"," It's like insane. "
"19116450","19117110"," No one does that."
"19117710","19118830"," Nobody, they've monetized."
"19118970","19119470"," They take sponsors. "
"19120890","19121750"," They do merchandising."
"19122290","19125050"," They do all kinds of shit to at least pay for that time."
"19125670","19131990"," So at just last year, we had 2025 streams, an average of 6.5 hours per stream, which is fucking"
"19131990","19132870"," insanity too. "
"19133530","19134430"," No one does that."
"19134710","19142650"," Like I don't know anyone, not a single, not a single person on YouTube or Twitch that does that"
"19142650","19145070"," without some kind of monetization."
"19145810","19149570"," And so we're just at a point where you guys want it every day, right?"
"19149750","19153690"," You guys want it all 251 or 52 days of the year. "
"19153910","19155070"," You guys want more consistency."
"19155830","19159910"," You guys want me here at 930 every day or someone here at 930 every day."
"19160450","19166610"," So for us to like make that jump towards like a completely fucking free to more professionalized or"
"19166610","19171870"," more consistent or more meeting your needs and stuff like that, and getting the tools so you can"
"19171870","19175190"," use them together and the discords, that kind of stuff, we need to make that jump. "
"19175290","19177790"," So if you think that anything's going away, it's not."
"19177930","19178790"," If anything will be expanded."
"19179430","19184590"," And the really cool part of this too is people have been asking for this for years and we haven't"
"19184590","19186890"," done it in any way, shape or form. "
"19187150","19190850"," So this will only enhance your experience as it is now."
"19191890","19195970"," Your experience actually becomes enhanced with this."
"19196190","19200610"," So if you're like a person that's poor or doesn't want to pay or just believe in it, whatever,"
"19201070","19206450"," you're actually going to get a better experience from this than its past form. "
"19207110","19208170"," And we don't want it to go away."
"19208290","19214430"," That's the other thing too is we don't want it to be like something where it just dissolves unless"
"19214430","19215370"," this doesn't work."
"19215530","19218610"," Like if this doesn't go and people are like, oh fuck this, I ain't doing this or I'm not finding"
"19218610","19222150"," value in what these guys are doing or what these guys bring to the table. "
"19222290","19223650"," You guys are with me every day, right?"
"19224750","19226390"," Some of you guys have been here since day one."
"19226750","19232650"," Some of you guys have been watching me day trade straight up for fucking three fucking years."
"19233470","19237730"," Like that time that you've committed to me but with you guys here every day, it's made me a better"
"19237730","19238250"," fucking trader. "
"19238930","19241150"," Like I rarely get caught anymore rarely."
"19241530","19243010"," Like I'm talking fucking rare."
"19243310","19244230"," Do I get caught anymore?"
"19244990","19248450"," That's by being in this market with you guys six, seven hours every fucking day. "
"19248490","19250030"," You guys have made that happen as a community."
"19250630","19252790"," You guys were like, we'll be here if you show up, right?"
"19253190","19254350"," And I showed up for you."
"19254350","19257130"," It's like you put me through a goddamn college of day trading. "
"19257370","19258130"," It's been insane."
"19258930","19263930"," So we just wanted to make that next step, make sure that there's continuation on it."
"19265250","19266030"," It's fucking ridiculous. "
"19266950","19268390"," You guys have changed me as a person."
"19268590","19268950"," I got to be honest."
"19269290","19270970"," You guys are fucking changed me as a person. "
"19271490","19275470"," And you know, like I don't know what I was saying that but it's really cool."
"19279030","19283410"," Yeah, that would be cool as fuck."
"19283590","19285410"," So nothing changes. "
"19285790","19287310"," And generally speaking, nothing changes."
"19287630","19288710"," There's even like a lower tier."
"19288890","19291210"," There's like a there's like a tear where you don't actually sign up for anything. "
"19291210","19293190"," And let's say you're like, I don't want any of this stuff."
"19293270","19294250"," I just want to be in the stream."
"19294270","19298110"," You can just do the five bucks in the stream and that and then you get to chat and stuff"
"19298110","19298530"," like that. "
"19298950","19304830"," Most of that stuff like that five, 10, $20 stuff is geared towards two specific things, protecting"
"19304830","19306550"," our members, which we have to do."
"19306650","19311710"," We have to like we officially protect our members, which we can't do as a free service."
"19312490","19315610"," We have to be able to also offer service more service. "
"19316010","19319970"," Like some of the cool stuff the discord is going to have like tickets and stuff for like media"
"19319970","19320330"," support."
"19320710","19322770"," You'll see me in the discord more frequently."
"19323550","19326290"," You'll see people there to help you when you really need help. "
"19326490","19332050"," Like I need help with educational stuff that we're doing that's included and stuff like that."
"19332130","19336750"," We got a whole bunch of educational content too that can now be produced for free for everybody,"
"19336750","19337630"," which is kind of cool."
"19337970","19338650"," Like step one. "
"19338870","19339310"," What's a share?"
"19339730","19340250"," What's a stock?"
"19340430","19341530"," What's a publicly traded company?"
"19342510","19346650"," That kind of stuff like right from grassroots fucking zero."
"19347450","19349370"," Like I'm brand fucking new."
"19349470","19350590"," I don't know what the fuck I'm doing. "
"19351150","19352310"," So it should be pretty cool."
"19353610","19355990"," That stuff will always be free too, which is kind of neat."
"19356230","19362140"," So has there been talk about tools for Thinkorswim?"
"19362280","19362480"," No. "
"19362700","19370600"," And furthermore, the truth is on my end, we don't even want to be using Thinkorswim or TradingView."
"19371080","19378200"," We're trying to do we're trying to at some point have like our own trading view."
"19378580","19381960"," Like that's why I made that post about Quinn's trading and stuff like that. "
"19382080","19385000"," We want our own fucking trading view to be honest with you."
"19385800","19388700"," That's the truth and the way back end down the road."
"19394330","19395270"," I see you primal. "
"19397370","19397770"," Yeah."
"19398070","19399530"," I want to be able to do that for you guys."
"19399710","19399910"," I got it. "
"19399990","19401470"," You guys got to understand from you."
"19401790","19403110"," I think you guys do understand."
"19403470","19404550"," So from my end too, right?"
"19405150","19406350"," Like my wife and my kids. "
"19406410","19408090"," They fucking hate me right now."
"19408110","19409470"," Like they fucking hate me."
"19409630","19410750"," I'll be truthful with you guys. "
"19411430","19413230"," They do not like me right now."
"19413230","19416450"," Like you got to understand that I was kind of like semi-retired."
"19417950","19420870"," And then I'm like, I want to go do this fucking thing. "
"19421070","19422270"," I want to go be a Robin Hooder."
"19422610","19425450"," And it was awesome."
"19425790","19426730"," I fucking loved it. "
"19426930","19431890"," But now it's been like two and a half, three years, and they're like, you know, what are you doing?"
"19432370","19434790"," You know, it's like we want your time too."
"19434790","19440850"," And I'm like, I have to like, there's like this whole aspect of this where, you know, it has to"
"19440850","19445750"," become something more or we or we just bring it back down to like 10 or 20 people or 100"
"19445750","19449590"," people and just fuck around and hang out and drink beer and trade once a week or once a month"
"19449590","19449870"," together."
"19455570","19455970"," Yeah. "
"19458250","19459870"," We're trying in the background."
"19460310","19462650"," We're like, we're trying to bring a prop training firm in."
"19463270","19467790"," We've got people here in the chat right now that are have that offer or that at least that"
"19467790","19474110"," discussion on the table to do like a boot camp, right?"
"19474310","19482130"," We teach you how to day trade and you get to use somebody else's money and it's tied into what"
"19482130","19482490"," we're doing. "
"19482790","19484790"," So it's like some really cool shit coming down the pike."
"19485910","19487150"," Really super cool shit."
"19488270","19492010"," So we'll be there holding your fucking hands teaching you how to be a fucking real true trader"
"19492010","19493530"," using other people's money. "
"19493530","19494170"," It's really cool."
"19497400","19497760"," Yeah."
"19500440","19503580"," Like, you know, it's just like this like the Christmas, right?"
"19503780","19507020"," Like Christmas, I'm like, well, I'm gonna tell my wife and kids. "
"19507100","19508980"," I'm like, I'm gonna go do this with my people, right?"
"19509920","19510700"," And then we get sick."
"19511700","19513280"," So I'm like, finally fucking ill."
"19514060","19516340"," I got nobody that can stand in for me, right?"
"19516600","19517800"," I got like, who am I gonna go to?"
"19518440","19519600"," Like, you stand in for me?"
"19520320","19521340"," Do the live stream for me?"
"19521780","19524120"," Like, nobody like, I gotta, I'll be honest with you. "
"19524120","19526440"," If I find somebody to stand in for me, I'm probably fucking paying."
"19526640","19526980"," You know what I mean?"
"19527440","19528100"," Like, pay them."
"19528380","19530600"," Like, do you want somebody that knows what they're doing?"
"19531320","19532600"," I'm being serious with you, right?"
"19533020","19534660"," I'm gonna be 100% with you right now. "
"19535120","19538540"," There ain't nobody that knows the fuck they're doing that wants to be doing that shit for free."
"19539580","19540100"," That's true."
"19541080","19543120"," Like, how do I get somebody to stand in for me?"
"19543540","19545320"," And then I get the other end of it, right?"
"19545900","19550020"," I got my wife and kids at the same time going, you know, we miss Christmas and I want to"
"19550020","19553620"," go back and see my mom and my family for new years, right?"
"19553620","19555780"," So, what do I do there?"
"19555940","19560060"," I got to, I got to, I got to like weigh what I can and can't do, right?"
"19560600","19567920"," And so, it's, it's, it makes life so much fucking easier to be like, hey, this person is really,"
"19568280","19569220"," has great market awareness. "
"19569920","19572720"," This person probably sit in for me, you know, that kind of stuff."
"19573000","19576300"," So, it's hard to fucking do it, but it's all fucking free."
"19576400","19578180"," It's just, it's just sloppy. "
"19578860","19585080"," There, it grows to that point where it's very rough around the edges and you are seamless and it's"
"19585080","19588060"," hard to do that in our current state, right?"
"19588180","19592740"," We've grown to a point where, we've grown to a point where we either need to shut it all down"
"19592740","19597020"," or we need to give it a run to see if it will take care of itself."
"19597840","19599600"," I think that's where we're at as a group."
"19602800","19603600"," You did see it. "
"19603660","19604860"," You saw a clone of Trading View?"
"19605400","19605720"," That's badass."
"19606540","19607860"," The data is so expensive."
"19608220","19610860"," Like, we're looking at it right now. "
"19611020","19618200"," It is, it's, it's, we need to proof of cons, we need proof that what we're doing is we can"
"19618200","19618800"," go there with."
"19619100","19624800"," You know, that's another part of this too, really, is, you know, you can ask anybody out there that"
"19624800","19627260"," the tool is not really what we are."
"19627580","19631300"," I need you guys to understand that we put a lot of focus on the tool around here and the"
"19631300","19634780"," truth is, right, the real value is us as a community. "
"19635660","19637180"," That's what the real fucking value is."
"19638020","19645540"," The time and market, the people, like you can't fucking pay it."
"19645580","19646440"," You can't develop that. "
"19646580","19647820"," You can't, can't do it."
"19647920","19651880"," John L, what he does, can't, there's, there is no tool for that."
"19653060","19655200"," There's no, there's no tool to replace Bob Kendall. "
"19655780","19657080"," There's no tool to replace Mr. Yen."
"19657320","19661160"," There's no tool to replace any of those, like, Jedi Marcus."
"19661700","19662720"," There's no fucking tool for that guy. "
"19663100","19667660"," When I tell you guys to follow Jedi Marcus, that's going to be gone someday, gone."
"19668620","19671060"," There are no, there are no pit traders anymore."
"19671660","19674540"," You know, James Jimmy Jude, you know, those kind of guys. "
"19675520","19678040"," Gem, those guys will be gone one day."
"19678420","19679760"," You can't buy that shit."
"19680500","19682040"," There's no replacing that shit. "
"19682820","19684160"," And I think that's what we have."
"19684360","19685340"," I don't think it's the tool."
"19685580","19691080"," I think what we have is more important than any fucking tool. "
"19691340","19691980"," It's like gamma."
"19692420","19693340"," Like you look at gamma, right?"
"19693860","19696320"," I guess I got a bunch of gamma tools, right?"
"19696880","19698860"," I got my daughter building gamma tools for him."
"19698880","19701020"," We got a developer working on gamma tools for us. "
"19701340","19704220"," Does it really matter who's got the fucking gamma tools?"
"19705040","19707060"," Or does the gamma tool matter?"
"19707540","19709320"," No, it's who's wielding them, right?"
"19710040","19711880"," Like do you, it's like, do I trust chair one?"
"19712140","19712340"," Fuck."
"19712460","19712540"," Yeah."
"19712740","19713520"," Do I trust, fuck. "
"19713700","19713760"," Yeah."
"19714620","19715660"," Do I trust this guy?"
"19715880","19716000"," Fuck."
"19716000","19716260"," Yeah. "
"19716620","19717540"," They got the fucking tools."
"19717600","19719100"," They all get the same goddamn tools."
"19719580","19723260"," You know, they can claim that it's proprietary and that it's their specific thing. "
"19723700","19724700"," But the truth is, right?"
"19725220","19729160"," It really is a matter of who are you with, who you're running with."
"19729480","19731220"," And that matters."
"19731520","19732120"," That matters. "
"19734950","19735430"," Yeah."
"19735610","19737130"," I agree to just some guy."
"19737310","19739050"," This is a golden age of retailers. "
"19739690","19743210"," I'm fascinated to see where it goes to the rise of retail, right?"
"19743610","19745030"," We're not done with the rise of retail."
"19745210","19745930"," I don't think that we are."
"19748660","19749140"," Yeah. "
"19755080","19756860"," I love you, it's fucking baller, dude."
"19757480","19759620"," We catch so much shit from people out there."
"19759780","19762400"," But the truth is, they care about what we think. "
"19762700","19769060"," Like we were talking, we're trading S&P 500 with, we think, like, we think at least 5,000 people"
"19769060","19774720"," every day, 6,000, possibly more because it gets rebroadcast and discords gets rebroadcast and hedge"
"19774720","19775040"," funds."
"19775960","19776720"," The people are watching."
"19776720","19779080"," We're not trading fucking pump and dump stocks. "
"19779380","19783320"," We're not trading fucking the fucking meme stock."
"19783320","19784160"," The week."
"19784900","19787200"," We're, and we're, you got to remember too, right?"
"19788260","19791540"," We're doing this with retailers in the daytime during cash. "
"19792060","19795520"," This isn't like, we have people here that trade globics and futures."
"19796080","19796880"," It's part of what we do."
"19797200","19803740"," But to be, to be like, hey, I'm going to try to find a retail trader and turn them out"
"19803740","19811040"," of the spy is kind of like, like, if you were forming a business, you wouldn't do that, right?"
"19811240","19812460"," You'd be like, okay, this is what we're going to do. "
"19812580","19816880"," I'm going to, you're going to put Jeff James in a polo shirt, a green, a light green polo."
"19816900","19818100"," He's going to part us here to the left."
"19818460","19822300"," He's going to get his teeth whitened, put some veneers on him, right?"
"19822400","19826240"," We're going to talk about the meme stocks that are being most talked about right now and stocked"
"19826240","19826540"," with. "
"19826860","19828820"," That's how you do it, right?"
"19829180","19829900"," We're not doing that."
"19830320","19836640"," Trying to like really take retailers and give them the fucking tools they need to be a legitimate"
"19836640","19837600"," market participant."
"19838420","19841660"," Take a look at Wall Street Bats. "
"19842180","19846600"," Take a look pre pre pre GME, right?"
"19847200","19852420"," I think I want to say at that time they had 150,000 members, right?"
"19853000","19853860"," And it grew fast."
"19854160","19858340"," It was like the last couple of years it was like 45,000, 150 "
"19858340","19866960",",000 really million all washed out."
"19867380","19868640"," Go back to Wall Street Bats right now. "
"19868720","19869300"," You know, nobody in there."
"19869380","19871320"," It's a great sub right now on Reddit."
"19871900","19876760"," It's doing great Wall Street Bats fucking back to what it was fucking awesome in my view. "
"19877280","19878940"," It really is back to where it was."
"19879140","19880460"," It's doing fucking banger."
"19880640","19884060"," But how many people are there, right?"
"19884460","19893280"," We've washed out so many fucking people out of this market from not GME, but from that COVID stay"
"19893280","19893880"," at home thing. "
"19895020","19902200"," And you know, the best way for me to make money is truthfully to be pushing like fucking meme"
"19902200","19904020"," stocks day in day out, right?"
"19904820","19907420"," Spinning yarns for you on a fucking live stream."
"19907580","19908260"," We don't do that here."
"19908520","19915860"," We're here to literally create a new generation of traditional retail traders. "
"19916680","19917120"," Legitimate."
"19917420","19918240"," You can take that away."
"19918380","19920380"," You can take everything you learn here away and trade it on memes. "
"19920420","19922700"," You can take it and trade it on anything you want."
"19923460","19926380"," Any fucking index, any fucking stock out there."
"19927920","19930420"," I'm like, oh, I'm in the rabbit hole on. "
"19930780","19931680"," I don't fucking know."
"19931860","19938320"," And some fucking, you know, like, like, like Nicola, right?"
"19938520","19939640"," Like, I only traded N."
"19939740","19943320"," Kelly L.A. and I believe in this company and all this stuff, right?"
"19944400","19947140"," In reality, you should have been learning to do what we're doing here."
"19947680","19951280"," So I have real belief in what we're fucking doing here. "
"19951500","19956120"," Like, I have a true deep fucking like hard on for this shit."
"19956340","19962100"," Like I'm fucking hard on for knowing that you're like making a fucking difference in a trader and"
"19962100","19962840"," investors life."
"19963460","19965460"," It's truly making a difference for the people. "
"19966200","19967420"," And you can't buy this shit."
"19967420","19971080"," There ain't no fucking, I know, I used to be a part of different discords and stuff."
"19971780","19973980"," And I used to have people train me and stuff. "
"19974140","19975520"," And all, I did everything you guys want to do."
"19975920","19977400"," He's paid a lot of money for that shit."
"19978000","19979160"," And those people are only available. "
"19979400","19983800"," They're usually one hour, two hours, three hours a week, where there was some other scam going on,"
"19984460","19986040"," or there was some pump and dump ship going on."
"19986260","19989720"," Like, what we're doing here is not fucking easy in any way, shape or form."
"19991220","19992680"," So stick around, man. "
"19993060","19993700"," Stick around."
"19993940","19995720"," It's not going to be easy, but we're going to get there."
"19996220","20000160"," I feel like, I feel like we're like star citizen right now. "
"20003540","20006660"," You guys know what a..."
"20006660","20008200"," Hold on, hold on."
"20008420","20008820"," I know."
"20010780","20012180"," Oh yeah, baby. "
"20012600","20013080"," Hot guys."
"20018440","20020320"," Now I would, there's a couple things here."
"20020480","20023580"," So as you're going to this close here, right, you're likely going to run it right up into the"
"20023580","20024080"," fucking bell. "
"20024560","20028480"," And then you might not even be able to short this shit until the open tomorrow because they could"
"20028480","20029920"," run this shit up in the overnight too."
"20030080","20034800"," So you either going to be selling that close with some put spreads or you wait for the open and"
"20034800","20036180"," sell the fuck out of it."
"20036660","20038060"," That's one or the other, in my view. "
"20039820","20041100"," So open it up there at 475."
"20041980","20043740"," Look for that fucking pin strike up there."
"20051280","20052800"," Oh, your four hours looking good. "
"20052960","20054140"," I haven't checked the four hour yet yet."
"20054140","20056360"," Both, both are trading haven't checked the four hour yet."
"20056600","20057040"," I will though. "
"20057540","20059220"," I got 475 as a sell."
"20059480","20067100"," So I got, I got four, 35 as a sell and then I got to buy down below at think"
"20067100","20067500"," four."
"20067960","20068280"," Let me check. "
"20082240","20083740"," Whoo, about 459."
"20085940","20086640"," Somewhere in there."
"20087240","20094960"," I know everybody's going to be like, we go to trade that for that for we trade that 462 and"
"20094960","20097280"," they're going to start CTA's will get out. "
"20097360","20098740"," We'll get fucked possible."
"20099080","20099700"," We'll deal with it."
"20099780","20100160"," We get there. "
"20102660","20104480"," Here's your R3 tag right now."
"20105220","20109100"," You got the RTX sell the upside at 475 18."
"20110200","20113200"," Remember that people are going to tell you that they're just getting long here. "
"20113200","20115100"," Remember that you just like bears, right?"
"20115780","20116780"," So I want to be a warning."
"20119440","20120740"," We're fucking bearing here."
"20120980","20126240"," Any fucking, I bet any fucking bear in this show will tell you that you'll hear me come in. "
"20126500","20129700"," You'll hear me come into this show and say to them, take your money and run."
"20131060","20131420"," Right?"
"20131580","20134960"," Even if we keep going down, take your money here and run or renegotiate."
"20136320","20140500"," I'm going to tell you that as a bull as we come up there at R3 right there, that RTX"
"20140500","20142000"," sell, RTX sell. "
"20143140","20144460"," Take your money and fucking run."
"20144700","20145100"," Do your thing."
"20146460","20149580"," Don't be like drinking the bull coolade up there either. "
"20157080","20158580"," I went over Tesla earlier."
"20158880","20164180"," I think Tesla squeezes up, but then it sells down into, I believe, I got it right here."
"20164240","20164900"," I'll show it to you over time. "
"20171800","20173640"," Go ahead, chart this for you this morning."
"20177220","20177840"," Here's Tesla."
"20186820","20188660"," Now my take on Tesla, right?"
"20189520","20195840"," As you're going to trade this up here, we're actually going to come back down possibly middle of"
"20195840","20196180"," this week. "
"20197080","20199080"," Now you may be like, cap your out of your fucking mind."
"20199240","20199560"," You're wrong."
"20200000","20201080"," Okay, I can be wrong. "
"20201220","20202120"," I don't mind being wrong."
"20202300","20205780"," This isn't the, this job here is not, you're right."
"20206880","20208140"," I'm going to put my screen up here. "
"20208960","20211240"," This job here is, you're not one, right?"
"20211420","20212920"," You guys already know that I'm wrong, right?"
"20213100","20214420"," I'm wrong all the time."
"20214580","20217100"," So let's say we don't sell this here, okay?"
"20219240","20219640"," Right?"
"20219940","20221180"," So you're trading this right here."
"20221340","20222860"," You still take your money and run up here. "
"20223040","20223640"," I don't give a fuck."
"20223820","20224500"," Take your money and run."
"20225120","20226620"," This is where you make your money. "
"20226880","20227940"," This is where bulls get fucked."
"20228800","20232820"," This is where bears are, bulls are scared, bulls are scared here."
"20233300","20235020"," Bulls are fucking FOMO right here. "
"20235120","20236320"," This is your place to make money."
"20237160","20237300"," Okay?"
"20238280","20240100"," Now I think we reverse to the downside."
"20241260","20242340"," Now let's say I'm wrong. "
"20244320","20245960"," You don't really care about that."
"20246440","20250660"," The only thing you're caring, I'm caring about is making the money in here, right?"
"20251160","20255880"," And then if we break above and we start to consolidate or distribute, right?"
"20256740","20261860"," But if we come back up here and this hourly comes up here and we can break through that previous"
"20261860","20266480"," high on that break above to 44, 45, I'll get along with you there again."
"20267160","20267760"," Does that make sense?"
"20268880","20271160"," I'll get along with you above from here higher. "
"20271860","20275200"," We can talk about going higher from here once we do that."
"20275400","20276300"," So that would look like this."
"20278120","20281420"," So let's say I'm, let's say, oh, cap's not bullish enough, man. "
"20282200","20282460"," Right?"
"20283180","20284100"," You trade up like this."
"20285440","20287080"," Come back down just like this."
"20287340","20289440"," This is how it goes every fucking time. "
"20290360","20291780"," Literally every time, right?"
"20292480","20293380"," We do that right there."
"20293920","20294100"," Yahoo."
"20294460","20294980"," That's the trade. "
"20295580","20298340"," And you'll have people out there in public going one fucking long, bro."
"20298600","20300020"," They actually got long like right here."
"20301260","20303880"," Then they start screaming at you telling you it's going to go higher. "
"20305560","20305800"," Right?"
"20305960","20309600"," So you're like, oh, yeah, I'm listening to that guy over there and you're getting long and it pulls"
"20309600","20310460"," back on you."
"20310520","20313480"," Now you're fucking upside down your calls because time's burning you."
"20313800","20317000"," In reality, you should have waited to take the next trade here. "
"20317680","20327380"," So the next trade here is the next bullish trade here would be"
"20327380","20330460"," beating that previous high right there, right?"
"20332300","20339160"," And you can start to grind this stuff out here and you can take that one right there."
"20339880","20344780"," But you also need the the hourly trigger to come with you and be at the right place."
"20345960","20353000"," Now, if the hourly trigger is super bullish, we know that this will probably break and it'll just"
"20353000","20354900"," be a trap for bulls the downside. "
"20356060","20360620"," So your daily trigger down here, I never like buying this daily trigger is a 30 minute chart."
"20361300","20362600"," I fucking hate buying this 30."
"20362800","20364340"," This I hate buying this here. "
"20364780","20368760"," And even though price is going up right now, this we have not here right now, are we?"
"20370140","20373860"," I'm showing you the daily is still losing its velocity."
"20374540","20378340"," So right here, we're bearish even though price is showing higher."
"20378860","20380860"," That's why I think we reverse to the downside. "
"20382120","20386280"," And what I think we're going to actually reverse down here because we're still losing velocity in"
"20386280","20386920"," the upside moves."
"20387520","20391520"," And to be honest with you, if you're going to be trading fucking Tesla specifically, you already"
"20391520","20392840"," know where your best trades are."
"20394300","20395480"," They already know where they are. "
"20395660","20397780"," They're down here and show them to you."
"20398480","20400580"," One right there, one right there."
"20400620","20401620"," That's your best fucking trades. "
"20402100","20403060"," Boom, boom."
"20403900","20404020"," Right."
"20404280","20405760"," So where do you want to be a buyer here?"
"20405920","20409060"," You can buy this, but let's say you wake up like that, right?"
"20409200","20410880"," Everybody's fucking pulled up right here. "
"20411200","20413580"," You wake up tomorrow and you're down like this, right?"
"20415300","20420320"," So all those people that were telling you that they're all pulled up in here, they disappear from"
"20420320","20421020"," the stream, right?"
"20421160","20424860"," They disappear from your Twitter, your Wall Street bets, where the fuck it is you're on."
"20425080","20428880"," Meanwhile, we blast down here and you go, oh, shit, cap was right."
"20429200","20430840"," I remember actually remember that trade. "
"20430960","20432300"," And I was like, now we're going down there."
"20432840","20433720"," Same thing over here."
"20434320","20434660"," Right. "
"20434760","20436760"," So just just think about this right here."
"20436760","20439180"," I don't think it's shocking at all to see that come down."
"20439760","20444000"," I don't think that's out of the realm of possibility at all right down there, right?"
"20444760","20447840"," And then boom, you're off the actual trade was right there for that next leg up. "
"20448660","20449480"," You know what I'm saying?"
"20449720","20454360"," So just on this stuff right here, we can trade above, but let's say we do, right?"
"20455420","20459540"," Let's say we let's say caps cap saying we're going to go down and retest this 227."
"20459660","20461020"," I think is a fucking liar."
"20461620","20463860"," Well, then you got to show me something else, right?"
"20464480","20468380"," You got to show me price action get up here, right?"
"20468620","20472680"," The hourly trigger come up and we start breaking above that and start heading higher. "
"20472840","20473140"," We do that."
"20473320","20476040"," I'll jump on board for that trade to the upside."
"20476980","20480700"," Otherwise down either at the close or the open tomorrow. "
"20481780","20491450"," If price can get up here, you run that when we look at this fucking thing, look at that goddamn"
"20491450","20492650"," gorgeousness right there."
"20493910","20499130"," That fucking boom down here, boom up here, you wake up tomorrow morning, all of a sudden it's down"
"20499130","20499430"," there."
"20500830","20504450"," Be really careful in here, really careful in here. "
"20504590","20504730"," Okay."
"20507610","20510590"," Open that open that chart up a little bit more than just the one minute."
"20520970","20522610"," Bring that over there so you can see it. "
"20526180","20530000"," That's that next gamma level four, seven, seven, five."
"20541680","20543400"," No, haven't looked at Amazon yet today."
"20544960","20545940"," That's another thing too. "
"20546620","20549960"," Like hoping like this should be some cool shit here too."
"20550200","20558540"," Like we're going to do this stock show even we've run it a couple times in the Sundays, but we"
"20558540","20561420"," need everybody to have the fucking tool and everybody to be in the same page."
"20561740","20562920"," We're going to have access to Amazon. "
"20563820","20565940"," This is like really cool part of what we're doing here."
"20566200","20568560"," I want to share some of you guys really cool."
"20569240","20575280"," So the way we're going to run this tool for the masses is if we can get the masses on"
"20575280","20581640"," the tool like thousand two thousand people and like your favorite ticker is Amazon or your favorite"
"20581640","20588060"," ticker is XXT and you're like, hey cap, we got a fucking six trigger bear cluster on this my"
"20588060","20588960"," favorite ticker here. "
"20589280","20591500"," Like you have that crowdsourcing of information."
"20591500","20595020"," It's going to be insane to be fucking insane."
"20595020","20595760"," I can't wait. "
"20596340","20597340"," Can't fucking wait."
"20601510","20602590"," You guys want to look at Amazon?"
"20608090","20609670"," Let's do a 30 minute Amazon."
"20610490","20613730"," Let's take a look at it. "
"20623860","20625160"," Here's Amazon right here."
"20625780","20626840"," Is that 30 minute chart on Amazon?"
"20652800","20653720"," Something like that."
"20653940","20654540"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"20654800","20655680"," Pull back into tomorrow."
"20655960","20656680"," That's what I'm hoping for."
"20658860","20661420"," And I want to see this hourly trigger come up here and cross. "
"20664320","20665720"," Yeah, I want to see that early trigger."
"20666220","20668280"," And I want to see it hold."
"20669840","20672520"," I want to see this hourly trigger come up test it. "
"20672680","20675100"," If it holds, if it holds, to go up."
"20675400","20680000"," If this hourly trigger does not hold on a back test on this daily trigger, it's going to be a"
"20680000","20680820"," fucking bloodbath."
"20681000","20682160"," We're going to head down to the depths of hell. "
"20685760","20688300"," Now 146.48, you need to hold that."
"20688820","20690440"," No matter where we go into the end of the day here."
"20692740","20696860"," Maybe we're going to go a little bit higher right there. "
"20698700","20702080"," Now possible 150 today, but you're going to recheck this down here."
"20703560","20721650"," These are"
"20721650","20722710"," our TX right there."
"20726390","20727870"," What else you guys talking about in here?"
"20734090","20735310"," Hey, what's up John Hagerty?"
"20736750","20737590"," How are you doing brother?"
"20737890","20738730"," Binky, how are you doing brother?"
"20741930","20743570"," Yeah, nobody wanted tech, man. "
"20753510","20755250"," That call says I'm hard too, bro."
"20757290","20758550"," Hey, Shaq, take these brother."
"20869930","20870830"," Hold on here. "
"20870830","20874790"," There's a beer sound sheriff."
"20877490","20879030"," Give you that five minute trigger."
"20890830","20898090"," Yeah, I guess the next question becomes do the bulls try to bring up that SPX 5000 on the quarter"
"20898090","20898750"," now, right?"
"20899490","20901230"," I'm assuming you're going to get the talk, right?"
"20902230","20904110"," What's the upside target on that SPX right now?"
"20904270","20904870"," Was it 5000?"
"20905890","20906770"," Yeah, caller. "
"20906950","20908790"," I bet everyone's like, how about that caller?"
"20911150","20912710"," We're going to crash into March."
"20912730","20914470"," You might as well hit the top end of that caller now."
"20982700","20984900"," I got a shit post on Twitter right now. "
"20998070","20998790"," Ah, shit."
"21091410","21092170"," No, I'm not."
"21092570","21093210"," Full for trading. "
"21093350","21093770"," I'll look it up."
"21095910","21097030"," Ned Davis, let me read."
"21097450","21097690"," Hold on. "
"21098710","21099430"," Hold on."
"21099510","21100430"," Can I cut and paste this?"
"21105350","21106070"," Hold on."
"21106210","21106690"," I'll write that down. "
"21106830","21107350"," Hold on a second here."
"21111250","21113470"," Ned Davis, mark it's a motion book."
"21113650","21113770"," Yep. "
"21114330","21115350"," I mean, I'm familiar with it."
"21119630","21121490"," The year ending in right up."
"21123310","21124910"," I'm not familiar with that. "
"21130190","21131130"," I'll write it down."
"21139400","21140540"," Yeah, I'll buy it bull for trading."
"21140840","21141060"," I do. "
"21141320","21143760"," I do subscribe to Trader's Almanac."
"21144620","21145520"," I use that."
"21152110","21154250"," I wrote down what's going on, Johnny Haggedy. "
"21154250","21155210"," What's going on, brother?"
"21155730","21156610"," What up, brother?"
"21160260","21162520"," Yeah, they're going to have to change the count right now, right?"
"21162960","21164740"," It depends on all where we close."
"21165060","21169220"," Someone just, I just reposted a guy who, that's why I'm looking at this guy right here, was his"
"21169220","21172880"," name is groan Simba."
"21173840","21178240"," He wrote spy going to wait for clothes before putting a counter into power hour, liking a wave one"
"21178240","21178800"," set up though. "
"21179920","21183240"," I bet you all the L.A. waivers are watching for this close 100%."
"21186580","21187820"," 100 fucking percent."
"21197110","21198410"," What's pricing to get a copy?"
"21198850","21201550"," 500 bucks or 300 bucks more than more than 300. "
"21203670","21206590"," Now, if they love to look at the price on it, let me look right now."
"21206730","21206910"," Hold on."
"21209290","21210770"," What's the price on it right now?"
"21221600","21223120"," Oh, it's a nice looking book too. "
"21226900","21229060"," Jesus, $990 fucking dollars?"
"21229440","21230800"," Get the fuck out of here."
"21233400","21235000"," You got your fucking mind."
"21237160","21238720"," Hold on, I got to look somewhere else. "
"21238900","21239760"," Can I buy it at the secondary?"
"21240080","21241820"," You guys are savages."
"21244280","21245600"," I'm looking at it out on Amazon."
"21245600","21246860"," It's for a thousand bucks. "
"21248840","21250460"," God damn, I'd have to look at it."
"21250520","21251440"," I'd have to see it in person."
"21264890","21265630"," Oh, wait a minute. "
"21265730","21266890"," Wait a minute."
"21266890","21267490"," 175 bucks."
"21268590","21270210"," I see one for 175 used. "
"21273850","21274970"," 150 I see one."
"21279490","21280410"," That's pretty reasonable."
"21282610","21283610"," What is this one here?"
"21285090","21286310"," Oh, people have it under. "
"21286650","21287610"," It looks like people have it."
"21287790","21289190"," Oh, no, I got to hear it a hardcover."
"21290150","21291650"," I don't know if this is a scam though. "
"21293830","21296170"," It says this hardcover is available for 50 bucks."
"21296370","21297390"," I don't know if I believe it though."
"21302020","21304360"," Sometimes I've gotten fucked buying books. "
"21307040","21311720"," I try to get hard or soft covers and then it's like an e-book scam."
"21313240","21314780"," As I call my bank and stuff."
"21316860","21319320"," Yeah, I just found one I think for 50 bucks. "
"21320840","21324960"," Think, don't quote, don't hold me to that because sometimes it's a scam."
"21325600","21328600"," I saw a few on eBay for 150 and one 75."
"21334650","21340410"," No, no, what they'll do is they'll sometimes I buy a lot of books and what they'll do is they'll"
"21340410","21344110"," take an expensive book that's like hundreds of dollars or thousands of dollars. "
"21344530","21347850"," They'll tell you to have it and then like the fine print they'll say it's an e-book."
"21347950","21351310"," So what they do is they scan that shit, try to sell it to you for 50 bucks."
"21355060","21357800"," The price that I see is on Amazon for a new copy. "
"21358080","21360860"," I don't know if that's like a single print or something like that."

"21468910","21473790"," We're making a base here, man, at 4750, at least on gamma we are. "
"21475710","21477130"," And we're making a base here."
"21477610","21479730"," Now, that's what that yellow line is right here."

"21591650","21592030"," I'm with you."
"21593910","21600450"," My forecasts are similar to what Larry Williams does, or what Larry Williams trade is all monac,"
"21600770","21604770"," and there's another guy that does some stuff that, plus what Larry Williams. "
"21605370","21608090"," I don't think Larry's come out with his jet for this year."
"21608970","21610330"," I'm interested to see what Larry does."

"21650590","21653070"," Bork, just like you're talking, just stop talking, Bork."
"21657290","21658090"," The SEC."
"21658750","21661090"," Hell, Razorback Bradley's in the house coming. "
"21662150","21663430"," He got the rub."
"21665450","21668650"," I wondered how many SEC boys and girls were in the house today."
"21669190","21670590"," There's a few of you out there, huh?"
"21675630","21676550"," Fuck it, eh?"
"21676990","21679130"," Fucking Dallas ain't fucking winning either. "
"21679710","21682490"," Fucking bullshit NFL, and the bullshit refs."
"21684190","21687310"," Fucking Travis, fucking Cowboys, same bullshit."
"21690220","21694600"," They don't want you fucking playing your playoff games in the fucking Detroit, do they?"
"21695880","21698580"," Fuck, no, they got to be a story, man. "
"21701400","21702840"," I'm just picking at you guys."
"21707260","21712800"," Joe Donut, Joe Donut's a Georgia, a Georgia like fan alumni guy."
"21713520","21716420"," And of course, Georgia, I think was number one, right?"
"21716720","21717660"," They didn't fucking make it. "
"21735860","21744630"," Yeah, I, so I didn't know the structure of that."
"21745130","21749770"," I didn't, I just, I just went down the rabbit hole on the Wikipedia on that on paying players."
"21751150","21752550"," I didn't know anything about it. "
"21752550","21755650"," I didn't like I knew it was going on, but I didn't know exactly what was going on."
"21755970","21756690"," I was shocked."
"21757770","21759830"," I'm shocked at how many people are making actual money. "
"21768820","21771280"," Jared, Jared's like easy on Georgia, bro."
"21772740","21774580"," Fucking stir in the shitpot in the chat."
"21775900","21777580"," Pissing off all the SEC right now. "
"21780180","21787080"," Don't forget, if you're in the SEC, we need you to be watching college ball bowl games so we can"
"21787080","21788020"," pay all these players."
"21792730","21795570"," Yeah, dude, the NFL, man, I don't know, dude."
"21796530","21799590"," I don't like the NFL, dude, is like the WWE, man. "
"21799990","21804110"," Not that the WWE is fake, but NFL, man."
"21804310","21809230"," It's just, it's just like full on blatant at this point."
"21809930","21812050"," And I was blaming the refs, but I can't. "
"21812170","21813910"," It's the fucking, it's the commission, man."
"21814390","21815310"," It's fucking commissioner."
"21815690","21815990"," It's the NFL. "
"21816810","21817590"," That's who it is."
"21818370","21819630"," It's all about, it's all about entertainment."
"21820190","21820810"," That's what it's about. "
"21825740","21826520"," Yeah, I know kidding, huh?"
"21827980","21831320"," Yeah, raise back Bradley saying, NFL deals for sure changing the game."
"21831340","21832800"," Arkansas raised back to Scrooge forever."
"21832920","21834020"," No good at all deals here. "
"21834180","21837360"," We got a patrino back after all the firing, man, M."
"21839700","21840680"," That's a fair point."
"21841180","21844560"," I got family down there in Arkansas."
"21845200","21846900"," Man, I've got a shit ton of money, do they?"
"21850460","21851760"," Or do you think it's, is it the viewership?"
"21852200","21853860"," What is the, what is the dynamics of it?"
"21853920","21854320"," Is it viewers?"
"21854800","21857240"," Is it, what does it based on?"
"21857240","21861220"," Like, is it based on how many people in your market or stuff like that?"
"21863160","21863900"," We got Walmart. "
"21865140","21866780"," I fucking love it down there, man."
"21867060","21868580"," I've been, I drove through the state once."
"21868820","21873320"," I went to, uh, wherever the mobsters hang out, they got all those fucking mansions with the marble"
"21873320","21874080"," and all that shit. "
"21874460","21874920"," That was cool."
"21875160","21875480"," That was fun."
"21876500","21879500"," That little main street that runs down there was like the hideout for the gangsters. "
"21880420","21883020"," They didn't even that town, but they had a blast in there."
"21889170","21892590"," Yeah, I was watching like, so like, I was, I watched the Lions game, right?"
"21893210","21897630"," Sitting in a fucking lodge and I'm watching a lot like, well, I didn't watch the entire game, but"
"21897630","21900150"," I, I showed up to the end of the Lions game, right?"
"21900410","21904770"," To check the last like 15, 20 minutes, some, the game ends, right?"
"21905710","21911310"," And they, everybody on, on Fox was like, like, just start sucking Dallas."
"21911830","21914930"," And I'm like, dude, you're not even gonna, you're not gonna give these guys the win and talk about"
"21914930","21915310"," their win. "
"21915310","21917570"," It was like, fuck no, just start sucking Dallas."
"21918550","21919950"," We need Dallas and the playoffs."
"21920110","21921750"," We need Dallas with some home filled advantage. "
"21922010","21923130"," Like it was just like crazy."
"21924150","21925150"," And I was just like, what?"
"21925350","21928610"," I was like, these guys are programmed like, it was just like, disappointed."
"21929670","21935270"," You know, like, like Patriots to some extent became one of those teams that like a Dallas team, but"
"21935270","21940770"," when Patriots weren't winning, uh, when, when Brady first was a rookie, it was not a, I think it"
"21940770","21945290"," was a, they're one year, but like his first year, they didn't want to give them any time, uh,"
"21945410","21950210"," second year by the third year, they, they, they became, started to become one of those teams where"
"21950210","21951390"," it's like a darling of the NFL. "
"21951610","21954270"," But the first two, three years, they didn't want to fucking hear it."
"21954930","21959350"," And if you were, if you're a Pats fan back then, you could see it right away."
"21959450","21960890"," You were like, this guy's a fucking winner. "
"21960970","21962070"," This guy's gonna win championships."
"21962970","21965710"," You know, hot springs, baby."
"21965710","21966090"," That's it. "
"21966230","21966550"," That's the place."
"21969330","21970370"," Oh, no shit, huh?"
"21971250","21974330"," I was kind of that, uh, Dorothe inspection was kind of weird."
"21975270","21978390"," That door to me is like, how does it even pop off?"
"21978890","21979590"," It's not even a door. "
"21979750","21980490"," It's a plug, right?"
"21982130","21983750"," Supposedly that it's kind of like a cork."
"21984050","21985130"," It didn't come out at all."
"21985830","21987790"," Um, people did talk, I was reading something. "
"21988090","21989950"," People were talking in the aviation subreddit."
"21990230","21994290"," They were talking about, like these are, there's like an aviation, uh, maintenance subreddit and"
"21994290","21994410"," Reddit."
"21995070","21997350"," And those guys were talking about the bolts too. "
"21998470","22001070"," Uh, but the bolts looked like they were deformed."
"22001870","22005210"," Uh, those plugs are like pretty confident."
"22005430","22008170"," Those, those, those plugs are not, those aren't doors, right?"
"22008470","22010150"," They say it's a door, but it really isn't a door. "
"22010530","22012830"," Like a permanent fucking, uh, blank."
"22025580","22027560"," Are you guys gonna buy puts in this closet?"
"22027780","22028440"," I'm thinking about it."
"22030040","22033100"," I think I'm gonna buy in some puts, but I'm like, oh, I wait till they open tomorrow. "
"22033420","22036780"," Like to do that bullshit when they run it up in the overnight and then we come back down and"
"22036780","22037540"," we're selling the open."
"22045330","22049530"," You're gonna take a look at the B.A. I used to trade B.A. That's a fucking other Widowmaker"
"22049530","22049910"," stock."
"22050310","22055470"," I used to trade B.A. Like I would, I would win really big on B.A. And then it"
"22055470","22058010"," would lose really big on B.A. I don't trade him anymore. "
"22061510","22062470"," Jesus Christ."
"22072070","22076070"," Um, man, um, one 30 minute chart."
"22076070","22080400"," How are you doing, Kitty?"
"22087600","22089080"," Nope, not a buy for me. "
"22094200","22104040"," Nope, not a buy for me."
"22108830","22110810"," Maybe you can retrace some of this stuff here."
"22111030","22115910"," It might be a retracement play here, but, um, not for me. "
"22121110","22122270"," I want to see 200."
"22124190","22125330"," I want to see 200."
"22129250","22131230"," I get the retracement here. "
"22131230","22133690"," If you want, if you want the retracement trade, here it is."
"22135070","22138010"," Uh, target 238, possibly 245."
"22139510","22140710"," I'll be honest with you. "
"22140830","22143450"," I want to see, um, 200."
"22143810","22148410"," I got, I got targets down below of 221, 39, 206, 18."
"22150550","22153350"," I was saying 200, but, uh, 206, 18. "
"22153810","22157550"," And, and they're not, they're, they're, uh, daily Vellos, not where it should be."

"22312860","22314120"," Uh, so that will be out."
"22314300","22315540"," That should be out today at some point. "
"22315720","22317260"," I should have it ready and done by the end of today."
"22326870","22329630"," Yeah, I get the retrace on, on BA."
"22330010","22331330"," I get your sell and puts on it. "
"22331710","22333450"," Sell them under 200 bucks, please."
"22333870","22335630"," Please tell me your sold puts that are like."
"22337010","22337950"," Then I guess you're right. "
"22338050","22339730"," It doesn't matter if you do get a sign does it."
"22339750","22340930"," That's actually a fair point too."
"22341130","22341590"," Who said that?"
"22341750","22342090"," Bull for trade?"
"22342630","22343430"," No, I understand that. "
"22343650","22344490"," Sell puts on it."
"22344570","22345390"," That makes sense to me."
"22346110","22350690"," Um, and you actually don't care if you get a sign down there because it is going to go back"
"22350690","22350930"," up. "
"22353510","22354430"," That's not a bad trade."
"22354990","22355670"," I like that idea."
"22360200","22361600"," To the point, what's going on, brother?"
"22362600","22363760"," Happy Monday, baby. "
"22372190","22374330"," The bolts falling out, whatever's holding the series together."
"22375470","22387190"," Yeah, I"
"22387190","22389490"," think it's going to be, oh, it's not bad."
"22389850","22390230"," So I was. "
"22391730","22394190"," If you guys ever do it, do yourself a solid, right?"
"22394190","22396350"," Go to the aviation maintenance subreddit."
"22396990","22400390"," And there were guys, so the night they pulled those planes, right?"
"22400810","22409270"," They were fucking guys posting pictures of the inspections going on in the aviation maintenance"
"22409270","22409830"," subreddit."
"22409990","22416130"," I was reading what they were saying because they were talking about the time it takes to do the"
"22416130","22416550"," inspection. "
"22416610","22421690"," So when they grounded the fleet, X number of planes went to different airports around the country."
"22422650","22425650"," And there were people, they're actual, it's not the inspect."
"22425950","22430410"," People were trying to get them to come out and say they were inspectors so they could like hunt"
"22430410","22432150"," them down and fucking bust them. "
"22432450","22434590"," They were like, no, no, I'm just a guy on the plane right now."
"22434710","22435830"," They would take pictures of the inspections."
"22436610","22438610"," But people were saying like, how long it would take to do the inspections?"
"22439470","22443350"," How long it would take to change all the doors out?"
"22444790","22447510"," They were discussing why they should never fly off. "
"22448110","22451410"," Like they should, even if the bolts fail, they're not supposed to fly off."
"22453450","22454710"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"22454970","22456050"," Squeeze it up there. "
"22456810","22459110"," Give me that 47, 5, 18, please."
"22460350","22462270"," Or 47, 5, I'll take that."
"22470050","22471670"," That's PX squeezing right now. "
"22472490","22474130"," You watch these shorts, man."
"22474470","22476210"," All these fucking bears are going to get squeezed."
"22476470","22477510"," The fuck out here. "
"22491310","22491990"," That's right."
"22492230","22492810"," That's right."
"22493110","22493610"," That's right. "
"22494630","22496130"," Keep on squeezing, baby."
"22502370","22503130"," That's right."
"22505750","22506690"," Right up in there. "
"22506750","22507410"," Yeah, that's right."
"22507590","22507870"," Get up there."
"22507970","22508410"," Take a look. "
"22607500","22609660"," Bork McGork's like faces all blown up."
"22610000","22610140"," Is it?"
"22610300","22610760"," Wait, wait, is it?"
"22610840","22611100"," No, is it?"
"22611200","22613840"," Go try and podcast faces all blown up."
"22614040","22614840"," Bork's taking a flight. "
"22617340","22644140"," Let me"
"22644140","22644860"," see what I got here."
"22720410","22721250"," Oh, shit."
"22728670","22732010"," I've been digging the yield max ETFs for dividends, but they're not traditional dividend stocks. "
"22732290","22735090"," I could probably have mine, but you've got a couple of grand a month flowing in from them for the"
"22735090","22735750"," past five months."
"22735870","22736270"," It's been nice."
"22737030","22740150"," Bork's bringing up the yield max ETFs for dividends. "
"22742670","22744070"," I don't know what else we got here."
"22744330","22745350"," Let's see what you guys are talking about."
"22779610","22782350"," What do you think is Chase still here?"
"22785860","22787100"," Chase, what did Bread say?"
"22792170","22793370"," What did Bread say, bro?"
"22804270","22806810"," Yeah, Ian's saying is put pieces could ground their fleet. "
"22807190","22810510"," You guys get into the aviation subreddit."
"22810790","22812330"," Well, you can just go in there and ask those guys."
"22812390","22812930"," I'll tell you. "
"22814070","22815690"," Like, what's the expectation here?"
"22816030","22817470"," They ground in this fucking fleet or not."
"22817990","22818770"," Don't tell me."
"22819250","22823510"," Do the drop account for some kind, some like alt account on Reddit. "
"22823890","22828270"," You don't want to have any kind of history at Wall Street Bets, but go in there and snoop around."
"22830190","22830990"," That's what I do."
"22833970","22835490"," I got my like, how are you doing kids?"
"22850890","22851690"," What up, Will?"
"22855810","22856770"," 14 minutes left. "
"22858810","22861730"," These guys are going to try to sell this close, right?"
"22861990","22865290"," Just as a quick thing here, okay?"
"22866110","22868390"," Get out of that five-minute, one-minute trade."
"22869390","22871490"," So take a look at a 30-minute chart here, okay?"
"22884290","22886390"," Now, just take a look at this with me here, okay?"
"22891100","22892800"," So just be calm, okay?"
"22893560","22895900"," Come down to your first one, right?"
"22896720","22897660"," The distribution."
"22898920","22900320"," What do they call this, a B-wave?"
"22900540","22901780"," I think if you're an L-A waiver. "
"22905260","22906560"," Now, hold on here."
"22910740","22911600"," Does that work?"
"22915810","22918190"," One, two, three, right?"
"22920410","22923710"," If you want to ex all that out in your bull, right?"
"22923710","22925170"," We're trading up here right now."
"22925310","22928570"," What do you want to see if you're a bull, right?"
"22928590","22931530"," You want to see actually a high, right?"
"22934970","22936990"," Something like that, okay?"
"22937210","22942170"," Otherwise, you are taking the money and running, and even if you're going to buy this, it's over"
"22942170","22942450"," here. "
"22942570","22943630"," It's not right here, is it?"
"22943790","22946410"," So you're exiting even if you are wanting to get long, right?"
"22948690","22952130"," You can day trade this up if you want, if they sell this here."
"22952130","22954930"," Get yourself a double top or some shit like that."
"22955470","22957210"," But just be warned in here, okay?"
"22957850","22962570"," Just be warned in here that you're like, you're not like, you were long down here for Friday,"
"22962570","22963010"," right?"
"22963210","22965970"," Thursday and Friday, you're long down here. "
"22968010","22970050"," Remember, you were long down here, right?"
"22970710","22974010"," So anyone saying that they're long right here, like, do you need all this?"
"22974230","22975270"," Fuck no, you don't need all that."
"22976370","22983250"," You're trying to either sell this down, or you're trying to buy not that, but this."
"22984250","22986530"," You can beat all this, then you can take that right there. "
"22987250","22990850"," Be aware of where you are, your situational awareness in the market, okay?"
"22992270","22996770"," And also remember that that one hour trigger is down here."
"22997350","23001930"," So even if we do go higher, let's say they roll us down, right?"
"23002130","23003890"," You can hold that to get back up here."
"23004130","23005790"," That's pretty bullish right there, right?"
"23006530","23007310"," Something like that. "
"23007310","23014670"," So, you know, fuck traditional charting and stuff, but be like, remember, remember that this move's"
"23014670","23016250"," already a pappin' hat, okay?"
"23016910","23020470"," So even if it squeezes up, you want to be then taking that there, right?"
"23020710","23022750"," Trading that move right there is a good trade."
"23024070","23026770"," But there is no good trade for a bull at this point."
"23034870","23036350"," Even right here, same chart. "
"23040580","23042060"," We just think about this, right?"
"23043280","23044280"," Squeeze up here, right?"
"23044880","23045780"," Get him out of there."
"23046380","23051140"," Meanwhile, the alley triggers bumping up, bumping up, bumping up, bumping up, eight, twelve hours,"
"23052020","23052760"," roll down."
"23053240","23055260"," Your next buy is actually down there, isn't it?"
"23056280","23056420"," Right?"
"23056960","23059720"," So your next bull buy is down here. "
"23060100","23061620"," It's not fuckin' right here."
"23062900","23068420"," This is close your trades, take the money and run, look for the next dip buy if you're bullish over"
"23068420","23069160"," here, if this holds."
"23070340","23073360"," We start to break above this stuff up here, okay?"
"23078840","23079720"," Just be cool. "
"23095780","23096700"," Just be cool."
"23096980","23098600"," Even if we trade up here, just be cool."
"23103400","23105280"," Let's say you got something like this, right?"
"23105420","23106560"," We blast up here, right?"
"23109280","23111260"," And then this shit happens, right?"
"23111400","23113980"," We bleed down to where the hourly trigger is down here. "
"23114820","23118680"," That's the actual next run, or the next time for you to buy."
"23119280","23123200"," Remember too, when this happens, when this happens, right?"
"23123440","23125180"," You're gonna have bulls that are too scared, right?"
"23125180","23126120"," You're not gonna wanna buy that?"
"23129240","23133460"," You're gonna tell you it's gonna roll, it might roll, but you're the guy buying this shit."
"23134160","23135040"," You're not buying this. "
"23135320","23136960"," You're already in from down there."
"23146050","23150330"," I guess if you wanted to run some zero dates into the bell here in the last five minutes or"
"23150330","23153170"," so, but creepy crawly up the wallie or something."
"23153870","23154950"," Nine minutes left to close. "
"23161830","23163610"," All right, I'll see you guys tomorrow."
"23164370","23167370"," So not right now, but next 10 minutes, I'll see you guys tomorrow at 9.30 in the morning."
"23167850","23169310"," I'll be here on time with you guys. "
"23169670","23171890"," Like we were this morning, I think it was early, five minutes early this morning."
"23172270","23174370"," Should be here on time with you guys tomorrow morning, no problems."
"23174590","23180590"," I do have to give you one programming note here, an important programming note for the rest of this"
"23180590","23181490"," week, okay?"
"23182930","23185950"," Wednesday and Thursday, there is a major storm. "
"23186670","23188070"," I think it's coming from the south."
"23189530","23192450"," Some of you guys are gonna run into this today and tomorrow, probably."
"23193350","23199850"," That storm, when it comes to where I live, they're saying I'm gonna get 40 mile an hour winds, 40"
"23199850","23204070"," plus mile an hour winds on the Thursday, I believe. "
"23205150","23209490"," We're not getting the snow, but we're supposed to get the rain, but major, major high winds."
"23210010","23213490"," So it is possible that my internet goes down."
"23213810","23215070"," I don't think that happens. "
"23216250","23218090"," They did so much, so many repairs."
"23218930","23221310"," So my internet and electricity went down."
"23222890","23227670"," Fucking like, there was one year where it went down, when we were streaming, it went down like, I"
"23227670","23233250"," kid you not like seven or eight times that year, but they've done so much, so many infrastructure"
"23233250","23236970"," repairs where I live, the last few storms, I have not lost power. "
"23238510","23245410"," So I don't, I'm not anticipating that lose power, but just the heads up in advance, if you're like,"
"23245410","23248510"," where's cap, Detroit's lost power."
"23249350","23251790"," You can just check, of course, on your own."
"23251790","23253710"," If you're like, where's Captain Y isn't he fucking here?"
"23253730","23255550"," Just be like, oh, is the power out in Michigan?"
"23256650","23258550"," You'll see horse lover fat will go down. "
"23258630","23261170"," Guys like him and I from Michigan, our power will go out."
"23263890","23269030"," I know, I don't think we are, knock on what, I think we will."
"23269470","23276630"," So the last two or three major incidents in Detroit, my part of the grid has not gone down with"
"23276630","23276830"," them. "
"23279530","23285350"," But I think that's because my neighborhood went down fucking like, it was like, there was like"
"23285350","23291550"," weeks, there was one time, there's one time, there's two times, but one during the stream in the"
"23291550","23294290"," past couple of years, three years, two and a half years, what fuck it is."
"23295050","23299550"," I think we started streaming in like August or something of three years ago or two, I don't know."
"23300790","23303970"," Anyways, I lost power for like two or three weeks. "
"23306150","23307390"," It was wild."
"23309570","23312430"," I bet they fucking run this right up into that bell, dude."
"23312590","23313790"," Just smash it up into the bell. "
"23316690","23325090"," But you've got, you've got, my point here is that I don't know if that's going to happen, it's"
"23325090","23325390"," possible."
"23325870","23326830"," I fucking hope it doesn't."
"23326930","23335390"," I have a generator and all that stuff and I do have, I do have a buried cable now, I"
"23335390","23335610"," believe. "
"23336290","23336710"," I'm not sure."
"23337970","23342790"," It's A-T-T fiber, I switched from, remember I was having problems with the internet, I switched to"
"23342790","23352670"," fiber internet, expensive as fuck, but we have fiber now, so I don't know if that goes"
"23352670","23353430"," down or not."
"23354090","23358510"," I don't think that it does, but I think that shit's buried, most of it's buried, I think. "
"23360950","23362410"," I don't think I lose power."
"23364650","23366330"," Tater, Tater Red one brother."
"23367610","23368490"," What's up brother?"
"23371270","23371850"," What's going on?"
"23378050","23379270"," You're hitting GR tonight?"
"23380430","23381210"," Where are you going Ian?"
"23386600","23388400"," Is it really, it's hitting you tonight?"
"23388740","23389780"," Let me know what's going on with that. "
"23393920","23401380"," So, RGF, just hang out, just hang out in RGF, just hang out."
"23402180","23403200"," Just chill man."
"23403340","23405500"," What did I say, Q1 and FQ1?"
"23406600","23407880"," Well, we'll look back on it. "
"23408060","23415360"," I want you to set a cell like $4, $6, whatever you want and then we'll re-look at it."
"23415500","23417640"," Make sure you have a fucking pre-sell on that shit."
"23418600","23422720"," If you're in RGF, be now in a Q1. "
"23423440","23428700"," Pick your poison for a cell point and we'll look back on it at the end of Q1."
"23428820","23430540"," I don't think you're going to be in that trade any longer."
"23435850","23438790"," Yeah Ian, I've got people in Georgia say it's coming to them too. "
"23438890","23440570"," They're going to get 40 mile an hour wins too."
"23441630","23445070"," What sucks for us too is our power lines are not buried here."
"23446150","23447370"," It's a big fucking scam. "
"23450500","23451260"," Yeah, you are."
"23456280","23457620"," You got young kids too?"
"23458060","23459380"," Yeah, that stuff's all sketchy man."
"23459520","23465700"," So what I did for myself was when I first moved, so I lived in the mountain town, so everything"
"23465700","23466160"," is buried. "
"23466760","23468560"," Like you never lost anything, right?"
"23468840","23474620"," So then I moved to Detroit, Michigan and I had to do all kinds of crazy shit."
"23474820","23480580"," Like I took my furnace and I hooked it up to a battery start."
"23481240","23483220"," So the first, when I first moved here, right?"
"23483740","23485780"," We had the first month I moved here. "
"23485900","23487780"," We lost power for three weeks in the middle of winter."
"23488400","23489900"," It was like 20s and lower."
"23491320","23496960"," So I had to like Jimmy Rigg, my furnace. "
"23497720","23499400"," I took the furnace, right?"
"23499760","23501700"," I put a kill switch on it."
"23502780","23508500"," And then I and then I had a battery hooked up to it to run the fucking fan so that"
"23508500","23510580"," I wouldn't lose at the gas running into the furnace."
"23510580","23513340"," And then I had a battery that I ran the furnace with. "
"23513820","23517440"," That was the first time when I first moved here, like there was no I couldn't get a generator and"
"23517440","23517960"," all that stuff."
"23518560","23519980"," I'm like, what the fuck do I do now?"
"23520440","23522480"," And of course I had to like army that shit."
"23529780","23531040"," The underground is great. "
"23532020","23533340"," Underground is where it's at man."
"23534460","23540360"," Like for the like the places where I lived, all the places that I lived were like minus 50 in"
"23540360","23540900"," the middle of winter."
"23541900","23549080"," Sometimes eight, 10 feet of snow, fucking Santa Anna, they call them the trade winds would come"
"23549080","23550040"," through twice a year. "
"23550800","23551420"," Like hellacious."
"23552480","23554340"," And I've never lost power."
"23554580","23556120"," Never not once. "
"23557600","23558280"," Never lost power."
"23558600","23559160"," Never lost gas."
"23559540","23560000"," Never lost anything. "
"23560320","23562560"," Plus we have like most of it's like propane in a tank."
"23563760","23565680"," I've never had any problems with anything."
"23566240","23570520"," Move to like Detroit, fucking if they have the fucking windfarts here, they lose power. "
"23571480","23573160"," And they charge bank here."
"23573360","23577480"," So Michigan's power cost is like number two in the country."
"23577660","23579360"," I think only Texas is higher. "
"23580160","23583700"," It's a fucking grift where I live, fucking total fucking grift."
"23584200","23590400"," And the worst part about where I live is that people that are only from Michigan don't understand"
"23590400","23590980"," that."
"23591580","23593320"," They don't have any fucking clue. "
"23594000","23595480"," They think it's like cool and shit."
"23595580","23596300"," The badge of honor."
"23596440","23598340"," I'm like, you're getting fucking bent over here. "
"23598940","23602100"," And then they say crazy shit like it be too costly."
"23602100","23603660"," I'm like, what are you talking about?"
"23604540","23610560"," Like, do you guys like I was like, you realize the biggest fucking states in the country bury all"
"23610560","23611040"," their shit."
"23612060","23614780"," Like you're out of your fucking mind if you think this is normal. "
"23620780","23623120"," I'm telling you, dude, you live in Birmingham right on."
"23623160","23624200"," I like Birmingham, by the way."
"23624740","23625580"," It's a nice fucking town. "
"23626200","23627480"," Hang out there every once in a while."
"23627560","23628400"," It's pure Michigan, man."
"23630640","23631760"," It's not the book. "
"23631960","23633400"," Dude, it's cause they're ripping it."
"23633480","23634540"," Dude, what are we at right now?"
"23634800","23637200"," DTE has raised us since COVID."
"23637680","23638540"," How much have they raised this?"
"23638640","23639700"," I just looked at my bills, dude. "
"23640440","23641460"," My DTE bills."
"23641780","23643360"," I have three DT bills, right?"
"23643920","23647520"," I'm fucking my eyes are bleeding out of my face right now on those bills."
"23648380","23649980"," The last increase that we just had. "
"23650460","23652580"," Fuck DTE straight up."
"23652760","23653200"," Fuck those guys."
"23653400","23654340"," Where are they way up right now?"
"23654520","23656600"," Since COVID, I think we're up like 17%. "
"23656600","23658660"," This is that I think it's that high."
"23658940","23660020"," The rate increases here."
"23660840","23663220"," They grew up like 17% or something insane. "
"23663800","23664600"," That's insanity."
"23666900","23669820"," Thurston, did you get your bill yet?"
"23670400","23671940"," Did you get your winter bill just now, bro?"
"23672420","23672960"," Have you seen it?"
"23675600","23676720"," Yeah, it's same."
"23683310","23684750"," Right on Ian, you too, man. "
"23688450","23689370"," You can't look."
"23692830","23697490"," Dude, I'm like, I had a like, and then, and then here's the worst part."
"23698010","23701550"," So I've got all these houses on smart thermostats, right?"
"23702790","23705990"," My wife is like, my wife was like breaking out there. "
"23706210","23708290"," The DTE is like, well, you did really good at this."
"23708290","23709290"," You did really good at that."
"23709450","23712390"," You did really good at this, but it still costs you fucking $700 this month. "
"23713490","23715750"," And my wife's like, well, we're doing everything we're supposed to be doing."
"23716010","23722090"," They're like, you got all the because I run, I do the discount, like, like warm the houses up, cool"
"23722090","23722950"," the houses down."
"23723690","23727210"," Then we committed like, I think it's like six, seven o'clock or something or four p.m. to seven"
"23727210","23734230"," p.m. Everything, turn it all down, then bring it back up again after the seven p.m. That's true. "
"23734610","23735570"," Look at your story."
"23737630","23738550"," Take it easy, problem."

"23749570","23752810"," Like, what, what cost went up 25%?"
"23761430","23762710"," That's like pure I was thinking about it."
"23763070","23764630"," Well, I was thinking about the pallet. "
"23764710","23767870"," So we used to do rootwood selves, but now I want to do a pallet stove."
"23769990","23771670"," Hey, any Nelson, good to see you, brother."
