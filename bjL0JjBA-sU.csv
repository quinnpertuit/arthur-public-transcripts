"2203080","2204680"," All right, can you guys hear me out there?"
"2221200","2224380"," Should be able to check one, two, check."
"2237300","2238560"," See if you guys can hear me."
"2246700","2247020"," All right. "
"2248340","2251080"," So look at what's going on in the spy right now."
"2252560","2254620"," Spy's about to squeeze, right?"
"2255820","2258120"," You guys see all these sellers."
"2267360","2269240"," Those clear sky moments, right?"
"2271740","2273600"," It's gonna be a rocket ship here coming up in just a second. "
"2276260","2278280"," See if you guys can hear me."
"2282060","2290210"," This is out of the spy right now."
"2291170","2293750"," And I was about to squeeze, right?"
"2295310","2295930"," 47750. "
"2296430","2297270"," All these sellers."
"2297730","2298830"," So let me get this over here."
"2300690","2305670"," So you got 47.50 as your first target. "
"2306310","2307610"," Second target's 480."
"2310010","2311810"," Tesla's doing the same thing right now."
"2312990","2316870"," You probably start seeing squeeze and all over the place on Apple spy. "
"2319360","2321320"," Yeah, Apple's about to squeeze itself."
"2325530","2326810"," AMD broke through."
"2327550","2329150"," That was a play we looked at earlier. "
"2334180","2334880"," Excuse me."
"2335640","2337860"," And on Tesla, same thing."
"2337980","2341760"," You're looking for a break above 1120 and you've got clear skies to 1150. "
"2341760","2345140"," If you guys want to scroll over here, look at your comments."
"2345320","2348560"," If you guys want me to look at any specific plays, let me know."
"2362440","2363440"," Give me a second here. "
"2404430","2406970"," So this is pretty critical where we're at right now in the market."
"2406970","2408870"," You can see that there's a push."
"2409270","2416350"," I'm going to check out Apple as well because we really need these stocks to be squeezing if it's"
"2416350","2418170"," going to squeeze the spy above. "
"2418170","2427220"," It's crazy too because these, it was December 4th or excuse me, the December 27th calls."
"2428420","2431180"," The 478's were two pennies earlier this morning."
"2432180","2433060"," They were even less. "
"2433300","2435860"," They were a penny earlier this morning."
"2436060","2437200"," So now they're up to 4 cents."
"2438480","2442140"," If we squeeze the 478, I mean, you're talking 99 cents. "
"2442520","2443000"," That's, that's insane."
"2443000","2450340"," It would have to be a straight shot though to get it because the dealers and the market makers will"
"2450340","2452140"," just bleed them off even if we get there."
"2452840","2455520"," But you see right here, you see this critical point in Apple right now. "
"2455920","2457980"," See this rejection here at 179."
"2459180","2465200"," And you see how the sellers, I want you guys to see this that you've got some sellers, but these"
"2465200","2466420"," are hidden sellers here."
"2466420","2473460"," These sellers just came in to the market and you have to have some concern for this rejection here"
"2473460","2480060"," because you, you've got supply above that are looking for bulls to. "
"2480740","2485320"," Let's say you're taking along an Apple and you say, Hey, we're going to squeeze here like I'm"
"2485320","2485640"," saying."
"2486420","2491260"," And then if you see rejection, this is a pretty significant rejection here on Apple."
"2491260","2493320"," So it does lend some concern. "
"2493740","2495780"," What will happen typically in these situations?"
"2496040","2499540"," Let's say we, we do have the chance to squeeze here."
"2500020","2504920"," But I want you to understand too, at the same time that when you get to these levels up here,"
"2504920","2506340"," this is a prime example."
"2508520","2514540"," Algorithms will make you think we're going to squeeze through and then they'll just dump shares on"
"2514540","2514720"," you. "
"2515500","2521460"," And so we go back down and people say that you're just wearing out sellers until we can squeeze"
"2521460","2524900"," through these positions and that is somewhat true."
"2525640","2529620"," And we are in that situation being in the Santa rally."
"2530560","2534840"," And we have some really good bid in the market, especially in Apple right now. "
"2535220","2540480"," So it's not to say that we won't go above, but when you are taking these trades, it's good for"
"2540480","2545920"," you to be buying these dips, then selling the rips and wait to break through for the next move"
"2545920","2546300"," above."
"2546880","2547800"," This isn't really good."
"2549760","2555850"," I want to show a better or a better or a prime example, right?"
"2555970","2559890"," Your price target on Apple, you're looking for 190 and then 200. "
"2560850","2563010"," But breaking through this level here is a challenge."
"2563790","2569730"," And when you see supply coming in to sell at these levels, it's dangerous."
"2570210","2573450"," So let's say you want to say you're like, okay, I want to take Apple to 190. "
"2573450","2576010"," Let's say in your mind, you're like, I'm going to buy a 190 call."
"2577330","2579550"," You see that there's no supply below here."
"2579770","2582230"," That's a good sign for bulls that we are going to 190. "
"2582830","2583650"," So what do you do?"
"2583690","2585430"," What do you do to trade this into Friday?"
"2585710","2592070"," You can buy yourself some 190 calls or some spreads for 190 of expire or 185 would be safer."
"2593010","2596630"," But then think to yourself, how do I hedge this bet right here?"
"2597150","2602010"," And how you would hedge this bet is you're just going to buy yourself some penny puts on the spy"
"2602010","2602550"," against."
"2603090","2603610"," Apple. "
"2604210","2606890"," You buy them for like four cents, two cents, one penny."
"2607670","2610450"," And you buy them each day for each OPEC's."
"2610990","2613210"," So you buy the OPEC's for today. "
"2613310","2614770"," You buy the OPEC's for Wednesday."
"2615670","2622350"," Once today's puts are dead at the end of the day, like 4 p.m. You could buy Wednesday's five"
"2622350","2622930"," cent puts."
"2623290","2628890"," If you believe in us hitting 190, it just adds that little bit of protection to the trade that"
"2628890","2629350"," you're taking. "
"2630110","2635430"," You guys all understand that out there the concept of you going along when we're in danger, when"
"2635430","2636070"," we're at resistance."
"2638530","2644130"," It's not that we're not going to 480 because we are, but you can also offset your trade with with"
"2644130","2645210"," their cheap plays."
"2645550","2654880"," I mean, I'm looking at, I'm looking at, you know, 470 P's right now on"
"2654880","2657260"," Apple or inspire two pennies. "
"2657460","2657960"," It costs nothing."
"2659240","2659480"," They're cheap."
"2660060","2665820"," So let's say you make a trade for a hundred bucks on the on Apple, then you trade as well. "
"2666560","2671480"," Call it like 25 bucks on or 20 bucks on or 10 bucks on."
"2672220","2677820"," You have to scale up to whatever you're trading, but put a little bit of hedge on there at like"
"2677820","2680660"," 470 P."
"2681040","2685380"," And then at the end of the day, let's say we continue up with Apple and that you burn down"
"2685380","2686340"," that two pennies."
"2686880","2690920"," For a much larger move in Apple, you can do the same thing at the end of the day for"
"2690920","2693080"," Wednesday protecting your trade. "
"2694140","2695520"," You guys all understand that out there?"
"2696220","2698140"," I'll make sure you guys are clear on that stuff."
"2701600","2710750"," Hey Dave, quarterly expiration on the 31st shouldn't there be a sell off on or around that day."
"2711250","2717390"," So my plan for you guys in my previous videos have given you what my expectations are for the"
"2717390","2719110"," market as we head into the 31st. "
"2720390","2728650"," On or my trading plan right now is I am long to 480 on the spy and corresponding stocks right"
"2728650","2730370"," like Tesla and Apple."
"2732970","2734510"," So that's what I'm looking for."
"2734890","2736370"," Do we go higher than 480?"
"2737310","2738350"," Yeah, I think we do. "
"2738570","2744010"," I think we can go to 483, maybe slightly higher 485 and then maybe ricochet 45."
"2745870","2750490"," I'm looking for that long trade into Friday, but this is what else I'm thinking out there."
"2751050","2756410"," And that is that the JPM caller trade is going to become front and center. "
"2757030","2764310"," When we get up around 480, 483, you'll hear it in the news or your social media feeds."
"2764530","2766350"," You'll see it up posted everywhere."
"2767130","2772370"," And that is an indication to you that it's going to be looked at as some negative news. "
"2772370","2773790"," So how do I trade that?"
"2774090","2776490"," I want to trade weakness in the markets."
"2778250","2784810"," Traditionally, I would trade the weakness in the markets at the close on Friday into January 3."
"2785670","2793850"," But because we're all intertwined in this market, I'm afraid that it'll come slightly earlier."
"2794350","2799110"," You might see profit taking closer to Thursday Friday. "
"2800010","2801650"," So what is the plan, right?"
"2801870","2805530"," The plan would be that you stick to what your trading plan is."
"2805910","2810450"," I'm looking for what 470 that I'm looking for 478, 480."
"2811630","2815090"," And I really don't care if we go to 483 or 485. "
"2815610","2816450"," I'm going to take my money."
"2816450","2823070"," I'm going to run and I'm going to look for when we hit real resistance, where we ricochet, and then"
"2823070","2827350"," I'm going to play that with a bearish trade."
"2827350","2830230"," And where are those numbers at, right?"
"2830330","2831190"," We know it's 478. "
"2831430","2832090"," We know it's 480."
"2835340","2837800"," If you're ultra uber, super bullish."
"2838220","2840120"," So you got it right here 47750. "
"2840700","2842280"," 480 is the next resistance."
"2843320","2846600"," You'll hear talk of us going to 483, 485."
"2847580","2848720"," That's on the table. "
"2848720","2854340"," I can't say that that's not on the table, but I will more than likely be taking that short."
"2855120","2856340"," There is clear skies above here."
"2857580","2858460"," Above 480. "
"2859460","2864620"," So the reality, though, is you're probably where probably reality is you'll hear talk about 483, 4,"
"2865060","2866160"," so they can get this right."
"2867060","2871680"," You'll hear talk of us going to 483, 485 somewhere up there."
"2873400","2877780"," But the reality is you're going to meet resistance at 47750, 480. "
"2878420","2880840"," You're going to get resistance at 480."
"2880840","2887300"," And you'll probably see that timed up around profit taking."
"2887580","2891080"," You'll start to see people take profit and get out of the market. "
"2891280","2892440"," You don't have to win every single trade."
"2892900","2894440"," You don't have to have all the money."
"2895260","2897240"," We're hitting some good trades here, right?"
"2897480","2899280"," We're taking some slamming profit. "
"2900620","2906520"," And we talked last night about the ratio of how many trades you need to hit 100, 300, 500 percent"
"2906520","2909440"," versus your 20 percent."
"2911240","2914740"," Trades and maybe like, let's say you take three losses on every 10 trades."
"2916280","2919220"," So you have to hit at least, you know, two or three out of the park. "
"2921660","2923580"," So I still haven't picked up any new trades."
"2924680","2928820"," I'm still looking for that 474 because that's how I trade."
"2930220","2931840"," I trade very safe. "
"2933760","2938420"," Although there's no issue with you taking this trade here at where we're at."
"2938420","2948320"," You can take the 477 or the 488 or the 488C into Friday and with a"
"2948320","2949120"," little bit of hedging."
"2949360","2952080"," That's all you need to do, just a little bit of hedging to cover that trade. "
"2952660","2957400"," And then you can go to a website like options profit calculator and you can figure out how much"
"2957400","2958620"," that that hedge costs."
"2959160","2965440"," You know if you're day trading or trading weeklies that you put your hedging on every day."
"2965440","2971620"," You throw on, so like let's say you took a weekly call on the spy for 480 tag on Friday. "
"2972900","2976300"," And you're like, I want to wait for a bounce on 474 captain."
"2976840","2978000"," We're just going up from here."
"2978240","2978820"," We're in trend mode. "
"2978980","2979720"," I agree with all that."
"2980140","2985040"," So then I would just say to you, okay, so then you just buy yourself a $0.02 spy put"
"2985040","2985740"," for today."
"2986080","2990360"," Then you go at the end of the day today and you buy another $0.02 spy put. "
"2990620","2992980"," So if we keep going up today, let's say we go up today to 478."
"2993820","2996420"," So we close the day with a squeeze up in a close."
"2997060","3002200"," So you burn down two cents and it costs you two cents to have some protection. "
"3003700","3006360"," We end up moving up into the close at 478."
"3006600","3007180"," What do you do with the close?"
"3007420","3008740"," You're going to buy another two cent."
"3010440","3016980"," Putting heading into the close for Wednesday expiry at 465 or whatever, whatever that that number"
"3016980","3018240"," is depending on where we close that. "
"3018980","3020740"," So just think about that stuff."
"3020740","3028700"," As we've trade forward, okay, you can certainly take this risk on, but you have to, you have to"
"3028700","3031020"," protect yourself up here when we're doing this."
"3031540","3036500"," Because all you need is someone that, you know, in these situations where we are right now, let's"
"3036500","3038740"," say a news story broke that we don't expect. "
"3039540","3042920"," Well, when something tragic happens or some we don't know, right?"
"3043420","3045840"," At any point while you're trading, you have to take risk on."
"3045960","3051240"," But at the same time, when we're at these levels, oftentimes you'll find a news story that breaks"
"3051240","3052920"," that we don't know or we're not expecting."
"3053920","3056940"," And it's used as an excuse to sell down. "
"3058560","3060500"," You guys that are all traders know this too."
"3060560","3065600"," You guys know that it's at these moments where you can take a lopsided short trade."
"3066280","3072020"," You can buy two cent puts that are a week, two weeks out, and they'll have a high chance of"
"3072020","3072200"," printing. "
"3077040","3077380"," Yep."
"3077380","3078600"," 45 baby."
"3079980","3081100"," Apple's breaking through. "
"3081240","3082040"," Let's look at Apple again."
"3084380","3084820"," Yep."
"3084900","3088060"," Apple is the moment we break through this stuff, you're going to see us hit. "
"3088200","3095620"," If we hit 478 today and we print those stupid calls, those penny calls, then that's some crazy shit"
"3095620","3096020"," right there."
"3101660","3106580"," If we print those 478 season, I'm going to smack myself in the head."
"3106840","3111040"," And it's crazy too, because the 477s are now worth 13 cents. "
"3113720","3115680"," So there's more interest for sure."
"3117840","3119300"," And this stuff does happen."
"3119720","3121760"," I can't tell you that it doesn't happen because it does. "
"3122480","3126900"," You will see sometimes trades like this."
"3127040","3128600"," We traded this stuff last week too."
"3128980","3133480"," I think we've had two or three trades at this point that have printed thousands of percent. "
"3137110","3139430"," And you know, those four, look at those four seventies."
"3140090","3140570"," Stupid."
"3140570","3143890"," For today, five dollars and 72 cents. "
"3144190","3144530"," It's insane."
"3148970","3154510"," Now, the moment you break through this kind of stuff here on Apple, it's off to the races."
"3155670","3157070"," Same thing is going on with Tesla. "
"3157910","3162010"," Tesla just keeps grinding, trying to break through at 1114."
"3162890","3165750"," And the moment you break through 1120, it opens the door to 1150."
"3166710","3169030"," All this stuff up here points towards us going higher. "
"3171700","3175320"," You see Spy ripping higher now, 475, 67."
"3175320","3177740"," It's clear skies on Spy right where we are guys."
"3178380","3179640"," You guys can see that, right?"
"3180320","3182060"," We are just wrecking sellers in here. "
"3183760","3184940"," Straight wrecking sellers."
"3191350","3199880"," Let me take a look at a look here because it's getting juicy."
"3204420","3206660"," And they're just getting that straight melt up into clothes. "
"3213450","3219350"," I can't wait to see these options because they're not four cents, but it'll just be a flip up to"
"3219350","3220250"," five cents now."
"3220250","3221050"," They were two cents."
"3222230","3223670"," 478 is now five cents. "
"3225770","3230730"," You start taking a two cent call and you make it turn into a 20 cent call, turn it into"
"3230730","3233090"," a 20 cent call."
"3235800","3237120"," That's a thousand percent."
"3238100","3238580"," It's ridiculous. "
"3262080","3263020"," And we're getting there."
"3265720","3266200"," 478."
"3266540","3268000"," Yeah, no, no, no worth five cents. "
"3268400","3269020"," Four and five cents."
"3270520","3272700"," That's the second trade of today with a hundred percent on it already."
"3275450","3276570"," Not financial advice. "
"3277650","3279230"," Don't follow anything I tell you to do."
"3287530","3288730"," Trade at your own risk."
"3297650","3298970"," Twenty eight hundred percent. "
"3303650","3304890"," This is just ridiculous."
"3306650","3307730"," A very ridiculous."
"3315890","3316810"," Very ridiculous. "
"3317070","3317590"," This right now."
"3319700","3320140"," Look at that."
"3320260","3321760"," We're at 47573. "
"3323280","3324240"," You break through."
"3324520","3325620"," You break through up here."
"3326100","3326560"," 477. "
"3327400","3328160"," You see what how or."
"3328660","3330740"," Yeah, we break through a 476 up here."
"3331340","3332700"," Keep your eyes on those calls. "
"3332700","3333880"," Because they're just going to."
"3334200","3335040"," They're going to flip."
"3335240","3336500"," They'll probably flip to. "
"3338220","3345020"," If you, if you don't bang, if you don't bash off 476 here, you'll probably see these calls move."
"3345460","3347180"," You'll see those 478s."
"3347800","3348900"," Hit a 10 cents. "
"3349080","3350160"," No problem if we break above."
"3351260","3351780"," 476."
"3352540","3353840"," They'll probably, yeah, they'll probably hit. "
"3355180","3357860"," Maybe eight or eight cents or so."
"3359780","3360760"," Seven eight cents."
"3361060","3362660"," And then if you break through and hold above. "
"3363220","3364760"," Go to 10 cents plus."
"3365120","3367120"," That'll be a 500% play."
"3375310","3376970"," You had that financial advice link. "
"3379910","3381850"," Let's make those four seven eights and do a sailboat."
"3382070","3382350"," No kidding."
"3386420","3387280"," But a good day. "
"3387860","3388340"," I'm happy."
"3388560","3389440"," It made some really good money."
"3389980","3390320"," I made some. "
"3390640","3392720"," I just took profit on a bunch of."
"3392920","3394740"," I had a whole ton of calls out there."
"3394740","3395700"," Both loads. "
"3396240","3399940"," And I've been trimming those positions the past two weeks."
"3400800","3401100"," And."
"3402700","3407500"," I bought the bottom of the last dip that we had the last major dip. "
"3407800","3410740"," And I just kept loading and loading and loading and loading and loading."
"3411280","3414620"," And I had like baskets of IWM baskets of spy."
"3415560","3418020"," So I'm just waiting for my next trade. "
"3422130","3423930"," Yeah, it's a great time to buy a hedge."
"3424490","3426430"," That's I want to buy a hedge."
"3426430","3428650"," So I'm back to what add. "
"3429190","3434030"," I had a hedge this morning that I had to sell for a loss, but it didn't make a difference."
"3435170","3436910"," And I'm trying to add another hedge."
"3437550","3441950"," I really want to buy something between this four 75 and 483. "
"3443910","3444690"," For March."
"3446310","3448870"," So just like JPM wants to do this week."
"3449710","3450770"," I'll add mine on as well. "
"3451990","3453730"," How you what you want to do is you go to the."
"3454450","3455890"," See if I can find the site here."
"3462340","3471450"," That's on my other computer, but you can go to the CBOE. "
"3472610","3476990"," And what you can do is you can check the put call."
"3478210","3478470"," Interest."
"3480030","3480990"," On SPX. "
"3481670","3484510"," I think that JPM does it on XP SPX."
"3484830","3486130"," I think that's where they put their collar."
"3486670","3489170"," And you'll see a spike on. "
"3489930","3491550"," Weird and weird strikes."
"3491990","3494290"," It won't be something like it won't be like a 430."
"3495230","3502570"," It'll be like a 437.5. And then a high a high strike at like four. "
"3503190","3504230"," You might be like five."
"3504750","3508930"," Maybe like some wacky like 523.5 or something stupid."
"3509730","3513870"," And you want to see interest in the thousands. "
"3514270","3516310"," It'll be a it'll be a weird spike too."
"3516310","3521250"," It won't fit the bell curve of calls and puts."
"3522950","3524830"," Put in call while on SPX. "
"3525430","3527350"," It's going to be a weird looking trade and prop."
"3527710","3529110"," I don't know if they put it on now."
"3529510","3535290"," I check every day right now and I haven't seen it come on supposedly the word of the street is"
"3535290","3536770"," that that collar comes on. "
"3537830","3541290"," Comes into the market early Monday or early Friday morning."
"3543600","3544940"," So maybe we'll see it then."
"3547260","3552220"," But I'll be looking as well to putting putting a hedge on the market or the net or for the"
"3552220","3552880"," next three months. "
"3553480","3557140"," I was I was hyping up the March 31st."
"3558460","3561960"," Dates on on those call and putting on putting your own putting your own hedge on."
"3562360","3565860"," But I think you should take the 18th expiry. "
"3566760","3572680"," So that you can so that you'll get a print right before."
"3572680","3577380"," I think you know what you'll do is you'll get the print on the 18th."
"3577740","3584740"," And then we'll rocket hire into the 31st like the Thursday before that Opex will crank will moon"
"3584740","3585220"," shot it. "
"3585320","3589200"," So you'll you'll unhitch your your hedge."
"3590000","3593560"," Just before that Opex and then you'll be asking me."
"3593780","3596720"," Hey, we take it along on Thursday before quarterly Opex. "
"3596860","3599700"," I'll of course say yes and we'll go blast into the moon again."
"3599700","3606260"," And you know, you have to also consider how much hedge you're putting on."
"3606640","3608380"," Think about what you've been making for money. "
"3608540","3609640"," Think about what you have in your bank."
"3611060","3615560"," And just know that even if we go out and make sure it's if you're putting on a hedge into"
"3615560","3617960"," March, make sure that's a spread."
"3618340","3619340"," It's put spread. "
"3621180","3627700"," And the more in the money it is, the more chance of it is of it printing into March 18."
"3627700","3632380"," So you're going to make more, of course, if you're going to throw some risk on and you're like,"
"3632380","3637940"," hey, I'm going to put it down at 460 or 450 or 430 or whatever your thesis is on whether"
"3637940","3638580"," market goes."
"3639120","3645560"," But there's no shame in just putting a 475 480 P hedge on the market for three months. "
"3645920","3649080"," Let's say we trade up and we're able to be bulls from now into March."
"3649700","3652020"," You just have it sitting there in the background."
"3652580","3654340"," Do not panic cell hedges. "
"3654400","3656340"," There's something that you just leave on."
"3656340","3662860"," No matter how high we go, just leave it on, because these banks come back and revisit these things."
"3663380","3670720"," These banks when they put these things on, what they end up doing is they end up to extend limiting"
"3670720","3676840"," where the market can go up and almost forcing the market back down to make them print. "
"3676840","3678880"," Not always."
"3679220","3680660"," They can lose their hedging."
"3681160","3683620"," It's not that they can't lose their profit on it either. "
"3683800","3689960"," It's just that it tends to, it tends to control the market where the market's going to go."
"3690640","3693120"," It has the propensity to do that."
"3693320","3695740"," So just consider that. "
"3696680","3698960"," And you really want to see where they're selling calls to."
"3699140","3703680"," You want to see where JPM sells calls because that's going to be your call."
"3703680","3707800"," Well, mostly other banks are looking for that same call as well. "
"3708180","3709180"," It doesn't mean it doesn't move."
"3709340","3713280"," It just means it gives you your plan for the next quarter."
"3714180","3715860"," And we'll do this every quarter together. "
"3722160","3723120"," Okay, so no worries."
"3723880","3727400"," So a caller trade is like this."
"3727600","3728860"," Okay, I'm a big bank. "
"3729880","3737600"," I'm a bank of Captain Jim James and we are ending a quarter right now."
"3737600","3741420"," So do I know what's going to happen in the markets next year?"
"3741740","3741800"," No."
"3742320","3744040"," Do I know it's going to happen in the summer?"
"3744240","3744420"," Nope. "
"3744660","3746200"," I know it's going to happen in the winter or the fall."
"3746420","3747060"," Nope have no idea."
"3747400","3749880"," Anyone that tells you that they know what's going to happen is a liar. "
"3752680","3756040"," Because one, because you don't know what unknown news is."
"3756560","3758900"," Let's say the president got sick."
"3759440","3760560"," You've got midterm elections. "
"3760880","3762220"," You don't know how those are going to turn out."
"3762220","3766420"," You don't know if we get a new variant of COVID that's actually really bad."
"3766660","3768800"," That's going to kill everybody that it encounters. "
"3769600","3773700"," You know, back in 1918, you should look back at the influenza epidemic."
"3775040","3782640"," And their year three was the worst part of their of their of their endemic of their other influenza"
"3782640","3783100"," endemic."
"3783580","3789780"," So the first three years weren't so bad, but a new variants of influenza came out and killed most"
"3789780","3791880"," of the world in its third year. "
"3791880","3793940"," So we don't know if that happens this year."
"3794320","3800780"," We don't know if the Fed decides to speed up tapering and then they hit us with a third rate"
"3800780","3801080"," increase."
"3801180","3802960"," That's not priced in the market right now. "
"3803480","3808560"," Although they say some people argue that it is, but so there's a lot of unknown stuff that we have"
"3808560","3810360"," no idea about in 2022."
"3811060","3817380"," So if you're a bank, if you're like Bank of Jim James, how do you trade the market?"
"3817380","3824280"," So how do you and especially like a JPM, they're they have two long only hedge funds."
"3824840","3827700"," So they have two arms of their bank that trade long. "
"3829180","3830820"," So we're at 475."
"3831520","3835080"," We know the market in real money is at 475 today."
"3835660","3839860"," And maybe we have an expectation that we trade between now and Friday to"
"3839860","3847020"," 485, right?"
"3847020","3852300"," So that I can do what I can take profit on my lungs from last quarter. "
"3852800","3857920"," Let's say I went long in Amazon and Tesla and I went long in Apple."
"3859900","3863240"," So I know that I'm going to cut my losers by the 31st."
"3863320","3866560"," So if I have any losing stocks, I'm going to cut those in the 31st. "
"3866880","3872580"," I'm also going to pump up the stocks that I want to take profit on from this quarter."
"3872580","3877880"," So let's say I'm going to take profit on Apple and whatever I'm wrapped up in the spy, whatever."
"3879520","3884700"," And then when I'm looking for the next three months for the news that we know, we know we just"
"3884700","3885500"," had our FOMC. "
"3885680","3887520"," We've been given guidance for the next three months."
"3889340","3891860"," So what I'm going to do is this, I'm going to put on a collar."
"3893260","3897380"," So I'm going to buy cheap puts, right?"
"3897880","3898520"," So a collar ready. "
"3899080","3901980"," I'm going to buy cheap puts and where am I going to buy them at?"
"3903240","3908780"," So I'm going to be looking for what we know about, I'm going to take a look right now and"
"3908780","3909860"," find out for you what it is."
"3910080","3912480"," I'm going to tell you guys what it is currently so you know."
"3915000","3919200"," So I'm going to look at what our implied volatility is. "
"3920840","3927520"," For the next three months, what the projections are, I can tell you right now what it is."
"3930420","3938440"," So the implied move for the next three months for the drum roll is a move to 500 or a"
"3938440","3939200"," move to 450."
"3942880","3945700"," So that's pretty basic, right?"
"3946300","3951160"," So if you're a trader or an investor, think about that right now. "
"3951400","3958220"," So we're at 475, the implied move is that we go to 500 by March where we go down to"
"3958220","3959540"," 450 by March."
"3960320","3963180"," And so how do you protect yourself if you're JPM?"
"3963600","3965760"," Well, we're pretty high right now, right, 475."
"3966480","3968360"," Maybe we make it to 480, 485. "
"3968880","3969540"," So what do I do?"
"3969680","3973040"," I'm going to sell some calls that are safe to sell."
"3974500","3979180"," Probably probably end up selling like 525s, maybe 550s."
"3980040","3981520"," I'll wait and see what they do on Friday. "
"3981760","3985900"," But let's say just right now, I'm going to be looking for us to go to 480."
"3985900","3992160"," And then I'll buy, I'll sell some cheap calls on the spy at 525, 550."
"3993060","3996900"," And then I'll buy some puts down at 450, right?"
"3997020","3998380"," Or 425, maybe?"
"3998680","4001240"," Excuse me, not 450 or 425. "
"4002340","4003320"," Nice low dirt cheap."
"4004440","4006020"," Let's look right now and see what?"
"4006500","4009440"," Spy, just for where we're at right now."
"4010120","4013200"," Let's look at some spy March 20. "
"4016310","4019670"," It's a March 18th."
"4019670","4022610"," And I said 425 or 450, right?"
"4022730","4024470"," 425 is real far outside the money."
"4026790","4036130"," 425s are $4.97. And 440s, there's interest in right now. "
"4036250","4037730"," So somebody's already done their own collar."
"4043270","4047710"," Somebody's already put a collar on spy 440 P."
"4049010","4053470"," Now some else put a collar on 445 P for the 18th of March."
"4053470","4056450"," I haven't looked at the 30th yet, 31st or whatever. "
"4057230","4059110"," And there's a little bit of a collar on 450."
"4060150","4061650"," Not big, but there's some there."
"4062450","4063610"," Let's look at the 30th. "
"4063850","4065350"," So some people are already placing these bets."
"4066350","4067770"," It's already happening in the market."
"4069050","4072710"," So March 31st, right?"
"4073470","4074130"," What are the banks doing?"
"4074630","4075690"," I always say that to you guys. "
"4075850","4077130"," What are the banks doing?"
"4077130","4078150"," I don't want to know what the banks are doing."
"4080840","4083460"," There's not much on the 31st, and I wouldn't expect it."
"4083880","4087740"," My expectation would be that it's going to be for the 18th. "
"4087880","4092780"," There's some collaring on the 31st, but I don't think you want to be looking for that to print."
"4092960","4094840"," I think you want to be looking for the 18th to print."
"4096979","4101720"," Maybe they add some more strike, some more dates, more OPEC states. "
"4103120","4104620"," No, those are all out, right?"
"4104979","4105760"," I think that's every week."
"4106439","4107500"," Let's look at March and March calendar."
"4107500","4112620"," Yeah, so they'll add more strikes, but you're looking for the 18th, I think. "
"4114750","4122100"," Next expectation is you're looking for the 18th, and you're going to be looking for some weird"
"4122100","4126380"," looking dates to put your hedging on."
"4127120","4131779"," The more money money they are going to spread, the more likely they are they're going to print."
"4132979","4137660"," But let's say you're looking for, let's say we're at 450 in March. "
"4138319","4139840"," How would your accounts hold up to that?"
"4139840","4144600"," If you're a long investor, or you're a long trader and we're at 475."
"4146020","4152340"," Let's say you're buying this buying right now and we wind up at 450 or 425 once March comes."
"4153120","4154819"," Do you have protection for that event?"
"4156380","4161120"," If you're a bear, no, anyways, what's the impact of this?"
"4161380","4164939"," What ultimately what does that mean when all these hedges are being made?"
"4166080","4170240"," Is it starts to form a put wall, right?"
"4170420","4174479"," You have heavy, heavy, heavy, heavy puts down at 450, let's say. "
"4175520","4177580"," And then you have heavy, heavy, heavy calls."
"4178720","4180040"," What did I give for the number?"
"4181840","4187580"," You'll probably have heavy calls at 500."
"4187580","4197240"," And so that gives you, you start to form a trading plan for expectations for the next three months. "
"4197980","4203240"," So that when you're listening to some guy like me on YouTube, or some guy on Twitter saying, you"
"4203240","4206440"," know, I don't expect us to go to 500 at this point or expect us to come down."
"4206900","4210600"," And this is where my support levels are and where the resistance levels are."
"4211120","4212180"," Does that mean we can't go above 500?"
"4212560","4212640"," No. "
"4212640","4220660"," You just need positive news in the market to raise that call wall or put wall or lower that put"
"4220660","4220860"," wall."
"4221080","4225980"," So let's say, let's say we're trading where I'm telling you, hey, the expectation is we're only"
"4225980","4229800"," going to 500 for three months of 2020, 2022."
"4230320","4236280"," Yet you have all these bulls and we're up at 485 or 500 or close to 500. "
"4236280","4246170"," But all these bulls end up buying calls for tech for ER in February that'll push the call wall"
"4246170","4247090"," up much higher."
"4247850","4254310"," But in reality, what happens is JPM will sell down their positions and buy their, so let's say JPM"
"4254310","4259250"," will buy their positions so that they can go long, right, to 500."
"4259910","4265870"," And then they'll sell out of their positions as we head into OPEX to get the print on their put"
"4265870","4266230"," side. "
"4266230","4271270"," And so that the call, the set call selling, they don't lose money in the call selling, right?"
"4271470","4278130"," And then they actually sell out of their positions down to 450 or 425 so that they actually print"
"4278130","4280530"," the other side of their lungs, right?"
"4282130","4282990"," Does that make sense?"
"4284210","4285630"," So how do I do that, right?"
"4286050","4290190"," So this is, let me get, let me get some more granular level."
"4290190","4296550"," So let's say I'm JPM and we're at 45 on Friday."
"4297270","4298230"," What do I do?"
"4298730","4299730"," I sell calls at 450. "
"4300770","4305430"," I buy puts cheaply at 450, let's say."
"4306210","4311210"," And then if nothing happens in the markets immediately on the first or the third, I just start"
"4311210","4312110"," selling out of my lungs."
"4313350","4314170"," That's all I'm going to do. "
"4314250","4315050"," I'm going to sell out of my lungs."
"4315690","4317330"," I'm going to take us down, excuse me."
"4317830","4319170"," Y'all sell out of my lungs, right?"
"4320850","4325410"," And then we have ER season kicking in, so then I'm going to start going long again because I'm a"
"4325410","4326350"," long only hedge fund. "
"4326950","4331730"," I'm going to drive us up all after 500, close to it, but not at it, right?"
"4331850","4333470"," Let's call like 448 or something."
"4334330","4335090"," I'm a long hedge fund."
"4335510","4341050"," So then I'm going to start taking profit towards the end of the quarter and start selling out of my"
"4341050","4341490"," positions. "
"4341990","4346870"," And as I'm selling and because I'm such a force in the market, we're going to then trade down to"
"4346870","4348490"," that 450, right?"
"4348870","4352490"," And now I know that my 500 calls that I sold are never going to print."
"4353730","4356810"," I'm never going to lose my position in the markets."
"4357650","4361630"," And then I'm going to print my put side as we come into the OPEX. "
"4361630","4368330"," The moment that they collect their money on their put side, what does JPM do then?"
"4368950","4375550"," They go long again in the market and they'll buy down at the bottom again and then they'll repeat"
"4375550","4377210"," that process all over again."
"4377690","4379210"," Does that make sense to any of you out there?"
"4380750","4382510"," Now, does this always work out?"
"4383110","4385290"," No, it doesn't always work out."
"4386150","4389110"," Often there are better ways for JPM to put a collar on the market. "
"4389450","4394750"," There are more profitable ways and more guaranteed profitable ways for them to hedge the market."
"4395750","4397690"," There are more complex ways to do it."
"4398130","4401530"," But you as Davy Day trader out there, what do you care?"
"4402250","4404370"," Just do a simple hedge on the market for three months out. "
"4405110","4412390"," And then when you're trading, you're able to protect your longs, protect the investments that"
"4412390","4412850"," you're going to make."
"4413470","4416850"," And then you can trade vol in the spy."
"4417430","4418370"," You have to trade the VIX. "
"4418410","4422690"," You just trade the vol in the spy on your weeklies and your zero dates and one dates and three"
"4422690","4427470"," dates with your cheap puts and calls on both sides of the trade."
"4429350","4433470"," So if you're bearish right now, what do you do if you're bearish, right?"
"4434930","4436510"," You know we're out of resistance level."
"4436510","4441410"," Anywhere from here to 480, 43, you know, top end of our trading range. "
"4443030","4445570"," I've already given you guys the plays if you wanted to take it long."
"4446290","4450790"," If you guys want to take it short, you're going to start making your entries now, right?"
"4450990","4454450"," So if you're a bear, you do what I do as a bull on the opposite."
"4455610","4461510"," You start by buying put spreads, then you don't want to get more aggressive. "
"4461510","4467530"," When you get more aggressive with put spreads, you're going to switch from debits to directional"
"4467530","4472070"," credit bear spreads because you want that direction, right?"
"4472170","4474750"," You want the swing to already be swinging down."
"4475590","4478830"," And then, of course, let's say we get up to 485 at some point and you're going to make them"
"4478830","4480390"," in the money and far dated out."
"4480950","4488170"," And if we do trade up to 48 or 45, you already know, if we trade into that, that you"
"4488170","4491490"," can then switch to single data or zero data. "
"4491490","4497450"," And if we trade and weekly puts, they're just naked, not, well, they be naked calls, I guess, are"
"4497450","4501770"," actually buying puts that are dated for one, one day to one week out."
"4502570","4505010"," And so you play these swings on either side."
"4506650","4507510"," Does that make sense?"
"4509150","4510810"," You don't have to complicate this stuff. "
"4511210","4512330"," And you can complicate it."
"4512570","4513270"," I could sit here."
"4513270","4520390"," And so I one, I forget who it was, but someone asked me on Twitter what to explain this stuff"
"4520390","4522850"," one day last week, and I explained it. "
"4523130","4524830"," And, you know, I could barely understand it."
"4525290","4529330"," What I explained and neither could that person that that person on Twitter was on my regular"
"4529330","4529690"," handle."
"4530130","4531750"," I forgot who I explained it to. "
"4531930","4537670"," But, you know, most people can't understand the complications of this stuff."
"4537670","4542510"," So, if you go down the rabbit hole in this stuff, it can become overly complicated."
"4543190","4545170"," And I'm not here to complicate my training. "
"4545370","4549870"," I'm just here to, to win and make money."
"4554960","4557420"," So we'll look at, we'll look at Facebook real quick."
"4579440","4581840"," Switch over to Tesla real quick and take a look at Tesla. "
"4583160","4583960"," All consolidation."
"4585360","4587820"," I want you guys to key in on this right now real quick."
"4587940","4588400"," This is important. "
"4591770","4592710"," I'll be right back."
"4592930","4593710"," Let me just a second."
"4611070","4615750"," But you guys need to see that Tesla is about to squeeze or, you know, potential. "
"4616290","4619270"," It's gotten way more buyers than sellers right now in Tesla."
"4619610","4621690"," So I'm going to head over to Tesla and click on my own charts."
"4625180","4626260"," Tesla's looking real good. "
"4627200","4628740"," Real good right now in Tesla."
"4631920","4633160"," And I'm going to bring this."
"4634000","4634800"," See if I can. "
"4637240","4644260"," Yeah, you're, you're looking for some resistance at 11 20, but ultimately, you guys hear me say"
"4644260","4644660"," this, right?"
"4644800","4646660"," You guys, you guys tune into my live streams."
"4646720","4647380"," I know you do."
"4648100","4649600"," And you know they end up printing. "
"4650000","4653380"," We talked about the 1100 a couple days ago, two, three, trading days ago."
"4653740","4656780"," So 11 50 is the price target for Tesla."
"4659950","4662570"," We're really grinding through here on Apple as well. "
"4663090","4665050"," You can see aggressive sellers are coming in."
"4665090","4666570"," They don't want to see this squeeze."
"4667290","4670410"," And you can see that we have more buyers than sellers on Apple. "
"4670830","4673470"," So the markets getting aggressive at this point."
"4686020","4689100"," They're a very aggressive buyer in the market right now."
"4692490","4696650"," Very aggressive buyers on Facebook right now as well. "
"4697030","4700110"," Good shout out on Facebook, by the way, whoever shouted that out."
"4714290","4720410"," And you also have to remember that you've got all of these hedges coming up the market as we head"
"4720410","4721550"," into the 31st."
"4722170","4723490"," They're all going to expire. "
"4729370","4732590"," These are a lot of you've got liquidity providers."
"4735660","4737680"," They provide liquidity to the market."
"4737680","4739040"," There's only a handful of them. "
"4739140","4743020"," There's like five to 10 liquidity providers in the market."
"4744000","4747380"," And so sometimes they get screwed."
"4747740","4749100"," You'll see this in market crashes. "
"4750280","4754340"," This is why you'll see billionaires will go broke or bust."
"4755580","4759640"," But what they do with these guys do like the Carl icons that are out there."
"4760380","4763200"," Bill Ackman's they provide liquidity. "
"4764400","4769180"," To the market and they're it's requested by dealers."
"4769780","4773920"," Brokers market makers that whole group of people they need to get liquidity."
"4774640","4779480"," So they'll go to a guy like Carl icon and they'll say, Hey, we're down at 450 right now. "
"4780080","4786780"," And people are asking for further downside protection at 425 right."
"4787240","4790320"," So they'll provide liquidity for that to happen."
"4791480","4793820"," Now, do we trade down to 425?"
"4794620","4794800"," No. "
"4795480","4796760"," No, they don't want that."
"4796940","4805340"," They don't want us to trade down to 425 when they're providing so much risk by selling puts to"
"4805340","4806520"," these bears, right?"
"4807820","4812260"," They're betting on us actually going up, not going down."
"4812940","4815020"," And they'll do the same thing on the upside too. "
"4815640","4821740"," So let's say bulls are like mega bullish and they're like, Hey, we're going to 550 by March."
"4822400","4827460"," And there's demand for it and you want to provide that liquidity."
"4827780","4834720"," You'll go to one of those big really rich people and ask them to sell call sell outside the money"
"4834720","4838600"," calls on their on their deep positions on SPX by whatever. "
"4840020","4842300"," But they don't want that stuff to print."
"4842300","4844460"," They don't want to lose their market position."
"4844780","4845380"," They'll get paid. "
"4846020","4849580"," Now they're cashback instead of the security, of course, right?"
"4849660","4856820"," If they lose that trade, but at the same time, most of these liquidity providers are taking very"
"4856820","4862320"," low risk positions by offering them to us on both sides of the trade."
"4866140","4867920"," Yeah, Facebook, man, killing it."
"4868580","4870080"," And they're brought to break through right here. "
"4870180","4871020"," You can see the grind."
"4872400","4874680"," You can see what the price targets are, right?"
"4875000","4876300"," 360 and 380."
"4877040","4878160"," That's pretty substantial. "
"4878700","4881940"," It's a big move for for a single, a single ticker like Facebook."
"4882680","4886820"," And the Facebook is that we give you an exact pin that you're looking forward to tag."
"4887280","4888960"," You're looking to tag three. "
"4893170","4898610"," You're looking for a pin strike on Facebook for 359.06. Makes sense."
"4900650","4902350"," 359.06 or so."
"4903610","4906430"," And ultimately, I mean, think about that. "
"4906590","4913990"," If you hit 380 on Facebook, you'd probably see the spy at 485 by the close of Friday, if that's"
"4913990","4914630"," the ultimate plan."
"4935920","4937180"," Yeah, we're laughing at hutch."
"4938280","4938800"," Yep. "
"4939680","4942040"," I came back on because we're at that point right now."
"4946020","4947160"," Congratulations, John."
"4950090","4950410"," No worries. "
"4950730","4951170"," I know you guys."
"4951390","4952510"," I don't want you guys to lose money anymore."
"4952510","4953130"," I'm tired. "
"4953330","4953710"," I'm tired."
"4953890","4956090"," I keep hearing all this noise on Twitter."
"4958750","4962810"," All these, all these so-called traders, I think they're liars. "
"4963370","4967170"," They're usually the ones with like 100,000 followers, million followers."
"4968570","4974390"," Put these charts out there that show that we're either going to the moon or we're going to burn the"
"4974390","4975130"," market down."
"4975590","4979440"," I'm just tired of it. "
"4979600","4981520"," So, I'll show you guys how to make money."
"4982080","4982740"," Both sides of the trade."
"4982740","4984020"," I'll show you guys on both sides of it. "
"4984220","4984560"," Make money."
"4987440","4988720"," I'm glad that you're not."
"4988880","4990180"," You haven't blown your account up, John. "
"4990420","4990540"," Seriously."
"4997900","5001880"," Yeah, if you don't understand everything I'm saying, I'm making a video series right now."
"5002940","5004580"," And it's going to be real basic. "
"5004580","5011320"," We're just going to start at basic levels and I will teach you what I'm talking about."
"5014230","5016890"," And we'll make it more complex as the series goes on."
"5018190","5018850"," Just short videos. "
"5019930","5023770"," Once you're to a certain point, you can then I'll direct you towards."
"5025070","5026570"," Some better videos."
"5026570","5031110"," There are some real dry stuff out there that's put out by the options industry council. "
"5031690","5033650"," And they can take you down the rabbit holes."
"5034190","5034450"," The."
"5035550","5043290"," The CV E.O. also in the NASDAQ, the NASDAQ and the CV E.O. I think they as well"
"5043290","5044870"," have some great videos out there. "
"5044870","5049970"," If you guys prefer to be vol traders or if you prefer trading the spy."
"5050490","5056290"," This is why I trade the spy mostly is because it's the easiest, most liquid index out there."
"5056610","5060890"," It's easier for me to pick the spy over an individual ticker. "
"5063230","5065710"," That's why I didn't get wrecked in the fall."
"5065970","5070070"," So in this in this fall, I made most of my money in the year this past fall."
"5070550","5072030"," The fall was very good to me. "
"5075170","5081950"," Because I didn't I didn't that I sold my investments in single tickers by September, I think, and."
"5083450","5084610"," Stuck with the indexes."
"5086550","5087570"," And you should too. "
"5087750","5091290"," I mean, honestly, there's no reason for you to make trading complicated out there."
"5091390","5096710"," If you if you have complicated trading going on right now, it's a good time to step back reassess."
"5096710","5103170"," I always recommend that you learn the spy first or ES or SPX it SPX is a little slow. "
"5104750","5107830"," But spy or ES you can do futures or cash market."
"5108410","5113110"," Then start to learn how to trade the cues then learn how to trade trade IWM."
"5114450","5117670"," And then add in a couple single tickers that are traded frequently. "
"5118390","5124130"," If you're adding in like an apple or Tesla, these are traded heavily by hedge funds."
"5124130","5128930"," There are boiler rooms all over the country and the world that trade just trade those single"
"5128930","5129510"," tickers."
"5129910","5134530"," So you can learn the setups and the patterns in these stocks. "
"5137050","5140390"," And then you can just you can you can shift when you need to."
"5140510","5145510"," So if let's say spies trading sideways and you don't feel like putting on a boring trade."
"5145670","5148650"," If you're not going to feel don't feel like trading the wheel or you don't feel like trading"
"5148650","5150370"," condors or butterflies. "
"5150830","5153710"," You can shift over to a stock that's actually moving."
"5153710","5160430"," And over time you'll start to learn other tickers you learn how to trade AMD Amazon, Facebook, all"
"5160430","5161170"," those tickers."
"5161670","5167030"," If you want to get into some forays with stock investing every Saturday and Sunday I used to just"
"5167030","5167890"," post them on Twitter. "
"5168670","5172070"," Just I would just post basic charts for you to look be watching."
"5172950","5181070"," I know Joe donut out there created Captain Jim James ETF of all the stocks I've put out there I"
"5181070","5182790"," think Quinn was following them as well."
"5182790","5188670"," And but I'm doing videos now every Saturday and Sunday with you guys I skipped this week of course"
"5188670","5189950"," because of the holiday. "
"5190430","5197130"," But I did last week's in a video format and I'll keep adding those every single week so you'll"
"5197130","5197450"," build."
"5198230","5205630"," Let's say you want to trade a meme stock or a loved stock out there retail favorite stock."
"5206670","5212350"," You build a port or a chart portfolio of one to 300 stocks. "
"5214230","5221770"," And you chart them out and you set alerts on channel lines and support and resistance lines this"
"5221770","5227810"," works for bears to next week's video I think I am putting a bunch of bear trades on for the"
"5227810","5229770"," bears out there you got to stay tuned if you're a bear."
"5231750","5238970"," But these tickers will trigger if you build that database of one to 300 stocks every quarter and"
"5238970","5240330"," you're rolling it every quarter."
"5240910","5247730"," Then every week you'll see an alert come up in your email that says hey Captain AMD's trading"
"5247730","5250010"," really low right now it's in the 90s. "
"5250410","5252990"," And you know that never happens another great one to look at."
"5252990","5258190"," You know it's one of my favorite trades is if you guys on your own charts look up XLU."
"5259930","5265310"," XLU is a great I should bring that up more frequently but if you look at XLU and like a"
"5265310","5269460"," one year chart I think it is banged. "
"5270000","5275540"," It has followed a trend straight up and if you just bought like three or four times this year on"
"5275540","5277600"," XLU it printed every single time."
"5277600","5285540"," I posted the last XLU trade back in September I posted a trade I think oh no it might have"
"5285540","5286020"," been in June."
"5286820","5295200"," I think I missed the September XLU trade but I did take the June XLU trade and it printed. "
"5296080","5300580"," It printed straight for like a month and a half I think they traded a three month call on it"
"5300580","5306340"," and it printed in the money with a couple extra points within a month month and a half."
"5308600","5312220"," So you chart this stuff for over the course of a year."
"5312500","5317560"," Get into these habits when you're a trader and investor and I promise you this works I guarantee"
"5317560","5319240"," this I'm still here trading this day. "
"5319780","5324340"," I pay my bills I know that it works I know that it's a simple program."
"5329640","5333760"," Oh yeah oh so Joe Harper's here I just flipped back over."
"5336880","5339380"," Yeah there's there's easy ways to trade this market. "
"5339380","5343460"," Yeah I enjoy trading Tesla."
"5344440","5350520"," So I used to really like trading Apple and for a little bit there I had some real concern for"
"5350520","5357980"," Apple because they had switched over from being a growth company in my view."
"5359000","5365340"," The stock markets dumb and traders are dumb and investors are dumb in my view so the market reacts"
"5365340","5370800"," to stuff they shouldn't react to right so I didn't like that they weren't making new devices. "
"5370800","5371640"," Like a car."
"5372140","5375160"," I want I really wanted to see a car sooner than later."
"5375700","5381760"," That doesn't mean that doesn't happen, but they switch to a services company and the markets it's"
"5381760","5383620"," not a sexy thing to be a services company. "
"5383880","5388960"," It is when you're like square or block or whatever they call themselves or PayPal or whatever, but"
"5388960","5394820"," when you're Apple they're making all their profit right now off of services, which is highly"
"5394820","5395400"," profitable."
"5395400","5401820"," And it has helped Apple to increase and to continue to grow and they've come back in favor, but for"
"5401820","5403240"," a couple ER quarters."
"5403920","5410320"," They were very on shaky ground with that trade so I moved back to Tesla trading Tesla again. "
"5410900","5415260"," And so I'm back on that Tesla trade currently and I like I like the Apple trade right now again."
"5415680","5419080"," I'm back on liking the Apple trade I like the car trade and Apple too."
"5419820","5425420"," We're looking at the Tesla feed right now, and this is a good sign you see how all these sellers"
"5425420","5432320"," have been absorbed right in here, and you'll see that we're starting to kill the sellers above at"
"5432320","5436480"," 115 and 120 price target is 1150 on Tesla. "
"5438060","5439700"," Same thing's happening up here."
"5440320","5448560"," You're seeing that that live wire above the resistance on Apple right now is at 179 if you break"
"5448560","5452600"," through to see you guys know, and if you break through like 180 point 32."
"5453160","5461760"," We're going to rip to 190 same things happening here on Facebook. "
"5462320","5466580"," If we trade above 350 140 you will see 360."
"5470810","5474770"," And this trading plan works as a bull or a bear."
"5475350","5480130"," So you could trade this plan just being a bull and step away from the market if you're"
"5480130","5486090"," uncomfortable being a bear and you can reverse this trading plan as a bear as well and it works out"
"5486090","5486650"," very well. "
"5488110","5495790"," And trading like this what it does is it removes the need to follow things like."
"5497110","5503710"," Like Elliott wave I have no fence on Elliott wave guys but it's not accurate enough when you're"
"5503710","5506730"," when you're when you're an investor in a trader it's it's too."
"5510490","5513730"," It doesn't so it doesn't so in theory. "
"5514550","5518510"," Things like Elliott wave or traditional stock truck stock patterns."
"5519150","5526390"," It seems like the work but on the on the tails of the of the ups and downs you end"
"5526390","5527050"," up getting wrecked."
"5527590","5535910"," So instead a trade using volume profile market profile I add that on to volatility or volatility"
"5535910","5537970"," trading right gamma trading. "
"5538950","5543250"," So vault so you got market profiles that you've got the volatility aspect."
"5543830","5549390"," Then you've got the gamma aspect and then I add in traditional trading and then believe it or not I"
"5549390","5554230"," do look at what the Elliott wave guys put out there because even if it's not accurate."
"5556310","5563530"," People trade based on indicators like RSI even though they don't work but they will trade based on"
"5563530","5565410"," those they'll trade based on Elliott wave. "
"5565410","5568970"," So there's some expectation that will trade to those numbers."
"5569910","5574230"," And then so when you're adding all that stuff together then you're looking at the indicators the 20"
"5574230","5577870"," day the 20s the 50s the 150s the 200s."
"5578730","5583530"," And then you put all that together and you try to get to the day that you're actually going to"
"5583530","5587730"," make some money and you open up book map and you see what the real money is. "
"5587730","5593650"," You see what the real price is you see where the real buyers are you see where the real sellers"
"5593650","5594110"," are."
"5594350","5598570"," And that's how you put your risk on that's how you say you know what I think we're going up"
"5598570","5601070"," today and it's proving itself that we're going up today."
"5601370","5607070"," I followed all these steps prior to they all match up to the 20 ma or the 7 ma it"
"5607070","5609630"," matches up to the Elliott wave guys what they're saying. "
"5609630","5611590"," So now how do I apply it."
"5611930","5617830"," So you need you need to be applying it exactly right you need to exactly time when you're entering"
"5617830","5620650"," you need to exactly apply when you're exiting."
"5621950","5623410"," You guys understand all this. "
"5627010","5632730"," Are there any books that I recommend for trading."
"5633430","5650980"," Yeah, you guys you guys like simple books I mean I don't know it's hard because it's hard"
"5650980","5652460"," becoming check one thing real quick."
"5662950","5665790"," It's just one second I got to check on a trade that I'm trying to make. "
"5693810","5703350"," So what books are you guys want to know what learning books do you recommend learning"
"5703350","5703830"," trading."
"5703830","5712950"," Yeah sure like option volatility and pricing dynamic hedging there's a whole bunch of them."
"5713390","5715090"," But those two right there. "
"5715910","5723110"," Their dense reads they they're like so so options volatility and pricing right let's talk about"
"5723110","5724010"," that book real quick."
"5724670","5728010"," The math is often wrong and there's a lot of problems with that book."
"5729630","5731370"," There's some issues in that book. "
"5732170","5734910"," I could go on and on about the problems I have with that book but."
"5736210","5744690"," The writer writes in the perspective of working out the theory behind trades that the banks put on"
"5744690","5749630"," hedge funds trades trade using that basic system."
"5750910","5754850"," So you want to be looking from their perspective and not a retail traders perspective. "
"5755870","5757730"," But the FIB levels are good."
"5758250","5764850"," Yeah, you know I use FIB levels I use it's so look it's not like FIB levels don't work because"
"5764850","5774470"," they do because we humans want to see patterns humans want to trade to certain levels."
"5774470","5779710"," So you will see movements in the market because of that. "
"5780190","5783710"," There's some other problems in the market though today you have."
"5786130","5786870"," Excuse me."
"5787650","5791530"," So I was talking about this the other night you there's some issues in the market. "
"5791830","5796270"," You have the Fed taking the foot off the pedal okay."
"5797510","5802610"," And meanwhile you have more retail traders than ever before in the market."
"5802610","5810230"," Then you have more information at the fingertips of retail. "
"5811430","5816070"," And then you have everyone trading the same stuff."
"5816550","5818030"," So everyone's trading spy."
"5818470","5819510"," Everyone's trading Tesla. "
"5820070","5820970"," Everyone's trading Apple."
"5821670","5826770"," You've got order flow coming out showing you where the banks are trading."
"5826770","5830450"," So every day when I come to you and I say hey look all this money is coming into spy"
"5830450","5832490"," points or all this money is coming into Apple calls. "
"5833030","5837370"," It's not just me and you didn't know that the banks know that the hedge funds know that everybody"
"5837370","5840530"," knows that right so now everyone's focuses on these stocks that"
"5840530","5856750"," are"
"5856750","5856750"," moving."
"5856750","5861590"," You got a guy like me Kevin out there on YouTube and he's telling you what he's investing in."
"5862030","5865230"," So then you get all this interest in these stocks over there you get Wall Street bets that are"
"5865230","5867270"," pumping stocks and dumping stocks. "
"5867590","5872630"," You've got Twitter right you start to see all these different social media things that are pumping"
"5872630","5873810"," stuff and dumping stuff."
"5874590","5879650"," And so you have to start to think about the Fed taking the foot off the gas as we go"
"5879650","5880390"," to 2022."
"5881140","5885650"," If you think about the information being relate relate around the market. "
"5886510","5892670"," And then think about the we have ETFs that trade on other ETFs."
"5892990","5898530"," So you've got like smaller ETFs that are trading based upon what's inside the spy or what's inside"
"5898530","5900150"," of IWM."
"5900150","5906690"," And you've got these you get these inverse ETFs right that are against the spy or against Kathy"
"5906690","5907890"," woods right. "
"5908230","5909610"," So you got to get all this stuff going on."
"5910930","5915270"," And everyone's making the same trades and when you get the Fed taking the foot of the foot off the"
"5915270","5915490"," gas."
"5916010","5921910"," You get what's taking place in the market the past couple months you can see it in September and"
"5921910","5925730"," November and December with these expanding megaphones. "
"5925730","5933370"," And you can start to see the volatility traders stepping in and they're playing the tails on the"
"5933370","5934670"," upside and on the downside."
"5935630","5938650"," So they're playing so you're seeing these wild swings in the market."
"5939010","5947750"," You're seeing us hitting targets that are like randomness in the market is becoming less random. "
"5947750","5953650"," You're starting to see us hit numbers that are we're not supposed to hit and that's because you've"
"5953650","5956650"," got everyone selling at the same time."
"5956730","5958690"," Everyone buying at the same time."
"5958930","5963870"," Everybody knows we're supposed to go to 480 483 or you'll start to hear people say we're going to"
"5963870","5967050"," 483 and the reason they're saying that is not because we're going to actually go to 483. "
"5967270","5969030"," It's because they're going to pull out at 480."
"5969590","5970930"," So they leave you with the bags."
"5971230","5971310"," Okay. "
"5972570","5979590"," So you have to consider this stuff and how dependent and enter almost like a snake eating its own"
"5979590","5979890"," tail."
"5980510","5985690"," And when you have the fed taking the foot off the gas, it's going to amplify as we trade into"
"5985690","5986230"," 2022."
"5987090","5990570"," It's going to get crazier as time moves for in my view. "
"5990770","5991530"," That's my theory."
"5992050","5995650"," That's what I'm positing for 2022 and beyond."
"6002540","6003180"," Yeah, exactly Rob. "
"6003340","6003860"," You got that right."
"6003860","6006180"," They work as long as a lot of people think they work."
"6006660","6012900"," And that's the one issue that I have with Feb levels and with Elliott wave is that they're only so"
"6012900","6013280"," good. "
"6013400","6014840"," You ever notice when we break through the 50."
"6015500","6021300"," We break through a little bit more or we break through the whatever we know is support and you say"
"6021300","6024380"," to yourself, man, I just lost that trade or I bought."
"6024700","6026740"," I didn't like I was going to buy the 50. "
"6027340","6028520"," So I bought the 50."
"6029140","6034620"," Then we swung lower and now my calls are wrecked and I won't even make it if we swing higher."
"6035420","6035520"," Right. "
"6035780","6037600"," So how do you solve that issue?"
"6038180","6039580"," And you solve that by."
"6040480","6044460"," You know, all that background work that you did, but then you're looking for the actual."
"6045680","6046480"," Order flow. "
"6047540","6052740"," And options flow and order flow on on shares live live during the day."
"6052900","6054440"," So you're looking for this stuff here."
"6057040","6064080"," You'll see sometimes when we haven't done it yet, but I hope to show you guys where supply. "
"6065200","6067340"," Let's say on the buy side, we can talk about it."
"6067680","6073360"," You can actually watch supply just disappear and you'll see a wave of sellers."
"6073980","6079340"," A waterfall almost of sellers coming in so that you can identify and say, does you ever notice when"
"6079340","6083020"," you're out there and you just trading on your own with candlesticks and you're like, man, that"
"6083020","6083540"," should have held. "
"6083540","6088080"," Or man, that was setting up for a with a bull wedge or a bear wedge."
"6088320","6089500"," Why did that fail?"
"6090620","6095840"," And is the or hey, is this going to fail right where we are right now or are we going"
"6095840","6096580"," to break through?"
"6096900","6102860"," And it's hard to know that information in a real trade unless you're watching the actual order"
"6102860","6103140"," flow."
"6103560","6108380"," And we talked also last night about always watching the opposite side of your trade. "
"6108380","6115680"," So if you're taking that 470 or that 478 trade, you're looking for before interest and IV kicks"
"6115680","6116600"," into an option."
"6117100","6120320"," You're looking for you'll see like a four sec like right now."
"6120340","6127240"," You'll probably you can watch the 460 or a 470, but let's say you could you watch the one that's"
"6127240","6128520"," like a week away from right now. "
"6129240","6133180"," And you'll see it hold some value at some point on the low end."
"6133200","6136400"," You'll see it like let's say it bottoms out at 20 cents."
"6136400","6141960"," But then you'll see it stick on 20 for a few days and then you'll see it start to creep"
"6141960","6144660"," up in value, even if the market's going up. "
"6146020","6149580"," So, and then we talked about this on the opposite side of this trade and the bull side of this"
"6149580","6152340"," trade, but you'll also see that on the bear side of the trade."
"6152780","6157660"," And you can't make money on the bear side unless you're buying those cheap cheap puts."
"6159140","6164060"," You don't want to be winning one to one on puts you want to be winning 500% 1000%"
"6164060","6168440"," 30 3000% and it's more difficult the time on the bear side. "
"6168740","6172840"," But you are wanting to always watch the opposite side of your trade because before the interest"
"6172840","6178560"," hits those puts or calls, they will grow increase in value and nobody's going to tell you that you"
"6178560","6180160"," have to do that leg work on your own."
"6184800","6193270"," About a few shares of each."
"6193270","6203160"," See this on Tesla sellers being absorbed same thing same"
"6203160","6204720"," story over here on Apple. "
"6205080","6209140"," I want you guys to remember this is sometimes a setup."
"6209520","6213220"," So I want you guys to think about this right now okay be hyper aware of this as we move"
"6213220","6213620"," forward."
"6215520","6217040"," Is that moment to pay attention. "
"6217040","6220160"," And that is that."
"6221260","6223540"," It's a one one 18 in the afternoon."
"6225980","6228180"," So I say this often my streams I'll tell you. "
"6228880","6235180"," The boys go to lunch around now right anywhere from 11 30 to one to door excuse me till three"
"6235180","6238260"," o'clock you guys know we'll find some weakness in the market."
"6240080","6243180"," You could be trapping bulls right now then we sell down."
"6243180","6248060"," You guys all get trapped and then you have to double down triple down to take this higher to 480. "
"6249640","6252200"," So I want you to be conscious of that as we move forward."
"6252760","6255760"," If we don't break through it this time now every once in a great while."
"6256460","6262980"," Everyone's away at lunch and the bulls or the bears will move it much higher much lower so you can"
"6262980","6264260"," sometimes get the opposite effect. "
"6264680","6269520"," We'll hit like 475 while you're not paying attention you're waiting to get back in at 330."
"6270240","6274800"," But generally speaking as a rule like 70% of the time 80% of the time you'll see some"
"6274800","6275600"," weakness come in."
"6275960","6277400"," This is where you get a bull trap. "
"6277880","6282280"," It's not really a bull trap that turns into we sell off but it is a bull trap where let's"
"6282280","6285280"," say we sell down to 47 35."
"6287660","6291360"," And then we start to consolidate for the next leg up to 478."
"6291980","6295560"," So you'll be like oh I just bought it at the top and now they want me to have to. "
"6295920","6301680"," This is where you'll find bulls start to add to their positions when they're upside down."
"6308120","6310280"," That's right that's what we do we front run the front rotters."
"6314970","6316070"," That's typically what we do. "
"6316950","6324930"," And that's what you should be doing right now."
"6324930","6326830"," It's not right now in my view."
"6327230","6328650"," I don't see the bear trade yet. "
"6329350","6339130"," But I am I've got my eyes on puts today puts for the third is a key"
"6339130","6344720"," one for me that I'm looking for the 29 31st the third."
"6345660","6352800"," I really like the idea of the four sixties they're down at 36 cents 35 cents."
"6353440","6354520"," I'd like to see them there. "
"6354600","6355280"," I think they were down it."
"6355720","6358420"," I think that weren't they down to like 20 cents at the start today."
"6359840","6360780"," Maybe they weren't. "
"6361040","6362340"," I might be misspeaking here."
"6362980","6364860"," But they're they're pretty much holding value here."
"6364980","6367400"," You can see them at 36 cents 35 cents. "
"6367760","6369520"," They haven't lost any value at this point."
"6370460","6373400"," They have bottomed so much for at this point at the day."
"6374160","6376380"," So I'm going to keep my eyes on those as we move forward. "
"6378980","6380540"," And now 35 cents."
"6380960","6385600"," But if I can get those like if I can get those for 60 P's for like 20 cents."
"6387100","6394580"," At any point this week or I can get the four seventies for next week down to like 60 cents"
"6394580","6396400"," or even 30 cents believe it or not. "
"6396980","6400480"," I can take that trade at some point and head into next week."
"6402120","6403300"," I'll put that trade on."
"6405140","6407920"," But keep your even if you're not trading them keep your eyes on them. "
"6408800","6411200"," Because what you'll see is you'll see us move up to."
"6412320","6413160"," You'll see us."
"6413320","6415560"," Let's say and you already get rice targets up here. "
"6416100","6417980"," You can see it's 1150 on Tesla."
"6418040","6418400"," Right."
"6418800","6420920"," So where are you going to go heavy on puts is up in here. "
"6420920","6421720"," If we get up here."
"6422320","6426460"," We get like you get put put put spreads on up here on the spy against Tesla."
"6427200","6431880"," At 1120 and you'll get real aggressive on on puts above here at 1150. "
"6432580","6433960"," I'll turn full bear."
"6435260","6436380"," The timing is critical."
"6442880","6444180"," Some sellers and buyers here. "
"6445740","6448160"," So we can go a little bit more granular here and see what's happening."
"6450460","6452480"," Guys can see this happening in real time."
"6453820","6455680"," We're breaking through above here. "
"6456260","6458880"," You want to see at some point see how we reject right here."
"6459440","6462460"," You want to see us break through right here instead of this rejection."
"6462860","6465180"," You're looking for us to jump above. "
"6465760","6467900"," And the moment we jump above this area here."
"6468440","6470220"," We wear these people out right here."
"6470540","6471960"," See this see all this right here. "
"6473580","6477160"," If we wear this out, you'll see this drop off this big red mountain."
"6477280","6478500"," We'll just collapse."
"6479220","6481240"," And the moment you see that collapse will take a long. "
"6482540","6484520"," That's what I'm waiting for to go long again in the spy."
"6485560","6486760"," It's for this moment right here."
"6486960","6487840"," If this moment happens. "
"6488420","6492140"," If you see this moment happening, you know that we're going for 78 today."
"6503130","6503370"," Yeah."
"6507070","6507490"," Okay. "
"6507650","6508550"," Some questions here."
"6509130","6510930"," My laptop battery is going to die."

"6517270","6518690"," this coming week. "
"6518730","6520830"," I've got a new office that I'm building."
"6521510","6523250"," I've got some souped up internet."
"6524030","6529870"," I've got multiple computers that will be running live streams for you all day long. "
"6530390","6536410"," Eventually what you're going to get for me is you'll get your video every night and then you'll get"
"6536410","6539310"," the Twitter posts and then we'll just do live feeds."
"6541470","6545130"," We're all we're all turning the microphone on and off a key points in the day."
"6545490","6548730"," So if you guys pop in and out and say, Hey, what's happening right now at this moment. "
"6548950","6550350"," I'll be able to answer for you."
"6553490","6556830"," So Matt wants to know about 190 calls for interview year."
"6557330","6558670"," What do you look for again?"
"6558930","6559610"," So let me give you. "
"6560070","6562630"," So if I was going to take an Apple trade right now, I'm going to tell you exactly what I'm"
"6562630","6563050"," looking for."
"6566740","6570020"," Okay, so I would be looking for, let's say."
"6571220","6572900"," You want the 190 right. "
"6573360","6575020"," I would just take it in the money call."
"6576640","6579020"," That expires on the 31st."
"6582140","6585540"," And yeah, that's I just take the weekly at this point for 190. "
"6586120","6587540"," Do I think we get to 190?"
"6588560","6589000"," Maybe."
"6592240","6594100"," Maybe it's a it's a tough one."
"6594120","6595740"," So you take a closer to in the money. "
"6595820","6597420"," You let it ride from now."
"6598820","6599260"," Into."
"6600380","6601420"," I've no you know what I do. "
"6601600","6602540"," I would date the call."
"6604240","6607960"," For 190 matter of fact, I'll give you the exact call to exact what I buy."
"6608860","6610660"," Might as well just go through the process here. "
"6616710","6618270"," Let me give you what I want."
"6618430","6618690"," You ready?"
"6619370","6619770"," This is what I buy."
"6622610","6628970"," I will see that earnings right coming up between January 21st and January 28th. "
"6630090","6630530"," Right."
"6634520","6635820"," Let me just a second here."
"6651820","6654260"," Let me see what I'd be buying here. "
"6659650","6660130"," Okay."
"6661490","6664230"," You guys are not going to like me when I tell you this, but I'm going to tell you right"
"6664230","6664770"," now when I buy."
"6665350","6668950"," So if I would try, if I'm going to trade. "
"6670170","6671530"," The Apple ER."
"6673570","6675390"," I am going to buy."
"6677710","6679210"," January 14th, 180 C."
"6681330","6682330"," I'm going to hold. "
"6683150","6690110"," Them to 190 and the expectation that we hit 190 before the end of this year."
"6691960","6695580"," And I would cut them loose by the 31st."
"6696380","6698840"," Regardless if we hit 190 or not. "
"6699180","6703200"," And I'm going to expect Apple to have a Selva news event."
"6704260","6705360"," Before ER."
"6706880","6712100"," And it'll trap some of you that are that are going to ride calls into. "
"6713000","6713380"," ER."
"6714120","6715480"," That's my prediction, though."
"6715940","6721100"," So my rules would be 180 C dated for January 14th. "
"6722180","6727600"," Or and hold that call into 190 or just January 31st."
"6727920","6728640"," And then."
"6730340","6733620"," To protect the trade, I would take. "
"6736520","6738040"," A look."
"6742040","6743460"," To protect the trade."
"6761850","6763180"," What are we looking for?"
"6769930","6771390"," Anyone second here. "
"6777910","6779510"," January 28th."
"6791900","6794900"," Yeah, just to protect the trade, I'm back to that for 60."
"6796000","6797500"," Dated for the third. "
"6800280","6800900"," They're dirt cheap."
"6801860","6804940"," Throw a couple for 60 P's for spy."
"6806780","6809800"," You'll cut loose the Apple trade by Friday. "
"6810360","6813500"," And then stay in the for 60 P."
"6813500","6816900"," Let them expire worthless or print into Monday."
"6817820","6819000"," That would be my trade."
"6820100","6820740"," Apple. "
"6824450","6825130"," What was that question?"
"6825970","6827210"," So that was for Matt."
"6828930","6830130"," Will money bags."
"6833930","6836030"," Is unusual wheels worth the buck. "
"6836750","6838650"," So I can't."
"6839310","6841910"," Unusual wheels works for some people out there."
"6842650","6844010"," It didn't work for me. "
"6844010","6848150"," I like, I don't like to overload of information."
"6850110","6856270"," So my, the best, the best flow software I've ever used for me is, is a flow."
"6856470","6856690"," I'll go. "
"6866440","6867780"," And where are we at?"
"6868020","6870140"," On four 78s."
"6870740","6872080"," Are now worth five cents."
"6872660","6873680"," They were trading at two cents. "
"6893690","6894930"," And Tesla is now."
"6897210","6897770"," Cranking."
"6898590","6900190"," Tesla's going stupid high. "
"6903240","6904780"," Spies going stupid high."
"6905080","6908120"," Spy just pinged off 476 15."
"6913730","6915150"," Facebook's looking really juicy. "
"6915890","6917730"," I mean, they're paying 347 already, but."
"6920650","6923370"," Look at Facebook real quick and see what's going on."
"6923550","6925690"," Facebook's an interesting one to me right now at this moment. "
"6927050","6928830"," See what's happening here in Facebook."
"6933770","6934930"," Buyers at 345."
"6939050","6941750"," And they're, they're really trying to break above that 348. "
"6949690","6950710"," You see that right?"
"6950810","6951590"," We're talking about this."
"6951650","6953150"," We want to break above and hold this."
"6953870","6957150"," It's really what we're looking for here in the spy is that break above. "
"6961320","6964220"," And you see sellers coming in on the spy right now."
"6964280","6965320"," Be careful here."
"6965460","6966660"," We're at 130 in the afternoon. "
"6967800","6969020"," This could be the trap."
"6980820","6982640"," We're at a critical moment in the market for sure."
"6983740","6984180"," Okay. "
"6984300","6985960"," Let's look and see what the questions you have."
"6986840","6993300"," I know, I know that's like we buy an expensive calls on the four, the $4 apple calls."
"6994060","6995280"," Is that what you're pointing out?"
"6996260","6996660"," Matt. "
"6997000","6999980"," So the, yeah, I wouldn't trade the apple trade."
"7000300","7000940"," I wouldn't take personally."
"7000940","7002520"," I wouldn't take the apple trade. "
"7003420","7009040"," But if I were to take the apple trade right now based on that ER play, then I would only"
"7009040","7009880"," take it to 190."
"7010340","7011260"," And I think it would hit before."
"7011840","7014100"," I think, I think it would sell the news coming into. "
"7016450","7016930"," Yeah."
"7017010","7018330"," Trady tics is the same way."
"7018710","7022390"," Trady tics is, you know, there's so much information in Trady tics. "
"7023190","7024650"," In theory, it sounds great."
"7025790","7028750"," And you can switch on the move with Trady tics too."
"7029650","7032090"," And a lot of their stuff does print in Trady tics. "
"7032630","7037230"," What's, what I don't like about Trady tics is let's say they're like, okay, so pins has all this"
"7037230","7037590"," interest."
"7038270","7045770"," The hedge wall is coming off, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"7045770","7047890"," Loses attention on that trade. "
"7048510","7050230"," You end up burning it to the ground."
"7050670","7053250"," You're like, well, well, well, you guys come back and look at pins right now."
"7053550","7058530"," And meanwhile, the new shiny object is out there and you've set this trade up. "
"7059490","7062150"," And you've gotten, you've gotten deep involved in this trade."
"7062430","7066710"," So their trades sometimes take weeks, two weeks, three weeks to trade."
"7067090","7071150"," And then I look at something like flow, I'll go and they're like, boom, this morning. "
"7071390","7072090"," This is what's moving."
"7072090","7075950"," This is the new shiny object in the market right now."
"7077350","7079470"," And so that's the most current information. "
"7079910","7086630"," So I'm 10, I'm tending to a want more, more condensed information."
"7090550","7091470"," Yeah, that's the flow."
"7091890","7094710"," Yeah, that's, I use, I've used black box too. "
"7094850","7095170"," I've used."
"7095490","7098390"," So I've, I've, I've bought every single service out there."
"7098510","7102150"," I bought them all that one point or another used them all. "
"7102330","7102650"," You name it."
"7102650","7104290"," You name a service and I've used it."
"7104850","7108270"," And I've whittled it all down to the stuff that works for me. "
"7108530","7112990"," So now I, so by the stuff that I pay for, I pay for trade the news."
"7114410","7118110"," I pay for, that's about new squawk."
"7118210","7120130"," You can, you can buy new squawk or trade the news. "
"7121270","7123090"," They're, they're like 300 bucks a month."
"7123890","7125870"," And then I pay for flow, I'll go."
"7126450","7128230"," I pay for spot gamma. "
"7128230","7132890"," I pay for, I just dumped trading ticks finally."
"7133450","7135870"," They were the last one that I've been turned on to."
"7135970","7137490"," I dumped, I pay for book map. "
"7137990","7143930"," I pay for the, for the futures feed, the glove X feed, the multi feed with like three different,"
"7145630","7146890"," three different feeds."
"7147230","7151170"," And then I pay for the, the DX feed on the cash market and book map."
"7152510","7156750"," I use my volume profile and market profile with think or swim. "
"7156750","7160230"," And then I pay for trading view for all my research."
"7160890","7161990"," That's where I do my research."
"7162410","7165390"," I have a holdover where I use for candlesticks. "
"7165430","7166230"," I use weebel."
"7166810","7169710"," Their candlesticks are as fast as any feed out there."
"7170010","7170550"," It's free. "
"7170870","7171870"," It's a holdover for me."
"7172050","7174510"," I don't put any indicators on that, on that stuff."
"7174730","7179370"," I just chart out, I chart out my spy day trading on weebel. "
"7180250","7185850"," So I'm watching spy for my levels and book map for my levels."
"7185850","7189330"," And then I'm making my trades in tasty works."
"7190130","7198210"," I do some trading for really fast spreads on options.ai. Cause I need a quick visual and where the"
"7198210","7199230"," best prices are. "
"7200590","7203210"," So on options AI, I take some trades there."
"7203510","7206910"," It's a shitty platform for executing anything but spreads."
"7207550","7215430"," And even then that they have order flow issues or, or the, whoever they're selling their order flow"
"7215430","7217770"," or selling and buying order flow with. "
"7218170","7219810"," I think they're tied into Robinhood."
"7220410","7222110"," So your fills really suck there."
"7222830","7227250"," I always recommend to any of you out there for your traders and investors that you should pay for"
"7227250","7227630"," your trades. "
"7228150","7229270"," That's why I use tasty."
"7230410","7230890"," Tasty."
"7231890","7234750"," If there's a problem, they fix it every single time. "
"7235410","7236150"," You can go to ninja."
"7236510","7238350"," You can use whoever you want for your trades."
"7238350","7244470"," But I like to have, I like paying for my trades because they don't fuck with my order flow. "
"7244990","7246870"," They don't spoof the pricing."
"7247350","7254230"," You know, they're selling you the wrong price on like I get fills below bid and ask sometimes."
"7254530","7258810"," Oh, let's say the ask is a dollar and the bids 95 cents. "
"7259010","7263690"," I will get the 95 cents sometimes on tasty where I wouldn't."
"7264270","7270970"," On a broker that sells and or is selling and buying order flow."
"7274310","7275710"," There's a big moment on the spy. "
"7277070","7278450"," So I pay for my trades."
"7278810","7284080"," If I ever have a problem, let's see if we can."
"7286190","7288410"," Looks like it's happening right now on the spy, right?"
"7293760","7295460"," You see this rejection over here. "
"7295480","7296840"," You see this rejection right here."
"7297120","7299540"," You see these buyers stepping in right now, right?"
"7299720","7301760"," This is money flow entering the market right now."
"7302800","7306220"," You see how this is turning yellow and blue over here. "
"7306660","7307780"," What does this mean to you?"
"7307820","7309640"," This means that sellers are being absorbed."
"7310440","7312860"," We're at a critical moment where we're going to we're going to rip higher."
"7319060","7321620"," You want to be paying attention to this little area right here. "
"7322860","7327900"," In between where this with this white line is right here and this line is right here."
"7328440","7332360"," You can see before it happens what's going to happen in the market."
"7333060","7336580"," Sometimes you'll see a big red bar above and a big red bar below. "
"7337200","7342400"," Right now you're seeing this big red bar, but you're seeing this turn into this blue orange."
"7342860","7345540"," There's a big fight happening right now in the market on spy."
"7368700","7374440"," Yeah, TD, you guys you guys you guys learn over time that you'll like have holdovers. "
"7374440","7378720"," You'll try different services and some things will stay with you and some things won't."
"7378720","7380680"," Like I don't do anything on Tasty."
"7381180","7384180"," I don't I don't use any of their any of their platform. "
"7384580","7390800"," The only thing I use it for is I can quickly see where interest is in options chains."
"7390980","7396820"," I like that aspect of tasty like I can quickly look at where all the money is in the options"
"7396820","7397560"," chains."
"7399360","7402660"," And I can place my trades through them and their help desk is amazing. "
"7403200","7404840"," But other than that I don't use them for anything else."
"7405200","7407220"," I don't listen to the shows that they have on."
"7407220","7410300"," I don't follow any of the traders trades on tasty. "
"7410860","7412340"," I know some of you guys love tasty."
"7412400","7414040"," I don't I don't use them for any of that stuff."
"7417540","7425420"," You can see someone here just posted that that blood stunt places all his trades with TDA for that"
"7425420","7425640"," reason. "
"7426060","7430840"," Yeah, you guys mostly want to be using if you guys have the chance you should be making your trades"
"7430840","7431700"," with a bank."
"7432300","7434100"," Like the banks that offer trading."
"7434640","7436460"," They don't sell order flow. "
"7436820","7438380"," They are the order flow providers."
"7438380","7440240"," What are you know one of them."
"7441180","7447380"," They back so when so like when GME was trading it really high and you couldn't get you know you"
"7447380","7449780"," had the excuses coming out while we can't let you trade. "
"7452240","7458720"," GME right now that well the banks can the banks have the money to fund those trades liquidity to"
"7458720","7460060"," back those trades for you."
"7465580","7466780"," Am I swinging spy?"
"7467340","7468600"," That's a great question Joe."
"7469780","7476060"," Yeah, I swung spy I've been swinging spy for two weeks, but I am currently a straight cash at the"
"7476060","7476260"," moment. "
"7480420","7484480"," I'm either going to try to catch this breakout on the spy going up."
"7485460","7486940"," If we can get a breakout here."
"7487100","7489000"," This is a big moment for the spy right now. "
"7489740","7491260"," I'm looking for this breakout above."
"7491760","7500820"," Let's look at this a little bit closer and we what do we know right now we know that this"
"7500820","7502120"," is where the money is right."
"7502120","7506900"," This is where the money entered the trade down here at four seventy four. "
"7507720","7511720"," We know we're at this critical level right now four seventy five right."
"7512280","7513920"," We're looking above to what."
"7514980","7516660"," What's the trade to right now. "
"7517920","7520140"," Guys all know right so four seventy eight."
"7529080","7531740"," You can see it up here four seventy sevens fifty."
"7532700","7536200"," I know that you're here and talk out there about the trades to four eighty three. "
"7539050","7541470"," I see clear skies above from there."
"7541570","7542630"," I don't see that forty three."
"7543010","7545050"," I think you're going to hear people say it's at forty three. "
"7545350","7549730"," I think the real trade is probably right here four seventy eight."
"7551470","7557190"," Possibly we run before eighty, but my bet is that you take the trade to four seventy eight."
"7563410","7567010"," And this is where this trade started down here four seventy four. "
"7573500","7574760"," And we're looking for."
"7580950","7587110"," You see this this news news sellers are above here on the spy stepping and remember this was blue"
"7587110","7587630"," and yellow."
"7588170","7591790"," And now it's turning red again right you see down below here. "
"7592010","7597870"," You see some whites in a small band of red that means that the buyers are getting weaker and the"
"7597870","7599990"," sellers are getting stronger here at this level."
"7599990","7601990"," I see all that."
"7603070","7606590"," And you can see that it's proving itself down below on the bottom right hand side. "
"7606590","7612530"," You'll see that we had more buyers, but now we've got this we've got this massive massive south"
"7612530","7614090"," side coming in on the spy."
"7616100","7617520"," So you want to be wary of that."
"7622990","7626530"," And I'm going to I didn't put it up today, but I'm going to I need to put up the"
"7626530","7629450"," spoofing indicator for you guys. "
"7629450","7638930"," I think I wanted to put on what did I want to put on for you today."
"7643620","7644620"," Where is it at?"
"7646740","7648480"," Not the studies configuration."
"7653060","7654760"," Now you guys want to see VWAP. "
"7655900","7657560"," The VWAP on for you."
"7660520","7665500"," So you guys want to see like a visual presentation of VWAP."
"7666320","7668520"," You see the strike down below here right. "
"7669760","7675620"," You see this strike at 10 a.m. This is where VWAP right you see where the buyers are."
"7675980","7680900"," So this is even where this is even where the market lies to you."
"7681080","7684060"," You got VWAP traders saying why buy the VWAP right. "
"7685180","7690740"," And yet the VWAP is actually you probably have if we if we come back down you'll see the VWAP"
"7690740","7697680"," break to where the real money is at 473 unless you see a new red bar move up to this"
"7697680","7700000"," VWAP as time as time passes."
"7700000","7704560"," So I do I do try the VWAP with the heat map sometimes."
"7711250","7714530"," I should probably put this up every day for you guys so you know where VWAP is. "
"7716930","7720610"," But this this shows you that VWAP doesn't always hold either does it."
"7721250","7725950"," And you'll see that VWAP is higher than where it actually is really want to see a red bar sneak"
"7725950","7729290"," up in here if we do if we do fall here on the spot."
"7729550","7731310"," But I don't see us falling right now. "
"7731630","7735870"," I think we break through there's a lot of there's a lot of push to get up to the now."
"7736610","7742410"," We have four seventy seven fifty it looks like on the south side four seventy seven point forty"
"7742410","7742930"," seven."
"7743230","7747290"," That's what I'm going to expect to strike at a pin strike today. "
"7751400","7755560"," And you guys know I'm a buyer down here or wherever this red bar comes back into play."
"7756380","7760940"," You'll see there's a little bit up here for forty seven four eighty buyers waiting."
"7762200","7764100"," Smart money is down here at four. "
"7764100","7767260"," Four seventy two ninety three."
"7768420","7772940"," And then we know we've got the real sellers above at forty seven seven sixty."
"7778570","7780030"," We'll take this more granule. "
"7781210","7782210"," See that right there."
"7787860","7791540"," More buyers lining up for eighty up here for seventy eight fifty."
"7793770","7795810"," Go back and see what you guys are talking about here. "
"7798350","7800350"," Yeah and cues you guys want to see the cues."
"7801010","7802790"," Yeah, I've got the heroin decatur on ES."
"7803330","7804690"," The heroin decatur is dope. "
"7805870","7807370"," Let's look at the cues."
"7808450","7809650"," Bring that up for you guys."
"7819650","7821490"," And you guys want to see what's going on with the news. "
"7829060","7838870"," I love the heroin"
"7838870","7839410"," decatur."
"7847350","7850050"," I called it on pre-market on Twitter."
"7855520","7859320"," What's my success rate right now with my trade with you guys pretty good right. "
"7859900","7861140"," I know you guys know it's pretty good."
"7861140","7863460"," I don't know why the cues aren't coming up here."
"7863700","7864160"," I'm lagging. "
"7866430","7868150"," I'm getting very laggy right now."
"7870220","7871960"," Let me unsubscribe real quick."
"7887340","7887940"," There we go. "
"7888760","7889240"," Okay."
"7890840","7893620"," I'm running the center like this all day long live streaming."
"7893800","7894640"," It's just cranking. "
"7906780","7911680"," I'm probably going to get a phone call from Comcast saying can't do this every day."
"7913500","7915760"," Let's take a bring this down."
"7917710","7918990"," That's not really lagging. "
"7918990","7921510"," I wouldn't call this lagging on the cues at all."
"7922830","7924450"," It's just absorption of sellers."
"7925470","7926090"," We're at resistance. "
"7926610","7927770"," We know we're at resistance."
"7929190","7930450"," We know that right now."
"7930550","7932270"," We know we have to grind through sellers. "
"7932670","7934290"," We have more buyers than sellers."
"7936290","7938030"," You can see it right here."
"7938170","7940030"," We've got way more buyers than sellers on the cues. "
"7941010","7942290"," It's just a matter of breaking through."
"7942970","7945830"," You're going to be saying yourself, well, where are we going in the cues?"
"7945830","7946990"," We're going up."
"7947630","7950090"," This isn't a bearish. "
"7952190","7954030"," Nothing here looks bearish on the cues."
"7954890","7957010"," Your price target right now in the cues is 405."
"7964400","7966540"," Ultimately, you've got ice above at 410. "
"7968900","7972840"," In reality, you're going to break through here more than likely unless the buyers disappear."
"7973720","7975980"," This is real money flow, real order flow, real price."
"7976940","7978840"," It means more than any chart you have out there. "
"7978840","7982860"," You know that the real money or the smart money is down at 400."
"7983500","7986920"," If you're panicking, you don't want to enter right now, you don't have to."
"7987340","7994580"," You'd look for a break above 403.29 to take it to 405, possibly 410. "
"7995300","7999080"," If you want to not put as much risk on, I'd be looking to be a buyer at 400."
"7999960","8000920"," Hopefully, you get some weakness."
"8001340","8004440"," If you missed the trade, you missed the trade, you can look somewhere else for a trade. "
"8004440","8008800"," But let's say you aren't, you're not in the cues right now and you want to take a trade in"
"8008800","8009000"," the cues."
"8009360","8012760"," Just set an alert for 400."
"8015800","8019700"," 400.25. If you get a dip, I'd be buying it. "
"8019960","8022040"," I'd be looking to see if the buyers are still there."
"8022500","8024920"," If they are still there, then I'm going to buy that dip."
"8028720","8029980"," If you missed the trade, you missed the trade. "
"8033310","8034710"," We took this trade already."
"8036010","8038310"," And I've taken my profit."
"8038610","8042030"," You guys have to decide when you take profit or, you know, you cut your losses. "
"8043110","8044030"," Same thing for me."
"8044150","8048510"," I have to decide how long I'm staying in my trades, how long I'm going to hold them and when"
"8048510","8049550"," I'm going to rebuy back in."
"8050010","8053530"," Ultimately, you're always responsible for your own trades. "
"8054050","8056330"," You guys all know that out there in the real world, right?"
"8057130","8058110"," It's like the big boy pants."
"8073300","8075580"," Boy, they're really trying to pin this 478."
"8075860","8077240"," They don't want 478 printing. "
"8077960","8078900"," What are they going to do?"
"8079020","8079860"," Make it worth a dollar?"
"8081260","8082720"," Right at the close or something?"
"8083180","8084560"," That pisses me off seeing that."
"8093630","8096070"," It was good for like 100% trade, but nothing more."
"8097670","8102570"," I left my ass off if the 478 is printed, though, like the last 15 minutes of the day. "
"8105340","8106920"," You got to sit there with all that danger."
"8108680","8110160"," This is firm enough up here."
"8111860","8112740"," The 47750. "
"8119270","8120710"," So 47750 would be the safety."
"8123180","8128060"," And it's nice to see we're making really good progress up here to break through above here."
"8136970","8137870"," Yeah, I'll check out. "
"8137970","8139890"," I'll check out a BA right now."
"8140250","8141850"," And I'll check out Facebook next."
"8150520","8151980"," Check out Facebook after. "
"8165230","8167710"," The thing that kills me about BA that I was telling you about."
"8167890","8168630"," Like I'd be a buyer."
"8169770","8172010"," You're looking for news on BA for sure. "
"8172910","8179470"," The news or you can check the hedge when the hedges expire on BA would be another route you'd want"
"8179470","8179810"," to take."
"8179810","8183330"," Find out when the hedge, when the hedge expires."
"8185540","8189540"," Your buyers are down below at 200, 199, and 198. "
"8190440","8191559"," Price targets 210."
"8192520","8195600"," You kind of, you're just right in the middle of the trade, right?"
"8196280","8197520"," It's not really a lot going on here."
"8198959","8200820"," You can see the money flows down here. "
"8204080","8205340"," The big money flow is down below."
"8205680","8213379"," So just set some supports down at 198, 198, and 200."
"8213379","8220530"," They're going to run to 210, or you put the risk on. "
"8221230","8222629"," That's to each of their own, right?"
"8222889","8224030"," When do you put the risk on?"
"8226660","8227900"," They're grinding options."
"8228200","8230040"," I realized that the trade was at the bell."
"8230260","8231480"," The trade was on Friday, actually. "
"8233260","8236160"," Actually, it was a few days last week we had to put trades on."
"8239580","8241260"," And Facebook looks beautiful, by the way."
"8242860","8255799"," You see all the sellers are waiting above here at 348 and 349. "
"8256540","8257059"," You've got sellers."
"8259639","8261200"," 360, though, is the goal, right?"
"8262000","8264059"," You can see this is where this is the target."
"8264639","8266160"," 360 on Facebook. "
"8268379","8272799"," If you guys put spreads on too, man, let's say we hit 360 on Friday for our Facebook."
"8273480","8274200"," Put a spread on."
"8274340","8276040"," Those are going to print regardless of how we get there. "
"8276520","8279660"," If we do the straight melt up into Friday, the spreads of your friend."
"8289190","8289610"," This is nice."
"8289809","8291670"," See this nice wall building up here at 478. "
"8294990","8295469"," 47752."
"8297170","8298950"," Be careful up once we get up there."
"8302230","8303170"," Can I show Amazon?"
"8305860","8306340"," Yep. "
"8306860","8307440"," I agree model."
"8308760","8310040"," I'll show Amazon next."
"8312139","8314040"," Yeah, those last 15 minute run ups. "
"8314219","8314520"," You end up."
"8315240","8316840"," They squeeze you out."
"8317000","8318280"," You're thinking it's not going to go there. "
"8318379","8318879"," And then it does."
"8321600","8322420"," Sometimes easier."
"8323280","8325080"," Often I'll close my spreads. "
"8326000","8328139"," When they get into the money, it opens and closes."
"8328139","8335120"," You'll notice that they print on OPEC stays."
"8342959","8343480"," All right. "
"8343740","8344139"," So Amazon."
"8346809","8350910"," Major support at 472.85. 473."
"8352010","8353950"," Minor support at 474. "
"8357920","8358840"," That's for day trading."
"8365980","8369540"," Let's look at Amazon chart."
"8377020","8380809"," Man, that's not Amazon. "
"8389130","8392910"," Let's look at 3,700 if we can get it on there."
"8393850","8395670"," Let's see where the big boys are."
"8400290","8403730"," Let's see where the big boys are on Amazon. "
"8416460","8418420"," Yeah, Amazon's a nice trade, isn't it?"
"8418940","8420340"," I like this Amazon trade."
"8430980","8432600"," It's probably my favorite trade right now."
"8438940","8441040"," More sellers right now currently than buyers. "
"8442240","8443020"," Dude, I like this trade."
"8444760","8447180"," I like this trade from like 3,388."
"8452480","8453360"," What is that?"
"8453620","8454620"," Let me see this. "
"8454620","8455240"," 3,400."
"8459530","8463090"," Man, it'd be nice to see Amazon go to like three."
"8466940","8470420"," The problem right now with Amazon is you got trap buyers. "
"8471980","8472740"," Actually, you know what?"
"8472860","8473520"," I'll be honest with you."
"8474920","8477460"," I'm not liking the Amazon trade right now."
"8478160","8481000"," I don't like these sellers still being up here. "
"8483960","8488400"," I'd really like to see these sellers be absorbed and they're not yet."
"8489280","8492180"," So I don't like the Amazon trade for today."
"8493500","8496400"," Although it could work out well into tomorrow. "
"8496700","8501940"," It'd be interesting to watch Amazon to see if these sellers are absorbed into the clothes."
"8502400","8506640"," It'd be really neat to see Amazon like sell down into clothes, believe it or not."
"8509340","8516960"," And maybe have some capitulation into clothes and then a face rip or tomorrow into Friday. "
"8517120","8518400"," This is an interesting trade here."
"8518920","8520360"," Who called that one up?"
"8523220","8524260"," Who called that Amazon?"
"8525380","8525880"," Prague."
"8526280","8527140"," I like Prague. "
"8527420","8527820"," What do you think?"
"8527980","8534400"," Tell me what your thoughts are on Amazon because man, this could be a nice setup here."
"8539250","8540410"," I like it."
"8540510","8541490"," I like the Amazon trade. "
"8541750","8543150"," What's your plan on Amazon Prague?"
"8550850","8551890"," I like your."
"8552070","8553110"," I like your."
"8553110","8554970"," Hold on a second. "
"8557710","8558450"," I like your."
"8561270","8563270"," You break through 3430."
"8563270","8564470"," You probably got some clear skies. "
"8571960","8575340"," Yeah, Amazon is the is this by trade."
"8576680","8578140"," Amazon Apple Tesla."
"8581930","8583550"," I like the Amazon trade. "
"8585870","8589330"," That might be the trade if you're a trade individual ticker."
"8592790","8597130"," If you got if any of you guys can't afford to trade Amazon, spreads are dirt cheap."
"8598090","8605090"," You don't even have to put that much risk on this little bit more. "
"8610390","8611610"," I'm going to keep an eye on them."
"8611770","8612950"," I'm going to watch Amazon today."
"8613090","8613910"," I might enter that trade. "
"8618600","8619640"," I like that trade."
"8622910","8624490"," Yeah, you can see it down here."
"8624590","8627730"," There's like 340 supplies and a nice supply zone down here. "
"8628290","8630290"," It's a really nice trade on Amazon."
"8633290","8634330"," I like this trade."
"8643710","8645210"," I'm going to set some alerts on Amazon. "
"8649950","8651210"," I really like that trade."
"8667300","8668100"," What is Amazon's?"
"8668160","8669760"," Anybody know what Amazon's ER date is?"
"8676260","8677820"," February 1st, 2022."
"8679020","8679820"," That's real nice. "
"8681300","8682520"," See, I'm so greedy."
"8683360","8683700"," I'm terrible."
"8684080","8684640"," I'm not a good guy. "
"8684820","8686680"," You're not greedy, I am."
"8687300","8692400"," I really want to see like, I really want to see a dip in the new year."
"8693340","8695460"," Like one fat dip in the new year. "
"8695740","8698160"," Trap all the bulls that want to make an ER trade."
"8701190","8701990"," And then we rip."
"8702710","8708330"," Meanwhile, everybody that bought now held through the 1st or the 3rd, they're all trapped. "
"8708670","8712410"," They have to provide more fuel to make us go ripping into ER."
"8721350","8722250"," Yeah, that's a good."
"8722490","8723490"," I agree with that one. "
"8723770","8724370"," Blood's done."
"8731540","8732460"," Holy shit."
"8732600","8733180"," Look at those calls. "
"8737880","8739380"," Power hours coming in, huh?"
"8741120","8742640"," You guys ready for power hour?"
"8743220","8744320"," NVIDIA golden ticket."
"8744720","8746160"," Five, twenty, twenty, twenty two."
"8746860","8747360"," They're going to wait. "
"8747640","8748260"," They're just going to rip it."
"8760530","8763870"," There are some real huge calls coming in right now."
"8763870","8764930"," TQQ. "
"8766930","8767830"," Apple spy."
"8768130","8768510"," TQQ."
"8768790","8770030"," Two, four, twenty two. "
"8776220","8778300"," One ninety C on TQQ."
"8778920","8781540"," I and TC calls coming in."
"8782300","8782660"," T."
"8783080","8783740"," So you got T."
"8784160","8786040"," Three, eighteen, twenty two, twenty five C."
"8787320","8787860"," I and TC. "
"8788520","8790620"," One, seven, twenty two, fifty two C."
"8791640","8791700"," AMD."
"8792600","8793960"," One, fourteen, twenty two."
"8794480","8794860"," So, okay. "
"8795160","8795760"," This is huge."
"8823670","8825950"," I'm going to post this stuff on Twitter for you guys."
"8830610","8833010"," You got some ER plays coming out right now. "
"8833350","8834230"," This is very bullish."
"8859280","8860680"," Let me see if I've got this right."
"8863540","8865240"," Lots of BA calls coming in. "
"8865460","8866680"," Some of you guys are asking about BA."
"8866960","8867660"," What's going on with BA?"
"8870590","8871370"," In the air."
"8872190","8872890"," Anything tight. "
"8876070","8878670"," There must be some BA news coming out that we don't know about."
"8878890","8879890"," Or it's ER stuff."
"8888450","8889670"," It's a major flow coming in. "
"8893130","8893730"," Can't lie."
"8904210","8906930"," Bulls are getting serious right now."
"8906930","8927630"," Let me"
"8927630","8929450"," put this up here real quick. "
"8953470","8954070"," AMD."
"8954650","8955890"," AMD's got some banging."
"8956410","8956870"," Like AMD. "
"8958170","8961290"," One, fourteen, twenty two, one, seventy five."
"8964310","8964910"," Nvidia."
"8989370","8991690"," So you also need to know that. "
"8992530","8994350"," This expands the gamma."
"8995650","8997030"," Positive gamma in the market."
"9001040","9003360"," When you start to see calls into January. "
"9004280","9005560"," It's a positive for the market."
"9012710","9015430"," You've been looking for these calls to come in."
"9015430","9017010"," Heading into January. "
"9017310","9018310"," We didn't see these calls."
"9019050","9020990"," Earlier last week, week before."
"9036650","9037710"," Just grinding away. "
"9038450","9039110"," Grinding away."
"9040410","9041410"," It's a song."
"9046220","9046720"," A little bit more. "
"9047720","9049020"," That's what we're looking for right there."
"9053900","9054480"," That's even cleaner."
"9057090","9057110"," Right?"
"9057330","9058730"," So you see your buy levels, right?"
"9058950","9065810"," 473, 474.87. See your cell signals above 47778. "
"9066470","9069190"," Targets are, what do we call them at it?"
"9069930","9074930"," 477.84. 478.45. Ultimately, 480."
"9076170","9078050"," 479.93 to be more exact."
"9079350","9081450"," To give you your, your entries and exits. "
"9088210","9088810"," H as."
"9090590","9091650"," Power our drink power."
"9092370","9094270"," Yeah, I'm going to probably sign off here for a minute. "
"9097170","9107860"," And yeah,"
"9107900","9109100"," the pressure is definitely building."
"9110460","9114290"," What am I missing here?"
"9121540","9122780"," Just grinding away."
"9124720","9127100"," Wait till you look at the charts for this week on Friday. "
"9127100","9129240"," Like you're going to look at the Monday through Friday chart."
"9129840","9130700"," And it's just going to be this."
"9131320","9132320"," See this spy chart?"
"9132960","9138100"," You're going to see this spy chart in a five day chart more than likely as we make our way"
"9138100","9138620"," into Friday. "
"9138820","9139320"," It's just stupid."
"9139820","9141080"," It's one slow melt up."
"9142760","9143480"," Free money. "
"9144580","9147260"," Buy yourself a spread somewhere and just watch it."
"9147260","9149120"," Just watch it rip and melt up."
"9153710","9156090"," Slow grind all the way, all the way into Friday. "
"9156090","9158150"," Or, well, until they hit their price target."
"9158910","9159410"," It doesn't matter."
"9159550","9160790"," The date doesn't matter what it happens. "
"9161450","9162750"," It doesn't matter if it's Friday, Monday."
"9163810","9164730"," It doesn't matter if it's Thursday."
"9165290","9166250"," It doesn't matter what day it is. "
"9166370","9168030"," You just know that they have price targets in mind."
"9176640","9178020"," Peton, ready for this?"
"9178240","9179820"," Any of you, Peton lovers out there."
"9180340","9185740"," Someone's betting on January 20th for a strike of 55C. "
"9192820","9194940"," I like this trade too."
"9195120","9202220"," Viacom 1231, 31C costs 21 cents for 11 grand."
"9202600","9204160"," Someone dropped on that Viacom trade. "
"9204400","9205320"," I like that trade a lot."
"9206900","9207560"," Be hilarious."
"9207920","9209180"," Viacom announces a merger. "
"9209980","9211660"," You turn 11 grand into 50 million."
"9215080","9216800"," I like trading Viacom."
"9217340","9218500"," It comes floating down. "
"9218500","9220140"," It gets bought back up."
"9220860","9222460"," Viacom has been very tradable."
"9224880","9226420"," Some great trades in Viacom. "
"9227120","9230140"," Set alerts down at like 28 bucks, 29 bucks."
"9230340","9234820"," Every time it bounces down there, buy some 10 cent calls and it rips."
"9236620","9241100"," And in reality, if you make that trade, you guys want to hear this out there, okay?"
"9241840","9244900"," I haven't been talking about this trade a lot to people. "
"9245400","9246640"," Every now and again, I'll bring it up."
"9248540","9251400"," So my thesis on Viacom is this."
"9253260","9256880"," Every time Viacom comes down here to these levels, right?"
"9257400","9258920"," It's 28, 29 bucks. "
"9259720","9262500"," And in this area down here, it gets bought."
"9262840","9266080"," One, two, three, four, five, five times it's been bought."
"9266880","9272320"," And I was talking to some big trader on Twitter about this. "
"9273180","9274120"," And that would be that."
"9274120","9282480"," What you do with Viacom is you can just buy 10 cent calls on Viacom from now for the rest"
"9282480","9283160"," of the year."
"9283860","9286560"," In my view, you can just buy those calls. "
"9287120","9293680"," And it doesn't matter if they print or not, because at some point in this next three months to a"
"9293680","9296140"," year, you'll get small prints."
"9296200","9298480"," But what you're really looking for is the big hit."
"9299260","9301180"," It costs some money to make this trade. "
"9301180","9308500"," It might cost you some serious money to make it, but you just need that one hit where Viacom"
"9308500","9309000"," announces."
"9309200","9315600"," Let's say you're sitting in like five cent, 10 cent trade, 10 cent calls on Viacom."
"9316880","9319200"," And you make that trade every month or so. "
"9320180","9324900"," Once it comes down here, you place one of those trades on, you leave it on."
"9326320","9330360"," Forward announcement that they've either merged or sold or bought or whatever."
"9331660","9334260"," Because you know that there's a takeover going on. "
"9334380","9336840"," They want the stock as cheap as they can get it."
"9337020","9340420"," But the moment that it happens, that stock's going to rip like stupid."
"9340700","9345780"," It'll go to like 70, 60, 70, possibly a hundred. "
"9347520","9351380"," And you'd make thousands and thousands and thousands of percent."
"9351380","9354880"," And it looks like people are starting to trade Viacom."
"9355140","9356280"," No one was trading it. "
"9356620","9359180"," And then people started trading it the past couple of weeks."
"9360160","9366040"," It's one of my favorite trades out there for if you guys are looking for like a squeeze play that"
"9366040","9367520"," could take place the next year."
"9369060","9371480"," It's definitely, you can look at it. "
"9371520","9376880"," It was at $101 and it would not shock me to see it and not make an announcement."
"9376880","9381360"," And you just put on some stupid, stupid, stupid outside the money."
"9381920","9386620"," Dirt cheap every time that bounces down at that $28, $29 level. "
"9387160","9389880"," And you trade it for one to three months."
"9390760","9396160"," And you just keep adding on to it every every, you roll them into a new trade until something is"
"9396160","9396440"," announced."
"9397300","9399660"," Even if you burn them, let's say trades down to 20 bucks. "
"9400000","9400520"," It doesn't matter."
"9400660","9405300"," You go back in with a back in with another 10 cent or five cent call way outside the money,"
"9405520","9406180"," two cent calls."
"9406180","9407180"," I don't care what you trade them. "
"9407500","9411400"," And you just, you just make sure you're in the play for when the announcement is made."
"9411940","9416980"," And if you're in for that trade, you're going to make some stupid money, like stupid money."
"9418220","9420400"," My favorite trade of 2022 right now. "
"9422820","9426640"," I think I've talked about this a couple of times, at least once or twice I've mentioned it."
"9430100","9430760"," And then Peton."
"9431600","9435560"," So let me look at Peton real quick and why people are buying the Peton trade. "
"9436560","9438180"," Probably has to do with the hedging on it."
"9439320","9441300"," Has to look at that stuff."
"9441740","9445200"," I get Peton's at 35 bucks just got destroyed. "
"9447060","9448140"," Straight destroyed."
"9449940","9450480"," Wrecked."
"9453340","9454600"," Peton's gotten wrecked. "
"9459780","9463080"," So that trade that they just shouted out to you on Peton."
"9463560","9465100"," That was what was that trade."
"9467700","9469800"," And dude, look at all this stupid stuff that just came out. "
"9470080","9471500"," So tons of apple calls."
"9473420","9478760"," More apple calls, more spy calls, more Rivian calls, more Pete, or you got Peton call."
"9479160","9481040"," I'll post this on Twitter for you right now. "
"9481660","9483060"," You know, like that Peton call."
"9483980","9487260"," It probably take a farther out strike on that call."
"9488040","9489120"," A little bit more in the money. "
"9491420","9493740"," But you know it's going to rip at some point."
"9493880","9498240"," I hate Peton, but you know, but we're trading the market, not, not always."
"9499360","9500280"," The ticker. "
"9539920","9544620"," Yeah, I mean, we talked about this and we had a, we had a discussion last night."
"9545340","9548260"," We had a discussion last night about how I trade."
"9549280","9553740"," I'm looking for those calls, like 55 C's or 10 cents. "
"9554720","9557100"," You know, it's not, it's not that."
"9557320","9560980"," I mean, you know that there are funds out there, you know, there are hedge funds out there and."
"9561960","9567340"," That are just, you got some small young kid comes in and says, Hey, look, boss, we can buy. "
"9568500","9571560"," Some 55 C's on this ticker."
"9571880","9576340"," And we'll do is we'll lift the hedges off or the, we'll lift the shorts off."
"9577180","9579440"," And we'll go long as fucking this stock. "
"9580300","9582600"," And we'll, you know, we'll let the hedges expire."
"9582980","9583940"," We'll pull the shorts off."
"9584260","9587680"," It'll rip higher and we're going to print on both sides, right?"
"9587680","9589900"," We printed most of our profit on the short side. "
"9590340","9592500"," And now we're going to print a ton of profit on the long side."
"9592840","9598400"," And by the time it's back at 55 and you got people like us retail traders going, Oh, Peton's coming"
"9598400","9598660"," back."
"9598820","9600280"," Peton's going to 60 or 70. "
"9600660","9602860"," They were already in and out gone long gone."
"9612010","9612590"," Hey, Chaz."
"9613050","9613490"," How are you?"
"9621920","9624480"," We were talking about looking for these cheaper trades, right?"
"9624760","9626560"," When do you buy calls when they're 10 cents?"
"9627140","9628680"," When do you buy puts when they're 10 cents?"
"9631080","9631620"," Does it always work?"
"9631800","9631880"," No. "
"9632220","9633040"," Do I trade well?"
"9633040","9635100"," When we melt up, I don't."
"9635880","9642480"," But when we're trading like this, we're trading at supports or known supports and resistances, I"
"9642480","9647660"," trade pretty well in these circumstances because I'm defined for my risk, right?"
"9647960","9648520"," We're kind of."
"9652640","9654540"," And so I traded this into the open today. "
"9654700","9655440"," I got out of my trade."
"9655660","9662220"," I'm looking to reenter at 474.69. I have, I might end up missing this trade if we trade up"
"9662220","9662540"," to 480."
"9663240","9665840"," For seven, three, it'd be a huge dip buyer down here. "
"9666300","9669000"," But we know how Christmas or the holiday trade works."
"9669700","9671200"," And usually we just grind."
"9671600","9675340"," We'll just end up grinding up to 4800 at some point this week. "
"9680100","9682100"," I hate all companies on stock market agreed."
"9689040","9690360"," I'm guessing snap is a better."
"9691260","9692160"," Let's take a look at snap. "
"9693080","9694200"," Well, I think so."
"9694420","9701140"," Just generally speaking, during Santa rally, generally speaking, it's better to put on spreads than"
"9701140","9701900"," it is to."
"9701900","9704640"," Buy naked options. "
"9705840","9711540"," Generally speaking, this time right now, spreads are your friend for this grind up."
"9718760","9720200"," Unless you, there's a moment of weakness."
"9720520","9725360"," If there's a moment of weakness and you can grab a dip by, then you combine our naked options. "
"9726080","9732740"," But generally speaking here, when you're dealing with the melt up situation that takes place most"
"9732740","9735400"," years, the spreads are your friend."
"9735400","9741800"," In the money call spread, hold them until we get to your price target."
"9744640","9750490"," So 4866 price target. "
"9750790","9754470"," You got a price target here of 60 bucks on snap."
"9757480","9760260"," It looks like it looks like it's still being pinned."
"9761420","9767000"," And I haven't looked to see you guys can check the options change and find out where the hedging"
"9767000","9767840"," comes off. "
"9770180","9774200"," On these tickers, if any of this hedging does come off, they will squeeze."
"9775140","9779880"," So maybe you just buy and hold, you can do that, that thought that process as well."
"9780500","9784740"," It all depends on what your, what your thinking is going to happen, right?"
"9785180","9786380"," But what's your thesis?"
"9788140","9790100"," So my thesis is that we go to 480. "
"9791020","9796260"," My thesis is that there'll be a chance to buy a dip down here and down down here."
"9797700","9800500"," I might miss, my theory might not work, right?"
"9800660","9802000"," I might miss my trade."
"9802660","9805020"," And we just go, we just straight melt up to 478. "
"9808080","9817580"," I bought my, so what I did for my spreads is I bought 478, 477 call spreads when they were"
"9817580","9818340"," pennies."
"9819120","9825820"," And then I sold them to other traders out there that say, Hey, there's more juice in this between"
"9825820","9826420"," now and Friday."
"9826420","9830600"," So now you guys have, or not you guys, but some people out there have my spreads and they're"
"9830600","9837600"," saying, Yeah, we're going to take this to 478, 480 into Friday or Monday or whatever next week. "
"9842640","9842880"," Right."
"9843080","9847040"," And so now I'm looking to make entry, if I can get entry on a long here, I will take"
"9847040","9847220"," it."
"9847520","9850060"," But if I don't, let's say I missed this entry into a long. "
"9850420","9856920"," So then I'm going to be looking for the short side up at 478 or 480, possibly even 483 to"
"9856920","9857860"," take the market short."
"9865040","9876090"," Hey, just"
"9876090","9877410"," buy some spreads, forget it."
"9877670","9879070"," You just said them and forget them. "
"9882880","9884780"," I do like that Peton trade too."
"9885040","9886480"," I like the Amazon trade right now."
"9886540","9887560"," I like the Peton trade. "
"9888560","9893900"," I don't like the Viacom trade yet, but I will like the Viacom trade."
"9895440","9897300"," Will like a Viacom trade."
"9905350","9907610"," If I can get a strike down. "
"9911150","9913570"," We can touch like 2960."
"9913750","9914990"," I'm a buyer on that trade."
"9916630","9919750"," On the Viacom trade for penny, for petty, petty calls. "
"9922970","9924330"," Love that Viacom trade."
"9924550","9925690"," And this is another thing to think about."
"9926410","9932610"," You know, when you see meltups in the market, you'll see some tickers are not melting up like snap. "
"9933010","9936410"," When you're seeing a ticker like that, not melting up, it's because of the hedging in the shorts"
"9936410","9937050"," that are on it."
"9937570","9939350"," You'll see that on Viacom as well."
"9939350","9941850"," So you're like, well, how do I trade those?"
"9942970","9944210"," You're trading them on news. "
"9944950","9947230"," You're trading them on the hedges coming off when they come off."
"9947410","9948890"," I think they all come off in the 31st."
"9949230","9953650"," So maybe you'll see Thursday is a huge dripper for snap war the day after. "
"9954010","9958830"," Maybe the market crash it or not crashes, but pulls back on Monday on the third and then you'll see"
"9958830","9961010"," snap come up because the hedge was lifted."
"9961490","9966390"," You'll see companies like Viacom, if the market's dumping heavily, you'll see Viacom just kind of"
"9966390","9968350"," bounce around down at that $29 mark."
"9969530","9970670"," It won't go any lower. "
"9971130","9972750"," So you'll have some safety in those trades."
"9975490","9975950"," All right."
"9975970","9976750"," So here's what I'm going to do. "
"9976810","9977970"," I'm going to sign off for a little bit."
"9978030","9981450"," I'll check back in with you guys at 3 p.m. I look forward for it."
"9981610","9985490"," I mean, I'm going to do is I'm going to leave the feed up and I'll just unplug my microphone"
"9985490","9987050"," and I'll come back at 3 o'clock. "
"14324700","14325440"," Check one too."
"14340980","14341780"," All right."
"14342000","14342620"," Here we go. "
"14347530","14370680"," Let's take a"
"14370680","14370680"," look."
"14372240","14372840"," Okay."
"14372840","14375860"," Just a second boys and girls. "
"14404900","14430200"," What are we looking at 78"
"14430200","14431140"," watching right now?"
"14431180","14431860"," You guys all here?"
"14432380","14433200"," You guys hear me?"
"14437220","14437820"," Yeah."
"14438020","14438780"," So you saw some."
"14441270","14442530"," Let me turn off. "
"14443350","14451980"," I thought my desktop audio was on the audio inputs on."
"14452120","14452480"," Okay, we're good."
"14453740","14454820"," All right. "
"14455080","14455140"," Nope."
"14455140","14457860"," Just a second here."
"14462240","14462700"," All right. "
"14465130","14467590"," So we had some hedging come in, right?"
"14467710","14469190"," We dipped with the hedging that came in."
"14470050","14471090"," That's to be expected."
"14483220","14484640"," We know that we'll sell you guys. "
"14484820","14485820"," I want you guys to."
"14489690","14494610"," I want you guys to see the effect of hedging on the market."
"14498380","14501640"," And you'll see also put flow into that hedging and weakness. "
"14502220","14506280"," And that is the point that I'm making is that when JPM comes over and throws that collar on."
"14507160","14509280"," You're going to see that same weakness in the market."
"14511620","14515960"," Now into tomorrow before you guys want to call for tomorrow. "
"14520450","14522190"," Here's my point heading into tomorrow."
"14522770","14524730"," So I'm going to give everybody a few minutes to pile in here."
"14538470","14538750"," All right. "
"14538890","14538910"," Good."
"14539130","14539130"," Good."
"14539790","14541070"," So you're 105 in here right now. "
"14541130","14543670"," Looks like we're getting another group of people in here."
"14544150","14547390"," So I want to talk to you guys about a few things."
"14563580","14571160"," So it wouldn't surprise me to see us trade up into after hours. "
"14571820","14577860"," So we tag up into 47780, 47680, something like that."
"14578000","14578600"," It's after hours."
"14579160","14584120"," And then we sell down into tomorrow's open. "
"14586100","14589900"," So we sell that into tomorrow and then we rebuy again."
"14590240","14592540"," So what would my take on today be?"
"14595910","14598810"," Let me have a look at the water flow right now."
"14598830","14599610"," The options flow. "
"14604210","14606030"," We get some calls expiring today."
"14606770","14612210"," You've got people holding 475s for expiring on Wednesday at 234."
"14613030","14615290"," It calls at 34 cents for 75C. "
"14621780","14623220"," You know, if you're in deep enough."
"14624300","14626200"," It's pretty easy to hold through."
"14626560","14629420"," If you're in spreads, it's easy to hold through into Friday. "
"14629420","14634420"," If you're in deep enough and calls like you bought early enough, you're probably okay."
"14635000","14637940"," My concern with tomorrow is going to be."
"14642890","14646410"," Let's say we see like a dip on Tuesday, right?"
"14649730","14651230"," I wouldn't say sell the market. "
"14651390","14652270"," I would say more of a dip."
"14652650","14653950"," Let's say we dip on Tuesday."
"14655470","14660910"," You do about a dip type thing on Tuesday at the open because it'd be easy where we are right"
"14660910","14663410"," now for a short rate in the overnight. "
"14663410","14672470"," So if I was trading futures right now, I would be looking to sell down futures rights dealers"
"14672470","14673590"," selling futures."
"14675970","14677790"," And then we go back up again tomorrow."
"14678910","14680690"," That's going to be my call for tomorrow. "
"14681010","14681950"," What does that mean though?"
"14682070","14684950"," It means that some of you might panic at some point tomorrow if you're holding long."
"14685750","14692310"," It's probably an opportunity for futures to sell this down, but I don't know that it's an"
"14692310","14695230"," opportunity for options holders to sell us down."
"14695530","14696070"," It's possible. "
"14696490","14703550"," It's possible if you waited until 4.15 to get some puts, you might be able to trade that down."
"14703850","14708830"," Now that's probably, I'm going to give that like a 60% chance of happening."
"14710450","14715230"," And it's a 40% chance that you're going to find dip by it. "
"14715310","14717010"," Well, let's stay on that 60% chance."
"14717010","14719650"," So let's say we did sell down until tomorrow's open."
"14719790","14719950"," Okay. "
"14722670","14724770"," So you're seeing some of the buyers down here disappear."
"14725550","14729090"," Coming back slightly over here, but this band right here, they're kind of gone."
"14732350","14733930"," Yeah, see this group right here?"
"14735960","14738000"," This group of buyers is gone right here. "
"14738260","14738900"," You guys see this?"
"14739440","14744620"," Do you see this line up here getting a little bit stronger at this 4.77, 50, 4.78?"
"14745240","14750480"," So we could possibly trade up into 47, 50 or 47, 80 and after hours."
"14750500","14756800"," That wouldn't surprise me to see us, you know, trade up to 47, 80 longs take out their long"
"14756800","14757360"," positions."
"14757680","14762520"," And then in the after hours, crew comes in, not the after hours, the, the pajama traders come in at"
"14762520","14767560"," 6 p.m. And they go, oh, wow, we're up at 47, 50 or 47, 80. "
"14768340","14769280"," And we're going to sell this down."
"14769940","14770740"," And we have a moment of weakness."
"14771040","14771940"," We've got lots of supply. "
"14773100","14774240"," Then they sell it down."
"14774500","14775500"," And what do they sell it down to?"
"14775600","14781460"," Maybe they sell it down to 4.73, 4.71, 4.70 is possible."
"14782620","14787600"," And then make another run up to 4.78 or 4.80. So I think that's on the table. "
"14788240","14792900"," We could possibly sell it down right here to 4.75. You see this nice band right here."
"14794060","14795340"," That wouldn't surprise me."
"14797580","14800280"," So I'm going to give that a 60% chance of happening. "
"14802100","14811890"," It does look like the imbalance isn't too bad, but it wouldn't surprise me here that where"
"14811890","14813490"," it's my point behind this though is that."
"14814590","14820970"," This looks like an opportunity for after hours, traders and after hours for pajama traders and not"
"14820970","14823130"," for the day traders."
"14823330","14824530"," So if it was me. "
"14824530","14834410"," I would either look to wrap up mistimed longs or take profit on longs into clothes"
"14834410","14837990"," and then come back to it again tomorrow."
"14839790","14841090"," Now, let's say we go up."
"14841190","14847390"," Let's say we, let's say tonight we gap up to 4.80. You'd still be selling the open tomorrow for"
"14847390","14852230"," 80 or not for 40, 4.78. It's still be selling that open tomorrow. "
"14852510","14853130"," So think about that."
"14853470","14861410"," When you're trading think what's what's our price target 4.78 and we're at 4.7661. It leaves a"
"14861410","14864890"," dollar 40 room to gap up tomorrow."
"14865510","14867950"," So if you leave that in the overnight to happen. "
"14869690","14877430"," You wind up, you know, you're in a very risky situation where longs with equity will sell their"
"14877430","14877810"," positions."
"14877810","14879490"," You'll get trapped in calls."
"14880470","14881870"," So what do you do here?"
"14882150","14885250"," You're, we're trading back up here into the close. "
"14886370","14888070"," You know, we're already back up in here."
"14888130","14894830"," We're already almost back up here at 4.7655. So this looks like your chance to take your profit and"
"14894830","14895050"," run."
"14896310","14899910"," Or you are attaching a lot of risk into tomorrow. "
"14899930","14902050"," So let's say some of you are saying yourselves."
"14902530","14903290"," I'm going to hold long."
"14903750","14904990"," Not listening to the captain. "
"14904990","14906550"," You can piss off."
"14908690","14909130"," Okay."
"14909310","14919160"," Well, then I would say, I would say if you're"
"14919160","14920080"," staying in your lungs. "
"14926520","14929180"," Look at those four sixties for five cents."
"14930020","14936680"," I'd say buy some four 66 puts for 10 cents."
"14937380","14940660"," Spiring on the 29th or some four seventies. "
"14942220","14946780"," Expiring in the 28 or for 28 cents for four 70 to 28 cents."
"14947180","14948040"," And here's what you do."
"14948180","14952380"," You would stay in your lungs by just two or three. "
"14952460","14953060"," No, not two or three."
"14953160","14957940"," But you just buy, you know, just a little two or three percent in some in some puts."
"14958500","14959540"," And that does two things. "
"14960460","14961560"," It'll protect you."
"14963120","14965540"," Whatever losses that you have into the open."
"14965540","14972540"," If it sticks and things get crazy, then you could hold on to them or roll more into them and"
"14972540","14973160"," dump your calls. "
"14978960","14981420"," As a matter of fact, I'm probably taking a put position."
"14984440","14987660"," I didn't buy the dip down here either."
"14987920","14988300"," I didn't like. "
"14988500","14989760"," I don't think that dip is enough."
"14990780","14993160"," This is a good run right here, heading up into close."
"14993620","14996920"," I'll probably grab some puts at the bell, even if they burn. "
"15000010","15001770"," Let me know real quick what you guys are thinking."
"15001770","15003590"," I want to see what you guys are thinking right now."
"15005890","15007590"," What does Tesla look like?"
"15007850","15008110"," Let's see. "
"15027910","15031410"," If deal gets alleged next year, one point for me was worth it."
"15031690","15034450"," I took profit a bit early going for all time highs now."
"15034630","15034990"," High of day. "
"15035230","15037690"," No need to squeeze every last penny and risk losing gains in hand."
"15038310","15043430"," Yeah, so I think we'll get the all time highs right now or we're going to get them."
"15044650","15051480"," Or we'll get them in after hours. "
"15058820","15059640"," See here."
"15068040","15070580"," We're near that 1,100 tag up here, right?"
"15071460","15072360"," So I'd tussle."
"15072420","15073080"," I've got 1092. "
"15073600","15076680"," You see some weak resistance here at 1,100, 1,05."
"15077580","15082040"," And you've got some sellers way above here at 1,10 on Tesla."
"15085300","15086640"," So you got to you got to remember. "
"15087740","15088620"," Got to remember."
"15088820","15088960"," Okay."
"15089680","15094980"," So where we are in the markets, where you're trying to take profit at. "
"15094980","15097440"," What your price target is."
"15097800","15099320"," So at 476, 74."
"15099800","15101200"," Let's say we rip up into clothes. "
"15102000","15106160"," Let's say we tagged 478 in the after hours, 480 in the after all, even 480."
"15107000","15109000"," Do we gap up to 480 in cash tomorrow?"
"15109600","15109620"," Possibly."
"15110380","15112880"," Do we hit 478 in the after hours?"
"15113700","15116420"," And then the sellers step in in the overnight and you kind of screwed. "
"15117080","15118640"," So you got to ask yourself that question."
"15118760","15120020"," You can stay in your lungs."
"15121060","15126360"," But my point to you is going to be that you need to throw some protection on here. "
"15126780","15128080"," This is my only warning."
"15128820","15132400"," Is that if you're saying we're going to 478, we're going to 480."
"15132920","15134420"," I believe you that we are. "
"15134960","15136500"," But let's look at the timing of it."
"15136500","15143220"," And then as we get to it, start to think like we're on the book when the bear or like"
"15143220","15147680"," we're in the bottoms of the markets, start to think about putting on some insurance."
"15148500","15151100"," At least start to think about throwing on some cheap puts. "
"15151660","15153500"," And Wednesday puts are dirt cheap right now."
"15153980","15158860"," You got 462s or excuse me got 470s at 27 cents."
"15159380","15164420"," It wouldn't shock me to see them go to 25 cents 24 cents into the bell. "
"15164920","15167960"," And then we pick them up and we use them for insurance."
"15169500","15174120"," Where's you know, if you guys don't want to lose that much money, how about you buy yourself some"
"15174120","15175180"," 460s."
"15175940","15178440"," I mean, they're not going to gain value unless we dump a ton. "
"15178440","15181400"," But they've got two days on them."
"15182860","15185740"," So they don't expire until 29th."
"15189030","15190050"," If the bears freak out. "
"15191790","15193190"," Let's say you buy some for."
"15194870","15199210"," For 60 P's they'll be worth 10 cents by morning or by end of day tomorrow."
"15200470","15201870"," If that happens. "
"15202810","15203990"," So let's say if."
"15205030","15206830"," If we do actually hit a top."
"15207510","15208890"," In after hours overnight. "
"15210310","15212750"," By Wednesday in the 29th expiry."
"15214190","15217990"," And we just start, you know, like rabbit, rapidly selling off for a day or two."
"15218690","15222830"," You know that even if you let them, even if you cut them loose at the end of the day"
"15222830","15223910"," on Tuesday. "
"15225150","15226330"," Hand them off to a bear."
"15227050","15228590"," At 345 on Tuesday."
"15231650","15234990"," That you'll get good money for them because they'll think that that's going to print into"
"15234990","15236650"," Wednesday, even if we go back up on Wednesday. "
"15237490","15240790"," And you guys remember that Tuesday's famous."
"15241730","15244650"," For going in the opposite direction of wherever we were on Monday."
"15252940","15253000"," Right. "
"15257370","15259470"," There's no need to be wasting all that money."
"15260690","15262870"," On a on a hedge that's."
"15263390","15265830"," The problem with getting a hedge that's that far out. "
"15267570","15269050"," Is that they wear them out."
"15272300","15273420"," It's better to spend."
"15276700","15277620"," I've said it enough. "
"15277720","15278760"," You guys have heard me talk enough."
"15279580","15280520"," On that topic."
"15285750","15287450"," So here we go up here for 11 15. "
"15289010","15289830"," 11 10."
"15290510","15291850"," You got clear skies on Tesla."
"15292730","15294090"," My question is only. "
"15295650","15297290"," Where do we hit that top is it?"
"15297450","15299490"," We're hitting that top in the after hours in the regular hours."
"15299610","15300550"," We all know what happens."
"15302090","15304810"," When we hit some major resistance in after hours. "
"15305950","15307970"," If it's light resistance, it's not so bad."
"15308150","15310350"," There's some room on Tesla to go up and after hours."
"15311930","15315110"," You got another 15 20 $20 you can throw on there. "
"15318960","15321800"," But on the spy, my only concern is."
"15323950","15327490"," We got these high these sellers hiding up here at 47."
"15328770","15335890"," They're hiding up here 47 7.63. So that's my warning to you. "
"15337270","15340970"," And I don't think you need to date these things and pay big money for them."
"15341490","15342370"," I think you see."
"15342830","15345210"," I think you end up seeing on the 29th, you see. "
"15347640","15351220"," And anyone that thinks we're selling down into Friday is smoking crack in my book."
"15351800","15352820"," I don't think it's there."
"15353800","15357760"," I think you buy like these four sixties for like five cents. "
"15359480","15366140"," Or you buy four 68 for 16 cents, 17 cents for the data for the 29th."
"15366360","15367060"," You got two more days."
"15367300","15368680"," You got Monday or you got Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"15372010","15373870"," If you stay long because there are some people stay along."
"15373870","15377990"," We've got a lot of people holding on to 475 C's dated for the 29th."
"15378010","15379930"," You got 60,000 people holding the holding those. "
"15380790","15390550"," You've also got on the 31st whole slew of people holding 480 C's 126,000 contracts on 480"
"15390550","15391610"," C for Friday."
"15392410","15393970"," So I see the market selling off probably not."
"15394730","15396270"," But do I see some weakness on Tuesday?"
"15397170","15399910"," Like, you know, if I was a short or if I was a, you know, if I was a short"
"15399910","15404770"," guy, there are 4,700 right now heading into the close, right?"
"15405130","15406690"," Chances of us hitting 4,780. "
"15408390","15412270"," Into the close is pretty high into after hours pretty high."
"15413390","15420560"," And I think it sets it up for for a trigger to to sell down or be weak on Tuesday."
"15423650","15424470"," It's a setup. "
"15425710","15426570"," In my view."
"15429270","15430330"," And I could be wrong."
"15430570","15433990"," So that's my point is that if you're looking at this from the perspective of a bull. "
"15435530","15439130"," As you take your profits at the bell as much as you can get."
"15439650","15445090"," You got to remember that the, that the after the bell, if we're going up like this into the bell."
"15446230","15447610"," A few things will happen. "
"15448250","15451690"," You will either do a cashback tomorrow, right?"
"15452250","15453770"," So we'll, we'll commit a cash market."
"15453770","15456810"," If we gap up, we'll come back down and revisit this number down here."
"15456810","15465970"," We'll revisit a probably 47, 50, 67 or 47, 62. "
"15467850","15469590"," So you take your profit up here."
"15469710","15470110"," Well, hold on."
"15470210","15473130"," So we'll probably revisit this tomorrow. "
"15473630","15476490"," This area if we gap up in the overnight and whatever anyways."
"15479020","15482640"," And if let's say we gap up into the overnight and let's say we're up at 478."
"15483540","15485800"," Then we've hit our real target, right?"
"15486280","15488200"," We've got some resistance above air at 480. "
"15488720","15491020"," But in reality, there's some sellers hiding here."
"15491260","15494640"," So if I was like a short, if I was trying to run a short operation, I'd be running it"
"15494640","15497800"," in the after hours, because it'll trigger the algos to sell."
"15498680","15501420"," And we'll find weakness into Tuesday morning. "
"15501800","15505700"," So I don't know, I would say you can stay long here, but I would say buy some protection."
"15506260","15512720"," If you've made enough money heading into this close, the wise thing to do would be to take your"
"15512720","15515300"," profits and get back at it again tomorrow."
"15515300","15517700"," And it doesn't matter if it's the short side. "
"15517860","15521700"," If we hit 480 and start selling at the bell, we can, we can ride that down tomorrow."
"15522220","15526040"," So you may, you know, guaranteed you made money today, guarantee you're making money tomorrow,"
"15526040","15526500"," right?"
"15527120","15530600"," So if you're going to stay long, you're at least put some protection on with some cheap puts."
"15531140","15537820"," If you're a bear and you want to go short and go crazy, you might be better off trading futures. "
"15539220","15548020"," If you want to go short or just single dates, because I don't think that the market goes down for"
"15548020","15548520"," the whole week."
"15549100","15555760"," I think we go back up again once more, and then we sell down on Friday, Friday or Friday into"
"15555760","15556120"," Monday."
"15556860","15559520"," But I could be wrong, you know, I'm not always right here. "
"15559960","15560880"," Why you guys know that?"
"15564050","15566830"," I didn't like to step by down here because I didn't think we had enough ramp."
"15567350","15568030"," How are you going to close?"
"15568390","15569850"," Well, I did, but I don't think we have enough ramp."
"15569850","15572950"," For where it ends up. "
"15575890","15576970"," I think this is a trap."
"15577590","15578330"," If I had to guess."
"15579810","15583650"," So I would take my profit up here and get out. "
"15586330","15588290"," You know, and everything points towards us up tomorrow."
"15588770","15594730"," I'm looking at spy calls coming in at 346 for 1229, 478s."
"15595150","15600510"," I see calls coming in for just for today, zero dates for today. "
"15600510","15604450"," I see TQQ 128."
"15606130","15609010"," For January 28th, 172 C's."
"15609710","15614550"," I see some more calls coming in spy 1229, 480 C."
"15615270","15620970"," I see one January 3rd for 477 C's on the spy. "
"15622230","15626070"," I see a light puts on XL V, I W M."
"15627150","15630610"," Let's see XL V 1231 141."
"15632010","15633130"," 1231 140."
"15633970","15636850"," Yeah, 141 two times on XL V puts. "
"15637210","15643270"," And then I see I W M puts 1231 224."
"15645510","15647690"," See some more P time calls coming in."
"15648190","15650030"," Lots of buyers on spy right now. "
"15650070","15652670"," Some sellers on QQQs and the equity side of things."
"15653790","15654890"," But no honesty."
"15656430","15658990"," Be prepared for that happening tomorrow. "
"15659310","15661550"," Be prepared for what like what's the worst that can happen tomorrow."
"15662070","15665410"," And I just told you, you can see the buy program that's on right now."
"15665810","15670910"," 180 buyers on spy, only 161 sellers will probably rip up into the clothes. "
"15671910","15676370"," The wind surprised me to keep ripping straight into right now into the into 415."
"15678870","15686130"," When shopping to see us go go crazy hiring to close into that 478 hit that target."
"15686610","15690350"," You can see all these buyers stepping in now, but I would be. "
"15690650","15694530"," So I'm looking right now at the four 15 for 14."
"15695050","15696290"," I'm looking to buy some puts."
"15697030","15699090"," So I'm going to wait until four 14. "
"15699130","15700750"," I'll tell you exactly what I'm going to buy."
"15705440","15706780"," I'm probably looking at."
"15710900","15714660"," Yeah, I'm probably going to buy some December 29 for 70 P."
"15714660","15718380"," But I'm waiting until I want to see him bleed off a little bit more. "
"15723250","15726270"," Now you guys always want me to be bullish and I am bullish."
"15726950","15727930"," I'm bullish on tomorrow."
"15727990","15729270"," I'm bullish on the entire week. "
"15729970","15735210"," I just don't like when we don't like when we're hitting 478 right at the bell."
"15761400","15764240"," Then get those 470 P's for like 20 cents."
"15764420","15765100"," I'd be a happy man. "
"15776170","15779550"," Yeah, I don't hedge that often, but when it's that cheap, why not?"
"15779810","15781690"," Yeah, I don't typically buy puts."
"15781930","15783890"," I like to buy puts when they're dirt cheap when they're pennies."
"15783890","15786370"," I don't like buying $2 or $3 puts. "
"15787390","15792950"," I love when they go from like 20 cents to like $8, $10, $12."
"15796730","15805850"," And where we are in the markets at some point around here, we're probably going to see some"
"15805850","15809050"," weakness, even if it's just small, small pullback."
"15809050","15816840"," I bet if I bought three sets of 20 cents puts"
"15816840","15823680"," between now and the first week of January, I bet you there'll be big printers at some point. "
"15825040","15830880"," The odds will get in my favor and I will have only spent anywhere from 30 cents to 50 cents,"
"15831360","15832520"," maybe 60 cents."
"15835100","15839600"," My timing can be like throwing a hand grenade instead of having to hit a target."
"15842070","15843770"," Just buy programs still on. "
"15843930","15846610"," You guys seeing all this good chance of a gap up tomorrow."
"15846710","15848830"," This all points towards a gap up tomorrow."
"15849310","15850450"," We could gap up to 480. "
"15850890","15851330"," It's possible."
"15852010","15856930"," It's definitely on the table with the way that we're with the way that we're tracking into close"
"15856930","15857370"," here."
"15862700","15872680"," It wouldn't shock me to see a gap up to 480, but even so, even so, there's a there's good"
"15872680","15873520"," reason to. "
"15882270","15885050"," I mean, open up your charts on the spy, right?"
"15886090","15891350"," I want you to use some some some old school trader stuff."
"15893490","15903330"," We went from 451.14 on the cash market to 47733 into the bell right here."
"15903330","15913130"," So we went what almost not 200, but I don't know what that is 160 140 points or something 160"
"15913130","15922420"," points in the matter of 12345 relentless days of up"
"15922420","15928120"," just relentless buying all the way up. "
"15932590","15935850"," So if there was a time to hedge, we're getting there."
"15940870","15943970"," And everything points into this close that we're not right."
"15944090","15947550"," You see all these buyers 255,000. "
"15947650","15958060"," We're in a buy program, only 187,000 ripped to 4800 into after"
"15958060","15963780"," hours into even the open."
"15963780","15970480"," We could possibly open tomorrow 480 wind shock me either, but you're still at that cell point."
"15970480","15979360"," Okay, so we're in after hours, I'm going to check back on that chain. "
"15981060","15983400"," And 470s are now 23 cents."
"15988900","16016690"," I'm going to buy one less."
"16027510","16030850"," My program's still on even right now. "
"16041640","16043080"," Yeah, everybody's on board calls."
"16044940","16046540"," See what you guys are talking about."
"16059880","16061440"," Yeah, I can check Facebook real quick. "
"16062640","16063540"," No, it's not."
"16063540","16067940"," I'm just saying that you have relentless."
"16070220","16074440"," Relentless last five days think about that last five days just relentless. "
"16076260","16081080"," And that doesn't mean we don't gap up for tomorrow right doesn't mean you don't gap up take profit"
"16081080","16081960"," at the open bell tomorrow."
"16082100","16083160"," I see that happen."
"16083320","16085620"," It's not like it's not like that can't happen tomorrow. "
"16086020","16092740"," It's a question of taking your profits so that you secure you what's yours right."
"16093800","16095740"," Take your money, take your money and run."
"16099190","16105430"," Okay, so here's the plan for tomorrow you got 14 minutes left right 13 minutes left something like"
"16105430","16105690"," that. "
"16106490","16115850"," So here's the deal price target on the spy was 48 or for for excuse"
"16115850","16117110"," me."
"16122620","16127740"," So in Facebook you've got some sellers right here right this sets us up for selling down tomorrow."
"16128580","16132900"," Next wall is at 460 360 on on on Facebook. "
"16134040","16136120"," Next wall is 380 on Facebook."
"16137340","16139480"," And on the spy right here."
"16140460","16143200"," We're in a by program right to the end right. "
"16143880","16150320"," My points on Facebook as we were looking for four seven eight zero as a as a first price target"
"16150320","16152800"," second price target would be 480."
"16155180","16160640"," We wrote this thing up for five straight days we've made bank the entire way bank."
"16163570","16165350"," So do I need that last two bucks. "
"16166130","16166630"," I don't know."
"16169220","16171040"," So if you want to stay long into tomorrow."
"16172200","16174140"," Buy yourself a dirt cheap hedge. "
"16176560","16178820"," I wouldn't I wouldn't sell my lungs into Friday."
"16179040","16180360"," I think we're going back up on Friday."
"16180360","16190160"," I just think that as we get close to like 415 I think"
"16190160","16195060"," that like 470 P's expiring on December 29. "
"16195840","16201620"," You're going to be dirt cheap 20 cents 21 cents 20 cents."
"16202800","16208400"," I think that you buy those or you buy even cheaper the 460 P's are like what are those going"
"16208400","16212100"," for it now those are at three cents dirt cheap."
"16212860","16216240"," So you buy something really, really dirt cheap three cents. "
"16217340","16222160"," So you got let's you got 460 P's expiring the 29th at three cents right now."
"16222640","16227000"," So like right around four four four four team I'm going to look at the price of puts."
"16228300","16229800"," They have two days on them. "
"16230740","16236620"," You can stay long into the close but buy yourself some puts or you take profit because we're near"
"16236620","16240160"," our price target our intermediate price targets four 78."
"16240160","16245480"," I do think we go to 480 I do think we go to 483 possible it's on the table."
"16247260","16251620"," But do I think we do I think we gap up to 480 in the morning. "
"16252100","16254100"," It's maybe we're on a buy mode right now."
"16254640","16257360"," But I'd be I'd be holding on to some some protection here."
"16258060","16263080"," And a lot of you guys out there think about that where we are look at the charts. "
"16264280","16265280"," Put it on a month."
"16266340","16268440"," Take a look at the charts and think to yourself."
"16271420","16283380"," Look at where we are look at the move we just made you guys"
"16283380","16283580"," understand. "
"16287470","16292530"," Well that's my point is if we dip I'll buy that dip tomorrow for that run to 480."
"16293830","16297850"," If we don't dip and we go up to four 78 or 480 then I'm selling."
"16298730","16301610"," I'm selling the market there or I'm going to attempt to sell the market. "
"16303230","16305830"," So I'd be concerned as we are not concerned I would just."
"16307730","16309030"," This is where bears."
"16310210","16314450"," Tell me when like when we're down at four 48 and 450 this is where bears are telling me that"
"16314450","16315430"," they're buying four 25. "
"16315910","16321090"," But I'm like you guys are fucking crazy guys are fucking batshit crazy if you think we're doing"
"16321090","16321910"," that low right now."
"16322710","16325950"," So when when bears start entering or in bull start entering."
"16326610","16327510"," On the bell. "
"16328670","16329590"," At highs."
"16330170","16332850"," I think the same thing of them I think there's just as crazy."
"16339520","16342080"," They're cheap you just get them they're just insurance. "
"16342760","16346920"," And the other thing too would be I wouldn't even sell them I'd just hold them if you buy them"
"16346920","16349640"," at three cents four cents five cents."
"16351060","16356620"," I would just hold them I'd hold them till they die on on Wednesday because you could sell down but"
"16356620","16357860"," anytime between now Wednesday."
"16359620","16363000"," And all you need to do is sell them to some bear who thinks we're going to crash. "
"16364020","16365260"," And they'll they'll buy them from you."
"16367350","16369610"," And if they if they and this is the best part."
"16370010","16374990"," If they burn and don't if they burn let's say they're worthless and you're still long. "
"16375410","16376530"," You're still going to make bank."
"16378540","16382940"," You're still going to make bank so there's no there's no way to lose here."
"16388740","16389460"," And I'm a bull. "
"16390119","16392880"," So if you got a bull telling you to protect yourself here where we are."
"16396410","16397650"," I mean bears hate me."
"16398029","16400810"," I make fun of bears on Twitter all day long in my regular accounts. "
"16405550","16406849"," And I'm telling you to buy some puts."
"16414900","16416400"," Just in case here."
"16424970","16425470"," Yep. "
"16425590","16426509"," So you can gap up here."
"16426590","16428750"," It's not that we can't gap up to this four seven eight."
"16429450","16430369"," Four seven eight twenty. "
"16434290","16438770"," The concern is the shenanigans that take place in the overnight."
"16443500","16444500"," Okay guys ready."
"16446830","16450250"," I want you guys to look at my Twitter handle right now. "
"16452610","16453070"," Okay."
"16456180","16458520"," This is what I want you to look at on my Twitter handle."
"16458960","16463360"," I'm going to post something for you guys because some put hedges just got put on. "
"16464220","16464840"," After the bell."
"16470800","16473720"," We saw what happens when put hedges are put on right."
"16475119","16477279"," Talked we shot we saw it earlier today. "
"16478080","16479439"," I want you guys to look and see."
"16480040","16484860"," Because someone just bought four seventy seven puts or excuse me."
"16485200","16488080"," Someone just bought February February 18th. "
"16488660","16489320"," Twenty twenty two."
"16489860","16497140"," They spent five six eight nine million dollars on four fifty four P's."
"16498300","16499820"," At four oh seven. "
"16504550","16508110"," Look on my Twitter handle it's there on cat captains alpha."
"16508730","16512070"," You'll see hedges that just got slapped out at four oh seven PM."
"16513810","16517009"," Now does that give us our temporary weakness tomorrow. "
"16517430","16519509"," Does that give us our temporary weakness tomorrow."
"16525020","16527380"," Totally this shit always happens when you're not looking."
"16546189","16547590"," Desperate are you saw it. "
"16601360","16604560"," I love it."
"16604560","16606060"," That wasn't me."
"16606619","16609119"," Your wife's boyfriend burr. "
"16610020","16610779"," That's protection."
"16611619","16615939"," For example if we gap up tomorrow to four seventy eight something is that also time to buy puts."
"16616660","16618000"," Okay no so my price target. "
"16618480","16620840"," You have to understand we're still in this OPEC cycle."
"16621380","16623040"," We're at end of the year Christmas rally."
"16624939","16626919"," My expectation though is that. "
"16627919","16630040"," We should we should hit four eighty."
"16630759","16631480"," That's the expectation."
"16632259","16632700"," So. "
"16634020","16636840"," But my thought is that let's say we get some weakness in the overnight."
"16637259","16639000"," We trade down slightly into Tuesday."
"16639480","16642360"," And then you get the rest of the run into Friday. "
"16642700","16646980"," And then the next hedge comes on for JP Morgan at the end of the day or even morning or"
"16646980","16647740"," the end of the day on Friday."
"16647980","16649619"," And we saw down over the weekend."
"16650680","16651500"," For that hedge. "
"16651980","16652140"," So."
"16652980","16657540"," And that you saw what happened with the impact of the hedge earlier this afternoon right we had a"
"16657540","16658279"," hedge roll out."
"16658279","16661140"," And the market dipped a little bit. "
"16661619","16662480"," And then recovered."
"16663040","16667160"," We have another hedge that was just put on after hours at four oh seven PM."
"16667779","16674419"," So the implication in the illiquidity illiquidity in the overnight is that dealers might sell"
"16674419","16674840"," futures. "
"16680279","16681820"," So I guess my point would be."
"16683240","16686919"," Yeah I'm I'm open to four seventy eight when does it happen though."
"16687259","16690200"," I'm open to four eighty and four eighty three but when though. "
"16691419","16694480"," You know that doesn't mean you can't keep your spreads or keep your calls or whatever."
"16694880","16699160"," It just means that you should put some protection on if you're still very bullish heading in to"
"16699160","16700220"," every day of this week."
"16706450","16711029"," And I couldn't find a buy in on going long again today. "
"16711310","16716029"," I end up I sold all my longs today and then didn't find the right buy in for me to"
"16716029","16716669"," go long again."
"16716669","16722990"," So I bought puts on four seventy P for expiration on Wednesday."
"16724410","16726610"," So I'm in the bearish side of the train at this moment. "
"16740950","16744169"," So why don't you tell me your I'm going to log off here in just a few minutes."
"16744770","16748390"," Before I log off briefly in the text chat."
"16748810","16753330"," Tell me what you think we open at tomorrow cash market. "
"16753330","16755689"," At nine thirty."
"16767250","16777230"," You welcome Desperato heads currently"
"16777230","16778370"," burning like a barrel fire."
"16787810","16788290"," Yep. "
"16789430","16791110"," Yeah being cash is nice too."
"16791190","16792610"," No worries on either side of the trade."
"16795140","16797700"," Cash is probably the best positioning right now. "
"16801160","16803980"," Alex is already up on his on his hedge."
"16804220","16805700"," I think they're at twenty five cents now."
"16808240","16809540"," Another twenty five cents now. "
"16809580","16810540"," He's making a little bit of money."
"16814700","16815400"," Ben's flat."
"16815680","16816260"," Yeah, that makes sense. "
"16816480","16817860"," I like the flat position right now."
"16818660","16822260"," There's a lot of a lot of shenanigans can happen in this overnight for sure."
"16823320","16826000"," Gapped out a little like that's what I think. "
"16826320","16831320"," I think we get that small gap down and then we start we start running again into Friday or Thursday"
"16831320","16831660"," at least."
"16834080","16838240"," We've got a half Dan Friday right we we stopped trading on Friday at some point early."
"16838800","16841220"," I haven't looked to see what time we we close on Friday. "
"16841400","16842760"," I think we close it too."
"16845770","16848830"," Michael makes a good point for seventy five is VWAP."
"16851170","16854530"," Oh Matt Hoffman is is full on bear mode. "
"16855210","16857310"," The bears must be out and talking on Twitter."
"16862410","16866470"," My spy puts just got filled so I predict two twenty hilarious."
"16868420","16872080"," Four seven seven one six nice Chris gave exact targets. "
"16872840","16875420"," We opened down four seventy five would you buy right then and there."
"16875540","16876180"," Yes I would."
"16876820","16881780"," If we trade down tomorrow morning I'll have a video out for you tonight for what I'm looking for"
"16881780","16883680"," for support resistance levels. "
"16883680","16887300"," One thing you just need to know this information at this point right now for tomorrow."
"16888260","16894620"," Yeah I would expect either a gap up situation tomorrow or weakness to buy at some point tomorrow."
"16896580","16897940"," But again it's where we are. "
"16899880","16905860"," It's where we are in the market you have to consider that we just traded straight five straight"
"16905860","16906960"," days straight up to the moon."
"16907680","16913280"," And when you sometimes we will gap up on that last day we'll gap that giant that giant gap up."
"16914040","16918520"," Let's say we gapped up tomorrow I would buy against against the market again tomorrow. "
"16921720","16925560"," Maybe we maybe we'd sell sell down for that one day after gapping up."
"16926180","16929700"," But either way I couldn't find to reenter another long at the end of the day today."
"16930760","16935140"," And if I was and if I had entered along at the end of the day today I still would"
"16935140","16937540"," be putting some protection on those puts are dirt cheap. "
"16939020","16942500"," Those putt you got 460s that cost like three cents or something stupid."
"16943720","16945140"," Couldn't resist a buy like that."
"16950020","16951760"," They saw they saw your bare video. "
"16957500","16961520"," Alright guys I want you guys to have a great day I'll have a video out for you tomorrow."
"16962120","16965160"," I'm sure that it will be important to have a video for the open tomorrow."
"16965800","16967840"," I'll have a pose I might wait to make the video. "
"16967840","16975780"," I do want to see what the reaction is in the overnight because it is going to impact the trading"
"16975780","16976700"," plan for tomorrow."
"16977140","16979020"," It's 4 18 so you really can't trade this."
"16979560","16983400"," I'm assuming that if you're listening to me and you're you're a futures trader. "
"16983860","16987580"," I'm assuming I would be going full bear at some point tonight I'd be looking to short this shit"
"16987580","16989700"," into the ground if I was a futures trader."
"16991740","17001160"," I guarantee you'll see videos of futures traders that are salivating at the mouth to short down"
"17001160","17002820"," from 480 or 4 78."
"17003460","17004280"," One way or another. "
"17004700","17006880"," So they're going to be looking for those tags in the overnight."
"17007640","17008960"," Hopefully we get a little bit of weakness."
"17009780","17014340"," If you're a bull you really actually want to see some weakness in the overnight so that we can ride"
"17014340","17019680"," it from 4 75 let's say. "
"17019680","17026300"," If we rode it back from 4 75 you would it would be easier to see us going from 4"
"17026300","17027820"," 75 to 4 83."
"17028420","17034380"," Then it is seeing us go to 4 78 for 80 in the overnight and then trading to 500 or"
"17034380","17035180"," 9 490."
"17036500","17037420"," Does that make sense?"
"17037760","17038880"," Maybe that helps explain it better. "
"17040240","17041580"," Hey guys I'll have a great night."
"17042180","17043160"," Hope you guys made money."
"17043160","17048940"," I hope that some of you didn't lose money at least right or you're learning a better way to trade"
"17048940","17050980"," so you can start making money. "
"17051620","17055460"," These range trading these range bond trading scenarios have been really profitable."
"17057060","17059560"," Now you don't I wouldn't go be going full bear right away."
"17059680","17065240"," Same thing as you know you got to make sure you time that turn but also it's easy to to"
"17065240","17069680"," enter some of these trades for the eight pennies five cents three cents. "
"17070480","17075480"," And get your foot in the door in case we do reverse and start trading down the market."
"17076740","17080780"," Also remember that previous years are not representation of how this year will act."
"17081720","17087100"," So even if we get a Christmas rally it doesn't mean that it's going to match the same patterns of"
"17087100","17087980"," previous years. "
"17088460","17090300"," Just be conscious of that as we move forward."
"17091380","17096960"," It's probably a good time for you when you're trading to stay let or to put some blinders on"
"17096960","17098660"," listening to both bears and bulls."
"17099120","17101540"," Oftentimes I get the wrong signals. "
"17102140","17106680"," I see bears that enter too heavy too early and I see bulls that hold too long."
"17107200","17110200"," These are this is when the noise gets loud in social media."
"17110480","17116100"," So be careful of what you're what you're consuming out there for how bearish you should be and how"
"17116100","17117180"," bullish you should be. "
"17118420","17123820"," And listen to the things I said to you a few minutes ago about how you protect your lungs how"
"17123820","17129020"," you start to look for a turn in the market and then compare them to what some of the people"
"17129020","17131540"," in social media are saying to you out there."
"17131920","17137000"," Because I think that this is a more measured idea and plan moving forward than what you'll be"
"17137000","17137200"," hearing."
"17137420","17141180"," You're going to hear some bulls out there telling you fucking sorry for swearing fight. "
"17141180","17146240"," You know we're going to hit 5000 by January 31st and you're going to hear some bears out there"
"17146240","17148800"," telling you that will be hitting 430 in a week."
"17149920","17156300"," Okay so just timing is critical you're a trader and investor you need to time your trades."
"17157500","17164820"," You want to stay with the trend until you want to stay with the trend until it turns against you. "
"17164820","17171740"," And also things are cheap so what's cheap right now puts our dirt cheap right now."
"17172260","17173660"," Alright I'll see you guys tomorrow."
"17173920","17175080"," You all have a great night. "
"17176900","17177880"," Thank you for the tips."
"17178440","17182000"," Yeah if any of you guys are making money this is a free sub."
"17182280","17185960"," I don't require you to pay but if you are out there making money if you guys want to keep"
"17185960","17186820"," seeing me do this. "
"17187440","17189560"," It does make but I don't know why it makes me feel good."
"17189820","17191760"," I didn't think that it would but I'll be honest."
"17191760","17194380"," You guys tipping me if I give you guys good trades and stuff. "
"17194600","17196900"," You guys know I put the time into the research for this."
"17197040","17202640"," It does consume a lot of my time and I do share this information with you guys out there."
"17202820","17209340"," It does cost me a significant cost me somewhere between 12 and 15,000 a year to run this stuff"
"17209340","17216120"," on just the back end between the expensive internet and then all the software that I'm running. "
"17216120","17223660"," And then of course I got a live stream with you guys at critical pivots and sending out videos and"
"17223660","17225800"," then posting this stuff on a Twitter handle."
"17225940","17227160"," So I always appreciate that stuff."
"17227380","17231040"," I didn't expect that I would but I got to be honest with you I do appreciate the tips. "
"17231380","17236680"," It does make a difference and it keeps me motivated to keep helping you guys out as we move"
"17236680","17237020"," forward."
"17237340","17241480"," And eventually I will have a nice series of classes out there."
"17241480","17242900"," Those will all be free as well. "
"17243320","17247180"," You're going to see more content be provided."
"17248980","17252680"," And hopefully this gets you into set up to trade right so."
"17254820","17256520"," And I want to keep doing this for you guys. "
"17256740","17261520"," Hopefully we can we have a difficult to navigate market coming our way."
"17263060","17268300"," And a lot of the pump or type YouTube channels are not going to cut it in this environment as"
"17268300","17269720"," we move forward in 2022."
"17269720","17275760"," So you really want to be following real traders real investors out there that have traded prior to"
