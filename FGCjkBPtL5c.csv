"17560","22580"," It's almost like you forget how to do this stuff for a week and you're like, what do I do"
"22580","22800"," here?"
"23780","25280"," How do I produce my own show?"
"32740","36020"," Join our research and send me."
"50900","51940"," Check one too!"
"66260","67980"," So you got going on here."
"68080","69000"," Good morning, everybody. "
"70680","75480"," Hope you all had a wonderful holiday."
"78550","79710"," Sort by newest."
"80950","81710"," Good morning. "
"82470","84410"," Hope you all had a great holiday out there."
"86290","87690"," Welcome back up here."
"88170","88750"," Members only. "
"90730","91170"," Save."
"94410","95610"," Look at this right here."
"98470","99090"," Good morning. "
"99350","100250"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"101190","101850"," Ted Deli?"
"102530","102950"," Ted Deli?"
"103070","104390"," Thank you for subscribing."
"105010","105650"," Appreciate it, brother."
"105830","106210"," We're going to member. "
"112010","114730"," Let's go right into the stream here on the opening bell."
"114850","116130"," I'll be trying to be quick with you here."
"116570","119210"," Hopefully you sold yesterday. "
"120350","122030"," So I did make a post."
"122370","124770"," I made the rounds, I think, on social media."
"125970","126770"," I went over to Reddit. "
"127729","132110"," Then late night, I think, on the third and said, now you probably have one more gap up and then"
"132110","133690"," we'll sell the fifth."
"135190","137410"," Hopefully, I think I put that on Twitter at some point."
"137550","139010"," I hope you sold the fifth as well. "
"140030","144710"," I think I even said sell it into likely middle of the month."
"145190","146430"," I think it even gave some dates."
"147510","149130"," And there's likely two cells in there. "
"149410","154930"," I should have wrote that, but there's likely two cell signals, or hold on a second here."
"155610","156750"," We put this on Twitter too."
"159790","164670"," We'll get back to vacation here in just a minute, but just for this opening bell, there's a few"
"164670","165930"," things to look at here too. "
"166070","171070"," If you're wondering if we gap up on the opening bell, probably not."
"172450","173550"," We have a little bit."
"173730","174730"," We have some stuff to fill. "
"174990","178550"," I'll show you that here."
"178870","179930"," I'm just a moment here."
"182550","183670"," I'm a little late here. "
"184210","185270"," I came back, right?"
"185510","186970"," I got all kinds of fun stuff to fill you."
"187770","188950"," We got a lot to talk about."
"191290","196730"," So when you get back from these vacations, man, it's like everything is going to take longer than"
"196730","197510"," you expect, right?"
"199390","200370"," Okay, so there we go. "
"200610","202330"," I just posted a link to the live stream."
"203130","208970"," So just start with the market itself."
"210130","211890"," Let's look where real demand is. "
"212450","213950"," So we've got some hang tight one second here."
"219600","226640"," So just off the bell here, there's a little bit of demand right on the bell this morning, next"
"226640","227280"," minute or so."
"227600","228920"," So you might get a quick gap up here. "
"229860","233340"," But there isn't really, let's look back in time here."
"235640","237120"," Let's sneak that in right there."
"238420","245600"," It's kind of, you know, when you're moving up like this, this is six o'clock in the morning right"
"245600","246160"," where we are. "
"246860","248580"," So here my cursor is right here."
"248860","253560"," This is, there should be some support here, believe it or not."
"253720","255160"," But this is all garbage down here. "
"256000","256899"," This is all fake."
"257579","263520"," When I talk about returning to the scene of the crime, when we sell off like this, same thing going"
"263520","263800"," up."
"264100","271060"," You don't want to see like a bunch of these moves that take place in low liquidity environments. "
"271680","273760"," They get, they get erased eventually."
"273960","278580"," Normally they get erased quicker than you can leave gaps behind, but stuff like this that happens,"
"279080","282220"," you know, stuff like this right here, it's kind of suspect."
"283680","289060"," So there is though, this is right at, this is the, this tag right here is at six a.m."
"289820","291740"," back on the 30th. "
"291960","300100"," So it's a little bit stronger right here, but even so, like we have some stuff to close down here."
"300100","306760"," So if you want to like get out of your short or whatever your puts you can, we're close to"
"306760","316160"," some kind of a, close to some kind of a, I don't know what you guys like to call it."
"316300","317920"," Like we'll catch a bounce here shortly. "
"317920","321600"," So I'll show you why we're going to catch a bounce and then we're going to get a second leg"
"321600","324480"," down, hopefully, into the middle of July."
"324920","325260"," We need one."
"325460","327640"," So we need to cool off a little bit. "
"327640","328800"," We need a correction."
"329340","330980"," We got a bunch of stuff to go over this morning."
"331220","334340"," So we do have the gap, the big gap down here. "
"334460","335520"," I'd like to see that get closed."
"336780","340660"," We also have the daily trigger that's racing up in the background."
"341420","344540"," That's right now trading for 33, 10. "
"345400","346680"," So you've got one more."
"346820","353260"," It'd be really nice to see like the gap get close, then come back up and then hit that daily"
"353260","356080"," trigger in about two or three days at four thirty five."
"356720","358320"," Right now it's at four thirty three. "
"358440","361640"," So if it was at four thirty five and make a nice place to actually bounce."
"363040","366540"," If we can do that, I don't know, but we'll talk about that."
"367260","369460"," So I'd like to see at least that to start. "
"371320","375500"," And then catch a bounce and then catch a big bounce and maybe even go down and catch the weekly"
"375500","377860"," if we can for July."
"379600","380580"," It's a good morning to all of you."
"380680","381340"," Hopefully you sold this. "
"382560","386020"," I said it's possible one more gap up before we roll over on the fifth."
"386480","389480"," We got the one last gap up, but it wasn't like a new high or anything."
"390040","395480"," That failure should have given you some information as to expect to sell the fifth. "
"396700","397740"," Hopefully you're in a trade."
"398060","400960"," If you were trading, hopefully you're in a trade to sell the fifth."
"400960","403280"," I saw Miro come out and he said the same thing. "
"403740","407500"," He said he was going to sell the fifth as well or he was ready to sell the fifth."
"408080","409800"," I think everybody else was too."
"410800","413480"," Now we'll rebalance this entire move. "
"414400","419840"," We'll take the window dressing trade for the quarter and then you're probably looking for a nice"
"419840","421340"," dip to buy."
"421340","430620"," What's fascinating here is I have not paid much attention to the market, to social media."
"431500","438380"," And I mean in terms of the big data that comes out, the big smart guys out there talking all"
"438380","438920"," that kind of stuff. "
"439540","441860"," I haven't paid any attention to them."
"442340","446800"," And you can kind of foresee this stuff without paying attention to them."
"446800","448720"," And that's a big thing. "
"449300","452700"," The trigger is telling me you got to do this and you got to do that and we're going to"
"452700","453300"," come back to this."
"453920","455260"," We're going to do this and we're going to do that."
"455600","457560"," So I find that fascinating. "
"458280","459840"," I found that fascinating."
"460760","463740"," Over this past week, it was pretty clear as day."
"464200","473320"," And I'm wondering how much of an effect paying attention to some of the news and some of the social"
"473320","476640"," media and all that stuff really does cloud your judgment. "
"476640","480000"," As a trader or an investor."
"480680","483120"," So is it really clouded for you?"
"483200","483680"," Does it not?"
"485080","489880"," Is it like a lot of swaying of opinion when there shouldn't be?"
"490820","494220"," Are you actually selling when you should be?"
"496060","500320"," You know, you have people say I lost half a million dollars trying to short this market."
"500540","503600"," It's pretty easy to see that we should have sold. "
"503600","506480"," Hold on a second here."
"508380","510080"," Can you guys hear me?"
"513080","514559"," Shit, you guys wind up able to hear me."
"518039","522400"," I've got a you can't hear me. "
"522400","522900"," Okay, cool, cool."
"524200","529700"," I was hearing some other noise in the background and I had some of my sound board wasn't routed."
"530800","532140"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"532580","534000"," Keep on gapping it down."
"534100","535480"," Close that gap down there, big boy."
"536640","538440"," Close that gap down there. "
"543290","548070"," So the idea here is are you selling when you should be selling?"
"548090","549990"," Are you buying when you should be buying?"
"550790","551950"," Are you sitting in your hands?"
"552130","553090"," Did you be sitting in your hands?"
"555390","557810"," And we live stream here right live stream Monday through Friday."
"557810","559270"," We're here eight hours a day."
"559690","565890"," I know there are guys out there that come on and off the air at pivots where they trade part"
"565890","567570"," of the day and they're like, I'm out of here. "
"567650","569830"," I made a money got like rapid or up the show."
"570130","573970"," But you guys are also like a lot of people have different jobs or you have a commitment."
"573970","581330"," So you have children or you have a trucker at nighttime and this is the only time between this time"
"581330","583490"," and this time to trade the market or check in on the market. "
"583490","590090"," So I know that that part of what"
"590090","596130"," we do here is different than a lot of other places."
"598530","600550"," There we go."
"600790","607070"," I'm going to get that sexy voice out for you. "
"610130","612870"," I'm going to get some things I'm going to do in the background here."
"612870","618160"," Yeah, it's going to be back man."
"618360","618520"," Definitely. "
"619000","619660"," Good morning."
"619840","620440"," He he gave."
"620640","621080"," How are you doing?"
"624440","625320"," Morning Jill. "
"625440","625760"," The toll."
"626000","627380"," Happy Fourth of July to you."
"627520","628440"," Johnny moves out there. "
"629100","629980"," Red on right on."
"633660","636260"," Is red line a glitch for selling?"
"637080","637520"," No."
"639140","639660"," What's red?"
"639880","641020"," I mean this red line right here. "
"641760","643260"," That's just a volume bar down there."
"647550","648650"," Turn this on for you."
"652880","654740"," Yeah, there should be no glitch for selling. "
"654740","657740"," You should all be aware that you should have sold the 5th."
"658120","659440"," I think I made that clear."
"659660","661640"," Even when it's like, it's in Wall Street, that's on. "
"661780","665420"," I think the third or something like one in the morning."
"666280","669000"," I was like, you should I was like, you're going to get one more gap and then we're going to"
"669000","669800"," sell the 5th."
"670720","672260"," Likely in two middle of the month. "
"672940","673760"," Wait a minute."
"674900","677440"," It's got two versions of this plan right there."
"690470","697790"," Our early triggers up at 442.05. We've got the bunch of stuff down here. "
"698770","700730"," A bunch of planes down below."
"701070","702190"," I doubt we can get down there."
"702450","704010"," I'd like to see us close the gap bounce. "
"704810","705930"," Reject off the early trigger."
"705930","711330"," Come back down here and hit the daily trigger at 435 at some point later in the week."
"713510","715690"," And I'd really like to get down to the weekly trigger. "
"716650","717790"," We'll take a look at that."
"717930","719110"," We're going to take a look at a bunch of stuff this morning."
"721690","725010"," Maybe you think that maybe some of you guys probably think we're crashing too. "
"726150","727090"," I can never tell."
"729530","730770"," We're going to look at some stuff here."
"755080","759360"," It's a 30 minute chart on the spy. "
"760060","765220"," We're going to take a walk around real quick and we're going to get ES the spy and SPX."
"766000","768080"," It's kind of cool things to see here, right?"
"768820","770600"," We've got the daily trigger racing up."
"770980","776980"," It's trying to cool off a little bit and actually like to see the daily trigger cool off a lot. "
"777720","782980"," If we can get a correction out of this would be the best under estimating inflation."
"783160","784860"," Didn't blunt the impact of me."
"784920","789660"," Just because I don't really care about the news anymore. "
"791040","792860"," I think it's bullshit."
"794340","796900"," But we also have the hourly, which is been important, right?"
"797820","804000"," Whenever we come into the bottoming process in the hourly, I always want to see that, right?"
"804000","814220"," If you look at this hourly here, you could just see the higher lows here, right?"
"815710","818860"," We start to make a rounding of the corner here."
"819640","825600"," As the hourly cools off down here, we'll be looking for that same kind of a scenario, right?"
"826760","828120"," Maybe we catch a bounce in here. "
"830700","834920"," Then we head back down, hopefully, and take out the weekly."
"835160","837940"," I'd really like to see that if that's possible in here."
"838120","839960"," If you can see that right there. "
"842040","845500"," I'm sure people are calling this a double top and then we're going to crash the market and all that"
"845500","845900"," kind of stuff."
"846900","852500"," The spy, though, at least, now we're going to look at SPX and we're going to see where SPX is."
"852500","858680"," I always like to see SPX for cash market. "
"859560","861100"," It's kind of an important thing here, right?"
"861660","867120"," You break below the hourly trigger and you begin to sell off of it, right?"
"867900","871660"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"872800","875280"," I have the daily trigger coming up here."
"876560","879200"," This is what, maybe the 13th or 14th. "
"879200","882440"," Catch one more buy and then bam, we sell below it."
"883000","886300"," That'd be the preferred thing to happen for me, at least."
"886960","888860"," I'd like to see a corrective move here. "
"889900","893380"," We normally get through about three a year."
"894080","899880"," We have not been checking the daily a ton, right?"
"900740","906260"," We barely got close to the daily back on the 26th."
"907700","914220"," We did tag it back here in May, but every three months or so, I'm kind of looking for that"
"914220","915960"," one nice corrective move. "
"916440","926500"," Right now, it's sitting at 41.75, so if we could hit 4200 or even possibly 42.50, it"
"926500","926960"," would be nice."
"927900","933000"," In the middle of July, they make a giant move higher for the quarter."
"935080","936520"," We'll get ES really quick. "
"939060","940460"," Wrong one, that's ever source."
"942660","944800"," I was wondering if people just trade ever source."
"950930","954310"," We have price above the green line, price below the green line. "
"954830","960930"," We got underneath the green line two confirmation moves, bam, started selling it down."
"961530","966690"," Price target below somewhere around 4,400 on ES."
"984420","986400"," I'm going to read some of this chat very real quick. "
"986680","992420"," I get some weirdness going on with my more weirdness."
"992780","996040"," Every time I leave, it's like everything resets itself."
"998700","1001420"," I had my wife turned off. "
"1001860","1003220"," I've got a bunch of lights back here."
"1003220","1006380"," My wife manually turned them all off."
"1006520","1007720"," I've got remotes for everything. "
"1008200","1010440"," I'm like, why the fuck are my lights not coming on?"
"1011220","1013380"," I'm like, every time I leave, something weird happens."
"1015020","1015800"," I'm all upset."
"1016160","1018160"," I'm walking around looking for batteries from my remotes. "
"1019440","1022800"," My wife is like, I'm doing a group of batteries available."
"1023160","1024740"," She's like, oh, we took them all with us."
"1025880","1026760"," It's making awesome. "
"1026960","1027160"," I'm like, okay."
"1027960","1029859"," I dig out some of these batteries."
"1030819","1033440"," Then I'm plugging them in and she's helping me. "
"1033599","1034440"," She goes, oh, no, honey."
"1034560","1035839"," I turned off the lights for you."
"1036220","1037420"," I go, what do you mean?"
"1037599","1039900"," She goes, I switched them all off one at a time. "
"1041780","1045900"," What do I say about potential?"
"1046560","1046980"," Good question."
"1048960","1054300"," Tony Cheese is asking, what do you say about a potential intraday dip buy around noon?"
"1055180","1056200"," I don't like it."
"1056960","1061720"," I like the idea of selling off of any dip buys. "
"1062140","1063340"," I think that you're selling here."
"1064180","1065680"," I think we're in sell mode."
"1066340","1071400"," I think any bounce is only another opportunity to sell. "
"1073420","1077680"," From now into, it doesn't have to happen into the 19th."
"1077680","1079200"," I think I wrote the 19th 21st."
"1079700","1081560"," It doesn't have to happen until then. "
"1081560","1088200"," I think it's a more prudent to jump on the sell train."
"1089100","1090960"," I think we're in sell mode."
"1091100","1096820"," I think we're in correction mode until two prove improvement otherwise if we recover the hourly"
"1096820","1098880"," trigger right now. "
"1099260","1105840"," I think three weeks ago I looked back on bull runs and I checked all of them."
"1107000","1109220"," All of them checked every single one of them."
"1109860","1115740"," I checked them to find out number one how long they last on average. "
"1116400","1117600"," We have a stabilized market."
"1118280","1122640"," Turns into a bull run like the bell curve."
"1123740","1127400"," Not many of them last six to nine months. "
"1128360","1132400"," We start to see bull runs under after about a year."
"1133960","1137000"," The big part of the bell curve is two, three years."
"1138320","1141460"," Then the long part of the bell curve is like five to six. "
"1142200","1144300"," Seven and out wires eight, stuff like that."
"1145560","1155300"," But even so, in those bell curves, there's one thing that is consistent in all of them."
"1157060","1167360"," That would be that we tagged the daily trigger multiple times in the year, 15, 16, 17,"
"1167580","1168100"," 18, 20. "
"1169580","1171800"," And at least fucking three times a year."
"1172600","1174400"," We correct down to the weekly."
"1175040","1178340"," It is just like 2022. "
"1180300","1184120"," If you don't know this already, we haven't had one."
"1185600","1195340"," If we technically became a stabilized bull run in March, we're now in July, we need one."
"1196040","1198940"," This is likely it. "
"1199620","1201720"," There's a high probability of this being one of them."
"1202380","1206340"," It's not guaranteed, but there's a high probability of it."
"1206520","1212020"," For right now, until approved otherwise, you're not looking to buy any dips here. "
"1212120","1216680"," You're looking to actually, you're actually looking to sell a rip."
"1218560","1219680"," I'm going to tell you that too."
"1219920","1221600"," I'm going to be crystal clear with you. "
"1222480","1223900"," You're looking to sell a rip."
"1224140","1225340"," Unless, unless approved and otherwise."
"1225800","1234700"," So if you're a bull out there, the, if you're a bull out there, we're at 441.95. Yeah. "
"1234880","1238340"," So if you're a bull out there, I'm going to show you this right now."
"1238480","1238600"," Okay."
"1242020","1242840"," Let me try there. "
"1243040","1244160"," I'm going to do this big thing here."
"1244160","1246240"," Oh, I can't do this."
"1246340","1246720"," There we go. "
"1247600","1250200"," So if you're a bull out here, here's your hourly trigger."
"1251260","1259140"," What you need to do to be buying dips right now for you, you need to be seeing like the"
"1259140","1259800"," bounce, right?"
"1259960","1260860"," The clearing of the gap."
"1261600","1262700"," We cleared most of it here. "
"1263740","1269580"," You need to be seeing like all of this here before and then a recheck, double recheck."
"1270240","1275600"," And then we start going higher before I would, before I'd even recommend here."
"1278500","1280280"," You want to see all this here, right?"
"1280480","1281740"," You want to see all this stuff here?"
"1284740","1287840"," And I would say buy that dip right there. "
"1289720","1291840"," There are inter-day trades here."
"1293100","1295040"," It's kind of a shitty white line, isn't it?"
"1295340","1296000"," Should be more like this."
"1298160","1300800"," There are some day trades you could possibly do in here. "
"1300920","1301840"," You can trade this maybe."
"1301840","1303020"," You can trade this possibly."
"1303520","1305640"," I don't think this is happening at the moment. "
"1305840","1307400"," Maybe it is, but I don't think that it is."
"1307740","1312020"," I think it's more, I think it's more of from this point forward."
"1312360","1317480"," Every time I come up to this hourly trigger, you're looking for an entry to a short market. "
"1317900","1318280"," That's what I think."
"1319280","1320260"," Could be wrong in this."
"1325360","1326840"," Sell the ripbears everywhere. "
"1327240","1328560"," Just had instant tens in their pants."
"1332880","1334820"," That's what I think this is."
"1335180","1337660"," And we should get it's normal. "
"1338080","1343120"," So in every one of these bull markets, it is normal for us to have a corrective move."
"1343900","1346200"," And I'll foretell something else too."
"1346860","1353640"," If we do this correction, you're likely going to have a bunch of sellers at that bottom saying,"
"1354220","1354820"," we're going to crash. "
"1355780","1358400"," Hair on fire, running around screaming on social media."
"1359180","1365300"," That's probably the time for you as a buyer to step in and take the market long, very long."
"1366980","1368120"," Now I could be wrong here. "
"1368260","1373060"," Now if I'm wrong here, and we trade above it, you have a nice gap up here to fill now."
"1373320","1374520"," So this gap is mostly gone."
"1375680","1376900"," There's a little tiny bit of it left. "
"1377740","1379300"," A small little gap right here."
"1380820","1382840"," I'll leave just this little bit down here."
"1383400","1385020"," And there is a bunch of gap to sell up here. "
"1385800","1386580"," Fill up here."
"1386740","1388940"," There's a giant gap here to here."
"1389580","1391160"," So we can trade all the way up here. "
"1391400","1392040"," Not against it."
"1392800","1398760"," My own personal preference right now is selling this market down a little bit, cooling it off a"
"1398760","1399080"," little bit."
"1400700","1403740"," So there's another gap right here if you can't see it at home. "
"1412600","1414260"," Let me see what you guys are saying here."
"1415180","1416600"," It's some real wonkiness going on."
"1417180","1420400"," Like all my streamlabs is like really small. "
"1425240","1426740"," Yeah, I don't care about 10-year."
"1426980","1428100"," 10-year is being shit to me."
"1428600","1429920"," Two's and 10's being nothing to me. "
"1430820","1434000"," The only thing that matters to me, I want to be clear with you guys out there."
"1434740","1437320"," There's only, it's a really weird thing."
"1438180","1440060"," I did see some of that over the weekend. "
"1441520","1444300"," There's some real fascinating stuff at Play here."
"1445020","1453080"," If you, I like to look back on history and I like to see the interplay between the Fed Fund's"
"1453080","1463360"," rate, the unemployment rate, the jobs rate, the rate of inflation, and"
"1463360","1464940"," also the two's and 10's."
"1465400","1467580"," So I think it's the whole package, right?"
"1468360","1469980"," There's one fascinating thing here. "
"1470380","1472300"," I'm going to show you this with my cursor, okay?"
"1473540","1476940"," It's a fascinating interplay too because it's like a symphony."
"1477260","1484100"," It's like all these things need to be firing at the same time for that market crash you're looking"
"1484100","1484480"," for."
"1485520","1487280"," And we know a few things here. "
"1487340","1488480"," There's a few things we can glean."
"1489500","1496900"," So if this is inflation, okay, and we're like peeking on inflation, and we actually do start to"
"1496900","1497360"," come down."
"1497620","1498900"," And let's say this is where we should be. "
"1500880","1507360"," As long as it's coming down fast, the market at some point in here is going to begin to go"
"1507360","1507560"," up."
"1508720","1514180"," And you're going to have moments where the market will roll over, both spikes and inflation as it's"
"1514180","1514640"," coming down."
"1515820","1521700"," But you're really truly never in risk of crashing somewhere in here. "
"1524240","1526900"," There's like this golden pocket in here."
"1527960","1536160"," And as long as this is happening, this part of inflation coming down, the stock market will rise"
"1536160","1538140"," like every single time."
"1539080","1546120"," There's another fascinating thing about this is there's usually a golden pocket in here as well"
"1546120","1551120"," with unemployment and job demand. "
"1551120","1559440"," And this weekend I was looking at the idea behind job demand."
"1561300","1567960"," And in this pocket in here, you don't really short that stuff."
"1568120","1571740"," And they're usually still raising rates in here, pausing, raising, that kind of stuff. "
"1573260","1575400"," So you've got rates still being increased."
"1576460","1578300"," You've got inflation falling fast."
"1578980","1582440"," You've got decent unemployment rates. "
"1582620","1585340"," It's starting to rise, but it's still not quite there."
"1585920","1591760"," And the other magic part of this sauce is that you still have jobs like demand for people to get"
"1591760","1592320"," to work."
"1592820","1594400"," And you still have people working. "
"1595060","1597640"," I don't care if they're working fucking 100 hours a week."
"1598180","1598820"," They're working."
"1599580","1600580"," They're making money. "
"1600840","1601560"," They're paying their bills."
"1601900","1603040"," Yeah, they might be taking on debt."
"1603280","1605100"," Yeah, they might be partying like it's 1999. "
"1607020","1614820"," But as long as that secret sauce is going, it's hard to look at the inverted yield curve and say,"
"1615040","1615460"," oh, we're fucked."
"1616340","1617820"," Because there are many examples."
"1618500","1621000"," There's about 30 to 40% of the time. "
"1621120","1626260"," There's a lot of examples where twos and tens do not equal a stock market crash."
"1627280","1633280"," And when they did equal a stock market crash, the rest of the secret sauce was there."
"1634320","1637860"," Even when it's front-ran, it's right there. "
"1638120","1643540"," It's like you literally have the end of rates, rate cuts, if not cutting."
"1644420","1646260"," You have the bottoming of inflation."
"1647660","1650980"," Everybody's like, we've got 99 cent eggs again, all that kind of stuff. "
"1651760","1654120"," And we're actually getting big rug pulls."
"1654400","1658020"," You start to see big companies going bankrupt."
"1658860","1663220"," You start to see small and mid-side cut-sized companies going bankrupt. "
"1663600","1665140"," And I touched on this once recently."
"1665320","1668560"," Somebody caught onto it recently on Twitter."
"1668800","1670060"," I finally started talking about it on Twitter. "
"1670160","1672300"," I'm talking to you guys about this for a long time."
"1672400","1679000"," And that is we've created a mutated, we've retarded the business cycle."
"1680440","1683860"," So you put the brakes, then you get air brakes, right?"
"1684080","1686020"," Then you get another set of brakes, right?"
"1686220","1686880"," Like an engine, right?"
"1688320","1691320"," And we've got this big 18-wheeler truck we're driving. "
"1691320","1693440"," And normally everything's running together."
"1694100","1695840"," And we don't have that right now."
"1695980","1700960"," We have like a second business cycle that no one wanted to address. "
"1701800","1705840"," We've got this like, I mean, we know this, right?"
"1708360","1712120"," Historically, when was the last time we ever shut our economy down?"
"1712820","1716680"," And then literally pumped money into our economy."
"1717660","1721960"," And I do see some people out there that get pissed off and they're like, yeah, all those people"
"1721960","1724660"," that took PPP and all these people that took this and took that."
"1724940","1727180"," I'm shocked and offended. "
"1728140","1728760"," I am."
"1728860","1729640"," I'm offended, right?"
"1730160","1733480"," I know that there are people that shouldn't have taken some of that PPP money."
"1734040","1741140"," But I remember I was in the market and they had these things called Main Street Loans, right?"
"1741660","1743800"," And I remember Jerome Powell sitting in front of the Senate. "
"1743800","1748600"," And he was like, he was like, here's the deal."
"1748760","1752440"," The Senate was like, okay, we're going to do Main Street Loans."
"1753300","1754380"," And we're going to do PPP. "
"1756120","1760940"," The Main Street Loans, the largest companies in this country took."
"1761920","1764560"," These are basically free money loans, right?"
"1765660","1768020"," Cheap, cheap loans for big money."
"1770260","1775820"," And Jerome was in a Senate hearing and he said, the senators were like, why don't you give these"
"1775820","1777300"," loans to Main Street?"
"1778780","1781400"," And mid-sized businesses and small businesses. "
"1782520","1784380"," And that's who we're directing this at."
"1784600","1786160"," And Jerome was very intelligent."
"1787320","1792640"," He said, if we do that, see, see, told you not to buy goddamn calls. "
"1795160","1797400"," I just said, goddamn, I shouldn't have said that."
"1803300","1804280"," We're selling."
"1804780","1806060"," Remember that, selling. "
"1809160","1811760"," So Jerome sat in the hearing being grilled."
"1813060","1816480"," These fucking monsters, these senators are monsters."
"1817420","1817780"," They're evil. "
"1819040","1827360"," They were setting up Main Street, USA to fail by taking these loans."
"1828060","1830740"," And your only sick, the guy that was on your side."
"1831900","1837460"," You know how, well, Winky says, Jim Kramer is probably the only guy on your side as a retailer. "
"1838060","1840820"," But even if he's polluted, he's probably the guy."
"1841020","1847600"," Jerome Powell literally was on your side out there as the little person during COVID."
"1848820","1851700"," Because he was like, he's, he blank told him. "
"1852000","1856560"," He said, if you give these people these loans, they are never paying them back."
"1857960","1864720"," You're going to exacerbate and blow up our economy one way or another doing this."
"1865320","1868200"," You're going to put all these businesses on the hook, small businesses. "
"1868860","1873600"," You're going to put medium size of small businesses on the hook for so many billions of dollars."
"1874100","1875320"," They're never going to pay it back."
"1875320","1878240"," They're going to declare bankruptcy and reform a new company. "
"1878620","1879740"," It's exactly what have happened."
"1880400","1884680"," So he demanded less restrictions on PPP loans."
"1885080","1889380"," It's fascinating because you're going after PPP loans out there. "
"1889680","1890860"," That's the noise, right?"
"1891080","1892520"," That's out in social media in the news."
"1893140","1895560"," You know, fraud in the lot, biggest, largest fraud ever."
"1896700","1898160"," I'm like, wait a minute here. "
"1898620","1899760"," You shut down our country."
"1900440","1901540"," You shut it down."
"1901680","1902800"," You force people to stay home. "
"1903500","1904520"," That is the reality."
"1905400","1910160"," You have to keep these people, the wheels turning."
"1910780","1911640"," You got to keep them turning. "
"1912120","1914360"," If you don't, you're going to collapse our nation."
"1914820","1918160"," If you're a person out there who wants to see our nation collapsed, get fucked."
"1919120","1924640"," If you're a person that wants to put these small and medium businesses on the hook during something"
"1924640","1926280"," that's not there doing, right?"
"1926440","1927300"," They didn't shut the country down. "
"1927660","1928680"," The government did, right?"
"1929620","1930980"," Because you want to fuck them too?"
"1931200","1931880"," Well, get fucked too."
"1931880","1934760"," You want to see our economy be burning tires in New York?"
"1935040","1935560"," Get out of here."
"1935680","1935940"," Get fucked. "
"1936140","1936500"," It looks serious."
"1936540","1937240"," I'm going to take it fucked."
"1937840","1940200"," So what happens though is that this is the facts. "
"1940880","1942080"," They shut our country down."
"1942900","1944160"," They gave PPP."
"1944940","1946780"," Then they fed you a bold garbage. "
"1948420","1954120"," I'm talking about like politicians, news media, social media, people with agendas, outside"
"1954120","1954780"," countries."
"1955380","1959980"," Then fed you more bullshit and didn't tell you that that we created another business cycle."
"1959980","1961100"," That's what they did. "
"1961560","1963600"," They created another business cycle."
"1964580","1970580"," They told you that these people were out buying cars and partying in Vegas and I don't know."
"1971740","1975160"," When all the shit they were saying that people were doing, some people were doing that. "
"1975800","1977340"," But other people took care of themselves."
"1977780","1979760"," They took care of their school loans."
"1980200","1981940"," They took care of their business loans. "
"1982700","1983580"," They took care of their mortgage."
"1984100","1987500"," It was the first time in their life where they're breaking their dicks day in and day out."
"1987500","1989120"," They got some money. "
"1989960","1991340"," Some of them did the right thing."
"1992560","1996560"," They created like a secondary business cycle."
"1996700","1997860"," It's bizarre to see. "
"1998660","2001240"," All along, we're doing all of that."
"2002000","2005400"," You have companies out there that took the loans, the Main Street loans."
"2005660","2006660"," They took the PPP too. "
"2007660","2008780"," Then maybe they had a bad product."
"2009860","2013040"," Some we can see that some are just like the three headed goofy dragon."
"2013280","2015600"," You see like Peloton out there. "
"2015600","2016380"," Didn't make a bike."
"2017100","2018620"," But some companies didn't."
"2019360","2023940"," You can look at some of the companies that we look at and if you look at any of the"
"2023940","2030040"," companies that I talk about on this show, you can check their year over year profits. "
"2030560","2034880"," You can check their sales year over year or sales year over year, their revs year over year."
"2035360","2041280"," You can check that they actually produce a product like we're not promising something."
"2042560","2043920"," We got something. "
"2045280","2049199"," You can also see that their guidances are excellent."
"2050100","2051960"," They've got like every guidance is great."
"2052340","2052760"," Now they're stuck. "
"2053100","2057380"," Their price of their stock went to the moon during COVID."
"2058139","2060440"," They got repriced all the way down here."
"2062280","2066080"," And in this time frame, they're doing the same thing they said they were going to do. "
"2066719","2068639"," Nothing has changed for these companies."
"2069550","2071199"," And they're bouncing right now."
"2071920","2073960"," They're getting a relief rally right now. "
"2074380","2078880"," What you're seeing right now is a secondary business cycle."
"2079520","2080260"," That's what you're seeing."
"2080440","2085380"," You're seeing the main cycle that took place that needed to come off. "
"2086380","2089400"," And then you're seeing a secondary business cycle."
"2090280","2092260"," Take place in our country right now."
"2093880","2100820"," A lot of these companies and a lot of these people were given an unnatural second chance. "
"2101680","2106460"," When I say that, when I say that this is unusual, it's because normally they go through these"
"2106460","2109200"," cycles, you don't get a reprieve."
"2109480","2113880"," You don't get an opportunity, a second shot or a chance."
"2114600","2116040"," And they don't do it for everybody. "
"2116560","2117680"," They did it for everybody."
"2117680","2124140"," This was the one time historically in our country where almost every citizen, if you had a business"
"2124140","2127060"," of any kind, you were given a second chance."
"2129120","2129480"," Fascinating. "
"2129780","2130440"," Do I agree with it?"
"2130620","2131000"," I don't know."
"2131280","2132220"," Do I think it was right or wrong?"
"2132320","2132640"," I don't know."
"2132800","2133320"," I know one thing. "
"2133780","2137700"," I know for, and you guys go after people, people, but I got to say one thing."
"2138240","2142460"," You're trying to tell me what we're going to have COVID and then you just let these people get"
"2142460","2145060"," torched that sends pure insanity."
"2145820","2146740"," It's their money. "
"2148240","2149860"," They're the ones that pay taxes."
"2157000","2157600"," That's right."
"2157800","2159340"," Somebody made a landscaping business. "
"2160000","2165580"," Some guy out there, some woman out there had a business and they did the right thing."
"2166300","2167440"," And they wanted out of the house."
"2168080","2168740"," They got out to COVID. "
"2168840","2169840"," They're like, I'm going back outside."
"2170060","2170720"," I'm going to do my thing."
"2171060","2173080"," So we have that going on right now. "
"2174540","2176860"," So I think drunken miller said it perfectly."
"2177420","2181000"," We're going to get back to the structural stuff soon."
"2182420","2183140"," We will. "
"2183380","2184540"," He's like, we're going to get back to it."
"2185040","2188580"," He's like, right now we're dealing with a business cycle trade right now."
"2189440","2190520"," Like point blank said it. "
"2193280","2194840"," Smartest guy in the room right there."
"2196620","2198180"," And that's what we're doing right now."
"2198320","2199920"," We're in the middle of a business cycle trade. "
"2200860","2201840"," It's a cyclical trade."
"2202680","2203400"," JP Morgan."
"2203900","2205360"," Some of you guys don't know this. "
"2206840","2210660"," JP Morgan came out, quietly came out this past winter."
"2211640","2213420"," And they released a note to their investors."
"2213900","2214280"," People like me. "
"2215200","2216820"," And they're like, hey man, I got to tell you something."
"2217100","2218660"," I'm like, what do you, what do you got this for me?"
"2219120","2220500"," This is not what Jamie Diamond says."
"2221020","2222540"," This is what the investment guy says. "
"2223040","2225440"," Say they go, well like XLK and XLC."
"2226620","2227400"," And like tech."
"2227400","2228580"," We went through there. "
"2228660","2229120"," We mowed that."
"2229260","2230500"," We mowed that shit down."
"2231900","2233140"," How much did you move it down?"
"2233400","2233980"," Like all of it. "
"2235620","2239060"," You're like, there's a lot of good companies in there that did not go bankrupt."
"2240040","2243380"," We took them to almost zero and their party in like it's 1999."
"2244300","2248400"," You're like, you should probably buy that buy that in the beginning of the year for a cycle. "
"2248900","2249760"," This is in December."
"2251080","2252360"," They're like, we're buying that."
"2252820","2253940"," I was like, oh really you are?"
"2254180","2254620"," They're like, hell yeah. "
"2255580","2257800"," They even posted it posted a link to the."
"2257920","2259660"," They actually don't have a public anymore."
"2260260","2262360"," But I posted a public link to it in December. "
"2263080","2263980"," Not captain's office."
"2263980","2265520"," Like these guys are buying this shit."
"2266320","2267160"," And it made sense. "
"2268140","2269260"," It did make sense."
"2269780","2274760"," I mean, I'm looking back on that time frame at XLK and XLY and XLC."
"2274940","2278380"," And I'm like, yeah, they're kind of like they're almost near zero. "
"2278600","2279160"," Are we going negative?"
"2279960","2283340"," I know some people want to see it go negative, but it's so down there in the dumpster."
"2283340","2285720"," But there's likely going to be a relief trade."
"2286280","2289640"," Some kind of like a cyclical trade in there for these companies. "
"2290220","2292260"," And that's what's been going on since October."
"2293600","2297600"," You've got real risk people out there with risk in October, not even March or December."
"2298440","2299460"," They caught the bounce. "
"2300060","2301480"," They actually bought it in May and June."
"2302440","2303680"," They bought it again in October."
"2304440","2306160"," And they've run it up till now. "
"2306940","2309180"," It's now July 7th."
"2314740","2315480"," Excuse me."
"2322870","2323790"," Oh, yeah. "
"2324010","2325210"," So is there a dip buy in here?"
"2325690","2327590"," Captain Jim says, fuck, no."
"2330610","2331350"," Not yet."
"2333750","2334210"," Almost. "
"2334370","2335930"," We're coming to a nice area down here."
"2336070","2337610"," It's getting really nice down here."
"2338350","2339150"," See that right there?"
"2339710","2341710"," There's that dilly trigger down here. "
"2341710","2344470"," A whole bunch of crap right here to get through."
"2346570","2348190"," We got one more down there too."
"2350730","2352790"," And there's one more right there. "
"2355030","2359930"," I just want that to be yellow."
"2361010","2363370"," A whole bunch of traffic down in there."
"2368040","2369240"," Cap's been taken out. "
"2370520","2372960"," Yeah, that's right."
"2373100","2373960"," Sell that shit down."
"2375480","2377160"," Sell it down, baby. "
"2384640","2385240"," That's right."
"2385520","2386560"," Taking you to church, baby."
"2387040","2388120"," Back again. "
"2388500","2389620"," Just making sure everybody knows."
"2390420","2392620"," Hopefully you didn't try to buy that dip up here."
"2393640","2395100"," To me, this is sell the rip. "
"2395640","2397160"," To me, we're in a corrective action."
"2398000","2403480"," We will definitely most likely trade the daily trigger, and we will also likely trade the weekly"
"2403480","2403840"," trigger."
"2404280","2407640"," The weekly trigger currently is sitting at 416. "
"2408840","2411760"," Although by the time we get there, it's likely going to be at 420."
"2412960","2415680"," So a nice move down to 420 would make my day."
"2418300","2420580"," Yeah, it's an echo of COVID money. "
"2422780","2423960"," Well, they should have."
"2423960","2429280"," So the problem here was that, and this is what Jay Powell, how Jay Powell put it."
"2429360","2431280"," I got to pull that Senate hearing up. "
"2431580","2432320"," He's just fascinating."
"2432780","2434900"," He knew that they wouldn't pay it back."
"2435300","2441720"," He said right in the Senate meeting, he was like, look, you are setting us up for when we reopen"
"2441720","2444800"," to make all these businesses fail. "
"2445320","2449720"," You can't have Bob and Susie on Main Street."
"2450060","2451820"," You can't have Main Street go bankrupt."
"2451820","2454560"," It's like the past 20 years. "
"2455000","2456560"," I'd say it's probably longer."
"2457560","2460540"," Probably since 1978 was maybe the start of it."
"2461100","2465640"," Then you've got Reagan with the reforming of the tax codes, but somewhere in there, right?"
"2466280","2469740"," Somewhere in like that, 1978 until now. "
"2470340","2475060"," You've already had destruction of small business and mid-sized businesses."
"2475400","2481120"," I want you to know that small and mid-sized businesses have been destroyed."
"2481120","2488320"," There aren't many anymore, and the ones that are there really don't make as much profit as they"
"2488320","2490120"," once did pre-1978. "
"2491020","2497260"," There's been an attack on small and medium-sized businesses in our country that has been relentless"
"2497260","2504300"," between consolidation, between that and banks getting involved in this."
"2506660","2508640"," It's ruthless out there for them."
"2508640","2513400"," The last of those people that are out there, that would have been the death them. "
"2513720","2516560"," You probably don't want to see what that would look like."
"2517500","2520020"," I think he got that part right."
"2521500","2528860"," I think that there would have been real danger to the sovereignty of the U.S. if that took place. "
"2529620","2535600"," He was the one rational voice in that room, the only one in that room, because he was catching shit"
"2535600","2539680"," from both sides of the aisle in that Senate hearing."
"2539680","2542300"," I was fascinated by that with him saying that."
"2543080","2545640"," He demanded that they just, he was like, look. "
"2546320","2552060"," He's like, I can make it easier to give PPP money to people, because why not just give some kind"
"2552060","2556220"," of forgivable terms to float these companies through COVID?"
"2556580","2557940"," They didn't have this choice."
"2558680","2560120"," You got shut down, right?"
"2560320","2561460"," The federal government shut us down."
"2561620","2562540"," They shut the whole country down. "
"2563140","2564080"," That's what took place."
"2564260","2565040"," That is what happened."
"2565420","2566200"," And was there fraud?"
"2566480","2567280"," Fuck yeah, there was fraud. "
"2568100","2569480"," It was crazy fraud, right?"
"2569580","2570100"," We saw fraud."
"2570860","2575740"," But you're going to get fraud along with a large percentage of no fraud."
"2577780","2579400"," Not everyone commits fraud. "
"2579560","2584900"," As a matter of fact, fascinating about this is during COVID, when COVID started, I had employees."
"2585760","2589460"," I had a lot of contractors that subbed for me."
"2589900","2592700"," And a lot of these guys want paid in cash. "
"2593460","2596040"," They refuse to work unless you pay them in cash."
"2596400","2600320"," You may or may not know this, but it's legal for me to pay them in cash."
"2600960","2604920"," But what's really cool is I still file taxes for them. "
"2605700","2609980"," Whether they want me to or not, I still file taxes for them."
"2610700","2612740"," I submit my paperwork for them."
"2613040","2614800"," I do all of the stuff that I'm supposed to do. "
"2614960","2616580"," I'd say, hey, they paid them in cash."
"2617240","2618100"," Here's their receipt, right?"
"2618100","2620400"," If they want it, they want to throw out the trash, they can do that."
"2621200","2623620"," If they want to file their taxes or not, they don't have to. "
"2623800","2624740"," They can or they can't."
"2625040","2628960"," But when COVID happened, all these guys came back."
"2629940","2631840"," Or like, did you file for me?"
"2631900","2632380"," I'm like, I did. "
"2632520","2634020"," Did you file your 1099s?"
"2634240","2634940"," Yes or no?"
"2635080","2635480"," I want to know."
"2635640","2635920"," Did you?"
"2636480","2636800"," Right?"
"2636920","2637880"," Of course they didn't."
"2638280","2639520"," But I did the right thing. "
"2640440","2642000"," You know, as a business owner, I did the right thing."
"2642080","2642820"," I paid my taxes."
"2644220","2647720"," So, you know, you got to do that stuff as a business owner. "
"2647720","2651280"," If you're doing the right thing as a business owner and you get shut down."
"2652600","2654880"," You know, I mean, not everything was fraud."
"2655020","2660420"," There's a large swath of this population that does the right thing day in, day out, week in, week"
"2660420","2660720"," out. "
"2662100","2664520"," And they did what they needed to do during COVID."
"2664740","2669280"," So, telling you, so bizarre."
"2670960","2673060"," Nice bloodbath here in the spy today. "
"2673060","2678620"," Trade in 4.37.50. Getting a quick bounce here as long as we continue to trade below."
"2682120","2685700"," As long as we continue to trade below this yellow line here, you know where the trade is."
"2686060","2687660"," It is lower, baby. "
"2688980","2700830"," Spy daily trigger sitting at 4.32.96. If"
"2700830","2703110"," we get a correction, it would be so stoked right now."
"2706450","2707150"," Super stoked."
"2713040","2713480"," Yeah. "
"2714560","2716720"," So, any of my 10 and 9 guys demand cash?"
"2717300","2722020"," 10.99. 10.99. 10.99. Because I have to account for that money, right?"
"2722180","2723440"," I can't just say, oh, yeah, it's gone."
"2725880","2730520"," Well, I guess if I guess I made a cash business, I could, but nothing's cash anymore."
"2730840","2733740"," Like you if you if you had nothing's really cash anymore. "
"2734680","2735500"," No, you can't."
"2735600","2739320"," I don't know, maybe some people can get away with tax fraud, but if you're running a business,"
"2739600","2740460"," there's no point in it."
"2741260","2746640"," If your people walk away and they don't want to file their own 10.99 taxes, whatever they want to"
"2746640","2747840"," do, it's up to them at that point. "
"2760190","2761850"," I get 10.99 for $1,100."
"2762150","2764410"," And you can be the IRS is hot on me for those."
"2764770","2765230"," Yeah, dude. "
"2765690","2766970"," It's really bizarre."
"2767470","2769950"," Like, I don't know people that can, or how they get away with it."
"2770550","2775050"," But as long as I 10.99 subs that work for me, people that help me build my houses and"
"2775050","2779450"," stuff, like I, all of them, 10, not all, but the ones that are like I demand cash. "
"2780530","2785090"," A lot of these guys can't take a check or they can't take payment."
"2796270","2797970"," I don't know that they can skirt it."
"2798910","2803950"," If you figure if you're skirting something like that, you're either, you don't either don't have"
"2803950","2807630"," enough money coming through or you don't pay enough or pay out enough. "
"2808870","2810530"," And there's too much money coming in and out."
"2810670","2812490"," You can't, it's not worth keeping track of it."
"2818980","2824020"," So, Willie's saying the new research says that PPP kept a lot of businesses from permanently"
"2824020","2824460"," closing. "
"2824680","2825260"," I agree with that."
"2825640","2826380"," I think that it did."
"2827180","2829620"," I think you would have seen riots in the streets. "
"2830060","2831060"," I think it would have been really bad."
"2832580","2837780"," I know at the time, I know at the time, from what I recall at the time, like we pulled"
"2837780","2843860"," our kids out of school, we had plans to, we have a ranch, a family ranch, and we had plans"
"2843860","2844520"," to move there."
"2845300","2850000"," We were like, if they don't do anything to help these people out, the fucking country is going to"
"2850000","2850460"," implode. "
"2851520","2858640"," If they hadn't done PPP and Main Street loans, you'd be looking at what happened in 2008, right?"
"2858860","2867440"," You'd be looking at, if you remember in 2008, they weren't going to make payrolls for these large"
"2867440","2868920"," companies, like McDonald's."
"2870360","2871520"," It was like a week away, right?"
"2871660","2878280"," They weren't going to be able to make like a UPS driver or a Walmart worker or an Amazon person."
"2878320","2880040"," Like they weren't making those payrolls. "
"2880940","2885240"," And we would have been in that same situation for most of America."
"2886420","2887220"," No paychecks."
"2888580","2889980"," No one getting paid, right?"
"2890780","2895620"," Whether you were forced back to work during COVID or not, or if you were. "
"2897400","2900900"," I know people didn't get, like I know that unemployment, a lot of people didn't get unemployment."
"2901900","2904240"," They were waitlisted, waitlisted, many states, right?"
"2904440","2904620"," No unemployment."
"2905200","2909020"," If you'd had that run a mass scale across our country, it would have been the end of the United"
"2909020","2909720"," States of America. "
"2910060","2912520"," So we're the world's greatest country in my view."
"2912760","2916880"," So if that's what you had to do to keep people afloat, that's what that's what we did."
"2917900","2920260"," It was that or open, it was one or the other. "
"2932860","2935180"," So we're on July 6th."
"2935480","2938140"," We got one more day left to the week."
"2938680","2940000"," Hopefully you guys got a good vacation. "
"2940700","2941740"," I had a great vacation."
"2942120","2942520"," It was awesome."
"2943920","2945080"," I'm banged up though. "
"2945660","2946920"," Again, banged up."
"2947360","2949160"," I thought this time would be different."
"2950500","2953680"," And sure enough, it's not, hold on a second here. "
"2957980","2959380"," Sure enough, it's not."
"2961260","2963420"," So I went river rafting."
"2964540","2966440"," And I'm like, yeah, I'll be fine. "
"2966840","2968160"," I got river shoes this time."
"2969080","2970580"," And I still got wrecked."
"2971000","2972940"," Still got wrecked on the river. "
"2974320","2976000"," Again, I'm all banged up now."
"2978780","2980500"," I got banged up on the river."
"2982360","2984920"," I got banged up on the river. "
"2984920","2985600"," I got banged."
"2985740","2985900"," I did."
"2985980","2986920"," I finally climbed some hills. "
"2986920","2987960"," That was awesome on a bike."
"2988620","2990340"," I finally found some hills to go up and down."
"2990460","2990880"," That was fun. "
"2992400","2993880"," Then I have a lot of hills out here."
"2994680","2995980"," See if that's it right there."
"2996080","2996660"," Let's take a look at this. "
"3002900","3005500"," I might go back up here and recheck this one right here."
"3011460","3013000"," See if there's a trade in here maybe."
"3013640","3020860"," I'm going to get above this yellow line here. "
"3021800","3023400"," See if we can do that or not."
"3032000","3033640"," I got banged up again, man."
"3033940","3034860"," Like, totally banged up. "
"3035020","3038020"," Like, this summer, I've been very busy this summer."
"3040180","3041760"," And my body needs rest."
"3042100","3043000"," It's not getting rest. "
"3045160","3045980"," Between the part."
"3046460","3048400"," The other thing is, too, is I came home, right?"
"3048720","3050640"," And I parted with my neighbors."
"3051580","3057340"," My neighbors put on the probably the largest firework show on Inditrite. "
"3059940","3061520"," Of course, I went out and bought fireworks."
"3061780","3062540"," Not like they did, though."
"3062700","3064880"," They ran a professional show in my neighborhood. "
"3066520","3067400"," It was out of control."
"3069780","3075700"," Yeah, dude."
"3076000","3078520"," River shoes are like, yeah, but I don't think I got the good ones. "
"3078520","3082000"," So for years, I never used river shoes."
"3082400","3083020"," Never used them."
"3083420","3084940"," Sometimes I'd use booties. "
"3085940","3086500"," California."
"3087280","3088560"," A lot of the breaks."
"3089060","3092740"," There can be really heavy rock, like rocks. "
"3093640","3096840"," Sometimes I would wear like a neoprene booty surfing."
"3097660","3099960"," But for years, as a young man, I never wore them."
"3101260","3106660"," And then my last outing, river rafting, I got banged up. "
"3106660","3112120"," I had a girl was going through a rapid with her family."
"3112400","3114100"," And she fell out of the raft."
"3115260","3119620"," And she was stranded on an outcropping of rocks. "
"3120760","3123140"," So the parents were like taking down the river."
"3123740","3125420"," And I jumped out."
"3126240","3128100"," Because I've got wafing kids and all that stuff. "
"3128460","3129220"," She was crying."
"3130300","3131400"," The tears run in her face."
"3132520","3136400"," And so I jumped out of our raft and I grabbed her. "
"3137180","3138900"," And I went down the river with her."
"3140200","3143980"," And caught up to the parents and threw her back inside of the parents' raft."
"3144820","3152460"," And when I was doing that, I was jamming my legs down into some rocks trying to get some rocks"
"3152460","3154340"," to push myself off and away. "
"3157160","3158680"," And got fucked up."
"3159060","3160380"," Like major fucked up."
"3160500","3166820"," Like my feet were like, they looked like sausage, like meatloaf or something when I was done. "
"3167560","3168980"," And I was like, fuck this never again."
"3169460","3174120"," And Joe Donut just recently ripped his toe off on a dock."
"3175120","3177940"," And I'm like, dude, I only wear river shoes now. "
"3178160","3179700"," Everywhere I go, river shoes, river shoes."
"3179700","3183360"," And I had river shoes on this time I went out."
"3185540","3191180"," So I take the river shoes off and I get out of the river and I take the river shoes"
"3191180","3193100"," off because they're full of sand and all this stuff. "
"3193640","3194680"," Little rocks and pebbles."
"3195080","3197680"," And I'm like, yeah, I'm just going to start walking around my shoes off again."
"3198560","3200920"," And I got banged up. "
"3200920","3211500"," Look at these"
"3211500","3212520"," guys want to still sell."
"3213120","3215280"," These guys are like, we're taking them to the daily trigger today, Cap."
"3216060","3217800"," Going all the way down here, big boy. "
"3218820","3220280"," Let's take a look at it in a one minute chart."
"3220580","3221740"," Yeah, everything's the same, I think."
"3222340","3225140"," Right now I've got the EMA's and what do I got them at right now?"
"3225320","3226760"," Six, 27, 129. "
"3230040","3231560"," See if the bulls can."
"3236750","3238950"," Look, I'm trying to still sell this down."
"3240330","3240690"," Brutal. "
"3242530","3244890"," Sellers are like die, die, die, die."
"3249610","3250390"," We'll find out."
"3250490","3252530"," We'll find out if we'll know if this is bottoming. "
"3253590","3259310"," What you'll see is the slow, you'll start to see this line go from vertical to sideways."
"3260890","3263190"," You'll see us bounce around in here for a little bit."
"3264330","3268190"," If we can do some of this right here, we'll start to make our way higher again. "
"3269610","3272470"," So we'll just give it a good minute to cool off here and see what happens."
"3278300","3280320"," There's likely two good trades here."
"3280480","3282860"," There's likely sell the fifth, right?"
"3283200","3287560"," Get down to the daily trigger, relief rally, and then we're going to sell one more time, another"
"3287560","3288540"," big fucking trade. "
"3289520","3295140"," At least you can probably take that into the middle of the month somewhere in there."
"3295840","3297560"," There's probably a good trade here."
"3313730","3314430"," What is that?"
"3314430","3314830"," Another one. "
"3314990","3316590"," We'll check that one too right there."
"3324020","3325020"," Vacation was great."
"3325500","3330240"," I was intermittent with internet and not having internet and then some big travel time. "
"3330360","3331060"," We got rained out."
"3331240","3331880"," We got crazy."
"3332420","3333680"," Our vacation was crazy. "
"3333960","3335060"," It was really nice."
"3335860","3337880"," Then it was really crazy weather."
"3339300","3340440"," Then it got nice again. "
"3341140","3341980"," Then it got too hot."
"3343900","3344640"," What else?"
"3345540","3347180"," Did some heavy drink and that was nice."
"3348360","3349880"," Got crazy with some friends. "
"3353200","3355140"," It was all around a good time."
"3355560","3356740"," Nice breather, nice break."
"3357100","3357840"," Get away from the market. "
"3359320","3362080"," Checked in every once in a while on the internet."
"3362920","3364080"," Twitter pissed me off the other day."
"3365120","3367300"," Sometimes Twitter feeds you a bunch of shit. "
"3368100","3369220"," Of course that pissed me off."
"3378060","3379680"," The boundary waters."
"3379980","3384320"," No, I've done most of my whitewater stuff has been out west. "
"3385860","3389520"," Green River, Colorado River, the confluence, all that kind of stuff."
"3390840","3393400"," Then I started doing Michigan recently."
"3394880","3401060"," I've been doing like, not the UP. "
"3401060","3405120"," Well, there's the two headed river I want to do that I haven't done yet."
"3405620","3408740"," I think it's two headed or two headed snake river or something like that I want to do soon."
"3423380","3425280"," The daily trigger is down here. "
"3427120","3428180"," Right down here."
"3430060","3431380"," It's a daily trigger right here."
"3432480","3438960"," I think there's an intro, I think there's an intro relief in here somewhere to nail this daily"
"3438960","3439220"," trigger. "
"3443280","3446440"," There's a lot of grinding that needs to take place in here."
"3447780","3449900"," My assumption is we're not going to tag that today."
"3450580","3452080"," Here I'll show it to you guys in a better chart. "
"3452380","3452560"," Hold on."
"3459840","3461800"," You guys want to see a likely path for it all?"
"3476440","3478300"," So even in here, let's see this one here."
"3478420","3482180"," This is May 22nd, 23rd, and then 24th. "
"3482180","3483080"," You see that right there?"
"3483740","3485500"," Watch my cursor over here."
"3485660","3487140"," Even that takes some time."
"3487900","3490960"," So right here is Tuesday the 23rd, right?"
"3492100","3496640"," And that break below here is Wednesday the 24th. "
"3496780","3497780"," So maybe a full day."
"3498260","3500340"," I think we're somewhere in here."
"3502580","3503800"," Let me just see it here. "
"3505320","3507720"," So they'll be held like this dip down here."
"3507760","3508680"," We'll get close to it."
"3508680","3512500"," Then we hold, then we finally break below. "
"3512800","3516040"," So do I think we see this today?"
"3516400","3516900"," I don't."
"3517720","3522380"," I think that it's something more like this."
"3523580","3524980"," Try to hold this up. "
"3526000","3529040"," Then we come back down here and slam down into tomorrow."
"3529900","3533440"," You'll get a break and then a relief rally of some kind."
"3534720","3536380"," Failure somewhere in here. "
"3537740","3539040"," Come back down here, right?"
"3539360","3540260"," Come over here."
"3540800","3541160"," Bam."
"3541900","3542880"," And then we have a continuation. "
"3543380","3544420"," But that takes some time."
"3546140","3546680"," Hold on."
"3546820","3547180"," Nope. "
"3547460","3547940"," Hold on a second here."
"3553850","3559050"," So even though this looks really like bad, then the weekly trigger is down in here."
"3559170","3560990"," Let me see if I can draw it out for you. "
"3563770","3564770"," Let's see if we follow this."
"3564930","3565750"," I think we'll follow this."
"3567070","3569830"," It's the 15th, 17th somewhere in here. "
"3571070","3573090"," 15th, 17th somewhere in there in July."
"3579180","3580740"," So we saw the fifth, right?"
"3600320","3600880"," Nope."
"3630100","3631640"," That's our 420 right there. "
"3668000","3669240"," There's your actual break."
"3669620","3670660"," Relief rally coming back up."
"3671860","3673180"," Failure right here. "
"3677490","3678870"," It's never that clean, is it?"
"3680650","3681570"," Bam, bam."
"3682690","3683830"," Break this tomorrow."
"3684010","3685270"," That puts it into the weekend. "
"3687110","3688950"," Attempt to come back up next week."
"3691850","3692950"," Bulls are all tricky."
"3693250","3694310"," They think they're awesome sauce. "
"3695250","3696810"," And then bam, we get the next move down."
"3698230","3699450"," Somewhere, something like that."
"3699650","3701590"," Oh, it looks like shit, but something like that. "
"3707100","3710000"," Bam, bam, closed Friday out in a bloodbath this Friday, right?"
"3710360","3711360"," That's 839, 30."
"3711520","3712540"," Maybe that's later in the day."
"3713160","3715420"," Let's do like 1600, like right there. "
"3718840","3720880"," Bulls are like, yeah, we're buying the dip for Monday."
"3721220","3722320"," Woo, everything's fucking awesome."
"3723300","3725740"," Come right back into Monday and start fucking selling again. "
"3725900","3726380"," That's my hope."
"3728080","3731880"," Now, if we come back in Monday and they buy this back up, we start running higher again."
"3732040","3733000"," We'll take that trade. "
"3734220","3738540"," But we are due for a correction, so I'm on that trade."
"3738680","3740680"," I'm on that corrective trade, 420."
"3742960","3744940"," There is something to say here. "
"3745640","3752480"," If you're on this trade with me selling the fifth, you are looking to close that first part of that"
"3752480","3753080"," trade out."
"3757920","3759660"," Likely, right around 432."
"3762140","3764780"," So a breakdown here between today and tomorrow. "
"3766860","3768140"," I'd like to see this."
"3768320","3769320"," I'd like to see that tag."
"3772680","3774420"," 434, 432, if possible. "
"3777300","3779140"," However long it takes us to get there, I don't care."
"3784660","3787980"," If this is a sideways trade, then we plunge down Friday to get it."
"3789560","3793180"," Either way, or if we plunge down and do it today, I don't care. "
"3794100","3794920"," One way or another."
"3795180","3799900"," Now, if you're a bull out there and you're like, Cap, I think this is bottom, or resuming the bull"
"3799900","3800620"," run up higher."
"3801360","3803040"," We're never going to correct ever again. "
"3804580","3806780"," I'd say the odds are against you."
"3806980","3807380"," It's possible."
"3808240","3809480"," It'd be a very rare occurrence. "
"3811240","3812940"," I'm not on that trade with you."
"3813040","3815000"," I'm on that we're trading down."
"3815000","3819660"," We're going to break daily trigger today, tomorrow, maybe Monday. "
"3820220","3820960"," You'd have a nice tan."
"3821160","3821680"," Two of that tan."
"3822380","3823060"," You can see it. "
"3824740","3826240"," I touched grass, baby."
"3830400","3832540"," It's the first correction we've had in a long time, right?"
"3835200","3836620"," I'm feeling pretty good about it."
"3837980","3842740"," Imagine being a bear and not being able to call a correction all year long and then all of a"
"3842740","3844460"," sudden you finally get it. "
"3844920","3846280"," The bull's telling you we're getting it."
"3849860","3851680"," I wonder what the reasons are, too."
"3852440","3856440"," I bet you the reasons given are probably the twos and tens market crash. "
"3857420","3859120"," It's going to be something weird and stupid."
"3862380","3867980"," It's funny, too, when we do this stuff, I used to..."
"3867980","3877180"," When if this is a correction, this is usually not now, but in the past when I was younger, this"
"3877180","3879540"," would be where I drink the bear Kool-Aid."
"3881620","3885440"," This would be not today, but let's say we trade 420. "
"3886640","3892920"," Normally that's where I would go like fucking six figures in and be like, it's crash time, we're"
"3892920","3893440"," going to crash it."
"3893980","3895060"," Sure enough, we'd bounce."
"3898640","3900200"," And they would take all my money. "
"3902960","3912890"," Yeah, the whitewater is out of the sea, out"
"3912890","3915170"," of the sea, as they're absolutely ripping this year."
"3915490","3917910"," Dude, I went to..."
"3917910","3919310"," I'll do that, I'm going to bring something up for you guys."
"3919810","3928570"," I did one of the really bad years, one of the biggest snow melt years ever, like on record, and"
"3928570","3932270"," we almost died on the Colorado River. "
"3933250","3935690"," And these fucking guys lied to me."
"3936210","3938610"," They told me that they're like, nobody ever dies."
"3940070","3942510"," And you'll be fine, don't worry about it, get out there. "
"3943130","3946390"," So I got out there, and let me see if I can find it."
"3948230","3955570"," And as all these years have passed and all the time that I've spent out there at this point, I"
"3955570","3963110"," now realize that they were fucking lying to me, or they had no idea what they were talking about."
"3964330","3965650"," You guys want to see something cool?"
"3967430","3969650"," So you want to fuck around and find out, right?"
"3969950","3972410"," You want to see my playground, place I play around in?"
"3973270","3975590"," One of the big places I play around in, I'm going to..."
"3975590","3980070"," Any guys that are outdoor people, I got something really cool for you. "
"3980330","3981510"," Some you don't see ever in the news."
"3981510","3988490"," So when I make a post right now for you in Twitch and in YouTube, this is the National Park"
"3988490","3989050"," Service."
"3990150","3997850"," Now it's the history of really bad shit happening in just one place, just near Canyonlands. "
"3998730","4002570"," That's where like Moab is, you got arches, and you got needles out there."
"4003490","4005890"," This is just one of the places that I play around in."
"4005890","4015710"," I play around in the Southern Tetons, play around in Canyonlands, play"
"4015710","4017410"," around in a bunch of places in Utah actually. "
"4018270","4019210"," That's one of the places."
"4020550","4024950"," So if you're in your free time, click on that link and then bookmark it."
"4025430","4029750"," And when you're like, got some free time, just read through that thing because it's fascinating. "
"4030910","4034870"," And it's crazy to see the number of people that actually get really fucked up."
"4037030","4045430"," And what's really cool about it is, right around I think the 2000s, deaths started to drop there."
"4046130","4052150"," But into the 2000s, like in the 1960s, 70s, 80s, 90s, people were like, people were like, yeah,"
"4052290","4055970"," we're going to go do this with our home brew gear. "
"4055970","4059690"," And every year you lose like 30, 40 fucking people."
"4063570","4065310"," Like doing the shit that I do."
"4065850","4068490"," And it doesn't happen as much as it used to happen. "
"4069550","4071150"," But it is fascinating to see."
"4075660","4078040"," Yeah, I've got monthly puts on right now."
"4078640","4080640"," We've got puts for 432s. "
"4081660","4083820"," And then I've got some puts for 420s."
"4084840","4086020"," And I think I'm going to have to take them off."
"4086120","4086940"," I think I'm going to take them both off. "
"4087080","4091100"," And then I'm going to, if you get a relief rally, I'll try to jump back in."
"4094520","4098250"," So, yeah, there's no squeeze coming."
"4098950","4102229"," Well, there's a squeeze coming on PayPal, but it's probably not today. "
"4103630","4105810"," We're in the middle of a market correction, in my view."
"4106930","4110149"," Unless I'm proven otherwise, we are correcting this market."
"4110450","4111270"," Abso-fucking-lutely. "
"4112109","4115370"," If you guys want to see this, I'll show it to you."
"4116350","4118670"," I'll show you why you guys want to know why I think this."
"4120069","4121149"," I'll show it to you right now. "
"4131500","4132680"," So just chill."
"4133479","4133800"," What do you say?"
"4133939","4134600"," Chill daddy, chill."
"4136700","4140220"," Okay, so right here. "
"4148399","4150859"," Yeah, I'm probably the best fucking bear out there."
"4150979","4151520"," I kid you not."
"4151720","4153380"," I got to be the best fucking bear out there. "
"4154020","4157359"," I got to be the best fucking, I may have better fucking bear than bears are."
"4158779","4162100"," Bears couldn't fucking find a correction if it fucking smacked them in the face."
"4165700","4167380"," So, it's pretty big, really. "
"4167800","4168939"," That's a big move, right?"
"4169600","4170420"," It's pretty gnarly."
"4172560","4173560"," I should probably move that out."
"4173720","4177240"," I should probably, we shouldn't probably, we shouldn't make it so violent and vicious. "
"4182140","4184200"," So, just, I'm going to delete all this."
"4184200","4185240"," Hold on here."
"4188920","4191080"," So, why do I think we're in a correction?"
"4194040","4197520"," The same reason why I told all these fucking bears to fuck off. "
"4200380","4203640"," That this was not a bear market rally."
"4204280","4208200"," Bear rally, what the fuck they want to call it?"
"4208200","4210040"," You saw the dip skip bot, right?"
"4210360","4213720"," You saw the stabilization of how I'll show Tina a better time frame here."
"4217060","4218300"," Let's look at something here. "
"4218300","4219440"," Let's go to a day chart."
"4223240","4225160"," I hate having to do this with bears."
"4230340","4233440"," You've got Jerome Powell's greatest thing he ever did. "
"4234180","4234960"," Time, baby."
"4237980","4238420"," Time."
"4243410","4245550"," You saw the dip skip bot down here, right?"
"4245690","4246270"," We were supposed to crash. "
"4246410","4247090"," That didn't happen."
"4248330","4250450"," It's not another major one down here, right?"
"4250650","4251010"," This is October."
"4252210","4254190"," This is actually a double check right here. "
"4255330","4259590"," One, two, three, four, boom, higher, right?"
"4264010","4265770"," Monthly trigger, hard to get through."
"4266430","4268430"," It's like a magnet to some extent."
"4269170","4269710"," It's not emotional. "
"4270270","4270750"," It's like a magnet."
"4272170","4273510"," We can sell it."
"4274550","4278250"," We can reject it, but we didn't reject it, did we?"
"4279990","4281510"," The weekly, though, is emotional. "
"4282630","4284870"," It's like your cousin."
"4285950","4288470"," It's like your step-brother."
"4289910","4291930"," This is like the second child. "
"4292310","4296230"," If you're a family of three or more, you know the middle child is always crazy, right?"
"4296870","4298290"," No offense to if you're a middle child."
"4298950","4302610"," But you didn't get the first born."
"4302810","4304090"," You didn't get the last one. "
"4304690","4305690"," Kind of stuck in the middle."
"4306430","4307610"," The weekly here is very emotional."
"4308490","4309690"," Remember the fuck that thing is going?"
"4310530","4311270"," It tells you a lot. "
"4312990","4314150"," It tells you a lot."
"4315110","4316390"," I want to show you something here."
"4316490","4316750"," It's cool. "
"4316750","4316930"," It's really cool."
"4321630","4323830"," It's something really fascinating here, right?"
"4324370","4328810"," So when we're in a bull market, we should trade and touch this yellow line."
"4330830","4334810"," And we should touch the orange line every now and again. "
"4335710","4337930"," So any one of these bull runs doesn't matter."
"4338830","4340030"," It doesn't matter how short they are."
"4340250","4344390"," We should usually come back down and touch this orange a couple of times, two, three times in the"
"4344390","4344850"," middle of the run. "
"4344850","4345830"," See it right here, right?"
"4345990","4346750"," See it right here."
"4347610","4348510"," You'll see panic."
"4349950","4351590"," There's something fascinating about this. "
"4351830","4354350"," Notice how that yellow line doesn't ever cross."
"4355230","4357610"," Notice how the yellow line does not cross the orange line."
"4357970","4358650"," It does not cross. "
"4359850","4362070"," See how that yellow line crosses right here?"
"4362990","4364850"," The orange line tells you the runs over, right?"
"4365310","4366190"," The yellow line is important here."
"4366630","4369970"," The yellow line does not cross the orange in a correction."
"4371510","4374910"," If it's not a correction, the yellow line will cross the orange line. "
"4375190","4379450"," We'll know if this is not a correction and this is the actual top."
"4380350","4383250"," So even just right now where we are, we already know that we're in a bull run."
"4384090","4386870"," We know that price is above the yellow. "
"4387090","4389650"," We know the yellow is above the orange and the orange above is above the blue."
"4390470","4391350"," We already know that."
"4392470","4395050"," We were confirmed it back in March. "
"4396410","4402510"," We also know that every three months or so expect a pullback to the orange line."
"4403890","4405770"," Every bull run in history, we know that."
"4406470","4408010"," We haven't had that yet, have we?"
"4408350","4409070"," I don't see one here. "
"4409670","4411430"," I don't even see a touch of the orange line."
"4412770","4414350"," So we're kind of due for one."
"4415390","4419590"," So I'm going to give like a 35% chance at least that we're going down here to this orange. "
"4420850","4422650"," A fat chance on that."
"4423170","4424630"," It's actually bigger than that."
"4424710","4428590"," It's probably like a 65% chance that we're going to trade 420 here. "
"4429310","4431210"," Not guaranteed, but a fair chance."
"4431530","4432470"," It's a pretty good fucking chance."
"4433130","4433690"," We're going to trade 420. "
"4435470","4443350"," Now, what am I looking for is I don't care if the yellow line comes down"
"4443350","4446790"," here."
"4446790","4447850"," I don't mind that."
"4451960","4455560"," I don't mind if the orange line comes up here. "
"4456200","4456820"," That's all fine."
"4457220","4461040"," I don't care if price actually goes down here."
"4463940","4465460"," It's all fine and dandy with me. "
"4465720","4465900"," I'm good."
"4466740","4466900"," Happy."
"4467940","4468340"," Let's do it. "
"4470080","4470780"," Great, great."
"4471060","4471420"," Awesome sauce."
"4472200","4478640"," What I don't want to see is I don't want to see the orange line come up. "
"4481180","4485440"," I don't want to see or the yellow line come below it."
"4487720","4490560"," I definitely don't want to see price do that too."
"4491940","4498080"," Don't ever want to see this and start getting taken down. "
"4498080","4502280"," If I see this right here, that cross right there, that's usually bad."
"4503040","4506940"," We can usually go from, hey, this is a correction to the run is over."
"4507840","4509740"," What are the chances of this run being over?"
"4510460","4515680"," Very slim, like a 10% chance or less. "
"4516060","4521920"," It's actually less, but we'll likely get another three months at minimum out of this run."
"4522880","4530740"," Just this pullback here, I'm going to expect, if you look at any kind of bull run in history, I"
"4530740","4534540"," usually just stay above, stay above, stay above, stay above, stay above, stay above, stay above,"
"4534580","4535420"," stay above, stay above, stay above."
"4536520","4539180"," It's normal for us to come back down and hit these things. "
"4539920","4540340"," It's like a milestone."
"4540840","4541480"," There's one right there."
"4541700","4542460"," There's one right there. "
"4542840","4545060"," One, two, three, four."
"4545940","4547140"," There's five right there."
"4548220","4549400"," There's one there there and there. "
"4550280","4550780"," One there."
"4550780","4551380"," There's one there."
"4551400","4552040"," There's one there. "
"4552680","4553860"," Close, but no cigar."
"4554600","4555320"," One right there."
"4556100","4563560"," So just like even the attempt, even if we don't touch it, I'm looking for that down there, right?"
"4564540","4565740"," 42430 somewhere in here. "
"4566240","4566920"," I want to see that."
"4567400","4569180"," That's cool it down for a minute."
"4570740","4571980"," It's been some time. "
"4572140","4575080"," It's been since March 28th."
"4575860","4578660"," So for us to come back down here, cool it off a little bit."
"4579000","4579380"," Seems rational. "
"4579380","4580660"," How deep does it go?"
"4581840","4583980"," Oh, there's a bunch of stuff we can look at here."
"4586940","4590460"," So we can look at here for relief rally, the hourly trigger, right?"
"4591100","4592220"," You already see that bounce."
"4593240","4593560"," Flattening. "
"4595540","4595980"," Right."
"4596160","4597920"," I'm going to expect some flattening down in here."
"4598160","4598380"," Hold on. "
"4603650","4605470"," Expect some flattening down in here."
"4605690","4607450"," We expect this hourly to come down."
"4608110","4609910"," Are we paying attention to this hourly here?"
"4609910","4616730"," If price doesn't get above fails to get above the hourly, this begins to roll on this hourly. "
"4617790","4619530"," The correction will continue, right?"
"4620570","4624790"," So when I say to you as a bull, you want to see price above the hourly."
"4625130","4629450"," I mean it until you see price above the hourly right now."
"4629830","4630490"," Listen to me closely. "
"4631230","4634690"," Unless you see price above the hourly, you are selling this market."
"4635690","4636790"," I assure you of that."
"4636790","4642930"," If price comes up to the hourly, it's another chance for sellers to sell the market. "
"4643570","4644150"," Not buyers."
"4644810","4648050"," You need to be above it and confirm above it."
"4648530","4649530"," And I'm going to tell you something. "
"4649870","4650810"," I'm going to warn you some shit."
"4651770","4652590"," I'm going to warn you something."
"4652790","4654070"," We're very clear with you here. "
"4656150","4660950"," If price gets up here and confirms here, you still don't take that long."
"4661650","4664130"," You're going to wait for it to begin to come higher here, okay?"
"4664890","4668330"," That could be like a half a day before you even jump on that trade."
"4669010","4670590"," You've got no business in here. "
"4670950","4676450"," This is a seller's market right now trying to cool the market off."
"4677730","4685490"," So right now, I mean a corrective stance on the market into at least halfway through the month,"
"4686230","4689690"," maybe the 15th into the 19th, 21st, somewhere in that vicinity."
"4690430","4693830"," There should be at least one or two relief rallies in there. "
"4694550","4696610"," There should be a relief rally at some point."
"4699340","4702780"," Once we get near or break, we should see a relief rally."
"4703700","4705480"," And then we should see some continuation of the downside. "
"4706980","4707940"," That's what I would like to see."
"4708160","4709080"," This is this week."
"4709560","4710460"," This is next week. "
"4710840","4712060"," So it's somewhere around 420."
"4713120","4714020"," Somewhere in there."
"4715640","4718680"," If you're not positioned for this, I don't know what to say to you. "
"4719240","4722680"," If you want to get positioned for this, wait for the next one."
"4723000","4724460"," There should be another one here soon."
"4731730","4736990"," Checking again on 4.37.59. Bull's not able to break above here. "
"4737290","4741370"," We'll do this one more time and try it here and see if the bulls can get in place."
"4742550","4744470"," You know what my targets are to the downside."
"4744850","4751110"," I've got 4.32ish, 4.34. We've got another one down at 420. "
"4751110","4760350"," And if we see any kind of a relief rally here, I'm going to look to be selling it."
"4760510","4764330"," So if we come up here, anything like this, I'll sell that down."
"4764950","4765950"," I'll take another one. "
"4789020","4793780"," Yeah, even went on to, uh, even on to, uh, even told the boys I'm Wall Street bad."
"4793780","4796580"," So I'm like, I don't know how clear I have to make it."
"4797040","4798900"," Like, sell July 5th. "
"4799800","4801040"," Sell the fuck out of it."
"4802720","4811890"," Yeah, no, it doesn't get the cool part is, uh, I think the tool is done."
"4812250","4815030"," Uh, I got a lot of stuff sent to me over the weekend while I was gone. "
"4815590","4816390"," I think we're ready to go."
"4816390","4819930"," So, um, once you guys have this tool, it's going to be easy."
"4820270","4822170"," You guys are going to be able to easily see it with me. "
"4822810","4825450"," And, uh, you're going to be able to easily, oh, first break above."
"4825530","4830090"," We've seen of the 6 and 27 EMA all morning here."
"4831890","4833930"," See if there is a bull trade here. "
"4834390","4835870"," I'm going to slide this over right now."
"4837550","4839210"," Right now it's a 1046."
"4842330","4844470"," See if the bulls have a shot at or not. "
"4846670","4849730"," First break above the 6 and 27 all day long."
"4853350","4854810"," Relentless selling in the market."
"4855910","4857470"," Glad to be here with you guys today. "
"4858270","4859270"," Oh, nope."
"4859470","4860310"," I'm in the wrong thing here."
"4862350","4864070"," At least give you guys a heads up. "
"4866890","4867850"," Oh, nope."
"4868990","4870430"," No trade for the bulls yet."
"4876370","4878610"," No trade sellers in there. "
"4881810","4883470"," Just trapping the bulls."
"4883470","4891470"," Oh, so what?"
"4891570","4894030"," Vis a vis a runner saying I'm from Utah."
"4894270","4895570"," Went over in the same place. "
"4896350","4898430"," I also went over the snake in the big hoona by Jackson."
"4898770","4899550"," Hell yeah, man."
"4900770","4902110"," Dude, definitely dude. "
"4902570","4903030"," Definitely dude."
"4903330","4904170"," Almost died, dude."
"4904750","4906790"," You know, I almost got killed once on a."
"4907790","4908410"," I got. "
"4908630","4909230"," I almost got."
"4909470","4909810"," I almost got."
"4909970","4911350"," I think I told this story, but. "
"4913170","4914390"," I almost got murdered."
"4914550","4916950"," That murdered, but I almost killed my wife and my kid once."
"4917850","4918730"," That's a whole nother story. "
"4918870","4920070"," I think I've told it here before, but."
"4920610","4921550"," Like I had a widow maker."
"4921890","4924050"," Big cottonwood came down, blocked my exit. "
"4924750","4927990"," I wasn't like a ditch which drainage fucking big giant storm."
"4928490","4928910"," And."
"4932650","4940370"," If you're bullish on trade, the trigger. "
"4941090","4942110"," Hell yeah, me too."
"4943690","4945190"," Oh, I got something else for you guys."
"4950860","4956640"," Yeah, well, we've got three ways to check this stuff. "
"4957380","4958980"," So I've got three signals."
"4959280","4961600"," Matter of fact, I'll look right now because they have not looked."
"4962680","4963840"," Let me look at something really quick. "
"4966680","4967820"," I got to look at something here."
"4968980","4973240"," I've got three ways proprietary ways to see if we're going to crash."
"4974840","4976180"," And I'm going to look right now and just check. "
"4982100","4983740"," Dude, look at that gap on SPX."
"4985120","4986860"," I'm looking at SPX in a one minute started."
"4987100","4988080"," It just looks so gnarly. "
"4992120","4995380"," Yeah, there's not there's no crash signal here on SPX."
"4996120","4996520"," None."
"4997680","4998180"," Nope. "
"5000690","5001190"," Nope."
"5002290","5003110"," Just correction."
"5003430","5004010"," That's all I see. "
"5004730","5006510"," And then I'll look at something else here."
"5006990","5011110"," I've got a higher time frame on the tool that I can look at."
"5012910","5014410"," You load up this chart here. "
"5036980","5038500"," See what I can see here."
"5056250","5063320"," Oh, no, we got more to go up."
"5063420","5064740"," We have more up to go, bros. "
"5065320","5066520"," We're good to go right now."
"5068560","5069940"," We got way more, dude."
"5070240","5072980"," The monthly here is only trading eight. "
"5074180","5075480"," No, we got way."
"5075900","5078340"," Dude, this run is not over by a mile, dudes."
"5079640","5080280"," By a mile. "
"5080460","5081060"," We're not even there."
"5081440","5082420"," Dude, we're not even there."
"5083460","5085120"," Not even there yet. "
"5086520","5087600"," We're nowhere near."
"5087860","5089020"," Dude, we have so much bull run."
"5089300","5090800"," Dude, we have so much bull run in front of us. "
"5090920","5091400"," It's not even funny."
"5094500","5095400"," It's not even funny."
"5096340","5097280"," It's like kind of gross. "
"5100940","5102840"," I know I see the rocket ship here."
"5105020","5106160"," I see it, boys."
"5108480","5109620"," I'm watching for it. "
"5109620","5112460"," If it happens, if it happens, I'll take a day trade with you."
"5115780","5116980"," Dude, we're in correction."
"5117400","5117660"," That's it. "
"5119240","5121040"," I don't see the crash that."
"5122260","5125320"," I don't see the third leg down or something or the second leg down."
"5125500","5126560"," I'm not seeing it right now. "
"5126560","5130540"," A lot of the three things that I use to look for the crash."
"5131300","5132660"," All three are fine right now."
"5133080","5133660"," We're good. "
"5138180","5140640"," I had to check because I haven't checked in a couple of weeks."
"5141240","5141760"," I always forget."
"5142580","5150680"," I talked to Winky and I'm like, I have to remember to look every few weeks. "
"5156470","5157350"," On that note."
"5159010","5164530"," I went and saw Winky on two or three weeks ago."
"5164630","5169350"," I went to a concert and I saw Winky at a LCD sound system. "
"5173210","5175250"," Hopefully you guys are short as fuck, man."
"5175530","5182620"," I saw Winky at a LCD sound system."
"5183440","5185600"," He said he was going to give me another one of these. "
"5186860","5190940"," He grabbed Mr. Zach Morris from Twitter."
"5191760","5195100"," He got arrested for nefarious shit."
"5195960","5200800"," They released this company or a couple of companies. "
"5200960","5201860"," This one's from Hallmark."
"5202860","5208460"," He grabbed Cocaine Bear and Mr. Zach Morris."
"5209140","5210580"," Cocaine Bear came from another company. "
"5211960","5214040"," We figured we'd give one of these away on stream."
"5216080","5217020"," Here's what we're going to do."
"5218080","5220620"," I've got Mr. Zach Morris, a figurine. "
"5222040","5223720"," I think we've got a bunch of these."
"5223880","5226520"," I'm not positive, but I've got one right here."
"5227360","5235680"," We're going to do giveaways for Mr. Zach Morris and Cocaine Bear. "
"5235920","5236580"," What we're going to do is this."
"5237960","5238460"," Oh, dude."
"5238940","5239960"," Just make it rain, baby. "
"5240920","5242220"," Make it rain blood."
"5245760","5246600"," Yeah, no, no."
"5246740","5252360"," We were talking about Mr. Zach Morris probably fucked. "
"5253400","5256860"," When the government brings a case against you, you usually lose."
"5260900","5263160"," We're going to run a..."
"5264060","5265560"," We're going to run a..."
"5265560","5268140"," What I'll do is if you want, I'll sign this for you."
"5270640","5272200"," I'll sign it whenever you want me. "
"5272280","5273800"," I'll say whatever you want me to say on it."
"5274460","5279560"," I'll say Mr. probably have seen the last of Mr. Zach Morris for a period of time."
"5279880","5280620"," Whatever you want me to write. "
"5282340","5283780"," I love Mr. Zach Morris."
"5284200","5285040"," I don't know."
"5285140","5286720"," Whatever you want me to write, I'll write anything you want. "
"5286900","5288860"," If you win, and I'll mail it to you."
"5289680","5293400"," So this is courtesy of a winky face."
"5294540","5296140"," So I think he's on vacation right now. "
"5296220","5296800"," He might be in stream."
"5296980","5297220"," Let me check."
"5299500","5300960"," I don't know if he's here or not. "
"5301760","5303380"," I think he's on vacation still."
"5303860","5306360"," So we're going to..."
"5306360","5306660"," We're going to..."
"5306660","5307440"," We're going to run up."
"5307620","5309120"," I'm going to do this in Discord. "
"5310500","5312240"," I'm going to do this jam in Discord."
"5312820","5318560"," So first thing I'm going to do here is show Discord some love here."
"5319660","5323200"," So if you're not a member of Discord, Discord's changed a ton. "
"5325020","5326620"," The members have been empowered."
"5327360","5329960"," So we have members that are run the place."
"5331520","5337280"," Then we've got moderators that are empowering the members, right?"
"5338660","5341860"," And then we've got the administrators that are facilitating this. "
"5342200","5346900"," So if the..."
"5346900","5354500"," What I'll do is I'll get with the Discord admins and they can run a promotion with..."
"5357300","5358680"," With members of Discord."
"5358980","5359780"," Here's how it'll go."
"5361560","5362420"," Here's how it'll go. "
"5363080","5364820"," You can make up whatever you want to do for this."
"5366020","5369640"," Run a poll in the Discord."
"5371540","5374020"," Is this a..."
"5374960","5379080"," Are we getting a check of the daily trigger?"
"5379980","5381380"," Are we getting a correction?"
"5382740","5383860"," Or is this the start of a crash?"
"5383860","5390100"," So I want to know, are we going to bounce around or in around the daily trigger?"
"5390840","5393400"," Are we going to bounce in around the weekly trigger?"
"5395320","5396420"," Or are we just going to..."
"5396420","5397060"," This is it. "
"5397280","5398720"," This is the last leg down."
"5399040","5399940"," We're going to crash this market."
"5400800","5401980"," Two's and 10's. "
"5403480","5405280"," And maybe we'll get up a price target."
"5406060","5406420"," Or how about..."
"5407180","5408140"," Let's redo it."
"5410020","5410500"," Within a dollar. "
"5412860","5413860"," Within a dollar."
"5414000","5414720"," Where does this..."
"5415220","5416320"," What's the spy bottom?"
"5417700","5421300"," What's the spy bottom on this correction?"
"5422860","5425800"," To like the dollar, like 421."
"5426820","5427780"," We'll do it. "
"5427880","5433760"," I don't care if you give SPX, ES, or SPY."
"5434420","5435000"," Any number you want."
"5435960","5438120"," If you're in a futures trader, go back to your like..."
"5438120","5439280"," It's going to bounce right off..."
"5439860","5443380"," I don't know, 423.75 or something like that. "
"5444040","5445780"," We got prices right rules too."
"5446720","5451720"," So the closer you are to the actual number, we'll be the deciding factor."
"5452060","5454440"," So we'll run a poll and discord. "
"5456760","5457840"," It's within a dollar."
"5458140","5460360"," So if you get it within a dollar without going over, you're the winner."
"5460680","5463060"," If someone gets it closer than you, they're the winner. "
"5463280","5470100"," So like if David AMS was like, it's 423.74. And that motherfucker is like within like 0.2 cents"
"5470100","5470600"," a minute or something."
"5471220","5471780"," He'll get this."
"5472960","5475200"," And I'm going to throw a $100 bill in this. "
"5476300","5478200"," So you get a $100 bill of cash."
"5479740","5481060"," I'll stuff it inside the box."
"5482000","5483040"," And I'll mail it to you. "
"5485220","5488980"," So $100 and the ornament."
"5491560","5493260"," So any of you..."
"5493260","5494760"," I would say you have to be more exact."
"5495180","5496820"," Like try to give an exact number. "
"5497500","5498440"," Like Mr. Zack Morris."
"5498720","5500820"," Try to be like exact Zack."
"5501420","5502680"," We will call the poll exact Zack. "
"5503640","5504760"," And you give an exact..."
"5504760","5508980"," I would give an exact like 423.17. Because it's prices right rules, right?"
"5509620","5511140"," Prices right rules, you can't be over."
"5511940","5512960"," You have to be under, right?"
"5513660","5514100"," I think, right?"
"5514920","5515420"," Do I have that right?"
"5515640","5517620"," You have to be under the price."
"5518680","5521220"," And the closest to that price under. "
"5524640","5525620"," Is the winner."
"5528180","5528560"," So..."
"5529800","5531520"," Yeah, I got all 10 highs, too."
"5532780","5534120"," I got all 10 highs, too. "
"5535300","5537880"," I'm talking about this, but this correction right here."
"5538940","5539320"," So..."
"5539320","5541460"," Do we get a bounce, right?"
"5541620","5543440"," So do you get a bounce on the daily, around the daily?"
"5543700","5544460"," Do you get a bounce on the weekly?"
"5545380","5548440"," We rolling this over and the bottom is actually, I don't know, fucking 360."
"5549240","5550280"," Whatever you got. "
"5552580","5554240"," And I mean like this correction."
"5554720","5556580"," Not like this today, this today's."
"5557020","5557960"," I mean like this move. "
"5559680","5562200"," So let me clarify this."
"5562440","5563580"," Make sure I got this correct here."
"5566280","5569000"," So let me be very clear in this. "
"5577210","5579190"," If we do this here, right?"
"5579730","5580770"," And we start going higher?"
"5582390","5583110"," That's your bet."
"5583390","5583870"," Does that make sense?"
"5586570","5590750"," If we do this though, start going back down to grab that."
"5592350","5593050"," That's the winner. "
"5593430","5596750"," So we're going to check to see if we actually break this before I send it out."
"5597850","5599070"," So maybe we can..."
"5599070","5600590"," It's like if we do this, we start bouncing."
"5600710","5601930"," You're like, yeah, this guy won. "
"5602830","5603970"," And all of a sudden we keep rolling."
"5605150","5607630"," You did not win, so..."
"5607630","5611050"," I want to see the price get above the hourly and we continue higher."
"5611870","5612870"," And then I'll declare a winner. "
"5614830","5617690"," So it might take a week or two to declare a winner here."
"5619690","5621010"," So place your bets."
"5621570","5621870"," How about this?"
"5622190","5623250"," This is going to take a minute. "
"5623450","5626270"," Let me see if I can find a..."
"5626270","5627150"," No, don't do it here."
"5627710","5629530"," I'm going to do this inside the discord."
"5630510","5631450"," Yes, don't do it here. "
"5631990","5632930"," Just relax for a minute."
"5633570","5634090"," Hold that easy."
"5638100","5640660"," I won't partake of this. "
"5640920","5641660"," I already have my number."
"5641720","5643600"," You guys know my numbers already, so..."
"5644880","5645760"," Let's see if..."
"5645760","5647600"," Is there anybody inside?"
"5647820","5649260"," Can we run this inside the discord?"
"5651000","5652240"," Let me ask the moderators."
"5693680","5695180"," Let's see if we can get a contest going. "
"5695960","5697360"," It's Fourth of July, man."
"5705460","5707180"," It's still party time, right?"
"5707180","5708620"," In some way, shape, or form."
"5716800","5719680"," Dude, Epez, why are you always trying to buy the dip, man?"
"5720260","5721440"," Stop trying to buy the dip. "
"5725510","5726610"," Stop trying to buy the..."
"5726610","5728490"," If you want to buy the dip, what are the rules?"
"5730390","5733210"," Someone in the chat, tell me the rules, I'm buying the dip."
"5738920","5746520"," If you're going to do an inter-day trade to the upside, Price has to be above the 27 EMA,"
"5746820","5749480"," right?"
"5750240","5751680"," At least a one-minute chart."
"5751840","5752880"," Let's go to a five-minute chart. "
"5754360","5755980"," We're not even above..."
"5757300","5759180"," We're not even above..."
"5759920","5761480"," It's so beautiful, look at that."
"5762820","5766920"," We're not even above the 27 EMA here for a dip buy."
"5770000","5771720"," We're not even above this, are we?"
"5772700","5775120"," We're not above 43836, are we?"
"5776180","5777160"," We're not, are we?"
"5777700","5779040"," There's no dip buy here. "
"5779960","5782260"," We're selling the rip right now, aren't we?"
"5782920","5784940"," I fucking love our members."
"5785760","5787180"," They're like, is it time?"
"5788440","5791160"," No, this is a hand grenade for you to jump on."
"5793480","5795380"," There's no point in calling a bottom here. "
"5797120","5805430"," You can trade this possibly, but if you're going to trade that, you're going to be looking for..."
"5807750","5808690"," Yeah, you see that."
"5808890","5810110"," I know you see it."
"5810210","5810770"," I see it too. "
"5811750","5812290"," I see it."
"5813430","5814610"," I see what you want to do here."
"5816790","5820690"," But again, you need price above 437s, 42. "
"5821950","5824530"," And you need the Confirmatee."
"5824530","5831150"," You need one, two, three, four, bar up, bar down, and then even just the confirmation of higher."
"5832230","5834970"," And that bar has to go over the white line right here, right?"
"5835670","5837630"," That's the only trade you got. "
"5837810","5841010"," And even there, it's going to be good for like right here, right?"
"5841650","5843110"," It's only good to like right there."
"5843210","5844770"," It's like a five-minute trade from here to here."
"5847010","5847430"," Right?"
"5848730","5850230"," There's still no trade for you. "
"5850950","5852370"," Not even on a six CMA."
"5852590","5853890"," There's no trade for you right now."
"5854470","5854690"," None. "
"5854890","5856150"," There's no trade for you to buy it up."
"5857850","5858250"," Nothing."
"5859330","5860330"," Yeah, there's savages. "
"5860650","5861570"," I love all of you out there."
"5861590","5862190"," There's savages."
"5866570","5868210"," Joey Donuts in the house right now. "
"5868330","5868830"," What's up, brother?"
"5874740","5875140"," Nice."
"5893970","5899930"," All right, so it looks like John L is going to set up a room for everyone."
"5899930","5903910"," It's going to be called the Zack Morris bottom calls. "
"5906530","5907570"," Fucking love it."
"5908590","5909870"," You all get one chance."
"5910470","5913790"," Don't be in there fucking around editing your answers. "
"5914290","5916050"," Don't be going crazy in there."
"5916490","5918370"," So we're going to create a channel inside Discord."
"5919050","5921210"," It's going to be the Zack Morris bottom calls. "
"5921950","5923570"," The rules are like this."
"5924350","5925630"," It's price is right rules."
"5925870","5927410"," Whoever's closest to the bottom. "
"5927410","5930050"," If you pick the bottom."
"5931510","5935210"," And for the confirmation that that is actually bottom."
"5936430","5941330"," We have to trade and hold above the hourly and daily trigger. "
"5942170","5943650"," I'll be the judge on that."
"5943850","5945150"," Like the corrections over."
"5945710","5948390"," So if the corrections and one other thing. "
"5948630","5951410"," If we still roll over, if I'm like, yeah, the corrections over."
"5952170","5953810"," And it's winds up being a trap."
"5954350","5958490"," I'll send a second one out to the second person that actually called it. "
"5958550","5959850"," Okay, like a second place."
"5960530","5962430"," If that happens, if I'm wrong."
"5966390","5967650"," So here we go. "
"5967870","5970630"," So John L is going to make this room."
"5971950","5980370"," I want you to post."
"5980370","5981750"," Whatever it is. "
"5981950","5982870"," And the price."
"5984190","5985690"," That the correction is over."
"5988290","5989430"," Wherever that bottom is. "
"5990250","5991950"," I don't mean for like the next week."
"5992650","5993830"," I mean, you know what I mean."
"5994030","5995730"," I know that you guys know what I mean, right?"
"5996270","5999050"," We bounce at the daily that we roll back down to the weekly. "
"5999530","6000490"," That's not the bottom, right?"
"6000610","6001690"," The weekly is actually the bottom."
"6002550","6004810"," I mean, when the correction is over and we continue higher."
"6005470","6006450"," If you think we're going to crash. "
"6008430","6009750"," Put a number down there."
"6009870","6010550"," If you think that."
"6011430","6014610"," Put a number down there because if if we roll the daily, roll the weekly. "
"6015230","6017030"," And we start to drown."
"6017790","6021330"," Like let a head up to breathe air and we start to roll continue to roll over."
"6022210","6024910"," I'll hold on to that prize until that that happens. "
"6026070","6028190"," And we'll start looking at your your bottom numbers."
"6032490","6032850"," Hilarious."
"6033030","6033750"," I appreciate John. "
"6033970","6037650"," So it looks like he's going to he's got it."
"6037790","6037950"," Boom."
"6038490","6039470"," The Zack Morris channel. "
"6039690","6040730"," Oh, did you guys already in it?"
"6040950","6041570"," Hell yeah."
"6043050","6043950"," What do we got in here?"
"6044050","6045570"," We got a bunch of people posting right now."
"6047750","6051050"," Right on right on right on right on right on. "
"6051130","6051450"," Oh, yes."
"6051730","6052250"," PX got it."
"6052770","6056330"," Whole bunch of people putting their whole bunch of people inside there right now. "
"6056330","6058630"," Hell yeah, boys and girls."
"6060130","6061450"," Right on right on."
"6062210","6064270"," Yeah, this is like the bottom. "
"6064450","6065490"," Wherever the bottom is."
"6066230","6068790"," Five minute bull trade coming up right now."
"6070490","6074910"," Bull's looking to make a quick trade here on the spy to the upside. "
"6086020","6089640"," Bull's first trade above right now for them."
"6090820","6093980"," No trade for the bulls the entire day."
"6096820","6098820"," Let's find out where the hourly is. "
"6099520","6101020"," Let's take a five minute chart here."
"6102380","6104140"," Got another red bar above."
"6104460","6105980"," This is where the big boys are right here. "
"6107240","6108700"," Big boys right here."
"6109580","6110640"," So the big sellers are."
"6111420","6112920"," So the swellers are right here. "
"6114540","6116400"," We got the hourly trigger crowd up here."
"6119780","6133460"," 441.30. So"
"6133460","6136280"," if you don't know anything what we're doing right now, I want to show you this, okay?"
"6137740","6139940"," So your big sellers are right here."
"6140480","6142840"," Those are your big boys are right here. "
"6143820","6146120"," These are some okay sellers right here."
"6146700","6149080"," And these are your Jim bros, young guys, right?"
"6149320","6150140"," Young sellers in here."
"6153440","6155360"," Right, so here, here, and here. "
"6155640","6156740"," Big sellers in the house."
"6158160","6161180"," We've got the six EMA and a five minute chart right here."
"6162300","6166340"," And this has been relentless to the downside, right?"
"6167500","6171220"," Bull's trying to come up with a trade between at least here and here. "
"6172500","6174680"," 438 32 in the upside."
"6175400","6178760"," They need to stay above the six EMA here for that to happen."
"6179760","6181060"," We'll see if they can do it. "
"6181100","6182520"," We'll switch back to a one minute chart."
"6183360","6184520"," Find out if they can."
"6185300","6187100"," You're getting the double tap right now. "
"6187140","6189660"," This is the recheck part of the trade, right?"
"6190260","6191060"," I showed you this earlier."
"6192000","6194980"," You get from one minute chart, you get the push higher."
"6195980","6199960"," And then this is where you check to see if we can get a trade to the upside. "
"6201180","6203520"," So right here, you're looking for a move higher."
"6204220","6205080"," Look at the green bars."
"6205280","6206440"," If you see those green bars. "
"6207620","6210280"," You can usually catch a trade to the upside."
"6210520","6211260"," So we'll move this over."
"6212700","6215360"," And we're going to watch right now and see if the bulls can put it together. "
"6217220","6219460"," First attempt here for the bulls today."
"6243190","6246110"," Yeah, you feel like a lot of people will have some urgency to want to put on some trade."
"6246470","6247090"," Let the trade come near. "
"6247390","6249850"," Yeah, I'm in full sell mode."
"6250030","6254670"," So I'm in like, sell this fucking market to the depth of hell right now."
"6255390","6257070"," Like the cheaper, the better. "
"6257870","6259310"," I'd really like to see like 420."
"6260790","6262490"," That's where my target is."
"6263430","6268070"," Roughly 420 and then a big move up into the fall. "
"6269010","6269910"," Big giant move."
"6276450","6278410"," Bottom for today or longer timeframe."
"6279270","6284410"," If I had to guess from what I went through earlier this morning, we have a sideways trade coming"
"6284410","6284630"," up. "
"6285450","6289490"," And then a blood or sideways trade to reposition to go short."
"6290730","6295010"," And then we're going to tag this tomorrow, hopefully."
"6295750","6297430"," We tagged this daily trigger. "
"6299670","6301110"," So I'd like to see."
"6305230","6312210"," Personally, I'd like to see some like this maybe and then a boom downside by tomorrow."
"6312210","6313650"," This will be going into tomorrow. "
"6315450","6317570"," But if we do it today, it's good enough for me too."
"6317710","6319130"," I don't care how long it takes to do it."
"6319210","6323450"," There's a lot of all down here for a lot of shit to get through for bears right now. "
"6324510","6326350"," And I'm looking for repositioning too."
"6326590","6331330"," So at some point, if I can take profit and we can trade wherever they are, wherever the hourly"
"6331330","6334670"," trigger winds up being, tag that one more time and take this down."
"6336690","6338970"," I'm in full bear clothes right now. "
"6338970","6340750"," I mean, no way bullish here."
"6341270","6351780"," I mean like"
"6351780","6355980"," full like full bear town full blast through full."
"6356420","6357520"," Bring me for 20. "
"6357660","6358060"," Bring it fast."
"6358060","6363880"," Bring it hard by like the 15th 15th to the 20th 21st, maybe 19th."
"6364080","6369700"," Throw like a one relief rally in there and two squeezes to one squeeze. "
"6370380","6373960"," More down relief rally more down."
"6374960","6376080"," That's something like that."
"6385060","6386360"," What do you amaze they use?"
"6386660","6392020"," So don't use the amaze, but I can usually get them close on the amaze for like a week or"
"6392020","6393700"," so on a regular chart. "
"6394580","6400880"," I can, you can, I usually run with like a six, a 27 or a 30 in between 27 and"
"6400880","6405340"," 30 and then a one 20, a one 16 to a one 29 pick your poison."
"6405340","6407780"," Then I run on a one and five minute chart."
"6414850","6417030"," He said, go find me for Mr. Zach Morris. "
"6417290","6418130"," I can't do that, man."
"6418270","6424030"," I'm not, I'm not a fan of that kind of shit or I'm not a fan of what they were"
"6424030","6424310"," doing."
"6424750","6428290"," So I'm pretty anti that. "
"6428990","6434490"," A whole bunch of stuff down here to fill whole mess of stuff down here."
"6436870","6437350"," Oh, man."
"6437510","6439470"," A whole bunch of cleaning down below the needs done. "
"6442850","6443670"," Now, can I look at meta?"
"6443870","6444750"," Yeah, I can look at meta for you."
"6444990","6445170"," Hold on."
"6448680","6449740"," What's neat about this too. "
"6449820","6453280"," I want to talk to you guys about some cool stuff."
"6453440","6454640"," So meta had a nice bounce there."
"6455280","6456560"," They bounced off their hourly trigger. "
"6456760","6457260"," Let's take a look at meta."
"6459260","6460040"," It's a good one to look at."
"6460140","6461940"," We actually got a couple of things we got to look at here. "
"6467060","6469780"," I want to show you guys something here."
"6471320","6474540"," So meta is bouncing off of its hourly trigger."
"6474980","6475960"," You can see that looks great. "
"6476580","6478080"," Clean back down to recheck it again."
"6479160","6484240"," 293.82. I personally would like to see meta."
"6488220","6491540"," Maybe trade 287.84 somewhere in there. "
"6491540","6492820"," Before the correction is done."
"6495020","6496360"," Still bullish on meta though."
"6496940","6498120"," Just needs to cool off. "
"6498400","6499900"," I just need meta to cool off."
"6500080","6500580"," Not so much."
"6501040","6501800"," We ain't going higher. "
"6502080","6503320"," Just cool, cool the jets."
"6505160","6509960"," But I do want to show you guys something here on small caps."
"6513120","6520700"," And I want you to see, I want you to see something important here. "
"6522560","6524420"," It's a 30 minute chart on small caps."
"6528060","6535740"," So small caps usually shows you the way for risk on in the market."
"6538400","6543580"," If we are risk on in the marketplace, small caps does well. "
"6544440","6550000"," If we're risk off in the marketplace, small caps does horrible."
"6551380","6552460"," It's really bad."
"6554060","6558380"," But small caps to me is showing something different. "
"6558800","6559640"," I don't know if I can show this here."
"6561080","6561960"," Am I in the right chart here?"
"6562180","6562740"," Yeah, I'm in the right chart."
"6566620","6567440"," In a second here. "
"6570400","6571500"," So small caps."
"6584340","6585160"," Small caps."
"6587900","6590060"," My cursor right back here, right?"
"6590960","6594520"," It's here breaking down below this risk off moment here. "
"6594680","6596600"," You see that big push down for small caps?"
"6597220","6599400"," Kind of the same thing happening right here right now, right?"
"6600280","6602920"," But there's something telling you something different here."
"6603720","6605720"," There's a little secret going on here."
"6607800","6614060"," And we closed this last month on an upside right here. "
"6614160","6617220"," You can actually see it right there on an upside."
"6617720","6620380"," A reversal that's hiding in the background."
"6620920","6628060"," So I'm looking for a dip buy on small caps for a much larger run higher. "
"6628060","6633060"," I also want to direct you to the reversal here in the weekly."
"6634440","6642420"," Up, up, up, and caught a tick on the monthly."
"6643660","6648400"," And it's telling you something that you're not seeing in price in small caps right now. "
"6649100","6653840"," This is likely the dip to buy in small caps."
"6653840","6662100"," So for me personally, I have a feeling, I have a thought process here that"
"6662100","6665900"," you're going to get that."
"6666220","6669980"," You get the one, two, three, and then four buy on small caps. "
"6671200","6679220"," I'm looking for a major buy here for small caps to turn very bullish."
"6680080","6681100"," Extremely bullish."
"6686710","6689870"," Where small caps has not participated. "
"6691450","6700190"," That it's going to actually swing higher and squeeze quite big into the end of the year."
"6700730","6705650"," So I'm going to stick, watch small caps very closely."
"6706590","6709710"," And then next week or two, keep your eye on it. "
"6710970","6713830"," Any bloodbath that's down here, I think this is very much like Bitcoin."
"6715110","6719770"," Where you're going to have a lot of bears out here saying this is doom and gloom, end of the"
"6719770","6721010"," stock market kind of stuff."
"6721550","6723650"," And this is very much like the Bitcoin set up. "
"6725470","6728150"," Where people are thinking that this is the crash."
"6730270","6735490"," But it's not, it's actually the place to buy like we've made an attempt, made an attempt."
"6736330","6737590"," But this is going to be the big one. "
"6738070","6739550"," So keep your eye on small caps."
"6740430","6742930"," And small caps right now telling you risk off, right?"
"6743190","6744610"," But telling you risk off in the market."
"6746490","6747990"," So they're giving you fair warning. "
"6748510","6749490"," Hold on here."
"6751430","6752990"," Small caps giving you fair warning."
"6753170","6754490"," This is where in risk off right now. "
"6756970","6759690"," But at the same time, remember that Bitcoin call?"
"6760970","6766350"," I know you don't want to take those, like make those calls, but from what I can see."
"6768250","6769710"," It's almost like we're in."
"6771690","6775110"," Not October, not December, somewhere in March. "
"6777210","6782070"," Or maybe it is December, like December and small caps right now."
"6782630","6789330"," So if you're looking for a dip buy for over performance for the rest of the year."
"6790170","6793350"," I think it might be small caps and not so much. "
"6794510","6796250"," I think everything else is going to perform."
"6797510","6799890"," But I think small caps is like where it's at."
"6800470","6804770"," I don't know that that dip buy or I don't think that dip buy is today. "
"6806010","6808610"," But it's the one that I'm looking for personally."
"6808610","6812670"," So when I get out of my bearishness right that I have."
"6813050","6815130"," I have some pretty bad bearishness right now. "
"6815210","6815790"," I'm pretty bearish."
"6816850","6819450"," But once I stop being bearish."
"6823530","6827230"," I think I'm going to be extremely bullish on small caps. "
"6828030","6834250"," For an over performance into Lisa and of Q4, maybe even Q1 of 2024."
"6834250","6838810"," So that's the one that I'm paying attention to more so than anyone right now."
"6840230","6842030"," I think it's your reminds me of Bitcoin. "
"6857900","6859040"," You want to talk about the color?"
"6860340","6861840"," I wasn't going to talk about it just yet."
"6863640","6864200"," We can."
"6870470","6872770"," Oh, you want to know what Zach Morris was doing?"
"6872870","6873410"," I can tell you. "
"6873650","6875410"," It's like an oldest trick in the book."
"6877670","6878410"," You buy it."
"6878550","6879710"," You find a low float. "
"6881450","6882890"," You find something that's low float."
"6885330","6886030"," I buy."
"6886870","6887890"," Let's say I find a low float. "
"6888150","6888410"," I buy."
"6889090","6890670"," What do you guys think I have for reach out there?"
"6891570","6895370"," This is why I trade the spy with you guys because I can't be accused of it."
"6898970","6901530"," What I do is I find something that's low float right. "
"6903430","6909050"," Take like a million bucks maybe but I thought about a million dollars and I can break that up"
"6909050","6914210"," between like buying the underlying buying a bunch of penny calls."
"6914770","6916450"," It's called like six months out."
"6917910","6920650"," So I buy a bunch of penny calls. "
"6921330","6924770"," Spend a couple hundred thousand dollars on that one big trade."
"6927330","6929030"," Now it's on the books, right?"
"6930410","6933270"," So you then see that pop up."
"6933570","6935130"," It's unusual option trade. "
"6935890","6937190"," It stands out, right?"
"6938090","6946530"," Then I load up a bunch of the underlying and then I go to let's say a discord and I"
"6946530","6947830"," tell my admins first."
"6948670","6952070"," I'm like, okay, we bought all this and we're long this."
"6952450","6953370"," So then they load up. "
"6954590","6955930"," Then they tell the moderators."
"6955930","6958050"," The moderators then they load up."
"6959690","6961610"," Then they tell all of the members. "
"6962170","6964150"," So you have like 2,000 people, right?"
"6965530","6968310"," And then you tell everybody, hey, tell all your friends."
"6969390","6971490"," So they get on to social media."
"6971730","6972590"," They go into Wall Street bets. "
"6972850","6974490"," They go on to Stock Twits."
"6976470","6979010"," Maybe I pay off a can name name."
"6979210","6981810"," Let's say I pay off one of these guys on FinTwit. "
"6982530","6984450"," That talks about unusual flows, right?"
"6984450","6985310"," They're known for that."
"6986070","6987410"," Pay that guy off some money."
"6988930","6995090"," Then I tell all of you guys, go on to FinTwit and talk about this ticker. "
"6995690","6997330"," So this ticker gains some traction now."
"6998210","6999210"," What kind of reaching the gap?"
"6999990","7001370"," Some of you might know, some of you probably don't."
"7001790","7004270"," So my streams are re-streamed too. "
"7004930","7006850"," So we're probably reaching in the course of a week."
"7008690","7014490"," I have the actual numbers, but 100,000 people in the course of a week, like unique people."
"7014990","7015650"," 100,000. "
"7016630","7020430"," I reach 18,000 on one handle on FinTwit."
"7020670","7024750"," I reach another, I don't know, 18,000."
"7024810","7025650"," Let's call it 15,000. "
"7025750","7026390"," Then you have the re-streams."
"7026430","7027170"," We don't even know about, right?"
"7028030","7029510"," Probably have some professionals in here."
"7030170","7032310"," Pumping numbers, probably track the stream, watch the stream. "
"7032790","7033230"," Have it on the background."
"7033570","7033710"," Couple."
"7035230","7038750"," Then you've got, I've got another handle out there at Kaplan's Alpha. "
"7039510","7041370"," Every morning, people rely on their low levels, right?"
"7042110","7042670"," Tell all those people."
"7042670","7044030"," Hey, this ticker right here."
"7045210","7047370"," So what does that roll into reach?"
"7047730","7050630"," Maybe a million people over the course of a week or two?"
"7050970","7052550"," Probably now 500,000. "
"7052990","7056930"," We're not even talking about anyone repeating this to somebody else and getting in front of their"
"7056930","7057210"," eyes."
"7057770","7062230"," Maybe now we've hit two or three million people over the course of a week, believe it or not."
"7062750","7064330"," We've at least heard of this ticker. "
"7065230","7066410"," So what happens, right?"
"7067230","7068770"," The underlying goes up slightly."
"7069650","7070990"," How much do I need to make of that?"
"7071790","7072270"," 100%."
"7072270","7074450"," That's a million, right?"
"7075710","7077790"," They talk about the option, the unusual flows. "
"7078930","7084790"," Any option goes to 10 cents or it goes from like, you know, like, or from 10 cents to 20"
"7084790","7086070"," cents or 30 cents."
"7087070","7088010"," Big money, right?"
"7088470","7089490"," Start making some serious money."
"7090150","7091150"," So I exit. "
"7091810","7092870"," Tell the admins first."
"7093190","7093670"," I'm exiting."
"7094510","7097410"," The admins tell, or the admins tell the moderators they're exiting. "
"7097410","7101510"," And the moderators tell the Discord members that they're exiting."
"7102350","7105930"," And then people get bearish and all over on Fintuit before you know it."
"7106290","7109610"," You get the rise in that ticker and then the ticker dives, right?"
"7110270","7111450"," And there's always a bag holder. "
"7112690","7113830"," So what is it?"
"7114070","7116030"," It's retailers fucking over each other, right?"
"7117250","7118510"," Take a pump and dump scheme."
"7120250","7123370"," Now, I think it's bad and wrong that that happens."
"7123970","7126210"," It happens to NFTs, happens with crypto. "
"7127910","7130010"," A lot of crypto and NFTs are created for that."
"7131810","7132670"," It's really bad."
"7133190","7134590"," Now, thanks to it all the time, right?"
"7135550","7136670"," Fucking big boys. "
"7137210","7142250"," Fucking Senate does it all day long, but you and I as retailers, coordinating something like that"
"7142250","7143690"," is not the thing to do ever."
"7145430","7146010"," It's wrong."
"7146310","7146770"," It's not cool. "
"7147670","7150730"," It most certainly isn't wrong amongst retailers, but they're everywhere."
"7150730","7152470"," These pumping numbers are all over."
"7156900","7157380"," Yeah. "
"7159560","7161400"," As a stream freeze in the mind, it's not."
"7165030","7165630"," Yeah, that's right."
"7165730","7165930"," Absolutely. "
"7167670","7168210"," That's right."
"7171730","7173030"," What's the fair warning on?"
"7174010","7174450"," Hagerty."
"7174550","7174970"," What are you saying?"
"7178120","7179140"," What's the fair warning?"
"7179320","7179620"," What is that?"
"7181220","7181820"," Hold on. "
"7182000","7183460"," Should I put this out in the background?"
"7188800","7189420"," Come on."
"7189600","7190800"," Make it rain blood, baby."
"7191980","7193700"," Make it rain blood. "
"7196940","7198400"," Go to the depths of hell."
"7203700","7204420"," Yeah, dude."
"7204660","7204880"," Seriously. "
"7206100","7210680"," And they're allowed to do it, but you as a what's really crazy as like, oh, I'm in the wrong."
"7212020","7219620"," What's really crazy is that like, like I think like the Mr. Zach Moore or I think pumping dumpers"
"7219620","7220840"," trying to dump on each other."
"7221600","7224820"," Like retailers trying to do that to each other is disgusting. "
"7226040","7227420"," And those guys shouldn't be in there, right?"
"7227580","7230000"," They should have been my view that they shouldn't be doing what they're doing."
"7231540","7233400"," I wish they went out after though."
"7234420","7240800"," If you watch if you watch unusual flow, it happens more frequently than you think with some really"
"7240800","7243760"," nefarious aboveboard groups, right?"
"7245600","7253660"," So it's like, yeah, you know, there's a website dedicated to like, JPM is like, you guys know, like"
"7253660","7258500"," there's a website dedicated to every time they've nailed all these large banks that do it. "
"7258760","7259540"," They do it all the time."
"7261520","7263120"," They usually don't go after people with money."
"7263300","7265600"," They usually go after retail traders and stuff. "
"7265600","7272980"," Oh, yeah, I've been, I've been long put since yesterday."
"7273140","7285630"," So I'm hoping that I got some"
"7285630","7287710"," monthlies here for two targets."
"7296040","7297900"," Yeah, man, it's gross when they do it. "
"7298340","7300280"," A little bit of squeeze here in the spoos."
"7308380","7313120"," 11.27. This might be it right now for the bears."
"7314540","7317980"," Three minutes left, they're not getting their last red bar. "
"7328380","7334420"," 11.30 right now, or three minutes left until 11.30. Bull's going to try to take this up and"
"7334420","7339500"," trade this box here to 4.38. We made one attempt back here."
"7340000","7341800"," Try one more attempt right now."
"7350760","7352980"," Well, there's another side to this too. "
"7353120","7357120"," It's not just, it's not just guys like that."
"7357300","7360280"," There's not going to name names."
"7360360","7361680"," I can't name names here, man. "
"7361960","7364220"," Because all this stuff is allegedly."
"7364440","7368220"," By the way, everything I said is allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, OK?"
"7371180","7372420"," Because it's still allegedly."
"7374280","7376940"," I can't say exactly who's doing this stuff. "
"7376940","7386920"," Dude, there's, but there are, like, there are, like, research groups of people out there that are"
"7386920","7388280"," like, oh, yeah."
"7388700","7389040"," Hey, buddy."
"7390080","7391740"," On the short side of stuff, right?"
"7391860","7392580"," They do the same thing. "
"7393960","7397100"," And then you, then they, like, have leaked emails and leaked text messages."
"7398180","7402800"," And you find out that for, and these are always the guys that sound like, these are short."
"7405240","7411220"," Short groups of short sellers that are on, like, the social media and stuff. "
"7411940","7413480"," And they make themselves sound like they're smart."
"7413760","7415900"," Like, they send people on investigative missions."
"7416860","7420880"," And then, I don't know if you know this, but, like, sometimes they have, like, email and text"
"7420880","7421220"," leaks. "
"7422520","7424660"," And then you find out they were buying zero-date puts too."
"7424920","7428360"," So it's not like, like, everyone likes to sound smart."
"7428560","7431120"," Then you find out that everyone's buying zero-dates. "
"7432540","7435340"," Like, when they blame retailers, they're like, well, retailers are doing this."
"7435460","7436100"," I'm like, that's not true."
"7436720","7442120"," I'm like, these are fucking people that sound smart doing the same shit. "
"7442260","7445200"," So I like to blame retailers."
"7445480","7446800"," I'm like, that's not, that's not truth."
"7447980","7449520"," And you have, like, email and text leaks. "
"7449820","7454060"," I'm not going to name these groups, but they had a big leak that came out a year or two"
"7454060","7454300"," ago."
"7454940","7458740"," And it was, like, allegedly it was, they were there, their text messages and emails."
"7465540","7469260"," They were like, man, I don't know how much you guys know. "
"7469540","7472400"," Like, they were like, old time."
"7474360","7479720"," So there are people in the marketplace that were, like, convicted of crimes doing this shit."
"7479960","7486520"," And as soon as, these are people, like, convicted, like, a decade ago, two decades ago, you know,"
"7486560","7487440"," like, all old men. "
"7487780","7490220"," Those guys are fucking doing that shit right now in NFTs."
"7490220","7491540"," And, uh, crypto, right?"
"7491860","7492760"," You guys know that, right?"
"7493360","7495600"," Like, they run half the shit that's going on in the background."
"7496560","7498920"," Uh, all the scams that are being run. "
"7499900","7502200"," Like, all these old creepy old traders, man."
"7502780","7508240"," It was, like, a boon when that's, when, like, crypto got, got, like, crypto and NFTs got, like, hot"
"7508240","7508580"," and shit."
"7509040","7510840"," Like, these guys are, like, unregulated. "
"7511340","7513060"," Uh, can't get in trouble with FINRA."
"7513320","7514480"," Can't get in trouble with SCC."
"7514740","7516820"," SCC is not so bad, but, like, FINRA. "
"7517020","7517900"," Can't get in trouble with FINRA."
"7518840","7520720"," Well, we got in the squeeze play coming up."
"7525700","7527440"," Hello, right here. "
"7527440","7537930"," 4.39"
"7537930","7540030"," C's are 27 cents."
"7553050","7556230"," Uh, long, uh, 4.39 C right now."
"7581680","7583200"," Let's check the five minute. "
"7589980","7591840"," You guys want to snapshot that you can."
"7597760","7599300"," Two places to get above."
"7600040","7602400"," Uh, 440 S3 over here. "
"7603100","7604620"," Uh, your target to the upside."
"7606640","7608980"," You got opening price as well."
"7609140","7609760"," We'll add those in. "
"7627920","7631240"," Be careful these sellers on this five-minute, we'll try to come in and sell this."
"7633020","7635840"," We already tagged that one earlier, so we're done with that one."
"7636540","7637340"," Done with this one. "
"7643520","7644280"," Sellers there."
"7648040","7649600"," Sellers right there."
"7654780","7655960"," Sellers right there. "
"7661610","7689300"," These guys right here have a"
"7689300","7691580"," zero-date trade on right now."
"7692940","7693940"," Still in monthly puts."
"7694980","7705570"," I got 4.32s and, uh, 4.20s. Let's"
"7705570","7706770"," see if we can trade this up here. "
"7719080","7720440"," These guys are a little bit."
"7720760","7721960"," These guys are right here."
"7728790","7732210"," Have some 4.39 C's on, uh, day trade to the upside. "
"7734630","7738070"," Uh, target is right at 4.37, uh, 96."
"7752520","7755780"," I don't know if we can get to 4.39. That's a big move."
"7764170","7767770"," Uh, so for me, the trade goes like this. "
"7768230","7770950"," Uh, the trade should come up here and ricochet."
"7772170","7773730"," Let's see, Sellers step back in."
"7774130","7775690"," There's a second trade in here. "
"7777390","7778090"," Right there."
"7778950","7781990"," Uh, if you want to take the second trade, you wait until here."
"7784650","7786570"," It should take the second leg of that trade. "
"7786570","7809740"," If you're just"
"7809740","7814940"," joining us, we have a room in discord created called the Zach Morris bottom collar."
"7815760","7818840"," I'll send you a hundred crisp hundred dollar bill, I think."
"7819860","7820860"," Or a bunch of 20s. "
"7821880","7823240"," Whatever the bank gives me."
"7823600","7824400"," I don't have any cash anymore."
"7826020","7830120"," I'm going to send you a Mr. Zach Morris, uh, uh, figurine. "
"7830640","7833220"," You can put it on your Christmas tree."
"7836000","7839800"," You know what I should do is buy like a hundred dollars worth of gold or a thousand dollars worth"
"7839800","7840540"," of gold or something."
"7841480","7845920"," Put the gold inside the ornament and tell you to not spend it for the next 20 years. "
"7847540","7850820"," Yeah, these are only trading 30 cents right now."
"7850880","7851700"," They're not giving me any money."
"7852320","7853520"," Give me one more green bar to the upside. "
"7858610","7860010"," Give me one more green bar up there."
"7862170","7863430"," Squeeze them out just one more time."
"7863430","7864910"," Take it to 438 for me at least. "
"7865490","7867230"," Please give me a few pennies on this trade."
"7870290","7872210"," Get ready to sell by the way."
"7873070","7873690"," Not yet. "
"7874170","7874570"," Don't sell you."
"7874710","7876150"," I shouldn't say that."
"7877350","7878570"," Not financial advice. "
"7884290","7885170"," 32 cents."
"7887390","7888210"," Come on, baby."
"7889950","7891190"," Give me some free money. "
"7891190","7892990"," 33 cents per minute."
"7893010","7894430"," Oh, come on, dude."
"7895490","7896730"," Fucking dealers, dude. "
"7896890","7897170"," Seriously?"
"7907000","7910880"," All right, I've got, I'm not going to mention what I've got here, but I've got a hand."
"7911060","7912560"," I've got, I've put a cell in."
"7912740","7914680"," So see if it fills the piece. "
"7914920","7916140"," If we squeeze that parent, it sells."
"7930040","7932020"," Sellers are like, get fucked, Kathy."
"7932880","7934440"," We're not done going down. "
"7936240","7937940"," We aren't done going down, but."
"7947490","7948610"," Still long right now."
"7949410","7950250"," Still no fill. "
"7972650","7973790"," Hey, how's all you doing?"
"7976740","7977920"," I appreciate it, brother."
"7980440","7983320"," Yeah, that's what I, this is a contra long to."
"7984560","7987180"," It's not, I don't think you get the full relief rally here. "
"7987720","7991460"," I think you get another rejection off of the hourly above."
"7992660","7997700"," And it could just trade sideways and then down to hit the daily tomorrow and then you get the trade"
"7997700","7998360"," up to the hourly."
"7999660","8002220"," Like Monday, Friday, Monday or something like that. "
"8003400","8004640"," Then we continue down."
"8004900","8009960"," If you are a bull that thinks that this is the bottom."
"8010900","8014180"," You're going to want to see hourly. "
"8014640","8019680"," You want to see price above the hourly and recheck the hourly, not like two bounces."
"8019680","8025040"," You need to see like recheck it and move higher for this, for this correction to be over."
"8025500","8027120"," You have a lot of work to do here bull. "
"8030800","8034540"," My thesis is we're getting, we're going to get a major correction, not major, but."
"8035120","8038440"," I don't know what you think major is, but I think it's around 420."
"8053020","8054200"," That probably takes. "
"8055760","8057880"," Into mid month for that to happen."
"8058720","8062400"," It's going to take 15th, 19th, 20th somewhere in there."
"8063360","8067140"," So within that time frame of today's July 6th. "
"8067980","8074740"," You'll likely get two decent moves higher and then one one solid relief rally."
"8078580","8079620"," They're not going to give it."
"8079680","8081960"," It's not going to be like you're not getting 420 today. "
"8082140","8082860"," I don't think you are."
"8083480","8084800"," I think it's going to take time."
"8085400","8085840"," So. "
"8092210","8093190"," I love your hustle."
"8093270","8094530"," Thanks for saying something this morning, brother."
"8095330","8098610"," Yeah, you watch Wolf of Wall Street again, realize they were after him personally. "
"8099950","8101490"," The deal was he had to leave the firm."
"8101610","8102250"," The firm would stay."
"8102590","8102630"," Yeah. "
"8105190","8106790"," I may get why people do it."
"8107270","8107690"," I understand."
"8108410","8110050"," It's like I get why it happens. "
"8112050","8112930"," If I was."
"8115170","8116490"," If I was a."
"8122220","8124840"," If I didn't have a wife and kids and I was young."
"8126600","8128160"," And I had nothing to lose. "
"8129340","8131680"," I might be tempted to do something like that."
"8132820","8135300"," But for where I am in my life, I'm too old."
"8136480","8138800"," I've got too many commitments in my life. "
"8139580","8141340"," I can't let people down."
"8142060","8144640"," It's like I can't fail for my family."
"8146100","8148680"," So like that's one major thing for me is. "
"8149560","8151060"," I'm not that person."
"8153720","8159220"," But I understand the I understand like the I get the idea of it."
"8159360","8160980"," Like I get why people do it. "
"8163420","8167500"," But like you like wife kids do like I can't go to prison."
"8168240","8169820"," I'm never going to fuck with FINRA."
"8170020","8170180"," So. "
"8172880","8174160"," Not fucking happening."
"8176200","8177220"," Oh, what was that?"
"8177320","8178760"," What was that?"
"8181280","8183220"," Oh, I think they just flinched."
"8185100","8187440"," I think sellers might have just flinched there. "
"8189540","8191299"," You see that turn around right there?"
"8191580","8194080"," Either flinched or they're like max short right now."
"8194680","8195459"," Send it lower."
"8200580","8203879"," Yeah, Rivian, I'm some extremely bullish and Rivian. "
"8205080","8206260"," I'm way bored."
"8206520","8208000"," I want you guys to understand this."
"8208160","8210700"," On a higher time frame, I'm extremely fucking bullish. "
"8211559","8213780"," This is like your time to be looking for a dip to buy."
"8214840","8217820"," If you have a chance to buy Rivian, if you have a chance to buy Tesla, if you have a"
"8217820","8219379"," chance to buy whatever."
"8219840","8223260"," Like for me, I'm looking for that juicy, juicy dip buy. "
"8223260","8230680"," My viewpoint to the market here is we're going higher for longer, whether you know it or not."
"8231440","8232920"," It's not what you think it is."
"8233480","8236959"," Just an opportunity to cool the market off for us to go higher. "
"8237139","8242559"," So if you're looking for that, like if you're looking for that nine month call on Rivian or AMC,"
"8243280","8244420"," GMA, you can name it."
"8246940","8247600"," We're there."
"8248280","8250540"," Like we're going. "
"8250540","8256020"," We're either going to fail all-time highs or we're getting all-time highs."
"8256600","8259920"," And dude, there is a trade to 6,000."
"8260360","8262740"," You might not see it, but I fucking see it. "
"8263559","8264959"," Like I can see that trade too."
"8265379","8268600"," So it depends on how long the cycle lasts."
"8269540","8274080"," If this cycle lasts nine months a year, that would be the bottom end of this trade. "
"8275200","8277340"," But this trade could easily last two or three years."
"8278240","8285420"," If that's the case, you will see, you'll see attempts at 5,000, you will."
"8286540","8287559"," I see the point. "
"8288580","8289740"," I see it there."
"8291000","8293900"," I see that there more than I see crash right now."
"8296820","8299059"," If I start seeing crash at any point, I'll let you know. "
"8299320","8300520"," I'll always be honest with you."
"8300559","8302379"," If I see it, I'll let you guys know."
"8302520","8303860"," And the work that it takes to get there. "
"8306240","8307920"," You don't need to call it."
"8308020","8310040"," You just need to be there when it happens."
"8310959","8311559"," And present. "
"8313680","8315500"," There's no need to call crashes."
"8315920","8321820"," There's like anyone out there that tells you, do these guys call crashes like fucking every fucking"
"8321820","8322100"," week?"
"8323000","8325180"," You would be insolvent at this point."
"8326480","8327480"," You get what I'm saying?"
"8328379","8332180"," Like listen to me closely as an investor and as a trader, even sell side. "
"8333040","8334540"," You'd be fucking insolvent."
"8335780","8337620"," Like you guys were like, that guy called it."
"8337620","8340120"," I'm like, that fucking guy called it 18 fucking times. "
"8340780","8345959"," Like 20 fucking times, 100 fucking times, 3,000 times that guy's called it."
"8346040","8350620"," You'd be fucking broke if that guy called it every time and you traded that."
"8351360","8358420"," I've lost, I've lost probably $300,000 at this point following those fucking guys years ago. "
"8358639","8359260"," Don't do that shit."
"8359700","8361180"," Just don't fucking do it."
"8363920","8367379"," When we are crashing, you'll know it's we're crashing. "
"8367799","8369480"," I'll show it to you."
"8369620","8370040"," This is a crash."
"8370520","8370959"," We're going to crash. "
"8372020","8373200"," Position yourself for a crash."
"8373879","8374160"," Strap in."
"8374700","8375299"," Put the seat belt on. "
"8376280","8376379"," Oh."
"8377600","8377920"," Oh."
"8379480","8380299"," And I'm out. "
"8381959","8382500"," I'm flat."
"8384799","8384900"," Oh."
"8386799","8387360"," Oh. "
"8387360","8387800"," Oh."
"8392700","8393940"," They flinched."
"8395700","8399870"," There you go. "
"8402660","8404520"," Five minute trade on the spy."
"8405620","8406220"," Patience."
"8407400","8410200"," Now what's the next thing you're looking for?"
"8412480","8413780"," What are you looking for now?"
"8414140","8414460"," Tell me. "
"8415160","8416640"," In the chat, what are you looking for?"
"8418460","8422020"," If you want to take a second trade."
"8425240","8426340"," Oh, yeah, that's right."
"8426480","8427400"," You tagged it, big boys. "
"8431600","8433340"," What are you looking for for the second trade?"
"8434260","8437240"," Well, hopefully you're not long anymore, but maybe you are."
"8438440","8439240"," You can be."
"8442720","8443600"," Oh, baby. "
"8444580","8446220"," This one right here was it."
"8447600","8449120"," I was knocked right out like whoop."
"8449120","8450500"," Took the money and run. "
"8451060","8451540"," Oh."
"8453660","8454260"," Oh."
"8455240","8455400"," Oh. "
"8455400","8458380"," A little bit of liquidity grab right there."
"8458540","8459080"," Oh, look at that."
"8459240","8459340"," Oh. "
"8460140","8463200"," 439 C is trading 36 cents right now."
"8464340","8468500"," So just right in here, what you're looking for is voice of reason."
"8475320","8477660"," You want to see green bars. "
"8479180","8479780"," Bam."
"8480080","8480440"," Bam."
"8480960","8481120"," Bam. "
"8481120","8483160"," They're going to try to sell this."
"8483360","8483820"," I'll show you."
"8483940","8485000"," They rate their pissed right now. "
"8485700","8488300"," But you prepare yourself for a trade here to go higher."
"8489300","8491080"," Don't get caught in this bullshit up in here."
"8491980","8493060"," This is where it gets gnarly. "
"8494380","8498540"," But the break above is like, it's like pure burr."
"8499440","8501320"," So we'll look at a five minute chart real quick."
"8502460","8502980"," You see it?"
"8503500","8505240"," Price is now breaking above. "
"8505240","8509620"," Of the five minute twenty seven EMA."
"8509840","8510540"," This makes us bullish."
"8511320","8511900"," Not right now. "
"8512560","8514340"," You take the money and run on this bar."
"8515620","8518060"," And you're going to look for a reversal bar here."
"8518240","8519200"," It's red, not green. "
"8521920","8522940"," Sometimes you don't get it."
"8523100","8526040"," But you want to see like a five minute red bar here."
"8527140","8527840"," Maybe two. "
"8529060","8532400"," But you prepare yourself for a move higher is the point here."
"8532400","8538040"," And you look for confirmation of higher to 440."
"8539080","8540820"," And you look for one or two. "
"8541100","8542060"," Just be patient here."
"8543060","8545200"," You'll see this one green bar come up."
"8545960","8550020"," And you're going to grab that one right there like the confirmation trade. "
"8550680","8552700"," And that bad boy will rip us like this."
"8553760","8554880"," Straight moonage."
"8560270","8564050"," So we're going to pay attention to right where we are right here. "
"8564050","8565650"," We're going to put it on a one minute chart."
"8566470","8567110"," Check it."
"8567210","8567850"," See it right there?"
"8569230","8570210"," Here comes right here. "
"8577420","8579240"," See that six crossing over right now?"
"8579280","8580040"," It's all hot and spicy."
"8590870","8592510"," I'm along with you again by the way."
"8594770","8595890"," We'll put some risk on. "
"8599790","8601990"," Take some risk here in this trade up here."
"8603230","8603990"," It's right there."
"8604110","8604430"," You see it?"
"8605890","8608890"," At one, two, three, four, five, six. "
"8617130","8618290"," Let's see if it holds."
"8619550","8621590"," It stops below this white line right here."
"8626950","8629650"," It still slides like oh shit. "
"8630930","8637340"," Got PT one now."
"8637720","8637900"," Hold on."
"8640260","8641580"," PT one. "
"8645500","8646400"," Right here."
"8650870","8652010"," PT two."
"8652950","8654830"," Can the bulls get up there?"
"8658960","8660160"," PT three. "
"8665750","8667010"," Oh yeah baby."
"8667610","8668350"," Oh fuck yeah."
"8672150","8673430"," Probably a little bit lower. "
"8673810","8674490"," Probably like right here."
"8676010","8677830"," These guys are fucking savages."
"8682050","8684070"," Well how it's like somewhere right here. "
"8685750","8689400"," PT four right there."
"8690080","8691080"," I don't think you get the four."
"8692600","8693600"," Highly unlikely. "
"8698360","8700740"," Move these over and see if they can do it."
"8702400","8707380"," Three four."
"8708820","8713620"," If at any point price breaks below the five minutes. "
"8716100","8717860"," All of these become invalid."
"8721040","8722880"," And I mean break below."
"8725240","8728360"," Not like a, I'm sure. "
"8731140","8734360"," I don't mean like dip your wick down here."
"8734600","8735500"," Liquidity break shit."
"8736540","8738930"," I mean red bars below closing. "
"8738930","8740590"," A closing red bar."
"8741130","8743370"," A closing red bar is anything that can crap."
"8744330","8747850"," A closing red bars in the trade will be invalid to the upside. "
"8750510","8759570"," So that would mean that the bar starts below 437.98 and closes below 437.98. So I'm going to"
"8759570","8760910"," keep her eyes right here on this."
"8761750","8764530"," I'm going to delete this just so I can keep my eyes on this."
"8765330","8766370"," I'm going to show it to you right now. "
"8768030","8769750"," If there's a closing bar."
"8770610","8772690"," I can do this."
"8777110","8777830"," Come on. "
"8781130","8782170"," That's not going to work."
"8785810","8789450"," Like we don't want to see closing red bars underneath this white line."
"8790330","8794910"," And closing red bars underneath that yellow line. "
"8795050","8797530"," If we see any closing like closing bars, they start below it."
"8798630","8800570"," That one right there, something like that."
"8801250","8802310"," Anything like that. "
"8803030","8804250"," No fucking bueno."
"8804470","8805670"," That means these sellers are here."
"8806470","8813650"," And they're going to take this down and tag 436.40. So be very wary in here. "
"8813870","8814050"," I'm long."
"8814290","8814690"," Some calls."
"8814790","8817270"," I got some shit tickets on right now just to see. "
"8827270","8828670"," What I don't want is closing."
"8829370","8830510"," I'm long right now."
"8830610","8830730"," Calls. "
"8831090","8833330"," Look at that big reversal right there."
"8834570","8836230"," Look at that big fucking reversal."
"8836230","8838610"," Remember what I just said, closing red bars. "
"8839590","8842270"," See that just turned green from quick moment right there."
"8844730","8846190"," See that bad boy right there?"
"8846350","8846630"," Look at that."
"8847030","8848110"," See that fucking shit. "
"8848610","8849290"," They were just like."
"8854660","8855640"," See that quick."
"8855860","8857740"," I'm standing on the five minute because I know you're panicking. "
"8857980","8858620"," I'm on the five."
"8859240","8860740"," I know you guys are panicking out there."
"8861480","8862340"," I know you guys are sweating. "
"8865600","8868060"," I put it on the five because they didn't want to panic you."
"8872200","8873540"," I know how this used to go."
"8873640","8874920"," You see that on stream people would be like. "
"8876160","8876920"," I fucking closed."
"8877400","8877700"," I'm fucked."
"8878180","8880580"," And then it goes all the way up and they're like God damn it. "
"8882140","8884160"," So I'm like we're trading a five minute chart now."
"8885360","8886960"," You guys are always panicking."
"8889720","8891280"," So yeah, we're on a five minute chart here. "
"8908620","8911280"," One bar ticks like put you on the seconds."
"8911280","8912960"," You guys want to watch the second chart with me?"
"8920850","8927110"," Yeah, we're not I'm not trading one one minute charts you guys."
"8927110","8927970"," You guys are savages. "
"8929330","8935930"," Hey, what's going on?"
"8936010","8936230"," Biggie."
"8936250","8936730"," How you doing brother?"
"8937850","8938610"," John Hagerty."
"8938610","8939170"," How you doing brother?"
"8940030","8943090"," Yeah, I like the half back trade. "
"8943790","8946110"," My thoughts on PayPal are the same as every other ticker."
"8946570","8948450"," So I want to be clear in something here."
"8949330","8952770"," When the market is correcting, it affects most of the market. "
"8954410","8956510"," Though this is a good day to be looking around."
"8956730","8957170"," Let me check it."
"8957290","8958410"," Let me check out some stuff for you. "
"8959170","8962770"," So my my same thing as I said this on Twitter."
"8964130","8966670"," I said you're like going to get another gap up."
"8966670","8967210"," We did right. "
"8967210","8971330"," We rolled back up higher, rechecked the high, began rolling over on the fifth."
"8972090","8974770"," That was your time to take a short in the market."
"8975830","8977270"," I said sell July 5th. "
"8978010","8980650"," I don't care what you're in, sell July 5th."
"8980790","8984690"," If you're already in something long at the end of the year, then you don't even look at it."
"8985550","8986950"," You should be positioned at the right place. "
"8987770","8988570"," We're having a correction."
"8989570","8990770"," We're going to rebalance."
"8992150","8995790"," We're going to find a bottom to trade for Q3. "
"8997070","8998350"," As far as I know here."
"8999190","9004390"," So if you're like asking me about like the greater market, it's just a matter of finding a place to"
"9004390","9005770"," buy a bottom that's good for you."
"9006070","9011310"," If you want to take PayPal for September or the first of the year, you want to grab a leap"
"9011310","9014190"," or something, then this doesn't matter to you as much does it. "
"9014890","9016450"," Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't."
"9017710","9024630"," Earlier in the show this morning, I reviewed specifically the correction, what to look for."
"9024630","9025930"," We're going to buy a bottom. "
"9026370","9030230"," And between now and the 19th and 21st, you're going to find that."
"9030630","9034150"," You're also going to find, as Hagerty just said, a couple half back trades."
"9034690","9038750"," You're going to find one relief rally as we go down there. "
"9038850","9040670"," Unless that proves myself otherwise."
"9041270","9047930"," If you're a bull trying to buy a bottom, you have no business buying a bottom until price is above"
"9047930","9052290"," the hourly trigger and has confirmed the trade higher on the hourly trigger."
"9052290","9054330"," An hourly trigger can be down at the weekly. "
"9054590","9055290"," It can be down at the daily."
"9055450","9056530"," It can be right where it is right now."
"9056850","9060730"," You have no business buying a bottom for the next month or two until that happens. "
"9061210","9062230"," Unless you're day trading."
"9068010","9072110"," So you got to say unless you're like inter-day trading, something like that, you've got no"
"9072110","9072510"," business."
"9072970","9073430"," Does that make sense?"
"9074850","9076090"," We have to go over this. "
"9076090","9081790"," I have to do a video specifically that will record for new traders that join us so they know"
"9081790","9085930"," exactly where you're actually buying a bottom."
"9086990","9090670"," When you can buy a bottom with safety, there's a reason for this."
"9091490","9093450"," You need to have safety in your trades. "
"9093970","9095770"," You have to have a high probability win rate."
"9096310","9102610"," I don't care if you grab the one minute tick on the absolute bottom of any correction."
"9102610","9107230"," I don't care because I already know that you fucking lose. "
"9108050","9110410"," I already know that you fucking have a job."
"9110910","9112370"," I already know that you're not rich."
"9113050","9114470"," I already know that you don't make money. "
"9115150","9118090"," The same goes for sellers as bottom buyers."
"9118390","9123290"," So if you're looking for a bottom to buy on any fucking tip, not any, but the market in general"
"9123290","9131990"," right now."
"9133110","9135070"," Now this hourly trigger can be down. "
"9135310","9136870"," It can be right where it is right now."
"9137170","9138330"," It can be down on the daily."
"9138790","9139810"," It can be down on the weekly. "
"9140890","9147050"," Until price gets above that hourly trigger, you have no place to actually buy the dip."
"9147530","9149930"," Now you're going to always have a voice out there."
"9150910","9153150"," You're always going to have a voice. "
"9153370","9154390"," I want you to know this."
"9154490","9160210"," If you're out there in social media land and you're like, well that guy called the bottom."
"9161010","9163790"," There's always that guy calling the fucking bottom. "
"9164410","9165690"," It's always someone different."
"9166510","9168370"," And one guy did buy that bottom."
"9169290","9170350"," But the other guy disappeared. "
"9171890","9177510"," So for you as an investor in a trader or even sell side, you need some confirmation."
"9179590","9181570"," You have to, not them."
"9181870","9182490"," Fuck those guys. "
"9184850","9187350"," You have to always be a winning trader."
"9188150","9191130"," Or as high a chance as you can get it."
"9191770","9195210"," If that's 60% of the time 70, 80, 90 or 100. "
"9196490","9198590"," So you need to see certain things."
"9201130","9202150"," I'm not a furu."
"9203490","9209230"," I'm the guy trying to teach you how to be responsible to make money every day. "
"9210210","9212330"," Make money every week, every month and every year."
"9213190","9213930"," Just sustain yourself."
"9214490","9214970"," That's why I'm here. "
"9214970","9217030"," That's why I started this whole entire thing."
"9219090","9221390"," So you need to see certain things happen."
"9222290","9225170"," So an example would be right now, this hourly trigger. "
"9225890","9227630"," You literally need to see."
"9228670","9238210"," Price go literally above and confirm twice and then begin to make it way higher"
"9238210","9239670"," to even put a trade on."
"9239990","9243310"," Now you might think, let's just say we did this. "
"9243310","9245890"," You might think, oh, well, Captain didn't call the bottom."
"9247310","9254070"," I assure you that if you're down here buying these things permanently, like, hey, can I get long in"
"9254070","9254590"," this ticker?"
"9255270","9256510"," Can I buy Tesla here?"
"9258030","9260730"," I can assure you that you will fucking lose."
"9261650","9262850"," That you will have a fucking job. "
"9263290","9265010"," You will never, ever make money."
"9266050","9272650"," If you don't follow these fucking rules, you might make money for a month or three months or six"
"9272650","9274330"," months or even a year."
"9274790","9276370"," But you won't fucking do it for 20 years. "
"9277870","9278930"," You won't be able to buy property."
"9279910","9282570"," You won't be able to buy a fucking car whenever you feel like it with cash."
"9285870","9289370"," I assure you, you won't be able to take any of the trips you want to take. "
"9292150","9295850"," So I don't care where this green, where this early trigger is."
"9297070","9299570"," I care about price being above it."
"9299570","9304770"," If that early trigger is down the daily, if that early trigger is down on the weekly, if that early"
"9304770","9308070"," trigger is higher, you have no fucking trade. "
"9308490","9308770"," What do you do?"
"9308870","9309450"," You have zero dates."
"9310030","9315790"," But you have no business being like, I'm going to buy 30K in Tesla calls to the fucking moon."
"9318230","9326650"," If the greater market is correcting itself, you have to ensure that the correction is over. "
"9326650","9328150"," You have to."
"9328570","9331850"," And you do not have to be the bottom collar or the top collar."
"9332750","9333990"," That's none of your business. "
"9336330","9339050"," Your business is, do we get above this?"
"9341510","9342470"," I'm going to show you something else."
"9350750","9351990"," I'm going to show you why."
"9353090","9363310"," On a higher time frame, you can"
"9363310","9364750"," trade a relief rally in here. "
"9365150","9366370"," I'm going to trade right now, relief rally."
"9368470","9369970"," Do you see what they did here?"
"9370650","9371990"," They sold it down on you."
"9372090","9372830"," They sold it down. "
"9372990","9374590"," Every time you got up there, they sold it down."
"9375210","9375730"," You see it?"
"9375870","9376210"," Can't you hear?"
"9376310","9376870"," They sell it down."
"9377030","9382110"," You sell it down and you sell it down, sell it down, sell it down, sell it down, sell it"
"9382110","9382210"," down. "
"9382650","9383530"," See this right here?"
"9384810","9386150"," You know what they want to do to you?"
"9386370","9387730"," They want to sell it down on you."
"9388490","9390010"," They want to sell it down on you."
"9390110","9390570"," Do you see it?"
"9392330","9394670"," So you have to be above that green line. "
"9394670","9395650"," do you see that right there?"
"9396310","9397850"," That's your trade as a bull."
"9399210","9400990"," That's your confidence trade right there."
"9402110","9403530"," You don't have that right now right?"
"9404090","9406350"," I mean you got the daily down here this is kind of helping you. "
"9406690","9407810"," This looks good for you as a bull."
"9408290","9408710"," I like that."
"9409350","9414630"," But you need to be above this green and you have checked it to make sure that we're going higher. "
"9414910","9416030"," That's your trade for the market."
"9418010","9418910"," We're gonna look at the queues."
"9424440","9426600"," Are you above the hourly trigger?"
"9427980","9428420"," No. "
"9429420","9430980"," Do you get a relief rally out of here?"
"9431100","9431480"," Fuck yeah."
"9432560","9435460"," Are you supposed to be the one person down here buying this?"
"9435820","9436540"," Fuck no."
"9438760","9440680"," You buy this one right here. "
"9441480","9443380"," You know the money is right there."
"9443520","9443860"," That's where the money."
"9443960","9444980"," Watch my car's right fucking there. "
"9445060","9445560"," That's the money."
"9446060","9447340"," This isn't the money trade."
"9447980","9450340"," This is like a little bit of like zero day trade. "
"9451040","9452480"," That's a little bit of zero day trade."
"9452980","9455920"," But you don't need to buy this and I'm gonna explain why right now."
"9457060","9462020"," Because here's that same trade over here and you like yeah that's it. "
"9462240","9463020"," It's setting itself up."
"9463140","9463980"," Well it wasn't was it."
"9464100","9464600"," So you lose. "
"9465080","9466160"," You lose there."
"9466460","9467360"," You lose there."
"9467820","9468600"," You lose there. "
"9469000","9471240"," You lose up here because didn't confirm right?"
"9471800","9472860"," Starts to go higher."
"9474380","9475480"," A check a recheck."
"9476980","9479040"," Right you have to be that person. "
"9479900","9480640"," You must."
"9480980","9482180"," You cannot be the person."
"9482900","9487060"," I get that it's showed here but you need to see the proof of it. "
"9488980","9489840"," You have to."
"9490540","9491140"," This is the queues."
"9492160","9492780"," Do you want to buy this?"
"9492960","9494560"," Fuck yeah you put some zero dates on here. "
"9495100","9496700"," Fuck yeah put some zero date calls here."
"9497540","9498280"," All day long."
"9498660","9499120"," Take that trade. "
"9500180","9502580"," But if you want like what do I think about tech right now?"
"9504680","9506100"," I want to fucking see."
"9508980","9510900"," Green fucking bars go over."
"9512040","9513340"," Yeah you don't get that money. "
"9513640","9514760"," You get it maybe in zero dates."
"9515640","9517100"," But you ain't putting your account on that."
"9517800","9519200"," At any moment this can sell. "
"9520320","9522320"," I want to see like the check back here."
"9523220","9523700"," Boom."
"9524580","9525320"," We confirmed it. "
"9525440","9526540"," We're now moving higher."
"9527860","9529500"," Then you want to talk about your favorite ticker."
"9529680","9531240"," Fuck yeah we'll talk about your favorite ticker. "
"9531280","9532180"," We'll put some monthly's on."
"9532360","9532780"," Some weeklies."
"9533460","9535080"," All that kind of stuff right in there. "
"9536220","9537740"," So you got days ahead of you."
"9544100","9545920"," It's like what do I think about these tickers?"
"9547160","9549740"," Zero dates of the game right here for bulls."
"9551360","9552880"," Do you have a trade as a bull?"
"9553080","9556120"," Call them this the bottom for July. "
"9556640","9557300"," No you don't."
"9559720","9561120"," You don't have that trade yet."
"9569380","9570300"," You don't have it. "
"9570400","9571780"," Well I mean sweet."
"9573320","9574940"," I'm in some calls right now."
"9575040","9575700"," Zero date calls. "
"9576140","9577880"," But the move is not for the bulls."
"9577900","9579340"," I got to warn you of this guys."
"9580020","9581900"," If you're a fucking market participant right?"
"9582500","9584300"," There's always a fucking voice. "
"9585200","9587000"," They're always out there going."
"9587140","9587760"," This is the top."
"9587960","9588620"," This is the top. "
"9588800","9589440"," This is the top."
"9589600","9590140"," This is the top."
"9590500","9591920"," There's another voice out there all the time. "
"9592420","9593140"," That was the bottom."
"9593280","9593840"," That was the bottom."
"9593940","9594520"," That was the bottom. "
"9594600","9595060"," That was the bottom."
"9595220","9596300"," And they're fucking always there."
"9597140","9600960"," And that has nothing to do with what you're doing. "
"9602580","9602940"," Nothing."
"9605900","9607380"," Nothing to do with what you're doing."
"9610650","9612550"," There is high risk in here. "
"9613070","9614070"," Can we trade this up?"
"9614270","9614610"," Fuck yeah."
"9614610","9621550"," There are sellers just waiting to destroy your account in here."
"9622110","9622670"," That's the truth. "
"9626820","9628200"," They're up here waiting for you."
"9629380","9630520"," They're like come on up."
"9630640","9630940"," Let's go. "
"9633140","9634900"," So yeah you can do zero dates here."
"9635680","9637880"," But we are still in a sell environment."
"9639600","9642120"," And for you to be like I'm gonna go long Tesla. "
"9642460","9643360"," I'm gonna go long PayPal."
"9644060","9645620"," I'm gonna go long this tick or whatever."
"9645840","9646460"," I mean like long. "
"9646760","9647360"," Like we're going long."
"9649000","9651100"," You need to be above that fucking hourly trigger."
"9651260","9651940"," The moment we are. "
"9652940","9654100"," Could take half a day."
"9654580","9655320"," The moment we are."
"9656480","9657920"," I'm fucking long with you. "
"9658180","9659680"," We'll go where we're going there together."
"9661380","9662260"," With no fear."
"9663480","9666120"," And I'll make fun of bears on fin to it. "
"9666180","9666600"," That's what I do."
"9667480","9668540"," Get on fucking fin to it."
"9668620","9670780"," And I'm like you're about to get fucked up here. "
"9671740","9672760"," And they don't believe me."
"9672780","9673960"," I'm like okay wait and see."
"9674600","9675220"," And they do. "
"9675340","9675880"," They get fucked up."
"9676780","9677420"," They get wrecked."
"9678380","9680140"," Trading $0.39 right now. "
"9680360","9684700"," $0.40 on $0.49. Yes."
"9687060","9690520"," So this isn't actually your bottom if you're a bull."
"9690700","9692040"," You think this is but it's not. "
"9692740","9693840"," Your bottom is higher."
"9694220","9700560"," And the reason I say this to you guys out there is because you need high probability trades every"
"9700560","9700980"," time."
"9701720","9702860"," Not half the time. "
"9703600","9704960"," Not 30% of the time."
"9705580","9707040"," Not 20% of the time."
"9707740","9709020"," Not that one home run. "
"9709840","9712720"," You guys need like boom every time."
"9713060","9713800"," Boom every time."
"9714120","9714820"," Boom every time. "
"9716260","9718400"," Someone out there's telling you trade sucks."
"9718740","9722200"," You're like oh fuck no I know this one prints every time."
"9723060","9724020"," Nine out of 10. "
"9724720","9726060"," 28 out of 30."
"9729100","9731800"," I know this one prints too but still risky."
"9739530","9740950"," Trading $0.40 right now. "
"9741070","9742170"," $0.49. See."
"9745780","9746460"," Kind of a"
"9746460","9759400"," little bit"
"9759400","9759520"," serious."
"9759620","9761680"," So if you guys don't know this stuff you're just joining me. "
"9762400","9766060"," I need you guys to come back or I need to make a fucking video."
"9766780","9767980"," Maybe we do that this weekend."
"9768280","9769700"," So I took a big long vacation right. "
"9769860","9770540"," How about this weekend."
"9772100","9774980"," We make a we make an actual educational video."
"9776180","9779940"," And we do a video on how do you know if this is the bottom. "
"9782000","9783720"," And how do you know if this is the top."
"9783980","9785780"," We'll do both for buyers and sellers."
"9786740","9792160"," Like how and record it and leave it up as an educational video because you guys need that. "
"9794100","9796120"," I need you guys to be fucking millionaires."
"9796180","9797960"," I need every motherfucker in here to be a millionaire."
"9798880","9799500"," I do. "
"9801180","9807080"," I need to like make a goal here that we turn like every person here into a millionaire by end"
"9807080","9809540"," of the year only taking high probability trades."
"9811040","9816380"," Or maybe we maybe we take those you take those trades and then you take your own trades and we"
"9816380","9819140"," see how you fare versus those trade those trades."
"9819580","9822320"," Those fucking trades are like gold. "
"9823480","9824940"," They're like gold."
"9829330","9830450"," They're gold."
"9830890","9831190"," They're gold. "
"9831490","9836150"," Every single fucking time like every time the probability on these things."
"9836570","9838970"," They're like it's like eighty six percent probability."
"9839870","9841550"," That's how high it is. "
"9845570","9848490"," Truth that I don't care if you're selling buying."
"9848690","9849010"," I don't care."
"9850750","9853830"," And there's some people out there that know that. "
"9854970","9857390"," You ask a guy like James Rowland knows this."
"9858050","9860770"," There's people out there that know how good these trades are."
"9861070","9862470"," There aren't many but there's some. "
"9863250","9864670"," Joe Donut knows how good these are."
"9865370","9871710"," Winky knows how good these things are trading forty three cents right now on four thirty nine sees."
"9876630","9881330"," Look for a little check mark right back here in a few moments on four thirty eight twenty seven. "
"9889630","9895030"," So like where is my dip by right now for the quarter it's it's above the hourly trigger."
"9895770","9898330"," Wherever that hourly trigger is that's where my dip by is."
"9899070","9903470"," Whether it's down on the weekly the daily above where whatever it is that's where it is. "
"9904730","9905850"," Until we get there."
"9906870","9908690"," The answer is fuck you know I'm not long."
"9910510","9913070"," Hell no I know these sellers are here. "
"9921350","9925450"," What's that I usually start with twenty five contracts and add on to them."
"9925730","9930310"," I used to do a like three hundred now I don't now it's like twenty five at another twenty five"
"9930310","9934210"," at another twenty five if I'm correct in direction."
"9934690","9935310"," Good question. "
"9935790","9938530"," Usually trading about a hundred contracts by the end."
"9939090","9941590"," Sometimes if I'm upside down but I have the direction right."
"9942430","9947170"," If I'm like wrong in the trade I can get to like two or three hundred contracts but normally I"
"9947170","9949530"," started twenty five and move higher and higher and higher with zero dates. "
"9950290","9954170"," And then with size I'm usually trading about thirty K somewhere in there about thirty thousand"
"9954170","9956110"," dollars trying to make like a hundred K."
"9958750","9961010"," It's because of the live streaming and all this other stuff."
"9961370","9964670"," I have had to change my entire how I trade."
"9965430","9966810"," Do it to do a live stream every day. "
"9968650","9972050"," Thirty nine cents right now four thirty nine see what we're gonna do a check back right here."
"9972430","9974170"," Check for thirty eight twenty seven."
"9975110","9976470"," We have known sellers right here. "
"9976790","9977950"," You have known sellers right here."
"9978230","9979110"," Known sellers right here."
"9980090","9981950"," They're not going to want to give up this one right here guaranteed. "
"9987900","9990100"," Do I know I don't normally trade."
"9990440","9992640"," I usually put trades of size."
"9993560","10001200"," I usually put anywhere in a year on a on a beer market six to nine trades bull market. "
"10002060","10005960"," I try to put on minimum of nine to twelve."
"10007240","10008500"," There's some that I miss."
"10010780","10012360"," This will be this year. "
"10012900","10019240"," This for the end of this year I'm going to be probably making about as much as I made during"
"10019240","10019780"," covid."
"10019940","10021240"," I'm on track for that this year."
"10022320","10023220"," During the covid years. "
"10024180","10025880"," It's gonna be a very good year this year for me."
"10031170","10034230"," Yeah this is gonna be this is gonna be one of the better years."
"10035130","10040690"," I trade O.T.M. most of the time. "
"10040830","10042330"," No I trade as I'll trade zero."
"10042730","10044570"," Normally I trade zero dates directionally."
"10045090","10046530"," There are thirty deltas somewhere in there. "
"10047050","10050770"," Sometimes if I'm upside down I'll go with a strangle or a straddle."
"10051090","10052170"," Kind of on where we are."
"10053510","10054490"," What else do I do?"
"10055930","10057110"," I trade them directionally. "
"10057290","10060810"," So the moment that the direction is done I usually sell a winner or loser."
"10060990","10063170"," So like right now I won't hold these."
"10063810","10067690"," If we break direction at any point I'll get out and reposition myself. "
"10068570","10071090"," So I'm looking for direction all the time."
"10071670","10072610"," Never like all day long."
"10072850","10073110"," Two days. "
"10073610","10078980"," If I hold zero dates overnight I'm usually selling them on the open regardless of where we go and"
"10078980","10080040"," renegotiate the position."
"10080940","10083120"," Even if we're going higher I'll buy cheaper."
"10083980","10088900"," So let's say I'd buy a call for twenty five cents and we we gap up overnight. "
"10088900","10092920"," Let's say I do it overnight zero day trade and we gap up overnight."
"10093260","10094000"," Let's say I win right."
"10094400","10098620"," It's twenty five cents now they're fifty cents or seventy five cents or a dollar. "
"10099480","10105240"," I will close that position take the money and then buy more twenty five cent calls if I think we're"
"10105240","10106100"," going to continue higher."
"10106880","10111540"," But I realize gains every part of that trade."
"10112820","10114760"," I'm looking for specific things here. "
"10115380","10120560"," Like I'm looking for like right now I'm looking for this trade right here as one trade."
"10121380","10125880"," I'm looking for the confirmation here that we're going higher and I know right now that as long as"
"10125880","10128260"," we test and hold this we're going to continue higher."
"10129520","10130580"," I already know we are. "
"10130780","10134540"," If we break this right here or this right here I know the trade is dead."
"10134780","10135560"," I already know it is."
"10135920","10138900"," So as long as we hold this stuff I'm good to the upside right now. "
"10141340","10142920"," Like like nine out of ten times."
"10144860","10146440"," So that's why I'm watching this right here."
"10146660","10150700"," I want to see we us hold this and confirm that the move is still high the but there's still"
"10150700","10151300"," demand here. "
"10153000","10156520"," The more we break below and have a closing bar I'll exit the trade."
"10157740","10161740"," My highest probability is like highest probability is PT one."
"10162020","10168480"," We tagged it a less probability less probably the lowest policy probability and definitely"
"10168480","10169840"," unexpected as PT four. "
"10174870","10176930"," I got to make a video this weekend with you guys."
"10177690","10184610"," We have to like do like we have to do like a step by step video on what to expect"
"10184610","10187430"," when you're placing trades how how much risk you put on."
"10190010","10193390"," How do you know that you're going the right way in a trade. "
"10194330","10198630"," Where to buy that dip in that trade or even sell."
"10199790","10203730"," Like how do you know we're going to start selling how do you know where the bottom is."
"10206350","10214730"," Why why it's bullshit calling tops and bottoms that price like price action always rules regardless"
"10214730","10218230"," of what you think is going to happen and that you have to be able to shift when it does"
"10218230","10218670"," happen. "
"10219270","10227030"," So like is this the bottom of the correction no likely no the probability is no highly unlikely."
"10228110","10232150"," We're sellers likely going to step in to sell right here."
"10233670","10235910"," This is where a seller wants to sell again right there. "
"10237550","10239190"," When can you get bullish again."
"10239570","10244070"," Everyone thinks it's right here but it's not it's above it's above this and this is a moving"
"10244070","10244370"," target."
"10245100","10255920"," This can be here it can be down here wherever this is matters and it"
"10255920","10263300"," does matter and I'm saying this to you because you want to take a trade with confidence maybe clear"
"10263300","10263840"," on that. "
"10267300","10273180"," Like confidence do you know what confidence is when you buy something and you're like and people"
"10273180","10282780"," are out there publicly telling you that it's going to crash and you know that they're wrong you"
"10282780","10291400"," know that you can actually write something about it and tell them hey you're fucking wrong you suck"
"10291400","10298140"," you have no idea what you're talking about and you're going to fucking lose so when you when you're"
"10298140","10306800"," able to do that publicly it changes things you do know something more than them you do know what"
"10306800","10314380"," the actual bottom is you do know where we're headed you can take that trade and not panic you can"
"10314380","10320440"," literally like smoke a dooby close the laptop and come back in a few days and know you're going"
"10320440","10328320"," there and you even know if your trade is invalid to cut your losses or take your winnings and run"
"10330380","10335700"," so like even if we don't continue up or down you know where to cut you know where to be"
"10335700","10339320"," like yeah I'm taking some money off here you know where I'm going to be like yeah I'm going to"
"10339320","10345360"," leave some runners on you're going to know where to actually enter that trade higher these are your"
"10345360","10351220"," entry points if you're going to sell you know where the sell points this is a sell point right here"
"10351680","10361060"," my cursor right here this is a place to sell right there this is where some sellers are waiting to"
"10361060","10368040"," sell they're right up here sitting up with their 441 here I'll write it down probable bull trap"
"10368040","10376210"," right there I'll write it before you even get there"
"10376210","10390220"," probable bull trap right here we'll see what that does sellers"
"10390220","10395040"," are hiding right well there's some sellers hiding right here too but there's some more sellers"
"10395040","10403100"," right here we'll call them weak sellers they're going to try to enter the trade early they're right"

"12525030","12534750"," we don't do road biking here uh but we do some kind of like mixed paved trail gravel trail uh"
"12534750","12539390"," like you don't want to ride a mountain bike you don't want to ride a road bike but you want"
"12539390","12545510"," like the ability to do all of it and people like on mountain bikes see what we're doing they're"

"12572690","12579710"," trails they're not as good like ojio's better like ojio's got like dedicated rail trail paved for a"
"12579710","12585790"," hundred miles shit like that michigan's like uh we've got we've got five miles of paved trail then"
"12585790","12589350"," you got to go on the road then you have to go on a dirt path then you can like"
"12589350","12596330"," re hook back up on this other paved trail it's like not quite complete um and yet it's not really"
"12596330","12602970"," and the single track is like it's single trackish so like if you really want it in its light like"
"12602970","12607290"," it's a light bike i can load shit up on it and take a day trip on it let me"
"12607290","12613170"," look for some pictures here i fucking got sidetracked bull's trying to make an explosive move to"
"12613170","12622710"," the upside right now bull's trying to be a big squeeze is here so big squeeze here coming up"
"12622710","12632650"," like rip faces off type of a squeeze pretty close dude where's my camera come on now need to send"
"12632650","12641950"," some pictures out i got some cool pictures too oh oh yeah baby trading 439 17 right now"
"12641950","12654840"," big squeeze coming up here give me some of that PT 3 love up here let's"
"12654840","12665210"," get it more exact here there's one right there there's another one right there sell"
"12665210","12679700"," a rage right now come on now baby anally"
"12679700","12689690"," probing right now yeah so if we"
"12689690","12695690"," break above uh so i don't care where the hourly is uh as long as we trade above it and"
"12695690","12704070"," hold it i'll get bullish again my thesis right now is that we're due for a correction um so well"
"12704070","12711450"," then on all likelihood we're not done going down here uh and we do these trades all the time where"
"12711450","12720110"," we trade up and then roll over so my thesis is still sorry let me explain myself on the year"
"12720110","12729290"," i am bullish on the one to three month i am bearish right now"
"12729290","12739050"," we need to pull back historically we get one down to the weekly every three months sometimes"
"12739050","12747530"," it takes four we're there we're ready for it we're we're there right now so in all likelihood uh"
"12747530","12753110"," we're not done going down does that make sense now can i change my viewpoint that we're going up"
"12753110","12760430"," that this is the bottom yes but not until we're above the hourly trigger it was not just above it"
"12760430","12765270"," we have to go above it and then we have to test it twice once or twice and start making"
"12765270","12773650"," our way up then all along the market with size and i still i have puts on right now but"
"12773650","12778970"," they've been on since yesterday in the high so i don't i just want them to keep going keep us"
"12778970","12787030"," keep going down um but um i'm not bullish here on i'm bullish here on the intraday but i'm not"
"12787030","12794550"," bullish here on is this the dip to buy for july yet at all it's like different different time"
"12794550","12802990"," frames uh bullish bearish or buyer star that kind of stuff depends on the time frame uh and all"
"12802990","12813350"," this is based upon probability and statistics so i want to be right as many times as possible good"
"12813350","12822740"," question you're looking for the best place to get puts it's on a rejection uh the best place to get"
"12822740","12833080"," puts somewhere here uh the next buy-in for puts is likely right here and"
"12833080","12836700"," we could break above for a minute down and they'll they'll they'll take it down they're going to"
"12836700","12845860"," try to at least uh sellers are here i know they're here uh you could begin maybe buying some put"
"12845860","12855500"," spreads in here uh my core shoes and hand grenades and how you would know if and this is the"
"12855500","12862200"," other crazy part so if you're a seller you would you would know as a seller that if we break"
"12862200","12868920"," above the early trigger we bounce we bounce and then we start heading higher uh your stops would be"
"12868920","12874100"," on that you know that first or second bounce in here to move higher you'd be like boom i'm letting"
"12874100","12883800"," off letting off the short side of the market because you would get run over at that point um we"
"12883800","12896370"," would close this gap we would get a new high and continue higher either"
"12896370","12903250"," way you'll either way you'll see it well i'll i'll walk you through it so walk you through when"
"12903250","12908530"," we're bullish again when the market is bullish it's weird because we're watching a one in a five"
"12908530","12915350"," minute chart right we're under like this huge microscope and we're looking down on something and"
"12915350","12921710"," oftentimes you'll see people be like well you miss this top or this bottom or this uh you miss you"
"12921710","12927090"," miss something here and it's like well no if we go back and look at like every that's short-term"
"12927090","12934790"," memory loss and then uh what really matters though is that the time afterwards like one day two"
"12934790","12941330"," days three days four days five days how long that trend lasts how long you can stay bullish then"
"12941330","12946670"," when you're no longer bullish then when you're no longer bearish so right now we're bearish until"
"12946670","12952670"," we break above and hold the hourly trigger we are bearish we're in south we're in sell mode no"
"12952670","12957690"," matter what anyone tells you that's what we're in sell mode even now even coming up here we're"
"12957690","12964930"," still in sell mode now we get into buy mode though when we're above and confirm that we're above"
"12964930","12969810"," the hourly trigger and that's when we're in buy mode it's like you buy and just let it go you're"
"12969810","12974950"," like whoo-hoo we're out of here let's go and uh you don't care about what sellers are saying you"
"12974950","12981910"," know we're buying the market so below hourly trigger we're sellers above hourly trigger we're"
"12981910","12989170"," buyers and as long as we're below this seller but below this hourly trigger we're selling off that"
"12989170","12995530"," fucking thing we're gonna sell off it and sell off it and sell off it until we start trading above"
"12995530","13007130"," it then we'll start buying off of it right on"
"13007130","13015950"," right on yeah you can probably try to take them right here so in a five we'll look at a"
"13015950","13025650"," five-minute try real quick so there is an argument to made for um there's an argument to"
"13025650","13033070"," enter here puts here in continuation of the downside you'd see a trap right here a roll and we're"
"13033070","13056170"," sitting in shows too there is an argument to made for like you"
"13056170","13063070"," get the squeeze higher right you get the reject down here and there's a there's a small bull trap"
"13063070","13073330"," here to the downside i don't like these ones though uh i like the the higher target up here these"
"13073330","13078690"," are the ones everybody gets lost in the sirely triggers where sirely triggers where wherever it is"
"13078690","13084330"," is where you get people on social media thinking they know where bottom is or top is it's usually"
"13084330","13089750"," the sirely trigger that they're missing so this is it right here go to close the gap fill the fill"
"13089750","13094590"," i mean i get the failure to close the gap and then we're running down right you have bulls out"

"13114270","13123350"," the one in five that crosses that's a three trigger cluster this actually comes up this white line"
"13123350","13131670"," comes up right here and if you can hold this that's the explosive move you're looking for that's"
"13131670","13136790"," where you get bullish right right about there somewhere that's where you get bullish but you don't"

"13198830","13204830"," all the time if this chart was upside down right now uh this is a three or four this different"
"13204830","13211170"," trades here there's a trade here that's one there's a trade right here that's trade number two"
"13211170","13218890"," there's another trade right here this is trade number three for bulls uh then there's another trade"
"13218890","13228530"," right here this is trade number four so very risky"
"13228530","13235870"," less risky um less risky and you have to be above this too you take the money and run on"
"13235870","13242150"," each one of these trades so you what you end up doing is uh what you end up doing is"
"13242150","13294040"," you take hold on one second here having"
"13294040","13302500"," some technical difficulties here hold on so what you end up doing here is the risk right is always"
"13302500","13309760"," like here the risk is always here once you're up in here you don't"
"13309760","13319760"," have a the consolidation and then the move so maybe i should probably like"
"13319760","13329280"," erase that right there like you're looking for the next leg of the trade right to put on and this"
"13329280","13332280"," one right here you want to see the break above but then you want to see it hold and start"
"13332280","13338720"," to make its way higher you enter the long trade right there if you once you break above the hourly"
"13338720","13345540"," or even to the hourly you take the money off the table and you wait to see what happens if"
"13345540","13350780"," it's an immediate rejection you're not getting taken for a ride if it consolidates then it begins"
"13350780","13356900"," to move higher you take that long trade again you set it up you're waiting to see at certain points"
"13356900","13363800"," right now this number four trade is we're back into bull run again to make sense that number four"
"13363800","13373360"," is bull run again so you can see us squeezing right now right and"
"13373360","13383000"," this trade here is its own trade now sometimes we'll blast above then revert down"
"13383000","13388080"," it's called a kiss trade actually comes back and kisses to confirm if the move is higher or"
"13388080","13396680"," stronger or whatever or lower so this trade is very strong in into this close right here but even"
"13396680","13401800"," so you take your money and run you know that's a good trade let's say we squeeze let's we squeeze"
"13401800","13409100"," all the way up here right and we start to bounce right you don't need this entire trade you just"
"13409100","13415880"," need this last part this the majority of this trade now if we roll under and start to reverse"
"13415880","13423160"," you're going to have a bad time right so you're looking for the consolidation above in the"
"13423160","13431880"," confirmation with this white line here crossing the red line boom boom and you've got another"
"13431880","13438100"," confirmed upside trade so this is where the money part is this is where like the low risk high"
"13438100","13442420"," reward part of the trade is does that make any sense to you don't know if it does or doesn't"
"13442420","13449360"," but there's like the high risk high reward the retests on the six is a five-minute chart by the"
"13449360","13457120"," way to the upside so you want a place to buy put spreads it's probably up here at 440 somewhere"
"13457120","13464480"," in here is the best place so let's say we squeeze up here right all the way up here and"
"13464480","13471720"," you're like being about a put spread right you're actually looking for this move down this reversal"
"13471720","13478580"," so i would set up the put spread right here and i would execute it right here so i'd set"
"13478580","13484360"," the put spread up and then as soon as you see the break here below and the hold below then"
"13484360","13491240"," you know we're getting our second leg to the downside make sense so how about this as we trade this"
"13491240","13498160"," up or roll this over we will look for the place for the next puts for the downside move or"

"13506720","13515000"," area up here if we reverse here if we come up here right now right we break above and it"
"13515000","13522460"," rejects we will add a put spread here so make sense if we break if we hold this boom boom"
