"513570","520549"," have a generator but I'd have to do some kind of like cloud-based stream and then with the"
"520549","525490"," generators that I have that kind of stuff and even another possibility would be to have a second"
"525490","531290"," host that could fill in whatever I'm not here with you so you what you might have another post"
"531290","539230"," something like that so you can see these sellers in book map already this morning right you can and"
"539230","544550"," we should have some volatility to follow volatility this morning you have a gap above that need to"
"544550","552710"," be closed but we've got gaps everywhere these are gaps in and low low volume environments too the"
"552710","560830"," selling off that took place on Thursday all this gap here was low volume environment right then"
"560830","565450"," we've got another gap down below here at the same kind of stuff and they're kind of littering the"
"565450","571690"," chart right now up and down we're not so much down at this point but at least up there's a"
"571690","576550"," bunch that was going on back here as well you can see what you do according to all this nonsense"
"576550","585370"," back here never got filled not showing up on this chart right now and you can see where the sellers"
"585370","591770"," had stepped in on Thursday kind of teed off here teed off here in this close we had that nice"
"591770","599970"," little test down below here and we talked on Thursday about how we have to get above to 410 it's"
"599970","606530"," kind of a required thing after the damage that was done down below on the weekly a monthly triggers"
"606530","614550"," right and we talked about how the Swellers were above here right some Thursday right the Swellers"
"614550","619610"," are up here just trying to sell and then between here and 410 into the 28th that's they're going to"
"619610","625950"," attempt to do now they're going to try to try to sell from above they've got no other choice it's"
"625950","631290"," the only way that the market goes down is for sellers just we're gonna tell what's on a grander"
"631290","639730"," scale here sitting above here on this on these on this weekly a monthly trigger down here sellers"
"639730","645930"," need to to to attack it right and attack it and attack it they don't really have a choice but"
"645930","650490"," to break through these last two levels for the market to go down significantly"
"650490","660250"," if we likelihood of the market going"
"660250","669530"," down is much less than then closing below these levels or not being able to attain 410 by the end"
"669530","678050"," of the month so what what happens here is this I'm gonna show you another chart here for you excuse"
"679550","686720"," me for just a minute I'm actually gonna bring one more tool up for you to see too they try"
"686720","696690"," to kind of visualize this for you one of the most for you to"
"696690","705910"," visualize this in terms of of what's happening in the background here or a visual representation"
"705910","718020"," maybe it's better to say yes the"
"718020","725840"," weekly is looking strong here man it really is the monthly is looking horrible right now daily is"
"725840","732600"," doing great the one hour is what you're concerned with we're showing weakness in the one hour right"
"732600","748270"," now see if I can show this in a better it's not"
"748270","753930"," so weak depends we could go either way right here but what I want to show you guys is this"
"753930","758010"," actually we're not looking that week I'll show me give you a second me a second here I'll show it"
"758010","767830"," to you guys you book that here I was bring"
"767830","774830"," this over for you now I'm trying to explain let me try to explain this in a better way for"
"774830","784660"," you here okay so these this is a weekly and a monthly trigger down below here"
"784660","792120"," and the bears are trying their best right that they want to break through or at least sell into"
"792120","799200"," these buyers so much so that these levels become much weaker we know that the monthly is nowhere"
"799200","805840"," near as strong as the as the weekly I can show you that another chart but the point here is"
"805840","812080"," that they're they're selling right into these buyers and the key here is that for the key for you"
"812080","818660"," that you need to know is that you see these bumps here right every every week and every month these"
"818660","827300"," triggers come to come higher and coming into the end of the month if you see I'll say come into"
"827300","833640"," the 28th over here that's 27th but if we come into the end of the month and you start to"
"833640","840140"," see these monthly is turning down and these weekly is turning down it opens the door trap door"
"840140","847780"," basically for us to trade much lower on on spy on the market at least and so all this all"
"847780","855160"," this damage that's being done can repair itself but so this is this implies that sell side knows"
"855160","861240"," that if they if we can't get above like 410 for eight somewhere in there by in a month that"
"861240","869900"," the trap doors open down below for lower lows into end of quarter banks know this hedge funds know"
"869900","878420"," this colors on the market know this little bit too risky for sell side to say okay well if we're"
"878420","883760"," not going down and let's say sell side can't get down below here into end of month then the the"
"883760","893480"," obvious answer is that we're going higher and truthfully if if we don't get down below these"
"893480","900500"," levels you know let's look at this from a perspective of profit right are we going up just to 420"
"900500","908180"," is if we're being told we're not going down then 420 is not enough you need three 400 points maybe"
"908180","914240"," even higher to confirm this move higher and you're talking about a longer period of time to if we"
"914240","919680"," can't break these levels in February we're likely not going to break through them in March if we"
"919680","925600"," have that repair that's done for the month of March you're not going to see crazy lows like you"
"925600","931700"," know we were before we're talking about 3200 right or 3,000 or 2,800 and now we're just saying"
"931700","938500"," can we get down to 3,600 and 3,600 is almost rear-view mirror if you can't close the"
"938500","944660"," month below these weekly and monthly triggers for the month of February that we always talk about"
"944660","950640"," price and rear-view mirror with it and we start say we don't start saying market crash market crash"
"950640","955980"," but where's that number and that's a that's been a moving target right of where that is is it 20 "
"955980","962040","% another 20% down there's another 30% down from what price is it down those things kind of"
"962040","967680"," matters so you're seeing that you're seeing that right now heading in and if February so sellers"
"967680","975380"," trying to come in and we could weaken the market to actually get some much lower lows and what's"
"975380","983460"," not surprising here is if you get the close below the monthly at least if you get the close you're"
"983460","993000"," actually opening up a doorway like 3,300 it's open then right there's actually a chance of getting"
"993000","1001360"," there in March believe it or not there's a chance to get down here in March now you'll there are"
"1001360","1006160"," some out there that'll say well we've you know we've got we had support here and we had major"
"1006160","1012560"," support right here which I agree with right in here and right in here we had some major support"
"1012560","1020300"," come in and fascinatingly enough on into Friday's close I spoke with a few people off Twitter off"
"1020300","1026640"," YouTube and I was like man I was like back in December there was a Friday close that we had"
"1026640","1036020"," right in here where we were showing we were flashing a crash and this Friday's close same shit"
"1036020","1043900"," same same shit as a matter of fact we're flashing this same kind of a consolidation here"
"1043900","1052560"," is very similar to what we were showing in December as well not too far off from it"
"1052560","1058620"," so what are you looking for if you're a bull into the end of the month is you're looking for"
"1058620","1066460"," a market breath to go down and price not to follow is really what you're looking for the all the"
"1066460","1072020"," oscillators are out there PPOs PPMs are a hot mess right now they look really bad they look like we"
"1072020","1078800"," can go down significantly more and so we really need if you're a bull we really need time here we"
"1078800","1087300"," need time to consolidate time for rotation and to go higher very similar to what took place here in"
"1087300","1094560"," December and what's fascinating is you were able to see and watch after that Friday close you're"
"1094560","1101900"," able to watch the actual rotation in the market take place and when people were calling for a crash"
"1101900","1107980"," here I think this is a week or maybe eight sessions later you knew we were going up you could"
"1107980","1117160"," see that we had rotated and not and consolidated and rotated and not began to sell down to where we"
"1117160","1123680"," would have a bloodbath so we'll be watching for that and you should expect volatility in this move"
"1123680","1131800"," today Friday last week and even in the coming days into the 28th and it should be a way for"
"1131800","1137360"," you to see even what we what to expect in March if you're looking for a for a down month"
"1137360","1142760"," in March you want to see a closed blow for a 408 410 I promise you that you want to"
"1142760","1150180"," see us closing below not only that but you would really like to see a closed below you'd really"
"1150180","1154120"," like to see a closed below honestly at"
"1154120","1163900"," some point you currently I know they were telling you it was"
"1163900","1172340"," 400 but it isn't it's actually below below this three that right currently it's 395 62 and prior to"
"1172340","1178180"," that it was 39493 and you as a bear you really want to see that you want to see this"
"1178180","1185460"," like in a month close below here with conviction to open the door to lower lows telling you I start"
"1185460","1191240"," closing above this you start closing above the hourly the daily any of these thing any of these"
"1191240","1198340"," numbers above here and now it's coming even lower you start closing above like 403 if we are able"
"1198340","1203560"," to close above 403 believe it or not and you see the hourly and the daily and all these all"
"1203560","1210840"," these clusters come from our needs it's going to be very aggressively or will be aggressively"
"1210840","1218120"," positioned to the upside this looks better for the bulls at that point then the bears you really"
"1218120","1224920"," you don't want to see all this all all these triggers and volume excuse me a velocity underneath"
"1224920","1231140"," price you really want to see as a bear you want to see velocity coming down on top of price"
"1231140","1237440"," you want to see all these triggers on top and price leading lower here so this is kind of like"
"1237440","1244340"," a battle the next week or so deciding the fate of the market now if you want to know my"
"1244340","1250080"," position on this I've heard people say well we can we can at least go to 380 or we can"
"1250080","1255200"," at least go to 360 I don't see why we can't but I'll be honest with you if we start"
"1255200","1262740"," getting underneath all these clusters my view is that your next real support the next cost or the"
"1262740","1268660"," next trigger is that 3300 so just be aware of that if this is the time when they're gonna roll"
"1268660","1274180"," it I've heard people say watch out for the yield curve inversion I'm like I went back to this"
"1274180","1281000"," weekend just to check my just to recheck myself I went back and you can't find this out with just"
"1281000","1288780"," that doesn't work like the two-year yield we have a yield curve inversion that rolls over and the"
"1288780","1294380"," market can melt straight up for an entire year you need other things to happen you need the bottom"
"1294380","1299960"," of unemployment which we're kind of close to but you need inflation bottoming out you need rates to"
"1299960","1305360"," be paused or cut and if you don't have those things I'll tell you what the yield curve inversion"
"1305360","1311920"," can roll right the fuck over and the market can go fucking not even sideways just melt straight up"
"1311920","1318960"," for a full year just imagine like a year of us melting up forget sideways so you got to contend"
"1318960","1326020"," with that as well macro signals right I'm really honest with you sometimes macro signals look clear"
"1326020","1334280"," as day clear as day out there and right now it's a disaster it's a pure disaster if you think"
"1334280","1340300"," that it only ends badly maybe but not before going up or not before possibly going up 400 points"
"1340300","1346380"," you know they almost I'm gonna say something it was looking like this weekend I was looking a lot"
"1346380","1352740"," like Mike Barry being like the market is a bubble and then attempting to short it for the next"
"1352740","1359940"," three years or ten years it looks like that it looks like man like you can see this market go"
"1359940","1367900"," up like crazy and then finally he gets his he gets his payday it looks that that horrible right now"
"1367900","1372380"," or at least the macro picture this stream is sponsored by to the tick you can sometimes put it all"
"1372380","1378360"," together and be like the binoculars this looks like we're gonna roll the fuck over it looks clear"
"1378360","1388000"," it looks much think of like the fed if you look at the fed right"
"1388000","1393580"," it's like you walk you kicked in the door and they got they got Jenny yelling covered in flower"
"1393580","1401480"," they got Jerome Powell's got eggs all over him you know it's like it looks like the sweetest chefs"
"1401480","1406980"," in the kitchen with him and they got beaker in there and you really don't know what they're making"
"1406980","1412220"," it could be really bad or they could be all right you know you just don't know at this point"
"1412220","1418300"," so it so macro economic conditions tough to look at right now I feel really bad some people out"
"1418300","1422840"," there are using some some indicators and I'm like there's no fucking way you can you can call that"
"1422840","1430700"," with conviction right now you just can't so be aware of that as well I guess what the macro stuff"
"1430700","1435660"," is saying right now is a disaster we can go if it gets slow at some point today we'll take"
"1435660","1442320"," a look at all those things and I was what the reason why I was wondering this is because reason"
"1442320","1447220"," I was wondering this was because of what Jamie Diamond said because Jamie Diamond harped back on"
"1447220","1453160"," rates need to be cut and that was his thing this week when he brought that up as a man"
"1453160","1458800"," I bet he's looking at but she's looking at some macro shit and he's like what the fuck is all"
"1458800","1465760"," this so so of course I'm looking I'm like I know I know why he's saying that he basically needs"
"1465760","1471200"," it he basically needs a rate cut he basically needs a rate cut right now that's what he needs he's"
"1471200","1477120"," a bad to this market to roll over that's they need that they need rate cuts they don't have a"
"1477120","1484880"," choice let me bring a book map back up for you this morning I'll show it to you later today"
"1484880","1491240"," I'll bring up like I'll bring up the fed funds rate unemployment inflation all kinds of shit you"
"1491240","1499160"," have to see especially against SPX divided by the VIX moments in the market we vote we've run right"
"1499160","1506580"," over the yield curve inversion I'll say I'll say the to your yield it's wild to see because"
"1506580","1514660"," it's it's wild because it's not clear cut that's the problem right now is normally you can clear"
"1514660","1521440"," cut kind of see what's going to take place and the way the Fed has intervened the way the Fed"
"1521440","1527500"," put money into the system and the way that they're they're manipulating the system right now it's"
"1527500","1532840"," just fascinating to see absolutely a fast 850 million pounds of phones in an auction receiving one"
"1532840","1540840"," spot 29 billion pounds in bids APF field sale operation operation coverage one to 99 apologies you"
"1540840","1544780"," you you likely have we are now 10 minutes away from the top of the hour we do get the"
"1544780","1550080"," release of the US pending home sales change month over month will cost is 1% prior is to spot"
"1550080","1557020"," 5% was to get the US pending homes index which saw a prior read of 76 spot nine you"
"1557020","1565280"," likely have if I had to guess right I had to guess if you're like part of the you're part"
"1565280","1571780"," of the macro elite I would bet that you have no fucking idea what's gonna happen if I think I"
"1571780","1577580"," had to guess that you have no fucking idea where the right where at least where the where the stock"
"1577580","1584100"," market's going I would say it's it you can throw a dart at the dart board right right now because"
"1584100","1589120"," sometimes I'm like guys guys are right sometimes I'm like those guys have a have a fair point here"
"1589120","1594180"," we are now trading above the one minute and the five minute you can see us on the white here"

"3041160","3046660"," someone's asking is this always live no need to adjust anything like youtube yeah so here's the"
"3046660","3055740"," baseline youtube natively delays live streams by up to about 15 seconds now if your internet is"
"3055740","3060920"," slow that could add five seconds three seconds another 15 seconds could be 30 minutes but 30 30"
"3060920","3067760"," seconds behind uh so to catch up in youtube you have to go to the cog whale hit playback speed"
"3067760","3073780"," times two and it'll bring you to about a three to four second delay if you've got great internet"
"3075220","3084120"," Twitch doesn't do that delay natively so however good your internet speed is at home you will see"
"3084120","3095500"," one here you will see a um 400 sees"

"3118330","3124330"," 60 frames per second at 1080p i think they offer i think they offer like 4k ability and stuff like"

"4653330","4658670"," trying to sell it right down on r2 if they can now if they can't we squeeze back up here"

"5458870","5469280"," gotta be more disciplined yeah so"
"5469280","5474660"," we've got we've got a big ass gap down here to fill giants i was not gonna wake you this"
"5474660","5479360"," morning and i'm like man i'm like we got gaps dude i was like we got low i was like"
"5479360","5484340"," we've got low we've got low uh or a low liquidity environment gaps like above and below everywhere"
"5484340","5488960"," i'm like they're gonna go screaming above to close those and then they're gonna scream below to"
"5488960","5496470"," close the others and sure enough that's exactly what's happening right now just just zig it in"
"5496470","5505150"," zaggin and barons just ripped about help dude you know barons is a tough um"
"5505150","5512210"," i'm always going to last four words with reading barons it's always a disaster reading the shit"
"5512210","5521530"," that they they used to be well respected i think they just let anyone post in barons now blood red"
"5521530","5533020"," yeah right"
"5536700","5544180"," down here this is where that gap is we're right down below in the spray boxes right here huge gap"
"5544180","5551840"," to fill down below huge bowls we'll try to call this bush by closing these gaps but we all know"
"5551840","5557960"," that when we used to be bullish we'd leave gaps behind we left every gap behind we're bullish like"
"5557960","5562940"," we're in a bull market we left that shit behind for months we'd come back months later to go to"
"5562940","5572870"," go fill it yeah i got some uh bear music uh for you guys now we're working on"
"5572870","5582730"," uh some some bear music for the program here we're working on bull music bear music all kinds of"
"5582730","5588150"," stuff let me check in the background and see if the bears are losing this here or winning this"
"5588150","5593410"," we're checking the background because i know bears probably wander in so give me a second here uh"
"5596010","5602830"," not bad for bears right now i'm looking at the velocity for bears here the one thing that bulls"
"5602830","5607410"," have going for them is that they're on the daily trigger right now so the daily trigger is just"
"5607410","5614290"," below here so this should lend some support for bulls uh bulls haven't been able to stay above the"
"5614290","5621510"," daily trigger or not the daily hourly excuse me uh keep saying the daily but so right here there's"
"5621510","5626250"," the there's an hourly trigger here you can't see it on this me show it to you we show it"
"5626250","5632980"," to you in a different um just saying here"
"5632980","5639400"," so you're watching us squeeze higher and maybe wondering why we're not closing this gap immediately"
"5639400","5645960"," there's two reasons one that you want to see that you want to like bears want to get their"
"5645960","5653020"," rejection off this one minute uh worst case off of the five-minute here on the squeeze higher to"
"5653020","5659120"," get down and try to close these gaps down below uh right now i'm getting killed on my calls right"
"5659120","5663540"," now by the way they don't fucking care there's like you can't get paid those again now what i want"
"5663540","5671180"," to show you though is this is that an important thing for you to be looking for here is the"
"5671180","5678180"," hourly can i want you to see this here see this green line right here this is a very important"
"5678180","5686700"," thing for bulls uh to be above so outside of the one minute in the five minute in truth uh"
"5686700","5691640"," what bulls really want to stay above is this green line right here i'm going to show you why okay"
"5691640","5701610"," so right you see the importance of this if you are a bull what the importance of this"
"5701610","5711330"," is okay so just trend okay we're talking multi-day trend here um you see this so"
"5711330","5718310"," you can switch this up and i don't know what the best color is for this maybe orange or yellow"
"5718310","5724850"," or something all right i guess yellow works um so just right here case of like multi-day trend"
"5724850","5732390"," we're trading off of this powerfully right very bad for bulls right you never ever want to be below"
"5732390","5740710"," this as a bull and currently uh we're above it so currently at this moment you see us finding the"
"5740710","5747130"," support here see how this was just bought right here uh and bulls want to defend this hourly they"
"5747130","5754390"," have to if you don't defend the hourly here clear this up here if you don't defend the hourly i"
"5754390","5760010"," want you to see how good this can be and how bad this can be so just just some just"
"5760010","5764370"," like some some calm down if you're a bull calm down if you're a bear not calm down but get"
"5764370","5771410"," excited i guess if you're a bear when we trade above the hourly we tend to make some pretty big"
"5771410","5778010"," moves you'll see some violent violent reactions off of the hourly right you can see us when we"
"5778010","5783290"," trade through the hourly how nasty that can be but when we're trading above it we tend to trade"
"5783290","5790490"," higher right and right now has been the first chance for bulls to trade above this hourly right see"
"5790490","5796990"," us trying to win this hour right now you don't want to lose the hourly as a bull right you"
"5796990","5803850"," want to see us you want to see price stay above right so you can make some some much larger"
"5803850","5811730"," moves here right start to squeeze higher start to get that 410 in the 28th so just like what it's"
"5811730","5818730"," like when you're like you know having a panic attack or whatever um as a bull right that line is"
"5818730","5827490"," right here so you can see it this is that hourly candle and so uh what two bears want to"
"5827490","5834490"," do is bears want to say uh you know what you guys thought you people thought that um people thought"
"5834490","5840410"," that you were gonna be you know having to have an at least a bull run for some kind of"
"5840410","5846330"," you know like a day two days three days but you're not getting that right so these these uh bears"
"5846330","5854010"," are trying to trap a bull in right here right get down here start closing this stuff up then come"
"5854010","5860050"," back up and and reject and get all bearish again right get super bear get closing underneath some"
"5860050","5865770"," key levels um so if bears just do that then says we will examine the Ukraine's calls for us"
"5865770","5870730"," sanctions on Russia's nuclear energy sector we need to look at potential consequences for us and"
"5870730","5879070"," allies so if bears can't do that what you'll end up seeing is this this monster trade higher right"
"5879070","5886150"," this is in here you're going to see that either either the defense of the hourly right or the"
"5886150","5892190"," rejection of the hourly now here's a key point here okay is that if price gets underneath this"
"5892190","5896550"," hourly here see what this hourly is right here if price in the one and five minute get underneath"
"5896550","5903650"," this hourly it's it's bearish as fuck it's super bearish right you don't want to see price get"
"5903650","5909830"," underneath this you don't want to see price get underneath this right here if you start to see"
"5909830","5919130"," price at any point um trade under and start to launch off this this shit's like like bloodbath town"
"5919130","5925850"," down here like we just start ripping down we're gonna get down to that 395-394 it's a pretty"
"5925850","5939410"," significant trade near for bears uh and i'm betting the opposite direction right now oh"
"5939410","5947190"," boy why am i bet why am i buying the bottom hello there you know you didn't get to check"
"5947190","5953110"," this morning was the i didn't get to see if uh market breadth was was at a bottom i didn't"

"5979870","5987030"," market breath indicator is almost there like it's it's close it's getting seasony it's getting good"
"5987030","5997610"," like i'm looking at the market breath right now i'm like it's pretty fucking good i'm"
"5997610","6004070"," looking at we don't that one of the cool parts here is is that um even if we do like"
"6004070","6012890"," have a bloodbath i don't know man you better get that close bears better get that monthly close"
"6012890","6021830"," because if they don't uh markets almost completely liquidated almost not quite but almost"
"6021830","6027930"," completely liquidated not quite there needs a little bit more a little more lower prices maybe but"
"6027930","6034730"," but we're so close that we're you like chase was asking about call spreads last week and i said not"
"6034730","6042350"," yet we're we're almost there chase almost brother one way or another you're gonna know real soon"

"6252730","6259070"," the entire way now what you want to be careful of here in natural gas is or you want to"

"14683980","14690980"," way to get in and then another issue that I have with it is when I first started streaming Uh,"
"14691260","14697880"," I would make the mistake of showing my entire screen with my brokerage account numbers and shit So"

"21198420","21204480"," least close under 4060 Uh, so it makes sense to go under here."
"21204520","21206500"," It makes sense to trade lower from this point."
