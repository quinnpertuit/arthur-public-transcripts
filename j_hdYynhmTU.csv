"j_hdYynhmTU","313680","322600"," with my stuff over here. So I've been, I've been trying to, I've had some OBS studio issues"
"j_hdYynhmTU","322600","328680"," in the background and it just hasn't really, it hasn't really worked out well for me this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","328680","333520"," morning. You guys got a bourbon going right on. I hope everybody had a great weekend. Hope"
"j_hdYynhmTU","333520","338760"," you guys have been stressing over the weekend. We closed out on Friday. I'm going to, so"
"j_hdYynhmTU","338760","342200"," what I'm going to do is this, I'm going to, I'm going to go through this stuff this morning,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","342200","345280"," get it out of the way. So if anybody has other stuff to do, they can just kick on out of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","345280","352680"," here. What we'll save for the end, we'll save the Q and A session or whatever for people"
"j_hdYynhmTU","352680","357800"," that need to get out of here. And, uh, but we're going to get through some stuff this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","357800","360800"," morning. It's important. And what I'll try to do is if this live stream is not that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","360800","367960"," long, then I can, I can download it and edit it so that it's a prepackaged video for anyone"
"j_hdYynhmTU","367960","372320"," that didn't show up today. Because I think it's, I think this is, we're in a critical"
"j_hdYynhmTU","372320","377560"," point in the market right now. And so we're going to get through this right away. We'll"
"j_hdYynhmTU","377560","382840"," have a, we'll have a drink of bourbon later on or water or a doobie or whatever you like"
"j_hdYynhmTU","382840","389480"," out there. If you drink, uh, H2O, if you drink a sunshine or iced tea or whatever it is"
"j_hdYynhmTU","389480","394480"," that you do on a Sunday, uh, we'll kick back here afterwards for a half hour or so, have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","394480","400560"," a cocktail. Uh, but we're going to talk about the state of the market crash because we're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","400560","408840"," at a, we're at a critical point in the market. We're at a sort of a crossroad. And I need"
"j_hdYynhmTU","408840","413920"," you all out there to understand that, uh, this is going to work for you, right? Whether"
"j_hdYynhmTU","413920","420360"," you're a bull, a bear, it doesn't matter. Uh, you guys, I want you guys out there to have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","420360","428000"," to know where we are in the market so that you can invest trade scalp. It really doesn't"
"j_hdYynhmTU","428000","432000"," matter with this information in the back of your mind. I want you guys to, I want you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","432000","437880"," guys to take away from this video that, uh, this is a plan for you moving forward. You'll"
"j_hdYynhmTU","437880","443960"," know in this, in having this plan, you're going to know how to react as we move along."
"j_hdYynhmTU","443960","448680"," If you're a bull, you're going to be looking for these things to take place or not take"
"j_hdYynhmTU","448680","454320"," place to say, yeah, I'm bullish here. When you see people on social media or on YouTube"
"j_hdYynhmTU","454320","459840"," or on Twitter, Reddit, it doesn't matter. Wall Street pet stock to it. So whatever you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","459840","465360"," want to, you want to put the blinders on with this information because you're going to,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","465360","471080"," you're going to know, you're going to really know where we're headed with this information."
"j_hdYynhmTU","471080","476480"," You're going to have some, some key mark markers to show you where we're headed. It's going"
"j_hdYynhmTU","476480","481480"," to, it's going to give you the insight to know how to act as we move forward in the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","481480","486040"," market and, uh, how to position yourself in the market. Now I made a video like this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","486040","491280"," back in, back in the fall and I remember one of the, that, what, that one, I think it"
"j_hdYynhmTU","491280","496280"," did it once or twice. I can't remember what I was talking specifically about Apple and"
"j_hdYynhmTU","496280","500760"," I said Apple can go up from here, uh, but you're going to, you're, it doesn't, what"
"j_hdYynhmTU","500760","506240"," doesn't matter if Apple goes up from here into the first of the year or doesn't, you're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","506240","511560"," going to get trapped in here at some point, whether now or by first of year. And you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","511560","516240"," can see that that has played out, uh, this, this year, you know, we've been, it's been"
"j_hdYynhmTU","516240","523040"," a tough year. It's May 22nd. We're into June. It's been a brutal year if you're a bull."
"j_hdYynhmTU","523040","527200"," And we, you hear all the time, what people getting fucked and screwed over, right? You"
"j_hdYynhmTU","527200","532520"," got people long and cryptocurrencies getting, getting raked. Uh, you've got people that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","532520","538480"," are along the market that didn't, uh, didn't protect themselves, uh, and their cell just,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","538480","544080"," I'll just ride this out, right? I'll dollar cost average, all these things. Uh, so this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","544080","549640"," is the second video. This is an important video for you. I'm going to, I'm going to edit"
"j_hdYynhmTU","549640","555320"," this video later and I'm going to have people reference this video, uh, for the next six"
"j_hdYynhmTU","555320","560200"," months, uh, so that you can see where we are, even then you can go back to this video and"
"j_hdYynhmTU","560200","565280"," see if we had made certain milestones or broken through certain levels. Now when I"
"j_hdYynhmTU","565280","569480"," made this, or when I set this up this morning, for some reason, my computer, I had a, had"
"j_hdYynhmTU","569480","574840"," a volume profile, uh, program up and running and my computer's not happy with it this morning."
"j_hdYynhmTU","574840","580200"," I don't know why. So to turn that part off of the video this morning, I will post a photo"
"j_hdYynhmTU","580200","586560"," of the nodes for you so that you can see it later. Uh, later on, I'll post it on to Twitter"
"j_hdYynhmTU","586560","590200"," so you can actually see where the real nodes are in the market. I'm just going to tell"
"j_hdYynhmTU","590200","594200"," you where they are right now. Okay. That's some point. Now starting off this morning,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","594200","600120"," we get started here. We're going to get started with don't fight the fed. And there are two"
"j_hdYynhmTU","600120","606120"," faces right now to Jerome Powell. I want you to know that Jerome Powell is going to break"
"j_hdYynhmTU","606120","610920"," the market. He is going to break something. He doesn't care what he breaks, but he's not"
"j_hdYynhmTU","610920","617160"," going to take. He's not going to stop raising rates or QT or anything like that until he"
"j_hdYynhmTU","617160","624240"," breaks something. Now I posited. I talked about how I had some of you out there. I talked"
"j_hdYynhmTU","624240","629080"," from the phone and I say, you know, it's the Wild West with cryptocurrency right now."
"j_hdYynhmTU","629080","634120"," The government wants in on it. If you've never, if you don't know anything about this, right,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","634120","639840"," a store of value, go back and watch a hunt brothers documentary on silver and what the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","639840","645920"," government did. And like it like in 2007 2008, we had a housing crisis. I think that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","645920","653160"," might be the trigger. It may not. We may have some hedge funds blowing up here for when"
"j_hdYynhmTU","653160","659560"," the market breaks. We might might make a thought is and the rumor mill is on the street is"
"j_hdYynhmTU","659560","668200"," that there's a bank, a big bank that is over leveraged in the crypto space and a bank's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","668200","675960"," going to fold over this. And he's not going to stop raising rates until he breaks something."
"j_hdYynhmTU","675960","682760"," But I also think that there's a second hand to this that he's closer than you think he"
"j_hdYynhmTU","682760","691240"," is in ending raising rates. So my posit is that the market crash is going to be faster."
"j_hdYynhmTU","691240","695520"," And I also think it's in two parts. And we'll get into this later, how it's in two parts"
"j_hdYynhmTU","695600","700160"," when I laid all out for you. But I want you to, if you're a bull out there, if you're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","700160","704200"," a bear out there, wait, you know, he's not going to stop until he breaks something."
"j_hdYynhmTU","704200","710400"," Now my my my thought process is he's going to only raise rates in June. I think once"
"j_hdYynhmTU","710400","716160"," June is done, that's that's it for raising rates. I think we're done for this part of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","716160","724280"," the cycle or the or the or the this this part of the market cycle. You'll be shocked to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","724280","728200"," hear that. But we have to get to some certain numbers for that to happen. And I think it's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","728200","734840"," going to be sometime in June. I think it's sometime in June, you're going to see capitulation"
"j_hdYynhmTU","734840","740440"," from a large institution that that'll be the break point for the market. And I think they'll"
"j_hdYynhmTU","740440","744680"," I think they'll stop raising rates at that point. That'll be your last 50 point raise"
"j_hdYynhmTU","744680","749160"," for some time. And we're going to lay this all out for you today. But I want you to watch"
"j_hdYynhmTU","749160","753640"," this video briefly. This was Jay Powell. This was Jay Powell earlier in the week. And there's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","753640","759080"," two parts to what he says here that back up this this posit this theory. Okay, that he's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","759080","763400"," going to break something. Right. And then he's going to have that second he's going to have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","763400","767960"," that meeting. And he that second you're going to get that second 50 BPS. You're going to get"
"j_hdYynhmTU","767960","771960"," an institution that that collapses. It's not going to do the whole market. It's going to be one."
"j_hdYynhmTU","773720","777480"," It's just going to be one. And it's going to be the first part of the breakdown of this market."
"j_hdYynhmTU","777560","779880"," So we're going to watch the first part of this video right here together."
"j_hdYynhmTU","790360","791160"," This is this week."
"j_hdYynhmTU","808280","824760"," Now, just that part right there. I want you to understand out there if you're a bull."
"j_hdYynhmTU","824760","830920"," If you are a bull, okay, do not fight the fucking fed. The fed is saying that they are going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","830920","835240"," continue to push. All right, they're going to push. Now, this means they're going to break"
"j_hdYynhmTU","835320","838120"," something. In my in my view, they're going to break something."
"j_hdYynhmTU","857320","861800"," So this is the key point. He's going to talk to you right now about how once he breaks something"
"j_hdYynhmTU","862680","869000"," that he is going to lay off and he discusses it and he discusses this in the how the minutes"
"j_hdYynhmTU","869000","874680"," unrolled unfold and what's discussed inside of these fed meetings. This is his out now. I want"
"j_hdYynhmTU","874680","880520"," you to see that he has an out and it's probably in June. You'll probably find this out after the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","880520","885000"," June meeting in the and then why I don't think it's July. I think it's August or September."
"j_hdYynhmTU","885000","891000"," You'll see that you'll see the minutes get released for June or excuse me, I don't know if it's June"
"j_hdYynhmTU","891480","896760"," or it'll be in July, but you'll see the minutes released where that 50 people, they don't"
"j_hdYynhmTU","896760","903480"," announce the minutes right away after that FOMC. But once they do, you probably find that it'll be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","903480","907720"," announced that they're not going to raise rates anymore and you'll probably see the market"
"j_hdYynhmTU","908360","915720"," down substantially at that point."
"j_hdYynhmTU","921000","932360"," You guys have no sound of the fucking desktop audio? Hold on a second."
"j_hdYynhmTU","936520","939800"," God damn it. We're going to go back and do all this shit again."
"j_hdYynhmTU","939800","947320"," Let's see if we can go back here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","951880","960440"," Can you guys hear that now?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","960440","976200"," I do this fucking OBS is fucking killing me here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","978600","985080"," Tell me if you can hear him now."
"j_hdYynhmTU","985720","994200"," All right. So basically what he's saying here is this. I'll post a link to this conversation."
"j_hdYynhmTU","995720","998920"," Don't worry about it. It's fucking it's my fucking OBS. I'll fucked up."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1000280","1006520"," It's still fucked up. So the gist of the conversation is this. J-Pau is telling you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1006520","1012280"," in this conversation that he's going to break something. And then the second thing that he says"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1013240","1018200"," in this conversation that he had with the Wall Street Journal is that they haven't committed"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1018200","1024520"," to raising rates yet even in June. Now, I'll tell you what, they're going to raise rates in June."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1024520","1028920"," But I'll post this for you. There's too many jobs available. Turn on the subtitle."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1028920","1030600"," Now don't worry about the video. You guys have to watch that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1034600","1040120"," No, no, no. It works. I know it works. I just had to reboot my entire system again. Don't worry"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1040600","1043720"," about the fix in this. I want you to just realize this here, okay?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1043720","1048680"," That Jerome Powell is going to break this market. And I also want you to realize that we're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1048680","1054440"," closer than you think with rate hikes, hikes, ending. And he makes that statement in this interview"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1054440","1059800"," that he took place earlier in the week with the Wall Street Journal. The last point that I want"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1059800","1064200"," you to realize is like we had the banking crisis. I think you're going to see a large institution"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1064200","1069160"," that's probably wrapped up in crypto dumping in the crypto space. And it's probably not like"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1069160","1075000"," Bitcoin. It's probably Luna or something like it, Tether. I don't know where they're wrapped up"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1075000","1078760"," in this. But I think that that's what you're going to see take place as time goes on."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1079400","1085320"," So that'll be the break point that I'm looking for. The next thing I want to talk to you is about"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1085320","1091080"," this guy on Twitter. His name is Kuppy. And I want to talk to you about what Kuppy, I think"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1091080","1097400"," he posted this on the 14th of May right here. Turn over what Kuppy had to say. And you've always"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1097400","1103560"," heard me talk about when we put put together a bad week, a bad month. And then we start to stack"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1103560","1110440"," bad months into a bad quarter. The recovery from that takes longer. You actually saw see that every"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1110440","1116760"," year you even saw it in 2021. We had a bad summer at 2020 and 2021. We had a bad summer, a bad"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1116760","1122440"," fall. And you saw the recovery took longer as we stacked up weeks and months. We're coming into the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1122440","1128840"," Q two end, the end of Q two in June. And when you start to stack up bad quarters,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1130280","1137000"," one bad quarter, two bad quarters, the recovery from that takes time. Not one week, not a month."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1137800","1143960"," You start to take multiple quarters to actually recover from that. So we've had two bad quarters."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1143960","1149160"," You could be looking at another two bad quarters to four bad quarters. You're turning in a recovery"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1149160","1155720"," of just two bad quarters into a year, year and a half on the back end of that, right? So you're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1155720","1164040"," talking about not even coming back until possibly 2023 summer, which is, which is a lot of time"

"j_hdYynhmTU","1169560","1174200"," He said most, most, most hedge funds have quarterly, quarterly liquidity, right? The redemption"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1174280","1181400"," notice period is Q 30 or Q 45 days. Q one was a miss for most funds. Q two is a bloodbath."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1181400","1185720"," You're not allowed to bad quarters. Notices have been showing up a week. The big bulge"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1185720","1191800"," will be from tomorrow until end of month. The big bulge, he's referring to banks here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1191800","1198680"," And what his point that he's trying to say is that you had hedge funds that had to liquidate"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1198680","1204120"," last month. And now this month, you're going to get big banks that are going to have to liquidate"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1204360","1211240"," not only have to liquidate, but actually possibly front run liquidating their positions in the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1211240","1217480"," market. And he writes, he goes on to further write that PMs are in denial. These are portfolio"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1217480","1221880"," managers are in denial. These guys have had long relationships with LPs and LPs. They're just"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1221880","1227080"," putting in the notice as a placeholder, right? Quote, unquote placeholder. This is what we're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1227080","1232520"," going to talk about with front running is you'll start to see front running heading into the end of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1232520","1239800"," May, right? So that you can get ahead of any of these placeholder, these notices of placeholder"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1239800","1245960"," heading into June. So if you see the boxes being stuffed now for previously from hedge funds,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1245960","1250760"," and if you start to see big banks come in, you're going to then see what would you would call"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1250760","1257640"," almost like a panic move from portfolio managers that want to come even by end of quarter for that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1257720","1264520"," bad Q two PMs think that if things bounce, maybe redemptions get rescinded. Everyone is pleading"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1264520","1269720"," in denial. No one knows their real liquidity. Even if you know your outflows, you don't sell"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1269720","1274680"," today at what you think is the lows. Imagine selling the low and having a bounce on you while you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1274680","1279880"," hold cash, you'll end up just screwing the LPs. That's staying because they have no exposure to the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1279880","1287080"," bounce, right? Your CAGR is toast. You wait as we get closer to quarter end, the selling will pick"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1287080","1291800"," up. Everyone wants to go flat. That's a key point, right? Flat on the last day, because we're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1291800","1296760"," going to talk about June 30 Op X. We're going to talk. We're going to talk about June 30 Op X"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1296760","1301640"," and end of month in June and the options market and how that relates to where we are right now."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1303880","1307640"," So the last day is at least how a tracking area, but that is impossible for liquid names"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1307640","1313400"," impossible for big funds. The selling there has started. It will be a crescendo. I'm amazed"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1313400","1318360"," all the fuck twits. We still baggy stay up now to fade this move. The real selling hasn't even"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1318360","1323640"," started. Can we bounce? Sure. That's what Monday's looking for. We're looking for, right? We are"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1323640","1327960"," massively oversold waves of margin calls ended Thursday. This is a trading market for the buy"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1327960","1335320"," the fucking dip crowd, right? The week before quarter end, the bid wanted situations in small"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1335320","1339640"," capital start. My stinker bids will get laughed at. Do you know what stinker bids are? These"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1339640","1344040"," stinker bids are very much like spoof bids spoofing the market. It's when you put really,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1344040","1349000"," really low bids in the market hoping or hoping that they could get filled. Let's say you put a"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1349000","1355080"," bid down right now at 3200. You've got you've got hedge funds that'll put these bids in right now"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1355080","1361640"," to draw slower. And you've got people in the market with bids down at 3,600, 3200. My stinker"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1361640","1365800"," my stinker bids will get laughed at then spanked. The liquidity isn't there in these names. The"

"j_hdYynhmTU","1378600","1385560"," decade. Guys, forget how it goes. Many PMs are dealing with this for the first time since 0809."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1385560","1392920"," They forget how it works. This is a key here. If we get any kind of aggressive selling heading"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1392920","1398760"," into June for that bad quarter and at the same time, you're going to remember you've got PMs"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1398760","1403400"," out there that are thinking, you know what? I'll make it up the second half of the year, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1403400","1409560"," I'll just say, fuck it. We've lost Q1 and we've lost Q2. This is going to extrapolate into where"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1409560","1414120"," we are in the markets. We continue this talk. So keep this in mind what copy had to say."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1416040","1421960"," I also want you to know here that our closing on Q1 was 450.164. I'm going to show you where"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1421960","1429960"," that is in the chart later, but 451.64. So if so, copies saying the here that portfolio managers"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1430680","1437880"," are hoping for that, not only for that bounce, but that saving of Q2. So you already, you need"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1437880","1442680"," to know if you're a bull. Well, if we're going to save the rest of the market that we if we get"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1442680","1449880"," a bounce on Monday, that where do we where do we need to end June 30? 450. Unspylize. That's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1449880","1458360"," 450.164. I think it's 4530 on ES and I think SPX is I don't remember exactly where ES is, but"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1458360","1463880"," I'll show you this in the chart in a little bit. Now, the other conversation that he's talking about"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1463880","1471240"," in here is a large cap. He's talking about knocking the legs out of out of the major players, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1471240","1479480"," The Teslas, the apples, the Microsofts, the Googles, right? And we've already seen that begin to happen."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1479880","1485160"," You've seen it here on Tesla. You've seen the legs get knocked out on the majors over here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1485160","1491160"," right? You're seeing that take place right now. You're seeing the next legs being locked,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1491160","1497240"," knocked out of Apple over here, right? As you start to see this nice rejection above here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1497240","1504040"," I want you to see that you see some large caps have not participated in the in the swift"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1505000","1510760"," the past week specifically. Tesla's a prime example. You saw Facebook go down slightly,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1510760","1516120"," but not quite like Tesla did. So there are some majors that haven't gotten whacked yet,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1516120","1521960"," like Netflix, like Facebook. So what you'll end up seeing is you'll see the majors get knocked out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1521960","1527800"," and then you'll finally see the S&P 500 get knocked out. It'll be the last to go down."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1527800","1533720"," There's still a bid, believe it or not, in the S&P 500. So once you start to see these legs"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1533720","1538840"," getting knocked out of the majors, you'll start to see capitulation from people that have that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1538840","1545880"," people, but PMs that actually have money inside of the S&P 500, right? They actually own the S&P 500"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1545880","1552040"," for pension plans and 401Ks and all that kind of stuff. The last thing I want to make a point"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1552040","1557320"," here for is where do the banks want to buy this market? So if you're looking at, if you're just"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1557320","1561480"," looking at the market overall, where do they want to own Tesla, right? Let's go back to Tesla real"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1561480","1568040"," quick. And let's look at Tesla on a larger time frame here. And let's look back at 2020. This is"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1568040","1575560"," March. This is March, right back here, March 2020, $72. People say I can't get down to $72 cap. I don't"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1575560","1579720"," know that it can either. I don't think it'll get down there. But I want you to see maybe maybe in"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1579720","1585000"," two years that could get down there. And you don't think that $164 sounds better to me."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1585000","1590760"," Maybe 200 or maybe 200 bucks I'd put on there. And maybe in a year and a half $200. And I'm"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1590840","1594760"," going to show you how this how this plays out to get down there. I know you don't want to hear"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1594760","1601160"," this. I know you don't. And I think it happens in two stages. I think you see this first stage"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1601160","1607800"," down here into June. And then the second stage of decline is going to take place into 2020,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1607800","1612600"," three believe it or not. And they're going to knock the legs off two times."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1614680","1619240"," It's kind of wild, right? You wouldn't expect this, but this will be accelerated selling"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1619240","1621480"," in companies like Tesla and Apple."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1623800","1628680"," So the first thing I want to show you here after I get up Apple here is I want to show you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1628680","1634600"," the spy here. Okay, this is the this is the SPI. This is the spy, right? We're going to talk"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1634600","1640920"," about market cycles. We're going to talk about market cycles. We talked about this before."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1642120","1645800"," When we talk about market cycles, there's last week I kept saying to all of you out there."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1645800","1648680"," So I'm going to show you some on Friday. I think I said to you, I'm going to show you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1648680","1654600"," something on my computer or my computer was resetting itself and I couldn't bring up the data"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1654600","1659640"," and all the stuff for you. But I said to you that the market crashes and bear markets have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1660680","1668440"," become faster and faster. I also talked to you about how the market crashes themselves are faster,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1668440","1676360"," but the bear markets can't catch up to them. The advent of consolidation of interest between"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1676440","1683800"," retail traders, banks, hedge funds, the dissemination of information is increasing or the quickness"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1683800","1690520"," of a crash, but then there are real parts of our economy that can't catch up. Old school,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1690520","1697880"," real business stuff, shortages, inflation, those kind of things aren't affected as much by the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1697880","1703160"," information age. So without those catching up those those things aren't as compressed."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1703960","1709080"," Now, I want you to see where we've got these lines. You see this nice white line right here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1709080","1714280"," these just double white line right here. See this nice expanding wedge right here? You see these"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1714280","1719560"," previous things over here, these lows? I want you to see this top up here, right? Pay attention"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1719560","1725240"," to this right now, right? This is currently where we are on the spot. Hold on here. Let me just take"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1725240","1732840"," it here. And then I want to show you this over here, okay? This is stock market cycles."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1733960","1740440"," This is the technical trader. I want you to see this same, you see this same expanding wedge"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1740440","1747560"," here with this megaphone pattern. You see this top up here? You see that top, right? You see"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1747560","1753800"," the top of this? You see this right here? You see this rejection and a swift move down, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1754920","1760520"," I want you to see this where we are. I want you to make this smaller here, okay? I want you to see"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1760520","1773640"," this where we are right now. And I want you to see this, okay? You see this right here? I want"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1773640","1780520"," you to pay attention to this, okay? We'll trade exactly like this? Probably not. Probably not."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1781400","1784680"," We're going to, I'm going to show you that real quick, okay? I want you to see that. And I'll"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1784680","1788760"," post this to Twitter for you. The next thing we're going to go back to is we're going to look at the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1789720","1796520"," spy back in 2000. We had crashed back then. This crash right here, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1797960","1802760"," Was a long and drawn out crash. If you look at the time frame, this was March of 2000."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1803400","1810600"," And this was March of 2003. This was a three year, right? Three year crash. It was brutal."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1810600","1817640"," It took forever. It took forever. It was brutal. It was a slow grind down."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1818520","1824280"," What do you notice about this, right? About when this happened, right? They had this one last"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1824280","1828840"," nice higher close, right? They broke above here. I want you to see that, right? This is going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1828840","1835400"," play into where we are right now. They broke up and above. It couldn't hold and then made another"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1835400","1840280"," low. This would, this would correlate if you had a slow crash. This would correlate to a bounce on"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1840280","1847800"," Monday. That goes higher to like, let's say it goes to 450, 453, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1849320","1855720"," 450, 453, close at 435 to 450. Maybe we get a, maybe we don't close in the high for the quarter."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1855720","1864040"," Close just under 453. Close just under it, right? And what do we do? This is if this was right now,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1864040","1868280"," pretend this was right now, right? We'll hit that for just on that 453. And we're going to,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1868280","1872360"," we're going to start a cycle that goes down for one to three years. Probably not three years."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1872360","1878840"," I bet you had sped up maybe a year and a half or so. This would also be something where we go"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1878840","1885400"," higher. Let's say this week, next week. And then we actually get down to 360 in June."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1886040","1891800"," Then we just rip back higher. Then we get down to 320, right? We start going down and down and down"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1892440","1896840"," down. This is 2008. This is a fast crash."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1899080","1904760"," See this last relentless decline. We just did this, right? But this is a smaller time frame in here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1904760","1909160"," right? See a smaller time frame that we have. And this is, and you notice that the,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1910440","1915240"," that the counter trend move, right? We have a counter trend trend trade that everyone's expecting"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1915240","1920920"," on Monday. This is one where it fails lower. We don't get actually get up to 450. We probably"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1920920","1927400"," don't even get up to 430 or probably get up like 410 or so, 415. And it's an immediate reversal."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1927960","1932280"," What would set this off? We've got the Fed minutes coming out. We know about that, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1933320","1937320"," Got Fed minutes coming out that could set that off, easily set that off this week. Once the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1937320","1941720"," minutes come out and they say, fuck no, we could possibly do 75 points. What else could set this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1941720","1947800"," off? Fed minutes come out and you find you see a bank fail. That was wrapped up in tether."
"j_hdYynhmTU","1948520","1954840"," I'm not anti crypto Bitcoin. I'm not anti any of that stuff, but it would be, it would be,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1954840","1962040"," it would be hilarious if you saw the Fed. Number one, wanting to control the crypto space, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1963880","1969880"," And the wild west of banks getting involved in it, almost getting a yes, it's okay to get into"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1969880","1974520"," crypto. Now in reality, they might want to, they might want to slam crypto down to get some"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1974520","1982120"," regulation. You saw Luna, people from the Luna crowd saying, well, we should have some kind of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1982120","1987720"," FDIC insurance, right? That's hilarious. All of a sudden you want insurance on your crypto space,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1987720","1993240"," right? You want stable real stablecoin, like a dollar that's backed by some kind of, by some"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1993240","1999400"," kind of regulation, right? So all this is unfolding right now. So we've got two different choices,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","1999400","2004440"," right? We've got the one choice that's slow and grind down. I want you to be aware of this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2004600","2007480"," option. We've got three options. I'm going to show you all three options here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2009000","2014120"," Option one, slow grind down. You're going to see us trade up, probably just below"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2015800","2023560"," 451, 4164. You'll see us not break 45061, and we'll trade down to 360, 461,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2024280","2028520"," or 41 down to 360 is a nice decline. Beautiful next, next leg down."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2029560","2033640"," Going to take forever. It's going to take a probably year and a half. Second choice."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2035320","2041240"," This is the fast one. This one, I'm going to expect us to break through 360,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2041960","2047160"," and we're going to slap 3, 320, believe it or not. And there's, there are nodes. This is the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2047160","2052680"," point where I'd show you the market profile, but there are, there are no real nodes until we get"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2052680","2059720"," to 320. There's a stop along the way around 350, 360. But I'll tell you what, if you get a bad"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2059800","2064200"," minutes and you get a bank folding, we'll, we'll head right down to 320 like it ate nothing."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2065720","2071000"," And that's where you'd see that capitulation move. This is true capitulation. Even on Friday,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2072040","2077640"," when we were closing on Friday, that looked like a reversal to me, but it didn't look like a"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2077640","2084280"," reversal with, with, with force. It didn't look like a reversal with the free money printer."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2085080","2090920"," It didn't look like a reversal that I've seen in the past where it was conviction."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2092920","2099000"," It didn't have that oomph that you're looking for, that V-shaped immediate recovery. If any of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2099000","2103720"," you know what those are like, they don't take until the last 15 minutes or the last hour"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2104840","2111160"," of the day. They are immediate. You can't even catch up most times. Most times when you slam down"

"j_hdYynhmTU","2117240","2121800"," When you guys talk about, uh, where do the banks want to buy? We already know where the banks"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2121800","2126680"," want to buy. I can tell you where it is. It's where it's where they started over here. This is what"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2126680","2134680"," they buy capitulation, panic, anger, depression, like we don't even have this yet. This, this isn't"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2134680","2139880"," retail down here. These are banks and they're going to take it back down here. Again, at some"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2139880","2145880"," point, it doesn't matter if it's, if it doesn't matter if it's in, in June, it doesn't matter if"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2145880","2150120"," it's in three years, but that's what they're going to do to you. I promise you that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2152280","2158200"," Now we're going to go back to the S&P 500 and how this relates here. We're going to get down the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2158200","2169400"," nitty gritty here. And one last thing I want to show you is the node in June. I want you to see"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2170200","2179720"," you see this right here. This is June 17th. This is a 30% of the putgamma in the market. 30%"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2181160","2189480"," June 17th down. Do we get down there? Then most of it's at around 360. Do we get down there?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2189960","2200600"," June 13th, maybe close to it, maybe June, maybe maybe 360-ish, but we could even have a lower low"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2201400","2208520"," just after it, end of June before July 1st. That would also coincide with maybe the Fed coming out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2208520","2213000"," and saying, oh, no, for the minutes coming out and saying, well, we're not going to raise rates"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2213000","2218040"," any longer. And that's when you get your snapback trade, your trade higher. So we're going to go"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2218040","2228520"," back to the spy here. Let's go back to the one year once more and how that lines up. And you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2228520","2236280"," can see that 360 down here, right? We could trade up here, get rejected around this 410,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2236920","2243240"," right? If you see a rejection above here at 410, 415-ish, maybe you'd see that swift move down"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2243240","2249800"," of 363.50 here. But if we get any further bad news, you'd see a plunge, believe it or not,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2249800","2256200"," down to 320. I'll post the volume profile to show you the real nodes on the market where the real"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2256200","2263160"," supply is, excuse me, the real demand is. And the demand is at 320, not 360. These are the stink"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2263160","2271000"," bids down here at 320. Like Kapi was talking about. The first big node is that, or medium-sized"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2271000","2276920"," node is at 350, 360-ish. But the real node is down below it. Actually, it starts at 334."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2277560","2285240"," It's like 334 to fix that up. It's like 334 to 320 somewhere in here. And I'll post that on"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2285240","2289160"," Twitter for you later. So you guys have the volume profile, actually show it to you."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2290360","2297560"," Now, if you get the swift 2008 knockdown, you're going to be expecting a relief rally of some kind,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2298440","2305400"," right? I've got, what do I have on right now? I've got on a strangle for 400. I've got a strangle"

"j_hdYynhmTU","2313160","2319240"," strangle actually is up here at 400 to cover both sides. But I'm going to tell you that today,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2319240","2325000"," I probably expect us to go up on Monday. I'm going to expect though this, if you see a rejection"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2325080","2332520"," anywhere in here, 415, 420. If you see a swift reversal in the market, and we'll go there right"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2332520","2337320"," now, right? If you see a swift reversal in the market, this is your swift reversal. I'm going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2337320","2346600"," show it to you. If you see your swift reversal, and it's things start to get nasty, right? If"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2346600","2353480"," things start getting nasty in here, if you start to see something like this up here, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2354120","2364840"," 415, we start plunging down here. No, no reason not to see no reason not to see 360 by June,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2366760","2372120"," sometime in June. There could even be a bounce in here. We could take it to June 23rd, June 30th."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2372680","2375720"," So any kind of swift reversal, we're heading down there."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2376600","2384600"," FMC minutes coming out soon, right? Swift reversal time, right? Next thing I want to talk to you about"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2384600","2394120"," is, this is that 451 64 up here, right? Look at that. Isn't it amazing how that coincides"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2394680","2399880"," on that larger timeframe, that 451 64? Let's look at it again."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2400120","2412040"," A big old fat line that I showed you earlier, right? 451 64. I talked about earlier. See that topic?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2412600","2417960"," So that head and shoulders up here, right? Notice how this is the Q2 right up here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2418760","2428600"," This is Q2. Got to be above here at the end of June 30th. Have to. So if we let's say we don't"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2428600","2434680"," have this swift reversal here and you want to start getting bullish, right? We'll be looking"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2434680","2440360"," for something like this and then a trade higher. We can take that trade higher. But if we take that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2440360","2447400"," trade higher, we're still not bullish yet. We're still just trading into June for all you bulls out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2447400","2454120"," there. We're still just trading into June for this trade here. If you see this trade here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2454760","2460280"," the only second thing that you could pause it would be that instead of 2008,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2460280","2467240"," you're getting 2001 2000. That's where you're going to get a rejection here and you're actually"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2467240","2473320"," going to trade. You actually fix that up for you. You get something like this and you trade down"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2473320","2478280"," to 360 or 350. It could be something like this here instead."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2478440","2489080"," Now, the horrible part of this is your next trading zone. Your next trading zone, what you'd"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2489080","2498120"," start trading 4000 down to 360 and you'd staircase lower as time passes. And this would probably"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2498120","2504600"," take a year and a half of just down markets. Does that make sense? So your first option is rejection."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2505400","2512520"," Slam down to 320. And this would mark the Fed after June 30th telling you, we're not going"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2512520","2517240"," to raise rates anymore. This is the not going to raise rates anymore. I believe this that the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2517240","2521480"," Fed is going to stop raising rates here. And I believe that we'll have a further decline in the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2521480","2528200"," market as we move down over times. I still think we'll get the further decline. But this part of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2528200","2533400"," the trade is done at this point. See this down below here? I want you to show you this."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2535080","2541320"," This part of the trade is not done down here. This second action, right, you'll see that you'll"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2541320","2547320"," see the first action end. And once we get down to this 320, we will make all time highs once again."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2547320","2551960"," And we will then make a further decline down and we'll actually tag this back in or sometime in"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2551960","2559320"," 2023. Okay, so maybe aware of this as we move forward. So you get the first two paths done,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2559800","2566360"," right? We already know that the strikes that we're looking for in here, right? We've got one here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2568440","2573080"," We already know where we are here. We got 405. I think it's 415 somewhere above it."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2573960","2580200"," Anywhere from 400 to 415, you're looking for rejection. Your next rejection point is up here"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2580200","2588440"," at 4164. This is a firm line. This is firm June 30th, June 30th. You're looking for that in June 30th."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2589560","2596760"," The dragged out bear market. If you want to also know in the dragged out bear market,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2596760","2601240"," if we trade down on that dragged out bear market, let's say let's go back to that one year."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2602600","2608680"," If we trade down to that dragged out bear market, I'm going to snap a line here. It's going to be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2608680","2618440"," 364.82 right there. 364.82. I'm not going to do this right now, but you get the picture. It's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2621480","2629560"," if you want to keep it in 2001, 2000, 2001, where it's the long drawn out crash, you'll see"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2630440","2638280"," let me clear this out. You'll see the trade up. You'll see this fail and you'll see"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2639880","2647080"," us go no lower than 364.34 in 2022. We'll trade sideways the rest of the year and down."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2648120","2656280"," And then next year, you'll see us go down below 364.34. Anything below this 360 and it's going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2656280","2662120"," get nasty. So keep that keep keep this price target in mind right here. And I'll post these"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2662120","2668120"," charts. I'll post these charts with some with some text down here to show you what you're looking"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2668120","2676360"," for as we trade forward. The last the last thing that I want to show you is if you're a bull."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2679080","2683240"," See, we can get on a six month chart. I'd say you're a super bull, right? You're like, yeah,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2683240","2690360"," I'm super bullish cap. You are not only looking for, you know, we beat this area here, we beat"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2690360","2698200"," this area here, right? You're not actually truly bullish. Stop that there until we break above"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2698920","2706200"," all time highs and hold it. Now, I don't think you're getting that. I think you're crazy if you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2706200","2710600"," think you're getting that. I think that's so far out right now of a chance because if we do get"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2710680","2714360"," even close to here, they're going to continue to raise rates because you're not taking them"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2714360","2720360"," seriously. You get what I'm saying? You don't have the free money printer anymore. You've already"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2720360","2728360"," spent six months dumping this market. Don't believe for a second that right here. The bank said, oh,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2728360","2733960"," yeah, we're all getting on board down here together. We're going to kumbaya. We're going to ride this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2733960","2738680"," up together. Don't ever believe that the banks are going to take all their money back and start"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2738680","2740680"," over once more."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2753000","2754760"," So you can get this back here and win your chart."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2761720","2766200"," So my expectations, I want to give you this too. My expectations for Monday, I just want to be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2766280","2772440"," clear with you all. I am pretty bullish on Monday. My expectations are that we're going to be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2772440","2780600"," bullish when we're going to probably open up probably around 405 and make an attack for 410"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2780600","2790520"," if I had to guess. See what you guys are talking about in here. Let me scroll through."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2790520","2798920"," The Fed is just about done. They cannot take rates higher. Book it. I agree with that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2799800","2803800"," I think they're going to take rates to above 5% somewhere in there."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2806200","2809560"," The Fed will definitely take. Let me see what you guys talking about here. Guys, don't get wiped."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2809560","2814360"," They will whack fix. We got to retest higher. Hire them and go wear gym hopes."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2815160","2817400"," Death cross. I am not up. You see that cross, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2821800","2824680"," Yeah. Mero is saying probably go up. I agree with that. We're going to probably go up."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2825560","2831160"," We do not get got to retest anything higher than 393 Monday 11 minutes over. Elevator channel."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2831880","2835560"," 400 Monday is top of main channel where there's been like six reversals."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2835560","2840440"," It calls me crazy. I've ever went to QQQ was near 500. Yeah, that's what I meant. 410 retest."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2840440","2844200"," Yeah, it'll be somewhere in there. It's going to be somewhere. It's going to be somewhere"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2845160","2850040"," and you can see we've done this in the past, right? You guys can see that we've broken above"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2850040","2854840"," and out of here. It's not out of the realm of possibility. It's not even out of the room"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2854840","2860200"," of possibility that we could trade up to the 430s. I would even give if you're a bear here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2860200","2867080"," Let's talk about being a bear here. Tell me being a bear here. If you are a bear here, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2868120","2872120"," I said on Friday, I said you could get some put spreads. We'll probably come back down and"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2872280","2877480"," revisit this in June. Even if you're bullish, probably come down there. We'll have volatility"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2877480","2882040"," with the FOMC minutes. We'll sell the FOMC minutes regardless of where we are here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2882840","2888600"," It's like some put spreads to here. Then I get some monthly puts here and then some zero"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2888600","2896440"," to eight puts here, right? They can squeeze shorts up here. I don't think we get up here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2896440","2902280"," but if we do, we do. But somewhere in here, it wouldn't be out of the realm of possibility."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2902280","2908680"," We could take it to 415, even possibly 430 before the decline down below."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2912120","2915960"," I think we're going to have to live with inflation. Someone's asking about housing."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2915960","2920600"," I think housing is going to continue to go up. I think that inflation is going to stay with us."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2920600","2926120"," I think shortages are going to stay with us. I think that the only two chances that you have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2927080","2933960"," are, of course, no more raising of rates and the Ukraine were ending. That would be the only"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2934840","2936120"," reversals that you'll see."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2939880","2943160"," Which one do you want? This is extremely valuable. I was thinking, cap, you're welcome."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2948200","2951640"," They're not going to stop raising rates. I'll make a bet with you that they do."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2952040","2957880"," The only way they don't stop raising rates is if we trade higher. I promise you, right? And I'm"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2957880","2963400"," going to bet with all of y'all out there. If we trade higher and try to get up into above 451"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2963400","2971720"," into June, they will continue to raise rates. If we trade down into 363.20, I'll make a guaranteed"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2971720","2980520"," bet to you that they stop raising rates for now. For now. And then we're going to trade up to 400"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2981400","2986680"," at some point or trade sideways and up to 400, slightly over 10 of year. And then you'll see them"
"j_hdYynhmTU","2986680","2994200"," raise rates once again. I'll make that bet with all of you out there."
"j_hdYynhmTU","2997080","3004200"," We do. I think we do, shit slammer. I think we do eventually tag that line. I think though"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3004200","3010440"," that it's down the road. Let's look at that in a larger time frame as well. Do we actually"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3010520","3017720"," tag this line? I do think we tag it. I think we do tag it. And I think it's somewhere down the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3017720","3023320"," road here. This is very low, right? 160s. It could possibly be higher. You might see buyers"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3023320","3028760"," coming to the market slightly higher. You might see something like this play out here, right? This"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3028760","3036200"," is the 300s and we break down below here briefly, 240 or so, right? But it would not, it's not for"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3036200","3043000"," me. It's not off the table. So this is the 200s down. This is not off the table heading into 2023,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3043000","3047720"," 2024. And how do we get there? If you weren't, we want to know how we get there. We get there by"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3047720","3055000"," this. We get there by making our new accepted trading zone. If we get down to 320, let's say,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3055000","3061080"," right? We ended up having a trading zone. We trade in here for the rest of the year. We can trade"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3061080","3068200"," above it briefly. And we can trade below it briefly. And then you'd see 2023. Our trading"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3068200","3074600"," zone would be somewhere between 300 and let's call it 300 and 240. That's how you get there."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3076680","3080200"," So you're all okay down here, right? And then you're all okay down there. This is how you get"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3080200","3085080"," down that low. And you say, this can't happen, Cap. There's no fucking way. I will bring you back"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3085880","3095080"," and bring you back to here. And how yes, you can. This is capitulation. This is anger. This is"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3095080","3102440"," depression. This is disbelief, believe it or not. This has happened in recent history. We had this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3102440","3111480"," happen in 2000. We had this happen in 2008. We had another event like this in 2000. But what was"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3111560","3115640"," going with that? So some of you that haven't been in the market, when we were in 2019,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3116280","3121320"," we kind of knew we were getting it. We knew it was coming. If you were a trainer and investor in"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3121320","3127400"," 2018, 2019, you knew it was coming. We're close. And when it happened in in March of 2020,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3127960","3132840"," February or March of 2020, you February, March 2020, then into April,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3133400","3143880"," um, it was, we had the Fed put, right? Unlimited QE. And it was an unnatural thing that took place"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3143880","3149480"," at that moment. So we kind of postponed this event taking place and happening. Now, I'm not"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3149480","3155400"," anti us going up to all time new highs. But the, but in reality right now, I want you guys to go"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3155400","3160520"," back to the video earlier that you couldn't watch. I'll post that video for you. The Fed"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3160520","3166920"," chair is saying to you right away, he's saying, don't fight the Fed. And so the market's not"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3166920","3171960"," fighting the Fed. The market is trying to staircase us down on our own, right? And the moment that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3171960","3177800"," we get down in here, the Fed will stop raising rates and he will let us trade in here and they'll"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3177800","3184120"," wait and see at the end of the year of 2022. We can bounce here. We can go up here. There's no"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3184120","3189080"," like guarantee that we go down here, but this will give the wait and see timeframe for the Fed to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3189080","3194920"," see if shortages go away, if inflation subsides. I don't think they're going to be able to do that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3194920","3198920"," I don't think the Fed can do that. I don't think that they're going to have that impact. I think"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3198920","3204200"," in this time period, you're going to see more failures. You're going to see more bank failures."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3204200","3208920"," You're going to see more companies failing. I think this gives the timeframe for people to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3210120","3214760"," get laid off at their jobs, believe it or not, right? Tightening within companies. It gives the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3214760","3221800"," time for companies to actually impact inflation in shortages. And then when you start to see that,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3221800","3226920"," you'll start to see that next drop down into next year. Now, can we beat this? Let's say inflation"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3226920","3231160"," goes down. Let's say companies are happy. Hopefully you guys watch that short long-term debt cycle"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3231160","3234760"," that I talked to you about and we can break out of here. I'm not saying that we can't break out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3234760","3239640"," of here either. I'm telling you that the Fed wants us down here. That's what I'm telling you."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3240360","3247000"," If you trade up here, they're going to raise rates like crazy. This will force"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3247000","3253720"," a recession if we go up in here. They need a catalyst to get us down here. They need a catalyst"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3253720","3259400"," to get us trading below $4,000. You're probably going to get it. There's a high chance that you're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3259400","3266280"," going to get that catalyst heading into June Opex, believe it or not. I wanted to show you that,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3266280","3273240"," that June Opex. This is the prime time for it to happen right in here. The banks,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3273240","3280680"," they're here. This isn't retail traders. These are large banks. This is the JPM caller that's on"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3280680","3288600"," the market for us to head down. These are tagged at $3,600. If you're long-volving, you have to get"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3288600","3298360"," to $3,600 now, like end of May, like May 30th, you need to get to $3,60. If you don't get to $3,60"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3298360","3305080"," by end of May, in, we're in June, you're going to need to be down at $3,20 for Volgeng to get paid"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3305080","3310760"," and for us to scream higher. I won't show you a Vix chart today, but for us to scream higher to $6,200"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3310760","3316920"," bucks or whatever. In the big chart, it's like $100. That kind of matches up to the same thing."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3316920","3322760"," All these pieces are in place right now. This puzzle, this puzzle is coming together so great"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3322760","3329720"," right now, right? It's kind of hard to deny at this point. So how do you trade this as a trader,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3329720","3336360"," right? As your questioner, as an investor, a long-term investor, you can come back in this video"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3336360","3343160"," later on and you can look to see when you can go long again. You can't take long here. You have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3343240","3349480"," to find out this week into the end of the month and most specifically as an investor,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3349480","3356520"," you're waiting for June 30th. You need to see that we didn't close a bad Q2. If we didn't close"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3356520","3362120"," a bad Q2, corrections over. I'll give the bulls that correction is over. We don't we close green"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3362120","3367320"," Q2 corrections over. I promise you, if you're a bull out there, if you're a long-term investor,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3367320","3375400"," and we do not close a green Q2, right? The pain is going to continue. The pain is going to continue."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3378520","3379720"," Let's see what you guys are talking about."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3383080","3387720"," Okay, good question. So Sydney's asking, Captain, which downside do you wish for?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3387720","3390840"," Let's go back to that. I'm going to give you a good answer to this. You guys ready for this?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3391720","3399320"," This is this is the first crash we had here, okay? I want to show you that this crash took three years"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3401320","3406760"," and even at that three years, the last bit of capitulation was three years later."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3407560","3412840"," Fake out, fake out, fake out. This is what this is what kills the last bull right here, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3413960","3419800"," For a year and a half, they just destroyed bulls. So even if you picked the right bottom down here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3419800","3424200"," you could have been annihilated and thought, we're going to continue down here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3425560","3429000"," And this took forever, three years. I don't want that. I don't think you want that. I think"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3429000","3433640"," with the information age, we're not going to get this. But what happened in late when we had this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3433640","3439240"," major crash? This is what I want to see. I want to see major capitulation down here quickly."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3439240","3443320"," This could take a month and a half or so. This could take it in July 1, let's say."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3444040","3448680"," We might get one more lower low. This could be October. But what happened after?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3449800","3456840"," What happened after that happened? A massive run. See that massive run? So if you're a bull,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3456840","3461640"," if you're an investor, a long-term investor, what are you looking for? You're looking for some"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3461640","3466840"," capitulation. You want this done and over with. You want to see us be done and over with."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3467960","3473880"," How do we get this to take place? We get this to take place in a year from now. This would be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3473880","3478440"," end of year, right? This would be end of year with your last bottom."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3479640","3485960"," And then what you'd see is inflation come down. You'd see shortages of bait. You'd see companies"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3485960","3493720"," give better, better Ford guidance on their on their on their Q1, 2, 3, 4 in or their next year,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3493720","3500840"," 2023 guidances. And then you'd see this move higher. If we have not abated inflation,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3501400","3506920"," if we've not abated shortages at the end of this year, you're going to see us continue down,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3506920","3513080"," believe it or not, into 2023 and 2024. This would be something like a long-term debt cycle"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3513080","3520040"," instead of a short-term debt cycle. Yesterday, I posted a video where Ray Dalio talked about"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3520040","3523800"," short-term, long-term debt cycles. This would be the long-term debt cycle in here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3524440","3529480"," This is where you'd see that capitulation move down farther for the next one to three years,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3529480","3533480"," one and a half to three years. If this is a short-term debt cycle,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3533480","3539320"," you'd see us end this move, right? I'd say by end of year, and then we'd start moving up."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3540920","3544520"," And this is a nice bounce down. You'd see some that you'd see this nice capitulation move,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3544520","3548840"," nice bounce higher, bounce down lower. We probably retest some lows around 3,200,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3548840","3552360"," and then we'd rocket ship higher. Something like that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3552360","3560280"," And history doesn't repeat itself, but I'll tell you what, man,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3560840","3566200"," it's pretty fucking close to some extent. I'll tell you what, if you want to look at market"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3566200","3571320"," structure, this is what it looks like. If you guys are looking for this market to go up and be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3571320","3576440"," done with it, you need some catalysts, and we don't have them right now. All right,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3576440","3582280"," let me look at your comments right now. It's BTC, the same as SPX, no."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3586680","3589640"," I have my UVX calls, so much knowledge. Yeah, thanks a little Jeep."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3590920","3596840"," Okay, so that's the macro view for you guys. Today's a Sunday. I want you guys to understand"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3596840","3601960"," that this is a macro view for where the market's headed. I want you to have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3602600","3607240"," these goal and that goal post, but these markers on the road, what you're looking for for where"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3607240","3611160"," we should be trading to next. It doesn't really, if you have this information, it doesn't matter"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3611160","3615720"," if we if we sell down and have a black Monday and tomorrow, it doesn't matter if we trade up to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3615720","3622120"," 410 reverse, you'll know we're headed. If we trade above 410, 415, you know where the next stop is,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3622120","3628120"," right? We're heading now towards that 451 friend of June. If you see, if you see us break above"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3628200","3633320"," and close Q2, you know that everything is over. You already know that if we trade higher to all"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3633320","3638840"," time highs, the feds going to continue to be relentless in raising rates. You know that if we"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3638840","3644920"," trade down to 360 or 320, that you could probably put a fair bet in that the Fed is not going to do"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3644920","3651880"," any more rate increases after June. You'll probably get that in the minutes of July in July at some"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3651880","3657960"," point, right? And they'll let the market trade inside that 320 to 400 zone. They'll wait and"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3657960","3661960"," see again, right? You're back to that wait and see phase. Are we in a short term that's like a"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3661960","3669080"," long term debt cycle? There are no catalysts for us to go up without the Fed changing what their"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3669080","3674120"," what the Fed is with what J. Pao is saying. I want to be aware of that. I also want you to know"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3674120","3677960"," that there are catalysts in the market. Take us there. I want you to understand that there are"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3677960","3682360"," catalysts with what's going on the crypto space, that there are banks that are over leveraged in"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3682360","3687880"," the crypto space. I want you to realize that they're already cutting the legs off of the major players."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3688440","3691880"," I want you to see that these things are in the market right now. I want you to see"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3691880","3699240"," that there's a huge, huge, no, or no, not no, but but expiry of puts in June coming into that June"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3699240","3705640"," op-ex of the seven on the 17th. I want you guys to know that these that these in the the internals"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3705640","3710680"," of the market are different than what you think are actually happening. We can chart this out all"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3710680","3716840"," day long, but there are actual internal market internals that say otherwise. There are magnets"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3716840","3722680"," for us to be pulled down into the op-ex of June. And then you just look at market structure where"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3722680","3728120"," we are in the market. Now, can there be this big like once in a lifetime, we ripped all the time"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3728120","3733720"," highs and we just go crazy? Sure. But I don't I don't think it's before at least the short-term"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3733720","3737960"," capitulation move. I think you guys I think we're on the wrong track here with hey, we're going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3737960","3743080"," go to all time highs as of this Friday. We can and I'll trade each level as we do. I'll trade to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3743160","3747720"," the right every day. You guys know that. And you guys know where to trade these levels as we move"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3747720","3753720"," forward. But I do want you don't know about this 360 level 364. I want you to know about the big"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3753720","3759000"," node down at 320. I want you to know about where we need to be at end of Q2. I'll actually type"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3759000","3763960"," I'll type in some some verbiage in here. So you guys know what levels you're looking for,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3763960","3769080"," the major levels as we trade forward. I do want I do want you to know that my take on this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3769160","3772600"," is that it's going to be 2008. If you want to know what I what I hope happens,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3772600","3777720"," I hope we have 2008. I really do. I hope that we have a huge capitulation move. It gives some"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3777720","3782120"," breathing room to the market. It gives breathing room to the Fed. They can stop with the with the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3782120","3787880"," negative Nancy stuff. It gives a chance for us to not to not be looking over our shoulders. I mean,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3787880","3792920"," how many of you guys out there good girls out there, men out there, women out there, them out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3792920","3797240"," there? How many are you tired of looking over your shoulder? How many aren't you all just tired of"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3797240","3801560"," that? I can't buy anything in this market. You know, you can buy in this market right now,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3801560","3806840"," oil and gas. That's it. It's all you can buy in this market in safety. There's some other small"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3806840","3813240"," tickers. There's a value trade in there coming up if we hit this bottom as a value trade. But"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3813240","3818040"," still, do you guys like looking over your shoulders day in day out being a bull? That's insane."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3818040","3824200"," If you're a bear, if we go down a 360 or 320 and you're a bear, you have to be able to cut it loose"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3824200","3828680"," too, because they're going to trade higher if we do. You guys get the bears are going to be back"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3828680","3833720"," in that with the bull situation is they're going to have to wait at that point. It's not going to be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3833720","3839640"," down a 360, 320, and then we're going to bloodbath it down to 150. Mike Barry can suck a dick. That"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3839640","3844440"," ain't happening. That shouldn't happen in the next three months. I'm sorry. It's not such a far"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3844440","3850440"," tail risk. It's like a 1% chance of that happening. So even the bull, even the bears have something"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3850440","3854040"," to look forward to in the short term of that happens. For the same time, they know they have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3854040","3858680"," to pack it up at that point statistically and probably with the probability wise,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3859480","3862680"," the probability is that they would have to pack it up down there as well."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3866200","3871640"," I love wheat too. I love wheat. Come on, everybody."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3873640","3877800"," Yeah, we should talk about pharma as well. We can tell a farmer there's some value stuff out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3877880","3882360"," there. There's some housing stocks out there, housing construction stocks that are good."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3883560","3887560"," There's some value stocks. I'll get a list together for you guys. I'll show you guys. I've"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3887560","3892280"," got a bunch of stocks. Dude, yesterday on Twitter, I was going to pump a bunch of stocks yesterday"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3892280","3894600"," on Twitter. I got some buys out there for you."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3896520","3899240"," Tesla, if you're taking off, you have a great morning. All right. So if you guys have any"

"j_hdYynhmTU","3906760","3914280"," Don't go crazy with them. I don't think they can. I don't think you're going to see QT like you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3914280","3920840"," think you are. So QT doesn't all just involve the equities market. QT involves the bond market,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3920840","3932360"," the RFPs. I don't think you're going to see QT in the package that's being presented. I'll say that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3932360","3939240"," I'll say that. Good morning, little big bear. Cost here. I was going to be a bloodbath this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3939240","3943640"," week. Feel like it'll spark a similar reaction to that TGT yet. Yeah, absolutely. I agree with that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3944680","3949640"," I love wheat. Wheat's actually come down, right? Wheat's coming down to a support level."

"j_hdYynhmTU","3960280","3966920"," best strategies that you can have is on any rip to buy what's called a putback spread."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3968200","3973880"," I want you to hold on here. I want you guys to Google search out there, putback spreads."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3974440","3980040"," They make money if the market goes up or down. Putback spreads, ratio spreads are also known as."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3980600","3984600"," It's a way for you to hedge your longs in this market, especially if you're long in big tech."
"j_hdYynhmTU","3984600","3992600"," Good question, Zach. What's your taste of taking the housing market?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","3993320","4000040"," I had a very bearish take on the housing markets. I don't see the housing market coming down now."

"j_hdYynhmTU","4100680","4105160"," they're faster and they don't last as long. So a bear market today might only last a year and a"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4105160","4112520"," half instead of three years. A crash might come faster than seeing us continue higher back here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4112520","4116600"," right? Instead of having this one, this one blow off top, we just start crashing because"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4116600","4121880"," everybody knows. The other thing is the Fed has become more transparent. The Fed used to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4121960","4126120"," make a surprise at their Fed meetings. They'd come out and drop some stupid shit on you that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4126120","4132600"," you didn't expect. We have like a new Fed where the Fed pre-tells us what to expect and that the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4132600","4137800"," market better act with what the Fed is saying. So it's like a new relationship with the Fed where"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4137800","4144920"," the Fed says, you do it for us or we'll do it for you. Now, even with all that new information age,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4145800","4153240"," the time of real life doesn't always catch up to that. You're not going to get an oil producer."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4153240","4159800"," You're not going to get some guy down in Texas that is going to reinvest in equipment or new wells."

"j_hdYynhmTU","4234040","4240840"," So that part of that part of the market cycle, we're not going to have as much impact on."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4241560","4248040"," We'll shorten it, but not like we not like the information age and how quick we are having"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4248120","4253320"," sell offs. You saw it in March 2020. We had we had a capitulation move then, right? We had a market"

"j_hdYynhmTU","4258600","4264840"," And you're you're going to see the the you're going to see the acceleration of what we can do,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4264840","4269960"," what the market can do, what the Fed can do, but you're not going to see it from real people. So"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4269960","4275000"," if you're asking me, do I think that the housing my initial thought was, yeah, the house market's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4275000","4280920"," going to crash. But I had to rethink that thought process because the information ages is is"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4282040","4286920"," distorting when the when the housing market should actually come back down to reality."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4286920","4292280"," That's probably not we're probably not at that stage. It's probably a year and a half down the"

"j_hdYynhmTU","4298200","4303960"," Would you buy a monthly Tesla? Would I buy a monthly Tesla pulls? I don't I don't buy Tesla"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4303960","4309480"," puts. I own short Tesla. So I'm not going to answer that question for you. Do you trade live"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4309480","4315080"," regularly? Where I have a live stream every morning, Monday through Friday? Well, most mornings when"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4315080","4324120"," I can do it. And I trade live with with everybody. Any thoughts on gold and silver? No, you guys go"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4324200","4329240"," back and just watch the you guys have to fucking go back and watch the you guys have to go back"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4329240","4336040"," and watch the hunt brothers. That shit is so manipulated fucking. Yeah, do I think gold can"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4336040","4341880"," come up? Sure. I don't trade gold anymore. For that reason. I love I'm not saying it's not a bad"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4341880","4347640"," if you're if you're in a gold, so be it. I can't be in it. I try to make money in the S&P 500."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4347640","4354280"," Simple. It's easy. It's consistent. What field of Fed have after capitulation base Fed rate was"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4354280","4364920"," 6% in 2008. 0.75% now. Yeah, I think 5% about right. I don't know what UVX calls and have to see what"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4364920","4370920"," they are when you bought them much paid for them. I mean, this name is delivery with gas prices"

"j_hdYynhmTU","4388600","4396680"," sure. Rec real estate. Yeah, don't I if you look at, you got I'll drop some real estate tickers for"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4396680","4402200"," you. I'll put some up on the captain's alph on Twitter. Do I think the VIX can explode this week?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4402840","4411080"," Only if we go to 360 before June. Yeah, it's right. JP Morgan is Silver's nightmare."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4413400","4418360"," Comment on Tesla split to new factories, Ergo. Yeah, I'll I'll post the list."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4418360","4426840"," List of splits. I'll post a list of what happens post split to most companies. They go down"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4428280","4436840"," like 95% of the time. TLT. Good question. David's as well. TLT. Yes, I think there's a whisper in"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4436840","4442760"," the neighborhood saying, I think there's going to be a bid and bonds. Yes, that's what they're"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4442760","4445240"," running the market. They're not going to put in the equity is more than to put in bonds."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4445960","4450280"," I'm also though still afraid that TLT. If we do have that capitulation moving to June,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4450280","4456440"," that even if bonds go up next week or two next six weeks that you still see TLT get whacked"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4457640","4462680"," if we get that last capitulation. So yeah, you can trade TLT. I'd rather just trade the spy"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4463320","4469080"," than trade TLT for the next few weeks, both ways. But yeah, you could. But I would be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4469160","4474680"," one thing I would say to you is just like just like just like just like just like XLP getting"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4474680","4481800"," whacked. You saw XLP get whacked last week. It would it would not shock me to see TLT get whacked"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4481800","4489000"," if we get a huge leg down the next next five weeks. You're like you TLT moves up. You missed"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4489000","4496120"," the trade in S&P 500. And you have to stay in that trade for TLT for one good print. Meanwhile,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4496120","4502040"," you can get tick ass prints in the spy. And then if if TLT gets whacked once more with the market"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4502040","4508600"," affair, there'll be panic and bonds as well. So I don't know, like I like the TLT trade"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4508600","4514440"," and under normal circumstances. I don't like it right now. For me personally, but I can understand"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4514440","4523320"," someone want to take that trade. What else you guys got? Yeah, shame. I'd have to do this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4523320","4529640"," off stream with you to find out what's up where you're at. Any thoughts on this GameStop squeeze"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4529640","4536200"," thing? Are you talking about Moass with you talking about Moass is going to come in the next"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4536200","4541160"," week or two? I got to be honest with you guys out there. You got some of you guys know, know me a"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4541160","4546360"," long time. I was in the original GameStop trade. And I don't and I'm not talking about where these"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4546360","4555480"," documentaries say it started. I was in that trade in like December months before March"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4555480","4561720"," from all the retail traders were at home. I'm going to tell you guys, I got to tell you guys"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4562600","4566360"," what the first time when they shut it down, right? I want to warn you guys out there."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4567640","4575320"," If you guys go back to when VW did this in Germany, they put protections so that it wouldn't happen"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4575320","4585960"," again. I want you to know that the system is built for you to lose. And if you pull one over"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4585960","4594040"," on the hedge funds in the banks, you then have to find something new to get one over on the hedge"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4594040","4601080"," funds and banks. So can you have a situation like what took place in December into March, April?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4601560","4609240"," Happen again? Yes. Does it happen with GameStop more than likely not? Does it happen the same way"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4609880","4615960"," as GameStop more than likely not? Are there going to be squeezes in GameStop? Yes."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4616680","4621320"," There'll always be squeezes in GameStop because there's sharks in there. There's other banks"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4621320","4629000"," and other hedge funds. It's a playground. But do you see the moas? No. You don't. I want to warn"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4629000","4635240"," you of that. I think that the chance of that happening is about 5%. It's very low."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4636680","4640360"," You have to understand that you have to understand that these rich, fat, old,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4640360","4646600"," fucking white guys. Once they find out what you got over on them, you have to do something different."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4646600","4652920"," Think about it like this. Think about like, um, think about like, uh, like with a magpies, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4652920","4659400"," Or crows, right? You know that a crow, if you are nice to it, it remembers that."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4660040","4665240"," If you're nasty to a crow, they'll remember that. Banks don't forget."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4666040","4672360"," Hedge funds don't forget. This is what they do. These are the smartest guys in the room. So when"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4672360","4678360"," you beat the smartest guy in the room, right? They not only write it all down, but they play that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4678360","4684520"," game with you as a retail trader. So do I think it's going to happen again? I'm going to tell"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4684520","4692040"," you, man, like probably not. They actually, GME is now part of a basket of risk on stocks"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4693080","4699960"," to squeeze played by hedge funds and banks. It's a part of a package of risk. So when you see it"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4699960","4706760"," squeeze, oftentimes that is actually a part of a program of a hedge fund and a bank. It's not"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4706840","4714920"," really what you think it is. Do I have a price target for RK and growth? Seems like they have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4714920","4719640"," been declining less these days. That's a good question. Let's talk about RK real quick, Brian."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4719640","4724280"," I want you guys to understand that the initial, I want you guys to see something. I'm going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4724280","4728520"," do somebody real quick. Let's have a car. Let's have a drink real quick. We're going to talk about"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4728520","4734120"," some cool. Let's have a toast. I'm going to have a drink today. Let's have a toast."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4740760","4751800"," I want to talk to you guys about some. I want to stick it here. I've got the guys are"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4751800","4758600"," coming to move on today, Sunday. I want to show you guys something. If a stock peaks,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4762440","4768920"," this is the peak. Let's do this better. Let's do it better way. We have the accumulation phase,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4771480","4776440"," we have the belief in the thrill phase, right? Wait a minute. Hold on here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4777160","4785640"," There's a cool thing. There's a cool thing. We've got boom, hope. We've got optimism over here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4785640","4793160"," right? We've got belief over here. We've got the thrill of the ride over here. Then we have you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4793160","4803000"," for you. You guys all tracking along with this, the accumulation, let's say RK. You have that"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4803880","4808760"," that topping pattern over here, right? You start to have these steep declines over here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4812440","4824840"," Let's say this over here was 70%. Then you have some further decline over here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4825720","4836040"," This one's pretty nasty, right? This is like a 30%. Not 30, like the tallest, like 20% or something."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4841560","4845240"," Then you have like your last 5% over here"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4846040","4849880"," and your last 5% over here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4852840","4861800"," Now, this initial decline right here, if it were to swing higher, it doesn't take that much"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4861800","4869240"," for it to come back percentage-wise. It's all time high, it's 30%, not so bad. When you're down"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4869320","4877160"," here, right, for it to come back, it's like 200, 300%. When it's down here, and you're like,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4877160","4885080"," hey, look, you're like RK came up 5% or 30% or whatever. The returns that you need back here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4885080","4893960"," believe it or not, right? This is like 200%. This is like 4 or 500%. You need the stock to come back"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4894840","4899960"," 500%. This last part down here, it's like 900%."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4903480","4909400"," So let's say you held this all the way down and you didn't have a putback spread. You didn't have"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4909400","4916520"," a some kind of hedge for RK. If it continues down here and you just hold down, let's say you hold"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4916600","4924840"," this from the peak to let's say peak trough, let's say you got in here and you're up here in RK"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4924840","4930120"," and we're finally way down here. You're going to say to yourself, holy shit, it's going up,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4931080","4937240"," but we've got years ahead of us. And you start to realize that that accumulation phase in RK,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4937240","4941400"," even if it doesn't crash and burn or even if Kathy doesn't go bankrupt or whatever,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4941880","4945000"," talking about like no failure in Kathy Woods, no failure in RK."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4946600","4951000"," Even then, you'll notice then that what it takes for you to not just make it back"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4952840","4956600"," and then become profitable again after all those years, you're going to get fucked."
"j_hdYynhmTU","4957480","4964360"," So there are some strategies. There are some strategies to counter this by buying the dip"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4964360","4971960"," all the way down. But the one thing I want to warn you is that if it recovers,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4973240","4979320"," what it takes for it to recover is insane. You can't really call a bottom. I think I have,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4980120","4987080"," you can call bottoms or places to add and look to see if we continue higher or if we roll over"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4987080","4994280"," and go down. But I do want you to realize that as we go forward with RK that if you're just"
"j_hdYynhmTU","4994440","5000760"," long, you shouldn't be. You should be hedging your longs in RK. You should also,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5000760","5003640"," if you want to buy the dip all the way down and hedge, I think it's probably the best"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5004600","5010360"," program for RK or any other ticker or ETF for that matter. You should be well hedged and you"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5010360","5017080"," should also buy significant areas, right? This is a significant area here. 360 is a significant"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5017080","5023160"," area, 350. 320 is a significant area, right? We know down here is a significant area,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5023240","5028120"," probably one right here too, right down here at 280, 300 is a significant area. So you can do"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5028120","5031080"," all that all the way down. If we trade higher from here and you've been hedged all the way down,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5032280","5039000"," if you trade to the right, then you'll make money and accumulate cash for the turnaround to come back."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5042120","5045880"," Thank you, Binky. Let's talk about market breath indicator."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5047480","5050200"," Let's talk about market breath indicator. Let's look at the market breath indicator."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5050920","5056600"," We should see a bounce here. We always do get a bounce here. That's not going to save the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5056600","5060840"," market breath indicator from the video because I've gone through it on crashes on what you need"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5060840","5065000"," to do on the market breath indicator. You guys know that I've told you that when we have the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5065000","5070200"," market breath indicator, even if we go down here, let's see, you bought your call spread down here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5070200","5073800"," even if we were to sell off, we'd come back up and we'd put enough time on them, right?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5073800","5078520"," I told you that. So I said, if we're down here, the market breath indicator is at zero,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5078520","5082600"," even if we have a market crash, if you took them for like a month and a half, two months out,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5082600","5087800"," you'd still see a V-shaped recovery at some point that would pay those out to you. I even showed"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5087800","5095880"," you the crash in 2020, I showed you the crash in 2008 and 2000, those crashes that still bounce"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5095880","5103000"," back. But the times that would have lost if it didn't put enough time on them. So down here,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5103080","5107080"," when we're that this nasty at this time, you put a three month in the money call spread out"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5108200","5113640"," to so they can clean out all the call buying back here. I'll do a video on this tomorrow and Monday."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5115240","5119320"," This is a good, I'll do this tomorrow morning for you so you can see how to structure these so"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5119320","5122760"," they don't ever fail. Then you get like a hundred percent hit rate on these, but"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5127160","5131160"," yeah, I certainly have a good chance for a relief bounce. I'm down for a relief bounce."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5133960","5137640"," I'll do that video tomorrow. Come on early tomorrow and show you guys what I'm talking about"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5137640","5145640"," with the market breath indicator. You guys can go back and watch this video again and see what"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5145640","5148920"," I'm trying to talk to you guys about giving you guys the levels that you're looking for."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5149640","5155160"," My take is that we trade higher into 400 to 410. We get a rejection, we start trading down to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5155240","5162840"," 316 in a June. That's what my plan is. If you really want to know, let's go back in a three"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5162840","5172760"," month here. You want to know what I think is going to happen? I'll show you. So here's June 27th,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5172760","5180680"," right, June 30th or so. What I think is going to happen between now and then,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5180680","5194440"," something like this. There it is. Something like that and it could go up here. It can come up here."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5195240","5200440"," I think it's something like that. I think that's what you get coming to you. I think that's what's"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5200440","5207640"," planned out. We could go down here now, but this is the only way that the VIX prints."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5208520","5220760"," The VIX won't print this. We'll get well hedged all the way down there, but it's something like this."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5224520","5229000"," Yeah, the only way that I could trade, the only way that I, on Friday, the only thing that I was"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5229000","5235000"," willing to do on Friday clothes was to pick something up and down. I was unwell. You know,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5235000","5237880"," you could have done it, but no, there's the only thing that I thought you could do would be,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5238840","5244360"," and you probably best case scenario would take a weekly out on Friday for a Friday expiry,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5245000","5249320"," and you pick an outside the money up here and down. That's probably the better trade. I was"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5249320","5253000"," just taking some zero dates that I could wait and sleep through the weekend and not worry,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5253800","5259720"," because I think there is risk of us having a black Monday, small risk, but it's there. I think"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5259720","5264520"," the likely trade scenarios that we trade up on Monday, I think that's the most likely scenario,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5264520","5270280"," but because of where we are, but because of what's going on this week,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5270280","5276840"," front running happening, there's a risk of us trading, of them front running it. That's what"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5276840","5283720"," Kapi was saying, right, that they could front run early, start front running the market lower lows."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5289320","5292760"," Okay, so I'm going to get off with you guys today at this point. I hope you guys had a wonderful"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5293320","5297480"," time with me. I appreciate you guys showing up on a Sunday with me. It's already one 30s,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5297480","5302600"," it's been an hour and a half. Yeah, so well, let's have one last conversation."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5304440","5310040"," In the next week or so, in the next coming days, I have a problem out there, okay?"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5311720","5319720"," The time and the cost of producing this content. I'm having issues with payment"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5319720","5325960"," processors. I'm being forced into some kind of a paid plan. It's still donations,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5327720","5333320"," but it has to be where you're there is exchange for specific things. They don't like the tipping."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5334440","5338440"," I've explained this in a previous video. We're going to switch the system here. It's going to"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5338440","5342600"," turn into something where you're either going to get, you're either going to get like the discordably"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5342600","5350920"," free, but to get trade the news, the options flow and the live stream most of the day"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5350920","5358120"," is going to have to go behind some kind of a monthly donation. And then I'll do a live stream"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5358120","5365960"," that's open to the public in the mornings and probably a Sunday stock picking thing with you guys,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5365960","5370200"," or something like we did today that's free. So you get like a free morning show,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5370200","5375880"," let's say 8.30 to 9.30, and then like a Sunday show. You'll still see me post on Twitter."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5375880","5380040"," You'll still have access to at Captain's Alpha. You'll still have access to the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5382120","5389880"," discord, but for the stuff that cost me a lot of money, it's costing me somewhere between 20,000"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5389880","5395880"," a year. And then that does include any of the time as well. So, or I'll shut it down. If I"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5395880","5401880"," piss everybody off, I wanted this to be free, but it's turning into where I'm being I'm being"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5401880","5409320"," forced into either shutting it all down, or I have to look for some some channel supporters"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5410760","5415080"," to keep this going. And it's I think it helps. I like you guys being with you guys the same."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5415800","5419400"," So if it so what I'll do is I'll try this. I'm going to try to roll out a new program."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5420280","5424440"," I'm going to try to be as not even try. I'm going to be is I'm going to try to be"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5425160","5431320"," as transparent as possible so that you guys see that I'm not trying to make bank off this or"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5431320","5438040"," anything or get rich or anything. And I think every quarter or so I'm going to show what I'm"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5438040","5444360"," making for money when my costs are so that if we can drop the price we can to run this stream."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5445160","5450920"," So I'm going to have to have the change. I'm being forced from basically social media is"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5450920","5458040"," forcing me to change the payment processors are forcing me to change how I do this and how I put"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5458040","5463880"," this content out. And that's so that sucks. So we're going to try something if it works. It works."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5463880","5467800"," If it doesn't work, if people are turned off by it or don't feel like they're getting their value"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5467800","5472600"," for it, I'll just shut the entire thing down. You just I won't do any of it. I'll just do"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5473560","5480200"," Twitter and I'll just trade on my own and trade with you guys. We had a we had a long conversation"

"j_hdYynhmTU","5922840","5928520"," want to launch until it's right. And it'll tell you exactly what you're getting. You're also going"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5928520","5934760"," to see a slight change from me how I present myself to you. You'll see more consistency out of me"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5934760","5937960"," because of course, if you're paying for something, I have to fucking be there with for you."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5939880","5944920"," And then, but what I loved about the previous format was that come and go as they pleased."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5946120","5951080"," And we'll see if this works. We'll try it out for a few months, five months, six months. If it"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5951080","5956360"," doesn't work, we'll just shut it down. We'll just go back to fucking around on the internet."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5957160","5960760"," We can do if we shut the whole entire thing down, we'll just do it where I get on Twitter,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5961240","5967080"," in fucking, we'll just do it that way. It's simpler that way. It's easier that way. Everybody wins"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5967080","5972680"," that way. But I want one last thing. The cost of this, I want you to think about how much money"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5972680","5976440"," you lose in the market. I want you to think about how much you're paying for services out there. I"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5976440","5981080"," want you to think about when you have losing trades or look at your whole year of P&L and"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5981080","5986360"," how much money you've lost. Look at, look at, look at what you're paying for services for trades."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5986360","5989800"," If you pay, I pay for trades. But if you pay for trades, I know you guys pay more than"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5989800","5993160"," fucking 30 bucks a month in trades. Fucking know you do. If you're not,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","5993160","5998440"," you're paying for it in the order selling, in the order flow selling. So stick around."
"j_hdYynhmTU","5999480","6008520"," We'll do this. We're still doing the challenge. Right now, I don't want to do the challenge"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6008520","6014360"," because I'm rolling this stuff over. We were still doing the challenge. But as I make this"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6014360","6018760"," transition, I don't want to start there. And also the danger of the market at this moment."
"j_hdYynhmTU","6019960","6024840"," It's probably not appropriate to start it this week. So I will."
"j_hdYynhmTU","6030920","6033080"," Yeah, I think you would agree with that, Tegan."
"j_hdYynhmTU","6036360","6040520"," It doesn't have to be that complicated, does it? I'll tell you what, as a bull,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6041960","6046120"," one thing I've noticed as a bull is that it's easier at this market since January."
"j_hdYynhmTU","6046760","6050040"," It's easier right now as a bull to place a trade and walk away from it for a month,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6050040","6054520"," month and a half. But I'll tell you the truth, with just the limit sell on your trade,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6054520","6057000"," you just go back down to your basement and come back out in a month or so."
"j_hdYynhmTU","6058280","6062600"," But the bears like tuning in. The bears love it. I've had more bears in this stream since the"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6062600","6067960"," market rolled over than fucking, then we were going, when we were going up. Bears love it."
"j_hdYynhmTU","6069400","6072680"," You guys have a great day. I'll talk to you guys soon. I'm going to log out. Well,"
"j_hdYynhmTU","6073000","6075240"," I'm going to let one last toast with you. I want to say,"
