"136880","138920"," How are you all doing this morning?"
"141740","144320"," Looks like we've got some people here this morning."
"144620","145460"," Someone showed up."
"146420","148280"," Let me, I don't know if that's two. "
"149580","150340"," It changed."
"150680","159890"," I was asked last night as I was asked to change some of that real quick here, the chat box."
"160390","163710"," I got asked last night why I put a chat box. "
"166360","172760"," I'm going to change the size of the chat box font size."
"174460","175340"," Try 28."
"178630","188150"," Why I put the chat box on is because not all, not all viewers have chat, some smart TV show"
"188150","193990"," chats, some don't, some people watch on their laptops and they hit the expand button. "
"197340","199420"," Make sure the chat box is running here."
"202990","209390"," I changed the format of the chat box, but some of you are watching on TV's and want to be"
"209390","215370"," able to see what's going on in chat to have context for questions that are in the chat or"
"215370","219490"," discussions wherever we're at in the program."
"220130","221210"," So there it is for you. "
"222010","224910"," Good morning to you all out there for joining us this morning."

"227510","233510"," I was trying to launch a live stream, the first multi stream this morning on Twitch and YouTube,"
"234050","235930"," but I guess I'm doing something wrong. "
"236250","239890"," So more than likely at some point later today, you'll see me."
"241490","244370"," Trying a new live stream at some point with a test."

"439120","440060"," Good job asking Red Drift. "
"441620","445800"," Before we get anything else, let's talk about the market conditions where we are in the market."
"445800","447200"," What's going on in the market."
"448480","449420"," Let's start there. "
"449600","452340"," I thought we were going to be able to do a Twitch rollout today, but that didn't happen."
"452520","453540"," So we'll try to get that shit."
"454280","456400"," After today's stream, I'll try to run it. "
"459440","469220"," And so Winky's talking about 3.31.23.97.C "
"469220","471760",".92.P. on Amazon."
"478270","479150"," Modern Herms."
"479570","479930"," Rowley. "
"480030","480350"," Good morning."
"481870","483650"," Yeah, let's take a look and see what's going on here."
"483750","485150"," There's a couple of things we got to look at this morning. "
"485610","486170"," Number one."
"488820","490620"," You want to close all this stuff, right?"
"490680","492820"," We always talk about the H line, right?"
"494380","498000"," I deleted it now, but that PT2 is up here."
"498500","499400"," Clama Blanca. "
"500080","502000"," That PT2 is right up here, okay?"
"504360","505720"," And PT3 is still above."
"506260","509020"," Now another thing though is we gapped up to an extent, right?"
"509120","510860"," We left behind a pretty decent gap."
"513440","517380"," What's really good here is you try to find out what the closing price was from yesterday. "
"518059","521559"," Now I haven't checked at this point, but you always want to check it."
"521659","522559"," What is the closing price?"
"523820","525500"," The closing price of the spy."
"530170","532270"," That's where we're on this morning is the spy, right?"
"533590","537630"," So I haven't checked yet this morning to find out, and I haven't looked yet to see what ES was. "
"538410","545490"," But I feel like the H line is typically pivot points, closing prices, closing gaps, that kind of"
"545490","545730"," stuff."
"546470","547570"," We hit the target on high."
"548710","550230"," Yesterday's closing price was what?"
"550930","558010"," It was $3.98.54, and we're at $3.98.46 right now, right?"
"558930","563470"," So this is the official close, $3.98.54. So right here. "
"564670","566830"," And look where we're at right now, right at this moment."
"567770","574860"," $3.98.58. So just like a little robot, they come back down."
"575240","576440"," They hit that pivot point. "
"576680","577900"," This is an H line, okay?"
"578860","583240"," This is the closing price yesterday, getting a little bit of a bounce right off here, right?"
"583920","585920"," These are the robots coming into play."
"587000","591600"," One of the first things you do every morning before you come on to the market, you want to take"
"591600","594240"," a look at some previous lows in ES overnight."
"594240","599680"," You want to look at when you're doing your levels, you want to be checking for when you're setting"
"599680","602340"," your own levels, where you know where your pivot is, where you know your support. "
"602340","610200"," Sorry, your resistance is are you want to check previous lows, previous highs, your previous"
"610200","611120"," clothes and all that stuff."
"611300","617830"," That's how you calculate support levels and resistance levels in the market, right?"
"618090","622210"," And then you want to also just remember some of these previous highs and lows."
"622210","625630"," So if we're looking back to yesterday, we know there's another one down here, right?"
"627510","631730"," This is the previous low from yesterday, right down here, 397. "
"633130","633610"," O2."
"635510","637130"," Okay, so we know where the lows are."
"637690","639910"," We know where the highs are from yesterday. "
"640170","643690"," We actually sold off right there."
"644890","646370"," Well, the previous high was yesterday."
"646910","648810"," We talked about yesterday. "
"649330","651990"," There's a yellow box up here and then a red box above."
"655100","658840"," So you're going to, your expectation here is we're going to clean up this mess down below, right?"
"659060","661340"," In cash market, we're going to close all that gapage up."
"662240","664780"," And we're going to see if the bulls still want it here. "
"664860","665960"," Now, we're on the one minute chart."
"668580","670520"," So first things we're going to do this morning."
"671700","674680"," And we're, we just bounced actually, you can't see it on your screen. "
"674820","675960"," I'll show it to you in a minute here."
"675960","683400"," But we did just bounce off of the, the daily trigger, I believe."
"683600","684640"," Hold on, let me check this, make sure. "
"688500","690080"," No, we just bounced off the weekly trigger."
"690360","690640"," Outstanding."
"691140","691640"," It's even better. "
"692720","694340"," This is a hard bounce right here."
"694660","700660"," So just below here, that weekly trigger that was here yesterday or lower yesterday has now actually"
"700660","701340"," moved up."
"702140","705540"," So there's a little, so this remember yesterday when I had this green bar down here. "
"706460","707420"," Two green bars."
"707620","710340"," Now, as I care as your weekly and your monthly, this is some big buyers."
"710940","712780"," They've actually moved up at this point. "
"712940","716040"," So this is some pretty serious support down below."
"717200","721740"," And this is what will push the market up until it meets up with sellers."
"722180","724900"," This market is coiling like crazy. "
"726120","733540"," There's some, some massive velocity that's been building for 14 months."
"735020","737100"," And I'll explain it to you better later."
"737300","741400"," This morning, if I have a chance, I'll go over historically how this momentum works. "
"743760","745700"," And this is part of the soft landing."
"746140","747280"," Now, do we get a soft landing?"
"747500","747880"," I don't know."
"748100","752600"," But I know one of the parts, one of the, one of the mechanics of a soft landing. "
"753720","757120"," Is that the longer they trade the market down in sideways."
"759720","764760"," There, there's some math behind why a soft landing might work."
"765560","771260"," And, and truly over time, the more the trade sideways, the more the trade it down and the longer"
"771260","772280"," that that goes on. "
"773300","776060"," The more likelihood that the market becomes supported."
"777320","782800"," And it's hard to, hard to fathom or scratch your heads over the faster that we crash."
"784360","789460"," The more likely that at some point when we bottom out, it's hitting those momentum, right?"
"789640","793740"," Those, or those lower, lower, deep levels of the, of the stock market. "
"794720","798940"," So you either have, so you either have time on your hands spread out, right?"
"799180","801120"," Just think of it like this very simply, right?"
"801120","805740"," You either have time on your hands or the market trade sideways and momentum catches up to you"
"805740","809400"," eventually as time passes or you have a market crash."
"810320","815000"," And you start going straight through down levels until you reach those depths of the market."
"815620","817080"," So you see, you have those two options. "
"817740","821700"," That is part of the idea behind a soft landing."
"822860","827260"," If that's not really doing anything, well, not really doing anything."
"827400","831560"," They just know that as time passes, the destruction will be less. "
"832080","841040"," And the crazy part about this is that they kind of have almost an assured soft landing to some"
"841040","842820"," extent over time."
"844800","848940"," Okay, so I know that's hard to believe, but if you do it on a graph on a piece of"
"848940","850700"," graph paper, you're like, oh, I get it now."
"852080","854400"," The stock market could be up to six or 700. "
"855340","859340"," If we had let it continue on the high, just cranking out of control."
"860060","863540"," When you start to spread a chart out over 20 years ago, I see what happened."
"863720","864680"," They took two or three years. "
"865240","868180"," The market starts to roll over trade sideways."
"869080","876280"," And then eventually we actually caught up to levels seen in 2000 2008, but the price is actually"
"876280","876900"," higher."
"881520","882460"," Believe that or not. "
"882740","884860"," Well, you don't have to believe it, but I'm telling you right now."
"884920","886720"," So let me just check on spy real quick."
"889050","895190"," I'm currently looking at right here. "
"895190","897570"," The first level of spy."
"899170","900190"," 397 29."
"900530","901010"," It's right here. "
"901290","903450"," A little bit lower 397 29."
"905370","906570"," Right here."
"909500","910640"," I apologize. "
"910960","911720"," I was looking at it."
"911720","912640"," I said it came up, but."
"913460","918340"," Like right still lower on spy. "
"918600","918740"," Yes."
"919680","920180"," Twenty nine."
"920400","921940"," Say it was twenty five. "
"926670","927650"," Right there."
"931680","933260"," Three ninety four eighty four."
"938970","940810"," Right there's the next one right here. "
"944120","949520"," And so these are some pretty serious, pretty serious by areas down here here and here."
"953780","960400"," So long as they spend time down here, the longer the more time we spend in the market, the more"
"960400","966140"," time there is for them to come up underneath like a shark underneath the market and begin to"
"966140","966740"," support it."
"966740","973980"," And even if we break this stuff here, right, the damage price wise isn't as bad as it could have"
"973980","974820"," once been. "
"975480","982300"," So if we crash back in January of two thousand and twenty two and it blasted through these levels"
"982300","987220"," here, it would have been like crash in twenty twenty, which we didn't do."
"987720","991680"," So again, that's the point that I'm trying to make you now on the daily here."
"994370","996950"," We know how to trade this market, right?"
"997070","999210"," If you're a bull at least or a bear. "
"1000430","1002350"," Let's start with the bit with the bulls and the bears."
"1002910","1005850"," Now you'll get a white paper at some point from us."
"1006550","1008790"," But what you can see right here is a bearish crossover. "
"1009390","1009470"," Okay."
"1009570","1010510"," I want you to remember these things."
"1010650","1011870"," We talk about these all the time. "
"1012710","1016670"," But I guess we have new people joining the stream often or don't spend a lot of time in stream"
"1016670","1019670"," with us on a one minute chart when you see this red line crossover."
"1020310","1024290"," And you see a white line cross over here."
"1024849","1026970"," This is a bearish crossover here. "
"1027130","1027270"," Okay."
"1028250","1029750"," We're heading on the down like this."
"1029930","1035010"," You'll see the setup come up and they tee off it right here. "
"1035550","1037230"," T off it right here as well."
"1038089","1040030"," And what we're looking for is two things."
"1040230","1042230"," We're looking for some kind of support. "
"1043950","1045410"," Previous lows, right?"
"1046130","1048130"," We're looking for previous opening prices."
"1048230","1050450"," That's right here actually right here just so you can see it."
"1051250","1053030"," This is the previous open right here. "
"1055870","1060790"," And you're looking for while we're in this bearish downtrend, we're looking for for two things."
"1061010","1064410"," We're looking for previous H lines, right?"
"1065290","1067410"," And then we're looking for where real support is down here."
"1067410","1069230"," And then we're also looking for. "
"1069750","1071350"," Let me check this in the background here."
"1071470","1074910"," I'm looking for the for the slowing of negative velocity."
"1075810","1080490"," Even if you're in a bear trade right here, you're looking for the slowing is slow is velocity"
"1080490","1083050"," slowing or is it picking back up?"
"1083070","1086630"," And on what time frame is it picking back up or slowing down?"
"1086790","1088350"," So we're at 1118 right now. "
"1088610","1090110"," I don't know if you can see that down here."
"1090570","1092810"," I thought I had this on normally, but I guess I don't."
"1093230","1094550"," Another time showing here, do I?"
"1095230","1096010"," Are we done here?"
"1096150","1096950"," I get this time showing. "
"1097170","1097370"," Hold on."
"1097430","1097510"," Look."
"1101300","1102060"," Maybe I don't. "
"1102160","1103820"," Right now it's 1118 in the morning."
"1103960","1106360"," I gotta get a time ticker over here for you guys."
"1107220","1108040"," 1118 in the morning. "
"1108200","1112200"," So the bears have 12 minutes here to send this down."
"1112960","1117080"," Now the hourly trend is on the way up, believe it or not."
"1117220","1118280"," I don't know if you believe this. "
"1119660","1121640"," 15 minute is bearish right now."
"1121640","1128900"," And the five minute is not as bullish in the one minute right now is bullish."
"1129420","1135140"," So they've got 15 minutes basically to be more bearish or get this down as far as they can to"
"1135140","1136980"," the 1130 hour right now. "
"1136980","1139240"," The bears have to get this last little push down."
"1139600","1140120"," Try."
"1141480","1147240"," To retest this low down here at 397 if they can that that's their target down below right where"
"1147240","1149940"," this with this with this red yellow line is. "
"1150600","1154340"," And if they can't get down here, the bulls are going to take over."
"1154900","1158740"," Then you're already starting to see this white line turn."
"1159120","1159300"," Okay. "
"1159500","1165260"," So if you're if you're if you're not looking at velocity, you can just look at white and red lines,"
"1165260","1166080"," believe it or not."
"1166320","1170380"," So you see this white line right here and this red line right here with these things start"
"1170380","1179920"," to curl."
"1179920","1185620"," And say to yourself, oh, this this net, this negative downward velocity, price velocity is slowing. "
"1185620","1187820"," If you see it continue down."
"1188720","1194560"," If you see this start curling down like this and you start to see a white line curling down, even"
"1194560","1196180"," if price hasn't gotten there yet."
"1196800","1200540"," You know that the lot the negative velocity hasn't stopped at this point. "
"1200560","1200880"," Okay."
"1201540","1204540"," You'll actually see like you'll see like a bought like a price bottom hit."
"1204540","1206340"," And it'll start doing this nonsense. "
"1207000","1208320"," You will see two things happen."
"1208460","1213480"," You guys, the line come down, or you'll begin to see the line curve sideways."
"1214300","1219880"," And before even price gets there, you'll know that the downward velocity is waning. "
"1220920","1222700"," Okay, and you'll start to see these things roll over."
"1222900","1224180"," So right now, can we buy a dip?"
"1224760","1228340"," No, we don't see the lines curving up now or even sideways at this point."
"1228780","1235500"," We know on the hourly trigger that the bears have one hour, right, to do their bearish thing that"
"1235500","1235920"," they're doing. "
"1236940","1240840"," But we do know that it's ending heading into 11 30 this morning."
"1241580","1244340"," So we're gonna take a moment here and just let this play itself out."
"1244960","1246520"," Now, if you're like, hey, I'm a bullcap. "
"1246700","1247760"," I wanna buy a dip here."
"1248240","1250080"," Or maybe you're like, the market's crashing cap."
"1250480","1251140"," We're crashing through. "
"1251740","1253460"," You can probably say that to yourself as well."
"1254300","1255840"," Now that you think the market's gonna crash here."
"1256640","1258060"," But the truth is, you're just waiting. "
"1258060","1262540"," If you're a bear, if you're a bear you've got still, you've got nine minutes left right here."
"1263280","1268100"," Now, for your bearish trade, then we'll decide the next hour that we come into from 11 30 to 12"
"1268100","1268440"," 30."
"1268840","1274500"," If you're a bull down here looking for a dip to buy, you're gonna be looking for consolidation down"
"1274500","1274820"," here. "
"1275340","1280560"," Okay, and while you're looking for that consolidation, you're gonna be looking for this red line to"
"1280560","1286160"," start to curve, and you're gonna look for a white line here to begin to curve up."
"1286160","1293120"," And this is, so like that bearish crossover above, you're looking for this crossover here in price"
"1293120","1297540"," to trade higher for you to take a long bullish trade."
"1298080","1302120"," So you want price to go over the one minute here, come back over and retest. "
"1302320","1304220"," That is your double bottom right there, right?"
"1304940","1306300"," Retest that low down there."
"1306440","1308420"," Sometimes you get this and sometimes you don't."
"1308760","1310340"," Sometimes we're just off and running. "
"1311160","1315920"," But either way, you're waiting for this to develop so that you can then take a long trade this"
"1315920","1317560"," market higher, right?"
"1317920","1319660"," And so you see this happen here."
"1319940","1323500"," You can't really jump into a long position, long calls at least."
"1324500","1327260"," And if you're a bear here, what are you looking for?"
"1327360","1330020"," You're looking for the market to continue down, right?"
"1330300","1332000"," Like a cap or crash in here, bro. "
"1332220","1332840"," We're definitely crashing."
"1333540","1338000"," The only thing you're looking for is this line to continue down, and you're looking for this line"
"1338000","1345360"," to continue down, and you want price to reject, right?"
"1345560","1350840"," Come up here, reject and continue rejecting all the way down, all the way down."
"1351140","1353740"," And so you find known supports, right?"
"1354400","1355700"," This is what you're looking for. "
"1355820","1361540"," So if you're a bull, you already know you can't take this trade until these lines start switching"
"1361540","1365180"," around and price starts to switch direction, right?"
"1365320","1368360"," So if you're like, hey, I want to buy a dip gap or how do you know how to buy"
"1368360","1370860"," a dip or when do you buy a dip or why are you buying a dip?"
"1371400","1374040"," What tells you that you can buy a dip here cap?"
"1374220","1375460"," I'm explaining it to you right now."
"1376300","1380680"," How you buy a dip, when you buy a dip, how you can see a dip buying opportunity."
"1381700","1386700"," So you can come back into this broadcast later or clip this thing, I think I'm not gonna name"
"1386700","1389020"," names, but someone here clips, clips for me. "
"1389060","1393440"," This is a great clip to clip and just make a separate video that says how do you know how"
"1393440","1393960"," to buy a dip?"
"1394540","1396200"," How do you know how to close a put?"
"1396720","1398700"," How do you know how to close a short?"
"1399180","1401120"," How do you know where a bottom is?"
"1401280","1402920"," That a lot of people just use support levels."
"1403140","1406160"," Like, oh, we got to support here and now you broke a support here."
"1406240","1411940"," That's not actually how you know when to stop selling or how to stay short. "
"1412640","1417920"," You want to be watching for, if you're short, you're watching for slowing of velocity in the"
"1417920","1423800"," downside for the upside, you're watching for how many times it takes to trade the strength."
"1423800","1430180"," You can also check the strength of you, like right now we're selling, so off the one that strength"
"1430180","1431040"," is big, right?"
"1431440","1436480"," If we come back up in price and have to retest the five minute, velocity is slowing to the downside"
"1436480","1437160"," or the upside."
"1437160","1442300"," So you're watching for how many tests, you're watching for price velocity, and you're also watching"
"1442300","1445520"," for the amount of time it takes for us to get there. "
"1445860","1449960"," The less strength that we have, you'll start to see it on the actual charts."
"1450920","1453160"," And you already have your previous known supports down here."
"1453800","1457060"," So if you're a bull right now, let's say you're a bull, let's say you're a bear right now, right?"
"1457680","1459660"," You don't want to, you don't see your short right now. "
"1459960","1464380"," You don't want to see price velocity the downside slow down."
"1465700","1469320"," You don't want to see this white line start curving sideways."
"1469700","1471620"," You don't want to see this red line starting to curve sideways. "
"1472280","1475920"," The more that you see that, the more that you know that the trade is over."
"1477140","1480540"," Okay, so right now, let me ask you a question out there if you're watching this broadcast."
"1481160","1483200"," Do you think this is over, right?"
"1483320","1484480"," Do you think this trade is over?"
"1484940","1485880"," We're going to find out. "
"1486320","1489920"," You can see the waning of the red line above, see the spacing here."
"1490940","1493980"," See how we start to see some spacing, larger spacing here."
"1495680","1497440"," Right, see how tight it was down here?"
"1498040","1498640"," We're up here at least. "
"1499960","1502480"," And you're seeing the velocity begin to slow here."
"1502780","1505660"," And you're going to see the newest test on the downside."
"1506120","1511120"," So you have a nice test here, trade it right off it, got underneath, got underneath here, and we're"
"1511120","1513940"," going to retest this one minute right here. "
"1514360","1518560"," And we're going to find out if this trade is over or not for the bears."
"1523700","1525460"," So like, okay, Cap, we buying a dip here."
"1525660","1529800"," Now, this is the last part of buying a dip. "
"1530300","1531700"," You can buy a dip down here."
"1531760","1533800"," You might get this right every now and again."
"1533900","1535360"," You might want to put some risk on. "
"1535740","1537720"," You're like, hey, Cap, I think this is bottom."
"1538260","1539740"," This is the deepest it's going to go, Cap."
"1539740","1541580"," So you're like, okay, I'm going to buy this dip here. "
"1541660","1543840"," You're like, I'm going to buy a dip, okay?"
"1544080","1548640"," So you buy here, whatever you want to buy, care if it's a day trade or nothing, right?"
"1549480","1551860"," Now, this is very dangerous buying a dip."
"1552000","1553760"," I'll be telling you the truth."
"1554320","1555460"," I don't think we're done here. "
"1556820","1560280"," But if you did, if you're like, I'm buying this, Cap, I'm going to buy this."
"1560460","1565400"," This is when you hear people say on the internet, you take tight stops, right?"
"1565580","1567400"," So you make super tight stops in here."
"1568580","1569680"," A lot of saying here. "
"1573390","1576510"," Someone's like, yeah, I'm buying a dip here, but I'm going to put some tight stops on."
"1576930","1580090"," Sometimes you let people say, well, we know where your stops are, we're going to do a liquidation"
"1580090","1583130"," break and come back up and head higher and whatever, right?"
"1583630","1584990"," So you have to think about that in your mind."
"1584990","1586190"," I'm going to buy here. "
"1586390","1587690"," This is my tight stops are."
"1589130","1590870"," And how far are you trying to trade this?"
"1591410","1593650"," You literally can only trade this to right here."
"1593730","1594970"," So it's super dangerous, right?"
"1595570","1598490"," There's no real, you're not going to, it's not a high probability win rate for you. "
"1598810","1602690"," So the best thing for you to do is to wait until you get some confirmation."
"1603290","1606950"," So your buys should be up here and you should wait for price to reverse."
"1609210","1610850"," Right, very dangerous down there. "
"1611110","1616510"," You want to wait for price to reverse and trade and tag above and hold, right?"
"1616750","1623910"," If you trade above and hold this, you can then put a buy and a stop lower up here."
"1624030","1631210"," As long as you defend that white line, you can then at least take the trade from here to here."
"1631850","1633510"," And you like, hey, I can make some money right here. "
"1634050","1638270"," And you can say to yourself, I know for a fact that we're either going to bounce off here and"
"1638270","1644890"," retest that one minute where we're going to break through and retest the five minute to go higher."
"1645190","1647710"," And that's your next entry for a buy over here."
"1648330","1649070"," Does that make sense?"
"1649850","1651770"," So this is slightly more safer, right?"
"1652190","1652870"," Take that trade. "
"1653250","1657930"," The safest trade for you though, as a bull, is to wait for this red line to come down, wait"
"1657930","1663990"," for that white line to come down, then wait for price to begin to head higher, test the white, test"
"1663990","1667790"," the red, and then the white line to actually catch back up to you."
"1668270","1670330"," And this is actually the safest trade right here."
"1670790","1672530"," This is the one where the money shot is. "
"1672730","1675590"," This is the one where it has a higher probability of paying for you."
"1676430","1679430"," So everything else down here from the start, right?"
"1679570","1680810"," So you got buy stops down here."
"1682370","1684210"," Remember, I was like, yeah, you buy this. "
"1684210","1688310"," This is the riskiest one for you, right?"
"1688510","1691350"," You can already see it's starting to come down and wanting to stop you out."
"1691810","1696210"," So if you have like four trades as a bull buying a dip, you have the least likely to the"
"1696210","1697990"," most likely of being successful."
"1699250","1700110"," Does that make sense?"
"1700410","1705490"," If you're waiting for a trend reversal, another one I like to do is what I talked to you guys"
"1705490","1711370"," on stream about this sometimes is I'll switch the timeframe from a one minute to a five minute and"
"1711370","1712590"," sometimes even an hourly. "
"1713090","1714270"," Sometimes a four hourly."
"1714570","1717010"," So let's look at the five minute on this."
"1717670","1719590"," We're gonna switch over to a five minute real quick. "
"1720410","1721250"," And look at that."
"1721430","1722410"," This is bearish, right?"
"1722590","1725050"," Look at that huge five minute bearish cross above here."
"1725710","1727610"," You watch that roll above here. "
"1727970","1730730"," And this is where the trigger is for you to take the short, right?"
"1731370","1732330"," Right in here."
"1733010","1738490"," You can see the short down below and even on a five minute chart right here, let me click this."
"1739510","1743610"," Look at how much work needs to happen for the bulls to be back in charge. "
"1744470","1748030"," So just changing a timeframe here, I think tighter."
"1750070","1757010"," Look at the work that needs to actually take place for a bull to feel safer in their trade."
"1758190","1763370"," So just in a five minute chart, just look at the work that needs to be done for a bull"
"1763370","1765590"," to actually feel more confident down here. "
"1765750","1767910"," They need price to come up on just a five minute."
"1767910","1773670"," This is like half the day to go higher right here to even begin to start getting bullish again"
"1774170","1775350"," after this selling off."
"1775430","1776130"," Does that make sense?"
"1776930","1782770"," So you get some time here for bulls that bulls need some time to even begin to start to get"
"1782770","1783530"," bullish again. "
"1784430","1785990"," And we'll look at a one hour too."
"1786530","1787930"," So let's look at trend for the day."
"1789610","1792550"," So just look at, let's look at trend for the day. "
"1793850","1797450"," We know that as long as we stay under the hourly, we're bearish, right?"
"1798370","1801290"," But hold on here, put that back here, right?"
"1801510","1807350"," Teed off above here, teed off above here, teeing off again down here."
"1807590","1814830"," Bear is trying to tell you, nope, the trend is down, trend is down, and we want to break through"
"1814830","1817170"," these levels down below no matter what it takes."
"1817650","1821590"," And I told you yesterday, you ain't getting not, I told you on Sunday, I was like, unless you break"
"1821590","1826730"," through this 396, 397, that this is bottom. "
"1827210","1828750"," This is a very strong bottom."
"1829510","1834730"," And I told you yesterday, the only thing that, this is in the close yesterday, I said to the only"
"1834730","1837750"," thing that bears have going for them is time."
"1838250","1850790"," So bears need time down below here for velocity and the daily, and on the hourly, this"
"1850790","1851570"," is a yellow, right?"
"1852650","1857130"," But they need that they needed yesterday time, days down here. "
"1857130","1864230"," More days they have down here, the more time they have for velocity to come down and try to break"
"1864230","1868650"," and help them through these levels, because otherwise they're not getting through this."
"1868830","1874610"," There's no way for a bear to get through this without velocity on their side."
"1874790","1879190"," They need hourly, they need daily velocity down on their side to break these levels, because it's"
"1879190","1881010"," not gonna happen, I promise you that. "
"1881370","1887830"," So they need time down here for negative velocity to catch back up to break through these levels."
"1888010","1888850"," And they're gonna try their best."
"1889090","1890250"," That's what they're gonna try to do. "
"1890890","1895170"," That's what a sell side wants to do, that's what a crash person wants."
"1895790","1902370"," They wanna slam it, slam it, slam it, slam it, wait for velocity to catch up, break underneath,"
"1903510","1903650"," right?"
"1904530","1908950"," And hold and change this to a support to a resistance."
"1909810","1914870"," They can try anything sneaky they want down here and after hours or in pre-market, any kind of"
"1914870","1916510"," bullshit like that, but it's not gonna hold. "
"1916950","1919410"," That won't hold in a liquid market down here."
"1919670","1920650"," It's not gonna, it never will."
"1921190","1925490"," Any kind of scam runs they try to do in the after hours, not gonna happen. "
"1925670","1930950"," So the best chance that they have the sell side has is in a liquid market to try to allow"
"1930950","1932390"," this stuff to catch up."
"1932810","1940700"," So, hold on here, damn it."
"1949110","1954250"," I'm gonna try to bring this up for you so you can see this velocity that they're hoping for. "
"1956800","1958540"," And I wanna show it to you right here."
"1960200","1963600"," So this is the velocity that they're waiting for to catch up to them."
"1963740","1965000"," You see this red line right here?"
"1965500","1977170"," They want this red line, they want this"
"1977170","1978870"," red line to catch up to them. "
"1978950","1982030"," They want this green line to come down, which it hasn't yet."
"1982710","1987090"," This is the negative, or this is the hourly right here."
"1987190","1997200"," They want this hourly and this daily to come down and help the one minute, the five minute, the"
"1997200","1997580"," hourly. "
"1998380","2000300"," And they're actually waiting for one more over here."
"2001180","2003160"," They want this one to come down and help them out."
"2003240","2004480"," This is the daily right here. "
"2004900","2006020"," See this daily right here?"
"2006100","2007600"," They want this to come down and help them out."
"2008080","2014020"," So they get a nice cluster down here of one, five hourly and daily to help push through."
"2014320","2017740"," So the idea here would be, well, there are some problems right now. "
"2020310","2022470"," They wanna see this come down just like this."
"2029520","2031900"," They wanna see this come down just like this."
"2031960","2041140"," I think I posted this to you yesterday and they wanna see this one come down just like this and"
"2041140","2045800"," they wanna see this one come down just like this. "
"2046300","2052300"," And this is the only way that the bears can get to break these levels right here."
"2052840","2053920"," See these levels right here?"
"2054380","2058639"," This would be priced right here and they need that to help them break through these levels."
"2058639","2060600"," These are some serious levels down here. "
"2061639","2064239"," This is what supports the entire market."
"2064400","2066260"," This is what supports the entire stock market."
"2066679","2070159"," There's some lower levels down there like 331, 370, stuff like that. "
"2070340","2072600"," But truthfully, this is what they're waiting for."
"2072699","2073440"," Do they get this?"
"2074199","2077239"," No, they don't get this until this one comes down."
"2077620","2078400"," They ain't getting it. "
"2079120","2083260"," And they ain't getting it until that one comes down and they ain't getting it until that one comes"
"2083260","2083560"," down."
"2083699","2087400"," It's not good enough that this one minute here is down here by itself."
"2087400","2093560"," If anything, you're gonna see a face ripper down here at this moment right where we are. "
"2093699","2098720"," You should see a bottom coming into play right where we are right now."
"2099380","2101320"," So this is what we're looking for here, right?"
"2101500","2102180"," I'm gonna show you this."
"2102780","2104120"," Now we're in negative velocity, right?"
"2104480","2105340"," Everything looks horrible here. "
"2105940","2110360"," And you've got a price target above of 415 on the one hour chart."
"2110740","2112100"," 415 on the one hour chart."
"2113200","2114360"," We've got a five minute. "
"2115380","2117100"," We've got 400 sitting up here."
"2117160","2118480"," This is all lining right now."
"2119160","2120100"," Let's take a look. "
"2122270","2123010"," Hold on here."
"2123470","2124110"," Give me a second here."
"2125090","2126370"," So can we buy a dip?"
"2127210","2130010"," Where would Captain Jim James try to put a dip at?"
"2130350","2132930"," A dip, let me move some of this stuff here. "
"2133730","2134270"," Hold on here."
"2137730","2138390"," Just a second."
"2140090","2142190"," So where's my target above, right?"
"2142490","2143690"," My target above is 400. "
"2144070","2153930"," I know that right in here somewhere, my"
"2153930","2155130"," first PT right there."
"2155350","2156510"," You see this right here?"
"2156590","2157830"," They want to get underneath this pivot."
"2158530","2162290"," This is my first PT right here, my second PT right there. "
"2162890","2164050"," So I got a PT right here."
"2166700","2169540"," That's PT2, price target two, right there."
"2170560","2171140"," About 400. "
"2172700","2178330"," My first one is gonna be this resistance right here."
"2179710","2182470"," This is all the support, but that's now turning it off."
"2182470","2183490"," Or the trying to turn to resistance. "
"2184370","2188610"," We tagged this H line down below so that we take that one out of the market, right?"
"2191290","2192450"," My buys and my stops."
"2195380","2196960"," Not a bad plan from here, right?"
"2205380","2206900"," Not a bad plan from here, right?"
"2207520","2213880"," To buy a long call here and try to look for 400 as my price target above."
"2217490","2226010"," So my options chain, I'm looking at February 23rd, options expiring today, zero dates, right?"
"2226010","2228010"," We've got 402 C's. "
"2228430","2232010"," They've got 200,000 contracts on them."
"2232050","2233770"," They've torched them down to 10 cents."
"2234870","2236450"," Torched them, right?"
"2236550","2238590"," They're not worth 10 cents at this point, right?"
"2238790","2240130"," Remember how much those were worth yesterday?"
"2240790","2245650"," Remember how much those were worth on the high price of 40210 this morning, right?"
"2245790","2248450"," We tagged that 40210 this morning. "
"2248450","2257370"," And now I'm looking at, yeah, 398s, 399s, 398s for $1.12, another $1.09. And I'm gonna watch this"
"2257370","2258490"," part of the option chain."
"2259050","2261450"," I've got my eyes on 398s right now."
"2261730","2265490"," Another $1.06 and they're getting burned down, right?"
"2265970","2268690"," So I wanna see, hey, what's the price fluctuations down here?"
"2269250","2270990"," As we're down here, I'm gonna watch that strike. "
"2272570","2274530"," Okay, that's the strike I'm watching."
"2274790","2276750"," Now if we trade lower, let's see, we blast down here."
"2277590","2278730"," We start grinding down here. "
"2279030","2284190"," I might switch and start looking at 408s, but I've got my eyes on one strike right now, 409."
"2285470","2288570"," I know that, three, oh, sorry, 398, excuse me."
"2291010","2295830"," 397s I'm looking at, those are a $1.60. So in my mind, I'm like, oh, okay. "
"2296510","2298830"," So if I can get 397s for a buck, that's their cheap."
"2299650","2303550"," If I look at 398s, I can get those for 60, 70 cents, that's their cheap."
"2304730","2306470"," So I'm gonna watch that second strike. "
"2306730","2309610"," Now I'm watching 398s, 397s."
"2309610","2311210"," So I gotta look cock-eyed here to the side."
"2312390","2316190"," So I'm watching these two strikes down here for a reversal. "
"2317850","2322050"," I've got my PT set up above, PT one, PT two."
"2322750","2327810"," Another thing that I talk to you guys about frequently is why I talk to you guys about directional"
"2327810","2330390"," trades on zero dates, right, directional."
"2331350","2334330"," Your trades are only as good for the direction that you run them in. "
"2335250","2338490"," You can't, I can't, I'm not gonna buy a zero date at any time."
"2338490","2343510"," I don't know if you guys watch the price action on a zero date, they go to zero."
"2344350","2346670"," They're only good for the direction that you're in. "
"2347350","2351870"," So you're a zero date that you're in, not always, sometimes they'll blast off and they'll be like 4 "
"2351870","2353830",",000% of the day for a trend day."
"2355030","2358210"," But most times they're worth the price for the direction."
"2358830","2365010"," They actually lose their value, gain value, lose their value, and as time passes, they go to a big"
"2365010","2367790"," fat zero by end of day, right?"
"2367790","2374830"," So you're constantly fighting theta and you're constantly fighting directional loss, right?"
"2375090","2381450"," You're fighting Vega, you're fighting all kinds of forces against you making money on these trades. "
"2382010","2384250"," You're fighting dealers in this, right?"
"2385110","2388210"," So you see in the waning right now, you know we have support down here."
"2389510","2394690"," Here's your stops, here's your buys, and you're gonna start to think about taking along here,"
"2394690","2395210"," right?"
"2395210","2397470"," As we slow, philosophy begins to slow down."
"2399560","2406080"," So the moment I buy down here, I'll let you know, like I always do, what I buy at the"
"2406080","2408700"," price that I buy at and then where we're gonna take this to. "
"2409300","2414940"," So my PT above 39888 and then again at 400, right above here."
"2417590","2419570"," I'm watching the clock right now as well."
"2421650","2422990"," Hang tight one second here. "
"2423690","2427270"," Let me turn the stream, the new squawk on for you."
"2441990","2444310"," You guys must be so bearish out there too, I bet."
"2444590","2446210"," But you guys are all super bearish out there. "
"2451400","2452720"," Hold on one second here."
"2462320","2469700"," So 398 is now down to 82 cents, to 397's $1.30. They were $1.60 a few minutes ago."
"2470400","2472440"," The 398's were a dollar a few minutes ago. "
"2473980","2476100"," 402's are now worth five cents."
"2476800","2479680"," So they've torched anyone, anything in those calls, right?"
"2480180","2480700"," They're now worthless."
"2481080","2482140"," This is like the put side too. "
"2482660","2485740"," You guys will hear me in the stream saying the puts are getting cheap finally."
"2485920","2487880"," You might wanna sell your calls, right?"
"2488460","2492580"," You guys hear me in the stream all the time, like sell your calls because these puts, there's a"
"2492580","2494180"," high concentration of puts in the market."
"2494600","2496980"," They went from like three bucks down to two cents. "
"2497960","2499320"," And those calls haven't come off."
"2500080","2504960"," Those are some puts in the market, but they're likely gonna close to zero."
"2505580","2510080"," But the closer they get to that zero number, we tend to get bounces or cells in the market"
"2510080","2513120"," depending on what side these algos are on. "
"2514400","2516780"," Right down here, I'm looking to buy a dip down here."
"2536110","2539090"," Just so you guys can see, I wanna show you what I'm trying, what I'm looking at here."
"2541240","2543360"," Right here, I'm trying to buy this dip right here. "
"2546820","2548380"," Right down here, you see that?"
"2550560","2551740"," That's 397 14."
"2556760","2559620"," So 397 14, right here, right where you are right now."
"2563190","2567890"," Germany's Chancellor Scholtz says, I have told China's representatives that sending Russia weapons"
"2567890","2569030"," cannot be accepted. "
"2587520","2588660"," All right guys, we'll see."
"2591910","2598450"," Now I'm looking at 397s, those are down to $1.10. So I'm gonna switch my buy over to 397s."
"2598550","2600590"," I haven't bought anything, but I got those set up. "
"2600690","2602290"," So now I'm gonna set up 397."
"2602550","2605130"," They were $1.60 just a few moments ago."
"2605690","2625580"," Now they're $1.12, $1 "
"2625580","2632420",".14, $1.15, I'm in for $1.15 on 397c. "
"2652910","2653470"," Right there."
"2654290","2656650"," $1.15, 397c."
"2656890","2658410"," I'm gonna put my stops under here. "
"2662890","2663870"," These are for today."
"2664770","2666590"," How long is this trade good for?"
"2667750","2672850"," They're gonna try to sell this one minute down, right above here, okay, 397 88."
"2674350","2675970"," I've got my stops down here. "
"2677170","2678910"," You might have your stops right here."
"2679070","2680390"," You might have your stops down here."
"2680410","2681390"," I don't know where you have your stops. "
"2682430","2683750"," I don't know if you're paper trading."
"2684250","2688570"," I don't know if you're just writing this down for yourself so you can find out, is this good, bad,"
"2688830","2691970"," whatever, it's gonna make money and I'm gonna lose all my money, all that stuff."
"2692130","2692990"," You decide for yourself. "
"2694150","2695250"," Not financial advice."
"2695670","2696670"," Don't ever trade what I trade."
"2698970","2709070"," Now trade $1.23 on 397c, $1 "
"2709070","2731950",".26 on 397c, $1 "
"2731950","2739630",".20, $1.21. What don't I want to see here?"
"2739770","2741830"," If you're long here, right, what don't you wanna see?"
"2743090","2745070"," You don't wanna see a breakdown here, right?"
"2745910","2748390"," You wanna see a break and hold of any kind, right?"
"2749010","2753170"," You don't wanna see, you can see like this, like this quick rip down below, but you don't wanna see"
"2753170","2755050"," this kind of nonsense, right?"
"2755770","2756590"," You don't wanna see any of that. "
"2756670","2757790"," You start to see this kind of nonsense."
"2758810","2761510"," You wanna get out with your stops before, right?"
"2767920","2773380"," $1.29, 397c, $1.30, 397c."
"2791840","2794920"," You can also put limit stops on these if you like. "
"2795440","2797100"," You guys know what a limit stop is?"
"2798140","2800560"," You can say, yeah, about $1.15, I don't wanna give them up."
"2800820","2802700"," I'm just gonna put $1.15 on them."
"2804020","2805440"," I didn't time it right. "
"2810280","2813900"," So I bought for $1.15, it's going in my direction, right?"
"2814100","2815380"," It picked my direction correctly."
"2816960","2819620"," So you're like, ah, it doesn't go automatically in my way."
"2820000","2825680"," If we don't start going up here, I just put a stop at $1.15, I haven't lost a single"
"2826260","2826800"," fucking penny. "
"2828240","2829640"," Does that make sense to you?"
"2832440","2838060"," You've got order types, limits, markets, stop market, stop limit, right?"
"2838220","2842700"," So stop limit down below, type that in."
"2843920","2846880"," I can just put a stop limit at $1.15, right here."
"2857970","2863910"," So I can't lose a penny unless we were to have some kind of a crash, maybe. "
"2864170","2864810"," I guess that would."
"2868470","2871890"," I guess that would, you know, I didn't get a fill or something."
"2872090","2875990"," Yesterday and the day before I had some problems getting fills while selling. "
"2877050","2884710"," Now, trading a $1.32, I'm up 10%, I think, 10, 15% somewhere in there."
"2888170","2890130"," I'm gonna have a sip of coffee here with you."
"2898200","2900540"," I don't wanna see us reject over here, do I?"
"2906330","2908510"," There's a bear wants to hold right here, right?"
"2909070","2910550"," Bears like, nah, nah, nah, captain. "
"2911270","2912630"," We're crashing today, bro."
"2913330","2914510"," We're pissed off, bro."
"2914770","2917190"," If we're gonna go up higher, bro, I want you to get out of my shorts, bro. "
"2917890","2918570"," Even to print, bro."
"2923010","2924790"," Right, so they raised my stops up."
"2925070","2926510"," Some of you guys don't wanna give any money back. "
"2926670","2929450"," You're like, well, shit, about $1.15 with your cap."
"2930470","2931530"," I don't wanna give it up."
"2931950","2937110"," So maybe you make your stops $1.20, you've guaranteed five cents. "
"2937310","2938750"," You just made five cents, you lose a penny."
"2959870","2963330"," Sorry, I'm watching my calls right here, because I'm gonna get stopped out here."
"2969140","2971120"," So I just got stopped out just now. "
"2972800","2974760"," So I just got stopped out right here."
"2974980","2977020"," So I'm flat right now, I'm the nothing."
"2979600","2981580"," Right, so let's say I'm like, ah, you know what?"
"2982280","2984500"," So this is gone now, right?"
"2985360","2986780"," This is gone now, right?"
"2986920","2990580"," So now I'm like, ah, so I picked this direction or zest going up right here. "
"2992080","2994260"," I haven't lost a single penny here."
"2995620","2998540"," I'm still believing in my thesis, believe it or not, down here."
"2998860","3002160"," Now, normally I wouldn't have had a stop there, but we're gonna do this shit together. "
"3003140","3005060"," So you don't lose your asses in this market."
"3024030","3027090"," So I'm still looking at these 397s, right?"
"3027310","3031790"," Another $1.15 right now, I got stopped out, but I want this trade badly."
"3033410","3035810"," I want this trade, I wanna buy these down here. "
"3036450","3041210"," So I'm gonna watch them wait right here and see if I can get into this trade to go higher"
"3041210","3041530"," here."
"3042270","3043850"," I wanna see momentum slow."
"3044230","3045710"," I don't wanna see us trade under here. "
"3046430","3047630"," We start trading under here."
"3047710","3051750"," They try to treat this like it's a resistance now and not a support."
"3052010","3053290"," Then I can't buy here, right?"
"3053970","3055530"," I'm gonna have to wait until I'm here. "
"3059660","3062200"," I'm gonna have to wait until this next level below, right?"
"3062380","3064760"," 395, I think the next one is, let me take a look at it."
"3068860","3071820"," 394, 77, right here is the next level down below."
"3073360","3077220"," So if we do break this level, this is the next level that I'm looking for. "
"3077360","3078160"," It's make a buy, right?"
"3078360","3082500"," So if I can't make this buy here, I'll put this right down here and look for the next place"
"3082500","3084000"," to buy if we break through."
"3088530","3089970"," I'm still trying to buy here, though."
"3090070","3091570"," I'm not trying to fucking buy way down here. "
"3100620","3102520"," 397c is now 99 cents."
"3103280","3107080"," So if I didn't have a buy stop in, I would be down 14 cents right now, right?"
"3107560","3108060"," Hold on here."
"3108320","3110500"," Goddamn it, I should have bought that dollar. "

"3128930","3131750"," It was so fast, I didn't even get to catch it."
"3132570","3136630"," It was 99 cents for like a minute, for like a minute, not me not to be like a second,"

"4009380","4011160"," yeah, you probably shouldn't use Wojack."
"4011580","4013220"," And I was like, you know what, the guy made a good point. "
"4013920","4016760"," I was like, I should take the time to make my own Wojack."
"4017480","4018700"," So I had some time."
"4019180","4024440"," I had the internet down and I had the electricity was off. "
"4025120","4027620"," What's crazy too is I had two power surges."
"4028700","4030860"," I'm doing construction on this house."
"4031080","4035000"," I had a bank of outlets without a plate cover on them. "
"4035600","4041980"," And I was able to see both power surges through the plate cover not being on."
"4042640","4045520"," I was able to see the power surges."
"4045520","4051280"," Everything that I've got is on power strips or surge protectors, any kind of electronics. "
"4054120","4061080"," But I had time to do some, I had time my hands to do some graphic design."

"4076220","4076800"," Hold on here."
"4076880","4077980"," I'm gonna try to bring this up on the back. "
"4078160","4079140"," I'm gonna get my eyes on the screen."
"4080280","4081940"," Cause they're gonna try to sell this shit here."
"4082280","4083480"," And I don't want them to sell me down. "
"4085440","4086080"," Hold on here."
"4089980","4094900"," And I gotta make sure this merchandise is worth buying and worth having."
"4095140","4096479"," Like you wanna go to the beach with it. "
"4096640","4099680"," You wanna sit in your backyard and cry in your bear with it."
"4100279","4101399"," And so I'm like, you know what I'm gonna do?"
"4101500","4101939"," I'm gonna do some work."
"4103660","4104899"," So I ended up doing some work. "
"4104899","4108319"," And I got one new item up."
"4108460","4110580"," I took the bear-coosie down."
"4112439","4114399"," And I'm watching this shit. "
"4114560","4115920"," I'm like, get up there, you motherfucker."
"4121010","4122770"," Make stark, stark grind."
"4123069","4125870"," And see that one minute turning sideways here?"
"4126649","4128250"," See that rolling one minute right there?"
"4130090","4131310"," I'm gonna get up there. "
"4133819","4135319"," Show me that squeeze, baby."
"4136540","4137640"," Show me that squeeze."
"4142990","4144310"," Get up there a little bit. "
"4144410","4145189"," Don't fucking reverse."
"4145529","4146689"," I don't wanna see this do I?"
"4146990","4148630"," This is what I don't wanna see, right?"
"4149450","4151590"," I don't wanna see that selling down right there, right?"
"4152189","4153870"," That bloodbath down right here."
"4154870","4156750"," I wanna see that grind up here. "
"4157450","4159350"," That was very dangerous place that I'm in right now."
"4163870","4164950"," Very dangerous trade."
"4177080","4178340"," I'm gonna try to sell off this. "
"4178640","4180140"," They wanna tee it off and go lower."
"4181040","4182660"," This is what a bear wants right here."
"4183479","4184260"," Hold on here. "
"4187560","4188620"," Not, dang it."
"4189399","4190660"," Bears don't wanna tee right off."
"4190700","4193360"," The bear's trying to tee right off right here and get this down. "
"4197980","4199480"," You got some stops right in here."
"4199620","4201200"," You know where they're gonna try to stop me out, right?"
"4218620","4222180"," So I made a post on Fintuit, like a week or two ago."
"4222660","4227640"," So according to a trade sources, rushing your house through the prices for March loadings rise to"
"4227640","4229460"," all $60 per barrel price cap. "
"4230560","4234520"," So I made a post and I said with Wojack."
"4235480","4242200"," And about two weeks ago, I made this post and I was like waiting for the last leg down since"
"4242200","4243380"," June, 2022."
"4244100","4246440"," I think we've all been waiting for that last leg down, right?"
"4246600","4247960"," When do we get the last leg down?"
"4248340","4249300"," How long does it take?"
"4249680","4250740"," Does it take a year?"
"4251040","4251800"," Does it take six months?"
"4252180","4255900"," Cause that was, you know, June or May, June of 2022. "
"4257220","4259380"," And now we're in February, right?"
"4259600","4260480"," We're in the end of February."
"4260940","4263120"," This is actually the weakest part of the spring, right?"
"4263620","4265980"," Last week of February is pretty much the weakest part of the spring."
"4269220","4275020"," And you're like, are we gonna get that last leg down in the first quarter of 2023?"
"4275340","4280160"," We're gonna have to wait until fall, winter of 2023 to get the last leg down. "
"4280380","4281340"," When do we finally get it?"
"4282180","4285160"," There's bulls that want that last leg down so they can buy in safety."
"4286160","4289880"," Bears have been waiting for it for seven months, right?"
"4290040","4291000"," Eight months, something like that."
"4291560","4294820"," June, July, August, February, October, that seven, eight, nine months. "
"4295500","4300100"," Bear hasn't seen the second leg down that they're looking for, right?"
"4300280","4302160"," They want, bulls can't buy in safety."
"4303100","4306060"," The most safety that they can have with a lot of the last leg down."
"4306220","4308520"," Probably gonna get stopped out here in just a second. "
"4309420","4312640"," Getting close, crispy, and smell it."
"4316280","4321360"," So the point being here is that I've made this post on Fintuit and I made it with this Wojak"
"4321360","4326260"," that looks like he's been fucking waiting for the last leg down, for months and months and months"
"4326260","4326600"," and months."
"4327700","4333540"," And so I made a bear koozy with Wojak on one side on the other side of the can says,"
"4335380","4339820"," waiting, I think it says waiting for the last, waiting for the next leg down in the market. "
"4340020","4341360"," So I'm gonna show you a picture of it."
"4341720","4345780"," You tell me if you think that I should put this one up for sale, cause I did some work"
"4345780","4346720"," on one last night."
"4347820","4349400"," We'll put that up in just a minute here for you. "
"4355810","4357670"," Oh man, they're trying to sell this down so bad."
"4358210","4360070"," I'm about to fucking hit the sale button, I'm close."
"4361290","4362710"," I am real close here. "
"4366870","4367590"," Real close."
"4393080","4395300"," Can we get above this one minute at any point here?"
"4396380","4399560"," If we get above here at any point, I'll show you the picture."
"4400660","4404980"," So you can see if you like it or not. "
"4405880","4406820"," And if you like it, I'll leave it up."
"4406960","4409260"," If you don't think I need to do more work on it, I'll do more work."
"4436120","4439360"," I had some people in Stream yesterday say they knew about graphic design. "
"4439360","4444740"," I think Jason Hendrix, Ergo, and a few other people mentioned graphic design."
"4445300","4447880"," I don't know if that, do I have those names right?"
"4448040","4449360"," I think I do, but I'm not positive."
"4450980","4452700"," Come on baby, get above that one minute. "
"4453580","4456740"," Get on up there, fight your way back."
"4459080","4459980"," Come on now."
"4462440","4465760"," Now trade 95 cents, only down two pennies. "
"4467260","4468920"," 96 cents right now."
"4470000","4471640"," Come on now, get on up there."
"4478700","4480720"," Do not fucking sell over that. "
"4484430","4486250"," Get on top of that one minute."
"4487410","4492710"," Now trade 98 cents, $1 on 397 Cs."
"4494050","4504060"," Now if we can hold a retest here, if we can hold a retest here, the"
"4504060","4506460"," next target above is going to be 398, 17. "
"4507180","4511620"," I still have my PT above at 398, 88, and then 400 right up here."
"4516640","4520460"," So right here now I want to see any kind of retest down below."
"4522360","4523540"," I'm going to make that green. "
"4540480","4544380"," This is nothing now, that was another pivot point, another H line."
"4545820","4548080"," Now trade a $4, $7."
"4548080","4557990"," And I'll show you right now, I'm going to show you, I always hate doing this because"
"4557990","4562150"," I'll fucking reverse this shit and my shit will bleed off, right?"
"4563430","4578520"," So on the, hold on here, I'll mute the, there"
"4578520","4579560"," we go right there. "
"4581360","4584760"," So this is the, this is the can right here."
"4584960","4586800"," The can who's waiting for the next leg down."
"4588980","4590240"," We'll take a look at it real quick. "
"4590260","4590720"," It's kind of cool."
"4591000","4591220"," Hold on."
"4592840","4595220"," So what I did was I made my own Wojack. "
"4596800","4601580"," I made my own Wojack with my face."
"4602020","4605320"," I just cut my hair off and that kind of stuff, slapped it on like a mask."
"4606220","4607600"," And then I did my own work on it. "
"4607780","4610660"," The back of it says waiting for the next leg down."
"4612140","4613940"," There it is sitting on your favorite table."
"4614660","4619960"," There it is sitting in your hand and instead of Wojack, it's just like, it's just a can of Captain"
"4619960","4623140"," Jim James waiting for the lot, a lot next leg down. "
"4625580","4628680"," So that this shouldn't be, this is kind of an original, but it's not original."
"4629200","4631040"," I guess that's like a, I'm still, I'm not an artist."
"4631280","4634240"," So don't fucking think for a minute that I'm an artist. "
"4635520","4636260"," But there it is."
"4636400","4637320"," That's actually me right there."
"4637400","4639020"," I've got my, you see my beard down there and stuff. "
"4640600","4649400"," So I guess it's, I guess it's kind of, kind of not really original art, but it's not quite just"
"4649400","4654940"," taking a meme photo off the meme sites and put it on there."
"4655080","4655860"," So let me know what you think of that."
"4656380","4660980"," If you like that or not, if you think that's acceptable, if you don't think that it is, let me"
"4660980","4662760"," know in the chat, I'll start reading the chat here. "
"4664420","4666480"," So I want to see this, this hold here."
"4666480","4670400"," I don't want to see the one thing I'm not, one thing I'm looking for here is I don't want"
"4670400","4670740"," to see."
"4673640","4676140"," Rejection, not a rejection, but, but no hold here, right?"
"4676240","4679240"," I want to see this price come up, hold this one minute. "
"4680380","4684860"," Then we at least take off up here and try to tag this here."
"4685180","4687100"," Come back down, hit this, hit this again."
"4688140","4691920"," And watch this five minute come down and then come back up here and hit this one right here. "
"4692800","4696820"," Okay, so I got two targets above if it holds."
"4697440","4699380"," So right now I'm looking for one right here."
"4703080","4705220"," I'm going to be looking for, I need some water. "
"4706320","4708940"," And then having another one right in here."
"4710420","4714560"," And we'll see if this holds up because oftentimes you'll see a bull trap in here, right?"
"4715460","4718980"," Get above the one minute and they just huck it right back down on you and we're back off and"
"4718980","4720260"," running some new lows down below."
"4721000","4723000"," And I don't want to, I don't want to see that happen here. "
"4723160","4727760"," So I have to be really careful that we don't, that we don't close or trade under the one minute."
"4728780","4735460"," So maybe watching these bars here and making sure that we don't have like a bar down and then a"
"4735460","4737020"," bar up and then we reverse, right?"
"4737160","4740200"," You'll see one candle like this, right?"
"4740400","4745300"," You'll see one candle come up and it will reject and then we start making our way lower right"
"4745300","4745540"," there."
"4748680","4750060"," I'm going to watch this right here. "
"4750760","4755270"," I want to see this one minute hold."
"4757090","4759310"," Let me read your chat and see what you thought about that picture."
"4765950","4769250"," If I make an intraday P-jug with that graphic, I know I'm going to have to take a piss"
"4769250","4769690"," soon too. "
"4769750","4770410"," I just pounded coffee."
"4771150","4773450"," Like I just slammed a cup of coffee while I was talking to you guys."
"4778240","4780220"," You need stickers of that, ice cold can, hell yeah. "
"4785390","4787830"," I changed it 30% it's a new original right on."
"4792620","4794380"," Mid-journey AI, hold on here."
"4795460","4796340"," Let me write this down. "
"4803600","4805000"," All right, mid-journey AI, I got it."
"4807600","4808600"," We need to smash it."
"4808680","4810620"," I got those smashing and bashing written down. "
"4810860","4812380"," I haven't, I need some help."
"4812600","4816500"," I need to meet someone that can do some of this, or not do, but like can do it faster"
"4816500","4817060"," than I can."
"4817200","4817500"," I suck. "
"4818500","4820340"," I'm not a graphic designer in any way, shape or form."
"4820480","4821040"," I suck at that stuff."
"4822000","4825060"," I suck at the finer details of it and the layering and all that kind of stuff. "
"4828660","4829760"," I'm not good with colors."
"4830140","4831240"," There's a whole bunch of stuff."
"4831340","4832060"," I'm color blind. "
"4840830","4842330"," Yeah, I don't want to see this right here."
"4843990","4846750"," Oh, so I just missed, I wasn't watching the chart."
"4846930","4847570"," I was reading the chat. "
"4850490","4852110"," I don't like seeing this right here."
"4852190","4852690"," This is bad."
"4858810","4859990"," He's fucking bears. "
"4862470","4864030"," I missed that last bar there."
"4864150","4864930"," I wasn't paying attention."
"4866410","4868070"," He's fucking bears man. "
"4876480","4879160"," I'm over here reading the fucking chat instead of watching the bars."
"4891140","4892400"," Let me see here."
"4895270","4896350"," Yeah, so I got the. "
"4903020","4904280"," Read some of your chat here."
"4907350","4911510"," If you know how, if you know what you're doing, hit me up in DMS. If you know what you're"
"4911510","4912430"," doing with design. "
"4913630","4914810"," So I've got some designs."
"4916450","4918730"," But they look, they look really bad."
"4919230","4922270"," And then I wrote down everything that the community wanted to see. "
"4923490","4928130"," And I don't, I don't need like a bunch of Captain Jim James shit."
"4929290","4935390"," I'd really like to have some subtle stuff and stuff that is like not associated with me, but just"
"4935390","4938570"," cool stuff that someone could wear or use."
"4939690","4941310"," That they've always wanted to see made. "
"4941890","4947810"," So it doesn't mean a lot of the stuff that I've got here doesn't even look like the Captain Jim"
"4947810","4948450"," James thing."
"4952940","4954220"," You like the YouTube images."
"4954960","4956040"," I try to keep them pretty trashy. "
"4958160","4959800"," That's intentional, believe it or not."
"4959960","4962720"," The YouTube, the YouTube cover art is intentionally bad."
"4963460","4965300"," You know what Joe Harper made it. "
"4965420","4969120"," You went to Harper said he was like, you should have one of your, so my daughters."
"4970400","4975440"," Take, take these like private art classes and stuff."
"4976120","4976840"," And I was like. "
"4978120","4983780"," Or Joe was like, you should have your daughters make your, your, your artwork every day for you."
"4983780","4986660"," And I, I tend to agree with him."
"4987160","4990980"," I haven't discussed it with him yet, but I would, I would really like to keep it simplistic. "
"4993060","5000630"," Maybe have the kids do the artwork instead of myself doing it."
"5004160","5004920"," Yeah, Jason."
"5005180","5006360"," Joe Joe Joe. "
"5012760","5013200"," Thanks."
"5013380","5014180"," Really appreciate it, man."
"5014860","5017420"," Yeah, I'm like, I'm very basic in this stuff. "
"5017640","5023180"," I'm never going to claim to be when I was a kid, right?"
"5024820","5028280"," So when I was, when I was a child, I was in art classes."
"5029560","5030700"," This is bottom, baby."
"5031220","5031800"," You're on a bottom. "
"5033960","5038180"," My mother pulled me out of a, a, a paid art."
"5039500","5043000"," So I would go to school all day long and then my mom paid for me to go to art"
"5043000","5044200"," classes after school."
"5045100","5049960"," Wasn't like a fourth, fifth grade going every day. "
"5051280","5054180"," And this is a matter of fact, this is right before I took up a soccer."
"5055500","5056760"," And the year before."
"5057780","5059300"," They couldn't take art classes anymore. "
"5059480","5061240"," My mom came to the art class and pulled me out."
"5062920","5068860"," And she lit her up some in the middle of the art class and she like comes into the classroom."
"5069380","5073940"," The Fed has caught up and will have to pause and may not be enough. "
"5074480","5076660"," And he says, there's still a chance for his soft landing."
"5077880","5082040"," She comes into the classroom and she's like, I'm coming to get my son out of this class."
"5082080","5083160"," She's never coming back again. "
"5083640","5085000"," Teachers all disheveled."
"5086480","5087500"," And she's got me."
"5088500","5091300"," She's like holding me like a hand on my shoulder. "
"5092560","5094080"," And I'm like, what's going on?"
"5094160","5095340"," I'm thinking that something bad happened."
"5095460","5096980"," Maybe somebody died in my family or whatever."
"5097340","5099140"," And my father doesn't know this. "
"5099360","5100000"," It's just my mom."
"5101380","5104160"," And she said to me, she said, I'm pulling you out of our class."
"5104160","5105360"," You're never coming to these again. "
"5105360","5106640"," And I said, why?"
"5107540","5108800"," And I was like, I love this stuff."
"5110300","5114660"," And she said, I was thinking about you today."
"5114840","5118880"," And all I could think to myself was that if you continue taking art classes, you would become an"
"5118880","5119100"," artist. "
"5119840","5121580"," You'd be poor for the rest of your life."
"5122900","5125920"," And I'm afraid that you'll be poor being an artist for the rest of your life."
"5126220","5128400"," She's like, don't she goes, don't ask me any questions about this. "
"5129420","5132040"," I'm your mother and I don't want you to do this."
"5132620","5133460"," It stuck with me forever."
"5134820","5136020"," She did that to me. "
"5136140","5136480"," I was devastated."
"5138340","5144520"," That's actually when I took up soccer, like junior high, like middle school junior high soccer."
"5145420","5146260"," And that was acceptable. "
"5147260","5148680"," So I did that instead."
"5152240","5152780"," Thanks, really."
"5165020","5166320"," Yeah, no, I'm still long here, man. "
"5166640","5168040"," I'm still in calls right now."
"5168280","5168920"," I haven't sold nothing."
"5172540","5173380"," I've got calls here. "
"5174240","5175100"," I'm up right now."
"5175300","5176260"," I haven't lost anything today."
"5176680","5177460"," I'm green, baby. "
"5178400","5178680"," I'm green."
"5178680","5181460"," I made a fat fucking made fat fucking money in that open."
"5181460","5184120"," So I'm green for the week right now. "
"5184120","5185220"," So I'm doing quite well."
"5185880","5186800"," I'm very happy."
"5188200","5192180"," I was very, I was down bigly earlier in the week. "
"5192200","5194240"," Now I am in the green."
"5194820","5196220"," Hopefully I can close this week out."
"5197200","5197640"," Green. "
"5210670","5213570"," Oh, really 800 bucks for a shirt."
"5218520","5219740"," What style am I looking for?"
"5220140","5221060"," I don't know."
"5221140","5222100"," You know, do is how about this?"
"5222400","5223680"," What I'll do is I'll type up a."
"5224540","5225660"," If any of you are interested. "
"5227420","5231220"," I don't I'll show you what they I'll show you what they charge and what."
"5231760","5234060"," If you're anyone who contacts me, I'll show you what they charge."
"5234340","5235460"," I don't have high prices. "
"5237400","5239620"," I'm not trying to make money off this stuff."
"5239780","5242520"," So if you want to get paid from it or something."
"5243080","5247860"," We want to catch in on payments for designs or whatever it is. "
"5247860","5251240"," I have no like financial interest in this."
"5251240","5253820"," That's more for the community."
"5254320","5260280"," So if you want it to like say, Hey, give me X amount of dollars per shirt that you sell"
"5260280","5261120"," or something like that. "
"5261700","5262380"," I'm open to that."
"5265920","5267100"," I'll I'll I'll about this."
"5267240","5273180"," I'll type out my concepts or I'll type out the concepts and then I'll show some examples. "
"5274860","5280320"," For a look and if that's something that you wanted to take a someone you guys want to take a"
"5280320","5281400"," shot at out there or something."
"5281400","5283460"," I'm completely open to it."
"5284920","5287200"," We've got people in the background that can. "
"5288320","5290640"," Track the sales and all that stuff and show you sales and."
"5292080","5292580"," Whatever."
"5311330","5312890"," What a mom hero. "
"5314570","5316630"," She was a my mom."
"5316850","5317550"," She's still alive."
"5319110","5321690"," She's a moms are weird, man. "
"5322170","5324230"," I don't know if all moms like that, but my mom."
"5325810","5329870"," Yeah, I got like all kinds of weird stories about her."
"5332180","5335840"," I like I really loved her when I was younger. "
"5336600","5342360"," And then I realized that my my father had my best interests for me the entire time."
"5344480","5346520"," My father taught me to be."
"5350140","5354020"," You know, I guess when I was younger, I didn't like my father at all. "
"5354620","5355880"," He was hard on me."
"5359800","5362760"," My mom really was like the like loved on me."
"5363940","5368780"," When I was young and my father, of course, as I turned into a right when I hit like 12,"
"5368840","5372000"," 13 and started getting testosterone and stuff. "
"5372760","5374480"," My dad started treating me differently, right?"
"5375780","5377120"," And my early teenagers."
"5378360","5379840"," I was a tough was tough."
"5380160","5380820"," It was like test. "
"5381060","5384340"," You know, it was like testosterone and a young guy had a lot of testosterone."
"5384340","5388260"," And I wasn't of course my father's expectations."
"5388600","5390840"," I'll never I'll never meet, right?"
"5393040","5397180"," Sometimes I say I'm grateful that I don't have any sons because I don't know if I would be a"
"5397180","5397680"," good dad. "
"5401080","5405620"," If I would like I don't ever want to like become my dad, but it's weird because I've gotten older."
"5406200","5409920"," I have a lot more respect for him than I ever did when I was a younger man."
"5410520","5416060"," I've called him over the years and said, you know, I appreciate the way that he raised me. "
"5416060","5417940"," I know at the time that I didn't."
"5419420","5423660"," They taught me some valuable lessons that have served me well and my adulthood."
"5433330","5434310"," That's probably right. "
"5435130","5440590"," Yeah, my mom I don't you know, I can't tell now as an adult."
"5441410","5446750"," I wish my mom there was some things that my mom did that I didn't appreciate."
"5450480","5451460"," Once I got older. "
"5452900","5461600"," But I still mean still over more than anything in the entire world, you know, I love her."
"5462000","5463260"," I can't say I don't love my mom."
"5464780","5467680"," But there was, you know, there's two different experiences, right?"
"5467820","5468520"," You get two parents. "
"5469680","5470740"," They treat you differently."
"5471460","5472040"," You know that, right?"
"5472660","5475060"," Especially you have that balanced upbringing, right?"
"5476720","5480080"," But then sometimes the parents fight with each other and how to raise the kids."
"5480080","5487220"," I think that's the part where that kind of frustrated me later in life. "
"5487420","5495060"," Or as I became not not now, but when I was maybe like, like mid mid twenties mid thirties, you"
"5495060","5501160"," start to figure out who you are and start to question things like, who am I?"
"5501380","5502640"," What am I going to become all that kind of stuff?"
"5504120","5505100"," Well, this is good."
"5505440","5506380"," This is good for bulls."
"5506720","5508280"," So bulls are waiting to watch this here. "
"5508900","5510580"," So bulls, you see how this white line."
"5511620","5512960"," Starting to even out here."
"5514400","5515800"," This is constructive from bulls. "
"5519670","5522170"," This box comes right down with the red line right here."
"5524480","5526040"," Bulls want to see time spent."
"5527260","5529740"," This looks like a buyable bottom to me, right?"
"5529860","5531840"," It's starting to turn into a buyable bottom down here. "
"5532800","5537480"," So if you're looking for constructive bullishness, this would be a sign of it right here."
"5539100","5543400"," This box moves with the red line on wherever it is, PT one still above right here."
"5546500","5547420"," I am long calls. "
"5547660","5550600"," I'm in 397 seas for 97 cents."
"5550760","5551760"," Haven't added anything to him."
"5552140","5552740"," Nothing like that. "
"5559800","5560680"," Luma was probably right."
"5560760","5561460"," She probably was right."
"5565410","5566550"," I'm an artist and not poor. "
"5566930","5568010"," Work for video games right on."
"5570710","5571730"," You're a musician."
"5571890","5574970"," They went to graphic design just because all of my buddies went to design and knew no money or"
"5574970","5576490"," music for me commercial arts made sense. "
"5577150","5578230"," Yeah, that makes sense too, right?"
"5579650","5582410"," You want to be an artist, but you have to make a living too."
"5586020","5587420"," I think we'll see four hundred and spy."
"5587620","5588400"," I'm long calls, man. "
"5589200","5590700"," My money is where my mouth is, so."
"5592540","5593640"," I'm long calls right here."
"5605180","5607180"," And today, Dan say why?"
"5607600","5608740"," Well, I missed you, Joe. "
"5609560","5610160"," Hold on, Joe."
"5610300","5611240"," I'm trying to find out what's going on."
"5611500","5613760"," I'm down today because I chased the hole in the drop bit. "
"5614540","5616340"," I'm having any of Wendy's face fingers crossed."

"5620400","5621440"," You scholarship program. "
"5622340","5622920"," No, hold on."
"5623020","5623640"," I just want to help."
"5624140","5626280"," That's what I need to know what style you're looking for. "
"5626700","5627640"," Yeah, I'll show you."
"5627680","5628720"," I'll write something up today."
"5628840","5630100"," So if you DM me, what I'll do is this. "
"5630520","5633400"," I'll type up and then I'll show pictures and stuff."
"5633600","5638370"," Oh, 397."
"5638430","5648400"," Oh, 397 C is now trading $1.16. $1.15 right now. "
"5652070","5655470"," I'm looking for a price target right here, 397.80. And then I'm going to be looking."
"5655770","5657450"," I'm going to take these off up here."
"5657650","5659050"," So I'm going to show you what I'm looking for here. "
"5659190","5659290"," Okay."
"5660250","5661890"," I'm going to snap a line right here."
"5662790","5665570"," So I'm going to look to take these off and reenter again. "
"5666850","5670230"," For, for a possible next leg above PT one, right?"
"5670950","5672690"," So I want to see these print out."
"5674090","5675090"," I'll end up selling."
"5675730","5677230"," I'm looking to sell right up here. "
"5677810","5678290"," Okay."
"5678450","5679730"," So I've got no stops right now."
"5681170","5684210"," Speed up your broadcast so that you can catch up with me. "
"5685090","5685950"," Pay attention."
"5686770","5690290"," So you know what I'm doing here, right?"
"5695070","5696090"," I'm going to sell up here."
"5703090","5703250"," Right. "
"5703470","5704350"," This little line right here."
"5704350","5706330"," This isn't really like a cell line."
"5706450","5709150"," This is more of a consolidation line. "
"5709610","5714070"," I'm going to look for price to come higher right here."
"5714790","5718130"," Bounce off and start to consolidate lower at some point right here."
"5718730","5722830"," And hopefully you get a trade higher or we get a trade down to this white line. "
"5723670","5726830"," And we start to make our way higher once this red line comes through."
"5727010","5727050"," Right."
"5727170","5729150"," It's a nice little actually nice little trade right here too. "
"5730970","5733510"," So I'm going to set this up for you here."
"5734350","5735730"," I got the sell up here somewhere."
"5736710","5737050"," Right. "
"5737250","5739650"," I'm going to put this to the side so you can see where it is."
"5740650","5747030"," Now trade $1.19. I want to get some price here man."
"5748350","5751090"," I don't want to see what I'm afraid of here is I don't want to see like. "
"5751730","5755430"," I want to see they grind these calls down today."
"5756770","5758330"," Any kind of noise like that."
"5759090","5765690"," Now trade $1.20.22. I might actually hold these fucking things. "
"5766710","5769630"," Like if they go deep in the money they could be like three bucks by end of day."
"5769910","5771490"," Two three dollars something like that."
"5771790","5772630"," It's a good fucking price. "
"5773550","5775450"," I wonder if I can get these up to like two or three bucks."
"5775870","5777850"," They're $1.20. $1.19 right now."
"5780480","5785300"," $1.21. I hate when they fucking grind this shit down. "
"5786420","5787980"," They got to be kind of deep in the money."
"5788420","5798290"," $1.22. $1.23. You can always speed"
"5798290","5800350"," up your playback so that you're live with me here."
"5801350","5802230"," So you know what I'm doing. "
"5802230","5804470"," You have to make your own decisions what you do right."
"5804690","5806490"," That's nothing to do with what you do."
"5806590","5808270"," The risk that you take on any of that kind of stuff. "
"5809470","5811950"," $1.22. You guys know I'm capping paper hands."
"5812190","5812950"," So as I get up here."
"5813790","5820230"," I'll never hold through until they hit like $1.40. $1.60. I take money and I run usually $1 "
"5821600","5823900",".18. $1.19 coming down a little bit. "
"5825220","5826520"," Still not wanting to pay."
"5840160","5841380"," Give up the money baby."
"5842560","5844100"," Give up the money. "
"5846390","5847430"," Show me your skirt."
"5863730","5873470"," $3.97.97. There's another target up here $3.97.97. That's right here $3 "
"5873470","5876930",".97.97. Right here."
"5879600","5881280"," There's a target above here. "
"5881920","5882880"," I'm trying to sell this down."
"5895310","5910030"," I'm going to trade $1.10. Coming"
"5910030","5911470"," into a three trigger cluster too."
"5912530","5915010"," So we should get some, we should get a move here. "
"5915450","5917070"," Pretty violent move coming up here shortly."
"5940900","5942100"," Now I'm going to take a piss."
"5954720","5957200"," Just bouncing around $1.03 right now. "
"5958300","5959760"," Still haven't sold, still holding."
"5960940","5969600"," $1.04. It made me sit in these fucking things for the next 15, 20 minutes."
"5977550","5979730"," I'm going to put a stop limit in down here. "
"5979730","5982670"," Just so I don't, I don't want to fuck around down here."
"5986590","5991290"," I got a limit stop on $0.97. So I'm not upside down any longer."
"5991530","5997290"," I'm up to $1.11. We're coming into a three trigger cluster here. "
"5997370","5998130"," I want to show you this here."
"5999350","6000610"," I don't want to see a face ripper."
"6001910","6004790"," I'm going to try to see here is see this cluster right here. "
"6006910","6015990"," I want to see, I want to see this cluster come down and I want to see"
"6015990","6019590"," this one come up."
"6020350","6023830"," Then I want to see this orange one right here come up."
"6028150","6033470"," And I want to see price get up here just like this if I can. "
"6034970","6037450"," I'm looking for a pretty, pretty large squeeze here."
"6038690","6044770"," So I want to, I want that squeeze to go to 400 right there."
"6045650","6048230"," So I'm watching this to see what happens here. "
"6048350","6049510"," See if we can get this nice squeeze."
"6051810","6055890"," Let's see that squeeze get up there and squeeze this thing up nice and high."
"6058910","6060470"," So I'm going to be watching this here. "
"6066860","6068220"," $1 right now."
"6069560","6072140"," We got a limit stop on 97 cents."
"6072260","6073980"," So I got like another penny or two to go. "
"6074540","6075960"," I'm going to get stopped out right now."
"6100050","6103170"," God, this fucking market is taking so long."
"6110080","6110980"," I'm out right now. "
"6111000","6111460"," I'm flat again."
"6112260","6114180"," So now I'm flat right now in both of these trades."
"6114440","6116880"," I haven't made a single penny down here yet. "
"6117080","6117280"," Nothing."
"6118180","6118900"," I've been up twice."
"6119540","6121500"," I was up $1.22 at one point. "
"6122080","6125660"," My last trade owes up $1.26 or something like that."
"6126580","6129080"," And I got stopped out on that trade as well."
"6129340","6131280"," So I'm at 397s looking at him again. "
"6132200","6134400"," Still haven't seen a single fucking penny."
"6134580","6135620"," That's 40 some cents."
"6136340","6140100"," 50 cents on the day so far and that I've given up. "
"6140880","6142620"," So I haven't made a single penny at this point."
"6143700","6148060"," So I'm going to try to get back down here again and try to buy this one more time for"
"6148060","6148520"," a trip higher."
"6149640","6150820"," See if I can make some money here. "
"6161340","6165700"," I got this program in the background for you guys to watch my buys and sells."
"6166560","6168320"," And the moment that I get it up you're going to be stoked."
"6169240","6171220"," Just going to say Captain what I'm buying and what I'm selling. "
"6172160","6175300"," A little display from a green screen so you can see my positioning."
"6181590","6182790"," Then bought nothing yet."
"6182870","6183770"," I'm flat right now. "
"6201930","6204250"," It's a good time for me to take a piss too because I'm flat."
"6206370","6207450"," Maybe I just go flat."
"6208410","6209510"," There's right flat in there. "
"6223980","6233220"," Now this stays right here with the"
"6233220","6236600"," red mark right there."
"6245300","6246480"," Maybe five seconds."
"6246640","6247000"," I'll be right back. "
"6247080","6247880"," I'm going to take a quick piss."
"6248420","6249400"," I'll be right back with you guys."

"6412130","6413710"," Can't be traded in my life. "
"6413850","6417990"," I can't be changing what I do to please people out there."

"6455790","6456230"," Fuck. "
"6458010","6459430"," No, I'm all pissed off."
"6460150","6460790"," God damn it."
"6460870","6461630"," I can't please dude. "
"6461690","6463070"," I got to stop trying to please people."
"6463850","6464290"," Stop."
"6467990","6477510"," You got to take breaks. "
"6481860","6483020"," Yeah, I'm bullish here, man."
"6483740","6485080"," I'm completely bullish here."
"6485220","6485620"," I want to see. "
"6487480","6488840"," I'm super bullish in here."
"6489040","6490900"," I was on bullish until we get to 408."
"6495180","6498520"," I'm bullish to 408 and then I don't want to short this at all. "
"6499300","6500300"," I want to short."
"6505040","6506960"," Unless this is last leg down here."
"6508020","6509920"," Maybe this is last leg down here. "
"6512600","6516920"," I mean, personally, I wanted to short somewhere up in here."
"6517680","6521960"," I wanted to short like, yeah, up in here is what I wanted to short right here."
"6523140","6526260"," I wanted to short this like 404 and possibly even 408. "
"6526920","6528480"," So I would really like to have shorted."
"6530680","6532240"," I think it's right in here."
"6535360","6536300"," Yeah, that right there. "
"6536480","6537820"," That's the short that I want right up there."
"6541400","6546280"," But the 402404 somewhere in here was a valid short as well."
"6546680","6550500"," But I wanted it up here because all this shit is getting closed at some point. "
"6551120","6552160"," Or I think that it is."
"6552760","6553860"," All this is getting closed."
"6556920","6559880"," Oh, there's a bigger bearish cross right here. "
"6560560","6563360"," I was showing this to think of that captain's alpha."
"6563600","6565120"," I was like the big bear cross coming up here."
"6566260","6570160"," Big bearish on the four hour trend reversal up here. "
"6570280","6570760"," You can see it."
"6572480","6574560"," I think I pointed this out last name."
"6574660","6575940"," It said it wasn't that strong. "
"6576880","6577740"," So right here."
"6578620","6580840"," And it's not right now showing itself to be strong."
"6580960","6584200"," We're not seeing a violent price moves down. "
"6584500","6591580"," So it's going out to be seven year notes auction with US selling at $35 billion of seven year"
"6591580","6591880"," notes."
"6591880","6597780"," A prior bids cover of two to 69 and a prior high yield of three spots five, one, seven percent."
"6598240","6601100"," So just taking a look at some notes from analysts before this auction. "
"6601580","6605180"," So the auction may benefit from cheap looking relative valuation of the curve."
"6605660","6610240"," JP Morgan strategist said in a note that sector appears slightly cheap versus the wings."
"6610500","6613520"," After adjusting for the level yields at the shape of the curve. "
"6614060","6617720"," So primary dealers positions in the six to seven year sector were net long."
"6617720","6623000"," Seventeen spot $1 billion in the week ended February the eight versus 12 spot $1 billion."
"6623200","6623680"," Yeah. "
"6624260","6624740"," Yeah."
"6624920","6627220"," See if TC positioning data has been."
"6631160","6632680"," So hold on a second here. "
"6635440","6637900"," Some long calls on three ninety eight."
"6639600","6641060"," This could reverse right here."
"6641200","6642000"," So just be careful. "
"6642840","6646200"," You want if you're a bull out there and you want to take this trade, you probably want to wait"
"6646200","6646580"," for."
"6646580","6650660"," For this, the trade above and then get across."
"6651740","6653040"," I'll take this trade higher. "
"6654280","6655700"," But I don't want to miss this."
"6656000","6660270"," So win some lotos here."
"6680040","6687050"," Ninety seven eighty four pay attention to right up in here. "
"6687170","6688390"," It's three ninety seven eighty four."
"6690250","6694130"," This is where the bulls will get a squeeze right here."
"6695630","6697670"," Let's restart squeeze and if we can get above it. "
"6701190","6702210"," I'm long calls."
"6718860","6720420"," No, not boy, not boy."
"6721620","6721980"," Bye. "
"6729590","6731790"," I'm probably going to treat this as a lot of at this point."
"6731910","6732270"," This is a second."
"6732530","6735930"," Third time this morning that this would be the third time. "
"6735990","6738010"," Well, if I put a stop here, so I'm not going to fucking bother."
"6738610","6739450"," They fucking burn."
"6739570","6740150"," They fucking burn. "
"6741330","6742630"," I'll put some risk on here."
"6743910","6745730"," I don't want to see a reversal right here."
"6745790","6747130"," I'm looking for a break above. "
"6748250","6749790"," There could be a reversal here."
"6749970","6750470"," You could see."
"6750790","6754290"," I want to show you possible a probable path here. "
"6755430","6756950"," You want to be careful of this too."
"6758170","6760850"," You might want to wait until after, but right here."
"6763800","6765120"," Now, this is what I'm looking for. "
"6765180","6765800"," Something like this."
"6769600","6771280"," Leave that up for you so you can see it."
"6772540","6777800"," And I'm going to be looking for this line to come up here. "
"6778700","6780140"," For this line to come right down there."
"6782830","6784710"," There is high danger right here though."
"6787050","6788350"," There's danger right there. "
"6790170","6791390"," Because where the bears are hiding."
"6793450","6795270"," The bears want to sell right here."
"6796450","6797970"," They want a bloodbath this right here. "
"6801900","6803080"," Or they just sell side."
"6804840","6805300"," Sellers."
"6807040","6808340"," They're right up in here. "
"6818930","6819410"," 400."
"6821610","6822570"," Yeah, 442."
"6823230","6824470"," It's actually higher now. "
"6828900","6829660"," 442 cents."
"6829800","6831320"," P2 is raised even higher now."
"6836400","6837200"," Right there. "
"6842310","6843610"," Let's see if I can hold on here."
"6848120","6853440"," So yeah, I was asked why I had a comment or why I have comments on the screen that you"
"6853440","6853620"," see."
"6853640","6855220"," So you might be at home or an office. "
"6856100","6857840"," And you have the chat box open."
"6858660","6860900"," Where you can see the chat on the right hand side of your screen."
"6861760","6863520"," And you're contributing to the chat. "
"6864300","6866840"," But some people don't have access to that on their screen."
"6867020","6868160"," They might have a full screen open."
"6868840","6871760"," Some other people have smart TVs with the chat option. "
"6872400","6873200"," Some don't."
"6873860","6878240"," So I have had people send me screeners of big screen TVs that doesn't show the chat."
"6879220","6881360"," So for just context and stuff like that. "
"6881460","6882860"," I put the chat up on the left hand side."
"6883560","6884400"," For you guys."
"6892400","6893960"," I'll show you guys want to see a reversal. "
"6894240","6895680"," I'll show you a reversal path as well."
"6896100","6901040"," So if I was going after we get the seven year note auctions, the US selling $35 billion of seven"
"6901040","6901600"," year notes."
"6902000","6906240"," We were probably to cover two to 69 and a prior high yield of three spot five, one, seven percent. "
"6906780","6910100"," So you guys can see where the problems that lie here."
"6911060","6913020"," That would be a trap above like right up here."
"6925710","6927730"," So I was trying to come back and send this down. "
"6928390","6928890"," Goddamn it."
"6932770","6933490"," Hold on here."
"6933530","6936150"," Do I have more than that would work too?"
"6936350","6936750"," It's like that. "
"6940980","6941840"," I'm bullish here."
"6941940","6943660"," I'm watching this turn sideways and up."
"6944340","6945660"," So I'm taking the bull train here. "
"6950430","6951030"," Oh, nice."
"6951450","6951750"," Jamie Diamond."
"6952530","6955050"," Jamie Diamond saying there's still hope for a soft landing. "
"6955450","6957150"," The Fed has caught up and we'll have to pause."
"6957850","6958910"," But it might not be enough."
"6959970","6961090"," Jamie Diamond, man. "
"6961210","6962110"," He's like, we're long now."
"6962210","6962790"," Is that what he's saying?"
"6963550","6965370"," That goes against what Marco is saying."
"6965370","6966890"," Do you guys hear that shit?"
"6968010","6969250"," Jamie Diamond, baby. "
"6971370","6972190"," My man."
"6972970","6973930"," I like Jamie Diamond."
"6974790","6975830"," Believe it or not. "
"6989660","6990620"," Yeah, I'm long hair, man."
"6991420","6992860"," I don't want to get stopped out here."
"6993140","6994120"," Jamie Diamond, man. "
"6994580","6996580"," There is still hope for a soft landing."
"6997740","7000260"," The Fed has caught up and we'll have to pause."
"7000660","7002400"," But it may not be enough. "
"7003800","7006660"," Dude, I'm telling you the moment you even hear."
"7007480","7009220"," I'm warning you out there, okay?"
"7010020","7014520"," I make this warning all the time because I hear counter alpha all the time on this."
"7015440","7016880"," And I'm going to fucking warn you. "
"7018460","7019960"," Well, you'll see two scenarios."
"7020940","7023860"," They're going to front run a pause to the last leg down."
"7025100","7029520"," So if you think at any moment, and I was thinking about this last night, because of course I've got"
"7029520","7030060"," no power. "
"7031220","7033200"," So I'm like, I'll do some meditating."
"7034320","7040040"," And in my mind, I'm like, in my mind, I'm like, so you'll see this path here."
"7040120","7041340"," I'm going to show you this path real quick. "
"7042880","7044440"," See this white line right here?"
"7046080","7046680"," Look at me."
"7046760","7048740"," I can't believe I'm doing all this shit."
"7049240","7049620"," I only do. "
"7049720","7054420"," I'm only doing this because I wonder if you guys at home think about this stuff."
"7056580","7063140"," I'm only doing this because I want you guys in your own brains to like figure out what to expect"
"7063140","7063560"," here."
"7065780","7067400"," The sellers are right here, okay?"
"7068160","7069160"," They want to sell this. "
"7069940","7071420"," They want to trap me in right here."
"7074090","7078410"," Now, in my brain last night, I'm like, okay, let's start to just think about."
"7079070","7080830"," So Jamie Diamond's talking about this right now. "
"7080910","7083630"," He's like, there's still hope for a soft landing."
"7084370","7087270"," The fed is caught up and we'll have to pause, but it may not be enough."
"7088930","7090010"," It might not be enough. "
"7090190","7091770"," And I don't think that it ever will be."
"7091770","7100530"," We've had arguments on stream at times where people have said prices actually do come down and I'm"
"7100530","7101990"," like, no, no, they fucking don't."
"7102450","7106730"," I'm like, I'm old enough now where I've seen prices never come back on certain things. "
"7107650","7115350"," The companies build themselves around projecting out, hey, I can only charge so much for this."
"7115710","7120170"," And the next re-pricing event that we have, we're never bringing prices back down."
"7120170","7124910"," So surely expecting the seven-year no-tortune when issued expected at the top of the hour. "
"7126150","7127590"," Now, not only that, right?"
"7127750","7128530"," Here's another side of it."
"7128610","7129410"," So I'll tell you something."
"7129590","7131050"," I'll do a full disclosure with you. "
"7132650","7142270"," So I have family that are in, they produce, they raise large,"
"7142270","7145950"," large, vast quantities of cattle."
"7146830","7148950"," Right now cattle, no, they don't always do cattle."
"7149110","7154030"," Depends what the price of cattle is, cows or whatever, for consumption. "
"7155510","7162430"," So they raise anywhere from 1,500 to 7,000 head of cattle for consumption."
"7166450","7176370"," And, you know, what they talk about, what they talk about"
"7176370","7180390"," is to see sellers up here trying to sell it down."
"7182600","7188300"," Treasury when issued seven-year yield at 4 spot to 0, 4, 7% ahead of this $35 billion auction. "
"7189920","7194480"," What they talk about is, it's not just inflation."
"7196320","7198040"," There are other aspects of the cost of goods."
"7198040","7199780"," It's a string that's sponsored by Ticksright. "

"7209100","7211640"," You hear about demand destruction, right?"
"7211800","7212660"," We need demand destruction."
"7212900","7213600"," We need demand destruction. "
"7213900","7217780"," But the truth is, some of that demand destruction, you're not going to see."
"7220570","7224470"," So, this, as a matter of fact, our last conversation was a long time ago, it was about a pink"
"7224470","7224730"," slime."
"7226270","7227830"," And they, they quote unquote, band it. "
"7228030","7228470"," It's not banned."
"7229390","7235890"," They still do pink slime, which is like ground up, you know, like second, third tier."
"7236110","7236350"," Whoa. "
"7237310","7238610"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7240390","7241010"," Squeeze them."
"7242610","7248770"," Now trade an 89 cents on those 69, 67-cent calls. "
"7249110","7249470"," Excuse me."
"7249930","7251770"," 89 cents, now 85 cents."
"7255110","7257110"," So, I'm holding these fucking things. "
"7257310","7257750"," We're going up."
"7257970","7261490"," So, just trying to pierce the veil up here."
"7262910","7264130"," That was a beautiful trade right there. "
"7267280","7267960"," Right down here."
"7268000","7268620"," Remember this trade?"
"7273080","7279220"," So, the, the, you know, from their perspective when they're raising cattle, they're like, we don't"
"7279220","7283020"," want to, we don't want to, or like, we're to, they're trying to fucking reverse."
"7283460","7284140"," Come on. "
"7285280","7287440"," I'll be leading with the bit to cover ratio."
"7287880","7289320"," So, I want to show you guys something here."
"7289400","7291040"," I'm going to stop my, my story time. "
"7293740","7294980"," So, you can see this here."
"7295900","7300560"," We're coming into a three trigger cluster right now."
"7301400","7302300"," You need that shit. "
"7303680","7309100"," When I come on, fin to it sometimes, when I say expect a violent move, you're going to expect one"
"7309100","7309360"," here."
"7310020","7311040"," Does it go up or down?"
"7311180","7311580"," I don't know."
"7312100","7313460"," Well, you tend to see these. "
"7313600","7316560"," When you come into these clusters right here, you'll see violent moves in the market."
"7317400","7319200"," And they get very, very violent."
"7320800","7323980"," So, we're going to see if we blast up or blast down. "
"7325040","7330020"," It's not, it's, it's more of a bullish cluster in my viewpoints, but they're going to try to set."
"7330020","7334380"," This is what the bears need to get lower prices is they need."
"7334960","7339980"," They need this trend to come down to try to break through below here. "
"7340160","7342120"," So, these bears really want to sell this market bad."
"7342780","7350560"," They want to send down the five minute, the daily trigger and try to bloodbath this down to 39479."
"7352040","7357560"," We're going to see though, if this weekly moving average is going to hold up very, very emotional"
"7357560","7359700"," level right here. "
"7360180","7363040"," It's a breakthrough, very, very difficult to break through."
"7363240","7366360"," When we do break through it, it can be very violent."
"7366720","7371460"," So, I want you to be aware of that and get really violent straight down or really violent straight"
"7371460","7371960"," up here. "
"7373520","7375600"," And I am on the call side here."
"7376320","7379180"," I'm the bullish side of this squeezing higher."
"7382870","7383730"," So, back to Pink Slime. "
"7384010","7384990"," You saw it right there, right?"
"7385250","7385910"," Quick violent moves."
"7389150","7390970"," Quick, quick violent moves right here."
"7392850","7394550"," We're sitting right on it right now. "
"7401300","7404860"," So, anyways, this Pink Slime stuff, right?"
"7405000","7406140"," They were all scratching their heads."
"7406500","7409200"," They're like, why don't they think, so they live out the middle of nowhere."
"7410840","7413920"," And they live out the middle of nowhere. "
"7414000","7416000"," And they don't care if you eat Pink Slime or not."
"7416300","7421760"," What they care about is they're like, do these people not realize that the US population just"
"7421760","7422880"," continues to grow?"
"7422880","7428820"," And the demand for beef constantly goes up, right?"
"7429120","7430540"," Same with everything else, corn."
"7431580","7437080"," When you're consuming food, you need more of it, right?"
"7437320","7440780"," So, if the population grows, you need to produce more. "
"7441420","7446580"," And if we don't have available land to produce food, doesn't matter if it's corn or if it's sugar,"
"7446840","7447660"," it doesn't matter what it is."
"7448260","7451080"," But that kind of demand, you're not going to be able to destroy."
"7451300","7457660"," People are always going to want to get ground beef or eat at a McDonald's or eat at a, I"
"7457660","7460740"," don't know, Wendy's or something like Joe was talking about earlier. "
"7461620","7463920"," And so, some of that demand, you're not going to get rid of."
"7464240","7469460"," So, we argue sometimes in here about, well, you'll see lower prices once we destroy demand."
"7470700","7474000"," But there's a limit to that destruction of demand as my point. "
"7475100","7480540"," So, as a food producer, it's not like they can go out there and say, yeah, we've got land for"
"7480540","7482000"," 7,000, had a cattle."
"7482500","7486320"," And we can just add another three or 10,000 head because there's demand right now."
"7487240","7489160"," It's just not the land available for it. "
"7490740","7493360"," So, part of that demand will never go away."
"7493620","7500280"," And in these companies, my point there, or to that point, is that these companies like beef"
"7500280","7506340"," producers, you as a consumer of beef or anything else in life."
"7506620","7511720"," If it's milk, eggs, if it's, I don't know, you come up with it. "
"7511800","7517200"," If it's your favorite, if it's like a peroxide or something from the beauty section of your store."
"7517900","7523120"," If it's, if it's, I don't know, I'm trying to get different sections."
"7523120","7529140"," If it's like earrings that you buy regularly or hair ties that you buy. "
"7529420","7533940"," If it's your favorite socks, if it's your, I don't know, favorite underwear."
"7534940","7539260"," I have to try to figure something out here to relate this to, but these companies can't really"
"7539260","7540260"," change their pricing."
"7541400","7545900"," But for every decade or so, right?"
"7546200","7548240"," So they're always looking for that event where they can. "
"7549120","7553940"," Because you're going to always go and be like, yeah, I buy my T-shirts and they always cost me"
"7553940","7555300"," 10 bucks for a packet 10."
"7556180","7559640"," And so for the next 10 years, you're like, especially if you're a young person, you're like,"
"7559880","7560840"," they're 10 bucks a packet."
"7562160","7565820"," And so for that 10 years, you're not expecting the price of those to go up. "
"7566400","7573340"," You'll actually seek out deals on some other T-shirts or wait to buy that T-shirt until it's on"
"7573340","7575900"," sale at that $10 price that you're always wanting to buy."
"7575900","7580580"," When you hear about people being frugal, or you hear about someone saying, oh, I'm going to buy,"
"7580920","7583240"," I'm only going to buy butter when it's $3 a pound."
"7583480","7585760"," I'm going to, people own like deep freezers, right?"
"7586060","7590440"," They're like, I go out there and I buy mayonnaise whenever it's on sale for a dollar because it's"
"7590440","7593140"," now costing 7 bucks or 3 bucks or something. "
"7594180","7596320"," So some of that stuff is always going to go up."
"7599240","7601340"," So anyways, that's just on pricing."
"7601340","7606560"," But now Jamie Diamond saying, the Fed has caught up and we'll have to pause, but it may not be"
"7606560","7606860"," enough. "
"7607020","7611540"," And that's my, to that point is, what does he mean by it may not be enough?"
"7611920","7619640"," I think that's kind of a, or not genuine, or not quite a genuine statement."
"7621340","7629240"," He knows, and economists know, and right down to the producer, know that they only have certain"
"7629240","7631800"," chances to raise their pricing."
"7632180","7632600"," They know it. "
"7633560","7635400"," They build this into their modeling."
"7637100","7645180"," So you know, you know, if you have an event that raises prices on eggs, you see the chicken deaths"
"7645180","7649280"," around the world, and it's a really small percentage of the egg production that we do."
"7649780","7653540"," It's really not that much, but it's blown up into this. "
"7654160","7655240"," We've got an egg shortage."
"7655320","7656520"," We totally fucked up."
"7656740","7658900"," And you're like, this is a fucking lie. "
"7659360","7666780"," This is egg producers that have been getting fucked over at 99 cents a dozen for the past 10, 20"
"7666780","7667080"," years."
"7668020","7673700"," And they want, they want anything they can grasp onto to get 3, 4 bucks a dozen."
"7674720","7677740"," Because they know they can't raise prices for another decade or two. "
"7678600","7680960"," So you take what you can when you can take it."
"7680960","7686480"," And you really can, as a consumer of eggs, be demanding eggs to be a dollar again."
"7686780","7688940"," I'm sorry, because you put those people out of business. "
"7689780","7692300"," Matter of fact, large companies put those people out of business."
"7692520","7696240"," Now you've got corporations that are working on the smallest of margins, right?"
"7697220","7702560"," And they probably have some very smart people that are like, we'll make up any shit to keep eggs at"
"7702560","7703560"," 3 bucks a dozen."
"7704420","7707760"," We'll raise, we'll jacket the seven and take it back down to three. "
"7707760","7711280"," And we're now still up 300% of what we're charging for eggs."
"7712160","7712460"," Right?"
"7712740","7715880"," And we're good for the next decade until the next bullshit comes down the road."
"7716240","7720900"," That bullshit, but you know, some kind of event that we hit inflation again. "
"7721840","7724740"," So I don't understand exactly what Jamie Diamond saying on this, right?"
"7725220","7726720"," Fed has caught up and we'll have to pause."
"7727320","7730920"," And this is where I did my deep thinking last night was I was thinking about the front running of"
"7730920","7731400"," that pause."
"7732200","7736780"," How far out in time that takes for that front run and for the market to go down. "
"7737260","7741000"," In bottom because in my mind, I'm like, okay, so."
"7743300","7748660"," The last rate decision when they when they kept blabbing about they're not done with rate cuts."
"7749540","7755220"," More than likely going to add a couple more on top of what the plan was the terminal rate. "
"7756920","7761380"," When they were probably going to sell this market into that news that they weren't going to add any"
"7761380","7762060"," more rate cuts."
"7762660","7764820"," So that's probably three months, right?"
"7765040","7766780"," Let's just try to like critical think here."
"7767380","7772740"," If they had said in the last rate decision meeting. "
"7774780","7779040"," We're not planning on adding any more rate or any more rate increases."
"7779260","7782260"," We're going to stay the course with the terminal rate."
"7782260","7783320"," We've got two more. "
"7785920","7788820"," Twenty five VPS additions here, right?"
"7789960","7793840"," You probably think that it probably said they would if they had started to front run that selling."
"7794240","7797520"," Probably take three months, maybe six months."
"7797580","7802000"," So if you think out there, this is my warning to you, right?"
"7802100","7808060"," If you think out there, if you're like, okay, when are they going to stop increasing rates from"
"7808060","7808260"," here?"
"7808260","7814340"," You should probably be ahead of it by a quarter in the stock market, like three months. "
"7815600","7819660"," So start to plan on that out there for that last like down."
"7819920","7829840"," When is that pause coming and when will they begin to signal an end to rate"
"7829840","7830220"," increases?"
"7830220","7834520"," I'm wondering now reading this story from Jamie Diamond."
"7834860","7839640"," Is he trying to say the feds going to pause here?"
"7839760","7841420"," I just want to get it down to 380 and 360. "
"7841460","7844340"," So my JPM caller prints nice and fat."
"7845380","7851760"," So is his drive here in this statement to keep the market low for his collar?"
"7852080","7856460"," Is this drive to keep the market from trading out of control higher?"
"7857060","7859300"," Is the drive or is the drive?"
"7860460","7869660"," That he's trying to help me out as a retail trader to say that to expect a next like that,"
"7869760","7870780"," which I don't think he is."
"7870920","7875900"," I think he gives two fucks about you or I out there. "
"7876180","7882520"," I don't think he's trying to tell you anything that you might have to figure out your own."
"7886810","7891510"," So the fed has caught up and will have to pause, but it may not be enough."
"7892090","7894250"," It's like a two part bullshit quote. "
"7895910","7898170"," Neither of them make any sense or not make any sense."
"7898830","7900630"," Neither of them mean what they really mean."
"7901170","7901690"," This is my point. "
"7916020","7916760"," It's actually green."
"7919000","7920300"," Moss withos amigos."
"7928080","7930080"," Yeah, I like, I agree with you too. "
"7930200","7931820"," I like Jamie Diamond."
"7932700","7934260"," I've always been a fan of his."
"7936040","7938840"," He's a very intelligent person and very smart. "
"7940780","7944760"," I want Jamie Diamond believer, but I just wonder what is the impact of what he's saying is in the"
"7944760","7945060"," market."
"7945760","7947420"," He's speaking to two different audiences."
"7947420","7950340"," He's speaking to one audience and then another audience. "
"7951520","7956300"," So you kind of have to decide which audience or how are you interpreting what he's saying."
"7958670","7959650"," What does it mean to you?"
"7967000","7967880"," Yeah, I'm long here."
"7968240","7969320"," We're in a cluster right now. "
"7969500","7970500"," I want to see a face dripper."
"7975100","7976240"," I don't know if it's liars pogger."
"7976240","7977520"," You guys hear like, um. "
"7978620","7983260"," Like, you know, it's one of my favorite things to do is you watch, uh, like, like, Yellen will come"
"7983260","7985380"," out on 60 minutes and be like."
"7987360","7988820"," She's lying to me."
"7989160","7992760"," She's lying to some guy who's got a high school education that doesn't know anything. "
"7993680","7995020"," About basic economics."
"7996580","7997020"," Right."
"7998100","7999860"," She's like, we're trying to protect Main Street. "
"8000100","8002200"," I'm like, you ain't fucking trying to protect Main Street."
"8002240","8003700"," You're trying to fucking torch Main Street."
"8004600","8007680"," But they can't come out on 60 minutes and tell people that, right?"
"8009900","8012700"," Uh, they can't say we want you to lose your job. "
"8013480","8015060"," And we know that you have bad debt."
"8016060","8017880"," And we know your max that your credit cards."
"8018060","8019400"," We know you don't have any savings. "
"8020320","8022600"," We know that you're in your third mortgage on your house."
"8023660","8026000"," We know your wife probably wants to divorce you."
"8026180","8027740"," We're going to strip you of all that shit. "
"8028820","8031300"," They don't, they're not going to say that on 60 minutes."
"8031300","8034220"," It would be like a revolt, right?"
"8034980","8040460"," Because as a, as you as a consumer out there, you don't think they're talking to you, right?"
"8041020","8044540"," So you're like, I don't know, you're a mechanic or something and you work your ass off."
"8045620","8049280"," And you see wealthy people doing well during a recession. "
"8049540","8051780"," And you're like, you know, fuck those people up there."
"8053140","8061600"," And in reality, oftentimes, like people don't realize that they're not coming after those people,"
"8061700","8062480"," they're coming after you."
"8063960","8064980"," You know, you're lied. "
"8065140","8066000"," You basically lied to."
"8068540","8070960"," They actually want to get rid of your bad debt."
"8073040","8076500"," Because of the mistakes that you made or the bad investments that you made. "
"8077200","8084580"," And those kind of things, the over, over indulgence living above your means, that kind of stuff."
"8085840","8087720"," And they want to give someone younger a chance."
"8092230","8094210"," Older people know this, but young people have no idea. "
"8094210","8097070"," Like the people that, and they're, well, and I shouldn't say that."
"8097410","8100570"," Like when I should say older people, that's probably misnomer as well."
"8101510","8103410"," I think a lot of America doesn't know this. "
"8104030","8112990"," I think generally speaking, people go to work, they come home, and they go about their lives."
"8113570","8120250"," They have no idea that there's a capitalistic system that's built around short long-term debt"
"8120250","8123650"," cycles that clean out people and let new ones back in."
"8123650","8125130"," It's our system functions. "
"8129770","8131570"," Yeah, that's true."
"8132170","8133870"," There's like a story, right?"
"8134270","8137590"," Sold to regular people."
"8138190","8140990"," And they get a story for Wall Street, right?"
"8144350","8149830"," Even the stuff this past week, I was reading some of the Putin and Biden stuff, and I'm like, man,"
"8150630","8153230"," like all these people are running these stories. "
"8153850","8157050"," And then you got people that are fired up on all this shit."
"8157050","8161290"," And I'm like, man, this shit has nothing to do with a real war with Russia."
"8161290","8162910"," This has to do with the stock market. "
"8163390","8165670"," It's like, it's all has to do with money."
"8166770","8170430"," It has like nothing to do with a real war with Russia."
"8182910","8183150"," Yeah. "
"8189340","8190520"," Come into a good batch of gas."
"8193990","8195129"," Yeah, no, I'm still long."
"8195430","8198389"," I'm just long here waiting for this cluster to do its thing. "
"8199110","8200270"," Just putting around right now."
"8216299","8218840"," Yeah, the hourly is turning very bullish right now."
"8220980","8225440"," I'm watching the hourly in the background, creating extremely bullish here. "
"8236360","8237400"," Yeah, no, I disagree."
"8238340","8238879"," 100%."
"8238879","8240160"," I disagree all day long. "
"8242100","8243440"," You can see it right here."
"8246820","8248160"," We're getting pretty bullish here."
"8254280","8256240"," This is the hourly velocity right here. "
"8258100","8259340"," And I'll show you this."
"8260620","8261500"," Let's see it right here."
"8262440","8263200"," This right here. "
"8263280","8264700"," This is where that squeeze happens right here."
"8266360","8268940"," And you'll start to see this cranking here."
"8271660","8273520"," You'll see these bars go up like this. "
"8277730","8279570"," And you should see a nice fat squeeze here."
"8280850","8282309"," That's something else happening I don't see."
"8284830","8286250"," Pretty fucking bullish right now. "
"8287150","8291389"," Even if price isn't showing it, I'm very bullish right here."
"8296879","8298820"," One might say extremely bullish."
"8329080","8331660"," Time is bullish as it could be here. "
"8332940","8339820"," I'm like, I'm actually bullish blast off up here."
"8341180","8344700"," That's the kind of bullish I am right now."
"8344700","8347260"," Like, violet move bullish. "
"8352459","8356480"," Like, maybe like a 300% printer somewhere in there."
"8357620","8358139"," 340%."
"8359219","8361400"," I'm as bullish as you can be right now. "
"8369770","8371030"," I'm just long right now."
"8372010","8373930"," I want it to print like $1.50 or something."
"8375969","8376850"," Something stupid. "
"8383920","8385580"," These sellers are not here anymore either."
"8388670","8389530"," Nothing I can see."
"8390810","8392610"," You should start ramping here in just a minute. "
"8397360","8399180"," Like you saw that squeeze in the after hours."
"8399420","8401560"," We'll probably get one of those right now in the regular market."
"8404300","8405560"," I'm fairly certain of this. "
"8410230","8411490"," Get out your rocket ship beams."
"8416500","8417840"," They can say whatever they want."
"8424690","8432350"," Get out the rocket fuel and get out your astronaut costumes. "
"8433910","8453140"," Just pay"
"8453140","8454420"," these fucking calls."
"8455260","8456060"," Pay them."
"8458380","8459980"," How are you guys doing out there?"
"8462300","8463720"," Everybody doing well today?"
"8467140","8470480"," Look at this fucking nonsense down here. "
"8470480","8471440"," How long is this taken?"
"8471920","8473360"," What fucking time is it?"
"8473540","8475980"," It's $1.21 in the afternoon."
"8479000","8480320"," When did this shit start?"
"8481140","8483400"," It's a pain in the ass looking at this stuff sometimes."
"8483760","8484180"," I'll tell you what. "
"8484740","8486140"," Like, pay me the fucking money."
"8487120","8489020"," The waiting all fucking morning to take a trade."
"8489200","8490080"," I took two trades. "
"8491680","8493000"," They put stop limits on."
"8493620","8495780"," They could have made 50, 60 cents or some nonsense."
"8496380","8497640"," Now I'm in a third fucking trade. "
"8499970","8501350"," And now I'm just like fucking."
"8501350","8502970"," I'm just going to hold them until they go to zero."
"8503730","8505350"," So fucking pay me, man. "
"8506130","8506790"," No stops."
"8508410","8509470"," No seat belts."
"8509910","8510510"," No airbags. "
"8514590","8515950"," Just fucking print it."
"8516710","8518510"," I know you're going to print it at some point."
"8521590","8523210"," I know what's going on here. "
"8523610","8524290"," So let's go."
"8529550","8530390"," Yeah, dude."
"8533670","8535430"," I'm like, this is bullshit here. "
"8537690","8539130"," You know how this shit goes, right?"
"8539230","8542010"," We sit here for like an hour or two and then it just fucking screams."
"8551010","8551690"," All gas."
"8558230","8559890"," I used to trade teachers. "
"8560090","8560650"," I don't do it anymore."
"8561530","8562670"," I was thinking about it."
"8564950","8566170"," I was offered. "
"8567830","8569350"," You know what I was offered to."
"8569630","8572850"," I've been offered fucking three times now to trade apex."
"8576350","8579030"," And I could do like a class on. "
"8579330","8582450"," What I could do is do a class on apex with you guys."
"8583930","8586710"," Teach you guys how to pass the apex class."
"8588410","8591230"," And you guys could sign up for it if you wanted to. "
"8592650","8595930"," I could be kind of neat to do an apex class like a series."
"8597430","8599730"," So you guys can see how you can actually."
"8602370","8608530"," It's in the back burner, but I'm looking at it right now to possibly do like a series where. "
"8609670","8611270"," I'll go through the class."
"8612310","8613770"," I'll go through the test with you."
"8614610","8616590"," Record the test and passing it. "
"8616590","8620430"," And then you guys would be able to sign up for it if you wanted to."
"8621550","8623630"," To trade through apex, but."
"8627640","8630480"," Now you can see how you pass that shit and. "
"8631540","8632740"," How you get funded."
"8634600","8636300"," And trade somebody else's money."
"8641970","8645430"," And just do a class that you guys just live stream that shit all day long. "
"8646850","8647910"," Fairly easy to pass."
"8647910","8650190"," I think I think it costs two 50 or three 50."
"8651710","8652610"," Something like that. "
"8654070","8656750"," And I know some of you guys like apex and stuff or."
"8657690","8659270"," Prop prop trade like that."
"8659510","8659670"," So. "
"8662740","8665160"," That trade that trades futures, I believe."
"8675780","8676640"," No way."
"8676960","8677420"," Really?"
"8678440","8682160"," Yeah, I haven't done anything with apex, but I didn't know that there's suspect on that. "
"8683280","8686040"," If I don't do it, do you have another company."
"8686960","8687860"," To do it with."
"8695850","8696330"," Yeah. "
"8697250","8699210"," Do you have any better prop firms?"
"8699910","8702230"," Because I've been offered twice now and."
"8703750","8705150"," Do you recommend someone else?"
"8722150","8723170"," Yeah, trade day."
"8728860","8729940"," All right, this down. "
"8732930","8733870"," Who would you like me?"
"8734010","8735310"," Who would you like to see me do it with?"
"8737390","8738510"," Who's the other company?"
"8738730","8741330"," I'm missing so many of you guys are doing you profit."
"8743850","8745110"," If you had me do."
"8746130","8748510"," If you had me do one of these companies, which one would it be?"
"8753310","8754050"," Top step. "
"8762260","8764600"," Yeah, the time limit thing bothers me."
"8765600","8767380"," Who who has no time limits?"
"8767980","8769780"," Alex, which company has no time limits?"
"8770520","8772120"," That's one of the things that bothers me."
"8773800","8775980"," About some of these prop houses is that. "
"8776500","8779920"," You're forced to trade when it's not a good day to trade."
"8780880","8786360"," If I did these videos, I would more than likely want to show you the best days to trade."
"8787000","8791680"," But one of the bad parts about or one of the negative parts about live streaming. "
"8792940","8795680"," Is I don't get to trade the best days."
"8796340","8800060"," So you can kind of figure out the best days to trade what the best trades."
"8800340","8804120"," So if I was to just trade the best days, you guys would never see me on. "
"8806240","8808120"," So I was talking to somebody."
"8809000","8810780"," I don't know if it's Chaz or someone."
"8811040","8812300"," Chaz or Joe or someone. "
"8812980","8821040"," I was like there's the great days to trade, but there's always someone wanting to trade."
"8822680","8827640"," So when you live stream, you get people that show up and they want to trade every day."
"8827860","8830860"," You get some people that have a job and they only have Thursdays off. "
"8831520","8832240"," Two trades."
"8832520","8834140"," So they're like, well, I don't care what the market is doing."
"8834560","8836440"," I just want to get some skin in the game on a Thursday. "
"8837520","8839580"," And I'm not available rest of the week."
"8840000","8842120"," So there's always someone that wants to trade the market."
"8844780","8846400"," So it's hard when you're streaming. "
"8847220","8852700"," But if I did like a recorded video series and if you don't have what was just commented."
"8854620","8856000"," Where you have to be trading."
"8857000","8862280"," That's one of the big, like if you're going to trade, being a trade for a prop trade. "
"8862420","8867500"," And there's good days and bad days to trade like easy days, right?"
"8867960","8871580"," Like you put all these stack yourself in your favor that you're going to win."
"8879380","8881140"," Yeah, you profit the offers that."
"8882940","8884680"," I'll check out those companies and see. "
"8894150","8896050"," They do have trailing drawdown on trade day."
"8896770","8900130"," Seems like all these companies have one or two rules that fuck you over, right?"
"8901050","8902550"," There's like an intent to fuck you over."
"8910680","8911860"," I'll look at all three of them. "
"8911860","8913060"," I'll take a look at them and have a chance."
"8916240","8917240"," Yeah, I'll take a look at."
"8920140","8928480"," I'll take a look at all those three right there and see if they have drawdowns or even required"
"8928480","8928940"," trading. "
"8929560","8930060"," That's the one."
"8930580","8934900"," I'm like, man, if the market sucks, may I get that there's always something to trade?"
"8935320","8937060"," So I mean, there's two sides to this story, right?"
"8937740","8942020"," If the spy is not trading one day, or if ES is not trading one day, you can move over"
"8942020","8948750"," to IWM or you can move over to energy or excuse me, RTY."
"8951390","8953610"," If you can always move to something else. "
"8953830","8959770"," But the truth is, if you're trading your own money, even if you look at my profits before I was"
"8959770","8962130"," streaming, way higher than they are streaming."
"8962710","8963310"," I have to trade everything."
"8963530","8966510"," I trade the good shit, the bad shit. "
"8966510","8968310"," I trade like days where I don't want to be trading."
"8969570","8973550"," And then, you know, of course, I try to be here in the great days, but I can't even, some"
"8973550","8974810"," days I'm not here in the great days."
"8975070","8980070"," I've missed trading days because I trade so frequently live streaming, but I can't be here in the"
"8980070","8980550"," best days. "
"8981630","8984270"," So it's very random when I can be here and not be here."
"8985830","8987110"," I'm not a trade with you."
"8987330","8993290"," So when you have the choice, when you're like, I'm only going to trade these conditions, it's so"
"8993290","8994030"," much fucking easier. "
"9016250","9017130"," Around outs."
"9018950","9019730"," Right on, man."
"9021170","9022490"," Yeah, people want to trade every day. "
"9022770","9031570"," There's, well, in that same conversation, in that same conversation, I was having, I was saying,"
"9031910","9035610"," I've become a better trader overall because I have traded such dog shit days."
"9036670","9038190"," It makes me a better trader."
"9038790","9039950"," Like, how's it impact on you?"
"9041310","9045230"," Because you know the good days and the bad days, trend days, not trend days. "
"9045230","9049950"," You can kind of identify where to take profit, that kind of stuff."
"9050330","9052490"," Much better when you trade all the shit days."
"9053190","9059790"," But as a trader, it's a no brainer to take days off and just wait for the best days, like"
"9059790","9060510"," trend days, right?"
"9065280","9069780"," No, I just, so I've got to spy up here and I just don't tend to trade. "
"9070200","9077840"," I trade spy puts sometimes, but I want a big directional move, stuff like that."
"9078620","9083000"," I tend to trade better myself on call side, but calls are built to make money."
"9084260","9085140"," Puts are not. "
"9085680","9086920"," I use them as a hedge though."
"9087420","9089440"," If I'm along the market, I trade puts all the time."
"9090200","9091820"," By put hedges all the time. "
"9094960","9096440"," I just don't trade them."
"9097340","9101300"," You know, I'll be honest with you guys, but let's look at this point blank."
"9101680","9104980"," Like, market hasn't fucking crashed since June. "
"9105840","9108740"," So it doesn't matter if you're, oh, like south side of futures."
"9108740","9110480"," I like futures south side."
"9112900","9116800"," They make a lot of money doing, they make the same money that you do on the spy side. "
"9117060","9124460"," I like south side of futures, but in spy options, I call side for me."
"9124620","9130360"," If I was trading SPX, I would trade south side too, but I'm not trading SPX right now."
"9131120","9132280"," I'm just trading spy zero dates. "
"9133640","9134660"," I trade spreads too."
"9137050","9138530"," That's what I've been reduced to at this point."
"9138530","9144750"," The way this market is right now, I look for very oversold conditions to buy some spreads. "
"9145590","9146890"," I put some weight to the market."
"9147470","9149430"," I make my money that way, and then I trade."
"9149750","9151570"," I start with a small account. "
"9152590","9158450"," I try to limit myself about a thousand bucks, trade it up to 20, 30 grand, and take the money"
"9158450","9160670"," and run and restart with another thousand bucks."
"9161010","9165010"," If I blow the account up, I restart with a thousand bucks."
"9166630","9169990"," Then it's all funded from trading spreads. "
"9175000","9176860"," It keeps me in the market."
"9177040","9178640"," It keeps me sharp."
"9182370","9189950"," Of course, you think that you can tell yourself, you're like, I'm just going to place my spreads"
"9189950","9193230"," and I'm going to come back in the market, but the truth is you're like, I'm going to read the"
"9193230","9194310"," financial hot sheets. "
"9195490","9202370"," I'm going to watch CNBC, and then you're like, I'm going to watch Wall Street Bets."
"9203190","9206330"," Before you fucking know it, you're back in it again and you're trading again."
"9206890","9209510"," For me, that's the safe way for me to keep my money in. "
"9211670","9212630"," Stay sharp."
"9222870","9225950"," How to see it early enough to get in without getting burned."
"9229510","9234310"," We should do a segment on how to identify a trend day. "
"9235490","9238390"," They're pretty easy to identify."
"9238510","9245570"," Typically, how you can figure out when you're in trend days, for me at least, is on the one hour."
"9246210","9247350"," I'm just looking for a cross. "
"9248630","9255250"," If we're trending down or trending up, then once that cross is met, we'll normally have a trend day"
"9255250","9256010"," the following day."
"9257790","9259590"," It's fairly easy to identify."
"9262560","9266760"," The implied move in the market also tells you if we're going to have a trend or not. "
"9268560","9274220"," There's some IV stuff, some volatility stuff that don't apply, range expansion stuff."
"9275900","9278600"," News events just add all that shit up and kind of figure it out."
"9284030","9285890"," Yeah, I'm still in calls right now, man. "
"9285990","9288410"," I'm just fucking sitting here waiting for this bullshit to happen."
"9295640","9299080"," Can I apply in the relationship between spy, SPX, and DES?"
"9300020","9301760"," Oh, man, that's a big ass conversation."
"9301760","9306740"," And there's a lot of sneaky shit going on right now. "
"9307520","9313260"," There's traditional expectations of who's using which instrument."
"9315000","9320960"," Now there's questions of our dealers using just futures now."
"9322260","9326100"," Is it banks doing it, hedge funds to jump it into spy or not?"
"9326520","9327080"," There's new rules. "
"9328400","9329460"," I can do that for you."
"9329460","9331120"," I'll do a segment on it."
"9336370","9339090"," There's a lot of suspect talk going on in the background. "
"9341830","9348810"," If I was to talk to you about the cloudiness right now, I would say to you that all three"
"9348810","9358740"," instruments are suspect right now to me versus how they've been traditionally used."
"9362120","9363560"," Who's using them right now?"
"9364460","9375550"," What the intent of each one is, yeah, I"
"9375550","9375910"," would too."
"9377230","9382190"," If I only came on during trend days up or down, then be much better. "
"9382550","9389190"," But again, when it was like a hundred of us, that would be pretty fairly easy to do."
"9391070","9395010"," But now it's just it's turning into fucking some kind of a monster."
"9396370","9397450"," Dude, I get yelled at. "
"9397610","9398590"," I miss the stream."
"9399190","9400210"," People are like, get your ass."
"9400390","9401610"," And we don't even have a paid service. "
"9402570","9403770"," Like, we don't even have a paid service."
"9403790","9405510"," People are like, I want you on tomorrow."
"9406090","9407190"," I get DMs in this shit. "
"9407450","9409370"," People are like, you got your stream in tomorrow?"
"9409630","9410390"," I'm like, dude, I am."
"9411490","9412850"," Of course, some days I can't."
"9413570","9414810"," Like, streaming every day is hard. "
"9415230","9415790"," It's brutal."
"9417330","9418310"," It's not fun."
"9420770","9421890"," Like, there's fun days. "
"9422230","9424530"," Then there's a lot of work to two stream every day."
"9426700","9428020"," You know, then you have to be on spot."
"9428340","9434960"," You like the part about streaming is it doesn't matter if it's a good day or a bad day to"
"9434960","9436340"," stream and trade. "
"9436640","9437220"," You're there to trade."
"9439020","9439420"," Right."
"9439620","9440780"," So you like kind of forced into it. "
"9450560","9451160"," I'm sorry."
"9451280","9451560"," I'm missing one."
"9451660","9453980"," Some of you guys are your streams going to chat. "
"9453980","9455000"," That's going by so fast."
"9456560","9459100"," You guys can, I don't mind you guys DM me and ask me."
"9459220","9462100"," If you guys are, if you're hearing me right now and you're like, oh shit, I did that. "
"9462580","9463620"," It's fine that you ask."
"9464620","9465160"," It's fine."
"9465420","9465900"," I get it. "
"9467100","9467460"," No."
"9467620","9469280"," Dude, I trade days that I don't want to trade too."
"9469400","9472360"," I mean, I'm telling you, I only trade the best days among like my high horse. "
"9473380","9477400"," But I'll fucking come in the market on a day and be like, ah, let's see if we can make"
"9477400","9478040"," some money today."
"9479520","9480020"," You know?"
"9480900","9482680"," So don't feel like I'm not."
"9483220","9485540"," If I say to you like, I don't want to trade every day. "
"9485780","9487380"," I'm still fucking trying to trade."
"9488320","9492380"," When I'm not trading, I'm like doing research on a company I can buy or sell."
"9492860","9493160"," Like so. "
"9495850","9497170"," But you know, this is what this is."
"9497430","9498210"," Like what we're doing here."
"9498870","9500390"," Matter of fact, I was talking to a guy last night. "
"9500770","9504310"," I was trying to talk to a guy about doing some recorded videos."
"9507150","9512210"," And, you know, I want to have separate things, right?"
"9512210","9514550"," So you have like a live stream."
"9514610","9519370"," Then you have someone doing recap videos and expectation videos for the next day. "
"9519850","9521430"," You want to have a video on the weekend."
"9522230","9527230"," It'd be really cool to have somebody like, if we could have Winky on like Saturdays, do like a"
"9527230","9530290"," stock picking show on Saturday mornings, be fucking awesome."
"9531790","9531830"," Right?"
"9532470","9534590"," And sometimes you could ask Winky a bet. "
"9535050","9538670"," There's times when you want to buy stocks and times when you don't."
"9538870","9539910"," Times when you're trying to sell stocks."
"9542210","9544670"," You know, sometimes you have a show and sometimes you don't. "
"9545830","9550250"," But you know, at some point we want to have those different venues available to you."
"9550350","9553890"," So if you're trying to trade, there's a live stream for you."
"9554110","9559910"," If you're not a day trader, there's a video at nighttime recorded for you. "
"9560110","9565950"," If you're a stock buyer, if you're a stock seller, there's a video for you in Saturdays."
"9566510","9567630"," You plan out your whole entire week."
"9572290","9573850"," Oh, fucking a man. "
"9574430","9576510"," Dude, I'm up one penny in these calls."
"9577650","9580410"," I'm going to fucking grind set my ass into this bell."
"9581290","9583190"," My eyes are bleeding right here. "
"9591940","9593020"," Thanks, Cruz and man."
"9593560","9595960"," I mean, I know this helps you guys."
"9596480","9598560"," I know in the, and I appreciate your comment. "
"9599900","9601120"," I didn't have this."
"9601500","9602880"," So I paid for this."
"9603060","9606620"," So this time that I spend with you, I paid a lot of money. "
"9606620","9612320"," I spent to spend time with a day trader that taught me how to day trade."
"9612720","9613560"," I actually paid."
"9613700","9615140"," I paid 600 bucks a month. "
"9615880","9616460"," That's what I paid."
"9617080","9623000"," A lot of fucking money to learn how to trade."
"9623540","9628140"," So you want someone there with you?"
"9628820","9629480"," I get it. "
"9629740","9634440"," That's how the whole reason this whole stuff thing started was because I was tired of listening to"
"9634440","9637800"," people and bent to it going and on Wall Street bats."
"9638080","9640440"," I'm like, these motherfuckers are all on the wrong side of goddamn trade."
"9640740","9641200"," Everybody is. "
"9642120","9646580"," I guess you'd be hearing their closing puts or their closing calls and everyone's like, I'm fucking"
"9646580","9649360"," opening puts and I'm fucking opening calls."
"9649620","9652220"," I'm like, these motherfuckers are all on the wrong side of the trade."
"9652920","9657580"," And then there's a quiet group in that group that are like, you know, as people are like, I'm"
"9657580","9658140"," buying calls. "
"9659220","9660220"," There's a quiet group."
"9660400","9662480"," It's like, well, I'm fucking selling for profit here."
"9663080","9668420"," You know who talked about this yesterday was Victor Nederhopper over the past few days. "
"9669060","9670680"," Made some posts on Fintuit."
"9671600","9674920"," And what he was relating to was when stuff is cheap."
"9676240","9678460"," And you're the one doing the buying down there. "
"9678940","9680820"," And you've got two group screaming."
"9681180","9682420"," You've got the sell sell sell crowd."
"9683280","9685840"," So you're trying to buy when they're at the loudest. "
"9686680","9690060"," And you've got the people that aren't buying are very quiet."
"9690060","9694340"," And, you know, you're trying to hold it by and hold there."
"9694640","9696920"," And then you're trying to get to that point like the open today, right?"
"9697600","9699380"," Where someone wants those calls. "
"9700040","9703700"," And then when you hear people saying, man, I'm going to buy some calls."
"9704620","9707260"," You're like, okay, I'm going to, I have them right here."
"9707820","9708560"," You want them?"
"9709980","9712680"," And so you hand them to them and go, here's your calls, bro. "
"9713440","9714880"," And they buy those calls."
"9715280","9715780"," Does that make sense?"
"9716800","9719140"," Victor was talking about this on his Fintuit."
"9719740","9724220"," And, oh, we're now trading 91 cents right now. "
"9727160","9728360"," 91 cents."
"9730800","9732340"," What's going on?"
"9732920","9734300"," A little squeeze."
"9735660","9736360"," Now, 82 cents. "
"9736880","9737560"," What's happening here?"
"9738520","9740800"," What the hell is going on in the market right now?"
"9742040","9745500"," So, Victor Niederhofer, if you go to his profile, right?"
"9746480","9748660"," Tell him to say, Kevin Jim James sent me."
"9752000","9757060"," Say this guy, it's weirdo Kevin Jim James tries to decipher what you're saying."
"9759420","9761140"," And he talked about it this week. "
"9761320","9771200"," He was discussing some books and he was discussing the finer points of supply"
"9771200","9774820"," and demand in the market and how you can."
"9775220","9779420"," This was for a very fascinating listening or reading the stuff that he writes about."
"9781080","9785480"," And he's basically telling you, he's like, this thing here, treasury is extending the gains with"
"9785480","9786980"," the 5 to 38. "
"9787300","9787780"," Yeah, we already know."
"9788200","9789040"," We're in long calls."
"9789220","9789500"," We get it. "
"9790400","9794980"," So he's basically telling you, he's like, he's like, when you're, he's like, you're, he's like, you"
"9794980","9795900"," got a call or put."
"9795900","9797660"," He's like, I think he said, didn't matter."
"9797780","9799220"," His puts or calls didn't fucking matter. "
"9800060","9803640"," He was like, you've got, but his example is basically, you've got a call here."
"9805800","9807980"," And, or an underlying security, it doesn't matter."
"9808140","9809100"," You've got, let's see, you've got the spy. "
"9810400","9815020"," And you hear, all your hearing is, south, south, south, south, south, south, south."
"9815280","9815500"," Right?"
"9815940","9818340"," So when you're hearing this south, south, south, south, south, south, south, south, south, south,"
"9818340","9818500"," south, south, south."
"9818880","9820060"," And the price is low. "
"9821160","9824180"," So he mentioned like 20 to 20 day moving average."
"9824700","9826220"," He's like, I think it's time for the Dow or some."
"9827040","9829420"," He's like, all you hear is the, it gets louder itself. "
"9830280","9831000"," Price is high."
"9831420","9832160"," So, right?"
"9832780","9834240"," And you hear the price comes low in here."
"9834340","9834880"," South, south, south. "
"9835160","9836440"," And you can price gets lower in here."
"9836840","9838320"," South, south, south, south, south, south, south, south."
"9838460","9839680"," And down here, it's low price. "
"9840420","9841880"," And you're checking, hey, it's been 20 days."
"9842020","9843620"," And then you start hearing the coffee."
"9843880","9846520"," Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. "
"9846520","9848280"," Sell, sell, sell, it gets really loud."
"9848720","9850840"," And you're this person that's like, okay."
"9851780","9855280"," Man, I'm scared down here is fucking motherfuckers are saying, sell this shit. "
"9856480","9857520"," Everybody's saying it now."
"9857680","9859780"," You got bulls saying it, bears screaming it."
"9860380","9861420"," It's the loudest thing to hear. "
"9863100","9868080"," He's like, you see price come down over time and you see the screams to sell loud."
"9869000","9871180"," It's probably the time for you to buy that shit."
"9871580","9876180"," Like you buy it, you put it down over here, you put it inside your, your drawer of many things. "
"9877680","9884580"," And then you get quiet and you listen for the sellers screaming to get quiet."
"9885440","9891380"," And you listen for the buyers and you're like, okay, now I'm going to listen for people saying buy,"
"9891680","9892660"," buy, buy, buy, buy, buy."
"9893500","9894720"," And then really loudly, right?"
"9894940","9896980"," Buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy, right?"
"9897160","9898280"," The coffee and the rage. "
"9898560","9904860"," And you check that cheap ass thing that you bought and you go, wow, this is worth more money right"
"9904860","9905200"," now."
"9906400","9913200"," And he's using some mathematical functions for it and price and time functions."
"9914340","9917460"," And he was talking about, you know, then you hear the screaming buyers, right?"
"9917780","9918900"," Long calls here. "
"9920100","9922360"," Buy everything, buy everything, buy everything."
"9922360","9923400"," And the price is high."
"9923560","9927640"," If the price is high while you're hearing that, you fucking sell it to him. "
"9927740","9928180"," You're like, here you go."
"9928240","9928580"," You take it."
"9928700","9928840"," It's yours. "
"9929480","9930100"," I don't need it anymore."
"9931120","9934260"," I'm going to wait until the sellers are screaming, screaming sell again."
"9936120","9941340"," So it's kind of fascinating to, uh, uh, to follow him. "
"9941500","9943640"," So Victor Nederhopper, he's on the fin to it."
"9944220","9946740"," He's, he's really, he's got, I guess he says he's getting old."
"9946900","9947540"," I don't believe that. "
"9947740","9951340"," He's, he said he didn't sleep one day last week for like 24 hours."
"9951360","9954700"," He's like, I watched the markets for like 24 hours the other day."
"9954700","9955780"," And I was like, I bet he fucking did. "
"9955920","9957380"," I was like, he's fucking, you get older."
"9957500","9958440"," You don't need as much sleep."
"9958700","9961540"," So you're like, then you put there. "
"9961560","9963080"," They're like, I'm too old to trade the market."
"9963080","9965960"," And I'm like, this fucking guy is probably watching the market all day long."
"9966920","9969060"," Probably fucking smarter than fucking three quarters. "
"9969220","9969980"," 90% of us."
"9971320","9974900"," And he's like rambling on and like, uh, about the markets."
"9974900","9980400"," And I'm like, this fucking guy is giving more alpha than most people out there. "
"9980560","9986780"," I think on, I think on February 21st, two days ago, he was like, two days ago, he made a"
"9986780","9987880"," note on fin to it."
"9987920","9989940"," And he's like, yeah, we're coming into the bottom here."
"9990820","9992180"," He's like, it's been 20 days. "
"9992840","9993660"," Prices are low."
"9993960","9995500"," And I was like, oh, this dude's watching."
"9996500","9997980"," I'm like, this fucking guy knows. "
"10000040","10001600"," So that was kind of fascinating to see."
"10004410","10008610"," So if you find him on fin to it, there's Victor Nederhopper, yeah, old school."
"10010110","10011950"," All the old traders know who he is, investors. "
"10013850","10014970"," He's kind of legendary."
"10018950","10022890"," But if a young trader or young investor never heard of him, check him out."
"10024350","10025770"," I've got his book over here. "
"10028420","10030560"," This is the education of a speculator."
"10031780","10034460"," This was actually recommended to me by a ball whiz."
"10034880","10044220"," And it's funny because a ball whiz had said to me, don't read it all in one sitting. "
"10045440","10048400"," And I was like, what do you mean don't read it all in one sitting?"

"10094730","10096850"," And he discusses insights."
"10097730","10101150"," He doesn't talk directly about functions of the market, but he talks."
"10103150","10106770"," I don't know if you have a liberal arts background or something, how to relate markets. "
"10109800","10112320"," Now trade in 85 cents, 86 cents."

"10692490","10692610"," Sure. "
"10693350","10696630"," Don't fucking come to me and try to say you're going to be in the stock market and not take"
"10696630","10697070"," on risk."
"10698410","10698750"," Right?"
"10698970","10702270"," Don't be like, oh, I'm getting in the stock market here and I want no risk wins every time."
"10702850","10704250"," I see these guys unfintuit. "
"10704410","10704930"," They never lose."
"10706730","10708610"," That is best traders out there."
"10708630","10711170"," I'm like, these fucking guys are lying to you. "
"10711190","10711890"," Don't realize that."
"10713130","10715770"," I don't realize people are lying to you out there."
"10716610","10718070"," Motherfuckers always have a perfect trade. "
"10718810","10720610"," Motherfuckers call for crashes every day of the week."

"10732070","10732510"," Do you see it?"
"10733150","10734810"," Nice bullish cross, right?"
"10736470","10737970"," Bullish cross over trigger. "

"10740930","10741950"," Price target above."
"10745220","10748080"," Don't forget, you've got this PT1 above over here. "
"10749180","10751980"," You have to be very, I think we already tagged the PT1, right?"
"10752140","10752960"," I think we already did this one."
"10754100","10755980"," What we'll do is we'll make this now PT1."
"10756300","10758160"," This is the pivot point up here. "
"10758800","10762600"," You should see a little bit of volatility in there, but I want that right there, man."
"10762720","10763300"," I want that 424."
"10765400","10770940"," And I'd like to see an unwind on, I'd like to see an unwind into Friday, personally. "
"10772020","10774400"," So I'd like to see us unwind a little bit into Friday."
"10779600","10780920"," Unclench into Friday."
"10781380","10781760"," All this bearishness. "
"10785550","10786250"," Maybe we don't."
"10786350","10787650"," Maybe they sell the fuck out of this market in Friday."
"10787650","10788050"," I don't know. "
"10788690","10793950"," I know that February, end of February is typically one of the shittiest times of the year."
"10794690","10796510"," So you get that working against you as a bull."
"10798270","10799850"," I'm not ready to buy anything. "
"10801650","10804150"," You guys already know that I'm not willing to buy any stock here."
"10805510","10808210"," I'm looking for a lower low to buy stock for the springtime."
"10809030","10815090"," I'm looking for like $65 on Tesla, $95 on Tesla. "
"10816710","10818030"," Or I'm looking to buy above."
"10818830","10823570"," Like right now it's out of 220, but it could come down to like 286 if the market goes down"
"10823570","10823970"," a little bit."
"10824950","10827910"," So I've got some moving targets above for Tesla. "
"10828970","10832050"," And then I've got some stable targets below for Tesla."
"10838880","10840920"," My stops are going to be way down here."

"10983340","10985860"," And it's because it was going through stream labs."
"10986380","10990040"," So if you do like a direct PayPal tip, I see that money. "
"10990860","10992740"," But I didn't know where all this fucking money is."

"11034810","11035830"," So like it's really weird."
"11036030","11038570"," Like YouTube does the same thing."
"11038710","11040370"," YouTube is like YouTube advertising. "
"11041330","11042890"," That shit's like a month out or something."
"11043790","11045690"," So if you look inside the description, right?"
"11045690","11047870"," You'll see two types, two ways to donate."
"11048450","11051290"," There's like the stream labs and then there's just PayPal. "
"11051990","11052350"," PayPal."
"11052650","11053030"," It's like boom."

"11054230","11055930"," Uh, stream labs though."
"11056090","11057410"," They're like, they're like, fuck no, dude."
"11057550","11058830"," We're going to make some money off your money. "
"11059630","11061890"," They're like, we're going to, we're going to fucking invest this."
"11062070","11063870"," We're going to put it in the bank and make six percent."
"11065170","11066810"," So five, five and a half percent. "
"11067770","11068810"," We're holding that shit."
"11071710","11074950"," And it's funny too, as I read about it this week, I was like, Oh, what?"
"11074950","11076410"," I was like, why is this all being held?"
"11077350","11079250"," And they were like, well, it's because of refunds."
"11079550","11080750"," And I was like, bullshit. "
"11082010","11087590"," It was like the reason is because you're making our five and a half percent on it."
"11090840","11091960"," That's the reason."
"11097110","11098050"," Oh, thanks Dustin. "
"11098350","11098610"," Yeah, man."
"11099130","11099730"," Dm way."
"11100110","11100870"," I appreciate it. "
"11101590","11104250"," I thought I had a, I thought I had a Venmo link inside the description."

"11107530","11108690"," Yeah, no worries, man. "
"11109310","11109970"," I appreciate it."
"11113770","11114510"," Yeah, I leave."
"11114910","11116810"," They do charge back donations, but. "

"11121430","11122470"," don't take the money out of PayPal."
"11122570","11123390"," I'll just leave it there."

"11124850","11125130"," So."
"11126330","11127270"," But it is there."
"11128190","11131410"," You know, the fact if I needed to take it out, I was like, Oh, man, I got a car"

"11155500","11157720"," Remember I was having problems with PayPal too. "
"11158600","11159920"," I had a dude."

"11327720","11328840"," And I look this up."
"11329820","11331520"," And people are like all over the internet. "
"11331520","11332540"," They're like, you're totally fucked."
"11333160","11334120"," Like your money is gone."
"11335820","11336640"," They're like the crazy. "
"11336980","11338700"," The only thing you can do is refund people."
"11342260","11343580"," They're like YouTube or not YouTube."
"11343920","11345480"," PayPal will try to keep this money. "
"11347020","11349900"," And not even refund it to the people that donated it to you."
"11350020","11350480"," I was like, what?"
"11351160","11352200"," They're like, yeah, they're like."
"11352200","11354940"," They're like, they're like, you have a time. "
"11355160","11359900"," They're like, you have a window where you can refund it before they freeze it even further."
"11360680","11364300"," So they're like, you have like three days where you can start making refunds to people."
"11364860","11370360"," And if you don't within the three days, you can't even refund people at that point. "
"11372650","11374370"," And so I like freak out and panic."
"11375250","11376790"," And so I contact YouTube."
"11377070","11380530"," But of course, I'm not YouTube PayPal people are like, there's no way they're talking to you. "
"11381150","11382830"," They're like, there's no fucking way, man."
"11382830","11385830"," It's like getting someone at YouTube to contact you."
"11386270","11388310"," Like you contact YouTube and they never respond. "
"11388550","11389490"," It's just automated shit."
"11394340","11395700"," And so I'm looking at my calls right now."
"11398370","11399830"," So they're like, so there. "
"11400010","11405210"," So I reach out to them and I try to do refunds and I can't do refunds."
"11406750","11410410"," I think I got a few refunds out there, but a whole bunch of them I couldn't do."
"11411190","11414730"," So I contact PayPal and I'm like, hey, man, what's going on?"
"11415410","11417850"," And this lady is like, here's the deal. "
"11419490","11421790"," She's like, you can't do a live stream."

"11429130","11429910"," And I'm like, what do you mean?"
"11430090","11433310"," She's like, you have to have like a transaction."
"11435750","11439050"," Where you provide something they pay for it."
"11439390","11447410"," That was my first experience that all of this is constructed to make money. "
"11448790","11452110"," You're so you're basically if you start out where you have good intent."
"11453430","11457310"," You're eventually forced into a pay for subscription service."
"11457930","11459330"," So that's where it starts. "
"11460110","11462750"," So then they're like, you have to have some kind of transaction."
"11463350","11465070"," I'm like, I'm like, no, no, no."
"11467950","11469570"," I want to say I'm watching my calls here. "

"11521060","11521780"," Let's see if we can get it."
"11526400","11530300"," So it's constructed for you where you you're a subscriber."
"11530920","11531040"," Right. "
"11531320","11531920"," That was what I was told."

"11564340","11564960"," Just squeezing."
"11566640","11572340"," Squeezing through punching up through that yellow with my back strap."
"11573250","11582100"," So then like if you sign up with stream labs, you can then have a separate link for donations and"
"11582100","11582540"," like, okay. "
"11583040","11586980"," So I sign up for stream labs, but this is the thing is that they want you to like."

"11620780","11622760"," They want to own your content for 24 hours."

"12076020","12076680"," You guys know, right?"
"12079000","12081760"," We just have this conversation about Victor."

"12085760","12087560"," When everybody's buying, you're selling. "
"12087820","12088100"," You get it?"
"12088980","12089760"," You can go up here."
"12091160","12092440"," I understand we're going up there."
"12093400","12094680"," I know we're getting up there. "
"12094680","12095440"," Well, not me."
"12095520","12095920"," Not that high."
"12096060","12096460"," It's 450. "
"12098440","12100000"," It looks somewhere like right here."
"12104340","12105550"," Congrats to fucking Lations."

"12134540","12135160"," Bullish. "
"12138960","12140260"," What's this right here?"
"12142500","12143800"," Bearish, right?"
"12147000","12148880"," What happens when you see?"
"12150480","12153240"," The lines go curving, right?"
"12153620","12154620"," See the lines curving?"
"12154980","12156460"," Reversal time, right?"
"12157400","12159440"," Some confirmation for a move higher, right?"
"12161780","12162600"," Whoo!"
"12164520","12165700"," Hell's yes."
"12181490","12183180"," Yeah, I'm not classy."
"12187490","12189150"," I love that pun, David. "
"12189310","12189610"," That was good."
"12196180","12203400"," They change every day, but the one that's pretty consistent here is the 21 or 27 EMA."
"12204300","12206860"," You do your own, like, whatever you want somewhere in there. "
"12207160","12208040"," Some people do the 20."
"12211160","12216780"," Then over here, this one ranges from the 200 to the 112-ish somewhere in there, depending on the"
"12216780","12218100"," day, because they're not really EMA's."
"12220120","12227040"," But I try to put them on an EMA so that you guys will have some kind of ability to"
"12227040","12232140"," trade this until you get the tool. "
"12237900","12238980"," Yeah, it depends on the day."
"12240320","12241920"," You guys are getting a cool-ass tool, though."
"12242000","12247800"," You guys are getting a tool that's like bullish clusters, bearish clusters, enter, exit, all that"
"12247800","12248200"," kind of shit. "
"12248320","12248720"," It's gonna be badass."
"12252950","12254990"," You guys don't worry, we get some shit coming your way."
"12254990","12256470"," Just be patient. "
"12256870","12258930"," We're down to two weeks or down."
"12259130","12266330"," We have three months as the latest timeframes, so we're like two and a half months now away."
"12267170","12269410"," We're coming into the second week, I think. "
"12271310","12273790"," So we're just passing the time, man."
"12274150","12283650"," We have a guy who is an artificial intelligence developer"
"12284190","12286950"," for a big tech company, very well known."

"12305830","12306790"," And I'm like, I am dumb."
"12308430","12309850"," I'm like, Grog needs, though. "
"12312780","12313980"," Please help Grog."
"12315720","12317360"," Grog has many friends."
"12319720","12325920"," Grog's friends need, or need, or need a simple crayon. "
"12327720","12329480"," Grog and friends like simple."
"12332910","12334730"," Please help Grog and friends."
"12336250","12338650"," And he's taking a shine to Grog and friends. "
"12339390","12340750"," He's like, I feel bad for you."
"12341230","12342930"," He's like, you guys are so stupid."
"12345390","12346230"," I'll help. "
"12346230","12348090"," I'm like, thank you."
"12349290","12350350"," Grog, very thanks."
"12350610","12351070"," Thank you. "
"12353570","12357270"," Captain Grog and friends say thank you."
"12361390","12362510"," I do that with Winky."
"12363650","12364830"," That's how I talk to Winky. "
"12365030","12367230"," I'm like, look, I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here, man."
"12368430","12369630"," I am so stupid."
"12372090","12373670"," I'm like, please, I'm begging you. "
"12374350","12376010"," And Winky dude is doing banging stuff."
"12377070","12378050"," We got Chas."
"12378270","12378870"," Dude, we got Blinky. "
"12379950","12381210"," We got all kinds of cool guys."
"12384080","12385000"," We got Joe Harper."
"12386140","12389280"," We got people that are just like, we got your wife's boyfriend. "
"12390820","12394320"," I'm like, your wife's boyfriend is like in a discord all by himself."
"12394560","12396460"," I'm like, I know that it's hard."
"12396780","12398000"," I realize it's difficult. "
"12400620","12400760"," You know?"
"12401320","12402760"," I'm like, just hang on."
"12402980","12403200"," I'm coming."
"12403440","12403820"," I promise. "

"12407240","12408560"," I love you."
"12419430","12421550"," Yeah, it's very similar to the big green line. "
"12421810","12422530"," It's actually just."
"12424950","12426550"," It's the big green line."
"12426650","12430710"," It's like the, it's an extension of big green line, but it's on. "
"12432730","12433890"," Higher time frames."
"12434790","12435310"," So."
"12436250","12439230"," There's like a surface market and a hidden market. "
"12439590","12444710"," And so trying to show you the hidden market with the, with the market that shows itself to you."
"12444710","12445830"," The one that you see."
"12446290","12447750"," And there's a, there's a hidden market. "
"12448070","12448790"," So we're trying to show that to you."
"12448850","12450730"," And then we're trying to show you a fractal."
"12452810","12453530"," Elliott waves. "
"12454090","12454890"," Elliott wave fractals."
"12455830","12456270"," Velocity momentum."
"12456670","12457110"," That kind of stuff. "
"12458190","12459250"," Well, bearish and bullish."
"12463880","12464500"," That's not useless."
"12465880","12467080"," Fucking smarter than me, man. "
"12469360","12470160"," Much smarter than me."
"12480830","12481750"," Yeah, I like fractals."
"12483130","12485810"," So I did a, I did a concept for. "
"12486990","12489010"," I've got a, I've got an Elliott wave."
"12491010","12496410"," Ledger book that I designed last night for the, an Elliott wave ledger book."
"12498210","12499430"," For the, for the store. "
"12500390","12501590"," Wait till you see that one."
"12504480","12505680"," I'm not going to tell you what it is."
"12505860","12507840"," But when you see it, you're going to be like, this is awesome. "
"12509180","12512680"," Especially if you're not a wave practitioner, you know, you'll like, I think you'll like it."
"12518400","12519780"," So I want to show you something here."
"12519880","12520040"," Okay. "
"12522770","12524290"," We're getting very bullish here."
"12525250","12526770"," More bullish than you think."
"12526770","12527210"," Okay. "
"12530550","12531930"," This is momentum."
"12532390","12532590"," Okay."
"12534030","12535010"," This is velocity. "
"12540770","12542690"," So I want you to see this here."
"12542970","12548190"," If you, if you ever look at a EMAs and stuff, you'll see the, the math behind is based upon"
"12548190","12549330"," triggers and stuff like that."
"12551070","12552250"," So just in here. "
"12555580","12555940"," Right."
"12556080","12556720"," Came down here."
"12556920","12557500"," Let me get rid of this. "
"12557680","12558900"," This yellow line over here."
"12563000","12564240"," Just plain as day."
"12564360","12564520"," Okay. "
"12564620","12565280"," That I want you to see."
"12570900","12571680"," So what is it?"
"12571820","12575240"," What's, what are you being told in the background here that you can't see in price?"
"12577460","12582340"," And the, you can't see in the, on the, on the, like if you're just looking at the, at, like"
"12582340","12584680"," the, how the fucking stock is trading here."
"12584740","12586060"," You can't really tell what's going on, right?"
"12587820","12589640"," What you can see in the background is this. "
"12591040","12595760"," You can see negative momentum is leaving."
"12597120","12597140"," Okay."
"12599160","12605820"," And it's implying here that we're going to get positive momentum at some point. "
"12606600","12607140"," Okay."
"12608020","12609620"," We want this to grow on the hourly."
"12609980","12610160"," Okay. "
"12611880","12615340"," So if we're, if we're, if we're trying to be predictive, right."
"12617680","12619860"," What is, what is our thought process here, right?"
"12620300","12624020"," We're getting lower prices, but momentum is turning positive."
"12624900","12627380"," So we're not seeing momentum turn negative, right?"
"12627480","12630080"," We're not seeing like momentum growing down here, are we?"
"12631320","12631590"," Right. "

"12634720","12637220"," But we're not seeing momentum grow to the downside, right?"
"12637960","12639600"," So this is being predictive to you."
"12639700","12644980"," What it's telling you is that is this level right here, is this really resistant?"
"12644980","12645680"," Or not?"
"12645880","12652120"," I'm going to tell you that right now it's not resistance because we're predicting ahead of time"
"12652120","12657620"," that bears are losing the downward momentum, even though price is showing lower that we're likely"
"12657620","12660200"," going to break through and trade higher. "

"13408440","13413440"," We're going to be able to put alerts on every ticker you want, like a hundred tickers. "
"13414860","13421780"," So if like UNG's popping one day, if Apple's popping one day, if NVIDIA is popping one day, if the"

"13515600","13523460"," Just pumping, coming into for tomorrow, Friday, and you've got beast mode underneath Tesla. "
"13527720","13528620"," Tesla's looking good."
"13528740","13529580"," I'll be honest with you."
"13529940","13531100"," I'll be honest with you right now. "
"13531140","13539240"," If I was on Fintuit right now, not a thousand Fintuit right now, I'll be honest, I'd probably start"
"13539240","13540600"," and I'll make some predictions here."
"13547860","13552040"," Probably predicting a move to 220,000 Fintuit right now."
"13556510","13557450"," That's what I'd be doing. "
"13557730","13558110"," Where's Friday?"

"13616830","13620650"," You've got a yellow box down here, but truthfully, it's probably a buy right here. "
"13622270","13629310"," And you need price to stay above that one minute, but I would expect some consolidation down here."
"13629430","13630710"," So that smells really good."
"13630850","13631470"," It's chilly, dude. "
"13631590","13632670"," They made they chilly."

"13654650","13656350"," Gotta be honest, right up there. "
"13658890","13660530"," We'll chart it out and see if it works."
"13660530","13670370"," We'll come back to this to to then right there."
"13677120","13677520"," Done. "
"13684100","13686460"," Now, let's see if anything else is lining up with this stuff."
"13686620","13687320"," We're going to look at Apple."
"13687580","13688820"," We're going to look at HYG. "
"13691280","13693500"," We're going to make sure that we're not get crazy here."
"13693720","13694960"," We'll look at Bix real quick too."
"13697060","13698800"," Let's look at let's look up first. "
"13700340","13701900"," See if we see if we're crazy here."
"13702140","13703000"," Nope, we're not crazy."
"13705920","13706360"," Nope. "
"13707260","13709220"," Oh, dude, Apple's dude."
"13711160","13713220"," Dude, come on."
"13713800","13717560"," I don't you have to measure this to find out where this goes, but dude, look at this. "
"13717960","13721340"," If you're a bear, I'm gonna mourn you right now."
"13721460","13722540"," Get the fuck out of the way."
"13725460","13726540"," Get out of the way. "
"13728200","13728560"," 156."
"13729020","13729520"," I'm serious."
"13730100","13730540"," Get out of the way. "
"13730680","13733260"," I'm gonna check something in the background and see if I'm wrong on this."
"13734920","13736920"," Be very careful here if you're a bear."
"13739140","13740260"," Apple's super fucking bullish. "
"13742160","13743720"," We'll look at some other things and see."
"13744400","13746060"," I don't know why we're looking so bullish here right now."
"13747720","13749920"," Oh, that's HYG. "
"13752860","13755680"," HYG's bullish to 75 bucks."
"13760570","13762450"," Maybe we don't get to 220."
"13764550","13765350"," How about this?"
"13766790","13773670"," Watch HYG to 75 flat, okay?"
"13774630","13783310"," Maybe trade it as a pair with trade it as a pair with spy and trade it as a pair"
"13783310","13784830"," with Tesla and Apple. "
"13785210","13789770"," Maybe there is some limited upside to the market here."
"13794180","13795480"," Let's talk about the VIX."
"13803130","13804530"," VIX still bears right here. "
"13804650","13806410"," You guys a little bit, there's a little bit more upside here in the market."
"13808130","13811910"," VIX, you're looking for 2029 somewhere in here."
"13813050","13814470"," You can triple trade this. "
"13814650","13816290"," Get yourself a screener."
"13817730","13820210"," Three screeners, I guess, maybe four."
"13820350","13823030"," You need a trading platform or whatever. "
"13824490","13825870"," Thank you, Rando."
"13829240","13836060"," Price target down below on VIX, 2055, 2033."
"13853180","13857200"," Yeah, the VIX can go to 46 minus 46. "
"13857720","13864080"," So yeah, I'm actually quite bullish here overall."
"13864420","13866060"," Like market overall, I'm bullish here."
"13868260","13874240"," So what am I looking for here on spy is that consolidation, right?"
"13875580","13876820"," I want to see that consolidation. "
"13876820","13878900"," I want to see momentum come up higher."
"13880000","13885020"," I don't want to see the spy go below the minute."
"13885680","13887480"," It says we're losing velocity if it does. "
"13888900","13892720"," But truthfully, I want to see us come back and check this five minutes."
"13893040","13895920"," So we'll take a look in the five minute chart and spy as well."
"13897280","13901760"," Some probably down here somewhere down in here waiting for this to come down. "
"13902220","13904760"," Probably want to see like spy just come down if I can."
"13905260","13908760"," I'm probably being greedy here, but for that move higher, that's what I'm looking for, something"
"13908760","13909220"," like that."
"13911180","13913360"," We'll look at a five minute chart if we even get down there. "
"13915160","13916820"," That's where my buy is here right there."
"13917620","13918740"," Maybe it's slightly higher."
"13920940","13922740"," We're seeing a trend reversal here. "
"13922920","13925820"," I want you to see this for just a five minute chart."
"13926880","13931100"," I want you to see a trend reversal as if it takes place, if it happens what you're looking for."
"13931620","13937120"," So you see this selling big selling came down here, red over white, price under white, right?"
"13937500","13938680"," Price, this is the BGL. "
"13938920","13940100"," I think this is what Jade Marcus does."
"13940840","13943500"," So this is a price under the white line."
"13944760","13947220"," Then we have the, that's below the red line. "
"13947440","13948860"," You see this cross happening right here."
"13949680","13952280"," So what you're looking for, this isn't a Friday, right?"
"13952480","13953740"," So you guys are getting ready for Friday."
"13955260","13959160"," You want to see the white line come up and you want to see the red line get underneath and"
"13959160","13967530"," you want to see price stay above. "
"13968230","13969590"," So this is where you put stops in, right?"
"13969830","13970270"," You're like, okay."
"13970850","13974250"," All right, cap thinking about one dates for tomorrow here, captain."
"13976880","13978500"," What am I looking for here, cap?"
"13979860","13980760"," What's the plan?"
"13980960","13981800"," What time is it right now?"
"13982040","13990400"," 2.53. You guys tune in every night to your YouTube show that you watch every night. "
"13991400","13993600"," So here's your first YouTube show for tomorrow."
"13995460","13996540"," You ready for it?"
"13999370","14005760"," As long as price stays above, 3.99, 18."
"14015120","14017920"," As long as price stays above, 3.99, 18. "
"14021080","14025700"," There is a buy here for Friday."
"14027500","14032040"," Price target above at least 404, at least."
"14037720","14039440"," You want to see what I want to see above?"
"14041500","14046780"," 4.08. This is Valhalla right here. "
"14048720","14049600"," Right there."
"14054240","14056100"," This is your red line right here."
"14060630","14062070"," That's what I want to see, baby. "
"14063450","14073430"," If we break 3.99, I mean, break, not just"
"14073430","14077730"," tuck, not stick a no bears want to know if we crash."
"14077990","14078790"," I know they think we're crashing."
"14081250","14087070"," 3.95.02. So if you're a bear and you're like, yeah, we're going down cap. "
"14087210","14087670"," You don't get crazy."
"14090210","14093250"," 3.95.02 right here."
"14105460","14106420"," This is into Friday. "
"14108860","14111780"," Lower price target, 3.95.02 in the Friday close."
"14112540","14116520"," If things get crazy momentum can't, we don't stay above momentum, all that kind of stuff."
"14117320","14119900"," 3.95.02 in the close on Friday. "
"14120900","14122200"," But there's a dip to buy down here."
"14122340","14123340"," So there's a dip buy right here."
"14124360","14125140"," It's right here. "
"14126780","14129400"," I'm looking, I'm telling you what I'm looking for in the Friday."

"14163540","14165600"," Whoo, say it's some chili, baby."
"14167080","14168240"," And they got cornbread."
"14171460","14173500"," That's what I'm looking for right there, baby, right there. "
"14174840","14177200"," And I'm, and you know what I'm looking for for next week?"
"14178940","14183380"," I'm looking for a for a sell down for next week into the bloodbath for end of February."
"14184960","14186180"," I don't think we're getting it though."
"14186320","14189740"," They were going up and kiss off on February second. "
"14195580","14198220"," That's my private, that's my private take."
"14198380","14199120"," I don't want to share that publicly."

"14316300","14317300"," Too much time, man."
"14318220","14318840"," I disagree."
"14319480","14322220"," So if we hold, you ready for this?"
"14322700","14329240"," If we hold above 404 because too much time has passed, it was 408 yesterday. "
"14329600","14329920"," So 404."
"14332820","14334320"," We will have a trend change."
"14334760","14336560"," I want you to see this here. "
"14336680","14340300"," This is a very bearish, very bearish cross right here."
"14341600","14348880"," But if you're a bull, you want some kind of like, hey, man, I'm not on this bearish cross right"
"14348880","14349140"," here."

"14360400","14361800"," There's your bear trade over."
"14363060","14365260"," So maybe you don't want to be caught dead in here. "
"14366920","14368560"," This is very dangerous up in here."
"14370700","14375380"," Matter of fact, we'll just put a, we'll just put a, this way the bears will step in and be"
"14375380","14377020"," like, yeah, bro, you want to go to 404?"

"14378860","14380600"," It's an automatic short up there. "
"14381860","14383800"," That's what they're telling themselves right now."
"14383880","14385200"," They're like, this is an automatic short up here, bro."
"14385620","14386900"," I double dog dare you. "
"14388820","14390060"," That's what they're saying right now."

"14455640","14456760"," There's an automatic short above."
"14457220","14462160"," That means that if you're a bull, you're going to take your money and run at 400 before we get"
"14462160","14462420"," there."
"14463120","14467920"," If you're a bear, you want to be selling 400 and 400. "
"14468040","14469380"," Excuse me, I said 400, but it's 404."
"14470420","14473420"," You want to be selling 404 and then have a stops above."
"14477060","14477420"," Bull's. "

"14486930","14490270"," I'm going to let the columnist here. "
"14491870","14493030"," I'll mute that right there."
"14495770","14497190"," There's an automatic short right here."
"14497350","14497750"," Guaranteed. "
"14498330","14499190"," I'll guarantee it."
"14499330","14500290"," There's an automatic short right here."
"14502030","14504230"," If you're a bull, you're going to be like this. "
"14505050","14507790"," I'm long to 404 or 404."
"14508470","14512770"," If you're a bear, you're going to be like, yep, I'm taking over."
"14512950","14517670"," We're going to clock out at the at the at work, I'm clocking out of the bowl. "
"14517870","14518170"," You're there."
"14518270","14518870"," You're clocking in."
"14519990","14523550"," Now, if the if the bears are like, oh, shit, we're getting over run here. "
"14523550","14526210"," You're going to have stops above, right?"
"14527790","14530470"," Because if the bulls are like, oh, these we don't have any scholars here, bro."
"14532170","14532650"," Excuse me."
"14533930","14538250"," If you see consolidation up here and start pushing up higher, this is where the bulls step back in"
"14538250","14541970"," and they're going to go for higher than four, right?"
"14542730","14543470"," There'll be a trend change. "
"14543470","14545970"," You're going to see 408, 420, probably 430."
"14546670","14547410"," I'm honest with you."
"14548070","14549830"," 430 be the next attack for the bulls. "
"14550910","14552510"," It's a pretty important place right here, right?"
"14557610","14563570"," This would be a fundamental four-hour, one-hour trend change on the S&P 500."
"14564050","14565530"," So we're all talking about a crash yesterday, right?"
"14566330","14580980"," And this morning, yeah,"
"14581100","14582080"," I make some of my numbers here."
"14582560","14583820"," It's 404, apologize. "
"14590560","14592780"," This makes for a really nice spread, doesn't it?"
"14594300","14596440"," 400c, expiring tomorrow."
"14599020","14601300"," They pull some bullshit down here with you."
"14602780","14604440"," They roll it over a little bit. "
"14605420","14607320"," You get 400c's for tomorrow."
"14608220","14609800"," They sell it down on the clothes."
"14610180","14611940"," They do some funky finagling down here. "
"14615300","14620400"," I bet you like a 398, 396c for tomorrow's kind of safe."
"14622840","14625260"," But you'd have to cut that shit short if you get up here."
"14626400","14627740"," You have to take your money and run. "
"14647390","14648450"," Just be wary up here."
"14655740","14657360"," Sorry, I'm trying to eat while I talk to you guys."
"14657440","14658060"," Give me one second here. "
"14675530","14676910"," They're like, no, fuck this, Cap."
"14677030","14678250"," We're just going to 404 right now."
"14678290","14678870"," We're not even waiting. "
"14689480","14691780"," We're just going to ride this bitch right to 404 in the clothes."
"14699260","14702560"," You can pause the program and go right, but you can just pause the program."
"14702680","14703420"," Go back 10 minutes. "
"14707710","14709970"," You just go back 10 minutes in this broadcast."
"14710450","14712750"," I'll give you my exact price target today and tomorrow."
"14712750","14714450"," Even give some trade suggestions. "
"14715750","14718570"," If you're a bear, I got you covered."
"14720030","14721410"," You know what you're looking for."
"14721990","14729110"," If you're a bull and you take profit above, you know exactly where you know exactly what you should"
"14729110","14729890"," be doing here, right?"
"14730110","14731510"," It's been pretty simple from this point forward. "

"14968330","14974130"," We touch this white line and we hold this white line or we should be off and running here."
"14974790","14977430"," As long as we don't trade underneath it, it should be good to go."
"14982110","14986430"," All right. "

"15145560","15146940"," Those are very risky trade."
"15148040","15155310"," But even so, I'll roll it into a trade for tomorrow. "

"15785680","15786780"," I know some people really adore them."
"15787300","15788680"," Some people culturally use them. "
"15790240","15795560"," Oftentimes precious metals, precious stones are a way to protect wealth for people."
"15796080","15796660"," Sorry, I specked all that."
"15796660","15801660"," That dowries are common in some cultures. "
"15808320","15811400"," So I get the idea behind having nice stuff."
"15818320","15825560"," You get some guys like, you get some guys like, I'm an engineer and we didn't buy expensive rings."
"15825560","15826580"," And I'm like, what's on your wrist?"
"15827420","15828620"," Because they go, that's an apple I watch. "
"15829580","15830720"," Sport edition or something."
"15832040","15832960"," And what's that thing cost?"
"15833340","15835140"," That is throw away tech right there, 800 bucks."
"15836300","15836740"," Okay. "
"15850330","15852850"," Yeah, I was looking at the Captain Willard watch."
"15853290","15856030"," I was thinking about getting one, but I don't want to get it ripped off my hand or anything."
"15858670","15860570"," I was thinking about picking up a Captain Willard watch. "
"15864420","15865500"," I used to have a Rolex."
"15866240","15867260"," I wasn't happy with it."
"15869100","15870600"," Oh, I like, I like Rolex. "
"15870780","15871600"," I like the look of it, of course."
"15872120","15873180"," I didn't like wearing it publicly."
"15875660","15876780"," It wasn't a fan of it. "
"15877520","15879760"," You know what else is like that, uh, our Terricks."
"15880680","15882140"," I don't wear our Terricks either."
"15882300","15883820"," There's somebody, some stuff I don't wear publicly. "
"15884640","15885620"," I feel like I get judged."
"15888240","15889680"," So I don't bother with some of that stuff."
"15890180","15893280"," I like the, I like the Captain Willard watch, if you guys know what that is. "
"15896970","15898610"," But I don't actually like the Seiko."
"15899090","15902530"," There's a few other watchmakers that are making similar watches to it."
"15902610","15903430"," I like the style of it. "
"15906380","15910120"," But I like the idea of a dive watch that's not really a technical dive watch."
"15911460","15912820"," Now trading 46 cents."
"15912820","15913960"," They're going to try to burn this shit off. "
"15914200","15915640"," We might trade sideways in the close."
"15915920","15916440"," Be careful here."
"15917360","15919100"," We are slowing down on a momentum here. "
"15919780","15922100"," If we get one more bounce here, it might take the money and run."
"15923220","15925220"," Trading 43 cents, 44 cents."
"15925420","15926720"," I'm going to give this one more try here. "
"15927240","15928860"," Just be warned if you're long right now."
"15929560","15932120"," We're kind of, we're not rolling over, but we are trading sideways."
"15932580","15935740"," There could be a possibility that we trade sideways in the bell. "
"15935980","15937020"," I'm up right now in this trade."
"15938420","15939760"," But I want to see this run up."
"15939940","15941780"," I don't know if it takes into the bell to do it. "
"15942820","15944600"," I don't want to get torched in my calls either."
"15946740","15948660"," We don't have a lot of time here is my point."
"15950890","15955010"," So I'm looking for like as time passes, we can go up here. "
"15955310","15958290"," But my calls might be like, yeah, I'm directionally right here."

"17127660","17129540"," Just in market breath right now."
"17130240","17132760"," Like even if this is bottom I don't think that it is. "
"17133180","17138500"," If this is bottom I don't mean like the bottom of the market."
"17138580","17142480"," I mean bottom of this down cycle."
"17142740","17143680"," I don't think that it is. "
"17144360","17146160"," Market breath indicator says it's not."
"17147120","17154020"," But you know if you're looking for money to trade the easiest trade you can take is a call spread"
"17154020","17155440"," on very oversold conditions."
"17156240","17160660"," You only need to take those like well right now in a bear market they're like seven times a year. "
"17161180","17163920"," But in a bull market they're every month every 20 days."
"17165020","17170460"," It's like clockwork baby boom boom boom bear market."
"17171380","17175400"," You may have to wait every two months but there there is a time for oversold. "
"17175660","17177000"," We're close to it right now."
"17177840","17184020"," I don't know if you know that or not but we're very close to having a buyable bottom like one"
"17184020","17186480"," thing you're like we're fucking definitely not going down anymore."
"17187140","17189120"," Now sometimes we'll bounce here and keep going higher. "
"17189860","17191680"," We'll like get 430 or some shit like that."
"17191860","17192260"," We'll miss it."
"17193260","17198700"," Bear markets it's more difficult to find them but if you get one there are no brainers. "
"17199580","17203420"," So they have the bears sell so above here right and this is not an extra right here right."
"17205180","17210840"," If the bears are able to sell this down we can get this last capitulation for bulls you have one"
"17210840","17212660"," more leg down believe it or not that wasn't the leg."
"17212860","17218840"," But if you can get one more here or at least trade sideways I was talking to I think Matthew"
"17218840","17222740"," last night or something or no it was on captain's alpha I think. "
"17223000","17229680"," Yeah it was Matthew or it was somebody and I said to them captain's alpha I said the last or"
"17229680","17234720"," the people last night because alpha I said you know it's setting up here as I said you know what's"
"17234720","17235500"," really worried about this."

"17240860","17242720"," like I gotta get this shit out in case I'm off the internet."
"17244040","17250260"," But I'm like so this is what I was positing last night was I was like I was like I"
"17250260","17255420"," personally I don't think this is bottom but we're not getting price acceleration so it's not gonna"
"17255420","17259200"," be one that captain's alpha last night I'm like you know what it is looking like it's looking like"
"17259200","17268140"," that shit right there it's looking like I'm serious I'm like it's looking like"
