"93670","94070"," Okay."
"95890","96910"," How y'all doing out there?"
"97110","97930"," Everybody's joining us right now. "
"99350","100290"," Give me a second here."
"103090","103750"," All right."
"108650","109590"," Just a second here. "
"114690","115430"," All right."
"115630","118280"," All right."
"118400","119500"," Let's see what's going on here this morning. "
"120040","120620"," Welcome back."
"120760","120980"," It's Monday."
"121700","124020"," I was trying to be here before the open. "
"124540","129560"," This morning, I was hoping I could get back to spend an hour or so with you before Monday morning"
"129560","131240"," for the open this morning, believe it or not."
"133480","134900"," And I didn't get that chance."
"135400","137400"," We're looking at Tesla right now, not spy. "
"137780","138860"," We can look at spy if you'd like."
"140640","143820"," We are extremely well."
"144580","145520"," Hold on a second here. "
"146340","148600"," We are extremely bullish right now."
"151460","155100"," We're going to talk about the weekend the last week."
"155920","157860"," You should have been able to have seen. "
"159800","160640"," Hold on here."
"161140","163560"," Let me make sure we don't get any of those Russian hookers in here."
"167660","168140"," Okay. "
"170280","174480"," Now, just briefly, I want you to see."
"175140","178660"," I hope I'm not something weird going on my mic this morning."
"179860","181100"," Hang tight here for a second. "
"181320","182320"," Check one to check."
"182900","184440"," Get some weirdness going on my mic."
"185180","185620"," Okay. "
"185920","185940"," So."
"190310","191490"," I do want you to."
"192010","193950"," So this is where now inspire right now. "
"194010","195430"," I haven't put up any of the levels yet."
"195430","196610"," Not that they matter right now."
"197370","200950"," You want to see a new high right now so you make where my cursor is right here. "
"201670","203630"," We have a high of three ninety six sixty four."
"204290","205790"," We want to see a new high right now."
"206310","209270"," Even if we come back down to the one minute to go higher to four hundred. "
"210930","215190"," And I'll start snapping in some support and resistance lines for you this morning."
"216030","217370"," We're going to go over the monthly weekly."
"217710","218730"," A whole bunch of stuff for you to look at. "
"219190","220410"," See why we're bullish here."
"220410","221430"," How long we're bullish."
"222470","226110"," What's actually setting up in the market. "
"226110","231090"," And we'll talk about some of the reasons why and depending on how high we go."
"231770","234970"," What could be the catalyst for those moves higher."
"236870","238750"," Here it's the audio sounds found and you're okay. "
"238970","239470"," That's good to hear."
"239750","240730"," So I did see that comment."
"241430","245990"," For my so my friend I've got a sound mixer and then I've got a where these headphones. "
"246850","251610"," And it loops back volume into my ear so I can hear you guys."
"253970","258370"," Or here with the broad how the broadcast sounds to you and right now and I've got a monitor for"
"258370","258890"," that as well."
"259390","265110"," And so in my end I think it's just what I'm hearing from you guys sounds a little tinny. "
"265290","267550"," I don't know exactly why that is right now."
"268670","271650"," Not that matters the moment you guys are probably here to find out what's going on."
"274290","278410"," So we'll look back at last week we've got some time here isn't all over. "
"278750","282330"," I didn't have a chance to go over this this weekend."
"285670","291330"," To get on fin to it or talk to anyone to let you guys know how bullish we actually were"
"291330","293150"," until the open this morning."
"293150","296370"," I mean a couple phone calls this morning to talk about it. "
"297110","301650"," Well a couple followers but I didn't go public with it until just before the bell."
"303690","307350"," So the pivot this morning was that we'll take a look right here."
"308450","309510"," Scroll this up here. "
"313030","315390"," Pivot this morning was that a 39343."
"316890","321770"," I was close enough."
"322650","324170"," I'll go to the five minute real quick. "
"326330","328410"," Give me a second here."
"333590","334890"," Oh there you delete these."
"334990","335850"," Maybe I already deleted these. "
"336170","336950"," Okay that's good."
"344240","346440"," There goes 400 right."
"348420","350740"," They tried to get it in the overnight on Friday. "
"350980","352840"," They got to 396 I think."
"353500","355120"," And they weren't giving anything away for free."
"356560","357780"," We'll put our three up there. "
"360620","363920"," On Friday I wanted them to give something away for free and they weren't giving it to me."
"364700","365680"," So we don't know what the pivot is."
"366980","369000"," Our one is 39849. "
"374670","376030"," So right there that's our one."
"377570","383950"," And you could have seen the implied move this week was very bullish if you had some keen some keen"
"383950","388830"," traders out there should have seen that the implied move this week was going to be quite high."
"392010","401880"," Our two is 401.9. That's our"
"401880","402140"," two. "
"414520","415120"," Pull in there."
"426790","427510"," Oh yeah."
"430750","431470"," 406 15. "
"435110","436070"," Is our three."
"436330","437510"," There's a little yellow line right here."
"437610","439290"," This is the previous high that I want to show you here. "
"443370","446910"," I got these in the wrong spot."
"447370","447870"," Move these over."
"449770","451590"," Or one or two or three. "
"454750","456770"," Oh, this is the pivot down below here."
"466290","471540"," Just left that behind."
"474200","476280"," Maybe to put the supports down below here. "
"476660","478340"," They're not as important today for you."
"480120","482400"," Well, I guess we can really want to."
"483040","484560"," Let me get rid of this box here. "
"486220","491720"," And then I will put S one is 390 83."
"494260","496580"," I gave you some of the critical numbers."
"496680","498100"," We first opened this morning. "
"498360","502860"," I went on to thin to it and tried to drop the time."
"504260","506480"," Time sensitive numbers for you this morning."
"506960","510760"," You saw that we won the five the one we won the one minute and the five minute was off"
"510760","511100"," and running. "
"511100","512780"," It was pretty simple."
"514340","514900"," 3577."
"517559","522500"," And even these this S two like S two S three. "
"522700","523700"," I mean, if we sell S one."
"524740","525300"," It's all over."
"525600","526480"," So I'll let you know that. "
"527100","528080"," 33 17."
"529560","534100"," Don't even be considering S one or S two and S three."
"534280","535940"," If you lose it, it's not going to be good. "
"536640","538160"," It's very bearish."
"541340","546500"," But the weekly in the monthly chart tells a different story of where we're going."
"547100","551120"," And the volume last Friday told a different story that we were in rotation. "
"553380","555980"," We'll go back to the one minute so you can see it again real quick."
"558740","562980"," Now, how bullish we are off of this open right here."
"564740","566860"," You are looking for for continuation. "
"566980","569300"," You are looking for you see how we got this."
"569540","571000"," We are holding a second here."
"573940","574340"," Okay. "
"574500","575480"," Watch watch my cursor here."
"576020","576180"," Right."
"576320","577300"," Like Mr. Yen come up here. "
"577440","577540"," Right."
"578580","579640"," We touched the one minute."
"579840","580320"," We got it. "
"580460","583700"," We actually got a new high and that showed continuation higher."
"583700","584080"," Okay."
"585440","587000"," We didn't get the new high right here. "
"587420","591260"," So I don't have as much faith for where we are right now."
"591260","595240"," I think we're going to come back down and test this five minute right here, but I'm not positive."
"595680","600540"," I'm going to take a look for you on spy and see where we are where we should be coming"
"600540","601020"," back to. "
"602300","603720"," Now my phone is now blowing up."
"605620","606560"," We have a second here."
"608020","608560"," We'll take a look. "
"609880","610500"," Oh, yeah, we're good."
"612060","612820"," We're real good."
"614540","615640"," We're cranking right now. "
"618380","620280"," Spy is super cranking."
"622020","622900"," So I'll bring up."
"629780","630180"," Okay. "
"630440","633420"," So this is the open right here, I think."
"635580","638380"," As soon as soon as we won this open right here was off and running."
"639120","639520"," Boom. "
"640120","640160"," Right."
"640940","641420"," Above again."
"642280","644400"," And we're looking to see if we can hold this right here. "
"644400","646420"," So if you're if you're a bull, right?"
"648560","649680"," Velocity is on our side."
"649760","655680"," You can take a take another long right here and have a stop loss right here."
"655680","655940"," Okay. "
"657020","661780"," You can see here, this 39387 that's moving up right now."
"662200","662840"," Hold on."
"665080","666560"," Let me do something here. "
"666840","668860"," You can see right where you are, this 39786."
"669880","672880"," I've got the the wrong."
"674540","675180"," Let's see there. "
"675560","676280"," Right here."
"676440","677340"," So 39786."
"677720","680760"," If this breaks, we'll come back down and retest below, but I don't think that we are. "
"681580","683520"," We're all over this one minute right now."
"684320","688820"," And the other thing to pay attention to is these three lines down here."
"688880","689980"," This is huge right here, right?"
"690140","692520"," This is extremely bullish for the bulls. "
"693040","695520"," This break above on Friday was massive."
"696680","700500"," When we broke above here on Friday, this was this was the move right here."
"700500","705100"," We'll look back on the weekly and the monthly and show you why this mattered and why we didn't sell"
"705100","708780"," down right at this point at 2 o'clock in the afternoon. "
"709220","710360"," It was game over."
"711160","712820"," It was pretty much game over."
"713060","715900"," It just shows that the continuation would continue to close. "
"716580","717900"," We didn't sell off over the weekend."
"718020","718900"," There was no unknown news."
"719680","720900"," And so we're going to blast off. "
"721220","725280"," We might get 400 today and then 403 come Monday."
"726000","728100"," This would be a natural place to sell 400."
"729820","737620"," You might see a run to 400 reversal, but 403 is on board between today and tomorrow. "
"737640","742660"," This week at some point, I should say, maybe a little bit more cautious, I guess, in what I say"
"742660","752120"," to you guys, but 403 is definitely on board for a move here to get to the top of that"
"752120","753720"," top that expanded wedge."
"753720","755840"," That's kind of growing, right?"
"756480","757760"," You can kind of see it right here."
"760600","762100"," No follow through by bears. "
"762540","763240"," No follow through."
"763380","764360"," The key was this too."
"764840","765660"," Here's the key, right?"
"765740","767500"," We sold off, right?"
"768340","770920"," And you want to recheck. "
"771240","777140"," So if you go back to just Thursday, this Thursday, Friday right here, the key was this."
"780020","781380"," Bull's had nothing here, right?"
"782400","786080"," So we sold down below and then same thing, right?"
"786700","793200"," Oh, blasted down between Wednesday and Thursday to try to get down here, which we know this was"
"793200","793640"," oversold."
"793980","795800"," We knew that we know this is oversold at this point. "
"797240","798440"," There's two keys here."
"799400","801920"," The first recheck here, this wasn't held, right?"
"803900","807040"," And we came back up to right where this level was right here."
"808320","809900"," And this wasn't held, right?"
"809900","813020"," So the moment that that didn't hold, we blasted off into the bell. "
"813880","821100"," So you should already know that the next cell signals right here, okay?"
"822320","823920"," And we're coming into it right now."
"824140","831250"," I'll show it to you where these sellers were prior to."
"832270","834410"," 423, you can call it. "
"835650","840150"," And I guess if you're a bear, you're going to think, you're going to think, oh, yeah, we're just"
"840150","841370"," waiting to take it over again."
"841370","842350"," That's just not the case."
"843830","846450"," This is considered a rotation right here. "
"848310","851210"," What bears wanted to do is to defend that position."
"851730","853970"," So they're either going to defend it here, right?"
"854130","854870"," Or they're going to defend it here."
"855870","857630"," If they're not going to defend it there, right?"
"859570","860630"," We're going to go higher. "
"860810","861830"," Does that make sense to you?"
"862310","868370"," Even if we just do the 100% today and then trade higher here, it shows weakness in bulls here."
"868370","869570"," Arm bears, not bulls."
"870430","873430"," It shows the rotation, the volume yet on Friday as well. "
"873850","875890"," Or the volume in here was massive, right?"
"876350","879230"," Only to see this volume down here and this volume down in here."
"879730","881430"," The market was bought down here."
"882970","888970"," So you're going to expect on Friday you would have wanted to have seen the rejection. "
"889570","891210"," You would have wanted to see the rejection again."
"891850","896270"," I'm assuming if you're a bear, the only thing a bear really could say right here, the only thing"
"896270","901530"," that a bear could say right here is maybe GPM is just looking for liquidity to keep selling."
"902830","904510"," But that's unlikely at this price. "
"905090","911330"," More than likely what you're going to see here is you're going to see us go back up in at"
"911330","912990"," least tag 403 above here."
"913370","915070"," We're going to blast right through this level here."
"915950","917130"," More than likely today. "
"917890","920350"," More than likely today or tomorrow we're going to blast above this level."
"920470","921530"," It's not just going to be a full rejection."
"921530","929290"," And we're going to go back up here and start looking at this 403.64. And this 406.07 here"
"929290","929750"," at minimum. "
"930310","931130"," This right here."
"931710","936390"," Now 410 is on board to attack this as well."
"937190","939210"," We probably will get a pull back before we get up there. "
"939550","942850"," And then 420 is on deck above as well at this point."
"943090","944270"," This is all rotation here."
"944590","949630"," And it's all leading into ER, ER season at least for upcoming tech earnings. "
"951350","952370"," That's what's going on."
"953150","955410"," So yeah, I'll tell you what."
"956150","957890"," I thought bears had it over here. "
"958110","958970"," I thought this was it."
"959890","961630"," Or this right here was it."
"962130","964150"," We have liquidity sold it down. "
"965150","968030"," Bears needed this to start getting down here."
"968830","971370"," To go lower than these levels right here."
"972690","974730"," And you can see it right here, man. "
"975170","977690"," Super bullish and the crazy part is if you look at this on a weekly."
"979190","980490"," We can look at a deli chart."
"981250","982790"," We can do it SPX, maybe. "
"983050","983330"," It's cleaner."
"987820","991460"," So we just start looking at SPX here."
"993980","1001540"," I'm going to make that a little bit bigger here. "
"1002940","1004620"," And get rid of that line right there."
"1004940","1006600"," There's some keys here."
"1008060","1011080"," On Friday, you can see that pulls one the week. "
"1011300","1011820"," Or this is the daily."
"1012140","1012840"," It should be on the weekly here."
"1014380","1016000"," Now they didn't want it convincingly. "
"1016620","1018940"," But when we closed out Friday right here."
"1019620","1020900"," This big red wick right here."
"1021760","1024099"," This is convincingly enough for bulls. "
"1024400","1024980"," So they really need."
"1026180","1028980"," We're closing above on a weekly above the today."
"1029760","1031040"," It's one 31 EMA. "
"1031940","1035160"," Closing above the 27 EMA in a weekly."
"1036319","1037520"," The move is higher."
"1037520","1038599"," I just need you to know that. "
"1038680","1039599"," Okay, they're going to push up."
"1040200","1041220"," They've already done it here."
"1041859","1044859"," And you can see the push up here, push up here, push up here. "
"1045319","1047020"," Bulls have not given up, right?"
"1047760","1050260"," Bears have not won a single candle, right?"
"1050880","1051600"," Haven't won this candle."
"1051900","1052620"," Haven't won that candle."
"1052900","1053640"," Haven't won that candle. "
"1054300","1055160"," Haven't won this candle."
"1056040","1058280"," And when you start adding all this stuff up right here."
"1059020","1060020"," With who's winning these candles. "
"1060940","1061200"," It's bulls."
"1061580","1062080"," It's not bears."
"1063300","1065120"," This is not a good sign for bears. "
"1066080","1068960"," It's showing it the market wants to go up and at least retest."
"1069580","1071320"," These previous levels, right?"
"1071500","1072680"," You got 130 up here."
"1073200","1074820"," You got 410 right here. "
"1075520","1078280"," You've got a gap to fill at 420 right here."
"1079540","1081800"," We started looking at this on a weekly basis here."
"1082100","1084380"," And this is convincing for bulls, right?"
"1085600","1086620"," You see that power move. "
"1086740","1087100"," You see this."
"1087100","1088940"," You see this 131 coming up underneath."
"1089520","1090600"," And just wanting to smash. "
"1091160","1092920"," Just smash higher right here."
"1093940","1095520"," And you know, let's change it to a."
"1095840","1097660"," Let's go to a daily kettle right now."
"1097660","1102780"," And let me put up an M.A. Indicator moving average. "
"1102780","1103920"," This is the one that."
"1105180","1106900"," Missy didn't change this to a 200."
"1108260","1108700"," 200. "
"1111960","1115200"," Yeah, I mean, I don't know what else to say to you, right?"
"1115440","1116460"," Let's look at it here, right?"
"1116800","1119020"," Let me get rid of the EMA is real quick."
"1120940","1123820"," You know, sold down below 200, right?"
"1124900","1127540"," Confirmation blasted down and nothing up here."
"1127540","1128880"," Bam, slammed it down. "
"1129360","1131540"," And I want to show you that."
"1132160","1136540"," You notice how do you notice how when we sell down below, right?"
"1136740","1138460"," It's like one, two, and we're right back down."
"1138520","1139760"," One down and underneath. "
"1141300","1142620"," Convincing convincing, right?"
"1143100","1144860"," We'll get all this time we've spent here."
"1145680","1146680"," We just look at it."
"1147140","1151280"," Just look at it with your eyes, like time spent here, right?"
"1152040","1153000"," Blocked back up, right?"
"1154780","1156600"," Rotation time spent here. "
"1156600","1157980"," Now trading with a green."
"1158320","1162220"," Now trading with a green candle on the daily, right?"
"1162440","1164460"," Above the 200 day moving average."
"1165000","1166920"," I mean, I don't know what I don't know what the F."
"1166920","1167080"," L."
"1167220","1168700"," You need for bullish at this point. "
"1169420","1170840"," I don't know what else you need for it."
"1170900","1172000"," I don't know what else you need to see."
"1172660","1175760"," This is not an open to this isn't below down here. "
"1175780","1178060"," This isn't back on November 30th."
"1178080","1181020"," You know, just trying to throw our neck up higher."
"1181560","1183320"," All this work done right here. "
"1183580","1185500"," You're telling me all this work done right here?"
"1185620","1191160"," And bears couldn't close this last week with conviction to get underneath this lower balance."
"1191740","1192520"," It's bullish."
"1192980","1193600"," That's what it is. "
"1194020","1194420"," It's bullish."
"1196220","1198500"," You've got the inverse head and shoulders coming up."
"1198660","1200380"," We talked about that for the past few weeks. "
"1200640","1202040"," You know where the neckline is here."
"1202380","1203800"," We're above the neckline, right?"
"1204020","1206160"," You want to measure that out and see how high that goes."
"1206980","1210960"," And, you know, if we start measuring, you start getting up and closing this for 20 out. "
"1212440","1213400"," I can't."
"1213460","1220980"," I'll measure it on on a training view for you, but it's, you know, stuff like that."
"1222060","1226160"," So I don't know what to say. "
"1226240","1230120"," If you're a bear right here and I know that JPM Morgan and it was a couple of things."
"1230360","1230940"," We have looming."
"1230940","1235100"," We have a GPM to the JPM caller. "
"1235300","1238600"," But then again, if JPM doesn't doesn't monetize the call side."
"1239320","1240780"," What they can do is run it."
"1240980","1244740"," They can rent instead of monetizing by the put side, they can just run it up. "
"1245020","1248420"," You could also have Jamie Diamond step out at any moment at 406."
"1250180","1252140"," Let's say, let's say 406 up here."
"1252160","1252660"," Let's put 406. "
"1254460","1255520"," It's way up here."
"1256500","1258520"," This is where the caller actually is way up there."
"1261410","1261690"," Right?"
"1262170","1262510"," Way over there. "
"1262650","1263350"," That makes spy."
"1264710","1269010"," That puts spy at 406 right right around there."
"1269010","1269590"," Right around 406. "
"1270470","1271950"," That's where R3 is up here."
"1272470","1275770"," So we're not even at Jamie, Jamie and Emmett Collier, or at least the JPM car."
"1275870","1276590"," No, it's not Jamie Diamond. "
"1276890","1278710"," But JPM caller, we're not even at it yet."
"1280710","1282870"," So is there room to blast up to 406?"
"1283430","1285130"," Together is 403, 406."
"1285910","1287790"," Was this retail bears selling this?"
"1288390","1290530"," Was this just your profit taking on this move?"
"1291290","1293030"," Then the rotation for the move higher here. "
"1294450","1295550"," So can we go higher?"
"1295850","1299770"," Yeah, you can see it on the daily and the weekly candles that we should have opened this morning."
"1300390","1302570"," We should have green-barded up before we even opened this morning."
"1304050","1306030"," And you can see spy just blasting, right?"
"1306890","1309810"," See spy just making new highs, making new highs. "
"1311970","1313950"," Just like a teed right off right here."
"1314370","1315530"," Teed right off."
"1315950","1318370"," Now at 400 you're going to get an auto cell. "
"1319610","1320930"," Algorithms are going to want to sell 400."
"1323110","1324610"," But we are extremely close."
"1324830","1325930"," What's Tesla doing this morning?"
"1326470","1327110"," What's that?"
"1327410","1328490"," 140.35?"
"1329770","1331330"," Is that what Tesla's doing this morning?"
"1331770","1332490"," 140.35?"
"1337030","1337810"," Yeah, baby. "
"1341230","1341630"," Yeah."
"1345230","1347530"," You get a new high off this one right here, right?"
"1348030","1349030"," We got a new high right here."
"1349470","1350350"," You get another new high. "
"1350510","1351330"," It's going to go even higher."
"1352570","1355630"," We'll see if it comes back down in touch as this big blue line right here."
"1358490","1360430"," I'm getting some red balls in right now. "
"1361850","1363570"," Sellers wanting to come in and sell this."
"1365190","1366290"," We haven't sold it yet."
"1368270","1369230"," We haven't sold it yet. "
"1369290","1370210"," Just so you know, we're bullish."
"1371210","1372170"," We're extremely bullish."
"1378800","1388730"," Previous high up here, 400.25. Okay, let's see what"
"1388730","1389790"," you guys are talking about in the chat. "
"1390270","1390730"," How y'all doing?"
"1392310","1393490"," Everybody doing well this morning?"
"1394010","1394690"," We're on the live chat."
"1394690","1396070"," Let's see what you guys are doing here."
"1398810","1402310"," I think if you're a bear, I gave you a fair wine to get the fuck out of the way"
"1402310","1403310"," before nine o'clock, right?"
"1403450","1405510"," Or before nine thirty before they opened. "
"1405790","1408130"," I think the first post I made was we're really bullish today."
"1409050","1409850"," Oh, yeah."
"1411290","1413610"," 400.15. Oh, yeah. "
"1415610","1416290"," Oh, yeah."

"1420630","1426070"," It's 400.22. Oh, yeah."
"1427610","1429130"," What's Tesla doing?"
"1429310","1438830"," 140.21. Well, 426 400.27. Oh, yeah."
"1442550","1444010"," Oh, look at that. "
"1445340","1446310"," We just tagged."
"1446310","1450520"," Just tagged this previous."
"1450520","1451680"," We just we just smack. "
"1451880","1452340"," You know what this is?"
"1452380","1453760"," I tell bears this all the time."
"1454500","1464400"," We broke above the previous high on Thursday to the Wednesday 400.23. Just just beat it by two"
"1464400","1465360"," pennies just then."
"1465940","1466720"," That's bullish. "
"1468380","1469140"," That's bullish."
"1469400","1470640"," That's like when a bear peeks below."
"1471880","1473220"," They go, we're coming back here. "
"1473360","1474540"," We'll be back here in a little bit."
"1479000","1480080"," That was an algorithm."
"1482380","1483180"," We'll do that. "
"1484020","1485800"," Take some money off right here if you can."
"1486920","1488920"," This is the place takes the money off probably."
"1490560","1493940"," That was an algorithm went up there and just slapped it like it was nothing. "
"1494940","1495700"," Look at that."
"1496320","1496760"," I am."
"1498820","1501100"," Come back down here and check the big blue line out. "

"2484490","2490630"," And then like the 420 thing sets us up for a run to 460."
"2491870","2492790"," Some key levels."
"2493090","2495850"," If you're a bull or a bear, you've got some key levels to be looking at. "
"2496250","2498310"," If you're a bear, you want to steer rejection at 403."
"2499290","2503730"," Cause next stops 410, then 420, and then believe it or not, it's like 460 or something."

"3044200","3048660"," Like, I don't want to see XLU and XLP go cranking, but I wanted to see more bid in those"
"3048660","3048920"," two. "
"3049580","3051960"," I want to say on Thursday, it looked like a Friday."
"3052160","3053100"," It looked like walk the plank."
"3053900","3058560"," Like here, we're going to put a bid into earning season, but not by XLU and XLP. "
"3058900","3064140"," So this morning seeing XLU and XLP going to catch a bid is much more bullish."

"3129440","3130860"," Got another new high right here, right?"
"3131020","3135580"," This is indicative of us having continuation here, whether you know that or not."
"3135580","3137060"," Of us having continuation. "
"3137760","3141080"," If you saw our failure for a new high, see this straight right here."
"3142700","3144320"," Right, we tagged down below."
"3144660","3148400"," If we had failed the new high, you'd be looking for a rollover. "
"3148700","3149520"," Now, that's not always."
"3150880","3154180"," It doesn't happen every single time, but you want to be looking for that."

"3181170","3182330"," We just got a new high, right?"
"3182850","3188130"," So in normal circumstances, you would expect us to this to be supportive here for us to go up."
"3189770","3192150"," Now, we're already up point and a half today. "
"3194010","3198250"," So if you take a trade here, the only thing that I would say to you is."

"3257560","3258120"," 32."
"3259040","3260220"," I want to say there. "
"3263990","3266670"," There's 436 roughly right there."
"3267990","3269290"," This is how it's brought."

"3282810","3285190"," So if you look at the clock on your house, right?"
"3285810","3289750"," If you're looking at the clock at your house or your office or your work or something, just keep"

"3302290","3304730"," We're losing the one minute chart right now."
"3304810","3305490"," I'm going to show it to you. "

"3315210","3316030"," 401-17. "
"3317250","3321330"," We're going to be looking to find out if we can get some rejection on this one minute."
"3321630","3323970"," So 401-15."
"3332990","3333390"," 401. "
"3333730","3334230"," It's close enough."
"3334590","3335550"," We're close enough right here."
"3338730","3342290"," It's close enough for this chart for you guys to see it. "
"3345490","3350150"," First time we've faded underneath the one minute since the open."
"3350970","3352890"," Bears want to hold this blue line right here."
"3355330","3356590"," So they can sell it down. "
"3359250","3361930"," And be looking for $399.36 if they can hold it."
"3362130","3364390"," So depending on what your take is right here, right?"
"3366250","3369430"," You can either take puts here and have some stops above the blue line."
"3370190","3377090"," Or you could take a long here and have some stops below this descending line right here, okay?"
"3377550","3381970"," As long as you don't break this descending line right here, you don't hit your stops. "
"3383430","3388820"," You see 403, right?"
"3390720","3395960"," 4 is only $0.28. I'm going to go look at the 402s."
"3406990","3408950"," And I haven't bottomed yet, but I'm going to keep an eye on them."
"3409230","3411590"," And I want to see what happens in the next four minutes. "
"3412770","3414690"," See if we can hold this for the next four minutes."
"3414690","3415250"," If we can."
"3416330","3419670"," I want to make sure that the five minutes not rolling over here. "

"3540550","3544310"," I want to see a stay above for the next five, three minutes, three minutes or so. "
"3584710","3587930"," So even have the new squawk on this morning and even put it on for you."
"3588570","3589950"," They want them muddy in the waters."
"3592410","3593470"," I'll put them on the background. "
"3598880","3600940"," Yeah, Brent is the better trade, right?"
"3601460","3605300"," Goldman Sachs, he's a Brent averaging $97 a barrel in 2023."
"3607000","3609800"," I'm almost there being being stopped out here."

"3639980","3642240"," I turn the news on here for you in the background."
"3643440","3644020"," Don't be here anything. "
"3646760","3649240"," Goldman Sachs, he's a Brent averaging $97 a barrel."
"3650160","3652940"," I like Brent because it's not just US oil supply."
"3653220","3654420"," It's the world oil supply. "
"3654780","3659400"," It also involves the manufacturing, distribution, transportation."
"3667210","3668730"," I'm going to get stopped out here in just a second."
"3677360","3678580"," Trading 56 cents. "
"3678580","3679680"," I'm up penny right now."
"3683560","3684840"," Nope, right there."
"3687420","3688800"," So I got stopped out there. "
"3690900","3694720"," I'm going to be looking for $399.51 just down below here."
"3694860","3695500"," Watch my cursor."
"3704040","3705580"," Unless it's just liquidity break. "
"3705880","3706520"," It's possible."
"3707460","3720390"," Target down below $399.51. I'll"
"3720390","3721810"," pick this back up down here hopefully."
"3722290","3723470"," I hope I can grab it down here. "
"3724410","3726470"," I hope that's just not a liquidation break."
"3726710","3728370"," I'm hoping that I can grab it right here now."
"3730330","3732070"," Right there is where I'd like to grab it. "
"3732810","3734290"," But that's not always how it runs."
"3734590","3736310"," Sometimes it's just the liquidity break."
"3736310","3737850"," Trying to stop out. "
"3737850","3739190"," Stop out longs here."
"3758970","3762390"," Goldman Sachs, these WTI averaging $92 a barrel."

"3789090","3790110"," Let me look and see. "
"3792690","3793570"," I don't know."
"3795610","3797030"," Look at the closer at it."

"3800730","3802490"," I'll give you a price target for light sweet crude. "
"3803950","3805370"," It's bullish at the moment."
"3806270","3811630"," I'd be bullish on it until like 84, 190, 84, 189."
"3814070","3814910"," 84, 189. "
"3815330","3816670"," That's top, I think, for crude crude."
"3817710","3820630"," If it gets rejected there, it's going to be a bloodbath."
"3828700","3832680"," And light sweet crude, they've got a price start of $92 a barrel. "

"4223930","4225550"," Like you just imagine like."
"4226750","4233090"," Imagine like, I don't know, like buying a lawnmaw used lawnmower or something or you buy your kit a"
"4233090","4233330"," car."
"4234350","4235610"," You know, I don't know. "
"4235870","4238630"," I guess you pay taxes on the registration at any rate, but."
"4238630","4242210"," It seems like they're going after Chase and pennies, right?"
"4245630","4247290"," Chase and pennies, Chase and the little guy."
"4247770","4248590"," They have to though. "
"4253990","4255650"," Yeah, fair taxes fixes this."
"4260910","4265770"," It's just, can you imagine just the fines you have to pay for missing some?"
"4265930","4267130"," It's just, it's just such nonsense."
"4268310","4270870"," It actually makes the case for cash too, doesn't it?"
"4271730","4274110"," It makes the case for you to just keep some cash at home. "
"4274110","4279150"," So if you needed to make a payment or something or buy something that's like a, I don't know, five,"
"4279250","4279650"," ten grand."
"4281430","4283830"," Anything from like a thousand to five thousand dollars."
"4283930","4287870"," You probably just want to have a safe at home so that if you wanted to pay somebody for something. "
"4289270","4291430"," Like a thousand bucks is not a lot of money today."
"4292290","4297290"," As a matter of fact, I sold a generator recently."
"4297650","4302490"," I had three pre generators and I had accumulated them over the years. "
"4302950","4304410"," One of them was kind of loud."
"4304630","4308670"," It wasn't an inverter generator generator, but I kept it in pristine condition."
"4309710","4312150"," And I wound up selling it because it was too loud. "
"4313070","4314550"," And it was a cash deal with a welder."
"4315190","4317690"," Like the guy was going to do, the guy was going to do welding."
"4318230","4320110"," And I'm like, I can't even imagine if I had done it. "
"4320670","4324010"," If I had done it over with a Zell or something like that or PayPal."
"4325350","4331250"," I'd begin taxed on, I'd begin fucking taxed on something that I already paid taxes on to buy."
"4334580","4335560"," It's kind of insane. "
"4345030","4345510"," Right?"
"4346010","4352550"," So I would have had to have declared that sale of that generator."
"4355070","4358130"," And I've got like, when I think about it, right?"
"4359570","4362770"," I just put a gun case up for sale on Facebook Marketplace."
"4364090","4365630"," I put a gun case up for sale. "
"4365870","4366430"," I put a level."
"4366870","4368490"," I've got this kick ass German level."
"4369730","4371010"," You can level beams with it and shit. "
"4372090","4373170"," And it's expensive."
"4373490","4375090"," It's not, it's not like a Home Depot special."
"4375090","4376710"," I had to order it special. "
"4379670","4381970"," And I've bought and flipped houses."
"4382370","4384310"," Now I've bought and keep not keep them."
"4385330","4389730"," But when I put these LVL's up in the house trying to blow up the walls and I want to"
"4389730","4398090"," keep the house or the floors level and the house level, I got this big beautiful metal level. "
"4399170","4400090"," And it cost me a lot of money."
"4400090","4403810"," And so I used it, kept it in good shape."
"4404650","4405750"," And I don't need it anymore. "
"4405930","4406630"," I'll never need it again."
"4406850","4411910"," There's nothing that I can, that I can, maybe if I was rebuilding the boat or something, I would"
"4411910","4412230"," need it."
"4412330","4413570"," But it's a very specialized tool. "
"4413950","4418850"," And I'm like, so I'm going to go sell this and then pay taxes on it again."
"4419050","4419550"," It's just insane."
"4419550","4432400"," Oh, yeah,"
"4432700","4433020"," baby. "
"4434060","4437160"," I'm only getting 67 cents right now in those calls."
"4437540","4437920"," Come on."
"4438440","4439360"," Come on dealers. "
"4440280","4441040"," Pay it."
"4442080","4443100"," Pay it dealers."
"4447130","4448570"," Pay the calls dealers. "
"4452830","4455610"," So we pretty much, I want you to see something here."
"4458230","4461730"," When I was talking to you about this, this run right here, right?"
"4462890","4467790"," Got the new high, got the new high, came back down, tested the one minute again."
"4468550","4470330"," We're required to get a new high here. "
"4470490","4470590"," Okay."
"4471210","4477530"," So we want to see, we want to see a new high above the continued trend."
"4478010","4483090"," If we fail to make the new high up here, we will, we will come back down and test this"
"4483090","4485810"," screen, the screen line down here. "
"4489170","4490910"," So you want to see this push up here."
"4495170","4496110"," Come on, baby."
"4497390","4498930"," We don't want to see a failure here. "
"4509780","4510800"," Come on, baby."
"4511920","4512640"," Give me a new high."
"4515400","4516200"," Break above. "
"4517720","4519640"," Keep your eyes on book map right now."
"4520420","4521880"," Sellers trying to step in currently."
"4524400","4526000"," Now squeeze them sellers out. "
"4532970","4536370"," Failure to get this new high, we will, we will roll over up here."
"4536490","4537510"," We're losing some steam here."
"4561290","4565170"," Sorry, I'm watching to make sure we're not getting distribution in the options chain. "
"4588530","4590130"," Is that too loud for you?"
"4590130","4592110"," Let me know in the chat if that's too loud."
"4610350","4611390"," You can't hear it."
"4611590","4612310"," I just turned it up. "
"4623330","4625590"," The apples coming into some resistance here."
"4627670","4631170"," Apple top should be 144.09 or near it."
"4631330","4632270"," It's not going to be exact. "
"4633730","4636770"," I'll show you apple real quick so you can see apple."
"4639870","4642050"," It doesn't always tag exact, but."
"4643450","4644190"," Hold on here. "
"4645350","4657830"," You can see apple top should be 144.05. They're"
"4657830","4658430"," in or about."
"4658810","4662070"," If it breaks above, if apple's about able to get above."
"4663690","4665650"," 144.07, look for some consolidation. "
"4666610","4668150"," This is a place to take profit up here."
"4669810","4671730"," You know, you take your money and run right here."
"4671730","4672090"," Hold on. "
"4674190","4675990"," Start taking your money on apple soon."
"4677250","4678050"," Hold on."
"4678050","4682230"," Hold on here. "
"4683910","4684890"," You want to see."
"4689650","4690890"," You want to see apple."
"4691590","4692630"," You don't want to get in the middle of this. "
"4692770","4695810"," You want to see if apple can get above and consolidate for a move higher."
"4697010","4698130"," But don't get caught in here."
"4698290","4700250"," This is the place that you don't get caught on apple. "
"4711010","4712090"," I'm in here."
"4718190","4719670"," Just a second here."
"4721170","4735470"," There we"
"4735470","4735750"," go. "
"4739980","4742800"," Just had a new high on tasla, very bullish."
"4750790","4753150"," Tasla's about to rip to new highs."
"4754710","4763990"," Apple top looks like maybe 144.10. 144.05 on apple. "
"4766470","4771930"," 144.05. That doesn't mean we get there, but it's close."
"4774110","4775550"," 144.05 on apple."
"4778230","4781290"," So almost another dollar. "
"4790770","4792610"," Spy starting to squeeze higher now."
"4792850","4796190"," 40.46, 402 C is now trading 70 cents."
"4800630","4802450"," We'll be looking to pull the plug here soon. "
"4804710","4806770"," I'm not really getting the oomph that I want."
"4826450","4827930"," Let me show you a book map here."
"4835140","4842360"," Tesla now trading 141.91. This last little green bar right here could be top. "
"4844300","4847600"," If we get one more push higher here on apple on tesla."
"4848700","4850260"," Now it wouldn't be tesla's fault."
"4850520","4854160"," I guess tesla could keep going, but not a bad place to be taking profits soon. "
"4854780","4856580"," Apple's getting a little crispy up here."
"4857300","4866240"," It's high was 143.31 top seems to be a 144.05. When you're within like 60, 70 cents, 75"
"4866240","4874060"," cents on a move like that on apple apple started out this morning at 137.83. So it's had a"

"4884420","4885760"," I'm still long here. "
"4886120","4888900"," I've got my finger literally on the sell button."
"4891060","4892720"," I did, but now I don't."
"4901650","4906230"," Now trading 71 cents on 402 C's. "

"4940550","4941350"," One more penny left."
"4944820","4945860"," Trading 70 cents now."
"4946060","4946860"," I don't want to get caught in this. "
"4947080","4950180"," If we if we green bar up this up and then roll over, it could be fast."
"4957200","4958780"," That'd be raising your stops there."
"4969520","4970180"," One more penny. "
"4971340","4973140"," Nope, now trading 70 cents."
"4978330","4979170"," Yep, I'm out."
"4979350","4979690"," That was it. "

"5061730","5069630"," $1.44.04 on apple price target above."
"5076830","5079950"," Dude, Tesla is bullish as all fuck right now. "
"5082030","5083210"," Tesla's just moving."

"5095390","5144120"," Let's find out trading 401.59. Yeah,"
"5144220","5145640"," I wonder if it'll be Tesla that carries. "
"5146000","5148560"," I'm watching Tesla in the background here to see if they can hold."
"5149240","5151240"," If they can, if it can hold, it's one minute."
"5151340","5156440"," It's at 141, 141, 44. "
"5157840","5159440"," They could push the whole market up."
"5163800","5166400"," It's kind of what you need to hit this price target above here."
"5166840","5170280"," If you're going to hit this price target, you need, you're going to need another, like apples"
"5170280","5171500"," probably not going to do it. "

"5480550","5484770"," Let's draw it on ES and let's draw it on SPX and see if we're above it yet."
"5486850","5489910"," And I'll start posting charts of SPX instead of spy."
"5494050","5497950"," They're like, they're like, find me a chart that says that we're not above. "
"5499530","5503650"," You know, like the, uh, find me a chart that we're not above that descending line."

"5644490","5645530"," We're just joining us."
"5645650","5648010"," You can always speed up the playback so that you're with us live."
"5648970","5654490"," You can go down to the cog whale of the broadcast and click on the cog whale. "
"5654670","5658350"," It's in settings and then go to playback speed, click times three."
"5659610","5663270"," And there should only be a delay of a few seconds from where I am and where you are unless"
"5663270","5664270"," you have slow internet."
"5675850","5678390"," We'll let everybody watch and, uh, we'll put spy up real quick. "
"5678550","5680310"," Make sure I'm doing this the right time."
"5680310","5690710"," A little bit"
"5690710","5691330"," more bleed off."
"5694910","5696150"," We'll see a little bit more here. "
"5716470","5718050"," Let me just a little bit more."

"5741600","5742960"," A little bit more."
"5758680","5759120"," Patience. "
"5761380","5780090"," I was"
"5780090","5784430"," telling my buddy Joe, I said, uh, don't be, don't be break dancing over 40 years old."
"5784570","5786510"," If you break dance over 40 years old, you're going to feel it."
"5791320","5792420"," Especially after skiing. "
"5792820","5795340"," You know, the other thing too is normally like go to the mountains."
"5796480","5800020"," They used to live in the mountains for a long, long time, but when I'm at sea level now."
"5801040","5804960"," That shit takes like two, three days to get adjusted to if not a week. "
"5806840","5808520"," And park city is not that high up."
"5808640","5810800"," It's not like 12,000 feet, but it's like nine."
"5811220","5812000"," I think it's 8,700. "
"5813420","5815020"," I didn't buy this here by the way."
"5815260","5816140"," I want to see her."
"5816260","5817800"," I want to see us tag the screen line. "
"5818480","5819500"," We might not tag it here."
"5822520","5823160"," Still waiting."
"5825340","5831200"," But still like normally like I get out there and, and I'm like to go off a ski really hard. "
"5831300","5833020"," I'm usually dead by day three."
"5833920","5838960"," Day four can't handle it anymore, but if I can like take my time, it's not so bad."
"5842660","5847400"," Dude, when you just like when you like flying to SLC and then you go to park city and you"
"5847400","5848060"," just ride hard. "
"5849380","5852400"," Like day two day three fucking done."
"5863040","5864060"," We'll go in second boys."
"5945860","5948000"," Yeah, we're talking about I was on the phone a friend. "
"5948120","5949740"," He's saying that they're selling futures right now."
"5950720","5954040"," If you look in the if you look in the bottom right hand side, you can see the."
"5955760","5957480"," The sellers are in the market right now. "
"5957580","5961860"," I've got like 3000 more sellers than buyers in the market right here."
"5962160","5964460"," I want to see us roll down if we can."
"5964920","5968560"," I'd like to see us roll down to this green line right here and see if I can pick this"
"5968560","5968780"," up. "
"5972020","5973800"," Dixie's forming a base right now."
"5974880","5976800"," So it's going to be a little bit concerned."
"5977580","5979140"," A little bit concerned. "
"5980060","5981980"," Dixie's looking a little bullish right now."
"5982700","5986510"," A little bullish."
"5992000","5993000"," Kind of bullish. "
"5996200","5998380"," Look on the five minute Dixie."
"6001220","6003400"," We'd really like to see Dixie fail here."
"6005140","6006360"," We'll look on Vix real quick. "
"6017320","6025780"," You look around the market will watch H.Y.G. H.Y.G. come down a little bit more."
"6026720","6028580"," We could blast through here a little bit here."
"6029420","6030820"," We could we could dip down here. "
"6031060","6032920"," H.Y.G. has got some more room to go down."
"6033680","6035920"," H.Y.G. can get on like seventy six eleven."
"6036120","6037620"," It's now trading seventy six seventeen. "
"6038840","6040820"," I'm watching H.Y.G. right now in the background."
"6042980","6045960"," Oh, let me look around the market and see what's going on."
"6048600","6049520"," Like so left. "
"6050980","6052920"," Yeah, XLF's got some room to run down."
"6053540","6055580"," You don't want it to lose its one minute right here."
"6061260","6062240"," Look at Tesla. "
"6064120","6066080"," Tesla's got some room to come down a little bit."
"6066620","6068440"," Could see a little bit more brake lower."
"6069540","6071800"," Look at Spy real quick again. "
"6073420","6074120"," See here."
"6076920","6077960"," Yeah, I don't know man."
"6078080","6078980"," I think I'm long on this. "
"6079860","6080940"," I got to take a look at this."
"6081800","6087520"," You know, because Spy can come down to three ninety four ninety one."
"6087520","6088460"," Let's look at it. "
"6089620","6092200"," They could get a pretty decent cell here."
"6092600","6094060"," I'm going to mute book map for a minute."
"6095580","6098640"," Three ninety four ninety one. "
"6101120","6102540"," Pretty big cell, right?"
"6104740","6109180"," Three ninety four ninety one puts us like right here."
"6113330","6115550"," Bears are getting bears are licking their chops."
"6116070","6117450"," Bears want to see this reject. "
"6118370","6120930"," So if you're just joining us, we don't know what we do here."
"6121610","6125810"," Bears want to see rejection off this blue line."
"6126450","6128270"," And then they want this move right here. "
"6128390","6130670"," This is where the money is for bears."
"6133910","6134350"," Now."
"6141560","6143100"," It's kind of a big move, right?"
"6143300","6145120"," Give it all back by end of day. "
"6146560","6149780"," Price started above four oh three sixty four."
"6149900","6150540"," It'd be a big move."
"6153110","6153990"," We'll see it here. "
"6159460","6160140"," Could be."
"6161720","6163460"," When I'm looking at some."
"6163700","6165060"," So I'm looking at both of these, right?"
"6165180","6166940"," I'm looking at a price right about four or three. "
"6169000","6174540"," And bears are saying, if we start breaking down here, but I'm looking around the market and I'm"
"6174540","6176320"," like, yeah, we could dip and then rip."
"6177720","6179060"," That's what I think is going to happen."
"6179060","6180860"," It needs to be something like this. "
"6181920","6187160"," Like a dip and rip, but there because here I'll look at Dixie real quick or H Y G."
"6189020","6193740"," And the H Y G right here is looking a little sickly, right?"
"6193980","6196500"," We've got a gap down below and H Y G."
"6196700","6199020"," We've got some some confluence coming over here."
"6199620","6200700"," Not looking too good."
"6202720","6203240"," XLF. "
"6206200","6208080"," It's sitting on support right here."
"6210740","6211420"," Hold on here."
"6211580","6212500"," Get back to spy. "
"6214380","6215740"," I'm going to bring up."
"6223510","6225090"," Taking a look at H Y G."
"6226830","6228190"," It's kind of sitting on."
"6229930","6233410"," You see this down below here 75 43. "
"6241430","6244570"," Came down retested, consolidated, boom, move higher."
"6246130","6247130"," Coming down right here."
"6247230","6248350"," It's kind of what you want to see, right?"
"6248790","6249190"," Consolidation. "
"6249390","6250810"," You don't want to see this blast down."
"6252030","6253490"," This is where shit gets ugly."
"6253770","6257530"," This was, I believe last Thursday, or last Wednesday, Thursday. "
"6258990","6261430"," Bears want to get this back in their court right here."
"6261910","6265190"," So bulls are looking to get this to just consolidate here at minimum."
"6268160","6271600"," Remember this number down here is 75 50. "
"6286910","6287850"," Now it's 425."
"6290090","6291850"," I'm going to look around XLF."
"6292210","6293130"," Check XLF real quick. "
"6294910","6298700"," Kind of the same thing."
"6301600","6303540"," With XLF as H Y G."
"6304500","6304940"," Tesla."
"6305980","6307420"," Tesla's got room to run, man. "
"6307560","6310120"," The thing about this is that there's room to run."
"6310360","6311160"," So I want to show you this."
"6311700","6313880"," The reason I'm still bullish here is because. "
"6314940","6316680"," Tesla's got tons of room to run, right?"
"6318900","6321060"," Like, Tesla can just run all day long."
"6322420","6324980"," 193.46. We'll look at Amazon."
"6328740","6329300"," Oopsie. "
"6337060","6339220"," Amazon's kind of clunking around right now."
"6339700","6346760"," It's getting, you're looking for rejection on Amazon for 96.29. But it's got."
"6351990","6354350"," You know, it's got this hourly underneath it. "
"6354490","6355730"," This is big news right here."
"6355810","6357730"," You see this, see this under this hourly underneath."
"6358810","6361950"," Usually this is telling you a different story than us breaking. "
"6361950","6363970"," It's more of like a dip and rip here."
"6364310","6365210"," Does it make sense?"
"6366770","6367830"," Metas like this."
"6375740","6377400"," Met extremely bullish. "
"6377700","6380000"," Even if it rolls a little bit, it's it's bullish."
"6380540","6381900"," It's a bullish context."
"6382980","6385100"," Even it pulls back to like 140. "
"6386180","6386700"," 31."
"6387820","6390980"," 142.23. Maybe we just rest here a little bit."
"6393220","6397200"," All of, not all thing that, but I mean, a lot of thing that still has room to run here"
"6397200","6397680"," is my point. "
"6403800","6405300"," So I guess the question becomes."
"6407680","6410600"," Does it just kind of weaken a little bit and then we get the rip?"
"6411160","6413100"," Or do we actually start bloodbath in it?"
"6413660","6415820"," I don't think we see the bloodbath here as of yet."
"6416060","6417000"," I can't see that. "
"6430040","6432180"," H Y G is looking like that, but."
"6433680","6434700"," Thing man is not."
"6436380","6438800"," Thing man is not done with the with gas. "
"6442420","6443720"," We'll look at N D X next."
"6449580","6451040"," There's your cell signal above."
"6452480","6453360"," Right up here. "
"6453360","6458320"," Oh, that beautiful that is right."
"6459000","6462760"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam."
"6463140","6469940"," I still think that's the target for now is that could be wary of would be wary of thinking. "
"6470880","6473080"," Like I can see I see it in spy."
"6473560","6474300"," I don't see it."
"6475820","6477620"," Around the entire market here. "
"6479940","6481740"," I'm not seeing it everywhere in the market."
"6483360","6484600"," Maybe just a pullback."
"6485500","6486500"," Maybe you see. "
"6488360","6491400"," Tesla pullback here, right, but not the full."
"6492160","6495700"," Not the full Monty of the bloodbath down here."
"6500780","6501800"," Just a breeze. "
"6502020","6502780"," Just some breathing room."
"6503580","6505420"," Same thing here with Apple, right?"
"6505720","6507020"," Just just some sideways."
"6508920","6509520"," Consolidation. "
"6510000","6513280"," A continuation up higher and tag that tag that."
"6513540","6515120"," A target above."
"6516340","6517160"," We had up here. "
"6520470","6522550"," We just just just let it be for a minute."
"6523930","6525910"," It was one forty four or five or something."
"6539560","6543340"," Yeah, so I'm just I'm going to keep a cool right here. "
"6543840","6545140"," I want to see what happens here."
"6545880","6549140"," I've got some calls set up, but we didn't tag the green line."
"6549400","6550320"," So I'm just going to let it be. "
"6550620","6552180"," I don't want to I don't want to sit here for the next."
"6552880","6554440"," Two hours and do this nonsense."
"6555500","6556880"," And then we get the move higher. "
"6558540","6560060"," I'm definitely not bearish here."
"6560780","6561980"," Just looking around the market."
"6562080","6566630"," I'm not I'm not bear. "
"6566750","6570250"," I'm not bear because the bearish move down is three ninety four."
"6571290","6575770"," If you want to get bearish here, you really want to see a break of this blue screen line right"
"6575770","6576070"," here."
"6576670","6578690"," Until you see a break of four hundred two nine. "
"6579350","6580650"," You're not we're not bearish."
"6582570","6583850"," The way is up."
"6585330","6586490"," At some point today. "
"6587530","6589250"," Unless you see a break of the screen line."
"6589650","6590550"," Move is still up."
"6591170","6595250"," Just waiting for some other some other corners of the market to catch up here. "
"6604180","6611670"," Just waiting for other parts of the market to catch back up."
"6637410","6638910"," Yeah, I mean we do is."
"6640850","6642130"," What you end up doing is. "
"6644990","6645770"," You end up."
"6651690","6660210"," You guys know about by we say the whole time right you buy the meeting and you sell the minutes."
"6662190","6663290"," They're going to buy the meeting. "
"6663630","6668490"," There's this thing I was talking to somebody I was talking to Joe Harper before the broadcast this"
"6668490","6668830"," morning."
"6670430","6673030"," No, I said I wouldn't say this publicly, but I'm gonna."
"6674090","6675850"," So a little talk with you guys this morning. "
"6677530","6682310"," So there's some key numbers right we've got four I want you to write this down somewhere four or"
"6682310","6684910"," three four ten four twenty four sixty."
"6689490","6692290"," There's so you have to have a reason to get there."
"6693650","6698050"," Not a reason, but maybe a ramp for a reason to get there the only thing the only things that"
"6698050","6698550"," I could see. "
"6698550","6702350"," No, I don't think this is going to happen."
"6702590","6703930"," I shouldn't say this publicly."
"6708430","6713930"," Because it doesn't mean anything but it was interesting because this morning I was chewing on this"
"6713930","6714970"," and I'm like okay so. "
"6715750","6720870"," What news could make us go to four ten let's say or like four or three is not a big"
"6720870","6723250"," deal but like four ten four twenty four sixty how do you get there."
"6723890","6730470"," There's only a few reasons I could see us getting there and or that are known so I was like."
"6731630","6738810"," I was like I get the ramp into big I get the ramp into into big tech earnings or blue"
"6738810","6740450"," chip earnings or whatever right. "
"6741470","6747950"," I get the ramp into Tesla earnings I get that like I can swallow that if you force that to"
"6747950","6748150"," me."
"6749530","6753230"," Now you've shorted Tesla down so much now there's no point in having."
"6754110","6759310"," Having a risk on the risk on Tesla right before earnings you've already made your money if you"
"6759310","6761730"," shorted it down there's no reason to. "
"6763510","6769030"," If anything you're just looking for a reason to close short right whatever your max gain and now"
"6769030","6770370"," you just take money and run."
"6771370","6774870"," You don't need to have any kind of risk on foreign earnings that might be good."
"6774870","6781090"," There's no reason to right if you're looking at just logically you've made your money so I"
"6781090","6782190"," understand that get that. "
"6783110","6790550"," Another JPM callers above at four zero six five or four zero six zero on SPX so we have got"
"6790550","6793610"," room to run for that I get that I'm understanding all that."
"6796190","6805400"," The only way that I see four twenty would have to be"
"6805400","6807540"," the fed staying the course."
"6810320","6813280"," In their rates that's the only thing I could see is being. "
"6815060","6818900"," The bullish move that would mean that someone that would mean that someone knows."
"6821240","6824080"," That the fed's going to stay the course with rate increases."
"6828580","6833060"," I guess the other argument for that could be that they are going to pause so they want to get"
"6833060","6834780"," us up there to short the market. "
"6837760","6840440"," To four twenty I guess that could be a counter argument to that."
"6841120","6845180"," There's a moment that they pause the moment that they cut rates we're going down."
"6846560","6850580"," There could be a quick quick rip higher to grab some liquidity and then sell the fuck out of the"
"6850580","6850900"," market. "
"6852420","6857020"," But like four sixty I'm like how do I get to that how do you get to four sixty I"
"6857020","6858040"," don't think the fed."
"6859760","6862420"," Staying the course brings us to four sixty."
"6863160","6867220"," I'm like how do you get there and then I was looking at. "
"6868860","6869820"," Bill Ackman."
"6871560","6878300"," Came out asking about possible end to the train war in December he asked that we went on a run"
"6878300","6879840"," right when he posted that."
"6880720","6886420"," Like the next week or two was like a relentless run and then he came out this morning and asked"
"6886420","6888020"," and made a statement about. "
"6890100","6891140"," Military watches."
"6895980","6900920"," Ukraine military watches and I was like I was like man every time this guy talks about Ukraine it"
"6900920","6901880"," seems like we go up."
"6904000","6909820"," So not that I think that war is ending specifically but normally we'll find out before. "
"6915900","6922280"," They you know if they see it ending in springtime or summertime you could possibly see."
"6923980","6928600"," Like a three hundred point move up higher so maybe they're going to front run that end to a war"
"6928600","6930500"," in spring or summer possibly."
"6933610","6938910"," You know they have offices in Ukraine and in Russia and they probably are meeting or no people. "
"6940430","6942490"," They're expecting an end of the war at some point."
"6943530","6946890"," That could be so that wouldn't mean for sixty right now but."
"6949370","6953250"," If there's if they're data scientists and their contacts are saying. "
"6954990","6957910"," One way or another this war ends by March June."
"6959270","6961170"," They'll front run the market for that."
"6961210","6962590"," That's the only way that I see it. "
"6962930","6966010"," Only way I see that that high that high is."
"6966430","6969690"," I couldn't I couldn't give any other reason to get that high in the market."
"6969690","6974410"," And so what they would do is front run it you might see like a fifty point or a hundred"
"6974410","6978990"," point rip because we're already up two hundred points then they'll sell into you. "
"6980670","6984510"," Up there right you'll you'll be thinking they were going up another three hundred points and you'll"
"6984510","6987290"," forget about the other two hundred that we've already gone up."
"6989790","6994770"," And Joe Joe disagreed with me this morning but I was looking at it more from the perspective of"
"6994770","6997030"," like tail risk on the upside."
"6998790","7004650"," And you guys know that you always have to consider tail risk on the downside right if there isn't"
"7004650","7009050"," something unexpected happen to the market and the banks don't like to have anything unexpected. "
"7010850","7015530"," Same thing happened in the fall of the Soviet Union the banks had offices in those countries so"
"7015530","7018490"," you'd expect them to attempt to front run."
"7020550","7023910"," Front run any kind of an end of the war even if it's like three months away or six months"
"7023910","7024190"," away."
"7024670","7029330"," They could try to front run it so they just said there's no way it's going to end early and"
"7029330","7034710"," I'm like I don't think that it is but if they know that it's going to end in three to"
"7034710","7037490"," six months they could front run that end to the war. "
"7038770","7043370"," Regardless of what's public there could be stuff behind the scenes that we don't know about."
"7045210","7052230"," Or not considering right we always get so myopic in our or myopic in our lens or you know like"
"7052230","7057890"," the blinders are on like you put on a horse we don't get to see everything they're not going to"
"7057890","7058570"," tell us everything."
"7059510","7064630"," They might front run it like the worst that could happen this is the fact that part of our front"
"7064630","7067090"," run shit is you front run it. "
"7067870","7072150"," So let's say let's say you're a this is my point here let's say you're a bank and you're like."
"7073570","7078390"," You're like okay we know the feds not gonna pause here but we know they're gonna pause this year."

"7084310","7086690"," to my head and I'm like okay I know the fed is gonna. "
"7087250","7090710"," Is gonna cut rates and they don't so they get pushed into a corner."
"7090710","7098030"," And then the next meeting they don't pause or cut rates and then we're going to a terminal rate."
"7099370","7105870"," We only have so many more rate increases before at a terminal rate so you're you were a banker you"
"7105870","7106250"," would say. "
"7107130","7112410"," To yourself I know we're gonna hit a terminal rate sooner than later as time passes I know that"
"7112410","7115650"," likely the fed is going to pause they were told us they're gonna pause."
"7117430","7121930"," After their rate hikes are done and time is passing right we're burning the candle."
"7123010","7128990"," And then you probably have some data scientists saying how long does this work and it lasts and you"
"7128990","7130770"," know you hear the newspapers and you hear. "
"7131970","7137150"," How people talk in public and fear and screaming bloody murder about."
"7137850","7141690"," You know we're getting tanks and panzers and all this stuff and it's not that that doesn't make a"
"7141690","7142030"," difference."
"7142030","7144490"," It's that you start to weigh. "
"7145970","7152330"," Well how long does it last is it last until March does it last until June or you telling me"
"7152330","7156070"," that it's not going to end before end before the end of 2023."
"7156650","7159330"," You tell me that this lasts longer than two years."
"7159850","7160850"," It's kind of like. "
"7161970","7166930"," You know like the risk or it's like if you were a gambling man right you're out there at a"
"7166930","7168510"," blackjack table."
"7169230","7174990"," And you won for about a year year let's say you're like okay I can have a winning streak for."
"7176190","7183290"," Let's say let's say averages I might win ten hands in a row and you you're on your seventh hand"
"7183290","7188110"," of winning right your your chances of winning start to go down right. "
"7188770","7190910"," You know you're going to lose a hand at some point."
"7192070","7195370"," So you know the more that you're the more that you're winning and you're winning and you're winning"
"7195370","7199750"," and you're winning it's all great but the closer and closer you get to."

"7205490","7211030"," times four times six times ten times you know eventually it's going to go off and you're going to"
"7211030","7211250"," lose. "
"7212510","7219430"," And so when you're looking at the fed pause coming and you want to have some liquidity for that fed"
"7219430","7222810"," pause you want to be high enough that you can sell down and make max gains."
"7223470","7228650"," You know that you don't want to get interrupted by an end to the Ukraine war I guess that's the"
"7228650","7233010"," only way that I see that 460 or 420 I guess."
"7239370","7246930"," And you know if the if the Ukraine war doesn't end in the fed pauses the banks have killed two"
"7246930","7248690"," birds with one stone right they've. "
"7249010","7254690"," They've front run impossible end of the Ukraine war they've front run to a point for a pause to"
"7254690","7255270"," sell the market."
"7256770","7261710"," I guess that's the only I'm trying to figure out in my head how that happens."
"7263030","7267570"," I don't know what you guys think in the comments because my view is. "
"7272410","7278250"," My view is the moment that they that the fed pauses or cuts rates we're going to sell."
"7280110","7286350"," And my view is also that they will try to front run even even just the potential of an end"
"7286350","7289470"," to the war and the next three to six months will try to front run it."
"7301600","7305860"," They say in the federal not pivot they will keep increasing rates and hold them inflation is a fat"

"7319760","7321660"," We have we've actually gone up since May."
"7323620","7326000"," So that would that would lend us to going up. "
"7340630","7345110"," Yeah I'm not I'm not a believer in the market going down right now with rates going up."
"7345550","7348010"," We saw that in the 70s and 60s."
"7349370","7355190"," When the Volcker moments was actually Volcker increasing rates and the market go the market said we"
"7355190","7357850"," believe you and so the market continued to go up. "
"7357850","7359070"," It just melted up."
"7359950","7366170"," And the moment that they cut rates we actually dumped the market unemployment skyrocketed and we"
"7366170","7367810"," dumped it."

"7524640","7525600"," That's dangerous."
"7533020","7535300"," Like even hard like hard money loans are dangerous."
"7536360","7543240"," If you're in a housing market is good hard money loans are good because you can be in and out. "
"7544820","7551120"," And you're like motivated to sell but if you're like buy a house for like 150 to sell for 350"
"7551120","7552400"," to 500,000."
"7553480","7556360"," If the market turns on you and you've got a mortgage on it."
"7557240","7562880"," That shit's crazy like the carry costs on that shit taxes all that fucking stupid shit you get you"
"7562880","7571660"," get torched inflation wage inflation goods inflation all that shit will get will torch you. "

"7614440","7619800"," rent it out blah blah blah blah if you're not near a resort or something where you can catch an"
"7619800","7621820"," Airbnb beer can be really dangerous."

"7637940","7640540"," Oh yeah like a lot of officers got it right."
"7641000","7645180"," You buy it with cash you rehab it rent it refinanced it that's the way to do it."
"7646940","7650880"," That's the way you do it refinanced it after though you have to you have to like buy it with"
"7650880","7658600"," cash pay for the fucking rehab put the renter in then you refinance the order though is what I'm"
"7658600","7661740"," talking about. "
"7662240","7670960"," I used to meet a lot like in the in 0708 people were out there just getting mortgages like they"
"7670960","7672260"," just getting mortgages and houses."
"7672600","7679320"," I haven't seen it as bad this time around like this time around I've most people are cash like they"
"7679320","7682700"," come out with cash you'll see this is even like past five or 10 years."
"7682700","7688380"," So when people say there's like a big house there's gonna be a big housing crash I'm not I'm not"
"7688380","7694620"," fully on board with that most of the guys I know I mean most you see a few out there"
"7694620","7696460"," what normally they'll start small. "
"7696680","7700340"," And you'll see a few be like I'm going over to that rich community I'm gonna buy one of those"
"7700340","7704820"," and I'm with a mortgage and I got like 200 paying cash when I rehab it and flip it I'm"
"7704820","7705420"," like that's dangerous."
"7706500","7707300"," Super dangerous."
"7708120","7713100"," You want to be in like a working man's neighborhood working woman's neighborhood and get someone"
"7713100","7715920"," that's like a mechanic with a license to rent a house from you. "
"7720420","7723120"," And refinance that shit after you put a renter in."
"7733600","7738220"," No that's not what I'm saying what I'm saying is that my point is that."
"7739300","7745060"," Most of the guy dude seriously I'm in some private groups with like hundreds of people like not the"
"7745060","7746380"," new people that are buying. "
"7746940","7753600"," I'm talking about the last five ten years everybody's in cash like everybody owns everything in"
"7753600","7755060"," cash like pure cash."
"7756840","7763900"," People learn their lesson most most of the people that I know outright own it own real estate"
"7763900","7767680"," sometimes they take they get a renter in there they get like a section eight renter."
"7768920","7775360"," They'll definitely take a refi on that house but most guys I know that buy and hold they own their"
"7775360","7775820"," shit outright. "
"7780590","7785950"," Yeah building companies you know the only thing up there about building companies is is this is"
"7785950","7789170"," when we went into the GFC I'll try to pull the article up."
"7789550","7796150"," When we were in the GFC right the great financial crisis we had a renter shortage a housing rental"
"7796150","7798170"," shortage of 15%."
"7799130","7809090"," In the GFC so many people got hurt that are we couldn't keep up with building rentals afterwards we"
"7809090","7814710"," went to like a 20 to 25% shortage I think maybe even 30 I think it's down to 20"
"7814710","7815130"," right now. "
"7815310","7822730"," And then we went to like 30 in the GFC so you're turning new new people into renters even more"
"7822730","7823590"," than ever before."
"7824710","7830210"," So even in this market right here if we have if we have this this end of this short term"
"7830210","7831510"," debt cycle whenever it happens."
"7831850","7836490"," So let's say we've got a high unemployment rate finally we start taking people out of their houses"
"7836490","7839010"," and they get the divorce they lose their dog and lose their kids. "
"7839790","7842750"," We've never caught up in building rental homes."
"7844270","7850530"," So like the builders might not be building anymore but any new properties that are being built are"
"7850530","7851650"," being turned into rentals."
"7851650","7857290"," I think that's the key is that when you look at the GFC when you look at the GFC if"
"7857290","7863170"," you go back and look at the numbers the rental market fucking boomed like it went out of control. "
"7863530","7869890"," And so you see people today buying up all these properties they don't care about all these investor"
"7869890","7874730"," all these small investors that have like 10 20 30 40 50 100 houses."
"7874730","7882410"," These these guys are waiting for another meltdown but the housing market to come down and for the"
"7882410","7885470"," unemployment rate to rise so that they have a house ready for these people."
"7885750","7894450"," Does that make sense I think we're in the same page but not looking at it from from looking at"
"7894450","7895230"," it from different perspectives. "
"7895810","7900830"," So most of the guys that I know they're buying and holding right they're not flipping they've"
"7900830","7905990"," bought with cash they've refinance taken the money out of the refi with a renter in it."
"7906610","7910890"," And they're waiting for this unemployment rate to go out people lose their mortgages that some"
"7910890","7912090"," people about the top or whatever."
"7913410","7920470"," And there should be even more demand for rentals down the road and if building companies are going"
"7920470","7923350"," out of business that means nothing if they've built houses at this point. "
"7923910","7928250"," Just like black rocks been buying all these different banks and buying up all these build to rent"
"7928250","7928530"," homes."
"7929650","7931190"," It's an anticipation of this."
"7931390","7939170"," So even in the GFC rentals did very well rock solid that's part I think we talked about this in"
"7939170","7939930"," a post on. "
"7941750","7946210"," I think I spoke about this in a post on a guy comes out for I said reads are down"
"7946210","7947650"," 48% or something."
"7948830","7953330"," He'd be like yeah I'm going to short the real estate market but the reality is there are parts of"
"7953330","7962410"," the real estate market like rentals where there might be a huge investment opportunity in the next"
"7962410","7963010"," year or two."
"7972070","7972510"," Yeah. "
"7974510","7975450"," Yeah yeah I agree."
"7976510","7981470"," I agree with this there's that there's a whole other side to this story that there's a whole other"
"7981470","7983550"," side to this story that people forget like."
"7984250","7987950"," We have a housing shortage for rentals in the US right now. "
"8000770","8004510"," There's an evil correlation between the price of eggs the scarcity of baby formula."
"8006390","8011110"," In the cost of winter heating utility power the cost of rent the rise of crime and the correction"
"8011110","8013510"," corruption and government amen I believe that too."
"8024010","8030150"," Yeah well so let's look at this so cap the same cap cap rates were slowly low when rates are"
"8030150","8032650"," at sub 3% yeah wait well. "
"8033450","8040970"," I mean so the thing with housing is I think the thing with housing is you had yelling back in"
"8040970","8044030"," yelling thought even if the market crashes."
"8045770","8049010"," We still have the housing market main street is going to be fine right."
"8053630","8055110"," The issue becomes. "
"8057410","8060130"," You see maybe so let's say some guy bought a house."
"8060410","8061550"," Let's say a house."
"8063130","8064990"," Let's say house five years ago. "
"8067830","8069490"," There's ways to look at this."
"8069490","8078550"," So let's say a house five years ago cost $500,000 and let's say it went up to $800,000"
"8078550","8080250"," in the past five years."
"8080810","8083790"," It's just as an example that goes to $800,000. "
"8085170","8090010"," The rates are up a little bit they're not actually up that much right five percent it's not that"
"8090010","8090270"," bad."
"8093030","8098690"," So you say to yourself okay I've got my this is this we'll call her Mary Mary's like I'm going"
"8098690","8100530"," to buy a house for 800 grand."
"8101690","8103270"," And I know it was 500. "
"8103270","8108830"," I know it's it's high right now but I'm going to capture this zero interest rate lock it in."
"8109230","8115070"," And this is our forever home so you know John goes to work and Mary's going to work and they"
"8115070","8116570"," got our pumping out a couple kids."
"8117890","8121170"," And they don't get caught up in the end of this short term death cycle. "
"8124170","8127650"," And so they got to say $800,000 house they're paying their mortgage every month."
"8129690","8132750"," And market doesn't go up anymore but starts to come down."
"8135530","8139230"," And so they look at their neighbors and the neighbors can't sell their home and they're like don't"
"8139230","8140610"," worry about it we're just going to stay here honey. "
"8141750","8147270"," And then what you're looking for is like one neighbor over there in your neighborhood to have had"
"8147270","8150550"," some bad debt and he gets cleaned out or she gets cleaned out."
"8151390","8152870"," And so that house goes for sale."
"8154950","8158810"," And it doesn't it no one buys it right comps the neighborhood of good but there's no buyers. "
"8159930","8164830"," So your neighborhood comp at 800,000 now goes down to 750."
"8164830","8170670"," And then someone else has some bad debt in your street not you you're doing great you're doing"
"8170670","8171290"," great work right."
"8171650","8174190"," You and your husband are not going to lose your house your jobs. "
"8175190","8179570"," But you're paying mortgage now with zero zero percent interest but it's at 750."
"8181250","8185950"," Next neighbor can't sell so it comes down to 7.25 then it's 7 right then it's 650."
"8187230","8192030"," And then it's 600 right now you're starting to panic right you bought it eight. "
"8193389","8194370"," You're paying on eight."
"8195190","8200570"," And it starts to get back down to that 550 600,000 number down there."
"8201389","8204969"," That's where it becomes am I ever getting you start to panic right. "
"8205590","8211950"," You're like am I ever getting out of this I'm upside down in this house for for $800,000."
"8212730","8219549"," I'm just paying the interest at this point and the house is now only worth 600 right and paying"
"8219549","8220549"," interest in this house."
"8220549","8229230"," And you'll see that you'll see like you'll see people think I'm upside down right now I'm never"
"8229230","8230090"," going to recover. "
"8230790","8235150"," And so they'll think well I was going to ride ride this out for the next five years or ten"
"8235150","8235490"," years."
"8235809","8242090"," And you realize that it's probably going to take three to ten years for you to ever get the market"
"8242090","8248670"," back to maybe that 800 to a million dollars maybe the million is like decade away."
"8248670","8249049"," Do you know what I mean?"
"8251129","8254950"," And now you're in your now you're in your 40s almost a year. "
"8258750","8260110"," That's right look at that wick."
"8262530","8263370"," We're going up."
"8265049","8266610"," So you just have a cycle goes. "
"8267950","8271330"," And then you've got Jimmy Barry's out there saying that."
"8273209","8275209"," That's not how it's going to go he's saying that."
"8276250","8281910"," Because that's what I see happening I see you know maybe like a third of your neighborhood loses"
"8281910","8284530"," their home but the other two thirds don't. "
"8285530","8290690"," And you might get some you might get people trying to get out of their loans."
"8291230","8292690"," Oh yeah look at that move higher."
"8294670","8296410"," Just trapping them bears in there. "
"8297410","8298790"," Just trapping bears in there."
"8300910","8302670"," Coming into the top of the hour now."
"8304709","8306469"," Sideways action for the last half hour. "
"8307670","8310570"," All these bears are loaded up on Tesla puts right now."
"8312590","8315910"," I think I'm going to go to another I'm going to take a break here for what I was talking"
"8315910","8316230"," about."
"8316750","8318430"," You're going to take a look around the market right here. "
"8325049","8327330"," Oh yeah we get that five minute coming up right now."
"8328370","8330110"," We just got that five minute candle."
"8339500","8343860"," I'm long I'm long 10 right now on three or four or two C."
"8346020","8348240"," I'm long spine for four two C."
"8355100","8357580"," Getting carried away now watching what I'm doing here. "
"8363240","8365379"," You know I think what Jimmy is saying is."
"8365860","8371780"," So I think that's what that's what that's what Janet Yellen had thought back in the GFC was."
"8372360","8377340"," You might see some people lose their homes because they've got bad debt. "
"8377559","8380760"," You might see other people hold on to their homes and weather the storm."
"8382559","8387459"," The question becomes does it happen to two thirds of the people or just a third of the people."
"8389400","8391340"," A few things haven't happened. "
"8391480","8394920"," We haven't had unemployment raised yet high enough to kick people out."
"8396160","8398080"," We know that we haven't had that."
"8398300","8400320"," People are working their asses off right now. "
"8402360","8410220"," We haven't seen we haven't seen as many people with bad debt that you'd expect to have bad debt."
"8410660","8417000"," It's almost like that the COVID payments was life changing for some people."
"8417900","8424120"," So I guess what you need the fed to do would be to if you wanted that Jimmy Barry situation"
"8424120","8426220"," or you'd want. "
"8428760","8435660"," Or be it Jimmy Barry situation you'd want to have unemployment go to the roof and you'd want taxes"
"8435660","8438360"," on individuals of the county the state."
"8438860","8442200"," And the federal level would go to the roof on individuals."
"8442800","8448380"," You'd want to see a higher you have your yelling saying she wants to reinvent the tax code. "
"8448660","8451900"," The IRS revamped the IRS I would my assumption would be then that."
"8452480","8454260"," That would be the only way for you to do it right."
"8454260","8458530"," I think that they. "
"8460450","8465110"," My thought is that these people not all of them but a good percentage of them."
"8465970","8467290"," Probably didn't tell you."
"8468170","8469950"," But they took the money during COVID. "
"8470810","8473030"," They might be Republican bitching about it."
"8473790","8475850"," But they might have taken the money is my point."
"8476950","8480450"," And you know some of them went out and bought F one 50s or F two 50s but then a"
"8480450","8486190"," whole bunch from probably didn't. "
"8486190","8487950"," I don't know how you get the money out of those people's hands."
"8489070","8492090"," You know even if even if eggs are high and milk is high and all that kind of stuff."
"8493570","8495050"," It's the only way that I could see it happening. "
"8498030","8500030"," Yeah recession is you're never losing his job."
"8503590","8504390"," Love being town."
"8512170","8512890"," You shouldn't. "
"8513750","8517450"," Shouldn't borrow more than four times a year and majority of people have brought 10 to 15 times"
"8517450","8517710"," there."
"8518430","8519850"," That's a fair point Jimmy."
"8520670","8521450"," I can give you that. "
"8521830","8522770"," That's a fair point."
"8522770","8525450"," Young people today are getting fucked right up the gate."
"8528980","8530360"," I believe in that Jimmy. "
"8531060","8535940"," My own daughter is 15 years old years old right now."
"8536680","8538140"," I don't know what to tell her."
"8541180","8545320"," I'm trying to talk about how much money she has to make and how she she doesn't want to take"
"8545320","8546240"," on that school debt. "
"8546600","8551140"," The amount of debt that she's going to have to take on and then what she has to make guaranteed"
"8551140","8551880"," out of college."
"8554970","8559670"," I'm super fearful for her taking on any kind of bad credit card debt and that kind of shit that"
"8559670","8560930"," these kids get roped into."
"8562110","8566150"," And then the inflation for an older person is nothing compared to a young person. "
"8567450","8568630"," For the impact of inflation."
"8573410","8577130"," You think it could possibly be in the young kids that are bringing on the collapse."
"8585280","8590800"," Yeah non-traditional cheaper right you can declare yourself independent rep but don't then don't"
"8590800","8591640"," you take on the loans. "

"12211490","12218210"," Price started to have for today is a 403 flat, but you know 403 and change 403 64. "
"12220390","12221750"," We did get a new high here."
"12221910","12222710"," So I am bullish here."
"12224290","12232130"," Actually, I said, take the money and run on Tesla, but Tesla was able to get a new high as"
"12232130","12232290"," well. "
"12232410","12238750"," They're now trading 144.91. There should be some, there should be some sellers right at 145 flat."
"12239290","12243810"," But it wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised to see Tesla try to attack 150 today."
"12244430","12247170"," It's possible into the bell that we get 150 on Tesla. "
"12247550","12255710"," But just be aware that algorithms will sell flat numbers like 140, 150, 145, 150 stuff like that."
"12256810","12262670"," And us being in trend day, I'm looking for this green line to get bought down below."
"12264350","12267050"," So we'll see what happens as we come up to 145. "
"12268550","12270270"," Just blast it right into it."
"12270370","12272310"," 145 10 on Tesla right now."
"12273450","12276750"," Then the upper price price range 150. "
"12279630","12281530"," Look at Tesla just go."
"12283750","12286810"," Tesla's just just man handling shorts right now."
"12287590","12293230"," 145 20 on Tesla right now cutting through 145 like it's butter right now. "
"12294610","12295730"," Holy shit."
"12296950","12298290"," I want to go on break here."
"12298370","12302430"," And I'm like, how the fuck do I go and break when Tesla's going to the moon?"
"12305010","12306750"," 145 20 on Tesla. "
"12307630","12309910"," Just squeezing out shorts right now."
"12310830","12312610"," Next stop 150 on Tesla."
"12316730","12325350"," Fuck in a Tesla in straight beast mode. "
"12330550","12331730"," Straight beast mode."
"12332270","12334090"," Let's see if Tesla can get 150 today."
"12346760","12347560"," All right, I'll be back. "
"12349800","12351580"," Yeah, please like and subscribe these videos."
"12351840","12352100"," They're free."
"12352500","12353480"," Put them out every day for you. "
"12356280","12358820"," Man, see now I want to buy this green line right here."
"12363840","12365920"," Let me see if I can get some shit tickets here."
"12366980","12368560"," Some lotos for the clothes. "
"12392060","12394300"," We're gonna break an apple right now."
"12394380","12395480"," I wouldn't be buying anything here."
"12397760","12407740"," Apple's looking for 139.96. Oh, fuck"
"12407740","12407940"," it. "
"12422790","12425290"," Let's take a look at Spy real quick."
"12430140","12430920"," Hold on here."
"12431660","12434780"," Just in case we got a rollover before I take a break here. "
"12437440","12437880"," Nope."
"12438880","12439740"," No, come on now."
"12442360","12443840"," Just be careful here, okay. "
"12444460","12448140"," I want you to see Spy here."
"12448360","12455300"," If you don't want to see this break here, I want you to look at Spy right now."
"12456680","12458900"," 395.91, okay. "
"12459980","12465260"," If this trend breaks here, if this green line right here, if we break the screen line and we start"
"12465260","12468580"," to sell underneath it, see any nonsense like this."
"12468580","12471140"," So far Senate will publish the need."
"12471240","12475030"," I'm gonna say that we want people. "
"12477670","12479230"," You don't want to see this right here."
"12480350","12482510"," 396 is a price target down below."
"12483730","12484750"," You don't want to see that. "
"12486710","12488230"," If you're a bear, you want to see that."
"12488610","12490390"," You want to see us break trend in here, right?"
"12491050","12492330"," Right now we're trading trend."
"12494250","12494890"," Let's see. "
"12494990","12495990"," Keep your eyes on it."
"12498470","12501330"," We'll look at Apple next and see if it's break and trend."
"12502910","12504110"," Be warned right here. "
"12505490","12507070"," Don't like seeing this right here."
"12507130","12508630"," Break below the one in five minute."
"12508850","12516190"," It can trade down to 138.34. The bulls need to hold this line here. "
"12516490","12516750"," Definitely."
"12517170","12519990"," If they can't hold this, it could get nasty."
"12522270","12525190"," Keep your eyes on Apple here. "
"12534320","12539480"," 396, which is now above a bit more like right here."
"12549850","12551810"," Where's my price target right there?"
"12563040","12565060"," Where are they just killing options right now?"
"12567100","12568840"," Let me look at option pricing here."
"12586740","12588840"," Bear is looking for a role in the market here. "
"12601140","12610960"," All right, give me like, give me just, pull out a second"
"12610960","12611220"," here."
"12612480","12615040"," I'm going to draw out some boxes for the bears."
"12620170","12624250"," There's a box for the bears down here. "
"12624950","12625670"," What do I say?"
"12625710","12626850"," 396 down below."
"12642230","12650370"," All right, so I grabbed 403s, 403 Cs for the clothes here."
"12652870","12654470"," I'll be right back with you. "
"12654470","12685810"," Yeah, there's"
"12685810","12687050"," a nasty bull flag on Apple."
"12687230","12689690"," I just grabbed some, I grabbed some cheap ones."
"12690170","12693670"," I mean, the best place to buy calls are probably right here. "
"12695710","12696990"," They were fucking cheap."
"12697290","12700670"," So if we roll over here, I'll add to the position."
"12701590","12708930"," I'll add some more on, but this is my first start, like first place buy, second place buy. "
"12709630","12714050"," If it gets nasty down here, I'll cut myself loose out of the, out of the trade."
"12714570","12715650"," It's a risky fucking trade."
"12715810","12717130"," I wouldn't follow me in this trade at all. "
"12717970","12718470"," It's risky."
"12719070","12720730"," I'm going to walk away because I don't want to look at it."
"12721110","12723890"," If I keep looking at it, I'm going to, I'm going to fucking panic and sell. "
"12848860","12850420"," So I just left up the trigger."
"12851280","12852320"," You can watch that trigger."
"12854440","12858540"," And you can see where the PT is down below with the blue, with the green line there. "
"13612530","13614690"," I'm just going to pop in briefly with you right now."
"13617050","13620130"," Keep your eye on Tesla in the background."
"13622190","13624830"," See this 143-28. "
"13626050","13629570"," Probably put up like, you can put two screeners up right here."
"13630230","13633170"," You could do like one next to Tesla next to spy."
"13634330","13639070"," And you know, you could look towards maybe Tesla as a trigger for the spy. "
"13640210","13643050"," To either go long or for a break in spy."
"13644510","13646630"," Just keep an eye on Tesla here."
"13646790","13648590"," You could be saw some weakness here in Tesla. "
"13649010","13650610"," And if this is the Tesla chart, by the way."
"13651410","13653610"," So if you had like a, like a dual chart up."
"13655270","13659030"," If you had something like this here. "
"13660810","13663190"," And you did something like this right here."
"13663670","13666410"," Normally I was trading without you guys."
"13667150","13670390"," I would have like six screeners up all at once. "
"13670390","13672610"," I'd have all the sectors up."
"13673670","13675470"," I should do that one day with you guys."
"13675770","13676730"," I think I've done it in the past. "
"13678410","13681090"," But here's like a, here's a spy screen."
"13681210","13682610"," Normally I'd have like six screens up."
"13683910","13685530"," But here's a Tesla screener, right?"
"13686550","13688090"," So let's look at Tesla here. "
"13689670","13695590"," You see a break right now in spy, but you know, you could put, this is the spy, right?"
"13695790","13696230"," This is Tesla."
"13697530","13701390"," And you just be looking for what's weak right now in tech, maybe."
"13702350","13706150"," You know, if you see this come down, if you see this come down for a bounce. "
"13706990","13709550"," And let's say you saw some weakness here in spy."
"13710690","13713430"," You know, you're looking for that, that same kind of a bite."
"13713630","13714490"," Does that make sense to you?"
"13718190","13724550"," Sometimes I'll do NDX, sometimes I'll do Dixie and HYG, XLF, stuff, stuff like that. "
"13725970","13728650"," Vix, you could do, you know what I'm saying?"
"13729210","13730370"," Because they're not all matching up."
"13731050","13736830"," And you can kind of see it might give you a heads up as to where the market's going."
"13738870","13740230"," So spies below the green. "
"13741330","13743950"," Tesla's got a little bit of a little bit of consolidation to do here."
"13755540","13757740"," So where spy looks weak on its own."
"13759400","13762940"," You still haven't seen a break of Tesla yet, my point. "
"13777070","13778330"," I'll be back in a little bit again."
"13886100","13890940"," You know, another example would be if you're watching, yeah, you're watching how weak Tesla are,"
"13891100","13892020"," spy looks right now."
"13893720","13896880"," On your own, you could do Apple, right?"
"13897120","13903380"," So you could do like spies looking pretty weak right here, right?"
"13905740","13908200"," You could do Apple side by side. "
"13929490","13933150"," Let's get rid of this line so that you can actually see it better."
"13938780","13941000"," Apple hasn't really given it up yet, has it?"
"13941360","13941660"," See that?"
"13941920","13943460"," See how Apple hasn't given it up yet?"
"13944740","13947820"," You want to see Apple give it up for spy to give it up, right?"
"14079910","14080950"," All right."
"14080950","14147300"," All right, so"
"14147300","14149220"," not seeing Apple give it up down here. "
"14149420","14151120"," First price target hit down below."
"14153700","14162540"," I'm going to get rid of the dual, almost the perfect hit down below."
"14171020","14174220"," Large concentration on 402 C's. "
"14174480","14179060"," They were 22 cents there for a minute, 22 cents for 402 C."
"14179940","14182220"," There's 300,000 contracts on it."
"14186040","14191700"," If you want to be bearish here, you're going to be looking for a rejection right up here."
"14191880","14195640"," You want to see if you're a bear, you want to see some rejection for the next low. "
"14196260","14203840"," That would be up here, and then a continuation lower down to next target below is 396."
"14210590","14211530"," 395."
"14212090","14212970"," 86. "
"14216290","14217230"," 385."
"14217410","14219370"," 86 right here."
"14221500","14240140"," MX diesel"
"14240140","14243800"," February futures, that's $3.55 a gallon. "
"14244180","14252140"," NIMEX natural gas February futures, that's $3.44. NIMEX gasoline February futures, that's $2.69 a"
"14252140","14252780"," gallon."
"14261380","14263120"," You guys all see that there."
"14271220","14281510"," NIMEX WTI crude March futures, that's"
"14281510","14284710"," $81.62 a barrel. "
"14287090","14306470"," That's down 2 cents, or 0.02%. You"
"14306470","14309710"," want to see this hold right here for continuation down farther."
"14310950","14314190"," Next price target down below $3.95. 86."
"14315110","14316450"," I don't think it goes down there. "
"14316550","14324610"," I think this is just an opportunity to buy calls, but we've got 402 C's, 314,000."
"14326350","14331550"," I was thinking about adding to 403 C's, but I think I might add to 402 C."
"14342060","14343340"," I've got them set up here."
"14351550","14357330"," What I would like to see to add would be if we go here, if we trade higher and hold"
"14357330","14362450"," this, I'm going to take the calls right there for this movement of the bell. "
"14364250","14366530"," You remember January 11th, what I talked to you about?"
"14366730","14369130"," You'll end up seeing this weakness in the market later in the day."
"14370610","14372790"," Don't take profit on each level."
"14372930","14379070"," If you're a bear, what you do is you take the trade down right, and you wait for the rejection"
"14379070","14379510"," above. "
"14381010","14385030"," If we get underneath here, that's where the trade is, right?"
"14385310","14385830"," Right here."
"14385990","14388130"," That's where the meat of the trade is for the next leg."
"14388990","14390870"," Don't get caught in here for the next leg. "
"14396200","14399100"," Wait for the squeeze higher, and then the rejection to come lower."
"14400940","14421490"," If you're bearish, this is"
"14421490","14422390"," what you want right here."
"14422530","14424650"," This big yellow line, you want to break under here. "
"14426430","14428930"," You don't care if we squeeze up and get underneath it."
"14431190","14434790"," You don't care if we get underneath it and squeeze and push lower."
"14437770","14439730"," This yellow line right here. "
"14456370","14458670"," CSM Jazz is like, pull that fucking rug."
"14460690","14461550"," Too funny."
"14471150","14473450"," Yeah, it still hasn't given it up yet, though. "
"14473790","14476630"," I mean, that's my thing is Apple still hasn't given it up."
"14478070","14480450"," Like you want to see the fat lady singing here."
"14482050","14484010"," That's why I'm not bearish here yet. "
"14484230","14487690"," You really want to see, you want to see like one of two things happen."
"14487910","14492690"," You want to see the squeeze and then get underneath it to get lower."
"14492690","14497770"," Or at least the break and then the rejection to go lower. "
"14499470","14501270"," I haven't seen that yet on Apple."
"14501490","14502250"," I'm watching it."
"14502830","14507500"," I haven't seen it yet. "
"14515970","14517930"," Wait, this is a juicy trade right here."
"14518210","14520270"," I mean, if you get this trade right here, it's a banging trade."
"14521630","14522770"," There's a bunch of money in here. "
"14549210","14559210"," I'm going to just, I'm going to look at something we're going"
"14559210","14561610"," to go over real quick for before we get going here."
"14564370","14566430"," You probably got to see a squeeze here."
"14567530","14570150"," We're just going to go over some before we go to the end of the day here. "
"14571870","14573050"," Don't get mad at me."
"14578960","14582200"," Okay, I'm probably going to take another quick break, but I'll get mad at me."
"14582300","14585320"," I just wanted to show you guys this because some of you guys are relying upon this stuff. "
"14592740","14598540"," Okay, so into, we're going to look, we got Monday."
"14600760","14601800"," It is earnings week."
"14602000","14603060"," So we're going to go over this real quick. "
"14604700","14605700"," It is earnings week."

"14639900","14641960"," Talk about lopsided options, right?"
"14642240","14649100"," L-T-C-H, lopsided options, pole, and then comms."
"14649560","14653000"," Look at that, 33, you can just short this shit."
"14653400","14656300"," Find out which side everybody's on and take the other side of these trades. "
"14657220","14657700"," Ridiculous."
"14658260","14659960"," And then we'll look at tomorrow's."
"14661380","14663560"," And I'll go right back to spy here in just a minute. "
"14663560","14666800"," So Microsoft is reporting after the bell tomorrow."

"14708930","14711570"," strangle, but a straddle on these, and they can print."
"14712650","14715510"," You can always look these up and come back and pause the program."
"14719410","14722210"," A bunch of financial banks and shit, right?"

"18385170","18389490"," you got no one big push up one big push you're going to hear people you're going to hear people"
"18389490","18395250"," say it's the three day candle right that's they're going to tell you say it's one i'm not anti this"
"18395250","18401390"," uh take in the market you get one day two days they're going to tell you that it's going to"
"18401390","18410930"," rip into tomorrow that's okay i don't need it i'll catch it i'll catch it tomorrow if we get this"
"18410930","18419810"," big rip here uh we're in positive gamma right now so i'm going to expect you i'm i'm not anti"
"18419810","18424230"," like going up into like the six o'clock hour i'd like to i really like to see us come"
"18424230","18435530"," down i really like to have a buying opportunity down in here either Tuesday or Wednesday bears"
"18435530","18442630"," you got some work to do right put spreads if you got them on friday they're probably still safe"
"18442630","18448470"," right now if you got put spreads on friday some protection or if you got a hedge in the market"
"18448470","18452350"," now we've had a we've had somewhat of a change in the market so what i would say to you"
"18452350","18459590"," is uh if we come up and down then you have a chance if this dip gets bought down here"
"18459590","18466390"," anywhere in here like anywhere in here this dip gets bought uh you might want to reset your hedge"
"18466390","18472130"," for above well you're probably hoping for that if you're in a hedge right now or hopefully your"
"18472130","18479270"," hedge is built to sell 406 at some point we'll be revisiting down here some point down the road uh"
"18479270","18485450"," so you at least have some time here don't go get all panicky or whatever that's my take for the"

"18513890","18520550"," a dip to buy down here 395 to 390ish somewhere in here you don't want to give up ask one"
"18520550","18527530"," uh to be somewhere down in here as i'm looking for for friday uh i got some some dead calls"
