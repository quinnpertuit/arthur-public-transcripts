"41350","42230"," Good morning."
"44270","45290"," Just a minute here."
"45410","45570"," I got. "
"50130","52330"," Had a forced update this morning."
"63480","64800"," Switch right over here."
"64840","65080"," Hold on. "
"66060","68340"," Okay, so good morning to you out there."
"68800","70300"," Hope you all had a good night last night."
"71780","73760"," We have a few topics to go over this one. "
"73880","74660"," I'm a little bit late here."
"75300","82580"," I had my is really weird to have got a forced update this morning and it's kind of changing what's"
"82580","84300"," going on."
"85080","87960"," Let me mute book map here for a minute for you. "
"88900","93620"," Okay, so take a look at the market right here."
"94440","96020"," So we have a previous low."
"96460","101660"," I was going to post this this morning and then I was falling a little bit behind, but I want"
"101660","105040"," to show you three ninety eight over here. "
"108930","110870"," This is a kind of an important level today."
"111730","118070"," So right over here, you can see this is the previous low here three ninety eight seventeen."
"119650","122070"," And you kind of want to be looking for this. "
"122290","124210"," There's kind of two zones you're looking for here."
"124850","134580"," You're looking for kind of a box right here as a pretty"
"134580","135280"," large pivot."
"136540","139620"," And then this previous high. "
"141260","143560"," Yeah, or excuse me, previous low."
"144500","146100"," Change that up here a little bit."
"148860","151220"," You want to be looking for this retest here. "
"152760","155880"," To get this retest going on on the open right."
"156060","158300"," This would be this would be normal to see a retest here."
"159120","161020"," Testing the previous day is lows. "
"162060","166660"," And then from here, you're looking for a rejection above for lower lows."
"167400","170600"," This is kind of a major, a major kind of a thing right here for bears."
"171800","175080"," They need to like kind of, well, they want to test the major lows here. "
"175380","180340"," Now, if we immediately start breaking through or driving through down here, this is uber, uber"
"180340","180880"," bearish."
"180880","185460"," If we break through this retest, you could definitely put some puts on here."
"185980","188280"," If we break through right here, if we break through right here, if we break through right here, if"
"188280","188280"," we break through right here. "
"188300","194320"," If we don't break through right here, the next attempt for bears is going to be up somewhere up"
"194320","195800"," here at that pivot point."
"196000","197620"," That's 200 SMA."
"198280","199520"," Now for this break lower. "
"200240","203640"," Now, then on the third, there's a third option here."
"204200","207500"," So, you know, this break below down here, right?"
"207720","213660"," And this confirmation, if we're able to break through right here, even if we come back up, it still"
"213660","215520"," opens the door for bears."
"215940","220640"," But we'll look at this on a larger time frame here so that you can see the, well, the point"
"220640","228080"," that I was trying to make this morning, well, I guess did I get rid of it?"
"229060","232100"," So you can see that just this 200 MA right here. "
"233360","235620"," Bears really want to be breaking through this."
"235880","236920"," What do we got going on here?"
"237560","238340"," This is all wrong."
"241180","247660"," We need to get our stuff, all these stupid right here, somewhere right up here. "
"250600","255579"," And you can kind of see that, I want you to see this, these bears get real technical."
"256940","259540"," So see this right here, this yellow line right here."
"259600","264120"," They're trying to break through this, not just the retest of the previous low, but at least push"
"264120","264500"," through. "
"264500","272100"," I made a post on one regular Twitter that you wanted to kind of see this break below this channel"
"272100","272360"," here."
"272620","279700"," It's a, it's a, like a hal 9000 kind of a thing where if you breach, I don't know where"
"279700","280280"," this is here."
"281200","283160"," I think they got the breach this morning or more. "
"283800","287320"," It depends on the, yeah, they got that nice breach this morning."
"287320","288140"," You can see it yesterday."
"288220","292180"," They didn't kind of see they didn't get the breach yesterday. "
"292180","294120"," And they're getting the breach right now."
"294180","296080"," They really want this today."
"296560","299860"," And this, this doesn't really matter if we continue down today. "
"300100","302420"," If we don't, or do it doesn't really matter."
"302900","308040"," Just the technical breach of this, of this larger channel is important for bears."
"309640","315440"," I don't know where the fuck it is exactly here, but it's close enough that it's been breached. "
"316100","323700"," Oftentimes you'll see a breach of one of these of a trend and then you're either going to see two"
"323700","324260"," things here."
"324340","327180"," You're either going to see the breach."
"329810","333190"," And we'll revisit it down the road and you'll see a bloodbath. "
"335820","340960"," If you don't see the bloodbath down the road, you'll typically see the retracement and then we want"
"340960","343900"," to slam back down and we start off to the races."
"343900","350680"," The neat part about this is, this is kind of like the last, yeah, you got like one or two"
"350680","356880"," more chances for bulls, but other than that, this breach right here definitely signifies, you know,"
"356900","357840"," you get the break yesterday."
"358280","363120"," We had the break of the, of the pivot point yesterday, the 200 ma yesterday got broken. "
"363980","368780"," And I think there was one other key, key indicator that got broken yesterday's like two or three"
"368780","371160"," uber bearish events that took place here."
"372300","373960"," We also talked about last night."
"374180","379640"," Can we have that, that, that trick move in the overnight where we blast down and then open up for"
"379640","380160"," a move higher. "
"381700","383580"," And we're having it right on the opening bell."
"383720","384600"," We didn't get it in the overnight."
"384720","387480"," We're getting it right now in the open at the open this morning. "
"388720","390760"," And so this is kind of a key moment for bears."
"390900","393040"," They want to hold this for the rest of the day."
"393060","397260"," This is kind of signifies the end regardless if it's today. "
"398320","406820"," Regardless if it's next week or the week after this is most certainly technical break that bears"
"406820","407240"," needed."
"408420","410140"," Let me see if I can bring this back here."
"413310","420550"," This is most certainly a technical break that bears needed here to open the doorway to to the meat"
"420550","422530"," of the trade for bears bears need. "
"422530","426630"," You know, you've got this, let me get brings to the larger timeframe here."
"430560","435280"," If you've got a, if you've got like a major trades going out on the market, let me do a"
"435280","435920"," six month here."
"440890","445170"," When you have like, when you have major down moves in a market, you want some confirmation that"
"445170","446090"," we're heading this way, you know?"
"446710","448130"," This is a huge trade right here, right?"
"448270","454450"," These are giant trades, giant trade here, and then a further giant trade down right here. "
"454570","462970"," So when you want to unlock this door, you want to unlock this door to come down to lower lows,"
"463770","467590"," and that's regardless of, well, give me a second here."
"471010","473610"," We're going to delete this in a minute, but I'm just going to want to put it here."
"474370","477510"," You know, this opens doors to retest this level right here. "
"477950","483550"," It opens up another door to retest the lows that we have down here, right?"
"483550","485290"," It's going to be red down here, I guess."
"486930","491230"," And believe it or not, but not believe it or not, but to want to go lower."
"491910","498330"," You've got this level here, this level here and, you know, if you break this, if you break this,"
"498330","503170"," this trend that we have, even if it's just briefly, it doesn't really matter. "
"503370","504330"," You've broken below it."
"504770","511750"," You're now looking for some major low, some major low tests here, here, and the bears really want"
"511750","512850"," something down here."
"512850","518730"," This is that 3,200, we've got the 3,500 tests here and 3,200 here. "
"519289","523930"," It doesn't matter how long it takes to get here, but once the key is in there, that's it."
"524170","530290"," You're, you've kind of, I mean, it really, at really that point, the bull-like argument to go"
"530290","532350"," higher is kind of out the window at this point."
"533290","538690"," There's no more onus, I guess there's no more onus on the bears anymore to say, hey, we're heading"
"538690","539050"," lower. "
"539050","545910"," The onus now shifts with that break this morning to bulls to say, yeah, well, you know, fuck you,"
"545970","546430"," this is fake."
"547110","548850"," This is just an extreme bottom."
"548850","550310"," I'm going to rip higher, that kind of stuff. "
"550650","553370"," So you're having a shift at this moment this morning."
"554250","557850"," This breach down below here of saying, nope, the door's open, the key's open."
"558290","560030"," We really don't give a fine fuck if it happens today. "
"560230","561790"," We really don't give a fine fuck if it happens tomorrow."
"562090","562970"," We really don't care."
"564050","565710"," Let me see if I can get to the monthly here. "
"566810","571290"," Bears at this point really don't care if we trade up to 415."
"571530","573130"," They have zero cares here."
"573550","580170"," This break this morning is an algorithm, or not only caught algorithm, but this is where a bank"
"580170","583290"," software, a bank computer program is coming below here. "
"583950","585090"," They call it opening the door."
"585210","588150"," As soon as that door is open, it doesn't matter where we trade up here."
"588150","595710"," The owners want to say this shift is the bulls don't have the ball in their court any longer. "
"596490","600690"," It's all about now positioning this trade down to lower lows."
"601550","604350"," So what we'll have to do is start getting out some targets."
"604370","607010"," I'm sure you guys have and you have the retest of 3500. "
"607350","609050"," We got 348 down here."
"609210","611150"," There's some more bullshit down here around."
"611530","614210"," You get this gap to close down here at 360 to 355. "
"614210","617790"," And then lower lows, 3200 certainly on the table."
"617990","627030"," You'll hear that with this break this morning that there's an opportunity for bears to get that"
"627030","627250"," low."
"627470","632870"," When we're trading down here, when we made this home, we bring this back. "
"637230","638610"," So you can see this."
"641190","643350"," You know, when we were down here, right?"
"643450","643990"," We had this rip."
"644190","647370"," I already came back down and we, you know, we had this this touchdown here. "
"648110","649930"," We had this nice higher bottom, right?"
"650030","654730"," This bottoming process that took place up here wasn't quite as low as it was before."
"655310","658590"," And this gave the bulls a chance, right?"
"658890","660150"," To say, hey, you know what?"
"660310","661530"," This might be a turn in the market."
"661990","665250"," And so you give the credence to the bulls and say, you know what?"
"665350","666830"," The fucking bulls are going to make this run up here. "
"666830","670730"," And they're definitely going to take an attempt to break out of this channel."
"671410","674510"," So you have to give the bulls this chance to break out of this channel."
"674770","679610"," The moment that they fail, right, which they did start to fail, but then this breach right here,"
"679610","683370"," this kind of says, yeah, we took this trip up to see if this was it. "
"683750","685170"," And we're being told no."
"685570","690590"," So the moment you're being told no, you have to then shift that, shift that thinking and say to"
"690590","692850"," yourself, okay, so let's start looking lower here."
"692850","695010"," We're being told no, it's not higher. "
"695330","697230"," It is lower than where it is lower."
"697430","700070"," And there are some huge lower numbers down below."
"700730","701490"," He huge. "
"702090","704090"," And this is what we talked about last week in the week."
"704350","706030"," I think I think every it's funny."
"706170","710930"," I think every week on this trip up here, I think we've had that conversation with. "
"712150","714370"," With a trade the levels here, right?"
"714630","721410"," Trade the level up as we come back down to trading levels because until this breaches, you can't"
"721410","724330"," start talking about how deep and how far it's going to go."
"724490","727650"," Once you do break though, it does open that door."
"727750","730870"," And this is where the meat of that down trade is. "
"731490","733430"," This is a huge trade available here."
"733830","735350"," And it's time to put the bear suit on."
"735430","739910"," It's time to start saying to yourself, okay, we're, we've got the bull suit on running up here. "
"740350","742230"," And we're going to take this bull suit to conclusion."
"743010","746110"," And now we're going to put the bear suit on and we're going to take it to conclusion."
"746110","750470"," And you have to give the bears this chance down here to go deep. "
"750750","752730"," I mean, I'm talking deep like you're talking."
"753030","756410"," I don't know what this, this, the number of points there here, but you're talking."
"756530","757750"," We're at 400 right now, right?"
"758930","762730"," And now you're talking at least 360, 365 minimum. "
"763930","765490"," You're looking for 3,200."
"766330","768730"," That would be fair to even put on the table."
"769270","770790"," So you're talking about a giant trade. "
"771050","772790"," That's like an 800 point trade down, right?"
"772790","780470"," It's huge, huge, huge, huge to take a trade with confidence down here."
"781450","781890"," Absolutely."
"782350","786770"," When you, when you get told, no, we're going up here and you get told, no, we're not going anywhere"
"786770","787410"," up here. "
"787790","790630"," This is how the market works on a larger timeframe, right?"
"791250","793690"," We go lower until we find demand, right?"
"794130","795270"," We find some demand, right?"
"795470","798430"," We ricochet back up and we go all the way up until we find some real supply."
"799330","805030"," The moment we find real supply, we had right back down looking for larger demand, right?"
"805190","806310"," Than the supply that was above."
"806950","809310"," These are all basic mechanics in our stock markets. "
"809590","813190"," When you see this stuff happen here, this is where the meat of the trade is."
"813290","817330"," This is where if a pair comes to me and says, hey, look, we're going to roll this market down."
"817490","818550"," We're going to go down to 3,200. "
"818850","819630"," We're going to go down to 2,400."
"819850","820570"," We're going to go to 2,400."
"821530","826110"," Right now is where you give the bears legit credence and say, you know what?"
"826190","827250"," I got to listen to this guy. "
"827250","833570"," I got to listen to this lady because they're technically making their point right now."
"833670","837190"," They're technically breaking trend as we speak currently."
"838650","845170"," Yeah, what does that mean for you as a taking this short hair, taking this short position?"
"847230","848410"," There's no rush. "
"849330","850450"," You can take it now."
"850510","851590"," You can put on a put position."
"851590","858870"," I would most certainly, I've got a, I like a triple lever just a down short. "
"859070","859550"," That's for March."
"862230","864370"," But you could take that short hair."
"864630","865350"," You could take it. "
"865530","867910"," I mean, we could bloodbath it down and still come back up."
"868070","869270"," And you have an opportunity has been point."
"869930","872170"," You could be like, don't fuck that cap and get it right now. "
"872650","874150"," I would get this trade."
"875870","880970"," At some point in the next, I don't know, today into end of month."
"880970","886350"," Grab yourself a beautiful put position. "
"886530","892270"," You could get a put that's dated for six months from now that you hold until until March."
"892950","896490"," You could get a put that's a put spread dated into March."
"897330","903290"," You can hold it into April just in case they try to burn all a deep low, right?"
"903890","905330"," Let's say like I want 3200 cap. "
"905810","906470"," Get it for April."
"906610","907270"," Give it an extra month."
"908290","911790"," Just in case there's some fuckery for us getting there, right?"
"912750","917110"," But throw something on at this point for this market that's going to print for you. "
"917850","920210"," Because this is telling you that we're breaking trend."
"920470","925650"," There's a few other brief moments back here where they were like, nope, sorry."
"925750","926530"," It's like we're going up. "
"927630","930170"," This is a key break right here."
"930410","931450"," Key, key, key."
"931910","933470"," This is what bears want to see. "
"933650","934790"," This is constructive for bears."
"935450","937830"," This is showing the turn, right?"
"938670","941850"," Absolute, perfect, beautiful rolling the market over."
"942930","945070"," So start to consider that trade. "
"945210","947470"," This is the same setup as down below."
"948350","956070"," If you're a bull out there and you're looking for some constructive moves for bottoms down here,"
"956270","956290"," right?"
"956710","958610"," The bears just did it on the top up here."
"958750","961710"," And there's plenty of meat on that trade heading down. "
"961710","964190"," I would not stare at that trade every day."
"965170","970330"," If you don't have another brokerage or another account with your brokerage, you place that trade."
"971430","972770"," You don't look at it. "
"973470","974430"," Don't look at it."
"974510","975290"," Don't check on it."
"976010","979270"," You're looking to be checking on that trade the first time. "
"980290","985130"," Way down here, like 385, 380, and then down here at 360."
"985630","990530"," I'll post some numbers for you for some sign posts as we make our way down."
"991630","998310"," If you ask me where we're going down here, I think initially on a confirmation roll, you're"
"998310","1003690"," definitely looking for, you're definitely looking for, I would, if you said to me, take up, I"
"1003690","1005970"," think, 350, 360 is on board. "
"1006730","1009570"," I think 335, I think 3,200 is on board."
"1009710","1013130"," I don't think that's unreasonable for where we are right now."
"1013890","1019250"," As we get closer, you can take profit, reenter, take profit, reenter, and trade the levels as we"
"1019250","1019550"," get closer. "
"1019550","1020790"," But absolutely."
"1021310","1023069"," And there's this one right here, right?"
"1023230","1028109"," There's levels to break and for you to check as we head down."
"1028670","1034390"," But without a doubt, if a bear says to me, we're going to 3,200, like last week before, no"
"1034390","1034869"," credence. "
"1036210","1043109"," Today, they have most certainly made the case for breaking trend, most certainly made the case for"
"1043109","1045430"," any kind of nastiness down here."
"1045829","1048030"," Now, do I think a bear is a case for like 2,400?"
"1048030","1048930"," Fuck no."
"1050110","1052190"," This is the meat of the trade somewhere in here. "
"1055330","1059050"," You only need to capture, you know, some of this right here is beautiful."
"1060010","1062790"," And then start trading level to level as we get down here, right?"
"1064870","1067770"," Same as any kind of a move like this, right?"
"1068630","1073430"," And then if we break through here and get down to the 20s or get down to the 1600s or"
"1073430","1075270"," any of that kind of stuff, I'm all for it."
"1075270","1079450"," The sooner the truth is, I don't think we get down here. "
"1080550","1084030"," These don't do the timing is right, but the sooner we get down there, the sooner we get down to"
"1084030","1086210"," like 1600, 2400."
"1087390","1094210"," I don't think 3,200 maybe, but anywhere down in here, you're going to see a QT end, you're going"
"1094210","1097350"," to see a bottom actually you put in the market."
"1098730","1100730"," And we'll track this as it goes along. "
"1100730","1102810"," We don't want to see this for 2023, right?"
"1103270","1104550"," That's that sideways trade."
"1106630","1114030"," There's a lot of agreement out there that will have a sideways trade until we actually get economic"
"1114030","1116950"," conditions to be similar or we've broken something."
"1117850","1118390"," This is a brutal. "
"1118670","1119230"," It's not a brutal trade."
"1119370","1125410"," It's a really good trade, but it'd be better if you're a bull to get a bottom that you can"
"1125410","1126130"," trade off of."
"1126830","1132350"," You can get rates will come off, you get some QE and the market can continue on. "
"1132610","1140610"," So this is very productive for bears, very productive for at least some lower targets with a juicy,"
"1140910","1142290"," juicy trade coming out."
"1148530","1150350"," So they can bring this up for you."
"1154840","1156980"," 51 spot for 51 spot for. "
"1159060","1161300"," I heard saw someone comment last night."
"1161420","1162860"," They said I saw someone comment."
"1163260","1167060"," I'm happy that we're selling off into the FOMC. "
"1167060","1171040"," If we weren't selling off an FOMC, I would be concerned."
"1171900","1177260"," So there are bulls out there still saying, Nope, that this is this all has to do with some kind"
"1177260","1178940"," of a rip coming into the FOMC meeting."
"1178940","1179880"," I'd be open to that. "
"1180000","1181420"," I'd be open to that, but I still am."
"1181820","1183420"," This breach down below here."
"1183560","1189980"," This today, most certainly lends credence to the bear case. "
"1194400","1195520"," Hang on just a second here."
"1195520","1198980"," And that would be conscience of that."
"1199140","1202300"," Even a rip off of the FOMC meeting. "
"1203060","1206980"," This this door has been breached down below that bears have it all."
"1207340","1208340"," It's all on their court."
"1208360","1209200"," Now they own the ball. "
"1209500","1217240"," This is all on them to take and ride down over the car."
"1217400","1222240"," I would say into at least March, if not January, January is like the January is the aggressive"
"1222240","1223060"," approach to it."
"1223060","1227840"," You're going to see some kind of market bottom or debt or debt or like some depth to a market"
"1227840","1228180"," bottom. "
"1229740","1235220"," In January, the safest trade is probably at least two more months out."
"1238580","1244500"," It leaves some time for for what I don't know what you call it like a fuckery or something."
"1244500","1250380"," As a matter of fact, you can see stuff like that. "
"1255660","1259240"," We can see that same kind of you can see that same kind of like I don't want to call"
"1259240","1259920"," it fuckery, but."
"1261480","1263640"," You know, stuff like this is wild, right?"
"1264700","1269480"," Especially if you're you're a bull up here and you get a bloodbath and then it's back up like this."
"1269520","1272620"," You'll see similar stuff like this, right?"
"1274420","1276340"," On the same way and the way back down here. "
"1276500","1280140"," So put some extra time on so that you don't have to worry about moves like this, right?"
"1280620","1284400"," If you're a bearish, you don't want to have to be like if we're going down here, let's say you"
"1284400","1285780"," see some giant rip higher."
"1285820","1287280"," You don't want to have to worry about that stuff."
"1287320","1291700"," You want your put position to just kind of grow as we head down over time. "
"1306440","1310580"," But the I'll go that I have is finally so right where we are right now that I'll go is"
"1310580","1313940"," finally starting to rule itself over right now."
"1313940","1315760"," So breaking some key levels."
"1335480","1340040"," We have posted out the Canadian IV PMI report on the website for anyone. "
"1340180","1340860"," Just a second here."
"1340860","1341620"," I'm checking this out go."
"1349100","1352640"," So it's affecting the smaller time frames, but not the larger time frames. "
"1377600","1382060"," The more the crazy part is the more that it sells off, the more that it wants to come back"
"1382060","1382640"," to VWAP."
"1384020","1386160"," It's like demanding a trip higher to VWAP."
"1390500","1392240"," Alright, let's see what you guys are saying this morning. "
"1395140","1396580"," Let's start at the top here."

"1452840","1455200"," Alright, so let's go through and see if you guys are posting this morning."
"1455240","1455940"," I'll start at the top."
"1457000","1458840"," I think you just looked below Friday's low. "
"1459520","1460100"," Yes sir."
"1460760","1463920"," Morning I was frantically refreshing to see if live."
"1465480","1468200"," Gun to my head to buy our calls and now I have to sell my home. "
"1469400","1470960"," Just broke below previous date."
"1471280","1472860"," Alright, so you guys are already noticing this stuff."
"1472860","1477980"," Good to see that you guys are already looking for previous lows and stuff like that. "
"1478080","1479320"," This is definitely bearish."
"1480280","1483360"," Nothing at all about this is bullish in any way shape or form."
"1486440","1488560"," Now you don't want to buy puts when this shit is down again. "
"1488760","1493400"," Needs to be done in any pump relief or soonish, but out of time that's Chase Winter saying that."
"1494640","1498480"," Oh shit, so I've got, let me take a look at my position here."
"1500920","1502780"," I've got, I still have them. "
"1502780","1504000"," It was a small position."
"1504080","1505080"," It was only five contracts."
"1506960","1509200"," We were, we actually stayed late yesterday. "
"1509400","1515760"," They were up to 63 cents at like 4.12. And everyone was saying, some, some, some, some, some."
"1517800","1520100"," So 4.02s, they're worth nine cents right now."
"1520760","1527900"," And there's 71,000 contracts on 400 C right now for 24 cents. "
"1530200","1532340"," I didn't take a large position in the belly yesterday."
"1533200","1536660"," We were kind of expecting one of two things happen here."
"1536760","1539320"," So we're actually expecting some kind of a pump off this. "
"1539840","1542060"," And I was expecting the bloodbath in the overnight."
"1542680","1546680"," I thought we'd get something like, I thought we'd get something like this."
"1547720","1549120"," I think it was down here, right?"
"1549340","1550920"," You get the one quick rip down. "
"1551560","1553860"," The banks would pack it up and we'd blast off today."
"1554440","1556840"," So I was, I was hoping for this kind of a move up."
"1557300","1562960"," And then to, and then, and then this morning to buy this opening bell, but you could see this"
"1562960","1564320"," morning we were right there, right?"
"1565320","1567060"," So I haven't bought anything at this point. "
"1567220","1568000"," No puts, no nothing."
"1568180","1573700"," I'm still flat except for, I've got five contracts on 400 and two C."
"1574340","1580380"," And then I've got a fucking shit ton of contracts on triple leverage dial for March."
"1580720","1582460"," That's all, that's my only positions right now. "
"1586740","1589360"," We're still trading lower right here, breaking below S1."
"1603480","1605480"," I'm taking a look here to see how low it will go."
"1611490","1614170"," Just grinding lower and lower and lower. "
"1614750","1617210"," This is a good sign bears."
"1617850","1619550"," This is the day right here."
"1619850","1628730"," If you thought this was the day or the move, we had puts, let me unmute this here. "
"1634620","1638000"," I think we shorted this back here or something, had some puts back here."
"1638000","1640100"," Same thing, no, no, wait a minute."
"1640140","1641440"," I think we took this one right here. "
"1642460","1646760"," I think we took this put position right in here, closed them out."
"1647320","1649560"," And then we were coming in here on Friday."
"1650100","1655580"," I told you I wanted to see a constructive down move. "
"1656600","1660300"," Monday, Tuesday, I think I said, and we're on Tuesday right now."
"1660520","1662400"," This is not constructive at all."
"1663080","1666280"," This is instead of just, hey, let's have some constructive bears. "
"1666280","1668080"," They're saying, fuck you, no, we're taking our chance."
"1668680","1669660"," We're blasting through."
"1670140","1673560"," You can see that this is a huge move for bears in here. "
"1674380","1679180"," As a matter of fact, I took a small call position for a rip higher."
"1679320","1684600"," I'm going to be taking one again down here, see if I can buy a dip for a trip back"
"1684600","1685640"," to close some shit above."
"1685940","1690180"," The Japan cool race borrowing costs again, but interest rates are now very clearly level. "
"1690600","1693100"," The monetary policy is neither expuntering nor restricted."
"1695180","1696600"," Well, we're almost there, I think."
"1696900","1697540"," So we'll see what happens. "
"1704360","1705500"," Huge move down."
"1705660","1709100"," Look at that bloodbath in this morning, outstanding for the bears."
"1712590","1714270"," I was I was watching it. "
"1714430","1719070"," So last night I turned on YouTube and I was watching all these YouTube videos."
"1719570","1722370"," I didn't watch like the whole thing, but I watched a ton of you."
"1722570","1724370"," Like I would go to the screener and turn it on. "
"1725470","1730890"," And then I went through their history and their entire history was like a like a two months of"
"1730890","1733070"," calling for market crashes."
"1734730","1737390"," And of course they didn't get it for two straight months."
"1737630","1742070"," I'm telling you it's like it's like if I make this one last video, we're going to get our market"
"1742070","1742430"," crash. "
"1744070","1745610"," I'm going to grab some calls here."
"1755760","1757280"," So I'm going to add to some position."
"1757560","1762260"," I'm going to move I'm moving up from four or two to 400 C."
"1763840","1765980"," We'll see if any of this pays off or not. "
"1766120","1768060"," There might be a little bit more grind down here."
"1771790","1772890"," It was really funny."
"1773030","1774670"," I was like so much like videos last night. "
"1774850","1778730"," Man, some of these fucking guys have been making market crash videos for two straight months."
"1779710","1781450"," I can't imagine for two straight."
"1781450","1785250"," I can't imagine for there were actually some of them longer like three months. "
"1785550","1786030"," There were people."
"1786870","1787970"," There were people."
"1789350","1790230"," Hold on here. "
"1791070","1792850"," It's not a fucking farther time."
"1793130","1799530"," So you got to remember like there were there were market crash videos here."
"1799830","1801490"," There were market crash videos here. "
"1802010","1804110"," There were market crash videos here."
"1804390","1805490"," Market crash videos here."
"1805710","1806670"," Market crash videos here. "
"1807130","1808390"," I'm like Jesus."
"1808770","1811990"," There was one guy from stock charts anonymous."
"1812770","1816070"," He was I appreciate Elliott waivers out there. "
"1816270","1819770"," But dude, this guy was calling for a market crash for the last like five."
"1819770","1824370"," This one specific guy was calling for a market crash for his last five videos."
"1824890","1826290"," It was like it was like okay. "
"1826390","1827890"," So this week we're going to lose 800 points."
"1828730","1830030"," Like in the next two days."
"1830710","1832490"," He like just kept doing it and doing it. "
"1832930","1835250"," And so he had he put another one out yesterday."
"1836910","1839610"," And I was like oh here I was like he's finally going to get lucky."
"1840830","1842550"," About the economy and data suggesting. "
"1843110","1843550"," Finally."
"1844850","1846710"," Maybe maybe needed for longer."
"1850970","1853770"," I was like you just keep making them until you're until you're proven right. "
"1853950","1854170"," I guess."
"1854530","1856030"," It's two hundred day moving average."
"1856390","1856830"," Eventually. "
"1857190","1858310"," Eventually you're right."
"1858590","1861030"," I'm going to take having now that one hundred underperformed."
"1862370","1864130"," Some in some four hundred C's. "
"1871740","1876600"," I should put a I should put a I should put a put a poll out real quick."

"2000060","2004240"," This this would still be validated even if you went to four."
"2004780","2007940"," I think Mike Wilson said we could possibly go four one five zero."

"2060820","2062639"," I think I think I answered it yes so."
"2079500","2082980"," It's really where it covers up my chat to the question does. "
"2095850","2097570"," Still just grinding here."
"2099270","2102110"," Lots of rotation large level."
"2110400","2112460"," Would definitely would not surprise me. "
"2112540","2113260"," Let me show you this here."
"2114060","2117220"," Would not surprise an attempt here to reject."
"2117600","2121700"," We're looking for some kind of rejection tag out at S3. "
"2123060","2126820"," This would be a it was a I think that I haven't looked but I think this is two deviations"
"2126820","2127280"," right."
"2127960","2130720"," I think this is two deviate or this is the start of a second deviation."
"2131420","2134320"," I haven't looked to check with the actual deviations at this point. "
"2136420","2137980"," I guess we could look on."
"2140540","2141460"," So 410."
"2142400","2142820"," 396. "
"2145540","2148860"," That the peak was 410 the low at this point is 396."
"2152500","2154380"," I'd like to see what the deviation is."
"2155580","2157100"," It looks like there's one. "
"2157260","2161320"," We went all the way to the top of the key to full deviation right."
"2161320","2163080"," To 410 if you're looking at the trend."
"2163660","2168180"," We just I think this is one deviation away from at least the upper trend. "
"2171500","2179240"," So you could certainly make the case for more more blood today."
"2183700","2185180"," So far only 36 votes."
"2185340","2187800"," Let me also post the live stream to Twitter. "
"2193680","2194880"," Just a second there."
"2203310","2203730"," Share."
"2206430","2206850"," Copy. "
"2241540","2243240"," That's still kind of a weak level down here."
"2243340","2244560"," I'm looking on book map down here."
"2261800","2263920"," The support here is really light. "
"2264300","2265800"," If we start breaking levels here."
"2265880","2266460"," I'm going to show you this."
"2267280","2268560"," Fair and greed index. "
"2269240","2272000"," 25 out of 100 signaling extreme fear."
"2274900","2276240"," Make it a break here."
"2276500","2278120"," I'm going to have to cut this position right now. "
"2279880","2280980"," Fair and greed index."
"2285340","2291700"," I would expect that I would expect the fair index to be maxed out right now or we are because"
"2291700","2293400"," without a doubt."
"2294820","2295620"," Without a doubt. "
"2295780","2298240"," This is a slam on the door for bulls."
"2298460","2299340"," This is telling a bull."
"2300540","2301640"," Look the fuck out below. "
"2302180","2302460"," We're coming."
"2302780","2303140"," Crazy."
"2305020","2305640"," Congratulations. "
"2306420","2307640"," I have to give it to you."
"2307740","2309580"," You're talking two straight months."
"2310460","2311080"," October. "
"2312140","2312840"," Excuse me."
"2312900","2313920"," More than two months."
"2314260","2318060"," So you figure at least October 13th. "
"2318060","2320680"," And we're now in December."
"2321220","2321280"," Right."
"2322060","2323000"," December 6th. "
"2323300","2323860"," So almost."
"2324680","2326960"," Time on almost two full months of."
"2329600","2334680"," Not being able to get any kind of a comfortable first being stopped out. "
"2336900","2338680"," First being stopped out from."
"2340500","2342600"," The bottom of the key, the bottom of the channel."
"2343660","2346160"," And then so many false false signals. "
"2346160","2349540"," You can't say they weren't a ton of false signals."
"2350120","2352220"," We had so many events in that upward rip."
"2352220","2357400"," That said, we should crack or not crash, but you know, like roll out of the channel. "
"2357760","2358840"," Head, head to lows."
"2359160","2362840"," I can't tell you how many times people were like, I'm fucking full."
"2363000","2363840"," It's short right here. "
"2364560","2367760"," Oh, shit."
"2367860","2371200"," We're going to come back up calls or at 21 cents."
"2371360","2372460"," Now at 23 cents. "
"2373080","2379510"," I mean, I want to make back those."
"2379810","2380370"," I want to make back."
"2380370","2384810"," I've got 10 contracts on right now, so maybe I'll make back what I lost back over here. "
"2385490","2385850"," Yesterday."
"2389550","2392830"," We'll put a little small demand box down here."
"2396020","2396880"," Keep note of it. "
"2397020","2398820"," Or remember this kind of an area down here."
"2398860","2400020"," There's some buyers down here."
"2415270","2416870"," Let's see, we got 63 votes. "
"2417090","2418270"," See if you can vote for this poll."
"2418950","2420270"," I'm going to end it here in just a minute."
"2420270","2421290"," I want to see what you guys think. "
"2422610","2424770"," You know, it's not really the bearish is for today."
"2424830","2431410"," It's more did they open the door to some significant lows to a meaty trade down below."
"2433670","2436310"," And the only commentary I would make on that would be. "
"2437450","2440770"," We had last, I think it was last week or two weeks ago."
"2441230","2443970"," Mike Wilson said we're not actively selling the market."
"2444670","2447270"," And there was implications of 420. "
"2447270","2449410"," I think he said 430 440."
"2450270","2451830"," And the first gap was 420."
"2452330","2456230"," So you know, these guys are always going to give you a higher or lower number than their actual"
"2456230","2456630"," targets. "
"2458070","2460550"," And then, but then he reversed course."
"2460930","2469170"," And I was actually, I think I spoke to, um, uh, to, uh, Baba Yaga last night."
"2469310","2470170"," I had made an off comment. "
"2470370","2470730"," I had said."
"2472050","2474270"," I wondered if they were swinging dicks."
"2474270","2478850"," If he was swinging dicks with Mike Barry, Mike Barry came out and said he was short. "
"2479730","2484210"," You know, there was like, it was almost like two swinging dicks trying to almost like Mike."
"2484210","2486590"," So Mike Wilson's always wanting to be the contrarian."
"2487450","2492610"," And you've got, you know, Barry trying to be a market mover. "
"2493070","2499150"," And then, you know, of course, uh, fucking Mike or the other Mike is like, nope, I'm not selling"
"2499150","2499690"," this market."
"2501530","2507070"," And then as soon as Barry says, uh, not short any longer, you see fucking, uh, Wilson come out and"
"2507070","2509390"," be like, oh, yeah, we're selling everything."
"2509650","2509970"," Fuck you. "
"2510170","2511590"," Like Monday morning Bloomberg."
"2512210","2512590"," Boom."
"2513010","2513770"," Change their viewpoint. "
"2515430","2520890"," Just that, just that alone would, would at least, uh, facilitate some of the selling here."
"2521030","2523670"," Just Mike saying that was enough for people to be like, nope."
"2523850","2524450"," Fuck you were selling. "
"2527630","2529050"," Now we got 86 votes in there."
"2529110","2529910"," I'm going to end this poll."
"2530570","2532730"," I don't know how me a second here. "
"2542420","2544240"," Let's have a look at the results of this poll."
"2554850","2561050"," Dude, what the fuck is going on with this fucking YouTube?"
"2562370","2563250"," Sometimes YouTube."
"2572580","2577840"," I'm getting this really, uh, I have to like close YouTube, reopen YouTube. "
"2598210","2600350"," So it doesn't think that I'm in stream right now."
"2605920","2608960"," Yeah, so you've got, have the bears open the door to much lower lows?"
"2608960","2612720"," Uh, yes, 60% no 39% I'm quite impressed."
"2613640","2620320"," Uh, with that, uh, with that, those poll numbers, I'm interested in two parts to this question. "
"2620600","2621500"," Hang time for a second here."
"2624200","2624720"," Okay."
"2624900","2626720"," So I'm interested in this question that was asked. "
"2627540","2628160"," Hold on."
"2628240","2629180"," I want to look at my calls here."
"2630720","2632420"," Still not gaining much traction, man. "
"2632560","2634460"," This is all just short covering right here."
"2634860","2636980"," My calls are up 24 cents."
"2637780","2638320"," Yes. "
"2638500","2640320"," They should be blasting up right now."
"2640560","2642960"," And they're, they're not, uh, just a few pennies."

"2658160","2661880"," If you are long calls here, you want to be careful of this VWAP. "
"2662020","2666230"," You're going to surely we're going to hit this VWAP."
"2667210","2671390"," Consolidate or roll or consolidate and then want to make another trip higher here."
"2672510","2676510"," Remember, we've got more resistance here now at three 98 16. "
"2677030","2679810"," And then the big bore resistance up here, right?"
"2680890","2681950"," The SMA 200."
"2682110","2683190"," I don't, this has changed."
"2683590","2683870"," I know. "
"2684170","2688890"," So I'll look at the SMA where the 200 is today and we'll put it in here, but this, but"
"2688890","2692410"," this is vicinity right here is going to be high volatility here."
"2693230","2699330"," So you've got three, uh, so you've got three places to be looking for, four places look for some"
"2699330","2699590"," resistance."
"2699630","2703130"," If you're, uh, trying to trade this up, you're going to be looking for S one. "
"2703390","2704930"," That's three 96 89."
"2705570","2710410"," You're going to be looking for VWAP coming down and you're going to see that confluence of VWAP in"
"2710410","2711890"," this, this area right here."
"2712210","2716430"," The second one's going to be, of course, three 96 16, the previous low from yesterday. "
"2716690","2717650"," We'll type that in."
"2725510","2727550"," I don't think we're done going down today, personally."
"2728510","2731550"," Uh, not seeing, not seeing my calls cranked. "
"2731710","2732790"," They should be cranking in value."
"2733290","2735650"," What it's telling me is that we're not done going down today."
"2740670","2744050"," Should be, should be a nice, they should be getting some premium kick and they're not getting"
"2744050","2745030"," premium kick right now. "
"2745150","2746250"," So be real careful of your bull."
"2746610","2750650"," Put some, um, uh, uh, stop on your, on your calls."
"2750650","2755130"," If you're in with this trade right here, if we reverse quickly, you'll see like, you know, if you"
"2755130","2757790"," got like 20 cent calls, we start blasting down. "
"2757870","2759450"," They'll go to like 10 cents in two seconds."
"2759870","2764890"," So, uh, and as we, as we trade up here, uh, you want to put like, you know, 18 cents,"
"2765070","2767470"," 20 cents, 22 cents, 24 cents."
"2768190","2770390"," You know, that kind of stuff as a, as you make a way higher. "
"2771890","2773310"," If we, if we make our way higher."
"2774170","2780850"," Uh, this question that I asked was, have the bears opened the door to much lower lows?"
"2781910","2784390"," So 60% of you are saying yes."
"2784830","2787030"," Uh, I don't need to get into why. "
"2787290","2790090"," We already talked about why 60% should be thinking."
"2790270","2794290"," I think this is, I think they've, I think I answered that for you this morning, but I'm fascinated"
"2794290","2799610"," by the, uh, 39% that say, no, this is not a door opening."
"2800130","2801590"," Uh, for bears. "
"2801590","2803570"," They were concerned by that."
"2804350","2807330"," Uh, well, I guess one more where my concern is."
"2808630","2811630"," Uh, by the third, by the 39% that answered, no. "
"2812850","2816470"," Would be how as a, as a bull, if you're a bull or a bear."
"2817010","2821890"," Uh, in the chat, let me know what you look for for signals for."
"2822790","2827490"," Uh, confirmation for a bearish, larger trend move down. "
"2829930","2832310"," Um, because I'm fascinated by the answer."
"2832470","2837710"," No, because I have my own standard or not my own standards, but I have."
"2838710","2842130"," I want to see certain things happen and they overall checked off this morning. "
"2842130","2843270"," That doesn't mean we don't trade higher."
"2844250","2847410"," Uh, it means, it means more of, did they open the door?"
"2847590","2849490"," Did they open the fucking door to get to lower lows?"
"2849690","2852890"," I don't know what else you would need to have answered."
"2853750","2857830"," As a bull, uh, for a large trend reversal. "
"2858810","2862230"," Even on a smaller timeframe, uh, it seems like these."
"2863090","2865770"," Even on a smaller timeframe, like an intraday or a weekly."
"2866490","2870690"," You're kind of looking for these kind of moves, uh, now for lower lows. "
"2881930","2882370"," Okay."
"2882370","2883710"," Are you guys not thinking this is live?"
"2885330","2886090"," This is live."
"2886470","2889610"," If you feel like it's not live enough for you, you can go down to the. "
"2889610","2892010"," Uh, YouTube cog settings."
"2893190","2896330"," And click on them and it'll ask you for a playback."
"2897190","2897530"," Speed. "
"2897950","2901950"," Click times two and you should be like three seconds off from live."
"2907050","2908210"," So what do we have?"
"2908450","2914010"," So Fabio is saying that the rising channel is not broken until 3950."
"2917140","2922000"," Yeah, I've got a, I've got two channels as well, Fabio, I've got like these symmetrical channel. "
"2922820","2928300"," And then I've got this like a rising wedge, which is the ones the bears want to break."
"2928440","2929060"," They want to break the wedge."
"2929120","2930640"," They want to bring that break that wedge. "
"2931040","2932560"," So yeah, Fabio, I couldn't understand that."
"2933120","2934720"," It's a fair, it's a fair point, brother."
"2935700","2936100"," 100%. "
"2936100","2938440"," And I appreciate you answering why you answered no to."
"2944050","2945030"," What else are you asking?"
"2945290","2946330"," Where's Tesla floor now?"
"2947210","2953660"," Uh, we've had targets on Tesla for, let's bring up Tesla real quick."
"2958790","2962290"," Uh, so Tesla, we've got a, we've got two targets on Tesla. "
"2962290","2972120"," I think, uh, is this not the chart that we're using for the Tesla"
"2972120","2972480"," floor?"
"2973160","2974560"," Uh, let me see."
"2976120","2978600"," Yeah, this is the chart we're using for day trade and Tesla, right?"
"2980360","2983600"," Uh, anyways, targets on Tesla, I've got, I think it's 135."
"2984560","2985480"," I'll bring it up on a different chart. "
"2986060","2993500"," So we've got like research charts and then, uh, we've got research charts and then we've got, uh,"
"2993580","2997520"," trading, like day trading charts for Tesla off the top of my head."
"2998100","3005240"," Uh, on the, on the Tesla charts, the price target is, I think 135 to 150."
"3005840","3008880"," And then $94 or $97. "
"3011480","3016900"," You'd be expecting, you would be expecting, uh, hold on here."
"3019040","3024860"," You'd be expecting Tesla to, uh, find aggressive, aggressive buyers."
"3024980","3031000"," So three billion at the starting of 1%, 20, 32 guilds by auction on December the 13th. "
"3034640","3042240"," You'd be expecting aggressive buyer, aggressive buyers to step in at, uh, it's roughly 135 to 150."
"3042240","3052390"," And then the, you'd also expect some sort of, you would also expect some sort of, um, capitulation"
"3052390","3057430"," move down, selling into, selling into those buyers and bring it down to a brief."
"3057690","3063850"," You probably, if you're a Tesla bull, you probably want to set some kind of an alarm. "
"3066630","3068890"," That rings your phone at like 134."
"3068890","3077390"," Uh, and you'd want to ring your phone because you want, it might have, it would probably, the"
"3077390","3081090"," likelihood of it happening at like four o'clock in the morning, four or 15 in the morning."
"3081690","3083830"," Uh, you would, you might miss that turn. "
"3084110","3087270"," You probably, you probably want to set the same alarm at like 150 to 135."
"3088670","3097190"," And you'll likely see a, um, early morning, uh, it likely wouldn't be in the cash market or it"
"3097190","3098110"," would be in pre market."
"3099150","3101690"," Uh, it doesn't always happen like that, but oftentimes it does. "
"3102470","3104230"," That's the price target on Tesla."
"3114750","3116230"," Uh, we're seeing here."
"3117230","3119710"," Uh, the rising channel is not broken until three and Xmas rally. "
"3119970","3121590"," Uh, Christmas rally?"
"3122330","3122570"," I don't know."
"3122870","3125150"," The biggest bear right now is Mike Wilson."
"3125430","3129170"," He's saying you've got Christmas rally to four, one, five, zero. "
"3129410","3131630"," I would still, I still give him credence on that trade."
"3132270","3133790"," And you've had a Christmas rally now."
"3135550","3138290"," Since October, I would say you've had a Chris. "
"3138470","3141110"," I would say bulls have had a Christmas rally for two and a half months."
"3143070","3143990"," That's what I would say."
"3145170","3150270"," Uh, you can, you can give a congratulations to bears for rolling the market over here, but you then"
"3150270","3153730"," congratulate, uh, bears right once they get down to 3500 to 3200. "
"3154710","3156970"," No, so yeah, I think the bulls did a good job."
"3157230","3157310"," Absolutely."
"3160230","3163770"," Uh, half the people have no clue what they're talking about. "
"3163770","3165690"," Uh, I'm looking for a reaction of 395."
"3166030","3170730"," So Matthew Phillips is saying he's still looking for that reaction off 395 down here."
"3171590","3173190"," He wants to see if there's a reaction. "
"3173270","3174790"," If this is kind of a localized bottom."
"3175450","3178270"," If we break 395, could see a more significant reversal."
"3179050","3182530"," Increase probability of a, of at least the large reversal versus a new low. "
"3183090","3185650"," Uh, yeah, that, you know, Matthew, that makes sense to it."
"3186010","3190630"," I respect that opinion too, because, uh, you're saying just like the entire run up."
"3191170","3193710"," We've had, so I think the point behind this would be. "
"3196010","3198950"," I think that this, the point behind this contention is."
"3203670","3207610"," I think the point behind this contention is that there, there have been these moments where we've"
"3207610","3209230"," had giant sell-offs."
"3209910","3211310"," He followed my cursor there. "
"3211550","3213090"," Some huge ones down here."
"3214430","3215810"," This one took what two days."
"3216950","3218710"," And then of course this big one right here. "
"3219990","3221870"," And again, this one, uh, right over here."
"3223230","3227990"," And so I think the point is, you know, we've, we've demonstrated that we can, we can."
"3229550","3232250"," Reach really deeper liquidity and take a giant move higher. "
"3233010","3236430"," Uh, same, same kind of move here, but even more so."
"3237770","3240430"," Uh, the power of these moves higher, you know, there is."
"3241030","3243130"," For you bulls out there that are still bullish. "
"3243390","3246790"," So if we get, if you, if you want to entertain what bulls are saying here."
"3247970","3249970"," Uh, which we can."
"3251790","3254950"," There are some charts that agree with that statement. "
"3255830","3257790"," Like if you want to bring them up for you, I will."
"3258030","3258950"," I'll bring them up right now."
"3259110","3259230"," Hold on. "
"3263030","3264230"," Give me two seconds."
"3267830","3270610"," So there are some charts out there that."
"3272310","3274090"," To an extent, give. "
"3275110","3275550"," Hold on here."
"3279100","3281020"," Some credence to what the bulls are saying."
"3281020","3285740"," And I disagree with this statement, but, uh, let me just a second. "
"3285940","3286960"," What we'll do is, um."
"3292430","3294850"," US stocks extended for S&P 500."
"3294850","3296130"," Just a minute here. "
"3296230","3296690"," One percent."
"3300410","3304730"," And we'll talk about what the, what the, what the, uh, bears are saying here."
"3305650","3310930"," Bank of England says they sold zero spot nine, eight, three, six billion standing of guilt at the"
"3310930","3313470"," sales window for long dated and index linked guilt. "
"3326070","3331130"," Let me just say, I'm going to bring up some, some chart stuff."
"3334590","3335710"," We're looking for here."
"3341310","3342390"," Should make this simple. "
"3342610","3343850"," We can make this simple, I guess."

"3361390","3364570"," Put this back for the, uh, for the guys out there. "
"3367910","3368910"," Okay, so."
"3369950","3372350"," There's some bulls here that are saying, uh."
"3373730","3376870"," So that a convincing break of three nine five zero. "
"3378790","3380030"," Which there hasn't been."
"3382670","3388290"," That, uh, this is just another liquidity grab down below for a much larger move higher to."
"3388890","3390970"," Let's say, uh, let's call four forty. "
"3391130","3392410"," Let's say four twenty to four forty."
"3396540","3400600"," Let's look at the, let's look at the, but we spent the, the first hour on what time was right"
"3400600","3400820"," now."
"3401560","3403060"," Yeah, we spent the first hour on the bear case. "
"3403700","3405320"," So we'll spend the next hour on the bull case."
"3405880","3406640"," Uh, so you know what?"
"3406720","3407800"," I don't want to leave either side out here."
"3411860","3413820"," I think, I think at this point, I'm on camp. "
"3414820","3414860"," Bear."
"3415500","3418480"," Uh, that doesn't mean we don't blast off here, but."
"3420180","3424640"," It doesn't mean we don't trade up to forty one five five zero, but I'm, I'm certainly for my, for"
"3424640","3425320"," what I want to see. "
"3426100","3428320"," Uh, this is probably the most."
"3430340","3434360"," Constructive, uh, move for the bears at this point for making their case."
"3434800","3437000"," So they've been making their case to me since. "
"3437840","3440940"," I think it came out and said, uh, by the dip on the thirteenth of October."
"3442560","3445940"," And I stayed with that opinion all the way through and all the way up to the top here."
"3446700","3448920"," And gave the bulls the chance to break out. "
"3449200","3452120"," I figured they would have to do some kind of consolidation move."
"3452560","3455780"," This week, but the way the bears are throwing it down the today."
"3456340","3457780"," They're making me believe their case. "
"3458020","3462140"," So I have to give that to the bears without a doubt and I have to give them the benefit"
"3462140","3463200"," of doubt at this point, but."
"3463820","3465020"," I understand what you're saying."
"3465680","3466840"," And there is a way. "
"3468640","3471320"," And that the, if you're a bear, you should be watching this."
"3471680","3473140"," It's important for you to watch."
"3473260","3475840"," If you want like an inflection point for bears, this is going. "
"3476020","3477760"," I'm going to show you where the inflection point is."
"3477760","3481660"," If you're, if you're a bear and you're like, hey, uh, fuck you, cap."
"3482480","3483140"," Doors open. "
"3483360","3483880"," We're going down."
"3484400","3487640"," I would the only thing that I would say to you would be as we head down."
"3488120","3490380"," I'm going to show you where the inflection point is for bears. "
"3490760","3492040"," The first inflection point, I think."
"3494480","3496140"," It's going to be very simple and easy."
"3498280","3499140"," Not too hard. "
"3500320","3501780"," We'll make this really simple."
"3503900","3504900"," I don't know if I can show."
"3505020","3506560"," I'm going to try to show this on a."
"3511560","3513020"," Yeah, I'm going to show this on a large timeframe. "
"3514340","3518180"," I'm sitting and bring this up right now."
"3519060","3519860"," Okay, you guys, right?"
"3519980","3521240"," We're making lower lows right now."
"3521460","3521560"," So. "
"3530470","3530830"," Okay."
"3532390","3536270"," So there are some, uh, this is a price percent oscillator."
"3536270","3540370"," This is, uh, a, um, market breadth indicator. "
"3540870","3542850"," There are some arguments for the bulls."
"3543110","3548490"," They're very small, uh, but I'm going to give it to him for a reason."
"3548650","3550210"," I want to show you what this reason is right here. "
"3551030","3551990"," Uh, just right here."
"3552170","3555910"," I want you to see, I want you to see back here."
"3556130","3559010"," There was, there was some, some large accumulation back here. "
"3559010","3559210"," Okay."
"3560550","3563310"," Unusually large accumulation on a low."
"3564290","3569110"," You saw something similar, uh, in, in this, in this area here. "
"3569210","3569370"," Okay."
"3570970","3574270"," You can also see, you know, this is going back only to 2019."
"3574270","3575770"," We can show examples of this. "
"3576450","3579590"," Uh, going, I can show you examples of this going back to the 1970s."
"3580230","3581810"," Uh, not, not today."
"3581970","3582670"," We're not doing that today. "
"3583110","3585230"," Uh, something similar down here as well, right?"
"3585610","3588270"," And you kind of see in that kind of, kind of moves here."
"3589710","3592850"," There is a case from the bears that."
"3593170","3599410"," Yeah, but, you know, it's 0, 7, 0, 0, that, you know, we have that one last 45 VIX style,"
"3599410","3601270"," the kind of nonsense you guys already know about that stuff. "
"3601870","3603970"," Uh, and we have that kind of a thing happening."
"3604230","3605330"," We had a little bit of this here."
"3606330","3608290"," Which, uh, corn coincides with this bottom. "
"3609170","3610250"," We had more of it."
"3611190","3614910"," Some real accumulation here, uh, in this, in this area here."
"3615910","3617790"," Uh, now, what does that mean?"
"3617790","3622070"," It doesn't mean much right now for the bulls, but it does mean one thing that's important. "
"3624910","3628610"," And that would be, uh, this here's where the inflection point would be for bears."
"3628990","3633110"," If you see, uh, the breath come down here."
"3635170","3636710"," And the breath starts heading down. "
"3638050","3641350"," And, uh, you see the PPOs come down, but do not cross."
"3645550","3649450"," Uh, and if there was a trade higher here and this trade higher here."
"3650210","3654930"," Uh, now I'll show you an example of the breaking because it did break. "
"3655290","3657730"," Uh, it did break, I think, yeah, right here."
"3658930","3662510"," So you would see like, let's say, let's pretend we're right here right now, right?"
"3663230","3664610"," You can see the style down."
"3665890","3667710"," And this is where the break point would come. "
"3667870","3668770"," And that's where you get the bloodbath."
"3669590","3670590"," And that's right here."
"3671630","3673570"," So you'd actually see us go down. "
"3674350","3677690"," Uh, so you'd be looking for the first part of this trade."
"3678890","3681510"," You'd be looking for something like this right here, right?"
"3681730","3685050"," This would be the first move down for the bull for the bears."
"3685630","3687150"," Bears like, you know, we're going down. "
"3687290","3687710"," We're going down."
"3687730","3688310"," We're going down."
"3688830","3690870"," We'll be looking for an inflection point right here. "
"3691550","3696130"," And if you see that, if you see that the breath has gone down enough, this would be a moment"
"3696130","3700010"," for you as a bear to say, okay, I'm going to take my profit and just wait and see and"
"3700010","3701910"," make sure we don't make our way higher here."
"3702110","3702630"," Does that make sense?"
"3703110","3706210"," You'd really want to start to see the PPOs break down."
"3706210","3707290"," There's some other charts. "
"3707310","3714470"," There's some other PPMs, PPOs, and some other things that can show you that would disagree with"
"3714470","3714630"," this."
"3714910","3719050"," There's another thing, too, to be concerned about."
"3719330","3720630"," And that's on larger timeframes. "
"3721690","3725870"," If you look on a monthly range, what are we on?"
"3726090","3727050"," Let's do a monthly range."
"3730630","3734750"," And, you know, for, well, I guess we shouldn't be doing, um, let's do SPX."
"3735930","3744450"," Probably should have been doing this all along in SPX, but, you know, other than some, I don't know"
"3744450","3745370"," why this isn't coming up here. "
"3745530","3748990"," Oh, that's because I need to be doing momentum and some kind of a momentum indicator."
"3749690","3751130"," Maybe I'll bring this up another time."
"3751290","3758650"," There's a momentum indicator that shows very well that we're at the end of a, um, a cycle. "
"3759250","3761050"," These are the wrong indicators for a monthly chart."
"3761950","3766090"," But I'll look for the momentum indicator that I posted on Twitter."
"3766090","3771430"," There's a momentum indicator that's showing that we're kind of at the bottom, uh, of a localized,"
"3772190","3775290"," or there's a localized bottom here. "
"3776790","3782030"," That's not to be trifled with either because even the selling off today, the selling off this past"
"3782030","3790250"," three days over the scale of a year, uh, it's, it's, this is a tick in the course of a"
"3790250","3790430"," year."
"3791030","3792530"," Uh, so that would be the bull."
"3792530","3793750"," Uh, there'd be two, like that bull. "
"3793870","3798290"," I'm going to be looking forward inflection points as we get a roll over in market breath."
"3798610","3804790"," Look for an inflection point, uh, as the, as the price for any kind of price percent oscillators"
"3804790","3806590"," are used on different timeframes."
"3806890","3812810"," If those come down and they haven't breached, uh, bear bull, right?"
"3812970","3815970"," The bear bull line on whatever one you're looking at, whatever timeframe you're looking at. "
"3816630","3819730"," Uh, that, that would be the bull case."
"3821530","3824590"," Let me see if I can, you know what I'll do is I'll look for the momentum indicator."
"3826750","3827790"," Just sitting here. "
"3836830","3838390"," Uh, I'm not seeing it here."
"3841590","3842110"," Why not?"
"3844130","3846330"," It's a, it's like a cycle indicator of some kind."
"3846810","3847110"," Hold on. "
"3847210","3847710"," Look for a cycle."
"3848730","3849730"," Cycle swing momentum."
"3850230","3851070"," I don't know if that's it. "
"3851070","3853010"," It might be this one right here."
"3859880","3861320"," Let me get rid of some of this stuff here."
"3876160","3877600"," I think it's from Levinson. "
"3879820","3880780"," Is it Larriman?"
"3881800","3882620"," Yeah, right here."
"3884840","3888020"," Uh, this would be the other case for the, uh, for the bulls."
"3894110","3898650"," So if you're looking for this one right here kind of sucks, this cycle swing doesn't really work on"
"3898650","3899090"," that timeframe. "
"3899930","3905870"," If you're looking at a much, much larger timeframe for the, for the bulls, how far back do you guys"
"3905870","3907310"," want to go 70s, 73?"
"3908130","3909010"," You know, 73."
"3911370","3916010"," Uh, so if you, if you get rid of the noise, right?"
"3916170","3916570"," And you're a bull."
"3918950","3923790"," Uh, you only see very, very few times when you break below here, right?"
"3924070","3925630"," This is really what the bears are betting on. "
"3926550","3928090"," So this is the, we'll talk about this."
"3928170","3929450"," I was an important argument to talk about."
"3929570","3930930"," I think I talked about it on Twitter briefly. "
"3932630","3935390"," Uh, when you start getting down here, these are extremes to the market."
"3935570","3938750"," Now, it's not showing on this chart here, but this is."
"3939750","3942330"," I made some pretty significant selloffs in the, in these moments. "
"3942550","3943330"," You can actually see it."
"3945050","3950350"," Here for two thousand eight, you can see it for the two thousand, two thousand two, uh, swing lows."
"3950750","3954570"," And the important thing that you need to know is you've seen it once again here. "
"3955230","3960630"," Uh, that we've made this cycle that we've made this actual cycle low."
"3961110","3961990"," In 2022."
"3963030","3965330"," Uh, you got, you guys seeing this on the chart here?"
"3965410","3968690"," It's very, this is a very simple, just a cyclical nature of the market. "
"3969210","3972630"," Uh, and this is the argument that you see made."
"3972910","3976410"," I don't know if everyone knows, but the argument that's being made on Twitter is that."
"3976910","3980030"," The bullish argument is, uh, TLT will go up. "
"3980030","3983250"," HYG and Jan Kale, the dog shit bonds will go down."
"3983910","3988170"," Spy should trade sideways and, uh, spy should trade sideways."
"3989170","3993030"," And attempt to make, uh, hit 3200 to 3100. "
"3994670","3994970"," This year."
"3997210","3998850"," Uh, but will fail."
"3999830","4003830"," You get a sideways market in the NSPX in tech. "
"4004810","4008750"," Uh, and what it would do, the market would basically just be in a holding pattern until they get"
"4008750","4009190"," their crash."
"4010110","4012230"," Uh, so you'd have viable bottoms."
"4012510","4020010"," Let's call it from 2023, 2024, uh, until there's like a timing is right, right?"
"4020210","4022570"," You get just enough, uh, layoffs. "
"4023550","4027030"," You get, uh, a ceasing of QT."
"4027350","4029090"," So they've broken something, right?"
"4030110","4034790"," Uh, you get, I don't know, inflation hasn't come down like you thought it would."
"4035390","4037910"," There's all kinds of, you know, unemployment is high, right?"
"4037910","4043590"," Uh, re-stagflation infl- so you get the first to get the stagflation and the recession, and then"
"4043590","4049290"," you'd have this like bloodbath moment to reset the market, re-pricing of the market, uh, as well. "
"4050030","4054030"," So this is saying on a larger timeframe, not this, we're at a bottom."
"4054870","4058530"," Uh, and then I'll show you something else that's really neat on this, on this, on this concept."
"4059870","4060790"," Give me a second here. "
"4061750","4063470"," So this, this is this bull concept, right?"
"4064770","4067190"," Uh, let me just a second here."
"4067190","4075960"," Uh, 200 day."
"4080180","4081640"," This is the scary part. "
"4090530","4091850"," Just a second here."
"4100090","4101630"," It's calculating right now."
"4101729","4102229"," Just me a second. "
"4112670","4114550"," Uh, hold on."
"4130410","4131590"," This would be brutal."
"4132290","4134069"," This is like one of the most brutal things. "
"4138689","4139090"," Okay."
"4142830","4151470"," Uh, so just, just cyclically, this would be an, this would be the implied move."
"4155130","4158350"," This is where it gets scary for, this is where it gets scary for a bear. "
"4160750","4164490"," So this is a January, March of 2024."
"4165750","4169569"," You would rob, uh, you would, this, this is the sideways market."
"4169910","4171609"," We'll, we'll show this on TLT too. "
"4171710","4176170"," Cause this on TLT, TLT just TLT literally just rocket ships up."
"4176970","4179630"," Uh, this is that stag-flated market."
"4179970","4184229"," And if you have that stag-flated market, what you would see is, uh, the attempt move down. "
"4184689","4192750"," The attempted move down, uh, into, uh, you know, attempt to break below this 3500, right?"
"4192910","4193450"," It would be rejected."
"4193950","4194870"," You get another shot."
"4195010","4195830"," I think this is April. "
"4196390","4198010"," And this is, you know, this is April."
"4198190","4198730"," This is the end of March."
"4199310","4200290"," This is the end of January. "
"4201130","4202270"," Yeah, this is the end of January."
"4202450","4203790"," And this is the end of March right here."
"4204450","4206890"," Uh, you'd have the sideways market for the rest of the summer. "
"4207290","4209990"," So there's your, there's your, uh, March low, right?"
"4210210","4210650"," April low."
"4211230","4214330"," You have the shocker surprise summer rally."
"4215270","4217050"," Uh, you break through down here. "
"4217770","4220670"," Uh, this is where you get close, but no cigar on your 3200."
"4220670","4222530"," But it's an attempt, right?"
"4222730","4225370"," And you get another attempt and another attempt into the end of 2024."
"4225490","4227730"," E sanctioned measures against Russia. "
"4229910","4232310"," So I get this would be the neutral bull argument."
"4232410","4236670"," This would be where, uh, this would be where you- The stream is sponsored by to the tick."
"4237030","4243530"," If you're a bear and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"4243830","4247270"," If you're a bear in this scenario, there's, there's a problem with this, right?"
"4247990","4250430"," You'd be robbed of getting the new lows that you wanted. "
"4251010","4257330"," And it also gives the fed the time, uh, or the market, or the market, the, the time to, whenever"
"4257330","4259930"," it's ready to pull the plug on the market."
"4260410","4262410"," Let's say they're like, oh, yeah, congratulations over."
"4262550","4263170"," Recessions is over. "
"4263550","4264890"," You know, we're going to reset the market."
"4265570","4269170"," Uh, unemployment everybody's out in the streets losing their houses in the cars."
"4269170","4269950"," All kinds of craziness. "
"4270070","4271970"," And they can then decide slam."
"4272410","4274390"," We're going to do that one last, uh, down move."
"4274550","4275510"," And then we start the new market. "
"4276010","4276450"," Slam."
"4276850","4277770"," We do it in January."
"4278050","4278770"," We can do it in what?"
"4279410","4279970"," We can do it in January. "
"4281010","4282950"," We can do it in the middle of, uh, of April."
"4283210","4284230"," We have now we have all these choices."
"4285010","4289850"," This is the, this is the manipulation of the market where you can say, yeah, we manipulate the"
"4289850","4290330"," market down. "
"4290550","4297290"," It gives us the opportunity to, um, uh, lower prices on stocks like Tesla."
"4297910","4302070"," And then whenever we're ready to, to drain the last bit of the market out."
"4302070","4305010"," Like, they have the choice of when to do it. "
"4305510","4309810"," For the rest of 2024, 2023 into 2024 is really scary, right?"
"4310590","4314590"," I should do an overlay at some point of what TLT, TLT just like rockets."
"4315670","4316910"," Straight up during this time period."
"4316950","4318230"," Like it just lasts. "
"4320910","4325020"," Um, that's kind of like the neutral bull case."
"4327040","4329060"," Uh, it's very tradable."
"4329280","4329820"," Hold on a second here. "
"4329820","4330740"," Bank of America."
"4330740","4334900"," See more in the hands as the US economy is being slowed by higher interest rates."
"4335560","4343480"," It's, it's very tradable, but it's very, um, that's what the AI is saying, by the way. "
"4344080","4349020"," That's the, uh, not AI, but the algorithm is saying, here's your option where the market goes"
"4349020","4352080"," sideways, uh, in 2023."
"4355000","4356660"," And what it does, it just trades sideways."
"4356660","4361880"," It's just looking, just looking at grind prices on individual tickers, like Apple and Tesla and,"
"4362060","4365100"," uh, you're, you're whatever favorite one you have that you want to buy cheap. "
"4366180","4368780"," And then just, it just opened, it has a hatch right there."
"4368900","4370900"," Just ready to just dump the market one last time."
"4372700","4375700"," It would, it would, it would, it would think bears would be pissed. "
"4376680","4383340"," Hands down, it would be, uh, it would be a stinker for bears and, um, It would be that sideways"
"4383340","4384340"," market for a year."
"4384540","4391240"," It, it hits all the, it hits all the, um, it gives the fed, it gives the banks the chance"
"4391240","4396200"," to, um, have that one quick glass plunge whenever at their time of choosing."
"4397880","4399960"," There's some of you out there saying that this is it, right?"
"4400640","4402660"," You're going to get the crash right now. "
"4403900","4405260"," I think she's down in January."
"4406500","4407520"," We're going to reset the markets."
"4409140","4412660"," Cause whenever I ask that question, I get told, no, we're going to go down to the depths of hell"
"4412660","4414340"," and then we're going to stay there for five more years. "
"4429080","4431420"," So let's see what you guys are talking about stream here."
"4435610","4439970"," So yeah, I guess I can kind of, I guess I can kind of see the bulls saying."
"4445330","4447010"," We don't break 3950. "
"4447830","4449310"," We'll make it out of stab higher."
"4450630","4453130"," I don't know if I see the markets going up completely."
"4454250","4456270"," I think, I think I would agree with that bull case. "
"4456810","4462930"," I'd give it a little bit of credence for, I don't know, maybe a trip to up to 4150 and"
"4462930","4463110"," then."
"4464950","4469950"," Sideways this year, but I, I still am looking for, I think all bulls are looking for."
"4472970","4476070"," One nice, one nice fast move down. "
"4476070","4481610"," We have posted out the article by Sky News on UK's Chancellor Hunt who back review of the city for"
"4481610","4482250"," unbundling."
"4482550","4483670"," Any big bang two point."
"4483790","4487190"," I reform just know this article did come out out around 15 minutes ago. "
"4488190","4490710"," I think the last question though is just only timing."
"4490970","4491550"," When do they do it?"
"4491690","4492210"," When does it happen?"
"4494730","4499930"," I would fully disagree with the bear that's like we should trade down to 1600 and then hold it"
"4499930","4500130"," there."
"4500290","4503130"," Pin it for like, for like five years or ten years. "
"4503270","4505550"," I wouldn't want to, I wouldn't, I wouldn't even want to be in that market."
"4506230","4509870"," I don't think, I don't think a bear would want to be in that market."
"4509870","4510230"," I don't know. "
"4510370","4514150"," Maybe you do, but I don't think a bank would make money in that market."
"4516510","4516870"," Maybe."
"4521330","4523330"," I guess it's always possible. "
"4527510","4528870"," So Amazon fell over."
"4529010","4529950"," I haven't looked at Amazon yet."
"4532300","4534420"," I haven't taken a trip around the market yet. "
"4534580","4534960"," Let me see here."
"4535640","4537060"," That WMs down one percent."
"4538340","4539380"," Tesla's down to 176. "
"4540580","4541320"," It's getting closer."
"4543100","4545480"," I like to see it at 150 to 134 and then 90."
"4546400","4548260"," That pisses people off when I say that. "
"4550520","4552220"," I haven't looked at NDX yet."
"4553320","4554960"," Let's look at NDX real quick."
"4557480","4558960"," You guys want to take a trip around the market?"
"4564010","4569170"," A still bullish context, right?"
"4569330","4572730"," Well, I guess in the long term, or I guess this is a big giant bear flag. "
"4576010","4578330"," Bull's going to try to make an attempt to buy this down here."
"4581240","4582340"," You're going to try, man."
"4583340","4584920"," I guarantee bulls want to buy this. "
"4585400","4587220"," Even if it gets rejected, they want to buy this."
"4588380","4589940"," Without a doubt, bulls want to be buying this."
"4590760","4592220"," It's going to be an interesting trade right here. "
"4592920","4598100"," This is a shit ton of fucking NDX traders that are long and strong down here."
"4599880","4601940"," They're going to get their asses caught one of these days."
"4603540","4608540"," I'll assure you that I assure you that someone..."
"4608540","4609660"," Oh wait, I just take that out of there. "
"4611120","4614120"," I assure you that one of these trading days, I don't know when."
"4622130","4626290"," I don't think it's now, but I think one of these trading days..."
"4628070","4631890"," I think one of these trading days of bull's going to be like trading the levels, trading the"
"4631890","4632210"," levels."
"4634650","4636170"," I don't think it's happening. "
"4636370","4639790"," I don't think it's happening until next year, but there's just going to be..."
"4639790","4641010"," Bye-bye."
"4645370","4646530"," Red bars to hell."
"4648330","4650110"," This looks viable in here though. "
"4652650","4653930"," See what else we can look at."
"4655150","4656470"," Yeah, TLT is up."
"4657070","4657850"," I mean, look at this. "
"4658170","4660030"," TLT is showing..."
"4660030","4662650"," So this is another blogging right here, man."
"4663130","4665890"," When you're seeing TLT move up like this, right?"
"4665890","4670270"," So this is kind of a divergence, right?"
"4671070","4671950"," This is showing..."
"4671950","4674990"," So the bond market's telling you, we're not getting a crash."
"4676690","4677510"," We're just taking profit. "
"4677910","4678890"," We're still moving up."
"4681070","4685110"," It was weak yesterday, but this is showing you that the bond market is telling you."
"4686170","4687150"," This is an interesting thing. "
"4687210","4689430"," When you do like a bond market, I'll show you this."
"4691570","4693350"," How do I compare on this one?"
"4696980","4698480"," We can do a HYG."
"4699120","4699760"," No, not HUG. "
"4701860","4702300"," HYG."
"4705250","4707690"," We change the color of this comparison."
"4712890","4713370"," Compare..."
"4713370","4716630"," I don't know if I can do the colors on this, but..."
"4718230","4720250"," It's blue, but you see this?"
"4720910","4721930"," See this right here?"
"4722030","4722930"," Jeremy's chances of shelters. "
"4723590","4723850"," I'm optimistic."
"4724350","4727490"," The EU and US cameras over the dispute on the climate act."
"4729410","4732170"," If this grows here..."
"4733270","4735550"," If you're looking for a market crash..."
"4737050","4739310"," Are you looking for stagflation?"
"4740490","4745450"," I'm confident that after a lot of work, we will find a response that the EU and US can both"
"4745450","4745890"," live with. "
"4746650","4749450"," If you're looking for stagflation, this is what you'd be looking for."
"4749590","4752810"," Continuation of GNK, HYG to go down."
"4754530","4762450"," Strength in TLT, and you would see the S&P 500 do this kind of a slow sideways and down"
"4762450","4764130"," over time, over the course of a year. "
"4765790","4767470"," And today you're not seeing..."
"4767470","4770310"," You're not seeing that much weakness, man, in TLT."
"4770530","4771930"," With their fortune amounts."
"4772430","4774210"," The bond market is still telling you it's stagflation. "
"4774490","4774930"," We're not crashing."
"4775230","4781710"," They're going to be selling $45 billion worth of four-week bills on, excuse me, so on December 8th,"
"4781730","4783130"," they're going to be selling $45 billion."
"4784150","4786590"," And to settle on December 13th. "
"4791330","4792210"," Look at Dixie."
"4799460","4802360"," You can see the buyers stepped right in on Dixie, right?"
"4804720","4806700"," Man just came right in down here."
"4810320","4813300"," With the pay attention to this again, now we're coming down here with Dixie. "
"4815360","4817180"," Sold it down, sold it down."
"4818460","4819580"," Where are the sellers here?"
"4819760","4820900"," Sellers are even lower."
"4821140","4821920"," Sellers are..."
"4825840","4827460"," No, they didn't sell it down from there. "
"4828120","4829340"," Sellers are really up here."
"4832870","4835270"," Yes, the bears are making some real good progress."
"4836550","4838230"," You get buyers that came in here. "
"4838370","4840090"," You get buyers that came in here."
"4840730","4840810"," Again, they came in here."
"4841890","4845610"," I have to look back in time and see what this line means. "
"4846090","4854470"," This is saying the bears should be looking for another push-up to at least see if the sellers are"
"4854470","4855530"," still waiting here."
"4858960","4860420"," The sellers aren't up here."
"4861940","4867180"," This is where you're going to start getting your legs in a ramp down. "
"4867600","4868780"," This is Dixie moving up here."
"4872120","4877220"," Market bears have some work to do, but this certainly is convincing."
"4882980","4884180"," Strength in the dollar. "
"4884500","4885320"," What else are we looking at?"
"4889570","4894430"," Yes, this is back to this week."
"4894930","4897250"," I guess we've had buyers down here the whole way, right?"
"4898470","4901950"," It's kind of a bull test down here."
"4902230","4903770"," We're not trying the entire way. "
"4904650","4907630"," You're looking to see if the bulls can step back in."
"4908810","4911570"," Still showing some weakness though, right?"
"4911750","4914110"," You're going to expect HYG to at least..."
"4914110","4917290"," Even in previous examples, you'll see HYG just kind of..."
"4918990","4922170"," Those buyers didn't step in until down here."
"4924130","4925090"," So at least..."
"4925090","4929310"," At least some localized weakness in here. "
"4929510","4933630"," You're going to at least expect next day or two, three days."
"4934350","4936330"," I don't think it's unreasonable."
"4937130","4937630"," Hold on a second here. "
"4941000","4942960"," My phone normally doesn't ring."
"4943880","4944660"," Usually have this up."
"4946520","4947680"," I apologize for that. "
"4954980","4959640"," If the bulls are looking for a thrust, you're looking for..."
"4960340","4962540"," HYG is probably going to be a pretty good one for you to watch here."
"4964020","4969800"," For some kind of a bottoming action, I'd be looking at HYG."
"4973130","4975590"," Trend's still in the upward movement for J&K overall. "
"4977030","4978830"," This is for that bull argument."
"4979190","4980030"," Same thing though, right?"
"4980030","4982750"," Same thing that the buyers are down lower."
"4987230","4989090"," That's a lot of room to be coming down. "
"4989950","4991710"," It's kind of a bloodbath move, right?"
"4993770","4998850"," A bloodbath move, you can check these dates going back in history and see what took place on these"
"4998850","4999070"," dates."
"4999250","5001990"," I'm sure these lines lined up with spy bottoms."
"5002770","5005290"," And you still see that there's room, right?"
"5007850","5010590"," For HYG to bleed off. "
"5010590","5017610"," I mean, there's no reason not to think that we can't trade J&K down."
"5017950","5020830"," And that would mean that spy has more to go."
"5021550","5026290"," Spy could easily trade down another hundred points easily with just this right here. "
"5028430","5033610"," This is very bearish in the short time period."
"5035410","5037170"," Bulls haven't given up here though."
"5038310","5042310"," J&K and HYG are saying the bulls still have some kind of a case. "
"5042950","5048530"," I disagree with that personally, but I'd have to be proven wrong at this point that the market's"
"5048530","5049250"," not going to roll over."
"5049930","5053370"," I'd have to see some real constructive work by bulls."
"5059470","5062270"," You've got bears finding a base and the VIX down here, right?"
"5064030","5065450"," Bears try to buy it up here. "
"5065650","5067010"," There's a thrust down below."
"5067010","5067650"," Here's one."
"5068050","5071650"," Another thrust by the bulls are the bears down here. "
"5072510","5074910"," Bears have some work to do to break above here."
"5075350","5079850"," But once they get above here, right, that would be that bloodbath in HYG and J&K."
"5080230","5084010"," There could be another major role in the market coming ahead here. "
"5087070","5094310"," And really the next time there's two places for the bulls to have an inflection point and make"
"5094310","5095570"," market bulls right here and here."
"5096930","5101350"," Otherwise, I'd be looking for at least an attempt by the bears to start getting us up and over."
"5101830","5103830"," And I think we're in some Contango right now too, right?"
"5104610","5107010"," I'm not positive on that, but I think we are. "
"5107150","5107750"," Yeah, it's 2173."
"5108810","5109730"," We've already broken through."
"5111770","5112870"," We've already broken through above. "
"5113610","5114210"," Bears did it here."
"5114530","5115470"," Bears want to be doing it above."
"5116350","5119330"," They're just not showing up on the contract. "
"5119850","5120370"," So here we go."
"5121410","5122370"," Yeah, but yeah."
"5123310","5128830"," This also kind of coincides right here with the bloodbath. "
"5129070","5134710"," If there's a bloodbath in J&K HYG, you'd want to see the VIX stay constructive and move higher to"
"5134710","5138650"," 2382 to 2449."
"5140790","5145150"," Right, so you're looking for the VIX to go higher, looking for the J&K and HYG to continue to"
"5145150","5145670"," roll over."
"5146650","5148910"," There's no reason to not think that's going to happen. "
"5148910","5150170"," At least in the short term."
"5150670","5157290"," So short term weakness in the middle of December into FMC sounds, sounds plausible."
"5160990","5162530"," Not too much happening in. "
"5164530","5166570"," Just that bear stepping down."
"5166850","5172330"," TikTok talks with the US run into more delays and the TikTok deal with Washington had been expected"
"5172330","5173670"," around the year end."
"5174730","5180330"," We had one touch of one touch of 3950. "
"5182930","5187690"," According to the Wall Street Journal, TikTok and the US government are negotiating a deal to reduce"
"5187690","5189170"," national security concerns."
"5191230","5196430"," We've got one tag at 1041 this morning of 395 0."
"5196910","5197770"," No breach yet."
"5197770","5207160"," It looks like it looks like the ghost print is a ghost print down there at"
"5207160","5209360"," 3950 or so. "
"5209740","5211820"," Could have been a tag down here that you don't see."
"5212540","5213520"," That's even lower."
"5214240","5217800"," You might have reached it without even knowing at 3500. "
"5217800","5219580"," So be cut conscience of that."
"5225720","5228760"," I haven't checked the prints down there and see if they got grabbed or not."
"5229840","5232260"," Bernstein sees US recession next year. "
"5246170","5248950"," You did get the low take down there right down here."
"5249010","5249890"," There was the low tech."
"5251110","5253970"," 34 or 394 point eight or a point eight one. "
"5258310","5259510"," Let me see what you guys are writing."
"5266970","5268650"," Let me see if you guys are putting in the chat here."
"5272550","5273790"," Let me scroll back up here. "
"5274870","5275690"," I'm not reading your."
"5275970","5277210"," I was doing some work."
"5277370","5278590"," So I have been reading your comments. "
"5279390","5282270"," So we've also posted out the article from the Wall Street Journal."
"5282950","5285830"," Talking about tick tock talks with the US run."
"5285910","5286470"," It's more delays. "
"5286910","5289910"," Couldn't sources cited by the Wall Street Journal on the knees."
"5290150","5294830"," So I go by saying cap captain answered no sense."
"5295010","5297070"," I would need to see a breakdown below 393. "
"5297490","5302590"," That's the bottom of my setting temporary channel rejection for 10 ends at 393 as the bottom before"
"5302590","5303130"," from seeming."
"5303650","5307990"," Yeah, there's people last night on their people last night on Twitter that was saying."
"5310830","5317950"," That there were some bulls saying that if we had traded up into FOMC that they would be scared for"
"5317950","5319510"," the market for market crash. "
"5320370","5325990"," And that their take is that we're going to sell off into FOMC for a lot much larger move higher."
"5329810","5330730"," How you welcome Juventus."
"5331710","5335350"," Is there any argument there's too much market manipulation that would prevent the market from going"
"5335350","5337430"," below 3600 that would signal a recession. "
"5338330","5340530"," Like in October rocketed up 34 to anyone."
"5340690","5341130"," Yeah, there's."
"5347410","5356010"," I mean, if you they're not talking to a bullpumper or not talking to a bear doomer. "
"5356630","5361510"," If you talk to like an intelligent market person."
"5362630","5365490"," That's a bull and a bear."
"5366050","5366330"," There's. "
"5367870","5369150"," There's still an argument."
"5370690","5372890"," Cable seeing movement towards the upside."
"5373130","5374390"," No headlines to back this. "
"5374850","5379890"," But we are also seeing some just some weakening from the Dixie overall."
"5380370","5381890"," No headlines to back to movement."
"5382290","5387710"," We'll try to keep them now with the for this and we'll let them find the headline for it. "
"5388250","5391550"," Mark, so we can buy another 10 pack here."
"5394690","5396990"," It's not meant meant 20."
"5398750","5399790"," 2400 C's. "
"5399950","5402870"," My average is a 15 cents right now."
"5404390","5408050"," We got the news guys saying that Dixie's weakening."
"5408550","5411530"," You might expect they don't have anything to back this up. "
"5411570","5414750"," But they think there might be a market reversal moving higher now."
"5415070","5416550"," To be aware of that."
"5416630","5418810"," If you're if you're watching this broadcast right now. "
"5419510","5422370"," You've got the new squad is saying that."
"5422950","5424930"," It's possible that the market reverses."
"5426210","5428930"," Be aware you guys are tuning in right now. "
"5429870","5432510"," There is a warning that we're getting a market reversal currently."
"5436570","5437970"," You guys all get that right."
"5438250","5438630"," You heard that. "
"5440010","5441450"," Signs of the market reversing."
"5443290","5444630"," So there's an argument."
"5444890","5447390"," There's some very smart people out there. "
"5447390","5448650"," These are the people that."
"5450110","5454550"," Don't pick market directions, but they're saying that there is chance."
"5456110","5457970"," Of a sideways trade into. "
"5459110","5462570"," At least well, I guess you don't really have to point a finger at it."
"5462570","5463210"," You're just say."
"5464510","5465610"," We'll trade side. "
"5465770","5469190"," We'll trade the market sideways into 2023, 2024, 2025."
"5471810","5475570"," There's there's people saying that money has left."
"5475570","5478110"," So you've got portfolio managers, right?"
"5479590","5483430"," They hid in the DJI. "
"5483570","5485270"," They hit in the Dow Jones industrial average."
"5487290","5489010"," Then you saw like CNBC."
"5489430","5492990"," You see portfolio managers trying to fucking sell. "
"5494750","5499510"," To like, I think I forgot who I figured who said it on Twitter, but they're like, well, I forget"
"5499510","5500050"," his name again."
"5501470","5505230"," He said if my mom, my mom went to the like for bank, whatever."
"5505230","5506530"," The bank was like, you should buy. "
"5507790","5509010"," Or REITs or something."
"5509770","5512810"," I posted on Twitter last week that there was money fleeing REITs."
"5513930","5518710"," And then there's a there's a there's whispers of all the money from REITs. "
"5518830","5521330"," And I think the bank tried to sell REITs or some shit."
"5521510","5524690"," But so money fled REITs for his fleeing REITs."
"5524730","5527950"," And then there's money fleeing DIA. "
"5528910","5533230"," And the question that I asked a week or two ago was, Hey, man, where's all this money going?"
"5534270","5542810"," Because you see money fleeing crypto and you see the collapse of FTX and you see money fleeing"
"5542810","5543230"," REITs."
"5543730","5545250"," Normally you'd see money early."
"5546230","5550790"," Early, you would see money going into REITs with fair with market fairs. "
"5551450","5557470"," So you'll see like this large, large money sneak from place to place trying to hide the cash."
"5558070","5560310"," And you kind of want to track where that money is and where it's going."
"5562830","5565770"," And you see the lift off of TLT. "
"5566530","5574630"," So there's this question is all the money from from these different places now moving into TLT"
"5574630","5575290"," bonds, right?"
"5575610","5576630"," Some high quality shit."
"5580280","5581840"," So I was being asked that question."
"5581980","5583420"," Can we trade it sideways into 2020?"
"5583740","5584200"," Yeah, I think. "
"5584940","5586000"," I think there's."
"5587140","5591000"," There's something to be said for if I was a bank and I had Tesla."
"5591000","5593400"," Let's say, let's say I had a, I don't know. "
"5594260","5596680"," 20, let's say I had like 20 billion in Tesla."
"5597860","5599180"," 50 trillion in Tesla."
"5599640","5601280"," Let's say they had a large position in Tesla. "
"5602460","5604620"," You know, I'd want, I would know that."
"5606560","5611580"," Smaller brokerages, smaller banks will buy at certain levels, right?"
"5611800","5612920"," So I'd try to sell into."
"5614280","5615280"," 180, 175. "
"5616380","5617240"," Take my hand off."
"5617940","5619800"," Sell into 150, 130."
"5620320","5620900"," Take my hand off. "
"5622100","5623400"," And sell into like night."
"5623600","5625480"," Well, maybe not selling to $90, but."
"5626880","5629100"," But then I'm loaded some point down the road. "
"5630920","5633180"," And when is the appropriate time for that?"
"5633320","5634340"," I don't think anyone knows."
"5636520","5638580"," I think they could crash it today."
"5639520","5641400"," Or our economy can shit. "
"5641980","5643140"," And we could be cranking again."
"5643620","5644960"," You know, it doesn't always match up."
"5645100","5646840"," I think the only way you can tell. "
"5649080","5652780"," Well, ISM time, or I think it's ISM against unemployment."
"5652960","5653860"," We'll tell you some stuff."
"5654020","5655000"," We're going to have a stipulation, but. "
"5656340","5660800"," The true only way for you to look for a market crash really is unemployment."
"5662340","5664300"," It's the only tried and true over time."
"5666960","5667360"," Indicator. "
"5668260","5669540"," You're going to see a market crash."
"5670780","5671920"," We haven't seen that yet."
"5673340","5676740"," And unemployment numbers that are coming out have been like muddled and funky. "
"5678280","5681260"," It's not good enough to say, oh, we've got their bad jobs."
"5681480","5682560"," They don't pay well or."
"5683320","5684880"," Quality of the jobs isn't there. "
"5685000","5685500"," That kind of stuff."
"5687420","5690660"," So you really want to you really want to be watching unemployment."
"5692040","5695460"," Unemployment for me is kind of like, this is when we're getting our market crash. "
"5696220","5702260"," You could easily overlay a chart over SPX and go back in history and you'll see where they happen."
"5702800","5703420"," It's pretty consistent."
"5703960","5708600"," It's not like, oh, it happened eight times out of ten or happened five times out of ten. "
"5710240","5712880"," Which is common with bond yields."
"5713160","5716880"," Bond yields don't always tell the truth on getting a market crash."
"5717000","5718540"," Unemployment is kind of like the most consistent one. "
"5719940","5724380"," Brent crude drops to $80.54 lowest since January."
"5724780","5726260"," Question about rolling options."
"5726640","5730320"," When is that advantage simply take the loss and open another position when you feel more"
"5730320","5731460"," comfortable with your environment?"

"5747960","5752640"," How much you're willing to lose before you change your view. "
"5756520","5759500"," Is it just throwing good money after bad when the trend is still opposite?"
"5759840","5763580"," Why wouldn't you just sell it, sit it out, then buy again later?"
"5763960","5764820"," I've sold this already."
"5765240","5766180"," I'm making tons of money."
"5766400","5767820"," That's me, I guess, if you're asking me. "
"5772280","5778360"," I think they will pump crypto like Bitcoin over $25K then dump $3.85 instead of $3.03 in my"
"5778360","5779000"," comment before."
"5779660","5780240"," I missed that comment."
"5782420","5783540"," Oh, I see what you're saying. "
"5783620","5788960"," It wasn't $3.93, it was $3.95. Shouldn't Vix be rising with the market being down so much."
"5789140","5789720"," Yeah, it is rising."
"5790200","5792420"," I was on the wrong time frame in that chart. "
"5794120","5794940"," Vix is rising."
"5796960","5798820"," About to break, $3.85 support."
"5799120","5801720"," Here comes the 500-plus to win the Q-swing shorts. "

"5811220","5812320"," So far I'm full bear camp. "
"5812540","5814840"," So Matthew is switching to full bear camp at this point."
"5815780","5817160"," Because you've breached at least, right?"
"5817300","5817920"," You've had the peak below."
"5819600","5820860"," Yeah, I think it's fair to be. "
"5821200","5827020"," I think you should be shifting at this point from bull to bear at least."
"5829360","5833920"," You've got, who is asking this question above here?"
"5837240","5843700"," Poor Badger is asking about or is it just throwing good money after bad when the trend is still"
"5843700","5844080"," opposite?"
"5844680","5847200"," Yeah, so the trend hasn't been opposite."
"5849260","5851980"," So poor Badger is asking the question about trend. "
"5852440","5854500"," You have to ask the question on multiple time frames."
"5856500","5863340"," There's no, I don't know about, I don't know, I don't think you could be short from January 4th."
"5863980","5866460"," And your broker would have allowed you to be short the entire time. "
"5866720","5868820"," Even the banks haven't been short."
"5869720","5873120"," You take your shorts when you're supposed to, you close your shorts for profit, you re-enter where"
"5873120","5873780"," you're supposed to."
"5874240","5875380"," So I think you have different time frames. "
"5875840","5881300"," When you're asking when you should be a bear, when you should be a bull, it's always time frame."
"5883000","5884100"," When you're bear in your bull."
"5885520","5891180"," I think it's absurd to be bull or bear for paying them on what your positioning is and length of"
"5891180","5891800"," time in your position. "
"5891800","5893700"," So it's kind of like a weird question."
"5895880","5897520"," I voted no because of blood red."
"5898860","5900140"," Oh, you're tired of blood red?"
"5900420","5901800"," Yeah, I feel that, Brad. "
"5902460","5907880"," I think most, so most of the bulls in my personal life, I guess, yeah, it's my personal life."
"5908040","5912060"," Most of the bulls that I know want to market crash."
"5912360","5914260"," I don't know any serious bull. "
"5914460","5916780"," Like people with real money that are longtime market participants."
"5917880","5922660"," They just kind of wanted a dip that they can buy and go back to their lives and not worry"
"5922660","5924640"," about it for three to five years or ten years or whatever."
"5925860","5926780"," So that's hard, Brad. "
"5927380","5928300"," I feel you on that."
"5929140","5930700"," I think we're going to 393 today."
"5930880","5931880"," But it's break three to five sport. "
"5932180","5933460"," Here comes 500 plus swing."
"5934820","5936000"," What else are we looking at here?"
"5938000","5939540"," Yeah, we could look at multiple times."
"5939800","5940820"," You really want to look in front. "
"5941000","5943620"," If you're looking for like 10 year, 20 or 30 year."
"5946520","5951640"," Charts, you really want to be looking for like cyclical charts, cycle charts that can accommodate"
"5951640","5952580"," where we actually are."
"5954500","5956760"," Matt Phillips, the instructor does seem to have broken down. "
"5957300","5958900"," Completely agree with you could have a bounce."
"5959160","5960660"," Yeah, I don't have a smaller time frame."
"5961280","5962320"," I'm expecting a bounce in here. "
"5962540","5963420"," I really don't care if it sells."
"5963640","5965700"," I don't care if it sells to the depths of hell under the clothes today."
"5966460","5967220"," You're going to get it. "
"5967280","5968080"," You're going to catch a bounce."
"5969420","5974460"," But I think the idea being that the market's rolling over."
"5975080","5978100"," I think it's hard not to say at this point the market's not rolling over. "
"5978360","5983080"," I think this is, I think you measure where you're like, take your, well, in the longer time frame,"
"5983600","5984880"," like a medium time frame."
"5985420","5986540"," Are we going to roll this market over?"
"5986760","5986960"," We are."
"5987600","5988520"," That's a fucking lutely. "
"5992860","5996900"," The question being a wonderful OCPR, Devoshev from the complete reverse structure."
"5997680","5999600"," Yeah, on a small time frame."
"5999600","6001640"," So if we go into FMC, right?"
"6002900","6007040"," And they cut rates, which is, believe it or not, possible. "
"6008340","6009220"," They could pause rates."
"6009420","6010520"," There's all kinds of shit they could do."
"6011820","6016140"," You could see, there's some positive events for bulls. "
"6017840","6020420"," And there's landmines for bears as time moves on."
"6020540","6021120"," There's landmines."
"6021820","6028600"," First landmine would be if FMC does any kind of perceived by the market. "
"6029360","6031200"," As a dovish signal."
"6032220","6034920"," But they haven't already stated."
"6035520","6037140"," So they've stated 50 BPS. "
"6037800","6043400"," They come in and say we're pausing this month, this month, or we're fucking going to 25 BPS."
"6044220","6046360"," Or anything, anything like that."
"6047360","6051100"," You could see an initial rip in the market. "
"6052640","6055760"," I think that was part of the talk from the Twitter crowd."
"6055900","6062000"," The Twitter bull crowd was, I'd be scared if we were trading up in FMC."
"6062420","6063620"," We're selling down on FMC. "
"6064260","6065920"," There's likely going to be some news."
"6067320","6068860"," The banks probably know this news."
"6069540","6072080"," So you've got a Wilson out there going. "
"6072940","6075520"," Well, I'm going to step into the market and tell them I'm selling into it."
"6076180","6079180"," So it publicly comes out, which is manipulation, right?"
"6079400","6080620"," Stock manipulation, but whatever."
"6081060","6087240"," So what you do is instead you come out and say, all right, I want to sell 440, 430, something"
"6087240","6087580"," like that. "
"6087720","6090600"," I already know they're going to do something completely unknown."
"6091780","6094480"," We're going to sell right now into the FMC."
"6094960","6098780"," And then once we're selling the FMC, we've got everybody believe in that it's going to be a"
"6098780","6099180"," bloodbath. "
"6100740","6102460"," And then along this stock market."
"6103640","6106780"," We're going to have a face dripper off FMC go up three, four hundred points."
"6107340","6112620"," I'm going to sell into that into that strength one more time and this unloading process that banks"
"6112620","6112920"," are doing. "
"6113080","6113560"," Yeah, I'm sure."
"6113780","6115180"," I guess that's possible."
"6119200","6121260"," I would be wary though of it. "
"6121660","6125440"," That's the so in that same conversation, Matthew."
"6125440","6134260"," If you see anything that's that the market perceives as, as dovish and the market rips higher, I"
"6134260","6140400"," would expect within two weeks for us to revert back to the trend down."
"6142020","6146180"," Within two weeks, if anything, it could trigger a market crash. "
"6147980","6149700"," That's when I would say market crash."
"6150600","6155160"," If they say at that meeting, like some serious, like we're down to 25 VPS."
"6155320","6157040"," We're going to stop the terminal rate. "
"6157240","6157740"," We're going to stop."
"6158040","6158340"," I don't know."
"6158440","6158880"," We're going to fucking. "
"6159160","6160960"," We're going to institute QE."
"6161140","6167680"," If you ever say something like we're instituting QE or something insane, we'll probably have a"
"6167680","6170480"," quick rep higher, huge liquidity grab."
"6171060","6173680"," And then you'll probably see a fucking market meltdown. "
"6175020","6177980"," So when I say that statement, I always get surprised by bears."
"6178660","6180640"," Some like bears like doom, doom, doom."
"6180880","6183360"," I'm like, you should be wanting QE. "
"6184140","6188160"," If you got QE, you get your market crash."
"6189180","6189620"," Guaranteed."
"6190720","6191160"," Guaranteed. "
"6191320","6192080"," You'd see a reset of pricing."
"6194260","6196380"," So I'm always at odds with what bears."
"6196700","6199520"," I'm not all bears, but a lot of bears out there. "
"6199520","6203540"," I'm like, you're asking for the wrong things to get your market crash."
"6204360","6204700"," In my view."
"6206280","6210740"," Or at least historically in my experience, you're asking the wrong questions. "
"6212780","6219640"," Or what you're wanting, you're looking for the wrong events to take place."
"6222580","6225200"," There's always some most of the arguments for a market crash."
"6225400","6226860"," I'm like, that's not what you're looking for. "
"6231060","6237500"," So yeah, you would probably lean in really heavy if they did something like that on a high."
"6239200","6247150"," If there was some kind of a huge shift in policy that we don't know, I'd get extremely bearish."
"6249590","6252170"," Yeah, on that rep too, I'd get extremely bearish. "
"6253050","6258650"," And I would expect the rip, and then I would be like, I'd probably be the guy walking down with"
"6258650","6260310"," a sign on him, bringing my bell going."
"6260810","6262950"," We're getting a market crash the next few weeks, I promise."
"6269090","6270630"," Hey CSM Jazz, how are you, brother?"
"6276280","6278120"," Hey, Winky just came back into the stream. "
"6278360","6279240"," I saw your sick message."
"6279800","6285200"," Brought this dropping, time to buy a B&O, seeking swing long ad on MCO."
"6286440","6288260"," Boring late to the party as usual. "
"6288660","6289080"," What's the plan for today?"
"6289280","6289800"," Hey, how are you?"
"6290040","6290360"," Good morning."
"6291280","6293300"," We've been going through a bunch of different shit this morning."
"6295260","6303200"," We've had a trend reversal on a what would you call it like a medium time frame. "
"6305880","6307440"," We can trade higher after CPI."
"6307940","6310940"," CPI will be a more important event as J-POW will follow those results."
"6311880","6313660"," That's a great conversation, by the way. "
"6318410","6318650"," I don't."
"6318870","6319530"," I don."
"6320290","6322090"," I'm sorry if I'm pronouncing the name wrong. "
"6322630","6324550"," It says I think we trade higher after the CPI."
"6324890","6328710"," CPI will be a more important event as J-POW will follow those results."
"6329030","6334370"," We had a conversation yesterday about the importance of J-POW and fed speakers as well. "
"6334370","6348150"," And when there's more dissent, less dissent or if they're trying to cover their own asses by"
"6348150","6353250"," having wide, wide dissent, unless we got going on in the stream in here."
"6357010","6358030"," You broke 395."
"6359030","6363450"," I would expect the big guys to hide their bearish bets to not hit those indicators for market"
"6363450","6363830"," crash. "
"6364370","6365830"," Oh, nothing is broken yet."
"6366250","6368090"," Crash not likely agree with you in the next three months."
"6369410","6370310"," Uh, situation. "
"6370490","6370870"," Yeah."
"6371250","6373410"," Uh, you know, just on a longer time frame."
"6375350","6377610"," Uh, oil prices extend losses. "
"6378450","6380830"," USWTI now down more than two dollars."
"6384030","6386030"," A longer time frame or near a bottom."
"6388370","6390270"," I don't know what that price is. "
"6390430","6392310"," I'm not really concerned with the price, but we're close."
"6392310","6396750"," We're close like, we're close like this year."
"6397970","6405270"," I would suspect between now into 2025, you're going to get that moment where we get a capitulation. "
"6405730","6407910"," I don't know when it is, but I think it's then."
"6408890","6413610"," I really, so I talk sometimes in stream about the timing is off."
"6413810","6414410"," Timing is wrong. "
"6414610","6415030"," Timing is wrong."
"6415270","6415610"," Time is wrong."
"6416390","6420950"," You really want to see like so fucking horrible to say this. "
"6420950","6421190"," But."
"6422230","6424390"," You want to see people like not be able to pay their credit cards."
"6425090","6425630"," You want. "
"6426270","6427650"," Get free daily points."
"6427970","6432630"," The banachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick.com."
"6432890","6434130"," You want to see, um."
"6435770","6438830"," You want to see people having, let's say like a second or third mortgage. "
"6439250","6441350"," So you try what you're trying to do is you're not trying to crash the housing market."
"6441550","6443710"," You're trying to clean out bad debt."
"6444690","6450610"," That's been accumulated by people from their 20s and 30s into their 40s and 50s. "
"6450870","6452530"," This is for people at least, right?"
"6452730","6453750"," We're not talking about companies yet."
"6455070","6457930"," So you need this like class of people that's slightly older."
"6458170","6462490"," They're like 50 years old, let's say 60 years old, 70 years old. "
"6463150","6465350"," They've accumulated a ton of debt over their lives."
"6465550","6468350"," They're at the end usually of their working lives."
"6470110","6471770"," This is horrible shit to say. "
"6472510","6476610"," But they get laid off because they're being replaced by someone cheaper and younger."
"6479130","6483390"," They're getting replaced because maybe technology has to move forward."
"6484550","6489130"," They might be being replaced just because of ageism, right?"
"6489430","6489730"," Ageism. "
"6490670","6494470"," Maybe they're not expected to work in another 20 or 30 or 40 years."
"6495610","6496970"," So the potential out of that worker, right?"
"6498370","6499730"," All horrible things to say."
"6500210","6505970"," But they've, of course, accumulated debt over the years and they might have, this could be a woman,"
"6506110","6506190"," right?"
"6506610","6510730"," Maybe just just like, same time she doesn't like her husband anymore or he doesn't like his wife"
"6510730","6511050"," anymore. "
"6512470","6513650"," His house, right?"
"6514210","6515150"," You ever go to some people's houses?"
"6516170","6519350"," They look great in the street and you realize that they've had that house for 20, 30 years."
"6519490","6520830"," They've never sold it, raised the family there."
"6521570","6522250"," He needs major renovations. "
"6523230","6528330"," They're just waiting for the next cycle of inflation to come down so they can make these fixes."
"6528690","6533050"," As a matter of fact, I'm not going to say who."
"6533330","6537250"," I have a family member who has a lot of property. "
"6538270","6546490"," Very wealthy and she's got multiple properties where you go look at them and it's like, especially"
"6546490","6551310"," right now you're like, you know, this is going to cost you what the house would have given you for"
"6551310","6551650"," profit."
"6551650","6555790"," According to into facts, Russia says that they won't be limited."
"6556170","6559630"," They won't limit its self responding to oil price cap. "
"6559970","6564790"," It says, Rybakov commenting on report Russia may set minimum or minimum oil price."
"6565530","6571870"," Also, that was I effect, citing debt from Mr. Rybakov on oil price cap."
"6572570","6576490"," So you're so you know, she's got equity in this house, right?"
"6577150","6577910"," Did all the right things. "
"6580630","6584230"," Get you know, if you get your roof done, you get new windows in these these days, right?"
"6584330","6586330"," It's like $30,000, $50,000 roof."
"6586550","6589450"," It's like $60,000, $70,000 for new windows."
"6590710","6591370"," New kitchen. "
"6591810","6595530"," Those are 60 50 60 $70,000 right now."
"6595530","6597210"," New bathroom 20 30 40,000."
"6597670","6598250"," That's the low end. "
"6598710","6599930"," And these are in nice neighborhoods."
"6600670","6603110"," And so you're like, let's cut 100 grand right there and."
"6603110","6605910"," They're buyers out there right now. "
"6605970","6606710"," So you've got people with debt."
"6607210","6608210"," You want to clear those people out."
"6608370","6610310"," So you're looking for signs of that yourself. "
"6610690","6612390"," If you are, we're talking about market cash right here."
"6612770","6614350"," So what you're looking for is."
"6616250","6618490"," For market cash, you're looking for that stuff to happen. "
"6618950","6622170"," You're looking to see people get cleaned out, right?"
"6623070","6624330"," They're debt to be removed."
"6624670","6625690"," They're bad debt to remove."
"6626710","6628210"," And them to be taken out. "
"6628210","6634850"," So like taken out basically so that a new generation of people can step in and assume risky debt."
"6635530","6637030"," And we haven't seen that yet."
"6637770","6639410"," So that's why you're looking at that unemployment number. "
"6639550","6641150"," You can see that in your normal lives."
"6641350","6643890"," If you sit, you hear it like you're on like Reddit or something."
"6644470","6646570"," You'll see people bitching about the cost of stuff. "
"6647430","6651990"," You'll see people bitching about how high their taxes are bitching about how high their mortgages"
"6651990","6654650"," are bitching about all kinds of shit."
"6655210","6657490"," There'll be a market difference in what you're hearing."
"6657490","6659690"," People will start talking about, hey, I'm losing my house. "
"6660090","6661170"," I've lost my second house."
"6661610","6663450"," I've lost my fucking $200,000 truck."
"6664430","6665470"," All that kind of stuff. "
"6666090","6669050"," And until you hear that stuff, you shouldn't expect that."
"6672310","6679490"," You shouldn't expect that that crash."
"6680670","6683790"," As an adult, the first real one that I was aware of it was in Vail. "
"6683990","6685510"," I was living in Vail's Enron."
"6686730","6692370"," Enron owned a track of houses up in Beaver Creek."
"6696430","6705470"," And the people that came to Vail, to ski, you see people come from South America, right?"
"6705650","6707310"," They would buy brand new everything. "
"6708010","6712150"," You're talking like thousands and thousands of dollars of fucking ski equipment."
"6712150","6715710"," And just dump it at the bottom of the hill before they get on a plane."
"6716170","6717370"," A private jet out of there. "
"6718650","6723870"," You'd go out to eat with people and they would be buying bottle after bottle of champagne of a"
"6723870","6724450"," Christal."
"6724670","6727050"," They'd buy a Louis tray, rounds of Louis tray."
"6727210","6730390"," You're talking like a shot of Louis tray is, I don't know what that is. "
"6730810","6731170"," It was some stupid."
"6731390","6736310"," It was almost, you know, a thousand bucks a shot or something, a thirteen hundred bucks a shot or"
"6736310","6736490"," something."
"6739330","6744350"," Some of the wines, you'd see wines being passed around that were fifteen, sixteen thousand dollars,"
"6744550","6745470"," twenty thousand dollars. "
"6745750","6747950"," Like, we're just drinking this shit, right?"
"6753110","6756830"," And one day all the, and then there was this other class of rich."
"6757030","6758970"," This is like real wealth, generational wealth."
"6759350","6760290"," Most people never did that stuff. "
"6761650","6764790"," They've been coming to Vail for years and years and years raised kids, all this other nonsense."
"6764790","6769770"," You'd see like Ford had a, or there's a presidential house up there or something or a lodge."
"6769770","6772310"," Presidential lodge at the top of the mountain. "
"6772870","6774250"," We've got the name of that fucking place anymore."
"6775390","6776490"," Like, Ford would go up there."
"6776650","6779770"," You'd have like, you'd have like different kinds of classes of wealth up there. "
"6779870","6784790"," But I remember when that crash happened, there was like two market things that happened."
"6785310","6788670"," You just saw, like, pissing money away wealth disappear."
"6789430","6790010"," New money disappeared. "
"6790430","6791190"," Those people are just gone."
"6791990","6792810"," They were just gone."
"6792810","6794990"," Like one day there, one day gone. "
"6795690","6798750"," You saw real wealth stay, but be more frugal."
"6799510","6803690"," And then you even saw a push from Vail, the community and the ski resorts."
"6804390","6806590"," They tried to attract working class young families. "
"6807950","6808530"," They could be nurses."
"6808870","6809890"," They could be PAs."
"6810210","6811130"," They could be an engineer. "
"6811470","6817350"," But they were like geared towards, you know, you're not going to see like an engineer with a wife"
"6817350","6819090"," and kids or a husband and kids."
"6819090","6822450"," And they're slamming the crystal on the regular, right?"
"6823950","6831370"," And I just saw an article last week from some club owners down in Miami that said that all the"
"6831370","6832890"," crypto bros have disappeared."
"6833950","6835370"," So that's the first sign. "
"6835610","6837910"," Or a do to says there will be further rate hikes."
"6838950","6842750"," That's the first sign of some real danger in our community."
"6843230","6847570"," Whenever you see that new money start disappearing, it's a different kind of wealth. "
"6847570","6851910"," When you see that, when you see that, those people just like poof disappear."
"6852730","6853990"," That's the first signs and cracks."
"6854390","6857730"," The second sign and crack that you're looking for is your neighbors in your neighborhood. "
"6858290","6861830"," You're looking for on social media, people saying, I'm losing my house and losing my truck bar."
"6862310","6864050"," I can't afford to roll this loan."
"6864250","6868810"," This $120,000 truck loan into a new $120,000 truck loan. "
"6868950","6871130"," There's a guy following Twitter that's a used car king or something."
"6871930","6874970"," And he's saying that used car prices are coming down."
"6874970","6879790"," So if you bought a $120,000 truck, $140,000 truck and you're looking to roll into a new one,"
"6880150","6883030"," you're going to be shocked to find out that they're not going to be offering you 110. "
"6883470","6884830"," Right now they are, but you're going to be shocked."
"6885690","6891330"," If in like a six months a year or so, you go, you're like, I'm going to just wait this"
"6891330","6894010"," out and you go to go to roll it over into a new truck."
"6894070","6898530"," He says it's too early to determine the size of the December hike. "
"6901630","6905370"," And they're saying to you, well, we're going to roll another $40,000 or $60,000 into your new loan"
"6905370","6906750"," and your $120,000 truck."
"6906850","6907730"," Now you're going to have a $180,000."
"6908230","6908930"," That's what you kind of want to see. "
"6909070","6913230"," So you kind of want to see like auto loan foreclosures."
"6914550","6916250"," You want to see them like the middle class."
"6918850","6919690"," Kind of play my way. "
"6919750","6920250"," Go through the roof."
"6923950","6928390"," Horrible to say that, Mr. says there's no sign of wage price spiral now."
"6931590","6934770"," This bottom bottoms trying to reclaim itself over here. "
"6935550","6937430"," Let's see if this can hold here."
"6940190","6943730"," Comments and employment, 20 something's missing from market, not going to school."
"6944670","6946510"," Last last three or increases. "
"6947230","6948050"," Yeah, I noticed that."
"6948210","6949690"," Did you notice that there's a million?"
"6950610","6952910"," You guys know, so Floyd's garage is bringing up a comment."
"6952910","6956670"," He said, I commented on unemployment, 20 something's missing from market. "
"6957050","6960770"," Yeah, there's a million new entries into the workforce right now."
"6960770","6963870"," Did you guys, you guys go through the, I don't know if you guys go through employment numbers, but"
"6963870","6967310"," there's like a million new and million new people entering the job market."
"6967310","6968230"," They haven't taken jobs. "
"6969610","6975710"," Now, as a matter of fact, I have a pressure requests, UN security council meeting on December the"
"6975710","6976690"," 9th, according to tasks."
"6978170","6981630"," I have a daughter that's coming into an age where she should be getting the job."
"6981870","6984190"," Once meeting on Western weapons applies to Ukraine. "
"6985610","6987290"," I just had a conversation with my wife."
"6988330","6992210"," We were talking about, so last night she's turning, she's coming to be in 16."
"6993550","6994670"," And where we live right now. "
"6997470","6998770"," There's two things."
"6999130","7005510"," She's, well, she's like volunteers and she's working on these science projects that were coding"
"7005510","7006430"," projects and stuff."
"7006430","7007910"," For college and university. "
"7008910","7010790"," She swims and plays tennis and stuff."
"7011690","7015950"," But we have, we're having these conversations about our oldest daughter and."
"7016950","7017770"," So here. "
"7018690","7024350"," Where we live currently, the system of the state system is basically set up for a child not to"
"7024350","7024630"," drive."
"7026310","7031010"," Insurance here for a child is 5, 4,500 to $5,000 a year."
"7031750","7032570"," They need to have a car. "
"7033530","7036510"," They have their driving driver's ed."
"7038950","7041210"," Insurance purchase their expensive car."
"7042230","7044410"," And then they can't drive alone until they're like 18. "
"7047210","7049170"," Like they can't drive with their friends."
"7049390","7051450"," They can only go like to and from."
"7052090","7054350"," I think school and our kids, we homeschool. "
"7056550","7062290"," So there's nowhere that she can legally and drive technically legally drive without us in the car."
"7062290","7064630"," So it's more of a vanity thing."
"7064770","7067130"," It's like, well, how much is this going to cost?"
"7068970","7072570"," 15, $20,000 for our child to have something that's vanity. "
"7073390","7076110"," Now the state knows that the state is like, we don't want kids driving."
"7078310","7081530"," But if you want your child to drive, this is what's going to cost and we're going to tax you"
"7081530","7082170"," for it, basically."
"7085090","7087610"," So we have young people that aren't entering the workforce. "
"7087610","7089230"," You know, I can't understand."
"7089510","7090650"," I can't fathom."
"7092090","7095390"," Let's say you graduate high school and you're 17. "
"7096770","7098970"," And you're trying to go into a workforce."
"7100650","7105750"," And you basically have an immediate nut for just a vehicle of almost $20,000."
"7106230","7111550"," It could be lower overall, but just that dauntingness of that for a young person is wild, right?"
"7113330","7116530"," And so what we're doing is we are. "
"7117770","7119290"," We're like, don't focus on a car."
"7119290","7122850"," A quantity of tightening must be clear and transparent."
"7123530","7127530"," We're like, save your, save your money for what's more mostly important to you. "
"7127890","7128090"," Text right."
"7128430","7133010"," Text right allows you to actually hear order flame futures for ex and stock instruments."
"7133910","7136230"," Get a free trial at tickstrike.com."
"7136970","7138470"," So we're like, well, what's most important?"
"7138470","7143930"," You could save this money and have, you know, be partying with your friends at college, a party. "
"7144090","7146590"," But you know, if you want to go out somewhere, you're going to have some extra cash, right?"
"7147510","7151310"," If you got stupid expensive textbooks, you could easily use this money towards that."
"7151890","7152670"," We can drive you places."
"7152690","7153410"," You can take Uber. "
"7154290","7154850"," Also, they're nonsense."
"7155430","7157570"," But for a young person, that's brutal."
"7158330","7159510"," I'm told they're not to get a job. "
"7159670","7161330"," I'm like, there's no point in you're getting a job right now."
"7163410","7165110"," And what does she need that money for?"
"7165290","7167990"," So there's this whole class of young people that can't even it."
"7167990","7168650"," Truly. "
"7168910","7171030"," And then you should see the degrees we're talking about."
"7171210","7176130"," We originated with, I think we're staying pre-med, but we wanted to get some kind of a degree that"
"7176130","7179530"," she can make money with alongside it."
"7183370","7187750"," Because I'm like, you know, if you have to have the, you can't go to university right now. "
"7187970","7189750"," Just get a liberal arts degree."
"7190050","7192330"," Any recession likely to be short and mild."
"7193810","7197050"," And accept the accept being paid less than $90,000. "
"7198010","7200530"," You have to have some kind of degree that's going to pay you money."
"7201310","7204270"," Have the ability for you to go to higher education, make even more money."
"7206210","7208290"," Or else she's not going to survive on her own. "
"7208290","7208750"," She won't."
"7211170","7216090"," So, you know, we need to clear out all this whole debt for these kids to have their own chance"
"7216090","7217370"," at some free money."
"7218330","7219750"," And free opportunities, right?"
"7220270","7220950"," That next generation. "
"7222270","7224230"," We'll talk about companies later on."
"7224970","7226170"," We haven't seen that yet."
"7226510","7228410"," But you want to see companies that same thing happen. "
"7228610","7229170"," You want to see companies."
"7230230","7233210"," Some of you guys think that Tesla's a fraud, right?"
"7233510","7240390"," But it'll be a hard microscope looking at a lot of these companies to see if they produce, when"
"7240390","7244170"," there's another whole argument about they don't care about free money."
"7244170","7246090"," But there's going to be an argument. "
"7246330","7250650"," But there's going to be an inspection of these companies and say, hey, you know, during loose or"
"7250650","7254590"," monetary financial conditions, did you produce a product?"
"7255070","7256370"," And do you have some stuff in the pipeline?"
"7257390","7260690"," Are you cutting your staff and able to still produce that kind of stuff?"
"7261150","7262590"," So you can cut that fat as well."
"7262830","7265610"," There's like whole commercial side to this where you want to cut."
"7266070","7269950"," You want to dump companies like Peton that didn't just decided they didn't want to make a bicycle,"
"7270290","7271470"," you know, stuff like that. "
"7273030","7275610"," And that stuff hasn't happened yet either."
"7275730","7281150"," So cyclically, we're not quite at the market crash point in my viewpoint."
"7282290","7282790"," Okay. "
"7282850","7284230"," So right here, we're watching."
"7285070","7287570"," You could call this consolidation in here."
"7287910","7289930"," You could call this grinding. "
"7290610","7294030"," There's all kinds of people to tell you what this is right here."
"7294310","7296370"," There's going to tell you that you're getting some rejection here."
"7296370","7302030"," You're turning some kind of a support level here into a resistance level. "
"7302050","7303950"," If you're a bull, you want to be careful of this in here."
"7304370","7310510"," If they start to turn this level grind through, start to turn this into resistance, you're going to"
"7310510","7312650"," see much, much lower lows down here."
"7312730","7313730"," You want to be really careful of this. "
"7314430","7317730"," Bulls are going to tell you we're just bottoming here looking for a rip higher."
"7318250","7322050"," We'll trade it sideways into the bell maybe and then we'll start ripping there after."
"7322470","7324210"," You want to be real careful of this right here. "
"7324210","7327590"," If you're a bull, this is looking to me like a truck."
"7328390","7330130"," There's some real concern here."
"7330250","7331390"," We'll look lower here. "
"7333610","7337210"," This is likely going to look here."
"7338170","7342670"," This is likely bears are looking for this last move down below here."
"7342910","7348210"," Bond falls to three spots, six, three percent lowest since August the 26th. "
"7348210","7350710"," Three ninety one oh nine."
"7359570","7361710"," We'll leave this here and see what happens here."
"7362670","7368230"," Just to repeat, Italian 10 year government bond yield falls to three spots, six, three, nine"
"7368230","7371030"," percent lowest since August the 26th. "
"7372790","7374530"," That's what you guys are saying the stream."
"7378910","7380670"," Just off our trend line extreme."
"7381070","7382930"," My trades will prove to be premature. "
"7382930","7385150"," You're still in those foreign seas."
"7385730","7387650"," Yeah, I've got a 400 C's."
"7388130","7391350"," I've still got 400 C's and I've got four or two C's. "
"7391470","7392070"," I'll hold them into the bell."
"7396850","7397830"," Your noise is yesterday."
"7398070","7398790"," I got trouble with my wife. "
"7403030","7404610"," Longing CCL pray for me."
"7405670","7406570"," We can look at."
"7408990","7410690"," Give me to buy some throws. "
"7411010","7411470"," I'll throw."
"7411470","7416310"," I'm totally down to be throwing like five cent calls on and twenty cent calls."
"7417510","7419350"," We've got some four or two and four hundred. "
"7419630","7421330"," Canadian banks twenty twenty three six."
"7421530","7423030"," I'm going to grab some three ninety sevens."
"7423170","7423810"," It's all small money. "
"7424050","7426630"," So this stuff is going through."
"7427490","7428070"," Wait a minute here."
"7428790","7431410"," It's trying to have me buy a bunch of different stuff at the same time. "
"7432810","7433750"," What's going on here?"
"7434850","7436130"," I don't want to buy."
"7436490","7436690"," Nope."
"7437170","7437670"," I don't want to buy that. "
"7446090","7447970"," I've got some three ninety seven C's."
"7448050","7452050"," I've got some four hundred C's and some four or two's."
"7457790","7460670"," You know what happens when we have two straight selling days to buy. "
"7460770","7461250"," It's oversold."
"7461410","7462510"," There's always an oversold bounce."
"7463370","7463610"," Yeah. "
"7464610","7468250"," So when you guys hear me talk here, we're talking on different timeframes."
"7468330","7472050"," I want you to be aware of different timeframes."
"7472050","7473430"," I know about stretch. "
"7476230","7482810"," I think sometimes when I'm talking to you guys, you want to hear something that it's not."
"7485890","7488310"," Pension funds have so much risky death moment."
"7489530","7490010"," Yeah. "
"7490150","7493970"," I haven't looked too far into pension funds."
"7494310","7495950"," I think they want to save them to some extent."
"7496410","7497030"," Let me just second here. "
"7521680","7522260"," There's a."
"7523720","7524980"," Someone's bringing up pension funds."
"7525220","7526820"," I'd like to, you know, I haven't been down that rabbit hole."
"7527040","7527880"," I'd like to. "
"7528800","7530120"," Maybe you can tell us about it."
"7530180","7530420"," Superman."
"7532420","7533300"," I haven't. "
"7533300","7541370"," I haven't looked to the closest I look at pension funds."
"7541410","7544530"," I know that portfolio managers are running around the market right now."
"7545070","7546010"," I've been hiding in places. "
"7548750","7550810"," I know that, you know, they hold pension funds."
"7551170","7552970"," Well, I guess the bond guys do too."
"7553510","7554910"," The bond guys got fucked up. "
"7556730","7557790"," I know there's money."
"7557930","7558710"," I know there's big money."
"7559630","7562310"," From pension funds trying to trying to scare you around the market. "
"7563110","7565070"," I've been doing it for like two, three years, right?"
"7566290","7568870"," And they get a post on Twitter about the original."
"7569950","7570830"," Read buying."
"7572190","7573110"," That went on. "
"7573210","7574830"," And now we're seeing the reed selling, right?"
"7575830","7577170"," They're trying to unload that shit."
"7579270","7580970"," I'm fascinated by the pension market."
"7582210","7584430"," I don't know how much that is a public information. "
"7584890","7588270"," I feel like I feel like I'm constantly out there trying to find that money."
"7588750","7589510"," Where is it?"
"7589610","7590050"," Where is it hiding?"
"7592050","7595230"," Maybe you're maybe you're making a positive that it's like all loaded."
"7596130","7597950"," It's all loaded in a Tesla or something. "
"7597950","7598710"," Maybe it is."
"7598810","7599130"," I don't know."
"7599670","7600490"," It could not. "
"7601390","7607010"," Canadian banks says expects that the net interest margins will continue to expand, but has a slower"
"7607010","7609070"," place to blow up in the bond market."
"7609070","7610970"," Now it's being shuttled around."
"7611110","7612130"," I don't know the answers to that question. "
"7612350","7613310"," I'm fascinated by it though."
"7613670","7614830"," If you have information on it."
"7615670","7617630"," Post it and ping me on Twitter. "
"7618470","7620930"," Or if you have any articles or any data that I can look at it."

"7628950","7629590"," Discord link."
"7629750","7632690"," I'll try to get one out to you this afternoon if I can on Twitter."
"7632910","7633370"," I'll post one. "
"7639070","7640150"," That's the top signal."
"7640830","7641890"," Crypto and cleaned out."
"7642030","7642830"," Yeah, the crypto bros. "
"7642950","7643770"," I'll try to find it."
"7643930","7646450"," I think I don't know if it was Forbes to put the article out."
"7647110","7649670"," There was or maybe it was New York Times or WAPO. "
"7649830","7650250"," I'm not sure."
"7650370","7655850"," But there was an article about the crypto or there were some nightclubs in Miami or something that"
"7655850","7657290"," said that the crypto bros have disappeared."
"7657910","7660090"," And that they were doing these stupid fucking parties. "
"7661410","7663330"," Like just like $3 million bill."
"7664090","7665750"," Fucking million dollar bills."
"7666750","7669570"," It's been insane amounts and like one drop in a night. "
"7672280","7676040"," And then they were saying I think one of these nightclub owners was saying something like."
"7676940","7678640"," Highest bill I've had is 15 grand."
"7678900","7682500"," I used to have I was handing out you know million dollar three million dollar bills. "
"7683420","7684060"," Like they're candy."
"7690860","7694940"," It's a wasteland right now with their small army of people still building."
"7695200","7695460"," Yeah. "
"7696220","7698120"," I was the early adopter of Bitcoin."
"7699240","7699980"," So I've been through."
"7700640","7701540"," I don't know. "
"7701600","7702900"," I don't trade crypto anymore."
"7702960","7704880"," It's been maybe a decade."
"7708520","7713560"," But I've been through like destructive crypto markets. "
"7714360","7714720"," They're horrible."
"7716020","7719460"," They're absolutely they're absolutely horrible when they happen."
"7720640","7725480"," I do find it fascinating how white people blame crypto markets blowing up. "
"7726600","7728740"," I guess I'm getting them becoming an old fuck."
"7728860","7729100"," I'm like."
"7732360","7733980"," I think I've seen this shit before. "
"7738210","7741030"," The only thing I would say about the crypto market is."
"7743330","7746530"," The Wild West is probably coming to an end."
"7747350","7751350"," At 12 a.m. Eastern time we get the STEO report. "
"7752210","7753050"," It's probably."
"7756250","7759950"," It's like the hunt brothers silver stuff like a corner of the market and then this."
"7760350","7762890"," Governments are like fuck no you're not controlling currency. "
"7763390","7767790"," It's one of the things that it's one of the major things that countries go to war over."
"7767870","7770050"," 12 p.m. Eastern time we get this CEO report."
"7772810","7775170"," Pivot upward rejection from our sea low edge. "
"7775170","7776690"," Now pairing an oil."
"7779630","7780350"," Catherine Robert."
"7780530","7780770"," How are you?"
"7782690","7784050"," Inflation will just keep going up. "

"8190670","8191969"," That's horrible to say, but it's true. "
"8192750","8193570"," That's the reality."
"8201900","8203959"," So you're not far from 16 either."

"8222280","8223660"," Say things to our kids where you're like."
"8226139","8228020"," You don't have to say certain things to your kids."
"8228139","8229459"," Like there's like age appropriateness. "
"8229860","8234040"," It's better to explain to it or it's better for a child to know why you shouldn't waste your money"
"8234040","8235879"," on certain things than say."
"8236700","8237700"," Not fucking pissing away."
"8237700","8241059"," There's ways you can talk to your children about these things. "
"8245809","8251090"," So we have these back conversations and of course my wife's like, what, we don't have the money to"
"8251090","8251730"," do this and I'm like."
"8252969","8255870"," No, there's like things down the road for her."
"8257969","8264650"," That are more valuable than her that state's telling you know that they don't want her on the road. "
"8267690","8270129"," And you know, it's like she's got an iPhone."
"8270270","8271150"," She's got an iPad."

"8295650","8299469"," Girls like they have so many are so societal peer pressures on them."
"8300270","8301570"," I didn't see a girl. "
"8301570","8305290"," I didn't care if they were smart, beautiful or considered beautiful."
"8305910","8306709"," Cool kids."
"8307730","8308730"," You name it, right?"
"8308950","8309270"," They can be anything. "
"8309770","8314770"," There was always like always getting wrecked and slammed and I'm like, she's going to forget this"
"8314770","8315809"," entire time in her life."
"8317450","8324950"," Once she goes to college and she's off and doing her own thing, like, she has so much other shit"
"8324950","8332280"," she has to worry about then keeping up with the other Jones's kids."
"8333080","8334760"," Those things mean nothing when you become an adult, right?"
"8335080","8337639"," You become an adult and you're off and doing your own thing. "
"8339840","8342260"," Well, Marnerings were up T.G. down."

"8380200","8384420"," This is definitely trying to turn a support level into a resistance level."
"8388460","8390380"," The comment on Boston being beautiful."
"8390380","8393560"," It was interesting because my father years later told me that. "
"8395100","8398060"," He should have saved done anything that he could to save."
"8401160","8402660"," To save his houses."
"8403660","8406100"," And that's partially the reason not partially. "
"8406360","8410480"," That's pretty fair reason why I had this like panic attack where."
"8411560","8412780"," I'm not paying mortgages anymore."

"8422680","8424800"," Losing that stuff because years later. "
"8425660","8429660"," Those houses, he ended up selling these houses for like in the 1980s or something."
"8429920","8432240"," He was selling them for like three, four, five hundred thousand dollars."
"8433040","8434240"," And they're now worth. "
"8436280","8440480"," We've gone back here and there and looked and they're like, you know, three, four, five million"
"8440480","8441040"," dollar homes."
"8441860","8442600"," Just stupid."
"8445320","8446740"," And there my parents still alive. "
"8448420","8452000"," My wife's father had something similar, but more fucked up."
"8452880","8455320"," He had like, you know, your fucked up story."
"8456320","8458440"," In that same time period, my wife's father. "
"8460440","8464680"," Had homes in California and he worked for the government."
"8465940","8468660"," And so he lived all over the world and stuff."
"8468880","8478620"," He had real property managers, real to property managers that were telling them that is how"
"8478620","8479620"," houses weren't renting. "
"8481000","8485120"," And this one lady specifically, what she was doing was telling them they weren't renting and she"
"8485120","8485920"," was renting them out."
"8487580","8490380"," And then taking the money and like blowing a bunch of drugs and stuff."
"8492060","8493780"," And so they finally figured it out. "
"8494600","8496060"," They had to go back to California."
"8496400","8498460"," I think they went to California to check on the houses."
"8498740","8508520"," I'm people living in them. "

"10801150","10805550"," see this break you're looking for signs of a break and we saw it today so if you trigger that"
"10805550","10810630"," sign of a break what do you do if you if you were long equities down here you're not getting"

"10911970","10918490"," now not just technically just uh they're not in charge at this moment so what would you do in that"
"10918490","10924350"," moment if you had bought a bottom you'd start the process of uh selling your equities and waiting"
"10924350","10934070"," for the next opportunity to buy if that makes sense and"

"11240590","11245290"," market breath on a larger time frame will give you all you need to know of when to be bullish"
"11245290","11249770"," and bearish and then when to be cautious uh so if you're so as we're coming to the top here"
"11249770","11255030"," uh i was bullish coming to the top here absolutely we we hadn't been proved differently i'm getting"
"11255030","11259530"," bearish now so on this smaller i'm not a small or a large time frame like one to three months"
"11259530","11265470"," um i'm bearish at this point absolutely bulls would have to do a ton of work for me not to"
"11265470","11271810"," be bearish uh so now there's this big chunk that even this even this trade today this isn't that"
"11271810","11278930"," this we're not down that much there's a giant move down coming giant and it's probably going to"

"11402020","11407900"," 2020 if you had taken a trade it was small caps um some inferences we can make though in here"
"11407900","11417180"," right so uh in recent history at least in recent history we know that some buyers were here if"
"11417180","11425690"," there was some there was some demand down here right slam down they took it back up"
"11425690","11436380"," somewhere right there somewhere down in here we know that there's some demand push"

"11439700","11446580"," up you know there's some real push down here that price targets one thirty one thirty nine seventy"
"11446580","11452320"," seven so on a baseline if the market were to crash at any point if iWM was going to crash"
"11452320","11460280"," at any point you'd expect some kind of a bottom down here could demand come in higher than this"
"11460280","11471510"," sure you could put a uh i"
"11471510","11481010"," was like big time frames i always like big round numbers so 150 this is this is august of 2028"
"11481010","11491400"," we'll move this into where's 2024 at january march somewhere in here we'll"
"11491400","11504360"," probably see that over time not guaranteed but probably you also have this this demand here and"
"11504360","11509920"," you can see it right here too push up push up push up right you see that demand demand the"
"11509920","11524250"," gap to be filled in here do you see that amen like this yellow there's"
"11524250","11534210"," a giant air gap though in here it's right yeah right there so if you see see my cursor"

"11550870","11562680"," there that's a gap uh"
"11562680","11566960"," now buyers did come up in here right saw that they came out from the gap and pushed it up"
"11567520","11579690"," pushed it up pushed it up they didn't want it they didn't want this big giant air gap it's"
"11579690","11591130"," a come down a smaller time frame it's a little bit better here right you're"
"11591130","11596890"," more than likely going to see an attempt to close the gap down below here is the gap right here"
"11599190","11606210"," there's a real gap down here you've seen demand come up twice once pushed it up twice pushed it up"
"11606210","11613270"," uh we came above right sellers we've found out that sellers were above here and said fuck you know"
"11613270","11620450"," we're not going higher seller stepped right in and said nope"

"11636560","11657250"," let's see what i can i don't"
"11659650","11669630"," know where that is a favorable i'm probably going to think this is all not worth but"
"11669630","11691750"," this is probably going to probably going to say that that's not valid any longer the"
"11694790","11710440"," second here might decide to change this later but somewhere in there yes"
"11710440","11716800"," just based on this it wouldn't that make a fucking regardless we keep coming up here wouldn't it be"

"11721440","11729000"," think it's going to be something more like this it's january march could do this kind of a thing"
"11729000","11736540"," then you get that dip down here and that's up i think time doesn't really matter i think this area"
"11736540","11746380"," right here um i changed the and that might be a better it's more like this more like a gap"
"11746380","11754000"," down here but not real this isn't real right here this is just demand pushing up but there's"
"11754000","11761260"," fucking nothing holding this here i guess this shit yeah it's nothing but this being created uh you"
"11761260","11766920"," might not get this down here as long as this demand stays here uh they got a rug pull it"
"11766920","11771640"," i'd say that he'd waiting for a rug pull on i-w-m i would expect i'd um i'd even"

"12134890","12140490"," said fuck that we ain't doing that but yesterday it looked like a hit and run and uh in the"
"12140490","12143530"," clothes i was like maybe we'll do a hit and run they'll sell it overnight and then rip it back"
"12143530","12147690"," up but you could tell right off the bell we didn't even get to the pivot point they just said"
"12147690","12154970"," fuck it we're starting to sell just sold it right down here it's bloodbath in it uh and s3 down"

"12178550","12182830"," now you're seeing real money selling bulls bought that bottom down below they needed to see that"
"12182830","12187910"," trigger to sell the market with real money selling and you saw that trigger today today was the day"
"12187910","12196530"," where and this is even leading up to today you know like it's so let's look um had you taken"
"12196530","12203230"," the stand because people wanted to take the stance um there was you guys got to understand man like"
"12203230","12210530"," when we were down here there was an expectation there was an expectation that we were going like"
"12210530","12219710"," down here well you guys can't see that hold on you guys have your memories are not you guys"
"12219710","12228170"," specifically but social media's memories are very short uh social media's memories are uh extremely"
"12228170","12239710"," short it's uh go to a year tart so social media's memories are um crazy"
"12239710","12248710"," short uh hold on here you guys memories are like oftentimes social media's memories are like a day"
"12248710","12257270"," you guys forget you guys actually you guys fucking forget we can even go here it doesn't matter we"
"12257270","12262790"," can go here we can go there we'll give it to the bears we'll say we weren't expected that much"
"12262790","12269070"," cap but you were expecting something like this two months ago i know you were i was there i"
"12269070","12277710"," remember i was there that morning and uh let's talk about this zone right here right so bears got"
"12277710","12283970"," fucked here straight up got fucked i know they did and there was and i know that there was"
"12283970","12290470"," screaming and yelling that we're going here and so you have to like play that trade right and you"
"12290470","12294630"," get that first bounce down here and you're starting to get some confirmation here in real"
"12294630","12298790"," confirmation here so and what what does that mean right so even if you were bearish down here what"
"12298790","12304290"," it means though is this is the key thing to remember right there were like two things going on here"
"12304290","12311310"," uh you get some confirmation that we're going up so bulls are in down here bulls are fine right now"
"12311310","12316190"," that what that's why you're seeing they want to see confirmation that this is an actual topic got"
"12316190","12320790"," the broke break today you didn't see any real money selling until today the reason you're seeing it"
"12320790","12324970"," today is because they're meeting these these expectations just like down here this botting process"
"12324970","12329110"," at some point is a bull or is a bear you had to say okay they're proving that we're going"
"12329110","12333210"," up right it's my point so when you're down here like okay they're fucking proving it we're not"
"12333210","12338810"," actually going down here they're making uh they're making gains to make a make a move higher this"
"12338810","12344150"," is the meat of the trade right here and the same thing is right here was as you're making this"
"12344150","12348870"," topping process we don't know if we're going to continue higher you're trading the levels in here"
"12348870","12353990"," you're trading the levels in here and now this now that it's showing itself you're seeing the real"
"12353990","12359310"," equity selling so they're they're pointing lower to a move lower how will that move it move is we"
"12359310","12363330"," don't know we have to look at the um market breadth and we got to look at ppo all kinds"
"12363330","12368310"," of other fucking shit to see how deep this actually goes but there's a meat of this trade that's"
"12368310","12373050"," starting right now there's this beautiful meat of the trade that you can take as a bear same thing"
"12373050","12378770"," on the way up there's a meat of the trade on the way up um but let's let's not let's"
"12378770","12383390"," this is the real reason for the topic of conversation and the real reason for that topic of"
"12383390","12389610"," conversation is uh like i've got to ask them stream just now you know why wouldn't you have just"
"12389610","12395150"," shorted here you knew this was here uh you would have just shorted i did short some or not short"
"12395150","12399270"," but i had puts in some of these ads and puts here and here and i put on a di"
"12399270","12405910"," or a um di a triple leverage short for springtime because even if we went up i didn't believe"
"12405910","12410570"," fucking i don't believe i didn't believe Dow Jones at all uh but the reason i say that is because"
"12410570","12417150"," i heard the same shit with this seller i heard the same shit with this seller i heard the same"
"12417150","12423450"," shit with this seller i heard the same shit with that seller i heard the same shit with that seller"
"12426050","12434710"," so you you really want to like trend is up every time you do this you get this sell off"
"12434710","12439670"," and you're like okay i'm trading that level right i sold this down and now you're looking for that"
"12439670","12446050"," moment for bears to get productive and the moment that you see this today right this is where we"
"12446050","12453270"," got production today if you were a bull in here this triggers you to say oh fuck that i'm fucking"
"12453270","12459210"," long spy and fuck an equity call or equity uh share position i'm fucking holding Tesla i'm fucking"
"12459210","12464770"," holding apple i'm holding fucking from from way down here let's say this is your trigger to sell"
"12464770","12471570"," and so you're seeing that uh in today and today you're seeing today that the options market doesn't"
"12471570","12477830"," match where we're going you're seeing that this is called this is what's called real equity selling"
"12477830","12484070"," in the market and so that was the trigger uh you should trade like that that's how the market"
"12484070","12490590"," trades and uh you're seeing it uh in real time right now this afternoon uh real equity selling"
"12491070","12500890"," trading down at a 390 353 we'll look at a five-day chart here and see that track okay so"
"12500890","12507130"," yes remember yesterday in yesterday's stream we said the bears really want to remember we when we"
"12507130","12513410"," had had this channel here we were talking about this channel we said it kind of came down here got"
"12513410","12518430"," bought back up right came back down in here yesterday and we were like heck and they do it in"

"12522170","12528390"," not in a liquid market right uh so what what a bears want for the end of the at least"
"12528390","12534730"," end of today is they want to get down here you can see this over here right some demand set"
"12534730","12538990"," in they're looking to fucking get this man i don't think they're gonna get it we'll move this up a"

"12577790","12584330"," selling selling uh if you wanted the reason this morning we first started this morning we asked the"
"12584330","12591210"," question uh have you seen the reasons to turn bearish and uh we went through the arguments the"
"12591210","12601590"," bulls had left if you weren't sold on that now you should be see if"
"12601590","12610010"," i can you're going to look for the next place for bulls to try to make it stand gonna be"

"12635480","12640000"," this level matter of fact as we get down here there could be a um there could be a plunge"
"12640000","12647060"," here get a nice little plunge here so you can draw this in here that would be the target limit"
"12647060","12656360"," hold on here so there is uh nothing but an air gap down below at"

"15478070","15487930"," energies energy is probably a buy or close to a buy they clipped it i mean it's down i could"
"15487930","15493870"," get held down you could see energy get held down for uh depending on how long this rotation out of"
"15493870","15500170"," of sectors is you could wait until all the sectors have been rotated out of but i would keep your"
"15500170","15505430"," eye on energy turning at some point it'd be worth it'd be worth watching energy during the rotation"
"15505430","15516070"," uh so"
"15516070","15521910"," Emerson so if any guys don't know Emerson he's a great trader he's making some comments and stream"
"15521910","15526590"," their outstanding he's saying for a weekly expected move we are in a bloodbath territory yeah for"
"15526590","15532030"," the weekly expected move i think we're two deviations right i think we are at this point it's"
"15532030","15536250"," anywhere down in here is the second deviation for the week right we've sold we've given back the"
"15536250","15544050"," entire week no there's some bulls in here that had 395 as a point of no return for them 393"

"15553970","15563090"," um i wanted to see the sell off this week myself i didn't think it would be this deep but"
"15563090","15567690"," there's symbols saying that it's good that we're selling off into um fmc they want to buy this kind"
"15567690","15575210"," of a dip and we're not seeing full rotations today right which is kind of weird usually you kind of"
"15575210","15578810"," see a little bit off everything right everything is kind of down there they're like sector specific"
"15578810","15588660"," today uh for weekly expected move we're in bloodbath territory long-term this is silly"
"15588660","15593000"," selling nothing serious and that's the last part of what Emerson's saying is that this is nothing"
"15593000","15597980"," serious yeah it's glaring in spy but it's not glaring across the market i agree with that looking"
"15597980","15604380"," around the market in sectors i'm like oh wow i'm like spy's taking a hit but it's not in it's"
"15604380","15613260"," not in duck it's not in it's not um you can't correlate it to uh other other sectors within the"
"15613260","15618720"," spy i agree with that i'm seeing that now looking around the market i'm like him if i can sold"
"15618720","15625560"," shit in this market yet we've got some real money selling going on they're selling the spy we"
"15625560","15634860"," watched it today that they were selling spy we see what uh Emerson's saying in there"

"15658650","15664010"," yeah man on the time frame that you're looking at so when you guys here when we talk about"
"15664010","15670110"," bullishness and bearishness completely different time frames we were talking different time frames"
"15670110","15675570"," here we were we were talking about what wilson was saying that you know like wilson's probably"
"15675570","15680190"," saying we're selling the equity market he's not you can see he's he hasn't sold some of the equity"
"15680190","15688870"," market he's like we're sellers here uh he could be selling this just to get a nice fucking fat dip"
"15688870","15694790"," to buy for he might know what's going to be said at the uh fmc mean right you get an"
"15694790","15701590"," initial bullish response in the equity market you want to sell into that strength on a high of four"

"15709230","15714870"," you know as of today for me i hit some i technical levels to say the bears have done what"
"15714870","15719750"," they needed to do to start to roll the market over so i'm going to bullish stance at this point"
"15719750","15725630"," our bearish stance at this point i'm still listening to the to the uh bulls though i'm open to i'm"
"15725630","15730150"," open to the fucking you know if i'm bullish i'm open to the bears if i'm bearish i'm open to"

"16672869","16678950"," you to right now you can copy and paste the levels every day on a captain's alpha right uh so"
"16678950","16688450"," i have my daughter and i are working on getting you gamma levels in a chart form and then"
"16688450","16694770"," getting uh them plotted for you every day you should be able to plug them into whatever your your"
"16694770","16700550"," charting software is on a daily basis so if you're using a trading view you can just plug in the"
"16700550","16706250"," numbers like cut and paste uh but if you're saying that i should do like a trading view where you"

"16710270","16717050"," front of you uh so this algorithm you'll have access to uh on trading view at some point in the"
"16717050","16722990"," next i'm assuming the next couple weeks uh and what you'll be able to do is just go in and"
"16722990","16727810"," run it on that whatever your favorite ticker is and we'll we'll run it on we'll have a list of"
"16727810","16733150"," tickers as well uh and then the other the last part of this i guess so you get the gamma"
"16733150","16739410"," levels you get the you'll get the the charting every day and you'll what we'll end up doing doing"
"16739410","16744669"," is we'll do this charting every day and we'll leave this up for you to have access to maybe without"

"18179410","18191250"," this is a volume bar of significance kind of not really nope it's"
"18191250","18200810"," a 15 minute chart 2.5 million that's pretty good 1.68 million 2.2 million 2.25"
"18200810","18211060"," million get a nice uh nice wick on this candle though still"
"18211060","18216540"," a nice wick right now we'll see this is still developing this candle so it'll it'll it'll change"
"18216540","18226430"," over time we want to see"

"18242290","18254130"," on we where else do you get play by play the"
"18254130","18261430"," same thing down here you want to take a walk around the market and see if the the odds are"
"18261430","18272260"," against or in our favor this is stronger over here than it was over here book"
"18272260","18277500"," map showing some strength in this in this move right here that could be a turnaround remember we"
"18277500","18283560"," were always though we're selling the rip you want to see if this gets the if it reacts off 100"
"18283560","18290960"," here we could just take off uh well we're gonna be looking for targets above from here but could"
"18290960","18295280"," have just could just just left the 100 on the one-minute chart and trade it off at all day"
"18295280","18305210"," if you um want to here view up way far above right view up's probably coming"
"18305210","18314000"," down to where this red bar is right here if you're looking to take this trade you'd be wanting to"
"18314000","18322060"," see you want to see a break above this 100 the 100 is very very reactive uh that would be"
"18322060","18328980"," the trade there possible you can get up here to 395 for if you want to bullish trade here but"
"18328980","18337580"," I don't trust this at all but we're in a trend down day today so looking for a reversal off"
"18339280","18344760"," and down into the bell still it would only be fitting that you'd get the you know it would only"
"18344760","18352860"," be fitting that you get that into the bell right down there s3 i'm not input on this on this"
"18352860","18358380"," yet i want to see it come up and reject i want to see how almost to touch and some"
"18358380","18373530"," stupid like that uh"
"18373530","18377890"," if you're like this is too much to take this next leg down uh all you have to be looking"
"18377890","18383410"," for is a volume bar it's pretty easy let's go to like a um five-minute chart you go to"
"18383410","18387490"," this is a five-minute chart right here you know five-minute chart you go to 15 you want to"
"18387490","18396070"," see reversal bar you'll know it you'll know a reversal bar when you see it pretty easy that's only"
"18396070","18403490"," 2.6 million it's pretty it's stronger i got a 15-minute you want to see like 15 million something"
"18403490","18413360"," like that buyers still lower than sellers right now this is just short covering it's all it"
"18413360","18423270"," is it's all it is you can't it develop into more yes but you"
"18423270","18428030"," want to see this first like first you want confirmation you want to see something like this break"
"18428030","18436090"," above you want to see a 15-minute candle develop into millions just quick pullback and you'll take"
"18436090","18446070"," that rip you can also watch the premium on calls that'll sometimes give you a hint as well"
"18448050","18453270"," if you watch the call side let's say let's say so let's say right now you're like uh i want"
"18453270","18461070"," to take calls here captain i think we're reversing into the bell we were talked about this with you"
"18461070","18466230"," earlier i'm not when earlier up here i was like oh i'm not seeing it was like a small rips"
"18466230","18472090"," up here and you weren't you would just i was watching calls go like 21 cents 23 cents if we"
"18472090","18478430"," were ripping higher you'd see like 21 cent calls go to like 35 cents 40 cents just right here i"
"18478430","18483670"," mean you get people following you buying those calls so if you want just watching the options chain"
"18483670","18493610"," i let me go look at call side hold on it's where are you right now 391s"
"18493610","18502090"," so just look at like um just look at 393s right here they're 41 cents right now okay you want"
"18502090","18507850"," to see like a ramp in the price of those calls they're 40 cents right now they're at 41 a"
"18507850","18514050"," second to go you want to take a ramp in the in before it actually moves you'll start you'll start"
"18514050","18525210"," you'll start chasing it to jump into them you know it'll"
"18525210","18531350"," give you a picture of this it'll it'll give you a lead a lead indicator that this is not rolling"
"18531350","18541270"," anymore so it's like hints for you to be looking for if you're"
"18541270","18548790"," saying too risky too dumb too stupid i don't know why you take this no there's some pretty simple"
"18548790","18554750"," ways to find out if you should have shown or if you're taking a long down here where where can"
"18554750","18564630"," you probably buy make some money if your input you can watch the long side and see if"
"18564630","18571270"," it's gaining attraction and there's some people here in stream that have bought like calls on that"
"18571270","18576290"," are way outside the money and you'll watch you can watch the ramp even when the market's going down"
"18577370","18580770"," there are other ways to do this too you could look at a you could look at a farther out"
"18580770","18588550"," date just a week or two and you'll see a ramp even though it might be moving not moving on"
"18588550","18593970"," the zero dates or one day so you'll see like five dates start moving up we're holding price and"
"18593970","18601270"," that's going to infer a market directional change i wish there was a program for that"
"18601270","18611810"," i should"
"18611810","18620610"," ask that week two weeks out relative to zero dates and if there's diversions in the direction of"
"18620610","18625450"," the market's going a certain way i might tell you if there's a market or directional shift take"
"18625450","18635870"," place we'll check the five minute again it's pretty"
"18635870","18645870"," good right there 800 700 000 200 000 pretty good 15 minutes not quite"
"18645870","18656230"," showing it yet still sellers here big"
"18656230","18663150"," buyers stepping in right now volume buyers getting in there this is good to see right here get a"
"18663150","18671940"," nice rip you could take this for a short rip see what the call side costs those are that calls"
"18671940","18676900"," are now 49 cents they were 40 cents we're getting the set we're getting some premium kick on 393s"
"18676900","18708920"," i'm going to enter that trade real quick and"
"18708920","18715860"," there wasn't a lot of distribution they haven't clipped utilities yet i thought they would have"
"18715860","18758720"," clipped utilities at this point see"
"18758720","18767850"," if this gets rejected or not right here calls it out to 51 cents i'm in 10 a 10 pack"
"18785760","18795660"," now 53 cents giving a breakthrough here the sixth sense 57 cents"
"18795660","18827770"," put a stop out of a 50 cents change"
"18827770","18846070"," my stop I'm at 54 cents nope i'm out let's get kicked out kicked"

"18899080","18905940"," an argument or not there's a there's a stitched together argument that well first of all let's"
"18905940","18914620"," start with uh bulls didn't want to take a trade higher off 410"
"18914620","18922020"," they want to see like consolidation that consolidation turned into distribution on the spy right"
"18924400","18930600"," there was another guy that was like i don't want to i don't want to long into opex if we"
"18930600","18938840"," were trading high into it anyways i'd rather buy a dip into opex there's also a seasonality chart"
"18938840","18946100"," that shows uh December having two separate rips especially one and two in a matter of fact the"
"18946100","18951160"," shirt doesn't line up exactly to the days but there's a second rip and the second half of the month"
"18951160","18959660"," the rip became early this year and the holiday rally so the invocation being to be another rip on"
"18959660","18976780"," opex um i'm flat right now on uh zero dates now uh"
"18976780","18981480"," you know you had mike barry come out and say he was he was fucking short you know he was"
"18981480","18987160"," short market fucking blew up in his face right so then mike wilson came out and fucking set uh"
"18987160","18994000"," Morgan Stanley came out with said we're selling equities uh i think i do think that i think guys"
"18994000","18997760"," like that do that shit to each other i think they're fucking funny or whatever or then they go to"
"18997760","19000920"," like a holiday party and they're fucking like yeah you know i've fucking came out there until miles"
"19000920","19006400"," long equities or mike wilson said he was long equities and then of course monday morning when we're"
"19006400","19011600"," about to break through mike wilson came out publicly and said i'm fucking short and i get fucking"
"19011600","19019580"," burry out there we're fucking retarded sorry since that word so anyway there's still an argument"
"19019580","19026440"," that you could say you could say that uh wilson is kind of manipulating the market milson's like"
"19026440","19032360"," i'm selling the market could just be him wanting a better put he said specifically in his statement"
"19032360","19041340"," he said there's not enough to make on the upside there's a key words that i saw those key he"
"19041340","19048080"," says not enough upside to go to 430 or i think he called 430 440 if we rock uh you"
"19048080","19054900"," can correct me on that there's a gap at 420 so if he gets it down far enough maybe there"
"19054900","19063280"," is a reason to then take a trip up there right uh three four five hundred point uh ripper he"
"19063280","19072660"," might also know that news will be interpreted by the stock market uh could be an initial pump on"
"19072660","19079960"," the market so let's say we trade it up right now to 430 or 420 and 430 into opex let's"
"19079960","19087040"," say mike let's say um Morgan Stanley's approach is we're going to sell into strength and so they're"

"19102160","19108920"," we're gonna blast it up to fucking 460 470 that could be taken as a market reversal and they may"
"19108920","19114880"," not want to be selling into that kind of strength it might trigger other market participants to"
"19114880","19120720"," fuck their trade up to sell into that strength so there could be like some kind of a man this"

"20001050","20005870"," to be like what would like uh you'd have to write this you'd have to write an equation to be"
"20005870","20014230"," like what's like the cumulative effect of putting this against this uh yields like uh"
"20014230","20020630"," or like yields isn't a good example unemployment's actually a good example it's a very simple way"
"20020630","20028390"," to uh it's expectation of the impact of the market as as unemployment changes um maybe you can add"
"20028390","20034410"," volatility to and you guys ever look back you can see some of the uh fmc meetings or like uh"
"20034410","20039370"," you buy into them then you sell the minutes there's some like consistent patterns that some of them"
"20039370","20046130"," are like better than others so like the more consistent patterns you can add in uh there's like"

"20072070","20078430"," of a market you can add that in like all this shit you can add into this stuff and then"
"20078430","20082470"," you have to run it and see if there's problems is it is it fucking it up is it helping"
"20082470","20090050"," it is it helping it to make a turn when you need to make a turn uh you got cycles"
"20090050","20096770"," you've got sector cycles there's all this shit you can add into it so cyclical rotations by the"
"20096770","20109040"," year by decades yeah"
