"6420","13140"," I want to thank Bob for coming on the set and Phil for visiting us because I've been negative in"
"13140","16980"," the stock as you know, but that's, I've changed that stance."
"17360","20420"," It's just too of an opportunity to make a place that we appreciate it. "
"20720","21540"," Thank you all for the time."
"21780","22140"," Thank you Jim."
"23300","26900"," When we come back I'll get Kramer's mad dash, count down to the opening bell, take a look at"
"26900","33120"," futures here holding in 10 years, still sub four and the 30 year, just about 11 basis points away. "
"33280","33680"," Don't go away."
"172860","181790"," The futures remain green, so many interesting numbers this morning, 10 year 396, VIX is right at"
"181790","188070"," 12, the dollar index almost back to 102, and of course the all time closing high on the S&P"
"188070","192030"," 4796 would be just about 90 points away."
"192530","193850"," We'll get the opening bell in four minutes. "
"193850","382490"," Let's get"
"382490","383250"," to a mad dash."
"384030","385430"," You have a very little amount of time."
"385550","386930"," We got an opening bell in 45 seconds. "
"386950","387270"," Okay all right, all right."
"387410","391610"," Look Raj, you're a comedian, it's not getting the recognition you should, if that acts."
"392210","396170"," Burnsy today just talks about, can Fedex continue to put points on the board and again, working?"
"396350","396890"," Yes they can. "
"397310","401810"," This is about a transformation Fedex and I think that this stock is as high as it is."
"401890","404230"," It goes higher because Raj is doing a killer job."
"404650","405450"," It's just crushing it. "
"405690","406790"," Raj is going up?"
"406850","407070"," Yes."
"407850","411730"," And Raj, the Fred Smith bill, the fake company, the time for new blood."
"412250","415250"," Raj is taking it into overdrive, this baseball drive. "
"415790","418630"," I like the stock for the very, very much."
"420690","423350"," Let's get the opening bell and see if he'll kind of change."
"423690","429770"," The big boy that is here there, celebrating the sponsorship of Brian Harsh, one of the best places"
"429770","432090"," in New York City and the Windsor Village there. "
"432370","436510"," I've been asked to act out and go and act for business and land management company."
"437170","439930"," Jim has worked a 47-23 today."
"440170","441250"," Yeah look at it. "
"441990","443650"," I think that there's a big pivot."
"443850","445950"," You got to watch Max 7 versus everything else."
"446550","452010"," Watch a science bank, but watch a bank like Comerico, which everybody's really worried about. "
"452130","454210"," Watch Swab, which at one time people are worried about."
"454490","456450"," Those are the ones that I think can really have it move."
"457030","460190"," And then even though they're big, the home builders will do better. "
"461010","463670"," But I just think that this is also a Home Depot market."
"464490","468810"," Like if you start feeling better, you're going to remodel and renovate."
"469010","471550"," And a lot of people were not remodeling and renovating. "
"471810","474570"," That stock may be another stock that you want to be."
"474670","475910"," What did land go on say yesterday?"
"476130","483570"," Of course he's one of the old founders of the returns on that company's stock since inception are,"
"483910","486130"," since the one public are amazing."
"486610","487750"," Well you know, look, you really are amazing. "
"490050","495470"," And if you think the shrink has peaked, they have a terrible shrink problem."
"495650","499710"," You know what we have to do is look at their private label brands that are for sale right now"
"499710","500230"," on Amazon."
"501070","503010"," Yeah, they don't sell on Amazon. "
"505810","507850"," Oh, so people are stealing them."
"508030","509550"," And then they have website, right?"
"510010","512970"," You know, it's not a really good thing."
"514309","515270"," No, it's a bad thing. "
"515450","515630"," Yeah."
"515909","516890"," But you get some great deals."
"517730","519350"," And I think everyone belongs to Jeff. "
"520150","523950"," Yeah, we got to figure out something."
"524790","525910"," Yeah, we have an extension."
"525910","526310"," Look at the return. "
"526670","527030"," There it is."
"527250","527890"," Thank you guys."
"528070","529630"," Look at when you look at that, look at that. "
"530770","531550"," And it's fine."
"531550","533050"," And the stores are almost packed."
"533430","536350"," Wait, that's almost a million percent in return. "
"537370","543250"," The stores are jammed like my wife said more than she's ever seen to be purchased."
"543590","545150"," That is 42 years."
"545430","549150"," But well, David, it's a fantastic place to shop. "
"549990","551970"," Jim, that's wealth creation."
"552450","553070"," Yes, it's wealthy."
"554310","555530"," This is discovering Home Depot. "
"556290","556970"," It's way to go."
"557090","562050"," You know, I think, come on, did you know it was a million percent a million a million percent?"
"562290","562410"," No."
"562530","564650"," No, I do know that this is what the market does. "
"565050","569590"," But maybe we should just sit here and talk about wealth distribution and the rich and the poor and"
"569590","575650"," Congress and how we look at the two year and the tenure and forget that million percent, David,"
"575690","577850"," because that's only available for people who do other homework."
"578090","582130"," You could have come on the mad dash of 1981 and said, Hey, put away Home Depot and then you"
"582130","583270"," wouldn't remember how to say anything again."
"583490","588550"," You could just shut up for the money. "
"588550","590090"," I love this company, Home Depot."
"590550","595810"," My wife is sending me pictures two days ago from Home Depot and just this sheer number of people."
"596310","596670"," Incredible. "
"597270","602170"," Jim, your point about the regionals is a good one because Schwab, citizens, true as Key, region,"
"602530","605350"," Zion's all helping to lead the market here up four more."
"605570","606570"," That's a percentage gain."
"606830","607430"," That's what you want. "
"607530","609190"," We pay for a percentage gains."
"609410","613970"," We don't want four more points than Microsoft."
"614510","619110"," We want to get to 5% in region's financial, which we thought was left for dead. "
"619570","621650"," 8 times earnings, 5% yield."
"622150","623510"," I now feel much better about the yield."
"623790","625130"," And that's what you're looking for. "
"625930","627670"," And now people say, well, where's region's financial?"
"628090","630010"," Well, you know, it's in the South."
"630370","631110"," Nothing out of that."
"632150","635970"," Adobe, you had, you had shot new on that money last night. "
"636450","641110"," Adobe stock is down over 6% after reporting earnings after the bell yesterday."
"641870","646110"," It seems to be despite what was a strong fourth quarter, Jim, that they did lower their fiscal year"
"646110","648010"," 24 expectations in terms of guidance."
"648050","649350"," Not the first time he's done that. "
"649590","649990"," No."
"650950","651730"," What do you think?"
"652290","657730"," I think you wait for another day, maybe tomorrow, but then you buy it because even though he"
"657730","660610"," lowered guidance, every division is on fire."
"661150","662130"," And he's done this before. "
"662490","664710"," He usually waited a day or two and you get back in."
"664750","668450"," Now, of course, in a fed rate cut, it may not be the ideal stock to buy."
"669270","671790"," But David, I'm going to go back to your world. "
"672490","672890"," Okay."
"673690","676690"," This thing, Adobe shares, it's very important for them."
"677090","677670"," Still right. "
"677850","678650"," They're still waiting on approval."
"678970","682830"," And I think the private company, by the way, private company, but I think they paid a huge number"
"682830","683610"," for 20 bill."
"684210","686950"," But I think the just department doesn't want it to happen. "
"687410","691650"," And Johnson and I were batting back and forth that there are now so many new companies in the area"
"691650","694690"," that since the just part of that angry, this is very typical."
"695130","698510"," Like when just one went after Google, that was before TikTok."
"699450","700890"," I mean, TikTok is killing Google. "
"701570","703050"," So I mean, why should we worry about Google?"
"703950","705010"," TikTok is killing everybody."
"705410","711050"," Well, that is the old criticism of antitrust policy in general can never keep up with the dynamism"
"711050","711550"," of the market."
"712710","713610"," Wow, it's good. "
"714010","714570"," Thank you."
"715670","720170"," Every so often, he's so good dynamism of the market."
"720730","720930"," Wow. "
"721750","727590"," Look, this is just one of those moments where you look at what's worse, decide if that's a good"
"727590","728190"," balance sheet."
"728990","736310"," And if that's a good balance sheet, you can get in, which is which brings me to foot locker, foot"
"736310","737130"," locker upgraded."
"737670","738810"," Okay, it does hyper. "
"739210","740670"," It does not have a good balance sheet."
"740810","741890"," My trust owns it."
"742130","747590"," It's been disappointing, but not anymore because they're talking about full price merchandise. "
"748110","751130"," What's been deviled them is discounting."
"751610","755730"," They had $1 billion in inventory that wasn't going to close in a 70 chance."
"756270","757190"," This is Mary Dylan. "
"757470","759210"," It's never paid the bet against Mary Dylan."
"759470","761010"," She turned around Ulta."
"761270","767430"," She's going to do it again with foot locker, even as everybody feels that she doesn't have the"
"767430","767690"," horses. "
"768270","768810"," She's got Nike."
"769090","771890"," She's got your new balance is doing incredibly well."
"772090","773170"," People don't talk about new balance. "
"773730","775110"," Don't forget, Hulk is doing well."
"775790","779430"," We're going to get, we've got foot locker upgrade, Piper goes to overweight."
"779610","780390"," We'll get Costco tonight. "
"780870","784570"," Costco is going to be one where I think we're going to say, well, you know, that's that's an A"
"784570","784890"," student."
"785330","787790"," I'm looking for a C student that's going to be common A student."
"788350","789430"," I don't need an A student. "
"789610","790290"," It's been the best time."
"790290","791390"," That was an all time high yesterday."
"791610","799870"," And again, today, I think maybe Etsy, these layoffs burn steam today calls it the new eBay and a"
"799870","800330"," good short. "
"800710","802390"," That's so aggressive."
"802670","803690"," I think that's wrong."
"803930","806250"," I think that Josh, someone was overstaffed. "
"806770","812450"," I think that there's a lot to like, but it was one of those companies that are like Ohana, like"
"812450","816330"," Salesforce had with the Ohana before LA got involved."
"816790","818590"," It's not as interested in the Ohana."
"818970","820990"," We're Hawaiian family. "
"821510","823750"," Hawaiian word for family is Ohana, right?"
"824070","825970"," And Salesforce had a more Ohana approach."
"826330","827510"," Yeah, but that went out the window."
"827750","831710"," And then when they got a bunch of activists, they started to focus more on margins and perhaps that"
"831710","835490"," meant actually not hiring as many and even firing some people. "
"836010","836490"," Yes."
"836690","836790"," Yeah."
"837010","837250"," Yes. "
"837430","838890"," They they actually down 10 pounds."
"838890","841790"," So your point is on Etsy what that they were overstaffed?"
"841990","846290"," That's I just think that Etsy could be a remarkable stock again."
"846530","849410"," But obviously they had two big of table employment. "
"849850","850850"," Yeah, right here in Brooklyn."
"851570","852810"," Right here in Brooklyn."
"852810","858210"," Look, I happen to think that obviously they're worried about Christmas and probably not that good. "
"858750","860050"," But I also think it's a franchise."
"860490","861170"," It's a good franchise."
"861370","861550"," You do. "
"861890","862590"," Yeah, I do."
"863410","865910"," Let's talk a little Moderna because that stock is up sharply."
"866350","872470"," It does typically trade in big increments percentage wise on news, sometimes not even on any. "
"872730","878350"," But this morning, the news is potentially a real positive for for people with resective high risk"
"878350","879030"," melanoma."
"879030","884110"," They've been testing their cancer vaccine essentially for lack of a better term with Petruda."
"884510","887670"," Of course, one of the great cancer fighting drugs from Merck. "
"887870","889750"," And they got some decent results, Jim."
"890210","891990"," Yeah, I think I'm so glad you call it the vaccine."
"892170","897710"," Wait, when I when I first interviewed seven bands sell, it was at the J."
"897750","897870"," P."
"898030","900050"," Morgan conference to stop his 11th. "
"900050","903730"," Members stopped when I think and he said, we're going to develop vaccines for cancer."
"903970","905550"," And I should not believe when I see it."
"905610","905870"," I know. "
"906130","906550"," And then he did."
"906870","907330"," And then he did."
"907910","911690"," Stefan Ben saw was a guest on squat box this morning talking about this latest trial. "
"912350","914410"," As you can see, sort of the headlines on it right there."
"914590","915630"," Take a listen to what he thought."
"917510","924010"," Now, at a three year mark in the same study, we shrink almost 50%, meaning the two curves are"
"924010","926330"," differentiating further as time goes by. "
"926710","932890"," And that's really exciting because not only we think to have a huge impact on melanoma, it's one in"
"932890","933450"," two people."
"933930","938450"," Think about the number of lives that can be impacted and both people can be saved and live a normal"
"938450","941050"," life, despite the diagnostic of cancer."
"942930","943730"," Very excited. "
"944150","944170"," Yeah."
"944730","948890"," Now, we know cancers, you know, people think the cancer is all one disease."
"949530","950030"," And it's not. "
"950530","956770"," But I just think that this is something that tells me that the original franchise is finally here."
"957130","960210"," And that's that's something it's worth more than just where the stock is."
"960450","964110"," But David, as great as this one is, the stock that people keep talking about is Vertex. "
"964890","973470"," Because if you do have a pain drug and it does not cause habit forming behavior, then you have to"
"973470","973930"," buy the stock."
"974150","975130"," And it's coming down."
"975390","975690"," So it's an opportunity. "
"976250","977210"," Yeah, it was up yesterday."
"977350","978830"," Of course, we discussed it."
"979290","979530"," Right. "
"979950","982270"," The positive on his face too trial, I believe."
"982650","987190"," Yeah, but that's the they they publicized that which was meaning their confidence levels very hard."
"987550","992510"," Conceivably would replace opioids in terms of pain management, which obviously would be a very big"
"992510","992850"," deal. "
"993050","993330"," Yes."
"994390","997430"," We still are in the midst of an absolute crisis in this country."
"997810","999170"," Oh my, it's just far. "
"999310","1000370"," We don't talk about that often."
"1000850","1006250"," Why don't we because you know, it's at the core of a lot of the problems with employment, health"
"1006250","1006590"," care."
"1007270","1008350"," And we don't talk about it. "
"1008490","1009210"," Bring people a day."
"1009530","1016210"," So if you had something you could change, you could change full towns."
"1017650","1024410"," Got a record high on Apple gym, 199 62 city today names at a top pick for 24. "
"1025089","1026150"," They say the bears are missing."
"1026810","1031030"," iPhone, premiumization, silicon, insourcing, acceleration and services."
"1031810","1034910"," They think vision pro and AI is just a upside catalyst. "
"1035089","1041730"," Yeah, look, I I have to tell you, I think that I thought that that report was very good in"
"1041730","1043349"," terms of talking about the service revenue."
"1043550","1044869"," They're using 16%."
"1044869","1046089"," I think they're actually low bowling. "
"1046710","1053690"," But Mike Seaver at T-Mobile, when I interviewed him last week in Seattle, these guys are an amazing"
"1053690","1054050"," partner."
"1054810","1058710"," And it wouldn't be would not surprise me if they partner on some bigger stuff than they're just"
"1058710","1059330"," doing right now."
"1059890","1066850"," But he's Mike said that the just opening an account with an iPhone is the easy single and their"
"1066850","1067510"," numbers are the best. "
"1068270","1073470"," Speaking of chips, Intel's going to announce some processors today that might improve the AI story."
"1073930","1075630"," That's the second best down name of the year."
"1076170","1078090"," I know and I got a hand to them. "
"1078190","1078970"," They are making a turn."
"1079550","1080930"," But AMD is ahead of them."
"1081550","1083350"," And Nvidia is the king. "
"1085470","1086610"," Did he is the king?"
"1087450","1093030"," Did you breathe the piece in the journal or the piece in in New York?"
"1093490","1094790"," I did read the New York piece."
"1095110","1096130"," Yeah, on Jensen, absolutely."
"1096450","1098270"," I think the Denny's great, great, great story. "
"1098430","1099470"," I remember what he said about Intel."
"1100450","1102490"," I flee Intel every chance I get."
"1102630","1103210"," That was fantastic. "
"1105650","1108050"," I urge people to read it because you need to know who this man is."
"1108470","1114090"," In our never-ending sort of discussion about advances in AI and generative AI and where we are"
"1114090","1120730"," guys, I don't know if you saw the latest entry from Tesla in terms of its optimist robot."
"1121550","1124210"," See what this thing can do?"
"1125950","1128210"," It can pick up an egg now. "
"1130590","1131330"," That's a robot."
"1134670","1135370"," There's an egg."
"1135630","1138210"," That is, by the way, that's huge right there. "
"1138290","1139330"," I see an egg."
"1139790","1144090"," Because that was really, hand me a manipulation is a key here."
"1144270","1146170"," I mean, of course it can walk, it can dance. "
"1147190","1148590"," But now it's got brand new hands."
"1149130","1149810"," I see you."
"1149810","1153770"," When you put generative AI in that thing and who knows what we got?"
"1153910","1155050"," Okay, I see you with the hand and the egg. "
"1155690","1157730"," But how about a dog that can pick up cello?"
"1159530","1161130"," Jensen, dogs picking up cello?"
"1163050","1163450"," Bingo."
"1165570","1165970"," No?"
"1166770","1169830"," We all need, we all need jello picking up dogs."
"1170170","1171210"," Do you know how hard it is to pick up cello?"
"1171590","1174270"," Listen, this thing can walk all over your house. "
"1174430","1176950"," It could probably make you breakfast pretty soon."
"1177210","1179970"," I, you know, I talked, I did not talk about it."
"1179970","1180270"," I went to watch it. "
"1180270","1183150"," By the way, they say they're a year away from this thing being able to thread a needle."
"1184950","1185310"," Really?"
"1185850","1185990"," Yes."
"1186490","1187790"," Well, okay, I can do that now. "
"1188450","1192010"," And you remember when Musk said we're going to have a robot for every person?"
"1192770","1194210"," One on one, one on one ratio?"
"1195050","1195430"," I know."
"1195610","1199290"," Well, it's just, I'm just just from where we're about to see them all be much more."
"1199470","1200130"," And it dances. "
"1200550","1206330"," So if you want to have a look at it."
"1216990","1219350"," Hey, you've got, I've seen you in question, nothing."
"1219830","1220490"," In question, nothing. "
"1220690","1221810"," Those were nice moves."
"1222010","1223510"," Now David, yes, Jim."
"1223810","1226870"," This just makes you even more fearful, I presume. "
"1227170","1227410"," Of course."
"1227790","1232190"," Because Johnson knew you last night, Johnson and Ryan Adobe said, look, don't, don't have to worry"
"1232190","1232570"," about it."
"1232950","1233370"," Right. "
"1233910","1235270"," Because it's going to have an off-on switch."
"1235750","1235750"," Sure."
"1236230","1236310"," Right. "
"1237110","1238470"," Come on, you remember that Will Smith movie?"
"1239530","1239950"," It's a good movie."
"1240330","1240550"," A robot?"
"1241070","1241090"," Yeah."
"1241210","1242770"," It's not an absolute device. "
"1242770","1251150"," I just think that the fear I have is the fear of they have a hundred people, a hundred this"
"1251150","1252570"," brain that's in any brain."
"1252870","1255870"," When it's got a higher intelligence than we have and it's fully mobile."
"1256450","1258990"," Well, oh yeah, they're going to be, they're going to have to know, they're going to just be our"
"1258990","1259210"," slaves. "
"1259630","1262530"," Well, no, I think maybe it could be the other way around."
"1263070","1268150"," Well, Johnson does, he will give this and say, I want a summary of this."
"1269030","1271790"," And he gets the summary of it and he does this actually in real life. "
"1271970","1273070"," That's the summary of a minute."
"1273270","1274470"," No, I'm sitting here reading it."
"1274790","1280170"," You know, I'm sitting here reading about WK Kellogg and he's like got the summary and he knows he"
"1280170","1280810"," doesn't need to read it. "
"1281030","1282350"," He is the edge on me."
"1283070","1283430"," Jensen."
"1284090","1290030"," So he's thinking about humanity and the war with machines and you're like my solar hole WK Kellogg. "
"1290070","1290210"," Yeah."
"1290510","1291990"," Trying to find out about his history."
"1292550","1296250"," At his start as a sanitarium in Michigan there. "
"1296390","1297370"," Was not what it started with."
"1297490","1300190"," And then he fed everybody, you know, he gave everybody sort of nice breakfast."
"1300470","1302390"," Well, all I know is his state. "
"1302530","1302910"," Battle Creek."
"1303130","1303550"," He said it."
"1303650","1303890"," Yes. "
"1304130","1304810"," That's Kellogg."
"1305030","1305090"," Yeah."
"1305670","1306450"," Oh, I know it's his state. "
"1306690","1308470"," I read the things that are superfluous."
"1308590","1309850"," I don't know this superfluous."
"1310670","1312990"," Jensen would say, don't give me this superfluous. "
"1314490","1318450"," Guys, real quick back to, I mean, if you've got a lot of debt, you're having a heck of a"
"1318450","1318630"," debt."
"1318690","1319190"," Is it one process?"
"1319430","1321450"," I mean, they're even buying all teas."
"1321970","1322530"," Oh, really?"
"1322870","1326390"," Yeah, it's up 22% all teas, which be careful. "
"1327150","1334430"," But Rivian, Lucid, in other words, if you have a huge need for capital and or you'd refinancing"
"1334430","1336790"," needs or financing needs, your stock is up sharply."
"1337370","1343590"," By the way, I would add on Rivian and Lucid, which were up over 9%."
"1343590","1345570"," Rivian did find some due to AT&T. "
"1345690","1354910"," AT&T a new war."
"1354990","1359510"," We're in a moment where what was left for dead is fantastic."
"1360170","1363610"," How about you want to bang out Oxy Berkshire and New Corp?"
"1363910","1365010"," This is just by the darn thing. "
"1365410","1368330"," Yeah, it looks like Warren just buys it all the time."
"1368450","1369410"," He's got a huge percentage."
"1369770","1371250"," $600 million in three days?"
"1371510","1372450"," What's he up to now?"
"1372670","1373190"," Percent or twice?"
"1373590","1373930"," Where is it?"
"1373930","1374090"," $27?"
"1375270","1375270"," $27?"
"1377510","1378430"," It's pretty amazing, right?"
"1378630","1379030"," Does it quietly?"
"1379570","1379970"," It's a lot. "
"1379970","1386810"," I mean, by the way, with Apple though, you sell these things and then his Apple position alone is a"
"1386810","1388390"," hundred and something billion dollars."
"1388630","1389370"," That's pretty good."
"1389510","1390150"," A lot more, right?"
"1390470","1395290"," So, I mean, again, you can't do a little dark throw here and hit a lot of stocks. "
"1395770","1396090"," You can."
"1396290","1396750"," They're going higher."
"1396970","1397730"," They're just a nice day. "
"1397910","1402550"," I mean, the broader average is, but if you are to the point, Carl made of course the banks and"
"1402550","1406630"," or a levered balance sheet, need for capital, you are having a very good day."
"1406750","1411770"," And so, cable also, which consumes good amount of capital, Comcast shares are up almost three"
"1411770","1413250"," percent, chargers up four percent."
"1413250","1414930"," We work for Comcast, shouldn't we?"
"1414930","1415350"," Yes, we do. "
"1415610","1416370"," I like to say that one."
"1416390","1419490"," I mean, if also, if you're just a disaster in terms of your capital."
"1419630","1419830"," Dish?"
"1420390","1421990"," Dish is actually having a good day. "
"1422390","1422450"," Dish."
"1422870","1423070"," 10 percent."
"1423910","1426730"," Well, I mean, so what, we just have a holiday where we can buy whatever we want. "
"1426810","1429610"," Yeah, today's the day, because they're going to live on for longer."
"1429930","1432810"," Well, so Walgreens, Boots leads the Dow kind of day."
"1433150","1438150"," Well, what's amazing is, is that in-phase energy, which has been the consummate dog, because it"
"1438150","1442930"," turned out not to be solar, it turned out to be finance, second day in a row that the stock"
"1442930","1445190"," is scorching, scorching. "
"1446010","1446750"," Think about that one."
"1447310","1452270"," You think JP Morgan's only up a lot less in the big banks, because Jamie Dimon has not been right"
"1452270","1454050"," on rates, and so people are taking out on them."
"1454230","1457270"," Well, he also, I mean, that's least levered. "
"1457570","1458450"," I'd rather own US bank."
"1458690","1458930"," I'm kidding."
"1459270","1462030"," But remember when Dimon was saying, what, where were we headed?"
"1462030","1462490"," Seven?"
"1463230","1463710"," Yeah. "
"1463850","1464190"," Seven percent?"
"1464630","1466250"," Yeah, he was, he was wrong on that."
"1466490","1471190"," Although his, his geopolitical worries, there's no reason to think those are less relevant, right?"
"1471350","1476650"," No, but I do know that this is about, this is a rally about the finance companies that need"
"1476650","1476890"," finance."
"1477450","1478150"," That's what's happening. "
"1480650","1481330"," Well said."
"1482110","1482750"," The guys are right."
"1483010","1487650"," One percent gains for the banks, for energy, industrials, consumer discretionary. "
"1488690","1491670"," A lot's working well today, even with the Dow up only a hundred points."
"1491670","1496150"," Quick reminder, you can get in on the CNBC investing club with Jim, to sign up and find out more"
"1496150","1500110"," at cmbc.com slash join the club or use the QR code on your screen."
"1500210","1500990"," It takes you right there. "
"1501310","1503070"," There's a little more data on the way today."
"1503270","1506690"," Business inventories in about 15 minutes, that balance sheet tonight."
"1507390","1513430"," But it's all about the curve and certainly what rates have done in the past say 18, 24 hours with"
"1513430","1515090"," the 10 years still below four. "
"1515290","1515730"," Back in a moment."
"1722080","1723900"," We mentioned the dollar today."
"1724120","1729340"," I haven't talked about the ECB or the B.O.E. both holding ECB trimming their installation forecast"
"1729340","1730200"," for next year. "
"1730400","1731220"," They were at 3-2."
"1731320","1736500"," They go down to 2-7 and the B.O.E. says it's way too early to speculate about cuts."
"1737260","1739000"," Interesting also a surprise hike out of Norway. "
"1739700","1740760"," 25 basis points."
"1741460","1745180"," Dow for the meantime up 83 points will get stopped taking the gym after a break."
"1913030","1914010"," 50% off. "
"1917530","1918490"," Let's get the gym started."
"1918850","1922550"," Well, Carl, it is at times they are changing Bob Dylan market."
"1922630","1926550"," People the slow ones now will later be fast and what I see is this. "
"1927090","1930230"," I don't want to buy the L.T.s.s. I want to think about the next day or the"
"1930230","1930670"," next day."
"1930750","1933370"," I don't want to recommend a stock that's up three to four that provides no value."
"1933950","1936210"," Proctoring gambles to stock has been hurt the most by currency. "
"1936210","1938670"," They said there would be $800 million hit currency."
"1939050","1941150"," It was going to wipe out other gains from the client and commodities."
"1941810","1943550"," They got crushed in Argentina. "
"1943850","1944610"," They've moved out of that."
"1945230","1947570"," This is the company that has a good yield."
"1948110","1948850"," They have an interest to crack. "
"1949330","1950170"," We'll do well."
"1950510","1952670"," But look, today it's an A student."
"1953010","1953650"," They don't want the A students. "
"1954130","1957010"," In the end you come back to the honor roll and this company is summa cum laude."
"1957350","1960570"," So no worries about lack of pricing power or..."
"1960570","1963090"," No, because their intellectual property has been really good."
"1963290","1965830"," They've been able to take price pretty much consistently. "
"1966610","1969230"," It's not the kind of stock people want now, but I just don't want..."
"1969230","1974870"," I'm mindful of what David was saying, which is that they're buying stocks that if they're trying to"
"1974870","1978650"," buy something, an algorithm saying buy it and then have someone take you out of it."
"1978830","1979710"," That's a great full theory."
"1980210","1985830"," I like a stock like this because it's for sale and it is the biggest beneficiary of the big cap"
"1985830","1987930"," stocks of a week dollar. "
"1988350","1988590"," That's good."
"1989110","1989410"," How about tonight?"
"1989930","1998750"," Okay, I have a stock Chewy, which makes pictures of your dogs, is a company that prosper for a long"
"1998750","2002070"," time and then Amazon came in and I think Amazon crushed it."
"2002150","2003230"," But I think they have a good business model. "
"2003430","2003990"," We haven't won that right."
"2005510","2006650"," What a wild day, huh?"
"2006730","2007410"," It is kind of crazy."
"2008030","2012310"," The best rustles up, strongest in more than 10 months. "
"2012630","2015990"," Yeah, there's someone on Frank's show that talked about that's really where the action is."
"2016270","2021730"," I prefer to buy a Wells Fargo or Morgan Stanley, which is my travel trust zones and lagged the"
"2021730","2025450"," market hit his league down a lot and that's another thing to buy."
"2026190","2028030"," Wells Fargo and Charlie Sharf's doing a good job. "
"2028430","2029030"," No one cares."
"2030370","2030930"," Sharf's great."
"2031170","2032110"," Nobody gets a Sharf. "
"2033370","2034270"," You know Charlie, right?"
"2034650","2035430"," I'd do a bit."
"2035930","2036670"," Should we come?"
"2037910","2039950"," After you dance a little bit more on our way out."
"2040050","2045950"," We don't need dance party. "
"2046370","2047210"," I don't get it."
"2047489","2050250"," That's probably what we're going to have to take off because we suddenly won't be needed here."
"2050290","2051790"," I've got a split screen here. "
"2051850","2052409"," Yeah, really quick."
"2052550","2054210"," Before we go, you know, one more."
"2054550","2055710"," That's not just a break dancing. "
"2055989","2056170"," I know."
"2056350","2059429"," Look, but Sam always said there's no need for any other space."
"2060270","2062909"," Bad money, 6 p.m. Eastern time. "
"2063150","2066170"," When we come back, our passions playbook for 24 in a minute."
"2239410","2240170"," I'm a member."
"2249160","2250480"," Good Thursday morning. "
"2250800","2252520"," Welcome to another hour of walk on the street."
"2252520","2254640"," I'm Sarah Eiffen, the Carlken to Nia and David favor."

"2263240","2264940"," of the third of one percent."
"2265140","2267340"," The S&P 500 of a half of a percent."
"2267640","2272980"," The Nasdaq comp up six tenths of one percent again after the big rally that we saw yesterday in the"
"2272980","2277440"," wake of that bond move big bond rally as well after Powell every sector is higher except for"
"2277440","2279120"," staples and health care today. "
"2279380","2284420"," The charge is being led by real estate interest rate sensitive sector and there's the story on"
"2284420","2289380"," yields 10 year note yield below four percent, which is where it got after Powell yesterday."
"2290000","2294260"," So more buying of treasuries and more lower yields the two year four point three."
"2294460","2295940"," We're 30 minutes here into the trading session. "
"2296260","2298180"," Here's some three movers that we're watching."
"2298180","2302320"," Adobe is under pressure after issuing a lighter than expected forecast for 2024."
"2303200","2308000"," The company says it's carefully looking at spending and remains focused on closing its 20 billion"
"2308000","2309520"," dollar acquisition of Figma. "

"2335200","2339620"," It's been one of the key stocks behind the Dow's rally past 37,000 for the first time ever."
"2340060","2345360"," We'll have more Apple news and talk more about some of the other names leading the Dow a little bit"
"2345360","2346140"," later this hour. "
"2346440","2348120"," Got business inventories out this morning."
"2348140","2349180"," Let's get to Rick Santelli."
"2349380","2349720"," Morning Rick. "
"2349720","2351520"," Good morning."
"2351780","2353100"," Oh, yes, it's my fault."
"2353480","2359060"," Hotel inventory have been mostly negative month over month change for most of 2023. "
"2359340","2364540"," Business inventory is a bit of a different model except for this month we are down one tenth of a"
"2364540","2366140"," percent as expected."
"2366720","2371260"," That means you'd have to go to June when we were also down a tenth percent to find a lower"
"2371260","2371500"," number."
"2371500","2376800"," You'd have to go to March but one two three four months so far the year have been negative. "
"2377160","2381700"," That's about half on the wholesale inventory side and it does underscore how things are slowly"
"2381700","2386320"," starting to get back to normal but you want to pay attention to these numbers especially if you're"
"2386320","2391920"," monitoring of course the beginning of the fourth quarter and how things may fare with regard to"
"2391920","2392520"," holiday sales."
"2393120","2397280"," One thing I want to point out here if two years close right here they'd be at a six and"
"2397280","2403500"," a half month low yield close of tens closed here it'd be nearly five months but more importantly"
"2403500","2410880"," look at the following charts two year note yields are now down on the year they closed last year at"

"2420840","2422160"," Sarah back to you. "
"2422320","2426960"," It's amazing so we just wiped out a year of high yields basically."
"2427490","2432860"," Whole year unbelievable thank you Rick it speaks to how ferocious the treasury rally has been post"
"2432860","2438500"," fed guys and we also just got in the last hour the news conference from ECB president Christine"
"2438500","2445720"," Lagarde who also paused on rape hikes but had a very different message for the market surrounding"
"2445720","2447360"," rate cuts listen."
"2449280","2454480"," We did not we did not discuss rate cuts at all. "
"2456100","2462280"," No discussion no debate on this issue and I think everybody in the room takes the view that between"
"2462280","2467860"," high can cut there's a whole plateau whole beach of hold."
"2469140","2474060"," That was very different than the message we heard from Fed Chair Powell yesterday on the subject of"
"2474060","2474720"," rate cuts listen."
"2477880","2483600"," A question of when will it become appropriate to begin dialing back the amount of policy restraint"
"2483600","2490220"," in place that begins to come into view and is clearly a discussion topic of discussion now in the"
"2490220","2494240"," world and also a discussion for us at our meeting today. "
"2495300","2501440"," They discussed it at the meeting today so very different message David I think underscores why"
"2501440","2507240"," Powell was remarkably and surprisingly dovish it started with the three rate cuts that were"
"2507240","2512500"," penciled into their summary of economic projections I think I and a lot of people were surprised by"
"2512500","2517280"," that and then it continued with the statement where we knew they were going to maybe make some"
"2517280","2521980"," tweaks around the language about the tightening bias they added the word any policy firming instead"
"2521980","2527520"," of additional policy firming so that was a pretty wealth well telegraph signal that they're in a"
"2527520","2531700"," different mode and then the biggest came in the news conference when he said that they're talking"
"2531700","2535540"," about cuts when he said that they're probably at peak rates I mean there are a number of different"
"2535540","2541280"," ways you can point to it but he did not talk down the market from the rate cuts and in"
"2541280","2546320"," fact added fuel to that fire and a lot of the economists this morning are out revising their cut"
"2546320","2552440"," schedule next year adding in faster and more of them yeah and as you pointed out not what was"
"2552440","2557560"," expected look look at this look at his pivot yeah December 1st that was the last time we heard from"
"2557560","2561840"," him it came in less than two weeks it would be premature to speculate on when policy might ease"
"2561840","2569060"," yesterday rate cuts are something that what changed in 12 days well we did get some inflation"
"2569060","2575200"," reports pce and cpi and they show that they continue to be benign I don't know I don't have"
"2575200","2580360"," reporting on whether he's been speaking to to treasury secretary yellen but after my conversation"
"2580360","2585740"," with her yesterday he very much is coming around to her view remember this is what she said about"
"2585740","2589700"," the potential for rate cuts I mean she wouldn't go that far because she doesn't want to interfere"
"2589700","2597300"," with fed policy now at treasury but the listener she said as inflation moves down it's in a way"
"2597300","2603980"," natural for interest rate should come down somewhat because real interest rates with otherwise"
"2603980","2612120"," increase which content to tighten financial conditions but you know they have two risks to manage"
"2612120","2620380"," one that is that inflation doesn't come down back toward their target as they envision and the"
"2620380","2629820"," other is that the economy becomes too weak and I'm gonna leave that call to them leave the call to"
"2629820","2635380"," them but said it's natural to think of bringing interest rates down as inflation comes lower and"
"2635380","2640560"," she also made some news by saying she expects inflation to have a two percent in front of it in"
"2640560","2646720"," other words to get to the fed target by the end of next year it feels like Powell and yellen"
"2646720","2652140"," again are very simpatico here on their view and he's and he's really come around to this idea of"
"2652140","2657560"," not worrying too much about 70s style inflation and worth reminding people I know most of our"
"2657560","2662720"," viewers know but she was chair of the fed and in fact right before he was which is why I"
"2662720","2665280"," always ask her about the fed even though she doesn't want to talk about the fed as treasury"
"2665280","2670700"," secretary but also why you know her economic views have been very important and have been spot on"
"2670700","2675120"," I'm sort of sick of the term soft landing because that's what it's all especially after talking to"
"2675120","2678820"," her it's all soft landing and and she's right it has been and she expects that to continue into"
"2678820","2683980"," next year but we got two data points this morning guys that confirm the soft landing or maybe we"
"2683980","2689520"," can call it immaculate disinflation or maybe we can call it growth without threatening inflation"
"2689520","2695020"," but it's all the same point which the market loves which is we're still getting growth and"
"2695020","2701860"," inflation rates are coming down jobless claims continue to defy expectations they're super low they"
"2701860","2706800"," fell again last week and then retail sales came in better than expected on the month of point three"
"2706800","2711520"," percent gain eight out of i think the 13 categories rose restaurants led the way and that's the"
"2711520","2716980"," only services category in the report but online sales were good electronic sales were good Sarah"
"2716980","2721560"," real quick just coming back to the top of your report what is what accounts for the differential"
"2721560","2727060"," and language between the ECB and our fed well one factor could be that the ECB has a single mandate"
"2727060","2732520"," on inflation and so if it's not at their target they have to be squarely focused on fighting it and"
"2732520","2737340"," can't let their guard down i think that was the exact language she used the fed also has a mandate"
"2737340","2742360"," to keep employment you know strong and and they look at growth so because they're weighing both of"
"2742360","2746840"," those the fed doesn't want to wreck the good economy that it has in the face of falling inflation"
"2746840","2751620"," that's a big part of it because the bank of England was also out this morning and much more in"
"2751620","2756600"," the ECB camp of you know we still may have some work to do i think they use that term"
"2756600","2761940"," on inflation and not signaling cuts because they're much more focused on the inflationary story"
"2761940","2768120"," david but i think we will continue to debate on this network and in the market about whether the"
"2768120","2774060"," fed is premature here when it comes to talking about rate cuts with core inflation still at four"
"2774060","2779160"," percent double the target and the unemployment rate at 3.7 percent which is not really threatening"
"2779160","2784340"," a big decline with a big decline in the economy there's no doubt about that we're definitely going"
"2784340","2790100"," to debate it yields falling stocks off the highs here dows up 43 now on the heels of pal our"
"2790100","2794380"," senior economic supporter steve leesman joins us with more on what comes the next speaking of which"
"2794380","2803420"," steve i see breen now referring to claims and retail sales these they say no signs of a pickup in"
"2803420","2808700"," layoff activity but they do not think these provide fundamental support to the outlook on the fed"
"2808700","2815980"," funds yeah i mean we might be back into this zone now car where good news is bad news if"
"2815980","2822680"," you really want those cuts to come early and and there there be many of them i think also the"
"2822680","2830020"," retail sales report today is going to flatter the gdp numbers i haven't seen upward adjustments yet"
"2830020","2835180"," they were waiting for the inventory numbers to come through but later this afternoon or just in a"
"2835180","2840040"," few hours we'll get a few my guess is that people will upgrade that outlook for the fourth quarter"
"2840040","2845000"," which you remember the third quarter was a surprise why because the consumer was spending the"
"2845000","2850200"," fourth quarter might be a surprise too because the consumer continues to spend our cnbc nrf retail"
"2850200","2854520"," monitor data was actually spot on with where the government came in and pointing out this"
"2854520","2860280"," unexpected strength we've had in the consumer let me go back a second and add to sera's uh answer"
"2860280","2865460"," about the difference in the ecb and the fed i would also add to her i think i agree with"
"2865460","2870900"," all of her points but i would add that the fed was earlier in terms of raising interest rates and"
"2870900","2876920"," it also went further than the ecb went so the idea of the day would pivot earlier also make sense"
"2876920","2881940"," here the guard clearly not ready i liked her comment also where she said it's not time to let our"
"2881940","2887400"," guard down when it comes to inflation she's not ready yet to make that call and of course i would"
"2887400","2892900"," underscore sera's answer about them having the single mandate whereas powell's trying to really"
"2892900","2898080"," balance both mandates and you heard a lot yesterday from powell to my opinion anyway about how much"
"2898080","2902180"," concern there is about the other side of the mandate i don't know if the fed is looking at"
"2902180","2907720"," something scarier i think you're asking the right question what happened between december 1st and"
"2907720","2913020"," uh and today i went back and reread the whole interview at spelman and it's very hard to get from"
"2913020","2918000"," powell's last interview to where he is today i've got a couple of suspicions one is that the"
"2918000","2922920"," inflation numbers he had a more dovish read than the market did on it that was one and two is"
"2922920","2927520"," i think maybe his committee started to get a little more dovish than either he was or he was ready"
"2927520","2932600"," to go and the downside of all this which you guys are already uh trying with is have financial"
"2932600","2938100"," conditions loosen too much now that's going to make the job of fighting inflation harder yeah"
"2938100","2943120"," although on that point you mentioned gdp goldman goes to two which is almost double consensus and"
"2943120","2948560"," and yon's point last night was that uh some of these easing conditions from october on they think"
"2948560","2953860"," are durable because of what inflation's done um i think that's right and remember you had rick"
"2953860","2958780"," point out that the two years now down on the year which is quite remarkable now we did have michael"
"2958780","2963920"," gopin on squat box this morning he thinks financial conditions are still relatively tight or i"
"2963920","2968720"," guess tight enough for the federal reserve um but we'll just have to play it by ear i don't think"
"2968720","2975440"," it's if money's not free again just to be clear right and when you look at what the average Fed"
"2975440","2981300"," official is planning and you think about it in terms of real interest rates which is how many of"
"2981300","2987000"," them thinking about it the Fed is not seeing itself loosening up very much at all do the math and"
"2987000","2992600"," take the Fed funds rate minus their core pce rate which is imperfect in according to a lot of the"
"2992600","2997560"," the wonks out there but it's just a benchmark way of thinking about it they're still looking at 2.2"
"2997560","3003780"," percent real so the only reason they come down according to their own forecast is because inflation"
"3003780","3010860"," comes down they are not reducing interest rates to ease financial conditions so to speak steve"
"3010860","3016960"," thank you um and continue the conversation of course let's get more on the market implications of"
"3016960","3021420"," this move we want to bring in senior markets commentator mike santoli mike we've remarked on"
"3021420","3025300"," obviously any of those companies that are either highly leveraged or reliant on the financing"
"3025300","3030880"," markets for future growth and or just keeping their business going are benefiting today but what"
"3030880","3034820"," else are you seeing yeah i mean david it pushes off the day of of reckoning if there was going"
"3034820","3039660"," to be one for highly leveraged companies it probably puts a little bit of a refinancing refresh"
"3039660","3045160"," cycle out there gonna stoke a push of housing demand as well mortgage rates crashing so all those"
"3045160","3052320"," things underway i think what the market reaction did is it basically set the don't fight the fed"
"3052320","3058320"," and don't fight the tape rules in sync to say you know that we have this really uh pretty"
"3058320","3064240"," impressive bullish uptrend a breakout in the indexes and mostly and not just because you know the"
"3064240","3070620"," market is craving and and pushing for lower fed funds rate down the road but because pal explicitly"
"3070620","3077000"," tried to further delink fed policy in the short term from what the economy has to do to get us"
"3077000","3082840"," there right the the fed doesn't anymore uh need feel like it needs to really kneecap the economy to"
"3082840","3086220"," get the job done and i think in answer to the question you guys have been talking about what"
"3086220","3091220"," changed recently i really do think it's the preponderance of benign inflation numbers that have"
"3091220","3098700"," built up you've got this run of data that have not just been pretty much right center in line with"
"3098700","3104840"," the soft landing thesis but also coming in really close to forecast so i think no surprises and"
"3104840","3109800"," numbers that are exactly as you might want to draw them up have combined to create this confidence"
"3109800","3116300"," that the disinflation trend is reliable at the moment and there's time to figure out how that"
"3116300","3121480"," develops without having to do anything on rates for a little while so now in the very short term"
"3121480","3126660"," the stock market's quite extended um you know we did have this breakout it's really brought all to"
"3126660","3131580"," the good but you definitely are getting a little bit stretched out there and so many things have"
"3131580","3135860"," been working together you had the short squeeze low quality rally and stocks that have been left"
"3135860","3140880"," for dead you had the rate relief rally pressure off the bank's balance sheets the soft landing"
"3140880","3144800"," celebration and then you had the repositioning people just were not prepared for a strong stock"
"3144800","3149160"," market they need to raise exposure i think a lot of that stuff is probably played out maybe it's"
"3149160","3153740"," the first quarter's business to try and reconcile some of that and have a bit of a gut check and"
"3153740","3158260"," maybe we're going to have to you know kind of reset a little bit but for now it really did"
"3158260","3163300"," kind of check off all the markets boxes i know i know it's it's fed first when it comes to"
"3163300","3167980"," the market these days and the equity rally but now that we're getting to these levels i do under"
"3167980","3174300"," mic with the gdp picture subdued even if it takes higher for fourth quarter after retail sales"
"3174300","3179400"," earnings expectations how realistic are they into next year yeah i mean that's the question first"
"3179400","3183760"," of all the fourth quarter earnings uh forecast have been cut pretty significantly i mean it"
"3183760","3190320"," probably sets off a pretty easy beat cycle once we get the reports but i think the test of whether"
"3190320","3197020"," 2024 earnings are plausible it's out there probably a couple of quarters it's a back end loaded"
"3197020","3201980"," forecast at this point as you wouldn't be surprised to hear it is typically the stronger growth"
"3201980","3207460"," coming the latter half of the year but i think what the feds message and the sturdy current"
"3207460","3213400"," economic data do is it gives a longer leash for companies to prove that those numbers are plausible"
"3213400","3217080"," so the market might be able to look through a little more weakness than you might expect look we"
"3217080","3224260"," got you know warnings from adobe and oracle and fizer and etsy and if they don't really seem to be"
"3224260","3228920"," causing that many ripple effects in other companies because they think we're willing to give the"
"3228920","3234420"," benefit of the doubt they're also coming from companies that had been weaker and struggling whether"
"3234420","3239320"," that's your hasbro before thank you very much mike san totally as we had to break here's our road"
"3239320","3251400"," map for the rest of the hour the road for"
"3251400","3257540"," auto stock in 2024 we have some topics for you the down topic 37k for the first time we'll do"
"3257540","3261680"," to look at the stocks that are fueling those gains and a number of home builders are also hitting"
"3261680","3266120"," new highs we're going to discuss what is ahead for these companies and their stocks this is of"
"3266120","3271220"," course is the fed here's to be focused now on potentially cutting rates next year a lot more squawk"

"3456150","3460030"," time of year your best picks i guess were you hard pressed to find one in auto so you had"
"3460030","3464490"," to go to borg warner i mean i've liked borg for a while i mean i am very bearish on"
"3464490","3469490"," the auto sector in general why why why borg no why are you bearish on the auto sector i mean"
"3469490","3473550"," i think there's really probably four key reasons one i think we're probably at peak profits for the"
"3473550","3477230"," industry and i think a lot of that's driven by pricing i mean we're at record pricing i think"
"3477230","3480710"," that's going to come down if you look at the Detroit three they've all collectively gotten 10"
"3480710","3485130"," billion dollars of pricing help over the since covid you know two i think people haven't paid any"
"3485130","3490330"," attention to capacity uh the industry has probably going to see close to a 20 percent increase in"
"3490330","3495690"," capacity we know historically that's terrible for profitability what happens is auto makers feel"
"3495690","3500150"," pressured to utilize that capacity and pricing starts coming down so it really feeds into the"
"3500150","3506450"," pricing concern three you know electric vehicles right so i think people are very excited by the"
"3506450","3510810"," fact there's moderation and EV demand because these are unprofitable but i think they're missing is"
"3510810","3515650"," the regulations that are behind all of this and so for 2026 you're going to need nine you know"
"3515650","3520490"," maybe nine or ten percent EVs for the Detroit three they're at you know zero to four percent right"
"3520490","3524330"," now so they're going to need more of these unprofitable vehicles on the way to get there and the"
"3524330","3528010"," last thing i don't think people are paying attention to is pickups so if you look at pickups which"
"3528010","3533350"," are historically the vast majority of profits for the Detroit three their inventory has been"
"3533350","3537770"," creeping up and the sales are fairly flat and it's been very distracting market with the strikes"
"3537770","3542090"," and the supply chain volatility but the end of the day historically there's a good correlation"
"3542090","3547430"," between housing starts and pickup sales and it makes sense because contractors are a big customer"
"3547430","3552110"," base so i think you have you know a lot of negative reasons for the industry in the next year"
"3552110","3555950"," it's very little that's actually good news in the next year all right now we'll go to board one i"
"3555950","3560470"," appreciate your sort of rounding that up for us why is that something within the industry that you"
"3560470","3565770"," do feel is perhaps something to buy well i think if you look at it the suppliers historically can"
"3565770","3570210"," perform well especially high quality suppliers even when their customers are struggling this is a"
"3570210","3575370"," globally diversified company they're cheap i mean they're if you look at you strip out some of the"
"3575370","3579190"," pricing health this year suppliers have been getting from cost recoveries they are one of the"
"3579190","3582890"," fastest growers this year and yet they're not trading at a premium to the group they're trading in"
"3582890","3587570"," line with the group there's also a company that has executed really well since covid when there's"
"3587570","3590910"," been so much volatility and i think we're going to see more volatility for the suppliers next year"
"3590910","3595070"," we're going to have labor costs inflation there's going to be some fx issues so you know i'd rather"
"3595070","3599270"," stick with a name that is executed through all the volatility recently just on the demand question"
"3599270","3604430"," i'm looking at the retail sales report today auto motor parts and parts dealers 6.1 percent growth"
"3604430","3612310"," from this time last year november number i mean it continues to show strong demand doesn't it well"
"3612310","3617190"," i mean we're still seeing SAR up year over year but SAR has been fairly flat so new auto sales"
"3617190","3621510"," have been sort of flat lining in the low 15s they're creeping up a little bit and there's probably"
"3621510","3626590"," upside to auto sales but what i think what we're seeing is inventory is up all around and if demand"
"3626590","3631030"," was so high at current price levels we'd actually be at a 17 million SAR which is where we were"
"3631030","3636110"," before covid so normal demand is probably 16 17 so there's actually a problem that we're only at 15"
"3636110","3639610"," and we have plenty of inventory out there which means that we're going to need to cut prices if we"
"3639610","3643450"," want to get that volume which goes back to the capacity issue because if we have all this unused"
"3643450","3648390"," capacity then there's pressure to cut prices because you're sitting on all these fixed costs Colin"
"3648390","3652290"," we're going to leave it there for today but thank you appreciate it thanks still to come this"
"3652290","3656130"," morning as we said the Dow tops 37k for the first time we're going to closer look at some of"

"5403130","5408590"," an important 24 hours we just had what does this new rate environment uh do to some of these"
"5408590","5414230"," builders margins and orders it's definitely a tailwind certainly and look you look at the playbook"
"5414230","5419110"," for next year which you think is definitely going to be turbocharged by what happened yesterday i"
"5419110","5423210"," think the playbook and the outlook for next year looks pretty summer so this year actually for the"
"5423210","5428850"," industry still limited existing inventory out there we don't really see that changing so there's a"
"5428850","5434270"," market share shift underway where new homes serve a lot of locations of the only game in town the"
"5434270","5440790"," public builders they have size scale access to capital that allows them to grow their inventory buy"
"5440790","5446470"," down interest rates that's attractive for the end user and for buyer so there's really a market"
"5446470","5451510"," share shift going on where the demand is being funneled to new homes it's being funneled to home"
"5451510","5456970"," builders and for the stocks we think it's a group that's really grown up these management teams the"
"5456970","5462470"," public builders collectively they're very focused on returns they've really adjusted how they think"
"5462470","5467150"," about deploying capital so you roll that all up in the blender we think there are some fundamental"
"5467150","5474150"," tailwinds here and i think an outlook that's really quite positive for the industry and for the"
"5474150","5480770"," sector overall is there an argument that if rates come down enough that it unleashes a supply of"
"5480770","5486690"," existing homes and the new builders do face more competition yeah it's kind of odd to think more"
"5486690","5491550"," interest rates might not be a good thing for home builders for certain this tailwind in terms of"
"5491550","5496610"," limited existing inventory the reason why there's not much existing inventory out there is because"
"5496610","5502730"," 40% of those homeowners with the mortgage have a rate below 4% so if you have a mortgage"
"5502730","5509050"," rate that's at 3% 3.5% trading that for a 7% mortgage doesn't really make a whole"
"5509050","5514390"," lot of financial sense obviously if rates start to tick down that math starts to change a little"
"5514390","5519550"," bit more so it is possible you could get some incremental inventory coming on to the market next"
"5519550","5524510"," year but our perspective is lower rates would be a good thing for demand that would offset any"
"5524510","5529410"," incremental supply that might come and then for the home builders if rates are lower likely means"
"5529410","5534030"," they don't have to offer as much in terms of incentives that's a tailwind for their gross margin"
"5534030","5539250"," too so from our perspective with rates potentially moving lower next year mortgage rates moving"
"5539250","5545490"," lower as well we think that's a tailwind still for the industry I mean it was a funny environment"
"5545490","5551610"," for home builders because the stocks actually did fine as inventory's were low and prices remained"
"5551610","5557710"," high Tyler is there worry that that prices could go even higher now if this unleashes a lot of"
"5557710","5563210"," activity in the mortgage market which would make the Fed worried again yeah it's definitely a"
"5563210","5573050"," potential risk and the supply demand imbalance that's in the running through their P&L"
"5573050","5577490"," this year you're going to see the impact from some of the higher incentives activity level earlier"
"5577490","5583370"," in 2023 but you look towards next year especially the back half of the year you know if interest"
"5583370","5588830"," rates cooperate even stay the same as where they are right now you know there's going to be demands"
"5588830","5593350"," and the builders are trying to meet that demand with more supply but again the key to this whole"
"5593350","5597590"," story is if there's not a whole lot of existing inventory out there on the market there's going to"
"5597590","5602330"," be more demand than there is supply you know simple economics and that sort of a situation should"
"5602330","5607770"," give the builders pricing power and the ability to raise prices yeah we're watching that 30 year"

"5960430","5968270"," it i'm not bearish i've been cautious and we continue to be cautious and maybe more excited about"
"5968270","5973750"," other asset classes i'm a little surprised by the euphoria on the market by what Powell said"
"5973750","5979250"," because it wasn't so surprising everyone expected them to stay static with rates and i think"
"5979250","5986030"," everyone expected rates to be cut next year so it's not so surprising when they cut rates whether"
"5986030","5992630"," it's March or July i don't think matters because remember monetary policy lags in the market so"
"5992630","5999110"," we'll still be feeling the effects of the higher rates for longer in the market next year i think"
"5999110","6005070"," what's really interesting and where we see opportunities in the equity sector is in the asset"

"6011890","6017210"," really in what i'm calling the terrific 10 right 10 stocks responsible for 80 percent of market"
"6017210","6024030"," returns and you can find a lot of value in those securities that are left behind and we're seeing"
"6024030","6029130"," that actually since Powell statements like you just mentioned there are real estate utilities"
"6029130","6034810"," they're really driving this charge in the last two days and those are areas where we're expecting"
"6034810","6041150"," to see out performance next year because the rally broadens out because they got too cheap what is"
"6041150","6046830"," the other totally under value these mega cap tech stocks just drove this market performance when"
"6046830","6052430"," you look at the equal weighted return of the market it's about 10 or 11 percent and actually"
"6052430","6059450"," remember my job is responsible growth of client capital but also preservation of client capital and"
"6059450","6064230"," when you look at the two-year annualized returns because everyone forgets that last year was down"
"6064230","6070690"," so significantly it's like two or two and a half percent so if we still protect on the downside and"
"6070690","6077450"," we're not out of equities we're just not overweight or so concentrated in 10 securities but we are"
"6077450","6084190"," seeing undervalued sectors and opportunities as we enter 2024 that we're excited about that's just"
"6084190","6088390"," in large cap are you looking at small and as well and in every asset class i mean this year"
"6088390","6093250"," you know large has done better than small and mid developed over emerging markets and we're"
"6093250","6098910"," probably still favoring those but within every sub asset class of the equity market we're seeing"
"6098910","6104250"," opportunities in markets where there's more volatility and more uncertainty like the market that i"
"6104250","6110030"," think we're in today and we will continue to be a next year we favor active management overall"
"6110030","6116730"," those asset classes because we think fundamental analysis is so important to identify the companies"
"6116730","6122890"," that aren't so sensitive to interest rates and are undervalued and perhaps unappreciated in 2023"
"6122890","6128750"," and where we can see the opportunity for outside growth but but let's remember the fixed income"
"6128750","6136250"," market is still offering equity like long-term returns with much less risk and much less volatility"
"6136250","6144250"," so we're extending duration there to lock in higher rates for longer for our clients with equity"
"6144250","6149670"," exposure so if you had to choose you choose fixed income over bonds over stocks at the moment we're"
"6149670","6155410"," overweight equities we were overweight fixed income apologies we're neutral on equities and we"
"6155410","6160310"," continue to be overweight alternatives because i think we're capital is scarce and in tightening"
"6160310","6164930"," credit markets there are very few places to go so if you have money and you can lend in the"
"6164930","6170090"," private credit space we really do like that area what is your what is the new burger outlook on"
"6170090","6177510"," growth next year so our outlook on growth is we're cautious we are cautious you know we think"
"6177510","6185870"," economic growth is going to slow and with respect to the pace of rate cuts whether it happens in"
"6185870","6192310"," March whether it happens in June I think we don't expect all of it to happen in the first quarter"
"6192310","6198790"," and if it does that will be because there's something that is bad that has happened in the economy"
"6198790","6204670"," that the Fed is trying to protect against so I think there will be thoughtful and responsible cuts"
"6204670","6211910"," next year barring a surprise like inflation to the upside we think growth will slow and we think"
"6211910","6218030"," the job market is going to soften but in that environment we still see opportunities really in all"
"6218030","6223990"," asset classes in fixed income in equities and in areas that have been undervalued in alternatives"
"6223990","6230180"," you always love new needs you still like new needs yeah all right thank you Holly good to check in"
"6230180","6235600"," with you on a day like today especially Holly Newman crop from new burger it's a big day for Intel"
"6235600","6240500"," let's turn to the chip space they're making some AI announcements in the last hour focusing on the"
"6240500","6245100"," PC space Christina parts and envelopes is at the Nasdaq having talked with Pat Gelsinger hey"
"6245100","6252600"," Christina hi Carwell the race is on to be the first market with AI PCs like all of those PCs"
"6252600","6258460"," right behind me right now Intel says they are first despite Qualcomm actually announcing their own"
"6258460","6264040"," version very recently I caught up with Pat Gelsinger just this morning and he said they are already"
"6264040","6269320"," shipping these PCs and we'll have about a hundred million units in the market by year Zen that's"
"6269320","6274180"," actually quote five times according to them five times more their competition Qualcomm though"
"6274180","6280280"," speaking of competition AMD Intel they've all been pushing the AIPC right that means running AI"
"6280280","6285300"," applications directly locally on a PC so that you don't necessarily have to use the cloud it's"
"6285300","6291780"," better for battery and it should help boost the PC market especially as this refresh cycle begins"
"6291780","6300200"," next year in 2024 but recently Dell did warn of near-term softness in PC so I asked Pat about"
"6300200","6305380"," this this morning he said they're not changing their guidance at all and that's the problem though"
"6305380","6310360"," with this event here there's been actually no updates with any type of financial goals thus far"
"6310360","6315220"," Intel also launching their next generation CPU that's the new thing here today think of it like a"
"6315220","6320840"," system on a chip the Xion that you're seeing right now Intel has been losing market share to AMD in"
"6320840","6325820"," this category so it's important for this CPU to launch and for next iterations in the years to come"
"6325820","6332020"," lastly Gelsinger on stage just revealed the Gaudi3 chip which is a custom AI chip primarily used"
"6332020","6336040"," for training large language models with Gelsinger promising about a two billion dollar pipeline"
"6336040","6342000"," next year Gelsinger much like AMD CEO Lisa she told me just last week this market is big enough to"
"6342000","6348080"," offer a market for all of them even if Intel is offering a maybe a lower performance cheaper chip"
"6348080","6353080"," they have the supply for it that was a key point that he mentioned but what we're seeing here that"
"6353080","6358580"," takeaway from this giant event here too is that the theme is volume being the first to ship Intel"
"6358580","6363960"," is claiming that right now for the the PC chips that you're seeing behind me and for many of the"
"6363960","6368540"," other products and it's getting it out to market as soon as possible before the competition and"
"6368540","6374240"," that's what they're claiming right now all right Christina well stocks up by the way the whole by"
"6374240","6379780"," the losers of last year turned out to be true for Intel up 73 percent this year after sliding"

"6728050","6734510"," put it out there Sarah we've gotten a lot of feedback in terms of this set of proposals for the"
"6734510","6741350"," treasury market it's really important for the markets that we lower the risk in these markets you"
"6741350","6747530"," might remember as covid was breaking out around the world there were challenges in our u.s treasury"
"6747530","6754470"," market even the year before that in 2019 there were very significant challenges in the funding of"
"6754470","6760330"," the treasury market what's called the repurchase market and i would note this is a market that has"

"6781350","6785010"," curious what you're doing on ai because i know that that's new it's something you're focused on"
"6785010","6789870"," you've warned about the perils of ai when it comes to investment i think one that they could create"
"6789870","6796070"," a financial crisis so how are you tackling this issue i thank you i started studying this actually"
"6796070","6802010"," when i was honored to be up at mit as a professor artificial intelligence is the i really truly"
"6802010","6808430"," believe the most transformative technology of our time as transformative is the internet but even"
"6808430","6815870"," if you go back to the 1920s and the whole industrialization and the automobile ai is already being"
"6815870","6824010"," used across finance whether it's just in cost centers compliance uh various ways you can process"
"6824010","6830150"," claims that insurance companies and the like but it's also being used in those robo advising apps"
"6830150","6836150"," and brokerage apps that you might know of so what we've done is we did put out a proposal to"
"6836150","6841890"," with the simple concept that you need to keep the investors interest ahead of that of the"
"6841890","6849030"," investment advisor or broker dealer and you can't have the algorithm putting the investment advisor"
"6849030","6857510"," or the broker dealer ahead of the investor so gensler i'm wondering um the performance of these"
"6857510","6864210"," tools and their capabilities is it running ahead or are behind your initial expectations i would"
"6864210","6872410"," say that we're in a in a mode of acceleration that that the the technology curve if you wish is"
"6872410","6881030"," probably picking up and it's it's about the computational power and it's about the data analytics"
"6881030","6889890"," behind it uh the buzz of course is around generative ai but in finance it's already being used and"
"6889890","6895970"," i would say this i do think that there are natural economics around artificial intelligence that"
"6895970","6904150"," will lead to dominant or single source base models just like we've seen elsewhere in technology i"
"6904150","6911010"," mean we largely have one search engine that we all turn to or maybe three cloud providers i think"
"6911010","6917510"," similarly we'll end up with a very short list of base or foundation models in artificial"

"13097310","13101510"," show you the major averages uh the smp is having a nice day it's up about a half a percent"
"13101510","13107490"," but the equal weight smp 500 is doing even better and this has been what's going on all week"

"13154050","13159250"," starts moving quickly momentum traders go into these stocks because if the smp is up one percent"
"13159250","13163970"," they typically would be up say two percent on a day and an up market that's a lot of money"

"13226510","13232630"," continue into next year his base case is 5100 by year end bullish case takes us to 5500 next year"
"13232630","13237410"," for the smp joining me here on set now is basic chata chief global strategist at Deutsche Bank"
"13237410","13244230"," welcome to you let's rewind the clock for a minute shall we now do you often find yourself towards"
"13244230","13250110"," the top of the pack or was was a year ago kind of an aberration so i i would say"
"13250110","13253550"," a year ago we were at the top of the pack by the middle of the year we were in"
"13253550","13263230"," the middle of the pack right i would say you know so far i mean years not over there's still"
"13263230","13268410"," a couple of weeks tends to get a little slower as you go in and what we've seen of course"
"13268410","13274250"," you know is a very very steep rally so the counterpart of that is positioning has been rising i"
"13274250","13282550"," would say almost vertically which is not you know the healthiest sign and so yeah it would be just"
"13282550","13288090"," a little bit careful here but i don't think it's a big deal i think you know we had i"
"13288090","13295470"," would call it a game changer yesterday because i think you have to keep the macro backdrop in mind"
"13295470","13302550"," for about five six quarters now the macroeconomic consensus has been off the strong i would say"
"13302550","13310150"," almost unanimous view that growth was going to fall off a cliff that obviously hasn't happened and"
"13310150","13315390"," so that's the reason for why we got the rally but the cloud of you know are we still going"
"13315390","13322830"," to go into a recession it i would say remains as thick and loud as ever and and so i"
"13322830","13327770"," think what yesterday does is it definitely reduces the probabilities that we you know that that"
"13327770","13337610"," downside scenario materializes and so we should you know basically look for you know first it may"
"13337610","13344550"," be some upgrades to the macro consensus maybe some taking off of the downside and and i would not"
"13344550","13351250"," really underestimate the power of that consensus how strong it's been for how long it's been i"
"13351250","13357830"," would argue it's permeated through everything investor perceptions i would say growth's been pretty"
"13357830","13364850"," good but perceptions have been very very poor i would say companies are you know concerned about"
"13364850","13372730"," getting in front of this huge unanimous strong view and so guidance is poor i think so this you"
"13372730","13378730"," know does you know lift some of those clouds i think it would be a gradual process and so it"
"13378730","13382690"," was interesting to note your tone of caution a little bit about maybe this snapback has gone a"
"13382690","13386730"," little it's gotten a little extended i did check the CNN the fear and greed index one of my"
"13386730","13393390"," favorites and we're at 71 so we're almost in extreme greed territory but rarely i mean this is now"
"13393390","13398230"," widespread euphoria um you know you you could wait for some course correction but i do think it's"
"13398230","13403710"," important to just pause and say this year so far has played out contrary to how almost anyone had"
"13403710","13408570"," predicted are you bottoms up or top down how did you get to that 4500 number a year ago we"
"13408570","13416270"," are top down and uh what i would say is the very early part of the rally was really you"
"13416270","13422790"," know a call for a positioning squeeze and the positioning squeeze was really not about investors"
"13422790","13429090"," who were focused on the fundamentals of the market it was really a call for a positioning squeeze"
"13429090","13436650"," on systematic strategies because wall wall was a very very elevated last year that was courtesy of"
"13436650","13442590"," you know same people that gave us the wall yesterday uh it's it's really the the you know very"
"13442590","13447090"," volatile fed hiking cycle that we had and so you know very simple take would be if you looked at"
"13447090","13453850"," systematic strategies you know on on a z-score plus minus one they were at minus two and and it"
"13453850","13459910"," was all really coming from elevated wall so the call was really that rates of all would come down"
"13459910","13468130"," because unless they yeah so you know to maintain vol you need to sort of keep providing more and"
"13468130","13473110"," more shocks to the system so you know we're going to do 25 maybe we're going to do 50 75"
"13473110","13478290"," at some point you run a runway and at some point you've already raised rates quite a lot and that's"
"13478290","13484170"," exactly what happened but i would say after that comes really so the first part was the squeeze as"
"13484170","13490490"," we had you know taking stock over the year that just went by uh i would say then it's really"
"13490490","13496470"," about the fundamentals taking over and i would say yes we have this recession narrative on the"
"13496470","13504630"," macro yes it has not played out yet but if you look basically at earnings earnings peaked in the"
"13504630","13509290"," second quarter of last year fell in the third and the fourth but that was very very clear bottom"
"13509290","13516190"," and earnings are up basically pretty strongly this year i would say in the first nine months you"
"13516190","13521770"," know we've got 11 and a half percent earnings growth that's pretty good in nine months let me ask"
"13521770","13526590"," you a business cycle question and you know i'm very sympathetic to the arguments for the slowdown"
"13526590","13532010"," so i know them very well and you do look at the leading indicators and things like that and we've"
"13532010","13535990"," we're on in historic levels i mean the index of leading indicators is down for how many months in a"
"13535990","13540990"," row continuing jobless claims are up year on year the unemployment rate you know we almost hit that"
"13540990","13546030"," half a percent mark there's there's signs that can't get much better than this in other words that"
"13546030","13550310"," the business cycle is peaking and i'm just curious how long i know this might not exactly the way"
"13550310","13555610"," you evaluate the market but how long can we stay in a place like this as we start to talk"
"13555610","13561410"," about how much further the rally can extend next year so so you know i mean if you would allow"
"13561410","13567550"," me i would just change the question around a little bit uh and and and ask you know a rhetorical"
"13567550","13573730"," question i mean are we in ninety four ninety five or are we in ninety nine i would say there's"
"13573730","13580970"," many more parallels in ninety four ninety five so it is very possible for the cycle to go a very"
"13580970","13585210"," long ways from here interesting thing about that cycle and the soft landing that we got back then"
"13585210","13589650"," is we never saw a real tightening of of uh for instance in the senior loan officer survey those"
"13589650","13594570"," kinds of things that that never happened and that's happening now so it feels like those kinds of"
"13594570","13600010"," things point you towards a different outcome i'd say it is and it isn't because if you look at the"
"13600010","13607590"," senior loan officer survey for the last quarter it actually eased a little bit and if you look back"
"13607590","13615950"," basically at the sluice uh you know generally tends to peak in a recession has very very few fault"
"13615950","13625390"," turns so the in the 2001 recession you know we went down then we tightened again a little bit but"
"13625390","13630710"," it did mark the turning point in the end so i'm saying it may not be straight down but it"
"13630710","13637010"," has improved number one number two what i would say is that i actually don't pay i mean i pay"
"13637010","13641210"," attention to the sluice because everybody else pays attention to the sluice but you know do simple"
"13641210","13646850"," exercise and just overlay the sluice of the ism so not hard to do and you'll see that you know"
"13646850","13651610"," well the sluice is wide got a little better is because the ism spicked up a little bit uh they're"
"13651610","13658250"," pretty strongly positively correlated and so you know if if growth does pick up from here and this"
"13658250","13663910"," goes back to my very first point if you know the fed is not going to be hiking aggressively it"
"13663910","13670790"," does reduce it and maybe even easing uh you know i i i'm a little cautious there because we are"
"13670790","13677350"," talking about six months from now uh and then we just had two rather large changes one in two weeks"
"13677350","13682510"," than one in three months so it'd be a little hesitant to discuss six months out that we could talk"
"13682510","13686210"," about it of course but the one quick final question i think there's like 10 more things i'd love to"
"13686210","13691690"," ask you but i'll stick with this one so this was the year that the magnificent seven got their name"
"13691690","13698310"," literally um do you make a call so specific as to say whether that market leadership can continue"
"13698310","13704050"," or do you talk about kind of different leadership areas and curious what you would make of people"
"13704050","13707530"," who are trying to get a little bit more tactical yeah so so i would say two things you know"
"13707530","13712810"," uh obviously a lot of people point to the magnificent seven and say the rally has been you know"
"13712810","13719550"," very thin and narrow i think it's very important to keep in mind that basically uh you know"
"13719550","13723690"," whenever you have a change it's very important to evaluate where you're coming from and was that"
"13723690","13727830"," you know sort of i mean if we were in a happy equilibrium and always well with the world uh"
"13727830","13733350"," and then only seven stocks rally then i would worry about it but i mean if you look at last"
"13733350","13739870"," year you know that's where the sell-off was so why would one expect everybody else to rally when"
"13739870","13745470"," they didn't really fall that much uh so that's the first point the second point i would make is"
"13745470","13753410"," that we are you know so we caught the big move up in january uh we then you know it"
"13753410","13760990"," moved into sort of the fundamental turnaround in their earnings which was taking place uh a by june"
"13760990","13766730"," we went neutral megacap and growth megacap growth in tech because while we're very very"
"13766730","13772270"," constructive on their earnings and their fundamentals on a relative basis we think there's just too"
"13772270","13777990"," much priced in basically and that's where you still are now exactly and so we're really looking for"
"13777990","13784510"," the rally to broaden i wouldn't be short them because they do grow their earnings a lot faster than"
"13784510","13788810"," everybody else does but we are looking for the rally to broaden so i would look elsewhere for now"
"13788810","13794450"," but in neutral and megacap growth in tech fascinating 5100 base case 5500 in the bullish case and"
"13794450","13798650"," real quickly what gets us to the bullish case what would be it's just a very it's the macro"
"13798650","13804830"," consensus giving up on the recession basically uh at a better macro growth outlook the bullish case"
"13804830","13811090"," is actually if we have two and a half percent GDP growth in the u.s we've had more than"
"13811090","13816670"," that for the last five quarters so i would argue it's a very reasonable alternative to consider"
"13816670","13821810"," incredible turn of events one of the few people who kind of had the right position in coming into"
"13821810","13826770"," it binky thanks for joining us today good to check in with you binky chatta from Deutsche Bank well"
"13826770","13831530"," let's go from the glass half full view to the more pessimistic take on the economy we did get"
"13831530","13836470"," strong data this morning retail sales unexpectedly rose in november new jobless claims were down by"
"13836470","13841790"," 19 000 but double lines jeff gunlock did warn the good news won't keep up forever here's what he"
"13841790","13848450"," said on cmbc yesterday we've broken down below the trend line on the 10-year treasury yield that"
"13848450","13854830"," goes back a couple of years and there's a lot of room below it i would guess that we will"
"13854830","13860170"," see the 10-year treasury yield in the low threes sometime next year and that would be consistent in"
"13860170","13867370"," my view only with the fed cutting more like i don't know 200 basis points or even more next year"
"13867370","13872710"," so i i think we're looking for recession next year we've been talking about this the market seems"
"13872710","13878490"," to be picking up on that well on that note let's pick up with david rosenberg he's the founder and"
"13878490","13883030"," president at rosenberg research joining us on the phone line today david it's good to see i don't"
"13883030","13887170"," know if you caught our discussion just now with binky chatta but he makes a pretty compelling case"
"13887170","13893890"," for why we're going to dodge the downturn this time around at least for the time being well kelly"
"13893890","13902330"," thanks for having me on i don't know why anybody would think that we've necessarily dodged the"
"13902330","13912030"," downturn the last thing i would do is extrapolate uh 2023 to 2024 and that is people like"
"13912030","13920510"," him that were extrapolating 2007 and 2008 and got their head sliced off or extrapolating 2000 and"
"13920510","13928370"," 2001 getting the head sliced off extrapolating 1989 into 1990 getting the head sliced off we've"
"13928370","13933770"," been on a soft landing for at least a year but the soft landing is just that transition phase of"
"13933770","13940230"," the business cycle that the bridge from the expansion phase to the contraction phase which will be"
"13940230","13949130"," next to your story and i believe that is why all the said talked about at the 2b meeting and"
"13949130","13956130"," the only thing we talked about was how far and how fast will we be cutting rates in the next"
"13956130","13963690"," two years the stock market is only looking at wow rates are going to come down without thinking"
"13963690","13970950"," about why is it that rates are going to be coming down and what struck me in the fed stop"
"13970950","13980010"," box on the economy is that they're calling for 3.8 nominal 2b people next year 3.8 nominal"
"13980010","13987090"," i actually think it's going to be closer to 3 percent but that's their forecast and so the stock"
"13987090","13991970"," market price for a double-digit earnings growth next year and that's not going to happen if the"
"13991970","13998530"," fed's right on nominal 2b teams so they both can't be right so i think that we have to ask"
"13998530","14005850"," yourself why is the fed at least verbally pivoting so dramatically they're seeing something right"
"14005850","14009950"," now that i think a lot of folks in the market place aren't they or maybe they're seeing what we're"
"14009950","14014770"," all seeing which is receiving inflation and that's the best you know thing to react to because you"
"14014770","14019710"," don't have to worry about the worsening data you can just react to that that breathing room right i"
"14019710","14026030"," mean what would you say quick last question here is is the lesson the takeaway from 2023 a year in"
"14026030","14030590"," which it looked like we were going to tip into recession at any moment and we continued to be"
"14030590","14038530"," surprised by the fact that it didn't show up right and what i'm trying to say is that 2023 when"
"14038530","14045030"," you were asking your previous guess what does it look like 2023 looks like 2007 so all it was was"
"14045030","14050190"," the bridge i think the people that were coming to fist on the table uh the recession starting this"
"14050190","14054990"," year uh we're just too early but let me just say this so then oh yeah after what we tell"
"14054990","14061050"," sales uh there'll be we're visiting with that number as you saw it up in the October and it's a"
"14061050","14066330"," very small sample size in the first go around here so we know kelly we know that the fed is"
"14066330","14072330"," listening more right now to their business contacts around the country than they are to be spurious"
"14072330","14078630"," and offer wise economic data that's coming out of the blf and other government sources and when you"
"14078630","14083650"," go to the base book that came out of November 29th what did they say right he said the two "
"14083650","14091170","-thirds of the country is either stagnating or contracting right now so for a we know the reception"
"14091170","14097050"," is already starting it's not in the data but it's in the anecdotal information that business"
"14097050","14103290"," contacts not government statisticians they're telling the fed right now so when we do the interview"
"14103290","14107410"," i say two three months from now i get a sense that the conversation is going to be a little"

"14886640","14890700"," but if you get trapped and we start swinging high you're gonna get in trouble so this initial"

"14949240","14954380"," massive uh sorry for my uh my nose to which uh triggered a massive short squeeze uh short basket up"
"14954380","14960500"," 6.6 percent and propelled the gamma imbalanced to a new record high on the other hand realized the"
"14960500","14965780"," vol continues to be in free fall mode uh due to said gamma imbalanced with which is a vol"
"14965780","14972100"," suppressor enforces vol control strategies back into the market we model that this community has um"
"14972100","14978900"," increased its its exposure uh by 50 billion since mid-November could add another 10 billion uh"
"14978900","14985960"," until opex leads to a gamma unclenching that could uh potentially increase vol again"
"14985960","14994400"," we estimate that all sequel or record gamma amount of 7 718 million will expire and friday c below"
"14994400","15001240"," which will pump some volatility back into the markets yep oh this will likely be a lot yeah yeah"
"15001240","15008380"," okay so i guess this is maybe maybe in some expectation into friday i guess what i'm reading here"
"15008380","15013940"," for some volatility with some true volatility from inside the market let me find out where the uh"
"15013940","15023030"," where the gamma flip is here give me a second gamma flip is 45 90"
"15023030","15032810"," so yeah"
"15032810","15039370"," right in here so your gamma flip is right below here so right where that hourly trigger is shocker"
"15039370","15049300"," right so your gamma flip is roughly right here"
"15051180","15056760"," so this is going to be like a pivotal you know pivotal pivotal pivotal place down here uh if we"
"15056760","15062060"," can get underneath this if you're a bear that's really where you want to be otherwise dealers are"
"15062060","15070520"," still kind of uh weakens as we end of friday but kind of forced into buying these dips here so"
"15070520","15084090"," just be aware of that down here i think that's the basic just that"

"15103020","15108100"," get the rejection to get what i'm saying you need to see this or even see a squeeze higher than"
"15108100","15113300"," the half hour and then it rejects straight down you need to be watching the demand from buyers here"
"15113300","15120740"," and the aggressiveness of sellers underneath this gamma flip zone right here now if you get"
"15120740","15128560"," underneath this stuff here right we will trade four six five zero and most definitely forty uh six"
"15128560","15147550"," hundred could be back on board again as true support that is the largest gamma that we have here"

"16750419","16755860"," balanced dual objective of bias than worry about the real economy and i think one reason for that"
"16755860","16760140"," is because the fed is always laser focused on what's happening at the real interest rate and"

"16892680","16896520"," percent you call it three and a half if you want is that still a cost of capital that you"
"16896520","16901060"," think companies will be comfortable with or choke on but they're going to feel a lot more"
"16901060","16906960"," comfortable about four than they are about five but by our estimation you know look we started"
"16906960","16912500"," basically year zero at one point in time we're half percent on the ten year we're now adjusting to"
"16912500","16917520"," an environment of three and a half percent plus uh we think kind of fair value on short term is"
"16917520","16921300"," somewhere in the three three and a half range fair value on longer term like ten years is somewhere"
"16921300","16927020"," around four uh this is a big difference and economies haven't really becoming hasn't really made a"
"16927020","16932160"," way to filter it through we're still sitting on a lot of debt at lower rates that's going to be"

"16943820","16948900"," but bill i guess there was a lot of pent up demand or that that the idea that the fed"
"16948900","16954520"," could hike again which now looks to be off the table was something that held back uh investment in"
"16954520","16958980"," the equity market there were a lot of people bill who were pretty happy for a few minutes there"
"16958980","16964560"," that were clipping treasury coupons and collecting four or five percent in money market funds maybe"

"16968540","16974320"," treasuries i mean i guess as a risk asset if you were trying to make uh quick money it was"
"16974320","16979220"," a good thing but maybe for the long term it's a different story well as you see what's happening in"
"16979220","16983260"," the market today there's a lot of portfolio readjustment right and people are saying wow i got to"
"16983260","16987480"," do something with my money rather than sitting back and clipping coupons and i think that's was fed"
"16987480","16992120"," a lot of that market rally but now you see the market itself is rotating is rotating from one"
"16992120","16997520"," sector to another all that that magnificent seven uh surge that we had has now been brought into"

"17002320","17005720"," you know the fed is really concerned with what's happening through the big picture and the big"
"17005720","17011280"," picture right now is that the the companies that that we were just talking about were worried about"
"17011280","17015780"," financing are they going to choke on this high cost of capital well if the expecting inflation rate"
"17015780","17020320"," is still slightly above two percent and the pricing in the bond market shows that it's around two"
"17020320","17025920"," and two and a quarter percent then at three and a half to four percent uh long term interest rates"
"17025920","17031760"," that's a good number for them to start to do financing with one of the things that the place that"
"17031760","17036600"," we will choke on these high rates would be the government because the government has to pay a very"

"17056360","17062580"," i'm just wondering how you're thinking about portfolios differently today my take was that Powell"

"17066940","17072680"," time that time has gone away and i'm wondering if you think there are things in adjustments people"

"17078820","17084220"," we quite often try to keep our bat on the shoulder in terms of portfolios quite often that doesn't"
"17084220","17089080"," make sense to to make big shifts but then sometimes the markets present you with opportunities to"
"17089080","17093640"," do a little bit more uh and this is one of those where it just feels like the market's gotten"
"17093640","17097840"," a little bit ahead of itself uh and even if you're even if you're looking at your portfolio back in"
"17097840","17103080"," time here if you're positioned well about say three months ago and you look to your portfolio today"
"17103080","17108400"," the likelihood is it is not positioned the way you want it to be today because of the magnitude of"
"17108400","17112800"," movement so that provides opportunity to bring it back in line and that from our perspective is"
"17112800","17117460"," getting a little bit more concerned than portfolios in recognition that the market seems to be just"
"17117460","17122700"," a hair ahead of itself at the minimum quick question i don't really do strategy Jason involved"
"17122700","17129740"," bonds but what do you do after this move well bonds five percent i think bonds were a fairly good"
"17129740","17133700"," deal at that point in time we're actually saying that unlike the equity market there was overvalued"
"17133700","17138660"," bonds were actually undervalued at four percent we think they're actually reasonably fairly valued"
"17138660","17143420"," we've been pushing out a little bit on the yield curve we've kind of paused that a little bit and"
"17143420","17147660"," are sitting with a pretty neutral duration exposure right now because we think bonds properly"
"17147660","17152620"," reflect the expectations for interest rates that are sitting out there now when those expectations"
"17152620","17158440"," change that math will change but for right now they're basically in line with fair value bill real"
"17158440","17164080"," quick we have to go when does the fed cut and by how much next year if the market continues"
"17164080","17168420"," the lower long-term rates if they can delay and i'm guessing they'll delay in total somewhere"
"17168420","17173140"," around the year when they can actually do a large cut and be done with it before the elections and"
"17173140","17179540"," how much next year i'm guessing they have the lower rates by about a percentage point wow thanks"
"17179540","17184620"," guys jason pride and billy that's how you can just trading sessions we've had the last couple of"

"17232340","17239320"," eastern what we saw was a drop of significantly larger proportions on the short maturity two-year"
"17239320","17245940"," versus the ten-year so you dropped about 30 basis points on a two-year drop about 23 basis points"
"17245940","17252520"," on a 10 why is that important because if the short maturities are leading the way the blast guest"
"17252520","17257580"," said he believes that the ten-year yield to be closer to four or four and a quarter percent that"

"17294460","17299680"," what's going on there's a lot of fomo and a lot of things have to work out picture perfect with"

"17329040","17334320"," today there's short duration relative to the index which if you want to translate that into english"
"17334320","17339360"," it means they didn't own enough ten year twenty or thirty year paper is that still the case rick"

"17350250","17357150"," more gains to come on the long end of the curve you know i i think you're you're right on"
"17357150","17362030"," it i think an easier way to look at it is the yield curve twos to ten right and many"

"18867400","18871560"," it's kind of a shitty term isn't it well it's not a shake term i think two things i think"
"18871560","18879700"," saying window of weakness uh means one thing right there's the there's a window for this to happen"
"18879700","18883800"," but i think a lot of people jump on it and say hey we're going to crash because of the"
"18883800","18890800"," window of weakness or they don't um they pin or associate a window of weakness with confirmed"
"18890800","18896420"," definite downside kind of i don't you know it's a good word it's or it's a good use of words"
"18896420","18909770"," but it gets it gets manipulated right now there's a manipulation going on or a"
"18909770","18919760"," manipulation of that word yeah we so Dilobar said it"
"18919760","18923720"," already has to happen exactly in that time frame i agree with that one too at Dilobar does matter"
"18923720","18931060"," of fact the uh dates for the dates for the past three or four weeks now uh have been front"
"18931060","18935860"," run right we're like front running everything by a day everybody knows so it's like front run this"

"19013300","19020160"," in iwm i made a post on fin twent three four weeks ago uh i laid out the entire iwm"
"19020160","19030000"," plan iwm plan uh the thesis here is in and around december 15th is your next opportunity in that"
"19030000","19036040"," post about three four weeks ago i highlighted all of this okay um right around i shouldn't say"
"19036040","19042460"," right so based or not right around basically on december 15th uh in terms of trading days you're"
"19042460","19052260"," supposed to be looking for a low on iwm and you long it into march not january um and that"
"19052260","19057400"," now if you're longing into march you probably even some of you probably want to be taking uh calls"
"19057400","19065500"," that are dated let's say for uh april may june july but closing them in march or put spreads that"
"19065500","19074200"," are dated a week or two out into april uh for iwm now there's a caveat to this statement here"
"19074200","19080300"," okay that needs to be addressed you've got you also have a couple things that i want you to be"
"19080300","19087680"," thinking about i don't care what anybody says out there okay there is a tractor beam on the end of"
"19087680","19096420"," month for 45 one five on spy okay that doesn't necessarily impact iwm where you buy iwm just be"
"19096420","19100980"," aware of it now i don't care if we're above the magnets at 45 one five or if we're trading"
"19100980","19107960"," below the magnet at 45 one five but the closer we get to the 31st spoos is going to want"
"19107960","19116740"," to go there another thing to note here too is because of what happened with durham powell um iwm"
"19116740","19124740"," should outperform the greater market okay because of what happened yesterday basically uh iwm"
"19124740","19131920"," should outperform now you will see out performance by small and mid cap tech stocks um you might"
"19131920","19140220"," even see uh big tech do well but the key point or driver here is sop 500 and the cues"
"19140220","19148800"," should under perform iwm coming into march at least like you'll still see good performance but not"
"19148800","19158920"," not even near what iwm should do and iwm exposes you to those small cap mid cap small cap risk"
"19158920","19167800"," on risk on spec growth tickers that you're looking for now you can find other indexes to trade this"
"19167800","19174240"," uh but iwm seems it's got great liquidity you're not uh you've got or you should have i don't have"
"19174240","19180660"," scott's shitty liquidity but they'll have better liquidity than some of the smaller indexes that"
"19180660","19186360"," are out there and you might only be able to buy those indexes not even trade options on them so"
"19186360","19196250"," in around the uh 15th okay on the on the iwm trade for march am"
"19196250","19204310"," i saying that the moass on jimmy starts soon that's a tough one um i'm watching gme for that i'm"

"19257130","19261190"," potential to boom up into the end of the year you can actually you've seen that happening the past"
"19261190","19265010"," few weeks a bunch of tickers have been talking about all year long that have been moving just like"
"19265010","19270790"," marching up there they're blasting them to new highs right now into end of the year and then a"
"19270790","19276130"," rotation into some of this stuff into the beginning of the year uh with the ad or the implication"
"19276130","19282350"," of tax cuts or excuse me of rate cuts coming in 2024 now there's a caveat to all of this"
"19282350","19290730"," uh and this march projection is where are we uh in the in the timing of all of this like"
"19290730","19299610"," are we timing this back into end of july right for timing when we actually get rate cuts or is"
"19299610","19306450"," it from this point forward uh and when do you expect those rate cuts no no one's gonna want to"
"19306450","19310070"," tell you this okay but i'm gonna tell you the truth i'm just gonna piss off a lot of bulls"
"19310070","19318250"," okay now price will matter on this but there should be a front running no matter where price is i"
"19318250","19323490"," don't care if price is at five thousand or price is at forty five hundred i don't care where price"
"19323490","19332190"," is but i want you to know that regardless of where price is banks are going to attempt a front"
"19332190","19342090"," running of rate cuts so you should be keeping your eyes on uh the rate of inflation uh"
"19342090","19347490"," you should be keeping your eyes on the unemployment rate and be thinking about when the fed will"
"19347490","19355970"," actually cut um roughly one to three months before that you will see banks attempt to uh front run"
"19355970","19362870"," uh that's uh eventual cuts and begin to dump the market so let's say we're at five thousand right"
"19362870","19368930"," they would dump at five thousand and we might blast down to forty eight hundred or forty six"
"19368930","19374670"," hundred right if we're at forty five hundred we could blast down to say thirty eight hundred or"
"19374670","19381370"," even thirty six hundred uh when that uh eventuality comes to bear fruit okay so it is going to"
"19381370","19387330"," matter of prices uh but you have to think about that as well uh when you're trading this iWM trade"
"19387330","19395030"," uh or this possibility of iWM outperforming do they cut it short is it January and not March that's"
"19395030","19401050"," the big question right you actually get that uh that that effect on iWM of eventual rate cuts all"
"19401050","19410630"," the way into March or do we end up getting um a subdued version of that um into March"
"19413350","19422910"," isn't rate cuts bullish uh that's uh that's a complicated uh that's a loaded question um"
"19423810","19432830"," to predict historically no they are not uh or no they are not for where we are so uh here"
"19432830","19441170"," let me draw this out pretty really quick so our our rate cuts bullish ready positive rates right"
"19441170","19448290"," here market this is the market positive rates right um let's say this is the market right here"
"19448290","19453870"," right we're pausing we're pausing normal pullbacks pausing pausing pausing right this is let me"
"19453870","19457590"," bring this let me shit to hold on a second here you bring this over so you can actually see"
"19457590","19468130"," it give a second here so this right here is uh the rates okay they're steady this"
"19468130","19473910"," is the market over here right and it's just grinding like higher higher pullback higher higher"
"19473910","19481450"," pullback right let's say this is in the future and you have rates cuts right about one to three"
"19481450","19490410"," months before those rate cuts you'll see the market usually bloodbath okay and it will chase this"
"19490410","19496450"," and you'll be like why is this happening oh god why is this happening and you'll see the event the"
"19496450","19506030"," eventual rate cut somewhere in here right and the rate cuts will chase price down does that make"
"19506030","19513210"," sense and you won't get the bounce up until afterwards so you're like we're like right here this is"
"19513210","19517130"," where we are right now okay so you're like yeah fuck yeah everything's awesome everything's awesome"
"19517130","19523030"," you're looking for uh this one to three month range for this roll down now this pricing could be"
"19523030","19530430"," five thousand could be 450 uh 4500 it doesn't matter where it is um but you want to be aware"
"19530430","19537830"," of this okay so when someone says rate cuts are bullish fuck yeah they're bullish but they're"
"19537830","19544110"," bullish but they're bullish you know as like yes they're bullish but that's because we're trying to"

"19549150","19557870"," people misconstrued what that statement means uh this always happens always every time every single"
"19557870","19566530"," time now um what you think is pain on that trade what you think is pain on that trade uh"
"19566530","19573850"," is or matter or price will matter what the pain on that trade is i should say does it make"
"19573850","19585110"," sense to you guys or no let me know if that makes sense or not now and"
"19585110","19592970"," you have to think about that into next year that's not really a today thing that's you know that's"
"19592970","19596670"," not really a today issue that like but you have to think about it think about it when you're"

"19738250","19745130"," missed out on all those underlying gains and he was on the wrong side of the trade going up right"

"21043350","21048430"," this again i'll heart back on this again so we're in a place right now where um we've accomplished"
"21048430","21055990"," what we set out to do and we're at a maturity in that like so we've like matured into hey"
"21055990","21060610"," did we do what we set out to do and we did and we're at a place here where the"
"21060610","21067890"," question becomes do we want to make this sustainable and grow uh and if that is the case we have"
"21067890","21076610"," to offer some type of mon some type of a monetized um uh greater benefit to our members and we"
"21076610","21080950"," have a demand for that or the people are saying that they want that so if we can provide that"
"21080950","21086770"," to people that want to pay uh and if that helps us to keep doing what we're doing that's what"
"21086770","21093590"," we'll do uh and if it doesn't work we'll just close it down that's very simple um so this next"
"21093590","21102590"," step the my the grand vision for myself um for this next step is that it becomes uh self uh"
"21102590","21109510"," like it takes care of itself i can keep the people that we've attracted over the years uh invested"
"21109510","21113950"," in what we're doing like i want to keep a david ams around i want to keep a john l"
"21113950","21120370"," here i want to keep um blind nest owl here i want to keep uh joe donut here and quin"
"21120370","21127470"," here and uh binky is breaks his dick in day in day out uh one in the do a sunday"
"21127470","21131550"," stock show right i've got other we've got other people great traders out there that want to get"
"21131550","21136630"," involved with what we're doing um we got vol uh vol control of all signals i want to talk to"
"21136630","21140870"," that guy when you're trying to in that there's some other stuff here too that i haven't discussed"
"21140870","21147910"," with you but we're trying to do a network as well for uh uh traders that want an outlet for"
"21147910","21152710"," an easy street outlet for them to get their stuff out to other people there's like i'll trade the"
"21152710","21158850"," track trigger network but uh uh they were trying to work on right now but the idea being here or"
"21158850","21163870"," the idea with this is that if we can take care of those people and keep them focused and staying"
"21163870","21170790"," with us and not just disappearing uh this will continue to uh become a more sustained community you"
"21170790","21175770"," know one of the things that's set but that i'm scared of i've had like a fear right now uh"
"21175770","21181050"," it's that you know there's um you know like people that want everything free i'm fine with people"
"21181050","21185210"," that want everything free uh i get no like ill will towards somebody that wants something for free"
"21185210","21191070"," but i got to say this um you know there's people that want everything for free no matter what and"
"21191070","21201010"," if where they're getting that free stuff uh remains um unsustainable there's that there's a a"
"21201010","21207850"," finite time frame where you can't do that anymore and so we shut it down right well that person"
"21207850","21212550"," that only wants free they disappear and they go find the next free thing okay so it's not like a"
"21212550","21217390"," much better like tuck down or bad about someone that wants something for free so the only"
"21217390","21223050"," conclusion that i can find to that um and people that want to keep continue to see it uh keep"
"21223050","21226750"," going are going to be like what the fuck man like why just shut it all down so the only"
"21226750","21232490"," sustainable solution i find here is that uh people that want a more enriched experience that are"
"21232490","21237550"," willing to support that uh if they pay for that to happen it only benefits the person that's"
"21237550","21242130"," looking for free so if you're someone that wants this free um you know look towards people that"
"21242130","21247230"," want to see this grow and uh and they will and they're going to actually provide you with the still"
"21247230","21254740"," with that free experience um so that's what that's where we're at right now you know i don't know"
"21254740","21259700"," how to explain it so uh and then hold some other mechanics too this mechanics behind is their value"
"21259700","21265680"," and what we do when it's free this human psychology is to discount its value there's a bunch of"
"21265680","21276570"," other crap um behind this yeah uh"
"21276570","21284770"," so i gave beta i or we released beta testing for people and i had to move i had to"
"21284770","21290410"," do some shit to the tool and move it and so i had a boy i ended up deleting everybody's"

"21313430","21320550"," the other side of things it does mean that people are using this stuff in their day-to-day trading"
"21320550","21325190"," uh they want they want they want they want that's okay i want this and i don't want i feel"

"22120180","22126000"," month where those levels uh you might be like hey why didn't that level hold or why did we break"
"22126000","22131460"," through that level and there's other mechanics in the background uh that are taking place okay it's"
"22131460","22137900"," the same thing as um when we couldn't remember we couldn't break through 4600 we needed tall side"
"22137900","22145700"," development to the upside at that point we needed like 4700 to open up 4650 we needed uh 4750 and"

"22227590","22233450"," do that did we we said fuck you boom right i guess we did it but then what else did"
"22233450","22238390"," we do rip up and slam into that green bar again right so we kind of did it not exact"
"22238390","22244250"," but pretty close and see it right there right came right i said now we're going to go up right"
"22244250","22249510"," we did one little bloodbath down slammed up there right came back well we didn't slam up there i"
"22249510","22256310"," guess we uh let's say we slammed up there came back down right here and then we had that nice"
"22256310","22264230"," squeeze up and got above right did it sooner than later over here we already did it what's next for"
"22264230","22270530"," tesla bull let's look at it let's take a look let's go to a domain trigger screen here all right"

"22316850","22322370"," going to tell you if you're not already long they're going to say to you uh we're going to the"
"22322370","22327530"," moon we're going to the moon we're going up here why because they just want to get out they just"
"22327530","22334430"," want to exit over here and what they own what these people do is they wind up buying tops all"
"22334430","22338950"," the time that's what they do they buy tops they're top buyers so that what happens is they get"
"22338950","22344250"," caught here right they get bloodbath i'm going to talk talk the cycle to you uh they're doom and"
"22344250","22348150"," gloomers but they're still holding they're still holding down here they didn't didn't get squeezed"
"22348150","22352990"," out down below right there they made it through the pain and now we come up here and they go"
"22352990","22359750"," oh fuck yes you know i didn't thank god i didn't sell right so we come up here and say"
"22359750","22366530"," start telling their friends they're like oh dude we're going to the moon bro but in reality as we"
"22366530","22373690"," come up here guess what they do they fucking sell right there and then they go i'm just going to"
"22373690","22379810"," stay out of the market i learned my lesson from over there i'm going to wait to buy you don't"
"22379810","22384730"," realize that when you're up here right while that guy's talking to you now that guy that was"
"22384730","22389550"," talking to you before he gets what he does now he's sitting on the sidelines he's watching all this"
"22389550","22394450"," action guess what he does we squeeze up here or we actually we squeeze up here then up there he's"
"22394450","22400790"," actually up here fucking buying again and then he goes to the entire cycle one more time so that's"
"22400790","22405350"," what's happening right now you've got people selling into you you've got that uh you of course you"
"22405350","22410250"," get funds and all that selling into then you also have trap buyers selling into so what do you need"
"22410250","22415530"," to do you need to need to wear out all of these sellers that were trapped here these aren't"
"22415530","22419870"," actually bears these are probably bulls or you have bears but then you have bulls doing it too"
"22419870","22427410"," right uh so until we break through these previous sellers here uh you should we should be doing"
"22427410","22434290"," this but this is all positive this is all very positive it's all very positive for more upside to"
"22434290","22442070"," come so what i would like to see what i would like to see is let's take a look back"
"22442070","22450800"," here right there right we're going to draw another one right here"

"22475700","22488530"," right there right 300 you might"
"22488530","22495470"," be asking why am i drawing these in it's because how much volatility do we actually have above us"
"22495470","22501250"," right we have these yellow bars all together or is it just one or two bars and then this bad"
"22501250","22505430"," this is this is the squeeze right here by the way just so you know it's a big old fat"
"22505430","22515650"," squeeze in here right there that one's red okay right"

"22607170","22613490"," whenever i see um whenever i see like minus 50 minus 25 minus 50 on tesla it's time to buy"
