"662220","663200"," Never came back."
"675750","681770"," Yeah, well, yesterday we were talking about it briefly, the whole work from home culture and the"
"681770","685890"," drum beat to get back into the office, right?"
"686190","687650"," And, you know, what are the reasons for that?"
"688310","689710"," This previous little Friday, I think."

"795310","796030"," I don't know. "
"796090","799150"," Part of it is that he's alone or he was alone during COVID."
"801010","802650"," He would actually go into the office."
"802890","804870"," I could not even when he sent people home. "
"809800","810760"," But I work from home."
"811060","816200"," I don't understand the economics of wanting to be in the office if it's not required."
"817260","818740"," I could see it in sales, I guess. "
"826370","827890"," Minus serious spot five percent."

"995840","999300"," You're saying as a leader, it's difficult to form relationships with your team remotely."
"1000260","1001020"," I agree with that. "
"1001640","1004040"," I know some sales guys that say the same thing."
"1006150","1007570"," I think it depends on what you do."
"1008250","1015370"," My wife, you know, has appointments with clients and stuff and patients and so it's easy for her. "
"1015370","1025339"," But yeah, I think it has a lot"

"1917250","1919210"," Butch cross the daily in just a moment. "
"1934570","1939090"," Yeah, Vicks trading 17, 52, and there's a previous."
"1939750","1941890"," It was 20 we were looking at yesterday."
"1943290","1947030"," The next target for Vicks is 18, 13, and 18, 41. "
"1962700","1965780"," 432Ps for the 11th are on life support right now."
"1965800","1967180"," They're at 28 cents."
"1969300","1972420"," Even down here, 445s are not helping me at all. "
"1984140","1986620"," HYG is still not looking good here, still limping."
"1986760","1990500"," Actually, HYG is setting up a bear cross right now."
"1994890","1996350"," Dixie breaking out right now. "
"2003310","2004330"," Apple with a bounce."
"2032360","2036380"," Heads bark and saying there is still competing outlook for the economy."
"2036960","2040700"," One where inflation will glide down to 2% and another where it remains persistent. "
"2041740","2044640"," There was also the talking heads out this morning talking about inflation."
"2046100","2047560"," And that was a big topic."
"2049060","2051860"," How low do they need to get at the target at 2%. "
"2051860","2059219"," There's some people arguing that zero is enough to not need to get above the rate of inflation."
"2066949","2070770"," There were some comments this morning as well of a pause to be expected."
"2096400","2097960"," Man, I don't want to buy puts here. "
"2098100","2099860"," I don't want anything to do with this right now."
"2101160","2102760"," I don't want to get squeezed out."
"2130830","2131670"," Dixie bullish. "
"2133850","2135490"," We're going to get a bloodbath here."
"2135890","2136130"," Definitely."
"2138050","2139710"," Definitely going to get a bloodbath here. "
"2211540","2213340"," Yields have a little bit more to go this morning too."
"2214200","2215740"," I'm looking at yields this morning."
"2259140","2262160"," I saw the TLT push up last night. "
"2279520","2281460"," I'm watching TLT in the background too."
"2290960","2308800"," Let's see if there's a buy on 96.54. Yesterday,"
"2308840","2312980"," Paunter slides as AI fails to deliver strong sales outlook."
"2314620","2315380"," The PLTR. "
"2317860","2320100"," Disney reports after the bell tomorrow."
"2321040","2322580"," We got Moody's."
"2323260","2323660"," Downgrades. "
"2325820","2327680"," Lots of talk this morning about inflation."
"2347780","2349040"," I like that this morning."
"2349280","2351780"," Yesterday, I was looking at the market. "
"2352820","2356960"," I'm like, man, the only sector that's not down right now is banks."
"2357820","2359220"," It's the last one holding up."
"2359340","2360500"," I'm not too concerned right now. "
"2360980","2363000"," Overnight BAM downgrade."
"2365440","2367860"," I'm like, this is not perfect timing."
"2370360","2372660"," It's the only sector that was still holding up. "
"2375240","2377860"," Yesterday, we looked at it yesterday, right on the show."
"2378120","2381520"," It's like, the only sector right now is still cranking is banks."
"2382700","2384800"," First thing this morning, downgrades. "
"2386600","2387620"," Let's clip some banks."
"2387920","2389440"," Let's take some problem with the banks."
"2389960","2390880"," I was like, okay, here we go. "
"2397460","2398320"," No, I can't."
"2398340","2399320"," I haven't found an entry on puts."
"2399540","2402460"," I missed this one right here. "
"2402460","2407380"," So unless we start to retest this stuff above, no trade for me."
"2407680","2408980"," But tech looks pretty weak."
"2409980","2411460"," Get a little box right here to enter. "
"2412760","2413860"," Another one above it."
"2416590","2417790"," How do we get caught in a squeeze?"
"2418110","2423230"," So if we squeeze, I'll jump in another round here."
"2429680","2432200"," The tech looks like it's in a death's file right now. "
"2433020","2434720"," Tech is cooling off."
"2435460","2436760"," So we'll see what happens."
"2437800","2440220"," I want to see 15 zero eight zero. "
"2440280","2442600"," I don't know if we're going to see it or not, but I'd like to see it."
"2443140","2445480"," Down here at S three, crack a dawn."
"2449620","2452400"," 10 30 in the morning already blasting through S three. "
"2454680","2457320"," How previous lows back here, up here and here."
"2457380","2458780"," We want to tag this at some point."
"2476770","2478330"," Yeah, did you see that yesterday with banks?"
"2478570","2482770"," We were looking at the market breadth and we were like, that's the only, like, financials look"
"2482770","2483510"," great right now. "
"2485730","2489050"," They're like, oh, we got to, they're like, we had to come out tomorrow and cut the banks."
"2491830","2493130"," We got to dump this market."
"2493470","2495990"," Yeah, it makes me wonder like who's actually short. "
"2496670","2501350"," There aren't too many like, like the S and P 500 is owned by like what?"
"2502110","2503130"," Three, four entities."
"2504090","2506170"," And those are the guys that are making the rounds this week."
"2510050","2512570"," It's like all the doom and bloom posting. "
"2512570","2517850"," I'm like, yeah, it's probably, probably a few, few characters selling the market."
"2518510","2520950"," Six or I think they used to say there was seven of them."
"2521310","2522410"," I think there's six now. "
"2523390","2537040"," If we"
"2537040","2538480"," can get up here, I might take some puts."
"2538720","2539700"," We can get up to this area here."
"2541960","2543620"," A little bit of a bounce on Nasdaq. "
"2546880","2549460"," You know, it's these kind of things right here where I'm like."
"2551100","2553040"," So I'm looking at a NDX right now."
"2553520","2557700"," And I'm like, yeah, you could say that NDX closed the gap here. "
"2559660","2561060"," You know, it goes though, right?"
"2561260","2566020"," You get like that first bounce and then it rolls one or two more times."
"2568880","2580300"," There's a stink bit down there and you"
"2580300","2581720"," got some water rungs here."
"2590660","2592320"," It's kind of fascinating. "
"2593600","2599280"," I was just watching Bloomberg from New York and they had the guys on from the guy that they had"
"2599280","2603400"," on was from, he was actually one of Moody's guys."
"2604600","2609460"," So it's like the rolled out state street earlier last week or late last week."
"2609840","2612600"," Now they're rolling out the guys from Moody's. "
"2612720","2613760"," Now I'm like, oh, what are we getting?"
"2614000","2615840"," What is it the standard and poorest turn?"
"2620370","2621190"," No, no, no, no."
"2621570","2624170"," Last week, you know, last week, last week."
"2624330","2631730"," So you're mixing up an article that I just read to you about state streets this morning as Moody's. "
"2640950","2644250"," Yesterday, we're talking about XLF, the sector."
"2644250","2678970"," Dixie is"
"2678970","2680110"," still pumping right now."
"2680470","2682250"," Tech getting hammered over it. "
"2682850","2683670"," Vic's still cracking."
"2683930","2685750"," Vic's just came into 1813."
"2686570","2688930"," That's that first little zone of resistance. "
"2691880","2711420"," Also have 1841 and then above that, I've got $20.79. Now"
"2711420","2715540"," 130,000 puts on 446 P."
"2724150","2728610"," 444s or 41 cents, 70 cents on 445."
"2731370","2732610"," No, it's such a dog show."
"2732790","2737950"," I'm going to buy him like 68 cents to buy puts to go down to here. "
"2738670","2739870"," I don't know."
"2740410","2741870"," I don't know if I want to do it."
"2754620","2755040"," Yeah, dude. "
"2755180","2757560"," Bob came on it like 130 in the morning last night."
"2758160","2760380"," He was like, we're selling this right here."
"2760920","2761980"," I was like, oh, fuck. "
"2762000","2764640"," And then the Euro sold it to and I'm like, that's it."
"2765920","2767620"," The market is going down."
"2796650","2799650"," Nasdaq just holding right now at 15, 191. "
"2801770","2804250"," Gap's still not closed yet on Nasdaq."
"2811540","2815120"," Yeah, I'm hoping I can get a test here."
"2820900","2822260"," Wouldn't mind buying some puts up here. "
"2822360","2823360"," I don't want to chase this down."
"2823940","2825620"," I probably should, but I don't want to."
"2826180","2830280"," I don't want to get blasted up here and eat like 60 cents on some puts. "
"2831140","2832460"," 70 cents on puts."
"2834790","2836670"," It'll be a painful lesson right there."
"2836670","2838070"," I lose a couple of K just right there. "
"2838210","2842850"," So no interest in them right now."
"2877680","2879820"," Harley's racing down here right now."
"2932420","2935940"," Yeah, I think we're just waiting on Nasdaq here to keep going down. "
"2974290","2977310"," Yeah, Vicki, you nailed the UPS call, man."
"2978090","2981710"," You and I were talking on the phone about UPS just the other day, right?"
"2987590","2991130"," I didn't want to say any of that stuff about UPS yesterday in the stream."
"2991750","2993870"," I was like, I don't know if I should say anything about stuff. "
"2993870","2994590"," He told me."
"3026630","3027690"," What was the amount?"
"3027990","3032010"," What was the package that the union had won exactly, Vicki?"
"3032350","3035690"," Was it like $45 over five years or something like that?"
"3037490","3041910"," Then they got a pension and medical insurance or something, right?"
"3042190","3054940"," And then negotiation still flapped"
"3054940","3055480"," me right now."
"3055560","3056580"," I've got some put set up. "
"3057060","3065980"," I'd like to see at least see something up here to grab."
"3065980","3068780"," They're asking me to buy puts right here and I'm like, I'm not doing it."
"3069020","3070260"," Sorry, I'm not bag holding here. "
"3076590","3078370"," And I think we go straight down."
"3081850","3085190"," We're waiting on Nasdaq over here to figure out what it wants to do."
"3087990","3089850"," Apple's holding up just fine too right now. "
"3090670","3091450"," It's kind of sitting there."
"3099800","3101720"," I was watching TLT a few moments ago."
"3102580","3104040"," I'd like to see a small pullback. "
"3109120","3110340"," I've traded it last week."
"3114730","3116030"," It's strong right now."
"3116610","3117390"," It's pretty strong. "
"3117670","3134420"," If you're a"
"3134420","3135640"," young person, you've got no degree."
"3135980","3137280"," You'll work at UPS, right?"
"3137400","3141100"," You get $45 and five years, pretty good."
"3151400","3155580"," It does make you wonder if wages will come down or not, right?"
"3156320","3161220"," Pretty good wage if the claim is that we're going to have high inflation. "
"3162380","3165480"," Although the statement is that inflation is coming down."
"3166080","3176010"," A little bit of a turn right now in Apple, Meta, Microsoft and Google in the"
"3176010","3176830"," past hour here."
"3177470","3179930"," A little bit of a bottoming action going on in tech right now. "
"3194740","3196100"," It makes you want to buy some calls now."
"3200780","3224830"," 448.26. Long,"
"3225010","3369050"," 448 C's on there."
"3370830","3372170"," Keep on pushing. "
"3373750","3375150"," Come on there."
"3375410","3376130"," Keep on pushing."
"3381840","3383660"," Keep on pushing to the upside. "
"3387480","3390020"," Dude, give me two pennies for that green bar."
"3390160","3391260"," That is utter bullshit."
"3392180","3392560"," I'm clicking. "
"3395840","3396540"," It's killing me."
"3397520","3400040"," Another penny now, 30 cents, 31 cents."
"3441510","3443030"," Train 31, 32. "
"3455950","3457710"," We're going to roll over and fix right now."
"3458870","3465860"," Train 32 on 48, 33."
"3477740","3495920"," Have an order in above to sell 36, 34, 33,"
"3496640","3496640"," 32. "
"3509960","3511120"," I actually get more in this."
"3512080","3513960"," I get a nice big fat squeeze here."
"3518790","3520170"," Train 33 right now. "
"3530980","3532520"," I'm putting some resistance here."
"3571760","3573680"," Yeah, they're not paying the call side here."
"3577300","3581060"," Now only up, I don't know, three or four pennies right now, even on that whole push. "
"3581420","3582300"," Give me nothing for this."
"3583220","3583980"," Zero premium kick."
"3591260","3592800"," Now I'm only up one penny here. "
"3599860","3602020"," Yeah, there's no premium on the call side either."
"3602020","3606560"," This is like put, put down flat right now."
"3609990","3614170"," I bought that tick down here too, so just grind and calls out. "
"3614470","3616550"," I'm going to pull the plug here in a minute."
"3646280","3648400"," Now is that testing at 6 CMA right now."
"3651640","3653420"," VIX testing at 6 CMA. "
"3666620","3667400"," Down a penny."
"3694620","3696660"," Now is that rolling over again here."
"3704080","3708840"," The VIX hits over a two month high, lost up to spot zero two points. "
"3709160","3710740"," That's 17 spots, seven nine."
"3714330","3716530"," They have Xtrading 18, 10."
"3717870","3723040"," I think I've got 18, 13 years of tag in 18, 41. "
"3723320","3725820"," Above that is 20, 90 or 86."
"3765340","3770360"," Washington State joins California in the $5 a gallon gasoline club."
"3774830","3776370"," Five bucks a gallon. "
"3777090","3781590"," Does Washington require you to have someone pump the gas for you still or no?"
"3785570","3788530"," Fair and greed index 63 of out of 100."
"3790410","3800090"," Too low it needs to be around 75 to"
"3800090","3800490"," 100."
"3804450","3809010"," Was it wasn't like one of those states have required people pumping gas for you?"
"3809410","3810330"," I thought was a."
"3811610","3812970"," Oregon or something, right?"
"3822450","3825730"," Spent a small fortune on gas and my RV and my trip out. "
"3826450","3827050"," They did."
"3827170","3827670"," They stopped it."
"3829230","3830330"," Yeah, it was Oregon, right?"
"3830390","3831670"," 11 a.m. Eastern time. "
"3831890","3834870"," We get the New York Fed second quarter household credit report."
"3840570","3843790"," The only only the only New Jersey in Oregon."
"3848580","3849920"," We're flattening right now. "
"3850740","3852780"," This is the hourly heat map and it's turning."
"3853020","3853620"," It's turning gray."
"3853800","3855000"," It was deep dark red. "
"3856080","3857380"," So we're turning to the upside."
"3857820","3858760"," I'm in calls right now."
"3861750","3863630"," So the market is turning neutral. "
"3873030","3874030"," You have panhandlers."
"3874910","3876290"," Yeah, the weather is good there, right?"
"3876790","3880270"," It's a favorable California's great weather for being homeless."
"3886700","3889960"," It was the first place that I've ever been where I saw. "
"3891480","3893340"," Young adults homeless was California."
"3918200","3920100"," Get the trigger spy going to bounce."
"3920240","3921900"," They need to bounce off the weekly low. "
"3922100","3922940"," Yeah, we have more down to go."
"3923160","3929140"," Well, I think I see Nasdaq going to."
"3929840","3932820"," And Nasdaq looks like it wants the blood right bloodbath right now. "
"3934420","3937320"," And we have another target above on Vix in 1841."
"3938160","3940920"," So it's setting up the bloodbath and watching this right here."
"3941140","3943340"," I'm going to have to stop down in just a moment here. "
"3949900","3952860"," This looks like a role right here to tag this stuff down here."
"3956150","3959330"," I've got a limit on my calls."
"3959690","3969770"," So we'll"
"3969770","3969770"," see. "
"3969770","3970350"," I'm going to move to the downside."
"3971250","3972330"," It's forming right now."
"3972470","3975450"," If you don't have stops, there's a fair chance of some blood air. "
"3989690","3991250"," Nasdaq limping along once again."
"3991710","3996720"," Arley is turning up on the market as a whole."
"4000340","4004320"," But if you saw a quick bloodbath, something like that, it wouldn't shock me with a V shape. "
"4020060","4022280"," Oh, Mando, have you got some barry music?"
"4022440","4023400"," Dude, it's early in the morning, man."
"4023820","4025100"," You want barry music right now?"
"4025700","4026200"," Hold on, brother."
"4026540","4027000"," I'll get you some. "
"4035340","4036760"," See if I can switch it up a little bit."
"4042630","4045370"," Like trying to save barry music for like four in the afternoon."
"4045810","4048430"," Need the whole day to be embarrassed to get barry music, bro. "
"4048810","4059810"," I think it"
"4059810","4060790"," was the only..."
"4060790","4065950"," I'm going to look at the MBI right now, but the market breath indicator, the only sector that"

"4651630","4652330"," Q2."
"4654600","4656200"," So how do you interpret that?"
"4656340","4657700"," It's showing tightening is working. "
"4658100","4665800"," Some of these numbers are like all Q2 but this past month's numbers that came out yesterday was"
"4665800","4669980"," definitely showing some variance to what's what these numbers are saying."
"4673580","4679020"," We have posted the New York Fed household debt and credit report for the second quarter of 2023 on"
"4679020","4679900"," the feed for all those."
"4679980","4685520"," The worst of it is definitely the credit card debt going up 4.6% that's not good. "
"4687760","4688800"," Definitely not good."
"4697250","4701950"," It's definitely not showing that we're it's definitely not showing that people are paying their"

"6164400","6171020"," he's I don't believe that he weighs 300 pounds maybe those results of the 52 week bill auction I'll"
"6171020","6180300"," lead with it if he weighs 300 he looks great on camera for weigh in 300 pounds the Zuckra Zuck's"
"6180300","6188680"," a trained athlete Zucka Burger be like a spider monkey crawling all over Elon wouldn't he did this"
"6188680","6194620"," like like if you watch like the old-school action films always like one guy that's like very small"
"6194620","6201460"," and he like runs around and just starts beating people up and that's how I consider a Zuck trading"
"6201460","6211900"," 23 cents right now 24 cents selling 23"
"6211900","6231990"," right now can't even catch four or five pennies here I mean like seriously four I"

"6270150","6281270"," you are yeah and"
"6281270","6288430"," then I know they trains too right so we know that Zuck trains and I'm gonna assume that Zuckerberg"
"6288430","6295510"," has endurance of some kind so I think Elon was saying well I'll just wear him out and I'm like"
"6295510","6303850"," no I don't think so I was like because if Zuckerberg can serve he probably knows how to go the"
"6303850","6315870"," distance to this is outside of training yet he's"
"6315870","6321010"," been doing it for the last three years too so I think I saw that first picture that came out"
"6321010","6326710"," of Zuck people are like is that Zuck I think I remember the first picture that came out someone"
"6326710","6332870"," caught him in a that's how it broke too right didn't someone like take his picture at some small"
"6332870","6341810"," events a few years ago five spots zero six you know they'll be six percent bit cover issue two to"
"6341810","6347230"," ninety seven two to ninety seven we'll see if this you saw it ain't there don't get trapped in this"
"6347230","6352470"," box and this is not the place you want to be in here up or down I don't care you"
"6352470","6362170"," want to take the the trade below it or the trade above it wait for the cross up here next"
"6362170","6373900"," target above for bulls is four forty six sixty and then four forty six ninety nine I think"
"6373900","6378240"," I think Zuck will destroy him I don't think he'd even have I don't think he would I don't think"
"6378240","6384240"," I only I don't think it'll happen I really don't I don't think the fight is gonna happen I think"
"6384240","6394110"," Elon is way out of his out of his elements like the like the Elon boys I"
"6394110","6401830"," don't know man and Zuck looks like he wants to get down like so like the fact that Zuck wants"
"6401830","6416620"," to get down probably go with take that probably take a pass on that if I was Elon what's the"
"6416620","6424240"," theory behind these boxes right here so this is a consolidation zone right here it's called didlet"
"6424240","6433960"," in the middle don't ever do it and you're looking for well bulls are looking for a cross"
"6433960","6445870"," up here so bulls"
"6445870","6450030"," are gonna be looking for a squeeze up here in a confirmation so this is a one minute chart right"
"6450030","6455730"," here bulls are looking for something like this reversal consolidate above and then you get the"
"6455730","6464230"," break this trade right here is like an eighty three percent of the time printer that's what bulls"
"6464230","6473110"," are looking for right now reversal you're watching the twenty-seven EMA here flatten the 119 or 129"
"6473110","6482520"," it's flattening as well now can we reverse the downside yes start to get closing bars below here"
"6482520","6495230"," they start to break lower see the reversal here oh you would enter short right here but you"
"6495230","6499430"," never you never take a trade in here there's no place for a trade if you want to take puts"
"6499430","6511310"," right here you could which someone did sell short right here yeah I"
"6511310","6515370"," think it's more free advertising I don't think the fight ever ever actually happens unless they"
"6515370","6521150"," have like a gentleman's agreement or some of some kind but even even a gentleman's agreements I"
"6521150","6524690"," don't know that I would get into that fight if I was Elon I think he'd get us I get"
"6524690","6531410"," he gets asked hand to him and Zuck looks like he wants a piece of them so Elon I don't"
"6531410","6537530"," think cares he's just like you know throwing shit against the wall I think Zuck would love to to"
"6537530","6547650"," best him so just just knowing that I would be like no thanks like the Elon doesn't win but"
"6547650","6557550"," it doesn't benefit Elon in any way to actually get that ring with him yeah trying"
"6557550","6568720"," to watch a ball while we're stalling banking system is still strong and not broken yeah I"
"6568720","6574800"," think like I think I think you could tell if there was just mind that Moody's managing from Zuck"
"6574800","6581280"," institution you could probably trust that and fight going down just being a publicity stunt but you"
"6581280","6586740"," know like from the from the tone of Zuckerberg he's serious he's like he's like whatever you want"
"6586740","6593240"," to ready to go down let me know he's like me by the red bridge tomorrow he's like I'm there"

"10074810","10076830"," I want to flip these to 50 if possible. "
"10080930","10081810"," I don't even need the full."
"10082130","10083010"," I don't even need the full."
"10083570","10085730"," So 4.48, they're claiming we're not getting there. "
"10092540","10093820"," I don't believe them."
"10098730","10100270"," Trade in 24 right now."
"10116240","10120960"," Got a sell on calls for 24 cents. "
"10121220","10122120"," Nope, they're gone."
"10136740","10138220"," Coming in to S2 right now."
"10152430","10154750"," See if they pull this back or break over it. "
"10158460","10159560"," Giving get up here."
"10171890","10172530"," It's a good day."
"10180460","10181760"," Trade in 4.46, 92. "
"10186100","10186940"," Looking for the break above."
"10188080","10189880"," Targeting 4.47, 74."
"10216920","10217320"," 51. "
"10218900","10221640"," I think we pull back all the way down to right here."
"10222880","10224680"," It should be the next buy right there."
"10251700","10253760"," Yeah, I'm not going to buy the six right here. "
"10254940","10256600"," I'm not buying that yellow line."
"10256820","10260980"," I'm only going to be, I'm not willing to, like, I want to buy at least this one right here."
"10268340","10269380"," I'm going to buy this if I can. "
"10279120","10282540"," We're about to rip here, so we're going to squeeze."
"10282880","10283460"," It's going to be a big one."
"10283460","10285000"," It's going to be a big move up. "
"10305980","10308040"," Might be one more roll on Apple, too."
"10308180","10308280"," Maybe."
"10312480","10314700"," I'm watching Apple to see if it comes back to check. "
"10314940","10316920"," It's put Apple in a five minute."
"10317540","10320280"," You can see the 27 creeping up to the 129."
"10324200","10327600"," Maybe I'll make it down here just in case Apple wants to go all the way. "
"10336120","10367200"," So 52 to buy 4.47s. Oh, they're"
"10367200","10369040"," cranking the 4.47s right now."
"10372900","10375820"," Even on this red bar, this premium kicking in."
"10402760","10403580"," 3 cents. "
"10403880","10404400"," Come on, man."
"10405700","10406500"," Give me 50."
"10406860","10408160"," How about give me 50 cents?"
"10409120","10409560"," No. "
"10418420","10419880"," Like 54 cents."
"10420100","10420440"," How about that?"
"10421600","10423320"," I'm like, yeah, I'm about 50."
"10423520","10423940"," I'm about 48. "
"10437990","10438850"," I'm not going to catch this one."
"10438910","10439190"," I don't think."
"10441350","10442450"," I'm missing this one. "
"10461980","10462540"," Nino."
"10463980","10466280"," Do you not know what stops are, man?"
"10466860","10469560"," Or do you know where the targets are?"
"10470680","10473700"," I mean, you pretty much got this S2 right here."
"10479230","10491880"," And now you're looking for some kind of a rip to 4.47.44. I"
"10491880","10495100"," mean, or you know you could do Nino too is another thing that you can do here. "
"10495200","10495820"," I'm going to show you guys some."
"10495980","10497180"," So I think we talk about this sometimes."
"10497740","10499400"," Talk to you guys about something important here. "
"10501520","10506760"," If you're like losing money on a 1 minute chart or a 5 minute chart, you shouldn't be losing money"
"10506760","10508620"," on a 1 minute chart too frequently."
"10514030","10515510"," It's a 1 minute chart right here, right?"
"10516190","10519050"," So if you're losing money like crazy, don't even bother."
"10519870","10521690"," It'd be trading like a 15 minute chart. "
"10523830","10525850"," You can trade a 15 minute or 1 hour."
"10525950","10526670"," It doesn't really matter."
"10527770","10531910"," So just right here, you can see this resistance point on the 15 minute chart right here. "
"10532470","10534170"," You have no trade right now."
"10535830","10540430"," Your next trade would be beginning to break above right here."
"10541310","10544050"," And you could try to trade this right here. "
"10544650","10545850"," It's 4.40, 20."
"10546030","10554280"," Although I don't think it rejects right there personally, but there's no real trade for you."
"10555400","10562480"," I guess my point here is if you're getting stopped out and just like losing 50% of a trade"
"10562480","10564480"," or not knowing where to take the money and run. "
"10565400","10567940"," A higher time frame is usually easier."
"10569740","10570560"," Makes sense."
"10576230","10577930"," So rather than getting cut up in here. "
"10584530","10589250"," If you just do a higher time frame with a, you know, a fucking weekly or something or a 1"
"10589250","10591110"," month out call or put, doesn't matter."
"10591270","10603420"," A set of counting ticks on a"
"10603420","10603960"," 1 minute chart."
"10611880","10612940"," See if you can come down here. "
"10614780","10639840"," Now the trading 49 cents right now for 4.47s. Give"
"10639840","10640720"," me that last little candle."
"10644140","10646180"," That last little red candle right there."
"10649060","10651200"," Bears like we're selling this down one more time. "
"10653260","10655180"," There's like here comes the blood, baby."
"10658000","10659040"," Trap a bull."
"10660060","10662480"," Send it down for a new low in the day. "
"10663460","10664000"," Slam dunk."
"10670340","10676240"," The reverse bull reverse or bear trap bull trap."
"10681520","10682600"," No, thank you. "
"10683960","10685940"," We already shouted out XLU yesterday."
"10686300","10688240"," I've got, I've got no wants to trade it."
"10689800","10690280"," Zero. "
"10691660","10693580"," No, no, no wants for XLU."
"10695590","10697590"," Was that 0.03 yesterday?"
"10699430","10701350"," But I have no interest in XLU."
"10705720","10707280"," Now I use it as an indicator. "
"10707520","10707760"," That's it."
"10708960","10710980"," That's the only thing that I use it for."
"10711860","10713400"," I have zero interest in XLU. "
"10714160","10715920"," Trying to beat the SP 500, man."
"10716600","10721510"," I'm not trying to beat the SP."
"10722190","10724950"," So I can't trade XLU. "
"10726450","10727650"," But I get what you're saying."
"10728070","10730690"," Was that 0.03 yesterday on NMBI?"
"10731330","10732750"," It was like oversold."
"10733350","10734430"," Guaranteed was going to get bought. "
"10734870","10735830"," Yeah, it was passed oversold."
"10735950","10738590"," It's all three units totaling $15.47 billion."
"10742060","10744440"," But I'll never get out performance out of it. "
"10744540","10745760"," So don't trade it."

"10765400","10766240"," You want to know?"
"10772920","10781560"," Uh, next short end of the league is in 5.23.99. And I expect that to trade two downside"
"10781560","10782540"," targets on it."
"10788080","10789580"," 478 in some change."
"10793600","10794560"," If that helps. "
"10795920","10805340"," Uh, if you want to dip by in Lily by 47823, but tight stops underneath it."
"10812010","10813790"," I would be short Lily right now."
"10817660","10818520"," Does that help?"
"10823670","10824370"," Uh, SMCI. "
"10824370","10824850"," Hold on."
"10824930","10825250"," I'll take a look."
"10838300","10840360"," Pretty, pretty volatile here. "
"10842980","10847720"," Uh, SMCI is pretty volatile right here."
"10860160","10864680"," Uh, it's bullish here, but, um, it needs a pullback."
"10864960","10867520"," It would be, my honest answer here would be it needs a pullback. "
"10868480","10874300"," It needs to pullbacks like 3.08. Uh, before I would even consider it a buy."
"10877120","10878200"," You could enter day, trade it."
"10888090","10894090"," Intro, intraday above 3.46.11. I'd be a buyer, but, um, you'd have to manage it. "
"10894270","10895070"," It's like good for the day."
"10895290","10895550"," That's it."
"10900970","10903170"," As far as like looking for a dip by, it's lower. "
"10913040","10914240"," Uh, I'm waiting for it to bounce."
"10914440","10915220"," I took the money and ran."
"10916480","10917980"," So I'm waiting for another dip by. "
"10918440","10919460"," I'm flat right now."
"10932120","10933200"," Yeah, I think it pulls back."
"10933340","10934400"," I think Lily pulls back here. "
"10936600","10938440"," Matter of fact, it's trading like it right now."
"10938440","10944980"," So you actually have a bear cross above you on the, uh, 1 in 20 or the 27 EMA as"
"10944980","10945220"," well."
"10945860","10948640"," You got a bear cross above and you just sold off of it. "
"10949320","10954100"," So it's going to probably push higher slightly and, um, confirm it to the move down to that number"
"10954100","10954540"," I gave you."
"10962050","10963170"," You know, lululemon."
"10963870","10965230"," I don't, I'm not a fan of them either. "
"10966950","10968130"," They cost too much."
"10980990","10982550"," I got another squeeze coming up here."
"11001340","11002780"," I was like, yeah, I'll be 15. "
"11003060","11004540"," I'm like, nah, we'll be 25."
"11005380","11006020"," That's plenty."
"11006820","11008180"," You don't want to get torched here. "
"11008480","11009340"," I trapped in this."
"11013730","11018990"," JPM up 0.58%. Look at that."
"11019110","11021130"," A nice dip by for financials. "
"11021410","11021610"," Shocker."
"11023430","11023870"," Docker."
"11024610","11033270"," I always love how I always love how, um, I always love how the news comes out and I'm like,"
"11033310","11037070"," so this morning I've got the financial news on and I'm like, well, who are they rolling out this"
"11037070","11037470"," morning?"
"11038490","11039350"," It's like yesterday. "
"11040690","11044090"," We were looking at the market breadth indicator and we noticed a few things."
"11044770","11046170"," Utilities were down a point."
"11046370","11046710"," Zero three. "
"11046950","11048650"," We also noticed that oil and gas."
"11048930","11052370"," He was his two to sell $42 billion in three year notes."
"11052850","11056550"," He probably did cover was two to 88 with the prior high yield of four spot. "
"11056750","11057850"," Three, four percent."
"11058610","11063070"," And we also noticed that oil and gas right was up and then we were, we noticed that."
"11064250","11067730"," Uh, financials were very robustly healthy. "
"11068770","11072870"," And you saw them roll out, uh, state street and fish."
"11075100","11076900"," Try to talk the market down."
"11077160","11077720"," You remember, right?"
"11077860","11079480"," These are the guys that own the market. "
"11079640","11081340"," They own all the market."
"11081960","11082860"," All of it."
"11086270","11091030"," And then of course, uh, we were looking at financials yesterday and I'm like, I'm like, dude,"
"11091170","11092170"," financials look great. "
"11093530","11098650"," Uh, they are a huge indicator of actual risk off in the market."
"11099210","11102130"," Uh, so like risk off danger top."
"11103790","11108530"," Financials are one of the ones that you like, he's like a deathly sick market. "
"11109290","11110770"," Financials will tell you that we've taught."
"11110870","11115490"," We've brought up in the past about, uh, I talked to you guys about like watching Schwab."
"11116770","11119810"," Uh, to find out if we come into an actual top of the market. "
"11120690","11123930"," Cause that kind of was a time period of signaling bottoming."
"11124570","11125810"," A sector rotation."
"11126410","11131930"," So of course we wake up this morning and boom, we get some more news trying to cool off. "
"11131930","11132630"," Financials."
"11134690","11137450"," And financials grabbing a little bit of a bid here."
"11138990","11142770"," So last person to buy the dip on financials is a rotten egg. "
"11142890","11143930"," It looks like."
"11146430","11152930"," But I always find it fascinating because this news comes out and people paint the walls with it."
"11153010","11154950"," They're like, they're like, it's bad, man. "
"11155350","11156810"," Listen to what they're telling you."
"11157010","11158690"," I'm, I'm listening to these guys this morning."
"11158690","11161890"," And I'm like, nah, no, this is bad. "
"11163590","11167390"," This just looks like cool off the market, cool off financials by a dip."
"11169270","11172510"," And sure enough, they did buy that dip this morning on financials."
"11202000","11205220"," No, no, no, no, the hourly on the hourlies. "
"11205860","11210180"," So what we're, I'm not talking the day on the hourly."
"11211560","11215860"," I think half, I think half of you in the comments right now have fucking zero idea what's going on."
"11217520","11218220"," No offense. "
"11220980","11222500"," I get asked weird questions."
"11222720","11223780"," They got like someone over here going."
"11224740","11229900"," Let's say, uh, DPM down 1.25%. It gives the open 6% lower about to go flat. "
"11230080","11230200"," LOL."
"11230660","11230900"," Yeah."
"11231180","11231500"," So they're like. "
"11232560","11237700"," So you're watching, like, when you hear the news and stuff, is it real or is it not?"
"11237880","11239700"," Is it material stuff?"
"11240340","11245140"," Like the numbers that came out yesterday were kind of implied in the numbers that came out this"
"11245140","11245980"," morning already."
"11247520","11250100"," So the question becomes, is this news material?"
"11251080","11254640"," And if it is, it sticks around for like months, right?"
"11254820","11257320"," It sticks around for like two, three, four, five, six months."
"11257520","11258800"," It's new vol in the marketplace. "
"11259620","11265460"," But a lot of the news that comes out, uh, someone will make it, someone will make it sound like"
"11265460","11266920"," it's the most material thing."
"11267060","11269440"," And then it disappears, right?"
"11270560","11271280"," And so you're like, wait a minute."
"11271380","11271700"," What happened?"
"11271700","11274620"," I thought that like the market was supposed to crash due to this news. "
"11275240","11278280"," And then new news comes out the next day and you're like, no, no, no."
"11278300","11279700"," Look at this new brand new thing over here."
"11280440","11283480"," This is the reason why the market should crash today, right?"
"11283640","11285900"," And you're like, uh, and look, it's bleeding right now. "
"11286160","11288300"," So it's got to be why the market's going to crash."
"11289080","11290900"," And, uh, mostly it's not."
"11291020","11294360"," It's just they just throw it at the wall and see if it sticks. "
"11299380","11305180"," You know what I mean?"
"11305380","11307140"," So you're just like, what's real?"
"11307140","11307620"," What's not?"
"11307760","11312360"," What's unknown to the marketplace, um, pricing in, in market information?"
"11312500","11316620"," Or are we just at a place where, I mean, like yesterday I'm looking at market breath indicator."
"11316860","11323040"," I'm like, uh, makes logical sense to me this morning that I woke up to this news when that sector"
"11323040","11327440"," in particular, uh, was the one that hadn't been whacked yet, right?"
"11327660","11335140"," So as you do sector rotations, uh, XLF was the only one that was still kind of beef cakey."
"11337420","11338300"," You know what I'm saying?"
"11338300","11341300"," So it's like, let's cut down financial so we can move up. "
"11354980","11355920"," Forty five cents."
"11357840","11360800"," Oh, forty six cents to buy that."
"11368240","11370360"," All right, fuck you, forty six cents. "
"11373200","11373540"," I'm in."
"11373980","11374360"," Let's go."
"11374500","11375060"," Let's get up there. "
"11375480","11376160"," Squeeze this shit."
"11380490","11381430"," Start squeezing it."
"11383250","11385130"," Here's summer like days like today. "
"11386010","11387470"," Make my eyes bleed."
"11400460","11401060"," Yeah, exactly."
"11401060","11404200"," So like, oh, no, no bongas saying it best, right?"
"11404540","11408000"," Like the best is when morning headline is market down because of job numbers. "
"11408200","11410700"," Then in the afternoon market is up because of job numbers."
"11411580","11415380"," Like sometimes though, like sometimes I wake up in the morning and I'm like, wait a minute."
"11416060","11417800"," I was like the mark, so the market will be green. "
"11418400","11422760"," You know, and I see an article saying like, uh, market updates, market's red."
"11422980","11424960"," And I'm like, and then like an hour later it's red."
"11425140","11427320"," I'm like, these fucking guys already know it's going to go red. "
"11434720","11437280"," And that's the same thing with jobs numbers too, right?"
"11437360","11437960"," Or any other news."
"11438660","11445080"," Market up, market down due to, and that's, you get that caught those comments like, uh, mark it up"
"11445080","11448160"," on bad news, bad news is good news, good news is bad news."
"11448620","11453140"," All of a sudden good news is good news and bad news is back to be in bad news. "
"11453380","11456500"," In reality, if the shit's there to throw it against the wall, they will."
"11457480","11461660"," Um, if the shit's not there to throw it against the wall, they inverse it, right?"
"11461660","11463620"," So bad news is good news now."
"11464820","11466000"," You know, all that kind of stuff. "
"11474570","11481670"," I think my favorite is always when they drag out, um, who's the guy from, uh, shooting out of time,"
"11481850","11482270"," remember his name?"
"11483210","11484790"," He's like the world's biggest bear."
"11485350","11487270"," Uh, he's got his own fund."
"11489460","11493800"," And he comes out, they broke him out on CNBC and he's like, well, we're still bearish down to like"
"11493800","11494320"," 1600. "
"11495440","11497180"," But we did buy the dip here."
"11498380","11499960"," Because the market's oversold."
"11502900","11505080"," And I forget his name right now. "
"11505760","11507020"," No, no, no, no."
"11507380","11508800"," Um, not Santore."
"11510320","11511200"," What's his name?"
"11511540","11512480"," Uh, Dan Niles. "
"11512960","11513760"," How about Dan Niles?"
"11516280","11518080"," How about Dan Niles?"
"11518260","11520340"," Like Dan Niles will pop up on CNBC."
"11521500","11523240"," He's like a big breath buyer."
"11524300","11525780"," Like whatever breath bottoms out. "
"11528820","11532660"," He's like, we still think that the market is a fraud and it's all going to zero."
"11532660","11536020"," But we did buy the oversold bounce today."
"11539440","11540520"," Yeah, Dan Niles. "
"11546740","11548380"," I'm like fucking Dan, man."
"11549500","11555010"," Oh, yeah, they still drag out Dan Niles this day."
"11559720","11561320"," There's some commentary from city group. "
"11561320","11565960"," We recommend a long so for December, 2024 structure ahead of the CPI print."
"11566220","11567340"," No, no, no, it's Dan Niles."
"11567340","11568840"," I recommend going along. "
"11569060","11574100"," So for December, 2024, via a covered cool structure ahead of the CPI and PPI this week."
"11574440","11576480"," Strategists, including math, I wrote in the notes."
"11579240","11582460"," They can always tell us that was in the depth of buy when they roll them off. "
"11582600","11585100"," Like every time they roll them off, like Sweden would make money tomorrow."
"11586280","11587520"," Dan Niles bought the market."
"11591420","11593860"," Yeah, that's exactly what he says. "
"11594640","11597180"," So super broad old man knows exactly what he says."
"11597420","11603800"," His line is like, um, as go to slogan is that I've got put some short everything right now."
"11604000","11606740"," I have, I've been short for the past 10 years. "
"11606740","11609340"," The auction preview for the three year notes auction data."
"11609340","11610960"," I'm just fairly short."
"11611220","11614700"," This market is net short, one spot, two, six million five year notes. "
"11614900","11616520"," We picked up a small position."
"11616760","11618340"," A possible source of covering demand."
"11619500","11621060"," On a retracement trade. "
"11624160","11625540"," I'm like fucking Dan, man."
"11625660","11627580"," He's been short since like fucking the year 2000."
"11628440","11629920"," It's been short since that. "
"11630080","11635360"," City logo used for his for his funds to billion dollar auction."
"11638320","11639440"," I bet he was."
"11639720","11642000"," I bet he was say we're getting 10 more percent. "
"11643060","11644760"," That does not shock me at all."
"11644960","11648740"," But Dan Niles would say that a three spot one billion dollar average."
"11648740","11650640"," That's long over the past 12 months. "
"11651780","11654000"," If Dan Niles was still short, right?"
"11656460","11658220"," He'd be fucking broke at this point."
"11658800","11660200"," This fund would have imploded."
"11660200","11664940"," He's trading 51 right now. "
"11669360","11671600"," I can't, you know, the guy's been short since like day one."
"11682370","11685470"," And so Dan Niles only has two things that he does."
"11687050","11688590"," Claims are going to zero. "
"11690820","11691740"," And then he bought the debt."
"11697690","11700830"," He's trading 59 selling 59."
"11702350","11702370"," Nope. "
"11702550","11702650"," Nope."
"11703970","11704930"," There we go."
"11705930","11707090"," All right, it did close. "
"11708270","11710810"," Thank you very much for the free money once again."
"11712830","11713470"," Nino."
"11714550","11718430"," Are you going to take the money, please off the table?"
"11720610","11721690"," Put it in the bank. "
"11729120","11729540"," Nino."
"11730200","11731680"," Take the money."
"11740730","11741930"," It's a good day today. "
"11743470","11744750"," Pretty good day today."
"11752540","11753460"," Two to 92."
"11754060","11755000"," Big squeeze. "
"11755680","11757080"," Four spot, three, nine, eight."
"11757160","11757900"," Just rip it."
"11758060","11759080"," Three, nine, eight percent. "
"11760140","11763400"," The U.S. sells 42 billion dollars in three year notes and awards."
"11763620","11764060"," Ninety five."
"11764060","11764280"," Please. "
"11764280","11765280"," Every last one of them."
"11765400","11766220"," It's a tie."
"11768740","11771260"," Primary dealers take 10 spot, three, three percent. "
"11771880","11774700"," Direct 15 spots, seven percent and indirect."
"11775140","11776700"," Seventy three spot, nine, seven."
"11776700","11780900"," I'm out right now, but four forty sevens trading sixty two cents. "
"11782080","11784440"," We're looking for a major rip higher."
"11784900","11787700"," I mean, think about that, right?"
"11787900","11789100"," I want you guys to think about."
"11789860","11791660"," The news that you get. "
"11792500","11794680"," How long does it stay relevant?"
"11796620","11798940"," Until the next news comes out."
"11799080","11799640"," See us."
"11799940","11801560"," Try to parse the difference. "
"11801560","11803620"," Three, nine, eight percent versus four spot."
"11803840","11804720"," In news."
"11804820","11806360"," Like, is this important?"
"11807340","11809300"," Is this not important?"
"11812400","11814760"," Is this a headline being attached to. "
"11815820","11817740"," U.S. three year treasury yields."
"11818040","11819800"," A reason why we're down."
"11820020","11822820"," And another point on this too is. "
"11823380","11825320"," Another point on this too is."
"11826500","11828960"," Think about the reasons."
"11830820","11833380"," Why that news is gaining traction. "
"11834540","11836680"," Or even why the events happen."
"11837220","11839220"," So you get a bank downgrade today."
"11839960","11840300"," By. "
"11840920","11841400"," The stream."
"11841660","11842920"," It's like ticks right."
"11843160","11844220"," And the question becomes. "
"11844320","11845980"," Is it worth it?"
"11845980","11847240"," You just got down great by fence."
"11847240","11847840"," So consumers."
"11848780","11849160"," Get a free. "
"11849220","11853240"," And then the threats of downward downgrades to come on larger institutions."
"11857210","11859330"," So is it material or not?"
"11859330","11861910"," And then who are the people that are giving."
"11863630","11864770"," Are they doing this?"
"11865010","11866110"," I mean, let me be honest with you. "
"11866630","11870910"," Are these guys doing this because they want to buy financials at a lower price."
"11871450","11872950"," Do they have a short on the market."
"11874430","11877330"," How is it that we knew yesterday. "
"11878270","11881190"," The last sector that was well over bought still."
"11882170","11882650"," XLF."
"11885210","11886390"," Needed to get whacked. "
"11887130","11887590"," Right."
"11887750","11888930"," And then you see this news this morning."
"11888930","11890270"," Do you think that's coincidence. "
"11892530","11894630"," Are you that naive to think that's coincidence."
"11898450","11900030"," You shouldn't be that naive."
"11901630","11902750"," You know, usually. "
"11904410","11905730"," There's an idea."
"11909300","11911960"," That some kind of news might drop, right."
"11916430","11918430"," Same thing happens on bottoms. "
"11918650","11920210"," So when you're on a bottom."
"11921070","11923610"," You'll get the worst news possible, right."
"11926060","11928480"," You'll get the news that's, you know, like the worst. "
"11928480","11930440"," Same on tops, right."
"11930580","11931980"," We're actually topping the market."
"11932680","11935200"," It's usually huge exuberance, right. "
"11935500","11936100"," Exuberance."
"11936260","11937560"," Not greed, exuberance."
"11938980","11941540"," Trade in 447.01 right now. "
"11941800","11942720"," Targeting to the upside."
"11943140","11965700"," 447.44. And 447.70. You're"
"11965700","11968300"," like, there's a difference between greed and exuberance."
"11969700","11971180"," So like think about that. "
"11971340","11973120"," You've got greed in the marketplace, right."
"11973120","11978420"," Or even when I'm watching the greed indicators, I'm like, yeah, greed is one thing."
"11980020","11982440"," Exuberance is completely different. "
"11982580","11983840"," You see it with Tesla bulls."
"11984960","11988060"," When Tesla's just screaming higher, right."
"11988220","11991020"," New all time highs, new all time highs, new all time highs. "
"11991700","11994080"," When we're up there on those new all time highs."
"11995300","11996860"," You'll see the exuberance, right."
"11997680","11998780"," It's never coming back down. "
"11998960","12000040"," It's going to a million dollars."
"12001100","12003820"," You get overrun to on social media."
"12004200","12005540"," You never noticed that?"
"12015160","12016300"," Oh, wait a minute here. "
"12016500","12017100"," I missed that by."
"12018340","12019520"," Don't leave me behind."
"12028260","12032360"," So like, same thing goes on bottoms, right. "
"12032760","12047400"," Is that you're looking for, is"
"12047400","12048120"," this rotation?"
"12048740","12049980"," Is it consolidation?"
"12051580","12052360"," Is it distribution?"
"12055950","12058670"," Are we just rotating around financials right now?"
"12075300","12076220"," Crash, QQQ."
"12089960","12091800"," I missed that bar right there."
"12091940","12092620"," I wish I'd bought that. "
"12123580","12126960"," NDX checking, it's 27 right now."
"12141120","12143140"," $4.48 or 21 cents."
"12143980","12146120"," So they're telling you you're not going to get the money with those. "
"12146400","12150160"," I'm a little, I'm a little risk adverse to trading those here."
"12151080","12155940"," I want to buy them really bad, but I want to get trapped in a theta."
"12157480","12160660"," It's from theta murder algo as we come to the end of the day here. "
"12161940","12163320"," 109 in the afternoon."
"12168680","12172200"," Pretty much have what, a half an hour, 45 minutes to figure this out if we're going to go up"
"12172200","12173580"," there and tag that DT or not."
"12191530","12194350"," They're asking me a high fucking price for this right now. "
"12195530","12206780"," It's a big bit on these 4.47s. They"
"12206780","12219440"," ask me for 57 and I'm like, fuck, you know, now"
"12219440","12220000"," trading 55."
"12220000","12223280"," If I get 48 or something, I take it."
"12225540","12228720"," Two big buys right here, two big green bars, one and two. "
"12232120","12235240"," I'm trying to squeeze this up and trade 4.47. 70."
"12236860","12245720"," I'm not liking the 4.48s. Trading 51 right now."
"12246520","12247300"," Almost down there. "
"12249280","12261210"," Almost trading"
"12261210","12262550"," 51 right now."
"12272320","12273360"," Seven botanything."
"12282960","12285500"," I'm watching NASDAQ right now. "
"12286980","12288360"," It's not getting me confidence."
"12297170","12298490"," Yeah, no, I'm looking at it."
"12298630","12299030"," Cues too. "
"12299970","12300410"," I'm not."
"12301370","12304270"," I haven't bought anything yet because I'm watching queues right now going, nah."
"12306650","12309550"," I want to see it regain the 27, you know, a 5 minute. "
"12326460","12335670"," For me to trade, for me to buy, or for me to buy put on so for spies specifically, I"
"12335670","12340590"," need for spies specifically, I'm not ready yet."
"12341290","12342010"," I want to buy calls."
"12342170","12343350"," I want to see us trade. "
"12344470","12346270"," So let me bring this up for you."
"12347250","12351730"," If we could have gone down to like right down here, see this previous load down here."
"12353370","12359550"," If we had traded 15, 119 on NASDAQ, I probably would have bought that. "
"12362990","12364330"," Not trading it."
"12365050","12372150"," I'm like, uh, I should have bought that fucking thing right there."
"12380980","12384100"," It's not a bad place here to buy calls that are like three months out. "
"12385120","12386460"," It's not, it's not a bad place."
"12386500","12387840"," It's like just a call spread in the money."
"12388040","12389000"," I think it like three months out. "
"12389280","12390100"," Yeah, I think you're okay."
"12390500","12394200"," Or I'm affected to make it for like a week after the quarter end."
"12396400","12396960"," Should be plenty. "
"12399200","12400840"," Ten days after a quarter end."
"12406110","12408190"," No, I'm like, we're supposed to squeeze here."
"12408370","12409230"," I'm supposed to trade this. "
"12410150","12415270"," I'm just waiting for the closing bar above the 27 on NASDAQ for it."
"12418440","12420120"," Make sure you've still got buyers here."
"12440570","12442030"," That's 56 cents again. "
"12442610","12445890"," They're as low as they're trading 50, 51 somewhere in there."
"12446690","12473480"," I didn't throw any on US lawmakers"
"12473480","12473880"," aspects."
"12475040","12479040"," Communications commission to address potential threats from Chinese cellular internet. "
"12479460","12482180"," Of things, modules in the US networks."
"12490910","12498630"," Bit of cover was 2.9. Yield was 4.398. We're almost at the top there to that yield."
"12499390","12500710"," We're almost at the top of the yield. "
"12501610","12502350"," We're close."
"12507390","12508930"," We're close to closing the gap."
"12515840","12517260"," Now there's 60 cents. "
"12517500","12518140"," I should have bought these."
"12518860","12520140"," We're about to have some faces off here."
"12520960","12521820"," Big green buyers coming. "
"12524710","12526170"," I missed this last trade here."
"12526510","12527090"," I'm still flat."

"12541270","12542270"," I got 10 cents."
"12542270","12543630"," I got wrecked in that 10 cents. "
"12548740","12551120"," I meant to do AMC yesterday and I didn't."
"12553930","12555790"," That was on my short list yesterday."
"12559080","12560360"," And I never did it. "
"12560640","12561520"," I never reviewed it yesterday."
"12561780","12562160"," I meant to."
"12563100","12566700"," Squeezing again, trading $4.47.05 target to the upside. "
"12567100","12575720"," $4.47. $4.47. Now trading $0.71. They were down to 50 cents earlier."
"12576800","12578400"," I missed the ride on this one."
"12581670","12583230"," $4.48. Trading 30 cents. "
"12583490","12584830"," Be real careful with those."
"12585470","12588850"," If you're trading $4.48, do not leave them on."
"12589950","12591490"," They will blow those things down. "
"12591670","12592650"," No matter how high we go here."

"12635030","12636910"," Smash it in Bastion right now. "
"12637690","12639750"," Give me that last green bar up there, baby."
"12641210","12643770"," There's a place to take the money and run, right?"
"12644150","12645110"," Right up there."
"12645570","12646790"," There's another one above it. "
"12653750","12654950"," We'll talk AMC right now."
"12654950","12658210"," I got to take someone still long here."
"12664680","12677270"," $4.47.77. No. "
"12677510","12678830"," We pin strike that."
"12678990","12679410"," I don't know."
"12684320","12686080"," This one's the safe one right here. "
"12687520","12688500"," There you go."
"12689080","12689360"," Done."
"12692850","12693410"," Yay. "
"12703940","12704780"," Tools, baby."
"12705100","12711340"," You guys are getting tools to be able to do it on your own."
"12711340","12712740"," You won't need to be in the stream anymore. "
"12721850","12742360"," Trading $4.47.41. This"
"12742360","12743500"," bad boy up here."
"12746480","12748180"," You want a high target right there."
"12751460","12752480"," There's a high target. "
"12756500","12758360"," Like here's the high target right here."
"12761960","12763480"," Hot mess trying to get up there though."
"12768140","12773660"," H.G. They're going to be stinky about this one right here, aren't they?"
"12777340","12778260"," You want to play again?"
"12778460","12779380"," You want to do this one more time?"
"12779560","12780340"," We can take this one more time. "
"12784820","12786200"," We're going to come along for the ride."
"12786200","12787780"," Not be so cheap."
"12797160","12799040"," Just a warning to you if you are a bull. "
"12801420","12803240"," Sellers are right here."
"12806880","12808060"," Sellers are right here."
"12808300","12812360"," Just note that this is where the sellers are. "
"12815220","12817600"," We knew what happened yesterday into the clothes, right?"
"12818420","12825900"," We actually slammed up after hours at like $4.14. We slammed up and slammed into S1."
"12827340","12830000"," Then immediately they started selling it off after the bell."
"12831020","12832920"," Then at $1.30 in the morning, I was awake. "
"12833620","12835620"," I was like, are they going to squeeze this thing and run it up or not?"
"12835880","12837780"," Boom, they sent it straight down below the hourly."
"12838560","12839820"," Rejected off it and that was it."
"12839940","12840420"," Start selling. "
"12844950","12845870"," Just right here."
"12846010","12847510"," Just note this is where the sellers are."
"12850090","12851310"," I'll write that in so you know. "
"12860130","12862530"," They're here and they're above right here."
"12877290","12878170"," Nice squeeze trade."
"12878530","12881230"," Take all the cash market stuff back here. "
"12883780","12885940"," And then all this bullshit up in here."
"12886820","12888560"," That's straight bullshit right there."
"12893350","12895310"," This squeeze is going to be epic, man. "
"12895470","12899850"," When this stuff starts running, whoosh, it's going to be fucking beautiful."
"12906760","12907580"," Hey, thanks, Ryan."
"12907780","12908980"," Appreciate for supporting the channel, man. "
"12909340","12910440"," Thanks for the support, brother."
"12911740","12912400"," Appreciate it, man."
"12915930","12916970"," Hey, you're welcome there. "
"12917110","12919630"," S-D-C-A-E's County family."
"12926490","12927330"," Appreciate that, Ryan."
"12936600","12937880"," Green box back right here again. "
"12959550","12961590"," We got some tools coming out right now."
"12961650","12967370"," I've got a bunch of very smart guys working on the website right now."
"12967390","12969790"," It's kind of crazy because they're texting in the background. "
"12971510","12974370"," I've been involved in a text chain right now."
"12975370","12978230"," And I'm like, I understand some of this stuff."
"12978570","12979710"," Some of it, no idea. "
"12981290","12982610"," No idea what they're talking about."
"12995930","12996930"," High target right here."
"12998570","12999870"," That's that trigger above. "
"13005660","13007980"," Check the four-hour performance of the market."
"13021020","13023080"," Does XBI still going up today or no?"
"13023900","13026000"," I was looking at XBI in the open this morning."
"13032830","13033970"," It was sold off, man. "
"13034170","13035450"," XBI not coming up."
"13036430","13038470"," Can't get above the hourly on XBI."
"13039970","13041970"," No getting up on the hourly on that one. "
"13050060","13050320"," AMC."
"13055410","13056090"," Let's talk AMC."
"13066390","13067150"," Tough one. "
"13077060","13079580"," Kind of bearish here on AMC."
"13079580","13080460"," I'll be honest with you."
"13085330","13086810"," Bearish on AMC right now. "
"13088330","13089190"," Not bullish."
"13090750","13091610"," Downside target."
"13092090","13094390"," You don't want to know. "
"13096390","13097250"," Orange change."
"13101460","13102120"," Yeah, thanks, Ryan."
"13102260","13102800"," I appreciate it, brother. "
"13105740","13107120"," Oh, blood right now."
"13110280","13110840"," Blood."
"13119180","13120140"," It's kind of funny. "
"13120300","13123580"," All that blood and calls are still 59 cents right now."
"13126510","13128410"," Some premium leaking in the calls here."
"13133180","13137140"," 312,000 puts on 446 p."
"13139560","13141000"," Trading 26 cents. "
"13146380","13147420"," I didn't mind any calls there."
"13147720","13148580"," So just sitting here."
"13151200","13153300"," So much emotion down here. "
"13155660","13157400"," 447s trading 54 cents."
"13158220","13163000"," So you guys ever want to know why I count off the price of an option on stream with you?"
"13163060","13163940"," Do you know why I do that?"
"13165340","13168980"," I'm interested to see who's in where."
"13168980","13172740"," So if you get an option and we get as early as it starts out the day. "
"13172940","13174940"," Let's say it starts today at 10 cents, right?"
"13175320","13176380"," And we start trading higher."
"13180720","13182280"," I know where people are in, right?"
"13182460","13183320"," They're in on 10 cents."
"13183860","13190160"," So trying to see those are still demand for those options. "
"13190880","13193120"," I'm also looking to see if there's any premium kick on them."
"13193540","13195400"," I'm looking to see if we catch a bounce."
"13195840","13198180"," Now, let's see the trade in 10 cents. "
"13198820","13201780"," We get a bounce and a pretty decent bounce, right?"
"13201780","13203140"," They only go up one penny or something."
"13204120","13204920"," That's not a good example."
"13205060","13205900"," Let's say I have 50 cents. "
"13206900","13208560"," Like 10 cents, you kind of have to go up a lot."
"13208860","13210140"," But let's say it's 50 cents an option."
"13210900","13212580"," And it only goes up a penny or two. "
"13213240","13216760"," I'm watching to see if they're actually going to start ramping the price of those options or not."
"13218660","13220940"," Or if they're even on a bounce, they don't, right?"
"13222760","13224660"," So this premium leaking into an option."
"13224920","13227820"," And I'm looking to see where they're in, like, are people in on 50 cents?"
"13228480","13229180"," They're in on 10 cents. "
"13229580","13230960"," They're going to try to burn these things."
"13231220","13232600"," The dealers actually want to pay this."
"13233020","13234280"," Take all kinds of questions, right?"
"13235020","13238180"," The dealer is actually going to want to pay these if we're going to go there. "
"13240660","13244400"," As a matter of fact, for 48 to now trade 20 cents again."
"13244900","13247340"," So they went up like, well, they were cranking there for a minute."
"13248620","13251820"," So even if they were going to pay them, they're not going to want to send them to $1.20"
"13251820","13253660"," if possible, or $1.50 or something insane. "
"13263480","13269340"," Yeah, Disney, I am interested in buying Disney if they have a bad ER."
"13271140","13272580"," I'm interested in buying it."
"13274080","13275660"," Like actually owning the underlying. "
"13275920","13276420"," Give it to my kids."
"13284040","13287700"," We really need NASDAQ to just fucking hit that 119."
"13288420","13288840"," We can be done. "
"13303640","13304660"," Give me your take on AMC."
"13304980","13306120"," Do you think they're going to have a great ER?"
"13309570","13311130"," It doesn't matter if they have a great ER."
"13311330","13312690"," I guess it's a bigger question, isn't it?"
"13317490","13324170"," I think the one thing about EMC or GME, any of the meme stocks, it's so price driven. "
"13324370","13325050"," It's not even funny."
"13326750","13331150"," It's event driven too, but some of those events are already known too."
"13333350","13335530"," Some reason they're important when they happen, I guess. "
"13348580","13350200"," Yeah, I'm bearish on them right now."
"13356010","13357770"," I think they trade by that sub five."
"13359210","13360210"," I could be wrong though. "
"13360510","13363390"," My point I guess I'm trying to make is, I don't know."
"13363870","13375380"," If it trades above, you're"
"13375380","13377680"," getting a pretty bearish cluster here on it right now."
"13380700","13386780"," You got the one, the five, the hourly rolling down on the daily. "
"13387100","13387780"," I think that's the daily."
"13388100","13388540"," Or is that the weekly?"
"13389040","13389580"," I'm going to be the weekly."
"13391900","13396920"," You got the daily support down below at 478. "
"13399600","13402060"," Or trade sideways until that daily gets up there again."
"13403140","13404180"," It picks it back up again for you."
"13407340","13411220"," Yeah, I think we could call it for 76 or 74, something like that. "
"13432360","13434620"," VIX is about to roll over, get wrecked here."
"13437120","13441360"," Apple's testing a bull plane right now to the upside."
"13441540","13442800"," So VIX is looking very weak. "
"13443560","13444520"," Apple's looking good."
"13445340","13447960"," IWM has another bull plane coming right now."
"13448280","13449280"," It should start squeezing again. "
"13450900","13452660"," Now's deck looking extremely bullish here."
"13456220","13457680"," 448 is a 27 cents."
"13458580","13460100"," They're at 20 just a moment ago. "
"13463010","13465330"," I'm going to be able to take a taste of those 448s."
"13466150","13466850"," It's a little taste."
"13474680","13476100"," I'm missing the buy here. "
"13476280","13477000"," It's not letting me in."
"13480900","13481660"," It's not letting me buy."
"13494120","13495340"," It's a pretty big move coming up here. "
"13496300","13497220"," I should see a major squeeze."
"13498700","13499820"," I'm not in right now."
"13501400","13502720"," Oh, I missed the trade again. "
"13503080","13503480"," Second time."
"13505160","13505920"," Wouldn't let me buy."
"13523740","13524140"," Fuck it. "
"13524320","13524860"," I'm in for 28."
"13525620","13526000"," Taking the risk."
"13526420","13526660"," I don't care. "
"13528340","13529220"," I want to catch the squeeze."
"13537080","13537640"," Being sloppy here."
"13541490","13542310"," Definitely being sloppy. "
"13557420","13561140"," HYG is trying to grind out a gap to the upside."
"13562700","13564920"," VIX bleeding coming into some kind of support."
"13568120","13571940"," Waiting for that 27 EMA in a five minute to rain down though in the VIX. "
"13576500","13577460"," There you go."
"13577740","13578820"," Bloodbath that shit down."
"13582040","13583300"," Trading 29 up a penny. "
"13591300","13593260"," We could get some blood air failure in a roll."
"13594440","13596200"," It could be some kind of weird."
"13596940","13599220"," It's possible we do a roll down. "
"13599220","13601520"," And then the bigger move up."
"13601800","13602660"," Just be aware of that."
"13604790","13606290"," VIX is saying that's possible. "
"13619780","13621140"," Bleed VIX bleed."
"13628380","13629200"," Trading 30."
"13634610","13636070"," Bloodbath in the VIX right now. "
"13666430","13667510"," I'm going to get stopped out here."
"13716350","13716590"," I'm out."
"13721700","13723200"," I lost two pennies on that trade. "
"13724820","13725640"," Maybe three."
"13735620","13737040"," I'm watching the VIX right now."
"13747400","13748180"," Here's the VIX. "
"13748600","13750000"," I'm just watching this VIX right here."
"13753660","13756860"," Let's see if this VIX gets a bit and then blasts down below here."
"13758500","13760000"," The VIX five minute chart. "
"13762340","13770380"," I'm seeing a quick bit in here."
"13772000","13773220"," Let's see it come back down."
"13774940","13777300"," It's almost watching that on spoos. "
"13780020","13781800"," Here's a spy in a five minute."
"13786900","13788400"," I'm thinking it's down here."
"13794550","13795370"," You get this blood. "
"13797830","13799170"," VIX bounce down."
"13800670","13802510"," The dipper is actually here somewhere."
"13859080","13860940"," I kind of like that 20 cents. "
"13861480","13864320"," I kind of like that 20 cents."
"13865100","13871760"," I'm just watching the VIX here."
"13892420","13893960"," I had a cool fire pit. "
"13894420","13896680"," The guy took a."
"13901820","13904540"," We're just going to bloodbath the VIX straight down."
"13904540","13905980"," I can go to the moon."
"13906040","13906740"," Is that what we're doing?"
"13912920","13913780"," This guy had a."
"13916040","13919940"," Like a washing machine drum buried in the ground. "
"13922040","13924480"," With air vents coming up the side of it."
"13927880","13929120"," This is a pretty cool setup."
"13931460","13935260"," Squeeze and I are now trading four forty seven or four forty seven oh five four forty seven oh"
"13935260","13935560"," four. "
"13938960","13940140"," Fuck and miss that."
"13940880","13941460"," We pissed."
"13945000","13947340"," Back to trade twenty seven twenty eight again. "
"13947940","13949840"," It took me for three pennies down here."
"13957040","13958520"," HYG grinding again."
"13961880","13964800"," Oh yeah they're just holding the VIX there to slam it into the ground. "
"13973690","13974950"," No position right now."
"13987490","13989610"," They're going to murder the VIX here in just a few minutes."
"13990350","13991390"," Like straight murder it. "
"13996580","13999000"," Get some fucking bigger targets up there huh."
"14002860","14004640"," Four forty eight forty up there."
"14029330","14030110"," Back in again. "
"14031610","14032830"," I think I'm selling these now."
"14032910","14034130"," I'm just going to sit on them all day long."
"14038070","14039590"," Long again four forty eight. "
"14041770","14048190"," I think I have this field and I just want to sit on them."
"14049050","14051410"," If they go back down to twenty I'll buy them down there again."
"14051990","14053010"," It's not even care at this point. "
"14053290","14053990"," Just long as fuck."
"14056830","14059430"," I want to see him smash this VIX into the ground."
"14060190","14060790"," Oh. "
"14066710","14072870"," Yeah the like it's a big drum buried in the ground with a bunch of bricks underneath it."
"14073730","14076050"," And then he had like two brick."
"14078550","14083290"," I'll explain this like the drum was in the ground surrounded by brick. "
"14083930","14085050"," Brick in the bottom."
"14085810","14087250"," Brick was in the outside of the drum."
"14087250","14093970"," And then he had like a two air funnels on either side of the that ran down into the fire"
"14093970","14094290"," pit. "
"14094410","14100400"," I created like an air vacuum into it or something like that."
"14100400","14101740"," So I burned really hot."
"14115780","14117100"," Yes I think it was doing. "
"14118800","14120780"," So I just burned really nice and clean."
"14125180","14129240"," My my youngest was there kids like kids were there and."
"14132360","14134460"," My youngest one I was like. "
"14135120","14138220"," We're roasting marshmallows and I was like you want to burn one of those?"
"14139440","14140460"," She's like yes daddy."
"14140740","14142040"," I'm like all right let's catch it on fire."
"14142720","14146420"," We started instead of toasting marshmallows we started burning marshmallows. "
"14151030","14156700"," Yeah it was nice I want to put one in."
"14157520","14158140"," I was impressed."
"14167260","14170320"," I guess my only thought that I had on it was probably to be fire brick. "
"14171900","14174660"," And I don't want to catch anything on fire."
"14175380","14175860"," Underground."
"14177120","14182320"," Fair like catching the suppose like well the good thing about where I live is. "
"14183240","14189680"," We're on marshland so you dig down like 10 feet 12 feet and you're brown to hit some water."
"14191720","14196020"," So I'm not as afraid of it here as there would be somewhere else but it's like a real fear"
"14196020","14198100"," of my like just dry out the ground and then boom."
"14198740","14200040"," Get a fire underneath the ground. "
"14208230","14209390"," Yeah fire was great."
"14209830","14210710"," It was a good party."
"14211290","14212250"," A summertime party. "
"14225200","14226420"," Yeah I call the dig line."
"14226960","14229560"," I have that it's free they come out they flag everything."
"14230500","14232560"," It's like the most no brainer thing you could do. "
"14240050","14243810"," Check out briost over solo stove smokeless if you start them right."
"14244030","14244150"," Nice."
"14256620","14262160"," Yeah like I try to like I try to teach them so we did a whole thing on how to"
"14262160","14263880"," start a fire with. "
"14267260","14267700"," Flint."
"14268920","14271000"," And they were able to do it so that was good."
"14272220","14274460"," Try to teach them how to respect fire the dangers of it. "
"14276260","14277320"," Trading 30 right now."
"14285690","14289170"," Oh I just got a text from Joe with Joe donut."
"14303060","14307120"," Yeah I think there's a part of there's a part of it with kids where. "
"14308260","14308620"," If you."
"14310260","14314040"," Like it's kind of like anything right if you don't do it with them and they're going to do it"
"14314040","14315480"," by themselves right so."
"14315940","14319480"," Like ban your kid from respecting and learning about fire. "
"14320240","14323620"," They're likely going to go in the backyard when you're not looking and."
"14325040","14327540"," Try to start a fire maybe burn the house down or something."
"14329100","14332160"," So there's a balance to that in age to that too. "
"14341940","14342420"," No."
"14343860","14345260"," No it's not concerning me."
"14346540","14347660"," No concern here. "
"14350600","14355040"," Just give it just just going to take some time here 27 is going to come down just smash through."
"14356480","14359020"," The VIX here so parking the VIX."
"14360900","14364180"," VIX is VIX is like ready to walk the plank right now. "
"14364580","14366620"," It's going to take it out to the wood shed here in just a few seconds."
"14369990","14379000"," Or it should be if it changes."
"14381160","14381800"," I'll exit. "
"14418560","14422000"," Can't wait for the hedge on the market to roll over in the end of the month."
"14422620","14423980"," All that shit to expire."
"14431180","14433360"," I'm going to hear a giant popping sound to the upside. "
"14445290","14447610"," Need more bad news by end of the month."
"14449930","14451130"," More doom by end of the month."
"14451410","14453050"," Going to start writing the articles right now. "
"14457080","14459120"," I'm not getting out of this trade right now."
"14461540","14462240"," It's going to hold them."
"14467270","14470670"," Lily down minus two and a half or two percent right now. "
"14483130","14484310"," Lily bleeding here."
"14515200","14515960"," They give me 20."
"14516120","14518280"," I'm going to buy some more at 20 if I can. "
"14528370","14529730"," They're asking 24 right now."
"14560720","14565560"," I would agree that later in the day the more important entry price is on zero dates with gamma"
"14565560","14567240"," building making moves more volatile."
"14568000","14568920"," Yes and no. "
"14572600","14575080"," I've seen a lot of fuckery in the past couple weeks."
"14578340","14581320"," I've all crushed on options specifically zero dates."
"14595120","14595660"," It's okay. "
"14595840","14599060"," One of these days when it rips I'm going to probably make like 4,000 percent or something."
"14599500","14601060"," I already know it's going to happen."
"14604500","14605080"," One of these days. "
"14637520","14638980"," All I know in K."
"14642740","14643820"," It's about 10 view."
"14651090","14652930"," Is that the ticker that you're talking about?"
"14690790","14694590"," You're trying to buy a dip on it because of the volume that's coming into it since August."
"14695230","14698210"," It looks like tons of volume have come into it. "
"14698850","14701070"," Now there's some capitulation selling going on again."
"14711320","14712080"," I think I've got good numbers."
"14712320","14713420"," I'm looking at their numbers right now. "
"14719390","14720850"," Yeah, I'm looking at it right now."
"14720850","14727180"," I'm long here just so you know."
"14728860","14732660"," I am long here so I own calls here. "
"14737030","14738790"," Yeah, their numbers look great."
"14743340","14745420"," The chart looks like shit."
"14750860","14752960"," So here I'll bring up one chart real quick. "
"14765220","14766780"," So this chart right here."
"14768440","14770300"," All it looks like here is like."
"14773040","14774760"," See, they bought the shit out of this, right?"
"14775900","14779860"," So you kind of know that that's where bottom is, but then I'm seeing this selling down here. "
"14780500","14783080"," It's almost like they bought it and then said, fuck it."
"14783680","14783920"," Right?"
"14788690","14790270"," What is that 22 and a half?"
"14791030","14792090"," Is where they are."
"14792990","14793290"," So. "
"14812310","14815070"," Looks like they want it right now 22 and a half."
"14819770","14821530"," And we're trading currently."
"14822770","14826070"," I'm not 22 half as I get the wrong the wrong tick. "
"14829000","14830280"," Yeah, it's 22 and a half."
"14830440","14836460"," So, well, but it does look like they're selling out of it."
"14836500","14838980"," So I'd be wary of a new low on it. "
"14839160","14840360"," You know, if you really want to buy it."
"14841220","14847540"," You need to buy it above 23 and a half with a stop underneath it."
"14847540","14856080"," I started a 24 50, but I don't know that it's doesn't look healthy right now. "
"14856220","14857120"," This is my point."
"14858720","14865140"," No, you'd want to see like that when you dip buying here, I'll draw it out here."
"14865880","14870300"," So when you like dip buying, right, when you have like a stock, yeah, there you go. "
"14870460","14871160"," Keep printing that shit."
"14872260","14873500"," Print that shit some more."
"14877610","14885220"," So when you're in distribution, right, I'll make a red. "
"14885220","14888640"," So make it make it better for you if you're a bear bears like seeing red."
"14891270","14895390"," So if you're in distribution, you know, whatever happens there."
"14896230","14899290"," Second leg down, I guess third leg down, let's say, right?"
"14899950","14900670"," So bloodbath. "
"14900990","14902270"," So you have the capitulation moments."
"14905210","14908050"," And then you're looking for the consolidation period."
"14908790","14913870"," I recheck and then it begins to move higher and it gets in a trend. "
"14918340","14923710"," Maybe I should do it like this."
"14923710","14925670"," You know, just get rid of the whole fucking thing."
"14925770","14930120"," It's a pretty fairly easy thing to see. "
"14930240","14930780"," Hold on a second here."
"14931960","14938630"," So you have the, you know, not consolidation."
"14939190","14939890"," Now we're in distribution. "
"14940370","14941810"," We're just coming at some pumps."
"14942130","14943690"," It wasn't one straight line down."
"14949560","14951980"," And you have this consolidation area here, right?"
"14953760","14954680"," The break above. "
"14962260","14963100"," Bullish again, right?"
"14964280","14969640"," You know, when you see this capitulation move down here, you can probably look to buy any of these"
"14969640","14973300"," dips for that move higher and to be here."
"14975880","14979920"," The better way to do it though, the most, the safest way to do it is not to buy any"
"14979920","14980240"," of this."
"14981340","14987160"," And you wait for the consolidation confirmation that we're going higher and you just get in for"
"14987980","14989620"," that part of the run on that ticker. "
"14990600","14995180"," The reason being is you can get caught in here for a week, a month, three months, six months, nine"
"14995180","14995440"," months."
"14996440","14997560"," It's where people get trapped in here."
"14999640","15002840"," So if you're looking at that ticker right now, it's my point. "
"15003660","15005460"," You're looking at that ticker right now."
"15005620","15009400"," Where are we in terms of taking it long?"
"15010880","15016520"," So you know that at 22 and a half there's demand or the last known demand was that 22 and"
"15016520","15016760"," a half."
"15017360","15022540"," So I guess if you want to wait for that, set yourself an alarm down there 22 and a half. "
"15023020","15025100"," Buy a dip with a stop under 20."
"15025980","15030100"," And I would think that down at 22 and a half, the fact that it's already been tested, it would"
"15030100","15031560"," be likely to test 20."
"15032060","15035740"," So I might actually make it a 20 bucks for that ticker. "
"15035900","15041700"," Now if it breaks out above and starts to close all that gap and shit above, you'll be ready for"
"15041700","15041880"," it."
"15050980","15051480"," Do you know what I mean?"
"15052620","15055360"," It's hard to say buy that ticker right now."
"15056460","15061040"," The point behind it too is that there's a million other tickers that are right there ready to go. "
"15061040","15064960"," So you know you've got other places that you can make money."
"15065120","15067380"," What are you going to do like tie up a bunch of cash in this ticker?"
"15067480","15070900"," It's going to sit there for six or nine months before you get a print on it."
"15073320","15074480"," Yeah, a state of game paradise. "
"15075140","15080200"," And as a matter of fact, if you're a state of gang, you are looking for that, right?"
"15080480","15084600"," If you're a state of gang, you're looking for that, you know, the capitulation is over."
"15087340","15089060"," It's starting to do this here."
"15090060","15092240"," And this is like theta gang heaven in here, right?"
"15105270","15108630"," 158 coming into the two o'clock half hour. "
"15109750","15115830"," 2 p.m. Failure to make a new high right here."
"15115930","15116530"," I don't like that."
"15120340","15122700"," I'm going to probably end up cutting this loose at some point. "
"15123880","15126080"," About two minutes left to make a new high here."
"15147980","15152200"," The big news, the one that I'm always scared of is S&P."
"15152800","15154720"," I'm not really concerned about Moody's. "
"15155000","15158840"," I'm concerned about S&P 500, but Senator Pors."
"15160160","15163640"," Any kind of downgrade from S&P, you're going to get a leg down."
"15164360","15165680"," 100% like a leg. "
"15166540","15168620"," We're still trading the daily trigger right now."
"15169580","15170740"," We still haven't come off."
"15170860","15172100"," We're in a one minute fucking chart here. "
"15172440","15173740"," So nothing has changed."
"15174780","15176420"," S&P, I warned you."
"15176820","15181160"," Well, if he didn't know, S&P is the one that you want to be scared of. "
"15181720","15183020"," That's the one that's no fucking around."
"15187620","15189840"," Like S&P is the dirty, dirty dog."
"15189840","15194080"," That's the one that's like, if it means something, S&P will come out and say something. "
"15200360","15202540"," Yeah, if you saw S&P come out and like do another downgrade."
"15228180","15229040"," Still long here."
"15231060","15231800"," Two o'clock. "
"15232020","15233320"," We need a big green bar here."
"15233780","15236560"," So we need a green, like big giant green, new hot."
"15236660","15237560"," We just need a new high. "
"15238540","15239940"," We have to get a new high here."
"15260310","15263570"," And the excess thing, it's a six E.M. and it's five in it right now."
"15265380","15267080"," I don't have you, I'm looking pretty bullish here. "
"15271780","15274020"," Vix is just like sitting there."
"15275100","15276500"," It's like just sitting there."
"15279030","15284170"," These days, man, I'm like trading this garbage all day long. "
"15284570","15287310"," Look at that."
"15288950","15290010"," Garbage, garbage, garbage."
"15290930","15293690"," All I'm looking for is this last little push up right here. "
"15304150","15306130"," They're not getting the new high right now."
"15306210","15306770"," It's not bullish."
"15307430","15308790"," It's 201 right now. "
"15309510","15311090"," Coming into the new half an hour."
"15332020","15333520"," Yeah, they can still come out."
"15333640","15334120"," I'll say that. "
"15334340","15339040"," It doesn't matter that they got downgraded in 2011 and never got another upgrade."
"15339780","15342880"," You don't want to see S&P coming out and saying something."
"15343840","15344980"," You do not. "
"15345140","15347100"," You don't want to see the standard pour or say anything."
"15347660","15349300"," If they do, I'm going to take that one serious."
"15350000","15350740"," That'll be a serious. "
"15353470","15354510"," Yeah, I agree, Joey."
"15355930","15357130"," Do you see that?"
"15357290","15361990"," Like downgrade or even which the good two is .2 in trade."
"15362270","15367570"," In trades just said S&P might have no choice but to say something in case of a credit event. "
"15368150","15370290"," So they don't get accused of ignoring the warning signs."
"15370350","15372210"," They don't actually have to do the downgrade."
"15372410","15377110"," Do they agree with you in 100% they could just come out and say something and that would shake"
"15377110","15377570"," the market. "
"15380940","15384100"," Yeah, accused of ignoring the warning signs even with their downgrade."
"15396660","15398580"," I don't see the credit event though."
"15398660","15399460"," I don't really see it. "
"15399840","15401400"," Well, I see it come in once."
"15402020","15403240"," I do see it coming."
"15403640","15404880"," I don't see it right now. "
"15437620","15439340"," I don't think we're ready for it."
"15439340","15441540"," I think it's I think it comes next year at some point."
"15448420","15450380"," We still have mortgages being made. "
"15451520","15455560"," Personally, like on a main street, like with a main street hat on."
"15456740","15461500"," I want them to get rates above the rate of inflation."
"15462020","15462540"," I really do. "
"15462540","15468220"," I want to go like I want to go above the rate of inflation and try to knock inflation down."
"15469120","15471240"," But I don't think they're going to do that."
"15472800","15475360"," The thing that's concerning me most here. "
"15477580","15482640"," Is like we're yesterday, we're talking about unions fighting for $50 an hour."
"15483320","15486700"," A lot of unions have moved to that $50 an hour already."
"15486700","15494260"," I don't want to see if I see if I see everybody being paid $50 an hour. "
"15498460","15505580"," That doesn't mesh with we're going to braise rates above the rate of inflation doesn't."
"15505740","15506720"," It's telling you already."
"15509110","15510250"," It's already telling you. "
"15513720","15521420"," It's a fairly easy way to see is is inflation coming down and our wages coming down."
"15522200","15525340"," We already had talked about job destruction."
"15526900","15527740"," Stuff like that. "
"15527920","15531760"," But just not seeing that seeing people arguing and winning."
"15532340","15536200"," Hey, you're going to get paid $50 an hour says that wages will still be high."
"15536340","15538580"," And if they are still high. "
"15540200","15541620"," You know what that means, right?"
"15541960","15544640"," You know that the cost of services and goods are going to go up."
"15545480","15548540"," And it also means you're going to price the stock market higher."
"15549900","15551200"," To account for that. "
"15553960","15557560"," You realize that the market goes up right when that happens."
"15557560","15559820"," Maybe some of you don't, but market does go up."
"15560180","15564960"," But the main street hat is like, you know, like rock us with rate increases. "
"15565740","15568260"," Even if it takes two, three, four years to do."
"15571350","15574890"," But wage like wages sticking is telling a different story."
"15574970","15577010"," It's disagreeing with that happening. "
"15581400","15582400"," You know what I'm saying?"
"15582400","15589440"," So like maybe some of you guys probably like wages stay up and inflation goes up."
"15589480","15590140"," The market's going to crash."
"15590760","15594200"," We just go up and inflation comes down, markets going to crash, but. "
"15595520","15597860"," They'll reprice the stock market to the upside."
"15598000","15599660"," We'll get an explosive move higher."
"15600780","15607090"," So that's because part of the thesis, right, is you have to think about what the Fed is saying"
"15607090","15607650"," they're going to do. "
"15608930","15613510"," And then you also have to think about watching wages."
"15613830","15618630"," So when we go out right now, right, the cost of the cost for me to go out right now"
"15618630","15621210"," with my family is out of control."
"15622430","15627830"," Like simple things are 300 500 bucks. "
"15628930","15629510"," Simple."
"15631430","15639410"," Matter of fact, I went to Costco the other day and it was like a small shopping trip and it"
"15639410","15641870"," was 300 and some dollars."
"15642590","15645790"," Not a lot of stuff in that cart off that 300 bucks. "
"15646290","15647390"," That was just Costco."
"15654540","15658060"," You know, so if they know that if they know that wages are going to stick at 50."
"15659380","15662760"," And if wherever I go, I'm seeing people getting paid big money. "
"15663320","15667480"," That doesn't bode well for the price of the stock market coming down."
"15668540","15669520"," Believe it or not."
"15669900","15672440"," It doesn't bode well in stock markets going up. "
"15682960","15684900"," It is telling you that it is telling me that."
"15687290","15691250"," It's telling me that inflation will rage regardless of what the Fed does."
"15691470","15691770"," There's some. "
"15692650","15697910"," So there's some Fed speakers from way back in the day."
"15699890","15705050"," 70s, 80s and they've written books and shit and they've said things like, you know, I don't really"
"15705050","15708970"," think I don't know if raising rates actually fights inflation."
"15710770","15714610"," Like we use that tool and we use it as a tool like they've admitted. "
"15715330","15720650"," We use it as a tool to scare the market right or tell the market."
"15721370","15723330"," We're like, tell the people as well."
"15723530","15724150"," We're doing our job. "
"15724270","15724810"," We're fighting this."
"15724950","15725430"," We're fighting that."
"15725750","15730650"," But there are actual Fed presidents that are quoted as saying they don't know if that actually"
"15730650","15731010"," works. "
"15734480","15739620"," So when you're looking at rates are being raised right now, but you're seeing wage inflation or"
"15739620","15740500"," wage inflation."
"15742140","15744800"," Now, there's a there's the big three are going through this right now."
"15744800","15753000"," They're negotiating a labor contract with a UAW workers and they're asking for 50k or $50 an hour. "
"15753660","15756800"," And they're a lot of their fellow unions."
"15757200","15761680"," I don't know what you call these things, but other unions are getting paid those wages right now."
"15762840","15769940"," So if I'm selling a service or a good to one of those people, I know they have 50 an"
"15769940","15770160"," hour. "
"15770360","15772640"," I know that a good percentage of the population right now."
"15773080","15777780"," It's probably making 50 an hour asking for $50 an hour."
"15777780","15780480"," And I don't think that's a bad thing. "
"15780560","15781140"," Think about it."
"15781900","15782340"," What do you think?"
"15782480","15784120"," Like 20 bucks an hour or what?"
"15784260","15785280"," We're paying people 20 bucks an hour."
"15785340","15786020"," What a decade ago. "
"15786200","15790720"," I was you to actually hear water flame futures for the numbers."
"15790900","15792500"," They tell you about inflation and what's real."
"15792720","15793120"," It's not. "
"15793340","15795920"," We know what's real right in the real world."
"15796040","15799500"," And we know that there was stagflation in wages for a long time."
"15799500","15807080"," We know that you're going to start paying people $30, $40, $50 like an entry level labor is going"
"15807080","15808260"," to start making 30 an hour. "
"15809080","15813600"," And your skilled labor is going to start factory workers skilled labor is going to start making 50"
"15813600","15814580"," an hour minimum."
"15816600","15818820"," I'm going to charge more to those people, right?"
"15819440","15820540"," I'm going to be like, okay."
"15821340","15826900"," So I know this guy's making a third more half more double his salary. "
"15828180","15831020"," I know he has the ability to pay me more, right?"
"15839410","15839810"," Wrong."
"15842220","15843660"," The numbers came out yesterday."
"15844180","15845840"," I mean, you can like, you can see these numbers. "
"15845960","15847000"," You can actually see them."
"15848020","15849440"," I think there's data on this."
"15849660","15850680"," Wages are going up. "
"15851820","15852940"," I don't know if you know that."
"15853080","15854460"," Wages are going up quantifiable."
"15856920","15857840"," Wages are going up. "
"15863480","15866900"," If you, your wages might not be going up, but they're going up for most people."
"15871140","15872360"," It's associated with the pores."
"15873280","15877640"," Even in, even in what I do, I hire guys all the time to do construction for me. "
"15879080","15883160"," And my base labor is up from 20 cash to 30 cash."
"15884600","15886700"," As a matter of fact, I can't expect to pay."
"15886920","15888560"," I wouldn't feel right paying somebody. "
"15889000","15889920"," I'll be honest with you."
"15890240","15891680"," I wouldn't feel right paying somebody."
"15892480","15894240"," No, no less than 30 an hour. "
"15895680","15898520"," I wouldn't feel I'd have a guilty conscience over it."
"15908710","15909110"," Yeah."
"15910050","15911510"," I think 30 isn't enough. "
"15912390","15915890"," I don't think that's a, that's a living wage in any way, shape or form, personally."
"15917210","15921550"," I think you're, I think you're basically paying your, what, like your rent and your utility."
"15921910","15923490"," Like, 30 an hour, you're probably paying your rent utilities. "
"15924710","15931070"," And you're probably one step away from, like, some of the stuff Bob bugs me because, you know, you"
"15931070","15933310"," hit, like, see someone driving without car insurance."
"15934410","15936790"," And you know it's because they can't afford it, right?"
"15938230","15942990"," You want them to be able to afford car insurance so that they, you know, if you get an accident,"
"15942990","15943930"," they can cover it."
"15944050","15945030"," Instead, they're driving dirty. "
"15945710","15946990"," They say in Detroit, driving dirty."
"15955100","15956900"," Well, that's what I, that's what my point is, Jimmy."
"15957820","15958800"," That's what my point is. "
"15958980","15960120"," I agree with Jimmy here."
"15960400","15961900"," I'm actually on your side, Jimmy."
"15962420","15963820"," So, and that's the key, right?"
"15964180","15965120"," What's the key behind this?"
"15965580","15969920"," If your wages are going up, I'm going to charge you more, right?"
"15971120","15973480"," And that makes money cheaper, right?"
"15973780","15978440"," So, that 30 or 50 an hour goes back to being worth 20, right?"
"15978700","15982680"," So, then you have to have a higher price on stocks due to that, right?"
"15984260","15985280"," Money's cheaper, right?"
"15991380","15992240"," Yeah, I agree with you, Jimmy. "
"15992500","15992940"," I'm with you, man."
"15996940","15997820"," Still long here."
"16007640","16008860"," Yeah, 41 an hour is not enough. "
"16011240","16012080"," Nowhere near enough."
"16013820","16014800"," I don't think it's enough."
"16015300","16020620"," I don't think, I think, I think, I think, I think, like, 40 is the start of being enough. "
"16021860","16023420"," I would expect, right?"
"16023720","16028220"," If I was making, right now, if I was making 30 an hour, I'd probably be able to pay my"
"16028220","16028460"," bills."
"16029460","16033880"," If I was making 40 an hour, I could likely put 9 or 10 bucks to that away."
"16034940","16036400"," Oh, you guys are seeing it go up right now?"
"16041100","16046240"," I probably see it probably looking for like an extra, you could put away like in a bank. "
"16047880","16049440"," Say you're making 41, right?"
"16049560","16051040"," If I put away of that what?"
"16052300","16053460"," Six or seven dollars."
"16054420","16055680"," Come on, squeeze in, baby."
"16056600","16056940"," Great. "
"16057080","16057420"," And 32."
"16058700","16059180"," 33."
"16062780","16064140"," I'm going to sell 33 here. "
"16093920","16098960"," I just, I'm in the 40s and I'm like, no, we're going back to 25 again."
"16101620","16105680"," My brain is like by 50, by 100, by 50, by 100."
"16121720","16123100"," Yeah, I'll tell you. "
"16124500","16125560"," I'm going to tell you something."
"16125840","16128540"," If you are, if you are not getting paid, right?"
"16129240","16130660"," This is a warning to you if you're working."
"16130660","16132900"," If you're any person in your family, I don't care who they are. "
"16133340","16135740"," If they're, if they're working, right?"
"16138300","16143280"," And this is the time to still be looking for work elsewhere."
"16144860","16150160"," And, and do not have any like sympathy for taking a different position somewhere."
"16152370","16154350"," Do not like have any sympathy for that. "
"16154350","16157450"," Even if you just got a job, start looking like right away, start looking."
"16158870","16160990"," I'd be looking for 30 to 40 minimum."
"16163400","16164680"," 30 to 40 minimum. "
"16168680","16170360"," Trading the daily trigger right now."
"16171480","16174000"," At a price target of 447, 77."

"16177820","16180700"," There's known sellers here in the daily trigger, so be aware of that."
"16197760","16199440"," Wrangling the spy right now."
"16204610","16206170"," More upside to go. "
"16207710","16208730"," You know what I said?"
"16208930","16209830"," That was the only place."
"16210110","16211890"," I think we go here, believe it or not."
"16212350","16213490"," I think we're not done. "
"16215330","16218150"," I want you to see this curve coming up."
"16219110","16219910"," Pretty bullish here."
"16223740","16225340"," Even more bullish. "
"16233930","16235390"," Rip faces off."
"16235610","16236790"," Take us to 4840."

"16480689","16489279"," So just for today, just one little fun fact here."
"16496869","16498750"," See that yellow bar right there?"
"16498910","16499390"," Watch my cursor. "
"16499970","16500950"," Notice how it went up."
"16502529","16504710"," And we're coming back to it right now."
"16505790","16507869"," You know, that thing keeps coming up, right?"
"16509669","16513970"," And you keep doing this, and you get that price under here. "
"16514950","16517230"," Get that price under here just like a sew."
"16517750","16521070"," And we're going to start going up there and closing out a bunch of stuff."
"16531150","16532950"," So much for stock market crash. "
"16539029","16540330"," What are you doing, bears?"
"16541410","16544970"," How many times are you going to try to sell this thing and try to get an actual correction?"
"16545570","16550290"," By the time you get a correction, that weekly is going to be up here."
"16553650","16554550"," Time, baby."
"16558820","16560700"," Time is not on a bear's side. "
"16561000","16562500"," There's two actions happening here."
"16563460","16566360"," They need real downside moves."
"16567660","16568640"," Haven't gotten that. "
"16572210","16576070"," They need big, big risk off downside moves."
"16576070","16580110"," And monthly puts going to be rolling off real soon."
"16581130","16582950"," You know what that, you know what happens with that, right?"
"16583630","16585550"," All you gamma boys knows what happens with that. "
"16593560","16596279"," They'll look back on this in like a week or two or three weeks."
"16596279","16597980"," You're going to be like, damn, I should have bought that."
"16598200","16599439"," I should have bought monthly calls there. "
"16600140","16603419"," Instead, I was listening to bears telling me about how we're going to get a correction minimum, if"
"16603419","16603880"," not a crash."

"19149330","19157730"," on a 15 minute chart, the big issue here is like you get the squeeze there, I get that, but"
"19157730","19164510"," then you need the bounce higher, it's a lot of work that needs to be done, there's Friday right"
"19164510","19173370"," there, you get the failure right here, I guess you get the second failure right in here"

"19254320","19261700"," on 45s for Friday, so we'll see if it doesn't start going up or there's some couple signposts to"
"19261700","19273690"," take the money off, so that one signpost take the money off is right here, just so you know, you're"
"19273690","19280930"," next signpost is somewhere in here, a failure, so 451 you can hold them to 451, exit them if you"
"19280930","19289440"," want, take the money and then re-enter down here, there's a couple trades in there, so between here"
"19289440","19299090"," and Friday, there's actually a pullback here too, I want you to see this, so just be"
"19299090","19306190"," aware of this here, end of the close, right where we are right now, would not be a shock to"
"19306190","19312650"," see, pay attention to this on a five minute charge, it's important, we're getting a trend shift"
"19312650","19319170"," right now, reversal, trend reversal, I want to show you guys this, we're getting a trend reversal"
"19319170","19326390"," right now, so this could get sold down and then a bounce right here, so just be careful, you can"

"19357590","19364530"," then a continuation to the upside here, it's going to be very powerful, so just be aware of it,"
"19370470","19378030"," there was a confirmation already right here, I want to show you what this means too, because some"
"19378030","19383310"," of you all might not know what it means, so I want to show you guys this, so you got"
"19383310","19389770"," a trend reversal starting here, it's not confirmed yet, but it's going to confirm again, it"

"19397390","19404330"," this all the way up, okay, as long as we are above this white line right here on this confirmation,"
"19405190","19415160"," we stay above this white line, it should last for multiple days, so I'll"
"19415160","19424770"," explain this for you better here in just a second, close that down, I'm"
"19424770","19435780"," going to show you this, that way, now"
"19435780","19443880"," I can last one day, I can last three days, what matters here is we're hitting our resistance points"
"19443880","19455170"," right, so it's a good example right here right, we know resistance is up here and we"
"19455170","19465070"," came up, slam down right, slam down, slam down, cross right here, right, slam, slam, slam, slam,"
"19465290","19475290"," then up, boom, hit it, right, same concept right here, so I had to pay attention to this, and"
"19475290","19485220"," I will tell you this, you've got way better velocity on this move, way better velocity, like"
"19485220","19494480"," violent moves higher, it's like vicious here, so if this thing holds, it continues up, you're going"
"19494480","19503910"," to see a squeeze up here, and I actually think that the rejection there is going to go higher, so"
"19503910","19513950"," I think it's even stronger, extreme bullishness right now, saying"
"19513950","19523650"," that, saying that to you, you know, it's the same as this whole week has been, you wake up tomorrow"
"19523650","19530190"," and they saw it on bullshit news right, and then you're like, what the fuck happened there, I'm"
"19530190","19539610"," sorry the Moody's News to me was, you know, let's, let's clean out, let's clean out XLF, now this"
"19539610","19545170"," does look stronger, it's got good, it's got good, like meat to it, whatever it is, the velocity is"
"19545170","19554760"," where it should be, seeing lower, higher lows on velocity, so I'm pretty fucking bullish here,"
"19556140","19566130"," and if there's any role until we get to, until we get to, there's a price target"
"19566130","19576650"," right here for you, just so you have it, price"
"19576650","19586850"," target above 450.69 might take more than today, but any dip buy on the way there, and"
"19586850","19592690"," if it breaks out above and starts to hold, we're going to take, if it breaks out above this number"
"19592690","19598850"," here, like, smashes up here and holds, we'll take the next trade to close the next gaps above,"
"19601960","19611930"," we'll enter something like that, so price target above 450.69 could"
"19611930","19616950"," take overnight, could take tomorrow, no, I want you to also know they're going to try to keep"
"19616950","19626890"," selling this down, I guess it was"
"19626890","19630550"," worth staying here today, I was going to take the entire day off, I'm like, I don't want to do"
"19630550","19634530"," this today, I'm like, they're going to trade this shit sideways, this is a good, this looks great,"
"19634530","19644500"," so I'm happy, long, long to 450.69, I've got 455 C's"
"19644500","19656030"," right now, they're cheap, we'll see where they go into Friday, I'm"
"19656030","19662730"," most definitely not seeing the pumping dump, so I don't see that right now, Velo is on the bull"
"19662730","19681060"," side right now, so I'm going to disagree with that, bears losing a Velo right now, HYG"
"19681060","19695210"," slamming on a high right now, they did close their gap, traded"
"19695210","19703270"," 75 on the high, they have the bull cross three days ago as well, you can see a pullback at"
"19703270","19713370"," 74.82, but otherwise looking to buy that dip as well, HYG, Vix in a bloodbath right now, trying"
"19713370","19722930"," to close the gap all the way down at 15.82, Apple bullish"
"19722930","19739800"," recovering, Dixie rolling over right now, IWM"
"19739800","19755330"," with the baby arm recovery into the close right now, I'm"
"19755330","19761830"," looking at some zero dates at 4.49s, I wonder if they ramp it tonight, like today during the end"
"19761830","19771740"," of the day or over the night, same setup as yesterday, like just super"
"19771740","19784710"," ramp into the bell, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, just do it all, price"

"19812110","19824170"," see any pullback in here, and"
"19824170","19834030"," if you see green bars pop off it, start buying that bad boy right"
"19834030","19841610"," up, any of that stuff down here, I think currently that price is at, so I'll put your gray bar"
"19841610","19860330"," down there for you, you can see it right there, it's actually higher, right there, so any"
"19860330","19865570"," kind of weakness into this bell, that's that gray bar that I moved for you, so right in here, any"
"19865570","19871650"," kind of weakness in here, you just buy it, if you see green come off it, it's like red come"
"19871650","19875970"," down and then green start coming off it, enter adds to your position, whatever you're going to do,"
"19883480","19893580"," I might add some zero dates or one dates to any kind of weakness down here for tomorrow, four"

"19903330","19909930"," 58 cents right now for four fifties for tomorrow, now switching, I've got Friday calls and I'm"
"19909930","19923830"," switching to one dates, no,"

"20030710","20038830"," I don't think that'll happen but you see 459 like Friday clothes like right at 430, that'd be"
"20038830","20052570"," insane, that'd be insane, that'd be great, just"
"20052570","20062350"," to race the entire move by Friday, spicy, you get in the crisscross right now you see it right,"
"20063050","20069290"," watch 905 again that crisscross right now, it's getting, it's getting spicy guaranteed, if you"
"20069290","20073290"," pissed off bears out there, pissed off sellers right now, they're gonna get really angry and slam"

"20138920","20145880"," money selling, we had lots of hedging come out, that's about it, but no continuation of that, I"
"20145880","20152320"," explained it to Binky one night, in a, explain it to Binky one night, we're having a talk last"
"20152320","20160450"," weekend about the impacts and the effects of dealers chasing when dealers are in the market, how"
"20160450","20170880"," they impact the market, how dealers get run over by real money buying and selling, no"
"20170880","20177160"," continuation of that though, real money selling, no continuation of chasing by dealers amplifying"
"20177160","20179500"," the downside move, and not"
"20179500","20190200"," so"
"20199870","20209390"," bad oh yeah, new high on spoos, they're not gonna give me those one dates are they,"
"20209610","20223460"," they're just gonna rip it, what are you doing Bob, this is highly irregular, Bob's"
"20223460","20238910"," bosses are calling all like Moody's, come up to the cost for a downgrade, oh"
"20238910","20248910"," yeah, NDX wants to fuck around and find out too, NDX wants to"
"20248910","20258690"," destroy right now, so 5 minute chart here on NASDAQ, if I see that right there, you want to see"
"20258690","20258830"," it?"
"20260010","20272850"," hold on a second here, if you want to see it better, NASDAQ making another attempt right now sold"
"20272850","20283230"," once, sold twice, sold three times, what's changed here, do you know, velocity"
"20285070","20289830"," So velocity is like coming up from underneath and saying, no, no, no, they're going to get trapped"
"20289830","20290210"," in here. "
"20290250","20293330"," We're going to close that, and we're going to likely close that, too."
"20294810","20296670"," The velocity is changing right now."
"20296750","20298610"," It's very negative right now. "
"20298670","20301990"," The more negative velocity becomes so, so let me explain it a better way to you."
"20303230","20306870"," Velocity is plus 100, okay?"
"20310310","20314390"," Velocity is now plus 50, got it?"
"20316930","20318250"," Velocity now is zero."
"20320250","20323790"," Velocity now minus 25, you know what I'm saying?"
"20325510","20327350"," Minus 50 down here, right?"
"20328430","20333110"," You're like taking the money and running, coming back down here and swooping down. "
"20333390","20337010"," So even if you get this and then that, and then that doesn't matter."
"20337950","20341570"," One, two, three down moves, three bar played for the Bears."
"20346330","20355390"," Busch, busch, busch, busch, busch. "
"20360070","20370050"," Bulls need to hold 447, 74 as we squeeze higher and try to"
"20370050","20372790"," take out the PT of 40, 50, 69."
"20374470","20376130"," Couple other notes here."
"20377330","20383530"," We're going to look for a rejection up here and a retest. "
"20383530","20388550"," You must, if you're a bull, hold this retest."
"20389250","20394790"," If you do not hold this retest, we are not going back up there to take out the rest of"
"20394790","20394910"," it."
"20395710","20398410"," So we're not done here, two steps ahead of you. "
"20399710","20401790"," Trade it up, fail it."
"20403450","20405870"," Right, come back down here, test that red line."
"20407570","20410550"," Test that 448, 40, then smash above. "
"20412710","20420310"," 450, and right now you've got a bunch of Velo underneath you to do it."
"20423630","20426070"," Price target end of the week, 455 right now."
"20427810","20433670"," Now you need to see the, you still need to see the pullback and the slam into the hourly and"
"20433670","20435290"," the hold of that to be valid. "
"20436650","20439170"," Velo's saying that it is going there, so we'll see."
"20448540","20451560"," 450s for tomorrow, printing 64 cents right now."
"20460340","20462120"," Remember, we're going to crash this one, right?"
"20465710","20470170"," Remember the great crash of August 8th, 2023. "
"20475560","20480840"," Remember the greatest crash of 2023, August 8th, 2023."
"20481680","20485920"," Smash that up there, clear out all these bears, burn all their puts."
"20491260","20493080"," Bulls are like, I'm well-hedged, I don't need to. "
"20494060","20495480"," I don't need to buy any more puts."
"20501790","20514010"," I love it, I do"
"20514010","20518390"," see it, that's my price target Chase, that's my price target brother."
"20519850","20525330"," That's my price target, 4650, 4650 on spy, higher on SPX. "
"20526610","20534360"," SPX the target is like 4720 or something, spy target is 456."
"20534840","20539400"," I got it up here, this is the target."
"20539910","20546980"," The target is, I don't even believe this, right here, that's my target. "
"20547840","20550740"," On spy, 4650, 4660."
"20552170","20563000"," In this quarter, higher two is possible in this quarter, in"
"20563000","20563460"," this quarter."
"20565230","20572940"," And for it to hold, and then start September and tag that 480, maybe December. "
"20573580","20581840"," I'd really like to see like, what I'd like to see is like 465 on this quarter, higher than that."
"20582560","20584440"," Another 25 to 50 points higher than that."
"20585100","20592560"," And then I'd like to see a pullback, a nice pullback that'll get us to 480 by end of year,"
"20592800","20593620"," January 1."
"20596030","20601330"," Maybe afterwards could be January 30th on the late side of that. "
"20603370","20607770"," And then I'd like to see a pullback into February, or if that started in like first week of"
"20607770","20608190"," January."
"20608490","20616840"," My assumption there would be, you get people on CNBC saying, buy all this spec growth, just like it"
"20616840","20617400"," did two years ago."
"20618920","20621760"," And they'll sell into, you know, into February. "
"20622140","20625480"," We're gonna get a major role in February, January, February, major role."
"20626140","20628380"," We're gonna come back down and test that trough."
"20630080","20632040"," Now fucking trough is gonna get tested. "
"20632420","20638400"," And I think that's where, if you're the bear looking for the second leg down, that's where you're"
"20638400","20641320"," gonna, you're gonna get it then, if it's, if it happens."
"20643060","20646940"," So January, February, you'd be looking for that second leg down."
"20647520","20655420"," If that how, if you're, if your thesis is the market's gonna crash, sometime between January 1 and"
"20655420","20658840"," February 28th would be your window for that. "
"20672170","20678750"," I'm still on this market with several, I don't know if it's several hundred right now, but several"
"20678750","20680310"," hundred thousand dollars in market."
"20680690","20681830"," So that's my thesis."
"20684430","20685410"," Unless some changes. "
"20687210","20690730"," Even with the correction, I'm gonna stay in that market for that thesis."
"20691130","20694930"," Matter of fact, we could trade a 425 and I still think that thesis is strong."
"20697740","20699560"," So I still think that thesis is good. "
"20701200","20707090"," I need to see a fundamental shift in the market, fear in the market."
"20708310","20709750"," And I want to see exuberance too."
"20710470","20712030"," And I still haven't seen exuberance. "
"20713610","20718090"," Like I don't think for 456's exuberance yet."
"20719070","20725250"," Exuberance is like when you, when you fail all-time highs, like you're coming in all-time highs and"
"20727670","20730350"," people are screaming that we're gonna go to all-time highs."
"20730350","20731750"," Like that would be a trigger for me. "
"20732110","20733130"," Like ex of the market there."
"20734750","20739670"," Maybe like weekly traded up to all the actual all-time highs with weeklies or something."
"20743210","20744430"," Like just exuberance. "
"20746910","20752790"," And then I think you switch it in between that period to the actual all-time highs."
"20753870","20760870"," They unload into buyers and then as they roll the market over as a whole, I think you're gonna have"
"20760870","20765550"," a lot of bulls being like, we're gonna have 5,000 next."
"20765850","20768190"," And right when they're saying that, I'm gonna be like, fuck that, I'm out of here. "
"20771180","20773520"," I'm gonna check the five minute here, see if I can add to my position."
"20774460","20775120"," Right in here."
"20775560","20776380"," So just right here. "
"20777300","20779600"," Tap wants to buy with one dates down in here."
"20780280","20781420"," Just right there, you can see it."
"20801110","20803190"," I'm gonna leave it on this five minutes so you can see it here. "
"20810510","20811930"," Here's the reversal right here."
"20814620","20815880"," Right there and right there."
"20818590","20819650"," I want to see that get bought. "
"20838750","20839670"," Good job on XLU."
"20847850","20849010"," I don't see the equal."
"20849550","20854230"," Normally like, so I want to like what I'm looking for here is like, I'll show it to you guys"
"20854230","20854590"," right now. "
"20871140","20873820"," What I don't want to see is like, I'll show it to you later."
"20874000","20875260"," I'm not gonna bring it right now."
"20875380","20878960"," It's like what I don't want to see is the daily valo start to break negative. "
"20883190","20885210"," And I'm not seeing that yet on daily."
"20885570","20892150"," So I want to see like that stuff start turning negative."
"20892270","20893470"," I start seeing that stuff turning negative. "
"20894110","20895030"," I'm gonna get scared."
"20895590","20897990"," I'll get scared with you, Chase."
"20898230","20905990"," But if I start seeing that daily valo rolling over, I start seeing those triggers roll over like"
"20905990","20907530"," daily triggers, that kind of stuff. "
"20908230","20908990"," I'm gonna get scared."
"20912950","20914530"," I'm not seeing them roll over right now."
"20914670","20916290"," So I'm not scared yet. "
"20919720","20922880"," Now if they do begin to roll over, I'm gonna get fucking scared."
"20929310","20937950"," Like really scared on a five minute chart right here."
"20953270","20954310"," Yeah, I have all kinds of rules. "
"20955330","20956030"," I've got a ton of them."
"20956170","20958070"," A lot of them, a lot of them matter."
"20958070","20963630"," Or something like the rules, but you break them depending upon other conditions. "
"20965630","20967090"," One of my hard and fast rules."
"20967410","20968550"," I have a day trading account."
"20968690","20969930"," I have a swing trading account. "
"20970050","20971110"," I have an investment account."
"20972610","20973470"," I keep that money separate."
"20973750","20976130"," Another hard rule is I remove money from the stock market. "
"20977170","20983450"," I try to put it into right now, it's all housing or improving that housing they own."
"20983870","20985770"," So like five makes remove some money."
"20986130","20990870"," Let's put a roof on this house or it's a nice new bathroom in it or something like that. "
"20992570","20993330"," That kind of stuff."
"20998000","21000920"," Like the point of the market is to make money, but then it's also to remove it."
"21000980","21001720"," It's a big part of it. "
"21003480","21005040"," And don't be too fearful of that."
"21005300","21008660"," You know like when I remove money from the market, I don't get this feeling of I need to spend"
"21008660","21009260"," it all either."
"21009560","21013520"," You think you'll have that feeling, but you don't. "
"21013580","21014600"," So you don't actually spend it."
"21014700","21016140"," You think about all the things like it's weird."
"21016760","21018460"," I don't know if you guys know this or not. "
"21018460","21020120"," I feel like a new trader, a new investor."
"21021780","21023860"," There's a little bit of like I'm going to piss the money away."
"21024920","21029440"," But if you start making money, you're going to like dream of all these things that you're going to"
"21029440","21029920"," spend it on. "
"21030780","21032280"," And then you're not going to spend it."
"21034140","21036920"," And I had warned you not to leave it in your account to trade."
"21037120","21042060"," I would warn you to take it out and put it towards something that can fund you to continue to"
"21042060","21042260"," trade. "
"21042580","21043660"," Put it in an appreciating asset."
"21043660","21048460"," I do hear people say things like real estate is risky."
"21048800","21049380"," It is risky. "
"21050240","21053260"," But work within your means and always look for a deal."
"21053620","21054880"," Like a deal matters."
"21055800","21060960"," Treat real estate a lot different than, so as a matter of fact, I tipped somebody last night. "
"21062420","21064120"," And I didn't get a great deal."
"21064760","21068180"," But I got great service and all those things and I wasn't cheap, right?"
"21069320","21070760"," I was like tip really heavy and hard."
"21070760","21079540"," And you know, like, there are times though that you have to be cheap. "
"21080040","21081940"," And when you're putting money to work for yourself."
"21084780","21086380"," And it's not that you can't do it either."
"21086600","21087260"," You just ask people. "
"21087800","21092560"," Like as far as you, if you're not even there yet, start to get to know someone that owns one"
"21092560","21095700"," or two or three houses or a vacation home, something like that."
"21097000","21098560"," And ask tons of questions."
"21099080","21102820"," And then when you hit it big enough, buy a piece of real estate. "
"21104540","21106300"," Especially if it's going to be a rental of any kind."
"21107840","21109840"," You're not going to care how much it costs you."
"21109920","21110420"," You're not going to care. "
"21110900","21112080"," Now there's a bunch of pitfalls in there."
"21113500","21114480"," It needs to be cheap."
"21114960","21116620"," Like you have to find it cheap. "
"21116880","21118380"," You have to do the work yourself."
"21119920","21123520"," So that it doesn't matter what happens in the housing market."
"21125380","21127160"," And that its use is clear, right?"
"21127600","21128780"," That it's there to make you money. "
"21146140","21149940"," Like putting the money work to you for you is like, there's nothing like it."
"21150980","21151900"," There's nothing like it."
"21152040","21157020"," No matter how you do it, I don't care if it's like buying, I don't care if it's buying playing"
"21157020","21161040"," cards or buying a laundry mat or a storage unit. "
"21161200","21162040"," I don't care what it is."
"21164280","21165100"," There's a need for that."
"21165240","21166820"," Some people don't have laundry machines, right?"
"21167120","21168120"," Some people don't have houses. "
"21171230","21172310"," So I don't care what it is."
"21172430","21173450"," You're getting diamonds, gold."
"21173990","21174710"," I don't care what you're buying. "
"21176370","21178130"," Something that appreciates over time."
"21178130","21181950"," It's going to bring you money that you don't have to do anything for or not a lot for."
"21187420","21187860"," Yeah. "
"21188080","21192420"," Silver people versus it's funny because I'm looking for a silver right now, actively."
"21193920","21197920"," And I've been looking for one now for six months, maybe nine months."
"21201500","21202900"," And I'm so cheap. "
"21203080","21203560"," That's another one."
"21203620","21208580"," So that's a good one too because the market hasn't come down."
"21209560","21212720"," And unlike a house, like, well, let's compare that to a house. "
"21212720","21218020"," So I've been looking at houses as well and we're going to auctions."
"21219120","21221840"," Now, matter of fact, last week, I went to auctions last week."
"21222060","21223820"," Yeah, I think last week I went to auctions last week. "
"21223880","21230780"," I look forward to a couple of auctions and early marks on close imbalance, currently sitting at 179"
"21230780","21232520"," million to the sell side."
"21232880","21236480"," I might not get like the house price."
"21236760","21239760"," Like I'm getting it though, cheap still and I have to renovate them, right?"
"21242000","21246420"," And I have to renovate them, but I'm not going to buy like what I'm not going to do is"
"21246420","21252960"," go out to buy a house that market value already renovated because you don't know what they did. "
"21252960","21257180"," If they get it right or wrong, they scam, they scam renovated their house."
"21257600","21260620"," Like some guy and his wife that's like, oh, I'm going to change up my bathroom."
"21261680","21264340"," You know, I'm not buying that house for any amount of money. "
"21266620","21276290"," Some guy that put, I don't know, fucking plastic boards down and called it done"
"21277130","21279330"," for their living room or dining room."
"21279730","21283150"," Dogs run across it, no offense if you have that in your house."
"21286430","21296150"," But you know, sailboats is a good one because now how do I look at sailboats differently?"
"21296710","21303510"," Like sailboats, I'm like, well, I don't really want to do, I don't want to buy a $30,000 boat"
"21303510","21305990"," and have to put another $150,000 into it. "
"21309430","21311070"," I don't want a boat that's ready to go."
"21312010","21314130"," I don't want to spend my time working on a boat, I don't."
"21317260","21321800"," Now saying that, I don't want to work on a sailboat. "
"21323000","21329400"," I also know that sailboat markets likely going to come crashing down next year or two."
"21329560","21332560"," Now, I've been saying that for two years though, and it has not come down."
"21334020","21336360"," But way more volatile than the housing market. "
"21337040","21339180"," Way more volatile than the housing market."
"21339360","21345180"," If you think the housing market's volatile boat market will just get destroyed."
"21345580","21349020"," If we get hurricanes this season, I might consider one of those boats. "
"21350100","21355740"," I'm trading 448 right now, so we have 44880 bulls."
"21356680","21360940"," Did I even let it come down here for me to buy a dip and add some more calls down"
"21360940","21361160"," here?"
"21361600","21362700"," It's a matter with you."
"21365480","21367280"," How's your weekly is doing right now?"
"21367420","21368080"," They doing okay?"
"21368640","21371920"," How's your weekly calls for Friday doing right now?"
"21372680","21373300"," Are they okay?"
"21383610","21384590"," Are they printing?"
"21399120","21399860"," They are. "
"21404490","21405310"," They're okay."
"21405890","21407310"," I wish I had zero dates, Dad."
"21407930","21411070"," I wanted to crank out some methane of the clothes. "
"21415550","21419730"," Dad's weekly is around 5%, everybody else is up 100% right now and zero dates."
"21432660","21433880"," And is this even real buying?"
"21433880","21435600"," It's real buying, the guarantee it is."
"21437180","21438100"," Guarantee this real buying. "
"21439340","21441520"," Trading 448 and change, baby."
"21443970","21450330"," Give me that $4.5069. Hunter buying into clothes."
"21452410","21457870"," Like to like, like boat some like, I'm like, yeah, you know, like that boat ain't ever bringing me"
"21457870","21458030"," money. "
"21459610","21465350"," Like that boat's never going to never get like, oh, well, you can do, I guess I could do charters"
"21465350","21466950"," get a license and chart of the boat."
"21467810","21468410"," But I'm working."
"21468790","21469410"," I don't want to work. "
"21472570","21473370"," You know what I mean?"
"21473670","21475830"," So I'm like, yeah, I don't like boat market."
"21477010","21478450"," That boat market can get volatile."
"21483080","21484420"," Oh, yeah, let me get the wall of worry music. "
"21484420","21484820"," Hold on."
"21484940","21486300"," Wall of worry climbing the wall of worry."
"21486340","21486840"," Hold on here. "
"21489920","21493280"," What is that one?"
"21501490","21504130"," Who's climbing the wall of worry?"
"21507680","21510860"," Yeah, both slips can appreciate both slips are no joke."
"21513410","21514810"," Both slips are no joke."
"21516290","21517110"," Who said that?"
"21518890","21521050"," Good friend of mine was asked to be able to buy in a boat yard. "
"21522410","21522810"," Seriously."
"21525390","21527230"," I'm like, why do I want a fucking boat yard?"
"21527330","21528570"," I just want to be on the water, man."
"21530810","21532770"," Climb the wall of worry, baby. "
"21532770","21533590"," Don't cry."
"21538680","21539940"," Climb the wall of worry."
"21558050","21559530"," Yeah, the boat slips are not cheap. "
"21560390","21562910"," Squeeze and hire now climbing the wall of worry, baby."
"21567530","21568890"," Yeah, tours are good too."
"21569010","21569470"," That's good money. "
"21578170","21578950"," You got it, Casey."
"21580770","21583890"," Trading 449 and 18 right now, boys and girls."
"21584230","21584590"," Where are we going?"
"21590210","21590990"," What are we doing?"
"21591350","21592170"," What's going on here?"
"21592910","21593730"," The hell is that?"
"21607880","21610940"," Climbing the wall of worry now, trading 449, 19. "
"21615350","21619760"," I think we're going to 455."
"21620420","21621760"," We're going to bounce around a little bit though."
"21622240","21625100"," We're going to bounce around a little bit to get there. "
"21627740","21629280"," Thanking to let it happen for easy."
"21631220","21634200"," You need it to be something like this here."
"21634300","21634540"," Are you ready?"
"21637400","21639820"," Yeah, something like this right here. "
"21641600","21643420"," Something like that right there."
"21644260","21647200"," You're going to need this green bar right here."
"21648040","21652680"," To march up, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump, dump. "
"21653480","21655680"," That hourly gets underneath there and that's it."
"21655720","21656280"," It's all over."
"21656460","21658540"," That hourly is going to push us right above that 451. "
"21659180","21661560"," We'll start tracking 455."
"21666670","21667370"," Moam, baby."
"21671940","21672520"," That nice. "
"21673820","21675580"," Didn't let me buy down here, did it?"
"21675820","21676720"," I'm like, I got weeklies."
"21676920","21678160"," Let me have one dates for tomorrow."
"21678560","21679980"," What are those trading right now?"
"21682760","21684500"," Those are big boys, huh?"
"21685240","21686100"," I'm trading good. "
"21720090","21722930"," Yeah, I've got, it's like boats are a weird thing."
"21723170","21727390"," I don't ever want to buy a boat that's too expensive, but I want it to be done."
"21728010","21729390"," So for me, I got to wait for the market. "
"21730270","21734310"," I got to wait for the market to present that boat."
"21734670","21739570"," The only other thing I could consider like building a boat or working on a boat, the only other"
"21739570","21745070"," thing I would consider would maybe be a hurricane boat that's a right off, that's not too much"
"21745070","21746350"," damage."
"21746850","21748690"," Then I would consider a catamaran. "
"21749390","21753310"," Right now I want a um, it depends."
"21753710","21762630"," I'm having this, I'm having this, get it down to like a 50 foot monohull or like a 38 or"
"21762630","21763770"," a couple of specific brands."
"21765990","21772110"," I want the catamaran, but I don't want a low haul catamaran. "
"21773950","21775730"," If I'm going to be crossing any kind of oceans."
"21776410","21783390"," So I wouldn't mind the low haul catamaran, if I was just staying, guess I could do that."
"21783650","21785170"," I could do that if I sold it. "
"21786490","21792850"," I feel like sold it in Florida, and then maybe went to the Panama Canal to get a boat to"
"21792850","21793370"," cross with."
"21794730","21804190"," I don't want to cross an ocean without a kick-ass catamaran with a high haul, or we're going to"
"21804190","21806610"," go down to Panama and buy a mono haul to cross the ocean."
"21806950","21808990"," I think crossing the ocean mono haul is the only way. "
"21812320","21813640"," Marine canvas is big money."
"21815300","21816180"," Big money."
"21819310","21821010"," Aluminum welding, big money. "
"21823520","21827080"," I think kind of welding, like if you're a welder, if you ever want to go sailing around the world,"
"21828560","21833560"," pretty much like three things you could learn and three or four things and make a lot of money."
"21834440","21839240"," Like any kind of diesel repair, you could just travel and get paid on your own boat."
"21841000","21844460"," People would pay you all around the world, other sailors. "
"21845340","21846320"," Now, you're not supposed to."
"21846380","21851280"," It's illegal to get paid to do that, but you can make some serious money."
"21851520","21851780"," Air conditioning. "
"21853100","21857140"," If you're like a master with air conditioning, you're going to have a lot of friends."
"21857320","21858620"," You're going to have women falling all over you."
"21864830","21865710"," Now, what's another one?"
"21866130","21870570"," Cell making, canvas repair, canvas building, anything with canvas. "
"21871150","21872270"," Any kind of canvas work."
"21872270","21874610"," Trading 449-21 right now."
"21876010","21877090"," Extreme bullishness. "
"21884200","21886100"," A whole bunch of stops up there."
"21886220","21886880"," We're going to take out."
"21887960","21889080"," A whole bunch. "
"21896450","21898110"," The, what else is a good one?"
"21899850","21902690"," Like money, a welder."
"21903110","21903670"," Any kind of welding."
"21904850","21913470"," The other stuff is kind of easy, like the repair stuff and painting and sanding and epoxy work. "
"21913690","21921150"," I guess some people would disagree with that with the epoxy work, but the big ones are like"
"21921150","21924050"," refrigeration, AC refrigeration, that kind of stuff."
"21931030","21932490"," Oh yeah, nobody flinches, dude."
"21932850","21937570"," Like I'm telling you what, if you have those trades and you're around sailors or boat power"
"21937570","21942890"," butters, most of those trades, you're worth your weight in gold, especially if you're good at it. "
"21943430","21947990"," I feel like every time it's done and it didn't cost much, you make some bank."
"21960000","21961040"," Yeah, lithium batteries."
"21961680","21969300"," More dangerous, but you can, you know, you can grind them straight down and buy lithium batteries"
"21969300","21969720"," off eBay. "
"21974150","21976830"," I've done that before, brown bear or a bear town sheriff."
"21977850","21981550"," I've got finger trades for big money."
"21983230","21984210"," I have done that. "
"21990330","21994390"," I got a, I didn't tell you guys this yesterday, or maybe I did tell you guys yesterday."
"21994670","21997570"," I got assigned or not assigned."
"21997910","22003770"," Well, they closed my, they didn't get quite an assigned, but just like a, just like closing a"
"22003770","22008170"," spread, I didn't close calls last week, let them go to expiry. "
"22008530","22013090"," And after 415, they assigned them to me at zero cents instead of the 12 that I was owed."
"22013290","22014170"," I was fucking pissed."
"22015430","22017490"," I was fucking living on that. "
"22020290","22021470"," That finger and trade sucks."
"22023110","22031050"," I've done that on big trades, like going against me, like, like, we're going down and I'm buying"
"22031050","22040580"," calls, not intentionally, like boom calls and then, marine electronics, another big one that's, so"
"22040580","22041960"," I should have said that, electrician."
"22042900","22044580"," If you hit, that would be the last one. "
"22044800","22053820"," If you're an electrician with an eye to electronic side of things, of huge money, like DC wiring,"
"22053820","22057380"," if you have a base under, good base understanding of DC wiring, and you have a good understanding"
"22057380","22058200"," of electronics."
"22059660","22065040"," It was like different fields you can go into with, with a, being electrician, but if you go to that"
"22065040","22068260"," field, you don't even need to work."
"22068320","22069240"," You're just going to start sailing. "
"22069580","22071500"," Everywhere you go, someone's going to have work for you."
"22076250","22077810"," Yeah, I was pretty pissed off that happened."
"22078350","22079470"," I was pretty upset about that. "
"22080650","22084130"," So now I'll never not, not close a call or a put on expiry."
"22089070","22090810"," I was a big, I didn't think that could happen."
"22091410","22092070"," And it can. "
"22092810","22106090"," I was like, okay, people"
"22106090","22106850"," on grind and spy."
"22110790","22112410"," Let's take a look at that five minute chart."

"22634240","22635740"," You wanted to get really sexy with it."
"22645090","22645570"," 2725. "
"22646170","22647010"," I don't know if you get up there."
"22651590","22652730"," I just watched a."
"22654070","22654970"," Was that Rivian?"
"22655170","22657650"," I think I just watched a video on a thing that was Rivian."
"22657970","22661650"," They were they were back country forewilling in Utah. "
"22662010","22662670"," It was a pretty cool video."
"22670650","22671830"," Yeah, exactly Matthew."
"22672190","22672950"," Hopefully never scoring. "
"22673350","22674130"," I told her that too."
"22674250","22675410"," I'm like, you know, you're going to be disappointed."
"22678330","22682950"," I was like, I was like, nobody's going to treat you like I treat you. "
"22687990","22690490"," I'm like, they're probably not going to like me because of that too."
"22691290","22695810"," I used to date a lot of girls when I was younger and you know, they have like a daddy"
"22695810","22697950"," take care of them, you know, the father would take care of them."
"22699130","22701030"," You know, they'd be like, how did you get this?"
"22701170","22701730"," How'd you get that?"
"22701910","22702850"," How do you afford all this?"
"22703250","22705090"," My dad takes care of it for me. "
"22706630","22707550"," I don't need you."
"22707830","22708750"," I'm like, damn it."
"22719360","22720020"," Thanks, Nina. "
"22720180","22722140"," Nina dropping in and saying unverified earnings."
"22722140","22723440"," Second Q revs."
"22724640","22726720"," 1.12 billion. "
"22727400","22729380"," Estimated 1.01 billion."
"22731080","22731680"," That's good."
"22732300","22733080"," That's growth, right?"
"22735950","22737410"," Hey, I'm going to look at SCMI. "
"22737590","22737910"," I got you."
"22738770","22739250"," SCMI."
"22742360","22743400"," I'll take a look at that for you. "
"22743700","22744600"," Let's stick around for a minute."
"22758300","22763400"," So I don't have a ticker coming up in my book for that for S-M-C-I."
"22767930","22768930"," Oh, did I spell that wrong?"
"22769650","22770070"," Hold on. "
"22770070","22772730"," Oh, super microcomputer."
"22774950","22783150"," Super microcomputer was not bullish into this close on this one."
"22784850","22785870"," Let's bring it up for you. "
"22789360","22794680"," So let me show you guys, so when you guys have, no, hold on, let's just put it over here."
"22795480","22796300"," Let me show you guys something."
"22797260","22802860"," So when you guys are doing this on your own and stuff, you have a better idea of this. "
"22803140","22805740"," It was a fair one."
"22805960","22807660"," So coming in, so today, right?"
"22807920","22809540"," Not bullish here on this ticker."
"22810560","22817430"," I'd like to see this ticker at least pull back to 303. "
"22818270","22819430"," And I'll be honest with you."
"22820070","22821930"," It's got a little bit of stretch going on here."
"22822010","22822550"," You see that stretch?"
"22824370","22832850"," Now it's extremely bullish, but currently my buy-in on it would be like 305,"
"22833230","22836370"," but I'd really like a bigger pullback. "
"22836690","22838230"," So 305 for right now."
"22839990","22845470"," But you see what I see the difference here on this ticker and Rydian."
"22852400","22853920"," I can't see shit. "
"22855160","22857180"," Still have a still, I just received."
"22857540","22857860"," Here we go."
"22865470","22868510"," So you see that nice bounce down here in that daily trigger?"
"22869150","22870690"," I like seeing this nice pullback, right?"
"22870690","22872310"," This is all healthy for a stock, right?"
"22874150","22875850"," You want to see that nice pullback, right?"
"22875950","22876910"," Come up here, take the money. "
"22877190","22877990"," Yeah, made a bunch of money."
"22878310","22880510"," Come back down here, sitting on the daily."
"22881170","22882170"," Good place to buy, right?"
"22882530","22883410"," Not a bad place to buy. "
"22883690","22885330"," Next good place to buy right down below here."
"22886190","22888210"," But these pullbacks are healthy for a ticker."
"22888290","22889370"," They're not negative. "
"22890790","22894070"," I realize that some of you out there think they're negative, but they're not."
"22894790","22900290"," It's a matter of just taking profit and a good entry point to get long in the market."
"22900290","22902450"," You're like, when you're here, like this is Rydian, right?"
"22905810","22907650"," Like, do I want to be getting long there?"
"22907850","22913450"," No, like trying to buy stuff like this to get, you can buy this tip down here, right?"
"22914090","22915990"," But even Steven down here, pullback like this. "
"22916770","22920290"," All this consolidation down here, what we all this consolidation down here."
"22920830","22922750"," These are all trap buyers down here, right?"
"22923650","22926230"," So they've done all this trappiness over here."
"22927150","22928390"," And so you're sitting right here. "
"22928530","22932330"," You'd rather be the buyer right here than you would ever back over here."
"22932470","22932750"," It makes sense."
"22934490","22937010"," So this is a nice signpost for you, right?"
"22937230","22939410"," Here's another nice signpost for you. "
"22939890","22940850"," $20, right?"
"22940990","22942770"," So if you have Rydian bull, you're like, eh, I want to buy 20."
"22943750","22948390"," I want to buy 21 or 24.55. I want to DCA my way into Rydian."
"22949050","22949770"," So I like it. "
"22950170","22951290"," It's got good time sideways."
"22956230","22956810"," Don't win it."
"22957550","22958450"," I'm not going to leave that. "
"22958790","22959170"," Hold on here."
"22967880","22968940"," So there's Rydian."
"22969700","22972060"," We got spoos down nine cents, 11 cents. "
"22972860","22977480"," If you're looking to sell here and after hours, a little bit of space down here to sell."
"22979850","22982470"," We're going to wait to see if futures buys this or not."
"22983590","22987510"," And hopefully London doesn't sell it down on us at two in the morning. "
"22987670","22988730"," So let's be looking for that tonight."
"22988850","22989830"," I'll be awake for that as well."
"22990130","22991010"," See if they try to sell it down. "
"22991470","22992930"," This has been the setup right now, right?"
"22993070","22994450"," We go into the middle of the night and the middle of the night."
"22994570","22995770"," They're just like boom, sell it."
"23001910","23003530"," Yeah, AMC, man. "
"23003750","23005830"," I think I was bearish down to, um."
"23007490","23009170"," So like AMC, man."
"23009850","23010090"," Fuck. "
"23010750","23012250"," Is it getting hammered or no?"
"23014630","23016330"," Doesn't look like it's getting hammered right now."
"23017090","23018190"," AMC is getting hammered."
"23021650","23023170"," No, 530 sold. "
"23023710","23024050"," Damn, dude."
"23024250","23025130"," They did sell that, huh?"
"23025970","23027790"," They sold that squeeze right down here."
"23028670","23029470"," Like AMC. "
"23037020","23039580"," Like you like this kind of stuff right here, right?"
"23040740","23042100"," So here's AMC, right?"
"23045260","23047160"," You know, I like to see that daily."
"23048300","23050780"," The negative side loves trading this daily, right?"
"23051100","23051500"," Squeezing up."
"23051940","23053920"," I guess you could say it's going to keep squeezing. "
"23054640","23056120"," Maybe that's what you're talking about."
"23057240","23058340"," The bullishness that's coming."
"23061470","23063390"," I guess you're saying that you're going to get another blip. "
"23064870","23066550"," Almost tagged perfectly the monthly."
"23067770","23069430"," And you're saying when you go higher, right?"
"23069430","23071890"," I see what you're saying."
"23072090","23073870"," I get what you're saying here. "
"23075050","23076410"," That it's not done, right?"
"23078090","23080870"," That any pullback here is going to get bought and you're going to go higher?"
"23081810","23085650"," There's a couple of big things to know too about this."
"23086810","23094710"," When this does cross this daily, when this daily crosses up here, it can be extremely bullish."
"23095750","23098710"," I guess I'm discounting AMC right now. "
"23098830","23100010"," I'm saying that I'm looking for."
"23100810","23102370"," One more pullback down here."
"23103370","23110150"," Like the safe trade is like one more pullback, something like that. "
"23111670","23114390"," If you're already long down here, you're fine."
"23115030","23117590"," You can stay long here as long as you stay above 510."
"23118870","23119910"," I get what you're saying. "
"23120170","23121610"," I might take one of these trades with you."
"23123270","23124010"," This is AMC."
"23127620","23131960"," I see what you're saying. "
"23132400","23141500"," One thing that sucks up here is you need, at some point, you're going to need that daily trigger."
"23142980","23147890"," Well, I'm not bearish on."
"23147990","23150610"," I shouldn't say that I'm bearish on AMC. "
"23154800","23157840"," I should, I should, which I should say it."
"23158080","23166610"," Not bearish on AMC, but I am like you should buy it here specifically."
"23168650","23171590"," So like, I'd really like to buy that for, what is that?"
"23171870","23175550"," 478, 472 and ride that bad boy up. "
"23176850","23177990"," What is that, August?"
"23181410","23183050"," So you get something like that going on."
"23185180","23185900"," That makes sense."
"23186360","23191000"," So, um, bullish into August, uh, end of month. "
"23192300","23193660"," Price target above $9."
"23195000","23196100"," Does that help?"
"23196400","23197100"," You're watching right now."
"23198260","23199720"," AMC price target $9. "
"23200400","23200800"," End of month."
"23201280","23201640"," End of August."
"23205840","23209240"," It's a hard one to say, it's a hard one to talk to people about. "
"23210180","23215240"," What makes it difficult is, um, you can get stuck really bad."
"23215240","23222060"," And then the people that traded a lot, no offense to you if you trade it, um, I feel like"
"23222060","23224040"," they don't have enough time in market to trade it."
"23224040","23227080"," So, uh, for me, it's just a personal thing. "
"23227160","23230500"," It's not like, it's not like bad trade, AMC or anything like that."
"23230500","23236680"," But I find that those takers attract, uh, new traders that have no business trading that shit, like"
"23236680","23236980"," zero."
"23237260","23238120"," They get caught in it all the time. "
"23238220","23243020"," They can't excel, they worry, they blast down to the depths of hell, then it swings back higher."
"23243460","23245000"," Before you know, they're just burning through their accounts."
"23246320","23247960"," So I don't want to talk about it a lot. "
"23248380","23249860"," There's other guys that like to talk about it."
"23250500","23252240"," James Rowland likes to talk about AMC."
"23252820","23253980"," I trust his judge run AMC. "
"23255540","23261700"," Look at that AMC just slammed down to $4.90. Just now bam, big slam down there."
"23262340","23264500"," That's the long AMC trade right there."
"23264700","23265160"," You see it?"
"23265440","23266900"," You see it just happened just now?"
"23268880","23270160"," So you see that down there?"
"23270280","23271480"," That's a big slam down there?"
"23272180","23273540"," I just said where I want to buy it, right?"
"23279980","23282300"," And it just slammed down there just now. "
"23284360","23286200"," Just taking out stops down there."
"23286460","23288480"," Bam, bam, bam, bam."
"23288480","23289980"," Looking for buyers down here. "
"23293640","23294700"," Dude, what happened with Rivian?"
"23294800","23295360"," Are they already down?"
"23297000","23298220"," Rivian, what are you doing, dude?"
"23298440","23298780"," What do you trade?"
"23299040","23299780"," Oh, they're only down a dollar."
"23300160","23300820"," They're not down at 20."
"23301040","23301520"," They're fine. "
"23302300","23303040"," Rivian's fine here."
"23305560","23307780"," If Rivian was bad, it'd be 20 bucks."
"23309380","23310720"," It's $20 on Rivian. "
"23311840","23316580"," It just looks, all this looks like is profit taken by the dip."
"23317600","23318340"," It's all it looks like here."
"23320590","23321630"," None of this looks bad to me. "
"23322170","23327110"," So yeah, it looks like it right now, doesn't it?"
"23327110","23328990"," Looks like they're buying AMC right down here."
"23329930","23331990"," I wish they could buy AMC calls down here."
"23332070","23334890"," I'd fucking buy the fuck out of AMC calls right here. "
"23334890","23335790"," The stock's finished off."
"23336110","23337050"," Like buy the fuck out of them."
"23338690","23342990"," It's September, mid-September calls on AMC, OTM. "
"23343510","23345210"," A hundred all arrive to 10 bucks."
"23345630","23349510"," Most of the declines that topped 1% Apple halted its longer."
"23349610","23351450"," It's going to $10 and ours. "
"23351870","23356650"," If you're going to, if you want to own the underlying, this is a great place down here."
"23356770","23361190"," The last expectations and a new study raised the prospect that his drug could benefit heart disease"
"23361190","23361690"," as well."
"23362650","23368410"," So bank stocks fell today as Moody's downgraded 10 small and mid-sized American lenders earlier in"
"23368410","23368710"," the day. "
"23369570","23374190"," And also last $4.79 is where I want to buy them."
"23375050","23376790"," It's trading $5 right now."
"23377110","23380870"," $4.79 would be like the place before this week is over. "
"23381250","23385310"," The bulk market will have to digest the biggest round of refunding auction since last year."
"23385310","23386150"," A little greedy here."
"23386450","23388850"," So today's 42 billion sale in the three-year notes. "
"23388890","23390010"," Like right there."
"23390130","23393150"," They expected yield in a sign that demand was stronger than anticipated."
"23394170","23395790"," Maybe we can get down there. "
"23395930","23396790"," Maybe we can get down there."
"23396910","23398290"," Maybe the old metal by spam."
"23398530","23401970"," Maybe inflation report with the USCPR coming out on Thursday this week. "
"23402350","23403550"," Investors also waited."
"23403550","23406090"," We can get it down $4.79. I'm interested."
"23406450","23411030"," So Fed Bank of Philadelphia's Harka said that the central bank may be able to see spray types"
"23411030","23413130"," firing any surprises in the economy. "
"23413130","23415390"," Yeah, but diagonal would be good too, right?"
"23415390","23417870"," They had their current elevated levels for some time."
"23418450","23423490"," Fed Harka also noted earlier that some time, probably next year, will start to bring the interest"
"23423490","23424230"," rates down."
"23424330","23425310"," Remind me of AMC tomorrow. "
"23425790","23426730"," Counts Bob Barkin."
"23426950","23428430"," I'll give you the- I can get AMC to the downside."
"23428910","23429570"," I'll buy some of that. "
"23430150","23431570"," I'm down to hold some AMC down there."
"23432450","23433610"," What's the old man owned it at?"
"23433850","23435130"," $1.50 or something or $3?"
"23436210","23439050"," I think the owner owns it at $1.50 or $3."
"23439350","23440690"," I can't remember what that story was. "
"23440870","23442810"," He admitted to it in his office, right?"
"23444330","23447430"," He's like, I own this $1.50. I don't know why it's this high."
"23447590","23450310"," I'm like, that's because you're fucking selling your own stock short."
"23451270","23452410"," Dirty old man. "
"23456470","23458010"," Let me look at TMF really quick."
"23475950","23477030"," Oh, dude, it's ready."
"23478010","23479330"," It's fucking ready again. "
"23480550","23481790"," It's ready again."
"23481950","23482790"," TMF is ready again."
"23483150","23485210"," So good shout out on that one. "
"23487830","23489090"," Hold on a second here."
