"56920","58600"," He filmed the same way today. "
"59760","63040"," Dylan, Gavin, Sue, Jeremy, RS."
"65560","69220"," I was having some technical difficulties getting on this morning."
"69540","71980"," So apologize for that no memory card. "
"74360","83180"," Good morning everybody."
"85490","86580"," Good morning everybody."
"86880","91820"," I've got Vegas, PTC, C, KK, Lucy, good morning. "
"92640","95600"," Guy on SC, Brad, good straight EV."
"96840","97560"," Hello everybody."
"99260","100460"," Yeah, what are we going to do?"
"101300","103380"," Pretend it's time we get right into it. "
"105500","107320"," I don't even know if I can turn it down."
"109060","110200"," Come on the wrong one."
"111360","111740"," Back, back. "
"112700","115100"," All right, we're going to switch it right over here."
"116420","118580"," We're going to roll right into this because we only have a few minutes."
"118880","120420"," It's already not 10 past nine. "
"120940","122360"," We're going to get into this as fast as possible."
"122460","123260"," Can good morning, Mary."
"123420","124780"," Good morning, John. "
"125240","125980"," How's it right doing?"
"127000","129000"," Yes, smash that like button, maybe Brad."
"130540","131900"," Good morning everybody."
"132320","135400"," Okay, so we're going to make this fast because we only got 20 minutes for the bell opens. "
"135460","137580"," I just want you guys to have an idea of where we are."
"138080","139180"," There is a lot to talk about."
"139980","147080"," So we're going to talk about, you know, post after all that stuff yesterday, you know, we're going"
"147080","148960"," to have an emergency being to raise rates and all that kind of bullshit. "
"148960","152160"," That's just during the pot trying to affect the market."
"152160","156700"," We'll talk about that later and what took place yesterday at individual tickers where we were in"
"156700","157040"," the market."
"157640","162140"," There were definitely some manipulation of the market yesterday and then some amplification of that"
"162140","163020"," manipulation of the market. "
"163020","165020"," So we'll get into that after the bell opens today."
"165580","167380"," I do want you to know that it is Friday, right?"
"167900","170240"," The biggest moves of the week have happened already this week."
"171120","173680"," You, I wouldn't expect that it's going to get crazy today. "
"173980","176960"," It's possible that it could at some point, but I don't think that it will."
"177460","180100"," So we'll, let's talk about what's going to happen today."
"180460","186800"," Let's look forward to next week for OPEC's and yeah, right on. "
"187060","188320"," Yeah, I wouldn't be too scared right now."
"188760","193140"," So just for this morning on the volume profile, right?"
"193620","197820"," You can see that we're getting our time and our way back up this morning."
"198200","199460"," Just be conscious of this. "
"199600","204160"," Okay, that we're coming back into the above an iceberg today."
"204460","205580"," We should be able to trade higher."
"206060","212620"," I know that there is some concern that we have some resistance above here right around 4522. "
"214380","218400"," We're gonna train sideways in here and I'll show you some other things this morning that that could"
"218400","222140"," lead some to this possibility that we just trade sideways into the close."
"222660","225620"," But we do have, we don't have a lot of resistance up high right now."
"225940","228660"," If you're looking at the the profile here, okay?"
"228980","230380"," So it's possible we have a green day today. "
"231200","236760"," Or we just trade sideways into the bell and maybe slowly trade down and off into the sunset."
"238360","239280"," But just be aware of this."
"239360","242220"," I know that a lot of people out there have a different viewpoint on what's happening today. "
"242780","247980"," Just be aware that there are not there's there's not a lot of we can trade up higher here to"
"247980","248880"," like 452."
"249240","252320"," There's not a lot of resistance for us moving up into the end of the day."
"252860","255480"," I know that's a counter to what everyone out there is saying. "
"257160","259820"," So we are going to get out of this right here."
"260240","261220"," Turn this bad boy off."
"263600","268160"," And for the Economic Connect calendar today on Friday, we don't have much 10 a.m. We have the"
"268160","270200"," University of Michigan consumer sentiment index. "
"270240","272200"," We assume that's not going to be too good, right?"
"272600","280020"," That that uh the domain street and Mary Main Street are not going to be uh happy right now."
"280160","283220"," This might actually come in good too because unemployment has gone down."
"283880","286240"," But you know what the actions are taking place in the market. "
"286480","290180"," The cost of goods, cost of services out there, they're probably concerned."
"291520","293980"," Now next week we're not looking for anything on Monday, right?"
"294080","295120"," We've got nothing going on on Monday."
"295480","297140"," That's a good good sign for the market. "
"297500","299680"," All the bad news, all the dirty laundry is out right now."
"300100","301920"," Some Monday could shave up to be a pretty good day."
"302380","302600"," Choose. "
"302760","304460"," We've got a producer price index."
"304740","305220"," That's a big one."
"306400","308240"," Manufacturing index is a big one on Tuesday. "
"308620","310300"," I think we got a better last week."
"310400","313940"," We got a we got a pretty decent manufacturing index numbers."
"314040","318840"," Last time we had those retail sales should add should add some volatility on Wednesday. "
"319200","321760"," And then of course we've got the doom next week on Wednesday."
"321760","322680"," A plan for this, right?"
"323260","324580"," FOMC meeting minutes, right?"
"324700","329920"," You know, you're going to hear all kinds of nonsense chatter on social media and the news about"
"329920","332980"," what's going to take place on the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday."
"333720","338560"," Big news also on Thursday would be the initial jobless claims, continuing claims. "
"338980","340780"," We're going to expect these to be good numbers though."
"341520","344980"," And then the big event next week is of course going to be the monthly OPEC's."
"345340","348340"," Now the spot gamma report here, we'll go through this briefly. "
"349120","352440"," If you just had a head fairly volatile session yesterday, currently sits there."
"352540","355360"," 4, 4, 7, 5, which is off its lows."
"355680","361240"," Our anticipated models predict a very volatile day with an SG implied move of 1.9%. That's pretty"
"361240","361780"," big, right?"
"362410","363380"," Pretty volatile day. "
"363860","367040"," So we don't have a lot of resistance above, although they say that we do."
"367600","371960"," So we're either going to start selling heavy and hard today, or I think we're going to trade much,"
"372020","372460"," much higher."
"373720","376080"," Resistance lies at 4,500 and 4530. "
"376400","379080"," Support is at 4464 and 4404."
"379720","383040"," The updated shut data shows some fairly large propositions added to the S&P."
"383660","385100"," Less are equal to 4400. "
"385580","390160"," It was clearing our hero data intraday delta measurement that put buyers were out in the QQQs as"
"390160","390340"," well."
"390760","392120"," Some of this flow is clearly short dated."
"392900","399760"," And as we now measure less or equal to 20% of the SPX and QQs gamma expiring today. "
"400700","402380"," If selling increases this morning, right?"
"402460","404000"," So we're going to look for that at 930."
"404100","408720"," Our model seems to show a 4400 as support area for today below we show equity hub model, which"
"408720","410560"," shows a note of gamma at 4400."
"410840","414640"," And past instances of weak markets, these nodes have shown to be linked to support areas. "
"417680","422520"," We are less than or equal to 340, which suggests that the rate of gamma hedges decreases, declining"
"422520","423400"," negative gamma pressure."
"424060","427300"," Looking out past a few sessions, it appears a break of 4350."
"427660","429780"," Area implies a test of 4,200. "
"430260","433980"," In all actuality, if we retest that 4,200, we're more than likely going lower."
"434980","435980"," We'll need that for confirmation."
"436340","440720"," But if we do get there, you can go back to retargeting those 390s and 400s. "
"440880","443420"," There is hedging out there for 390."
"443460","444900"," That's been laid on for May."
"444900","447500"," So just be aware of that, that there was re-hedging. "
"447700","451480"," We've talked about this, like Nazim, even though the market was showing us something different for"
"451480","452240"," the past week, right?"
"452520","453980"," The banks did not sell their hedging."
"454660","456840"," They've just been rolling them out farther and farther."
"457220","458740"," And they don't want you to hold puts, right?"
"458880","459660"," They don't want you to make money. "
"460440","467840"," To the upside, that we anticipate resistance in the 4535 to 4550 area, which is"
"467840","476800"," where our 4550 calls puts yesterday."
"477880","482480"," New call position just right at strikes above or unsurprisingly light suggesting that flows will"
"482480","486720"," continue to be driven by the shifts around puts being bought, negative and delta demand and sold,"
"487240","491440"," positive, delta demand lifts from the selling of implied volatility, but likely be quick but"
"491440","491700"," violent."
"492540","495220"," IE, high volatility of volatility. "
"495820","502700"," It seems unlikely to imply volatility, but risk at 2021 lows until interest rate issues that"
"502700","503280"," cleared up."
"504080","508880"," Okay, so they're basically saying until we get a clear direction from the Fed, we're going to be"
"508880","509100"," volatile."
"509980","513960"," Close back of the of the vol-triga level shifts, fall back into the bull's court. "
"514380","518039"," With 4600, the major overhead target for early next week, right?"
"518140","518919"," So we have to be aware of that."
"519620","523940"," Now I did do, I'm going to scroll through this briefly if you want to come back and look at"
"523940","524760"," some levels or whatever."
"525380","527760"," I'll scroll through this and come back and pause this this morning. "
"529040","532760"," You can pause this video at any point and I get what you need from it."
"532880","537260"," I am going to interpret it for you this morning slightly different than how I describe it to you"
"537260","537520"," every day."
"537800","540540"," I'm not going to interpret it verbally at this moment. "
"540740","542120"," What I'm going to show you is a couple things."
"542620","543460"," You can use anything you want."
"543660","548780"," Swaggy socks is not really the most accurate, but for expiry today, there's this little window in"
"548780","549200"," here, okay?"
"549580","553080"," This little window between 452 and 455, right?"
"553660","557920"," So the question becomes, do they begin to print puts down here at this 449. "
"558460","561400"," I'm going to assume that these are some new puts that were put on yesterday."
"562020","566340"," Who are they going to print some of these calls that are now worthless here above, okay?"
"566640","568420"," I'm going to give it to the bulls today, believe it or not."
"568800","569500"," That's what I'm going to do. "
"569580","570180"," I'm going to give it to the bulls."
"570460","573180"," We could trade the other way and we'll look for how it trades off the bell."
"573620","575300"," But I'm going to give it to the bulls today, believe it or not. "
"575400","577040"," They're not going to want to print these puts down here."
"577120","581140"," They want to let these expire and not print these out because these have been killed at this point,"
"581140","581360"," right?"
"582780","584920"," Unless more puts come into the market this morning."
"585620","587100"," So that would be the next question. "
"587100","589120"," Do they bring more puts into the market?"
"589280","594980"," Now on that spot gamma, on that spot gamma report, I just made a simple chart today for you guys"
"594980","598120"," that basically this is the interpretation of that chart."
"598500","599780"," We're opening up here resistance."
"600300","601860"," The first resistance is right here. "
"602140","603740"," Let me bring this out a little bit for you guys."
"603960","605620"," Let's see what I'm talking about here, okay?"
"606000","606900"," Try to make this very simple."
"607300","611040"," Get this major downward trend, right?"
"611220","612320"," This is major resistance. "
"612480","613480"," We know this is major resistance."
"614080","617520"," We know that we traded above it, pushed above it in the overnight."
"618040","622460"," And then we know that we had mass market manipulation yesterday that sold this market down. "
"623020","625440"," And it's probably, there's two sides to it, right?"
"625700","627140"," There's profit taking going on."
"627640","631820"," And then some people know there's profit taking going on so that they know the bulls that bought"
"631820","633400"," down here on our hair trigger."
"634020","638020"," And so they can manipulate the market to start for selling and they can make money on the downside"
"638020","638820"," move, right?"
"639320","642560"," Then we know that plug market players understand this as we trade down. "
"643020","644820"," So I want you to see this big line right here, right?"
"645180","647360"," And then we're going to come back over here."
"648120","650340"," This is the spot gamma report, okay?"
"651020","651500"," Hold on here."
"651820","652560"," Get this back for it. "
"653200","658020"," Well, you guys, to focus on something important here, okay?"
"658380","662500"," And that would be that your trading range at this point, this is your R3 up here."
"663000","664760"," This is R2, your volatility trigger."
"665200","670100"," If you trade above this area, right, this volatility trigger, you're going to be looking for higher"
"670100","671400"," prices, 4600. "
"672080","677260"," If we trade up here today and hit this volatility trigger, you're going to expect a rejection of"
"677260","677960"," some kind, right?"
"678460","682080"," Your first area of support from the spot gamma report is S1 right here."
"682420","685400"," And then your second layer of support is down here at S2."
"685780","689120"," This is the rest of that triangle that we're in right down here at S2. "
"689600","691660"," And you're going to expect us to bounce off here."
"692080","695760"," So you're going to be, you're going to be looking for off the bell at 930, right?"
"696040","700120"," Are we going to, are we going to shoot straight up here and reject down and grab some support here"
"700120","701100"," at S1 or S2?"
"701360","702960"," Because this is set up right now."
"703440","706960"," This is set up right now for the bears going to be looking for it. "
"707520","711160"," They're going to be like, oh, yeah, let's cut our, let's cut our shorts loose, right?"
"711420","713960"," And then grab them again and trade it right back down to S2."
"714880","721160"," If we break this here, right, we break this 435, we're going to, we're definitely testing 4200."
"722060","729300"," And we're likely going to test lower to 4,000 or 3900, especially if all this drama ensues into now"
"729300","730780"," looks like the bank's looking at May. "
"731320","738100"," So you'd retest 420, trade back up, and then trade back down all over again to 400, 390 depending"
"738100","739740"," upon how bad this volatility gets."
"740080","745380"," If there's any kind of announcement that we're doing seven rate hikes, I don't think we're doing"
"745380","750280"," that, but you know, there's all kinds of crazy shit out there."
"750300","751300"," We're doing 100 BPS. "
"752020","756660"," We're doing 50 right out the gate that we're doing another, I don't know, I think right now they're"
"756660","762320"," talking about another like 100 in the next three, three sessions or whatever."
"762540","764340"," I think we have seven sessions left in the year."
"764900","769000"," So, so they are pricing this in, no matter what they're telling you out there, they are hedging all"
"769000","770100"," the way along here. "
"770380","777680"," I know that a lot of times when we're so just know that they're hedging out here."
"778060","781860"," Also note that they're hedging even deeper further in time, right?"
"781960","783540"," We've known that for at least a week now."
"783800","785060"," We were in the highs up here. "
"785560","787560"," They were buying 409s."
"787880","788640"," No, excuse me."
"788720","795960"," It was 390s and 400s on the spy in to May and they were buying 420s into March. "
"796360","798220"," They rolled it out from February to March, right?"
"798580","803180"," And of course, you've got all this bullshit in the news cycle saying that it's all retail, it's all"
"803180","806640"," retail, and I'm on Twitter going, no, it's not fucking wheat's retail."
"806880","808540"," These are banks, okay?"
"808560","809500"," And they're going to lie to you."
"809540","812020"," They don't want you to know they're positioning, okay?"
"812060","814460"," Until they're ready to spook the market like they did yesterday. "
"815340","820620"," Now, let's say we open here, we green bar it up, reverse, trade back down S1, and we're going to"
"820620","821200"," trade this up."
"821400","824520"," Let's say R2 is your first volatility trigger."
"824980","831460"," If we are able to break past R3, our next target above here, is this all-time high?"
"832040","833180"," Oh, not all-time high, excuse me. "
"834140","840980"," If we break above this, excuse me, if we break above the volatility trigger, we're going to try to"
"840980","842560"," attempt to trade back up to 460."
"843200","844360"," Now, do I think we're trading there?"
"844640","844880"," No."
"845260","847540"," I think that we're going to trade inside of this trading. "
"847880","852900"," I think we're going to be trading inside of these two areas here, right?"
"854080","855040"," I think we're trading."
"858320","859840"," I think we're trading inside this box."
"860120","863840"," This yellow and this yellow right here, 440 and 455. "
"864020","865300"," I think we're trading in here."
"865860","871380"," I think we could possibly swing low down here at some point, possibly swing out above here at this"
"871380","871660"," point."
"872120","874820"," This is looking like a bear flag, right?"
"875140","879440"," On a larger time frame, that shows us that one, two, and three downward move at the corrective"
"879440","879780"," movement. "
"880340","884840"," I know the bears are saying that that's going on, but even inside of this, if we trade down here,"
"885040","885060"," right?"
"885260","885640"," Swoop down."
"886140","889880"," This can set us up for move to 460 easily, okay?"
"889880","892400"," So we're still moving up in the overall sense of things."
"892400","896960"," Even though this looks like a bear flag, we're still within this upward pattern here, okay?"
"897060","899960"," So if we swoop down here, find maybe a Monday, there's no news. "
"900180","903820"," We start trading up to 460 into Monday, Tuesday of next week."
"903920","904940"," I wouldn't be shocked, okay?"
"905280","907700"," And then we trail off maybe down into OPEC's."
"909520","912160"," I think that's all I've got for you for the open this morning. "
"912760","915280"," I've got an issue this morning with Trade the News."
"915760","922060"," I tried to re-up my, I think I can re-up it right now on another computer, but my"
"922060","923740"," credit card was canceled for fraud."
"924220","924840"," I don't know why. "
"925880","929580"," So I'm going to have to look into that and see why I'm getting flagged for fraud this morning."
"929940","932180"," So I'm going to turn on right off the gate this morning."
"932600","934460"," We'll see if we can take some trades here off the bell. "
"935580","937680"," We're going to follow the options flow, of course."
"938440","942460"," And if you guys want, I can post these levels for you on Twitter this morning."
"942880","945840"," So you guys can at least follow along with, what Spock Emma says. "
"946760","951200"," You guys can set, snap these lines on your own, on your own stuff."
"952580","953680"," Let's see what you guys are doing."
"954440","955060"," Spies dropping. "
"955620","956140"," Had a good week."
"956300","956580"," Can I complain?"
"956840","957280"," Yeah, it was a good week."
"959300","960860"," Right-hand cord is slightly cropped. "
"961280","966140"," Yeah, what I'll do is I will, I'll post this for you on Twitter right now so you can snap"
"966140","969060"," your own lines for today and follow along as we trade the day."
"969060","973080"," Okay, if you guys can't see the lines right now, don't worry about it too much."
"973620","977520"," I will attempt to bring this in right there. "
"977640","977920"," Does that help?"
"978440","979960"," That helps you guys out right there."
"981180","983160"," So you guys can see the lines a little bit better."
"984340","986600"," So 450 or excuse me, 400-4500. "
"987240","994340"," And we've got, I'll just set the, I'll post the link for you on Twitter, on Twitter right now, and"
"994340","995920"," down in the discord, I'll post that for you."
"996280","997140"," We've got seven minutes left."
"998300","1004260"," Let me see again, get this in a little bit larger time frame so that you can see those, those"
"1004260","1006000"," lines once more, okay?"
"1008280","1010400"," Break below, briefly break below right here, 430. "
"1011600","1013000"," We're going to end up testing this 420."
"1013740","1016380"," It actually does set up this, a larger move."
"1016980","1018520"," Get down to that 490. "
"1019040","1020340"," Oh, excuse me, 390."
"1020680","1023920"," Don't come back at me in three weeks and be like, oh, well, we didn't go down to 390."
"1024819","1027540"," You know that we have to confirm as we move in any direction. "
"1028300","1031720"," You know that we have to trade what's in front of us to the right at any point."
"1031740","1036280"," We can trade down here and swoop right back up and get super duper bullish again."
"1037660","1039020"," Good morning, Tessa Wolf. "
"1039099","1039579"," Good to see you."
"1041460","1042880"," Yeah, my brother pirates, bro."
"1043800","1044599"," Good to see you. "
"1044660","1048280"," Oh, I've got the, I've got the background, but I don't have it on this computer yet."
"1049100","1050240"," I know I'll get it up."
"1050400","1058780"," I'm going to say I can get up here so I'm going to see what's going on. "
"1059320","1062540"," I don't know if it's just because I'm spending in the wrong places or whatever."
"1063220","1066540"," Not like I'm going to strip clubs or anything, but I think I'm just, I've got a lot of activity"
"1066540","1067700"," going on right now in my card."
"1068840","1072880"," So I'm going to, when I give you one more, I'm going to give you a better snapshot of the"
"1072880","1074180"," levels for spot camera for today. "
"1074820","1076080"," This would be just on a spy chart."
"1077260","1082330"," I think I have them on, let him get some walkiness."
"1084310","1090200"," I think I have them on, this is what you're looking for right here. "
"1090800","1092160"," So you can see those lines there."
"1093960","1095800"," And you can see where, so we've got our one."
"1095900","1101860"," This is resistance one support one support two resistance to end our volatility trigger to get"
"1101860","1102860"," above the volatility trigger. "
"1103200","1106400"," We end up price targeting 460 above."
"1109900","1113200"," Now we're going to talk at just two topics we'll talk about today."
"1113340","1117800"," Okay, we're going to talk about the first topic is going to be the manipulation of it on yesterday. "
"1118360","1121000"," Then we're just going to talk about the outlook for the rest of the year."
"1121100","1125320"," If any of you guys are wondering about your positions in the market, long term holding on stocks,"
"1126000","1131100"," long term investment ideas, if we, if we get slow today for a little bit, we're going to go through"
"1131100","1138920"," the market and discuss positioning and discuss some stock picks for the rest of the year, how to"
"1138920","1144560"," manage stocks, how long you should be managing them for, do you manage them for one to three months"
"1144560","1148600"," or is it price targets on stocks and what stocks you should be buying."
"1149160","1151060"," I think you're going to have to back to managers here. "
"1151320","1154920"," I think it's going to be, I think it's going to be we're going to retest at some point."
"1155320","1157000"," I think we're going to retest at 420 or even lower."
"1158520","1163220"," You can buy another bottom down there and I think we're going to do it again at least twice this"
"1163220","1163460"," year. "
"1165060","1167280"," And eventually I'll have a nice big fat Christmas rally."
"1168620","1170240"," And you can actually probably make triple your money this year."
"1170240","1174780"," I think of a year right now as condensed into three to four parts. "
"1175580","1179640"," If we trade sideways and slightly down this year, just think of it like a one year being condensed"
"1179640","1180660"," to three months."
"1181360","1182580"," I think, I think that's the key."
"1183800","1184200"," Yeah. "
"1185660","1187160"," Thanks for subscribing our apps."
"1187560","1189340"," Yeah, the banks are going to be the banks coming for me."
"1190100","1194320"," I think it's just this one card and so I don't, I don't know, I don't know what's going on. "
"1194700","1195820"," I'm going to turn this off right now."
"1196100","1199980"," We're going to load up the, we're going to load up the book map here."
"1201980","1204180"," And let me know in the comments what you guys think. "
"1205120","1207900"," Let me know in the comments what you guys think is going to happen off the bell."
"1208280","1212580"," If I had to guess, I think that we trade lower off the bell."
"1212920","1213700"," No, I don't know. "
"1213800","1214600"," There's two sides to it."
"1215040","1216420"," Can't really predict it today."
"1217640","1218660"," It's going to be a tough one to predict. "
"1220740","1223940"," It's going to be a tough one because we could try to get higher off the bell and then short"
"1223940","1224860"," to get right back in."
"1225200","1227100"," I'm assuming short is going to cover up the bell."
"1227540","1230000"," We're going to trade higher and then they're going to attempt to take it lower. "
"1230840","1231700"," That's my assumption."
"1232720","1238360"," But I don't think that the bank or I don't think that the market makers want to pay those puts."
"1239220","1241740"," So sideways and slightly higher. "
"1243040","1246320"," If I had to choose, that's probably my guess today."
"1247820","1249320"," All the bad news is out of the way."
"1250000","1252380"," And we've got no real bad news coming out on Monday. "
"1253320","1257940"," And I don't think they want to absolutely murder it into open."
"1258760","1262840"," And one other thing, it might be a slow day today because we've got the Super Bowl on Sunday."
"1263540","1270570"," So be careful out there with the liquidity in the market today. "
"1273410","1275090"," Now, I don't think this report's going to be that bad."
"1275230","1277870"," It's going to be bad, but I'm not your buddy friend."
"1278290","1279170"," I'm not your friend, pal. "
"1279910","1280850"," I'm not your guy, guy."
"1283070","1289390"," So what we're going to do is let me know in the comments, what do you guys think we're going"
"1289390","1289890"," to do today?"
"1290670","1295330"," If you guys think we're going up or down, we're going to have a whiskey later today as well."
"1295890","1300150"," And we'll have a cocktail together for all you guys being here all week long, supporting the"
"1300150","1302810"," channel because I know you guys spend a lot of time here. "
"1302830","1304190"," You spend a lot of time inside the discord."
"1307860","1310300"," And so we're going to we're going to toast this week."
"1310360","1314800"," We're going to talk about some topics. "
"1314800","1317000"," The major manipulation in the market yesterday can't deny it."
"1318420","1319520"," This does happen."
"1319720","1323000"," There was insider trading across the board the market yesterday. "
"1325250","1327250"," It's kind of disgusting in a way, right?"
"1331000","1331660"," The parlays."
"1340990","1341930"," Let's pump it."
"1344960","1346640"," Yeah, there's no more bad news coming out. "
"1347160","1352940"," I can almost guarantee you that you're not getting doom and gloom on a Friday, heading into the"
"1352940","1354180"," weekend of Super Bowl weekend."
"1354860","1356500"," All the monies who made this week."
"1358420","1359800"," I'm highly doubting. "
"1359880","1364220"," It's like bloodbath or anything crazy."
"1364840","1366720"," I don't think that they're going to do that to you today."
"1369280","1373180"," If you've got OPEC's next week, they're going to try to get where they want it to be. "
"1373560","1375500"," I think Winky yesterday was saying that they wanted it."
"1375860","1377660"," He thinks they wanted it for 53."
"1378400","1381660"," I think he said that was for this OPEC for Friday today. "
"1382760","1387580"," And I think we were talking about what it's going to be next Friday."
"1387800","1388760"," Looks like the market is open."
"1388880","1393040"," It's 9.30. We're going to see what happens here. "
"1396620","1399320"," I'm going to expect some shorts to get cut loose here."
"1400660","1405200"," No, I don't let some of the bears want that want to print off this opening bell."
"1409680","1413600"," Some Tesla puts off the bell, February 11, 9.10 p."
"1415380","1418440"," I'm going to give you guys this chart. "
"1422090","1422970"," See if I can."
"1426460","1429360"," Oh dude, I've got my computer's trying to restart."
"1430540","1432060"," Like what is going on today?"
"1432820","1433980"," They just don't want me to win. "
"1439870","1441570"," I'll try to post this for you guys."
"1452260","1453900"," And video calls off the bell."
"1454180","1455320"," AMD calls off the bell. "
"1459570","1463530"," More AMD calls off the bell to keep your eyes on AMD and Nvidia this morning."
"1480610","1482190"," I'll do this one for you here."
"1488590","1489570"," Save this here. "
"1496290","1499910"," I'm going to post this to the ad captain's alpha Twitter handle."
"1506060","1507260"," This is the level."
"1507520","1511940"," So you guys can, if any of you guys are not familiar with the levels from Spock Emma, you can"
"1511940","1517650"," use something basic just like this in your own trading. "
"1520850","1523590"," And I'm going to have some levels up every day for you."
"1524030","1528010"," I have regular pivot points support and resistance levels."
"1528010","1533010"," And then I'm also going to start posting the Spock Emma levels for you every day as well when I"
"1533010","1534050"," have the intern do that every day. "
"1534650","1535470"," I just posted them."
"1548700","1551580"," Yeah, did you see all those X uh did you see all those X?"
"1558980","1567700"," I think there's a dip in XLE this morning."
"1571100","1577020"," I'm interested in there was a ton of calls taken out this week on on X to this but there's"
"1577020","1578960"," a bunch of puts yesterday on XLE. "
"1579600","1581840"," It calls on B."

"2550400","2552580"," The crazy part is it's not cheap. "
"2552820","2553720"," It's like 400 bucks."
"2592260","2594420"," The call holders, the algorithm."
"2594420","2594860"," What goes on?"
"2596440","2607360"," Call holders switched over to 448P on whether everywhere. "
"2610130","2611670"," They were sitting on 448P."
"2611950","2615970"," Now they're sitting on 460C, 26,000 calls for 5 cents."
"2622730","2623110"," It's kind of wild. "
"2626950","2628130"," Let's see what's going on here."
"2628290","2628350"," Why?"
"2631070","2631790"," Line in."
"2634430","2637510"," Is this, maybe I'm just having problems with trade the news today. "
"2665400","2668280"," You're listening to trade the news."
"2668620","2672820"," I know I want to be in, I don't want to be in FX."
"2677910","2678810"," What is going on?"
"2699010","2702630"," I'm having some really wonky problems today with trade the news. "

"2747400","2753210"," Yeah, there's a bunch of, this is crazy."
"2753530","2761090"," There's like, uh, there's 28 or 27,000 contracts on 460C."
"2761650","2763850"," I'm like, there's no way they're printing those today. "
"2764350","2773010"," It is shocking though because they're still worth three cents, which is surprising."
"2773090","2776210"," I would expect them to be worth a penny or nothing."
"2777150","2779190"," So the market makers are giving them some validity. "
"2779710","2781350"," I don't think we go to 460 today."
"2781350","2786830"," But I am surprised that there's some interest even on those calls."
"2792230","2799610"," It looks like 448 to maybe 443 going to the 453. "
"2800090","2802230"," That would be the range, 448, 453 today."
"2803470","2804710"," We're right in the middle of it right now."
"2808130","2810410"," Or at least where the, where the structures are. "
"2813510","2815290"," Looks like that's where all the spreads are."
"2817530","2818270"," It's right in here."

"2821770","2824550"," 452 fish, 449."
"2842810","2846330"," Try to figure out what the fuck is going on with the news."
"2846630","2847870"," Five minutes at the top there. "
"2848070","2849990"," Look at the Michigan sentiment reading."
"2850350","2850630"," It's February."
"2850950","2860430"," Culinary expected that 67 current conditions seen 72.1 expectations in vaccine 64.5. When your"

"2871470","2873170"," I think CLF is a great trade."
"2875390","2879530"," It's only, it was that 1954 and pre-market."
"2882910","2884910"," It's got huge support right here. "
"2885870","2886150"," Like huge."
"2886350","2889490"," If you guys open up a chart, it's like a month on CLF."
"2890730","2891890"," It's a great place to buy. "
"2892890","2895370"," And it's only trading back since the eighth."
"2896250","2897930"," Same price, actually higher than the eighth."
"2898050","2900770"," Now it's the, now it's the same price as it was on the ninth. "
"2902550","2904430"," And it's got a huge support right now."
"2906150","2907150"," Good place to buy."

"3011530","3013530"," XLF though has a bid as well. "
"3013850","3015830"," So they're risk off but not selling the market."
"3023820","3025740"," And we have VIX crush happening."
"3034290","3038130"," See if we can see anything on the XLU. "
"3039010","3040010"," Thank you very much."

"3057110","3059050"," That's to help support the channel out there."
"3065490","3069550"," Maybe we can take a trade and look up XLE. "
"3079220","3083120"," There are 3000 contracts on XLE expiring today."
"3084040","3087520"," 3000 contracts are 10 cents and 12 cents."
"3087520","3088780"," 70C. "
"3091180","3092420"," Now 11 cents."
"3092960","3093740"," Now 9 cents."
"3094420","3097640"," So we see XLE roll over at any point if it's still trading up. "
"3098400","3099700"," But it's on an upward track."

"3656450","3657030"," for our cars."
"3657990","3661810"," Yeah, that's one thing, but can BF Goodrich charge more for their tires?"
"3662630","3664390"," Like, can Coca-Cola, I think?"
"3665010","3666590"," Carl Eiken talked about that. "
"3666910","3672350"," Carl Eiken at one point was like, you should buy Coca-Cola because they sell billions and billions"

"3675090","3678210"," And they can easily sell Coke from, let's say, that's a dollar a can."
"3678390","3683770"," They can easily raise the price to a dollar five and beat inflation, whereas a luxury good might"

"3690970","3692970"," Maybe short these other car companies."
"3695640","3702860"," Well, yeah, that's the one, this is the one bearish part of this is the Fed really can't fight"
"3702860","3707360"," inflation and the real, there's there's price gouging, right?"
"3707580","3709800"," You've got, first you've got price gouging going on. "
"3711500","3717640"," They're going to companies that shouldn't be charging, but they are, specifically like services are"

"3733450","3738390"," trading down, but that's not the issue."
"3738470","3745550"," The real issue is this is, you know, you never fight, you never truly fight inflation over time,"
"3745570","3745830"," right?"
"3746030","3747670"," You're going to keep some of it no matter what."
"3747670","3753730"," So if, let's say if a car company can get next to my dollars for a car, they can leave"
"3753730","3756690"," that price up there, even if the shortages are real. "
"3758350","3764470"," Even if inflation comes down, they're going to try to keep prices high, rental units."
"3764810","3769090"," If that if I can get, you know, $1,000 and then tomorrow I get $1,500, I'm not going"
"3769090","3773370"," to want to reduce the price of that rental unit."
"3776550","3779470"," Same as always on Tesla, you buy the dip at 880. "
"3781710","3788950"," Looks like we were getting weaker support at 880 and now some newfound support at 850."
"3789570","3792510"," Looks like that 900 has been broken through at this point, right?"
"3794610","3797090"," We'll look lower and see where the real support is."
"3797570","3799270"," I want to guess to look at this right here, okay?"
"3799950","3801730"," Well, you guys to see this if you're a Tesla bull. "
"3802430","3808490"," So we're trading down right now to 890, but on this COBAG right here, right?"
"3808490","3810090"," We've got just little buyers here."
"3810210","3812630"," You've got some more buyers here at 880."
"3813290","3817950"," You've got a major spike though of buyers now at 850 on Tesla. "
"3818350","3823350"," That means that some smarter money thinks that we're trading lower to 850."
"3824370","3826270"," And then we're going to look even lower now, okay?"
"3826470","3827950"," We're going to see where the real buyers are."
"3828770","3829870"," Be aware of this. "
"3830250","3834150"," Doesn't mean we can't trade higher if there's good news or if the market just generally gets lifted"
"3834150","3834470"," up."
"3834470","3840850"," But I want you to see that where the real buyers are like, where the majority of I'm going to"
"3840850","3843090"," buy Tesla, where they lie."
"3844510","3845730"," Let this load up here. "
"3850360","3852540"," And right now they're down here at 800."
"3853360","3857960"," So be careful if we are going to trade into a new range on Tesla."
"3858320","3859200"," Just be aware, okay?"
"3859920","3862100"," So if you hear someone on social media screaming. "
"3862400","3864520"," We're just about 45 minutes now into the trading session."
"3864520","3871700"," We continue to see two-year yield backing away from yesterday's high of 1.53, currently a 1.53%."
"3872840","3876700"," Yeah, I don't think interest rates hurt the market either."
"3878890","3881190"," I don't think interest rates hurt the market. "
"3883130","3884670"," I agree with that, Stephen Rarrow."
"3885450","3887650"," I don't think interest rates hurt the market."
"3888050","3890010"," I think they lend volatility to the market. "
"3891430","3899210"," And I think when we don't know like when when when that was intended to drop the market, it had"
"3899210","3901570"," nothing to do with anything else."
"3901910","3904170"," I want you to look at this though, if you're a Tesla bull, okay?"
"3904490","3912010"," So when you hear a Tesla bull saying, buy Tesla now right where we are today, I can assure you"
"3912010","3914350"," that the real buyers are now even lower."
"3914550","3921090"," They're down at 800, like these buyers, these big bank buyers are waiting down here at 800. "
"3921550","3924430"," And this has been a change since last week."
"3925090","3925970"," Just be conscious of that."
"3928770","3930050"," Okay, that's the game. "
"3930830","3931390"," I love you."
"3932050","3934990"," Just know that the real buyers are not here at 880."
"3935270","3936390"," They are much lower now. "
"3936550","3937850"," They were at 880."
"3938210","3943750"," This was the big wall of buyers was at 880 and they've now moved down to 800."
"3948540","3953300"," Interest rates, by the way, raising costs of debt plus need to raise taxes, eventually make the way"
"3953300","3955760"," to market a speed of change. "
"3955760","3962660"," Yeah, the question is more complex than we have to expand upon that too."
"3963500","3964780"," We have to talk about debt cycles."
"3965000","3967060"," We have to talk about QT. "
"3967740","3972060"," We have to also talk about, are they still pouring money into the system one way or another?"
"3972740","3976520"," There's always like the sneaky money that's coming into the market."
"3977320","3978120"," Not in the market."
"3978120","3979080"," We'll in domains for USA. "
"3979980","3982760"," And are they draining the liquidity out of the system too, right?"
"3982940","3985020"," Are they giving out loans to people?"
"3985020","3989440"," It doesn't matter if the rates are higher, but are they tightening the loans?"
"3990340","3993560"," Are they saying, well, you know, you know, Joe Bob."
"3994900","3996200"," By the way, it just heads up."
"3996320","3998020"," We've got some puts coming in currently. "
"3999900","4002680"," MU, March 18th, 500,000 P."
"4004320","4007820"," We've got PayPal, February 11th, 118 P."
"4009300","4015440"," RSX February, February 25th, 22 P for $19,000."
"4015660","4021600"," QQQ's February 11th, 356 P, $405,000, $105,000."
"4022700","4026920"," LCID, Lucid, February 11th, $28 P, $40,000. "
"4027460","4030900"," Spy puts February 11th, 447 P."
"4031840","4036280"," Be conscious of this Tesla chart here because this isn't looking good for Tesla."
"4037180","4038700"," Not a good looking chart."
"4040320","4050260"," ARK puts March 25th, 72.5 P, CCL puts February"
"4050260","4055300"," 11th, 23 P, UAL calls. "
"4055900","4058420"," I see UAL puts and calls, I think, out there."
"4060560","4066160"," If you're a bull, you don't want to see an extra put flow today."
"4068720","4076620"," ARK puts March 25th, 72.5 P, $460,000. "
"4077280","4082700"," Spy calls February 11th, 452, C for $38,000, UAL, more calls coming in."
"4082700","4087100"," February 11th, 48 C, $60,000 in the high tub."
"4088020","4090660"," March 18th, 5 C, $26,000. "
"4093400","4095560"," ALGOs are now on 450 P."
"4096100","4099420"," There's 50,000 contracts on 450 P."
"4101260","4102920"," I'm going to keep my eyes on those."
"4104460","4109460"," They're now basically $2.50. They're going up now."
"4110740","4114140"," I put the suck. "
"4115420","4116160"," No offense."
"4123939","4125460"," Let's see if we're drilling down here."
"4127040","4132500"," We've got sellers swooping in from above at the 450 mark and at the 449-20 mark. "
"4132740","4134460"," So we know we've got hidden sellers above at 450."
"4135380","4140060"," We already know that that's a resistance area from the talk that we had earlier."
"4140740","4142380"," The 4500 is an area of resistance. "
"4151939","4153020"," Take a look at that up here."
"4153779","4158850"," You can see these bands."
"4159090","4159750"," These are hidden sellers. "
"4160109","4160870"," They're just hiding above."
"4161149","4162490"," Waiting to take some shorts here."
"4163390","4164350"," Same above here. "
"4167620","4168939"," Situations like the Canadian border."
"4169399","4170720"," Baster bridge protesters."
"4171260","4174479"," For they've agreed to open one lane of traffic between the US and Canada. "
"4176439","4185350"," Oh, the real sellers are."
"4187270","4189410"," Real sellers are at 454."
"4189609","4195170"," We're getting scheduled for later today on 453 demonstrators. "
"4197290","4200410"," Real sellers are above 453."
"4201930","4203270"," That makes sense, right?"
"4204670","4207930"," For the spot cam report where the sellers are on this market."
"4208970","4211810"," First resistance is kind of light. "
"4212070","4213270"," So we're going to sell the top."
"4213510","4222320"," So we're only selling 450s and buying down below at let's see."
"4231730","4234970"," I'm going to buy down below a seller here. "
"4234970","4236270"," Where are we selling here, right?"
"4236630","4240050"," And buying, see where the real buying is."
"4240790","4241990"," Kind of sloppy down below here."
"4242750","4250490"," Spy puts every 11449P, $118,000 all traffic here. "
"4255760","4256440"," $445."
"4259940","4262460"," So S1 looks like it does have some decent support."
"4263220","4264140"," You can see it right here. "
"4266040","4266800"," 4445 flat."
"4290170","4292110"," Yeah, it looks like we've got the sellers just sitting above."
"4292470","4294230"," We've got to see this band of sellers here. "
"4294930","4297330"," It was like they just swoop in from 453, right?"
"4297490","4298990"," They just feed the selling at 450."
"4299770","4301970"," Every time we trade up to 450, they're selling the 450."
"4302870","4306070"," So if you're going to take a short, you'd take it anywhere between 450 and 450. "
"4306450","4310210"," And you'll hold it down to 445."
"4311970","4314230"," There is some buyers down below at 445."
"4315130","4319740"," We should be trading sideways for the rest of the day. "
"4322640","4325460"," And you can trade the tops and bottoms."
"4326520","4328240"," It's not a lot of spread there, is there?"
"4328780","4338880"," Looks like we traded it as high as 45.1.60. And we just traded down to 448.24. I"
"4338880","4340060"," think we can trade lower."
"4341040","4341960"," We can trade deeper. "
"4343420","4348260"," Catch itself a low of the day, a high of the day, and go long and short on each rip"
"4348260","4348900"," and sell."
"4358070","4359010"," Says Facebook's dumping."
"4362060","4363640"," Then we'll have some talking here. "
"4364140","4369030"," We're going to talk about, oh, yeah, Facebook dump."
"4371130","4372510"," Well, let's look at today."
"4372690","4374190"," What do you guys see happening right now?"
"4375250","4378130"," Can you guys tell me what you're seeing in the market right now?"
"4381370","4382950"," XLV is catching a bit again. "
"4386590","4389310"," Looks like the same story as before, right?"
"4391350","4395790"," So they priced in 25 basis points, three rate hikes."
"4398970","4403270"," So now they're saying priced in 50 basis points."
"4403270","4409910"," And what happened when we sold off before while we were pricing in the 25 basis points?"
"4410630","4414110"," We watched all speculative growth sell up, right?"
"4414530","4415510"," You guys remember that happening?"
"4416210","4418590"," We watched deeper selling in our K products. "
"4418990","4423790"," We watched deeper selling in anything that was speculative growth."
"4425530","4428350"," You can see it somewhat in Tesla today."
"4430010","4434910"," So you're probably expecting hits in those companies. "
"4436130","4438330"," And you're going to be expecting companies to catch a bid."
"4438690","4448560"," Like, you know, utilities, you're going to be, you'll see"
"4448560","4455160"," like utilities, hospitals, you'll see companies, maybe like Home Depot do well, construction."
"4455560","4461740"," Some construction stuff like tires, like Winky was saying, anything that people have to buy,"
"4461880","4468980"," consumer defensive, consumer staples, hospitals, utilities should be green on the day. "
"4470640","4477020"," UK defense minister, while I'm saying the constructive and frank talks with the Russian defense"
"4477020","4477580"," minister."
"4479040","4480200"," And we'll look right now."
"4480720","4487220"," So like restaurants are up today, especially goods are up today, travels up today, home improvement"
"4487220","4487840"," is up today. "
"4488340","4489460"," Energy is up today."
"4489660","4490780"," Utilities are up today."
"4491940","4495180"," Aerospace and defense for the war, right, is up today. "
"4495640","4496680"," Health care is up today."
"4497440","4498540"," Health care is up today."
"4499220","4501000"," Believe it or not, financials are up today. "
"4501440","4508260"," But anything today that's like tech, speculative growth, tech, software, the surprise software is"
"4508260","4508460"," down."
"4508920","4512980"," They should be up because they don't rely upon much speculation."
"4513780","4519700"," But today, conductors are down, internet content and information, communication services like"
"4519700","4521700"," Facebook, Google, flat or down. "
"4522900","4524780"," Surprisingly, Amazon is down today."
"4525880","4531000"," I'm actually surprised they're down today, but the portions of the market that are green are"
"4531000","4532800"," looking like defensive type stocks."
"4534720","4535600"," Merna's up today. "
"4535880","4547860"," M-R-N-A is up about 2.5%. So"
"4547860","4557600"," just be consider that also we've got T puts, 9, 16, 25, P, 2 times by 2.3 million dollars"
"4557600","4558160"," golden tickets."
"4559040","4563940"," XLF calls right now, February 18, 41, C, and financials should be up."
"4564200","4568640"," So if you see financials up in consumer defensive up, it means they're not selling the market. "
"4568780","4571100"," It means there's rotation going on right now in the market."
"4571800","4573920"," So they're rotating into defensive plays."
"4574960","4576480"," They're not selling the market. "
"4585970","4587870"," No, I try to keep track of."
"4588430","4592690"," So when I see large put blocks come in, there's a couple of things that I try to do."
"4592970","4600990"," So I try to look towards, I try to use them as a gauge for the protection that's being put"
"4600990","4605110"," on by banks, not retail. "
"4605730","4612890"," So there's a lot of defensive positioning right now in small caps by banks."
"4613650","4615770"," That's not, no matter what anybody else tells you, right?"
"4615770","4622570"," Now they took those puts when we were up at, they took those puts when we were at highs, right?"
"4622750","4627160"," We were at highs of almost 460."
"4628040","4634500"," So at 460 of Spy, they took puts against IWM, the protective puts. "
"4634780","4637520"," And we're now trading down lower, right, on the day."
"4638340","4639340"," So they're in the green."
"4640620","4641740"," They want that protection. "
"4642120","4646560"," Then all of a sudden after those three days of those puts coming out, you've got Bullard out there"
"4646560","4652820"," talking shit about companies that make up the IWM, right?"
"4653020","4657480"," So we hear things in the news like, it's all retail doing this."
"4658300","4666280"," And the reality is that these, this protection is been put on every level we've traded up."
"4667020","4669460"," We went from 420 to 430 and puts for bought. "
"4669800","4671720"," We went from 430 to 440 puts for bought."
"4671720","4675180"," We went from 440 to 450 and puts for bought."
"4675300","4677000"," And we traded down on every one of those levels. "
"4677560","4679880"," So we got to 460 or close to it, right?"
"4680020","4680520"," We traded down."
"4680680","4681180"," We sold off."
"4685650","4689170"," So they are protecting their investments and their trades at every level. "
"4691980","4696760"," And I don't understand the whole point that they were saying shit like, oh, like retail bought puts"
"4696760","4697380"," at 420."
"4697720","4701160"," I don't think- That's the answer saying that you heard clearly from the Russia government that they"
"4701160","4703540"," have no intention to invade Ukraine."
"4706400","4714520"," I've never seen puts- I didn't see any retail buyers buying puts at 420. "
"4715040","4718180"," I saw retail buyers, or at least the one I'm trading with you guys."
"4718380","4720780"," We were we shorted this market from the top."
"4721440","4722540"," Let's be clear. "
"4723380","4724500"," We shorted from 480."
"4725520","4732020"," So I don't know how anyone would think that like as a retail person was buying puts down at 420."
"4732740","4735400"," And then even on the way back up, we've been buying them on every rep. "
"4736140","4737740"," And they've printed every single time."
"4739020","4740700"," I didn't buy them this time at 460."
"4742320","4748420"," I didn't add, but I did have or I do have some at 440 and 442 for the 18th that"
"4748420","4749760"," I bought when we were at 441. "
"4750560","4756480"," And I had another set at like 420s for- I don't remember the date they were on, but I"
"4756480","4758420"," had like 420s, but I bought them on the highs."
"4759760","4763540"," I bought them at like 451 and then we traded down and those started to print."
"4764640","4766920"," I didn't want to wait until March for those to print. "
"4768820","4772500"," Which is, I don't know, it's all kind of fucking odd, like I don't understand out there."
"4774520","4779180"," What you hear in the news and what is truly happening, it's not retail buying them."
"4780040","4785320"," I know for a fucking fact that there ain't no retailer out there that bought, I don't know, I think"
"4785320","4789880"," it was like $30 million in IWM puts that too when we were at 460. "
"4791180","4793820"," That's a fucking bank of some kind out there doing that shit."
"4795840","4799460"," So every time I get to a new level, put some protection on, right?"
"4800040","4802300"," We should have done that yesterday and we didn't."
"4802380","4804740"," And I forgot, that's my fault, ultimately, that I didn't grab more protection. "
"4805260","4809680"," I was looking, I was more geared towards getting these four, I'm so focused on not losing these"
"4809680","4814020"," 440s and 442s that I'm just focused on those printing right now."
"4814300","4815860"," And I should have bought more at 460."
"4817260","4818140"," And I didn't. "
"4823740","4828080"," Sounds like CLF is cutting tons of costs, super bullish in my view, but you listen to the call"
"4828080","4837560"," yourself and decide, yeah, I'll put them on my list, they're on my list."
"4844670","4846370"," It's a safe bet to buy CLF."
"4850670","4852470"," That was a good buy this morning off the bell. "
"4853110","4855950"," 1934 already trading as high as 2072."
"4863130","4864650"," Spy trading back up to that 450."
"4867840","4871500"," Looking pretty freaking range bound right just like yesterday. "

"4891870","4901010"," Tesla puts every 11th, 890p and video puts."
"4904450","4909210"," Yeah, we need to get this, we got to knock this Vix down here. "
"4926800","4928460"," I don't know, CLF didn't it?"
"4928460","4932520"," I thought we were looking at the chart on CLF and it looks very supportive."
"4933680","4942390"," I thought we were looking at, I mean, on the sixth month there's a turn here."
"4943570","4945350"," Looks like it was bought at 1581. "
"4945730","4950670"," That looks like some pretty high volume down there at 1581."
"4962510","4964970"," It's long-term chart, it looks pretty damn good here."
"4966050","4975910"," If I'm looking at CLF going back to December of 2021, it just bounced down here at"
"4975910","4976490"," 1581. "
"4977330","4981090"," It was bought, it's got a pretty decent projection here."
"4981910","4990900"," It's not like going to the moon or anything, just from a perspective of accumulation and"
"4990900","4991220"," distribution."
"4994420","4998600"," I guess I can see your point, you can say that you'll be selling the high soon on it. "
"5003810","5008350"," I guess I see your point, you're saying that it's not out of its distribution phase yet."
"5009590","5015530"," I want to be selling it at like 21 bucks and then rebuy again down here at 16 bucks, possible."
"5016190","5021270"," I get that point, I see that, I see that argument on CLF. "
"5026820","5032180"," For the President Biden met with his national security advisors in the situation room at the White"
"5032180","5037360"," House Thursday night to discuss Russia's ongoing military build-up around Ukraine and increased"
"5037360","5037860"," tensions."
"5039160","5042680"," I also want to be clear on IWM, right?"
"5042960","5052560"," Those IWM hedges are not going to print unless they get further put structure, right?"
"5053400","5056640"," They're never going to print those unless we get more bad news."
"5057860","5060260"," But just because you see those hedges doesn't mean they're getting printed. "
"5060260","5071570"," It calls"
"5071570","5081490"," on BA February 11th 220 C AMD February 11th 125 C for 33,000 and 6 to 9,000 dollars,"

"5090990","5095970"," and the bulls think that IWM is going to be trading up to call it 214."
"5097610","5098530"," I don't know though."
"5104570","5136790"," The price target on IWM is 214.55. There's"
"5136790","5139230"," a pretty big, there's a pretty big rotation going on. "
"5141430","5142070"," Here's the point."
"5144490","5149970"," The rotation is out of speculative growth and definitely into defensive."
"5179610","5185410"," The UK defense minister is saying UK troops sent to Ukraine for two purposes will return soon. "
"5187810","5191930"," Only the Russian defense minister raised questions about those UK troops in Ukraine."
"5194370","5194930"," Exactly."
"5195190","5195750"," It is a cool place. "
"5199910","5203310"," Yes, I'm banking committee to old vote on federal reserve."

"5246910","5252230"," A run just said RSX puts today is a no is a no confidence vote."
"5252390","5253710"," The Russia won't be invading news."
"5254490","5255590"," That's a fair point. "
"5256030","5257770"," There's a ton of those puts out there right now."
"5267430","5271750"," I've been spying and selling calls on on spy right now."
"5273330","5277950"," So you if you're you guys I want to tell you guys something really clear about some of you guys"
"5277950","5278970"," are buying zero dates. "
"5281190","5284630"," Do you see this band here 447 or so?"
"5286130","5286930"," Then 451."
"5288150","5291610"," See how it's zigging up and down you can only buy each push right now."
"5293390","5297530"," Do not be holding any zero dates today for the whole entire day. "
"5298130","5301350"," The market makers and dealers are burning the value in them."
"5302950","5309330"," So if you're in some right now on the next rip here in puts or calls rip if it rips"
"5309330","5314770"," or sells take your money and run and wait until the next dip by or top the sell."
"5315890","5320770"," You should be in puts right now on the spy not in calls. "
"5321850","5323450"," You should be looking to sell puts."
"5325470","5334010"," Probably at 448.3. I'm going to be looking to enter calls."
"5343530","5345310"," Be looking for some sort of buy. "
"5345530","5349470"," See the buyers down here 44811."
"5350930","5352590"," See these sellers coming up here."
"5352910","5356830"," If you are making money right down your calls right get the fuck out of them. "
"5358590","5360410"," I'm going to buy the dips and then sell the rips."
"5376670","5378030"," I'm watching it right now."
"5378030","5380370"," I'm looking at CLF on the year chart. "
"5382450","5383810"," I like it on the year chart."
"5386610","5388490"," I'm just looking at it on a year chart right now."
"5389710","5391170"," Year chart is positive. "
"5395640","5398120"," But you can see the accumulation distribution down."
"5399140","5400840"," They probably say sell it soon."
"5401420","5401900"," It makes sense. "
"5402300","5406620"," They sold it off of $2,177 right?"
"5406920","5412900"," So maybe just set an alert for like $16 in 50 cents."
"5414360","5417160"," Next time it comes down there grab them again and trade them up."
"5419060","5421860"," And in all honesty it's in a giant fucking bull flag. "
"5424060","5425880"," Pretty big fucking bull flag here."
"5426360","5427000"," I'm not going to lie."
"5436420","5438320"," Be real careful out there with zero dates. "
"5438420","5439940"," You should be buying and selling them as we go."
"5441360","5442740"," Buying the dips, selling the rips."
"5450340","5456820"," Yeah, sailing is at 452 and we're breaking through the, we're breaking through right now a little"
"5456820","5458460"," bit of the sellers hiding here at 450. "
"5461460","5462920"," We still have the sailing above."
"5463640","5464220"," Jason is correct."
"5465240","5466600"," The sellers are still hiding up there. "
"5467220","5470200"," They look like they're not there but they're there."
"5471600","5473360"," They're being very sneaky right now."
"5480760","5482940"," Yeah, selling calls and puts is great right now. "
"5483180","5486800"," I would think that a fly right now is printing nicely."
"5488540","5489900"," A fly at the close."
"5490120","5493520"," Yeah, or I guess not the close yesterday but the open today would have a nice outstanding as well. "
"5497010","5499850"," I'm selling, I'm buying and selling calls."
"5502550","5506650"," I'm not in anything at the moment but I've bought two rips and sold."
"5506650","5508430"," I've bought and sold two rips now. "
"5512190","5513730"," Joe Donut, are you in the live stream?"
"5518600","5523460"," Yeah, Jason just made a comment is what, so he's looking for, which I agree with."
"5523660","5526040"," You wait for a move higher and then you grab a short."
"5526340","5528700"," You may wait for a nice fat dip and then you grab a long. "
"5533740","5535400"," Right now we're right on view up."
"5536280","5537380"," Didlin in the Midland."
"5537380","5537620"," Didlin in the Midland. "
"5562150","5566490"," Tesla calls, February 11th, 920C for $60,000."
"5567210","5571910"," United Airlines calls, UAL calls have been coming in all day long since the open, UAL."
"5572830","5573290"," Look at UAL. "
"5576230","5578530"," Probably going to take a short here in just a little bit."
"5590760","5593360"," MU calls, March 18th, 105C."
"5594260","5596020"," We can get back up to 452, I will. "
"5616630","5618330"," Yeah, I saw tech calls coming yesterday."
"5629660","5631720"," Are we coming into resolution of the triangle?"
"5633860","5635520"," I'll look up Roblox next for you."
"5636720","5638900"," Are we coming in some resolution on the triangle?"
"5641640","5649660"," No, we're kind of in a place right now where I think we're going to reject up here and we're"
"5649660","5650260"," going to trade lower. "
"5652860","5654580"," I think we get some rejection coming up."
"5655940","5664230"," I think it's the rejection coming up and then I think we trade down."
"5665630","5668070"," We're going to be trading inside of this zone for some time. "
"5670690","5672230"," We're in negative gamma."
"5672590","5674150"," We're below the volatility trigger."
"5676290","5685650"," Even if we trade up to 453, I think we're going to trade sideways and down into Opex and then"
"5685650","5687070"," you'll have one strong day. "
"5687890","5688890"," That's what I think."
"5689090","5694650"," I think we trade sideways from here, right?"
"5695090","5699790"," From 453, we trade down from now into let's say next Wednesday."
"5701370","5708530"," We have one nice strong fat day like Wednesday, Thursday, probably Thursday and then we'll sell it"
"5708530","5711210"," down into Opex. "
"5715620","5717220"," Hopefully it can get 442."
"5719180","5721240"," On this on the sideways down trade."
"5735970","5737610"," AMC screen today. "
"5744950","5746170"," SQ's green today."
"5751140","5752760"," PayPal is green today."
"5759190","5760810"," Peton looks like it's about to fall off a cliff. "
"5770680","5772820"," RK is up 3%."
"5784410","5788830"," Uber, May 20th, 40C, $1.5 million."
"5789970","5794870"," Zillow, February 11th, 56C, $29,000. "
"5797150","5802650"," Nvidia, February 18th, 260C, $254,000."
"5807880","5809780"," Now it aligns just cranking."
"5812180","5882250"," Looking at some resistance above here at $49.94. Price targets above of $50.96 and $51.91. More"
"5882250","5883450"," sellers still on PayPal. "
"5902370","5909910"," Fellows at $123.72. This looks like support here, $116, $110, and $100."
"5911850","5914270"," It looks more like more like more selling."
"5918150","5920090"," Real buyers are at $100 on PayPal. "
"5923370","5924510"," See what looks like above."
"5928130","5929410"," Now you can move up on PayPal."
"5930610","5932670"," I think the real sellers are above at $150. "
"5934350","5934750"," Not of that trade."
"5936570","5943950"," You can get past $124.29. Looks like that's the price target for today."
"5944490","6000280"," $124, $123.63. The"
"6053180","6056740"," market needs the flush to $4,300 to knock some cents into these bulltards. "
"6058300","6062250"," Too funny."
"6066450","6068430"," See if we can look and see what's going on with."
"6068770","6069550"," Here are indicators negative. "
"6069830","6070950"," More sellers again on Square."
"6072770","6074570"," PayPal chart looks better than the SQ chart."
"6081320","6082740"," Very light support here. "
"6084960","6086460"," Real buyers are down at $100."
"6094430","6096890"," It looks like SQ is heavily shorted."
"6098150","6098670"," That's the guess. "
"6108990","6110210"," Like the PayPal chart better."
"6124000","6124600"," And then Roblox next."
"6135170","6136130"," Hey, Damien, how are you, brother?"
"6139550","6141210"," How you been doing, dude, Damien?"
"6151290","6153250"," Yep, Somali stock market. "
"6153770","6155070"," Yeah, look at SoFi next."
"6159030","6161830"," You guys, uh, Mars bars."
"6162470","6163590"," You like the compression of the mic?"
"6165650","6167630"," Yes, I do have compression on the mic. "
"6167770","6169110"," You can tell I've got compression."
"6169990","6172070"," I've got all three of those going on."
"6172170","6178370"," I've got the compression, the expander, and the compressor, the expander, and whatever the other"
"6178370","6178810"," thing is. "
"6180990","6184610"," Mars bars knows exactly what the Mars bars somehow knows something about."
"6184610","6188890"," Oh, audio, engineering, you must."
"6189970","6192730"," We've got compression and I've got a bunch of stuff. "
"6192830","6197330"," So Canada, the premier of Ontario, has declared a state of emergency, threatening severe"
"6197330","6199650"," consequences for the protest."
"6201090","6207790"," The province of Ontario premier commenting here on the border blockage by the truckers."
"6209610","6212350"," Dude, Canadian spent the last four years. "
"6213830","6215850"," You know, acting like they're all better than the US."
"6216530","6221730"," You know, but right now they're looking just as dumb as us."
"6224070","6231730"," Canadians are always bragging of how, uh, how nice they are and how great everything is up there in"
"6231730","6232030"," Canada. "
"6233950","6235250"," They look just like the US."
"6236110","6238890"," Damien, how are you doing, brother?"
"6240250","6245210"," Oh, yeah, Damien's saying Jimmy, Jim, Jim, once again, 440 by the clothes."
"6249510","6251450"," Okay, we're going to look at sofi for you. "
"6254640","6255520"," I have an FM voice."
"6256520","6266310"," So I used"
"6266310","6275450"," to my, my professional, my profession for a long, long time, put me in contact with famous people."
"6278040","6283260"," And, uh, Hollywood types and that kind of stuff, producers and directors. "
"6283860","6293580"," And back in the day, I was constantly asked if I wanted to read audio books or"
"6293580","6300200"," try out, I guess, or something for, uh, speaking roles and stuff like that."
"6301500","6302660"," I thought I should take it up as a profession."
"6303060","6303760"," And I always said, no. "
"6312670","6314050"," Okay, so Roblox."
"6316630","6320090"," 54 dollars, wall of sellers up here."
"6320750","6324550"," You'd need a news event to squeeze these sellers right now. "
"6325250","6328070"," You can see that there is a nice thick wall of sellers here."
"6328290","6330030"," See how big this wall of sellers is."
"6331090","6335570"," The other thing that you could do would be to wear out the sellers and then trade it higher. "
"6339810","6346130"," If you are in Roblox, it does look right now like it's, you know, take your profit and wait for,"
"6346130","6355470"," move higher than 75.07. Otherwise you'd be buying the dip down below at 55.49. I'm a fan of"
"6355470","6355850"," Roblox."
"6356050","6362950"," If you're, if your outlook is one, two, three years, sure, I'll just buy it anywhere."
"6370040","6373200"," If you get a problem with Canada Goose's, you get a problem with me. "
"6373500","6374080"," You know, it's funny."
"6375620","6379120"," My, you guys are going to hate me for this."
"6379120","6381440"," So I don't hate Canadians. "
"6381760","6383400"," I've got a Canadian in the family, believe it or not."
"6384140","6387260"," I have a, we have an actual Canadian in the family."
"6389520","6396180"," But I make this Joe, so my youngest daughter, we would see Canadian geese. "
"6398580","6402830"," And she, you know, she asked me, what are those?"
"6402990","6406570"," And I said, I told my youngest daughter, I said, those are illegal immigrants."
"6408130","6409230"," They don't belong here."
"6409510","6410550"," They belong back in Canada. "
"6413280","6416320"," And so I told her that for years and years and years and years, right?"
"6417020","6419320"," She doesn't know what an illegal immigrant is."
"6419800","6421360"," She's like four, five, six years old."
"6424500","6428180"," And one day we were at the park. "
"6430500","6434520"," And my daughter said to me, look daddy, it's illegal immigrants."
"6436040","6444200"," And she was like looking at some geese and a lady and her daughter were so offended that I had"
"6444200","6451560"," taught my daughter that horrible, horrible joke that Canadian geese don't belong in the US."
"6451940","6453900"," Now I, I'm fine with illegal immigrants. "
"6454660","6457980"," I want more, more immigration in this country to be clear."
"6458480","6460860"," So I'm not that person at all."
"6461760","6465180"," But, you know, of course it was just a pun play with my, my kid. "
"6466560","6467880"," Probably shouldn't have done that."
"6468140","6470560"," Wasn't, wasn't one of, wasn't one of my best moments."
"6471800","6472600"," To do that. "
"6474460","6476000"," Of course I got the evil eye."
"6478200","6479480"," Ooh, I like so far here."
"6480200","6480740"," I like it a lot. "
"6481540","6482160"," Beautiful chart."
"6483380","6484640"," More buyers than sellers."
"6485660","6486900"," Gorgeous support down here. "
"6487620","6489460"," 13, 18, I found a 10 bucks."
"6491160","6492040"," I'm from the West."
"6492420","6497260"," So, you know, I'm used to, um, I have lots of Mexican friends. "
"6501430","6503130"," I've been here much longer than we have."
"6504130","6507190"," But this is more of just the slight towards her uncle."
"6509650","6512030"," And, uh, my brother-in-law. "
"6514750","6515350"," Reagan balls."
"6517490","6519030"," There's a large rotation."
"6519330","6520350"," There was two things going on. "
"6522210","6527610"," Yeah, it's about geese."
"6530250","6533090"," But of course, some of the parents, you know, that parents are right now, right?"
"6533330","6536850"," Parents are, you know, there's always a, there's always a fucking problem."
"6537950","6539810"," And I'm, of course, the dad with the daughter. "
"6539990","6540690"," My wife's not there."
"6540790","6541290"," It's just me."
"6542990","6546310"," So, of course, you know, I'm teaching my kid bad things. "
"6550650","6552870"," So, IWM is up because there's rotation."
"6553550","6555530"," Number one, there's earnings."

"6597990","6603430"," There's a rotation right now into a consumer, uh, defensive and cyclicals."
"6603430","6606530"," And then they, they have to play, replace risky bets. "
"6606930","6608810"," So, they do this on beating up stocks."
"6609810","6612770"," I will find an article about it and show it to you guys."
"6612930","6613750"," I'll post it on Twitter. "

"6984960","6988300"," We've had Vix blast off into the bell."

"6994240","6994820"," down on Monday."
"6996120","6998040"," We've had some bad Mondays though too, right?"
"6998680","6999920"," When we've blasted off on Fridays. "
"7007550","7009610"," See, we can keep trading higher here to 4 52."

"7076390","7077950"," These guys are fucking dickheads."
"7081360","7085300"," Fucking the algorithm is trying to park this shit right into a 450 for the bell."
"7092530","7094750"," Fucking, oh god, these algorithms sometimes. "
"7096110","7097370"," They suck so bad."
"7099750","7101190"," All right, I'm out again."
"7103170","7109950"," So as we were trading up just then an algorithm came in just slammed with like 80,000 contracts for"
"7109950","7116310"," like two minutes and just stopped the stop the stop the move higher and then pulled the bid, not"
"7116310","7118870"," the bid, but the actual contracts bottom sold them. "

"7302170","7304750"," That shit wasn't staying down overnight like that."
"7304790","7306170"," There was no fucking way. "
"7308230","7312630"," I was hoping that it would hold I was like I think at one point I posted I was like"
"7312630","7317410"," if that's really if we hold with if we hold a or point eight percent down or one percent down"
"7317410","7322010"," in the overnight that shit's going to sling shot to the to the moon on the open."
"7323030","7324190"," There was no way."
"7326070","7329630"," Yeah, that was a whole scam yesterday. "
"7330710","7338150"," That was a that all the all the trading yesterday was was built around market manipulation."
"7341570","7347290"," All right, so someone just rebot those 54.52s. They're down to 54 cents."
"7348130","7350890"," So now we've got 80,000 contracts on them. "
"7351390","7352190"," This is disgusting."
"7353870","7356130"," This is all very disgusting here."
"7358170","7359910"," So I'm going to try to buy those again. "

"7386700","7393180"," firm had a long position a giant long position and just wanted out before the bad news was dropped. "
"7393860","7395440"," Somebody scammed that whole thing."
"7396260","7399260"," The whole uber thing was a scam uber and left."
"7399960","7401280"," That was all a scam. "
"7401280","7404960"," And you don't see any true news come out about it today."
"7405180","7410440"," Like you want the SEC to get involved in something yesterday was a huge huge."
"7412080","7413940"," I'm not buying this dip yet by the way. "
"7414300","7416160"," I don't think this dip is done."
"7419150","7421030"," There was scams all over the internet yesterday."
"7421810","7424270"," If we can get 445 that would be taller. "
"7432850","7440060"," Yeah, there's the whole thing is a scam."
"7440380","7442980"," Like the yesterday was a complete not her fucking scam."

"7446980","7450080"," And I'm like, fucking fuck the stock pumpers on Twitter."
"7450260","7452520"," Find out who the fuck pulled that shade yesterday."
"7454200","7455540"," And then you see Bullard. "
"7455940","7458420"," Bullard did that yesterday for money."
"7458580","7463820"," You got if you guys think Bullard did that yesterday to to knock the market down because of like"
"7463820","7467200"," some kind of some kind of like altruistic reason."
"7467840","7471640"," That fucking guy was used to be always bearish. "
"7471640","7475980"," And then he got super bullish last September, I think, or October or November sometime."
"7476960","7478740"," And we were expecting him to speak."
"7478800","7485260"," And he came out and just he was like, was like, uber bull, uber bull. "
"7485680","7489260"," And the market shot up and they found out what once they golf got caught."
"7491520","7494540"," Once they all got cut, we got some puts rolling in right now heads up."
"7495060","7496980"," This is not your dip, if you didn't know. "
"7505270","7515260"," So, so my point is that, you know, even that guy, that guy pissed off a lot of bears"
"7515260","7517640"," because like that, like he's their guy."
"7518560","7521280"," And, you know, he came out super bullish."
"7521280","7526840"," And then afterwards, when they found out they were all holding shit, you see that, you see that,"
"7526980","7529160"," you know, he was holding fucking lungs in the market. "
"7529180","7531320"," So does it to me?"
"7531600","7538300"," Oh, a firm is selling off heavily, firm down to $50.76 firm."
"7539910","7543870"," But does the firm have no heads up right now?"
"7543870","7548290"," Okay, guys, you see these sellers stepping in right now, $4.49. So let's be careful here."
"7548890","7552570"," If you're a bull, okay, be super duper careful here. "

"7769950","7773410"," We'll see if we actually trade down from here or not."
"7775610","7778290"," But if this does break, you see this green here. "

"7867760","7873220"," Yeah, if we can pull up a little bit, I'll grab some more puts and puts some dip buyers stepping"
"7873220","7873500"," in."
"7873780","7875540"," I don't think these are the right dip buyers though. "
"7876160","7878140"," I don't think they know that we've got sellers in the market."
"7884060","7893690"," I'm not going to give you guys the calls right now because I don't believe I think we're going to"
"7893690","7895310"," pump it to like right here."
"7895650","7899670"," It's $4.48. 90 or so and then we're going to start selling again. "
"7900450","7901650"," So just make sure you get right positioning."
"7902810","7904850"," If you want to take this short, they might pump it up."
"7905770","7908430"," And so if they pump it up briefly, grab short again. "
"7909310","7911270"," Unless this wall disappears, we're going down."
"7911450","7912010"," I guarantee it."
"7918750","7921970"," If our CEO's on CNBC, what the fuck are they saying?"
"7923290","7926170"," I think this has more to do with the Euro close than anything. "
"7926550","7928330"," I don't think this has to do with anything that's in the news."
"7933750","7934930"," Price target below 445."
"7935610","7942910"," Those puts are currently $0.72 but you might want to wait. "
"7943390","7943930"," Just give it a minute."
"7944250","7945170"," Let them come down a little bit."
"7946910","7947590"," Timing is key. "
"7949370","7956910"," Look for a trade at $4.48. 50 as well."
"7958610","7959470"," Somewhere in here."
"7961330","7962630"," Looking to grab some puts. "
"7967290","7969090"," Timing is key, especially on puts."
"7969790","7974130"," More important than calls because they only pay one to one."
"7977030","7977890"," You got to wait. "
"7978130","7978910"," Get a time in perfectly."
"7981170","7982490"," That initial rip down."
"7983050","7985230"," If you want to be bearish, you're normally a bull. "
"7985490","7986210"," You wait for that first."
"7986670","7987050"," Dip down."
"7987850","7989910"," You wait for it to pull back up again, right?"
"7990770","7992110"," You're going to wait for it. "
"7992190","7993250"," It's like this sentiment."
"7995210","7998790"," You're going to see the original short payoff right here."
"7999550","8000450"," Cover their shorts. "
"8001850","8004750"," And then somewhere right up in here, we're going to look for rejection."
"8012690","8014510"," And bulls are like, yeah, we're going up."
"8015710","8019150"," In reality, there's a bunch of sellers up there just waiting. "
"8019410","8021110"," This is the one that pays off usually too."
"8021930","8025310"," This one, this leg down usually is the one that pays off handsomely."
"8028570","8037030"," Yeah, there's sellers hiding right here. "
"8038950","8052210"," $4.48.92. And"
"8058190","8065350"," they're now down to $0.60. Might grab some right here."
"8070180","8071880"," Come up just a little bit more."
"8075430","8076690"," A little bit more. "
"8087810","8089130"," No, I'm not buying for that much."
"8089450","8094910"," I want them at like $0.54. $0.54, asshole."
"8096810","8107590"," I want"
"8117990","8118470"," them cheaper. "
"8127250","8135410"," NWM puts, Tesla puts, PFE puts, spy puts, RKLB, rocket lab puts."
"8136310","8143630"," Looks like that rocket lab put is against what's the Astra, right?"
"8144570","8151170"," Simply puts, AMC, more calls, BAC, AMC's in pumping all day long, right?"
"8152390","8153410"," Pump room shit."
"8165550","8167630"," All you bulls think you're going to win here, don't you?"
"8175150","8179270"," I'm on 445P. "
"8182630","8185010"," I've got an order in for 54 cents."
"8185010","8188370"," 445P."
"8210760","8215240"," Come"
"8270629","8291370"," on"
"8314320","8314320"," down. "
"8316530","8318650"," Yeah, I'm not getting a fill on these puts."
"8322270","8323910"," It hasn't come down low enough for me."
"8333100","8334860"," I got rules when I buy these things. "
"8335480","8339059"," I want them cheap."
"8339360","8342120"," I can't get them cheap, but I'm not getting in on them."
"8356680","8365200"," Calls on Uber, 520, May 20th, 37.5, 37.5C, $360,000. "
"8365459","8367740"," CLF though, that's a high-auto score on those calls."
"8368760","8374500"," Those are February 25th, 21.5C. More a firm puts."
"8376299","8377820"," The firm just getting hammered. "
"8380219","8381000"," Come on, spy."
"8381240","8381840"," Come on down, baby."
"8384900","8386820"," Sell it down to 445 for daddy. "
"8387980","8389940"," The firms just go into the depths of hell."
"8393920","8399500"," Just a note on a firm that the bottom was 48, 35."
"8401220","8403640"," It'll be interesting to see if it breaks through support. "
"8403880","8407740"," We'll bring up a firm right now and see if there's real support or not."
"8414460","8419060"," AFRM, because that could be a pretty serious or a significant drop for a firm."
"8421320","8425040"," They're trying to pound a firm right now. "
"8430160","8431200"," What's going on, bulls?"
"8431400","8433400"," I thought you were going to break through 449."
"8435280","8436400"," We're having that breakthrough."
"8442740","8448560"," Because I was watching the options chain all morning. "
"8449520","8454720"," Let's say it's Friday and you have a zero-date option that's expiring on Friday and today's Friday,"
"8454880","8460300"," it's 9.30. The option you're interested in, let's say it's worth a dollar."
"8463110","8471710"," The market makers typically want that option to be worth one penny or zero pennies by the close."
"8474010","8478030"," You'll see them pump and dump throughout the course of a day. "
"8479570","8482010"," At the same time, eventually lose value."
"8483690","8485730"," Let's say they started a dollar, any option."
"8486070","8488490"," Let's say they started a dollar and then they pumped to a dollar 20. "
"8489150","8492090"," When they pull back, they'll go down instead of to a dollar."
"8492290","8497330"," They'll go to like 90 cents and they'll pump up to a dollar and they'll pump go down to 80"
"8497330","8502010"," cents and they'll pump to 90 cents and they'll go down to 70 cents and they'll go to 80 cents"
"8502010","8507550"," and they'll go to 60 cents and they'll go to 70 cents and they'll go to 50 cents as an"
"8507550","8510970"," example, as an example."
"8511290","8514470"," And then eventually in the day, they're worth a penny or zero cents. "
"8515530","8522690"," So you have to know the baseline of the value of that, of whatever intrinsic value is left in that"
"8522690","8525510"," option, so that you're buying at the right time."
"8526650","8536450"," Tesla calls February 18th, 905C, 819,000 dollars, Misfit,"
"8536610","8541110"," MSFT, March 18th, 320C, 220,000 dollars."
"8547990","8551010"," So if you're playing zero dates, it's a very serious thing, right?"
"8551290","8558590"," You'll hear talk about, you'll hear talk about, you know, like zero dates are meant for, for"
"8558590","8563070"," arbitrage is meant for, like Wall Street betters and kids and stuff like that. "
"8563250","8569030"," But if you take it seriously, there's a lot of money to be made on these trades, like, you know,"
"8569110","8574550"," 50% in about three minutes, five minutes, 300% sometimes in 15 minutes."
"8575250","8581750"," So I watch them very closely and try to see when they become cheap again."
"8582570","8589710"," And what you're doing is you're like a vampire going in, in the mechanics of the options chain. "
"8590250","8596270"," And you're, you're not manipulating, but you're taking advantage of slippage, which is the same"
"8596270","8599230"," thing the market makers do in dealers, do the same shit."
"8605280","8606480"," They do it to you out there."
"8606660","8609280"," So that's all I'm doing is I'm skimming off the top. "
"8610960","8615080"," So you're the guy that's holding that option all day long, let's say you're like holding it from"
"8615080","8616200"," the nine 30 to four PM."
"8618520","8622840"," And there's people going in there and stealing money, the value away from that option."
"8622840","8628880"," Plus you've got people that have those selling and buying those options in spreads and complex"
"8628880","8630160"," strategies. "
"8630780","8637420"," So they're a vampire sucking the value of those options, like the sellers and the buyers, then you"
"8637420","8642180"," get the dealers and then you've got some arbitrage traders like me, I go in there and I take your"
"8642180","8642800"," money too."
"8648670","8650810"," Because you're the guy that's just holding them all day long."
"8662290","8666010"," Here's my speech on why zero dates and I complete degenerate behavior. "
"8666450","8668010"," That's only if you know what you're doing."
"8668790","8672290"," If you don't know what you're doing, you're going to get burned 99% of the time."
"8672830","8674430"," If you do know what you're doing, it's not so bad. "
"8675390","8676490"," It actually pays quite well."
"8677410","8682030"," Key is not to be like, if you make, if you spend a thousand bucks and you make 10 grand,"
"8682630","8683870"," don't go well in on 10 grand."
"8685010","8690790"," Because you're, you're going to have a rate of failure on those like, you know, you're going to"
"8690790","8692110"," fail like three to five times. "
"8692730","8695310"," So you got to make sure that a bunch of them counts for big rips."
"8700490","8702890"," Yeah, FRM is still on some kind of support here."
"8703510","8705730"," It's not the best short here, believe it or not. "
"8706750","8712530"," 4933, we're going to short it down to 48 bucks and you got $45 below that."
"8712530","8715710"," Not the best short out there is better."
"8718630","8725210"," We got FRM support pretty much of $48.45. See this wall of buyers right here at $45. "
"8726750","8728190"," So I guess, yeah, take it for five bucks."
"8729570","8731470"," There are better shorts out there than that though."
"8733490","8734350"," Way better shorts. "
"8739530","8740830"," The big move already happened."
"8752080","8763960"," So we are down below view up right now, trade"
"8763960","8764340"," them lower."
"8771120","8772600"," That's a good question too, Mero. "
"8772820","8773860"," We should talk about this stuff today."
"8775760","8777540"," Yeah, there's a selling program on right now."
"8778300","8779480"," We should talk about this stuff today. "
"8779640","8790710"," So, so I used to, there's a couple, there's a bunch of rules like, there's"
"8790710","8791830"," a bunch of shit, right?"
"8791950","8794490"," We had a sell program by program where we are in the charts."
"8795950","8796810"," Where's the interest?"
"8797550","8802090"," Often it's best to trade where most of the interest is, even on the spy."
"8802730","8805190"," You want to trade where they're buying back and forth. "
"8805490","8810150"," I will always watch the bots all day long to see if they're like, let's say today right now, look"
"8810150","8810530"," right now."
"8811950","8814530"," The bots are bouncing out, bouncing in between."
"8815930","8821640"," Now they, the bots were on 4.45s. Now they're gone. "
"8821920","8824560"," Now they're sitting on 4.48 P, right?"
"8825180","8834960"," It's going to get tighter as the day those calls were only worth 32 cents."
"8835240","8839080"," Right now I think they're using it so the market just doesn't fully fucking collapse at the moment."
"8839980","8843320"," I think there's a pin in the market intentionally right now. "
"8844120","8845920"," But anyways, the point is this."
"8846460","8852480"," So usually I'll be within like two to three strikes within the money."
"8854580","8857620"," And then if you watch them every single day of the week, you'll know when they're cheap and when"
"8857620","8858020"," they're expensive. "
"8859020","8864680"," Like an example would be, at the end of a day on Monday, at the end of that expiry, you'll"
"8864680","8868080"," see like three strikes away on a call."
"8868940","8874000"," If they're worth like two bucks or so on the spy, it doesn't matter where the price is."
"8874280","8876560"," They're like worth like two bucks, three bucks, they're pricey. "
"8877460","8882680"," They'll come down to like 60 cents on Tuesday at some point for Wednesday expiry."
"8883500","8887700"," So I'm always looking into the clothes to see if they dumped down to 60 cents real quick or not"
"8887700","8888760"," on a Monday."
"8889160","8895020"," Or if they're still crazy high, they'll then wait and notify them on Tuesday for like 60 cents. "
"8895600","8900580"," They like to see consistent pricing no matter where we are on the market on zero one two and three"
"8900580","8900760"," days."
"8901240","8905200"," So the longer you just watch the chains, the more familiar you become with what they should be"
"8905200","8905700"," priced at."
"8907040","8909680"," And then you'll also see premium kicks on these options. "
"8910900","8914580"," You'll see the you'll see spy trading down, but the price of spy is going up."
"8915580","8918840"," And no one will tell you no nothing out there can tell you that except for watching the chains."
"8919600","8923680"," So you'll be like, oh, there's a bunch of interest coming into these calls right now and nobody out"
"8923680","8924280"," there knows it. "
"8926140","8928080"," And so it's like a sneaky peat in the background."
"8928940","8932380"," The banks are blowing up on these on these calls knowing that the market's going to shift."
"8934060","8938000"," And so they're the first ones in, and then they move the market and you don't know why they're"
"8938000","8943480"," moving the market, but they know the banks do and the HFTs know that they're going to move the"
"8943480","8943760"," market. "
"8945540","8947860"," I should write all this stuff down and post it."
"8951510","8954730"," So my feeling is the 452s, they're going to kill them."
"8955590","8957750"," Like right now the 452s are now 28 cents. "
"8958690","8962670"," They're very cheap right now, but I have a feeling they're going to kill the call side and they're"
"8962670","8964750"," going to print the put side today."
"8965650","8966910"," That's what it looks like currently."
"8967890","8969210"," That's all subject to change. "
"8970430","8971590"," And they're already printing."
"8972190","8977090"," They've printed 450s, 449s, 448s on the put side."
"8977730","8980190"," They've printed all three of these so far on the put side. "
"8980810","8981870"," And there's like three more stacks."
"8982250","8985030"," There's a 447, 446, 445."
"8985770","8987690"," It looks like they want to print those as well. "
"8996200","8997280"," And we're going down."
"9000210","9000930"," See that?"
"9004780","9005740"," Fucking sickos."
"9006060","9007920"," These high frequency traders, man. "
"9008380","9015680"," These are like computer programs and these are banks that are, they want to print certain numbers"
"9016220","9017040"," on opaxes."
"9017800","9018820"," We're printing down now."
"9018920","9020280"," You guys see that nice fat print coming in?"
"9028980","9030660"," Yeah, I know I sell options too. "
"9031640","9035060"," I used to sell a lot of options when I owned stock."
"9037910","9040390"," And I don't own anymore stock right now currently."
"9040670","9042630"," I'm not a owner of stock right now. "
"9043570","9050550"," And I do a trade, butterflies, condors, broken wings, stuff like that."
"9052870","9059610"," But the way the way the market is right now, I think the risk level is too high generally for"
"9059610","9064070"," sellers of calls and puts."
"9064550","9066670"," I don't like the swings in the market right now. "
"9072410","9078390"," And I used to trade futures, but I don't like carrying that much weight around getting upside down."
"9078970","9080750"," So right now, my risk level is low."
"9083120","9084260"," I don't normally trade. "
"9084460","9085720"," So, as a matter of fact, this is crazy."
"9086360","9093120"," I just moved a bunch of money out of one brokerage or into one brokerage account, into a different"
"9093120","9096060"," brokerage account to exclusively trade zero dates."
"9098680","9101020"," And I'm actively seeking stocks to buy right now though. "
"9101380","9103960"," So, I've got that going on too."
"9104080","9105040"," I just haven't been comfortable."
"9105900","9109600"," I don't like telling my, I don't like telling any of you guys that I think we're going lower"
"9109600","9110980"," because I do. "
"9111120","9114600"," I think we're going, I think, I think we haven't hit bottom yet in the market for this year."
"9115560","9118080"," So, I don't want to push that viewpoint on anybody."
"9118080","9125460"," I think I do think we'll see 420 again and probably at least 390 again. "
"9126820","9133920"," So, before I buy anything, I don't feel like actively managing stocks right now until that happens."
"9139440","9143380"," But I'm not a, I'm frozen."
"9146170","9150290"," Yes, I'm not trying to, it's hard right now, Mero. "
"9150910","9160260"," I used to, I used to, I used to, um, Nvidia puts across the board, I mean, I'm puts across"
"9160260","9160680"," the board."
"9161140","9172010"," I used to, I used to trade safer and"
"9172010","9175590"," it's right now, it's hard to trade safer."
"9176730","9181570"," Like, I mean, I don't know, that's not the right, that's not the right viewpoint either to say"
"9181570","9181770"," that. "
"9181950","9190230"," Like, I think it's safer right now to trade, I think it's safer right now to trade with more for"
"9190230","9190430"," me."
"9191150","9197050"," It's safer for me to trade, uh, not, I don't like the idea of selling options right now, calls or"
"9197050","9198990"," puts, I think it's dangerous."
"9199710","9202550"," I think the Edigang's gotten fucked the past couple months. "
"9204110","9205010"," Am I still frozen?"
"9208200","9215900"," I never thought that I would be in this position either, where I'd be trading zero dates, one"
"9215900","9216720"," dates, three dates."
"9217360","9223180"," But like, you can't swing or trade right now, you can't actively buy stock right now."
"9223320","9225440"," In my view, I think that's super risky. "
"9226680","9238590"," I think, um, yeah, like I, I think this is a day trader's paradise right now, more"
"9238590","9248070"," so than ever any, anytime in the past, or that I can recall recently, and the VIX being elevated"
"9248070","9249030"," like it has been."
"9249870","9258340"," I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, for me it's dangerous."
"9263900","9271020"," Yeah, this is a day trading, I've never in my life traded more zero dates than recently. "
"9272840","9277600"," You're talking huge swings in the market, just ridiculous."
"9280340","9281520"," Oh yeah, how's that?"
"9281620","9283600"," How's that spy short going right now?"
"9283780","9285420"," Any of you guys jump in on those puts?"
"9286440","9288740"," When you guys jump in on those 4.45 boots?"
"9293680","9295460"," Can you guys take that trade?"
"9301340","9302720"," Did you guys take that trade?"
"9306500","9308980"," Those 4.45s are now 92 cents."
"9332100","9333120"," Yeah, it's not easy. "
"9334020","9336920"," I don't know how people are making it right now, Mayor, I'll be honest with you."
"9337320","9339240"," I don't know how people are making money right now."
"9339680","9342620"," This is the most, this is the toughest trading that's been going on. "
"9348950","9350170"," This has not been easy."
"9356650","9359890"," Yeah, selling Tesla puts on days like Tuesday, the nice yet."
"9360510","9362130"," Yeah, let's think about that, right?"
"9362350","9367490"," Like Tesla dude was trading, Tesla was like, just imagine the money, I agree that you can make a"
"9367490","9368890"," ton of money on Tesla puts right now. "
"9370170","9379010"," But then I'm on, then I'm on, like I watch Tesla every day and I'm like, man, every day I'm"
"9379010","9381290"," thinking like one of these days we're going to drop it."
"9381910","9386830"," Like next month, I can easily see Tesla dropping a 750."
"9388350","9388790"," Easy. "
"9390310","9392990"," So that I'm like, I can't sell puts on Tesla."
"9395830","9400830"," We're trading down now, look for 446.39 as a level of support."
"9402350","9405750"," You see this ice down here, I want to be careful of this ice if you're in put positions right"
"9405750","9405990"," now. "
"9406530","9411830"," You can take the money and run and then re-enter down to 4.45, just be conscious if you're"
"9411830","9416550"," in a put position right now that we're coming into the level of support."
"9417230","9417790"," Okay, they'll snatch."
"9419330","9422810"," Those zero-day puts are only good for the direction, the time of the move. "
"9424050","9428090"," Okay, that shit will snap back and your puts will be worthless."
"9430010","9438190"," So just, you know, we have more puts coming in right now, spy 211,450 p, $370,000, but you"
"9438190","9440530"," take your money and run here and then you re-enter again."
"9450950","9453370"," But like you make a trade, I mean, like let me ask you guys a question. "
"9453610","9456630"," So like this past week, okay, so mirror was just asking some questions."
"9456950","9457710"," Like why are you doing this?"
"9457810","9458330"," Why are you doing that?"
"9458550","9467870"," So I just, so in the past three or four weeks, I've made trades on five or six tickers at"
"9467870","9468670"," least, right?"
"9470150","9473230"," And it's been brutal."
"9474110","9478050"," Like you got to stay in them for days, weeks for 20, 30%. "
"9480490","9484510"," And then if, and then the way the markets move in, let's say you got to stay in that trade"
"9484510","9487550"," for a month, the three months, this fucking market's been all over the place."
"9488370","9489630"," So you might not even get a print."
"9490830","9492730"," It's like a hundred percent print, right?"
"9493050","9499110"," So I can go into spy right now and not fuck around with individual tickers. "
"9499110","9500890"," I'm following all of them, right?"
"9501050","9502250"," I want to know the impact on spy."
"9503070","9505570"," And then the other problem is there's no liquidity right now."
"9505610","9509670"," So there's no buyers or sellers for what you want to get into. "
"9511410","9514430"," So, or out of when it's time to get out of them."
"9515210","9516990"," So you're kind of locked into these trades."
"9517790","9525830"," So for me right now, I can go into the spy and make a fast 30% literally in minutes. "
"9527270","9530930"," I can, we saw that trade up high the other day, right?"
"9531110","9533110"," We went up fucking 50 points overnight."
"9534050","9535970"," We knew we were going up huge."
"9536210","9537150"," We're going to gap up overnight. "
"9537890","9540190"," We weren't guessing that we were going to gap up overnight."
"9541410","9547550"," So, you know, if you watch the spy all day long right now, you can make some serious money against"
"9547550","9549050"," any anything else out there."
"9549490","9553630"," Like you guys can look in though, you guys can look at 16,000 tickers and be like, oh look,"
"9553790","9555070"," SQ is squeezing today. "
"9555570","9557290"," Or oh look, a firm is squeezing today."
"9557610","9562250"," Or oh look, you know, asterisk squeezing today."
"9562790","9567290"," But the chance of you being in that stock as it squeezes is one out of a hundred. "
"9568390","9569450"," One out of a hundred."
"9570210","9574830"," All, and then you hear someone else say, I was in that trade, you know, and all those but you"
"9574830","9575330"," weren't right."
"9575470","9578070"," And you ever noticed that you typically you're not in those trades. "
"9579110","9584310"," So my point behind that is that every day I can go into the spy, most days, spy, I can"
"9584310","9590430"," go in there and I can make guaranteed a 20, 30, 100%, 80% or whatever."
"9592230","9593990"," And I don't have to trade my entire account."
"9594090","9597910"," It's like I'm going in here and trading a hundred thousand dollars every whack and burning a"
"9597910","9598590"," million dollar account. "
"9599130","9602390"," You know, I'm trading with one to ten thousand dollars per trade."
"9603930","9605650"," And that's a lot of money."
"9606990","9608710"," You know, that's a lot of money. "
"9613510","9617070"," And you don't have to take every single one of these trades, right?"
"9617230","9621610"," You just take one a day, one that you know is going to print, and then you walk away."
"9625410","9627410"," I just told you guys to close your positions, right?"
"9628770","9630430"," You should have closed your fucking puts."
"9639190","9639590"," That's right. "
"9650220","9650620"," Welcome."
"9652200","9653080"," And that's a living."
"9654660","9656900"," You make that trade once a day, once a week. "
"9657800","9658420"," You can be sitting."
"9659040","9662300"," I mean, and then there's the other thing right now, currently, you're stuck in some calls that"
"9662300","9666820"," you're upside down in or they're flat and you're will hope waiting for them to move in your"
"9666820","9667160"," direction."
"9667820","9673140"," Meanwhile, all the interest in your calls, let's say, let's say all the news breaks out on SQ. "
"9673760","9675200"," Hey, SQ's got news coming up tomorrow."
"9675200","9675940"," It's going to be awesome sauce."
"9676500","9679420"," And then no news comes out on SQ and you're loaded up on calls. "
"9680040","9684960"," And then all the, you know, like the new shiny object for kids, you're like, oh, now we're going to"
"9684960","9685520"," go look at PayPal."
"9685620","9689960"," And you're like, well, we'll come back here and ask you shine the light on me right now, because"
"9689960","9694080"," I'm locked in SQ and you're like, shit, they're not coming back."
"9694200","9695500"," And then they don't come back for like a month. "
"9696040","9700040"," And then all of a sudden you get more interest in SQ and your calls finally print or whatever it"
"9700040","9700620"," is you're doing."
"9702420","9704040"," You guys can make money on other shit too."
"9704220","9707940"," Like you go to like Clorox and shit like that, you guys put on some, you guys put on some"
"9707940","9713960"," condors on like, you guys find some stocks that never fucking move and you just throw some fucking"
"9713960","9717000"," butterflies on those things, you can sit back and make 20% in a week. "
"9717540","9717860"," Easy."
"9720890","9722070"," Just lay back and show."
"9723150","9726070"," Now me, I love all the action of the stock market. "
"9726250","9729050"," I love being, I like knowing everything that's going on in the stock market."
"9729230","9731830"," I like the interplay with all of you out there."
"9732030","9734190"," I like the interplay on Twitter. "
"9734590","9735210"," I like the action."
"9735430","9736550"," I like the risk."
"9736890","9738630"," I like, you know, this is what I like to do. "
"9739450","9740190"," This is my life."
"9740390","9740950"," This is my job."
"9741170","9742070"," This is all I do, right?"
"9742270","9744110"," This is my, I don't have a job or anything like that. "
"9744910","9750070"," I'm a pro, I'm not a professional, but I make my living by trading this market."
"9751510","9751870"," Right?"
"9752790","9753430"," What I do."
"9755450","9757050"," You guys take your money and run, right?"
"9758510","9760290"," Hey, Joey, I saw you couldn't get on. "
"9762570","9768530"," Oh, yeah, sizing risk management is all critical."
"9769430","9774410"," You guys can do basic math equations at home and figure out how many times you have to print."
"9774950","9778970"," Like if you guys, when you guys only take in 20, 30% off a trade, you got to win"
"9778970","9780170"," like nine out of 10 of those. "
"9781750","9784910"," So out of those nine out of 10, you have to have at least one or two bangers."
"9785170","9789710"," If not three bangers, right?"
"9789950","9794190"," You could take just one trade a week and just know it's going to be a banger."
"9794550","9799050"," You just watch the market for five straight days and be like, I'm waiting for that one trade this"
"9799050","9799270"," week. "
"9800570","9803310"," That one trade, I'm going to go all balls deep in on it."
"9804550","9805690"," Just sit here with me."
"9805730","9808330"," You could sit here with me five days a week, right?"
"9808590","9809370"," Not make one trade. "
"9810770","9816650"," And I know that some of you, I know some of you follow me and interact with me day in,"
"9816710","9818370"," day out every single day, right?"
"9818590","9819630"," We're always chatting with each other."
"9820890","9824610"," So I know that you could just sit in here all day long and I guarantee at least one point"
"9824610","9829930"," in this week, you could make one trade that you know is going to print fucking fat."
"9832370","9835170"," Because I know we do, I know we have some killer trades in here. "
"9835290","9835930"," We just had one."
"9836690","9839070"," So we have, we do have some killer trades in this room."
"9840910","9848620"," You just be patient and look for the next trade. "
"9849780","9851200"," You don't have to enter every single trade."
"9851400","9852380"," You don't have to always be in a trade."
"9852920","9858040"," Then let's just kick back, listen in, drink a bear, whiskey, whatever it is you do, fuck around on"
"9858040","9860720"," Twitter, keep my voice on in the background. "
"9862000","9866180"," And you know, if you hear me start talking about, you know, look at this trade right here, look at"
"9866180","9867060"," that trade right there."
"9867860","9874220"," And then as soon as all this volatility comes down, right, as soon as the Fed gives a roadmap and"
"9874220","9877400"," there's less volatility, we'll start trading basket of stocks."
"9878400","9880060"," I was thinking about this morning too. "
"9880220","9880900"," Mero was mentioning it."
"9881000","9885100"," Do I ever sell, uh, sell options and I'm like, I was thinking about it this morning because I'm"
"9885100","9887440"," like, I got to start talking to you guys about that stuff."
"9888120","9891220"," But right now is not the right time to be talking about that stuff. "
"9891940","9895300"," For me, at least it isn't, right?"
"9895540","9896340"," You have a swing here."
"9896560","9897980"," Let's look at the last month, right?"
"9898580","9900100"," We've had a range this whole month."
"9902340","9904200"," From 420 to 460. "
"9906620","9907320"," That's brutal."
"9909240","9910760"," Like that is straight brutal."
"9912120","9913480"," That's some gnarly shit. "
"9916040","9916480"," Gnarly."
"9919580","9920540"," Straight gnarly."
"9925970","9926790"," It's gnarly. "
"9927590","9930790"," Remember back in the day and not the back of the day, the last two years, you could, you could"
"9930790","9931710"," have bought that dip at 420."
"9933290","9934650"," He's read that thing all the way up."
"9935270","9936090"," All-time highs. "
"9936690","9936930"," Boom."
"9939810","9942450"," Instead, we, we traded from 420 for one day."
"9942510","9944150"," We have our banner rally for one day. "
"9944550","9945870"," We used to have them for three days."
"9946150","9947250"," One day were banner rally."
"9947390","9948470"," Not even our true banner rallies. "
"9948670","9949870"," More was just short covering."
"9950310","9951690"," Then we traded down the next day."
"9951890","9953110"," Then we traded up the next day. "
"9953490","9954950"," Then we traded down for three days."
"9955470","9956750"," Then we traded up for three days."
"9956950","9958490"," Then we traded sideways and up for a day. "
"9959110","9959310"," The 460."
"9960130","9962550"," We sold the world down for three more days."
"9962550","9964610"," Traded sideways for three days. "
"9965110","9967250"," Then we did a gap up overnight, right?"
"9967350","9968850"," We're all like, ooh, this pumping."
"9969350","9970610"," Now we're selling down again."
"9972290","9973090"," This is insane. "
"9973430","9974050"," This is insanity."
"9974850","9975850"," This is pure insanity."
"9978370","9979690"," Pure insanity right now. "
"9980530","9981890"," I'd be, I'd be scared of death."
"9982150","9984950"," You should, like, let's further, let's go take this further."
"9985610","9987390"," You know, you see me Kevin getting out of the market?"
"9990330","9993230"," No one in the line?"
"9994130","9995730"," I don't blame him. "
"9996070","10000070"," Like the, like the panic that that guy must be feeling right now is, is big."
"10001690","10006290"," You know, I don't know that I agree with everything he's saying right now, but the guy's got"
"10006290","10008530"," legitimate reason for wanting to protect his wealth."
"10008770","10010990"," I don't blame that guy for wanting to protect his wealth. "
"10012130","10012810"," I don't blame it."
"10013170","10014730"," I don't blame one, one single bit."
"10015930","10017650"," No need to be given it away right now. "
"10018730","10022230"," If we make all-time highs, he can get back in the market long."
"10022710","10028910"," He doesn't need all this from, he doesn't need to make anything in the market from here to 480."
"10029590","10031490"," And he would still be as good. "
"10033170","10036430"," He'd be just right back where he started when we started selling the market off."
"10039790","10040950"," So what does he do?"
"10041210","10043230"," He, he, he misses a little bit of the market."
"10043430","10043830"," That's fine. "
"10044770","10049590"," To sleep every night, like with, with not panicking every single night and sweats."
"10050630","10052830"," Like shit, are we going to sell off in the middle of the night?"
"10053010","10056490"," Like shit, are we going to, are we going to have this moment in the market where we fucking, you"
"10056490","10059550"," know, this, this stupid sell off where you're never recovering?"
"10060150","10064190"," You're literally not going to financially recover from losing 15 million dollars."
"10064850","10065530"," Fuck that. "
"10067130","10067830"," Fuck that."
"10068750","10071170"," Turn the fucking, the meat Kevin channels show off."
"10072010","10072770"," Keep your money. "
"10073090","10073670"," Take a vacation."
"10074370","10074470"," Chill."
"10075290","10078530"," And then come back to the market when all this volatility is over. "
"10080290","10083150"," Like that guy has, he doesn't have no, no need."
"10087200","10087660"," I don't know."
"10087760","10088180"," What's his name?"
"10088340","10088800"," I forget his name. "
"10102360","10106000"," Yeah, I mean, if anything, he's teaching a lesson to buy the dippers."
"10106600","10113220"," If anything, he's teaching a lesson, a hard lesson to buy the dippers that were not in Kansas"
"10113220","10113600"," anymore."
"10116240","10118400"," When this market will go up, we will be green on the year. "
"10119060","10126880"," It'll be a moment where we're not involved, we're not profitable."
"10128600","10129780"," And I'm shocked at that."
"10130020","10131440"," You know, that guy didn't have to do that guy. "
"10131520","10136020"," I'm telling you right now that guy could have sat here, right and bought every fucking dip."
"10136960","10141420"," And even if it sold down, he could have not bought the dip and said he was buying the dip,"
"10141420","10142560"," right?"
"10142760","10145600"," And then he could have a pity party when the stock burns every day."
"10146200","10151200"," Just do those videos and make bank, bank off just that right there. "
"10151360","10152460"," And he does, he's not doing that."
"10152540","10154920"," So I give him a lot of respect for what he's doing right now."
"10154940","10155680"," I used to not like him. "
"10155740","10157320"," And I have a lot more respect for him than I ever did."
"10162000","10164000"," All right, let's see if this is a real dip."
"10164000","10168470"," I looks like it doesn't it?"
"10168590","10170590"," I don't see the sellers up here. "
"10173150","10174430"," I ain't seeing the sellers."
"10181140","10186320"," And then the worst part is all of his all of his compadres out there, he's got like a bunch"
"10186320","10190740"," of people that mimic him out there on YouTube, like they try to be the other cabin or whatever."
"10191160","10192540"," Some of them try to sound smart. "
"10192720","10194640"," Some of them try to look more more sleazy."
"10195580","10197040"," And they're all pissed off at him."
"10198360","10202020"," Because they're probably, you know, because it's fucking with their gym, right?"
"10202800","10207180"," They don't care if the market goes up or goes down, they're just selling a dream to everybody,"
"10207180","10207580"," right?"
"10208320","10211740"," Now they're all pissed off at them, they can go get fucked every single last one of them. "
"10218580","10220240"," We're trading the pyre now, right?"
"10221580","10223580"," I don't see any sellers here either."
"10231930","10234090"," No, you're not looking for reentry inputs right now."
"10236860","10237640"," It's true, right?"
"10239820","10241440"," Yeah, Kevin, a path graph. "
"10250310","10251650"," Yeah, that's true too, Henry."
"10251730","10253590"," I agree with that on the wash sail rule."
"10257220","10258380"," I used to not like him a lot. "
"10258380","10263800"," I used to have I used to be really offended by him because I've I felt like he I felt"
"10263800","10269120"," it felt like, you know, like a lot of what, you know, there's a whole bunch of white in like"
"10269120","10273820"," him, but I am I got to give you dig, you got to give it to the guy right now."
"10274920","10279640"," You have to because you never would have experienced some people are like, well, he's going to get"
"10279640","10282160"," in trouble for pumping stocks or something."
"10282160","10283560"," He ain't getting in no trouble by anybody. "
"10285690","10290320"," He uh, I give him a lot of respect for that right now."
"10292080","10293720"," I can change my viewpoint on people."
"10297830","10304930"," He's teaching a good lesson to investors and start getting some turnier, he's got a large audience"
"10304930","10306350"," of people that can listen to him. "
"10306590","10309170"," He's probably saving a lot of accounts in the long run."
"10311130","10312910"," You know, we you know, we're out there, right?"
"10313090","10316690"," We we're out we think we're the best and we're savvy and all that we used to make fun of"
"10316690","10316830"," them."
"10317650","10320630"," And because of, you know, what was going on, right?"
"10320810","10322550"," And then all of a sudden, he says, Nope, not anymore. "
"10323290","10327690"," You have to give him a minute there to at least some credit there."
"10327830","10328630"," You have to give him some credit."
"10330350","10332050"," Can't just always beat people up. "
"10334640","10340120"," And rightfully so, he deserved the mockery, but not for what he's doing right now."
"10342700","10346060"," And the mockery that he's getting is from fucking sin, not sick of fans."
"10346260","10352520"," They're like slumped scumbags and they give really bad advice. "
"10359020","10360080"," That was a nice trade, right?"
"10360220","10361120"," That was a nice little trade down."
"10364770","10366190"," I didn't take the trade up here."
"10366510","10367710"," I want to see what happens here. "
"10369150","10370410"," That might take a long here."
"10372390","10373470"," Wait and see what happens."
"10373710","10374850"," I don't know that I'd take a short here. "
"10386590","10417930"," Let's look closer and see 446."
"10418910","10420310"," I don't think it's going that low."
"10423830","10434150"," Maybe still that buyer is resting down at 445 Tesla calls, Marvel calls, Marvel"
"10434150","10439690"," MRVL 318 75 c half million m u high. "
"10439770","10440170"," I'll go score."
"10451220","10455060"," So we should do is for me, I think it's March 18th."
"10455380","10461760"," I think the first round of stocks the time we can buy stock is probably March 18th. "
"10461780","10466220"," Once we're done with FOMC and we get we better get clarity."
"10466660","10467340"," This is the one thing."
"10467460","10470020"," This is the last part of this whole conversation too about stocks. "
"10471880","10473480"," Until we get some clarity, right?"
"10474280","10475160"," We can't buy it."
"10475160","10477020"," I don't think you can invest in this market."
"10477240","10483260"," I think that you need to have the Fed definitively say, this is what we're doing. "
"10483640","10489260"," I'll tell you what, if the fucking Fed says something stupid like, you know, inflation is"
"10489260","10494000"," transitory and we're not raising rates or anything like that, anything that isn't concrete like,"
"10494000","10495600"," this is what we're doing."
"10496540","10497500"," I think it's risky."
"10497780","10498340"," The market's risky. "
"10503910","10508150"," Now I do think if they if they tell you, if they if they if they ever came out and"
"10508150","10511630"," said we're out doing anything in March, this market's going to go to fucking all time eyes."
"10512210","10515290"," Like same day, that shit will take like three days."
"10518450","10521230"," We will blast the fuck off to the top guaranteed. "
"10522130","10527230"," If they post anything kind of stroker, any kind of stroker bullshit, that shouldn't happen."
"10527810","10529690"," So they better come out with something in March."
"10530470","10532090"," The market's been fucking waiting. "
"10534910","10537250"," All right, spy calls February 11th."
"10537250","10538530"," This looks very bullish right here."
"10539250","10541410"," February 11th, 4, 4, 7, C."
"10547010","10549610"," Those are our $2.26 right now. "
"10554250","10566610"," I'm probably going to grab some $4.50 XLF"
"10566610","10566910"," puts."
"10567790","10570110"," Now they're at 79 cents right now."
"10570130","10574450"," So I'm going to look from the B about 60 cents to 65 cents. "
"10574570","10578750"," If I can catch them somewhere down in here, there's currently 77 cents."
"10579610","10581110"," We'll see if we can get it a little bit cheaper."
"10589820","10591060"," I don't think I'm going to get them cheaper. "
"10607860","10611920"," Some light XLF and spy puts coming in and QQQ puts coming in."
"10614160","10615620"," XLF, I already told you about those."
"10615800","10622540"," Those are April 14th, 40p and then spy 211 for 445p for $65,000. "
"10623440","10628880"," The spy calls were $211,000 versus the 65 and then some QQQ puts."
"10629640","10634520"," Those are February 16th, 351p for $260,000."
"10662590","10664190"," Oh, figuring out money's in there. "
"10665690","10666750"," Hey Mike, how are you?"
"10667150","10667610"," How's it going?"
"10672980","10674940"," How are you doing, Mike?"
"10676920","10677780"," Everything's going well."
"10678080","10678860"," Sorry I wasn't reading the chat."
"10679060","10682940"," I was paying attention to the chains real quick, the options chains. "
"10684780","10685800"," It's going well today."
"10686000","10693240"," We've taken a, we took a short, we took a couple quick zero dates and then we took that quick"
"10693240","10696080"," short down into the European close."
"10697720","10699220"," Now we're looking to find out. "
"10700160","10702460"," I think this is going to be one of those quiet days."
"10711300","10717660"," Yeah, figuring out if you guys haven't tuned in to figuring out money, it gives great market"
"10717660","10723440"," overview and the direction of the markets every single night, five nights a week."
"10726210","10728510"," Do you see the rotation taking place in the market today?"
"10729030","10741700"," Mike, we're kind"
"10741700","10743160"," of diddling in the middle right now. "
"10743500","10744720"," Mike probably knows that."
"10754900","10756000"," We need some movements."
"10756360","10756860"," We need to get it. "
"10756920","10762680"," We need to get above 460 or below 435 for a market direction."
"10766070","10767890"," You did take long on XLU yesterday."
"10767950","10768390"," Nice. "
"10769070","10770630"," Did you grab that right before the close?"
"10774290","10775830"," Yeah, I like the XLU trade."
"10776450","10778350"," I like XLP and XLV right now too."
"10781570","10785730"," And then they pumped a bunch of bean down stocks and then trapped everybody. "
"10791530","10793510"," We were covering XLU this morning."
"10796680","10797660"," Yeah, he's awesome."
"10802260","10803540"," They're not selling the market. "
"10804540","10806800"," Yeah, they're not selling the market, Mike."
"10807300","10808940"," They are rotating into it."
"10809100","10809800"," You can see it. "
"10811880","10816680"," When they're rotated into, today they rotated in XLP."
"10817300","10822100"," XLU looked like end XLV or at least it looks like they are."
"10825730","10828010"," Yeah, I like that idea of the defense of posturing. "
"10836920","10838580"," We looked at all three of those this morning."
"10845260","10847280"," They're not selling XLF off today."
"10848280","10850020"," So it's not like we're going to burn the market. "
"10850160","10851840"," It doesn't look like we're going to burn the market as of yet."
"10853520","10855800"," I do like the XLU play."
"10872360","10875120"," It looks like Mike that we've got support down below at 445. "
"10876340","10878500"," The standing buyers down below here."
"10878720","10880360"," Next big level Mike is 435."
"10880920","10881900"," You probably already know that. "
"10882240","10883420"," 435 is zero."
"10891570","10893670"," You took a stab at the long and the queues."
"10900260","10903920"," I couldn't get the right price on the spy and to the close yesterday. "
"10904900","10906140"," So I stayed out of it."
"10906680","10916500"," I sat on my hands into the close and then Mero was talking"
"10916500","10922900"," about I was hoping with all the manipulation in the overnight and yesterday that we might if we"
"10922900","10928260"," were pinned down at the at the open this morning down like 0.8% 0.8% or 1 "
"10928260","10930420","% I would have taken along there."
"10931160","10933220"," But they stuck us right in the middle for OPEX. "
"10934760","10937480"," In reality thing where are we at right?"
"10938560","10941920"," We're not going to know until we're above 460 or below 435."
"10942920","10943080"," Zero."
"10944060","10945440"," Like right in the middle. "
"10948020","10949880"," Not a bad place to straddle the market though."
"10951160","10951840"," To be honest."
"10956200","10957040"," Right where we are. "
"10957320","10959040"," No matter which way we're moving we're in one of those directions."
"10976300","10978140"," Yeah iron condors are good trade today."
"10980760","10982440"," As long as we don't sell off into the close. "
"10984940","10986420"," She cut one leg off of that."
"10992360","10996780"," We've got no news on Monday but supposedly we've got one of the Fed Presidents talking on Monday"
"10996780","10997080"," morning."
"10998020","11002840"," I think we've got a speech. "
"11003280","11005020"," It does not show up on one of my calendars."
"11007900","11011360"," I think Bernard speaking in the morning 830 there's nothing else."
"11011560","11016320"," There's not a ton on Monday's calendar but we do have a vault a week ahead of us plus OPEX. "
"11018200","11022600"," My thought is that we trade sideways and down and then we have one one fat one one update next"
"11022600","11023400"," week on like Thursday."
"11026360","11027180"," That's my take."
"11035740","11037620"," Yeah stayed real safe on the downward leg. "
"11039480","11046790"," Yeah let's talk about golden tickets real quick."
"11047050","11047910"," You guys ready for golden ticket?"
"11048390","11049190"," We'll talk about golden tickets."
"11050570","11054050"," Let's talk about some boards on CNBC Monday morning. "
"11055490","11057470"," Let's talk about golden tickets."
"11058310","11059670"," I'll do some quick for it okay."
"11064590","11070290"," Okay let's talk golden tickets while we're hanging out here while the market's not doing too much. "
"11071330","11072550"," Let's talk about a golden ticket."
"11075990","11076950"," Good question."
"11081080","11082940"," So we're going to talk about golden tickets. "
"11090240","11091660"," Let's talk about golden tickets."
"11092480","11100580"," Okay so let's say you have, hold on, I think we're getting some kind of news here."
"11102680","11105300"," Not much news today either news is quiet today. "
"11109150","11116350"," Saying that Brazil Central Bank Governor Campos is going to a lead in monetary tightening as I"
"11116350","11118530"," believe inflation had a more persistent element."
"11120290","11125610"," Which lends itself to more oh we got a nice green bar on the spy here."
"11127310","11138020"," Okay so the golden ticket comes in okay and the trend of that ticker it's"
"11138020","11145720"," trending down let's say let's say ticker xyz and let's say a five million dollar five like let's"
"11145720","11154740"," say it's a million dollar call right and it's dated for oh right let's compare right let's say it's"
"11154740","11164520"," February 11th and this is uh December right it's January right this is February"
"11164520","11172700"," now you see a million dollar call come in right and this ticker is going to the best"
"11172700","11181560"," way to be doing this let's say the ticker has been you know just trading down let's say right it's"
"11181560","11189340"," a million dollar call come in you'll what you should be doing is just keeping a ledger of that call"
"11189340","11194400"," coming in right you get a piece of paper and pen write it down and you're waiting you're not going"
"11194400","11199720"," to buy right when that call comes in you're going to wait for you're going to snap yourself a line"
"11199720","11207300"," right and you're going to wait for that for that ticker to trade sideways say it's like a three"
"11207300","11212020"," month old call you let wait for trade sideways here and once it breaks through that resistance"
"11213140","11219660"," right you're going to check back on that specific ticker and if it if there's still long in it and"
"11219660","11224660"," we still let's say a month left in that call you'll then enter does that make sense you then follow"
"11224660","11231920"," that that call right and the second thing that I would say to you let's say it was dated for"
"11231920","11242480"," March 31st let's say the call was a hundred C for March 31st I would then probably"
"11242480","11250440"," buy slightly more in the money and then maybe date it slightly passed wherever the strike is so if"
"11250440","11255560"," it's March 31st I probably did it for like two weeks later and slightly more in the money and that"
"11255560","11261800"," does a few things right what it does is if if there's a market condition where this guy's this big"
"11261800","11267880"," baller needs to roll it out an extra two weeks or so or has or we have a market dip"
"11267880","11273700"," or something right then he can reposition himself but you're kind of already there and then I would"
"11273700","11279860"," always be picking uh like round numbers five zero stuff like that so whenever they get back in if"
"11279860","11290230"," they do get back in they're kind of work close to where you are next thing on next important"
"11290230","11300100"," part let's say that say golden take comes in we're trading up like this okay drop down up"
"11300100","11309160"," or down right or up or down or up or down or up right because the nice beautiful uh"

"11355740","11363620"," just gonna find find a support level right you're gonna set an alert and then what if like when we"
"11363620","11368780"," come back down here even if we start going higher here you're gonna see if we trade back down and"
"11368780","11375400"," if we do trade back down and your alert goes off and those and those calls are still active right"
"11375400","11380440"," there's still interest in those calls they haven't sold their position that's when you jump on"
"11380440","11385800"," board down here now you now every single golden ticket might not do this for you some of these"
"11385800","11389940"," golden tickets are just gonna go to the moonshot and you're gonna miss that trade but if you want a"

"12058100","12065140"," to be at 880 and now they're at 850 that's a tough call right here if you're a bull though"

"12087980","12096920"," the ramp of the next quarters er season will be enough put a three-month call spread on them it's"

"12218970","12228410"," tesla went up to $1,600 you're basically as a stockholder saying i see tesla at $1,600"
"12228410","12236170"," even if it stays at 900 from now until june that's a fairly good return right now i wouldn't put"
"12236170","12246190"," all my money into that trade but you know throw 10 grand at it or something now"
"12246190","12252210"," you probably will at some point experience volatility between now and that time period but if"
"12252210","12259050"," you're like you know if your viewpoint on the market is tesla's not going down to 750 because i"
"12259050","12267110"," know some of you think they never go into 750 but we're at 880 right now so you could probably"
"12267110","12273990"," we could swing down 50 points we swing down 100 points on tesla right all the time so if you"
"12273990","12283950"," think this is bottom uh tesla 890 895 c for june 17 230 dollars pays"
"12285830","12295230"," 270 dollars and all you got to do is be above 895 that's it that's all you have to be"

"12335620","12343140"," pretty good gain right and the best part is that well the only thing you have to consider is that"
"12343140","12351000"," the the banks are taking out hedges at 400 in may just be conscious of that the banks have hedges"
"12351000","12355440"," down to 390 in today they do they just bought them the other day they bought them when we were"
"12355440","12365040"," at 460 and then the only other thing you'd have to ask yourself is are we at risk see the"
"12365040","12369820"," same that he's currently betting on 25 base point hike in march so he's about a one third chance"
"12369820","12374640"," for 50 base point hike ooh links to two year would probably have to go another 25 base points"
"12374640","12379720"," higher for the fed to go 50 base points in their rate move we're gonna get we're gonna get a"

"12435850","12446660"," kiwi about a year ago I think we all agree with that but he's saying"
"12446660","12458420"," that the risk is on uh doing it a quick dump here let's see if we rip higher look"
"12458420","12465640"," at I don't know why we care about if it's 50 or 25 I think the I don't think it"
"12465640","12481080"," really matters I just think that they're using it for volatility's sake so"
"12481080","12486280"," there's a bunch of stuff about so the good thing is this if the spread goes the wrong way on"
"12486280","12492680"," you you can sell depending on what kind you get uh you can sell legs on them uh if you"

"25002570","25012350"," if we sold 435 into monday uh over war you're talking about uh my assumption is"
"25012350","25021030"," that we would go to 420 and if we went to 420 then you would probably have a national crisis"
"25021030","25028110"," you would destroy a lot of american business i could be wrong on this unless it's something planned"
"25028110","25034370"," that's not known i would think that you would destroy 20 percent of the banking system in the u.s"
