"83340","84460"," Ah, fuck that."
"84580","85480"," We'll just get right into it."
"85520","86720"," It's already 9.30 this morning. "
"88040","92810"," I'm running a little late right now, so we'll just get right into this."
"92870","93890"," We're going to skip the intro."
"94710","95910"," Just get right into the open. "
"95930","102460"," It's already 39.30. Take a look right here."
"102960","108100"," I'm going to just drop real quick over here for you if you are out there trying to trade this"
"108100","109040"," open this morning."
"110780","112540"," I'm going to take a quick look. "
"116410","119050"," You can just see this decline going back this whole week."
"119210","123490"," We've got one touch here, another touch here on the 26th."
"123970","131950"," If you're looking for a pivot today or a place to take long here today, you are going to be"
"131950","134730"," looking for a break above this yellow line right here. "
"134810","136890"," Let me see if I can get the missing, let's see if I can highlight this here."
"139590","140490"," Let's see if I make this thicker."
"142930","143790"," It will change the color. "
"144790","147730"," Kind of like your go blue color today."
"148170","154610"," If you want to take a long, you want to see a break above this pivot point here."
"154610","160210"," If there's some rejection off of the open this morning, something like this, we come back down and"
"160210","163710"," just recheck this previous low down here at 413. "
"164130","165210"," There's another mark down here."
"166070","171330"," Some traders will end up taking a, let's see if I can get rid of this color here."
"172490","176250"," Some traders will tell you that you have to check just the clothes here. "
"176570","178390"," There's another mark down below 413."
"179390","183530"," The other key note this morning is, can you guys hear me out there?"
"183650","184550"," I don't know if you can or can't."
"185670","187470"," I think I got a weird mic this morning too. "
"189070","193110"," But anyway, if you wanted a pivot moment, take this long, right?"
"193290","195350"," You'd want to see us trade above here, right?"
"195450","198030"," A couple taps and then we, then we, then we, we, we cream higher."
"198970","205070"," And we'll talk about, we'll talk about making some channels here for going up this morning as well."
"206290","213050"," Another key point about this morning is that support, I want you to know that support is much lower"
"213050","214130"," this morning than yesterday. "
"214630","221870"," Even if we trade higher, I want you to see that key support for today is below it for 10."
"222370","223650"," Let's just be aware of that."
"223850","229770"," If we do reverse course and head lower, you can get burned in this moment in here. "
"229950","235770"," Okay, so if we were to, if we were to have a fake, a fake breakout, reverse course down for"
"235770","236170"," a tag."
"237190","242870"," If the bull, if the bears are just waiting in this channel for you to take longs, then we reverse"
"242870","244010"," and sell it down."
"245710","247150"," You can wind up seeing a tag below. "
"247510","250210"," This would fuck you up if you're trying to get long this morning."
"250730","254510"," So with that being said, you are looking for a break above this channel."
"254970","259050"," You're going to be looking for one or two taps and then it's going to trade higher. "
"259529","259529"," Okay."
"260290","267750"," Now our one is also considered key resistance today, even though our two is above at the top of the"
"267750","268070"," channel."
"268510","270510"," So I want you to be aware of that as well. "
"270890","276500"," Even in here, this is considered key resistance today."
"276960","283020"," And this is channel above."
"283940","285700"," So where does that leave you this morning?"
"286420","288280"," Is that is the big question, right?"
"288740","290880"," It's a it's a tough place to be this morning. "
"292220","298040"," If you're if you are super duper bullish and we go up, you're going to look like you are a"
"298040","299120"," rock star this morning."
"301610","308130"," If you if we don't trade higher here or if we reverse course at any point, we've got this at"
"308130","310470"," 419 down there seems to be 420."
"311350","316450"," If you are a rock star, if you're like, Hey, I'm calling this long today cap, I'm going super hella"
"316450","316890"," long here. "
"317990","319070"," There are some pitfalls."
"319430","321650"," You first off have this resistance point here."
"322090","325070"," And then this 420 is a hard resistance currently. "
"325370","326970"," We'll take a look at it on book map this morning."
"327350","331310"," So there are some points in here where you can get kind of fucked up, right?"
"331470","334090"," There's like resistance here and here."
"334210","337450"," We'll take a look at both these points right now on book map. "
"337450","340450"," We'll come back to this to this chart."
"342470","347050"," And you got this little bit of resistance right in here, 419 for 1950."
"348310","350090"," And then above again, at 420. "
"350850","355230"," You want to be watching this for a rejection for hidden sellers."
"355970","361770"," If these hidden sellers don't come in to play, you would be safe above here."
"361850","362570"," I want you to see this. "
"363110","365350"," These hidden sellers that are hidden in here right now."
"365950","369450"," Okay, if you want to stay here, I want to take this, this, this trade and make it safe."
"370130","371090"," It's above this 420. "
"372050","377890"," Okay, you get some more, some more sellers I've had for 42150 and see them ready to feed in."
"378310","382750"," But the reality is for a bullish stance today, you want to be watching."
"385240","386980"," I'm just going to break this down for a little bit. "
"387760","390220"," You can see also some support down below at 416."
"391320","394640"," So you can mark that on your charts and some nice buyers down here."
"394860","396260"," This looks bullish to me. "
"398440","400560"," And then firm support down here at 410."
"400900","402820"," I just want you to be aware of the levels this morning."
"403380","408160"," I want you to see the support that's stepping in the sellers that are stepping in as we move the"
"408160","408580"," day forward. "
"408820","413320"," Also, just briefly, care indicator is turning a little bit negative at this point, but I don't"
"413320","413860"," think it matters."
"415000","416760"," I think the bulls want to show up today."
"417320","423100"," Let's bring this up for you today. "
"423240","429440"," Just know that there are bears hiding in here wanting to take this short even though you want to"
"429440","429980"," take it long."
"430260","434500"," Now we have lots of buyers stepping in right now in the market."
"434880","438020"," This could squeeze higher this morning. "
"439080","443160"," Personally, I was going to take a trade right off the bell this morning, but you know, I just don't"
"443160","444140"," need this."
"444140","445180"," I just don't need this."
"445940","452460"," It's always I always feel like a cotton is in these situations where I know we're going up and it's"
"452460","453220"," high risk. "
"454200","456820"," Now with that being said, let's say we trade up higher today."
"457340","458620"," Let's say the bulls are in charge."
"458640","461200"," We get a really nice fat relief really rally this morning. "
"461840","462580"," We end up going up."
"462720","469020"," It's deservedly so if you look back at the decline, it's been huge, right huge decline in the"
"469020","469340"," market."
"469760","471840"," Huge reversal down below here. "
"472620","476400"," And there should be some sort of we had two down 90 days."
"476400","478060"," We should have an update today."
"478860","483220"," With that being said, reversing course is easy here today. "
"484340","488480"," And you saw the the huge rally we had in here."
"489000","492280"," This this turnaround of events right was was nasty."
"493300","498340"," So even with a blast off today, I would be concerned remember that member says blue light remember"
"498340","499800"," that previous reversal zone. "
"500400","505820"," I would be real concerned with this effect here somewhere down in here."
"507460","512360"," Somewhere here and let's say I say fuck you, Cap, we're going straight to the fucking moon up here."
"512900","516440"," Any of the any of these rallies should be short lived. "
"517280","522179"," So I would not that was I posted this on at Cap's office morning and that would still mean that"
"522179","529420"," if even if we have a successful rally here, I would still be on the side of caution saying this"
"529420","530240"," is market bottom."
"530580","532940"," Now you can you can trade this rally up."
"533360","537480"," But the start to even begin to think about the market being bullish. "
"538440","541180"," We're talking about breaking out of this negative channel as a first step."
"541600","542560"," It's not down here."
"542700","543820"," It's not where we are right here. "
"544100","545820"," And we've seen people get fucked up in here."
"546820","555180"," Option C in this whole entire thing would be that we trade slot sideways and slightly down until we"
"555180","556020"," get to Apple MC."
"556280","564020"," If this takes place, if you look back on that January, it was last week of January, bulls and bears"
"564020","569680"," got pretty fucked up in that in that in that zone, this top best that took place. "
"570600","572260"," Then we could trade out of the bounds a little bit."
"572280","575200"," We could trade below bounds a little bit as we head into FMC."
"575380","579980"," But if you get caught up in this, the key is that you could you could just trade this reactionary"
"579980","585240"," that rather than saying I'm buying law, I'm going long way at the bell, you could wait to pick it"
"585240","587500"," up here and then start shorting and then buy the dips down below. "
"588860","590060"," These moves are swift."
"590260","592640"," Or when they took place in January, they were swift."
"592940","597940"," I mean, we looked if any of you guys remember trading that, we were bullish as fuck, right?"
"598220","600920"," And it would be like a steep drop off right into the bell. "
"602040","606380"," And then if you didn't buy the bell, it would go steeply up into the next day."
"606620","608700"," So it was wild trading."
"608960","610140"," It was not for the faint of heart. "
"610480","615880"," As a matter of fact, yeah, I know there was a huge decline in 2020 and individual stock tickers."
"616500","622140"," But when bulls really got fucked up and even some bears, believe it or not, was that first decline"
"622140","628980"," we had back in January, we'll look at that right now just just as the option C in this thought"
"628980","629480"," process."
"631140","633200"," We'll head back over the thought experiment. "
"635420","636760"," And it was right in here."
"636900","640340"," Okay, we had this huge decline off the off the first of the month."
"640340","645880"," We get down below here and this chop fest, it doesn't look like much now, but I promise you, when"
"645880","647100"," it was going on, right?"
"648100","650740"," We're talking about some fucking massive moves. "
"651320","655960"," They don't look big, but they're giant for 20 to 440, right?"
"656180","662820"," Straight back down here to 427, a move higher to 440, and then a sell off, right?"
"663400","667480"," Then you have to literally buy at 450 in the afternoon, just the catches."
"667840","673380"," And the crazy part about this trade, if I was to make these bars smaller, was that if you, let's"
"673380","677420"," say you didn't monetize your trade, right?"
"677540","679380"," And you panic sold down below here."
"679920","686760"," We went back up that day and you would, let's say you're up like 300, 600%, and you panic sold"
"686760","688220"," for like 100% or even less. "
"689860","694000"," Imagine the crushing defeat you fell at the end of the day knowing that you still could have"
"694000","695460"," monetize later on in the afternoon."
"695860","698500"," This was like, this was demoralizing to bulls."
"699120","704940"," And then of course that second, this second rip higher, would you have known to sell to monetize"
"704940","705420"," that point?"
"705940","709700"," Because what we ended up doing was fucking going to the depths of hell that same day. "
"710000","714760"," This was a wild trading day and the week overall wound up with us slamming down."
"715840","721600"," I just imagine if you didn't see this out of the screen over here, imagine if you didn't see this"
"721600","723460"," part of the screen, I'm telling you, right?"
"723580","727080"," When you saw this down below, it was like, oh, fuck, where are you going to the depths of hell"
"727080","727380"," today?"
"727820","728800"," Is the market going to crash?"
"729120","735380"," So I just want to bring this back up because this zone here, right, is that option C for us"
"735380","736700"," heading into FOMC."
"737140","742940"," And you will oftentimes within these trading zones, here, bear is telling you, well, we're going to"
"742940","744240"," fucking 360 down here. "
"744320","745600"," We're going to 360 down here."
"745660","746940"," We're going to 360 down here."
"747360","752240"," You'll also hear bears are bulls in here saying, all time highs are coming, all time highs are"
"752240","752500"," coming. "
"753120","758040"," And it's, you know, five days later, you fucked up your account like fucking, you just torn through"
"758040","764800"," 60% of your account, 30% of your account, like giant fucking, giant fucking rips into your account."
"765280","772300"," Just be aware of that as we trade forward, that there is some real danger in some violent moves in"
"772300","773420"," these next couple days."
"775920","781360"," Just be aware in here that if you see reversals like this, they can be swift and violent, okay?"
"782000","786380"," And a matter of fact, I posted on Twitter's more and said, good day nuts come to the market, but"
"786380","788020"," you know, you don't have to catch the entire move. "
"788400","793660"," If we're super fucking bullish here, and we're going to fucking scream higher, you don't need the"
"793660","794740"," entire fucking trade."
"795300","799680"," You literally only need the middle of it to catch a kick ass running that trade."
"800100","806040"," If you start to break above, if we start to break above here this morning, right, we've already"
"806040","807720"," broke one, right?"
"807900","811160"," And if we break the next one here, you break this one, right?"
"811300","814320"," And if you're able to break this one, you can then take that next trade. "
"815480","823040"," But in here, right here, I just want to warn you, hella fucking dangerous, hella fucking dangerous."
"824140","827400"," So do you buy spreads today with captain's trades?"
"828160","830140"," Here you probably possibly could."
"830460","834280"," If you put three months out of her, so you buy them, you could buy them three months out, and"
"834280","837580"," you would be able to weather a decline further decline into FOMC. "
"838400","844660"," That like a month and a half trade right here, right now, I think the risk versus reward is not"
"844660","847440"," as high as heading into FOMC."
"847920","852880"," I think the risk versus reward of the time that you've put on the trade with knowing that you're"
"852880","859800"," safer towards the fourth or sixth is probably a better trade, uh, having just that patience."
"860740","864560"," So if you want to take that trade today, you could throw three months out of it on your own. "
"864900","868580"," Personally, I'll probably wait for that trade into the fourth or sixth."
"870040","871880"," We move this over to the side over here."
"872300","875320"," We'll bring up the, sorry, my arm is all fucked up this morning. "
"879890","880770"," Give me a look here."
"881250","883530"," Buyers are in control right now in the market."
"883830","884230"," Good to see. "
"885330","887810"," Here indicator is slightly, slightly red."
"888310","892070"," A little bit of sellers above here and at four, four, two, one, fifty."
"892430","893850"," Clear skies above though. "
"894210","895890"," Clear skies above if we get above here."
"901710","903370"," Buyers in control right now."
"917370","918790"," Don't bring that back down. "
"930030","948520"," Some sellers above here at 42.50, 42.50, 42 "
"948520","959490",".50, they're"
"959490","962050"," even retreating a little bit right now at the moment, even higher."
"964310","984390"," Right here, 42.50. I'll"
"984390","985310"," put a price target here."
"1004290","1010770"," Put a price target here of 42.250. This is, this is where all of volatility is. "
"1011610","1018770"," We'll see if we can trade this higher from 42.04 up to this price target of 42.250 currently."
"1026329","1029750"," And we'll see the bears backing off even above from here as well."
"1029910","1031950"," This is a good sign for bulls currently. "
"1053020","1055280"," Keep your eyes on the right-hand side of the screen here."
"1055680","1056340"," Excuse me."
"1063650","1068350"," Keep your eyes on the right-hand side of the screen here and watch these buyers stepping in and"
"1068350","1070290"," where the resistance is above. "
"1075930","1082330"," We can also note the VIX just fell off a cliff following back down to previous support around 31 "
"1082330","1164520",".10. Also"
"1164520","1169460"," up is a concentration of call buyers on 425C expiring today."
"1170420","1172720"," So zero dates for today at 425C."
"1275280","1303700"," Some support down here at 4.19.50. It's"
"1303700","1304900"," a little bit of resistance still. "
"1305000","1312920"," This 42.20, 43.23.50. And then clear skies above."
"1317320","1319760"," We can start to see some of the sellers stepping in right now."
"1320140","1320620"," Good morning, everybody. "
"1320800","1321280"," How's everybody doing?"
"1327140","1330640"," Let me just say I have an attached chance to look at the live tab at this point."
"1377480","1382750"," Close to that 4.22.50. It doesn't mean we trade higher."
"1383010","1385990"," I don't squeeze higher, but just want you to see this point. "
"1386130","1388190"," You see this band of sellers up in here."
"1388970","1389350"," Okay."
"1389430","1396740"," Well, you see where they are above that band. "
"1397420","1405120"," If you break through, if you start to monetize here and then look for if we trade higher than 4 "
"1405120","1410480",".23, let's call it 4.23.11. So let me bring this up in a chart."
"1413040","1430130"," You're going to be looking for, let me drop a box or something, 4.23.11. So"
"1430130","1437840"," right in here, if you wanted to take a second long here, if you want to take a second long,"
"1438320","1441680"," you're going to be looking for, I think we were looking at four, let's look at this one more time."
"1443200","1446500"," Some support down here at, let me see if I can look here. "
"1463930","1476270"," 4.20, 4.19. So"
"1476270","1478390"," look for a dip by down somewhere in here."
"1479490","1483750"," But even if you do buy this dip here, the better trade is above here."
"1485550","1492350"," So continue this trade above this 4.23.11 or so. "
"1493230","1494570"," Surprise target area."
"1494830","1496330"," We just bounced off of it."
"1497550","1500590"," Look for your next trade, your next pickup down here. "
"1501250","1507370"," But the safer trade is above this 4.23. Because these are where the sellers are right now."
"1527410","1528830"," Buyers still loading up."
"1552740","1555360"," Still see that band of sellers above here. "
"1555960","1565140"," A mark on that is 4.21.97 now and 4.22.89. View up down below at 4.19 "
"1565140","1569620",".15. Small band of buyers lining up here."
"1570900","1571640"," Can see them right there."
"1589830","1591070"," How's everybody doing this morning?"
"1612370","1613850"," Let's see if we can catch a dip down here. "
"1614610","1615730"," We're looking for a dip."
"1619790","1622590"," Probably this is an A entry somewhere right down in here."
"1624770","1626590"," And this of course would be a B entry. "
"1629530","1634690"," If you're all super bearish here, next entry for you would be somewhere down below at that."
"1636690","1638030"," Actually, well, I don't know."
"1638150","1644970"," Yeah, I guess the close is somewhere around 4.17. And then 4.13. We'll look on book map and"
"1644970","1650070"," see where the first firm support is in case we do roll it over here. "
"1651030","1654390"," I don't think we are, but it looks like thanks for a long right now."
"1655990","1658310"," But if we do break down below here, we'll take a peek."
"1659390","1665230"," 4.16. 4.15. Yeah, 4.15 localized support. "
"1665810","1677400"," Then big buyers down below again, what was we said earlier, 4.10. My"
"1677400","1678880"," fucking arm is worse than yesterday."
"1679940","1682020"," My arm is all fucked up."
"1682640","1683520"," I have to go to the doctors. "
"1684600","1686760"," I was going to go today and then I'm just like, I don't know."
"1686940","1690340"," I mean, I know that these are all key pivot moments in the market for you guys right now."
"1690520","1692680"," So I want to be here for you. "
"1697290","1705610"," So I've got this S1 down here at S1 at 2.15. It's more than likely at 4.13, not"
"1705610","1712150"," at 4.15. Well, we'll keep an eye on 4.15 down here and see if this holds."
"1712310","1717610"," I'm going to assume that this 4.15 has more to do with bouncing off this trend line here."
"1717990","1723250"," So we'll just use this as a rolling key support for intraday trading. "
"1724110","1726810"," And then the buy the dippers are down here."
"1726990","1731950"," So buy the dippers are at 4.13 and buy the fucking dippers at 4.10. So if you got,"
"1732050","1734630"," you know, we'll rate it out there so we'll see it."
"1735670","1738550"," We'll just do buy the dip. "
"1741210","1743090"," Down here we'll do buy the fucking dip."
"1746320","1751340"," We'll go through the 440 and 450 call buyers this morning as well."
"1754950","1761050"," And then this will be a rolling trend line to bounce off of and some weak support down here around"
"1761050","1761290"," 420. "
"1808200","1810060"," Dip buyers stepping in once again."
"1821080","1822500"," See if they can maintain control."
"1822880","1824820"," We might have could have a trend day. "
"1825160","1826600"," I always like these trend days."
"1826740","1827920"," You guys know I like these trend days."
"1828120","1829800"," I'm getting you get the quick bounce. "
"1833990","1836890"," All right, roll down, consolidate, rip higher."
"1837250","1839870"," Another thing too is we tagged 4202."
"1840030","1843890"," So you'd be looking for at least another tag above before a reversal. "
"1843890","1847350"," If we get these, you'll see these will take place all day long."
"1847910","1849590"," You'll get some dip buyers stepping in."
"1850050","1854730"," What we'll do is we'll end up while the trade higher reject. "
"1855770","1860890"," Roll it over or you end up getting these beautiful days where we consolidate, move higher,"
"1860890","1864570"," consolidate, move higher, consolidate, and move higher."
"1871690","1877230"," HFTs currently are long and adding to, let me take a look here."
"1878630","1884650"," They're long and adding to 425 Cs for April 27 today's expiry. "
"1884870","1886470"," There's now 45,000 contracts."
"1886830","1888490"," There was like 35,000 earlier."
"1889170","1890930"," So they've got about 20% at this point. "
"1891190","1892250"," So we'll see if this holds up."
"1892730","1893570"," If we trade higher."
"1899030","1903310"," And we'll keep an eye on where rail resistance is in the market here. "
"1904150","1907050"," Looks like resistance has disappeared at the moment over here in the right."
"1907170","1910430"," You can see there's no sellers above to 423."
"1911290","1912870"," And even there, they're kind of light. "
"1916860","1919800"," These sellers have disappeared for some reason."
"1919920","1920840"," I don't know exactly why."
"1921840","1923100"," Let's see where they are again. "
"1924600","1926360"," 24, 22, 55."
"1927160","1928580"," It could be the start of some resistance."
"1976030","1977290"," Riding high right now. "
"1979800","1981160"," Riding high right now."
"1981400","1982140"," Another poke above."
"1992120","1993340"," There's a nice tag above again. "
"1993340","1994640"," That's your second tag."
"1995220","1996600"," That resistance, right?"
"1996800","1997500"," Swing down."
"1998560","2000140"," Check a second time. "
"2001080","2001640"," Right?"
"2001800","2006560"," Whenever you see these moves like this, if your day trader is right, one move, second move,"
"2006900","2007460"," reversal."
"2008180","2012080"," This is where bears want to step in that second, that second time, right?"
"2012560","2016080"," And try to send this lower and beat your stops out."
"2021920","2024140"," Where bears are going to try to be loading up right now. "
"2024180","2025880"," They want to reverse this thing down."
"2026620","2028900"," We'll find out if they're successful or not."
"2040470","2043830"," Bears want to commit and take it down to at least 413 down here. "
"2043890","2044730"," It's by the dip level."
"2045210","2048130"," This trend is important to maintain as a bull."
"2049110","2055790"," Your stops are some, or let's say bull stops are probably in here somewhere around 418, 11. "
"2056130","2058070"," So we'll take a look at that on the chart right now."
"2064440","2068960"," And you can see them right here."
"2069159","2077659"," This is where stops are for bulls between 418 51 and the low would be for 1686. "
"2077659","2078659"," Pretty low, actually."
"2079480","2081860"," It's a lot of by the dippers down here today."
"2093590","2094510"," Nasty reversal. "
"2099620","2102020"," No, my fucking arm."
"2115210","2118350"," Here indicator turning a little bit more a little bit more red right now."
"2122610","2125150"," Take a look at the spot gamma report as we reverse right here. "
"2125210","2126510"," You know, you've got some levels here, right?"
"2126630","2128550"," You know, you got a level here at 419 41."
"2130710","2133030"," You got by the dippers all the way down here."
"2133170","2136070"," So this is actually quite decent depth down here to buy the dip. "
"2136270","2140750"," You're talking 421 or 428 and then buyers stepping in all the way down to 470."
"2141150","2145090"," It's pretty good base for for bulls this morning to be trying to catch a dip."
"2150130","2150970"," We'll bring this over. "
"2151090","2153410"," Well, that didn't bring up the spot gamma report past couple days."
"2154670","2159910"," I was a little pissed off at them, but they did a good job."
"2160110","2166230"," They yesterday before they they had fucked up, but you know, they gave their best call and they"
"2166230","2167530"," actually took ownership of that call. "
"2167530","2172290"," So I was extremely happy with them yesterday because you want to see the people that you trust and"
"2172290","2177690"," the people that you look up to take take responsibility when you make a bad call or, you know, your"
"2177690","2179350"," call isn't exactly what you say it was going to be."
"2180170","2183890"," And I always liked sometimes fuck them or we'll make a definitive call on something."
"2183970","2187750"," And other times they'd leave themselves a small out and they'd be like, look, I told you a small"
"2187750","2188270"," out or whatever. "
"2188270","2189890"," And, you know, you paint a lot of money for that shit."
"2190370","2191290"," Shit ain't cheap, right?"
"2191450","2194390"," Those guys can charge up to fucking hundreds of dollars every month."
"2194830","2197690"," So if you're going to be charged with somebody fucking four or five hundred bucks a month,"
"2197750","2198750"," depending on what you're getting from them. "
"2199190","2199370"," Nice."
"2199370","2203230"," I spend, uh, I spend a fucking couple hundred bucks between the heroin decay and all other bulls"
"2203230","2205450"," did probably spend like two, three hundred bucks a month."
"2205770","2209050"," So I'm going to spend, if I'm going to spend that kind of fucking money, I'm expecting, Hey, we"
"2209050","2211930"," fucked up or we got a wrong or this is why we got a wrong or whatever. "
"2212190","2213090"," So you did a good job yesterday."
"2213090","2215350"," Of course, we'll, we'll bring their report up again this morning."
"2216690","2218070"," So let's just take a look right here. "
"2218090","2220870"," We know that the bulls have to maintain down here at four eighteen."
"2221570","2226710"," The one thing I will say for bulls this morning is they've got some depth to buy the dip down"
"2226710","2226950"," here."
"2227630","2230990"," We'll, we'll bring this back up real quick and just, and just show it. "
"2234480","2239580"," You can see that depth of book of buying goes all the way down to four sixteen sixty four."
"2240960","2247910"," So these, these by the dippers down here, it's literally right where we are right now."
"2250470","2252190"," Right here, they're trying to buy this dip. "
"2256340","2258140"," So they're right down here, right down."
"2258340","2260260"," So we don't want to see this break up here a bull."
"2260520","2261700"," You don't want to be selling either. "
"2261760","2266500"," This is where, this is where the bears want you to stop out, right?"
"2266680","2270360"," They want your, they want to hit your stops down in here so that you sell, right?"
"2270480","2273980"," So what they want to do is the bears want to send this shit down and break."
"2274660","2277860"," Because once they break here, you're going to sell and it's going to get nasty."
"2278700","2284100"," Now, so you want to maintain this, this dip buying over here in this vicinity so you can continue"
"2284100","2285040"," this trade higher. "
"2292290","2293550"," Damn, getting good this morning."
"2294010","2294610"," I'm all spicy."
"2299310","2304410"," I'm putting all kinds of like, rectangles and shit and fucking squares in the trade this morning. "
"2305770","2308190"," It's trying to visualize this stuff for you guys."
"2308850","2310050"," See it's swoop up, right?"
"2310310","2311130"," Second test above."
"2312010","2314430"," You got the bulls in charge, right?"
"2314930","2319650"," Swing up one more time just to check and then starts to reverse back down to find out if the"
"2319650","2325270"," bulls are actually going to buy this shit down here or not and commit to going fucking long. "
"2327090","2329210"," Fucking bulls look like fucking starved."
"2330110","2332150"," Jesus Christ by a goddamn dip."
"2332810","2342740"," A little"
"2342740","2345460"," battle zone down here on real. "
"2345840","2351440"," So we'll go through the, we'll go through the, we'll go through the the spot cam report this"
"2351440","2351680"," morning."
"2352660","2359240"," So they've been talking about this 4,000 for the past few fucking days or whatever."
"2359460","2360800"," We'll chat about this morning. "
"2362060","2366900"," The macro theme is that a sustained rally is unlikely to occur until May 4th, okay?"
"2368020","2372480"," Now this, they've been emphasized in this past few days, but they have changed their tone slightly"
"2372480","2376200"," this morning, which holds FOMC in the Russia default."
"2377620","2380780"," Okay, we've talked about the Russian default, right?"
"2381160","2384220"," We'll do these events, volatility, how large puts is unlikely to be being sold."
"2385240","2392800"," Their point behind this right here is that, is that, you know, I think I posted about this was"
"2392800","2400160"," like, you know, a bank could be fucking long Tesla or fucking spy or Clorox or something in XLP,"
"2400160","2400500"," right?"
"2401480","2402900"," And they're long like the market. "
"2403180","2405060"," They have to buy their long only hedge funds."
"2405060","2406060"," They're family offices."
"2406260","2409220"," There's always people that are long from a much lower level, right?"
"2409640","2410860"," I can show you sometime in flow. "
"2411000","2411240"," I'll go."
"2412080","2416780"," There's a way to look at the nodes, right, in the market."
"2416960","2418660"," I'll probably bring that up for a slow today at some point. "
"2418940","2424540"," I'll bring it up for you, but it actually shows their equity block and dark pool prints actually"
"2424540","2428680"," shows where banks are long, shows where the majority of them are long."
"2428960","2435180"," So how deep can they go before they start to sell the market and in that same vein, let's say"
"2435180","2440300"," of a bank that's long for five billion dollars at four thousand, right?"
"2441020","2445860"," Now, as we trade down to that level, they're going to put put protection on for the long like they"
"2445860","2447000"," actually own the underlying."
"2448260","2452940"," They're going to put this put protection on not remove it in case there is a black swan event. "
"2453100","2457180"," You think got a guy in an office in the basement that's like, you have to put this protection on,"
"2457180","2457900"," right?"
"2458060","2462020"," And if we trigger, we'll hold on to the to the puts and we'll start to sell our position."
"2462020","2466440"," And those nodes run down the chart going back years."
"2466640","2469900"," And we'll look at that later at some point this morning, but that's the point, right?"
"2470140","2471940"," Due to these events, they're not going to sell them. "
"2472160","2476380"," And they'll continue to add them if they need to as we break lower, right?"
"2476540","2482360"," They'll even let them expire worthless to maintain these huge positions they have in the market."
"2482820","2484000"," So that's the key point, right?"
"2484180","2487400"," That kind of pins us down around four thousand to some extent."
"2487860","2489520"," It doesn't mean that we're going to sell down a 360. "
"2490260","2494080"," You need to see more hedging and more put buying as we break those levels."
"2495120","2499040"," But we see substantial longer term support at four zero five zero."
"2499280","2500880"," They're kind of taking the middle of the road, right?"
"2501020","2506420"," They're not telling you forty one hundred, not telling you four thousand or three ninety nine zero. "
"2506440","2508860"," They're just saying four zero five zero, right?"
"2509260","2512020"," It's like a fucking magnet right now, right?"
"2512220","2517240"," So anytime the bull step away, anytime you see like bull say, oh, we're not going up any longer,"
"2517500","2520400"," we're going to magnet to four forty, four fifty, forty fifty."
"2520840","2523840"," We're not going to magnet to forty four five zero."
"2524460","2527440"," If the puts go away right now, well, that's just different regime. "
"2527700","2532860"," But if the bulls lose their confidence at any point, the magnet is four zero five zero."
"2533040","2533680"," We've seen that."
"2534700","2537000"," We've seen that magnet present itself. "
"2541390","2545350"," We've seen that magnet present itself this entire fucking month, right?"
"2546030","2551330"," I mean, nothing for fucking nothing, but the first fucking sign of fucking panic from a fucking"
"2551330","2552510"," bull, right?"
"2552690","2553230"," Come to the channel."
"2553430","2554290"," We fucking sell it."
"2554390","2554870"," Come to the channel. "
"2554950","2555510"," We sell it."
"2555910","2556490"," Sell it."
"2556770","2557950"," We break out of the channel. "
"2558930","2563010"," And I say to you, hey, you need to take some some some bull risk here, right?"
"2563250","2567650"," Tail risk that we could trade higher because because this look because we're above the ball trigger"
"2567650","2572790"," and you're going to buy two set fucking calls here just in case we trade higher, right?"
"2573790","2581010"," Same thing down below here, but with the caveat that we keep selling off because they keep adding"
"2581010","2582950"," these protective puts, right?"
"2583650","2589530"," And whenever the bulls lose their steam here, we tend to gravitate lower to that four zero five"
"2589530","2589890"," zero."
"2590410","2597150"," With that said, we shouldn't roll lower than four thousand unless they continue to add huge hedges"
"2597150","2599090"," below that number, right?"
"2599910","2604910"," Four four zero, excuse me, forty eight hundred forty six hundred whatever."
"2605410","2609290"," We'll just gravitate towards this until those puts start to roll off. "
"2609630","2615670"," And the only fucked up thing about this is that they wound up this week buying more puts at four"
"2615670","2619930"," thousand farther dated out into the into May."
"2622190","2628050"," So even if we don't get down below here, they're trying to pin into FOMC is the point that they're"
"2628050","2629150"," not trying to pin."
"2629310","2630210"," They are pinning. "
"2630570","2633190"," The pinning action is by them trying to protect themselves."
"2633570","2633870"," Not anything."
"2635190","2638510"," It's not anything they're doing that's like, oh, we're trying to dump the market. "
"2638830","2641010"," It's we're trying to protect ourselves down here, okay?"
"2641650","2645850"," Or do we're trying to protect ourselves by buying these puts, but in turn, it pins us down here"
"2645850","2652230"," until these um volatile events subside or pass us by."
"2653090","2658570"," In that case, if if we didn't lose that volatility in these events, if they say something nasty,"
"2658990","2661470"," they're very well hedged, right?"
"2661850","2667070"," Because they're they've already bought these and you would then be the one to buy four thousands or"
"2667070","2670390"," thirty six and thirty eights and they would print their puts down here."
"2670570","2672410"," Does that make sense to you, right?"
"2672750","2679370"," They might even create fake news heading into FOMC and tell you the market's going to crash so that"
"2679370","2682070"," they will that so that you will print their puts down here. "
"2682070","2684590"," You'll buy thinking we're going down lower."
"2684590","2690430"," In turn, they've been accumulating higher calls that they're going to monotize."
"2690510","2692430"," So you'll see this big swing higher. "
"2693290","2699490"," Meanwhile, you'd be fucking loaded to the tips at the last minute for 360s, 380s, 390s and we'll"
"2699490","2701650"," actually swing this higher because they have more money than you."
"2707120","2711000"," The daily note for today, futures are trading at 4190 up for moment eight loads of 4135."
"2711400","2713040"," Our volatility estimate remains in line with yesterday. "
"2713640","2719680"," 1.2 percent open to close for S&P 500 resistance is at 420, right?"
"2719800","2724060"," On the spy, followed by 4250, we saw that resistance at 4250 this morning."
"2724700","2726200"," Support lies at 4100."
"2726920","2727900"," That's 410, right?"
"2728440","2733590"," That's low, right?"
"2733990","2737530"," They want to set your your stops down here. "
"2737870","2739750"," They want to break you down in here, right?"
"2739870","2741610"," This is the last bit of support in here."
"2741970","2748470"," They want to trigger your cells and they want to take it down to 410, which is right down in"
"2748470","2749030"," here, okay?"
"2749630","2750830"," So they want to trigger your cells."
"2750990","2754010"," They want to break this, break this trend line, right?"
"2754110","2755010"," They want you to be down. "
"2755110","2756630"," I'm sure there's someone in my chat, right?"
"2756770","2757290"," I have even looked."
"2757790","2761190"," I'm sure there's someone in my chat saying, I wish I sold my fucking calls."
"2761590","2767790"," Trust me, this action right here is intended to break you to sell your calls so they can trade this"
"2767790","2768390"," down to 410. "
"2769090","2773630"," Now, just be aware down here that we've got two targets, 413 and 410."
"2780620","2786200"," Well, 420 support put up a solid fight yesterday, it filled into the close, right?"
"2786400","2787260"," We had a bearish close."
"2787720","2789540"," This was spurred on by major weakness in tech. "
"2789780","2797200"," This was headlined by a minus 11% decline in Tesla, but heavy selling across the board, individual"
"2797200","2798360"," tickers, heavy selling."
"2798820","2802260"," As many of you as well, we're the top member weightings in the S&P 500 tech."
"2802880","2807980"," We're talking about this earlier in the week saying that maybe they're just waiting for all these"
"2807980","2812960"," big tech companies, bigger, big waiters to report and then they sell afterwards, right?"
"2814220","2818160"," The big takeaway from an options perspective is the roll down continues. "
"2818920","2821340"," A signal that options shares are accepting these lower prices."
"2821780","2823780"," You're comfortable down here, if you're a bull, right?"
"2824860","2831100"," Yesterday, we discussed the map where in the key level was originally 4400 and that level shifted"
"2831100","2832560"," down to 4300."
"2832840","2842750"," Today, it appears that flow filled in on the call input side at 420 spine to a lesser extent, 4200. "
"2843290","2846690"," The market is stair stepping lower and the options flow is going with it."
"2847090","2854370"," It is of note that we are starting to see some chunkier call positions being added in the 4400 and"
"2854370","2855790"," 4400 area."
"2857670","2860510"," We'll explain what this means in just a moment here, okay?"
"2860970","2867270"," You can start to see the calls lining up in outweighing the puts down below here, right?"
"2867730","2869850"," The shift to higher calls strikes. "
"2870770","2872890"," Overall, this price action is in line with our expectations."
"2873190","2876050"," We are still focused on 5.4 as a key date."
"2876730","2879470"," I think it actually continues to 5.6, believe it or not. "
"2879990","2886570"," We continue to view the 4,000 to 4550 areas, major options induced support and it is possible we"
"2886570","2891710"," see the market compress into this level as we approach 5.4. A snapback short cover rally could"
"2891710","2898870"," happen rather quickly into 4300 but below 4200 were subject to the reflex of feedback loop of"
"2898870","2902310"," dealer's shorting which leads to lower prices and more dealer shorting."
"2903470","2906770"," We think that the lower mark though, the lower the mark goes into 5.4, the better the odds of"
"2906770","2907830"," a snapback relief rally."
"2908430","2912850"," Applied IV goes higher, traders need increasing the larger moves to justify payoffs. "
"2913030","2918530"," Unless we get a major Russian default and uber hawkish fed, there could be a nice bounce higher"
"2918530","2920250"," driven simply by extreme sentiment."
"2920570","2925090"," Lasted together with last pair of standing, we put together a video analyzing Elon Musk's Twitter"
"2925090","2929570"," loan details and its potential on the impact of the stock."
"2929810","2930990"," It is rather an interesting situation. "
"2931430","2939810"," Now, this wasn't in the report from this morning when I posted about Tesla and their margin call"
"2939810","2940110"," stuff."
"2940390","2947470"," Now, I read that yesterday in a Benzinga Pro I think was"
"2947470","2956870"," the first place Spock Emmett did some peace on it this morning."
"2957030","2962190"," I think I don't know if this came out yesterday or not but yesterday Benzinga Pro was talking about"
"2962190","2969390"," the implications of entities trying to short the fucking stock down to almost like a different kind"
"2969390","2971970"," of poison pill from people that don't like him out there. "
"2972650","2974810"," Just be aware of that this morning as well."
"2975870","2984330"," Okay, now this is what I'm talking about 44500."
"2984710","2986010"," Now, this could be banks, right?"
"2986530","2992270"," They're downward down here near 4050 so they got a guy at the prop desk going, hey, start adding in"
"2992270","2994850"," some calls above with longer dates on them. "
"2996050","3006280"," So, when I was talking to you, when I was talking to you about early January back here and"
"3006280","3008920"," I was saying that you could get torn up in here, right?"
"3009420","3015340"," There's one other risk in this a little bit slightly different than this than this action back in"
"3015340","3015520"," here."
"3016080","3018520"," Let's get rid of this still on here."
"3025740","3030980"," A little instead of this being the low but getting really fucked up in here, right?"
"3031640","3035740"," Let's say you bought this the key is this that let's say you bought this for 2076. "
"3036520","3044300"," I'm telling you, people panic sold in here long people panic sold in here short, right?"
"3044300","3045660"," Didn't matter if you're a bull or a bear."
"3045840","3046900"," There's lots of panic in here."
"3047300","3052260"," Now, this area here, we could have something similar to this take place between now and the fourth. "
"3053120","3054880"," This sideways and down action."
"3055400","3061300"," The only key difference in this action that I would note would be that rather than having these"
"3061300","3066440"," higher lows leading into the fifth or the fourth of the sixth, you might see something slightly"
"3066440","3071340"," different where we actually look like we're going lower like a slow drag down."
"3072660","3077840"," Maybe even one more capitulation move and you're going to think we're falling off when in reality,"
"3078400","3081360"," we're going to make this fucking huge rally higher in May. "
"3082560","3089220"," Just be conscious of this as we trade into this time period."
"3089740","3096120"," Of note in here as well is you're seeing more call buying at 444500."
"3096360","3102740"," That doesn't mean we go to that to 4500, but we can probably get to 4300 and possibly 4400 or"
"3102740","3103760"," more buyers step in. "
"3103940","3109680"," Now, with that said, if you are going to add down here, I mentioned this yesterday, day before, and"
"3109680","3114320"," this is back in January, but if you're going to add, start adding, if you're going to do like that"
"3114320","3121740"," captain's trades trade early, you on your own can go out there and get yourself like in the money"
"3121740","3129300"," call or something with three months on it, rather than just a month and a half to account for a"
"3129300","3131140"," slide down or even a move down."
"3131200","3134440"," We're going to look at that right now too and why I'm explaining that why I said to you put"
"3134440","3139780"," three months instead of just one and a half months or whatever on it."
"3140260","3146560"," That's because there are people out there saying that our put call ratios are fucking like five"
"3146560","3152600"," day, 10 day MA put call ratios are fucking going back to 2 March or 2020. "
"3154000","3155460"," That's where this fall is right here."
"3156500","3160200"," The point that I was making behind that was if even if you were to buy those, let's say you"
"3160200","3165080"," buy those those spreads here, you have to put enough time on them for them not to cancel market"
"3165080","3166840"," makers and dealers, right?"
"3167080","3171220"," We'll we'll look back in time on people buying, let's say a call spread here."
"3171580","3173220"," They'll look back on this believe it or not. "
"3173320","3174900"," They they're smart motherfuckers, right?"
"3175480","3179540"," They'll go out there and let's say you buy a call spread back here, right?"
"3180740","3183320"," What they'll do is they won't fucking print."
"3184840","3193240"," We'll have to delete this shit in a minute, but then you'll see right here even even even the"
"3193240","3197040"," comeback that we had into May didn't print them, right?"
"3197560","3201440"," And then into into late May didn't print them, but not until right?"
"3201780","3206080"," Like three months later, did they fucking actually start to print anyone that was caught in this"
"3206080","3206920"," trap back here?"
"3207440","3212720"," Okay, so so I'm not saying we're gonna roll down here into May or anything like that, but I'm"
"3212720","3217760"," saying if you're gonna buy down here, this is like the riskiest time for you to be throwing on a"
"3217760","3219140"," sure thing, right?"
"3219660","3221600"," We could get that snapback higher in here."
"3221680","3224000"," We might not, we might just roll it over and down. "
"3224440","3230360"," So if you're gonna take that, you know, captain's trades trade, the key point is that you should"
"3230360","3234380"," put some fucking time on them to beat out these market makers that will try to fuck you."
"3234640","3236620"," Believe it or not, they will try to fuck you."
"3236920","3241720"," They build this shit into what they do and people always like when we come back to that level after"
"3241720","3246660"," the fucking call spreads that fucking every goddamn sorry, every bank loaded up on. "
"3246920","3250560"," That's when they'll fucking let them print after they all expire fucking worthless."
"3250940","3256040"," Winky talks about this all the time when everybody's in on a specific grade, all the time he talks"
"3256040","3256560"," about this."
"3257100","3259560"," And you can see great examples of it in previous history. "
"3261820","3274680"," Let me go back over here, get down inside of here and see what's going on with that,"
"3274760","3277120"," how trying to trigger your fucking stop losses down here."
"3280580","3281060"," How good."
"3284700","3287960"," Fucking gangster bears, evil fucking bears. "
"3291180","3292480"," Hopefully I kept it busy."
"3296860","3298860"," So with that being said, right?"
"3299120","3301980"," With all that being said, you you read that report this morning."
"3302160","3303160"," It's not that we can't go up here. "
"3303180","3305320"," It's not that we can't have a great fucking day of rallies."
"3305520","3306900"," Some can't trade higher."
"3307540","3314100"," The key point though in here is that whenever whenever though the will of the bulls comes off or"
"3314100","3315680"," more puts flow comes in. "
"3316500","3318100"," Is it good by the dip, by the way?"
"3318880","3326000"," The point being is that whenever the bulls lose their will in this area, we're going to revert back"
"3326000","3326620"," lower, okay?"
"3327280","3328260"," Your support is now."
"3328360","3330260"," You can even just look by that report, right?"
"3332650","3333930"," Our support was here, right?"
"3334730","3336030"," Our support was here, right?"
"3336630","3338150"," So our support is lower."
"3338570","3348490"," You know, we can trade higher, but our fucking support is down here at is four zero"
"3348490","3351150"," five down here, right?"
"3351330","3352970"," And then and then four thousand down below. "
"3353370","3355150"," We'll stair step this shit down."
"3355850","3361670"," Even if we trade sideways, you know, into into FMC or nearby FMC."
"3362070","3366450"," So when we're in this fucking mess down here, if you'd bought some call spreads back here, back"
"3366450","3372630"," here yesterday, day before whatever day it was Monday was yesterday, I wouldn't lose if you timed"
"3372630","3375330"," it wrong, if you did it for like a month or month and a half, it might print. "
"3376010","3377630"," But but there's risk they won't."
"3378870","3382910"," There's risk they'll try to fuck you between now in the fourth."
"3383570","3386730"," And then if there weren't dated far enough out that they're not going to print for you, you're"
"3386730","3389630"," going to get pissed off, right?"
"3389730","3390770"," You're going to get you're going to get pissed off. "
"3390910","3392930"," The market maker is going to fuck in the back end of this trade."
"3393690","3397350"," So what I would say is on a on a high ripper, if you get a day of ripper in"
"3397350","3402190"," the next five days, take them for 10%, 20% get back out of them and try to reset heading"
"3402190","3403150"," into the fourth or fifth."
"3403870","3405330"," I haven't made this trade yet. "
"3405890","3411230"," And I don't intend to either because I'm looking at it from the perspective of if I missed the"
"3411230","3412990"," beginning of this trade, I can always take it higher."
"3413510","3418390"," If we do trade lower, the risk and volatility go away as we head towards that meeting."
"3418770","3425430"," So as we head towards May 4th, you know, it's the it's the pragmatic approach to taking this trade,"
"3425530","3425710"," right?"
"3425870","3426430"," This long trade. "
"3427150","3433110"," So combining all these things with market capitulation, combining the shit pile of stuff, they keep"
"3433110","3434090"," telling to you out there."
"3434690","3439970"," You can day trade this all day long, but take that that one trade every month and a half, two"
"3439970","3442550"," months, three months, you're looking for that moment, right?"
"3443070","3446590"," You're looking for that moment of capitulation, and we still haven't seen it yet."
"3448030","3452150"," Now, do we get down a four or five probably or close to it?"
"3454190","3458710"," Probably, even if it's the sideways trade, you can even look back here. "
"3458950","3463390"," If you look back on that January time frame, there was at least like two or three moments where you"
"3463390","3465190"," had a chance to grab those bottoms."
"3466350","3467290"," We did it yesterday."
"3467290","3468130"," It went down to 413. "
"3468910","3471530"," There's nothing saying we can't do it again and at least hit 410."
"3475530","3476470"," Hold on a second here."
"3479150","3481090"," All right, so that's my morning fucking rant. "
"3482390","3484430"," Dip buyers down here below at 415."
"3487690","3488250"," 410."
"3490290","3491350"," Reasonable support. "
"3495390","3497010"," It's going to a larger time frame."
"3507430","3510230"," 4,000 expect a reaction down at 4,400."
"3511750","3512610"," However you call it. "
"3513510","3515030"," Middle of the road is 405."
"3515170","3515630"," 410."
"3516470","3520070"," I think Winky was asking some questions this morning about like, is it arbitrary?"
"3521390","3521710"," It's not. "
"3521710","3523390"," Well, we'll look at why it's not arbitrary."
"3523950","3526790"," And there's a simple way without even looking up the complicated system."
"3527650","3530370"," Complicated ways to find out where these levels are. "
"3530990","3533350"," One of the easiest places is on flow."
"3533490","3534450"," I'll go believe it or not."
"3534770","3537770"," But there are easier ways for you as a trader to figure that stuff out. "
"3538290","3539710"," That's a good question to be asking."
"3541810","3542490"," Hold on here."
"3544650","3549230"," So if you're looking over the course of a year, you can look, it's probably a shitty place to look. "
"3549450","3553730"," But if you're looking over the course of a year, you're going to look for areas that we spend a"
"3553730","3554370"," lot of time in."
"3555450","3558750"," When we spend, these are important places in the market."
"3558770","3564510"," When you spend a lot of time in them, when you hear people say, well, we gapped up here. "
"3565190","3566550"," We need to fill that gap down there."
"3566610","3568210"," It's because we didn't spend a lot of time in these areas."
"3568950","3570890"," These areas here, we spend time here. "
"3571130","3571750"," They are important."
"3572010","3574910"," Some are more important than others, but you'll see us and then we'll take that leg up."
"3575910","3576090"," Okay. "
"3576470","3580990"," And you want to see this 380 down there, 360, another important area down here."
"3581350","3583810"," These are all important areas that we spend time at."
"3584090","3591730"," Another cool place you can see shit like this is on, even better, would be on stocks like AMD,"
"3592370","3594470"," Amazon, over a longer period of time. "
"3595010","3601180"," Like if you look at AMD over a longer period of time, look at them like a five year, right?"
"3601340","3604880"," You can see MD selling off, but you can actually see these key levels in here, right?"
"3605320","3607200"," Here's a key level that you spend time at."
"3607520","3610060"," Here's another key level that you spend time at, right?"
"3610740","3612800"," And then here's a smaller level, right?"
"3613000","3614460"," Pushed up and then coming back down."
"3614500","3618820"," We're actually coming into a key level right now on AMD, right?"
"3618980","3621640"," Spent a lot of time down in here on AMD. "
"3622040","3623300"," So be aware of that, right?"
"3623660","3628820"," You're going to have trouble getting through areas like this when you've spent this much time down"
"3628820","3629140"," in here."
"3629380","3634200"," There are people that are long term holders down in this area on AMD, right?"
"3634560","3635680"," They went long here."
"3636020","3641300"," They've been long all the way up to 164, about 0.46, and they haven't cut themselves loose. "
"3641720","3645840"," So what is, what is a, like a bank to do down in here, right?"
"3646220","3649460"," They start to put some protection on to protect decline here."
"3650500","3656060"," And if they start to decline, they could pull the rip cord on their lungs here and be protected if"
"3656060","3658360"," there's further, further decline below."
"3658900","3661280"," But I want you to be aware of these, of these zones down. "
"3661360","3667720"," This is why when we're down near 4000, you're going to expect to have a reaction, right?"
"3668220","3674000"," People that are long have been long going back to, for some time, in some of these heavy hitters."
"3674080","3677840"," I mean, these are, these are companies that a bank takes risk on and says, am I going to buy"
"3677840","3678440"," fucking hood?"
"3678920","3680400"," We're going to talk about that later today too."
"3680600","3685880"," I'm going to buy fucking Robinhood with some fucking goofball CEO and Pat Park, my fucking billions"
"3685880","3689160"," in that company, where I'm going to fucking park it in AMD, right?"
"3689340","3692300"," They're going to park it in fucking AMD for Clorox or whatever. "
"3692920","3696560"," Okay, so these are some key levels for the market in general."
"3697380","3699880"," You will expect buyers here."
"3700340","3705180"," You're not, you're, these buyers down here, these, these motherfuckers are well hedged, right?"
"3705340","3709340"," With puts and they're fucking long the market down here in some of these companies. "
"3709960","3711520"," So you should expect a reaction."
"3711800","3717400"," You should expect them to want to buy this here and be protected while doing it and having a place"
"3717400","3720060"," where they will pull the plug lower, right?"
"3720220","3723360"," They'll pull the plug on their lungs so they don't lose any money down here."
"3723720","3724800"," Just be conscious of that. "
"3725040","3729380"," Now, let's talk about fucking Robinhood from pissed off right now is going to start this whole"
"3729380","3739320"," thing using Robinhood and start this whole trade using fucking Robinhood because I know a lot of"
"3739320","3745260"," you traders are trading using that fucking app, which is a dumpster fire."
"3745680","3749400"," My original plan was to make these trades on Robinhood with you."
"3751400","3752400"," And that's still there. "
"3752500","3755440"," I still have the money sitting in Robinhood to trade this here with you guys."
"3756920","3757820"," Take this trade."
"3758000","3761660"," I don't know if you have enough time before taking this trade. "
"3762220","3763760"," They have an ER coming up, I think, right?"
"3764320","3764560"," Thursday."
"3767100","3768400"," You know, I don't like Gerber."
"3768500","3773680"," I don't like Ross Gerber a ton, but him just making the statement this morning saying get your"
"3773680","3774760"," money out of Robinhood. "
"3775860","3780280"," You don't hear that too often from people with influence out there in the market."
"3780980","3783900"," And they laid off 9% of their fucking staff."
"3784420","3787340"," It's ripe for being taken over, right?"
"3787540","3788920"," Being bought by someone else. "
"3789020","3789900"," It's ripe for a takeover."
"3789900","3791780"," I don't know that it goes to zero."
"3792000","3794860"," I think, though, it's ripe for some company. "
"3795100","3797520"," I wouldn't fucking surprise you if Ross Gerber tried to buy it."
"3798640","3805100"," But the key being is if we start making these trades in Robinhood, we could get fucked over in our"
"3805100","3805380"," trades."
"3805760","3808100"," If you own stock in Robinhood, it's not so bad. "
"3808920","3811580"," If you have 500,000 or less, you're fine."
"3812660","3816660"," If the trades you start making money on trades, we get fucked in options."
"3816800","3821500"," When this happens to companies, you can get some serious trouble. "
"3821760","3827500"," So if you are using Robinhood out there, maybe we step it up to Webull."
"3827720","3831580"," I don't know if Webull now supports that stuff or not."
"3831580","3832760"," We could start with that. "
"3832980","3837460"," It's the next logical step for a new trader is to move over to Webull."
"3837640","3841140"," And then we move you to like Tasty or some other trading platform."
"3841720","3845420"," So if you're a new trader out there and you're following right now, if you're long in anything, if"
"3845420","3848260"," you're long in stocks up to $500,000, you're safe. "
"3848920","3855720"," Now, even in that safety, I remember back when when Tesla, oh no, not Tesla."
"3855920","3859700"," I remember back when GME was going through its rip, its rip phase, right?"
"3860820","3864540"," I was trading GME back from like 15, 20 bucks, that kind of nonsense."
"3865120","3867480"," I was in the original group of traders in GME, right?"
"3868120","3873500"," But I remember there's a second group of traders that jumped in on it and they got fucked in"
"3873500","3877900"," Robinhood and they were moving their money out of Robinhood to other platforms. "
"3878660","3884480"," And when they were doing that, it took days to weeks for some people to get their money to be"
"3884480","3884780"," moved."
"3884780","3886400"," It wasn't like a fast process."
"3886960","3891560"," And if this company folds or it's bought by somebody else, that process could take, I mean, people"
"3891560","3892600"," are going to tell you time frames. "
"3892600","3894500"," I saw some people that had three days."
"3895320","3896780"," Other people were like weeks."
"3897640","3899900"," So I'll just be conscious of that. "
"3900080","3901160"," There's like two parts of this, right?"
"3901260","3905360"," If you're in some calls or puts or spreads, you can get fucked in something like that happen."
"3905620","3909700"," If you own stock in it, you could get, you know, nut bag holding, but you could see the market"
"3909700","3914460"," fucking rocket up 30% and meanwhile, you're holding your dick out there not being able to trade"
"3914460","3914680"," that."
"3914720","3916220"," You're going to get pissed about shit like that. "
"3916740","3920820"," So we're probably going to have to have a conversation at some point today or after hours or"
"3920820","3924240"," something where we pick a different platform to start on."
"3924380","3928620"," My hope was to roll you into a different part to teach you how to make these trades on Robinhood"
"3928620","3929780"," and then roll it over."
"3929980","3932460"," Now, I know Robinhood has a lot of value to it. "
"3932640","3933700"," I don't think it's going bankrupt."
"3933880","3935220"," Do some of you guys do think they are?"
"3935560","3936700"," I don't think that they are."
"3936780","3939700"," I think that there is a lot of value in Robinhood. "
"3939900","3941860"," I don't care what they've added and all that kind of shit."
"3941900","3946800"," It literally, if they had a little bit more fucking transparency, a new CEO, and they threw up some"
"3946800","3949400"," decent fucking charting decent, right?"
"3949600","3950280"," It'd be game over."
"3950400","3951540"," They would fucking rule the world. "
"3952000","3959480"," That's the fucking it's not that hard to turn Robinhood around and fucking kids love it."
"3959760","3963700"," You guys got to give some respect out there to young traders and young new investors."
"3964520","3967160"," Well, not respect, but you got to give them. "
"3967560","3968900"," You got to give them the idea."
"3969300","3972300"," You guys have to remember when you were the first time you bought a stock."
"3972660","3974100"," First time you sold a stock. "
"3974680","3975900"," First time you held a stock."
"3976120","3981740"," First time you traded an option like you guys for a lot of long time guys out there fucking forget"
"3981740","3983200"," what it's like."
"3983940","3991100"," The first six months to like years, three years at the level of what these new investors and"
"3991100","3991540"," traders are. "
"3991800","3995200"," I am one of the people that believe in the retail trading class."
"3995720","4002160"," I believe that if we work hard towards trading new traders and I believe for a hundred fucking"
"4002160","4008360"," percent that if retail can get their asses together someday, you will be able to fight back against"
"4008360","4012180"," the fucking pure unadulterated fuck show that are the banks."
"4012700","4015880"," You'll you'll be a power to fuck with that that they're gonna try to fuck with. "
"4015960","4017000"," Well, they're trying to fuck with you now."
"4017540","4024600"," They've learned your ways since DME, but there's a way and time as time passes for the retail power"
"4024600","4026780"," retail to be a powerful force in the market."
"4026980","4033900"," If they can ever stop fucking fighting with each other and lend a good argument to each other, try"
"4033900","4035580"," to teach each other and try to band together. "
"4036240","4040820"," They do have a now with all that bullshit said and all that rant and shit off topic."
"4042140","4047880"," I promise you, there are banks out there with it with love love to get their hands on fucking the"
"4047880","4052960"," Robinhood platform and love to add in just some basic shit like we're not gonna fuck you over."
"4053420","4055520"," I think there's some fucked up rules too. "
"4055660","4057940"," Like they don't let you like they auto close."
"4058320","4062160"," I was reading some shit this past week like they auto closed zero dates on you."
"4062660","4065360"," You can't close them after a certain time really fucked up shit. "
"4065500","4070420"," Someone was commenting saying like if you're holding like if you're holding trades into like three"
"4070420","4075980"," forty five or three thirty or something that weird shit they won't let you like sell them after"
"4075980","4077420"," that time frame or something."
"4078100","4082860"," So then the market knows this until they'll like dump it into a certain time frame then they'll rip"
"4082860","4083240"," it higher."
"4083700","4085900"," So you get butt fucked fucking twice today. "
"4086520","4086980"," I don't know."
"4087140","4088820"," I don't know if that is whatever this but whatever."
"4088820","4098520"," So my point is that if you are only a trader on Robinhood, if your money is in Robinhood for"
"4098520","4105580"," us to start this this challenge I don't feel I feel responsible to be like oh yeah let's release"
"4105580","4109380"," run it once or twice then we'll move money over to Weebo because you never fucking know they could"
"4109380","4115220"," be like tomorrow they fucking say oh fuck you by the way fuck your fucking spreads do eat a bag"
"4115220","4119500"," of dicks and like you know a thousand bucks might not be anything to me but I know some of"
"4119500","4123840"," you motherfuckers that's like your fucking paycheck for two weeks or you've got a wife and kids and"
"4123840","4127680"," you fucking I don't know you save this shit up and hit it for your wife or some shit so"
"4127680","4132920"," I know that's not for everybody but this this this trade is geared towards uh traders to make"
"4132920","4133960"," consistent money. "
"4134240","4139740"," So well we need to talk about that at some point today maybe we switched the money from Robinhood"
"4139740","4144180"," and maybe I'll look up today it's some if I have something I'll take a break today and see if"
"4144180","4151060"," Weebo offers like spreads and stuff and maybe we'll just do like a video on signing up for Weebo or"
"4151060","4157020"," some shit and rolling a thousand bucks in there and we'll make the trade there okay I think that's"
"4157020","4160620"," the prudent thing to do especially you know if you're a new fucking trader out there take this as a"
"4160620","4170300"," goddamn warning okay take this as a fucking warning in Robinhood uh they are ripe for a buyout"
"4170300","4177279"," right down here for a buyout for a cash offer trust me there are fucking people in here right that"
"4177279","4182720"," are fucking long Weebo for like 80 fucking dollars I think they opened at 30 and then they maxed"
"4182720","4186580"," out at 80 or something I don't know I don't know exactly anymore what it was I remember when this"
"4186580","4191040"," trade happened I think it was tick I think he mini tick or tick tick tick whatever his name is"
"4191040","4197280"," out there I think he fucking took this long it was like fucking sell it or something and everybody"
"4197280","4205380"," fucking sold and I know I fucking know I've got my first post on fucking Robinhood on twitter you"
"4205380","4210200"," can search them going back to the beginning and I was like fuck no I ain't taking this trade down"
"4210200","4214800"," here I ain't getting caught in this this shit's going to zero I know I said that shit back here"
"4214800","4219140"," and I wanted nothing to fucking do it he made a bank in here and his followers did too but"
"4219720","4224180"," so I got to give props to that but dude you know what it's been ever since one straight fucking"
"4224180","4230200"," shot to hell in this will this will get bought someone's gonna go in there and fucking scoop this"
"4230200","4234000"," shit up and you're gonna get caught with your with holding your balls in your hands take this"
"4234000","4238360"," fucking warning I'm gonna try to cut this I can't actually edit these videos the live streams in"
"4238360","4243380"," like eight hours but I wish I could because I'd fucking cut this shit out the speech I just gave"
"4243380","4248380"," you and I fucking promise you okay this shit will come back to haunt you out there this shit's"
"4248380","4252660"," gonna come back and fucking haunt your ass it could be tomorrow it could be in three months"
"4252660","4257080"," whatever the fuck there you are statements gonna be it ain't gonna matter they can stroke it all"
"4257080","4261780"," they want but when you start to see guys like Ross Gerber and you whether you like them or not"
"4261780","4266740"," guys like that don't come out out of nowhere and tell you and warn you get your shit out of"
"4266740","4272040"," there right now and they did that during GME I remember during GME people were like get your"
"4272040","4278000"," fucking money out right fucking now and people didn't not out of hood but when they had when they"
"4278000","4283240"," were leaving their money thinking there they were gonna allow them to trade right they weren't"
"4283240","4287940"," gonna allow you to trade the fucking banks don't lose they're going to fucking bend you over and"
"4287940","4294020"," butt fuck you if you butt fuck them and that's what happened they got butt fuck and and so what"
"4294020","4297680"," so that they weren't gonna let it happen no matter what you hear read the news they weren't fucking"
"4297680","4304080"," let it happen and when you understood that and when you can unfuck yourself in that GME trade okay"
"4304080","4310360"," please listen to that advice so think about that as the days move forward with hood look up what"
"4310360","4315480"," Gerber said this morning it's critical what he said in pointing what he said he's probably behind"
"4315480","4320600"," whoever the fuck's gonna buy it you know there's probably a motivation there's probably paid to say"
"4320600","4324660"," that state make that statement this morning so there's probably some sharks out there just swimming"
"4324660","4331320"," down here waiting for a chance to buy it much lower got him fucking ran this morning you guys tuned"
"4331320","4345370"," in to watch book map nice little recovery down below here on the spy bull's"

"4362250","4370390"," time and bleed you off down here that's their intent down here is to send you lower down to 410"

"19606070","19615490"," you're set up already for that further decline down to 400 into next week into the fourth so here"
"19615490","19622970"," we go again it's like a killing me right and then you know where do you buy this right you're"
"19622970","19627350"," buying it on the true capitulation move the point 90 percent we didn't see it was a point eight"

"19688550","19693930"," they trade it down here again you get your good reports and January was similar if you look back on"
"19693930","19701490"," January it was quite similar uh we'll look back over here again let me see when we're just back"

"20103040","20109480"," these reports even when they're outstanding and even with that being said look larger even if you"
"20109480","20116100"," had apple come out and said we farted rainbows out you're still only getting to let's say 430 435"
