"38540","43660"," Is that, is that, uh, is that Winky in the house this morning?"
"47250","48630"," Hello, what's going on there?"
"49030","49470"," subscribers."
"50650","51750"," Guys are hilarious."
"54630","56210"," Okay, uh, save. "
"68760","69780"," Second boys, girls."
"75790","77170"," Good morning, everybody out there."
"86280","87120"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"87980","91440"," See if I can hear all you guys out there, just a second here."
"94870","97230"," All kinds of stuff going on this morning, huh?"
"97610","98910"," Let me see what I can hear you guys this morning."
"115060","115840"," All right. "
"116020","117100"," Your brain is coming in this morning."
"119720","121900"," Just blow right over to it and see what's up."
"122900","124480"," Let's just get right into it this morning. "
"127350","129330"," I don't even got to waste too much time here."
"130210","131850"," Tesla's selling off this morning."
"132750","134430"," I know that makes some of you very happy. "
"139770","147660"," Uh, you know, I was speaking with someone that, uh, yeah, true Tesla bull."
"149980","153040"," And, uh, you know, he made a fair point."
"153160","158240"," Doesn't matter if you like it, just like, uh, Elon Musk or, uh, Tesla. "
"158680","165180"," You know, he's got, um, he's got fanboys and fangirls for Tesla."
"165640","167020"," He's got fanboys for space X."
"167220","176040"," He's got fanboys, um, for Neuralink and, you know, he's not, he doesn't quite have that yet for"
"176040","176840"," Twitter."
"177220","177540"," You're right?"
"177540","182260"," And he actually has, he has a, there's some infighting with the Tesla gang too. "
"182900","183480"," Right now."
"183640","188060"," And he, I mean, I guess there's that one aspect of cleaning house and his, from his perspective."
"188780","194920"," And also, um, you know, when does it switch to trying to create a fan base for Twitter?"
"195800","197980"," You know, who really hasn't had too much of a fan base. "
"198500","207520"," Um, you know, Twitter has, Twitter's had warring factions since being, so maybe they'll always"
"207520","209860"," have, uh, just on this opening bell this morning, we'll take a quick look at the market."
"210100","213400"," Uh, we've got seven minutes left, so we'll just have a quick talk here."
"215340","216820"," This morning, we'll get into some other stuff. "
"216980","218040"," I did post some videos."
"219920","222220"," So they were deleting accounts this morning on Twitter."
"222520","227660"," If you posted a video, the videos from Chappelle last night, they were just outright banning"
"227660","228040"," people. "
"228240","232900"," And then I think someone from, there were some other people posting it without going up on a"
"232900","233100"," Twitter."
"233660","235400"," Some Reddit accounts got slammed this morning."
"236500","242520"," Uh, so I started, I posted the first one, and then I saw that a guy from Wired or some"
"242520","245700"," magazine started posting some as well. "
"246500","249880"," Uh, so I got the other three posted those this morning, but I didn't post them on Twitter."
"250420","256120"," What's funny is this morning, I couldn't, this morning, I couldn't post any videos to Twitter."
"257140","260740"," Like, have nothing to do with, with, uh, that Chappelle stuff last night. "
"261280","266460"," I think that my account's been some, some is some kind of shadow banner lock on it at this point."
"266980","270460"," Uh, so that didn't even take that long to find out, uh, who I am, which is kind of wild."
"270760","275700"," Of course, I don't have half a million followers, so I can't go telling people where those videos"
"275700","276200"," are posted. "
"276700","280120"," Now, this morning, uh, you remember to the bell, yeah."
"280220","285300"," So I did delete the red bar from over here this morning in the green bar above, but we knew"
"285300","288340"," last week, uh, we knew a couple things last week, right?"
"288860","292040"," We didn't know if we'd be able to come up until Friday or Monday."
"292760","297480"," And then as the week progressed here, we noticed that there were opportunities everywhere to sell"
"297480","298060"," this market. "
"298220","303080"," We were, uh, some of us were up awake, I believe here, right, on the seventh at like two o "
"303080","303660","'clock in the morning."
"304620","306140"," And you saw the same thing."
"306180","311120"," There were, there were no bids in the market and right out of nowhere, just like a lightning bolt"
"311120","312820"," boom steps right in and boom. "
"312980","314500"," There's a bid in the market in the middle of the night."
"314900","316100"," They wouldn't let it sell off."
"316420","316560"," Okay. "
"316960","318520"," Same thing in cash market."
"318880","322520"," All strength sold right into all strength sold right into."
"323340","326860"," Um, and then the same thing into the bell on Friday. "
"327120","332660"," It's like the whole was there, but at the same time you close, you close for profit down here."
"332720","335720"," We talked about both sides of this."
"335760","336880"," They were parking this, right?"
"337060","337700"," They were parking this. "
"337700","342420"," We looked at this earlier in the week and showed an implied move, right?"
"342520","344300"," We talked about think of this like an ER."
"344840","349820"," They're going to try to just bring it like just pin it right to that three ninety five."
"350200","351780"," And that's basically what they've done at this point. "
"352320","357220"," Now, uh, I'm going to get into have a this week's news brief."
"357220","361820"," I sent it off to have it looked at and then published and sent to the email."
"362840","366920"," That has not happened, I guess, at this point, if I don't, if I, if you don't get it at"
"366920","371460"," some point this morning, I'll just the copy that I sent, I'll turn it into a PDF this morning. "
"372140","376500"," And I'll post it on that captain's alpha for you so we can discuss that this morning in this"
"376500","376780"," afternoon."
"377020","379080"," Now, just looking at the day today, right?"
"381280","383620"," After you read this report, I'm going to tell you one thing."
"384160","385840"," Treat the CPI report on its own. "
"386360","388200"," It doesn't matter how they try to spin it."
"388400","389040"," It doesn't matter."
"389480","391820"," They could, they could, they could try to spin it any way they want. "
"391900","392680"," It doesn't really matter."
"392680","395820"," The thing that you need to know is that, well, a couple of things."
"396020","396540"," First, PPI. "
"397780","399840"," It doesn't matter what the, what the producers pay."
"400080","401360"," What does, but it doesn't."
"402080","402940"," Uh, consider price index. "
"404000","409920"," It's going, or, uh, so if I'm the, the end retailer, I will, I will lose money sometimes, uh, for"
"409920","414440"," years in like a decade long, uh, non repricing, right?"
"414720","419260"," You already know that you priced, uh, produces every, uh, or excuse me."
"420460","422280"," Retail companies have already reprised their products."
"423060","427720"," Uh, so it's not going to really matter if PPI can't slightly, or the, uh, PPI had already come"
"427720","428060"," slightly. "
"428900","430860"," Uh, this can get spun any way they want to spin it."
"430880","431480"," It doesn't matter."
"431640","436780"," Any kind of narrative they want to send to you heading into, uh, the, the federal funds rate"
"436780","437180"," decision. "
"437860","439600"," They're going to, they're going to spin anyway."
"439820","440360"," That doesn't matter."
"440640","444900"," I would expect though, the one thing that I would want to tell you is that I would expect that,"
"444900","452980"," uh, heading into, uh, the, the rate decision, uh, as long as the note closed down here, I would"
"452980","455680"," expect it to slingshot back up or at least hold. "
"456240","458000"," In here into the day."
"458120","461580"," The same thing I would expect, um, up here at 400."
"461960","465300"," As long as they don't close above it, uh, I'm not going to call that bullish either. "
"465300","469640"," I'm going to expect any kind of any kind of a, um, any kind of a."
"470600","472060"," Remember the report has received."
"472260","473040"," It really doesn't matter."
"473400","477420"," Uh, now today if we were closed under, uh, 3900 down here. "
"477420","478380"," Uh, yeah."
"479140","480600"," I'd be scared heading into CPI."
"481260","483320"," Uh, and then we'll be looking to go down. "
"483440","488960"," We'll talk on a, we'll talk about heading down lower into CPI and into, well, that's, well, the"
"488960","489700"," discussion today."
"491040","497780"," Uh, how far down we can go and the bears holding it under and, uh, the implication."
"498080","501020"," We'll talk about as well where the gamma is in the market. "
"501300","501720"," There's some gamma."
"501720","507260"," You know, that we're pretty much guaranteed, not guaranteed, but there's a, there's a fair chance"
"507260","509540"," that no matter what the decisions are."
"510320","516059"," That heading into OPEC, we're going to head down to, uh, some lower levels, not, not guaranteed,"
"516500","516580"," but. "
"517200","520539"," Uh, 380 definitely there just waiting, right?"
"520880","522620"," We all know it's just sitting there waiting for us."
"522760","527320"," The options market is looking like it can easily head."
"528880","529680"," Down there. "
"529940","530180"," And then."
"531640","535360"," After the options, Claire and Opex, there is probably a fair chance."
"536060","538920"," Uh, if we're oversold enough, right?"
"539160","542980"," That to maybe get a nice van about some repositioning on the market. "
"543620","546520"," And also when that repositioning takes place after."
"547560","548780"," Uh, not so much CPI."
"549040","551940"," I'll show you guys why CPI CPI really really doesn't matter. "
"552100","554440"," You'd have to have like a blow out hot CPI."
"555260","559880"," Like blow out talking like double, double digit blow out."
"560500","566360"," Uh, when you're, when you're looking at it over time, uh, inflation's coming down and it's going to"
"566360","567520"," rapidly come down. "
"567640","572020"," And I'll show you examples of it rapidly coming down in the past in these same situations."
"572920","575940"," Um, so we'll talk about that stuff as we move up, move forward."
"576620","581180"," Um, but there, there's, you know, I'm getting more bearish into this event as time goes on. "
"581280","583900"," That's what I was saying this morning was watch them rip it high because."
"583900","586880"," Because the thought would be that we're going to head down."
"587180","589760"," So the higher they are, the more they can dump it. "
"590660","592680"," Uh, so we'll take a look at today at how this goes."
"592920","594400"," I have a feeling they're going to rip it today."
"595080","601420"," Uh, mostly because of the selling that's going to probably take place and we'll go over the entire"
"601420","602000"," thing today. "
"602500","609220"," Um, uh, I think that's going to be the key point for today is, uh, is this, this report that"
"609220","611380"," I wrote and, uh, some expectations."
"612440","613860"," Now heading into the next couple days."
"615880","619740"," So let me put the book map up back up for you here so you guys are panicking or whatever. "
"620800","624600"," And I will, um, I'll turn this into a small chart for you."
"625720","627920"," Uh, nice little green bar right off the bell."
"628220","629800"," I'm expecting us to go up here today. "
"630240","635600"," And I think it's due to the, I think it's due to some expectations of us."
"636520","638980"," Um, head and lower here."
"640980","648880"," Into into, um, CPI, or not CPI, but, uh, the Fed funds rate decision. "
"650220","652460"," To get this a little bit clearer for you here."
"653440","655060"," Maybe, maybe I can do it."
"655280","656620"," Um, just second here. "
"657000","659880"," Yeah, and this, uh, this is S2 over here."
"660660","662480"," And I made it red today."
"663060","665520"," Bears really want to see this as close below 3,900. "
"665520","668420"," Uh, this is kind of like the place, right?"
"668660","671760"," It's kind of the place for bears to have some conviction."
"673000","676580"," And, uh, for the bulls, they really want to get it above 400."
"677200","679160"," And I'm going to really expect today. "
"679400","680520"," Let's look at book map real quick."
"694270","699130"," I don't know exactly what's going on with my, uh, having some book map issues right now."
"715150","716670"," You know, I might end up doing hairs. "
"717050","718050"," Give me just a second here."
"718130","727830"," I think I'm going to, um, I'm going to reboot book map this morning."
"739210","741290"," Book map is hot and saucy at this time. "
"749080","750100"," Let me just second here."
"750160","750680"," I got to grab something."
"838410","838990"," All right. "
"839310","840490"," I'm loading it back up right now."
"840550","841250"," It should be just a moment."
"842730","843650"," Bear with me here. "
"862440","864820"," See if I can spin this book map back up for you."
"885350","887150"," Some heavy resistance right now."
"908750","910270"," A little more sellers and buyers. "
"911150","911650"," All right."
"911710","915030"," Let me just check in with you guys and see what's, what's going on here."
"915030","915430"," Let's go in. "
"915510","916030"," Let's go first."
"916210","921910"," Let's go through your, uh, let's go through your, uh, good morning, Michael."
"922030","922650"," Good morning, Winky. "
"922870","923370"," What's up, brother?"
"924290","925190"," Good morning, John."
"925330","925550"," Good morning."
"925690","925970"," Faison. "
"926290","927210"," Good morning, Dylan Ross."
"928570","928930"," Garrett."
"929610","930170"," John's in the house. "
"930450","930510"," Eric."
"930690","931050"," Good morning."
"931470","931690"," Ergo. "
"932350","932710"," Boomer."
"932790","933130"," Good morning."
"933310","933830"," Good to see you, brother. "
"934390","935050"," Haven't seen you in a bit."
"935430","936130"," Hey, Ben Brent, Ben."
"936990","937690"," Faison's in the house. "
"937990","940030"," Guru room."
"940030","940530"," He's in the house."
"941350","942110"," Mikey's in the house. "
"942410","942770"," Ryan."
"943290","943950"," Legend X."
"944130","944850"," Two, two X."
"945930","946730"," Take a mornin' everybody."
"946910","947290"," Stephen Hunter. "
"947990","949350"," I didn't mean to catch up with you."
"950190","951730"," I want to catch up with you at some point."
"952030","953830"," I was thinking about doing an interview with you. "
"954950","957550"," So I, uh, Stephen Hunter's an interesting man."
"957730","959190"," So I'd like to hang out with him at some point."
"959970","960970"," I'm going to come find him. "
"961690","962730"," Joshua, good morning, Patrick."
"962950","963470"," Blind Nestile."
"963730","963890"," Teagan. "
"964610","965350"," Herushi's in the house."
"967190","967410"," Chase."
"967650","968550"," Good morning, my man. "
"969170","969190"," Dean."
"969830","969950"," Matthew."
"971730","974650"," He has all the dick pics that I get in my DMs, right?"
"976410","977270"," That's too funny. "
"979410","980670"," Jay Cartina, good morning."
"980910","981230"," Chance, too."
"981370","982070"," Gary Sheltz. "
"982330","982750"," How are you?"
"984150","986010"," Uh, Tesla dumping yikes."
"986250","987810"," Yeah, I haven't taken a look at this point."
"988330","995690"," Kind of sucks because Tesla, uh, in reversing right now is, uh, could be a really bad thing. "
"995990","999670"," You could see, uh, this reversal here."
"999670","1003190"," It might open the door to one thirties."
"1004030","1005710"," We'll take a look at Tesla at some point. "
"1006150","1008210"," And the sellers are coming in right off the bat this morning."
"1008970","1010530"," You can see him on book map, right?"
"1010670","1011530"," They're not even giving it a chance."
"1012090","1014110"," They were like, they were like, hell no, you're not even getting. "
"1014510","1017450"," They're like, you're not even getting that to, to, to the pivot point."
"1017750","1019350"," We're just taking you down here."
"1026030","1028130"," Like, sellers are just like hell no. "
"1028130","1037650"," Uh, Jay Strz is saying that it might be a trend j, trend j, which means to mean higher."
"1038130","1038390"," Yeah."
"1038609","1040030"," If, you know, I'll be honest with you. "
"1041690","1042730"," Uh, we can."
"1043790","1045349"," I mean, I'll tell you the truth, right?"
"1046790","1048050"," If, if they're."
"1049310","1054470"," The idea behind the trend day is, well, you know, in my mind, this morning, when I woke up, right?"
"1054470","1058870"," I was like, we should be sideways and weak into the clothes. "
"1059990","1061470"," Waiting for CPI tomorrow."
"1061970","1064630"," Should be a side sideways and down day."
"1065790","1068250"," And so I'm like, I'm going to draw this green check. "
"1068450","1069830"," Or I'm going to go draw this green arrow."
"1070730","1074690"," And I'm going to, I'm going to give it like a chance to get to the pivot or, or, or,"
"1074690","1076590"," or one possible R one."
"1077170","1082850"," And then I posted it and I said, you know, because I think this is probably going to rip our"
"1082850","1083250"," two. "
"1083830","1086150"," And especially if we're going to sell off on."
"1087550","1092370"," On CPI or sell off on because the more we sell off, right?"
"1093430","1096490"," The more, the more chance that we're going to get a, a ball crush."
"1096590","1099090"," And we'll talk about the interplay on that today, too. "
"1099910","1101670"," Depending on what they say, right?"
"1101870","1102450"," Forget forget."
"1102450","1103050"," Forget CPI."
"1103550","1104570"," Depending on what they say. "
"1104690","1107450"," This fed federal fund rate decision."
"1109250","1111730"," If we get ball crush, depending on what they say."
"1113330","1118330"," There could be like a banner rally that day or there, or if not there, there's some really weird"
"1118330","1119830"," interplay here as to what's going to take place. "
"1120050","1121090"," We'll go over every part of it."
"1122170","1124110"," What does 75 BPS mean?"
"1125150","1127090"," We'll go over what it's meant historically in the past."
"1127830","1128310"," We'll go over. "
"1130530","1131450"," Staying the course."
"1132450","1133070"," 50 BPS."
"1134270","1136730"," Hit the terminal rate heading into next year. "
"1136730","1137930"," Pause and watch and hold."
"1138770","1140830"," I'll show you what they're looking for."
"1141190","1144650"," People didn't want to hear me this morning saying people are really angry. "
"1144830","1145910"," I think this morning to some extent."
"1148450","1154470"," You know, that's funny about this, too, is that people get upset when you say things like we need"
"1154470","1157370"," or the fed and the treasury want."
"1157390","1159850"," They want to destroy the employment. "
"1161330","1163090"," They don't want to say that publicly."
"1164310","1169170"," Although they do say it publicly, they know that most people do not have."
"1169750","1172870"," A financial education of any kind. "
"1173910","1177510"," So this is people that even go into college for liberal arts degree."
"1178330","1179550"," I just don't."
"1179670","1184290"," And so the way that federal officials will sometimes choose their words. "
"1185650","1186850"," It's clear enough."
"1188610","1189890"," To anyone with a basic."
"1192150","1194690"," Taking an econ 101 class that could do not. "
"1195450","1196410"," It's that simple."
"1196570","1198290"," So to me, Yellen."
"1199610","1201390"," Was saying as much on Sunday. "
"1205670","1206850"," It's not quite lying."
"1206890","1209230"," It's saying something out of one side of your mouth."
"1210390","1212470"," But meaning something else to anyone that. "
"1213410","1214590"," Has an idea."
"1215930","1216770"," And that's really what they need."
"1216810","1219230"," Now, I'll show you that historically what they mean by that. "
"1219230","1221650"," But what she meant by that on Sunday."
"1223410","1225490"," And how they they're going to have it."
"1225730","1227050"," We're not seeing it right now. "
"1229760","1231660"," A cap center to report your Twitter."
"1231900","1232140"," Thank you."
"1232140","1232900"," Appreciate that chase. "
"1234780","1235820"," Let me see what you're saying."
"1237680","1238120"," Yeah."
"1238200","1239520"," I want you guys to realize something too. "
"1239740","1241700"," I want you guys to be clear with you guys in some this morning."
"1241700","1241980"," Okay."
"1243300","1246400"," If you guys here, if you guys hear things like. "
"1246920","1248440"," There can be a van a rally."
"1249340","1251280"," There can be a ball crash rally."
"1251700","1253220"," There can be a Santa rally. "
"1254160","1255620"," Any of those things, right?"
"1257400","1258820"," Be very aware."
"1260120","1262220"," That they're not what they're not telling you is."
"1263540","1265540"," You'll get the Santa rally from right here. "
"1267140","1269720"," Or that you'll get the van a rally from right here."
"1272240","1275340"," Sometimes we can we can blast down a three at three eighty."
"1275340","1278440"," And then you'll get your van a rally, right?"
"1278820","1280560"," You'll get your Santa rally down there. "
"1281060","1282220"," So I want you to be careful."
"1284220","1287080"," Oftentimes when I see those posts, I'm like, yeah, I agree with this."
"1289900","1293800"," You don't know when it's going to happen and what the price will be when it happens. "
"1295180","1298820"," So if you're a bull out there and you don't trade both sides."
"1301100","1303920"," If you're just like, I'm in long when it's appropriate to."
"1303920","1309080"," I think sometimes bulls get caught in when you take that van a trade. "
"1309500","1312760"," Or when you take that Santa trade or when you take that ball crash track trade."
"1313540","1314760"," I'll just be conscious of that."
"1314860","1318000"," And the ball crash trade can happen in two different places. "
"1318820","1319520"," Price wise."
"1323160","1324500"," Let's see what else you guys are saying here."
"1334440","1338900"," Yeah, no, it's it's the implication is that they're going to come in and try to sell out the sworn"
"1338900","1339560"," hands down. "
"1340400","1341900"," You're going to hands down to see that."
"1347090","1353870"," And the question is, do the do the dealers help in here to not let it get pushed down?"
"1354030","1355110"," That would be the push up."
"1355290","1361410"," The push up would be just the dealers hedging against so much negativity in the market today. "
"1363050","1365170"," Is the point behind why we would go up."
"1367230","1368230"," I appreciate that chase."
"1368350","1369050"," I'll take a look at it. "
"1373030","1374330"," No, I don't think you're reading it wrong."
"1374490","1375450"," I think that it matters."
"1375910","1377810"," I don't think you're reading it wrong, Chase. "
"1378010","1383570"," I think how people read these things wrong is they get in their mind that it's at the price right"
"1383570","1384090"," now."
"1385010","1385190"," Right?"
"1385530","1385950"," It's going to hold."
"1386130","1386570"," It's going to hold. "
"1387050","1389330"," We're going to get the ball crash and it's going to blast blast north."
"1391390","1395190"," There's a lot of positioning in this market for at least three three eighty and tow pecs."
"1397410","1399370"," Lower you need to see waterfall plugs. "
"1400090","1403890"," Good morning, Floyd's garage."
"1403990","1404630"," Good morning, Tommy."
"1408750","1410310"," ZDNA will be a week, about twenty bucks. "

"1412230","1412410"," Good morning. "
"1413110","1413690"," Can't know the great."
"1414270","1414650"," Morning, Mark."
"1414830","1415170"," Morning, DJ. "
"1416090","1416410"," Morning, John."
"1416610","1417110"," How are you?"
"1417110","1419370"," Good morning, Steve."
"1419510","1420330"," Good morning, brother. "
"1421930","1423250"," I'm going to contact you, Rand."
"1423610","1424250"," Stocks anonymous."
"1424250","1424790"," Good morning. "
"1424930","1425850"," More in GMM."
"1426190","1426710"," More in RS."
"1430090","1430570"," Yeah. "
"1430850","1432750"," He really has some building to do."
"1433070","1438590"," He really, I mean, I've seen, so I've seen people come in and clean out companies, whether they"
"1438590","1439590"," actually believe it or not."
"1441630","1443930"," So I can kind it to an extent. "
"1443930","1453390"," I can see it happens,"
"1453430","1463210"," now, what he's choosing to clean the company with is an acceptable man that really"
"1463210","1470710"," is, and it's not TMZ, it really isn't, I mean it really is not TMZ."
"1470710","1480470"," I talked one bit of post once about the pantheon, the plabs and people thinking that they're"
"1480470","1482650"," taking a side on something and you're really not."
"1483290","1484270"," It's really bizarre. "
"1487150","1497110"," I love Elon, you guys already know I love Elon, so I know that there's some Hello, what are you"
"1497110","1497650"," guys saying here?"
"1500970","1503470"," Well, let me see what you guys saying here and we'll go over some stuff here."
"1505190","1506030"," UNG to the roof."
"1508170","1512470"," The gas, you guys went under the gas trade today maybe if there's money over there, still money,"
"1513430","1515190"," still waiting for a dip in CVNA. "
"1516670","1517610"," What you thoughts on Elon?"
"1518350","1525830"," You know, I watched the videos and let's see if we can get some action on this."
"1529460","1530800"," We'll see what this sets up here."
"1537840","1540540"," You know the point of control is right here, right?"
"1540800","1542980"," You know this is negative gamma, I want you to be aware of this. "
"1542980","1548360"," Let's look on the 15 minute chart real quick so you guys can have some perspective."
"1554700","1556100"," So I get to see here, right?"
"1556380","1557500"," Came right straight down here, right?"
"1557780","1558120"," Blast it off."
"1558300","1560120"," This is if this is any other week, right?"
"1560300","1561020"," You saw this move. "
"1561880","1564120"," Everybody looked in the five and 15 minute towards the close."
"1564280","1565960"," It was right up here and I was like, you guys see this?"
"1566440","1568100"," And then I walked you back over here."
"1568400","1573620"," Last time we had that happen and you start to see that hook over. "
"1573900","1577100"," You saw that blast down any other time, right?"
"1578280","1581080"," Any other time this would have been a 100 point move lower."
"1581760","1583700"," 70, 80, 100 points, easy."
"1585460","1586640"," And they just stopped it. "
"1586980","1587680"," And but you're seeing it."
"1591220","1594080"," You know, you could have this trade higher to the pivot point again, possibly."
"1595660","1597340"," But what happens here, right?"
"1597580","1600240"," Do they trade it higher and then you reverse right back off it again?"
"1602460","1603900"," You know, you can trade the level. "
"1603900","1606360"," You can trade at the pivot point, maybe trade the level up here."
"1607120","1609600"," I would be going level to level and this stuff at best."
"1610300","1613000"," And I would assume you already know you have sellers here. "
"1613100","1613900"," You have sellers here."
"1614660","1617400"," You know, the argument could be made that there's a big old."
"1619160","1620660"," Squeeze going to be going higher here. "
"1621900","1622640"," Into today."
"1624680","1627060"," But if you're going to take that trade, it's level level here."
"1627340","1628020"," I promise you. "
"1628280","1629900"," So definitely level to level."
"1635790","1636790"," Nice little first."
"1637870","1639990"," I haven't checked the volume on the day at this morning. "
"1641090","1642810"," It's only 700,000."
"1642990","1644870"," 700,000 buys the five minute."
"1646610","1650050"," And decision so far here in this next candle. "
"1651750","1657010"," Not not really forming anything that I'd be tempted on so far."
"1657250","1658610"," And you also want to see like."
"1658610","1661450"," You can see VWAP coming down here. "
"1661750","1662950"," We're above VWAP now."
"1663390","1664090"," It's getting bullish."
"1664890","1667150"," You guys count candles if you're looking for a quick three minute trade. "
"1667870","1668890"," You get the first green bar."
"1669930","1671650"," You waiting for that second green bar."
"1673110","1674250"," And we do have a set. "
"1674470","1675950"," We know we sold off the bell down here."
"1676470","1678130"," We've got VWAP sitting here."
"1678370","1682410"," If this next one's a green bar, it's going to start trying to at least blast up here. "
"1683490","1684830"," And tag this level right here."
"1684970","1686370"," Probably we'll call that 39463."
"1693080","1694520"," I got stuff to show you guys. "
"1694620","1695940"," You guys want to see some stuff this morning?"
"1698580","1699860"," I got some cool stuff for you."
"1700440","1701880"," Let me know if you want to see some stuff."
"1703020","1703460"," Oh yeah. "
"1703620","1705220"," Nice little push higher going on right now."
"1723620","1724020"," Wow."
"1724020","1724580"," Is this questionable?"
"1728990","1729390"," Yeah. "
"1729650","1731270"," Well, I'll show you guys all this stuff."
"1731490","1731910"," Well, here we go."
"1731910","1733470"," Nice blast up here. "
"1737510","1740590"," Well, you're going to if you're a bull, you want to take it at level level."
"1740590","1741510"," You look at it."
"1741590","1742790"," Or you're looking up here to close this gap. "
"1742790","1743770"," I should clean this up."
"1744110","1745970"," We're going to close this gap right now."
"1747790","1750990"," The next trade will be, of course, off pivot to R1. "
"1753780","1755680"," I don't even have a broker joke right now."
"1756180","1757060"," Haven't even looked."
"1757520","1759540"," Been closing out hedges. "
"1761200","1763140"," And I got a little bit more hedge left on."
"1763260","1764800"," I'm going to try to get right up today if I can."
"1765660","1767440"," I might have to hold it at the end of the day. "
"1770900","1771920"," Here's R1 over there."
"1775540","1776940"," Looks like they're cleaning up this."
"1777120","1779460"," There's a little bit of a gap over here that needs cleaned up. "
"1782030","1783690"," We'll see if we can trade it higher if they're not."
"1788230","1789970"," Keep your eye on the on book map."
"1790170","1791090"," There's that small resistance. "
"1791690","1796010"," We'll take a look above from here and see if it can break above where it's looking for where it's"
"1796010","1796510"," looking to go."
"1812160","1812560"," 3999."
"1814440","1815240"," That's pretty big. "
"1815240","1816060"," It's pretty big up there."
"1816180","1816520"," 3999."
"1817000","1819100"," You see that small white bar coming in at the top there. "
"1821580","1821980"," 3990."
"1825140","1826460"," Right up here are two."
"1826880","1828920"," So we'll see if they can start to work its way up today. "
"1828920","1833780"," Or if it will just be more, you know, it's like just like Friday, right?"
"1834580","1835740"," It's got a normal day."
"1835900","1839300"," If this wasn't an event week, I'd be like, yeah, we're going up there."
"1839400","1840300"," We're going to tag 3999. "
"1840520","1842260"," You're going to see that open wide open."
"1842560","1844440"," So I don't know if we get that."
"1844580","1847720"," They'll just be feeding into any strength this morning. "
"1850900","1852180"," See what you guys are saying here."
"1852940","1856480"," They jacked up IV significantly right up from CCPI since Friday morning."
"1856740","1858840"," So to me, then the kid's potential for rip after MCN. "
"1858960","1859320"," Volcrush."
"1859860","1860060"," Yeah."
"1860200","1860360"," Okay. "
"1860500","1865900"," So that's going to, that's going to, it depends on what they say."
"1869200","1871500"," So you're going to get initial reaction off."
"1871500","1873340"," Of course, you're going to get the initial reaction, right?"
"1874140","1874760"," Name what they say. "
"1876960","1879220"," That move, if it's positive."
"1882000","1885100"," Should sell off or possibly continue with Volcrush, right?"
"1885600","1888840"," Maybe depending on how high we go first day in the second day."
"1890700","1892180"," If it's bad news, right?"
"1893400","1897580"," We could just start trading down and we'll talk about all the different. "
"1897820","1899520"," You guys can get a pen and paper this morning."
"1900280","1900960"," Write it all down."
"1901280","1905600"," If this, then what, or what would you think would happen depending on what they say. "
"1911080","1913220"," Oh shit, you know what, I didn't post it on Twitter."
"1914020","1915760"," Let me, hold on a second here."
"1917120","1919960"," Let me, give me a second and I'll post it on Twitter. "
"1923900","1925600"," I didn't even think to post this on Twitter."
"1925820","1927000"," I was having problems this morning."
"1927600","1938620"," I think I got, I think I'm almost sure I got some kind of a, not full shadow band, but"
"1938620","1944840"," I definitely got a shadow band from posting a straight video on my regular handle this morning. "
"1945360","1951080"," I'm assuming that they knew that somehow they were able to figure out, man, they know what's up."
"1951820","1963230"," So let me, yeah, they're"
"1963230","1964190"," like checking me."
"1964910","1966330"," They're straight checking me. "
"1971240","1978280"," Tell you what, Elon's got the stuff out this morning."
"1982460","1990150"," Yeah, almost a perfect tag off pivot."
"1990370","1991110"," You see that right there?"
"1991370","1992790"," Almost perfect tag off pivot. "
"1993110","1996030"," Look at that, almost a perfect pin strike."
"1996870","2000890"," It's kind of nice to see people straighten levels exactly."
"2004590","2006370"," This looks like a low volume date. "
"2006470","2008010"," Is it looking like a low volume date, you guys out there?"
"2008010","2009230"," And look at that."
"2009370","2014050"," Look at the, look at, look at how book maps acting this morning."
"2017890","2020750"," Then down again, it might be that bearish, garlic setup. "
"2021390","2024410"," There was one moment during that six minutes every that I thought was super important, but then I"
"2024410","2024970"," forgot about it."
"2025670","2029310"," Yeah, so there was a, there was a, we could replay that video if you want this morning."
"2029510","2036010"," There was a moment in there where Yellen was basically saying she needed to destroy the middle"
"2036010","2039830"," class and the, in the lower income people. "
"2040030","2042490"," I mean, that was basically what she was saying."
"2042950","2044050"," And I'll show you why."
"2044250","2045650"," I'll show you exactly why. "
"2046390","2054110"," You know what, in the money, Adam made that video and he explained very well."
"2054969","2059130"," Maybe we'll take an in depth look at what his, or what he was talking about this morning."
"2059810","2065870"," So you guys can see maybe on a clearer picture of what he was trying to say to say in"
"2065870","2066350"," that video. "
"2066630","2070469"," So maybe we'll, I'll bring up the trading view and we'll plug in."
"2073090","2073830"," Let me see here."
"2073949","2076449"," We'll plug in some of those, some of those tickers. "
"2081590","2082630"," Give me just a second here."
"2095139","2095500"," Thanks."
"2095600","2096740"," Yeah, please give a thumbs up. "
"2096940","2102280"," Please subscribe if you haven't subscribed, but a thumbs up really do help me get to gain some"
"2102280","2102540"," traction."
"2103760","2106220"," I think it's because you already uploaded a few times today."
"2106880","2107340"," I see. "
"2108200","2108620"," Yeah."
"2108880","2110500"," So I've cut most of my heads."
"2110700","2112420"," I've got a little bit of heads left. "
"2114560","2119420"," I need to cut it loose at some point before the event ball goes away because I captured a ton,"
"2119840","2128180"," a ton of a ball premium, I mean, a ton, you know, it's crazy, had I done it like a"
"2128180","2130760"," week earlier, I probably would be up like three or four hundred percent."
"2130760","2133160"," That's how much vol is built into this event."
"2136180","2136580"," Volcrush. "
"2137060","2141920"," So, well, I've got a, I've got something I can show you in the vol for the event."
"2143520","2144660"," What is ballcrush?"
"2146300","2148920"," Something similar to last half of the marker of tie and reversed hard."
"2149740","2150100"," Oh, yep. "
"2151180","2151580"," Yeah."
"2152080","2152800"," Everybody's in here today."
"2153400","2155040"," Fade the knee jerk usually for your image. "
"2155500","2156860"," I didn't receive the newsletter this morning."
"2157360","2157600"," Okay."
"2157860","2158780"," I'll get one out to you. "
"2158780","2166360"," What I'll do is I'll create a PDF today and I'll post the tag captain's alpha in like a raw"
"2166360","2166740"," format."
"2167620","2168620"," You guys can read it."
"2168700","2169360"," You should read it. "
"2170020","2171360"," Do you guys want to read it right now?"
"2171780","2176320"," You want to do it right now so that before you even go into what to expect on Wednesday, you"
"2176320","2178940"," guys can go through the newsletter and figure it all out."
"2180660","2184700"," I'll start charting out testing for you guys while I do that or something."
"2184700","2185800"," Boils flying, baby. "
"2190950","2199590"," No, so what I'm doing is I've got a hedge that's a triple leverage Dow short for March, trying to"
"2199590","2200650"," capture a move lower."
"2201630","2206470"," And my letter this morning kind of explains how that would play out into March."
"2212670","2218450"," So I sent it off to a partner of mine to have him read it over it and see if"
"2218450","2221570"," he could get it emailed out to all of you this morning. "
"2223370","2224370"," There may have been issues."
"2224750","2229130"," Do you understand I write this stuff and then some people have to look at it and make sure them"
"2229130","2230050"," fucked everything up."
"2233070","2234230"," Yeah, you should have received it. "
"2235250","2236250"," Yeah, I'll do it right now."
"2236250","2237090"," Give me two minutes, right?"
"2237270","2238750"," What I'll do is I'll create a document."
"2239150","2240870"," I'll post it to Captain's offer right now. "
"2241330","2242490"," You guys can just read through it."
"2242590","2244510"," I recommend that you read through it, okay?"
"2245690","2250270"," I think I might have missed one part of the decision that they'll make that something different"
"2250270","2250610"," could happen."
"2250710","2253090"," But we'll look at that this morning too. "
"2253170","2254390"," You guys need to be prepped for this."
"2254650","2261130"," I need you guys to all understand what to expect in the coming two days, okay?"
"2261750","2265010"," So that you feel confident moving forward."
"2265010","2271590"," We just a minute here and I will, we just want to mute this conversation real quick. "
"2272090","2276650"," I'm going to take two, three minutes and try to create a PDF and post it up so you have"
"2276650","2280890"," access to it and then we'll start going through the actual charts so you can see what I'm talking"
"2280890","2281250"," about."
"2592180","2602110"," Okay, I just posted it to see if this works, it says this link might be unsafe but it's"
"2602110","2602290"," not."
"2603590","2613220"," Hold on, I have to view the document, see if I can delete"
"2614530","2616130"," this here and see if this helps. "
"2624670","2627010"," It says it might be an unsafe link but it's not."
"2630350","2633630"," And you can scroll through this and read the post that I have here."
"2633890","2637350"," It says it might be, my computer is saying it might be an unsafe link but it's not. "
"2638290","2647420"," This is a PDF copy, it's a PDF host.io, you can search the company, they're fine."
"2658530","2661250"," It did not, it did not view the data without protection."
"2662510","2663750"," That's not Captain's Alpha. "
"2664910","2667910"," If you guys want to bring it up right now for you, I'll show you exactly what it's saying to"
"2667910","2668090"," me."
"2670070","2674230"," So it's saying, you know, malicious links that could steal personal information."
"2674990","2676010"," This is a closed group. "
"2676010","2681090"," So I'll go through it with you guys right now, give me a second here."
"2681170","2683570"," If you guys don't want to download, you don't have to, we'll just go through it, okay."
"2685390","2686270"," Hold on a second here. "
"2689610","2693930"," We're just going to go through it right now, read it to you guys this morning so that you can,"
"2693990","2699550"," I'll read it to you, you can pause and come back to it and only be appropriate to launch a"
"2699550","2702550"," weekly newsletter during one of the busiest weeks of the year but first, happy holidays."
"2702830","2705750"," Seems like the past few years have been anything but easy, blah, blah, blah, blah."
"2705750","2707450"," You have a busy week, right?"
"2707630","2713750"," Federal funds rate announcement, fair and fair, fair, fair, fair, but I do need to say that the"
"2713750","2715430"," following is only my best guess. "
"2715690","2719610"," It should not be construed as financial advice and if it's wrong, it's often wrong."
"2720230","2721270"," It's often wrong, okay."
"2721390","2725450"," But I know that you want to clear a simple opinion, I'm expecting the Fed to maintain course to the"
"2725450","2732310"," terminal rate with 50 BPS this week and smaller rate increases next year, pausing rates to hammer"
"2732310","2734790"," down inflation and raise the unemployment rate. "
"2736310","2743530"," Further, there's a 30% chance of a 75 BPS coming into Wednesday, not insignificant risk."
"2743950","2746490"," I'm trading the CPI report as their own tradeable event."
"2746690","2750670"," They can be intentionally interpreted to be hot or cool to push a narrative. "
"2751390","2755830"," But I want to be clear unless CPS comes in raging hot, inflation is coming down and should"
"2755830","2758010"," accelerate down all of 2023."
"2758530","2759830"," The Fed is aware of this."
"2759910","2761810"," I want you to know that the Fed is aware of this, okay. "
"2762610","2765790"," Below is a corresponding inflation chart with previous instances."
"2766830","2771590"," This is also why the argument that the Fed is boxed into a corner rule and will announce cut sooner"
"2771590","2773270"," than expected is being floated."
"2774250","2777210"," The blue graph is inflation, the red graph is the Fed funds rate. "
"2778010","2783110"," I want you to see this inflation mark and this rollover back in 1974."
"2784470","2785530"," There's another one here."
"2785530","2788130"," I believe this is 1978 or 77. "
"2791530","2797330"," Now, you'll also note that the Fed funds rate, immediately they started cutting rates when this"
"2797330","2799690"," roll here and inflation took place."
"2801030","2804770"," Now, right now we have that same instance of inflation rolling over."
"2805330","2807810"," And I'm going to show you this on the actual charts this morning. "
"2808970","2815410"," And you can also see the Fed fund of fund rates coming up to a point where they could have"
"2816170","2817070"," to start to cut."
"2817550","2821890"," And I'm going to show you later on why they're going to have to cut, why the implication they have"
"2821890","2822210"," to cut."
"2822810","2829110"," If they don't cut now, right, if they don't, if they don't pivot now and they hold into 2023 into"
"2829110","2835430"," possibly 2024, we could do some irreparable, not irreparable, but some serious damage to the"
"2835430","2838010"," economy, some serious damage to the stock market. "
"2839610","2841590"," Here's why I just agree that the Fed will be published."
"2841590","2845850"," The unemployment rate has not been rising with the drop in inflation and raising of rates."
"2846170","2851390"," You want to see the unemployment rate going up with both of those, okay, and that has not happened. "
"2851890","2856330"," This will force Drew and Powell to have a Volcker moment and stay the course with policy until"
"2856330","2859050"," unemployment begins to rise in a meaningful way."
"2859590","2864890"," The truth is, until the Fed punishes the working class with high unemployment, the stock market"
"2864890","2866730"," will not begin a new bull cycle."
"2867610","2872810"," As low as the unemployment rate, you can see the Fed is waiting for it to rise or will need"
"2872810","2878470"," to shock it into rising, okay, I want you to see this, this unemployment rate down here, and the"
"2878470","2883850"," fact that the unemployment rate is not coming up with inflation rolling over with the leverage from"
"2883850","2887610"," the Fed's Fed fund rate means it needs to be shocked. "
"2888210","2889410"," How do you shock it is the question."
"2889410","2891630"," There's two ways to shock it."
"2891930","2901550"," That would be an unannounced rate increase on Wednesday, 75 DPS shows that the Fed is serious and"
"2901550","2906830"," could possibly jumpstart some kind of response from the unemployment rate. "
"2907800","2913510"," Now if they don't choose to do that, right, if they choose not to do the 75 DPS,"
"2914110","2923850"," they could show you in the charts with the algorithm what it shows"
"2923850","2924470"," will happen."
"2925410","2933550"," The idea would be we would trade sideways and be looking sideways and down, waiting for that moment"
"2933550","2936370"," where they actually cut rates and unemployment comes up."
"2936810","2941470"," You would see the market have one last capitulation move. "
"2941910","2946890"," Now if you, let's say right now you got that capitulation move right now, right, the destruction"
"2946890","2950210"," might only go down to let's say 3,200 or 3,100."
"2951230","2959210"," If they wait and stay the course into 2023 into 2024, if you see us start trading down and below"
"2959210","2964870"," the weekly moving average, we start having targets much lower than 3,100, 3,200."
"2965150","2972550"," We actually started having targets down 2,400s, 1,600, stuff like that, and you would also see the"
"2972550","2981390"," unemployment rate begin to rise into 2023 and then maybe possibly into the end of 2024 with rapid"
"2981390","2983910"," deceleration of inflation. "
"2985050","2987570"," Here's a minute clear that the Fed plans on a soft landing."
"2987890","2988570"," That's key too."
"2988990","2992070"," It's a key thing to consider going into Wednesday. "
"2992870","2999150"," His idea of a soft landing, this is why he's in a box right now, the idea of soft landing"
"2999150","3001730"," is about 3,200 to 3,100."
"3002250","3007570"," That is what their people are trying to tell you in social media and being forced into a corner."
"3008090","3017210"," For that soft landing to happen, right, they cannot not pivot into late next year, into the end of"
"3017210","3017850"," 2023. "
"3017950","3018730"," It's just not possible."
"3019590","3022030"," It's not possible in any way, shape, or form."
"3022550","3024190"," So what are they faced with?"
"3024190","3029810"," They're faced with trying to jumpstart unemployment or unemployment rates going up, right, with the"
"3029810","3038490"," 75 BPS rate hike or there's option B, and that is where they will pivot right now in attempt to"
"3038490","3045730"," dump the market and trigger unemployment going up at this point, okay, like a jumpstart of the"
"3045730","3046050"," market. "
"3046870","3051570"," So the Fed plan B is if at any point the Fed cuts rates, it will trigger a capitulation moment."
"3052730","3058970"," Plunging the market to lows of 3,100 to 3,200 and triggering unemployment to skyrocket, also"
"3058970","3060050"," leading to a new bull run."
"3060590","3063050"," The only question left is do they rip the Band-Aid off?"
"3063670","3068010"," That's what you want to know this week is do they rip the Band-Aid off, right, and try to"
"3068010","3072910"," jumpstart the economy or do they stay the course in a 2024?"
"3073270","3078610"," If they do, right, so if they don't rip the Band-Aid off, right, a sideways and down market with"
"3078610","3084270"," a couple of early year and late year attempts to crash the market, to much lower lows than 3,100"
"3084270","3087170"," as the economy collapses and the Fed finally cuts rates. "
"3087710","3091850"," So what you would see if you follow my cursor here, if they don't, if they stay the course, right,"
"3092510","3099130"," you're going to see the market want to roll down into 2023 and 2024, you'll see multiple attempts"
"3099130","3107090"," in early 2023 and then a final attempt in 2024 once they stopped, not just pause but pivot and you"
"3107090","3111630"," would see that capitulation move and that you'd actually start seeing some lower numbers, you'd be"
"3111630","3116310"," starting to target like 2,800, 2,600, 2,400 at minimum."
"3116710","3121270"," If you do that much damage at that point, in as a matter of fact, just so you know, if"
"3121270","3126570"," you cross over this weekly moving average here, that's when you start to get, if you go back down"
"3126570","3131350"," under the weekly moving average and start to cross below it, oh, and historically at least in our"
"3131350","3137830"," stock market, that's when you start seeing moments like 2000, 2001, 2007, 2008."
"3139850","3143870"," It's not pretty is it, and this is why many think that the Fed will cut rates now rather than"
"3143870","3147350"," later, rather than risk severe economic damage. "
"3147670","3148130"," Where do I stand?"
"3148350","3148790"," I don't."
"3149130","3152010"," The reaction trade is the best trade here heading into Wednesday."
"3152590","3156850"," This meeting will determine if we rip the Band-Aid off and only revisit the weekly moving average,"
"3156850","3161810"," maybe slightly lower, or the economy in the market has a meltdown by early, I should have written,"
"3162250","3169410"," or early, yeah, or at least by early 2024, you'll get a couple attempts in 2020, early 2024, and"
"3169410","3176270"," then more than likely a last attempt at the end of 2024, November, I expect of rates in the past"
"3176270","3176850"," stay the same. "
"3177230","3181490"," There may be an initial volcrush pump, Band-Aid trade leading to the market reversal into OPEX,"
"3181690","3184990"," then a chance after OPEX straight iron, if a low can be found on breadth."
"3184990","3188890"," For now, I'm bearish in the market, though, and I always trade the levels even if they go up."
"3189130","3193850"," Best regards, Captain Jim James, and I just talked to you about what to be expecting in the coming"
"3193850","3194390"," weeks here. "
"3195010","3196170"," I'm going to close that out for you."
"3197670","3199070"," Made that nice and quick and easy."
"3199330","3202610"," I'm going to show you in the charts what I'm talking about this morning, okay?"
"3204990","3209230"," I think under most circumstances, so let's look at this for a moment, okay?"
"3210110","3212930"," If you get a, hold on a second, I got a sneeze. "
"3215630","3221990"," If you get, let's say we go into the sepharum seaming, right, and you get a fed pivot, like a"
"3221990","3225290"," legit pivot, because they're being pushed into a corner, okay?"
"3225870","3228070"," They're lying, I want you to know that they're lying to you."
"3228090","3230570"," I know for 100% fact that they're lying to you."
"3231110","3236970"," So if, let's say they do a pivot, they could do this where they say, look, we'll try to do"
"3236970","3242450"," the pivot, hopefully we get a capitulation move, we blast down, right?"
"3243390","3248830"," If you get, if you get the pivot move, you get a capitulation move, you could, you, let's say even"
"3248830","3254490"," if we go up, let's say we go up to like 430, you'll still get a capitulation move, market should,"
"3254850","3258010"," should capitulate, blast down, right?"
"3259730","3266250"," And it could, it could jumpstart a turn in unemployment, you would end up seeing companies coming"
"3266250","3272190"," out and saying, you know, if we just blast down a third, a 3200, you can start seeing doom and"
"3272190","3272590"," gloom everywhere. "
"3273730","3279190"," They would then monitor to see if unemployment continues to come higher."
"3279610","3285470"," They could even come back later on and put rates back onto the market, believe it or not, as that"
"3285470","3291130"," unemployment rate gets jump started, and then you start to see unemployment continue to rise in"
"3291130","3292750"," 2023, 2024, 2024."
"3293330","3297970"," The second thing they could do is they hit you with the 75 DPS, it tells the market that they're"
"3297970","3304490"," serious, tells you, tells the market that they're staying the course until we meet these certain"
"3304490","3307490"," economic conditions on the outside of the market. "
"3308350","3312430"," Now, if we have that, you still see some kind of a capitulation move and move higher likely."
"3312910","3320310"," The market can easily, and I can show you this historically, can easily go up when the Fed is"
"3320310","3321010"," applying rates."
"3321010","3329630"," If the market feels as though the Fed, the Treasury Department is taking this seriously, the market"
"3329630","3332230"," will move up as unemployment starts to rise. "
"3333090","3339990"," So that the 75 DPS might be the best solution to save the market at this point, believe it or"
"3339990","3340210"," not."
"3340970","3346470"," Now, if the Fed stays the course and says to you, yeah, we're going to do the 50 DPS, yeah,"
"3347150","3352870"," we're going to get into the terminal rate by early springtime, we'll pause and monitor and apply"
"3352870","3354010"," more if we need to."
"3354970","3361710"," You might not see the market come up until, until they see that the Fed is serious, right?"
"3363070","3370070"," Now even if they do say that, that means they haven't broken anything, but you have to understand"
"3370070","3375550"," that we're going to begin to trade sideways and look for that capitulation moment, so you could see"
"3375550","3377490"," more damage as we get into next year. "
"3384220","3385280"," Let's see what you guys are saying here."
"3388620","3395320"," Whenever we ever had a soft landing after a bump, and when have we ever had a soft landing after"
"3395320","3397020"," a 5% bump in inflation?"
"3397300","3399940"," I can show you guys exactly when we've gone up."
"3400340","3401880"," If you want to see, I'll show you right now. "
"3402920","3405220"," Give me just a second here and I'll bring some stuff up for you."
"3405340","3409220"," Now there are some contrarian indicators going on in the stock market right now."
"3409760","3417360"," Believe it or not, we'll look at a couple places, okay, I'm going to show you a couple places real"
"3417360","3417600"," quick. "
"3419990","3429920"," Just a second here, let's talk about some contrarian indicators, okay, I want you to see right if"
"3429920","3435680"," you're a bull out there, this is a daily chart on just the spy, okay, you're going to be looking"
"3435680","3440580"," for, you don't want to be buying the market right right now, do you?"
"3441980","3449700"," You can see that we still have not lost market breadth at this point, but it is telling that we're"
"3449700","3453580"," close to losing market breadth and we're not down here on the charts just yet, are we?"
"3454020","3461160"," So this is implying that we are accumulating down here, okay, I want you to be aware of that, that"
"3461160","3466440"," market capitulation is showing a higher low in the market currently."
"3467300","3473380"," Same thing over here, right, with the PPO, the bulls are looking for a signal here that we"
"3473380","3479640"," capitulate and that we actually start to begin to reverse on the PPO."
"3480020","3485440"," Now there is a negative here, the momentum indicator is showing a crossover that took place, yes, I"
"3485440","3488080"," believe it was Friday, finally took place. "
"3489000","3495520"," These are typically on a daily chart, very bad, not good at all watching these now."
"3495520","3501720"," I want to take your attention though to something else underneath the market, if you begin to look"
"3501720","3506920"," on a weekly chart on these indicators, they're telling a slightly different story."
"3508740","3513800"," Down here they're showing some more capitulation needed on a weekly basis, but you're watching, if"
"3513800","3521040"," you're going back in time, right, I want you to see here, this PPO is starting to show right, some"
"3521040","3528500"," major, major, major buying of this market underneath, okay, I want you to look at this PMO down"
"3528500","3534080"," below as well, that's trying to fight rather than reverse course over here. "
"3534560","3546070"," Now I'm going to show you in a monthly chart that underneath the market, okay, which is, there's"
"3546070","3551070"," still some room to go down here right now, so we're not talking about price here, what we're"
"3551070","3556930"," talking about is that there's some kind of a bottom coming, okay, there's some kind of a bottom"
"3556930","3562530"," coming in the market, it's going to happen soon, I don't know if it's this week, I don't know that"
"3562530","3571370"," if it's January or March or if it's even possibly until late to next year, but these indicators are"
"3571370","3577410"," telling you on a higher time frame that we're near some kind of a bottom, so if you're a bull"
"3577410","3583210"," or a bear it doesn't matter, if you want to protect your money, we'll talk about that on a, hold"
"3583210","3590720"," on a second here, I don't want to say I'm going to go back to the day, I'm going to"
"3590720","3601000"," show you on a regular chart here, I'm going to turn some of these off, I'm"
"3601000","3605740"," going to just keep it real simple for you, okay, you know that there's some accumulation going on"
"3605740","3615720"," down here, you know that there's an idea, if you have cash to deploy that"
"3615720","3621560"," you're buying this bottom here, you're more than likely looking to buy a bottom sometime in 2023"
"3621560","3631200"," and possibly even late in 2023, 2024, so your dollar cost averaging to not miss when this"
"3631200","3639960"," happens, okay, just a macro view, if you're looking to buy this market, there was or a chance to"
"3639960","3645040"," buy it here, if you didn't buy anything here, you're more than likely going to see something coming"
"3645040","3652880"," up, either this week into January, March, you should see attempts down here to begin to start to re "
"3652880","3658060","-enter the market, you know you start off at 10, 15% then you add 20% at a lower"
"3658060","3663680"," low and then you add another 10, 20% at a lower low and have some cash in hand, 30,"
"3663740","3671740"," 40% for that turn, whenever it happens here, okay, now I'm gonna show at least, let me go to"
"3671740","3680860"," SPX, just sitting here, SPX, all right, we're gonna look at SPX here, here's the good one for you,"
"3681380","3687660"," we're gonna do some, you guys get your, you guys get your trading view apps up, if you're at home"
"3687660","3692740"," right now, go break open trading view on a computer or a laptop or something, get your phone out"
"3692740","3701980"," and what are we gonna start with, we'll start with the Fed fund rate, this is the effective Fed"
"3701980","3708820"," funds rate right here, you can just compare, assemble, go to SPX, Fed funds rate, just do a new,"
"3708960","3716380"," new pain right here and then you'll do an inflation as a percentage right, you get an inflation"
"3716380","3725120"," rate right here, you're over here inflation rate, USIRY to a new pain there and then you'll do the"
"3725120","3733700"," unemployment rate right here, you can just type them in and we'll start looking at these, matter of"
"3733700","3743680"," fact we'll go one by one, I did the Fed funds rate first, right, yeah we'll just start with"
"3743680","3753340"," the first one, okay and inflation as a percentage, I'll put that back on there,"
"3756250","3766110"," do you pay, okay we'll just look at inflation back in history and we'll"
"3766110","3774440"," come over to some key points okay, I want you to, I want you to see this, I want you"
"3774440","3779580"," to look, follow my cursor down here, this blue line right do you, I want you to see that, so"
"3779580","3784760"," you see the curling over here of inflation right, see that curling over inflation is coming down,"
"3785220","3790820"," this is why it doesn't matter what the CPI print says, I want you to see that okay, inflation is"
"3790820","3795060"," coming down, anyone that's telling you that inflation is not coming down, they don't know what"
"3795060","3799760"," they're talking about, at least the rates that they use, inflation is coming down, you're also"
"3799760","3809240"," watching the Fed rates increase still right, and I want you to see back here in past instances when"
"3809240","3819220"," inflation has rolled over right that you've seen, remember these two"
"3819220","3830920"," instances right here okay, I want you to see that the Fed will typically pivot here, okay"
"3830920","3838880"," I'm sorry, I want you to see that the Fed, so this is the inflation rolling over right, and the"
"3838880","3848800"," Fed will typically be forced to pivot and they pivot rapidly okay, I want you to see that, we'll"
"3848800","3854380"," talk about the vocal moment later, we'll talk about Paul Volcker moments later, but you can see"
"3854380","3864240"," historically this is what happens you can see it in history as well, if they start to cut"
"3864240","3869900"," rates right, you can see it right here, they start to cut rates, same thing right here, begin to"
"3869900","3877400"," cut rates okay, I want you to be aware of that, just looking at inflation, and they know from"
"3877400","3886460"," previous examples because of the Fed rates going higher that they should expect a rapid inflation,"
"3886800","3897530"," or inflation going down right, rapidly just a second here, we're going to look at one last one, I'm"
"3897530","3903590"," going to bring up, we're going to bring up over here, this is the unemployment rate, this is the"
"3903590","3908670"," one that pisses people up, this is the one that pissed me off when I was watching Yellen yesterday,"
"3909550","3919910"," because they know this, okay, you see down here this rapid rise and inflation or unemployment, look"
"3919910","3928470"," at how fast that is, you see that, but we're not quite seeing that, that rise yet are we, we're"
"3928470","3935090"," not quite seeing it down here, you're not seeing, you should be, what you should be seeing right"
"3935090","3940390"," now, if they were like today, what you really want to be seeing is you really want to be seeing"
"3940390","3948550"," this up, like this high, this should be bottom in the market, this would indicate a bottom in the"
"3948550","3955250"," market, you want to see this, you want to see these three compared, these three compared and"
"3955250","3962090"," looking just like this, if you're looking for a bull run generally, not generally, historically,"
"3962770","3968110"," since the beginning of the stock market, you're looking for something like a bottom with"
"3968110","3975750"," unemployment being high, with a rollover and inflation and with some kind of max rates going on, do"
"3975750","3982330"," you see what I'm saying here, and we're not seeing that right now are we, this is an abnormality in"
"3982330","3987390"," unemployment, and we're going to look at a couple of plays, I think in the money talked about this,"
"3987870","3992250"," so if I'm stealing any as thunder or anything like that, I'm going to give him all the credit, so"
"3992250","4000670"," please check him out, check out his channel, guys amazing, look up to him, 100%, so let's look at,"
"4000670","4010080"," this is what, 1993, and I was actually looking at this one down here,"
"4010700","4017000"," I was looking at this moment in 1980, this kind of looks kind of similar, this is not a weekly"
"4017000","4031350"," or monthly, let's look at a, let's look at a weekly and see if that proves, this is 08, we"
"4031350","4039290"," just can give a better idea for you, and when you see these rates get cut right here, right, this"
"4039290","4045530"," is the rate being cut, and there's one more plunge down, you see this one more plunge, it cut"
"4045530","4053750"," rates, boom, we plunge down, ramp up of unemployment, right, and then we trigger a run, does that"
"4053750","4061270"," make sense, I want you to see that, right, you see inflation, it's actually peak, inflation might"
"4061270","4068030"," come back up, and it'll slowly come down, you actually see the market move higher, I'm going to"
"4068030","4074370"," show you it again over here, as it took place, see if I can get the scale to show it,"
"4076210","4083770"," not softer landing in here, right, in 1980, see that softer landing, but we did trade higher prior"
"4083770","4089430"," to, this is because we raised rates so high that the stock market believed that the Fed was taking"
"4089430","4095770"," the internals, the damage that's taking place underneath the hood, we traded kind of sideways and"
"4095770","4101850"," up, we only had that one capitulation moment, we had a rise in unemployment, when you don't see"
"4101850","4106830"," that rise in unemployment, that means there's something wrong, right, so when you start to see that"
"4106830","4112310"," the rates are going up, right, you're seeing inflation rising, but you're seeing that the Fed is"
"4112310","4118910"," serious here, right, that's the key, does the market believe the Fed is fighting, inflation, and"
"4118910","4123430"," we're not seeing that right now in our current market, I want you to know that, so how do you"
"4123430","4131689"," jumpstart that, how do you jumpstart that right now in our market and where we are, so today, or"
"4131689","4138670"," Wednesday, you're going to be looking for the Fed to have some kind of a capitulation moment to the"
"4138670","4149630"," market, either by the market taking the Fed seriously, right, maybe a rate shock, or"
"4149630","4155609"," being forced into that, into the back of that corner to pivot, and if they pivot, you'll still see"
"4155609","4161189"," that capitulation moment down in the stock market, you'll see it, right, a blast down quickly"
"4161189","4167270"," instead of waiting, you know, so we start to go lower and lower into 2024, you end up seeing a"
"4167270","4173229"," capitulation move in the market, and that hopefully triggers this unemployment number to come up"
"4174250","4178870"," into 2023, it means that the Fed is serious, right, you'd see strong language, the Fed will be"
"4178870","4183090"," serious, you might see, you might see a little bit of inflation coming back, but you want to see"
"4183090","4190290"," inflation coming down, and if they crank it up, right, this could be like a catastrophic in the"
"4190290","4195450"," news, and your view, you'd see it as catastrophic, it'd be presented as catastrophic, but the"
"4195450","4201370"," reality is, for us as traders, us as investors, we're actually looking for that move and for this"
"4201370","4207490"," rate to move higher, so that once they do cut the plug on the fund, federal funds rate, you've got"
"4207490","4211590"," unemployment high, you've got inflation coming down, you know you can buy that bottom, we're off"
"4211590","4214270"," and running again in the stock market, does that make sense?"
"4215830","4216710"," Everybody tracking that?"
"4217110","4220450"," If they come out today, right, and they try, I'm telling you, they come out on Wednesday, they come"
"4220450","4223590"," out on Wednesday, and they try to tell you, they're going to stay at the course, I don't know,"
"4223730","4229250"," maybe we do get a, we could possibly get a quick reaction up, you know, we have the Vanarelli, they"
"4229250","4235030"," tell you we're going to 430 or some nonsense like that, but I don't think that's real, I think that"
"4235030","4240770"," you're going to end up seeing sideways and down, man, until they do, sideways and down until you"
"4240770","4246730"," see that capitulation move in the market, the longer we wait for that capitulation move, the more"
"4246730","4252830"," we start beginning to trade sideways and down, and we start to really do damage, right, the longer"
"4252830","4257690"," that it takes, the deeper that we're going to go in that capitulation move down the road."
"4259750","4264650"," Let me get rid of this for you real quick, let me just, let me bring this down, getting my"
"4264650","4268330"," bear, I'm getting my, I'm getting all bearish, I bet all the bulls are listening this morning,"
"4268450","4276370"," they're like, let the f is he's saying, I bet the bulls out there are like, he's gone, he's, he's"
"4276370","4288210"," a trader, I'm not a trader, I don't"
"4288210","4294110"," care about tax loss harvesting right now, and you shouldn't either, it means nothing, in the, in"
"4294110","4301230"," the, in the grand scheme of the world right now, I'm telling you, the tax loss harvesting is means"
"4301230","4308750"," absolutely nothing to this market right now, it's zero, it means zero, the, the, the, the market"
"4308750","4315570"," has to either believe that the Fed is fighting inflation plus, but they, they, they kind of do"
"4315570","4320700"," think that the, I think that the market believes that the Fed is fighting inflation, it's all in"
"4320700","4322800"," unemployment now."
"4324420","4328440"," How many times have we had conversations in this channel?"
"4329280","4338240"," I mean, tell me, you tell me in the chat, how many times I've told you, how many times have"
"4338240","4348610"," I said to you that until Joe the mechanic has lost his job, has"
"4348610","4357030"," lost his wife, has lost his kids, has lost his $140,000 truck, has lost to everything, and you know"
"4357030","4363430"," Joe, like he's, he's guy you know, right, I don't care if he's a mechanic, I don't care if it's"
"4363430","4368650"," a, a mary, I don't care who it is, I told you, I told you in the stream a hundred"
"4368650","4375410"," times, until you see that right, I don't want to hear about a market crash, you give what I'm"
"4375410","4380610"," saying, and we'll, we'll get that market crash when you see that, right, you're going to, you know"
"4380610","4385090"," what, you want to see blood in the streets, you want to see that capitulation move, you want to see"
"4385090","4390690"," the unemployment rate rise, you have to, and the Fed has to trigger it, and I don't know how they"
"4390690","4391190"," trigger it. "
"4392010","4399690"," If not, maybe the 75 BPS could send the stock market up, and if it does, you'll still down the"
"4399690","4407310"," road see Joe mechanic lose all this shit, even though the stock market's going up, that's where the"
"4407310","4409850"," separation in the stock market and the economy comes in."
"4410950","4411790"," Does that make sense?"
"4412530","4416310"," So if the, so if the stock market believes that the Fed's fighting it, even if they're not, even if"
"4416310","4420050"," they're not actually fighting it, they're just buying time, but they're, they're doing something,"
"4420450","4425010"," you might actually see the stock market go up, but that that's the truth."
"4425430","4431650"," That's what Yellen was saying yesterday, in her interview, which was disgusting, because if she had"
"4431650","4440030"," told the truth to the interviewer, or if the interviewer probably knew this as well, and the fact"
"4440030","4447830"," that they weren't truthful to most people that don't have any idea of how this will impact them and"
"4447830","4451230"," their regular lives, it's kind of gross and disgusting, it's kind of dirty. "
"4453110","4454330"," Do you guys get what I'm saying?"
"4455110","4457190"," So how do you trade this into Wednesday, right?"
"4457350","4462450"," You should be coming back in this video, writing all this stuff down and trade a reaction off of"
"4462450","4464790"," whatever the rate announcement is."
"4470970","4472470"," Yeah, I don't care what any of that stuff."
"4474030","4479070"," I guarantee you that the stock market can go up, 100% the stock market can go up. "
"4479750","4485670"," The US economy, the US does not care about what's happening in the rest of the world."
"4486330","4487470"," I don't know if you know that."
"4487570","4490730"," I know you think that we're tied into the world economy, but we are not. "
"4493110","4497150"," Our stock market gives a rat's ass about the rest of the world."
"4497590","4499190"," It doesn't care."
"4501170","4505230"," This is your first time hearing it. "
"4505710","4507070"," So that's what that's what you need to know."
"4508090","4510570"," You can always pause this video, go back and watch that stuff."
"4510830","4514890"," I posted the link up on that PDF hosting site. "
"4515270","4516950"," You should get a copy of it today."
"4517550","4522070"," I will have one emailed to you by the time I go to bed tonight."
"4523350","4524830"," So you have some access to it. "
"4525990","4529150"," And you should trade the reaction off whatever their rate decision is today."
"4529250","4529650"," It's a key."
"4530290","4531530"," This is a very important week. "
"4532210","4534750"," This is this is why I don't believe that CPI matters."
"4535410","4542890"," This is why I tone to what the Fed does on Wednesday."
"4543550","4551790"," It is probably the most important decision of the year to know what's taking place sooner than"
"4551790","4553290"," later or later than later. "
"4555110","4557870"," It's pretty much setting the tone for 2024."
"4566310","4570210"," You know, so I just gave you the bear the bear."
"4570670","4579170"," So the longer that they the longer that the Fed maintains the course that they are on 50 BPS"
"4579170","4583650"," terminal rate coming in this late winter early spring, right?"
"4584190","4585050"," And then a pause. "
"4585670","4594110"," The longer they take into 2023 and 2024, the more damage will be done with a big bull or big"
"4594110","4599170"," bear collapse or not collapsed, but the big like we're going to 1600."
"4599930","4604390"," The longer they take, the more damage is going to be done."
"4605330","4605590"," Absolutely. "
"4606630","4608110"," It'll be the slow bleed out."
"4608290","4610350"," And I think that's part of what Elon was saying."
"4610970","4613030"," So it is trying to protect his company. "
"4613470","4619850"," You can so whether you guys can parse or understand what Elon was saying in his tweets about the"
"4619850","4627670"," Fed should pivot as if I was Elon or any CEO, I would be trying to protect my company from"
"4627670","4628270"," going bankrupt."
"4628830","4630710"," That would mean a Fed pivot."
"4631130","4638010"," If the Fed does not pivot and chooses, you know, Elon should have said 75 BPS because that would"
"4638010","4638890"," have done the same thing. "
"4639390","4642950"," He has that I was a little upset that he wasn't more specific."
"4643430","4649170"," If he had said 75 BPS or a pivot, that would have been the smart tweet from him."
"4649910","4653030"," Him saying just the pivot was not enough. "
"4653210","4660690"," Like anybody saying that because he knows that if the Fed drags this out, if they drag the economy"
"4660690","4666250"," in the market out for another year, you will see real destruction."
"4666550","4670690"," You will see not just the middle class and the poor get destroyed."
"4670910","4673430"," You'll see companies in America start to get destroyed. "
"4674330","4674970"," 100%."
"4674970","4676010"," Almost guaranteed."
"4677090","4678270"," Almost almost guaranteed. "
"4678550","4680030"," Historically, almost guaranteed."
"4680910","4686390"," You'll have an event just like 2000, 2001, 2007, 2008."
"4686710","4688310"," So very critical meeting on Wednesday. "
"4689110","4691610"," I don't know if everyone knows the importance of the meeting on Wednesday."
"4692230","4694370"," I don't think that you need to capture the entire trade."
"4695170","4699450"," If it goes down, there will be plenty of room to go down because no need. "
"4699630","4703670"," Well, I guess you can, there's traders out there that like to trade both sides."
"4704310","4705850"," For me, I don't need to."
"4706970","4709110"," I'd rather trade the reaction to trade it down. "
"4709670","4712770"," I'd rather trade the reaction to buy that bottom when it happens."
"4714350","4715850"," There's plenty of time in that trade."
"4723190","4725630"," Yeah, but the housing market can become stabilized. "
"4727030","4729030"," It's the people with bad debt."
"4729230","4732030"," You guys have to understand that this has more to do with people with bad debt."
"4733810","4734990"," Shaking those people out. "
"4741550","4747870"," No, I mean, no, I know that argument with labor force participation rate."
"4748090","4748750"," I understand that argument."
"4750970","4752350"," This is hammer and nail. "
"4752950","4753850"," Hammer and nail."
"4756210","4757150"," Hammer and nail."
"4757430","4758830"," It's all about hammer and nail. "
"4759250","4760310"," It's a blunt instrument."
"4766200","4775960"," I think you guys are definitely trying to mix two things that don't mix"
"4775960","4778700"," well, which is the economy and the stock market."
"4779040","4781140"," You guys have to look at this. "
"4781320","4784660"," If you're tuning into me, I'm assuming that you're an investor."
"4785260","4793620"," I'm assuming that you're a short seller, a long equity buyer, you're a trader of some kind out"
"4793620","4793840"," there."
"4795220","4799320"," There are times to include the economy and into your market decisions. "
"4800220","4804980"," There are times to understand how the impact where the market is going to go."
"4805440","4808640"," They oftentimes do not intersect."
"4810120","4815020"," Usually, people get caught on the wrong side of a hammer and nail from the Fed. "
"4817980","4823040"," You guys have to understand there's a big difference in how the stock market trades versus how the"
"4823040","4828160"," economy is and what the Fed and the Treasury is trying to accomplish."
"4833470","4836550"," I got to warn you guys out there."
"4836930","4839590"," You got to put your blunt as an equity trader, right?"
"4840370","4841950"," You have to put your blinders on. "
"4842330","4848170"," As a matter of fact, the bond market, I heard some guy telling me that the bond market isn't quite"
"4848170","4848470"," sure."
"4848530","4857090"," The bond market is definitely trading to the Fed sticking with their path right now."
"4857890","4858450"," Definitely. "
"4859110","4862090"," Or it's set up for that possibility, I should say."
"4864600","4865160"," Definitely."
"4868480","4869660"," Did you copy on that, Troy?"
"4872400","4873060"," Right on. "
"4873340","4874460"," I think I'm clear on that."
"4875080","4883960"," You guys, so the last time Jerome Powell spoke, I knew and what he was saying was, we're going to"
"4883960","4888120"," pivot or there's a chance we pivot and the market went up on that."
"4889900","4893660"," If there's a pivot, you could see a two week, this is the other side of a two. "
"4894080","4899420"," If you see a pivot, it's possible that the market's initial reaction is we're getting out of this."
"4900180","4905220"," You could, you could, you could make that argument that the market could scream higher for like two"
"4905220","4905460"," weeks."
"4906040","4907720"," The market could scream higher for three days. "
"4908260","4911980"," They could be telling you in the news, it's all over, we're going up."
"4913000","4914080"," And all it is is a trap."
"4915040","4919720"," If you're not actually getting a 430, more than likely they'll just roll it right back down and"
"4919720","4921020"," they'll slam down on 3,200. "
"4921740","4923220"," This is a pretty good place to do it at."
"4923560","4929560"," I mean, if we were at like 410, 420, and they dropped it, you really got to understand, we're at"
"4929560","4932720"," like 410, 420, and they dropped it down to 3,200."
"4933580","4934560"," No one's hedged. "
"4934920","4938820"," Everyone's out or the long, long only people are all off sides."
"4939800","4943340"," There'd be no time to get them back on sides, right, to get protection."
"4944260","4945740"," There'd be no, there'd be no hedging going on. "
"4946240","4951660"," The bears would believe, believe it or not, that we're not going back down and they wouldn't be"
"4951660","4956520"," short and they wouldn't be holding puts and you'd literally catch the entire market off sides."
"4957580","4964300"," Well, not the entire market, you probably catch like 80% of the market off sides, 80%, 90% of"
"4964300","4964700"," the off sides."
"4964940","4971380"," You'd have people removing shorts in the market, maybe bears not buying puts to be inundated with"
"4971380","4980460"," news that were going up and then boom, there would go like 420, go down a thousand points and any"
"4980460","4983640"," of the crazy part is we didn't break the stock market. "
"4984080","4988900"," We didn't break everything and the stock market's been saved."
"4989360","4994560"," It's brief, it's painful, they ripped the band-aid off and we're down at 3,200, we're not down at"
"4994560","4996320"," 2,400, 1,600 mark."
"4996940","5002920"," That's like a chance that they will attempt to do that in this meeting or maybe even the next"
"5002920","5003240"," meeting. "
"5004300","5008260"," Then I'll do it today or this week but I'm telling you, they're either going to rip the band-aid"
"5008260","5017740"," off the next couple of fed rate decisions and if they don't, we're facing real danger, real danger"
"5017740","5020180"," in the economy, real danger in the stock market."
"5024180","5024700"," Good."
"5026340","5029060"," Tough week is saying the VIX is climbing. "
"5029680","5035900"," It should, we should enter volatility today at some point, it should continue to grow into the CPR"
"5035900","5041540"," report and then also into into the event itself."
"5042600","5047000"," It's a good thing to be, it's a good thing to be along the VIX and then, of course, if"
"5047000","5050640"," you're going to be along the VIX or if you're going to be long on a hedge, like a call"
"5050640","5055320"," or like a inverse ETF, remember to take your money and run."
"5056800","5063060"," Remember how like new VIX traders are always like, UVXY, buy the UVXY, don't be buying calls and"
"5063060","5063200"," puts. "
"5064200","5068060"," Make sure that you're capturing that profit as we head into Tuesday and Wednesday."
"5068840","5071240"," You'll see a re-pricing, right?"
"5071440","5074740"," Event ball, let me see if I can find my event ball stuff here."
"5075200","5078940"," I thought I posted an SPX event ball. "
"5079620","5080940"," Let me see if I got it in here somewhere."
"5082180","5084920"," I'll show you guys this real quick if I have it."
"5084940","5088560"," I don't know if I have it here, but let me see if I do. "
"5093500","5096000"," Okay, I got all kinds of stuff for you guys today."
"5096320","5097240"," It doesn't mean fun times."
"5100640","5105860"," Okay, this might be, this probably isn't today, but it serves its purpose. "
"5107460","5113840"," It gets updated every day, this is not an updated copy, but it serves its purpose, okay?"
"5114960","5118700"," And we're going to go over a implied volatility."
"5119520","5121940"," Now, it's probably higher today, but that doesn't matter, okay?"
"5122140","5122840"," This is what matters."
"5124160","5126180"," No matter what, no, not no matter what. "
"5126300","5130320"," Most circumstances, if you follow my cursor, this is the event ball, okay?"
"5131380","5133700"," You'll see a crush on this after the event."
"5133860","5135900"," See the dates down here, six days, eight days."
"5136820","5141700"," I want you to see that the volatility comes off, but it's still elevated down here, okay?"
"5142660","5144120"," This is still elevated volatility. "
"5145320","5150220"," You can, if you're going to trade, let's say we get the, let's say we get crushed right on the"
"5150220","5153240"," event volatility, and we don't have a crash immediately."
"5154340","5159640"," You want to be looking, I'll get to the, today's implied volatility, and you can track these and"
"5159640","5161140"," see if it's going up or down."
"5161700","5166920"," These things don't matter down the road, like don't ever be looking at the down the term structure"
"5166920","5167320"," road. "
"5167540","5168780"," They don't know what's going to happen."
"5168820","5169440"," I promise you that."
"5169720","5173660"," You'll have people out there in the social media trying to tell you, oh, yeah, it's doom and gloom"
"5173660","5176480"," for the next, you know, five years or something. "
"5176600","5177680"," Don't be looking at down here."
"5178020","5179040"," Right here is what matters."
"5179960","5180620"," Hey, buddy. "
"5181960","5189160"," What you want to be seeing is if puts are added down the road, 20 days, 30 days, three months"
"5189160","5189680"," down the road."
"5190000","5194900"," After the event, right, after Wednesday's event, you'll either see this come down or go up."
"5196060","5201300"," If it means that they don't think we're going to have continued down right into January, February,"
"5201700","5205560"," March, if you're a bull looking, thinking this is the bottom, if you're looking for puts coming off"
"5205560","5208940"," down here, right, or this or this volatility at least coming down. "
"5209340","5214500"," If this volatility starts to rise, that means that they don't believe any kind of pump that comes"
"5214500","5216840"," in after this crush over here in the left."
"5218120","5222980"," I'll do a class on that sometime on, on implied volatility."
"5224200","5225620"," Number one, it's not true. "
"5226140","5233340"," It's just a forecast and it also takes into account how well hedged the stock market is if they're"
"5233340","5234460"," not hedged in the stock market."
"5234820","5240160"," If they take hedges off or put hedges on, oftentimes, if you see a rip in the market and you"
"5240160","5241800"," reverse, and you go, why did it reverse?"
"5242440","5243920"," You can actually check the implied ball."
"5244520","5248740"," It'll give you an idea if we're going to get a marker reversal down the road two months, a month,"
"5249740","5250460"," three weeks down the road. "
"5260050","5261510"," Yeah, you guys have to look at it."
"5261610","5263470"," So Andre is saying, I'll settle for 3,200."
"5263670","5265410"," There'll be a lot of good deals to be picked up then. "
"5265850","5269330"," Yeah, you guys have to see that there's pretty much two paths."
"5269650","5272630"," We pretty much get a bottom around 32 to 3,100."
"5273510","5280990"," If the Fed is either, if the stock market believes that the Fed is serious, you'll see a bottom at"
"5280990","5281890"," 31 or 3,200. "
"5282210","5283130"," You'll see a retest."
"5283390","5285230"," I'll show you, I'll show you why about this retest."
"5285390","5285990"," You guys want to see it?"
"5286430","5287410"," I'll show you that right now. "
"5287410","5287990"," Hold on a second."
"5290330","5292430"," Let me see if I got a weekly moving average in here."
"5293910","5295970"," These are just simple things you guys can do. "
"5296050","5301790"," You don't really need to be rocket scientists when it comes to the stock market."
"5302550","5307070"," Oftentimes, you'll see people who try to complicate things for you as an investor, as a trader, and"
"5307070","5307570"," you really don't."
"5307650","5309510"," This is a weekly moving average, okay?"
"5310250","5311370"," Let's see this red line right here. "
"5312530","5316230"," This is a weekly moving average, and I'm going to show you, take all this away."
"5316350","5317610"," I'm going to show you what I'm talking about here, okay?"
"5319130","5324150"," There's another another another great layer for you to like simple things for you to be looking at."
"5326410","5327990"," Now we did bounce off it. "
"5329030","5333070"," Well, blast it through it and bounced off it in the COVID crash."
"5334030","5341050"," And we had we had we had unemployment blasted through the roof and actually we crashed right"
"5341050","5341670"," through here, right?"
"5341670","5343970"," Let me get rid of this right here for you, but I want to show you something."
"5345750","5347870"," We'll look at this on a weekly point. "
"5348250","5349330"," So we came down, right?"
"5349510","5352530"," We touched the weekly moving average briefly briefly broke through."
"5353070","5356750"," You'd really like to see if we're going to let's say they're saying, hey, you can have a"
"5356750","5357510"," capitulation moment."
"5357970","5360370"," And we could have a capitulation moment soon, right?"
"5361130","5364310"," Or we could have a capitulation moment later on in 2024. "
"5364830","5368430"," And we can already try to pause it that the longer we wait, the worse could get."
"5368950","5371550"," So let's say we get up a capitulation moment now."
"5372270","5376130"," You'd like to see some kind of a bounce off of the weekly moving average. "
"5376630","5378010"," You get the retest, right?"
"5378470","5380590"," And we can continue on if we believe the fed."
"5381190","5381730"," Does that make sense?"
"5382670","5384990"," Or if we're seeing unemployment rising, does that make sense?"
"5385190","5391670"," Even if we blast through briefly down here, let's say, okay, this is this is like right now, now"
"5391670","5395030"," into like January right now, okay?"
"5396050","5397590"," Now I'm going to show you what happens."
"5398570","5402270"," If this weekly moving average continues, right?"
"5403590","5405450"," And we we're still not believing the market. "
"5405450","5408730"," We begin to slip under the weekly moving average."
"5408730","5412950"," I'll show you exactly what happens when you slip under because it's not pretty."
"5413350","5417390"," And there's only a few times in history that we have slipped under. "
"5418370","5422250"," And what it I'll show you exactly what takes place once we slip under."
"5422810","5423930"," It's it's pretty nasty."
"5424930","5427050"," Okay, and so I'm going to show you that right now. "
"5428310","5430270"," So you can see it historically here."
"5431550","5433710"," You want to see the last time we slipped under it?"
"5434530","5435550"," Right here, no way."
"5436410","5439050"," We tested it, right?"
"5439570","5440710"," Did that bullshit we just did?"
"5441550","5445050"," We slipped under and you see the length of time it took here. "
"5446030","5448430"," And we started blasting down and we stayed down."
"5449110","5449630"," Does that make sense?"
"5450490","5452230"," I'm going to show you the next example in the past."
"5452470","5455010"," This is we can go right back to the beginning of the stock market with the stuff. "
"5455910","5460470"," When do you think last time was right here, no one, right?"
"5460690","5465550"," This time we blasted down, came back up, and we found that it was going to take longer than"
"5465550","5466550"," anticipated, right?"
"5467810","5473850"," And when once we broke under the second time, right, we came through, it came back up, we retested"
"5473850","5475830"," and failed, right?"
"5476110","5477030"," And that was it, right?"
"5477190","5478610"," Took longer than expected, right?"
"5479550","5481210"," The Fed, right?"
"5481730","5484030"," We're saying, oh, we're going to stay the course for another year, right?"
"5485250","5486470"," I'm going to see that."
"5486690","5491510"," And then I want you to see in previous examples, start going back in history, right?"
"5492070","5493030"," Touch and go, right?"
"5493410","5494170"," Touch and go."
"5494930","5496350"," This is 1990, right?"
"5497990","5499430"," Same back in here in 87. "
"5499770","5502030"," This is, this is when we had the algo crash, right?"
"5504070","5507070"," This is back in 1979, 1980, right?"
"5507370","5508070"," Retest and go."
"5508270","5508730"," Do you see that?"
"5509670","5513070"," Boom, down to it, boom, down to it, off and running."
"5515090","5519330"," Break below one more test, off and running. "
"5520370","5523110"," This is the jumpstart that they're trying to do right now."
"5524110","5528530"," They're trying to do some kind of a jumpstart here, and they have to do it for sooner than later."
"5530050","5530930"," Does that make sense to you?"
"5532110","5536890"," They don't want to, they don't want to break below and spend some time down here because we know"
"5536890","5538070"," where that winds up, right?"
"5538190","5542570"," We have previous examples of when it takes longer than expected, right?"
"5542910","5547650"," But there's more damage done, and there's more time for damage to be done to the stock market in"
"5547650","5548210"," our economy. "

"7855190","7858690"," This is a very, this market's got no vague right now. "
"7859710","7867090"," And you can actually see here that the sellers are stepping in, sending it back down."
"7867210","7868630"," You can actually see the volume is huge."
"7870070","7877790"," They've said publicly that they're not, they're not block selling in this in the days leading up"
"7877790","7878570"," and they surely are. "
"7879650","7884710"," Normally they're supposed to be doing it at the open in the closes, but they're not they're doing"
"7884710","7885490"," it right in the middle of the day."
"7890470","7895710"," Not 10,000, but a significant amount of people in the thousands."
"7899850","7903890"," I think that's partially the reason we're going to take it off or we're going to take some of this"
"7903890","7908930"," stuff off of at Captain's Alpha so that we know who we're actually sending stuff to. "
"7909390","7912490"," You want to make sure that there's a couple of things."
"7912990","7914570"," You can get the platform easily."
"7915110","7919850"," There's some changes coming to social media where there's there's a fight in the background. "
"7925710","7929930"," There's a fight going on in the background of social media where there's like a fight for control"
"7929930","7938090"," over content creators and then, uh, payments and stuff like that in the speech, of course, and"
"7938090","7941670"," then, um, hosting that content is the cost of it."
"7941730","7949610"," Two to 66, a new, a six month bill high yield, four got six, three percent."
"7950130","7953370"," We're trying to build this so it can be off site in case, the case is already kind of deep"
"7953370","7959710"," deep platforming or, um, you know, company closes, you know, if Twitter, the methane Twitter is"
"7959710","7964890"," going to close, but if it ever did in three year notes, awards, seven spots, six, eight percent,"
"7964890","7965790"," bids at high. "
"7968170","7975590"," So you know, there's a 49 billion dollars in six month bills, 10 awards, 10 spots, six percent of"
"7975590","7976250"," bids at high."
"7979590","7983790"," You know, so if Twitter was to ever shut down, uh, you know, you have to have a place, if"
"7983790","7987690"," there's ever, if there be, if there be, have your own thing going on."
"7992410","7997370"," So what, uh, I'd expect to visit saying Nick Tamarose, uh, he's, if any of you guys don't know,"
"7997430","8002650"," he's the, the mouthpiece for the Fed or the publicly acknowledged mouthpiece of the Fed. "
"8002790","8004050"," What did he say unexpected visit?"
"8006070","8011830"," Fed inflation expectations all going down earlier, yeah, it, it's not just down either."
"8012390","8014330"," It should be rapid down."
"8014630","8020070"," It should be, it should be like this, like a straight down inflation. "
"8020710","8022750"," Now the issue is an inflation, the issue is unemployment."
"8024070","8028270"," And that's where, that's why we've been, that's why I've been trading down all year."
"8028610","8034730"," There's some, so there's some underneath the hood stuff, um, that the market wants resolved. "
"8039670","8041650"," Yeah, we're not using constant contact."
"8041930","8045950"," And as a matter of fact, the company, uh, blocked us from sending any more emails."
"8046450","8051830"," So they were like, you have to off, off, offload this onto a company that can handle, um, sending"
"8051830","8053670"," all these, these mass emails out. "
"8053850","8055990"," So I guess that's what the problem is right now or issue."
"8056590","8060530"," We don't speak with problems right when you're, it's like always issues and incidents."
"8061770","8064950"," We're going to, we're going to launch an investigation and make a decision. "
"8073020","8075400"," Yeah, I showed you the, I showed it to you this morning, right?"
"8075520","8076380"," You guys saw it this morning."
"8076920","8078300"," It's not rocket science here."
"8079040","8083520"," Um, it's happening and they can, they can not admit it. "
"8083880","8086040"," The last, the last speech from him was a joke."
"8086360","8092660"," It was like, you could hear that the, the pivot, but the market's not buying it."
"8092740","8098200"," The market wants to see the unemployment and you guys all know, you guys all know, right?"
"8098340","8100400"," You want to see that unemployment, uh, figure rising. "
"8105920","8106720"," Seven point."
"8107000","8114580"," Yeah, I don't think, uh, we all know, yeah, I don't, CPI can hold whatever narrative it wants."
"8114680","8115320"," It doesn't matter. "
"8116460","8118920"," No, but it's not a bullish narrative without unemployment coming up."
"8119000","8119500"," It really isn't."
"8119580","8122920"," Well, you need to have unemployment coming up, see a bottom. "
"8124520","8126580"," We haven't seen the 45 VIX, right?"
"8128480","8132540"," You want to show you the, the VIX chart where it should be, it looks like it's going to 45,"
"8132820","8133160"," doesn't it?"
"8133780","8136220"," How do we get it to 45 by going up?"
"8152220","8158200"," The easiest thing to do is create Dropbox or OneDrive, public folder and drop links on Guy Capron's"
"8158200","8158340"," Alpha."
"8158680","8160500"," Yeah, I think that's the easiest thing to do too."
"8161760","8162980"," Uh, but I have to keep it. "
"8162980","8164540"," So the, the issue isn't that."
"8165380","8173880"," Uh, Robin, the issue is that I need a place for, um, like you could, like, here's a prime example."
"8174240","8179500"," This morning I posted, uh, some videos about Elon Musk and I didn't do it to be negative. "
"8180000","8184760"," I did it because, uh, even if you're a Tesla bull, you want to go to see those videos."
"8185520","8189420"," If I were to catch some strikes for that, I could be kicked off YouTube, right?"
"8189620","8194540"," I could be kicked off, uh, Twitter for, um, some kind of violation, right?"
"8194879","8197920"," I see, you see people getting deplatformed on Twitter all the time."
"8198420","8204900"," So if I had no way to, uh, communicate with you outside of Twitter, outside of YouTube, outside of"
"8204900","8212120"," Twitch, outside of, you know, TikTok or, uh, Reddit or wherever, uh, you'd be like, well, how do we"
"8212120","8212660"," find him?"
"8213320","8215660"," Um, just imagine, not that this would happen. "
"8215660","8217840"," Let's just say Twitter closed tomorrow, right?"
"8219219","8220440"," And Fintuit was gone."
"8221139","8222480"," Uh, where would be the meetup spot?"
"8222799","8224920"," How would you find other people from Fintuit?"
"8225620","8231780"," So you're going to hope that, uh, there's a group of people, uh, there's a way to contact them so"
"8231780","8233059"," that they could find a new home, right?"
"8233760","8235120"," Whatever that place would be."
"8236639","8242160"," So you kind of, you kind of want to, you know, if, if I know a thousand people that are"
"8242160","8247580"," off platform from Twitter, I can always email you and say, hey, we're all going over to, or I heard"
"8247580","8252959"," from so and so that we're all going over to Fintuit's moving to this new platform and this old"
"8252959","8253280"," platform. "
"8253639","8260160"," We're all moving back to, uh, Yahoo, you know, that's, that's the key behind it."
"8262600","8263559"," Do I day trade?"
"8263840","8265459"," I, I day trade on this channel all the time."
"8265740","8269940"," If you ask anyone that watches the stream, I live trade here all the time. "
"8270260","8271799"," I'm not trading this right here though."
"8272340","8274860"," I've got, or this right here, I've got no interest in this right here."
"8275320","8276959"," This is all capture right now. "
"8277580","8279540"," This is intended, intended to capture you."
"8280580","8282160"," I want nothing to do with it."
"8286000","8287920"," Meetup spots, Wall Street bets, baby. "
"8288219","8290139"," I noticed, I got to be honest with you guys."
"8290299","8292219"," Many of you guys are current Wall Street betters."
"8292860","8296459"," I'm an old school, Wall Street betters and you guys are bringing it back to old school. "
"8296680","8297940"," I'm going to give you some props there."
"8298700","8303980"," I'm very impressed with, uh, where, well, at least on the surface, wherever, I don't know what's"
"8303980","8310320"," going on behind the scenes of Wall Street bets, but I have been checking in lately and I'm, it's"
"8310320","8316719"," starting to remind me of, uh, you know, a slightly older Wall Street bets, which is nice to see."
"8318520","8319719"," The rule blocks meetups. "
"8320020","8326459"," Oh, you know, we could do is, was it Trove, Trove, Trove, or that site's got like zero people on"
"8326459","8326600"," it."
"8326920","8328900"," And I think that's part of Tencent."
"8334799","8341459"," Yeah, you know, so I've checked out, I got my one concern with Mastodon and, um, there's a few of"
"8341459","8341680"," them, right?"
"8341860","8345940"," There's Mastodon and then there's, uh, the right has a couple places. "
"8346219","8351480"," I forget the names of all these places, but I have signed up for all of them and the scary"
"8351480","8357840"," part right just right now, the only thing that's scary about any of those sites is I'm very fearful"
"8357840","8367379"," that there you, or that companies are using those places as small echo chambers so that everyone's"
"8367379","8368080"," agreeing with everybody."
"8370330","8372690"," I have this feeling, not a feeling."
"8374030","8374969"," I shouldn't say feeling. "
"8375190","8384309"," I should say in prior experiences, I'm an old man, uh, looks like there's compartmentalization"
"8384309","8389950"," going on with, um, it's very similar to like Fox News and, um, MSNBC."
"8391370","8397930"," You'll get people that'll be, you start to get Facebook has the same, same thing going on."
"8398990","8405230"," You start to get compartmentalized and it's always an echo chamber and everything sounds right. "
"8406850","8413630"," Everyone's agreeing, doesn't matter what it is, and then boom, you're being fed and by the powers"
"8413630","8419530"," that be and you don't know it and I'm not saying that's what those places are right now, but it"
"8419530","8420710"," sure is looking like it."
"8420890","8425010"," It's starting to like walk and talk like a duck, not just Mastodon or Mastodon or whatever."
"8425570","8426710"," Uh, the others too. "
"8426870","8428070"," I've gone in and checked them all out."
"8432140","8434340"," What's everybody's thoughts on hot CPI to Moz?"
"8435780","8436460"," Who cares?"
"8437260","8437960"," It means nothing."
"8438660","8440360"," I don't know, my view, it means nothing. "
"8444350","8445010"," Yeah, true."
"8445150","8445310"," All right."
"8445430","8451390"," So ergo say Mastodon Mastodon counter social on left truth parlor grabbing the gap on the right. "
"8453690","8458030"," If you go to those places, right, I don't care what your political beliefs are."
"8458350","8463750"," If you, if you, let's say you're, let's say you're from the right and you meet up with someone from"
"8463750","8472590"," the left and you just ask each other because you'll figure it out quick that there's um that"
"8472590","8474350"," they're intended to an extent right now."
"8474490","8482850"," They're all small, you know, relatively speaking, but I would change my opinion if a bunch of"
"8482850","8492750"," different people were in that one place, but so far, all of them look like intended to be echo"
"8492750","8496990"," chambers, places for agreement. "
"8496990","8497890"," I'm not one."
"8500670","8506030"," And that doesn't, that that's not um, supporting Twitter right now either."
"8507090","8509530"," I have some real real issues with Twitter right now. "
"8509550","8519170"," There's a lot of, uh, I don't, I'm not really a fan of the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the,"
"8519170","8524150"," the, the rage stuff, like intentionally, it's weird."
"8524810","8526050"," I have lived over the world."
"8526230","8529570"," I've lived all over the United States and it's, it's such a big place. "
"8529970","8540190"," And when you're putting, you know, intentionally putting like a real Nazi next to, you"
"8540190","8546610"," know, like I've got a gay people in my family, LGBT people in my family, far to put my family"
"8546610","8553010"," members and most of their friends together, they wouldn't look like anyone that's being placed"
"8553010","8555150"," right next to a, you know, stormtrooper Nazi."
"8555410","8561830"," So getting these like very small, small, small, small, small, small, um, extreme beliefs."
"8562630","8568070"," And then, of course, you're meant to take a side and then you're meant to fight with your friends"
"8568070","8575590"," over this and, um, the only people that are fighting over this are the little people. "
"8576030","8577390"," And it's very, very destructive."
"8578610","8583590"," And, uh, but I still want to see that, you know, not those, I don't want to see the highlights"
"8583590","8585230"," on that, on those ideas."
"8585990","8589170"," I want to see the highlight on the normal people, like not normal people, but just people that are"
"8589170","8589750"," living their lives. "
"8591190","8593010"," My best life they can live and stuff like that."
"8593290","8597050"," So I'm struggling with that side of Twitter right now."
"8597270","8604290"," I've struggled with, uh, and like it's almost like clickbait on a crazy level. "
"8606170","8607850"," You see, you see the rage too."
"8607950","8612650"," You can see the rage even, but even amongst people that trade together or, uh, bulls and bears, and"
"8612650","8621050"," it just becomes this like really over aggressive, uh, like just gnarliness."
"8621370","8622750"," And it's kind of, it's kind of crazy to see. "
"8625590","8631250"," I expect some of that, but, uh, you know, you don't want to be the ringleader of that stuff either,"
"8631250","8631570"," right?"
"8637180","8638300"," You guys want to look at some stuff?"
"8641860","8642220"," Yeah."
"8642540","8642620"," Yeah."
"8642960","8644540"," There's, there's a ton of money behind this. "
"8644700","8648020"," There's, there's, uh, and you have to pick a poison."
"8648220","8651780"," I know the government sucks, and I'm not a fan of the government in any way or shape or form,"
"8652700","8654160"," and they're going to play their card too, right?"
"8654380","8654960"," It's all about money."
"8655060","8656060"," It's all about digital dollar. "
"8656220","8659880"," It's all about, uh, power of who's providing the speech platform."
"8662100","8666600"," I'm shocked that as a citizen you're going to give, give up, you know, I think the government sucks"
"8666600","8669340"," at this, and I don't want the government to be in charge of this."
"8669400","8674180"," But at the same time, I'm like, they, the whole reason we have government is to protect free"
"8674180","8674560"," speech. "
"8675460","8681860"," And so, uh, to give that up in your vote up to an oligarch or a company or anybody out"
"8681860","8689280"," there like that is insane to me, uh, that fight that's going on out there, uh, but we don't, we"
"8689280","8692280"," don't hold our politicians, doesn't matter what party you're in."
"8692920","8698000"," I just ran a story that said Texas like 30 or 40% of people under 30 didn't vote."
"8698800","8699980"," And I'm like, this is all Encino. "
"8699980","8702360"," Yeah, absolutely Adam."
"8702560","8703040"," It's, it's crazy."
"8703780","8705800"," Like watching this right now as it unfolds. "
"8706980","8708460"," And of course we're all here."
"8708840","8709520"," We're nobody's right."
"8709760","8710560"," Nobody cares about us. "
"8711040","8712700"," Uh, we don't have a voice."
"8713780","8718340"," Uh, the real voice is in the real power of the real money that they have the voices, right?"
"8718480","8721140"," And so we're, we're stuck."
"8721540","8728660"," Uh, like, it's almost like you're pitting, uh, like the Christians and the, the Christians and the,"
"8728840","8732320"," uh, the, uh, barbarians together in a fight. "
"8732700","8737680"," And we're all, you know, stabbing each other and cutting each other's throats and it's wild."
"8738600","8742160"," You've got, of course, you get the fans on the up in the stands and they're screaming."
"8742920","8744640"," Everybody honors are doing this to each other. "
"8744800","8752020"," Meanwhile, it's all being, um, orchestrated by a very small group of people that, uh, want to see"
"8752020","8752520"," us all entertained."
"8753280","8754040"," That's the truth."
"8754640","8758340"," None of this has changed over, uh, hundreds of years. "
"8758640","8759120"," We were just right."
"8759700","8760500"," We're at the height of it again."
"8760720","8765500"," You know, EU adopts council added restrictive measures against Iran. "
"8772550","8772990"," Yeah."
"8772990","8775870"," Yeah, uh, Andre is asking me how I learned how to trade."
"8776050","8785410"," So I started trading back when, uh, I started trading back when, uh, Bitcoin first became a thing. "
"8788210","8789490"," Yeah, it's a gladiator pit."
"8789610","8792070"," I started trading with Bitcoin was nothing was worthless."
"8792930","8800010"," And, uh, and then I started to, there was weird too, because Yahoo was going away and becoming"
"8800010","8800790"," infested by bots. "
"8801050","8803130"," They cleaned out the last crash."
"8803210","8804310"," We had they cleaned everybody out."
"8805770","8812170"," And, uh, it went from there to Wall Street bets and its infancy and then Wall Street bets taught me"
"8812170","8812490"," my thing. "
"8812970","8816550"," I met a couple, couple guys there that took me to the wings, bent toward me."
"8817050","8822950"," Uh, I want to take it some classes, uh, read some books and then continued on with, uh, different"
"8822950","8829690"," mentorships with, uh, some market makers and, um, some pit traders over the years paid"
"8829690","8838010"," a some points had, uh, like a social media personality."
"8838770","8846530"," And I was banned, uh, I was banned, uh, years ago because I had pissed off, uh, some, some very"
"8846530","8847170"," important people. "
"8847650","8853410"," I was disgruntled that, uh, had some fraud that was going on the market."
"8853670","8857370"," So, um, and then some stuff happened in Wall Street bets."
"8858010","8862910"," You guys know it went from, you know, this many followers to a million followers. "
"8862910","8864110"," So I switched over to Twitter."
"8865170","8871790"," Uh, a lot of Wall Street betters, uh, longtime Wall Street betters, uh, moved or, you know, fled"
"8871790","8874610"," over to Twitter that hadn't made the move after all those years."
"8875010","8880130"," Uh, some of those people you know out there, um, it's been like the last holdouts are now on"
"8880130","8880390"," Twitter. "
"8881190","8889150"," Uh, they've made the move over the past couple of years and, um, then of course I'm doing this live"
"8889150","8896070"," because I see people that, uh, I make poor trading decisions."
"8897010","8901190"," And so I figured, well, I think the biggest thing that I missed are I lost out on."
"8901550","8902730"," I think the biggest key for me. "
"8903330","8904570"," I made so many mistakes."
"8904890","8911930"," I had taken classes, I had read books, watched YouTube videos, um, everything except for the"
"8911930","8912310"," mentorship."
"8912590","8919530"," The mentorships, uh, started out with just DMS and messaging and then phone calls, uh, then trading"
"8919530","8923630"," with other investor. "
"8924630","8931230"," And, uh, in the past five years or so, I've watched the rise of the retail trader and, uh, it"
"8931230","8932790"," became amplified the last two years."
"8934170","8938210"," And I, I had this like inside thing where I'm like, you know what?"
"8938410","8943030"," I was like, uh, I was like a lot of these people just need someone with them when they're trading."
"8944670","8949270"," So I was like, I was like, we'll try it out and see what happens. "
"8958070","8958770"," And that's right."
"8958970","8963030"," I remember before the cash locations, I, I, that's one of the biggest mistakes."
"8963370","8965250"," I've had like, I've had some big mistakes in life. "
"8965430","8966310"," That was one of the biggest ones."
"8967250","8971810"," What's crazy is, uh, when was the Occupy Wall Street Burning Man?"
"8972150","8973230"," Do you remember what year that was?"
"8974470","8975690"," Was that 07 or 09?"
"8976890","8978910"," It was 09, it was 09, it was Occupy Wall Street."
"8979210","8980110"," So was that Burning Man?"
"8981190","8989670"," And that year, we had, uh, my next door neighbor had, had built, I'm not going to tell you where,"
"8989850","8996230"," but, uh, he was an engineer for, uh, TV studio and they were using the servers in there to mine"
"8996230","8998470"," Bitcoin way back then. "
"8998850","9004110"," And, uh, remember I gave up Bitcoin and never ever stood on that."
"9005470","9011830"," When I went through other motions, I, you know, traded, uh, Bitcoin, then I traded, uh, stocks, uh,"
"9011910","9012830"," just owning and selling."
"9015530","9017590"," Cash secured puts, covered calls. "
"9019010","9027950"," I went down the hole with, uh, with, uh, biotech and penny stocks and wanted to have trade spreads."
"9029030","9033990"," Ten futures, stopped sleeping, got out of futures, learned how to trade the wheel."
"9034750","9040550"," I thought it was a smart trader, started to trade, I started trading flies, complicated stuff that"
"9040550","9043490"," was taken up all my time for pennies, in my view. "
"9048950","9050390"," Now most of my trading is simple."
"9050710","9056030"," I've been reduced to that the past three years, it started about, it started about three years ago."
"9056510","9062270"," It actually started in the, when the stock market rose in 2020, at the end of 2020, I was reduced"
"9062270","9065930"," and then 2021 I was reduced to what I was doing. "
"9066130","9075810"," Now this year, um, this year was, this year has been, uh, nine, ten trades a year with money, like"
"9075810","9076790"," real money, like big money."
"9078390","9086090"," And then, uh, day trading when I can, uh, I, I used the love to hold overnight positions, uh, one"
"9086090","9091870"," of like the last things vestiges was, I love trading, um, overnight zero date holds, can't even do"
"9091870","9092970"," those that frequently anymore."
"9093610","9100130"," Too much, uh, too much, uh, selling futures, buying cash, buying cat, no, and, and then I get, and"
"9100130","9103190"," then you've got like, no reverses between negative and positive gamma. "
"9103610","9106350"," It's like, so all that stuff's out the window."
"9106950","9113290"," So now I'm basically doing, uh, uh, day trades during the day, usually zero dates, one dates, three"
"9113290","9115830"," day, or five dates on the, on the spot."
"9117170","9125490"," And then I placed them, uh, some really oversold conditions, uh, to, to buy a bottom with far"
"9125490","9128330"," enough time on it and the spread and, uh, they print a hundred percent amount. "
"9129190","9131490"," I don't care about how much more it goes up."
"9131550","9134570"," I don't care about missing out on money, any of that stuff."
"9134730","9136550"," And that just keeps me alive and flowing. "
"9136790","9143490"," And I took a bunch of money out of stock market and, uh, paid off, uh, debt and bought houses,"
"9143550","9149370"," been talking, but, but publicly on Twitter for the past couple of years, buying, buying, uh, run"
"9149370","9150750"," down houses and rehabbing them."
"9152270","9154190"," And I'm running into issues with that right now."
"9154190","9161050"," So, uh, this last house that I bought, uh, I had a, I bought it and then I had a,"
"9161410","9164730"," I had a budget of about $50,000 to renovate it. "
"9164890","9169610"," And when it's inflation hit, man, they'll, they'll get the money out of your hands one way or"
"9169610","9169870"," another."
"9170530","9176870"," Um, the government will, the government will tax as well and, uh, cost of goods, cost of services,"
"9178010","9179010"," all this inflation stuff."
"9179370","9184210"," Uh, so get, you know, like you try to hide your money in real estate and then it's like, uh,"
"9184890","9189270"," I don't know, $5,000 roof, believe it or not, turns into like doing yourself, turns into like 15,"
"9189970","9190450"," 20,000. "
"9191210","9192410"," Go to a real legit company."
"9192550","9194110"," It's now 30, 50,000 dollars."
"9194110","9198610"," The kitchens are now, you know, pros doing it 70, 80, 90,000 dollars just insane. "
"9198890","9204030"," So, like every place you're trying to put money, it doesn't matter if you're losing in the stock"
"9204030","9209510"," market or if you're losing it, uh, you know, the goods, as a matter of fact, it's crazy, right?"
"9210150","9215130"," So I, I went out last week or two and I had some, uh, fast food for the first time,"
"9215130","9216510"," like, like six months."
"9217430","9218530"," I don't really eat fast food."
"9219410","9226010"," And then I was traveling and I wound up eating two meals with my wife and children while we were"
"9226010","9231210"," traveling to and unusual for us, right?"
"9232510","9239490"," And the bills with fast food for four people was, uh, something like, I think one bill was, uh, $53"
"9239490","9248080"," and the other bill was, um, I don't, we're trying to remember exactly what it was. "
"9248940","9253380"," I think it was $53 and then it was another high price."
"9254160","9257300"," But it was like 80 to 100 bucks or something like that, somewhere in there."
"9257700","9260600"," And, uh, I was shocked at how much that cost. "
"9260840","9261880"," I was like, man, I was eight people."
"9262180","9266260"," I was like, and then I'm thinking to myself, in my brain, I'm like, well, what is people someone to"
"9266260","9272680"," spend or I'd say someone earns 130, 140 dollars and they're being taxed elsewhere in their life."
"9273380","9274860"," My property taxes have gone through the roof. "
"9275060","9279100"," So I'm like counting all this stuff up, like then people's electric bills have gone through the"
"9279100","9283640"," roof and I'm thinking about how much money to get someone to have that kind of money to pay for,"
"9284120","9288900"," uh, going out to what used to be in a small cost, right?"
"9291000","9297620"," Like you could afford that even if you made, I don't know, 700 to 1000 bucks a week, you could"
"9297620","9302740"," afford to go to a McDonald's at least a couple times, three times or something more your local"
"9302740","9303120"," place."
"9303540","9304900"," So I was a little shocked."
"9305940","9313120"," I'm gonna tell you what, gonna have a guy for all the housework. "
"9313380","9313620"," Absolutely."
"9317100","9318040"," Hey, Rowan, how are you?"
"9320840","9321520"," Yeah, what do you get?"
"9321760","9323000"," Uh, what do you got, Rowan?"
"9325940","9327600"," Trading in the zone is an awesome book, Troy."
"9329520","9330080"," Market wizards. "
"9330860","9331760"," I've got that book on myself."
"9331760","9332840"," I got both on myself."
"9333980","9335220"," There's two market wizards books. "
"9335600","9336980"," Those are two of my favorites."
"9339080","9342160"," Matter of fact, I'm not positive on this."
"9343300","9351840"," Don't quote me on this, but I think we know somebody that was either in that room with those guys"
"9351840","9355420"," reminiscent or knew those guys really close. "
"9356280","9359240"," I'm not gonna name him here, but that's a kickass book."
"9362400","9363840"," Yeah, nature of risk is ratebook."
"9364020","9367600"," There's a lot of good gambling books out there that'll help you trade better as well. "
"9368160","9373420"," Let's buy about the pop 400."
"9374800","9376240"," You know, normally I would say that."
"9376780","9377440"," I don't know. "
"9378540","9380080"," You guys want to take a close look at it."
"9384030","9387970"," I mean, normally you'd say yes, right?"
"9388570","9394530"," Normally you'd call it and look back up showing showing really light people even doing this with"
"9394530","9395170"," you right now."
"9396630","9402950"," It is showing light support, but you're talking about a very, very, very, very small order book. "
"9403190","9405690"," I want you to know that this isn't real support right here."
"9407310","9411550"," And then I also want you to know that as soon as you're getting, as soon as you're getting strength"
"9411550","9412110"," pair, right?"
"9413370","9415910"," Let me get rid of that red because then the guys don't want to see that."
"9422400","9422880"," Okay. "
"9425000","9426720"," They are somewhat selling in the strength."
"9426780","9431700"," If you look in the order book, keep your eyes on hidden sellers in here."
"9434440","9439920"," Though this line right here is where that yellow bar isn't that red bar above. "
"9440180","9441080"," You see that 3995?"
"9442540","9450460"," Yeah, 395 is up here, but you can see that red and gray bar."
"9451280","9452860"," There are there are there are sellers."
"9453100","9455160"," I promise you there's some hidden sellers right here too. "
"9456520","9460780"," Let's be conscious of it as you trade up into this with a light book."
"9461000","9462060"," It takes some time, right?"
"9477730","9478850"," I appreciate that."
"9481930","9483390"," I've got some stuff for you. "
"9483390","9490010"," So I've got I've got you guys are going to get a newsletter with a real squeeze."
"9490410","9499250"," You're going to get a newsletter that that licensed guys have baskets of stocks."
"9499890","9504510"," And I'll show you guys those stocks that are very squeezable. "
"9505470","9509930"," And then I've got a bunch of stocks that the banks have run."
"9510470","9512110"," So wait till you see that stuff."
"9513630","9518830"," We ran the if you if you ask like the Quinn of S or Joe Donut out there, they were"
"9518830","9522290"," they kept running ETFs of those those plays past couple of years. "
"9523210","9526450"," And I'll have those for you in the next week, week after something like that."
"9527170","9528290"," And we'll talk about them in depth."
"9535670","9536550"," So let's see what you got. "
"9537850","9540790"," We'll look at we'll take a trip around the market here in just a minute."
"9541290","9543430"," And as to me guys are probably probably long in here."
"9543430","9545130"," So we'll stick around in this for just a moment. "
"9545130","9546270"," Then we'll take a walk around the market."
"9547170","9556870"," Kappa have 1216 SPX 390 P and a 1234 and see both down wondering if I should just hold with"
"9556870","9559470"," a down move term and send really into month."
"9559770","9562650"," I don't know, Row it. "
"9562770","9564290"," I would I would say I don't know when you bottom."
"9565190","9566810"," You don't have to publish that here."
"9567050","9575190"," But what I would say to you is the SPX puts should be up from just from premium kick at"
"9575190","9575610"," this point. "
"9577290","9580890"," There were had just closed earlier in the week that maybe why you're down on the puts."
"9581730","9587830"," There was a there was a de hedging that went on premium capture that went on into last Friday."
"9588330","9594210"," And then of course, I think Chase was talking about this holding over into Monday would kill some"
"9594210","9595050"," of that premium as well. "
"9595850","9597330"," Not you guys can't see this behind the screen."
"9600850","9607610"," The only thing that I could say to you would be that's not enough time to cat."
"9607790","9610230"," Usually it's not enough time on a well it's a couple things. "
"9610670","9613350"," So if you're going to straddle the market, let's start at A1."
"9614410","9621910"," If you're going to straddle the market for the decision on Wednesday and a possible rally and Santa"
"9621910","9628150"," rally or a ball crush rally or swing high, swing low, you probably want to have them dated a month,"
"9628270","9630330"," three months out and very much in the money."
"9631070","9637970"," And you would want to place them at some point last week into the end of today at this at"
"9637970","9648010"," exactly $3.95. So $3.95 put $3.05 call in the money month, three months out on them, you'll"
"9648010","9648910"," probably catch both sides. "
"9652010","9652870"," That's a tough place."
"9653190","9654390"," I don't know what to say to you."
"9654390","9661370"," You could possibly roll them your puts could lose some real value. "
"9661670","9667150"," Let's say we go down on Wednesday, you might be able to catch the value in that put and the"
"9667150","9667830"," value in that call."
"9668030","9672930"," But you're going to have to trigger the sell like that in that five 15 20 half an hour on"
"9672930","9674870"," at least one side of it that's printing for you."
"9676450","9678630"," That's I've been in those bad trades before. "
"9678950","9686570"," So when those trades happen right, you'll be in the trade and you'll see wild though if you see the"
"9686570","9690810"," wild swings high or low, there'll be a resetting of prices."
"9691590","9697670"," It doesn't affect SPX as much as it does the spy because of liquidity, but you're going to have to"
"9697670","9700490"," be very focused on capturing profit."
"9702750","9707810"," So puts can still go down and you'll actually lose money on the reprising is my point. "
"9708450","9710070"," You'll say, yeah, cap, we're still burning."
"9711990","9715830"," It may, but if it swings high again, right, it'll burn them even more."
"9715830","9719870"," And then when it finally does go down in that reprising, you'll get trashed. "
"9720150","9726510"," So if you're going to stay in that trade, the only thing you can say to you is that you're"
"9726510","9730890"," likely going to be like, see your pants on Wednesday."
"9732830","9735690"," I'm trying to catch that move in both ends."
"9738580","9739180"," It's okay. "
"9739700","9740440"," I mean, you can do it."
"9740760","9742860"," It's just very nerve wracking when you do it."
"9744260","9746120"," I don't care how good of a trader you are. "
"9746200","9747920"," I promise you, it's very nerve wracking."
"9748420","9752240"," And then if you get out too early or be pissed off because you could have made X amount of"
"9752240","9756920"," dollars to cover your calls or your puts or whatever, it's a very, very nerve wracking."
"9757140","9762840"," The one thing I would recommend to you would be looking for the implied move on Wednesday and set"
"9762840","9763540"," yourself up. "
"9764400","9769000"," So if you have an implied move on Wednesday, you're going to be looking for tagging the top and"
"9769000","9774780"," bottom end of that, capturing whatever you can out of that trade, and then making it up on another"
"9774780","9775100"," trade."
"9778760","9787900"," You could have rolled those, but I don't know what to say to you on that."
"9789220","9792940"," I'm assuming that the puts were up at some point or you, I don't know when you position yourself"
"9792940","9796940"," either because I get some things you need to know like when you took each side of that trade. "
"9799100","9802900"," And then I do assure you one thing though, it can be dangerous."
"9803940","9806480"," It can be dangerous after the event ball goes down."
"9810450","9814530"," Starting a trade higher now, looking for the upper move inside of the spy. "
"9816390","9826240"," I haven't checked to see what the 3.9, I'm assuming it's a dollar somewhere"
"9826240","9827600"," somewhere right in here."
"9831600","9833240"," Coming into resistance right now."
"9836920","9837960"," Right about here. "
"9839420","9840520"," Maybe a little bit higher."
"9842400","9843140"," A second here."
"9852140","9853440"," Maybe slightly higher. "
"9862780","9863820"," We'll take a look above."
"9864000","9866680"," There's a standing order there of 400 cell."
"9868500","9870100"," 439 just triggered just now. "
"9874380","9876120"," And there's a place higher too."
"9878420","9879960"," I don't know what the spread difference is."
"9880120","9881380"," I don't have to check what the spread is right now. "
"9881380","9881820"," Hold on a second."
"9881920","9882800"," I'm going to do this to math on it."
"9886810","9887770"," Let me just second here. "
"9892370","9893810"," We'll start putting bubbles up."
"9901190","9905950"," 3992, 392, 397."
"9912960","9914260"," Let me just say I'm just in quick math. "
"9915360","9920320"," I haven't the contract rolls taking place and I haven't seen what the relationship between yes and"
"9920320","9920820"," spires."
"9926400","9928780"," There's no agreement yet on Russia sanctions."
"9929160","9929840"," We'll have to keep working. "
"9932700","9934980"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."
"9935540","9938020"," Ticksright allows you to actually hear water flames."
"9938220","9939940"," So 3.5, that's pretty big. "
"9940420","9942820"," 3.5 is pretty big."
"9947660","9948980"," That's pretty huge actually."
"9951100","9952320"," Just smashing and bashing. "
"9955140","9959820"," So 3.5 is 390, 396."
"9963660","9966340"," So this is so this I want to show you this right here."
"9966440","9970880"," So watch my cursor right here and then I want you to see that I think I could be wrong"
"9970880","9971200"," in this. "
"9971320","9971700"," I haven't."
"9972840","9975800"," I didn't spend my morning here checking the roll difference."
"9975920","9976760"," I think that's 390. "
"9977000","9979260"," I think this is our one up here, 39623."
"9979760","9980560"," That could be wrong."
"9980880","9983560"," We'll we'll check it for today and personally we're aware of it tomorrow. "
"9985600","9987060"," I'm going to see if we can get some consolidation."
"9987460","9990300"," Have a little bit of a tweezer reversal here."
"9990400","9993960"," We'll see if it gets picked back up to get a reversal. "
"9994260","9997460"," You're checking the second, the third candle to see if it turns green."
"9999440","10002060"," We'll see if it consolidates or starts to roll."
"10003380","10005260"," Looks like our one's going to get the target though. "
"10006060","10007400"," It's going to be the target."
"10009480","10010940"," I think I posted that this morning."
"10011080","10015840"," I think this morning I said, I think this morning on Twitter I said our one and then we'll start"
"10015840","10016640"," selling into the bell. "
"10017560","10018700"," That could be wrong on that."
"10024790","10026930"," There's a put closing banana going on right now."
"10032260","10035060"," Oh man, nobody I knew guys that didn't switch over. "
"10035480","10037580"," I know guys that didn't switch over until Friday."
"10038220","10041980"," I know guys that traded the December contract into Friday."
"10047480","10048680"," I saw trading view. "
"10049020","10051320"," I saw trading view it switched over early last week."
"10051600","10053100"," I think it posted that or reposted that."
"10053300","10056020"," I think options really are setting notice that I'm trading view. "
"10057520","10059620"," But I know guys are definitely trading it into Friday."
"10062200","10064100"," You guys want to take a look at Tesla real quick?"
"10064480","10066120"," We'll take let's take a quick look at Tesla."

"10077380","10078980"," Let me adjust the second here."
"10082940","10086700"," Can I have an updated support reason?"
"10087040","10089360"," I didn't have time to update them. "
"10091670","10092470"," Let's see here."
"10092570","10093050"," Give me just a second."
"10094730","10096830"," What am I looking for here?"
"10099790","10101090"," Full blaze on over. "
"10101090","10109560"," We're pretty big reversal right now on spy so you can see it."
"10114240","10115980"," You guys want to see this?"
"10116580","10118380"," These are nice moves right here by the way."
"10119680","10120980"," Viewups down below, right?"
"10121180","10122500"," We always talk about these moves, right?"
"10122680","10127880"," You get one, two, three push up classic day trading. "
"10130240","10131380"," Come back down, right?"
"10131620","10132800"," We got push down right here."
"10133780","10135080"," All right, bam, bam."
"10135780","10136860"," Health support with strength. "
"10137200","10138400"," Come back up here."
"10139760","10141520"," More more sellers above."
"10142700","10144460"," So what are bears looking for here?"
"10144580","10144820"," Do you know?"
"10146700","10149580"," I think we might get our one up here but what are the bears looking for?"
"10150220","10151120"," Coming in before our one. "
"10151680","10155120"," Bears looking to turn this support here into resistance, right?"
"10156500","10158980"," So the bear is looking to get underneath the screen bar."
"10160020","10161580"," Start taking it down, right?"
"10165260","10167080"," Let me see if I can erase that and switch it."
"10169300","10170060"," Up, bam it. "
"10173000","10175740"," Bears looking to turn all this."
"10180220","10181340"," That's all looks beautiful by the way."
"10182560","10183960"," I wasn't paying too close attention to it. "
"10185820","10186760"," Bears going to be looking."
"10187440","10188580"," Bears want to be getting underneath."
"10191840","10195360"," You want to come down here, make you think. "
"10197740","10200980"," Now they're going to make one more attack above, right?"
"10201220","10203040"," But actually they're just going to blast it right down on you."
"10203960","10205320"," At least a VWAP down here."
"10205460","10207780"," So your price target down may be $394.08 if you're a bear. "
"10212380","10219990"," And you see your price target above, $396.23. This is our one over here."
"10223010","10223510"," You can see it."
"10230520","10232020"," There's a good pop on Microsoft's one. "
"10237720","10238420"," Yeah, we'll see."
"10238720","10239960"," We're going to take a quick look at Tesla."
"10242840","10244520"," Because there are some things on Tesla. "
"10244780","10245260"," This is bad."
"10245440","10246280"," This is worse than bad."
"10251660","10260320"," I can assure you, if you are a Tesla bull that you did not want to see this today, okay?"
"10263300","10265700"," You did not want to see this today. "
"10270400","10272800"," This is a big no-go for Tesla."
"10279300","10283780"," And I'm telling you, this is a big no-go for Tesla."
"10285980","10297400"," Tesla wanted today to have a constructive move up in something like this or"
"10297400","10299340"," trade sideways to the decision. "
"10302180","10303380"," At least here."
"10304140","10305320"," They really want to be here."
"10306560","10308920"," This is the most constructive move up here. "
"10309740","10313380"," When you're turning this, these buyers, right?"
"10313660","10315420"," You're coming up here and you're rejected."
"10316720","10318040"," This is no-go town."
"10318320","10319620"," This is go down time. "
"10322320","10325560"," This area of support here, you should look for."
"10325680","10326740"," We'll put the support."
"10326960","10328980"," These aren't current support resistance levels. "
"10329580","10335880"," I just want you to know, if you're a Tesla bull, that this is your next, this is it."
"10338780","10339860"," Right in there for you."
"10341140","10344540"," And this is not a good, this is not good to even be down here. "
"10346600","10352260"," You're going to start breaking levels here and start heading lower to which we talked about, right?"
"10352420","10355080"," We've talked about this in the past, right down there."
"10356760","10357460"," This is easy."
"10357640","10359020"," This is just a free fall down here. "
"10360740","10362640"," So we'll take a look at Tesla real quick."
"10364160","10364560"," Shit."
"10367360","10368520"," No bueno here. "
"10368740","10369680"," No bueno at all."
"10372060","10373380"," This is not good."
"10374700","10377700"," I know you're like, you might be like, hey Cap, but it'll probably bounce down. "
"10377800","10378820"," Yeah, it'll probably bounce down here."
"10379600","10381220"," But you're not really concerned with that."
"10381320","10384260"," What you're concerned with is bounce. "
"10384920","10390580"," Like, this is when you create the one, two, and it just, it just rips down."
"10392740","10393520"," It's not good."
"10395220","10396920"," It doesn't mean you go into puts here either. "
"10397100","10398880"," If you're like a bear, you're like, I'm going to keep going on puts."
"10400440","10401700"," You missed the trade here."
"10402080","10403260"," This is where the trade was. "
"10404300","10407880"," Right off that bell, the moment you saw this bar right here, that was it."
"10407880","10408860"," It's going down."
"10409880","10411540"," That sucks for Tesla bulls. "
"10413220","10414860"," We'll do these right now."
"10415000","10419820"," So the pivot point was 178.30. You can see it right here."
"10424050","10425570"," We'll put it, we'll right pivot in here. "
"10427230","10429850"," Sucks to be a, sucks to be a Tesla bull today."
"10430050","10444600"," You can see it"
"10444600","10445600"," right off the bell right there."
"10445840","10447080"," The screen turned into red today. "
"10447300","10450340"," The moment you crossed that pivot, that was it, right?"
"10450940","10458140"," Second, first support was 174.11. So 174.11 right here."
"10461220","10462940"," Blasted right through like it was nothing."
"10463680","10464300"," Bye-bye. "
"10465760","10466400"," Insane."
"10468240","10480410"," Next support is 169.16. Right"
"10480410","10481310"," about there."
"10481490","10482610"," We can clean these up later. "
"10483150","10484570"," It's close enough for horseshoes and hand grenades."
"10485670","10487770"," Matches upright to the support back here."
"10489350","10491110"," Get this little bit of support down below. "
"10493110","10500130"," S3 is 164.97. If we start breaking through these levels, I've got some other, I got a bunch of"
"10500130","10500510"," other shit."
"10500610","10507790"," I got retracement for you and I mean, this is not good, man."
"10507930","10511450"," When you see stuff like this, it gets nasty. "
"10512490","10516450"," You'll see this green white line over here."
"10516670","10518670"," It'll just come blasting down on it."
"10521150","10524030"," So 164.97, that's what I've got. "
"10524350","10525690"," Not a 397."
"10527290","10529010"," We'll take a closer look here."
"10531610","10532150"," Ugly. "
"10533370","10534630"," Ugly for Tesla."
"10537930","10540510"," Man, there's so much stuff going on in the background too."
"10540690","10550270"," There's stuff like opening up the door for Tesla with his bridge loans and stuff, like these banks"
"10550270","10550710"," that hold. "
"10551510","10556330"," And then you're talking about renegotiating and do right off."
"10556550","10557570"," You can see it right here, right?"
"10558390","10560010"," You can see it right here."
"10560090","10560490"," Come in here. "
"10560670","10564390"," Trade right off of VWAP and BAM."
"10566090","10567610"," You start breaking through these levels."
"10567950","10569750"," BAM, that will happen, right?"
"10572550","10573510"," That's tough. "
"10577130","10581170"," S2, I've got a 169.16, so it's even lower."
"10584690","10585530"," Right about there."
"10587890","10591550"," S3, 164.97. Yeah, that's right on the spot right there. "
"10594850","10596850"," You're going to see sellers come right here."
"10597090","10598030"," I'll close this up."
"10598450","10599590"," You'll see what that VWAP is. "
"10599930","10601950"," You're going to get more sellers right here."
"10603490","10604910"," And they're going to come right in here."
"10608670","10615610"," They're going to want to see a big volume spike, which I haven't seen yet. "
"10615690","10617390"," They're going to want to at least slam this down."

"10630190","10632050"," 170 is a natural bounce place."
"10632070","10636510"," If you were looking at a book map right now, you know that the levels are right on round numbers,"
"10636650","10636730"," right?"
"10636730","10642610"," It's going to be like 170, 165, 160, 155, even with these support levels in here."
"10643010","10645430"," You know you're going to get these are automated bounces right here. "
"10647210","10648370"," That's all this is right."
"10648510","10648970"," It's not automated."
"10649130","10652090"," There's a computer program that buys at flat numbers. "
"10653070","10659350"," Sometimes when I see stuff like this going on, I'll put in right at flat numbers, like big round"
"10659350","10659870"," hold numbers."
"10660130","10661650"," I'll put in something like this."
"10662270","10664770"," And I'm going to expect a bounce on these lines right here. "
"10664770","10667030"," But there ain't shit holding this up."
"10667070","10669990"," So I'm going to expect this to continue to sell."
"10670150","10674750"," They're going to grind down here at least or attempt to grind down below this start grinding"
"10674750","10675570"," through this ball zone. "
"10676470","10679470"," And I haven't checked to see where that put wall is on Tesla right now."
"10679870","10680690"," I was looking at it."
"10680750","10686670"," I think it's 150 right now into Tesla OPEC or the monthly OPEC for Tesla. "
"10686830","10690350"," I think it's at 150, but I could be wrong on that."
"10690710","10693410"," Don't quote me on that, but I think that's where it is."
"10695010","10695910"," Maybe it's 165. "
"10696310","10696550"," I don't know."
"10696710","10700010"," I knew what it was yesterday, and I don't remember exactly where."
"10700510","10701630"," You're going to take a look at it. "
"10701690","10702070"," Hold on a second."
"10702130","10702650"," I'll look right now."
"10710210","10711110"," So you can find it. "
"10723830","10724630"," Oh boy."
"10728510","10728910"," Yeah."
"10729190","10730750"," Blue right through blue right through. "
"10735730","10736130"," Yeah."
"10736270","10736950"," Blue right through it."
"10737150","10738610"," Blue right through Max Payne. "
"10740130","10740530"," 180."
"10740530","10740750"," 180."
"10744390","10744850"," 180. "
"10745810","10746270"," Yeah."
"10746370","10747850"," So we're way out."
"10749510","10751570"," They're just printing fucking puts right now. "
"10754350","10754810"," Man."
"10757430","10758190"," But you got these."
"10758430","10760410"," Yeah, you've got like a you got banks and stuff. "
"10760670","10761150"," You got that."
"10761290","10764450"," You got like banks now with their hands trying to get the cheapest price for he laundering,"
"10764450","10765870"," negotiate his package."
"10766830","10770630"," You've got banks now that could try to lever. "
"10772550","10774650"," Tesla right now for him to sell more shares."
"10775550","10779170"," Possibly give up Twitter at a loss for you know pennies in the dollar."
"10779690","10782050"," It's all kinds of man. "
"10783970","10785870"," Like opening yourself up to."
"10787010","10788710"," The sharks are out there."
"10789010","10790590"," There are some sharks out there. "
"10794540","10796400"," Would love to see Tesla at a low price."
"10802280","10802800"," Yeah."
"10803020","10803520"," I've got some targets. "
"10803740","10805260"," If you guys know my targets of Tesla right."
"10805260","10815300"," You know you see"
"10815300","10815700"," them right."
"10816380","10817220"," They're down here. "
"10819560","10821120"," This reversal right here."
"10821500","10823040"," These things don't end well typically."
"10826200","10830000"," If you get a fed event, maybe it'll help help the price of the stock out. "
"10830780","10832560"," At least to say that about GME or something."
"10832780","10838220"," I remember but other than that, some events helping out the price of Tesla stock."
"10839700","10842100"," This is as bearish as it can get right now. "
"10843760","10845960"," You're going to be targeting lower prices."
"10847700","10849060"," It'll take time to get there."
"10851500","10854460"," But man, that's brutal. "
"10855840","10856940"," This usually doesn't end well."
"10860900","10864880"," This usually does not end well and you'll get a capitulation moment down here too."
"10865560","10869540"," You'll hit like that 150 mark and then you'll have like a four o'clock in the morning type"
"10869540","10869880"," situation. "
"10871300","10872920"," You have to wake up early in the morning and grab."
"10873780","10874740"," Grab it to have a butt."
"10875100","10877440"," If you're a bull, I've got good news for you. "
"10880860","10885480"," These are kind of the three places that I'm looking to add some Tesla."
"10886320","10888980"," If you're a bull, there's a positive."
"10889720","10891500"," There's some light here at the end of this tunnel. "
"10892560","10898780"," If you keep selling to off and down, it's not a bad place to be long in Tesla here."
"10898880","10902760"," It's not a bad place to be long in Tesla here and not a bad place to be long in"
"10902760","10903280"," Tesla here."
"10905120","10908440"," I would love to be a Tesla owner down here. "
"10912240","10913560"," This is a tough go right here."
"10915540","10916820"," I don't know what else to say to you."
"10917060","10925680"," I would say if you think this is bottom on Tesla, I would say to you that you got a"
"10925680","10926840"," lot of work ahead of you. "
"10927640","10936780"," Because you start turning this into, if you start like the next step here is, they'll be turning"
"10936780","10939940"," this right here into resistance."
"10941000","10942720"," It's become a red bar right here."
"10944100","10944980"," Not green. "
"10945340","10951940"," Just become red and you know, this makes capitulation moves like I promise you."
"10954040","10956200"," This does, it makes capitulation moves."
"10956560","10960140"," It makes any attempt to go higher in volatility to slow you down. "
"10966600","10967420"," Yeah, I apologize."
"10968180","10969200"," I'm a Tesla bull."
"10970160","10976360"," I just want you to know if you're a Tesla bull that this is bearish. "
"10976660","10978160"," And this isn't the end of being bearish."
"10978440","10978860"," This is my point."
"10980580","10983640"," This was, we are just pretty much at a key level right here. "
"10985600","10989720"," You have to eat like the bulls kind of had it in their court to an extent."
"10990960","10992640"," This is a big push up right here, right?"
"10993240","10995440"," And you're getting secondary buyers in here, right?"
"10995600","10998040"," Trying to put, trying to push it up, right?"
"10998500","11001740"," Third tier buyers in here pushing up to the blast up higher, right?"
"11002580","11006140"," Starts getting pushed back down looking for support, which was right here."
"11007760","11010780"," And it's only makes sense to trade it down here one more time. "
"11011400","11013740"," Now to find out if there's any support left here."
"11014380","11016460"," The moment you don't have any support there, that's it."
"11016600","11017980"," It starts blasting down. "
"11022240","11023480"," So it kind of sucks."
"11025780","11031380"," If you're looking for a place for support, for you as a Tesla bull, it's level to level."
"11035120","11036320"," Bears are in control here. "
"11036480","11039760"," So bears are looking for, hey, buddy, what are you doing?"
"11041300","11044820"," You'd be looking for, you'd be looking for some kind of a support here, right?"
"11045640","11048580"," If you're a bull, you could trade this back up again."
"11050180","11051760"," But you'd be taking profit here."
"11052320","11053200"," You really would. "
"11053460","11058520"," You want the machines to start to break above this stuff up here."
"11058900","11064040"," You probably have to reset this, but all this volatility you want to get, this is where you want to"
"11064040","11065380"," be long Tesla right here."
"11066120","11068160"," Or even higher right there, it would be truthful. "
"11069060","11070900"," This would still be a level to level trade."
"11071480","11073460"," You want to get crazy bullish on Tesla?"
"11074180","11074720"," It's way up here."
"11074720","11075920"," For where we are right now. "
"11076760","11080560"," Like so much work needs to be done for Tesla to get up there."
"11081080","11087820"," That sometimes it becomes easier to just have that capitulation moment down below."
"11088120","11088600"," Does that make sense?"
"11088820","11093440"," There's so much work that needs done here that sometimes you'll see someone just start, it'll just"
"11093440","11094260"," start breaking down. "
"11095480","11099380"," And you'll find good support down here and you can take some confidence straight in here."
"11100340","11105280"," It's definitely not positive for Tesla at this point."
"11111600","11114140"," All right, so we're going to do what I normally do, okay?"
"11114440","11118000"," I know there's probably people in here that don't do this. "
"11118640","11122000"," If you want to add a tool to your toolbox, I'm going to give you one right now, okay?"
"11122640","11128480"," I don't care what stock you're trading, but if you're trading like mainstream blue chips or trading"
"11128480","11131460"," Apple, Tesla, Amazon, this doesn't always hold true either."
"11131460","11138220"," You'll see if let's say all of techs going up and Facebook's not or Met is not participating in it."
"11139480","11144960"," But this is what I do when I'm trying to get a viewpoint on the market, especially today, right?"
"11145260","11146960"," Seeing Tesla coming into some support down here. "
"11147180","11152260"," It's kind of key time to take a walk around the market and just start to see what's going on"
"11152260","11152720"," in the market."
"11153280","11154440"," Is this a bottom for Tesla?"
"11155680","11156860"," So we're going to take a look around."
"11156860","11158960"," I'll go to NDX next. "
"11164280","11166900"," And you're kind of seeing these buyers down here, right?"
"11167100","11168160"," This is actually pretty good."
"11180310","11183310"," I like seeing this right here from intraday support."
"11183730","11186630"," We know that Nasdaq has had some buyers here, right?"
"11187190","11188850"," You know, Nasdaq's had some buyers here. "
"11188930","11190530"," We know Nasdaq's had some buyers here."
"11191230","11195590"," Wouldn't be surprised to say a little bit weak here, but the bulls really need that to hold on"
"11195590","11195850"," here."
"11196470","11199150"," Last case scenario, just down in here, right?"
"11200550","11202950"," So you want to see this hold here for the bulls. "
"11203230","11205490"," We don't want to see here."
"11208640","11211120"," I want to start seeing this rejection in bloodbath."
"11212420","11214260"," You know, some kind of nonsense like this. "
"11215840","11218200"," Very risky here for Nasdaq right now."
"11220200","11223200"," Nasdaq doesn't become constructive unless it breaks out from up here."
"11223680","11226200"," I guess you could clean this up a little bit. "
"11228500","11231500"," Sorry, I don't always come over here and clean all this stuff up."
"11231660","11234140"," You could call it that right there, I guess, if you wanted to."
"11240210","11243750"," You don't want to see a rejection here, and this failure happened. "
"11244830","11246970"," You know, this is looking like into tomorrow, doesn't it?"
"11248430","11249330"," Oh, hold on here."
"11250890","11252190"," We'll take a look around the market."
"11252510","11253050"," We'll look at the VIX. "
"11254410","11255190"," So now I'm going to turn here."
"11262960","11264140"," Everybody screaming at the..."
"11264140","11265460"," Ooh, look at that VIX, baby."
"11266060","11267220"," Look at that VIX pump. "
"11268620","11269460"," Ooh, yeah."
"11270940","11273600"," This bears must be stoked right now, right?"
"11275680","11276980"," Found buyers down here."
"11277300","11277820"," Found buyers. "
"11278340","11279340"," BAMs slammed above."
"11279800","11280540"," BAM, one, two."
"11281480","11282800"," Ripping higher right now, right?"
"11285220","11286760"," Big, huge gap left behind. "
"11287840","11289160"," This is awesome to see, by the way."
"11289160","11294760"," Uh, hold on, let's kind of scale it out a little bit."
"11295320","11298620"," Yeah, bears want to be coming back up here and reclaiming, right?"
"11299520","11303800"," Bears want to be reclaiming this area up here, waiting for tomorrow's event, right?"
"11304560","11309080"," You can see, oh, I'm exaggerating on timeline here, but you can see what the bears are doing,"
"11309080","11309300"," right?"
"11309400","11311140"," They're like, we're getting some vol coming in tomorrow. "
"11315440","11317460"," This is all constructive for volatility."
"11318060","11319660"," This is good to see, by the way."
"11323240","11325580"," See that, right, on a larger time frame here?"
"11326360","11331540"," You can see, see, matter of fact, you could actually, as this is all played out, you could probably"
"11331540","11335860"," probably make a case for something in here. "
"11336840","11338560"," It is higher, I think it's higher somewhere in there."
"11339320","11340500"," But there's a case here, right?"
"11340960","11342260"," Bears got a case for some volatility."
"11343300","11345000"," When you can't say this isn't strange, right?"
"11345160","11345880"," There's just no way. "
"11346440","11351740"," Only one, two, looking for that three power move up right here, at least into 30."
"11352540","11354200"," And surprise, what do we got?"
"11354360","11357000"," We got implied ball on SPX to 30."
"11358500","11361500"," Just this looks like a achievable target here on the VIX. "
"11363620","11366940"," Hopefully somebody bought UVXY not calls, but the actual underlying."
"11369720","11373540"," We'll take, let me hold on a second, we'll take a look at a HYG."
"11374560","11376740"," Oh man, that looks like it wants to roll over so hard. "
"11378320","11380460"," It looks like it was outside, I'm going to tell you."
"11381140","11383700"," This looks very bearish right here, this construct right here."
"11385500","11389340"," Even if it's, even if it's just, even if it's kind of rejection down in here, it's kind of"
"11389340","11389780"," bloodbath. "
"11390660","11392680"," Some kind of failure up here into Wednesday."
"11395080","11397760"," Bad news comes in, we start, we start making levels."
"11401060","11401680"," Makes sense?"
"11404500","11406540"," I'm hyper aware of this right here. "
"11408620","11410220"," Some real sellers up in here."
"11412420","11416580"," This is looking really weak, I want you to know that okay, this is looking very like, toppy."
"11417960","11419600"," Very, very, very toppy in tomorrow. "
"11421460","11422700"," HYG is looking sickly."
"11424660","11426860"," This is good, this is constructive for TLT."
"11429420","11433440"," I'd like to see it at least come down to this 105 level, to be honest, it'd be nice to"
"11433440","11434460"," even see it come down here. "
"11435600","11438860"," This is where I'd really like to see it come down right in here somewhere."
"11440240","11444800"," You know that there's this little, there's some buyers in here, but you're good to see it TLT come"
"11444800","11446300"," down a little bit, maybe down here."
"11448540","11453040"," Anything really ugly news, that wouldn't shock me at all. "
"11461040","11462040"," Kind of back here."
"11464700","11467800"," We'll extend all this stuff because, well, we'll meet up with this."
"11470440","11471860"," This is good, constructive. "
"11473980","11478920"," I'd like to see it come back down here at least 100, maybe just the flat 100 could be a"
"11478920","11479520"," quick dip below."
"11482920","11486240"," Build some more support down here to make another leg higher."
"11487440","11488820"," Well, it's looking weak in a Wednesday. "
"11489940","11491680"," We can look at JankK if you want it to."
"11491980","11493160"," What's XL you doing today?"
"11493540","11495340"," Hello to they're all hiding."
"11495680","11496060"," Look at this. "
"11499020","11502440"," You know, this portfolio manager's trying to hide an XLU."
"11502680","11504840"," This is insane watching this."
"11505860","11506820"," This is not good. "
"11507600","11509820"," This is not a well-hedged market when you're seeing this nonsense."
"11512420","11513220"," It's insane."
"11516240","11516960"," It's like a boil. "
"11517340","11518320"," Oh my, look at boil."
"11519520","11520480"," Just vicious."
"11536510","11537910"," Ahhh, boil, man. "
"11538150","11539490"," Boils trying to hold on right here."
"11548020","11549340"," Put into gasket data."
"11549760","11553100"," Europe gas pipeline flows to Poland from German equals to zero. "

"11596630","11597270"," Let's see. "
"11598710","11599930"," Pushed it down, right?"
"11600410","11601790"," Pushed way down."
"11602930","11605690"," I got, where does it want to come back for some supporters down here?"
"11607830","11609190"," Like that yellow."
"11628970","11631270"," Uh, be careful in here too. "
"11633350","11634830"," Be careful with natural gas."
"11638530","11640650"," There's big giant push down right here, right?"
"11641050","11642870"," Big giant push down right here."
"11643870","11646310"," Big giant push down right here, right?"
"11647730","11649430"," And they're right back at it again. "
"11649430","11654650"," And we got this whole thing going on in here."
"11687910","11689190"," Man, I'll tell you what."
"11690410","11692550"," How far can a boil come down?"
"11693570","11694390"," Probably a lot. "
"11700160","11701820"," Tell you where they think boil's going."
"11702240","11702700"," $62."
"11703760","11706200"," Tell you where bowls think boil's going. "
"11707780","11711360"," Well, then I doubt you can see it in previous timeframes, right?"
"11712080","11713280"," You can see it right here."
"11714140","11715340"," Just smash."
"11716240","11718600"," Comes up, goes down, bam. "
"11719720","11725480"," So, yeah, I mean, like a smaller time frame, I can see where bowls are."
"11726200","11727640"," I can most certainly see."
"11730440","11735160"," Can most certainly see bowls saying, uh, sorry, cap, we're going. "
"11736540","11738460"," This is the price target up here."
"11740080","11740820"," This is Valhalla."
"11742640","11744180"," We'll make it green for right now. "
"11746920","11751120"," So you can you can tell that the bowls are like, no, no, no, no cap."
"11751340","11752040"," We're going here, bro."
"11753180","11753820"," We did it. "
"11753900","11755100"," We did it way back over there."
"11755160","11755820"," We're going to do it again."
"11756280","11758240"," Just trying to get some support down here. "
"11758980","11762300"," Gotta get some more bag holders in here so you can get up here."
"11762900","11767660"," If we do, if if oil does trade up there, I'm going to tell you, like, you start selling."
"11768620","11771060"," You get some other places, some scary spots above. "
"11772500","11773820"," You've got some harrow."
"11774080","11780510"," Let me, uh, there's a wild ride."
"11780730","11784430"," You know, like, all these trades like this are, these are some wild rides. "
"11788070","11789510"," I can see it right now."
"11789590","11793350"," I can see why you guys are so bullish on boil."
"11810930","11811870"," So far, man. "
"11812050","11818730"," I mean, so far, uh, bullish is, you know, consolidating, baby."
"11819050","11819750"," That's what it's doing."
"11820150","11822530"," It's just, it's just taking a breather. "
"11827260","11828640"," It's all it's doing right now."
"11828760","11831240"," And on a larger time frame, it's just in a breather right now."
"11831960","11832960"," It's just chilling. "
"11837620","11838620"," Some wild stuff."
"11838820","11842580"," Close the gap down here and then start to cement start, just start to smash an iron."
"11844860","11853620"," Shouldn't be, shouldn't be checking boil because, uh, gets by coming in for the retest again above. "
"11857800","11862220"," Saw that VIX could, the VIX had a little bit of a downward, but then it's looking to go higher."
"11862600","11865400"," So be careful up in here if the VIX turns around."
"11865660","11871020"," If you guys are going to show you how that would play out, you'd have a smash iron on spy"
"11871020","11871900"," here, right?"
"11872920","11878060"," And then, um, you'd be looking at the VIX. "
"11878500","11879500"," Where the fuck is the VIX again?"
"11882140","11886760"," This is why you should have all these, usually when I'm trading, I'll have these screeners open on"
"11886760","11887600"," a bunch of different monitors."
"11889220","11892680"," Uh, when I'm trading with you guys, hold on a second."
"11897180","11899140"," Right now, I don't, I want you guys to see that though. "
"11903980","11904560"," Let's see here."
"11910340","11911740"," See, let's see a little bit of this consolidation."
"11911740","11913500"," And then you get your leg up. "
"11920070","11921410"," Someone just made me some lunch."
"11922350","11923390"," Kind of impressed here."
"11924330","11925190"," I smell food. "
"11945680","11954060"," According to a statement, Italy's industry minister and EU's Bretton agree that the EU should drop"
"11954060","11958940"," the proposal on industry policy at the European level based challenges from China and the US."
"11959760","11962760"," They can break above, I don't, I don't not see."
"11963040","11966000"," I mean, we can, we can break above this level right here and easily tag above. "
"11966740","11969900"," You want to be a fair foot, you want to be watching book map above here."
"11970220","11972480"," So let me show you what my cursor, what I want to talk to you about here."
"11977250","11980630"," Keep your, see this current, you want to, you want to keep your eye, see how the book is thin"
"11980630","11980890"," here. "
"11981070","11981990"," There's no sellers up here."
"11982690","11986170"," You're going to be looking for this book to flash peaks like they are right now."
"11987010","11988330"," And this is selling into strength. "
"11988650","11989890"," So just be conscious of it."
"11990310","11993070"," You got another tag above here at, uh, at 4,000."
"11993730","11995070"," You can see 3399. "
"11996670","11999210"," But you want to keep an eye out for that tag."
"11999510","12005230"," And you might want to do is minus, uh, so off of, uh, three, uh, three, nine, six."
"12005410","12008810"," You want to do, uh, point three, or three, five off of nine, six. "
"12009430","12017070"," So, uh, when you're watching, um, when you're watching, uh, E S and then spy."
"12021560","12025200"," How'd you put your right around our one with a yellow bar above there?"
"12026400","12027060"," That's up here."
"12030180","12034100"," See those standing orders just pop in above at three, 39, 99, 4,000. "
"12045690","12046130"," Sweet."
"12047750","12048750"," Awesome sauce, Joe."
"12049490","12050210"," You're amazing, bro. "
"12054520","12055440"," You're amazing, brother."
"12056660","12057680"," I'm going to break out."
"12057860","12060780"," I'm going to break out a, uh, the last second here I'm going to get. "
"12078550","12080810"," Gonna get my, uh, trade nap open here."
"12092420","12095740"," You know, like one thing that I love about Tasty is you can switch between accounts."
"12097780","12113250"," Really fast, just squeezing"
"12113250","12120630"," all them bears is 263 contract, 260,000 contracts on 394, just fueling the fire hire right now. "
"12128670","12129810"," I love you, Joe."
"12130050","12130850"," Thank you very much, brother."
"12131390","12132170"," Appreciate it. "
"12138220","12138860"," Yeah."
"12139200","12142300"," So I was talking to, um, let me take a look."
"12143660","12153180"," I was speaking with, um, with the founder of book map the other day. "
"12153760","12160500"," And, uh, I think we're going to try to do, uh, just a class on book map, how to set"
"12160500","12163300"," it up, how to use it."
"12163520","12165860"," And then, uh, I think you might look at some of the tools and stuff."
"12166600","12170180"," And that should be coming, so I want you guys to know this too. "
"12170580","12171700"," Some of you guys know this."
"12171880","12172520"," Some of you might as might not."
"12173020","12177880"," But as soon as this week is over, the stock market's going to get very quiet. "
"12178380","12187970"," You're going to see a lot of, uh, uh, uh, stock market participants that you interact with will"
"12187970","12191390"," take some time off into the holiday season."
"12192270","12194150"," But you'll see the market get very quiet."
"12194150","12195270"," You're going to see the market. "
"12195650","12198910"," Also, you'll see, uh, mark, you'll see people like me not around."
"12199170","12201310"," They'll be like, I'm going on vacation for, for a week or two."
"12201590","12206310"," You'll see me here with you, uh, during this next couple weeks. "
"12206310","12211330"," And I'm hoping that in this time period that I have, uh, I'm able to put it together a book"
"12211330","12211890"," map class."
"12212750","12213750"," It's going to be free."
"12214250","12218770"," You'll have access to it and we'll step by step go through it. "
"12218910","12224030"," I was thinking of even turning it into a live stream so that you guys can set up whatever, whatever"
"12224030","12225090"," instance you have."
"12225090","12235090"," If you have a, um, an instance from, uh, thinkers are, um, I think a swim or if you have"
"12235090","12241370"," a standalone book map and we'll set up, uh, book map for you."
"12241430","12246910"," As a matter of fact, just stating that if you don't, if you can't afford book map, you should open"
"12246910","12254510"," yourself a thinker swim account, download a desktop version of Thinkorswim. "
"12256570","12263190"," If you are going to purchase a book map, the standalone, it has more features."
"12263890","12266150"," I would wait because I'll get you a deal on it, I think."
"12267510","12268810"," I love book map. "
"12269630","12270750"," It helps a ton."
"12274630","12280630"," So maybe just start, how about you just start with the Thinkorswim platform and then if I can work"
"12280630","12282850"," out this deal, I'll get you guys a code or something."
"12283550","12290210"," So you can save a whole bunch of money and we'll do a class and, uh, we'll look at different,"
"12290210","12293670"," uh, for our order book settings on the right. "
"12293850","12298330"," There's actually some really cool stuff you can look at on the right hand side of the book map."
"12298870","12300410"," Can set it up with a whole bunch of information."
"12306710","12308070"," So we will take a look at that. "
"12310830","12315530"," And when the market trades a little bit, like this isn't normal trading for the, for our stock"
"12315530","12324470"," market, so, um, there's a lot of people in this stream that we trade pretty consistently day in,"
"12324550","12324890"," day out."
"12326610","12329430"," Oftentimes I'll take multiple five, four or five trades in a day."
"12329790","12331650"," Uh, I'm not interested in this trade right now. "
"12333130","12337370"," I have, if you guys want to know I'm interested, you guys, we can talk about that right now."
"12338430","12340870"," Like, see, you can see how light the book is right now."
"12341110","12343650"," Normally you, you'd see so much more volume right now. "
"12343870","12345690"," So risky trading right now."
"12346030","12346510"," This can reverse."
"12349210","12352650"," This can reverse in any moment. "
"12353050","12354250"," It's why you know that."
"12355930","12357670"," Just blink of an eye, this can reverse."
"12361350","12371110"," So, the, uh, uh, which we"
"12371110","12373050"," just said, CV and A going to zero. "
"12375210","12378430"," Kept that, St. Cash, puts on Tesla, will level in time frame."
"12379330","12382530"," Everything looks kind of set up for some sort of river-based and IV crash and charts."
"12383490","12386110"," You just start breaking 39 hard yet, it doesn't break, then it goes up. "
"12386830","12389030"," Yeah, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not anti-going up from here."
"12390330","12393870"," I'm not a, I'm a, my, my thought on."
"12398390","12401710"," Let's take a, let's take a breather here and I want to show you something inspired, okay. "
"12402710","12405310"," Just want you guys to have some situational awareness here."
"12410680","12412740"," Some situational awareness here, okay."
"12413980","12415520"," I'm not anti-with the stock market going up. "
"12415600","12416740"," I just want you to be aware of that."
"12417900","12419380"," There are sellers here, okay."
"12420580","12421700"," Just land it down there. "
"12422080","12423160"," There's sellers right there."
"12423920","12427600"," And as we trade up here, they're going to be waiting for you."
"12428130","12428960"," Do you get my point?"
"12431860","12436040"," If you want to start getting bullish, you're a bull, right?"
"12436160","12440580"," I told you this morning before the program, you need to close above here. "
"12441500","12444080"," So we'll put these back in again so you can have them."
"12445120","12455340"," You want to get, you want to get all bullish, really want some kind"
"12455340","12456300"," of a close above here."
"12462160","12463040"," Does it make sense?"
"12463040","12468080"," I just want you to be aware, you're like situational awareness into what's happening right now and"
"12468080","12469420"," nothing's really changed, right?"
"12469480","12472980"," You're still pinned in 395, right?"
"12473120","12478160"," We sold down, bought a right backup pocket right in here for you for tomorrow. "
"12478420","12480380"," Remember this CPI, J-POW?"
"12481020","12482340"," Just be conscious of that."
"12482880","12486540"," You'll get the event vault, right?"
"12487260","12490100"," More than likely for CPI tomorrow, you're looking for a couple places."
"12490680","12492940"," I'll put these boxes right back in for you again. "
"12494920","12497540"," It's like 390 down here, somewhere down here."
"12500800","12502560"," You know they're buying it up down here, right?"
"12502920","12504280"," Somewhere down here, they're buying it up."
"12509090","12513810"," Like have some situational awareness of this buy sell. "
"12515590","12517310"," And you probably won't get up here."
"12517550","12524830"," Well, you have a chance to get up here, but you know, like that's bullish right there."
"12526610","12529810"," But like any of this can be sold at any time. "
"12530750","12533250"," These sellers are just waiting for you up here at that point."
"12533990","12536250"," Just waiting to swoop in and sell on you."
"12536350","12537490"," So just be conscious of that. "
"12537850","12539870"," Conscious of that heading into tomorrow."
"12541790","12543390"," Like how bullish is bullish."
"12543750","12546850"," This is kind of, you know, it can be bullish from the day or, but just know that they're just"
"12546850","12547950"," fucking there waiting for you. "
"12550980","12554840"," I think I posted something like this this morning, right?"
"12554980","12561460"," Did I post something like this on I post the chart with this this morning and said, I think I"
"12561460","12566300"," said R1 and then I said watch those they'll trade it to R2 just to just to smoke."
"12568280","12570340"," Smoke any bearishness in tomorrow."
"12570940","12574420"," I think I posted that on Twitter this morning. "
"12580790","12583610"," Yeah, Chase, I'm not saying that's not the case."
"12583610","12587230"," What I'm saying to you is I agree with you, Chase, but I'm saying to you that you probably do"
"12587230","12589850"," reversion again into J-POW."
"12591810","12594070"," So just like just like the bears. "
"12594130","12595850"," It's away from the top of the hour."
"12596090","12596810"," Remember this right there?"
"12596870","12599890"," You can sell $32 billion in 10-year notes."
"12600370","12604990"," Private to cover of two to 23 with a prior high yield of four spot one, four percent. "
"12605550","12611130"," Additionally, the Fed is due to sell, sorry, the US due to sell $54 billion in three month bills."
"12611690","12616950"," Private to cover there of two to 67 with the prior high yield of four spot two, seven percent."
"12617570","12620930"," So a quick note ahead of the 10-year notes auction here. "
"12621310","12627030"," So noting against its peers, the sevens, 10s and 30s fly is cheaper over the past month, which may"
"12627030","12628310"," boost relative value appeal."
"12628750","12628930"," Nice."
"12629010","12632710"," It remains 10 basis points off of its year to date high near zero basis points. "
"12633470","12638550"," So the auction faces significant event risks from the November CPI data due tomorrow and the Fed"
"12638550","12640550"," rate decision due on Wednesday as well."
"12641150","12647050"," Also noting the weekly CFTC futures positioning data, which shows the speculators were net short"
"12647050","12653670"," around 369,000 10-year note contracts and net short 107,000 ultra 10-year contracts."
"12654350","12655930"," Again, a possible source of covering demand. "
"12657430","12662990"," So this moved down into Friday and you know like normally you'd be like I'm chasing that right down"
"12662990","12663650"," that hole on a Monday."
"12664350","12668850"," But then on of course over the weekend, they chapped you right."
"12668850","12678430"," And the only way is there is a set of that reversion, that mean reversion back would be you know"
"12678430","12679710"," you get real bullish in here. "
"12680670","12686090"," It's also just noting the primary dealers positions here in the seven to 11 year sector that"
"12686090","12691330"," weren't long at 980 million dollars in the week ending November 30th."
"12691330","12695450"," That's versus the three spot four billion dollars average net short over the past year."
"12696610","12704220"," And you get this move up into the close and you start saying I want to say it here. "
"12707360","12712100"," Get this nice consolidation, it doesn't break down, make this move higher, boom."
"12712920","12714800"," You're like cranking up into the bell right here."
"12716260","12721760"," And it's just like the bears on Friday and you're like Yahoo and they just start selling futures"
"12723320","12725140"," down into a decision right here. "
"12726320","12728600"," And then does it go up or does it go down right?"
"12729540","12730420"," Does that make sense?"
"12731240","12735940"," You'll have hair like news and they'll say like there's no way they were put there pumping it up or"
"12735940","12738280"," even it goes up and then it just comes right back down into Wednesday."
"12739160","12745940"," Just be honest and just be careful on how we can trade next two days."
"12747240","12750340"," Just be careful please love a peek be careful. "
"12762900","12763760"," That's what it is."
"12763920","12766700"," I'm telling you last week we were watching it."
"12766800","12768040"," We were like we were in here last week. "
"12768160","12774360"," We were like we were like man under any under any other circumstance."
"12777260","12783120"," Like so many setups should have worked out for like 30 like 50 50 percent retracement."
"12783300","12785260"," No problem 70 percent retracement. "
"12785400","12785600"," No problem."
"12786240","12792360"," Sell it down and down the hole for another 70 points down like either side of that trade should"
"12792360","12795560"," have printed like back and forth like three or four times and they were just like nope."
"12799100","12801340"," So you're just like and take your money and run. "
"12802880","12804320"," Thank you for the free money."
"12804820","12805980"," I'm not giving any of it back."
"12806700","12811040"," And I know some people closed yesterday or on Friday and some people did not. "
"12811580","12815340"," Some people left some on but I know there were a lot of I know there were a lot of"
"12815340","12818660"," traders that were who went right down that hole under the bell."
"12818780","12819540"," I know they did."
"12821760","12828940"," Um I that's my only fear up in here is like you can you can trade this up. "
"12829520","12832300"," What I'm saying is he can start drinking that Kool-Aid."
"12833260","12836300"," I'll be watching out man because that Kool-Aid becomes intoxicating."
"12836980","12841080"," You know the trader you're just like whoa doesn't matter what's up or down. "
"12841200","12843920"," You're just you're in you're in so just be careful."
"12845200","12849360"," You know just be careful just be careful this is meant for that."
"12849860","12852740"," If these events are meant for you to drink the Kool-Aid. "
"12858480","12859460"," No I'm still in it."
"12860160","12863820"," I got I got some of it but I'm hoping to get rid of the last of it."
"12864700","12869920"," If I can get rid of it the CPI or in the event I still have some hedge on. "
"12870820","12877080"," I have no interest zero to hold the rest of it past the event."
"12878500","12881280"," I'd rather re-enter after re-pricing."
"12885550","12886870"," I'm still in a little bit. "
"12887990","12890210"," Kind of a little tiny bit left and I'm almost out."
"12893630","12895790"," If I've been as now to the top of the hour."
"12895990","12896330"," Yeah you're welcome. "
"12896390","12901430"," The US is due to sell 32 billion dollars in 10-year notes for the private cover of 2 to"

"12944170","12944810"," interested in. "
"12944810","12950290"," Something outside the money slightly and see if it's getting a premium kick."
"12952410","12954150"," You can check like a month out from now."
"12954930","12955690"," I wouldn't do a month. "
"12956230","12960130"," I would check like if you're just looking at this track."
"12960310","12962830"," I would check like something end of the month."
"12963790","12967430"," Maybe January 15th calls that are in the money or slightly outside the money. "
"12967950","12973930"," If you start seeing premium build in those the dealers could be could be pricing those for for a"
"12973930","12974150"," buy."

"22376080","22376920"," There was no trap."
"22377140","22379380"," The moment that you break above, you take the trade higher."
"22379620","22381780"," This is the meat of the trade and where all the money is to be made. "
"22382700","22385140"," This is absolutely not where you want to take the trade ever."
"22387900","22389140"," But you probably know that."
"22389780","22392880"," Or you have a $500 account that you replace on Friday with a new paycheck. "
"22393920","22395660"," That's one of the other I guarantee it."
"22399500","22400140"," Peacore, baby."
"22404070","22404530"," That's right. "
"22404650","22405850"," We're just talking about it off stream."

"22452620","22454160"," I'm like looking at it going, man, that shit looks weak."
"22454920","22455200"," Let's see. "
"22455280","22456280"," It's going to bleed right off."

"22468210","22469350"," And look at that rip."
"22469870","22478470"," Look at that squeeze higher just dragging straight up north right here on, uh, an HYG. "
"22480030","22482450"," Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous squeeze on HYG."

"22492930","22495510"," You're also seeing support now on spy."
"22496510","22499130"," Right here. "
"22500210","22501670"," We have meat from this stuff here."
"22505510","22509830"," Just a beautiful squeeze higher on, on HYG."
"22510110","22511510"," We'll take a look at J&K next. "

"22520090","22520850"," Well, I'm going to gone. "
"22521390","22522010"," Well, I'm gone."
"22523170","22527850"," Look at J&K moving averages all underneath it on the 15 minute."
"22530560","22531380"," Just look at that. "
"22531560","22533360"," I want to do a huge blast up."
"22534640","22538080"," Came into some resistance here, but I'm telling you this gorgeous."
"22539460","22541480"," Pulls in control of bonds right now. "
"22541540","22543380"," They must know something that we don't know, right?"
"22547740","22548660"," Close that out."
"22554590","22555550"," Just gorgeous."

"22570830","22571590"," See here. "
"22574430","22577090"," And just scream right through top of the top of the key."
"22577570","22581070"," Remember, if you get a close above 400 today, it's very bullish."
"22582150","22584790"," The bulls are back in charge all of a sudden. "
"22585090","22588830"," Not only are they back in charge, but they're back in charge of some conviction up here."
"22589650","22593850"," If you're looking, if you're looking on the Spy SPX, it doesn't really matter."

"22644400","22645360"," Give me a second here in the background. "
"22663460","22664800"," Take a look at it on SPX."

"22722700","22724420"," We'll take a look at SPX."
"22727920","22733120"," The bulls definitely want to take a look at this because we're breaking through. "
"22734260","22736700"," I want to show you guys this real quick if it can."
"22746280","22748220"," I'm just going to bring this over real quick for you."
"22749400","22751120"," Just taking a look at SPX. "

"22772090","22772490"," time. "
"22773110","22776370"," You're talking about a move higher into 404 here."
"22776910","22780350"," This could smash higher right now, easily smash higher."
"22781390","22783730"," And then above that you've got the next level up here. "
"22783850","22785830"," This is for ten or so."
"22786870","22790170"," This could lead to some big squeezing in the market."
"22790950","22795470"," And then of course back here you've got much, much, much stuff back here. "
"22796070","22797950"," That's your 430 above over here."
"22797950","22806490"," So bulls have some conviction now without a doubt, at least on SPX that's showing a reversal for"
"22806490","22808130"," the bulls is forming up currently."
"22812530","22814990"," So bulls want to close above this 400. "
"22815710","22817750"," This would be a conviction trade up here."
"22818150","22822870"," If they take it to the key, you can't give it to the bulls, but it looks really good."
"22830650","22832670"," This is all in the bulls court right now. "
"22835380","22837620"," All in the bulls court, congratulations bulls."
"22840140","22842480"," Congratulations short, or short squeezing right here."
"22843400","22846140"," Now I want to know if this is, well we know this is low volume. "
"22846900","22850900"," I know this is all short squeezing, not, well maybe it is, I haven't looked."
"22852760","22855300"," It's actually some pretty serious buying going on the background."
"22856300","22858240"," I've got some high volume shit right there, brah. "
"22859080","22860380"," You can see it on the book."
"22871320","22872740"," Your buying puts right here."
"22874940","22876500"," Yeah, I've been in a trade all day long. "
"22877820","22882980"," Like right in here, like right in here I left the stream."
"22883760","22885440"," Somewhere right in here I left the stream."
"22886740","22887580"," Right in here. "
"22888120","22889420"," And then I just came up and popped over."
"22890180","22892220"," But this is where the, this is where the trade was right here."
"22893300","22895700"," That was the move, that was a kick ass trade right there. "
"22896680","22899520"," No failure on the flag broke through the flag."
"22899800","22901980"," Bulls took charge right here."
"22902100","22902660"," This was red. "
"22903340","22906500"," The moment that they broke above this red bar right here."
"22906960","22908960"," Bulls took right over and just slammed it home."
"22915000","22916260"," Excellent trade for bulls. "
"22919290","22921230"," I'm still holding Estau right now."
"22922830","22925390"," I still have a small position now Estau."
"22925590","22926990"," I'm afraid to look at it right now. "
"22927110","22928590"," I know I'm getting hammered in it."
"22929190","22933110"," I originally bought in at about two forty nine and I haven't looked."
"22933930","22937150"," Those trades I don't like looking at them because the swings are wild. "
"22937930","22939690"," If you look at the dial the past few days."
"22940610","22945110"," It's been it's been it's been like up fucking a hundred points down a hundred fucking points 300"
"22945110","22946430"," points up 300 points down."
"22947030","22949130"," So I try not to look at it. "
"22955750","22960310"," You don't want to see this one right here break right about here."
"22963690","22967070"," You don't want to see this break right after break you're going to you're going to start slamming"
"22967070","22967850"," down levels here."
"22968830","22970990"," Get a little bit of curl inside VWAP right now. "
"22971610","22973590"," Little bit of weakness in the mark with the VWAP roll over."
"22979550","22981630"," Bulls really want to get this close up here."
"22982490","22984690"," Bulls can't get this close up here it means nothing. "
"22985270","22989150"," None of this means anything if bulls can't get up here and close up high and strong."
"22997090","22998330"," Yeah, I don't want to look at it."
"22999170","23002170"," But those positions like that you don't look at them every day. "
"23003170","23007030"," I took some off the other day and I've taken some off one time."
"23009850","23011210"," But I'm still in that position."
"23013290","23019510"," That positions for March to so not my intraday moves intraday moves like this mean nothing to me. "
"23032240","23034500"," Gone for like I'm gone for like the goal."
"23034500","23036200"," How long was this right here?"
"23036340","23039220"," No, this is where it started to break out right here."
"23041780","23042620"," This is where the bull. "
"23042800","23044120"," Oh, this is where the bear flag was right."
"23044300","23045180"," Oh, you guys can't see this alone."
"23048230","23050310"," Just nice beautiful bear flag right here. "
"23050370","23051750"," Yesterday we had a failure in here."
"23051970","23055050"," Nice beautiful bear flag in here."
"23055150","23057030"," Yesterday we had a failure right in here early. "
"23057290","23059690"," We had this is red right the moment they broke above it."
"23061670","23062550"," It was off to the races."
"23064150","23066970"," The moment shorts broke right here. "
"23067070","23067470"," That was it."
"23067650","23069670"," It was turn around and start running."
"23071690","23073290"," Great trade for bulls in here. "
"23073910","23075690"," This is all not nasty in here."
"23076750","23080130"," But this trade above was the trade above was sexy."
"23084260","23085200"," Absolutely sexy. "
"23090410","23092270"," Wish I was here because it would have been screaming."
"23093710","23097150"," Normally I'm in here screaming when we once we start breaking above stuff like this."
"23097810","23098990"," You know it's going higher. "
"23099170","23100210"," There's no or limit."
"23100390","23101770"," What's your break above this stuff right here?"
"23102070","23103090"," You know you're going higher."
"23103290","23105050"," There's no other way about it. "
"23107050","23108310"," It just starts squeezing."
"23112030","23113910"," Yeah, it's like at least one day a week."
"23114090","23116090"," I go on a break and I come back and some shit's happened. "
"23116550","23117810"," At least one day a week."
"23120130","23121490"," At least one day a week."
"23121550","23122150"," I'm like I'm right back. "
"23123370","23125130"," It's usually because we're doing this bullshit."
"23125130","23127890"," We're just like side side side and I'm like fuck it."
"23127950","23128590"," I'm going to take a piss. "
"23131410","23132750"," The move gets paid."
"23138420","23139800"," Watch the HYG right now."
"23139840","23140860"," It's trying to stay above water. "
"23143860","23145880"," HYG is trying to hold its ground here."
"23149820","23152080"," Someone was asking about the VIX earlier right?"
"23152600","23154020"," VIX just keeps climbing right?"
"23154360","23158280"," VIX is just incantango just climbing with spy climbing right now."
"23158900","23165220"," It continues to go up and while the spy goes up right. "
"23167690","23171530"," It's kind of interesting at this point that we haven't closed or we're not above 400 right?"
"23173270","23176170"," The 400 is like a key level for bulls to retake."
"23177010","23178850"," It opens up so many doors above."
"23180010","23181030"," Big doors right?"
"23181370","23181990"," 50 point moves. "
"23182310","23184850"," Each one's like 40 points, 50 points, 30 points."
"23186050","23189290"," Big big thing for bulls to take over up here if they can't."
"23189510","23191070"," If they can't, you know what this is. "
"23191230","23193150"," This is the same as Friday for the bears."
"23193730","23196390"," Chase the hole and then they slam it back down."
"23196390","23200210"," So you take your money and run in this trade. "
"23201190","23205010"," You can get back into this trade for more push up into the bell."
"23205810","23206990"," Not against that trip."
"23207210","23208930"," So far bulls are still in charge over here. "
"23209570","23212250"," So it's not like this trade isn't dead just yet."
"23213310","23219050"," Have it just be aware that if you are in this trade higher that you'd want to take profit into"
"23219050","23219810"," the bell on it."
"23220810","23223990"," I said that on Friday to the bears and we'll say it to the bulls today. "
"23235780","23237840"," I don't know if it's anticipation of cooler."
"23238320","23239440"," There's a couple of things at play."
"23240240","23242980"," You know, you'll hear that you'll hear different comments on this. "
"23243120","23245920"," You'll hear that shorts just want better positioning."
"23247260","23251220"," My thesis is still that CPI doesn't really matter unless someone knows something."
"23252640","23255920"," This can just be people that have been short for some time period. "
"23256520","23262900"," Removing hedges and shorts for CPI so they don't want to lose the, they don't want to lose the ball"
"23262900","23263580"," in that event."
"23263580","23265100"," And then."
"23266120","23267080"," Into that event. "
"23268220","23269500"," There's a trap here."
"23269860","23273220"," So this is originally starting as a trap for bulls right here, right?"
"23273800","23279200"," And the moment that you trade higher, you've got bears coming in trying to short this down buying"
"23279200","23279540"," puts."
"23280040","23285140"," The moment you go higher like this, they have to close and then go or even keep them open and"
"23285140","23287000"," then go long to make it up with the difference. "
"23287000","23289280"," So you get a zombie, a zombie bear, right?"
"23289440","23293400"," They have to end up taking the long position so that they don't lose money here."
"23297100","23299880"," You got repositioning for CPI as well tomorrow."
"23300100","23302240"," If you're going to take assurance, CPI always want to take it up high. "
"23303200","23305260"," So you'd have all those arguments from the bear side as well."
"23305740","23306900"," You should know those as a bull."
"23309460","23314180"," And if you want to see that thesis get destroyed, you want to see the close higher than 400. "
"23317750","23319930"," You want to see this, this close up here."
"23321350","23323490"," You can see this in the inverse on Friday, right?"
"23324090","23324990"," Inverse on Friday."
"23325950","23329310"," The bears got like right to where they wanted to make it right here. "
"23330230","23336990"," But they didn't get the, they didn't get the, they might have gotten below where the buyers were."
"23337730","23339850"," You can see it got scooped right there in the inverse."
"23340090","23342390"," If they'd flipped the screen over, they came right. "
"23342510","23345690"," The computer's came right back and bought it back up so it didn't slip through the cracks."
"23347630","23349230"," And we saw that all last week as well."
"23355050","23357610"," Very productive for, for bulls for sure. "
"23358310","23361090"," Bulls want to convince and close here into the close."
"23368880","23373160"," I thought initially it was short covering, but you can see, it might be a mix of short covering."
"23373360","23375460"," The volume right now is out of, out of control. "
"23376140","23378300"," If you look down on the book map over here, right?"
"23379820","23382300"," You look down the bottom right hand side over here."
"23383040","23384900"," This is cumulative buyers and sellers."
"23385440","23387680"," And the volume is just monstrous. "
"23388820","23392460"," Joe and I were talking about some, so the reason I was, well, not the reason I didn't take a"
"23392460","23392900"," break, but."
"23392920","23396600"," Imbalance currently sitting at 300 million to the south side."
"23396700","23398700"," Just waiting for the final orders before we call it. "
"23399500","23400140"," Some salt."
"23402340","23403980"," I didn't know it was already three o'clock."
"23404120","23404920"," I thought it was two o'clock. "
"23405480","23409360"," So close imbalance sitting at 410 million to the south side."
"23410080","23414220"," There's this background discussion going on right now amongst young people."
"23414760","23416680"," I'll leave you with this as we head into the bell. "

"23433600","23435700"," But a whole hang tight here."
"23435840","23436760"," We'll talk about this into the bell. "
"23436900","23437560"," We got 10 minutes left."
"23439340","23439980"," So."
"23441420","23443540"," If you're, if you're a tech bro, right?"
"23444100","23449340"," There's a discussion going on right now amongst college tech students, computer science students. "
"23451560","23455120"," And some of them are trying to call this the bootstrap."
"23458080","23458720"," Tech."
"23460180","23461420"," What are they calling it?"
"23462320","23467060"," I think it's called the bootstrap tech recession or something. "
"23469680","23471420"," And I'll find out the name again."
"23471720","23472480"," I'll look right now."
"23475990","23479570"," It's called the bootstrap bubble bootstrap tech bubble. "
"23480650","23486030"," And what these, these young kids are, so you want to take young kids seriously because sometimes"
"23486030","23488210"," they can be a bell weather for the future, right?"
"23488650","23490890"," Find out your kid is on tiktok when it was nothing."
"23491470","23492850"," And then tiktok becomes huge, right?"
"23494730","23502230"," So they're these young tech bros and they're talking about how there used to be a pipeline for"
"23502230","23502450"," them."
"23502550","23507530"," They could get a degree and they would send resumes out to all these big tech companies and"
"23507530","23508370"," everyone got a job. "
"23508490","23508930"," It didn't matter."
"23512350","23513630"," And it was a given."
"23513930","23516470"," You'd get paid X amount of dollars job for life. "
"23516470","23517090"," Everything is great."
"23517810","23520170"," Well, all these tech bros that are coming out of college right now."
"23522150","23523910"," Their future is not guaranteed. "
"23524510","23531050"," They're hyper afraid of a tech recession in 2023 with big tech companies."
"23531870","23537330"," And they won't be guaranteed a job at these or at least they're perceiving that."
"23538190","23543410"," We know that big tech companies would rather fire older workers and pick up young tech workers were"
"23543410","23545610"," cheap, but they're scared anyways. "
"23546310","23550950"," And so the job offers that they're getting right now from large companies like Microsoft, Apple,"
"23551110","23553350"," Amazon, Tesla, anybody."
"23554370","23559170"," Some of the some of these young kids are passing on these jobs and they're calling it like the"
"23559170","23563310"," bootstrap tech recession of some kind."
"23563470","23568810"," And what they're doing is basically they're saying if I'm if I'm if there's a fear that I have that"
"23568810","23571790"," I make it laid off or a slowdown of a company. "
"23572670","23581110"," And these companies, maybe I should be taking more risk with my own startup or smaller company."
"23583430","23588210"," Into 2023, so you might start seeing graduates like you might see a class of graduates."
"23590390","23599110"," In these next last year, this year, next year, you might see this next wave of tech companies. "
"23600790","23609770"," That are on par with the apples and the Teslas and all these all these companies have done well for"
"23609770","23610350"," the past decade."
"23610710","23618190"," Let's say two decades for some of the companies that survived crashes and we should be looking for"
"23618190","23619970"," these kids and where they're going, what they're doing."
"23622130","23626190"," They're not going to put their eggs into the basket of one of these large tech tech companies. "
"23627370","23628950"," So I sent him a document."
"23629390","23633070"," It's like a it's like a short film that was made by a by I think it's a Columbia kid"
"23633070","23638310"," from Columbia University on this topic called a bootstrap bubble."
"23638770","23640210"," You can find it on YouTube. "
"23640270","23641030"," It has no views."
"23641810","23643730"," I think it has 400 views right now."
"23643730","23647210"," It had like 350 views a couple days ago. "
"23647590","23652250"," And when I first watched it, you could, you know, if you're watching it had, you know, like a young"
"23652250","23653170"," person made the movie."
"23653170","23655470"," So, you know, it has its flaws."
"23655510","23656390"," They're not film students. "
"23657150","23659370"," I think that they're tech rose like young tech guys."
"23659670","23661470"," And it's worth it's worth watching."
"23666000","23669460"," So that the pipeline for these kids are is breaking right now. "
"23677470","23681930"," Yeah, there's so the idea would be that maybe you'd be tracking some of these kids or some of these"
"23681930","23683670"," new tech firms that are startups now."
"23684530","23685810"," In case they ever IPO."
"23691600","23695600"," There might be a paradigm shift, I guess, where and they talk about in this movie. "
"23696780","23701840"," Where it was normal for most kids to just immediately get in the pipeline to these companies and"
"23701840","23705640"," that they're that there's a real wave of these kids that are not doing that right now."
"23706160","23708740"," Still squeezing higher retesting the highs before."
"23710540","23714640"," Now trading 398.50 trying to get a new high into the bell right now. "
"23723760","23728000"," You're going to post the link to the YouTube video for you guys so you can have it and watch"
"23728000","23728780"," it in your own time."

"23732940","23739400"," Give me a second here and I'll get you a link and I'll post it in. "
"23740760","23745020"," It's got no views, but this is the kind of stuff you try to watch."
"23747060","23750160"," This is the kind of stuff that you try to watch when the one else is paying attention."
"23752460","23754120"," And here, give me a second here. "
"23756220","23759300"," And I'll post it the link to it inside the chat."
"23760040","23760820"," I don't know these kids."
"23761060","23761860"," I don't know anything about them. "
