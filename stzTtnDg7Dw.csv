"stzTtnDg7Dw","0","6000"," Hey traders, this is Captain Jim James."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","6000","11360"," If you're a new trader, if you're a trader that gets trapped in stocks or plays, if you're"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","11360","18160"," a losing trader or you just want to get back to the basics, this video might be for you."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","18160","22480"," Too often I see traders that are trapped, to be honest."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","22480","24400"," These are new and older traders."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","24400","33700"," This isn't just a small percentage of the traders that I talk to, it's a fair percentage."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","33700","34700"," The stats don't lie."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","34700","44760"," Most of the stats say that as low as 10% actually win over time."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","44760","47920"," If you're here to make money, if you're in the stock market to make money, if you like"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","47920","53720"," GME and you want GME to go up, there are ways to trade it and there are ways for you"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","53720","57160"," to always make money while trying to trade it."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","57160","61440"," So we're just going to start here on Spy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","61440","66240"," You can make sure that you get yourself a platform that has charts."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","66240","70280"," Robinhood, you can make your trades there and I have made trades on Robinhood but I never"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","70280","72080"," use it for charts."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","72080","74840"," This is Webull, it's free."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","74840","86400"," It's almost as fast as the high-end brokerages, light speed, it's just almost as fast as light"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","86400","87400"," speed and it's free."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","87400","90000"," It's real-time market data."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","90000","92600"," So I'm going to use this one here."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","92600","97720"," The key is to make sure that your brokerage or whatever charting app you're using has"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","97720","104400"," actual charts with price alerts that you can be emailed or texted."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","104400","108840"," And Webull does offer that."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","108840","112040"," And one more first note."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","112040","117200"," There was a moment when I began trading where there was, in the beginning of my trading,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","117200","125200"," I was making a lot of money, lots and eventually I started to lose a lot of money, upwards"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","125200","134600"," of $100,000 trades, $35,000 trades and I would stay in them and lose all of that money."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","134600","142840"," And I was so upset with myself that I stopped trading for a while and what I had to do was"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","142840","145760"," stop trading and come back to the basics."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","145760","151320"," And this is pretty much it, what I'm going to show you here is coming back to the basics."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","151320","159040"," And I exited all of my positions in my investments, exited all of my options and I came back"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","159040","160480"," to the basics."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","160480","162960"," So let's look at them."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","162960","166080"," And this is the spy here in front of you."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","166080","174040"," If you were to just start with this index, it tends to go in one direction over a lot"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","174040","175040"," of time."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","175200","182360"," Now it does sometimes go down over time, but it will stay in that trend for a period of"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","182360","183360"," time."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","183360","188960"," And you can still play that trend down on the up and down side."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","188960","196200"," But you want to find an ETF with high liquidity, many expiration dates, trends in one direction"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","196200","202600"," and it goes up and down a lot within that one long time trend."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","202640","206880"," And I always recommend the spy, especially to a new trader."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","206880","212360"," If you look at this chart here, this is a one year chart, and if you were to just put"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","212360","223920"," a major support trend line here over the course of the past year, you're going to see one,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","223920","231960"," two, almost three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","231960","235560"," Let's say seven times."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","235560","241320"," If you had just bought this trend line seven times this year with a bull debit call spread,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","241320","248040"," which are easy to learn how to do, you would have made, if you had done it with 20 points"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","248040","259320"," outside of the money or 200 ticks, you would have made anywhere from 1,100 or 1,000%, 2,000,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","259960","262760"," depending upon the risk that you wanted to take."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","262760","267320"," You could just play this chart, this spy chart, this year, and you wouldn't have to"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","267320","269600"," play any other stock."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","269600","274840"," You could close everything that you have out there right now and just play spy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","274840","277880"," And seven times you would have won."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","277880","278880"," You wouldn't have even lost."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","278880","281680"," You would have just won seven straight in a row."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","281680","288000"," And if there was a major trend shift in spy, and you're only betting 10 to 30% of your"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","288040","293000"," money, you would have lost once out of those seven times."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","293000","303960"," So you're talking 7 to 14,000, 7,000 to 7 to 14,000%, depending on how you played it."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","303960","309760"," And you might have lost another 1,000, 2,000% on an actual trend reversal."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","309760","315800"," Had you even lost 500 or a thousand, excuse me, 5,000%, you'd still be up 10,000 in one"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","315800","316800"," year."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","316800","317800"," You create wealth."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","317800","321040"," Now, how you lose that wealth is to do what I do."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","321040","325400"," You day trade, you swing trade, you trade, you know, monthlies."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","325400","326400"," And you get greedy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","326400","331720"," But this is really the chart that you need to be making money to fund your misadventures,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","331720","333480"," because this one is consistent."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","333480","343600"," This is like a major trend support here, you know, and then you draw in a major resistance."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","343600","345040"," We already see that up here, right?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","345040","351680"," You can see that major resistance, and you could even bring it lower."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","351680","355800"," Let's say if you would have started it back here, and that's where that resistance is,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","355800","357800"," the whole year."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","357800","360200"," You see that?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","360200","368120"," And you could draw minor support and resistances as well for confirmation if you do actually"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","368120","369840"," want to enter these trades."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","370840","377120"," You know, and you probably would have started this one somewhere in here."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","377120","380600"," This line has been respected for the entire year."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","380600","382800"," The same would go for tops as well."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","382800","391000"," If you already know that the tops are coming, you're probably somewhere in here."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","391000","395600"," You know, so are you going long here, or are you going short here?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","395600","399360"," When people say that, hey, are you going long?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","399360","404760"," People know when to go long and when to go short."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","404760","406320"," You can play both of these."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","406320","413800"," The bear case is less consistent than the bull case, and it's not as frequent as the"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","413800","415640"," bull case."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","415640","421560"," You can see here on an upward trend over time, the bear case doesn't work."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","421560","427360"," If this was in reverse and we were in a bear trend down, a bear market, you would say the"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","427360","434240"," same thing in the inverse that the easier money would be on the downside."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","434240","440920"," So the bull case does work at this time it works."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","440920","443520"," So anyway, right now, this is where we are."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","443520","446760"," You know, would you go long here, and the answer is no."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","446760","447760"," Did I go long right here?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","447760","451600"," I did, and I posted about it on Twitter, and I had a lot of people follow me on those"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","451600","452600"," plays."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","453080","458960"," Would this put 20 or 200 handles on the board this run?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","458960","460600"," Do I need to get 450?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","460600","461600"," No."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","461600","467120"," Do most other successful traders, small hedge funds, large banks need to get the other 10?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","467120","468760"," Some do."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","468760","473840"," Some are the ones that know that they can sell the market, but we're just retail traders"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","473840","476000"," regular Joe in the street."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","476000","478280"," This is enough for me to get my fill."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","478280","479600"," This took, how long?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","479600","483720"," This took 618 to 713."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","483720","490920"," So if you're placing month or two month out, slightly outside, if you're placing, let's"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","490920","496480"," say here at 421 is where it tagged, and you're just to buy this line right here, knowing"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","496480","502040"," we're getting up there, you would have bought 438, 437, 438 debit call spreads, and you got"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","502040","504080"," paid."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","504080","507640"," And now wherever we are in this area, I know eventually this is coming down."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","507640","510800"," It's just a matter of timing when it comes down, right?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","510800","516040"," And even if I wanted to wait, I could wait until it comes back down to get back in again."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","516040","518240"," And I already know that we're at the end of summer."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","518240","522960"," We already know that September and October are traditionally down months for the stock"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","522960","524460"," market."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","524460","530680"," So I could go short here, put a two or three month out, put spread option out here, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","530680","534200"," I guarantee at some point that that thing's going to print."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","534200","539000"," And if I put it somewhere along this line, a month or two out, let's say I put it right"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","539000","544920"," here at just 440, right, that's dated two, three months out, I'm telling you, that thing"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","544920","546840"," is going to print eventually."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","546840","547840"," No matter what."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","547840","551440"," No matter what, what if I'm day trading, I could be still, we could still be going up"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","551440","558320"," and I could day trade in this long and still get paid on the way down in the future."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","558320","559360"," So this is the money maker."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","559360","561360"," This is where you make your money, the spy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","561360","563160"," You could make it an SPX."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","563160","564400"," You could make it an ES."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","564400","566080"," I choose the spy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","566080","572640"," You pick your poison, but one of these right here, one of these three SPX spy or ES is"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","572640","574240"," going to do it for you."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","574240","576560"," And that's how you stay in this game."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","576560","582000"," The second thing that you would do is you're going to find a favorite stock that you play."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","582000","584400"," Sometimes these ETFs will go sideways."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","584400","589960"," They consolidate for days, weeks, and other stocks will be running and you're like, hey,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","589960","591640"," I want to go play Tesla right now."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","591640","592880"," I want to go play Apple right now."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","592880","594760"," I want to go play Amazon."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","594760","599320"," What you do is you trade one of those stocks consistently over the course of time, three"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","599320","605200"," months, six months a year, and you move from the big caps that are still high liquidity"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","605200","609440"," that everyone knows and you play those stocks for a determined period of time so you can"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","609440","611680"," get to know the ins and outs of them."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","611680","616320"," And there are some that people favored to trade regularly."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","616320","622600"," And when you start to trade more than a few, you were able to jump off of spy on a sideways"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","622600","627760"," week, let's say, and go trade Facebook because you know how it trades or you trade spot Apple"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","627760","630240"," because you know how it trades."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","630240","634440"," One of the popular ones is Amazon."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","634440","640360"," So if we take a look at Amazon, it's known for trading sideways, right?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","640360","642880"," Trade sideways for almost an entire year."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","642880","651440"," So this year, had you put a major support line here, and if you put another one a little"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","651440","666360"," bit tighter up here somewhere, let's say you put one right here, put one in the high range"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","666360","673440"," right here, and you could set an alert, you can right click on this one, I think this"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","673440","681960"," is a credit alert in Webull, and it's price below, and I save it, oh no, price above."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","681960","687920"," So this one's supposed to be price above, credit alert, it's price above, and this one"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","687920","691800"," here you do credit alert for price below, I don't know if I did those right, but you"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","691800","696840"," get in the gist, right?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","696840","703440"," So if you have a price below here and a price above here, I'll get an email or text saying"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","703440","704800"," we're in this zone."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","704800","714360"," So this whole year, I would have been alerted here, one, two, three, four times to make"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","714360","716400"," this run here."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","716400","722240"," Now we're looking like, Amazon's looking like it's heading up into a new trading range,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","722240","726880"," ER world aside, if it does head into a new trading range, I wouldn't trade this at all"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","726880","731960"," or play this, because I'd already made my money four times this year, and you can continue"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","731960","735920"," to add these big caps in here, you do this for Amazon, you do this for Apple, you do"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","735920","742840"," this for Facebook, and you pick one at a time, and you play them on weeklies, dailies while"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","742840","744480"," you're inside of this."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","744480","747920"," If you buy this, if you were to buy this right here, you know you can also come in,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","747920","752920"," you buy the spreads, and then you know that inside of this you can play day trades, weekly"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","752920","758400"," trades, and capture even more profit."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","758400","759400"," So you've got that down."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","759400","763960"," Now you're playing the spy, they're funding your misadventures, then you've got individual"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","763960","771440"," stocks that you can move out of spy and play on weeklies and dailies and on some more spreads,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","771440","776200"," taking on a little bit more risk with these trades here, and then let's say you're like"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","776200","784160"," hey, I want to play GME, I want to play AMC, I want to play meme stocks, whatever the biggest"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","784160","789320"," favorite, most favorite one is, right, so you put GME, and you can put AMC, and you can"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","789320","797080"," go and find these stocks on trackers for Wall Street Bets, Twitter, whatever, and let's say"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","797080","801080"," GME's trending right now, and they're telling you to buy, telling you to buy, you're not"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","801080","805680"," going to buy GME, you're going to come and you're going to start to chart it out, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","805680","810200"," you're going to decide when the price comes to you that you're going to buy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","810200","816640"," So the first thing that you're looking for is doing a trend line here, because you can"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","816640","821680"," see that it's going down, right, you know that this stock is going down, and we'll come"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","821680","828520"," in a little bit closer, and this doesn't even have to be actually perfect, especially on"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","828560","834120"," this huge chart here, but you know that that GME is trending down, and then you're going"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","834120","839400"," to want to put your support in, right, your horizontal lines, you know that there were"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","839400","851360"," buyers here, you know that there were buyers somewhere in here, and you know that there"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","851400","859000"," was major support down here, and everyone says hey GME's going up, but here it doesn't"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","859000","864760"," look like it is, and you can see this is a bullish trend right here, you see these three"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","864760","872600"," red candles come down, buyers step in, push it up, the bears want to check one more time"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","872600","878080"," in case it's going to go down, it gets rejected, and the bulls step back in and take it up."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","878080","882280"," Now we know we have sellers hiding up here, and they sold it down, they tried to get"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","882280","886200"," out from being trapped, you don't ever want to be buyers up in here, you ought to be buyers"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","886200","892080"," down here, so you set three more alerts, first major support, second major support, third"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","892080","897280"," major support, and you get those alerts when it comes down here so that you can buy."
"stzTtnDg7Dw","897280","901200"," If you were to be an owner of GME, you wanted to be an owner here, when this tagged, this"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","901200","906040"," would have been your alert, and you want to be an owner down here, so that if we come"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","906040","910240"," down for a next leg up, you can get out whenever you want to, and you're going to"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","910240","915480"," make as much money as you decide you want to make, and you already know sellers are"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","915480","920200"," hiding up here, so there's a fair chance of this coming down and testing deeper support"

"stzTtnDg7Dw","925760","933520"," to push this stock up to untrap themselves, and the last point I want to emphasize is"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","933520","939480"," by making these charts on multiple stocks, over time you're going to have 100, 200,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","939480","946480"," 300 stocks that you did a basic chart for, that you can come back, excuse me, you can"

"stzTtnDg7Dw","953840","958480"," been going, or you'll have some idea of what's been taking place, are your support lines"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","958480","963120"," or your resistance lines working, if not, do you have to adjust them, do you have to"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","963120","967160"," adjust how, where you find your support and resistance lines, it starts to self teach"

"stzTtnDg7Dw","978120","984080"," will, and I guarantee you if you do enough of these, eventually, if you've got 300 stocks"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","984080","989080"," that you're setting alerts on, they're going to start popping up inside of your email alert"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","989080","993680"," or your text messages once a day, three times a week, and you'll be ahead of the curve on"

"stzTtnDg7Dw","999040","1004040"," your meme stocks in here, and another place that you can, or other places you can find"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1004040","1010760"," stocks to start charting, and setting alerts on, would be Twitter, Wall Street Bets, one"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1010760","1016880"," of the trackers for Wall Street Bets, and I particularly, I try to find the sleepers,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1016880","1021400"," so I'll come to Finviz, they're scanner, and some people have complicated scanners that"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1021400","1027040"," they run on Finviz, I just do a basic one, I'm looking for stock, I'll go to all over"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1027040","1033840"," here, and it'll show me all the choices that I can make, and I'll just pick a 200 day simple"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1033840","1039160"," moving average, I will pick price below, I try to catch them before they actually rip,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1039160","1045480"," some people want to see that confirmation first, for me, I will chart these out, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1045480","1052000"," then if I start to hear chatter on Wall Street Bets, or Twitter, or YouTube, it triggers"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1052000","1057360"," in my mind when they are about to hit, I'll be like, oh, I just charted out this stock,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1057360","1061000"," and why is everybody just starting to talk about it now, and it still hasn't flipped,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1061000","1062000"," right?"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1062000","1068960"," I start to see positive news pieces coming out, I'll also change the price, so that"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1068960","1074640"," it's a high price descending, because I know these stocks are liquid mostly, I also"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1074640","1078480"," know that people like to play them, I also know that people like Netflix here, Samuel"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1078480","1084680"," Adams here, Zoom, Wayfair, Ring, you guys know all these stocks, I know some most of"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1084680","1090360"," you do, and these go for cyclicals as well, you can find good cyclicals in here, but let's"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1090360","1095920"," just take a look at Sam, this is actually a good one to look at, so I see that it's just"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1095920","1102320"," at its ER, and then it's dropped off massively, we all know that, so let's just add Sam onto"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1102320","1107340"," our charting, and this is actually a really good one, we're going to look at the Max"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1107340","1115680"," on Samuel Adams, you know this is an institution, this is, you question if Tesla is ever coming"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1115680","1125000"," down to 406 or 417, and all this took was poor guidance, or they didn't, the CEO did"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1125000","1133120"," not give a figure, it's called, it's not re-guidance, but he didn't come out and say"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1133120","1138680"," I'm going to change, we're going to change our guidance for this earnings release, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1138680","1143760"," that's almost, that's like legal fraud in a way, you know it's not illegal, but it's"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1143760","1149800"," incompetence by the CEO, and so it's something that simple, can drop your stock a lot, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1149800","1154880"," you can see they made it to 1349, people were buying Samuel Adams at 1349, I remember"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1154880","1161600"," people rode this up, and they probably got trapped, now it probably leaked, he sold"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1161600","1167120"," some stock, I guess it was scheduled, invested, that doesn't matter, he got out of a stock,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1167120","1173120"," and insiders knew that they didn't give new guidance before earnings release, so it's"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1173120","1179000"," sold down, but it sold down major on its ER day, and fucked investors, and fucked a lot"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1179000","1182680"," of people, it wasn't cool, but if you don't think a stock can drop like that, it can and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1182680","1187760"," this one did, so we're going to look at a slightly smaller timeframe, let's look at"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1187760","1194000"," that five here real quick, okay, and if I told you hey you want to buy Sam Adams at 9, let's"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1194000","1202120"," put a support there right, 904, if I had said you want to buy it at 904 you would have said"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1202120","1209040"," hell yeah I'll buy it right now, if I had then said to you do you want to buy it, down"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1209040","1215760"," here somewhere 763, you would have said there's no way it's ever going that low, if I had"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1215760","1223280"," said to you what about it, you know what if I had told you down here somewhere 664, he"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1223280","1235480"," would have said no way, but in reality Sam Adams traded you know at 374 in March of 2020,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1235480","1242200"," actually let's look back at 823, 2019 it traded at 445, that looks like it was high, it's high,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1242200","1249640"," same number was right over here in February, right, and then we started to get the truly"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1249640","1255760"," carbonated bad beverages that came out, and this was a new revenue stream for Samuel Adams,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1255760","1260740"," and it was pumped up on that new revenue stream, well now it's not working out for them, they"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1260740","1265160"," can't make inroads into bars and restaurants, it's like an epiphany, everyone knows now that"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1265160","1268480"," no one wants to drink truly when they go to the bar, they want to get a nice craft beer,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1268480","1273520"," they want to get a house made cocktail, that kind of stuff, so that revenue stream is not"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1273520","1278960"," what it was promised to be, so had we set some alerts for this stock, they would have"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1278960","1283320"," triggered, and so most of these stocks I'll trade one that's really low, I'll trade, you"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1283320","1294000"," know I'll place a GME that's way down here, you know 44 bucks could happen easily, at any"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1294000","1303240"," moment GME, or any other stock could have bad news, that'll dump it, so set these with"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1303240","1308160"," alerts, you can see here, you've got the 200A coming in, it's going to tap it, so I'm going"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1308160","1312840"," to set this last one, right on the 200A and I'm going to set an alert on Samuel Adams to"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1312840","1326560"," go long, create a new alert, price below, get a tags, and if it tags here, I'm going"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1326560","1332480"," to start to track Samuel Adams for a bounce, do I think it's ever coming back up here, maybe,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1332480","1336680"," I bet you that this is the top of the trading range, I bet you the bottom of the trading"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1336680","1346040"," range though, is now somewhere down here, I would bet, I bet it trades in here until"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1346040","1353280"," either the CEO is replaced, or new guidance is issued, new revenue stream, it could just"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1353280","1358920"," tap down here, and then eventually I bet, eventually even if it was just on a fishing"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1358920","1365920"," expedition for one day, that the banks will sell down fishing for a low price, and they"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1365920","1371880"," do this often, very briefly, so you could even just set a buy alert here at 572, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1371880","1376240"," if it fills, it fills, if it doesn't fill, it doesn't fill, but if you have 300 of these"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1376240","1380000"," stocks with these price alerts, I guarantee some of them are going to fill, and this is"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1380000","1385400"," the place you can find it, or you can start to set these on Finviz, you can come back,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1385400","1391840"," and you can set them for Netflix, we just had an ER that was bad for them as well, so"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1391840","1398240"," you set something nice and low on them, same with Zoom, Wayfair, Ring, that's 5 charts"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1398240","1404520"," for you to make alerts on, and this is the basics, this is how you trade basic, and if"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1404520","1410640"," you trade basic like this, I'm telling, especially if you start with a spy, you are going to"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1410640","1417920"," make money, you are going to over time, make more than you lose, and people try to complicate"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1417920","1423960"," these, so people over complicate trading, and it does not need to be over complicated,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1423960","1430600"," and that's when I post on Twitter, when, where, and how to buy, and they come out pretty good,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1430600","1436840"," I mean you talk, and I probably have a 70% win rate on Twitter, and just day trading"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1436840","1444880"," stuff, or like weekly's, I have a pretty good win rate there, it's not the best, it's not"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1444880","1451880"," the worst, but I know my big ones, when I see companies like Boeing, hit these support"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1451880","1459280"," lines, when spy hit the support line on the 19th, I called for a buy at that support, and"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1459280","1463080"," there are other factors that impact if you should be buying there, but you know with"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1463080","1470760"," a spread, it could still go down, you can see here, it dips even lower on October 30th,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1470760","1475040"," we got one last big down day, or I think it was like a down week or something, if I"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1475040","1481800"," recall, but when we had this last little dip, it still recovered, you know, so in a spread"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1481800","1486760"," is going to save you, if in case that happens, so let's just say on the 19th, we dipped down"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1486760","1492360"," to 418, or let's say we went down to 410, it's eventually going to come back, and print"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1492360","1498880"," what you wanted it to print, I hope this helps, I'm going to try to continue to release more"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1498880","1507200"," videos over time, like a daily brief, so that you can see the conditions of the market,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1507200","1511880"," and know if you should be bullish or bearish, and that's another thing is try not to get"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1511880","1519400"," trapped in being a bull or a bear, I mean it's a really hard thing to do, but at some"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1519400","1526760"," point you have to do it, and when it comes to Twitter and YouTube, you know, I just started"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1526760","1532440"," muting some of these guys, the ultra bulls, I muted them, the ultra bears, I muted them,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1532440","1539040"," and I tried to find actual traders, traders that traded a yes, traders that traded multiple"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1539040","1544160"," stocks, they didn't fall in love with one stock, if you can only trade Tesla, you're"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1544160","1548600"," not really a trader, you really aren't, you've got to be able to trade Tesla, Facebook,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1548600","1554080"," Apple, Boeing, cyclical stocks, it doesn't matter, you have to be able to make those"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1554120","1559960"," shifts and find out where the money is at, so don't get pigeonholed, don't fall in love"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1559960","1564000"," with a stock, fall in love with ES if you want to, fall in love with spy, because that's"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1564000","1569240"," going to be your bread and butter, no matter what, and try to stay out of those holes,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1569240","1575920"," you know, you might not do this, but I'll tell you what, it has worked for me a couple"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1575920","1581000"," times in the past where I overcomplicated my trading, and I just had to pull back, I had"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1581000","1586160"," to pull everything out, and I had to reset, I had, you know, if you're, if you want to"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1586160","1591160"," get, you know, running in the stock market or stay trading every day, just take a break,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1591160","1599040"," go hiking, go biking, go sailing, go do something else, and set an alert for, or watch spy every"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1599040","1602520"," day for when it's going to come back down to this buy area, and I'll tell you what,"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1602520","1606280"," if you dumped all of your money, or not all of it, but if you want to grow your account"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1606280","1611160"," which you can, but the key would be to buy at that point, when you're, when you're getting"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1611160","1616200"," back into the market is you just spend 30% of your money on some spreads, they're long"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1616200","1620160"," dated, one, three months out, and you see if they're going to hit, you know, and what"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1620160","1626080"," we are coming into a down season, September, October is known to be a down season, so you"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1626080","1630520"," could even turn bearish if you want, but the key here though is when you hit these, these"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1630520","1635840"," levels down here, they still print, they still print in October as well, so when you come"
"stzTtnDg7Dw","1635840","1645640"," back even a year before, 2019, 2018, seasonally, they still print it, okay, so I think that's"
