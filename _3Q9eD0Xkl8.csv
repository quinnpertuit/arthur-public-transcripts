"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","0","9000"," Good morning traders, Captain Jim James here with your daily brief. Hope you all did very well yesterday."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","9000","14000"," I hope some of you bears didn't buy puts until the close. I know a lot of you were itching to buy them early in the day."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","14000","23000"," So if you did buy puts in the close, we'll talk about those and how to play those as we move on this morning into the opening ballot 930."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","23000","35000"," I do want to briefly point out that I post the daily brief on Twitter each morning as a companion piece to the video, which talks about my game plan for the day today on the economic calendar."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","35000","47000"," We have non farm payrolls and the unemployment rate. Everyone's been waiting for these numbers all week long. It would be hilarious if they were a non event today and we just continued on our merry way sideways waiting for Monday."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","47000","56000"," I do expect some volatility this morning from now until 830 possibly even 930. The banks can spin these numbers any way that they want."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","56000","65000"," We have seen that time and again, if they say that if the numbers are high, the economy could be stronger. If the numbers are low, that could mean that they're not going to start tapering."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","65000","76000"," Now, if they don't taper, that means we're getting more QE, which means stocks go up, right? If the economy is getting stronger, they might just do a sympathy push to move this market up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","76000","84000"," What I would do is pay attention to the reaction on the tape this morning and not so much to what Finn to it is saying or how CNBC reacts."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","84000","94000"," I tend to put the blinders on when these numbers come out. I pay close attention to what's happening on a one minute time frame in whatever stock or ETF that I'm in."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","94000","103000"," Now, when these banks are positioning and when these numbers come out, sometimes the initial reaction will be for the stock to briefly go up or briefly go down."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","103000","114000"," And the knee-jerk reaction is, hey, it's going down. That means I should go short, but that's usually a fishing maneuver to get better positioning to move up or down."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","114000","119000"," So be conscious of that and you're trading this morning."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","119000","126000"," We're going to move on to the ES. And as I've been saying, this is not the time to be long in the ES."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","126000","135000"," It's not the prudent thing to do. As we are at the top of an established and respected trend line since September 2020."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","135000","142000"," Now, you will also note that in August or, yeah, in August 2020, we traded above and out of our normal trading range."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","142000","148000"," So this is of some concern to bears that we could make this jump today and trade higher."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","148000","158000"," Taking a closer look on the ES chart, you can see that earlier in the week, see this white line right here, this white resistance line was forming up over time."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","158000","168000"," And this line was forming up earlier in the week. This is kind of put us into this, into this zone here where yesterday we broke up and above yesterday and landed on top of this resistance."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","168000","181000"," Now, we've made three taps. And this is the fourth tap to get up above this resistance line. That is saying the market does want to go up, even though we are in a risk off environments in ES hands."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","181000","193000"," This was significant yesterday for us to make this jump above. And we're going to look at our day trading chart and see what we what kind of insights the ES lens to the cash market is."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","193000","199000"," As you can see here, I'm going to bring this chart slightly low, slightly bring it right here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","199000","208000"," You can see as the week has progressed, it's been quite quite simple to figure out where you should be short and where you should be long in this market."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","208000","213000"," A lot of the plays have been in the after hours. Same went for yesterday."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","214000","223000"," Into the opening into the closing bell, we hit all time highs again. I think this was all time highs, 44.1.85."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","223000","231000"," And I think some of you grab puts on this bell right here and not down here, which a lot of people were expecting to go short down here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","231000","237000"," This was the better position to take. And as we come into the open, say, let's talk about this briefly."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","238000","250000"," If you are a bull, you are most definitely looking for 441.92 to be bullish. And as a bear, you're looking for anything below this 440.80 to be bearish."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","250000","261000"," Now, still within this context this morning, if we are bullish, we could dip down to make this run up. And if we are bearish, we could bump up to come down."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","261000","269000"," This is an opportunity for banks to get short at a better price and for longs to get a better price to go up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","269000","286000"," So earlier in the week, I did made a post about thinking in twos and threes. You are looking for, you know, let's say we get bullish and we come down here, you're going to look for bears to want to take a tap to go down and they'll make one, two, and maybe three attempts."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","286000","294000"," In that third attempt, if it sticks and doesn't break, that is where you want to start to consider making entry as we go up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","294000","314000"," If you're a bear, that would be the same thing would be for you as well. Even no matter what the news is at 830 this morning, if we immediately come up here and don't gap up and we make one, two, and three taps and don't move up, you are going to look to start taking a short position as we head down this way here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","315000","325000"," Now, if you bought puts into clothes yesterday up in here, my recommendation on FDs is always to take the money and run."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","325000","334000"," So if you get a chance, let's say we come to this opening bell over here, you are going to be somewhere in profit 20, 30%."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","334000","345000"," Now, if we open the bell here, but dip down, you can take your profit as well. If the news is bearish, we might scream higher and you would hold through all the way down here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","345000","350000"," So there are different methods to how you play these FD puts that you get and how you sell them."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","350000","362000"," And the same goes for bulls. If you were a bull yesterday and grabbed this down here and held this into the clothes and are expecting this to go up, if we do a quick dip down here, you may want to hold tight until we come back up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","362000","367000"," It is not unusual for us to make violent moves at the open up and down here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","367000","377000"," So be prepared to sell your FDs either at this 441.88 or down below here, this 440.84."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","377000","382000"," You can always re-enter your calls or puts to ride the rest of the day out."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","382000","389000"," The point and the key in FDs is that they often don't go in the way that you want them to."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","389000","400000"," So I tend to, not always, but I do tend to sell my FDs right at the open. So buyer beware."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","400000","410000"," Moving on to NQ. Look at that sexy beautiful thing here, huh? I wanted to bring up the NQ mini so that you can see the drastic moves that we've made."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","410000","415000"," Now, I think this is on auto. So I haven't made any adjustments to this."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","415000","425000"," This big line right here, I dropped in here a few months ago, I think, to give some idea as to some major support if we ever come down from here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","425000","432000"," I'm just going to scroll this out a little bit for you and you can see that we messed around in this area on NQ."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","432000","439000"," And this would be, for me, some form of black swan event. This is how far we're coming down, the deepest."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","439000","454000"," One other neat thing about this chart is, even in March 2020, we didn't go as far down as this trend line that was established way back in the mid or mid to late 2000s, 2010 to 2018."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","454000","462000"," I thought that was neat as well. So we're going to take a look at a closer chart on NQ to put into a little bit more realistic scope here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","462000","474000"," 15135 is where I'm expecting where to find some sort of support this morning, and I am looking for us to trade higher to 15,200 and 15,273."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","474000","481000"," Now, it is always possible that we could hit this upper resistance somewhere around 15,306."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","481000","490000"," If we have bad news this morning, when we break through this 15,135, we talked earlier in the week, we don't want to be breaking 15,008."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","490000","497000"," If we do, this is kind of like a point of no return down here. You're going to start pulling targets down here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","497000","507000"," I think it's 14,600 is the next major one. So this is kind of like a sell the market kind of a deal down here, though I don't see that happening today or Monday."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","507000","524000"," On to the IWM, I just want to point out on a larger timeframe, Derek Cortenoy yesterday pointed this support line out, and we do use these lines in our research for when to start considering making entries into the rut into IWM, the small caps."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","524000","532000"," The tops aren't as consistent to play in these, so I do play these on a smaller chart over the course of a month or a daily or weekly."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","532000","538000"," We'll get into that chart right now, but this is a neat little chart right here that he pointed out yesterday."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","538000","554000"," Moving on to a smaller timeframe, as you know from the past in the daily briefs in these videos, when we adjust these lines as we adjust these support and resistance lines as time moves forward, but again we play all these all these jumps here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","554000","565000"," And the most recent one was yesterday in the daily brief, I talked about how I was tracking this IWM here and some equity volume and call option volume and come in."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","565000","573000"," And so we played this yesterday, and we did very well in this play, and we've been talking about how bullish we are up to around 226."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","573000","578000"," I believe it's 226.65 or something for the rest of the week."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","578000","591000"," Today as long as the news is good I'm looking for 290 or 292, some form of a bounce, and I move up to test 22528 and possibly 228.926."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","591000","606000"," Now, if the book bearish case you're looking for a break below this 299, and maybe further confirmation down to this 21676, and then for a move down below to 21118."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","606000","611000"," This is really where we're at in the market right now is a big move up or a big move down."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","611000","615000"," Moving on to Tesla, everything looks beautiful, same chart as we've had up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","615000","620000"," There is a little bit of a development here in Tesla that I want to get into on a smaller timeframe."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","620000","628000"," Yesterday I posted, I think right around this area here, I felt as though we were bearish into the clothes on a small timeframe."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","628000","635000"," Now, the thing that you want to be looking at is that we have touched this 720 right in here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","635000","640000"," We've touched right around here a few times this week, four times this week already."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","640000","646000"," Touch it once, twice, three times, four times, five times, and we did again yesterday."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","646000","654000"," This is telling me that this structure here that does somewhat look bearish overall is not."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","654000","658000"," And I'm pointing that out yesterday that I was bearish on a smaller timeframe."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","658000","663000"," I do think that today all signs are pointing towards the IWM coming up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","663000","668000"," I think that those numbers are going to say that the economy is slightly improving."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","668000","674000"," I think you're going to find that you'll a mixed bag of numbers and that the message is going to be that the economy is improving."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","674000","683000"," And then what came out yesterday with Elon Musk not being invited to the White House because of the unions, I think is just fun."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","683000","694000"," I think that oftentimes you have to trade the ticker and specifically Tesla and not what the news is telling you that it's inaccurate does not want you to know what's actually taking place."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","694000","702000"," So for today on Tesla, if there is any dip here in Tesla, I will be buying that dip for a run up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","702000","706000"," If there is a straight gap up today, I'm looking for 730."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","706000","709000"," Let's see if I can get this chart to move a little bit here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","710000","712000"," The hold on here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","712000","714000"," Get there right there for you."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","714000","718000"," Today I'm looking for 727."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","718000","724000"," Let's say call it 72971 and possibly even a push up to 73878."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","724000","726000"," I think today is a big day for Tesla."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","726000","728000"," I think they might print some calls today."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","728000","736000"," And if they don't do it today and it just bleeds off down here, I will exit my position somewhere below."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","736000","738000"," Let's call it 709."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","738000","744000"," Unless it's a straight rip down and comes back up, I'll exit my position and I'll reenter once more a close."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","744000","748000"," And I'm expecting that to somewhere bounce somewhere into clothes down here at 700."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","748000","753000"," Either today or tomorrow expect a big move up for Tesla."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","753000","757000"," Last chart to look at this morning is Robinhood being an IPO."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","757000","762000"," There is no established trading history, no channels, nothing that you can really look at."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","762000","765000"," You're very limited on the information that you have."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","765000","774000"," You do know at some point, as it falls, it will eventually exhaust sellers and the demand and buyers will step in."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","774000","776000"," You do know that."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","776000","780000"," You know there's demand down here at 37.96."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","780000","785000"," You knew there was some demand down here between 4358 and 4601."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","785000","791000"," There was also a demand down here at 50.3, let's say."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","791000","797000"," Between 50.3 and 5455."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","797000","806000"," Now yesterday we had that large sharp fishing expedition down here to see if we could fall farther, which we didn't."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","806000","812000"," That is important for this support line to hold."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","812000","818000"," So the thing that you're looking for today is can you break over this wall of sellers up here?"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","818000","821000"," You cannot, it'll be a continued move downwards."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","821000","828000"," Now these guys down here and these guys down here, they don't want to see this 50.53 break today."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","828000","836000"," If there is a break in this today, you can expect more selling somewhere down into this 4601 and 4358."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","836000","840000"," I expect that to continue all the way down to 37.96."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","840000","845000"," If you do break over this resistance line today,"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","845000","849000"," the next step for you would be to wait for this support to hold."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","849000","853000"," You want to wait for all these sellers, last one to get out,"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","853000","858000"," and then you could take this stock long once more and continue up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","858000","864000"," When you do take this stock up either from this support, these supports or this support,"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","864000","870000"," the one thing you have to consider is that there are still some more sellers hiding out up here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","870000","874000"," And the first place you'll see that is at 60.56."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","874000","877000"," These are people that are diamond handing or saying,"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","877000","881000"," I'll wait for it to come back up to the number that I want to just get out."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","881000","886000"," So you've got some of those people as well to worry about each step along the way."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","886000","890000"," Now if you're completely bullish on Robinhood, you think it's going to moon, moon, moon."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","890000","895000"," You are definitely looking here for sellers and you're definitely looking here for sellers without a doubt."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","895000","901000"," Anything above this mark right here, you should expect some sideways movement to gain some momentum"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","901000","903000"," and then make one more move up."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","903000","907000"," So my call for today would be, it's just hurry up and wait."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","907000","909000"," You're waiting for people to stop selling in here."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","909000","915000"," You're waiting for some form of support to be met and then you're waiting for that next move up"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","915000","919000"," and you're going to definitely find sellers at 60.34."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","919000","923000"," Myself, if you have some charting software outside of Robinhood,"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","923000","931000"," I'll set some alerts down here at 4590 or 4601, 4358 and 37"
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","931000","936000"," and just monitor it as time moves forward before taking a long position."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","936000","940000"," As far as you know and I know, this is still coming down."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","940000","944000"," My price target until we turn but bullish is 37.96."
"_3Q9eD0Xkl8","944000","950000"," For any of you still watching this video, I do appreciate all the support the channel has received."
