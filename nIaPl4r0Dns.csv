"580190","581870"," So you're left here on devices."
"583410","588570"," Coming into this week specifically, I don't know why, but as we came into this week specifically,"
"589850","594630"," stuff started to hit us that I have no choice but to help out along the way. "
"595190","603350"," And as a matter of fact, even into today, I was going to not stream today due to things we"
"603350","604150"," have going on."
"605190","608770"," Specific specifically tax stuff and my children's schooling."
"610090","613450"," So my my two daughters are homeschooled. "
"613450","615950"," They do a blend of homeschooling."
"616050","617250"," There were secular homeschoolers."

"654950","659730"," One, we do travel a lot and our children, of course, come with us."
"660610","663950"," And we have a bunch of other reasons why we homeschool, but regardless, we can talk about that"
"663950","669990"," another time regardless with this being finalization of taxes and stuff like that."
"670510","677210"," And Matt brushes and dashes and my children being home, like so my kids go to an online school"

"718470","724010"," religious homeschoolers out there or we're just normal people."
"726410","731750"," And we, we, we were during COVID, there was no in-person testing."
"732710","738910"," Just this time right here, we have in-person testing because they don't trust kids, they have the"
"738910","742390"," software for kids so that they, their eyes aren't shifting and all that kind of stuff. "
"742810","744130"," So they want you to show up in person."
"745510","747510"," We thought it would be broken up and it wasn't."
"747630","749610"," It was like one test after another. "

"873170","874830"," spent the entire day with me."

"1026470","1028010"," We had CPI this morning."
"1028130","1029710"," We know we saw the reaction on CPI."
"1030609","1032950"," We all know we all know what that was like. "
"1033470","1037910"," I did post make a post on Finn to it."
"1037950","1039430"," I wanted to post this yesterday before."
"1039430","1042030"," But I was like, oh, I'll save it for CPI. "
"1043470","1047670"," And I'd assume that I'd be able to read this article."
"1048250","1054290"," I think now it's a day or two old, but I think I thought it was succulent for CPI specifically."
"1055830","1060710"," And you could see that squeeze higher this morning on the on the CPI news. "
"1062350","1064670"," And how short this market actually is."
"1064730","1067810"," We saw that even heading into the past couple of weeks."
"1068220","1072110"," How much of a head is placed on the S&P 500 right now?"
"1072510","1078790"," And the fascinating part of that article that I posted was that this is for pure profit and"
"1078790","1079110"," speculation. "
"1080090","1081090"," I'm going to bring this up."
"1081210","1082810"," This article up for you here in just a moment."

"1096590","1102330"," We're trading up into the minutes sounding like a fed pause."
"1103790","1108330"," That's there'll be some discussion of that and that we're trading. "
"1108630","1111390"," We're trading or we're, you know, you like, sell the news."
"1112550","1119170"," People wonder why we sell the news because they're pricing in a pause, not a rate cut, but a pause"
"1119170","1123290"," or even some kind of like managed pause over time."
"1123290","1125510"," Even the threat of that, we should trade up. "
"1126150","1130670"," And I'll show you later today, this morning, before the minute to release."
"1132510","1139350"," I'm going to explain my position on this because I fucking want, oh, shit, I swore."
"1140970","1143330"," I'm going to beat myself here. "
"1143430","1143790"," I'm off, swimming."
"1145750","1147110"," I can't believe I just swore."
"1147970","1151590"," OK, so this is going to be a hard one today. "
"1151710","1152570"," It's not going to be an easy one."
"1152570","1155450"," I'll lead to the EIA crude oil inventories."
"1156790","1164810"," My positive here is I'm watching people pontificate out there about where the market should be on a"
"1164810","1166610"," fed rate hike or not. "
"1166770","1170550"," Like a fed cut and then a pause and how it impacts the market."
"1170990","1174630"," And the truth is this, the truth is you need certain things."
"1175070","1180830"," You need like all these things to line up for the rate cut to get the market, to capitulate one"
"1180830","1181310"," last time. "
"1181790","1182730"," That's a key point."
"1183370","1184910"," The second key point here."
"1186090","1191370"," The second key point here is that when we get a rate pause or even talk of a rate pause"
"1191370","1198130"," or thought of a rate pause or any of that kind of stuff, the markets, the market for that time"
"1198130","1200050"," period should trade sideways and. "
"1201810","1204610"," Now, everyone likes to gloss over this fact."
"1204830","1208590"," What they like to do is get you a chart out there that's a 20 year chart and they show"
"1208590","1211050"," you that it goes up and then it capitulates and crashes down."
"1211050","1217150"," They don't show you the five months, six months, or even further back in time, the year that we"
"1217150","1217770"," traded sideways. "
"1218510","1219590"," That's a draw on the forecast."
"1220170","1225150"," I build on the forecast of minus one spot, zero five million gasoline in inventories minus zero"
"1225150","1228250"," spot, three, three million minus zero spot, three, three million."
"1228610","1233590"," A build on the forecast of minus one spot, nine million is still at inventories, minus zero spot,"
"1233850","1241650"," zero minus zero spot, six, zero, six million minus zero spot, plus minus zero spot, two million,"
"1241970","1243770"," still waiting for the cushing inventories. "
"1245870","1252190"," The other issue here, crude cushing inventories minus zero spot, four, zero, nine million minus"
"1252190","1253910"," zero spot, four, zero, nine million."
"1255190","1259970"," The other issue here is that we're if we're having discussions on a fed pause or pausing or even"
"1259970","1263030"," any kind of like all managers pause, right?"
"1263890","1269610"," You're you're still likely going to see the fed increase rates over time."
"1270630","1273030"," Let's say they let's say they have talk about a pause. "
"1273150","1274550"," We're going to trade sideways and up."
"1275250","1281670"," If we get a pause, we're going to trade sideways and up inventories of crude and US strategic"
"1281670","1287610"," petroleum reserve off one spot, six million barrels to 369 spot, five, eight million."
"1288290","1293610"," If we get a cut, we will capitulate, but nothing's lined up per cut right now. "
"1293930","1298770"," The truth is, the truth is you're likely going to get more increases down the road."
"1298770","1303510"," A pause think think pause and rate increases over time."
"1304350","1307310"," So again, we're jumping the gun on rate cuts. "
"1308450","1315650"," Another thing here, too, is Andy Constance had some great alpha out there."
"1315730","1319250"," He's been posting on to Finchway recently."
"1319850","1322190"," And it's crazy because I'm reading this out. "
"1322350","1322910"," That's great alpha."
"1323350","1325530"," I'll bring that up to you this morning for you."
"1325530","1330610"," And if you read it closely, if you read it closely, everyone's like, it's bearish. "
"1331130","1332170"," I'm like, yeah, not, not really."
"1332710","1338170"," If you read it closely, he talks about liquidity drying up in the first week of May."
"1339330","1346870"," This kind of tracks with us having a great April and trading up into the beginning of May. "
"1348650","1351750"," It does track with us having a pullback in May."
"1353570","1358430"," So it's not really as bearish as you might think that the other point that it is, the other point"
"1358430","1364990"," with to his posts have kind of not has them as bearish as you think it is."
"1365650","1373190"," It's kind of in line with what to expect outside of unknown news, what to expect into the beginning"
"1373190","1373610"," of May. "
"1374570","1376930"," So not as bearish as as people are thinking."
"1377030","1383590"," As a matter of fact, the the seeking alpha article stays higher."
"1383850","1384750"," I'll bring that up right now. "
"1386550","1387510"," I'll bring them in a minute."
"1387950","1388710"," It doesn't matter."
"1388850","1389790"," I should have read it on your own. "
"1389870","1390610"," I've already posted it."
"1390770","1391630"," Oil inventories."
"1392050","1395630"," And Ted Sparkin says the CPI report today was pretty much as expected. "
"1396670","1402270"," If you read that one, if you read that article to the end, you'd even speak about read at the"
"1402270","1402490"," end."
"1402490","1405710"," I'm going to focus on core inflation and still more to do that."
"1406970","1410790"," This liquidity not leaving the market until beginning of May. "
"1411230","1412470"," And so this kind of sounds right."
"1412470","1418530"," It does sound logical after having a bad March and April two years ago or a year ago."
"1418530","1419990"," We would have a decent one. "
"1420190","1422170"," And I definitely see demand pooling."
"1422950","1424630"," We would have a decent one."
"1425350","1428330"," Ted Sparkin speaking in an interview on CNBC. "
"1431150","1434170"," We would have a decent March or excuse me, March and April."
"1434290","1438890"," This year watching that and lags as I contemplate my main meeting."
"1445020","1447180"," Let me make sure I got the daily trigger right here. "
"1448840","1449360"," 40265."
"1451900","1453420"," There's a daily trigger here."
"1453980","1455360"," Way down here. "
"1456920","1457440"," 40265."
"1458140","1461560"," Sparkin says there is still more to do to get core inflation down."
"1462880","1464840"," Pools haven't been given any relief, right?"
"1465580","1467680"," We're just, we're not even down at this daily trigger. "
"1467860","1470600"," Look at how high this monthly, this hourly trigger is."
"1470600","1475800"," It's literally been by the early trigger, by the early trigger, by the early trigger, by the early"
"1475800","1476160"," trigger."
"1476320","1478860"," There hasn't been any chance for pools to buy. "
"1479120","1482360"," It's something that costs peak inflation, but there's still a ways to go."
"1483260","1485200"," To buy anything but the early trigger."
"1485660","1487300"," No chance to buy the daily trigger. "
"1487300","1488340"," Look at how low it is."
"1488600","1491820"," We haven't seen this in some time at all."
"1491940","1495500"," We've just been melting up, melting up, melting up. "
"1496080","1497220"," So May, right?"
"1497420","1498980"," May sounds right this year."
"1499660","1506660"," When you have one bad year, one bad April and one bad March, you're, you're statistically, you have"
"1506660","1509420"," an even better chance of having a pretty good March and April."
"1511160","1513340"," With all that said, we know about the debt ceiling. "
"1513640","1516320"," We know about the invasion for Taiwan, right?"
"1516960","1517460"," We know about."
"1517740","1523140"," That's Sparkin says in my view is as we react to inflation as it comes in in terms of the"
"1523140","1523600"," right path."
"1524140","1528540"," Just to repeat this, that's Sparkin says my view is we react to inflation as it comes in in terms"
"1528540","1528960"," of the right path. "
"1528960","1533680"," And I'm looking very hard at demand and labor market and inflation."
"1535400","1537920"," We know about sell and may go away."
"1538140","1540480"," We know in summer times we usually have a dip, right?"
"1540900","1542220"," We know those things already there. "
"1542320","1546840"," We know that our chances this year, the probability and likelihood of having a more stabilized"
"1546840","1547420"," market."
"1547520","1553300"," We know that this year specifically, and even since October, have been a return to a normalization"
"1553300","1558840"," of market so far."
"1558840","1560960"," That so far, that's all it's shown us. "
"1561080","1562460"," We haven't been shown anything else."
"1563360","1567940"," Anything else except for a return to a normalization of market functions."
"1568680","1570240"," So this all looks normal. "
"1570880","1573100"," Do we get a dip into the 18th, 19th, 20th, April?"
"1573280","1573820"," I think we do."
"1574220","1575320"," I think we do get that."
"1575560","1576940"," It pays April 12th, right?"
"1577500","1581080"," I think leading into the 19th, 18th, 19th, 20th, we get a pullback. "
"1581580","1583980"," This is the return to normalization of markets."
"1585560","1591840"," That otherwise, outside of something unknown, things have been pits barking says he pretty much"
"1591840","1593420"," shines that demand is cooling."
"1594620","1600200"," Things have been pretty much expected to an extent expected. "
"1601020","1602620"," So we're going to we'll take a look tomorrow."
"1602760","1604700"," I want to show you guys the any constant stuff."
"1604700","1613220"," I want to show you guys the fed funds rate, the yield curve in version. "
"1613220","1615880"," I'll show you the unemployment rate inflation."
"1617220","1623080"," The S&P 500 rate pause, what normally happens in a rate pause, even the discussion of a rate pause."
"1623960","1625080"," It's impact on the market. "
"1625240","1625980"," How long that can last?"
"1626220","1629060"," That can last three months, six months, nine months, years."
"1630080","1634280"," If it's something where we go back from a pause to another 25 BPM."
"1634440","1638820"," As far as says, if you want to get inflation back to the go, you need multiple months where it's"
"1638820","1639320"," headed there. "
"1642040","1648880"," So, we already talked about, we already talked about when we do get the capitulation phase."
"1649120","1651240"," We've talked about it ad nauseam, right?"
"1651560","1652680"," You have to be above the rate of inflation."
"1653260","1653800"," We're not there yet. "
"1653880","1654640"," Our way is high."
"1657180","1661740"," That's bulk and says trend lines do matter, but we need to get back to inflation go."
"1663800","1665000"," Let's take a look at the. "
"1665000","1671910"," I'm telling me this book map real quick."
"1676110","1679890"," It's parking says we don't want to declare victory prematurely on inflation."
"1681270","1682490"," And just look at this here. "
"1683890","1684550"," Narlie, huh?"
"1684770","1685690"," This is a one minute chart."
"1686170","1687890"," It looks like a 30 minute chart really quick."
"1698620","1703740"," We can see right down here that the daily is slightly overbought, but it's been overbought for some"
"1703740","1704520"," time now, right?"
"1704520","1707460"," Then overbought overbought overbought overbought. "
"1707700","1709400"," Just keep cranking away right now."
"1709840","1710820"," Our lease still looks good."
"1714870","1719710"," And you just been buying the hourly buying the early dips below the early just buying it, buying"
"1719710","1720550"," it, buying it. "
"1720930","1722370"," Where does a bull want to buy it?"
"1722490","1724070"," Well, the bull's bought it back down here."
"1724230","1727990"," I'm not hearing there is much change in bank lending at the moment."
"1728670","1731190"," And they want to buy 40266, right?"
"1731690","1733270"," I talked to you about the VIX as well. "
"1733270","1735330"," Well, we won't do VX."
"1735510","1736270"," We'll do VIX."
"1742720","1747180"," And remember when I talked to you last week about the VIX and I was like, well, it'll be horrible"
"1747180","1749260"," as if we just do this, right?"
"1750020","1750960"," This is the melt up. "
"1751040","1752920"," This is what a melt up looks like on the VIX."
"1752980","1756620"," Historically, if you go back in history and this whole thing right here."
"1757500","1761740"," This whole thing right here is exactly what a melt up in the market looks like. "
"1763180","1764120"," Just like that."
"1764960","1766000"," And you'll see this."
"1766240","1766880"," You'll see it. "
"1767020","1768860"," This is actually just showing us the melt up, right?"
"1769340","1770220"," You'll see right here."
"1770640","1773300"," We just got to buy it down below in the VIX."
"1773740","1775360"," This is at 810. "
"1775620","1777600"," And now it's cranking higher right now."
"1777720","1778780"," Let's get that on the one minute chart."
"1783280","1785900"," And it just zigs and zags and zigs and zags. "
"1786140","1790500"," And if you look closely here, this looks like you can see here."
"1790600","1792540"," It just gets sold right back down, right?"
"1793260","1793960"," Right off that daily."
"1793960","1796860"," And until that daily gets above 20 bucks, 20, 20. "
"1797020","1803360"," Right now it's $20.20. It's going to continue to be sold down, sold down, sold down."
"1803860","1805280"," So this is intraday kind of stuff."
"1807440","1809160"," What are we looking for here, right?"
"1809700","1813560"," We're looking for that we have the sellers here above that 1941. "
"1815200","1818280"," And we know we're going to look for support in the market."
"1819260","1822780"," Whenever we trade up here and whenever we trade up here as well."
"1822780","1830560"," So keep this on your charts at home, $20.28. And then right where we are right now, $19.06"
"1830560","1831660"," on the VIX. "
"1848190","1849910"," Nice little bear cross right here."
"1850030","1851890"," A little bit of a bear airplane right above us."
"1852430","1853770"," We'll take a look at the five minute here. "
"1854950","1855830"," Five minute chart."
"1860220","1863060"," I'm going to not delete, but get rid of this one real quick here."
"1865960","1867380"," Just so we can see it closely. "
"1872490","1875190"," Bear flag forming above right now in the five minute."
"1876650","1877910"," Go back to the one minute."
"1878470","1880810"," Beautiful bear flag right here or barrel plane. "
"1880870","1882510"," We call it not a bear flag, but a barrel plane."
"1883290","1886430"," If you want to get bearish here, you're looking to sell 41080."
"1890870","1892010"," I'll put the other. "
"1892450","1893230"," This is the six."
"1893430","1894690"," This is the six."
"1895070","1895890"," We see here stuff. "
"1897050","1898370"," Six CMA right here."
"1898470","1901990"," I am seeing demand cooling for time waiting for inflation to crack."
"1901990","1904050"," We're not seeing evidence of that yet. "
"1906290","1912710"," And bedsparken says I need to see inflation down at the target rate over the successive months."

"2470660","2474960"," If if we so into these minutes today we start to break below."

"3238630","3239910"," from is it from 345. "
"3241150","3243210"," We have my or we have we've got."

"3255390","3257710"," I'm like, you know, 345 and four."
"3258790","3260550"," We're at 345, right?"
"3260690","3261290"," We got a 3200. "
"3261710","3262850"," That's a 200 point move."
"3263610","3266050"," From from our low in 2022."
"3266050","3268170"," So are we changing the targets. "
"3269250","3270310"," How we change it?"
"3270430","3275610"," Does that just the retest of the previous low 200 points we can put on the board in two weeks."
"3276370","3279190"," So I'm like, yeah, if we hit 345 and then we had 3200."
"3280230","3286410"," We're no longer discussing 2800 or 1600 or whatever nonsense 2400. "
"3286810","3288870"," It's not that far off is it?"
"3289270","3294070"," It looks more like a confirmation trade to go higher in the market."
"3294070","3300310"," So just just in that perspective, percentages and prices as to this crash that we're going to have."
"3300870","3303350"," You probably should have bought 345, right?"
"3303750","3306350"," You probably should go back and buy 3200, right?"
"3306550","3307690"," The demand should be there. "
"3308350","3313590"," We talk about how years from now, when you look back on these moments, you're going to say, man, I"
"3313590","3315070"," should have bought that 3450."
"3315450","3316890"," I should have bought that 3200."
"3317990","3323850"," I traded this market up and not listen because you have to remember this five years from now. "
"3324450","3329630"," You're going to look back and say, you know, we were talking about 2800."
"3329730","3330270"," We're talking about 60."
"3330430","3331750"," We never even got close to that. "
"3332150","3335850"," We got down to 3432 targets like that."
"3336130","3341830"," Our last stipulation in the trough phase didn't bring us down to 14 or 1600 in the market."
"3341830","3343970"," It brings up another question. "
"3344290","3345730"," This is one that Winky brought up to me."
"3346070","3353830"," We're talking together and he was like, are people expecting the market to crash to 1400 or 2000"
"3353830","3356010"," every two or three years?"
"3356370","3360370"," What impact does that have on people in the market?"
"3360490","3366230"," His other question too that he made a fair point about was his other question too was, what about"
"3366230","3371650"," being a desk that's always short side right now that's always sawing this market?"
"3372690","3377730"," Typically, it ends up blowing up hedge funds at some point down the road."
"3378490","3384130"," Usually over the over time, probability favors a bull. "
"3384750","3389670"," If you look at this market since it's inception, it's inception, right?"
"3391230","3399010"," Every one to three years, we go on a bull run and this is where sell side gets run over."
"3399710","3407570"," So I'm sitting on a desk and I've had to be short the S&P 500 specifically, the S&P"
"3407570","3408190"," 500."
"3409070","3414930"," Not individual ticker, the S&P 500 and you're just short all the time. "
"3414930","3417730"," You're just like, we're net short."
"3418530","3423530"," The longer you do that, the higher risk comes into play of blowing up your hedge fund."
"3425030","3426490"," I mean, get run over. "
"3429360","3431660"," So time favors a bull."
"3432480","3433780"," The Fed knows this."
"3433960","3440040"," When you hear that soft landing or no landing argument from the Fed, it's time. "
"3440340","3441240"," That's what they're talking about."
"3441520","3441760"," Time."
"3441760","3449600"," The more time that we spend down here, the more time that we're down here, you will see a few"
"3449600","3450320"," things happen. "
"3450820","3452840"," Inflation continues to move up."
"3453420","3458280"," The valuation and growth in our economy, even if it slows, goes up."
"3459540","3461620"," Goes up, goes up, goes up. "
"3462160","3463460"," It always goes up."
"3463740","3465020"," Well, it fluctuates."
"3465380","3468340"," It's a curve, but it always goes up. "
"3468340","3476020"," And so longer you see us down here, the more of a chance of this explosive move higher at some"
"3476020","3476320"," point."
"3480480","3481300"," Hey, what's up, monkey?"
"3481440","3481900"," How are you doing, man?"
"3483120","3486240"," I just saw your, I just saw your, you're in the stream, man."

"3570630","3581090"," Normally the hedge comes off between 11.30 and 1.30. See"
"3581090","3586750"," if you can find that article from Seeking Out Alpha, which I'm not a fan of Seeking Out Alpha,"

"3919180","3920100"," Check one, two."
"3920380","3923440"," Let me take my check one, two."
"3924040","3925600"," I can turn my side up brother a little bit. "
"3926280","3928140"," If that helps, does that help you at all?"
"3933110","3934030"," Can you hear me now better?"
"3934630","3934890"," Is that louder?"
"3936450","3938310"," I think that's louder, but I'm not positive."
"3952030","3953470"," Don't buy this dip right here."
"3954430","3954570"," All right. "
"3954710","3956090"," I can't say don't buy this dip right here."
"3956550","3957970"," I wouldn't be buying this dip right here."

"3983500","3984740"," I'll turn squawk up for you brother. "
"3993790","3995890"," They set their levels different every day."
"3997190","3999730"," And so sometimes I have to adjust to my end."
"4004190","4005450"," It's likely a trap right here. "
"4005530","4007390"," I'll show you guys in the back end what I'm looking at here."
"4013380","4014560"," This is the VIX right here."
"4021050","4022630"," You can see this one minute right here. "
"4022730","4023190"," This is the one minute."
"4023430","4024050"," This is the five minute."
"4024450","4025150"," This is the hourly. "
"4026250","4028110"," There's a three trigger cluster right here."
"4029050","4033750"," I'm going to look for a push up on spy right now, but then this is the hold to move"
"4033750","4034190"," higher here."
"4048250","4052430"," So I'll throw a squeeze here and then a swift reversal hold down if possible. "
"4053710","4057390"," I'm going to assume that there's a hedge on the market right now."
"4059150","4061210"," Bear across on the five minute above here."
"4061210","4063010"," I want you to be aware of this right here above us. "
"4063770","4065290"," So this could be a bull trap."
"4066690","4068230"," We'll just see this right here."
"4069930","4071210"," Don't ever like seeing these. "
"4073690","4078390"," Don't like seeing them form on a five minute chart say the least."
"4079710","4081510"," If we hold on here."
"4084350","4085270"," Do you sing in?"
"4086650","4087470"," Sing for daddy. "
"4088930","4089650"," I like when you sing."
"4091470","4093270"," Don't ever watch the girl by the way either."
"4095290","4099670"," Here in your you sing in your youth is makes daddy very happy. "
"4101490","4104670"," Even if we trade up here could be a trap down lower here."
"4106970","4108970"," Could also be a trap down lower here."

"4248250","4251650"," dip eyes down below on Tesla like Tesla's holding up in the red box up here. "
"4252090","4258710"," Even with that said, I would not be long Tesla unless price and not only price."
"4259010","4261130"," Well, they sold this right down right here too."
"4261270","4263030"," On Tesla just boom. "
"4263250","4266690"," Sell it right down on you for rates to stay high up along the."
"4267950","4269250"," Like get down there."
"4269390","4269950"," Get down there. "
"4269950","4270690"," Why is that?"
"4270810","4271950"," Why do we have sell side?"
"4272210","4274290"," So finding this to be so risky down below."
"4274790","4276850"," It's because you're on the daily trend, right?"
"4277090","4278430"," The one the five minute."
"4278850","4281090"," The one the five minute the hourly in the daily. "
"4281250","4285030"," This right here is very, very volatile right here."
"4285250","4289550"," Price stays above the hourly the five minute and the one minute."
"4290110","4292030"," You're going to see seller step in. "
"4292370","4295090"," Why why so aggressive though would be the question."
"4295370","4298530"," That's because that's where all of the sell side is."
"4299650","4302290"," We know as we come up into this zone. "
"4302430","4303810"," This is a 30 minute chart now in Tesla."
"4304370","4309250"," We already know for a fact that the higher we trade up here."
"4309390","4311490"," There's your 220 by the way, right?"
"4312050","4315350"," The moment we start begin to consolidate and trade up in here. "
"4315850","4318390"," That becomes that becomes very aggressive, right?"
"4318990","4320890"," You already know how aggressive it becomes."
"4321430","4325210"," You know that these you know that sell side is above here, right?"
"4325490","4326110"," They sold here."
"4326210","4327030"," They sold here. "
"4327030","4329770"," They sold right here, right?"
"4329890","4331250"," We know where the sellers are."
"4331730","4337410"," We know we trade up here and break above sellers and we begin to squeeze and you see 223."
"4338310","4341890"," And not only that, any more consolidation down here. "
"4342310","4343850"," We start to run over."
"4344310","4348890"," As Macklin says, the implied expectation in the market is that we're going to be cutting our policy"
"4348890","4350010"," rate later in the year."
"4350370","4353770"," That doesn't look today like the most likely scenario to us. "
"4353770","4357190"," Sell side and take out that 300 above, right?"
"4357750","4362470"," So you're going to see sell side be aggressive where we are right now."
"4362890","4384230"," So if you want to get long on Tesla here in safety, you want"
"4384230","4391680"," price to be above the one minute at 180, 180, 340 price to be above."
"4392260","4394420"," Take along with a with a stop underneath. "
"4395080","4397980"," You know that there's also so right down in here."
"4402370","4403770"," If you want to take."
"4409590","4410510"," You would need prep. "
"4410710","4414570"," Well, we could have a check, but you want price to be above 180, 346."
"4415790","4419050"," And your target above is 185, 76."
"4424570","4426210"," Let's call it 185, 50. "
"4489540","4491460"," And here's a key point right here."
"4491560","4494960"," When you're trading this up, right, with all of this volatility in here, right?"
"4495500","4498220"," You're always looking for the confirmation, right?"
"4498920","4500740"," Take that next trade there."
"4501460","4504140"," And the same thing, the same thing goes for here. "
"4504280","4506940"," If you take this trade higher, this here."
"4509960","4512000"," If you take this trade higher, right?"
"4513540","4517780"," You need the confirmation to put your next one on, right?"
"4518380","4522400"," You wait for the confirmation, the trade higher, right?"
"4522400","4532070"," And the same thing goes for trading above the"
"4532070","4533490"," daily trigger here."
"4533710","4536770"," So let's say we squeeze, let's say we do, let's just say we do this, right?"
"4537330","4540210"," You take a second leg of the trade, right?"
"4540310","4541330"," You break above here. "
"4541990","4544010"," You're not in the trade any longer here."
"4544210","4548830"," You're reentering the trade if it bounces on the daily trigger here, right?"
"4549770","4552710"," With no bounce here, there was no trade for you."
"4552930","4554050"," You wanted to see price. "
"4554050","4558450"," Confirm that the move is higher, right?"
"4558570","4559070"," Does that make sense?"
"4561570","4573110"," Same thing goes for this 193.21. Then your next stop above there, 221 "
"4573110","4582910",".78. 221.50. Now for macro market conditions right now, what I just told you"
"4582910","4587050"," about the S&P 500, this looks like a bull trap on S&P 500."
"4587050","4589950"," Would I take this trade today on Fed Minute Day?"
"4590430","4592510"," I think it's none of your..."
"4592510","4598370"," I don't think it's the best trade to take on Fed Day or Fed Minute Day."
"4599250","4601230"," It's not the best trade to take. "
"4601410","4608290"," The one thing on your side, the one good thing on your side for this trade is that typically on"
"4608290","4613730"," Fed rate decision days, on Fed Minute decision days, you'll see the heads come off the market"
"4613730","4617450"," between 11.30 and 1.30. In the afternoon."
"4617810","4624110"," So if you want something on your side, the one thing I would give you would be that you typically"
"4624110","4629450"," see the heads begin to come off as we come into that Fed Minute decision."
"4636760","4640320"," But on Fed rate day, yeah, it's not really Tesla Day, is it?"
"4641200","4642460"," It's kind of Fed Minute Day. "
"4657980","4659820"," Take half, what's your white line?"
"4660340","4662660"," It's not an EMA."
"4662660","4669420"," I try to associate them with EMA's on a simplified chart on Webull for you."
"4670000","4672260"," I will get you guys something right here for you. "
"4673040","4673840"," I think it's right here."
"4681350","4684190"," Hey, Winky, do we have that white paper?"
"4689860","4690900"," Forget how to post that."
"4704510","4705210"," Thanks, Winky. "
"4710110","4711470"," Winky's always there, man."
"4713710","4716250"," Here you go, David G."
"4717690","4718770"," Read that."
"4722410","4724490"," Nice support coming into the market. "
"4729910","4732110"," Tag the lower implied move."
"4746950","4752130"," Clear down all these previous lows from the previous day."
"4753950","4756990"," One, two, and three from previous day. "
"4757590","4760610"," Had a new low on the day as well."
"4760610","4766070"," It is, my turn says the federal and provincial government spending plans are not standing in the"
"4766070","4768570"," way of getting inflation back to 2% target."
"4772350","4773170"," Winky's the man. "
"4784890","4789770"," Let's have a look here and see what spy options are doing here."
"4789850","4791630"," I'm getting frisky here."
"4792250","4793070"," Oh, no, hold on. "
"4794310","4798010"," I was trying to bring up spy options here in the background."
"4798010","4798490"," Hold on."
"4800370","4803010"," Let's see what the day is weighted on right now. "
"4807190","4809530"," Oh, 412 season, only 21 cents, huh?"
"4813070","4815330"," 271,000 calls, man."
"4815490","4817230"," Everybody's on the call side right now."
"4818170","4821890"," That's not helpful. "
"4821890","4825810"," I was hoping to see everybody on the put side here."
"4829430","4830690"," That's not helpful to see."
"4832230","4840650"," The one thing I would say to you, David, is that please read the entire thing. "
"4843050","4844410"," Don't read what you want to read."
"4844570","4845890"," Read the entire thing, please."
"4858270","4863490"," Yeah, I'm looking at, I'm looking at 412 C's on the options chain. "
"4864350","4865950"," I haven't looked at the implied move yet."
"4867210","4868430"," I'm not the implied move."
"4869330","4870210"," Hold on here. "
"4874740","4877900"," The second implied volatility right now, hang tight."
"4887430","4888230"," What chart?"
"4888530","4890750"," I'm looking for the intraday call and put buying."
"4890990","4891170"," Hold on. "
"4914990","4917710"," I'm going to do some work here in the background here."
"4938330","4940390"," Yeah, still no call buying right now."
"4942990","4943970"," This is squeezing. "
"4957170","4958350"," Maybe there is."
"4958530","4958770"," Hold on."
"4958850","4960270"," Maybe I'm messing this up here. "
"4960390","4960590"," Hold on."
"4960990","4962830"," Yeah, there's a little bit just then, but."
"4964830","4969440"," Time was that 8.30?"
"4970120","4973000"," Yeah, still no call buying right now that I can see. "
"4974880","4976320"," I think I can dump some."
"4989430","4991970"," It's getting close, but not quite there."
"4996280","4998280"," This is crazy watching this right now. "
"5002810","5004810"," I'm watching my dot."
"5022470","5029230"," Natural gas prices turned sharply lower down four spot three percent to two dollars and nine cents."
"5085190","5090790"," I'm looking at the market. "
"5091050","5093370"," How net short the market is right now."
"5094750","5095830"," It's kind of wild."
"5102230","5103690"," It's just showing melt up. "
"5103870","5104790"," It's so bad."
"5114330","5116050"," Melt up and then roll over."
"5186680","5188300"," Vic's still supportive right now. "
"5217090","5218410"," No trade for bulls currently."
"5225790","5228370"," The five minute chart still showing a trap for bulls above here."
"5240750","5242210"," The five minute chart right here. "
"5246640","5249160"," I know I can't believe we got my daughter with me today."
"5254960","5257460"," She's watching the show in the background with me today too."
"5257460","5258740"," Mom's going to be so upset with me. "
"5259560","5261200"," I told her mom like, yeah, I'm like."
"5261960","5265160"," I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, we'll just do our thing this morning."
"5281430","5282910"," Yeah, yeah, Jill. "
"5285730","5292310"," You know the hedges on the market for like between 11.30. We should start saying move higher at"
"5292310","5292770"," some point."
"5294410","5297250"," We did see here at 11.15. It started."
"5299130","5303530"," My one thing that I don't like, Jill, is the options market is long. "
"5305430","5309330"," I don't like, I want to see the options market more, more short here."
"5309890","5311650"," Not short, but long puts, not long calls."
"5313730","5314630"," They're like long. "
"5314890","5315890"," They're all long right now."
"5316670","5320990"," Whenever that happens, I'm like, yeah, I don't like it."
"5337710","5341510"," Well, what I don't like right now is everyone's long calls here. "
"5341970","5345110"," I mean, though, we got 273,000."
"5345430","5346910"," They just keep buying them too."
"5347150","5350850"," They're all buying 412 C's doubling down. "
"5352130","5353490"," I don't like seeing it."
"5353990","5356190"," I would prefer where we are right now."
"5356990","5360030"," My preference is to see us loaded to the tips on puts. "
"5361890","5364610"," And we use that as fuel to go higher."
"5372410","5373590"," On zero dates, at least."
"5418090","5420410"," Now, the intraday stuff is what I'm looking to. "
"5420570","5422170"," The intraday stuff is what I'm looking at career."
"5422890","5425250"," I'm looking at the intraday stuff and they're just loading."
"5425250","5427350"," There's load in the bow right now with calls in 412. "
"5428450","5435590"," I guess what I don't like is, I guess my question here is, do we do this nonsense today, right?"
"5435830","5436690"," Just this ping pong."
"5439170","5441870"," Just even with the minute news."
"5442070","5444870"," Let's see, we get this nice rip higher into the minutes. "
"5445170","5448050"," Well, I guess here two o'clock's over here."
"5448810","5451230"," Get that nice rip higher and then it just sells off."
"5454070","5456130"," The market is wound tightly today. "
"5473360","5477920"," Yeah, your put the call doesn't really play though into intraday stuff."
"5487650","5488450"," I'll add some on."
"5495360","5500050"," Look at the VIX really quick. "
"5521160","5522880"," They're getting counter-traded hard."
"5523200","5532100"," Yeah, there's like a, there's like a, you know, sell this and buy this going on with the implied"
"5532100","5532460"," move."
"5533860","5538520"," Unless we trade outside of this range on some news, unknown news. "
"5539300","5541840"," Kind of buy the dip, sell the rip, buy the dip, sell the rip."
"5557320","5558140"," You think it's Elon?"
"5560400","5570210"," If you want to buy calls here,"
"5570950","5577730"," if you want to buy calls here, you want to see us trade above this, this right here."
"5578170","5580070"," It's pretty fucking bearish, I'm going to be honest with you. "
"5581810","5585250"," And until we trade above it, but until we trade above the white line here."
"5586550","5592870"," I mean, there really isn't a place for you to take it without root with no risk."
"5593850","5598970"," You're looking for price to, there's a five minute try to run right now. "
"5601450","5611390"," You're looking for price to regain its composure here and retest, consolidate, and then make its"
"5611390","5612010"," move higher."
"5613290","5619090"," This is the actual trade for a bull right here, right down in here."
"5620650","5623630"," All of this stuff down here is very dangerous. "
"5623630","5628370"," You can get caught in this, caught in a consolidation."
"5635530","5640850"," If you are long right now, you don't want to trade it above 410.02 or near it."
"5656720","5662840"," Bliss is saying, hold on, I'm reading Bliss is saying, cap, can you go over how IV and days like"
"5662840","5667460"," FOMC can inflate premiums, which then get reprised lower the following day. "
"5667560","5670480"," I'm trying to figure out it's worth getting an option before close."
"5671180","5677840"," So a couple of things, Bliss is you've got the event vol that should run off the market."
"5677980","5680300"," Normally, the market will trade higher due to that. "
"5681100","5685240"," Once the event vol comes off, you should see volatility leave the market, right?"
"5686300","5688160"," So think about it to simplify it."
"5689260","5694760"," Heading into an event, there are institutions that are along the market."
"5695060","5695720"," They own the market. "
"5695860","5699460"," So let's say I own Apple, right, I own the underlying."
"5699460","5702920"," Let's say I own, I don't know, $100 million worth of Apple."
"5703960","5707460"," And we're coming into an event that we know about. "
"5709000","5714480"," There's a cheap way for me to hedge the mark or to hedge my position is, or I hedge the"
"5714480","5717140"," market in my position, right, by hedging, right?"
"5717880","5724740"," By either selling the market with being short the market for cheap puts and in the spy complex,"
"5724740","5726520"," believe it or not, right?"
"5727340","5731440"," And the moment or the close that we get to the event, I can take my hedge off."
"5732800","5735160"," Maybe I already know what the news is going to be."
"5735680","5736400"," Take my hedge off. "
"5736520","5737400"," The market squeezes higher."
"5737600","5738000"," Does that make sense?"
"5741040","5741440"," Normally."
"5741880","5746820"," Now, if there's some bad news in the market, we start trading down. "
"5747000","5752020"," They're going to sell the market, re-hedge the market, any bad news, something that didn't expect"
"5752020","5752680"," something like that."
"5752840","5756400"," They'll re-hedge the market short, sell the market short, and we'll go down, right?"
"5757420","5762580"," But if nothing is unexpected inside of the minute specifically today, you should see the market"
"5762580","5768460"," squeeze higher once people take their hedges off their long positions in the market, right?"
"5771220","5776760"," Now, inside of that event ball, you actually get to re-price two or three times."
"5777400","5782280"," You'll see the event ball come off the market as the end of the event, right?"
"5783120","5785240"," You'll actually see a re-pricing of options. "
"5785320","5788280"," This is now interest in calls, right?"
"5789160","5793220"," Not as much interest the second time around, not as much interest in put side, right?"
"5793500","5797300"," Dealers don't want to pay once participants leave the market."
"5797740","5802660"," They're not going to pay the premium that was built into those options into the market."
"5804020","5812500"," So you'll see like two or three volatility events come off, or volatility pricing of the event come"
"5812500","5815960"," off throughout the day, and then even into the following day. "
"5816160","5820400"," A way to beat that would be to, if you're like, hey, I want to buy some options and this"
"5820400","5821580"," event pisses me off."
"5822100","5824680"," You buy them farther out in time, a month, two months out in time."
"5826020","5833660"," Maybe sometimes a couple weeks, but frequently days like today, you'll also get the real move"
"5833660","5834540"," afterwards as well. "
"5834760","5836000"," Sometimes you'll hear that people talk about that."
"5836740","5842060"," So the event ball come off will squeeze higher, and the actual move is down later on in time, like"
"5842060","5843360"," tomorrow, something like that."
"5845800","5850600"," So if you're trying to like trade today and not get trapped in that event ball, you'd take like a"
"5850600","5855240"," month out position and then you'd close it before the end of today because you could get a real"
"5855240","5858040"," move that's on the reverse of whatever position you took. "
"5859620","5860700"," Does it make sense as well?"
"5861020","5868960"," If you're trading the event ball, and you don't want to get caught in the event ball or premium,"
"5870300","5871980"," then you take a farther out in time option."
"5872520","5874080"," It would be a way to combat that."
"5874840","5878240"," A spread would also help with that trade. "
"5878640","5882700"," Or you just wait for the event to cease and then come back the following day."
"5910770","5913410"," You generally just buy 11.30 and set the stop at 10%."
"5913410","5914270"," Yeah, I agree, Devin. "
"5914490","5915810"," It's a pretty fair trade, man."
"5915990","5919050"," 11.30 to 1.30. You start to see that hedge come off."
"5919970","5921570"," Someone's asking, why does it come off?"
"5922010","5923310"," Because they got paid already. "
"5924030","5928390"," They got paid to cover whatever happens inside of that trade."
"5928750","5931670"," So if you put the hedge on the market, you make your money, right?"
"5931870","5932710"," You made your money in here."
"5932770","5934750"," You put the hedge on the market above before the open. "
"5934990","5935490"," You get paid."
"5935890","5936610"," You take the hedge off."
"5936810","5941570"," You pocket that money and that's going to counter any kind of initial down move. "
"5942230","5944230"," Then you re-head share if there is bad news."
"5944550","5945050"," Does that make sense?"
"5945050","5948770"," So the hedge came on this morning above, right?"
"5948970","5949450"," You got the hedge."
"5949690","5950730"," You're printing your hedge. "
"5950730","5952910"," You take it off at 11.30 in the afternoon."
"5953470","5955990"," We start to trade higher as the event ball comes off."
"5956210","5958990"," If there's any bad news, then we start to trade down. "
"5959090","5960930"," You've already made your money here, right?"
"5961250","5962950"," On being long the market somewhere else."
"5963510","5965590"," You can re-edge hedge here and take it lower."
"5979770","5981490"," Chances would get 4.15 today. "
"5982410","5983150"," Highly unlikely."
"5983950","5987090"," I think we trade 4.12 unless there's something unknown."
"5987090","5989890"," I think we trade just below 4.12 and then we bleed off. "
"5993420","5993820"," Maybe."
"5994400","5995320"," I don't see it at least."
"6003650","6006610"," I'd like to see 4.15. I just don't think we see it. "
"6008170","6009630"," Maybe you mean on ES."
"6010030","6013730"," If you're talking about this chart down here, we can see 4.15 on ES."
"6014650","6015930"," On spy, likely not. "
"6021790","6025250"," If you're saying 4.15 on ES, that's possible."
"6036920","6041060"," 4.15 tomorrow, likely not."
"6041060","6043340"," I see us melting up, man. "
"6043600","6044480"," I kid you not."
"6044900","6045720"," It is nasty."
"6046200","6047420"," Buy dips and sell rips. "
"6051060","6053420"," I think you see 4.20 on the end of the month."
"6055660","6056220"," Hopefully."
"6069840","6070900"," Well, that's the one. "
"6071320","6078880"," My assumption here, Devon, is my assumption here is that we get those big dogs coming back in for"
"6078880","6080860"," their last pump."
"6081700","6084220"," There'll be one more rotation into those names."
"6085320","6087420"," Into that beginning of May or early May. "
"6087580","6087980"," That's the hope."
"6088900","6092120"," We've rotated out of industrials and tech, right?"
"6093060","6095840"," Both of those are getting ready almost to get back into."
"6099980","6101980"," That's my expectation is that you'll see that. "
"6102420","6105440"," That'll take us up to that 4.15, 4.20 into the month."
"6109710","6116030"," I think you need both industrials and tech, tech being the bigger driver."
"6131970","6134470"," I'll explain that well enough for you, Bliss. "
"6136950","6139950"," Like trading events like this, it's kind of hard with them."
"6141010","6148650"," If you're trading close state options on event days, there's like hard and fast rules that I use."
"6149570","6152450"," Whatever the implied move is, they tend to fail on that move. "
"6153330","6154810"," We tend to trade near it."
"6155550","6159190"," Right before you hit the money, they take it off from you."
"6161600","6162860"," We don't actually hit it. "
"6168040","6169420"," Or at least the first trip."
"6170040","6171160"," How do I explain that better?"
"6173380","6175680"," Let's say the news is positive today."
"6175840","6177200"," I would expect us to rip higher. "
"6177920","6178780"," But then you get the failure."
"6180200","6185580"," Even if you're going to go higher, it's not until they wiped out the value of these options."
"6186100","6187400"," They reprice all these options. "
"6187400","6188980"," Then they go higher."
"6189280","6195600"," So you kind of want to close that trade and then rebuy for the second rip above 4.12. So"
"6195600","6199500"," if we are going to go above 4.12, you'll see the fucking reprice every time."
"6200680","6203500"," Another famous one that likes to happen is to go up there. "
"6203640","6207500"," You won't get past the 4.12 and they'll rip it the second day."
"6207840","6209200"," So they clear out all these options."
"6209400","6212420"," It's very similar to ER reports. "
"6218570","6219350"," Yeah, an attack."
"6219670","6222370"," I think that's what we need, right, Jill?"
"6223030","6227210"," I think that if you're going to get the rotation trade, you're kind of hoping for the market to"
"6227210","6231670"," just kind of hold on long enough for that rotation trade to kick back in on tech."
"6237260","6239340"," Pretty many Fridays, baby, on tech zero dates. "
"6254890","6257430"," Tech right now is that 60%."
"6258150","6260330"," Tech and industrials are at 60%."
"6260330","6262430"," Everything else is maxed out right now. "
"6262530","6270130"," It looks like Vicks getting beaten down once again."
"6285890","6290970"," The S&P 500 typically has, yeah, let me show you guys some."
"6294550","6295610"," So the S&P 500. "
"6295810","6300090"," So the question became how does tech, how has tech been rotated out of?"
"6300850","6304410"," So the S&P 500 is made up of sectors, right?"
"6305250","6307330"," You have tech communications."
"6307650","6309910"," You've got oil."
"6310390","6312770"," You've got, you got all these different sectors of S&P 500, right?"
"6313650","6315010"," You've got, well, you've got energy. "
"6315010","6318630"," You've got discretion, consumer discretionarys."
"6319770","6322690"," Anyways, you've got different sectors of the S&P 500."
"6323590","6326490"," The stock market works in ebbs and flows. "
"6327730","6332490"," We have larger, some of these sectors weigh more heavily than other sectors."
"6333830","6339490"," And some of these sectors also are more indicative of risk on or risk off in the market."
"6340190","6341670"," Some of them are drivers of the market. "
"6341670","6347930"," So if you're at a risk on positioning, you'll see riskier sectors get traded first."
"6348670","6350130"," Typically tech is one of those."
"6350750","6352150"," So that kind of growth is one of those. "
"6353290","6357510"," So the market will rotate into being in a risk on position on a market low."
"6358250","6365410"," So you'll see those main drivers of our market heavily weighted tickers go on first, right?"
"6365410","6372470"," So we'll rotate into those tickers, i.e. let's say Nvidia or Tesla or Apple or what have you."
"6373050","6376170"," And then normally the market is not done there. "
"6376750","6382150"," There'll be other sectors that have not been rotated into in that initial bullish run."
"6383130","6389930"," So you'll see people take profit and rotate into another sector that's not as risky."
"6390470","6393150"," But they want to still have some exposure in the market, right?"
"6393270","6397810"," So you'll see a second leg for every ever notice somewhere in tops. "
"6398290","6400050"," Takes a little while for us to come back down."
"6400510","6402750"," And then we capitulate it's the elevator down, right?"
"6403730","6405690"," So you'll see the market hold up longer."
"6406930","6410190"," And then we'll rotate into other sectors of the S&P 500. "
"6411710","6418110"," Now, while all that rotation is happening, sometimes we'll get a capitulation phase, right?"
"6418110","6419290"," Rotated through every sector."
"6419790","6423770"," We'll begin to sell out of each sector all at the same time."
"6423810","6424590"," It's some kind of unison. "
"6424930","6427730"," You'll find a little bit of money will be left hanging out and let's say utilities."
"6430850","6431870"," Another sector or two."
"6432450","6434790"," And these are all risk off sectors. "
"6435030","6436790"," You'll see money still sitting in the market."
"6437730","6441990"," And then so, and once in a while, you'll see a capitulation or a liquidation phase."
"6442230","6443230"," Sometimes you do not. "
"6444410","6450290"," Now, you're tracking price of the S&P 500 to see if we get that liquidation phase or not."
"6451030","6452990"," If we don't, trend is still on."
"6454090","6457490"," And we'll begin to re-rotate back into tech. "
"6459450","6460570"," So you're going to expect."
"6461410","6466650"," If we don't get a liquidation phase, you'll expect the market to continue higher, grind higher."
"6467870","6469870"," And that's what the idea that Joe and I are talking about. "
"6469870","6473090"," Would be you'd have that little bit of weakness into the middle of April."
"6473710","6475990"," We won't have a liquidation phase in the market."

"7413390","7413950"," Consistently."
"7414130","7415910"," I'm looking for consistency here, right?"
"7416910","7418570"," Where do I see the rollover?"

"7421710","7422970"," Market rolling lower. "
"7424210","7424770"," Right?"
"7427370","7428930"," What about this one right here?"
"7435700","7436980"," Look at that one right there."
"7437700","7438840"," Market rolling over."
"7439140","7441240"," And even on this one we didn't get to a new low did we?"
"7441880","7442720"," This is 1990. "
"7443800","7445260"," Unemployment rate rising."
"7445540","7447600"," More consistent than fed funds rate, right?"
"7448140","7449820"," For market crash we're talking about."
"7450920","7451400"," Right?"
"7451520","7452260"," Look at this one right here. "
"7452400","7453560"," This is back in 1981."
"7454900","7455860"," Unemployment rate."
"7457020","7458540"," Initially we grind higher. "
"7459100","7460720"," We actually saw a low on the initial one."
"7461200","7462720"," So our crash on the initial push."
"7463560","7464600"," Play rate came back down. "
"7465740","7466200"," Grind it higher."
"7466700","7468120"," But then we got another low right here."
"7468220","7470340"," But this is the unemployment rate going higher again. "
"7471360","7473760"," It's not the Fed rate cuts is it?"
"7475780","7476660"," This one right here."
"7477960","7479900"," Unemployment rate screaming higher."
"7480540","7481060"," Right?"

"7502670","7504210"," We're not so much the same thing back here. "
"7504470","7504530"," Right?"
"7505210","7506490"," Fed fund rate though climbing."
"7507530","7507750"," Right?"

"7508930","7510030"," Fed fund rate climbing. "
"7510030","7512570"," This is back when we have the 50s and 60s right?"
"7513230","7515070"," So back here we've got Fed funds rate."
"7515790","7516610"," Crank the rates."
"7516930","7517370"," Pause them. "

"7529210","7530350"," Crank unemployment rate."
"7530690","7533450"," Skyrockets still these lows aren't crashes though."
"7533770","7534050"," Are they?"
"7534190","7535530"," This is the no landing scenario. "
"7536030","7539110"," This is the 3200 3400 scenario."
"7539450","7539610"," Right?"
"7540870","7542570"," Unemployment rate coming back down."
"7542670","7543970"," Market explodes higher. "

"7544690","7546810"," This is the 50s 60s."
"7547210","7547510"," Right?"
"7547790","7549610"," Notice these lows are higher lows."
"7549950","7550650"," They're not crazy. "
"7550670","7551050"," Right?"
"7551170","7552210"," If you didn't buy in 62."
"7552690","7554070"," Once the time we got to 74."
"7554730","7556070"," You still didn't have that low. "
"7556170","7557730"," These are viable dips in the market."
"7557890","7560650"," You see these 1950s 60s 70s."
"7560690","7564130"," This is implying that any lows that we have in the market. "
"7564130","7565610"," If we go back to that system."
"7566550","7569790"," Into that you'd be trade like this if we extend this."
"7569970","7570110"," Right?"
"7570510","7572510"," We'd trade it to the right and up. "
"7573590","7574470"," Over years."
"7574870","7575910"," Five years 10 years."
"7576130","7577070"," I don't think we do this shit. "
"7577230","7578730"," But if we were to do it."
"7579190","7581390"," You're not going to expect the market."
"7582370","7582810"," To. "
"7583510","7583670"," Crash."
"7584510","7586570"," Now unemployment rate on its own."
"7586910","7588470"," Is that showing a crash right now?"
"7588510","7589970"," Do you guys see unemployment rate?"
"7590890","7592330"," I don't see unemployment rate crash there. "
"7592430","7592670"," Do you?"
"7593490","7594810"," I'm not seeing it right here."
"7595850","7597550"," I'm not seeing the unemployment rate."
"7597710","7598950"," Green out of control. "
"7600230","7600510"," Right?"
"7600730","7607670"," Remember the Fed saying their main job is to maintain a high rate of employment."
"7610670","7613290"," So am I seeing a crash right now in the market?"
"7613490","7613850"," Is the question?"
"7614390","7616230"," I'm going to do the 10s and 2s here for a minute for you."
"7616710","7619230"," Because I know you guys are all I know you guys are all harping on that too. "
"7619350","7620370"," Let me clear this out real quick."
"7623570","7624570"," Move these drawings."
"7626590","7627790"," So I'm not seeing it. "
"7627910","7628430"," I'm not seeing it."
"7628630","7629370"," I'm not seeing a consistent."
"7631090","7633710"," Answer just based on inflation. "
"7634730","7636250"," That funds rate unemployment."
"7636890","7637590"," The only consistent."
"7638830","7640510"," Crash scenario that I see. "
"7641270","7642270"," Like crash."
"7643270","7645130"," Not we're training down a 3400."
"7645590","7647190"," Not we're trading down a 30. "
"7647490","7648730"," Let me put this back up."
"7652150","7655130"," Not we're training down to 3200."
"7655710","7656150"," 3400. "
"7656210","7657110"," I'm talking like 2,800."
"7657990","7658630"," 2,400."
"7659670","7660050"," 1,600. "
"7661490","7662870"," Like doom and gloom collapse bears."
"7663610","7665510"," I don't see it in less than employment is coming up."
"7666010","7669930"," And we haven't seen unemployment just start ramping. "
"7670090","7670190"," Right?"
"7671050","7673210"," Because we're all the mechanics of the market."
"7673750","7675070"," The business cycle."
"7675290","7676190"," The economic cycle. "
"7676630","7678090"," None of that is matching up to."
"7679590","7682530"," COVID and that's why they're funny thing people out there like well."
"7683450","7685450"," I'm going to I'm going to compare this chart. "
"7685990","7691230"," To every other downturn, but not COVID and I'm like, why are you not doing COVID in this?"
"7692010","7694430"," Everything right now is against COVID."
"7694610","7697390"," This whole fucking trade involves the COVID trade."
"7699530","7705190"," So if you're like, so if you're like, Hey, we're going to we're going to talk about how the normal"
"7705190","7705950"," cycle works. "
"7705950","7710290"," I'm like, yeah, I get the normal cycle or not in a normal cycle."
"7711550","7713730"," We weren't in a normal rip in the market either."
"7716470","7721170"," So none of the function none of the if you look at an engine in this in all of this"
"7721170","7725830"," economy, the macro, the stock market, the bond market, all this shit. "
"7726490","7730670"," None of it's really running on its normal cylinders, right?"
"7731110","7733630"," Pistons aren't running the pump."
"7733630","7736750"," They all aren't running all in the same system like they normally do."
"7739430","7743550"," We're still not seeing that employment rate going crazy right now, right?"
"7743770","7748090"," We have tools for monetary policy and financial stability and they don't compete with each other. "
"7751090","7756610"," So for right now, if you're looking for that trade, I don't see it."
"7757650","7760750"," Now you guys, I'll talk about the inverted yield curve."
"7789390","7794770"," That daily says I can bring this up to end 2023, a little above 3%. "
"7828250","7833610"," And that daily says inflation expectations are anchored and allowing us to take a couple of years"
"7833610","7834610"," to bring down inflation."
"7868190","7873410"," And that daily says policy tightening is at the point now where we don't expect to continue to"
"7873410","7874710"," raise rates every meeting."
"7874710","7879810"," That's said, daily saying policy tightening is at a point now, but we don't expect to continue"
"7879810","7881330"," raising rates every meeting. "
"7881770","7884590"," There is a sense that we will get rates up to a level and stay."
"7890330","7891170"," Great study."
"7895910","7900210"," And that daily does say that I don't want to forecast the end of the tightening cycle. "
"7902350","7907040"," Thank you."
"7908540","7911160"," I'll bring up my regular card here."
"7912380","7913180"," Just forget. "
"7959010","7960110"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"7961270","7964010"," That daily does say we had good news today on inflation."
"7978580","7984280"," And that daily says we will look in CPI inflation to see if core services, egg housing are coming"
"7984280","7984540"," down. "
"7985140","7987800"," Does the CPI really showed good news, but is still elevated."
"7990320","8005450"," That daily"
"8005450","8009750"," says we are getting signs of a cooling in the labor market, but again, we're not there yet."
"8011990","8024420"," I think"
"8024420","8026080"," I'm bringing this up back up for you for a minute. "
"8030600","8036180"," For some reason, a brain can't figure out how to put this at a different scale right now, but"
"8036180","8036960"," whatever it doesn't matter."
"8039060","8041700"," This is the SPX S&P 500."
"8042260","8063030"," It's done a weekly yield curve. "
"8063390","8064930"," So I got SPX down below here."
"8064990","8067050"," You can't see it, but this is where my cursor is."
"8067470","8068830"," This is SPX down here. "
"8069690","8070770"," And they can move this up."
"8075370","8079050"," Front move to existing and painting above."
"8080370","8081850"," No, no, no, no, no. "
"8083570","8084970"," No, no, no, no."
"8084990","8085550"," It's PIX."
"8089850","8094490"," It's daily says there's a lot of uncertainty about how long it takes to rate hike to impact the"
"8094490","8094870"," economy. "
"8101630","8103210"," So let's take a look right now."
"8103230","8106650"," Let's just take a look right now at this general idea."
"8108530","8109970"," So I want you to see. "
"8110190","8111490"," So this is SPX down below."
"8111490","8113130"," just time frame wise, okay?"
"8114050","8116770"," And let's look at the yield curve here."
"8116970","8118850"," So we've got the yield curve right above, okay?"
"8119790","8121450"," What I want you to see is in a time frame. "
"8124150","8125810"," Let's talk about time frames here."
"8125970","8127150"," So we've got the yield curve here."
"8127350","8128810"," Everyone's like, ah, it's gonna go straight north. "
"8129270","8130670"," And I'm like, eh, maybe not."
"8130870","8133330"," This is 2004 or 24."
"8134050","8135250"," This is a year from now. "
"8137030","8137710"," Yield curve."
"8139250","8142930"," Contrayed sideways and up for some time frame, right?"
"8144650","8146210"," Here's the yield curve back here."
"8146330","8151690"," This is February of 2006 into July. "
"8152310","8156570"," And even over here into October of 2007."
"8157450","8162330"," You can actually see right here, we grind sideways and up."
"8162610","8165970"," If you look, what following my cursor, you'll see the market grind sideways and up. "
"8166430","8171010"," And doesn't begin to actually roll over until the yield curve really starts to blast."
"8171850","8175550"," So the yield curve is up here and then it's actually starting to peak above."
"8176430","8178450"," So if you're trying to be like, yeah, the yield curve, man. "
"8178610","8179470"," Yield curve is gonna do it."
"8179550","8181130"," Yield curve is gonna crash this market over."
"8181730","8185030"," Historically, the yield curve does not actually translate. "
"8185970","8186690"," Well, here we go."
"8186690","8191870"," We got an example here in 2000 where it did, but this is the start of the rollover in 2000,"
"8191870","8192549"," right?"
"8192870","8197110"," See how the yield curve didn't really play a part in the rollover in 2000, right?"
"8197250","8200610"," We began to rollover due to the unemployment rate."
"8201510","8203350"," So the yield curve kind of did its own thing. "
"8203549","8206590"," See how you can't really trust the yield curve is my point."
"8207090","8208350"," You can't trust it."
"8208870","8210290"," Now you're gonna get bears out there. "
"8210290","8212430"," They're gonna tell you, well, we're just at the start of the crash."
"8213129","8216610"," I'm like, nah, we already, you guys already tried to say we came down here at this point."
"8217190","8219270"," The yield curve hadn't already come up at this point. "
"8219629","8224110"," So the yield curve is kind of an inaccurate representation of, yeah, the yield curve is how we're"
"8224110","8227090"," gonna find out when and if the market crashes."
"8228309","8229450"," Same thing back here."
"8229610","8230770"," This is 1990. "
"8232170","8234730"," Yield curve, raising over here, right?"
"8235430","8236570"," You can see it right here."
"8236809","8237190"," Yield curve."
"8237450","8238629"," See how it's going up right now?"
"8238790","8241850"," And the market peaks and rolls over, right?"
"8242150","8243830"," We get no rollover here. "
"8244290","8245850"," And then all of a sudden we get a rollover there."
"8246049","8247530"," Can't really rely upon it, can you?"
"8247709","8251230"," Two's and 10's, 10's and 2's, can't rely upon 10's and 2's."
"8251770","8253510"," You see it blasting up here, right?"
"8253510","8254809"," Watch it blast up here. "
"8255010","8258170"," And the market is coming up as it blasts up."
"8258309","8262709"," So I guess that point by the 10 and 2, to you is that you can't trust it as a"
"8262709","8267290"," reliable indicator of the market going higher or lower."
"8267830","8271809"," And a lot of people here will say to you, well, if the 10's and 2's come up, you should"
"8271809","8273030"," expect a market crash. "
"8274070","8279629"," And I'm like, eh, if you did, it wouldn't even be until the 10's and 2's are way up here."
"8279950","8284830"," That still says to me that this year alone, we will likely go higher."
"8286870","8287309"," You okay?"
"8287670","8288209"," You gonna do some one?"
"8289850","8294990"," So my point here is that 10's and 2's are not going to be the signifier for you for market"
"8294990","8296950"," crash, market too. "
"8297049","8301049"," If you look back historically on the S&P 500, it's a poor indicator."
"8302150","8306590"," Poor indicator for when the market crashes."
"8307049","8314430"," The best indicator for when the market crashes, as we all know, is definitely when the unemployment"
"8314430","8319170"," rate matches up with the 10's and 2's. "
"8319530","8321070"," So what are you looking for now?"
"8321209","8327770"," You're looking for the 10's and 2's to rise with the 10's and 2's."
"8327950","8332510"," Unemployment rate to rise with the 10's and 2's."
"8332590","8339490"," So until you see the unemployment rate go up, the 10's and 2's on their own, do not make sense. "
"8340090","8341790"," I think that was my comment on."
"8342049","8345209"," That's daily said when credit conditions touch and it puts the brakes on the economy."
"8345549","8347750"," So the Fed doesn't have to touch it anymore. "
"8349709","8350510"," On Fintuit."
"8350770","8355650"," On Fintuit I had said to you, 10's and 2's really don't tell you on their own that the market"
"8355650","8357010"," is going to go up or down."
"8357350","8358070"," If you look at that. "
"8358209","8360990"," I want to thanks to recalibrate lending to the economic outlook."
"8361510","8366350"," If you look at the 10's and 2's on their own, they're a poor indicator for where the market goes."
"8366350","8371430"," So if you're a bear and you want that collapse in the market, what do you want to see?"

"8380190","8385230"," At least for macro reasons, you want to see the Fed funds rate."
"8386010","8388770"," Oh, excuse me, the Fed funds rate, not pause."
"8390010","8391630"," Not continue to raise rates. "
"8392270","8395130"," You want to see the Fed funds rate be cut, right?"
"8395130","8396290"," Rates being cut."
"8396910","8403530"," You want to see that Fed fund rate being cut once the rate of inflation is lower than the Fed"
"8403530","8404850"," fund rate as well, right?"
"8405010","8407330"," You want to see the Fed funds rate go above the rate of inflation."
"8408050","8410450"," You want to see inflation truly come down. "
"8410930","8417530"," I want you to know that because the Fed balance sheet has been higher, that we're not above the"
"8417530","8420670"," federal fund, the rate of inflation, right?"
"8420850","8423810"," You're probably going to see a spike of inflation."
"8424240","8430630"," You also know that because we're not above the rate of inflation in rates, that the money is worth"
"8430630","8430970"," less."
"8432200","8434850"," It's worth less over time. "
"8436800","8440890"," We're not seeing the unemployment rate screaming out of control right now."
"8441570","8445210"," And we're not seeing inflation coming down drastically."
"8448880","8450790"," So what does the 10s and 2s means?"
"8451370","8451730"," Nothing. "
"8452190","8457050"," It means that rich people are probably long bonds and want to get paid."
"8457830","8458690"," That's what they want to do."
"8458830","8459510"," They want to get paid. "
"8461050","8464110"," They're long high quality bonds and they want it today."
"8464810","8465550"," That's all it means."
"8465830","8470690"," It's some human that wants paid in the bond market. "
"8470970","8471630"," That's all it means."
"8474100","8477340"," Oh, yeah, baby, trading 32 cents right now."
"8479100","8480240"," That's all it means. "
"8480860","8485120"," In the fly in the ointment right now is the Fed is f-ing over."
"8485240","8486340"," See, I didn't swear that time."
"8487020","8490220"," F-ing over bond buyers. "
"8490800","8492620"," High quality bond buyers."
"8494340","8500760"," They did not expect, I don't believe for a minute that they expected the Fed to support regional"
"8500760","8501220"," banks."
"8502020","8505620"," I think if we have a commercial back, real estate loans, right?"
"8505780","8513520"," If we have a crisis there, we got to bail out the people that own commercial buildings in downtown"
"8513520","8516940"," L.A. in New York, and we're going to support them. "
"8517980","8520380"," That's a fly in the ointment for the bond market."
"8522400","8523740"," We're going to pause rates."
"8524040","8526460"," That's a fly in the ointment for the bond market. "
"8528020","8531860"," We're going to talk about it, talk about it, fly in the ointment."
"8533220","8538800"," We're not going to cut rates and we're probably going to increase rates, 25 VPS next month and then"
"8538800","8540720"," we'll pause it for the rest of the summer."
"8541080","8550660"," None of that jives, none of what I just said, jives at all, with what a bear wants to hear. "
"8552360","8556940"," A bear wants to hear, we're above the rate of inflation with rates."
"8558240","8561200"," We are blasting these companies and they're failing."
"8561920","8563840"," We have mass unemployment. "
"8565000","8567280"," You guys getting the picture here, right?"
"8568540","8573180"," The fed must cut rates because they've done too much damage that we haven't seen yet."
"8574180","8578700"," Until you see that stuff, the tens and twos don't mean shit."
"8582060","8584000"," They don't mean shit on their own. "
"8587940","8591880"," And so if you're a bull or a bear, you know, bulls want a bottom two."
"8592640","8595240"," It's not like, it's not just bears that want to see a market crash."
"8595420","8599000"," We want to see that bottom two, but we're not seeing it, are we?"
"8600320","8607080"," We're seeing a supportive fed that's telling you that the bottom is likely in, even if we trade"
"8607080","8610640"," down to 320, it's close enough and horseshoes and the anger nades. "
"8611360","8615680"," And they're going to be supportive of the market as they do their operations."
"8616700","8621080"," They'll pause and they'll add and they'll pause and you're going to have to play ball and suffer"
"8621080","8621680"," through it all."
"8622300","8629280"," And the worst part about all of this is likely down the road two things are working against you. "
"8629820","8634520"," And that is that you're eventually just going to fucking, my daughter's not here right now."
"8634860","8642420"," You're just going to accept eggs or six fucking dollars and you're going to have politics come into"
"8642420","8647400"," the most stock market and you're gonna get somebody running for office and they're gonna tell you"
"8647400","8648700"," some other stupid shit."
"8648860","8654320"," Like, hey, we're gonna get everybody making 20, 25 dollars an hour. "
"8654860","8657020"," We're gonna make the rich people get rich again."
"8657580","8662140"," We're gonna roll back all these tax programs and you're gonna be then what?"
"8662420","8667760"," You're gonna now make 20, if you're working at McDonald's, you're gonna make 20, $30 an hour and"
"8667760","8673960"," they're gonna take taxes off the rich and the market's gonna move on and you're gonna be robbed and"
"8673960","8681320"," the fraud's gonna go on, the fraud's gonna continue, the modern monetary theory is gonna slip back"
"8681320","8687000"," into the system and they're gonna snort the cocaine and all that kind of stuff and you're gonna"
"8687000","8688620"," rage as it happens."
"8689560","8691720"," That is likely what is going to happen. "
"8695040","8695840"," She's not in here."
"8696280","8696880"," She's gone."
"8697680","8698300"," She's upstairs. "
"8700120","8702420"," She's making herself a sandwich right now."
"8707550","8708710"," Thanks for saying something."
"8709490","8710970"," She's not in the room at the moment. "
"8711630","8712250"," So I can swear."
"8714270","8715450"," You get my point though?"
"8716090","8717250"," Hopefully you get my point."
"8721170","8722950"," So what does that lead us back to?"
"8723050","8727370"," That leads us back to, do we get the sell and make?"
"8727670","8727870"," Probably. "
"8728790","8729850"," Is it gonna be end of the world?"
"8730090","8730930"," Probably not."
"8731730","8733670"," Does it give another dip for a bull to buy?"
"8733910","8734710"," Probably yes."
"8736250","8738290"," Have we seen mass unemployment figures?"
"8738830","8738910"," No. "
"8739170","8739710"," And I don't care."
"8740310","8746670"," I don't care what like, I was reading a story the other day where people are like, they get the"
"8746670","8750530"," chalkboard out and the arrows going and they're like, like, well, this is the real unemployment"
"8750530","8751110"," rate."
"8751950","8753630"," And they're like, this is the real inflation rate. "
"8754250","8755330"," And I'm like, yeah, you know what?"
"8755750","8760510"," These guys and these women in the Fed don't care about your charts."
"8761190","8762010"," They don't care."
"8766140","8767740"," They don't, they don't care. "
"8768580","8769820"," They want mass on them."
"8769900","8771160"," You need to see mass unemployment."
"8773560","8777200"," You need to see wage, stack inflation, inflation raging. "
"8779180","8779800"," You're not seeing it."
"8787190","8790250"," Kaido is asking how come I'm very delayed on your end?"
"8791310","8796970"," You should be able to go right down to the, you should go right down into your, your preferences"
"8796970","8798590"," cog and you just click on it."
"8799430","8802210"," That's daily says most likely there will be no recession. "
"8802590","8804470"," Speed up playback and you should be real time with me."
"8804730","8805870"," Twitch has a five second delay."
"8807130","8808670"," And you can always go to Twitch and watch me there. "
"8814830","8816810"," Hit that playback speed, baby."
"8830890","8832210"," Oh, you know, I'll have her sing that."
"8832390","8833710"," When she comes back, I'll have her sing that. "
"8833850","8834550"," What a bear wants."
"8835090","8835650"," What a bear needs."
"8840250","8842530"," You can always take the two trades here. "
"8842810","8844810"," There's, you can take both of these trades, right?"
"8844970","8848950"," Where we are, you can take a, a, a straddle or a strangle."
"8850010","8852150"," Take both sides of his trades, manage both sides."
"8854630","8854950"," Easily. "
"8855490","8858750"," Throw my favorite trades on a Vente's."
"8863900","8864940"," See, I'm not seeing it."
"8865060","8870980"," I don't know where, I don't know where, like at least macro wise, I'm not seeing the trade"
"8870980","8872080"," everybody's talking about. "
"8872900","8874340"," At least from a macro perspective."
"8875780","8883420"," So if I can't see it with macro stuff, well, if I can't see it with the inverted yield curve,"
"8883880","8888380"," like consistently, can't consistently say, yeah, the yield curve goes up and the market's gonna"
"8888380","8888620"," crash."
"8889140","8892180"," Yeah, I can't time the yield curve going up. "
"8893040","8899800"," Or at least not on a month to month, three month projection, six months projection, can't see it,"
"8899800","8901340"," not consistently."
"8901800","8902180"," It's contracting."
"8903600","8906420"," Can't see it with where the unemployment rate is right now. "
"8906980","8909080"," Now that's the most consistent way to see it."
"8909580","8912560"," With all of it combined, I can't see it right now."
"8912800","8916800"," Can't see that like, that like, this is the top we're gonna crash tomorrow. "
"8916880","8918720"," I mean, crash, not we're pulling back."
"8919580","8921560"," Now we're gonna trade down to 3,200."
"8921940","8924920"," I mean, the second leg down that everybody talks about. "
"8925180","8926340"," I can't see that right now."
"8928320","8930860"," This looks like the environment of by a dip."
"8931800","8932740"," That's what it looks like. "
"8936830","8938790"," Do I make any money off of YouTuber Twitch?"
"8939150","8945710"," No, YouTube and Twitch, I make minimal, 30 bucks a month, something like that."
"8946250","8948430"," 20, I do better with recorded videos."
"8948690","8950090"," I make a lot of money if I did recorded videos. "
"8950390","8952190"," And I haven't done any sponsorships."
"8952430","8957930"," This is completely, everything that we do is completely community supported."
"8958810","8962010"," So no, I've been doing this for a long time now. "
"8962310","8964810"," It costs a lot of money, not to do so."
"8964930","8966450"," This is completely community supported."
"8972120","8976020"," There's a holy chrisana saying you can click low latency mode also in Twitch and you'll get less"
"8976020","8976880"," than a second delay. "
"8981790","8982810"," Thanks for the heads up."
"8982950","8983810"," It was a holy croissant."
"8984910","8985610"," Cross-fault. "
"8990260","8991020"," Yeah, no, Brian."
"8992580","8996340"," I'm trying to do, I'm trying, we're rolling out a website right now."
"8996500","8998580"," The economy is going to slow quite substantially. "
"8999580","9007340"," I'm hoping to monetize this where you can get buy for free if you want to."
"9008960","9010280"," And there's a paid option."
"9011460","9013020"," But we're not, we're very close. "
"9013020","9016160"," We're like, keto, very, very close."
"9017300","9019100"," That has to get monetized at some point."
"9019180","9020760"," Otherwise I can't keep doing what I do. "
"9022120","9026620"," It's been, I'm getting crispy."
"9027800","9032620"," I'm getting to that point where they're impacting my private life."
"9033840","9035620"," And it's impacted trading too. "
"9036200","9038000"," It's impacted trading, private life, all that kind of stuff."
"9038720","9045120"," So it has to at some point grow into something self-sustainable or probably needs to end at some"
"9045120","9045380"," point."
"9045920","9046780"," So it's going to be one or the other. "
"9051300","9052080"," Yeah, yeah."
"9052360","9057440"," But I've got, I've had sponsor offers that stream will change."
"9057660","9059300"," If we do that stuff, the stream will change. "
"9060260","9067360"," Like you end up getting like a diluted version of me and then you'll end up getting less and less"
"9067360","9067620"," conviction."
"9068820","9072720"," You'll get if this than that or these are the three options that we can do here."
"9074300","9077400"," So you're going to, you'll lose some of the teeth from Moody's. "
"9077480","9079940"," So it's the baseline US macro forecast is unchanged."
"9080140","9082040"," But the outlook is now more uncertain."
"9082760","9083700"," Yeah, I love you guys. "
"9083960","9084760"," I love being here."
"9084860","9085780"," It's not that I don't love you guys."
"9085780","9086460"," I love all you guys. "
"9086480","9087380"," We're in the entire world."
"9087380","9088460"," It's sponsored by Tick Strike."
"9089100","9090600"," We're just at that place, you know. "
"9090880","9098440"," We're right at that place where we need to make that move up or scale it way, way, way back."
"9098680","9099740"," So we're working out in the background."
"9100740","9104180"," It's cost money time and all that other kind of stuff to get there. "
"9104280","9105000"," So we're kind of there."
"9105140","9105860"," So I appreciate you asking."
"9106260","9107040"," Thanks for asking. "
"9112330","9114690"," Chris Sant means Crescent Moon, the symbol of the Ottomans."
"9116930","9118830"," No sense of recovering as a daughter's in the room."
"9119370","9120890"," So I keep right here more frequently. "
"9121130","9121670"," I can do that."
"9122670","9128050"," We'll end up turning her into a market practitioner at 10 years old."
"9129730","9131010"," That would be bad, right?"
"9131690","9134630"," They'll make like a documentary on her one day down the road. "
"9135650","9139770"," It'd be like, we actually have a video of when she was eight or nine years old sitting with her"
"9139770","9141290"," old man all day long, 10 years."
"9145770","9147310"," I love all of you guys too."
"9148270","9150110"," More commentary from Moody's on the US economy. "
"9150630","9154950"," Just the recent banking stress is likely to add to the financial tightening that was already"
"9154950","9155330"," underway."
"9155890","9159530"," As the Holy Cross salt is French, red on."
"9166270","9172050"," Did you guys hear the, did you guys hear the song that I posted on Fintuit this morning?"
"9172670","9173570"," I thought it was funny. "
"9178200","9180600"," Is it possible to set up spy stream?"
"9181720","9186260"," You set the spy stream, walk away on your days off and get inflation down."
"9187020","9188800"," It isn't, it isn't."
"9189180","9190280"," That's a good question. "
"9190580","9193660"," So some mornings like have the opportunity this past week, I have not."
"9194420","9198880"," We have been up and out of the house in the mornings at like 6.37 in the morning."
"9199300","9202140"," So it's like, we've dodged dodging and we've it's like an hour. "
"9202280","9204440"," I've had to take to set up the stream for you every day."
"9204840","9209700"," But I want to get to that point that I can for you, but not quite right now."
"9210060","9212060"," But yes, we are working on that. "
"9212440","9218040"," I do actually have someone that I'm trying to teach, turn the stream on for me."
"9218760","9222500"," The issue is that if I can't do it myself, it's not being set up properly."
"9226790","9231490"," Moody's adding that as long as systemic risks moderate additional negative impact on the US GDP"
"9231490","9234490"," growth in the recent banking stress will likely be modest. "
"9244250","9245710"," Hey, Supermash, how are you doing, man?"
"9247850","9248950"," No, we're going to keep it going."
"9249310","9253050"," It's all good in the background where we got a lot of stuff going on the background for you guys,"
"9253490","9254170"," it's not ending."
"9254410","9255290"," So it'll all be good. "
"9255450","9257010"," We'll be here, I promise."
"9260930","9264990"," Yeah, her mother today is going to be upset."
"9264990","9275490"," It's probably it's a no, no, no, no, this"
"9275490","9277290"," is YouTube, Winky, YouTube. "
"9280920","9287500"," And I haven't checked, I haven't checked which to see what that is right now, but I will look which"
"9287500","9290300"," I haven't checked, which doesn't if they do send me a check."
"9290480","9295100"," I don't know if I've received it or not, but YouTube, I haven't seen nothing."
"9296740","9300100"," YouTube's like for all the advertising and YouTube's like 30 bucks or something. "
"9301040","9301580"," I'll look right now."
"9311110","9312670"," You'll look right now and see what it was."
"9314370","9318070"," And it's the it's the structure of the videos because they're live streams. "
"9318390","9322450"," If they were like a 20 minute 30 minute video every night, people go back and watch them, watch"
"9322450","9323770"," them, watch them, watch them, watch them."
"9324390","9325310"," Take a look right now."
"9325410","9333410"," Yeah, it's not a check. "
"9333690","9337250"," It's like a I think Twitch actually sends a check."
"9337690","9338690"," They give you the option, I think."
"9340470","9342330"," I think they actually give you that option. "
"9342510","9345110"," I think that comes but it comes through like every two months or something."
"9350690","9353490"," But they ban you if they say if you show analytics on stream."
"9354390","9355750"," Okay, I didn't know that. "
"9356210","9357350"," All right, maybe I won't show analytics."
"9360550","9362130"," I'm just going to see check YouTube."
"9369940","9370700"," That's the other thing. "
"9370780","9375360"," YouTube like mixes ad revenue and tips."
"9375360","9378820"," I'm not optimistic about labor participation growing further."
"9381480","9383200"," Yeah, they kind of like they kind of like. "
"9384400","9387560"," Yeah, see the see here."
"9390820","9391660"," Actually, it's higher."
"9391940","9398040"," So watch page ads was a hundred and forty seven dollars for the last month. "
"9399360","9403920"," They estimated her forty seven dollars extra much higher than it used to be."
"9404520","9406080"," Quite a quite impressed on that."
"9409070","9410830"," I impressed that it's actually gone up. "
"9411670","9412310"," That's good."
"9413010","9414230"," I guess I am doing better."
"9414350","9415310"," Maybe I'm not paying attention. "
"9417010","9418390"," We need to pay more attention."
"9421330","9423630"," I've been able to monetize shorts on YouTube."
"9423930","9424510"," Yeah, I have. "
"9424590","9429890"," So I've got two guys working on doing shorts so that we can clip live streams and then start to"
"9429890","9430410"," post them."
"9431070","9432850"," It's just a matter of getting there and doing it."
"9433490","9435090"," All the pieces are there. "
"9435950","9441630"," So ASVP 19, all the pieces are there to monetize."
"9441890","9443430"," We just haven't monetized this point."
"9443830","9444810"," Squeezing higher now. "
"9445570","9449150"," Four twelve C's only trading thirty three cents currently, even on that squeeze."
"9450830","9452450"," So not too great right now."
"9453070","9454730"," One minute chart bullish right now. "
"9455710","9456790"," Five minute chart."
"9463620","9465000"," Yeah, I think I got to call you."
"9467590","9469210"," Nice big green ball right there. "
"9471940","9473900"," Five minutes looking nice and bullish here."
"9475040","9476520"," Hourly is being respected."
"9479440","9483100"," We have the confirmation trade for a bullish trade higher so far. "
"9484960","9487080"," Have that nice squeeze up one, two."
"9488100","9489900"," Looking to maintain price higher."
"9490280","9491020"," Watch that one minute. "
"9491840","9493800"," In the five minute trade above here."
"9496290","9498550"," Give me just two minutes here."
"9498890","9500090"," Twelve forty eight. "
"9500090","9501170"," Give me just five minutes."
"9501610","9503070"," I want you to know that I am long calls."
"9505490","9510510"," I have to think my daughter is getting herself lunch and she's been gone for like five minutes, ten"
"9510510","9510750"," minutes. "
"9511370","9514550"," So I just want to make sure that she's being successful in her."
"9514670","9515430"," And never here."
"9522040","9524180"," Does three trigger cluster matter today?"
"9524520","9529100"," It does and it doesn't macro news matters most today. "
"9529240","9530040"," I want you to know that."
"9530140","9533660"," Today is the day for the Fed minutes."
"9534160","9535840"," That is the most critical part today. "
"9538350","9539050"," Good question."
"9539210","9539730"," Uncle J."
"9539850","9539910"," B."
"9540010","9540170"," J."
"9544010","9545790"," Give me just one moment here."
"9550260","9552900"," And I'm going to go check on my daughter really quickly. "
"9558140","9558840"," Hey, thanks, Wesley."
"9559080","9559720"," I appreciate it."
"9563130","9564090"," I appreciate it, Wesley. "
"9565670","9566670"," Is it we see?"
"9567450","9568170"," We see."
"9568730","9569290"," I appreciate it."
"9569290","9569590"," We see. "
"9578910","9579830"," Yeah, I'll be right here."
"9579830","9580530"," Give me a two minutes."
"9580710","9581130"," I'll be right back. "
"9581290","9581950"," Just two minutes."
"9582990","9585090"," Usually if I step away, the market squeezes."
"9585230","9587790"," So hopefully that happens again right now. "
"9594210","9598330"," Trying to gift subs but keep running into issues with which payment can't be processed."
"9599410","9599950"," Uh oh."
"9603730","9604670"," Off that check. "
"9607660","9609480"," Let me see if we can help out with that."

"9611960","9613860"," The holy croissant saying. "
"9614500","9618460"," Keep trying to get subs but keeps running into issues with which payment can't be processed."
"9620740","9621940"," Hello, one second of Ray back."
"9622060","9623880"," It's a way from the top of the hour. "
"9624160","9627400"," We do have the U.S. selling 32 billion dollars in 10 year notes."
"9628120","9628440"," To the private."
"9628720","9629620"," I saw that. "
"9629620","9630080"," It says."
"9630260","9630380"," Right."
"9631400","9633720"," The order three spots nine eight five percent. "
"9634160","9636600"," They're just looking at an auction preview ahead of this."
"9636940","9641860"," So JP Morgan strapped this to the auction as requiring further concession from Tuesday's closing"
"9641860","9644960"," level given rich valuations and a weak risk appetite."
"9645540","9650920"," So against the curve the two 10 spread is steeper by one around one spot by basis point from the"
"9650920","9651100"," day. "
"9651520","9656500"," But inversion has beaten from around negative 40 basis points over the past week."
"9656500","9659100"," It's made the term relative value participation."
"9660120","9664980"," So between CPI, which may have affected the auction set up and ahead of the two PM fed minutes"
"9664980","9665280"," release. "
"9665860","9670640"," The auction faces significant event risk that may also sideline some investors."
"9671500","9677720"," Looking to the later CFTC positioning data shows that speculators were net short six hundred and"
"9677720","9683100"," twenty one thousand 10 year note contracts and net short one hundred and eighty six thousand ultra"
"9683100","9684420"," 10 year note contracts."
"9684980","9689280"," Also looking to the primary dealers position in the seven to 11 year sector. "
"9689840","9694280"," It was net long a four spot four billion dollars in the week ending March 29th."
"9694680","9696500"," That is the biggest thing since September."
"9696960","9701600"," And that is against the one spot six billion dollar average net short over the past year. "
"9702140","9705760"," So again a four spot four billion dollars net long in the week last week."
"9706120","9709040"," A one spot six billion net short is the average over the year."
"9736460","9739260"," So in a semaphore event white house is brain art. "

"9905490","9909230"," I was like what are you eating for lunch and she said she's it's. "
"9910190","9912790"," And I said how about a banana or an apple."
"9913790","9918710"," And I make you a sandwich top of the hour again the US is selling thirty two billion dollars in"
"9918710","9919650"," 10 year notes."
"9920470","9921530"," That sounds good. "
"9921710","9925530"," That would be prior high yield of three spot nine eight five percent."
"9925750","9929930"," This is seeing more comments from white house economic advisor brain art says thanks for showing up"
"9929930","9930630"," their balance sheets."

"10020090","10022030"," Do we see any liquidity above."
"10027670","10031730"," White house economic advisor brain art at the deposit outflows have stabilized. "
"10044260","10048700"," And I will say this dude."
"10058380","10060180"," You like normally I'd say."
"10061540","10066600"," I mean long calls here, but man, I'm I want to take that put side so fucking bad. "
"10066600","10075850"," I want to take it so bad because there's nobody on the trade trading thirty four cents right now."
"10079460","10082080"," Like the the trader senses inside of me."
"10083720","10086300"," The trader the trader inside of me is like. "
"10087700","10093960"," Take that put trade into the actual rate decision or minutes discussion."
"10094580","10095440"," It really is."
"10102610","10106330"," Yeah, you notice that I have to I have to switch back to. "
"10107530","10111430"," So who said that Chris is like I love the language today."
"10111550","10112470"," Keep your daughter around."

"10137710","10139230"," Oh, is it hello fellow kids."
"10146140","10150460"," Yeah, there's there's like it's probably two parts to this trade. "
"10150680","10151220"," There's probably."
"10151640","10154720"," Usually expecting the results for the U.S. 10 year note auction."
"10155080","10156980"," I will be leading with the coverage here. "
"10157440","10160900"," What's nice to me to get the treasury preset when issued at the top of the hour."
"10161820","10164640"," There's like some kind of a put trade in here."
"10164640","10167820"," I don't know time at least time wise. "
"10170230","10173150"," I like the I've got issues here."
"10173230","10176370"," My issues here today are two fold one."
"10176370","10181090"," The options market is kind of range bound right. "
"10183070","10190050"," My first issue that the market is kind of range bound right now."

"10195000","10197140"," Where's two o'clock right here. "
"10201220","10203740"," So here's the two o'clock hour right here, right?"
"10204060","10204720"," There's like this."
"10207050","10210530"," My idea here is that there'd be a failure to print."
"10213340","10215000"," Four, three, five percent. "
"10215240","10216500"," Three treasury winning street on the right."
"10216500","10218040"," We've let back this down here."
"10218700","10220820"," I just don't know when to buy them. "
"10220920","10222020"," I don't know if it's here."
"10222380","10224940"," I don't know if it's or if it's here."
"10227300","10236150"," I don't know where it is. "
"10236150","10242750"," What I want to, because what I'm trying to do here is I'm trying to think through the event ball"
"10242750","10249350"," coming off that trade, right, volatility comes off the trade, we squeeze higher, but if we..."
"10249350","10250310"," No, we can advise the brain answers."
"10250650","10253670"," We are seeing inflation coming down, but we do still have more work to do."
"10255730","10256510"," No you're not. "
"10257010","10258490"," You're not seeing inflation coming down."
"10259550","10260110"," You're not."
"10260310","10261390"," You're going to see a spike in inflation. "
"10262630","10263170"," We already know that."
"10267310","10275410"," I like the idea of the ball coming off the event in the two o'clock, so staying in this"
"10275410","10277070"," trade, but where is the role?"
"10277390","10285790"," I think there's a role today is my point, at some point, that between, at 2 p.m. or 205 "
"10285790","10290590","-215-15, I think there is a trade lower."
"10294840","10299220"," So, I think it's there, you have stone calls. "
"10309720","10314020"," I think the trade lower is there, and it's all just based on the options market."
"10318590","10324670"," If you've got some news, you don't have to get some news inside of that release, it was a ramp"
"10324670","10325950"," call buying, but..."
"10333870","10337170"," So they're going to respond some."
"10397570","10402990"," It's noting the Treasury 10-year yield advances to 3-spot, 4-5% after the auction sales. "

"10443650","10443970"," Friday."
"10444170","10445010"," Opics is not horrible."
"10445230","10445630"," They could run. "
"10446410","10446650"," Yeah."
"10446650","10453630"," Weeky's been talking about the XLF trade now for, oh what now, 3 weeks, 4 weeks."
"10453970","10462090"," We've traded underlying tickers in there over the past month, and our"
"10462090","10471910"," supposition was on XLF earnings on bank earnings, was that if you sell into bank earnings, that"
"10471910","10481670"," the 7-9 sessions, so if you're selling into bank earnings, 7-9 sessions, before bank"
"10481670","10484750"," earnings, you would expect it to be bought. "
"10484930","10487950"," That's where I know how to say the US economy is remarkably resilient."

"10503290","10512690"," Oh, you're still in the calls right on, yeah, so I think our conversation was if you sell into,"
"10512750","10517050"," this doesn't apply for every earnings, bank earnings specifically."
"10517630","10519670"," If they're bought into earnings, we tend to sell them."
"10520570","10525250"," If we sell into bank earnings, we tend to buy into the last 7-9 sessions. "
"10527570","10530130"," The real move though likely won't come until after."
"10530130","10540070"," The other issue with bank earnings is sometimes when they hit, they'll sell"
"10540070","10540930"," off by open."
"10543450","10547250"," So you need your calls to be a month or two out, so if you get the real move higher"
"10547250","10550770"," afterwards, you're not getting wrecked either. "
"10555970","10560590"," What dates are you, what dates, tell me your calls aren't for like the week of earnings."
"10562770","10564650"," If they are, I'll warn you of this."
"10566450","10572730"," If your calls are, well, in this name, it doesn't guarantee, but there's two trades typically in"
"10572730","10576710"," earnings for this kind of a trade. "
"10577050","10583110"," You would trade the, let's say you take a trade into it, let's say you're like, okay, well, we're"
"10583110","10589350"," selling banks and earnings, and then you're like, okay, I'm going to buy the dip for the ramp into"
"10589350","10593010"," earnings for like those 7-9 sessions, two weeks before earnings, right?"
"10593710","10599370"," So you take that trade, oh, yeah, baby, squeeze it."
"10600090","10601390"," So you take that trade, right?"
"10601990","10608070"," You close that trade, heading into earnings, their actual earning days, take the money and run."
"10608970","10614610"," If they're dated for like that week or the week after, you just take the money and run. "
"10617470","10621530"," And what, a bunch of reasons, right, you're going to lose, you're going to lose the IV."
"10622350","10624730"," You're going to lose the event, all that kind of stuff."
"10624970","10633270"," The other reason would be that oftentimes if they do squeeze up, if you're not long underlying with"
"10633270","10638190"," those gains will be taken, the next day will open on the low and then work our way higher into"
"10638190","10638970"," the next expiry. "
"10638970","10647490"," So there's like a second trade where you can enter bank earnings thereafter or you do the spreads"
"10647490","10652550"," or you time them farther out like a month, two months away and then you have to worry about any"
"10652550","10656090"," of that nonsense that takes place the day of earnings."
"10656830","10662490"," So you either have to structure it into two trades or you have to, if I own the underlying on"
"10662490","10670530"," a bank stock, the actual physical, I would be looking for like I take the money and run that early"
"10670530","10673270"," morning or that night before whenever they report."
"10674830","10678350"," And then it would be a second trade to go higher or lower. "
"10680110","10683090"," Squeezing higher now if your long calls, congratulations."
"10684930","10687490"," 412 C is now printing 35 cents."
"10694620","10696000"," Does it make sense to you guys?"
"10696720","10697620"," That would be like the standard. "
"10701270","10705930"," And I mean buying earnings like months before, like a month, two months before."
"10708230","10711890"," These trades already started a while ago."
"10714370","10720930"," Trade in 4.11.06. 4.11.09. As a matter of fact, Winky and I are both in I "
"10720930","10724130",".W. Hey, by the way, Winky, my calls are not that far away. "
"10724310","10730890"," I think we're the same price on our calls on I.W.M. And that trade."
"10731210","10731430"," All right."
"10731570","10736430"," So we're both in I.W.M. calls and they're far dated. "
"10739890","10745330"," And they're in anticipation of small cappers economic advantage as I am."
"10745430","10747410"," That's the that's the trick about the budget."
"10760270","10761190"," There you go. "
"10761350","10762390"," 4.11.02, baby."
"10762670","10763930"," Just keep on pumping, baby."
"10764410","10766110"," Keep on squeezing. "
"10769540","10770100"," Yeah."
"10770220","10777140"," I'm a little higher than you."
"10781620","10784320"," I'm still a minor still a bit more out of money than yours. "
"10785780","10788620"," I'm not looking to hold them up to get there either."
"10789160","10790640"," I'm just going to capture all."
"10790780","10793660"," I'm looking to capture all that premium heading into small capper earnings. "
"10794700","10798240"," I'm trying to capture the event or the earnings ball and all that kind of shit."
"10804460","10807020"," Yeah, I've got the six thirties too."
"10813190","10814670"," Keep on squeezing right now. "
"10814710","10819470"," Give me that 4.11.17. Keep on pumping."
"10820890","10823410"," Keep on pumping away."
"10827170","10828850"," Keep on pumping. "
"10829370","10830450"," Pump on."
"10830830","10833490"," Get that event ball off the market."
"10835690","10837930"," You know what they're going to say and I do too. "
"10839170","10840970"," Our only problem today."
"10842930","10848630"," Our only real problem today is that the options market."
"10848630","10852690"," We need the bulls to buy a bunch of crap that's out of the money. "
"10853310","10857690"," We need the bulls to be buying 4.15 and 4.20 for us to trade up there."
"10858570","10861530"," We need these bulls to believe we're going to the moon."
"10862410","10870230"," We need range expansion in the options market or else we're going to get turned around on the high,"
"10870590","10870810"," baby. "
"10871530","10872990"," That's what's going to happen."
"10875430","10882790"," Now trading 43 cents on 4.12.C. You can always take the money and run whenever you like."
"10888810","10890510"," Look at the pump, baby. "
"10890770","10894210"," It's 4.11.39. Everybody's telegraphed to you."
"10894690","10895230"," Nick Timrose."
"10896710","10898290"," Another fair point. "
"10898450","10900710"," We talked about Nick Timrose last week."
"10902050","10905430"," Told you that the Fed is telegraphing to you."
"10905430","10906910"," What it's doing. "
"10907390","10909310"," Nick Timrose has been firing off."
"10909970","10911890"," I know I haven't livestreamed the past few sessions."
"10912890","10919350"," But when I haven't been livestreaming, Timrose coming out at key moments in this market and"
"10919350","10921210"," straight point blank telling you. "
"10921450","10923250"," Point blank telling you."
"10923830","10926570"," Expect a discussion about a pause the minutes."
"10927750","10934230"," Expect the Fed to be more tactful in how it applies rate increases. "
"10934230","10936170"," He didn't say, oh, we're going to cut rates."
"10936770","10942750"," He said, look for some pause talk and look for some more strategic raises in the future."
"10943690","10946110"," Not just bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"10954500","10955540"," June 30th."
"10956460","10966380"," Trading 4.11.35. I didn't want to get involved in"
"10966380","10969820"," the, so just look at this right here."
"10970320","10971760"," Think of this like IWM. "
"10972600","10974860"," This chart right here is just like IWM."
"10977000","10981200"," Lot of work, lot of work, lot of danger, lot of work, lot of consolidation, up down, up down."
"10982040","10984700"," This last little part right here should be a nice fat squeeze. "
"10985020","10986820"," I want that part of the trade at IWM."
"10987560","10992720"," If you open up an IWM daily chart, look at a daily chart and I don't even look just like"
"10992720","10992960"," this."
"10994020","10994760"," Just like this. "
"10995840","10999300"," And this is pretty much where we are with IWM right there."
"11000320","11004680"," So I don't want to get involved in all this and get torn up and repriced and all this other"
"11004680","11004960"," nonsense."
"11005040","11007860"," I want to capture this part of the move right here. "
"11014590","11029210"," 4.12 seat now trading $0.47 in the"
"11029210","11030030"," money, baby."
"11032270","11033630"," I like that."
"11033870","11034830"," I like that Omar. "
"11038870","11046590"," 4.11.44, 4.11.33. Trading $0.48. I'm going to take some money off up here soon."
"11048690","11051530"," Start looking to take some money off above here."
"11058550","11060810"," I'm reading Winky what you're posting right now, brother. "
"11063430","11077640"," Trading $0.46. Should"
"11077640","11079160"," I sell for a medium loss?"
"11080300","11086080"," You could have added to your position down here to then make your position more profitable."
"11087520","11088720"," I don't know what you're in for."
"11092750","11096390"," So when options get repriced, there's one problem. "
"11096790","11099310"," So I do want you to let's talk about that right real quick."
"11103440","11105240"," Sometimes we talk about this, but not all the time."
"11105420","11110280"," So let's say you bought an option a zero date. "
"11116160","11117000"," Let's see about an option."
"11117000","11120380"," Let's see about a 4.12 seat right here."
"11121760","11122840"," And they cost a dollar. "
"11124380","11133250"," Later in the day we get here, you're likely not going to see the base of these, a dollar, right?"
"11133370","11136430"," They'd be like $0.70. Well, it'd be like $0.70 over here."
"11136430","11140950"," It'd probably be $0.60 over here, right?"
"11141090","11141590"," Like a base case."
"11143530","11150430"," $0.50, $0.40, $0.30, $0.20, $0.10, right?"
"11150990","11152030"," It'd be like their base case. "
"11154910","11162370"," So if you, let's say you're trapped over here and your thesis still holds up and it starts to come"
"11162370","11169670"," back, you can then take that dollar that you paid and pay like $0.60 or $0.50 and DCA."
"11170430","11172510"," So you actually become a winning trader on this trade."
"11172730","11173150"," Does that make sense?"
"11174210","11181750"," You will get paid if price, if you bought a dollar here as an example, just as an example, you"
"11181750","11184910"," would come back and pay it if we went much, much higher, of course. "
"11186810","11189690"," But that's part of 106 counter parties."
"11189930","11194110"," Take $2.304 trillion at the Fed reverse repo operation."
"11194110","11199450"," Scaling into a trade that's your correct directionally, but not in timing. "
"11201190","11203330"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"11203730","11206630"," At this point, your option is not DCA."
"11208270","11211110"," You should have DCA'd somewhere down in here at minimum. "
"11211730","11213730"," This is a pretty safe trade right here."
"11213810","11215070"," This part of the trade is pretty safe."
"11216030","11218050"," So you could have DCA'd wherever you're caught in over here. "
"11218270","11223110"," You should have added to your position here and then get directly out of your trade, which is"
"11223110","11224290"," what's happening right now."
"11224990","11228770"," So what's happening right now is anyone that's caught here is selling."
"11230110","11234890"," That's why you're seeing selling pressure here is because you have trapped longs and they just want"
"11234890","11235450"," to get out. "
"11237170","11240850"," They just want to be like, I want to reposition myself for a better trade higher."
"11241550","11243110"," Not the best way to make money."
"11243690","11245170"," Typically you'd DCA in here. "
"11245770","11248330"," You'd be up on the trade making money."
"11248330","11255370"," And then you'd be cutting it here and then looking for a repositioning."
"11255690","11260450"," So that's what you'll likely see in here is repositioning by longs that are trapped. "
"11260910","11263070"," And you'll see the same thing back over here too will happen again."
"11264910","11266590"," You get some longs that are trapped in here."
"11266770","11270930"," You got some probably have some kind of a long trapped in here as well. "
"11285780","11289380"," Now what am I buying puts right around here?"
"11289960","11298820"," I want to see that squeeze up that ball come off and then I want to grab some puts."
"11299620","11304660"," Unless something material is said that we don't know."
"11317450","11318170"," Thanks, Winky. "
"11329170","11330930"," Yeah, Winky, you want to comment on that?"
"11330930","11331890"," The Azure numbers."
"11335650","11340890"," So the holy croissant is saying still amaze about absurd numbers when I don't know a single tech"
"11340890","11342230"," company in my space using Azure."
"11352520","11356040"," Don't forget we also have the treasury budget coming out at 2 p.m. as well. "
"11358640","11362700"," Thursday we have PPI and core C core PPI."
"11363640","11365120"," PPI year over year."
"11366760","11368760"," Core PPI year over year. "
"11369020","11371380"," Initial claims and continuing claims."
"11372220","11373940"," A ton of all heading into tomorrow."
"11375220","11378420"," And then Friday we have retail sales. "
"11378660","11381200"," Retail sales meant minus autos import price index."
"11382400","11383400"," Plus minus fuels."
"11384260","11388660"," Now if that wall are speaking at 845 in the morning and we get industrial production 915. "
"11389100","11391400"," Faster utilization 915."
"11392180","11394780"," My consumer sentiment at 10 and business inventory is 10."
"11406230","11409150"," Yeah, we did a good job of explaining this to me as well. "
"11409570","11412890"," Last week he tried to explain this on the phone to me while they were giving it away."
"11432230","11432850"," VV avatar."
"11433290","11434050"," How are you doing out there?"
"11438190","11439130"," Nice right on Omar. "
"11445000","11446700"," If you're just tuning in right now."
"11447780","11450240"," I don't like the well there's a few things you need to know."
"11451500","11455460"," I don't like the idea of the options market not being priced. "
"11457580","11458120"," Higher."
"11458740","11459760"," Call expansion."
"11462880","11466220"," Today I don't like the idea that everybody's loaded to the tips and calls. "
"11470450","11472250"," I see the liquidity up above."
"11472770","11473550"," So if you look on."
"11477990","11483150"," I see this liquidity here and this liquidity here and this is the big big band of liquidity above"
"11483150","11483690"," right here. "
"11487990","11489530"," No one's on the put side."
"11489670","11492130"," We have some volatility coming into the market tomorrow morning."
"11497410","11503510"," So my concern right now would be not having the fuel to rocket higher into. "
"11505810","11507590"," Or after the event much."
"11507910","11513270"," So get the event ball come off and maybe there's a reversal to the downside of tomorrow."
"11514770","11518570"," So I'm looking for the event ball trade. "
"11518970","11523470"," But then I'm also a more interest rather than being I'm not as interested personally."
"11523710","11525210"," Normally I'm interested in."
"11525950","11528170"," Normally I'd say as long as news is good. "
"11528930","11531210"," I'd expect a rejection."
"11539530","11542710"," A rejection off of the event ball just before."
"11543990","11546590"," And then it's some kind of a pump higher into the bell. "
"11547570","11549770"," Normally this is what I'm normally expecting today."
"11549770","11552110"," But for today the way the options market is."
"11554230","11555450"," Not so sure. "
"11556590","11559670"," That we have the fuel that we need to keep going higher."
"11559870","11560790"," I'm not positive on that."
"11560850","11563370"," I don't like the fact that everybody's loaded the tips on put calls here. "
"11563530","11564490"," Normally when that happens."
"11565730","11567210"," We either get some unexpected news."
"11568770","11569670"," We blast down. "
"11571410","11575190"," Or we just get a failure just just a failure to buy the calls that we need."
"11575190","11576030"," So."
"11577490","11579950"," I'm actually looking for a put trade today. "
"11582210","11584090"," I'm looking for it but not now."
"11584330","11586550"," I'm looking for it once the event ball rolls up."
"11586750","11588810"," So I'm hoping for like the initial push higher. "
"11589630","11592030"," And then it takes some kind of a put position up here."
"11593470","11595430"," Somewhere up in here for tomorrow."
"11610390","11612390"," Yeah I see that for 15 in the weekly. "
"11617700","11622040"," Yeah Barry for today the weekly or the daily move for today is for 12."
"11625360","11629860"," So I'm like yeah do we get like the pump off the off the event ball today."
"11630060","11632660"," And then we sell down and then we squeeze up into Friday. "
"11665470","11668550"," This is like this is like the classic bear set up right here."
"11669470","11672550"," I'm going to be careful of some weakness into the event."
"11672810","11674390"," There's the one minute chart right here. "
"11674390","11677350"," This chart is set up classically to roll."
"11678710","11683390"," So you'll get some some volatility into the event and then the squeeze up higher."
"11683990","11686250"," If you can't handle this role if it happens. "
"11687150","11688850"," And just be aware that it is setting up."
"11692710","11694510"," There's just some commentary from the black group."
"11694750","11700150"," So you think he says I see stickier inflation not going below 4% soon. "
"11714730","11716190"," Yeah we're getting close now right."
"11716450","11717410"," We're almost half an hour."
"11718550","11722150"," To be conscious of any kind of a place to buy a dip is likely down here. "
"11722790","11725830"," I want you to realize also that if we do get any bad news."
"11726630","11729390"," Into I might be very keenly aware here."
"11729930","11733070"," We're going to go through the VIX really quick but I want to be very keenly aware here. "
"11733910","11735870"," Sometimes we squeeze right up into it."
"11737170","11745880"," Sometimes we get selling pressure into the event with a dip to buy to go up higher here."
"11746160","11753540"," And if we get any kind of bad news in this event we start trading underneath this zone right here. "
"11754380","11757460"," We are going to be looking for some big lows."
"11758580","11763380"," So be conscious of that be conscious of this previous loan this implied move down below."
"11764640","11765900"," For the move lower. "
"11766860","11772820"," You're going to need a bunch of puts be bought to carry this low even farther down below this"
"11772820","11773540"," implied move."
"11773820","11778540"," So you have a lot of mechanics working in the background here to the up and down side that need"
"11778540","11779480"," to be respected."
"11783190","11785670"," We have the previous low on the day down here. "
"11787960","11793000"," If the news is not bad I would expect any weakness to be followed by a dip by to go"
"11793000","11793300"," higher."
"11794100","11796200"," You see your implied moves on the daily here."
"11796200","11798100"," Here and here. "
"11798860","11801220"," The options market is weighted to the call side."
"11802200","11804320"," We do are seeing some liquidity above."
"11804440","11808700"," You can see it forming above my head over here to the top here right there. "
"11808800","11809320"," You can see it."
"11818440","11820700"," Yeah I like the idea of the Volcrush trade up higher."
"11822060","11824400"," Certainly the squeeze higher is what I'm interested in. "
"11825700","11829760"," But then I'm looking for I think the bears are going to step in and try to sell whatever comes"
"11829760","11830780"," out of this."
"11830780","11834740"," I think they're up there waiting to sell above."
"11856390","11857910"," If you want to end of day today. "
"11858730","11859850"," We'll take a look at."
"11861250","11862850"," How about this at the end of day today."
"11862850","11866510"," We'll take a look at banking stocks. "
"11867730","11871770"," We'll look at some of the larger components of the banking sector."
"11872650","11875970"," And we'll take a look at some of the beaten down that are coming back."
"11876730","11878370"," Regional bank tickers if you like. "
"11878370","11879630"," You call them out to me."
"11879770","11882430"," We'll look at them individually."
"11883210","11887450"," So you guys can be prepared for that cut that those ER is coming up. "
"11888030","11889130"," You guys want to do that in a day."

"11903610","11904870"," Vicks bears currently. "
"11906670","11910430"," Although it is at the same place that it gets bought or not not same place."
"11910430","11911550"," It's got a little bit more to go down."
"11917680","11919600"," That's the thing about Vicks right now too. "
"11920600","11922560"," Is Vic Vicks has more."
"11922740","11928560"," So Vicks can go down to like $18.25. But really what are we expecting for it to go to."
"11929780","11934020"," The next level below I believe is 1706. "
"11935500","11939580"," So if you got that you got that rocket ship higher likely going to sell it."
"11941550","11944970"," I'd be tempered in your expectations for the move higher today."
"11959970","11963110"," I would say that any squeeze higher is likely going to get sold. "
"11988570","11989090"," Schwab."
"11992710","11995010"," No, it's the it's the it's the flat trade."

"12376550","12379010"," I got some cool for you guys to watch or read. "
"12379010","12381130"," Think tighter I got some cool for you guys."
"12381690","12383830"," Any of you that are interested in."
"12387150","12389390"," If any guys truly interested. "
"12394310","12396570"," In Taiwan the US."
"12406150","12407890"," I'll post something for you here."
"12409290","12410730"," You want to look up the. "
"12412770","12413950"," Center for."
"12415410","12417410"," Strategic and international studies."
"12421010","12423430"," And you specifically want to look up. "
"12423790","12426630"," A white paper that they did."
"12427650","12430510"," Called the first battle of the next war."
"12431870","12435090"," We're gaining a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. "
"12439900","12441480"," I'm going to post you a link to."
"12444750","12447550"," There's an hour and a half program on that on YouTube."
"12447550","12452830"," And then what I'll do is I will. "
"12457230","12459170"," I'll send you the white paper next."
"12463630","12465450"," And then we'll talk about it."
"12474940","12479340"," Here is a link to the web page to download the PDF I believe. "
"12480140","12481180"," The whole made of that."
"12481320","12483920"," But I think you can get here's I think is the link to the website."
"12486500","12489040"," The last one is to their actual main website. "
"12489040","12491460"," The cool part about this is that it's."
"12493640","12494540"," It's a."
"12495620","12497920"," Not unclassified war gaming."
"12502550","12505790"," Unclassified war gaming for Taiwan and US. "
"12507190","12509210"," Now I will tell you this."
"12509710","12511830"," This war gaming they did."
"12515030","12517150"," Or war gaming as it's done. "
"12517790","12521430"," I'm not impressed with what they're saying about war gaming."
"12523500","12525340"," Because they're like, Oh, the simulations we ran."
"12527460","12531260"," The US won most of the war games, but not without. "
"12534220","12537000"," Major destruction to both."
"12538860","12543760"," China, Taiwan and the US specifically the US's projection of power."
"12544500","12547900"," That actually is where you where McCrone comes into the to the conversation. "
"12548740","12550280"," And you hear McCrone talking right now."
"12550280","12555720"," He's trying to position himself for more strength in NATO."
"12556960","12559480"," And in in the in the European Union. "
"12561000","12566200"," So this has so so if you hear McCrone talking right now has to do with if there was war."
"12566700","12568800"," With Taiwan China in the United States."
"12569520","12572780"," The US would not be able to project its influence like it like it normally does. "
"12573500","12574480"," Around the world."
"12574480","12579140"," And so McCrone's trying to position position himself believe it or not as the as that person."
"12580740","12586980"," So this should give you some idea of why you hear McCrone talking the way that he does. "
"12588280","12589920"," And the reasons for it."
"12590560","12595720"," The implications of why he's trying to put us out into the ring with this stuff."
"12598710","12604970"," Now what I do want to warn you against with any kind of war gaming war planning that you read"
"12604970","12606110"," out there. "
"12607750","12611210"," I was in the United States military and sat in those."
"12613470","12617470"," War war gaming planning sessions on a very high level."
"12617870","12618750"," I'll tell you this. "
"12620490","12623410"," They honestly do not give a great."
"12627230","12628470"," They're good to know."
"12629050","12634230"," It's never really what really happens and what they never what they fail to tell you. "
"12635310","12636930"," Of course on."
"12638990","12640570"," That I word this on."
"12642730","12644090"," Unclassified war gaming. "
"12644630","12650770"," They don't show you some of the war gaming that takes place where where and how we can and do"
"12650770","12651150"," lose."
"12653870","12655530"," Although they do look at those."
"12656830","12658510"," In classified war gaming. "
"12659090","12661250"," Of course they're not going to tell you how that happens right."
"12662490","12664350"," Or confirm what your beliefs are."
"12666050","12667650"," So you can really only put. "
"12668350","12671550"," You can really only put like a great not quite a grain of salt."
"12672010","12675530"," It's a good way to discuss and argue to cite."
"12677710","12680330"," In your arguments with other people out there. "
"12680690","12683450"," But the truth is for your own sanity."
"12684830","12688450"," They're hard to really believe that that is how war goes."
"12699060","12702280"," But if you want a baseline they're pretty good people too. "
"12703000","12704360"," They're pretty good think tank."
"12705440","12708720"," I should say for what you can publicly see in the outside."
"12724480","12727640"," Yeah the fed thinks they're going to get back two percent they are dreamers. "
"12727880","12728380"," Yeah I agree."
"12730180","12731960"," We're not looking like that are we Jimmy."
"12734620","12736160"," We're not looking like that at all man. "
"12737860","12739300"," I think that deal was broken."
"12753450","12755690"," Kind of a dangerous situation been following for years."
"12755950","12757570"," I have masters in Middle Eastern studies. "
"12758630","12759890"," I don't know if I."
"12760590","12761770"," I've got my own."
"12762070","12763930"," I mean I've got thoughts I shouldn't talk about but."
"12765030","12767670"," I do agree with a lot of what they're saying in that report. "
"12769910","12772510"," The things that I agree about in that report that they wrote."
"12772630","12774190"," It's a nice big fat long report too."
"12776590","12778390"," See they can open that up somewhere. "
"12779150","12780930"," See if that is the actual download."
"12782350","12783230"," Yeah that is."
"12783590","12785530"," So the download is the download for the report. "
"12787910","12789290"," It's a read."
"12789530","12790170"," It's a long read."
"12791790","12793150"," It's 165 pages. "
"12795930","12798110"," But I agree with a lot of the assessment in the report."
"12798570","12801570"," If we do go to war with China it has to be fast."
"12803910","12806010"," They take some liberties in this report. "
"12806010","12807550"," They took some liberties saying we'd lose."
"12807950","12810210"," They like automatically assume we'd lose two carriers."
"12811090","12813510"," They automatically assumed that we wouldn't have any help. "
"12814990","12816570"," In Southeast Asia."
"12816850","12818070"," Far East Asia."
"12818550","12819970"," From other countries. "
"12820930","12823650"," So they already they've already kind of like hand tied the US."
"12824330","12826610"," But they don't talk about a lot of the other dangers."
"12827710","12832350"," One of the major ones I see is fast boat attacks stuff like that. "
"12834610","12836430"," I'm concerned with with."
"12837790","12840090"," I wouldn't call it guerrilla type warfare."
"12840550","12843370"," But just you see Iran does a good job of that stuff. "
"12845050","12849170"," You've seen some of our destroyers attacked in conventional ways."
"12849650","12851790"," I think in one of the war games of Norway."
"12852430","12859150"," I think it was one of the Scandinavian countries was able to circumvent a lot of our our Navy. "
"12859150","12860550"," Do you know how large we are."
"12861730","12865430"," But it does bring up the it does bring up the answer to that question."
"12865910","12868590"," Of how do you combat that and it's it's being swift. "
"12869410","12870950"," In our actions with China."
"12871750","12873870"," So I agree with that aspect of that report."
"12874610","12876150"," That we have to be. "
"12879910","12882330"," As aggressive as we were in World War two."
"12883590","12886210"," Or aggression like we haven't seen since World War two."
"12886210","12888390"," But the one thing that that report didn't address. "
"12889390","12890790"," Was the nuclear threat."
"12891430","12893850"," If we do take that course of action with China."
"12897420","12899500"," And does that raise the nuclear threat. "
"12901680","12903260"," This is how swift will have to be."
"12905560","12906880"," So there's some danger there."
"12919830","12925770"," Yeah, the fear with the fear with our so I ran does a good job of working with what they"
"12925770","12926070"," have. "
"12929010","12931750"," They do a fairly good job of that working with what they have."
"12932770","12937470"," That's the one fear that I would have with with China."
"12937690","12939490"," But the way that you retaliate against that is. "
"12940270","12941230"," Use overwhelming force."
"12942790","12943630"," Like vicious."
"12945470","12949490"," And you don't wait for when we wave when we wave the flag and call a truce. "
"12953610","12957470"," My other that report does a pretty good job it has a lot of talks a lot about."
"12960470","12960950"," Alming."
"12962190","12966830"," Taiwan with a land to land missiles that can reach Shanghai and places like that. "
"12982830","12983910"," I think that happens."
"12984130","12986870"," I was in the I was in a call with Chas one day."
"12989610","12992870"," And I had said to Chas I said if that war starts. "
"12994630","12998110"," You'll more than likely not only see that happen what you're talking about."
"12999610","13005830"," But you'd even see the United States turn into an immediately into intranet or shut down with"
"13005830","13009570"," Internet thereafter with only approved new content on the Internet."
"13010430","13014490"," If that war starts I would expect the Internet to be shut off in the United States as well. "
"13015810","13016770"," At least briefly."
"13017350","13023430"," And then maybe present like it'd be like a intranet where anything that's already there you can"
"13023430","13023790"," consume."
"13024410","13027710"," And then they would only be approved content from that point forward. "
"13040470","13045430"," Yeah, I expect it to be if that were if that were so I have some expectations."
"13048030","13054250"," If that war starts it's going to be ruthless the US will be ruthless in there."
"13055310","13057410"," It's not going to be like what you think it's going to be. "
"13057490","13059030"," It's not going to be like a build up in the US."
"13059030","13060350"," It's not where you see it."
"13060810","13068050"," It's not it's going to be like cut your legs off as swift and as fast as possible. "
"13070530","13073370"," And likely all of those nations will be involved in that too."
"13074030","13079190"," You're going to then also assume that Israel does some shit pulls some shit."
"13088290","13088990"," Hey, thanks. "
"13089130","13090450"," I'll open that right now brother."
"13093360","13094800"," I'm in a book market right now, man."
"13095300","13096300"," But all I'm going to read it. "
"13096620","13097480"," I read it tonight."
"13100700","13101980"," Thanks for posting that."
"13104500","13107800"," There's a bunch of stuff that's not talked about if that so for that swift. "
"13108900","13111440"," I was telling Chaz I said we got a war with China."
"13112940","13115820"," You better hope that you better pray the of a Plex server at home."
"13116180","13118240"," I'd be like download some books and some audio books. "
"13118480","13125540"," It's like because the US is first thing they're going to do is cut off our access from these"
"13125540","13129400"," nations to our own country, the infrastructure, our infrastructure."
"13130580","13134880"," The first thing, a real war, a real true war with Russia with China."
"13135560","13137260"," Immediately you cut off the internet. "
"13143570","13144710"," To around the world."
"13151510","13152510"," Yeah, I'm not a."
"13154970","13156550"," No, I'm not afraid of the downloading."
"13156550","13158330"," I'm afraid of the. "
"13159590","13161610"," I'm afraid of the electrical infrastructure."
"13161730","13164510"," I'm afraid of code being inserted into."
"13168090","13169670"," Power plant stuff like that. "
"13171530","13175790"," I'm afraid of the threat to our financial system banking system."
"13177230","13178710"," Malicious code that kind of stuff."
"13179650","13181830"," And then my last fair would be. "
"13184130","13185790"," The use of social media."
"13187930","13188690"," During the war."
"13190690","13191990"," To bed in public opinion. "
"13199150","13199970"," I don't know."
"13200110","13201130"," I don't know if I'm worried about the radiation."
"13204720","13206240"," Yeah, that's what I thought too, Winky. "
"13209540","13211320"," I thought we just cut it in San Francisco."
"13211520","13213900"," Can we just do that a minute away from the top of the hour?"
"13214100","13216080"," How would you get the release of the US federal budget balance?"
"13227100","13227460"," And then you'd have like an Internet."
"13227460","13231820"," I thought we thought we just cut them at there's an AT&T building in San Francisco, right?"
"13231980","13233220"," Where all that stuff comes in or out. "
"13233800","13235740"," I thought we just cut it right there and be done with it."
"13235900","13236940"," And then you'd have like an Internet."
"13238900","13241500"," For all intensive purposes, like a US Internet. "
"13244470","13252730"," and then the only last part that I would say to that point would be if there's information leaking"
"13252730","13256950"," out of the United States from that point forward right so if I was on the internet here in the"
"13256950","13264150"," US and I was a foreign national let's say in the United States how do I get that information out"
"13264150","13271330"," that's in our internet you wouldn't want like Twitter news getting any kind of like you wouldn't"
"13271330","13279170"," want like somebody at home going yeah my husband or my wife is this and she knows this blabbing I"
"13279170","13284590"," think in a full-scale war like that like this is not a rack right we're not really worried about"
"13284590","13291730"," what a rack does you know we're with a rack but with China and Russia specifically you probably"
"13291730","13299990"," want to limit new content is that what it is the ATT building isn't it"
"13299990","13310370"," well the cable building is that they a Manchester to California and Mendocino County well that's"
"13310370","13314550"," what I was thinking about was the satellite internet winky so I'm like yeah with the sad that's"
"13314550","13323150"," that's my thought is wink is that if we had our internet here you would still have leakage this"
"13323150","13328210"," isn't permanent people think you can't do that when we did it during COVID right you guys are or"
"13328210","13334130"," you guys know this how fast do we shut down the country when we wanted to how fast was it"
"13334130","13339910"," was pretty fucking fast right it's pretty fast so to say like yeah we can't shut down the internet"
"13339910","13346090"," in the United States I'll fucking tell you what there's a button there is definitely a button"
"13350570","13354290"," there's definitely a button to shut it off and then if they turn it back on they could say yeah"
"13354290","13360930"," it's all just it's all content like anything it's already been said is good to go and we're going"
"13360930","13368010"," to limit who can post so they could go right to YouTube and say all these people are trusted we"
"13368010","13377270"," could say you already see these companies right CNBC CNN have a have a YouTube channels you see"
"13377270","13386210"," Twitter with verified channels you could see words be used or you could just be warned by the US"
"13386210","13392590"," government to say if you talk about this or talk about that you'll get cut off right and they could"
"13392590","13397090"," just blanket block you and you'd have to go through a process to be able to get back on the"
"13397090","13407090"," internet talk so you see it's no route"
"13407090","13420910"," or IP addresses in DNS it's that easy huh yeah I"
"13420910","13426230"," would assume that they know about it but I do think it's fast I do think it's fascinating and I"
"13426230","13432400"," think it'd be quick you're talking about a war that probably last I don't know a couple months"
"13432400","13447970"," maybe max one month two weeks a month yeah"
"13451910","13460190"," I like the idea of the intranet I like the idea of having like a US internet and then just"
"13460190","13484470"," rules like okay we shut it off here your rules until further notice oh don't"
"13484470","13489890"," forget we're gonna give you you what's it called UBI you'll get universal basic income for the next"
"13489890","13496030"," few weeks you'll see I would assume you'd see price controls probably see price controls wage"
"13496030","13504730"," controls you'd see anybody that doesn't have a job you possibly would see a FEMA camps be open"
"13504730","13512330"," dispersed cities that would be the only other aspect that I would think of so in our five minutes"
"13512330","13518050"," away from the top of the hour and the release of the FOMC meeting minutes for the March meeting I"
"13518050","13523030"," keep reminders to get the US federal budget balance has a forecast of minus 314 billion on the"
"13523030","13528830"," prior of minus 262 billion five minutes meeting with the until the minute that the top of the hour"
"13528830","13535890"," if you're watching us on YouTube you want to go down to the preferences you might want to refresh"
"13535890","13545810"," your screen you're watching liquidity leave the market currently you also want"
"13545810","13552190"," to refresh your browser possibly another thing that you could do is hit the settings cogwheel click"
"13552190","13561110"," settings on YouTube and speed up the broadcast by times two my voice will sound like a clown like I"
"13561110","13567910"," normally am on fin to it and then my voice will get normal again so you only have a few"
"13567910","13574210"," second delay if you're on twitch there's an option for you to make it real time only a second delay"
"13574210","13581850"," but otherwise twitch is the fastest way to follow I appreciate you all showing up today I think you"

"17282470","17288150"," bull bears need this price to get up here to get that new low in the market is the point"

"17307020","17312620"," here when i want it to happen uh right away the other issue here is that the options market is"
"17312620","17321920"," not priced in the options market is not priced in right now for more than trading this zone does"
"17321920","17326200"," that make sense if we had an applied move that was down below it four oh six something like that"

"17331840","17337960"," so probably the best that you'd expect into this bell would be some kind of selling into the bell"
"17337960","17346240"," and then maybe you get a squeeze down below to this four oh five and it is closed so what"
