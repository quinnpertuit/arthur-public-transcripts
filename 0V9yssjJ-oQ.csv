"274490","275890"," It's not easy being an investor."
"276970","277330"," Nothing."
"278410","279670"," It is so difficult. "
"280570","281650"," It is so hard."
"285030","286050"," And it's not easy."
"286870","288890"," Yeah, everybody here knows that too, Josh. "
"289030","293610"," I want you to know that we've been creating this small group of people that's been going on for a"
"293610","295590"," couple of years now and are close to a couple of years."
"295590","298890"," It's been going on long in that years and years in Wall Street, I believe or not."
"299930","302390"," I mean, I had people pick me up under the wing and stuff like that. "
"302450","302790"," It's not easy."
"303030","304310"," I need to pick you up under my wing either."
"304930","308450"," But to make it, you're talking like 10% of people make it. "
"309150","311330"," And you're showing what it takes to make it."
"311470","313050"," And it sucks to make it."
"314550","321610"," It sucks because there are a lot of times where you got a conviction or you got to switch fast. "
"321610","326470"," I was telling people here recently about how I broke a desk down in a chair."
"327130","329510"," Like I asked my family to leave the house."

"333870","334410"," down out back. "
"334930","337110"," Or something I was just so hard headed in."

"366550","366770"," I'm sorry."

"368330","370670"," You and a couple of the guys are in there just banging it out. "
"372010","372750"," It's not easy."
"372750","374370"," It's not easy to be an investor."
"374790","376530"," It's not easy to be a trader. "
"377930","378830"," I don't say to you guys."
"378850","380130"," You guys know what's as good as I do."
"381110","381910"," It's not easy. "
"383350","385570"," You guys see a pumpers on YouTube and shit like that."
"386930","388150"," They have to do a certain thing."
"388290","388590"," That's fine. "
"388750","389090"," I get it."
"390130","390730"," It's not easy."
"390930","391530"," I watched the guy. "
"391630","393570"," I'm not going to name names, but I watched the guy say, take the leap of faith."
"394170","394850"," Just buy this dip."
"395510","396510"," And I get it. "
"396670","397250"," I get that."
"397350","397930"," You create that."
"398890","399570"," I understand it. "
"399750","400430"," I understand what you're saying."
"400430","402670"," The thing that I got to tell you guys something."
"402790","404230"," I want to tell Josh something specifically. "
"404810","405610"," But it's no chest."
"405830","406390"," Stop running city."
"406750","411930"," I want to say something specifically to Josh because I get really scared, right?"

"416270","416670"," Dreamville."
"416770","417330"," Good to see you."
"417810","420610"," I got to tell you guys something like I get paranoid. "
"421310","423770"," So I got to do all this research and do the due diligence."
"424070","424810"," I talked to you guys."
"425550","426610"," I got to think of Twitter. "
"426990","427930"," Talk to smart guys, right?"
"427930","429310"," Talk to the Adam Mancini's."
"429430","431850"," Talk to the, you name, right?"
"432170","432470"," Vol Wiz."
"433090","434390"," Talk to all these guys, right?"
"434490","435110"," They shoot me down. "
"435270","436990"," They make me feel like I'm nothing right."
"437150","438190"," We'll follow fucking Spock."
"438190","439090"," You name it, right?"
"439590","440830"," Then I'm over here doing my thing. "
"441930","444030"," And I don't want to fuck you guys over."
"445330","447190"," Like I'm scared of shit."
"447450","449690"," I was telling Joe Donut earlier today. "
"450770","454310"," I'm under a ton of pressure because I'm relying upon you guys."
"454310","461090"," You guys relied upon me and, you know, if things go the wrong way, I have to adjust."
"461370","462130"," Let's say we went up today. "
"462470","463930"," Let's say we went the other fucking way, right?"
"464170","464850"," That was wrong."
"466510","467210"," I'd be fucked."
"467830","472070"," And so how do I shift from there from right to wrong to keep going up?"
"473350","475410"," How do I not lose all of you guys with me?"
"476730","480650"," How do you guys lose not lose faith in each other and stuff like that, right?"
"481290","483130"," So things could easily go wrong at any time. "
"483130","487850"," Like I've been wrong, you know, and how do you shift from being wrong to being right, right?"
"488070","490010"," Let's say you're wrong and you shift to go up."
"491290","492430"," But even then, right?"
"492790","495770"," We're all a team and we're a group of traders together."
"495950","497650"," We make wrong decisions and I've been wrong. "
"497770","500830"," You guys have heard me go wrong the wrong way many times."
"501230","507170"," So there's this point of there's a lot of stress in this and there's a lot of stress in just"
"507170","507950"," what you guys are doing."
"507950","508290"," Two, right?"
"508390","509590"," Money in the line, my money in the line. "
"511590","514830"," And how many times since 2020 have we been wrong, right?"
"515150","515590"," I'm a bull."
"516130","520809"," But how many times have we been at a bottom and we've caught that bottom and wrote it all the"
"520809","521130"," way up."
"521730","524350"," And then at that, you know, because we know what's going up. "
"524810","527750"," This is the one time that it didn't of every time in two years."
"528130","529750"," There's other times in the past, right?"
"530230","534730"," But right now at this moment, this is like the legends are made of, right?"
"535090","535670"," March 2020."
"535670","538950"," When the turn happened in March 2020, I had some friends. "
"539190","540630"," I was on Wall Street bets back in 2020."
"540630","541470"," We guys know this."
"541570","541730"," Okay. "
"542390","543710"," We rolled over in 2020."
"543710","544550"," I knew it was happening."
"545370","547610"," We made the turn in 2020. "
"548170","550570"," I had a lot of fucking friends like real friends like you guys, right?"
"551350","557250"," And when we made that turn, you know, guys are making like $20,000 bets."
"558010","559430"," Then they took $20,000 bets."
"559590","560650"," Turn them into $50,000 bets. "
"561430","562190"," $100,000 bets."
"562350","562610"," They all paid."
"563490","564150"," And people were rich. "
"564150","568610"," And we made that turn and some guys couldn't get over it."
"569430","572810"," You know, it just keeps fucking selling in the mind, right?"
"573150","574110"," Like it keeps going up."
"574710","578890"," And, you know, it got me really burned me out today. "
"578990","583150"," I was really stressed out after today because I don't want to be talking about this shit."
"583730","587930"," But, you know, it stresses me out because if I tell you the wrong thing, and then I have to"
"587930","594050"," worry in my mind that I do the right due diligence, did I miss something in my due diligence?"
"594870","596850"," Did I miss something in the research?"
"597110","599650"," Did I miss something in the layers of the builds up to this moment?"
"600070","603550"," I think that's SG literally telling me we're not breaking below 460."
"604850","605750"," Then we go to 450. "
"606530","608530"," Then we go to 440, right?"
"608650","612690"," It's because they don't have the up-to-date information they can release or they choose not to."
"613310","615750"," But what's actually dynamics of the market as they happen?"
"615950","622910"," So you have to take that shit on yourself, right, and adjust to how the market acts, right?"
"623050","625630"," We're at 440 fucking 4, 445 today at the close."
"626250","627390"," We're not supposed to be there. "
"627690","629250"," This isn't tail risk stuff either."
"632470","638590"," You know, so I want to apologize to Eric specifically, and some of you out there, that it's"
"638590","638810"," difficult."
"639210","639970"," You know, it's not easy. "
"640790","641990"," It is not easy."
"643310","644230"," And you're often wrong."
"644630","647370"," I'm wrong at least 20 to 30% of the time. "
"647370","649690"," And even when you're wrong, then you have to switch."
"650070","656830"," And seeing Josh do that today is that reminder that you have to be able to move."
"657430","659210"," And a lot of traders can't do that. "
"659730","661330"," It's not an easy concept."
"662270","667290"," There's been times when I've lost six figures not being able to make that move."
"667770","675070"," And I want Josh to know that's a very important, very important thing to know. "
"676270","678930"," Yeah, I can just feel it in the order flow."
"679510","680970"," Jason, I agree with you 100%."
"680970","681950"," But, you know, I've been wrong. "
"682050","682530"," And you've been wrong."
"682630","683610"," We've all been wrong out there."
"685090","685870"," And it's tough. "
"686470","689570"," Dude, it's brutal because you know what the worst part of this whole entire game is?"
"690670","692090"," It's in the back of your mind, right?"
"693750","694930"," It's in the back of your mind."
"695390","697450"," And then you're under the pressure of everybody else out there."
"698110","702090"," And then someone says something to you, or someone says to other people, or people start to"
"702090","702330"," question. "
"702890","703290"," Everybody does."
"703470","704390"," It's not like you're playing with me."
"704390","707030"," You guys are asking each other, double checking, triple checking. "
"707370","707770"," But you should."
"708250","712170"," But at the same time, you know that self doubt that comes up inside the back of your mind, right?"
"713290","714110"," I mean, shit."
"714770","715650"," Two fucking years. "
"716550","717650"," Two fucking years."
"719750","720850"," I'm a fucking bull."
"721710","725490"," Nobody in Twitter has ever heard me say we're breaking through this. "
"725890","727970"," Like once we hit that bottom, we didn't break it through there."
"729910","730770"," It's just not easy."
"731090","732390"," It's not easy to make that call. "
"733110","737310"," That's the stuff that, you know, got me bothered."
"737590","739490"," Anyways, I will get past all that bullshit."
"740110","741930"," I'm reading everything you guys are saying right now, by the way. "
"742470","743530"," I'm not looking at anything else."
"743670","744330"," I'm looking at your comments."
"745310","746430"," I appreciate all of your comments. "
"747990","748970"," You're right about that."
"749250","749910"," You're almost out of time."
"750670","751330"," But this is tough. "
"751590","752990"," You know, like, this is not an easy game."
"753670","760310"," This game right now, after 2020, after 2020, they tried to shake out all the meme pumpers."
"761270","766250"," Now, 2022, they're going to try to shake out all the day traders. "
"766930","767510"," That's their plan."
"768030","769390"," You know, Neil, we're going to talk about that."
"771210","772110"," We're going to talk about that. "
"772250","772850"," There's no saving."
"773070","774550"," There's a few things about what Neil's saying."
"774730","775410"," It's a good point. "
"775990","777570"," And we need to discuss at some point tonight."
"777690","778790"," It's going to keep it really simple tonight."
"780290","780870"," Thanks, Brad. "
"781790","782330"," Yeah, dude."
"782490","783050"," I was paranoid."
"783990","787790"," If you don't think for a minute, I wasn't looking at the scrolling text earlier. "
"787790","789650"," And then I saw one comment."
"790310","792150"," And I started to scroll up."
"792190","792770"," And then I was asking. "
"793030","796370"," And then I didn't actually, actually, at this point, I haven't gone back to see the entire"
"796370","797170"," conversation."
"797390","800730"," But I got the gist of the conversation quick enough."
"802090","803830"," And I understand that conversation. "
"804370","805550"," That conversation is important."
"806430","809290"," I know that some of you follow along the entire time."
"809450","810470"," Like, you're here every single video. "
"811050","813110"," You hear every single every time we talk about shit."
"813610","817770"," And we layer all of this stuff to get to this point to say, this is where we're going and"
"817770","818570"," why we're going there."
"818970","819710"," Now we could be wrong. "
"820650","824570"," But this isn't like just one day I came on the fucking microphone and said, hey, this is what we're"
"824570","825170"," doing this today."
"826590","827750"," We do this shit all day long."
"827850","828170"," We live it. "
"828270","828630"," We eat it."
"828650","829110"," We sleep it."
"829270","829770"," That's all we do. "
"831870","832930"," Yes, it's three to six months."
"833110","833610"," Roll over."
"833690","834050"," Sell the ribs. "
"834070","834450"," I agree."
"835510","835830"," 100%."
"835830","839390"," I love you guys more than you know. "
"839690","841090"," You guys don't know how much love you guys."
"842650","843350"," Thanks, Brad."
"844070","845230"," I bet I talked to you guys about something. "
"845450","846350"," It's important to understand."
"846550","846610"," Okay."
"848550","850710"," And I want to go back to one comment that was up here. "
"850790","852130"," There's one guy that said some Neil."
"853150","854270"," Neil said something."
"855090","856610"," I think Powell takes us down. "
"857150","861230"," They need to eviscerate excess money for the markets via crash and will increase labor supply."
"861590","862570"," But Neil said something else."
"865190","865810"," He did. "
"866110","868570"," He said, only Dovish Fed can save us."
"870290","876370"," Question is, does Powell Dov plus Vanna rally at all time highs or we sell down at 377 m a."
"876750","880950"," I think the 403 is higher."
"881210","882450"," I think I thought it was four or six. "
"882570","883530"," Maybe you think it's four or three."
"883990","884710"," Right now it's higher."
"884830","885670"," It's like four or eight or something. "
"885970","886590"," It doesn't really matter."
"886730","887610"," What really matters is this."
"891700","893280"," The important thing you guys have to understand. "
"893700","893880"," Sorry."
"894060","896640"," So we've got like Spock image did really well."
"897620","898840"," In a positive market. "
"900180","902800"," And Spock has a hard time like."
"905500","910540"," Updating you up to the minute up to the 10 minute up to a day as a live day trader."
"910820","911980"," You guys get to see you guys. "
"912040","915080"," You guys need to know that we do traditional charting."
"915540","916500"," We start there."
"917400","918800"," Then we look at traditional patterns. "
"920120","920220"," Right."
"921020","922320"," Then we throw in Elliott wave."
"923400","925780"," We throw in a regression channels. "
"925820","926920"," We throw in whatever you want."
"926920","927120"," Right."
"927220","929260"," You can name any kind of system that people have. "
"929620","930360"," We look at those."
"930920","932560"," Then we throw in the spot gamma shit."
"932700","932820"," Right. "
"933280","935340"," Negative gamma positive gamma which is misnomers."
"935940","937080"," We've got volatility zones."
"937420","937520"," Right. "
"939020","941700"," We're throwing in a book map on top of all that kind of shit."
"942180","946120"," Then in the background we're looking at volume profile, market profile."
"946420","948520"," All these other things are adding all these tools up. "
"949000","950740"," Then we're looking at how we feel."
"951580","953380"," Market news, unknown news."
"953980","955260"," A whole bunch of other shit in the background. "
"955820","957720"," Come up with what we think is going to happen."
"959440","962220"," Now one month, three months down the road, six months down the road."
"964080","966660"," And you know, it's a difficult job for all of us. "
"966920","968860"," And we all have to add to each other."
"969240","969280"," Right."
"969480","971780"," None of us have talked about volume of market profile today. "
"971900","973640"," None of us have talked about it."
"974640","975880"," At all past few days."
"976300","977780"," We look at it all the time on this channel. "
"978780","980360"," So anyway, but my point is that."
"981520","984520"," We take all this stuff together and then we have to pick away."
"984520","985360"," That we're going to go. "
"985640","987960"," And if we switch, we move right in the other direction."
"988360","990680"," And Josh personified that today."
"991160","991720"," Very important. "
"993460","996520"," And even though we're selling down right now, this overnight, right."
"996880","997900"," I'm going to switch over to something."
"998980","1000840"," You know, we're burning down tonight, right. "
"1001400","1003840"," At the close, I was saying to do this, do that."
"1004000","1006540"," But if you were going to short something, it's in tech, right."
"1007120","1008520"," We talked at the close today. "
"1009120","1011820"," About the implications of Netflix selling off."
"1011820","1015720"," Our assumptions about the banks selling off."
"1016220","1019880"," Whether it was good, bad, or how it was parlayed to us in the news. "
"1020640","1022440"," Who's looking for a reason to sell down."
"1022580","1026280"," We talked about how they'll air dirty laundry, all that kind of stuff."
"1027099","1028599"," And the implications of that, right. "
"1029000","1031060"," We talked about Peton today."
"1031339","1033640"," What it's effect is on speculative growth stocks."
"1034339","1038160"," You see the Netflix reaction after hours. "
"1038780","1041060"," And then how it implicated other big tech stocks."
"1041060","1041980"," After hours."
"1042640","1044079"," You see it right now. "
"1044280","1045579"," It's crazy right now, right."
"1045920","1049760"," Is the E.S. in the NQ after our charts."
"1050260","1051420"," Do not even reflect. "
"1052600","1053560"," Don't reflect."
"1054660","1057840"," The moves down after hours in some of these tickers."
"1058200","1066080"," The Amazon move down after hours is not reflected here to 1% or 1.35% move in the"
"1066080","1067140"," futures. "
"1067880","1068460"," It just doesn't."
"1068460","1071420"," It doesn't matter what the euro rich does."
"1071820","1072420"," It doesn't matter. "
"1072860","1073780"," It doesn't reflect it."
"1073920","1078940"," There's no way that we're down 1% on Amazon trading this deep down."
"1079340","1082500"," So what are these implications into the four o'clock hour?"
"1082720","1084080"," Four a.m. Eastern Standard Time, right. "
"1084240","1085840"," We don't know what those implications are."
"1086860","1088700"," We don't know what the implications are."
"1089380","1091700"," How fearful some retail bulls are. "
"1092000","1094260"," Small hedge funds that are long."
"1094740","1095560"," We're not talking Kathy Woods."
"1095560","1098120"," We're talking about the guy that's got that paid 130. "
"1098260","1099500"," I know about some of this shit."
"1099640","1100980"," You guys, I shouldn't tell you this stuff, but."
"1101520","1104580"," You know, like one of these small hedge funds pay 135 grand. "
"1104900","1105480"," You know, pay them."
"1105640","1108800"," They give you a class and you get your series seven."
"1109240","1111660"," And if you quit within three years, they charge you 130 grand. "
"1112040","1113140"," They have these small offices."
"1113500","1114560"," These these guys like craft."
"1115680","1117840"," Small baskets for investors. "
"1119080","1119980"," And they're going to wake up."
"1120060","1121620"," They already know they have meetings tonight."
"1122180","1124620"," There are meetings going across all country right now. "
"1125040","1129620"," That's what's going to take place at four a.m. How much risk are you putting out at this point"
"1129620","1135060"," where you don't have a charter or statements that lawyers sign and shit like that for what's going"
"1135060","1135900"," to happen tomorrow morning."
"1136020","1142140"," But even with all that said, even with all that shit said, you got to tell you guys."
"1142300","1143100"," I'm going to show you guys some. "
"1143240","1143400"," Okay."
"1143920","1144980"," Well, you guys see something."
"1146600","1147000"," Now. "
"1148020","1152220"," We know that we think that the market is priced into three to four rate hikes."
"1153000","1154620"," We heard Jamie Diamond, right?"
"1155680","1156780"," By the fucking dip."
"1158200","1159460"," Then comes out and says. "
"1160700","1162900"," Well, we're going to do seven rate hikes this year."
"1164880","1166120"," Now anticipate that."
"1166880","1168520"," So we priced in seven rate hikes. "
"1168940","1169760"," This looks like it."
"1170640","1170800"," Right."
"1172940","1175460"," Uh, there looks like the market is forcing there. "
"1175540","1178500"," It looks like not as much complacency than 2007."
"1179680","1181040"," This looks something like."
"1181860","1185860"," The banks don't want to get fucked over like they fucked themselves in the past to an extent. "
"1187080","1188700"," And they're going to price it in themselves."
"1189140","1190000"," I'm going to force this."
"1190240","1191420"," What's crazy about this?"
"1191740","1195080"," This is what's happening right now is what I want you guys to understand is. "
"1195520","1196960"," You've got indexes that are up here."
"1197420","1199180"," You've got a stealth correction down here."
"1199540","1200400"," Said this many times. "
"1200880","1202080"," They need to meet in the middle."
"1204080","1206040"," So in the indexes, they've never come down."
"1206180","1206520"," We know that. "
"1206520","1208880"," They need to come down and meet up with the south correction."
"1210320","1212020"," And even beyond that, right?"
"1212400","1215660"," So even beyond that, there were some companies that didn't take part."
"1217200","1221780"," In the correction today, like other companies, you had Netflix take part in it. "
"1222460","1223640"," Then you look at like a snap."
"1224480","1225160"," Or PayPal."
"1226160","1228440"," They didn't go below their last bottom a week or two ago. "
"1228900","1230220"," Thanks for long in those stocks."
"1231060","1232440"," You should have paid attention today."
"1233020","1238780"," Even the stocks that sold off that didn't sell off below their prior low within the last month. "
"1239800","1241160"," Zillow didn't take part of that."
"1242420","1243960"," So that was interesting to see."
"1244640","1249040"," Another thing that I want you guys to see is you see this sell down in the indexes, right?"
"1250180","1251560"," And let's say we sell down. "
"1251560","1257260"," Let's say we sell down the S&P 500 to $4.28. $4.40. Let's say we slammed down at"
"1257260","1258060"," $4.40 at the open."
"1258400","1259340"," Even if we don't, let's say we do."
"1259340","1267820"," Let's say we then trade down because now you guys hear about where the absolute put wall is, or the"
"1267820","1272040"," absolute gamma strike on puts is, which is even lower than the put wall. "
"1277880","1281580"," We knew before S.G. did, right?"
"1282220","1283580"," That we had 4.28 strikes."
"1284200","1286260"," We knew that more 4.28 strikes came in again."
"1286920","1291920"," And we did trade down below $4.50. Which nobody's radar. "
"1293400","1295780"," So we don't know what's going to happen tomorrow, right?"
"1296520","1303540"," The thing I want to talk to you about in this context is that we're going into OPEC's tomorrow."
"1304540","1309900"," We've got the specter of the Fed and their rates."
"1310320","1312900"," Maybe somebody knows something and they're going to announce seven rates, okay?"
"1313180","1314600"," It's going to price this in before you even get there. "
"1315340","1318980"," Let's say JPM Morgan or JP Morgan knew before GS."
"1319540","1321240"," Let's say GS knew before JP Morgan."
"1322440","1324980"," It doesn't matter what you guys to see something, okay?"
"1325740","1326920"," I want to bring something up to you. "
"1326940","1328020"," It's very important to see."
"1329000","1330900"," I want you to see this chart right here, okay?"
"1332760","1334280"," You guys know when this chart was from?"
"1335360","1339740"," This was the S&P 500 E-mini in 2020 in March."
"1341600","1345320"," It's important to note that this was an OPEC's. "
"1345860","1349500"," This was the March 21st, 23rd OPEC's over here."
"1350300","1351900"," This right here was the February OPEC's."
"1352480","1353220"," It doesn't matter the month. "
"1354200","1357920"," What does matter is that we had to sell down, rip higher, we sold down again."
"1359360","1363120"," What's really critical for you to see is that this is February 20th."
"1366790","1368270"," This is March 20th. "
"1368270","1373230"," Now, we had some announcements and shit that took place later, but I really want you to see a few"
"1373230","1374370"," key things, okay?"
"1375470","1382310"," It's important for a hedge fund or a bank, even if we slam lower on the open of the 20th"
"1382310","1387030"," for them to do what they need to do to decide if we're going up."
"1387450","1388650"," Look at this state right here."
"1389190","1389830"," We went down. "
"1390650","1391750"," Look at this state right here."
"1392110","1392450"," It went up."
"1392450","1394010"," It didn't really matter. "
"1394210","1403780"," The key thing that you need to see is that there was some time in here right there and right"
"1403780","1406800"," there where nothing happened."
"1408480","1412660"," Lots of churn, lots of decision making, all those kind of things."
"1413920","1416680"," And this is when we sold for COVID. "
"1419100","1420760"," This is an unknown event."
"1421580","1423020"," This is on the OPEX."
"1423300","1424560"," This is on the OPEX. "
"1425160","1431840"," I want you to key into this as we come into Friday, Monday, Tuesday."
"1433200","1435080"," I want to key into this."
"1435980","1437080"," So let's say this. "
"1437220","1440360"," Let's just pretend that this is this Friday, okay?"
"1442360","1444800"," You've heard one guy said we're going to have a Vanarelli."
"1445720","1448560"," I'm betting that a lot of you think the Vanarelli is there."
"1448560","1450920"," And then like something like that. "
"1451600","1452120"," Okay."
"1454840","1459120"," And even even the Vanarelli down here was there and then came back down."
"1459660","1461080"," So there's none of this going on. "
"1461080","1461340"," Okay."
"1461500","1461860"," I'm sorry."
"1463060","1468940"," And we don't we're not in COVID and we have blown this this whole entire chart up here. "
"1469580","1471400"," So do I think it's like the COVID thing?"
"1471880","1472000"," No."
"1472460","1475000"," Do the banks know right?"
"1475800","1477760"," Do the banks know what the feds going to step in?"
"1477920","1478100"," Yes."
"1478720","1484560"," So there's a few key points I want you to understand as we head into next week on the 26th. "
"1484720","1492820"," Number one, the banks are pricing in at this point more than three to four rate hikes."
"1493500","1502500"," They're doing the job of the Fed that does imply when we head into the Fed that they can't tell"
"1502500","1507100"," you that we're doing seven hikes or they can't tell you we're doing seven hikes."
"1507100","1510440"," And it's going to have the giant impact. "
"1510780","1516560"," We might still trade down here for like our normal like spring thing, but it's not going to be"
"1516560","1517480"," straight fucking down."
"1519220","1520680"," I want to see straight down."
"1521740","1526380"," I've got bets for three hundred one fifty crazy. "
"1527380","1530040"," Till bets that don't pay for them."
"1531720","1534200"," But why do you see the COVID trade?"
"1535360","1537300"," And the reason why I want you to see this because of this, okay?"
"1539500","1547740"," I want you to see it because there's a key part here that I haven't shown yet."
"1553060","1554820"," I want to show you this right here. "
"1554900","1555380"," This is important."
"1556500","1557300"," It's critical for you."
"1557360","1558960"," We haven't seen the V shape recovery. "
"1559740","1561980"," We haven't seen it in cash hours."
"1562920","1569060"," I want you guys to see something that's critical even when you have what at that time I was trading"
"1569060","1569460"," then right."
"1569780","1575080"," I remember I was still it was not an unknown event to me, but it was an unknown event to"
"1575080","1578040"," most of the market in terms of how bad it was going to be. "
"1578220","1581980"," I remember the conversations when people were saying it's not that bad."
"1582120","1583320"," I remember taking my kids out of school."
"1583740","1584840"," Matter of fact, quick story. "
"1586180","1587660"," I got CPS called."
"1587860","1589680"," I mean my kids because I took them out of school."
"1591560","1592920"," My I talked to the principal. "
"1593520","1594840"," I pulled my kids out of school."
"1595120","1596120"," I put them in homeschool."
"1596760","1598320"," I had CPS called on me. "
"1598460","1599460"," They thought I was overreacting."
"1599960","1601120"," And three weeks later."
"1602320","1603200"," They shut down the school. "
"1604080","1605420"," I got an apology phone call."
"1605980","1609460"," I got all kinds of crazy emails and phone calls still happen to this day."
"1610120","1613520"," Now, but what I want to show you guys is these moments. "
"1613840","1614000"," Okay."
"1614600","1616540"," I want to show so I want you guys to see something."
"1617860","1621260"," You know, these capitulation moves right here. "
"1623240","1627100"," I don't know how many guys were in the market then, but it was crazy."
"1627820","1630940"," You know, you can't tell me that the market knew we were trading down."
"1631320","1633640"," Even though what's his face said we were right. "
"1634080","1638980"," The famous like the guy from the one on CBC, whatever his name is, the famous fucking bull."
"1639600","1642020"," I'm telling you the rest of the market was in fucking denial."
"1642820","1644000"," That was not what was happening. "
"1644000","1649100"," I lived at first hand with my kids going to that moment right there."
"1649180","1649840"," We pushed down."
"1650940","1651740"," Trade sideways. "
"1652460","1654140"," We break up and then we keep trading down."
"1654580","1656600"," I want to show you this other one, right?"
"1656840","1658280"," You guys already know what I'm going to show you, right?"
"1659140","1659940"," Pitulation moves."
"1660500","1662480"," This doesn't imply that we're going up. "
"1663400","1665160"," There are these capitulation moves."
"1666420","1667760"," You can see another one right here."
"1668620","1668980"," Come on. "
"1669340","1671200"," I'm going to show you guys any more of these."
"1671680","1672720"," See that one right there."
"1674300","1677940"," Even though we went down, you know, we went back up. "
"1678700","1680680"," So sometimes bears don't understand this."
"1681180","1681620"," I'm a bull."
"1681920","1683260"," So I used to be a bear in those bull. "
"1683540","1685960"," But you guys see us come back up like this, right?"
"1686120","1687360"," It's still another pull up."
"1687780","1688440"," Another pull up."
"1688540","1690900"," You saw it in after hours in Peton. "
"1692060","1693100"," I'll bring up Peton real quick."
"1693840","1695060"," There's a couple of reasons for this."
"1695660","1697620"," There are people with more money than you and I."
"1697720","1698220"," They're banks. "
"1699000","1699860"," They're long-term investors."
"1700900","1701680"," I'll show Peton real quick."
"1701680","1702200"," I'll come back to ES. "
"1703160","1705720"," What I want to show you, Peton is important to look at."
"1709380","1710920"," You see this little sneaky people?"
"1711260","1711980"," Shit, they did over here."
"1714480","1716720"," Got this little fucking sneaky P they did. "
"1717320","1721140"," So let's just say, let's just say that I was a bank and I was long in Peton."
"1723860","1724900"," And we sold off."
"1725700","1728260"," I'm going to get a guy like Will Meade and pay him 50k. "
"1728900","1730400"," Something fucking stupid, right?"
"1731540","1734660"," He's going to help bring the price up so I can sell myself out of this."
"1735340","1736200"," That didn't work."
"1737420","1739420"," So I'm going to go into a little liquidity environment. "
"1740200","1740920"," Do the same shit."
"1741540","1743260"," I'll probably have something lined up over here."
"1744700","1745840"," There's some kind of stupid shit. "
"1746640","1748260"," To get on fuck myself."
"1750160","1751580"," Let's just say G.S. knew."
"1751760","1752940"," Let's say J.P.M. didn't. "
"1753540","1755260"," They have to do whatever they can."
"1755940","1758160"," When unknown news comes, it doesn't matter if it's good or bad."
"1758740","1760600"," When unknown, great news comes. "
"1760600","1761700"," You know we do."
"1762980","1764220"," Unknown, great news comes."
"1764440","1765520"," We go like this, right?"
"1766320","1767700"," Then all of a sudden we come back down. "
"1768440","1772140"," And then when they're ready and your calls suck, they bring it back up."
"1773160","1774200"," When unknown news comes."
"1775220","1775440"," Bad. "
"1775900","1777040"," They bring it down, right?"
"1777420","1777960"," They didn't know."
"1778320","1778700"," They got fucked."
"1779360","1780320"," Then they bring it back up. "
"1781100","1782540"," Do some stupid shit like this."
"1782940","1783620"," They fuck you."
"1784140","1786340"," And then they drop it down over six months or whatever. "
"1788140","1789520"," The same thing, both sides."
"1791260","1794280"," So I think they kind of knew but didn't know to some extent today."
"1794520","1797260"," What my point to you is that you're going to see. "
"1798660","1799660"," More than likely."
"1800980","1801860"," A snapback."
"1803620","1804060"," Okay. "
"1804920","1806980"," You're going to see a snapback in futures."
"1809520","1810760"," Let's show it to you right now."
"1812100","1814700"," You're going to see a snapback in futures at some point. "
"1815440","1817460"," You'll probably see it in cash market."
"1817460","1819020"," There's a few things going on."
"1819100","1820060"," Some mechanics in the background. "
"1820980","1824880"," You're going to see the mechanics of the banks wanting to position themselves."
"1825240","1826600"," They don't care about you as a retail trader."
"1827180","1828220"," They don't care about each other. "
"1828740","1832480"," They're going to either make our call wall higher or call wall lower."
"1832660","1834060"," They make our put wall lower or higher."
"1835080","1839700"," In the meantime, if they got fucked in here, if some guy got fucked in here, they're going to do"
"1839700","1842040"," whatever they can to raise this up to get unfucked. "
"1843560","1845220"," If they're going to go down or higher."
"1846520","1847760"," They didn't COVID."
"1848240","1851180"," It's very famous in 2007, 2008. "
"1851580","1853600"," You'd make more money in the way up in the way down."
"1854140","1856220"," I'm not saying that we don't crash in the morning."
"1856440","1861320"," I don't doubt for a minute that we don't trade down because of what happens in Netflix and the"
"1861320","1862620"," implications in cash market. "
"1863080","1863840"," Then we flip higher."
"1864520","1866860"," I don't know when this happens or how this happens tomorrow."
"1867880","1870740"," But the key point for you is you took it short today, right?"
"1871280","1873840"," Some of you took it left some on the table for the open tomorrow. "
"1873840","1875840"," So you take your money here, right?"
"1876420","1882100"," Even if we just trade in this area tomorrow or even if we trade down slowly tomorrow, I just want"
"1882100","1885460"," you to know that even in COVID, we trade it up."
"1886580","1889640"," When you hear this from me, I want you to know one other thing."
"1890580","1896100"," You're going to hear bulls tell you, well, this is an advantage rate, right?"
"1896620","1897260"," That's what they're going to say. "
"1897520","1898340"," This is an advantage rate, man."
"1899160","1899960"," Hold on."
"1900160","1901000"," Get rid of that one real quick. "
"1901000","1902340"," This is an advantage rate."
"1902660","1908440"," And so in your minds, thinking from a bull's perspective, you're thinking that that advantage rate"
"1908440","1911240"," is like all the others, right?"
"1911400","1917880"," Because all the other advantage trades are, we see it against a bigger time frame here."
"1920620","1921360"," That's kind of weird. "
"1922260","1923420"," So all the other advantage trades."
"1925480","1927500"," We can highlight this to the trash."
"1928240","1929980"," The trash doesn't matter where we go in the morning. "
"1930560","1931700"," None of this really matters."
"1931860","1937620"," The only thing that matters is that you print in the morning, what really matters is this, that"
"1937620","1939640"," you're going to hear people say, well, we've got to vanitrade coming."
"1940420","1941980"," We'll go really, really high, whatever. "
"1944440","1946640"," Then I'll discuss him, that is this fucking beautiful."
"1947580","1948940"," I couldn't call that in two years."
"1950300","1951540"," Let's just say you get to vanitrade. "
"1956340","1957980"," Your vanitrade, let's say it starts here."
"1958800","1959240"," Let's say it goes up."
"1959340","1960060"," It's not going here. "
"1960960","1963180"," The vanit fuel does not last this high."
"1965440","1967420"," So let's say your vanitrade goes up here, right?"
"1967980","1969140"," You're still in this channel."
"1969980","1972700"," If your vanitrade goes to here, it's still in this channel. "
"1973240","1975540"," If your vanitrade goes to here, it's still in this channel."
"1976260","1977360"," The bears are in control."
"1978680","1982960"," So I want you to realize that take your money and run down here, about where it opens up tomorrow"
"1982960","1984040"," morning, right?"
"1984560","1985700"," And you wait for your next opportunity. "
"1986460","1989440"," Now, something you're going to think, oh, we're going to trade right here and just start shooting"
"1989440","1989620"," down."
"1989620","1990020"," That's possible."
"1992260","1994760"," That's possibly trade up here and come down tomorrow. "
"1995320","1999100"," The only thing that you need to know is take the money off the table, right?"
"1999500","2001660"," Wait for the move up and then the drop down."
"2002520","2005360"," If you're a bull, we already talked about this, right?"
"2005520","2007020"," You're not doing any of this kind of bullshit here."
"2007820","2010920"," You're looking for something like this and then a move up. "
"2011740","2013860"," Or you're looking for a V-shaped recovery, right?"
"2014040","2016760"," We drop down here, slam down and shoot straight up."
"2017180","2018540"," You're going to see 70 to 100 handles."
"2019040","2024800"," At this point, you might see for a real recovery, you're going to see like 140, 150 handles on a"
"2024800","2025600"," Dave, believe it or not. "
"2025940","2028760"," You don't see that kind of shit in here, but we're still bearish."
"2030220","2035960"," But if you think we're going to straight fucking red bar down to like 440, you might hit 440 at"
"2035960","2037080"," the open because of the implications."
"2037680","2040800"," But if you think we're going to hit 428 tomorrow, probably fucking not. "
"2042380","2047340"," So I want you guys to still be conscious of where we are."
"2047800","2049159"," Maintain your composure."
"2051000","2052300"," If you didn't get in, right?"
"2052739","2054739"," Again, we're a month in, right?"
"2057580","2058620"," We're a month into this. "
"2059500","2061320"," If you still haven't taken the trade."
"2062639","2063500"," All right, fine."
"2064060","2065800"," If I swipe all the load, I can wipe it all out. "
"2065980","2066780"," They keep some of this stuff."
"2070340","2071659"," But we're doing this wrong."
"2073820","2076800"," The point is that take some profit off the table. "
"2077340","2082159"," There is one concern that the price of puts are going through the roof."
"2083020","2084440"," But you're taking the profit anyways."
"2084800","2088500"," So let's say you're paying 10 bucks for a put and you have to pay a dollar for a put"
"2088500","2093120"," that you pay in 10 and the price of that put goes up to the put or put goes up"
"2093120","2093780"," to 20 bucks. "
"2094020","2096500"," But you made $20 in profit and you're paying extra dollar for that premium."
"2096860","2097720"," No big deal."
"2098280","2106620"," But I do want you to realize still whether you're short, whether you're in cash market that there"
"2106620","2107260"," will be a moment. "
"2107760","2111520"," There will be a moment where the banks, where the rich people, even if they hate each other, are"
"2111520","2117480"," going to want some kind of a moment where there's some chilling out."
"2117880","2119900"," There's some sideways trading in here."
"2120040","2120600"," You got what I'm saying?"
"2121880","2123180"," And we're going to look tomorrow. "
"2124080","2129740"," Our job tomorrow, whether we trade down here and bounce up briefly."
"2131240","2132100"," Start going in this area."
"2132940","2137620"," Our job tomorrow is to see what they're hedging with. "
"2138300","2139320"," Are they hedging with?"
"2139520","2143640"," Are they replacing all those calls, those positive call deltas for us to go up?"
"2144060","2145900"," We have to be a little adjust if we see that."
"2146640","2152160"," If they start to adjust for us having a top of up here, right in a bottom way down here"
"2152160","2156260"," or something, I think they see some, I don't know if I can do that with this without a pointer."
"2157360","2159460"," You know, if they're telling you that it was 428. "
"2160740","2165660"," This was the new absolute gamma strike on the put side."
"2165780","2168860"," Let's say they were saying that this was not, it changed to 428."
"2169880","2173100"," Let's say they say it's not on here at 400 or some and go lower. "
"2173740","2180920"," Nothing go lower without a, maybe they, maybe they start placing puts down here."
"2183730","2185730"," Let's say they show you these cards tomorrow."
"2186810","2189810"," Let's say you know that it's now here for the next month. "
"2191570","2194910"," You know, if we trade down here, that we can still go up."
"2195650","2196950"," But even if we're going down eventually."
"2198090","2200570"," So just be, be conscious of this. "
"2200810","2200990"," Okay."
"2201690","2203470"," This new level down below."
"2204070","2206290"," This was known yesterday and today we knew this. "
"2206390","2207530"," We talked about this in the live stream."
"2208030","2210590"," That's why I was wrong that we can trade much lower than this."
"2210790","2212090"," We knew that we could trade lower than 450. "
"2212690","2213950"," We knew we could trade out a 440."
"2215210","2216130"," It's, we're too quick."
"2216310","2217310"," We're seeing too much information. "
"2217310","2221890"," And so tomorrow we need to see where they start to hedge."
"2222570","2223770"," When you look at spot camera, right?"
"2223990","2228670"," They're telling you that wherever it is, they're telling you this is the absolute gamma."
"2229050","2231810"," This is the absolute gamma on the put side. "
"2232410","2233190"," It's absolute up here."
"2233510","2236710"," Let's just say absolute absolute day to day."
"2236810","2237130"," It changes. "
"2237530","2238010"," Go to there."
"2238550","2239090"," Go to here."
"2239690","2240610"," Go higher up here. "
"2241310","2242310"," Go lower."
"2242310","2242750"," Go lower."
"2242890","2243270"," Go higher. "
"2243770","2249910"," So we, we really for this month have to see tomorrow specifically what's going to happen here."
"2250630","2253790"," And the last thing I'm going to leave you with is I'm going to go to a different chart."
"2254010","2256190"," I want to show you Netflix chart. "
"2256350","2260090"," We talked about this last Sunday."
"2260450","2261310"," It's an important one."
"2263910","2264350"," NLFX. "
"2264730","2264810"," Okay."
"2265130","2266430"," I'm getting this wrong."
"2269930","2270730"," NLX, right?"
"2270990","2271290"," Netflix. "
"2271490","2272350"," Oh, Jesus Christ."
"2272690","2273510"," I worry."
"2273710","2275150"," My think keyboard is not working. "
"2278630","2279490"," We got Netflix."
"2279790","2279890"," Okay."
"2283030","2285410"," This is part of what spot camera was talking about. "
"2288030","2293230"," I want to show you guys something."
"2293510","2293590"," Okay."
"2297670","2298630"," Back to an auto. "
"2300670","2302090"," It's March 2020 down here."
"2304230","2306150"," Netflix is worth $299."
"2307610","2308510"," Netflix at its peak. "
"2309630","2309990"," 696."
"2310830","2311350"," Not a ton."
"2311910","2312710"," But a ton, right?"
"2314950","2316190"," We talked today in the stream. "
"2316370","2316830"," We were up here."
"2317590","2318250"," We're up here."
"2318370","2318950"," We're down here. "
"2319490","2322030"," And I said, if they're going to trade up higher, there's going to make a pitulation moment."
"2323130","2326710"," Matter of fact, this is the same fucking, I haven't even made this chart."
"2326870","2327310"," This is old chart. "
"2328230","2329150"," We tagged right down here."
"2330410","2331730"," We should tag down here."
"2331730","2333970"," To an even higher trading range. "
"2334130","2338170"," I don't think what we do right now, but if you look back in history and these big tech names,"
"2338170","2338790"," they do this."
"2339090","2339870"," This happens."
"2341030","2350110"," What I'm talking about this, what's important about this is that back here in March 2020, moved all"
"2350110","2352730"," the way up to 700 bucks. "
"2353710","2356030"," Then you have a company like, let's say, Snap."
"2358670","2360670"," Which I don't want to trade Snap right now either."
"2360670","2361950"," But we're going to look at it. "
"2362890","2369750"," Because they're almost, they're almost back to March 2020."
"2370470","2371970"," They've already had this happen."
"2372530","2373470"," Netflix has not. "
"2374870","2375090"," Okay."
"2375470","2378490"," So snaps already had their self correction."
"2380290","2383490"," And shockingly, not shockingly, shockingly, not shockingly. "
"2384450","2386830"," Netflix didn't participate today."
"2387890","2390110"," They participated, but they didn't participate."
"2390570","2396250"," They didn't, like, Snap didn't fucking trade down here today, right?"
"2396690","2400630"," They should, they will probably in March, but they didn't participate today. "
"2401170","2404950"," They didn't drop down to, to their August 20th."
"2405590","2408890"," They didn't drop down to their March 20th, right?"
"2410270","2416390"," So my point to you is, as the stocks trade down, as big tech trades down, you're going to see"
"2416390","2425930"," the indexes move down to meet up where the snaps are, where the SQs are, and those kind of things."
"2426450","2431350"," So you want to pay attention to those stocks that are close to this bottom at the same time, right?"
"2431790","2438470"," If they don't participate in these things, this is where the key point of SG was talking about. "
"2441310","2449370"," SG said, we don't know if the call delta rolling off is on companies like Netflix that have been"
"2449370","2453170"," pumped up to here."
"2456280","2462620"," Because there's a ton of call data are called delta rolling off companies that have been correcting"
"2462620","2471520"," since, this is October, but if you look at SQ, if you look at some other tickers that we talked"
"2471520","2476840"," about last Sunday, they've been correcting since February of 2021, right?"
"2476980","2481400"," Some of the, some of the bunch of these stocks have been correcting way back here, but they have"
"2481400","2484820"," some of the same call delta rolling off as a Netflix."
"2485600","2495300"," So if they're already here, they imply that Netflix will sell off, but that the call delta"
"2495300","2501140"," that's positive supposedly rolling off companies that have been shorted down into OPEX might just"
"2501140","2501680"," push up. "
"2503700","2509060"," So between now and Tuesday, still pay attention to companies like Z, right?"
"2509660","2510680"," I've got this thing."
"2510820","2511860"," I'll bring it up for you right now, right?"
"2512000","2512580"," I don't know if I can't."
"2512660","2513400"," Maybe I can't. "
"2513420","2513880"," Hold on a second."
"2514720","2516400"," I'll bring this up for you guys one more time."
"2517160","2518140"," Give me two seconds here. "
"2519080","2520220"," I'm going to mute this."
"2521560","2522600"," I'm going to bring up."
"2522780","2524640"," I don't want to guys see my login credentials. "
"2528000","2528880"," Google Docs."
"2532160","2533800"," I want to show you guys something."
"2536440","2537560"," Go to Docs. "
"2538240","2539080"," Is it Sheets?"
"2539220","2539740"," I'm in the wrong one."
"2540060","2540160"," Hold on."
"2540660","2541300"," Google Sheets. "
"2547060","2549780"," I want to show you guys something once again from last Sunday."
"2555240","2557280"," They tagged a bunch of these companies."
"2557580","2559180"," They tagged Tesla, Google. "
"2560180","2562580"," They tagged, oh, they think they said, I don't know if they tagged Google."
"2563280","2567260"," They tagged, oh, hold on here."
"2568060","2569980"," They tagged Tesla, right?"
"2570180","2571840"," They tagged Netflix. "
"2572720","2576100"," There was like five companies that they tagged as having delta rolling off."
"2577120","2579540"," Call delta rolling off on Friday."
"2581800","2587920"," But the things that we were keyed in on last Sunday, let's see if I can do this right here. "
"2589160","2597180"," Things that were keyed in on Spock Amazon was that you're looking at companies like, let's scroll"
"2597180","2597940"," down through here."
"2598080","2598840"," Same list, right?"
"2599060","2599420"," Nothing's changed."
"2600060","2601000"," The company's like Z."
"2603080","2603800"," Wrong one. "
"2604940","2611500"," Right at the top, 203% of positive call delta rolling off on Friday."
"2612780","2614140"," And let's look at Z."
"2625200","2626620"," This is March 2020."
"2628300","2629220"," They were already down. "
"2629640","2630700"," They didn't participate today."
"2631700","2633960"," They didn't participate today in the sell-off."
"2634720","2638240"," They tagged a previous low back here in December 1st. "
"2639060","2641300"," This is where they started when the banks picked them up."
"2642560","2646800"," And they have positive, huge call delta rolling off on Friday."
"2648040","2652740"," And I think the implication that actually was saying, they said, we don't know who's going to sell"
"2652740","2652940"," off. "
"2653060","2654540"," We don't know what the hedging is."
"2654640","2658300"," We don't know if they're short calls, if they bought stock."
"2658500","2665520"," We don't know if they're shorting these short positions with stock as it traded down, right?"
"2666360","2668380"," So we're coming up and raise buying calls. "
"2669200","2671260"," And the dealers have to delta neutral, right?"
"2671380","2672320"," And they have to make money the way down."
"2672740","2674780"," You've got banks in back here, right?"
"2674960","2675580"," Banks are back here."
"2675580","2676460"," They're buying this, right?"
"2677060","2677900"," Buy a bunch of calls. "
"2678120","2679240"," You've got soft bank jumping in."
"2679340","2680240"," You've got a bunch of shit going on."
"2680280","2681000"," We're going way up, right?"
"2682100","2684480"," And you've got a bank down here at $24. "
"2685100","2689240"," We're now up to $200 or $200, $26, right?"
"2689580","2689700"," $29."
"2690200","2691700"," They sell out, right?"
"2692020","2693300"," And they own this stock."
"2694020","2695780"," They bought all the calls going up. "
"2696280","2700520"," And then they're going to short all this shit down, sell out at peaks."
"2701180","2704360"," They put all of these peaks into a, here it's called."
"2704500","2708560"," It's a mathematical equation where they get the maximum profit they can after they sell out as they"
"2708560","2708940"," sell down. "
"2709180","2713160"," It's like selling into buyers, something's called, here it's called, but I studied it a long time"
"2713160","2713420"," ago."
"2714160","2716380"," But they're selling into, it's not selling in a week."
"2716520","2718520"," There's selling the strength they think it's called. "
"2719880","2723460"," And you keep thinking that it's coming back and it's not, and you keep buying the bags as it rolls"
"2723460","2724200"," down the hill, right?"
"2724680","2726200"," And at the meantime, they're shorting it, right?"
"2726380","2728340"," At the very end, right?"
"2728520","2730080"," They still own a shit ton of stock here."
"2731280","2733000"," And they've shorted it down to fucking nothing."
"2733800","2738460"," And they have this moment where they can actually sell the last of the stock that they own. "
"2739380","2740380"," Price goes down."
"2741380","2742060"," They're shorts print."
"2742980","2745300"," They get all their money out of their stock options, right?"
"2745460","2746040"," And they buy it. "
"2748020","2749860"," It's like brief moment where it comes up."
"2750260","2759100"," Now, you compare Zillow versus the Tesla for as you roll into this Opex, and what difference do you"
"2759100","2760560"," see here is, of course, right?"
"2760920","2761980"," Zillow's gone down for a year."
"2762680","2763320"," Two years, almost. "
"2763520","2764640"," I think it was December or something."
"2765400","2768280"," February of 2021, it's gone down for almost an entire year."
"2769020","2769880"," Or at the end of fucking January. "
"2771560","2772940"," So what's the implication of this?"
"2774780","2775620"," Something's going to happen."
"2775960","2780380"," I can't tell you right now if it's straight fucking up, or if it's straight fucking down and then"
"2780380","2786940"," up, I can tell you for shit sure, though, that whatever happens to fucking Tesla tomorrow or Monday"
"2786940","2790780"," or Tuesday will be different than what happens to Zillow."
"2791640","2799680"," And both are under the same circumstances as Zillow is. "
"2800280","2801480"," And they both have different charts."
"2804640","2807860"," And you see Zillow didn't participate today."
"2809020","2811900"," You see that the banks took it down here at 22 bucks. "
"2812520","2813620"," So I'm interested in this."
"2814300","2815820"," I want to see what happens here."
"2816240","2817980"," You guys are all interested in what happens to Tesla. "
"2818060","2819800"," I'm interested in what the fuck's going to happen to Zillow."
"2820140","2823200"," Now, I don't know that Zillow's the best company or whatever, but it's not a Peton."
"2823880","2825240"," I know that Zillow's not a Peton. "
"2825620","2828900"," We talked about last weekend, Peton's not a fucking Zillow."
"2828900","2832160"," We know SKU is not, or PayPal is not an SKU."
"2832340","2836500"," We know SKU is still better than a lot of companies in a lot of senses, right?"
"2836680","2837880"," They're going to survive through something like this. "
"2838260","2839520"," We're going to absorb it by another company."
"2840400","2843280"," And we know the Viacom is probably going to deal with them on the road, even though they got"
"2843280","2847880"," whacked today, even though some of the Disney got whacked because of Netflix."
"2849660","2854120"," But I'm interested in this trade as we head into Friday, especially if we trade sideways in the US"
"2854120","2856220"," into Monday. "
"2857380","2858980"," Even if we dump the clothes tomorrow."
"2859780","2861520"," I'm interested in trades like this."
"2862380","2866500"," I posted this list to you guys on Twitter at Catherine's handle. "
"2867540","2868460"," There's a bunch of these."
"2868700","2868900"," EXP."
"2870840","2872020"," I don't know about a CERN. "
"2872540","2873640"," That was a great trade, though."
"2874100","2874680"," Pretty COVID."
"2876440","2877220"," Like Chrome. "
"2877620","2878400"," I'll never trade that again."
"2879780","2882440"," That trade was like five years ago, but like five."
"2883000","2884440"," I think that's Fiver, right?"
"2884440","2885920"," A store. "
"2886040","2887380"," Someone tells $5 shit."
"2888400","2889940"," Get a bunch of a bunch of others in here."
"2890080","2890260"," Play. "
"2892340","2892820"," Blink."
"2893180","2894380"," Blink had a rip the other day."
"2895260","2896280"," Peton had a rip. "
"2897140","2898520"," Z had a rip the other day."
"2899740","2903440"," It's almost like they're showing you pre or like the GME shit."
"2904560","2905580"," Spotify, right?"
"2905940","2906060"," Spotify. "
"2907780","2909140"," What can you say about that?"
"2909440","2909760"," ENPH."
"2910960","2911000"," Pen."
"2912080","2912720"," Then there's Tesla. "
"2912720","2915080"," Tesla is a hundred and seven percent."
"2916300","2922040"," I don't know what the interplay is on Tesla and Zillow, but I know that they've had two different"
"2922040","2922640"," fucking years."
"2924100","2928260"," They're saying that there's an implication that something's going to happen to Tesla. "
"2929740","2933720"," If there's going to be an implication of something going to happen to Tesla, I'm assuming there's"
"2933720","2936460"," going to be an implication of something that's been beaten down for a year."
"2937280","2937860"," Just pay attention."
"2937860","2939480"," I'm not saying that you have to trade these. "
"2939660","2943980"," I'm saying that it yourself like a nine chart screener."
"2945100","2951860"," Just pop up all these tickers as we move into Friday, as we move into Monday and Tuesday, and plug"
"2951860","2955160"," in some of these tickers that are up on this list."
"2956820","2961600"," I have a feeling, not a feeling, but it could be interesting. "
"2962160","2964280"," Do you guys think the test is going to rip to 1,300?"
"2965460","2967920"," Does that mean that Zillow goes down to 20 bucks?"
"2969120","2973320"," Then Tesla sells off at 1,300, and Zillow rips up another 780 points."
"2974740","2976060"," I don't know what's going to happen."
"2976300","2977080"," Wrap is another one. "
"2977340","2978200"," There's a bunch of these in here."
"2978340","2981400"," You've got Wayfair, one of the most shorted stocks out there."
"2982340","2986040"," I've traded Wayfair when there were short squeezes. "
"2986480","2994260"," Wayfair can sometimes trade 300 handles, right?"
"2994780","2996060"," I've seen W do this."
"2996840","2998760"," It's weird that a bunch of these are in here."
"3002520","3005340"," Yeah, you know, Stop Run City is making a good point back here. "
"3005400","3007120"," I'm not watching you guys' comments right now."
"3007340","3012100"," Stop Run City says bottom line is just to be able to think in terms of probability, except the"
"3012100","3013040"," variance that comes with it."
"3013520","3014080"," It's a good job. "
"3014260","3016240"," I might sound crazy to a bunch of you guys right now."
"3023040","3025420"," I just had to pay the captain what I heard of."
"3025840","3030520"," You can pay here on, you can pay right here is that there's a donate button right on the"
"3030520","3034720"," description or you go to fucking that captain's alpha. "
"3034720","3039080"," If you don't want to join PayPal and I understand why PayPal is an evil company."
"3044450","3049090"," So a question is, why wouldn't they rug pull mega caps just like they did with most of growth"
"3049090","3049490"," stocks?"
"3049950","3053110"," They should pull, they should rug pull mega caps."
"3053570","3057670"," I don't want to join our talking over today. "
"3057710","3061070"," I was like, I don't want to fucking pay for mega caps right now."
"3061950","3063770"," I don't want to, I don't, I'm not paying for it."
"3064630","3066510"," I don't think anybody else is paying for it. "
"3066830","3070070"," I think we're forcing the fed into position, right?"
"3070270","3071710"," Raise rates, lower inflation."
"3072290","3073370"," We'll eat the bullet right now."
"3074230","3076550"," I don't want to do back in the day. "
"3077130","3080930"," I could place a trade, not even 2020, before 2020."
"3081330","3082330"," You could let it legitimately."
"3082710","3086810"," If you knew where the trend line was going, you could place a trade for one to two months out. "
"3087530","3088770"," Something slightly in the money."
"3088770","3092210"," And if you were on the right trend line, it printed."
"3093050","3095250"," Unless something was unknown in the market, up or down. "
"3098750","3099330"," Stonk's anonymous."
"3099650","3099970"," I haven't checked."
"3100870","3102310"," I haven't checked if I got a tip. "
"3103810","3105470"," Oh, Mr. Bliss subscribed."
"3106810","3108030"," Stonk's anonymous tipped."
"3109130","3110170"," Thank you Stonk's anonymous. "
"3111610","3112910"," Betty Mac tipped."
"3113330","3115350"," Dirty, dirty, dirty boys."
"3116270","3117490"," Urged to right tipped. "
"3119730","3122210"," Oh, three Scott tipped earlier today."
"3122490","3123290"," Seven hours ago."
"3124070","3125290"," Josh subscribed. "
"3126870","3129330"," Captain Ron slamming it down."
"3131130","3135050"," The pay, if you don't tip here on the YouTube channel, you go to the handle."
"3135710","3136630"," That captain's off with a tip. "
"3136630","3138810"," I don't see those."
"3139370","3144550"," So every Friday, do something special for anyone that tipped straight straight through credit card."
"3145070","3146950"," So I'll show you guys out tomorrow. "
"3148210","3149390"," And we'll do a thing."
"3149530","3151010"," We usually have a cocktail or something like that."
"3151090","3153230"," By the way, I'm going to slow down here for a minute. "
"3155830","3156530"," It's late night."
"3156650","3168690"," It was a good day today, wasn't"
"3168690","3168690"," it?"
"3175320","3176980"," Let me see what you guys are saying."
"3177300","3178360"," I'm drinking a whiskey right now. "
"3179020","3180160"," I didn't even have a sip of it."
"3180640","3181180"," First one."
"3183000","3184240"," Yeah, bottom shelf on me. "
"3184460","3184780"," Bottom shelf."
"3184940","3185800"," I need two stocks."
"3186200","3186520"," I love you. "
"3189700","3194220"," Came here expecting Captain shotgunting white claws."
"3195400","3196140"," We did that."
"3196280","3196700"," Didn't we once?"
"3196900","3197360"," It was disgusting. "
"3198380","3200180"," I think I almost threw up when we did that."
"3203040","3204580"," Let me see what you guys are talking about here."
"3205660","3206760"," I think I'm back up here. "
"3206860","3208580"," I'm going to get you guys involved in this."
"3209460","3210720"," Pulling me scroll up a little bit more."
"3212540","3214000"," No Tesla's not going to 1,300. "
"3214840","3216040"," Jason, I'll be there soon."
"3217100","3218960"," Maybe not tomorrow, Scott, but it will next week."
"3219620","3219900"," I wouldn't. "
"3219980","3222340"," They rug pull make caps like they did with most of the girls."
"3222620","3225380"," We'll probably see a rug pull at open tomorrow to an extent."
"3226140","3227520"," You're going to see some heavy implications. "
"3228100","3229980"," I don't think that we don't sell down."
"3230160","3233300"," But my point to you is the banks have shit they got to do."
"3233820","3235360"," And they're not going to deal with the drama. "
"3237620","3241600"," Or they're going to deal with the fucking drama while they have to make their place their bets."
"3243420","3244800"," Wayfare is a great fucking model."
"3248480","3251820"," James posted a response to this broadcast on your Twitter. "
"3252960","3253360"," Yeah."

"3253880","3256820"," Tesla went to their test for Audi to deep-fried boot with this good live. "
"3259140","3260460"," Netflix was a warning shot."
"3261000","3264940"," So if you're, let's say you weren't logged in Netflix, but you were long and deep in the money"
"3264940","3269200"," calls on Apple or deep in the money calls on Amazon."
"3271760","3272520"," Forget it, right?"
"3277160","3282340"," Have I considered that shorts may be closed profit taken to fund declines, margin calls and larger"
"3282340","3282660"," tech?"
"3283880","3284920"," Yes and no. "
"3285460","3287580"," I'm looking at more from a larger viewpoint."
"3288380","3293520"," I'm looking at it from, I don't care if we trade up at the open to be frank with you."
"3294060","3295100"," We don't trade like that. "
"3295160","3300320"," We kind of trade from perspective of the gamma in the market, tops in the bottoms is the top and"
"3300320","3301460"," bottom moving up and down."
"3302060","3306840"," We have till risk on the up and bottom, of course, and where are we headed, right?"
"3308360","3310600"," Where are we inside of that range?"
"3310600","3316020"," We hear here as that range moves and are we going along or short within that range?"
"3320400","3323860"," Yeah, I'm not saying that either, Jake, about like Tesla beating earnings."
"3324360","3330440"," You know, Tesla could get the best guys in the world, unless just like Peton today, unless there's"
"3330440","3337180"," something unknown to the market like the next company or a stock split, it doesn't matter. "
"3337400","3342140"," And if there was a time for a company to give bad news, it is right now."
"3343640","3344980"," I don't think we see 20% overnight."
"3347060","3348060"," Betty Mac saying what?"
"3348260","3350500"," Shotgunting in right clause, getting taught some hard serious truth. "
"3351160","3352160"," Thanks, Betty Mac, brother."
"3357520","3361840"," All right, so I'm back to the bottom of the chat right now."
"3366680","3370140"," Hey, hey, Avery, Avery, good to see you, brother. "

"3391320","3393060"," We can do like two, three, four people."
"3393520","3397500"," Any of you guys, whether you know what you're talking about or don't, I don't care. "
"3397900","3399300"," If you're just funny, I don't care."
"3399760","3402520"," If you guys just want to be in the show, whatever, more than welcome."
"3403420","3407340"," I think that I would rather listen to people that know what they're talking about, not know what"
"3407340","3407940"," they're talking about. "
"3407940","3410280"," Some people know too much and talk too much."
"3410840","3414440"," So if you want to be in the show, whatever, I'd love to have you."

"3416720","3419300"," There are times in this day where I just don't want to fucking talk."

"3424120","3424880"," they've met, right?"
"3425120","3425560"," Talk to these guys."
"3426320","3429420"," They just put the show on every day and they drive about their day. "
"3429640","3430180"," They're in their office."
"3430500","3434700"," They go out and do their thing and they just want to hear people talking in the background, right?"
"3434820","3436240"," Cute them updated as things go on."
"3439080","3442000"," So reach out to me and we'll eventually get you on the show. "
"3443760","3445240"," I love interviewing people."
"3445660","3446300"," Yeah, I'm on bourbon."
"3449990","3451170"," Yeah, I'll talk to you. "
"3451250","3454270"," Jason, I'd like to introduce, or I'd love to interview like Jason."
"3455110","3456990"," There's a few of you out there that know I want to talk to."
"3457130","3457970"," Josh, you want to talk to?"
"3458590","3459250"," Without a doubt. "
"3459610","3459970"," Chaz."
"3461030","3461750"," Josh tool."
"3462170","3462750"," Josh the tool. "
"3463250","3463690"," He's a moderator."
"3464170","3465670"," Ben, I want to talk to you."
"3466470","3467730"," There's a whole bunch of you guys out there. "
"3468110","3469290"," Mary, I want to talk to you."
"3469290","3470090"," Mary is a gangster."
"3470850","3473370"," I don't know how much you guys know about Mary, but she makes bank. "
"3474450","3475550"," We're all regular people."
"3476930","3478310"," I want to hear everyone of your stories."
"3482290","3483610"," Oh, you interviewed for Rivian. "
"3483810","3484350"," Big dumpster."
"3484490","3485670"," I got family that worked for them."
"3486010","3488230"," You ever need a job at a hot rod?"
"3488430","3490990"," If you need a job at a Tesla or anything, let me know. "
"3491590","3491830"," You can talk."
"3493930","3496670"," How to get your attention and futures with thoughts analysis."
"3497370","3497730"," It's tough. "
"3497910","3500910"," I used to use trade futures."
"3501930","3503610"," I know that futures matter."
"3505790","3510950"," I've switched to more relying upon futures to help me in cash market. "
"3511670","3515310"," The key for me now is I pay attention to futures traders."
"3515630","3517570"," I pay attention to Globex foreign traders."
"3518830","3521190"," I don't pay attention to foreign markets. "
"3521190","3529750"," I used to, but I rely upon a Globex trader to key me into a day trading in cash market."
"3530070","3538150"," I'm assuming that there's enough smart Globex and futures traders that follow cash market traders"
"3538150","3541490"," so they get the handoff on the gist for the day."
"3543590","3546330"," I know they can be more technical in Globex and futures. "
"3547270","3551170"," If there's some day traders in cash that trade the same way because they come from futures market,"
"3551490","3556750"," but it's good to do the baton pass between Globex traders and cash market."
"3557610","3558910"," We trade well together."
"3559390","3563810"," If there's any overlap in the morning or in the afternoon night time, it's like really fucking"
"3563810","3569490"," baller to have a Globex trader converse with you about what they think's going to happen and what"
"3569490","3574150"," cash market saw happen and what cash market expectations are for the next day. "
"3574770","3576630"," That communication between retail traders is important."
"3576630","3582710"," Pro traders sometimes Globex traders call themselves that, but I try to sleep at night time,"
"3582710","3583350"," believe it or not."
"3583610","3586530"," When I traded off the creative futures, I couldn't sleep. "
"3587370","3589290"," It was up 24 hours of fucking day."
"3589990","3591670"," We tried in cash market, traded overnight."
"3593110","3593550"," Bonkers. "
"3594270","3598270"," And the guys that only trade nights, all the fucking power to you."
"3604400","3606480"," Down the road, how do we get your attention?"
"3606480","3611000"," Because I had Netflix and spy analysis putting us where we are now."
"3611900","3613140"," It's tough right now, Neil. "
"3614940","3617600"," So we just started, well, I shouldn't say we just started."
"3617820","3620000"," We started this like a bunch of our friends, right?"
"3620640","3621900"," Oh, yeah, horse lover is the shit."
"3622320","3626680"," So just so you guys know, horse lover and I, horse lover and I came on Twitter from we, we"
"3626680","3627940"," ran from Wall Street bets. "
"3628680","3631060"," And we were, we followed each other right out the gate."
"3631340","3633760"," I think we were both like five followers of some shit like that."
"3634380","3636620"," And we, we were very close for a time. "
"3636740","3638420"," And then we both kind of branched off and did our own thing."
"3639000","3640020"," Great guy, great trader."
"3641240","3642400"," Old school Wall Street better. "
"3645640","3646440"," Oh, yeah, brother."
"3647280","3648200"," You're in defense industry."
"3648420","3648900"," You know what's up. "
"3651440","3652800"," It's intense work in there."
"3652880","3654240"," They kind of kill you as an engineer."
"3656120","3656940"," But hold on. "
"3657000","3658320"," Let's go back to some things here."
"3658800","3661800"," A few things I want to talk about."
"3663000","3663900"," How do you get my attention?"
"3664200","3664360"," Okay. "
"3664540","3665820"," So normally it would be easy."
"3666760","3668760"," And normally no problems."
"3668900","3669440"," We could chitchat. "
"3669960","3672600"," And then I had, so how's how it started was I was on Twitter."
"3672900","3674320"," I was on Wall Street bets for a long time."
"3674420","3675320"," That was on Vegas bets. "
"3676300","3677700"," Now then this crazy shit happened."
"3677900","3678280"," Get out of there."
"3678620","3679120"," Come on to Twitter. "
"3679480","3679880"," Everything was normal."
"3680200","3680560"," Chitchat."
"3680780","3681080"," DM. "
"3682140","3682500"," Notifications."
"3683880","3684960"," Then shit blew up on Twitter."
"3685460","3687200"," Then I tried to make a private Twitter handle. "
"3688520","3690120"," I was doing daily briefs typed."
"3690600","3693000"," And then I tried to make a private Twitter handle."
"3693140","3694700"," And then I find always not bots. "
"3695060","3697500"," But like literally like hedge funds watching shit."
"3697700","3698980"," It's weird shit going on right now."
"3699420","3700740"," Even on the private Twitter handle. "
"3701300","3703160"," So I'm like in this overlapping that."
"3703260","3704960"," I'm doing video recorder videos."
"3705760","3707800"," And I am like some fucking weird thing. "
"3707920","3710400"," I'm like going to do some live streams for an hour."
"3710520","3711520"," And they turn to all day long."
"3712260","3715280"," But I'm like I'm going to make a make a website. "
"3715280","3717400"," I'm going to do like a discord and all this kind of stuff."
"3717700","3719380"," So right now things are so crazy."
"3720040","3720680"," Like the amount of time. "
"3720860","3721820"," I'm pretty much working."
"3724120","3725360"," Three four in the morning."
"3728260","3730200"," Till right now right midnight. "
"3730620","3733400"," So I'll I'll log out of here sleep for four hours."
"3734000","3735180"," I'll get up three four."
"3736040","3737220"," Check work on stuff. "
"3737660","3738680"," Try to get things prepped."
"3739280","3743540"," I might try to take a nap between like five six in the morning until eight eight thirty."
"3744400","3747040"," Take shower of shower with kids up. "
"3747960","3749240"," Make sure the kids are in school."
"3749800","3752000"," And then I come do this live show right now all day long."
"3752100","3754060"," It should slow down towards more simple. "
"3754660","3756700"," Where I'm just trading and you guys are here with me."
"3757800","3765060"," But I'm trying to automate some of the stuff and be available to answer DMS or spend time in"
"3765060","3765280"," discord."
"3765600","3766020"," You like that. "
"3766020","3774080"," This salt some the snowball of all the stuff is happening so fast that I need like probably week"
"3774080","3776180"," two three weeks to make everything right."
"3776620","3783080"," So that I can tone down all of the demand and then be available."
"3783500","3786960"," Just chat or if you've got some going to be quite frank with you. "
"3788520","3788920"," Neil."
"3791680","3795980"," There's a ton of guys in that discord that I've been trading with since or for a long time."
"3796180","3799060"," So they're not my soldiers. "
"3799300","3801640"," These are guys that care about making money."
"3802020","3803720"," So if you just talk to them for right now."
"3804760","3806740"," That's how the communication happens. "
"3807760","3809120"," You guys bring it up in stream."
"3809460","3811080"," You guys talk to me in shadow all the time."
"3811520","3812560"," You guys correct me. "
"3812780","3815000"," Emerson comes in here and fucking points shit out to me."
"3815000","3817540"," I got guys that point shout to me all day long that I missed."
"3818860","3823460"," I'm never the never the guy that says my way is the only way. "
"3823900","3826120"," Never the guy that says I was right."
"3826580","3827880"," I lose trades on here."
"3828200","3829560"," You got some of you guys have been here long enough. "
"3829820","3831480"," I get smoked all the fucking time."
"3831960","3836300"," But you know enough where I get smoked or I have to hold something longer than I wanted to."
"3836760","3837620"," I have to roll something. "
"3838360","3840400"," We're breaking classes on that stuff as a matter of fact."
"3841660","3843360"," Yesterday I was buying the clothes."
"3843680","3847880"," I started buying the dip and then I rolled into the clothes and then today I went green. "
"3848560","3850300"," And then I bought puts into the clothes today."
"3850640","3852240"," And those printed two different kinds."
"3852960","3856140"," And the crazy part is you have to know when to fold them. "
"3856260","3857080"," You have to know when to roll them."
"3857440","3859500"," You have to know when to hold them and all that kind of stuff."
"3860740","3866620"," I got to make videos about that stuff because I can't explain it in a moment. "
"3868100","3871240"," It takes a lot of it's complex to know what to do."
"3872460","3876060"," You have to layer all of it to know how to protect yourself."
"3876700","3877480"," And I've gotten burned. "
"3878140","3880440"," I got burned recently for like fucking 15 grand."
"3880720","3881420"," We're trading Tesla."
"3882540","3885480"," And some of you guys said, you know, come with us right now where we are. "
"3885660","3887180"," I think I don't feel we were inside your fault."
"3888080","3891040"," But we thought we were going to 1100 or something from like 1050."
"3891500","3894240"," We fucking traded down to like 900 the next day. "
"3894240","3896520"," And I held into the clothes when I should have closed."
"3897240","3898260"," And I lost everything."
"3898620","3899960"," Every fucking last dollar was gone. "
"3900680","3901620"," I was like a week or two ago."
"3901860","3902940"," Some of you guys remember that."
"3903640","3905120"," You got smoke fucking smoke showed. "
"3907200","3907980"," You know, I've traded."
"3908220","3909320"," I've lost with you guys twice."
"3909720","3910140"," I think. "
"3911260","3912380"," But it doesn't matter."
"3912620","3913100"," I love you guys."
"3913100","3913760"," It's awesome. "
"3913960","3914760"," You guys fucking tip dude."
"3914900","3916700"," Like I love all of you guys."
"3918340","3920760"," You know, but then a lot of trades go really well. "
"3920960","3923640"," You guys can look back the time that we've been live streaming."
"3923640","3928020"," And the reason why I ultimately went to a live stream was because I was getting too many followers"
"3928020","3928460"," on Twitter."
"3929160","3933020"," And I see so many fucking 2020 hindsight traders. "
"3933780","3937860"," Or they don't tell you when they lose or they only get snarky."
"3938400","3941320"," They only tell you afterwards, you know, yaka yaka yaka."
"3941520","3946000"," He lost all this kind of shit that isn't really relevant to the now. "
"3946520","3949100"," And so for me personally, I've paid for subscriptions."
"3950020","3951820"," I've paid for every fucking flow service."
"3951900","3953800"," I've paid for every fucking new squawk. "
"3954040","3955000"," I've paid for everything."
"3955460","3956380"," I've paid for it all."
"3957060","3957980"," I've paid for mentors. "
"3958520","3961020"," I've paid for all kinds of stupid shit."
"3961320","3962740"," And I got so pissed off on Twitter."
"3963540","3965680"," That it come from Wall Street Bets and Vegas Bets. "
"3965840","3966700"," I was like, you don't fuck this."
"3966960","3968220"," I'm like, I'm going to fucking do a live stream."
"3968920","3970120"," And we'll just do a live. "
"3970760","3972600"," Just like old school, whatever his name says."
"3973280","3974360"," No, it's fucking trade live."
"3974580","3974940"," And we'll fucking. "
"3975880","3977160"," We'll fucking see what's up."
"3977620","3980080"," Because I don't believe half the fucking people on Twitter."
"3981400","3984000"," I don't believe half the fucking people that make videos on fucking YouTube. "
"3984760","3986200"," I don't fucking believe half of them."
"3987660","3988600"," I don't fucking believe."
"3989480","3991900"," I think a ton of these people, this is their job. "
"3992740","3993380"," That's what they do."
"3993980","3994560"," They make videos."
"3995200","3996840"," So I don't give a fine fuck. "
"3996980","3997620"," We got a hundred people."
"3997860","3998340"," I'm going to find a fuck."
"3998420","3999040"," We have five people. "
"3999940","4000940"," We could stop tomorrow."
"4002040","4004880"," And I know I've got a crew of like 25 guys."
"4005300","4005940"," We could just talk. "
"4007780","4008680"," And trade together."
"4009300","4010600"," And tell us we suck too."
"4010700","4011040"," When I'm wrong. "
"4011620","4012680"," Even before we make the trade."
"4013580","4016000"," You guys have heard me many times say I haven't considered that."
"4016360","4016960"," Or you're right. "
"4018140","4019880"," And I want you guys to all be like that."
"4020020","4020780"," We're not fighting each other."
"4020880","4021380"," We're fighting banks. "
"4022940","4023580"," Be a bull."
"4023780","4024100"," Be a bear."
"4024480","4026660"," If you're only a bull, then don't take the trade. "
"4027540","4030080"," But at the same time, nobody here should be trying to fuck each other over."
"4030640","4032840"," Nobody here should be trying to be snarky."
"4033100","4033840"," Or you can get snarky. "
"4033840","4034680"," Everyone gets salty."
"4034680","4035000"," Whatever."
"4035140","4035380"," It's fine. "
"4035940","4036820"," Stress happens."
"4037720","4042480"," But if you're like the king troll on the bridge down the discord."
"4043480","4044560"," That would piss me off. "
"4044700","4045420"," I've been in those discord."
"4045780","4048180"," I've been in like the fucking trade rooms."
"4049520","4050540"," And it didn't matter. "
"4050720","4052800"," And I don't want to be a part of that shit anymore ever again."
"4056050","4057050"," I'm here to make money."
"4057710","4059130"," That's the most bizarre thing, right?"
"4059430","4060410"," He's gone really quiet. "
"4060570","4062590"," John, because he's getting chemo supposedly."
"4062590","4066910"," Someone key to send these getting chemo right now."
"4068870","4070590"," So, you know, it's not about that. "
"4070730","4072450"," You know what the craziest part of Twitter too is?"
"4073090","4075950"," You make a post on Twitter and then, you know, the end of the fucking day."
"4076250","4077450"," Some guys talking shit to you."
"4077670","4078450"," Some guys doing this. "
"4078630","4079290"," Some guys doing that."
"4079650","4081910"," You know what the craziest fucking part is?"
"4082450","4083610"," At the end of the fucking day."
"4083810","4084730"," You know what the thing that matters is?"
"4085330","4086650"," That you fucking won your trade. "
"4087550","4088050"," That's it."
"4089670","4090970"," You paid your electric bills."
"4091610","4093610"," You put money towards your retirement. "
"4094250","4095410"," You paid your mortgage."
"4096510","4097470"," That's all that matters."
"4098590","4099490"," All the snark. "
"4100109","4102290"," They just corded all the fucking snark on Twitter."
"4102870","4104490"," All the fucking snark on Wall Street Bats."
"4104970","4105609"," No, that shit matters. "
"4106450","4107090"," End of the fucking day."
"4108029","4109109"," End of the fucking day."
"4109250","4112810"," Although in your mind, you're like, oh, that tears me up. "
"4112990","4114250"," All that pisses me off."
"4115050","4119310"," The only thing that really fucking matters is that you're winning enough that you're making a"
"4119310","4119630"," profit."
"4119630","4121590"," That you're paying for this pain for that. "
"4121850","4123130"," Nobody can take that away from you."
"4123590","4124950"," I'm not some guy in your house."
"4126029","4126750"," Wherever you live. "
"4126950","4127750"," I don't care if you live alone."
"4128069","4130090"," I don't care if you're smoking pot in a fucking back bedroom."
"4130490","4132270"," I don't give a fine fuck to get a wife for kids. "
"4132710","4136090"," I don't give a fine fuck if you're a man in relationship with another man."
"4136229","4137029"," I don't care what you're doing."
"4138029","4140170"," I know that you think that I care what you're doing. "
"4140390","4143229"," I know that I care about what I think you think I'm doing."
"4143609","4144870"," But in the reality of the fucking day."
"4145510","4147590"," You know, you guys think you're like burning a bear. "
"4147810","4148330"," You're burnable."
"4148810","4150930"," The only person fucking burning you is a bank."
"4152130","4156529"," You know, once you start learning that, once you start learning that times have changed and you"
"4156529","4161970"," have to decide about your future, once you start learning that as a retail trader, you have to be"
"4161970","4163930"," in a team of people. "
"4164470","4165830"," They're going to make money together."
"4168510","4169689"," That that's what's important."
"4171189","4173770"," You don't want to hear the cacophony of fucking noise in the market. "
"4173810","4175569"," You don't want to hear the fucking cacophony of this or that."
"4175569","4179410"," You want to bring the tool that you have to the table or bring the information that you have to"
"4179410","4181609"," the table and you want to enlighten us."
"4181750","4182390"," I want to enlighten you. "
"4182529","4184649"," We need to make money together."
"4185310","4186850"," It was in the fucking day, right?"
"4187390","4192470"," When I pay my fucking electric bill and you pay your fucking electric bill, I'll fucking high five"
"4192470","4194830"," you and you'll fucking high five, no matter what was said."
"4198460","4199860"," Yeah, no cap on that bullshit. "
"4199860","4200620"," Right, hard run."
"4201160","4203340"," In the fucking day, it's the money."
"4206430","4207270"," And that's the truth. "
"4208590","4209730"," That's the fucking truth."

"4215250","4216490"," friends and all that kind of shit."
"4216690","4219990"," But I don't introduce you to them and you don't introduce me to them. "
"4220170","4223950"," And I know for a fucking fact that I trust you guys more than I trust my friends and my"
"4223950","4225210"," girlfriends and my boyfriends."
"4225550","4226610"," Because we're here to make each other money."
"4227370","4228130"," That's what we're here doing. "
"4229310","4231010"," And that's the fucking thing we're doing."
"4231270","4232070"," I don't know what else to say."
"4232390","4233810"," It's not me getting snarky with you. "
"4234490","4236070"," I don't want you getting snarky with me."
"4236790","4238270"," You know, we're here to make each other money."

"4239530","4240490"," I get to get a haircut."
"4240910","4241850"," We don't talk about this."
"4241950","4242470"," This is our circle. "
"4242710","4243350"," This is our friendship."
"4243950","4244910"," And it's important."
"4245650","4249470"," You know, at the end of the fucking day, it means more it be, you know, if I take care"
"4249470","4252770"," of myself, right, I can take care of my wife and my kids, my friends. "

"4273270","4277470"," And someone trying to pump Peton remurge spread in Twitter."
"4278090","4279330"," Apple's considered buying Peton. "
"4280050","4282550"," Yeah, Peton is definitely open to be bought."
"4283490","4284690"," Probably will get bought."
"4286010","4287830"," It won't go to just like Nicholas. "
"4287830","4290930"," Someone earlier said Peton badge will be worth something."
"4291910","4292890"," More than likely."
"4294190","4294630"," Yeah. "
"4294770","4301050"," The video last night, dude, when I made that video last night, I was spooked."
"4302770","4304950"," I made that video and I was paranoid this morning."
"4305110","4306890"," I was like, I sounded like a Raven fucking lunatic. "
"4307430","4317210"," But I made that fucking video because I owe you guys a responsibility to tell you guys the"
"4317210","4318190"," reality of the situation."
"4321100","4321320"," I do."
"4324120","4325500"," I have a responsibility, guys. "
"4325800","4326860"," I can't fuck around."
"4327060","4328180"," I can't be in my head."
"4328340","4329060"," I can't fucking. "
"4329340","4331940"," I didn't want to make the video last night either."
"4333780","4336020"," I did not want to make that video last night."
"4336760","4340940"," And after I made it, I was like, did I make a mistake making that video?"
"4341600","4342460"," I didn't. "
"4343660","4345140"," That was legit shit."
"4345320","4347640"," It went against everything in my brain, everything in my heart."
"4348380","4350920"," I had to make that fucking video because that's how you trade. "
"4351560","4353140"," You trade when you're like doing shit."
"4353260","4353960"," You don't want to do it."
"4353960","4355160"," It's like against the grain, right?"
"4356040","4357500"," Always against the fucking grain. "
"4357680","4358060"," It sucks."
"4358700","4359940"," But that is what it is."
"4361640","4362080"," Yeah. "
"4362180","4362640"," Mr. Yena."
"4363200","4368000"," I'm actually grateful that Mr. Yena is getting some chemo because he was trying some experimental"
"4368000","4368700"," stuff."
"4369340","4370220"," Oh shit. "
"4372540","4374040"," Is that really Tesla Wolf?"
"4376680","4377880"," You got to be kidding me."
"4379680","4381360"," Is that really Tesla Wolf in here?"
"4388020","4392060"," If that really is Tesla Wolf, my mind is blown."
"4393300","4394320"," You guys want to know an OG?"
"4396760","4397900"," Tesla Wolf is an OG. "

"4420080","4421600"," Holy shit, it is him."
"4423360","4424820"," You want to know a guy I want to interview?"
"4425780","4426400"," Tesla Wolf."

"4432560","4433000"," 100%."
"4434880","4436260"," I can't believe it's here."
"4436580","4439640"," Follow that guy since I first got on Twitter. "
"4440480","4441040"," You know what?"
"4441260","4442340"," He ripped into me one day."
"4443860","4445680"," Broke my dick had half one day."
"4446760","4448120"," Good to see you, Tesla Wolf. "
"4450260","4451140"," Wonderful man."
"4451680","4452900"," Knows what he's talking about."
"4453700","4457380"," He has to teach me how to do better video production. "
"4458360","4461880"," He's like a photographer, works for Hollywood and stuff."
"4462040","4462800"," That's big-time productions."
"4464440","4466480"," You want to follow somebody who knows how to invest?"
"4467140","4472380"," I keep talking to you guys about how to invest probably how to buy stocks, how to manage stocks,"
"4472680","4475460"," how to sell stocks, how long do you hold, why are you holding?"
"4476380","4481900"," He's the guy that knows what to get into, when to get into him, how to manage a portfolio, how"
"4481900","4485900"," to manage a basket of stocks, not to be trifled with. "
"4487640","4490140"," Is that is that Tesla Wolf, I believe?"
"4490560","4492880"," I think it's the spells Tesla wears."
"4492900","4494860"," He's got W-L-F-E."
"4497960","4498860"," Yeah, he's a G."
"4499740","4500340"," I love him. "
"4500960","4502380"," He's part of the old school crew."
"4503320","4504000"," You know, it's funny."
"4504140","4505580"," It was because how today went, right?"
"4506620","4509740"," So how today in the past weeks gone into December?"
"4512240","4518140"," How everything happened happened in Tesla this summer?"
"4518980","4528060"," You know, Jeremy Judkins, Tesla Wolf, me, Joe Donut, Tesla, Jess, it was like a core group of us"
"4528060","4534000"," and we saw the turn in Tesla and nobody was there with us. "
"4534740","4539720"," We had Tesla bulls telling us the same shit we were here in today about it going down."
"4539720","4540960"," Right on the opposite side."
"4542320","4543720"," They were all against us. "
"4543960","4546180"," We were the only ones who was a very small group."
"4546300","4549180"," We got Gary Black, Ben Mee, who was wild."
"4550260","4558480"," And then when Tesla was at the top, our Twitter was like, I'll go sending me people. "
"4558860","4560500"," It was really bizarre, the whole entire thing."
"4560900","4561840"," And he's stuck with me."
"4562560","4565160"," Yeah, he is a farmer, burns in tractors, baby. "
"4565160","4569820"," And he's a, yeah, and it is, that is his, uh, Andy, you're right."
"4569980","4571300"," It's at Brian Griffo."
"4571580","4572340"," You are correct. "
"4572680","4582080"," Now I remember he lives now in Colorado with high planes, drifter, beautiful sunsets, low in grass,"
"4582920","4584380"," sky is an upside down ocean."
"4585900","4587440"," Oh, yeah, I get, yeah, of course."
"4588320","4592220"," Um, still friends that saw your merit, you know, sir, in our talk, like, it's really cool. "
"4592220","4594020"," It's like this inside group of people."
"4594580","4597280"," Um, but at the same time, you don't like each other."
"4597280","4598980"," You know, I've had people say he's just a trader. "
"4599220","4601620"," I'm a fucking Tesla bull that threw him through."
"4602100","4603420"," Uh, but I, I talked truth."
"4603600","4605100"," You know, Brian talks the truth. "
"4605860","4610240"," Um, you know, people have different stages in their investing career."
"4610500","4613980"," They're different stages on how they trade and stuff like that."
"4614320","4618140"," You guys make sure you follow Brian Griffo all day long. "
"4618480","4621000"," So we're going to end this podcast and we're going to leave this here tonight."
"4621000","4625140"," I'm not going to show you guys anything else, but, uh, Brian, go back and watch from the beginning."
"4625700","4626360"," Uh, it's important. "
"4627240","4633500"," I want you guys to know that there should be some sideways movement as the banks do their thing."
"4637020","4637780"," Yeah, we block."
"4638020","4642520"," I think, uh, Gem, Gem, uh, came to my feed once and started talking shit to me. "
"4642600","4647400"," It told me to bag a dick, not bag of dicks, but Gem, Gem blocked me and then I blocked"
"4647400","4647720"," him."
"4648720","4649640"," There are a bunch of guys out there."
"4650140","4651960"," They're all great guys, smart guys. "
"4652460","4661020"," But I don't, I don't like some people that have different trading, uh, or investing, um, goals than"
"4661020","4661520"," you do."
"4662900","4664640"," Then you give them a hundred thousand followers."
"4665500","4667340"," You know, there are a million followers. "
"4668380","4673140"," And, uh, well, it's okay that you give a million followers, but a lot of you guys out there, you"
"4673140","4678420"," follow some people out there and you think that their goals are yours and they're not."
"4678720","4679800"," Everybody has different goals."
"4680440","4681840"," Everybody has what they want to do. "
"4682740","4687700"," And new traders, new investors get sucked into, well, that guy's got a hundred thousand fucking"
"4687700","4687880"," falls."
"4688140","4690860"," So he must be what I'm looking for."
"4691140","4694940"," You are looking for that guy, but your trading plan is different than his. "
"4695300","4696820"," Your investing plan is different than his."
"4698340","4699720"," Some guys are honest about it."
"4699780","4702080"," Some guys aren't or some guys have just sort of the time. "
"4703540","4706840"," To tell you that yours is different than mine."
"4708700","4709660"," Brian Griffo."
"4711300","4714540"," I think he's got a newsletter and I think he's got a whole thing like a whole. "
"4714720","4717800"," So follow him, uh, dig deep into Brian Griffo."
"4718260","4720580"," Uh, he is a man that's very intelligent."
"4721600","4724640"," Uh, yes, follow him. "
"4728710","4729570"," Is that Jeremy?"
"4731670","4733290"," Is that which Jeremy is that?"
"4733470","4734470"," Is that Jeremy from Tesla?"
"4735770","4737070"," That'd be crazy if it was."
"4738370","4739490"," Anyways, I gotta go."
"4740390","4742070"," Uh, I think some of you guys have tipped. "
"4742590","4743250"," You don't have to."
"4744190","4745450"," You did, didn't you?"
"4746210","4747870"," Uh, I want you guys to know something, okay?"
"4748350","4751890"," I want you guys, uh, Jill just tipped."

"4785210","4790010"," You saw both times we had sideways and then a rip higher on two opexes. "
"4791810","4793970"," On huge capitulation moves."
"4795490","4796390"," Right on, Alex."
"4796870","4797650"," Definitely no cap. "
"4797850","4798470"," No fucking around."
"4799290","4800310"," Uh, Ben Godfrey."
"4801090","4802250"," Thanks for sticking around. "
"4802910","4804730"," I have not had time Ben to talk."
"4805430","4810890"," Um, but I want you guys to realize that as we get into tomorrow, the banks have to do their"
"4810890","4811090"," work."
"4811830","4813790"," There might be some capitulation and open. "
"4814210","4816390"," I want you to realize they're gonna burn down."
"4817150","4819790"," Uh, the market makers, they're gonna say thank you for playing."
"4824570","4829630"," I want you to realize that even if we're going down later, there might be a van at there. "
"4829630","4830970"," They're going to say it's a van at trade."
"4831750","4834350"," The van at rally right now is not going to be the van at rally."
"4834750","4838730"," Almost promise you the ones that you expect in a bull market. "
"4839050","4841010"," We're in bull town or bear town."
"4841190","4846050"," So in bear town, your van at rally is not the fucking van at rally in bull town."
"4851400","4852480"," I smell blood too. "
"4853160","4854700"," I'm not saying we're not going down."
"4855580","4857040"," But we're going down with a fight."
"4857260","4859640"," We're definitely going down with banks. "
"4860540","4862120"," Not getting fucked as they go down."
"4862400","4869040"," So if bank got caught in here, they will, they will spend some money to unfuck themselves as we get"
"4869040","4869200"," out."
"4871830","4872970"," Yeah, good to see you, Emerson. "
"4873930","4875970"," Emerson, I want to interview you at some point too."
"4876150","4877150"," Like Emerson's on the list."
"4877990","4879290"," Not even interview, just like talk. "
"4882410","4884030"," So that's all I got to say for tonight."
"4884450","4885850"," You guys made bank today."
"4886330","4887690"," Michelle, thanks for subscribing. "
"4888470","4892970"," If you guys didn't make bank today, I hope that you didn't lose your asses today."
"4893330","4898590"," I'll tell you what, there were some investors and traders this past month and this past week."
"4899150","4902410"," I mean, we made money on the way down the way up the way down the way up the way"
"4902410","4902970"," way down. "
"4904710","4909170"," But you know that there are people today that there's meetings tonight and the overnight."
"4912010","4916110"," No, I don't think that, to me personally, I don't think that the stock market is fucked all year."
"4916930","4918450"," Well, we've talked about that in the past. "
"4922350","4924050"," We've talked about is the market fucked."
"4924490","4925350"," I don't think that it's fucked."
"4927590","4928630"," Thanks, yields to the moon. "
"4929470","4930350"," I don't think we're fucked."
"4930570","4934530"," I think that banks saying you're going to make 9% this year that you have to start from a"
"4934530","4935090"," certain point."
"4935530","4941110"," I think if you look back in the last 20 years or more, when you go back to 1986, 1987,"
"4941350","4948490"," on years like this, there's a there's like the what normally happens, a little bit of what happens"
"4948490","4949890"," in the few outliers. "
"4950310","4956970"," And outside of us selling down for an entire year, which is a huge outlier, we should trade down to"
"4956970","4963190"," a bottom defined bottom that looks like the banks are trying to price in before the Fed so that"
"4963190","4969790"," even if we trade up this year, or let's say 9%, or 6%, or even minus 9%, or at least"
"4969790","4975690"," going to have a fucking bottom, that we can trade up four sideways up down to find trading space."
"4976610","4981330"," Now, if you're in the camp of market crash, there are ways for you to hedge that."
"4981970","4983010"," We've talked about it on Twitter. "
"4983650","4984590"," We've talked about it on these videos."
"4985410","4986870"," It's called a putback spread."
"4987570","4988430"," It's very simple. "
"4988870","4989910"," You don't have to trade vol."
"4990410","4992910"," You don't have to take a dumbbell."
"4993990","4995150"," They call me not dumbbell. "
"4995230","4998230"," They're called barbell trades."
"4998290","4999190"," I think they're called."
"5000510","5002150"," You don't have to take put spreads. "
"5002870","5004310"," You can take a putback spread."
"5005070","5006230"," It'll actually pay you."
"5006310","5008350"," It'll actually break even pay you. "
"5009470","5013270"," Even if it goes up or it'll print heavy."
"5013850","5017190"," So if you're in the market crash camp, that's fine."
"5017790","5020030"," Just go hedge yourself like that, right?"
"5020350","5021670"," And stop saying market crash. "
"5022130","5023450"," And trade the markets in front of you."
"5023770","5024830"," Get yourself the hedge."
"5025590","5035950"," You can pull putback spreads for $4.28, $4.06, $3.65, $3 "
"5035950","5041290",".28. You can pull one for $1.65. Every three months you can do it. "
"5041290","5043910"," And they don't even cost you any money to break even."
"5045070","5048690"," And then trade the market to the right of you while you're doing that."
"5052990","5053710"," Thank you. "
"5053870","5054870"," Thank all you guys out there."
"5055090","5058190"," Chase is saying thing is Apple is barely down."
"5058590","5060510"," That's a very complex situation. "
"5063300","5069740"," Yeah, a gem did post something regarding gem, spot, gamma, all those guys."
"5070020","5072540"," You know, those guys are all great."
"5072540","5075120"," And they're all positive, but let's talk about something real. "
"5077300","5079600"," Let's talk about something real within the fucking day."
"5081640","5086720"," Nobody has given you the play by play minute by minute."
"5087380","5088480"," How we make moves. "
"5088860","5092160"," And that's the key difference between paying a thousand bucks for a private sub."
"5092760","5097100"," And you and I sit in here trading together day in day out."
"5097540","5101220"," So if we see the market move down or up, make a shift. "
"5101220","5102460"," Go the other way."
"5104420","5106140"," Who's who you guys paying for that?"
"5106220","5107220"," I didn't know that chain happened."
"5107460","5108440"," They used to pay for it. "
"5109620","5110360"," It's rare."
"5111680","5112160"," Rare."
"5113760","5115340"," We're trading together with like this. "
"5115780","5116500"," I know it's rare."
"5117020","5117520"," A hundred percent."
"5119520","5123000"," You know, I think holding puts so close is fine. "
"5124320","5127120"," But you know, it's rare."
"5128020","5128760"," We're trading together."
"5128760","5130660"," And so I like trading with you guys. "
"5130860","5132260"," I've seen all you guys out there."
"5132360","5133120"," Good morning, Bill."
"5133520","5134660"," How's your dog doing?"
"5136500","5137300"," Alfie's listening. "
"5137640","5138580"," Hello, Alfie."
"5144160","5145160"," Good to see you, Bill."
"5146840","5149220"," Bill, how's it going in the UK right now?"
"5149420","5151240"," Are you guys worried about Ukraine?"
"5152060","5153420"," Are you guys got soldiers over there?"
"5154560","5156060"," Canada's got soldiers over there now. "
"5156320","5156620"," Your partner."
"5163190","5164290"," I love all you guys."
"5166170","5166950"," Absolutely, John. "
"5167150","5167510"," You know this."

"5169190","5169750"," Good to see you. "
"5170990","5172090"," Have a great night, everybody."
"5174810","5176350"," Alex is like I paid for a sub."
"5176490","5177630"," He's buying dips every day. "
"5178250","5179610"," And I feel bad for him."
"5181650","5182810"," I used to pay for subs."
"5183050","5183970"," I used to pay a lot of money for subs. "
"5184670","5189010"," I've been in like deep dark basement fucking trading groups, trading rooms."
"5190210","5191110"," He looked around."
"5192810","5193810"," Hello, good boy. "
"5196950","5197790"," Hello, handsome."
"5199210","5200510"," I've got two dogs, Bill."
"5201210","5203150"," Oh, you know, I met Bill a year ago. "
"5203610","5207930"," And Bill just post a picture of his dog every night like late morning and it made my whole entire"
"5207930","5208270"," day."
"5209930","5211350"," We're talking about too much."

"5239230","5240010"," into Monday."

"5246510","5250370"," We're going to also look for some squeeze plays into Friday, Monday, Tuesday. "
"5251070","5255550"," And we're going to take a look for where the trading range is for the next month."
"5255550","5258370"," And we're going to look forward to the Fed, right?"
"5259750","5260490"," Yeah, Bill."
"5261690","5263370"," Nothing like a dog or kids. "
