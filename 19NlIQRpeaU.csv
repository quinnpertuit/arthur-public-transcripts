"3560100","3562800"," into the inhibition zone Do you want to continue to talk about that one?"
"3563460","3572360"," Yes, so the goal of meme stock watch The reason why I was created is because I Being around uh"
"3572360","3577480"," the meme stock world for the past three years been there since pretty much the beginning Um, I do"
"3577480","3584940"," know that unfortunately a lot of retail investors have lost large sums of money small sums of money"
"3584940","3592500"," on options and um With with uh the deep dive stocks data that you're familiar with now that I've"
"3592500","3595840"," been using for a long time That some people on the stream may have heard of may have not heard"
"3595840","3602680"," of Um, I've personally never seen anything as good at it as it when it comes to predicting Upside"
"3602680","3609140"," or downside and it just such a super helpful indicator because um One certain things happen like in"
"3609140","3615380"," this case it was vox moving into the inhibition zone which may sound uh a little confusing but The"
"3615380","3625120"," summary is just um, you know based on Volatility exposure Um, once vox which"
"3625120","3630380"," literally stands for volatility volatility exposure moves into the inhibition zone Which is the"
"3630380","3635900"," upper black line once the pink line moves above there That is bullish and price will proceed to"
"3635900","3641200"," rise until vox moves out of the inhibition zone And when vox moves into the propagation zone, which"
"3641200","3647200"," is under the lower black line that is bearish and it means the stock is lacking stability If you're"
"3647200","3651840"," looking at the chart right now, you can see that huge spike down deep into the propagation zone"
"3651840","3657640"," That was about oh five Uh, january for every march april may so in the beginning of the may there"
"3657640","3662400"," was a huge spike down and that's where amc Just got relentlessly pummeled for months all the way up"
"3662400","3669100"," until the split in five days ago books You could see on the chart poked spiking higher now Yeah,"
"3669100","3675800"," and so um with meme stock watch like we don't Play calls on on these stocks unless we're doing a"
"3675800","3680820"," short little scout unless vox moves into the inhibition zone and on the chart Highlighted all the"
"3680820","3685960"," way to the left of the screen showcases the last time That vox moved into the inhibition zone frame"
"3685960","3691780"," c where you can see a huge upside reaction So about five days ago gave up the message on meme"
"3691780","3697660"," stock watch um which again, we made it really cheap and accessible to retail traders by keeping it"
"3697660","3703820"," only $20 a month and Send out the message like it's time to go along the name c because vox"
"3703820","3708260"," is now in the inhibition zone We expect a sharp rise in price and that that's why i put out"
"3708260","3712800"," this week So i was like look like for those of you that enjoy playing upside in amc like here's"
"3712800","3718800"," the warning upside is coming Um and sure enough we went long at about eight ten and the target was"
"3718800","3723340"," mid tens It was the daily triggers if you want to pull up amc you can see where the daily"
"3723340","3725520"," trigger was Pulling up right now brother. "
"3725520","3730720"," I'm on it right now for you I highlighted those two zones where uh you had the bloodbath and then"
"3730720","3747550"," where you started to break above with box Hold on we got this um So amc So"
"3747550","3749830"," I don't think uh the upside is over."
"3750330","3755270"," I think price will continue moving higher up towards the daily trigger So i got the daily trigger"
"3755270","3760690"," at 11 21 right now, but roughly right around there you think we can still go up there and slam"
"3760690","3761970"," into that daily trigger, right?"
"3762490","3763410"," Yes, I do."
"3763650","3767810"," I wouldn't enter here Because I got in two dollars cheaper. "
"3768530","3773570"," Um, I never like to enter you know after a big move But unless you want to use the five"
"3773570","3778750"," minute trigger as a stop loss, you can take a low risk High reward trade, but I do believe price"
"3778750","3786130"," will we'll head up to 11 to about 11 or so Um, yeah, do you think that entire glass do"
"3786130","3793010"," you think the do you think the entire um Move can be retraced to that 13 27ish or so or"
"3793570","3798390"," It's possible if price breaks above the daily trigger I expect continued upside as long as vox"
"3798390","3803890"," remains in the inhibition zone so every night Um and looks like amc can actually get a pop here Um,"
"3804050","3807710"," but every night i'll just be checking the data and as long as vox remains in the inhibition zone"
"3807710","3814170"," further upside is expected until we see a really large spike in box which indicates that the latest"
"3814170","3822410"," price action has destabilized itself meaning it provoked massive instability in the markets And if"

"3826950","3832970"," likely over and be cautious for downside coming But for now as amc moves up as vox continues into"
"3832970","3837290"," the inhibition zone There's really no need for concern of bearishness Uh, things look like they'll"
"3837290","3842390"," continue moving upward at least towards the daily trigger If price breaks above that the hourly"
"3842390","3848590"," trigger crosses above we could be talking about a monster move Monster move up to the weekly"
"3848590","3852130"," trigger at 28 or so But yeah, it's much higher, isn't it?"
"3852530","3858810"," So are you talking about a life changer and Honestly, I'm really excited for the meme stock watch"
"3858810","3863930"," guys if that move would happen because you you know How much money you can make on a move like"
"3863930","3864170"," that?"
"3864850","3866650"," From 12 to 28."
"3866950","3871650"," Yeah, yeah, I've got it right now at 30 bucks So uh you figure 28 by the time you get"
"3871650","3877170"," there somewhere right around there right on the week or two You could be easily at 28 25 $3 Yeah,"
"3877710","3881570"," I mean if vox continues to push into the inhibition zone and the hourly trigger crosses above the"
"3881570","3887270"," daily trigger Then it's a low risk high reward set up with a stop loss below the daily trigger And"
"3887270","3893210"," just calls three months out or so and just sit on them Um until anything in the data changes or"
"3893210","3898190"," until price breaks below the daily trigger And you have to exit the position for a small loss In in"
"3898190","3904910"," comparison to the possible huge gains if the move completes itself But again right now it's still"
"3904910","3909610"," early prices still below the daily trigger I wouldn't want to jump ahead of anything, but you got"
"3909610","3915550"," work We got work to do an amc on that daily trigger and then price battling that and consolidating"
"3915550","3921510"," on it and Exactly, but from there listen it could take a couple weeks till till that point happens"
"3921510","3926810"," But if there's an hourly trigger daily trigger cross an amc Um if you go back on the amc chart"
"3927390","3932350"," Uh all the way back you'll notice that hourly trigger daily trigger crosses are really strong If"
"3932350","3938870"," you want to show I'm going to show them right now Barish and bullish so you can show the bearish"
"3938870","3944430"," cross that led to all this downside in the first place Um and you can show the bullish crosses"
"3944430","3952970"," which have always been the Through requisite to amc moving much higher Let me see if I can um, it's"
"3952970","3956890"," hard for me to show amc without I don't have a pulse."
"3957090","3958090"," Well, maybe I do hold on here. "
"3958190","3965840"," Let me just uh go over that one more time Uh hold on one second here Uh hold on here"
"3970840","3981570"," You got to switch this back here Uh think that one right there So"
"3981570","3993360"," i've got you off screen right now, but we're going to talk about So we're"
"3993360","4001620"," going to talk about uh, what happens When you get these big spikes i've got them on the hourly"
"4001620","4009780"," chart right now Or it goes straight to the moon and the the implication here would be that you"
"4009780","4015520"," would get Uh this consolidated move break above the daily trigger slam up into this weekly"
"4016920","4022380"," Consolidate inside of air and then make a move up to uh, that's six actually the monthly trigger is"
"4022380","4027700"," 63 79 Uh, so that's 60 bucks right there."
"4027780","4031760"," So forget even the $28 you could be doubling that to 60, right?"
"4032320","4042100"," How about that daily"
"4042100","4047880"," trigger sitting there at 11, whatever it is Um, if price gets above that an hourly trigger cross is"
"4047880","4054900"," more all odds favor a tremendous upside move Um, that will probably bring a lot of retail back into"
"4054900","4059920"," the markets if I have to guess Could also spark a lot of things moving in meme world like i'll"
"4059920","4065120"," be honest with you Um, this is one of the main things i'm currently watching Um, I took my profits"
"4065120","4068000"," from the amc run already, uh mean more than enough."
"4068060","4073100"," I try not to be greedy and Wait for price to get all the way to my target Um, but"
"4073100","4077000"," if price breaks above the daily trigger and that hourly trigger cross is uh, we can see something"
"4077000","4081940"," special Happen for sure something that we haven't seen in the in at least the year in amc a real"
"4081940","4087840"," move to the upside Uh that do you do you think um, do you think like $30 See three months"
"4087840","4088120"," out?"
"4088320","4089180"," What do you think in 28?"
"4089440","4091500"," Dollar sees three months out six months out. "
"4091500","4099279"," I would only start working on my next position once Uh once those triggers cross, but how I would"
"4099279","4105240"," play it is I would go I'd go three months out and I would probably go Uh probably a ladder"
"4105240","4110660"," with the concentration of my calls half the distance between price and target Yeah, uh surprise"
"4110660","4116520"," that that one would be about 1150 target would be about 28 Let's say 25 just to be you know,"
"4116520","4122420"," a little more fair Um, so I would take about like 16 $17 strike and then I would also ladder"
"4122420","4127960"," some like 20s And I would also take some closer in the money calls where as soon as the move"
"4127960","4132720"," starts What I would do is right after the trigger cross what I always love to do is I like"
"4132720","4138680"," to send 75% of my capital Into longer dated calls three months out, but I always love to have"
"4138680","4144040"," 25% in shorter dated So that if i'm right not just about the move, but also about the timing"
"4144040","4150359"," of the move I have the ability to sell my shorter dated calls People to profit and pay for my"
"4150359","4155460"," entire longer dated position, which I can now sit on for free So there's two ways to win of"
"4155460","4156180"," options, right?"
"4156359","4160859"," You have to be right about direction, but you also have to be right about the timing Now triggers"
"4160859","4167700"," and you know the box which are used make timing a lot easier Um, but of course when you play"
"4167700","4172180"," around with large amounts of money You always want that safety of having a larger dated position"
"4172180","4178160"," But with the ability to also catch moves in the short term by having access to triggers and box"
"4178160","4182979"," With the ability to know that price is likely to move much higher in the very very short term I"

"4788240","4795020"," you talk about how you're entering trades And uh, once we start to Consolidate sideways and"
"4795020","4800780"," rechecking the one in five minutes That you're pulling off percentages of your lungs or shorts and"
"4800780","4807440"," only leaving a few runners on Do you want to go through that talk real quick or Yeah, so I"
"4807440","4809060"," use a very simple system."
"4809140","4815940"," Um, depending on the time frame of my calls is which trigger i'll stop out under So for example spy"
"4815940","4821160"," today wrote up the woman and trigger most of the day Um, and I'll also be watching for divergences"
"4821740","4826420"," But if i'm in weeklies and I see price break below the woman and trigger Even if I think there's"
"4826420","4831540"," a great chance that i'll catch support on the five minute trigger I'm not willing to sit in those"
"4831540","4836140"," calls knowing that okay price is more than likely going to come down To the five minute trigger"
"4836140","4838140"," now, which can be 20 cents below price. "
"4838360","4843080"," It could be 40 cents below price It's not something i'm willing to sit through and so by me when"
"4843080","4847060"," i'm at whatever i'm playing We can cause i like to be long above the woman and trigger But once"
"4847060","4851600"," that breakdown happens, that's when I quickly exit the trade When i'm trading a little longer dated"
"4851600","4856460"," two weeks out monthly contracts Then i'll use the five minute trigger as a stop loss if price"
"4856460","4859520"," breaks below the five minute trigger i'll be out of the trade But i'm not too concerned with the"
"4859520","4864700"," one minute trigger because again I'm looking for a trending move over the coming days over the"
"4864700","4870160"," coming weeks, which is why i went further out And I and as long as hourly velocity looks good as"
"4870160","4873440"," long as five into velocity looks good I assume the five and the trigger is going to continue"

"5941180","5944520"," I'm not going to give some numbers I'm going to give you how about end of the year price targets"
"5944520","5950280"," and then I got a second follow-up question I do think we are per I think we're very bullish."
"5950480","5955440"," I think we're going to I think we're going a lot higher to be on it. "
"5955460","5965420"," Okay, okay And this But personal"
"5965420","5969180"," opinion I do think yeah, you're allowed to change like you're allowed to change based upon the day"
"5969980","5974460"," Positioning the orientation like with the with the weekly trigger is stacked in top of the monthly"
"5974460","5982440"," trigger dips are expected to be bought until they're a Buarish Muncie divergence To break that"
"5982440","5988900"," monthly Yeah, it does make sense to me and then Especially if the hourly trigger now crosses above"
"5988900","5994460"," the daily trigger that will put the trend higher Again, anything can happen And I wouldn't take a"
"5994460","5995680"," bet based off this."
"5995960","6000880"," Yeah, but I would say I certainly think we added Yeah, we're just talking we're just talking like"
"6000880","6009100"," shooting the ships, you know smoking a cigar Yeah, whiskey stuff uh, so what about um I was gonna"
"6009100","6014380"," do a follow-up and say Uh, so it is for the it is to the right end up then"
"6014380","6014920"," isn't it?"
"6015640","6025200"," I hope I hope because I have a humongous GME Share position and I would love to see that Get"
"6025200","6027380"," a uplift draft with the market."
"6027660","6033460"," Um, if the market heads down to 400 It's not gonna look good for me and uh my overall portfolio. "
"6033580","6038040"," So my hope is that Um, you know, it's always nicer when the market's moving higher."
"6038340","6044080"," It's um, I'm a way better bull than I am beer I am It in fact, I would say out"
"6044080","6048520"," of all traders that are good at making profit on the upside I think i'm the worst at playing"
"6048520","6053820"," downside whenever the market has a green day For some reason my portfolio is always green may not"
"6053820","6059140"," make a ton of money that day But I'll always make money whenever the market's red Even when I know"
"6059140","6060180"," things are bearish."
"6060440","6064960"," I always find myself just trying to long Bottoms instead of shorting grips. "
"6065300","6071940"," I just long dips for no reason Even when I'm fully convinced we're bearish It's just the way I like"
"6071940","6077180"," operate like I always want to get along like I just like playing long I hate playing short So for"
"6077180","6082940"," Yeah, for my for my own sake I hope the market pushes higher because I'm a way better trader on"
"6082940","6088020"," the long side than the short side I've just I've reduced myself just being personally Like I've"
"6088020","6088820"," traded both sides."
"6089060","6089620"," I've traded the wheel."
"6089840","6094900"," I've done it all and I'm like I'm at this point where I just I like being along the market. "
"6095080","6095440"," It's easier."
"6095600","6100940"," I feel better It even helps my psychology like my son my psychology psyche Helps my head."
"6100940","6104960"," I don't know what it is about it At this point in my life. "
"6105220","6107040"," I just like owning the mark I like owning the market."
"6107040","6107920"," I like buying the market."
"6107920","6112420"," I like It just fits me at this point my career. "
"6112800","6117380"," It's not a question of do I like going short I got people ask about futures all the time and"
"6117380","6121660"," I'm like I used to just trade futures But I never had a life So I try to dump or"
"6121660","6122420"," not so much."
"6122660","6127140"," I don't trade futures as much as I used to I'll trade them here and there But And that's like"
"6127140","6132940"," I don't like doing put buying they pay they can pay really well But oftentimes they don't most of"
"6132940","6140320"," my wins are from the long Bull side of things bought being a buyer As a bull I guess Not"
"6140320","6145740"," buying puts but buying calls or buying the underlying That kind of stuff So I've kind of caught"
"6145740","6151220"," most of that out sometimes they'll still short or sell the market But I like put buying is very"
"6151220","6156560"," rare for me these days um as like trying to be a trader, but I understand people do better as"
"6156560","6164360"," a seller or as a bear or um Short the market whatever it is their their stances are I'm jealous"
"6164360","6164880"," of them."
"6164920","6166280"," Yeah, that's it. "
"6166480","6173160"," If I could just flip my charts around I I'll make money both ways But I'm limited Again, I'm not"
"6173160","6174420"," the most experienced trader."
"6174700","6178280"," I've been trading, you know Options I've really only been trading three years."
"6178640","6183380"," So I hope that as my career progresses I'll get better at trading the short side, but right now I"
"6183380","6186980"," I really have trouble trading short I hope it changes. "
"6187260","6191200"," I'm I am trying to work on it, but still a struggle for me I'd say it's the I'd say"
"6191200","6195860"," that and cutting trades too early depends if you think that's a weakness or not Are probably my two"
"6195860","6200240"," biggest weaknesses right now And I always try to you know Understand what my strengths are"
"6200240","6204600"," understand what my weaknesses are so that I could kick them apart and and try to work on the things"
"6204600","6209540"," that I'm Bad at instead of continuing to get better at the things that I'm already good at Yeah,"
"6209600","6210660"," that's good response good response."
"6210680","6211100"," Hold on."
"6211260","6218320"," Let me see what these guys are saying here Uh When I when I'm short, I find myself rooting for"
"6218320","6225280"," bad things that happens like I make a buck not fun That's how I feel the same way Yeah, I'm"
"6225280","6235000"," like I need something really bad to happen right now Yes, yeah Not good for us as humans It's like"
"6235000","6236120"," I'm short over the weekend. "
"6236120","6243980"," I hope a war breaks out You know, it's funny too is like so I was long over the weekend"
"6243980","6246920"," and I was like well We're not above the daily."
"6247160","6247820"," We're not above the weekly."
"6248160","6253040"," I'm like none of this is stable I'm like you're gonna buy some cheap ass puts for Wednesday or"
"6253040","6258620"," something They were like three cents or something, but I did it as a As a hedge in case anything"
"6258620","6263960"," happened over the weekend And over the weekend, I've got uh, I got like 300 I think I had 300"
"6263960","6272040"," puts 406 and then I got 300 call spreads for 444 15 I'm like, I'm like, well if if this"
"6272040","6277340"," happens over the weekend and we start crashing at least I got that going for me I shouldn't be"
"6277340","6280660"," thinking that What's that?"
"6281240","6287980"," I said you're probably so thankful you had that hedge over Yeah I'd be if I was naked long I"
"6287980","6291380"," mean, how many people thought I think people that were just short over the weekend must have been"
"6291380","6295860"," like we're fucked We're gonna make so much money and we kind of went down, but not really we just"
"6295860","6301680"," retested that prior low Um in pre-market and that was the signal that the buyers were still there,"
"6301900","6301960"," right?"
"6302160","6307560"," We in the pre-market that we traded for 18, 420 or something and then immediately bounced and it"
"6307560","6309360"," was like it's on They're still there. "
"6309480","6316320"," The buyers are still here in the market right now Yep, do you think that's a function of um So"
"6316320","6326140"," my positive here is or my positive Monday was Uh, the market doesn't like unknowns to itself like"
"6326140","6331160"," if they already know about something happening I usually I'll know if they know about something"
"6331160","6336740"," though, they'll ride it and be positioned for it If they're not positioned for an truly unknown"
"6336740","6344680"," action in the market Often times you'll see the initial reaction, but then the retracement Yes, and"
"6344680","6349120"," they'll follow along the path they were on Uh, impossibly hedge."
"6349580","6350900"," It's like Mondays open."
"6351120","6354280"," We I think when Monday opened what I was like Early morning. "
"6354540","6360040"," I was like, uh, I was like this looks like hedging's coming into the market Uh, it once that"
"6360040","6365780"," hedging flow is delta hedged by dealers You should see the markets spring up into the close and"
"6365780","6368160"," that's what happened Uh, we ended up stringing up in the close."
"6368360","6370820"," So that's like, yeah It's like okay."
"6370940","6376380"," They got it like they're giving you the opportunity to hedge and They're staying on path where they"
"6376380","6377240"," want to go in this market. "
"6377420","6386660"," We were way way oversold Um, and so I feel like this Monday was a prime example of Um They"
"6386660","6387840"," weren't positioned for it."
"6387900","6392580"," They want this market to at least go up enough so that they can Sell it down."
"6392900","6397600"," Uh, so it'll be a thread that oversold of conditions Uh, you're talking about an actual market"
"6397600","6402560"," crash and we weren't really ready for a market crash Uh, at that moment, right?"
"6402980","6409840"," So, um, I It just played out to me where Uh, it was fascinating to see that we didn't go"
"6409840","6415420"," down deeper on Monday, I guess Uh, and it shows it's like lifting the skirt of the banks and the"
"6415420","6416820"," banks are like, fuck you. "
"6416860","6422520"," No, we're not we're not prepared for this So we're going up the way we're originally gonna go Yes,"
"6423000","6428520"," I fully agree Yeah, I don't know if I'm wording that's too simply or whatever, but But it does beg"
"6428520","6430040"," that question that you're talking about."
"6430360","6434720"," Um, so when we get we got this bounce We're going to come back down and check the daily trigger"
"6434720","6441120"," check the hourly trigger and we're going to find out if, um If that we get that role to the"
"6441120","6444400"," downside from what happened this past weekend or not, right?"
"6444520","6451000"," Are they just Uh looking for that opportunity to exit the market and start rolling it down Uh, do"
"6451000","6453820"," you do some kind of anticipated future volatility?"
"6454300","6454580"," Do you?"
"6455640","6464280"," So when I was in the army, right Uh, some similar situations to this Um, you'd see the initial Uh"
"6465780","6471640"," retaliation, which we're seeing in Israel right now Uh, then usually bombing and then it usually"
"6471640","6479060"," takes anywhere from two weeks to nine weeks To call people back get them, uh situated, uh, hold"
"6479060","6484720"," under hold over assigned to units You got to check them medically check your IRR guys are coming"
"6484720","6489460"," back to service Make sure that they're medically fit Assign them and some of them you're going to"
"6489460","6499200"," most likely have to train up So that could take weeks I would assume here IDF is going"
"6499200","6506420"," to ramp all of that stuff up, but um Do you think that I guess the question would be have"
"6506420","6513420"," the initial volatility of the event from this past weekend Uh, do you think that that uh, that"
"6513420","6517020"," volatility is going to hang over, uh, world markets?"
"6517800","6524520"," I think it over the coming weeks Evolved and yes, and if not, then no, I think if we see"
"6525240","6530900"," Neighborhood countries, uh start to get involved and then I think things can get really bad Um, but"
"6530900","6536520"," as long as israel and hamas are fighting it out between themselves I don't think it should have"
"6536520","6542940"," such an impact on our markets I mean, how we were involvement from other countries as uh for"
"6542940","6549780"," volatility Yeah, like last night I saw even after all the news There was a huge increase in put"
"6549780","6555800"," selling on spy like that was my forecast last night like just falls just we're going up Um and and"
"6555800","6559680"," I was surprised I was like it's it's shocking to me how bullish they're positioned even with"
"6559880","6561300"," Everything that's going on."
"6561560","6562360"," They just don't care. "
"6562820","6569300"," Um, so the market's gonna go uh pretty much where they wanted to yeah and And you know, unless"
"6569300","6574320"," unless russia, I ran, um, lebanon egypt starts getting involved."
"6574740","6578660"," I I don't think it should affect much Yeah, there's no expert."
"6578960","6579980"," I'm no market expert. "
"6580200","6586540"," I'm no war expert Um, my my strengths are are trading with the triggers trading based on data, but"
"6586540","6592340"," that just wouldn't what makes sense to me Yeah, there's uh, I I haven't spoken much about it But"
"6592340","6597660"," from my perspective, I was like these people I was like they're those at this market has positioned"
"6597660","6603720"," long or at least thanks All right, we're positioned long heading into that weekend and I don't"
"6603720","6607260"," think you could I don't think I think it was like a lifting the skirt moment where they're like"
"6607260","6607680"," fuck you."
"6607780","6615840"," We're not losing this uh Yes, like How do we unwind ourselves from this uh this turn that we're"
"6615840","6620960"," anticipating Quickly and if we do unwind ourselves right where we are, what does it lead to?"
"6621480","6631280"," And it's probably leads to a sizable Fast down like 10 move or something insane Uh to the other"
"6631280","6637500"," 10 percent that we're already down 11 whatever that was that we went down Uh, let me see we let"
"6637500","6642220"," me see what people are saying in the chat one more time because we're gonna wrap up uh, let me"
"6642220","6644740"," see we can Let me see."
"6645020","6649680"," Um, let's face people are saying Uh, put her or put her me bad. "
"6650120","6652360"," Uh, what do you guys think of michael barry shirt in the market?"
"6652660","6655340"," Will options chain be overpriced for tomorrow?"
"6656340","6658020"," Uh, what else do we got here?"
"6658880","6665960"," True across uh t l t 30 minute charts like killer Iran could affect oil prices and that will drop"
"6665960","6669820"," the market oil prices rocket Uh, you've got some main ports."
"6670420","6676680"," Uh, you've got one major port Uh, near or in gaza and then you are you do have major ports"
"6676680","6680680"," for um, Do you think the tanker gang will get a lot ton of love?"
"6681260","6685440"," Like this tanker gang and get imported the most or do you think that oil prices will skyrocket?"
"6686580","6690640"," Uh, if those ports are closed to two other countries getting involved."
"6691260","6697580"," I guess it'd be Do you think that oil prices could moon go to like over a hundred bucks and"
"6697580","6698160"," all that kind of stuff?"
"6698840","6702160"," You know, there was actually what did oxie do today?"
"6702400","6705220"," I saw tons of bullish positioning on oxie yesterday. "
"6705600","6706820"," Now let's take a look at it."
"6707020","6713200"," Uh, as where they were in this, um No, it didn't move Didn't move at all, but yeah, it didn't"
"6713200","6719340"," move at all and They were a lot of sold puts on oxie yesterday I wonder if something's brewing"
"6719340","6723940"," there like sometimes it takes a couple of days to kick in because A lot of the upside that happens"
"6723940","6729560"," from these sold puts is the long delta that's given over to the deal We then have to go into"
"6729560","6731280"," the market and purchase shares the hedge."
"6731700","6736240"," Yep Um, so I wonder I wonder if if something's gonna brew with oil. "
"6736300","6742240"," That was my first thought when I saw oxie I was like, oh Someone's betting oil, but it's boiling"
"6742240","6746820"," right now Positioning as long If a move does come."
"6747260","6753320"," Yeah, if a move does come Uh for oxie over it could be a news related event that happens overnight"
"6753780","6759620"," But someone with with money with size positioned Very long in oxie yesterday."
"6759720","6763380"," Yeah, this is um, this is c l right now. "
"6763500","6770880"," This is like like crude And they're starting to break out from this Um from this bull flag right"
"6770880","6779820"," here They're like grinding sideways Uh, but still no actual move Still no actual move here."
"6779820","6789040"," So um I wondered if the I looked at Brent and cio or cia I looked at Brent and Uh"
"6789740","6792820"," C l yesterday and it looks kind of weird."
"6792840","6799880"," There was one of them was showing Let me see if they can bring up Brent It was weird like"
"6799880","6808440"," Brent was showing Yeah, Brent what Brent here had still has this daily trigger problem up here Uh,"
"6808560","6816460"," so I wondered if we got the initial squeeze Off of oil and then we rejected it's not showing it"
"6816460","6824400"," on cl this daily trigger up here, but Uh, pretend not pretend, but if you're a trading oil, just be"
"6824400","6834180"," aware of Uh If you're trading cl, I would say monitor Brent for $89 Uh, dollars"
"6834180","6840660"," And see if there's any rejection off Brent Brent can go It's own way versus cl, but I would still"
"6840660","6848160"," be interested in Whatever news pops out around um, $89 on Brent I'd be paying attention. "
"6848160","6853580"," I guess the cl in Brent at the same time That's the only insight that I have on on either"
"6853580","6856120"," of those What else do we have here?"
"6856580","6858440"," Uh caught that red candle dip or 200 bucks."

"7669840","7671920"," be in Um, sure."
"7672140","7679480"," I think he kept himself or he keeps he's keeping Uh, hold of himself at least publicly on the"
"7679480","7684580"," stream right like by being interviewed But there's no possible way that that can be an easy"
"7684580","7691220"," experience Uh for someone to have to be going through anybody to be going through right now All"
"7691220","7696520"," right, so let's go over uh, let's go over what to expect in the coming days And uh, let's take"
"7696520","7706920"," a quick look at Uh, book map So hold on here Sorry"
"7706920","7707580"," about that."
"7707780","7712900"," So uh, we're gonna take a quick look at book map and you can see here in book map That"
"7712900","7715760"," this is uh, the hourly trigger, right?"
"7715920","7721180"," You see this here So here's the hourly trigger right down here We're just kind of grinding on the"
"7721180","7727480"," hourly the daily the half hour trigger over here And we have a a larger move to the downside. "
"7727880","7740180"," So I want you to be aware of this um This demand that's much much lower here That's"
"7740180","7750160"," not at 43 62 43 62 on uh, on es down there is that next level See"
"7750160","7752640"," if we can Bring this out a little bit."
"7752720","7761460"," You kind of want to see this Not kind of you kind of need this to hold here Uh, this"
"7761460","7762160"," hourly trigger."
"7762360","7763420"," There's a little bit. "
"7763560","7770380"," There's a little bit more demand down this way here and then um As you can see that's it looks"
"7770380","7770640"," up."
"7770820","7775540"," There's another level way way way lower, but that's this is the one down here That I'd be paying"
"7775540","7782440"," attention to Let me see them raise this up a little bit here And we'll see if this if this"
"7782440","7795830"," level is going to hold here Let's keep uh That open right there Yeah, just like that We'll"
"7795830","7803430"," leave that up on our screener here to see see if this port holds Now on the trigger screen We're"
"7803430","7813260"," going to switch over to the trigger screen really quick and bowls are looking for When it bowls are"
"7813260","7818880"," looking for well, first of all you see the role here in velocity I want you to take a look"
"7818880","7819220"," at this."
"7819340","7828300"," Uh, let's look at a 30 minute chart is a better place to look at it So let's take a"
"7828300","7829400"," look at a couple things here. "
"7829680","7837180"," We can see here that Uh 30 minute velocity is the one that I like to check That's the most"
"7837180","7838580"," consistent one for me."
"7838700","7846280"," So let's take a look right here in velocity We've got a topping In 15 we got a topping in"
"7846280","7853160"," the half hour and the hourly velocity Daily velocity though is coming up, right?"
"7853160","7860560"," Uh, so we're going to expect Uh, well, we want to see daily velocity come under right We want to"
"7860560","7866640"," see some negative velocity here on the lower timeframes the 15 minute the 30 minutes and the full"
"7866640","7872900"," hour here But we are expecting the daily to hold is the point that I'm trying to make here."
"7872920","7882180"," So Uh, if you if you finding that the daily velocity should hold Uh And that we're waiting for a"
"7882180","7892640"," pullback into Uh, hourly velocity would beg the question of uh the safe trade being Lower"
"7892640","7894220"," somewhere down here. "
"7894360","7903480"," Okay, some kind of a buy down below on spoons Right now that's at 432.01 and between now and"
"7903480","7913360"," tomorrow That should come up to Uh, come up to 433 85 435 Somewhere"
"7913360","7914280"," in here by tomorrow."
"7914280","7920740"," So the the question becomes the question begs Uh, can I buy a dip down here that's will be"
"7920740","7930100"," supportive or if price breaks below Uh on bad news tomorrow on some of the reports that we're"
"7930100","7938220"," getting When we begin to reverse to the downside Right, so we don't want to see this We don't want"
"7938220","7941940"," to see let me get rid of this one here Clean this up."
"7942080","7949480"," We don't want to see is price break below the hourly trigger And the hourly and daily trigger form"
"7949480","7955460"," a cluster of bearish reversal to the downside So you don't want to see anything like this, right"
"7955460","7964390"," where price comes down Right price breaks down and it's not caught by the dip by the hourly"
"7964390","7970690"," trigger, but in fact gets underneath The hourly trigger and then rejects and you get a power move"
"7970690","7980890"," to the downside To retest 429.46 or possibly even lower Uh, so this hourly is going to be Pretty"
"7980890","7982730"," important right does this hold?"
"7983610","7988110"," Um, and we're beginning to get a cross on the one minute trigger right here So we'll see if this"
"7988110","7998860"," will lend any support to price So in the one minute trigger here And delete this here And"
"7998860","7999940"," the one minute trigger here. "
"8000000","8001980"," We're getting the cross right now of the half hour."
"8002100","8007200"," This should lend some support Uh, and we should as the hours progress get some support down below"
"8007200","8012780"," here, but we are being set up by Uh economic news coming in tomorrow, right?"
"8013140","8017380"," So do we hold here and go higher or do we break underneath?"
"8018260","8021960"," All of these averages here and create a bear cluster, right?"
"8022800","8030820"," Um, so for me personally if you're looking for the safest trade You're trying to take something"
"8030820","8039820"," long here Um, you're good Uh, long as long as price stays above Uh, this hour and half hour"
"8039820","8040140"," trigger."
"8040360","8047680"," We still have not had Uh, a secondary cross from the upside, but bears do like to see that you"
"8047680","8053400"," get your first one right here And then bears always are sellers always like getting that power move"
"8053400","8060480"," down Uh, where you have a failure by bulls to move higher and they roll it to the downside So"
"8060480","8068520"," what you end up seeing here is you see a fake out Price goes higher And then there's a failure"
"8068520","8075910"," here All right, and they send you to the depths of hell down here, right?"
"8076110","8083670"," Some kind of a failure in here So if you're a bull looking for a long trade here It behooves"
"8083670","8092230"," you to um, it behooves specifically where we are for the for the uh specifically for where we are"
"8092230","8099970"," and Um, the the news that we have released is coming out tomorrow if you're a bull it would behoove"
"8099970","8110020"," you Uh to first watch price Come higher, right And"
"8110020","8119200"," then it for a pullback to happen to confirm the reversal Uh, and not enter another long trade"
"8119200","8124500"," unless it bounces and begins to move So there's two points here. "
"8124680","8134160"," The first point is Wherever this is you want to see strength in that move to Test this prior high"
"8135240","8140920"," Right, you don't want to see price come up just a little bit And then immediately fail, right?"
"8141160","8145660"," That's not a sign a good sign for bulls It's not a sign for you to take along there either,"
"8145660","8146080"," right?"
"8146220","8151060"," You don't want to see this So it would be prudent for you as a bull to see price come"
"8151060","8157020"," up come back down a nice big squeeze Come back down and then start to uh defend that one minute"
"8157020","8171260"," trigger So let's look at this on, uh, weebl, okay So on weebl There's"
"8171260","8177100"," a 15 minute chart here on weebl We've got the daily trigger here, right?"
"8177480","8185170"," The daily trigger is sitting at 433.85 Parked right here, right?"
"8186730","8196240"," Our only triggers on 432.01 And we're going to talk"
"8196240","8205760"," about What to expect here we've got Come on here This is"
"8205760","8212360"," friday right here What you don't want to get involved involved in i'm going to make this larger"
"8212360","8217980"," here for you so you can see it here And i'm going to explain to you what you don't want"
"8217980","8227549"," to get involved in, okay Or continue if you're a bull So for continuations sake"
"8229870","8237480"," Take Take a look at this right here So for continuations sake if you're a bull and you want to"
"8237480","8246900"," buy a dip listen listen here closely, okay If you're a bull you cannot buy a dip Unless we break"
"8246900","8249680"," above again right right there, right?"
"8250020","8250780"," Hold on a second here."
"8250780","8261860"," I'm fucking this up here Let me trash So Unless unless price regains 435"
"8261860","8263120"," 15 or so, right?"
"8263879","8265860"," You can't really take this long, can you?"
"8265959","8272459"," It's pretty simple there Right unless price regains it's putting above the 21 or 27 ema you've got"
"8272459","8273219"," no trade, right?"
"8273980","8280580"," But the one key point i'm trying to make to here is If price breaks below down to this hourly"
"8280580","8286700"," trigger You might be saying to yourself, hey cap should i buy that dip down there and the answer is"
"8286700","8296219"," no Uh, you want to wait for that bounce that dip bounce and to come higher And retest"
"8297299","8304320"," with with the hourly trigger so This this hourly is reliable, but now for where we are with price"
"8304320","8311120"," what you don't want to do is you don't want to get caught Buying this dip here Right it breaks"
"8311120","8317620"," below you get caught underneath and then it's more downside is my point So like this here once we"
"8317620","8323660"," begin to break down You still don't want to get involved in this Um, so what you need to see"
"8323660","8327340"," if you're a bull if we continue to break down is you want to see the bounce off the hourly"
"8327799","8335379"," the break above in the Successful retest of the daily trigger at that point with the hourly Uh"
"8335379","8341240"," coming back up to help you so this needs to come up For you to want that to get that"
"8341240","8346580"," continuation of the upside is the point that i'm trying to make Um, so again, it's always going to"
"8346580","8352360"," come back to this hourly trigger Right, so if price breaks below the daily and it bounces off"
"8352360","8358540"," hourly, you're still not buying it You're going to wait until price gets above And this is where"
"8358540","8365200"," your safe zone is as a bull With price actually higher than the hourly and the daily trigger a"
"8365200","8377620"," great a great bull trap here would be one here A great bull trap here would be For"
"8377620","8386080"," you to feel like yeah, hey, i'm going to wait For price to pull back I'm going to buy a"
"8386080","8390680"," dip and then you you get you get burned down here Right and then boom it's to the downside and"
"8390680","8395880"," you're caught in that trade So even if we pull back to the hourly trigger you're going to wait and"
"8395880","8402100"," watch to see if it bounces above And then you'll take the trade on a successful retest of that"
"8402100","8402940"," daily trigger."
"8403240","8408640"," So very important key point here Right you either get a successful retest here. "
"8408880","8410280"," We start heading higher."
"8410540","8420200"," You can take along and you're off and running You're not taking the trade Down here You're not"
"8420200","8425160"," going to take that bounce you're going to wait for that bounce to be successful Come back down and"
"8425160","8431280"," retest as this hourly trigger then comes up And supports to move higher and then you'll reenter for"
"8431280","8438220"," more longage To uh 441 444 that kind of stuff 444 zero stuff stuff like that."
"8438280","8441000"," So for right now, there's no trade for a bull here. "
"8441140","8447820"," I don't see a trade for a bull uh, i'm looking to see i'm waiting to see if Daily trigger"
"8447820","8454420"," holds and the hourly trigger comes up and above and price begins to go higher Uh, or i'm going to"
"8454420","8464420"," be waiting for price to uh come down Bounce come back up And then the hourly trigger to"

"8862220","8865380"," news, right and velocity is still not on your side here."

"8872960","8882700"," well, let's Here's your daily trigger right here You get your weakness In"
"8882700","8889600"," spy let's say right you come up here you come back down and you start getting some bad reports And"
"8890480","8897660"," Uh, this all this bullishness turns into a reversal Where you get the power of the one minute"
"8897660","8903620"," trigger the five minute trigger the hourly trigger The daily trigger and it goes against you."
"8903620","8913540"," So I would say this You do not want to lose this hourly in daily If you see the"
"8913540","8918960"," hourly and daily being lost Uh All bets are off for bulls. "
"8919640","8924240"," So you do not want to see a break of 432 You do not want to see a break of"
"8924240","8933100"," 433 Uh for continuation to the upside Now so we're gonna watch this squeeze right here see if the"
"8933100","8939800"," bulls and the buyers are still here Uh, we'll see if they can squeeze this up and over we want"
"8939800","8945180"," to see if the if the bulls are actually here Or if this is just a squeeze for more positioning"

"8949140","8954660"," You don't want to see any weak weak bumps You want to see like big squeeze up Pull back and"
"8954660","8960180"," then and then the confirmation trade to move higher here Now, we'll just just this price action"
"8960180","8966920"," will show it to you believe it or not If the buyers are actually here or not We're gonna find"
"8966920","8976740"," out right now It ain't gonna take long here And my more cautious of crossovers that"
"8976740","8984960"," take place In non regular trading sessions, so I trade I follow the triggers on es and after hours"
"8986260","8993220"," Overnight trading and then I switch to spx for a true understanding of the cash market Although i'm"
"8993220","8994640"," trading spy as well."
"8994760","9004220"," Uh, we'll use spy for my actual trading now Now What I don't like about this specifically"
"9004220","9015420"," is What I don't like about this specifically Is there's no need to there's no need There's"
"9015420","9025220"," no need to uh be trying to second guess here um It this calls for patience So let's say we"
"9025220","9028920"," bloodbath it Um, and i'm sitting on my hands, right?"
"9029560","9039980"," Uh, but we we we we hold this right We come back up here Come"
"9039980","9050490"," back down over here And now we have the cross of the daily Something"
"9050490","9058920"," like that And I can have my finger on the trigger have a trade set up So if I see"
"9058920","9064720"," that confirmation trade there we come back down and test it Squeeze up come back down and we're off"
"9064720","9070820"," and running Like I can I can I can pretty much pretty much like Um, this is the place to"
"9070820","9078740"," put risk on right like here here That's that's for me to put the risk on up here Uh question"
"9078740","9087980"," marks on that right or Or we squeeze up and i'll have less question marks If we turn around so"
"9087980","9090380"," there's no real there's no real trade here for me right now. "
"9090420","9097020"," There's no real like There's no like compelling Well, there's no compelling like I should get long"
"9097020","9103420"," here Um, so kind of like need more action need more price action up More crossing of the daily"
"9103420","9113100"," trigger above the or the alley trigger above the daily trigger Not seeing that Sit on hands if"
"9113100","9120300"," you're a bull That's what I think and I think you have time You know, it's kind of like um"
"9120300","9126660"," It's kind of like when I was buying that four 18 420 There was a day or two before where"
"9126660","9132000"," you could have bought it And we blasted down right remember, um, let's go back and look at that."
"9132080","9141880"," So Let's see if they can bring this up here There was a um This is uh, where was it?"
"9143460","9145300"," So let's see they bring this up for you here."
"9145300","9153230"," There was a um There was a day right back here. "
"9153250","9162610"," So I remember I was watching And I saw people on fin to it That bought this one right here."
"9162610","9167530"," I remember I watch all I w- I remember everything you guys think I don't remember But I know"
"9167530","9174190"," bulls are buying this I'm for a factual bulls are buying this It went up into that close and there"
"9174190","9175890"," was one more drop down, right?"
"9177090","9179210"," Then that was the actual bottom, right?"
"9179570","9180890"," So let's look at that."
"9181070","9186470"," Let's pretend we add this to Um to where we are right now, right?"
"9186790","9192470"," So you're over here And your thought is well, they're going to buy this dip. "
"9192570","9196610"," We're going to continue on right to the upside but Surprise surprise."
"9196690","9198110"," We're down there, right?"
"9199090","9208770"," so That where we are for right now um Just begs the question to wait in case this happens"
"9208770","9211710"," or We just start running it back up again."
"9211850","9213230"," You can jump on board over here. "
"9213390","9213910"," Does that make sense?"
"9214510","9219990"," So I think we just just some patience Uh, let this news start to come out tomorrow morning."
"9220150","9225650"," Maybe there's some weakness and then it bounces Get back to the to the move at hand to go to"
"9225650","9233370"," the upside I think there's just exude some patience here if you're a bull uh be patient sit on your"
"9233370","9243630"," hands and uh wait for uh be a bull have some patience wait for um Wait"
"9243630","9244590"," for be patient."
"9244630","9248150"," I guess is all I have to say here And uh, just give it till tomorrow. "
"9248430","9258960"," Let the market breathe a little bit Uh and see if you can get a better viable dip lower That's"
"9258960","9264320"," what i'm hoping for i'm hoping for an early morning retest And I don't want to get caught in uh"
"9264320","9265040"," a reversal."
"9265360","9269480"," I don't want to get caught underneath the daily trigger Underneath the hourly trigger and they just"
"9269480","9273000"," start ripping us to the downside Uh, so the setup is there."
"9273120","9275080"," There's a bull trap hiding there is my point. "
"9275320","9279720"," There's a bull trap here There's setting you up for it and you don't want to get caught in it"
"9280240","9284940"," So if you get caught in that bull trap and they start sending us lower You're gonna be pissed"
"9286120","9295800"," You're gonna be angry All right, so uh she came of a princess king is saying they're gonna be"
"9295800","9305800"," patient Yeah, jimmy berry's making the same point he's saying 434 60 needs to hold Or we're going"
"9305800","9314740"," lower No, so have some patience Uh where the market is right now I guess the point here is You"
"9314740","9316740"," can you can you can be bullish here."
"9316940","9323140"," Just let it show you the way Let price show you the way first give it some time to show"

"9385860","9392340"," it right there And then they get the second cross right here and it's normally a power move down"
"9392340","9398340"," The second you get the first cross second cross and it's usually violent to the downside And so"
"9398340","9399440"," that's what they're doing right now."
"9399620","9404940"," They've given you a violent cross to the downside reversed it on you Uh, we're now trading down"

"9426720","9432020"," Let's say the half hour trigger in a 30 minute chart right now This is the one that I like"
"9432020","9432700"," to watch here. "
"9432900","9438220"," So Um, let's look at that 30 minute chart and these still aren't at zero yet."
"9438340","9438540"," Are they?"
"9439900","9442860"," Uh, they're still not rolling lower yet."
"9443060","9451060"," Are they so still still probably some more downside to come not guaranteed but Uh, I want to see"
"9451060","9451700"," some more blood. "
"9451880","9465490"," I guess I want to see more blood in the marketplace here I want to see I"
"9465490","9475490"," want to see something more like this I'd like to see something"
"9475490","9479530"," like that right there So we'll see what you got."
"9479650","9480830"," Let's see what you guys think in the chat."
"9480950","9490490"," See what you guys what your interpretations are um Or they hold well across overs occur during"
"9490490","9499010"," regular trading session uh So Let me say I'm worried this better When you get the initial break"
"9499010","9500210"," over the daily trigger, right?"
"9500470","9503770"," So price goes above Squeezes above we talked about this yesterday, right?"
"9504190","9509750"," You get the initial squeeze over the daily trigger Price comes back down into the daily trigger"
"9510850","9519890"," Your job Is to is to sit on your hands And see if the agos uh buy So if the"
"9519890","9526850"," agos do buy that daily trigger recheck that retest That kiss trade You can jump on it whenever that"
"9526850","9534670"," bounce happens Uh, but if it breaks through that retest you don't want to be down there buying do"
"9534670","9542030"," you so you're not actually buying that bounce You're not actually going to be buying this So price"
"9542030","9546670"," comes down You're not trying to like oh, I'm going to jump on a landmine there. "
"9546830","9552370"," I'm going to jump on a landmine there You're actually looking for the bounce first Right the"
"9552370","9560530"," confirmation Process And then you're picking your poison up here You're not buying this or you're"
"9560530","9568950"," not like buy here DCA here And hope and pray that it's going to bounce and come up and then"
"9568950","9573810"," you can add here and that kind of stuff You don't do any of that you're just going to wait"
"9573810","9579890"," and watch the price action Now the price action tells you we're going higher than you jump in over"
"9579890","9582510"," here Your buy is actually over here."
"9582730","9583670"," So it's not over here."
"9583950","9590490"," You're not trying to save lives You're not jumping on hand grenades over here Uh, you're waiting"
"9590490","9596130"," for one of two things you're either waiting for price to confirm above in the cross On the one in"
"9596130","9603210"," the five minute Take it higher or you're waiting for the roll down And the confirmation move up to"
"9603210","9603830"," jump on it. "
"9603850","9609570"," So you got time there's time here Now for you to you to you to look for price action to"
"9609570","9614330"," show you the way and right now the price action is showing You've got no long trade here."
"9614430","9614890"," You got nothing."
"9615190","9615930"," Not right here. "
"9616030","9626980"," Now where we are Not statistically to prove that you're going to always be right So you got here 20"
"9626980","9627620"," more seconds."
"9627900","9628920"," Thank you for following larn."
"9629000","9629960"," Yeah, thank you larn for following. "
"9629960","9640960"," I appreciate it Let's see what I'm saying Waiting for the big payout right on 434"
"9640960","9642400"," puts are pumping in my opinion."
"9642400","9646820"," We just saw the high for the month of october So Jason Myers saying that's the high we're going to"
"9646820","9654160"," roll from here to the downside Jason Myers if you're looking for if you think that this is the high"
"9655060","9664900"," You want to get underneath 432 you want to get underneath 432 and start rejecting Uh for that to be"
"9664900","9665320"," your thesis."
"9665640","9671180"," So if you get that if you get priced underneath 432 I will tend to agree with your brother and"
"9671180","9679310"," to agree with you there Between two guys, baby. "
"9679650","9681370"," Uh the warm firm, baby."
"9682010","9686230"," Absolutely There's no there's no trade right now."
"9686510","9692230"," There's no trade for you even as a bear Like you can trade this right here if you want as"
"9692230","9700470"," a bear, but Uh and put your stops above the real trade for you as a bear though Is uh"
"9700470","9706590"," the real trade for you as a bear is like a breakdown over here And then price will come up"
"9706590","9713390"," and fail If you see that price fail right there Uh, that's your short opportunity and this should"
"9713390","9721670"," blast down on the depths of hell It should be like some kind of like failure Uh There's what do"
"9721670","9725610"," I call it like you let it let the bulls that are being drowned up for a brief moment of"
"9725610","9729930"," air Like you're like you're drowning them for apples and then you let them up their head up give"
"9729930","9736430"," them one quick breath They think they're out of the water Like down here comes up here rejects and"
"9736430","9742070"," then boom there's the there it is So you just i'm waiting for that weakness If there is no weakness"
"9742070","9746850"," and we actually blast higher and come back down then the the bear trade is done And there's the"
"9746850","9755790"," it's actually a bear A bear um It's actually a bear Trap now there is something else fascinating"
"9755790","9765730"," here and that would also be that Whatever news is coming Uh not to expect more weakness than 430"
"9766670","9773690"," And i'll be honest like 430 is not so bad is it so even if we do get bad reports"
"9774510","9779650"," I'm not going to expect to move move lower than 430, which is pretty good also. "
"9779870","9783670"," So Uh, I guess I would say as captain jim james."
"9783770","9793490"," I would enjoy A buy at 430 Although I really don't want to see price break below That daily"
"9793490","9797270"," trigger and that hourly trigger uh combination of the two."
"9797450","9806760"," I don't want to see either of these two break Although I really would like to buy 430 again. "
"9807160","9812560"," I honestly would so give me that 430 I guess would be my because i'm not long the market give"
"9812560","9822440"," me 430 Uh, how about charm"
"9822440","9822780"," flow?"
"9823580","9825460"," Uh, we need time on our hands."
"9826040","9833280"," So if we're going to move into a positive gamma Uh, we're going to need time at price on our"
"9833280","9839520"," hands Uh, so if we can hold this yeah, you'll get that charm Uh, you will get that charm, but"
"9839520","9845280"," that's that but that's still that time like Daily trigger needs to hold it needs to consolidate on"
"9845280","9851640"," that daily trigger in the hourly trigger And uh needs to begin to march to the upside You won't get"
"9851640","9858080"," that charm though If you begin rejecting to the downside of that 432 430 you can rip that charm off"
"9858080","9864400"," like Rip that charm up and just throw it in the fucking trash Uh, if we trade below 432 and"
"9864400","9870160"," 430 uh, but yes charm will kick in at some point That's a good question another that's actually a"
"9870160","9874460"," great question All right, so that's all I think I got for you."
"9874600","9876680"," So, uh, I have to get off right now. "
"9876740","9882900"," I've got my computer is crashing in the background And I need to um, I need to reach out to"
"9882900","9884320"," james roland and give them."
"9884580","9892140"," I want to try to get him a bottle of wine or whiskey or Um Wine whiskey or some tequila"
"9892140","9893140"," or something for tomorrow."
"9893640","9903340"," So expectations for tomorrow If we're going to go to spy and we have news coming out Uh, what I"
"9903340","9913560"," don't want to see tomorrow or expectations for tomorrow And even into um friday Uh, I'm"
"9913560","9914560"," going to expect some weakness. "
"9914900","9922960"," So I expect weakness in tomorrow Uh, I'm going to expect, uh, the morning to be sold in"
"9922960","9929640"," anticipation of the of these reports Uh, but I do expect this uh, this daily trigger this 432 to"
"9929640","9936980"," hold Or even possibly Even possibly for this to come up a little bit Uh, but to expect the hold"
"9936980","9939060"," that we are going to make our way higher to 444."
"9939640","9944820"," I'm bullish here Uh, as of right now that we're going to get a successful retest, but I do want"
"9944820","9954260"," to warn you that if by tomorrow morning You begin to see price, uh, reject Uh, below this 432 that"
"9954260","9960080"," you're going to Uh, any kind of rejection here arely triggers up here at the daily and you start"
"9960080","9968720"," seeing rejection Uh, I'll forecast you a definite price target down below of Uh 430 And if we get"
"9968720","9974880"," below the 430 at any point And the hourly trigger starts to chase to the downside and the daily"
"9974880","9980480"," trigger begins to chase to the downside We could be looking for a significant downside moves into"
"9980480","9990560"," friday Uh, those targets down below below that 430 Below 430 Uh, would be, uh, 420, believe"
"9990560","9994900"," it or not 420, so that's a pretty significant move, right?"
"9995340","10001960"," So be aware of uh, beware of price action being king I want you to know that even if we"
"10001960","10008220"," get this weakness down here what you don't want to see is the pinning Underneath if we do in the"
"10008220","10014220"," hourly trigger comes down Uh, we will be looking and seeking out that 420 and possibly even lower"
"10015080","10016260"," Down here into friday."
"10016520","10023160"," So so today's our tomorrow overnight the news Price action is going to be king You do not want to"
"10023160","10023960"," be underneath 430. "
"10024600","10031760"," You know that you know that 432 is the line to hold Uh for bulls to have continuation of the"
"10031760","10039800"," upside and I personally am going to be looking for Uh, personally be looking for weakness Hold Get"
"10039800","10045660"," above and get the help from that hourly trigger to begin to make that move higher Uh, right now"
"10045660","10052880"," currently no position into into into into tomorrow or friday I am going to play the waiting game"
"10052880","10058680"," and look for a dip to buy tomorrow on the open If we do end up getting some bad news"
"10058680","10065140"," and we begin to reject 432 We'll have a breakdown to 430 if we pin and hold under 430 All"
"10065140","10071960"," bets are off the table and look for a major downside move to 420 You guys have any questions for"
"10071960","10081630"," me You guys have anything at all for me for the rest of today Charm flow you're not going to"
"10081630","10087670"," see charm flow until we get above Uh the daily trigger we retest that daily trigger and the hourly"
