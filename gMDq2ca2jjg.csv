"gMDq2ca2jjg","90000","98000"," Any of you all in those 470s, those 470 Cs expiring today?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","98000","106000"," Those are, I think, I have a feeling those are going to be worth a lot of money."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","106000","111000"," Good morning, Ricardo, Garret, Mikey, Euroboomer, Angie, Mr. Broome."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","111000","115000"," Love that, Mr. Broome."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","126000","128000"," Happy holidays to all of you out there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","128000","129000"," Morning, Adam."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","129000","131000"," Yeah, those are some banging calls."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","131000","134000"," Banging calls."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","134000","136000"," Let's see what we got."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","136000","138000"," Nope, I'm not going to update anything this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","138000","140000"," Sorry."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","140000","148000"," So we'll do it to start the morning as we'll start with the Tesla feed and the Spy Feed."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","148000","158000"," I know a lot of you guys are, guys won't definitely want to see the Spy Feed as that's the general market."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","158000","159000"," Good morning, Ben."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","159000","160000"," Good to see you, brother."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","160000","163000"," Happy holidays."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","163000","168000"," Yeah, the 470s are definitely rocking."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","169000","170000"," The 470s are stupid."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","170000","176000"," I bet they're up around 30s or 40s at that point."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","176000","185000"," So what's 40 divided by 8 is what, 5?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","185000","188000"," Morning, D, Matthew, Chris, Diamond Hands, baby."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","188000","193000"," You know it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","193000","202000"," So just before we get into the trading day, it looks like all the numbers were, you know, they're all in line just enough pre market."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","202000","205000"," We have more buyers than sellers, sellers are being absorbed."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","205000","211000"," That's good to see."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","211000","213000"," Yeah, it's been good money."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","213000","227000"," The trading's actually been good both sides because we're hitting support and resistances bouncing off and it's wild, but it's still, it's still, at least you know where we're going."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","227000","242000"," That's what that's what part of that video was about last night is that we've consist pretty consistently stayed within."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","242000","245000"," With respect and channels."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","245000","247000"," So that's what I want to talk to you this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","247000","256000"," If any of you guys are listening right now or whoever is here right now, I didn't want to post this publicly."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","256000","259000"," Good morning cooks, good morning, CJ, good morning Ricardo."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","259000","260000"," Have a slew of calls and spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","260000","261000"," Great, great."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","261000","262000"," Matthew."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","262000","263000"," Good morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","263000","265000"," D, Jarkin."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","265000","266000"," T crown."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","266000","268000"," Good morning, brother."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","268000","272000"," So just briefly before the day gets started, it's 914 a little late here this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","272000","276000"," Got a bunch of stuff I'm looking at this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","276000","280000"," I need to look at a few more things."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","280000","284000"," But I want you guys to understand that where we are."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","284000","287000"," We should be pinned at this point or go higher."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","287000","292000"," Like, let's just say off the bat, we're in a bullish context."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","292000","296000"," There's no reason for us to not go up this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","297000","299000"," We should be able to know if we're going to go up."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","299000","302000"," I have some calls here that I'm going to."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","302000","309000"," I need to log in as a matter of facts so that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","309000","311000"," I'm going to take a look at this right at the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","311000","314000"," So we can, what we can, what we can."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","314000","316000"," You want to look underneath the hood, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","316000","318000"," As we head into open today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","318000","323000"," And I want you guys to be looking at the interest and calls for the 29th,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","323000","327000"," 31st around 478, 480."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","327000","331000"," You can usually figure out."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","331000","336000"," If the dealers, brokers, the banks, everybody, if they, not us, not retail."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","336000","340000"," Talking about."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","340000","345000"," Does anyone else believe that we're going to 478 or 480."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","345000","348000"," Before the end of the year."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","348000","350000"," And right now they don't believe we're going."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","350000","354000"," Right now I haven't seen a huge kick in my."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","354000","356000"," Like I've got my, all my calls have done great this week."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","356000","359000"," Head into 470, but the 480s."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","359000","361000"," Have no big at them."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","361000","363000"," Until after the first."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","363000","367000"," So that gives you some kind of a clue as to."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","367000","372000"," Do they think we're going up my God."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","372000","379000"," My broker just looking good this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","379000","380000"," Okay."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","380000","382000"," What am I looking for here?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","382000","385000"," So I point behind that is."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","385000","389000"," You want to see that kick in at some point this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","389000","391000"," After the open belt."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","391000","394000"," That's either through where we are."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","394000","396000"," And the price of spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","396000","398000"," The actual price of spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","398000","401000"," And it's also in Dewey."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","401000","403000"," We want to be watching flow this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","403000","405000"," So that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","406000","409000"," Do we get a bid to 478 480."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","409000","415000"," Doesn't matter if it's just a few day a week weeklies or monthlies or three months."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","415000","416000"," We need to see that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","416000","422000"," We need to see the premium kick in on those calls today because if we don't see those calls."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","422000","425000"," Now the premium kicking on that stuff then."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","425000","428000"," We have somewhat of a small issue."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","428000","431000"," It doesn't mean we don't go there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","432000","436000"," But it's always nice to see at least a little bit of a creep."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","436000","440000"," I didn't see any creep yesterday."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","440000","444000"," You guys know what it's like when we start mountain up and we start."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","444000","446000"," We just start moving."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","446000","449000"," Then."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","449000","452000"," You'll see that creep and we haven't seen it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","452000","453000"," I haven't seen it at least."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","453000","455000"," I think people are worried about."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","456000","458000"," The JPM caller."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","458000","461000"," On the 31st."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","461000","467000"," Now I think one of the traders in the room said we're in the handle said."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","467000","469000"," He knew about the JPM caller."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","469000","471000"," He said there's no way it's been done yet."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","471000","475000"," So he's he's going against what all the discords are saying or questioning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","475000","477000"," At least the noise surrounding it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","477000","479000"," So I think his name is Bob."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","479000","481000"," You guys want to check him out."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","482000","486000"," And we've got more gamma coming off, which is good."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","486000","488000"," We've got all that kind of stuff."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","488000","489000"," Oh, it's mechanics."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","489000","490000"," Right."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","490000","492000"," So my point to this morning is this."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","492000","497000"," A point to you is that we'll probably get a pin."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","497000","501000"," Right around the 470 area this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","501000","508000"," So let's say we trade up to 470 in a green bar or we have a fake out with a quick red bar and then a group and then to a green."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","509000","512000"," You guys know sometimes we get pins on Fridays."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","512000","519000"," We'll usually tag that pin at some point in the morning and we'll do a slow sell off."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","519000","523000"," Sometimes we'll come back into the end or we'll sell off steep, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","523000","527000"," Usually it's sell off steep in a close, but it's Christmas Friday."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","527000","532000"," We often will just trade straight straight up like straight up at the end."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","532000","536000"," So if we miss it at the open at the bell, let's say we miss 470."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","536000","541000"," 4720 or so on ES."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","541000","542000"," We miss it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","542000","546000"," There's still a fair chance that even if we trade down slightly, we'll trade up to it the end of the day."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","546000","549000"," But there are some key things we need to be looking at."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","549000","553000"," Are we bouncing off 470 this morning?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","553000","556000"," And this is a prime time to put some cheap hedging on."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","556000","560000"," If you see, if when we get around that number this morning,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","560000","568000"," it behooves you to even if you take it along to put on something to hedge into not Friday,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","568000","571000"," but I want you to hedge into the third."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","571000","573000"," Get yourself some cheap 460."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","573000","575000"," I wouldn't even get 450s."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","575000","576000"," Get some 450s."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","576000","581000"," If the 450s are dirt cheap, get some 450s."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","581000","582000"," You don't need them to go to 450."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","582000","588000"," You just need them to go to 460 into Monday into the first."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","588000","592000"," If people are going to have in their mind that the JPM college is going to impact the market,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","592000","596000"," so you know you're going to get some volatility on the 31st one way or another."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","596000","597000"," Guaranteed."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","597000","601000"," It's almost it's almost a sure thing at this point that it'll leak out."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","601000","603000"," The bears will run with it as much as they can."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","603000","607000"," They're going to try and tell you it's going to be deep dark red by."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","607000","610000"," I'm sure that stuff get leaks out everywhere at some point."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","610000","615000"," At some point next week, it'll be the talk of the town."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","615000","617000"," But who should do that at this level?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","617000","619000"," This is where people start losing money."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","619000","623000"," Even if we keep grinding up, you want to hold your calls, you get your spreads, whatever"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","623000","625000"," plan you're going to have today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","625000","627000"," Let's say we go up to 478 or 480."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","627000","628000"," No big deal."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","628000","632000"," You can cut those hedges loose once we break through that 470."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","632000","636000"," If we break through 470 this morning and start heading higher,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","636000","640000"," that's probably going to be good for today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","640000","643000"," Even if we head up to 478 into next week,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","643000","648000"," it won't last into, I don't believe it'll last into the 31st."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","648000","651000"," So just be conscious of that as we move forward."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","651000","656000"," This is like being down around the 450 or 450 level,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","656000","658000"," 4480."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","658000","661000"," We're getting closer to that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","661000","663000"," But I have no reason."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","663000","668000"," The thing that's got me is that if you look at just the traditional chart,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","668000","672000"," and we've been down below now,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","672000","677000"," the thing the bulls have for them is we've hit bottom three times that, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","677000","681000"," We hit it on, well, shit, even more than that, if you look back in November."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","681000","685000"," But the first, the third, and then we hit it again on the 20th."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","685000","690000"," So there's a fair point to say, you know, just like we looked above and couldn't keep going,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","690000","696000"," that if we've tagged a third time down below, there's no reason to not suspect that we're not heading higher."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","696000","700000"," If I let the banks do that work for you, let them send it up over 470,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","700000","703000"," let them get it up to break 474.86."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","703000","707000"," I think that's still slightly on the table today to some extent."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","707000","710000"," So just keep that in mind."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","710000","711000"," Take some profit."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","711000","713000"," You don't need to have all the profit."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","713000","715000"," How many times have you guys heard me say that out there?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","715000","717000"," You don't need all the profit."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","717000","718000"," Okay."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","718000","720000"," So just keep that in mind as we move forward."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","720000","723000"," Let's look at the Tesla feed real quick."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","726000","729000"," You guys remember yesterday where the."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","729000","732000"," On Tesla, you guys remember where the support was, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","732000","737000"," Support being between 10 0 5 1000."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","737000","738000"," Right."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","738000","739000"," We said cut."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","739000","741000"," Have a stop loss here at 1000."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","741000","743000"," And you've got some more support building down here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","743000","745000"," The smart money's down here at 9 90."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","745000","747000"," We have weak support."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","747000","748000"," Now, this is consolidating."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","748000","751000"," It was at 10 10 and 10 20."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","751000","755000"," It looks like some shorts have lifted on Tesla this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","755000","758000"," Now, a little bit of resistance in 10 30."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","758000","761000"," And what will behold, what did we talk about yesterday?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","761000","766000"," The live stream was the real sellers are above at 10 50 right now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","766000","768000"," We're seeing that this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","768000","771000"," So there's some real caution this morning as we head into the 9 30"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","771000","774000"," hour with the with the bears."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","774000","777000"," You know, shorts are probably scared at some point this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","777000","783000"," I do want to warn you that big banks, big hedge funds will own Tesla stock."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","784000","787000"," Be actively shorting Tesla stock."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","787000","790000"," And so they'll sometimes sell into you, making you fearful."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","790000","793000"," And they own and the stock that they own."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","793000","794000"," Right."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","794000","795000"," So it dips."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","795000","800000"," They'll cover their shorts and then buy back the stock that they sold into weakness."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","800000","805000"," So if I own Tesla stock in short Tesla stock, I could do a dump."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","805000","808000"," Let's say a big dump of Tesla stock briefly."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","808000","812000"," That'll dump Tesla down like we had yesterday in the yesterday in the opening"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","812000","813000"," bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","813000","817000"," As soon as I dump that down, I can close my shorts if we're going up."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","817000","821000"," And then I can immediately buy back the shorts that I used to make the stock price dip."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","821000","826000"," Be aware of that as we do the open this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","826000","828000"," We got just about six more minutes left."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","828000","830000"," Tesla is a holiday play for me."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","830000","831000"," I like the Tesla holiday play."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","831000","836000"," I've got some, I've got some."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","836000","851000"," Let's put this up for the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","851000","861000"," Okay."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","861000","871000"," Yeah, our biggest gamma squeeze candidates are MC, Baba, BAC, BB, LCID, NIO, PFP, PLTR, silver."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","871000","876000"," I don't know if silver really is so fine."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","877000","904000"," T is still on that list."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","904000","907000"," I'm not looking at this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","907000","908000"," Getting close."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","908000","915000"," Got five minutes left until the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","915000","918000"," It would not shock me to see us go to all time highs by end of day."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","918000","919000"," I'll be honest."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","919000","923000"," Why my real real deep down opinion, the one that I believe in."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","923000","926000"," I think we're, I think we're going to go much higher today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","926000","930000"," I think we're going to get a, I think we're going to get a face rep in a close."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","930000","939000"," That's what my, that's what the, the gambling trader in me believes the rest of today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","939000","941000"," I have to open up shit options."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","941000","942000"," Okay."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","942000","945000"," A bunch of shit in there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","945000","950000"," All right."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","950000","952000"," You guys ever forget that you have calls?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","952000","958000"," You guys, do you guys have multiple brokerages with money just lying around in it?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","958000","961000"," Sometimes you place trades and forget them."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","961000","973000"," I've done that many times."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","973000","975000"," Reg, yep, there are regular hours today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","975000","978000"," Good morning, captain."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","978000","981000"," Yes, market is closed tomorrow."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","981000","983000"," Regular market hours today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","983000","984000"," Just, just so you all know."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","984000","985000"," Okay."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","985000","987000"," Regular market hours today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","988000","1003000"," We've got more sellers than buyers at the moment on Tesla, but I think that's just, I think that's a nothing burger."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1003000","1004000"," That's right, Matthew."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1004000","1013000"," Put your, put your degenerate hat on this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1013000","1018000"," Good morning cooks, warm bloodstuns."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1018000","1019000"," Yeah."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1019000","1024000"," I think it's normal to be taking some profit right off the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1024000","1027000"," So Mr. Yens got 475 before year end."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1027000","1028000"," Yeah."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1028000","1029000"," I like Mr. Yen."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1029000","1031000"," He usually has a pretty good grasp of the market."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1031000","1033000"," That guy is the goat man."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1033000","1034000"," He's the OG."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1034000","1036000"," I used to watch him all the time."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1036000","1038000"," He's taught me so much as a trader."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1038000","1041000"," It's unreal."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1042000","1045000"," Oh, Steve, food poisoning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1045000","1047000"," Oof."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1047000","1049000"," I hate food poisoning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1049000","1051000"," It's terrible."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1051000","1054000"," Good morning Ricardo."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1054000","1055000"," Good job."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1055000","1061000"," Good morning to all of you out there this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1061000","1065000"," So that was just my point was that, you know, take some profit off the table."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1065000","1069000"," Even if we keep going up, profit is good to take."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1069000","1074000"," This is the area that you want to at least throw just a little bit of hedge on."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1074000","1078000"," If you're a bear, this is the way you're looking for some things this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1078000","1080000"," Just like yesterday, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1080000","1083000"," You're looking for the reaction off hard resistance."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1083000","1085000"," Testo is the same way."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1085000","1088000"," We brought, we want to see the banks eat through resistance."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1088000","1093000"," You want to jump on that trade after the 470 mark and then ride that up as far as it goes."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1093000","1098000"," We already know that we've got resistance above at the all time."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1099000","1101000"," And then we have resistance building."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1101000","1106000"," We'll look at the spy feed before we hit the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1106000","1109000"," We know we've got resistance building above at 478."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1109000","1111000"," So you can see right here you got."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1111000","1118000"," You have hard resistance on the spy this morning right now at 469."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1118000","1123000"," You've got by the dippers at 468, 40, 467, 80."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1124000","1126000"," Setting up for the smart money."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1135000","1138000"," And you got some clear skies man to 480."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1138000","1140000"," This is ridiculous."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1140000","1146000"," So you can kind of see that right now as we hit the bell is that there's not much above."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1146000","1149000"," There's not much resistance above."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1149000","1153000"," This is not a heck of a lot of resistance here above the open."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1153000","1156000"," You got some big money down at 467, 80."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1156000","1161000"," You got some decent money at 468, 30 and 20."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1161000","1164000"," And your first resistance right off the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1164000","1166000"," This changes once we hit the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1166000","1172000"," You'll see the real money come into the market and it can somewhat change."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1172000","1174000"," So here we go."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1174000","1178000"," We're getting ready for the open."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1178000","1179000"," We'll take a look at that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1179000","1181000"," We'll put the Tesla feed on."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1199000","1203000"," We've got some sellers coming in right now on Tesla off the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1204000","1206000"," Just give it a minute to let it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1206000","1211000"," Let's see what happens off the bell here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1211000","1213000"," The same setup is yesterday."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1213000","1216000"," We had to dip down right at the open."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1216000","1219000"," You get panic, panic sellers."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1219000","1222000"," This, this is not a banks or retail."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1222000","1226000"," This is just shorts, short operations."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1227000","1240000"," And you'll see here we've got a nice, we still have a nice support that needs to be eaten through at the 1 0 0 2."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1240000","1243000"," We also remember that yesterday we had that nice dip down here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1243000","1244000"," I think it was nine."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1244000","1246000"," Was it nine?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1246000","1249000"," How deep do we go yesterday?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1250000","1257000"," So the low of day yesterday on Tesla was 989.36 or no, wait a minute."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1257000","1262000"," On the open, though, it was 956 53."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1262000","1263000"," That'd be it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1263000","1266000"," That'd be it by the dip all day long right now, but I don't think we'd get that low."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1266000","1271000"," I think we get legitimately possibly down to 988 at the worst."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1271000","1275000"," That's right down here at this 990."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1280000","1284000"," Let's see."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1289000","1293000"," What is my position here?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1294000","1297000"," This is five."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1300000","1304000"," God damn 470 C."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1304000","1307000"," Whoo."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1307000","1311000"," Did I say something about thousands of percents?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1311000","1313000"," Did I say that?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1313000","1315000"," I said that, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1315000","1317000"," We just hit a thousand percent, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1317000","1321000"," There's a thousand percent boom."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1322000","1329000"," There's your thousand percent on spy December 23rd, 473."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1329000","1333000"," Right out the gate, you see the buyers stepping in on Tesla."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1333000","1335000"," They aren't messing around."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1341000","1346000"," You've got clear skies on Tesla to see what Tesla's shaping up to be."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1347000","1352000"," You have thin, do you get thin resistance on Tesla right here?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1352000","1354000"," Tesla could be good to 1050."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1354000","1357000"," We've been talking about that since yesterday."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1357000","1359000"," See those big green bubbles right there?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1359000","1363000"," Those are sellers being absorbed."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1363000","1368000"," Now, those 470s are up to 79 cents right now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1368000","1370000"," Hell yes."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1370000","1373000"," I'm going to check to see what the bid is."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1373000","1379000"," Okay, so we've got a bid coming in for 478s and 480s in the spy this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1379000","1382000"," There's a real bid coming in."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1382000","1384000"," Let's take a look at those."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1384000","1389000"," We have people buying 475s right now on December 31st."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1389000","1391000"," That's a good sign."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1391000","1397000"," We've got people buying 480s on December 31st."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1397000","1400000"," That's a good sign."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1401000","1403000"," Yep, so we're getting a bid this morning right out of the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1403000","1404000"," This is very good."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1404000","1408000"," This is very, very positive for the market."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1408000","1415000"," We want to see the, we want to see the FOMO buyers stepping in."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1415000","1419000"," You know, FOMO buyers aren't, aren't often wrong either."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1419000","1429000"," They, they help us to expand the call wall to raise the call wall on the market."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1429000","1431000"," And we've got some flow coming in right now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1431000","1433000"," It's all big tech."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1433000","1436000"," We have N video nine orders right out of the bell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1436000","1444000"," You should open that up in your charts and videos got a huge bid coming in for 1223 300c."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1444000","1446000"," So that's all zero dates."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1446000","1450000"," Tesla's got a bid coming in 1000 calls 1223."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1450000","1458000"," Apple has a bid coming in 1223 and 1220 or 1223 1231."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1459000","1469000"," On 175 and 177.5 sees XLF financials 1231 39 strike."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1469000","1475000"," And I got some stuff for HIMX hurts AMD."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1475000","1477000"," Julie hurts is a good one."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1477000","1478000"," I like the hurts."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1478000","1484000"," T has a bid that so just to heads up if you guys are looking for a stock to squeeze today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1485000","1487000"," T is on that list."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1487000","1489000"," Be conscious of that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1489000","1496000"," Amazon's got a little bit of a bid coming into it this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1496000","1499000"," Spies cranking right off the bell guys."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1499000","1502000"," Spies going for it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1502000","1503000"," Four sevens."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1503000","1504000"," Oh, let's let's switch over."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1504000","1506000"," You guys don't want to buy the dip."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1506000","1508000"," We're going to switch back real quick to the spy feed."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1508000","1509000"," So these guys will know."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1509000","1512000"," So you're going to hit some resistance right here right at 4700."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1512000","1513000"," You see this?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1513000","1515000"," You're going to hit a little bit of resistance here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1515000","1519000"," This might be the moment to sell your FDs on spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1519000","1521000"," Even if we break through."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1521000","1526000"," Take some profit on your FDs on the spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1526000","1528000"," You can always reenter."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1528000","1540000"," See that nice little red this little this little cell level right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1540000","1545000"," Take a look at."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1545000","1553000"," And then what you do is pick it back up at four seventy and ride it to four seventy three fifty."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1553000","1559000"," So if you're day trading the spy today, it would be take some profit at four seventy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1559000","1561000"," This is what this right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1561000","1563000"," We were not bouncing off it, which is good."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1563000","1567000"," So so there should be a grind and then a push higher."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1567000","1572000"," You're by the dip in the spies four six eight point zero zero."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1572000","1574000"," You have light resistance above here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1574000","1580000"," So if we break through this forty seven hundred, you've got clear skies to."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1580000","1587000"," Yeah, you've got clear skies to all time highs today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1587000","1588000"," This will be wild."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","1591000","1594000"," You'd be blowing my doors off here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1595000","1597000"," So be conscious of the spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1597000","1601000"," There is a lot of work being done to break through four seventy the moment we break through four seventy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1601000","1606000"," You're going to see resistance form on the all time high number on spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1606000","1609000"," The bulls look like they're going to try for it this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1609000","1618000"," And then we're going to look at the Tesla again."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1618000","1621000"," Yep, by the dipper stepping in."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1621000","1626000"," Ten fifty is the price target for Tesla this morning."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","1638000","1646000"," My spreads."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","1646000","1649000"," And I have a huge bid."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","2157000","2166360"," hard work, and then you jump in and ride their tails up, okay? As a trader, that's what you're"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2166360","2172360"," looking for. You're looking for your entry. Your entry is not going to affect the price of a stock."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2173320","2177320"," You are going to look for when the bank center, these trades,"

"gMDq2ca2jjg","2198920","2200920"," at the ass call volume still."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2200920","2207800"," So we'll look at Nvidia. Let's take a look. I'm going to bring up the Nvidia feed real quick"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2208840","2212040"," so you guys can just see what's all the fuss about an Nvidia."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2221640","2228280"," Why? It looks like they're catching a bid right now, so let's take a look at Nvidia,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2228280","2234120"," see what is going on. Why is Nvidia so hot this morning?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2247880","2254360"," So Nvidia has some resistance at $2.96.80. Buyers are stepping in strong here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2255320","2262600"," So I see why. So you got major support down here at $2.94. It looks like buyers are stepping in,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2262600","2272920"," sellers are disappearing. See why this is. What is the plan down here?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2274840","2282680"," Because we've got some resistance above at $300.305. You've got way more buyers than sellers."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2282760","2284760"," Maybe there's a hedge coming off Nvidia today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2287800","2294840"," I'd be wary of this one. You need to see some overwhelming. There's got to be a hedge that's"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2294840","2299080"," too low down here. That's the only thing I can think of for why there's so many buyers coming"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2299080","2304040"," in right now. It's going to be a hedge that's expiring. Probably a hedge that's expiring today,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2304040","2311480"," and you've got hard resistance at $300, limited resistance at $305, and then very light resistance"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2311480","2324840"," at $310. But you've got overwhelming buyers. You have $684,443,000 on Nvidia."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2327480","2333400"," If you break through $300, or $305, you've got some pretty big skies up there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2334200","2344680"," I wonder what the $305s pay. Let's take a look. They're all buying $305s. So you've got $300s,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2345400","2353880"," $315s. People are buying the $1231, $315. Oh yeah. So here's my thought on Nvidia. There must be a"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2353880","2362600"," hedge coming off on either today or next week. If I had to guess, but there's a hedge coming off"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2362600","2369240"," Nvidia because people are buying the $315 calls for expiring on December 31st."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2380120","2392280"," Top 10 focus this morning is Nvidia Apple Tesla Hertz Spy Fubo LVS Las Vegas Sands ACIW"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2393160","2408920"," Amazon XLF and HIMX. That's an interesting one. ACIW is a $40 stock. They bought a 9162022 call."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2413240","2421880"," This one's interesting as well. HIMX, it's a March 18th $14 strike for $200,000."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2422600","2427400"," That's an unusual option. I don't know if that's a run up into ER."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2430360","2435400"," Remember that too in your place in your calls? You place a call close enough to ERs in February."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","2889480","2894040"," Let's take a look at IWM as well. Maybe add some more. We'll do the spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2894920","2900200"," Let's see if you guys have any questions."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2904200","2909880"," All right, I'll check in here with you guys. She shattered about some 472s for January."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2914200","2919640"," I never played butterflies on Tesla ever. Tesla is"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2920280","2927480"," calls and puts. I have to do a video for you guys on Tesla on how to trade Tesla. I've said I'm"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2927480","2933240"," going to do one of those before in the past and I still have never made that video because Tesla"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2933240","2939960"," is my... So I traded Apple. I normally trade the indexes and I'll switch... I'll rotate between"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2939960","2948200"," the indexes and then I usually stick with one or two stocks for six months to a year and I was"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2948280","2953320"," trading Apple forever and ever and then I... Well, I shouldn't say I traded Tesla for three straight"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2953320","2958680"," years and then I hadn't... I traded... I traded years ago and then I started tree trading and"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2958680","2965480"," I got about three years ago and I slowly switched out of Apple because it became too much like"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2965480","2975080"," trading with a boiler room and so I trade mostly Tesla now as my single ticker. I never take the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2975080","2982360"," bare side of those trades but Tesla's pretty consistent on when to buy and when not to buy it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2985160","2990520"," Our HF's front running. No, you just got... We were end of year two. You got to remember that"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2990520","2996920"," you've got... There's some front running by shorts that want to get out of the Tesla trade right now"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","2996920","3003320"," but then you've got people that are trying to just get... Then you just see people that are"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3003320","3008360"," taking profit too, right? You know people want to take profit from their trades. It's the day before"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3008360","3019720"," Christmas. What's Max PT on spy in this run? Hey Cap, which day do you pay for the book map?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3020360","3025560"," Just DX feed. Now I've got some other... I've got the futures feed. I've got the one that's got like"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3025560","3031160"," the... It's got like four different... Four different feeds all together for futures."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3034200","3038280"," Classes are dropping soon. Spy getting a dip here. December JPM"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3038280","3044920"," card spread anymore. Wait a minute, I want to see that. Who's talking about that delta on the collar?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3046840","3048040"," Miss Brown, have a good morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3051000","3057320"," Good morning Tony X. Yeah, take profit. I like taking profit. Profit's always good."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3058040","3065320"," I'll look at it. I'll look at a... I'll look at AMD at some point."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3067880","3071880"," Yeah, those four seventies that I told you guys are gonna hit thousands. I told you."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3077640","3078760"," Jacob Warren, Jason."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3079160","3088280"," Is Tesla still good? Yeah, you guys gonna remember. You guys gonna remember that? You guys have to"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3088280","3095080"," remember that. So you see Tesla moving up right now? Now it's at one thousand eleven."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3097160","3102680"," You have light resistance here at ten fifteen. You can see your first wall is at ten twenty."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3102680","3111000"," You guys want it to be taking your own risk out there. You decide what your risk is."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3113720","3116680"," You can see that the buyers are now stepping up in Tesla right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3118360","3125160"," But this... So how I use BookMap is I define my risk, right? I say I'm waiting for nine ninety"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3125160","3130680"," five right here, right? If I miss this buy down here at nine ninety five or one thousand,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3130680","3136280"," this is the ice. This is what moves up to grab Tesla. Now let's say I miss the Tesla trade."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3137560","3142520"," I miss that trade. I wait for it to come back down to where I want to buy that"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3143880","3150760"," for the next move. You guys put all your own risk on your own trades. For me, I like to use BookMap"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3150760","3157800"," day trading because it gives me my defined risk. Now if I was looking at Tesla right here,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3157800","3164120"," I'd probably be buying Tesla on a candlestick chart not knowing where the buyers are. And right"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3164120","3169960"," now I know the buyers are at... The serious buyers are down here at nine ninety five. And I also can"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3169960","3175400"," deduce from this bottom right hand side that I'm still waiting for the buyers to overwhelm the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3175400","3181240"," sellers. So I'm waiting for a couple key things to take place for me to enter that Tesla trade."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3181240","3186440"," Now if I don't catch the Tesla trade and it just blasts off, this big swoop up motion comes in."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3187080","3193880"," Then you see them down here. You'll see this big mountain come in. And you'll see a big spike"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3193880","3200040"," right here. You'll see the big money, the smart money just swoop up and start destroying the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3200040","3206200"," sellers here. And it's coming soon. You can see it here down below. We've got 430 sellers. We've got"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3206200","3212360"," now we have 300,000 buyers. So you're going to see a big swoop up and we'll eventually start kicking"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3212440","3218920"," up on Tesla. But you have to decide when you're going to buy in to a position. You guys ever"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3218920","3224360"," noticed that when you you think that the buyers are there by looking at a candlestick chart but"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3224360","3231640"," they're not or you enter a trade too early but you see other people that are making money on these"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3231640","3237320"," trades. It comes down to the rules that you're setting for yourself as a retail trader. You guys"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3237320","3243800"," should understand too that you're not the one that's front running. Banks do their own front"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3243800","3250840"," running. You need to catch their tails. You want to see where they are in the trade. And then follow"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3250840","3256360"," them. And then you can go and brag to your friends and say, look, I drove Tesla up to the moon or any"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3256360","3264280"," other stock. Yeah, you're just seeing a pin on the spy right now. We're grinding the spy. I'll bring"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3264280","3272280"," up the spy once more. So I'm a buyer on Tesla at calling anywhere between 995 and 1000."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3274520","3279000"," 995 and 1000 I'm a buyer. We'll be looking for a swoop down one more swoop down."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3281080","3285320"," And spy looks like it's pinned. Absolutely looks pinned to me."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3286040","3293320"," You see an exchange of sellers and buyers meeting at 470. You probably see the 450 buyers that are"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3293320","3299320"," like, hey, I'm going to hand my bags off to you. There's enough room in there for you to get to"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3299320","3311320"," 478. And then the 470 or then the 460 buyers are like, I want to go to 478. And if any of you guys"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3311960","3321320"," are asking for full disclosure, I bought and sold 470 calls, bunches of them. And then I still own"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3321320","3335320"," some 470 4778 for 480 spread 477 478 spreads expiring at the end of next week. And I also have some 480 calls"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3335480","3343880"," for 80 calls expiring next week. I bought those real early. I want to see them grow."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3346680","3350280"," I think the worst pullback we'll have is 460 if there is a pullback."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3351960","3357560"," Remember, if you're a bull, you could put on some some some hedging right now while we're up here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3358120","3365560"," Maybe closer to close. I think I told the bears to buy hedging at 345 or so."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3367560","3371560"," That's when I figured they'd get real cheap that we'd sell off into the close possibly."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3371560","3388200"," Lots of calls on financials. You see Wells Fargo getting a bid."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3390200","3392760"," BAC getting a bid. Spice still getting a bid."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3393640","3398200"," Apple's getting a bid."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3402040","3409080"," If you're barely looking for the ticker R O S T 1231 108 P."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3413240","3417560"," M D still catching a bid. L sits catching a bid. Lucid, I should say."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3418440","3422920"," Peetons getting the bid. That's that pin's trade."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3427720","3432760"," Netflix is getting a bid. Let's check Netflix real quick. Let's see what's going on with Netflix."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3432760","3451320"," That's a nice trade. That Netflix trade would that's a nice trade for Netflix and to find out when"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3452120","3453960"," when earnings for Netflix."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3462760","3476200"," This is a pretty neat trade. So Netflix has their next earnings date on January 19th."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3478120","3483960"," So if you were to buy some February calls on Netflix at a nice round strike."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3486280","3487240"," Let's look at Netflix."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3492760","3514040"," That's some Tesla pricing right there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3522760","3530040"," I'm going to have to look at Netflix over the weekend."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3530040","3535240"," I'm interested in taking a call position on Netflix on the 31st."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3543960","3545080"," That's going to be a nice play."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3553320","3558760"," I'm interested in taking a call position on Netflix."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3558760","3563720"," Be conscious of this number back here for 69.50 on the spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3568760","3578760"," All this is right now is grind on spy. This is just the exchange of sellers probably down at the 450."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3579400","3585480"," Say nothing's changed here in the spy or on Tesla this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3585480","3590840"," You just see the buyers sitting down here waiting at $1,995."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3592040","3595480"," Resistance is still above at $1,000. This just looks the same thing"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3596760","3601240"," looking for resolution on Tesla. So these are all just kind of Tesla this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3601240","3608600"," Spy this morning just sideways pin."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3611800","3616280"," That's all good. I bet my spreads will look good at the close too."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3620600","3622280"," Tesla's now at 10.15."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3626120","3630520"," The discords are talking about Tesla right now that it's going to rip right through."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3631400","3633160"," There's going to be a move to this 10.20."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3633800","3639400"," Yep you see this right here this red bar so you can see right here at 10.10 buyers stepped in."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3640200","3642360"," See that nice red bar right here this is a push."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3645000","3648120"," See this nice wall of buyers coming in right now in Tesla."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","3724920","3727720"," We're almost there we're getting there real close."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3728200","3735960"," Real close to turning, turning bears into bulls on Tesla right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","3737400","3739400"," Real close right 10.16."

"gMDq2ca2jjg","4168040","4172680"," at 10.50 here. It's blue sky. This is all blue skies right here just so you all know out there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4172680","4175880"," Okay, this is nothing. This is all blue skies above."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4178520","4182440"," This is no resistance here. See this? See this right here? We just ripped through"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4183160","4188520"," shorts. Remember yesterday when this happened, what took place? You got blue skies to 10.50."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4192760","4194680"," Blue skies. Let all your friends know out there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4203560","4208760"," This is crazy. So pumped right now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4212120","4217880"," So pumped. You can wait to see this happen. This is going to be crazy. This is going to be a rocket ship."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4224360","4229480"," Hell yeah, Matt Kova, baby, baby. Get wrecked shorts."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4232680","4254280"," Let's go. Straight get wrecked. We'll watch this. We're going to rip so high right now. It's going to be funny."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4255080","4261560"," Boom. Need 11,000. Buy some of these some 11,000 calls here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4278920","4281000"," Oh yeah, right there. 26 cents."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4281000","4290360"," What are the 10.50 is that right now? All right, so I'm going to buy some 10.50s for two bucks or $1.84."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4290360","4310520"," Yeah, 10.50s are from $1.84 to $200 or two bucks now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4312040","4316600"," Yeah, we're hitting 10.50 guaranteed. I don't know if it's guaranteed but"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4317240","4325720"," if we hit 10.50, I'll make 400%. So, man, we're good. Let's see, 10.50."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4325720","4342200"," Yeah, Tesla, we're going to crush it here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4344600","4347960"," We're at 10.23. This is going to be a moonshot. You'll see the moonshot."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4347960","4356120"," You start seeing the buyers consuming the sellers here on the right-hand side."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4357320","4362520"," It's a matter of time now. Hell yeah, Adam."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4367800","4374760"," I'm on Tesla calls right now, 10.50s, expiring today at $1.86."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4378440","4393880"," They should print 400% if we keep crushing it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4394840","4404440"," Yeah, we tagged 10.50 that would be worth like 8 bucks or something."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4409400","4415880"," Whoo! Look at that big buy. See that right here? Huge buy right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4415880","4427160"," 51.44 at 10.25. Buyers know what's up right now. There's clear blue skies."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4427160","4431640"," Let all your friends know on Twitter. You got clear. Take a screenshot of this if you want."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4431640","4434520"," Send it up to Twitter. Clear blue skies to 10.50."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4442040","4442840"," That's crazy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4447560","4450760"," 10.26, right on, right on. Boom!"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4461640","4472680"," In a second here, I'm going to make a post on Twitter."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4491640","4519080"," Yeah, we're already up 50% on 10.50s."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4521640","4538280"," This is crazy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4540760","4543080"," Look at that. Do you guys see the buys coming in right now?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4544600","4547560"," See this right here? What you guys look in the bottom right-hand side."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4547560","4555960"," You see now how the buyers are consuming the sellers? We've got nothing but clear blue skies"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4555960","4560440"," ahead here. You're going to eventually see the buyers just consume. You'll see more buyers than"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4560440","4567560"," sellers and as soon as that triggers, we'll be heading towards 10.50. Yeah, Matt. Crankin'"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4567560","4573480"," brother. Crankin'. Patrick, have a great morning. You're welcome, G-Gen."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4578520","4583960"," Yeah, you're going to see this big flip happen up here. We're at 10.29 already."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4584840","4588600"," Bye-bye, 10.20. We're at 10.28.60."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4588600","4616760"," Do you want to keep seeing this right here? See these buyers right here?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4617720","4621240"," You want to make sure these buyers stay in right here on the right-hand side."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4623320","4632680"," If you see these buyers disappearing, the next bounce should be at 10.20."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4639800","4644040"," Good morning, everybody. Yeah, Tessa Feed's pretty good, huh?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4647480","4661560"," You've got some buyers stepping in now at 10.23, 10.24. You've got firm support down here at 10.20."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4662680","4668600"," This resistance has now become support on the intraday and you've got some buyers stepping in"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4668600","4675000"," here already at 10.24. These white shades here, this is all this ice right here. These are buyers"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4675000","4681800"," stepping in and you've got some pretty upset bears ahead above at 10.30 now. They're all cranky pants."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4689640","4698200"," Good morning, Damien. Detroit EV, right on, brother. Whoever you are, I moved to Detroit."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4698840","4704120"," Happy Festivus, Bobcat. Happy Pagan Day. Some of you out there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4707320","4712520"," You know the smart money's down here at 10.20, right? And whenever you see this white kick in,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4712520","4725240"," these are buyers stepping in above. You'll want to see this red swoop up into this area right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4728840","4735560"," And buyers are just about to start consuming the sellers right 529 to 596."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4738760","4749560"," Happy Holidays to all of you out there. I'm going to check flow. I'll go."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4752920","4754920"," There we go. There we go. There we go."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4758680","4761320"," Back up at 10.29. Now we're at 10.30."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4768680","4769640"," Merry Christmas."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4781640","4782120"," Bam."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4788760","4793240"," 10.50s, 355."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4796840","4797800"," Hell yes."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4801880","4802440"," Cranking."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4806280","4807320"," Bye bye shorts."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4809720","4810760"," Just rectum."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4819080","4823000"," You got some bear panic. They're coming down. They're at 10.50."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4823640","4830440"," You can see it right here. You got blue skies above 10.29 to 10.50. Blue skies. Hands down."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4830440","4845880"," 10."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4846840","4847400"," Killed it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4851560","4853880"," Hey, Mero. Big in bank, right, brother?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4861320","4868120"," Oh, I sold. Let's dump this to 20 now, guys."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4871720","4876840"," We're making another rip up here. We have some resistance forming at 10.35 right now,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4876840","4883000"," but buyers are starting to get in control. You can see down below that sellers are being overwhelmed."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4890840","4898120"," They're going to try that reversal bar up here, but you can see from book map"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4898120","4904840"," that there's no real reversal here. You do have some form of a wall coming down from 10.40,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4904840","4910280"," 10.50. You've got some resistance forming. You got to remember, too, that up around 10.50."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4910280","4914520"," That's our max height that we should be at. But you can see right here, buyers stepping right in"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4914520","4919880"," right here. You might get a double reversal here. See how these buyers are stepping into 10.25?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4920680","4927160"," Not even blinking. These are the days when you start seeing these big rips on Tesla."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4929560","4932520"," That was a great run."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4933160","4941960"," So, support kicking in now for Tesla."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4952200","4960440"," What's this, Congrat? Right on, right on, six shoe shiner. How's the spy holding up?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4960440","4965000"," Yeah, we'll take a look at the spy real quick. Let's take a look and see what's going on."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4965720","4970840"," Same old, same old, it looks like it can be wrong here, but from my, from what I'm fit,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4970840","4975000"," what I'm, so there's a couple things you know about the spy, okay? Let's have a spy real quick."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4976840","4982520"," So, the spy is in a consolidation phase. You've got almost like a rotation, right? Like you see"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4982520","4989880"," on an OPEX. We have an OPEX today for the holidays. So, all you're seeing is a pennant 470. You're"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4989960","4996840"," seeing sellers that were in at 450 taking profit and you're seeing new buyer and you're looking"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","4996840","5005000"," for either new buyers coming in or for us to sell out of 470. And right now, you can see that the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5005000","5013480"," buyer, there's buyers that believe in 478 and 480 for next week. So, right now, the Christmas rally"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5013480","5020600"," looks very on for into next week. And I also, you're also looking for the premium in those"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5020600","5027080"," calls to go up and they have gone up. I've got some positions here that are up nicely for the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5027080","5034200"," 478, 480 trade. My spreads all look nice and then let me check my, your break away from my Tesla."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5035000","5046280"," And my just single, single spy calls are all up as well. So, we're doing well. So, there's a bid"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5046280","5055240"," in the market looking for 478, 480. That's important to know. I got to get back to this right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5064200","5070840"," Now, if you were a bear, what do you, if you're a bear out there, you're getting bearish"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5071720","5076120"," on the market. Let's say you're out there and you're a bear. You want to be looking for,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5076120","5082120"," for the reaction that we had today on the spy, you're looking for taking, I wouldn't be buying"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5082120","5088920"," puts right now in the spy. I would wait for the last 15 minutes, maybe the last hour or so, but"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5088920","5096280"," maybe 3 o'clock in the afternoon. And you'll, what you'll see is probably a sell side for profit"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5096280","5105160"," taking into the close. And you'll want to capture some of that money on the puts that you take for"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5105160","5114360"," 460. And I would date them for at least the four or the third, so that you can, you can, you can,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5114440","5119240"," run that, ride that down. I'm not sure right now that we're heading down to 460. But if you"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5119240","5124920"," wanted to put on some, for the reaction that we're seeing today, I'm not bearish at this point."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5125720","5129640"," Although we usually do pull back a little bit, even if we are going up, and we still have that,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5130200","5141080"," that JPM caller trade on the 31st to consider. I'm going to be looking for that to be adding for"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5141080","5151240"," January, February ER trades. You can see they're moving our way back up on Tesla 1028. So you're"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5151240","5157080"," looking at two trades, right? You're looking for a trade to 478, 480. You're going to hope that we"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5157080","5163560"," make it up there before the 31st. And then you're going to be looking for some sort of reaction"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5163560","5171640"," to the JPM caller trade that Bob was talking about. That's, that's on the 31st into the 4th."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5171640","5175400"," And you also want to consider some of the things I talked about in the video last night. And that is"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5176840","5182120"," take your profit at some point this afternoon. You guys want at some point they take profit on"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5182120","5189240"," just if you're holding like zero dates or five day calls, because you've got some, you've got some,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5189240","5194040"," some real killer theta stuff. Unless you're in spreads, you've got some theta kill that's going"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5194040","5199800"," to take place over the Christmas holiday. You're going to get some more theta kill. I think on the,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5200360","5206440"," I think we got a three day weekend or a short trading day. On the 31st, we have a short trading"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5206440","5212360"," day. So you'll get killed on theta on that week as well. So spreads that your friend right now,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5212360","5218680"," if you're going to be opening anything up, or waiting for the 4th possibly to tie on anything"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5218680","5223960"," for February, for January, February. Unless it's front run, it could possibly be front run now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5224920","5234200"," But my, my take would be to get some spreads if you're bullish that expire this upcoming week"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5234200","5243640"," on a Friday, or be looking for any kind of weakness to take that 478 trade. If there's any weakness"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5243640","5249560"," today, sometimes we sell off on Fridays, or in our taste Thursday, but sometimes ended. Well,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5249560","5257320"," some days, some are often on Fridays or OpEx being today, you'll see a nice pin, and then you'll"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5257320","5263080"," see a brief sell off the end of the day. This isn't always so this is not financial advice,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5263880","5270360"," but maybe you can grab a nice cheap, sweet, cheap call into the close there if you don't care about"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5270360","5278600"," the theta into Monday. My thought process is that we sell off on the end at the end of the day,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5278600","5285720"," we pick it back up on Monday. So be ready to take some profit today, boys. If you guys are playing"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5285720","5298760"," Tesla, there's no shame in taking profit up here at 10, at 1029. Excuse me, you got 1029."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5301080","5311080"," And we are about to overtake though, we are at 60 or 600,000 call buyers versus 657. So we should"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5311080","5318040"," see another move here in Tesla shortly. But remember, you have to you have to take on your own risk,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5318040","5323640"," okay? You can't be relying upon anybody else out there. Ultimately, the decisions that you make"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5323720","5330520"," are your own. But I'm still long right now. This consolidation should move us up to that 1035."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5330520","5339560"," We should break through here at 10. You should be breaking through here at 1031. Next stops 1035."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5340680","5345640"," And then the next stops 1040 and then 1050. I don't even know if the 1050s are still there."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5345640","5350200"," I think the bears are kind of set right now. Let's take a look at 1050."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5354280","5361400"," Yeah, they're making a stand now. So the bears are making a stand at 1050. You guys can see it right here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5363080","5367960"," So you've basically got clear skies above. You can see the buyers stepping in here. We're looking"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5367960","5376120"," for 1050. That's our goal, 1050 today. And it's 1030 in the morning. We've got some runway left."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5376120","5382600"," We've got till 1130, 12 o'clock till lunchtime. We'll see what happens here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5384600","5386120"," We've got some time. We've got some runway."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5389960","5393960"," Let me go check to see if you guys are commenting. I've got my eyes on both screen screeners now."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5396440","5403400"," Bob, who? Okay, so I was talking to a trainer in the... I was talking to a trainer. I made a"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5403400","5407960"," video last night about... So I can tell who's watched my video from last night and who hasn't."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5409720","5412840"," If you guys don't know what I'm talking about. So there's a collar trade that goes on."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5413880","5423480"," For JPM. So JPM is a long only hedge fund, right? And well, they've got a couple hedge funds, but"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5423480","5431960"," one of them is a long only hedge fund. And how they hedge their long only fund is with a collar"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5431960","5439640"," on the spy or an SPX, I think. I don't think it's a spy. I think it's SPX. Sloane, what's up?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5439640","5445000"," How are you doing? Hey, Carrie. Hope you guys are making money. I hope this feed is helping you"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5445000","5449400"," guys. It gives you that insight that you're looking for. So you're not just riding blind."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5451080","5458200"," So there's a JPM collar that goes on and comes off every quarter. They try to hide the collar"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5459080","5464040"," every quarter when they're taking it off and putting it on, but they've gotten sloppy with it in the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5464040","5472600"," past. What it leads to is usually now everybody knows about it, right? So now every quarter,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5472600","5480520"," it leads to weakness in the market, typically matching up to the low heading into OPEX."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5481080","5486360"," Now, not as low as the low. I don't think we get as low as 4,500. I think the low would be, well,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5486360","5494440"," maybe the low could get to 4,500. That's on the table. But the chances of us seeing 460"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5496200","5504040"," on December, the close of December 31st into January 4th is high. I recommend, at some point"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5504040","5511320"," today, that you go back and watch my video before making new trades so that you can cover those"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5511320","5518680"," trades if you are a bull or a bear in time and hedge appropriately considering that risk."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5518680","5522520"," There is that risk heading into the new year."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5526360","5534360"," Yeah, so just to heads up that, so I'm in this full disclosure. I'm in the,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","5535320","5542760"," I hang out sometimes in the spot camera discord and they've been talking about the JPM collar"

"gMDq2ca2jjg","6626920","6631640"," here. This is this is bullish. Okay, when you see when you don't see the buyers hanging out at"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6631640","6638120"," 460, you see them all above here. This is a move to push spy up. Okay, they're supporting the spy."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6638120","6644680"," If this changes at any point today, I will post about it. At the end of the day, I'll post about"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6644680","6650040"," where the real supports are heading into the clothes on the spy. Okay, so these buyers are"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6650040","6656520"," still here. If they move themselves back down to 460, we'll know at end of the day. This context"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6656520","6663800"," right now on the spy is that we're we're looking for 478. We're looking for Santa rally. Okay,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6663800","6670840"," and you guys can now post to me. You guys can now post to me if you want. See the smart buyers"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6670840","6677400"," down here at 469 40. You guys can post to me on on YouTube right now. And now I'll try to do four"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6677400","6683240"," five maybe 10 tickers for you so that you guys have some idea where we're headed to. And if you"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6683320","6687480"," guys are taking pride at some point, get your take a half an hour, sit down and watch that video."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6691640","6696920"," Look at this. You guys are awesome. There you go. That's how you trade Tesla."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6697640","6704760"," Doing it live with you guys this morning. It's 187 of you watching. There you go. There's a live"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6704760","6709560"," trade on Tesla. There you go for all you. I don't know. Some of you guys on Twitter, not"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6709640","6714200"," you guys here in this handle, but you regular Twitter folk out there. Tell you what, you're"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6714200","6723480"," always coming out after the trade. How about before the trade? How about how do you like them apples?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6727480","6733560"," Oh, yeah, the matrix. I wanted to talk about the matrix. Oh, dude, I fell asleep. That was"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6733560","6741000"," terrible. And then I woke back up for the end of it. I'll do Amazon and video. So dude,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6741640","6747480"," so there's a movie within a movie in that movie for sure, right? There's probably a good movie in"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6747480","6753480"," that movie. I bet someone's going to cut it down to a short or something that's decent."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6754200","6762440"," I wish they had made the movie like, you know what, you know what, I've done a good job with that"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6762440","6771800"," movie is the dude did the dude that does the M night Shyamalan a ding dong."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6773640","6779800"," I bet he could have done like an alternate superhero movie. Like remember the movie where"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6779800","6786120"," Bruce Willis was fragile or whatever. You know, just do a movie that's under the cover superhero"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6786200","6793480"," movie with with both Keanu and whoever that the the main lead female actress is something like that."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6793480","6797720"," And then you don't even talk about it being matrix. You like name it something different."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6798600","6804440"," You don't tell anybody. And then you realize at the end that it's the matrix. That would have been"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6804440","6809800"," so cool. Like a love story or something would have been really cool to change the entire name"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6809800","6814120"," of it. Don't tell anybody. You know how else did a really good job of movies like that was"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6815000","6820280"," the dude who did the movie about the monsters that were in New York ties them all in together."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6821400","6825640"," They're the AV or something. They're called they're called they're I forgot the call but"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6825640","6829720"," they're they're mystery their movies are tied together. If you have the name of the movies now,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6829720","6836120"," but like a mix between that would have been great because I did like the end of it when you saw"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6836120","6841880"," Keanu and her kind of like have an emotional moment that that was the movie to me that I wish"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6841880","6848680"," was made. And I wish the movie was made with a different like you didn't know it was a matrix"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6848680","6858200"," film. So we're looking at Nvidia right now. You guys want some real hard supports and resistances"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6858200","6867480"," and here you go right. So your by the dip is 294. First resistance 299 300 you're going to encounter"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6867480","6877080"," some heavy resistance 302 is good resistance is a feeder but you do have lots of buyers."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6878600","6883080"," You've got more buyers and sellers. That's a very that's a positive for Nvidia no matter"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6883080","6888920"," how you look at it. It means they're going to grind through these sellers. I'm assuming that"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6888920","6893400"," something is known. I haven't looked to see if the hedge is coming off an Nvidia. My assumption"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6893400","6898120"," is that's what's happening is that there's a hedge coming off and banks know it. And once that"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6898120","6905640"," hedge pops off you're going to see a rip on Nvidia. That's my guess. Yeah unbreakable is the movie."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6905640","6913320"," Like a mix between unbreakable. A mix between unbreakable and what's the movie with the the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6913320","6918520"," monsters like the monsters in New York and the handheld cam. Whoever that guy is he did the zombie"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6918520","6923320"," movie with the Nazis and shit like that. But he ties all these movies together. Like that idea"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6923320","6929240"," of tying a movie into the matrix. You don't know it's the matrix until like the end. And then it ends"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6929240","6935560"," up being like a movie about just Kyoto and you think if they if they if they promoted it right"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6935560","6939480"," you would just be like oh they came back together to act together again and it's love story."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6939480","6945080"," Maybe it's a thriller. You don't introduce though anything from the old matrix movies."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6945080","6949240"," No hints. And if you do introduce a hint it would have to be a hint that's a"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6949240","6955160"," smart hint. Like the the movie there with Bruce Willis from M. Night Shyamalama Ding Dong where"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6955160","6961000"," the guy was dead. You don't know that he's dead until the end. He treats you like a you're a smart"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6961000","6965720"," viewer. And when you're a smart viewer right and you have to you have to really dig into what the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6965720","6969000"," what the clues are that have been badass for a matrix movie."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6969000","6977640"," Yeah Martin saying that XBI is breaking out. XBI is a great trade. We talked about this trade"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6977640","6983640"," on Sunday or Sunday stock charting. We chose XBI so we didn't have to get into biotech"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6985000","6992120"," stocks. We just picked the index. Yeah Unbreakable is a great movie. Yeah Cloverfield like a time"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6992120","6998440"," between like how the Cloverfield universe is tied together. You tie in the matrix universe"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","6998440","7006280"," into a film like Unbreakable or a film like the one where Bruce Willis dies or his dad"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7006280","7011880"," you don't know his ghost. Something like that. 411 on Arm D.L. Maybe."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7016760","7021560"," Yeah they're doing that to movies right now man they're they're fucking up movies. They're"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7021560","7027240"," fucking up Ghostbusters and they're fucking up Star Wars. You know I'm bizarre."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7030520","7037400"," I'd like to see them create new IPs. That's what's bothering me the most. Just create some new IPs"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7038200","7041160"," instead of instead of just going back and rehashing this stuff."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7043960","7050120"," How do I get this software? Jin I will post everything you need to know today on Twitter okay."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7050920","7061160"," I'll post something on Twitter for you. Yeah we are ripping. We are ripping. We are definitely ripping."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7068040","7074280"," We are ripping. You're seeing some resistance in Tesla right now. You see the sellers"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7074280","7076200"," being overwhelmed by buyers."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7082040","7090040"," This is where major resistance is at 10.50. I gave a sell target of 4 or 10.48 to take profit"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7090040","7097000"," at 10.48 if you were paying if you were watching the live stream. We have balance right now with"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7097000","7103240"," buyers and sellers although buyers are still stepping in. Can you can we go higher than 10.50?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7103240","7109320"," Absolutely but again we're putting on. I ended up selling the IWM calls."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7111160","7113080"," Yeah I sold my IWM calls for profit."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7115480","7122600"," Yeah it is Coen brothers. Yeah dude even if you like Marvel movies it's so tiring right now to"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7122600","7129640"," watch Marvel movies. I really want Marvel movies with story like just story. Give me a story."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7130600","7136200"," I need story right now in my life and I'm not getting much story in a movie."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7138920","7143560"," I want a story. I want something that I can get absorbed in. It doesn't have to be a slow story."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7145640","7147720"," All right so you guys should have taken profit right."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7149640","7151400"," Did it really wake up to the petty?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7151800","7169080"," See the petty right. Let me look and see. That's crazy look at that. Look at that. Take the money"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7169080","7175240"," and run. Take the money and run not financial advice. You guys heard it right earlier in the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7175240","7181320"," broadcast. Take the money and run. How do you like them apples?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7184680","7187720"," Cheap hedges. You guys want some cheap hedges?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7190360","7194120"," All right let's look at some cheap hedges real quick. I'll start checking some of this stuff up."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7195480","7197480"," We'll make some calls for some cheap hedging."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7198120","7208840"," Okay spy. January 3rd. I'd be looking at"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7213240","7222200"," I'd be looking at January 3rd for 50 P's. Now I wouldn't be looking at those until"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7222200","7227400"," end of day. There is some interest in them already. Not a ton but there's some."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7228040","7233640"," They're at 42 cents. If you could get those at like 20 cents end of day that'd be awesome."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7234840","7242840"," If you could get the four 60 P's for January 3rd. I'd be looking to get those at 60, 70 cents."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7243720","7251240"," It would be a nice price on those. And I would cut them loose on Monday if the market doesn't go"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7251240","7257720"," down. So you're relying upon what you're trying to do is this. You're trying to grab them at like"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7257720","7261960"," 3.45, 3.30 in the afternoon, 3 o'clock in the afternoon sometime around there, right?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7264120","7268360"," You're going to hope you're going to be banking on some sort of a sell off into clothes today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7268360","7274360"," Now we usually rip up into clothes on Fridays on Christmas this week right here. So you're"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7274360","7279000"," going to be looking for it. If we don't get it, if it looks like we're going up into clothes,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7279000","7285480"," you'd wait until the last minute like 4.15, right? And you're looking for a price on 4.60."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7286040","7290360"," So if they're at $1.15 right now, you want to see them at like 60 cents."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7291000","7297720"," If you see them at like 60 cents, 40 cents, 30 cents. And if it takes you to wait until the closing"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7297720","7303720"," bell to see them that cheap or cheaper, that's when you want to buy them. Remember, price is"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7303720","7311400"," important on options. If price is high on a put or a call, you're buying in the wrong time."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7311400","7322360"," You want to be buying puts at like 30 cents, 15 cents at a resistance point, okay? Not at a dollar."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7322360","7327960"," You want to buy at a resistance point at like 20, 30 cents, 10 cents, 8 cents. You want to be"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7327960","7334360"," buying a bottom when calls that are that are like 10 or 150 points away. You want to be buying"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7334360","7341480"," them at like 8 cents, 10 cents, 30 cents is still okay. So that's what I'll be looking for. And I'll"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7341480","7345800"," post that on the handle today. If I buy some hedging heading into the clothes today,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7347400","7355000"," I'll be looking for a hedge today at some point myself. So I will, if I buy a hedge today, I will"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7355000","7362440"," post where and how I buy it. I post any trades that I make, I post them live. Like when I buy"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7362440","7367880"," them right then and there, I post that I bought this. I don't always, so I try to post when I sell,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7367880","7373160"," but I don't, sometimes I'll do it on live stream that I'm selling. Or sometimes I just sell that"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7373160","7377160"," I'm not on live stream. I'm not really feeling like posting because I post with you guys all"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7377160","7384280"," day long. You guys get a ton of my day from me. From me. So I'm not always posting when I sell."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7384280","7389320"," That's all to you when you want to take your licks or you want to hold through. This is still"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7389320","7395320"," not financial advice. You guys have to take responsibility for the risk that you're putting on in this"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7395320","7401400"," market and how long you put your risk on this market. When trades go wrong, I'm making videos"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7401400","7405960"," on that too, how to roll positions, how to add to positions. Like when to add, when to roll,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7405960","7410680"," when to hold, when to sell, and when to change your viewpoint on where we're going."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7414280","7421240"," Watch that video today. Yeah, I sold Facebook at a loss. I want BookMap."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7423320","7428520"," The hedges would be for the ones that I'm looking for for January 3rd."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7429160","7432760"," Maxfire is January 3rd."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7439400","7444680"," That's my target date. Yeah, look at Nvidia just squeezed. It squows."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7448440","7450040"," Nvidia just just broke through."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7450520","7460440"," So that's so we tie in flow to order flow, right? We do stock order flow. We match that up to the"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7460440","7467800"," to options flow. And you can see now we've got Nvidia FOMO buyers jumping in. Facebook's getting"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7467800","7474760"," a bit. We talked about that at the start this morning. We talked about Tesla this morning."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7474840","7479320"," Tesla this morning. All of these are tickers that are ripping at this point."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7481400","7485400"," So you guys are getting high quality alpha. So you know where to be trading."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7487000","7492760"," We talked about spy. We're at four. We just ripped on spy as well. We're at 471-47."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7493400","7496680"," So we're like four for four this morning at this point."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7499000","7501800"," Four for four this morning. Pretty good. Pretty good day."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7505000","7508440"," Yes, we got we're making some money. All right, so we're going to look at that we did."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7508440","7510040"," All right, you guys want to look at AMD next?"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7515720","7517080"," Let's look at AMD."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7525240","7526360"," Get rid of this one."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7534920","7544680"," We do have light selling in Tesla. Just so you know, profit taken."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7553240","7556280"," We should have AMD kicking in here in just a moment."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7557720","7561560"," And I'll do a post for you guys with a link to book map on the handle."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7562280","7567400"," And if you want me to do a video on how to set it all up, I can do a video."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7567400","7569800"," The videos out there are okay. They're not that good"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7574040","7577320"," on how to run and set it up. If you guys there are trading futures,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7577320","7582840"," you probably already know about book map for cash market. It's expensive to run it."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7582840","7590280"," But for me with with how I do my due diligence, my TA, all that kind of crap."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7590280","7594200"," And then I see market conditions and news and where we are."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7594200","7598840"," And then I do some traditional charting and then I wrap all that up with book map during the day"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7598840","7605000"," time and it tends to bring it all together so that I can make informed trades."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7605000","7620840"," Okay, so here we go. Ready? This is what we're going to be looking at."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7620840","7627000"," You've got a big fight going on right now on AMD at the 147 mark."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7628840","7633480"," This is good. This is very bullish for AMD. I'm sure we've got hedges coming off on AMD as well."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7634120","7639240"," Just for the look of it right now, it has a good high possibility of squeezing here."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7639960","7645560"," You've got your first major resistance at 150. If you break through, you've got clear skies"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7645560","7653240"," to 160 and then the wall would be at 165. If you don't break through today, look for weakness"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7653240","7660120"," down to 130. You have minor supports at 135 and 140. But AMD is looking good today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7661000","7665160"," I would suspect that AMD is going to rip higher today."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7667080","7670760"," It's looking very nice right now. It's already ripped higher. It's at 147."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7671320","7677720"," You guys are savages. You took it from 143 to 147. You guys are savages, savages."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7678440","7683640"," So we're eating through AMD right now. Be conscious of AMD as the day wears on,"
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7683640","7688840"," as sometimes people take profit around one o'clock, but it is Christmas Eve."
"gMDq2ca2jjg","7688920","7692600"," And you'll sometimes see a late rip end of day into clothes."
