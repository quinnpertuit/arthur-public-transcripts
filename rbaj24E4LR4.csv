"359360","364280"," If you can bring up a video from last night that I watched from CNBC this morning. "

"413960","416240"," You'll see we had the bounce down here. "
"416980","419860"," We're going to check this one in five again."
"420860","424260"," We get this successful retest should continue higher."
"424840","426800"," There is something to be said right here. "
"428300","430400"," There is something to be said this morning."
"430620","433680"," I watched a video last night from two days ago."
"435620","437520"," That somehow I'd missed. "
"438680","441040"," And it was a little disturbing."
"443980","445500"," Had to do with."
"447160","448920"," I believe it was on CNBC. "
"450340","454920"," So the reason I watched this or not reason why but I watched the video last night because I was."
"455280","457480"," We were in the options chain yesterday."
"460620","464040"," I was watching the options chain all day yesterday. "
"464040","469680"," And they were giving a 30 delta zero dates."
"470340","474820"," No pricing like so 30 delta zero dates weren't worth anything."
"477340","481160"," There is no pricing anything that wasn't in the money. "
"483460","486800"," Or slightly even front or like slightly in the money like."
"486800","490540"," Well I guess they're calling these a 30 delta now."
"490720","492680"," I guess a one strike is a 30 delta on today. "
"492960","493140"," Okay."
"497800","503300"," They're giving like a they're giving a point zero six deltas three strikes out of the money today."
"503920","506240"," And they did this yesterday as well. "
"508000","508560"," So."
"510940","513179"," It piqued my interest yesterday."
"515000","519059"," Because they were forcing you to stay long all day long into the clothes. "
"519539","522120"," If you bought anything that was dirt cheap like 10 cents."
"522900","525680"," 20 cents 30 cents you to stay in all day long."
"526520","529020"," And they didn't give the prince until the close. "
"531040","531980"," So then."
"533980","536900"," CNBC had a video must be a find it for you."
"538260","539800"," To show you a link to this. "
"542040","544740"," But there is an interview I guess I don't."
"544860","547600"," So I want you to know that I oftentimes don't pay."
"547600","551040"," I am eastern time to get us business inventories month of a month. "
"551500","555720"," I don't pay as much it like I follow the news the financial news."
"556520","560120"," But not like I once did nice to have CNBC on all the time."
"560620","565000"," And I'd read every article out there all the news you name it. "
"565080","567980"," I was like I would consume it non stop."
"567980","568880"," And."
"569880","572540"," It was really clouding my judgment. "
"574540","575600"," So."
"576360","579460"," My thesis and decision making."
"580460","582500"," Was clouded by. "
"583600","586600"," News that wasn't really relevant to make money."
"587140","588140"," To be honest."
"589480","590260"," So. "
"592000","594140"," I pay attention to the news."
"594140","598020"," I do the research where I need to do the research to know what's going on."
"600960","606360"," But I stay away from CNBC oftentimes Bloomberg news all that kind of stuff. "
"607140","608600"," But I did watch a video."
"610500","611000"," Yesterday."
"612340","613240"," Can't find it. "
"613380","613980"," Can't see it here."
"614120","615020"," Now I'm looking for it."
"618120","621040"," It was a long form video on. "
"621780","622720"," To find it here."
"622880","623140"," Yes."
"623300","623460"," Second. "
"628530","630490"," Do, do, do, where is it?"
"639840","642540"," It was a CNBC article about."
"643720","645700"," The rise of zero day training."
"648200","652920"," Selling puts selling calls buying calls buying puts. "
"653500","655580"," Found it fascinating on."
"656400","658860"," A few different different levels."
"660420","661440"," What I really. "
"661700","663440"," So they started out the interview."
"665700","668160"," Talking about selling calls and puts."
"670060","672580"," For a directional swing on the day. "
"674420","678140"," And like you just call the day and that they're going to launch more products."
"678680","679720"," I don't know why I don't see this here."
"679720","680020"," Hold on. "
"699490","700350"," Here we go."
"704150","706410"," I'm going to post a link to it."
"706890","708670"," I'm not going to play it here on stream. "
"710370","714630"," I'm going to post a link to it in the chat for you to click through on."
"714630","717430"," And if you."
"717930","718810"," It's weird. "
"719730","724590"," I was talking about a Tesla bull on Twitter the other day."
"725410","728230"," And he was catching some shit on."
"729190","731270"," He was catching some shit on. "
"732370","733430"," On Twitter."
"734510","736810"," And someone said that."
"737010","738070"," So he was. "
"738470","740450"," Elon Musk was friends with him."
"741050","742990"," I think it was Earl of Frank and Pompey."
"743070","744790"," But I could be wrong on that. "
"745350","746370"," The exact name."
"748050","750510"," Or is Earl of Frank and poppy popular."
"750710","752130"," I fear his name is, but he's good guy. "
"752490","754270"," I think I've actually talked to him."
"755090","757490"," Maybe I think I've talked to him once in real life, but."
"760770","765290"," Someone made a comment that the fall of the Earl of Frank and Pompey. "
"767310","769390"," Was embarrassing his fall of grace."
"770510","773470"," And I've always liked him because he's a very."
"773970","776390"," He's able to read through the bullshit. "
"779050","784650"," He's also he's a guy on Twitter that's not only able to read to the bullshit, but he's."
"785110","786310"," He's able to be."
"787530","792310"," Have different or or not be black and white is decision making. "
"793070","795010"," So this guy is a Tesla bull."
"796010","797950"," But he doesn't drink the Kool-Aid either."
"799950","803750"," Which I like about him because he can he can be the kind of guy that can be like, yeah,"
"803830","806650"," I don't like Elon Musk, but I love Tesla or love SpaceX. "
"807750","810450"," Or I understand the need for Elon Musk."
"812350","819010"," And still dislike things that he does squeezing right now trying to break through these sellers."
"819090","820090"," You see him right here. "
"821690","823010"," Right where we are."
"825250","833710"," And what's what's fascinating is this is you'll see you maybe you maybe even just your."
"835090","837130"," Interactions on social media. "
"837470","840050"," Not everybody can parse truth."
"841490","844510"," That's why we have simple scams, right?"
"844710","844990"," You'll see."
"846270","854690"," You'll see misspellings, some of you out there can figure out when you are contacted for a scam,"
"854990","855150"," right?"
"856150","859530"," Then you'll say, well, why do they speak in English?"
"860810","865370"," And the reason they do that is not because you can understand it. "
"865730","869990"," They're trying to find the person that can't."
"869990","872790"," See the scam simply, right?"
"873170","875950"," You're not trying to target someone that can see a simple scam."
"876390","880890"," Trying to target somebody that can't see a simple scam because it's going to make you easy. "
"881070","882810"," It's going to make it easier for you."
"885250","886450"," Easier for you to."
"887670","890190"," One more one more zone of all right here. "
"894010","897570"," So the idea behind these scams is well, not all of them."
"897650","898590"," There's different kinds of scams."
"899370","903730"," The simple one is you make it simple to see the scam. "
"904170","909630"," So the only people that contact you are the stupidest of stupid people."
"910010","913590"," But you'd be surprised how many people are fucking stupid."
"913590","915790"," That don't mean the English stupid. "
"916090","917530"," I mean, just generally stupid."
"922130","929870"," So when you're watching CNBC, they're not going to get the English level of stupidity across you."
"930330","932110"," So they have to kind of cover it up a little bit. "
"933210","939750"," And I posted this video to you because there's some truth in what these guys are saying."
"939750","949550"," There's a lot of not true in what these guys are saying and trying to parse the truth in this"
"949550","955130"," video is shockingly difficult for most people out there."
"955630","957910"," They did speak some truths. "
"959470","966310"," They're about selling calls and sell the rise of retail selling calls and selling puts on a"
"966310","973230"," directional movement of the S&P 500 or any ETF for one day."
"974090","982350"," And they were discussing, I believe, zero dates for SPX and other funds, which is shocking too."
"983470","985370"," Now, I don't know if they're going to do that. "
"985590","989470"," Was it XSP or what the fuck that ETF is?"
"990050","996150"," I think for all the ETFs, there's already outside of the major indexes."
"997910","1001550"," It's not like you're going to, maybe I guess the spreads are awful as my point."
"1002270","1007570"," So if you take a weekly or monthly out, yeah, you make it a shitty spill and you're spread but"
"1007570","1013530"," you're likely going to be trading that product and not treating it as a zero date except for once a"
"1013530","1013930"," week, right?"
"1014550","1018010"," We talk about that right now in individual tickers. "
"1018190","1022330"," We say, yeah, we get zero date Friday coming up for all these tech stocks."
"1026450","1035930"," Anyways, my point behind this is the one guy's talking about how people are like opening"
"1035930","1045569"," or selling or opening to open or opening to open"
"1045569","1049590"," logs or selling."
"1049910","1050470"," It doesn't matter. "
"1050770","1052210"," It breaks my words up right now."
"1052870","1054150"," You can kind of dig on it myself."
"1055390","1058910"," But like they're selling the market on the open or buying. "
"1059410","1065590"," They're like, okay, they're selling calls or selling puts to open right on the opening bell until"
"1065590","1066790"," the end of the day."
"1067790","1071710"," The one guy was like, no, no, no, that's not what's happening, which I kind of like."
"1071890","1072590"," He was kind of honest. "
"1072770","1076090"," He was like, it's probably just a portion of the day."
"1077430","1080390"," So because when I first heard that I was like, no, no, no."
"1080570","1086310"," I was like, nobody's fucking buying a zero date and holding it from 9.30 until fucking four in the"
"1086310","1092390"," afternoon or selling a call or put until 9.30. So they like, they pass the smell test on that"
"1092390","1092650"," one. "
"1093670","1098770"," But then the other guy goes, well, retailers, they're not selling calls and puts."
"1099310","1102850"," They're buying a zero date call and put options."
"1103090","1105850"," And it's the rise of retail doing this. "
"1107010","1108970"," You know, I got to say something."
"1109150","1114150"," I've been trading zero dates for fucking like eight years at this point."
"1114470","1115170"," Maybe longer. "
"1117430","1121170"," You know, I have pretty fucking a lot of experience."
"1121170","1123310"," You know, think about this."
"1124150","1130510"," If you only trade the best days, even just the past couple of years, two and a half, three years,"
"1131270","1133110"," I've been fucking trading them every day. "
"1133850","1136530"," Every day, good day, bad day, slow day."
"1136650","1137110"," It doesn't matter."
"1137910","1143290"," I literally watch these chains every day and I've been watching them every day for probably coming"
"1143290","1147030"," on a decade, especially the S&P 500 and NASDAQ. "
"1147030","1155810"," Now, there has been a slow progression of using zero dates."
"1156970","1158330"," There you can see a curve."
"1158650","1162150"," I don't have the data in front of me right now, but I have it or had it in the"
"1162150","1162290"," past. "
"1162490","1163070"," Probably find it."
"1163630","1167310"," But you can see the, I guess the CME will likely have that data."
"1167550","1172830"," But you can see this progression of zero dates being used in the indexes. "
"1173930","1178350"," Going back pretty much the past five to seven years or so."
"1179090","1183630"," Now, what's fascinating about this is that is that there's two or three."
"1185290","1188690"," Two or three myths being pushed right now. "
"1189270","1192950"," And one of these myths was pushed in that video from CNBC."
"1195850","1199470"," It's a two part with a really big two parter here."
"1201190","1206970"," Number one, there's been a steady increase of the use of zero dates over the past many years. "
"1207610","1213070"," It's only now becoming glaring because, you know, if you have a steady increase, eventually it does"
"1213070","1213950"," stand out, right?"
"1214490","1218990"," So one year you get, I don't know, a million options traded, then two million, then three, then"
"1218990","1222370"," four, then five and six, then seven hundred million."
"1223750","1226770"," Now in a day, it starts to glare, right?"
"1228370","1230370"," Now, that wasn't from retailers."
"1231030","1231830"," That's part two. "
"1232510","1235090"," And even right now, it's not retailers."
"1237730","1240570"," So you've got, uh, we're coming in some, we're coming up."
"1240830","1242670"," This is the previous high from yesterday. "
"1242670","1246710"," You're going to see a little bit of a pull over here coming up."
"1246750","1248110"," This is where salaries are."
"1248190","1249010"," I just want you to know that. "
"1250370","1252210"," So maybe we'll see it right here."
"1253950","1256110"," Previous high from yesterday."
"1256490","1261510"," And so the point here is this. "
"1262310","1268730"," Oh, the other thing that people will say is, uh, it's, it's retailers that are buying calls all day"
"1268730","1269010"," long."
"1269270","1269530"," Damn it."
"1269950","1271210"," That's not true either. "
"1271230","1276070"," So 2022, uh, the, the gigantic."
"1277470","1279650"," Put our, or, or when we were going down."
"1280390","1285750"," The gigantic, uh, uh, zero date buying was puts, believe it or not. "
"1286290","1287490"," And I mean, like."
"1288750","1290730"," Huge zero date put buying."
"1291150","1295770"," So even if you're going to attest it to, uh, a retailer. "
"1296410","1300490"," Cause there's like an implication that it's bulls dumb bulls doing this."
"1300770","1304530"," And this is how you can see that it's not retailers is my point."
"1305590","1308050"," So they were doing it in 2022. "
"1308710","1309570"," In mass."
"1309990","1312450"," I noticed it in the beginning of 2022 happening."
"1313450","1314770"," We all noticed it. "
"1315590","1320870"," And mostly, or not because it was retailers, but because it just became so huge."
"1320930","1324890"," Like past few years, you'd see like, yeah, a hundred thousand contracts there."
"1325470","1327790"," 200,000 there, maybe three max. "
"1328730","1332730"," Well, 2022 you were seeing four, five, six, seven, 800,000 at a time."
"1333150","1335090"," Now what I also want to say to you is."
"1335970","1339970"," These are not retailers even now, even right now. "
"1340090","1343010"," This is the second part of that argument that's absolutely fucking wrong."
"1343690","1347030"," Uh, I watched these chains all day long."
"1347850","1349570"," Retailers aren't making these traits. "
"1349950","1351030"," I'm not calling up."
"1351150","1356650"," Nobody out there's calling up their local broker and saying, uh, give me 400,000."
"1357050","1361110"," Uh, fucking four, uh, 451 C's right now. "
"1361590","1362910"," That's just not happening."
"1362910","1365230"," And you're not doing it."
"1365410","1366210"," I'm not doing it. "
"1366490","1368250"," No retailers doing this."
"1368470","1371390"," And some days we've got, we've got 400,000."
"1371490","1375730"," And I'm not talking about, um, the OI. "
"1376850","1380090"," That you guys get your data that you get your OI that you get."
"1380090","1384310"," So every morning you wake up and you see what the options chain looks like."
"1384310","1385750"," You see where max pain is. "
"1386090","1388630"," I'm talking about the implied fucking ball for that day."
"1389330","1392810"," I'm talking about the implied move or that the implied move, the implied ball for that day."
"1393250","1397390"," The options, the zero date options that I get and you get, or some of you, some of you get"
"1397390","1400770"," access to, uh, comes out in real time. "
"1400870","1404310"," That's not calculated into your max pain every day."
"1404410","1410030"," But that's not calculated into, uh, any of any of the shit that you're seeing, your gamma that"
"1410030","1412050"," you're seeing, your gex that you're seeing."
"1412630","1413910"," None of that shit's calculated. "
"1414210","1415610"," When you wake up in the morning, you have a cup of coffee."
"1415750","1418270"," You go out there and you're like, that's what's going to happen today."
"1418510","1420770"," Well, and they, they discussed some of this. "
"1420770","1423310"," They discussed some of the impact of this on the marketplace."
"1424810","1431110"," Uh, but I found it fascinating because, or what, what, what we found fascinating was video was, uh,"
"1431230","1433610"," that they're taking notes of this, right?"
"1434530","1436990"," That these ETF, uh, products."
"1437910","1444170"," The people that design run them, manage them are now saying, yeah, we're, we know what's going on"
"1444170","1447210"," and we're blaming retail, which it's not retail. "
"1447210","1449690"," So they get that wrong."
"1451170","1456150"," No, there has been no rise of the retail day trader on SPX and spy."
"1456670","1457770"," It's always been there. "
"1457930","1459070"," It's always been there."
"1459310","1463530"," The other thing that's shocking about this too, the thing that really fucking, the thing that"
"1463530","1467670"," really fucking irks my ass, like blows my ass, burns my ass."
"1468710","1478650"," Is that specifically to myself is, um, what really got me pissed off. "
"1479350","1480610"," Two years ago."
"1481650","1488110"," Like when it really rode my ass was, uh, well, not three years ago in two, in 2020."
"1489030","1491270"," We came into the end of the year. "
"1491810","1496190"," And CNBC was like, uh, as we come into 2021."
"1496790","1502550"," Arcade is a little overbought, but all these other arc products are going to come."
"1502950","1511190"," And so they're basically telling a young trader or a dumb trader, uh, fucking party on in 2021. "
"1511350","1513470"," And we all know what actually happened."
"1513710","1515370"," They sold into you."
"1516030","1521430"," Uh, especially if you're a young trader, if you've maybe had a few years of experience, uh, just"
"1521430","1523990"," bull run experience, that kind of stuff. "
"1524410","1526050"," Meanwhile, the S and P 500."
"1526970","1528490"," Boomed for 2021."
"1528490","1534210"," And it was like a crazy story because it was a tale of three markets. "
"1534850","1541390"," You had spec growth getting annihilated and, uh, people like dead bodies everywhere."
"1542330","1545810"," Then you had a section of doomer bears."
"1546790","1550030"," That were calling for the crash of the S and P 500. "
"1550290","1556170"," And then you had some smart bowls that just rode that shit up for an entire year."
"1556750","1557110"," Right?"
"1557110","1558390"," Smoking doobies."
"1559570","1565310"," Drinking, uh, drinking Louie train, Christo and the market just kept, kept moving higher. "
"1566090","1566230"," Right?"
"1566770","1569870"," Uh, now people were scratching their head about all of this now."
"1570770","1574590"," That's a whole other discussion, but, uh, the point here is this too."
"1574590","1576090"," And how this all rolls into stuff. "
"1576890","1579750"," You also have the end of pit trading."
"1580030","1583130"," You have the end of a phone trading."
"1583410","1586370"," You have like, you have this whole entire rise of AI trading. "
"1586370","1589810"," You have this rise of high frequency trading firms."
"1590170","1592390"," Then now I have the broken out turned into AI."
"1593090","1595850"," You have the end of in person training. "
"1596450","1601110"," Uh, it's really is like you've got people on Webull."
"1601570","1605650"," You got people on Robin Hood and they have, they don't even know what the fuck it is to make"
"1605650","1606750"," a phone call to your broker."
"1607990","1612670"," And you're being like, there's this turn happening out there. "
"1613510","1615990"," There's this like, you don't see it, but I see it."
"1617010","1621210"," You have a, you have a young generation out there of young traders."
"1622230","1628150"," And not right now, but they are being trained for two big things. "
"1628770","1634770"," They're being poisoned with, why do you, you don't need a, you don't need to be able to call your"
"1634770","1635090"," broker."
"1635830","1637730"," You can just trade Robin Hood."
"1639090","1639610"," Right?"
"1640090","1640810"," So you don't need that. "
"1641070","1643710"," If you train an entire generation of young people."
"1644350","1650170"," To think that they don't need to speak to someone on the phone."
"1651390","1653970"," If you teach all of these kids. "
"1656890","1662210"," That's, uh, you know, the best way to do this is with chat GPT on YouTube."
"1662410","1663790"," You see all those videos, right?"
"1664610","1665930"," You automate all your trading."
"1667790","1672110"," And by the way, fuck around with spec growth always, right?"
"1672110","1673710"," There's like all these little things. "
"1674050","1678690"," And meanwhile, don't fucking pay attention to these old traders."
"1679230","1684590"," These old pit traders, these old phone traders, these old market makers."
"1685070","1685930"," Because they're going away. "
"1688350","1689790"," They're old fucks."
"1692070","1692990"," You're a broker."
"1693250","1694710"," You don't need to speak to me as an old fuck. "
"1696850","1698690"," You can automate all this shit."
"1698690","1700710"," You're going to make, you know, 30,000 claims."
"1700710","1702130"," They're like, it's funny too. "
"1702210","1705870"," I just watch the video where all those claims are bullshit, right?"
"1706070","1710170"," The chat GPT, all these language models are actually making money."
"1710310","1711970"," They're not fucking making money."
"1712330","1714010"," I'll get to that video too, if you want. "
"1714390","1717670"," It's like somebody Apple or some guy out there did a whole video on it."
"1718070","1719950"," Now, my point here though is this is that."
"1721550","1726390"," Your whole focus is on all the stuff, but nobody's trading the S&P 500. "
"1726390","1732470"," And you've got a young class of new investors that you don't want them to lose."
"1733270","1737890"," The importance of these things that you don't want them to lose this."
"1738170","1738590"," And so. "
"1739330","1742850"," And there, and there are these old pit traders out there on Finto it, right?"
"1744470","1746050"," And they're getting older."
"1747330","1748810"," You get guys from Bridgewater."
"1749390","1753350"," You got actual people that are actually out there on social media trying to. "
"1754610","1755330"," Unload."
"1757070","1757790"," Knowledge."
"1759230","1760930"," From a different time. "
"1760930","1762570"," Are you talking about like a, a floor."
"1763810","1770370"," On the exchanges that has been like real people trading via a, a, a ticker tape."
"1770770","1773790"," Training via a phone, training via in person. "
"1774270","1775710"," Since time, Memorial."
"1777330","1779010"," And it's all going away."
"1779010","1785490"," And you have the rise of the retailer of the past five or six years, 10 years, let's say. "
"1785990","1786610"," Maybe 2018."
"1787850","1788910"," Maybe not 10 years."
"1789250","1791250"," Or is it eight to whatever that six, seven years, something like that. "
"1791930","1795390"," And meanwhile, you can't have the retail trader."
"1797030","1798110"," Gain any of that knowledge."
"1798330","1800570"," You want that knowledge to get pounded into the ground. "
"1800990","1805610"," You want to bury it and teach these new retailers how to get fucked."
"1808310","1809510"," That's what I would want to do."
"1809590","1811530"," If I was a broker, that's what I would want to do. "
"1811730","1813090"," If I was the owner of."
"1814250","1815510"," The trading platform."
"1816130","1817190"," That's what I would want to do. "
"1817190","1818890"," If I was anyone on Wall Street."
"1819730","1822930"," I'd want to create a class of retail trader."
"1823350","1824590"," That's dumb as fuck. "
"1825130","1826850"," So I can take their money from them."
"1827350","1829470"," You need to fuel my marketplace."
"1830650","1832350"," I'm the professional, right?"
"1832350","1838830"," And so what happens is. "
"1840790","1842090"," You know, they don't like that."
"1842790","1844490"," And you see that."
"1844710","1847350"," You see that aggression towards that. "
"1847670","1851690"," And the reason I'm bringing that up is because you've got people out there trying to."
"1852010","1853530"," Trying to information dump."
"1853890","1855730"," You'll see a floor trader as an example. "
"1856010","1859350"," You might have like a pit trader like a guy like Jim or a guy like Jedi."
"1860830","1863870"," Out there and these guys lived this life."
"1864290","1868490"," They were taught by multi generations before them. "
"1870010","1873670"," Key insights into the market that will still be there."
"1873790","1877470"," Even if they computerize all this stuff, even if they use AI."
"1878170","1879750"," These are all important things, right?"
"1880230","1884750"," Important information, important knowledge that needs to be passed along. "
"1884750","1889250"," Then you have an idea that the S&P 500 and then you suck right out of your socks."
"1890270","1893950"," So you're going to follow these young kids are going to focus on all the shiny rocks out there."
"1894230","1895670"," You're going to go trade out. "
"1895670","1895990"," I don't know."
"1896430","1899350"," BBBY and AMC and Tesla."
"1899950","1901050"," But the truth is. "
"1901870","1908530"," You need these young people to learn to like if you're a young trader, you need to master."
"1909290","1910050"," The indexes."
"1910050","1917010"," So that you can then apply those things to number one, you can always come back to them to trade"
"1917010","1919710"," them if you ever need to like in 2021. "
"1922610","1928330"," You can have a base understanding of the mechanics of the marketplace because of the sectors that"
"1928330","1933990"," are underneath these indexes or the major holdings of these indexes."
"1933990","1943110"," And then you've got an older class of traders of these products that are going away."
"1943790","1949930"," So you have to funnel them to these people so that all this information that is being dumped right"
"1949930","1955730"," now is retained by a new class of trader and investor. "
"1955730","1961440"," And they don't want you."
"1961560","1967580"," If you're young listening to me or watching me right now, I assure you that they don't want that"
"1967580","1970340"," education passed along to you when you're young."
"1970760","1972880"," They want you to be a dumb fucking trader. "
"1974160","1976880"," In truthfully years ago, there were message boards."
"1977180","1979420"," Once the internet got big enough AOL."
"1980180","1980660"," Yahoo. "
"1981120","1981720"," There's another one."
"1981860","1982600"," I forget the name of it."
"1986120","1992440"," But retailers were like had this huge movement in the age of the internet and they're all starting"
"1992440","1993120"," to age out. "
"1993720","1998780"," And all these guys are women, men, women, whoever they are, they're out there dropping this"
"1998780","2001660"," knowledge on younger generations."
"2002200","2004840"," And it's not like they're going to scream for you to pick it up."
"2004980","2005760"," They're just going to dump it. "
"2006180","2007380"," And if you find it and use it."
"2008560","2009380"," So be it."
"2014080","2016660"," And this stuff needs to be passed along. "
"2017700","2019980"," You don't want this stuff to be lost."
"2020900","2024740"," If you're a young trader, you want to learn investor, you want to learn this stuff."
"2026640","2028540"," So you can put it into your toolbox. "
"2029180","2032340"," One day you're going to be the old woman, you're going to be the old man."
"2035800","2039100"," And you're going to have to pass that along to the next generation."
"2041380","2045860"," It'll serve you well as you in your trading career. "
"2046700","2050440"," And eventually you're going to need to pass that along to the next generation."
"2050920","2052900"," Some kid out there that's 10 years old."
"2053620","2055580"," Not another decade from now. "
"2055719","2057100"," They're going to be 20, 22."
"2058500","2059820"," And they're going to be teased."
"2061159","2063719"," And told you want to buy the shiny rock over there. "
"2064580","2066219"," And they're going to get sold into it."
"2066219","2070420"," And they're going to get beat up and they're going to get torched over and over and over."
"2074340","2078260"," And you have to be the one to take that torch from those guys. "
"2078760","2082540"," Now, the reason I'm saying all this is because in that video yesterday."
"2083440","2087320"," There was just the one I posted just now, there was some discussion."
"2090120","2091860"," About having to. "
"2093400","2098400"," Manipulate the if if there's a rise of retailers learning how to trade the indexes."
"2099500","2101260"," But they like the zero dates."
"2103660","2108380"," And they're going to all learn how to trade the S&P 500 or NASDAQ or I W M whatever"
"2108380","2109100"," the fuck it is. "
"2109220","2110280"," They're going to S P X."
"2110600","2111340"," I don't know what it is."
"2111500","2117500"," They're trying to guess that there was like big discussion about not all of the ETFs have zero"
"2117500","2117760"," dates."
"2117860","2118820"," They want to put them everywhere. "
"2118820","2121340"," I want to put fucking zero dates probably on Tesla."
"2126600","2129240"," But how they were going to deal."
"2129620","2132920"," This was the key point in that conversation they had them CNBC was. "
"2133320","2139360"," Well, okay, if these retailers really like these products and we're going to run zero dates on"
"2139360","2139600"," them."
"2140340","2147120"," How do we manipulate them so that so a professional can actually sell calls and puts."
"2147880","2150840"," And make money off of these sucker. "
"2151740","2158180"," That's by retailers buying calls to open and puts to open."
"2160060","2164200"," And so I found that video from two days ago quite fascinating."
"2164520","2165980"," There are some key points in there. "
"2166300","2168920"," There's a lot of bullshit weaved into it too."
"2169640","2170580"," So it's like some truth."
"2171040","2173940"," There's some there's some bullshit fake shit in there. "
"2174540","2178380"," And then there's how do we how do we fuck over the retailers that are in there too."
"2179100","2182580"," It's fascinating is that video came up two days ago and yesterday's options chain."
"2182960","2183840"," I was like man. "
"2184500","2187920"," I was like they really are trying to look at my my my shit's all back."
"2188220","2189060"," Well fuck yeah."
"2190480","2193340"," Sweet sweet my calls are looking good again. "
"2193340","2193960"," All right."
"2194580","2196820"," And they put look like shit but they were five cents."
"2197480","2199700"," They were like three cents on the opening bell this morning. "
"2199820","2203000"," I was like you burned me for half my half my puts this morning."
"2203000","2204940"," My calls are doing good though."
"2208020","2213460"," So I'm fascinated by this whole of this dynamic that's coming into the marketplace. "
"2214160","2215180"," And I'll be honest with you."
"2215520","2216380"," I'm going to tell you something."
"2216840","2218420"," There's fucking nobody out there. "
"2219020","2222560"," So for for every Jedi Marcus out there."
"2222680","2224920"," There's I don't know."

"11275690","11282770"," one more time all the way up failure and then this is the money trade when i say money trade"
"11282770","11290310"," to you what i mean to you is this is the safest part of the trade this is where the"
"11290310","11298150"," safest money is same thing goes for bulls you could turn this trade upside down and your safest"
"11298150","11305930"," trade like the like the one where you make the most guaranteed money like like i'm guaranteeing 65"
"11305930","11312350"," to 85 percent of the time but that's going to be a printer does that make sense to you now"
"11312350","11316950"," you'll see a lot of guys they'll be like nope i sold it here i sold it here i'm a"

"11331750","11340490"," gets reversed and you wind it daily lose like you lose this trade so it reverses to the upside and"
"11340490","11346230"," they're getting their asses handed to them this is like 70 percent of the time make sense so like"
"11346230","11353170"," the best part of your trades are here and here um and watch waiting for the setup to take it"
"11353170","11360830"," short same thing goes with calls if this chart was flipped upside down right now right a bull would"
"11360830","11367790"," have lost here he would have lost here and you're you're then waiting for the confirmation to the"
"11367790","11373110"," upside does that make sense so if a bull was buying a dip right here he would have lost bull"
"11373110","11378850"," was buying a dip right here he would have lost third one was the charm right but he's lost he's"
"11378850","11388570"," lost now 60 percent of his trades you understand what i'm saying"
"11388570","11396270"," flip this chart upside down right now um does that make sense so losing trade losing trade winning"
"11396270","11404490"," trade that means that bull is a winner 30 percent of the time not 60 not 80 right so so"
"11404490","11409950"," this could continue higher and that bull is now a hundred percent loser on the day when this was"
"11409950","11416450"," the actual dip to buy does that make sense so these are like the high probability uh banking trades"
"11416450","11426410"," so for me for me right now uh you saw the reversal on Nasdaq right now it's trying to confirm"
"11426410","11432810"," the move lower uh this is setting up to roll over so it's looking it's like starting to look"

"11911500","11921640"," want to put some risk in something that can move um so you're trying to go for spec growth tickers"
"11921640","11930440"," right uh so like so here's an example so i'm not putting risk on options uh on like high risk"
"11930440","11941860"," high reward on spy or on let's say um a meme stock like AMC so"
"11941860","11948760"," my point here is you have to have a blend right so so on this blend uh i want to"
"11948760","11958760"," buy a safe ticker like Budweiser but i want it to outperform like i was trading um an AMC or"
"11958760","11968720"," something so what do you do you look for a ticker that is spec growth you look for something"
"11968720","11975280"," that has IPO'd or right now specifically in time you're looking for something that's IPO'd in the"
"11975280","11982220"," last three years so there's potential for growth in the price of the stock you're looking to enter"
"11982220","11990100"," before it becomes a meme stock so think about GME uh illiquid it was the liquid one time that that"
"11990100","11998400"," options chain was illiquid right um so i'm looking to put some some risk on this ticker i'm looking"
"11998400","12004140"," for something that's spec growth i'm looking for something that's been repriced from covid to the"

"12027860","12036040"," some of them are going to have liquid liquid options chains some of them are not so the concept"
"12036040","12041280"," here would be i'm going to buy if it's an illiquid options chain i'm probably going to buy the"
"12041280","12050420"," underlying and then i'm likely going to look for some nice round numbers and if there's no interest"
"12050420","12057620"," in any of those down the road one two three six nine months down the road maybe i start a"
"12057620","12064180"," position there maybe i'd begin maybe i look at a maybe i look at like a hashie corp or the"
"12064180","12074020"," question was about which ticker are you asking about you're asking about um there it is baby you"
"12074020","12079500"," see it you see the dirty you see the dirty uh who is asking about that career law was asking"

"16414250","16418830"," Oh, yeah, I got a shit ton of deleted tweets from taking along into the clothes yesterday."
"16420430","16423730"," Oh, I pissed off people in that clothes yesterday, huh?"
"16435950","16440830"," I'm looking at that post that fucking bell yesterday and I pissed off people. "
"16453599","16454660"," My sweat now."
"16454860","16455259"," Fuck no."
"16455880","16456740"," Yeah, they're deleting. "
"16456800","16460220"," They deleted a bunch of comments on my post from yesterday."
"16461400","16462840"," Some people left them up."
"16463000","16464720"," I appreciate you if you leave them up. "
"16465640","16467980"," Some people left up some bearish comments."
"16469340","16470640"," But some people deleted."
"16471279","16472560"," You always check back and see. "
"16489180","16490300"," Yeah, that's cheap."

"16514480","16516419"," I'm going to let these fuckers burn one way or another."
"16516580","16516919"," I don't care. "
"16519279","16520939"," Long four fifty five C."
"16522860","16525500"," For a trade and failure before our three."
"16542150","16543890"," Yeah, I'm on that trade right now."
"16547349","16550950"," Yeah, dude, it's we don't just talking to so yet. "
"16551090","16554070"," I was just talking to Joe about this on the phone."
"16555150","16557430"," I was like, like, I'm head."
"16557730","16559410"," So like I have underlying in the market. "
"16560189","16562009"," So I have to have a choice."
"16563189","16565210"," So like I have to buy puts the heads."
"16565210","16566710"," You got to buy five cent fucking puts. "
"16568730","16573070"," And then I'm still trading the market up right with options and underlying."
"16575230","16580650"," So, you know, we're in that motion right where you're well hedged and then you're making so much"
"16580650","16581910"," fucking money that."
"16583009","16588150"," No, seriously trading eleven cents right now on four fifty five C's. "
"16588950","16591910"," Fourteen cents fifteen cents."
"16593189","16606080"," I took fourteen"
"16606080","16607460"," cents just then."
"16608000","16609140"," I'm flat again. "
"16625130","16636490"," See if"
"16636490","16637610"," you can jump out of one more time."

"16684119","16684540"," Missed estimates. "
"16684779","16685720"," I'm sure it is an outputty price."
"16685840","16686800"," Jesus point high."
"16687040","16692060"," It's the door for still holding the calls from yesterday and then improving economic picture. "
"16692200","16693759"," Yes, sit down financial juice."

"16820770","16822130"," I just missed an entry. "
"16822330","16823170"," Hold on a second here."
"16823730","16824670"," I'm not going to buy."
"16824790","16825530"," Am I just buying it?"
"16825630","16826150"," Say fuck it. "
"16826330","16826550"," All right."
"16828730","16830130"," All right, back in again."
"16832370","16833630"," I shouldn't be it. "
"16833650","16834110"," This is bad."

"16835310","16836750"," I get a bad position together. "
"16836910","16837570"," It doesn't matter."

"16880660","16885620"," Look at that. "
"16937000","16937980"," Oh, man, dude."
"16939800","16940520"," Four 55s."
"16940560","16948580"," All right. "
"16948680","16949220"," You want some music?"
"16949480","16950720"," Oh, I don't want to get some music."
"16950720","16951360"," Hold on."
"16952520","16953040"," Hold on. "
"16953140","16953640"," I got some music."
"16953800","16954100"," I don't know."
"16954220","16957560"," Let me see if I can get some music here. "
"16964740","16967100"," You know what?"
"16968820","16971360"," We'll give some props out there right now."
"16972600","16975720"," They haven't heard it in a while, so we'll play it for the bears."
"16976980","17013030"," Oh, no,"
"17013150","17014890"," this is the pain trade for the bears. "
"17015230","17015590"," Trust me."
"17015710","17017390"," They don't want to hear this right now."
"17017530","17018950"," We're in a pain trade up here. "
"17019510","17024170"," Now trading 15 and 14 cents on 455 C's."
"17026390","17029110"," Dixie rolling over right now."
"17051190","17052270"," Moon it, baby. "
"17078490","17086230"," Joe Donut chiming in, letting everybody know that it is now 2.30. We'll usually see an extension on"
"17086230","17091590"," the 2.30 hour to 2.40. But if this is a place where you want to take the money,"
"17091770","17094170"," don't hesitate to take the money and run."
"17095050","17099650"," Nobody, nobody out there should ever feel bad for taking profit."
"17100150","17103570"," 45 straight and 17 cents right now. "
"17104070","17108770"," I am still long into 2.40 this afternoon."
"17111090","17112490"," Maybe you're right, Joey."
"17112670","17114510"," They're only going 18 cents right now. "
"17115430","17116690"," Come on, baby."
"17116870","17119770"," Give me that big old push up."
"17125020","17130440"," Taking the money on 19 cents right now on 455 C."
"17131220","17134960"," I was going to let it run and then I'm thinking about Joe Harper being the voice of reason right"
"17134960","17135280"," now. "
"17139300","17141620"," Joe Harper's being the voice of reason in the background."
"17142000","17142660"," So I'm like, you know what?"
"17142720","17144680"," I'll give him a little bit of love there."
"17145680","17146840"," I can't say it. "
"17146880","17150260"," I can't say that I'm not going to listen to him."
"17152940","17154460"," There's my favorite French fuse."
"17155540","17157100"," That one right there. "
"17157960","17158360"," Pulls."
"17158540","17159700"," This one's for you."
"17291160","17292020"," I took it off. "
"17292160","17293720"," I took it off there, Joey."
"17294500","17295240"," I'm fine right now."
"17316300","17317040"," I'm good, man. "
"17317180","17317440"," I'm cool."
"17445830","17448890"," All right, so I'm going to be looking to make an entry in here."
"17449150","17450510"," So I'm writing this out right here. "
"17450630","17453330"," Entry and then DCA down here, right?"
"17453830","17458710"," Now, if you're like a safety trainer, you'll have your entry right here, right?"
"17458930","17460610"," If you missed the trade, you missed the trade."
"17468340","17471400"," All right, I'm long now, 455 C's."
"17472960","17478820"," If I have to DCA down below, if this rolls down a little bit more and I have to add"
"17478820","17485340"," again to the trade, I will, but I am long once more on 455 C's for the target above. "
"17486820","17490080"," I want to see fucking R3 get tagged."
"17490640","17491900"," So I am long right now."
"17494320","17498880"," I want to see R3 get tagged into tomorrow for Vixpiration. "
"17501940","17504940"," Now, if you're a new trader, you might want to be down here."
"17505420","17512480"," If we go up and you miss it all shucks, you want to be like a safer trader and you"
"17512480","17513500"," want to wait for down here."
"17514100","17519860"," So for me, I have started another position and I'm going to DCA over here somewhere. "
"17519860","17525200"," If we still roll down, there could be an opportunity here, like this rolls up."
"17525520","17528280"," You get a little bit of a failure candle with a green candle."
"17531000","17532940"," Create that up with a failure. "
"17533640","17534940"," Come back down over here."
"17536440","17538420"," You might catch it right there."
"17542450","17543350"," Make sense?"
"17544470","17545030"," 238. "
"17546530","17549090"," Now, normally it's like the 240 hour."
"17550110","17552790"," I still feel as though this is usually pretty bullish."
"17553730","17554770"," 3PM, you figure. "
"17555330","17557890"," We got until basically 3PM, we got 20 minutes here."
"17558670","17560170"," So we got 20 minutes for a trade."
"17561590","17563710"," We'll see if it's going to go back up again. "
"17565450","17568610"," Sitting on some 455s once again."
"17570370","17573390"," So we'll see how this happens, how this rolls right here."
"17573390","17575790"," First entry, DCA right in here. "
"17583800","17594700"," Oh, you're"
"17594700","17595200"," welcome, BB."
"17595460","17595900"," Killer dabs."
"17597340","17599520"," Let me see. "
"17603500","17605880"," Yeah, so Tesla's price target."
"17606180","17608820"," You guys want the price target for today on Tesla?"
"17609100","17609800"," Hold on a second here."
"17614140","17615700"," I got here. "
"17629480","17634360"," So Tesla's trading, currently trading 292 in some change."
"17635680","17637860"," 292.50. Ready for this?"
"17639000","17641580"," It has not tagged its upper bound yet."
"17642800","17645520"," So it's first price target on Tesla. "
"17646000","17646680"," You guys want it?"
"17646680","17647380"," Hold on here."
"17647380","17648020"," We'll do it right here."
"17651300","17652160"," So Tesla. "
"17653100","17656200"," This is the Tesla chart for you if you don't already know."
"17656880","17659560"," We haven't even hit our targets yet for today."
"17660460","17661980"," I'm going to give them to you right now. "
"17661980","17672180"," For today, you've got 293 right there,"
"17672820","17673260"," 88."
"17683280","17709180"," Then you've got a, you have 293, 88, they got 297, 39, 302, 54."
"17710080","17716920"," I doubt you get this one, but I don't think it's unreasonable for you to get this one right here. "
"17727680","17729480"," So that's Tesla into the bell."
"17730320","17733060"," Even though it's looking a little vicious right here, a little painful."
"17734300","17736440"," I'm going to have to add my calls here in just a minute. "
"17737040","17737540"," Hold on here."
"17740420","17742060"," My DCA is down here."
"17744420","17747040"," I got my entry price right here at 9 cents. "
"17747260","17748720"," I'm going to be looking to add down here."
"17749620","17758540"," Let me ask you, this is a good way to, this is a good way right now too."
"17758860","17759460"," So let's look at something. "
"17759760","17761700"," So I'm in for 9 cents right here, right?"
"17763160","17764200"," So I'm in for 9."
"17765800","17768600"," And they're currently trading for 7 right now."
"17769900","17777320"," So if I were to DCA right here, can we continue to roll them kind of fucked, right?"
"17777320","17781640"," I need like, if it comes back into 9, it's no big deal, right?"
"17781880","17783360"," I'm still, I'm still flat."
"17784040","17791300"," If it rolls down here and hits 5 though, or 4, I can actually just do one more DCA and"
"17791300","17792520"," have a really nice entry. "
"17793540","17798660"," So, so like entry DCA matters like where that is matters."
"17799180","17799700"," Does that make sense?"
"17800400","17805800"," Instead of just like DCAing this, it's like right now I'm back up to 8 cents."
"17805800","17808480"," So now I'm down a penny, right?"
"17808860","17816420"," So, so my point here is you don't need to like, you don't need, like you have an entry here"
"17816420","17818360"," and then you have a DCA right here. "
"17818400","17820920"," Wherever this white line is, to make sense."
"17821380","17824020"," So you're not like DCAing here."
"17824880","17828980"," Your entry is here for the 6 CMA and your DCA is down here. "
"17829640","17830220"," Does it make sense?"
"17830220","17835240"," So, like if I DCAed 7 and 9 cents, does it really matter?"
"17835660","17836280"," Probably not."
"17837200","17843040"," If it were to, let's say I did DCA 7 and 9, or 9 cents and 7 cents and then"
"17843040","17848680"," we rolled back down to 5 cents, I would likely have to triple down, right?"
"17848920","17850700"," Even if my belief is that we're going higher."
"17851460","17856620"," So why not just make the 9 cent trade and then the 5 cent trade down here?"
"17857840","17861480"," As a matter of fact, I'm going to be flat here in just a second. "
"17862140","17864360"," So I'm right back where I bought the dip right here."
"17865080","17867000"," We're right where my original thesis was."
"17867500","17870140"," We haven't come down to the DCA point down here. "
"17870220","17871440"," I just want to give you a heads up on that."
"17872200","17875260"," Because yesterday we had some questions about where to DCA."
"17875600","17876720"," Where do you buy the clothes?"
"17877440","17878880"," Like you have to have a plan, right?"
"17879360","17880220"," Like I'm buying this. "
"17880720","17884820"," This is where my DCA is and then I've got to stop below it if we have a reversal at"
"17884820","17885240"," any points."
"17885780","17891280"," And even if we have a reversal to the downside, let's say we reverse right now, right?"
"17891580","17893200"," Let's say we did have a reversal right now."
"17894280","17895500"," And we roll, right?"
"17895640","17896560"," I buy the DCA. "
"17896640","17897400"," I DCA here."
"17897500","17897580"," Boom."
"17897740","17898080"," My bottom. "
"17898480","17900320"," I get trapped in that, right?"
"17901800","17906480"," And we squeeze up with purple, right?"
"17907220","17909020"," So let's say I buy this DCA, right?"
"17909020","17912200"," And let's say I'm buying this or it's green, 10, that's green, right?"
"17912660","17914640"," And it immediately reverses on me."
"17915460","17917980"," And now I'm like, oh shit, I'm losing money."
"17918160","17919480"," My calls are worth three cents. "
"17919880","17928160"," There's likely going to be a chance for me still to get out of whatever I was in over here."
"17928380","17929080"," Does that make sense?"
"17930340","17933300"," So, you know, right now, this is my plan, right?"
"17933540","17935760"," And my plan is fucking working right now."
"17935760","17944680"," And not only is my plan working, but if I lose, I have an opportunity to unbuck myself, right?"
"17944840","17947680"," I'm not selling the capitulation red bar down. "
"17948380","17951920"," I'm actually waiting for one more green up to then exit."
"17952480","17956540"," So let's say I'm in for nine cents and five cents."
"17957160","17959400"," My DCA is now seven cents, right?"
"17960220","17963080"," And so then we have that last green bar up. "
"17963080","17968920"," I'm able to skim a penny or two to offset my original buy-in, right?"
"17969500","17971900"," And I'm managing my trade."
"17972780","17981860"," So a winner to me is if we go up here and even if we roll, even if we roll,"
"17982520","17987540"," that I DCA'd and then caught the green bar back up to unfuck myself."
"17988180","17988960"," Does that make sense?"
"17989640","17990020"," So here. "
"17990680","17993480"," Does this make sense to everybody watching right now?"
"17996180","17998320"," Does that make sense to any of you?"
"18000400","18001240"," That's right."

"18312150","18316730"," I have to take my wife and kids, so my children are homeschooled."

"18325610","18328490"," Now, it's not like a full trading week."
"18328710","18334350"," It's kind of a weird one, like take the Friday off or something, and then Monday, Tuesday."
"18335170","18343570"," I'll get you the exact dates, but I'm taking my wife and children snorkeling and a week for a bunch"
"18343570","18347650"," of water sport crap at someplace called Higgins Lake. "
"18348250","18351550"," It's like the Bermuda of Michigan supposedly."
"18351950","18357570"," It's five most beautiful lakes in the country, and so I'm taking them there camping."
"18358610","18362050"," All that camping stuff that I was setting up, that's what this trip is for. "
"18363230","18369150"," I do want to make you aware that next week heading into that closing weekend, I want to make you"
"18369150","18372190"," aware that I will not, I don't think I'll be here that Friday."
"18372450","18373230"," I might be here."
"18373670","18375230"," I'll check the exact dates. "
"18375710","18381370"," I'll get firm dates for you for when I exactly go and do that, but I want you to be"
"18381370","18383030"," aware of it as we come into next Friday."
"18386230","18387110"," Thanks, Blissawix."
"18387450","18388650"," I appreciate that, my brother. "
"18390870","18392310"," Yeah, Higgins Lake, man."
"18392430","18393050"," I've never been."
"18394650","18395630"," I've never been. "
"18395790","18403050"," I've never been to Higgins Lake, so I'm doing Higgins Lake for, I'm doing Higgins Lake for, the"
"18403050","18412490"," clearest lake I've been to here has been, I was on an island in Lake Superior in the fall, and"
"18412490","18414290"," I couldn't believe how clear it was."
"18414710","18422370"," It was like glass, but supposedly this is like gin tonic waters, and so we're going to go do a"
"18422370","18423910"," bunch of stuff up there."
"18423910","18432350"," We're going to do a powerboat rental and snorkeling and all kinds of cool stuff. "
"18432550","18439190"," They've got boat wrecks in there, I guess, that you can snorkel like old 1970s, boat wrecks and"
"18439190","18439870"," stuff like that."
"18441710","18442690"," Yeah, I've never been."
"18443610","18445070"," I love you too, Blissawix. "
"18445630","18446170"," I love you, brother."
"18449770","18451130"," I've been to Torch Lake."
"18451610","18456870"," I have done Torch Lake, so this will be the first time for Higgins for me. "
"18459030","18460170"," Can I go over to Baba?"
"18460270","18460430"," Yes."
"18463690","18465630"," Let me check out Baba for you real quick."
"18472290","18473210"," I'll go over Baba. "
"18473350","18474210"," I should go over Baba."
"18474290","18474590"," Here we go."
"18474690","18475470"," We're going to do Baba. "
"18475530","18475770"," It's important."
"18476170","18477810"," I am long right now, just so you know."
"18478650","18483090"," If anybody's wondering as I go over Baba, I am long for this trade up right here. "
"18483090","18485430"," I got six minutes, basically."
"18485930","18487150"," So I got six more minutes."
"18487150","18491230"," If I can't get a new high here in the next six minutes, I'm going to wrap it up. "
"18492150","18496510"," So I'm going to do a two minute review of Baba."
"18496890","18500450"," If you are a Baba trader, we're going to talk about it."
"18502470","18512290"," Now, I am bullish Baba with that said, with that said, prices below the hourly right now. "
"18512290","18512930"," You see that?"
"18513610","18517190"," You're looking for the cross right here for an explosive move."
"18518230","18521010"," So I want it right where we are."
"18521010","18521950"," I want it to hold. "
"18529770","18536590"," Whenever we get these crosses here, what happens if this holds, if we get this cross of the DT,"
"18537270","18540530"," even though it's rolling over, the hourly looks good here."
"18541090","18542850"," So what I want to say to you is this."
"18543290","18545590"," I'm expecting Baba. "
"18545590","18547150"," I only got five minutes left."
"18550110","18555650"," To have some still some consolidation, this thing is going to moon."
"18557910","18559650"," Like straight moon. "
"18567310","18568310"," Hundred bucks."
"18568650","18571070"," First price target, hundred bucks on Baba."
"18573960","18577560"," But then 101, this is a lot of volatility in here too. "
"18577560","18579780"," Your real target is a hundred bucks."
"18580100","18582860"," After this though, you start moving higher and higher and higher."
"18583720","18587160"," But your real target here is a hundred bucks right there. "
"18588000","18591460"," I'd look for a capitulation moment possibly on it."
"18591860","18596160"," The market itself is getting a little toppy here on Baba."
"18596420","18602260"," So what I want to say to you is you might not think it can happen, but let's say you"
"18602260","18610300"," have like a bloodbath tomorrow in the morning and we had a moment you could buy Baba at like 8750. "
"18610960","18613160"," Then I would say yes."
"18613600","18614640"," So it's complicated."
"18615180","18618960"," So here, I'm going to come back over here and talk about Baba once more because I need to be"
"18618960","18621400"," very precise in what I say to you. "
"18621660","18621940"," You ready?"
"18622980","18628840"," So right now I'm bullish on Baba to 9210."
"18630060","18630620"," Okay."
"18630940","18634400"," If Baba breaks below 89, 89, I'm not a buyer. "
"18634840","18636740"," Breaks below 88, 79, I'm not a buyer."
"18637720","18644180"," I would be looking for at least the hourly to swing down and kind of grab it and bring it"
"18644180","18644660"," back up."
"18645200","18646480"," And then it would be a buyer. "
"18646980","18648200"," But I am bullish here."
"18648520","18651660"," My only concern is where Nasdaq is right now."
"18652060","18653840"," It's trading 15, 872. "
"18654360","18657840"," I think it's a local top for Nasdaq."
"18657840","18660040"," Nasdaq at 16,000."
"18660260","18665980"," If that's the case, though, you see how you have a capitulation move, capitulation move back here?"
"18666560","18669620"," You know, if you have like a shocker, how much time do I have left here?"
"18670860","18676360"," If you have like a shocker here where it's like just quick bloodbath, then it comes back up and"
"18676360","18676960"," goes higher. "
"18677200","18680220"," Just like keep a stink bid down here on Baba."
"18680740","18682160"," Very bullish here to go up."
"18682520","18687200"," Just note that, you know, you have like, you have that like four o'clock in the morning fucking"
"18687200","18689180"," through the 2.30 in the afternoon or something. "
"18689880","18691140"," You get a quick move down."
"18691300","18692480"," You're off and running to the upside."
"18693260","18699080"," Price target 101.46. Draw or vol at 97.69 on it. "
"18699680","18701080"," But yes, I agree with you."
"18701340","18703840"," It is, I agree with you."
"18703880","18706420"," It's very bullish here and dangerous. "
"18707360","18709940"," If you had enough time on the trade, no big deal."
"18711980","18717510"," Good call out on Baba."
"18729710","18732450"," Yeah, I'm still in on calls right now. "
"18732450","18733270"," Haven't sold anything."
"18735270","18739150"," 258, two minutes left for bulls to get one more bar."
"18739350","18740710"," They got one more bar to get a new high. "
"18741450","18742330"," No new high."
"18742450","18743170"," I'm going to have to cut them loose."
"18748690","18750390"," Bulls have one more bar. "
"18750590","18750970"," That's it."
"18758250","18759730"," We're fired out right now."
"18760890","18761970"," Dixie's rolling over. "
"18762270","18765590"," We're going to get a test real quick on Nasdaq and find out what's happening."
"18766250","18769050"," Apple is straight mooning right now."
"18770410","18771910"," Straight mooning right now. "
"18777180","18779260"," I think I'm just going to hold these into the bell."
"18779440","18779780"," You know what?"
"18780620","18782120"," I don't care if they go to zero."
"18782900","18783980"," I'm not fucking selling them. "
"18785080","18786980"," I want to see this happen into the bell."
"18787200","18790400"," I want to see like, I want to see Nasdaq hit 16,000."
"18790400","18792300"," I want to see Apple near 200. "
"18794240","18796780"," We keep fucking, we keep Dixie's in this."
"18802550","18803470"," Red on Henry."
"18804050","18810230"," Yeah, I would say to you if you're in Baba, I guess I would, I guess I'd preface this with"
"18810230","18815590"," if you're a long Baba and there's a momentary like, like bloodbath down. "
"18815890","18817250"," I wouldn't be too concerned."
"18817670","18820110"," I would be like, yeah, just diamond hand that shit."
"18823170","18826570"," You know, I would like if Bob had like, oh my God, doom. "
"18827670","18832670"," You get a correction or something in the market and I want to tell you guys something too."
"18833050","18834550"," I want to be very clear with you."
"18835670","18840890"," If you are along the markets and we get a correction, but like, write this shit down. "
"18840990","18847110"," If we get a correction and you panic cell, like a week later, we're up."
"18847290","18848190"," We're right where we started."
"18848950","18850830"," There's a there's some math in this. "
"18852590","18854250"," There's some big math here."
"18854470","18862690"," So if we correct like more than seven or eight percent, you likely have another opportunity to get"
"18862690","18867070"," out of a long position in case we actually rolled the entire market down."
"18867110","18872590"," You know, like a bloodbath 10, 12, 20 or the or the run is over or something like that. "
"18872870","18876270"," If we get a correction, we usually come back up."
"18876270","18884030"," So make sure you're managing your fear when we do correct or even the market rolls over is my"
"18884030","18884330"," point."
"18884870","18886970"," You normally have a chance to get out. "
"18888110","18894490"," There's ample there's ample time for you to not be a panic seller bull."
"18896350","18900410"," There's ample time for you normally have time to sell."
"18900410","18906790"," Yeah, I can't. "
"18906850","18907050"," I keep."
"18907150","18908130"," I say Wednesday again."
"18909150","18925350"," Yeah, I'm"
"18925350","18926550"," going to do diamond hands in this clothes. "
"18926710","18927390"," I'm going to buy this."
"18927530","18928510"," I'm going to buy all this too."
"18930510","18932270"," I just got my sixth sense here. "
"18932310","18933730"," So I'm going to add to my position here."
"18934990","18935670"," Hold on here."
"18937750","18939190"," You didn't get one more penny out of this. "
"18945100","18949000"," Or do I move up to four fifty fours to add the four fifty four maybe."
"18951340","18954600"," We're getting a little little little little little little roll here."
"18954720","18958320"," Come back down and check the fifteen eight thirty one. "
"18958560","18960000"," I mean, I'm going to cool off here."
"18960340","18962600"," I'm going to leave the four fifty fives on not sell them."
"18962820","18965840"," And I'm going to look to buy four fifty fours. "
"18967060","18970720"," As soon as we come down and tag eight thirty one on ndx."
"18974140","18977100"," They're going to try to attempt to not print these four fifty fives."
"18977140","18977820"," They can already see it. "
"18978600","18980020"," They're going to try to send them to zero."
"18980900","18982520"," You're going to try to snatch that money."
"18984640","18985920"," No, no, not that many. "

"19137730","19139050"," possible squeeze higher."
"19140990","19144230"," So we're coming into like a sideways trade in the market. "
"19144710","19146630"," It's not so much we start selling."

"19207330","19208950"," We normally trade above that."
"19209690","19211030"," A little bit."
"19211550","19211710"," So. "

"19237350","19238550"," It's kind of important here."

"19262490","19263690"," This is 4615."
"19265290","19266770"," We have an expectation."
"19268550","19270650"," With this quarter to trade. "
"19274390","19275090"," SPX."
"19276130","19278950"," We have an expectation for this quarter to tag here."
"19280430","19283570"," My target for the quarter 4717. "
"19284410","19285150"," There I said it."
"19288430","19289890"," Maybe right here."
"19290030","19293570"," I'll give two targets 4707 4717. "
"19296430","19297750"," At least for the quarter."
"19298590","19299590"," So with that said."
"19301330","19302290"," Holy shit. "
"19302590","19303710"," Keep on printing, baby."
"19304430","19305630"," Keep on printing."
"19306370","19309210"," So with that said, right for the for for the quarter expectations. "
"19310430","19313570"," We should still get a pullback in here too, right?"
"19314370","19314930"," You know what I'm saying?"
"19315690","19321190"," At some point, like three months in a quarter, pull back, then a tag at some point up there."
"19321290","19321870"," Does that make sense?"
"19322390","19326370"," So we've got July, August and September, right?"
"19326570","19327510"," August, September."
"19328710","19329230"," Right. "
"19332840","19335480"," So right there's your next one right there."
"19335540","19336060"," Do you see it?"
"19336460","19339360"," So down, come up, come down, come up."
"19340300","19340880"," Make sense?"
"19341900","19345180"," There are some out there that think that we're not even going to do that. "
"19345340","19347480"," They think that we're going to just blast off."
"19348380","19350080"," Here into August."
"19350080","19353300"," And then we come down into September. "
"19353680","19354400"," Does that make sense?"
"19354640","19355400"," We can do that too."
"19356180","19362400"," We can go right up into August one, tag that 4700, come straight back down."
"19363740","19368140"," So right now, just for this week coming up, we're going to look at that right now. "
"19368340","19368440"," Okay."
"19368660","19371300"," So if you're extremely bullish on earnings season."
"19372320","19372840"," Right. "
"19372980","19376640"," We come right up into into September, excuse me."
"19376780","19380060"," I said August, didn't I?"
"19380060","19380780"," Yeah."
"19383540","19384920"," So you got right here. "
"19385020","19385400"," There it is."
"19385620","19389500"," July, August, then you got September, right?"
"19393280","19394760"," We can draw that right there."
"19398400","19400760"," So you've got one month down. "
"19401140","19402500"," You've got a second month."
"19402760","19406780"," So you've got to September to kind of get where you need to go."
"19407100","19411660"," Some of you think that we squeeze up here and make our way down. "
"19411760","19413660"," So we're going to go right up into October one."
"19414060","19418080"," I'm not anti that trade that like the month of August is outstanding."
"19418860","19420200"," So just be aware of it. "
"19420360","19421900"," So just right now on spy."
"19422480","19423840"," Let's take a look at it."
"19423900","19424100"," Okay. "
"19427600","19429020"," We're going to look at spy here."
"19430600","19432520"," We're going to scroll out a little bit."
"19434840","19436100"," We're going to put some. "
"19442360","19444580"," We're going to look where we are right now."
"19444580","19446160"," You see my targets up here."
"19447320","19448960"," From this Valhalla trade. "
"19449980","19454020"," Our next target above is slightly lower."
"19454180","19454580"," It's right here."
"19456260","19457860"," 459 92. "
"19458520","19459740"," The next one above that."
"19460600","19462920"," This is your next Valhalla target."
"19486090","19487990"," And we're not even taught. "
"19487990","19491770"," You just had somebody say 470 by end of year."
"19492610","19497910"," I think I think funstrats said 480 by end of year."
"19498450","19500610"," If we don't if we only have corrections. "
"19502690","19504830"," If we only have corrections."
"19506250","19508590"," Three four percent something like that."
"19511150","19512850"," Here's our next two levels. "
"19513070","19513710"," Do you see them?"

"19529530","19532370"," Up here 466 on spoons. "
"19532450","19533030"," Squeeze it up."
"19533190","19533890"," Come back down."
"19534830","19537930"," There are some of you out there that think we can do this by August. "
"19540110","19545250"," I think you need a bunch of call buyers that believe we're going to 47480."
"19546250","19548530"," And they send it back down on you."
"19548690","19549610"," So right now. "
"19551770","19554650"," Right now you're only concerned."

"19617930","19618470"," We get a correction."
"19618850","19620330"," So let's look over here."
"19621810","19624310"," We've spent some time over here right. "
"19625970","19628250"," We have a gap to fill down here."
"19629650","19632070"," So just into positioning."
"19634290","19637390"," You're going to expect us to nail that target for the month. "
"19637610","19638550"," Woohoo good job bulls."

"20240840","20242740"," They're like, I don't know. "
"20243040","20256790"," Like part of me"
"20256790","20257570"," just wants the fuck."
"20257990","20259350"," Part of me just wants to reenter."
"20261270","20262150"," Right now. "
"20262650","20264770"," All right."

"20286960","20287580"," It's 324. "
"20294780","20297520"," There's not much time to creepy crawl it up the wall."
"20297840","20297920"," So."
"20302140","20304880"," No, I have faith in my trade here. "
"20305040","20306240"," I have faith in it."
"20311390","20315510"," There's like a part of like this part of today that's important for us."
"20323520","20325420"," They could still roll this down. "
"20325560","20326340"," It could get violent."
"20326680","20327980"," Be careful up in here like this."
"20328160","20330440"," This could be something where they go violence here. "
"20331200","20332820"," And then you get this kind of stuff."
"20333060","20336820"," Just be careful of be ready to buy a dip if you need to."
"20337420","20340020"," They could try to torch the options and go up there. "
"20340020","20342280"," So they're 19 cents right now."
"20344540","20348580"," Like where they'll like they'll hit the target, but they won't print the call."
"20349440","20356220"," So 45 C right they could take 45 C down to two cents or something hit it up here. "
"20356640","20358420"," And you're not going to get 20 cents on it."
"20358460","20359240"," Just be careful here."
"20360740","20362540"," Like a super fast move down. "
"20364620","20366260"," As a matter of fact, hold on here."
"20369610","20371670"," I just took 18 cents."
"20372770","20374450"," I'm going to wait on this. "
"20374830","20375230"," I want to be."
"20375590","20377010"," I'm going to tell you guys something, right?"
"20377230","20378290"," So I just I just got out."
"20379010","20379370"," So. "
"20380390","20382970"," Like they could do some bullshit down here."
"20383270","20385110"," Like they blast it down."
"20385410","20391390"," They turn those for 18's or 45's into like two cent calls. "
"20392470","20397050"," Then they hit it and it prints like six, seven cents or something or they don't even print it."
"20397050","20399010"," So that's three cents in the money."
"20400330","20401890"," So just be really careful. "
"20402310","20404470"," I'm going to I'm going to buy this if it's possible."
"20408240","20409660"," So right there entry."
"20410600","20411840"," No DCA on this trade. "
"20415430","20417730"," It has more to do with paying the options."

"20920290","20921350"," They're just cleaning them out."
"20922670","20924070"," They're trying to murder them."

"20929810","20932290"," We're still likely going up here."
"20933050","20939690"," This is a function of dealers not wanting to print 455s. "
"20940050","20943990"," So even if we go here, they won't want to print the actual call."

"21201000","21207900"," New target upside target two ninety seven thirty nine on Tesla PT one achieved."

"21424570","21426190"," Long again right now."
"21435870","21437190"," I did an entry."
"21437310","21438490"," I'll do a DCA below. "
"21439830","21442690"," I think we I think we do the thing up."
"21442790","21444350"," I think we do the creepy crawly."
"21445910","21446850"," No, no, no, no. "
"21447730","21448390"," All right."
"21449010","21450930"," I think we do the creepy crawly up the wall today."
"21450930","21456910"," It's possible with that said for my take for tomorrow. "
"21456910","21457570"," Okay."
"21457950","21459650"," I want to talk to you guys about something here."
"21462850","21466450"," So I want to say something to you guys today. "
"21469700","21471810"," Tomorrow I believe is Vickspiration."
"21475130","21481610"," You know, there's no like the window of weakness bullshit means nothing."
"21484190","21486630"," Another another note on this. "
"21487110","21489150"," What I want to see tomorrow."
"21489210","21491610"," I want to talk about positioning for tomorrow."
"21491610","21492010"," Okay. "
"21492190","21492670"," Listen closely."
"21493770","21495930"," I want to talk about positioning for tomorrow."
"21501280","21502940"," What I would like to see. "
"21505040","21506240"," If it was me."
"21507620","21510820"," I would like to see a move up into this close."
"21512440","21514880"," A trade sideways overnight. "
"21516160","21518080"," And then sell the open tomorrow."
"21519700","21521580"," So if you ask me what I think."
"21522340","21525680"," I think we trade the I what I would like to see. "
"21526000","21529100"," I mean, this is kind of the top to me right now."
"21530580","21535380"," So what I think though is that we trade this up into the bell or what I'd like to see."
"21536020","21537220"," Is a tag. "
"21537460","21537980"," We tagged it."
"21537980","21542720"," And then we trade it sideways into the open tomorrow."
"21544640","21547040"," And then we sell the actual open. "
"21548200","21550580"," Like right at nine thirty we start selling."
"21551320","21553060"," Then we get a decent pullback."
"21553880","21555840"," That's what I would like to see for tomorrow. "
"21557480","21560520"," So you might want to load up on puts right now."
"21560840","21562980"," I don't want to catch the theta burn."
"21565120","21568980"," Yes, I think I'm going to be sitting on my hands in the overnight. "
"21569860","21571700"," And waiting for that open."
"21572200","21574680"," Some of you going to try to front run this right now."
"21574880","21577720"," You're going to be like fuck that and buying one day puts for tomorrow. "
"21579360","21583260"," I don't think that trade is until four fifteen PM."
"21584580","21587560"," Or it is at the open tomorrow."
"21588460","21590040"," So just be aware of that. "
"21590740","21592020"," Into the end of the day today."
"21592940","21594080"," It's three forty five."
"21594100","21595400"," We have fifteen minutes left. "
"21596560","21598300"," I think they run it up into the bell."
"21598500","21601620"," I think they open it sideways tomorrow and then bam we go down."
"21603080","21604620"," So that's my that's my take. "
"21606060","21611200"," I also want you to know that if we do at any point break above four fifty five twenty."
"21611920","21612740"," We're in a new range."
"21614000","21619920"," Our new range is four fifty five to four fifty nine ninety two. "
"21620700","21622360"," To be aware of that as well."
"21623240","21626940"," What do I say to you when we're coming into these ranges."
"21628200","21629960"," What do I say to you. "
"21631800","21633520"," You guys know what I say right."
"21634000","21635960"," You're buying the dips way down there."
"21639740","21641320"," You put the risk on. "
"21641320","21641440"," Hold on."
"21657110","21660070"," You always trade level the level right."
"21660410","21661750"," So we put the risk on. "
