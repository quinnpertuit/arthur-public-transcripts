"10280","11920"," before the film begins. "
"12560","15160"," It's not a little dehydrated."
"17880","19760"," I don't know if I'd like to share either."
"20800","24860"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of. "
"63660","70300"," I wonder if people took their profit yesterday or not."
"77340","79260"," Good morning, good morning."
"82810","83810"," How's it going out there?"
"83970","84810"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"84990","85350"," Good morning. "
"87290","88230"," Morning Flombak."
"88350","88730"," How are you?"
"89410","90250"," Can not be helped."
"90430","91330"," Good morning, Matt Quela. "
"92150","93190"," Good to see you, brother."
"93870","95510"," A roller coaster, James Glazier."
"97930","98670"," What up, Joe?"
"99030","100890"," What up, 26 grumpy Lee Hahn. "
"101050","101350"," Good morning."
"101750","103050"," How are you, Shaq Baker?"
"104050","106630"," Let's get right into it here."
"108370","109290"," Switch it right out. "
"109450","110990"," Oh, I got to still have some stuff up here."
"111150","112670"," Hang tight for a second."
"114290","116950"," We will mute that right there. "
"118710","119430"," Oh, shoot."
"119630","120430"," Hold on one second here."
"121150","124030"," Let's go to a weeble full screener here. "
"124510","125150"," Do one quick second."
"125330","126090"," I got a couple things I got to do."
"134750","139350"," I had to reset my office this morning. "
"142310","143530"," Not streaming yesterday."
"143770","147030"," It's like everything wanted to update, so give me this quick second here."
"147850","148930"," Okay, so let's start. "
"149130","150430"," Let's start by."
"155990","158870"," This is not where S1 is."
"159010","159430"," I don't think. "
"160290","161690"," I think we're below S1."
"161830","163170"," Let me clear out all the stuff here."
"163270","164130"," Move forward drawings. "
"166750","168610"," This is the trigger screen."
"168890","172010"," Give me one quick second as I get book maps pinned up here."
"173950","178750"," Not quite seeing across yet on spy this morning. "
"185100","188040"," Not seeing the hourly get dragged down anything like that."
"188800","190420"," We've got a weekly trigger right here."
"190500","191400"," Give me one quick second here. "
"206030","206830"," All right."
"208310","209330"," Main screen."
"217060","219160"," We can get this stuff spun up here. "
"230070","231270"," I also got a new."
"231550","232990"," I also got a new."
"235230","239430"," Here and I'm not quite sure from happy with it. "
"243690","245510"," We might be too big."
"246670","250730"," I got a big and tall chair and I'm not six foot one."
"252390","256810"," I'm not quite like tall and I'm not quite big. "
"257529","261390"," I'm a big guy but not not bad or anything."
"263510","269810"," I thought I liked this chair and then it went on sale on Sunday, I think."
"272730","274990"," I think I might have liked a different chair. "
"275310","276530"," I ordered a second chair too."
"276870","277970"," So I ordered two chairs."
"279030","281050"," One's being delivered and one I could pick up. "
"282410","285910"," So we'll see when that other chair comes in and see if it's better than this one."
"286730","287610"," We'll have a second here."
"296280","299460"," Okay, so that book map up here. "
"301820","303800"," Leave this stuff down here."
"303800","313560"," I still have a cross here"
"313560","316340"," on the hourly and the half out of the downside."
"316760","318820"," You got a target down here to check out. "
"319280","320480"," 431 30."
"322100","325220"," 431 31 on the weekly trigger down below here."
"325740","334520"," And then your S one this morning is at 431.02. So we'll put that in really quick. "
"347560","348740"," Right down here."
"348900","349860"," This is your S one."
"355360","364120"," If any of you guys, I guess whoever stayed with me on Friday on Friday. "
"366820","368540"," Leave that right down there."
"369620","373420"," Get a one minute cross five minute cross bearish."
"373680","377360"," We should expect at least that 431.02. We'll see if we bounce up it. "
"377900","379180"," This weekly trigger down here."
"381260","385020"," Leave you with me on Friday as we close the show out."
"385740","390000"," I was going to get short, not short, but long puts for a hedge. "
"390800","395080"," And if you stuck around until the end, I want to go with calls instead."
"396080","397460"," It was a good day yesterday."
"398460","403720"," And not only was it good, I had a small hedge, like a 10 cent puts and I had 30"
"403720","409640"," cent or 50 cent calls on Friday. "
"410020","416300"," Now, I needed to make 60 cents to break even on the on the trade itself, which it did, of"
"416300","418120"," course, make good money in the trade yesterday."
"419220","422420"," And then yesterday morning, I had a doctor's appointments."
"422600","424320"," Matter of fact, I got a few of them this week. "
"424460","424640"," I got."
"425460","428040"," Two or three more doctors appointments coming up."
"428200","431740"," I've got, I've got doctors looking at my butthole. "
"432200","433180"," Believe it or not."
"433640","434900"," And my foot."
"435320","438260"," I've got some damage that I've done over the years to my feet. "
"439120","442980"," That needs to be for a second time operated."
"443340","445060"," Actually, this is the third time."
"446200","454900"," And my my doctors are scratching their heads because this is the first I broke my foot years ago"
"454900","455660"," when I was young. "
"456520","463960"," And then I do a lot of outside type activities and they thought that I had cut my foot open"
"463960","467280"," and got some dirt into it."
"468080","470620"," And I'm having an infection of my foot years ago."
"470840","472960"," This was five years ago or maybe longer. "
"473720","475500"," And they cut out a bunch of shit out of my foot."
"476100","482300"," And then now I'm having more problems, having problems with damage that I've done to my feet, like"
"482300","484840"," stepping on hard rock stuff like that."
"485760","491200"," And it's built up these like damaged tissue underneath my foot. "
"491560","494900"," I'm still fine to walk and all that stuff, but they're going in there to clean out a bunch of"
"494900","496720"," damage that I've done to myself."
"497140","498700"," I guess that's the simple way to explain it."
"500500","506160"," And then I've got a I was able to get my my butt looked at. "
"506780","508120"," And so I show up to that too."
"508240","508680"," I've got that."
"510280","513460"," That's like a process like show up and they give you a bunch of crap to do. "
"515740","517780"," Trading four thirty two forty six."
"518460","520600"," We'll look to see if we can at least trade down here."
"520960","522600"," So we're going to talk about a few. "
"523100","526620"," We're going to talk about some earnings stuff today and market."
"526840","528040"," I'm kind of shocked right now."
"528180","532520"," It's like they got in the office of sport and I was like, oh, they pulled the entire move back"
"532520","533260"," from yesterday. "
"534140","542220"," It does look like if you're looking at if you look at the if you look at the triggers, right?"
"543140","545120"," Looks like we're just bouncing around, right?"
"545400","546880"," Lots of consolidation down in here."
"547980","549540"," There's the trigger screen right here."
"549740","552100"," Just bouncing above and below that daily trigger. "
"553300","557560"," And that daily trigger keeps getting bought that or the weekly trigger keeps getting bought."
"557820","566260"," So you'd expect as excuse me, you'd expect a lot of the same of that today."
"567000","569320"," You'd expect that half hour trigger to hold. "
"569540","570740"," We're kind of close to it right now."
"572700","576300"," And so we'll look for that if we can get possibly get that half."
"576460","578380"," This is a 30 minute chart on spoons. "
"580000","581980"," We can get that half hour trigger by."
"585610","589650"," It's been fairly consistent by it, by it, by it, by it."
"589890","591850"," And then you'd be looking for that same by down here. "
"592490","593030"," Could be a trap."
"593370","593690"," You never know."
"593690","599190"," But as long as we stay above, as long as we stay above that S1, we should be fine. "
"599370","605190"," The one thing to consider down here is always price being above the one in five minute triggers,"
"605210","607750"," which you guys mostly know about anyways."
"608430","612170"," So if you're looking for that trade, it should be coming up here shortly."
"614430","617030"," It looks like almost the entire move from yesterday. "
"617090","617870"," Let's take a peek."
"619170","620950"," That's 8.33 in the morning."
"621690","624070"," And then sometimes you always see this kind of stuff right here. "
"624730","627050"," It's that four o'clock move down below here."
"627110","631410"," Keep your eyes on this gap that's left behind down that weekly trigger."
"631590","637010"," This is yesterday at four a.m. Is that little box down here?"
"637050","638170"," That's where that S1 is. "
"639370","640570"," So that's the big pivot."
"645950","647410"," Let me one click second here."
"654460","655900"," Yeah, so there's a gap right here. "
"656180","658120"," And then let me see that come back down here so you guys can see it."
"658440","660000"," So here's the full gap right here."
"670490","671690"," Hold on a second here. "
"680300","681440"," Kind of lost your hero."
"689500","691660"," Sorry about that if I lost you on the screen."
"692920","695880"," So down here, we've got this gap that was left unfilled. "
"699280","700960"," This is gaps right down here."
"701180","703280"," This is right before the open at four a.m. yesterday."
"704860","706780"," We'll take a look at that gap down here. "
"707720","710100"," Right about there, right down there."
"711640","713720"," That gap is right here."
"719780","721680"," It's kind of where they fuck around with you, right?"
"721960","723660"," Tuesday is kind of like we call it. "
"726260","728140"," Turn around Tuesday, right?"
"728560","731080"," You guys all know what turn around Tuesday is."
"731500","734100"," I always like to call it fuck around Tuesday."
"734560","736960"," Get y'all scared and paranoid, right?"
"737140","740020"," They accumulate a Monday to mess around on Tuesday. "
"740080","743340"," They wind up directly taking their profits by Thursday."
"744900","747320"," And then we close out Friday."
"747660","749620"," So we'll see if we can get a good price here this morning. "
"750320","751400"," Move that over."
"756750","758090"," Yeah, they give me a bunch of crap."
"758130","758970"," Do my butthole. "
"760950","762170"," They, you know, like they."
"763110","766110"," They want me to eat a certain way and drink certain things and."
"771100","772480"," Take a look at TLT today. "
"772800","774220"," I don't mind taking a look at that one if you want."
"774400","776120"," So just down here is that gap down below."
"776980","780960"," Kind of know you want to see it get closed and you got S3 down here too. "
"801660","802540"," Right there."
"812650","813690"," More and how y'all doing."
"814690","815510"," Doctors visit one. "
"815590","815770"," Okay."
"816730","817950"," Still have more to go."
"818110","818990"," I've got a list of them. "
"819310","822530"," I'll get the, I'll get the exact dates again for you today."
"822750","825330"," I don't think people ever like a tape told people last week."
"826010","827350"," And they were like, yeah, whatever. "
"827430","830070"," I also got a Twitch coming up this weekend."
"830930","832430"," I've told you guys about that as well."
"832690","834110"," So we have Twitch coming up on the weekend. "
"834570","840070"," And I've got a series of doctors appointments that I scheduled a couple weeks ago."
"840470","842150"," And I don't know how those are going to go."
"842210","844250"," I don't know what the outcomes are. "
"844710","847950"," How many reschedules are all that all the kind of crap that goes along with it."
"848230","849930"," But it's like doctor season four."
"851070","852110"," Jimmy James here. "
"854410","855070"," What up Dave?"
"855770","856750"," I know you are brother."
"859870","860770"," That was the butt."
"863090","864670"," My butthole looks like shit. "
"865170","865730"," It's weird."
"865930","867750"," They said my butthole didn't look like shit."
"867870","869230"," They stuck their finger at my butt. "
"869970","871690"," I don't know if it was their finger, but."
"872990","873910"," Oh, it's second."
"875850","876990"," I felt that though. "
"877070","877470"," I felt it."
"886480","890480"," How do I pick a how do I pick a dock for a ball and ball cancer?"
"890840","891620"," You know what it was was."
"893220","896640"," My buddy is a doctor. "
"897640","901160"," And he told me to get my colonoscopy."
"901240","903000"," I tried to get one last year."
"903780","905340"," And I was told no. "
"906600","908860"," Because I didn't exhibit anything that."
"909880","912240"," Called for it and I wasn't old enough."
"913520","918680"," Now my buddy told me to make shit up to get that done. "
"919980","922560"," And so I came back to this checkup."
"923200","928420"," And I complained with the right complaints and they granted me one."
"928940","931140"," Now they don't want to give you one until you turn 50. "
"931780","935900"," So if you're in your like 40, 40, mid 40s, anything like that, they're going to usually get denied."
"936760","937140"," And."
"938640","941100"," But he told me to get it done younger because. "
"942420","948500"," If they find anything up there, it's rather than trying to treat it like more like let's say it's"
"948500","948920"," some cancer."
"949600","952080"," Rather than try to manage it over 10 or 20 years."
"953120","956960"," Which is what oftentimes what doctors prefer to do, believe it or not. "
"957820","959660"," Cost a lot of money to get this stuff done."
"961640","963340"," So what they want to do."
"963720","966740"," What they do is cost a lot of money to get done, right?"
"967040","970820"," So if most people come back in their 40s with nothing wrong. "
"971620","973980"," It's wasting money for insurance companies, right?"
"974180","974740"," That's what it is."
"975140","975580"," So."
"978460","980760"," And then you get stuck into a treatment plan. "
"980980","983300"," A lot of doctor should say a lot."
"983480","984900"," Depending on what kind of doctor you are."
"985460","988140"," Some doctors believe in like whole cure. "
"988960","990700"," And other doctors believe in treatments, right?"
"990980","994460"," And some doctors are there's like a hypocratic medical crowd both, but."
"995560","999700"," When they go to medical school, they have a thesis behind how to cure people."
"999700","1001720"," It's like they're like the body or medicine. "
"1002480","1006920"," They take not that don't use other forms of treatments, but anyways."
"1007640","1011880"," Kind of like getting a little weird here, but the idea here would be."
"1013560","1015300"," That insurance companies and. "
"1017900","1020140"," You know, it's like the military industrial complex."
"1020140","1025119"," You have like a medical industrial complex and nothing's free anymore, right?"
"1025319","1026319"," They're not going to give you a free."
"1027520","1029260"," You're not going to get a free anything. "
"1029579","1031380"," It's like diabetes drugs the same way, right?"
"1031780","1032520"," It's supposed to be free."
"1033060","1035040"," They end up charging a billion dollars, right?"
"1035480","1036900"," And they don't want to cure you of anything."
"1037220","1039700"," They want you on the system, right?"
"1039700","1044020"," The rest of your fucking life every morning or afternoon or night or whatever it is. "
"1044220","1046339"," So you kind of you're stuck fighting."
"1047640","1048640"," All of this."
"1050340","1053920"," Will's trying to keep yourself healthy and live a long life. "
"1054180","1055120"," So that's what I did."
"1056440","1058500"," And but I didn't expect it though."
"1058700","1061900"," I went and originally went into this doctor's appointment for a checkup. "
"1062660","1063940"," My mental health."
"1064980","1066060"," And my foot."
"1066060","1072040"," And so I was in the, I was in the, uh, it was in the doc, the original doctor's appointment. "
"1072240","1077600"," This was about a week or two ago and it was in the original appointment and went in there because"
"1077600","1079660"," the wife said, uh, we're coming."
"1079960","1082260"," Like the last winter here in Michigan for me was brutal."
"1083240","1088820"," And so I wanted to, or my wife wanted me to look at. "
"1090680","1095380"," Seasonal, uh, something disorder, something with do with like seasonal depression."
"1096640","1098720"," So I was like, well go and tell, tell about it."
"1099460","1102260"," Someone in there and I'm getting my, my checkup. "
"1103380","1107480"," And they were like, here's, they're like, here's a drug."
"1108300","1111160"," They gave me a prescription for prozac."
"1112520","1116480"," And had me, uh, find an appointment for a, for a counselor. "
"1117820","1122080"," First appointment available December 17th in a prescription."
"1122380","1122760"," That's what they did."
"1122940","1122960"," Right. "
"1123820","1124800"," And then I, oh, look at that."
"1124900","1125720"," Nice squeeze right there."
"1125760","1126380"," Nice little bounce. "
"1127320","1131780"," And then they, um, then they wanted me to, or so they got that."
"1132140","1135440"," And then I told my foot they looked at it and they were like, yeah, you got to have that"
"1135440","1135840"," looked at."
"1136080","1139140"," So I got a, then I got an appointment for my foot for a podiatrist. "
"1139840","1143720"," And they gave me two doctors recommended to me."
"1143720","1149500"," So I called both of them, one called back and I made an appointment."
"1149960","1154240"," And then the other doc, and then told them about the butt and they gave me, they finally gave me"
"1154240","1155400"," the colonoscopy. "
"1156220","1161820"," So they checked my butt in the office and they sent me again yesterday to prep for a colonoscopy."
"1163420","1165760"," And checked me out, gave me an exam as well."
"1166000","1167460"," And then so all those three things. "
"1167860","1169080"," Now that that's not the norm."
"1169080","1176680"," This is a new doctor for me because, uh, my, I went from a nice doctor and then tried a"
"1176680","1177380"," new doctor."
"1178720","1182920"," Last year, I think, tried a new doctor, new primary care physician. "
"1183480","1184200"," Never should have done that."
"1185000","1187120"," It went back to my old primary care physician."
"1188380","1192080"," And so now I'm back with my old office, different doctor, but same office. "
"1192960","1196600"," And I made a huge mistake leaving that, uh, that office."
"1197740","1198780"," Squeezing right back now."
"1199280","1202360"," Uh, we'll see if there's a rejection above on this cluster right here. "
"1202820","1206480"," If not, uh, we're going to be looking for a reversal to the upside."
"1207820","1212620"," I think we get rejected and still down, but, you know, if it gets above the, uh, one in five"
"1212620","1213080"," minute here."
"1213240","1214580"," It begins to turn around. "
"1214720","1215620"," I'll jump on a trade with you."
"1219980","1220340"," Yeah."
"1220620","1221920"," So I went back to my original doctor. "
"1222180","1222200"," Okay."
"1222260","1223260"," I go back to my original doctor."
"1223420","1225340"," My original doctor is like, what do you need?"
"1225340","1229420"," And I'm like, I need this, this, this and this and, uh, boom. "
"1230060","1231500"," All, all the doors open."
"1231740","1232560"," And that's like the thing, right?"
"1232680","1239040"," If your doctor doesn't recommend, um, if your primary care physician doesn't recommend something to"
"1239040","1242900"," be done for you, I think they keep your ass getting getting shit, right?"
"1246000","1246520"," Yeah."
"1246620","1247960"," Seasonal effective disorder. "
"1249560","1253960"," Uh, I wasn't going to take, so I've never taken a full disclosure here."
"1254220","1255500"," I'm not on any drugs."
"1255500","1257380"," Uh, no prescriptions. "
"1258200","1258640"," I have one."
"1258780","1263920"," I've got a, um, uh, dick pills and I went to an online doctor for those."
"1264360","1264920"," I don't need them. "
"1265000","1266340"," My doctor wouldn't give them to me."
"1267040","1270120"," Uh, I don't physically like, I don't physically need them."
"1270800","1276240"," Um, but I went to an online doctor and it was like, it was like, fill out the form like"
"1276240","1277200"," this and I got it. "
"1278380","1283420"," Now that's the only prescription that I had and I don't normally take prescriptions."
"1284060","1284540"," Never."
"1284660","1285800"," I take supplements and stuff. "
"1285920","1290660"," I take vitamins, vitamin D, vitamin E, uh, that kind of stuff."
"1291300","1292720"," Um, and that's, that's it."
"1293280","1297420"," Uh, so this is new for me. "
"1297480","1302780"," So I've been a counselor once in my life, uh, person military shit outside of that."
"1303680","1307640"," Uh, that, and that got me involved in like yoga, not, but I hadn't done it."
"1307700","1315400"," I have done yoga in the past, but, um, like, intensely involved in, uh, uh, some, uh, some self"
"1315400","1316480"," help stuff that I had to do. "
"1317340","1320960"," Make sure that I, uh, uh, it was a functioning adult, right?"
"1321200","1324580"," Like, uh, those all military stuff, PTSD type stuff."
"1324920","1327520"," Uh, so that was all taken care of."
"1327580","1329780"," Now this time I went, they just, they just got me a prescription. "
"1330200","1333940"," So I wasn't going to take the, uh, Prozac, but I did start taking it."
"1334500","1336900"," Uh, two or three days ago, I started taking it."
"1337700","1339760"," Uh, I haven't noticed anything. "
"1339760","1345160"," So I don't know if any of you've ever taken that, uh, before, but I did start taking it."
"1345320","1346600"," Yeah, I wasn't going to take it."
"1346740","1348320"," I was like, ah, Prozac looks kind of weird. "
"1348880","1349920"," Uh, we didn't take it."
"1349980","1352900"," My wife was like, take the goddamn fucking drug that they gave you."
"1352900","1354020"," So I'm like, okay, so I'll take it. "
"1354160","1354520"," I'll take it."
"1354620","1355880"," It's been, it's been taken."
"1360660","1361020"," Yeah. "
"1362340","1363000"," Deep hills and yoga."
"1365480","1368260"," The deep hills have been fun, especially if you don't need them."
"1368260","1371700"," Uh, if you've never had depots before, they're fucking crazy. "
"1372040","1373220"," It's like you're 14 years old."
"1373620","1374060"," What?"
"1374460","1378940"," And well, and well, the depots that they gave me too, they're, um, called Cialis."
"1379720","1382560"," So you don't have, you're like, you're like a walking erection or anything. "
"1383360","1387220"," But you take them and, uh, if you need a walking erection, you can just blink."
"1388040","1389280"," And you've got one."
"1389920","1392520"," It's like you're like 12 years old or something, 14 years old. "
"1393360","1394920"," It reminds me when I was like 14."
"1397580","1399100"," So it's, it's fucking awesome."
"1399220","1400820"," So like I can't say it's not awesome. "
"1404750","1405650"," Yeah, I don't know."
"1405830","1409030"," I mean, I don't, I don't know if they're going to keep me on it or if I needed it"
"1409030","1409910"," or I don't need it."
"1411350","1414270"," Um, I don't know if any of you have ever taken Prozac out there. "
"1414790","1415970"," I don't even know."
"1416370","1418210"," I haven't, I haven't noticed any difference."
"1418610","1420910"," They were, um, I see I got it right here. "
"1423830","1430250"," They're, uh, 20 milligram pills."
"1430730","1432330"," So never had them."
"1432510","1433570"," Never taking it. "
"1435690","1438470"," All I remember was that there was a book."
"1438610","1441210"," Wasn't there a book or a movie called Prozac Nation?"
"1441910","1447030"," I was going to watch that movie and see what it was all about because I have no idea."
"1452100","1453900"," Yeah, Cialis is fucking awesome. "
"1453900","1459280"," That, that ain't that trucker took stop pills, pill stuff."
"1462160","1464900"," Oh yeah, squeezing up to the hourly trigger right now."
"1467060","1468400"," We'll squeeze up here. "
"1475000","1476820"," My ex wife has been out of 20 years."
"1477080","1480500"," It's helped her, uh, for, what did you say?"
"1482340","1484480"," Helped her with anxiety after her mother's death."
"1484840","1484960"," Yeah. "
"1484960","1485140"," Yeah."
"1486820","1487240"," Yeah."
"1487780","1488920"," I've heard good things. "
"1489220","1490340"," I mean, some people say it works."
"1490720","1492700"," I haven't heard too much negative at this point."
"1492900","1494720"," I've heard something about a lot of weight loss. "
"1497260","1499960"," I haven't experienced any of the downsides."
"1501260","1505620"," The only thing that I would say about it was I felt a little, I felt a little speedy."
"1507420","1511360"," To me, just slightly like the, like a hint of a Adderall. "
"1523600","1525500"," Squeezing up to the hourly trigger right now."
"1552310","1553290"," Man, look at it."
"1553390","1554830"," I'll take a peek at Dixie here. "
"1555010","1558230"," Dixie looks like it wants to bounce and reject the depths of hell."
"1559550","1561110"," A Tesla with a nice clean bounce."
"1562950","1564250"," Alpha coming back to check. "
"1564710","1565850"," Vix is trade in 1843."
"1566790","1567370"," That's good to see."
"1567450","1568090"," It's up that high. "
"1569030","1574350"," Nasdaq with a nice bounce down below at a 14, 921ish."
"1576030","1578390"," That last known support down there before."
"1578650","1582670"," Pretty significant drop, the 14, 748, 784. "
"1591010","1592370"," Vix is still elevated."
"1592690","1593490"," It just parked up here."
"1604270","1605750"," A little bit of an odd dock. "
"1605910","1608130"," I'm looking at Dixie right now and."
"1610950","1613330"," It's kind of a weird market right now."
"1613330","1621030"," I'm looking at like, as an example, I'm looking at H.Y.G. H.Y.G. 1, 2, 3, 4,"
"1621850","1625190"," 5, 5, down days at H.Y.G. right. "
"1626250","1630370"," Forming a nice, nice pull flag here on the one hour."
"1631870","1636310"," It's selling off that one hour 27, 21 EMA."
"1638210","1640210"," So that's looking actually bullish. "
"1642030","1643110"," Which is kind of weird."
"1643250","1645830"," A one minute chart on Vix right looks bullish."
"1647330","1651410"," But then in a five minute chart, it looks like it can roll slightly and then bounce. "
"1651970","1653710"," That actually looks bullish even right here."
"1654370","1657990"," But Vix looks like it can roll down a little bit and then bounce though, right?"
"1658170","1663210"," So Vix looks like whatever bounce comes out of H.Y.G. will get rejected."
"1665970","1670590"," Nasdaq parked on its pretty significant support zone here. "
"1671130","1673350"," But Dixie looks extremely bearish."
"1674390","1681570"," Like it wants to get out and clear out that 106 gap down at 106.23. So we'll see."
"1681850","1682710"," Mixed bag here. "
"1682830","1688410"," It looks like it looks like there's a possibility of some kind of a recheck, some kind of a recheck"
"1688410","1691510"," kiss trade and then an upside move, but to be tempered."
"1713540","1714400"," What do I want?"
"1715980","1716420"," Vy Vance."
"1717680","1718120"," Okay. "
"1718380","1718820"," Vy Vance."
"1719000","1719840"," I don't know what that is."
"1720060","1720960"," We'll rewrite that down. "
"1721120","1721300"," Hold on."
"1725050","1726850"," Let me write down Vy Vance here."
"1727050","1727190"," Hold on. "
"1731410","1732490"," I don't have anything about it."
"1739800","1740780"," Yeah, I got."
"1741900","1743160"," Vy Vance is the shit. "
"1743320","1743500"," Okay."
"1744400","1748620"," What I ended up doing was to last winter."
"1750400","1753680"," So last winter really got to me. "
"1753980","1756140"," I don't know what I think I know what it was."
"1756140","1760360"," So last winter, we did not have a fall or a spring."
"1761260","1766940"," Now our winter was very mild, but we had gray skies, rain drizzles. "
"1767720","1769540"," It was really dreary."
"1769540","1774560"," So where we didn't have like temperature cold or I'm great with snow and fine with snow and"
"1774560","1781900"," bluebird skitties, but Michigan this year or this past year specifically was a rough winter."
"1782340","1783160"," It was brutal. "
"1783420","1785160"," Even with vacations didn't matter."
"1786360","1790000"," It was just gray skies all day long every day."
"1790260","1792480"," It started early in the fall last year. "
"1793140","1797900"," It started like October and it ran straight into basically summer."
"1798840","1801160"," This summer and it was just too many months."
"1801360","1806060"," It was just like too many months of dreary days and I almost moved. "
"1806400","1808660"," That's how that's how much it impacted me last year."
"1808780","1810560"," I was like, get me out of this fucking state."
"1810580","1813380"," I was like, I can't do it because I can't do it. "
"1813380","1820820"," It's very similar to living in like Portland or Seattle, especially on that eastern seaboard of"
"1820820","1823940"," those western states and it just got to me last year."
"1823940","1830700"," So I don't know if you've ever lived on the west coast and the northwest coast, but that's that's"
"1830700","1831500"," chicken get to you."
"1837610","1839870"," Really want them to close that gap down there. "
"1839930","1842450"," I don't like the idea of them not closing that gap here."
"1845590","1847570"," Not a fan of it right now."
"1848490","1849110"," All right. "
"1849110","1849870"," So we're going to take a look."
"1850030","1851590"," I'm going to read something off to you this morning."
"1853170","1858890"," We're going to talk about the thumbnail that's on this video, which is dollar tree. "
"1859450","1865650"," So Goldman Sachs is saying that it's time to buy dollar tree."
"1865870","1867230"," I took a look at it this morning."
"1869530","1873110"," And we're going to take a look at I think it's DLTR, right?"
"1874850","1877030"," So we're going to look at dollar tree. "
"1877870","1879450"," I should have said something sooner."
"1881070","1883270"," I should have said something off the open."
"1883990","1886410"," This is four o'clock this morning. "
"1886410","1891810"," And dollar tree is ripping, but I also want to draw your attention to."
"1893410","1896230"," I'm going to take a peak here at dollar tree if possible."
"1896830","1900210"," It's already blasting up right off the open. "
"1900210","1900930"," It's been blasting."
"1901890","1903810"," So this is dollar tree right here."
"1904510","1912370"," What I want to direct your attention towards is the hourly cross on the daily on DLTR. "
"1914770","1919410"," And if you haven't jumped on it already on dollar tree, it's been climbing, climbing, climbing."
"1920610","1923330"," As long as it stay, we're getting across right now."
"1923490","1929390"," The half hour trigger should begin to squeeze higher and start to take out right now. "
"1929390","1931790"," Price is sitting at 113 47."
"1932870","1935370"," I'm going to give you guys some targets for it."
"1937890","1939310"," There's one right there. "
"1939650","1942770"," There's another one right there."
"1943930","1945810"," There's another one down there, I guess."
"1945890","1947690"," I guess you could say there's a band right there. "
"1948310","1952810"," This should be a pretty significant rejection point up here."
"1953750","1957950"," Some volatility above that 121 124 29."
"1958870","1964130"," Then a giant gap to close giant gaps to close on dollar tree. "
"1964990","1967610"," 141 34 is the big one, right?"
"1968890","1974090"," So let's take a look at, you know, there's a lot of there's a lot of sexy up in here."
"1974770","1975810"," So dollar tree."
"1977870","1979810"," This is kind of what you're looking for, right?"
"1979990","1981950"," You can't really ask for too much more, right?"
"1982070","1983090"," You got consolidating price. "
"1983810","1985230"," You've got earning season beginning."
"1985630","1986990"," You got to squeeze up and above."
"1987990","1992010"," Your first point of resistance here is that fit 115 74. "
"1992710","1994250"," I would like to see."
"1995430","2001550"," Some kind of a squeeze up here and then a pullback and catch that hourly trigger."
"2002750","2004490"," For this move up here. "
"2007910","2011070"," Something like that right there."
"2011930","2013590"," Catch that bounce right there."
"2018300","2024140"," This is dollar tree right squeeze up bounce back down catch that hour and then begin to fight with"
"2024140","2024480"," this. "
"2025360","2027240"," This volatility zone."
"2027520","2037500"," So this is DLTR call this zone of volatility zone of all."
"2037880","2041840"," It sounds so evil zone of all right here. "
"2043160","2045280"," Now this is the one you want to be watching."
"2045300","2049040"," If you can get above this zone of volatility."
"2049960","2052000"," You got two more targets to the upside. "
"2052360","2057920"," 130 and 133 30 133 98."
"2058340","2060860"," But I would really like to have that price target get up here."
"2061540","2065620"," Really like to see us trade that one 40 90 up there. "
"2066239","2069659"," You got one one zone one one big target right here."
"2069920","2076199"," You got another target right here at that 130 and then that 140 Valhalla kind of trade."
"2076960","2078159"," To the upside. "
"2078360","2080500"," I'm going to read you some stuff about this trade right here."

"2123710","2127170"," And we have a bull cross down below here."

"2438050","2438830"," You know Detroit's aware."
"2439170","2440990"," I read a story this morning about Detroit."
"2441750","2443210"," They want to. "
"2443870","2445090"," They're fighting there."
"2445210","2447970"," There are people fighting for rent control in Detroit."
"2449810","2452590"," And it doesn't doesn't affect me. "
"2453850","2456650"," It's I've got mixed feelings on rent control."
"2459630","2463790"," It's hard to my feelings are mixed against red control."
"2464270","2466970"," I don't mind rent subsidies. "
"2467310","2469410"," Well I'm against rent control here."
"2470370","2472330"," In Detroit right now."
"2472870","2474790"," I don't think it'd be against it in general. "
"2475710","2477190"," Well I have mixed feelings on it."
"2479710","2481730"," Like I used to live in."
"2481850","2482850"," I lived in New York. "
"2482990","2484170"," I lived in Santa Monica."
"2484490","2485230"," Both had rent control."
"2485930","2488070"," And it's a mixed bag. "
"2489670","2490910"," It's a mixed bag."
"2491330","2492290"," It really is."
"2492510","2495350"," It's got good benefits and then it's got some really fucked up benefits. "
"2495590","2496630"," And Detroit in particular."
"2498350","2501450"," Is like not quite ready for rent control."
"2502670","2507370"," And some of the major issues with rent control here in Detroit where I live. "
"2508270","2513470"," One of the major issues right now is Detroit housing stock."
"2516530","2519870"," Went unattended for a long time."
"2520110","2521590"," I mean a long time. "
"2522390","2522730"," Decades."
"2523750","2526510"," They have a lot of homes here that have not been."
"2527890","2529270"," Brought to code. "
"2529770","2531970"," And the code here has been."
"2533190","2534490"," Raised significantly."
"2535890","2536530"," Which is good. "
"2537290","2541010"," So I feel like Detroit said this like one step at a time."
"2543810","2545530"," One step at a time right."
"2546450","2548710"," Like progress one step at a time. "
"2549130","2549430"," And."
"2551930","2555990"," I was reading this article and I heard about it last week, week ago."
"2556650","2558710"," And some friends and then I heard about it again. "
"2559390","2562810"," And then finally read an article about it this morning that was front center."
"2564590","2566150"," See, hold on a second here."
"2577510","2580630"," Yeah, so Dixie just got sent to the depths of hell. "
"2580630","2580970"," Right."
"2581150","2582910"," It just closed that 106 down there."
"2583970","2585950"," Yeah, Dixie just got smashed. "
"2589850","2590770"," Detroit's a weird place."
"2591190","2596370"," Like they used to like you say the buy house in Detroit."
"2596370","2596790"," Right. "
"2597570","2599290"," And you didn't have to do shit."
"2599550","2600350"," No lead abatement."
"2600450","2600950"," No nothing. "
"2601650","2602510"," It was really rough."
"2603690","2607290"," And then protections for tenants really started to change."
"2608510","2610550"," Some protections for landlords do. "
"2611270","2612950"," But pretend it's really started to change."
"2612950","2613870"," It started to improve."
"2615950","2616930"," Requirements for. "
"2617990","2619650"," Now I want to buy calls here."
"2621070","2623190"," You want to buy calls here so bad."
"2625190","2625710"," But. "
"2627030","2629010"," I'm like, I'm looking around and I'm like this."
"2629690","2631550"," I bet this looks like a dead cat bucket."
"2631770","2633330"," Not a really a dead cat pounds, like a."
"2634370","2635230"," No movement day. "
"2635230","2637530"," I think it looks like a trap."
"2638270","2639630"," So I'm going to hang tight here."
"2642640","2643520"," It's really weird. "
"2643740","2645460"," Like, so this is the issue with Detroit."
"2645740","2651000"," So Detroit had a housing stock that nobody could afford rent."
"2651300","2651360"," Right. "
"2651800","2652720"," Everyone fled to Detroit."
"2653080","2653340"," People."
"2653840","2654320"," Everybody. "
"2654660","2655360"," Didn't matter this color."
"2655540","2656360"," You can get out."
"2656460","2656940"," You got out. "
"2657840","2658940"," Detroit wanted to major decline."
"2659760","2662240"," And then there was reinvestment in this city."
"2662240","2662520"," Right. "
"2664580","2666360"," Now with reinvestment in the city."
"2666780","2668340"," There came with that came with."
"2668760","2671620"," What came with that was, hey, we got to do better. "
"2673080","2674800"," With tenants in the city."
"2675300","2676520"," That's all fine and good."
"2676960","2678660"," Now saying that right. "
"2678940","2680760"," It costs a lot of money for that investment."
"2681840","2683260"," And it really does."
"2683800","2686300"," You can't cut it any other way. "
"2686300","2686800"," So."
"2688140","2689820"," For Detroit specifically."
"2691300","2692640"," You have to be able to buy cheap. "
"2692940","2697380"," You have to be able to buy cheap because."
"2698440","2702260"," The cost of renovating here is out of fucking control."
"2702920","2705900"," And it's not like you're renovating to make it livable. "
"2706320","2708320"," You're like ripping all the pipes out."
"2708520","2710020"," You're ripping all the electrical out."
"2710280","2711740"," You're basically rebuilding a new home. "
"2712540","2715640"," You bet when you buy a home here, oftentimes you do it the right way."
"2716120","2717360"," You're talking about."
"2718440","2719760"," Basically building a new home. "
"2719940","2721040"," That's basically what you're doing."
"2721040","2721560"," You're ripping."
"2721740","2723380"," You're ripping the entire fucking thing down. "
"2723600","2726860"," You're basically moving all the any lead or potential lead."
"2727140","2733080"," All the walls, you're re re insulating everything, rerunning new wires, new plumbing, new drains,"
"2733520","2735380"," new roof, new everything."
"2737160","2738520"," That's what you're basically doing. "
"2738740","2742420"," And if you're going to, especially if you're going to buy a home to rent to somebody."
"2743240","2744520"," You want to do that."
"2744620","2745660"," You want to just get rid of everything. "
"2745660","2748780"," Put all new windows in and that's shit costs money."
"2748980","2750020"," It costs a lot of money."
"2750180","2750940"," I'm not going to lie to you. "
"2751040","2751620"," It's not cheap."
"2752860","2762360"," That to that investment requires rents to be not crazy, but the norm at minimum, the norm."
"2763400","2767640"," To entice investors to come in and make that 20% every year. "
"2768640","2773180"," You start to tell an investor, yeah, you're going to make 5% maybe 10."
"2773180","2775420"," And then again, possibly."
"2776820","2780900"," Possibly encounter some kind of pitfall along the way. "
"2781400","2783120"," They're not going to come to the city."
"2784420","2785180"," They're not."
"2785360","2786640"," As a matter of fact, there were. "
"2788940","2794820"," When those changes came into Detroit, from lead abatements to removal."
"2796580","2798780"," Like a shift to pushing towards removal."
"2798860","2800140"," Once we came to that. "
"2801000","2806060"," A lot of older investors began to sell."
"2807160","2814160"," Now, a new group of younger investors came into the strike and said, well, we can make this work."
"2816180","2816420"," But. "
"2817720","2822640"," They are absorbing these new investors are absorbing."
"2824960","2828480"," That cost and their take, they've taken on that cost."
"2828480","2830380"," So I don't know that these new investors. "
"2833140","2837120"," Will want to deal with that with that with rent control."
"2838040","2838940"," Right now."
"2839160","2843540"," So I'm fascinated to see if it will be net positive or net negative. "
"2844020","2847760"," For where Detroit is traits in a really weird place, not like every other city."
"2848820","2850680"," Here's the pivot point above for."
"2852120","2853200"," 35 53. "
"2855660","2856700"," We are long."
"2857120","2859280"," You can see the positioning here in the right hand side."
"2859500","2860540"," We have the cross down below. "
"2861900","2864420"," Recheck on the hourly and daily trigger."
"2864600","2865640"," This is a four trigger cluster."
"2866040","2868760"," Five actually five figures with the half hour. "
"2868760","2869420"," Very powerful."
"2869520","2872160"," Usually we can usually blast off and start ripping faces."
"2873640","2877440"," I'll show you four 37 58 is your next target to the upside. "
"2884480","2885560"," That one up there."
"2889180","2889700"," And."
"2890780","2893680"," You know, I would say like I would say it would depend. "
"2894000","2896660"," I'm not anti rent control or rents are out of control."
"2897340","2900280"," Rents here are though pretty good right now."
"2901100","2902980"," If you're renting in that in downtown. "
"2903900","2908740"," You're going to be you're going to be paying three grand a month, which is good for Detroit."
"2908920","2910080"," Never been like that before."
"2910820","2913260"," So it is getting a little, little expensive here. "
"2914780","2919360"," But you can still find an apartment or a house here for like a thousand bucks right around a grand."
"2920800","2923840"," It's not out of completely out of control here, but."
"2926480","2930220"," I guess I have one concern with rent control in Detroit would be. "
"2932260","2935680"," It's like it doesn't have what it needs yet."
"2936020","2938280"," Detroit doesn't have like the great schools yet."
"2938420","2939180"," They don't have the great. "
"2940820","2941820"," Transportation options."
"2941820","2943280"," They don't they haven't attracted."
"2944540","2948500"," A large company yet like an Amazon that they've been trying to do. "
"2949360","2951340"," Like a big tech force."
"2953420","2958100"," And the city, although it's in a comeback mode, it's not hasn't come back yet."
"2959240","2962240"," So I don't know that we're ready for rent control. "
"2963040","2965340"," I think we should at some point, but it's not."
"2965660","2966840"," It's not there yet."
"2972840","2976240"," So that was a that let me see what you guys are saying here. "
"2984740","2991490"," A small gap to the upside here at four thirty six flat."
"2992210","2993850"," Trading four thirty six forty nine."
"2994530","2995490"," Keep your eye on that gap. "
"2995710","2996930"," It's just above up here too."
"2997810","2999690"," There's one small gap right here."
"3009800","3011480"," There's a tiny gap right there. "
"3015100","3017240"," We also got to think about yesterday's high."
"3019160","3021870"," That was right there."
"3062360","3063220"," Let's see what else we got. "
"3063320","3064560"," We see a check with YouTube saying."
"3065980","3068280"," Oh, so Tampa and St. Pete's trying to do rent control."
"3068520","3069580"," You know, I lived in rent control. "
"3071280","3075480"," In two places in New York City and in Santa Monica."
"3078700","3081200"," And you know, what do you want to know about it?"
"3082080","3085580"," Like it can be like it's a it's a it's a weird thing."
"3085580","3088840"," It's like it has its place. "
"3091900","3095580"," And it can be very detrimental at the same time."
"3098400","3100160"," In Santa Monica, I paid."
"3100640","3102140"," This was a long, long time ago. "
"3102300","3108260"," I was paying three grand a month for rent in Santa Monica."
"3108400","3109700"," My apartment was a shittle."
"3110500","3112560"," It was a fucking shittle. "
"3112560","3116420"," And the landlord had no."
"3118020","3120340"," No, no wants to."
"3120740","3122700"," Or to improve the property. "
"3124120","3126000"," So that was frustrating."
"3127420","3132040"," And then of course you had people living on the same block as me that had been there for."
"3132840","3134420"," The combats. "
"3134620","3136180"," I want to say it combats gentrification."
"3137340","3140320"," But at the same time, those people never moved either."
"3140320","3142960"," They had a reason not to move, right?"
"3144360","3148740"," So it does it does work well at combating gentrification to some extent. "
"3150100","3153280"," But no one else could move into Santa Monica either."
"3153580","3155120"," Like it was really weird."
"3155320","3158120"," Like if you were poor, you couldn't move to Santa Monica. "
"3159240","3161620"," But if you were a holdover of poverty."
"3162900","3166780"," You could stay in Santa Monica for two decades."
"3167740","3174060"," So you'd see like multi general generation families living in these houses that were rent"
"3174060","3174520"," controlled. "
"3174660","3178060"," So it's really bizarre like like I get the idea behind it."
"3179880","3181120"," But I don't know."
"3182760","3185780"," I don't know if it should be a function of rent control. "
"3185940","3191680"," Maybe it's just be a function of your city or county owning more housing stock."
"3192320","3194300"," Rather than putting it on to a landlord."
"3194300","3196800"," You put it on the state, right?"
"3197420","3199420"," Or the county or the city or something like that. "
"3199500","3202820"," You build housing and it doesn't necessarily have to be public housing."
"3203380","3206380"," Or what would be considered."
"3207980","3209260"," What would be considered. "
"3210000","3212140"," What would look like public housing."
"3212600","3215860"," As a matter of fact, I lived in park city."
"3216820","3217960"," They didn't quite have. "
"3219220","3221160"," They didn't quite have rent control."
"3221160","3228840"," But they did have like a basket of housing options for."
"3229680","3233660"," Like teachers and firefighters and people that were. "
"3235080","3237440"," Functional to the city to live."
"3238400","3242760"," Maybe if maybe if the city bought a bunch of housing and then renovated it and then they."
"3243040","3245080"," They were able to offer this housing to. "
"3247080","3248600"," People I'd be fine with that."
"3255960","3257840"," Yeah, and here's the other side of it."
"3258080","3258840"," So I only do Airbnb. "
"3260180","3261840"," And when I do rent."
"3263160","3266260"," To section eight, section eight, Michigan is outstanding."
"3267740","3269800"," It's really, really, really outstanding. "
"3270520","3272640"," Especially it's great for the tenants."
"3273240","3275220"," And it's great for the landlord here."
"3275460","3277940"," So the options in Michigan as a landlord. "
"3279540","3284800"," You'd 100% from in my perspective is, is you go to section eight route."
"3285400","3286300"," Especially Detroit."
"3287460","3288820"," You get a guaranteed pay every month. "
"3288820","3294240"," Pay is outstanding from the state here and the requirements for my renters is high."
"3295320","3298640"," They've had like section eight reform of some kind in the state."
"3300040","3301800"," But I don't rent right now. "
"3301980","3302460"," I do Airbnb."
"3302920","3305440"," So I don't need to like I'm not concerned with it."
"3305440","3306500"," For myself. "
"3308720","3315660"," I take advantage of there not being a large infrastructure of nice hotels in the city."
"3316780","3321100"," But big, I guess it could affect me at some point."
"3323910","3325090"," Bookings are fine. "
"3325250","3325730"," I'm doing fine."
"3326010","3326490"," I don't."
"3327010","3330390"," I haven't experienced three quarters of what. "
"3331010","3333630"," Is is talked about on."
"3334950","3337790"," The Internet, but I don't do a bunch of shit either."
"3337790","3339750"," Like I'm, I'm, I'm a normal. "
"3340970","3345170"," Post like you don't see me, like I don't charge exuberant rates."
"3345350","3349950"," I don't charge hidden fees or hidden cleaning fees or any."
"3350210","3352130"," I don't, I don't, I don't deal with any of the. "
"3353110","3359130"," I've seen like, I've seen the bad renters and I've seen the bad landlords and."
"3359470","3360770"," Well, they're not landlords, but."
"3362850","3368310"," I've seen like the, I see the stuff in the public and I've never encountered that stuff. "
"3368950","3370930"," Just normal stuff that I've encountered."
"3371330","3371390"," So."
"3373050","3375130"," I've never had a, I've never had any problems. "
"3375530","3375930"," I don't know."
"3376290","3380390"," I've had one problem, but it was with a renter, not all my problems."
"3380590","3381150"," I've always been with renters. "
"3381910","3382550"," Always with renters."
"3383190","3388550"," And the only renters I have problems with are like rich people or people that profess to be rich."
"3389250","3390190"," With great credit. "
"3390490","3392130"," And then I have had problems with."
"3393930","3394670"," Professional renters."
"3395110","3397050"," I don't know if you know what those are, but. "
"3397710","3399730"," They only had one professional renter."
"3400590","3401950"," And they knew how to scam."
"3402250","3403410"," I don't know who they were talking to. "
"3403770","3406570"," I'm assuming that there's a, or what I've been told is that there's."
"3406870","3408670"," People that know how to professionally scam."
"3408670","3409070"," So. "
"3410090","3411090"," They've only run into that."
"3415370","3417010"," Who's trying to break higher right now."
"3421250","3423110"," No, bookings have not slowed down. "
"3423310","3427450"," I, I, I have like, I'm in like the sweetest spot I could be in right now."
"3428550","3430030"," So like Detroit's the weird thing."
"3430150","3431530"," They got like really nice hotels. "
"3432970","3434830"," In the downtown area, right?"
"3435170","3436050"," And then they have."
"3438730","3443310"," Detroit's surrounded with Metro Detroit and the surrounding communities."
"3445370","3447630"," Have hotels in them. "
"3447630","3449450"," But think about Detroit."
"3450790","3452550"," Almost like Washington DC."
"3454010","3455330"," There's, it's like three. "
"3455790","3457510"," Two thirds of a circle."
"3458510","3460410"," So if you're Detroit's kind of like."
"3461530","3462770"," Kind of like this. "
"3464970","3467350"," It's like a three, two thirds of a pie."
"3467690","3469490"," So this is like all water right here, right?"
"3470510","3472090"," This is like the D."
"3472090","3478230"," And then there's the Metro Detroit is around the outside of it."
"3478530","3480690"," So this hotel is out here. "
"3481750","3484970"," There's hotels right here, but there's nothing in here."
"3485710","3487450"," This whole area right here in the middle."
"3487650","3488270"," There's no hotels. "
"3488790","3490250"," It's like there's no hotels."
"3493110","3493950"," Anywhere in here."
"3496250","3499550"," And so because there's no hotels in here. "
"3501910","3503290"," There's a demand for."
"3504970","3506550"," There's a demand for Airbnb's."
"3507770","3510050"," Well, there's a great flight out of Detroit too. "
"3510190","3512530"," So if you're not, let's say you're, let's say you moved out of Detroit."
"3513790","3514950"," You take off, right?"
"3515250","3519350"," And you have some family members that never left and you want to come back for a family reunion."
"3522690","3525590"," You want to come back for a family reunion of some kind, right?"
"3525870","3526650"," You need a place to stay. "
"3526810","3529830"," You don't want to be staying out in the Metro or down at a casino hotel."
"3531330","3532710"," It's a good option for you."
"3532790","3533370"," Another option. "
"3534190","3537950"," It's for people that come to town for sick family members, family unions."
"3539670","3541070"," And then a lot of engineers."
"3542150","3542630"," So. "
"3543630","3546970"," Detroit is a, has, still has the big pre, of course, right?"
"3547250","3549310"," Still home of a American car making."
"3550250","3554530"," So you get engineers that come to town and then you get engineers that come to town and fix like"
"3554530","3555830"," gas pumps or."
"3556670","3560130"," Stores like, I'll get a lot of engineers that rent from us. "
"3561210","3566610"," So it'll be on, on business in the city for some, of some kind technicians, stuff like that,"
"3566670","3567450"," traveling technicians."
"3568190","3570870"," They'll stay at my house as I get a lot of those people too."
"3584540","3588360"," Yeah, see, we don't run, so we don't, like the traits are really weird place. "
"3588660","3590380"," I don't, I should talk more about Detroit."
"3591100","3594920"," So Detroit has very easy paths to own a home ownership."
"3594920","3598080"," If you want to own a home, you can own a home easily here. "
"3598400","3599620"," Detroit's a really weird enigma."
"3599800","3601760"," It's not a play enigma, it's a weird place like."
"3603700","3608140"," If you, like Detroit is trying to get people to move to it. "
"3608860","3613060"," And not with bullshit, like they're, they're actively trying to get you to move here."
"3613880","3615200"," And now they have high taxes."
"3615480","3616060"," That's one negative. "
"3616440","3618900"," And another negative to Detroit is the schools."
"3620200","3624700"," You, if you're going to raise kids, you basically go to private school or home school."
"3625400","3627860"," Now they do have some good homeschool options here. "
"3628420","3630460"," But they, but that's what your choices are."
"3631120","3634540"," They don't have the best infrastructure for biking."
"3635140","3637120"," They do, but it's not the best. "
"3637320","3638060"," They're working on it."
"3638120","3640020"," They're building bike bike lanes right now."
"3640620","3641360"," They got to give them that. "
"3642020","3649640"," The, I'm not commuting, but Boston train service sucks here."
"3652600","3654340"," Those, those are the glaring issues."
"3654720","3658460"," Like if I had said, if I had to say they were glaring issues, the big ones are schools. "
"3660340","3663240"," And, and travel, like how you travel."
"3664120","3665360"," Safety and how you travel."
"3666520","3667860"," The forms of travel that you take. "
"3668480","3670820"," Those are the two major issues right now."
"3670880","3676040"," But let's talk about jobs and homeownership to the city of Detroit, the city specifically."
"3677180","3680700"," If you want to learn a trade. "
"3681820","3685340"," If you want a college education, I don't care what it is."
"3686080","3688020"," And you move or live here in Detroit."
"3689060","3691680"," You can, you can go to any school you want near free. "
"3693380","3696060"," And some schools are, are completely free."
"3696240","3698700"," You can come here and learn a trade."
"3698800","3700900"," They've got gross strong unions here. "
"3701620","3704380"," They've got a strong schooling here for the trades."
"3705120","3707260"," So you can get a job here in a minute."
"3707500","3711240"," Now, if you're from somewhere else and you have been, you went to high school. "
"3711880","3712660"," Got yourself a degree."
"3713600","3714860"," Or some, some form of college."
"3715480","3716380"," There's a lot of work here. "
"3716660","3722860"," Another misnomer about Detroit is that there's no like high quality jobs here."
"3722980","3724100"," That's a misnomer as well."
"3724840","3727020"," There are tons of engineering jobs here. "
"3727560","3729280"," Tons of medical jobs here."
"3729560","3733760"," You've got one of the largest research universities in the nation here."
"3733760","3737520"," The University of Michigan, top 25 school in the country. "
"3738580","3740940"," So there's a ton of work here for, for people, right?"
"3741540","3745640"," Now, the second thing Detroit doesn't have a problem with, which you do have a problem with in a"
"3745640","3748240"," lot of rent control places, is housing."
"3749360","3754100"," Now, the barrier to buy a home here is fucking zero."
"3754900","3756340"," Anyone can buy a house here. "
"3756780","3758740"," You, you can find a way to buy a house here."
"3759360","3761620"," So it's not like you can't buy a home here."
"3762320","3767060"," So what's left over is people that want to rent. "
"3768360","3769540"," You get what I'm saying?"
"3770180","3778460"," So like, it's like the people that rent here, generally, not always, but generally want to rent a"
"3778460","3779020"," home."
"3779320","3785200"," Now, the other people that need homes that some of this rent control would be, would be people that"
"3785200","3788180"," can't, don't, can't buy a home, right?"
"3788180","3796620"," They can't get a job or they can't work or they have disabilities of some kind or the, whoever's"
"3796620","3799580"," happened to them in their lives, they can't own a home."
"3799760","3801360"," They're too old for whatever it might be. "
"3802200","3804100"," Now, these are the people that want to rent."
"3804700","3811520"," Now, right now, there's no shortage of rentals here for Detroiters and we've had a population"
"3811520","3812240"," decline here."
"3812240","3816740"," So, you know, like this city was built for millions of people. "
"3817040","3821800"," We're down to like 680 or 90,000 people, I think, right now."
"3822300","3824160"," So there's no shortage of rentals."
"3824680","3826740"," There's no shortage of homes to buy here. "
"3827440","3829720"," We don't have those issues here right now."
"3830140","3832880"," Now, there is a barrier to entry."
"3833900","3838520"," We do have higher rents here, but that is due to the reinvestment in this city. "
"3839080","3839960"," And that's not cheap."
"3839960","3841040"," It's not cheap."
"3842400","3845400"," You're not going to find that where you live in most cities. "
"3846520","3852740"," If your apartment building was built in the 90s or the 80s or the 70s, that's what you get."
"3853100","3854760"," And Detroit is not like that right now."
"3854880","3860420"," They're like tearing homes down and apartment homes down to the bare bones and rebuilding them up"
"3860420","3861260"," from scratch. "
"3862980","3864440"," So it's kind of weird, a nightmare."
"3864820","3867940"," And I get the idea of wanting to talk for rent control."
"3867940","3870480"," But I don't think we're there yet. "
"3870740","3871780"," I think it's early."
"3872200","3876400"," And when my biggest fear about rent control in Detroit is."
"3879200","3885520"," Is that it will stifle the development of the city and Detroit can't have that. "
"3886100","3887900"," I'm going to tell you right now, if Detroit."
"3888820","3891240"," Like Detroit didn't partake in."
"3891240","3895600"," Any of the any of the craziness that went down during COVID. "
"3895600","3897420"," We have protests here."
"3897640","3898920"," We don't have riots."
"3899400","3900260"," We don't have like. "
"3901160","3904120"," Like Detroit is like, we're going to sit this one out."
"3904720","3906740"," Like this past like five, 10 years."
"3907600","3908980"," We're going to sit this shit out. "
"3909620","3911760"," Traits had enough traits burned to the ground."
"3911820","3914160"," Detroit burned to the ground."
"3914700","3918480"," The only people that were left behind in the city of Detroit. "
"3918480","3920420"," The people that could not leave."
"3920680","3922340"," That's how bad it got in the city."
"3923380","3925680"," And I think Detroit is done with it. "
"3925840","3926820"," Traits like fuck this."
"3927020","3929460"," We're going to like Phoenix rise from the ashes."
"3931220","3932660"," So I don't know if it passes. "
"3932920","3934500"," I could be overreacting on this."
"3935380","3940260"," Now, if they want to have that conversation, a discussion over the next five years or 10 years, I'd"
"3940260","3941000"," be open to it."
"3941620","3948100"," But this city needs a lot more than what it has to be talking about rent control is my point. "
"3948100","3952120"," It needs like more investment, more industry, more tech."
"3953560","3956200"," To come into the city to even begin to have that discussion."
"3959900","3960940"," Property taxes. "
"3961540","3962520"," Now that's a weird thing too."
"3962800","3967320"," So it can be through the fucking roof for a two or $300,000 home."
"3967940","3969540"," But if you buy a home. "
"3970520","3975820"," That's not been a praise that $200 to $300,000 and you renovate that home."
"3976620","3977180"," Not so bad."
"3977340","3978280"," But when you go to sell it. "
"3979520","3980540"," It's through the roof."
"3980880","3984760"," But at the same time, does it matter to some people?"
"3985280","3986880"," Some people, it doesn't matter."
"3987180","3988680"," A lot of people that move to Detroit. "
"3989520","3991940"," Now, some people get caught in that trap too."
"3992100","3995300"," Their realtors don't tell them that their taxes are going to be through the roof."
"3995540","4002720"," But what I find from a lot of people that move to the city that want the house that's already"
"4002720","4006400"," been renovated or re renovated or restored or any of that kind of stuff. "
"4007240","4008740"," They don't care about the taxes."
"4009060","4013100"," They are moving here specifically to help the city get back on its feet."
"4013380","4014980"," Most people that moved to Detroit. "
"4016080","4019480"," Or have some kind of altruism going on in the background."
"4020060","4021620"," You either want to see the city come back."
"4021820","4023020"," They want to get it on the ground floor. "
"4024500","4028160"," So the tax the tax hits that you take aren't as bad."
"4028780","4031900"," If you buy a house that needs the improvement."
"4032600","4036140"," And the people that are buying, they're like, I'm kind of come to the city and buy a two or"
"4036140","4036820"," $300,000. "
"4037040","4039720"," They can usually afford a million dollar home."
"4040640","4042660"," They're already getting a fucking steal."
"4043060","4046060"," It's like you buy a $300,000 home in Detroit right now. "
"4046580","4047980"," That home would cost you."
"4049720","4059620"," $1 to $2 million minimum in any other city like New York, Detroit, Austin, San Francisco, $1"
"4059620","4060260"," to $2 million."
"4061000","4066680"," So most of these, these people move, they're making a lot of money. "
"4066940","4068200"," It's still a deal."
"4068560","4069460"," It's still a deal."
"4070400","4071400"," It's still dirt cheap. "
"4076960","4080040"," Did I get my message, Jared?"
"4080400","4081040"," No, I did not."
"4081600","4082260"," Do you want to?"
"4082440","4083000"," What did you send?"
"4083260","4083740"," I haven't saw."
"4084040","4085780"," I was in the doctors office yesterday. "
"4086260","4087840"," I was drugged out of my mind."
"4089300","4092360"," Got back yesterday, slept, slept, slept, slept and slept."
"4093520","4095920"," So Jared, oh, you did email me, Jared. "
"4096160","4096540"," Hold on here."
"4097720","4098920"," Let me check right now, brother."
"4099220","4099500"," Let me look. "
"4102760","4104460"," Did you send me a DM, Jared?"
"4108200","4108920"," Oh, yeah."
"4109319","4109740"," Here he is."
"4110060","4110720"," I got you, Jared. "
"4111700","4112319"," Hold on, brother."
"4115250","4116370"," I got your name here, man."
"4116609","4117410"," I'm going to look you up right now. "
"4144399","4146439"," For some reason, I'm not seeing you here, man."
"4146560","4146800"," Hold on."
"4165279","4166300"," No, Jared. "
"4166580","4170160"," Hey, Jared, go to your Jared, do me a solid."
"4173490","4174810"," Jared, do me a solid."
"4175069","4179490"," Go to your YouTube home, right?"
"4180149","4181630"," Whatever your YouTube home is. "
"4182930","4188090"," Go to the website address bar"
"4188090","4193930"," at the top."
"4193930","4195430"," And send it via DM and Twitter."
"4196530","4201670"," The at Jared is not the, I need your full, like, YouTube. "
"4203590","4207570"," Like mine is YouTube.com, backslash, captain, Jim James."
"4209770","4214990"," So whatever that whole thing is, copy it and send it to be via DM, brother."
"4215750","4216710"," And I'll put you in right now. "
"4223640","4224480"," Hey, Stacy."
"4224480","4224860"," Good morning."
"4224860","4225260"," How are you?"
"4231480","4232320"," Utah, baby. "
"4233420","4234500"," Utah does rule."
"4234940","4236800"," I love that say the only thing that sucks about Utah."
"4237960","4238960"," The food sucks. "
"4243300","4246520"," The food is stuck in an inch of dimensional time warp."
"4248760","4251080"," But other than that, the state is fucking phenomenal."
"4251660","4253720"," And I don't like the booze situation either. "
"4254440","4254900"," Sorry."
"4254900","4255740"," That's just shit."
"4255920","4256640"," So like 1950. "
"4275290","4277370"," No, you'll take me out to good food in Utah."
"4277810","4279170"," Oh, no, I don't know, man."
"4282350","4285070"," I've eaten at a lot of great Utah restaurants. "
"4285550","4287510"," You don't see it feels tired to me."
"4288330","4289910"," I go to Utah every year."
"4290190","4292930"," It always feels so, it always feels kind of tired. "
"4294590","4298210"," I could be wrong on that, but it does, dude."
"4298270","4299470"," It feels tired to me."
"4301710","4302990"," We know what it is too. "
"4303210","4306990"," It's the, it's the ethnic food that does it."
"4307670","4308610"," It really is."
"4308830","4310970"," It's like the, maybe I'm just being spoiled. "
"4312270","4313530"," I gotta, I gotta give that to Detroit."
"4313770","4316590"," Detroit's got, like, huge immigrant population."
"4317690","4319590"," And the food is just phenomenal. "
"4323570","4325630"," It's like, do you have a large Vietnamese population?"
"4326210","4327810"," Do you have a large Indian population?"
"4328830","4330630"," Do you have a large Chaldean population?"
"4331170","4335210"," Do you have a large Mexican population there?"
"4335390","4336430"," But Detroit has that too."
"4337710","4341110"," Like Detroit's got like, and dude, the African American cuisine is baller."
"4341630","4343290"," Like, do you have all those cuisines in Utah?"
"4343950","4344950"," I'm going to go with no. "
"4344950","4346150"," I used to live there."
"4351070","4351710"," Yeah, yeah."
"4351890","4354990"," I can't say there, there's good Mexican food in, in Utah. "
"4361660","4366560"," Yeah, there, there, the liquor laws, like, I used to find them, like, like a decade ago."
"4366720","4368060"," I was like, oh, this is kind of cute."
"4368240","4369140"," You can get around the laws. "
"4370300","4371960"," Then just became kind of tiresome."
"4372760","4377260"," Like, I can go out right now anywhere and put a beer and a shot of whiskey on my table."
"4377260","4378960"," You can't do that in Utah, can you?"
"4379300","4383020"," Can you have a beer and a shot of liquor on the table in Utah?"
"4384360","4385420"," I don't think you can. "
"4385600","4386380"," A full-strength beer."
"4386620","4387800"," Can you have a full-strength beer?"
"4388060","4394060"," And then another thing that always bothered me about Utah, they take the full-strength beer."
"4394260","4399740"," I don't know if they do this anymore, but when I was nice to live there, they would store the"
"4399740","4401400"," full-strength beer warm. "
"4402280","4408780"," So, however it got to Utah, if you got a full-strength beer, they would stick it out in the"
"4408780","4410560"," warehouses warm."
"4411680","4413640"," So, it was always, like, skunked beer."
"4414920","4416540"," You guys know that or no?"
"4419820","4424040"," And then they had a rule where you couldn't, like, every shot had to be measured. "
"4424760","4425840"," So, that was another way to think."
"4425920","4428260"," You couldn't have a whole bunch of cool Utah rules."
"4428260","4429920"," I think I know most of them. "
"4430980","4435460"," If a drink called for certain measures, you couldn't do the exact measures."
"4436800","4442320"," Now, of course, like, I'm not talking about a Long Island ST with five liquors in it."
"4443680","4449620"," But if you tried to measure a classic cocktail of some kind, you couldn't. "
"4451880","4452360"," Right?"
"4452640","4455740"," And you've got some, like, you've got some, like, high-tech measure and stuff you've got to do."
"4456660","4464300"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
"4464440","4465640"," It's really bizarre. "
"4466360","4467580"," It's very ancient."
"4468520","4469780"," I love Utah, though."
"4469940","4473560"," Let me preface this by saying that I fucking love the state of Utah. "
"4474320","4477540"," But the liquor laws are absurd, like, straight absurd."
"4478760","4479920"," And let me ask you another question."
"4480960","4485020"," You guys were supposed to pass CBD, right?"
"4485540","4491980"," It's like most of the country drugs have been decriminalized. "
"4492620","4499720"," Now, I'm not a drug user, but like the, like, throwing someone in jail for a gram or two of"
"4499720","4499920"," marijuana."
"4500660","4501680"," I'm not a for that."
"4501780","4502080"," I'm sorry. "
"4502220","4503040"," I can't be for that."
"4505580","4507260"," I can't, can't do it, man."
"4507660","4509020"," I can't. "
"4510420","4512840"," Like, you got a gram of marijuana on you?"
"4513040","4514080"," Oh, shit."
"4515600","4516440"," You in trouble."
"4517500","4518180"," Can't do it. "
"4520080","4522080"," But they were going to pass CBDs, right?"
"4522240","4523780"," I thought they were open to passing that."
"4524980","4529400"," Like that, like any kind of reform like that, even just decriminalization of that stuff."
"4537350","4538170"," I'm looking again. "
"4538350","4539510"," Let me check right now, brother."
"4539710","4540430"," I'll check one more time."
"4541230","4542390"," Let me check, brother. "
"4542590","4542870"," I got you."
"4548880","4549980"," Oh, yeah, brother."
"4550220","4550920"," I got you now, man. "
"4551760","4552120"," Yep."
"4552520","4553140"," Hold on a second, man."
"4555700","4556840"," Let me see if this works, bro. "
"4567200","4568380"," One quick second, man."
"4577840","4578520"," Community."
"4583490","4585810"," You choose been acting really weird. "
"4585810","4586770"," Strange, bro."
"4597820","4599900"," Yeah, I'm having really weird."
"4621360","4622400"," Well, bro. "
"4640170","4641670"," Jared, is that you, man?"
"4641870","4643170"," Are you a soccer player, brother?"
"4657660","4659340"," No matching users."
"4697240","4698160"," What's so weird?"
"4723250","4725950"," Jared, make a comment on YouTube right now, will you?"
"4727150","4728710"," I'm going to see if I got you in there or not."
"4736580","4738400"," Oh, yeah, Jared, you're back, brother. "
"4738840","4739400"," I got you."
"4742120","4743020"," You're back in, man."
"4744180","4745000"," I got you, man. "
"4751360","4752980"," You should be good to go, brother."
"4759280","4761300"," Yeah, yeah, you're good, man."
"4761540","4761920"," I got you. "
"4772200","4773500"," Yeah, they had some changes."
"4773980","4778340"," You taught, used to be like, I think they used to use many bottles or something years ago."
"4779220","4783360"," And then, yeah, this looks like a trap, dude. "
"4783840","4788980"," Like, so fucking glad I'm on calls right now."
"4802580","4804680"," No, Jared, you weren't interrupting the stream, man."
"4804780","4805080"," Not at all. "
"4805600","4806840"," You're doing just fine."
"4809220","4810620"," Not liking my new chair."
"4812400","4813820"," Not liking this new chair. "
"4813980","4814780"," I think I got to return it."
"4815040","4815900"," It's too big for me."
"4815960","4817080"," It's fucking huge. "
"4823960","4825920"," Oh, hey, by the way, trader podcast."
"4826320","4831780"," I've got a, I've got a meme for you, man, to work on, brother."
"4832880","4834560"," I'm going to send it to you via DM. "
"4845530","4847790"," So, what would you trader podcast?"
"4848170","4849350"," What tick are you looking at?"
"4850670","4852190"," What tick are you looking at, brother?"
"4856120","4858540"," This looks like, let me look at the 30 minute chart here."
"4861420","4863940"," Let me get some context for context from you."
"4864580","4866940"," Yeah, this looks like consolidation, dude. "
"4869580","4871380"," The one and the half looks fine."
"4878000","4879520"," Half minute looks great here."
"4880280","4880540"," Arlies. "
"4880980","4881480"," It's okay."
"4896770","4897130"," NVDA."
"4897650","4898890"," All right, let's look at NVDA. "
"4917830","4922810"," So, Jared, if I was looking at NVDA, right, the first thing that I'm going to look at, let me"
"4922810","4923730"," make this smaller."
"4933100","4938740"," First thing I'm always looking for, Jared is the, so if you've got the tool at home, I'm going to"
"4938740","4940000"," show you what I look at, okay?"
"4941800","4948680"," But what I'm looking for, and this is a one day chart here, okay?"
"4948860","4951140"," This is specifically for NVDA."
"4952400","4955740"," I always like to buy dips or the daily trigger when it's down here. "
"4956240","4958220"," Okay, so this means the most to me."
"4962260","4965920"," I always like buying dips down here, regardless of where the market's going."
"4966680","4968500"," You just had one down here, right?"
"4968720","4969360"," Nice little dip by. "
"4969500","4970140"," This is good to see."
"4970140","4972500"," Usually results in some upside moves."
"4973380","4980320"," But you do want to pay attention to the decline of the weekly chart here and the monthly chart. "
"4980880","4990820"," We discussed this last week when I was talking about banks and also banks and also"
"4990820","4997680"," Netflix and we talked about Netflix and another ticker I forget which one it was."
"4997860","5003820"," I was discussing with you that these banks should have a good earnings and then be sold."
"5004980","5011720"," So just like intermittently for earnings season to run up into their earnings looks bullish on"
"5011720","5012100"," Nvidia. "
"5012800","5018980"," I have real concerns with this over here and this over here, meaning that whatever the good"
"5018980","5021560"," earnings season is, it'll likely get sold off."
"5021560","5024660"," Now, does this matter right now?"
"5024880","5025420"," Probably not."
"5025580","5031240"," Probably matters more towards December 1st, January, February. "
"5032840","5039160"," So the idea here would be that whatever upside potential we have for this Q4, I'm going to expect"
"5039160","5044360"," it to get sold off into, you know, over here."
"5044360","5051480"," This is making a little bit too dramatic, but here's your December right here."
"5052660","5055460"," So whatever this move is should be short-lived. "
"5056380","5058860"," Okay, and that's from this weekly and monthly here."
"5059240","5061340"," We have a series of declining lows."
"5062420","5064620"," Now, does that mean we can't squeeze up to new highs?"
"5064880","5070000"," No, this daily trigger, you'll always see this daily trigger get bought even if we're in decline. "
"5070000","5073960"," So that's what I'm looking at on NVDA right now, okay?"
"5074680","5080740"," Now, on the 30-minute chart, if I switch to the 30-minute chart, we're actually trading this here"
"5080740","5082360"," on NVDA."
"5084980","5086720"," This is positive here."
"5086880","5090040"," This daily trigger is a series of higher lows on velocity. "
"5091320","5093040"," This is positive right here."
"5093220","5097940"," A series of higher lows and we're negative velocity for the hourly trigger."
"5098340","5099580"," This is actually bullish. "
"5100140","5102080"," This is bullish on a higher time frame."
"5102220","5104160"," This is bullish for like two, three weeks."
"5105060","5107040"," Usually, it could be one day, pay on price. "
"5107860","5111100"," It could be anywhere from one day to three weeks, but this is a bullish."
"5111460","5112280"," You want to be buying this."
"5112640","5116460"," This is bullish here, this is bullish here, and this is bullish here. "
"5117240","5122780"," So for swing trading, this is what you want to be looking for is to buy this dip."
"5122780","5128010"," Now, saying that, saying that, right?"
"5129630","5132750"," What I'm looking for here, like, can I buy this dip?"
"5132970","5136110"," Can I buy this bounce here in NVDA?"
"5136290","5136950"," Not necessarily."
"5138250","5145290"," What I'm always looking for to enter a trade is I've got those, I've got those three requirements,"
"5145290","5145810"," right?"
"5147910","5150730"," So I got right now, I got three requirements. "
"5150730","5154590"," Is price holding above the one in five minute trigger?"
"5154950","5155350"," No."
"5156170","5157070"," Did it squeeze?"
"5157330","5158250"," Well, let's start with the baseline."
"5158530","5159170"," Did it squeeze up?"
"5159330","5159490"," Yes. "
"5160010","5160310"," That's good."
"5161190","5161430"," Right?"
"5162170","5164710"," Coming back down now to check it's one in five minute."
"5166050","5169010"," So not until we get across, right?"
"5169270","5169730"," Am I bullish?"
"5169990","5171930"," But even then, I'm only bullish to 448. "
"5173870","5174950"," Maybe 454."
"5176130","5180710"," What I really want to see though here is, you can enter data."
"5180710","5181730"," I'm looking for a trade trade this if you wanted. "
"5183790","5186110"," It's really like, hey, Cap, I want to take this trade here."
"5186650","5191170"," You can, but I'd be looking for the rip up."
"5191590","5192530"," Come back down. "
"5193330","5193990"," You get the cross."
"5195190","5196850"," That's all in what your poison is."
"5198150","5199590"," Like, is it a day trade?"
"5204040","5205260"," Is it just a day trade?"
"5207440","5210200"," Let's see the white cross here, right?"
"5210440","5210800"," Over the red. "
"5211680","5211720"," Right?"
"5211720","5212860"," You come back up."
"5213000","5214940"," I'd be interested in this trade right here."
"5216480","5219980"," So, let me see if I can brush off some of that out. "
"5220160","5220440"," Hold on here."
"5224940","5226720"," See the initial squeeze here, right?"
"5234830","5236310"," You get the cross up here."
"5241840","5242140"," Right?"
"5242560","5243980"," You want this right here?"
"5245240","5245940"," Down here?"
"5246440","5247780"," I'd take that trade right there. "
"5249240","5252280"," But you're only good to 449.01, that's it."
"5252980","5254180"," Likely it's going to come back down."
"5255580","5258900"," You're going to need this hourly trigger to come down here to help out. "
"5260240","5262100"," And consolidate for a rip."
"5263120","5265040"," So, the bigger move is up here."
"5267200","5271340"," Now, all of this work that potentially can be done. "
"5272160","5276820"," It'd be like, yeah, if you want to trade that, you can, but in reality, you want that back check"
"5276820","5277400"," here done."
"5278160","5280440"," And you want to get underneath the hourly trigger."
"5280840","5282260"," Get underneath the daily trigger. "
"5282760","5284800"," Get the one and the five going up there."
"5284800","5286720"," And then that would be the juicy trade."
"5286760","5288340"," That's the one that you're looking for. "
"5288860","5293120"," It's like you're waiting for all of this to happen for the big trade to come up."
"5293620","5295720"," And I'm going to show you another example of this right here, okay?"
"5296380","5298100"," I'm going to show you another example of that right now."
"5298240","5300580"," So, see that hourly, it's above the daily. "
"5301040","5302460"," You want the hourly to come back down and help."
"5303160","5304600"," You're about to start squeezing up in here."
"5304840","5306800"," And we just looked at one that had that happen. "
"5307360","5309800"," We just looked at DLTR, right?"
"5309800","5316580"," And DLTR, you can see it right here, right?"
"5318880","5321760"," You can see the hourly trigger helping out right here."
"5322340","5327860"," So, if you can get that hourly trigger to come back down, you can get that hourly trigger to come"
"5327860","5334140"," back down, swoop up, and pick up price on NVDA."
"5335100","5336460"," It should be a great trade for you. "
"5337160","5341320"," If you want to know my take on NVDA right now, I think it's a dip buy."
"5341320","5342460"," Okay, that's a dip buy."
"5343120","5346800"," And you're giving a gift today to buy that's weekly trigger down here. "
"5347020","5353720"," So, the one thing I would say in this, if you're like, hey, I bought a dip on DLTR on"
"5353720","5354340"," NVDA."
"5354340","5358620"," One thing I would say to you in this is don't get caught on the downside move over here."
"5358620","5364140"," So, as long as you're holding here at 438, you should be good to go. "
"5364880","5366220"," It stops below 438."
"5370760","5375780"," Below 438, but if you're bouncing up here, consolidate, and then you get you move up there."
"5376560","5380380"," And the call spread is probably your best trade here. "
"5380580","5381960"," Call spread probably best trade."
"5384240","5386580"," We got spoos squeezing higher right now."
"5387480","5397190"," Spoos now trading 436.05. They just closed the gap down here. "
"5398290","5405570"," Extremely bullish here looking to trade 437.56. If you look down below that gap was almost closed."
"5406490","5408330"," Not quite as still a here."
"5409190","5410230"," Look over here. "
"5411390","5415810"," Still a tiny bit of gap right here."
"5415930","5416630"," Tiny bit left."
"5418010","5424090"," You get the rest of this gap here at 436.14. Watch the algorithms go in there and take that"
"5424090","5424310"," out. "
"5442910","5443430"," Yeah."
"5445110","5452230"," It's tough to say like personally on NVDA right."
"5453110","5457530"," It's weird like as long as you know the steps you can take the trade. "
"5458690","5463250"," And then on that same step process when you squeeze through that daily trigger."
"5464110","5467510"," You're going to want to see it come back down and retest the daily in the hourly trigger."
"5468240","5471070"," And you'll have stability in NVDA at that point. "
"5477030","5481150"," Yeah, I like I always like so if you try to jump in on like a swing trade that's one"
"5481150","5482710"," day to 30 days."
"5483030","5490390"," You want to see that hourly velocity at minus 25 minus 50 somewhere in there."
"5491050","5495910"," Now it being in VDA minus 50 is not hard to achieve. "
"5495910","5501470"," And you've got the you've got the you've got the daily velocity on your side too."
"5508390","5511650"," You know, so I started answering that post on Friday."
"5512390","5513850"," And I took off. "
"5514050","5514370"," I went out."
"5514770","5517050"," I posted something about."
"5518010","5521390"," About about telling people your positioning right on fintuit. "
"5524390","5528990"," Now I was answering questions and I wound up going out again Friday night."
"5529770","5533650"," And so I took off, but I didn't get back to answer a lot of the questions."
"5533910","5536450"," I did notice that it got a lot of traction. "
"5536810","5539310"," So I don't even know what was said in that post."
"5539630","5545750"," I need to go back and check that post and find out exactly what was said because I don't know"
"5545750","5546890"," what happened in that post."
"5547090","5553510"," I honestly got to have not gone back and read the entire comments yet. "
"5553910","5556930"," I'm going to, but I haven't yet."
"5556930","5564230"," So I don't know what was said in that in that post on truly 100%."
"5564230","5567470"," I don't even know what it devolved into. "
"5567710","5571770"," I should have gone back and checked because it got what did it get?"
"5571930","5573330"," Like a hundred comments or something."
"5574690","5578630"," But I figured I figured by posting that what I thought about."
"5579390","5582810"," I think started to happen like DCP was in there. "
"5582810","5588230"," You made a comment and some really great traders had begun to take."
"5588570","5591370"," What was fascinating to me was this."
"5592970","5601390"," Twitter is the kind of place where if you have one follower or a hundred followers, no one pays"
"5601390","5602530"," attention to you, right?"
"5603810","5605510"," And that can become frustrating. "
"5607550","5613230"," Twitter, you do this thing where you say, follow these people, right?"
"5613970","5615130"," I trust these people."
"5615590","5616890"," I give them my sale of approval."
"5621950","5623490"," And you know, that's all great. "
"5623650","5625050"," I think that I think that has its place."
"5625750","5627690"," And I think I think it's a good thing to do."
"5628030","5632650"," Like, hey, these people I really trust value their opinion or this piece. "
"5632650","5636770"," People are funny as fuck or if you're in the cars, follow this person."
"5636910","5638870"," You're into this, follow that person."
"5639570","5640770"," I think that's all cool shit. "
"5643210","5647950"," So what I was thinking about more was I bet I was like, at the time, I was like, I"
"5647950","5651950"," bet if I make this post, it's going to piss some people off, anger some people."
"5652190","5658070"," But it's probably going to pull out people that don't care."
"5658570","5659550"," Like, they'll be like, fuck that. "
"5659690","5660950"," I don't care how many followers I got."
"5661550","5664910"," And I'll tell you what my, what, how I'm positioned, right?"
"5665110","5667990"," And then it's going to pull out a lot of people that don't have any followers."
"5669130","5670750"," That give up their positioning. "
"5671410","5674790"," And the fascinating part of that post to me was."
"5676270","5681630"," That the fascinating part of that post to me was that you would get."
"5683070","5684370"," High follow accounts. "
"5684730","5686590"," Be honest with you."
"5686810","5687310"," Just honesty."
"5688470","5693570"," I've got no position or I've got some position or I don't care if I'm wrong. "
"5694090","5694930"," And that's kind of cool."
"5695710","5700270"," You want people, you want to know people that don't care if they're wrong."
"5700670","5702190"," Don't care to tell you they're positioning. "
"5703170","5704910"," Don't care in advance, right?"
"5705790","5710750"," And then the other side of it is you can find people with low follow accounts that are great"
"5710750","5711930"," fucking investors and traders."
"5711930","5721910"," And sure enough, there were people that I trust that posted their bearishness or bullishness or"
"5721910","5725730"," theta, theta ish, theta ishness."
"5726490","5735630"," And then there were people that posted that with low follows and sounded like they knew what they"
"5735630","5736430"," were talking about. "
"5736570","5738530"," So I was like, oh, this guy's got one follower."
"5739410","5743270"," And he's posting like someone with a hundred thousand followers."
"5745350","5750390"," And, you know, he doesn't care because he doesn't have a hundred thousand followers, right?"
"5750770","5752410"," So I'm going to follow that guy. "
"5752870","5755310"," I thought if you go back and look at the post, right?"
"5756290","5760630"," If you look at back of that post from Friday, there's, it's probably a nice."
"5761950","5766030"," Well of good people to follow is that that was the point for the post was."
"5766910","5770830"," To give people the opportunity to read through it and be like, I'm going to follow this one and"
"5770830","5772210"," that one and this one and that one. "
"5773010","5775830"," And I'm betting that some people were pissed off."
"5776270","5781570"," I'm betting some people didn't realize that if they had high follows that they probably would have"
"5781570","5784630"," gained a lot of followers by posting in that post."
"5785970","5790310"," So by commenting, I think if you were, if you've got to have a hundred thousand followers, you"
"5790310","5795090"," should have posted and been like, I'm short, I'm flat, or I was bearish, but I'm flat, whatever. "
"5795230","5795750"," It didn't matter."
"5796710","5800770"," And you probably would have gained a lot of followers by that fourth, fourth rightness."
"5801070","5801090"," So. "
"5802090","5802670"," I don't know."
"5802830","5803430"," I thought it was kind of cool."
"5805330","5806150"," Ain't no good morning. "
"5806290","5806530"," How are you?"
"5809820","5810180"," Yeah."
"5810280","5810900"," Thanks for saying something."
"5811060","5811440"," Trader podcast. "
"5812300","5817140"," And I, as a matter of fact, I brought, I spoke to you on, on it because I was like,"
"5817140","5819020"," Hey, Trader podcast is a great fucking follow."
"5819480","5821400"," You got what, three, four thousand followers."
"5821680","5823360"," So I was like, I was like, I like following you. "
"5824060","5826260"," I don't know why anyone else wouldn't want to follow you either."
"5830640","5831700"," What's by doing grinding?"
"5832360","5833440"," That's all it's doing right now."
"5833640","5834880"," Just fucking grinding, man. "
"5835780","5837440"," Just grinding right now."
"5838060","5839020"," Love all grinding."
"5841990","5842630"," Oh, Andy. "
"5842930","5843850"," Did Andy respond to me?"
"5845250","5846850"," I got to respond to Andy then."
"5847930","5848950"," Cause Andy's fucking awesome."
"5850050","5851390"," I fucking love that guy. "
"5851730","5852590"," I love Andy constant."
"5852590","5853570"," Love him."
"5854890","5856410"," People shit out him all the time. "
"5856410","5858930"," And I think he's, I think he's a fucking, I think he's fucking great."
"5860530","5862010"," A smart, he's great."
"5862490","5865550"," He has no reason or need to post on Twitter. "
"5866230","5868130"," And I love everything that that guy posts."
"5878050","5879750"," Yeah, Jimmy, you're stuck on that."
"5879890","5881690"," I'm on that same four forty four, bro. "
"5881970","5883250"," I'm going to show you guys something here."
"5883350","5883950"," Give me a quick second."
"5884670","5888290"," Well, we're going to go over some technical stuff for you guys right now. "
"5889030","5892870"," So Jimmy is talking about forty four, four zero."
"5893050","5894930"," And there's a reason why he's talking about it."
"5895470","5896990"," We're going to go over it right now. "
"5897630","5898510"," Why that is."
"5899010","5900450"," Why it's such a beacon."
"5911540","5912980"," And I'll show you a couple. "
"5914380","5916560"," Let's see if I can show you guys a couple of things here."
"5920680","5925300"," You know, we, we are coming into end of month here and singing."
"5943900","5948920"," We can bring this over here and just show you this in the bottom left hand side of your screen. "
"5955840","5960100"," I don't know if you can see this at home, but you get the gist of it."
"5960320","5962300"," If I pointed out to you, whoop, hold on."
"5966130","5971270"," And this green bar right here, if you follow my cursor, this green bar. "
"5973410","5976350"," Right there is a magnet for us right now."
"5976350","5979990"," That is exactly four four four zero."
"5981730","5984630"," Yeah, so that one right there four four four zero. "
"5984970","5987490"," And this is your net gamma in the marketplace."
"5988530","5990530"," I'm going to show you something else here in just a minute."
"5997250","6001650"," Let me do one quick second and we're going to go to SP at now. "
"6001750","6002130"," We're going to go to."
"6005500","6007380"," Gamma right now in the marketplace."
"6009460","6010980"," We go to SPX. "
"6014060","6017020"," And just let me change the input the."
"6026160","6028440"," Put in these new gamma levels here, hold on."
"6037680","6041060"," So just if so, this is SPX right now. "
"6041080","6042280"," I've got a gamma chart up."
"6048400","6051540"," And you can see that magnet up there, right?"
"6052520","6055080"," You see this gamma flip right here, a parked on it."
"6055560","6059660"," And there's a large node up here at four four hundred. "
"6060720","6062000"," On SPX."
"6062240","6064700"," So keep your eyes on that as the target."
"6065340","6067680"," And you're seeing all this buying pressure here. "
"6068320","6071280"," Trying to push us up into that thirty four."
"6071800","6075300"," Forty four four four four zero right here."
"6075700","6078880"," There should be some some large resistance up there. "
"6079420","6081000"," Now, can we break above that level?"
"6081820","6083900"," Yeah, yeah, we can get above that level."
"6084060","6088480"," Your next major resistance is four four five zero."
"6089240","6093120"," And that's that giant gap that was left behind over here. "
"6093440","6096840"," This is back on Wednesday the twentieth."
"6097760","6100800"," This is right at sixteen hundred."
"6100960","6103780"," So four p.m. two p.m. on Wednesday the twentieth. "
"6104980","6107260"," So if you want to look at spy, right?"
"6116890","6119470"," And that's this whole thing right here."
"6120090","6122410"," This is that whole move down."
"6122590","6123990"," So that's four forty four. "
"6123990","6129610"," You can see like all this right here is what everybody's on about."
"6129870","6132110"," So all the racing, all of this stuff right here."
"6133670","6138650"," So that's what they're trying to do is buy all this stuff right here, right?"
"6138890","6142270"," You got your nice little full flag right here, right?"
"6142790","6143530"," Bam, bam, bam. "
"6143850","6147870"," Came down and now looking to launch to this upside."
"6147870","6152430"," And solid range of consolidation call spread is the way to go."
"6153070","6157010"," And then up in here you'll get your your tag above. "
"6157310","6159550"," Now there is one thing to be wary of this."
"6159890","6164450"," This is spy right now, but I want you to be wary of."
"6165090","6167350"," You get the four fifty one up here. "
"6170280","6171740"," Here's your next one above."
"6174260","6175760"," Now we're not looking at the."
"6177740","6179040"," We're not looking at the. "
"6180780","6185640"," Camera right now in SPX, but the gamutist PX is saying bloodbath, right?"
"6186120","6191360"," And the reality is that you're looking for this and then the daily trigger to hold it and then pull"
"6191360","6195300"," it back up here to get that second bullet for fifty two."
"6196120","6197800"," Let's look at SPX really quick."
"6202750","6203390"," So. "
"6208240","6212520"," See this gap right back here and then this gap right back here so you'd have."
"6219500","6223200"," That right there and then this one up here."
"6224960","6233380"," And you'd think that this is the you would think that you would think that we're going to trade"
"6233380","6234120"," this right. "
"6234120","6237420"," And then swoop up and trade this."
"6237640","6242840"," But the reality is there's a hidden node right here and this is where the trap is for bulls."
"6243980","6246120"," That's forty four five zero. "
"6246140","6247580"," So there's a trap right there."
"6247640","6255100"," It looks like Doug shit, but there's a trap right here at four four four four four four five zero"
"6255100","6258480"," at one hundred sixteen million nodes."
"6258480","6264620"," So maybe we squeeze this and then break this and then we actually get the major cell. "
"6265340","6269640"," So keep your eye on four four five zero and SPX right here."
"6270620","6273820"," And then you're going to have a hard time getting up there that forty five hundred."
"6274900","6277080"," Or that consolidation that you need. "
"6278700","6279540"," Hold on here."
"6297800","6299320"," Yeah, so that's right up here."
"6299520","6301400"," That's four four four zero. "
"6304740","6307440"," Now trading four three eight forty seven."
"6308300","6311300"," We have forty three seven fifty eight."
"6315870","6316910"," Right there. "
"6317050","6317570"," That's our one."
"6318250","6321210"," And then our two to the upside we have."
"6325070","6326790"," Four three nine sixteen. "
"6328250","6328770"," There."
"6356020","6356940"," Or two."
"6389340","6392680"," Starting to break above that resistance that we had back here. "
"6392800","6394220"," Check out all this volatility right."
"6394340","6396240"," All these sellers about to get schools out."
"6397980","6402500"," About to get schools in out right now trying to trade that four thirty seven fifty eight. "
"6425580","6435350"," I need to"
"6435350","6436630"," raise my chair up or something."
"6436850","6437590"," I'm not feeling it."
"6437930","6438630"," Hold on a second here. "
"6439330","6449650"," I'm not happy"
"6449650","6450930"," with my new chair."
"6451150","6451810"," I'm not liking it."
"6452370","6453010"," It's too big. "
"6453650","6456010"," I don't like this."
"6466440","6467220"," Morning David."
"6467480","6467840"," How are you?"
"6468240","6474980"," Good to see you brother. "
"6474980","6476740"," You're waiting for a twelve o'clock right."
"6478380","6480180"," You're right waiting for twelve one o'clock."
"6480200","6481540"," I retained some of that. "
"6482860","6485160"," Some of that class you gave me the other day."
"6486440","6488720"," David AMS gave me a class on Friday."
"6489780","6491720"," So I've been taking classes with him. "
"6497520","6499720"," Yeah, I don't feel like I'm in a commanding position."
"6500160","6501060"," I don't feel right."
"6501260","6502380"," This chair doesn't feel right. "
"6503600","6504960"," It's not doing it for me."
"6504960","6512900"," I don't know if I just have to get used to it or it's too big."
"6514080","6515060"," Yeah, yeah David. "
"6516600","6518760"," Is it 12 p.m. or one p.m. brother."
"6519120","6519680"," Couldn't remember."
"6522740","6524060"," It's twelve or one right. "
"6533620","6536780"," Another thing I want to show you to or maybe I won't show it to you but."
"6538400","6539040"," There's."
"6541020","6549480"," We should have twelve as of two days ago we should have twelve obsessions as of Friday as a Friday"
"6549480","6551660"," we should have twelve positive sessions. "
"6552200","6554600"," What did you guys think about over the weekend?"
"6554780","6555820"," What did you guys think about."
"6559160","6563560"," The invasion being held off due to weather that that was hilarious."
"6564740","6567980"," They were like the weather is bad we're going to we're going to pause the invasion. "
"6569860","6573080"," And that was funny because there was no bad weather."
"6574500","6575380"," And then."
"6576400","6581100"," And then also now Biden says he's heading to. "
"6582280","6584540"," Israel on Wednesday I think."
"6585700","6588820"," So I'm looking at that like oh yeah."
"6590580","6593080"," They're trying to slow this thing down a ton. "
"6593380","6595220"," And you know you think it's fascinating too is."
"6595960","6599500"," You get like when you call up your reserves you get that first two weeks."
"6600900","6605180"," And you're plugging holes and then you get another nine weeks of training up. "
"6606700","6609560"," I are our soldiers that need full training."
"6610520","6613900"," To get back into where they need to be."
"6613900","6617420"," So there's like that first hump of plugging the leaks and then the second hump. "
"6619660","6622200"," Of finding out that you're not at full readiness."
"6627300","6629500"," Jerry Barry saying the invasion begins Thursday."
"6630220","6632280"," Yeah with the with the claims release. "
"6633020","6634940"," Good job Barry's trying to figure this out too."
"6635040","6635620"," Good job Jimmy."
"6637540","6642920"," Good job brother like lining up the news releases with all this stuff right I agree with you Jimmy. "
"6647700","6650080"," They all just matches up right."
"6652120","6655600"," Go up there tag that 440 maybe tag 445."
"6656800","6658160"," And then boom roll it. "
"6675720","6677120"," Just doing butt stuff."
"6683220","6685580"," Yeah we let me go to the calendar really quick."
"6686700","6689920"," So I've got the actually have this morning I had the. "
"6691740","6697540"," This morning I have the the op X calendar up right in front of me right now we've got."
"6699120","6702460"," Options stop trading on the 20th this Friday."
"6703760","6709280"," And then the options expiry on the 21st so kind of a quiet op X but we do have to"
"6709280","6710320"," pay attention to it. "
"6710700","6713480"," Like what do they want where do they want price at by."
"6714080","6718480"," Monthly op X I'm betting it's that four four four zero right Jimmy."
"6719720","6725040"," There's a large large there's a large contingent of. "
"6725960","6729340"," Banks that want to see that forty four four zero don't they."
"6730120","6736500"," And possibly the forty five one zero two there's another large not note up there too."
"6741860","6746400"," Trade and hire fuck around Tuesday happening right now turn around Tuesday you guys like to call"
"6746400","6746520"," it. "
"6749400","6750000"," David."
"6750000","6753080"," If you're in the stream right now."
"6755700","6761200"," Do you want to talk about so David and I were having a great conversation on Friday. "
"6761960","6763300"," We were talking about."
"6765260","6766540"," How the market."
"6767340","6768840"," The algorithms work. "
"6770620","6772900"," And you guys always hear me on the show."
"6773920","6774940"," Talking about."
"6776460","6778420"," How you should be watching the clock. "
"6781560","6784320"," And that you should be watching the hours."
"6785100","6788080"," More specifically the half hour like nine thirty to ten thirty."
"6789660","6792420"," Ten thirty eleven thirty but the importance of. "
"6794340","6796860"," Time so if you're dealing with algorithms."
"6798720","6801700"," You know they're going to run on a clock right to some extent."
"6801700","6807700"," And you really use math right they're not just a human the human. "
"6809100","6811900"," They like numbers right they like numbers they like."
"6812440","6816620"," They like they like points of resistance and points of support."
"6817580","6819720"," And they love the clock so. "
"6820660","6821680"," That's like a second."
"6822620","6828080"," Part of the solution right is not just pay where they're going to seek out."
"6829700","6832340"," Liquidity right where they're going to get your stops and all that kind of stuff. "
"6832860","6836800"," On these pivot points but also that they use it they use time as well."
"6837940","6838460"," So."
"6839360","6845440"," You've got I was talking to David on Friday and he was talking about the Asian open and close the"
"6845440","6847440"," London open and close. "
"6848340","6850620"," And then the New York open and close."
"6851660","6853920"," And then of course the bond market."
"6856300","6860380"," And how the markets run on. "
"6861580","6864800"," Time that's the importance of time to the markets."
"6865240","6867660"," And your your awareness of time."
"6868180","6873280"," And the markets it was kind of cool because we're talking about what are Mondays what are Tuesdays"
"6873280","6878120"," what are Wednesdays what are Thursdays even breaking it down just a weekly basis. "
"6879660","6884060"," Now there's there's some caveats to that discussion that we discussed but."
"6885140","6887020"," Maybe we piece mail it David."
"6887700","6892960"," David you want to tell people about what Mondays Tuesdays Wednesdays Thursdays and Fridays are. "
"6893300","6897280"," Do you want to come on the show and talk about that like just a piece mail not the entire"
"6897280","6900720"," conversation but just just that one aspect of it."
"6901040","6903980"," Or do you want to talk about it in the in the chat on YouTube."
"6907480","6913280"," Yeah David's got forty four thirty eight seventy five Jimmy's got forty four hundred I've got forty"
"6913280","6918000"," four hundred forty four fifty and then I think it's forty five one three. "
"6919960","6921500"," From a gamma perspective."
"6925200","6930560"," Open a new bongas saying that we're approaching the New York pre market high from yesterday."
"6937260","6938800"," Was a post market maybe. "
"6944000","6945960"," I think we're on it right now right."
"6946700","6950380"," I'm speaking there not pre markets post market maybe you're saying."
"6959480","6960580"," Yeah post market. "
"6976520","6977620"," Yeah you want to do."

"6984480","6987220"," You want to just talk about days of the week."
"6990000","6992140"," Or do you want to come on a voice and video."
"6992840","6995180"," I could send you a link band and get you on if you want to just voice. "

"7041500","7045100"," Make sure you got your email address that I did but I'm not seeing it here."
"7047060","7048640"," Let me check signal."
"7056490","7059530"," You want to send me your email address via signal. "
"7061630","7067230"," I'll put John if you want to talk about what each day of the week is just basic like simple"
"7067230","7067890"," few minutes."

"7126450","7128390"," Yeah I was sick all week Karula."
"7129030","7136410"," I was fucking brutally sick man like I'm yesterday well then yesterday I was all fucked up like"
"7136410","7136980"," they gave me. "
"7138820","7141600"," Some happy pills nor happy for pain pills."
"7142940","7146080"," They didn't give me anything to take home though so I'm kind of upset about that."
"7156450","7156890"," Karula. "
"7165130","7168950"," I don't know what to chase say we're going to 280 I don't know that we are man."
"7168950","7171670"," I mean I think we can."
"7172550","7174970"," I got to be honest here. "
"7176570","7183450"," I'm sticking by that thing with the Middle East like it is and Jamie Dimon came out and said the"
"7183450","7184810"," same thing yesterday I think."
"7186850","7190370"," Very volatile very dangerous situation in the Middle East."
"7192070","7196330"," But I think all you can do is hedge it at least it's known. "
"7197530","7199670"," But the only thing you can do is definitely hedge it."
"7200170","7202750"," So I had a hedge on yesterday don't have a hedge on anymore."
"7204870","7208470"," I need to probably put a hedge on as we head into the end of the week too. "
"7209690","7215530"," In case that's the thing about the Middle East man it's it's like so many fucking unknowns."
"7216730","7219630"," Like when Ukraine and Russia popped off."
"7219630","7228070"," That really wasn't concerned about like terrorist attack or some sideways shit going off. "
"7229250","7233550"," But this you know like when you get into like the Middle East you never fucking know do you."
"7234110","7236550"," Squeeze an eye now trying to trade our one."
"7240130","7244250"," 436 is just traded a dollar 75 up here. "
"7248250","7250350"," They were 60 fucking cents earlier."
"7250350","7253670"," They were 30 cents down here than 60 cents."
"7253830","7255570"," They just traded a dollar 80 just now. "
"7271150","7276350"," Just a note that there are 206,000 calls on that 436 C."
"7277910","7280170"," That's where the majority of calls are."
"7280370","7284270"," There's still a little bit more down below to get picked up like 438 439 440."
"7286830","7291530"," But just note that the majority of zero dates are on that 436 C."
"7293330","7296470"," Those are those are fat as fuck right now. "
"7319440","7321100"," Those are my favorite films."
"7325540","7335150"," Yeah let's take a look at SPX right now."
"7341310","7343630"," Yeah getting that cross right now right. "
"7343950","7345830"," Oh yeah baby."
"7345830","7351190"," We don't have a lot of time left to this OPEX week Dewey."
"7352610","7355730"," We don't have a lot of time left here Dewey. "
"7362710","7366070"," Not a lot of time left here."
"7371100","7374080"," Got us selling off into earnings season."
"7375400","7376620"," Got great bank earnings. "
"7380780","7381920"," Analysts wrong again."
"7382320","7382780"," Stalker."
"7384080","7387520"," It's like a perfect set up man to buy into this earnings season isn't it?"
"7402550","7406270"," Jimmy's chime in saying just everybody's aware retail sales were up because of inflation. "
"7406690","7407970"," Not people spending more."
"7409830","7414850"," You know that's like retail sales reminds me of this Detroit thing."
"7419810","7422590"," You know it's like a part of you that wants to say to. "
"7423010","7426230"," It's like a part of you that or it's a part of me that wants."
"7428610","7432310"," The federal government to be able to come out and say stop price gouging right."
"7432550","7435050"," We're going to force you to stop price gouging on some stuff. "
"7436290","7439090"," Because you know that the part of retail sales is that right."
"7439370","7445150"," You get inflation coming down and then there's a there's a part of digging in the heels."
"7446190","7449810"," Of saying fuck you I'm not not lowering my prices right. "
"7458910","7460610"," There's your pivot right there."
"7461430","7468110"," Pullback on our one looking to see if the one minute or five minute gets bought down here."
"7468550","7470470"," If you haven't part taken it all yet. "
"7471130","7473490"," You'll be looking to buy that one minute trigger right here."
"7474270","7480130"," Or this pivot and to get this pullback here looking to buy that as well."
"7480810","7488010"," I saw yesterday you rejected early in the afternoon and you ended up going trading sideways. "
"7488890","7494630"," And down to the hourly trigger and then bounced back up traded it sideways."
"7495670","7499510"," I doubt you get the same repeat today as you did yesterday."
"7502530","7506010"," I'm assuming that's what you're all thinking that you're going to get a repeat of that from"
"7506010","7507150"," yesterday, but I doubt it. "
"7507770","7509170"," Did you guys see that yesterday?"
"7511550","7513970"," So yesterday was fucking beautiful."
"7515330","7521550"," Yesterday had this fucking awesome bounce off the show."
"7521550","7521750"," You. "
"7526250","7528410"," This is we find Monday here."
"7529610","7530990"," Right here."
"7532590","7533990"," So here's Monday. "
"7534670","7539090"," You have that beautiful squeeze up and then we came back down."
"7539630","7545670"," Bounce right on that hourly trigger right weekly trigger hourly trigger all down here."
"7548610","7552390"," Look at that gorgeousness down there just bought it like was nobody's business. "
"7556010","7558170"," There's that hourly trigger down here."
"7559750","7561430"," But I think we go higher."
"7561730","7563970"," I don't think we pull back like that today. "
"7564910","7566690"," Maybe we do but we'll find out."
"7569070","7572050"," I think we're going to I think we're going to we don't have a lot of time left in the"
"7572050","7572190"," week."
"7572190","7572790"," Today's Tuesday. "
"7573970","7578830"," So you figure the you figure these banks only have four days left."
"7581210","7583230"," So as time passes."
"7585750","7587530"," I'm going to expect here. "
"7588630","7590070"," I'm going to expect this to hold."
"7591630","7595350"," We know what your thoughts are in the chat if that's going to be like the chat."
"7595430","7597330"," Do you think that we have a repeat of yesterday?"
"7597990","7601410"," Pull back down to that hourly trigger and then we bounce from there. "
"7603070","7608270"," Like do you think we get something like this pull back down here."
"7608650","7611030"," And then we're off and running."
"7613330","7615630"," I don't know that we get that today. "
"7617350","7618610"," I think times running out."
"7618830","7623650"," I think times running out now it's possible we could do that we could like squeeze up into Friday"
"7623650","7626190"," on that four forty four but."
"7627210","7629490"," I'm betting that they go higher than that. "
"7629790","7634630"," They get that forty one then come back down into that four forty four zero for Friday."
"7637030","7638230"," You're saying down we go."
"7638370","7641010"," I think I think I think that's trapped for the book bears here. "
"7641310","7641950"," I'll be honest with you."
"7644550","7648770"," So tomorrow we've got an eight thirty then we've got housing starts then building permits."
"7649370","7652010"," We've got fed Governor Waller Chris Waller speaking at twelve. "
"7652010","7656350"," We also have John Williams speaking at twelve thirty at two PM on Wednesday."
"7656670","7657410"," We've got the beige book."
"7657830","7659030"," We've got Lisa Cook. "
"7659370","7661230"," So you got beige book at two."
"7662470","7664790"," You want to know beige books important for GDP."
"7665590","7669770"," We got a Waller speaking the building permits matter of fact we bring it up on. "
"7671290","7672770"," Why am I even doing this here?"
"7673470","7674750"," Let's do it."
"7675610","7676710"," Hold on here."
"7681810","7683070"," Let's go to trade the trigger. "
"7686880","7690120"," Trade the trigger has got its own economic calendar now doesn't it?"
"7697660","7699680"," Look at that later and Thursday."
"7700180","7702960"," That's the big one right you got claims at eight thirty in the morning."
"7703420","7707300"," You got a Philly Fed manufacturing survey at eight thirty two big ones. "
"7707920","7714200"," You got Jay Powell speaking at noon time on Thursday and then Friday you got master."
"7715220","7719740"," You got Boston speaking Logan bar speaking goose will be speaking."
"7720500","7723700"," All kinds of speakers lined up for Thursday. "
"7724540","7727160"," So you're going to assume that they already know this stuff right?"
"7728160","7729580"," They already know what's coming."
"7729580","7731960"," You got Biden speaking on Wednesday."
"7733440","7738000"," So I'm going to assume that whatever that Biden speech is going to coincide with all that crap as"
"7738000","7738240"," well. "
"7739180","7741580"," So they have a lot of time left between now and then do you?"
"7742720","7745280"," Between now and Thursday you got two sessions left."
"7749410","7750210"," All right."
"7750370","7753170"," So I got David AMS. Let me see what David says."
"7756570","7758030"," Give me one quick second here."

"7777570","7778010"," Vastvains."
"7783230","7788010"," Why is everybody speaking more than likely it has to do with. "
"7790470","7794490"," I'm more than likely it has to do with Biden on Wednesday, but it could be wrong."
"7796310","7797370"," We'll let us say it here."
"7952240","7953160"," All right, David. "

"7963760","7965100"," It may not work. "
"7965580","7967380"," It depends on the email address that you have."
"7967380","7970540"," If they allow you to come on stream or not."
"7970700","7973220"," So I might have to send you a Google meet link if it doesn't work. "
"7973460","7974280"," So we'll try it though."
"7974900","7975500"," See what happens."
"7982320","7984740"," Be very careful there of a squeeze to the upside. "
"7985080","7986760"," HYG finding its footing."
"7988180","7991620"," HYG wants to rip faces off and trade 72 74."
"7993440","7995600"," Apple with a major cross to the upside. "
"7996120","7998060"," Dixie getting sold down to the depths of hell."
"7998520","7999800"," Nasdaq looks very bullish."
"7999800","8001920"," Tesla very bullish here. "
"8002520","8006580"," Vicks looks like once they get sold to the depths of hell too."
"8006900","8008660"," So just be very careful if you are a bear."
"8010080","8016360"," 437 80 trading right now trying to squeeze up and trade that 439 16 currently. "
"8018520","8020560"," Should keep squeezing to the upside."
"8022960","8024700"," I did send you a link just then."
"8028320","8029320"," See if he's here. "
"8030140","8032060"," I don't see him here right now."
"8041380","8042500"," Wait until noon."
"8042840","8042900"," Yeah. "
"8049280","8050160"," Thanks Shaq."
"8050240","8050880"," I appreciate it brother."
"8057230","8058010"," Appreciate it brother. "
"8080850","8082690"," Do squeezes have time limits?"
"8082950","8084810"," Yeah, they do."
"8087690","8090250"," It's not I'm not concerned with the squeezing."
"8090850","8092150"," I don't like a lot of squeezing. "
"8092810","8096590"," Like any like big squeezes almost always come back."
"8097830","8103970"," And then the other thing about squeezing is I really prefer the break above and then the retest"
"8103970","8104390"," below."
"8105390","8107530"," Then the then the push higher from there. "
"8107710","8108470"," It's more sustainable."
"8118580","8120200"," I don't know if David's gotten."
"8123100","8125020"," So I did have your email address David. "
"8125540","8128820"," I forgot it was the rock the CAS bar email though."
"8145210","8148490"," Let me see if he's joining us right now."
"8148490","8151710"," Oh, there he is. "
"8151950","8153370"," Says he says, Hey, hey, right out brother."
"8153590","8154150"," I see you man."
"8154630","8155310"," How you doing man?"
"8156050","8156730"," Can you hear me?"
"8157950","8158670"," Hold on here. "
"8160010","8161310"," I can't hear you."
"8163850","8164370"," Hold on."
"8164450","8165790"," Let me give me a second here brother. "
"8165950","8168370"," Let me see if I can put my whole thing here."
"8168390","8169130"," I'm going to show you on stream."
"8169750","8170750"," Mind if I show your face. "
"8172510","8172670"," Okay."
"8175810","8178010"," Let me just turn the volume up here man."
"8180870","8181550"," That's weird. "
"8181690","8182250"," I'm not showing."
"8190520","8191620"," Hold on a second brother."
"8196010","8197150"," Cool app cam. "
"8197709","8198830"," Hold on here."
"8201690","8202809"," That's why hold on here."
"8203889","8204370"," Okay. "
"8209490","8210570"," Right on stream."
"8210850","8211670"," Show on stream."
"8217730","8218850"," Oh, yeah. "
"8220670","8222469"," I got you here with us right now."
"8222690","8223950"," Say something real quick."
"8230590","8232250"," Say something in the microphone. "
"8236320","8237299"," Hold on here."
"8240870","8242670"," I'm not getting volume here."
"8242809","8244450"," Hold on. "
"8250750","8251730"," Oh."
"8253530","8254629"," I just fucked up."
"8256490","8258170"," Oh, shoot. "
"8263389","8265110"," Shoot, shoot, shoot."
"8266250","8267270"," That wasn't good."
"8274090","8275250"," Shoot. "
"8278650","8279469"," Hold on."
"8286580","8287740"," Hang tight brother."
"8298889","8301830"," Yeah, I'm not getting any audio off you. "
"8301930","8302930"," I don't know why that is."
"8306299","8308280"," You just check properties on it."
"8309879","8311120"," Say something again. "
"8314730","8321049"," Check one to map CNBC."
"8322870","8324629"," That's saying everything is fine here."
"8326430","8333410"," I don't know why I'm not getting any audio off here right now. "
"8336209","8338129"," Let me see if I can send you somewhere else brother."
"8338350","8341389"," Hold on properties."
"8348620","8350360"," Check one to check one to. "
"8351100","8354740"," I don't know why that's I don't know why I'm not getting any volume."
"8355400","8356840"," Hey brother, I'm going to send you a different link."
"8356860","8357180"," Okay. "
"8360540","8361600"," Trash that one."
"8361840","8362580"," Trash that one."
"8375870","8377309"," Fucking streamlabs man. "
"8378150","8379230"," It's like the Catalina mixer."
"8404600","8411580"," David, if you're listening in right now, I just sent you a link to a different way to join us."
"8429410","8432070"," I'm going to have to figure out what the fuck is going on here. "
"8438770","8440710"," Yeah, we're going to bring David AMS on."
"8446350","8450630"," David, if you can hear me, I sent you a new link to Google Meets."
"8450890","8451790"," Join that meeting. "
"8453290","8455410"," And I'll get you on the show right now."
"8458920","8460400"," Check one, two."
"8477930","8480450"," David, you need to bring the mic up to my face or something. "
"8483370","8484210"," There we go."
"8484590","8484970"," Yeah."
"8485470","8485730"," All right. "
"8489280","8489880"," All right."
"8490080","8490400"," Say something."
"8491240","8491560"," Yeah. "
"8491780","8492220"," Can you hear me?"
"8492540","8492960"," Sweet."
"8493200","8493700"," I can hear you."
"8494020","8495040"," Everybody else can hear you. "
"8495040","8495100"," All right."
"8496200","8496980"," All right."
"8497280","8498220"," Thank me. "
"8500860","8502320"," You want a quick second here?"
"8504320","8504980"," All right."
"8505080","8505620"," There you are, brother."
"8506380","8506860"," Yeah. "
"8507700","8508320"," Hello, everyone."
"8509140","8516380"," Hey, so this is, so if you're, you don't, if you've never met David in person or be a video,"
"8516980","8524160"," or you've just heard of him, this is David AMS. Now he works with BookMap and he's a long time,"
"8524360","8531200"," or I don't know how long he's been trading, but at least five years, maybe, maybe longer, but I met"
"8531200","8531580"," David. "
"8532640","8534360"," Now he can talk about this in a minute."
"8534460","8541900"," I met David three or five years ago and we were in a trading group together, a private trading"
"8541900","8543080"," group and a private room."
"8544000","8548060"," I think it was 600 or a thousand bucks a month or something and saying what is all said and"
"8548060","8548200"," done. "
"8548200","8549720"," It was like a thousand bucks a month or something."
"8550520","8552340"," And David and I traded together, right?"
"8552720","8553540"," Yeah, he'd wait."
"8553780","8557980"," David traded the nighttime and I'd trade the morning to get together in the morning and discuss"
"8558420","8561460"," what he thought the nighttime was and I'd say what I expected during the day. "
"8563000","8566000"," And he would like, it was like a morning brief from David."
"8566720","8569340"," And then we'd check in with each other sometimes in a day as well."
"8569560","8574500"," I'd try to send him a DM and he'd send me DMS and in these trading rooms, if there was"
"8574500","8579060"," a pit, it was usually him and I and that pit trading together. "
"8580180","8583060"," And I said, no idea what they were doing."
"8583060","8584480"," I think it was weird."
"8586100","8588040"," And so that's how we got to know each other. "
"8588180","8595360"," And we fell apart and I didn't, I didn't become, I wasn't no longer a part of that trading group."
"8595360","8597940"," I ended up going on my own years a year later."
"8597940","8600480"," I was like, man, if he can overcome our way. "
"8601060","8605240"," So I reached out to my thinker, I forgot to, I couldn't find his name and then I finally found"
"8605240","8609200"," his name like a year or two later and I was like, we can get David with us with our"
"8609200","8609520"," group."
"8609580","8612120"," It's going to be fucking nothing but net positive."
"8612840","8616700"," And he reached back out to me and I was like, I got to get out my hands and knees"
"8616700","8619900"," and beg and plead to have some David in our lives. "
"8620080","8627840"," And he's been there for us every day since he spends his time in our discord in our futures"
"8627840","8633860"," channel, spends a lot of time with John L and those guys are trying to crack the market together."
"8634060","8634400"," It's wild."
"8634740","8636040"," And if you don't know, this guy is. "
"8636420","8643880"," This is David AMS, follow him on Twitter, follow him on discord and I'll let him take it away from"
"8643880","8644060"," here."
"8644260","8644860"," So go ahead, David."
"8645500","8647260"," You're not going to get much from me from Twitter. "
"8647520","8652340"," I'm actually sort of pretty quiet on social media front doing much with it."
"8652340","8661260"," But yeah, no, but we were together in the trading room with Bob Kendall when we started."
"8662000","8669260"," And yeah, I think we left at the same time and then sort of went on our own journeys to"
"8669260","8674300"," figure out, you know, because like I started trading during COVID or right before COVID. "
"8675620","8680700"," And yeah, we were trying to figure out how the markets worked and those kinds of things."
"8680700","8687780"," And then in the end, my journey was quite long and I used to work a lot with book map."
"8688720","8692040"," But yeah, now I don't use any of that anymore, actually. "
"8692560","8699600"," So because it's all distractions, really, for me, it's it's creating biases while you shouldn't,"
"8699620","8704140"," you know, trade based on where you see a red band on the liquidity."
"8704140","8711640"," And then about a year and a half ago, I stumbled across ICT as trading system and I had my"
"8711640","8715620"," own system in place and I was profitable, but I wanted to optimize it."
"8715720","8720520"," So I was always looking to see how, you know, to get things done properly. "
"8721200","8721600"," Sorry."
"8721780","8723460"," I'm being distracted by this pussy here."
"8723560","8729120"," She's like nagging me for food, so she's joining the stream. "
"8730960","8737060"," Yeah, so I started to work with that system about a year ago and that was like the big game"
"8737060","8742460"," changer for me in that sense, where I started to look at the market that a completely different"
"8742460","8742840"," way."
"8743840","8747320"," And yeah, not going back, you know, doing it a hundred percent."
"8747580","8753300"," So now like I just wait for specific setups to unfold at specific times of day. "
"8753300","8759680"," And then if it shows up, it shows up and if it doesn't, I stay out."
"8760180","8767400"," So, and in the meantime, I tend to scalp when I know it's heading towards a certain direction or"
"8767400","8774880"," when I expect a specific reversal to occur at a specific time, I will take the other side of of"
"8774880","8780340"," whatever is happening because the market is actually not really moving on, like buying and selling,"
"8780860","8787160"," you know, in my opinion, it's moving based on where liquidity is located at such as stops."
"8787700","8795360"," So there are basically three things I keep an eye on and those are recent swing highs and lows and"
"8795360","8804780"," the midpoint and the midnight open for New York time is a very important area for me to work from. "
"8806340","8811500"," And yeah, these setups, like you just said, you know, I'm waiting for a specific setup to develop"
"8811500","8819340"," between like 12 o'clock New York time and about 130, but it only happens in certain market"
"8819340","8819740"," conditions."
"8820100","8823620"," And like today is not a good one to do it because we are obviously trending."
"8824380","8830680"," And when I see these big hourly candles like going that big, you know, I stay out, I'm not going"
"8830680","8832820"," to pick a clock or a bottom in that case. "
"8833620","8840140"," However, like in situations where you have like a sell off going off and like, for example, if we"
"8840140","8849420"," reach that specific low or that I have marked up previously at noon, I will mean reverted back"
"8849420","8853140"," because it doesn't really matter what state the market is in."
"8853540","8860900"," For some reason at that time, there's always a drawn liquidity back to where stops are located at."
"8861660","8869560"," And even if it's going to continue down trending in a specific direction, they will take out those"
"8869560","8876640"," stops first before they continue to move the market down on an exceptional basis or like it"
"8876640","8880920"," doesn't, maybe it happens once a month or something like that, it will continue without like"
"8880920","8882000"," adhering to the rules. "
"8882360","8887480"," But the setup does show up like three or four times a week, at least."
"8888620","8892200"," And that's all you need because like you get 10 points, 15 points."
"8892740","8898740"," And if you manage to, you know, to position yourself in the right options, you can get big gains. "
"8899140","8903860"," And a lot of times you will get like the high or low of the day to be made at"
"8903860","8904300"," that point."
"8905580","8913540"," And yeah, and like where I make my most of my money is really in the London open because there's"
"8913540","8915260"," a specific setup that always happens."
"8915820","8924880"," There's a range that is set during the Asian session and in London, they will always go back to"
"8924880","8928960"," either the Asian high or the Asian low and then go back to the mid, yeah. "
"8929660","8935660"," So and I don't care if it goes further or if I'm in it or not, you know, I'm quite"
"8935660","8937460"," nimble in what I get."
"8937460","8938820"," I can get more out of it."
"8939280","8946260"," And, you know, that's a process that will take years even because it's not, I'm a bad person to be"
"8946260","8949340"," able to hold my runners for like a move like this. "
"8949580","8953440"," Like this level here where we bounced, I had this marked out on Monday already."
"8954680","8960100"," And you know, but like the reason why I stayed out and I actually shut down the computer and I"
"8960100","8964300"," left the house because I had some nice weather here and I thought, you know, I went to the gym"
"8964300","8969540"," and I, you know, it was pretty nice outside and then I thought to myself, well, first of all, there"
"8969540","8975520"," are a few things that are red flags for me because the problem was is that dollar and yes, we're"
"8975520","8982580"," dropping at the same time this morning, which is something I do not like because I usually like"
"8982580","8983940"," trading in burst."
"8984460","8990100"," So if dollar goes down and the market goes up, that's like something for me to keep an eye on. "
"8990460","8991480"," And I like doing that."
"8991680","8992940"," And that wasn't the case this morning."
"8994000","8999260"," So even though I had like, we spoke about it on Friday, what the bias was, because we, I think"
"8999260","9004880"," we both opened up the calls on Friday afternoon or after the close, you know, where we said, hey,"
"9005080","9012320"," listen, you know, something's up because like we were watching NASDAQ and I even posted it in a"
"9012320","9018420"," discord, I said, you know, guys, watch this level because that 15105 is something's happening. "
"9018420","9018920"," Yeah."
"9019120","9025520"," So those SPX calls, they're buying all those NQ calls for yesterday or for yesterday."
"9025660","9025780"," Yeah. "
"9026620","9027260"," Yeah."
"9027520","9029420"," And I don't use book map anymore."
"9029660","9035480"," So sometimes I log into YouTube and then, and I don't really care what happens like during the"
"9035480","9036100"," session itself. "
"9036100","9042740"," But I like to watch it the last 30 minutes because especially when, when they're dropping things"
"9042740","9049760"," down and you see ice buying, I know from my experience in the past that that will last for at"
"9049760","9056920"," least a few days after, you know, even though they can drop it below it, in my mind, they are"
"9056920","9059020"," actually accumulating in that area."
"9059380","9064420"," And it doesn't mean that that's going to be the low that day or anything because they explain that"
"9064420","9072480"," accumulate part two because I don't know if everybody here understands like taking the emphasis off"
"9072480","9076940"," bearish and bullish and more that it's accumulating at these rock bottom prices and then"
"9076940","9077360"," distributing."
"9077360","9082060"," Well, you know, it doesn't really matter where price is, you know, it's the game that they're"
"9082060","9082360"," playing. "
"9082780","9085320"," It's like it's divided into four quarters."
"9085740","9091120"," So you have an accumulation phase is the first phase, which is usually on a Monday."
"9091660","9094480"," And then on Tuesday, you have this manipulation phase. "
"9095920","9098220"," And on Wednesday, you have the distribution."
"9099140","9104980"," And then on Thursday, you either have a continuation or reversal or whatever they were doing."
"9107080","9111300"," So Monday is always like a laid back day for me in that sense. "
"9111640","9117100"," And like yesterday, everyone was complaining that the market was like shit, but like for me, it's"
"9117100","9121680"," my bread and butter because it's it's stable, you know, so it's predictable for me."
"9121800","9122660"," Let's say that one more time."
"9122660","9125040"," So Monday is simulation day. "
"9126140","9128460"," Yeah, Tuesday's manipulation day."
"9129040","9129540"," Yeah."
"9129540","9134740"," Oftentimes retailers will call that turn around Tuesday, right?"
"9135420","9135900"," Correct. "
"9136260","9136340"," Yeah."
"9137060","9142320"," And of course, it doesn't work out every time, but no, no, no, but it's a perfect example how it"
"9142320","9149140"," was, you know, it's like, it's, it's, I guess you could call it the Judas wing in a sense, because"
"9149140","9153800"," like the point is that they're dropping it down, trapping everyone in and to shorts at the lower"
"9153800","9157740"," end and then they, you know, rip your face off your face, yeah."
"9158480","9166680"," So, um, and like I, I have my, like, I thought something like that was going to happen, but like,"
"9166680","9170960"," you know, yesterday I had a really good day and I said to myself, you know, okay, you know, there's"
"9170960","9176360"," no need to meet beach, you know, trading this crap, I'll just wait for a set up to unfold that"
"9176360","9182540"," I recognize because dollar was acting up a little bit that I didn't like, even though I was bearish"
"9182540","9188040"," on it, saying it was going to go lower from now on, you know, and everyone was so bullish on"
"9188040","9190900"," it and I said, no, well, I don't, I just don't see it. "
"9191660","9194620"," And they were whipsawing it both ways."
"9195180","9200600"," And so, you know, I, I traded six, I six E is like the Euro version of the XY."
"9201960","9210480"," So I traded that this morning, mostly, and I took some calls on, on SPX, but there were a few"
"9210480","9215020"," warning signs for me where that I didn't like because like the bid ask was really wide. "
"9215780","9222920"," And I was getting really bad fills, even though I was, you know, picking bottoms and tops, in that"
"9222920","9228140"," sense, with my entries, which was good, but that gives me the room to be able to, you know, to"
"9228140","9235800"," handle that, but like, taking the profit off of it is really tough because, let's say the premiums,"
"9236260","9244220"," for example, on SPX, you would think they would run it up to, let's say, you got in at 17"
"9244220","9249100"," or something like that, and they run it up to 23 or 24 dollars."
"9250160","9252060"," You don't get filled at that price."
"9252500","9259700"," So you, you know, I pull the plug like a dollar or two before that, because, you know, I rather"
"9259700","9268280"," secure the profit than trying to like, get out at the extreme high, for example, you know, and what"
"9268280","9274580"," the setups are that I basically start to look for is, is like the way I'm saying it, how it's"
"9274580","9277180"," divided into quarters in a week. "
"9277700","9280320"," It's also like that's actually during the day."
"9280660","9289060"," So those, those accumulation, manipulation, distribution, and those reversal phases, they also"
"9289060","9290960"," occur during the day itself."
"9292140","9302300"," And so it's when he came up with this theory, because"
"9302300","9310680"," based on the gill zones that ICT teaches us to trade, for example, he was sort of like trying to"
"9310680","9313100"," figure out and fine tune them a little bit more. "
"9313360","9318720"," So it's like this, it's like looking at the February low and then the April lows, the accumulation,"
"9319200","9325040"," the manipulation, then, yeah, distribution phases are even on the higher timeframes over the course"
"9325040","9331360"," of a year, you can apply them to the month or to the quarter to the day, yeah, because like"
"9331360","9336640"," with the, yeah, yeah, because like the month really, you know, everyone thinks the first of the"
"9336640","9341960"," month is when the month opens, but it actually doesn't, you know, it isn't."
"9342100","9350480"," And then the week doesn't open until on a Tuesday, which is a bit weird, because, you know, you"
"9350480","9355960"," would see them use that level to accumulate either above or below."
"9355960","9364220"," So like for today, like, like, and on NASDAQ, you know, the through week open for this week, we're"
"9364220","9365420"," actually on it right now. "
"9366400","9374460"," And because that that is where, let's say this week starts, but you know, what did they do?"
"9374740","9379920"," They dropped it down and they started accumulating below it, and now they're back at it, you know,"
"9380240","9380500"," so."
"9381940","9385460"," And for the month, they actually were above it."
"9385460","9392300"," So it's really tough because like everyone's being so bearish on the market while I look at"
"9392300","9396760"," seasonalities and, you know, and can they be wrong?"
"9396980","9397480"," Yeah, of course. "
"9397900","9406280"," But even though it can be wrong, they will still follow it in a sense, you know, I've noticed."
"9407260","9412140"," So I try to stick my guns and keep to that plan, at least."
"9412740","9419400"," And I noticed like on Monday, because like, you remember on Friday, we discussed that we were going"
"9419400","9420640"," to keep those calls out, right?"
"9421060","9423220"," And I said, I'm going to hold them. "
"9423480","9424280"," Well, guess what?"
"9424460","9427860"," On Monday, I woke up and I was in profit."
"9428280","9431940"," And I think I got like five bucks out of it or something like that in premiums."
"9433100","9434140"," And I sold them. "
"9434940","9440980"," And the reason why I did that was because I was opening up Twitter again and then, you know, seeing"
"9440980","9448720"," what videos people were posting and their biases of these people that I, you know, look highly up"
"9448720","9448960"," to."
"9449740","9453860"," And even my mentor, you know, he said, you know, stay out of the markets."
"9454460","9455200"," It's a mess. "
"9455660","9459140"," And so I chickened out and I sold them."
"9459480","9464440"," While those premiums, I bought them for eight bucks on Friday and they ran them up yesterday to 60,"
"9464440","9467120"," you know, yeah, they ran up."
"9467880","9468820"," Yeah, yeah. "
"9469340","9473680"," So and that's why I'm saying, you know, my weakness still is holding my runners and sticking to my"
"9473680","9478300"," plan and not letting outside factors influence me."
"9480240","9485160"," Because like, that's where I have my stop for, you know, anyway, you know, I'm having a hard time"
"9485160","9494660"," right now with finding a balance in what I consume from Twitter,"
"9494660","9502560"," Fentuet and CNBC and Bloomberg and much struggling per se, but you kind of need to be aware of"
"9502560","9503420"," everything going on."
"9503660","9510380"," But you don't, I don't want to get influenced by the the churn, but I mean, like, you know, it's"
"9510380","9510640"," sold. "
"9511300","9511700"," Yeah."
"9511820","9516160"," But like the low was was when the worst started, you know, it's like, and for me, it's really"
"9516160","9522220"," difficult because my trading partner that I like, you know, do everything with, like next to"
"9522220","9527700"," helping everyone out in the discord, I have a trading partner that lives in Israel, actually in the"
"9527700","9527960"," north."
"9529100","9537100"," And it was really difficult for me to, um, longest markets, like knowing what he's going through,"
"9537100","9541620"," you know, all the help and and and the crap that is going on there. "
"9542400","9546660"," And I had to really turn off a switch in my head to be able to do that."
"9546800","9550820"," And it took like three or four days for me to be able to do that before I was able"
"9550820","9553100"," to, you know, join the party in that sense."
"9554100","9554500"," Yeah. "
"9556320","9562840"," This, um, the all consumingness of it or the news or the threats or all you can do is hedge"
"9562840","9564080"," it right and then go long."
"9564700","9566520"," Someone posted that over the weekend."
"9567420","9570400"," I reposted it on Twitter over the weekend. "
"9570500","9575540"," And what I reposted, it says, um, uh, podcast."
"9575960","9577060"," He's here in the stream right now."
"9577100","9578440"," He's the guy that posted this. "
"9578520","9585500"," He posted a meme, uh, on the 13th that said, uh, when stocks drops sharply due to the threat of"
"9585500","9589800"," nuclear war by the dip, if nuclear war doesn't happen, you'll profit."
"9590300","9592340"," If it does, you won't need the money, right?"
"9592540","9594240"," There's an aspect of truth to this, right?"
"9595540","9604700"," Um, and then that statement that pod or that meme that podcast, uh, made comes from, uh, there's"
"9604700","9609380"," written about and all kinds of book, the hedge fund market wizards books that whole, not, we're not"
"9609380","9614740"," just that book, but the whole market wizard book series time and again, these traders talk about"
"9614740","9615020"," that."
"9616200","9619520"," Yeah, it's, it's, you know, and it's, it's a psychological part. "
"9619720","9622840"," So, um, no one talks about it."
"9622920","9630140"," Yeah, you do on stream, you know, but, but that's something that I never, um, got in the beginning"
"9630140","9635440"," when I started trading, you know, it was always this trouble in trying because like my bias was"
"9635440","9637360"," always clapping my judgment in that sense."
"9637660","9642420"," While I was pretty good in, in, in saying, Hey, we're going to go up or down, but, you know,"
"9642620","9648460"," executing it the way you think it will and managing it is something different that will take time"
"9648460","9649780"," to be able to do that. "
"9650480","9651500"," And that took me years."
"9652160","9662330"," You know, it's, it's weird too because, uh, I always hear people publicly saying, I always"
"9662330","9667910"," see people saying, um, like I'm in control."
"9668150","9675470"," It's like, it's like the stock market macho thing to say is, uh, I have no emotions when I trade"
"9675470","9678650"," and I never argue with my own mind. "
"9679510","9686090"," And, uh, my other favorite one, I think that small group of, of statements is I can trade this"
"9686090","9687270"," market up or down."
"9687270","9688430"," I don't care, right?"
"9688890","9690870"," And it's not that you can't trade the market up or down."
"9690870","9697570"," It's not that you can't be emotionless, uh, or keep your, your, your head out of your trading. "
"9698430","9703930"," Uh, I always say, uh, the dumber you are, like, I think I've become a better investor and trader."
"9704950","9707470"," The more I get, you don't dumb it down."
"9707710","9712010"," It's like, it's not quite dumbing it down, but overthinking it, right?"
"9712210","9715310"," Or, or I've got my tools and my tools to tell me to do this. "
"9715890","9716890"," And then I'm overthinking."
"9717370","9721890"," And that's the overcomplicating part is usually the emotions or the mind overthinking a position."
"9723090","9726850"," Um, but it's there. "
"9727130","9727410"," It's there."
"9728050","9728050"," Yeah."
"9728590","9731570"," Even if people don't want to admit it, it's usually there for most people. "
"9732190","9733430"," Do you think that or no?"
"9734130","9736250"," Or it seems like you're describing it to some extent."
"9737250","9742790"," Yeah, it is because I still have it sometimes, you know, it's like sometimes I think to myself, oh,"
"9743190","9748930"," fuck man, you know, you see these people sometimes, well, if it's true or not, I don't know, I'll"
"9748930","9754010"," leave that in the middle, but you know, where they're just like emotionless going into it."
"9754270","9760770"," And I am a lot in a lot of, in a lot of ways, but only when it's, um, doing"
"9760770","9766810"," exactly, but like a lot of times I noticed what, where I'm running into is where I think something"
"9766810","9767350"," will happen. "
"9767870","9774510"," And then I'm dumbfounded and I'm actually surprised it's actually doing it that I got it right"
"9774510","9779110"," where I'm like, I don't trust myself yet, you know, to get into this position."
"9779730","9785070"," And I can maximize and look, I have nothing to complain, you know, I doubled my portfolio."
"9785410","9792610"," I think even more for this year, but it's, it's just, it's still a struggle that I have even to"
"9792610","9802520"," this day, you know, it's like, to be honest, I don't try to pay attention anymore to, um, to what"
"9802520","9805760"," is going on outside out of my art world. "
"9806080","9808120"," How do you get your, uh, how do you get your news?"
"9811860","9815160"," Um, I don't really, I don't watch news that much."
"9815580","9821840"," Do you follow like an economic calendar or you're basically using the clock for reports?"
"9822420","9826220"," Well, I listen to the news when, when you put it on and some, you know, I have to stream"
"9826220","9827680"," on on the background a lot of times."
"9828040","9833420"," So I get that news quack and I do watch to see if there are, um, let's say economic releases,"
"9833420","9838400"," but I, I just have this window and interactive brokers that comes up and that just shows me"
"9838400","9842080"," everything and I'll just double check that with financial juice also. "
"9843080","9849200"," But like in the past, I would keep track of what the economic releases were, like even the numbers."
"9849740","9853540"," And now I don't give the fuck anymore, you know, it doesn't matter because it's all cooked."
"9853940","9856320"," Anyway, you know, it's like, it doesn't matter. "
"9856480","9857580"," Good news is bad news."
"9857800","9861160"," The other, the next day, bad news, good news, it doesn't matter."
"9861780","9865140"," You know, you know what does matter is where, where does the price bounce?"
"9865680","9870980"," Like today was a perfect example, you know, you know, I had these two lines marked, which is, which"
"9870980","9876140"," are, it's called a fair failure gap that was on the daily chart, you know, because we have made a"
"9876140","9881500"," loan ready where I was like, ah, fuck, okay, this could be one of those three point lows, you know,"
"9881620","9887700"," we have the first gap from four a.m. or no, is what we were you wondering if they would"
"9887700","9889320"," close the four a.m. gap or no?"
"9890600","9900020"," You mean to go up first and then yeah, no, because what was happening in London, um, that just like"
"9900020","9904200"," the setup that is in London is, is it doesn't go up like that. "
"9904980","9911240"," So, um, that's the trap that they put in because if you look at three a.m. they make the"
"9911240","9914540"," high, um, on yes."
"9915520","9920400"," And, and that is like, you know, they, they like trap the London traders in, in that sense."
"9920620","9920660"," Yeah. "
"9921280","9926100"," Well, it doesn't matter who they are, but you know, what they do is they breach the Asian high and"
"9926100","9931660"," then you think things that are going to go up further because like, we have levels above there that"
"9931660","9934260"," we could go test like, like the high of yesterday."
"9935500","9938120"," And I see them reversing it a lot of times."
"9938520","9944120"," And then like, usually when I put the trade on, I get out by five, you know, like five a "
"9944120","9944740",".m. your time. "
"9946020","9950740"," And even though it keeps running, and like in this case, we had this economic release happening."
"9951560","9956080"," And I didn't see it, but I didn't see like it dropped like that until I was outside."
"9956080","9957780"," And then I'll roll the background. "
"9958100","9960000"," If you're watching the stream right now, sorry, David, interrupt."
"9960520","9961440"," Yeah, I don't know where it was."
"9961440","9967000"," Watch this role here to the downside, target to the downside, 430, 643 possibly. "
"9967300","9968300"," No confirmation yet."
"9968480","9969680"," No rejection to head down there."
"9970680","9971600"," Just keep an eye on that. "
"9971700","9973620"," You see that rug pull on book map right now."
"9974020","9975100"," Yeah, David, sorry to interrupt brother."
"9975520","9976320"," Yeah, no worries. "
"9977440","9979140"," And watch the previous day."
"9979140","9982520"," It needs to hold that 44 through 14 to five."
"9982760","9983360"," I think. "
"9987250","9995650"," And yeah, so and when they drop those economic releases, then like, I stay out on the first 30"
"9995650","9997590"," minutes and let them do whatever they want to do."
"9998170","10005970"," And then I think you're talking about how when they're finding those highs and lows, they keep"
"10005970","10011390"," coming back to those highs and lows, their importance of those highs and lows."
"10012010","10015730"," But yeah, because that's where stops are, you know, it's simple. "
"10015910","10017030"," The market just moves on stops."
"10017710","10019230"," It's like, where are the stops left?"
"10019550","10020610"," That's the first thing I look at."
"10021390","10027210"," And even now, you know, like to go back up, first we need to take out the stops. "
"10028810","10030710"," So we need people to puke."
"10031310","10035330"," And even though, you know, when it's when it's trending up, and when the algorithms are turned on"
"10035330","10040670"," to go to a certain direction, it is because they want to reach to a certain place to."
"10041430","10041830"," Yeah. "
"10042270","10043510"," You can see today, right?"
"10043670","10048990"," You can see them just like, yeah, I'm watching it saying, I'm like, we all know they're like, I"
"10048990","10051790"," said, I didn't want to say it in stream, but I was I wanted what I wanted to say in"
"10051790","10054990"," stream was we all and Jimmy Barry's am harping on that."
"10055310","10057650"," Few guys have been harping this past couple of weeks."
"10058310","10062170"," It's like, you know, the fucking market wants to trade that four, four, four, zero. "
"10062870","10064570"," Yeah, time is burning."
"10064590","10066990"," So you know, they're going to wait until the last minute to do it."
"10067090","10069370"," They're probably going to go above it and then bring it back down and park it. "
"10070450","10074190"," Bring it above and then park it into their opx at four p.m. on Friday."
"10075330","10083050"," And, you know, and I see it also in the premium pricing, you know, so like, because I chart those"
"10083050","10086450"," premiums, I mean, you see them running it down."
"10086710","10091490"," And then like, like, today, let me have today's premiums are we're out of control this morning. "
"10091630","10092070"," They're out of control."
"10092210","10093410"," It's more in the control right now."
"10094210","10095550"," I mean, I already pulled it in. "
"10096410","10102130"," Yeah, I was playing 43.70 calls for two days out like I was playing today's and and and tomorrow's"
"10102130","10107990"," because I, you know, if I if I leave the computer and I want to, you know, buy myself some"
"10107990","10116930"," time in that sense with with theta, like, those 43.70s this morning, when I was trading them, you"
"10116930","10121710"," know, I was I was getting in at 16 bucks, you know, and getting out at 21, you know, there"
"10121710","10122730"," was not much going on."
"10122730","10130650"," And I did not go short or anything because like, I don't know, it's things weren't adding up"
"10130650","10137890"," because I saw the discrepancy with dollar going on and euro going up and the market was going like"
"10137890","10142850"," tripping down and I and then I just, you know, take my hands off."
"10143470","10147490"," But they dropped those premiums all the way down to $7 right now. "
"10148510","10153490"," So at 10 a.m. this morning, they were trading seven and now, you know, they ran them up to"
"10153490","10153730"," 32."
"10154930","10157790"," I mean, you know, that's a 320% gain."
"10158470","10158970"," Just there. "
"10159330","10160850"," We were all the only thing you have to do."
"10162430","10164810"," Yeah, girls, we were also talking about."
"10165250","10170050"," So you're talking about the rise and fall of the premium on an option right on SPX. "
"10170930","10175170"," You also chart those out, don't you, on IBCARE or."
"10175830","10176510"," Yeah."
"10177070","10184830"," So what I do is I, every morning, wherever it doesn't matter where SPX has closed. "
"10185470","10190710"," So yesterday, I think they closed at 68 or something like that or 73."
"10192070","10198290"," So I just play the calls and the that are where SPX closed on yesterday."
"10199550","10199950"," That's it. "
"10201630","10204730"," And I said alerts on both of them at 10 bucks."
"10205630","10207870"," And I just wait for one of them to break out or break down."
"10208670","10211650"," And then I just snatched them up for for discount. "
"10212810","10216770"," So basically, like 90% of my trades are always long."
"10217150","10219470"," Even going short, I long puts."
"10220430","10221610"," You get what I'm at?"
"10221850","10222450"," So that's right. "
"10223510","10223990"," Yeah."
"10225210","10230570"," Yeah, I don't trade by, you know, we have this conversation because I just the problem, I can't"
"10230570","10231850"," trade that during London."
"10232590","10236950"," And the FV issues too, don't you?"
"10238210","10239050"," Not really. "
"10239270","10243430"," I mean, it doesn't matter those fees, you know, like people are always talking about commissions"
"10243430","10246110"," and I just see that I see that as cost of production."
"10246110","10255990"," You know, I don't even care what I pay on commission because it's just, I don't know, it may"
"10255990","10260650"," sound a little cocky, but it's just like part of the game, I guess, you know."
"10263170","10268930"," There's not much I can do about it and like those few dollars I can save on it, you know,"
"10268930","10270010"," it's all right. "
"10270270","10276930"," But the thing is, is with spy, I can only trade them in options because I'm based in Europe."
"10277290","10285890"," So for example, like buying outright 100 shares spy, I'm unable to do that unless I sell a put and"
"10285890","10288550"," get assigned or exercise it or something like that."
"10290750","10293850"," And then the only thing I can do with them is sell them again. "
"10295330","10300270"," So, and SPX is just, you know, it's trading 23 hours a day."
"10300590","10302410"," So, yeah, it's one of the nice parts."
"10302710","10304590"," It's like the X now trades 23 a day. "
"10304690","10305310"," It's awesome sauce."
"10306490","10313410"," Yeah, and but the thing is, is that you do have to take into account is the bid ask."
"10314450","10315370"," There's a big spread. "
"10315550","10323090"," Sometimes the spread can be even like 70 cents, you know, and that's a lot because like if we have"
"10323090","10328210"," a narrow range and they have such a big spread, sometimes you don't get a proper exit."
"10328430","10334910"," Even though your direction is right, you need to be careful and time your entries and your exits"
"10334910","10335390"," properly."
"10336510","10344010"," And that's why I just wait for these extremes to get hit first to take the opposite side of the"
"10344010","10344210"," trade. "
"10344490","10348110"," You made that comment on Friday, too, didn't you trade the extremes, right?"
"10348910","10349890"," Yeah, like center."
"10350090","10353190"," That's what even without ex going into too much explanation."
"10353210","10355430"," I mean, Friday, we went, we went down the rabbit hole. "
"10358350","10368710"," But when I took away from one of the things that took away, you had some easy simplifications of"
"10368710","10369530"," how to trade."
"10369690","10376130"," And I loved what you had to say, you said, trade the extremes, look back in time and look for"
"10376130","10384390"," those extremes where we continue wherever we return to frequently then look for those extremes as a"
"10384390","10386470"," place to long or short the market."
"10387490","10393050"," Yeah, because it's quite simple because like for me, there are a few time windows where I keep an"
"10393050","10398730"," eye on like in the morning, it's like at five a.m. And the other one is at three twenty. "
"10399490","10400510"," Let's go start."
"10400530","10401370"," Oh, let's start this."
"10401930","10406270"," So if you're watching the show right now, get your pens and papers and your notepads out. "
"10406590","10412710"," So you just got David spoke to you about what each day is like, not every day, but there is"
"10412710","10415450"," a flow to what each day is about, right?"
"10416030","10420550"," And now David's talking about extremity is going to give you some important times of the day."
"10421230","10422950"," So go ahead, David, start interrupt."
"10423790","10429010"," It's quite simple because like, you know, the only thing is opposed, I posted in the discord"
"10429010","10432590"," because like you have the day is divided into four quarters. "
"10432610","10438330"," You have the accumulation, manipulation, distribution, and then expansion or continuation or"
"10438330","10439470"," reversal, for example."
"10440150","10442370"," And they always happen in a specific order."
"10442370","10444370"," So it's always like that. "
"10444890","10451910"," Or the other one is is that it expands in Q1 and then accumulation is happening in Q2 and then"
"10451910","10452970"," make you three, it's manipulation."
"10455930","10462610"," So you have this timetable, for example, that I posted into the discord where you can see what I"
"10462610","10463590"," mean with it."
"10464270","10465930"," And you're going to post it right now at this court?"
"10467170","10468190"," Yeah, I could do that. "
"10468370","10469850"," You want to post it in the general chat?"
"10470630","10475670"," Yeah, or you know what, you know, don't post in the general chat, post in the futures room, man."
"10476390","10478750"," Let them go to the futures room and find it there."
"10480110","10482850"," Yeah, because like it's quite simple. "
"10483170","10488710"," Like the first space always dictates, like let's say the second, the third and the fourth phase,"
"10488710","10489010"," right?"
"10489890","10494490"," And if the first phase is consolidation, then the second one will expand and the third will"
"10494490","10496610"," consolidate and the fourth will expand again."
"10497350","10502770"," So if the first phase expands, then the second will consolidate and the third will expand and the"
"10502770","10503450"," fourth will consolidate."
"10504850","10507590"," And it comes down to what I was telling you, you know. "
"10507710","10514630"," So if Asia consolidates, then I trade London and then I skip New York and then I trade the PM"
"10514630","10515310"," session again."
"10516110","10522590"," Like if Asia is expanding, I skip London and then I trade New York in the AM and I do"
"10522590","10524090"," anything in the PM session."
"10524950","10531070"," So it's like every morning I wake up, I look and see what Asia does and then I plan my"
"10531070","10534290"," day, you know, and then I decide for myself what I'm going to do. "
"10534590","10538250"," So your first part of the day is finding out what is Asia doing, right?"
"10538730","10543910"," Yeah, yeah, because if they're expanding, then I got the morning off, you know, I just I don't even"
"10543910","10548150"," touch it anymore because then London dropped around unless it's if there's like a lot of rain"
"10548150","10553870"," happening, you know, which is rare in that sense when when Asia has already expanded."
"10555350","10561910"," But there are like some key times where I do like to keep an eye on it because like at"
"10561910","10568350"," six AM, something turns on also, you know, so I, you know, I also know that at that point, like"
"10568350","10578030"," I know what it does at your, let's see 12 PM New York time, which is like my new, it's"
"10578030","10579270"," the same behavior that occurs."
"10579610","10585610"," It's like these algorithms turn on and then, you know, they mean reverted. "
"10586610","10594890"," Yeah, and the cycle just repeats every single day, you know, you don't even need to have anything"
"10594890","10599110"," on your chart, you know, just mark out the high and the low and then they will seek it on"
"10599110","10602190"," whatever 90 minutes, you know, it's been doing."
"10602790","10608650"," So how many of you out there watching the highs and lows of the Asian session, the opening of the"
"10608650","10615150"," London session and then marking the highs or assuming where we are in the US session, the New York"
"10615150","10622790"," session in the morning, is everybody out there tracking those sessions or no, find out from in the"
"10622790","10626330"," chat, anybody in the chat, do you do that or not?"
"10632750","10635330"," Yeah, some of you guys, old gamer guys saying he does now."
"10638200","10643620"," Because it was an eye opener for me because like I was missing this element in, in understanding"
"10643620","10652220"," when, when things would turn and like I always saw this thing happening at like, because it's 6 p "
"10652220","10654360",".m. for me, which is your noon, right?"
"10654940","10659120"," So you're going to bring up these, open one of these charts and show people this or do you want"
"10659120","10660740"," to share a chart on the screen, you can. "
"10662060","10662500"," Sure."
"10662980","10672380"," So if you look on the, Dave, if you look on the bottom of your Google Meet, it says, it"
"10672380","10679040"," should say, present now, present now, it's a little arrow in a box in the center."
"10679100","10683660"," If you're looking in the bottom center of your Google Meet, it should have a little arrow in box. "
"10684200","10687500"," You can just scroll over it and it'll pop up and say present now."
"10690910","10691230"," Yeah."
"10691650","10693430"," Do you have a do you have a sex monitor or no?"
"10694310","10694630"," Yeah. "
"10695670","10696810"," Do you see what I have here?"
"10697670","10698530"," Let's see if we can see what you got."
"10700650","10701530"," Yeah, hold on here."
"10701610","10717920"," Let me give me a second here and I'm going to make this the hold"
"10717920","10718780"," on a second here. "
"10723080","10724760"," Bring this up for everybody."
"10724920","10725140"," Hold on."
"10725260","10727280"," Let me go to the, let me go to a full page here, brother. "
"10728980","10729860"," All right."
"10730280","10739720"," Let me get rid of my, say something really quick."
"10740540","10740980"," Yeah. "
"10742060","10742540"," Okay, good."
"10742680","10742980"," You're good."
"10743540","10743900"," In area. "
"10744300","10744600"," Okay."
"10745460","10750160"," I see that I'm sharing my, my training view at the moment."
"10750380","10751580"," Is that what you want to share or no?"
"10752180","10752620"," Yeah. "
"10753280","10753480"," Cool."
"10753820","10754140"," Start talking."
"10754500","10754860"," Do your thing. "
"10755280","10755480"," All right."
"10756060","10756320"," Okay."
"10757020","10757700"," Let me see. "
"10758040","10758400"," Okay."
"10758560","10760080"," So, so this is a perfect example."
"10760520","10767180"," Like, like I told you, you know, I'm always waiting for a setup to form from noon, right?"
"10767420","10767840"," Your time. "
"10769140","10774160"," And you see how this one here, you have Q1 that starts exactly at noon."
"10774980","10779420"," Look, the thing is I'm always looking for a high and a low to form in Q2."
"10779980","10782320"," So, you see how it's fractal?"
"10782820","10787260"," Like today, the entire day is, for example, a manipulation day. "
"10788640","10790300"," And you have to look real quick."
"10796470","10797530"," You see the red bar here?"
"10799230","10799730"," Yep."
"10800990","10801490"," Okay. "
"10801830","10802590"," So today's manipulation."
"10804210","10808750"," But for the monthly, we are in a distribution somehow."
"10809270","10815250"," So, and what they basically divide the day up in these quarters. "
"10815870","10819460"," And, you know, to be honest, I don't really care what goes on if it's Monday or Tuesday."
"10820300","10826300"," What I, what I look for is either a high or a low to form in Q2 or Q3 to"
"10826300","10827220"," trade Q4."
"10829120","10830740"," Up or down doesn't matter, right?"
"10831020","10832000"," Up or down doesn't matter. "
"10832220","10832780"," No, I don't care."
"10833280","10836620"," If it's low, I long and if we're high, I go short."
"10837200","10843720"," Like today, like, you know, like this thing is, look, for example, if I told you I'm looking for a"
"10843720","10845460"," setup, always at noon, right?"
"10846100","10847900"," And you have this micro open. "
"10848160","10854860"," But the thing is that like, in this case, it's difficult for me to go long, even though I think"
"10854860","10859280"," we should go up to 44.30. And what I told you that 44.38 that I have marked out"
"10859280","10860480"," on top here, right?"
"10860960","10862080"," Yeah, I see it."
"10862960","10863360"," Yeah."
"10863760","10867160"," But I prefer something lower, you know, to buy the dip. "
"10867520","10870180"," Now I didn't do any chart in much order because I was talking to you."
"10870180","10878660"," So I have no idea what the hour that you're doing and what it is."
"10878660","10880680"," I have no idea what the hour to close up in nine minutes. "
"10881340","10883160"," And then something will develop."
"10883660","10886400"," And in the meantime, I know we have this one here."
"10887280","10887840"," Mark that. "
"10889060","10893580"," And depending what this candle closes off, at, we'll see."
"10894000","10900420"," Because if we remain above here, this is a place where I would look for long to go to my"
"10900420","10900680"," target."
"10901420","10902500"," This one here. "
"10903000","10906260"," Yeah, I'm always looking on those half hour candles for that same setup there."
"10906800","10909000"," Yeah, well, you could use a 30 minute one as well."
"10909200","10910820"," But I look for inefficiencies that here. "
"10911200","10913160"," But you know, these are all clean at the moment."
"10913160","10917040"," So I don't, I don't really see something happening in here."
"10917420","10921340"," And however, the 30 minute one, for example, let's see where they'll stop it. "
"10921520","10922520"," You see the midpoint of it."
"10923540","10928400"," Yeah, that's what I'm always looking for is that 30 exactly that 30 minute candle I'm looking for"
"10928400","10932240"," to make sure that it doesn't start breaking below that half waypoint of that previous candle."
"10933020","10939060"," Yeah, like closing candle below that previous half hour bar. "
"10941070","10947150"," And but the thing is, is that usually when a high is forming Q2, a low is forming Q3, and"
"10947150","10950330"," then they will continue on and do a continuation in Q4."
"10951530","10959990"," So, yeah, in this case, you know, I would think we go down a little bit, and then we go"
"10959990","10960650"," retest the highs."
"10962510","10968450"," And if you can go short, this is the place where you need to go short from up and then"
"10968450","10968850"," go down. "
"10972550","10974530"," Yeah, the drop them out the same way I do."
"10975230","10977250"," So I always, I'm open to both scenarios."
"10977570","10981970"," But once, you know, the thing is, one, we're not in an area that I want to participate in that"
"10981970","10985250"," I have marked up beforehand, even though we did take up the stops. "
"10985370","10989070"," And it's a free drive pattern, they call it, and then you can take a short from here."
"10989870","10992750"," If you're aggressive, and where do you go?"
"10993150","10997190"," Because we broke the structure here, you know, and we're back below the previous day high."
"10997510","11003570"," And you can see here that we even retested it and rejected it. "
"11003870","11006950"," So let's see what they will do."
"11008470","11013370"," So you're looking to break above that tweezer there in that half hour candle to take it out along"
"11013370","11016590"," or for the extreme on the look down side, right?"
"11017330","11025650"," You know, the thing is that I don't like to chase at all, you know, and like when we're already"
"11025650","11032810"," like this up high, and unless I have a real strong conviction that we're going to go up, I will"
"11032810","11033230"," take it."
"11033370","11035930"," But the risk reward is just not there for me at the moment. "
"11036190","11041730"," You know, I'll rather wait until tomorrow morning for a setup that I know where I can, you know,"
"11042230","11047310"," the reference of, because like a lot of times around noon, you will get the high of the day set"
"11047310","11050150"," in normal, like circumstances."
"11051950","11057090"," But like days like today, you know, when the market is trending in a specific direction, that's"
"11057090","11057970"," when they do break them."
"11058650","11064690"," And yeah, and you can take along from here, but you know, will you get all the juice that you"
"11064690","11064890"," want?"
"11065410","11069710"," Because I think the group that we did today was impressive already, you know, it's like from the"
"11069710","11078210"," low to the high, we're up already like let's see 56 points. "
"11079250","11080310"," Yeah, it's a good day."
"11080450","11083490"," And I'm wondering, too, let me switch back over real quick."
"11084090","11087730"," Let me get back to the one here. "
"11088850","11090350"," That's the main screen here."
"11091670","11094990"," I'm going to just switch back to just your view of your face."
"11095790","11098470"," How do you, can you stop presenting?"
"11102230","11104630"," Yeah, we just wanted to point out real quick. "
"11104750","11105670"," Hold on, let me go put you back on."
"11106450","11114670"," Yeah, what I wanted to point out real quick regarding the quarters is that you, you can see that"
"11114670","11120170"," there's this tool, it's called, it's name, I think, let me see what it name is."
"11123070","11124270"," It's called day's quarter theories. "
"11125630","11127670"," And I highly suggest you read it up."
"11127970","11132910"," I think I even pin some information on how to use them in the dashboard."
"11134270","11139590"," But look it up, because like if you were able to figure out what happens in Q2, which are the"
"11139590","11144530"," red ones, as you can see, like here, this is a low. "
"11152190","11153990"," From this area, see."
"11156210","11163450"," And regarding the Asian sessions, just point you out real quick what they did this morning."
"11164050","11164450"," Yeah, yeah. "
"11164730","11171310"," Show them the Asian session and then the London Open and the cash market open."
"11173250","11175690"," Yeah, so this is the Asian session."
"11176930","11177810"," It's quite simple. "
"11178230","11182450"," I have this box that gets drawn, which ends at midnight, New York side."
"11183230","11186590"," The only thing I wait for, because you can take both sides of the trade, right?"
"11188650","11190390"," So what do I keep track of?"
"11190570","11191190"," The midpoint of it?"
"11192530","11194070"," The high and the low."
"11195930","11202550"," And you can see here, you know, when these stops get taken out, which happens at 3am, you see?"
"11202790","11203890"," Yeah, I see it over there. "
"11204470","11204850"," Yeah."
"11205310","11209330"," So they dip it down, take out the stops, and then they make a double bottom."
"11209670","11213750"," And then, you know, you get a nice trick, like, you know, be realistic with your expectations,"
"11213930","11220070"," because the only thing I target for, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. "
"11220090","11222530"," You know, I target the mid and either the high."
"11222830","11227690"," And in this case, we didn't even reach the high, you know, and that was suspicious of me because"
"11227690","11231750"," that's where I pulled the plug because I exited my calls here."
"11232750","11235330"," And when it started to consolidate, like that, you know?"
"11235650","11237110"," And that's where your pivot's coming, right?"
"11237410","11244970"," So you're, so as you're using these rules, you're still using pivots on the trade, whether it goes"
"11244970","11247950"," up to that pivot, then reverses back to the downside, gets underneath. "
"11249090","11249530"," Exactly."
"11249530","11255010"," Because I thought we were going to go reach us the high of yesterday already, you know, which we"
"11255010","11257490"," did, but we went I don't know how deep."
"11258890","11262190"," But, you know, so in the end, at the end of the day, your thesis is right. "
"11262390","11264650"," But, you know, how do you make it tradable?"
"11264910","11269170"," Because, you know, yeah, and you get that level down there to that same, that same, they didn't"
"11269170","11270790"," touch that second level down below there."
"11270990","11274910"," That's what I was wondering if they would close that last little level down there, but they didn't."
"11275070","11275750"," This one here. "
"11276470","11286420"," Now the one below, you know, we're like, this one, three, five, eight, five zero, the yellow one,"
"11286420","11287620"," so the second yellow one down."
"11288420","11289460"," Not the top one."
"11289620","11292620"," Yeah, well, if it's bullets, you want it to hold here. "
"11292800","11293640"," Yeah, actually here."
"11293980","11298960"," And I'll show you why, because it's fairly, it's quite simple where that level comes from."
"11299900","11300740"," Mm hmm. "
"11301460","11305640"," On a daily chart, you have this inefficiency happening here."
"11306280","11307040"," See here?"
"11307320","11307560"," Yep."
"11307940","11309420"," You have the high of Friday. "
"11309960","11310240"," Yep."
"11310620","11312260"," And the low of last Tuesday."
"11313680","11315060"," We dropped below it. "
"11315480","11322340"," And, you know, because like the gap that we had here also, Yeah, they closed all that gap right"
"11322340","11323560"," there, but not this one."
"11323760","11325440"," Yeah, no, exactly."
"11325820","11332380"," So I wanted to keep that level on there, because I was expecting it to be bearish to trade through"
"11332380","11335040"," it, you know, and then maybe go here at some point. "
"11335440","11342000"," You know, it's like I'm open to both scenarios always, because if this done that, because like if"
"11342000","11346480"," we break below here, then I'll short it from here, you know, Yeah, to go back down here."
"11346760","11353300"," But, you know, my alerts went off and they just, well, you see where we are now, you know, exactly."
"11353900","11355100"," They held it. "
"11355280","11361720"," And is it worth taking the long Yeah, it is, because like, if you, if you take the long here,"
"11362140","11364700"," you have an entry here."
"11365040","11367300"," Yeah, that's that sweet sexy down there."
"11367380","11368280"," That's what I want is that. "
"11368420","11368520"," Yeah."
"11369200","11371520"," And this is the pattern I look for, basically."
"11371640","11376360"," So I do not care, you know, if it touches one of these areas that I already have marked out,"
"11376560","11385780"," I mean, seeing this happening here, like making this low and then breaking this high here that I"
"11385780","11386820"," have here, like that. "
"11387060","11387500"," Yeah, yeah."
"11388400","11393820"," Tapping that it needs to break it, even if it's by one tick, one tick, one fucking tick."
"11394540","11395320"," I don't care. "
"11395500","11399740"," And then, you know, it's it's go time for me, because then I'm like, I can't wait till it comes"
"11399740","11400180"," back here."
"11400180","11403620"," But you know, you also have to have the patience, because it takes like 20 minutes for it to get"
"11403620","11404040"," down here."
"11404660","11407740"," But then like, this is your long officially. "
"11408340","11408740"," Yes."
"11410340","11415920"," So the moment you break that previous, that previous high on that huge low, it's like, it's, it's,"
"11416040","11418000"," you're off and running."
"11418820","11419220"," Yeah. "
"11419440","11424080"," And you know, where do I target for is, you know, I don't care even if it goes all the"
"11424080","11424580"," way up here."
"11424880","11425640"," I get out here."
"11426380","11430020"," This is where I exit, because I have these stops here. "
"11430180","11431420"," You see these relatively high."
"11431860","11432640"," Yeah, I do the same thing."
"11432800","11433460"," I do the same thing. "
"11434000","11434820"," And I don't care."
"11434960","11440740"," Well, and then I have other consequences because like the midnight open, that level was at $43.95,"
"11441260","11445720"," which is, you know, a place that they will always go back to retest it."
"11446940","11449960"," And they did, you know, yeah, and they did. "
"11450220","11451380"," And they went above it."
"11451560","11456700"," And you could have gone short from it, even, you know, to go back to test this, this high here."
"11457560","11459940"," And then, you know, you do whatever you need to do. "
"11460380","11462120"," Find the buyers still there, push it up."
"11462800","11472460"," And yeah, even right now, I feel the same way at this moment, like just looking at, just looking at"
"11472460","11472680"," where we are."
"11472680","11475620"," Well, like could this whole guess do I am I going to take it?"
"11475820","11483140"," Not unless we get above, let me go, not not unless we go back above and spy before 37 25. "
"11485800","11488680"," But we still, well, let me switch back really quick."
"11493060","11499180"," So even right where we are right now, if you're like, hey, we're going to, we're going to keep"
"11499180","11506760"," this, like Jimmy and I are all talking about this OPEX and this, these like targets upside targets"
"11506760","11509100"," for end of a month, right?"
"11509400","11511940"," That 4,400 that 45 31."
"11513220","11517620"," Even so David's basically saying like, even if we see this previous eye right here, right?"
"11518160","11522980"," Dave's basically saying you need to be above this to take that continuation trade to get there. "
"11523020","11525920"," But otherwise, you're going to be looking for that."
"11526140","11528000"," And it's 12 o'clock in the afternoon right here, right?"
"11528060","11532100"," So they came in to set 1228 right here."
"11532100","11534640"," But this 12 o'clock, we got a failure. "
"11535320","11536380"," Oh, it's right here."
"11536960","11542760"," Because that's what I was trying to say that 12 am right failure from buyers means they pull push"
"11542760","11546600"," it back down and try to find where that support is, right?"
"11546820","11549580"," And are those buyers still down here or not?"
"11550180","11551600"," So what is David saying?"
"11551840","11552840"," Sit on your hands here."
"11554040","11556160"," If I'm wrong about this, David, let me know. "
"11556440","11559520"," But so here's your 12 o'clock, right?"
"11560000","11563000"," There's your failure to find buyers, right?"
"11564120","11567140"," And then we're going to come back to the fact that support is actually here."
"11568040","11573620"," We're either going to come down here and trade this 434, 433 or whatever this 434, 93."
"11574880","11580480"," So you don't have a long trade here unless you get back above this this 437. "
"11581540","11583420"," So right now, that's the weird thing about it."
"11583540","11588400"," Like, like, you know, like, the weird thing is, I was long this right where we are right here."
"11588580","11589060"," You belong in it. "
"11589740","11597000"," Yeah, but I be very, I'd be scalping it, you know, like getting in and getting out and like not"
"11597000","11598160"," having not just for fish."
"11598260","11600820"," Let me see what the range is at the moment 4408."
"11600980","11605500"," Like I would target again the previous day high, you know, and then leave a runner because we have"
"11605500","11614300"," a micro open, like knowing that in Q2, which runs between 1223 and 45 is where a high gets made. "
"11614840","11617800"," And that we also have another quarter here where a logo gets made."
"11618620","11620960"," And then we either get a continuation or a reversal."
"11621760","11626480"," However, you know, this half hour chart, man, these this half hour bar right here, they're still"
"11626480","11626720"," here. "
"11626780","11629180"," These buyers are still sitting here in this half hour."
"11629320","11630500"," They have not given it up yet."
"11631680","11632020"," Yeah. "
"11632920","11639560"," And that's the thing, quick things getting in and out."
"11639760","11640640"," There's not, it's not much."
"11640780","11644800"," I grab five points and I'm happy with that, you know, I'm not. "
"11645760","11648140"," And that's a hard time, by the way, if you're watching at home."
"11649220","11651940"," Let me see what the 30 minute looks like."
"11656320","11660360"," So like for now, like we have an hourly close that we had. "
"11660860","11663040"," And I marked this for our value gap that we have there."
"11663840","11671940"," And I keep an eye on the premium."
"11672460","11674460"," I wait, I rather wait for a discount. "
"11674960","11682860"," And for me, I'll stay hands off in this case, because it met the criteria to me where I'm where"
"11682860","11686600"," it's making a higher noon and then, you know, pulling back a bit."
"11687020","11691580"," But you know, I'm still in conflict that I think we should go back to those levels that I mentioned"
"11691580","11692520"," earlier on the street."
"11693500","11695900"," So here is the one for me to answer. "
"11696060","11698360"," So here's the one hour low right here."
"11702730","11709630"," Hey, well, you know, what always helps is like, whatever high or low that you have, if it's a 90"
"11709630","11716590"," minute one or a one hour one, just wait for one of them to breach, because it will breach one"
"11716590","11717530"," of them no matter what."
"11719030","11722790"," It will always do it to take out stops to take the other side. "
"11722790","11727930"," So it even if you're bullish, if you're bullish, they're going to come over and liquidity break,"
"11727930","11728470"," you're right."
"11729150","11731130"," Yeah, down here, exactly."
"11731290","11735450"," Even if they're going to come back up and so if you're a person, everyone. "
"11735890","11743150"," So if you are bearish here, the idea here would be let's say blast down through here, you're still"
"11743150","11748950"," looking for the rejection on that one hour low, if you're going to put on the short."
"11749670","11755190"," So you need to pay close attention to, you're going to need to pay close attention to this stop"
"11755190","11755450"," hunt."
"11755830","11758250"," So there's a stop hunt going on right now, right?"
"11758910","11766290"," And yeah, and we like to be bullish, you can even drop all the way back down to 4,400. "
"11767210","11770250"," And then still go up, you know, it depends."
"11770650","11770710"," Yeah."
"11772290","11777090"," But like for me, the more like I always, the first thing I do, I set my alert in like"
"11777090","11782290"," in this case, 4,407, I have an alert set, 4,403, and at 4,398. "
"11783590","11785170"," Above that, I'm still bullish."
"11785710","11787150"," In that case, looking for longs."
"11787510","11797410"," But yeah, like the thing is, is like, I want to see it trade through 4,430 to go short. "
"11799660","11802240"," And as long as it doesn't do that, I'm not taking a short."
"11802920","11808500"," Yeah, that for that 4,430, the even the GANA profiles got some really wonky stuff going on."
"11808620","11815360"," It's got like a, it's got that 4,440, that 4,440, and then, you know, and the, and the"
"11815360","11820960"," best part, I mean, there are setups there to go short, because like, there was a fair value gap,"
"11821320","11825420"," like let's say from Thursday still that we got into. "
"11826200","11830540"," But even there, you know, we've reached the halfway point went above it."
"11830720","11833640"," And I'm like, okay, it's just not my setup."
"11834120","11836000"," I'm not recognizing it as a short. "
"11836280","11837640"," And this is the GANA."
"11837640","11843560"," There are people that trade those models, but it's just not mine, you know, and that's okay."
"11844420","11848420"," It seems like they're stepping in a little early here to sell that 4,400. "
"11848840","11850860"," I got the SPX gamma chart up."
"11850940","11854880"," Looks like they're stepping in early, but then we've got no stops here."
"11854880","11858960"," And then this 4,450 is a big point. "
"11860760","11862080"," This one right here."
"11862080","11864440"," And then this one, of course, is the other big node."
"11866460","11872100"," This one's kind of like not as big as important as I thought, but it seems like they want it"
"11872100","11874120"," up there for that for both of these. "
"11874780","11881560"," Do they do you ever notice that if they want to tag these that will push up past both and"
"11881560","11884340"," then bounce on top of that 4,450?"
"11885360","11889340"," Or do you think it's do they like tick strike it?"
"11891080","11893780"," Well, there is there's no mark."
"11893800","11899960"," What I love what I love what I love to see them do is like create a displacement above those"
"11899960","11900260"," levels."
"11900260","11903640"," So like trade above it through it. "
"11903940","11906460"," And then like then you get pulled back, right?"
"11906620","11907700"," Yeah, yeah."
"11907960","11913120"," And then it it falls back and then it creates a pullback."
"11913420","11916440"," And sometimes it takes time, especially on the higher time frame. "
"11916740","11922320"," You need to be patient because it doesn't show up until a specific time of day, for example, you"
"11922320","11923520"," know, so a lot of it."
"11924260","11932480"," Yeah, so I just wait because I can, in this case, I'm just going to wait between eight o'clock"
"11932480","11935500"," my time, which is I think to your time."
"11936780","11940600"," And I'm going to wait for yourself a bullet to show up. "
"11940940","11947940"," And then I'll trade off that because that's where they then we'll move the market again from."
"11948260","11951400"," But like, I don't know, we'll see where we are."
"11951780","11958540"," So one of the points where they are one of the points David is bringing up is taking out stops"
"11958540","11960100"," here right in this one hour low. "
"11960240","11962160"," It's not necessarily bearish."
"11964580","11969740"," But you as a trader, if you're if you're a trader and you're trying to trade this right here,"
"11969880","11970000"," right?"
"11971320","11974700"," The thesis here is don't get trapped in."
"11974940","11975700"," Hold on a second here. "
"11979230","11983110"," You don't want to get or not, I shouldn't say trap, but here."
"11984850","11986090"," Don't get too bearish yet."
"11986710","11988330"," Yeah, you don't want to get too bearish yet. "
"11988470","11992790"," If you're if you want to get bearish, you can, but what you're looking for here as a bear is"
"11992790","11994490"," if you have the blood bath down, right?"
"11994830","11996350"," You grab people stops here, right?"
"11997030","11999450"," The big fat red candle down, it looks super bearish."
"12000090","12008710"," What you're really looking for is from that capitulation, whatever this green candle is, this green"
"12008710","12011650"," candle fail on that one hour low."
"12013070","12016270"," If that does fail, you can begin to get bearish. "
"12016270","12021990"," You can set up the short trade or the long put trade to then take these candles down."
"12022770","12032450"," But if this candle on this on this on this stop on tier, if this green candle recovers"
"12032450","12039090"," to the upside, then that puts you into the into the finger trap, right?"
"12039650","12040750"," Into dead load in the middle."
"12041210","12044560"," And you can see this failure candle right here was bought right back up. "
"12045220","12047900"," And demand is pushing us higher, right?"
"12048220","12049740"," You still don't buy this."
"12049900","12053880"," You wait because this green candle is positive, right?"
"12054420","12057240"," But you don't want to get caught in this shit either."
"12057800","12060820"," So this is actually more bullish or neutral. "
"12061780","12067220"," But if you do get the break above, and that's the higher looking for you'd squeeze you trade that"
"12067220","12067800"," right there."
"12068280","12074460"," And then you get the reversal on the on the white red here, that white would turn and get the"
"12074460","12077580"," red back to the upside and have the bear trap right there."
"12078380","12083840"," So you're just kind of sitting on your hands in here bullish or bearish this price action you don't"
"12083840","12086340"," fuck with you just kind of sit here and let it play out. "
"12087080","12088400"," Is that right or wrong, David?"
"12088540","12089020"," I get that wrong."
"12089240","12095780"," Or if you want to ask or say, um, it depends on what you're anticipating from it."
"12095940","12097880"," You know, like, I am. "
"12098100","12101140"," Is there a trade here for you long or short right now where prices?"
"12102280","12105340"," Yeah, I just went into some calls."
"12106120","12107220"," He dirty dog."
"12109380","12110600"," I couldn't resist. "
"12111260","12114700"," I've already started to scale like me early like I am always early too."
"12116040","12116660"," Hold on."
"12116720","12117160"," I'll join you. "
"12117220","12121800"," Hold on a second here."
"12121800","12123500"," I wait for this bottom to hit."
"12123720","12126060"," And then I had 57 only going to do 10. "
"12126460","12127280"," So let us think."
"12130560","12131180"," That's so."
"12133590","12134690"," I already scaled that. "
"12134850","12136750"," We're gonna already got three contracts."
"12138650","12143130"," You know, I just like to see these premiums because when they drop like two bucks, you know, I just"
"12143130","12145790"," grabbed them because they dropped them down to 1250."
"12146370","12155530"," And then, you know, I did 43 70s. "
"12159870","12165490"," You was wondering the other day, you know, it's like, it's a good like this is the kind of thing"
"12165490","12171510"," here where I'm looking at it right now and I'm like, eh, it's we're either going, we're either"
"12171510","12176030"," going up here or if we start to roll, I'll fucking stop myself out down here."
"12176030","12184390"," So, um, this is the place to put some, put some some kind of some kind of risk on."
"12184970","12190050"," Yeah, but it's like, like, you know, even if it goes against it, it's still the place, it's still"
"12190050","12190390"," the place. "
"12190390","12193450"," So, this previous little right here."
"12195490","12201510"," And that's the thing because like if you, if you try to take longs at the high, there's no point"
"12201510","12202590"," dude, there's no point."
"12203390","12204090"," I don't do it. "
"12204810","12210250"," And like in this case, you know, we had our high in Q2, what I say, you know, which, which"
"12210250","12216770"," I always expect around 12, between 12 and 12 30, the second 90, when the minute window that I play"
"12216770","12219910"," with, where they're going to retest the 90-minute highs and the lows."
"12220530","12220970"," Yeah."
"12221730","12222910"," And I just tried that. "
"12224550","12225030"," Yeah."
"12225210","12226510"," And it's one 12 right now."
"12226790","12233210"," Like my, so it's system that similar system, not as complex, but like it's one o'clock right now,"
"12233210","12238410"," like in my view right here, like they got a pulls basically have a half an hour in my view. "
"12238570","12241390"," Like they, you're given the half an hour from one to one 30."
"12241490","12243770"," And then one 30 to me is going to be the critical."
"12244910","12248950"," They're basically giving it from like from right now until one 30, the goals are going to be given"
"12248950","12249710"," that last chance. "
"12250210","12255130"," If they can't turn this shit on in this half an hour, then that one 30 will get owned by"
"12255130","12257850"," the sellers and that we will send it to the depths of L so."
"12258310","12263470"," Oh yeah, because I've seen that happen too, you know, where I was, I got a fever bullish and then"
"12263470","12266910"," I thought, you know, I'm buying the dip and this kind of shit."
"12267230","12269710"," And then all of a sudden it just goes against me. "
"12269890","12275550"," And in those premiums, sometimes it's like, it's a shit because you can't get out, you know, it's"
"12275550","12275690"," like."
"12276690","12282270"," Yeah, like this is like, you already lost like 30% and I'm like, fuck, I should have had standing"
"12282270","12284410"," at future short or something like that."
"12284830","12290830"," I always look for those 30 minutes, because like whatever on that 30 minute, I'm always like, it's,"
"12290990","12297430"," I always noticed that you're getting like a, like a, you're getting a new low off that previous"
"12297430","12300750"," lower and new high on off that previous high in those 30 minutes. "
"12301830","12301930"," Yeah."
"12302690","12306510"," And if you fail to get those, look up for the other side, right?"
"12306730","12314850"," So right now, this next half an hour, simplifying this between now and one 30, it's one 14 right"
"12314850","12315330"," now, right?"
"12315770","12321850"," So like a seller must is required to get a new low from over here."
"12322710","12329950"," So this, this red candle right here, they have, they have 16 minutes to create a new low situation. "
"12330150","12334270"," So if they don't get it and close underneath, we'll go up."
"12334290","12337710"," If they do get it, it's, it's usually pretty fucking bearish."
"12338950","12342950"," We'll see that, we'll see that preview that known support down below here. "
"12345450","12352510"," All this stuff here, 434, 434, 93, 33, and they're trying right now, they're trying to, trying to"
"12352510","12353950"," sell us out right now."
"12354350","12355630"," I'm still long here, by the way."
"12356550","12359390"," I need to see, I need to see that failure of that green candle. "
"12359630","12363370"," So let me have the look."
"12364170","12365270"," I'm still long here."
"12365490","12366990"," I need to see that fucking failure. "
"12370380","12377920"," I mean, you know, the thing is that it's, I don't know, I'm not supposed to trade patterns and"
"12377920","12380120"," stuff like that, but then I see it flagging like this."
"12380900","12386320"," And you just have to wait until it reaches a specific level, because like for me, it's quite"
"12386320","12386560"," simple."
"12386900","12390720"," You know, I tried a true week open, which is 4406 where I tried to log it. "
"12391040","12391880"," It jumped up."
"12392080","12394260"," I got out, you know, I'm skilled."
"12394620","12396220"," So it doesn't matter if it goes against me. "
"12396340","12397900"," I already bought my stop, you know."
"12398220","12403240"," So, and that's the thing, because if you, if you, it doesn't matter where you get in, but if you"
"12403240","12411600"," already have your levels planned, where you could, where you're able to scale, then you can have"
"12411600","12416820"," that buffer if it goes against you to get out, even if it goes further than what your stop was."
"12418220","12423220"," And that is what really changed everything that I did, is the scaling part. "
"12423680","12429180"," You know, in the first two, three points, as soon as I get it, I take about a third off"
"12429180","12430480"," or whatever I do."
"12430480","12432360"," It doesn't matter if you're trading microbes."
"12432840","12437760"," And if you, if you can't do the big ones, do it with the microbes, learn it on there. "
"12437880","12442000"," If you're not willing to take the 50 bucks risk on it, then you shouldn't be trading at all."
"12443940","12450600"," And, you know, I think that is once you see the dynamic on what scaling does to you and your"
"12450600","12459280"," theoretical average, for example, to your position, it gives you a breeding room to have a little"
"12459280","12461740"," tolerance to give it more room to do specific things."
"12463200","12471070"," The other part right here right now, there's a little bit more down there, not much market down"
"12471070","12471690"," there, so. "
"12476590","12479890"," Vic's bouncing really quickly, so you have a quick market update to people."
"12480550","12485050"," You get a large reversal on HYG to the downside off their 6 EMA and the one-hour trigger."
"12485050","12489270"," So I'm HYG going back down to retest those previous lows from this morning. "
"12489890","12497910"," Vic's parking itself up on the 27 EMA and a five-minute chart, trying to hold that 27 EMA to"
"12497910","12498470"," go up."
"12499190","12504030"," That's looking pretty, pretty bearish right now on SPX with that VIX."
"12504450","12508830"," Count Dixie is extremely bullish right now. "
"12509230","12516850"," Apple reversing on a one-minute chart below the the 27 EMA Tesla Tesla testing its 27 EMA."
"12517530","12520310"," Nasdaq testing its 27 EMA right now, so."
"12521270","12522530"," Mix bag right here. "
"12522790","12528810"," VIX and Dixie telling you to expect a roll and right now you see this pull up right here, this"
"12528810","12531530"," green candle right here and this failure."
"12531830","12536630"," This is probably going to result in a down move, so I'm going to end up taking a should have"
"12536630","12544230"," actually taken the should have got taken my stops right here, so right there should have taken my"
"12544230","12544510"," stops."
"12545290","12546610"," So I'm still long right now. "
"12546670","12550210"," I'm going to try to get out here in just a minute unless we do get this roll down to"
"12550210","12550750"," the net downside."
"12550750","12551790"," We're likely going to get it."
"12552390","12559590"," Target to the downside, $4.35, $5.58, $4.00 here. "
"12559930","12563690"," And this is just based on Dixie, the word Dixie's heading right now, and then VIX."
"12564890","12567590"," I'm still long right here, so I'm just looking for an exit at this point."
"12569150","12577070"," But that's weird because like this morning dollar wasn't moving and like against the market"
"12577070","12581190"," whatsoever, which was a flag for me. "
"12581270","12584170"," That's why I stayed out at the open."
"12584510","12591290"," Is there some clunkiness here that could be like even if we do roll it could be something where"
"12591290","12593690"," it's like down and then immediately straight up."
"12593690","12599210"," So I'm looking at Apple's got 177 that it's going to be looking for a bounce. "
"12601270","12605830"," So if they do reject this and it's if they do reject this and send this lower, there could be"
"12605830","12609350"," still be a dip eye in there, but I'm still long right now having sold."
"12609750","12616070"," And you know, it's more even more fucked up is still sitting on these fucking calls and I'm being"
"12616070","12616850"," giving a chance."
"12617350","12620790"," You got the bear cross forming up here right now. "
"12620810","12624010"," It's not quite there, but you got to see that."
"12624010","12624810"," I'm also still in that."
"12624990","12626890"," I still have one one. "
"12626890","12627230"," We do."
"12627950","12628850"," Yeah, yeah."
"12629410","12630810"," Yeah, it's the lug here too. "
"12630930","12634090"," It's $21.55 at the moment and they're trading $22."
"12634490","12635490"," So I'm still green on them."
"12635670","12641670"," We're not, you know, it's like like so right here there's a bear cross coming up, but even so like"
"12643490","12646790"," like timing of closing when you're when you're wrong. "
"12647750","12650870"," I'm like just giving that one bar right there before they reverse it."
"12651010","12651930"," Just give me that one squeeze."
"12652930","12655150"," See, I think I can get out of 23. "
"12655550","12656410"," I think I got a buck out."
"12656610","12660150"," Yeah, I think I got a I got a chance to get out here."
"12666220","12673180"," And this is why I like the like this is why I like taking them after after we cross above"
"12673180","12674320"," and then come back down. "
"12676120","12678740"," But you know, I'm good right here."
"12678920","12679200"," I'm good."
"12679340","12682800"," We're going to see what happens here and try to rain it down on us right now. "
"12682800","12684020"," I'm still long too."
"12684120","12684620"," I shouldn't be."
"12684800","12686320"," I get yelled at in stream for this, by the way. "
"12691120","12694400"," Let me let me ask you guys in the chat right now."
"12696720","12701300"," Let me ask you in the chat if you have any questions for David, do you want to ask him"
"12701300","12705700"," any questions in the chat or if you already have asked David any questions if you could repeat"
"12705700","12706140"," them."
"12707000","12713880"," I don't have a producer reading the questions in the background right now, but if you could ask,"
"12714120","12716460"," hey, buddy, then I'll be out of state of that. "
"12716580","12719300"," My bot is still long here."
"12719440","12725000"," So until we get that cross, yeah, until that fucking bot turns red, I'm still long."
"12725220","12727760"," So I'm I'm done with it. "
"12727780","12731600"," I need to I need to because like what I last week, I think it was somewhere."
"12732160","12733440"," I have to trigger."
"12733900","12734920"," How am I trading to?"
"12735100","12742560"," And I was looking at him, but I just like a little box that's like long short, long short. "
"12742760","12745120"," I'm like, what am I trying to do?"
"12745240","12750660"," I'm at least using at least at a minimum, I use it as like a should I be getting long,"
"12750660","12751840"," getting out of a long."
"12751980","12753880"," Is it telling me here to get out?"
"12754380","12759180"," It's telling me I can see a long because I need to I need to learn a little bit more"
"12759180","12763320"," about those crossovers, what what happens or what to expect when that happens."
"12764060","12770700"," Because I was I was I was looking at the past and I saw something change. "
"12770700","12772780"," Yeah, I've got two of flipped on the chart."
"12773020","12775460"," So I've got two different alerts on there."
"12775620","12781540"," I've got one alert that writes a bullish or bearish or something like that. "
"12782220","12792160"," And that one and that one is that it was the first time and you have looked to see that"
"12792160","12799160"," something was crossing over and I got to happen for a long time."
"12800040","12802000"," I've got some questions for you too."
"12802260","12806380"," As you're looking right now, people are asking questions in the chat. "
"12806600","12811000"," So I'm going to ask, well, wait here for you to get let's get through what you're talking about"
"12811000","12811100"," here."
"12811960","12815340"," Maybe we revisit the bullish bearish crossovers in the box at some point."
"12815460","12819060"," Maybe I'm leading you down a tangent rather. "
"12819460","12822720"," I'm asking people to ask questions that I'm leading you off on a tangent."
"12823460","12824020"," All right."
"12824020","12824220"," All right. "
"12824380","12824700"," Let's go ahead."
"12825740","12826560"," Let's see here."
"12828720","12832560"," S Y W E C G said, David, what are you trading?"
"12833000","12834860"," E S M E S or S P X?"
"12835920","12840560"," Two days out, question mark at the money question mark. "
"12840780","12841900"," What's your delta's on them?"
"12842000","12843920"," What's your expirations?"
"12844960","12849220"," I only trade the option that is where S P X flows on the previous day."
"12851100","12854840"," So you're only trading the options where S P X closed on the previous day."
"12855900","12856380"," Yeah. "
"12857140","12858400"," What else we got for questions?"
"12858480","12859760"," I don't look at deltas whatsoever."
"12859780","12861740"," I wait for the previous to get cheap."
"12862000","12862240"," No. "
"12863280","12863760"," Yeah."
"12863920","12867120"," I look at deltas, but I don't that's not a decision maker for me."
"12867200","12868480"," It's when the premiums get cheap. "
"12868740","12875080"," I do something similar to you is I track where the opening lows or highs on those options are."
"12875200","12879420"," And then I know if we're going up, that's where everybody's in or basically the algos are in at"
"12879420","12879880"," that low."
"12880320","12881900"," And they keep going back to that low. "
"12882040","12883540"," And sometimes they grind the theta off."
"12883840","12884060"," Yeah."
"12884520","12886780"," Theta grind though that option as the day progresses. "
"12887960","12891700"," And what I do keep track out is where they closed them up on the previous day."
"12891920","12899020"," So for example, it doesn't matter what option price I use, because I think you can determine it"
"12899020","12904240"," based on, well, I don't know, I guess if you go further on the money, then you do have a"
"12904240","12906420"," little bit of a problem, I think."
"12906880","12909700"," In the past, I started with 30 deltas. "
"12911460","12916100"," And then I noticed that like if it goes against you, it goes against you fast."
"12916720","12923860"," And like if I'm really convinced about like we're going a certain direction."
"12924880","12934560"," For example, like where we bounced today, I would have probably taken a call further into money, if"
"12934560","12940150"," not completely in the money, maybe, and then the day out. "
"12941330","12948910"," The, the unspy, what's fascinating to me, not as fascinating, but on spy, what's fascinating to me"
"12948910","12956130"," is the anything that's above like 30 delta, I can usually get some recovery."
"12958010","12964850"," But anything above that, like the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, they're like highly directional with like one"
"12964850","12969510"," dates, two dates, like you're in for the direction only, you caught the right direction only."
"12970410","12979230"," And not the, like the, I guess I should say like, so if I'm, if I'm buying like a 30"
"12979230","12986030"," or closer delta, like 30s, 20s, 10s are in the money, let's say I buy it at that, like, let's"
"12986030","12988890"," say, let's say a 30 delta call opens at 10 cents. "
"12989790","12994230"," It tends to hold that 10 cents if we're directionally heading up all day long."
"12994350","12999250"," If I don't, it's like a 40 50 delta was like a three cent or two cent or a five"
"12999250","12999510"," cent."
"12999830","13005390"," I'm not using the best example here, but they'll still, they'll grind way farther down than that"
"13005390","13006870"," five or seven cents. "
"13007110","13011450"," It would like, instead of putting back to bounce off seven or bounce off 10 or bounce off 12, it"
"13011450","13018210"," still stays, it was like still blast down, I'm using the wrong numbers here, but I still blast to"
"13018210","13020290"," zero at some point by the end of the day."
"13021810","13027070"," Because like, if I have a conviction, then it's going to go to a specific level."
"13028310","13033290"," Like intrinsic value stays with the closer delta is on zero and one day it's a better way to"
"13033290","13034010"," explain that. "
"13035730","13043190"," And the last few weeks, I've been looking a lot at the volume, you know, also a little bit because"
"13043190","13048170"," they need to be liquid, especially in SPX, you can have a little problem with getting them filled."
"13049250","13055630"," And since I chart those options, and if I don't have the right chart settings on there, it will not"
"13055630","13057250"," show me a single candle, for example."
"13057310","13059210"," So I need to switch over to the midpoint. "
"13059210","13065110"," But as soon as I do not see those candles trading on that strike price, I a lot of times"
"13065110","13066470"," stay out of that one."
"13066690","13072550"," And then I look for one that is a bit more, with a bit more volume, for example."
"13074620","13081500"," I'm always looking for the concentration of calls and puts on on each strike. "
"13081500","13088440"," And then I'm always looking at, yeah, I think, basically that's where like, where are they all"
"13088440","13089400"," positioned, right?"
"13089680","13094260"," And that's that's where the magnets are, right?"
"13094340","13097500"," It's always where all the puts are, where all the calls are."
"13099220","13107180"," Someone's asking here, they're saying, this is from goat boy 1989, he says, David and Cap, do you"
"13107180","13115460"," believe it's important for us as a retailer to think or quote unquote, believe that the market is"
"13115460","13117020"," controlled algorithmically."
"13117620","13122280"," We've just been, we've just been sold that it's a buying and selling dynamic. "
"13122280","13123320"," I don't believe this."
"13123980","13127200"," Goat boy saying he doesn't believe that it's buying and saying, you, you and I talked about this"
"13127200","13127760"," Friday, right?"
"13127920","13130040"," That we don't believe the real pricing in the market is real."
"13130880","13131880"," Oh, no, fuck no. "
"13132340","13137440"," I think the classic TA books and like, I've sold the side edit to manipulate the masses."
"13138440","13147440"," Like, like the market loses a trillion in a day or $55 billion in 15 minutes, like the liquidity"
"13147440","13149380"," gets put in by the central bank every day."
"13150120","13159620"," Every day, every day liquidity gets injected between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m. Came a bit late, so"
"13159620","13164420"," I didn't catch being so I don't, didn't tell your story history and how long you trade. "
"13164760","13165800"," Yeah, we've already told that story."
"13166260","13167200"," I'll put together this."
"13168140","13176940"," So bear town sheriff, we're going to put together a, I'll put them together montage or we'll cut"
"13176940","13181380"," the video, the interview down to where I'm like, I don't know what I'm talking about here, making a"
"13181380","13186020"," bad example, but I'm, I really mean this, like intrinsic value. "
"13186260","13186760"," You know what I suggest?"
"13187680","13195580"," What we could do is put the interview maybe tomorrow or on Thursday, I can get on stream and then,"
"13195580","13202900"," you know, when the Golden Nugget set up and folds and just, you know, walk everyone through if the"
"13202900","13204880"," ingredients are there that we would take it."
"13204880","13213040"," Like in this case, it was a short also, you know, but yeah, I don't like it when it's being"
"13213040","13215880"," done in, in the way of where we already."
"13215900","13218860"," Yeah, where we are right now and then, yeah. "
"13219640","13226040"," So, and even though it works because every single day it works, you know, it shows up in, in what"
"13226040","13230160"," kind of form it doesn't matter because sometimes if you would get five points, sometimes you get 10"
"13230160","13230440"," points."
"13230960","13234260"," I mean, even in this case, I think how many points did it give you?"
"13235120","13238780"," When from 23 down to oh seven."
"13239640","13245360"," Yeah, David and I talked about Friday about I'm gonna spend some time with him. "
"13245360","13250840"," He's gonna spend some time with me, put me through the combine and then we're gonna try to get him"
"13250840","13251520"," on the air."
"13252260","13254760"," Maybe just stop in or maybe make some videos."
"13255320","13258620"," So I think that's, that'll be like that whole follow-up there. "
"13259320","13259880"," What else do we have?"
"13259980","13261260"," We got another, let me see what else we have it."
"13262320","13264940"," David, how are your liquidity zones identified?"
"13266500","13267900"," The reason swing high and low."
"13268360","13273120"," Do you want to show an example of it if we, if you share your screener again?"
"13274960","13275320"," Yeah. "
"13275960","13276320"," Yeah, okay."
"13277360","13278340"," Let's see if I can go to it."
"13278540","13282180"," You got a full screen of your handsome guy. "
"13289360","13295520"," Yeah, I went to the gym and then I came home and I saw that discrepancy and the XY happening"
"13295520","13295900"," still."
"13296680","13301900"," And then I went for a walk because we have some nice weather here."
"13303260","13308280"," And I had to go to the vet with my cat because she's like, has been in diarrhea for like"
"13308280","13309000"," three months now. "
"13309240","13310640"," Oh, no, three years, by the way."
"13310980","13311140"," Yeah."
"13312000","13312440"," Stucks. "
"13313080","13314940"," She just shits over the floor everywhere."
"13315260","13318200"," It's some of my entire fucking house smells like shit sometimes."
"13318380","13325140"," Oh, well, our our animals of, I mean, like, I noticed that animals are expensive. "
"13325640","13329500"," Like, I was like, yeah, they are in Europe."
"13329520","13331000"," It's even it's crazy."
"13331540","13336700"," You know, it's like, you go to the vault for like 15 minutes and get one shot in your, yeah,"
"13336900","13337920"," it costs like 80 bucks. "
"13338140","13339360"," But I got more pleasure from it."
"13339440","13339880"," So I don't care."
"13340120","13340980"," So it's fine. "
"13341220","13344540"," Let me know when you want to share your screen and I'll put you on full screen here."
"13345480","13346380"," Okay, cool."
"13347140","13354700"," A lot of the share hold on one second. "
"13357300","13358760"," Let me start off with a clean chart."
"13362870","13363110"," Okay."
"13363710","13364370"," All right, I got you. "
"13365350","13369730"," I like the white and green candles too, by the way, I used to use red and white."
"13370590","13370950"," I like them."
"13371250","13374130"," You can, you can use my template if you want. "
"13374390","13375070"," I'll share it to you."
"13375170","13376170"," And then you can just save it."
"13376470","13379230"," And then right now it's the pivot. "
"13385530","13388650"," You see bulls lost a half an hour on 130."
"13388770","13394430"," We immediately started selling down now trading four 35 64 here."
"13397120","13398440"," 132 in the afternoon. "
"13406180","13410380"," So when I start off the day, it's quite simple."
"13410920","13412940"," I look for the previous day high and low."
"13413280","13414520"," And one of them will be taken out. "
"13415580","13416120"," That's it."
"13418860","13426400"," So in this case here, I had a fair value gap there because we have this weekly opening gap that"
"13426400","13427100"," it's still open."
"13427800","13431520"," Because we basically got the go on Sunday, on Sunday. "
"13432120","13433240"," We never touched it."
"13434060","13440660"," And that zone, I don't know, we might revisit it later in the week, or maybe sell off this week."
"13441060","13441400"," I don't know. "
"13441400","13445560"," I hope it would be good that this morning, but they left it and when I took out the other"
"13445560","13446960"," side of it."
"13447080","13447200"," Yeah."
"13447340","13447500"," Yeah. "
"13448200","13451260"," Because what they basically tested was the low from last Tuesday."
"13455110","13458010"," Did that answer your who asked that question here?"
"13458670","13461670"," So that's why I had a 4366 mark down there."
"13462330","13465610"," And do you mark the previous week size and lows as well or no?"
"13466530","13466770"," Yes. "
"13467130","13468210"," Areas of interest as well?"
"13468210","13469130"," Let me tell you."
"13469250","13469950"," Yeah, yeah, definitely."
"13473430","13476650"," Because I there's a set up, they call it like an order block. "
"13476850","13477690"," It could be in development."
"13478110","13481790"," But it's going to take a day or two for it to turn out or not."
"13482210","13488250"," And it did break through it where I have my levels that I wanted to take it. "
"13488350","13491970"," But yeah, we'll see what we'll get."
"13492230","13497110"," But I look at the previous day high and low, and one of them will always get taken out unless"
"13497110","13498190"," it's an inside day."
"13498370","13498970"," But those are rare. "
"13499690","13503970"," So and that's where I take the short order long from always."
"13505290","13512050"," Now when you're fighting those when you're finding those liquidity zones, the up and down side, are"
"13512050","13519910"," you trying to trade off those if it bounces on the bottom side of the liquidity zone you're trying"
"13519910","13523630"," to trade off those and then trying to sell the top of the liquidity zone."
"13523810","13527430"," And then if we break above and below you'll take your stops and trade that. "
"13527430","13537460"," Yeah, like the setup that I showed you on the on the one minute chart, like this, which you"
"13537460","13541500"," see happening here, this pattern in this area."
"13542880","13543320"," Yep."
"13543680","13544180"," Yep, I'm looking. "
"13545420","13546280"," I like that."
"13546600","13550560"," And even if it's a short or low, you know, I'm just inversing the chart."
"13550980","13556340"," But you know, look, the thing is it's like, what do you see up here?"
"13556940","13562840"," It's the same thing, you know, every city gets to go back here. "
"13564520","13567300"," It almost looks like the love that we had this morning."
"13568140","13571420"," See, now they bounced off the pivot just then at that moment's here."
"13573020","13575680"," And you said that this was manipulation day, right?"
"13576100","13578640"," So you're seeing the manipulation today the grind. "
"13580760","13583020"," Yeah, I'm not gonna distribute until tomorrow."
"13585220","13588080"," Yeah, that's what we're talking about the we were talking about."
"13588440","13590060"," We got Biden tomorrow. "
"13592680","13595680"," Ostensibly having an interview in Israel."
"13595680","13605060"," And then Thursday, we've got all kinds of speakers and some important news coming out."
"13607840","13611960"," But I always find Tuesdays as the most fascinating day of the week, right?"
"13613160","13619240"," Well, you know, a lot of times, it will form a high or low of the week, you know, Yeah,"
"13619440","13620380"," on Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"13621620","13621620"," Yeah."
"13622540","13625740"," So and then on Thursday, you can have the reversal."
"13626100","13630400"," But you know, Friday, for example, in the quarter theory, it doesn't, it doesn't take that into"
"13630400","13630740"," account. "
"13631120","13632920"," However, the micros you can track."
"13634380","13638780"," Because it's, you know, it's it's basically you discount whatever happens on Friday."
"13641030","13646310"," Let me see if I can see what I read some of the questions here from YouTube here. "
"13646370","13648350"," And we don't read me go through YouTube really quick."
"13653310","13653830"," Thank you."
"13653950","13655190"," So here was your entry short. "
"13657250","13664950"," David, what did you do before you became a trader and what you what made you decide to become a"
"13664950","13665250"," trader?"
"13665790","13668710"," At what point you decided to join Bob Pendel's group for education?"
"13669490","13672990"," I guess, what did you do for enough to give like your exact job?"
"13673230","13674210"," But what what were you involved?"
"13674550","13675510"," Like, what was your profession?"
"13676710","13680130"," Oh, I was working in the airline industry."
"13680730","13682390"," I'm originally a pilot."
"13682950","13687610"," And I was walking working in the operations departments. "
"13688190","13690010"," You want to show your big airline here?"
"13690590","13691970"," You want to show your face again?"
"13692990","13694090"," Oh, sure."
"13695150","13696530"," So you worked as a pilot."
"13697210","13701870"," And what made what like, I guess, let me ask you more pointy and class point of questions. "
"13703050","13705030"," What drew you to the stock markets?"
"13705030","13708050"," And what was your reasoning for getting involved in the stock market?"
"13711650","13715010"," Well, I was interested in it since I was a teenager, really."
"13715670","13719090"," And I was always like cracking stocks and those kinds of things."
"13719770","13722150"," When I was at school, weirdly enough. "
"13723770","13729930"," And, you know, I made some money on Bitcoin and those kinds of things, which I really like, which"
"13729930","13733830"," kind of set it off for me to do a little bit more."
"13733970","13737030"," But I also lost a lot of money with trading cryptos."
"13737250","13742250"," I grew up tons of accounts because a friend of mine, he would tell me, you have to buy a"
"13742250","13742450"," ripple. "
"13743050","13751310"," I call it rip off, because basically, it's like a deflating asset or whatever it is, any rips, you"
"13751310","13752510"," know, short."
"13754090","13764050"," And I get a friend that trades out right now, get a"
"13764050","13765570"," hat everything at FTX."
"13765730","13770330"," I didn't have it in cold storage, because I was short on Bitcoin and I needed to have my bitcoins"
"13770330","13771190"," as leverage. "
"13772210","13773990"," So I still have that claim running."
"13775470","13780410"," And but you know, I never traded it with money that I couldn't lose or anything."
"13780410","13785270"," So, you know, it's not like it affects my life in any way or form. "
"13785570","13789330"," Were you trying to escape having to work for someone else?"
"13789610","13794550"," Were you trying to have a future or was getting out of the grind?"
"13794630","13796790"," What was the motivation?"
"13798050","13802630"," Yeah, I was I was trying to get that freedom to do it."
"13802630","13806850"," And like, you know, even though you have it, but like I'm sitting behind the computer still a lot."
"13806850","13809110"," So it's not like, you know, you practice it. "
"13809190","13814690"," But like, I will, you know, take some more time off in the future, because that's like, take care"
"13814690","13818670"," of my mom a little bit more and then fly down to the Caribbean where she lives."
"13819190","13820090"," Take care of her."
"13820290","13822250"," You had to do that recently, didn't you?"
"13823070","13827250"," Yeah, yeah, I went there for I think about two months in the summer. "
"13828290","13830470"," And yeah, I will need to go."
"13830610","13833890"," I think I'm going to go sometime next month, again, for a few months."
"13834530","13839380"," And what about what about that?"
"13839420","13844760"," That's what I was talking to you about, you know, as I, you know, trying to change my strategies a"
"13844760","13850460"," bit also in that sense, where I would be able to do like collect more premiums, you know, be a"
"13850460","13858320"," bit more passive in it, because like, I'm I'm a sniper when it comes to like trading futures and"
"13858320","13859840"," these options and scalping them. "
"13860740","13863020"," And I pull the plug quite hard."
"13863320","13867300"," And then, you know, it's like, if I get stopped, I don't care, you know, because like the next"
"13867300","13872620"," right, I will win my stop more than three times back, for example."
"13874600","13880140"," But I do want to be a bit more passive where I'm not spending up my screen time on it"
"13880140","13885780"," and I'm learning it now a little bit more about just like dividing my day up into specific setups,"
"13885780","13888480"," and then just waiting for them to develop. "
"13889720","13891040"," Are you a lot?"
"13891900","13899500"," Did you, how long we're doing we started investing or trading where you were you still working in"
"13899500","13903800"," the airline industry to just say, fuck, I got a bucket of money, I'm going to slam myself into this"
"13903800","13904680"," and start a new career."
"13905520","13906000"," Yeah."
"13906620","13911000"," How many years did it take for you to leave what you were doing and become a full-time trader?"
"13913510","13915270"," Once you saw before I became profitable. "
"13916310","13920190"," I think it took like two and a half years or three years."
"13920410","13920670"," Yeah."
"13921230","13925470"," Did you have any success immediately out the gate and then some losses and then success?"
"13925910","13932530"," Yeah, I had a lot of success, but it wasn't really that hard because like when I started paper"
"13932530","13936670"," trading and it wasn't doing it, well, then I really started to buy the dips during COVID. "
"13938250","13946130"," And when everything was locked up, you know, so but that wasn't that hard because like, I mean, we"
"13946130","13947810"," had these while still buying the dip here."
"13947870","13949290"," It's not about by the way."
"13949830","13951730"," I had no fucking clue what I was doing. "
"13952030","13957710"," Like, you know, it was just just logging the market every single day, you know, it's like, yeah,"
"13958270","13959550"," and it just didn't stop."
"13959990","13964290"," So, and then like, sometimes you would get these huge dips."
"13965010","13968170"," And then like, I would freak out, but I would also have like heavy losses. "
"13968690","13975130"," Like, you know, I would also like, I think my biggest loss was like $38,000 or something like that."
"13975310","13982350"," And one day, what about the fucking loss that you took on the bullshit with the the brokers being"
"13982350","13982670"," down?"
"13983110","13984630"," Yeah, that's what I'm talking about."
"13984810","13985410"," Well, that's that loss. "
"13985690","13985710"," Yeah."
"13986470","13986470"," Yeah."
"13987690","13990810"," And that affected me for like, almost a year. "
"13992290","13994170"," And you never got paid back for that, did you?"
"13994870","13996290"," No, no."
"13996950","13998910"," But yeah, I earned it back."
"13999870","14001390"," Like, so it doesn't. "
"14002990","14007930"," It's weird, because it's like, it was part of the system fault that was causing this."
"14008310","14013550"," But then again, it was also recklessness on my behalf by not managing my stops properly."
"14015170","14023450"," So I don't have anyone else to blame them myself, to be honest, in the end, because I'm the one"
"14023450","14028330"," that presses the buy button, you know, even though it was a system error, there were ways to get"
"14028330","14029350"," out of it somehow. "
"14029750","14039570"," And I just was a bit more passive than it into not taking the initiative and sniping that"
"14039570","14040390"," shit off, you know?"
"14040870","14048410"," Yeah, some of my largest losses I've ever incurred were knowing I should have taken a stop and run"
"14048410","14052610"," and not taking not taking that stop."
"14053350","14054770"," I don't do that anymore."
"14054950","14056390"," But on the big trades, I don't do that. "
"14056490","14061770"," I do I'll fuck around with zero dates here and be like, this is my goddamn conviction, or you've"
"14061770","14066450"," taken away 30 or 75% of the trade might as well just stay in it, or leave it in"
"14066450","14068050"," the pile with a shit that's burned."
"14069010","14072710"," But those are days, like, I just see them as stops."
"14073350","14077930"," Like, basically, it's like, I'm buying them, but I don't care if they go to zero, because like,"
"14078050","14085670"," like, in my mind, whenever I enter an option trade, that amount that I had put in, even though I"
"14085670","14093010"," am planning to put in the stop on it to limit the loss, but I basically count that option as"
"14093010","14101650"," like, something I can lose all from, because like, and for example, let's say a bomb goes off or"
"14101650","14102470"," something like that, right?"
"14103070","14103070"," Yeah. "
"14103930","14105670"," There's no way your stop is going to get hit."
"14106070","14107750"," And you're never going to get that premium back."
"14108190","14108670"," Yeah. "
"14111090","14118470"," So in my mind, even though I'm able to take a stop on it, there's always in the back of"
"14118470","14125030"," my mind, knowing that, like something could go against me in that trade, where I lose that entire"
"14125030","14125490"," premium."
"14125710","14133450"," So that's why I never risk a specific percentage of my portfolio on any trade to limit that."
"14133710","14136450"," So I do. "
"14136690","14145810"," So I do place significantly size trades against my account, but it's like six, five to 10 times a"
"14145810","14146010"," year."
"14146330","14149190"," I was like, say, five to 10 times a year, I do put risk on."
"14149810","14153850"," But I used to what I used to do in those trades is I would, if it started to go"
"14153850","14155390"," against me, I would stay in it. "
"14156070","14160990"," And I would, I wouldn't quite blow up my accounts, but fucking pretty fucking bad."
"14161310","14164330"," So I wish I was able to stop."
"14164330","14165850"," You put stops on the straight. "
"14165970","14166430"," What's that?"
"14167470","14173630"," I wish I was going to be like, some someday, I really hope to be able to be so aggressive"
"14173630","14177250"," in that sense to hudge them out immediately, with futures."
"14177650","14184010"," But the thing is, is that with SPX, you have to calculate every dollar amount."
"14184650","14187630"," Like, I don't know, I'm stupid, man. "
"14187890","14191310"," It's like, I could care less like what the amount is."
"14191530","14192870"," I just want the direction right."
"14193290","14195050"," And if my stop gets hit, it gets hit. "
"14196070","14200770"," And I don't want to be thinking about like, how many, how many futures conflict I need to to hedge?"
"14201310","14206450"," I feel like do you feel like you're more disciplined with larger trades or less disciplined?"
"14207950","14212610"," I feel like I'm less disciplined with smaller trades and way more disciplined with larger trades."
"14214510","14216850"," No, I like I like the same emotion."
"14216850","14220750"," It's more second, that's the X."
"14221430","14224530"," I have the same emotion that I have with trading micros. "
"14224670","14234510"," Like, sometimes I could like, if I'm unsure about my position or my direction, I sometimes revert"
"14234510","14237010"," back to the micros, for example, take a position."
"14237050","14242210"," And if I even if it's like a 10 buck loss, it still bugs me."
"14242550","14245530"," Like, I can't stand seeing the red on my P&L. "
"14245710","14246910"," And I know it's part of the game."
"14247650","14252090"," And, you know, but that's part of what you do to shut it down."
"14253130","14257550"," Yeah, like, I feel like you can't be in that you can't be doing this if you're not going to"
"14257550","14261950"," be like raging piss at any loss. "
"14262070","14266170"," Like, every loss I take is like a fucking nail."
"14266390","14271150"," It's just for the day, if it's for the week, if it's for the month, it's for the quarter, it"
"14271150","14272290"," like to me it."
"14272770","14277090"," And that's myself revenge trading sometimes as well. "
"14277370","14280470"," But I, you know, it's not like I'm revenge trading book to recover the loss."
"14280850","14289710"," But it's more of a way, like for the fucking entire day, where I set up to unfold where I"
"14289710","14292590"," know it will do whatever I think it will do."
"14294350","14296190"," And I will recover that loss. "
"14298650","14303430"," And I know it will come if you want to have down below have some more supply or some demand,"
"14303430","14305650"," some stink bits down even lower from here."
"14306290","14311070"," And that's down to that yellow layer, this one right down here."
"14312230","14315270"," So you can see the three of these targets down below right there. "
"14323530","14330050"," Let me see what some of let me just read the YouTube comments really quick here."
"14331810","14340130"," Thank you for your time and info today, David going to rewatch later as a trader, I want to ask"
"14340130","14349410"," about tax time, any things we should know to aid us with profits like 1031 I don't know what the"
"14349410","14350710"," I'm I'm based in Europe."
"14350710","14355630"," So I'm in this, I have a pretty good tax system. "
"14355630","14357030"," I've nothing who comes laying here."
"14357570","14358850"," Is it better than the states?"
"14359610","14360050"," Yeah."
"14361050","14365930"," Are there any rules against like wait, like I know Canada has some rules as to what you can't can't"
"14365930","14366730"," do to have any big. "
"14367370","14374310"," I know that I know I've been trading for three years and they haven't, you know, the spy right,"
"14374310","14381070"," something like that, you know, an SPX, but you can't unspy and SPX is cast settled."
"14381290","14384590"," So, you know, what you own it for for like a day."
"14385210","14386110"," Same with futures. "
"14386510","14387950"," You can own I don't hold futures overnight."
"14388530","14389890"," You don't hold futures overnight?"
"14392090","14393050"," No, never."
"14395190","14400190"," I'd rather take a call and we're to go against me then hold those futures. "
"14400670","14403910"," Do you someone that prepares your taxes or do you prepare them yourself?"
"14405330","14407790"," Yeah, I just I just I'm having a company."
"14408470","14413670"," And the only thing I do is I, you know, tell them what my account balance is."
"14413830","14415570"," And by the way, in Europe, they know everything. "
"14415930","14420130"," Everything's connected so they can just click in the system to see what the status is."
"14420290","14424150"," I think the interactive broker even shares that shit with them with with the IRS here."
"14424470","14426310"," Yes, you don't turn over to the guy. "
"14427130","14432990"," No, not even I do because my my taxes are a bit more complicated."
"14433290","14436970"," Because like when you buy a house here, you get part of it back."
"14438010","14442330"," And it's like, it's it's a rabbit hole. "
"14442470","14443690"," You don't want to discuss here."
"14443930","14445890"," It's like, there's a stack system here."
"14446390","14447430"," It's just so fucked up. "
"14447950","14449550"," In a way, but we pay a lot of taxes."
"14449850","14451410"," So yeah, you have better quality."
"14451410","14452530"," We have a job to write. "
"14453210","14457170"," Yeah, we pay like half half of our income is in taxes."
"14457170","14463490"," But like everyone does it with without any problems because like, we got the best health care"
"14463490","14464050"," system here."
"14464510","14468050"," And the best infrastructure, we've got everything that that is needed. "
"14468550","14472030"," And the quality of life here is so good."
"14473130","14475270"," We don't care that our taxes are that high."
"14475950","14478810"," Now you get a lot more sources that we do in the States, right?"
"14478930","14482010"," You guys have one if you look around the world, any of those, any of those. "
"14482990","14487570"," And I've seen it in a lot of places, you know, and then, you know, I've been to 85 different"
"14487570","14489070"," countries around the world in ready."
"14489190","14494330"," And then every time I come back here, I'm like, man, you know, anyone that is complaining about our"
"14494330","14496530"," tax system here in that it's too much."
"14497650","14503930"," They haven't been in in other countries, but still forces you to seek out to make more money too,"
"14503930","14504370"," doesn't it?"
"14504670","14505870"," It would to me, I guess it does. "
"14506950","14514010"," But but then again, you are like, you're also, I'm like, I'm happy with what I have here, you know,"
"14514130","14518810"," I'm not you know, the reason why I'm collecting money is not even for myself, you know, it's just"
"14518810","14523090"," because we're trying to set up this foundation and trying to support startups."
"14523770","14523870"," Yeah."
"14524530","14527730"," And I don't want to tap in my own funds for that. "
"14527750","14529350"," So I just put it from the market."
"14531620","14532240"," Let me see."
"14532640","14533880"," Cheatin is asking. "
"14534220","14538360"," So Cheatin is a long time supporter and helps out in the background."
"14539120","14543040"," Cheatin's asking a great listening to David, what is your view in the market for the rest of this"
"14543040","14544240"," year, maybe next year?"
"14545560","14546260"," No idea."
"14546820","14547200"," Yeah. "
"14548220","14550940"," According to seasonality, we're going up."
"14551640","14554520"," But I may bring up the seasonality chart."
"14554860","14555620"," Hold on, we bring it up here. "
"14556000","14559080"," But I could share, I could share mine real quick."
"14559580","14560580"," The one that I want to say yours."
"14561560","14561960"," Sure. "
"14562440","14563420"," Yeah, it doesn't matter to me."
"14563820","14571780"," And the thing is, is that I don't know, man, I just look at the previous high and low today."
"14571780","14573440"," And then I just trade that. "
"14573780","14579400"," And because like anyone that is trying to predict to see what it's going to be like in the year,"
"14580280","14581800"," it's probably going to be wrong."
"14583080","14589420"," Yeah, it's like seasonality works and does well, it works in that like a time frame works great, no"
"14589420","14590340"," matter what it works great."
"14591000","14592480"," You know, I see that it works. "
"14593560","14598220"," But I've been only paying attention to that to it since about six months or so."
"14598600","14600740"," And before that I wasn't using it at all."
"14601480","14603580"," So for me, it's it's still new. "
"14604000","14608980"," And so far, the way I've interpreted it, it's working flawlessly."
"14609340","14615500"," So I like, fuck, I saw one much earlier, you know, I saw the one decline."
"14616280","14617060"," I mean, it works. "
"14617920","14620280"," I've got it sitting up on my end right now."
"14620360","14621120"," And I'm looking at it."
"14621300","14622360"," And it's still showing. "
"14623580","14628260"," It's showing right now that that push up into the end of the week."
"14629500","14632560"," Into this end of the week, but then we get a new low coming into next week."
"14633480","14637720"," And another low and another I like the next 12 days is like sidewalk. "
"14638140","14644040"," So I should say after Friday, should be sideways and down consolidating for a larger move."
"14645120","14646160"," Let's see what you got here."
"14646460","14647560"," Let me show it to you. "
"14648160","14649520"," Let me show everybody out there."
"14653910","14654350"," Okay."
"14658750","14663270"," So we're looking for a reversal continuation in this quarter up until year and right. "
"14664210","14672250"," So and then at the discord, I I pointed out that from the second of October until the 13th of"
"14672250","14675030"," October, I'm looking for a low to form in that window."
"14675650","14675770"," Right."
"14676050","14682550"," So, and for me, the limit was around the 13th of October, because you can see the gray lines, the"
"14682550","14685230"," red lines, the yellow lines, and the orange lines, right?"
"14685950","14687970"," The yellow one is the five year seasonality. "
"14688270","14693690"," The 10 is the orange, the 15 is the red one, and the gray one is the all time."
"14694270","14702530"," So on this table here, that for the past 24 years, we should have a low form in October on"
"14702530","14703650"," all seasonality."
"14705290","14712410"," If we're in a bearish state, or in the past five years, we had a high developed in November, and"
"14712410","14713770"," another low in December. "
"14714270","14717450"," And other than that, there's always a high in December."
"14720220","14725760"," Now, here we have all different markets that are saying the same thing."
"14725760","14735280"," It should be the same for ES, YM, RTY, except for that Russell should have a high form in December"
"14735280","14736440"," or in November again. "
"14737480","14739340"," Now, what has happened this year?"
"14739880","14742340"," It's is it diverging from what had happened before?"
"14743360","14749320"," You know, and the thing is, is that like, I, even though the seasonality doesn't follow it"
"14749320","14756520"," completely for a specific time period, for some reason, these pivots, when it says it will turn, it"
"14756520","14760140"," will temporarily turn in whichever direction it's saying it will go."
"14760640","14767120"," So like even on the 15th of September, in the Discord, I said, you know, it's it's it's a weakness"
"14767120","14769160"," of window windows weakness right now."
"14769160","14773700"," So we should go down at least until October, which it did. "
"14774100","14775980"," And we bounced right off this area."
"14776240","14779360"," Yeah, it was the 12th or something about 15th of October."
"14780660","14783380"," Yeah, it was on the 4th of October, where we made that low. "
"14785720","14787760"," And, you know, we've been going up nonstop."
"14788300","14790420"," And then, okay, yeah, we have two days going back."
"14790860","14794940"," And now one day up yesterday, and now one day of a pullback again. "
"14795180","14798540"," But, you know, it could be that we are chopping consolidating."
"14798880","14802960"," Who knows, maybe we're accumulating shorts to go back down, you know, I don't know."
"14803200","14805760"," And that's why I'm saying I'm just watching it day by day. "
"14806480","14811420"," However, you know, like I said, I've been looking at this now for about six months."
"14812140","14815260"," So far, I'm impressed by how I'm using it."
"14815940","14821000"," But am I trading off of it, like putting on trades for longer than a day?"
"14821280","14822780"," No, I'm not, not yet. "
"14823540","14824060"," Do I want to?"
"14824340","14825000"," Yeah, sure, I do."
"14825360","14828180"," But I need some more conviction and trust in that system."
"14829260","14830880"," And I don't know when that will be yet. "
"14831640","14834860"," Yeah, I'm gonna let me share my, let me share my screen really quick."
"14835580","14838860"," See if I can move this over here."
"14843250","14844110"," On a second. "
"14848430","14867760"," Can I don't know if I can share my screen here, we're gonna try let"
"14867760","14869160"," me turn my screen off."
"14871810","14874810"," So yeah, just here on so on this seasonality chart."
"14875110","14881970"," And one thing I want to show you here is in terms of seasonality, you can just see here. "
"14884230","14888930"," Yeah, you know, you should to rent like right here, right?"
"14889050","14894790"," And of course, we, you know, we just rip faces off and then had that pullback still looks kind of"
"14894790","14895830"," the same direction here."
"14896590","14906470"," And then, of course, you're looking a week here should mark some kind of a high"
"14906470","14912770"," and then a pullback the next two weeks, then a pull up into end of end of year."
"14914510","14918070"," But just like this, yeah, I see the same thing. "
"14918330","14927470"," But still, even with seasonality, if you get those extremes on highs or even lows, you"
"14927470","14932650"," know, it kind of is it kind of, I guess if we were to look at this on like a,"
"14933270","14936910"," on a higher timeframe, it would all kind of blend together."
"14936910","14945130"," But the idea here would be if we stay with seasonality, that you get that last little push up right"
"14945130","14945450"," there."
"14947510","14950490"," And then we start that consolidation move down. "
"14951270","14956030"," And then you get that move up and possibly even up to test all that stuff up there."
"14957070","14959550"," But that doesn't put us really where we want to be, right?"
"14959850","14965890"," I think that's where some of the banks have said that that 4500 would be the end of the year"
"14965890","14966530"," at max."
"14966810","14973710"," And I think Jamie Diamond came out and said, he's expecting 3900 by end of year. "
"14975890","14979130"," Let's go back to the main screen so they can see it breakdown below the pivot."
"14979830","14983370"," Now trading the hourly trigger and the daily trigger on spoons."
"14983510","14986590"," So this full pullback happening later in the afternoon. "
"14986590","14989130"," This is very not quite similar yesterday."
"14990170","14995970"," And not only not, not even not quite we didn't get the full bloodbath and the squeeze are just that"
"14995970","15003010"," straight pullback into that straight pullback into the hourly and daily trigger here."
"15003450","15009850"," So the entire squeeze move from this morning at 930, 1030, the entire move erased. "
"15010690","15016130"," Big squeeze higher straight back down into the hourly and daily candle here will find out what"
"15016130","15017250"," happens next."
"15018830","15019450"," Nice."
"15019450","15024590"," Now I'm wondering about that with this whole gap down here that we left from this morning that 4am"
"15024590","15026810"," gap down here, we never close. "
"15027270","15031190"," I'm showing it back here, but it's that 4am gap."
"15031650","15033530"," Let me see if I can hold on a minute there, Dave."
"15033690","15034450"," I'm going to switch over here. "
"15035710","15037450"," So just right down here."
"15037610","15039990"," This is the gap that we were talking about this morning."
"15040750","15042030"," See that gap down here?"
"15042830","15044090"," They never closed this. "
"15044630","15046470"," They closed this gap right here."
"15047230","15049290"," But never close this gap down here."
"15049510","15055410"," So question becomes, do we go down there, close that gap and then you get your your next rip?"
"15056590","15058330"," Let me go back to the main screen here. "
"15060430","15065250"," Do they actually get down there and just put that pain trade on that manipulation trade?"
"15065630","15066570"," Oh, that one you imagine."
"15066570","15066930"," Okay."
"15067150","15068010"," Yeah, let's see what you mean. "
"15068690","15070050"," Yeah, it's it's hard."
"15070210","15071790"," Let me see if I can show it on this one."
"15072750","15073510"," Hold on here. "
"15073630","15081230"," Well, you know, those that gap had it on my label chart this morning, but it's there's a there's a"
"15081230","15081810"," gap sneaky."
"15081810","15083930"," There's a sneaky little gap right down in here."
"15084050","15085950"," This is all this all needs filled. "
"15086950","15090990"," It's the thing is is where I or 31 anyone."
"15091470","15091970"," Good."
"15092330","15094830"," What I what I suggest anyone to do on Friday. "
"15096250","15100310"," Mark the last tick and then on Sunday, the first tick."
"15101350","15104690"," And that's yeah, the Friday, the Friday, Sunday ticks."
"15105110","15105890"," Tell them about that right?"
"15106110","15106110"," Yeah. "
"15106830","15112570"," Yeah, like they're called a new week opening gaps from what I've learned from ICT."
"15112870","15114810"," But like they dance around them all the time."
"15115190","15117730"," And like you keep the past five or six of them. "
"15118650","15122030"," And that's the only thing really that's a different model."
"15122370","15129030"," That's a model in itself, you know, because the market just thing pongs between them all the time."
"15129630","15133830"," So once it gets rejected in the other one, it goes back to the other one, you know, that's how"
"15133830","15136630"," it keeps you back and forth, back and forth. "
"15138810","15140490"," So you're you're marking it."
"15140710","15145010"," So remarking the close on Fridays and the openings on Sundays, right?"
"15145530","15147490"," Yeah, you're tracking those every week."
"15148650","15149130"," Yeah. "
"15149370","15156350"," And that's what I was telling you the one that that runs from 43 51 25 to 43 56 50,"
"15156470","15162970"," I think, not saying it's going to go there because I don't know, they left it naked when we we"
"15162970","15163870"," barely touch it."
"15163990","15167070"," We only touch it in the London session on Monday."
"15167930","15174350"," And that was the low of the week so far, you know, so and technically we're making higher lows and"
"15174350","15175430"," higher highs still. "
"15176110","15177730"," So don't get too bearish yet."
"15178850","15179770"," I'm not bearish."
"15180050","15181990"," I'm actually I loaded a bunch more calls. "
"15182190","15184430"," I'm still I'm still long as I'm good."
"15185050","15186870"," So I'm long into the close here today."
"15187650","15191210"," I feel like it's I feel like it's a Mexican stand off one way or another. "
"15191430","15192690"," They're going to go up there into the bar."
"15192830","15194730"," My view is one way or another today tomorrow."
"15195530","15196410"," They're going up there. "
"15196510","15197090"," Oh, yeah, definitely."
"15197330","15197930"," I'm long out."
"15198990","15201270"," Yeah, no doubt about that. "
"15201590","15203610"," They can manipulate away all they want."
"15203770","15205130"," They can say whatever they want to me."
"15205230","15205550"," I don't care. "
"15208990","15217730"," Well, you know, the thing is that I feel like, you know, with all this worship going on, I just"
"15217730","15218730"," I don't know."
"15219290","15224070"," It's it's really hard to me to hold the position longer than than an hour still, you know, I get"
"15224070","15224910"," in and I get out."
"15225230","15231030"," I just I just like, I like to see myself as like a personality or just keeps getting these little"
"15231030","15231710"," bits of pieces. "
"15232690","15237490"," And I don't I don't I don't even care where we end the day, for example."
"15237830","15242950"," But what I do care about is like, what is the setup that shows up at like what I said,"
"15242970","15244990"," like a new York Times."
"15245650","15250970"," And is the Asian high or low going to be taken out at 3 a.m. in the morning?"
"15251290","15258230"," Because like I wake up every morning, my time around five 30, six o'clock. "
"15259030","15260390"," So that is your midnight."
"15261230","15268130"," That's why yeah, when I'm already awake, you know, and you know, I just wait for these three three"
"15268130","15268970"," moments of the day."
"15269010","15269870"," And that's it. "
"15270830","15276890"," Are you so you said that you're not no conviction into end of year or next year?"
"15277390","15278210"," Let me ask you another question."
"15278390","15284550"," Do you think that do you have any give anything to weigh in on whether the US continues to raise"
"15284550","15285890"," rates or hold rates?"
"15286930","15292170"," Or do you think they continue to raise 25 BPS 50 BPS?"
"15292510","15293970"," Are they done with their rate hike cycle?"
"15294370","15295010"," How about an Amsterdam?"
"15295470","15300090"," Have you guys don't you don't care personally or even with the market if they do or don't do you"
"15300090","15301570"," just small price?"
"15302430","15302910"," Yeah."
"15303670","15304990"," What about less?"
"15305370","15315310"," Do you know, the only thing where I noticed it is now is like, because like my car, it's, it's"
"15315310","15325030"," like, when I bought it like three years ago, like the first Tesla I bought, it was on a"
"15325030","15328130"," tax credit where you got half of it from the government. "
"15328830","15332830"," And then you had to lease it and the rates were like really low."
"15333190","15338430"," And I think it, and I went to look at a new car a few months back."
"15339730","15343630"," And then I noticed I said, fuck man, you know, it's getting more expensive. "
"15343910","15347510"," But the only reason why I was thinking that is compared to what I had before that."
"15347810","15352650"," And it was because the rates were not low, you know, how much so what are rates right now in"
"15352650","15353890"," Amsterdam on a new car?"
"15357030","15360150"," Can you get three to six percent or is it higher?"
"15362150","15363170"," It's a little bit higher."
"15363490","15365030"," I think it's four, something like that. "
"15365310","15367230"," Yeah, I think it was good credit right now."
"15367330","15369770"," You can get, there's some like lease deals out there."
"15369790","15373470"," And there's some new car deals where the rates are actually pretty fucking good. "
"15374710","15383430"," And you can actually, you know, I'm not selling my car because like, I have a 2018 model X, but"
"15383430","15385150"," I still have three super charging."
"15385450","15390610"," So even with all this energy shit, I'm not paying jack shit to load load up the car."
"15392150","15397610"," And as long as I keep this car, I don't have to pay for supercharging. "
"15398430","15401730"," The minute I get rid of it, I lose that option."
"15402570","15404990"," So, and the car is still brand new."
"15405530","15408570"," I mean, it's only driven maybe 20,000 miles. "
"15409470","15416810"," So far, we talked about that two years ago, we talked about how awesome Teslas are in European"
"15416810","15423830"," cities that are like made for not yeah, my car is a little bit too big because like in Amsterdam,"
"15423830","15427430"," like I'm talking about the charge is not the not the size."
"15427430","15428190"," Oh, the charging?"
"15428470","15431850"," Yeah, the charge like the distance is the time and all that stuff."
"15432630","15433550"," Oh, yeah, perfect. "
"15433890","15439230"," And I don't think that I think they're going to ban gasoline scar gasoline cars already in the"
"15439230","15439390"," city."
"15439510","15444070"," Like if your car is already older than 15 years old, it's not allowed to enter the city anymore."
"15444650","15445270"," No, no shit. "
"15446210","15446610"," Yeah."
"15447030","15448850"," Yeah, I did not know that they already banned that."
"15449070","15455550"," Like we're way ahead than what you guys are, you know, have been getting and then and like this"
"15455550","15457830"," process has been going on already here for like 10 years. "
"15458170","15464640"," Like I'm already on my second Tesla, you know, it's like, I've already been driving them for like"
"15464640","15465260"," eight years now."
"15465920","15470940"," I sweet sold one for we've sold one because we're gonna make a lot of money to sell it."
"15470940","15474260"," We kept the other one, my wife drives it and she fucking loves it. "
"15474420","15475300"," She loves her Tesla."
"15476120","15478880"," And I drive I never had a single problem with it."
"15479380","15481460"," I haven't been to the garage once. "
"15482720","15489180"," And I think like one of those Rangers came by wants to replace a till light."
"15489580","15490000"," That's it."
"15492020","15496380"," And how was the process when you contacted when they came to the house took care of it and it"
"15496380","15496680"," was done?"
"15497820","15500020"," I didn't even have to go down, they just opened it up. "
"15500220","15501700"," You just remotely opened the car up."
"15503040","15507440"," And then we didn't have to pay anything because it was in warranty."
"15508900","15511700"," So, yeah, I don't know. "
"15511840","15517020"," I haven't been to a dealership or a gas station for, I don't know, fuck no, I don't know how"
"15517020","15517180"," long."
"15518100","15519020"," I don't need to remember."
"15519400","15521000"," I don't know what there was any problems. "
"15521080","15522440"," None like zero."
"15523140","15529300"," And there's some like some of the trim lines on the outside don't match up exactly."
"15529680","15532920"," But I was also told that could I'll told that could I'll be adjusted too. "
"15533120","15539940"," So I'm like, I seriously have zero problems with with my and I mean, nothing."
"15541240","15550540"," Like, I don't even have like, like even but the only thing that doesn't really work well is I do"
"15550540","15551320"," have the autopilot."
"15551840","15553780"," Yeah, I was out of pocket, for example, on it. "
"15553780","15560100"," But they don't allow the FSD beta what you see on YouTube and those kind of things here in Europe."
"15560440","15563720"," So, and I doubt it will work here in Amsterdam with all the boys."
"15563720","15567860"," What next question for you was autopilot in Amsterdam, it's got to be crazy, right?"
"15568640","15574260"," Well, it's I don't think it will work because like, he has a human driver is even the fucking"
"15574260","15577340"," challenge to have all these bikes around you because everyone runs red lights. "
"15578160","15587780"," Like, like, starting the 8th of December, they are restricting in the entire city limit here that"
"15587780","15592460"," you cannot drive any faster than 50 miles an hour in the city 15 or 50."
"15593800","15594400"," 1515."
"15595460","15596960"," 15 kilometers per hour?"
"15597840","15599860"," Yeah, no miles per hour. "
"15599960","15600120"," Sorry."
"15600440","15600900"," Does it miles?"
"15601120","15601180"," Okay."
"15601740","15601760"," Okay. "
"15602900","15606560"," 30 30 is going to be the max in the entire city."
"15608300","15612000"," But like, now they're putting the bikes on the roads and with the cars."
"15612320","15614360"," That's what I noticed was the road with cars. "
"15615020","15620880"," And yeah, and they're they're saying the car is the guests, you know, not the bike and motorcycles"
"15620880","15625560"," are they you got you guys are allowed to weave in and out of traffic and motorcycles too, right?"
"15625820","15630420"," So you got to come for all that to or no, like a lane splitting here."
"15631060","15635100"," You have lane splitting there we call it's kind of where we don't have the room for that."
"15635100","15641760"," If there's a traffic jam, kind of, in a scooter ride up past some states here, you can ride past"
"15641760","15642920"," a stopped car. "
"15643020","15645600"," It's not allowed, but they do it."
"15645940","15646540"," But they do it."
"15646780","15649620"," Now you're starting to get a lot of these meaning cars like this. "
"15650320","15651340"," You have to Google it up."
"15651660","15656100"," It's called it's called it's called a Opal Adam."
"15657200","15657860"," Opal Adam?"
"15658780","15659220"," Yeah. "
"15660660","15662260"," I mean, Opal Adam, let me see."
"15662540","15664240"," No, I see it right here."
"15665100","15669840"," The Opal Adam is a city car engineered and produced by the German car manufacturer Opal. "
"15670300","15670980"," I got it."
"15671120","15673940"," Sorry, Opal Rocks, Opal Rocks."
"15675400","15677180"," R O C K S."
"15679310","15684970"," Yeah, I see the Adam Rocks Opal Adam Rocks of Vox all Adam Rocks. "
"15685750","15687490"," No, it's it's called Opal Rocks."
"15688030","15688250"," That's it."
"15688430","15689230"," Opal Rocks Electric. "
"15689830","15690410"," It's a mini car."
"15691010","15697830"," I mean, it looks like you got a lot of these people driving around in the city nowadays with these."
"15698290","15701910"," Is this the, let me see if I show this here and see if this is it. "
"15702190","15705330"," And they can't come out like big time, you know, they look good."
"15705810","15706150"," Some of them."
"15706270","15708470"," Is this the these the cars you're talking about here?"
"15711360","15712000"," No, look. "
"15714140","15716180"," Got Opal Adam open on Wikipedia."
"15716460","15721800"," And then down here, they got Adam Rocks, boost to boost sales of the Adam Opal launched across over"
"15721800","15723600"," convertible in 2013."
"15724700","15725840"," No, no, that's not it. "
"15726140","15727940"," Just just type in Opal and then rocks."
"15728660","15729360"," Opal Rocks."
"15729960","15730200"," One here. "
"15730540","15730860"," Yeah."
"15735860","15738060"," In the search bar, as we will."
"15738900","15741180"," Not the Adam Rocks, but just Opal Rocks. "
"15742480","15745060"," Yeah, Opal Carl, Opal Astra."
"15746140","15747500"," Maybe this is it right here."
"15748800","15749540"," Is this it right here?"
"15749760","15752720"," And then you have to look. "
"15753600","15754580"," Yeah, that's the one."
"15754940","15755520"," The top one."
"15756600","15757380"," An ugly one. "
"15757940","15759240"," The first one."
"15759480","15760200"," This one right here?"
"15760300","15760420"," Yeah."
"15761080","15761500"," Yeah. "
"15761700","15763680"," That thing is gnarly, man, and super small."
"15764280","15769100"," And what do they do?"
"15769220","15773040"," Are they converting them and like adding stuff to them, like ski racks and stuff?"
"15773220","15776760"," Yeah, no, not like that because they only use them for any city."
"15777180","15779660"," So to do groceries and like do deliveries. "
"15780320","15781120"," And that's so cool."
"15781640","15782040"," I like it."
"15782040","15782520"," Yeah. "
"15783020","15783420"," Yeah."
"15783660","15784780"," I bet it's cheap too."
"15785520","15786460"," That's the key, right?"
"15787280","15790140"," It's 8,000 euros or something like that per car like that. "
"15790280","15790700"," Are you serious?"
"15791660","15792060"," Yeah."
"15792320","15795880"," I couldn't imagine like a US maker truck just smashing into that thing."
"15796780","15798180"," Oh, no, no, but that's a thing. "
"15798540","15800580"," I mean, who the fuck is going to kill you?"
"15800760","15802600"," You can only drive 30 kilometers an hour."
"15804100","15812240"," Yeah, I get it now like I'm gonna drive five miles or 15 miles an hour because the car is"
"15812240","15812500"," like this."
"15812700","15813200"," Well, you know what?"
"15813560","15815220"," Like Detroit would do great with stuff. "
"15815340","15816180"," Well, like not too great."
"15816180","15822400"," But if Detroit, I don't New York is closing off some of their main thoroughfares right now."
"15822800","15824960"," And they're making him pedestrian. "
"15825900","15830460"," But if you had like especially if you had bad weather like you had bad like Detroit would do well"
"15830460","15830880"," with these."
"15831960","15835520"," Because if you were Yeah, it's cold air in the winter."
"15835920","15843820"," So people, even if you're going to make it pedestrian or more conducive to, you know, not big,"
"15843980","15848240"," having a bunch of freeways and freeways and all that kind of stuff, you're going to be like, yeah,"
"15848820","15851240"," we're looking towards getting some people walking here and on bikes. "
"15852020","15856740"," That's one of the things about Detroit is everyone's always like, well, it sucks to ride a bike in"
"15856740","15857560"," the wintertime here."
"15858300","15863660"," And car like that on the inner city part, like the center city of Detroit would be fucking great."
"15865100","15868300"," Because that would be a solution, especially for like in town stuff. "
"15870660","15876940"," You know, here, they're like really pressing all the environmental stuff, like anything electric,"
"15877080","15878320"," you'd get hard on to."
"15878940","15882800"," So it's like, yeah, this would be a solution."
"15883920","15889100"," Yeah, but you know, since since the electric cars have been introduced here, there's so much less"
"15889100","15890340"," pollution in our city. "
"15890780","15896660"," Like, I noticed it on my house, you know, there's just not, there's no sud in the gutters anymore."
"15896820","15900360"," And like, it's a fast, it was all this done coming out."
"15900360","15907040"," But now, like, seriously, I think about 30% of the cars here in the city already electric, you"
"15907040","15908600"," know, we're 40% even. "
"15909320","15914420"," Yeah, we'd be some minor, you know, it's where it's going fast."
"15915380","15920040"," When we lived in the West, we needed a truck, we needed like real true for all drive, all that"
"15920040","15920540"," kind of stuff."
"15920700","15921640"," We moved here to Detroit. "
"15922620","15926020"," We didn't we it's we needed electric car."
"15926380","15927460"," We have a truck still."
"15928620","15929820"," We have a catalytic. "
"15930120","15934080"," The thing is in the States, you have so much distance to cover, you know, it's I understand why"
"15934080","15934500"," it's needed."
"15934740","15940920"," It's like here, like, you know, I think I use my car maybe once a week."
"15942380","15944380"," Yeah, maybe once I do by bike. "
"15944880","15949260"," Yeah, I wish we were more bike centric where we're in Detroit where they're trying, but we're not"
"15949260","15949780"," there yet."
"15951900","15955460"," Just bouncing around here in the early trigger right now, not much action going on in the"
"15955460","15955760"," marketplace."
"15955860","15961320"," I've got some calls on, I bought some calls earlier about 438s. "
"15961360","15965320"," And then I added and then I added again, I've got a bunch of 438s for dirt Jeep."
"15966260","15970000"," There are some, there were some calls on the upside on 436."
"15970360","15972460"," They've sold them as of now they've bought a bunch. "
"15972860","15974880"," The algorithms are now bought 435 P."
"15975480","15980020"," But I'm parked on a bunch of cheap ass calls down here, waiting to see what's going to happen to"
"15980020","15980400"," this close."
"15980620","15985860"," I'm of the mind and thesis here that you don't have a ton of time to get to that 4440"
"15985860","15989720"," or above the 451 zero."
"15989900","15991880"," And so they're going to do it into Friday. "
"15992500","15994340"," They don't have a ton of time to do it."
"15994340","16000740"," So I'm taking a I took some calls that they were I bought them pretty fucking expensive, but only a"
"16000740","16001240"," 10 pack."
"16001340","16004500"," And then I added another 10 and then another 10 and another 10. "
"16004500","16008220"," So now I'm just sitting here waiting to see what happens into this close."
"16009340","16012680"," If you're bearish here, say something inside the chat."
"16013600","16015180"," But I'm still long here. "
"16015280","16022040"," This this looks like taking out stops to me still to and trying to fake you out for the eventuality"
"16022040","16022880"," of heading to the upside."
"16022940","16028720"," So I was originally planning to go short at 4430 around in that area."
"16028960","16031160"," 443 a I wanted to get that. "
"16031440","16032280"," I want to see that hit."
"16032620","16035960"," If that happened at noon, I would have taken the put."
"16038450","16039550"," Yeah, we've got that too. "
"16039630","16040870"," We've got people racing."
"16041050","16044990"," We got we got a bunch of stuff that goes on and we got like people racing Hellcats everywhere."
"16045190","16047270"," We got the dirt bikers and the four wheelers. "
"16047870","16052750"," The four wheelers and the dirt bikers I'm kind of pissed about because we have the space to give"
"16052750","16054510"," these guys tracks to run and stuff."
"16055090","16059710"," So that's kind of a failure in our part to help out the people that want to ride four wheelers"
"16059710","16060110"," and stuff."
"16061290","16062250"," But in the city. "
"16062850","16063990"," Yes, like in the city."
"16065130","16067290"," We have a lot of land that's occupied."
"16067350","16075930"," We've got a lot like our state has great offroading for motor for dirt bikers and well, let's start"
"16075930","16076310"," the baseline. "
"16076630","16077370"," This is the motor city."
"16077390","16079250"," So people love their vehicles."
"16080270","16082610"," But kids here are kind of poor, right?"
"16082850","16085710"," And so they own four wheelers and dirt bikes. "
"16085770","16087850"," And they want a place to ride their four wheelers and dirt bikes."
"16087890","16091810"," We don't really provide them with that place, which we need to and should."
"16092170","16096030"," And we have the land now with the population declined to make it happen for these kids. "
"16096690","16097890"," So they do it in the city."
"16098150","16100150"," They like ride their dirt bikes all over the city."
"16100450","16102610"," They ride their four wheelers all over the city. "
"16103610","16105170"," And they generally cause havoc."
"16106090","16111810"," But I don't think that they would if you gave them a place to ride their dirt bikes and four"
"16111810","16112650"," wheelers."
"16113050","16114330"," And some people get mad at it. "
"16114350","16116590"," And I'm like, yeah, these kids don't live out in the country."
"16116930","16121410"," I mean, if they lived out in the country, if you drive out into the country, you'll see kids riding"
"16121410","16130430"," next to highways and in the back, back dirt paths of the of the countryside and stuff like that."
"16130470","16133230"," So I'm like, the same kids are doing the same shit. "
"16133790","16135570"," They just have a place in the city to do it."
"16135570","16138470"," And I'm like, I give the key, give the kids a fucking place to run their bikes."
"16139170","16141750"," They give them like an old, old railroad line or something like that. "
"16142930","16144370"," Yeah, man."
"16144650","16150910"," And in the Netherlands, they really arrange all that crap, you know, they create these parks and"
"16150910","16155970"," recreational areas to to we have a bike culture there too, right?"
"16156370","16158090"," Bicycle culture for that stuff too, don't you?"
"16158250","16159050"," Yeah, yeah."
"16159070","16159950"," Yeah, everyone was a bike. "
"16162290","16164510"," Detroit, Detroit's like Motor City."
"16164730","16167810"," But if you go out West, the bike culture is outstanding."
"16168410","16173570"," And you like, like, I don't know how it is right now in the East Coast, like New York, Boston,"
"16174190","16176110"," New England, it was always OK. "
"16176710","16179150"," I guess Ohio's got a really big bike culture."
"16179690","16180390"," Iowa does."
"16180690","16185990"," But then when you start getting out West, it's like dedicated bike lanes, dedicated bike parks,"
"16186490","16189290"," dedicated skate parks, all that kind of stuff is there. "
"16190450","16192550"," And the kids take full advantage of those parks."
"16193910","16196450"," I wish we had more like bike parks in Detroit."
"16198490","16203230"," I think you're better off to have a bike here than a car, to be honest, say city. "
"16204090","16207410"," And then in Amsterdam, you're better off to have a bike than a car."
"16207690","16209030"," Yeah, say friends like that."
"16209030","16212890"," The only reason to have a car is if you need to travel outside of the city and the place"
"16212890","16219530"," that is not reachable by public transport or something like that, because it's it's it's it's well"
"16219530","16223090"," arranged there, you know, like the infrastructure is good. "
"16223750","16225690"," Public transport as well is good."
"16226510","16234810"," Yeah, I had no bad experience it like out West, I always had good public transportation."
"16235590","16237370"," New York had good public transportation. "
"16237530","16239290"," New York used to be a real shittle."
"16239590","16243470"," It is sometimes still, but not quite what it was like the 90s."
"16244030","16246190"," The 90s, man, it was really bad. "
"16247150","16253710"," I think California as my from my recollection, they had great cord or travel."
"16254150","16260110"," But the in the city, it was mixed bags, mixed bag on like the bark can be kind of weird"
"16260110","16262490"," to the subway in San Francisco and get kind of weird."
"16262950","16265150"," And what time of day time you're on it. "
"16269430","16270870"," And is it in Detroit?"
"16271210","16274590"," Are they because it used to be a slump, right?"
"16275210","16277110"," And is it pulling out of it at the moment?"
"16277670","16277770"," What?"
"16279070","16285190"," I'm like infrastructure wise and compared to what it was like 10 years ago."
"16285790","16286850"," Well, the country?"
"16287790","16288970"," No, Detroit."
"16289730","16291430"," No, it's booming right now. "
"16291610","16294270"," So Detroit, like burned to the depths of hell."
"16294470","16304200"," It was it was probably like the largest fall of grace without a recovery in recent memory."
"16305280","16311880"," Like so, Boston, New York, like, it's weird to speak to somebody today and they're like, LA is a"
"16311880","16317300"," shittle for San Francis shittle, New York's a shittle, Boston, whatever you want to say. "
"16317620","16320380"," But people are I'm like, how old are you?"
"16320840","16323920"," Were you alive in the 70s or the 90s?"
"16324080","16332740"," Because like those cities were shittles in like the 1970s."
"16333080","16335860"," They started to turn around in the 1980s."
"16336480","16339200"," New York was one of the last cities to turn around. "
"16339820","16342340"," I want to say they started really turning around in 92."
"16344140","16349440"," But when someone says they're a shittle, now I'm like, you have no idea how bad it actually was"
"16349440","16351040"," back then."
"16351220","16355720"," Like it doesn't hold a candle to how bad it was in those years. "
"16356940","16366620"," Now Detroit did its own thing it like Detroit had declined in the 60s from from race riots and all"
"16366620","16374100"," kinds of like job like job is being taken away from African Americans, then you had like tacit"
"16374100","16378520"," segregation where there was segregation, but everybody's getting along because of jobs and all the"
"16378520","16378800"," shit."
"16379480","16388259"," And then our country had a large societal upheaval right in the late 60s, early 70s."
"16389040","16396300"," And basically for basically abandoned Detroit and people left Detroit, not just white people, black"
"16396300","16397360"," people, everybody left Detroit. "
"16397800","16399919"," And it's like it like burned to the ground."
"16400279","16406700"," I think the bottom, if there was a bottom for Detroit, it was probably the year 2000, maybe 2000"
"16406700","16408520"," right around right around the year 2000."
"16409160","16417020"," And no other city that I can think of right now, like on that scale and size, has gone through"
"16417020","16419060"," quite that not bounced back. "
"16419240","16422040"," But Detroit is booming right now."
"16422140","16423580"," It is like booming."
"16423980","16424419"," How cool. "
"16425259","16427400"," And it's come back right now."
"16427480","16433980"," It's an awesome it's it's missing a few keep it what it's probably missing is it needs to"
"16433980","16443980"," capitalize on a second or third or fourth, like Silicon Valley alternative it needs to it was"
"16443980","16446040"," known for years as a mecca for tech."
"16446460","16449240"," So yeah, for for the auto industry. "
"16449279","16453599"," So they have been attracting some of the auto industry, electric car makers are making batteries"
"16453599","16455080"," here and development here."
"16455080","16459880"," But they need like a they need like a Tesla to come here full force or Amazon."
"16460220","16464080"," The people are going to say no to that because they fucked up like Portland and shit. "
"16464279","16472660"," But they need like some large, large tech company with manufacturing and development to move to the"
"16472660","16474599"," city and that has not happened at this point."
"16475259","16478279"," And Ford Ford fucks around with it."
"16478580","16480660"," You know, like Ford started this. "
"16481419","16486660"," They have this like innovation center of some kind for development of EV tech."
"16486660","16492500"," But from what I've heard from the engineers here in the town, it's a it's an incubator to fucking"
"16492500","16497800"," burn these companies to the ground literally to steal their tech for Ford."
"16498800","16501000"," So that this is me off to some extent. "
"16502060","16512020"," And I'd really like to see Detroit, like embrace EV technology, car making and"
"16512020","16520720"," be remain the center of American car making when we switch over to electric vehicles."
"16521860","16522660"," Yeah, I'm curious."
"16522880","16524300"," I know we'll sign up in the future. "
"16524900","16525259"," I don't know."
"16525619","16531060"," Yeah, and then we get something this is going to be, you know, but we got some climate stuff."
"16531860","16538380"," But we got some client stuff where they think that Michigan will be the next 20 years will be"
"16538380","16546800"," popular due to climate change in Texas and Florida, Louisiana, places like that. "
"16548759","16551439"," I'll try to bring up on I'll maybe try to post an article about it."
"16551700","16553619"," So there was just an article done on it last week."
"16554279","16555419"," Now, do I think that's right now?"
"16555700","16558680"," But no, but do I think my kids or grandkids could benefit from it?"
"16559080","16559340"," Probably. "
"16560700","16564279"," Yeah, that's the way that I'm going with it."
"16566590","16567570"," I was a nightmare."
"16568689","16574570"," People remember, if you're older person, you remind if you're older, if you're like 40s, 50s, and"
"16574570","16580029"," you're watching the show, those fucking cities were like on fire. "
"16580369","16583009"," No one wanted to live there Detroit is very similar to those cities."
"16583950","16589650"," If you know, you like, like, you see people today like, well, I want my like, you're like, Hey,"
"16589810","16593490"," boomer, I want my want to be able to afford where I want to be able to afford a house."
"16594330","16596369"," So you ask a young person, okay, where do you want to live?"
"16596509","16600470"," And they're like, I want to live in Santa Monica, or I want to live in New York and Manhattan"
"16600470","16606790"," with affordable rents and I'm like, well, you could have, he could have back in the 70s and 80s. "
"16606950","16609970"," But I can assure you that no one wanted to live."
"16610029","16611630"," Hey, I'll be, I'll be right back."
"16611869","16612470"," Go ahead, man, go ahead. "
"16613430","16617880"," Do you think do you think I'm gonna hang up with you?"
"16618279","16619080"," No worries, brother."
"16622300","16624060"," All right, so we're gonna end the call here."
"16625320","16628140"," Let me give it a five star right in there. "
"16629060","16645040"," We're watching price"
"16645040","16647259"," Let's get back to what some of you guys are saying in the chat."
"16647700","16652640"," So yeah, like those, those some of those cities were like really bad."
"16652820","16661119"," Like I saw my father moved us to Boston to the city of Boston in the early 1980s. "
"16661259","16667460"," And it is not the same city that it was at that time in any way, shape or form."
"16667460","16669140"," And then I went and worked in New York."
"16669840","16672840"," I did my externship for college in New York City. "
"16673140","16679619"," And New York City was just starting to become nice, quote unquote, or hipster hipster eyes are"
"16679619","16680259"," hipster fied."
"16683939","16686140"," Hookers and cocaine in every corner in the 80s."
"16692740","16694860"," I'm long here, by the way, calls if you want to know. "
"16701720","16702400"," Boulder, yeah."
"16703800","16705560"," You know, that's one thing I'll give to the West."
"16705800","16707020"," I gotta say it like so. "
"16707419","16713320"," A lot of my adult years have been living in the West and bike culture out West is fucking awesome."
"16713840","16716740"," The only place that I didn't like bike culture was California."
"16718460","16722400"," California, there's bike culture there, but it's still super dangerous. "
"16722880","16728380"," Matter of fact, I got hit by a car once riding my bike in LA got rolled off my bike"
"16728380","16729480"," at a stop sign one day."
"16745869","16748210"," I don't know who the Catholic lady is."
"16748310","16748990"," I'm not from Detroit. "
"16749349","16753570"," I'm not a I'm kind of a kind of a sycophantarian Detroit."
"16754509","16757250"," I'm not not I'm like to them."
"16757250","16758430"," I'm not liked on this. "
"16758669","16760710"," It's like, you know, it's fucked up."
"16760910","16763169"," So I was like, so last night I was reading."
"16764210","16765950"," I was reading. "
"16766630","16773669"," I was reading a story and our conservative on right."
"16774390","16778550"," And people were just making blanket statements about Dearborn, Michigan."
"16778810","16780350"," And I was like, yeah, some of that's right. "
"16780630","16782370"," But a lot of what you're saying is not right."
"16783050","16787170"," The people in person and stuff is how do you know somebody in person is completely different than"
"16787170","16793090"," than what what your real experiences are with them."
"16794750","16799510"," So right here, this is gonna kind of be my this kind of like my let's take a look at"
"16799510","16799830"," really quick. "
"16799930","16801590"," It's 229, 230 in the afternoon."
"16802850","16804010"," We will try really quick."
"16805030","16807330"," So right here, I ended up buying this up here. "
"16807430","16812390"," I think I bought this one right here, got sold down bought a little bit here, bought a bunch more"
"16812390","16812850"," right here."
"16813570","16815590"," And this kind of it, right?"
"16815810","16818350"," This is kind of like the place you don't want to be given this up down here."
"16818990","16819870"," I'm not believing. "
"16820570","16825770"," I'm not personally believing that we're done going up into the end of the week."
"16825770","16829790"," We'll look at that right now though, and see if this is a place to provide because if we do"
"16829790","16834270"," begin to reject this stuff, we do begin to reject this stuff down here."
"16834950","16838090"," We'll likely find a low into the rest of this week, right?"
"16838350","16842090"," So I don't want to see this break down below the how the hourly trigger. "
"16842110","16844850"," I don't want to see the price break down below the daily trigger."
"16845430","16848670"," I want to see price continue up into the end of the week."
"16849830","16855270"," So I don't want if we do begin to see this breakdown down here, gonna see this kind of stuff"
"16855270","16857730"," down to this kind of nonsense, I'll start getting bearish. "
"16858690","16861850"," Anything below that hourly and daily trigger."
"16864550","16868510"," And then I'll tell you what, it's right down here, you see that, I want to show you that last"
"16868510","16870010"," gap down here, you see that gap?"
"16871870","16879230"," There's a small gap right here, small gap right there, and there's a small gap right in here."
"16879950","16883210"," So two gaps, one right here, and a gap lower down there. "
"16883450","16888270"," So I don't know if you're trying to close those out or not, if they do begin to close those"
"16888270","16889870"," out, I'll start getting bearish with you."
"16900840","16903200"," Yeah, no worries, David, I just ended the call, man."
"16903760","16904640"," It's no big deal, brother. "
"16904900","16905640"," It was nice having you on."
"16905760","16907140"," We'll keep having you on here in the show."
"16912290","16916910"," I don't know if that would that movie take place in the early 90s, that Nick Cage movie. "
"16917730","16918830"," I watched that movie once."
"16923210","16926510"," Let's check the 30 minute chart on spoons and check that hourly."
"16929590","16932150"," Check that hourly velocity and see where it's at. "
"16934710","16938310"," Yeah, spy early velocity still not looking too pretty here."
"16938810","16942450"," I always want to see that velocity of the downside still not seeing it."
"16945770","16950190"," Even down here, you didn't catch that, even with that pullback down here, you didn't catch that"
"16950190","16951030"," fellow to the downside. "
"16952950","16957890"," So Velos telling you got more down the count, more down to go on velocity, at least the hourly"
"16957890","16958430"," velocity."
"16975870","16977770"," Vicks with a little bit of a roll over here."
"16978370","16981470"," One minute or one hour chart on HYG shows. "
"16982310","16984810"," The dip was bought in the last hour in HYG."
"16986490","16987930"," Dicks with a little bit of roll on it."
"16988250","16990670"," NDX looking very bearish here, believe it or not. "
"16992090","16994010"," NASDAQ not looking healthy at all."
"16995170","16996590"," Looking very unhealthy to the downside."
"16997850","17000830"," Tesla looking and not good, not bad, just neutral. "
"17001790","17003530"," Apple looking pretty fucking bad."
"17003770","17005810"," They've got their second roll coming up right now."
"17006270","17008810"," So NASDAQ and Apple looking very sick. "
"17009650","17011850"," Even with the roll in Vicks right now."
"17014050","17019990"," Looking pretty sickly on Apple looking pretty sickly on net NDX."
"17020910","17023410"," The HYG though showing a different way. "
"17023670","17025350"," They're telling you know, this looks like bottom."
"17026890","17028350"," 232 in the screen."
"17028410","17030810"," Let's go about, let's go over and do a weekly outlook here. "
"17031630","17032650"," Give me one quick second here."
"17032690","17035490"," We also have some earnings coming up."
"17037650","17039210"," Let's talk about earnings really quick. "
"17046870","17047650"," Let's show that."
"17047950","17048130"," Hold on."
"17050390","17051390"," What is going on here?"
"17051470","17052750"," I got some walking is going on here. "
"17052850","17053170"," Hold on here."
"17054890","17056050"," What is going on here?"
"17056050","17057030"," Come on now."
"17063190","17063950"," Nope. "
"17065030","17065470"," Yep."
"17066730","17075680"," So for Tuesday, let me close it here."
"17077460","17085540"," For Wednesday, we've got Tesla earnings, Netflix, Procter and Gamble, ASML, Alcoa, Morgan Stanley,"
"17086120","17088340"," Abbott, Lamb and US Bank Corp. "
"17089160","17091340"," So some heavy hitters coming in on Tuesday."
"17092300","17097780"," And then on Wednesday, we've got ATT, TSMC, American Airlines, Key Bank."
"17098820","17099440"," We got Nokia. "
"17100060","17100800"," What else we got there?"
"17100920","17101880"," That's pretty much the big ones."
"17101960","17106540"," We got AMEX on Comerica and Huntington on Friday."
"17106660","17110920"," So the big heavy hitters on Wednesday, expected to come in tomorrow. "
"17113620","17118060"," We'll take a look at Tesla and Netflix at the end of the day today and keep it up."
"17118360","17120800"," Keep, I'll try to how about this from today?"
"17122120","17124780"," I'll do an update into the close on Netflix and Tesla."
"17125360","17131020"," I'll do the same thing tomorrow so we can chart out what to expect next week on those as well. "
"17135930","17136370"," Yeah."
"17136370","17139950"," Oh, by the way, David, what's your handle on Twitter?"
"17142590","17145350"," David, what's your handle on Twitter's food and folly, brother?"
"17151840","17158340"," Johnny Moggs is saying that Detroit bottomed 1974 to 1990."
"17161260","17164740"," Yeah, I was trying to say that it started to turn around in 2000. "
"17164800","17166280"," Do you just agree with that, Johnny?"
"17166460","17171000"," Or do you think it started coming back before 2000 in Detroit or not?"
"17171700","17173480"," Johnny actually knows a lot about Detroit."
"17177950","17182010"," Yeah, what's your exact handle on Twitter so I can post it for people here?"
"17193080","17195100"," David, David looks like Roger Federer."
"17195180","17196500"," Yeah, did no doubt, right?"
"17199640","17203080"," Let me see. "
"17203140","17204140"," All right, all of this."
"17204340","17209720"," Well, we wait for David AMS. Let's take a look at the week here. "
"17212280","17214220"," All right, so right here."
"17219000","17221620"," That big fat boy second one a second here."
"17230750","17232250"," 15 minute let's extend that up. "
"17235030","17236930"," That's that grind higher, right?"
"17240450","17246070"," That's that expectation that we trade up into Friday and tag that 440."
"17247510","17249450"," We also have that 451."
"17251350","17253830"," Here that 445 and that 451. "
"17254390","17258330"," So we've got this one up here, this big gap needs filled."
"17258810","17261230"," And then this 445 up here too."
"17261390","17262310"," So not just that 440. "
"17263350","17269450"," My thesis here is that they won't park this exactly at 440 on Friday."
"17269590","17269890"," They might."
"17270810","17276750"," But always seems to me like they'll squeeze up, take that stuff up and then come back down and park"
"17276750","17278570"," it into that 440 for that Friday. "
"17279830","17283190"," So that's what I'm kind of gunning for here is that they go even higher."
"17283410","17288250"," We still have like today's Tuesday, we got Wednesday, Thursday and Friday that could send us up"
"17288250","17288450"," there."
"17289250","17293570"," And I want to see that 451 trade up into Friday. "
"17293570","17299270"," Right now we're tracking that 440 into the close of Friday for end of month."
"17300810","17302290"," We tagged it here yesterday."
"17302290","17302970"," They sold it. "
"17303030","17303690"," We tagged it here."
"17303830","17304370"," They sold it."
"17304910","17306890"," And we're finding buyers down below. "
"17307290","17309710"," And hopefully these buyers are still here to the downside."
"17310530","17313930"," We're still above the daily and the month in the hourly trigger."
"17314210","17317530"," So the bulls are in control here to send this higher. "
"17317850","17326070"," So just into tomorrow and let's say it's Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of volatility in here."
"17326390","17326890"," Whoop."
"17327230","17327910"," Hold on here. "
"17328910","17333750"," That was the that was the post market sellers down there."
"17334450","17342450"," So just into into a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, upside target for tomorrow."
"17343050","17349250"," I'm on the as long as price stays above the hourly trigger. "
"17350330","17352890"," I still have that target right there."
"17354890","17356790"," So this is still your target."
"17359210","17362660"," Make this large here. "
"17367710","17369710"," If you want to screenshot this."
"17375490","17382470"," Now there is something to be said here that I want to keep you in tune with which is the"
"17382470","17385490"," half hour of velocity is not on both side."
"17385970","17391710"," Actually, the half hour of velocity is on the bull side and price is on the bull side. "
"17391850","17394830"," So price on bull side, half hour velocity on bull side."
"17395350","17397590"," The daily velocity is on bull side."
"17398430","17400630"," Daily Velo doesn't actually need to come down. "
"17400770","17403790"," It can stay elevated for that smooth higher."
"17404070","17408950"," There's no requirement that it goes to minus 25 minus 50, especially if we're having a rounding and"
"17408950","17409570"," daily velocity."
"17410410","17412870"," And you can see that rounding in the daily right there. "
"17413070","17420130"," So the expectation is here, we grind up minimum into 440 into Friday."
"17420130","17421930"," Now there is a possibility."
"17422830","17428130"," We could at some point still see that weakness and watch that gap get filled in the weekly here. "
"17428810","17431570"," So just be really careful of that gap down there."
"17431650","17436230"," If you're really looking for, you're really looking for like the extreme."
"17436690","17438210"," Hey, this is my chance to catch low. "
"17438850","17439970"," It is down below."
"17440170","17441210"," You can see it right here."
"17441270","17442070"," There's a gap right here. "
"17442090","17444910"," And there's a small gap over here that hasn't been filled yet."
"17445570","17453930"," Tiny little gap back here on 433, 34 or so somewhere in here is that there's a teeny teeny teeny"
"17453930","17454930"," teeny tiny gap."
"17455850","17457790"," But this gap right here has not been filled. "
"17457930","17461550"," So if you're like, Hey, Cap, I want I want to be more conservative in my dip by and that"
"17461550","17461990"," kind of stuff."
"17461990","17462870"," It's probably down there."
"17464530","17469510"," If not, we are prices above the daily in the weekly expectation is that we push higher. "
"17470490","17472170"," Let's get some zero date calls here."
"17472230","17474550"," I'm probably going to get some weeklies right now as well."
"17474670","17475670"," I'm going to add to my position. "
"17476650","17480050"," So I've got 438 for today."
"17480630","17482010"," They're worthless to like pennies."
"17482710","17485370"," I'm going to add some in the money calls for Friday. "
"17493980","17528960"," Yeah, maybe not in"
"17528960","17531220"," the now among 438 for today."
"17531840","17536520"," And I've got 440 C's for Friday for October 20."
"17539180","17546520"," I mean, you can take a snapshot of that at home and you can see the expectation here if we"
"17546520","17548320"," have a break of hold on. "
"17549980","17556780"," If we have a breakdown of price on the daily trigger, this is more exaggeration."
"17563840","17565760"," But this is where you buy the dip."
"17566600","17568220"," You do buy the dip here. "
"17568360","17571800"," This is the place to buy the dip to go up into 444 and Friday."
"17572680","17578240"," If we do begin to lose the hourly and daily though, right here, you do want to take this straight"
"17578240","17581060"," to the downside to close that downside gap."
"17583120","17586760"," So you can snap that from at home and keep this on you. "
"17590820","17593900"," You want to see some kind of like vicious downside move."
"17596240","17597540"," Maybe that helps you out."
"17603520","17605820"," All right, I'm going to get rid of this stuff. "
"17605980","17607340"," Now take your take a snip at home."
"17607420","17607980"," So you have that."
"17610460","17612940"," I am bullish here into that 444. "
"17613240","17618740"," However long that takes if it's tomorrow today, if it's up here, even I still think you have"
"17618740","17621640"," available the 445 and the 451."
"17622180","17624740"," You guys saw the gamma charts from early."
"17624740","17626340"," You saw the gamma charts from this morning. "
"17627460","17643960"," Yeah, Mr."
"17644140","17644800"," Talkin Monkey, man."
"17645020","17649700"," I remember the fog fog, the smog in LA and early 2000s."
"17649760","17650640"," I remember it was pretty bad. "
"17651080","17656880"," It was like just starting to clear up and then it was just starting to clear up what I lived"
"17656880","17660460"," in Santa Monica."
"17671580","17673560"," Oh, David, it looks like you got a fan club."
"17674780","17676580"," You got people thinking that you're hot, bro. "
"17678920","17686090"," Yeah, so Comerica opened up in April 2000."
"17688230","17690150"," When did they open up the Red Wings?"
"17690890","17694650"," Where they play that didn't open until recently, right?"
"17695390","17696370"," That was more recent."
"17697330","17699110"," Yeah, go Lions, by the way, I agree with that. "
"17706150","17708370"," He'll have a negative divergence with McClellan."
"17708810","17711530"," Oscillators and SPX on daily with any clothes down here."
"17712670","17715450"," Yeah, hillbilly, there is that aspect here, right?"
"17715590","17718070"," I was looking at that where it went inside day two, aren't we?"
"17718910","17720970"," We currently on an inside day right now, brother. "
"17722210","17725770"," In the seasonality chart kind of says that do or die here."
"17726550","17729470"," Like the moment that we die on this, we're going down."
"17730450","17731970"," Did you guys get to see that earlier?"
"17733870","17736190"," Let me bring up that seasonality chart again. "
"17742090","17743210"," Give me a second here."
"17757540","17758640"," Yeah, this season."
"17758820","17760360"," You can see this from home here. "
"17765150","17769710"," This seasonality chart, if you're watching, so I've got this grid marks here gives actually trading"
"17769710","17770090"," days."
"17772770","17773990"," This one, right?"
"17774110","17775090"," There's one right here."
"17776410","17784400"," And it kind of peeks out right there. "
"17784720","17786720"," I think that this is Friday here."
"17787560","17789200"," And you get like after Friday consolidation."
"17792900","17794120"," This is the 200. "
"17794420","17795760"," This is 201 here."
"17797180","17801000"," And then consolidation into the 213th trading day."
"17802320","17805740"," So you've got got 201 to 213. "
"17806040","17807720"," These are actual sessions."
"17809740","17811280"," Doesn't account for the weekends."
"17811920","17817160"," So we should see some kind of a role here heading into Friday. "
"17820120","17822260"," Let me see if I can switch back over here."
"17831600","17834040"," Then go back on a 15 minute here."
"17835800","17838620"," So remember these previous lows down here. "
"17838820","17838960"," Okay."
"17840140","17849160"," So seasonally, what they're saying is going to happen is we got what 13 sessions one, two, three,"
"17849520","17855120"," one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12."
"17855500","17857820"," So you guys can see all that. "
"17859620","17862700"," Seasonality is saying now seasonality can be wrong."
"17862700","17863600"," We know that right?"
"17863800","17864940"," You don't trust seasonality."
"17865060","17867440"," It's not guaranteed that we go there. "
"17867540","17873740"," But what it's saying is that we should go up into this 444 or higher, right?"
"17873840","17875040"," You get an extension of some kind."
"17875720","17882780"," You get that four four four four four four zero, or the 445 or 451 doesn't matter."
"17882780","17883920"," Somewhere up in here. "
"17884560","17892680"," And then we trade down into this previous low right here and close these gaps up."
"17893320","17895060"," And that would be your next dip by."
"17895300","17899560"," So that puts us at the end. "
"17900300","17907720"," So if we go up here into this, into this monthly OPEX, then we trade down and close this gap"
"17907720","17909260"," and retest this prior low."
"17909720","17914580"," This would be your holiday rally dip by."
"17915000","17920920"," So if you are a, if you believe in the holiday rally, this would be it for you. "
"17921880","17923540"," Let me see if I can show it to you."
"17923600","17924700"," So you guys want to snap that."
"17925100","17927680"," So kind of move up here, some kind of move down here. "
"17928120","17934040"," And then you'd have your holiday dip by for December 29th."
"17934160","17941970"," At some point into next, some point into like the seventh."
"17943910","17947490"," About the seventh of did I get that right?"
"17947650","17948230"," The seventh maybe?"
"17949270","17954630"," Into the seventh of seventh or 10th of November. "
"17959220","17964100"," Yeah, so Little Caesar's Arena opened in 2017."
"17967490","17969410"," You know, I'm not happy with Little Caesar's Arena."
"17970330","17971330"," I'll be honest with you. "
"17971390","17971810"," Don't like it."
"17972790","17975950"," I went to I got a I got some tickets."
"17978110","17980390"," I got some tickets really good. "
"17980550","17988510"," I got when I get tickets to the Red Wings games, I get like fucking like front row, fifth row,"
"17989230","17990210"," and they suck."
"17991510","17996150"," I don't like the glass and I don't like the there's some like you can't see a lot of shit"
"17996150","17996650"," down there."
"17998510","18000970"," I'm not that I'm not that much of a fan. "
"18001170","18002590"," I don't know why I don't like it."
"18002750","18003830"," I don't like this the arena."
"18003830","18009000"," I don't know why. "
"18009000","18013080"," And I like like 30 rows back on those on those seats in there."
"18021840","18027060"," Well, you've only been in LCA once."
"18027200","18027980"," Did you like it or no?"
"18030710","18032150"," Did you like it at LCA?"
"18032430","18033310"," I thought it was kind of boring. "
"18034850","18036630"," It doesn't have like doesn't have character."
"18037410","18044490"," I think that Tiger Stadium retained some of that classic baseball stadium field to it."
"18048010","18052410"," Whereas Little Caesars is like all modern, all modern, all modern. "
"18060870","18062190"," Yeah, Jimmy, I'm with you."
"18062350","18066090"," They got spy has to hold this spy needs to hold this."
"18067290","18071930"," I'm gonna go back to those 15 minutes so I can make these smaller so you can see them. "
"18072730","18074710"," Spy needs to hold right where we are right now brother."
"18075430","18078210"," You can you can kiss all that away."
"18078670","18079390"," That's 440. "
"18079870","18080910"," If we're going to trade that 440."
"18082210","18084150"," Unless they want to trade it from 431."
"18084490","18085730"," That'd be a pretty big rip, wouldn't it?"
"18088610","18091550"," Like 430 to 440 into Friday. "
"18092110","18092630"," 100 point move."
"18093270","18098710"," Maybe they're saving that for for J-POW for the J-POW speech."
"18100230","18107850"," I wanted to speak to David earlier about I wanted to speak to David earlier about or more in depth"
"18107850","18113230"," about that they know where the market's going to be before we get there. "
"18114510","18116310"," We had a long talk about that too."
"18116810","18126800"," That's pre-planned to an extent and that sounds crazy too but you only go to"
"18126800","18127120"," the suites."
"18127480","18130900"," I like the suites that are about 15 or 30 rows up. "
"18131840","18133960"," I don't like the skybox shit that's up high either."
"18134060","18135960"," I like the ones that are like they're open still."
"18137020","18139540"," I don't know what those are called but I like those seats. "
"18139880","18144640"," The ones where it's like you walk in and they get the small small table and it's open to the"
"18144640","18144860"," ice."
"18146060","18147300"," Those are good seats too."
"18147440","18152100"," I've been in those box seats too or I don't know if they're box seats but they're like a quasi "
"18152100","18152720","-sweet. "
"18165520","18167200"," Yeah, that was a long drive home for you."
"18167860","18169320"," I still like to have Tiger Stadium."
"18175420","18178600"," Tiger the Detroit FC football get soccer games. "
"18179400","18180660"," I like the big house."
"18180920","18182140"," I had a blast at the big house."
"18182320","18184280"," You really can't get a bad seat at the big house. "
"18184760","18185940"," They've got a great tailgating."
"18186060","18187920"," I like I love the University of Michigan football."
"18188860","18190280"," I like their stadium. "
"18190480","18191940"," I like the tailgating."
"18192060","18193260"," Everything associated with it."
"18193440","18194180"," I like Ann Arbor. "
"18195820","18198260"," I like the Detroit Tigers, the stadium."
"18198700","18201160"," I don't like the new arena."
"18201440","18202120"," I'm not a fan of it. "
"18202120","18203980"," It's like too too clean too."
"18205880","18207740"," There's nothing authentic about it to me."
"18207860","18208800"," It's like fake authenticity. "
"18213220","18218980"," You also have to talk about the markets not only rigged but if they're like you can kind of figure"
"18218980","18220980"," out like they pre-know where we're going."
"18222960","18228680"," You kind of could tell that with the that they were caught with their pants down with Israel and"
"18228680","18229260"," Gaza, right?"
"18229440","18230260"," They just kept fucking trading."
"18231440","18232680"," They kept trading their plan. "
"18240290","18244670"," You could be wrong but they don't you don't believe they pull the market before the major data"
"18244670","18245110"," release."
"18248740","18252200"," Tuesday is their well everyone likes to say turn around Tuesday, right?"
"18253160","18258620"," So that you accumulate on Monday for up or down and then Tuesday turns into the shaking your"
"18259300","18261820"," shaking your belief in which we were actually headed."
"18266940","18268880"," So they get all your stops on Tuesday. "
"18269660","18276580"," A simplified way of explaining that would be if we're going up or down on Monday, right?"
"18276740","18277220"," So here's Monday."
"18279180","18284560"," So if we're selling on Monday, if money becomes selling, it'll make you think that we're going up"
"18284560","18286780"," and recovering and then blast you down the rest of the week."
"18287580","18290460"," Same thing you'd accumulate by the market on Monday. "
"18291180","18293840"," Come down here and make you get really scared that we're going down."
"18294400","18296780"," Take your stops out and the market actually heads higher."
"18298260","18300980"," That's where the manipulation is on Tuesdays. "
"18330920","18333720"," Can I explain the tweets being approached by a head fund?"
"18333980","18335380"," Yeah, I was approached by a hedge fund."
"18336500","18344000"," They approached a friend of mine to ask me about possibly teeming up together."
"18344480","18350380"," So I don't want to talk too much about the details as there's no guarantee that it's going to"
"18350380","18350720"," happen. "
"18351400","18353540"," They're bloodbath in this right now in the one minute."
"18353640","18354320"," Look at this shit."
"18355920","18357060"," Panic at the disco. "
"18357300","18357860"," Look at that shit."
"18358100","18358180"," Woo!"
"18360100","18361380"," 255 trying to kick your stuff."
"18363620","18371300"," The hedge fund thing is the idea here would be that we'd we do training right now inside of our"
"18371300","18375140"," Discord and we're launching we launched the website. "
"18375520","18378000"," We're also launching a trading training program."
"18378460","18387260"," So we teach you how to trade right and we track your wins and your losses make sure that you're"
"18387260","18388760"," a winning trader and all that kind of stuff."
"18389640","18397140"," Then we have you if you want you can trade with these with this hedge fund and if you're actually"
"18397140","18402940"," any good they'll they actually will hire you believe it or not to trade with them. "
"18403340","18408420"," So I'll leave it at that because we haven't just discussed it to this point like to that point"
"18408420","18412940"," details and stuff but they did it they did approach and so we're going to try to put a meeting"
"18412940","18416940"," together with these guys and see if we can do that with them work with them."
"18431740","18433040"," Yeah I'm still long here."
"18433240","18433900"," I'm long for the weekend. "
"18434400","18435860"," I don't I'm not buying this at all."
"18436220","18437560"," I'm not buying any of this drama."
"18438640","18440500"," All this emotion that's going on. "
"18442440","18444100"," My thesis is up into the end."
"18444220","18447680"," I believe well the dealers don't want that to happen right."
"18447940","18450560"," Dealers don't want to see that 440 into the OPEX. "
"18451360","18455260"," They don't mind if you get it after the after OPEX but they don't want to see it because that"
"18455260","18459720"," large group of calls up there but it's just calling for those bad boys to get printed."
"18460640","18462020"," It's just begging for them to get printed."
"18467900","18469940"," Next day I appreciate the like button. "
"18473360","18480200"," Yeah there's gonna be like a way to you guys see it should be pretty cool so the idea here"
"18480200","18485840"," would be is that you get the tools you get the training you get if you get to a certain"
"18485840","18491300"," point where we can show that your accounts so we have people that we teach right now and they all"
"18491300","18497300"," have green accounts every single one of them every single one of them does so we can get you to"
"18497300","18502460"," be green right you can prove that you're green we do a trade log with you and you're like hey"
"18502460","18509180"," I want to be a professional we're going to send you those guys and see what they say see if"
"18509180","18514260"," they can help you out and then you can trade some other cool stuff too you can trade their money"
"18514260","18522900"," so you're not trading your own money you're not blowing your accounts up all that kind of stuff and"
"18522900","18538540"," we'll see what they say I"
"18538540","18546220"," think anybody can the one fascinating thing too is I was talking to the intermediary on Friday and"
"18546220","18554740"," you know it'd be not you wouldn't be surprised as how many people can't do it it's like only one"
"18554740","18562360"," out of every hundred people it's not that many people that can do it getting a reversal here on"
"18562360","18569760"," getting a reversal here right now on the daily pivot parked on the daily trigger right now don't"
"18569760","18579540"," want to see that break underneath that daily trigger to get pretty fucking bearish in here"
"18579540","18583860"," so I'm paying attention to this right here see if they're going to try to sell this on us if"
"18583860","18588060"," they break that daily trigger I will this will trigger stops for me so I gotta be really careful"
"18588060","18598050"," here um they are trying to blood it and whoo trying to blood"
"18598050","18606920"," it right now give me one quick second I gotta take uh I gotta I got some mis-phone calls"
"18606920","18666770"," here give me one quick second so"

"20100240","20106480"," that same fucking thing with the banks it's that thing where it's like even if they're even how"
"20106480","20112840"," about this let me rephrase i want to say about tesla i'm not completely bearish on"
"20112840","20122760"," tesla it's or friday so let's say they have a bullish"
"20122760","20128800"," report on tesla it goes up it won't hold as my point it's not going to hold whatever happens on"
"20128800","20133720"," tesla if it's positive i don't think that it holds i think it's a take the money and run uh"
"20133720","20139460"," i don't see it holding hold me to that on friday i'd like to hold me that i'm like monday"
"20139460","20147400"," i want to know on monday i want to know on monday i"
"20147400","20157220"," want to know on monday if um so if tesla's a good report right"
"20157220","20163980"," uh my thesis here is that it does not hold into monday that it would that it would be sold"
"20163980","20170920"," into um let me know if you agree or disagree with that and we'll revisit it matter of fact i've"
"20170920","20175820"," got a bunch of revisits on i wrote that let's look back at some of the picks i had last"
"20175820","20185770"," week for banks i wrote a bunch of picks let me take a look at some"
"20185770","20194510"," of them and see what i said so i so i i said i was um bullish on u and"
"20194510","20204510"," h and salvin news see here so you're ready here's u and"
"20204510","20213350"," h i said i'm bullish on u and h and salvin news uh what else did i say pnc i"
"20213350","20222210"," was bearish so let's let's let's take a look at some of my picks here i"
"20222210","20233160"," was bearish on pnc yeah they did okay u and h uh"
"20233160","20241860"," their er was won i'm not showing on this one but it's looked like salvin news on that one Wells"
"20241860","20251760"," Fargo i was bullish on oh sold the fuck out of"
"20251760","20257140"," that one right i didn't say salvin news on this one did i i just said i was bullish what"
"20257140","20267620"," did i say for uh let's see a Wells Fargo i think i charted this one out they"
"20267620","20278850"," charted this one out maybe i didn't i thought i charted Wells Fargo out but"
"20278850","20283870"," they sold up and they sold their they're out there monthly like it was nobody's business and"
"20283870","20298910"," they're making another attack for the upside right now and i"
"20298910","20311730"," was like revisiting these things and finding out what else did i look at gpm i was neutral on looks"
"20311730","20318210"," kind of neutral here too uh gpm looks neutral to me and then one nice rift of 153 and then"
"20318210","20327960"," they went flat bac i was bullish on they went up and now they're kind of like sideways"
"20327960","20336600"," they took the money and ran too and city bank i was bullish on city bank went up cranking city"
"20336600","20344800"," bank was a sexy man so not too bad pretty close to what i've expected expectations were on banks or"
"20344800","20350360"," at least the ones that have reported at this point nothing like out of the norm or i remember we're"
"20350360","20356700"," coming into those earnings and people were extremely bearish um and i think the same thing holds"
"20356700","20364860"," true for a lot of these earnings i think a lot of these earnings as we run into them because"
"20364860","20371240"," we've sold down into them i think we're going to get some surprise reports that should do well for"
"20371240","20376780"," individual tickers but maybe not the stock market it's like where the indexes don't react to this"
"20376780","20383640"," stuff and then the other aspect we talked about last week on friday was uh sell the news on any"
"20383640","20389800"," of these good reports so the end of doing is like you get two separate markets you get the index"
"20389800","20394460"," is trading where they're trading and then you get individual tickers if we're selling down into"
"20394460","20399780"," their er's that those tickers should explode to the upside but you take the money and run off them"
"20399780","20408580"," tesla's looking like that to me tesla looks like any good news you'll take the money and run off of"
"20408580","20414780"," it so if that has kind of worked itself out for all of these bank stocks except for city bank"
"20414780","20421240"," um so i think like i don't think you're like i think the idea here would be that a trader"
