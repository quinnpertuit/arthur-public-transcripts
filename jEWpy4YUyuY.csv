"101150","105430"," I'm going to be reading the support of the bank. "

"279820","286060"," At times, if I'm losing money, I will leave them on because they're already dead. "
"286480","290420"," So if I put a lot of one for 30 cents and they're worth like seven cents."
"291480","293920"," When I come into the open, that's what we do."
"294000","294640"," Just leave them on. "
"295360","297080"," Sometimes I'll reposition them."
"297280","297920"," That's just me."
"298040","298780"," I'm like, yeah, they're burned. "
"298780","304860"," And that still holds true at that same trade, right?"
"305060","305980"," It's a directional trade."
"306300","307880"," Does it go the way that you want it to go?"
"307980","309660"," If it doesn't, trade is kind of dead."
"312880","314900"," Now, as of Friday. "
"317420","318400"," I think it's out here."

"328250","330150"," As of Friday, we closed out calls."
"330790","332470"," We did some spreads in here."
"332590","338010"," We kind of figured that it would take two or three days at least to consolidate. "
"339050","343870"," And my hope was for that consolidation to take place into Wednesday at some point."
"345330","347290"," And that's what's been happening, right?"
"347510","350050"," We're consolidating, consolidating, consolidating."
"352110","355070"," And I'd really like to get some down or some vol. "
"355070","359030"," I was on the phone last night or after the close yesterday with Winky."
"360210","363770"," And he had brought up something important that we need to talk about this morning."
"365050","368590"," And that was just like a pressure relief valve. "
"368930","371090"," It says it's firmly opposed to 1848."
"371310","372270"," One trade agreement."
"376370","376910"," 1448. "
"378670","382050"," I'll see if I can reenter the trade again up here somewhere."
"382730","384090"," I'd like to see."
"384190","386130"," I would like to see here. "

"395610","397610"," I'm going to make sure that I don't get trapped in this shit."
"400950","404930"," I would like to see a bounce down here."
"404930","407210"," Four 1581 somewhere in here. "
"407670","409710"," Even if we have a further down day."
"411710","414430"," Or rejection up here, something like that."
"414730","416310"," For further down today. "
"416610","417210"," Turn around Tuesday."
"417730","421630"," Yesterday we said, can we get a turnaround Tuesday to the downside?"
"423630","426770"," And so something somewhere in here, maybe reset or something like that."
"427310","434090"," Try to get some blood, some of that panic into the minutes on Wednesday. "
"434930","438490"," We'll get rid of this too at some point this morning so you guys don't have to deal with this"
"438490","438950"," bullshit."
"439310","442670"," All this traditional chart and stuff."
"446380","448540"," Maybe we'll leave it in the background so you can see it. "
"451280","453440"," And then you have the minutes actually drop, right?"
"453680","454500"," The minutes come out there."
"454720","458860"," They actually are talking about a pause and you see some kind of a into Thursday."
"459780","463000"," Thursday we start going up again, Friday we start going up again, something like that. "
"466760","467920"," So that's what happened to me."
"468060","470740"," Like my kids are like, well my wife does the same thing."
"471780","474400"," What they do is they take a move. "
"474880","476580"," They claim they don't do that."
"476720","479080"," And then they hoard them and then they wind up underneath their beds."
"479320","479840"," That kind of stuff. "
"480840","481720"," That's what it is."
"483540","485020"," Matter of fact, I got a charge."
"485260","486880"," I just I just grabbed to give me a second here. "
"495690","498490"," Get a bunch of four 16s over here."
"498690","500110"," So we'll see what happens here in this bell."
"500350","504590"," It's like I didn't want to I didn't want to say anything on on fin to it this morning because"
"504590","505030"," I'm like. "
"505930","509010"," I'm like, man, it's like fucking bears man."
"509010","511990"," Like jinx that shit and it bounces the last five minutes."
"512630","514470"," You know, like it's never for the bulls. "
"514690","514890"," The bulls."
"515350","520590"," I guess it happens to the bulls sometimes, but I'm like, oh man, like these fucking bears are"
"520590","521510"," getting fucked so hard."
"521510","525110"," So hard lately, but you don't want to like jinx it for him. "
"525190","528830"," I'm like, they're probably they're probably fucking pacing in their bedrooms right now."
"531530","534230"," They got to be pacing in their bedrooms right now."
"534590","536310"," Is this the one where we crashed?"
"536710","538030"," I'm like, oh, here we go. "
"538770","542490"," But the conversation was happened with Winky was twofold last night."
"542730","546270"," And the first one was, you know, get let's get some pressure relief here."
"546470","551310"," Like it's never always goes straight up and it never always goes straight down, right?"
"552830","554530"," And you don't want it to always. "
"554810","557030"," We talked about those two groups of people yesterday, right?"
"557530","562470"," Talked about the group of people that you have to be careful of both of these people."
"563090","571110"," Be careful of the people that are like, it's going to zero because they're upside down, picking the"
"571110","572250"," wrong direction on the way up."
"572470","575930"," And then you've got the people that want to jump on 420 to 432 early. "
"576870","578650"," And both are like in your ears constantly."
"578650","580910"," And you're just like, man, I just chill."
"581390","582370"," You know, just chill. "
"582550","583290"," We'll get there."
"583450","583830"," Just relax."
"590960","592560"," I'm going to line this up here. "
"594580","596720"," So personally, I'd like to see that down day."
"596820","600460"," If we can get a turnaround Tuesday the downside, maybe we get a bump down here."
"600760","604160"," If we trade on the bell this morning though and trade down here. "
"604920","609920"," I am going to expect a demand to at least step in if we can trade down here to this"
"609920","610820"," 41581."
"610820","613720"," I was hoping for 416, I think."
"615240","619420"," Matter of fact, I didn't think we'd get this even this close overnight. "
"620340","626520"," My expectation was that maybe we'd get down here into this open and then sell down on the opening"
"626520","626780"," bell."
"627420","630220"," So we get a little bit of an extra right now this morning."
"633140","634220"," Good morning. "
"634220","634720"," How y'all doing?"
"637980","638740"," Husky morning."
"640260","643840"," Yeah, I got I need more water."
"644140","644920"," Like I'm dehydrated. "
"645400","650380"," We're not side last night with my wife and kids and ran around and trying to keep the kids."
"650700","653760"," Kind of like a happier."
"654100","655120"," They're not happy right now. "
"655940","658140"," And then we watched a movie last night."
"658700","661600"," Shazam and they were they were protecting kitties."
"661600","664820"," So my my children were happy with that and made their night. "
"678980","680720"," Chat disabled on YouTube."
"683540","687140"," Just tell me this chat is disabled is chat disabled for you out there."
"687240","688140"," You guys can chat on YouTube. "
"688140","688960"," It looks like."
"701000","704620"," But we're talking about when it was it's a two twofold conversation."
"704880","705320"," Okay. "
"705900","706600"," I got one more minute here."
"706680","716580"," Give me a"
"716580","719900"," second."
"719900","720980"," I got the six cents. "
"727580","731400"," So when you're talking last night, it was like a two or threefold conversation."
"731900","733840"," The first part of it was relief valve."
"735320","737060"," You know, the market needs. "
"739020","742740"," Even if it's just for a moment, you know, we were talking last night about."
"743860","749060"," Some of these fed meeting minutes meetings like give cell the minutes by the by the meeting."
"752200","757780"," And so I'm like, I'm like, we've had some fed meetings where we can blast down 70 to 100 points"
"757780","759440"," in like a day or two. "
"759880","762040"," They come right back up to where we should be."
"762560","764100"," I was like, is that what you're asking for?"
"764220","765540"," And when he's like, yeah, something like that."
"765960","771080"," Like, even if you're going to stay on trend, you just get that blast down, clear it all out and"
"771080","771920"," come back up again. "
"773140","777340"," And he made another great point last night, which was about."
"777340","781140"," The meme stocks, the meme basket stocks, they're all printing."
"781840","785820"," All the spec growth are printing, like everything is like that basket. "
"786620","789440"," Of risk, ask it assets are printing."
"790520","791740"," So we'll look at something."
"794140","796940"," Right now, or this morning, we're going to look at something. "
"797180","798060"," I'm flat, by the way."
"800340","806740"," So we'll look at something this morning and see if we can have it if we can find any correlation"
"806740","810820"," between these risk basket stocks."
"811180","816100"," And there's a fascinating story about this before pre GME. "
"817280","822080"," A lot of hedge funds and boiler rooms, stuff like that."
"822200","823360"," They didn't really give too much."
"824820","829420"," They didn't really give too much credit to the retail trader. "
"830580","836100"," And they weren't aware that retail traders were being taught how to trade on Wall Street bets of"
"836100","836560"," all places."
"837920","841280"," Wall Street bets kind of like a quiet, well, it wasn't quiet, but it wasn't."
"841800","843300"," At that point, it wasn't quiet. "
"843600","844700"," Just pre GME had grown."
"845680","852440"," But there was a cadre on Wall Street bets of traders that were trained by market professionals."
"853360","859640"," And that cadre grew and trained more retail traders how to basically how to do arbitrage. "
"861120","866920"," How to make money on bets that were like one out of a hundred, right, would work."
"867420","871200"," And some of these people knew how to do this and they passed along, passed along, blah, blah, blah."
"872680","882440"," When GME happened, there were very smart people that refused to believe that GME could blast off"
"882440","883280"," to the moon. "
"885160","889840"," And all their smart people, they were all in the meetings and these rooms going, you know, like,"
"889920","892000"," fuck these retailers, we're going to take them to the cleaners."
"893320","898340"," Well, of course, once they finally actually did figure out that they were fucked, right, this is"
"898340","899440"," when they shut GME down."
"901600","904940"," They didn't, they're not as dumb as they'd seen these people. "
"905260","911460"," So they ended up coming into GME and other stocks and they ended up fighting retail and then"
"911460","912360"," fighting each other."
"913360","920840"," And then developing straight training strategies as the example use case being Wall Street bets on"
"920840","922000"," how to capitalize."
"922380","927140"," If these retailers are making all this money, how do we capitalize and make money in this in a"
"927140","929900"," similar fashion and beat retail at the same time. "
"932040","934600"," And so they're all in there fighting with each other, right?"
"934680","939040"," It was like a war zone like professionals going after each other, not the retail and professional,"
"939320","941080"," not the retailers and that kind of stuff."
"941080","943840"," These are hedge funds going at it with each other."
"944660","949160"," And they rolled this into, I'll try to find an article this morning if I can, but there are hedge"
"949160","954440"," funds that have since then created risk baskets of meme stocks. "
"955560","961760"," So they're cycling into, we're doing rotation trades and then you see a rotation trade into these"
"961760","962360"," meme stocks."
"963540","968740"," And it's kind of fascinating because you're like, you're shorting, shorting, shorting, shorting."
"969320","973660"," And then you take that short off these meme stocks, they rip faces after you now on the underlying"
"973660","975340"," and you clean up, right?"
"975460","983240"," It's like one more money making operation for a professional to make some pretty fat cash, right?"
"983740","989940"," And then re-short again on these meme stocks, these meme baskets that they're called. "
"990260","994160"," I'll try to find an article about this, but there was people are talking about it a couple of"
"994160","996600"," things two, three years ago you could find articles on this stuff."
"997160","1003440"," Now, Winky yesterday said, hey, you know, how every time we start seeing the memes popping and I'm"
"1003440","1008020"," watching my growth picks popping, it's like all firing on the same cylinders."
"1008800","1014940"," You want to start to look at these meme baskets and see if they have, can they have legs?"
"1015300","1016200"," Is it just one rip?"
"1017080","1021580"," And usually it's not just one rip, usually it's one or it's like one, two, three, one, two, three,"
"1021700","1022020"," four, five. "
"1022740","1025540"," And they're very violent and they're very volatile, right?"
"1025760","1031240"," As they go up into that last part, but the key point that Winky was making was when we see"
"1031240","1035359"," this happen, while we're rotating, it's typically at the end of a run."
"1037460","1046099"," We also see the services PMI flash, forecast 52 spot five on the prior 53 spot six, with a range"
"1046099","1053920"," of 54 to 51 spot eight, and the composite PMI flash forecast 53 prior 53 spot four."
"1056720","1058800"," Zwicky in here this morning, I don't know if he's here right now. "
"1058840","1066820"," Get free daily points, Fibonacci and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick dot com."
"1067660","1068460"," Morning everybody."
"1069440","1076100"," So we were looking at this yesterday and we're like, yeah, you start to see all these tickers get"
"1076100","1077800"," fire like on fire, right?"
"1077960","1079700"," They're doing well, but they're not on fire. "
"1082300","1082960"," All right on."
"1083040","1083980"," So Winky is here this morning."
"1084120","1084300"," Excellent. "
"1084500","1084780"," Good job."
"1084880","1085180"," Good job."
"1087380","1089660"," So we'll do is we'll just do a base comparison. "
"1090300","1094980"," We'll just do we're going to look at this morning and we're going to try to see if we can"
"1094980","1097600"," see anything and it's fairly easy to see this stuff."
"1098880","1100780"," We're not going to try to over complicate it."
"1100780","1108940"," We're just going to see if meme stocks or spec growth, not just going up, but if they start to"
"1108940","1112760"," catch on fire, right?"
"1113540","1121160"," Like burp 3% burp 5% burp 6% burp 7% and they're kind of jagged right in"
"1121160","1122200"," that last phase. "
"1122200","1125320"," One, two, three, four, five sessions, something like that."
"1126040","1130800"," You start to compare that to the tops, let's say, in the S&P 500."
"1131980","1134820"," You can usually see a flattening in a roll coming. "
"1135560","1140800"," S&P 500 can continue to go up for just to grab these all time highs, all time highs, or"
"1140800","1145260"," even, I don't know, short term highs, I'd say I'd say maybe in a run."
"1145260","1147340"," But then you see that roll come in just after."
"1147720","1150020"," So it's like a forewarning, right?"
"1150180","1151900"," We're getting kind of topping here. "
"1157480","1158420"," Let me see this here."
"1168930","1170870"," I used to mark my chargers."
"1173990","1175450"," You know how we do it around here?"
"1176150","1177730"," My wife will go out and buy. "
"1177730","1184750"," My wife will go out and buy like, so this is how it goes in my home."
"1186290","1189350"," I'll have like one charger and I take it everywhere."
"1189870","1192570"," Remember I go and take the charger with me and never lose it, it's with me. "
"1194130","1197610"," And my wife and children will have a bunch of chargers."
"1198470","1206410"," And they slowly but surely over time lose them, break them, yank on them, hoard them, leave them in"
"1206410","1206730"," piles."
"1207770","1209590"," No, all kinds of stupid stuff, right?"
"1210090","1212710"," And I'll be just bouncing around my one little charger that I have. "
"1214410","1219050"," And they eventually run out of chargers and they steal my charger."
"1220790","1222670"," And then of course I'm like, where's my charger?"
"1222910","1223570"," I just need my charger."
"1224110","1227610"," My wife will say something like, don't worry about it, we'll just buy a bunch more. "
"1228010","1230430"," I'm like, no, no, no, I don't need a bunch of chargers, I just need my charger."
"1231950","1236190"," And they're like, no, don't worry about it honey, we'll get a bunch of chargers."
"1236190","1237710"," I'm like, I don't need a bunch of chargers. "
"1238330","1241070"," So then they'll go out and they'll buy a bunch of chargers."
"1241510","1243890"," They'll hand me like a package of chargers."
"1244450","1245550"," I'll put them in a drawer. "
"1246470","1249850"," And then over the next month they disappear, like one at a time."
"1250130","1254570"," And then we're back to know more chargers again."
"1255310","1255710"," It's a cycle. "
"1266880","1268760"," I'm telling you, it's like a sick cycle."
"1268920","1272680"," When you're a dad, it's always, I don't really harp on a bunch of stuff."
"1272680","1280520"," Like I'm not like, I'm not like the thermostat, like militant about the thermostat and that kind of"
"1280520","1280720"," stuff. "
"1281040","1282780"," But the charger one gets me."
"1284720","1286500"," Yeah, pen thieves are the same thing."
"1288380","1291020"," Like a pen, that's a perfect example. "
"1291920","1294320"," Like I'm the kind of guy, I'll use a pen until it dies."
"1294740","1297780"," Like I'll never change, like it's like just one pen."
"1301440","1303320"," Some people are like, I'll use that pen. "
"1303560","1305400"," I'll use whatever pens lying in front of me."
"1305460","1307980"," I'm like, yeah, I'll use that thing until it's broken."
"1316850","1322150"," Captain, you expect the market will go up before Memorial Day weekend. "
"1322990","1329970"," PMI data may prelim reads, manufacturing PMI flash forecast at 50 on the prior 50 spot to."
"1329970","1334870"," I think, to me, the market usually calms down and gets real quiet."
"1335030","1336370"," We trap a lot of people into that weekend. "
"1336450","1342010"," I'll speak to McCarthy told Biden there would be no clean debt limit, no raising taxes."
"1342410","1343990"," They must spend less money."
"1345490","1347850"," The two major, we got PCE this week. "
"1348110","1349050"," Look at the economic calendar."
"1349570","1351370"," You get PCE, we've got rates."
"1352410","1353330"," Manufacturing PMI flash. "
"1353570","1356250"," We're not rates, but the minutes about rates."
"1356250","1359970"," People are going to want to know what's happening or reposing or not."
"1360050","1366810"," This is PMI flash forecast 52 spot five on the prior 53 spot six with a range of 54 to"
"1366810","1373370"," 51 spot eight and the composite PMI flash forecast 53 on the prior 53 spot four. "
"1374190","1377890"," And we still have a thirst trap going on with the debt ceiling."
"1378110","1380270"," Although I feel, let me know in the chat if you think this."
"1381070","1388730"," I feel like I could be wrong in this, but I was left last night feeling like some of the"
"1388730","1389090"," pressure. "
"1389870","1391790"," Of the debt ceiling was lifted."
"1392010","1394470"," I read the statement from the president."
"1395070","1396950"," I think a default. "
"1398090","1402530"," And for at least for my side, it just feels like some kind of pressure was relieved."
"1403090","1405090"," Do you feel that pressure relief or not?"
"1405730","1407650"," I'm interested to know what you think about it."
"1421250","1422570"," Yeah, the excessive Xbox. "
"1423090","1425510"," I just did that with our children too with the phones."
"1426130","1427910"," I was like, give me your phones."
"1428190","1431370"," I'm like, just like constantly on them. "
"1431510","1433330"," I'm like, I'm taking a phone away for a couple hours."
"1433570","1434170"," Go do something else."
"1435650","1436090"," I did that. "
"1436250","1436530"," I did that."
"1436650","1437670"," I think two or three days ago."
"1438370","1439490"," They didn't like that. "
"1444540","1446600"," Yeah, did you get the last aggressive tone?"
"1446860","1447480"," I felt like that."
"1447580","1449940"," I felt like the there was some pressure relief."
"1451480","1452620"," On the debt ceiling. "
"1456680","1458840"," I don't order a charge to get per month."
"1459180","1459820"," I have a son."
"1462920","1469060"," So we are on a bear. "
"1469780","1471200"," A bear plane here."
"1471380","1475280"," Don't want to see what the reaction is above here at this early trigger."
"1475940","1479520"," We'll see if we get a rejection or if we continue higher once again here. "
"1498680","1503380"," McCarthy asks Republican lawmakers to hang with me on the debt limit."
"1504060","1507740"," I told Biden there would be no clean debt limit."
"1508380","1510980"," No raising taxes must spend less money. "
"1511660","1514240"," He also said McCarthy to Republican lawmakers."
"1514540","1516640"," We are nowhere near a debt ceiling deal yet."
"1517460","1520940"," So even with my even with the seems like the pressure is being relieved. "
"1520940","1522580"," They're trying to add it back again."
"1524000","1524940"," Into the conversation."
"1524940","1526860"," I was from the punch bowl this morning. "
"1539050","1544710"," Republican negotiator says U.S. debt ceiling talks resume at 11 a.m. I think they get this done"
"1544710","1545870"," before Memorial Day."
"1548390","1551550"," I think they're all going to go home to their respective districts."
"1552350","1553030"," Give a speech. "
"1554350","1555210"," One minute remaining."
"1555650","1558690"," I'll be leading with the U.S. S&P manufacturing PMI flash."
"1560770","1562110"," I think they get it done. "
"1562230","1563130"," I think they get they get it done."
"1563150","1563630"," They go home."
"1563630","1564390"," They go on vacation. "
"1567190","1569830"," And they tell their constituents that they won."
"1571810","1573410"," That's what I think that's that's probable."
"1588810","1590210"," Right up in here. "
"1601200","1601940"," Ten seconds."
"1612220","1613480"," Forty eight spot five."
"1613720","1614580"," Forty eight spot five. "
"1614580","1617440"," Lower than forecast of 50 services PMI flash."
"1617740","1618620"," Fifty five spot one."
"1618800","1619700"," Fifty five spot one. "
"1620000","1622260"," Higher than the forecast of fifty two spot five."
"1622600","1625160"," With the composite PMI flash at fifty four spot five."
"1625320","1626620"," Fifty four spot five. "
"1627160","1629160"," That is higher than the forecast of a fifty three."
"1629620","1632540"," So we get to the markets a slight upside in the S&P 500."
"1635040","1636320"," Yeah, it's like the old movies. "
"1636520","1639980"," Red wire is cut up minus two set with like less than two seconds left."
"1639980","1640360"," To go."
"1640860","1641980"," The bomb doesn't explode. "
"1642180","1642860"," Humanity is saved."
"1659950","1660730"," That's good to see."
"1663030","1669170"," A little bit of a pub baby. "
"1670510","1674670"," So seeing a correction from the source from this Republican negotiator."
"1674670","1680490"," U.S. debt ceiling talks are to resume today, but not at eleven a.m. Eastern time as previously"
"1680490","1681270"," reported."
"1681630","1683210"," No correction from the wires. "
"1684670","1688610"," Not at eleven a.m. At the time wrong yesterday, two to nine."
"1688710","1689550"," Then they say five thirty."
"1690270","1691450"," Then change it to seven. "
"1694820","1696840"," See if you can catch that bounce right over here."
"1697460","1699160"," Try to see if bears can get a rejection."
"1699560","1700520"," Bears really want to see this. "
"1701020","1702120"," You get the hourly trigger above."
"1703100","1704080"," Five minute trigger right here."
"1704960","1707300"," See if the bears can get more down today. "
"1710320","1711200"," They can't."
"1711480","1731480"," We'll go right back to where we're doing"
"1731480","1731480"," before."
"1731480","1733740"," Hopefully you took the money and ran this morning. "
"1736980","1739760"," So looking through this S&P PMI report here."
"1739980","1745680"," So the total new orders rose for the third months of running in May with the rate of increase are"
"1745680","1747860"," quickening to the steepest for a year."
"1748560","1754620"," Also at the same time, the total new or new export orders decreased further, thereby extending the"
"1754620","1757120"," current sequence of decline to twelve months. "
"1757640","1761840"," Moreover, the rate of contraction was the quickest this year so far."
"1762280","1767400"," And despite a renewed expansion in the service sector, new business from abroad as well."
"1769140","1773900"," So seeing some comments from BlackRock's RIDAS says the Fed is likely to pause at the June meeting. "
"1775380","1776680"," I'm on that train too."
"1778080","1779840"," You might get twenty five VPS."
"1780120","1780780"," Ticks right. "
"1781100","1781820"," Ticks right."
"1781960","1784220"," Even even if they do give a rate increase."
"1785800","1787380"," Get a free trial. "
"1787380","1792840"," So in my view, even if you do get a rate increase, I think it's mild."
"1793180","1795100"," It's twenty five VPS at most."
"1795360","1798800"," Firming itself in expansion at fifty five spot one. "
"1802440","1807660"," I think coming down the road, last night I was having a conversation with Winky, another"
"1807660","1808780"," conversation with Winky."
"1810380","1813920"," And it's centered around commercial real estate."
"1815840","1816680"," Regional banks. "
"1818540","1820820"," We you know how well show you guys."
"1822120","1824560"," The business cycle in the stock market."
"1827120","1830340"," And how there's a mini cycle going on right now. "
"1830540","1831880"," No one likes to talk about this."
"1832040","1832500"," Everybody's like."
"1833140","1836380"," If you look at two thousand and two thousand eight and and then they have one of the traditional"
"1836380","1836380"," ones. "
"1836380","1837660"," And this include COVID."
"1838380","1843060"," There's like a there's like an asterisk everyone's thesis, right?"
"1843460","1847220"," You ever see a thesis out here and they're like, he looked at this but not COVID."
"1850260","1852260"," They want the COVID down. "
"1853100","1856820"," But they don't want to include COVID in their argument, right."
"1858440","1860500"," and to prove their thesis."
"1862880","1864480"," No one wants to admit that, right?"
"1864700","1868880"," No one wants to, that's where the fly is in the ointment. "
"1869300","1878480"," We've created this mini business cycle in our stock market and we're artificially trying to stop"
"1878480","1880100"," that business cycle down."
"1880840","1882520"," It's a hard thing to do, it takes time."
"1883520","1887800"," But even so, you're seeing a mini business cycle inside of our stock market. "
"1888580","1898540"," And as we were coming out of financials, and you saw the hit that was taken in"
"1898540","1904940"," the regional banks, there's like two or three different people here, right?"
"1905060","1905820"," A groups of people."
"1908020","1911600"," And there's like a trimming and there's been a trimming, right?"
"1911760","1915060"," They came in in 2020 and they took out all spec growth, right?"
"1915200","1916800"," Just like cut the legs out."
"1918500","1920840"," So we're now 10 minutes away from the top of the hour. "
"1921100","1925300"," What do you get the US new home sales units number for the month of April?"
"1926100","1930340"," They've gotten sector by sector and cleaned house, right?"
"1930340","1938360"," 0.665 million on the prior 0.683 million with a range of 0.071 to 0.645 million expected."
"1939000","1944840"," US new home sales change month over month forecast is minus two spot six percent on the prior nine"
"1944840","1950740"," spot six percent and the Richmond Fed Composite Index forecast minus eight on the prior of minus"
"1950740","1951120"," 10."
"1951540","1952420"," Morning, how are you?"
"1953560","1959160"," And so inside of this, this mini business cycle that we're in, we look at that, you know, we look"
"1959160","1961960"," at that calendar and I go, yeah, look at that, financials. "
"1962860","1966480"," And they had shorted regional banks like two or three months ago."
"1967180","1968520"," We got that final down move."
"1969540","1976860"," And then one of the next ones that are is expected where we'll have an issue is in real estate. "
"1979480","1985220"," And it looks specifically, and if you're looking around and you're like, well, is it housing?"
"1985220","1989240"," That's going to go down or is it commercial real estate?"
"1990040","1990920"," That's going to take a hit."
"1991120","1995360"," So if you're looking at all the financials, they went after regional banks, right?"
"1995740","1996400"," The VC money."
"1998300","2007960"," If you look at real estate in general, and if there was a CEO or a company involved in real"
"2007960","2012940"," estate, it would love a handout and a bailout to consolidation. "
"2016460","2017580"," Where would that be?"
"2018460","2020720"," It's probably commercial real estate."
"2024490","2026850"," High likelihood, it's commercial real estate."
"2027110","2028990"," And that don't mean like I own a strip mall. "
"2029850","2034510"," I mean, like, I own a bunch of office spaces and in these buildings, right?"
"2034810","2040410"," With, you know, I don't know, thousands of workers in them that are unoccupied still today."
"2043890","2048090"," Or, you know, and they didn't get payments from some of these companies, right?"
"2048210","2051510"," Or these companies took loans to make these payments while people worked from home."
"2052429","2054489"," There's an idea out there that everyone's returned to the office. "
"2054790","2055449"," That's not true."
"2056230","2064909"," A lot of people have not returned to the saw."
"2065929","2070770"," I want to say this was two years ago, maybe three years, zero, two, three years ago. "
"2071010","2072010"," Well, let's start before that."
"2073250","2078210"," So banks used to be involved in the stock market, but not with the kind of risk that they are"
"2078210","2080710"," today, like active market participants."
"2081370","2084030"," They weren't like that a long time ago, decades ago. "
"2084989","2087630"," Banks weren't involved in the stock market like they are today."
"2087770","2091030"," The aggressiveness that they have in the market today."
"2091290","2092670"," And that has evolved over the years. "
"2093530","2100670"," These are like institutional banks, but always trying to chase yield."
"2101950","2105870"," They became more active in our markets, right?"
"2107090","2110210"," So as decades pass, they need more yield."
"2111070","2112650"," We need to make more money. "
"2114390","2117510"," And when we let, I'm going to try to find some, I got some bunch of stuff to show you"
"2117510","2117690"," guys."
"2117910","2120170"," I was talking a week last night about this because I already read this shit."
"2120810","2127710"," So a bunch of white papers came out a couple of years ago and they were discussing how leading into"
"2127710","2137590"," the 0708 crash, we had a housing shortage for rentals, residential rentals, right?"
"2137790","2141230"," So in base case, we had a housing shortage for residential rentals. "
"2142230","2148370"," When we rolled into 0708, we washed out the system with people with bad debt."
"2149570","2156490"," We created a whole nother class of people that were added into the roles of needing rentals."
"2157250","2158490"," We're not going to give you another mortgage. "
"2159230","2160210"," You're going to become a renter."
"2161190","2163070"," And we were, I forget what the exact numbers are."
"2163130","2164790"," I'll get the numbers for you this morning. "
"2166110","2172210"," Let's say we were, let's say we were short, 15% housing stock was somewhere in there."
"2172870","2179350"," In 07, we added like another 10% to that shortage of housing stock for renters."
"2180170","2180610"," It climbed. "
"2180870","2182810"," It went to like 25 or 30%."
"2182810","2184930"," You couldn't build rentals."
"2185950","2191450"," And with the growth and population over time, we weren't going to catch up building rentals for"
"2191450","2194190"," people even into this past cycle here. "
"2195570","2202690"," And over the past, or since 08, right, past decade is past, we've never quite caught up to needing"
"2202690","2203070"," rentals."
"2204490","2208050"," We already know that we're creating a class of people that don't own anything."
"2209470","2216070"," And you watched past few years, these banks, these same banks that need to chase yield, sink their"
"2216070","2228850"," hands, their teeth into residential rentals, building new properties, buying"
"2228850","2232850"," up zero spot, seven, one to zero spot, six, four, five million expected. "
"2233410","2239790"," US new home sales change month over month forecast, minus two spot, six percent, on the prior nine"
"2239790","2245950"," spot, six percent, and the Richmond Fed Composite Index, forecast, minus eight, prior, minus 10."
"2248150","2254570"," Some of the real estate groups, I mean, there was a moment where demand waned for wholesale"
"2254570","2255190"," properties."
"2256730","2257150"," Demand waned. "
"2257290","2258510"," We're in these, we're having these groups, right?"
"2258650","2261890"," We all chatting these groups, people come and go, they're like, hey, I'm looking for these"
"2261890","2263630"," properties, I'm looking to sell these properties."
"2264830","2268030"," And you would just see properties like moving hands regularly."
"2268390","2270370"," And then there was a dirt like just quiet. "
"2271090","2273530"," No one wanted these wholesale properties anymore."
"2277050","2282210"," Then for like two or three months, anyone listing a property in these groups, they started getting"
"2282210","2283590"," snapped up again quietly."
"2284470","2286770"," Someone would put a post up and say, I've got 10 properties I want to get rid of. "
"2286970","2287970"," People were panicky, right?"
"2288210","2288450"," Scared."
"2288910","2289910"," This past few years."
"2290570","2292930"," And all of a sudden they're boom gone, boom gone, boom gone. "
"2293430","2295390"," It was all quiet."
"2296850","2299410"," Whoever these buyers were, money wasn't an issue."
"2300890","2303950"," And it wasn't even negotiation, just give them to me. "
"2304310","2307850"," And what they, it was like the BlackRock type cup type companies that were coming into these groups"
"2307850","2309230"," and just scooping up these properties."
"2310990","2313570"," They literally list these properties, right?"
"2313930","2314590"," They buy these properties."
"2314870","2315490"," They're shitholes. "
"2316490","2318530"," They're like low income housing."
"2319030","2324070"," No, not for not for section eight, but like swap a thousand bucks on it."
"2325030","2330670"," Literally put a keypad on the door and a flyer with information out front. "
"2331150","2332590"," No real turn, no nothing."
"2332750","2336570"," You go to the website, you get a code, right?"
"2336950","2338670"," You punch it in, you go inside."
"2340670","2343850"," They take your information over a phone app and boom, you've got a rental. "
"2345210","2346510"," And so that, that happened."
"2347010","2347970"," And now we saw that."
"2348150","2348890"," Now that's passed. "
"2348970","2353790"," Now everybody kind of knows like BlackRock and companies like that are buying up all of these"
"2353790","2354010"," rentals."
"2354010","2356430"," They were bought, they were building rentals, right?"
"2358030","2363170"," So, Winky and I are talking last night, we're like, well, if they're going to come into the"
"2363170","2372090"," commercial, they're going to consolidate and we've been talking about this on the show for weeks"
"2372090","2372650"," now, right?"
"2373610","2378970"," And then you see Jamie Diamond come out yesterday, you know, he's like, he's like, there's still"
"2378970","2379950"," risks to some banks."
"2380590","2385530"," I'm like, I think that there's fucking risk to some of these international real estate companies. "
"2387090","2392190"," I think there's some risk to if I was a bank and I'm like, yeah, okay, we just bought a"
"2392190","2394430"," bunch of residential real estate rentals."
"2395170","2399110"," How do we sync our fingers and our teeth into being a landlord?"
"2401970","2408430"," And if the Fed is going to step in and support these regional banks, hey, you let a few of"
"2408430","2409330"," them die off, right?"
"2409450","2413070"," Or they can't be saved or can't get the debt for the right amount of money."
"2413810","2419130"," You let a few of them die, but if the Fed's going to commit in support, I was like, the"
"2419130","2427350"," simple way to explain this would be if I was your landlord and I was removed from being your"
"2427350","2433170"," landlord and you just have now Jamie Diamond's your landlord and you have the Fed at the same time"
"2433170","2435830"," telling you the tenant, don't worry about it. "
"2436810","2438330"," We're supporting your mortgage."
"2438730","2439290"," Everything is fine."
"2440110","2441010"," Well, that's your new landlord. "
"2442250","2447330"," You don't get the panic, you get a new landlord and I don't get to take your money anymore."
"2448130","2450130"," Let's think of a simplified version of this."
"2451610","2461090"," So we were discussing last night how to look for those ETFs or stocks for this summer. "
"2461830","2465390"," And this show, I've been talking about CRE for some time period now, right?"
"2465930","2472390"," And that the business cycles and what's the next cycle that they roll into just where they start to"
"2472390","2473790"," try to clean house?"
"2477030","2482230"," U.S. Republican representative, McHenry says the White House believes they can still spend more"
"2482230","2483050"," money next year."
"2484510","2488490"," Early release of the Richmond Fed Composite Index minus 15 minus 15."
"2488950","2490690"," That is lower than the forecast of minus eight. "
"2494470","2496050"," So where do they want to clean house?"
"2496430","2498050"," How do they clean house and support?"
"2499530","2501010"," How do they not create panic?"
"2502650","2509850"," We already know that in QT that the Treasury Department does not fuck with commercial real estate."
"2510470","2514810"," There's no real, there's no like, there's QT, but there's fake QT too."
"2514950","2516390"," Four, six, eight, three million. "
"2516590","2519210"," That's higher than the forecast of zero spot, six, five million."
"2519730","2524000"," But the new home sales change at four spot, one percent, four spot, one percent higher than four"
"2524000","2525680"," cost to minus two spot, six percent."
"2526280","2530340"," You know that the Fed does not want the Treasury Department, the government does not want another"
"2530340","2531100"," housing crisis. "
"2531820","2535160"," They certainly do not want another commercial real estate crisis."
"2536040","2539820"," So how do you like finesse that without creating panic?"
"2540980","2546920"," And one of my posits here is that the discussion about the pause, probably even if they're not"
"2546920","2551720"," going to tell you publicly, so they don't create a panic, is that they're waiting for this shoe to"
"2551720","2552020"," drop."
"2552880","2555880"," And that's down eight to about two percent from April last year. "
"2557600","2558780"," So you got the debt ceiling."
"2559580","2566180"," If you have a commercial real estate crisis that unfolds, well, maybe you, maybe you wait, right?"
"2569800","2575820"," While we do some corporate rating, are you noticing that corporate rating going on out there?"
"2576040","2580300"," Do you guys see like the gecko stuff that's going on right before your eyes?"
"2580900","2581980"," We'll take this one."
"2582000","2582860"," We don't want that one. "
"2582980","2583600"," We'll take this one."
"2583680","2584540"," We don't want that one."
"2584820","2588440"," We have posted out the US new home sales April reports on the feed for those interested. "
"2590200","2592360"," Now the XL, an XLE trade is ending."
"2595140","2596480"," I didn't say Alexa."
"2596800","2598440"," I said XLE quite down Alexa. "
"2600540","2608250"," So looking to the prior revisions here, US new home sales prior was revised down."
"2608250","2610750"," Ooh, I see that XLE right now, brother."
"2611090","2617350"," From 0.68 to 3 million, the change revised down to 4% from at 9.0 to 6%. "
"2618350","2620110"," XLE, baby, reverse and course."
"2621190","2625290"," XLE trading up to its hourly trigger right now, it's daily trigger at 80, 83."
"2630790","2635970"," And then you have this whole another conversation. "
"2636670","2638510"," They still say this is part of this conversation."
"2639970","2644910"," It's that you've got you've got people out there that are like, you know, like let's sell this"
"2644910","2646130"," company down even more."
"2646290","2649770"," Like you've got retailers that are like, I'm short regional banks. "
"2650710","2655010"," And Winky's like, I didn't know what any of these regional banks were."
"2655270","2656410"," I didn't know about KRE."
"2656710","2657650"," How do these people know about?"
"2657770","2658470"," They don't, of course. "
"2658990","2660830"," They're just like jumping on the last part."
"2661870","2665850"," Trying to short the last bit of KRE on those companies."
"2666730","2668650"," Where you're kind of missing the boat, right?"
"2672670","2673750"," You're kind of missing the boat. "
"2673910","2676330"," You're kind of like the last guy in trying to short these things."
"2676830","2679030"," And then you see, and then these are like sellers, right?"
"2679190","2679870"," These are retail sellers."
"2680890","2683010"," Then you see your retail seller, King. "
"2683910","2685390"," Mike Barry, he's like, oh, I'm buying."
"2686730","2688070"," He's like, I'm buying down here."
"2688150","2694270"," And I'm like, so you're like trying to parse between like, there's a bunch of stuff. "
"2694390","2697430"," You're trying to like, sell before everybody's selling."
"2698090","2700910"," And then you're trying to buy while everybody's selling the end of it."
"2700930","2701510"," I'm speaking of McCarthy. "
"2701910","2705270"," Show the video of Biden and Shima repeatedly saying they won't negotiate."
"2708130","2710550"," Yeah, just not SBB and FRC."
"2711110","2712610"," Let me restate that then. "
"2712790","2715430"," You knew about KRE, but not SBB or FRC."
"2719030","2724630"," So it's like, is there one more leg down for these smaller ETFs in real estate?"
"2724630","2731810"," Maybe not XLRE, but there's some other ones that are commercial ETFs, commercial real estate ETFs,"
"2731870","2735210"," international commercial companies, right?"
"2735410","2740570"," That might get that last little cut on them, depending into summer and fall."
"2741810","2747390"," And maybe you'll see some of these corporate raiders wanting to jump in and be your new landlord. "
"2765260","2766920"," So let me know what you think about that."
"2766920","2770820"," Do you think that that is, do you have any thoughts on commercial real estate?"
"2771600","2773840"," Are we done with commercial real estate going down?"
"2774520","2776680"," Is XLRE guts finished going down?"
"2776880","2779780"," Are the smaller commercial real estate ETFs?"
"2780140","2781220"," Are they done going down or not?"
"2781400","2782340"," I'd like to know from you guys."
"2782500","2783680"," Any of you have any ideas on that?"
"2784320","2785040"," Let me know in the chat. "
"2786140","2792700"," Are you interested in picking up those companies if they get sold down to the depths of hell?"
"2798230","2799850"," Yeah, I saw the copper dump this morning."
"2811050","2819730"," If you want to pick the XLRE trade up again, it is only above $80.87 with a, if you"
"2819730","2827990"," re-enter XLRE, excuse me, above $80.87 on a retest on that same number."
"2828130","2837270"," So we break above $80.87, we break above, successfully retest $80.87. Your next target above is"
"2837270","2838610"," going to be $83. "
"2840550","2848000"," So we have posted out the live video of the House Republicans' news conference on the feed for"
"2848000","2848480"," those interested."
"2853370","2855430"," And we'll get a Tesla for you."
"2871020","2873680"," Can't wait to repost that Tesla trade. "
"2877880","2878660"," Can't wait."
"2880180","2882680"," Can't wait to repost that Tesla trade."
"2883180","2885900"," I try to post things on Fintuit before they happen. "
"2886680","2889840"," Not a lot of people, some people get it, some people don't."
"2891100","2892860"," Some people are getting wiser."
"2893880","2897340"," They're like, yeah, he always, I never post the shit after. "
"2897460","2898020"," It's always before."
"2901580","2904500"," Some people get it, some people have never caught on."
"2907720","2909820"," I'm not like one of those like after guys. "
"2909820","2912760"," I'm always like, yeah, I'll post this before while everybody's screaming at me."
"2920280","2925720"," Tesla, this is what you want to see down here."
"2927480","2930920"," You want to see like this daily and max bearishness. "
"2932440","2936060"," You want to see some kind of recovery on the weekly."
"2937180","2939260"," Max bearishness though, still negative."
"2940440","2943740"," You want to see the quarterly kind in the depths of hell. "
"2946840","2950320"," You want to see the bounce down here, 152, we got it."
"2951220","2959460"," I saw the rip higher, successful move up, fighting, fighting, not in immediate sell, right?"
"2961320","2962680"," Situation good, right?"
"2964760","2968600"," Wasn't like we triggered immediately and started reversing on the daily, did we?"
"2969040","2970200"," Boom down, something like that."
"2970360","2971220"," We didn't get that over here. "
"2972380","2974440"," Ripped faces off, traded 180."
"2974840","2976900"," Four and changed, 186, excuse me."
"2978380","2979920"," And what are we looking for here?"
"2980020","2980960"," We talked about this yesterday. "
"2982780","2985220"," We talked about it yesterday, we talked about the day before, right?"
"2988160","2991460"," Take the money and run as we come into the weekly."
"2993400","2998880"," We can tip our wick above it, but there's risk here of reversal, right?"
"2999160","3000140"," You just take the money and run."
"3001040","3005700"," What your next thing that you're looking for is that we break above, that's bullish. "
"3006640","3014640"," We do what successfully retest the weekly and have the hourly come up and then the daily down here,"
"3015000","3016720"," right?"
"3017940","3020940"," And lend support to a trade higher."
"3022080","3024360"," So we have that right now at this moment."
"3025060","3025960"," We have it. "
"3026100","3027300"," We've got the rip faces up."
"3027720","3030180"," We have the successful retest down below."
"3030180","3039680"," The trade is to the upside as long as Tesla holds 186.87. 186 "
"3039680","3043820",".87. So far, very bullish. "
"3044120","3044420"," Looks great."
"3045520","3048300"," Price target above 216."
"3050220","3053640"," Now I bet this comes down to like 215 or 210. "
"3054800","3061180"," So as long as we keep going up here, you're looking to start shaving off as we go higher, right?"
"3064060","3066580"," So I'll actually give you a better target, a better number."
"3067000","3068720"," 185.89 right now."
"3068860","3076360"," Even if we roll over here on Tesla, as long as we stay above that 185.72, trade is still"
"3076360","3077420"," higher on Tesla. "
"3084280","3085240"," Ooh doggy."
"3086380","3088380"," Those Tesla bulls are getting all fired up."
"3088620","3091860"," How long do you think it'll take for, how long do you think it'll take before someone comes in"
"3091860","3097400"," this, in this stream and goes, we'll be at like 200 or 300 and they'll be like, do you think"
"3097400","3098260"," I can enter now cap?"
"3099860","3103380"," Because your house become a coffee arrives at the capital. "
"3103880","3104540"," Says he is not."
"3104940","3105480"," No, no, no, no."

"16808770","16814110"," an owner or they're a moderate or somehow they like to send you a DM or something There's like they"
"16814110","16823930"," get inside and then before you know they're switching you so And the one"

"16873360","16877980"," I don't think it's gonna be a lot of anybody cheap, but This that does away with a lot of"
"16877980","16878340"," the shit."

"16962560","16967540"," continuing to talk though Now i'm going to look and see what what the lowest cost is what we're"
"16967540","16971920"," going to work on in the background If we can get around it without doing it we will choose like"
"16971920","16977460"," we won't charge Uh, I didn't I didn't want to charge unless we launched a website that cost me a"
"16977460","16982460"," big a bunch of money like this stuff costing money Uh, but until it starts costing me like 10 to"
"16982460","16984200"," 15 k a month or something like that. "

"16991320","16999500"," shit This is you know, it's some crazy too is um When I didn't monetize Uh, the chat like so"
