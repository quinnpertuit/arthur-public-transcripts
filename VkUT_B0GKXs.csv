"139890","140690"," Can you guys see me on?"

"144650","148050"," Someone in the comments let me know if I'm on Twitch and YouTube this morning. "
"148650","150830"," I'm having some YouTube issues."
"155890","156730"," Just a second."

"178910","180270"," We have some stuff to go over. "
"181630","186250"," I have a ton of stuff going on in the background that I have to take care of this morning"
"186250","186710"," still."
"190630","192450"," It has to do with a lot of it."
"192450","193570"," It has to do with Twitter API. "
"199030","200350"," I think it's right there."
"202850","204150"," Copy that right there."
"205310","206690"," Post that right there. "

"239750","240570"," Good to see everybody this morning."
"240730","241250"," How's everybody doing?"
"243230","243870"," So happy. "
"244170","246190"," Welcome back for me from Memorial Day."
"247390","248650"," I've had a couple days off here."
"248790","250530"," It took Tuesday and Wednesday off. "
"250750","252090"," It took Friday off too I think as well."
"252710","256810"," Friday was planned Tuesday, Wednesday not so much Tuesday, Wednesday not planned."
"257870","258850"," I'm having some issues. "
"259070","263890"," Well not issues but we're trying to get trying to be able to do a remote desktop."
"264890","269890"," And I'm also having some technical issues in the background with stream labs right now."
"270330","272430"," I don't know exactly why that is. "
"274190","276050"," Part of it has to do with windows."
"277410","279430"," So I'm going to go into that for you."
"280830","282570"," Part has to do with windows. "
"283450","286090"," They're like resetting or updating."
"286570","288650"," I have it set so it doesn't turn off though."
"289450","291750"," My computer set up and it does it anyways. "
"292330","297130"," And then I heard that on Friday I was sold on Friday that I didn't press the auto button."
"297610","299110"," So this is an auto button right here."
"299290","302810"," This would actually track the price of smile day long. "
"303730","304950"," If I'm not here."
"306090","309490"," So the mark went straight up into Friday close."
"311730","314630"," And the chart was all jacked up. "
"314850","319050"," So as we work this stuff out so you can have a stream every day."
"319130","323710"," I want to make sure that technically at least we're able to do this."
"324150","330250"," There's some weird stuff with like gardens like Microsoft will allow me to do this quite well on a"
"330250","330790"," remote desktop. "
"330790","333850"," But I have to be in their garden."
"333850","335830"," It's like oh yeah you got to use everything Microsoft."
"336470","338190"," And then Google's remote desktop. "
"339070","340110"," Not so good."
"340690","342150"," It's very like bare bones."
"342450","346410"," I can't speak into a microphone because my mic sounds weird to you this morning. "
"347210","349750"," I hear like like cracking or whatever into my microphone."
"351570","355770"," Let me know if you hear like weird voice this morning."
"355770","357550"," I'm not exactly sure what's going on with that either. "
"358930","359990"," It's all good on your end."
"360130","360270"," Okay."
"360630","362550"," I'm going to have to listen to the recording later today. "
"363170","364930"," So you've got 10 seconds to the market open."
"365130","368010"," It's a couple of things you need to know coming into the market this morning."
"369390","373190"," We're going to take a look at something really quick so we can get to catch up back up speed"
"373190","373490"," here. "
"374110","374690"," 10 seconds."
"377890","380670"," Now personally what I would like to see."
"381930","384970"," If I had a choice here in this market what I would like to see. "
"384970","389450"," 49, 49 that's the Canadian S&P manufacturing PMI coming in at 49."
"391870","397250"," Is another down day where there's a few things that I want you to know which first off."
"398350","399570"," We're in a short week. "
"399990","400810"," We only have four."
"402110","404650"," Yeah this is all kind of crazy or whatever."
"404950","405110"," Okay. "
"406250","410470"," So we're in a short week here and we're in a short week like this."
"415560","417060"," We're in a short week like this."
"417160","419280"," We tend to get outsized moves. "
"419280","421540"," We get a lot done in a short week."
"422460","425920"," And we have a down week in general like a five day week right."
"427840","430320"," If we're down like Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. "
"431420","433040"," We have a very remember this."
"433420","435740"," We have a very high probability of having an up Thursday."
"436440","438220"," If we don't get that up Thursday. "
"439500","441840"," Friday is like 85% guaranteed."
"441840","445160"," So you're kind of looking for that turn on Thursday to start."
"446420","448680"," Depending on how much down you've received. "
"450100","450440"," For the week."
"450840","452280"," If you can't get it on that Thursday."
"452820","455080"," Certainly on Friday you're going to get a rip now. "
"456080","458160"," Heading into the closed yesterday we got the relief bounce."
"460040","464560"," So I still want us to have more down today."
"465820","468460"," I'm going to explain to you here why in just a second. "
"469940","472240"," So when you have high probability trades."
"474060","478420"," I'm looking for like yesterday I got down here to like I think it was like minus 30 or something"
"478420","479140"," minus 25."
"479740","484880"," But the sweet juice is when we get down to like Max bearish is right like minus 50. "
"486800","491560"," And you have that little bit of capitulation that last little run down."
"493020","496960"," So you can buy a dip over here or close some some shorts or whatever it is."
"496960","500880"," Same thing goes up here in the tops right you get that last push up. "
"501340","503120"," You get that last push up."
"503880","505960"," Sorry that my thing is not working right there."
"507400","511000"," It kind of signals the end of each run right you've got a one right here. "
"511460","513360"," You got one right here you got one back here."
"513900","518760"," And the same thing kind of goes on the downside right you're just looking if you can get that or"
"518760","519159"," not."
"520080","522080"," The other thing that we're looking for is where is breath. "
"523080","523660"," Where's velocity."
"524400","528000"," And then we're also looking for resetting on any kind of support."
"528700","531140"," And you can see we're not sitting any kind of support right now. "
"531860","535700"," This morning and you can see that for eighteen did not hold."
"536500","539840"," I think it was at seven thirty eight o'clock this morning something like that."
"539960","543420"," They tried to send it down below the hourly trigger. "
"543740","545820"," Now this is a nice setup right here to the upside."
"547120","550440"," If you can get a confirmation trade right you want to see that bounce."
"551080","553240"," And then you can take this trade with confidence. "
"554100","556720"," When you don't see this bounce here."
"557280","559400"," It becomes it turns into a bearish trade."
"560220","563340"," And so just even into this being a short week with four days. "
"564180","569700"," And not having that fifth day we might get that nice move lower this morning."
"570300","575880"," We can hopefully tag down here at this four thirteen ninety nine four fourteen something like that."
"577120","580280"," So just off this opening bell right on this morning. "
"580960","583760"," The preference would be that we trade down to this four fourteen."
"584340","586540"," If possible try to make this move down here."
"587640","589260"," Have a nice little bloodletting. "
"589540","591920"," Now if we can't get the full down move today."
"593120","596720"," And this is just trying to grab some kind of some kind of liquidity to go higher."
"597340","602600"," For Friday a double bottom per chance down here at four sixteen twenty four. "
"602600","606220"," You still do not want to take that trade until it proves itself."
"606560","613020"," You can see back here that there is a bear a bear plane back that formed this morning at seven"
"613020","615560"," a.m. And it was confirmed to the downside."
"616100","621460"," So you still can't take this long here unless you get some kind of consolidation to the side. "
"622000","624460"," Price gets underneath the one and five minute."
"624800","628140"," Then you can take a trade of the hourly and then take one more trade to the upside."
"628420","631560"," So outside of all that you've got no trade here as a bull. "
"632440","633260"," You had it."
"633480","634780"," You had the formings of a trade."
"634960","636520"," Well actually it was a good bull trade this morning. "
"637260","639500"," At like three o'clock this morning or something like that."
"639620","641020"," You can see the selling already beginning."
"642180","643980"," Right off this open this morning. "
"644700","646260"," So we'll look at the previous lows."
"646320","648760"," We'll tag in some some H lines this morning."
"650920","652160"," You got one right there. "
"652640","654200"," The previous low from the day before."
"658100","660720"," We'll talk about what the collapsed bears are telling you out there."
"660720","662200"," I kind of find it funny. "
"664240","666620"," Like you know we had debt sailing."
"667740","669960"," Well we had regional bank crisis."
"672040","674680"," And as soon as soon as that was gone. "
"678340","680040"," As soon as that was over."
"680840","683160"," We moved into debt sailing crisis right."
"684180","689180"," We remember all of the discussions about the debt sailing crisis right. "
"689180","692400"," We had yelling out there like those in the clown."
"693260","698360"," We had we had all kind of we had people in chat at one point not recently like three weeks"
"698360","698680"," ago."
"699420","702740"," You got people in chat asking me serious questions. "
"703040","707740"," They're saying things like saying things like what if they don't sign this bill."
"709360","714300"," You had people saying I don't know they got stuff they got to do for their party or for the"
"714300","716360"," betterment of the US or whatever it is."
"716360","718460"," We're kind of in sanity they're saying but. "
"719620","723320"," You know of course the debt ceiling has been solved at this point right."
"725260","727360"," So yeah that's that's gone right."
"727880","732680"," Now as as as of course there's always a backup plan once the debt ceiling is solved. "
"733580","734760"," We're going to get a market crash."
"736220","738660"," Right because of the because the debt ceiling is solved."
"738740","742480"," So you ask them when you're like hey why are we crashing and it's well we're going to crash if"
"742480","743960"," the debt ceiling is not fixed. "
"743960","746700"," We're going to crash if the debt ceiling is fixed."
"748940","753520"," Okay and then and then of course if the debt ceiling is going to leave us for volatility."
"754100","756060"," We need to create some more so. "
"758580","760140"," NASDAQ is topping out."
"761300","766340"," It's something we haven't seen since the 2000 crash breath looks like shit."
"767180","768280"," So that's a crash. "
"769120","773580"," Well of course you know if you don't get the actual crash it doesn't matter as long as we go"
"773580","773780"," down."
"774360","777640"," I'm happy I'll drop my smoke bomb and I'll disappear right."
"779200","785940"," But the what you're being told and sold is different than what happens mostly. "
"787200","794040"," And that's a key when you're trying to crash the S&P 500 you can just not that often."
"795360","797760"," It's more resilient than you think."
"799040","806540"," It's not the norm for the S&P 500 and it's not the norm for tech. "
"807620","811340"," I also saw people talking about this over the past couple days."
"811700","817300"," I saw people talking about well look at Apple or look at NVDA or look at Tesla."
"819020","820640"," And they're like look at Amazon. "
"822840","825680"," They're like we always tech companies."
"826100","828880"," Do you remember the crash of 2000?"
"830640","835460"," And you know if you look in the chart and it goes up and it goes down and you know"
"835460","836780"," we'll talk about that too."
"836840","839300"," We're going to talk about some some white off stuff. "
"840700","845100"," There's one key point here that these people fail."
"849650","852590"," They fail to want to say to you."
"853910","858210"," They fail every time they do not want you to know this. "
"859330","862670"," They never talk about the splits ever."
"865070","870530"," They never say to you go back and look at how many times Apple has split."
"871270","879950"," They never tell you what a never split Apple stock is now worth"
"879950","881570"," today. "
"884810","890130"," They never tell you when they're pointing out that chart going back ten or twenty years."
"890970","899130"," Had you bought Apple ten or twenty years ago and own through all these splits over all this time."
"900130","901350"," What it's actually worth. "
"902190","903530"," This is the United States."
"905090","905870"," Stank market."
"907370","909310"," No matter what you say what you think. "
"910570","914710"," It's the greatest one in the United in the world or so the United States but it's the world right."
"917270","918950"," So they never want to say that right."
"919150","924150"," They don't want you to know that if you had just invested and bought this market for the last ten"
"924150","926590"," twenty, thirty, forty, fifty years. "
"929430","933250"," That price you're looking at and they're pointing out to you is wrong."
"933670","936770"," That price is vertical."
"937570","942150"," So analysts note that U.S. natural gas are extending their losses as traders are awaiting the"
"942150","945770"," government's EIA reports that is expected to show a large vertical. "
"946070","947830"," No one's waiting for those EIA reports."
"948510","949210"," Nobody cares about the news."
"950210","951870"," You get my point here. "
"952290","954690"," So you get fed."
"957080","958210"," Something that's inaccurate."
"959990","963330"," This you get told the lies. "
"963900","970490"," Point Fibonacci and your fed by signing up at this diarrhea sandwich of bullshit."
"971250","974330"," And especially when you're talking about individual tickers."
"976610","979250"," So I mean, I mean, maybe not the S&P. "
"979450","981310"," S&P goes up, it goes down, but it goes up, right?"
"981510","982570"," It goes up over time."
"983250","985830"," If you have money, matter of fact, this year."
"987290","990010"," If you sold puts off your own, you're very wealthy today. "
"992130","998730"," So I was reading someone made a post about Tesla from the prior forty eight spot five range scene"
"998730","1001070"," at forty eight spot five to forty eight spot three."
"1001070","1006690"," And what they did was they tried to, I've seen this all week."
"1006910","1007970"," I've seen this all week. "
"1009270","1016150"," They literally said Tesla is going to three hundred, maybe even three fifty."
"1017810","1020430"," And I'm still bearish on it."
"1021850","1023230"," I'm like, what do you mean?"
"1024030","1027089"," He's like, well, it's going to go up there and it's going to hit all these high targets. "
"1027750","1029990"," But then it's coming back down for sixty five."
"1031650","1034569"," And I'm like, well, that is what the fucking stock market is."
"1035730","1036490"," You buy. "
"1039609","1041550"," In oversold, oversold condition."
"1042970","1043750"," You hold it."
"1045430","1046510"," And you manage. "
"1047650","1048530"," That position."
"1049690","1053530"," You're not handing your money over to a professional anymore, right?"
"1053770","1054910"," You're watching my show."
"1055490","1060410"," I'm assuming that you're out there managing your own money that you've made your decision. "
"1060410","1061810"," You said, you don't want to do my own thing."
"1062230","1065010"," I'm not going down to the trial office."
"1065430","1066070"," I'm not going to bank. "
"1066610","1067730"," I'm going to get my own education."
"1068430","1072530"," I'm going to take all that and run back to a financial advisor and find out if."
"1073230","1076290"," If I'm sound in my own mind, my own money. "
"1076570","1080250"," So if you are that person, guess what you do?"
"1081230","1084530"," You look for a fucking dip."
"1085610","1086670"," You buy it."
"1088450","1092510"," And you actively manage your own portfolio. "
"1095470","1103510"," So just the entire thesis of, well, if Tesla goes to three fifty, you know, you shouldn't have"
"1103510","1104290"," bought one hundred."
"1104290","1107290"," You'll get another chance to buy it at sixty five like that dude."
"1107470","1108650"," That's mind blowing. "
"1109770","1111250"," You're going to manage your own money."
"1111770","1115230"," You have to constantly and actively manage your own portfolio."
"1116290","1118330"," This is, I assure you of this. "
"1120010","1124010"," With the rise of retail, managing their own money, right?"
"1124270","1126630"," I remember I was, Corey Doctor, was talking about this this morning, right?"
"1127050","1130070"," Like the casino has been created to take all of your money in this market."
"1132150","1133570"," With the rise of retail."
"1134310","1135470"," You surely cannot. "
"1136190","1137630"," I was just having a conversation with Winky."
"1138270","1145490"," Winky was like, yeah, this market is turning to something where you have to actively manage all the"
"1145490","1145850"," time."
"1147050","1151370"," It's not, it's very rare these days that you can just go in and buy something and walk away. "
"1151870","1153670"," So we were talking about Tyson Foods, right?"
"1154850","1159150"," The other day where I was like, hey, you only buy Tyson Foods every so many years."
"1161430","1164190"," And we were actually looking at Bud, Budweiser."
"1165490","1166730"," We should look at them real quick. "
"1167950","1173330"," So we're looking at Budweiser and you're like, I'm watching the garbage news about Budweiser."
"1173330","1177730"," It's just like pure non-stop garbage about Budweiser."
"1178670","1180330"," And then you got the cacophony. "
"1180850","1186710"," You got the talking heads on Bloomberg and you got the talking heads on, I don't know, Fox and CNN"
"1186710","1187770"," and I don't care whatever."
"1188050","1191630"," Then you get the regurgitators on Twitter."
"1192710","1196590"," You know, it just was like noise and noise and noise and noise. "
"1197490","1199310"," And so then you find yourself."
"1201170","1207290"," You're the one that actually looks like a fucking clown on Twitter going, bah, bah, bah, bah."
"1207570","1214630"," And I'm reading this and I go, has any of these people talking about this?"
"1214890","1219230"," Any of them looked at a Budweiser chart, right?"
"1219470","1220590"," So you want me to take you serious?"
"1221490","1225430"," So I'm like, let's just look at Budweiser. "
"1225430","1228790"," Let's look at the Budweiser baby for the US S&P manufacturing."
"1228970","1230190"," Let's look at it on a weekly chart."
"1232930","1234710"," Right, let's just look at it. "
"1237010","1242870"," So Budweiser has been going down since September of 2016."
"1245030","1248050"," September 2016, it's like Tyson Foods."
"1249990","1252090"," This stock is like Clorox. "
"1252090","1253450"," It's like sugar."
"1253710","1254790"," It's like bread."
"1255270","1257710"," It's like, it's garbage. "
"1258590","1263870"," It's always not garbage, but it's like going down since 2016."
"1264890","1267370"," We're in 2023."
"1268230","1270710"," And you've got people on everywhere. "
"1271230","1275090"," These people you're supposed to consider as being on your side, right?"
"1275870","1276630"," And they're feeding you."
"1278350","1286310"," You just have this trend that it's like there's some fat guy sitting inside of an office somewhere,"
"1286330","1286670"," right?"
"1288170","1292690"," Some middle-aged, fat old white guy in a hedge fund."
"1293490","1295090"," And this is what's called his gravy. "
"1296610","1298310"," He trades this shit down."
"1298710","1299650"," He trades it up."
"1300230","1301450"," He trades it down. "
"1301750","1302710"," This is like years."
"1304170","1305630"," He trades it up."
"1306250","1307810"," He trades it down. "
"1308470","1310610"," He trades it up, right?"
"1310770","1311430"," And guess what he needs?"
"1312550","1315490"," He needs to go back down and guess what it doesn't do?"
"1316050","1316950"," It bounces, right?"
"1317150","1317650"," I didn't even bounce."
"1318610","1325090"," Just started coming over here and it's like, I didn't get the depths of hell that I wanted, right?"
"1325330","1327450"," So all of a sudden now it's doom and gloom."
"1327850","1333690"," All of a sudden now I'm reading on reading on social media about the collapse of Budweiser and how"
"1333690","1335450"," Mexican company is going to buy it. "
"1335850","1340690"," All this other stuff and it's all due to this news that just came out."
"1341950","1344790"," And I'm like, this has nothing to do with the price of Budweiser."
"1344850","1345390"," It never has. "
"1346450","1347590"," It never has."
"1347830","1350610"," This is like this stock that just doesn't do anything."
"1352090","1353990"," Tites and foods is the same way. "
"1355110","1356510"," It's one of those companies, right?"
"1356670","1360190"," You can look up Tites and Foods and you can make up any excuse you want."
"1361030","1363010"," I was listening into the Tites and Foods."
"1363290","1368930"," I was listening to the Tites and Foods ER report and they were like, they're like, yeah, I don't"
"1368930","1369030"," know. "
"1369150","1371090"," We're not selling pork or we're not selling beef."
"1372270","1375610"," But we started pumping out chicken tenders."
"1376230","1380710"," And we started pumping out fake tofu shit for people. "
"1381530","1383050"," And all their numbers are great, right?"
"1383290","1385810"," This is like a company that people said, I don't eat that food."
"1386450","1386870"," You do."
"1387430","1388370"," You're like kids eat it. "
"1388370","1390770"," They got the gross kids eat it."
"1391950","1395310"," They have it in every shopping center across the United States of America."
"1395630","1396470"," They're everywhere, right?"
"1396530","1401150"," The US S&P manufacturing PMI reports on the feed for anyone interested. "
"1401770","1403170"," Let's look at them for a minute."
"1403210","1407810"," A solid taste, but output supported by further decline in a backlog of work."
"1408230","1411450"," So input costs drop for the first time seen in three years as well. "
"1412150","1413310"," Tites and Foods, man."
"1413450","1416390"," This is like 2016 back here, right?"
"1416390","1417230"," Up."
"1417630","1418110"," Down. "
"1418770","1418990"," Up."
"1419490","1419830"," Down."
"1420990","1421690"," Get the picture. "
"1422070","1422090"," Up."
"1422290","1422370"," Down."
"1424270","1429150"," He states that may saw a renewed deterioration of business conditions in the US manufacturing"
"1429150","1433970"," economy, which will add to concerns about broader economic health and recession risk. "
"1435470","1440150"," I mean, maybe there's some like news like you've got people that are like, the reason why Tites and"
"1440150","1443790"," Foods is down is because, you know, they're not selling beef."
"1443790","1445610"," You know, it's like, wait a minute."
"1446330","1448490"," What is like that has been going on?"
"1448610","1451890"," This is like going on for, you know, how long a decade?"
"1455530","1456850"," So I don't know, man. "
"1456990","1459890"," Some of the stuff that I'm out there consuming."
"1461130","1463610"," You know, it's like doom and gloom down here."
"1466530","1466970"," Right?"
"1467270","1468830"," And then you get more doom up here. "
"1469010","1470450"," What do you, what do you buy in Tyson for?"
"1474430","1474950"," It's all right."
"1474970","1476210"," It's at the peak right now, bro."
"1476390","1477210"," It's already down with the stomach. "
"1477210","1477790"," Yeah, I agree."
"1477950","1479010"," I'm not buying Tyson here."
"1479470","1482010"," And we're down here and they're like, bro, what are you doing?"
"1482010","1482790"," Why are you buying Tyson?"
"1483110","1484170"," It's going to crash down here. "
"1484210","1485810"," And I'm like, dude, it's Tyson fucking Foods."
"1486750","1487630"," It's Tyson Foods."
"1488590","1489250"," You know what I'm saying?"
"1489470","1492750"," So and you're talking about timeframes that are insane. "
"1493610","1496230"," Like these are insane timeframes in some of these companies."
"1497170","1498330"," You make my eyes bleed."
"1498510","1501810"," I don't even like buying them. "
"1503810","1510690"," But I'm like, yeah, if it arises every, if it arises every, I don't know, three years, five years"
"1510690","1511270"," or something."
"1511550","1515870"," Yeah, maybe I'll buy it and throw it to sell some OTM puts on it for the next five years."
"1521720","1526020"," So think about some of the things that you're consuming out there is my point. "
"1526900","1529460"," Think about like just basic ideas."
"1530060","1531660"," Like we're not talking rocket science here."
"1531660","1535720"," We're not talking like we're going to do this and we're going to look at that. "
"1536000","1539960"," We're going to find the worst thing about where we're at with this or that."
"1540240","1544760"," Like if you look at this and if you look at that, it's always like trying to find something."
"1545700","1550140"," When you can just look at a company and go, well, that shit's been going down since 2016. "
"1550620","1551200"," Like Budweiser."
"1552020","1554700"," Like following this trend for 10 years."
"1556820","1562380"," So the Bank of England sells 770 million pounds of bonds in an auction receiving one spot, zero or"
"1562380","1563620"," four billion pounds in bids. "
"1564200","1567560"," They state the APF Guild sale operation coverage here was one to 35."
"1568680","1573360"," When you think about when you think about Apple going back to Apple."
"1574180","1576440"," And you have people say things like, you know, like. "
"1577240","1578360"," It's as high as ever."
"1578500","1579020"," That's the worst ever."
"1579140","1580100"," I'm like, well, what does it share?"
"1580640","1581680"," I don't even remember anymore. "
"1581820","1584040"," It's probably like, I think it's probably like third 26,000."
"1584040","1589560"," Or it was last summer, like 26,000 to share or something like that."
"1589680","1592540"," Do you get the US ISM manufacturing PMI now?"
"1592820","1594980"," This data here again for the month of May. "
"1595680","1602140"," Forecast of 47 on the prior 47 spot one with a range of 48 spot five to 45 spot five"
"1602140","1608000"," was good US construction spending month over month forecast zero spot, two percent prior zero spot,"
"1608080","1610180"," three percent and the ISMs breakdown."
"1610180","1616660"," So the manufacturing price is paid forecast of 52 spot three on the prior 53 spot two, the"
"1616660","1620680"," employment index, sorry, prior of 50 spot two and the new orders index."
"1621140","1622820"," So a prior of 45 spot seven. "

"1644320","1648760"," These are the same people that told you not to buy three sixty five, right?"
"1649680","1657060"," This one person was like, you're going to get your chance to buy Tesla at sixty five."
"1657060","1661020"," And I was like, why didn't you just buy it at a hundred and then come back and buy it"
"1661020","1661700"," at sixty five?"
"1663040","1665900"," What if it doesn't come back to sixty five?"
"1667440","1675040"," If we're in an oversold condition on a daily or a weekly, you should step in and buy that stuff."
"1675240","1677620"," It's important that you have your participant in this market. "
"1678260","1683480"," Why are you telling a, why are you telling an investor not to buy at one hundred to wait for"
"1683480","1684180"," sixty five?"
"1684280","1685400"," Can you imagine doing that?"
"1687580","1691180"," You're like twenty, thirty years as if you're like, hey, I'm an investor."
"1691480","1692380"," I'm going to manage my own money."
"1693660","1697640"," You're going to wait for some guy on Twitter to tell you that it'll come back for sixty five"
"1697640","1698960"," dollars or something like that. "
"1699260","1699960"," Like pure insanity."
"1701940","1703240"," Absolute pure insanity."
"1705020","1708960"," Are you like, are you going to wait for Tesla to come back to thirty five dollars in ten years?"
"1709280","1710320"," You'll just be left behind. "
"1712860","1716740"," So when those opportunities arise, you buy."
"1717840","1718420"," I buy."
"1719340","1720880"," When we're down there, I buy. "
"1721700","1722600"," I am a bull."
"1722820","1724680"," I have enjoyed this entire year."
"1724900","1726260"," This entire year has been wonderful. "
"1726800","1729460"," It's been great going back to October, believe it or not."
"1729580","1731680"," It was great buying dips last May and June."
"1732160","1732620"," It was great. "
"1733400","1737900"," If that comes up again, where that opportunity presents itself."
"1738380","1741460"," It's like Monday of next week."
"1742220","1743420"," I'm going to buy the fuck out of it. "
"1744880","1746660"," Don't threaten me with a good time."
"1748840","1751100"," If you want to do it again in the fall."
"1751940","1753480"," Don't threaten me with a good time. "
"1754200","1757140"," If you want to do it, I don't know fucking next spring."
"1757640","1759120"," Don't threaten me with a good time."
"1759800","1760320"," I'll tell you this. "
"1761480","1765220"," If we don't go back there, which oftentimes we don't."
"1768860","1773060"," I would have been left behind and I would have nobody to blame but myself."
"1773480","1775280"," I'm not going to go back on Finn to it. "
"1775800","1779360"," Find some guy or YouTube and find some guy and be like, you know what?"
"1779520","1782840"," You told me that we were going to go back to 65 on Tesla and we never did."
"1783500","1785460"," Because the only person that loses me, right?"
"1785880","1787900"," So I have to be like, I'm going to buy 100 bucks."
"1788560","1793180"," If it goes to 65, I buy 100 shares at 100 bucks. "
"1793980","1798840"," And then I go back and buy another 100 shares at $65, let's say, right?"
"1799620","1800440"," What am I in for?"
"1800640","1801660"," Like 80 bucks or something?"
"1803060","1807560"," How long do you think when we hit 65, do you think Tesla stays at 65?"
"1808820","1809520"," A month?"
"1812060","1813480"," I could have sold puts."
"1813760","1816020"," It could have sold calls and all that underlying."
"1816860","1819680"," I could have taken profit on the $100 push higher. "
"1820780","1824920"," I could have sold out of the $100 buy-in and sell the market down."
"1825580","1826880"," Then buy again at 65."
"1827840","1829640"," There's like all kinds of options around there. "
"1831140","1834640"," So all this talk is bizarre to me."
"1835460","1839800"," The talk about like, I'm bearish on Tesla, but it's going to 300 or 350."
"1840640","1842020"," I'm like, what do you mean?"
"1842280","1843360"," You're saying we're going to 350?"
"1845100","1849880"," You're saying that the price of Tesla is going up 50% and you're bearish?"
"1851000","1855300"," I think it's stocks that don't go up 10% in the year and you're bearish on Tesla. "
"1858740","1860100"," Well, okay."
"1860700","1864900"," And further to the point, you see this market, right?"
"1865300","1866200"," This market is wild."
"1867660","1869840"," We're getting crashes every two years, right?"
"1870060","1875400"," We're getting reactions to crashes that we've never experienced with modern monetary theory, right?"
"1875960","1878120"," We're experiencing silent bear markets. "
"1878880","1884080"," We had a sound bear market in December of 2020, it started, right?"
"1885420","1890140"," We had the S&P 500 go scream higher for an entire year."
"1890700","1891160"," Unrelenting."
"1891820","1893560"," No dip left behind. "
"1893940","1896320"," We're in the entire year."
"1897160","1901160"," When I see some of these charts people are showing and they're like, well, look at that shit that"
"1901160","1902580"," went on with the .com crash."
"1903460","1905140"," I'm like, spread that thing out a little bit. "
"1906300","1910380"," Because you saw that .com crash was straight up for like a year, three years."
"1910880","1912080"," Manufacturing price is paid."
"1912080","1914900"," Yeah, we're discussing this weekend, right?"
"1915040","1917540"," 53 spot to the employment index. "
"1917780","1920920"," So a prior 50 spot to any new orders index."
"1921300","1923220"," So a prior of 45 spot seven."
"1924680","1925200"," NVDA. "
"1925600","1927260"," Yee ha doggy."
"1928180","1929440"," Let's look at NVDA."
"1934400","1935700"," That's working out, right?"
"1936080","1938560"," That's short right there from this morning for NVDA. "
"1938700","1939880"," It's working out for you, isn't it?"

"1960840","1962180"," See that book right there?"
"1968390","1974950"," In that book in chapter one, they tell you do not short that. "
"1977370","1978790"," They tell you do not."
"1979690","1982030"," You just wait until it's done."
"1984570","1986630"," Now these are legends. "
"1988050","1989390"," This isn't some guy on YouTube."
"1989930","1990330"," It's not me."
"1991570","1996470"," These are legends of Wall Street. "
"1997750","2002570"," These are the best of the best of the best."
"2004310","2011410"," These are the most well regarded market makers, trainers of all time."
"2016050","2017650"," You know what these guys tell you?"
"2018590","2020310"," Stop fucking calling tops. "
"2021690","2022830"," Stop doing it."
"2023450","2024610"," Stop trying to short it."
"2025310","2026770"," Stop trying to fuck with it. "
"2027690","2029450"," You can wait until it rolls."
"2037530","2043070"," So when you're out there saying like it's NVDA's day today, it's the wrong thing to be saying, man."
"2043090","2045350"," It's the wrong thing to be pushing the people in public. "
"2046090","2047690"," It's not the right thing to be doing."
"2050270","2053750"," If you go out there and find yourself a guy, his name is Bob Kendall."
"2056429","2057489"," You can find him on YouTube. "
"2057489","2058230"," He's on Twitter."
"2059590","2060630"," He's an old school market maker."
"2060630","2061449"," You find him. "
"2061590","2062389"," His name is Bob Kendall."
"2062770","2066850"," I'm going to go out there and find him and ask him sometime if he has time."
"2067070","2075949"," Say to him, did you ever work with US hedge funds with the yen back in the 70s?"
"2078810","2086850"," We blew up hedge fund after hedge fund after hedge fund trying to call the top in Japan. "
"2086850","2090590"," And these are like the smartest people in the United States."
"2092989","2097230"," And he'll tell you the stories about that that went on in Japan."
"2098510","2101870"," So you look at something like this right here with NVDA. "
"2102350","2104670"," And it's kind of a hard thing to be doing here."
"2105370","2107890"," Like trying to call tops, trying to call tops, trying to call tops."
"2108730","2109930"," There's no real point. "
"2111850","2113990"," There's no real point calling a top here."
"2117150","2122310"," Explain to you how viciously bullish NVDA is."
"2122630","2127890"," I don't care if it's a, I don't care if it's a, I'll lead with the U.S. manufacturing PMI. "
"2135010","2140820"," I don't care if it's like, this is like the signs of a crash."
"2141440","2142260"," I'll tell you what, man."
"2142950","2144840"," This whole ride has been awesome. "
"2145720","2146380"," Awesome."
"2147100","2147760"," Awesome."
"2148320","2148540"," Awesome. "
"2150360","2160340"," And just because you missed out on the run, nobody cares."
"2163060","2164640"," Let me just show you this."
"2165140","2168040"," You could go back and close this entire gap here. "
"2168040","2170440"," And guess what?"
"2170600","2171420"," It's still bullish."
"2172900","2173800"," Ten seconds."
"2174880","2178160"," You could go down here and close this gap and get a bounce. "
"2179320","2181680"," And it's still bullish."
"2184640","2187260"," 46 spot 9, 46 spot 9."
"2187580","2189360"," That is lower than the forecast of a 47."
"2190200","2192820"," Price is paid at 44 spot 2, 44 spot 2."
"2193320","2195140"," Lower than forecast 52 spot 3."
"2195140","2198540"," New orders index 42 spot 6, 42 spot 6."
"2198720","2201760"," Employment index 51 spot 4, 51 spot 4."
"2202040","2205580"," And U.S. construction spending at 1 spot 2%, 1 spot 2%. "
"2205580","2208440"," That is higher than the forecast of a 0 spot 2%."
"2208440","2212240"," So looking to the market, seeing a little bit of weakness in the deck, seeing some slight strength"
"2212240","2213400"," in the S&P 500."
"2214040","2215120"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"2215380","2216020"," Go as well."
"2216140","2216760"," Taking towards the upside."
"2221460","2225520"," Like you literally cannot short this. "
"2227980","2231800"," Until it like you can't even short this right here."
"2232840","2236020"," You can short the like the."
"2236600","2237980"," I need some breath. "
"2239080","2240560"," You can short that."
"2240560","2248280"," Like that's a money shot right there."
"2251340","2253700"," That's what this guy did down here. "
"2254100","2255720"," Let's look into the key findings in this."
"2255860","2256900"," This guy right here."
"2256980","2261160"," You see right there production and employment is growing. "
"2261560","2263260"," Supply deliveries are faster."
"2263920","2269340"," Raw materials, inventories is contracting and customers inventories are noted as being too high and"
"2269340","2270240"," prices are decreasing."
"2270240","2273160"," Exports unchanged, imports are contracting. "
"2274520","2276520"," The guy that bought down here."
"2277440","2280240"," This guy right here, you give a flying fuck."
"2281320","2283580"," You give a flying fuck. "
"2286460","2290980"," We could roll all the way back down here and this guy still made."
"2292040","2293120"," What, what do you make?"
"2295060","2297060"," From all the way down here, 160."
"2297840","2300060"," This dream is sponsored by all that money. "
"2300380","2301100"," Get free daily."
"2301340","2302780"," You could roll right now."
"2303060","2306600"," 420 all the way down to 340. "
"2308320","2311880"," He's still burr baby cleaned up."
"2312740","2314180"," And then that same guy."
"2315820","2317820"," If price were to roll over here. "
"2318820","2324900"," You can just sit back and do nothing and wait until there's that rejection again for the down move."
"2325580","2326640"," It's no big deal."
"2328340","2331560"," So while you're up here doing all this nonsense up here. "
"2332740","2334480"," And you're like, that's the top."
"2335940","2337260"," It's in pure insanity."
"2338800","2340480"," The parent says no need. "
"2340840","2341280"," What do you care?"
"2343300","2345480"," Whatever this thing rolls over, right?"
"2347820","2350120"," You can be there for that moment."
"2352100","2355620"," You're not even under three fifteen ninety three yet and you're calling for a crash."
"2355760","2358040"," What you call on that a crash because that's not a crash. "
"2359600","2361840"," You can go all the way back down right now."
"2361880","2363840"," We go to three three sixteen today."
"2364860","2365940"," And that's not a crash. "
"2366460","2367900"," 14 spot to nine percent."
"2370300","2372520"," So I mean, that's going to take some time."
"2372700","2376720"," It's like conversation first for the next three to six months, maybe. "
"2376720","2379260"," I haven't seen it."
"2379860","2381500"," It ain't showing it ain't nothing."
"2381680","2382960"," There's nothing here saying. "
"2383640","2383980"," Crash."
"2384980","2387220"," Just because you don't like the price of four nineteen."
"2388240","2389200"," I don't know man. "
"2389280","2390040"," It doesn't work for me."
"2390940","2392020"," That doesn't fly."
"2394780","2399560"," Just because you don't want to discuss what a pre-split price is in a ticker. "
"2400600","2401700"," Doesn't fly for me."
"2405280","2408200"," It'll remain rational longer than you're going to call that top."
"2408380","2409660"," I guess maybe once you'll be right. "
"2410820","2414640"," You can walk around with Twitter cred for a year or something like that."
"2415700","2416940"," I guess that's what you want."
"2418620","2419300"," I don't know. "
"2419400","2422680"," Maybe you got five followers and you want a hundred thousand followers or something."
"2422880","2424260"," So you can say you called it or something."
"2425280","2426020"," We're making videos. "
"2426240","2427140"," Everybody was making videos."
"2427140","2430240"," You guys are like these just one guy called this."
"2430380","2430960"," I'm like bullshit. "
"2431120","2433700"," We're making videos about the role in 2021."
"2435720","2436620"," All through the fall."
"2436800","2437120"," Get out. "
"2438440","2439580"," Get the fuck out."
"2440040","2444020"," Everybody knew 2019 before the COVID crash."
"2444860","2446520"," TLT was straight vertical with the spot. "
"2450410","2451690"," Everybody knew it was happening."
"2452090","2454810"," So we're up here doing this kind of stuff up here."
"2455450","2456990"," Whoever it is that's down here. "
"2457530","2458430"," He doesn't care."
"2458650","2460970"," He doesn't care if it rolls over a hundred points to one hundred."
"2461070","2462790"," I don't know. "
"2462970","2463890"," Yeah, almost a hundred points."
"2464150","2465250"," So you could really roll a hundred points."
"2465450","2466250"," This guy doesn't care. "
"2467170","2468990"," He caught that move down here."
"2470430","2471530"," Caught it right down here."
"2472470","2474690"," Caught that bull plane down there in a daily trigger. "
"2474910","2475870"," He wrote it up like it was nothing."
"2476470","2478150"," How's that spy doing right now?"
"2479630","2482450"," Again, this is the U.S. A three day bill."
"2482650","2486470"," So these were announced yesterday, auction day today with the issue date of tomorrow. "
"2486910","2488830"," So the bits of color came in at two to thirty eight."
"2488850","2490030"," Coming back on up in here."
"2490210","2490630"," Okay. "
"2490970","2493510"," So 14 spots to nine spoons."
"2494830","2498270"," Coming back for a three trigger cluster."
"2503630","2508110"," Oh, yeah, it's it's consolidating. "
"2508110","2511830"," It ain't collapsing just yet, is it?"
"2514990","2518250"," Four eighteen four eighteen forty four."
"2522190","2523310"," Right there."
"2526700","2529560"," Need that spoons to get back up here. "
"2530740","2536200"," Start getting saucy with it so it can get all crazy for a move higher."
"2537260","2543140"," Get all hot and spicy and butter, butter, butter and all that kind of hot sauce."
"2548760","2551040"," So there's some rules here. "
"2554840","2558060"," First rule is going to be stop calling a fucking top."
"2558380","2560020"," Okay, seriously, just stop."
"2562100","2570940"," Go read a book. "
"2572600","2575660"," You all go up there and buy yourselves whatever it is you buy yourself."
"2575860","2578700"," Go spend a dollar on an audio book and just listen to it."
"2578740","2579300"," Okay, please. "
"2579560","2580380"," I love a peep."
"2582520","2587500"," You'll find yourself Bob Kendall asking about trying to try to shirt the Japanese market back in"
"2587500","2588200"," the seventies."
"2589140","2593040"," That's the old guy who's like, oh, yeah, we blew up a few hedge funds in the U.S. for"
"2593040","2594780"," a decade, a decade. "
"2610900","2614060"," So, how's that Disney doing this morning, Winky?"
"2617400","2619060"," How's that Disney doing?"
"2626840","2631400"," Winky and I were tired about Disney and then I was like, oh man, I'm watching me some Disney this"
"2631400","2631760"," morning."
"2632880","2640120"," Disney trading 87.56. Is it going to do it?"
"2640240","2640620"," I don't know."
"2642480","2644380"," 87.56 right now. "
"2645500","2647300"," Like all eyes on Disney."
"2648340","2650200"," Is Disney going to zero?"
"2656940","2660800"," The three trigger cluster forming right now here on the spy."
"2681590","2684250"," What we're looking for here is two fold. "
"2689510","2691910"," Looking for a break above."
"2693890","2696110"," We've got this one little thingy right here."
"2696230","2697250"," We've got another one right here. "
"2698590","2700130"," We've got a couple of previous."
"2700650","2705190"," I'll start tagging a higher though, but what we want to do is we want to see price get above"
"2705190","2705510"," here."
"2706110","2712590"," Come back and recheck the hourly and confirm a trend, trend day to the upside. "
"2719980","2720780"," Right here."
"2723540","2724780"," And right here."
"2725380","2727480"," So, we're going to let this play out right now. "
"2727500","2728520"," Just keep an eye on it."
"2729400","2731860"," You want to see this blast through."
"2734240","2736160"," Come back down, hopefully. "
"2738260","2740020"," Trade this higher right here, okay?"
"2741020","2742120"," We're going to keep our eyes on it."
"2747660","2750340"," We've got some pre-market stuff going on up here."
"2751140","2753000"," We've got another scene of the crime above. "
"2753940","2754840"," We're right there."
"2755000","2756340"," There's a scene of the crime right there."
"2757960","2758980"," Gap left behind. "
"2759880","2761940"," We've got gaps from years ago to the upside."
"2763120","2765640"," We're going to also talk, and I've got a bunch of stuff I've got to do."
"2765740","2767440"," I've got me in text right now in the background. "
"2767780","2769020"," People are like, get off."
"2769020","2773340"," Stop talking on the microphone and call me right now because we get a bunch of crap we're going to"
"2773340","2773480"," do."
"2774160","2774980"," I know, I know. "
"2780940","2784000"," So, right here."
"2784160","2785360"," Let's look back here."
"2786820","2788660"," We've got this scene of the crime right there, right?"
"2789140","2790520"," Oh, doggy. "
"2790640","2791680"," We've got the big boy up there."
"2793260","2794200"," Real true scene."
"2794360","2796600"," This is this Friday scene of the crime. "
"2796600","2803460"," If we can actually get up here today, we can get up here right here, right?"
"2803860","2804560"," We can hold that."
"2804860","2807000"," I don't see why you can't get up there by Friday."
"2807400","2808420"," I don't see why not. "
"2808780","2811360"," We've got gaps above it like 424, 426."
"2813120","2814980"," As a matter of fact, we're going to look at something right now."
"2815060","2815940"," Give me one second. "
"2816120","2817160"," We're going to look at something here."
"2817960","2819380"," We're going to talk about something here."
"2820820","2822860"," Maybe I can pull it up here. "
"2834430","2835370"," Oh, yeah."
"2835470","2836350"," We're going to make this real simple."
"2837790","2840070"," We're going to upset the bears. "
"2843430","2850470"," I don't mean to, but if you're a practitioner, a valuable way of theory."
"2851590","2853190"," We're going to talk about that this morning."
"2853450","2858270"," Region Governor says that there was an unknown device that detonated in the city of Belgorod. "
"2858570","2859970"," So, again, this is in Russia here."
"2859970","2864810"," The regional governor states that an unknown device was detonated in the city of Belgorod."
"2866090","2869470"," I'm going to keep an eye on this for a trend day. "
"2872190","2876010"," Higher or lower low, higher low in the morning."
"2877310","2878310"," Spicy baby."
"2879590","2880170"," It's looking spicy. "
"2882590","2884310"," We don't want to enter this tour."
"2884650","2887030"," I want to enter it too early, but you shouldn't."
"2888450","2889950"," Let's look at that in a five-minute chart. "
"2891090","2891970"," Oh, baby."
"2892090","2892710"," Look at that."
"2893010","2893950"," It's like the setup. "
"2894210","2896410"," It's close by a drone according to prelimo."
"2896730","2897270"," Oh, yeah."
"2899570","2901930"," So, right over here, we get that nice little squeeze. "
"2902290","2905030"," If this can do this right here, what are we going to be looking for?"
"2909000","2910780"," Right there is what we're looking for."
"2911720","2913640"," I feel a little snapshot of that."
"2920100","2922560"," If you get that bounce right there, right?"
"2924460","2930120"," It's like a 98% guaranteed printer to the upside, like high probability. "
"2932640","2933780"," It's like hot sauce."
"2936060","2939300"," Oh, look at that squeeze going on right there."
"2939460","2939760"," Look at that. "
"2939920","2958610"," You can only imagine"
"2958610","2960350"," Bob Kettle saying, wait, who are you?"
"2960610","2961010"," I know Bob."
"2961750","2962770"," I know him personally."
"2962870","2963410"," I've talked to him. "
"2964730","2965430"," He's a good guy."
"2965590","2966410"," He's easily approachable."
"2967630","2968470"," He's not a bad guy. "
"2968610","2969030"," He's a good guy."
"2969610","2971230"," You just come up to him and ask him nicely, say."
"2971610","2972030"," Ask him when he's chatting. "
"2972210","2973850"," He does a live stream every night."
"2974750","2977230"," I bet you can go into his chat at night time and say, hey, Bob."
"2980050","2985710"," Say, some weirdo on YouTube told me that you knew a lot about hedge funds blowing up in the 70s"
"2985710","2989230"," and 80s trying to short the Japanese stock market. "
"2990210","2991050"," Say that to him."
"2991390","2991990"," We found that."
"2991990","2992610"," I know him. "
"2992670","2993410"," He's stuck to him."
"2995710","2996270"," What about him?"
"2996270","2996330"," What about him?"
"2996330","2996610"," He's a good guy."
"2997150","2998110"," A guy that's smart as hell. "
"3000670","3001030"," Okay."
"3002230","3004390"," So we know what's happening right here, right?"
"3004790","3006310"," We're going to tell him something fun right now."
"3006350","3007630"," We're having a nice little fun Thursday. "
"3009990","3010690"," Not really."
"3011330","3017110"," Well, I shouldn't say I'm not a practitioner of Elliott Wave, but I'm aware of it."
"3017410","3018750"," I kind of get what's going on. "
"3018950","3019250"," Read the books."
"3019250","3020550"," Got a book over there about it."
"3022430","3025130"," I'll leave that up to the guys that are practitioners. "
"3025470","3026550"," I'm at their excellence at it."
"3027030","3029970"," I'd like to break up crayons or racers, though."
"3030130","3031090"," I agree with that too, right?"
"3031950","3034970"," They always have two or three answers, right?"
"3035650","3040770"," So, matter of fact, right here, we've got accumulations, schematic number one. "
"3042990","3045970"," We have accumulations, schematic number two, right?"
"3046510","3049090"," And then we've got, if this one doesn't work out, right?"
"3049230","3050030"," Break out the erasers."
"3050330","3054010"," We've got, oh, this one right here, right?"
"3054870","3056330"," And we've got this one right here."
"3057490","3060450"," So, and I'm going to show you all four right now. "
"3060790","3065710"," My point behind this is what you're going to be having, especially like this one, this number two"
"3065710","3066230"," right here, right?"
"3067090","3072750"," This could have been, let's say, October, October."
"3075650","3081450"," Can we go back up and close every one of those, every one of those gaps that we left behind?"
"3081650","3082630"," And we get, what do we get?"
"3083090","3084210"," All-time highs again."
"3085510","3086810"," But then you get a bear out there. "
"3086890","3091770"," They'll be like, well, it's really bearish if we do that, because eventually, doom."
"3097160","3098120"," Let's see it right here."
"3099060","3100500"," This is the all-time high play. "
"3101520","3102840"," Go up, blast off, right?"
"3103460","3105520"," Sell it down, sell it down, sell it down."
"3105640","3106060"," That's October."
"3107500","3107560"," UT. "
"3108280","3109420"," All-time highs again."
"3110060","3113340"," And then you speak to another bear and they're like, we're not doing that cap."
"3115720","3117240"," We're going to do the first two cap. "
"3118120","3119580"," And I'm like, okay, let's do the first two."
"3123320","3124220"," So, I'm like, which one?"
"3124720","3126280"," Are we going down this way right here?"
"3127680","3128180"," Is that one?"
"3128360","3128620"," What is that?"
"3128820","3128880"," October?"
"3131280","3133820"," So, you tell them where you're going all the way back up here, right?"
"3137620","3138680"," That's who you're telling me."
"3139540","3143120"," So, you're telling me that we're likely going to go wear on the spy on this one. "
"3146980","3148620"," Oh, yes, spy."
"3150580","3151900"," Where are we going on that one?"
"3154020","3156280"," Shit, we got a lot of room to go."
"3157140","3158340"," Where are we going all the way up here?"
"3158940","3159060"," What's that?"
"3159340","3159360"," 440?"
"3161880","3163300"," 460 somewhere up in there?"
"3165380","3166400"," What about the extensions?"
"3167400","3168900"," We know about extensions, right?"
"3169920","3171240"," So, are we going all-time high?"
"3171560","3173240"," Are we going all up to 440, 460?"
"3174140","3175540"," Are you just warning me?"
"3179680","3181720"," Are you threatening me with a good time?"
"3181880","3184560"," Are you telling me that this is not bullish?"
"3184900","3186580"," I should not have bought that dip. "
"3187660","3189960"," Are you threatening me with going to 340?"
"3192080","3192320"," 320?"
"3193320","3195560"," Are you threatening me with a good time buying that dip?"
"3196520","3199080"," Are you threatening me with another good time buying that dip?"
"3199560","3201660"," I guess I should have bought all three, right?"
"3203800","3206500"," I should expect 3,200 as the next target."
"3207900","3209540"," And to buy that one too, right?"
"3209740","3210080"," Bring it on."
"3214180","3216180"," Shit, this looks like a bottom to me. "
"3218000","3220780"," This looks like a bottom to buy 10 years from now."
"3223740","3224960"," Tell me which one it is."
"3229380","3231120"," It certainly doesn't look like a top. "
"3232020","3233220"," I can tell you this much."
"3235640","3237520"," I got ostracized."
"3240540","3241720"," Ostracized by bulls. "
"3245020","3247880"," When we were up here and they were like, why aren't you buying anymore?"
"3249120","3253000"," Now I'm getting ostracized by bears trying to buy this down."
"3253000","3256140"," So I'm currently sitting at 63 out of 100."
"3256420","3257200"," That indicates greed. "
"3257740","3260540"," Well, the crypto-faring greed index is still around 50."
"3261000","3264220"," Get an ostracized by bears trying to buy that right there."
"3266220","3268960"," If it's not these two, it's these two back here. "
"3271740","3274480"," Well, shit, I don't deal with this shit for a long time, do I?"
"3274760","3276040"," And we're going to all-time highs."
"3279400","3281780"," So I don't know where I'm wrong here."
"3281780","3282380"," I don't know where. "
"3282540","3283440"," I don't know what I'm doing wrong."
"3283440","3285140"," I'm going to be doing something wrong here."
"3291200","3291560"," Wonderbread. "
"3293520","3294400"," It's always one."
"3296320","3296680"," Wonderbread."
"3297100","3298940"," Do you know what else I was told?"
"3299460","3300500"," I've never seen breath. "
"3301340","3303140"," I've never seen breath that bad."
"3303740","3304800"," Not since the dot com."
"3305300","3307740"," You want to see breath that bad and still the market's still going up?"
"3308320","3308800"," You want to see it?"
"3309720","3310960"," I'll show it to you in recent history. "
"3312760","3314300"," I can show you that right now."
"3316080","3319000"," We haven't seen breath this bad since the dot com crash."
"3327860","3330680"," It's never been this bad since then. "
"3330860","3331760"," So let's take a look at that."
"3345890","3347710"," Dot com crash was terrible."
"3354360","3355780"," Come on, now get on over there. "
"3360560","3363400"," I should be doing a..."
"3364460","3366740"," Sometimes this chart doesn't want to go where I want it to go."
"3369580","3371220"," Dot com crash was horrible."
"3382600","3384760"," You shouldn't have bought the dot com crash. "
"3386800","3388080"," You shouldn't have done it."
"3389340","3390720"," I'm like, yeah, no."
"3391340","3393540"," If you bought that dip down there, you'd have made a bank. "
"3394260","3395760"," You bought that dip, two make a bank."
"3396020","3397460"," You bought that dip, two make a bunch of bank."
"3398340","3403920"," Something neat about this is notice how price didn't roll below the red line there and it didn't"
"3403920","3406800"," and the white line didn't roll below the white line. "
"3407080","3408400"," Do you notice that?"
"3409820","3412300"," We got one big old joy right up there."
"3413420","3419340"," You can see the big old bear playing up here though."
"3420740","3423620"," So if you'd ridden this up, you'd probably be pretty good, right?"
"3423940","3426580"," Like I made some money and it's now it's time to sell. "
"3427100","3427600"," Right?"
"3428840","3429880"," So not so bad."
"3430140","3431660"," Not as bad as you think, right?"
"3432500","3436940"," Not as bad as what's told to you."
"3437140","3445460"," So if you're a claps bear, you're looking for your claps bear on SPX, you're looking for a big old"
"3445460","3446520"," bear play on the daily chart. "
"3446880","3449680"," Until you see that big old bear play on the daily chart."
"3450220","3453700"," And even when you do see it, there's going to be a moment for you to watch."
"3456740","3459820"," The market attempt to get its head above water. "
"3461980","3462840"," And it'll fail."
"3463620","3465960"," And that's when you get your claps bear on."
"3466060","3466940"," It's when you put the bear suit on. "
"3467120","3472800"," It's when you put on the old grizzly bear and you get all crazy and you get all frothy at"
"3472800","3473820"," the mouth and all that kind of shit."
"3474020","3474620"," So that happens."
"3477220","3478040"," Don't do it, man. "
"3478220","3479740"," It's like it's just poison."
"3481000","3482220"," Don't be a part of that for retail."
"3482220","3484120"," You can sell the market down today. "
"3484680","3486080"," Sell the market down every week."
"3486080","3488640"," Sell it on monthly or a three month or something like that."
"3490200","3492300"," This isn't used watching my stream. "
"3492440","3496460"," I'm talking about like some real real influential pizza people out there that are saying that."
"3498500","3500120"," Real influential people."
"3500120","3501120"," They do it every week. "
"3501780","3504120"," Then they go through the rounds when they're wrong."
"3504980","3505980"," And try to explain themselves."
"3506320","3507120"," Like the timing's wrong. "
"3507340","3508600"," It's going to happen soon, I promise."
"3509440","3510940"," I'm looking at NVDA over here."
"3510940","3514340"," And if I just start calling it every fucking week, eventually I'll be right. "
"3515080","3516720"," And you can come back and suck me off."
"3518120","3518620"," You know?"
"3520440","3521700"," Just don't do it, right?"
"3522720","3525620"," Then I'm not talking about like 100,000 follower counts on Twitter."
"3525760","3527380"," I'm talking about people that are like influential. "
"3529380","3530980"," People charging you 300 bucks a month."
"3533160","3535720"," People that are, you know, they're on CNBC and shit like that."
"3535900","3536280"," It's just wrong. "
"3538740","3540820"," So move it on from all that."
"3542620","3547300"," We talked about whack me off distribution."
"3550680","3554640"," Talk about how to spot a crash. "
"3555820","3557540"," What to look for in a crash."
"3561720","3562280"," That nauseam."
"3565000","3568180"," And we're talking about the consolidation that's going on right now. "
"3569440","3569860"," On the spy."
"3571320","3573260"," We got one more day left, right?"
"3573380","3575160"," We got for short, short week here, right?"
"3575360","3575940"," One more day left."
"3576700","3577920"," And a whole bunch of puts that have printed. "
"3578760","3580960"," And the longer that we spend here, right?"
"3582900","3584480"," Longer we're hanging out down here."
"3584800","3586260"," Even if we could pitch late down here."
"3587180","3589960"," At some point, those dealers aren't going to want to pay those puts, are they?"
"3590300","3590920"," In a Friday. "
"3593540","3596080"," We're just going to hang out here and see what they do, right?"
"3596780","3598580"," We can get above this green line right here."
"3598800","3599760"," All we need to do."
"3602420","3604880"," Let's get above here and start making our way up. "
"3605120","3607720"," And whenever that moment is, I don't care if it's down here."
"3608480","3610800"," I don't care if it's up here."
"3612380","3617380"," We'll start trying to start torching all those puts for Friday. "
"3619740","3621680"," We have all these south side."
"3621800","3622860"," We're taking their money and running."
"3623640","3627520"," We're like, all right, time to wrap it up and go drink margaritas over the weekend and shitpost on"
"3627520","3627740"," Twitter. "
"3628680","3630240"," Time to go get my Lambo out."
"3630680","3632040"," Time to go get my G4 out."
"3634380","3635840"," Meanwhile, you'll be stuck here. "
"3637800","3639980"," Head into a Friday trying to sell the market down."
"3647670","3648790"," It's oozing down."
"3650130","3651810"," Don't threaten us with a good time. "
"3655510","3659490"," Oh, what do you mean no more livestream from Bob?"
"3662610","3664850"," You said that Bob doesn't do a lot."
"3665050","3667010"," Someone just said Bob doesn't do a livestream at night time."
"3668110","3669910"," Did he stop doing live streams at night?"
"3671170","3672950"," I did not know that if that's the case. "
"3674330","3678910"," He used to do them at night time at like 9, 10 o'clock at night, 11 o'clock at"
"3678910","3679110"," night."
"3679550","3680490"," I used to be able to stop."
"3680630","3684330"," I used to watch them religiously, but I don't anymore. "
"3684550","3685370"," Around the time anymore."
"3686230","3689290"," He was one of the best that makes nighttime videos."
"3689930","3696230"," If there's anyone out there that I'm like, I had only one nightly video to watch, probably Bob"
"3696230","3696450"," Kendall. "
"3697610","3701090"," I got nightly like what's going to happen tomorrow, what's going to happen next couple days."
"3707460","3707980"," Yeah."
"3709800","3711700"," So he's no more making those videos. "
"3712020","3719040"," Well, that's a big loss to young people that he's not doing that anymore."
"3720340","3721600"," That's a real shame."
"3722360","3723900"," Another one is like Larry Williams. "
"3724120","3725260"," I like Larry Williams a lot."
"3726200","3728880"," He doesn't make many videos or many videos any longer."
"3729060","3729920"," He does still make them. "
"3733100","3734420"," I didn't know that."
"3734560","3735220"," That's sad."
"3735220","3736420"," Bob Kendall's awesome. "
"3737400","3740460"," If there was like some guy that comes out every night and he's like, yeah, this is what you expect"
"3740460","3741620"," for the week or whatever."
"3741620","3742620"," He's probably it."
"3742860","3743900"," He's probably the guy. "
"3749560","3749960"," Yeah."
"3750060","3751860"," Bob's been driving to work podcast the night before."
"3752200","3752400"," Yeah. "
"3752720","3754080"," He's knows what he's doing."
"3755880","3756280"," Definitely."
"3758900","3761940"," It's crazy too, because you know, it's like you got Bob Kendall. "
"3762140","3765020"," I think he gets like 3,000, 5,000 views at nighttime."
"3765020","3769540"," I'm like, this guy only gets 3,000 views, 5,000 views."
"3770320","3774680"," And then I like pop on YouTube and I'm like, look at that fucking clown over there with 100,000"
"3774680","3775000"," views. "
"3775840","3778620"," Like, why are these people watching that guy and not Bob Kendall?"
"3785940","3788000"," No, yeah, that's a bear plane right there."
"3788680","3789840"," That's a bear plane right there."
"3792080","3793580"," That's a nice little bear plane right there. "
"3793680","3793980"," I see it."
"3795800","3800020"," He still does live streams."
"3800220","3800720"," I've been watching him. "
"3800800","3802820"," So John Klopp saying he does still do live streams."
"3803620","3804500"," He does the nightly."
"3806720","3808280"," Yeah, I like, I like his. "
"3810700","3812840"," I've always enjoyed or I've not enjoyed."
"3813120","3817280"," I've always like when you like Larry Williams is the same way."
"3817300","3820700"," When you like these guys have been the market for like ever, right?"
"3821660","3823780"," And one time I was talking to Larry Williams. "
"3825060","3828860"," And he was like, um, he was like, what else am I going to do?"
"3829240","3830420"," And I was like, I agree with that."
"3830600","3832500"," He's like, I'm in the market, this is my entire life."
"3833860","3838100"," He's like, I recorded every thing that took place in the market. "
"3838100","3840000"," He's like, I kept a ledger of it for all these years."
"3840960","3842940"," He's like, I'm still involved in the market."
"3843840","3848440"," And so he's got all this data and all this experience with the market. "
"3848780","3850440"," And it's like, you can't buy that."
"3851760","3852940"," You can't buy that wisdom."
"3853880","3855200"," That's when those guys are out there. "
"3855340","3857080"," It's like he's soaking up with like a sponge."
"3858380","3862980"," And you actually listen to those people and put weight to what they have to say."
"3866850","3867830"," They get to see you too. "
"3869870","3870850"," Yeah, I've been on discord."
"3871770","3872970"," I've been on discord."
"3874230","3875910"," I've been inside the discord trying to. "
"3876050","3877890"," So there's a few things going on here."
"3877930","3881710"," So I've been on the discord trying to hang out in there."
"3882890","3887790"," And I'm trying to do a bunch of work in the background right now for the website to launch the"
"3887790","3888770"," tool minimum. "
"3889010","3891090"," Well, a few tools to launch."
"3892850","3894390"," And we're trying to get this."
"3894750","3896110"," I only have four weeks. "
"3896850","3898990"," So we don't have, we don't have any more time."
"3899290","3900850"," Like time is of the essence right now."
"3901070","3902150"," And I'm telling you something. "
"3902730","3904610"," You see these guys make a nightly video?"
"3905270","3908130"," It might take like two, three hours on tops."
"3909430","3913150"," You guys see me do a brief every day when I do a live stream, right?"
"3913350","3917830"," I basically get a brief to you in about a half an hour around 3 p.m. every day."
"3918530","3919510"," We'll do a live stream. "
"3919630","3921470"," And I'll tell you this is what I expect for tomorrow, right?"
"3923130","3925250"," And then let's see somebody's making a video at nighttime."
"3925550","3929090"," Probably take some one to three hours to do in a live stream all day long."
"3929370","3933210"," It is it absorbs eight, 12, 10 hours a day. "
"3933970","3936330"," And then I'm trying to do other work for us in the background."
"3936330","3945790"," So it's like a 50, 60, 70 hour a week, a week job that it's a challenge."
"3946090","3950930"," Well, you guys, when you guys are out there watching like a, I don't know, someone that does a live"
"3950930","3951570"," show somewhere. "
"3952010","3955210"," You actually don't get that live show 365 days a year."
"3955810","3957630"," So we're going to have technical problems is my point."
"3957970","3960490"," Like yesterday I had some technique that I couldn't get a stream up yesterday. "
"3961690","3962710"," Technically I couldn't."
"3963170","3967210"," So when we make like a technically difficult show, like a live stream."
"3967890","3969230"," We're like, we're going to be there every day. "
"3970010","3972710"," There are going, we are going to run into some issues along the way."
"3975310","3977990"," Because it's every day because we don't take a day off."
"3978370","3979410"," So that happens anyways. "
"3980930","3982070"," Trying to get this tool up."
"3982130","3987410"," I want to get you guys this tool so that you can start using it at home and we can"
"3987410","3990170"," use it on the stream together."
"3991550","3994470"," And you can see what to look for with me. "
"3994790","3996410"," So that you can be like, Hey, I feel confident with this."
"3996530","3997410"," I'm going to make money with this."
"3998050","3999690"," You're going to start making money with me. "
"4000570","4002910"," So that you're a happy trader and a happy investor."
"4008940","4011940"," Yeah, stock charts is where I like to watch Larry Williams."
"4012260","4013420"," That's my favorite place to watch him. "
"4020810","4022630"," Who I have a fin to it."
"4022910","4023170"," Stalker."
"4024090","4024650"," I didn't know that. "
"4027430","4028550"," I didn't know I had fin to it."
"4028630","4028870"," Stalker."
"4029250","4029730"," I don't. "
"4029830","4031210"," I want you guys to know something."
"4031310","4031710"," I don't know."
"4032370","4036790"," I want you guys to know that it's not always me on fin to it. "
"4037270","4038770"," We have a team of people."
"4039830","4041790"," But sometimes it's me on fin to it."
"4041910","4042670"," Sometimes it's not. "
"4043770","4045570"," Oftentimes I'll make a response."
"4046170","4047210"," That's not me as well."
"4047850","4049490"," So if I talk to you, sometimes it's me. "
"4049610","4050350"," Sometimes it's not."
"4051050","4056010"," Same thing goes with some of you guys, some of you guys comment in a YouTube stream."
"4056450","4059130"," I have two people that actually work on all those comments. "
"4059850","4060290"," I try."
"4060650","4063830"," If there's like an important one, like, hey, cap, you have to look at this, I will."
"4065070","4070730"," And then the other thing is if I have stockers out there, Joe Donut taught me a famous lesson. "
"4070950","4072470"," Don't respond to stockers."
"4072610","4074050"," Don't respond to people that are trolls."
"4074610","4076930"," But if you have a name, I'll block them right now. "
"4079130","4081950"," Type his name into the chat and I'll just block him right now."
"4082790","4084150"," That way you can just go away."
"4084690","4086930"," Whether there's you like, it's kind of weird when you get stockers, man. "
"4087150","4088230"," It comes with the territory."
"4089430","4090370"," It's like a part of it."
"4090690","4091050"," It's crazy. "
"4092570","4094350"," You guys want to know something crazy."
"4096970","4098550"," I got something crazy for you."
"4100729","4102410"," So you might not know this. "
"4103590","4104189"," You may."
"4104590","4106310"," Some of you know this and some of you don't."
"4108109","4110270"," So if I piss you off on Twitter. "
"4111149","4113130"," If I've hurt your feelings on Twitter."
"4114710","4115270"," Right."
"4115450","4116330"," Twitter is built. "
"4117490","4118689"," For me to."
"4120390","4121109"," Hurt your feeling."
"4121410","4122550"," This is terrible to say. "
"4123410","4125550"," It's built to hurt your feelings."
"4126370","4129270"," So let's say I don't hurt your feelings, right?"
"4130109","4131189"," You're like, I kind of like that guy."
"4131229","4131569"," I like cap. "
"4131729","4131970"," He's awesome."
"4133090","4135350"," I'm not intended for you."
"4136050","4139390"," Twitter's algorithms does not want you to see me if you like me. "
"4140770","4144210"," Twitter's algorithm wants to put me in front of somebody that I'm going to get angry."
"4145410","4145770"," Okay."
"4146990","4151890"," So you're not going to see your favorite tweets from people that you're looking for content from. "
"4152029","4153950"," Like, hey, I'm short."
"4155430","4155790"," Clorox."
"4156490","4158710"," They're not going to put you in front of people that are short Clorox. "
"4158810","4160450"," They're going to put you in front of people that are long Clorox."
"4160890","4161370"," Does that make sense?"
"4162410","4163430"," And with all that said, right?"
"4167750","4169430"," If you know this, right?"
"4170649","4171750"," And you go on Twitter."
"4172950","4174790"," And you make an inflammatory statement. "
"4176069","4180250"," And I mean like something nasty like, I don't know, something really mean."
"4180450","4182930"," Well, I guess you can do that and you do get traction from that."
"4183090","4185750"," But if I pissed somebody off on fin to it, right?"
"4186189","4190630"," And if I do it intentionally, even if it's just slightly intentionally, right?"
"4191729","4194450"," And that person takes offense to it. "
"4195730","4198250"," They'll go around and tell every single person they know."
"4199370","4201470"," They'll be like, you know that guy out there coming to him, James?"
"4202070","4202690"," Fuck that guy."
"4203850","4205530"," And do you know what I get for that?"
"4206790","4207650"," I get traction. "
"4208830","4210850"," The stream is sponsored by Tix."
"4211010","4214810"," So if you're out there, if you're watching me right now, I want you to know something."
"4215650","4219370"," If you don't like me and you're watching me right now at this moment and you're in this stream"
"4219370","4221810"," watching me and you're on fin to it, bitching about me. "
"4222570","4223290"," Thank you."
"4224650","4227770"," Because what you do is you're mentioning my name."
"4228290","4229610"," You're making fun of me. "
"4230170","4231270"," And you think."
"4232650","4237630"," You think you literally think that you like defaming me or hurting me or something."
"4237870","4242810"," But the truth is of the 10 people you tell that to or the 100 people you tell that to,"
"4243310","4244010"," guess what they do. "
"4245450","4246550"," They go, oh shit."
"4247850","4250970"," Some guy I don't know named Kevin Jim James pissed off."

"4375740","4376640"," Somebody blocked him for me."
"4377740","4378960"," I don't know who blocked him. "
"4379060","4380120"," Somebody blocked him for me."
"4381940","4383280"," So yeah, he's blocked already."
"4384940","4386600"," He's been blocked on Fentuit. "
"4389640","4390980"," I'm not going to say who."
"4391340","4393200"," People in the stream have access to my Twitter."
"4393380","4394160"," I'm not going to say who they are. "
"4394280","4394720"," But thank you."
"4401150","4401770"," Yeah, John."
"4401910","4402670"," It looks like he's been blocked. "
"4402850","4403430"," Somebody blocked him."
"4404390","4405450"," It's kind of creepy, right?"
"4407730","4408730"," Yeah, they want engagement."
"4409010","4409650"," They want conflict. "
"4410190","4411130"," They want you to."
"4411750","4412750"," It's really bizarre."
"4413030","4413330"," It's really. "
"4413590","4414990"," It's really bizarre because."
"4415830","4417290"," Joe Donuts the one that turned me on."
"4417390","4418230"," You know, I'll stay with Quinn. "
"4419850","4422110"," Like if you ignore a troll."
"4422110","4425290"," They literally get you followers."
"4428270","4433490"," If you ignore them, they'll just keep going on and on and on and on and on and on and"
"4433490","4434170"," on about you. "
"4434630","4436790"," So you ignore them and they actually gain."
"4437010","4437930"," They'll get you followers."
"4438250","4438850"," So if you got a troll. "
"4440350","4441210"," That's what you do."
"4441590","4443450"," You ignore them and they make you."
"4444090","4445710"," The game trying to keep you relevant. "
"4446330","4446870"," Isn't that wild?"
"4447570","4448790"," It's really fucking crazy."
"4454250","4456110"," Yeah, yeah, we're we're consolidating here."
"4457350","4458150"," For a move higher. "
"4458290","4459470"," My view, we are so."
"4460930","4462370"," Got a nice giant gap."
"4462530","4464270"," I've really had beautiful gap pulled. "
"4467570","4469570"," We should be consolidating for a move higher."
"4471730","4473090"," It's like the weekend man, right?"
"4473270","4474590"," You have a nice move."
"4474970","4475530"," I wish we got. "
"4475990","4476670"," I'll be honest with you."
"4476730","4478150"," I wish we had more downside here."
"4478150","4482210"," I really wanted to see like 413 98 in any move higher here. "
"4483250","4484490"," I think it was short lived."
"4485550","4488030"," Like if we get a move higher here, it's not the big one."
"4488370","4488570"," So. "
"4489050","4493570"," I don't know, maybe 424, but maybe, but I really wanted."
"4493810","4494450"," I really like."
"4495350","4498210"," I really like would have liked to have seen a break of. "

"4507250","4509830"," It's a better it's a better set up to go long. "
"4511210","4512550"," But it's the weekend, right?"
"4512750","4514910"," So if we if we get above the screen box right here."
"4516970","4517970"," I'm your stalker."
"4521090","4530840"," Well, yeah, I encounter mentally and stable people frequently"
"4530840","4534380"," in my DMS. Yeah."
"4535840","4540880"," You know, I think it's like I can't like I guess I'm kind of asking for it to some extent."
"4540880","4541500"," I don't know. "
"4541580","4542320"," I don't want it, but."
"4544020","4544840"," It happens."

"4663790","4666310"," You're going to get a handle. "
"4666790","4668490"," So we'll talk about this here."
"4668850","4670030"," We're going to start squeezing here."
"4673070","4675090"," Four 19's were 46 cents. "
"4675290","4677270"," They're not trading 77 cents right now."
"4677430","4677650"," Yeah."
"4682710","4684310"," So you know how you get the. "
"4684610","4686650"," Yeah, you get a captain's alpha, right?"
"4687230","4689090"," I never shit post there at all, right?"
"4689850","4692890"," It's like let me take that that handle very serious."
"4693850","4696230"," Now it's being used for data, right?"
"4696410","4697950"," Like here's your levels every morning."
"4698990","4700190"," You get the shit. "
"4700510","4702690"," You know, I like the shit post on Captain's Alpha."
"4702690","4703570"," That's like my handle."
"4703970","4704690"," It's me, right?"
"4704990","4705290"," How you doing?"
"4705450","4705890"," What's going on?"
"4706030","4706710"," We sort of ship pot. "
"4708510","4710290"," We'll get some laughs out of it, whatever."
"4710630","4711690"," That kind of stuff, right?"
"4711850","4713210"," You get some alpha from me there."
"4713530","4714670"," I'd be like buy this and all that. "
"4715190","4716310"," I never tell you after."
"4716310","4717670"," I always tell you before."
"4718170","4719330"," I tell you what I'm entering before. "
"4719470","4720890"," I tell you what I'm exiting every time."
"4721490","4725310"," You never get like you'll get me being like burr, but that's after I'm exiting, right?"
"4725590","4727190"," You'll get me first say I'm long here."
"4727650","4729310"," So I'm always I'm one of those posters. "
"4729650","4730970"," I'm one of those people on Fintuit."
"4731650","4733290"," That never tells you after."
"4733610","4735070"," You'll never say you'll never see. "
"4735170","4737510"," I do a live stream where I'm like, I'm long."
"4738010","4738310"," I'm short."
"4738890","4739270"," I'm closing. "
"4739610","4740010"," I'm opening."
"4740670","4742130"," I am a rare person."
"4742550","4744650"," There's not many of us left on Fintuit. "
"4745110","4746430"," There's some, but not many."
"4748470","4752810"," So did I just started blocking bots for that same reason on this new handle?"
"4752990","4758250"," Because I'm not the guy that comes back afterwards and says, oh, look, I paper traded and took two"
"4758250","4759830"," sides of the trade and I'm showing you the winner."
"4760530","4761950"," It's always before, right?"
"4762310","4764230"," You guys see me lose on stream here sometimes. "
"4764450","4767190"," So it's a rare thing, right?"
"4767770","4769450"," So anyways, Kevin Jim James."
"4770110","4770930"," It's going to stay."
"4771170","4772010"," You'll get some alpha there. "
"4772630","4775410"," You're going to mostly get me there, though."
"4775730","4778030"," Like you're mostly going to get Captain Jim James there, right?"
"4778150","4778750"," Jim will be there."
"4779470","4780730"," We are launching a website. "
"4781490","4783750"," You're going to get a public Twitter."
"4784630","4788390"," That's a straight faced public face."
"4789470","4799410"," So a very sober, straight faced, straight laced Twitter handle that you can put in your tweet that. "
"4800450","4808190"," You're only going to get on that handle serious discussion and serious stuff like, hey, this is"
"4808190","4809210"," what to expect today."
"4810230","4812530"," If this goes wrong, do that."
"4813510","4819150"," So if you're looking for that, if you're looking for that serious Twitter handle, there aren't many"
"4819150","4820090"," of them left anymore. "
"4820630","4827190"," You tell me they're like, I think froggy trades still does it, but not many people out there on"
"4827190","4828490"," fucking long and Q."
"4828690","4829450"," I'm short and Q."
"4829610","4831450"," I close them open that kind of stuff."
"4831630","4834710"," So that handle, check it out."
"4834850","4839410"," It's called at or it's at trade the trigger. "
"4840990","4841950"," So check that out."
"4842550","4843510"," Don't tell your friends."
"4843850","4845690"," Don't go blabbing it on fin to it. "
"4846070","4847530"," You guys are here in the stream with me."
"4847610","4849250"," Just keep it amongst us right now to be cool."
"4849450","4849570"," Okay. "
"4850450","4854870"," Be cool because I don't want it to be like a 10,000 handle following a day or something from"
"4854870","4855050"," stupid."
"4855290","4856870"," I just want it to be a chill handle."
"4857330","4862890"," Put it up on your tweet deck or wait until it's up and running full time and put it up"
"4862890","4869330"," in your tweet deck and you'll get like super straight faced from the company. "
"4870670","4872910"," Get a big group of traders getting involved in this."
"4873630","4875630"," So this isn't the Captain Jim James show."
"4875750","4877690"," This is something that I'm a part of. "
"4878630","4884790"," It's not like trade the trigger is not Captain Jim James."
"4885810","4886970"," That are putting this together."
"4887270","4888290"," So I'm just a part of it. "
"4888610","4889830"," But you definitely want to get in."
"4889970","4894750"," You definitely want to be watching that shit because it's going to be pretty neat."
"4895090","4895870"," So it's going to be pretty cool. "
"4919880","4920240"," Yeah."
"4920380","4921340"," Joe Donut is a part of it."
"4921400","4926160"," We have some, we have, we actually have professional traders like licensed professional traders. "
"4926640","4931860"," Can't tell you who they are, but there's people involved in this on the background that will knock"
"4931860","4932580"," your socks off."
"4932580","4940640"," So now going up to close the gap above at 4, 1981, 4, 20, 40."
"4941940","4944360"," 4, 19 C is trading 98 cents. "
"4953940","4954500"," Yeah."
"4954620","4954640"," Yeah."
"4955240","4957120"," So check out that handle. "
"4958840","4962560"," Good morning, everybody."
"4963440","4967960"," I have a feeling that I have a feeling that people come on Twitter and they're like."
"4968900","4969860"," God damn it. "
"4969980","4971320"," He came back on Twitter today."
"4971400","4972580"," That means we're going to close our puts."
"4977320","4982500"," Yeah, we've got, I think by tomorrow. "
"4982500","4983960"," So we're in trend mode right now."
"4984140","4986280"," Just a word to you, word to wise."
"4986480","4996500"," We are in trend.exe. We can get a role and still be in trend mode here, believe"
"4996500","4997000"," it or not. "
"4997000","4997820"," Okay."
"4998260","4999500"," This isn't over yet."
"5002120","5003760"," But take the money and run up here. "
"5005880","5010620"," Take some money off the table, either here or above at 4, 20, 34."
"5011760","5014060"," And there should be a check back at some point."
"5014820","5015300"," Huge. "
"5016940","5018020"," Three trigger bull cluster."
"5019020","5020540"," Velocity on the side of bulls."
"5021460","5024600"," There's not a lot of money left in the options market right now. "
"5025120","5025740"," There's something."
"5025960","5027140"," Where are they going to take?"
"5027280","5029160"," Where are they going to snatch to put money from Friday?"
"5029880","5031380"," We'll have the entire move today."
"5031900","5033600"," Or we'll save some of that move for tomorrow. "
"5039010","5040090"," Right on, thanks, Slayer."
"5050880","5051280"," Nice."
"5055060","5056740"," Spoons, baby, making the money today. "
"5057740","5059600"," Nice little squeeze right there."
"5059720","5065880"," Big giant green bar on the 30 minute chart on the spy."
"5066620","5070440"," Trend day confirmed once again. "
"5071620","5075900"," Man, how do you pick them?"
"5077460","5078820"," Wonder how that happens."
"5080920","5083720"," Wonder how that happens."
"5084800","5085340"," We're going to. "
"5085400","5085640"," We're going to."
"5086300","5087720"," You guys are going to know on your own."
"5087720","5088560"," You're not going to need me. "
"5088660","5090420"," You're going to be like, Cap, we're going to trend day today."
"5097020","5098700"," Where are we at in the Wycoff cycle?"
"5099700","5100060"," No."
"5100260","5100460"," No. "
"5100620","5101780"," I'll show you guys that once more."
"5101960","5102880"," You guys want to see over time."
"5103060","5103180"," So. "
"5105180","5106560"," It doesn't really matter."
"5107720","5108960"," It doesn't really matter."
"5109220","5112620"," So the thing, when I say erasers, I'm serious. "
"5113380","5115420"," So you saw people this week making the rounds."
"5115480","5116420"," I'm not going to name names."
"5116420","5119180"," But you got people making the rounds this week. "
"5119300","5120520"," They're like, okay, the time is wrong."
"5122400","5124040"," Tell me you're going to know what I'm saying here."
"5124180","5125240"," Do not repeat these names. "
"5126740","5131580"," You don't want to go back up and close the gaps above."
"5132120","5136040"," You don't want to go back up and get all time highs."
"5137360","5138160"," That's bad. "
"5139480","5141420"," You want to roll over right now."
"5144560","5146480"," You can look at any one of these cycles."
"5146760","5148540"," I'm going to show them to you again right now. "
"5148720","5148840"," Okay."
"5149140","5154600"," So if we are, if even if we were to break out the crayons."
"5156320","5158320"," Even if we were to break out the crayons. "
"5159700","5161200"," And say, yeah, we got it wrong."
"5161400","5161680"," It's not."
"5166960","5167580"," Here we go. "
"5169100","5170640"," It's not schematic number one."
"5170820","5171400"," Give me the other schematic."
"5171800","5173940"," Give me accumulations of schematic number two. "
"5173940","5176500"," Give me distribution of schematic number three."
"5176840","5178280"," Number number two or number one."
"5178460","5179740"," Sorry, it's one and two and one and two. "
"5180300","5181560"," It doesn't really matter."
"5181720","5183840"," What really matters here is that."
"5185000","5187840"," What really matters here is that this move here. "
"5188920","5191340"," It's going to be quite, quite large here."
"5192920","5195160"," And that's in schematic number one."
"5195460","5197080"," That's in schematic number two. "
"5197960","5199940"," And on distribution schematics."
"5200980","5202040"," That's the scary one."
"5202040","5205420"," This is the one where we go up and actually get all time highs right here. "
"5206720","5207860"," We actually go past."
"5209940","5210740"," For 60."
"5210960","5212600"," So we're in a distribution event down here. "
"5214680","5218620"," Because it's weird because if you ask a bear, not a bear, but a clap's bear."
"5218720","5219600"," You're like, are we over here?"
"5220000","5220800"," And they're like, no."
"5222880","5225260"," In October, they were like, we're right here. "
"5227160","5229060"," We're going to roll right to the depths of hell."
"5230460","5233760"," So of course they found out that this is not the case, right?"
"5235300","5236740"," So we're not in that cap."
"5236980","5238320"," So I'm like, okay, so we're over here. "
"5239340","5241660"," If we're over here, we're getting all time highs, right?"
"5241820","5242080"," And they're like."
"5246910","5249390"," You don't want that because we'll have this over here."
"5249590","5249830"," Okay. "
"5250330","5251410"," So where are we?"
"5251730","5252770"," I want to know where we are."
"5253690","5254790"," Are we at a bottoming?"
"5257750","5258290"," You understand?"
"5258290","5260370"," So we're at a bottoming."
"5260710","5263390"," That means I should still be buying all these series. "
"5263970","5267370"," That means that it's just accumulation right now."
"5268870","5273870"," And to this point, like what Mike Barrie is doing."
"5275130","5278210"," Mike Barrie is like, you're going to fucking sell regional banks?"
"5279050","5280590"," Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye. "
"5280910","5283550"," Mike Barrie is like, bring out the commercial real estate for me."
"5284970","5291450"," He's like a skinny, skinny, like, skinny, like smart, like bull."
"5291870","5294190"," Even though he's a bear, he's like, he's like, send them all out. "
"5294230","5295650"," I'll buy them all at $1, please."
"5296930","5300410"," He's not buying an VDA, but he's like, send out the shit for me."
"5301750","5306450"," So we're probably down here in some capacity with a secondary cycle within it. "
"5307990","5310910"," Now if we are, it's pretty high up here."
"5311730","5313370"," So we're, and we're not there yet."
"5313370","5313990"," That's like 440. "
"5315190","5315630"," 440."
"5317090","5317530"," 460."
"5318550","5319950"," It's like worst case scenario. "
"5322150","5325590"," I can't take a collapsed bear serious, my point."
"5326710","5328150"," Like I can't take him serious here."
"5328210","5329090"," I can take him serious in fourth. "
"5329290","5330010"," I can believe it or not."
"5330050","5331050"," I can take him serious in 430."
"5331790","5334010"," Now I can take him serious at 440 and 460. "
"5335110","5336790"," I can take him serious at all time highs."
"5337330","5339610"," But at 420, I can't take him serious right now."
"5339610","5341210"," We're in that really weird place. "
"5342110","5344230"," Like we're not like, we didn't roll over in October."
"5345070","5350470"," And if that, and if we're coming up here, we must be going to at least go up and close"
"5351090","5354050"," some gaps that we've left behind for over a year."
"5354490","5356690"," Even if we're going to roll over later down to 320. "
"5358470","5362530"," And even if I'm wrong, I know what to look for."
"5362790","5364190"," I know what to look for in a daily chart."
"5365210","5370050"," I know I'm looking for that role on the daily chart with that big old bear playing and then I'm"
"5370050","5371430"," looking for not rejection. "
"5371430","5373330"," But like I can't get my breath."
"5373790","5374850"," We're going to roll down again."
"5375630","5376030"," Shit. "
"5376290","5377030"," Let's go down."
"5378310","5378750"," Right."
"5379070","5380070"," I'll join you. "
"5380170","5380610"," I'm in with you."
"5382290","5385010"," So until that happens, the move is higher."
"5387730","5389030"," That's what the move is. "
"5389770","5392210"," And there ain't nobody in Wall Street that's going to tell you that."
"5392690","5395050"," There ain't no way that JPM is going to tell you that."
"5398230","5404510"," I'll tell you what, if I, if I was trying to, if I was trying to get a million followers,"
"5404510","5406310"," I wouldn't be telling you that. "
"5409070","5409950"," I wouldn't."
"5410270","5413950"," If I was looking for churn, I would tell you to be crashing every fucking day."
"5415030","5415810"," That's what I would tell you. "
"5417610","5418330"," Or feed your fear."
"5419690","5423490"," I would find out every stock that you're upside down in and I would only cover those."
"5426610","5428890"," You know what would be the best part of that right now?"
"5429890","5434790"," I make, I would make videos on shorting and VDA every day. "
"5435590","5441390"," Because I know that thousands and thousands of retailers are getting torn up trying to do it."
"5442370","5445250"," And they would come and sit inside my stream."
"5447050","5450110"," And I tell them to join the, join the subscription service. "
"5451390","5458570"," And I'd have like 20,000 people watching because they're so angry that they can't short NVDA."
"5459690","5460610"," That's how you do it."
"5465230","5466270"," Yeah, I'm a clob spear. "
"5467070","5468590"," I'm not NTS going down to 320."
"5469010","5471650"," I'm not anti the roll over to 1600."
"5472490","5473350"," I'm a bear by heart. "
"5474030","5478750"," I just can't trade like a bear unless I can trade like a bear when the confirmation happens."
"5480830","5482210"," Just give me a smart trader."
"5483670","5488490"," Oftentimes as a retail trader, your best interests are being served. "
"5491450","5493190"," Whether you're a bear bull doesn't matter."
"5493530","5497090"," Bulls do the same thing like fucking Tesla trade in 1500."
"5498350","5505890"," If you go back to Twitter when Twitter was, when Tesla was trading like 1500, people are like, it's"
"5505890","5507210"," going to 3000 next week. "
"5507410","5508410"," And I'm like, dude, come on, man."
"5508550","5509890"," Don't be saying that shit to people on Twitter."
"5510650","5512450"," They're like, it's definitely going there, bro. "
"5512630","5514930"," And I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, it's not."
"5515210","5516970"," And they're like, you're not a real bull."
"5517650","5518770"," You're not a Tesla bull. "
"5518970","5520290"," I'm like, you motherfucker."
"5521150","5523830"," I'm like, if I get through Twitter right now, I fucking choke you."
"5526990","5528710"," Like that call me a real bull. "
"5528850","5529610"," I'm like, where were you?"
"5529770","5532370"," And we're in the depths of hell by in Tesla."
"5537430","5539090"," Get some some guy."
"5539190","5539730"," I don't even know. "
"5540010","5540810"," Like, who are you?"
"5541010","5542950"," I'm like, I've never met you before."
"5543710","5548150"," Coming into my DMS and telling me I'm not a bull because I'm not buying Tesla at 1500."
"5548890","5550070"," The fuck is wrong with you?"
"5554770","5555350"," I'm not. "
"5555450","5556430"," I'm not doing the cause."
"5557270","5557330"," Great."
"5557810","5560430"," Oh, that'll be a little bit of supply up there. "
"5564830","5568490"," I'm like, I'm like, what are you drinking?"
"5569030","5569810"," What are you?"
"5570210","5572390"," Like, this guy told me this."
"5572630","5573630"," I'm like, who is that guy?"
"5576010","5577810"," Like, who is that guy that's telling you this?"
"5578890","5583770"," And of course, it's like, you know, million fall or fucking tassel bull."
"5585170","5587350"," I'm like, that guy's been in. "
"5587730","5589590"," I'm like, I used to know that guy on Reddit."
"5589590","5590650"," Like, 20 years ago."
"5590810","5592990"," I used to know that guy 15 years ago and fucking Reddit. "
"5593550","5595790"," He was a nobody on Reddit."
"5596030","5597050"," He just happened to get rich."
"5599250","5600410"," He's selling you calls. "
"5600790","5601370"," Did you know that?"
"5601630","5603710"," That guy right there is selling you calls."
"5604610","5606810"," That guy's own Tesla since it was $5."
"5607410","5610390"," That guy wants you to buy calls, man. "
"5610730","5611830"," He wants you to buy them all day long."
"5618350","5620430"," Who Vix is really curious today."
"5620430","5624130"," It was you curious yesterday, too. "
"5626030","5629530"," So, so Vix is cutting itself loose right now."
"5629670","5631010"," Guess what Vix wasn't doing yesterday."
"5632150","5635590"," Vix refused to cut itself loose into that bell. "
"5636350","5638070"," Did you guys notice that yesterday?"
"5638350","5641250"," Like Vix dumped yesterday and priced it and move up."
"5645910","5653010"," Tag 4 1974 right back to where we were before."
"5653570","5656050"," Trying to try to mess around on that 420. "
"5659370","5660850"," Welcome back, baby."
"5661010","5662850"," Welcome back Carter 420."
"5664290","5669010"," If you thought you liked 412, I got something for you. "
"5669550","5670490"," It's called 420."
"5683380","5685900"," Let's talk about breath really quick."
"5686300","5687780"," Let's talk about Wonder Bread. "
"5688240","5689780"," We're going to talk about Wonder Bread next."
"5691180","5692320"," We're going to talk about what we're going to bring up."
"5692440","5694600"," We're going to actually talk about actual Wonder Bread here. "
"5695800","5696160"," Breath."
"5697380","5699600"," I'm like, ooh, this people want to talk about breath."
"5699860","5700420"," I'm like, I love breath. "
"5701160","5702400"," I'm like, that's my jam, man."
"5703880","5705660"," It's one of my jams out there."
"5706100","5706380"," Breath. "
"5706960","5707660"," Let's talk breath."
"5709180","5711080"," I love talking breath."
"5713220","5722780"," And then, of course, I'm told we haven't seen breath this horrible since we haven't seen this"
"5722780","5731250"," breath this horrible since 2001. "
"5731250","5733930"," I don't know if I believe that."
"5735330","5736630"," Like, can we get a pullback?"
"5737030","5737130"," Yes."
"5739010","5740230"," Can we get a roll?"
"5741550","5742010"," Yes. "
"5744110","5745070"," Is it a crash?"
"5746070","5746470"," No."
"5747470","5748930"," Do they care if it's a crash?"
"5749410","5749450"," Nope."
"5750130","5751510"," I already showed you NVDA. "
"5751750","5753630"," I said we could go all the way down to this number."
"5754670","5757090"," It's still not a crash on NVDA."
"5757090","5763550"," Now, these people that are selling you this will tell you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, look at it"
"5763550","5764650"," called it, it's a crash. "
"5765570","5770590"," But in fact, it's still trading above its 21 EMA on a daily chart, right?"
"5770810","5771190"," It's still there."
"5772930","5775350"," So, it's not an actual crash, is it?"
"5776190","5777810"," It's not an actual crash."
"5780690","5783570"," So, remember when these people tell you these things. "
"5783570","5792590"," And these people are out there and they're like, breath is horrible and it is breath is horrible"
"5792590","5799090"," and it diverges from price on NQ and the spy."
"5800090","5805090"," So, my next question on that is, I realize breath is dogshit."
"5806090","5812230"," When breath does, well breath is very close to us reaching a top here for a nice roll. "
"5812850","5816770"," But when we do get that roll, even when we do roll price is important."
"5817810","5819730"," Where do we roll to?"
"5821270","5824630"," Because the claim is market crash."
"5825730","5828390"," And I'm like, I don't know about that right now. "
"5828390","5831050"," And they're like, well, we haven't had that since 2000."
"5831630","5833070"," And I go, that's not true."
"5834530","5835630"," That's not true. "
"5847160","5849260"," I'm going to show you an instance of it right now."
"5851300","5853200"," Because I am that fucking guy."
"5853680","5860670"," I'm going to show you one right here. "
"5865080","5867560"," This is, what is this?"
"5869040","5870640"," November of 2020."
"5871780","5872800"," Here's one right here."
"5875420","5877660"," Here's an instance of breath going a dogshit. "
"5879360","5881520"," Here's an instance of breath going a dogshit."
"5882200","5883900"," And we just melted straight up."
"5884960","5887120"," And the pullback wasn't that bad, was it?"
"5887260","5887900"," It was a Bible dip. "
"5888340","5889880"," Wasn't a new low, was it?"
"5890700","5891540"," So this is 2020."
"5892620","5893740"," Here's one right here."
"5895680","5901960"," And the statement was made that we haven't seen this since 2000. "
"5903320","5907460"," I'm not going to bother wasting my fucking time going back to 2000."
"5907460","5910460"," When I found one right there on breath."
"5913620","5920460"," So, when the statement is made, that breath is worse than it's ever been ever since 2000. "
"5921420","5922080"," That is wrong."
"5926880","5927740"," Number two."
"5929640","5931780"," Looking over here, breath is dogshit. "
"5932000","5934900"," You can see that breath is dogshit down here, right?"
"5935040","5937520"," Dogshit, dogshit, dogshit, price is going up."
"5937520","5939760"," There's a divergence in dogshit."
"5939940","5942660"," We know in recent history this can happen. "
"5943260","5946600"," We also know breath continues to get worse."
"5947020","5949940"," There is risk of a rollover, right?"
"5950520","5952020"," We also know that breath can improve."
"5954240","5957180"," And then the risk of rollover actually declines. "
"5958300","5962520"," We could actually have parts, sectors of the S&P 500."
"5964200","5967880"," Jump in and help the S&P 500 to go up."
"5970900","5977780"," So, the first pause that we're going to make is we've seen this already. "
"5982340","5991540"," We also know from previous examples examples that even if we do get a lower high right here, we"
"5991540","5992400"," come back down."
"5992400","5996500"," We also know that this can easily be bought."
"5998340","6001760"," We also know that breath can bottom down there. "
"6002940","6005100"," And then we continue on higher again."
"6005900","6008360"," There's nothing in here saying we're going to crash."
"6009040","6009100"," Nothing. "
"6009580","6014060"," And that examples of it just an easy one for you that I showed you."
"6014260","6015320"," You want to see another easy one?"
"6018180","6019780"," Where breath is the worst?"
"6022180","6024480"," It's not even in 2020."
"6026340","6028160"," It's this run right here. "
"6028860","6032900"," It's not even in 2020."
"6034320","6035920"," So, when we rolled, what do we do?"
"6036280","6037040"," We continued higher."
"6038620","6044360"," So, if you don't think this market can stay rational longer than you can, it can. "
"6048230","6058070"," You must see those bare planes on a daily chart on individual tickers."
"6058810","6068590"," You must see that bare plane on the daily chart on the spy, on the cues, on"
"6068590","6069210"," NDX."
"6070010","6071310"," You have to see those things. "
"6078220","6079420"," So, wonder bread."
"6079880","6082480"," Breath is the worst that's been since that time."
"6082760","6083520"," No, it isn't. "
"6084940","6085760"," No, it's not."
"6087360","6089460"," You're wrong again."
"6091260","6092660"," You're wrong again. "
"6094200","6095460"," You want to see it on a weekly?"
"6097920","6098940"," Here it is on a weekly."
"6099760","6100900"," This is just the most recent one."
"6101700","6102360"," One right there. "
"6104680","6107040"," We blasted higher right up to the end right there."
"6107120","6107920"," Here's another one coming."
"6108440","6109160"," Do we get a roll?"
"6109500","6109580"," Yeah. "
"6110120","6110680"," We get the roll."
"6112080","6113120"," But where is the roll?"
"6113380","6114100"," Is the roll a crash?"
"6115060","6115120"," No."
"6116360","6117480"," No, it's not a crash. "
"6118720","6120160"," Do we get a squeeze higher here?"
"6121240","6122040"," Do we grab 424?"
"6122740","6123800"," Do we get a failure to grab 424?"
"6125280","6125920"," And then do we roll?"
"6126280","6126940"," Where is the roll?"
"6127200","6127500"," Is it 396?"
"6129720","6130380"," Is it 400?"
"6130380","6136300"," It sure as shit is in 360, nor 320, and nor 280."
"6136660","6138260"," And you know if they're wrong, you know what they do?"
"6138840","6142880"," They just come back to you and say, we didn't get the price we wanted."
"6145980","6149400"," We didn't get the price that we wanted, but we wanted you to know. "
"6151540","6153260"," At least it rolled."
"6153840","6155100"," We made money, but we closed."
"6157200","6164240"," So when you're hearing this from people, right, I said to you really this morning, I was like, I"
"6164240","6168580"," would have liked to have seen, would have liked to have seen to get down here to the daily. "
"6168580","6169340"," We didn't."
"6169660","6171380"," This is likely going to be short-lived."
"6172580","6177180"," Not expecting like huge moves, but we've got some gaps at 424. "
"6178140","6180900"," We have, we can do a failure to do this one right here."
"6180900","6185020"," We can squeeze right up here and get that nice roll into middle of June."
"6186160","6188980"," So June 16th, something like that. "
"6189500","6190080"," What are your expectations?"
"6192760","6194000"," 400, 396."
"6195560","6196840"," We move in the goal post."
"6197200","6197680"," Now, is that a crash?"
"6199420","6200120"," 412, 408. "
"6200640","6200820"," What is it?"
"6200900","6204760"," 408, 406, 400, 396."
"6206260","6207060"," It's almost 300 points."
"6208840","6209920"," It ain't 3,200. "
"6210920","6212120"," It ain't 3,600."
"6213120","6216540"," And shit, 3,800 at 420 looks pretty big, doesn't it?"
"6219240","6223040"," So just be like, think about what these people are telling you."
"6225820","6227560"," Can we go down there to 360?"
"6228300","6228620"," We can. "
"6230340","6231980"," We'll see it before it happens."
"6232860","6233560"," We'll see it happen."
"6234020","6236060"," We'll be like, yeah, okay, we know we're rolling over here. "
"6236640","6240220"," We know that, we know that breath is getting shitty."
"6241180","6242960"," You're telling the market crash, right?"
"6243120","6245720"," I'm like, no, dude, two months ago we had bad breath."
"6248860","6252000"," So the market can stay in Russia longer than you can. "
"6252840","6254480"," You trade what's in front of you."
"6256140","6259340"," And you, you trade what's in front of you."
"6259820","6261860"," And you definitely do not drink that syrup. "
"6264300","6265420"," That's bad for your health."
"6267280","6275070"," Go right there."
"6279600","6281700"," Vic's trading down to the bottom of its channel right now. "
"6283380","6286560"," The one in five minute chart is looking like we're going to get a quick roll right here."
"6286700","6287800"," So just be careful if you are along."
"6291440","6301160"," Vic's trading $16.21. $16.21. It's trading the bottom of its downward channel. "
"6303480","6307700"," The one in five minute are getting extremely bearish which is actually bullish for Vic's."
"6309160","6313220"," The hourly could go down a little bit more though I am liking it down here."
"6324790","6329970"," It's only at minus, it's only at minus 23 so it can actually go to minus 25 easily. "
"6330970","6333190"," We're going to start topping it out here for a moment."
"6334830","6337150"," On the spot soon soon soon."
"6346820","6348840"," Hey Mark, I'm actually good to see you this morning. "
"6348840","6349180"," How are you?"
"6350600","6351420"," So there you go."
"6351620","6356900"," You can come back into this video later today and you can review all that stuff."
"6357120","6358440"," But these are all simple things man. "
"6359000","6362040"," These aren't even like I'm like, let's get some high concepts out there."
"6362500","6366400"," I didn't know any constant, constant gave me a shout out the other day."
"6366440","6366820"," That's awesome. "
"6367660","6369340"," I appreciate you telling me that."
"6369340","6372160"," I didn't see that comment for Andy so I'll find him."
"6372720","6373620"," I like Andy a lot. "
"6374240","6378320"," I like him a lot because of how smart he is."
"6379480","6381300"," I like him a lot because he's an active trader."
"6382760","6387060"," I also like him a lot because he's very honest on Fintuit. "
"6387920","6390380"," It's a rarity on Fintuit."
"6399780","6401940"," We want to see if we can get back down here."
"6401940","6404220"," Watch this way to watch this down here. "
"6408430","6412710"," See if we can get a recheck down below on the one minute."
"6414590","6417590"," I'm coming in to check that yellow right now."
"6417710","6419810"," I'd like to see that then maybe that close right there. "
"6420610","6421850"," Something like that I'd like to see."
"6423190","6425330"," You could tee off right on this one right here."
"6430810","6432290"," It's a nice supply above there. "
"6432390","6433390"," We can grind right up into it."
"6437370","6440630"," Why is the dump roll always six to 12 months out?"
"6440830","6443530"," It's a good question."
"6444030","6445210"," There's no dump roll. "
"6446750","6447750"," That's what I should have said."
"6448310","6449090"," Let's look at a few things."
"6451770","6453550"," Why are we rooms asking a great question?"
"6454490","6456810"," Why is the dump roll always six to 12 months out?"
"6458090","6460830"," You typically get a quarterly low. "
"6461510","6463470"," If you're in a normal market."
"6463470","6473350"," Every quarter, if the quarter is green, you're going to expect a quarterly low of some"
"6473350","6473690"," kind."
"6474430","6479870"," If the market is constantly going down, we're not getting the roll in six to 12 months. "
"6481210","6484510"," A lot of people don't want to take some."
"6485130","6490790"," You'll hear people out there say if you look at all of this data except for COVID."
"6492370","6493970"," I'm like, you can't do that. "
"6494590","6496150"," Can't exclude COVID."
"6497050","6498470"," There's like the secondary."
"6499490","6503510"," Weird market or the business cycle has been created. "
"6503510","6504670"," You can't discount."
"6505030","6505470"," It's real."
"6507190","6508610"," The second thing is this. "
"6509850","6511670"," I've never in my history in this market."
"6511670","6515490"," I've never seen a market so fraudulent."
"6518310","6519550"," I don't know if it's intentional. "
"6520090","6525070"," I don't know if the banks are complicit with the Fed and the Treasury Department."
"6526310","6529910"," It's like, I don't know if it's the algorithms that are doing this."
"6530010","6531010"," I don't know if it's the banks. "
"6531450","6534310"," I don't know if it's a combination of all these things."
"6535250","6538210"," I saw the Fed doing the sentiment things on Twitter."
"6538530","6540470"," I don't know if it works or not. "
"6541550","6545350"," But you don't think I'm going to ask you a serious question."
"6546930","6550930"," You don't see the surgery going on in the stock market."
"6551190","6552670"," Then I don't know what to say to you. "
"6554190","6556270"," When we had the COVID crash, right?"
"6557010","6558050"," We got like a COVID crash."
"6558870","6561630"," Then we get pumping in the market, right?"
"6562250","6565110"," That crash was like straight down the depths of Holland straight back up again."
"6565730","6572450"," Then in 2020, in December, we started to surgically cut out all the cancer, right?"
"6574690","6576950"," All these companies that didn't do it, they're supposed to. "
"6577590","6583810"," They're holding up the S&P 500 as they saw off one leg at a time so it doesn't crash,"
"6584330","6584450"," right?"
"6585390","6589350"," We had a small demolition go on in 2022."
"6589350","6598590"," If you're watching all this stuff from a sober face, it's like, geez, they're trying to save"
"6598590","6600390"," 401Ks or something."
"6601270","6607850"," They're trying to save CLOs, CMBs, CMSs. "
"6608950","6612210"," They're trying to save the housing market."
"6613550","6617510"," They're watching all this while doing destruction."
"6619590","6621350"," I've never seen it quite like this. "
"6622110","6625030"," I've never seen the banks involved in it."
"6625310","6628230"," It's a handshake with the corporate rating too at the same time."
"6628930","6635110"," I've never seen this much volatility in the market either. "
"6635770","6639250"," If you're a new market participant, our market is not typically like this."
"6639590","6640870"," Our market is typically quieter."
"6642090","6644750"," This market hasn't been unquiet. "
"6644750","6647750"," We don't normally crash every two years."
"6648570","6651410"," Every three to five, we have an event and it goes away."
"6652410","6657770"," You might have a moment like a quarterly low or some big huge bloodbath, but it recovers. "
"6658470","6661110"," You don't see progressively new lows all the time."
"6661190","6663850"," It's not the norm for our market."
"6664550","6669570"," When I was discussing with you earlier about the price of Apple stock and how many times it's"
"6669570","6673110"," split, people don't like talking about that. "
"6674210","6679590"," Even if the price of Apple goes up and down, all those splits over all those years, those people"
"6679590","6680910"," are filthy rich."
"6682090","6683050"," It's gone vertical."
"6683470","6685450"," It's never ever turned back around. "
"6685990","6687990"," Some companies turn back around, right?"
"6688270","6690470"," Apple might fall out of favor one day."
"6690850","6693850"," You might have picked the shit stock like Peton and not an Apple."
"6694510","6702370"," But generally speaking for decades on end, you'll see companies just rise as they grow for 10, 20"
"6702370","6702770"," years. "
"6705090","6706610"," Oh, you're being a bit suspicious."
"6707410","6707590"," Sorry."
"6708430","6709170"," Yeah, man. "
"6709350","6710390"," It's not normal, man."
"6710570","6712370"," It's just not the fucking norm, is it?"
"6714530","6715750"," Oh, yeah."
"6716270","6718610"," Didn't even go back to check the one minute. "
"6719070","6723090"," 420, 21 to close the gap up on high."
"6723950","6726330"," Just pure trend day here."
"6726330","6730050"," Kind of day where you just buy some calls and don't do anything. "
"6730730","6734870"," Just leave them on all day long as they go up here and close all this stuff up."
"6735450","6737190"," Hello, trend day."
"6742450","6743710"," Hello, trend day. "
"6745490","6748090"," Trade in 420, 30 right now."
"6774780","6777840"," If you can't, if the discord is not working for you."
"6779280","6782400"," Then you have not read and said yes to the rules. "
"6783160","6784580"," It's not working for you."
"6785680","6787120"," No worries, mate."
"6787440","6787860"," I got you. "
"6797760","6802980"," This is the day where you buy calls and you don't touch them."
"6803680","6805080"," They just go up."
"6806260","6806980"," All right. "
"6807220","6808720"," What are the targets do we have above, right?"
"6809040","6811960"," We've got the gap left behind."
"6814480","6816740"," The scene of the crime up here."
"6817600","6819200"," Just two days ago. "
"6820440","6823320"," Do we save that for Friday?"
"6833060","6834500"," Beautiful thing right there."
"6835120","6836360"," Gorgeous thing right there."
"6836380","6836540"," Oh, yeah. "
"6836920","6837980"," Beautiful, beautiful thing."
"6840420","6841780"," 419 C's."
"6842180","6844480"," Trading $1.45 right now. "
"6844540","6846460"," They were 47 cents earlier this morning."
"6847520","6857870"," Now $1.47. I had agreed."
"6858030","6859910"," It just doesn't appear for me anymore. "
"6859910","6861050"," It was there Sunday."
"6863350","6863910"," Fledronis."
"6866390","6872070"," You might have been swept up in a bot that we were created to capture scammers. "
"6873490","6876690"," You might have said something that was picked up."
"6877330","6878350"," Do me a solid brother."
"6879470","6880890"," Can you do me a solid and?"
"6883210","6884630"," Send me an email. "
"6886230","6891130"," Either DM me on Discord or send me an email on Gmail."
"6893590","6895830"," Just contact me on the website if you want."
"6896070","6902890"," I forget my"
"6902890","6910870"," email. "
"6914860","6916720"," That was another thing we did."
"6917040","6917560"," Fledronis."
"6918100","6921360"," We were kicking in active accounts as well. "
"6924900","6928360"," Yeah, just send me a you welcome big bass about 86."
"6935740","6939680"," Okay, so if you were kicked out of the discord, you could have been swept up."
"6939680","6941140"," We were trying to sweep out the bots. "
"6942800","6949140"," If you were kicked, send me just an email quick email with your name and I'll reinstate you."
"6966440","6968880"," Okay, so I have to take a phone call here."
"6980930","6981370"," Yes. "
"6983250","6984050"," Hold on a second."
"6984250","6985070"," Let's see who he is."
"6986190","6987230"," Hold on a second here. "
"6987850","6989130"," I've got some stuff to do in the background."
"6991050","6992090"," Hold on here."
"6995690","6999210"," So, this is a message for Z-holy croissant. "
"7001290","7005370"," I blocked you on Fintuit and I apologize."
"7008090","7009790"," I do apologize."
"7010270","7010930"," Hold on a second there. "
"7012450","7013850"," I've got you on block here."
"7014070","7015310"," I'm going to block you right now."
"7017850","7021110"," I have I put out some hold on here. "
"7021250","7022050"," So, sending support."
"7022310","7024010"," Professional to his career studio."
"7024410","7025970"," I think that's setting in support. "
"7026310","7027150"," Setting some privacy."
"7030230","7031870"," Setting privacy in safety."
"7035030","7036050"," Mute in block. "
"7037550","7038170"," Blocked accounts."
"7039630","7040670"," Where is he at?"
"7043470","7044070"," Unblocked."
"7044650","7045010"," Unblocked. "
"7045450","7045810"," Unblocked."
"7045910","7046090"," Okay."
"7046230","7046610"," So, Anthony. "
"7047130","7048070"," You good to go, brother?"
"7048290","7048730"," I got you."
"7049310","7049630"," Oh."
"7050790","7051310"," Scalp 42. "
"7052350","7053070"," Anthony Scalizzi."
"7053510","7055290"," Dude, Chrison, is that you?"
"7059340","7060620"," You're good to go, brother."
"7062720","7063600"," You dirty dog. "
"7065600","7067020"," I thought you were a bot, brother."
"7067380","7070160"," I didn't know you were a real man, but you talked to me all the time, so you're good."
"7073200","7074080"," Is that him?"
"7074080","7074420"," I'm okay. "
"7074580","7075140"," I unblocked him."
"7075240","7075720"," He's good to go."
"7078100","7078900"," He's good to go. "
"7082740","7084000"," What's moral tryptitude?"
"7085180","7087060"," What is moral tryptitude?"
"7093140","7093940"," Moral tryptitude."
"7096720","7098600"," Who's writing a moral tryptitude rule?"
"7099280","7099640"," Are you interpreting?"
"7101160","7103460"," Wicked deviant behavior consisting of moral."
"7104180","7104540"," Yeah. "
"7104760","7104820"," Okay."
"7104920","7105680"," Let me read it to you, okay?"
"7106740","7107580"," Let me explain it to you."
"7107580","7107620"," Yeah. "
"7108260","7109820"," Moral tryptitude."
"7111250","7112100"," Or turpitude."
"7112860","7115120"," It's a phrase that describes being wicked. "
"7116020","7121980"," Deviant behavior constituting in a moral, unethical, or unjust departure from ordinary social"
"7121980","7122660"," standards."
"7123720","7125580"," Such that it would shock a community."
"7127180","7133600"," So, the idea here would be crimes, right?"
"7134040","7135860"," Things that are done viciously or evil. "
"7136680","7138260"," I'm not going to bring those up here."
"7138360","7142840"," I'm assuming that you can look these up and find out what they are on your own because they're kind"
"7142840","7143540"," of gross and disgusting."
"7145040","7148140"," So, the idea here would be we're an open community. "
"7151400","7153440"," We're here for financial stuff, right?"
"7154140","7159080"," Like in the chat, we can put on politicians when they matter towards the price of a stock."
"7160040","7161380"," But inside that community, you want to make sure."
"7162020","7162460"," Yeah. "
"7166100","7166540"," Doxed."
"7167860","7169700"," I got you back into the Holy Cresson."
"7170120","7171800"," I thought you were a bot dude. "
"7172460","7173280"," I thought you were a bot man."
"7174140","7182420"," You've been having problems in, you've been having problems inside of Discord with Bitcoin or"
"7182420","7183560"," crypto scams."
"7184580","7185540"," I didn't know it was you brother. "
"7185960","7188180"," I was like, oh man, these guys got locked accounts."
"7189500","7190760"," He's doing blockchain stuff."
"7190760","7193560"," I was like, and he found out about the handle. "
"7193820","7196280"," So, maybe he's inside the Discord running Bitcoin stuff."
"7196560","7197100"," I didn't know it was you."
"7199360","7200580"," Yeah, I think the rule is great. "
"7201660","7203180"," You know what I'm talking about, right?"
"7203880","7208620"," So, you might not be nefarious, but there are Discord steps and pretty nefarious stuff, right?"
"7208900","7210680"," Some really heinous stuff."
"7211420","7212380"," So, just nothing heinous."
"7212720","7214740"," Like, no posting heinous things inside of the Discord. "
"7215300","7215680"," Pretty simple."
"7220880","7227410"," Yeah, well, so I left some bait out the other day."
"7227670","7229670"," So, you guys may or may not know this. "
"7229830","7231850"," So, I'll tell you guys, honestly."
"7232450","7235950"," So, the other day, I was like, oh, I'm going to leave some bait in the Discord because we're"
"7235950","7236550"," getting over rubber."
"7236550","7240270"," We're having problems with bots or with scammers. "
"7240370","7245110"," So, I'm like, oh, find out if anyone's scraping the, I was like, I'll find out if anybody's"
"7245110","7251030"," scraping the Discord and I'll leave a paper trail to this new handle."
"7251030","7254410"," And then I'm going to find out who they are."
"7254610","7258550"," I'm going to go find out like the first 40, 50 people and check their profiles. "
"7259910","7261810"," So, I did that on Tuesday."
"7264590","7266190"," So, they get, so they have a fishing."
"7266890","7271730"," They find out who, who, because I'm like, oh, if they're scraping inside the Discord, they'll"
"7271730","7274830"," definitely find that, that Twitter handle. "
"7276030","7277830"," And then they'll follow it with a bot."
"7277830","7280230"," So, I'm like, I'm going to find out who the bots are."
"7280450","7284610"," If they come back to me and say something to me, I'll unblock them. "
"7285270","7289030"," If they don't, I know they were a bot inside of the Discord."
"7289750","7294830"," And then I'm going to have my dev hunt down that fucking bot and find out who they are."
"7298290","7298890"," It's true. "
"7301950","7302610"," Sorry, Chris."
"7302790","7304370"," I apologize, brother."
"7310530","7311930"," Probably shouldn't be saying that. "
"7312710","7317630"," We have a bunch of return to the scene, the crime stuff up here, just so you guys can see"
"7317630","7317770"," it."
"7318750","7320250"," We got another one right here."
"7320690","7323950"," Got this one right here that needs to be closed, that we had this gap to close. "
"7324810","7325950"," We have a pre-market high."
"7326310","7328150"," We have all this criminality back here."
"7328830","7331370"," All this stuff up here needs closed above as well. "
"7335550","7339410"," So, we know about this."
"7339550","7341130"," So, we got another pre-market high right here, too."
"7341830","7343230"," Kind of one of those trend days. "
"7343410","7344570"," You guys know what a trend day is?"
"7345190","7347270"," You just buy calls and just sit on them."
"7349210","7353710"," Until about, like, one in the afternoon, two in the afternoon, 1130, whatever you feel like doing."
"7360520","7361920"," Just ride the wave, man. "
"7370240","7373580"," Yeah, it's Captain Jim James at gmail.com."
"7374760","7377440"," Just Captain Jim James at gmail.com."
"7377600","7384260"," I have another one for the website, but I still don't remember what the actual, uh, my title is"
"7384260","7384420"," there."
"7384560","7390020"," It's like, it's either CJJ or Captain Jim James at, uh, the trigger.com, but I'm not sure what it"
"7390020","7390540"," is right now."
"7395180","7401680"," Captain Jim James at gmail.com, and I do have, uh, that email is checked every day. "
"7409440","7414560"," Yeah, so just do that gmail.com, and that one is checked every day."
"7415360","7416540"," At least once a day."
"7417500","7418540"," Uh, yeah, my real name is Jim. "
"7419160","7420060"," Uh, it's not James, Jim."
"7420360","7421660"," Both James, but I go by Jim."
"7421660","7429060"," Uh, it's my last name, James. "
"7429500","7431940"," No, it's not James."
"7432140","7432600"," It's not James."
"7432940","7435560"," It's my last name is different. "
"7438160","7440440"," My first, my real name is Jim."
"7442160","7450280"," Uh, but I don't, I have real fear out there of, uh, as things are changing in social media."
"7450280","7459400"," It's, um, difficult to, uh, it's, it's really scary with artificial intelligence"
"7459400","7463640"," to give too much information away to people. "
"7464220","7466420"," So there are people here that know who I am."
"7466660","7468540"," They know my private life."
"7469700","7475540"," Um, but it's hard because people like to do swatting and that kind of shit. "
"7475760","7477980"," They do really nefarious shit, right?"
"7477980","7479020"," They'll swat you."
"7480480","7485900"," They'll, they, you can, you can, you can mimic my voice and call my wife and say I'm in a"
"7485900","7487560"," hospital dying and that kind of stuff."
"7488420","7492360"," Um, you know, there's some really nefarious shit. "
"7492660","7501240"," Like the days of old, um, can't, like, but as a matter of fact, I did go to my police"
"7501240","7501600"," department."
"7502340","7503340"," This is a shocker."
"7503500","7504200"," You want to hear some crazy?"
"7504480","7505080"," I've talked about this. "
"7505360","7507060"," I actually did go to my police department."
"7507780","7510260"," Uh, and tell them who I was."
"7510980","7514060"," Because I have real fear of, uh, getting swatted. "
"7515200","7517300"," Um, they have children."
"7517680","7519980"," They have young daughters and a wife."
"7525420","7526880"," You'd get that shit done, Winky. "
"7529620","7530200"," That's right."
"7532200","7533200"," Captain whiskey James."
"7533860","7535520"," I think wifey called me that the other day. "
"7536100","7541540"," So wifey and I were talking in DM's the other day and wifey goes, he goes, you're Captain whiskey"
"7541540","7541960"," James."
"7542120","7542300"," Are you?"
"7542420","7543320"," I'm like, fuck yeah, man."
"7543640","7544800"," I'm like, I'm breaking my ass. "
"7544920","7545580"," This is this month."
"7545640","7546580"," I'm like, I'm getting drunk."
"7546980","7548240"," I'm like, I don't drink, man. "
"7548540","7549580"," I'm like, I'm going to get drunk."
"7554980","7558400"," I was talking with Winky, or not Winky without wifey the other day."
"7558600","7559540"," Was it a wifey's alpha?"
"7559820","7560900"," So I finally followed that guy. "
"7561840","7562800"," Uh, wifey's alpha."
"7563060","7566380"," I followed him on Twitter and his cool Twitter handle."
"7566380","7568040"," So I went through his Twitter handle. "
"7568180","7569440"," Smart guy knows what he's doing."
"7569920","7570920"," That seems very intelligent."
"7571580","7575780"," I'd heard stories about him in the past, but I'd never followed him. "
"7576220","7577200"," So I'd never followed him."
"7577240","7577740"," He's a great guy."
"7581250","7584250"," Just heads up that spy is neutral right now. "
"7586210","7588330"," I'm getting an alert right here that spy is neutral."
"7588690","7589610"," Let me take a look at it in the background."
"7595030","7596390"," See what's going on here with the spy. "
"7597190","7625000"," Dude, I"
"7625000","7626540"," would, I'm going to be honest with him."
"7626540","7627620"," I'll tell you guys something here."
"7627740","7627920"," Okay. "
"7630200","7633320"," Spy can explode to the upside up here."
"7633420","7633580"," Okay."
"7634320","7636040"," Be careful if you're a bear. "
"7638060","7641180"," Um, not at this exact moment, but."
"7642340","7646720"," Sometimes we save it for Friday, but if we don't, we're neutral, right?"
"7647180","7648560"," So we're in a neutral crossover."
"7649280","7651740"," I'm going to explain this to you. "
"7651740","7652000"," Okay."
"7667490","7669990"," So if this was like max bearish."
"7671710","7673450"," This is max bearish right here. "
"7674930","7676990"," We just came up to neutral."
"7679410","7685610"," We tend to do some consolidating here, but if we go, if we go up to max bullish, this is"
"7685610","7686430"," when you sell, right?"
"7687110","7690990"," If we make this trip higher, it's going to translate into a power move up here."
"7690990","7694570"," Um, so just be, just be careful with this. "
"7699890","7704250"," It's, it's, uh, of the, of the cycle of bullishness, it's extremely bullish."
"7704530","7705910"," So we'll see."
"7717290","7718310"," Yeah, not bad, right?"
"7718510","7720810"," Take a few days off, come back and it's a trend day. "
"7722590","7724410"," Good to see all of you here today, by the way."
"7728800","7731040"," I appreciate y'all inside the stream today with me."
"7731040","7734520"," Yeah, I like them. "
"7734600","7735720"," I was, um, impressed."
"7735940","7737300"," I shouldn't have followed them before."
"7744010","7745650"," Yeah, the Jim James Jameson. "
"7750300","7752000"," Hey, Sega, Hank Tastic."
"7752260","7753400"," Thanks for subscribing to one."
"7753400","7754160"," I appreciate it. "
"7755680","7756940"," You got your prime to work."
"7757120","7757740"," Hey, Chase balls."
"7757980","7758060"," Thanks. "
"7758180","7758860"," I appreciate it."
"7765380","7766580"," I miss you guys too."
"7767320","7769460"," It's been, it's been like brutally hard. "
"7769460","7773120"," Like, so when I went into Memorial, so it's, uh, you guys want that story?"
"7773340","7775280"," So I'm going into Memorial Day weekend, right?"
"7776280","7779140"," And I'm like, I'm going to put the stream up for Memorial Day."
"7780220","7781880"," Or go from Memorial Day for Friday."
"7782060","7784520"," I'm like, I'm going to put a stream up for Friday, but I'm not going to be there. "
"7784960","7788480"," I'll try to be in the office and talk to these guys at least, right?"
"7789940","7792480"," So then I'm not going to say who."
"7794680","7798800"," He's not in the stream, but a, a very high follow Twitter accounts."
"7799840","7802040"," I'm friends with outside of all of this. "
"7802240","7803800"," I'm just always been friends with him."
"7805080","7806700"," And he's like, you want to do some drinking?"
"7806920","7807400"," I'm like, fuck."
"7807560","7808300"," Yeah, I want to do some drinking. "
"7809040","7813100"," So you like called me at like, I don't know, fucking 130 in the morning or something crazy on"
"7813100","7814800"," Thursday night because the month's over, right?"
"7815040","7816040"," We're like, yeah, the month's over."
"7816180","7816760"," It's a good time."
"7817740","7819960"," And, uh, you know, all the stress is done. "
"7820260","7820780"," It's end of month."
"7821000","7825380"," It's end of fucking quarter or excuse me, end of, um, uh, excuse me."
"7828820","7829560"," Opax, right?"
"7829700","7830440"," Opax is done. "
"7830840","7834240"," Did we're supposed to do rolling into it to a long weekend?"
"7834520","7835420"," So I'm partying with him."
"7836660","7841260"," So then Friday, Friday got family come to town."
"7841300","7845720"," I've got a boat that I have to paint the bottom of it. "
"7846560","7852900"," And I'm like hung over and I'm trying to do this work from a laptop to get the stream right."
"7852900","7856960"," And people are like, you guys, some of you guys are like, move the cursor and I didn't know."
"7857060","7860120"," And I'm like, oh shit, I got to try to do this while I'm trying to deal with all this"
"7860120","7860520"," other crap. "
"7862260","7864760"," So I was having a hard time and I couldn't get my voice to talk to you guys."
"7864780","7866480"," So I'm like, all right, the weekend's done, whatever."
"7867460","7871180"," And then as the weekend progressed, uh, my brother came to town. "
"7871320","7872260"," I had some family here."
"7873640","7874900"," And my brother's a vet."
"7875540","7877900"," And so we got into it over the weekend over that. "
"7878320","7881020"," And then I'm working on the boat and the hot sun all day long, right?"
"7881020","7885080"," So I'm working on this boat and I've got, I didn't realize I've never painted the bottom of a boat."
"7886060","7887040"," And I'm like outside."
"7887620","7891900"," And the fumes from this shit is like getting like high as a kite. "
"7892280","7892900"," I'm drinking."
"7893560","7894160"," It's hot outside."
"7895920","7898700"," And of course that I'm all tired and I'm worn out and I'm loving it. "
"7898700","7901200"," And I'm like, I'm going to go ship post on Twitter over the weekend."
"7901900","7904040"," So I do all the ship posts and then Twitter over the weekend."
"7904220","7906380"," And then I'm like, oh shit, I got all this work I got to do on Twitter too. "
"7906960","7909100"," And so then of course we come into Tuesday."
"7909620","7914160"," And I tried to get on stream and I started having technical issues."
"7914880","7919560"," And then I'm, and then I'm finding out some, I have some other issues as well, uh, with website"
"7919560","7920160"," stuff. "
"7920340","7921680"," So I'm like, I got to work on all this stuff."
"7921860","7923740"," I can't get the stream up right now."
"7923740","7925400"," And yesterday I couldn't get the stream up either. "
"7925400","7930360"," I worked on it for I think two hours and still couldn't get a stream up for you."
"7930960","7935600"," As the weekend passed and I didn't stream like once I hadn't streamed for three or four days."
"7935600","7937380"," It was really weird. "
"7937620","7946300"," Like, or not Tesla, uh, my windows updated over the weekend and destroyed all of my settings on the"
"7946300","7949180"," dashboard that I have to stream for you."
"7949820","7956700"," And so between my desktops and stream labs itself wasn't working."
"7956860","7958160"," I couldn't put a live stream up. "
"7960560","7962220"," So, uh, so I'm like, well, fuck this."
"7962280","7963200"," I'm going to do all this other work."
"7963360","7964100"," It's a short week anyways. "
"7964220","7965580"," I'm like, we're already selling off."
"7965800","7966760"," I'm like, there's no point."
"7967280","7968860"," And so then I did the stream today. "
"7969540","7970540"," So we're back again."
"7971840","7973280"," Yeah, I missed you guys too."
"7975100","7978120"," Yeah, it went off, uh, it went off screen on Friday. "
"7979000","7981480"," I longed the, I longed the fuck out of that, by the way."
"7982340","7983540"," That was a good day."
"7984020","7985120"," It was a really good day. "
"7985120","7988780"," Like that morning, dude, that morning."
"7989400","7993100"," So Thursday, I bought some puts for Friday as a hedge."
"7993780","7994940"," I'm a little pissed too. "
"7995040","7996520"," This is a mixed bag here."
"7996920","7998260"," This is a really mixed bag."
"7998600","8003860"," So like Thursday and Friday, I'm like, I'm like, under normal circumstances, we should go to the"
"8003860","8004580"," fucking moon. "
"8005700","8006420"," On Friday."
"8007440","8010840"," I'm like, but they're going to try to, they're going to try a scam between Thursday and Friday."
"8010840","8012860"," So I'm like, I'm going to buy some puts for Friday. "
"8013720","8015740"," Those burned, they didn't burn, but they weren't good."
"8016200","8017940"," Closed them on the open on Friday, right?"
"8018460","8021720"," And I bought that fucking dip because if we knew we were like, oh, it's a three-trick cluster."
"8022500","8023660"," There's a four-trick cluster. "
"8023660","8024560"," We're like, it's going to the moon."
"8025680","8027300"," So we mooned, we mooned on Friday."
"8027920","8032780"," That whole time, I'm like, I'm sitting on a ton of IWM shit. "
"8033620","8034560"," Like just IWM."
"8034940","8035720"," I fucked it up."
"8035860","8036560"," I didn't buy spreads. "
"8037020","8039920"," I just bought fucking calls on IWM for late June."
"8041100","8044240"," IWM has not followed any of this."
"8045060","8050560"," And I'm like, the largest trade that I have on right now, I'm getting bent over on. "
"8051180","8053560"," I'm getting bent over sideways in this trade right now."
"8053860","8057580"," And I didn't take profit on the high and the upward channel it's in."
"8057820","8058460"," I didn't take profit. "
"8058700","8061000"," I'm like, nah, I'm waiting for 190."
"8061680","8063660"," I'm like, we'll see it definitely this week."
"8064320","8067000"," On at least IWM, like we got a big squeeze in IWM. "
"8067520","8067960"," It'll be crazy."
"8067960","8069100"," It'll take like three days."
"8069440","8070440"," It's going to go straight. "
"8070700","8072000"," It's just going to go straight north."
"8072000","8074840"," They're going to pull the hedge off it and it's going to blast north."
"8075120","8076940"," And of course that has not happened at this point. "
"8084140","8085080"," Yeah, yeah, yeah."
"8085340","8089480"," This market right here has been like pure insanity, right?"
"8090440","8094080"," And then I've got like stocks, right?"
"8094260","8094840"," They're doing great."
"8095060","8096140"," Like they're just fucking awesome. "
"8096420","8101260"," So I've got like burning fires on one side of my accounts and I've got them doing really good at"
"8101260","8102580"," another side of my account right now."
"8103420","8106300"," So it's like a really it's like a total fucking mixed bag."
"8107720","8109500"," It's a total mixed bag. "
"8109720","8110200"," All right."
"8119390","8120010"," I'm clear."
"8120190","8121230"," That's top for me right there. "
"8121270","8121550"," I'm done."
"8122230","8124130"," It's 11.39 in the afternoon."
"8125110","8125750"," I'm good. "
"8126530","8126870"," I'm flat."
"8127730","8128390"," I'm done."
"8129230","8130290"," I'll come back for more. "
"8130390","8132310"," If we can get one more rip into one 30 maybe."
"8134190","8139130"," It's only 11.39. So I really do want to see a rollback now."
"8139150","8140250"," So I'm done flat. "
"8141430","8143510"," We can see something like this at any point."
"8143650","8145610"," If we go up here and roll this back down."
"8146970","8147570"," I'm good. "
"8147790","8148110"," Flat."
"8151170","8154360"," I don't know."
"8154480","8155980"," Now I'm looking at 420s. "
"8156160","8157700"," There's only 83 cents."
"8158180","8158480"," 421."
"8159520","8159960"," 422s. "
"8160220","8161900"," 422s are 13 cents right now."
"8172140","8173040"," It's kind of juicy."
"8173740","8175900"," I'm looking at 413s for the next buy in. "
"8176280","8176760"," Oh, no."
"8177080","8177360"," Excuse me."
"8178280","8180080"," 422s for 13 cents right now. "
"8181980","8182380"," 422c."
"8182540","8183620"," They're saying we can't get up there."
"8184840","8186520"," Market makers aren't pricing that. "
"8187280","8189540"," Market makers aren't pricing us in going up there."
"8189700","8191639"," So they're telling me the fuck."
"8191760","8193540"," No, we're going to get a failure before we ever get there. "
"8202090","8203110"," I did not."
"8203570","8204190"," Hey, Matt."
"8204330","8205230"," By the way, how you been brother?"
"8207230","8208809"," I did not see it brother. "
"8209090","8212990"," Send me a meme on trade the trigger right now."
"8214969","8217490"," At trade the trigger hit me with a meme there so I can see it."
"8217629","8218750"," There's not a lot of people over there. "
"8218910","8220709"," So dude, so here's another thing."
"8221170","8221830"," Isn't that crazy?"
"8222129","8224469"," I think some like doing all this work on that trade the trigger."
"8224469","8228969"," I'm like, I'm going to create all these web hooks and set a bunch of bots and do all this"
"8228969","8237809"," stuff on this new handle so that people have consistent stuff coming to them, actionable stuff"
"8237809","8238450"," coming to them. "
"8238690","8243110"," So I'm sitting on this new handle and I'm like, because I'm on it, I'm bouncing back and forth and"
"8243110","8245209"," I'm like, dude, this is fucking awesome."
"8245770","8248549"," I'm like, it's like a whole new Twitter experience."
"8249490","8251670"," And I haven't done Twitter blue yet. "
"8251889","8255549"," So Twitter is basically like, yeah, you're just a dirt bag."
"8255730","8255990"," Nobody."
"8256090","8257610"," We're just going to send a bunch of shit your way. "
"8257629","8259309"," And I'm like, this is kind of nice right now."
"8260049","8263250"," Because like, I'm just getting a fresh feed all day long."
"8263510","8264870"," I'm like, oh, I've never seen that person before. "
"8265129","8266150"," I've never seen that person before."
"8266950","8267930"," I'm like, kind of like this."
"8268809","8276389"," I probably need to create like a Jim James handle that has zero followers and don't tell anybody. "
"8276809","8277450"," Need to do that."
"8277730","8279430"," Just like be a regular in Twitter again."
"8279830","8281490"," Or just like be a regular Twitter person again. "
"8282790","8286990"," I'd rather not like just like make my way around Twitter and be like, hey, what's going on, man?"
"8289690","8290770"," And kind of dig that."
"8299230","8320680"," Look at"
"8320680","8321440"," them up there trying to."
"8321600","8322480"," I'm like, sorry. "
"8322600","8324480"," I'm all panicky about some calls."
"8326580","8329600"," Like 4.22. So now 17 cents."
"8331620","8332500"," 18 cents. "
"8339670","8343590"," Like sometimes I'm not getting fills like something like up here."
"8343670","8348990"," Like it's like right now, right now fucking tasty works."
"8349030","8350030"," It's been a problem for me. "
"8350170","8351770"," Like I'm like, bye."
"8351830","8353770"," So, and then like, dah, fuck you."
"8353809","8354530"," We're not filling you. "
"8357969","8363730"," I mean, I love you, Matt, man."
"8363889","8364809"," I haven't seen your wild brother."
"8364950","8365690"," Hope all is well, bro. "
"8369719","8370820"," Am I a real captain?"
"8370820","8371900"," Yeah, well, I'm a sailor."
"8372520","8373719"," So yes, I am."
"8374040","8375500"," I know that people out there. "
"8376180","8377420"," You might think about like."
"8378180","8382940"," So a sailboat is a little bit different than a lot of boating."
"8383020","8383719"," It's very dangerous. "
"8384379","8385740"," It's inherently dangerous."
"8387219","8391880"," And it's kind of thing where people have to trust you."
"8392260","8397120"," And when things get crazy, you have to know what to do. "
"8399660","8406160"," And you need to perform well under pressure under very adverse sometimes."
"8408480","8409100"," Circumstances."
"8411980","8413180"," I'll leave it at that. "
"8415640","8417300"," No, it's trying to relate it to us."
"8417900","8419340"," You know, it's funny to ask that because."
"8420720","8424040"," I got swept out once in a rip current. "
"8424780","8425180"," And."
"8426920","8427580"," It's up to."
"8427760","8427920"," I guess. "
"8428880","8429280"," Jesus."
"8434200","8436720"," Thirteen cent, four twenty two straight nineteen cents."
"8437040","8438740"," Gonna get rid of this here in just a second. "
"8446390","8447210"," It's a nice street."
"8451310","8453850"," I got swept out in a rip current once."
"8454330","8455090"," So I was out. "
"8455390","8456190"," I like surfing stuff."
"8456330","8458090"," I got swept out in a rip current with no board."
"8458870","8459370"," I was. "
"8459750","8460670"," This happened."
"8462550","8463670"," On Nantucket."
"8463970","8464870"," Martha's Vineyard. "
"8464970","8465570"," I can't remember."
"8465970","8466730"," It's one of those two."
"8467150","8469310"," It was out there fucking around one night and. "
"8470030","8472150"," Swim with a swim with my now wife."
"8473330","8475110"," And my brother of all people."
"8475510","8476690"," And we got swept away. "
"8477830","8479170"," And we got swept."
"8480430","8481510"," Pretty far out."
"8481810","8483490"," Maybe a mile half mile mile. "
"8483950","8484430"," Something like that."
"8485290","8487250"," And we could have stepped out in the ocean of wealth."
"8487650","8488050"," It's an island. "
"8488810","8490330"," But we wound up hugging the coast."
"8491550","8494010"," Until the rip current dissipated."
"8495110","8496470"," We didn't fight the rip currents. "
"8496470","8497250"," We went with it."
"8498510","8502810"," But you know there's like sharks out there and you can be swept out in the ocean in a rip"
"8502810","8503550"," current as well."
"8506410","8507430"," And but we didn't panic. "
"8507650","8508410"," We actually enjoyed it."
"8508650","8509710"," Kind of just enjoyed ourselves."
"8512430","8515870"," And went with the current and fucked around and hung out. "
"8516370","8517870"," And we swam back and went."
"8518950","8521670"," I think we went down at least like a mile or two."
"8522010","8525230"," And then we had pulled out at least half mile or something in a mile. "
"8525550","8526630"," Pretty fucking far out there."
"8526710","8527250"," You couldn't see land."
"8528710","8531690"," You like barely see it over the over the water. "
"8534210","8536670"," But we we we swam back in."
"8536670","8539090"," And it's that kind of same kind of same thing."
"8539090","8542330"," You want to be able to keep people calm when stressful situations. "
"8542330","8543830"," Now I wasn't also in the military."
"8544110","8544730"," I was in the army."
"8545930","8547870"," I have that experience as well. "
"8548890","8551250"," So that's where the Captain Jim James comes from."
"8551610","8552030"," The question."
"8554210","8555310"," It's a good question. "
"8559710","8562350"," Yeah, you know, it's and you don't want to panic, right?"
"8562630","8566470"," That's the key part too is in so much swimming with it."
"8566470","8571470"," Of course it's swimming with it, but the panic is always the thing."
"8572310","8575990"," You have to be very calm under very stressful in very stressful situations. "
"8576470","8580710"," You'll be able to think clearly and make decisions that won't get somebody killed."
"8581970","8583970"," Because you can get killed in those situations, right?"
"8584930","8587090"," You can easily die in those situations."
"8588190","8590110"," You can make them fun to believe it or not. "
"8591030","8592530"," Things that are inherently dangerous."
"8593510","8594590"," No, I shouldn't say that."
"8594690","8596270"," There's some things that I don't do. "
"8596930","8598410"," Because they are inherently dangerous."
"8598690","8599610"," I like tried rock climbing."
"8600130","8600810"," I'm like fuck that. "
"8601090","8601390"," I'll die."
"8602610","8605590"," I've been offered to kite kite ski."
"8605890","8606330"," Believe it or not. "
"8606630","8607630"," No, it's not kite board."
"8607790","8611090"," My friends are kite board, but I'm not offered to learn how to kite kite ski."
"8612050","8613630"," I want nothing to do with that shit. "
"8614090","8617330"," My buddy's like, my buddy's a little kite ski and kite surf."
"8617870","8620190"," They'll go to a mountain and they'll do it over the mountain."
"8620190","8622250"," And I'm like, no, fuck that. "
"8622370","8623750"," I'm going to die doing that shit one day."
"8624050","8624810"," I'm skydiving."
"8625130","8625730"," I don't do that. "
"8627210","8629710"," I like the idea of flying."
"8630190","8630990"," I want to be the pilot."
"8631410","8632630"," I don't want to be the passenger. "
"8633130","8635550"," I want to be the master of my own death."
"8637930","8643050"," And I never felt that sense of control skydiving or rock climbing."
"8643290","8645730"," I always felt like, yeah, I could easily die doing this. "
"8648510","8652770"," For some reason, my brain is like, oh, yeah, sell out in the middle of the ocean."
"8653550","8654410"," I got that."
"8654710","8659070"," There ain't nothing taking me down with that, which is bullshit. "
"8659490","8661470"," But my brain, that's how it thinks."

"9274520","9275180"," There's no liquidity."
"9277100","9281300"," Usually not always, but you know how to squeeze there?"
"9281600","9287980"," Sometimes that can be a top, right?"
"9287980","9289020"," Where's the call wall at?"

"9812290","9817150"," We'll start running that tool together and you're never going to work again. "
"9817150","9817630"," I promise."
"9819390","9821230"," We might have to keep this group small."
"9823570","9825190"," We might have to keep this group small. "

"9843830","9844390"," You can do that. "
"9847640","9848540"," But do not."
"9850540","9852320"," You're just starting to get pulled up here."
"9855300","9858160"," Velocity is saying there is still more upside here. "
"9859160","9860360"," But we're getting close."
"9863080","9866980"," We still have not closed 42,187."
"9868980","9870140"," Somewhere up in here. "
"9870800","9874300"," You could see this move higher and then a failure in here."
"9875140","9877400"," Just be careful of that right there."
"9877920","9879580"," Somewhere in here there's some kind of a failure. "

"9921450","9922490"," Wonder bread."
"9927830","9928870"," Wonder bread."
"9933080","9935160"," I appreciate that's a gastic man. "
"9936040","9936800"," Appreciate that brother."
"9939880","9941900"," Yeah, like the masons do definitely."
"9946840","9947960"," We're going to do it together. "
"9948300","9951520"," So you're going to see me spend more time in discord."
"9952400","9955560"," You're going to see me spend more time with you specifically on the tool."
"9956080","9959080"," So if you guys are here, we're going to run that tool. "
"9959840","9962340"," We might even do some private streams."
"9964140","9966320"," Maybe I take a week off of regular streaming."
"9967040","9972300"," And if you're a member, if you have the tool, maybe I take a week off of streaming and I"
"9972300","9974720"," just stream with you privately out the whole group. "
"9977600","9982780"," So we're going to figure something out because I need a core group of people."
"9982960","9987040"," I need like a core group of like 50 to 100 people that understand this shit."
"9988080","9993760"," So if you guys understand this shit, you'll be the proof in the pudding. "
"9994620","9996560"," Now I spent a lot of time with this tool."
"9998540","10005240"," With two developers and Winky and I and Joe trading with it in the background."
"10006000","10009900"," I'm going to tell you guys something like when I'm not streaming and I'm using this tool and I'm"
"10009900","10010280"," not streaming. "
"10011860","10014420"," You can easily walk away and come back when it's ready."
"10015580","10020080"," It's going to be a fascinating part of this transition is going to be something to behold."
"10021440","10023120"," So I look forward to it. "
"10023880","10025600"," I look forward to it with you guys."
"10025880","10027720"," I think this can be life changing for you."
"10029600","10031120"," It can be life changing. "
"10038260","10038740"," Yeah."
"10043400","10044520"," I'll help anyway."
"10044740","10045860"," I love you, Winky. "
"10045860","10050580"," You know, Winky and I have been working on this tool in the background too and it's like you can"
"10050580","10051520"," see the power of it."
"10053200","10058720"," You know, you're like, I don't know what some shit I should say and some shit I shouldn't say, but"

"10061380","10064400"," You know, you're like figure out when a cell signal comes in. "
"10064500","10066340"," You can figure out when a buy signal comes in."
"10067340","10070720"," There's a few people out there that I'll be like, hey, we're going to trend today."
"10072640","10076440"," I'll tell them before the day starts, like we're going to trend today. "
"10078300","10081800"," And I don't know what I am on that, but I think it's 100% still right."
"10082140","10087500"," So you guys, when you're in the market like that, right, you can make some really good money."
"10093900","10094560"," Good job. "
"10094700","10095600"," I could put it."
"10099240","10100460"," Do we have a patreon?"

"10109100","10109980"," I don't have a patreon."
"10110620","10120440"," I've got a best way to support me is through PayPal because I know PayPal sucks."
"10120700","10124000"," I have sucks right now, but like Streamlabs takes money. "
"10124300","10125060"," YouTube takes money."
"10125420","10126060"," Twitch takes money."
"10127080","10128600"," Like they get their hands and everything. "
"10129000","10130820"," So I'll put a direct link in there."
"10131340","10136120"," If you're making money today and you want to support the stream, this helps you become a better"
"10136120","10136420"," trader."

"10765440","10770000"," Trying to close the scene of the crime."
"10770840","10776200"," We still have more scene of the crime above."
"10777060","10780740"," It actually began up there at 4.22. 99. "
"10785040","10786740"," We ain't done yet."
"10799360","10801180"," We got 4.22. 99."
"10801580","10803940"," We got another one way, way back. "
"10811200","10813020"," Look at that big boy up there."
"10813200","10814500"," I don't know why I don't have this on this."
"10814500","10829520"," But that one"
"10829520","10830360"," right there. "
"10830480","10831740"," We got that one right there."
"10831860","10833520"," And then dude, you want to see some craziness?"
"10834720","10836820"," We got all this bullshit in here."
"10837640","10839920"," We got this gap right here. "
"10841080","10842360"," Here's a gap for you."
"10843240","10845840"," We got Gap City above."
"10848260","10849440"," Gaps right there. "
"10850580","10854820"," That's 4.41. That's the one that I was talking about with the Wackoff."

"10889780","10892820"," 4.25.25 above right there. "
"10893560","10897580"," Now this one right here on minimum."
"10899500","10902760"," We just return to the scene of crime right here."
"10903740","10906920"," And then we just have the top of the previous high up here. "
"10907480","10908380"," This is important."
"10910580","10922080"," A close above is foolish"
"10922080","10922500"," right?"
"10923680","10933640"," The scene of"
"10933640","10936080"," the crime is right here."
"10944890","10946850"," You're going to hear people come out. "
"10946850","10950810"," And they're going to tell you."
"10954520","10962680"," We failed to close above right here."
"10962680","10968840"," They have a failure close above 4.22.99. That's a double top. "
"10969040","10969900"," They're going to tell you."
"10970080","10971200"," They're going to tell you it's a double top."
"10975510","10977010"," They're going to tell you to short this. "
"10978510","10979850"," Double top on the spine."
"10980850","10985170"," There's something else neat about this as well with that horrible breath that's in the market."
"10986570","10991790"," So on a one hour chart right here for our chart right here. "
"10993810","10995990"," This is very much like 2021."
"10998690","11001470"," Very much like 2020 to some extent."
"11002370","11005710"," But it's just that relentless grind higher. "
"11008190","11011350"," So when you make that relentless grind higher."
"11012610","11014430"," It's just like boom."
"11015230","11015310"," Boom. "
"11018450","11024490"," Can we get 4.26 today or tomorrow?"
"11027850","11029210"," Can we get it?"
"11031470","11032690"," Slam down."
"11033550","11034190"," Powerful move."
"11035010","11035830"," Powerful move. "
"11036210","11036810"," Powerful move."
"11036810","11039950"," And explosive move up here."
"11045310","11047910"," Can we rip faces off into Friday?"
"11050610","11052670"," Can we get that window dressing?"
"11054130","11055770"," And then sell June. "
"11057250","11058910"," Well sell me I guess."
"11070260","11073820"," From all the videos I saw last night, man."
"11073820","11078900"," From all the interviews I saw the past two days. "
"11080780","11082960"," I bet they're still short aren't they?"
"11083280","11083640"," No."
"11085300","11088600"," Probably saw Captain Jim James go on to it this morning."
"11090140","11091320"," Say we're going up. "
"11091620","11094300"," They're probably like oh shit I just did an interview yesterday."
"11101960","11105840"," I just made this video man about breath sucking."
"11108400","11115720"," I just made a video about mania. "
"11118880","11128540"," This is the sexy one right here isn't it?"
"11129100","11131820"," This is the one that all the bears are watching."
"11132060","11135360"," The bears are like we don't want to close above here."
"11135480","11136040"," We don't want that. "
"11136260","11137500"," We don't even want the tag."
"11138880","11140280"," Bears want failure."
"11143160","11144880"," They don't care about the scene of the crime. "
"11144880","11145660"," They're like yeah whatever."
"11145900","11147540"," If you've seen the crime make a bear happy."
"11147960","11149380"," They don't care about the scene of the crime. "
"11150340","11154300"," They care about getting above the scene of the crime."
"11155520","11159260"," Closing above the previous eye and what it means."
"11168510","11170150"," We want to share something else right here. "
"11171410","11173470"," Maybe asking yourself are we bullish here?"
"11174350","11175770"," Are we not bullish here?"
"11179480","11181040"," We had some crosses earlier."
"11181040","11185780"," Someone in stream earlier pointed out nicely said hey is that?"
"11186640","11190140"," Is that a bear a plane and I go yeah it is but."
"11191760","11193900"," I was like we have velocity on our side. "
"11194200","11196260"," We're at a three trigger cluster that's bullish."
"11197640","11200860"," And so why did I disregard that earlier in the stream?"
"11201480","11203200"," We're going to talk about why that is right now."
"11212580","11214120"," Where can we go right now?"
"11214380","11215160"," Are we still bullish?"
"11215400","11216320"," All big questions right?"
"11217040","11220080"," Where can we go right now?"
"11224850","11225850"," Just right here right?"
"11226070","11230310"," We were like bearish neutral crossover. "
"11230950","11234810"," How bullish can we get?"
"11235090","11236390"," We can get quite bullish can't we?"
"11237050","11238790"," What happens when we get quite bullish?"
"11239610","11243230"," We do something like this here or even just right here."
"11244410","11245350"," What happens?"
"11245350","11248410"," We explode to the upside."
"11251310","11254430"," So if this is just our initial move right here. "
"11256170","11259410"," Is this what is the expectation?"
"11261090","11268930"," Well the expectation would be an explosive move to the upside."
"11273580","11276620"," What does that channel have us targeting up there?"
"11278420","11281120"," A channel has us targeting you ready for this?"
"11282680","11284140"," 426 right here."
"11285560","11286160"," 428. "
"11287180","11287640"," 426."
"11288920","11291500"," If we trade it sideways in a tomorrow how about 430 close?"
"11291800","11293220"," What the creepy crawly in a Friday close?"
"11294420","11294940"," Here's your 430."
"11295840","11297680"," June 1st boom done. "
"11298800","11300500"," Can that happen right now it can?"
"11301920","11305720"," Right now we're a little frosty on the 1 in 5 minute."
"11305920","11307300"," So I'm going to expect to pull back here."
"11309780","11311860"," Right here right around here we expect to pull back. "
"11312060","11313960"," We get a little long in the tooth to the upside."
"11315520","11318700"," So just by looking at but we're not long in the tooth in the hourly."
"11318960","11322220"," So I can take a few things from that. "
"11328140","11331600"," I can say yeah the 1 in 5 minute."
"11332140","11333180"," This one right here."
"11333900","11335460"," And that one right there. "
"11335880","11337560"," They're a little long in the tooth."
"11338420","11339560"," But the hourly is not."
"11340360","11341480"," And guess what we just started?"
"11342500","11343380"," Another hour. "
"11344160","11349540"," So even though the 1 in the 5 minute is a little long in the tooth it's 1232 in the"
"11349540","11349860"," afternoon."
"11351960","11358080"," So we're either going to get really viciously bullish here just based on the hourly and just run"
"11358080","11358560"," higher."
"11359240","11363740"," Or we're going to at least come back and check out the 1 and the 2 for the 1 in"
"11363740","11364080"," the 5."
"11365160","11370540"," And then hope for that 1 in 5 minute check and that rip faces off to get up there to"
"11370540","11382510"," that 4.22.99. And I don't think that it's that difficult to even imagine a consolidation"
"11382510","11392420"," move up in a 4.24 or 4.26. Leaving"
"11392420","11395040"," it even imagining here is not off the table. "
"11395860","11397600"," And the hourly is extremely bullish."
"11398120","11407960"," So 1232 you're looking for a dip to buy in this hour between 1230 and 130 you're"
"11407960","11409040"," looking for a dip to buy."
"11410820","11415620"," And I'd like to see a recheck of at least the at least the white line and possibly the red"
"11415620","11415920"," line. "
"11418600","11420020"," I'm going to leave one right here."
"11421200","11422980"," And make this one right here white."
"11426320","11432960"," And the red one was a little long too so this one right here. "
"11436960","11438420"," I'll just draw it out for you."
"11441380","11443860"," We'll look for a minimum of a test right here."
"11447460","11449880"," Possibly kind of consolidation here. "
"11451180","11452820"," And then a real retest down here."
"11454540","11456360"," That looks really shitty doesn't it?"
"11456960","11457940"," It doesn't look good."
"11460200","11465680"," So it's 1230 right we mark the hour that here's 1230 right here. "
"11466340","11468300"," So just somewhere down in here."
"11482620","11484820"," Right some like that get underneath it."
"11485200","11486940"," This rolls over a little bit. "
"11487780","11489700"," Try to make another move of higher here."
"11491160","11492820"," Now saying all this."
"11494020","11498440"," If we successfully test the twenty twenty one EMA. "
"11501940","11505200"," We might just continue higher so we're going to watch the interplay here."
"11505200","11509860"," See what happens if we begin to make new highs on the fifteen minute."
"11510360","11511920"," We're probably not even going to look back. "
"11512080","11513020"," We're never going to look down here."
"11513920","11516280"," So we'll see what happens right now."
"11516340","11518160"," We're just going to pay attention to it. "
"11518600","11521820"," See if we begin to break below this one minute and go to check."
"11522260","11523160"," This should be read right now."
"11526600","11527960"," This is our color coordination. "
"11534320","11535660"," So you can see it right here."
"11536400","11537780"," There's what I get underneath."
"11539380","11541680"," Right and start to sell this down right here. "
"11546290","11547430"," If we successfully."
"11549270","11549790"," Hold."
"11550690","11553250"," You'll see this right here. "
"11553850","11555550"," And we'll enter some calls right in here."
"11564930","11566330"," Four twenty three."
"11579410","11581050"," So we're going to pay close attention to this. "
"11588230","11589590"," Put that over there for you."
"11592670","11594530"," We'll see if this holds or not."
"11595090","11596250"," If we begin to run again. "
"11600460","11601620"," I'll re-enter one more time with you."
"11601960","11603760"," I got no problem going up there."
"11604700","11606260"," I got no fear going up there. "
"11606440","11607280"," So if we can go up there we will."
"11607840","11609080"," Looks like some supplies coming in."
"11609200","11610440"," Be careful of this right here. "
"11611880","11615700"," I want you to see these sellers that just show themselves right there."
"11615700","11616620"," Four twenty three."
"11617580","11619440"," These sellers are trying to come in right here. "
"11630600","11632500"," You're going to take yourself out to a fancy lunch."
"11632500","11633520"," Very nice, very nice."
"11634040","11636460"," Spike like saying a bare plane is forming right now. "
"11636780","11638280"," You can see this yellow and white line."
"11639040","11642580"," You can see we're losing a little bit of velocity to the upside right now."
"11642740","11646620"," We also know that the one in five minute velocity is topping out. "
"11649140","11650440"," Are we looking for a tag?"
"11651000","11655200"," A tag tag below here to the five minute check if the way is still up."
"11730390","11733930"," These beers are getting all beared up here like."
"11761000","11764300"," Yeah, the earlier is saying the move is up. "
"11764780","11768300"," The one in the five minute right now are probably looking for check backs."
"11768520","11769020"," But that's it."
"11776760","11778560"," I'm expecting us to be up there. "
"11778740","11782480"," So hopefully we can get like a liquid."
"11782700","11789500"," I would really like to see like liquidation break and it get bought right back up, something like"
"11789500","11789700"," that."
"11789900","11796440"," And then whoop, I'd really like to see like a really super fast liquidation break and not. "
"11796660","11799000"," I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't"
"11799000","11799000"," want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to"
"11799000","11799000"," see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this"
"11799000","11799000"," five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute"
"11799000","11799000"," turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I"
"11799000","11799000"," don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this five minute turn, I don't want"
"11799000","11800100"," to see this five minute turn, I don't want to see this but I don't want to see it, what"
"11800100","11804740"," I hate seeing, so let's show you guys something here so you guys got this okay."
"11805700","11813340"," When you see like when you see the any any line going straight up, it's very bullish right, same"
"11813340","11817000"," thing on the way down, any line going straight down is very very bearish right."
"11817640","11825580"," Whenever you see the sideways, it's not so bad, it's not bad per se, but the more we're done going"
"11825580","11835300"," up, the more time we spend sideways, the aggressiveness to the move the upside starts to go"
"11835300","11842600"," away and we'll tend to want to then check the next one down here, we don't want to see this"
"11842600","11850160"," red line go sideways either, I want to like, I want to like start moving up or quick move down"
"11850160","11855580"," to check to make sure that buyers are still there, and we don't want to see like flattening,"
"11855580","11863560"," flattening that kind of nonsense, that you can see the momentum is starting to slow down, let's"
"11863560","11869580"," look at where the hourly is because we know that the hourly is extremely bullish, the hourly"
"11869580","11873940"," though, this is where this we call this like the smart money, right, right?"
"11874640","11877020"," They're at $4.892 right now. "
"11878380","11880140"," So the smart money is right here."
"11883660","11890660"," So if you had smart money in the market right now, you're like a bull and you're like, I'm right"
"11890660","11892940"," here trying to buy right here, right?"
"11894660","11901360"," And then you've got here, these people are these people still here, right?"
"11901360","11906160"," Are these buyers still willing, do these buyers believe we're going higher or not?"
"11906900","11912060"," Okay, if those buyers don't believe we're going higher, do these buyers think we have enough"
"11912060","11913020"," momentum to go up?"
"11914740","11916180"," So right now, I think we do."
"11916340","11917340"," I don't think it's right here. "
"11917480","11918380"," I think it's down lower."
"11919020","11921080"," I think these buyers are exhausted."
"11921500","11922860"," These buyers are exhausted. "
"11924540","11928560"," And I think that we actually go, I don't think we get out here, pass out."
"11928740","11929220"," Maybe we could."
"11929220","11932040"," But I think the buyers are right here. "
"11932620","11934800"," I think the buyers believe we can go higher here."
"11934980","11936300"," So that minimum."
"11936680","11938360"," So if I can get this dip, I will. "
"11939260","11943340"," If we were to rip faces off, rip faces off from right here, that wouldn't shock me either."
"11943400","11946160"," So I think buyers know we can go higher."
"11948340","11951800"," So it's just a matter of, it's a matter of, do they show up or do they not show up?"
"11952580","11954420"," Do the buyers show up is the question. "
"12062800","12063400"," Let me know in the chat."
"12063580","12067080"," Do you think that there's, you know, sometimes you're like, yeah, there's no demand here."
"12067880","12068800"," Let me know in the chat. "
"12070160","12077860"," Maybe we could make a, we could make a, we"
"12077860","12085820"," could make a, what do you call it, a poll and ask."
"12086660","12091200"," Do you think that there's demand for calls here at 421.50?"
"12091200","12094140"," Do you think there's demand for calls below?"
"12094440","12095280"," You have to do that one just to."
"12096080","12099160"," Is the demand for calls on the white, the red or the green?"
"12100220","12101340"," Where is the demand?"
"12104240","12105480"," I'm going to go with red. "
"12107580","12109620"," I know the smart money is down here in green."
"12110460","12111700"," That's probably your best answer."
"12112460","12128750"," But do you think"
"12128750","12134130"," the red, yeah, white, green or red, I guess that's the answer. "
"12134130","12135310"," Where is demand?"
"12135830","12136410"," White, green or red?"
"12138330","12146690"," I think it's higher, like in a normal day I would say it's probably a green, but a normal day"
"12146690","12149150"," I would say green, but I think we're going to see it on red."
"12150650","12153630"," I don't know that it's that far down, maybe it is."
"12155370","12156330"," I think it's on red. "
"12159670","12163350"," I think it's higher than usual, but I could be wrong."
"12163350","12165730"," If I'm wrong, call me wrong."
"12167610","12170710"," If you think it's on the green, Mitch, yeah, we should do the poll. "
"12171110","12175290"," The green, I have a lot of respect for anyone that says green because it's a normal fucking day I'd"
"12175290","12176670"," be like, yeah, it's green, definitely."
"12182030","12182730"," Let me give it out."
"12182850","12184270"," Let me check something else here in the background. "
"12186550","12191290"," Let me check one second here."
"12206270","12223740"," Sometimes, it's not too much higher for 1909, it's like"
"12223740","12225880"," 419.91, it's somewhere down here."
"12233680","12241500"," I think this is crucial up here, so I think we're going to wrap this shit up for end of"
"12241500","12242580"," month and all that kind of stuff. "
"12242740","12245160"," We're going to wrap up the spy and try to get up there and close those gaps."
"12246120","12247760"," We have to get this close here."
"12249620","12256800"," I'm assuming that there are some of you out there that think we'll do it on Friday, but I don't"
"12256800","12258260"," think that's how it goes on Friday. "
"12258980","12260940"," I think it's done today."
"12261900","12263880"," I think that trade is done today."
"12267890","12289390"," It's crazy too, as we've got all these puts on the 14th, 16th in there, but then on the 15th,"
"12289410","12298550"," I'm like, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th,"
"12298550","12298550"," I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going"
"12298550","12298650"," to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap"

"12299870","12301530"," for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the"
"12301530","12310560"," 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the"
"12310560","12314960"," 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm"
"12314960","12334200"," going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to"
"12334200","12345420"," wrap it up in the 15th, I'm"
"12345420","12345940"," going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th of the 15th,"
"12345940","12345940"," I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going"

"12348680","12350980"," break it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it up for the 15th, I'm going to wrap it"
"12350980","12351780"," 39 in the afternoon. "
"12353340","12355440"," Cocaine lunch time for Wall Street."
"12356400","12357540"," Not quite at 130."
"12358000","12358820"," You guys know what it is. "
"12360300","12361980"," You know that middle of the daytime."
"12365100","12367700"," So these Wall Streeters, they have what?"
"12368080","12369160"," 1249 like 130."
"12370120","12375880"," We've got 40 minutes left for the bulls to get up here. "
"12377500","12378380"," 40 minutes."
"12390600","12393360"," And bulls have already lost the 15 minute."
"12394180","12396440"," So bears have won the first 15 minutes. "
"12399340","12401300"," We'll see if they go in the next 15 minutes."
"12471190","12471870"," Give me that."
"12472070","12473870"," Give me that scene of the crime, baby. "
"12531020","12532940"," Scene of the crime up here."
"12536880","12539560"," Long in the tooth on the spy."
"12579640","12581880"," Bulls want to get the clothes above. "
"12584930","12586410"," Even if they just touch it."
"12597610","12599130"," Someone's at the front doorbell."
"12655300","12657080"," I'd appreciate their dark helmet. "
"12658040","12659840"," Yeah, it's a little long in the tooth here."
"12660020","12663340"," Like personally, you shouldn't be starting longs here."
"12664180","12666960"," There's a high probability of a roll over here. "
"12669340","12671760"," The five minutes catching up right now."
"12672100","12674700"," My question here is this stuff up here."
"12676620","12682320"," My question is there's still velocity of velocity move to the upside. "
"12683240","12685220"," But it might take some time to get there."
"12686720","12691220"," It's important because of like the scene of the crime is critical for a bull."
"12691820","12695980"," If you get the double top here, you're going to get cell sites going to come right in and be"
"12695980","12698040"," like, we're going to hammer this shit down in the next week. "
"12698860","12699820"," I'm going to hammer it down tomorrow."
"12700940","12704300"," So just technically algorithms, all that kind of stuff they need to get up here."
"12707200","12712740"," This clothes above bullish, they really need that like end of day today, maybe even tomorrow. "
"12715300","12718420"," You get that window dressing."
"12719720","12720980"," Start selling June."
"12728370","12731090"," That's selling June, but you know, like you're wrapping up May. "
"12731750","12733310"," Like we didn't excel in May, right?"
"12733710","12740030"," We had what 30% of the stock market had lows, or 60% of the stock market had selling"
"12740030","12743290"," May already, right?"
"12743710","12746430"," So we've got some selling of May has already taken place."
"12746750","12749450"," You already know that a lot of the big tickers are carrying the market."
"12750570","12755410"," But if you look on breath on, if you look on breath on a lot of the S&P 500,"
"12756390","12758530"," those sectors got destroyed. "
"12759610","12760810"," You can actually look at oil, right?"
"12761130","12764470"," Oil was in the dumpster fire, and it's it's burned all day long today."
"12765990","12771930"," So you're watching some rotation into the May sectors that got run over."
"12772310","12774750"," I'm going to give you a couple of those sectors right now. "
"12774750","12777350"," See if I can or actually I can't right now."
"12777810","12779590"," But you want to keep your eyes on."
"12780110","12781690"," You know, we're coming into bond season. "
"12781770","12787050"," You know that we're going to do some rotation into some of these sectors as we head into June."
"12792390","12794030"," Yeah, me and be a Y right now."
"12806600","12807220"," Oh, yeah. "
"12807480","12807940"," Oh, yeah."
"12808060","12810180"," And be a Y is about to explode higher, too."
"12810900","12811380"," Did it weekend?"
"12811700","12819760"," I meant to tell you that this morning I was looking at the, oh, look at the, at the stock"
"12819760","12820060"," picks. "
"12821500","12825900"," Every single one of them, dude, was on like a cluster to rip faces off today."
"12826600","12828460"," Not every one of them, but close to every one of them."
"12829340","12830160"," You ready for this?"
"12831480","12832520"," You guys ready for this?"
"12832840","12838680"," How many tickers is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13?"
"12840580","12846800"," First ticker, up four percent, next ticker, three percent, next ticker, four point, six percent,"
"12847600","12854100"," next ticker, three percent, next ticker, point five percent, go one ticker minus one percent, but I"

"12872200","12873620"," was like, like, damn it."
"12875580","12879080"," I was like, we should, I was like, we should, I was like, we should be looking at these things"
"12879080","12879700"," every day. "
"12879880","12880880"," Well, do we're going to do that?"
"12881060","12882420"," We used to get this tool out to everybody."
"12883060","12886440"," We're going to look at these tickers every day so we can, when once the alerts start rolling in and"
"12886440","12887600"," being like, this is where we buy right here."
"12889860","12891240"," Cheers, thanks for coming to a member, brother. "
"12891420","12891820"," Appreciate it."
"12893320","12894600"," John Klopp, take it easy, brother."

"12915500","12918320"," 30 seconds, we should roll lower. "
"12920200","12924800"," We should roll here, get one more, it's not, we're still in that one and that candle."
"12925020","12929880"," So, we're going to know, right, if we don't get a new high, a new high off 4.21, we'll"
"12929880","12930820"," get a new high right here."

"12964800","12965440"," I love it. "
"12966060","12966700"," I love it."
"12966800","12972100"," I spent a lot of time and following other streamers, hated trading alone."
"12973240","12976380"," And I can't like CNBC, fucking useless. "
"12976840","12983120"," Fox business, I'm not a fan of Fox and news, but Fox business news or the financial channels, I"
"12983120","12983720"," like that one."
"12984680","12988160"," But it's not directly directly related to what you're doing."
"12989480","12999580"," I used to really like listening to the guy that's on the guy that's on, I"
"12999580","13000700"," think, or swim. "
"13002040","13004520"," I forget his name, but he was never on long enough."
"13004920","13009820"," He was only on like two hours in the morning and then I'd be like, I felt like, I'd be"
"13009820","13014880"," like, damn it, I needed somebody else in the background and not having somebody."
"13018320","13019680"," Yeah, no new hi there. "
"13020500","13021860"," No new hi."
"13022260","13024700"," See that 12th, the sixth was 1230."
"13028860","13030460"," There's 1230 right there. "
"13030740","13031600"," We can bring this down."
"13033080","13034260"," Right there."
"13038280","13040160"," It's like, I like having somebody beside me. "
"13040680","13043980"," And the other thing though, I tell people this sometimes I'm like, I'm like, we have somebody"
"13043980","13044840"," sitting beside me."
"13044840","13049800"," I'm not really looking for I'm not really looking for like people fist pump in each other."
"13049860","13054960"," I'm not looking for someone that's speaking in tongues over complicated concepts. "
"13055960","13061660"," I'm not looking for somebody that I'm like, have to think or like do some research at that moment"
"13061660","13061980"," or something."
"13062160","13066080"," I just want somebody next week to talk to me hanging out with who I'm trading."
"13067420","13069420"," The same thing is like listening to music. "
"13070280","13071620"," Sometimes like listening to music."
"13071840","13075480"," Sometimes I like, I don't like listening to like audio books when I trade."
"13076200","13080200"," But it's like music or someone that's in the market, even if I'm trading something different, like"
"13080200","13083740"," somebody just talking in the background, like you and I were actually sitting in a room. "
"13085600","13087640"," No new high for the spy."
"13089040","13091560"," Expecting a role here down to 4 20 76."
"13094300","13095100"," Hey, grubster. "
"13095220","13095640"," How you doing brother?"
"13098140","13098840"," You been telling?"
"13099020","13100620"," You been cleaning empty houses?"
"13101500","13103880"," Dude, we used to pay big money for that."
"13105800","13110620"," Dude, grubster saying that he was cleaning empty houses, right?"
"13111600","13112680"," You know what's big money dude?"
"13113380","13114180"," Construction cleanups."
"13116700","13119240"," You know what the cool part about construction cleanups are?"
"13121060","13125840"," It's like higher people coming to clean up like the windows and vacuum and all that kind of stuff. "
"13126360","13131660"," If you get yourself with a developer, they will hire you for all their stuff."
"13131900","13137060"," It's like, I might hire you like one house or something, but while it's cleaners, they'll go and"
"13137060","13138220"," like work for a developer."
"13139040","13147720"," They make bank bank like a lot of money and they just like hitting them, bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"13148180","13150320"," And so I was like, can you clean my house?"
"13150340","13151680"," They're like, no, we don't do that."
"13152260","13152920"," And I was like, why?"
"13153100","13154360"," And they're like, because people are there."
"13154620","13155440"," And I was like, what do you mean?"
"13155560","13161080"," They're like, it's like just like painters like painters don't like painting occupied interior"
"13161080","13161540"," homes. "
"13162160","13168320"," They love painting for investors, because they're like, they roll in, nobody's in there, no"
"13168320","13169260"," furniture, no people."
"13169680","13170900"," Five minutes to now you can get a room painted."
"13175130","13179410"," Yeah, just some guy too is saying as a developer, a cleanup crew that is reliable, pay good, money"
"13179410","13180610"," worth, weight and gold, absolutely. "
"13182810","13186330"," And if they come when you need them, it's like, like, it's done right."
"13187590","13190090"," They'll, they'll, they'll just give you all their work."
"13191110","13193470"," That's a great small business to start. "
"13197770","13198730"," STT Voyager."
"13204060","13204840"," Yeah, here."
"13205340","13206840"," Yeah, still no bare plane here. "
"13209120","13211700"," Be like, that's a great job."
"13211880","13214860"," Like I'm like, damn it, man, that's a great small company."
"13216640","13219020"," Small business, just do construction cleanups. "
"13219700","13221820"," And this isn't like cleaning up the construction waste."
"13222640","13224000"," Like you don't do any of that stuff."
"13224940","13231960"," You're like, it's all the dirt, the dust, the debris, all the fine parking, like vacuuming, air"
"13231960","13236560"," filtration, sometimes clean the windows, make sure the place is presentable. "
"13237180","13238660"," And they usually need it done, right?"
"13239740","13240220"," Done."
"13240660","13246740"," And if you're reliable, like reliable, something about being reliable and like, if you're reliable"
"13246740","13248700"," and get your work done, you will get paid."
"13250040","13251460"," You will, you command it. "
"13252040","13257800"," Because when you have like bad experiences, you're like, I'm going to cheap out over here."
"13257860","13258840"," I'm going to cheap out over there."
"13259540","13262820"," Eventually you get burned and you go, fuck this, I'm just going to pay. "
"13262940","13264580"," If I find someone that's good, I'm going to pay them."
"13267060","13275040"," You know, that's what you're doing with your grunts."
"13275220","13278820"," Even if you're a grunt, what do you do?"
"13279140","13281620"," Like, I guess let's tie it like, how would you start that business?"
"13282000","13288180"," I guess your thing would be take pictures of your work as a grunt, like snap some good photos of"
"13288180","13289160"," the stuff that you're doing. "
"13290260","13297460"," And then the big one that I would say is, whatever the boss is and looking, you know, get to"
"13297460","13299500"," know somebody that's the point of contact there."
"13299980","13304780"," Hey, Bob, thanks for having us on your job site today."
"13305800","13308840"," And then find out who that guy is, like what company does he own?"
"13311200","13311780"," You know?"
"13313580","13317360"," And then the key one here would be to find a real estate group. "
"13318280","13321860"," Probably get onto like a, it's like where I live."
"13322440","13326480"," The only thing I use Facebook for it, where I live, is a real estate investors group."
"13328620","13333220"," And I'll go in there and say, oh, I need a furnace cleaned, or oh, I need this done. "
"13333300","13334040"," I need a blonde mode."
"13335100","13337160"," And there's there's contractors in there."
"13337860","13339980"," And they'll be like, hey, man, I'm Olans. "
"13340300","13341140"," And I'm like, okay, great."
"13341700","13342360"," When can you do it?"
"13342600","13343060"," How much is it?"
"13343900","13344560"," Come on over into it."
"13345140","13348360"," And all these real estate investors know who the good contractors are. "
"13348420","13351040"," So that's an easy way right there."
"13352100","13358520"," If Facebook, Facebook real estate investors group, then you pick up what you probably only need"
"13358520","13361540"," like five, 10, 15 clients, dude."
"13362220","13363340"," And the money is yours. "
"13364920","13365600"," Don't cheap out."
"13366220","13367980"," If you're a good worker, don't cheap out."
"13368060","13372620"," If you do good work, quality work, and you're always there, I wouldn't go crazy high like"
"13372620","13379940"," reasonable, but if you're good at what you do, you can easily make 50 bucks an hour or 100 bucks"
"13379940","13380560"," an hour easy. "
"13388380","13392480"," Yeah, property management firms like Avenue five and table rock, they all keep it as a single point"
"13392480","13394360"," of contact contact for unit turnover."
"13394740","13395560"," That's good money too."
"13401180","13402820"," Ooh, that by the dip, baby. "
"13408150","13412890"," I know someone of you guys out there is like looking for that roll here."
"13419430","13421370"," Let's do some bear porn here for the bears."
"13422470","13426890"," Bears are like all I'm waiting for. "
"13431340","13434840"," There's like all I'm waiting for is that big cross up here."
"13437900","13440740"," Just waiting for that big old roll right there."
"13441920","13443080"," This is the bears looking for. "
"13444940","13448360"," Bears look like waiting for that big bad boy right there."
"13449100","13454720"," Failure, grab some breath of fresh air and bloodbath in the stock market right down there."
"13455120","13459440"," That bears looking for that trade is not for you until that happens. "
"13459800","13469900"," So bears like"
"13469900","13472140"," I want to take all this back on a Thursday."
"13472820","13473740"," Look at that shit."
"13477240","13478720"," Let me know if you buy inputs here. "
"13479060","13479640"," I can see it."
"13479940","13481100"," I see which bears are saying."
"13482060","13483820"," I know this is your setup right here. "
"13484940","13490830"," Yeah, I want to see this one right here is still going hard."
"13491050","13493230"," This one still here still hasn't flattened yet."
"13494250","13496510"," You need to, bulls need to lose the hourly. "
"13497030","13499910"," It's 108, bulls have 22 more minutes."
"13508670","13510210"," Not in anything right now."
"13511490","13514670"," I am looking to possibly buy a dip if it presents itself. "
"13520380","13520840"," Vicks."
"13523760","13525820"," Yeah, you know, I could buy a put here."
"13526580","13527000"," Let me see. "
"13530920","13532520"," Vicks got destroyed."
"13537850","13539770"," I can see buying puts here."
"13541690","13542350"," How much are they?"
"13542410","13542650"," They're cheap?"
"13543230","13544170"," 420s or 15 cents?"
"13545150","13545830"," Oh, yeah. "
"13545970","13547310"," Do you can't resist that, can you?"
"13568500","13570100"," Puts are dirt cheap right now."
"13571140","13572860"," Commence some 420Ps."
"13575040","13602450"," The guy"
"13602450","13608450"," says he wants to buy Vicks here because he thinks it could skyrocket soon. "
"13610750","13611930"," Yeah, I think it could skyrocket."
"13613290","13614130"," Like owning the Vicks."
"13614270","13615830"," What about the contract?"
"13616250","13616930"," What does he want to buy?"
"13617030","13617350"," Vicks futures?"
"13620290","13621350"," I don't know what he wants. "
"13621790","13623290"," How does he want to express that trade?"
"13623490","13626190"," You don't have really good traders here is put spread."
"13626930","13628550"," He thinks Vicks is going to skyrocket."
"13629090","13630090"," I'm going to get stopped now right now. "
"13632550","13634170"," Please don't stop me out of these puts."
"13642340","13645260"," Right now where we are, just get some put spreads, man."
"13645420","13646020"," We're at 421. "
"13647660","13649460"," So get some put spreads."
"13649820","13653960"," If we trade 426 and roll over there, it's no brainer, right?"
"13654440","13656860"," If you think the Vicks is going to skyrocket, just some put spreads."
"13657780","13659080"," I think a great idea. "
"13660140","13661440"," So it doesn't do options."
"13666520","13668360"," I'm trying to watch my trade right now."
"13669120","13670800"," I'm going to get stopped out here. "
"13677400","13678700"," It doesn't do options."
"13680220","13690140"," It doesn't do"
"13690140","13690920"," options."
"13693060","13694960"," It only does underline. "
"13696460","13701080"," Nope, they're going to stop me out."
"13702700","13704640"," They're going to squeeze me the fuck out here."
"13732260","13733980"," Yep, I just got stopped out of the penny. "
"13740040","13740740"," Flat again."
"13743280","13745920"," Do you think the Vicks is going to go up a ton?"
"13746300","13747620"," So now that I'm flat, I can think about this."
"13751090","13752270"," Why not just buy oil?"
"13753790","13758250"," I don't know if I buy oil right now, but why not just buy oil if I think they're going"
"13758250","13758750"," to go up a ton?"
"13767160","13769080"," HYG blasting up right now. "
"13769760","13770900"," Trying to close the gap above."
"13772840","13774720"," I don't know, man, that I could do that."
"13775300","13779540"," I think USO oil would have been a perfect buy in the open this morning. "
"13785360","13786840"," Yeah, I just got stopped out."
"13787120","13796680"," I had puts for $0.16. They had to stop at $0.15. I'm not willing to get torched on"
"13796680","13797180"," puts here."
"13798280","13803260"," Someone just texted me saying dealers trying to entice bears and to go in short again here. "
"13803420","13804480"," Oh, yeah, they totally are."
"13807360","13808320"," What would I do?"
"13808840","13809560"," Common stock."
"13813240","13818640"," I don't like it's always better to, so I'm being asked to question the background. "
"13819340","13822000"," The guy says he wants to buy Vicks here."
"13823160","13826300"," I'm not anti that."
"13827160","13829960"," You'll find out which contracts you buy in. "
"13831220","13834080"," I always like, man, Vicks dude."
"13834240","13838980"," I don't like expressing it elsewhere."
"13841020","13843520"," I can't recommend that trade. "
"13844920","13845880"," Put spreads."
"13847220","13848840"," So basic and so easy."
"13852300","13855140"," Put spread for late June. "
"13856600","13858680"," Something that's like 420 to 425."
"13860080","13861120"," Late June."
"13862200","13862820"," It's a nice trade. "
"13865780","13873580"," I think we can easily rip to 423 or 422, excuse me, 422.30 and even higher."
"13875080","13880100"," This 423 is easy and even 426 by Friday is easy."
"13885630","13893890"," Yeah, like, Vicks is the weird thing, right?"
"13895370","13898450"," I think it's always timing. "
"13912350","13913470"," What's my win?"
"13913690","13915810"," I don't do Estau."
"13916110","13916830"," I love Estau."
"13917310","13917890"," That's a good one. "
"13918070","13919490"," Whoever called out Estau."
"13920610","13921970"," I like Estau."
"13923250","13924330"," Owning Estau is fun. "
"13925570","13926110"," That's a good one."
"13932120","13935220"," Now that's when it gains losses percentage like out of number of trades."
"13936800","13940880"," When I was not streaming, I did very well. "
"13942180","13948460"," I was making mid six figures not trading often."
"13949080","13953460"," I have a much higher loss rate day trading with you guys on stream."
"13954620","13958140"," That's mostly because someone always wants to trade. "
"13961020","13963300"," With that set, I've become a better trader."
"13965300","13975260"," But most of my money is made from buying stock or buying call spreads on trend days or trend days"
"13975260","13975720"," like this."
"13975800","13976480"," I make a lot of money. "
"13976760","13982560"," I have a high win rate generally, yeah."
"13983360","13987040"," And I have a high multiple win rate, like 200%, 300% like this stuff."
"13988100","13989180"," But nowhere near. "
"13989480","13990260"," I don't make as much."
"13991340","13999780"," I'm barely breaking coming on about 100 grand or $150,000 a year."
"14000260","14001460"," It used to be about 500. "
"14002460","14003220"," Not as much anymore."
"14004420","14005500"," I'm upset about it."
"14006520","14008380"," So I need to do less trading. "
"14009220","14010220"," It's a part of streaming."
"14016040","14019620"," Heads up if you are a member of trade station."
"14019620","14020600"," It looks like they got hacked. "
"14027590","14028890"," I had a moment."
"14029430","14038630"," It was a moment last year, last year or the year before, where I was very upset at my trading."
"14040070","14042370"," I go through cycles too. "
"14043290","14046630"," So I keep my wins and losses by the week."
"14047390","14048210"," For day trading."
"14048870","14051110"," Like what do I look like at the end of a week?"
"14052170","14053330"," And you know what?"
"14053450","14057510"," My worst trading is when I'm tired, hung over on streaming. "
"14058050","14059210"," So it's difficult."
"14060030","14061050"," I traded yesterday."
"14061770","14069370"," I traded Tuesday and I traded Friday. "
"14071010","14073990"," And it's so much easier."
"14073990","14080790"," Like what I'm streaming here with you guys, I'm trying to pay attention to the chat, streamlabs,"
"14081070","14084450"," the charts, and it's very intensive."
"14084890","14087710"," Like as an example, right?"
"14088190","14092110"," Like I wouldn't be paying attention to this right now if I wasn't streaming. "
"14092810","14095010"," So as we came up here, it closed out and it'd be done."
"14095930","14097310"," And I wouldn't care if we went up here."
"14097410","14099710"," I wouldn't care if we went up here. "
"14099910","14101450"," I would use this mostly."
"14101950","14102870"," It's a great question, by the way."
"14103730","14107070"," It's like if we went up here and closed about here, we're like, hell yeah, this is great. "
"14107390","14109150"," This is, we're not going to roll the market over."
"14109470","14113150"," If we failed to at least touch this stuff, I'd be like, yeah, it's a double top."
"14113910","14114490"," You know what I mean?"
"14114990","14117250"," It's like this part of the day I wouldn't be trading. "
"14119410","14123250"," As a matter of fact, Winky and I were just talking about this, that we're going to change a lot"
"14123250","14123590"," of program."
"14124590","14126990"," So we're not doing this all day long."
"14127230","14129370"," A big part of the stream is action. "
"14129730","14131910"," So like someone always wants to trade."
"14132150","14134350"," Good day, bad day, middle of the afternoon."
"14135150","14136490"," I just dropped my kids off. "
"14136890","14139050"," It's three in the afternoon and I have time to trade."
"14139950","14141730"," So I do, I over trade here."
"14145260","14146540"," Would a co-host help?"
"14146800","14146920"," Yes. "
"14147660","14155980"," So we have, uh, Binky is coming on to trade or to do a stock show on Saturday Sundays and"
"14155980","14161000"," I have, I have approached other co-hosts and it's hard to find one man."
"14161100","14163420"," It's not easy to find a co-host."
"14163540","14167860"," So if you know anybody out there that would ever be interested, someone that would feel comfortable"
"14167860","14177840"," on camera or with an avatar would feel comfortable with trading and, um, trading and,"
"14177840","14180200"," uh, hosting both of those things. "
"14180920","14185360"," Even if it's not the spy, if someone wants to come on and do like camera doing NDX today or"
"14185360","14190820"," we're trading stock today, Winky and I were just talking about, um, like right now at this moment,"
"14191060","14194460"," we should talk, because we're, because we're going to try to write this format where it's like"
"14194460","14198460"," right where we are at this, at this moment, there's other shit we can be looking at."
"14199520","14203220"," And being like, hey, you want to trade this stock together on stream and we can trade that stock"
"14203220","14203580"," together."
"14209470","14217440"," Oh, thanks, SCT. "
"14224270","14230750"," Yeah, I do like the, we're talking the other day about how we're talking the other day, just to"
"14230750","14232330"," thank God I wasn't in that trade."
"14233190","14236990"," So we're talking the other day about, um, I was talking to Winky."
"14237190","14241210"," So Winky and I were tired heading into last weekend, right?"
"14241350","14245270"," We're like, just tired, like working hard, working hard, working hard, working hard. "
"14245270","14246330"," We're just tired, right?"
"14246550","14252210"," So coming into Friday, you don't realize how tired you are."
"14253230","14256430"," And, um, it's stressful, right?"
"14256790","14258330"," You're like on the screen all day long."
"14258550","14259210"," It's every day. "
"14260030","14269600"," And we're discussing over the weekend and, um, when, when you're like,"
"14269920","14273460"," so I'm here with you all day long, right?"
"14274580","14275720"," So I'm here with you all day long."
"14275720","14278780"," I try to be here most, like I'm here fucking five days a week, basically."
"14279620","14281700"," So I'm here all day long with you guys. "
"14282580","14284000"," If we're at a top, right?"
"14285820","14288860"," You'll have like bulls exiting the stream."
"14289460","14299680"," You're like, hey, and then if we start to roll over, bears"
"14299680","14300840"," start entering the stream."
"14301440","14302680"," This isn't bad either. "
"14302900","14306720"," They just, they enter the stream and they're like, you guys, I'll get pulled up in here."
"14306900","14308620"," You like, fuck all you bulls, right?"
"14309800","14311620"," Fuck you too, captain, right?"
"14312680","14315000"," And you're like, oh, no, man, we just exited all our lungs."
"14315520","14317160"," And they're like, bullshit, you're still long. "
"14317340","14321260"," And we're like, no, man, no, definitely because we're here all day long, you know?"
"14321600","14323020"," And then when we get to the bottom, right?"
"14323020","14327960"," It's like, you get me at like a four o'clock in the afternoon going, did you close your puts?"
"14328720","14331200"," And they're like, ah, shit, you know?"
"14332180","14337540"," And so to get like a rotation of people in the stream, you get traders that will trade it up"
"14337540","14342460"," and down, but you get like a rotation of bulls and traders, bears and traders, right?"
"14343520","14344740"," And that's all great."
"14345160","14348420"," But it's like, it's like, it's not just stressful."
"14348800","14353340"," It's like, it's just like, like waves and waves and waves. "
"14354180","14356620"," And see, like, like, you get tired, you're like, I need a break."
"14357440","14358780"," You just need a mental health day, you know?"
"14369340","14371960"," Yes, a grubster here is saying an early jump on after I'm done."
"14375340","14377500"," Yeah, well, you know, like, I agree with that. "
"14377540","14383460"," So like, I'm a trainer, I trade both sides, but trust me, when you're here with a group of people,"
"14383460","14386340"," it's like, um, it's not that it's a bad thing."
"14386480","14388880"," It's just, uh, it's like playing basketball."
"14389180","14390320"," You play basketball all day long. "
"14390400","14392340"," You love playing basketball, but you know, you need a break."
"14392520","14393500"," Like, I gotta get a fucking break."
"14395120","14396860"," Take me out coach for like five minutes. "
"14401080","14402180"," Ah, hey, what's up?"
"14402320","14402400"," Shake."
"14402620","14403160"," Uh, what's that?"
"14403360","14404960"," Shake a Mavi Princess King."
"14405720","14411680"," Oh, she can, she can, uh, I'm hacking this up. "
"14412760","14414040"," I have a Princess King."
"14415660","14416300"," How are you?"
"14416500","14417320"," Hope, hope you're doing well."
"14418620","14420260"," I apologize for hacking your name. "
"14420380","14423220"," I like your name, though."
"14424260","14427420"," New high on the spy trading for 2194."
"14430520","14432960"," We're going to call that the scene of the crime for 2194. "
"14433540","14434260"," Is that what they're going to say?"
"14434380","14435820"," This is the scene of the crime up here?"
"14436720","14437540"," I don't believe that."
"14443150","14445570"," Oh, dude, I should have stayed in that trade."
"14448190","14450510"," I should have stayed in that trade. "
"14451850","14453610"," Oh, no, maybe not."
"14453990","14456250"," They're only at 16 cents right now."
"14456930","14460630"," Like this liquidity break right here, they're at 16 cents or up a penny. "
"14462770","14464210"," They're up a penny right now."
"14468920","14471200"," For all that drama, dude, one penny."
"14478570","14480030"," I've been an only fan. "
"14482770","14483330"," Appreciate it."
"14486590","14488310"," Oh, you guys are awesome out there."
"14488410","14488890"," You guys are great. "
"14503720","14505460"," What about live stream during the powers?"
"14505700","14509220"," Yeah, it sounds like it's kind of weird."
"14509480","14512340"," Like, someone's always wanting to trade, always."
"14513140","14517200"," So people are like, people are like, Captain Jim James wasn't here today. "
"14517920","14521220"," And I'm like, you get like the kind of show that we do."
"14522500","14524640"," It's like people are like, got a guy called me."
"14524680","14526200"," I say, good friend of the show. "
"14526200","14529620"," He's like, he's like, even when I'm not trading, I leave you out of my office."
"14529840","14532280"," He's like, put a little microphone in my arm, a little headphone in my ear."
"14532400","14533580"," I just listen to your talk all day long. "
"14534480","14536840"," So, you're like, people are like, I want you there all day long."
"14537040","14538180"," I want to be there all day long."
"14538300","14540120"," It just, it's a lot of work. "
"14540500","14541800"," It is so much work."
"14542920","14546500"," Oh, blood in the market."
"14547780","14549800"," Now, there's 17 cents right now. "
"14549920","14550360"," I'm not in them."
"14550520","14551380"," I wish I had stayed in them."
"14552780","14556420"," 17 cents blood in the marketplace right now. "
"14558260","14562020"," There's getting crafty out there, trying to trap a bull."
"14562660","14570560"," A little bit of a squeeze in here for some liquidity of a 4.2194. So, yeah, I like it."
"14570720","14572080"," We have one more co-host to be badass. "
"14572640","14579100"," I'd really like to have somebody make a nightly video, even if I did it with them, and I'd do"
"14579100","14580060"," it with them for like a week or two."
"14581120","14591100"," I'd love to do a nightly video where we review like thingman plus tea, the ape"
"14591100","14600920"," stocks, and I guess meta now, and then the major indexes, and maybe"
"14600920","14604880"," like Bitcoin and oil, maybe HYG and stuff."
"14605740","14609140"," And I would want to do with just the trigger, so it'd be fast. "
"14609700","14616180"," Like just bang through like 20 tickers and you give the hey, if this, then that, you know, if we're"
"14616180","14617570"," above this, this is where we're going."
"14617570","14620990"," If below this, we're going there as like an update video every night."
"14621510","14622510"," I think that'd be really cool. "
"14623030","14624810"," And so we have the stock show on Sundays."
"14625150","14631330"," We have someone giving an outlook for the following day."
"14631590","14636990"," If I can't do that, I think at some point, once the tool is released, maybe we'll just do that"
"14636990","14643090"," focus at like 3 p.m. and then we'll cut that video out and we'll post it at like 9"
"14643090","14644180"," o'clock a night or something. "
"14644760","14646220"," And so we have to find a solution to that."
"14649820","14659720"," I think appreciate it there, S.E.T. I'm not only caps, only fans admin, but I'm also a client."
"14665040","14666860"," Did bullet capital, what up brother?"
"14667740","14668400"," How you doing, man?"
"14668640","14669140"," Good to see you. "
"14672760","14674560"," 30 bears entered the chat."
"14674780","14675420"," What up, bullet?"
"14676080","14677000"," What's going on?"
"14678620","14680900"," I had some puts for a minute, man."
"14681060","14682000"," I got stopped on a penny. "
"14682240","14684740"," So they're still not really up."
"14684900","14687140"," They're kind of still bouncing around with my buy-in."
"14689220","14690200"," Good to see you, bullet. "
"14691840","14692780"," How you been brother?"

"15378980","15387420"," it's been tended for when it impacts the market when it doesn't but that the market is still free"
"15387420","15388620"," to do what it wants to do."
"15389600","15398100"," So depending on the what where the market is, you can infer things from that bare seagull."
"15398400","15402160"," He'd be like, well it's interacting like this with the market right now. "
"15403260","15411800"," But if if the market does like real money buying and selling can then uh have an effect on that"

"15427280","15432500"," it's a moving target and as long as you can understand that it's a moving target and what does it"
"15432500","15438960"," mean at that moment uh you get you get it if you can't get that right you can't just pin"
"15438960","15444800"," him to say well it should do this or it's you can't really pin anybody to that because uh real"
"15444800","15451120"," money buying and selling will override uh even even just momentarily it's kind of like having a"
"15451120","15458440"," cast on and running for five five five seconds or fifteen seconds right cast is going to keep you"
"15458440","15464720"," uh hobbling down the road with a pair of crutches on but if you decide to run forward uh what"

"16060290","16070060"," okay stop texting me so so"
"16070060","16076380"," as i come up here we're just trying to regain the weekly trend right we're waiting for the daily to"
"16076380","16081540"," come up and help they tried to throw it back down the daily was like nope we ain't going nowhere"
"16081540","16086780"," we're gonna build some support in here weekly is like hell no we're going down daily is like oh"
"16086780","16093760"," yeah i got market conditions buyers still stepped in down here right we're coming into this cluster"
"16093760","16103140"," here and to the emotional weekly we've got the powerful daily coming up underneath right here"
"16103140","16111980"," so this daily right here can make for explosive moves to the upside you know we're getting a little"
"16111980","16118520"," bit long in the tooth here on tesla see that straight vertical line coming up right now and it is"
"16118520","16128180"," going to try to rip some faces off at least into that 220 again so what would my plan be"
"16128180","16137930"," here on tesla to have a look you got the hourly"
"16137930","16144390"," on your side you've got the weekly on your side you've got this bad boy right here i really want"
"16144390","16152410"," to see that daily carry tesla through and above the daily is going to get there before the weekly i"
"16152410","16161210"," want to see that daily get up there before the uh before or with the hourly but i want just"
"16161210","16166470"," the hourly trying to get through the monthly i want the daily and the hourly working on my my side"
"16166470","16176820"," here so what do what am i looking for what this bad boy right here right what"
"16176820","16188710"," this kind of nonsense right here right it's going to take some time whoa"
"16188710","16193930"," makes sense so just right here what looking at this this is going to help provide the support this"
"16193930","16199770"," is going to help provide the support probably going to take a tag up here kind of push this up"
"16199770","16209710"," here that's 214.56 right it's probably not guaranteed come back down here right find"
"16209710","16219550"," that consolidation that it needs then it rips face above now you could go up here and reject"
"16219550","16226630"," but in safety right there and safety you take the money and run why do you take the money and"
"16226630","16236370"," run here because if you're able to get above here typically you'll come back down and check to make"
"16236370","16244230"," sure that we're going to the next level okay so you're going to confirm the move is actually higher"
"16244230","16255710"," you don't want to be like a whale like you don't want to be we"
"16255710","16259910"," already know that we're getting a little long of a tooth we want the daily momentum on our sides we"
"16259910","16267890"," want the hourly momentum on our sides we want the weekly momentum on our sides so you don't want to"
"16267890","16277550"," be like woohoo i'm up here and then oh shit i'm trapped right just slam yourself up here"
"16277550","16282450"," right you want to have taken the money guaranteed money there you could leave a runner or two on"
"16282450","16287130"," but you want to wait until this starts to confirm the move higher to jump back in for the next"
"16287130","16292410"," leg of the trade so we have different legs to the trade is my point you have different legs right"
"16292410","16298130"," this is the bad stuff you don't ever want to be in this this is the volatility the traffic zone"
"16298130","16304210"," you have a momentum on your side to get where you're going and you want confirmation that we're not"
"16304210","16309450"," going to roll over here you want to get up here and roll down right and get caught right and"
"16309450","16315590"," get caught and be back down here 193 you want confirmation that we're going higher so we're coming"
"16315590","16320110"," into the point where uh we're coming right now we're coming in the in the first of this month"
"16320110","16328790"," tomorrow today to expect south side to come in to tesla the next leg of your trade is a"
"16328790","16337810"," confirmation above 221 i don't care about this here i don't care this is all too risky to do this"
"16338370","16344430"," this is risky this is risky this is really risky you might come back like cap i could have made"
"16344430","16349510"," so much more money yeah but you could have made more consistent money if you took the money and ran"
"16349510","16355490"," and if you waited for the move higher and then jump back on board here these are easier more"
"16355490","16363910"," profitable or more more high probability of profitable trades next thing you're going to be asking"
"16363910","16372470"," me well cap why do you see 350 why do you see 300 if you were to throw a wake"

"16929860","16937160"," debt ceiling and this this could be it too like if we had experienced major fallout immediately"
"16937160","16943100"," from the debt ceiling like we're not paying our bills to get a credit down rating that kind of shit"
