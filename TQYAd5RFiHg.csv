"978340","985120"," on social media you're in the news and you're hearing people say things like uh we've got all this"
"985120","990860"," vol coming or this is the time uh and this is a great example these past few months has has"
"990860","997880"," been a great example where nothing that's been said no reason that's been given uh has the market"
"997880","1004780"," come down right it has not had any significant decline in the past few months every reason that's"
"1004780","1012580"," been given to this point has not led to any significant down keep that in mind because uh when"
"1012580","1017980"," people are giving you reasons in the videos that they make when people post on social media and"
"1017980","1023680"," give you reasons for why the market chick chicka down you can also you can see right here that none"
"1023680","1029980"," of those reasons uh have been the reason or have proven for the market to go down so this is"
"1029980","1035160"," why you'll hear people out there talk about being a price action trader that no matter what kind of"
"1035160","1041560"," forecasts you're given that you must always respect price uh it's a very key point here for"
"1041560","1046619"," especially for where we are i'm sure that there are people out there on social media given re"
"1046619","1051420"," giving you reasons why the market should go down this week so what we're going to do in this show"
"1051420","1056940"," is give you levels on Sundays i'm going to be really fast with this but i want you to keep"
"1056940","1061980"," that key point for yourself no matter how bullish you are no matter how bearish you are the"
"1061980","1068640"," importance of levels and trading from level two level uh and if you had done that these past few"
"1068640","1075100"," months you would be doing quite well at this point right and that even leads into this week so when"
"1075100","1081160"," we i'm going to snap levels for you you can come back in this program and note them uh but"
"1081160","1088360"," i do want to be clear with you at any point if we are to uh do a uh a"
"1088360","1096220"," check on a level that is successful uh i would i would heed that price an example here would be"
"1097580","1106380"," if you see spx come down into this uh 4390 and it bounces twice and is successful going higher here"
"1106380","1111320"," you have to respect that right you don't actually have to enter the trade until right about here"
"1111320","1118300"," but you have to respect that is my point uh if we get become range bound in here uh you"
"1118300","1123880"," have to respect it right you can't just be like hey i think it's going down that doesn't work right"
"1124520","1130340"," uh you need to break below a level you need to reject and begin to make your way down to"
"1130340","1136140"," the collar does that make sense so you can have any kind of bias you want out there uh you"
"1136140","1142720"," i don't mind giving you a bias but the truth is that we've had we've had every reason given since"
"1142720","1149640"," october why the market should go down and none of it has proved itself yeah and we we've we've"
"1149640","1155140"," spent weeks and months creating all kinds of shit that means nothing to the price of coffee and"
"1155140","1160340"," denmark right we know the market has continued higher so i want to respect these levels uh when"
"1160340","1165740"," when you're trading this week if you're looking for down in spx right now you know that you're"
"1165740","1172640"," looking for a price target down below $43.95.56 your next level down for you is $43.20.60"
"1172640","1179800"," and then $42.60 uh i'm going to say one thing to you i'm going to highlight something for you"
"1179800","1189280"," here and that is $41.20 uh maybe possibly after uh the end of month okay so market"
"1189280","1195800"," conditions the spx is going to dictate a lot of these tickers that i show to you and i want"
"1195800","1201640"," to highlight something specific for you okay especially an spx on this and we're going to go back"
"1201640","1207220"," to if we're in some kind of a bull run uh this is going to set up every other ticker"
"1207220","1214060"," out there for you okay if we're in any kind of a bull run historically bull market bull run i"
"1214060","1223640"," don't care uh we we typically come back and retest a daily trigger at some point 1 2 3 4"
"1223640","1232780"," 5 6 7 8 9 10 right so you should see some kind of a test of this every uh"
"1232780","1239900"," every three months or so you may see a retest of the orange line okay sometimes even longer six"
"1239900","1246300"," months nine months so for you if you're a bull well first of all if you're a seller uh unless"
"1246300","1253680"," we make some some structural changes to the s&p 500 you are not looking for major blood you are"
"1253680","1260700"," tempering your expectations to the downside if you are a buyer you are going to anticipate we"

"1271620","1278940"," June 24th right we're coming into that one time of the month where we may come back and revisit"
"1278940","1284200"," this if you're a long time market participant you know that once a month you normally get a"
"1284200","1291040"," downside move uh where you can sell this market it's not always but it's typically right around"
"1291040","1295960"," that third week of the month and so there are going to be some sellers in here there are long"
"1295960","1300320"," time market participants that aren't going to tell you and fintuit but they're going to expect if"

"1303500","1308060"," crash in the in the background they're going to say well fuck it if we're in a bull run then"
"1308060","1314260"," i know that every month they can expect some kind of down move to the daily trigger spx daily"
"1314260","1322180"," trigger move four two four nine jpm collar for our end of month uh closing forty three forty three"
"1322180","1329020"," twenty uh if we get a major down move four one one three point five nine we have like small"

"1694280","1699200"," note too that even though we might roll over on velocity briefly here you're talking about a move"
"1699200","1706600"," something similar to this right kind of roll down tag this right here right that's that 73.52 and"
"1706600","1713060"," then boom we start to make our way to the upside for another run in july so target to the"

"1797080","1804140"," two three four attempts to get up there so the idea here would be uh to have a nice explosive"

"2061980","2070620"," here with gold is it can take time to consolidate i am not bearish on gold but it can take"
"2070620","2080139"," time to consolidate as long as gold stays above 1926 42 and you see gold rising right here right"
"2080139","2087679"," and it's fighting to get above its daily trigger two key points for you to remember one nine two"
"2087679","2094780"," one seventy six and then one nine six three fifty five do you see this big yellow velocity down"
"2094780","2101380"," here this is like bullish this isn't bearish this is be like gold is just ready to rock it to"
"2101380","2108000"," the upside okay uh so now i don't know if this happens the one shitty thing about gold is it"
"2108000","2113600"," can like just do this until fall or winter and then it eventually makes its way higher but i am"
"2113600","2119320"," ultimately bullish on gold you are looking to close out some targets to the upside you're looking"
"2119320","2125560"," to take out two two thousand and six point eighteen now you are looking of course to take these"
"2125560","2132900"," previous highs out to the upside here you could take some time here between now and of year seek a"

"2161920","2166220"," i'm not seeing it like i got to tell you guys this is either we either have a bull run"
"2166220","2171520"," coming a bull market coming or we either have a bull mark sorry we just get rid of that one"
"2171520","2175900"," we either have a bull mark coming or a war coming well i have to do some more research here"
"2175900","2183740"," uh thanks cat what's that uh the uh the question on copper is is there going to be a recovery"
"2183740","2189880"," and the momentum that you're showing there actually suggests there is going to be a momentum i'm"
"2189880","2195060"," going to warn you guys out there that are watching right now now i haven't done i have to go"
"2195060","2202500"," back and do a ton of research i i i know only saw this yesterday and i didn't realize we're"
"2202500","2206320"," in china doing all this talk but i'm telling you guys something out there i got a research"
"2206320","2215540"," historically there we're either there's like these two choices we either going into a bull run bull"
"2215540","2221680"," market that's sustainable for a period of time or we're being set up in the background for some"
"2221680","2231320"," kind of major conflict uh whenever i've seen copper go explosive like this it can um if we either"
"2231320","2238500"," going to get an up market or we're going into a war type uh situation so more on that later"
"2238500","2246780"," don't be panicked but maybe there is someone that knows something we don't know this is not"
"2246780","2253160"," structural fundamental business cycle uh well i'll discuss this future in the future next week with"
"2253160","2259120"," you guys but just be careful about something here okay this structure right here is to the upside"
"2259120","2267740"," any kind of downside moves i'm looking for a major dipeye down here one two three four five right"
"2267740","2273700"," you get you get a little bit of a downside move here maybe that's the 23rd of june and you"
"2273700","2281300"," start to get this momentum push higher into july like you get that push up first first second week"
"2281300","2286960"," of july the daily triggers now right here the hourlies down here so you get like maybe like a maybe"
"2286960","2294620"," like a dipeye on the 23rd 24th and a month and then you get an explosive move higher in july"
"2294620","2301240"," in here so be wary here i got to say something to you if um if you think we're heading"
"2301240","2306940"," lower we're going to start crashing this market one of the big uh numbers for you here in dr copper"
"2306940","2315340"," is probably going to be roughly three dollars and 81 cents so we're going to monitor this one uh"
"2315340","2320300"," over the coming weeks here uh and see if you like bears are going to tell you that they're looking"
"2320300","2326040"," for this here they're looking for the break below the rejection and to catch you to the downside"
"2326040","2333300"," over here uh so i'm sure that bears will be paying attention to dr copper but ostensibly from where"
"2333300","2341700"," i'm sitting here it is not uh it is not looking it's not looking excelish if this yellow over here"
"2341700","2346760"," was way up high i might say yeah i agree with you but for right now i would be i"
"2346760","2354740"," would be very cautious of copper going down tesla baby tesla so we're going to talk tesla real"
"2354740","2363780"," quick and shocker right now we get up here we do nice break above right here come up and we"
"2363780","2370240"," test 264 16 since then we've been we've been kind of just messing around in here right"
"2370240","2376900"," consolidating you know how this goes right we come up here we break below find some strength to the"
"2376900","2384340"," upside on um on tesla i do think that we're a little bit stronger than we anticipate here we may"
"2384340","2391600"," not get back down to this 220 210 uh 247 though uh is something that i'm interested in here"
"2391600","2399620"," possibly we can get down to 222 59 we're going to raise this one up right here personally for me"
"2399620","2406980"," on tesla uh the trend is still alive uh i'm going to give you some key numbers here okay trend"
"2406980","2414160"," is over below 190 a rejection of 197 16 means trend is over for tesla i'm personally looking for a"
"2414160","2424060"," dip buy uh next week around 225 230 on a capitulation dip if at any point"
"2424060","2432340"," we stay above the hourly trigger that's 258 60 and we stay above 264 16 if we can stay above"
"2432340","2436960"," there confirm the move higher this is what people are getting caught in right i'm going to show you"
"2436960","2444280"," this right now if price on monday or tuesday stays above the hourly trigger and we confirm a move"
"2444280","2453660"," higher here uh if we stay above 264 265 and you see this happen here uh price target above 300"

"2478600","2485020"," one consolidation and then that rip higher see this right here all the structure tesla tends to"
"2485020","2490880"," trade in its daily velocity and let's just look at it you see this everything's saying up but it's"
"2490880","2497360"," really high right now it's daily velo i'd really like to see its velo come down consolidate and"
"2497360","2503260"," then make this rip higher down the road so even though we're so there's two key points there for"
"2503260","2510420"," tesla if you get above and hold 265 fuck yeah we'll take it right to 300 if it doesn't uh"
"2510420","2518220"," i'm gonna expect some kind of the same nonsense right push push push one quick move down and then"
"2518220","2523340"," i'm gonna probably send some of you guys a text and it's gonna be something like this and i'm gonna"
"2523340","2529300"," be like okay we're now going up to 300 so don't get trapped in this down here this consolidation on"
"2529300","2538920"," tesla next one apple trading below it's apples trading below it's hourly trigger hopefully"
"2538920","2542280"," apple can cool off into next week if"

"2581000","2585660"," looking to buy 170 in july if we can get down there the weekly will be up there at that"
"2585660","2590160"," point if we can get some kind of rejection in here into first of the month and then maybe tag"

"3423520","3431740"," is i got to say something to you guys out there if you're an amc kind of person uh what"
"3431740","3440590"," do i say to you if you're an amc type of person you know you're breaking below trend right now"
"3440590","3449330"," it looks like it wants to reject and begin to take out some downside but your debt your daily"
"3449330","3456970"," bellow is on your side too it's a really tough one here personally i think it's a dangerous trade"
"3456970","3466810"," uh i think it's a breakdown trade in here i'm kind of bearish on it but this velocity"
"3466810","3473590"," to the upside says otherwise so i'm going to give you this if you're an amc bull if you're an"
"3473590","3480790"," amc bull i would not be trying to get on this trade see this coming back down here you're looking"
"3480790","3487470"," for some kind of bottoming first you want to see a sideways trade on it and then try to recover"
"3487470","3496210"," watch this daily come down here right some kind of consolidation again to the upside so i'm not"
"3496210","3504010"," bullish for a squeeze on amc unless you can recover four dollars and eighty eight cents uh there's"
"3504010","3507430"," no need for to get trapped in this stuff you guys are like oh yeah it's going to come back"

"3718270","3725910"," and then of course uh 77 30 ultimately pretty bullish on this ticker not to go back and take out"
