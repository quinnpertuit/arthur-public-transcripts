"70870","72210"," Let's get right into it."
"73250","74050"," It's like serious."
"74050","74750"," We've got to go. "
"85150","86630"," Step one, two."
"91860","92480"," Save."
"93620","95220"," No, no, no, no. "
"97610","98560"," Okay, that looks right."
"100140","101700"," Let's go right into it."
"103820","107800"," You didn't even get a chance to do the opening song this morning. "
"109140","110240"," Good morning."
"110720","111680"," Happy Monday."
"112320","115600"," Kind of a holiday for the U.S. stock market. "
"116480","118220"," We've got an indigenous people day."
"119840","122600"," And Columbus Day, depending upon your views on that."
"124820","128259"," We also had a surprising weekend here. "
"129039","132280"," A couple of things we've got to do here, hang tight."
"132280","132340"," Okay."
"134760","138860"," We have a few conventional gas features rising as much as 16%. "
"139640","141280"," Turn that down a little bit there."
"143880","147440"," I'm sure, well, I'm not sure, but I'm wondering."
"149460","153760"," Were all of you glued to your Internet this weekend?"
"154320","157000"," Or did you get to go outside and about?"
"157000","159320"," This dream is sponsored by to the team. "
"159780","163260"," Free daily points for the energy and market profile levels."
"165000","166780"," Their volume is out of control."
"169820","171240"," Share that really quick. "
"175320","176360"," The so."
"178120","179920"," So I'll get back here really quick."
"180160","180560"," Good morning. "
"180580","181440"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"181520","182360"," Hope y'all had a great weekend."
"182360","189940"," I was supposed to do a show on Saturday morning and could not do that show."
"190540","191720"," We'll talk about that at some point. "
"191900","193840"," We're going to probably do that show today."
"194840","197640"," So let's bring this over so you can see it."
"199400","201100"," Bring that there for you. "
"201200","201900"," That's a one minute chart."
"202980","204960"," And then we'll take a look at what's going on here."
"205100","211600"," We've got price trying to break above the weekly trigger and trade the daily trigger. "
"211600","217980"," I'm sure some of you thought we'd wake up this morning with a stock market crash."
"219360","221400"," We'll get into that this morning as well."
"222940","226660"," We got a lot to go over, I guess, right?"
"227140","227580"," That would be my. "
"228160","229020"," Are we buying calls?"
"230120","232060"," You should have bought calls in the open."
"232060","232860"," I can tell you that."
"238080","240000"," You should have bought calls in the open. "
"240200","240760"," Let's start with."
"241040","242440"," Let's start at the top though."
"243040","245000"," It's important to see where we are in the marketplace. "
"245560","247360"," So number one, okay."
"249520","250480"," Last week."
"252000","253220"," We were in. "
"254740","257760"," And oversold conditions coming into last week."
"258000","261120"," We had a liquidation event in the marketplace last week."
"262320","268340"," We looked at the oversold conditions on the market breadth, right?"
"270080","272280"," And regardless of your views. "
"273480","277160"," On where the market goes, whether we're going up or down."
"277260","280080"," A new bond yield extended for a last down 10 spot."
"280300","282980"," Six basis points at around three spots, seven, eight, five percent. "
"283340","284500"," I'm going to turn this down already."
"284680","285520"," I'm going to turn down some more."
"286900","291180"," So regardless of the overall trend of the market, okay. "
"292560","296100"," We become oversold, whether we're going up, going down."
"296700","298140"," Right now the trend is up still."
"298840","300000"," Technically, it's still up. "
"301480","306100"," But it doesn't matter if we were technically still up or technically on our way down."
"306820","310300"," Whenever we're in oversold conditions, we do get a bounce."
"311020","313560"," We get that bounce even in the crash in 2020. "
"313780","314180"," It doesn't matter."
"314180","316500"," It'd be like bloodbath."
"317140","318160"," Maybe 87. "
"318860","321860"," It'd be the last time that we did not have something like that happen."
"323100","325080"," And there was no market to be made."
"325280","326380"," They had to actually make a market. "
"326880","336060"," But generally speaking, unless you have some kind of a technical reason for the market not to"
"336060","337120"," bounce, it will bounce."
"338840","342540"," You have too many examples of that happening historically."
"342540","349960"," So coming into last week, you saw that technical bounce, right?"
"350760","352820"," And we're in oversold conditions. "
"353060","355020"," We had a liquidation moment in the indexes."
"356840","363900"," And so there should be some base idea or expectation that the market should bounce."
"364660","368160"," Simple way to even look at that or to express that would be. "
"370060","376960"," Here is, if you look at the chart down below here, we can put this in a 15 minute, maybe"
"376960","377300"," basis."
"379500","382400"," You can see that playing out right now, right?"
"382580","385640"," This is some bottoming action down here."
"387460","390740"," And you're watching this market being bought, right?"
"390740","392300"," The expectation is that we're going higher. "
"393540","396680"," None of this should end as a base case."
"396680","398460"," Okay, this was leading in the last week."
"399680","406280"," Now, even if you think we reverse the downside or whatever, there is a technical bounce taking"
"406280","406620"," place. "
"408180","417100"," Now, I do find what happened this weekend fascinating because if we were topping,"
"419100","427160"," if we were in overbought conditions, you'd probably see the market a good time next to the market,"
"427160","427460"," right?"
"428700","433700"," You've got a risky event out there and you take your money off the table."
"434020","442400"," You enjoy your profits, you walk away, and you wait for the volatility to subside, right?"
"442520","443820"," It's kind of like matches up nicely."
"448800","453680"," Now, we weren't overbought when this happened this weekend, were we?"
"454140","458920"," This is a good point here for you to think about. "
"459220","461000"," So the market was not overbought."
"461690","471600"," And I'm going to put a thesis out there that the banks love"
"471600","473800"," to know what's going on before anyone else."
"474530","484540"," And when the banks don't know what's going on before everyone else, or we're not overbought, our"
"484540","492180"," stock market will not follow whatever that initial reaction is"
"492180","496740"," where it should go, right?"
"496740","506020"," So our banks are not going to bankrupt themselves because of what happened this weekend. "
"506540","511360"," I know that some of you have that death wish for the market, but that's not what's going to happen."
"511840","521200"," And so usually when there's unknown news to the markets that can move markets, especially if"
"521200","526360"," they're not positioned for that move, the bank specifically, that move will be erased."
"527280","533480"," That initial move, that initial market reaction will be erased, and then the banks will position"
"533480","538600"," themselves how they feel as though the impact of those news events will happen. "
"539580","543800"," So you see this play out oftentimes in the market."
"544040","548920"," Now, if the banks are positioned for it, they're fine, but if it's truly unknown to them, whatever"
"548920","552880"," initial market reaction you see, this can be on individual tickers as well."
"552880","554660"," It normally comes back. "
"556200","566060"," The second thing you should be aware of is that Sunday's pullback into Monday today"
"566060","568000"," is not unexpected."
"568900","571580"," You're not going up near 100 points on Friday."
"573320","578760"," Coming back on Monday, seeing a pullback would not be out of the realm of possibility, right?"
"579080","581060"," And that's what we got today was a pullback. "
"582140","583860"," We did not get a bloodbath."
"584040","586920"," We did not get a crash or any of that kind of stuff."
"587820","594280"," And as a matter of fact, we've taken all that back again, right back where we were, basically right"
"594280","595580"," back where we were. "
"597020","599260"," Two Fridays price, right?"
"600880","606080"," Back up here again in the market that can decide where it wants to go from here."
"606940","612940"," So if you want an exit and orderly exit, you're being given that opportunity today."
"616980","622100"," They weren't already going to sell this market or would have happened into today. "
"623120","630860"," Another thing about today is, or we'll get to the Israeli Hamas thing at some point this morning"
"630860","632000"," and its impact on markets."
"632960","634900"," But let's look at just that stuff there."
"635500","636640"," Market was bottoming. "
"637380","638000"," They were oversold."
"639160","640020"," We got a technical bounce."
"641180","643080"," And we did not sell off over the weekend. "
"644180","648640"," And that's more than likely due to the fact that banks didn't see this coming."
"649120","655040"," And with their pants down around their legs, they're not going to crash this market and get caught"
"655040","657060"," the wrong way."
"658020","662040"," Counter to your probably your own beliefs thinking that that's going to happen to them. "
"662140","666580"," It might happen someday, but it's going to be a rare occurrence for that to happen."
"667780","674100"," Now saying that they've been given if you're a market participant, you're a large market"
"674100","680560"," participant, you've been given an opportunity today to find out how you want to be positioned,"
"680940","681040"," right?"
"681760","686660"," Whether that's up or down or whether there is vault so they can come into the picture, expansion of"
"686660","688920"," war with that kind of stuff."
"690140","691840"," Their banks are being given an opportunity. "
"692120","695380"," Whether you like that or not, that's what's happening today, this morning, right now, right?"
"697460","700520"," There was no crash over the weekend and they weren't prepared for a crash."
"700520","703820"," If they were prepared to sell the market, it would have dumped."
"704260","708120"," If they were already exiting the market, it would have dumped, but they weren't. "
"708380","709860"," So you're not going to see that."
"711480","712080"," You're not."
"712280","713280"," It's just not going to happen. "
"713720","718520"," I'm sure some of you were going down that rabbit hole over the weekend thinking, you know, doom and"
"718520","719500"," gloom for Monday morning."
"720440","723360"," And you're just not going to see it unless they're positioned that way."
"724380","728900"," If they're positioned to start selling like an oversold, an overbought bounce or something like"
"728900","733760"," that, we'd be waking up this morning with a bloodbath and you'd be saying, Oh, look, the market's"
"733760","738120"," crashing because of what's happening in Gaza and Israel. "
"740440","742980"," So it's always fascinating when you see stuff like this."
"743020","749700"," You can tell that the markets were caught off guard by what took place this weekend."
"750520","752760"," Had they been positioned for it, we would have been down. "
"753780","757020"," And so now they're being given the position to reposition for that."
"757020","766840"," So from that basis, can we get volatility from the events in Israel and Gaza?"
"768800","769320"," Yes."
"770020","771960"," Should you be positioned for it?"
"772100","772300"," Yes. "
"772600","775460"," I am positioned for this, if you want to know."
"776320","780280"," I have Wednesday crash puts on that cost me nothing."
"781020","783560"," Cost me, I think three cents or something, four cents. "
"785440","788420"," And so I've got a hedge on the market right now."
"788500","794500"," If you don't have a hedge on the market, you should have one because you don't know what's going to"
"794500","794720"," happen."
"795380","797960"," This is where we're going to get into the mechanics of all this. "
"798740","800360"," So today is Monday, right?"
"801300","811280"," The stock market is really closed today, whether you believe that or"
"811280","813540"," not."
"813540","814700"," The institutions are not open today."
"815840","819060"," Banks are closed, a lot of government offices are closed, bond markets closed. "
"820800","825460"," So can we get, can we make big moves today due to that?"
"825680","825840"," Sure."
"828320","832020"," But in all reality, this would be what I would consider a positioning day."
"832340","843260"," So you've been given a reprieve as a participant in the US stock market to at least hedge"
"843260","843600"," yourself. "
"844340","844940"," You're lucky."
"845160","846980"," The banks weren't hedged for that move."
"847640","849340"," And you can see that we didn't move down due to that. "
"849540","851300"," So that's my view."
"851460","855740"," But I've got this old man view that a lot of our market is fake as fuck."
"857040","860060"," So I know that you don't believe that, but I believe that. "
"860480","866240"," I don't think that if I own this market, if I was the guy that owned this market or for"
"866240","872340"," my friends or for my friends, we're not going to, I'm not going to go bankrupt because you some guy"
"872340","873840"," on Fintuit thinks we should."
"874880","878720"," Because of war in Israel or anywhere else for that matter."
"880140","881200"," Anywhere else that matters. "
"881460","886180"," So it can happen, but most of the time we're due for it."
"886540","889260"," Even COVID, we were kind of due for a crash, right?"
"889420","890400"," We're leading up to that."
"891260","892700"," Moments if any of you remember that. "
"892700","894680"," So was it surprising?"
"895220","895340"," No."
"895620","896340"," Were we way over?"
"896520","896620"," Fuck."
"896620","897560"," Yeah, we were. "
"899960","904880"," So right where you are right now at this moment seems like people are being given an opportunity to"
"904880","906440"," hedge to the downside."
"907540","913440"," If you own this market, if you own this market, I'll say this to you."
"915240","923480"," You've got real volatility that's possible here in the market. "
"923620","924720"," I have to warn you of that."
"926780","932980"," We'll get into Israel and Gaza at some point and Hamas and Iran and all this other shit and"
"932980","934920"," whatever you guys want to get into."
"935100","941220"," We can discuss it as long as we're not trashing anybody or disparaging. "
"941340","942700"," We're not going to disparage anybody in this."
"943240","946280"," We're going to deal with the impacts on the stock market."
"947820","949380"," So we're going to clarify that too. "
"951860","954000"," So you're, you're, we're given an opportunity as my point."
"954220","954440"," Okay."
"955060","957860"," Two heads today on Monday. "
"958420","960740"," The market is going to be slow today."
"961080","964400"," I wouldn't expect a ton of big moves today."
"964900","968360"," Maybe some squeeze in, maybe some hedging effects in the market. "
"969340","975320"," But everybody be back tomorrow for the first day or for the real first day of the market is"
"975320","976340"," tomorrow, my viewpoint."
"978480","981220"," Now, you can hedge appropriately."
"981760","984920"," You should, if you own this market, if you're like me, you own the market, you own parts of this"
"984920","985140"," market. "
"985380","989980"," You should hedge against volatility because you don't know what's going to happen."
"991280","994220"," And I'll tell you what, when it comes to religion, this is true."
"994440","994540"," Okay. "
"994600","1002660"," When it comes to religion, you cannot trust people that are religious"
"1002660","1004780"," fanatics."
"1004780","1006560"," I guess you could say that."
"1006940","1010740"," Well, no, it's, it's larger than that, but just be aware that you cannot. "
"1010960","1015020"," You saw two Israelis get shot in Egypt over the weekend."
"1016560","1018840"," I'm going to, I was in the military for 12 years."
"1018980","1023960"," I was in US Army command for a period of that. "
"1024520","1029940"," And I can assure you that the 100% that the United States is on a high level of readiness"
"1029940","1031980"," or ramping to that."
"1031980","1040160"," I would assume that any kind of United States infrastructure that that is at risk is potential"
"1040160","1040520"," there."
"1040720","1050440"," So like if you're traveling as United States citizen, if you're going to any high visible like soft"
"1050440","1052860"," targets, I wouldn't be there personally. "
"1053700","1054880"," Because you don't know what's going to happen."
"1054880","1056080"," You don't know if there's going to be a terrorist attack."
"1056200","1059880"," You don't know if someone will do something that they shouldn't do. "
"1061000","1064820"," A one off event from a small group or one person, something like that."
"1064920","1071220"," So I'm going to warn you that there is actual risk from what's going on right now in the Middle"
"1071220","1071420"," East."
"1072380","1073780"," That could come out of left field. "
"1074020","1075360"," Things that you don't expect to happen."
"1076060","1077620"," Things that you say, oh, we're safe here."
"1078280","1078900"," You're not. "
"1079200","1080660"," You really aren't."
"1082940","1086940"," So there's risk and there's volatility they'll be associated with that if anything does happen."
"1086940","1092660"," And there's likely a hair trigger being placed on our markets right now today for that kind of an"
"1092660","1093400"," event to happen. "
"1093900","1095700"," So you know, you've been given warning."
"1095700","1097100"," You were given warning over the weekend."
"1097280","1098060"," Today's Monday. "
"1098480","1104960"," The market did not crash day given warning to protect yourself against any possibility of anything"
"1104960","1111020"," really, really nasty happening or escalation happening out there."
"1111160","1112260"," And that stuff does happen."
"1112260","1114600"," I want you to know that that. "
"1116000","1120820"," When I was in the Army, the people say like paper tiger, all this other stuff or where this or"
"1120820","1121080"," where that."
"1121780","1129340"," I assure you, once once once that stuff is on the table publicly for you and I to consume."
"1131820","1136880"," We stop fucking around like the our military stuff's fucking around other military stuff fucking"
"1136880","1138520"," around and people and. "
"1139300","1141600"," Dude, like it's hard to say that stuff."
"1143380","1153300"," Do not at any point ever discount the will of Israel or the United States in these type of"
"1153300","1153760"," situations."
"1155460","1156440"," I'll leave it there. "
"1156780","1160420"," So that's good or bad or whatever it is."
"1162220","1167860"," You as a market participant need to know that the things that you need to know is that you should"
"1167860","1174340"," be hedged or wary or aware that things can go sideways down the wrong way."
"1174720","1179120"," I don't know what to say would not to say on this stuff, but be aware of it and its"
"1179120","1182040"," impacts that it can have on our on our stock market. "
"1182360","1184580"," Don't be like, yeah, I didn't see that coming right."
"1185400","1186600"," So the bad was to happen."
"1188480","1194040"," Yeah, they're pretty much, you know, so when I was in the army, right?"
"1194120","1197660"," We had an acronym was called oil and the O stood for. "
"1198080","1202780"," I don't know why I should be saying like the O stood for oil and OPEC and then the I"
"1202780","1205100"," stood for Israel and L stood for logistics."
"1206440","1213960"," You've got a complete change in US military posturing."
"1214700","1216140"," We're moving away from coin. "
"1216480","1221440"," We're going to division structure in our in our military."
"1221800","1227200"," This is like a thing from like World War two and shit where you're fighting large scale Cold War"
"1227200","1229640"," stuff like large scale or ground wars."
"1231400","1234360"," We're positioning for that to confront China. "
"1235000","1236900"," Whether you know that or not, I don't know."
"1237800","1239700"," I can assure you that's happening right now."
"1239700","1244420"," There's a paradigm shift in the US military to confront China. "
"1244980","1251120"," Whether you want to hear that like that dislike that your your anti war doesn't really matter."
"1251580","1257100"," It's what's what the reality is versus what we hope or wish things would be is completely"
"1257100","1257540"," different."
"1257760","1262000"," And when we switch to that and our military switches to that. "
"1263760","1264280"," Posturing."
"1265280","1267260"," This is a great open door for us."
"1267260","1270340"," It's not something you want to hear, but it is. "
"1270720","1277640"," It's a great open door for that transition for more boots in the ground in the Middle East."
"1278560","1284000"," And that is in line with confronting China believe it or not."
"1286900","1289240"," So we got to talk about a bunch of stuff like we got. "
"1290140","1292880"," We're going to head back towards that whole conversation with China too."
"1292880","1296360"," Then there's an argument to made that World War three has already begun."
"1298060","1299240"," That it's it began. "
"1300020","1305700"," If you look past World War two and the Korean War Vietnam War and ever war since then."
"1305880","1310560"," If you talk to futurists and people that discuss the future of the United States, hegemony and all"
"1310560","1311060"," that kind of stuff."
"1311840","1313840"," You know that or at least in my belief. "
"1314840","1321860"," At least this goes back to economists, scientists, social scientists, government scientists."
"1322640","1329180"," They know even in our even in capitalistic debt cycles, even non-capitalistic debt cycles."
"1329980","1333680"," That war plays a part in those debt cycles. "
"1335080","1338680"," Civil unrest plays a war in those debt cycles."
"1339450","1346180"," And if you can minimize them through proxy war, if you can minimize the impact to your people"
"1346180","1347580"," through proxy war."
"1348240","1353920"," If you can minimize the impact of a civil war through social unrest. "
"1356280","1359040"," Instead of having civil war, you have social unrest, right?"
"1359180","1361600"," Instead of having a World War, you have a proxy war."
"1362300","1367420"," So we try to manage those conflicts in today's day and age."
"1367420","1373820"," I don't know that they'll be successful at that, but they have tried that since World War two. "
"1375020","1376940"," And we've become smarter."
"1381100","1385200"," So it's not surprising to see this this weekend is my point."
"1385260","1392480"," It's not surprising to see the Arab League wanting an audience with Russia. "
"1392480","1398300"," It's not surprising to see notions of Iran being involved."
"1398500","1405400"," Hezbollah being tried to be dragged into this confrontation and an escalation around the world."
"1405840","1413360"," Or even just proxy wars around the world try to stem the impact of COVID money that floated around"
"1413360","1413600"," the world. "
"1413800","1415460"," Everybody was giving money out during COVID."
"1415900","1422840"," The whole world was there was a pause in the world for COVID and his money sloshing around."
"1423540","1424960"," This wasn't given to you and me. "
"1425100","1428900"," This was given to corporations, rich people, all that kind of stuff."
"1429600","1435980"," And, you know, when we're in this weird site, this part of this weird part of the cycle, it's not"
"1435980","1436380"," surprising."
"1437080","1442460"," None of you out there should be surprised by this to some extent. "
"1445680","1451300"," And, you know, China, Russia, United States, what do they really need to do?"
"1451480","1452940"," They need to avoid a World War three."
"1453600","1460480"," But outside of that, if you can create proxy wars around the world, it benefits the end of a debt"
"1460480","1460960"," cycle."
"1461200","1464700"," It benefits all that COVID money. "
"1464940","1466060"," That's terrible to say all that."
"1466600","1468560"," I don't want to say it and I don't want to believe it."
"1468560","1470700"," My main street hat doesn't believe that. "
"1471180","1476760"," But my trainer hat, my stock market hat, my greed hat, all that, all those hats."
"1477800","1483860"," Power hat, like all the hats that, all the powerful, greedy people, smart people in the world kind"
"1483860","1488760"," of know that this is hand in hand with where we are in our debt cycle."
"1493840","1496840"," Hey, Dylan, thanks for becoming a member. "
"1497020","1497680"," I appreciate that."
"1500780","1502440"," Let me see what you guys are saying real quick."
"1502460","1504440"," I'm missing some of the missing some of the. "
"1504680","1506620"," Oh, no, I'm getting some of the chat right now."
"1506700","1507100"," So."
"1509640","1511940"," A hedge is where the way to go. "
"1512020","1516420"," Someone asked what kind of hedge fucking put back spread hands down."
"1516740","1518040"," We should go up here."
"1518480","1519580"," The thesis for you. "
"1519740","1523760"," I want you to know if you're out there and you're watching the show right now, the thesis should be"
"1523760","1525340"," that we're going up."
"1526340","1529060"," But with that thesis, you have a fly in the ointment."
"1529300","1530920"," Don't do you've got what took place. "
"1532360","1537220"," You got what took place this past weekend and you've got the daily trigger coming down on top of"
"1537220","1537820"," the weekly trigger."
"1538360","1541180"," And that it doesn't spell positivity, right?"
"1542060","1543740"," We haven't read the needle yet to the upside."
"1545540","1546520"," Put back edge. "
"1547540","1548740"," Like put back spreads."
"1550560","1551540"," Ratio spread."
"1552060","1554660"," And if the market goes up, you're going to be fine. "
"1555440","1556700"," You're going to be flat."
"1557520","1559180"," I wouldn't do with all your money either."
"1559640","1563280"," And this is not financial advice, but if you structure it right, you watch. "
"1564040","1565100"," Videos and read books."
"1565120","1570000"," And if you don't understand what I'm talking about down YouTube, go to the options industry"
"1570000","1570300"," console."
"1570520","1573820"," It's a free free video series. "
"1574100","1574480"," You can find."
"1575300","1577440"," The options industry console on YouTube."
"1577540","1579040"," They have a web page as well. "
"1579200","1586920"," They're nonprofit and they discuss quite clearly how to structure ratio spreads, negative ratio"
"1586920","1587400"," spreads."
"1588000","1588840"," The market goes up."
"1589160","1591340"," You'll be flat or make a little bit of money. "
"1591340","1594640"," If the market blasts to the downside, you're going to make bank."
"1595540","1596860"," But you're given an opportunity today."
"1596920","1597200"," It's Monday. "
"1597580","1598480"," You're given a chance."
"1598480","1599740"," The market came back, went up."
"1600260","1606020"," You're being given a chance to hedge yourself against any potential volatility that will arise in"
"1606020","1607020"," the coming days or weeks. "
"1607440","1608440"," And it's going to."
"1608720","1612840"," Or you're going to see Israel's been given a little bit of carte blanche here."
"1613020","1617040"," But with that carte blanche usually will come. "
"1619040","1620640"," Events that are that are going to be."
"1621140","1622360"," They're not going to be pretty."
"1622920","1623940"," It's not going to be pretty. "
"1624180","1626900"," I would not expect pretty out of what happened this weekend."
"1626900","1628980"," In any way, shape or form."
"1629180","1635480"," So expect the markets to be pushed around today, specifically because there aren't a lot of players"
"1635480","1636000"," in the market. "
"1636140","1638640"," Expect hedging flows to come into the market."
"1641140","1645440"," Due to this event, it would behoove you to put those hedging flows on."
"1646280","1648520"," You can see the roll coming in right now. "
"1648840","1652040"," A little bit of quiddity to the upside from the weekly trigger up here."
"1652640","1655300"," Coming back down into this hourly once more."
"1657760","1659620"," And you know, you got your chance. "
"1660600","1661500"," You really do."
"1661620","1662040"," You got your chance."
"1668990","1674510"," Gdad Gold, change your trading view, please, to extended hours trading. "
"1676290","1679510"," I think we said that on the show, so please attempt to do that."
"1681960","1682620"," You got it."
"1682680","1683080"," Thanks, Jill. "
"1683260","1683820"," Appreciate that."
"1685840","1688080"," So a big thing for you this morning."
"1688080","1690640"," I'm having some streaming issues today. "
"1690760","1692220"," I had streaming issues this weekend, too."
"1693760","1695260"," I'm having streaming issues this morning, too."
"1695820","1697680"," I've had some internet issues over the weekend. "
"1698400","1699960"," I'm still having them right now."
"1700360","1703460"," So just be aware."
"1705800","1709080"," Just be aware that you're going to see hedging. "
"1709580","1712620"," You're going to see like Bob on Main Street that owns."
"1713380","1715540"," You know, a 401k."
"1718820","1719560"," He's going to be calling. "
"1720080","1723300"," He called his financial advisor and saying you're hedging for this."
"1724020","1724840"," It's that simple."
"1725440","1728600"," You probably got phones ringing across the United States making sure that people are hedged. "
"1728720","1731380"," You're going to see those hedging flows impact our market."
"1731860","1735820"," Not necessarily sent it to the depths of hell, but the hedge will go on today."
"1736440","1738820"," So be aware of that, that there will be a hedge in the market today. "
"1738820","1739120"," That's right."
"1743160","1744480"," Let's check this."
"1744760","1746320"," Let's go to this one minute trigger here. "
"1746820","1754880"," Let's look at coming in to test the hourly trigger right now."
"1755560","1759080"," We went up and looked for some liquidity up at the weekly trigger."
"1759460","1761560"," We're coming back down to the hourly trigger right now. "
"1762980","1766200"," My personal belief is that we're going to bounce around in here."
"1766200","1768640"," But even if we don't, we start to roll this market lower."
"1768940","1771200"," We'll know if you're trading that. "
"1771380","1776440"," If you're trading a crash or some kind or something like that, hold on here."
"1776960","1786700"," You are looking for a bounce here and a rejection to get underneath something like that."
"1787120","1793700"," You'll be looking for you know not to get caught inside of, you know not to get caught inside of"
"1793700","1795020"," the finger trap. "
"1795200","1798080"," We know where that is right here and right here."
"1798740","1801420"," This is a zone of consolidation or distribution."
"1802100","1807080"," You want to pick up the downside trade again once you break below the hourly trigger, but don't get"
"1807080","1807680"," caught in here. "
"1808120","1810820"," If this reverses back to the upside, we start squeezing up."
"1811240","1812600"," You're going to be in some pain, right?"
"1812840","1815920"," This is not the zone for you to fuck around in here."
"1816180","1817740"," So I'm not the place. "
"1818240","1820520"," We'll keep this open right here."
"1822580","1826100"," We'll see if the sellers get that rejection trade to the downside."
"1829960","1838380"," And we'll talk a little bit about, you guys want me to talk about any of the, or if you"
"1838380","1842820"," want my take on what's going on the Middle East. "
"1843800","1848900"," I'm not going to give a lot of take on it or my own opinions."
"1848900","1849800"," I'm going to leave."
"1850000","1854080"," I'm going to make sure this broadcast stays focused on its impact. "
"1856840","1857940"," What's going on the Middle East?"
"1858160","1863600"," It's impact is on the US stock market, the dollar gold oil, all that kind of stuff."
"1865060","1866880"," I don't have much of a take on it."
"1867980","1869340"," It's very muddy. "
"1869700","1872220"," You know, it's one of those things where you don't want to step."
"1872440","1877120"," It's like a ship pile that you don't want to step into unless you're like forced into it."
"1878960","1882980"," And so I'm going to refrain from that in this broadcast. "
"1886620","1896210"," Do I use non adjusted dip splits"
"1896210","1896770"," charts?"
"1897550","1900690"," The only time I really care about that stuff is when it comes to Greeks."
"1901770","1905890"," It can fuck with the Greeks, but other than that, I'm calculating Greeks."
"1905890","1909950"," I'll try to incorporate X div, all that kind of stuff. "
"1913970","1921430"," Yeah, as it pertains to the market, I'm more than happy to talk about my opinions."
"1921450","1929770"," As far as Palestinians, Jewish people are Arabs, Muslims, that kind of stuff."
"1930570","1932070"," I'm not going to comment on that stuff. "
"1932270","1934330"," I have friends that are Muslim, Arabic friends."
"1934330","1935970"," I've got Jewish friends."
"1938150","1940890"," So I don't want to get involved in that. "
"1941050","1942910"," It's a losing conversation, I think."
"1943050","1945890"," I think you just lose those conversations."
"1946770","1953150"," But how it impacts our market is volatility impacts our market for unknowns. "
"1954130","1956830"," And what can happen that does impact our market."
"1959090","1961990"," So that unknown aspect of moment discuss."
"1964450","1974230"," But the loss of life, the things that you see, you know, you can't explain most of it. "
"1974610","1975610"," Or I can't at least."
"1975870","1977130"," I can't come from that perspective."
"1977530","1986630"," Other than being an American that was there as a soldier, you probably don't want my opinions on"
"1986630","1988370"," that stuff. "
"1993890","1995010"," Yeah, it's a no in discussion."
"1995410","1996650"," It's not one that you're going to win."
"1996750","1997450"," I'm not going to win it. "
"1997570","1999370"," You guys aren't going to win when it piss people off."
"1999690","2000450"," It doesn't matter what I say."
"2000890","2002650"," It doesn't matter what I fucking say. "
"2002810","2005870"," You're going to piss a third of everybody off, right?"
"2006370","2010390"," You're going to piss off people."
"2011290","2012230"," So what do you do?"
"2013730","2014410"," What do you say?"
"2014610","2014930"," What do you do?"
"2019150","2025570"," Yeah, that's one of the biggest things here is does it drag the US in?"
"2025810","2028070"," That's going to be a big part of this."
"2028430","2031750"," Does the US get dragged in to this war?"
"2031990","2033930"," That's going to be a major aspect to this. "
"2034710","2037210"," Of course, you're going to see military stocks probably do well."
"2037370","2038630"," You're going to see oil do well."
"2038770","2043510"," You'll see the dollar could go down, believe it or not. "
"2044750","2048170"," And then oil go up, gold go up, that kind of stuff."
"2057929","2060290"," Yeah, do I think oil can go up?"
"2060510","2061469"," Not yet."
"2062250","2067449"," There's some ports outside of Israel and Gaza. "
"2067850","2068489"," There are some concerns."
"2069570","2075370"," If there's an expansion of war that involves Iran, you're going to see oil go to the moon."
"2076270","2079830"," There's one major port right now that's blocked off or blockaded. "
"2080659","2084350"," And you always see outsized moves."
"2085750","2093050"," Initially, you'll see outsized moves on gas and oil are famous for lagging."
"2094070","2098350"," Or for outsized moves for something that hasn't really happened yet. "
"2098990","2105130"," So you shouldn't see a 4% increase at the gas pump because of one port being down."
"2105410","2106670"," But that is how it happens."
"2106670","2112130"," You always see outsized moves and you don't see those moves retract for a period of time. "
"2112750","2117790"," So whatever outsized move that you see usually doesn't come back immediately."
"2118470","2122430"," It takes time for those outsized moves to pull back."
"2123050","2131610"," So I would expect an increased pressure on oil and gas prices and anticipation of an expansion of"
"2131610","2131830"," war. "
"2131830","2137330"," This morning, Israel called up, I believe, 300,000 reservists."
"2137470","2143670"," It can be wrong on that or 300,000 IRR soldiers of some kind of fashion."
"2144310","2152970"," When you see call-ups like that, especially for Israel, I want you to know that that usually is not"
"2152970","2158050"," for the expectation of a de-escalation of action. "
"2160350","2163190"," When you do a full call-up like that, you're going to war."
"2163670","2169690"," You set the wheels in motion and some bad shits about to come."
"2170510","2175230"," Whether that, you've got a deal going through between Saudi Arabia and Israel. "
"2177570","2183830"," And there's a lot of talk out there that Israel intelligence was let down."
"2183830","2188250"," That biggest failure and Israeli intelligence ever."
"2188710","2195130"," There's some aspect to this where, there's some aspect to this where seeing a bounce right now. "
"2197110","2205790"," There's some aspect to this where, I don't want to say this stuff, some of some aspect to this"
"2205790","2213830"," where, when I was, you see I have like LPs and OPs and how they set up the defense or"
"2213830","2214970"," how, I shouldn't say defenses."
"2216130","2224570"," They had like fencing and stuff or long Gaza and rather than build like North Korea and South"
"2224570","2224830"," Korea."
"2225230","2226470"," I don't know if you've been there too. "
"2227110","2232590"," So North Korea, South Korea, if you've never been there, it's a real border."
"2232590","2238430"," They have destroyed all the foliage."
"2239330","2240630"," It's so built up. "
"2240750","2241250"," It's insane."
"2241530","2242430"," There's tunnels everywhere."
"2242910","2244970"," There's but risks are high and downwards. "
"2245810","2251450"," There's troops that sit on that on that border all day long, 24 hours a day."
"2251970","2257170"," In quad, 50 of Calvin machine guns in Patriot missile batteries and."
"2260730","2261770"," It's like there at war. "
"2262250","2264190"," I don't know if you've been there, but it's like that."
"2264310","2267070"," The Berlin wall was very similar to some extent."
"2268650","2270030"," That's not the case in Gaza. "
"2270410","2274690"," You had he got fencing with with barbed wire and shit."
"2275050","2281490"," And then what they did was they have roads that funnel people moving back and forth in and out of"
"2281490","2281670"," Gaza."
"2281670","2285870"," These roads have operating posts on them. "
"2285970","2291210"," They might have like a platoon or two manned with a platoon or two of soldiers."
"2291730","2293890"," They cycle in and out of being ready, right?"
"2294930","2296510"," And you've got checkpoints."
"2297310","2298290"," What does that probably have?"
"2299110","2307510"," A squad or two and they rotate out maybe three squads from some kind of a hobbit base"
"2307510","2311810"," in the system. "
"2313550","2317910"," It's not that hard to to have an incursion like they did."
"2320110","2322290"," It's not that hard to send waves of people."
"2323370","2325790"," And overwhelm forces like that. "
"2325930","2328750"," Those those operating posts, those checkpoints are kind of set up."
"2329930","2335430"," Or if that happens that you can then call in reinforcements and stem."
"2337410","2339210"," Stem those incursions, right?"
"2339530","2339950"," So you leave. "
"2340190","2340830"," Let's say you leave."
"2341430","2343110"," This is I don't know how to explain this."
"2343370","2346130"," Let's say you leave a thousand a thousand man garrison, right?"
"2346610","2352630"," And you then you set up operating posts, checkpoints along major routes. "
"2353470","2354230"," Listening posts."
"2356270","2360330"," In the hills or in the woods or wherever it is, the desert doesn't matter."
"2361970","2366730"," And it's an easier way for you to then send reaction forces fast. "
"2367150","2370130"," You guys know what you guys might know if fast teams are, but."
"2370890","2372610"," These are like fast reaction teams."
"2372670","2377410"," You can send them from that thousand man outpost to wherever you have. "
"2379810","2381470"," I don't know what to say."
"2384550","2389470"," You send a fast reaction team out to wherever they're breaking through, right?"
"2389470","2392610"," It seems it's kind of that's that poll coin shit."
"2392830","2400750"," So in Israel kind of like took that kind of defensive posture rather than the North Korea or East"
"2400750","2406990"," Germany, West Germany style of a wall, right?"
"2407310","2411030"," Or or a DMZ of some some kind. "
"2411470","2412790"," A no man's land, right?"
"2413430","2417630"," Mind wide open."
"2417630","2419210"," All that kind of stuff."
"2419510","2427290"," So it's not surprising to me that that took place in the fashion that it took place. "
"2427570","2433390"," It's not surprising to me that the intelligence services didn't see it coming."
"2434510","2435910"," Whether they did or didn't."
"2436590","2442430"," And even if they did, I mean, can you imagine the amount of chatter that comes through for Cross"
"2442430","2444910"," that border at all times. "
"2445130","2447510"," I'm sure between the rocket attacks, there were all the time."
"2447650","2452490"," I'm sure that there's always plans to do this and plans to do that and plans to do this."
"2452750","2453670"," It's always a plan. "
"2455750","2457090"," It's not as bad as it said."
"2457190","2463730"," I know it's bad, but it's not the instruction wasn't as bad as being portrayed in terms of."
"2466310","2471330"," The whole system of defense, there was built for that kind of in that kind of insurgency. "
"2472790","2474490"," So it kind of worked."
"2474970","2481570"," The defense, even though it's terrible when people died and civilians that were caught in what took"
"2481570","2488570"," place, it's functioned as it was intended to function the border between Gaza and the rest of"
"2488570","2489050"," Israel."
"2489310","2491550"," So that's hard to say too. "
"2491650","2492730"," It's brutal to say that."
"2492730","2502630"," Now, saying all that, saying all that, if I was the US military, well, this is a"
"2502630","2502910"," boon."
"2503170","2505250"," And if anything, let these people, this is horrible to say. "
"2506090","2509990"," But let them say what they want to say and do what they want to say and do what they"
"2509990","2513570"," did because it gives carte blanche to the US."
"2513750","2518510"," It gives carte blanche to Israel in a window of do whatever the fuck you need or want to do,"
"2519550","2521290"," which is horrible to say, but it's true."
"2521290","2531210"," And from this point forward, if they have that carte blanche to do whatever they want to do,"
"2532190","2536830"," that's where it opens up the unknowns to our US market. "
"2537590","2540070"," You don't know how other countries are going to react to this."
"2540190","2542010"," You don't know how Hezbollah is going to react."
"2542150","2547110"," You don't know how Iran is going to react in Russia and sympathy. "
"2548210","2550390"," I'm not taking Israel's side here."
"2550470","2557450"," I'm saying just sympathy towards not Israel, but towards if you start to see pictures of civilians,"
"2559610","2561210"," Palestinians being caught in this."
"2563570","2566570"," We don't know what how that impacts the United States is my point. "
"2566870","2572050"," And so if you start to see any kind of terrorism or terrorist acts taking place out there over the"
"2572050","2575070"," coming days or weeks, that will impact our stock market."
"2575070","2581630"," So you should be on you should somewhat be you should somewhat be on a"
"2581630","2585830"," posture of."
"2588410","2592690"," So right now you can see this bounce on the hourly trigger right just so you can see it here. "
"2593230","2594790"," You saw this bounce in the early trigger."
"2594910","2599990"," We're now coming up to confirm if we're going to break below the hourly trigger."
"2599990","2606650"," So you you want to pay attention to this if you're a seller and pay attention to this zone right"
"2606650","2606890"," here. "
"2606930","2607350"," It's importance."
"2609230","2610970"," Now you heard what I had to say."
"2610970","2612430"," I think you're going to bounce around today. "
"2612510","2615910"," I think this I think you're I think we do this up here."
"2616990","2621270"," We just go into a wait and see mode for the coming days."
"2621870","2625010"," So the next one to three sessions, maybe the entire week. "
"2625630","2629870"," I'm going to expect the sideways action, hedge the market."
"2630090","2637910"," And if nothing happens, if you don't see an expansion of war, if you don't see an expansion"
"2637910","2642490"," dragging in Iran, the market will likely continue to go higher."
"2643370","2648650"," But somewhere in here, somewhere in here, you should be hedge yourself. "
"2649770","2657930"," Our market is likely going to, in my view, likely going to trade sideways and be weak until we find"
"2657930","2664370"," out more information until you find out what Israel is going to do."
"2665950","2667090"," What's their plan?"
"2667270","2668390"," We know what their plan is."
"2668470","2669830"," They have 300,000 troops. "
"2670770","2674110"," And when you turn that shit on, it never bodes well."
"2674430","2677550"," So in my view, in my experience, it doesn't bode well."
"2677550","2680950"," If you if you call up some of your troops, that's one thing. "
"2681090","2683570"," But if you got you, they got planes coming in from around the world."
"2684130","2686130"," Around the world planes coming in."
"2687370","2690670"," According to dual citizens coming back to Israel. "
"2690930","2693950"," GDP ratio is a serious element of vulnerability."
"2695530","2697350"," We escalate like that."
"2697710","2698550"," I don't. "
"2700810","2702190"," It doesn't bode well."
"2702590","2702790"," So."
"2705850","2706870"," Yeah, I don't. "
"2706970","2708070"," I'm not saying walls don't work."
"2708450","2712250"," I don't know if you're talking with someone else in the chat if what walls do or don't work."
"2712890","2717330"," I'm just expressing the two types or different types of. "
"2718470","2719510"," Defense of."
"2720510","2721390"," Defense of."
"2722130","2723270"," Structures and. "
"2724030","2725690"," I'm only I'm trying to say to you is."
"2726390","2727290"," That there."
"2727810","2729950"," There are tactics different tactics that are used. "
"2730810","2734230"," In terms of how you stem the flow of."
"2734770","2736290"," What took place this past weekend."
"2739800","2743220"," Yeah, I'm not saying that walls don't work or walls do work. "
"2743220","2744060"," I'm saying this is."
"2744620","2748500"," Exactly how they set up their defenses there was exactly how."
"2748960","2750980"," This is sponsored by to the same. "
"2751480","2753040"," Very similar point works."
"2753240","2757820"," And market profile levels by signing up to the tick.com."
"2757820","2762060"," That's a news that's a new squacker from financial juice in the background."
"2766710","2768250"," It should be so. "
"2768470","2772150"," Yeah, so career low me explain what career low is talking about here so."
"2772530","2776950"," What you should see right the behavior you should see in the stock market today."
"2777970","2781370"," Is you'll see hedging flows come in the market will be weak. "
"2782350","2783890"," Right from those hedging flows."
"2784410","2787430"," And then you'll see you'll see the market rise."
"2789050","2792190"," After those hedging flows command you'll see rounds of hedging flows command. "
"2792470","2795130"," The markets will will rise against those hedging flows."
"2796150","2802570"," And then if you see an event in the market or event in the world that impacts our markets directly."
"2803630","2808590"," You will then see real money selling and quick moves to the downside. "
"2810070","2813550"," But you will not see the market crash from those hedging flows."
"2814190","2814750"," You are correct."
"2817150","2820490"," And we have a propensity to go up in a big way. "
"2821030","2826030"," If nothing happens we're an expansion of of hostilities in the Middle East."
"2826430","2829690"," Yes, you will see the market go higher once those are removed."
"2830470","2832490"," Once that once that risk is removed. "
"2832890","2837850"," This is all based on just unknowns."
"2838770","2843090"," I don't want to say that some of these things they don't want to say because I think it instills."
"2844170","2845810"," I think it stills. "
"2846910","2848790"," Fear that is unwarranted."
"2850250","2854070"," So if there was a terrorist attack in the United States, I don't want to say I shouldn't say that,"
"2854110","2854730"," but if there was."
"2856690","2862990"," You shouldn't have that irrational fear of that happening, but there's potential for it. "
"2864570","2866250"," When we're in these situations."
"2876890","2878750"," Yeah, yeah, the tool is pretty cool, right?"
"2880650","2884860"," So, let's see what you guys are saying here."
"2887340","2891860"," It's very similar to, it's very similar to end of quarter flows. "
"2893040","2894880"," The same flow should be very similar."
"2895280","2898200"," The only difference, the only difference I would say on these flows would be."
"2899080","2903000"," I don't know that they're running these flows out with zero date calls yet. "
"2903000","2905140"," I'll probably know by end of day, I'll be told."
"2906580","2912000"," I've got a service that tells me what kind of hedging flows come in, or what kind of hedging flows"
"2912000","2912520"," come into the market."
"2913280","2916700"," It's all I won't know till the end of the day, but I'm assuming there will be it. "
"2916880","2918060"," Oh, there will be all day long today."
"2924110","2925710"," Yeah, I think Carillo knows that."
"2925910","2931310"," I think Carillo knows that those hedging flows rarely pay out, but they do. "
"2933330","2938990"," Inevitably, you're being given those that chance data hedge that those possibilities."
"2942300","2944280"," Yeah, and then we will squeeze on that."
"2944380","2944920"," Well, that's the other thing. "
"2945280","2949980"," So cobweb saying buying hedges really work out for those position squeezes happen."
"2950360","2953380"," We don't know also if those hedges are coming in."
"2954660","2959880"," And they're being countered with zero date call flow, which could be happening as well today. "
"2959880","2966020"," So you could see squeezes in the end of the day over those call flow over those hedging flows."
"2966280","2970540"," You don't know what we don't know how they're hedging the market here, but I would expect the"
"2970540","2972260"," market to get hedged without a doubt."
"2972560","2974880"," You just can't ignore it. "
"2975600","2977320"," It behooves you as an investor."
"2978220","2982620"," You've been presented with potential volatility that impacts the world."
"2988730","2991190"," Let me read through what you're saying here. "
"2995670","2997190"," Yeah, there's no speaker right now."
"2997270","2997750"," I saw that."
"3000530","3002010"," We're going to look at USL. "
"3002170","3002850"," We'll look at USL."
"3002930","3004070"," We'll look at Brent today."
"3005170","3006530"," We'll look at XLE. "
"3007150","3008470"," Matter of fact, Excel."
"3009290","3010850"," Did XLRE bounce this morning?"
"3011790","3013010"," I know that we were looking at."
"3013750","3016890"," I thought XLRE either held or bounced this morning. "
"3016990","3023130"," We'll take a look at some of the sectors that were really destroyed in this last downside move."
"3023590","3028070"," Because some of those sectors are up this morning or didn't sell in the overnight."
"3028370","3033950"," We'll take a look at a few of those sectors this morning and see if they give us some insight. "
"3033950","3043570"," Another ticker that gave some insight on Friday was Nvidia has already gone up and broken"
"3043570","3048630"," above its daily and weekly trap on Friday."
"3048630","3051670"," That was given you kind of an indication we shouldn't crash over the weekend."
"3052130","3052690"," We didn't. "
"3054730","3056350"," Nvidia was an indicator."
"3056350","3062250"," So you're looking for places that were either completely sold to zero sectors that were completely"
"3062250","3064930"," sold to zero into last week."
"3065510","3070290"," And you're looking for risk on behaviors in the market like NVDA. "
"3070590","3071970"," And you saw those that on Friday."
"3072290","3077530"," So into Friday, at least there were great signs that the market's going to turn to the upside."
"3078850","3085790"," So just putting hedging on does not like expect the market to crash, but it is prudent to do. "
"3089480","3092960"," Just to give you more caffeine saying he can share hedging flows in discord."
"3093680","3094540"," Fuck yeah dude."
"3095320","3096000"," Share them. "
"3097100","3098440"," I haven't, I got to check here."
"3098540","3102000"," I'm going to check here in a little bit, but yeah, definitely share those in discord."
"3105720","3107620"," Yeah, and Blissowitz making a comment right now. "
"3107780","3108920"," I hate negative gamma or hate."
"3109160","3110600"," I actually love negative gamma land."
"3111100","3111640"," I do too. "
"3111940","3117720"," If you, if we're in positive gamma, we grind right slowly to the upside when we're in negative"
"3117720","3118100"," gamma."
"3118220","3121920"," It's where all the build, the meat of the trade is made even to the upside."
"3125030","3126390"," Yeah, I agree with that tubeless wits. "
"3130590","3131910"," Now I can't mess with religion."
"3132170","3133250"," It's definitely as a losing conversation."
"3133290","3134090"," I agree with that. "
"3137100","3139620"," Yeah, I can't stay away from it."
"3139780","3142300"," It's, it's not just real."
"3142420","3146260"," And we had the fucked up part is a lot of this in the Middle East isn't just religion either,"
"3146260","3146600"," right?"
"3146600","3148460"," A lot of it has to do with poverty. "
"3149960","3150420"," Education."
"3152720","3153180"," Inbreeding."
"3153880","3155040"," We don't want to say that, but it's true. "
"3157740","3158820"," It's really frustrating."
"3159300","3161020"," And then, and then of course political."
"3165170","3168970"," Political and power moves using certain peoples for those kind of things. "
"3169750","3174330"," It's the dynamics of it are like the dynamics are."
"3175490","3179490"," It's like a fucking minefield that you can't win, right?"
"3179850","3181150"," Say one thing and you say another."
"3181450","3184130"," You bring another thing up and you bring something else up. "
"3184230","3186890"," You bring something else up and it's just a dog shit pile."
"3187490","3190190"," And you're just going to get become mired in it, right?"
"3190830","3196830"," And then you get accused of, you know, taking any fucking side."
"3197030","3198710"," It doesn't fucking matter what side you take. "
"3199470","3199530"," Right?"
"3199670","3200190"," You're the bad guy."
"3200510","3202270"," So it's like, what do you do?"
"3202430","3202850"," What do you say?"
"3202850","3203370"," You can't."
"3203510","3208410"," You can just, all you can do is react or prepare that kind of stuff. "
"3209270","3215270"," Or at least from my perspective, I'm like white middle class, white guy living in the middle west"
"3215270","3216270"," of the United States."
"3217130","3218630"," Like what the fuck do I have to say on this?"
"3219110","3226270"," Not much unless it directly can impact my life, right?"
"3226510","3228550"," Or even if it's indirectly impact my life."
"3231090","3232210"," Hey, Dan, how you doing, brother?"
"3234810","3244290"," Yeah, it's, um, yeah, I sat once on a, you know, shit, my wife was in the army, right?"
"3246170","3247490"," My wife was in the army. "
"3247610","3248650"," I met my wife in the army."
"3249310","3257590"," And she, you know, I was with, I was stationed with her, but she's been, who's a group of men"
"3257590","3259390"," that tried to buy my wife at one time."
"3260370","3266950"," One time we were, we were stationed somewhere where we saw a nine year old girl that was pregnant"
"3266950","3271410"," on a street corner, you know, like a child and it was no big deal. "
"3272030","3276850"," Like as an American, you have, it's even in our most, maybe some data, I've been on some"
"3276850","3284150"," reservations that look pretty fucking rough in the US, but even the most poor, poor Americans, uh,"
"3285990","3290910"," there can be depravity, but not like I've seen in, in some, like, I call them fourth, fifth world"
"3290910","3293670"," countries and places like that kind of a private."
"3293810","3301150"," It's just like a norm and, um, Americans don't, all oftentimes American civilians don't know how"
"3301150","3302310"," good they actually have it."
"3305640","3306260"," Thanks, Jimmy. "
"3306540","3311220"," So getting more caffeine just shared, uh, hedging flows coming in today, uh, into the marketplace."
"3311360","3312280"," I appreciate that brother."
"3313480","3317020"," Uh, inside the discord in the main, uh, chat, the general chat, I believe. "
"3319060","3320120"," I appreciate that game."
"3320260","3320460"," We're caffeine."
"3321460","3321840"," Yeah. "
"3322060","3323700"," You see, H Y G is blasting, right?"
"3324220","3325680"," Blasting right off the open this morning."
"3326400","3328460"," Uh, blasting on the open this morning."
"3333800","3334180"," Yeah. "
"3334360","3335060"," The armies are where it plays."
"3335360","3336200"," I was just talking to Joe."
"3336380","3339200"," Oh, so the reason I was late this morning was I was talking to Joe Donut, Jimmy. "
"3339560","3345300"," And, um, you know, it's a bizarre because I have mixed feelings in the military."
"3345300","3350680"," Like, uh, I didn't, um, I could have went down the, I almost did."
"3350800","3351360"," There was a time in life. "
"3351380","3355140"," I almost didn't get on that whole like I ended up going to council and yoga and all this other"
"3355140","3355460"," shit."
"3356300","3360800"," Um, you can, there's a trap for veterans, uh, where you never leave the bar still."
"3361100","3361700"," Come back from more. "
"3361720","3362560"," You come back from the army."
"3363240","3364360"," Wherever is Navy Marines."
"3364360","3365020"," Doesn't matter. "
"3365600","3368520"," And you live, you keep, you never leave that life."
"3368720","3370160"," You stay in that military life."
"3371100","3372820"," Um, you never escape it. "
"3372820","3374620"," A lot of, a lot of veterans have that."
"3376380","3378540"," Um, and normally it doesn't work out well."
"3378940","3381660"," Uh, and some veterans never, they leave it behind. "
"3382320","3383380"," It's like a door that you close."
"3383620","3387600"," And even in my life, my counselor and I, it's like, there are some things in life."
"3387760","3389140"," You gotta, uh, you fucking bury. "
"3389640","3392440"," Like literally you close the door and you move on."
"3392580","3393320"," You live a new life."
"3393520","3394680"," Try to get a second new life. "
"3395560","3397300"," Um, the military is a weird place."
"3397380","3401300"," So you got like, um, military is a weird place."
"3401300","3403500"," Like, uh, it's filled with people. "
"3404120","3409000"," Like 70% of the military is, uh, the unwanted diverse society."
"3409860","3413440"," You know, um, the military is filled."
"3413720","3419780"," Like 70%, about 70% is filled with, um, people that society didn't want. "
"3419960","3421720"," You either, you didn't do well in school."
"3422100","3423060"," You didn't have too many prospects."
"3423960","3425660"," You can't, uh, the number of soldiers that I met. "
"3426000","3427720"," I never heard the stories that I heard."
"3428760","3429780"," And I didn't believe them at first."
"3429780","3430780"," And I first joined the army. "
"3431320","3435900"," Some of the stories that I heard from friends, soldiers, uh, that I was very close with."
"3436580","3440960"," Uh, you know, initially I don't, you don't, but I didn't believe some of the stories they would"
"3440960","3441380"," tell me."
"3441880","3442860"," Uh, what they left. "
"3443740","3446480"," And the only people that would take them was the military, right?"
"3447200","3456960"," Uh, off of them a career, off of them, no, um, uh, no class or race or, um, uh, uh,"
"3458800","3464660"," any kind of a, like, uh, like a societal, uh, uh, well, it's not just racism."
"3465060","3469160"," It's like, um, it's like the last chance, right?"
"3469380","3470060"," Like I grew up in this."
"3470260","3470900"," I grew up with this. "
"3471020","3474840"," My brother, my father, my mother, my neighborhood, wherever it was, my school sucked."
"3475180","3479720"," I did this to that, but the military took me in and they only cared about the color green, right?"
"3480500","3481300"," I didn't care about the color of my skin."
"3481500","3482860"," I didn't care about what I do outside. "
"3483280","3484540"," I didn't care about my background."
"3485240","3486420"," You're given the same opportunities."
"3488080","3496180"," They say, you know, as anyone else out there, there's cadres built in the military on, um, on the"
"3496180","3499460"," fact that the United States hasn't always been the place for everybody to get a leg up in the"
"3499460","3499640"," world. "
"3500020","3502320"," The military is a place that you can join."
"3503060","3507660"," And if you do a good job, you can, uh, change your life."
"3507840","3512820"," You can leave the military, um, have, uh, great care, not great. "
"3513080","3513780"," I think I call it bad."
"3513780","3517120"," It's bad care, but, um, you can leave with a pension."
"3517120","3518740"," You can leave with college opportunities. "
"3519000","3521000"," You can leave with people to buy a house, get a job."
"3521580","3526720"," Um, you're very employable when you leave the military, uh, most, in most circumstances, but you do"
"3526720","3530460"," come out damaged oftentimes physical, mental, spiritual, all that."
"3530640","3532320"," You, you, you carry all that with you when you leave. "
"3539620","3545000"," Um, yeah, that doesn't happen."
"3545100","3545660"," No, either, right?"
"3546660","3547020"," Yeah."
"3548120","3548560"," Yeah. "
"3557070","3559410"," I'm going to go into the, uh, CDOE press conference."
"3559530","3559830"," It's zero dates."
"3559970","3562510"," No, I've got some, uh, I've got some puts on for Wednesday. "
"3562830","3564270"," I've got a bunch of calls."
"3564630","3566090"," I'm still along this market."
"3566090","3567450"," I'm not exiting that trade. "
"3568150","3575450"," I've got a 300, uh, 300, uh, call spreads for, um, December 29th."
"3576890","3578270"," Uh, this is how I make the money."
"3578430","3581190"," This is like, this is how Captain James makes his money trade. "
"3581190","3584650"," Um, so just for today, uh, probably won't be doing that."
"3585370","3592390"," Um, I'm in a, if you want to know what my, or my stances here is, uh, very cautious."
"3592990","3598410"," Um, I'm very cautious, um, in case something were to happen, that's unexpected. "
"3598630","3602510"," And that's my biggest fear, like waking up tomorrow morning and some fucked up."
"3602830","3606350"," Some really fucked up happens that either drags us into, uh, further."
"3607610","3610350"," Further involved in from those sanctions on Iran oil. "
"3617740","3618220"," Yeah."
"3618520","3618680"," Yeah."
"3618940","3619240"," Yeah. "
"3619660","3620140"," Synchronicity."
"3620480","3622640"," Uh, I joined, uh, not for those reasons."
"3623000","3626320"," Um, there's like 70% of our, our military force made up of those people. "
"3626560","3629180"," Then there's like another, you know, like 20%."
"3629940","3637040"," 25% that are joining for, um, they didn't have any of that stuff, but they didn't have support to"
"3637040","3638180"," get a college education."
"3638920","3640160"," Uh, I see that a lot. "
"3640160","3641600"," People joined for that."
"3641780","3643780"," And then there's a percentage that joined for a country."
"3644780","3648260"," Uh, and there's a percentage that joined for their family history. "
"3648980","3650600"," Uh, and that's, that was my case."
"3651040","3652460"," I started bouncing right now."
"3652500","3654020"," You can see this bounce off of. "
"3655500","3657040"," Let me see if we put this back here."
"3657240","3657520"," Hold on here."
"3658180","3658820"," Go on out with that. "
"3659800","3660580"," We'll just leave that."
"3662740","3667660"," So sellers were looking for the rejection off of the one and five minute trigger."
"3667660","3671040"," With no rejection here, we should squeeze. "
"3672000","3673120"," Uh, we should actually trade."
"3681760","3685300"," We should trade this here and, uh, trade to the upside."
"3686260","3691420"," Uh, so, uh, some, a lot of people joined the military too, because they're fathers, fathers,"
"3691720","3692640"," fathers, fathers. "
"3693460","3694580"," You know, that kind of stuff, right?"
"3694740","3696260"," My mother, my father."
"3700520","3704060"," Uh, and that's, that's why I joined my family history."
"3704060","3711120"," Uh, my brother is still, uh, in the, my brother is in the government. "
"3711720","3714140"," My, uh, dad was in the government."
"3714400","3715900"," My father-in-law was in the government."
"3716160","3718520"," My grandfather, my uncles, my great uncles. "
"3719280","3719600"," Everybody."
"3720040","3722440"," Matter of fact, I didn't, I never thought I was joining the army."
"3723480","3726620"," Uh, I joined literally like woke up. "
"3727720","3729540"," That's true, like 100% true."
"3730200","3732340"," I literally woke up one day."
"3733700","3736220"," And, uh, felt like I wasn't a man. "
"3736620","3737080"," I'll be honest."
"3737660","3743840"," Like, it felt like I wasn't doing, uh, what my father, my, my dad did."
"3744280","3753520"," Um, I owed a duty to, uh, I owed a duty to my nation for, um, living up to what"
"3753520","3755660"," it says it wants to be. "
"3756740","3759360"," Um, so it wasn't political in any way, shape, or form."
"3759360","3760480"," It was apolitical."
"3760920","3769380"," It was more of, uh, it isn't free to be, uh, to aspire to be, uh, great. "
"3769740","3773860"," I know that we fail a lot as a nation, uh, being that country."
"3774440","3776880"," Uh, I, of course you'll hear me."
"3777120","3777960"," You know that I'm a Democrat. "
"3778400","3782900"," You guys know that, um, I get disappointed all the time."
"3783520","3788300"," Um, but I felt like I owed, uh, my dad, I owed my country."
"3788300","3793540"," I owed, um, what, what we can be good at, you know?"
"3794200","3799420"," Uh, I was telling you guys a story a couple of weeks ago about, um, how I read a post"
"3799420","3802960"," on Reddit where someone had asked, uh, why would you join our military?"
"3803780","3807160"," Uh, for how fucked up our country is. "
"3807460","3812660"," And the truth is we need those people to be in our military."
"3812960","3817960"," You know, that's how you turn into, um, like a country."
"3817960","3826760"," Like, um, Nazi Germany was when you don't have, uh, the right people in positions of leadership or"
"3826760","3828160"," authority or power. "
"3828740","3835120"," Um, so, uh, you know, I don't know what that means to you, but, um, for me, that's why I"
"3835120","3835360"," joined."
"3835540","3840280"," So I joined our military because I wanted a better, uh, future for you and I."
"3840600","3845560"," Like when we, when you and I are old or the next generation or, uh, we dealt with slavery in"
"3845560","3846320"," this country, right?"
"3846320","3849700"," We still have a lot of stuff in this country that has to be dealt with, right?"
"3850600","3853540"," Um, so you kind of have to be that person."
"3854080","3859640"," You know, uh, our military will always need those people, um, in it. "
"3860100","3864520"," I'm actually a firm believer in some kind of a draft."
"3865420","3870420"," Uh, even if you don't join the military, uh, that you would spend like two years."
"3871180","3878480"," Or four years, uh, Peace Corps, road cleanup, believe it or not, um, teaching students in America,"
"3878480","3880440"," some kind of ownership. "
"3883300","3887320"," We were you, uh, give to your country and to people, humanity."
"3888620","3889580"," Uh, in some fashion."
"3890420","3895020"," Uh, and so that you feel like you own part of our country or even the world. "
"3896060","3896300"," Right."
"3896300","3902780"," If you spent time, I don't know how much volunteering you guys do in real life, but it's"
"3902780","3903280"," fascinating."
"3903640","3909160"," I went out and cleaned up, um, I went out and did some, uh, trash cleaning, uh, recently. "
"3910020","3915580"," And, uh, when you go out and do trash cleaning, like to clean up a neighborhood or a road or"
"3915580","3919360"," something like that, it's very powerful and moving when you're the one doing that."
"3919860","3925980"," If you're, if you're working a soup kitchen for people that can't eat, if you've ever donated your"
"3925980","3927440"," actual time, not money."
"3928600","3936400"," Time, uh, where you become invested, uh, it makes you, it does alter your behavior. "
"3937120","3944480"," There's some alter alteration in your behavior and in your, um, how you view things."
"3944780","3948480"," Trust me, if you go and you, you go clean up a neighborhood, right?"
"3949840","3951680"," You're going to think about that, right?"
"3951680","3954940"," You see a dirty street or trash on the sidewalk."
"3956340","3959020"," You're going to pick it up, um, because you're out there. "
"3959220","3961980"," You're, you're putting your time and your effort into that, that cleanup."
"3962980","3963380"," Right?"
"3967240","3967640"," Yeah."
"3967840","3970480"," Well, I always said that about the, uh, Marines, right?"
"3970800","3972200"," So I tried to set up the Marines. "
"3972940","3974000"," They weren't having it."
"3974440","3976020"," They were like, you're not for us."
"3976180","3977540"," They're like, you should go to the army. "
"3979520","3984040"," I think when I tried to join the Marines, they were like, well, we think you're, we think you're,"
"3984080","3984700"," you're, you're good."
"3984880","3987540"," You'd be great at this, but we think you think too much."
"3987560","3988540"," We think you're too smart. "
"3989360","3990060"," That's what happened."
"3990500","3994240"," I was, I like tested, didn't, I don't think I missed a single question in the ASVAB."
"3994680","3998220"," I was in college, uh, then they put me in D lab and a whole bunch of other testing. "
"3999180","4003520"," Blue through all, I blew through two or three higher tests, but I was more like an army guy."
"4003620","4008520"," They were like, uh, we need, we need the Marines are like, we need people to not question orders"
"4008520","4009700"," and to charge that hill."
"4010020","4010880"," No matter what. "
"4010880","4012380"," The bullets are fine."
"4013080","4014540"," Will you go up there no matter what?"
"4014700","4016160"," What right wrong doesn't matter."
"4019320","4020960"," I'll give it to a Marine for that. "
"4021240","4022280"," Like 100%."
"4032320","4033960"," You think too much exactly."
"4035280","4036780"," You don't want thinkers in the Marines. "
"4037120","4037780"," You want doers."
"4038620","4041640"," You want to be, you want some of the follows orders no matter what."
"4045800","4052220"," Squeezing higher now, trying to trade up to 429.40. Trust you can get back up there. "
"4052340","4054360"," We got breaking above right now."
"4054500","4055760"," This previous high right here."
"4055900","4057620"," Follow, follow my cursor here. "
"4058420","4060180"," You're watching price break above this one."
"4060800","4062320"," Now you've got your next one here."
"4062540","4064120"," This is all positive for bulls. "
"4067120","4068500"," You got this one right here."
"4071230","4072450"," You're going to head up to the next."
"4072450","4075630"," It's a kind of wonky looking butt. "
"4078880","4080620"," You can see we can show that better there."
"4081960","4083460"," I hope maybe right here."
"4087780","4089980"," Squeezing higher now, playing ping pong this morning. "
"4091420","4095100"," Just bouncing from that weekly trigger all the way back down to this hourly trigger."
"4095939","4096819"," And then we're heading higher."
"4097740","4099960"," Yeah, I got that hourly trigger right. "
"4101279","4101779"," A little bit higher."
"4103920","4105180"," A little bit sloppy."
"4114420","4117120"," Let's see if we can bring this down a little bit for you so you can see it here. "
"4118279","4119500"," That will help you see it."
"4132460","4134080"," Hold on Jimmy, I'm reading through right now, brother."
"4134260","4135200"," I'm trying to get through all the comments. "
"4137640","4140760"," Yeah, like when we're in a rush to invade, my calls got evaporated over the weekend."
"4141560","4146040"," Yeah, if we were, if we were, if we were oversold right now, we would have sold the fuck out"
"4146040","4146580"," of this market."
"4146580","4149439"," It would have been like, steps of hell. "
"4154100","4157500"," Yeah, the only strategy human race has failed in play is the war of love, man."
"4157620","4158640"," Yeah, 100% man."
"4158819","4163520"," It's like greed, politics, money, even religion kind of stems from that. "
"4163800","4171020"," Well, not stems, but you guys know, you guys have heard me talk in the past about, you know, they"
"4171020","4172479"," like, you got gods, right?"
"4172819","4175439"," You got myths, gods, and you've got religion."
"4175439","4184180"," And you had the rise of democracy, the rise of socialism, then you had the rise of the industrial"
"4184180","4184680"," age."
"4185540","4192420"," They eventually came in, you saw corporations take over, now you've got, now you've got oligarchs"
"4192420","4193200"," taking over. "
"4194140","4197740"," You've got, matter of fact, we have American oligarchs, then we've got Russian oligarchs."
"4198380","4204880"," You've got oil oligarchs, you've got all these very small, powerful groups of people, right?"
"4204880","4213720"," They're likely working in the background using people as, using people as pawns, right?"
"4220490","4222890"," Yeah, there's nothing like using your time."
"4223330","4224730"," There's nothing like it. "
"4225670","4226970"," It changes people."
"4228410","4230410"," It changes you for the rest of your life."
"4230670","4233610"," You'll never, and especially when you're young, it's so impressionable. "
"4233610","4238750"," Like, this one good thing, the military knows that about young people, they'll go to war, and"
"4238750","4241690"," they'll die and not understand the consequences of what they're doing."
"4242330","4244510"," Either at the moment or even down the road when they're older."
"4244890","4246950"," The same thing applies, though, in a positive light. "
"4247270","4252870"," So if you were to send a 16, 17-year-old, 18-year-old kid, or if they deferred until"
"4252870","4258350"," they graduated college to put in a couple of years teaching students, changes you as a person,"
"4258350","4258750"," right?"
"4258930","4262370"," When you give selflessly of yourself, fully of yourself."
"4262370","4265450"," You can fully give yourself selflessly for a period of time."
"4266610","4270630"," My own personal opinion is that it makes you a better person for the rest of you. "
"4270710","4274330"," There can be positive aspects that last a lifetime for you."
"4278050","4282890"," According to coin desk bit stampers and talks with EU banks and seeking to use crypto."
"4283930","4285650"," Yeah, there is something to be said here. "
"4285910","4287170"," We'll say this this morning."
"4287250","4288310"," I'm going to read some stuff to you."
"4291670","4293570"," We're going to talk about long-term yields. "
"4294490","4296210"," We'll talk about a 10-year at some point."
"4296430","4297830"," We're going to take a look at the 10-year right now."
"4298430","4298870"," Hold on here. "
"4298990","4299890"," I'm going to take a peek in the background."
"4307570","4308850"," Just give me a quick break here."
"4308950","4310010"," I've got to look at the 10-year yield. "
"4319220","4321080"," This stream is sponsored by Ticksright."

"4329780","4332620"," There's still some upward movement that could possibly take place. "
"4332900","4334220"," Let me see if I can switch this over."
"4335880","4337180"," Let me move this over here."
"4352910","4353490"," Excuse me. "
"4353830","4355270"," So here's the 10-year yield."
"4361020","4362860"," Now, not out of the woods yet, right?"
"4364460","4372280"," If you're looking for out of B2B out of the woods, the yield's coming down right now."
"4373000","4380760"," That's 4.6%. So that implies some kind of an upward movement in the market, because we are tied"
"4380760","4383060"," right now to the yield. "
"4383860","4386600"," And bull's looking for rejection more downside."
"4388520","4390400"," So let me scale this out a little bit for you here."
"4396950","4403050"," If you start to see this breakdown turn into some consolidation behavior here, you should give the"
"4403050","4404090"," markets a reprieve. "
"4404090","4413750"," But you most definitely do not want to see a bounce here that 4.5% and start running up"
"4413750","4414410"," again, right?"
"4414670","4422170"," So there could be some folly here or a muted bull run."
"4422510","4428150"," So even though you get a bull run, you may not get it to where you want it, what you"
"4428150","4430090"," think it's going to be, right?"
"4430090","4439350"," So if you're a bull, you want to see a break of that 4.5%. 4.6%. And you want"
"4439350","4440930"," to see this kind of action here."
"4441770","4447410"," What you don't want to see as a bull is, you know, this get bought here and then start running"
"4447410","4451250"," it up again to that 5%. "
"4451250","4455530"," If you start to see that again, if you start to see this kind of a move here, coming in"
"4455530","4458390"," the middle of the month, you know, the bulls could be thwarted, right?"
"4459150","4460890"," So we definitely don't want to see that."
"4461070","4465850"," You want to keep an eye on this 10-year and have a break of trend."
"4467970","4471090"," So you are looking for that break of trend on the US 10-year. "
"4471910","4473670"," It's more upside to the market available."
"4475250","4477730"," Some more upside potential here for some squeezing."
"4480050","4482530"," So if you are bullish here, I understand why. "
"4484770","4487870"," Let's go to a 30-minute chart instead or a 1-minute chart."
"4488910","4492060"," The main screen here."
"4493880","4494600"," Hold on here. "
"4505100","4505820"," There we go."
"4518110","4520010"," You guys can't see it like that's better."
"4520650","4521370"," Does that help better?"
"4525830","4529480"," Slide that over so you can see it better. "
"4542080","4543840"," Yeah, I saw TLT this morning."
"4544080","4546040"," I saw the CTAs saying that as well."
"4546200","4548080"," That was Goldman Sachs saying that about CTAs, right?"
"4548600","4549400"," You didn't write that. "
"4549500","4550120"," It's Goldman Sachs."
"4554750","4555890"," What else we got here?"
"4558950","4560890"," Oh, yeah, the Detroit Underground fights."
"4561350","4565090"," Okay, so Detroit Underground fights. "
"4565370","4566810"," I went to Friday night."
"4568070","4568950"," Who said that?"
"4568950","4570370"," Who brought that up?"
"4571070","4574570"," Brad, I went to Detroit Fight Club on Friday."
"4574950","4578110"," I was supposed to go two weeks ago, but I got the date wrong or not me, but the person"
"4578110","4580290"," that had me going, had the date wrong. "
"4582230","4585190"," Supposedly, my friends know these people that put this stuff on."
"4586350","4587750"," I suck all like a sore thumb."
"4588130","4588670"," I'll say that. "
"4588930","4590110"," I suck all like a sore thumb."
"4590330","4592050"," They probably thought I was a cop or something."
"4592930","4596410"," Luckily, I knew the people doing it. "
"4596410","4605690"," So I was able to meet some really cool engineers that make videos about this,"
"4605690","4607150"," put it on the Internet."
"4607690","4610790"," They've got like a big Instagram presence and YouTube presence."
"4611050","4614210"," They make professional video make and these are black magic cameras and stuff. "
"4614790","4616210"," Some really cool Canon lenses."
"4617690","4619670"," I was able to meet the people that throw it."
"4620050","4621590"," I met a bunch of rappers. "
"4622410","4623070"," That's true."
"4623330","4623770"," I got pictures."
"4624510","4629110"," I met some famous rappers out there. "
"4629970","4631930"," When I went to this, they were really cool."
"4632130","4633370"," I think it was two."
"4633650","4634210"," I was multi-fold. "
"4634710","4635950"," I suck all like a sore thumb."
"4636130","4636990"," I'm a fucking white guy."
"4637950","4641010"," I'm in at least maybe preface. "
"4641150","4645490"," Bear with me here when I say this because I'm not trying to sound bad, okay?"
"4649790","4659590"," Detroit has been known as a safe place for African Americans for a long"
"4659590","4660770"," time since Civil War."
"4661510","4663250"," They had underground railroads here."
"4664470","4667630"," You had, of course, mass racism in the United States. "
"4668870","4672630"," And you have an industry that was in Detroit specifically."
"4673110","4678830"," So if you were African American, you could come here for either vacation, a good time, or work,"
"4679150","4679890"," believe it or not."
"4680550","4685710"," Now, Ford was a fucking racist, but he didn't mind your work in form. "
"4685990","4691050"," So Detroit was a place where you could get a job and they had a great African American culture"
"4691050","4691430"," here."
"4691870","4698770"," Regardless of what's happened in Detroit, going back historically, the bad shit that's happened in"
"4698770","4705790"," Detroit, African Americans have built themselves their own culture and society in this town, which"
"4705790","4706910"," is fascinating."
"4707670","4715670"," And for all the negative shit that's happened to black people in our country, I'm assuming at some"
"4715670","4717130"," point they just said, fuck it. "
"4717450","4718830"," We're going to make our own culture."
"4719270","4719850"," And they did."
"4720690","4722830"," And it's not easy. "
"4723410","4730890"," I don't think that it's easy as a white man in the United States to be able to experience that"
"4730890","4731230"," culture."
"4731230","4736430"," You experience parts of it, but not a lot of African American culture."
"4737170","4744050"," And I've been welcomed and have become very close friends with some African Americans here in"
"4744050","4744310"," Detroit. "
"4745030","4746350"," And they're my family."
"4746810","4747810"," They're my friends."
"4748070","4748650"," They're my family. "
"4748830","4750990"," They'll be my family to the day that I die."
"4751470","4757650"," These are people that will be part of my family and invite them over to my home for Christmas and"
"4757650","4758710"," all kinds of holidays."
"4758710","4760150"," Our children play together. "
"4760890","4761810"," They're friends."
"4762250","4764670"," My kids don't know what that shit is like Ray."
"4764870","4768750"," They probably do have some slight like everybody's got some fucking racism. "
"4769490","4771270"," My kids don't know any of that shit."
"4771970","4781410"," And I am so grateful to my friends that I've made here in Detroit to be welcomed into their homes,"
"4781410","4787170"," be trusted in their community, and to be a part of their lives."
"4787170","4791850"," I can't say express that more because I don't know how to express that. "
"4791930","4796970"," It makes me want to cry right now at this moment because I was able to go out this weekend"
"4796970","4799230"," to this Detroit Fight Club."
"4801530","4803550"," And, you know, people are inquisitive."
"4803670","4804210"," They're like, who are you?"
"4804470","4805150"," What are you doing here?"
"4805550","4806030"," What's your name?"
"4806310","4806730"," Who do you know?"
"4807050","4807730"," All this kind of stuff?"
"4808230","4809650"," And more mostly inquisitiveness. "
"4809990","4811230"," You're not supposed to be here."
"4813210","4814750"," And it was fucking awesome."
"4814750","4820310"," You know, it's fascinating when you're there with good intentions. "
"4821950","4824710"," You treat people with respect like they're humans."
"4825450","4826870"," And I was in a great mood."
"4827130","4828530"," So I'm like beating all these new people. "
"4829110","4829890"," I met a bunch of rappers."
"4830310","4834530"," I met some up-and-coming famous boxers that are sanctioned fighters."
"4835650","4836970"," I met just regular people. "
"4837430","4844790"," And it was bizarre because of course everyone's like, who are you?"
"4844910","4845870"," And I'm like, who are you too?"
"4845990","4847610"," I want to meet who all you people are."
"4849610","4855710"," It's shocking because you have an image of how people are supposed to think people are, or that's"
"4855710","4856730"," portrayed in media."
"4857370","4858550"," And these are all normal people. "
"4858730","4862010"," These people have their own boxing association."
"4863310","4864430"," There was no shooting."
"4864770","4865550"," There was no fighting. "
"4868550","4870590"," There were rules to fighting."
"4871130","4879050"," There was, and they, of course, these people are living in the fringes of the law, right?"
"4879250","4881890"," Like this is like a classic Detroit thing, right?"
"4882050","4886610"," Detroit still has illegal speakeasies part of the culture."
"4887530","4893330"," They do their own, they put things together when they can't do it publicly, right?"
"4893630","4894810"," So I thought that was all fascinating. "
"4896050","4898250"," And, you know, they're able to put together a fight."
"4898250","4902590"," Whether you like fights or not, they're able to put together an event that was underground."
"4902750","4904430"," Nobody got shot, stabbed, killed. "
"4904930","4906610"," There was no big brawls in the parking lot."
"4906870","4910050"," No one was out of control, fucked up on drugs or drinking."
"4910790","4915030"," They had an open, they had an open, they had a bar that you could buy drinks from, or bring"
"4915030","4917990"," your own booze with a fee at the door. "
"4919290","4920670"," And there was a fee to get in."
"4920830","4923830"," There was a, you could either buy liquor there or bring your own."
"4924410","4928370"," People were smoking weed everywhere in this place indoors. "
"4928370","4930110"," It was like marijuana smoke everywhere."
"4931090","4932050"," But people were great."
"4932330","4933630"," They had great food. "
"4933950","4935510"," They had great food there."
"4935930","4937210"," They had a boxy grill set up."
"4937230","4938010"," It was baller. "
"4938270","4940230"," And I don't know."
"4940370","4940950"," I had a fucking blast."
"4941730","4942810"," It was so unique. "
"4943670","4945090"," And it was its own thing."
"4945490","4947230"," It didn't remind me of anything else."
"4947930","4949150"," This is a weird thing too. "
"4949290","4954070"," Like if you go down south, southern United States and you eat a low country cuisine, it's one of"
"4954070","4956950"," the most fascinating cuisines in the country."
"4957190","4957670"," It's like food."
"4957910","4960770"," If you're talking food, you're looking for like real American cuisine. "
"4961370","4962030"," You should go down south."
"4963910","4964950"," It's its own thing."
"4965810","4969090"," It's not something that we ripped off from Italy. "
"4969430","4971570"," And now we have the tour of Italy at Olive Garden."
"4972190","4973770"," It was its own fucking thing."
"4974110","4976930"," And I fucking loved it. "
"4977090","4978850"," I thought it was the cats meow."
"4979310","4981150"," And the people were loving."
"4981150","4982110"," They were kind. "
"4983790","4988890"," For every if it was like the needle bouncing off the record at the animal house movie."
"4989850","4993990"," And instead of like beating me up, they were like sitting around the booth with me and we're"
"4993990","4994510"," hanging out."
"4994770","4996650"," And it was a fucking blast. "
"4997410","4998370"," It was a fucking blast."
"4998850","5001750"," I showed up apprehensive."
"5002410","5006530"," And by the time I left, it was just like, hey, I'll see you in a couple of weeks. "
"5007090","5007870"," It was really cool."
"5007870","5010290"," So we're watching this right here."
"5013200","5014320"," It was really cool. "
"5014640","5015700"," And there were rules."
"5016120","5019640"," And there was good sportsmanship by the competitors."
"5020340","5023120"," There were people that there heard that they lost. "
"5024260","5028840"," There was a couple, one guy, there was some weight mismatches in weight class."
"5029820","5033860"," And it wasn't like, let's destroy that person."
"5033860","5041560"," And as a matter of fact, one guy that lost fighting, the guy was outclassed by weight by at least"
"5041560","5042380"," 30 pounds. "
"5042940","5045240"," But he still fought fucking awesome."
"5045620","5046280"," I went up talk to him."
"5046360","5048900"," I was like, dude, you were a fucking baller. "
"5049040","5049620"," Like you were great."
"5049920","5052660"," Good job at fighting tonight."
"5053840","5055300"," And it was awesome. "
"5055540","5062940"," I can't express my gratitude for being trusted to come inside of this community to spend time on a"
"5062940","5063200"," weekend."
"5064080","5070580"," I was talking a close friend brought me there and I was saying to him, I was like, you know,"
"5070960","5072240"," I'm not going to say his name here in the broadcast."
"5072580","5073920"," But I was like, you know what?"
"5074320","5083020"," I was like, you treat me as your equal and allowing me in to not judge and all that kind"
"5083020","5083420"," of stuff. "
"5083680","5087000"," It was, it made my whole head made my weekend."
"5087000","5091360"," We're talking about how we weren't out cheating on our wives."
"5091860","5093440"," We weren't out doing a bunch of drugs. "
"5093940","5095380"," We weren't out getting any trouble."
"5096100","5099740"," We weren't gambling our families money away in a casino."
"5100060","5104040"," We're just hanging a couple guys was more than a couple guys, but a bunch of guys hanging out. "
"5104740","5106240"," Not causing problems."
"5107940","5112180"," Not being a burden anybody just blowing off steam on a Friday night."
"5113640","5114940"," And I felt safe. "
"5115220","5116720"," I showed up after I had something."
"5116920","5118700"," I felt safety entire time I was there."
"5120100","5123160"," As a matter of fact, I met, I met a snap dog. "
"5123620","5126520"," I don't know if you guys know he is hung out with him for a few minutes."
"5126520","5128340"," Got some pictures, met a couple other rappers."
"5129140","5130020"," It was really cool. "
"5130500","5131340"," It was really cool."
"5132600","5134060"," There was, there was like a."
"5135780","5137620"," I don't know how much is the same stream, but."
"5138200","5142620"," Yeah, that's what it was. "
"5144120","5147140"," Respectful and I was trusted and it was really cool."
"5147560","5149580"," And I got to say, man, it was fucking awesome."
"5149900","5153240"," Like, if you're an African American, you get to live around African Americans. "
"5153880","5156900"," You guys have some if you don't, you should hang out with more African Americans."
"5157020","5160300"," African Americans are the coolest, coolest bunch of people when you hang, especially a group of"
"5160300","5160400"," them."
"5160700","5162320"," Especially the culture wherever they live. "
"5162840","5163540"," You can hang out with them."
"5163680","5167680"," If you get a chance to do it because it's part of Americana."
"5167680","5176900"," And it's a it's a it's a culture that is rarely shown rarely shown in mass media. "
"5177160","5186220"," Like you'll see like rappers on TV or the music videos or you see a lot of portrayals of African"
"5186220","5187060"," American culture."
"5187660","5194300"," That are real, but then there's this whole other like vast huge part of African American culture"
"5194300","5196460"," that's super fucking like."
"5197080","5205060"," Fun, friendly, very familial, familial, very loyal, very like good people to each other. "
"5205220","5206520"," It's like fucking awesome."
"5207540","5210220"," What's what the aspects are not portrayed in mass media?"
"5211260","5212020"," Fascinate me."
"5216890","5221930"," I'm telling you, telling you, and you wouldn't know this that none of this stuff gets put on. "
"5222310","5226410"," None of this stuff is like they don't want like people don't want you to know this part of our"
"5226410","5227850"," country, right?"
"5227850","5229510"," And so anyways, I don't know."
"5229570","5230310"," It was really fun."
"5230550","5231270"," I had a fucking blast. "
"5231550","5233790"," I would do it again in a heartbeat."
"5237370","5239710"," Oh, yeah, well, that's the other thing too."
"5239930","5242490"," I ate my first French fries with seasoned salt. "
"5243030","5245190"," I was like, that's it's a hard attack waiting to happen."
"5245610","5246810"," But that shit tastes good."
"5246990","5250350"," Like I was like, wow, I was like these and they had just a little bit of tiny bit of"
"5250350","5251550"," seasoned salt on these fries. "
"5252070","5252970"," I'd never had them before."
"5253530","5256890"," I'd heard about them, but I finally ate them and they were fucking good."
"5256890","5260450"," I got to say it, like totally trash food, but fuck it. "
"5260590","5261950"," I think you guys are all out there."
"5262050","5264170"," You guys are all pounding mozzarella sticks out there."
"5264310","5266370"," So you ain't got nothing to say for yourself. "
"5266510","5268750"," You're all eating like fried potato skins and shit."
"5269250","5271670"," You're eating like pretzels and fucking cheese sauce."
"5273790","5275270"," You white people out there. "
"5275350","5278930"," That's all you do is feel like I'm like, this is really bad, but it does."
"5279130","5280370"," I can't say it doesn't taste good."
"5280730","5281770"," It did taste good. "
"5286110","5287790"," He got first time I've ever had him."
"5289170","5291430"," I'm a pretty white guy, man, like I'm."
"5300850","5302350"," Yeah, yeah, yeah, it was a good time. "
"5302590","5305470"," So you're watching the next bounce right now, right?"
"5305470","5308510"," So you got the first initial rip higher, whoop, right?"
"5309750","5311730"," Come on, come into this bullshit over here."
"5311830","5315210"," This ball come back down, test the one minute trigger and then rip to the upside."
"5316590","5321490"," So we should see this hold the nice little bounce going on right here on this on this one minute"
"5321490","5321710"," trigger. "
"5322350","5333390"," And this one minute trigger should support a trip higher to 429.46. Yes,"
"5333390","5338890"," that's the one thing I'm like, I know how y'all eat."
"5339630","5341910"," Not all of you, but enough of you."
"5342010","5343190"," I'm like, you guys are killing me. "
"5345990","5348510"," Fucking die of a goddamn stroke with that food."
"5349690","5351210"," But it is fucking good, man."
"5351390","5352090"," It is fucking good. "
"5354730","5355850"," I was scared."
"5356090","5356910"," I was nervous."
"5357270","5358210"," I'm going to be honest with you. "
"5358950","5363830"," This thing that I went to was not if you if you were like from the suburbs or something, you"
"5363830","5366990"," went to this thing, you'd be scared fucking shitless."
"5367330","5372550"," Like we were driving there and I heard I don't think it was associated with this event."
"5373130","5374730"," It was just the neighborhood they were in. "
"5375070","5377670"," I heard a automatic gunfire, two sets."
"5378190","5380490"," We actually pulled over and waited."
"5380950","5382690"," Then we drove up and there's a bunch of people outside. "
"5382690","5386330"," But if you just showed up outside, it was totally like Animal House."
"5386530","5387550"," I didn't belong there."
"5388350","5390370"," I needed the past to get in and stuff. "
"5391890","5394430"," And I got interrogated when I got inside."
"5395090","5400090"," They wanted to know if I was a cop, that guy had cop all that kind of stupid shit."
"5400630","5403370"," But they were open to talking and all that kind of stuff too. "
"5403910","5404910"," So we chatted and all that."
"5405510","5405850"," It was great."
"5406090","5406950"," It was fucking great though. "
"5407090","5407910"," It was fucking baller."
"5412050","5414930"," It was that a good question."
"5415050","5416230"," I should say more about this stuff. "
"5416550","5420990"," So they had a professional looking camera set up just like you go to a boxing match."
"5421450","5426970"," The ring was small and I was a little afraid of the ring."
"5428970","5430450"," It looked like a backyard. "
"5431070","5434850"," It was going to be ruthless and people were going to get fucking annihilated."
"5434850","5440790"," But they had people in place that kept their good crowd control."
"5441410","5444310"," There were moments where you're like, yeah, you got to calm the crowd down. "
"5444510","5446310"," They were successful at doing that."
"5447110","5455770"," Even though they had a really fucking ghetto ass ring, they used it to its full potential so that"
"5455770","5459390"," people weren't getting wrecked or destroyed or brawls weren't breaking out."
"5459870","5462050"," They were breaking people up like they should. "
"5462090","5464010"," They weren't letting the fights get out of control."
"5464010","5465930"," It was very well done."
"5466070","5466850"," I was very impressed. "
"5467310","5468970"," You couldn't have asked for better."
"5469270","5478750"," It was inside of an old building that was known at one time as the Muulan Rouge."
"5479830","5482970"," From the outside, the building looked like shit. "
"5483170","5484870"," But on the inside, they had great steel beams."
"5485550","5487550"," The construction of this building on the inside looked great."
"5490330","5494790"," It was over on West Chicago, which is not a nice place. "
"5497890","5501810"," It says that the building is unoccupied, but it wasn't what I was there."
"5502390","5503850"," It was definitely occupied."
"5505110","5507030"," It doesn't have a business in there. "
"5507950","5510030"," Supposedly, they're going to do another one in two weeks."
"5511890","5514990"," I'll try to find out they had video of this fight too."
"5515670","5517890"," They made a video in this fight. "
"5518330","5523090"," Oh, yeah, they were fighting."
"5523450","5524290"," That's the other thing."
"5524810","5525710"," They really fought. "
"5526270","5527470"," They really were fighting."
"5527930","5529890"," They kept it as clean as possible."
"5530390","5530990"," It was great. "
"5531430","5532290"," I was very impressed."
"5534070","5537170"," There was never a time where I felt like things could get out of control."
"5538130","5539710"," You could feel it in the room. "
"5540570","5547610"," You could feel that everyone was like, hey, we're doing this for good reasoning and we're doing"
"5547610","5551690"," this for good reasoning and we're not going to let any bad shit happen here."
"5551870","5553170"," That was awesome to see."
"5553990","5555490"," Now, could bad shit have happened?"
"5555830","5555910"," Sure. "
"5556650","5557870"," But bad shit can happen anywhere."
"5558150","5563930"," If you guys go out to bars, I don't care what your white, black, Puerto Rican, brown, Asian, I"
"5563930","5564230"," don't care."
"5564370","5569130"," You go to a bar at nighttime and you guys already know you stay at a bar long enough. "
"5569130","5571030"," That shit's closing with a fight, right?"
"5571810","5573510"," I remember I used to go to bars."
"5573730","5577310"," I remember you go to a bar and if you stay late enough at the wrong bar, you go to"
"5577310","5579810"," a nightclub in the city."
"5580670","5582530"," Some stupid shit always happens, right?"
"5583390","5585310"," Or eventually some stupid shit happens. "
"5589410","5590670"," Man, A's on everything."
"5591050","5591290"," Absolutely."
"5596270","5598090"," Was there a secret knock?"
"5598730","5599110"," No. "
"5601070","5609070"," But as I was walking inside, I walked by a group of people and one guy very quietly said, what"
"5609070","5609350"," up, no?"
"5609730","5612510"," And I turned to him and I go, what up, bro?"
"5612730","5613590"," I was like, what's going on?"
"5613810","5618850"," And I shook his hand and I acted dorky like a white guy and the guy was like, he stopped"
"5618850","5619930"," and said hello to me."
"5620310","5623010"," I think that was the secret handshake for the beginning."
"5624650","5625630"," And that was it. "
"5625710","5626610"," He was like, what's going on, man?"
"5626610","5627890"," I was like, nothing to start chatting."
"5629230","5630430"," And everything was fine."
"5632930","5637350"," I've been told that they do MMA style fighting at these things. "
"5637970","5642430"," The fighters that were there that night, there was no MMA fighting."
"5643130","5646450"," It was fascinating too because I got to speak to a lot of the fighters."
"5647190","5651610"," And I wanted to know who had some formal boxing training and who didn't. "
"5651610","5656750"," I was impressed at the number of people that claim they did not have any boxing experience."
"5658510","5662330"," One of my best friends is an Olympic boxer, a guy I've grown up with."
"5666470","5668570"," And he used to live next door to me. "
"5668690","5672210"," Another friend is a famed UFC fighter that lived next door to me."
"5673090","5676230"," So for about seven years, I lived next door to some professional fighters."
"5676550","5677730"," And so I'd go over and train with those guys. "
"5678270","5680810"," You can kind of tell who's a professional and who's not."
"5681110","5686730"," I was surprised at the number of people that were not classically trained as a fighter that still"
"5686730","5690250"," had the moves of a trained fighter."
"5690930","5696970"," I didn't try to push the matter, but I did ask pushing questions like, did you learn off YouTube?"
"5697450","5699830"," Did you learn off to have someone anyone?"
"5700570","5703550"," And a lot of the fighters claim they didn't, but I don't know that I believe them. "
"5703550","5710470"," It's very unnatural when you're, if you have any idea of what it is to be a boxer, it's very"
"5710470","5711610"," unnatural to be a boxer."
"5712450","5718750"," It doesn't feel, if you've ever taken boxing classes, you know that it's not anything like you"
"5718750","5720550"," think fighting is."
"5720550","5728790"," Twoies and higher now trying to trade above and trade that 429.46. But I'm assuming that a lot of"
"5728790","5736430"," them do watch YouTube videos, because you wouldn't know how to move the way that they moved the way"
"5736430","5743170"," that they moved their feet, the way that they moved their body, or they would come back down and"
"5743170","5747750"," grab some power off their back legs or then push that far in their front legs. "
"5750070","5755150"," The combinations that they used, all that kind of stuff showed me that someone had spent some time"
"5755150","5755910"," teaching some of these guys."
"5756270","5759390"," Some of them were trained classically, some were not."
"5759650","5763450"," I don't know if they picked it up fighting or whatever, or some of them may have had natural"
"5763450","5769770"," talents, but even with that natural talent, I'm assuming they got some kind of video on YouTube"
"5769770","5772490"," said you got to stand like this and you got to move like that. "
"5773130","5778630"," And this is how you learn how to do tempo and all that kind of stuff and rhythm when you're"
"5778630","5778910"," fighting."
"5779530","5783930"," If they looked good, man, these guys looked like I wouldn't want to fuck with a lot of these guys"
"5783930","5785550"," anywhere else in the street."
"5785550","5792770"," And one guy in particular, I ended up meeting, and I was told he was one of the best fighters"
"5792770","5794830"," in this group. "
"5794850","5796150"," He wasn't fighting that night."
"5797190","5800710"," He's fighting sanctioned to fight though in a couple weeks."
"5802110","5805290"," I did offer him some money. "
"5806110","5816030"," He probably shouldn't have, but he had told me that he paid 500 bucks for a license to fight in"
"5816030","5819330"," a sanctioned fight in a couple weeks, and I was like, if you need any help with that, let me"
"5819330","5819570"," know."
"5819670","5823310"," Maybe we can get like trade the trigger on your boxers or something."
"5824710","5826950"," I don't know what the cost for that would be. "
"5827170","5828290"," That's exactly what I said."
"5828370","5832410"," I don't know what the cost would be to put the trade the trigger logo on your shorts, but I"
"5832410","5833190"," think it would be cool as fuck."
"5833830","5837970"," Maybe if he gets back to me or something, you'll see trade the trigger shorts somewhere out there"
"5837970","5839610"," fighting in a sanctioned fight. "
"5841530","5842090"," That's true."
"5849770","5852410"," They had ring girl, well they had a, it was weird."
"5852550","5854510"," They had ring girls, but it was tastefully done. "
"5855070","5862690"," There was one ring girl that was, it was like one specific ring person, but they kept it tasteful."
"5863210","5865270"," They had a, there was a stripper butt pull in the bar."
"5865810","5866570"," There was nobody stripping. "
"5868670","5872010"," You could see a lot of respect all the way around here for people."
"5872330","5878410"," It wasn't like a stripper bar or anything like that or loose women everywhere, that kind of stuff."
"5878610","5883570"," It was very, I got to give it to these people like something that was unsanctioned. "
"5884490","5887090"," It looked like a sanctioned event to me."
"5887410","5888110"," I was impressed."
"5888550","5890990"," I was truly, truly impressed. "
"5892330","5897490"," Spy trying to squeeze and close a bunch of the gap to the upside right now."
"5898730","5900450"," It's thinking about it right now."
"5900550","5903010"," Can we close this gap return to the scene of the crime?"
"5905010","5906970"," Looks like it wants to do it right now. "
"5914760","5916640"," No, I'm not stepping in the ring."
"5916760","5917400"," I don't fight anymore."
"5917600","5918340"," I used to fight though. "
"5918340","5920320"," I used to, used to get in a lot of fights."
"5920740","5923620"," Used to, used to train to fight."
"5923920","5926120"," I've been in probably like real fights. "
"5928500","5930740"," Maybe over a hundred in my life."
"5931120","5933620"," Like real true, true fights, probably a hundred of them."
"5934540","5938080"," Whether that was in the army or if that was fucking around when I was a kid. "
"5938940","5943820"," And then when I grew up, I grew up somewhere where the fight was, was real, was part of life."
"5945940","5949080"," Yeah, probably a hundred fights somewhere in there."
"5949880","5957120"," Whether we were in a ring or we were training in the army or pissed somebody off at a bar"
"5957120","5961880"," in the ski town or, I don't know, that kind of stuff. "
"5963340","5965600"," Oh yeah, I used to love to fight."
"5965820","5967320"," It was like part of what you do."
"5969880","5971000"," So, but they did. "
"5971160","5971820"," They had ring girls."
"5972040","5977380"," They had one ring girl and then they had, they were a lot of women there in general."
"5977500","5978300"," There's a woman fight too. "
"5978420","5980120"," There was two women fought at this fight."
"5980680","5981720"," They were great fucking fighters."
"5982340","5983220"," I was very impressed. "
"5984160","5988680"," One looked like she was, one looked like she was just a good fighter."
"5989260","5989740"," No training."
"5990040","5991100"," Another one looked like she had training. "
"5992000","5992960"," I talked to her."
"5993020","5995760"," She said that she had not had any formal training."
"5996360","6000160"," She could easily be trained to be a professional. "
"6000660","6004940"," And I would probably, then she, I think it was a split decision on their fight."
"6005760","6011760"," But one of the two fighters, I could see her in a ring fight in any professional female."
"6012460","6013240"," She was that good. "
"6014180","6015560"," In person, at least."
"6019340","6020140"," Hundred fights."
"6020180","6022620"," Yeah, probably a hundred fights easily in the army. "
"6022620","6023560"," You fight all the time."
"6024640","6025440"," All the time."
"6025880","6026820"," Fights happen all the time. "
"6026980","6028220"," Fights happen amongst other soldiers."
"6028980","6030260"," They happen in the wrong places."
"6031300","6032140"," I was in college. "
"6032620","6034240"," College fights happen all the time."
"6034860","6036620"," My roommates in college were hockey players."
"6037340","6038980"," I don't know if you know what hockey players are like. "
"6040540","6042600"," I wasn't a hockey player, but they liked me."
"6042960","6044580"," So I lived with hockey players in college."
"6045660","6047000"," Hockey players love to fight. "
"6047280","6048740"," It's like a part of fucking what they do."
"6048820","6049420"," They get shit faced."
"6049700","6050400"," They have a party at nighttime. "
"6051280","6052460"," Or you know what they're beating each other up."
"6053820","6054900"," Bunch fights that way."
"6055140","6055840"," They're at ski towns. "
"6056320","6060040"," I don't know if you know anything about ski towns, but hang out in ski towns long enough."
"6060540","6066340"," You got like South Park did it really well, right?"
"6066500","6073080"," You got like the guys from like the rich kids want to fight the poor kids skiing and stuff like"
"6073080","6073360"," that."
"6073560","6074660"," It happens on the slopes. "
"6076080","6077160"," You're taught how to fight."
"6077300","6078120"," Then I grew up in Boston."
"6078940","6080600"," Growing up in Boston, it was very rough. "
"6082240","6084580"," People fight all the time in Boston, especially growing up."
"6084840","6088400"," Like your teenage kid boy in the city, it's very common."
"6092960","6094200"," No, I don't think I'm a tough guy. "
"6094280","6094820"," I've been beaten up."
"6095400","6096160"," I've lost fights."
"6096700","6098780"," I got beaten up big. "
"6099160","6103040"," I've been beaten up three or four times pretty badly."
"6103320","6105140"," I got beaten up once in the army."
"6106240","6109780"," I won a I was the. "
"6111440","6118200"," I was in like second place or something and the last guy had to fight was this big jacked southern"
"6118200","6120720"," big black man that beat my ass."
"6122080","6123320"," Fucked me up pretty bad."
"6123560","6125780"," He had probably had 50 pounds on me or something. "
"6126880","6128540"," And what else?"
"6128680","6129900"," I got one time I got."
"6131260","6133160"," Was in a fight once in a ski town."
"6133560","6135100"," I was shit faced. "
"6136140","6137440"," And I shouldn't have been."
"6137720","6140820"," And I got into a fight and I beat up a few guys."
"6142140","6143360"," They waited for me outside. "
"6144240","6145660"," They got me when the bar closed."
"6146300","6149080"," And they actually beat me into a knock me out."
"6149600","6150840"," Woke up in a snow bank. "
"6151360","6154240"," That's true story at like six, seven of them are sure froze to death."
"6157900","6159440"," One time I got beaten up."
"6159920","6161360"," Most of it didn't get beaten up. "
"6161480","6162860"," I used to win most of those fights."
"6167580","6168660"," That's true story though."
"6169560","6170740"," Both those two stories. "
"6171540","6176100"," Got a got caught in a bar fight once when I was a teenager."
"6179080","6182420"," And that time I thought I was going to die that that fight."
"6183620","6187260"," I actually actually put my hands inside of a man's mouth. "
"6188120","6191400"," And I told him I was going to rip his cheek off if he didn't get the fuck off me."
"6191400","6192640"," That's true story."
"6193860","6194680"," Years ago. "
"6195740","6197660"," I thought we shouldn't be fucking telling these stories."
"6198840","6199460"," I was getting trampled."
"6200160","6202500"," A guy attacked me going down the ground. "
"6202860","6205760"," And I was that I was going to die."
"6206520","6208180"," So I slipped my hands inside of his mouth."
"6208580","6210920"," Started pulling back in his cheek and whispered right in his air. "
"6211500","6213600"," Got him around the neck and said we're up here fucking cheek off."
"6213720","6214820"," Don't get the fuck off me right now."
"6215080","6215520"," It's true story. "
"6215520","6220500"," I don't fight anymore."
"6220700","6222040"," I'm not doing any of that stupid shit."
"6222520","6223160"," Too old now. "
"6223160","6223640"," I'm old man."
"6245280","6246380"," One quick second here."
"6248680","6249740"," Yeah, I was just looking up. "
"6250300","6253360"," So the guy that taught me how to fight his name is."
"6256220","6257700"," Squeezing higher down to the weekly trigger."
"6258820","6260380"," Trading 429 41. "
"6261200","6263200"," Squeezing all the way up right now."
"6264420","6268080"," The guy that trained me how to fight his name is Shane heaps."
"6268340","6269300"," I'll tell you what his name is. "
"6269800","6271200"," His name is Shane heaps."
"6271920","6274460"," His Olympic boxer is from Park City Utah."
"6276860","6281960"," Squeezing up now trading the weekly trigger right now trading 429 46. "
"6282400","6283740"," Say hello to my little friend on a Monday."
"6284360","6285600"," Squeezing up higher now."
"6285760","6287160"," This is where you take the money and run. "
"6288520","6298200"," You want the help of the hourly trigger here down below to push us higher."
"6298200","6300460"," Can we squeeze higher right now?"
"6300720","6301260"," Absolutely."
"6301980","6306380"," One thing to note for today that you want to be paying attention to. "
"6306960","6308720"," Let's go to the Webull chart really quick."
"6309860","6312180"," That is that we have range expansion."
"6313380","6317580"," I should have brought this up earlier and I failed too but you should have noticed it. "
"6318780","6321400"," We have range expansion coming into play."
"6321680","6324480"," Does this always play out on the first day of range expansion?"
"6325120","6325520"," No."
"6325520","6334220"," But when we do see these range expansion events and the options market can actually see where S2"
"6334220","6335200"," and 3 are down there. "
"6335700","6340080"," But you can see that there's an expectation of outsized moves."
"6340960","6345640"," You see it down here there's S3, S2, S1, R1, R2, R3."
"6345640","6346960"," It's a 443. "
"6348680","6350740"," 23 to the upside and then 412."
"6353000","6354160"," 84 to the downside."
"6354580","6355360"," That's pretty big right?"
"6355820","6359140"," So expect range expansion is the point that I'm trying to make to you. "
"6360560","6367160"," Bulls want to be trading above this weekly trigger and take out this daily trigger to the upside."
"6368200","6373460"," So how do you get that to happen is the Bulls conundrum right and bears probably wondering that"
"6373460","6374080"," same question."
"6374080","6379580"," So I personally always love the help from the hourly trigger. "
"6380180","6389580"," So if we break above here, take out that gap up here and you need, I prefer to have the"
"6389580","6395100"," hourly trigger lend a hand to take out this R1 above."
"6395440","6403900"," So I want to see this hourly trigger or even the half an hour trigger."
"6403900","6408200"," Come up here and help out with this move up here. "
"6408900","6409260"," Okay."
"6409880","6416380"," Another thing to pay attention to is these known sellers that are here and they're likely going to"
"6416380","6418980"," want to step in somewhere over here."
"6419620","6426600"," In all likelihood, any kind of trading above, we'll get a pullback and your safe spot is usually"
"6426600","6429160"," the hourly trigger to buy. "
"6429160","6429660"," Right?"
"6429880","6434820"," Wherever that is matters, does it move higher or not?"
"6435660","6436140"," Right?"
"6436520","6442480"," And I would expect any kind of squeezing above here to be met with some pretty severe resistance"
"6442480","6446360"," until the hourly trigger can help with the move higher."
"6446660","6450940"," So this bar down here slides higher and higher and higher and higher."
"6451660","6456800"," And whatever rejection is here, we're going to find out who we have more of, more buyers or more"
"6456800","6457080"," sellers. "
"6458060","6464160"," Is there more supply here or is there more demand here?"
"6464740","6464920"," Right?"
"6465440","6469840"," Is this demand stronger than these sellers that are to the upside?"
"6470580","6473440"," So pay close attention to these sellers here."
"6473900","6481840"," It would not shock me to see it take some time for the market to move higher."
"6481840","6491240"," So you could see the squeeze higher right here, some kind of fuck you know, and need for, hold on,"
"6491320","6492140"," something's going wrong here. "
"6492660","6500110"," Some kind of need for, I don't know why this is going to do it right there."
"6501550","6510330"," Some kind of need for this hourly trigger to come up right and defend this weekly trigger to push"
"6510330","6510710"," higher."
"6511230","6517790"," So you're looking for the squeeze, pull back, hourly trigger, push us higher, possibly another"
"6517790","6520290"," retest of that weekly, maybe further down the road. "
"6521310","6525450"," You know, pretend this isn't just one day, but you are looking for that."
"6525630","6534770"," So for right now, if you're a bull, right, you could expect if you're a bull, you're kind of"
"6534770","6536890"," expecting that squeeze above here."
"6539280","6539800"," Right?"
"6540160","6545140"," But you are waiting for this hourly trigger to come up to give you the real strength that you need"
"6545140","6549100"," to attack that daily trigger in the R1 to the upside. "
"6550000","6552040"," So we'll pay close attention to it."
"6553640","6556440"," How do I express this here on this chart over here?"
"6560680","6563340"," How do I express this on this chart over here?"
"6564120","6568360"," You've got 430 to the upside right here."
"6568580","6578330"," So I'm going to"
"6578330","6578810"," draw this. "
"6579030","6582110"," This is the 430 is the rest of the gap."
"6590200","6592500"," So you've got this giant gap right here, right?"
"6592980","6594080"," We're going to draw this in."
"6594820","6596180"," We'll just put a box here for it. "
"6597460","6599000"," So right here, you've got a gap."
"6613080","6614540"," Half hour trigger is moving higher."
"6615580","6616480"," Daily trigger is moving higher. "
"6617700","6623580"," Any kind of squeeze, if it does squeeze above here, congratulations, by the way, if you took your"
"6623580","6624080"," money and ran."
"6625000","6634080"," So if you do see a squeeze up here, some kind of coming on down over here is what I'm"
"6634080","6634460"," going to expect."
"6638080","6639160"," Something like that, right?"
"6639440","6645140"," Squeeze up here, consolidates, will slight roll to the downside and the hourly will pick you back"
"6645140","6645360"," up. "
"6645540","6645980"," Does that make sense?"
"6647020","6648420"," So this hourly trigger will come up."
"6653170","6658830"," Make sense, squeeze up, come back down, find, demand, and then move higher."
"6659070","6659550"," Does that make sense?"
"6661690","6668050"," If we squeeze higher and we're just waiting on the hourly trigger to come up here, right?"
"6668650","6669730"," That would work as well. "
"6670130","6671490"," It's trade down here, squeeze higher."
"6672850","6676810"," So the one thing that you could take away if you're a buyer is what?"
"6678170","6680070"," What can you take away from this price action?"
"6680890","6682970"," So let's look at the trigger screen."
"6683390","6686830"," What can you surmise for right now?"
"6687910","6689790"," What can we surmise from this chart?"
"6691050","6696610"," That the hourly trigger is holding and that we tend to squeeze off of it, right?"
"6698950","6701170"," All right, we come back down to the hourly trigger. "
"6701410","6701730"," What happens?"
"6702490","6703690"," Boom, slam above it, right?"
"6704350","6708590"," Boom, slam above it, boom, slam above it, boom, slam above it, right?"
"6708590","6715250"," So for right now, known buyers on that green line."
"6715450","6718850"," For right now, we know this is where smart money is."
"6720950","6730930"," We also know that the orange line, we also know that this orange line right here is very"
"6730930","6731330"," emotional. "
"6732870","6736390"," It's a very emotional case where all the emotions in the market lies."
"6738370","6745150"," If you know that the weekly trigger is emotional and it's also going to be volatile, it's always"
"6745150","6746450"," going to be volatile."
"6747290","6750630"," Whether we're coming down into it or coming up into it doesn't matter. "
"6751290","6751990"," Very volatile."
"6752510","6755030"," As long as we stay above the monthly trigger, we're bullish."
"6756230","6758370"," So this is major trend down here. "
"6758770","6759270"," It's blue line."
"6760610","6762390"," So we're still above that."
"6763190","6764990"," So we're still optimistic. "
"6766450","6768130"," We know that this one is wild."
"6768750","6774490"," We know that general trend is the hourly trigger, the green one, and the daily trigger, the yellow"
"6774490","6774850"," one."
"6775310","6779830"," So right now, we know that trend is up to the upside. "
"6780150","6782910"," We know that we're trading off of the hourly trigger."
"6783670","6784830"," We know that it's holding."
"6785570","6787370"," We know that demand is there. "
"6787370","6793370"," And until we find more supply than demand, the trade is higher."
"6794210","6801490"," The places that we know that the sellers are right up here, the major sellers, major supply, right"
"6801490","6802390"," up here right now."
"6802830","6808510"," We know that once we have a meeting of these mines, of the hourly trigger and the daily trigger,"
"6809290","6812810"," then we're going to find out if we have more sellers or more buyers. "
"6812810","6820390"," And as we squeeze up into this daily trigger here, you're going to get a rejection and you're going"
"6820390","6827590"," to need help of the hourly trigger and you're going to need help of the weekly trigger to push us"
"6827590","6828210"," higher."
"6829090","6829930"," You're going to need that."
"6830230","6831790"," You're not getting up there with nothing. "
"6832590","6841230"," You need the help, bulls need the help of both of these momentum to propel price above these"
"6841230","6841990"," sellers."
"6842730","6843250"," Okay."
"6844090","6846670"," So we're watching this play out right now. "
"6846670","6849190"," Do I think we break above the daily trigger immediately?"
"6849730","6850090"," Fuck."
"6850570","6850670"," No."
"6851730","6853410"," I think we squeeze up there. "
"6854250","6854770"," Right."
"6854890","6857550"," And I think you're going to need the hourly trigger to cross that."
"6857730","6863690"," The cross of that hourly over the weekly to propel us above. "
"6864210","6865970"," And then you're going to need the weekly trigger."
"6866110","6869450"," So the initial, which let me draw us out cleaner."
"6870370","6871950"," So squeeze up, right. "
"6873210","6875010"," Have the initial squeeze up."
"6875910","6881690"," What you're going to need is the hourly trigger to cross the orange, the weekly trigger to create"
"6881690","6882370"," that squeeze."
"6883190","6884110"," Right there. "
"6884950","6885590"," Right."
"6885590","6888210"," And then it's going to pull back to the downside."
"6888810","6892710"," And you're going to need this hourly to race up. "
"6893590","6903350"," And a bump up of the weekly to catch that pullback and push us to all that bullshit back"
"6903350","6905330"," there that we need to close up and get rid of."
"6905610","6907710"," So a lot of work here for the bulls right now."
"6907790","6911270"," They still haven't still haven't done what they need to do. "
"6911430","6921010"," And the last point that I'll make here is that the bulls need to sneak out of here with price."
"6923970","6928970"," Before the daily trigger crosses down."
"6929770","6930470"," Okay. "
"6931270","6940690"," So if price is not able to escape before the daily trigger crosses below the weekly trigger, all"
"6940690","6941810"," bets are off."
"6942510","6946630"," So let me show this on a better time frame here."
"6948490","6953130"," My point to you is this is a 30 minute chart right here, right?"
"6953770","6962690"," What you do not want to see in the most dangerous part of where we are is likely a rejection"
"6962690","6964830"," here or here. "
"6964830","6965570"," It doesn't matter."
"6965750","6970290"," I'll just put it up here with some kind of a resumption of a downside move."
"6970290","6977710"," So this is the most dangerous part for bulls is in here. "
"6978210","6982330"," And I would not be caught dead long here without a hedge."
"6983050","6988270"," So you have to have a hedge on as we come in here or you just sit on your hands."
"6988950","6994190"," And the reason I say that is because of course that resumption of downside moves right we got him"
"6994190","6994470"," right here. "
"6994470","6996650"," We got one right here to the downside."
"6996810","6997590"," You got one right there."
"6997730","6998470"," You got another one. "
"6998790","7001190"," This is where they come in with like boulders, right?"
"7001390","7004810"," Like these are like the barbarians on the wall, right?"
"7005350","7007490"," And they're just hurling boulders down on you."
"7008110","7011710"," So if you squeeze up here and they step right back in, what do they do?"
"7012190","7016610"," They come in right there and they just hurl us to the downside, right?"
"7017190","7018950"," And you're totally fucked here."
"7018950","7027670"," We talked earlier about a muted bull run, right?"
"7027810","7029830"," Some kind of a muted bull run. "
"7030090","7033510"," That's a possibility, right?"
"7033850","7038190"," Or you just get the rejection immediately off that dilly trigger and start heading to the downside"
"7038190","7039670"," and start blasting down there."
"7040210","7042890"," So you're not really in the out of the woods yet here, are you?"
"7043210","7044390"," You're not out of the woods."
"7044390","7052810"," If you see the resumption of the 10-year going higher, that would possibly intersect price being up"
"7052810","7053570"," there too, right?"
"7053770","7056110"," You see the resumption of the 10-year yield going higher. "
"7057230","7063410"," And as a matter of fact, the 10-year yield is bottoming down at that 4.50, 4.60, and"
"7063410","7066750"," they come right back in and start blasting us down on the equity market."
"7067090","7070150"," So the danger zone in here."
"7070250","7073210"," So what does a bull want to see in here is the next question. "
"7073210","7081630"," They want to see price break above, right?"
"7082270","7084440"," Get reversed, right?"
"7085190","7086090"," You're going to expect that."
"7087190","7090370"," And hold, that's the difference."
"7091570","7091890"," Okay?"
"7092710","7096530"," So you start to see that kind of action right there. "
"7101560","7102700"," You see the difference here?"
"7104320","7107880"," And this is also when we come into positive gamma."
"7108140","7110740"," We come up here, trade up here, come back down."
"7110940","7112480"," There's your confirmation right there. "
"7112720","7114100"," So let's watch that again."
"7114100","7118700"," So turn this to green here, right?"
"7119800","7121700"," And a bull wants to see not this."
"7122560","7126680"," You're going to see a lot of bulls out there going, whoo!"
"7126940","7127680"," Everything is awesome. "
"7128400","7129680"," Long the fuck out of the market."
"7130460","7132240"," And that's not what you're supposed to be doing."
"7134040","7136120"," You're supposed to be taking the money here and running. "
"7137000","7144600"," And then you're waiting to see if you catch the bounce to go higher, right?"
"7144900","7152380"," You want to see the confirmation on the daily trigger right here."
"7152900","7155460"," And you're waiting for the hourly trigger."
"7156080","7157920"," Same old hourly we've been talking about, right?"
"7157920","7163120"," You want to see the hourly trigger come up and support that daily trigger. "
"7163660","7166420"," And then you get your four, five, six trigger cluster."
"7166780","7167720"," You get the weekly underneath."
"7168120","7172940"," You get the hourly, the daily price, all that kind of stuff to the upside. "
"7173300","7176120"," So bulls not out of the woods yet."
"7177980","7180460"," Bulls don't want to get trapped in here, do they?"
"7181700","7183540"," Bears don't want to get trapped in there."
"7185220","7188980"," They want to see that break below over here, right?"
"7189640","7194460"," So if you're a seller, you're looking for some kind of rejection above. "
"7195380","7199840"," And you're also looking for a breakdown below the hourly trigger."
"7200400","7201660"," Hourly trigger, right?"
"7202360","7204500"," Talk about the hourly trigger being trend."
"7205300","7207340"," We're following it to the upside right now. "
"7207620","7210260"," If you see price break below that hourly trigger."
"7211160","7213400"," So let's say remove all this."
"7213640","7214580"," Let's say you see price. "
"7216840","7218060"," Squeeze up here, right?"
"7219920","7223280"," It gets set lower to check, right?"
"7225040","7228460"," Start blasting down here, right?"
"7233290","7235650"," You see the hourly trigger come up here, right?"
"7239590","7242550"," As a seller, you can take this trade right here."
"7243710","7247570"," But you can't get super bearish again unless you get the break."
"7249650","7252270"," You want the break of that hourly trend. "
"7253250","7258590"," And you want to use this daily and this hourly to your advantage."
"7259650","7261950"," And then you get your bloodbath down there, okay?"
"7262390","7263610"," That's where you enter short right there."
"7264430","7267230"," You can enter short for this little part right here, but don't hold it. "
"7267610","7268630"," Don't hold that short."
"7268630","7274910"," Take the money and run and then wait for this to show itself to then take the big huge move"
"7274910","7276130"," to the downside."
"7277350","7281050"," If we reject immediately off the daily trigger, it's the same story, right?"
"7284490","7287030"," Squeeze up here, right?"
"7288070","7289130"," Reverse to the downside. "
"7289730","7290290"," You say, I'll cap."
"7290530","7291090"," I'm short here."
"7291510","7292130"," I'm like, okay, cool. "
"7292250","7292450"," You're short."
"7293290","7294090"," What are you doing here?"
"7294550","7295530"," Are you just max short?"
"7295810","7297450"," Fuck no, right?"
"7297450","7299910"," You're short too right where that hourly trigger is."
"7301910","7302330"," Right?"
"7302450","7303890"," The hourly trigger sneaks up here. "
"7304850","7305270"," Right?"
"7305410","7306610"," You take the money right in here."
"7306810","7307250"," Does it make sense?"
"7307590","7309110"," So you got a trade like from here to here."
"7309550","7310430"," You got a trade from right there. "
"7310490","7311590"," You don't get caught in this, do you?"
"7312090","7313230"," Because what can happen here, right?"
"7313510","7315310"," Bounce back up and we start running higher."
"7316230","7318950"," The hourly trigger or the daily trigger is now helping."
"7319130","7319670"," There's your bull. "
"7320050","7322930"," There's your bear trap right there."
"7324270","7325290"," So you're waiting."
"7326070","7329670"," If you're a bear, you take money and run and you're waiting for a blast down. "
"7330330","7331210"," And rejection."
"7332210","7333970"," Take your next short right there."
"7334210","7334390"," Okay?"
"7335670","7336830"," So you have to be tactful in here. "
"7336930","7338610"," All this area in here, be tactful."
"7339070","7340830"," You don't want to get caught in any of this noise in here."
"7343630","7344070"," Right?"
"7344310","7346350"," And you're going to watch this play out right now. "
"7346410","7346990"," You're going to watch."
"7348450","7350990"," You're watching this play out right now, right?"
"7350990","7352870"," That squeeze higher."
"7354890","7355470"," Right. "
"7355830","7356510"," Hold on a second here."
"7359420","7361120"," That squeeze higher, right?"
"7361460","7362160"," Squeeze up there."
"7362340","7362440"," Fail. "
"7362720","7363220"," Just below it."
"7364020","7365280"," Come back down."
"7367140","7371260"," And then looking for that hourly trigger to push you above. "
"7372040","7372140"," Right?"
"7373640","7375080"," Start to make your way up there."
"7375240","7381700"," So you want this, you want this hourly trigger and trend to help."
"7382700","7383660"," If you're a bull. "
"7384660","7389760"," You want the weekly underneath you to give you the power that you need to break above these"
"7389760","7390080"," sellers."
"7390420","7391880"," These sellers are not fucking around."
"7392040","7398000"," And they're not fucking around up here either until you get that confirmation trade with the hourly"
"7398000","7398740"," above the daily. "
"7408540","7409600"," I'll be honest with you."
"7409740","7410900"," I'll be honest with you."
"7410900","7416260"," I'll fit the narrative to any of those events to wherever price is at that time. "
"7417480","7418420"," I'll fit the narrative."
"7418980","7428320"," When you start to trade this stuff with me, the only time that this doesn't really work for me is"
"7428320","7435820"," the only time is earnings and unknown reports up good or bad doesn't matter."
"7436120","7442900"," If it's something unknown to the market on earnings, all those gets blown out the window. "
"7443720","7452120"," The other time when I notice it matters or when levels don't matter is unknown news from any other"
"7452120","7453080"," news event."
"7453460","7459080"," So as long as it's no news, I will tell you what the news means, wherever price is."
"7459440","7464680"," If it's unknown to the market, we can have erratic movements in the market, but they usually"
"7464680","7468260"," resolve themselves by Friday or Monday. "
"7470060","7475240"," So even if we're going to have continuation of the downside, that's usually a function of the"
"7475240","7478080"," options market and the positioning in the marketplace."
"7479320","7484280"," The more you know about this stuff, the less you like you want to know what these news events are."
"7484760","7486340"," You want to be aware of them happening. "
"7486500","7490020"," You want to be aware of when they're happening, what the implications of them are."
"7490620","7497380"," But you start to realize quickly how much the options market matters, how much price matters, and"
"7497380","7503260"," how the news is spun for algorithms to pick up on whether that's good or bad or how it's"
"7503260","7503740"," interpreted."
"7504960","7513020"," It's usually a function of supply and demand and not events and the options market, which is"
"7513020","7514440"," terrible to say that it's real. "
"7517200","7521660"," So what do I think about events like news events coming out this week or like the minutes and stuff"
"7521660","7522100"," like that?"
"7522600","7523660"," I don't really fucking care."
"7523660","7526700"," I care where price is when those events launch."
"7529160","7531700"," Like are we at a bottom or top or the middle?"
"7533080","7535280"," Is the news unknown or known?"
"7535940","7542600"," That matters unless there's something unknown or a stark policy shift that we don't know about. "
"7543200","7548280"," They haven't told us about the general, even the market players don't know about."
"7549080","7550140"," Then it does matter."
"7550140","7553600"," And it can do a fundamental change to price. "
"7555460","7556380"," Good question."
"7563750","7566550"," Yes, the weekly trigger is the volatility trigger in spy."
"7567470","7570470"," So I don't know if you guys will have to explain that right now. "
"7571350","7574270"," So the one in five minute triggers, right?"
"7575190","7578370"," Are your intraday trend signals?"
"7579110","7584850"," If prices above the one in five, we're going up prices below the one in five with a cross, we're"
"7584850","7585330"," going down."
"7586330","7595370"," Your weekly intraday trend is the hourly trigger and the daily trigger."
"7595570","7600110"," Those tell you the general direction of the marketplace generally like where we go in this week,"
"7600130","7601190"," next week kind of stuff. "
"7602050","7604270"," The weekly trigger is the volatility."
"7604270","7608190"," It's the emotional trigger, as you say, right?"
"7608510","7614350"," And then the weather where bullish are bearish and macro is your monthly trigger."
"7615110","7623850"," And it also expresses the weekly and monthly also express accumulation and distribution for the"
"7623850","7629050"," market at large and your favorite tickers at large. "
"7629430","7635510"," So if you've got a ticker, your favorite ticker out there, and you want to know what bottom is,"
"7636190","7642730"," you're looking for like minus 50 on the weekly and monthly triggers."
"7643570","7652750"," Sometimes every 10, 20 years, you'll see a liquidation down to the quarterly trigger, but it's very"
"7652750","7653170"," rare."
"7653670","7655990"," You're talking about like 10, 15, 20 years. "
"7658070","7664250"," But generally speaking, you'll know if prices, if prices crossing below the monthly trigger, we're"
"7664250","7666730"," starting to get really fucking bearish on something, right?"
"7667730","7674590"," If we cross below the weekly trigger, expect some really negative volatility to the downside."
"7674950","7680130"," If we're crossing up through the weekly trigger, we're starting to up through the monthly and the"
"7680130","7682690"," weekly trigger, things are starting to get bullish."
"7682690","7684490"," As a matter of fact, I got a good example of this. "
"7684850","7686810"," Someone brought it up on Friday, I believe."
"7687910","7691270"," So we're going to look at why, why right now."
"7693270","7695150"," That's a great example right now. "
"7698220","7700000"," We're going to look at why, why."
"7702040","7703300"," This is a great example."
"7704060","7707880"," So you had a, let me see if I can do this on a longer time frame chart. "
"7714530","7716290"," It's actually a great example here."
"7718090","7720750"," You had, we maxed out back up here, right?"
"7720990","7721770"," 120, 254."
"7722430","7726430"," You've got a price stretch above the monthly trigger, right?"
"7729010","7731990"," You see price coming back down, blasting through. "
"7732170","7734410"," You see the cross of the yellow through the orange, right?"
"7734610","7737170"," This is daily trigger, crossing the orange trigger."
"7737510","7739610"," What can we, what can we derive from this?"
"7739610","7742930"," This is where we are right now in Spy, right?"
"7743670","7744970"," So let's look at this here."
"7745710","7752880"," We got a cross of the daily trigger of the weekly trigger. "
"7753280","7754260"," Do you see this right here?"
"7754360","7755940"," This is where Spy is right now."
"7756840","7758420"," We don't want this, do we?"
"7759200","7763140"," When you get a cross of the daily through the weekly trigger, people get emotional."
"7764240","7767080"," They panic and we had panic selling, didn't we?"
"7767860","7771180"," The panic sold down through the monthly trigger on YY. "
"7771880","7775980"," Blasted down through the quarterly trigger and it was like raining, right?"
"7776260","7777400"," Just raining to the downside."
"7777980","7778620"," Just look at this."
"7780100","7782080"," Everything looked, looked honky-dory, right?"
"7782360","7783060"," Everything was awesome. "
"7784400","7787620"," Big squeeze, bulls come back and I'm going to buy this dip, bro."
"7787960","7789340"," We're going to go retest, let's get a double top."
"7789580","7790380"," Buck, no, we're going down. "
"7791380","7791400"," Right?"
"7791760","7793760"," Come over here and get the cross of the daily over the weekly."
"7794120","7794140"," Boom."
"7794620","7795780"," Deps of hell, right?"
"7796820","7800840"," And pull the parachute, run, get out, and we go to the depths of hell. "
"7801020","7801280"," Look at that."
"7802820","7804220"," Come back up over here."
"7804360","7806920"," Now you've got a cross of the weekly over the monthly in the quarterly. "
"7807220","7807780"," And what happens next?"
"7808600","7808880"," Bloodbath."
"7809540","7810700"," Deps of hell, right?"
"7811060","7811300"," Bloodbath."
"7812340","7814600"," Now we've got some consolidation down below. "
"7815540","7816560"," And what are we doing here?"
"7817900","7818900"," What are we doing here?"
"7819020","7821200"," We got the consolidation of the weekly in the daily."
"7821200","7822960"," We got price, the hourly."
"7823440","7825300"," It's just toiling down here, right?"
"7825900","7831320"," Coiling, toiling, gaining up some momentum down here, trying to fight to the upside. "
"7832460","7834820"," And so in the upside move, what are we looking at here?"
"7835140","7842980"," On YYY or YYY we've got price hourly daily weekly."
"7844240","7845120"," Breaking above the monthly."
"7846160","7847260"," Making an attack for the quarterly. "
"7847920","7848960"," What does that all mean here?"
"7848960","7854420"," It means that we're building up to consolidates and to begin to squeeze."
"7855100","7858200"," And take back all of the all of this stuff back here, right?"
"7858440","7859700"," Take back this fifty seven."
"7860000","7863000"," Take back this sixty and all this bullshit up here. "
"7863100","7864380"," All this nonsense up here."
"7864880","7868300"," Now do we actually get up here and trade one twenty two fifty eight?"
"7868540","7868900"," Don't know."
"7869080","7869500"," Don't care. "
"7870380","7876900"," Only thing that I know is only thing that I know is that I've got a one, two, three, four,"
"7877500","7878100"," five trigger cluster."
"7879480","7879920"," Right?"
"7880300","7886840"," Almost a six and seven trigger cluster and I have a successful, a successful trade here, right?"
"7887440","7888840"," A back test I should call it."
"7889340","7890280"," You got the squeeze up. "
"7891120","7891560"," Boom."
"7892040","7893180"," Back test didn't hold it."
"7893860","7894440"," Where are we going?"
"7895020","7895960"," Fucking up, right?"
"7896960","7898940"," If you're going to, if you're going to take a trade here. "
"7899340","7900580"," Fuck yeah, you take a trade here."
"7900880","7902240"," You put your stops underneath it."
"7902960","7903220"," Right?"
"7903660","7905540"," You got momentum on your side, head into the upside. "
"7905540","7908580"," And you're trying to trade this forty six bucks up here."
"7908960","7912120"," This is what you'd expect us to trade."
"7912840","7913100"," Right?"
"7913300","7915120"," Everything is on your side as a buyer down here. "
"7915340","7918900"," That you couldn't have a better setup than this to trade this higher."
"7919080","7919980"," Same thing on the inverse."
"7920940","7921160"," Right?"
"7921860","7923100"," So even spy right now. "
"7923100","7925300"," Let's go back to this Y Y chart up here."
"7926120","7927920"," I want you to notice this right here."
"7929160","7930280"," See that right there?"
"7930440","7931680"," That tick strike?"
"7933780","7934640"," Rejection, right?"
"7935800","7938080"," When you reject there like that, what do you do?"
"7939260","7941040"," They let you up to breathe for a little bit. "
"7941820","7944400"," Take a breath of fresh air, bulls, because guess what's going to happen?"
"7945400","7945760"," Downside."
"7946940","7948620"," And that's what's happening right now in spy."
"7949160","7950740"," So go back to spy here. "
"7953200","7955040"," And I'm going to show you a couple other things here."
"7955280","7956640"," Go back to that chart I think in a minute."
"7958460","7960140"," Same thing happening right here, right?"
"7960940","7964580"," Big setup here for bulls to get trapped for a downside move. "
"7964780","7965660"," It's the exact same setup."
"7966240","7967940"," Up here and boom to the downside."
"7968600","7969760"," Bloodbath further down. "
"7970640","7973680"," Can I tell you how scary it is for bulls right now?"
"7973900","7974680"," I mean it, right?"
"7975060","7983620"," I mean it that this is the most dangerous time for a bull in here on the market right now."
"7984640","7986480"," Most dangerous time for bulls right now."
"7987320","7992600"," So let's talk about, let me ask you guys a question inside the stream. "
"7992780","7994580"," I'd like to transition today."
"7995200","7998920"," I'm supposed to do a training class over the weekend."
"8002540","8007740"," Let me see if I can, give me a second here. "
"8007840","8012760"," Let me see if I can, maybe we can start that class today."
"8012760","8025100"," Let me see if"
"8025100","8029160"," I can, a little squeeze above the weekly trigger just then."
"8030040","8031780"," Selling into that squeeze above. "
"8032420","8034040"," See that squeeze up here?"
"8035280","8037240"," Get that squeeze and what would be the expectation here?"
"8037360","8037980"," I already told you right."
"8038240","8041840"," You squeeze above and you're looking for some kind of a pullback."
"8046260","8047380"," That's what I'm looking for. "
"8049580","8050700"," Something like that."
"8053160","8058600"," Now, if we trade above here and hold and wait for this stuff to come up to help, that's fine"
"8058600","8058880"," too."
"8061690","8064990"," But I already know where, I already know where real buyers are. "
"8065650","8066310"," They're down here."
"8067050","8068070"," This is where your real buyers are."
"8068230","8068730"," They're right down here. "
"8069770","8072550"," 4.27.90. 4.28. That's where your real buyers are."
"8072730","8073130"," Right down here."
"8080910","8084630"," Okay, so give me a second here. "
"8087030","8089270"," When will I take profit on my bull spreads?"
"8090310","8091770"," By preference, 450."
"8092950","8099750"," I was thinking about it this week and I was like, all right, let me reword that for you."
"8100150","8107550"," So if I make 30% in the next week or two, I'll likely take off the trade. "
"8108050","8110490"," 30 to 50% of the trade, I'll take off the trade."
"8112270","8116150"," There's a mechanic at play here where I won't make the second half of that money."
"8117990","8120930"," Until one of two things happen. "
"8121390","8123050"," Either we explode to the upside."
"8124410","8131730"," Like we took like 470 or something, I would get paid the full trade or time."
"8132810","8138810"," So if it hits like that 30, 50% mark, I'll take the money and run. "
"8138810","8146150"," If it depends on where we are, it depends on how long it takes for us to get there."
"8147970","8152690"," But if it happens quickly, I guess the idea here would be if I make like 30% of this"
"8152690","8158370"," trade in the beginning part of this trade, like in the next week or two, I will take the money"
"8158370","8158710"," and run."
"8159750","8162950"," If I am upside down the trade, I'll leave it on. "
"8163450","8166870"," And I've been trapped in trades that have taken me three months to print."
"8167150","8172250"," So a month and a half, three months, I've sometimes go get stuck in a trade and I have to"
"8172250","8178310"," leave the trade on until one time, I've had to leave a trade on until the last day."
"8179330","8186350"," And I usually place these trades on end of month in OPEC's because I know for a fact that they"
"8186350","8190730"," will, depending upon if we got there earlier in the quarter or not. "
"8191510","8196309"," They'll either run it up or down to print those spreads."
"8197410","8202389"," So the idea would be here is if we don't print force 50, 440 to 450 now."
"8203430","8206330"," I would expect it to print at the end of the quarter. "
"8206889","8207469"," Does that make sense?"
"8207750","8208290"," I don't think it makes sense."
"8208950","8214270"," If we print 440, 450 in the next few weeks, I've done it."
"8214430","8220709"," Yeah, we've done it. "
"8220709","8224190"," To magnet there at some point towards the end of the quarter."
"8224549","8226570"," Even if we have a bloodbath, that's what I would expect."
"8227230","8227650"," Does that guaranteed?"
"8228530","8228610"," No. "
"8229730","8230969"," But managing the trade."
"8231309","8236730"," Yeah, that's what, as a matter of fact, when I pull that trade off, I would likely leave the sold"
"8236730","8238670"," called side of the trade on."
"8238889","8244010"," So if we go up there, the bot calls, I'll turn them in, make my money, I'll leave the sold"
"8244010","8249830"," calls on and run those fucking things right to like the 28th of December or the 29th. "
"8249830","8254049"," I like 4 p.m. And I'll just let them sit in my account until that time period."
"8255170","8255750"," Good question."
"8261040","8264059"," We'll do the question probably is, but it has to be managed. "
"8264540","8265379"," That's the other side too."
"8265540","8272620"," Like if this trade turns on me, if we get like that moment where Gaza and Israel matter, I will"
"8272620","8279559"," cut the bots call side, get those, and leave the sold call side on, leave the puts, the protective"
"8279559","8281540"," puts that I have for the underlying part of the market on."
"8286020","8286740"," And what?"
"8287160","8288260"," And run it down, right?"
"8288459","8290660"," Just run this fucking market down on the depths of hell, I guess. "
"8292520","8296459"," The only thing that I don't think that I'll do because I'm hedged is I don't think that I'll cut"
"8296459","8296840"," my underlying."
"8297600","8303760"," As long as I stay hedged, as long as I buy like 3 cent fucking puts, then I'm not panicking"
"8303760","8306040"," here for the market that I own."
"8306040","8308780"," So, I'm feeling good here. "
"8309440","8311559"," I'm feeling as good as I could possibly can."
"8314299","8318520"," What, what, what."
"8319879","8325100"," With Jimmy Barry saying here, Jimmy Barry saying we're going to go to 440 by Thursday then dump. "
"8326320","8327280"," That sounds logical."
"8328299","8329700"," And that dump that happens."
"8330160","8331160"," Jimmy, I have a question for you. "
"8331160","8335480"," I see that dump coming in on the after Thursday."
"8336559","8338040"," What do you see as a low?"
"8338580","8344680"," Because the low that I'm seeing is only like 416, 416 somewhere in there."
"8345500","8347500"," But I do see that low coming in too. "
"8347959","8350440"," And I'm not concerned about it."
"8350840","8356459"," I guess my concern here that I'm why I'm asking you is, do you think it's lower than that 416?"
"8356840","8358700"," Do you think it's like 405 or do you think it's 403?"
"8359440","8361139"," Do you think it's lower than 400?"
"8361280","8363160"," Do you think the market actually rolls down?"
"8364139","8366340"," That was my question to you because I don't see that yet."
"8367799","8371200"," I guess I need to see it with the with the daily trigger. "
"8372139","8373440"," I'm not trading it yet."
"8378780","8381040"," I'm not seeing the blood, but I'm seeing it."
"8381200","8382100"," I mean, I know that it's there. "
"8382660","8385360"," I'm not positioned for it other than hedging."
"8390850","8392830"," Yeah, 410 sounds right to me, Jimmy."
"8393770","8396810"," I think I've got 413 or 416. "
"8397250","8398210"," I got it here in the chart somewhere."
"8401340","8402740"," Let me look and see where I got it at."
"8408240","8409520"," I think I got it at four. "
"8409680","8418600"," I think I got 416 and then 409.71. Below that I got 403.87. Below that I got a"
"8418600","8428610"," 39390 and then 389.38. I think the big thing here too, Jimmy,"
"8428970","8436700"," is if we start getting rejection moves down there, that's the one that you should be like, that's"
"8436700","8438680"," the one that's to be scary as fuck, right?"
"8438940","8444060"," You get the blast down after Thursday to that 400 or 410 or whatever."
"8444920","8451500"," The big key there will be do we start rejecting upside and we start moving down would be the thing"
"8451500","8452600"," you can tell we broke trend."
"8456070","8457050"," I bought 418. "
"8457610","8461010"," So I think I bought 419 or something like that."
"8461310","8466570"," Whenever we're down at 418 last week on Tuesday, I was like, yeah, I was like, we come back to"
"8466570","8467870"," that 418 or 416."
"8467990","8471990"," I feel good as we burn all that data as time passes. "
"8473010","8475230"," This only helps my position doesn't hurt it."
"8475370","8479130"," So I'm fully fine."
"8479350","8482330"," I feel I think I could I think I would take the hit at 416. "
"8486610","8487830"," But I don't know."
"8488050","8489110"," Here we move this over for you guys."
"8489770","8491310"," You can see the next part of this trade. "
"8500420","8501920"," Yeah, I see that down there."
"8502040","8504120"," Well, you know what else is fucked up too."
"8504840","8506660"," Let's look at SPX really quick. "
"8507800","8511680"," There's a couple other if you guys aren't aware of this, we'll do it now."
"8518260","8520000"," I'd lead all this stuff or no."
"8520780","8522080"," Did I delete all these drawings?"
"8523460","8524000"," Oh, shit. "
"8525080","8525560"," Oopsie."
"8526320","8528440"," Looks like I deleted all my drawings last week."
"8534760","8536700"," So let's look at SPX really quick. "
"8539420","8551370"," I had a bunch of drawings up here with previous or with the JPM caller, but this"
"8551370","8552710"," is the first one, right?"
"8554210","8555870"," You got to see this on SPX."
"8560430","8561530"," Here's the first one."
"8561810","8563450"," That one got hammered, right?"
"8564070","8565330"," We knocked that one out of the park. "
"8566910","8570150"," The next level one down is down here, though, isn't it?"
"8570330","8571210"," It's like right down here."
"8571410","8574530"," So that's 41464133."
"8575870","8578770"," There's a sneaky little one down here that nobody's seeing. "
"8579330","8586970"," That's that 408.5. I don't know why this one is disappeared right now."
"8588110","8588970"," There it is."
"8589650","8590910"," You see it right there?"
"8592190","8594550"," There's this little tiny one down here, hiding. "
"8595490","8606260"," There's a little wee, wee, wee, little wee, wee"
"8606260","8608300"," one way, way down there."
"8608460","8609640"," And then, of course, we got more below."
"8609640","8613760"," We got air gap, air gap, air gap down here, a bunch of air gaps down here. "
"8617830","8619650"," Right now bouncing off this one."
"8622280","8625520"," But if we begin to break trend here, we begin to break trend."
"8630570","8631310"," That's the thing. "
"8631410","8637530"," We begin to break trend and, you know, like all that stuff down there will get knocked out."
"8637690","8638990"," That's 39798."
"8639450","8640830"," Like, we'll take all this right here. "
"8642070","8643290"," Take all that right there."
"8648020","8651860"," We begin to get that rejection to close that gap or even that gap."
"8652780","8654860"," Come back down, knock all that stuff out. "
"8656020","8656780"," And there you go."
"8657080","8660280"," There's your one, two, and three right there, right?"
"8660560","8669440"," There goes your all your, all your bearish, Elliot wave counters out there."
"8676040","8679080"," If you count the bull count, we're done, by the way. "
"8679460","8686020"," I don't know if you know that, but if you're trading the bull counts, we are done going down."
"8687000","8688240"," If you're in the bear count, we're not."
"8688420","8689420"," But if you're in the bull count, we're done. "
"8695100","8697640"," Bears right now looking for rejection right here."
"8698020","8699520"," They are counting on that rejection."
"8709240","8714900"," Bears looking for rejection on 429.11. If they can get it to this downside move, we'll find out. "
"8715640","8720600"," If they don't get that rejection, if price does begin to turn to the upside, begin to get this"
"8720600","8724960"," right here, you can take along here usually, make sure you don't get caught in this as well."
"8725460","8727920"," It could be a small trap for bulls right here."
"8728640","8730780"," It tells you we're going high and they roll you back down. "
"8731380","8732420"," So what are you looking for?"
"8732560","8740540"," If you're a bull, you're going to be looking for price to break above the weekly trigger."
"8743950","8750830"," And for the white line to take you higher here, you'll pick up a call only on a successful retest"
"8750830","8751430"," right there."
"8751430","8753390"," So change this to white. "
"8756200","8758500"," You'll take the trade only right here."
"8758720","8761660"," So if you get the squeeze here, you'll look for the consolidation."
"8762500","8764360"," You'll look for this right here, right?"
"8764700","8768520"," Come back, new high, come back down, confirm in the white line, and we'll go higher here. "
"8769420","8770940"," So if you're a bull, that's your trade."
"8771120","8771660"," It's above here."
"8772020","8772660"," It's not right here. "
"8772900","8774560"," It's not here at any way, shape, or form."
"8774740","8775240"," It's over here."
"8776760","8777500"," Make sense?"
"8782210","8784030"," We'll pay attention to this and see. "
"8801100","8808300"," Yeah, I think that's where we were for 2020, 4220 on SPX is where I bought the call spread."
"8817400","8819200"," Yeah, I bought a Jimbi."
"8819280","8821560"," I bought a winds on Friday at the close. "
"8821580","8824440"," I bought penny puts for Wednesday."
"8825360","8831380"," I'll have to re-up again on Wednesday, but hopefully those puts are dirt cheap again."
"8832220","8835380"," By like Wednesday clothes or something like that, I'll re-up. "
"8835560","8838500"," I was thinking I might switch to the put back spread."
"8840620","8841760"," Like heading into third."
"8841960","8844420"," If we start squeezing higher, start attacking that daily trigger. "
"8845220","8850860"," Once we get into that daily trigger, put out a put back spread and hedge that downside move some"
"8850860","8851080"," more."
"8852040","8854580"," I was, let me ask you guys a question."
"8855360","8858320"," So on Friday when we're closing, I was like, yeah, we're going to roll on Monday. "
"8858860","8861860"," Did any of you guys buy puts on Friday or no?"
"8862040","8866220"," You guys are like, anyone that did buy puts was like, whoa."
"8868180","8871860"," I was so like this weekend, I was like, I'm fucking hedged."
"8872100","8875900"," I'm like, if they fucking roll this market, we have a market crash coming into Monday when it makes"
"8875900","8876920"," so much fucking money. "
"8878800","8885060"," As I was thinking on the weekend, I was like, I was like, if we fucking roll, if we wake"
"8885060","8887920"," up Monday, we crash, I'm going to be fucking rich."
"8888420","8891860"," I'll be fucking, they would have been the trade of the year for me."
"8892120","8892740"," I'll get to say that. "
"8893160","8897760"," I got to say, I didn't talk about it on stream this morning, but I'm like, man, if we fucking"
"8897760","8900280"," crash this morning, I'd be fucking rich."
"8900280","8904880"," I would be not rich, but probably make, I haven't checked there."
"8905040","8906460"," Probably be $100,000 or something. "
"8907080","8910080"," Something fucking stupid, not rich, but you know, kind of grand in a fucking weekend."
"8910440","8910540"," Fuck."
"8910640","8910740"," Yeah. "
"8911160","8912140"," Take that all day long."
"8920340","8921940"," I would have been fucking rich today."
"8922700","8923720"," That's what I was looking for. "
"8923840","8927880"," I was like, I was like, dude, if they fucking crash this market on Monday, I'm like, it'd be so"
"8927880","8928360"," fucking rich."
"8930560","8932360"," Give me four oh six or give me death."
"8937360","8938360"," A little bit rich. "
"8946110","8950390"," Dave, what are you saying?"
"8950690","8951790"," Oh, you did, you did, David?"
"8952890","8953430"," Yeah, dude."
"8953730","8958010"," That's like, I was like, over the weekend, I was like, I was like, if they crash this shit, I"
"8958010","8959450"," was like, I'm going to be fucking rich."
"8959450","8961030"," Because it's so goddamn cheap. "
"8961230","8962950"," I'm like, shit didn't cost anything."
"8963270","8963950"," I'm like, just do it."
"8964130","8965370"," Like fucking print me, baby. "
"8966990","8968770"," I was positioned for it, so."
"8973030","8975190"," I probably would have donated some money, David."
"8975950","8977630"," I probably would have donated some money with your brother. "
"8977810","8982370"," If he had said, if we'd made that money, I would have, I would have donated some money with your"
"8982370","8982610"," brother."
"8983690","8984090"," 100%."
"8984090","8985150"," I would have donated some money. "
"8988650","8990230"," I'm like, I'm never that guy, though."
"8990450","8994410"," Like, when your head's like that, you're like, this ain't fucking printin'."
"8994410","8998870"," Oh, you had 425?"
"9000370","9002370"," Oh, you did bet you banked well then, dude. "
"9002470","9003190"," You didn't fucking awesome."
"9004370","9006110"," Yeah, I had 406 puts, man."
"9006470","9007750"," I'm like, now they stay on. "
"9007930","9011830"," I'm like, these fucking things, they're crash puts."
"9011830","9016290"," They're only, it's pretty much like, throw the money away and I never expect to get it back."
"9016830","9017990"," Please just throw it away. "
"9018490","9021390"," If you wake up tomorrow and we're like down fucking 300 points."
"9022610","9023750"," Something fucking crazy."
"9031980","9035840"," You did have a Grinch smile for the part of Sunday, Mr. Talking Monkey?"
"9037480","9042080"," I wondered how many of you were like, oh, dude, we bought puts on Friday. "
"9042740","9047040"," I've been a bunch of you were like, I don't give a fuck what happens on Monday."
"9054840","9056000"," It's too fucking funny."
"9056700","9060720"," I didn't want to talk about it this morning because I'm like, I know everybody's like solemn and"
"9062060","9065140"," everybody that I knew was like, let's get some fucking hedging going. "
"9065540","9068260"," You're not going to go up that much on Friday, not going to pull back."
"9077100","9078200"," Good job, David."
"9078480","9078580"," Good. "
"9078960","9079080"," Congratulations."
"9080320","9081280"," I still have mine on."
"9081440","9082460"," I held nothing over the weekend. "
"9082460","9083360"," That was of important."
"9083700","9088740"," So like nothing like zero to eight puts about Wednesday cheapies."
"9091880","9093040"," Yeah, you're on SPX. "
"9098640","9099040"," Yeah."
"9099480","9100100"," Well, you know what?"
"9100200","9100640"," I'll be honest."
"9101960","9104360"," I'll be 100% honest with you. "
"9104780","9105860"," I'm fully honest."
"9106240","9109380"," Like the market was not positioned to get paid."
"9109600","9109880"," Not me. "
"9110440","9114040"," The market was not in position to get paid for that role."
"9115240","9119900"," If we were like over fucking if we were over bought like if we were already."
"9120800","9127160"," You know, ready to ready to start distributing our winnings. "
"9129080","9134360"," For losses, distributing losses to other bulls, we would have fucking rolled hard and heavy."
"9134520","9135000"," It would have been awesome."
"9135360","9136980"," It would have been straight fucking red bar. "
"9137860","9142480"," But we're so fucking oversold that it's like there's no more selling to do."
"9142840","9145260"," Like you got to give it a few weeks a week or so or something."
"9148840","9151760"," Yeah, I agreed to, David. "
"9152500","9155880"," My only the only reason why I'm hedging is because of the trigger, man."
"9155880","9162500"," That fucking daily trigger is like not fucking around like that should be ominous to all of us."
"9162660","9165200"," If you're a bull bear, I don't care if you're a buyer seller. "
"9166340","9167980"," Until we're over that daily trigger."
"9168420","9169200"," That's that's real."
"9169480","9171320"," Like that is not it's not to be fucked with. "
"9172080","9175960"," Like do not don't look at that and be like, yeah, we're gonna squeeze past that."
"9175980","9176800"," Like it's nobody's business."
"9176800","9179420"," Like take it as a warning, right?"
"9179660","9185700"," That's why I'm hedged. "
"9185700","9187280"," Reason to be afraid to the upside."
"9188220","9191100"," That daily trigger is is is no bueno."
"9191540","9197780"," It's a it's a it's a forward looking forward looking warning to you to not be comfortable as a"
"9197780","9197900"," bull. "
"9199840","9201620"," Yeah, dude, that panic selling."
"9203020","9204220"," I agree, David."
"9204740","9209580"," The bond market being closed was a was a good thing for the market today. "
"9212940","9216060"," Or like so David and I was up last night."
"9216220","9217620"," I stayed up last night."
"9218180","9222780"," I stayed up because the market opened and of course we're immediately down on the fucking hourly"
"9222780","9223600"," trigger on ES. "
"9224420","9226820"," Like boom, then we started trading sideways."
"9227440","9230260"," We rode that fucking we rode that fucking hourly trigger all night long."
"9230980","9232480"," And I'm like here we go. "
"9232740","9236620"," They're going to set this shit up and see what the fucking European markets do."
"9237140","9240140"," And they set it up for the morning and nothing happened again."
"9240800","9243240"," I'm like, oh, they're gonna let it go all the way to cash market. "
"9243460","9244280"," Well shit, we're going up."
"9244460","9244920"," That's the case."
"9250520","9252160"," But they set it up, didn't they?"
"9252500","9253720"," They fucking teed it right up. "
"9254440","9256500"," They fucking teed it up over last night."
"9256680","9258700"," They parked it all night long and just waited."
"9259740","9262260"," They were just waiting for Israel to fucking. "
"9262580","9263580"," That's the thing too."
"9264220","9264980"," Like, let's be honest."
"9265500","9265840"," Let's be honest. "
"9265920","9266620"," I gotta be honest with you guys."
"9266740","9267980"," You guys gotta know this, right?"
"9270020","9276060"," So you figure the mobilization is going to take three to five days."
"9278840","9280760"," There'll be some remedial training. "
"9282160","9287000"," Hold up, hold under, hold over period for troops, assigning troops."
"9287320","9288280"," That usually takes two weeks."
"9289300","9298940"," So you figure like you figure you got like you got three days and"
"9298940","9301160"," then you got like a two week period. "
"9301160","9306740"," And then I would watch the fuck out like after the next like 10."
"9307260","9311000"," How about the next next 13 sessions?"
"9312240","9315980"," You're not out of the woods as a market participant."
"9316720","9323960"," About 13 sessions should take about rep rep reparation of soldiers probably takes about three days,"
"9323960","9327480"," especially Israeli soldiers. "
"9330260","9331940"," They'll come far and wide."
"9332320","9341160"," And then you've got about two weeks of like finding out who's fit to fight, who's not fit to fight."
"9342460","9344660"," People that are ready to go to frontline units. "
"9345200","9350160"," They've got like a readiness thing like 30% readiness for units get units filled up with soldiers"
"9350160","9352000"," or soldiers airman doesn't matter."
"9352000","9353960"," Navy, whatever the fuck you got."
"9354760","9358120"," And you're going to find out if they can actually go if they're combat ready or not, right?"
"9359340","9360820"," Then you figure they put them in the units. "
"9360820","9366360"," Those units have to muster up, get their war planning, and then they're going to go to war."
"9367220","9368420"," So you got a window here."
"9370040","9371540"," You got this horrible to say. "
"9371600","9373000"," I don't want to talk about this stuff."
"9373480","9374840"," It's not, it's not tasteful."
"9376360","9379400"," He got like a three day window of danger for the markets. "
"9380000","9382080"," Two, one to three days of danger."
"9383220","9387480"," And that would be if Israel does anything really fucking wild."
"9388340","9389520"," They like commence the bombings. "
"9390680","9392740"," They start, they start softening up Gaza."
"9393200","9400280"," They go after trying to take out targets in Qatar and in Iran."
"9401060","9408500"," If they start doing that next three days, buys them some time while they form units for a ground"
"9408500","9408880"," war. "
"9410620","9414820"," And then you've got like this next, so then you'll have like a 10 day period of risk to the"
"9414820","9415040"," market."
"9415220","9420120"," So you got the initial three day risk to the market and then you've got about a 10 day period"
"9420120","9424360"," to where real, real ground operations start."
"9424360","9429960"," Not like, not like a tip of the spare type elements and stuff like that. "
"9430480","9435260"," Not the air campaign or our ocean going and bar goes and stuff like that."
"9436700","9445780"," But when you get like the masks, like the logistics of all this stuff is complicated in the"
"9445780","9446040"," background."
"9446480","9448360"," So that should take and take a minute. "
"9448360","9451320"," I think I'm being nice here saying two weeks."
"9451540","9456860"," I think two weeks is like, two weeks is like you spin everybody up as fast as you possibly can."
"9457940","9459400"," And everybody gets a weapon, right?"
"9460240","9460980"," And you're doing your thing. "
"9461520","9468420"," They could go longer, four weeks, six weeks for logistics to get in place, but they probably could"
"9468420","9469780"," turn it on faster."
"9471180","9474040"," So you got another 10 days, like 13 days."
"9474800","9477900"," So you have three days of what the fuck's going to happen. "
"9478400","9483280"," And you got like two weeks, like 10 sessions to about 30 sessions."
"9484760","9489280"," What's the next move for the idea?"
"9489980","9495140"," I used to train with the idea at one point."
"9495440","9496880"," I was with some idea soldiers. "
"9497620","9500520"," I read shit on Reddit this weekend."
"9500900","9502580"," Do not believe those people."
"9503960","9508520"," The idea will bear some bad motherfuckers. "
"9508700","9509400"," They're like top."
"9509980","9513340"," If I was like every soldier I've either met."
"9514400","9517380"," Or have heard about from other soldiers. "
"9518840","9520340"," IDF is like top four."
"9520640","9528200"," You got like Korean rock soldiers are dangerous in ruthless Australians."
"9528720","9532840"," Some of the most ruthless soldiers and then IDF like those. "
"9533280","9536940"," They're like top three top five soldiers in the world in terms of ruthlessness."
"9537580","9540580"," They're there like I wouldn't want to fuck with those guys."
"9542980","9544580"," I wouldn't want to fuck with those guys. "
"9545260","9547240"," You think Russian soldiers can be ruthless?"
"9548180","9549060"," He ain't seen shit."
"9549420","9552720"," Like those IDF man those fucking Aussies."
"9553820","9555620"," Aussies will cut your fucking tongue out. "
"9555740","9556840"," They'll cut your fucking teeth out."
"9557300","9559820"," They'll cut your fucking ears off and wear them around their fucking necks."
"9560960","9564540"," Rocks elite your fucking eat your heart out of your chest like I'm serious. "
"9567620","9573000"," I think that's where the real risk of the market becomes like how bad does Israel get."
"9573300","9574460"," I hope that they don't get bad."
"9575600","9576700"," I hope that. "
"9577020","9580660"," I hope they use this to their advantage."
"9582520","9584740"," And they sign that deal with Saudi Arabia."
"9585020","9588660"," The Arabs get behind all this shit and it's just one more. "
"9589700","9595240"," One more step towards some kind of two state system if possible."
"9600800","9602120"," They don't fuck around dude."
"9605020","9606340"," Rocks don't fuck around. "
"9607820","9610220"," They will eat your shit in the morning."
"9610620","9614240"," As an American they'll eat your shit in the morning like those guys run around in combat boots."
"9614480","9616760"," They sleep on fucking concrete and dirt floors. "
"9617920","9620340"," They sleep in the cold and the warmth they don't give a fuck."
"9620860","9621740"," They do not."
"9623840","9624820"," Don't give a fuck. "
"9625160","9626000"," They're under equipped."
"9630220","9632040"," I don't know what to say on that."
"9632740","9633880"," I've trained with those guys too. "
"9634100","9637940"," I've seen those guys stand at attention for hours at a time."
"9638120","9640220"," Not a flinch coming out of them ready to fuck shit up."
"9642920","9648000"," I don't think they're the best equipment in the world, especially rocks, but I would fight next to"
"9648000","9648720"," one any day of the week. "
"9650220","9652400"," I'd like them to take my six all day long."
"9652820","9654660"," I would trust them all day long on my six."
"9658060","9659040"," Yeah, yeah, I agreed. "
"9662180","9663640"," That's the thing about Israelis, man."
"9663760","9665120"," That's the thing, the existential threats."
"9666260","9668000"," Regardless of what you think is right or wrong. "
"9672700","9681020"," If you're an endangered society, no matter who you are, you're going to get fucked up reactions"
"9681020","9681900"," from them."
"9682220","9684040"," That's the one thing that I hope doesn't happen."
"9684720","9694200"," I hope that Israel can use this to their advantage for their goals, but I don't want to see it"
"9694200","9696520"," devolve into what it can devolve into. "
"9696520","9701660"," You know what this can devolve into some really, really heinous shit."
"9703400","9706860"," It was last time we saw really heinous shit."
"9707020","9712140"," I know you guys think you've seen heinous shit in Ukraine, but probably Darfur, like really"
"9712140","9714640"," heinous, heinous behaviors by people. "
"9716220","9722720"," Some of the fighting that went on in the mid 2000s in Africa were really, really bad."
"9723860","9725220"," That's the one thing that I'm afraid of."
"9725300","9726520"," I don't wish that on anybody. "
"9727420","9728920"," That kind of heinous stuff."
"9729100","9729880"," We haven't seen that."
"9731420","9738380"," We haven't seen that in what in Western in the West like you even kind of think of like any"
"9738380","9739080"," time that. "
"9741440","9744560"," The West has seen heinous really heinous stuff."
"9745280","9752840"," It's been a while and maybe you guys have an example of it, but that kind of heinous fighting."
"9753080","9753660"," You don't want to see it. "
"9754160","9755240"," It's fucking brutal."
"9757060","9757680"," It's so bizarre."
"9758180","9759980"," I saw our kid on Sunday night. "
"9759980","9767280"," I was on a subreddit and the people were discussing if you should watch or not watch the videos"
"9767280","9768980"," coming out of the war right now."
"9770220","9772500"," And some people are saying you shouldn't."
"9772820","9775400"," Some people are saying you should leave a record of it. "
"9777300","9779140"," I scratched my head with that shit."
"9779360","9782880"," If you want a record of any of that stuff, you can go right into World War II and see"
"9782880","9783060"," it."
"9783360","9785920"," You can see it in the Civil War in the United States. "
"9786000","9787360"," You can see it in Darfur."
"9787580","9788120"," You can see it."
"9788900","9794600"," Examples of humans becoming monsters and animals. "
"9795620","9797100"," We have so many examples of it."
"9797520","9800500"," For some reason, young people, this is generational, right?"
"9801100","9802920"," They need to have their own examples of it."
"9803180","9803980"," That's gross to say. "
"9803980","9807600"," I don't know that you do really need to see that shit ever again."
"9808320","9810660"," Every time that it pops, it's ugly head up."
"9810820","9812180"," It makes me want to..."
"9812180","9813880"," My stomach's hurting right now thinking about it. "
"9814760","9815880"," Especially on that scale."
"9818160","9819200"," Everyone's recording it."
"9822560","9824340"," And how people become animals. "
"9825180","9830400"," When you see people become animals, a human being become an animal, then it's so fucked up."
"9838980","9841760"," Yeah, David Samund saying next week is distribution."
"9846520","9849080"," Yeah, I don't know how to comment on..."
"9850260","9853680"," I don't know how to comment on either side in this. "
"9854460","9856400"," There's a lot of..."
"9857540","9859280"," There's such a minefield."
"9860420","9868180"," It's such a minefield that I'm willing to publicly take a stand on what my thoughts are."
"9869080","9870500"," I don't want to see human life. "
"9870960","9873840"," I don't like seeing any of this."
"9874140","9875080"," I don't like seeing any of it."
"9875340","9876880"," It bothers me. "
"9877760","9883080"," It does actually have an impact on what my thoughts in my head and stuff."
"9888530","9890910"," Yeah, I don't know."
"9891170","9894770"," I'm going to stay quiet here. "
"9895090","9896090"," I'm not going to say anything."
"9896090","9901030"," Because to the victors go to spoils too and some of this, right?"
"9901350","9902190"," There's a part of that."
"9905450","9906730"," There's always a part of that. "
"9906910","9909570"," I don't see Americans giving up the US of A, do they?"
"9911670","9913090"," There's still kinds of finger pointing."
"9913890","9919050"," I was watching finger pointing over the weekend and I was like, oh, you want to speak some Native"
"9919050","9920190"," Americans about that."
"9920810","9922330"," I used to live in Santa Fe, man. "
"9922450","9924090"," You go speak to real Native..."
"9924090","9925230"," You've got Native Americans in the US."
"9925490","9927410"," They're all great and stuff, but you go to like..."
"9927930","9931010"," You go to some parts of the US and go to the wrong fucking place."
"9931770","9932990"," You ask those questions there. "
"9933850","9936190"," I think there's some reservations, man."
"9937130","9939690"," They'll make fucking East LA blush."
"9940610","9941170"," I'm serious. "
"9941750","9945770"," A lot of Americans haven't been on a reservation in the West, have they?"
"9945890","9949730"," How many Americans do you think have been on a reservation in the Southwest?"
"9950470","9950910"," Not many."
"9952150","9953210"," No, that's too many."
"9956110","9956850"," Oh, yeah. "
"9957870","9961710"," You don't see no fucking latte drinking fucking..."
"9965050","9966610"," I'm a Democrat, so..."
"9967870","9969130"," It's a hard thing."
"9969370","9970610"," Politically, it's a minefield."
"9971430","9972470"," Politically, it's a minefield. "
"9975350","9976410"," I don't know."
"9976610","9977410"," I got nothing to say here."
"9977590","9981810"," I'm not going to take sides in this because there's no winning position you can take. "
"9982510","9983310"," You can't..."
"9983310","9985050"," You're going to lose no matter what side you take."
"9986090","9989570"," And there's valid points to all the arguments presented."
"9990810","9992230"," It's a very messy, isn't it?"
"9992450","9993270"," I think it's messy. "
"9994650","9995310"," It's like..."
"9995310","9996070"," What is it like?"
"9996290","9997090"," You know what it reminds me of?"
"9997210","9998150"," It reminds me of..."
"9998150","9999370"," This is a horrible thing to say, too."
"9999530","10005230"," It's like, when I was younger, when I was a young guy, one of my best friends cheated"
"10005230","10011790"," on his..."
"10012290","10015470"," And she turned it around on me and I lost my best friend."
"10015750","10018410"," We still talk to this day, but I lost a very good friend over that. "
"10019310","10020510"," You know what I learned from that?"
"10020790","10021710"," You know what I learned from that?"
"10021970","10024510"," Don't fucking get involved in other people's shit."
"10024770","10025270"," That's what I learned."
"10026130","10028310"," Don't stick your nose in something that's not mine. "
"10031110","10032350"," You're not going to win."
"10034550","10038090"," That's why when you see domestic violence, what are police like?"
"10038090","10041510"," Police are like, they don't fucking trust either of you, right?"
"10041790","10045470"," Like, if there's like domestic violence, someone's getting arrested, right?"
"10045970","10047810"," They don't fucking trust either of you."
"10048210","10051270"," They're like, you and your boyfriend, you and your husband are fighting, you don't fucking trust"
"10051270","10051930"," either of them. "
"10052330","10053890"," They'll both turn on you, right?"
"10054130","10058250"," They'll both try to kill you in a fucking, some lonely fucking driveway somewhere."
"10059610","10060950"," Like, it's like domestic violence."
"10061170","10061690"," You don't get involved. "
"10061990","10063290"," You don't get involved in domestic violence."
"10063490","10066190"," You don't get involved in couples and their shit."
"10066190","10068110"," You leave that shit to the police. "
"10068830","10069350"," Why?"
"10069750","10072070"," Because you're not going to fucking win."
"10072730","10073850"," You're not going to fucking win."
"10075090","10077450"," They're just as likely to turn on you. "
"10077750","10078830"," They'll bite you in the fucking hand."
"10088250","10094590"," Yeah, I mean, my whole reason, it's like Ukraine."
"10094590","10096550"," So Jimmy Barry just brought up Ukraine. "
"10098590","10103870"," My whole thing with Ukraine is I know exactly what Russia's trying to do."
"10104630","10111070"," I realize that Moscow is 140 fucking miles from Ukraine."
"10112150","10118190"," I know that Russia needs that buffer, but they never do just the buffer, do they?"
"10120730","10123950"," And they didn't take part in reforms in the 90s, right?"
"10125370","10127110"," The 90s didn't take part in reforms. "
"10128170","10130030"," They got taken over by oligarchs."
"10130250","10130590"," That's known."
"10131170","10131810"," Everybody knows that. "
"10131910","10133150"," It's not an argument or anything like that."
"10134450","10138090"," So I get their positioning why they're doing what they're doing, but I don't fucking trust them."
"10138170","10140750"," And we're going to have a fucking fight, and I'm fine with that. "
"10141390","10145430"," Like, I'll be honest, as much of a Democrat as I am, I got no fucking problems."
"10145430","10148510"," I'm taking that fight with Russia or with China."
"10149310","10150410"," Personally, I don't. "
"10150730","10154310"," And if that's going to be where the fight is, I don't think that's the end of there."
"10154690","10157970"," I don't think they're building out just a buffer for Ukraine, either."
"10158810","10160970"," And they let that country break away. "
"10161750","10167610"," And as soon as Ukraine's got fraud up the ass to their most fraudulent country, they've had a hard"
"10167610","10173810"," go of trying to escape that mafia fraud."
"10175370","10180290"," All the bad shit that was in Russia, Ukraine has had to deal with that same shit."
"10181510","10182830"," And so I get all that. "
"10183170","10183650"," I get it all."
"10183850","10186470"," I get what Russia wants to do, but I don't believe that that's all they want."
"10187010","10189450"," And I don't mind standing on the corner and getting to a fight with them either. "
"10190230","10192610"," I got no problem getting to a fight with China either."
"10193150","10200070"," And if that means that there's greater US presence in the Middle East, I'm fine with that too."
"10200690","10201630"," I'm not that guy. "
"10201790","10204950"," I'm not the guy that's Russia's my enemy."
"10205470","10206510"," China's my enemy too."
"10206690","10207730"," I'm fully aware of that. "
"10208490","10213670"," And although I am peace loving and I don't ever want to see war and I don't want to see"
"10213670","10217690"," people die and all that other kind of shit, I also know where the bad guys are and what they"
"10217690","10217850"," do."
"10218010","10218370"," I've been there."
"10218470","10219390"," I live there with bad guys. "
"10219830","10223790"," And you don't ever want those bad guys on your backyard, ever."
"10224290","10226770"," You don't want them in your country, your own people doing it."
"10226770","10228970"," You don't want them ever here either. "
"10229350","10231770"," And I'm fine with US hegemony too."
"10231990","10237230"," I know that pisses people off too, but I think our hegemony is a little bit better than..."
"10237230","10243050"," I know that we're fucked up, but I think our hegemony is better than some of the countries that"
"10243050","10243690"," want that hegemony."
"10245510","10249170"," Starting to squeeze hard now, trying to retest and retrain or retrade. "
"10251910","10253730"," Retest this previous high above."
"10255630","10257010"," Put that right there."
"10257490","10258950"," There's a target to the upside. "
"10260830","10268110"," I know we were bad at so much shit out there, but do I wish we were more like a"
"10268110","10269950"," Scandinavian country?"
"10270270","10270610"," Fuck yeah."
"10271790","10273930"," But I would take who we are over."
"10274610","10276370"," I would take who we are over. "
"10277210","10278370"," I don't know if you're getting that."
"10278450","10280850"," I think that's kind of bullshit right there, but okay, whatever."
"10281750","10283730"," We'll test it out and see if it works. "
"10287710","10289310"," I prefer to be like someone."
"10289650","10290570"," I'd like peace mail."
"10290890","10293690"," As an American, we're so like..."
"10295790","10298130"," We're all fucking latte drinkers, right?"
"10298330","10300470"," I'm like, oh, I'd like to have the healthcare system from Japan. "
"10300990","10306910"," I'd like to have the social services of the Nordic countries."
"10307270","10311150"," Oh, and I'd like to have the niceness of the Canadians."
"10311690","10313930"," I'm like buffet picking here, right?"
"10314070","10315810"," I want this, and I want that, and I want this. "
"10317570","10318610"," We're ever going to be that?"
"10318850","10319230"," I don't know."
"10319610","10320970"," Do we work to be that someday?"
"10321330","10321450"," Sure."
"10323230","10324550"," We're kind of picky, right?"
"10324670","10326770"," We feel like we can go to the buffet and choose a pick and choose. "
"10327510","10329010"," It's the ego of being an American."
"10330230","10330670"," Great."
"10330870","10333630"," Like the ugly American, big, big, loud American. "
"10334950","10336390"," I want this, and I want that."
"10337090","10338390"," I don't like this over there."
"10342890","10347900"," No, no way. "
"10348340","10349020"," Right on, right on."
"10351540","10354000"," Yeah, I don't know if I'm buying this right here."
"10354940","10355320"," Maybe. "
"10355880","10360300"," I think we roll here."
"10360300","10362920"," I think there's a roll."
"10364040","10365940"," I think there's some kind of a roll down there. "
"10367860","10368600"," We'll see, though."
"10372310","10373330"," Maybe this is it."
"10373410","10376650"," Maybe this is the squeeze out to get to sneak through that daily trigger. "
"10378850","10380910"," We got to make that move at some point, right?"
"10381770","10382670"," Hold on here."
"10384290","10385190"," Time's not on our side."
"10385310","10386770"," It's kind of a perfect time to do it, isn't it?"
"10387290","10394210"," When you guys are most bearish, when you guys are most fearful, to make that move up and around. "
"10395090","10396670"," Just a little bit of gap to close above."
"10397750","10404220"," 4.30.08. So we'll leave that one back up there."
"10404580","10412420"," 4.30. That's exactly where it is. "
"10415680","10418960"," 4.30.08. Close, let's rest that gap right there."
"10419040","10419460"," Price target."
"10420440","10421380"," Right that in. "
"10421900","10424860"," Let's make it draw that in our right price target right here."
"10428160","10429700"," That's good enough right there."
"10437380","10438700"," Price target right up in there. "
"10443270","10445390"," And they're going to want to hold this up, right?"
"10447030","10448970"," So we'll do a little bit of that right there, too."
"10473800","10475100"," Yeah, I don't disagree with that, Jimmy."
"10476460","10477360"," You know what's weird?"
"10478780","10479960"," I'm going to say this. "
"10480140","10480720"," It says why Ukraine."
"10480980","10482160"," I don't mind talking about Ukraine as much."
"10482280","10482920"," I'm going to say it's why Ukraine. "
"10486660","10487020"," Russia."
"10487520","10489320"," So we have books, reports."
"10490220","10492720"," We've got this dream is sponsored by the US. "
"10492920","10494260"," When the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"10499400","10501960"," So during the collapse of the Soviet Union."
"10503280","10507300"," The US banks had people in Russia. "
"10509640","10512380"," When the US S.R. was collapsing, right?"
"10513260","10517420"," You had all of these, you had all of these nationalized companies."
"10518260","10520120"," And these nationalized companies."
"10521100","10522960"," As the government was folding. "
"10523870","10532480"," The government handed out to the citizens of US S.R. handed out stock options or stock"
"10532480","10532820"," certificates."
"10534060","10538120"," To all of all Russians to own these companies."
"10539460","10541640"," And what happened was they were worthless. "
"10543480","10545460"," And mafia in Russia."
"10546820","10551120"," Came out and paid pennies on the dollar for these stock certificates."
"10552320","10555880"," They bought these stock certificates for all these major companies. "
"10556200","10559600"," A lot of oil and gas companies in Russia specifically."
"10560900","10563460"," They bought these things for pennies on the dollar."
"10564280","10568140"," They had stacks of them rooms filled with stock certificates. "
"10570300","10577240"," And these rooms were filled with stock certificates because the mafia in Russia was buying them."
"10577980","10580480"," And they were making deals with US banks."
"10582020","10586460"," To sell these stock certificates to US investment banks. "
"10587920","10591460"," So the US actually poured a bunch of money into Russia."
"10592700","10594920"," And then the mafia got involved and started to."
"10596920","10600520"," For lack of a better word, rape these countries take all the profits. "
"10601260","10602340"," Not reinvest."
"10604940","10607740"," In infrastructure within the Soviet Union."
"10608020","10609700"," Or at that time now Russia. "
"10609980","10612100"," In time we expect comments from feds Jefferson."
"10612820","10616440"," Who gives a lunch and address titled a view from the Federal Reserve Board."
"10616900","10620080"," At National Association for Business Economics Conference in Dallas. "
"10620700","10623800"," Text is expected as well as a Q&A with moderator and audience."
"10625200","10627820"," So yeah, so the problem here is."
"10627820","10630940"," While the USSR was collapsing. "
"10632180","10638280"," The USSR also gave Ukraine offered satellite countries the ability to."
"10640040","10641660"," Become sovereign, right?"
"10642880","10646300"," And these countries took that opportunity to become sovereign."
"10646720","10647400"," And now. "
"10648220","10653700"," Along the way as these countries became sovereign, some of them were able to work on."
"10654800","10656400"," Becoming westernized."
"10657020","10659600"," Not Slav becoming westernized. "
"10660380","10664020"," To to also to reform, right?"
"10664440","10665440"," Ukraine was."
"10666180","10667840"," Able to do some reforms."
"10668760","10670700"," But still not completely escape. "
"10671820","10673460"," The trouble that."
"10674520","10676280"," Incumbrens is Russia."
"10677840","10683680"," So they were kind of forced into it to right reform Ukraine's like well we've got all the. "
"10683680","10685340"," Shit here in our own country."
"10687520","10689300"," You know, we've got all this history, right?"
"10689640","10692780"," Of our own country and our ties to Russia."
"10694100","10695360"," So it hasn't been easy for them. "
"10695400","10698260"," They're kind of enforced into that reform themselves, right?"
"10698800","10700140"," You got to choose one or the other."
"10700700","10701800"," What are you going to choose?"
"10702400","10704180"," That really didn't happen for Russia, did it?"
"10704380","10705800"," They really didn't really have to choose."
"10707100","10711760"," They weren't speak didn't just become sovereign under the thumb of somebody else. "
"10711760","10717920"," So Russia, what they chose to do is or not chose, but what happened in that power vacuum is the"
"10717920","10720540"," FSB, the old, the old school."
"10722660","10726600"," KGB and all these other internal organs and the mafia."
"10727420","10731780"," And people with money and power swooped into that power vacuum. "
"10732660","10735800"," And they didn't have to reform like other countries in the West."
"10736200","10740620"," That breeding ground took place for a decade to decades."
"10740620","10744340"," As a matter of fact, in that same time period. "
"10746200","10749460"," China signed treaties with the United States and the West."
"10750580","10754540"," The UN and all this kind of shit to to grow with us, right?"
"10755500","10757160"," Hey, we're going to we're going to join this reform."
"10758020","10759380"," And China did that too. "
"10759420","10761340"," And then they started backing out right recently."
"10761400","10763260"," They started backing out from those reforms."
"10763900","10765460"," Russia never had to do that, did they?"
"10766660","10772580"," So like I want to give Russia that I want to give Russia that I want to say to rush"
"10772580","10773840"," like on the surface. "
"10774060","10779040"," I want to be like, Hey, yeah, Ukraine should be a buffer country for Russia."
"10779040","10780880"," But let's look at let's do the brass tax."
"10781580","10782580"," Did Russia ever reform?"
"10783280","10785700"," No, is is Ukraine enough for Russia?"
"10786100","10788600"," No, never has been never will be. "
"10789620","10791220"," And they haven't reformed."
"10791660","10793360"," They haven't joined the fucking West."
"10794160","10801740"," They still believe that there that Slav fear of influence is going to and will need to be. "
"10802160","10804720"," A power in the world."
"10805520","10806140"," Right."
"10806560","10809080"," They're part of their of not allowing us edge money. "
"10809180","10811040"," So I understand that too."
"10811180","10811760"," I get it."
"10812020","10812740"," I understand it. "
"10813500","10815280"," And you know what?"
"10815420","10818180"," If they'd reformed, I wouldn't be so anti."
"10820020","10821620"," That's Slavs fair of influence."
"10821980","10823040"," I wouldn't be so anti it. "
"10823260","10828620"," I wouldn't be anti China if they were to have continued in their integration with the West."
"10829060","10832860"," So you get that world economy, you get that world which people don't like, right?"
"10833260","10834380"," Don't like that world."
"10836060","10837020"," Economy, right?"
"10837220","10840600"," There's like, there's like, there's all the conspiracy theories about it. "
"10840680","10846320"," But in truth, you've got China pulling back the past five years, 10 years."
"10847300","10853320"," From what they initially set out to do, which was become a part of this whole world economy."
"10853920","10855520"," And you've got Russia saying, fuck you. "
"10855580","10859700"," No, I don't want to be a part of that economy in that world, that world government."
"10860080","10863420"," So if that's the case in the people that are behind it."
"10864860","10869400"," Are are not for some kind of a world agreement. "
"10870360","10876880"," Then you're my enemy in my view as an American, not only my enemy, but you know, I'm not going"
"10876880","10879020"," to consider you getting Ukraine back."

"11640790","11646360"," the start of it would be right there."
"11647580","11648860"," Start of it's right there."
"11648960","11650900"," I should be more exacting in this top chart. "
"11651980","11657600"," In the second part of it would be 431-39,"
"11658020","11663620"," somewhere in there."
"11665220","11668080"," It's like a, it's like the first box is like right here."
"11671050","11674990"," And then your second box is, um, right there. "
"11677810","11678650"," There's your two boxes."
"11680530","11682190"," PT2 coming into it right now."

"11693290","11693470"," there. "
"11700540","11702220"," Trying to stay on trend to the upside."
"11722050","11726810"," Yeah, it's not a bad, not a bad, not a bad take on that career low."
"11726810","11730790"," Or what the rotation is. "
"11732290","11734850"," Does it impact what the rotation actually is?"
"11735010","11736270"," That's a good pause if I like it."
"11742910","11743810"," It's tough."
"11744110","11749790"," The one thing, if we start, if we start down the war path, I think the dollar goes to shit. "
"11750630","11751830"," Because you get government spending."
"11752810","11755570"," You get short term bond buying, not long term."
"11757650","11760190"," You end up getting more risk on behavior. "
"11761390","11767810"," If you get the government spending more money, you'll end up seeing the stock market generally go"
"11767810","11768110"," up."
"11768790","11770870"," You could see the bond market go along with it."
"11771070","11772810"," Or you could say, I shouldn't say that. "
"11773510","11774370"," Our mixing words here."
"11774750","11776310"," Like you could see like TLT go up."
"11776430","11778250"," You could see HYG go up. "
"11779270","11781590"," Due to like 20 year in the two year."
"11782610","11786430"," But like the buying of actual bonds is what you're trying to say."
"11786670","11787090"," Not the yields. "
"11787490","11788250"," Yeah, I agree with that."
"11788670","11789530"," I agree with that statement."
"11795570","11798090"," We saw 263 elk on the hill. "
"11798770","11804400"," Yeah, I agree with that too, Jimmy."
"11805020","11806980"," I don't like seeing that aspect to it too."
"11807300","11812160"," And it's, you know, Jimmy, when I was in the Army, dude, when you're in a war zone, it's nothing"
"11812160","11813760"," like what they report in the news, brother. "
"11814540","11814960"," Nothing."
"11815220","11815740"," Like zero."
"11817100","11820160"," Nothing that they report in the news during wartime is real. "
"11821600","11822340"," None of it."
"11822680","11823980"," Not a single."
"11824300","11831300"," I had a few opportunities to catch the news during wartime and they were never right. "
"11831760","11833180"," It was just selling a story."
"11833860","11835160"," The whole thing was about selling a story."
"11837040","11839200"," Squeezing up, trading PT2 right now. "
"11839560","11844980"," We got a target of 430, 91, and 431, 39 somewhere in here."
"11846860","11848760"," Big, big room over here."
"11848860","11851540"," I'm going to move this over right now so you can see the squeeze to the upside. "
"11855150","11857090"," Big squeezing right now, right?"
"11857370","11861470"," Seeing the offset at the end of the day on those hedging flows that we talked about earlier this"
"11861470","11861890"," morning."
"11863430","11864110"," Squeezing up."

"11867550","11872450"," I'm going to show the chart down below for you one more time just so you can see it."
"11873550","11875690"," So just down inside of here."
"11878330","11881950"," Two to a five minute chart here indexes regain some lost ground. "
"11881950","11889630"," S&P 500 and Dow both up about 0.3%. And as that cries is 0.1%. Just getting off"
"11889630","11891410"," that one minute trade there, right?"
"11891410","11893670"," Just so you can see where we're heading, right?"
"11894330","11894790"," Come down here."
"11894930","11895170"," Bam."
"11895370","11895890"," Bought some calls. "
"11896770","11898070"," Re-checked it down here."
"11898350","11898510"," Whoop."
"11898650","11899110"," Whoop here. "
"11899750","11901610"," All kinds of fear over the weekend, right?"
"11902210","11903090"," Get your hedging on."
"11903390","11903910"," End of the day."
"11903990","11904390"," What do we do?"
"11904510","11905210"," What do we say this morning?"
"11905930","11911310"," If we're hedging, you should see some weakness from that hedging. "
"11911670","11918350"," But if these banks are putting zero-day calls not to disrupt the market, we'll squeeze into the end"
"11918350","11918770"," of the day."

"11944990","11946850"," So are you trying to buy this?"
"11947090","11949550"," No, you're trying to take the money and run, right?"
"11950390","11957210"," Come back in and look for another trade higher or some kind of a rip higher here. "
"11958070","11960590"," Then consolidate to take this higher, right?"
"11960810","11967170"," You got this target above or now above the weekly trigger the first time."
"11967170","11972930"," In some time, you're now looking for the squeeze above the daily trigger."
"11973690","11977830"," Even if we consolidate back down to grab this right here. "

"11998910","12001790"," There's PT3 to the upside right there. "
"12002190","12003170"," Can we get it today?"
"12004350","12005370"," Big question."

"12008090","12010190"," We're breaking above it right now, right?"
"12011070","12012570"," So we're above the weekly trigger."
"12013110","12019410"," We want to see if we can hold above this PT2 and then begin to attack PT3 to the upside. "
"12019410","12023250"," And we are squeezing balls off right now."
"12023950","12029190"," Trading 4.31.29 up here trying to get to the top part of this key."

"12104970","12106970"," So if the US government starts to spend money. "
"12115170","12118870"," Yeah, what they do is they put hedges on and they try not to disrupt the market."
"12119110","12123510"," So they'll put a bunch of zero or eight calls and then as they expire, the market will go higher."
"12124130","12125730"," And they'll make money at the end of the day. "
"12130380","12131840"," And so they don't disrupt markets."
"12137250","12138670"," They don't want you to panic."

"14137640","14140440"," What do you need to get above these guys up here."
"14140440","14143980"," You need the early trigger to come up here and help you out."
"14144460","14149120"," So even if you go up here in price you need that early trigger. "
"14151280","14159020"," So we're trying to get up there right now this is a place for you to be considering trimming some"
"14159020","14161640"," of your logs as we head up that PT three."
"14163020","14164740"," What don't you get caught in."
"14165380","14167920"," You don't ever get caught in this stuff right. "
"14168580","14175550"," You let the algorithms turn that off real quick."
"14176510","14181550"," What you do up here is you let the algorithms do the work for you right you don't care because"
"14181550","14183870"," this is going to eat just as easily go to the depth of hell."
"14184510","14188370"," As we come up in here you want to let the algorithms show you the way higher right. "
"14189030","14191090"," Always let the algorithms show you the way higher."
"14193210","14196950"," And let's go over to the let's go over to the weebull chart really quick."

"14203590","14204670"," are up here. "
"14205550","14207570"," Pretty right now like we're going to squeeze up."
"14208070","14212590"," Maybe we do get the squeeze up but we could just as easily roll down and you look at this"
"14212590","14216730"," chart tomorrow and say I should have saw that coming right should have saw that coming."
"14216730","14223830"," Now saying that you still don't have to get out of your lungs or exit your lungs here. "
"14224510","14234420"," When you exit your lungs you're looking for this right here you're looking for this move here."
"14236420","14243380"," You're looking for that cross right there and you're looking for price to reverse needs to reverse."
"14247070","14249450"," Right needs to cross up and fail. "
"14251310","14253570"," Comes back up for a breath of fresh air."
"14254490","14259850"," That's your that's your chance to exit by the way and then we bloodbath down over there."
"14259850","14262090"," Okay so just right over here. "
"14263550","14268130"," You don't actually get out of your lungs until this moment right here somewhere in there."
"14268770","14272430"," And I'm not going to exit mine either just in case we get a bounce right here."
"14273530","14280370"," If we pull back and we bounce up here into the close I'm still good to go right. "
"14281450","14283510"," So I'm still long here no matter what."
"14283510","14290130"," But I do want you to not no matter what but I do want you to realize that as we"
"14290130","14290810"," get up here."
"14291990","14298310"," These sellers are not fucking around they mean business 100% they mean business. "
"14299030","14303850"," So know that they're there know that they're going to try to step in even if they get run over"
"14303850","14304910"," they're going to try to step in."
"14305050","14310470"," This is the place up here where sellers will come in to try to take over and take you back"
"14310470","14311150"," down over here."
"14311150","14312770"," Okay so just be aware of it. "
"14313210","14315750"," If you're going to exit your positions right now I understand."
"14316570","14320290"," Seems like a logical place we don't actually have to hit the daily trigger there's no requirement"
"14320290","14321250"," that we actually tag it."
"14321870","14324510"," Some of you going to stay long to see if we actually touch it. "
"14324930","14326670"," We're going to touch that PP up there or not."
"14327170","14329450"," I am staying long for that touch up there."
"14329610","14332030"," I want to see us at least go up there and slap back on the backboard. "
"14335110","14336270"," Up right there for you."

"14351550","14357050"," You want to see a price get above daily trigger and consolidate for a run higher or a rejection in"
"14357050","14358190"," a pullback to the hourly trigger."
"14359070","14361530"," The hourly trigger will send us over the daily trigger. "
"14362610","14366590"," Congratulations to if you are a bull at this point I want to give you some congratulations."
"14367610","14373390"," You have managed to break above the weekly trigger you are now testing the daily trigger."
"14374450","14381690"," My expectation here would be some kind of an attack on daily trigger a rejection or consult either"
"14381690","14389150"," a rejection until the hourly trigger can come up and test the daily trigger or we trade above the"
"14389150","14393490"," daily trigger briefly consolidates until the hourly trigger comes up. "
"14394130","14396930"," So we can proceed to head higher."

"14548120","14548660"," That was young though. "
"14548900","14549320"," That was young."
"14549760","14550060"," Stupid young."
"14550820","14552120"," I don't ever recommend anybody be in a fire. "
"14552260","14552420"," It's wrong."
"14552660","14553320"," Kill somebody fighting."
"14553640","14554100"," Don't ever do it. "
"14554560","14555440"," Don't ever be that person."
"14555920","14556800"," It's not a good person to be."
"14557700","14559020"," It does not serve you well in life. "
"14559620","14560820"," It's always better to run walk away."
"14561540","14562000"," Be the better man."
"14563500","14565420"," As an older man I regret everything I did. "
"14566420","14566960"," Huge regrets."
"14575560","14580540"," But dude she had this like when I met her she had this natural beauty."
"14581160","14582300"," She didn't need any makeup. "
"14582500","14583300"," Sometimes she put it on."
"14584660","14587140"," Put that fire engine shit on her lips and stuff."
"14587260","14588120"," She didn't look good with it. "
"14588680","14589520"," She didn't care though."
"14590120","14593600"," But when I met her dude like wake up in the morning hot still."
"14595360","14596460"," No sleep hot. "
"14599320","14600400"," No makeup hot."
"14605920","14607700"," Oh yeah here comes the squeeze."
"14610760","14612320"," I'm going to end up taking these calls off. "
"14612440","14613520"," I can already smell it."
"14613940","14615440"," I'm just going to exit and take the money."
"14616500","14617740"," I already know I'm early here. "
"14622370","14622810"," Yeah."
"14623290","14623930"," The true reason."
"14625230","14626370"," Well that's true reason. "
"14626370","14627410"," So when I joined the army."
"14628090","14629150"," I joined because of my dad."
"14629390","14631650"," I woke up literally woke up one day and felt like I wasn't. "
"14632050","14634470"," Like I wasn't living up to my father's expectations."
"14635050","14635390"," That's true."
"14637530","14640130"," When I when I joined the army though I didn't want to be an officer. "
"14640810","14643230"," I wanted to be a non-commissioned officer."
"14644230","14646670"," I have friends and family members that are officers."
"14646850","14648470"," They lose their command authority quickly. "
"14649470","14652150"," They end up going to like S two S three a bunch of other s shit."
"14652790","14655990"," And they lose any good any good leaders in the army."
"14656670","14660010"," They're not leaders for well no commissioned officers. "
"14660870","14664070"," Any good commissioned officer in the army they fucking take him from you."
"14664550","14666350"," Which is fucking bullshit."
"14666690","14667650"," I got to say it bullshit. "
"14668170","14670230"," So if you want to lead troops in the army."
"14671830","14675610"," As a commissioned officer like a lieutenant or a captain in the field."
"14675850","14676470"," That's not happening. "
"14678350","14679750"," Not fucking happening."
"14681910","14682630"," Which sucks."
"14685310","14688150"," And it angers a lot of commissioned officers. "
"14688450","14689530"," So I didn't want to get caught in that trap."
"14690530","14693790"," So if you if you join as an enlisted soldier you can become a sergeant."
"14694810","14697350"," And have all kinds of cool ass shit that you can do. "
"14699250","14702390"," Like being in they didn't see you in the army is the way to fucking go period."
"14703270","14704690"," And blow shit up tell people what to do."
"14705570","14706970"," And you don't lose command authority. "
"14707720","14717250"," Oh yeah baby talk about the wife being hot makes by go go up."
"14719050","14721810"," See if you can trade for thirty three fifty six."
"14722650","14724670"," For thirty three fifty six here. "
"14727890","14729090"," I'll tell you."
"14729610","14734490"," I lucked out like I did like the thing where I dated crazy for a long time."
"14735150","14736410"," Did a whole lot of crazy. "
"14737270","14738790"," Uh dated hot girls."
"14739150","14742290"," I had a phase of dating hot girls dating crazy girls."
"14742850","14743710"," You name it. "
"14744230","14745930"," Like girls that wanted your babies."
"14746390","14749010"," Like all those girls I dated all those girls stay away from those girls."
"14749130","14750050"," You're a young man out there. "
"14750970","14752350"," Don't stick your dick and crazy."
"14753130","14756190"," You guys all know about that like hot and crazy chart right."
"14756510","14759670"," I guess this applies to women as well dating men. "
"14759810","14760550"," I don't think it matters."
"14761470","14762530"," Like don't take crazy."
"14763190","14764230"," Or you can day crazy. "
"14764770","14765250"," Don't marry crazy."
"14768110","14771890"," Marry like your friend that you find attractive naturally."
"14773450","14776470"," And then look at their dad or mom and be like can I fuck that when I'm older. "
"14777870","14778710"," Didn't have said that."
"14782210","14782990"," Don't do that."
"14783450","14784030"," That's really bad. "
"14784150","14785230"," That's really bad to say that."
"14793430","14794970"," That applies to women too."
"14795290","14801270"," Like would you find your boyfriend's dad hot when you're older. "
"14804660","14809040"," If not, probably not good for you down the road."
"14812320","14813860"," No, she's not listening."
"14813860","14816700"," If she heard that, she'd probably kick me in the head. "
"14818900","14820400"," I get beaten down right now."
"14821020","14822540"," I live in a home of women."
"14823320","14824480"," I'm at the boss of anything. "
"14827980","14828640"," I'm a nobody."
"14829420","14830960"," I have no say in my life."
"14831620","14832380"," Dude, this weekend. "
"14833360","14835240"," So I was supposed to do a show on Saturday, right?"
"14836740","14839320"," I got fucking, not only did I get told no."
"14840300","14843140"," It's like I'm like, I'm going to come back from the game on Saturday morning."
"14843200","14844240"," I'm going to do a show. "
"14844760","14845700"," I got told."
"14846880","14848840"," So I didn't know I was doing a show on Saturday."
"14849740","14850400"," Start there. "
"14850460","14851140"," So that's my fault."
"14851700","14852980"," And I didn't tell my wife."
"14853180","14853720"," That's my fault. "
"14854760","14858120"," And then my wife was like, Oh, no, I'm taking the oldest daughter."

"14963720","14965020"," Can't have just the good stuff. "
"14968800","14972580"," You're going to pay for the kids and take the kids where they need to go and all the other"
"14972580","14973840"," crap that goes along with it."

"15102660","15103580"," But they check me."
"15103580","15106380"," And then I think sometimes that they want me to be that. "
"15106660","15109040"," Like, my kids, like, this is how sick kids are."

"15156100","15157040"," I'm like, it's not on the calendar."
"15159410","15159930"," I do. "
"15160070","15161170"," I'll be like, it's not on the calendar, honey."
"15162730","15165310"," But it's really not her responsibility, is it?"

"15276610","15279590"," Came in this morning, they told you, fuck you, no, we're buying still."
"15280190","15280630"," We're going up. "
"15280790","15281190"," We're not done."
"15282190","15282750"," Right?"
"15283210","15288830"," So where's the next logical place to look for the supply right here in this daily trigger?"
"15289330","15289890"," Right?"
"15290410","15293250"," This is the next known place for sellers."
"15293870","15295910"," We got above this place, didn't we?"
"15296650","15298230"," So they've been pushed back. "
"15298890","15299990"," That's bullish, right?"
"15300750","15302630"," We know they're right here though."
"15303390","15303950"," Right?"
"15304210","15306290"," So we're getting a little long in the tooth here, aren't we?"
"15306970","15314790"," We'd really like to see the hourly trigger or half hour trigger help price to get above."
"15315570","15316610"," Watch this right here. "
"15316830","15325090"," You want to see some help from the real buyers down here, the known buyers to push us up and"
"15325090","15326350"," over the daily trigger, right?"
"15327530","15331790"," You've also got the weekly trigger we're now above, right?"
"15332050","15333410"," This is the emotional trigger."
"15333410","15336410"," This is the volatility trigger that career Lowe was saying, right?"
"15336970","15339110"," Emotion based trigger right here."
"15339150","15341350"," You can't rely upon this one so much, can you?"
"15341990","15346970"," But you can rely on intraday trend off this one to push price higher. "
"15347710","15356770"," So until we get above the daily trigger with price until price gets above,"
"15357410","15361550"," until the HT gets above."
"15362190","15366550"," So we have price, hourly trigger, daily trigger, right?"
"15366770","15367190"," That one."
"15367410","15367890"," Friend crude. "
"15368050","15368450"," That one."
"15368610","15369010"," That one."
"15369750","15371150"," We're not out of the clear, are we?"
"15371210","15371570"," That's up. "
"15371810","15375010"," $3.57 for four spot to two percent."
"15375010","15376890"," We're not out of the woods, are we?"
"15377070","15382530"," If you're a bull or a buyer, so that's not prevalent or not showing itself right now, right?"
"15383130","15386590"," So if you're a bull for the rest of the week, what are you looking to do?"
"15387130","15391110"," So into Friday, Friday right here, what are you looking for?"
"15391350","15395630"," You're looking to buy any dips right here."
"15397430","15399930"," Okay, we'll make these larger so you can see them. "
"15401490","15403990"," You're looking to buy any dips down here, right?"
"15404350","15405490"," Into this Friday."
"15405790","15410190"," So any pullbacks that you see, let's look at them right there."
"15410650","15416570"," So if you get any kind of a pullback here, that's your place to buy, right?"
"15416570","15419070"," Anything down in here, you're buying all this, right?"
"15419290","15420730"," You're selling this right here. "
"15422390","15430310"," And you're not rebying until we get a book price gets above and the hourly trigger comes up to help"
"15430310","15430890"," out, right?"
"15431970","15433490"," Confirmation, move to the next leg."
"15434290","15435450"," Trade the next zone above."
"15435770","15439910"," So until that happens, until you have that proof, what are you doing here?"
"15440590","15446250"," So as we come up here, you're going to take the money and run and look for the next opportunity"
"15446250","15447410"," to go higher, right?"
"15447550","15448190"," It's normal, right?"
"15448410","15449630"," Up, down, up, down, right?"
"15449850","15450450"," Where do you want to be?"
"15451370","15453310"," Where do you want to be on this trend higher?"
"15453510","15455290"," You always want to be down here buying, right?"
"15455510","15459750"," You always want to be down here buying, down here buying, taking the money off up here. "
"15461750","15470190"," So into Friday, as long, here you go for your what to expect for the rest of the week here."
"15471870","15473210"," Today I'm worried this properly."
"15476990","15486970"," Into Friday, you are buying the hourly and half hour trigger in an attempt to break above the daily"
"15486970","15487750"," trigger. "
"15488910","15493230"," You're not getting long underneath the daily trigger."
"15493770","15502630"," You're going to be getting long on the hourly trigger or the half hour trigger or the hourly"
"15502630","15502870"," trigger."
"15502870","15508930"," You're going to be getting long above the daily trigger and some consolidation confirmation that"
"15508930","15509630"," we're heading higher. "
"15510330","15513410"," Set the trade up, execute it as soon as we start running higher."
"15514170","15519430"," It would not be out of this world to squeeze up here and immediately reverse the downside."
"15520530","15520670"," Immediately. "
"15522890","15529110"," Another thing I want to tell you here, another important part here is I never like, ever, never,"
"15529110","15533490"," ever like squeezing and immediately squeezing up."
"15535050","15542030"," So if we squeeze and squeeze and we don't do any check back to go higher, I don't ever like"
"15542030","15545090"," to see, so my point here would be it makes better."
"15547530","15550350"," I don't like squeezes up, they tend to fail. "
"15550890","15553070"," I don't like squeezes up here, they tend to fail."
"15553690","15555330"," I don't like squeezes up here and failing."
"15555330","15563670"," I always like to squeeze up confirmation, time for consolidation, and then you move higher. "
"15564090","15566010"," That's my favorite one, that's the money one."
"15566750","15567870"," This is sustainable."
"15568910","15573210"," These are not sustainable, these almost always come back. "
"15573910","15580610"," So even if we do trade up here and start squeezing like maniacs, I'll chase it, I'll chase"
"15580610","15588170"," that that is sustainable, it almost never is."
"15588470","15593230"," It almost always comes back, even if it's for a successful retest."
"15594410","15600010"," These big squeezes are unreliable is the point that I'm trying to make. "
"15600590","15606890"," My preference is always like squeeze up, consolidate down, and then bam, we move higher."
"15607790","15611670"," That's my preference, some sexy like that, always love that kind of action."
"15612230","15613850"," Now, can we chase this up?"
"15614070","15614190"," Yes. "
"15614830","15621430"," As long as price is above the one minute trigger, as long as price stays above the one minute"
"15621430","15625490"," trigger, which it is right now, you are long, and you will stay long."
"15625750","15631110"," Any kind of successful retest of the one minute trigger or the five minute trigger, you are long."
"15632210","15638470"," Squeezing higher right now, trading 4.32. 65 up to R1, trying to squeeze up to that PT3 into the"
"15638470","15639290"," end of the day right now. "
"15639430","15641310"," Look at that bounce right there."
"15641310","15643390"," Look at that bounce right now."
"15646430","15648810"," So what are my expectations, I guess you might ask. "
"15650510","15652470"," My expectation is we trade the daily trigger."
"15653450","15658110"," My expectation from there is to sit on my hands and wait and see."
"15658730","15664290"," If we break above the daily trigger and start heading higher, I'll keep long or add more longs or"
"15664290","15664570"," whatever. "
"15665110","15667950"," If we reject right there, I'm looking for a place to buy a dip."
"15667950","15672650"," If you are a seller, then you're looking for the sell down to the depths of hell."
"15673490","15677470"," I already talked to you about where those were, 4440 was one of them. "
"15677730","15679630"," 440 was another one of those."
"15681090","15687450"," In rejection on the daily trigger, you can possibly trade that down to the hourly, but I would not"
"15687450","15691570"," continue to stay short unless you break below and start rejecting the hourly trigger."
"15692030","15693970"," So if you're a seller, you know where to be. "
"15694310","15695990"," You know the daily trigger is on your side."
"15696950","15698070"," As a rejection point."
"15698910","15708870"," Otherwise, it's that 440, 444, zero for you to step in and try"
"15708870","15710450"," to sell this market to the depths of hell. "
"15717150","15719050"," Yeah, you need a base to sustain the move."
"15719170","15720730"," It's a good way to, good way to word it."
"15721490","15724130"," When we do this trading, I was going to do it this morning. "
"15724570","15725590"," I was like, I'll do it on Saturday."
"15725830","15726390"," I'll do it on Sunday."
"15726590","15727450"," Yo, wife's showing at me. "
"15727490","15728630"," I'm like, Oh, Monday will do it."
"15729330","15733810"," And then after the fucking war over the weekend, I'm like, we might not even get to that."
"15733930","15735930"," Like I got to be on point in case we do have a crash. "
"15737590","15739710"," So that we're not doing the training class today."
"15739950","15741250"," Maybe tomorrow we can."
"15742110","15746590"," If the market wants to find some consolidation where we trade sideways for a few days, I'll spend"
"15746590","15753430"," the time going through this stuff with you guys, but we have a lot to go through because we spent"
"15753430","15763110"," a lot of time on what the trap is, the consolidation versus distribution, how to get long or short"
"15763110","15763830"," and those things. "
"15764070","15768210"," We also have to talk about the triggers and the velocity, a bunch of other crap that has to get"
"15768210","15769430"," discussed in a stream."
"15769730","15775410"," So I didn't plan to have a war go start this weekend either."
"15775410","15777570"," So there's all that shit that's there with that. "
"15777970","15780370"," So we'll try to get started tomorrow if we can."
"15781290","15782910"," The training class for the triggers."
"15784050","15785470"," We'll try to run through it tomorrow. "
"15787530","15794070"," If possible, if the market takes a minute to breathe and consolidate at this next level, hopefully"
"15794070","15798530"," we can get some of that some of that sideways action for the theta gang and some of that sideways"
"15798530","15798910"," action."
"15799530","15806350"," Some of that some of that digest digesting digestion of the market will need to take."
"15807650","15810990"," We hopefully can get some of that so we can start that training this week at some point. "
"15812030","15814590"," But the thesis here would be we're going to trade that daily trigger."
"15815310","15822590"," Likely pull back and wait for have that hourly trigger in your in your defense to help bulls get"
"15822590","15823930"," higher and higher and higher and higher."
"15824630","15829870"," If you're looking for that dip by even where we are right now, it's down there in that half hour"
"15829870","15832150"," and hour trigger until we get above. "
"15833330","15835910"," Yeah, you're going to get the classes this week."
"15836270","15838550"," I think he's going to put out the videos."
"15838970","15843210"," We're going to rewrite all of those videos into written form. "
"15843210","15847310"," You guys are going to get that white paper and you're going to be able to add and subtract from"
"15847310","15848030"," that white paper."
"15848170","15857010"," If you disagree or agree with some examples and and then we'll release it with along with the tool"
"15857010","15859570"," and some other tools to the public."
"15859570","15861970"," So you guys will get full access to it. "
"15863150","15865290"," Anybody that matter facts us question right now."
"15866270","15869610"," Anybody that has access right now, are you guys happy so far with what you got?"
"15871650","15872450"," Not happy."
"15873370","15877390"," Do you have don't give suggestions here in the stream, but if you have suggestions, do you have"
"15877390","15878530"," suggestions that kind of stuff?"
"15886390","15889970"," I want to just I want to hit that red bar up there so I can take these call spreads"
"15889970","15890270"," off. "
"15897570","15898510"," Yeah, I like that."
"15898710","15899810"," I like those I like those base."
"15900010","15902130"," I like to come back and retesting. "
"15902270","15904510"," It's just making sure the buyers are still there."
"15905670","15909590"," It means a lot when you find out the buyers are moving higher means a ton."
"15909590","15911830"," It means that there's more money left to put in the bag. "
"15912930","15914290"," The bags still need filled."
"15917010","15917930"," He did said an email."
"15918010","15918430"," Good job. "
"15918650","15919750"," I haven't checked my email yet."
"15920530","15921790"," I'm not checking my email yet."
"15925680","15926460"," Right on, Will. "
"15926900","15927460"," Right on, brother."
"15931360","15932700"," I won't trade without it."
"15933380","15936180"," Joe and I were talking about it on Friday. "
"15936620","15938020"," Joe and I were talking on Friday."
"15938260","15943100"," We were like, I was like, dude, there's so much shit that I don't like don't need to have in"
"15943100","15944120"," front of me day in day out."
"15944240","15946200"," I need this fucking thing in front of me all day long. "
"15946540","15948180"," Like no matter what I need it in front of me."
"15949040","15951000"," Like that's that's a key point to this."
"15951000","15954020"," Like if you can't trade without it, it's it's good. "
"15954280","15955120"," And that's what it is for me."
"15955440","15956520"," I can't trade without it."
"15956900","15957960"," I'll never trade without it. "
"15958460","15961380"," You're going to find out some really fascinating stuff about this too."
"15961640","15966840"," Like you'll see people on Fintuit."
"15967220","15975180"," I shouldn't say this, but you'll see people on Fintuit and they'll give you whatever system they're"
"15975180","15981660"," using and they'll completely disregard hidden levels that these triggers show you. "
"15982280","15983760"," So they won't see the hourly trigger."
"15983980","15986340"," They won't see the weekly, the monthly, that kind of shit."
"15986560","15991700"," And they'll be like, we're going to crash right here and we fucking bounce so fucking hard or"
"15991700","15993440"," reject on those things. "
"15994620","15998180"," And it's maybe like 10% of the market knows those things are there."
"15998180","16002360"," Like 10% of the market knows that that's going to bounce like retailers."
"16003680","16005540"," So oftentimes they miss that shit. "
"16005840","16007400"," And that's where the edge comes in."
"16007580","16008920"," You wait till you see it's going to be fucking awesome."
"16010300","16012320"," You'll be like, why is anybody talking about that level?"
"16012460","16014000"," They're all focused on all kinds of other shit. "
"16014200","16015200"," You're like, they don't see that."
"16015560","16016080"," What you do."
"16016300","16020920"," So it's fascinating because that will give you an edge. "
"16021400","16022440"," It's pretty cool."
"16026680","16028360"," It's a combination of all the velocity together."
"16028360","16031700"," We're going to go over that in the videos, what it actually means. "
"16031900","16033220"," Because you've got to compound that stuff too."
"16034420","16035620"," And find out what it actually means."
"16035740","16036180"," We're below it. "
"16036260","16036680"," We're above it."
"16036820","16038820"," We're above certain levels and all that kind of stuff."
"16039060","16039300"," All matters. "
"16043320","16044200"," Appreciate that market squid."
"16044940","16045540"," Appreciate that brother."
"16046520","16046920"," And I apologize. "
"16047080","16048380"," It can't be here every day for you guys."
"16048540","16049780"," I want to be here every day, but it's hard."
"16050540","16052360"," The number of hours are streaming as it is brutal. "
"16053480","16055820"," So it's already like 35 to 40 hours a week."
"16055820","16056920"," We can week out."
"16057000","16059680"," And so you're talking about another 20 hours on top of that. "
"16059740","16061760"," It's like 50 hours or a week, 60 hours out of a week."
"16062440","16063800"," Just to get where you are right now."
"16064540","16065160"," I need more help. "
"16065340","16066000"," I need people to."
"16066680","16067620"," I need people that want to."
"16068180","16068880"," That's the other thing. "
"16069000","16070780"," I want to need to ask some people."
"16071360","16073240"," I need someone to help me make nighttime videos."
"16073640","16075320"," And I'd be willing to train somebody to make those videos. "
"16076220","16080380"," I need somebody to write morning briefs and nighttime briefs."
"16081340","16082640"," I would teach you how to do those too."
"16082640","16087160"," And I got pinky doing weekend stock picking videos coming up here soon. "
"16087340","16092320"," So I need two people right now and still haven't found them."
"16092640","16094440"," Not an easy thing to do, but it is easy."
"16094780","16095200"," It's easy. "
"16096280","16097240"," It's easy enough."
"16099340","16101520"," I think that's all relative, but whatever."
"16107710","16108570"," Streaming is hard. "
"16109730","16111890"," It's I never, I got a say, man."
"16112050","16114470"," I didn't know streaming was hard."
"16114910","16115770"," I thought it was easy. "
"16115770","16118910"," I had I was one of the people that was like."
"16119830","16120970"," Fuck streamers."
"16121610","16122610"," Fuck content makers. "
"16122610","16123670"," Fuck all those people."
"16125670","16127470"," I'm eating those words."
"16129190","16130450"," Eating those words. "
"16131710","16133650"," Have eaten those words a few times."
"16134970","16136570"," Now I have respect for those people."
"16137270","16137930"," A lot of respect. "
"16138630","16141350"," Here's a good example of that is."
"16142250","16143350"," Derek Kotenoy."
"16143790","16146010"," I have a lot of respect for what the work he does. "
"16146930","16149430"," And the amount of time and effort that he puts into what he does."
"16150170","16152290"," I have a lot of respect for what that guy does."
"16153510","16158070"," They had respect for him, but now I see what those guys actually do to put out the content that"
"16158070","16158370"," they do. "
"16159510","16160130"," It's a ton."

"16188320","16190280"," So what you guys don't see here?"
"16191000","16197520"," What you guys don't see here is that there's a group of about 30 or 40 of us, about 30"
"16197520","16198240"," to 40 people."
"16198820","16204400"," You only see my face, but there's a team of like 30 people. "
"16204860","16210020"," So when I get done streaming, I'm with these people outside of the stream."
"16210280","16217440"," I spend hours with them every day trying to find out what we need to do, what's missing, what's"
"16217440","16219540"," wrong, all the stuff where I fucked up, all that kind of stuff."
"16219720","16223380"," It's like, it's not just you see me on stream. "
"16223380","16224680"," It's not just me."
"16225340","16230800"," There's an entire level by level of it's not like hierarchy."
"16231340","16236840"," It's more like level of level of expertise or I'm good at this and you're good at that. "
"16237000","16238380"," And I do this and you do that."
"16238840","16240360"," I mean, you see what David AMS does."

"16330700","16333600"," If you're like, this isn't for me, I wouldn't throw you under a bus publicly. "
"16333760","16334540"," No, that shit happens."
"16334940","16335660"," We're all friends."
"16336000","16338180"," We all, and I want you to know something else. "
"16338360","16343420"," If you're ever interested in this, you'll never, ever find us trying to like scam users."
"16343600","16351100"," There's no like, uh, pump and shit stocks or running scams on, uh, discord people."
"16351340","16357780"," Like, here I'll, I'll buy a bunch of penny calls and then you tell your people in discord and then"
"16357780","16359340"," discorders go out and tell their people. "
"16359700","16362020"," Like all those like, um, pumping up scam shit."
"16362100","16362940"," We don't do any of that stuff."
"16363840","16368560"," There's no like behind the scenes, like fucking drama or any of that kind of crap. "
"16368820","16375420"," There's like no, none of that like, uh, there's no like porn pics or fucking whores or whatever."
"16375920","16380620"," I see all this stuff in public and I'm like, why the fuck these people get involved in this stuff?"
"16381320","16383160"," Like all that negative bad shit."
"16383860","16385160"," Uh, we don't do any of that stuff. "
"16385160","16388080"," So if you're interested, you'll never encounter that in our group."
"16390240","16390880"," I am."
"16391020","16391740"," I'm looking right now. "
"16391759","16392740"," I'm looking right now, brother."
"16393060","16393800"," I'm looking right now."
"16395099","16396500"," Are you not interested then?"
"16396840","16402800"," I know I know. "
"16402800","16409560"," Uh, trading 432 87 right now."
"16410640","16411880"," I gotta get ready to sell."
"16423369","16424869"," 432 87 right now. "
"16425349","16427230"," I'm trying to trade 433 56."
"16428270","16430610"," I got the daily trigger at 433 97."
"16437340","16440759"," But it's not the point was from someone's comment on chat earlier. "
"16441599","16443080"," The point is that I can't do it all."
"16443500","16445640"," Um, I don't have the time to do it all."
"16446020","16449540"," So, uh, and I don't want this to be about me either. "
"16449820","16451140"," There's a part of what we're doing."
"16451720","16455060"," Is where we, um, get ready to take some off."
"16455279","16456939"," You're a trader here an investor. "
"16457640","16460900"," This is a good milestone and post marker for you."
"16460900","16464080"," If you're going to take some off up here at this, uh, I'm going to, I'm going to probably take"
"16464080","16464759"," off half my trade."
"16465880","16468200"," Please squeeze up into this daily trigger up here. "
"16469580","16470460"," 433 97."
"16481800","16483680"," You want to watch it down below over here."
"16488270","16494110"," Uh, you know, like, uh, this is like a, uh, another whole thing. "
"16494110","16494430"," I don't want the conversation."
"16497490","16499250"," Um, I don't ever want it to be."
"16499369","16499990"," I know it sounds crazy. "
"16500410","16501930"," I don't want this to become though."
"16502130","16503610"," Like the captain Jim James thing."
"16504090","16513369"," Um, I'd really like this to transform into, um, like trade the trigger being a retail thing. "
"16513770","16514210"," Like it's yours."
"16517169","16519330"," So, uh, it's like multifold."
"16519630","16521790"," Like I don't ever like to be like, I don't want to be in the fur. "
"16521790","16523770"," I don't want to be the only guy."
"16524110","16525750"," I want you to trust these other people."
"16526110","16532490"," And I want you to believe in them and know that I trust those people and, um, involve other people"
"16532490","16532750"," in this. "
"16532910","16536669"," So, you know, it's not always going to be captain James."
"16536830","16541689"," So to have other people involved and to have them be a voice, you know, if you're an Elliott wave"
"16541689","16542270"," guy."
"16542910","16544430"," I want your input. "
"16544689","16545950"," Like, what do you think?"
"16546130","16549290"," You know, like what David, um, does, I want his input."
"16549290","16555990"," Like if you are, if you trade traditional charting, charting patterns, I want your input and people"
"16555990","16556610"," want your input."
"16556849","16557810"," People care about what you think. "
"16559550","16565430"," Uh, so if we get more of those people involved and we showcase their abilities."
"16565950","16573650"," Uh, it kind of takes, uh, takes it off me and makes us all kind of be holding to each"
"16573650","16579270"," other, right?"
"16579270","16581810"," How do we get that to become that over time and become sustainable?"
"16582630","16590550"," Is not to have that ego driven, um, for rules in charge of everything or that's your guy."
"16591810","16593470"," It is, you know, it's fucked up. "
"16593630","16594090"," We're not fucked up."
"16594230","16597410"," So this past weekend or Thursday and Friday."
"16598410","16606070"," I was, uh, looking at, uh, building our own charting service with data from. "
"16606070","16615330"," Um, like their Finis Viz, vid, or, um, polygon.io. And that should cost a lot of money."
"16615790","16622029"," And, you know, we're having to ask our, like I'm asking, talking to Joe Donut late week last week."
"16622330","16626450"," And, you know, it's like, well, what are your ambitions?"
"16627270","16630509"," And, uh, the ambitions are, are normal. "
"16630930","16634869"," They're like, uh, sustainable edge driven."
"16634869","16638210"," Um, service for retailers."
"16639230","16641630"," And, uh, keep it as free as possible. "
"16642189","16643930"," Uh, try to always have this like free path."
"16645050","16648590"," And, uh, then, um, the people that want to support what we're doing."
"16649150","16652570"," Can support it enough so that it's always there. "
"16652950","16654270"," It's self-sustaining."
"16654669","16656150"," But this is the crazy part of this."
"16656410","16661349"," Like, we're talking about this charting stuff and the data and building our own stuff for the"
"16661349","16661650"," future. "
"16662110","16666689"," And we were talking about, um, you know, if we get on that road, what's that?"
"16667009","16668590"," Uh, what is that goal?"
"16669150","16671910"," And it'd be kind of cool to become a hedge fund one day."
"16671950","16672890"," I know that sounds crazy."
"16673470","16675070"," Probably hearing this to the screen right now. "
"16675090","16676550"," And you're like, were you out of your mind?"
"16677930","16679310"," Uh, I think that'd be cool."
"16679930","16681470"," Um, I don't know if we can do that."
"16682750","16684689"," I don't know that we'll ever become that. "
"16685650","16690869"," Uh, but, you know, if we could become a hedge fund one day."
"16691509","16696990"," We get 20, 30 people, uh, that are, uh, come along the way, the ride with us."
"16697650","16700669"," We take this ride and it's next five years, 10 years, 20 years. "
"16701070","16702470"," And this does turn into something like that."
"16703090","16704570"," Uh, I'd be open to it."
"16705110","16709169"," And I'd be open to investing in it, too, so that we can, uh, become that someday. "
"16709529","16713869"," So that's not, uh, something that's like, yeah, it's in stone."
"16713910","16719169"," We're going to do that, but it does impact, uh, the work that we're doing and where we hope this"
"16719169","16719650"," work goes."
"16719650","16722630"," So how do you create a hedge fund or a brokerage?"
"16724070","16724750"," Even a brokerage. "
"16725349","16727169"," Uh, you got to build that shit right."
"16727330","16727610"," Don't you?"
"16727669","16729070"," It costs a lot of fucking money in time."
"16732650","16733790"," Likely all for not. "
"16736029","16739330"," But it'd be kind of cool to be in a building with you guys one day, like, you know, 20,"
"16739330","16739890"," 30 of you."
"16739990","16746230"," We can, uh, we'll have a brokerage or we'll have a hedge fund by retailers for retailers."
"16746550","16747130"," I think it'd be kind of cool. "
"16750460","16752040"," Right on over to new booga."
"16752520","16753860"," Yeah, I think we could do that."
"16754060","16754980"," I really do. "
"16755080","16756460"," I know it's, it's whale."
"16756779","16757740"," It's whale left field."
"16758779","16762720"," It's not something that I believe that we're going to do, but I am planning for it. "
"16762919","16767220"," So as like, as like, hey, did we build the infrastructure to become that?"
"16768119","16772779"," And if we build that infrastructure to become that, uh, I'm a happy guy."
"16773380","16774340"," Uh, I'd be happy."
"16774619","16776580"," It'd be, it'd be really cool to see like a retail driven. "
"16776580","16782220"," I think that's, I think not now, but the next 20 to 50 years."
"16783440","16788720"," Uh, you're going to see retail have way more power than they have right now."
"16789240","16793560"," Um, I think they will, but when you know that the professionals don't want that to happen. "
"16794020","16794660"," So."
"16796700","16798860"," You don't want retailers organizing."
"16799480","16804040"," You don't want no retailer organizing out there. "
"16804040","16805960"," Yeah, you know, we'll see."
"16807260","16809240"," The journey will be better than getting there."
"16809320","16810240"," I can promise that, right?"
"16810780","16815840"," I bet you won't have nearly as much fun if we had the hedge fund or the brokerage. "
"16817120","16819540"," As I will while we're doing this right now."
"16819740","16822880"," Like this part of it will be the great memories part of it."
"16823180","16826000"," Whether it fails or succeeds, it doesn't matter. "
"16826600","16828280"," It matters is that you're on that road."
"16830580","16836580"," I mean, that's right, broke, broke her edge."
"16839820","16841340"," And a lot of money. "
"16841920","16843200"," Oh, fuck ton of money."
"16844240","16845360"," Need a fuck ton."
"16845560","16847060"," I think I need somewhere between. "
"16849460","16852980"," Personally, I think I need about $25 to $50 million somewhere in there."
"16854500","16855340"," Round there."
"16856760","16858400"," $25 to $50 million, probably do it. "
"16859560","16860240"," Get started."
"16861000","16861680"," Get started."
"16867500","16870160"," What do you guys need to get more than $25 to $50 million?"
"16870340","16870940"," I think it's somewhere in there. "
"16871540","16872640"," About $25 to $50 million."
"16874340","16876660"," No, no, no, for a brokerage or a hedge fund."
"16877860","16879920"," Like a retail, retail-born hedge fund. "
"16880820","16884740"," I don't know if that can be done, but, you know, people tell you can't do it, but."
"16885440","16886200"," You can do it."
"16886360","16887240"," You can do whatever you want. "
"16892080","16894960"," Yeah, as long as I don't start the housing market."
"16897420","16901560"," I mean, if it fails, what do you do?"
"16901940","16902860"," I failed at doing this."
"16904320","16904900"," So what?"
"16906140","16906780"," I did it, right?"
"16907000","16907160"," Tried. "
"16908940","16909440"," A part of life."
"16910340","16911540"," A complete part of life."
"16917190","16918230"," I'm looking for loans to money. "
"16918490","16918670"," I wish."
"16918670","16920250"," I don't think they're going to give me any money."
"16920730","16921970"," I'm going to be like one of those hedge funds. "
"16921970","16923270"," It's like a strip mall somewhere."
"16926830","16933590"," I think the, you know, I read a, I read a climber."
"16934350","16936630"," A climber went missing on Everest. "
"16938890","16939850"," This past weekend."
"16941130","16945050"," And someone made a comment on the climber going missing and they go."
"16946270","16948150"," There's about three other missing people today. "
"16948330","16949250"," Nobody made that news."
"16950350","16953350"," And I wanted to like comment back to that person and be like."
"16954390","16958650"," If you get out of your fucking basement for five minutes and do something, maybe with somebody who"
"16958650","16960170"," read a fucking story about you. "
"16961410","16964530"," Like they're not going to write a story about you and your basement dying."
"16964930","16966350"," You got to get out there and do some shit."
"16966550","16967150"," Even if you fail. "
"16967450","16969730"," This woman, this looks like she's failing and is dead, but."
"16970510","16971290"," It's called living life."
"16972590","16973530"," It's okay to fail. "
"16974630","16975650"," It's okay to fail."
"16975750","16976250"," It's in that journey."
"16976310","16977550"," That's the bad ass shit. "
"16977790","16977990"," So."
"16980570","16982110"," Move this over a little bit here."
"16984030","16985610"," See if you can actually get up there. "
"16988980","16991060"," Resting bitch face on spoons right now."
"16998200","17000660"," See if they can hold it together here to get up there or not."
"17009000","17009920"," Yeah, tons of. "
"17009920","17015120"," I broke back hedge fund."
"17015940","17017340"," Captain Jim's broke our jobs."
"17020800","17021300"," Yeah. "
"17022080","17022740"," That's a nice."
"17023160","17023900"," It keeps me motivated."
"17024400","17024900"," I'll tell you that. "
"17025040","17026360"," It keeps me motivated to do it, but."
"17027180","17029060"," It brings up these questions, right?"
"17029260","17033140"," It's like, Oh, can I, can I embed a night frame chart with on."
"17034180","17035360"," On a website and. "
"17036520","17037820"," You know, it's, it's like."
"17038340","17039720"," Which route do you take?"
"17039720","17040840"," Do you take the easy route?"
"17041000","17041860"," Do you take the hard routes?"
"17042440","17044400"," Hard route is probably going to cost a ton of money."
"17044480","17045200"," I'm not going to make any money. "
"17046980","17048760"," High risk of losing all that money forever."
"17050120","17054160"," Or like, but if I do build it and it grows into something cool."
"17055800","17058780"," We have the infrastructure there to accommodate. "
"17060040","17060720"," That growth."
"17061240","17062920"," That's so I guess that's what it comes down to, right?"
"17063160","17065100"," Is now do you build the infrastructure now?"
"17065760","17067120"," Or do you wait to build it later?"
"17067640","17068840"," Or do you build it now?"
"17068840","17070360"," Just in case it did get good."
"17070600","17074120"," Or you could turn it into a brokerage or hedge fund or something. "
"17074640","17075380"," So I don't know."
"17075640","17076720"," I don't know what the answer is there."
"17077900","17079720"," But you only live one fucking life, right?"
"17079900","17080580"," You live one God. "
"17080780","17082000"," You live one fucking life."
"17082420","17083760"," You have one, one God in my view."
"17083900","17084660"," You got one go at this. "
"17086580","17088220"," You have one chance of life, man."
"17089060","17089740"," One time."
"17090300","17090420"," So. "
"17095830","17097470"," I'd rather fail on it than anything."
"17098790","17099990"," Watching this candle right here."
"17100130","17101150"," See if this can't keep it up. "
"17101950","17105110"," Do we get the hour of power or the sour hours?"
"17105290","17106130"," The big question here."
"17115890","17119960"," I was a."
"17121680","17123400"," I was thinking about."
"17123700","17128940"," So I was at that fight on Friday and man do you beat at that fight. "
"17130500","17135320"," I met some really smart intelligent people and at that fight and I was like."
"17136780","17138520"," It made me want to stay in Detroit."
"17139240","17142080"," Made me want to like live here for a long time. "
"17142940","17147440"," And like launch that shit launch like a hedge fund or a brokerage in the city of Detroit."
"17150980","17152900"," There was like a there was like a."
"17154440","17157120"," I was given reasons as to why Detroit is awesome."
"17158460","17162220"," Like like invest in this city for the long haul. "
"17162800","17164560"," Invest in people here for the long haul."
"17164980","17165660"," It was really good."
"17168320","17169420"," It was really good. "
"17169500","17169840"," Stoked."
"17178750","17180130"," Market's trying to make up its mind."
"17180170","17181550"," It's going to roll over here or not. "
"17186250","17190710"," Just so you know, H Y G coming into its first resistance currently."
"17191270","17194190"," I gave you a number earlier of 73 24."
"17194910","17200090"," There is a gap that needs filled at 73 33. "
"17201690","17204250"," There's another target to the upside of 73 40."
"17205930","17207930"," Dixie coming into its first."
"17210050","17210070"," Support. "
"17210790","17214170"," There's a little bit more room to run on that support on Dixie."
"17216130","17219750"," Vix coming down into its first support at 17 45."
"17220870","17224510"," Its next support is at 16 96 16 88. "
"17225710","17228750"," Those should all correspond to you on Vix and Dixie."
"17230090","17231330"," Apple grinding higher."
"17231330","17234810"," It's got a target to the upside of 180 57. "
"17235930","17239650"," Tesla has wiped out all of its crap to the downside."
"17240830","17242610"," Nasdaq resting bitch face."
"17243250","17247830"," As a target to the upside of 15 1 1 5 and then 15 2."
"17249250","17249930"," 39. "
"17250970","17252790"," Not much left to say here."
"17253770","17258090"," Other than we still have the ability to have an extension to the upside."
"17260730","17262730"," If we don't got that extension. "
"17263050","17267430"," Just look for that dip by down below in the one hour or half hour triggers."
"17267850","17269890"," If you are looking for an entry."
"17270670","17273330"," Currently those numbers sit at 428 96. "
"17274250","17276570"," They will be at 430 by tomorrow."
"17277150","17278790"," So 430 would be your dip by."
"17279230","17284330"," If you're a bull 430 magic number for a dip by. "
"17296130","17297130"," Doo doo doo doo doo."
"17300110","17302150"," Let's see if we can break through that supply up there man."
"17302310","17303350"," Let's just go up there and just say it. "
"17303450","17305010"," That's the yellow bar right there."
"17305110","17306550"," You see it just hanging out up there."
"17306830","17307170"," Look at it. "
"17307250","17307950"," It's just fucking parked."
"17312480","17313900"," That's the yellow bar right there."
"17315000","17315800"," Right there. "
"17318520","17319480"," I'll tell you what."
"17319580","17322800"," If you're looking for positive gamma."
"17324040","17324760"," Right there. "
"17327580","17329020"," That's where your positive gamma is."
"17330680","17332660"," You're so close to it right now."
"17336000","17337800"," That's where your positive gamma is right up there. "
"17342750","17344430"," Let me check the."
"17344950","17346330"," Give me one quick second here."
"17346450","17350950"," I'm going to check the gamma situation here. "
"17355760","17356940"," One quick second."
"17357240","17358080"," I want to check the gamma."
"17358600","17360900"," This is a gamma in the marketplace right now. "
"17370830","17372210"," Give me one quick second here."
"17388900","17389560"," And we will."
"17389720","17390640"," I promise we look at oil. "
"17390900","17392540"," We will look at oil here in just a minute."
"17394500","17395360"," S-P-X."
"17409250","17410210"," Give me one quick second. "
"17410450","17412610"," We'll have this up and spend in here in just a minute."
"17414170","17414510"," Okay."
"17414570","17415370"," Let's take a look and see. "
"17424280","17426140"," Gamma profile has changed in the market."
"17426840","17427440"," Let me."
"17430220","17432940"," One quick second here to go to gamma chart here. "
"17434200","17437820"," The gamma chart really quick."
"17438460","17448740"," I'm going to"
"17448740","17451020"," reset that because those numbers are all wrong."
"17451120","17452180"," Give me one quick second here. "
"17457550","17459450"," Let's check a 30 minute chart here."
"17459490","17459970"," Make sure I go."
"17474980","17476380"," No, why is this not. "
"17480200","17481260"," Well, one second here."
"17482560","17483440"," This is inaccurate."
"17487040","17490180"," There we go. "
"17490640","17491160"," This is right."
"17494660","17496360"," Here is your gamma profile."
"17503080","17506040"," Here now bullish above right here, right?"
"17508140","17511360"," Here's your gamma flip right here if you want to see it for the end of the day. "
"17511360","17514300"," Gamma flip is at 4350."
"17516180","17517560"," Here's your gamma flip."
"17518740","17522300"," You've got sellers at 4375. "
"17523480","17526020"," I put bullish above here for a reason."
"17528080","17530140"," You know your sellers are up here."
"17531820","17539320"," You know that we actually get low volatility from this point forward. "
"17539320","17542120"," It's going to allow volatility environments up here."
"17542600","17548640"," You can see right now that we are currently rejecting, but we still have not traded this gamma flip"
"17548640","17548980"," above."
"17549440","17553620"," So just be conscious of this is where your sellers want to step in is on this gamma flip. "
"17554820","17556260"," They want to step in here."
"17556820","17558580"," They want to step in right here."
"17558720","17559960"," This is where your sellers are going to step in. "
"17560420","17564820"," This band right here is where your real sellers are."
"17565940","17566980"," They're right in here."
"17568280","17573820"," You're not out of the woods yet until you're above that four, four, three, seven, five, zero. "
"17575580","17577960"," Four, three, seven, five, zero on SPX specifically."
"17579520","17585360"," I do also want you to note on this chart here that the expectation would be that you would be"
"17585360","17586380"," zone trading this."
"17588720","17589200"," Right. "
"17590160","17595400"," So if this does reject here on this gamma flip and comes down, you're going to be wanting to buy"
"17595400","17596280"," that if you're a bull."
"17597700","17601720"," That's that 4,300 that I told you about about five minutes ago."
"17601900","17606940"," I said, if you're a bull looking for a dip by 4,300 to trade. "
"17609280","17613340"," 4,375 on SPX 4,375."
"17614340","17615800"," So something like this."
"17621940","17623980"," Any of that kind of action right there. "
"17625020","17626180"," You buy that."
"17626440","17628580"," Definitely don't want to be buying below that."
"17629500","17637520"," That's trend in real support down here at 420. "
"17638360","17642700"," To be honest with you, you've got more more destruction and blood down here."
"17643360","17648120"," You got more destruction and blood right there."
"17652000","17653680"," It's that 410 right there. "
"17655940","17657180"," See, you can see it."
"17660160","17662560"," And what a bull really wants is they want to break."
"17665190","17672190"," What a bull really wants is to break above this 43, start attacking all this stuff up here. "
"17679300","17680380"," Inverse head and shoulders."
"17681240","17682020"," You can't see that."
"17682160","17682320"," Hold on. "
"17686000","17687540"," You said head and shoulders here."
"17687680","17688620"," I don't see a head and shoulders."
"17688820","17689780"," That's not a head and shoulders. "
"17691220","17696240"," If anything, you got an inverse right here and you're looking for some like that."
"17696820","17697960"," Wham to the upside."
"17699460","17705060"," If you want to look at all of what's forming, what's forming is an inverse head and shoulders. "
"17706800","17714750"," You'd have something like this down here."
"17717270","17718250"," Something like that."
"17720150","17724930"," You actually have some kind of an inverse head and shoulders here. "
"17724930","17727330"," There, there, there, there."
"17728630","17730410"," And then you're off and running to the upside."
"17732610","17735470"," I don't see the head and shoulders here. "
"17737190","17739170"," You'd have to get underneath the neckline."
"17739490","17741810"," You'd need that to be a shoulder, this to be a shoulder."
"17742290","17743270"," I don't see a head here either. "
"17744750","17745890"," That's a shoulder there."
"17746230","17746830"," That's your head."
"17747910","17749750"," Maybe that's what you're talking about over there. "
"17750630","17751350"," Something like that."
"17752210","17753170"," It's not forming yet."
"17754010","17758450"," Right now, inverse, definitely, definitely showing itself to the upside. "
"17767750","17770510"," Hopefully that didn't delete all my charts and shit over here."
"17771150","17774410"," A little bit of pullback here."
"17775410","17776770"," Still on trend to the upside. "
"17777290","17779130"," Look to see if this five-minute trigger holds."
"17788910","17789970"," Is there a dragon there?"
"17790130","17790930"," There might be a dragon here."
"17791310","17791710"," Is this a dragon?"
"17792610","17793530"," Let me look at a five-minute trigger. "
"17793670","17793810"," Hold on."
"17795870","17798630"," Yeah, is it a dragon?"
"17799290","17800650"," Looks like it's already done."
"17800670","17801850"," It's a dragon thing, doesn't it?"
"17802530","17804110"," It's got the tail back here. "
"17804430","17805110"," It's got the leg."
"17805690","17806830"," Maybe it needs another leg."
"17808470","17810010"," You guys know what the dragon looks like?"
"17811670","17813430"," It's got a big old tail right here. "
"17813530","17814290"," It's got the body."
"17815350","17816190"," Round here."
"17816890","17817450"," Another leg. "
"17818330","17819130"," Curls its head up."
"17820170","17821670"," And then it goes that way over there."
"17822890","17823870"," Like the tail, body. "
"17828690","17829890"," Balls over here."
"17831790","17833470"," Then a front leg."
"17834030","17835150"," Big dip by over there. "
"17835410","17836630"," And then you get your head over there."
"17839350","17840610"," The dragon formation."
"17842630","17845330"," We need one more leg. "
"17845850","17846450"," We're missing a leg."
"17846590","17848190"," We got one dragon leg right here."
"17850450","17852670"," He didn't take care of his nails. "
"17853210","17856830"," He needs another one over here."
"17859670","17860550"," There's the belly."
"17860990","17861810"," There's the head. "
"17862630","17863430"," To go up."
"17863650","17864550"," There's your head and shoulders."
"17864850","17866330"," The other inverse head and shoulders, by the way. "
"17871810","17873230"," You get the dragon."
"17873630","17875170"," My port to Valhalla agreed."
"17882830","17884130"," Let's quickly go over. "
"17884390","17891380"," I promised I would do CL Brent."
"17892840","17894300"," They're all kind of together right now."
"17894540","17895120"," It's a 30 minute chart. "
"17895360","17896780"," Let's take a look at CL and Brent."
"17897060","17897300"," Let's take a look."
"17900430","17900850"," CL. "
"17902870","17902890"," Okay."
"17904530","17905010"," 30 minute chart."
"17908170","17909730"," We have known sellers above. "
"17909730","17910970"," So let's look at this."
"17911290","17912050"," So CL."
"17917490","17919690"," We know we got supply up here, right?"
"17923460","17924800"," We know we have supply right here. "
"17924960","17927840"," I want you to know that oil in the market can go up."
"17929240","17932240"," They can also be related to late bull runs."
"17933220","17935820"," If the market goes up spies, not going to go. "
"17935880","17936600"," I've heard it all."
"17937000","17940420"," So we're at a nice big."
"17942220","17948840"," A nice big giant fat bull flag here, right?"
"17949060","17949460"," You see it?"
"17949880","17951860"," Boom, bull flag, bull flag. "
"17952640","17956540"," The idea here is that you're going to take."
"17956840","17957840"," Well, hold on."
"17958400","17958940"," That's not right. "
"17961500","17962100"," Easy."
"17962560","17963820"," Easy, Captain."
"17965780","17968920"," The idea here is an oil that you're going to squeeze this up. "
"17969680","17971300"," You're going to fail right there."
"17972320","17975100"," And then you're going to confirm the move higher."
"17976360","17976720"," Right?"
"17976920","17978660"," Here's your hourly trigger coming up. "
"17980920","17983120"," You could trade oil here for a quick trade."
"17984600","17985700"," You could trade that."
"17988140","17990460"," I'd really like to see the new high first. "
"17994260","17997600"," I'd like to see the new high first get up there, get the new high, and then I would like"
"17997600","18003340"," to see the hold of the hourly trigger right here and the daily trigger."
"18003680","18006160"," So let me draw this better for you."
"18006460","18008340"," So let me just draw it for you right now. "
"18008820","18010460"," And we'll just come back and check it in a few days."
"18011040","18013800"," So I'd like to see that right there."
"18015600","18017220"," And come back down here. "
"18018080","18019480"," And that's the real move right there."
"18021220","18029320"," There's going to be some more moves in here like zigzags and shit, but basically what you're"
"18029320","18032800"," looking for is, and this has to be somewhere right there."
"18034220","18035220"," That'd be my preference. "
"18036240","18037080"," Like right there."
"18039620","18040740"," But I really like this."
"18040960","18043880"," Now, if you're bullish on oil here, this is what I'll tell you to. "
"18045120","18046220"," It is the Widowmaker."
"18046780","18047560"," Gas is the Widowmaker."
"18048620","18055120"," You'll be placing a long calls or something on USO or some shit like that or in Brent or whatever,"
"18055680","18058440"," and you'll wake up tomorrow morning and price will be down here, right?"
"18058440","18063080"," So just know that this ain't like trading. "
"18063540","18065880"," This ain't like trade inspired or something."
"18066540","18070640"," When you wake up tomorrow and there's no stop for you is there."
"18071040","18072600"," I guess CL, there's a stop for you. "
"18072780","18081740"," But on any of the equity oil trades, you're trading like USO Brent or"
"18081740","18086980"," Ex-Alee or any of the underlying gas companies and producers."
"18087840","18091300"," You know, gas shippers, I like the idea behind tanker gang."
"18091820","18097040"," If you guys know what tanker gang is, I think tanker gang is the way to go in this oil"
"18097040","18106300"," and gas trade more than anything because you're going to get ports that are, ports that are, ports"
"18106300","18112520"," that are closed, you're going to get waterways that are monitored, you're going to get shipping"
"18112520","18117740"," containers, like oil tankers that are going to get turned away. "
"18118600","18119560"," They're going to get boarded."
"18120680","18125780"," So the tanker gang would be where I'd be on this trade, more so than oil or gas gang."
"18126560","18128180"," There's risk here of a roll to the downside. "
"18128480","18129280"," It's very dangerous."
"18129520","18131140"," Although I understand this trade that you're going to take."
"18131940","18132500"," I get it. "
"18132680","18134080"," I get you're going to take this trade tomorrow."
"18134360","18136000"," I get that you're going to buy this dip to go up."
"18136000","18138080"," But I would be also investigating. "
"18140280","18142500"," I would also be investigating."
"18144500","18148560"," This is the same setup right here for Brent, almost the exact same setup."
"18149640","18155820"," On Brent specifically, be careful of a rejection on this squeeze here. "
"18156140","18157280"," Matter of fact, we're going to go back to CL."
"18157540","18162720"," We'll take a look at CL again, but you might have that trade right there."
"18163800","18171240"," You would definitely want to see price above 89.14 before taking the next leg. "
"18173260","18175520"," So if you wanted that next leg right there."
"18177680","18178700"," Goes right there."
"18180100","18181540"," Then it comes back again. "
"18183340","18184900"," And then you get that one right there."
"18185880","18190620"," And you're looking for that hourly trigger to come back up right there and help with the daily"
"18190620","18191600"," trigger to the upside."
"18191600","18193720"," So there's Brent for you. "
"18193720","18194920"," I did Brent in CL."
"18198900","18200540"," Let me look at this in a higher time frame."
"18209280","18217830"," Dude, I'm telling you what, like Brent does not look good. "
"18221920","18230670"," Brent looks like, what Brent looks like to me is more like this."
"18233010","18234910"," I'm going to go with the rejection up here."
"18240960","18246320"," I think it rejects, I think Brent rejects 89.14 and it actually goes lower. "
"18248660","18250120"," I'll look at CL too."
"18261100","18262520"," I'll write it in here too."
"18262760","18263380"," Cap thinks this. "
"18300000","18301100"," That's October 18th."
"18307910","18309130"," That's what I think happens."
"18312030","18313630"," Let's take a look at CL really quick. "
"18316350","18317390"," Go back to CL."
"18318570","18320510"," And now CL looks a little bit better than Brent."
"18322810","18324410"," Looks a little bit better than Brent. "
"18326430","18328250"," Oh, no, that's Colgate-Palmall."
"18328410","18331650"," If I need the other CL, damn crude oil."
"18332430","18333930"," Like, why is that looking better than Brent?"
"18336550","18337410"," I'll be honest. "
"18337930","18345390"," I'm going to take this one right here."
"18348910","18350230"," I'm on that red trade."
"18350650","18351230"," I think it rejects. "
"18352110","18353690"," I think it's a trap up here."
"18359530","18365120"," I think there's a trap right here for oil."
"18365640","18369100"," I know it's going to make you go insane, but..."
"18384550","18386050"," I think somewhere in here you're going to get caught. "
"18390890","18392510"," I think you're going to get bounced around in here."
"18392570","18394630"," You're going to squeeze up and come down here."
"18395470","18395830"," Wham. "
"18397190","18398170"," Maybe there's a truce."
"18399430","18400490"," Maybe there's a truce."
"18404530","18408270"," Maybe they put together that deal and..."
"18408270","18409970"," Maybe they put the deal together with Saudi Arabia. "
"18410070","18411050"," Maybe there's something we don't see."
"18412670","18413830"," Market saying otherwise."
"18414370","18415330"," Market saying..."
"18415330","18421350"," The velocity at least is saying there's a fair chance of something. "
"18421850","18426330"," I'm assuming this would imply that there's an agreement with Saudi Arabia."
"18426950","18429250"," Maybe they step in as the..."
"18430070","18438250"," Maybe they step in as the..."
"18439830","18441910"," It would shock me to see this happen."
"18441910","18444350"," I don't believe this, but..."
"18446190","18449550"," I don't believe this will happen, but..."
"18453190","18453790"," Maybe..."
"18453790","18461250"," I couldn't even imagine or want to imagine Saudi Arabia as like the peacemakers. "
"18462390","18467470"," That shit would be like over this dead cold body or something, but..."
"18470330","18472170"," It would be a first, wouldn't it?"
"18472510","18477510"," Like you see them put together that deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia and Saudi Arabia, and then"
"18477510","18480770"," Saudi Arabia just like pops out and they're like, we're going to broker a peace deal."
"18481290","18483110"," Be like, what the fuck is that?"
"18483950","18486610"," I would not expect that to be real, but..."
"18486610","18487670"," You know, you got to say something."
"18487950","18491050"," I mean, I'm not a fan of Saudi Arabia. "
"18491650","18492430"," I don't..."
"18492430","18493930"," I'll never..."
"18493930","18494030"," Ever."
"18494330","18495130"," To the day I die."
"18495710","18496930"," Be a fan of Saudi Arabia. "
"18497170","18498110"," I apologize to you."
"18498550","18503170"," If you're Saudi Arabia and I might like you as a person, but the governments of Saudi Arabia, I"
"18503170","18503530"," apologize."
"18503870","18504870"," They'll never be my friend. "
"18505990","18506430"," And..."
"18508250","18508690"," But..."
"18508690","18511410"," You know that they're out there trying to buy Goodwill, right?"
"18511690","18513210"," They're doing it..."
"18514510","18517350"," Saudi Arabia is doing it, and then Qatar is doing it."
"18518470","18522130"," And they're trying to buy that Western..."
"18522830","18524910"," For lack of a better word, whitewashing."
"18529920","18531200"," That would be the shit. "
"18531400","18531840"," Not the shit."
"18532080","18533720"," Like a good thing that would catch me or anything."
"18533880","18537340"," It would be completely out of left field, wouldn't it?"
"18538420","18540220"," It would be completely out of left field. "
"18541920","18544000"," Is anybody talking about that out there or no?"
"18545180","18548260"," I haven't heard anybody talking about that, but can you imagine that shit?"
"18548920","18551580"," I think that would be the one thing no one would see coming."
"18554200","18554900"," Everyone's doing good."
"18555020","18555300"," How are you doing?"
"18555400","18555940"," Where are we?"
"18555940","18556520"," How are you doing, brother?"
"18557340","18559460"," It's a good day. "
"18560080","18565180"," If CL goes up like this in the overnight, you should see some weakness in spy, right?"
"18565420","18565500"," It should."
"18565740","18572420"," It has been correlating somewhat with the market, but maybe you do see a little bit of weakness in"
"18572420","18572660"," spy."
"18572940","18573640"," A little bit of..."
"18573640","18574740"," I don't know. "
"18575420","18577360"," I hate correlating oil with spy."
"18578300","18578700"," I hate it."
"18579640","18580920"," It's where I usually get burned. "
"18582440","18583920"," I'm a dick pill dragon."
"18590380","18594570"," That's all I think I got for you guys."
"18594770","18596330"," I think I got too much more for you guys. "
"18605340","18608720"," PT1, PT2, parking it in the bell."
"18610680","18612740"," Almost a cross for bears here."
"18612960","18614280"," They almost have their cross. "
"18614760","18616200"," They're holding themselves right now."
"18616320","18617840"," They're like, is it going to squeeze into the bell?"
"18617940","18618700"," I'm going to get run over."
"18623400","18625680"," Am I safe putting my puts on?"
"18626060","18627700"," You know what the bears want here, right?"
"18628920","18629440"," They want that. "
"18629840","18632300"," The bear is going to tell you they want that pullback, right?"
"18633800","18636180"," Over here, if you pay attention down below."
"18636820","18639540"," They're like, just pull it down a little bit so I can make some money right here."
"18639640","18641260"," You can go back and buy that later, Cap. "
"18641960","18642880"," That's what they're telling you."
"18644040","18645220"," It's going to make a little bit of money, Cap."
"18645360","18645760"," It's a little bit of money. "
"18645860","18646680"," I'm just going to put some puts on."
"18647320","18648600"," Close them on the opening bell tomorrow."
"18655980","18656520"," Oh, dude. "
"18657500","18659340"," I'm at the mall in a fight."
"18659480","18661920"," I almost broke up between two women because of the Middle East stuff."
"18662000","18662840"," Stay safe out there. "
"18663560","18663880"," Yeah."
"18664120","18664700"," It's a good point."
"18667140","18667760"," I would. "
"18668880","18672600"," You know, I don't want to like get away from what happened this morning."
"18672900","18675780"," I'm going to say to you that I'm going to read."
"18675960","18676200"," It's a good. "
"18676240","18677120"," Thanks for bringing that up."
"18677240","18677600"," Who brought that?"
"18677720","18678140"," Was that crazy?"
"18678760","18679820"," That was crazy, Eddie."
"18680300","18682140"," So maybe bring up some other points here. "
"18682420","18682560"," Okay."
"18684220","18685460"," Based on what just crazy."
"18685460","18687920"," He said, I want you to remember something from this morning. "
"18687920","18688280"," Okay."
"18690380","18691320"," They're hedging this market."
"18691960","18693240"," I assure you of that. "
"18693240","18695240"," The market's being hedged right now."
"18695280","18696360"," You're given a reprieve."
"18698760","18700520"," Two heads yourself in this market. "
"18700840","18705140"," I told you that if we trade the daily trigger, it's a good place to put on a put back"
"18705140","18705460"," spread."
"18706680","18710820"," You could wake up tomorrow and everything could be different."
"18712020","18712280"," Crazy. "
"18712580","18716160"," Eddie just said that he saw two of them get into a fight at the mall."
"18716600","18719180"," So I want you to know that."
"18721660","18723780"," I've I've been to the Middle East. "
"18724400","18726180"," I need you to know."
"18726980","18729040"," Between you and I, I'm going to tell you something."
"18731500","18733200"," Really fucked up shit happens. "
"18734280","18736720"," I'm not going to discuss what happens or what I've seen."
"18737400","18740020"," I'm going to tell you that nothing shocks me."
"18740820","18741880"," From the Middle East. "
"18742320","18747820"," And just like this morning when we went over this stuff with Hamas and."
"18750440","18753180"," Hezbollah and Israel."
"18753940","18758320"," I want you to know that you can make internet comments so you can. "
"18758780","18761040"," We can do whatever we want on a stream."
"18762080","18766560"," But in real life, like IRL real life, be careful out there."
"18767320","18768860"," People get very emotional. "
"18770340","18771400"," And forget the emotion."
"18771960","18774080"," There are people out there that."
"18775960","18779220"," Have been through things you could never imagine. "
"18779940","18782980"," And this goes for Palestinians goes for."
"18783880","18787540"," Israelis and specifically Israeli Jewish people."
"18788500","18791520"," Have been through a lot and these people. "
"18793960","18794280"," Don't."
"18794760","18799660"," I'm not going to think like you think if you're just a normal person in life, their thoughts on"
"18799660","18800340"," these things."
"18801620","18805200"," Can be like, you know, if you're like an American, let's say, and. "
"18806040","18809060"," You say something like if I ever catch someone."
"18809580","18811480"," Pedital and a child or something, right."
"18812780","18814920"," You'd you'd kill that motherfucker, right. "
"18815720","18819200"," They have similar feelings about what's going on right now."
"18819200","18824700"," So you may think that you know, put yourself in their position, but you may."
"18824940","18827700"," You may be like in real life out there. "
"18827720","18829460"," You don't want to be anywhere near that."
"18829460","18832060"," You just want to step to the side and remove yourself."
"18833120","18835500"," So leave you with that warning in public. "
"18836260","18836940"," Stay away."
"18837060","18837660"," Stay out of it."
"18837860","18844540"," Like don't be getting into fights in the malls with other women and stuff like that or other men. "
"18846980","18849740"," It's like really sketchy times right now."
"18849960","18853520"," So oil looks like it's going to go up tomorrow."
"18854320","18856960"," You have a chance today to hedge the market. "
"18856960","18857840"," I leave you with that."
"18858620","18862600"," If you don't have a hedge in this market and you're just running, holding your dick out there and"
"18862600","18863860"," you think everything is fine."
"18864560","18867900"," I can assure you that this market is hedged at this point without a doubt. "
"18868720","18875080"," And if anything bad happens publicly, that involves or brings America into this fight."
"18876480","18877560"," It could be anything."
"18878100","18880620"," Please, please be hedged for that. "
"18882480","18884020"," You never know what's going to happen."
"18890860","18892620"," Yeah, I wouldn't be doing that."
"18892980","18895180"," I wouldn't be doing that. "
"18896760","18898260"," I wouldn't be doing that."
"18898660","18900660"," It's just like that police officer in Egypt."
"18901220","18903040"," He just he just shot to his really tourists. "
"18904520","18907640"," That guy wasn't done any orders from his bosses or anything."
"18907640","18911580"," It was like one person who was like fuck that."
"18911660","18912460"," I'm going to get some of mine. "
"18912820","18916880"," And when you're when you went around people like that or near people like that, you don't know what"
"18916880","18917360"," they're going to do."
"18917460","18918320"," You honestly don't."
"18921340","18928720"," Maybe if you're Arab or Muslim or Jewish or Israeli or Israeli Arab, I don't know. "
"18929100","18930340"," Maybe you want to chime in."
"18930420","18932820"," You can if you want in the chat about this."
"18934460","18935820"," I wouldn't be doing it publicly. "
"18937340","18942160"," My own business and let the people that are dealing with this deal with this."
"18947170","18948410"," Yeah, I can't do it."
"18948410","18952210"," I miss talking monkeys saying 99% of people are taking sides. "
"18952210","18954150"," I was actually having an understanding of the history of this."
"18955190","18957110"," I don't even know how I'll tell you."
"18957150","18959990"," I don't even know how to discuss it. "
"18960850","18965010"," I would probably have to write out like a 10 page dissertation."
"18967730","18970530"," Just to say I've learned this stuff."
"18970770","18977230"," And even then when you learn that stuff, it's not what's really the experience of a lot of these"
"18977230","18978250"," people on both sides. "
"18979450","18986150"," A lot of the history making, no matter which side you're reading it from, isn't the reality of"
"18986150","18986830"," life."
"18987550","18994170"," Not just the victors being able to write that history, but the personal experience of people and"
"18994170","18996090"," how they act on a one to one basis."
"18996570","18997450"," It's so different. "
"18998550","18999570"," You know what it reminds me of?"
"18999650","19005350"," It reminds me of people that are armchair attorneys and then they don't actually ever go to court."
"19006070","19007450"," I have to go to court."
"19007610","19008230"," I have businesses. "
"19008670","19009910"," I find myself in court."
"19011110","19014010"," It's nothing like the 97 million to the south side."
"19014090","19019970"," It's nothing like someone on the internet telling you what's legal, what's not, what works, what"
"19019970","19020510"," doesn't. "
"19021510","19030310"," Your own experience, your mileage will vary versus what you think is the facts."
"19030310","19031090"," Right?"
"19031470","19035670"," So even if we get the facts, like even if I'm like, yeah, I just did a 10 page dissertation"
"19035670","19037510"," to the tick."
"19037910","19040390"," And this is how I stand on this issue right now. "
"19040490","19045650"," Market profile levels, which is signing up to the tick dot com, which is likely what you need,"
"19045650","19046050"," right?"
"19046830","19052590"," If you're going to defend either side, you likely need a 10 page dissertation as to what you're"
"19052590","19056690"," defending, what you're not defending, what you can defend, what you want to see, what you wish was"
"19056690","19059830"," happening, who wasn't in charge, who was pulling the strings, who's not."
"19059830","19060930"," All this other fucking nonsense."
"19062570","19069730"," And even then we're not scratching the surface of the real experiences of all these people"
"19069730","19069910"," involved. "
"19071410","19075470"," If anything, I would just become my lucky stars that I'm not there right now."
"19076560","19078470"," Would not want to be there right now."
"19082190","19084590"," Yeah, it's just layers and layers of mess. "
"19085390","19085910"," It's a constant."
"19086650","19089410"," It's a pile of shit."
"19090130","19090970"," It really is. "
"19090970","19094150"," When you look at it as a whole pile of shit."
"19096890","19101970"," And to get dragged in the middle of it is like, I guess you can do it as an armchair."
"19102890","19109210"," Like, you know, I got my got my Middle East relations certification from the from high school of"
"19109210","19110070"," Reddit. "
"19110070","19114510"," And then my dissertation was done on YouTube University."
"19115530","19122030"," I'm still waiting for YouTube University to come out with a bunch of hour long videos, but I assure"
"19122030","19123070"," you by next weekend."
"19124590","19127350"," I too will be a certified Middle East experts. "
"19130170","19133030"," But this is probably not the expert you want to become."
"19135450","19138470"," You don't want to become an expert at Middle East relations."
"19142670","19146770"," I mean, we can respectfully agree or disagree on Ukraine and Russia. "
"19147670","19148690"," All day long."
"19149230","19149710"," Right."
"19150630","19151970"," He'd be like, yeah, fuck you, Cap. "
"19152790","19153990"," I disagree with you."
"19154310","19156370"," I still believe Russia should have that buffer."
"19157150","19158790"," And I'd be like, yeah, he's got a good point. "
"19159190","19159370"," Right."
"19159490","19161130"," It's pretty fucking straightforward and simple."
"19161910","19163310"," Like a Middle Eastern stuff. "
"19164050","19164990"," Like, fuck no."
"19165710","19166910"," One nothing to do with it."
"19166910","19171490"," Senior U.S. defense official on the Hamas attacks as the U.S. is searching for to Israel, including"
"19171490","19172550"," air defense and munitions. "
"19174770","19176990"," Oh, is Jimmy over there right now or no?"
"19177950","19179030"," Is he over there right now?"
"19179350","19179810"," I got a call."
"19179910","19180370"," I'll call him today."
"19181110","19182870"," I got a signal in his cell phone. "
"19183350","19185390"," If that's if he's really doing that fucking amen."
"19186990","19189030"," I don't doubt that he would be over there right now."
"19189150","19189690"," Is he over there?"
"19190330","19190710"," Fuck you. "
"19190790","19191290"," I'll call him tonight."
"19191690","19193270"," I'll touch a base of them tonight."
"19195910","19198050"," I'll touch a base of them tonight if he's over there. "
"19198670","19200670"," I love my man James Roland, brother."
"19200790","19201370"," He's a good friend of mine."
"19202750","19204110"," So I hope he's safe right now. "
"19205450","19207750"," He probably won't have to serve, though."
"19208010","19209150"," There's some requirements."
"19209450","19210630"," You have to, like, speak full Hebrew. "
"19211610","19213310"," You have to, like, have done it."
"19213510","19215190"," Like, you have to, like, come back to..."
"19215190","19215670"," I don't know if..."
"19215670","19218770"," I don't think he ever did go back to Israel to serve his two years yet."
"19219910","19221230"," I think it's two years you serve. "
"19222710","19223810"," But I don't think that he has."
"19224170","19226010"," I don't recall him telling me that he did it."
"19226970","19232580"," Yeah, I'll say something to him. "
"19232580","19233580"," I'll tell him to give me a call tonight."
"19233960","19236080"," I'll reach out to him on Finn to it."
"19236540","19237980"," I don't want to see him get hurt either. "
"19238700","19239560"," He's a handsome man."
"19241720","19242640"," He's got a new wife."
"19242780","19243480"," He's got to make babies. "
"19245280","19246700"," That's young people's stuff."
"19246900","19250020"," You want to send young people to do that stupid shit?"
"19250020","19256260"," I'm going to test the five minute trigger right now on Spy."
"19256780","19258360"," We want to see if they can get this cross. "
"19258700","19263360"," If you are a seller, you want to see this rejection so you can confirm the deal."
"19263520","19265400"," I want to talk about something here briefly if it could."
"19266500","19270380"," This doesn't matter if we're going up or down, but I want to show you this. "
"19274350","19276010"," Right now, it happens to be down."
"19277230","19278130"," So, I want to..."
"19278130","19280310"," This is kind of a fun little exercise here."
"19281630","19283310"," I'm going to go back to a trigger screen. "
"19283510","19290010"," I don't do this as much with you as I used to, but you can see this is the pudetal"
"19290010","19290710"," in the middle, right?"
"19293430","19298370"," Just inside of here and inside of here."
"19299870","19301730"," You never want to get caught in here, okay?"
"19303170","19305450"," Never want to get caught inside this here."
"19305650","19307910"," This is no-go zone, okay?"
"19308290","19308790"," No-go zone. "
"19310330","19320160"," But if you break below this no-go zone, or above this no-go"
"19320160","19325600"," zone, and you can confirm the move lower or higher."
"19326300","19327000"," Move that over."
"19327860","19333380"," You can confirm that move, and normally how it goes is you'll have the initial break like we have"
"19333380","19334080"," right now, right?"
"19334820","19336360"," You're not short here, by the way. "
"19339000","19341980"," You're waiting for the rejection candle right here."
"19342980","19343680"," Hold on."
"19344320","19348240"," You're waiting for this candle to turn red and reject. "
"19348760","19351980"," So, typically you're looking for the blood down, right?"
"19352460","19355360"," You're looking for the pullback up, and then the rejection."
"19356220","19363120"," If you get that rejection here, you set up the puts for here or the short for here, and you"
"19363120","19364640"," only instigate it on the rejection."
"19365440","19369000"," So, right now what's happening, you don't fuck with this. "
"19369800","19375640"," You're looking for green candles that fail to regain that red line."
"19376000","19376940"," So, let's look at this one bigger."
"19378200","19379240"," So, right here. "
"19380860","19382580"," This is positive for bears."
"19384620","19385400"," That's positive."
"19386760","19387520"," Failure to buy. "
"19388660","19390160"," And you're starting to get the blood right here."
"19390160","19397500"," And you can likely set up some puts or shorts on a successful break of this previous low right"
"19397500","19397740"," here."
"19398340","19399540"," So, this one right here. "
"19404560","19406060"," You can see it right there happening."
"19406960","19408380"," Watch them slam it down right now."
"19411640","19414140"," And they're going to try to break below this previous low. "
"19414380","19415860"," Same thing works upside down."
"19415960","19417180"," We're going up the same thing works."
"19418620","19421920"," So, they're trying to break below this previous low right here. "
"19425200","19426060"," Haven't done it yet."
"19436300","19442700"," And your target to the downside will be 430."
"19444980","19446240"," 430 to the downside. "
"19446680","19447760"," So, we'll watch this into this close."
"19449200","19450500"," See all this rejection right here?"
"19452320","19457300"," We'll talk about, um, we'll write this in for you."
"19462450","19463070"," Short. "
"19466550","19468010"," Below the yellow bar."
"19470450","19472010"," Below the yellow bar."
"19476210","19479310"," Another place if you're really bear should be to enter up here. "
"19492250","19497070"," And your stop on this short right here is going to be up here."
"19516230","19517750"," So, if we, if we squeeze."
"19522700","19524420"," So, let's say right now we squeeze up. "
"19525380","19526800"," You put the short on right here."
"19528560","19531280"," Put the short on right there for that exponential move down right."
"19532340","19534480"," If the short goes against you here. "
"19535340","19537100"," If that short goes against you."
"19537960","19539500"," So, you'll be taking this short."
"19539700","19541560"," Let's pretend you take a short and it goes against you. "
"19541960","19542960"," It would squeeze up here."
"19543640","19545560"," And likely come back down."
"19547300","19548460"," Before it went higher. "
"19549400","19550980"," So, you put the short on right here."
"19551700","19552540"," And you get squeezed."
"19553220","19554560"," You don't actually close your short. "
"19554860","19556740"," You hold on to it until it comes back down."
"19557280","19559800"," And this is where you take your short off somewhere down in here."
"19561280","19564220"," I don't know if that, any of that's making sense but to you or not. "
"19564420","19564820"," Maybe it does."
"19565460","19567660"," We don't talk about that trading much anymore."
"19567860","19569480"," We need to get back into it for you guys. "
"19569480","19572800"," Because we do this training stuff."
"19573120","19578140"," We're going to discuss not getting caught."
"19579200","19581300"," The behaviors that you're looking for. "
"19583140","19584880"," So, you didn't take the short here right?"
"19585300","19586580"," Because we didn't get below the yellow."
"19587560","19590360"," So, now is your next opportunity to go short is right here."
"19594900","19597100"," You got to break above this right here. "
"19598120","19599880"," Or fail to break above, excuse me."
"19603290","19604610"," Watch them step in right now."
"19604690","19605530"," They're going to try to sell this. "
"19613070","19613610"," Let's see it."
"19613650","19617250"," Hopefully, hopefully this guy gets run over because I want to show you what to do if you get run"
"19617250","19618070"," over in this trade."
"19619030","19622650"," I'm hoping that this, the hoping that somebody took a short and they're going to get run over. "
"19624390","19628610"," And that you'll get a chance to get out of it, like right there."
"19634440","19634880"," Oh, good."
"19635080","19635700"," It's going to get run over. "
"19635840","19637200"," So, watch this short get run over."
"19637440","19638380"," Pretend you're short right now."
"19638380","19641280"," And you're like sweating panicking. "
"19641800","19643960"," You don't sweat and panic here to be honest with you."
"19646200","19647620"," So, you're short right now."
"19647920","19649460"," Tell me when you get stopped out of this. "
"19650940","19654060"," Because they'll squeeze you out here and you're going to should have actually gotten out right"
"19654060","19654460"," about here."
"19657980","19659180"," Let's watch this into the close."
"19659620","19660600"," It's a good way to close the day. "
"19660760","19661900"," It's 3.50, 10 minutes left."
"19680140","19683460"," We'll show how to trade a short position."
"19684080","19687180"," So, this guy is still short. "
"19687420","19688100"," He's sweating bullets."
"19689180","19691080"," Now, he sees the big green bar here."
"19691220","19692940"," He's like, oh, shit. "
"19693780","19694560"," Please go down."
"19694700","19695400"," Please go down."
"19695560","19696240"," Please go down. "
"19700480","19702660"," You could take the money and run here."
"19707220","19713930"," Back over there for you."
"19717520","19719060"," What do I think of NVIDIA this week?"
"19719540","19720380"," Let's talk about NVIDIA. "
"19720380","19721240"," We'll come back to spy."
"19721440","19722520"," We'll look at it in a minute."
"19723680","19724040"," NVIDIA. "
"19724980","19726380"," What do I think about NVIDIA this week?"
"19738170","19738530"," Push."
"19741370","19748210"," And buy the dip on NVIDIA at $4.49.47. And you're going to buy the dip on $4.40."
"19748610","19750130"," Let me just check a couple of things here for you."
"19750130","19753970"," Let's make sure that'll hold here. "
"19756840","19758180"," Yeah, I think you're good to go."
"19759820","19760500"," Ish."
"19762920","19769160"," I think you're going to find your dip buy is right here. "
"19771260","19779360"," You're a dip buyer at $4.48.17. $4.48.17, you're a dip buyer."
"19780380","19784780"," So, NVIDIA, you're a dip buyer at $4.47. So, you're a dip buyer right here."
"19787260","19788240"," Dip buyer. "
"19791220","19793160"," And you are a seller."
"19794720","19800560"," You are a seller below $4.42.40. You become a seller down below here."
"19801760","19802880"," Sorry, you lost. "
"19808010","19810730"," Now, what do I think NVIDIA is doing?"
"19810850","19819110"," I think NVIDIA has shown you in Friday that the correction was over."
"19820310","19830630"," But if you do begin to see rejection below $4.42, stuff like this, the action like that, get"
"19830630","19831230"," the fuck out."
"19833210","19835830"," You will go down and get a new low. "

"19912820","19915020"," Do you get a chance to exit a short?"
"19915220","19916140"," Now you're upside down."
"19916400","19919600"," You're in the pain trade right now. "
"19920380","19923620"," You're down 300, you're down 400, you're down 500 bucks."

"20000110","20002190"," You got a little bit of a touch right there."
"20004490","20007630"," You're giving a little bit of a respite for this one. "
"20007690","20008870"," You might get one more."
"20010050","20011870"," I don't know, that might have been your reversal."
"20012110","20013870"," They might have given you one candle right there. "

"20054690","20056370"," You're giving a chance to get out right there. "
"20056430","20058270"," That candle right there was like, get out."
"20060090","20060970"," It's out."
"20063910","20065390"," It's like the Amityville house. "
"20068550","20069270"," All right."
"20069390","20069970"," I'm getting out."
"20076880","20080500"," One other thing I want to leave you with today here is you ready?"
"20082060","20087960"," If cash market can't put us up over that daily trigger, futures will. "
"20090720","20091640"," Futures will."
"20093560","20094920"," Yeah, I see that."
"20095220","20097480"," I see that gap up in the overnight. "
"20098140","20101900"," Sigorin 77 is like, I'm fucking trading that gap up in the overnight."
"20103300","20105000"," I see the gap up, Sigorin."
"20105900","20107240"," I see that gap up, brother. "
"20117110","20122930"," The truth or the truth that I'm talking about, it would be the truth that I'm talking about would"
"20122930","20125210"," be not the kind of truth you're thinking of."
"20125630","20128690"," I should rephrase what I meant when I said that statement that I made."
"20129630","20137390"," The truth that I'm talking about is where the scary truth that I'm talking about, the one that I'm"
"20137390","20146950"," talking about is where you kind of have a, like a coal trap. "
"20147230","20156670"," It would be a Hamas has below trap where the being trapped by Arabs and Muslim nations that are"
"20156670","20158310"," going to try to trap them in there."
"20158490","20160830"," I don't want to talk about this because I don't know that it."
"20161050","20167770"," I don't know what that would happen, but you know, it's something like this is very similar. "
"20171930","20173570"," You're setting your friend up."
"20173810","20177130"," It was bad to say, but you're setting your friend up for failure."
"20177630","20178510"," Does that make sense to you?"
"20179890","20183010"," You like, you tell your buddy, you're like, all right, buddy, come on over here. "
"20183030","20185530"," You're like, I want you to go through there and start a fucking fight."
"20186350","20190930"," And you know that your buddy is the only person that's trying to fight."
"20193370","20196890"," And he runs right into a wall of fucked up shit. "
"20196890","20205910"," And meanwhile, you're, you've already made a deal with those other people."
"20206210","20215710"," This would be kind of a deal between like Saudi Arabia, Arabia, Qatar, and throw an Iran under a"
"20215710","20215930"," bus."
"20218550","20225950"," And teaming up with, I know, sounds so fucking bizarre with like a, like some kind of like a peace"
"20225950","20226690"," deal, right?"
"20227210","20227970"," It's not a truce. "
"20228150","20233570"," It's like a peace deal where they all try to suck each other off and act like they did it."
"20234310","20236170"," Now, I don't think that's going to happen."
"20237090","20242210"," Like, I think that's some of my dead body type of shit, but the way Qatar and Saudi Arabia have"
"20242210","20246610"," been doing recently, I wouldn't put it to pass and try to do something fucked up like that. "
"20248030","20255810"," And I don't, I haven't seen anybody talking about that, but it would, it would, all the pieces of"
"20255810","20258050"," the puzzle would fit into why we're here right now."
"20258610","20259670"," Now, they most certainly would."
"20261090","20264930"," All those questions that people have as to why we're here and how do we get here and a lot"
"20264930","20270350"," of the stuff, not the injustices that have been done of Palestinians or the overbearing of the"
"20270350","20271710"," Israeli government and all that kind of stuff. "
"20271870","20273930"," Not all that stuff that you don't want, don't get involved in any of that crap."
"20274790","20275930"," Just like, why are we here?"
"20276390","20278150"," Like, who's the hands in the background?"
"20278630","20279570"," Who's setting all this up?"
"20280250","20282110"," Why is it happening the way that it's happening?"
"20282910","20288970"," I realize it's a chance to try to get rid of that agreement from taking place between Saudi Arabia"
"20288970","20292110"," and Israel, but they could have been a setup too."
"20292670","20295710"," You know, that would be bizarre as fuck, wouldn't it?"
"20302810","20305790"," Sure, it's getting squeezed right now into this bell. "
"20306350","20309610"," We are setting up for some kind of a gap up in the overnight tomorrow."
"20310270","20311110"," I think it's dangerous."
"20311430","20312190"," I'm still long here. "
"20312190","20314630"," I want to see that daily trigger get slapped."
"20315350","20316590"," I want it."
"20316850","20317410"," Like, we're there. "
"20318070","20322510"," We have every reason to go there and find out if buyers are stronger than sellers."
"20323950","20325830"," So, let's do it."
"20326170","20326950"," Squeeze on up, baby. "
"20327130","20328470"," Give me that daily trigger by open tomorrow."
"20329270","20331530"," Price target by open, 434 or higher."
"20332770","20333790"," 435 would be the number. "
