"4065980","4075970"," where the bears are right here first style side is we're going to come up here test all this"
"4075970","4093580"," bullshit we want to take the trade up in here or"

"4117100","4126939"," got your thing you don't have to watch it now just go back and watch it I gave you most"
"4126939","4136540"," of the reasons but it's also OPEC's right so you've got large uh players out there that want"
"4136540","4142740"," their spreads to print those from the Fedreversary purpose in the team we want their flies to print"
"4142740","4152540"," they want their spreads to print so you've got a pin we like we likely won't bloodbath"

"4158160","4164600"," by signing up at to the tick dot com not like bloodbath that we likely won't not into the 30th"
"4164600","4170500"," we might have like a bad day or two but like only a bad day or something but it'll likely"
"4170500","4180850"," be bought up into the first and the second then you'll get some full mowers to jump in and then"
"4180850","4187890"," in that video I talked to you a lot about volatility one hundred and then you can't afford to take"
"4187890","4195570"," two spot two nine five trillion dollars at the Fedreversary corporation all that kind of stuff and"
"4195570","4209150"," all that stuff is about all this we should"
"4209150","4218980"," melt up into early May possibly mid May but somewhere in there we should now"
"4218980","4227500"," we can break that mold we can have a big rollover we start getting a bunch of battery ports on"
"4227500","4235380"," heavy hitters start getting sell the news so the key here though is if you get the so if you"
"4235380","4240080"," get the let's see you get the sell the news on big tech what if it what do we squeeze"
"4240080","4246900"," big tech up one last push on their ER then it rolls over right so let's just say big tech"
"4246900","4256600"," has pretty good earnings right let's just say big tech has good earnings and generally"
"4256600","4262780"," speaking they have good earnings so they're going to all report let's say you get a squeeze up that"
"4262780","4269880"," the day of the earnings and then they roll over right let me start selling in that first video I"
"4269880","4273620"," talked to you and said well there's probably a good short in there on on those specific big tech"
"4273620","4282560"," names but the S&P 500 and IWM will likely trade sideways and up to let other companies report"
"4282560","4292260"," or sideways and down but not crash so like like the market crash idea you need volatility"
"4293920","4301080"," outside of that stuff to get the price of spy or S&P down significantly but you can be down"
"4301080","4308440"," some but you're not going to be down like 10% 13% just based on four big selling for"
"4308440","4316120"," big tech companies because they're rotating in other sectors in the business cycle right now so we"
"4316120","4321020"," are in supply above we know that this is not to be expected we know that the bears are here"
"4321020","4327120"," right just pointed that out to the bears are sitting there sell side is on here trying to sell and"
"4327120","4336990"," not allow this to happen you know i'm flat you know i'm just looking to get an entry"
"4336990","4347160"," this is a five-minute chart you know what i'm looking for here i'm"
"4347160","4356940"," looking to pick up the five-minute down here 413 79 for a run higher or i'm looking for a"
"4356940","4365320"," break above this volatility and turn this into consolidation for that next trip higher so there's"
"4365320","4369220"," the money right there for at least for me and the one i want to put on right there and"
"4369220","4376920"," here's the money for me and actually down here too on this hourly trigger i wouldn't even mind us"
"4376920","4381740"," selling off down here to the hourly and taking some time for that swing higher any of that kind of"
"4381740","4397580"," stuff yeah there's"
"4397580","4404620"," two and a half sessions we got what thursday friday we guess there we could get a roll after"
"4404620","4412340"," thursday but then we've end of month two that's my issue here is you've got one more session for"
"4412340","4422260"," opex and then you've got the thirtieth which is end of month option expiry another big day"
"4422260","4435670"," it's like option expiry and uh tomorrow's thursday's expiry sorry if"
"4435670","4445490"," you look at all that shit with earnings you need a vol event to get"
"4445490","4451990"," real blood so uh we were trying this morning to look for like is there a vol event that could"
"4451990","4458150"," create that not outside of earnings i don't know what what there is right now i don't think that"
"4458150","4465910"," it's i don't think that it's the rate increases if we pause and have one or two rate increases this"
"4465910","4474010"," year uh i think that's in the third right so you got the fed you got fed fed chair could"
"4474010","4478810"," introduce some vol but uh which i think you get vol from that but i don't think that it's like"
"4478810","4488760"," market crash ball i think that's the big thing is is it market"
"4488760","4495960"," crash ball or not so two targets down below we have our first one down here this is my first"
"4495960","4500840"," place where i said i'd like to buy a dip here and my second place where i'd like to buy"
"4500840","4510820"," a dip is down here okay so these are the two"
"4510820","4515800"," places where i want to buy a dip now saying that hey i want to buy a dip down here"
"4515800","4524960"," i have some other requirements right i don't want to begin to trade underneath the one in five"
"4524960","4533780"," minute let me uh delete some of this stuff for you i'm gonna get"
"4533780","4543620"," rid of that six for you so what i don't want to do when i'm setting this"
"4543620","4554060"," trade up what i don't want to happen is to buy the dip too early so this"
"4554060","4560780"," if you're a bull pay attention this actually works in the reverse for beers too so what i don't"
"4560780","4571510"," want to see is a reversal here a rejection"
"4571510","4583350"," of price off the white line and we just start bloodbath in it here right i don't"
"4583350","4590410"," want to get caught in that do i so if that's the case i don't get caught in that if"
"4590410","4602870"," we roll if we roll here i'm going to give it some time to consolidate and watch"
"4602870","4616000"," this actually reverse like this and reverse like this and this"
"4616000","4623600"," is where the money is right in here that's that money trade that i'm talking about so i want to"
"4623600","4631200"," see that so this is what oftentimes where a bull or a beer gets caught in consolidation and it can"
"4631200","4638180"," go against either one of them so you you want confirmation that we're going higher or lower before"
"4638180","4643340"," you even take the trade anyone that takes these trades they win but they don't win like a winning"
"4643340","4652680"," trade wins like hey if i have nine kick-ass trades and i have one loser it's not so bad"
"4652680","4660180"," right like you want you want though you want the high percentage probability trades so you're"
"4660180","4667440"," looking for this the other idea here is do we just confirm if you're a bull who says i can't"
"4667440","4672760"," say what we'll decide at the next meeting do we are we just confirming the five-minute here we know"
"4672760","4677840"," we have sellers up here we have supply up here and they're not going to make it easy for you"
"4677840","4685160"," to get above so even when we are just at this moment you're looking for price to show you the"
"4685160","4694900"," way right so if price is able to regain"
"4694900","4700600"," and show you the way here there might be a trade from here to here we can make some money"
"4700600","4708700"," but still we know these sellers are here so my preferred trade into tomorrow thursday"
"4708700","4719010"," thursday and friday what do i care about this let's"
"4719010","4725750"," be honest like if you're watching this program right now does this mean anything to you if you're a"
"4725750","4735570"," bull right now fuck no all this is right here"
"4735570","4745400"," is an opportunity for you to take a break get a sandwich take a piss and"
"4745400","4755360"," wait for this to resolve okay resolve either for a continuation higher"
"4755360","4765100"," where you jump back on the money train consolidate sideways until the one"
"4765100","4776930"," and five-minute becomes supportive to jump back on the money train right resolve"
"4776930","4786760"," or if you're a bear you're looking for if you're like hey i love the sell the shirt"
"4786760","4796100"," side cap and i fucking hate uh buying this market i got you i feel you i understand so you"
"4796100","4803480"," need to see price get underneath the one minute you did that good job now you need price to reject"
"4803480","4808260"," the one and get underneath the five-minute you need price to do this i'm going to make it green"
"4808260","4814580"," bars but i don't look sorry for some contrast but you want to see this and you want to see"
"4814580","4820280"," this because you're getting indicators saying that that we're going lower there's a one rejection"
"4820280","4828300"," right there there's a second rejection right there and there's the bear money trade below this four"
"4828300","4832480"," i think it's four thirteen twenty i think it might be higher now i'll find out where this is um"
"4832480","4842080"," i haven't looked at it in a little bit here i'll probably have to um adjust where that is that's"
"4843460","4851760"," at four thirteen thirty nine so i should probably move this up four thirteen thirty nine right here"
"4851760","4858920"," right now so basically you need to get underneath all this shit all this garbage need to get"
"4858920","4868650"," underneath to go down as of right now the move is higher i can assure"
"4868650","4878640"," you you might not know this hold on there's likely a fly holder out there that's"
"4878640","4888530"," like we can go all the way to four twenty and i'll be so they"
"4888530","4898130"," don't care if we go up here when they're also going to likely close tomorrow on thursday or even"

"5382160","5386940"," hourly a four-hour and a daily chart and depending upon the trade that i'm taking you sound like"
"5386940","5394180"," you know what you're doing depending on the trade that you're taking i'm looking for trend with"
"5394180","5405280"," velocity oversold under under overbought or oversold on different time frames with"
"5405280","5415240"," velocity to the upper downside i'm assuming if you understand how to write emas how to how to write"
"5415240","5424920"," um your own emas"
"5427420","5432520"," and i calculated all of those time frames together give me an outlook for where we're going and"
"5432520","5436320"," then look for crossovers on the one or five minutes i used to trade the one minute on the show"
"5436320","5444880"," and i stopped because uh people were like not understanding everything and then they were uh trying"
"5444880","5451740"," to trade with me and so with the delay they might not get the best entries and exits so now"
"5451740","5457000"," i've switched to a five-minute chart which slows the entire process down for people gives them a"
"5457000","5468270"," breathing room so they can enter a trade staying it longer and try to monetize yeah"

"5479830","5490340"," unless i use this six right now see i get it but"
"5490340","5494480"," i'm looking for bullish crosses and bearish crosses in multiple time time frames pretty fairly"
"5494480","5505500"," simple and easy and straightforward right now this is a one-minute chart this"
"5505500","5518640"," is a green bar is an hourly trigger here i'll show you some cool blade combine that"
"5518640","5530180"," with um dome or order flow uh with book map right knowing where supply and demand is and"
"5530180","5539010"," then uh my watch es s s p x and spy"
"5539010","5548920"," uh with velocity down below here and then um this is an hourly trigger"
"5548920","5557900"," five-minute trigger one-minute trigger white red weekly monthly and daily trigger daily trigger"
"5557900","5564640"," right now is way lower it's down here at four oh five ninety and i check these against uh all"
"5564640","5570500"," es as well i don't do that on streamle as much but i will check on es and see if"
"5570500","5576040"," there's anything i need to see points of resistance how high are we can go for each testing new"
"5576040","5581660"," highs there's a 30-minute chart and i also like uh one last thing i tell you blade is that"
"5581660","5591380"," um i like to trade off of uh the stock market clock so i will trade"

"5611600","5616960"," minutes or bulls have the next 15 minutes if i say we're at the top of the hour and it's"
"5616960","5625800"," 10 30 that's the top of the hour and so i'm looking on multi-time frames uh on an hour"
"5625800","5635360"," a 15-minute a five-minute one-minute a daily to look to see if velocity is on the side"
"5635360","5639780"," of the bulls or velocity is on the side of the bears i mean i'm using the bulls and bears"
"5639780","5648440"," like a um like a um like wrestling like a heel like i know that there's no real bulls and"

"5677560","5685820"," off um as you i'm assuming that you know that i'm on uh different time frames you can actually see"
"5686480","5694500"," if um bulls are or by side is losing velocity to the upside let's see look look look lower for"
"5694500","5699720"," smart money to buy back in and stuff like that i don't talk a lot about this i got a"

"9924270","9934060"," on tesla er but i'm not bullish on tesla well someone asked earlier"
"9934060","9941120"," about re-pricing of options for tesla it's not just tesla it's every event right every er uh do i"
"9941120","9949500"," see tesla uh hitting your targets up or down by open tomorrow probably not probably not uh unless"
"9949500","9957960"," there's something unknown that is when hey binkagee i love you man so much time you guys about uh"
"9957960","9965760"," event ball and stuff like that real quick so unless they do something that's really unknown i don't"
"9965760","9976740"," think that the trade on teslas until after they report now how that event ball doesn't go away is"
"9976740","9982600"," unknown news major and for tesla specifically if you're a tesla bull out there listening right now"
"9983320","9990820"," i gotta fucking tell you something i've been a tesla bull for a long fucking time they must deliver"
"9990820","9999400"," something new that goes for any company out there not promising especially them specifically"
"9999400","10006980"," not making a promise not delivering after a decade strike one you get the deck you got the decade"
"10006980","10016120"," that was priced in the tesla already number two delivery of something fucking new"
"10016120","10027650"," that is tangible to make people excited of what you've already promised number two and you haven't"
"10027650","10033310"," done any of that and i don't expect that to happen tomorrow it could be a stock split i don't"
"10033310","10039190"," think we're split the stock right now so you don't have that going for you like you need some shit"
"10039190","10047310"," like uh behind a closed door we didn't tell anybody we've made people promise uh not to go public"
"10047310","10048790"," and say and by the way we did"
"10048790","10057430"," we"
"10061460","10070840"," just uh 50,000 suvs we didn't tell anybody we're taking orders tomorrow and you can have delivery"
"10070840","10080760"," by the end of the week that'll move the fucking stock uh so outside of some shit like that"
"10080760","10087980"," happening you can fight rainbows all day long nobody gives a shit that doesn't mean the stock"
"10087980","10092880"," doesn't go up over time like next week or something my point here is you're expecting that"
"10092880","10097480"," explosive move to the side uh i don't see it it could be there but it's a it's a dark"
"10097480","10107820"," horse it's like it's like not your best chance that you're going to get the move that sticks uh"
"10107820","10113200"," for long so my recommendation is who does that shit up for the end of the day enter tomorrow or"
"10113200","10119160"," that's for me at least because what i'll do is if they hit the top and bottom targets then they"
"10119160","10123120"," actually do make a move higher in a week or two i can get into that trade in three days"
"10123120","10130600"," and make a lot of money with you guys uh or you know you could have a spread out there"
"10130600","10135660"," if you're still bullish i can see you being bullish never going up but the dealers are so dealers"
"10135660","10140340"," are going to counter that trade against you if we hit the high side the dealers are going to take"
"10140340","10148600"," the counter trade and it's going to go down now if there's some unknown news that's positive the"
"10148600","10153200"," dealer won't take the counter trade because they'll get run over and they always have to be delt"
"10153200","10162940"," neutral or chase so the chase is when they when we trade outside of the expected range and"
"10162940","10167980"," they actually follow you in the trade if you're buying a shit ton of calls and the market's getting"
"10167980","10174400"," overrun with calls they have to get in with you in the call side until you stop buying calls and"
"10176540","10184000"," even then i've been in every tesla trade that has gone to the moon and an er every single one"
"10184000","10189980"," of them at to date to date any one of them that has ripped faces off i've been in long"
"10189980","10198920"," the next day you usually get another chance to jump in still i watch my options print massively"
"10198920","10203680"," and then right at the open there's a there's a golden moment where you can jump right back in and"
"10203680","10213100"," ride that same train uh so where you're trading alongside dealers trying to stay on with with uh"
"10213100","10223080"," fomo call buyers so i don't maybe"
"10223080","10232920"," in the chat you tell me i'd love to know if you're a tesla bull what you think what news"
"10232920","10239600"," would need to drop or no i don't know if i'm more than this right you think if you think"
"10239600","10246500"," that tesla stock moves overnight maintains that price on the open and just keeps moving for two"
"10246500","10253020"," three days a week tell me what you think the news would have to be for that to happen i"
"10263420","10268820"," don't think profits are good enough i think they're good enough for the implied move i think like a"
"10268820","10276000"," good earnings report is good for the stock and it'll go up but i'm talking about dealers and i'm"
"10276000","10284460"," talking about um uh expectations for a company that's promised so much you got to understand i'm a"
"10284460","10293700"," tesla bull but you have to not test the queue i'm a realist tesla investor and um maybe you're just"
"10293700","10298680"," long the stock and then you take your profit in the morning or at the end of today before our"
"10298680","10306760"," market hours is over i'm not anti that when we even saw what netflix did right netflix reprised"
"10306760","10315740"," higher right so there's a chance to get both sides of that trade through through stock"
"10315740","10328580"," yet to"
"10328580","10332800"," discuss it in the in the chat i'm hoping to anything you have to say i've been through a lot"

"10357940","10365060"," beta stock and so for that move that you're looking for the one that you're talking about out there"
"10365060","10373640"," like we're gonna go to the moon it needs to it needs to run over a bunch of shorts it"
