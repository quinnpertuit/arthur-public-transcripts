"hS3y69sGdsg","7080","9440"," I think I'm just having some connectivity issues."
"hS3y69sGdsg","14080","15180"," Let's see if you guys are here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","15180","31180"," And we will go to Twitter."

"hS3y69sGdsg","64980","71980"," is the link to you tonight's."
"hS3y69sGdsg","94980","111380"," All right, so this one should be good."
"hS3y69sGdsg","111380","114300"," See if anybody's here right now."
"hS3y69sGdsg","114300","118660"," All right, looks like we've got a bunch of you in here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","118660","122140"," I can see 29 of you are watching right now."
"hS3y69sGdsg","122140","127140"," Can you guys hear me?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","127140","130540"," Let me know if you guys can hear me."
"hS3y69sGdsg","130540","132540"," Annless, I'm doing great, man."
"hS3y69sGdsg","132540","133540"," How are you?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","133540","142260"," It was a wild day today again, you know, of course leading up to today, there's stress."
"hS3y69sGdsg","142260","145540"," I think there's stress if you're a bull, a bear, I don't think it really matters."
"hS3y69sGdsg","145540","151660"," I think either side that you're on, there was a lot of stress today for everybody."
"hS3y69sGdsg","151660","152660"," Anthony Chavez."
"hS3y69sGdsg","152660","155460"," Hey, how are you doing, Anthony?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","155460","158380"," J who, that's my dog outside barking."
"hS3y69sGdsg","158380","165820"," I asked my wife and children to put the dogs away, but they didn't, so it's all right."
"hS3y69sGdsg","165820","166820"," Ryan, how are you?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","166820","170340"," Good evening, bed, good evening."
"hS3y69sGdsg","170340","176700"," Rohn, Fraun, Tro, Alpine, how are you doing, men, or a woman, or whoever you are?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","176700","177940"," Adam, how are you?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","177940","181940"," Chaz, good to see you, my brother."
"hS3y69sGdsg","181940","185980"," This is the first one that gave me a direct notification from YouTube for your information"
"hS3y69sGdsg","185980","187660"," right now, right on."
"hS3y69sGdsg","187660","194620"," Evening cap, that 470 call was beautiful this afternoon, boy, you know what, we, I bought"
"hS3y69sGdsg","194620","199100"," that clothes on Tuesday at the close at four o'clock."
"hS3y69sGdsg","199180","203500"," I think I posted it with enough time for anyone to grab them to, I think I posted it"
"hS3y69sGdsg","203500","205340"," right at four p.m."
"hS3y69sGdsg","205340","212900"," If you had held that call into, if you had held that call into today, the market went"
"hS3y69sGdsg","212900","215780"," down, but the call went up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","215780","221420"," So you could, and I posted about this earlier about call premium to watch call premium"
"hS3y69sGdsg","221420","229300"," today, because if you had known what the call, the pricing of calls yesterday at the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","229300","234980"," close, what they were, and then this morning, what it was interesting because it didn't"
"hS3y69sGdsg","234980","235980"," show up and flow."
"hS3y69sGdsg","235980","241900"," There was no flow showing up today showing that the banks were buying long in the market."
"hS3y69sGdsg","241900","247420"," They were very stealthy all day long, and the only way that I could tell that they were"
"hS3y69sGdsg","247420","249980"," going long was the call premium."
"hS3y69sGdsg","249980","257180"," It was going up, even though the market was going down, which inferred, of course, that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","257180","258180"," people were taking the market long."
"hS3y69sGdsg","258180","261260"," And when I say people, it's not us retail."
"hS3y69sGdsg","261260","266260"," We don't have that kind of power in the, in the market, but banks do."
"hS3y69sGdsg","266260","271900"," Hey, Elram, how are you?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","271900","273340"," Adam, what's up?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","273340","274340"," Jess, yo."
"hS3y69sGdsg","274340","275340"," Hey, Joe."
"hS3y69sGdsg","275340","276340"," Thanks for showing up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","276340","277340"," My brother."
"hS3y69sGdsg","277340","278340"," Good to see you."
"hS3y69sGdsg","278340","279340"," James."
"hS3y69sGdsg","279340","280340"," Thanks."
"hS3y69sGdsg","280340","281340"," Explorement."
"hS3y69sGdsg","281340","282340"," Matthew."
"hS3y69sGdsg","282340","283340"," Denny."
"hS3y69sGdsg","283340","285380"," What's up, my brother?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","285380","286380"," Yep."
"hS3y69sGdsg","286380","287380"," Cyber Dave."
"hS3y69sGdsg","287380","288380"," How are you, Cyber Dave?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","288380","289380"," Hey, Adam."
"hS3y69sGdsg","289380","290380"," How are you?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","290380","297180"," Yeah, we ended up so, so we started making the call last night before, or let's say Tuesday"
"hS3y69sGdsg","297180","303780"," before the close, right, to go long, and then we, some of some of you guys had followed"
"hS3y69sGdsg","303780","310300"," on that trade, and knew already as we were heading into the 1.30, 1 o'clock hour or"
"hS3y69sGdsg","310300","311300"," so."
"hS3y69sGdsg","311300","316980"," They were, they just kept going up in premium that I was, I think at 1.0 is up 30%."
"hS3y69sGdsg","316980","321300"," Even while it was that last little dip, it just held value, it didn't go away."
"hS3y69sGdsg","321300","324820"," So you just knew that you knew what was going on."
"hS3y69sGdsg","324820","326500"," You knew we were going up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","326500","331580"," And I ended up cutting those calls and I rebot calls two or three times, then added more to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","331580","332580"," my calls."
"hS3y69sGdsg","332580","333580"," We'll go into that later."
"hS3y69sGdsg","333580","334580"," Hey, Joe."
"hS3y69sGdsg","334580","335580"," Hey, Devin."
"hS3y69sGdsg","335580","337740"," It was a great day today, wasn't it?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","337740","339500"," I mean, yeah, I'm doing great, Josh."
"hS3y69sGdsg","339500","340500"," I'm doing great."
"hS3y69sGdsg","340500","341500"," It was a great day."
"hS3y69sGdsg","341500","342700"," You know, I was really stressed out."
"hS3y69sGdsg","342700","348820"," It was weird because before we get started, you know, let's talk briefly about, let's talk"
"hS3y69sGdsg","348820","353540"," briefly about this week, what the lead up to today."
"hS3y69sGdsg","353540","354540"," I was stressed."
"hS3y69sGdsg","354540","357260"," I don't know how you guys were, but I was, I was pretty stressed."
"hS3y69sGdsg","357260","360220"," The move, the move into today was stressful."
"hS3y69sGdsg","361220","369900"," There's so much noise out there in social media, inside discords, we watch CNBC, I mean,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","369900","374100"," they pretty much put out a, they put out some sort of a news."
"hS3y69sGdsg","374100","378180"," I should have brought it up, but there's some, they put out a post yesterday, CNBC did"
"hS3y69sGdsg","378180","379180"," at the end of the day."
"hS3y69sGdsg","379180","381540"," And it read like the end of the world."
"hS3y69sGdsg","381540","382740"," It was, it was terrible."
"hS3y69sGdsg","382740","388380"," And I thought to myself yesterday, if we know all this bad news, what, what worse could"
"hS3y69sGdsg","388380","389940"," they say to dump this market?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","389940","394260"," I mean, it would have to be, it would have to be horrific for what is known or what was"
"hS3y69sGdsg","394260","395260"," expected."
"hS3y69sGdsg","395260","396260"," Yeah."
"hS3y69sGdsg","396260","397260"," Epic day."
"hS3y69sGdsg","397260","398260"," Hi, William."
"hS3y69sGdsg","398260","399260"," Ritesh."
"hS3y69sGdsg","399260","400260"," Yeah."
"hS3y69sGdsg","400260","401740"," This, this day turned out to be outstanding."
"hS3y69sGdsg","401740","407980"," And you know what's interesting is the last, the last FOMC was very similar."
"hS3y69sGdsg","407980","412100"," Matter of fact, past few FOMCs have been like this, where we sell down, we sell out of"
"hS3y69sGdsg","412100","417340"," the market and we get very stressed into the day of FOMC and it becomes a nothing burger."
"hS3y69sGdsg","417820","423220"," Those, those original calls last time at the end, I think we ended up going up for three"
"hS3y69sGdsg","423220","425620"," straight days that thereafter."
"hS3y69sGdsg","425620","431420"," And those calls were worth four or five, I think in the high end, they were like 5000%"
"hS3y69sGdsg","431420","432740"," when they were all said and done."
"hS3y69sGdsg","432740","439140"," They were like 10 or 15 cents and they ended, oh boy, I forget, I'm going to have to go"
"hS3y69sGdsg","439140","440140"," back and look."
"hS3y69sGdsg","440140","443700"," It might have been like $9, may have been higher, may have been $20."
"hS3y69sGdsg","443700","445540"," It was, it was really insane."
"hS3y69sGdsg","445620","450860"," I think that those same calls from Tuesday will wind up the same way."
"hS3y69sGdsg","450860","452820"," I'm almost positive that they will."
"hS3y69sGdsg","452820","454820"," I'm pretty close."
"hS3y69sGdsg","454820","458500"," Yeah, they are, Josh, they're so extreme."
"hS3y69sGdsg","458500","462060"," You know, it's weird too, because I'm reading, I'm reading all these stories and you know,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","462060","465940"," it clouds your vision, clouds, what you're doing."
"hS3y69sGdsg","465940","469860"," And there is a point where you trade the market that's in front of you, that you have to put"
"hS3y69sGdsg","469860","474900"," the blinders on, you have to have done your, your research, your due diligence."
"hS3y69sGdsg","474900","477860"," And you trade what's in front of you."
"hS3y69sGdsg","477860","481580"," If you're, I talked to you guys about if you're a long investor and you don't want to sell"
"hS3y69sGdsg","481580","483380"," the market, I understand that."
"hS3y69sGdsg","483380","489460"," So you're shifting to that hedge position, to hedge, to hedge your, your lungs in this"
"hS3y69sGdsg","489460","490460"," market."
"hS3y69sGdsg","490460","497260"," If you were cash, how to play the market with a straddle, or if you were short to be able"
"hS3y69sGdsg","497260","502660"," to hedge long, right, that you had, you have to hedge yourself long with cheap calls."
"hS3y69sGdsg","502740","509820"," So you have to be able to pivot with the market pivots, but you're also looking for indicators"
"hS3y69sGdsg","509820","511420"," of where we're going."
"hS3y69sGdsg","511420","514540"," So we're going to get started real quick, okay?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","514540","517500"," I'm trying to, I'm trying to get this done for you guys real quick."
"hS3y69sGdsg","517500","519020"," What I'll do is how we'll do this is this."
"hS3y69sGdsg","519020","521340"," We're going to do a quick recap."
"hS3y69sGdsg","521340","524340"," We are going to talk about the economic calendar."
"hS3y69sGdsg","524340","526460"," We'll look at futures real quick."
"hS3y69sGdsg","526460","527860"," We'll look at the economic calendar."
"hS3y69sGdsg","527860","530340"," And then we're going to get right into the three indexes."
"hS3y69sGdsg","530340","531980"," We'll do the S&P 500."
"hS3y69sGdsg","531980","535180"," Q's and the IWM."
"hS3y69sGdsg","535180","539620"," And then we're, if any of you want to stick around later in the stream, if we have some"
"hS3y69sGdsg","539620","543820"," time and you want some tickers called out, I'm more than, if I have the time and you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","543820","547980"," guys have the time and you're more than willing to stick around, we'll try to do some charting."
"hS3y69sGdsg","547980","552620"," So you guys can see how I chart, how I look for buy-ins, that kind of stuff."
"hS3y69sGdsg","552620","553620"," When do I buy?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","553620","554620"," Whatever."
"hS3y69sGdsg","554620","556180"," If you guys want to stick around for that, you can."
"hS3y69sGdsg","556180","562340"," So just right off the bat, if you haven't, I have made videos in the past."
"hS3y69sGdsg","562340","569220"," I'm going to do a video series on how I trade so that you can take sort of a class."
"hS3y69sGdsg","569220","572860"," It's free and so you can see where I'm coming from."
"hS3y69sGdsg","572860","577340"," But a lot of my previous videos gives the basic background of how I trade."
"hS3y69sGdsg","577340","582500"," And I frequently, so this is the ES chart as the mini."
"hS3y69sGdsg","582500","587820"," And you know, since 2007, 2009, this has pretty much worked."
"hS3y69sGdsg","587820","593420"," We've had temper tantrums in the past, but the market generally goes up, especially the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","593420","594420"," S&P 500."
"hS3y69sGdsg","594420","595820"," You guys should know this."
"hS3y69sGdsg","595820","601940"," I always recommend to new traders to learn how to trade the S&P 500 and some, one of"
"hS3y69sGdsg","601940","609540"," the instruments that could be the SPX, the Spy ES, you pick it, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","609540","612740"," But this is, you'll also hear people, you know, there's another thing I want to talk"
"hS3y69sGdsg","612740","613740"," to you guys about."
"hS3y69sGdsg","613740","614740"," Okay."
"hS3y69sGdsg","614740","615740"," This is important."
"hS3y69sGdsg","615740","622500"," And that is, last couple weeks, a lot of stock bulls were getting whacked in the market."
"hS3y69sGdsg","622500","627540"," And there were less and less safe havens as we moved forward."
"hS3y69sGdsg","627540","632060"," There were a lot of index bears that weren't getting what they wanted out of the Spy."
"hS3y69sGdsg","632060","634580"," They wanted the Spy to drop more."
"hS3y69sGdsg","634580","640140"," And you'll oftentimes you'll hear snide remarks on social media saying, you know, trading"
"hS3y69sGdsg","640140","647260"," the Spy is for new traders or unintelligent traders."
"hS3y69sGdsg","647260","651540"," If the smart people trade VICs or they trade netty gas or they trade foreign currencies,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","651540","653180"," that kind of shit, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","653180","657660"," And I'll be honest, at the end of the day, I really don't care what other people are"
"hS3y69sGdsg","657660","659060"," doing out there."
"hS3y69sGdsg","659060","665260"," The only thing that I know about is that after trading successfully for long enough"
"hS3y69sGdsg","665260","670940"," where I haven't blown myself, I count up to where I have to have a job or I can't do"
"hS3y69sGdsg","670940","675460"," this any longer, I realize that I want to trade for a living."
"hS3y69sGdsg","675460","680900"," I know that I want to be able to make enough money the easy way."
"hS3y69sGdsg","680900","683660"," So I don't want to trade hard."
"hS3y69sGdsg","683660","687780"," So it's, if that's the easiest index for me to make a check, you know, at the end of"
"hS3y69sGdsg","687780","691260"," the day, oh, thank you so much for the coffee."
"hS3y69sGdsg","691260","694300"," I just got a cup of coffee, it's pretty awesome."
"hS3y69sGdsg","694300","697660"," So but at the end of the day, at the end of the day, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","697660","703060"," So at the end of the day, if the Spy is the easiest index or stock to trade, then that's"
"hS3y69sGdsg","703060","704420"," what I'm going to trade."
"hS3y69sGdsg","704420","706660"," And I've become intimate with it and familiar with it."
"hS3y69sGdsg","706660","709260"," It makes me a lot of money."
"hS3y69sGdsg","709260","711300"," And then I've learned other indexes."
"hS3y69sGdsg","711300","713700"," I've learned how to trade the NASDAQ."
"hS3y69sGdsg","713700","718380"," Every time I've learned how to trade small caps and then I've branched out and learned"
"hS3y69sGdsg","718380","722700"," how to trade individual tickers and I spent a lot of time on one ticker, I'll trade Tesla"
"hS3y69sGdsg","722700","728420"," for years, I'll trade Apple for years, I start to learn other tickers so that let's say Spy"
"hS3y69sGdsg","728420","734300"," is not moving one day, I can switch over to a Tesla or an Apple or whatever."
"hS3y69sGdsg","734300","737780"," But your base is always, should always be an index."
"hS3y69sGdsg","737780","746540"," It should preferably be the Spy or the ES or some, one of those, one of the derivatives"
"hS3y69sGdsg","746540","747540"," of the S&P 500."
"hS3y69sGdsg","747540","752580"," And the reason for that, of course, because it's predictable, it's consistent, it's our"
"hS3y69sGdsg","752580","755220"," market's health, you guys know that, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","755220","757540"," So this year, let's take a look real quick."
"hS3y69sGdsg","757540","761660"," This year, had you bought all these bottoms down here, we can even raise this up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","761660","765220"," Had you bought all these bottoms down here, we'll go a little bit higher."
"hS3y69sGdsg","766220","770300"," Let's pretend this is earlier in the year."
"hS3y69sGdsg","770300","772980"," If you had bought any of these tags down below, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","772980","776740"," If you just turned your computer off this year, you would have made money how many times?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","776740","785700"," One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 times this year."
"hS3y69sGdsg","785700","789220"," You would have had a perfect record this entire year."
"hS3y69sGdsg","789220","795180"," And had you bought calls on these hits, right, once we tagged or went below, had you put"
"hS3y69sGdsg","795180","800180"," one to three months on them, you'd still have have printed, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","800180","804340"," If they were in the money, let's say you tagged here and you put Justin in the money call"
"hS3y69sGdsg","804340","809260"," up that was three months out, you still would have made your money back right here, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","809260","814860"," So, and then we talk often these videos I've made about how far are you exposing yourself?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","814860","817500"," I always talk about no more than 10%."
"hS3y69sGdsg","817500","819260"," Some people like to go up to 30%."
"hS3y69sGdsg","819260","824940"," Even if you were to go to 10% and your exposure, and let's say we have a market crash, you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","824940","829020"," should never be blowing your accounts up that way, does that make sense?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","829020","833860"," If you go, let's say you leave it as deep as 30%, and you've had two so far chances"
"hS3y69sGdsg","833860","838340"," down here to really get banged up or down here, you're still not blowing your accounts"
"hS3y69sGdsg","838340","839340"," up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","839340","842300"," So, when you hear people say, I blew my account up, when they say, you know, it's a really"
"hS3y69sGdsg","842300","846620"," rough week and I'm down to like the last of my money or whatever, you have to start to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","846620","850820"," plan or structure how you're trading, the risk that you're associating with your trading."
"hS3y69sGdsg","851140","856500"," When I talk about leaning into a dip, I talk to you guys about how like my first buy in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","856500","860540"," down here, when we even back here, when we first hit down here, let's say, I'll put my"
"hS3y69sGdsg","860540","867540"," first trades in, and they are usually three month out spreads in the money, maybe even"
"hS3y69sGdsg","867540","868780"," slightly below the money."
"hS3y69sGdsg","868780","873660"," And as I start to add to those trades, I'll get more aggressive and more risky as we"
"hS3y69sGdsg","873660","874660"," go down."
"hS3y69sGdsg","874660","878780"," So, as we start to come deeper and deeper and deeper down here, you know, even if even"
"hS3y69sGdsg","878780","882380"," if the market's rolling over, you know, there's going to be at some point a recovery"
"hS3y69sGdsg","882380","883460"," rally."
"hS3y69sGdsg","883460","887740"," And if I get more aggressive, I'm going to make more profit than I would on the safer"
"hS3y69sGdsg","887740","889860"," bets before, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","889860","893660"," So, I'm going to make a series about this for you guys, but anyways, that's my point"
"hS3y69sGdsg","893660","894660"," here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","894660","897860"," And you can see that we're much lower, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","897860","901420"," So we're trading lower than our normal trading channel."
"hS3y69sGdsg","901420","904980"," And you'll see guys drawing new trading channels for the spy right now."
"hS3y69sGdsg","904980","906820"," I'm not really concerned with that at the moment."
"hS3y69sGdsg","906820","911500"," I just want you to see where we are overall in the market."
"hS3y69sGdsg","911500","915940"," So we're going to take this down."
"hS3y69sGdsg","915940","916940"," Hold on."
"hS3y69sGdsg","916940","917940"," Two."
"hS3y69sGdsg","917940","918940"," Sorry."
"hS3y69sGdsg","918940","919940"," I just sneezed."
"hS3y69sGdsg","919940","925540"," We're going to take that this down to a lower level here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","925540","926780"," And we ended up higher on the day."
"hS3y69sGdsg","926780","930180"," I think we closed 1.5, 4% higher."
"hS3y69sGdsg","930180","934940"," That was a much, much, much wider range than our implied move that we were supposed to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","934940","936780"," make today."
"hS3y69sGdsg","936780","939660"," We also know that the FMC was today, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","939660","944020"," It was announced that they were going to speed up the taper and the bond buying as well."
"hS3y69sGdsg","944020","947380"," They were going to hike rates in 2022."
"hS3y69sGdsg","947380","949860"," We knew that was happening, but it was all kind of expected."
"hS3y69sGdsg","949860","952820"," So we ended up selling down the volatility in the market."
"hS3y69sGdsg","952820","955180"," You can see the market grabbed a bid today."
"hS3y69sGdsg","955180","959580"," I want to say today's bid, just in the spy alone, it was 70 million shares or something"
"hS3y69sGdsg","959580","962060"," like that."
"hS3y69sGdsg","962060","965420"," And that was great to see."
"hS3y69sGdsg","965420","968740"," Now we have nothing on the, so this is futures right now, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","968740","969740"," We're looking decent."
"hS3y69sGdsg","969740","972540"," You can see that the trade I posted on Twitter earlier."
"hS3y69sGdsg","972540","977500"," You can see that the trade today was in small caps to close the day out with small caps"
"hS3y69sGdsg","977500","980220"," were beaten down so hard."
"hS3y69sGdsg","980220","987460"," And there were companies, there were hedge funds yesterday that were forced into hedging"
"hS3y69sGdsg","987460","989860"," at the absolute bottom worst time."
"hS3y69sGdsg","989860","991220"," They ended up hedging."
"hS3y69sGdsg","991220","995940"," They had paid full dollar price, four puts at some point yesterday afternoon."
"hS3y69sGdsg","995940","998980"," I posted that on Twitter as well."
"hS3y69sGdsg","998980","1003020"," So the trade most definitely was in small caps to close the night out."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1003020","1006180"," I'm going to show you some volume profile stuff here in just a minute."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1006180","1007940"," And tomorrow we've got nothing on the schedule."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1007940","1013100"," I want you all to be aware for the next two weeks or next two to three weeks."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1013100","1015060"," We have short weeks, okay?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1015060","1018500"," So we have some important, we've got some important numbers on Thursday."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1018500","1021900"," You might find a little bit of weakness in the market, possibly on Wednesday a little"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1021900","1022900"," bit."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1022900","1027340"," But in all honesty, the thing you're looking at is that Friday, we've got, we were closed"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1027340","1030060"," on Friday on the 24th, fourth."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1030060","1032340"," And then the following week we roll right into New Year's."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1032340","1036500"," So we have short weeks that we're trading from now into the 31st."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1036500","1040700"," Typically around this time of year, you won't see too much activity in the market."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1040700","1046100"," You're going to see the market quiet down as we head into the rest of the month."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1046100","1048300"," You're going to see the participants weighing off."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1048300","1052780"," You're going to see, even on social media, you'll see the social media will slow down."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1052780","1056940"," You'll see the banks and the hedge funds, all your institutions, everyone's starting"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1056940","1058780"," to take their vacations."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1058780","1060900"," So I want you to be aware of that as we move forward."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1060900","1065740"," This is a really good time to find a low if we're going to continue to go up and buy"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1065740","1070820"," spreads because you can end up grinding towards the end of the year."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1070820","1074620"," And if you're, let's say you get stuck in this vortex where you're buying your day"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1074620","1076740"," trading FDs."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1076740","1081340"," It is very possible that they're worthless at the end of a day or the second day when"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1081340","1083700"," you head into a daily OPEX."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1083700","1088420"," So this is one of those times where it's nice to take some spreads on and have them print"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1088420","1090180"," for you end of month."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1090180","1095420"," So keep that on your plate as we chart this stuff out for you."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1095420","1100220"," And it should be like this into, so this is last week's, I should have gotten put the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1100220","1101220"," big counter up for you."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1101220","1106060"," But there really isn't much in the market right now heading into the end of the month."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1106060","1110020"," It's going to slow down even if we continue to go up and that's, this is that environment."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1110020","1116700"," You have low, low volume days that'll come and retail bulls will take over usually and"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1116700","1120620"," push this market to all time highs."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1120620","1124300"," So next we're going to go back to the ES over here and I'm going to start giving you guys"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1124300","1125500"," some numbers here for a minute."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1125500","1128460"," We're going to, we're going to chart in some support and resistance numbers."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1128460","1134100"," I want you to be aware of where the volatility where the negative and positive gamma is in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1134100","1140900"," the market coming into, let's see if I can get some numbers here for you."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1140900","1145740"," I already typed all these in and, okay."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1145740","1154220"," So ES, the key, the volatility trigger that you need to be aware of this week is 4628."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1154220","1157260"," So we're going to put some lineage in here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1157260","1167320"," So 4628, I want you guys to be aware of this number here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1167320","1173940"," That we're in the way, we're in the way, we wait, 4628."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1173940","1180780"," Is that, I guess we're a little bit lower than we should be."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1180780","1189140"," Let's see if I can get this up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1189140","1195660"," So right here, this is where negative gamma is, this is where positive gamma is."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1195660","1200340"," So if we're up above here, I want you to start making your assumptions that we're trading"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1200340","1201340"," higher."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1201340","1206340"," I want you to understand that, that this is negative gamma, this is positive gamma."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1206340","1209220"," As long as we're up here, we should be trading up."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1209220","1212660"," You see how we traded down, bounced, and came above again."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1212660","1216380"," This is as long as we're up here, we're in that positive state of mind."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1216380","1218300"," Be aware of that, okay?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1218300","1223620"," This is your by the F and dip number down here, 4628."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1223620","1225380"," We defend this line down here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1225380","1230740"," If we break lower, you should be switching to be bearish, very bearish."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1230740","1233820"," This is like the bulls, or this is the bear's world down here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1233820","1235900"," They own this down here, okay?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1235900","1237420"," So be conscious of that."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1237420","1243300"," This is your big by the dip number down below 4628, and we have some large gamma inside"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1243300","1251900"," of 4638, 4663, and 4688, but you can see that we jumped above all of that today."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1251900","1256020"," You saw that in today's action, so we're going to put some other numbers in here."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1256020","1258620"," So we're going to look for some resistance levels above."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1258620","1269700"," The first one that we're going to put in, let's see here, 4713, right here, okay?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1269700","1273420"," So you see our first resistance level is right in the overnight."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1273420","1280260"," We'll bring this down even closer, and you can start to see that we bounced right off"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1280260","1284300"," this in the middle of the night, so we can get this back."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1285300","1291220"," You can see that we bounced behind back here, right, and this right here is a large support"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1291220","1292220"," area 4628."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1292220","1299980"," I'm going to switch over and show you on the ES chart what I'm talking about with this,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1299980","1301300"," okay?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1301300","1307420"," And you can see, we have a long way to fall, right?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1307420","1309820"," You see this nice burg that we have here?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1309820","1314660"," You see this point of control here, 468638."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1314660","1319100"," So you're going to be looking for the morning, you're going to be, let's say we open up the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1319100","1323980"," morning tomorrow, and we do have a big red candle, you're going to be looking for a bounce"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1323980","1332180"," off of 4686.38, okay, 468638."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1332180","1337460"," So we're going to go back to our chart here, and you can see it right down here, right,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1337460","1338460"," 4628."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1338460","1347860"," So we'll raise that up slightly, 4628, right there."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1347860","1351500"," And this would also, this would be a nice place for us to come back down."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1351500","1356220"," If you have a question of where do I think we're opening tomorrow, I think we open above"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1356220","1357420"," 4713."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1357420","1361100"," So if you're a bull out there and you're watching this right now, I can't see what you guys"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1361100","1367020"," are typing right now, but I think we open above 4713, that will become new support, and I'm"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1367020","1375340"," going to now give you some targets, okay, as we head into, let's see if I can get this,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1375340","1382980"," I'm going to give you guys some legit price targets right now, that you guys are going"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1382980","1386860"," to want to be looking for as we move forward, all right."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1386860","1396060"," So we've got 4713, next one would be 4738."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1396060","1398940"," This one's going to be minor."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1398940","1408580"," So make this smaller, I can even make that a dotted line, I guess, make some dash lines"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1408580","1409780"," for you, okay."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1409780","1423900"," So 4738.75, your next one is going to be 4765, right there."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1424900","1430620"," Yep, so 4765 would be your next point of resistance."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1430620","1444460"," And then 4793, let's put that one right there, kind of see these right here, and this is"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1444460","1449140"," where the good stuff is, okay, this is where the juice is, and you guys want to know where"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1449660","1462100"," what I'm hoping to have here, we're going to try to hit 4817, yep, there, that's going"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1462100","1467140"," to be my price target, you guys want to know where I think we're headed, where we're headed,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1467140","1473540"," oh, hold on, I don't like big dash lines for the top, right there."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1473540","1475300"," So that's really what you're looking for."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1475300","1479860"," So let's look at the S&P, you can pump these numbers, there's going to be slightly off"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1479860","1487220"," in the spy, I'll post on Twitter what the targets are going to be, you'll hear some"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1487220","1492900"," people say that we're going to do a half back, you will hear people say expect a half back"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1492900","1500940"," on, you'll have some people say that we'll half back down here somewhere to 4654, you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1500940","1504860"," could put some minor supports in here for tomorrow, I don't think we come back down"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1504860","1510220"," tomorrow, but it's possible, in all likelihood, we have anywhere from one to three days of"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1510220","1517020"," upward movement, that would include Thursday, if we move higher tomorrow, I would expect"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1517020","1522140"," Friday to be down, if we have weakness tomorrow, I would expect us to come straight back up,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1522140","1525420"," let's say we have some weakness tomorrow, and then we shoot up, that could happen as well,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1525420","1530060"," but let's look at, let's get some ideas in our head, let's start thinking about, you know,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1530060","1533260"," where do we go long here, right, you guys want to know where do I go long?"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1533820","1536620"," So I'm going to show you, show you where you're buying dips,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1542540","1544540"," show you guys where you want to be buying dips."
"hS3y69sGdsg","1549260","1553420"," So these, this is all your dip buying down here, you know you can be dip buying down here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1553420","1557020"," you know that there was some resistance above here twice, you can see it right,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1557020","1561660"," we had this previous resistance over here, right, you can see all this stuff,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1561740","1565820"," this is back on the 12th of December, you know that all-time highs, right,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1565820","1570780"," are right up here, you see this all-time highs number back here, so we'll make this one a little"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1570780","1577580"," bit, a little bit bigger resistance, that one's probably a big one, and we'll make it yellow,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1577580","1581740"," so you guys can be aware of it, you're going to hear bears say, we're not breaking this,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1581740","1587020"," but I'll tell you what, when we come back down, so we made this trip up, right, and we, this"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1587100","1592860"," was our all-time highs, we came back down, we attempted to break all-time highs and failed,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1592860","1597500"," we retested down below, this is like a look above, right, we looked above and we weren't ready,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1597500","1602860"," we came back down and we tested again and we weren't ready to go down on an FOMC meeting,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1603580","1609820"," so that implies that the move is up, we're in a bullish context, I think that we beat this,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1609820","1616380"," no problem, and so where do you buy the dip, well if you're given tomorrow morning any kind of a gift,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1617660","1623740"," any kind of a gift, tomorrow morning, or in this move up, and these levels down below here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1623740","1628940"," you take them and you take them long, okay, so the first attempt that we need to do tomorrow"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1628940","1634300"," would be to break through all-time highs, so my price target for tomorrow would be to break through"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1634300","1644060"," 4738.75 and find some support down over here tomorrow, maybe we trade down into Friday or Monday,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1644060","1649420"," or we might just keep legging it up straight up to 4817, that's my price target currently for"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1650700","1655820"," spy, the ES, whatever you want to call it, or whatever derivative you use, that's my price target"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1655820","1662540"," right now, 4817, now what would be the move heading into the beginning of the year, if we tag up here"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1662540","1669020"," at this 4817, you're going to want to see us pull back, so this would be what bears are looking for"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1669020","1673900"," to get real gnarly, right, bears want to see some form of a pullback back here, you know that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1673900","1679260"," we're going to have some support here at 4738, and you know we're going to have some support"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1679260","1686540"," into this area of 4713, you'll also notice that the call wall above will move higher once we get"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1686540","1692860"," up here, and the the put wall will raise from the bottom as well, so your bottoms aren't going to be"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1692860","1699980"," way down here at 4500 any longer, they'll raise up probably probably to this 4628, it's going to take"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1699980","1705100"," a week or so for this to move, but that will take, that should take place, all signs are"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1705100","1711580"," pointing towards this happening as we head into the upcoming weeks, now talking with you about"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1711580","1717260"," this at this point, you are going to hear people say we're going to be faked out, we're going to be"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1718620","1722540"," you know all kinds of shit you're going to hear from now into the end of the year, but in reality"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1722540","1728860"," our unless there's something that we don't know in the market, some unknown news event, this should"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1728940","1736060"," be the plan heading into end of year at this point, now if you are bearish, you can trade these"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1736060","1741740"," resistance points as we move up, if you want to get heavily bearish, I wouldn't be getting bearish"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1741740","1747980"," until 4815, if you're a bull and we get to 4800 and I find you on social media trying to tell me"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1747980","1753100"," that we're going higher, we might be, but why do I need that play, I don't need that risk in my life,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1753100","1759660"," I'll take this risk right here, I'll make bank, I'll spend the holidays with my family, if we"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1759660","1764620"," come back a little bit, pull back up here a little bit, I'll take another long there, but I want"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1764620","1770780"," you guys to understand that when you're trading the market, you always want to be longing bottoms"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1770780","1777180"," and you want to be selling tops, even on smaller timeframes okay, so you guys saw that we have here"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1777260","1783740"," on ES, you should be able to pause this video at some point and pump these numbers in okay,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1783740","1790780"," you can track this, these support resistance levels will change each day, you'll hear someone"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1790780","1794860"," say we're going to test the prior low down here, you'll hear somebody tell you that we're testing"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1795420","1800460"," 4598 tomorrow, don't listen to those people, I doubt that happens, I don't think we get that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1800460","1805420"," gift at this point, I don't think you do, the banks are in, they're never giving, the banks"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1805500","1810860"," are never going to let you buy in lower than they buy in, okay, so be aware of that as we move forward"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1810860","1817260"," for what day this is, we'll test previous days, lows and cash gaps as we move forward, but do I"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1817260","1824300"," think we're coming back down here, 5% chance, and we get down here, 4599, the chances of that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1824300","1832780"," happening are 5 to 10%, that low, that's how low it is, okay, let me check you guys real quick and"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1832860","1839100"," see what you guys are asking, so just right now, okay, if you guys have any questions on ES, let me"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1839100","1846140"," know, I wish tomorrow, LOL, we'll be looking for that morning flush, blood stunt, I knew you got"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1846140","1850460"," some of you guys would be out there saying they want the morning flush, it's a big morning flush too,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1850460","1856860"," no doubt about it, right, this is a big pullback, and if it was me, or if you're a bull, let's say"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1856860","1862540"," you're holding on, you want to see this move above between now and pre-market or the opening"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1862540","1867580"," bell, you want to see that, if you don't see that, you see some weakness and we bounce and"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1867580","1874540"," come lower, that is possible, so another thing I always tell people is it's okay to take profits,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1874540","1880940"," leave a few runners, it's always okay to find a dip and buy that dip too, okay, you guys don't"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1880940","1885500"," have to be heroes, you guys can take your money and run, you guys can take your money from today"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1885500","1889980"," and take the next two weeks off if you want to, and just wait for the next big buy-in, you know,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1890060","1893740"," you guys don't have to play every single move all the way to rejection,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1895660","1900300"," Adam, can I come over for Christmas, screenshot it, that's some healthy advice about the banks,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1900300","1907500"," yeah, you know what it is with the banks, I try to trade, I never try to trade with what retail"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1907500","1914140"," is thinking, I always try to trade like, hey, what would the banks do here, you know, where the banks"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1914140","1919020"," buy-in, where the banks selling, where do the banks get in, you know right now where the banks are in,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1919580","1925900"," right, you know the banks bought 4,600, so that's where they're in, so when do they want to sell,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1925900","1932460"," when do they want to take profit off that 4,600, we had 100 and what, was it 130 or 140 point"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1932460","1939500"," rip today, that is major, the banks could take their profit at the opening bell tomorrow and be"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1939500","1945420"," very happy, nice window dressing, wrap it up, we're done for the year, does quadwitching matter,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1945500","1954780"," yes it does, quadwitching does matter, oftentimes you're going to see some movements mostly in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1954780","1961820"," futures, you'll see some buying and selling, you'll hear people on the internet right now say things"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1961820","1967820"," to you like, we will be weak on Thursday, everyone thinks tomorrow's Friday, tomorrow is Thursday,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1968540","1972380"," they'll say we'll be weak on Thursday and strong on Friday, or they'll say we'll be strong on"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1972380","1979740"," Thursday, it'll be weak on Friday, oftentimes the Thursday before it opex and sometimes specifically,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1980620","1986380"," the trend still matters, sometimes you'll find some weakness in the open of Thursdays, but it'll"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1986380","1994300"," be one of our biggest days, so if you wanted to be safe tomorrow you could sell the opening bell,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","1994300","2000380"," collect your profit and look for some weakness in the morning, but if I were a bull I would be"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2000380","2005900"," buying that dip, I would not be getting bearish, I'd buy that dip because let's say we dip this deep"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2005900","2012140"," tomorrow, my expectation would be that we go straight to all time highs possibly by end of day"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2012140","2018860"," tomorrow, now if we hit this all time highs tomorrow, you will see you should see some weakness into"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2018860","2025900"," opex on Friday, they will try to pin where we are somewhere in this environment, if you have to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2025900","2033420"," remember that there were some people or there were a lot of banks in on iron condors and butterflies"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2033420","2043020"," this past couple weeks, I talked to you guys about, I posted somewhere about the great or the covid"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2043020","2048460"," trade rebalancing, let's look at the monthly, this is a better way to look at it,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2049260","2057740"," if you look here on this trade right here, see this area right here, there are a lot of iron condor, a lot of iron"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2057740","2063740"," butterflies and condors out there, broken butterflies out there right now, the banks have, but they are"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2063740","2069980"," going to want to print into opex on Friday, so my expectation is that we're going to move up,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2069980","2076620"," print all time highs, possibly come down into this area to print out the rest of those complex spreads"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2077100","2083420"," that professional traders have, can we go up here and never come back, never look back, possible,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2083420","2088940"," it's possible, I think they come up here, they print their short dated calls, we're going to have"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2089660","2094940"," a put roll up, we're going to have a gamma roll off, put gamma roll off that comes on the 17th,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2095580","2100860"," so that could make us go big on Monday as well, Monday should be a big day, and then we have"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2100860","2106700"," another big one on the 31st, and just so you all know, there's a couple things we have, there's"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2106700","2114220"," a couple things we have to talk about, there we were on the cusp or edge yesterday of creating"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2114220","2121020"," another, it's not reverb, it's called a, it's when a feedback, a feedback loop in the market,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2121740","2129900"," if the market fails to place farther dated calls into January, as we move to the end of December,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2130460","2137020"," it would set up this, see this wedge here, this expanding wedge, it could, in a technical sense,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2137020","2145020"," set us up for movements in January that are wild, wild swinging movements, sorry, hold on a minute,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2146860","2152300"," but that's unknown at this point, we have to see what the bid, we have to see the bid that comes"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2152300","2157420"," into the market over the next two weeks, if the bid in the market is all short dated calls,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2157500","2163180"," let's say we stop putting calls into January, we could start to see some wild swings beginning"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2163180","2169820"," of the year, the expectation though for right now is with the, with the put gamma rolling off,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2169820","2175580"," and we are looking like we're going to be strong into the second week at least of January, it does"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2175580","2183820"," look like this will begin to, to the, or the, the volatility should begin to collapse, it'll make"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2183820","2188460"," the market a little bit smoother, now there are some beers out there that are betting on that,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2188460","2192780"," you can see this wedge right here, right, they're betting on an expansion of this wedge where it"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2192780","2197580"," starts to get wild and out of hand, almost like you're shaking, let's say you were holding a drink"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2197580","2202060"," in your hand, and we're going up, but I'm shaking you as you're walking up a flight of stairs,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2202060","2207340"," they're expecting that at some point that shakeout will crash the market, so then that's still,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2207980","2213340"," it's, it's there, but it's not there right now, it's hard to explain in simple terms, there,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2213340","2219820"," we need to see what the, what happens with the call structure for January and February,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2221180","2227100"," see resonance, yep resonance, very positive gamma wouldn't they be roll off a positive gamma on"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2227100","2234700"," Friday, that's a good question, and I've seen that on discord, someone was trying to posit that as"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2234700","2244940"," well, you need to understand that it was so lopsided on the put side, all things were not equal,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2246220","2255260"," there was everyone was short, everyone, and I mean everyone was short, this gamma that's rolling off"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2255260","2263900"," on Friday is so big that it creates what's called a Vanna effect, right, and you're going,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2263900","2270860"," that same whiplash that took us down here, the way this took place, the violence of this move"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2270860","2277100"," down when you start to see these violent moves down, there will always, well there should be a"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2277100","2283820"," reaction to that, to that move, you see this violent move and you saw the same, the same reaction to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2283820","2290460"," it, well this is going to continue to take place and send us much, much higher, we are in a bullish"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2290460","2297020"," context, we are in a bullish market, the market always goes up, you must understand that, that is"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2297020","2303500"," the rule until it changes, so when you introduce negative gamma like we have into the market like"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2303500","2310380"," this, the reaction on a market that goes up is like a slingshot, be aware of that because you will"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2310380","2317180"," get, you will get, you will get burned, I promise you, okay, speaking of banks, what do you think,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2317180","2322540"," no, no, one more thing for you Chase is that's the point that I'm making about the call, you want"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2322540","2331260"," to see the calls continue to come into the market into January and we have some huge dates, some"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2331260","2337980"," huge dates coming up, so this trade should last into a minimum of mid-January, so you then want"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2337980","2343420"," to be looking from now into January into what is the call flow, what is the put flow, and there's a"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2343420","2347420"," big difference between put flow and hedge flow, that's the other thing I should tell you guys,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2348220","2354380"," this flow that's coming off, or this negative gamma that's coming off, this isn't normal puts,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2354380","2363100"," these are major, big, block hedging that comes into the market, okay, 3,000 puts, 3 million"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2363660","2368700"," puts, 300 million shares, longer term how much will the yield curve have an effect on the market,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2369580","2377180"," it's starting to flatten, but the tail risk is big, we have to, we don't have all the information"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2377180","2384700"," yet heading into January, I can't answer that question at the moment, there is some tail risk"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2384700","2390300"," coming up, white clause Friday, yep we got white clause Friday coming, it's going to be nasty,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2390300","2395260"," and I know some of you guys don't drink out there, so maybe we'll do like, next Friday we'll do just"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2395260","2401340"," carbonated soda water, something gross, and I'll, we'll shotgun some soda, we'll be water gang"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2401340","2410460"," for Friday, I'm going to try to get, some of you guys out there have tipped me for the work that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2410460","2414940"," I'm putting in here, and I really appreciate that, I'm going to try to get all of your names together,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2414940","2420460"," so when we do this video I can show you guys some proper appreciation, call your names out,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2420540","2425500"," stuff like that, I don't charge anybody, but I do appreciate the tips that helps me to pay for"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2425500","2430300"," the tools that I use, I think there's a link at the bottom, or inside the description of this"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2430300","2436380"," video, there's one pin to my handle, there's no requirement for you guys to pay me, it does"
"hS3y69sGdsg","2436380","2441580"," motivate me though, I didn't think it would have motivated me, but it is, it is definitely motivating"

"hS3y69sGdsg","3261900","3266940"," now Tesla's strong, they do great things, they actually produce things in, like when you put"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3266940","3274300"," Tesla up against a company that is just in office with a few engineers in it, let's say I've got"

"hS3y69sGdsg","3292940","3297900"," go places, because some of them are going to, but what I'm just going to say to you is that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3298620","3307580"," there is still some heavy hedging on these companies and not only that, you need to see"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3308540","3316140"," these long only hedge funds rebuy back into these companies as we head into the new year,"

"hS3y69sGdsg","3381500","3386940"," there's more money to be made on the way up in those crashes, those moments where we have a"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3386940","3391580"," recovery or a rally, there's more money to be made there because everybody knows we're going"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3391580","3399180"," down, everybody's short in those moments, so our market does go up until it doesn't work any longer,"

"hS3y69sGdsg","3488700","3497420"," so today, or I want you to realize that the biggest beatdown was in small caps,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3498380","3505420"," and the volume today was in Sano, I don't have it right here, it's not showing my volume here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3505420","3513820"," but at the end of the day today, there was a huge buy-in on the Russell, and you can see in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3513820","3520620"," futures right now, the Russell is up like 50, 60 percent or something, this was the trade you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3520620","3529900"," really wanted at the bell on the close today, because of the potential move that the Russell"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3529900","3536620"," can make, and in all honesty, because of this huge swing and the Vanna rally that will probably"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3536620","3541820"," take place here in the rut, in the rut, and this is what I was talking to you about a moment to go"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3541820","3548860"," with, speculative growth stocks, if you see them catch that bid, the market should be fine into"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3548860","3555100"," beginning of the year, if you do not see that bid, go in, let's say you see this rally fail in the"

"hS3y69sGdsg","3561020","3567980"," you're a bull, you want to see the Russell recover, if you're a bear, you want to see the Russell fail,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3568540","3573980"," if you see a failure in the Russell, that is pointing towards some down months in leading into"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3573980","3577900"," springtime, okay, this is going to be your indicator that you're going to be looking for"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3578380","3585020"," into into springtime weakness or or positive flow, okay, you guys got that? Yep, old rusty,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3585660","3592220"," old, and I actually hate the Russell, but I, but I will trade the Russell up too, okay, I will trade"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3592220","3597820"," the Russell up, I love trading the Russell too, another thing about the Russell is you want to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3597820","3604940"," think about it more on a weekly basis than a daily basis, you don't want to be trading the Russell"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3604940","3609900"," with timelines that are zero dates, you can, but you shouldn't, you should trade the Russell"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3609900","3616540"," for like a week outlook, three week outlook, four week outlook, anyways, so that's my point that"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3616540","3621340"," I'm trying to get to here in the Russell, okay, is that you should see this a great rally over here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3622380","3626780"," we're going to break this down to a smaller time frame so you guys can take a look at what you're"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3626780","3634140"," looking for, you saw we came down below, right, we tried to break, breakthrough previous highs"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3634140","3639820"," failed, we came down to retest the second time, that's a big move right here, when you see something"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3639820","3646780"," like this right here, this means we've, we've tested this twice, so this is looking on the Russell"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3646780","3651900"," for some positivity, we're expecting the Russell to be, to be positive as we move forward, okay,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3652700","3656620"," so I'm going to, we're going to put some lines in here for you, some, some, some, some of Captain"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3656780","3663740"," Jim James lines, and we're going to talk about the volatility trigger, on the Rhett, and the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3663740","3674220"," volatility trigger is 2198, so we're going to put one of those in, and what is special about this,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3674220","3679180"," do you guys all know what's special about this, this is important for you to understand something,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3679180","3688140"," okay, 2198, we're looking for, and we're going to get closer here, I want you guys to see what"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3688140","3694780"," I'm talking about here, and okay, so this volatility line that you're looking at right here, right,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3695740","3702700"," anything below here is bearish, you saw this push up today, we ended up, we ended up, we ended up"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3702700","3709100"," jumping above the volatility from, from negative gamma to positive gamma, this is important for"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3709100","3715900"," you to understand as we just jumped above and flipped, so we had a gamma flip in the Russell today,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3716540","3721900"," and we're at the bottom of that gamma flip, so this is the one, if you wanted to pick a stock"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3721900","3727740"," tomorrow, or an index tomorrow to buy, this is probably the one, I want you to be aware of that,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3727900","3732300"," this is the trade, this is a good trade right here, this is a really good trade,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3732300","3736620"," as a matter of fact, I didn't buy, I meant to buy it in the close, I didn't have enough time,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3737420","3743100"," I wish I had now, I'm kind of pissed off at myself at this moment, not following my own advice,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3744700","3749740"," okay, so we have 2198, so what does that mean, okay, that means that we're gonna be, I'm gonna"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3749740","3754300"," give you the, I'm gonna, I'll give you some levels below, 2198, I'm gonna give you,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3756380","3764940"," turn this to white, turn this to white down here, you're looking for 2188, that's down here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3769260","3777500"," and you're looking for 2198 over the next one, let's see, no, did I already put the 2198"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3777500","3785420"," at one end up there, right, 2175 right here, and then I'm gonna do another one, 2168,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3790620","3796460"," somewhere in there, 2168, I'm gonna give you guys another one,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3797020","3805820"," that one's gonna be right there on 2168, 2138, somewhere down here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3807660","3813660"," and then put this one down here, okay, so if we're, if we're trading down here and you're a bear,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3814220","3819020"," you're gonna be taking this down, right, you come out of your trade, you wait for it to come back"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3819020","3825900"," down, this will be major, some, or mid major support, and this is huge support down here, okay, this is"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3825900","3830540"," like, this is where the put wall is, this is where you're gonna find some, some, some, some,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3830540","3834940"," some middle of the road support, this is where the gamma flip is for going above,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3837100","3843420"," and then we're gonna tag some, tag some resistance above here, from this point, we're looking for"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3843420","3855820"," 2218, which is right there, is that it, right there, 2218, 2238, right there,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3861340","3862940"," we're gonna throw another one up here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3863580","3869580"," and 2274,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3875980","3883580"," take that down, and you can start to see, make this one a big, big fat one, so you guys can see"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3883580","3890300"," where we're headed, make that huge up there, right, you always notice we make these moves like this,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3890300","3896060"," we end up doing this, this ripper right at the end, right, that big ripper, we'll bring this chart"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3896060","3903420"," out so you can see it, whoop, so that's really not that high is it, we're just trying to break"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3903420","3909340"," through all time highs, right, it's not really as big of a move as it seems is it, even if small"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3909340","3914780"," caps recover just to this point and don't break through, you're talking a huge trade ahead of us,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3915580","3922140"," it's a huge trade ahead of us, start to see it play out even better here, right, we're now on"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3922140","3927420"," positive gamma, and this is where Bill Bulls are looking to take this, that's a big move, you know"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3927420","3936300"," we're at 2200, you're talking about 270 point move for the Russell, and we haven't even broken,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3937260","3944860"," we haven't even broken out of a localized top, right, we had a top back here on December 8th,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3944860","3954780"," that's a 270 point move, that's huge, what's that, close the inverse, yep, volatility line,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3954780","3959660"," how is that calculated, wait, volatility line, how is that, so there's a couple of things, okay,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3960540","3969100"," there's volatility above here at 218, between 221 or 2218 and 2238, there's, excuse me, there's a"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3969100","3978460"," call wall above at 2274, and down below here there's a put wall, okay, at 2138, these puts printed"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3978460","3984140"," already, you understand that these puts printed, and so now we're looking to go above to make those"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3984140","3991900"," puts worthless, that's the basic way to describe it to you guys, and you can use, so your swing"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3991900","3997740"," high, swing lows and pivot highs and pivot lows, you can use those as we trade forward, but where"
"hS3y69sGdsg","3997740","4003260"," this bounce was today they're more difficult to calculate, so the question, I'm thinking the question"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4003260","4010540"," is, do we come back down and retest below here tomorrow, do a half back on the Russell, I highly"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4010540","4018780"," doubt that, because of where we are right now here, okay, on this 2202, on the S&P, do you know"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4018780","4025500"," what where this line was, this 2202, it was down below at 4,600, it was, I'll bring that one back"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4025500","4033580"," up for you, so you can understand where we were, okay, the difference in these two charts, okay,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4034140","4043820"," so the volatility line for the Russ or for the ES was down here as of today, this was the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4043820","4050860"," volatility line, so when you guys are asking me like what's the trade and I'm telling you it's the,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4051660","4058780"," so down below here is where we were in the Russell, the Russell just just finally jumped above,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4058780","4064220"," back above, this is the expectation in the Russell, this move right here would be the expectation"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4064220","4069980"," in the Russell, okay, so this is negative gamma down here, this is all positive gamma up here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4069980","4073900"," so and we're already high on this positive gamma right, you see that we're already hot in a high"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4073900","4080540"," place in this positive gamma, and on the Russell we're just coming back into positive gamma, okay,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4081900","4087260"," this would be the positive gamma or excuse me, this is the, so this is the positive gamma up here,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4087340","4092860"," we're at the start of it, am I describing that, I'm trying to make this simple for you guys,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4094700","4099740"," weekly is rather than zero dates, yeah, so the Russell, this is a great place for the Russell to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4099740","4107340"," take it in the money week, or in the money monthly, you could take just a two-week trade spread on"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4107340","4113020"," the Russell, it'd be a beautiful trade, easy street, my expectations would be high for it,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4113020","4120060"," you would need a pretty major market event for us to revisit down below here, right now,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4120060","4126140"," it would be a lot, it would take a lot, you'd need something, maybe Kathy Woods, you know what"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4126140","4133660"," could send us down below here, if there was any threat, some of you Tesla boys out there, Tesla"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4133660","4140220"," gang out there might know this, if you're a longtime Tesla investor, Kathy Woods has a tendency to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4140620","4146700"," or people like Kathy Woods and Kathy Woods have a tendency to sell out of their speculative growth"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4146700","4152300"," stocks during quarterly OPEC, OPEC's, I think they've already done that these past couple weeks,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4153260","4159020"," but it's possible that they could even sell down more or not take new long positions"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4159740","4165980"," in speculative growth stocks as we head into OPEC's, if that happens, I will be watching it closely,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4165980","4172460"," very closely, I'm looking for, on this OPEC's, for more buying into speculative growth stocks"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4172460","4178460"," as we move forward, that could send IWM lower or the Russell, so you have to be aware of that,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4178460","4187900"," absolutely, yeah, it should be, no, so the positive gamma doesn't, so there are, when you're coming"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4187900","4194060"," to, so if I tell you that we're in positive gamma, or if I were, so if we're in negative gamma,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4194540","4199980"," you should see relief rallies and we head lower until we meet some form of support"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4199980","4207340"," or some large gamma area, some sort of large gamma or combo area of resistance as we head lower,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4207340","4212700"," but we're overall in a bearish stance, right? We're looking to take short, not take long,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4212700","4218220"," if we're in a positive gamma territory, we're looking for dips to take long, that's what we're"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4218220","4222380"," looking for, any, you buy any dip in a positive gamma situation."
"hS3y69sGdsg","4224780","4228860"," Oh, she did, James, I didn't know that she sold again, she's known for this, they're all known"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4228860","4233500"," for this, you guys, it's funny because sometimes they get yelled at by, by speculative growth stock"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4233500","4238300"," bulls, and they scream at me and say, you're not a real Tesla bull, and I'm like, boy, you know,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4238300","4241740"," you really like a lot of these other guys out there, you like the Cathie Woods that are out there,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4241740","4245180"," you like, there's a bunch of other guys out there, I'm not gonna name them all, but"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4246140","4251500"," these guys all sell out too, all these guys sell out, and then they rebuy back in every quarter,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4251500","4256700"," they do it every single quarter, now they take their profit, they rebuy up their positions back"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4256700","4261900"," in, so you're looking for that to happen in this OPEX, you're looking for Cathie Woods to buy back"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4261900","4268380"," into Tesla on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of next week, you'll be able to see it, you can see it in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4268380","4273180"," the dark pools, and you can see it in the option flow, so we will track that as we move forward."
"hS3y69sGdsg","4275420","4281020"," Yeah, 90,000, 85 million worth, yeah, they, dude, these, some of these big-time Tesla bulls,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4281020","4286060"," they're, they're, they're evil, and, and I'll tell you what, if you're a new Tesla investor,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4286060","4292060"," your trading plan is should be a lot, should be, should mirror, or you should have a different,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4292060","4296300"," different take on how you're trading, you should always be buying your lows, selling your highs,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4297100","4301340"," rolling that into the next low, so when you get them, come into a new low, you'll buy another low,"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4301420","4306380"," you actually buy the stock, and then you're going to trade long, right, so you should be"

"hS3y69sGdsg","4576740","4581260"," channels and support levels and things like that so it's complicated but I'll"

"hS3y69sGdsg","4675980","4680500"," still not in negative gamma territory so that's wild to see as well right so"

"hS3y69sGdsg","4907020","4911180"," does not trade any deeper down below this is going to be making a move higher"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4911180","4917860"," there was a ton of selling I think all of NASDAQ is below it's oh not all but"
"hS3y69sGdsg","4917860","4921460"," you know you've got like 60 or 70% of NASDAQ is below its 200-day moving"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5095100","5107380"," 15 5 63 this is good this is interesting so our next gamma wall it's like 5 16 5 75"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5108380","5120460"," this is a squeeze type situation here I'm gonna have to look at this tomorrow"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5258460","5262300"," they were going up my expectation is gonna be you're gonna see a lot of tech"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5262300","5268380"," squeeze candidates heading into end of month my price target for the four over"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5268380","5283220"," here price target for end of month is going to be 16 17 0 1 9 5 that's crazy"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5283860","5294780"," let me get right there call it 17 0 3 5.25 that's my price target and I think"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5294780","5301500"," that's pretty reasonable 17 0 3 5 heading into December 31st and I need to look"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5301500","5307220"," I need to watch tomorrow I need to watch tomorrow and see if there's a bid in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5307220","5312780"," Nasdaq because if there is that it could get really squeezy around here I think"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5312780","5317940"," that would not matter if Apple came down it could be some big squeeze on big"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5317940","5325980"," tech so let's look forward let's look at that tomorrow okay so yep 17,000 I think"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5325980","5331660"," it's on the table it's it's on the table does it happen I don't know I have to"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5331660","5339740"," see we're gonna need to see if we need to see if over opex we sell down here if"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5339780","5344780"," you need is the big the big question right now is do speculative speculative"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5352060","5356620"," we if the ones I want to buy are the tech companies that have been down since"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5356620","5362700"," February of 2021 like any tech that's been down for a year I want to see them"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5362700","5368060"," catch a bid if you see them catch a bid and you see speculative tech growth"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5549700","5556060"," going on is you've got people that have bought lemonade at 5 10 12 bucks and they"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5556060","5561500"," can eventually sell the second thing that you're looking for out of an IPO is"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5561500","5570140"," you're looking for them to have year over year growth or no let's call it"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5570140","5575620"," quarter over quarter growth 30 quarter quarter over quarter quarter over quarter"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5635940","5640540"," want it to be more like Robinhood and so that was an issue for me the second"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5640540","5645220"," issue was that I found better rates elsewhere that was a concern to me as"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5645220","5649020"," well I was able to to get better rates in other places that didn't have to search"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5654140","5659700"," other point is this you're also looking for where did where did the IPO where"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5817320","5822160"," their ER reports and their guidance that they lend and you want to start to see"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5822160","5832120"," multiple quarters of of lemonade or any other company that are actually"

"hS3y69sGdsg","5858720","5864160"," first chance they get this is a hard resistance channel here coming down"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5864160","5871480"," right you are looking for capitulation moves you'll actually see this big red"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5871480","5875600"," bar you'll see a giant green bar that'll give you an indication that banks are"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5875640","5881120"," starting to buy back in to a stock but you're also looking for something else"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5881120","5886920"," along the way so let's say you get a capitulation move down here and you get"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5886920","5895280"," an email that says hey lemonade tagged tagged here at I got a ding they tagged"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5895280","5905280"," at 46 they tagged here at 46 91 on my alerts so you start to pay attention here"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5905280","5910320"," to lemonade right so what are you looking for before you enter lemonade and"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5910320","5914920"," take it long how do you know I want to take lemonade long I'm gonna show you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5914920","5923880"," right here you're looking for lemonade to come up here right start to absorb"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5923880","5932080"," these sellers in here consolidate make a move past the sellers and above here"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5932120","5937520"," somewhere right and then to take it long this is a bit there's there's more"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5937520","5940800"," complicated ways of looking at this but you're looking for a couple things"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5940800","5946240"," you're looking for consolidation right this is where you're absorbing sellers"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5946240","5950440"," you're attracting buyers when you attract the liquidity into the market"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5950440","5956920"," here you're looking for the absorption of sellers above you can you can't take"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5957000","5962640"," this move until where we break above the sellers that are stuck in here and the"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5962640","5966600"," liquidity that's coming in now let's say you get to this point right you're"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5966600","5970720"," normally going to tag below here and the reason being is because you've got"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5970720","5975680"," hidden sellers above at different levels you've got some sellers somewhere right"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5975680","5981480"," here so that's why you'll see this move down this will be a resting phase when"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5981480","5986040"," sellers are being absorbed by buyers and you're gonna say okay I'm gonna so"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5986080","5991320"," take this long to here I'm gonna take my profit wait till we rest and what'll"
"hS3y69sGdsg","5991320","6004160"," happen is here you'll see see more sellers hiding here you'll see more"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6004160","6011280"," sellers hiding here somewhere in here and ultimately of how sellers hiding"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6011280","6015040"," way up there okay so first thing you need to remember here is there's a lot of"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6015040","6021600"," work in here this takes a lot a lot a lot of buyers and sellers to get out"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6021600","6026520"," of this is a long slog this is more than likely going to take a year it's"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6026520","6030640"," anywhere for I would say no less than six months to try to even attempt to get"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6030640","6036520"," this high you need multiple multiple great ERs you need them to be producing"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6036520","6041440"," some kind of profit for the banks to get heavily involved and so my point is"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6041440","6044360"," that you're waiting so right now you're gonna be waiting what are you looking"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6044400","6050080"," for to long lemonade right well you're looking for this move over here you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6050080","6055320"," don't want to get stuck in here between anything between this 46 and $60 unless"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6055320","6060080"," you're day trading it possibly is a big danger zone this is this is bad"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6060080","6063760"," volatility bad gamma this is all bad news right now you want to see this"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6063760","6067840"," hard resistance broken for this next leg up you want to take this leg up here"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6067840","6074320"," you really want to catch this $46 to $74 move now if you see in here we"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6074320","6078880"," start to break below we can't break out of this major resistance it's still not"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6078880","6084280"," time to buy until you see that capitulation you see the banks step in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6084280","6089640"," with huge volume and then we're going to make a move higher okay so I don't like"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6089640","6095200"," lemonade right now if you're asking that's right absolutely you want to see a"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6095200","6100120"," back test but this is how you base this is how you catch falling knives to be"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6100120","6103920"," honest with you this is how I catch falling knives if I said enough of these"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6103920","6109560"," alerts on companies like this and do 200 of them I will catch one of these"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6109560","6113440"," moves outside of one of these major and you can set an alert on this on this on"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6113440","6119120"," this one right here on this trend you can set that alert okay so if you set"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6119120","6124440"," that alert on this on this resistance channel on 200 companies you are going"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6124440","6131160"," to identify ones that have a reason to start catching knives on does that make"

"hS3y69sGdsg","6160640","6168240"," on Tesla I might have moved but we had a hedge wall at 950 why you didn't know"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6168240","6177680"," that okay what does that mean for Tesla we have a hedge wall right here at 950"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6177680","6187120"," just so you all know we have let's talk about some consolidation areas for Tesla"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6191080","6196560"," right this is going you remember we had this this remember this move in"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6196560","6201560"," January this was crazy right we sold down into May remember that big sell down"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6201560","6205480"," into May I know some of you that are watching right now traded this whole"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6205480","6211240"," move with me we traded this move remember we traded this move this all"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6211240","6214960"," summer long move here this was an insane move let's move this move printed"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6214960","6225920"," heavy we know that where do I want to buy start let's think from a bank's"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6225920","6230360"," perspective okay I'm gonna explain to you how I come up with that 750 number"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6230360","6239440"," here in just a minute okay okay so why do I say Tesla's coming back to 750 why"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6239440","6243640"," do I say that on social media people always want to know why I say that on"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6243640","6250920"," social media why am I being so bearish I'm gonna explain to you guys right now"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6250920","6253920"," why I'm bearish"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6261520","6266960"," this is what you need to know here in Tesla okay we had lots of consolidation"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6266960","6275560"," down here we came to a point in Tesla this was not a move made by you and I"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6275560","6282920"," this was a move that was made by banks so the banks pushed this up at the 750"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6282920","6289880"," area okay so let's start to think from the perspective of a bank eventually"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6289880","6294680"," they want to take their profit from the move that they made so we they move"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6294680","6300320"," this up right and what did they do at 1242 well they were down they were in we"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6300320","6304640"," knew we talked about this summer some of you in this feed right now some of you"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6304640","6308440"," in this feed right now we're here with me this summer and I said the banks went"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6308440","6314120"," long okay so right here this is this profit push right here okay so they"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6314120","6318800"," pushed this up took it to 1240 or something stupid right something"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6318880","6326920"," absolutely ridiculous way up here remember this okay they pushed this up and they"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6326920","6330320"," have now taken started to take their profit does that mean we don't trade up"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6330320","6334920"," and in here as we trade down to 750 no does that mean we have some crazy push"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6334920","6342080"," up no we can have those okay the point is that computers banks algorithms what"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6342080","6346360"," they do is they raise it back up to create more bag holders as they sell"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6346440","6352720"," down out of their position to take it long once again so the question would be"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6352720","6358240"," see how low we got down here see how low we got this was the bottom right so"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6358240","6362800"," where's your next bottom it's probably somewhere here see how Tesla continues"
"hS3y69sGdsg","6362800","6367280"," to go up if this is your bottom and this is your bottom then you'll have a bottom"
