"574070","581850"," to 0 spot 1% expected so ahead of this just gonna make a we'll see a quick note from"
"581850","587810"," Wells Fargo so they know that July bought the third consecutive monthly bump in headline CPI sub 0"
"587810","593310"," spot 2% before the rounding these softer readings brought three month annualized headline pace down"
"593310","599310"," to only one spot nine percent that being the smallest clip since June 2020 so Wells Fargo note that"
"599310","605370"," muted energy price growth explains a big chunk of July's modesty given that CPI's a survey captured"
"605370","610930"," only the very beginning of the recent upturn in gas prices but even core inflation seems to be"
"610930","618450"," pumping the brakes notching two consecutive monthly up these core prints amounts to a three month"
"618450","623630"," annualized rate of 3 spot 1% in the month of July a steady progression down from the 4 spot"
"623630","630490"," 1% in June and the 5% in May so Wells Fargo they say they see the forecasted for"
"630490","636910"," core CPI gaining 0 spot 1 80% in August rounded to 0 spot 2 according to a 4 spot"
"636910","642890"," 3% year over year rate for the core CPI reading if realized Wells Fargo said that the Fed would"
"642890","648850"," achieve its elusive 2% targets on a three month annualized basis within core commodities and"
"648850","653970"," shelter likely propelled the deceleration didn't worry to you however Wells Fargo expects a roughly"
"653970","660010"," 10% jump in gas prices to lift the headline rate to 0 spot 6% month over month which"
"660010","665910"," would mark the largest monthly jump in headline CPI in over one year bringing the year over year"
"665910","671430"," headline rate to 3 spot 6% so again those were just some common tree from at Wells Fargo head"

"777200","781780"," strong believe it or not this is actually a nice positive for bulls could have some more downside"
"781780","790140"," though a half hour saying no 15 saying no but the early saying to be a little bit more weakness"
"790140","797880"," coming up here we're gonna be a bounce higher we'll take a look at that this morning at the eight"

"1089170","1099130"," you know we need to see this morning so this morning we need to see year over year"
"1099130","1107750"," below below three that's what we need to if you're a bull you need to see below three"
"1107750","1116010"," previous I believe it was 3.2 we have out there's an anticipation that the read is gonna be higher"
"1116010","1121170"," there's an expectation that the reading is gonna be high we're gonna have a bump in the road here"
"1123210","1131570"," that's my that's my bring daughters to the that's my bring bring daughters to school thing yeah"
"1131570","1141470"," let's look at this figure screen here so the"
"1141470","1162380"," forecast was 3.6 oh 3 "
"1162380","1170600",".7 so we're actually up point one that's pretty bad 3.7 was the median forecast came in at three"
"1170600","1178980"," point excuse me 3.6 was the expectation we came in at 3.7 and then of course CPI was"
"1178980","1184040"," higher as well I believe I was getting at these numbers really quick so pretty pretty bad this"
"1184040","1193980"," morning so switch over to the main and see"
"1193980","1203840"," what reaction is well not too not too bad right after that well"
"1203840","1211040"," 3.36% got a yen having higher as well 4.44 32 trading right now those bad as I"
"1211040","1216600"," expected at the moment I was expecting more more blood at this point yes this looks nice on here"
"1216600","1226240"," but anyone interested slightly hotter reading than the forecast not good for bulls"
"1226240","1236080"," that it definitely don't want to see that trading 4.42 our 4.44 20 right now this looks like"
"1236080","1245960"," a really bad bar but it's really not too bad there's bad news good news no it's"
"1245960","1252340"," pretty bad new it's not it depends on how you look at it as CPI comes down or excuse me"
"1252340","1258740"," as inflation comes down normally you expect two bumps in the road maybe three somewhere in there"
"1258740","1268400"," two to three bumps in the road there wasn't old we already expected this morning to have 3 "
"1268400","1277780",".6 year over year came in at 3.7 so it's it's it's hotter than expected but not crazy not"
"1277780","1286960"," crazy hot is it bad or is it bullish no it's most certainly is not bullish most certainly is not"
"1286960","1295480"," or at least the short term it's not and then in the long term is it bullish if we were"
"1295480","1301900"," if we were in the inflation dropping or fighting inflation cycle for where we are"
"1301900","1311640"," you know you're probably going to hear people say higher for longer that's bullish in the medium"
"1311640","1318420"," term if the fed has more work to do and that kind of stuff short-term interest rate futures down"
"1318420","1325720"," slightly after the August inflation report so I'd expect a negative reaction to it but is it like"
"1325720","1335080"," roll the market down to 300 3,500 bad no we were talking about that yesterday as well binking our"
"1335080","1343440"," out of the conversation about like when is bad really bad when we get 2% like when we get"
"1343440","1349540"," when we get 2% like two months before we get 2% as soon as the bad dream is"
"1349540","1359540"," right I take that course you guys don't you guys you guys will see"
"1359540","1366660"," that as bullish it's a it's a weird thing you're going to end up seeing like a you know as"
"1366660","1373720"," we get to that that 2% target from the fed from my perspective you're going to see an initial"
"1373720","1381780"," exuberation from that right your market will react positively good job fed and then we get a blast"
"1381780","1390400"," down right it's really to the depths of hell so it's it's a hard thing to explain but it's not"
"1390400","1393860"," it's not actually a hard thing to explain we can look at it I can show you all the prior"
"1393860","1401840"," examples of this but even within that there's like a two month period there's a two month period of"
"1401840","1411240"," a front running usually to the downside so you really are right now"
"1411240","1420740"," you really are right now if you really are so if you're if you're"
"1420740","1429300"," if you're if you're a collapse bear right if you're a collapse bear out there you're slightly jump"
"1429300","1436920"," in my view you're slightly jumping the gun in looking for that actual role that you want and I"
"1436920","1446580"," don't mean down to 430 or 420 or any of those things you're let me see I'm word this properly"
"1446580","1452740"," I should we should look at the macro right now in second show it to you but there are instances"
"1452740","1462500"," of this in the past so you look at the perspective of the mandate of the Fed"
"1462500","1467620"," is going to get is going to be maximum employment get inflation or two percent right or at least"
"1467620","1474940"," that two percent something like that you're not going to have an activist fed that goes rogue"
"1474940","1478420"," they're gonna they're gonna work within that parameter we know"
"1478420","1488260"," that that's logically they're going"
"1488260","1498040"," to be banks out there that are trying to front run knowing when that pause"
"1498040","1507220"," is coming at least the pause by about two months so if I'm an analyst or if I know Jerome"
"1507220","1516780"," because he already knows the numbers excuse me they're likely going to know when they're pausing"
"1516780","1524100"," and these banks want to you know front run the stuff so there's gonna be a want to jump across"
"1524100","1530120"," the starting line right there's a gun and there's a bunch of runners on the track and they all want"
"1530120","1537940"," to run right they want to front run that expect that expected pause and then rate cuts now you'll"
"1537940","1545500"," often hear bulls say things like whatever we cut rates or we pause or cut rates it's extremely"
"1545500","1554320"," bullish they they leave out a caveat that likely two months before the market was actually front"
"1554320","1560660"," run to the downside and we're likely at a bottom once those cuts take place once you see those cuts"
"1560660","1570660"," the market's likely burning right so what is this reading mean they"
"1570660","1578680"," can't front run yet the downside to the market like the bad one right the juicy one it's likely"
"1578680","1585600"," going to be pushed off or or at least the belief is before you can front run so if we"
"1585600","1592620"," were under two percent or under three percent this morning I would expect an exuberant reaction to"
"1592620","1600600"," the upside and truthfully you could probably front run the downside move to the market much sooner"
"1600600","1609640"," because you'd expect that once we get into those twos that the discussion will turn to we won the"
"1609640","1618900"," war inflation and expect pause sooner than later so there is some positivity to this for bulls it's"
"1618900","1624180"," not it's not like the exuberance it's not the hey we're in 2% we're gonna go to the moon"
"1624180","1633720"," I don't think the bears will see that or the sellers will see the the significant down move that"
"1633720","1642000"," they're looking for until we break below that no that 3% right now we have I think I'm reading"
"1642000","1648020"," a 3.7 so we'll look at it right now U.S. short-term interest rate futures down slightly after"
"1648020","1655800"," the August inflation report CPI energy plus 5% this 5.6 to the gasoline we kind of knew that"
"1655800","1662580"," was coming right we were we traded oil and gas we knew that it was going to explode gasoline plus"
"1662580","1672000"," 10.6% new vehicles plus 3% 0.3% CPI year over year actual was 4 "
"1672000","1682000",".3% the forecast was 4.3 the previous was 4.7 CPI month over month actual was 0.3 "
"1682000","1690360","% the forecast that came in pretty fucking hot forecast was 0.2% previous point to CPI month over"
"1690360","1699540"," month actual 0.6 forecast is 0.6 that's in line previous 0.2% CPI year over year"
"1699540","1709160"," 3.7 the forecast was 3.6 so 0.1 higher than previously markets recovering"
"1709160","1717500"," right now yeah it's a hard thing to hard it's just"
"1717500","1725780"," you know I've said this on the show before too this is a hot topic right now too because there's"
"1725780","1733120"," some some real estate scumbag is out there saying that we need 50% unemployment to teach workers"

"1857340","1863600"," unemployment rates is one more that I'm missing here but it's okay these are the these are the most"
"1863600","1873300"," important here let's we have"
"1873300","1882860"," some pretty decent examples of this let's look at 2000 2008"
"1882860","1892480"," kind of stuff we got a good one here for you to see so this is a spy right"
"1892480","1911280"," here I guess we could do SPX but SPX and probably the best way to look at this the"
"1911280","1921240"," first one that you're looking at this orange line up here this is the effective funds rate you"
"1921240","1929640"," can actually see well it's that's fun rates let's go over a couple things here to give you guys"
"1929640","1938720"," some some explanations to some of this stuff we'll raise some of this up for you"
"1938720","1948260"," you know one of the best truest one of the this is"
"1948260","1954840"," SPX this orange line right here is the effect of funds rate so this is the effect of funds rate"
"1954840","1964520"," right here this is the rate of inflation right here and this is the unemployment right here down"
"1964520","1970140"," here's tens and twos not as important as you think it is I know a lot of you out there"
"1970140","1975800"," like you guys like to let you guys are like it's the tens and twos or it's the tens and"
"1975800","1984180"," threes that's what matters right now and truly you're you're best across the board"
"1984180","1993080"," you're if you had to pick one one thing that you're looking for it's almost always"
"1993080","2002900"," the unemployment rate let's let's be honest about it and you'll you'll see big"
"2002900","2010500"," roles in the marketplace when the unemployment rate rises you can see it right here it's the most"
"2010500","2015320"," consistent you know as a matter of fact when you see people out there that are on fin-twit and"
"2015320","2020660"," they're using tens and twos and tens and threes and stuff just always ask them about unemployment"
"2020660","2027580"," now they're gonna argue with you it doesn't matter because we've got you know we don't have enough"
"2027580","2033620"," young or we don't have everybody's got a third job right now there's never gonna be a high"
"2033620","2043120"," unemployment rates in the future but the truth is historically if we see that that unemployment"
"2043120","2052420"," rate rise here is a great example right here you've got the unemployment rate rising and you've got"
"2052420","2059780"," the pausing of rates you see that pausing of rates right and then of course the Fed comes in starts"
"2059780","2066600"," cutting rates too late right and it's getting front-run to the downside markets topping rolling"
"2066600","2075040"," down right you're really looking for that this this this is the bear Goldilocks right here right so"
"2075040","2081520"," unemployment is the big one for you it's the most consistent one here's another example of"
"2081520","2089239"," unemployment rising you can see it right here and the markets rolling over your seat you can see"
"2089239","2094719"," the pausing of rates oops you broke something let's start cutting cutting cutting cutting right and"
"2094719","2101700"," then we then once they've completed their mission of cutting rates and you can see inflation coming"
"2101700","2107500"," down right here as well the most consistent one that I've found historically is always the"
"2107500","2116160"," unemployment rate so you know it's it's curling up right here if you look at the unemployment rate"
"2116160","2125620"," you know it's it's got a little curl right here so we're close right we're close we're not quite to"
"2125620","2132980"," the flattening here yet but we're getting there now we've got a we've got to jump here at inflation"
"2132980","2141860"," but whenever inflation comes down it's usually a rocky road so here's inflation right there's"
"2141860","2147960"," usually a bumpiness to this as we come down and the longer they're still trying to fight inflation"
"2147960","2157720"," right as we go higher you're going to expect rates to continue right but there is there is a moment"
"2157720","2165060"," where so you're going to expect rates to still go higher and the simple"
"2165060","2175020"," way to think this is the Fed is doing its job right there their operations are not done yet right"
"2175020","2180720"," but this is working down here right start seeing that come up starting to see inflation bottom"
"2180720","2187220"," start to see this flatten and you're going to expect some kind of role to take place and I think"
"2187220","2195100"," everybody expects that role to take place it's just a matter of timing it like that is the key is"
"2195100","2203040"," is timing it and we're still not quite there yet we're almost there I'd really like to I would"
"2203040","2209240"," really like to see inflation down at that too and then the the front running of this flattening and"
"2209240","2216260"," this line coming up just a little bit more so like are we there today no when we look at"
"2216260","2226240"," stuff like this does it oftentimes oftentimes your your newspapers your CNBC"
"2226240","2235920"," your fin twitters they want it to matter today like it like it's gonna matter"
"2235920","2243360"," today but it really is not going to matter today it really isn't I'll be honest with you it really"
"2243360","2251220"," is not going to matter today is it gonna matter in the next three months a good there's a good"
"2251220","2259340"," chance of it as we as time passes yes it will matter will will there be like I'm right the"
"2259340","2265380"," first time out of a hundred times yeah we know that we think every market participants knows that"
"2265380","2275260"," that is happening absolutely do I think that every market market participant knows that's happening"
"2275260","2285180"," absolutely but is it here right now at this moment believe it or not a better"
"2285180","2295180"," read on inflation would signal yes a better read on inflation would signal we're closer"
"2295180","2304900"," so if you're a bear then you are looking for believe it or not I know you're not gonna agree"
"2304900","2314600"," with this but you are actually looking for a better read on inflation so if you're a bear out there"
"2314600","2322760"," and you're like cheering yeah we got a hot read in my view you would want in my view you"
"2322760","2332400"," would want that you would want that better read not better better better I'm selling a child"
"2332400","2340420"," you can tell I have children because my I speak like a child right now but you would if you're"
"2340420","2344960"," if you're like the hey I'm looking for that big roll cap I'm looking for that retest of thirty four"
"2344960","2352340"," five hundred or retest the trough or any of that kind of stuff in my view it's more than likely"
"2352340","2361320"," the better the readings the closer you are you are to that happening and unemployment is almost"
"2361320","2366380"," there if you look at the unemployment the rate of unemployment it's getting there it's not there"
"2366380","2375000"," yet but it is getting there you can see the effects of the feds well we'll talk about that but"
"2375000","2381540"," you can see the effects of the federal fund operations right now there's a lot of argument that"
"2381540","2389420"," they start those operations know already knowing that inflation is going to come down there are"
"2389420","2397180"," people out majority of people out there believe the fed actually impacts inflation I'm not one of"
"2397180","2403900"," those people I think they time it to coincide with business cycles so that inflation does come down"
"2403900","2411060"," natural business cycles the marketplace but you know if they do have an impact that I end up being"
"2411060","2418640"," wrong so be it but you are looking from from my perspective you're looking for that bottoming of"
"2418640","2425880"," inflation you the ad the adverse effect of of that work that's being done would also be"
"2425880","2435300"," unemployment rising at a rapid rapid rate and we're seeing it we all know it's there it's just not"
"2435300","2444020"," today and if anything this prolongs in my view it pushes off in my view that thesis so if you"
"2444020","2451340"," were a collapsed bear you are looking for under three percent you're looking for that for that kick"
"2451340","2457860"," start of we're almost near the end they've likely broken something we're going to front run where"

"5681530","5688450"," I know all about I so to see guys know I'm quite familiar with Elliott wave this system is based"

"5695470","5704680"," what do they use what's the term to use invalidated right so if we to this number it's invalidated"
"5704680","5708360"," right we can move the other way but I know all about it I get what you guys are saying"
"5708360","5716240"," the bear count is is legit right now I am if so if you're one my like my litmus test"
"5716240","5723600"," of where I am I'm hyper aware that the bulls are on their last thread their last song that they're"
"5723600","5731720"," in a 10 chapter booked in the last pages of it into the end of quarter I do realize hyper"
"5731720","5737420"," aware that there is a bear count there's an inverse head and shoulders forming I am aware of all"
"5737420","5744340"," those things but you know it's like anything you know you know let's look at some really quick"
"5744340","5751600"," let's let me explain it we'll explain it better to you let me explain it I don't even have to"

"5769380","5776180"," times I love Elliott wave I do I appreciate it and I have a lot of respect for it but"
"5776180","5784120"," you know it's not it's not an exact science is it and we can invalidate shit all over the place"
"5784120","5791320"," I think that's one of the like you as a trader and investor you have to be able to adjust"
"5791320","5797120"," like you have that in front of you like I see it I got it I I know what to"
"5797120","5803760"," expect if this happens but if that doesn't happen what does that mean right and so people get"
"5803760","5811520"," people get caught on that or their thesis right like I've got a I've got a thesis every day right"
"5811520","5817180"," I've got a one-minute thesis I've got an hourly thesis I've got a four-hour thesis I've got a"

"5868760","5874020"," no matter what you're gonna get run over you're gonna lose your money and your money matters more"
"5874020","5881920"," than anything above everything your money matters the most so if it goes against your thesis the"

"5918360","5928120"," doing what you do but you know the thesis is good as you know even my thesis is there only"
"5928120","5934200"," as good as as long as they're valid the moment they're invalidated you take on that other you take"
"5934200","5938060"," it on the other thesis and you run it down you make the money because the money is what matters"
"5938060","5944240"," right end of the day that matters more than you know you're not going to see me in your house"

"7167070","7172690"," us here belly of the short he covers the markets force all right some big news out of city group"
"7172690","7178970"," of good friends over there at city group former employer of mine baby structuring to give me some"
"7178970","7184210"," head count reductions let's break it down with two people who really know this stuff and that is"
"7184210","7189270"," Shonali bossack she covers all Wall Street for Bloomberg news and of course Allison William she is"
"7189270","7195670"," our senior banks analyst at Bloomberg intelligence Allison thanks you join us zoom Shonali here in"
"7195670","7200310"," studio Allison start with you how big of a deal is this for city you've covered this stock forever"
"7200310","7207690"," so I think you know I would characterize it as a reorganization perhaps versus a restructuring"
"7207690","7214270"," where I think they're just really trying to you know clean up the reporting lines and and maybe"
"7214270","7221050"," help management to be a bit more focused and also you know showcase you know as an analyst I'm"
"7221050","7225890"," excited to get cleaner reporting where we can you know finally see what's happening with their"
"7225890","7231330"," private bank with their wealth unit you know there was some hints at this over the summer just to"
"7231330","7236510"," end and you know even prior I guess with some of the hires that they made and I just think"
"7236510","7244050"," it's you know another step in in James journey if you will in terms of just making this a cleaner"
"7244050","7250990"," more focused banks and back and hopefully getting to the efficiency that investors have long wanted"
"7250990","7258330"," them to get to so yeah yes Shonali I mean is this gonna help Jane Fraser boost the stock price"
"7258330","7264510"," because that's bottom line right and I'm looking at you know over the last five years they're down"
"7264510","7270690"," 30% whereas Goldman's up 63% Morgan Stanley is more than doubled it's certainly a tough story for"
"7270690","7275790"," city group we have had her first set of restructuring here if you will where she let go of certain"
"7275790","7282090"," consumer businesses around the world and now what is difficult for Jane Fraser and their investors"
"7282090","7287510"," of city group is that there are still a lot of unquestria a lot of unanswered questions about this"
"7287510","7293350"," reorganization one being how many jobs will be lost underneath the surface our sources say that"
"7293350","7297370"," there could be significant had account reductions here because what city group is doing is removing"
"7297370","7304410"," layers of management and this only this announcement only addresses the top two layers the reality"
"7304410","7309750"," is is they're going to be looking across management around the world across divisions one of the"
"7309750","7316450"," things they did in this reorg is they got rid of many of their regional divisions here so the way"
"7316450","7319570"," you think about city group now is that their city group North America and their city group"
"7319570","7325770"," International and you now have five main business lines it's no longer just the main two which is"
"7325770","7331430"," institutional client group as well as the consumer offerings most of that consumer business now is"
"7331430","7337770"," the United States North America okay so there was a real reason that they needed to do this city"
"7337770","7344270"," group today does not look the same as city group two decades ago when the initial set of current"
"7344270","7349550"," structure is what you see in in a way you can see this is the most significant reorganization in"
"7349550","7356510"," two decades because this is really getting rid of the groups that we have known for so long as it"
"7356510","7361930"," strikes me Allison as it came out of my mouth I realize probably Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley"
"7361930","7369850"," aren't the best comparison to city in terms of stock price performance you know Wells Fargo over"
"7369850","7374810"," the last five years is also down only 10% not 30% but also down Bank America over the"
"7374810","7379770"," last five years is only up 8% so not down 30% but up 8% are those better"
"7379770","7386010"," comparisons for sitting I think they are I think at the end of the day when we look at all"
"7386010","7393070"," of these banks you know the way that investors think about it is you know the valuation is going to"
"7393070","7400310"," be tied to returns as it should be right and so someone like someone like Morgan Stanley that you"
"7400310","7404530"," refer to the comparison could you make could that you could make is they've improved their"
"7404530","7409790"," structural returns through moving towards the wealth business you know looking at someone like JP"
"7409790","7416530"," Morgan who's a very different bank they're actually executing you know above all of their peers you"
"7416530","7421270"," know part of that is the scale that helps the profitability across their businesses and they have"
"7421270","7428030"," leading returns and so the struggle with city and I think you know part of the reason why it's been"
"7428030","7433030"," tough for the stock is they just have not been able to improve the returns"
"7433030","7442730"," and if you know during certain periods of time with all their big"
"7442730","7448810"," charges had had some weaker returns but they're sort of on the path to better profitability and so"
"7448810","7453890"," that's really what Jane needs to deliver on at the end of the day it is those returns and I"
"7453890","7461350"," think why this is important is you know as you clear the structure and you know that's been one of"
"7461350","7466270"," the biggest issues of city is all the bureaucracy and and really sort of a messy organization but"
"7466270","7471190"," if you can get that cleaner and you can improve the efficiency of those core businesses they do"
"7471190","7476750"," have some good businesses to work with some high returning what should be high returning businesses"
"7476750","7482550"," should know what do you think Jane Frazier wants the message to be about city group and I think"
"7482550","7487910"," like Morgan Stanley I think of James Gorman pivot towards wealth management so successful what do"
"7487910","7494050"," you think Jane Frazier would like that view of city to be you know on one hand it's simpler for"
"7494050","7497890"," James Gorman to sit there and say we are an investment bank and we are a wealth and asset manager"
"7497890","7505110"," for Jane Fraser it's a different story her goal here is to have all of her managers essentially get"
"7505110","7510950"," one message which is get leaner they have one of the largest investment banks in the world but just"
"7510950","7515770"," take the M&A business for example the reason I bring up the M&A business is you are sitting"
"7515770","7520690"," there they are sitting at a number six and the lead to it was actually just looked at it got"
"7520690","7525910"," kind of stunned because they're behind center view which is a lot you know and that is in terms of"
"7525910","7530890"," deal volumes and that you know a year two years three years ago is just the stunning thing to see"
"7530890","7536050"," this late in the year and so the share that they need to gain to keep those fees up as"
"7536050","7540550"," well as squeeze every dollar out of the cost that they have you know it's a twofold story it's one"
"7540550","7546510"," get competitive and win to be more efficient with every dollar we have to improve profitability and"
"7546510","7552510"," so you know the investment bank is a really good example because in this reorg one open question"
"7552510","7557770"," among those five business leaders is who will run the investment bank over at city the banking"
"7557770","7563950"," business currently they have tapped an interim head Peter Bubba who is the CEO at the Asia business"
"7563950","7569050"," yep you have to consider this this is one of the top five M&A businesses in the world it"
"7569050","7574090"," is one of the hottest jobs on Wall Street and guess what they have a huge IPO business a huge"
"7574090","7580250"," and unready business and that person you can't imagine wouldn't one day be the successor for Jane"
"7580250","7586230"," Fraser herself yep you know again they have a consumer business that's quite large as well but they"
"7586230","7590550"," have a massive investment bank and it is a seriously competitive spot and my buddy Tyler Dixon"
"7590550","7595450"," still running the investment bank over there so he and he's under the new banking I know that's"
"7595450","7599670"," interesting but Tyler's just one of the smartest guys in the room every room he's in Shanale"
"7599670","7604750"," Bassett thank you so much we got Allison Williams thank you so much as well let's go to Karen"
"7604750","7609330"," Moscow right now for a Bloomberg business web yeah I'm calling Matt watch the stocks turn lower and"
"7609330","7615350"," now they were higher for the open and the start of the morning but now again they're lower after"
"7615350","7619890"," that mixed inflation report S&P 500 down to tenths of a percent out of about eight points it's at"
"7619890","7624810"," 44 54 the Dow Jones Industrial average on a tenth of a percent or thirty six points at thirty four"
"7624810","7628750"," thousand six hundred eleven and then as to extend a quarter percent or thirty five points at"
"7628750","7632690"," thirteen thousand seven hundred thirty eight and the ten year treasury up to thirty seconds you'll"
"7632690","7641190"," four point two seven percent that's a Bloomberg business flash Paul and Matt all right Karen Moscow"
"7641190","7647390"," thank you so much we appreciate that lots going on here today we want to pivot hard here and we"
"7647390","7652690"," want to talk pharmaceuticals and we want to talk drugs and all the kind of stuff and we can do"
"7652690","7657090"," that well one of the biggest winners of the day biggest winners of the day Stefan Bansal CEO of"
"7657090","7663950"," Moderna that is a NASDAQ traded stock MRNA is the ticker to put into your Bloomberg terminal you"
"7663950","7667790"," know nobody I guess when you sit around your your Thanksgiving table everybody likes to just"
"7667790","7672870"," complain about drug prices right everybody does it since cross the aisle but I turned it around a"
"7672870","7676930"," couple years ago and said okay we can do that because we always like to complain about drug prices"
"7676930","7682890"," but these guys in the farmer in the biotech industry man did they come through with coal yeah I"
"7682890","7689530"," think actually as a society we were all a little bit relieved I'm like in 12 months these guys came"
"7689530","7694450"," up with a vaccine I mean who does that but you guys did thank you very much thank you to"
"7694450","7699230"," the Pfizer folks and all the other farmer biotech folks out there that man did they come through"
"7699230","7704350"," with that vaccine appreciate it now what do you do with Moderna tell tell us that you guys have"
"7704350","7710830"," your R&D day today you bring out all your new stuff for your investors for your stakeholders what's"
"7710830","7716410"," the big message for your R&D day today is that's we're not a covid company yes for the kind"
"7716410","7721850"," of world yes but we are thank you though and the money platform company and the platform is firing"
"7721850","7728350"," on every cylinders today we're not seeing positive flu data in phase three so if you think about it"
"7728350","7734550"," in terms of vaccines we are free out of three covid working our SV file to be FDA and to"
"7734550","7743690"," the positive flu data in cancer we have now products showing 44% improvement versus the best drug"
"7743690","7749670"," available to patients today which is immunotherapy in melanoma skin cancer and we're gonna start"
"7749670","7755430"," before the end of the year the phase three study in learn cancer so okay cancer we really want to"
"7755430","7763230"," transform as well is that is that by the way because of mRNA technology and I'll just remind"
"7763230","7768870"," listeners we are talking with Stefan Bonsell right now he's the chief executive officer of Moderna"
"7768870","7777430"," and as you said you're not just a covid company you did have an mRNA vaccine for covid that maybe"
"7777430","7782310"," saved the world a lot more pain than it would have seen but you also have a flu vaccine that"
"7782310","7789630"," is driving the stock up today six and a half percent and cancer treatments that we hope we all hope"
"7789630","7794870"," I think are going to be successful and could drive revenue another 15 billion starting in 2028 so"
"7794870","7800110"," tell us about the mRNA technology that we all kind of learned about a couple years ago sure so"
"7800110","7806590"," ammonia as we learned about is an information molecule we basically code in that molecule what"
"7806590","7812830"," protein we want your body to make that would be your drug your medicine and in cancer now what we"
"7812830","7820130"," have shown is a huge impact on survival and being able to not have recurrence of disease compared"
"7820130","7825050"," to the best drugs available to the two patients and the third chapter for us after infectious"
"7825050","7831690"," disease vaccine and cancer is rare genetic disease we are now three out of three rare genetic"
"7831690","7838110"," disease showing positive data in kids with those disease that have no hope today zero hope all"
"7838110","7845110"," right so back to the flu because it's we're getting into flu season what is your flu vaccine what"
"7845110","7850970"," is new what is different what it just tells about what today why are people so excited about the"
"7850970","7856010"," flu vaccine because first we're going to be able to participate and provide a very high efficacy"
"7856010","7861630"," flu vaccine what we've shown in actually over studies is that actually it's as good as a best"
"7861630","7866310"," vaccine on the market for flu but what people are thinking excited about is the idea of combination"
"7866310","7872870"," meaning we are going to show before the end of the year flu and COVID combined in the single shot"
"7872870","7877210"," so in the following years you won't have to go and get the flu shot in one arm and the"
"7877210","7881810"," COVID shot in the other arm they'll be combined and then over time when they keep adding more and"
"7881810","7887450"," more risk or at all your virus like RSV to the combination as well so that you can have only"
"7887450","7891610"," one shot early in the fall of the pharmacy and then you have a happy fall or in winter you're"
"7891610","7897290"," not sick so but this is for next year this is not for this translusives okay got it just want"
"7897290","7901070"," to get clear on the timing you can still get your flu vaccine for this I'm gonna go down to"
"7901070","7909010"," LL2 and get my flu vaccine I mean who doesn't do that but so with MRN a technology what's it"
"7909010","7914790"," three to five years down the road what do you expect that technology to tackle next maybe yeah so"
"7914790","7921290"," we're announcing today at R&D day that we should launch 15 new drug in the next five years 15"
"7921290","7925710"," new drugs in the next five years that's incredible across cancer infectious disease and genetic"
"7925710","7931210"," disease we're also working on auto immune disease I think after I trace chronic disease and so on"
"7931210","7939330"," we believe we're gonna bring 50 more drugs on top of 40 we have in development okay 50 five zero"
"7939330","7944530"," okay from the lab into the clinic in the next five years there are 10 new drugs per year moving"
"7944530","7949370"," from the labs into development so what you see here is a true platform there has never been"
"7949370","7954810"," platform in the biotech pharma industry as you know most drugs go to the clinic yep they fail 90%"
"7954810","7960930"," of the drugs starting at phase one we'll never get launched okay 90% look at the moderna because of"
"7960930","7962190"," our platform because mr."
"7962370","7967010"," is an information molecule we are free out of free in vaccines we are free out of free in real"
"7967010","7972810"," genetic disease cancer in critical improvements and it's just the beginning all right this is all"
"7972810","7979910"," because of the mRNA technology and I have a funding question then what happens if you know the"
"7979910","7987170"," covid vaccine revenues don't meet your expectations can you still fund that kind of growth sure I"
"7987170","7990690"," mean if you look at it we say that this year we should be six to eight billion dollar off"
"7990690","7996890"," sales which is still a very significant number for turnover we have 14 billion dollar on the"
"7996890","8002350"," balance sheet that we got for the covid sales over the last two years and so we can fund around"
"8002350","8007930"," we think 25 billion dollar of R&D growth by cash generating by the business and the balance sheet"
"8007930","8012910"," and we will also not be shy to partner if we have to we are obsessed about getting those drugs"
"8012910","8018470"," to patients to the finish line but if you look at for example we vertex we partnered for cystic"
"8018470","8024610"," fibrosis for inhaled mRNA getting to belong over kids at that cystic fibrosis by inhalation we"
"8024610","8029910"," developed that technology yet another fourth cylinder for moderna to develop a new family of drugs"
"8029910","8034090"," and so that's what we're trying to do is push a boundary of science get more and more drugs and"
"8034090","8040310"," if we have to partner we'll partner but but it's expensive to do and you know because of recent"
"8040310","8046390"," legislation the United States the the Biden strategy to pass the United States is going to not only"
"8046390","8055810"," negotiate prices with drug makers but set prices with drug makers is that a concern to you very"
"8055810","8063050"," much so as the rest of the industry as voice you cannot set prices because R&D is risky as"
"8063050","8070310"," we just talked about 90% of drugs entering the clinic fail very very high failure rate of the"
"8070310","8074930"," industry as a whole if you start to set price and not look at the value that is bringing by"
"8074930","8079890"," the drugs you're gonna reduce the ability of pharmaceutical and biotech companies to invest in"
"8079890","8084350"," innovation and that's a big worry but they're going to set prices so how are you gonna deal with it"
"8084350","8089850"," so we just need to keep innovating and figure out ways to go after you know smaller disease type"
"8089850","8095810"," selling around the world because again the US of course is the number one market in the world but"
"8095810","8101170"," over markets are also very important like Europe you know Japan and so we're gonna have to grow"
"8101170","8105810"," internationally as well but it's a big issue I'm worried about it all right how about I always joke"
"8105810","8110470"," that in my next life I want to come back as a healthcare M&A banker because every Monday we"
"8110470","8114450"," come in and there's another healthcare deal that you are one of your competitors do is there"
"8114450","8120710"," something that you need to buy in the next couple years to get to where you want to go that"
"8120710","8125490"," maybe it's not in your pipeline right now no what is cool about M&A is we are the world"
"8125490","8130890"," leader in M&A even biotech which is a great company they are doing small molecule large molecule a"
"8130890","8136190"," lot of different technologies we are only doing M&A what we're doing through our beauty activity is"
"8136190","8141510"," ever buying we bought a company in Japan over the Christmas break the cool technology to make our M "

"8153790","8160710","&A molecule to do new drugs so this will do to expand the potential of impacting patients all right"
"8160710","8164790"," excellent to have you in here really appreciate it and I know you're gonna go on television in just"
"8164790","8170890"," a moment so our our listeners will be able to to watch you with Alex Steele and Guy Johnson on"

"11912340","11918980"," Microsoft Nvidia and even so some is Tesla Tesla's become from a car company to a technology"
"11918980","11927020"," company so it's hard to say and hard to think that AI won't keep driving tech on some level but"
"11927020","11933160"," it has to I believe that and you never want to say 100% but I think tech is here"
"11933160","11938220"," to stay and interest rates will obviously affect that but you know AI is the next big big boom"
"11938220","11944660"," we'll see where that goes how do you use ETFs in kind of your work with your thoughts yeah ETFs"
"11944660","11951460"," we mix ETFs with active managers different asset classes like on the value side I just said was a"
"11951460","11955720"," there's some good ETFs that are doing their thing given a four percent dividend so we're a mixed"
"11955720","11961880"," bag as many advisors are trying to mix active management with ETFs we typically don't play all in"
"11961880","11967520"," one space and try to get some diversification and play out and ride out these storms and get a good"
"11967520","11973220"," rate of return going forward don't put all your eggs in one basketball yep I know very new thought"

"11997180","12004040"," was the fixed income market for 2022 everyone was bullish on it big time what happened interest"
"12004040","12010000"," rates just rose brought the market values down and now total return fixed income is flat but you"
"12010000","12015660"," can't ignore the yield that you're getting on those on those bonds so bonds are good they're giving"
"12015660","12021300"," a great yield are you looking for a big you know a play on total return didn't happen this year"
"12021300","12027180"," could continue we'll see if it's a moderator come down but in general you sound pretty conservative"
"12027180","12034720"," so you're not rushing out there trying to wring out the last basis point of alpha no Matt no when"
"12034720","12039800"," I try to do that we're trying to get I think the name of the game is consistent returns let"
"12039800","12043680"," me volatility and walk away with something that's respectable and I think the wealth alliance does"
"12043680","12048600"," that pretty well so is I guess the question for a lot a lot a lot of folks is you"
"12048600","12054660"," know is that 60 40 portfolio you know a lot of people last for saying boy that's got crush that's"

"12058580","12065220"," of still there with a diversification the 60 40 really was an eye opener last year you know bonds"
"12065220","12071520"," made that happen fixing come drop 13 to 14% that hurts so suddenly everyone was down on the 60"
"12071520","12078000"," 40 in 2022 year to date the 60 40 is keeping up with an equally weighted S&P and a"
"12078000","12084900"," Dow suddenly the 60 40 looks pretty good so I think it's a it's a strategy that could be augmented"
"12084900","12090720"," but it's a good strategy are there some sectors of the market that you really like here I mean are"
"12090720","12096020"," you our previous guests at Fred Altras said management they're growth investors and they're just"

"12116180","12123020"," feel very comfortable going on to it chasing growth right now is scary incredibly volatile and"
"12123020","12127080"," that's not something we like to do so I like the value play that's that's the way we go on"
"12127080","12133960"," the other hand Apple is a bet that seems to never go bad right I mean Paul's angry and has"
"12133960","12138620"," been for years they don't pay a dividend but they buy back like a hundred billion dollars of stock"
"12138620","12145720"," every year Apple is you know you're struck goal if you put Apple way back when it's anyone's play"
"12145720","12152060"," it's a great company and they're doing their thing but I would love to have Apple back in 1980 you"

"12161640","12167180"," looking for the kind of the consistency in returns now we're consistency return shop but again hard"
"12167180","12174780"," to ignore the capital outlay that Microsoft Nvidia has put into AI I mean you should have companies"
"12174780","12180480"," that large putting that much money into a play I gotta be honest with you guys it's it's hard to"
"12180480","12186580"," turn you back to it yep my uncle likes the data centers yeah data centers yep server farms server"

"12231690","12237690"," right we you kind of like watching that right we know this is trend right here so trend is here"
"12239070","12246290"," so pay close attention trend is above right so getting back into trend is what bulls want right to"
"12246290","12253830"," get back in trend right now bulls not in trend still right trying to smash up in a trend smash"
"12253830","12261370"," up in a trend smash up in a trend they want to get above not below for sellers to step"
"12261370","12268210"," in right you don't want to see well these sellers keep stepping in and trying to defend this right"
"12268210","12273350"," to the downside you're going to keep trying to plunge this to the depths of L but we're going to"
"12273350","12280510"," look at something that's very important so we're going to go over the trigger screen here and we're"
"12280510","12291030"," going to look at Apple specifically so the Apple 180 so at 175 14 175"
"12291030","12300510"," 25 right now and Apple now they're intraday like day trader kind of stuff they it's looking like it"
"12300510","12308010"," wants to rip here here and the daily looks like it wants to rip to the upside but there is"
"12308010","12316010"," more danger to the downside for Apple so if you're at home right now I want you to pay attention"
"12316010","12323330"," to a few things like so number one the five minute triggers max bearish hourly trigger max bearish"
"12323330","12332430"," that's actually a bullish signal on swing trading for the bulls if we were to get the daily trigger"
"12334810","12342210"," bearish in the weekly trigger bearish that would mean that we're flipping two bears on Apple so we"
"12342210","12348690"," don't have that quite yet where we're teeing off of the hourly the daily to the downside on Apple"
"12348690","12358610"," right now we don't have that that volatility on this ticker so"
"12358610","12368030"," until we get the daily and weekly to turn bearish okay so that's this one right here until that"
"12368030","12375550"," turns bearish that's fairly neutral right now on Apple right there's no like hey we're going to be"
"12375550","12382070"," teeing off this stuff but I do want you to pay attention to Apple specifically and I want you to"
"12382070","12391630"," pay attention to some key levels this 160 176 07 is a key level right here this 176 67"
"12391630","12401470"," or 176 06 is the key level and your next key level for Apple is going to be 180"
"12401470","12411090"," 209 so these two levels right here are key levels as long as price stays below I'm not a happy"
"12411090","12419310"," guy because if this daily comes down if this daily comes down and begins to trade below the weekly"
"12420490","12428090"," I will actually turn bullish on Apple right so I don't like seeing this it's not there yet but I"
"12428090","12435810"," don't this here I don't like to see so it's a key level for you so 180 209 key level"
"12435810","12445550"," 176 07 key level it doesn't necessarily need to carry the stock market all of those 180"
"12445550","12454030"," C's for this Friday are near dead I think they're under 20 cents now so you are looking for can"
"12454030","12461030"," we trade that back up right the bulls want to see into next week a recovery of some sort at"
"12461030","12470610"," minimum and truly for the market to get bullish you want to see Apple's price above 182 so if"
"12470610","12475270"," you're a bull and you're like hey I'm bullish from the stock market or I don't know I want to"
"12475270","12484690"," see the bearish uh count thesis on Elliott wave to be gone you can likely use uh 182"
"12484690","12493550"," on Apple as a as like a side check right if you're like actually like hey uh the seller's thesis"
"12493550","12501470"," is dead if you're looking for that dead confirmation it's above 182 on Apple okay it's a key number"
"12501470","12510630"," here for bulls is to trade Apple higher and defend 182 like defend it right and start heading"
"12510630","12519570"," higher again if we they start heading higher on 182 I assure you you are going to see some crazy"
"12519570","12527650"," moves to the upside so keep your eye on that 182 on Apple make maybe make it alert at home"
"12527650","12533210"," or something like that whether you're a buyer seller I don't care just if you're if you're in this"
"12533210","12540270"," market set an alert on 182 and some change pay attention to that level whether you're a bull or a"
"12540270","12547690"," bear it's going to give you some kind of insight uh if the bearish down thesis is is gone or"
"12547690","12554450"," not now for you sellers out there uh you know what you need to do right you're already underneath"
"12554450","12562630"," the the weekly trigger not good to see you want to be defending this 176 to the downside and even"
"12562630","12568850"," if you get the squeeze up to 182 you want to be defending that as well so that 182 is"
"12568850","12577470"," like a key level for sellers this weekly is a key level as well for sellers need to be defending"
"12577470","12583170"," that these two numbers make sure that you're selling this down that you are holding the line here"
"12583170","12590210"," if you get squeezed out that that's your next place to send this market to the depths of hell so"
"12590210","12597530"," that bear thesis on the market still live at the moment or at least Apple saying it's still live uh"
"12597530","12605130"," it's the everything here says uh what this is how you interpret this over here is your neutral on"
"12605130","12613590"," Apple Carley uh and you are in a short position on Apple Carley unless we dirt do turn up uh"
"12613590","12621190"," though though it is leaning towards uh the bottom for bears right now on this hourly trigger so"
"12621190","12626830"," there isn't some kind of an expectation of a squeeze higher here on Apple but you know as long as"
"12626830","12632690"," we stay below this hourly trigger uh the weekly trigger uh I'm neutral here until we start to roll"
"12632690","12639970"," down because this pay attention to Apple Apple is giving some really good signals right now just"
"12642760","12647600"," watch this right here you can even watch this like this just at home make yourself a nice little"
"12647600","12653360"," chart make yourself a nice little line going like this and you can kind of see it going up and"
"12653360","12662280"," down and up and down until this whole thing fails like you start failing down here we are bullish"
"12662280","12671380"," right now on the on the stock market grinding higher climbing the wall of worry right now hey"

"12784030","12789570"," interesting deal um laying out for this company when you look at kind of where we are talking to"
"12789570","12793790"," some of the analysts and investors latest in a string of consumer facing companies that have filed"
"12793790","12799030"," so consumer if you're profitable if you're growing you have durability some insight into where"
"12799030","12804890"," you're going going forward uh seems to be one of the areas alongside tech that there is interest"
"12804890","12811210"," both from the company and from investors all right so that's um that's nothing that kunjan cares"
"12811210","12817470"," about no he's a lead semiconductor analyst um maybe you're wearing burkin stocks kunjan but you're"
"12817470","12823850"," focused i guess primarily on arm right yeah all right talk to us about this this ipo arm is a"
"12823850","12829270"," uh tell us what arm is and tell us kind of what the pitch is from your perspective yeah so"
"12829270","12834850"," arm is a semiconductor design ip company they don't make chips they make an ip which other chip"
"12834850","12841250"," makers can use and cle for creating chips historically they're because they have been they have the"
"12841250","12846610"," largest i mean entire market when it comes to smart for 99 percent market share so that's what they"
"12846610","12851710"," are very historically and when software bought bought them the play was that iot supposed to be"
"12851710","12857270"," this big thing so they got into iot they have internet of things right internet of things yes and"
"12857270","12862950"," they're still a dominant player in that market the pitch right now for the ipo is really on ai as"
"12862950","12869550"," is what every semiconductor company these days um right now they have single digit market share in"
"12869550","12875590"," data center and ai but the pitch is that that market share will grow and they are expected to be"
"12875590","12881150"," the fastest growing when it in that sector all right so but kunjan you've been around we hired you"
"12881150","12886410"," away from Deutsche Bank so major upgrade there um kunjan you've seen this stuff come and go you"
"12886410","12892090"," know what the real deal is they're asking me at the ipo to buy a phone chip design company but"
"12892090","12899810"," pay an ai multiple is that is that the gig that is almost yes okay are you buying it um"
"12899810","12904450"," so when they came out with the initial target of six to seventy we wrote that this seems very"
"12904450","12909950"," ambitious okay one exactly one of the reasons what you pointed out but the pricing that they came"
"12909950","12915450"," out which midpoint of fifty we liked that as a starting point we thought that would invite some"
"12915450","12919910"," attractive positive discussions from the investors and it seems from the data we have heard that"
"12919910","12926390"," they are numerous times oversubscribing their time but yes to answer your question i mean look this"
"12926390","12931310"," happens i was also in banking before so i've done ipos for semi-companies and this is how usually"
"12931310","12936610"," the conversion goes viewing ipos people are pitching way far out like what this can be in five"
"12936610","12942250"," years and the theory is if you believe that this is you're buying it today for lower because once"
"12942250","12947090"," it gets there once they have a lot of data center revenues they're going to get a lot more premium"
"12947090","12954510"," for the valuation and that's where investors can generate that account very good a belly burkin"
"12954510","12959410"," stock i mean it's is what's the pitch here is it just is this gonna be a lifestyle kind of"
"12959410","12962870"," way they're gonna be five years out yeah we're i mean the same thing as there were fifty years"
"12962870","12969370"," before i mean what's changed no i mean they were in the barbie movie so that reinvigorated interest"
"12969370","12974570"," with the youths um when you look at their sales they're one of the things that stood out in the"
"12974570","12979450"," filing is kind of this push towards direct to consumer sales so trying to cut out the costs of"
"12979450","12984050"," going through a traditional brick and mortar or other kind of website would when you look at it"
"12984050","12991650"," though eight billion dollar price about 18 times forecasted adjusted eBITDA so in line with an ikis"
"12991650","12998770"," of the world though margins are typically higher for burkin stock here comes apple right now trying"
"12998770","13004170"," to fight for the upside move on apple right now talking to a couple of analysts maybe a lulu could"
"13004170","13012170"," be really seen as the high end but it's going between 176.99 is bullish to 182.09 per squeeze"
"13012170","13018650"," consumer facing company that doesn't have these ambitious kind of pitch in terms of AI or massive"

"18233220","18238500"," said it i'll be curious to have you respond they have no clue of what this policy is they just"
"18238500","18243240"," wanted to change it to let the american people know hey we can do what we want to and i'm"
"18243240","18246620"," not going to allow them to do it now if they continue to do it uh we're going to have"
"18246620","18251780"," the same people in place as admirals and generals again there were there's no readiness problem we"
"18251780","18261720"," got people in place that are doing their jobs his point is that if this continues and by the way"
"18261720","18267960"," we're temporary housing waiting for confirmations we don't know when uh but he says hey we've"
"18267960","18272500"," already got good generals and officers in place what's the difference if they hang on a little"
"18272500","18277000"," longer how does this impact readiness in your view or doesn't it i think it impacts not only"
"18277000","18281880"," readiness but morale and leadership within the department of defense and within the military"
"18281880","18287340"," broadly and it's actually really ironic that the party who wraps itself in the flag and in the"
"18287340","18293200"," military is the one that is harming military families and the u.s military's readiness at a time"
"18293200","18301680"," when our adversaries are challenging our leadership in the world you know the one of the first"
"18301680","18307980"," areas that gets cut is training and that that goes directly to readiness we don't let our pilots"
"18307980","18314920"," you know fly uh they don't use live ammunitions and training those are ways in which the military"
"18314920","18320880"," can reduce its spending and and it goes right to the readiness piece but on the leadership piece"
"18321300","18329140"," the joint chief of staff he has a deadline where he cannot continue to serve and so we're going to"
"18329140","18336380"," let our military go without a military leader because one senator wants to be obstructionist we're"
"18336380","18340160"," going to speak a little bit later in the broadcast with michael mccall and if your former"
"18340160","18346060"," republican colleagues chairs the house for an affairs committee uh he called this paralyzing uh to"
"18346060","18351740"," our military is it going to take more republicans like michael mccall to bring this to an end"
"18351740","18356800"," what's what's the off-ramp here for tommy tuberville i think the senate republicans own this one"
"18356800","18363080"," and mike's a great guy and i'm glad to hear him using his voice he's reasonable he understands the"
"18363080","18368860"," debilitating nature of what is happening and he cares about the military and and the families and"
"18368860","18373800"," so i'm glad that here him speaking out but senate republicans need to make life very uncomfortable"
"18373800","18383020"," uh for the senator who's holding up all of these um uh confirmations should the white house or"
"18383020","18392140"," should the administration i appreciate it demo i appreciate it my brother um we should weaponize a"
"18392140","18396340"," government because you're just really punishing people who live in if you were to threaten that but"
"18396340","18402980"," you know his senate colleagues need to put pressure on him find out what it is that he needs and"
"18402980","18408580"," give him half of that half of a loaf and then move on but this is this is playing with"
"18408580","18414380"," our national security and it's hurting the very people who have stepped up and decided to serve"
"18414380","18418960"," this country well one thing we know is he's not getting space commands in alabama maybe that's the"

"21537170","21542910"," deliverables where's the legislation but what actually happened today is there was a gathering so"
"21542910","21548110"," important that it got everyone's attention on an issue that we wouldn't otherwise be talking about"
"21548110","21551490"," we'd be hung up on the news of the day of the impeachment inquiry or whatnot did Chuck Schumer"
"21551490","21557750"," succeed and at least getting our eyes on the ball yes i think if by that measure absolutely you've"
"21557750","21563550"," you've got 20 or more of the most powerful tech executives in the world the people who are actually"
"21563550","21573550"," trying to exploit this control it somewhere in between and at least the u.s. senate is at least"
"21573550","21579610"," heard some expertise on it heard the challenges in controlling it or regulating it which i think"
"21579610","21585510"," would be very very difficult on the other hand this is the same congress who like i think it was"
"21585510","21591830"," about a year ago they had a google executive and a twitter executive in a hearing and the members"
"21591830","21597070"," of congress were asking the twitter ceo about things on google that is couldn't work on his phone"
"21597070","21601850"," and things like that and so congress has a long way to go into just the beginnings of understanding"
"21601850","21607210"," this and this was a baby step well okay sure so billy house was this a briefing was this the"
"21607210","21613490"," beginning of lawmakers learning more about this uh or was it to get all of our attention on a"
"21613490","21620410"," critical issue maybe you have a different way of seeing it well i there's been legislation uh to to"
"21620410","21626830"," regulate put guardrails on ai research and and developments but at the same time it's a it's an"
"21626830","21633410"," area that congress does realize uh is very competitive uh is fast moving so exactly how many"
"21633410","21640570"," guardrails or uh what kind uh you want to put on this uh is something they are going now beginning"
"21640570","21647470"," to understand and i i think some of that discussion took place uh today and also in the context of"
"21647470","21655670"," uh everything including creative rights which is timely now uh and and the impact on for instance"
"21655670","21662110"," screenwriting uh that that sort of thing i know polosi over here in the house was very concerned"
"21662110","21667590"," about that so i mean that we don't know exactly what uh and the parameters of the discussions today"
"21667590","21673450"," but certainly it took in some of those areas you know you mentioned uh tech executives being"
"21673450","21678610"," dragged up for hearings when they're usually torn to shreds in these things because they're usually"
"21678610","21684810"," antitrust related or consumer focused today they're the captains of industry and we need your"
"21684810","21689450"," brains now to figure this out but was this also getting everybody in the room kind of calling out"
"21689450","21694110"," uh all of these executives your companies are on notice you know we actually have our eyes on you"
"21694110","21698390"," here we know that this is important yes absolutely i think that's true and i think some of the"
"21698390","21706650"," questioning reflected them um you know in this whole notion of the vast power with ai that is now"
"21706650","21714190"," in the hands basically of these 20 25 people um and just what they control and congress of course"
"21714190","21720690"," seeing someone else in control of something wants to get in on the game and um but they but it"
"21720690","21725310"," will be a while before they're able to figure out as Billy and others that i even how to regulate"
"21725310","21730530"," this well i've got to ask Billy about what's happening elsewhere on Capitol Hill because it's been"
"21730530","21735510"," quite a 24-hour period uh Billy every video i've seen a speaker McCarthy walking out of his office"
"21735510","21740050"," includes you standing next to him with your phone so i think you're probably the closest thing to"
"21740050","21746250"," the sun uh that we have right now we just learned before i ask you about impeachment or maybe i"
"21746250","21750310"," should ask you about a shutdown that i guess there are members of the republican conference who"
"21750310","21756330"," today blocked debate from even happening over a military funding bill does that make a shutdown"
"21756330","21763370"," more likely oh i think it does and i think it uh it showed this was just a one bill"
"21763370","21771050"," out of the eleven still left to be passed in the house uh that the uh the appeal crime that"
"21771050","21777630"," the speaker in and the house has in addressing government spending before a in the month deadline"
"21777630","21783690"," to to at least do a temporary stopgap measure they couldn't even get a rule which is uh basically a"
"21783690","21790290"," vote on how to proceed on this military related bill uh passed or at least McCarthy worried it"
"21790290","21796550"," would not pass there was no agreement and so he he took it off the floor so uh that's certainly"
"21796550","21803470"," not a good sign and and it's kind of left people uh uh back on their uh hinds uh back"
"21803470","21808070"," pedaling on some of their claims that this can get done and and uh they're downstairs now trying to"
"21808070","21813270"," figure out what kind of pieces to pick up not much less whether those pieces will um you know"
"21813270","21818170"," develop into some kind of uh you know advanced you know of a bill by the end of the month"
"21819430","21825150"," speaking of back pedaling kevin mccarthy answering questions now and having to defend his decision"
"21825150","21832690"," to do an impeachment inquiry without a vote uh we've all been thrown back to 2019 after what he"
"21832690","21838950"," said today uh basically it's Nancy Pelosi's fault this this is how he put it Nancy Pelosi changed"
"21838950","21845130"," the president of this house that was this doesn't preclude from a Nancy Pelosi changed the"
"21845130","21850310"," president of this house on september 24th it was withheld and good enough for every single democrat"
"21850310","21856990"," here it was good enough for the judge why you wouldn't have to be different today let's go back uh"
"21856990","21864430"," to september 24th that very day he is referring to listen to them kevin mccarthy our job is to"
"21864430","21870270"," legislate not to continue to investigate something in the back when you cannot find any reason to"
"21870270","21877330"," impeach this president she cannot unilaterally decide we're in an impeachment inquiry okay beyond"
"21877330","21882650"," this is why people hate washington how long can he keep a straight face on that oh he can keep"
"21882650","21888290"," a straight face on this through the senate vote to acquit Joe Biden and i'm only saying that"
"21888290","21892190"," because the senate is a democratic is this a new precedent though we do this every time as a new"
"21892190","21896450"," president just to impeach him it won't mean anything it's shocking i mean in the history of our"
"21896450","21902850"," republic there were there was one impeachment Andrew johnson yixon resigned before he could be"
"21902850","21907390"," impeached and then no it's an annual yeah it's like an annual event exactly every time you don't"
"21907390","21912170"," agree with the president i think you can score political points one party or the other seems to"
"21912170","21918270"," impeach which you know the way we went to school and learned it impeachment is is is literally a"
"21918270","21923350"," nuclear option you should save that for when you there's no other way to to remove a dangerous"
"21923350","21931490"," president um or you know things like that so yeah it's but yes Nancy Pelosi did start it without a"
"21931490","21937550"," vote i think five weeks or five months into it there was a vote um it's for and she did"
"21937550","21943690"," it for the exact same reasons Kevin McCarthy is skipping the vote it's not going to pass and so he"
"21943690","21948950"," even though he said back then his job is to legislate he's going ahead with this impeachment"
"21948950","21954910"," inquiry because he's afraid to lose his job if he doesn't we've heard motion to vacate well we"
"21954910","21960450"," heard it on the floor of billy uh from matt gates yesterday not convinced chipp roy not convinced"
"21960450","21967450"," by this they're not signing on to a continuing resolution apparently how would you describe Kevin"
"21967450","21972750"," McCarthy's station in the universe right now when it comes to to his tenure when it comes to the"
"21972750","21979090"," gavel well it's uh it's basically where it's been McCarthy likes to say he wakes up every monday"
"21979090","21984330"," morning eager for the challenges ahead that the media says he can't solve them and then by thursday"
"21984330","21990170"," they're asking him how he solved them but this is this is far more complicated uh on the"
"21990170","21997690"," impeachment uh in fact he he did not hold a vote in part because uh a good chunk of his"
"21997690","22003890"," car his conference especially freshman members in biden district and districts biden won in 2020"
"22003890","22010750"," didn't want to go on record is voting on anything on impeachment and so this way this sort of"
"22010750","22018370"," unilateral order to hold a hearing uh an impeachment inquiry was his way to insulate them from"
"22018370","22024530"," having to cast a vote uh with regard to plosie she did eventually a hold a vote and that vote"
"22024530","22031390"," actually prompted public hearings so uh McCarthy isn't saying we're not going to have public"
"22031390","22035830"," hearings though before a vote in fact we are that he is planning and the committee chairman"
"22035830","22042310"," involved our plain help public hearing so there are differences even with what plosie did uh and"
"22042310","22047990"," there's no time frame so it's quite possible there never will be an impeachment vote on the house"
"22047990","22054690"," floor but there will be a lot of investigation of a democratic president uh by a lot of allies of"
"22054690","22060270"," a republican potential republican president again well you know what hearing we are going to have"
"22060270","22065590"," and apparently it's going to be this month the first hearing of the impeachment inquiry congressman"
"22065590","22070350"," james calmer who chairs the oversight committee spoke about that in a briefing earlier today we"
"22070350","22078130"," plan on having a hearing in september that will kind of evaluate some of the things that we believe"
"22078130","22084770"," have have happened from the biden family that are in violation with our law so what i said in"
"22084770","22091200"," january holds true to today we are following the money and we will see where that just well so"
"22091200","22095280"," we're still not sure i guess where we are if we're we still need to see where this leads us"
"22095280","22101640"," when the i thought there was evidence to prompt an inquiry if you've seen the there's a lot of"
"22101640","22107840"," people saying they believe this happened they think this happened there is still no hard evidence"
"22107840","22114580"," and unlike the you the attempt to impeach john trump over ukraine there was at least that phone"
"22114580","22119760"," call yeah that the so-called but um some calls the perfect phone call but when he asked you know"
"22119760","22127020"," the ukraine officials to to investigate or to not help by but the uh but yes there was at least"
"22127020","22133160"," something there here we have a lot of smoke no hard evidence and i think the impeachment inquiry is"
"22133160","22138140"," to find some evidence yes and it could lead anywhere as they say uh billy what's going to happen in"
"22138140","22146000"," that hearing in september do we have any idea well there's very good chance that the administration"
"22146000","22150860"," or members of the administration will try to block some of the testimony or documents being sought"
"22150860","22156040"," between now and then for that hearing and so that's kind of rub that's one of the rubs with what"
"22156040","22163760"," mccarthy has done on one hand he likes to say that impeachment inquiry quote unquote elevates the"
"22163760","22169540"," power of the house to obtain documents to to demand testimony at the same time there's been no"
"22169540","22176500"," actual vote on the house floor and therefore can easily be argued or will be argued in court that"
"22176500","22182900"," there's no actual formal impeachment inquiry so he wants it both ways there's also possibly the"
"22182900","22189400"," fact that uh the the possibility he doesn't really want any resolution he's just trying to as as"
"22189400","22199160"," you've mentioned not be ousted by the conservatives demanding he do something at the"
"22199720","22204580"," yeah wow uh this is going to be quite a month it is going to be quite a month as"
"22204580","22207900"," we juggle ending with the government shutdown the start of an impeachment inquiry and potentially"
"22207900","22212460"," the start of a shutdown although the conventional wisdom just a couple of days ago was that a"
"22212460","22216660"," stopgap was in the cards or are we moving on from that apparently after this business with the"
"22216660","22221740"," defense bill today doesn't look like a stopgap is going to be accepted by the hard right"
"22221740","22227200"," conservatives yeah they want to they actually have said they want to shut down the government so"
"22227200","22231920"," that they get their way at least they're threatening them so they get their word makes it difficult"
"22231920","22236100"," for Kevin McCarthy to count on democratic votes to keep the government open so here we have it's"
"22236100","22240600"," not getting easier it's getting a lot harder i'm hoping he still wakes up monday morning feeling so"
"22240600","22246140"," optimistic well i'm glad someone is wendy thank you wendy benjaminson it's always a great pleasure"

"22302780","22307860"," coming over now we have breaking news from the house today around this time we're talking about"
"22307860","22314300"," yesterday an impeachment inquiry uh today as we were discussing with wendy and billy uh an attempt"
"22314300","22321940"," to even debate military funding was blocked in the house so we're wondering if this is already over"
"22321940","22327660"," well it certainly feels that way doesn't it or is it just such that it's the beginning of all these"
"22327660","22333420"," negotiations that everyone is coming in fully with their walls up and they're not willing to make"
"22333420","22340000"," any concessions so early on because they say in congress time 18 17 16 days that's actually quite a"
"22340000","22346180"," long time well i suppose that's right what do we have 17 days to a potential shutdown um with that"
"22346180","22352860"," said though the idea of the house and senate getting together is quaint when the house gets get"
"22352860","22357500"," itself together doesn't seem like it'll happen in this lifetime as that's how it feels right now"
"22357500","22363260"," sure but at some point they have to fund the government that's true that's coming at the end of"
"22363260","22367680"," this month uh we could have a lot of things happen between now and then and we'll talk about that"
"22367680","22372660"," in just a moment with michael mccall but there are a lot of different things that we're looking at"
"22372660","22377740"," if it's an impeachment inquiry hearing this month uh that's going to take a lot of time potentially"
"22377740","22384720"," away from negotiations that democrats may not be very friendly uh in now because of the impeachment"
"22384720","22388980"," maneuver so well exactly this is where i think it's very difficult for macarthur not just him he's"
"22388980","22395320"," doing his own caucus but because he decided to go for this probe any democratic votes he needed the"
"22395320","22402860"," democrats to vote for a continuing resolution has he now just negated them they're not going to"
"22402860","22409440"," sign up for his plan because of this impeachment inquiry it does feel like he's more of a line on"
"22409440","22413940"," republican votes or the democrats say we're going to take the high road we want to keep the"
"22413940","22419260"," government open all great questions here but it's going to be a difficult maze for him to navigate"
"22419260","22424560"," that is for sure as we find the headline on the terminal gop hardliners stall military funding"
"22424560","22430220"," raising shutdown risk and we add the voice now of michael mccall uh the congressman from texas who"
"22430220","22434980"," chairs the house foreign affairs committee congressman it's great to have you with us on bloomberg"
"22434980","22438780"," thanks for coming back and now that we're getting back into the swing of things here in washington"
"22438780","22443820"," indeed we'd like to ask you about a few issues but with regard to this latest development here did"
"22443820","22450260"," that make a government shutdown more likely well as i understand the rule has been postponed i"
"22450260","22455900"," think they're working out details with the defense appropriations bill so i would not try to read"
"22455900","22462360"," too much into that i'm still hopeful that we will have a you know a rule vote this evening and"
"22462360","22469140"," move forward with the defense appropriations bill you know possibly as early as tomorrow so i don't"
"22469140","22475260"," see that shutdown as imminent as maybe you're indicating i you know frankly i'm not a big fan of"
"22475260","22482680"," shutdown i've never seen a shutdown work very well especially for my party uh republicans always"
"22483350","22489180"," send a lose when the government shut down so thank the america people want us to to govern and they"
"22489180","22493800"," want us to to get things done i think the speaker is trying to do that and it's as you"
"22493800","22499280"," noted very difficult kind of the circumstances but you know he's always been underestimated every"
"22499280","22503880"," time and he seems to be able to pull you know rabbit out of the hat you know in prior"
"22503880","22511560"," uh legislation that we've had so i i still remain optimistic comes what we're talking about here is"
"22511560","22517400"," that the hard line house republicans didn't even vote to allow defense spending to be debated this"
"22517400","22522720"," is in the house in the senate we still have senator tommy tubberville holding up more than 300"
"22522720","22529080"," military nominations what do you say to american people who look at both the house and the senate"
"22529080","22535380"," and say the republican party is potentially hurting the u.s. preparedness military preparedness and"
"22535380","22542560"," it can cause national security concerns i i have i share those concerns and i voice those on uh cnn"
"22542560","22547720"," say the union on sunday but i you know i think it's important to put into context the Biden"
"22547720","22555060"," administration for the first time used uh taxpayer dollars to fund uh this uh abortions within the"
"22555060","22561860"," military that's never been done on the national defense authorization uh in fact we cured that in"
"22561860","22567680"," the house uh with our india bill that will be conference with the senate so my whole point was that"
"22567680","22574220"," i don't think one senator blocking all these nominations uh is really uh the more productive route"
"22574220","22579520"," i think the best route is to deal with this in the conference committee that we will have house and"
"22579520","22585840"," senate to ensure that taxpayer dollar is not being used for abortions in the military um i think"

"22678560","22684500"," how you want to achieve the same goal and i think holding up these nominees in key positions at the"
"22684500","22691240"," pentagon does not send a very good message when you look at when you look at china we have to"
"22691240","22696400"," ask you what you make of wallway coming out with this phone that looks like they use technology the"
"22696400","22703720"," exact technology that they're export controls on china and chinese companies csm ic and also"

"22748420","22754800"," this very advanced technology seven nanometer chip you know when you look at the hypersonic program"
"22755340","22761280"," that was built on the backbone of american technology when it comes to the seven nanometer chip and"
"22761280","22767640"," you look at things like ai and the future of warfare which will involve this kind of uh semi "
"22767640","22774840","-conductor chip that is is what is most disturbing to me is that now china they're they're very good"
"22774840","22779820"," they don't really invent things they're very good at stealing our technology and this is another"
"22779820","22785940"," good example and you know the timing amory this is announced the day that sector namando left"
"22785940","22792920"," Beijing with a real slap in the face uh that hey now we got your technology uh we got your"
"22792920","22799280"," most advanced semiconductor chip uh we got to stop doing this we got to stop selling to china our"

"22817920","22826580"," relationship with china at this point now we can't cut uh all uh trade but i would argue that with"
"22826580","22833520"," respect to certain sectors yeah like the advanced semiconductor chips like ai like quantum"
"22833520","22840100"," computing uh this is something i've talked to the commerce department about making it more uh"
"22840100","22846260"," rather than companies uh specific because china will change the name of the companies but if you"
"22846260","22853400"," make it sector specific to me that's a better way to handle this that way all exports regarding ai"
"22853400","22861040"," cannot be exported to china all exports regarding quantum and advanced semiconductor chips and that"
"22861040","22866120"," way you deal with it in a very uh i think a blot you have broader blanket that i think"
"22866120","22872400"," would uh apply and we're gonna have commerce with china they're a big market for the united states"
"22872400","22879340"," and we buy a lot from them but when it comes to national security supply chain like semiconductors"
"22879340","22886200"," like critical minerals rare minerals and medical uh we need to start pulling that supply chain out"
"22886200","22892520"," the reason i introduced the chips for america act and got it passed was secretary pompeo came to me"
"22892520","22900080"," and said we got to pull supply chain out of taiwan because t smc controls 90 of the advanced"
"22900080","22907560"," semiconductor manufacturing for the world so imagine this scenario where china invades taiwan with"

"22933040","22936980"," administration still seeks a meeting with shizhing ping to try to make sure at least they're"
"22936980","22943080"," putting pressure on Beijing to then put more of a pressure on both its neighbors in russia and in"
"22943080","22950900"," north korea look i think it's always it's always good to uh have meetings and have conversations"
"22951420","22957980"," but you don't concede certain things that i think you know we saw like a um certain export controls"

"23291760","23297900"," in bought it and they've been aggressively buying this all day right they're just stepping in"
"23297900","23303800"," stepping in trying to get that squeeze up and over to keep us in trend to the upside you know"
"23303800","23313120"," until until buyers lose that um there's there's not a lot to say for uh selling here so let me"
"23313120","23317680"," say it's i don't know if you switch this over but you're basically looking for if you're if you're"
"23317680","23322140"," a seller you're looking for you're looking for that down move right here if you follow my screener"
"23322140","23327740"," to the bottom left hand side and then you're really looking for uh for this right here right you're"
"23327740","23332500"," looking for uh demand to leave you're looking for demand to leave right here and to get some"

"23490270","23495850"," were to get it might not be until after all of that stuff is out of the way does that"
"23495850","23503090"," make sense so dealers pin as much as they can and then if if the full basket of bad news"
"23503090","23511310"," means something maybe you see that that that move after all of these events are over and not before"
"23511310","23516830"," right so there's a little bit of front running here by uh sellers right trying to sell into that"
"23516830","23524610"," bad news hoping there's that bad news i was on the phone last night with uh binky and he said"
"23524610","23531250"," you know what would you do into um he asked me what i would do into cpi and all of"
"23531250","23537430"," these things we have coming up and the best response that i had or that i i had two responses"
"23537430","23544650"," i said well i said if you're along this market let's say you own the underlying you can buy five"
"23544650","23553390"," and 15 cent puts they expire on the 21st of the month they're dirt cheap so if i own a"
"23553390","23561410"," hundred shares of spy let's say and you know like i i can buy some some cheap puts if we"
"23561410","23566130"," go up three dollars you know i'm gonna make 300 bucks or something and i can buy three dollars"
"23566130","23572990"," worth of zero eight puts and heads if you're just trying to trade all of this uh with with nothing"
"23572990","23577030"," on the line right you're trying like hey i'm a seller or hey cap i want to be a buyer"
"23577030","23584810"," whatever that is uh probably heading into today this is a conversation yesterday i was like heading"
"23584810","23592330"," into today and heading into all of this volatility that we are coming into the best trade is likely"
"23592330","23599970"," some kind of a put back ratio spread i fucking love that trade if you are you know if you're"
"23599970","23606390"," that guy and you're like hey i want to take that i want to hedge myself to that downside i"
"23606390","23612530"," want to be able to put something on that i don't get wrecked in if it goes against me or"
"23612530","23619830"," if it doesn't happen until after the end of month let's say it's the first week or second week"
"23619830","23627430"," let's say they pin us into the first of the month of october uh maybe you're looking at that ratio"
"23627430","23632910"," spread right that bearish ratio spread maybe you're putting a couple weeks on extra on it into"
"23632910","23640690"," october um and the the best part of that is of that trade is if you know if you've got"
"23640690","23648710"," that bearish viewpoint and they number one if they pin you here and you don't get that drop until"
"23648710","23657490"," after the first you're gonna make money right and you get out of that 430 420 you want that 400"
"23657490","23662910"," whatever it is that you want uh but the scary part here would be is that you're short and they"
"23662910","23668290"," they line up all these events and they're they're like we're doing this then they squeeze you up"
"23668290","23674350"," every time right they squeeze you up every time and they just put the pain trade on you right and"
"23674350","23679710"," if any of that news goes the bad the wrong way for you if that news ends up being bullish"
"23679710","23686270"," or however it's interpretive it's interpretive bullish you're not off sides with the put back"
"23686270","23692370"," spread with the race the bearish ratio spread if we actually begin to head higher you know if you"
"23692370","23695910"," know i got to tell you guys some i'm gonna warn you right now if you're a seller of this"
"23695910","23703970"," market you need to it's okay if you to be short here for this market but i want to ask"

"25486710","25493290"," production has already stagnated retail and real retail and hotels wholesale trade sales has"
"25493290","25499290"," already stagnated and we're expecting to see a severely negative real retail sales print tomorrow"
"25499290","25504450"," not just because of today's inflation of sticky basis points as it's on the cpi report but we're"
"25504450","25509270"," expecting to see even a negative nominal number of 20 basis points uh so it's going to be a pretty"
"25509270","25515150"," rough one add into that the potential for a uAW strike which would strip out any sort of bright"

"25525170","25530650"," given the fact that we've also seen slowing wage growth you would expect a personal income less"
"25530650","25535070"," transfer payments another one of the six indicators is also going to start showing a bit of"
"25535070","25540750"," weakness and the final one real pce spending given what we're anticipating for real retail sales"
"25540750","25545230"," and tomorrow's number is going to get a bit rough so what's the big takeaway here the big takeaway"
"25545230","25550550"," is that everybody has the soft landing optimism but the cumulative effects of rate tightening is"
"25550550","25554810"," really starting to show up in a bunch of different ways particularly in the six indicators that the"

"26112740","26118620"," the the produced you capture it and you sequester it uh how does it work and does it work well"
"26118620","26124340"," it does work in theory and and in practice in theory it is a very simple thing you take uh"
"26124340","26129980"," you pump the pollution out of like a factory say a steel plant or a coal plant or something like"
"26129980","26135820"," that pumping into one tank combine it with some chemicals that that holds on to the co2 pump that"

"26157760","26163800"," scalable thing that we need so it does it work it works then on a small scale but has anyone"
"26163800","26169280"," been able to do it on a big enough scale that gives uh some confidence that this could be a"
"26169280","26173760"," big thing yeah i mean it depends on how you define big enough i mean we're as Tim mentioned the"
"26173760","26180280"," numbers we're we're pulling like 40 million tons of carbon out of the air right now with this"
"26180280","26185160"," technology so that sounds like a lot but we're pumping 40 billion into the air as we speak and so"
"26185160","26192380"," per year that is and so you've got some there's like a thing in Norway that's pumping like a"
"26192380","26196700"," million tons under the sea that's been doing that for like 20 years this technology has been around"
"26196700","26201440"," a while they're doing that they've been doing that for 20 years to avoid a carbon tax so with with"
"26201440","26206460"," enough financial incentive they they have been trying to ramp up this technology but nobody has"
"26206460","26212280"," done it at the massive scale we need and and we're going to need like 800 million tons a year"
"26212280","26217520"," almost by 2030 if we're going to have any hope of this thing like magically solving our climate"
"26217520","26221520"," change problems why are companies spending so much money on it right now is it a result of"
"26221520","26226540"," governments pushing them to do so that's part of it they're not pushing them like with a stick"
"26226540","26231220"," they're they're luring them with a carrot and so like the the IRA the big climate bill that we"
"26231220","26236780"," passed last year you can get eighty five dollars i think per ton or something for for the carbon"
"26236780","26243620"," that you store which all of a sudden that makes the technology like economic for a lot of these oil"
"26243620","26248560"," companies and they're looking ahead and they're seeing okay you know europe has has a carbon market"
"26248560","26253460"," and they put a pretty substantial price on carbon the u.s is giving you a tax credit and so"
"26253460","26260340"," you can take this this carbon stuffing underground and then say hey you person tim you're burning"
"26260340","26265760"," millions of car tons of carbon you pay me money for as a credit for the carbon that i'm storing"
"26265760","26269580"," underground and all of a sudden you take an oil company that's like it's watching its primary"
"26269580","26274700"," product get you know uh vilified and people are trying to avoid using it all of a sudden it can"
"26274700","26278840"," take its sort of core competency which is drilling into the ground and making holes in the ground"
"26278840","26284280"," and turn that into a new uh revenue line which is like carbon credit storing carbon for other"
"26284280","26289280"," people that everybody wants to do right now is there anything dangerous about putting carbon i was"
"26289280","26293540"," just gonna add i was thinking the same thing as mark describes this it's like getting sent in under"
"26293540","26298920"," the ocean which sounds okay kind of well in the theory until it doesn't work yeah or something like"
"26298920","26303440"," that well that's the thing in theory it makes perfect sense because where all the carbon that we've"
"26303440","26307400"," sucked out of the ground for the past hundred years was underground for millions of years before"
"26307400","26313760"," that so you can theoretically take this stuff and put it underground forever but it's it's easier"
"26313760","26318000"," said than done they've had problems you know this story that that's in bloomberg today which i"
"26318000","26322860"," really recommend it's really interesting uh you know chevron has spent tons of money on this"
"26322860","26327580"," project in australia and they keep having problems with getting the stuff getting enough carbon"
"26327580","26333280"," underground and so they they made these promises they got tax breaks to put the carbon ground they"
"26333280","26337380"," said we'll say this much carbon for you to give us this much tax breaks and they haven't been able"
"26337380","26341680"," to put that much carbon underground so they've had to go out and find other ways by carbon offsets"
"26341680","26349560"," and stuff and so that's one thing uh the danger of it though is is in sort of the process"
"26349560","26354660"," that goes on beyond because when i'm talking about moving carbon into different tanks and they're"
"26354660","26360760"," using chemicals and stuff that also releases uh chemicals you have chemicals that you gas off when"
"26360760","26365500"," you're like isolating carbon the other thing is you have to think about these massive plants take a"
"26365500","26370580"," lot of energy so in some cases you're burning more energy to capture carbon than you are actually"
"26370580","26374640"," capturing the carbon so it's kind of like what are we doing here why don't we just build more EVs"
"26374640","26378340"," or something i mean that's what that's what the environmentalists say and i have to say personally"
"26378340","26383100"," kind of you know there's a little bit of i mean i think we have to keep experimenting with it"
"26383100","26386660"," but as it is right now it kind of feels like maybe we should be doing something else with all"
"26386660","26390400"," this money i don't know well that's a perfect segue to my next question which is you know you write"
"26390400","26394220"," a lot about climate change you write a lot about energy and you write a lot about the solutions to"
"26394220","26398540"," the crisis that we're facing in your opinion you write for bloomberg opinion where does carbon"
"26398540","26404380"," capture fall on these list of solutions i think it could be very high there's all there's this"
"26404380","26410080"," carbon capture and then there's also direct air capture where you just stick a fan or a filter in"
"26410080","26416000"," the air and suck carbon directly out of the air that also has a lot of promise um taking carbon"
"26416000","26421360"," you know planting trees planting swamps all that stuff anything you can do to absorb carbon and put"
"26421360","26427280"," it underground to me is good because at the rate we're going you know we are not really stopping"
"26427280","26433520"," the use of fossil fuels fast enough to avoid more catastrophic climate change and warming having"
"26433520","26437660"," the future beyond net zero yeah exactly we're not going to meet net zero by 2050 at the rate we're"
"26437660","26442180"," going that's why everybody wants that's one reason why some environmentalists do want the carbon"
"26442180","26446500"," capture because you know look it is kind of a magic solution if it works and so i'm all for"
"26446500","26452080"," continuing to experiment with it and and we need to do everything we can so i i wouldn't rule it"
"26452080","26457680"," out uh but it is right now it needs to find some sort of they need to find some sort"
"26457680","26461600"," of magic solution for the magic solution to get it to actually be that all that magic oh but should"
"26461600","26466360"," governments be pouring me 83 billion dollars that they have poured for the last 30 years into"
"26466360","26473140"," supporting subsidizing whatever these projects if you know they don't work i think the one in"
"26473140","26478040"," australia was supposed to capture 80 percent of the carbon dioxide that was emitted and it does"
"26478040","26484520"," less than half i think you know is that a huge use of taxpayer money arguably no because you could"
"26484520","26490080"," argue that they that it is another form of a subsidy subsidy for fossil fuel companies these big"
"26490080","26494180"," oil companies get subsidies in the forms tax breaks and all kinds of stuff this is another thing"
"26494180","26498440"," we're like here we're going to give you all this money to help you find this new business i mean"
"26498440","26503820"," you can argue that they're they're a massive they're they're huge in terms of our economy you know"
"26503820","26508660"," they hire a lot they employ a lot of people they generate a lot of economic activity so we maybe"
"26508660","26512220"," owe it to them to help them out give them a hand and again we're looking for all the climate"
"26512220","26519160"," solutions we can get but we do have to make sure that the the money's being spent wisely 40 seconds"

"28017340","28022700"," bearish on you know on a higher time frame like if I'm looking at a one day chart into end"
"28022700","28028100"," of year I see the role like I see it I don't know that I don't believe that it's right"
"28028100","28034760"," now just yet I do see the role though I see the pause role I see all of it do"
"28034760","28039180"," I think it's right now no I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt to the bulls until trend"
"28039180","28047880"," is broken I have to and you should too even if you're a seller you have to give the bulls"
"28047880","28054120"," to like the last fucking note and I know it sucks to say that but you do the reason you"
"28054120","28059080"," do is because you know what happens you know it would happen in 2020 you know what happened in 2021"
"28059080","28067960"," you know what happened in 2023 you will be wrong 10 times 20 times I was talking to a friend"
"28067960","28077900"," yesterday about a famous seller and this famous seller was assigned to fame"
"28077900","28086680"," for a major market role and he had other Twitter accounts and he had been calling for it's all of"
"28086680","28094540"," 2020 and all 2021 another role down and he was wrong like 30 fucking times he made another account"
"28094540","28103920"," under another name and he got it right you know you're not him I'm not him you're not him you're"
"28103920","28112060"," what you want is not what he wants does that make sense to you so if he's just looking for"
"28112060","28118440"," a little bit of internet fame that's different than you if you're a seller you got to see some shit"
"28118440","28124800"," like you have to see trend get broken to a major trend to the downside you like you need to"
"28124800","28132000"," see let me see that come over here and show you something pink type for a second here uh sorry"
"28132000","28141260"," about that right there so hold on a second here i'm going to show you guys something so this is"
"28141260","28148360"," the uh we're going to go to with the trigger screen here okay and we're going to switch to a"
"28148360","28153400"," day chart and i i got you got to know this if you're a bear you got to know this"
"28153400","28159880"," and you got to trust me on this you can back test this to the beginning of time okay like"
"28159880","28168900"," literally the beginning of the stock market the beginning of the stock market the beginning listen"
"28179110","28188850"," to me closely okay think about that guy watch this orange right here until we get"
"28188850","28198310"," a confirmed break of that orange with this yellow right here right we are not in"
"28198310","28205950"," any kind of risk off any none none i don't care how many times they call it then call it"
"28205950","28212410"," and call it and call it until they're fucking red in the face can't call that shit until price"
"28212410","28218210"," begins or until the yellow line begins to break down underneath here i can't count the number of"
"28218210","28226610"," times that this has not happened okay and it's it's like hundreds over the past couple years like"
"28226610","28233030"," two three years even with the down year last year if you look at it over like ten years or"
"28233030","28242850"," 30 years or a hundred years it's thousands of times thousands so so the so the the chance"
"28242850","28248830"," for you calling it is not on your side does that make sense it's not on your side it never"
"28248830","28254930"," has been it never will be so if you want to be that top collar you wait until that happens"
"28254930","28259650"," and you you call the top and say hey we crossed the yellow line is over the over not even"
"28259650","28266430"," now you can it's the moment that happens you can say we're in a crash risk warning here okay and"
"28266430","28271430"," then when you start to call the actual crash uh when you start to call that actual crash you"
"28271430","28276490"," actually break trend and that's below that monthly right there see that big month right here this"
"28276490","28289240"," is when when you get an actual cross watch me closely here when you get with"
"28289240","28298990"," that cross right there right you get that crossing down right there and you"
"28298990","28303870"," break that blue line right there this it so you've got i'm gonna give you three examples say this"
"28303870","28312290"," this is for anytime okay um you get the you get the pullback right so this is the i'm going"
"28312290","28322090"," to show you the pullback so here's the pullback right here's the correction right here's the crash"
"28322090","28331750"," warning right crash warning and this is the actual crash right here so so"
"28331750","28337210"," this is where you start saying we are crashing this is where you start saying we are in a crash"
"28337210","28343930"," warning right and when you see this cross here right to that cross that orange line um that's"
"28343930","28349870"," really bad but if that yellow line even if price goes down there listen me closely too so let's say"
"28349870","28355710"," you have a price go down here but the yellow line does not cross that's not a crash warning that's"
"28355710","28362550"," just a correction okay um and and we've been buying time in this market over the past four or five"
"28362550","28367290"," weeks right where where instead of getting your big old move down to the downside for a correction"
"28367290","28373410"," you didn't get it you didn't get it back here and as time is passing uh the bite in your"
"28373410","28381530"," in your correction is becoming less and less right time passes and the toothiness of your downside"
"28381530","28388870"," expectation is very low so when you get this you'll be able to see it and understand the concepts"
"28388870","28396150"," that i'm telling you so like i have to give the bull the last benefit of the doubt is the"
"28396150","28399950"," point that i'm making to you i don't want to give it to the fucking bulls because the bulls are"
"28399950","28405590"," on fucking page 10 or like the last fucking chapter the last few pages of their book they don't"
"28405590","28410490"," have a lot of time left and a lot of pages left in their narrative but until that happens right"
"28410490","28416130"," i'm not going to give the narrative to a bear until that happens if and when that happens it's the"
"28416130","28419890"," fucking bear's book they're going to write to start writing a book you're going to write 10"
"28419890","28424870"," chapters and from that point you're going to then get bearish you know and if you want to get"
"28424870","28434550"," bearish like truly bearish uh you have so much time after this all happens here"
"28434550","28442190"," you know you didn't need any of this to take on that narrative and you didn't need any of this"
"28442190","28449030"," to make money because the big money is down here and you know you know they're wrong so fucking"
"28449030","28455450"," much it it's it's so fucked up it's not fucked up it's that you don't know what everyone else's"
"28455450","28460070"," motivation is or what they're why they're saying it or what they're looking for and that kind of"
"28460070","28465990"," stuff so i if you want to know if i'm bearish on like a higher time frame much higher sure"
"28465990","28470690"," i see the market slowing down i see this happening right here i know that we're coming into"
"28470690","28478110"," volatility good and bad as we reach up into those previous eyes back from january of 2022 so i get"
"28478110","28483110"," that i get it's going to be volatile do i think that this is the top i don't yet uh"
"28483110","28488530"," so the bulls have not given up that narrative yet i do will they i don't know if they do"
"28488530","28493930"," uh i'll know what to do though if they give up that narrative we start breaking through that yellow"
"28493930","28497450"," line breaks through the orange line the orange line breaks through the blue line and prices heading"
"28497450","28502430"," down with it yeah fuck yeah i'll get bearish uh but i warn you man i'm some of you guys"
"28502430","28507710"," are new traders new investors this is a fair fucking warning to you they are wrong do these people"
"28507710","28515670"," are wrong wrong wrong like hundreds of times hundreds uh don't get caught don't drink that kool-aid"
"28515670","28520970"," i've been there i've drank that kool-aid don't fucking do it don't fucking do it until it happens"
"28520970","28526390"," you can slam the sell button afterwards but do not slam that sell button before uh on that big"
"28526390","28532110"," macro picture uh if they if they're gonna if they're gonna bullshit us with that scam like ire for"
"28532110","28537950"," longer i heard that on on that uh bloomberg radio today those numbers couldn't be any better for"
"28537950","28542610"," the market to go higher trust me any better the more they make you believe that they're gonna"
"28542610","28548190"," continue to make or raise rates right and do what they're supposed to do this market will trade"
"28548190","28554590"," sideways and up through that not the whole but a whole bunch of that process um so i know that"
"28554590","28560370"," it's not i know that you want to hear like uh you know i know you want to hear like"
"28560370","28567050"," this is bad news today this morning but it really isn't uh your bad news is when we're down into"
"28567050","28573270"," that two percent inflation that's when the bad news comes historically and the unemployment rate"
"28573270","28579210"," will be higher at that point as well uh so when that happens i'd be getting fucking bearish you"
"28579210","28583170"," know i'd be getting really fucking bearish uh and i realize people want to front right too i"
"28583170","28589690"," realize that i realize that a seller can begin to front run this news and they'll eventually be"
"28589690","28595510"," right in six months i realize that we're coming into uh traditionally week part of the year it's"
"28595510","28599710"," like time for a dance and all that kind of stuff but you as uh you as a market participant"
"28599710","28604790"," i want you to just not drink that fucking Kool-Aid yet please don't drink that Kool-Aid yet there"
"28604790","28611370"," is a time to drink that Kool-Aid when that time comes uh when that when that roll happens you"
"28611370","28617130"," in you're a fucking bull get your fucking bear suits on uh i warn you of that too when that"
"28617130","28621570"," happens when you see that what i drew for you when you see that happen i don't want to listen"
"28621570","28626370"," to a bull uh like i'll listen to you for like a squeeze or something but as far as that's"
"28626370","28630950"," going down or selling down or that's the big role we're looking for i'm not gonna want to hear it"
"28630950","28635290"," from a fucking bull i will fucking ban you if you're a bull doing that shit in my stream like"
"28635290","28639290"," what like i ban the bears i will come after you i'll be like fuck you you're out right not"
"28639290","28642690"," on a squeeze or anything but like you're trying to tell me we're gonna flip back around that kind"
"28642690","28647690"," of shit uh uh that we usually go down right but i think 90 percent of time we go down"
"28647690","28655050"," if that happens so so i'll say on that topic it'd be like on that topic of like time frames"
"28655050","28659070"," for bullish bearishness uh so i see it down the road i see what you're saying if you're a bear"
"28659070","28667430"," uh on a shorter time frame uh have to give that narrative to the to the bulls right that they're"
"28667430","28675110"," still alive that sucks but they're still alive uh and i told sellers already this morning i said do"
"28675110","28680810"," not get caught these fucking dealers will pin this shit accumulate all that news and then maybe"
"28680810","28686190"," roll it afterwards and another scary part of that is if any of that news as a whole begins to"
"28686190","28690630"," make this shit squeeze and we're heading into the end of the month they will run this shit right up"
"28690630","28694490"," into that trigger they will pin that shit right in the end of the month it'll make your head spin"
"28694490","28700750"," if you're a seller so just be sober as a seller i get what you're looking for as a seller"
"28700750","28706790"," i know you're looking for the roll over i understand you're getting there you are getting there but"
