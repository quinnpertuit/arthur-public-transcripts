"103270","105110"," Joe, another pizzy day."
"105850","107750"," They're allowed to get through the corner this morning. "
"108010","111610"," I came in and said, excuse me, if that's what I want, I'm going to use a super investor."
"111910","112970"," I said, dude, come on in."
"115530","117550"," Everybody's rolling in here right now, right now, right on. "

"126510","127430"," One-and-a-half million dollars."
"127430","132710"," I see a few research LRCX introducing a suite of selectors."
"133050","133650"," I'll put that at this one. "
"133710","135950"," We'll keep selling the four-wheeler, three-wheeler roadmaps."
"136610","137190"," We'll move through."
"137190","138730"," One more trial, the X-ray. "
"141180","142740"," All right, here we go."
"143980","145060"," I'm going to switch over."
"145200","146500"," Good morning, Benny Mack. "
"148850","152250"," All right, we've got a lot to get through this morning, so if you're just tuning in."

"162190","166210"," When I mute this because we got a ton to get through this morning, and especially if you're holding"
"166210","170570"," short and anything like that, I want to talk to you guys about that as well this morning."
"173220","174540"," We've got a ton to get through."
"176660","177420"," How's everybody doing?"
"178220","180220"," Good morning, BTCC KK. "
"180820","182040"," More in Teagan, how are you?"
"182820","184040"," We got a lot to get through this morning."
"185120","186860"," I want to make sure they get everything correct."
"187720","191280"," All right, so we're going to start with the economic calendar today. "
"193940","194960"," Bread on Bloodstun."
"195080","196300"," Bloodstun just a heads up too."
"196600","201060"," On today's economic calendar, it's not listed on this calendar, but we also have oil inventories, I"
"201060","203700"," believe at 10, 11 o'clock. "
"203980","207800"," So be careful with your trading in oil this morning."
"207980","208700"," Good morning, Kari."
"208940","209580"," Good morning, Daniel. "
"210320","216780"," Yeah, be careful with the oil trade between them around 10, 30, 11 o'clock comes out."
"216880","218680"," I always forget what time it is on Wednesdays."
"219180","220120"," Good morning, Jake, you. "
"220520","222240"," All right, so we got to get some roll in real quick."
"222440","224980"," Maybe really fast about this economic calendar for today."
"225920","230600"," We've got wholesale inventories, a revision at 10 a.m. We've got a couple of Fed speakers today. "
"231700","236320"," Where we are in the market, it could be impactful around that 10, 30, and 12."
"237000","238920"," Other than that, it's a pretty smooth day, right?"
"239280","246770"," We've got CPI coming in tomorrow morning, and you know that there'll be volatility with that."
"248710","255310"," Now, you know, if if volatility comes in at what the expectation is, might be known, right?"
"255570","259070"," So the market might take that hit, let it roll over. "
"259269","266950"," But last night at the close, we had at 4 p.m. A huge hedge welcome in after after 4"
"266950","273210"," p.m. And IWM, that might be something to do with the CPI report coming out on Thursday."
"274610","277910"," It was a bad time to put it in, of course, but I'm going to be aware of that as"
"277910","278110"," well."
"279710","281770"," And so Thursday is a big day for us, right?"
"281870","285270"," We also at the end of today have a lot of big tech earnings. "
"285890","286750"," I want to show you that."
"287150","293050"," And like yesterday, we didn't really have too many heavy hitters that banks aren't in, but we also"
"293050","296970"," know that, uh, uh, excuse me, reports like Walt Disney."
"297630","300130"," We know Walt Disney always is a scam trade, right?"
"300550","303910"," We know that you have to buy the clothes and then sell it right at the bell on the open. "
"304350","306670"," You have to take long trades in Disney."
"307230","308170"," Proopers, another one."
"308310","314570"," We've got Twilio, Zinga, uh, wouldn't worry too much about Mattel and Sonos, but MGM Resorts is"
"314570","315270"," another big one. "
"315830","317410"," Well, Riley is usually a pretty safe trade."
"318050","320810"," We'll also have some positioning for Twitter on Thursday."
"321670","326670"," And then we've got a data dog, the dog food company on Thursday at the open. "
"327310","329610"," Many of you guys didn't know that data dog does dog food."
"330250","334370"," And, uh, we've got some other, uh, biotech kind of stuff in here."
"334450","338050"," Yeah, I was going to call it should tame the market. "
"338410","343910"," And the one other good thing though, about the reports today after the bell."
"343910","349630"," And I believe even Thursday as we've got a couple hundred almost, I want to, I want to say it"
"349630","352450"," somewhere between anywhere from 150 to 200 per day right now."
"352450","357630"," So there should be some stability, uh, in the market the next couple of days at the end, at the"
"357630","362170"," end of the day and tomorrow, but still there are some heavy hitters in here that people get"
"362170","364490"," aggressive with as we head into the end of the day today. "
"365690","369710"," Now I'm going to go through the spot gamma report as well this morning for you."
"370010","372990"," And I'm going to give you something I want to talk to you about what my take on the market"
"372990","374210"," at before where we are this morning."
"375150","376870"," Just going to read it off together this morning real quick. "
"376990","381690"," We've got a huge as a push higher to 45, 45 model still show up here about volatility potential"
"381690","382050"," today."
"382450","388970"," So the one day implied a move of 1.2 points or 1.26 percent, which is quite high."
"389530","395530"," Now the SP 500 spent the back half of yesterday's session pin to that large by 450 line 45 20"
"395530","396230"," for SPX. "
"396290","399730"," We now see this area as a key support as above the strike."
"399950","404770"," We're in positive gamma should creep in, evoking support of daily flows as per Monday's note, put"
"404770","409530"," wall metric has shifted to 100 handles higher, which has been correlated to rallies in the market."
"410090","414270"," Now the put wall metric means the wall has come up from a lower level, right?"
"414690","419330"," We know that it was much, much lower was down around 40, 40, 40, 400. "
"420490","430110"," Then we've got a 460 spy and 4600 spy SPX is the target area above and based on indicative E"
"430110","434110"," S price is 45 45 in our volatility forecast 1.2 percent."
"434530","439190"," And once once their deviation move that 4600 area pairs achievable today."
"439530","443650"," I want you to think about this real quick, okay, is when we look at the charts this morning, I"
"443650","448310"," want you to realize that even if we tag 4600, there's a fair chance that we're either going to sell"
"448310","452610"," down off the bell and then head up to 4600 or if we tag 4600 that we're going to sell"
"452610","453570"," off from there as well. "
"454030","455550"," But just be conscious of that today."
"456110","457430"," I think it's slightly lower."
"457570","462490"," I think it's like 45 85 or something. "
"462710","463950"," I don't think it's quite at 46."
"464210","467750"," If everybody knows that 4600, there will be sellers at some point."
"467750","470930"," There's also going to be some bulls that are going to want to get in and they're not going to"
"470930","473750"," want to buy the bell and trade it straight up. "
"473790","475310"," They're going to be looking for a dip, right?"
"475730","479990"," You're also going to have overnight holders that are going to want to sell their positions to take"
"479990","480350"," profit."
"480650","485290"," Not everybody, but just be conscious of that if we green bar it straight up, there's a fair chance"
"485290","487450"," that we're going to ricochet off, okay?"
"487950","493130"," And the second issue would be do sellers come in before we even get to 4600, right?"
"493610","498090"," Do we get to 45 or 85 or something like that or even near there?"
"498550","499170"," And we sell off."
"499270","500290"," Look at the charts here in just a minute. "
"500710","501710"," We're only to be aware of that."
"501850","506710"," And then for such a heavy move up from last night, there's a fair chance that we sell right at"
"506710","507090"," the bell."
"507750","512850"," There was a supportive green bar in pre-market with a green tail on it. "
"512950","518630"," And typically we red bar it down off those in previous trading sessions over time."
"519049","521570"," Just be conscious of that as we head into the open this morning."
"523130","524950"," We also got more for you guys. "
"525130","526870"," We also had 360 and QUs."
"527710","531010"," As an important level as it appears to be above the strike, we're in composition is pick up."
"532470","536130"," Our general feeling here is that the market has found balance at 4,500. "
"536750","539290"," I also want you guys to have these key numbers, okay?"
"539730","542030"," On your charts 4,600, I would go lower."
"542590","547110"," We'll show it on another chart here, 45, 34, 44, 75, right?"
"547250","550450"," We know that the support is 45, 45."
"551350","553410"," You can always pause this video, come back. "
"553590","555950"," Our general feeling here is that the market has found balance at 4,500."
"556590","559870"," It needs a push to invoke the next options-based feedback loop."
"560490","565530"," It is above that 45, 20 is the SPX vault trigger, right?"
"566330","568730"," Now we view the upside loop as having more edge. "
"569450","574530"," If the S&P can push up at a 4,600, that should further drag, realize volatility lower, which in"
"574530","576850"," turn can drag down implied volatility."
"577550","579650"," Lower implied volatility suggests the advantage rate persists."
"579650","581710"," As it's a part of tailwind. "
"582130","586530"," Okay, so their point is that if we get to 4,600, we shouldn't ricochet off, we should trade higher."
"586910","592370"," That note does, though, lend some credence to us red-biring it down, finding more buyers and"
"592370","594330"," support data, push us up to 4,600."
"595070","598290"," And then if we stick around at 4,600, we should continue the advantage rate on. "
"599530","604370"," So this feels like it is becoming a pain trade for put holders, too, as days pass without a"
"604370","608770"," material downside move, those puts lose value, which builds supportive flows for markets."
"608770","610850"," I want to give you a key here, okay?"
"612190","619130"," We've been talking about day in, day out here, that we talked about coming up to 4,560, 4,585,"
"620170","621170"," somewhere in there."
"621510","626490"," And if we were to move to 4,600, that we need to trade past 4,600. "
"626730","630550"," If we do not, we will trade down, okay?"
"630710","632270"," And we will test lower lows."
"632930","640230"," I still have put spreads on at 4,200, and no, yeah, 4,200, I don't know what I'll check"
"640230","644810"," what they are, but they're like 44, or 44, 0, and 44, 2."
"645250","651030"," I've got put spreads dated for February 18th, and I'm sweating on those put spreads right now."
"651230","655430"," Even though I'm trading the market up, I'm still holding those as a hedge, and those hedges remain"
"655430","656130"," in the market. "
"656510","660510"," And that's one of the keys why we're heading up right now, is that all of us are hedged out"
"660510","664070"," there, and none of us are adding to that hedging."
"664070","668310"," So everybody in the market right now is hedged to the tits, everybody."
"668810","673850"," Everybody's got a fucking hedge on across the fucking market, but nobody's adding into that hedge. "
"674490","679450"," And so as those hedges are decaying into February, some people are rolling into March, and even"
"679450","684890"," yesterday rolling into May, but there's no additional put flow."
"685290","687330"," And as a point as well, right?"
"687510","688890"," There's no real call flow either."
"689490","690470"," That's way outside of the money. "
"690650","693710"," We saw some of the past few days outside of the money, further down the road."
"694110","701250"," We've seen banks buying calls on specific tickers into June, July, targeting specific stocks, but"
"701250","704330"," you don't have the market wide jump endpoint."
"704590","710150"," There was a jump endpoint yesterday, if you noticed into the bell yesterday, and we didn't sell"
"710150","710450"," off. "
"710450","714470"," And we traded down yesterday, and I said, hey, I'm buying this into the bell, right?"
"714650","720270"," We did get that kick in of banks buying us into the bell last night."
"720510","725430"," Now, there's another thing to consider today, and that is a short squeeze for shorts wanting to"
"725430","730170"," jump in immediately to trade this down, because the shorts are getting fucked this morning."
"730610","732010"," No matter what, they're getting fucked. "
"732650","736590"," So they're going to either have to flip the long off the bell and trade us higher, or they're going"
"736590","739530"," to have to triple down to try to get back their money."
"740250","741790"," So I wanted to realize that as well."
"741930","743510"," The banks are more than likely not short any longer. "
"743510","748350"," It's more than likely retail traders that are upside down if they're short this market overnight."
"749650","753630"," Now, do you want to be aware of this, though, because when we open today and we trade up to"
"753630","756030"," the 4600, this is a place where you can get trapped."
"756230","759710"," This is a place where people will sell their puts, they'll sell their protection. "
"760410","762190"," They're going to get really super uber duper bullish."
"762930","764750"," Now, they're going to say we're going to 4800, right?"
"765090","766370"," And boom, that's where it happens."
"766610","771710"," Okay, the more bullish that you get, the more disregard you have for the market, that's usually"
"771710","772410"," where there's a turn. "
"772730","774250"," I'm not going to close my hedging."
"774670","779650"," I'd rather see them die into the 18th and trust this market, or banks right now."
"779650","783550"," We're not above, we haven't broken our channel yet. "
"783910","785770"," We haven't made all time highs yet."
"786090","788490"," We're not even in this phase of being bullish."
"788710","794770"," Now, I'm bullish here after 4600, but I just wanted to be aware that where we are, right, is still"
"794770","799090"," a place where you should not be complacent to where we are and where we're heading right now. "
"799470","800890"," Not a time to be complacent."
"801470","807370"," And one more thing is that bears know that they can attempt to jump in here this morning at 930"
"807370","808830"," and try to trade this down."
"808830","810930"," Do I think we're going to trade down at the bell?"
"811230","811670"," I don't know. "
"811990","816270"," I don't know if you should take profit at the bell or continue to let it ride up."
"816570","818170"," I'm not going to make that decision for you."
"818910","823630"," I'll tell you that I'm more than likely going to take my money off the table right at 930. "
"823950","826850"," I'm going to take my profits and look for another buy-in-hire."
"827190","832390"," If I miss the trade from the bell to 4600 or just below 4600, I'm just going to wait for"
"832390","833690"," it for the next trade to go higher."
"834850","837150"," So I don't know what to say to you on that. "
"837150","841730"," If you're a bull that didn't buy the clothes yesterday and you're looking to get in, it's tough to"
"841730","843250"," say because it's going to be the Wild West."
"843470","848730"," If you buy for a green bar straight up, that's possible that we can green bar it straight up."
"848950","851810"," I think I'm going to give that a chance of 35 percent. "
"852250","855710"," I'm going to give us a 65 percent chance that we red bar it down and then we're going to"
"855710","856410"," get another lift up."
"857210","857330"," Okay."
"857710","859450"," Just be conscious of that this morning. "
"860610","862270"," I'm going to be careful of that this morning."
"865010","866370"," The calls are over reading."
"867510","868610"," And you can buy both. "
"868790","872010"," The other thing you could do is just buy some calls off the bell, right?"
"872450","876210"," And if we start to burn to get some more support, you can roll them into a bigger position."
"876830","878490"," So there's two parts to this, right?"
"879050","885470"," You can pick, let's say you get 460s off the bell and let's say you start off with like 10"
"885470","885890"," percent."
"887510","889230"," This isn't your whole bank, okay?"
"889710","891430"," Like let's say you're going to spend $10,000. "
"891430","897610"," You could buy $1,000 in zero dates and then scale in, right?"
"897790","899830"," Add another thousand, another thousand, another thousand."
"900110","903910"," If you have the bullish point of view, that we're going to 460 today, right?"
"904130","908810"," And then you eventually scale down to where, if you missed that first grip up, you're able to add"
"908810","916010"," on the way back down to make your dollar cost average on calls heavy and cheap, okay?"
"916250","919290"," So if you're only getting one of the thousand bucks and we go straight to 46 hundred, you're going"
"919290","919970"," to make a lot of money."
"920610","924910"," If you start to burn that down, who cares because you're going to add another nine grand as we head"
"924910","926070"," down for the next rep or higher. "
"926430","931010"," Now that is the view point to the market this morning for most people out there."
"931210","936350"," I would be careful though, I would be careful of these bulls out there that are telling you we're"
"936350","940750"," going all-time high, so we're going to go here and go there because these are bulls that are"
"940750","944190"," jumping in at the end, not before, okay?"
"945010","949310"," They haven't been trading this up past a few days and so I just want you to be careful of"
"949310","949510"," that."
"950130","951370"," As we move forward, hold on. "
"954390","958990"," So just, you know, if you're in before everybody else, you don't need to have as much risk as"
"958990","959550"," everybody else."
"959550","961430"," You can wait for pullbacks to trade it higher."
"962230","964370"," So that's all I've got for SPACama over here. "
"964690","968530"," I'll scroll through this in case you guys want to see some key levels and support so you can always"
"968530","970070"," pause this video and come back to it."
"971810","976750"," And you know SPACama, I love SPACama, but sometimes they'll come back with, hey, remember we talked"
"976750","977470"," about this the other day?"
"977850","979870"," They give you two options almost every day."
"980450","985050"," I don't know how familiar you guys are with SPACama, but they can sometimes have a lean towards one"
"985050","990990"," way, but then the day turns out different and then you'll come back and say, look, we told you the"
"990990","992850"," chances of this happening, okay?"
"993410","994970"," I want you to get this nice bounce over here. "
"995350","996850"," Got a nice another bounce over here."
"997170","1001170"," You're going to probably look for another bounce at some point here to see how we're trading in"
"1001170","1002770"," this huge vanitrade right here."
"1003190","1006290"," Either you're going to hear bull said we're going to vanitrade this up for another one, two, three"
"1006290","1006530"," days. "
"1006910","1007510"," It's possible."
"1007670","1008710"," I'm not saying that we can't, okay?"
"1008710","1013970"," But I want you to see right here, right in this just this trading range right here that we're on"
"1013970","1015210"," the highest side of this trading range."
"1015730","1017590"," It'd be nothing for us to trade down. "
"1017910","1021790"," You've got the support level here at 45-40."
"1023270","1025010"," That's from SPACama as well, right?"
"1026010","1028970"," These are the same bars we've had here for days."
"1029950","1031530"," You've got another support down here. "
"1031730","1035290"," This was the closing bell at 45-45-85."
"1036190","1042690"," You've got another support level down here at 447.47, so 447.50, I guess."
"1043290","1048070"," And you've got another one way back down here, 4400 still, still hanging out down here. "
"1048150","1051930"," And then I've got this other little line over here to this bottom and this bottom right here."
"1051930","1057430"," It kind of meets up to this 447.47. So just know as a bull, if you're like, I'm buying"
"1057430","1058170"," this open, right?"
"1058350","1059510"," And you're going to go 100% in."
"1059630","1063530"," And if we trade down, and let's say your bank is 10 grand and you're like, well, I'm going to"
"1063530","1064790"," go in 10 grand right here. "
"1065150","1066910"," If we trade down, you're fucked."
"1066910","1071450"," Like there ain't no, you ain't getting out of it, even if we hit 4,600 above, okay?"
"1071850","1073510"," You're fucked, you're going to be fucked in your calls."
"1073770","1077290"," So be conscious and be deliberate in your trading today, okay?"
"1077890","1082070"," Now, if you'd only put 1,000 bucks in, you're going to make a reasonable profit as we trade higher,"
"1082370","1082450"," right?"
"1082910","1087770"," I'm going to put this 4,600 up here and just want you to see where this volatility is, okay?"
"1088330","1089190"," I want to show you why. "
"1089530","1091210"," So the price target above is 4,600."
"1091810","1096730"," Well, we've got 45-7.54, right?"
"1096730","1097650"," This is a previous."
"1098090","1100530"," I'm going to go to a bigger time frame here. "
"1102370","1106690"," So this first resistance here is the prior high, right?"
"1107010","1108630"," So we remember that one there, right?"
"1109030","1109870"," And then 4,600."
"1110570","1112190"," I'm going to show you that other one right here."
"1112690","1115050"," The 4,600 right is right in here. "
"1115130","1119590"," This is where this level of support was right here before we start to make a huge dropdown."
"1119590","1124190"," So this is that volatility zone before we get back into positive gamma, okay?"
"1124190","1128470"," So even the other part of the price target up here, 4,600, I'm going to doubt that we actually"
"1128470","1129330"," get that high."
"1129490","1132010"," I'm not going to take this trade as a bull higher. "
"1132190","1133670"," That's going to let the banks do it for me."
"1134110","1137630"," Let them settle us above here, and then I'll take that trade higher from there."
"1137970","1140350"," The last key point is you see this white line right here?"
"1140750","1142290"," I want to show you this white line right here, okay?"
"1142370","1147690"," This is another critical juncture to be scared of, honestly be scared of because this is major"
"1147690","1151350"," resistance going back to all-time highs, okay?"
"1151870","1156970"," And until you break through this, and typically when you break through this on any corrective move"
"1156970","1161370"," on a stock, you typically trade above this and you'll trade sideways and then make your move"
"1161370","1162570"," higher, okay?"
"1162670","1163270"," Almost always. "
"1163610","1168190"," Not every time, but I'm telling you, like 99% of the time, that typically happens when you hit that"
"1168190","1168990"," zone, okay?"
"1169470","1174270"," And we're going to look at that resistance that's right here, okay?"
"1174950","1175790"," I just want to show you this."
"1177210","1178770"," I want to show you this one more time, okay?"
"1178830","1181610"," No matter what anybody's telling you out there, my spot gamma's telling you out there."
"1181610","1184530"," I want you to see that right even just in here, okay?"
"1184950","1186930"," You are going to see resistance here. "
"1186950","1188670"," We're not even at 4,600 yet."
"1189050","1190590"," Be conscious of this, okay?"
"1191210","1196750"," That when we hit this area, this zone here, that this confluence is going to matter."
"1197390","1200410"," No matter what you think, it's going to matter today, I promise, okay?"
"1202550","1204130"," All right, looking for penny puts. "
"1206470","1210090"," But P-time predictions was way off the one day, Monday I said Thursday news and come out that P "
"1210090","1211270","-time is not going to be by by somebody."
"1212610","1213430"," Sell the rips, yeah."
"1213650","1215070"," This is, we're still not. "
"1215490","1217350"," I just want to be, I want you to be careful, okay?"
"1217430","1220450"," In this corrective trade, I want to show you something else."
"1220630","1222690"," I want to show you guys one other thing here, okay?"
"1223210","1224170"," And this is the bear case."
"1224430","1227170"," There's a couple different bear cases here, okay?"
"1227610","1228930"," I want to show you the other bear case. "
"1229190","1234070"," There's like two still left to play out that have, or you don't have or haven't played out yet."
"1234630","1235350"," It's already 919."
"1235530","1238210"," I'm going to do one more bear case for you. "
"1239090","1240910"," I just want to show you, okay?"
"1242310","1247150"," For all of you out there that are bullish right now, this is the, this is when times get really"
"1247150","1247910"," scary, okay?"
"1248350","1249270"," It's right here, okay?"
"1249390","1252010"," It's just one big move down, two, right?"
"1252410","1257030"," You have this nice big fake out up here, and then what you end up doing is just trading down"
"1257030","1258590"," into March, okay?"
"1259290","1260750"," I just want you to be careful of this."
"1261370","1263310"," Okay, this correction right here, this happens."
"1263790","1265890"," This happened to Tesla, okay?"
"1265890","1270890"," You just, you get that, like we're going places and then boom, we get fucked. "
"1271410","1275250"," So if you're a bull, this is a place where bears are going to want to step in."
"1275590","1279090"," Even if we're trading higher this morning, you'd bump up and then all of a sudden it's all the"
"1279090","1280810"," news, shitty CPI numbers."
"1281490","1284270"," Fucking them up, I don't think Ukraine's going to invade, but you know, there's any kind of"
"1284270","1289250"," bullshit they can bring up to you that'll make the news make us sell off. "
"1289630","1293450"," So just consider this as a bull, can you handle if we do this, okay?"
"1293450","1299110"," Are you hedged for, this is why I'm not selling my puts, because this right here, if this happens,"
"1299690","1302550"," and I'm just long in the market, right?"
"1303070","1304230"," This would kick me out of the market."
"1304730","1305890"," This would do some damage."
"1306110","1310270"," If I'm in for like 20, 30% of my account, and we start going down this one, I started"
"1310270","1315170"," venting this back up here, I could get, I could get burned like bad. "
"1315850","1319150"," So just be conscious of this as we trade higher here."
"1319570","1323870"," Have your, not your blinders on, but you'd be thinking about what everybody is telling you and"
"1323870","1325410"," talking to you about in social media."
"1325910","1330010"," Do not trust CNBC, do not trust anything in the news. "
"1330770","1335530"," You're informed, you know where we're going, you know what's up, and you trade accordingly, okay?"
"1336290","1341510"," If you're going to trade this today, you're going to keep trading this today, right?"
"1341950","1345530"," The safest bet as a bull is to, you don't need the entire trade."
"1345650","1349490"," If we trade up here, right, you can wait for us to build support here and take this trade higher."
"1349490","1352930"," You've got all this space up here to take it to 480. "
"1353450","1357590"," I don't think we're trading over 480, but you've got all this room to make tons of money."
"1357930","1359610"," Just look back on a year, right?"
"1360090","1361670"," So where we are at a year, right?"
"1362110","1362670"," Look at a year."
"1363290","1365950"," We're basically, we're basically right here. "
"1367110","1369250"," And you've got all this room to make money up here."
"1369610","1375890"," So don't get over like super uber duper fucking bullish, like just don't, because this is way, if"
"1375890","1378350"," it fails, it gives us huge drop we had."
"1378350","1382190"," It is easy for you to lose context of where we truly are. "
"1382590","1385310"," I mean, look at where we are right here, right?"
"1385430","1387930"," We're like, we're literally like right here."
"1388430","1389190"," This is where we are."
"1389410","1393130"," That doesn't mean we don't trade higher, but it means we've got a ton more room to keep trading"
"1393130","1395350"," higher if you're a super duper bullish, okay?"
"1395690","1400430"," If you're not super duper bullish, then you have to be measured in your attack to all time highs"
"1400430","1401930"," and then look for rejection. "
"1402970","1404270"," Look for us to keep trading sideways."
"1405130","1407930"," Take your profit as we trade and move forward, okay?"
"1409770","1410770"," You guys got all this?"
"1410870","1412030"," You guys understand all this, right?"
"1412290","1414110"," Yeah, this is all Fib retracements."
"1414350","1415990"," Everything I got here is Fib retracements. "
"1416530","1418610"," I do Fib retracements in all of my charting."
"1419170","1421430"," I use volume profile, market profile."
"1422710","1424550"," I'm using, I use Elliott Wave counts. "
"1425390","1427870"," I just don't show you guys everything, okay?"
"1428550","1432590"," We can do all that shit together, but you guys have seen me do Fib retracements actually on this"
"1432590","1432870"," channel."
"1433390","1434790"," You guys have seen me do Fib retracements."
"1435490","1438790"," I did one this past week for you guys live, I think, on ES, right?"
"1439710","1441010"," I'm almost positive I have a fit. "
"1441130","1442110"," My effect is probably still there."
"1442330","1442990"," I'm not going to do it now."
"1443070","1446770"," It's 9.22, but I'll show you the Fib retracement I've got on ES on Trading View. "
"1447090","1448250"," You guys have seen it already in the past."
"1448710","1450650"," Just be conscious of where we are, okay?"
"1451170","1453370"," Don't get blindsided and be like, I didn't know."
"1453730","1457990"," Captain, tell me, I only heard what I wanted to hear this morning, but not what I needed to hear. "
"1458510","1463350"," Okay, so you guys, sometimes you guys pay attention and then sometimes you guys are like, he didn't"
"1463350","1464510"," say this, right?"
"1464730","1466530"," So make sure that you know both sides of this trade."
"1466530","1468970"," Make sure you know what could happen inside of this trade."
"1469190","1470470"," There's another little line here. "
"1470490","1472550"," Do you guys want to post this to Twitter for you?"
"1472830","1475430"," Do you guys have a better view point or vantage point?"
"1476910","1482050"," If where I think the real rejection is is up here and what I'm really looking for for us to"
"1482050","1484870"," get up to that 4,600, I can post that for if you want."
"1486030","1490890"," Hey guys, I've seen on Mondays and Sundays or Mondays, I always do the volume profile for you guys."
"1491350","1495490"," At least one day a week, I'll show you the Elliott Wave stuff or the Fibonacci retracements. "
"1495490","1497130"," Don't do the counts for you guys."
"1497930","1500930"," And then you guys see the book map."
"1501230","1507770"," So I do traditional charting, I layer that with volume profile, market profile, and then I use"
"1507770","1513050"," Elliott Wave counts and also I'll use the retracements like kind of shit. "
"1513990","1516410"," Okay, and then we finish it up with book map."
"1516950","1523570"," Options flow, the dome, market sentiment, trading sentiment, investor sentiment, and then the news"
"1523570","1524310"," of course, right?"
"1524310","1525810"," We're now we're trading with the news every day."
"1526610","1531010"," So I hope you guys, any guys that bought, oh, we say I want, any guys that bought last night,"
"1531150","1531510"," congratulations. "
"1533630","1539570"," I'm going to turn this off here and get the book map up and running for us this morning."
"1540710","1546070"," And we'll get to trade the news back on for you and we know we can hear the open net"
"1546070","1547530"," loss of 90 million euro."
"1549690","1551850"," Hey guys, what do you want me to go off India trading in Milan?"
"1553450","1555890"," Yeah, we keep faces like hells, no. "
"1556730","1562160"," Yeah, we do spot cam."
"1562340","1567340"," We also layer the, we also layer spot cam in there with, you know, negative positive gamer, not"
"1567340","1568260"," really negative and positive."
"1569060","1571240"," And then we layer in vaults, 30 levels as well. "
"1571440","1576120"," So we've got, we got a lot of levels going on here for layers to where we think we are"
"1576120","1576980"," when we think we're going."
"1578480","1580100"," You guys tracking all this this morning?"
"1584690","1586630"," You guys, you guys tracking all this this morning?"
"1593450","1596290"," You guys tracking everything, everybody okay out there this morning?"
"1596650","1599170"," And you guys, are you guys long with it from last night?"
"1599550","1603590"," You know, we know we talked about buying it right before the bell and then we talked about buying"
"1603590","1605310"," it again after the bell."
"1605650","1607590"," We only had a few minutes left to go long. "
"1608510","1612710"," Did any guys follow me into that trade by the only one in here was that's long into this open?"
"1617560","1620020"," Yeah, it's full of a coin at the open for sure."
"1621680","1626700"," It's, it's, if I have to give it to anything, it's going to be a drop."
"1627100","1631240"," And then unless, unless nobody was in calls yesterday, it might not drop. "
"1631420","1634900"," There's a, there's a few factors, but I know for sure that the bears are going to be looking at"
"1634900","1635880"," this short the bell."
"1636440","1637360"," That's without a doubt."
"1637580","1638460"," That's what they're looking for. "
"1638900","1640440"," The areas are getting salty."
"1641480","1642620"," Did I understand that?"
"1644140","1645320"," Make sure it connected here."
"1645760","1646200"," Bring it started. "
"1646400","1648700"," We got four more minutes left until the opening bell."
"1650120","1651640"," We're ready to rock and roll this morning."
"1653700","1656820"," I might not be able to talk to you for the first couple of seconds because I want to see"
"1656820","1660240"," what's going on with my board. "
"1660640","1665840"," I want to see from a little panicky right now too."
"1666120","1666800"," Just be honest with you."
"1669140","1670520"," So I want to make sure I get the money. "
"1672880","1681940"," If you're just tuning in, pause this broadcast via a chance and and watch we, we're doing every day"
"1681940","1683160"," at Deli brief right before the start."
"1683460","1689760"," When we can, at least a fresh, a refresher, the most up-to-date refresher you can have, nope, for"
"1689760","1694600"," the opening bell every day before the market opens."
"1695760","1696980"," I don't need the jar, baby. "
"1697160","1697920"," I need the harrow jar."
"1699360","1700040"," Get that sauce going."
"1701420","1704460"," Congratulations to anybody that bought and held through the night. "
"1707980","1712480"," I'm going to be looking to take profit off the bell, just in case if you're wondering, so that I"
"1712480","1715060"," can re-enter once more."
"1715060","1721060"," Get a little bit of resistance above it, 45, 558, but these change typically off the bell."
"1724080","1727400"," If I get this as fast as you possibly can, we're rolling. "
"1727680","1730360"," We have three minutes left into the bell."
"1734130","1735370"," Do you long with him, baby, brother?"

"2882350","2889640"," I wanted to buy SPX options flow and a real struggle trying to find it."
"2890700","2891320"," I wanted to buy it. "
"2891800","2893560"," I went looking at Bloomberg Terminal 2."
"2894600","2896440"," I wanted to buy a Bloomberg Terminal."

"2905180","2908140"," Man, their fucking news is slow as fuck."
"2911090","2917310"," Like the instant messaging is cool, but their information is not..."
"2917310","2919170"," I don't know, I don't know."
"2919170","2920290"," I got a mixed feelings on it. "
"2921550","2926370"," Buyers stepping in down below here at 455.63. More buyers down below."
"2928650","2931130"," Take a look down below and see if there's any bags taken."
"2931350","2931990"," We're going to trade lower. "
"2934260","2936380"," And just look at this wall of buyers here."
"2937060","2937740"," It's insane."
"2940550","2941970"," Usually this is above right. "
"2960840","2967220"," So the hair indicator is a cumulative of options flow."
"2967720","2969000"," And it's real time."
"2969260","2978200"," So regardless of what, let's say, a flow service is showing you, it takes a cumulative positioning"
"2978200","2981300"," of options flow, right?"
"2981500","2984280"," It says we've got more puts coming in at the one minute hour here. "
"2984540","2988020"," We've got more puts coming in here, more puts coming in here, and more puts coming in here."
"2988700","2992320"," It also shows these green arrows, these diamonds."
"2993100","2998480"," And these diamonds are showing you the number of put contracts that are coming out versus the"
"2998480","3006800"," number of call contracts that are coming out and the impact of calls and puts on the momentum of"
"3006800","3007240"," the market. "
"3008240","3011100"," And then we have the order flow on the right-hand side here, the dome."
"3011880","3014560"," And you want to be paying attention to where the real buyers are."
"3014660","3017140"," You see how there's less buyers where we are. "
"3017420","3022260"," And there's more buyers down here, like 454.80. And that's what this ice is here."
"3023060","3023720"," Same thing above."
"3024060","3025180"," See this big red line up here. "
"3025740","3028460"," See that big mountain turns iceberg of sellers above."
"3031450","3035530"," And we'll tend to trade to one side or the other, right?"
"3035550","3039610"," So we're either going to trade to where the real buyers are down below, where the real sellers are"
"3039610","3044570"," above, based upon how much options flow there is out there, right?"
"3045130","3046730"," That's a bunch of other crap, too."
"3056460","3057000"," I don't know that. "
"3057360","3058420"," We need more words, Billy."
"3059040","3062040"," You're just good using Twitter and you need to get news."
"3063080","3063980"," I don't understand your question. "
"3065580","3066500"," So for news."
"3067160","3068080"," So that's a good point."
"3068220","3071760"," Yesterday, Joe Donut and I were talking about the news that we follow, right?"
"3072460","3076200"," And so personally, I use trade, the news for my news. "
"3077440","3080120"," If it's important, they'll tell me what that news is."
"3080720","3083960"," And if there's any impact of that news, but it's unbiased."
"3084600","3085400"," Like I don't follow CNBC. "
"3085840","3086560"," Thank you."
"3086560","3090140"," I'm understanding he'll encourage his MPC to hike rates in March."
"3095500","3096760"," So the guy that's speaking with me. "
"3096760","3097920"," That's the news that I follow."
"3099910","3104330"," And I'll read like the rags and shit when I'm outside of market hours."
"3104590","3106710"," But in market hours, I follow, trade the news. "
"3109650","3111110"," There's a lot of puts out there right now."
"3111270","3111930"," Just heads up, okay?"
"3113490","3114950"," Oh, a lot of puts where we are."
"3115990","3117630"," Now, the hair indicator, right?"
"3118250","3120650"," Might not always show where the current price is. "
"3120870","3123650"," If the hair indicator stays negative, let's say, for an hour or two."
"3124390","3125150"," And we're just trading sideways."
"3125150","3130410"," It works because it will show you that the market will eventually roll over, right?"
"3130850","3138230"," If the hair indicator is positive for two hours and we're just trading sideways, we're more than"
"3138230","3139670"," likely going to be trading up at some point. "
"3139910","3144070"," If we're trading down and the hair indicator turns flips from negative to positive."
"3144470","3149570"," You're looking for a track out there saying it's hard to see if there will be a hike of 25"
"3149570","3152110"," basis points or 50 basis points next."
"3162940","3163700"," Does that help?"
"3167320","3167640"," Yeah. "
"3167900","3170900"," You know, like, you know, to trade the news is faster than even Twitter."
"3171940","3176080"," So I get the news here faster than Walter Bloomberg posts it on Twitter."
"3176660","3178600"," If you guys listen to this news that I get. "
"3178680","3183960"," Well, it's the Plinsky saying that there's no harm for rates at three and a half percent or even"
"3183960","3185440"," four percent in Poland."
"3187060","3193340"," You'll see Walter Bloomberg probably uses a service pretty much the fastest news you can get by one"
"3193340","3194020"," to five minutes."
"3198960","3199360"," Yeah. "
"3199580","3200240"," Bloomberg terminal."
"3200440","3201860"," I'm not sold on it."
"3202560","3203460"," It's not the fastest. "
"3213950","3217030"," I think the 100 BPS might have to do with foreign markets."
"3221550","3222350"," The so."
"3225850","3228250"," Yeah, if I'm buying puts, I typically follow the big money. "
"3228950","3230650"," And then if they roll, I roll with them."
"3231490","3238670"," And I, if I'm, when I'm bullish, I put way less protection on."
"3238850","3240290"," But right now I've got a lot of protection on. "
"3243380","3246280"," It's like a cost of doing business for where we are in the market."
"3247080","3251580"," You can't, you can't ride fucking naked where we are in the market if you're a bull."
"3252260","3254740"," And I am a bull, but I am bearish right now. "
"3255760","3257820"," Actually right where we are specifically, I'm more neutral."
"3260230","3262470"," I'm my viewpoint is neutral in the market."
"3263810","3268590"," But I don't think you can trade as a bull right now without protection on yourself. "
"3270210","3276690"," IWM puts March 18, 196 P, $225,000."
"3277730","3282970"," IWM puts March 18, 196 P, $400,000."
"3286590","3288250"," Yeah, I don't think you can trade this market. "
"3288870","3289690"," I try to trade."
"3289690","3290810"," Let's start with the beginning, right?"
"3291630","3298890"," IWM puts March 18th, 196 P, $2.2 million, warning on that call, or on that put."
"3299570","3303430"," IWM March 18th, 196 P for $2.2 million. "
"3304310","3307830"," I think that might match the put wall that came out last night at the bell."
"3308410","3309430"," Let's take a look at that from yesterday."
"3310770","3312270"," I think yesterday's put wall. "
"3312830","3314910"," I think those are the same strikes, same dates."
"3315630","3319670"," Spy puts February 9th, 455 P for $76,000."
"3322170","3325070"," Now, be careful because these puts can be hedging. "
"3325770","3332870"," So the dealers will hedge these puts out into March, and you're trying to catch daily puts, right?"
"3333110","3334190"," Those two different kinds of puts too."
"3334850","3339610"," There's hedging, and there's puts with hedging, and they both have different impacts."
"3339930","3346250"," You'll see dealer hedging on hedges, and that impact will be brief, right?"
"3346930","3353210"," And then if you see follow through with puts on the market, that will then make a cascading effect"
"3353210","3354010"," that we go down. "
"3354430","3360550"," But otherwise, they won't actually print those puts that are if they're hedges unless there's a"
"3360550","3362770"," cascade of puts following with the hedging."
"3363090","3365050"," I don't know if they've described that well enough for you."
"3365970","3366830"," Just be conscious of that. "
"3367230","3372490"," About five minutes out of the top of the air, we'll get December final, also inventory data."
"3374600","3376180"," You have five more minutes and so on."
"3376180","3381560"," 2.1% also trade sales, you'll see 1.5%. I missed that. "
"3382240","3387380"," Google, February 11th, 2900c, $264,000."
"3387700","3392660"," Yeah, Google, Google, every 11th, 2900c, $2,600."
"3393680","3395700"," Couple racks for almost half mail on Google. "
"3398600","3403020"," DKNG, $63,000 in calls, February 18th, 25c."
"3423810","3426670"," XLF is looking strong still, just the heads up on that."
"3427310","3429190"," XLF hasn't sold off yet, really. "
"3429850","3431030"," That's a good indicator on the market."
"3431890","3434110"," XLU is selling down, which is good."
"3434870","3436890"," That doesn't mean that we're risk off right now. "
"3437110","3440530"," So be careful on this Hero Indicator currently."
"3441070","3448710"," Could have a lot of hedging impact on it and not seeing a put flow for today, right?"
"3448870","3450490"," A major put flow for today."
"3453910","3456730"," I might get back, and nope, I'll scratch that. "
"3456910","3457850"," I'm wrong on that."
"3458090","3466330"," I'm seeing 51,000 contracts on 455 key expiring today, February 9th."
"3467630","3471970"," Also watching a call flow coming in. "

"3519930","3527320"," So Leafly, L-F-L-Y, now a second round of calls."
"3528060","3531300"," February 18th, 7.5c for $30,000."
"3531620","3533420"," Keep your eyes on them, Leafly, for a pump. "
"3534680","3536200"," Uber, for their earnings."
"3536760","3542560"," Uber, February 11th, 39.5c, $246,000, pretty decent."
"3546390","3548150"," Pretty decent bid there on Uber. "
"3549830","3554530"," Spy puts, February 11th, 453p, $580,000."
"3555410","3559530"," As I misspoke earlier, I didn't think there was a ton of puts for today on the spy."
"3559770","3562210"," And it looks like everybody's loaded up on 455p. "
"3562930","3567830"," There's 55,000 contracts expiring today."
"3571410","3572670"," Same story on Tesla."
"3573290","3578370"," And everybody has a different story on Tesla, but we're maintaining here that the by the dip is, of"
"3578370","3579650"," course, 80, 80 to 900. "
"3580350","3582450"," And then you're trading it up to 950."
"3587090","3592590"," American Airlines, AAL, June 16th, 20c."
"3596600","3598800"," Here, indicators turning slightly green on Tesla. "
"3599100","3600180"," Maybe I'll give the benefit of the doubt."
"3601400","3602620"," We'll find some support here in Tesla."
"3603060","3604500"," Do have more sellers on Tesla. "
"3605020","3606720"," Here, indicators turning plus slightly green."
"3610680","3616080"," One minute to our date, at December final, whole telemetry is expected 2.1%, which be in line with"

"3628740","3630380"," Thanks for the update, Blood's done."

"3647120","3649120"," Some of you guys are looking for tickers to trade into. "
"3649380","3650000"," These are the immersals, celebrities."
"3651020","3651820"," They did just a few seconds."

"3656710","3661710"," American Airlines, June 16th, 20c for $582,000."
"3662270","3664430"," Nice expansion on American Airlines."
"3665330","3666730"," I think that's American Airlines, right?"
"3667190","3669070"," You're on the key being that. "

"3733590","3736450"," Watching a lot of Tesla calls come in all morning long since the bell."

"3741270","3747090"," Watching some more puts on spy, February 9th, 454p, $51,000."
"3748610","3749830"," Looks like retail traders."
"3758680","3762180"," I'd be careful not to confuse hedging with put-flow. "
"3765300","3766460"," Uber's catching a bid."
"3766900","3767960"," They have ER today."
"3768900","3773920"," Looks like they caught a bounce down below here at 38.17. Might be a nice day trade today. "

"3853840","3857820"," Another attack on the trading channel that we had from yesterday."
"3861030","3863650"," So you've faded up into the channel from yesterday. "
"3865710","3868950"," Just this localized trading channel that started yesterday."
"3869730","3870210"," Wouldn't it start?"
"3870210","3873450"," It started at 10 o'clock yesterday morning."
"3874310","3877530"," This is the second time we've traded up into that channel. "
"3878510","3879570"," I just sold for profit."
"3879770","3888330"," I bought them at $0.15, sold them for $0.20. Those were 460Cs."
"3888770","3891150"," I'm in and out of 460Cs right now if any of you guys are wondering. "
"3892330","3900610"," So February 9th, 460C, they're bouncing down at like $0.15 and then trading up to $0.20. It's good"
"3900610","3902190"," for 25.25% grips."
"3928450","3941640"," 456.44. You"
"3941640","3944340"," guys wanted me to look at that ticker that you're interested in."
"3944520","3944880"," Let me know. "
"3945760","3947540"," Let's look at Uber next."
"3951050","3954050"," Okay, so we talked about this earlier, right?"
"3954050","3958870"," I said to you that there's a difference between hedging and put flow."
"3959170","3962470"," If you don't know what that is, Google search that. "
"3962710","3964310"," I think you probably don't find it somewhere."
"3966960","3970560"," But there's a difference between hedging, flow and put flow."
"3971480","3973680"," So if I am, let me explain it. "
"3974340","3976140"," I'll give you a second here and I'll explain it to you for you."
"3980300","3981660"," So if I'm a bank, right?"
"3982840","3984940"," Make some fat old white guy with greasy fingers."
"3987580","3992420"," And I get a bunch of like young guys who are working a prop desk for me. "
"3993860","3998980"," And me and my other fat buddy, a little fat white guy, we're like, okay, so..."
"4000100","4004340"," I want Jimmy to place an order for some hedges on the market."
"4005380","4010440"," They're going to come and find me and they'll be like, okay, Jimmy, I want you to place $30 million"
"4010440","4013040"," put hedging right where we are on the market."
"4014040","4020360"," I'm going to be speech novels saying that the empirical link between money growth and inflation has"
"4020360","4022000"," weakened over recent decades. "
"4025120","4025400"," Right."
"4025660","4031620"," So I'm the prop, I'm the prop desk trader and I'm like, okay, so I slammed down $30 million on"
"4031620","4034300"," hedging for a specific date."
"4034300","4035620"," I do it in block trades. "
"4038410","4044630"," And some days my boss is going to say to me, some days my boss is going to say to"
"4044630","4053970"," me, I also want you to slap on some puts expiring today for another, another, I don't know, $100 "
"4053970","4056910",",000, $500,000 and puts for today."
"4058450","4058650"," Right."
"4058810","4059890"," So those are two different sets. "
"4061310","4066470"," The dealers, right, the market makers that all consider these people all the same right in this"
"4066470","4066770"," context."
"4067550","4069590"," They are going to look at that flow."
"4069590","4074350"," And they look at it differently and they hedge it differently. "
"4075470","4075950"," Okay."
"4077570","4078370"," What I'm here."
"4081320","4084340"," They don't, they don't look at it in the same perspective. "
"4085080","4088660"," And they don't treat it the same in how they hedge it either."
"4089600","4093040"," You don't always know how they're hedging it, but typically they treat it differently."
"4095800","4097960"," They have more buyers than sellers on Uber. "
"4099000","4105060"," First resistance on Uber, $39.94. Support lies at $38."
"4105660","4111890"," A slightly negative hero indicator."
"4112850","4115229"," Looks like you're real sellers though or above here. "
"4116510","4120950"," $39.90. Look at that wall of sellers above here."
"4129520","4130279"," This would be a big move."
"4130840","4135340"," This would be a really nice strangle or even a really nice straddle. "
"4137660","4140520"," Because if they get a good, I mean, Lyft is helping them, right?"
"4140939","4146439"," If they get a great, if they get a great, uh, ER, boom."
"4148160","4149380"," You know, it'd also be nice too."
"4149740","4153700"," You can straddle this with some, uh, with a put and call spread. "
"4154520","4158939"," That way you get the print and you don't even care about the, you don't even care about the, uh,"
"4159100","4159340"," interest."
"4161120","4166120"," So anyways, the dealer's hedged differently depending upon the, the type of puts that are being"
"4166120","4166460"," purchased."
"4167880","4170060"," You just buy some, buy some, buy a put and a call spread. "
"4172000","4174100"," You're going to tag, just do in the money on both."
"4174840","4175180"," I don't know."
"4175660","4179640"," I don't know if they would, or if we put, I would put the put spread out farther out, maybe. "
"4181120","4182479"," Call spread expiring like right now."
"4182740","4183880"," I don't know, I have to look at the math on it."
"4185560","4186760"," Let's see if they print harder. "
"4187260","4190040"," Maybe if they do them slightly outside the money because of puts and call spreads."
"4190800","4191700"," I have to look at the math on them."
"4192779","4194260"," Too complicated for me right now. "
"4196900","4198640"," It's by creating higher."
"4199900","4202180"," First resistance point was 5637."
"4203420","4212020"," You should have all seen that in the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic. "
"4212500","4222470"," If we can break through these sellers right here"
"4222470","4237080"," next target would be 457.21. Well,"
"4237160","4237680"," they can sell."
"4238240","4239840"," I mean, it depends on the time of day."
"4240100","4243340"," It depends upon the time of day. "
"4243500","4244640"," It depends on how they hedge."
"4253210","4255450"," You don't know if they're just short, long stock."
"4255750","4257090"," You don't know if they're buying stock. "
"4257330","4262550"," You don't know if they're selling or selling or buying calls."
"4262610","4263730"," You don't know what they're doing."
"4263730","4265930"," Maybe a mix of all of that as well. "
"4271950","4275490"," If you want to take that into consideration, we're looking at a negative heroin indicator over"
"4275490","4275690"," here."
"4276270","4279790"," Because I don't think that the heroin indicator accounts for some of that hedging and might."
"4280110","4281650"," I don't know the answer to that part. "
"4282930","4287070"," That sometimes makes you wonder if I should reset the heroin indicator."
"4288090","4294350"," Turn book map off and reset it to not account for the hedging."
"4295890","4305760"," Because it's really critical as the flow that's out there for today. "
"4307580","4308780"," And they're loading up."
"4309080","4311120"," So February 9th, February 9th."
"4312400","4314900"," They've now purchased Algos. "
"4314960","4320020"," They've now purchased almost 70,000 contracts on 455P."
"4320420","4321160"," Spiring today."
"4322980","4324500"," These are all bought today. "
"4325080","4326620"," They're upside down on them right now."
"4326620","4328360"," I think one point they're at like two bucks."
"4329000","4331580"," And now they're at like $13.12 or something. "
"4334320","4337300"," And we'll look at the 11th for Friday."
"4338320","4349640"," So on the 11th and Friday, we've got bulls on the long side, 460C, $1.40. Those"
"4349640","4350320"," aren't cheap either."
"4350820","4351300"," Those are expensive. "
"4353100","4358300"," Also have interest on 445P for February 11th."
"4358300","4360020"," 25,000 contracts."
"4360040","4366720"," Those cost $0.58. A cheaper buy-in if you're bearish right now rather than buying February 9th. "
"4367480","4369800"," A cheaper buy-in on 445P."
"4370520","4394220"," Those are $0.60. See you"
"4394220","4394940"," guys are saying here."
"4396740","4399320"," All the time with those greasy hand white guys. "
"4399760","4400160"," Yeah."
"4400780","4401540"," That's who they are."
"4402160","4404320"," That's who's money we're trying to take, by the way. "
"4404320","4406900"," I'm not trying to take money from another trader and investor."
"4407300","4409300"," Trying to take for a bear, anybody else."
"4410200","4412400"," I don't want all that old white guy's money. "
"4413040","4414540"," I want just a little bit."
"4415160","4416680"," Remember billions he has?"
"4416680","4420640"," He's not going to be missing a few hundred thousand or a million bucks a year."
"4421480","4428160"," You can just heal that money off without the big old white guy. "
"4430180","4431640"," I'm just sad to say it is, right?"
"4431800","4434140"," It's usually some creepy old greasy white guy."
"4447800","4449340"," You guys want to look at the..."
"4449340","4451220"," William, I'll show you guys Google real quick."
"4452480","4453300"," I'll bring up the goog. "
"4459460","4467250"," Oh, fuck his pitot up again."
"4470810","4472890"," I haven't even looked at pitot in this morning."
"4473030","4473470"," I'm sort of scared. "
"4473770","4476330"," Oh, there's a river down on spy."
"4476330","4477970"," Oh, I am."
"4480650","4481590"," Fuckin' piton. "
"4482950","4483970"," I mean, what are we going to do?"
"4484070","4485270"," We're going to trade piton to a hundred bucks."
"4486210","4487750"," You tell me piton's a hundred dollars stock."
"4489050","4489790"," So you're telling me?"
"4491090","4492950"," You got like the My Pillow guy here?"
"4496150","4497030"," Roblox, 30..."
"4497030","4498810"," Roblox, February 11th, 68C. "
"4499750","4500630"," $35,000."
"4501890","4503730"," Lots of calls, Tesla calls."
"4503730","4509730"," Tesla, February 11th, 9930C, $792,000. "
"4510790","4515490"," Spy puts, February 9th, 453 P for $59,000."
"4516770","4518670"," Lots of calls on airlines, still."
"4519030","4523690"," Lots of calls on cruise lines. "
"4525150","4529770"," And then spy calls, 454C, $220,000."
"4530570","4531830"," Net, high algo score."
"4532730","4537770"," Net, February 18th, 133C, $222,000. "
"4539150","4541010"," Can't believe piton's up right now."
"4541610","4542310"," That's just disgusting."
"4546660","4549500"," It'd be also be worn that XLU is trading higher right now. "
"4552460","4554360"," XLF is trading higher in unison."
"4556620","4561680"," Tesla is dipping deep down to 927 right now."
"4564510","4566490"," Uber is rolling over slightly as well. "
"4576930","4577870"," Tesla's falling off."
"4578050","4580530"," Let's take a look at Google and then we'll go back to Tesla and see what's up."
"4582670","4584390"," It sucks for investors. "
"4585790","4587970"," Like Tesla investors that..."
"4589090","4591130"," You know what Tesla's reminding me of?"
"4591510","4593390"," Like so many things are changing about Tesla right now."
"4596830","4598390"," Like you wouldn't see..."
"4599050","4602390"," Tesla used to be highly shorted in small ETFs."
"4602990","4604990"," Like an ETF might hold a lot of Tesla. "
"4606570","4611330"," And so short operations would go in and try to short it indirectly."
"4611850","4615910"," They wouldn't short it directly and they wouldn't short it directly through big ETFs."
"4616790","4620190"," They couldn't get a decent correlation on Tesla and the rest of the market. "
"4623470","4633070"," And Tesla is now correlated slightly better to large ETFs like the Spy, Spyder, or IWM slightly"
"4633070","4633750"," less more."
"4633750","4635650"," But much more on the S&P than it ever was."
"4636810","4640030"," What sucks about Tesla is it's starting to trade a lot like Apple. "
"4642290","4645450"," Professional traders often pick stocks to trade every day."
"4646570","4648810"," And Apple used to be a really good one to trade every day."
"4648970","4651210"," It looks like people have shifted over to Tesla. "
"4652590","4655130"," Not people like you and I or even professional single traders."
"4655350","4658270"," I'm talking about like boiler rooms and shit like that."
"4658850","4661990"," Not the ones you see in movies like professional boiler rooms. "
"4663950","4666190"," They know where to buy, they know where to sell."
"4671980","4678580"," Okay, we got resistance here at $28.57, which kind of sucks for Tesla."
"4681950","4685070"," Apple used to trade, Apple traded, but it still kind of trades like that right now. "
"4685870","4687510"," $28.50, $2900."
"4691960","4694000"," Seems like there's a pretty decent sellers up there."
"4695100","4696500"," This is where the real sellers are though. "
"4697220","4698280"," Real sellers are right here."
"4698480","4699420"," You can see on the right hand side."
"4704360","4707980"," $29.50. You guys know what my take on?"
"4710100","4711820"," It's a good feed of sellers here though. "
"4711980","4713020"," Just be careful of this right here."
"4713180","4715120"," See how pumped in this is and then boom."
"4716240","4721260"," Right at $28.50. By the dip. "
"4723140","4724300"," I'm going to be aware."
"4728180","4730520"," My the dip is down at $27.50 on Google."
"4735630","4739350"," So there's lots of good positives and negatives with Tesla right now. "
"4740070","4747020"," I'm going to have to buy this."
"4748220","4751840"," There's another good one for you for any of you guys or investors that tune in to us here."
"4752820","4753640"," You guys ready?"
"4754060","4755040"," Got another one for you. "
"4755280","4756120"," Isn't that next trade?"
"4756720","4763500"," I wish I needed to have the intern track when I'm giving you guys trades for longer trades."
"4764340","4765040"," There you go."
"4765040","4765220"," Ready?"
"4766640","4766840"," Spot. "
"4768160","4768600"," Spotify."
"4769440","4769880"," SPOT."
"4769880","4770100"," Key. "
"4771940","4775160"," June 17th, 170C, $2.8 million."
"4781380","4782160"," What does that mean?"
"4782740","4783500"," That's a golden ticket."
"4783920","4784520"," So what does that mean?"
"4786200","4789000"," It means the first thing you do is do some due diligence on that trade. "
"4792120","4792520"," Right?"
"4792720","4794000"," You want to get in that trade."
"4794280","4796240"," Second thing you do is check market conditions."
"4796680","4797120"," Where are we?"
"4798160","4801280"," Like you're seeing Spotify come out when we just made a huge rip of the market. "
"4801860","4804200"," So maybe you just hold back for a day or two."
"4805540","4807300"," Keep your eyes on that trade."
"4807980","4809820"," Make sure they're still in it, right?"
"4810000","4812220"," They're still in that 617, 170C. "
"4812620","4814620"," Make sure that it's trading in that channel."
"4816140","4817120"," That Spotify is in."
"4817920","4818920"," Buy one of those dips. "
"4820260","4824060"," And I would also say you can always do it slightly farther out."
"4824060","4826740"," You could do it like August 170C."
"4827540","4829860"," You could do it slightly more than money. "
"4829860","4831600"," Like 150 or 160C."
"4831600","4832480"," You could make it a spread."
"4834000","4835460"," And then stay in that trade. "
"4836500","4839920"," And if let's say they lose all their money in this golden ticket, this 3 million gets burned and"
"4839920","4846060"," they reposition themselves, you'll already be positioned farther out in time, more in the money."
"4846860","4847400"," Does it make sense?"
"4848160","4849380"," You won't have to reposition."
"4849780","4853440"," You're just going to be already positioned in a better position than those people are. "
"4853860","4862200"," You might not make as much of the advocate trade goes well, but you can at least position yourself"
"4862200","4862500"," well."
"4862500","4863380"," So spot."
"4864580","4866100"," June 17th. "
"4866780","4868660"," 170C, $2.8 million."
"4869380","4871220"," High algo score and a golden ticket."
"4888180","4890020"," 45468, you're looking for?"
"4899510","4901650"," Let me get that corrected now. "
"4902450","4903210"," 45474."
"4918140","4920200"," This is another good one."
"4921380","4922140"," AXP. "
"4924200","4927460"," So, AXP March 18th."
"4929000","4929520"," 180C."
"4931480","4934100"," $1.2 million calls. "
"4935100","4938080"," AXP 318 March 18th."
"4938420","4938800"," 180C."
"4939460","4941540"," $1.2 million in calls. "
"4944060","4952000"," Saw some brief weakness in financials, but now seeing more calls on financials, I'm sure."
"4952620","4955240"," The mixed bag would be wary of financials right now."
"4955240","4957680"," I think it's not signaling properly. "
"4960800","4965460"," Google, February 18th, 2900C, $362,000."
"4966900","4968980"," Be careful of financials right now."
"4971180","4972040"," Mixed bag. "
"4989200","4990440"," Yeah, that's, you know what?"
"4990660","4992080"," Native, that's a fair point too."
"4993040","4996900"," These, so some golden tickets, you have to actively manage."
"4997300","4999460"," And some of these golden tickets, I'll give you guys. "
"4999800","5004900"," This is more for the swing trader that's, you know, ready to stay in the, to a trade for one"
"5004900","5009800"," month, two weeks, six weeks, sometimes two months or three months."
"5010500","5015720"," This fish table saying Bitcoin is a speculative asset, the high volatility of its price makes it"
"5015720","5017960"," unsuitable as a store of value."
"5019900","5021120"," Where does that coin invest?"
"5021180","5022180"," He needs to hear that. "
"5027860","5028880"," I hate to reset this."
"5029020","5031740"," I'm not getting my, I'm not getting my headlines."
"5033220","5037040"," I'm getting the work of the. "
"5040660","5043260"," You have to actively manage those trades without a doubt."
"5043520","5043840"," Good point."
"5044540","5045320"," Who brought that up?"
"5046200","5047200"," Native San Francisco. "
"5047600","5055660"," You have to manage those trades without a doubt."
"5057440","5065320"," Let's test this real quick."
"5065620","5066000"," It's important. "
"5067300","5068140"," We're good to go."
"5072520","5074440"," You guys have to manage, you have to manage the trade."
"5075020","5078340"," But it is a good, even if you're just buying the stock though, sometimes the better trade to buy"
"5078340","5080880"," the stock rather than the, than the calls. "
"5081880","5084940"," But I know some of you guys are outside of the US and you're looking for longer trades."
"5085800","5087960"," You guys aren't trying to trade day in, day out."
"5088180","5092940"," I know that you're trying to pick up stocks for long calls. "
"5095640","5099900"," That aren't just a day to like three months out, one month out, six months out."
"5109400","5111000"," I'll bring Tesla back up for you guys."
"5120460","5122360"," Not everybody's doing day trading, right?"
"5138680","5140660"," You get the intern to follow these. "
"5140940","5144560"," We need to track these trades to the ones that are like one to three months out or six months"
"5144560","5144880"," out."
"5145720","5149360"," You need to get the intern to do like an ETF that tracks those trades."
"5150700","5151720"," I'll tell you what though. "
"5154400","5155860"," Those golden tickets print."
"5156620","5159380"," If you, if you time them right, you manage them correctly."
"5159920","5162460"," They have about a 90 and you're willing to wait. "
"5162980","5165340"," They have about a 90% win rate somewhere in there."
"5166120","5186340"," Look at"
"5186340","5186660"," that, huh?"
"5187300","5188180"," Those hammer candles."
"5188720","5191280"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam. "
"5192040","5193220"," Look at those hammer candles."
"5194040","5194440"," Ooh."
"5194980","5195860"," That looks bullshit. "
"5196220","5196440"," Fuck."
"5210950","5211350"," Yeah."
"5211750","5212830"," You know, Winky's making another fair. "
"5213030","5214070"," That's another thing too."
"5214210","5215110"," Let's tell him what Winky's saying."
"5215190","5216610"," You guys making some really kick ass points. "
"5218370","5221430"," So these are rules that you guys should be writing down for yourselves."
"5221830","5222770"," There's some traders in here."
"5222970","5224970"," Like, Winkyface knows what's up, knows what he's doing. "
"5226030","5227630"," These are rules that you do."
"5228370","5230110"," So I've got multiple brokerages."
"5232050","5236230"," And let's say I take a trade that I don't want to be looking at right away every day. "
"5236890","5239590"," I move it over to different brokerages than my day trading brokerages."
"5240710","5242170"," Like, some shit."
"5242850","5244930"," You don't want to be staring out all day long. "
"5245250","5249410"," Like, if you're going to buy yourself a collar, put that's a month out, three months out, do even"
"5249410","5250310"," two, three weeks out."
"5251850","5256330"," You need to need if you have a high conviction in this trade, right?"
"5256630","5257870"," If you're managing it properly."
"5259930","5265990"," If you're adding to it, if let's say you pick the wrong, let's say you bought it at the wrong"
"5265990","5266330"," dip. "
"5266490","5267470"," You want to add two over time."
"5267590","5267910"," That's fine."
"5268570","5272670"," You know, manage those trades, but you don't want to be staring at those trades all day long"
"5272670","5274030"," because they think it ugly. "
"5274470","5275390"," I have case in point."
"5276470","5278050"," I traded the apple."
"5279510","5284410"," I traded the apple stock split with like four different sets of calls. "
"5285590","5286770"," Like, you know, oh, here he goes."
"5287330","5287450"," Spy."
"5288750","5290490"," Two, fourteen, four, fifty six. "
"5291010","5291070"," See."
"5292150","5293690"," One point one million dollars."
"5296290","5297750"," We're going to talk about this right now. "
"5297790","5298090"," It's important."
"5298590","5298750"," So."
"5300510","5307170"," The apple trade for earnings, they were expiring like day of day after week later, two weeks later. "
"5308290","5313010"," All those calls and we were going up into earnings, I think about them like a month out or even"
"5313010","5315190"," longer, like month, month and a half out."
"5317250","5322430"," And I was trying to trade the premium kick, right, from all these traders."
"5324190","5329290"," When I closed them, I was like a closer and I'm holding, I think of how the ones expiring the"
"5329290","5333730"," day after the announcement of the split and then I had two week out calls and held on for the"
"5333730","5336490"," for the trade became like a free trade for me. "
"5338110","5343990"," And so they announced the, you know, the split and the stocks went through the fucking roof, like"
"5343990","5348810"," thousands of hundred percent, right, just stupid, ten thousand, fifteen thousand percent."
"5349490","5349950"," No joking."
"5350730","5351090"," Now. "
"5351810","5359590"," When I first took those calls out, they were in the money multiple times and they were red multiple"
"5359590","5360150"," times."
"5361250","5361410"," Right."
"5361410","5364290"," So like, let's say about a call for a hundred bucks. "
"5365370","5368870"," They, at one point, they were down to like thirty five dollars and another point there at two"

"5369470","5373310"," But I was trading those calls with two ideas in mind."
"5373310","5377010"," One, I wanted the premium for the run up into earnings, right?"
"5377290","5378530"," So it took some profit on that. "
"5379210","5381890"," And then I had others on what the announcement would be."
"5382910","5383110"," Right."
"5383250","5388110"," So I held, even though they had fluctuated all that time and I didn't stare at them every day"
"5388110","5389270"," because it would make me panic. "
"5390370","5397130"," So if you like trading to an event or trading to, like, I'm looking for a certain price, it's"
"5397130","5400310"," better to not stare at them all day long, especially if they're high conviction trade."
"5404920","5405840"," Good morning, PBO."

"5835350","5839310"," guess my thought is, my thought on these put spreads is right. "
"5839310","5841570"," Take a look back on."
"5843510","5847430"," Look back on previous OPEX."
"5848750","5852010"," And start thinking from a bank's perspective. "
"5853470","5859750"," We tend to trade low and high, heading into OPEXes and Quad Witchings."
"5860590","5862890"," You'll see a swing low and a swing high."
"5863590","5867090"," And the reason for that is because the banks never lose. "
"5867090","5871690"," The banks want to win on their long side and their short side."
"5872210","5875910"," Banks tend to trade with a spread, right?"
"5876130","5878390"," They'll trade a hedge and they'll trade along."
"5879330","5882850"," So let's say a bank buys, I don't know. "
"5883650","5884490"," They have bank buys."
"5887030","5888770"," Let's make it simple."
"5889270","5890490"," Let's say we're at 400. "
"5891510","5896210"," And they buy 380 P, expiring in three months."
"5896890","5897350"," Right?"
"5900780","5906600"," And let's say the market trades down towards that 380 P, right?"
"5906940","5908280"," Well, they'll sell calls above."
"5910420","5912680"," Their 380 P comes into the money. "
"5914080","5914540"," Right?"
"5915060","5915920"," So they cash out."
"5916040","5917700"," They sell all those puts that they had, right?"
"5918400","5920860"," All these bears that again, super old, who, who, who bearish."
"5921980","5922240"," Right?"
"5922720","5924380"," And they've sold all those calls above. "
"5924680","5925440"," They made all that money."
"5925620","5927140"," And they take all those calls back."
"5927140","5928780"," They sold all those calls. "
"5929100","5931620"," They sell all those puts later on, right?"
"5931820","5932660"," They've cleaned up."
"5932800","5933880"," Now they'll long the market."
"5935100","5937340"," And they'll ride it up to 420. "
"5938840","5939960"," Make all that money back."
"5941160","5943760"," I think this is the second time they want all that money, right?"
"5944380","5947440"," And then it'll trade down back to 400 once we come into OPEC."
"5947740","5949260"," So you'll see like a swing high, swing low. "
"5950180","5951460"," And then it goes for right where they want it to be."
"5951780","5952420"," And that might not be 400."
"5952860","5954480"," It's not a good example at the next OPEC. "
"5954940","5955480"," It could be like 420."
"5956660","5959560"," The swing low at, let's say, swing high, 440."
"5959760","5960600"," And then a swing low of 380. "
"5961760","5965780"," But they'll swing it up and swing it down on their, on the general direction of where the market's"
"5965780","5965920"," heading."
"5967540","5969360"," And you'll always notice that I know pexas."
"5970100","5974240"," You'll, you notice it on daily weekly and midweek opexas, right?"
"5974380","5981240"," If you're in an opex, eventually that, that time of day, they're going to try to park, uh, park"
"5981240","5982800"," where they want the market to be. "
"5983560","5984840"," You can notice it today."
"5986620","5988700"," You can notice I say you want to see the fraud in the market."
"5989320","5993260"," We are trading higher today for once, uh, making for multiple reasons. "
"5994300","5999140"," We've got some mechanical reasons over trading here, but also because we have CPI tomorrow too,"
"5999140","5999400"," right?"
"6000260","6001960"," Let's get a bad CPI print."
"6002460","6004960"," We're still having sold down deep into the market."
"6005820","6007960"," So there is some manipulation in the market. "
"6010100","6011360"," So the banks never lose."
"6013900","6017060"," So do I think we're at 460 or 480 on opex in February?"
"6017900","6018540"," And maybe."
"6020950","6022310"," Let's see a three month chart and see. "
"6024250","6025610"," It looks kind of wild, right?"
"6026190","6026870"," Look at a three month chart."
"6027010","6027730"," We trade all at 480."
"6029430","6030770"," We trade all the way down to 420. "
"6032950","6033310"," Right?"
"6033730","6034870"," What do you think they wanted for opex?"
"6036810","6037670"," I think it's 440."
"6037670","6039810"," For 60."
"6041550","6043230"," For 50 somewhere in there. "
"6043830","6044830"," Like 440 to 450."
"6045150","6045810"," I think of my mind."
"6056600","6057040"," Yeah. "
"6057580","6058000"," Well, it is."
"6058220","6058960"," There's an opex day."
"6059360","6060600"," We have opexes every day of the week. "
"6061420","6062600"," And it happens on a minor."
"6063040","6064060"," Happens on a minor."
"6065140","6072800"," Uh, happens minorly on a, um, like on a small time frame on a daily weekly. "
"6073680","6074380"," In a monthly."
"6074960","6076660"," And it's huge on a quarterly."
"6079050","6080410"," Not always, you know. "
"6080870","6082890"," It's not like we're not talking about absolutes here."
"6083530","6084450"," We're not siths."
"6086330","6090930"," But you, uh, you'll tend to see they'll move the market with print their shit. "
"6091090","6092050"," They don't care about you and I."
"6093010","6094350"," They care about their money."
"6100300","6102720"," Yeah, you know, I can't talk much about CVS, right?"
"6102940","6105800"," What did I, I made a comment about CVS last week, right?"
"6106120","6106940"," What did I say about CVS?"
"6110180","6111420"," What did I say about CVS?"
"6113080","6114680"," Does anybody remember what I said about CVS?"
"6119320","6120560"," Anybody out there remember what I said?"
"6123530","6130550"," I said, I can't talk too much about CVS because I have family in CVS."
"6131430","6132470"," And I wouldn't belong it. "
"6135070","6136330"," As far as I could go with it."
"6150630","6152450"," I don't want to get in trouble for that to fit."
"6154010","6155370"," I don't even trade it for that reason. "
"6157170","6163990"," Spy February 9th, 456 P, 160, $160,000."
"6165090","6169610"," Costco, February 11th, 535 C, $39,000."

"6196910","6203120"," 9, my dad comes from 13. "
"6204240","6206840"," And then my wife's family is huge as well."
"6207920","6212860"," And we live all over the country and are actually outside of the country too."
"6214440","6217240"," A lot of the military and government people in our family. "
"6217480","6218780"," So we spread out everywhere."
"6224210","6227350"," It's that old school Irish Catholic German blood."

"6231630","6233670"," It's a huge big family."
"6235310","6236390"," Big family."
"6242800","6245280"," I can't comment on certain tickers. "
"6245380","6247060"," I have to be careful what I comment on."
"6247500","6252540"," Be careful on some EV tickers and have to be careful on CVS to a few of them."
"6254520","6255880"," They can't comment on. "
"6258180","6259960"," There's some things that can't comment on them."
"6267760","6269720"," I'll make like general statements, but that's it."
"6281220","6283720"," The spies kind of was sitting on a thing over here, right?"

"6314540","6323500"," We came up here, projection, a bounce, second bounce, created up slightly higher, 456, 67."
"6323800","6324560"," This is good for the bulls."
"6326020","6327540"," And look for a third bounce here. "
"6327540","6334140"," Now, if we can get catch a third bounce right here on spy, I'm going to be interested in taking"
"6334140","6334580"," a long."

"6936800","6941760"," If you're going to trade the queues today, trade them up into the close, but not after the close. "
"6942040","6942960"," There could be some volatility."
"6964110","6969850"," You can have a bearish stance and still trade long."
"6970850","6974750"," You're a fool if you can't do that. "
"6978930","6983510"," You'll either blow up your account or you don't have an account, one or the other."

"8093660","8096060"," They pumped it and they obviously jumped after."
"8096240","8099540"," Staying stupidly short covering for CPI. "
"8100620","8102640"," Yeah, they have to short cover because they're there."
"8102640","8105540"," Where do they take the shorts?"
"8108340","8115920"," They're going to let it go higher and higher when they get better positioning on short, right?"
"8120180","8122700"," You don't want to take short for CPI at 450."
"8123100","8123880"," You want to take it at 460. "
"8129250","8130770"," So more Nvidia calls."
"8132370","8138150"," BBIG has been pumped this morning, so BBIG, February 18th, 3.5C, 21,000 dollars."
"8138150","8139110"," Nvidia more calls. "
"8139650","8141850"," June 17th now further out."
"8142850","8145890"," 280C for $900,000."
"8146030","8152190"," Spy puts February 9th, 454P for $55,000. "
"8152770","8159190"," Spy calls February 9th for 456C for $128,000."
"8206860","8214600"," Yeah, if you want a short CPI, the best short is going long on the VIX, of course."
"8215680","8218920"," Because then you don't even have to worry about what the CPI numbers are. "
"8220080","8221940"," You want to short the spy on CPI."
"8222480","8224120"," You want to trade up to 460."
"8224440","8225840"," You want to get as high as you possibly can. "
"8246230","8247530"," Bears leaning in here."
"8247650","8257330"," They want to see the market roll over watching some spy puts February 14th for $50 key for $100 "
"8257330","8258170",",000."
"8258170","8263830"," QQQ puts February 9th, $62,000. "
"8264410","8269770"," IWM puts February 18th, 198P for $251,000."
"8271170","8275370"," Take a look at the majors and see if they're about to roll over or not."
"8279959","8281520"," The XLU is dipping. "
"8285040","8287000"," The XLV is slightly rolling over."
"8288120","8289299"," Apple looks strong right now."
"8290340","8294840"," Look to see if there's a reverse left on the big guys. "
"8298070","8299150"," Let's see the VIX."
"8309410","8314530"," More AMD calls February 11th, 135C for $100,000."
"8314889","8321370"," Disney calls February 18th, 160C for $80,000. "
"8321930","8322809"," Yeah, I'm not sure in Disney."
"8323209","8326330"," I feel like Disney, though, is not a bad place to buy Disney right now."
"8329299","8331760"," I like the Disney trade over the long term. "
"8331940","8334799"," If you wanted to buy a stock right now, they traded down to $129."
"8337480","8338660"," Let's look back at Disney."
"8339879","8344660"," They dipped $129 in the first time they were there. "
"8345719","8351400"," They first traded that level back on April of 2019."
"8352959","8357580"," They did trade lower down to $80 at one point, and they traded way higher to $200."
"8360180","8365959"," If you want to invest in the market, Disney is not a bad price at that $130 mark. "
"8368660","8370799"," I don't think you can hold Disney for a day."
"8371020","8375180"," I think you have to hold Disney for much longer time frame."
"8378540","8381780"," It's definitely traded back farther than, let's say, an apple. "
"8383260","8384940"," It wouldn't buy apple here."
"8386459","8389100"," Although, there are calls to $190 right now in Apple."
"8389620","8392380"," I just don't like where Apple is versus where Disney is. "
"8393420","8397280"," You guys want to know that we're talking about this."
"8398120","8399120"," Keep talking about this."
"8399340","8401680"," I feel like banks, they still have to make their money right. "
"8402120","8407060"," They make credit to make their money from bonds, to buy bond exposure, and then equity's exposure,"
"8408120","8413130"," because inflation is so high, right?"
"8414310","8417610"," They'll always trade the market, even if the market crashes, quote unquote."
"8419130","8424570"," There's going to be certain times in the next January, February, March, and then again in June,"
"8425330","8430630"," possibly even later, let's call it maybe November or something, or October, even September, where"
"8430630","8431990"," we could go get dips in the market."
"8432890","8438010"," If we trade sideways and sell it up for the year, where one ticker might be low and one ticker"
"8438010","8445490"," might not be, there's going to be identifying those stocks that you can buy. "
"8446010","8446890"," More calls on net."
"8447630","8448890"," I talked about them earlier too."
"8449510","8454470"," N.E.T., February 18th, 133C, $210,000 for the high algo score. "
"8458820","8463840"," As much as I hate Facebook, I mean, would I rather buy Facebook or Apple here?"
"8464380","8464800"," Probably Facebook."
"8470320","8472060"," More AMD calls, more Twitter calls."
"8499950","8501530"," Yeah, I saw that meta news earlier. "
"8512190","8514930"," I like Nike more for just a buy and hold."
"8517600","8519260"," I don't know that I like calls on Nike."
"8524560","8527580"," I think they're a nice defense of, hey, I want money in my money in the market. "
"8531720","8534480"," I mean, look at Nike over the course of a year."
"8537660","8539620"," The low here is at $140."
"8541980","8546980"," I mean, between, I mean, they could get knocked down. "
"8546980","8556980"," If you're going to look back to March 2020, right, they were at February 2020, they were at like"
"8556980","8557780"," 90 bucks."
"8558960","8565580"," But one of the innovative things that Nike has done, the reason why I believe Nike is still up, is"
"8565580","8571980"," because of their, they have this whole, they've changed their selling direct to consumer now or"
"8571980","8572680"," something like that."
"8573740","8577080"," They're trying to innovate how they sell their products. "
"8577080","8581360"," I think that was a couple of years ago, they talked about it."
"8589420","8592100"," Qcom calls, everybody likes Qcom."
"8593320","8598700"," Nvidia calls, Nvidia calls, February 18th, 265C, half a million dollars. "
"8599340","8608400"," Qcom, February 11th, $39,000 on 187.5. 187 is the rep that they gave"
"8608400","8609640"," me."
"8609640","8617340"," They made 7.5C, $39,000 spy calls, February 16th, 457C for $400,000."
"8618280","8622900"," AMD more calls, let's just keep piling in February 11th, 135C. "
"8623500","8628960"," More spy calls, February 11th, 456C, $161,000."
"8629840","8631360"," Looks like day traders are in charge."
"8647940","8657930"," I mean, just look at this, look at this spy, just observing sellers, more"
"8657930","8664690"," sellers than buyers, but just keeps trading now, printing up all day long. "
"8666130","8667930"," More, same spy spy calls."
"8669390","8675150"," I want to separate, we're a bullish indicator of 90."
"8675770","8682550"," What the call ratio is 0.37. We have 204,000 calls, the 7,000 puts. "
"8684930","8687650"," More AMD calls, February 11th, 135C."
"8691200","8692940"," Just keep grinding higher and higher."
"8693980","8695260"," This is called the melt-up. "
"8695800","8698700"," Not really, there's other melt-ups."
"8700060","8702940"," But this to me looks just like just grinding higher."
"8703760","8705280"," The value of puts are coming off. "
"8708240","8711120"," Today as an OPEX, we should see more puts burn off today."
"8715880","8716400"," Tesla."
"8717420","8725550"," Yeah, you guys know about that. "
"8725830","8727030"," Do you guys remember that on Nike?"
"8727350","8730750"," They were talking about their innovation and how they're directly direct to customer."
"8751410","8755530"," I don't know if it's a long-term investment, but let's say you bought Nike today, you're probably"
"8755530","8757030"," able to take some profit off it."
"8757370","8758190"," That's better than inflation. "
"8763470","8768670"," As option flow for stocks, closing to earnings is a good indicator of direction when these options"
"8768670","8769610"," be just bets."
"8771310","8773850"," Yeah, there's a portion of..."
"8774710","8775730"," Hold on a second here."
"8775890","8778390"," These headphones suck. "
"8780010","8781870"," So, let's talk about..."
"8784320","8786340"," You've got people that know that there's going to be interest."
"8786800","8787660"," Let's say Uber, right?"
"8787980","8791580"," You know there's going to be interest in Uber up to their ER."
"8792760","8801940"," So people will trade it up to, let's say, 3 o'clock, 3.30. That doesn't mean you're holding those"
"8801940","8802580"," into the close. "
"8803080","8807580"," You're also seeing people that are buying a gambling, of course, right?"
"8812560","8816400"," They do drop some limited edition shoes and they sell faster than they can even log in."
"8817860","8819480"," Yeah, Nike pulled their products from Amazon."
"8819920","8823420"," Nike's got this whole thing where they weren't looking..."
"8823420","8826900"," Everyone thought the trade was over in Nike and then Nike had one of their earnings. "
"8827180","8828000"," I forget which one it was."
"8831140","8832320"," Was it a few years ago?"
"8832580","8837920"," Yeah, I remember they had this whole thing where they were trying to stay profitable."
"8839700","8841320"," What you want to hear..."
"8841320","8843080"," You want to hear that from companies, right?"
"8843220","8844600"," You don't want to hear what Pete Todd is saying. "
"8844860","8845920"," You want to hear..."
"8851070","8852650"," I think you have to look at their ER."
"8853250","8855030"," Like the research that ER..."
"8855030","8856750"," And I know that that's why they didn't..."
"8856750","8860450"," The expectation was that Nike would sell off."
"8863800","8865020"," Thanks for the heads up, Bloodstunned. "
"8865760","8867700"," Bloodstunned saying the heat map is almost screened by all sectors."
"8868840","8870180"," Marriage and household goods only laggards."
"8874040","8877340"," What you do, right, is get yourself a basket of stocks, right?"
"8877340","8879900"," Just find yourself 20, 30, 50 stocks. "
"8880540","8886320"," See what has traded back to close to March and May of 2020, right?"
"8889030","8890210"," We'll give them most of it back."
"8890530","8893950"," Then you're looking to see what their last guidance and their upcoming guidance is."
"8894470","8900090"," You're going to hear them say to you, hey, we're expecting growth or not, or hey, we did the work"
"8900090","8905370"," we were supposed to do with the free money that we had and we expect continued growth over time. "
"8905370","8912110"," And when you're hearing that in your favorite companies, ER, they're telling you that they're safe,"
"8912430","8912530"," right?"
"8912730","8913290"," They're going to make it."
"8914650","8919590"," You know, that's why you get companies like PTON trying to get ahead of their ERs and saying, you"
"8919590","8922750"," know, we cut this, we cut that, we didn't do this, we didn't do that."
"8922950","8930170"," And even though PTON is trading up right now, their long-term viability is we better sell to"
"8930170","8930470"," somebody. "
"8931990","8933910"," Not for a $40 ticker."
"8933910","8938830"," You don't want to be buying that ticker where we are in the market right now."
"8944070","8952600"," And even then you need to be managing your trades to a predetermined place, right?"
"8953560","8958240"," You're looking for, I'm going to buy this at $100. "
"8958460","8961540"," I'm willing to average down to $80 and then I'm going to take it to $120."
"8965260","8969760"," The days of, the days of trading the market where you're like, I can buy any dip and we're just"
"8969760","8972060"," going to crank it to the moon no matter what."
"8972520","8973320"," Just buy and hold. "
"8973840","8974620"," Those days are over."
"8975680","8981760"," The days of the stock pumpers out there saying, you know, you just buy any, you know, anybody with"
"8981760","8984180"," a fucking website and it's going to go up."
"8984660","8985260"," Those days are over. "
"8985600","8986120"," Right now they are."
"8987040","8988880"," No matter anybody tells you they're over for right now."
"8990760","8996440"," Until free money come, until free, we have free money right now, but we don't have free money that"
"8996440","9000380"," the promise of free money for a couple of years of growth. "
"9001540","9011500"," Did you guys ever see that, did you guys ever see GRX has broke"
"9011500","9011880"," 30?"
"9013460","9016040"," Did you guys ever see the video that I put up?"
"9016700","9020800"," Now I'm not a fan completely of Ray Dalio."
"9021660","9024140"," I'm going to post it right now again at Captain's Alpha."
"9024140","9029740"," It's worth the watch because it gives a fair, if you want a dumb down version of how the economy"
"9029740","9037160"," and the markets work, he does a really good video from like 10 years ago or 15 years ago where"
"9037160","9042460"," he explains in basic terms, if you don't understand the bond market, if you don't understand the"
"9042460","9050340"," Fed, if you don't understand the interplay of how our markets operate, over time, like short and"
"9050340","9055480"," long term debt cycles, the Ray Dalio video on YouTube is, let me look it up real quick. "
"9057850","9063290"," You don't even really need to know more than that either than that video."
"9063470","9064910"," There's not much more that you need to know."
"9065410","9072200"," Let me look up what the video is called. "
"9079470","9081490"," Didn't get much right here."
"9081490","9083430"," They posted like eight years ago."
"9084250","9086350"," So I'm going to get this video for you. "
"9086490","9094470"," I'm going to post it to, I know that sometimes people can make, people can over complicate things"
"9094470","9097850"," intentionally, especially like Twitter."
"9098790","9101390"," People are constantly over-complicating things."
"9102130","9105050"," I'm going to post this right now at Captain's Alpha for you. "
"9106050","9107110"," And it's a great video."
"9108330","9111150"," It doesn't matter if it applies to now or not."
"9111150","9117750"," It's a good video for anyone to, it's called economics 101, how the economic machine works. "
"9118670","9119950"," And it's a really good video."
"9120290","9130110"," It's like, if you want a macro view of the markets and the economy,"
"9130950","9138490"," it does a fair job of giving you just basic idea of your macro environment."
"9139530","9140810"," I just posted it now. "
"9141570","9142770"," It's a slow day right now."
"9145530","9155460"," So, I think that, I think that a lot of you need to watch that video because I sometimes"
"9155460","9160160"," I get questions from people, not everybody, but I think sometimes I get questions people that I'll"
"9160160","9163060"," say or things people say to me and I wonder."
"9163440","9166620"," I'm like, do they understand the macro side of our markets?"
"9168040","9172540"," Even when we have, because this answers even the questions for when we have free money, right?"
"9172920","9174700"," What should happen when we have free money?"
"9174900","9176600"," What should happen when we have tightening?"
"9177660","9178040"," It's not. "
"9178660","9179620"," It always happens."
"9180200","9180720"," It's the point."
"9181100","9190020"," There's never a time that the market doesn't act a certain way, depending upon our environment or"
"9190020","9191200"," our macro environment. "
"9191680","9192400"," I don't know if that makes sense."
"9194000","9202340"," So, when we had free money in March of 2020, you are going to have an expectation of how the"
"9202340","9210140"," market acts and the market did act like it did for 2020 and 2021 in that environment."
"9210140","9215420"," Right now, we still have free money in the market, although there's a promise right now that"
"9215420","9220680"," they're going to stop the free money flow and they're going to pull the plug on the money that's in"
"9220680","9221440"," the system as well. "
"9221980","9229020"," So, you want to have that basic concept and idea for your macro view on where the markets are"
"9229020","9230800"," headed right now."
"9232280","9232700"," Okay?"
"9233160","9234400"," Because they hold true every time."
"9234520","9240800"," There's never been a time in history, including, in up to December 31st, 2021, that the markets"
"9240800","9246520"," haven't acted in response to what Ray talks about in that video. "
"9248220","9253220"," Spy calls, February 16th, 457C, $191,000."
"9255000","9256660"," More calls on BBIG."
"9258540","9259600"," More BBIG pumps. "
"9264320","9265760"," Oh, so you did wash it, Josh."
"9266060","9266580"," It's really cool."
"9267280","9269320"," I mean, dude, I get so lost sometimes. "
"9269760","9270540"," I will listen."
"9271740","9272520"," Pick a lane, Spy."
"9274500","9277540"," Yeah, credit is king. "
"9278320","9284280"," The thing on, yeah, pen flow is bullish right now."
"9284520","9285400"," I'll bring up pen."
"9285480","9287680"," If you guys want to call it some tickers, I'll do some tickers for you. "
"9290040","9296200"," So, if you're going to, like, sometimes I'll go down the rabbit hole and I'll listen to some real"
"9296200","9301140"," freaks and weirdos talk about bonds or I'll hear someone talking about tightening."
"9301880","9304260"," I'll hear someone talking about all kinds of nonsense, right?"
"9304400","9307720"," And I get lost sometimes where I just get lost."
"9308060","9310020"," I'm like, what the fuck are they trying to say to me?"
"9310360","9311380"," Are they saying the market's going up?"
"9311520","9312620"," Are they saying the market's going down?"
"9315750","9320250"," And when you get lost like that, you just come back to a basic understanding of economics and how"
"9320250","9320670"," it works. "
"9323000","9328560"," There are some other things you need to know, like geopolitics, stuff like that, in terms of"
"9328560","9330460"," macroeconomics and the world of worldview."
"9331280","9336420"," But for a general idea of how markets work, that video is pretty good."
"9343960","9345820"," No, I haven't watched anything from me, Kevin. "
"9346100","9346940"," What did me, Kevin, say?"
"9348460","9350040"," They really say it was ending his channel."
"9356080","9357860"," Yeah, four years ago and then I see that."
"9359600","9360360"," I've seen that. "
"9365020","9366400"," I haven't seen anything about me, Kevin."
"9367460","9368940"," I mean, I'd be upset if I was him."
"9369060","9370960"," A lot of his fucking, it was really weird. "
"9371080","9373640"," There's like a lot of people that copied him for the past couple of years."
"9375380","9377200"," And then they all became buddies and friends."
"9378420","9382080"," And then it seemed like they threw him under a bus because they felt like they were thrown under a"
"9382080","9382340"," bus. "
"9383500","9390480"," Then I saw some other weirdos talking about, some other weirdos was saying, you can't trust me,"
"9390620","9392940"," Kevin, because his convictions."
"9395400","9397100"," That he's like, he sells these classes."
"9398720","9403000"," You can't trust them because if he doesn't have any conviction in his trading and his investing,"
"9403240","9405140"," then how do you trust his classes?"
"9406100","9410700"," But me, Kevin's classes were appropriate for the last two years. "
"9411000","9417820"," I just don't think that they're appropriate now, but, you know, and the worst part is that banks"
"9417820","9419280"," don't, banks trade for the day."
"9420740","9424780"," Like banks can move and adjust and shift whenever they feel like it."
"9424940","9432260"," I always hear like our investors are like, you have to have this conviction and you can't, you"
"9432260","9433900"," can't get rid of that conviction. "
"9435140","9436700"," Then you do trade with a conviction."
"9438260","9445260"," But if something changes and you need to change, you need to shift with it, then I don't see the"
"9445260","9445860"," problem that."
"9446480","9448900"," I don't see the problem with me, Kevin, doing that either. "
"9449320","9454680"," If me Kevin switches to some kind of a new trading format or style, all the power to him."
"9456880","9460080"," That gives him more credit for doing that where others haven't."
"9463200","9470220"," Watching more spy calls, February 9th, 454C, a couple hundred thousand dollars. "
"9470520","9474260"," Google calls, Yowza, talked about Google, right?"
"9474820","9476560"," Talked yesterday about Google being a good trade."
"9478220","9479760"," Good investment trade, right?"
"9480060","9484920"," Google, May 20th, 2800C, 9.3 million dollars."
"9485540","9490240"," Talked about the other day about Google, the Google trade into June and July, right?"
"9490700","9493820"," You buy Google now, you let the premium just grow in that shit. "
"9494220","9497880"," Buy a nice round number and you just watch what happens as we move into June."
"9498240","9501620"," You guys want to buy a stock for a flip?"
"9501840","9506820"," Not at the stock, but you want to buy like some calls, buy some calls on Google expiring in like"
"9506820","9509900"," August, July."
"9511120","9512120"," Nice round number. "
"9512480","9517120"," You just hold them and then as that split comes in, you're going to see the premium just, you could"
"9517120","9521640"," be upside down in those calls and the premium alone comes June is going to pay you."
"9523720","9528940"," Calls on QQQs, February 9th, 366C, $51,000."
"9529700","9533580"," Shop, February 11th, 1,000 calls for $50,000. "
"9534860","9537860"," More BBIG pumping, more AMC pumping."
"9543210","9544150"," I'll see you guys are saying."
"9557190","9559170"," Some of them are being taken down by the SEC. "
"9560190","9561470"," Yeah, you know, that's my other problem."
"9561470","9563750"," Like, I used to have a problem with those pumpers, right?"
"9564570","9567030"," But I have more of a fucking problem with the Senate."
"9572820","9577380"," And me Kevin's saying that he, how he thinks the market is going to crash basically by Q1 2023. "
"9578000","9584100"," Yeah, I understand that view point, but why not just buy some fucking hedges and keep trading"
"9584100","9584920"," what's in front of you?"
"9585480","9587160"," I understand that aspect of me Kevin."
"9587720","9588800"," It's just buy some hedging."
"9590720","9595080"," There's all kinds of different strategies to edge the market for a crash. "
"9597200","9598640"," All the banks had just for a crash."
"9600300","9601600"," Hey, get Gavin, take it easy."
"9602360","9603200"," How would he end his channel?"
"9603480","9603680"," How would he end his channel?"
"9603700","9605460"," How would he make 7K a day from the YouTube channel?"
"9605640","9608220"," He probably makes more than 7K a day from his YouTube channel. "
"9611400","9614060"," I spent almost zero time trading each day."
"9615460","9618760"," In the fourth, he's better range, all been accompanied, accomplished after hours."
"9619400","9620140"," We'll be interested in the CEO. "
"9620440","9622400"," We find it where it goes into the intraday."
"9623520","9625920"," Some of them being, yeah, like my problem is really with the Senate."
"9625920","9631620"," Like, I've got a bigger fucking problem with the fact that companies and individuals can inside a"
"9631620","9632400"," trade this market. "
"9633060","9635100"," People inside this trade, people are inside a trade."
"9635380","9636640"," Like, dude, Peton's a prime example."
"9636840","9637640"," It's being traded by inside. "
"9638840","9641260"," But they're basically inside a trading right now, Peton."
"9642200","9647920"," The people that own Peton's stock and people that are principles within the company, they should be"
"9647920","9653020"," going after those people before they go after a stock bumper like, a sack of Morris."
"9654020","9659420"," I mean, I fucking don't like those guys or I don't trade with those guys or like what they do,"
"9659720","9665380"," but there's people that with, you know, nice clean suits that do it a lot worse than those guys do. "
"9674410","9677510"," Oh, dude, you guys, we guys want to have a fur who's getting exposed."
"9678010","9680950"," You guys have a, like, all right."
"9681990","9686650"," So, don't you guys saw the whole more spy calls?"
"9687570","9690750"," February 9th, 454C, $300,000. "
"9691070","9694250"," So, you guys got a, like, you got, like, I don't like furrows either, okay?"
"9694410","9695290"," I'm not a fan of furrows."
"9695410","9698290"," I'm not a fan of selling all that shit, song classes and all that shit, right?"
"9698670","9703870"," But you got to, you as a trader and investor have to identify what people are doing, right?"
"9704850","9713450"," But at the same time, like, let's look at, like, a Hindenburg research, right?"
"9713630","9714150"," Big short operation."
"9715330","9720130"," They had a bunch of leaks and they're doing the same shit, just shorting stocks, right?"
"9720430","9727490"," They've got bullshit, scam, scam research, and then they hook up with other people and they do the"
"9727490","9727930"," same thing. "
"9728110","9731330"," They do the same fucking thing that pumpers are doing, even worse in some respects."
"9735320","9739420"," You see, you got, like, white-suited people inside of trading across the board."
"9744850","9745610"," Yeah, you can't trade stocks. "
"9748330","9749850"," Yeah, dude, what about Darkpool?"
"9750650","9752470"," Seriously, there's so much other shit out there."
"9752870","9754810"," The SEC never goes after those people."
"9755530","9760010"," Like, the fuckery that JP Morgan does, the GS does, is unreal. "
"9779140","9780180"," Like, I know they're scumbags."
"9780780","9783000"," I know what they're doing, right?"
"9783140","9783860"," We saw that other guy."
"9785120","9788080"," We saw that other guy for, um, who was his name?"
"9788720","9797160"," Zach Morris came out and apologized and said that he's, uh, that he's what?"
"9797700","9799880"," Well, you guys, I'm going to hold on a second here. "
"9799940","9800560"," Darkpool is fine."
"9800740","9801820"," Just probably darkpool reporting."
"9802620","9803780"," You see, you updated it. "
"9803960","9807620"," He's looking ready to roll over after I tried and failed to fade it multiple times already."
"9808380","9810400"," Cap's about to get exposed for paper trading."
"9810660","9811040"," Hilarious. "
"9813260","9815880"," Well, maybe Jeff Bridget, Jeff Bridget back or whatever."
"9815880","9816400"," He's cool."
"9817140","9818860"," I don't, I think I know JD Bridget back. "
"9820860","9822700"," I think I know who he is."
"9823140","9826300"," Spike up and head on the one hour from February 2nd."
"9826620","9829440"," Maybe I retraced the 450 is in the cards before 460. "
"9830980","9833980"," How can you sue people who take your trades and repost them?"
"9834100","9835100"," I've seen that a lot."
"9836020","9839320"," I don't know anything about suing people for taking your trades and reposting them."
"9841300","9842200"," What's all that about?"
"9842540","9843180"," I don't know what that means. "
"9844440","9846100"," Remember what Hindenburg did to Dash?"
"9846420","9848840"," Yeah, I read all the, uh, I read all the fucking leaks on him."
"9849960","9853960"," I don't like the fact that they'll like, I don't like the fact that these pumpers will like hold"
"9853960","9854140"," it."
"9854240","9858180"," We were, or Joe and I were talking about how they will get a low float stock and they buy"
"9858180","9860300"," a bunch of it and they sell into their followers. "
"9864920","9867340"," Treating out their positions ahead of time."
"9867580","9867640"," Nope."
"9867840","9868580"," Didn't know anything about that. "
"9873210","9875490"," Yeah, you can make unlimited money from that."
"9875690","9875750"," Yeah."
"9876090","9876910"," 67 cents stock. "
"9876910","9878910"," I don't know how to find some finance buying ads."
"9879130","9879590"," Pump the stock."
"9880250","9880390"," Agree. "
"9884320","9884680"," Interesting."
"9885160","9886020"," I'm not sure it's not legit."
"9886020","9887260"," But it went back aways. "
"9887740","9888600"," Seems to track."
"9889280","9890920"," I don't know what that, I forget what that's what was that."
"9891020","9891740"," Oh, what's that about?"
"9892580","9894720"," Is it going back to his morning flush strategy now?"
"9894720","9895880"," I'm not pumping the low floats. "
"9896780","9898620"," Are you talking about, uh, Zach Morris?"
"9901060","9903240"," Yeah, so Paul keeps asking about, uh, Penn."
"9903800","9905700"," Sorry if I didn't bring that back up for you, brother."
"9906140","9906920"," I apologize, Paul. "
"9908480","9911690"," I've got more buyers than sellers."
"9912250","9913390"," Uh, ooh, I like that."
"9914630","9915450"," I do like Penn. "
"9919010","9921890"," Thanks for being persistent, Paul."
"9926300","9927480"," We'll leave this up for a minute."
"9927660","9928340"," See if the trade's higher. "
"9931380","9932640"," Well, then I gotta go back up."
"9935940","9937040"," Ways to mistake."
"9938060","9940740"," This morning flush strategy now and not pumping the low floats. "
"9945460","9947340"," I like how I lost and that's made it back."
"9947660","9949280"," That was very hard for mental health."
"9950300","9951340"," I mean, winky face. "
"9951580","9951980"," Let's do it."
"9952240","9952560"," Me too."
"9952840","9954120"," My Twitter aren't the same sadly. "
"9955400","9958920"," I used to make a lot of money now that we're the counter, but now just too well."
"9959060","9965600"," Like some of the biggest gains of the last two years was in, uh, any pumpers, not in spy, not"
"9965600","9966200"," in an IWM."
"9968880","9969320"," Okay. "
"9969500","9970660"," Watching spy calls."
"9972240","9975060"," Uh, this was for 11 45 minutes ago."

"10015620","10018280"," I see jets from eleven o'clock yesterday."
"10018960","10020240"," We saw airlines pump yesterday. "

"10035820","10036440"," From yesterday. "
"10039680","10042040"," Even though some mud puts came in."
"10043280","10045200"," J and K, H, Y, G."
"10051710","10052290"," They're looking at Apple."
"10053270","10053950"," You have Twitter for earnings. "
"10054230","10055590"," I like Twitter for earnings, believe it or not."
"10060630","10062730"," Lots of calls selling today, according to trade he takes."
"10067580","10069180"," The ISO calls right at the bell. "
"10069180","10070680"," I made a lot of money."
"10072380","10073200"," Yeah, there's both."
"10073360","10074940"," There's huge bullish flow on Google. "
"10082340","10084580"," Ten point nine million dollars on Google."
"10086560","10092760"," Have a trade for May 20th, twenty eight hundred C, nine point three million dollars."
"10093460","10097220"," Assuming the banks are going to tell you not to buy Google right now and then they're going to buy"
"10097220","10100840"," it all and they're going to sell to you as it trades up into their split. "
"10100840","10107700"," So you have five twenty twenty hundred C for nine point three million dollars."

"10123360","10123980"," February 11th. "
"10124340","10126000"," Twenty eight fifty twenty nine hundred."
"10128420","10131500"," Four, I don't know, about a million bucks."
"10132100","10133280"," It's only more than a million bucks. "
"10133580","10138280"," Total today call structure on Google ten point nine million dollars."
"10139820","10146560"," Total today on spy calls nine point two million dollars and only five point three million dollars"
"10146560","10147300"," on spy puts."
"10148360","10149840"," And video is the number three. "
"10149840","10156960"," So in terms of bullish and bearishness where we are bullish stance on the market for the call"
"10156960","10157340"," ratio."
"10158120","10163140"," We've got Google spy and video Tesla RTX and then spot."

"10183440","10184720"," That's all the call flow was."
"10184860","10185780"," Thanks for the heads up on that."
"10188900","10190420"," Also bearish call selling. "
"10190580","10191000"," Thanks, Alex."
"10191760","10193300"," A little pricey for me today."
"10193620","10194800"," Nineteen thousand per. "
"10197520","10200220"," Yeah, Jess is a Tesla bull to no end."
"10210300","10211620"," That's a good question, Zach."
"10211940","10213360"," So Zach's asking question cap. "
"10213600","10215860"," So many of these calls to read off inspire short term."
"10216040","10217800"," What does this signal for next month or two?"
"10218480","10218960"," In your opinion."
"10219560","10224480"," So for right now, I do have Sundays or Mondays. "
"10227900","10232240"," Yeah, I'm not."
"10233940","10235060"," So on."
"10236380","10237640"," Okay, so a couple things. "
"10238540","10241240"," First one on my outlook on the market."
"10242540","10245900"," And on the spy is that."
"10246940","10248640"," Let me go on a larger scale. "
"10248800","10250660"," I've done some videos on this usually in the morning."
"10250660","10252700"," I'll talk about this stuff on Mondays."
"10255270","10257610"," Somebody thought on the market is that. "
"10258510","10260710"," We rolled over right on 480."
"10262030","10265730"," We tried it deeper than we have in the past couple of years."
"10265890","10267670"," We have one moment in June, I think of 2020. "
"10268790","10270770"," We had, of course, March, February, March."
"10271970","10272750"," And April."
"10273570","10277210"," The downturn and then the QE of 2020. "
"10277870","10279910"," But generally speaking, we've traded lower than we have."
"10280410","10282250"," We've broken some longstanding supports."
"10283030","10284110"," I'm just trading. "
"10284390","10286670"," Yes, I'm training the indexes similar to."
"10287750","10289450"," Just a straight ticker, right?"
"10289770","10290610"," A big ticker."
"10292210","10293150"," And so. "
"10294270","10295590"," It's traded down."
"10296110","10299750"," It just broke above major resistance."
"10300550","10301730"," Which is good to see. "
"10303940","10304580"," Right."
"10304620","10305780"," So we're going to look for."
"10306380","10308880"," We just broke through major resistance, right?"
"10309160","10310540"," We've been breaking down over time. "
"10311240","10314160"," So now I'm going to look for consolidation on the spy and then move higher."
"10315680","10315740"," Right."
"10317280","10318520"," I'm not going to get. "
"10318740","10321060"," So this is a neutral phase for the spy."
"10322580","10323020"," Right."
"10323200","10324940"," So what is your outlook from here forward?"
"10325340","10326720"," Well, you want to be bullish. "
"10326740","10330720"," You want to say, OK, I want to see us trade two all-time highs."
"10330720","10332700"," Once again, let's say we're going to trade a 480."
"10334620","10339040"," But because of where we are in the spy, you have to protect those trades. "
"10339700","10341220"," So it's not free money."
"10341420","10346040"," Like when you talk about free money, this isn't a free money situation for the spy."
"10346800","10347860"," So you hedge appropriately. "
"10349660","10351520"," Heading into end of quarter."
"10353960","10358780"," And you, you manage your hedging from now into end of quarter."
"10359980","10362900"," And then you trade the day in front of you to trade to the right. "
"10362920","10366840"," So if we're trading up that day, you're trading along."
"10367920","10370440"," And maintaining and managing those shorts."
"10371680","10374180"," You actually have to do that until you get to 480. "
"10375120","10377560"," And then you're neutral again, and then you trade higher."
"10377740","10379320"," Let's say you start trading higher than 480."
"10380000","10382520"," You can lessen your hedging on the market. "
"10383840","10386080"," You can scale your hedging back dramatically."
"10387900","10393780"," This morning, in this morning's video, I briefly went over, hey, look at where we are versus, you"
"10393780","10395040"," know, previous timeframes."
"10396060","10396940"," On the spy. "
"10397360","10401920"," So whenever I see like a bull right now, that's super duper bullish."
"10402560","10408380"," You can be super duper bullish on the day, but your long-term view on the market is not my"
"10408380","10411240"," long-term view right now currently is not bullish."
"10411780","10412460"," It's bearish. "
"10414640","10421460"," It's bearish until we get to all-time highs once more and then continue above it."
"10422000","10425100"," That's when you can say I'm bullish on the market in my view."
"10425100","10427300"," It doesn't matter even that you trade up from here. "
"10427620","10430820"," In this prime examples of this, you can just look at SQ."
"10431880","10437520"," If you look at spy, compare spy right now to SQ for any other ticker, any other distribution,"
"10437820","10442200"," accumulation, distribution, and then selling regime, we're in one of those right now."
"10444530","10446930"," Time and time and again, you can see it on smaller tickers. "
"10447810","10453970"," So even with all that being said, and where we are currently in the market on ETF, you know that"
"10453970","10455890"," certain tickers are holding the market up, right?"
"10455890","10457530"," You know, Apple's holding the market up."
"10459410","10463110"," You know that the number of companies that are holding the market up are getting lesser and lesser."
"10463590","10466810"," So you're going to expect or you're going to infer that spies are going to come down further. "
"10467910","10471790"," But even in that time, you know that the banks are going to trade to the right, they're going to"
"10471790","10473070"," invest their money in tickers."
"10473430","10478790"," So they're looking for specific stocks to buy that have come back in value."
"10479890","10482110"," You know, you can see examples of those. "
"10482630","10489190"," You can look at an apple and then put it side by side to a Facebook or a Google or"
"10489190","10491530"," there's a bunch of other tickers out there."
"10491950","10496150"," We just go looking at strong, strong names."
"10497130","10498670"," And then we're in your earnings season right now. "
"10499150","10503410"," So it's important if you like a certain ticker, like let's say you like Disney, they've traded down"
"10503410","10503730"," heavily."
"10504270","10505590"," You want to pay attention to their guidance."
"10506370","10511390"," It's important as an investor for the long term to paying attention to companies that are"
"10511390","10515610"," inherently strong or inherently doing their work for their future. "
"10516170","10519870"," You're going to be looked like we looked at boards or guidance and Tesla's guidance."
"10520810","10525610"," And you're expecting certain things out of both with the thought process that we're going to"
"10525610","10527110"," tighten the three monies going away."
"10528490","10534270"," So it's like, hey, did you spend your time last two years developing for the future when things are"
"10534270","10534710"," going to be lean?"
"10534710","10537370"," Or did you fuck around and drink beer for two years?"
"10538290","10540790"," Blowing cocaine and, you know, hanging out with models. "
"10541430","10542610"," What did you do with that money?"
"10543530","10545190"," And Peton's a prime example of that."
"10546150","10547890"," Did you plan for reopening?"
"10548790","10550290"," And you find out that they didn't."
"10551030","10552730"," It doesn't matter where they're trading at right now. "
"10553090","10554290"," It's in the long term view, right?"
"10554750","10556390"," It matters over time."
"10557310","10560930"," A can they weather a down economy or a down market."
"10568840","10570160"," Anyways, this is a big long time. "
"10570440","10572780"," I've done enough videos in that shit and go back and watch them."
"10574520","10579800"," I should try how I can edit those videos, the long ones where I can pull them out and separate"
"10579800","10580160"," them."
"10583990","10585430"," Let's see what you guys are talking about here. "
"10587450","10589850"," You're going to ask me to say Tesla to make 950."
"10590030","10591870"," I think I'm back to where you're going to stop reading."
"10612040","10615900"," Is the market bearish on a stock change in Congress?"
"10617920","10618960"," I don't know. "
"10619140","10620660"," I made my thoughts known on that this morning."
"10621220","10623740"," You know, it's fucked up as we've forgotten as a country."
"10624700","10627700"," But we bitch in mode, but we don't tell them what we want to happen. "
"10629820","10632720"," What they do is they make laws that obtuse skates."
"10645340","10647620"," CBTC, heading 100,000, the long term."
"10649260","10650980"," It's by gapping up and parking right. "
"10653280","10653980"," No limit."
"10658180","10659960"," I should hear a bit of all those bitcoins."
"10662700","10664060"," And they asked me, it's kind of amazing. "
"10664400","10667000"," I thought CB Diamond said a few months ago, Brick Diamond was worth."
"10667160","10667860"," I was like, yeah, no shit."
"10671500","10672660"," Yeah, no shit with Bitcoin. "
"10679020","10680940"," By breakdown, spy tanking."
"10681820","10682880"," Watch every one of you over the city."
"10683000","10684720"," You're more on your news than most of the day around the week. "
"10684720","10686220"," And that bearish roll over stands."
"10686460","10687700"," OPEC's market's going up."
"10687920","10688680"," Super short calls. "
"10692830","10694010"," Yeah, I'm still bearish."
"10694510","10695650"," And I still trade calls."
"10698950","10701070"," I don't know a single bank that doesn't do that. "
"10705350","10706890"," 40 bears are going to get trapped."
"10707830","10708830"," 466 to be enough."
"10709010","10710170"," I haven't even checked my calls. "
"10711210","10712310"," I'm not looking at my calls."
"10714090","10719550"," They're worth $0.07 now."
"10719650","10723690"," I need the market to die right now. "
"10723790","10725030"," I really appreciate explaining the rationale."
"10725290","10725910"," I'm not trying to bother."
"10726150","10726990"," Yeah, you're not bothering me. "
"10729890","10732590"," It's hard for some people to wrap their heads around."
"10734190","10736690"," It's hard for people to wrap their heads around."
"10738970","10743630"," Most of the time, I don't know what this is. "
"10747740","10749700"," There's not a lot of movement on pen."
"10753290","10755270"," Pen slow, slow movement ticker."
"10757470","10761410"," It's hard for people to wrap their heads around. "
"10762690","10763650"," Are you bullish?"
"10763970","10764430"," Are you bearish?"
"10765070","10767110"," The context that you're bullish or bearish?"
"10767850","10770610"," It's impact in what you're doing at the moment."
"10773350","10776430"," It's oftentimes that most account is two things too."
"10776850","10783410"," There's a lot of conceit or trolling because you have people that want. "
"10786430","10788750"," They'll say someone will say something to you like."
"10789050","10792930"," Are you bearish or question like are you bullish on spy right now at this moment?"
"10794030","10794930"," I'm going to ask you that."
"10795010","10797610"," You bearish or bullish on spy right now. "
"10797970","10799150"," Once you say, well, it's bullish."
"10799550","10800730"," Let's say spy sells off."
"10802370","10803390"," Spy sells off. "
"10804330","10811810"," If you were to take a put at that moment while you're bullish on spy, let's say you take a"
"10811810","10813950"," put and then you start printing the put side."
"10814850","10817290"," That same person will come to you and say, well, wait a minute."
"10817370","10818210"," You just said you're bullish. "
"10818490","10819450"," You shouldn't be taking puts."
"10819450","10827570"," But my answer to that is always that that person that you're talking to out there doesn't pay your"
"10827570","10827890"," bills."
"10828710","10832250"," So you have to cover and protect your long position. "
"10832630","10838830"," If the trade goes the wrong way, you either have to roll close or reposition yourself or take the"
"10838830","10839630"," other side of that trade."
"10840210","10841490"," So you're constantly making money."
"10842170","10848890"," Oftentimes new traders fall into new investors fall into a whole of, well, I believe in this"
"10848890","10851230"," company and this company is going to go up no matter what. "
"10851690","10853430"," That's cute from the prime example, right?"
"10854490","10858790"," In reality, all it is is then they're listening to positive news, negative news."
"10859390","10861010"," And the reality is it's just profit taking."
"10861550","10866350"," You've got people taking profits and it's overvalued at that point and they're going to buy it"
"10866350","10870950"," again once we know it starts to see positive news come back into a stock again and you'll see all"
"10870950","10873610"," these pumps in the stock and it's just people taking profit on it. "
"10873610","10883050"," So I think people get locked into the bull bear thesis and ultimately"
"10883050","10889090"," the guy that you're talking to on social media, whether it be like Wall Street Bats or Twitter or"
"10889090","10891150"," YouTube or watching some videos somewhere."
"10891710","10897890"," Ultimately, if you get caught into that trap, you don't know who the person you're talking to is if"
"10897890","10900210"," they're actually a trader, actually an investor."
"10901170","10903990"," And then you're succumbing to blowing up your account. "
"10904590","10909290"," When they say nine out of ten traders or investors lose all their money, those are the people who"
"10909290","10909770"," lose all their money."
"10910370","10914790"," They get trapped, I guess, would be my take on it."
"10916150","10921910"," And to, I have to do this or I have to be a believer or I have to be constantly"
"10921910","10923310"," positioned for this to happen. "
"10927010","10934410"," They have to protect the trades at all times, manage your protection and the amount of protection"
"10934410","10939050"," that you put on can go up and down depending upon the position of the spy or any other whatever"
"10939050","10940130"," your training, it doesn't matter."
"10942880","10944720"," The spy looks like it's about to start rolling over here."
"10945280","10946880"," We check to see if there's any flow coming in. "
"10948000","10949920"," I'm not on the flow chart either."
"10955090","10955450"," Okay."
"10959010","10959370"," 1201. "
"10962710","10963390"," Okay."
"10963510","10970730"," At 1156, there was spy puts, February 11th, 450p, $81,000."
"10973270","10976210"," Watching QQQ calls for $38,000. "
"10976390","10977390"," I think I talked about both of those."
"10977730","10981610"," Board puts February 11th, 18p for $24,000."
"10983090","10985390"," CFLT, high algo score. "
"10985390","10994570"," C, Charlie, Foxtrot, Lima, Tango, February 18th, 75c for $377 "
"10994570","10995650",",000."
"10996010","11000970"," CFLT, February 18th, 85c for $190,000."
"11009300","11014360"," Yeah, I've been noticing the uptick in hot stocks everywhere. "
"11015080","11018000"," People that shouldn't be talking about them are talking about them a lot, a lot."
"11023510","11024890"," I don't know who McDonald is."
"11027250","11028050"," Oh, McDonald's. "
"11030620","11034380"," I'm going to look up a CRSR. Hold on."
"11039900","11041600"," I'm not paying a ton of attention. "
"11043300","11053100"," Just look up to"
"11053100","11054820"," CRSR and then APO."
"11064090","11064830"," Let me take a look."
"11065230","11065410"," I'm unsure. "
"11065710","11066510"," I'm in some spy calls."
"11067070","11068510"," So I think we break to the upside."
"11069490","11071050"," I don't think we sell off today. "
"11071210","11071370"," We might."
"11071370","11075650"," We could sell off as deep as 450 and then make a move to 460."
"11077010","11082150"," Now, as we get closer to OPEX, I'm going to trade the move to 460. "
"11084570","11085870"," I want to see those calls."
"11086250","11087570"," The puts burn off for today."
"11094870","11097190"," I was not showing today's rally is interesting. "
"11099410","11101290"," Yeah, Apple's holding its own down below."
"11102570","11104550"," Tesla looks like it's holding its own still."
"11104550","11106430"," I don't like XLF. "
"11106690","11107270"," Oh, you know what?"
"11108430","11111290"," XLF is selling off and XLU is turning up."
"11112190","11116030"," So that might be lending itself towards a sell off right now."
"11121150","11122990"," Amazon seems stalled too. "
"11123530","11125990"," Apple too mainly driven by all the heavily short stocks."
"11126330","11129890"," It seems Apple's a safety net for banks."
"11133720","11138800"," Yeah, I haven't traded pot stocks since the first pot stock pump that was like six years ago or so. "
"11138800","11143940"," Yeah, like that fucking six years ago, five or six years ago, whatever pot stocks."
"11144520","11147060"," The first, the first wave of pot stock mania."
"11148360","11152160"," And then like the last year there was a mania of last year before there was a mania in pot"
"11152160","11152380"," stocks. "
"11152480","11153220"," And I was like, fuck no."
"11153660","11154700"," I can't ever trade those again."
"11164030","11165810"," J&J is being off loaded before a dump. "
"11166210","11170050"," I said, deal big today, make it lucky and then I have to reverse put to avoid delisting."
"11172850","11176050"," I don't like seeing the rollover on XLF."
"11177370","11179670"," That might show that spies in a rollover here. "
"11181630","11183810"," Let me take a look at my my stanks here."
"11186570","11188670"," We've got a hundred contracts on."
"11200790","11209240"," I was rolling over slightly spies looking like it's rolling over. "
"11209400","11211160"," Vix is peeking its head up."
"11211880","11214360"," Yeah, we can see some pretty decent selling here."
"11221530","11223010"," Let's see if we get a rollover in the market. "
"11223470","11228610"," Lots of interest, 170,000 contracts on 455 P."
"11229610","11235340"," Those are 85 cents for February 9th."
"11240920","11249610"," Tesla looks like it's touching its lower support as well as Apple."
"11259260","11259940"," We'll see. "
"11267820","11272580"," Watching puts on XLF February 11th, 41 P."
"11273340","11274860"," $145,000."
"11289450","11290190"," All right."
"11299520","11302040"," I forgot all about the Fed speakers today. "
"11307750","11310710"," Messers hawkish at 12 o'clock."
"11311570","11313050"," I wonder we're selling off slightly."
"11313230","11314790"," I forgot all about the Fed speakers today. "
"11321360","11322300"," Senator Shelby."
"11323900","11325160"," I didn't have my headphones on."
"11325240","11326180"," I wasn't listening to the news. "
"11327840","11333000"," I forget what I think there was two Fed speakers today."
"11352290","11354270"," You had Messers speaking at noon."
"11366940","11370180"," Looks like I'm going to have to add to my spy calls at some point. "
"11376430","11379150"," I'm giving it Messer live right now on YouTube."

"11440730","11446150"," I've been following the crypto couple that had the $4.5 billion scam. "
"11446650","11449610"," I thought that was the other couple that lost all their money."
"11456920","11460380"," I'm not seeing Messers' speech being televised live."
"11460980","11462220"," I'm reading something here. "
"11462500","11469180"," I didn't have my headphones on, so I wasn't listening to trade the news, but it says here."
"11469320","11470520"," I'll read this to you if you didn't already."
"11470660","11474040"," I'll repeat it. "
"11474040","11480840"," A Fed's master FOMC voter hawkish supports active MBS sales as part of balance sheet wind down."

"11490720","11493320"," Inflation rate higher labor market tighter"
"11493320","11501240"," than 2015. "
"11502240","11504200"," And I don't know if I buy that one."
"11506000","11508740"," Conditions warrant balance sheet reduction starts him."
"11508900","11510840"," He's inflation rate moderating. "
"11511900","11520240"," I guess that of course the rate will be above 2% in 2022 and 2023."
"11521750","11525930"," Lorne flash readings depend on Fed taking policy action."
"11525970","11526890"," That's bullshit. "
"11546060","11550480"," No, I'm streaming trade the news, but I didn't know if you guys got."
"11550840","11554660"," I didn't have my headphones on, so I wasn't listening to hear if he was talking in the background"
"11554660","11555180"," or not."
"11555680","11557020"," I didn't have my monitor on. "
"11557540","11558880"," I got some problems with headphones."
"11559100","11563980"," I had a pair of headphones that suck, and then I've got a pair of headphones that I bought."
"11563980","11567040"," I need to now get a volume control for the monitor. "
"11567400","11569540"," It's just technical bullshit."
"11570740","11578300"," All right, so I'm watching MU calls March 4, 95C for $178,000."
"11578480","11585580"," Hi, I'll go score QQQ calls February 9, 366C for $32,000. "
"11590160","11592100"," All small cap stuff."
"11592400","11595380"," He puts on some small cap stuff."
"11595740","11600280"," He discs the ISCK, BRLT. "
"11600620","11602700"," These are all like stocks are at $12, $25."
"11603780","11605180"," AA calls."
"11606290","11609880"," Some of you guys are trading airlines, so we've got American Airlines. "
"11610780","11611760"," No, it's AA."
"11612120","11612780"," That's American Airlines."
"11613120","11614380"," That's AA. "
"11614720","11617180"," Isn't that a..."
"11617800","11618540"," Do you call it?"
"11618800","11619180"," That's an alcohol."
"11619540","11620080"," Is that alcohol?"
"11621900","11622860"," Yeah, it is alcohol."
"11624580","11629560"," AA March 18, 75C, $620,000. "
"11631100","11634420"," Now I've got two sets of puts on key."
"11634420","11636200"," K-E-E-Y."
"11636620","11638700"," March 18, 27P. "
"11639140","11641120"," First set was for $125,000."
"11641640","11644800"," Second set was for $69,000."
"11645300","11646820"," That's March 18, 27P. "
"11647320","11648780"," More puts on XLF."
"11649520","11650460"," March 11."
"11651300","11652100"," Excuse me, scratch that. "
"11652440","11655260"," February 11, 41P for $300,000."
"11660570","11662890"," Don't like seeing those puts on XLF."
"11663050","11665390"," That's the back door they're going to try to use to drop the spy. "
"11698090","11701290"," See if that support's still there down there on the spy or not."
"11701930","11702850"," Looks like it disappeared."
"11706610","11708090"," Keep your eye down here. "
"11708950","11713030"," You want to see if this support stays at $4.54. 68 or if it disappears."
"11744920","11750180"," And I also want to show you a note here that you're watching on the VIX, this nice bottoming"
"11750180","11752420"," pattern here on today, right?"
"11752800","11761080"," Bottoming pattern is $20.27. The daily SMA is curling up to support the VIX here."
"11761700","11763380"," Even if spy is turning up right now. "
"11767010","11769550"," There's not a lot of runway left on the spy."
"11770410","11777350"," So consider that too as a trade forward, that you need runway between now and the volatility that's"
"11777350","11778670"," expected at the end of the day."
"11779290","11786330"," Between 12 PM and 3 PM, you're going to want to see if there's a bid in the market for"
"11786330","11792430"," companies that are reporting tomorrow, end of day, and tomorrow or if we sell off, right?"
"11792510","11797650"," So look at the interplay and do these tickers get any kind of a bid into the end of the"
"11797650","11799010"," day between now and 4 PM?"
"11799570","11801070"," Or 3 PM, let's call it, right?"
"11801570","11802690"," Do these tickers get a bid?"
"11803530","11805290"," Or do we have like, I think we have 180. "
"11806230","11808870"," Let's take a look and see how many have been actually reporting today."
"11818780","11826000"," So we have 246 companies reporting today, before and after the bell."
"11826180","11828280"," It's a significant number of companies reporting today. "
"11829160","11833660"," So the question becomes, do we sell off the market into the close?"
"11837920","11844940"," Or do we at least trade up into, let's say, the 3 o'clock hour to see more volatility between"
"11844940","11845860"," 3 and 4 PM?"
"11847040","11852180"," So that would ask the question of, do we trade up into the 460 mark?"
"11852780","11855580"," We also have lots of puts rolling off the market today as well."
"11855820","11860020"," We've got some value of puts going down as well."
"11860140","11863700"," You've got bears reloading where we are to get that interplay, right?"
"11863800","11864820"," You get the bears reloading. "
"11865080","11868820"," You've got bears reloading."
"11868900","11872080"," You've got put decay for where we are."
"11872080","11873860"," So we're up at 4.56, right?"
"11873980","11880040"," If we close at that 460, you're going to destroy the value of some puts that were taken out a"
"11880040","11881900"," long time ago, let's call it a month prior. "
"11883000","11885340"," So bears are hoping for us to sell off and end the day."
"11886640","11890240"," But you've got reports coming out today too in a large number of them."
"11891100","11895880"," We just had some spy calls come in February 9th, 4.53 C for $300,000. "
"11897720","11900720"," So think about the runway that we have available for the rest of today."
"11902540","11908560"," And the interplay market wide, regardless of where people are positioning themselves."
"11909400","11914940"," So I guess if you're a bear, you want to be holding fast until maybe 3 PM into the 4"
"11914940","11918360"," o'clock hour and see if we get some volatility as we head into the close. "
"11919500","11925300"," The only concern that I would have would be if the CPI numbers are in line or if we already"
"11925300","11934580"," know this that we've got high inflation, then you might not print puts tomorrow on the CPI numbers."
"11934840","11940960"," The safer bet is to trade calls on the VIX for tomorrow."
"11946100","11948940"," And even then, you only hold the VIX until..."
"11951530","11955830"," I don't know if you can even hold the VIX until because the CPI is before market opens. "
"11955830","11961370"," So maybe the better trade is to sell the VIX after tomorrow."
"11963090","11964790"," Not really thinking that through enough."
"11966290","11967730"," You'd sell the VIX at the bell. "
"11973140","11979260"," Apple calls, February 11th, 177.5 C, $39,000, and video calls."
"11980300","11984400"," Still loading on those, February 18th, 300 C for $115,000."
"11987180","11989200"," The CPI number is going to be tough for me. "
"11991020","12000040"," I was expecting a really bearish take on CPI, and now I'm wondering if the cat's out of the bag"
"12000040","12010000"," so much that you really need some really, really bad, ugly, ugly numbers for sell the"
"12010000","12010340"," market."
"12011380","12015340"," Sometimes they'll still sell the market just because even if the numbers aren't that bad."
"12017020","12019440"," Two, so you have to consider that into your plan for tomorrow. "
"12020480","12022420"," But, you know, we're at Worm Wednesday."
"12022820","12027360"," The market's been fairly green this week, so we do need a down day."
"12028100","12034720"," It would seem logical if we would have a down later today and a down tomorrow, just for having one"
"12034720","12036380"," day down this week, at least. "
"12048600","12053580"," I'd say give the bulls until about 2 PM to another hour and a half."
"12055720","12058800"," If the bulls can do it the next hour and a half, let's do it."
"12059080","12063820"," If the bulls can't do it the next hour and a half, I'm going to give it to the bears. "
"12065800","12068080"," We'll look here and see if we can see."
"12084210","12090370"," Yeah, I heard a guy last night, late last night was talking about CPI and the guy that I trust."
"12091290","12098760"," He was like, he's like, he made a good point. "
"12098900","12105480"," He was like, he's like, we've had so much fucking doom and gloom that it can only be, you know,"
"12105820","12106540"," fucking rainbows."
"12106840","12113060"," You know, same shit the other day with the employment jobs numbers, right?"
"12113580","12118620"," An ADP telling us one thing and then we've got the federal government telling us some completely"
"12118620","12119180"," fucking different."
"12119180","12120720"," We still sold up. "
"12132620","12133260"," Slow day."
"12138730","12139690"," Super slow day."
"12146980","12149300"," Yeah, a lot of reversals do happen around two or five. "
"12150600","12155500"," And we had, you know, Ed Metzer speaking at 12 o'clock, so maybe Metzer's speech is over at this"
"12155500","12155760"," point."
"12156260","12157340"," I'm not seeing anything here."
"12159860","12163680"," I'm not getting a lot of, uh..."
"12164280","12165180"," Are we fucking?"
"12165580","12167260"," Oh, are we playing the global?"
"12167460","12169700"," You're listening to Trade the New. "
"12169820","12173320"," Yeah, I'm not getting a real slow day today."
"12176320","12177620"," Take it all to the grade again."
"12179300","12181080"," I missed a bunch of what you guys are saying. "
"12181240","12182100"," I was looking at some other stuff."
"12182860","12184220"," Did spy buyers move up?"
"12184420","12186500"," I'm sure we're perfectly observing all the buyers."
"12186680","12189780"," A lot of reversals happen at two or five. "
"12192500","12194260"," Do I believe in VIX TA?"
"12197300","12198640"," Eurobimmer, I believe you."
"12199200","12200960"," I am in agreement with you, Eurobimmer."
"12201760","12204380"," I don't think for a while VIX is going below 20. "
"12207680","12209680"," I don't think he's, I like Eurobimmer."
"12210160","12211340"," Eurobimmer knows what he's doing."
"12212980","12214060"," Yeah, it's Alcoa. "
"12225920","12229030"," I trade the VIX."
"12230090","12231270"," I trade the VIX though."
"12232170","12234330"," I pay a lot of attention to the VIX, I should say. "
"12240160","12241880"," Brands like Nike have a common fit."
"12242160","12243260"," They have a lot of not paying workers."
"12245760","12247480"," Yeah, no, I'm streaming it. "
"12247480","12253540"," Yeah, I trade the news is on."
"12253840","12257940"," They're just not verbalizing anything right now."
"12258220","12258660"," It's on. "
"12259360","12260400"," I just got nothing to say."
"12260540","12261980"," I think it's just a slow news day right now."
"12269690","12270990"," I think that's all it is. "
"12279460","12282960"," Someone else's comment that we've got a 10-year auction in 40 minutes."
"12304750","12309950"," One of the here indicators, you know, it's still negative, but it's turning less negative right"
"12309950","12310250"," now."
"12310790","12312670"," I've seen some calls coming into the market as well. "
"12314150","12315150"," AMD calls again."
"12317270","12319150"," February 11th, 135C."
"12319410","12320090"," Let's think of look at AMD. "
"12320590","12325030"," AMD's been, sorry, I forgot to do CRSR. You guys got to bother me and be like, what the fuck's"
"12325030","12325890"," going on with this stuff?"
"12326750","12327670"," I'm getting lost here."
"12329070","12331470"," I'm like, man, I just want to break out a hammock and take a nap. "
"12332750","12334090"," Come back to my calls later."
"12335170","12340750"," Alright, let's look at the CRSR. More sellers than buyers. "
"12344290","12345670"," Nice, I like where it's at."
"12346590","12348830"," Working on 23, then 26, then 27."
"12349870","12350970"," All you're right on support. "
"12353210","12358430"," Nexty, reportedly considering the sale of its 1 billion euro by now, pay a later unit rate."
"12359890","12361710"," Remember, I go X-ray Indian Mulah."
"12367720","12370840"," 1940, sick buyers of 20 bucks, trying to trade it up. "
"12372640","12373520"," The $21."
"12376280","12386020"," Pretty decent sale at 20, 98 on CRSR. Yep, smoke them if you got them. "
"12386200","12393300"," Like, there isn't really much that we can talk about right now in terms of what's going on, right?"
"12393300","12395380"," We're in this channel that we're trading in."
"12395980","12400840"," We're at Ask Channel going on since yesterday."
"12407350","12414450"," Next sale on the spy looks like 457.20. Next big sale. "
"12415950","12416490"," Looks like it."
"12437490","12440170"," Market maker's just sucking premium out of calls and puts."
"12460740","12462260"," That was a pretty big move overnight. "
"12463780","12467420"," Looking at more AMD calls."
"12467760","12471240"," I forgot we're going to look at AMD next because the calls on AMD have been coming in all day"
"12471240","12471500"," long."
"12480460","12482280"," You guys were talking about trade ticks earlier. "
"12484500","12487260"," I placed it along the trade ticks."
"12488020","12488480"," I got rid of it."
"12490040","12491720"," I liked the wealth of information. "
"12493640","12496360"," I didn't like, I felt like it wasn't."
"12496480","12497300"," I felt like it wasn't."
"12498860","12500940"," I thought there was too much information. "
"12510400","12512720"," I know that some people like all that information."
"12515040","12516160"," Let's see on spy."
"12518800","12519320"," 4743732. "
"12520220","12522260"," I had to get that at 47474."
"12524380","12533810"," A little bit of resistance here."
"12533810","12535390"," A little bit of ice here at 4658. "
"12538130","12539430"," Not major though."
"12544430","12545750"," This stuff up here."
"12554160","12557040"," Put some add-ons here. "
"12559460","12561580"," What are you guys interested in for?"
"12564540","12565840"," You guys want to go over?"
"12569640","12572280"," You guys want to go over some of these ER plays for today?"
"12575950","12577510"," Like thoughts on the air plays."
"12583180","12584380"," AMD is interesting."
"12586580","12590980"," There's a ton of buyers on AMD. "
"12593340","12594840"," 82 to 67."
"12596200","12598160"," Here are indicators super hell-green."
"12599540","12600780"," At resistance right now. "
"12600780","12607640"," If they break above, if they do break through this 132, next move up is 135."
"12608280","12609760"," That's a big move for AMD."
"12611440","12612600"," Price started at 140. "
"12613840","12617620"," And still a lot of sellers up here at 140."
"12619560","12620940"," Do you like that trade though?"
"12623380","12632070"," If they can get through this and take it to 135."
"12634710","12636570"," We have some clear skies up here too. "
"12638650","12639750"," There's a push on AMD."
"12642310","12644890"," We should trade AMD one day, but for like a week."
"12645870","12648810"," First of your new trader, AMD is a great ticker to trade. "
"12651450","12652190"," Very forgiving."
"12656040","12657620"," Do some due diligence on it."
"12657880","12659320"," I used to trade AMD as one of the first. "
"12659320","12663620"," Like I started out trading in Spy, of course, and then trading individual tickers."
"12664140","12669300"," Then before you start trading Tesla and Apple and all these other tickers, like a tick-ass, tick "
"12669300","12670180","-ass stock trade."
"12673500","12674480"," They're very forgiving. "
"12675160","12677640"," I'm looking at all the reporting results."
"12680240","12684760"," I want to collect sales of 11.2%. That's better than most annual sales expectations."

"13192340","13193480"," Like I'm looking at spreads on Disney."
"13194160","13195180"," There ain't shit. "
"13196600","13202680"," You probably have to do something really wonky-like."
"13214960","13218600"," Like you do something really wonky-like on Facebook or on Disney."
"13218800","13219920"," You do like, let me see. "
"13227250","13229810"," That's for saying this fed moves toward rate increases."
"13230230","13235010"," She sees no trade off between the jobs and inflation mandates."
"13236570","13239330"," Watching lots of Facebook calls coming in right now. "
"13239530","13241050"," More Nvidia calls as well."
"13242750","13248250"," On February 11th, there's 11,000 contracts out on Disney at 150 C."
"13248610","13249150"," They're very expensive."
"13249450","13251010"," They're $2.95 a piece. "
"13251830","13256130"," More Facebook calls, February 11th, 232.5 C, $84,000."
"13257810","13261090"," I mean, even the put side is too expensive."
"13262230","13264330"," But here's a key takeaway. "
"13266710","13270610"," So let's say I'm kind of bullish on Disney."
"13271190","13274250"," Now unless it opens, let's say by the 11th, it's flat."
"13274530","13275990"," Let's look at the 18th, just in case. "
"13277190","13278010"," It might even be better."
"13279210","13280970"," So look at it from this perspective, right?"
"13281390","13284370"," On the 18th, February 18th for Disney."
"13291960","13294560"," If there's zero interest over here, it's kind of surprising. "
"13297540","13299860"," Not a lot of interest in Disney going down."
"13300600","13301600"," I wonder why that is."
"13302720","13304380"," Everybody knows everybody knows, maybe?"
"13307770","13309270"," Like just a wing and a prayer?"
"13311510","13316850"," That's for saying that she's expect fed will need to get rates above neutral, but doesn't see an"
"13316850","13317970"," immediate need to do that. "
"13318590","13318970"," Uh oh."
"13319470","13319930"," That's bullish."
"13320870","13324390"," Okay, so like there's no interest on this, but like February 18th, you could take a good one. "
"13324490","13328770"," He's bank of Canada governor saying businesses are telling them will take some time for his flying"
"13328770","13330230"," chain challenges to normalize."
"13331230","13334010"," Oh, just a heads up that makes this shit in the bed."
"13334550","13336670"," All right, so this is kind of a bizarre trade. "
"13336990","13337730"," No one's in on this trade."
"13337870","13338330"," I don't know why."
"13338790","13343030"," We're not a Texas of the fire in Houston's industrial sector. "
"13344870","13346430"," But you could take like a 120."
"13346910","13347510"," You could take a ferry."
"13347850","13348090"," Black smoke. "
"13348450","13349090"," God damn it."
"13349090","13349390"," Rising."
"13349790","13350630"," Stop talking, bro. "
"13350970","13352770"," Charlie, shut the fuck up."
"13355170","13358910"," Okay, so you could do like February 18th, 120 P."
"13359970","13361730"," They're 51 cents, right?"
"13365530","13367710"," And then you do like a, I need to do like a."
"13372680","13374020"," Yeah, I don't know if that would pay out."
"13374200","13375780"," I was looking at the 150 C."
"13378860","13379740"," February 18th. "
"13379740","13389740"," I don't"
"13389740","13389960"," know."
"13390420","13392460"," I don't like anything on Disney."
"13393540","13396120"," Okay, so snow calls February 18th. "
"13397480","13399360"," 290 C, $200,000."
"13401160","13402560"," Man, I don't like anything on Disney."
"13402820","13404680"," I don't like the price of anything on Disney. "
"13405200","13406340"," And I just looked at spreads."
"13406880","13409040"," I just looked at straddles."
"13410420","13411900"," I'm not like in any of it. "
"13415730","13416130"," You know what?"
"13416230","13416570"," You know what?"
"13416650","13416970"," You know what?"
"13417050","13417630"," There's about Disney."
"13420240","13422960"," Give it a high chance that it fucking opens flat tomorrow."
"13423280","13423920"," No matter what the. "
"13425340","13426520"," The ER is."
"13426980","13427980"," What do you guys think about Disney?"
"13434890","13436530"," Deploy emergency black swan."
"13440010","13441250"," Deploy the swans. "
"13445270","13448090"," Yeah, I'm looking at Disney on both sides, right?"
"13448870","13451110"," We were looking for quick when the step of the fun."
"13451650","13452090"," It's weird."
"13452250","13453770"," I'm looking at the chain on Disney. "
"13453770","13455350"," I'm like, I don't like it."
"13455350","13457350"," She's not the Fed's primary policy tool."
"13458510","13459350"," Oh, dude. "
"13460330","13463190"," She's just master needs to shut the fuck up."
"13470630","13472030"," Yeah, maybe a Disney calendar."
"13476400","13477640"," I haven't looked at Twitter yet. "
"13478280","13478740"," It's weird."
"13479040","13479260"," I'm looking."
"13479580","13481460"," It depends on the ticker that I'm looking at. "
"13487110","13488750"," You know what's funny is the."
"13490750","13491170"," The."
"13492530","13492990"," Well, no. "
"13493110","13494110"," So what problem is this?"
"13494790","13496210"," I'm looking at the options, Shane and Disney."
"13497050","13499870"," And it looks like they're going to fucking fuck everybody."
"13501370","13503410"," It doesn't look like anybody's getting paid. "
"13504910","13505910"," Okay, that's back."
"13506030","13507330"," I'm saying rising path and rates."
"13507790","13508850"," It's not mean one increase. "
"13509130","13510130"," It's multiple increases."
"13511310","13512170"," Jesus master."
"13515930","13516810"," Okay, MD. "
"13517730","13520930"," February 11th, 125 C, $800,000."
"13521870","13523110"," It's really bizarre right now."
"13523190","13525230"," I'm like looking at the chain for Disney. "
"13526690","13527750"," Don't like it."
"13532050","13533570"," It wouldn't shock me to see."
"13534010","13537290"," Wouldn't shock me to see Disney just be flat. "
"13538750","13541050"," Or at least by the open B flat."
"13544660","13548940"," I'd say the safest trade on Disney is a far out call like months."
"13550460","13552780"," Six months, nine months right where we are. "
"13553200","13553520"," The year."
"13554500","13556060"," Or just by stock."
"13557520","13560520"," And then if it trades down, sell puts at like 117. "
"13561620","13564600"," If you trade it down to like 117 or so, just like some puts on it."
"13565600","13566600"," Take your money back."
"13569070","13569870"," Disney's a hard one. "
"13570090","13570650"," You know what it is too?"
"13570790","13571710"," It's got so much."
"13572130","13572830"," It's got so much."
"13573070","13573970"," So many people watching it. "
"13577450","13578670"," I like the Disney trade."
"13578990","13580250"," I'm bullish on Disney in the clothes."
"13580430","13582790"," If you want to know like my which way I'm leaning. "
"13584050","13588450"," I'm saying you see is not on autopilot with its rate half."
"13588890","13591470"," They make a decision at each point."
"13592230","13594930"," There's like Jay Paus screaming in her airpiece or some right now. "
"13595330","13598530"," The only other concern I would have for Disney would be it would sell off into the clothes today."
"13598530","13600570"," The last thing I would have to say about Disney."
"13601030","13603350"," If you're going to buy Disney stock, I would wait until. "
"13604610","13605650"," Like rain for the bell."
"13606350","13608130"," Unless someone knows some we don't know."
"13608710","13609990"," More Facebook calls. "
"13610730","13611770"," February 11th, 235."
"13612130","13613390"," That's not a good ticket we're looking at."
"13613830","13614590"," I don't like. "
"13614770","13616130"," I think there's easier trades than Disney."
"13616830","13617030"," Facebook."
"13617830","13620330"," February 11th, 235 C hundred twenty thousand dollars. "
"13621050","13625850"," And video more calls February or February 25th, 265 C."
"13625850","13628630"," Four twenty four and twenty six thousand dollars."
"13628890","13629830"," All over in video today."
"13630090","13631550"," All over Facebook past hour. "
"13632050","13633810"," AMD's been all day long."
"13636110","13637850"," You know how Disney trades too, right?"
"13638650","13642670"," Like Disney is such a such a frustrating ticker to trade."
"13644490","13645790"," Alright, so I'm going to get off to Disney. "
"13646590","13647490"," I'm going to stop talking about Disney."
"13648030","13648770"," Next up, Uber."
"13650710","13651570"," Let's look at Uber. "
"13668550","13669490"," Man, I like Uber."
"13670870","13672170"," Just buy the stock."
"13674650","13675890"," That's all I'm going to say, I love Uber. "
"13677710","13678890"," And everybody hates Uber."
"13679350","13680070"," But I like where it's at."
"13684550","13685730"," Launched in 2019. "
"13687090","13688690"," It's basically right where it should be."
"13688910","13689670"," Thirty seven dollars."
"13691130","13692510"," I'm bullish on Uber too. "
"13695910","13697810"," It's showing it because it's already up to forty bucks."
"13698150","13700050"," It was trading down below at thirty four."
"13701630","13705230"," I'm going to assume then that it's implied ranges down to thirty five. "
"13705230","13707990"," Or forty five."
"13710740","13712020"," I just like that stock."
"13712580","13713740"," I like the price of that stock. "
"13718060","13720680"," Spy February ninth, four fifty three C."
"13722160","13723960"," Two hundred fifteen thousand dollars."
"13726160","13727560"," I like the price of Uber."
"13727860","13729220"," Like just buying that stock. "
"13729400","13730520"," Why play the play trade?"
"13730720","13731760"," I'd say just buy some of it."
"13732480","13734360"," South calls and puts make money off it."
"13736220","13738420"," That's all I've got to say on Uber too. "
"13744340","13745600"," Spy is looking kind of bullish."
"13750920","13752440"," Looks like my calls are coming back."
"13752520","13754760"," I've averaged in a couple of times on those spy calls. "
"13755560","13757300"," But a bunch nice and cheap."
"13758060","13759340"," Starting to break even."
"13762560","13763360"," TLT puts. "
"13763840","13764240"," Good to see."
"13765580","13768060"," February four, excuse me, March fourth, one thirty four P."
"13769400","13770520"," More spy calls."
"13771140","13772480"," Big money coming into spy right now. "
"13772600","13775740"," Spy calls February ninth, four fifty three."
"13776620","13778000"," Close to half million dollars."
"13781800","13782740"," We'll see what happens. "
"13782740","13783520"," We'll spread it out here."
"13783620","13784600"," See if it moves up or not."
"13797300","13799020"," Uber needs a lift after getting dashed. "
"13800120","13803040"," So like coming into ER for Uber."
"13804460","13805660"," It's so cheap."
"13806600","13807160"," Why bother?"
"13807680","13809060"," Just buy like buy some shares. "
"13810240","13811440"," As you can then sell calls."
"13811540","13812520"," You can sell puts."
"13814600","13818320"," We are reopening regardless of what everybody thinks. "
"13818460","13819060"," We are reopening."
"13819060","13820580"," It's not, I mean, it's talking about it."
"13821120","13827440"," It, it, uh, IPO had went not long ago, right?"
"13828780","13832200"," The, uh, Uber IPO was not that long ago. "
"13835710","13836710"," It's not going anywhere."
"13837850","13839550"," We're not getting taxis back."
"13840790","13844590"," You know, nothing for nothing like or dislike. "
"13844930","13848030"," Uber hate the gig economy."
"13848250","13848970"," It's not going anywhere."
"13849750","13854210"," It's that thirty seven bucks that IPO in May of 2019. "
"13854210","13855390"," It's trading."
"13857330","13860130"," And it's basically at its IPO price."
"13868390","13869590"," Just buy the stock. "
"13871570","13873390"," Look at silver and gold next."
"13876500","13881320"," That's better saying that that is still discussing what the actual balance sheet plan would look"
"13881320","13881620"," like."
"13888120","13894560"," That's saying that would not necessarily sell mortgage back securities from the start of the"
"13894560","13895260"," balance sheet reduction. "
"13897960","13898620"," Hell yeah."
"13898840","13899600"," Silver is looking bullish."
"13903820","13904300"," Super bullish. "
"13914420","13916520"," Bullish to 2240, right?"
"13916680","13917440"," You already know that though."
"13917520","13918280"," You don't need me to tell you."
"13918940","13925320"," The other thing I would say on that would be another target would be right above here at 2157. "
"13926680","13928360"," You don't want to see a rejection there."
"13928360","13929780"," You know what I would say on silver?"
"13930760","13931960"," This is my take on silver."
"13932120","13932280"," Are you ready?"
"13933300","13935060"," I bet silver rejects at 2186. "
"13936500","13940620"," It fades back down to 1980 and then you finally get your rip on silver heading into March."
"13942200","13943660"," And it lags gold usually."
"13944900","13945860"," So there I said it rejects. "
"13947640","13948520"," I'll do it gold."
"13955560","13958520"," If gold tells us anything about silver."
"13963160","13965120"," I'll expose it on the outside. "
"13965740","13966900"," Gold looks bullish too."
"13967640","13969780"," I know that the big talk has been."
"13970340","13971740"," I remember it would have failed before. "
"13972320","13974720"," Everyone was saying, well, what will it break through there and it didn't?"
"13979760","13981400"," I'm going to say rejects here too."
"13981580","13989920"," The gold rejects at 172.68. It trades below support to 163.90 and then it rips higher."
"13992970","13993590"," Don't hold me to that. "
"13993790","13996130"," I don't trade a lot of gold in silver."
"13996130","13999530"," I have, but I don't right now."
"14014280","14015460"," All right, so we're done with. "
"14016400","14019520"," We did silver, gold, uber, and Disney."
"14024680","14025520"," Let's see here."
"14036260","14036740"," CLF. "
"14038140","14038960"," Give me an oil."
"14040880","14042600"," I don't have futures on this."
"14042820","14043360"," I don't think. "
"14043640","14044500"," I used to have futures on this."
"14044680","14049280"," Are you cleaving cliffs?"
"14068140","14069860"," There's lots of grinding right now on the spot."
"14070160","14074000"," The price target above is 457.40 unless it comes back down to VWAP. "
"14075080","14083040"," VWAP seems to have moved up to 455.90. Loaden Coelop right now."
"14083620","14084160"," Facebook was on CNBC."
"14084740","14084960"," Thanks, Steve. "
"14085120","14085580"," We're saying something."
"14088220","14090920"," TQQ's doesn't show up well on book map."
"14097100","14099500"," I'm investing it into NYC medallions. "
"14100340","14102860"," Dude, that's some crazy shit on NYC medallions."
"14107920","14108480"," Yeah."
"14110480","14112200"," Yeah, they do crazy reporting. "
"14112620","14113160"," Cody's right."
"14113440","14115160"," The one thing about Uber is they do some."
"14115520","14117620"," They do the same shit that SQ does, right?"
"14118480","14124820"," Where they're allowed to do funky ass reporting where SQ is like, if you look at SQ's accounting"
"14124820","14126740"," practices, fucking disaster. "
"14137880","14139380"," Yeah, I agree with that, Henry as well."
"14140300","14145360"," I think my point though is that I think my point is that, yeah, CLF is steel."
"14146140","14147200"," I said oil, didn't I?"
"14148760","14149420"," Cleaving cliffs. "
"14150260","14155940"," So I was thinking about, um, so I'm going through all of your stuff right now."
"14156260","14156920"," You asked?"
"14157500","14159000"," That's PM ER tomorrow."
"14159580","14165460"," So, uh, I think that's my initial claim on it. "
"14165460","14170780"," So it doesn't matter if Uber is successful or if it gets merged into another company or somebody"
"14170780","14174780"," buys it, whatever it's, whatever it turns into or morphs into."
"14175360","14179800"," I think the key behind Uber and Lyft is that it's the future."
"14180400","14183320"," And like another one that I hate is like a hate dash as a company. "
"14183360","14184100"," I think they suck."
"14185600","14187620"," I don't like any of the delivery food businesses."
"14187860","14189420"," I can't believe people do delivery. "
"14190600","14191580"," I can't do it."
"14191740","14195700"," I've tried a million different services that never works for me, but I know it's the future."
"14196500","14197420"," And so that is important. "
"14198780","14202700"," And if the instruct, if the infrastructure is there, let's say Uber was like, we went bankrupt"
"14202700","14203160"," tomorrow."
"14203160","14203920"," We're going to go bankrupt."
"14205020","14208240"," They would pull a piton and they would be worth a lot of money. "
"14209500","14212260"," So I don't think it really matters whether they're profitable now or later."
"14213500","14214980"," But I look at Uber like a future."
"14216540","14218240"," I look at dash like the future. "
"14218480","14221020"," I think the food delivery is in its infancy here in the US."
"14221020","14228200"," I've lived in other countries and food delivery is leaps ahead of what we consider food delivery."
"14228500","14230000"," I don't think it's good for the American worker. "
"14231280","14235040"," But to say that that's not the future is irrational."
"14244140","14245360"," Yeah, Quinn does."
"14247760","14248520"," You know what I mean?"
"14248680","14252880"," It's not like I'm not really like fucking bullish on Uber per se. "
"14253280","14256140"," But yeah, the fees are absurd."
"14256360","14257020"," The whole thing is absurd."
"14257240","14258280"," The way we do it is absurd. "
"14259040","14260580"," Quinn keeps doing dash in business."
"14261900","14266420"," But I'm like, let's look at, let's look at, I'll look up CLF right now."
"14266920","14269080"," Like, seriously, let's look at like a piton. "
"14269200","14270300"," Do you think piton is the future?"
"14270880","14272340"," Or do you think Uber is the future?"
"14274600","14275340"," No offense."
"14276500","14277820"," Ooh, I like CLF."
"14278620","14279600"," Oh, yes, CLF. "
"14280860","14281700"," Nice bounce down below."
"14282120","14283000"," Look at this thing."
"14283820","14286260"," I have 20-30 looking for 21 bucks. "
"14287320","14288880"," Way more buyers than sellers."
"14290120","14297700"," We know that the Build Back America bill got some money coming out, right?"
"14297920","14299300"," So Build Back America play maybe."
"14300400","14301740"," We got 22 above. "
"14302000","14304860"," We do have a lot of sellers here, but your majority of your sellers are at 22 bucks."
"14305980","14307060"," But still, I like the buyers here."
"14307540","14308020"," I like CLF. "
"14314780","14316680"," Yeah, Taiwan's got bangin' food delivery."
"14317460","14318860"," Taiwan's got bangin' food delivery."
"14319120","14320840"," Japan's got okay food delivery. "
"14321300","14321780"," Not that good."
"14322220","14323460"," Korea had bad ass food delivery."
"14324560","14325640"," I'm in all those places. "
"14328040","14329040"," Oh, no, I've been to Taiwan."
"14329820","14330280"," I've been to Thailand."
"14334680","14335240"," Yeah, task rabbit. "
"14337120","14338300"," Yeah, a grab."
"14338600","14339360"," I like grab, too."
"14339760","14340640"," What do you guys think about?"
"14341520","14346800"," Like, if Pelton was like, oh, yeah, we bought a bought bike company. "
"14346800","14351900"," And we're going to go to the outdoors with our brand, right?"
"14352100","14353080"," We're going to become this company."
"14353240","14355220"," We're going to launch a clothing brand."
"14356020","14357380"," I like a little lemon or something. "
"14357660","14358420"," You like to be a brand."
"14358920","14360280"," Then I'd be like, yeah, fuck you."
"14360340","14361120"," I'll get behind Pelton. "
"14361360","14366340"," I just don't like that Pelton didn't do all this work that needs to be done for you to stay"
"14366340","14366760"," relevant."
"14368340","14372580"," You know, which pisses me off."
"14372920","14374860"," So when I see like a Uber or a door to add. "
"14374860","14379100"," Mr. saying that she believes long term Fed funds rate is around two and a half percent."
"14388800","14392860"," So, yeah, like, if you want to buy something in us, if you want to buy something right now, you're"
"14392860","14395600"," like, I need to buy something, stay involved, mark, keep money out of cash."
"14396080","14396380"," I don't know. "
"14396500","14397100"," Buy Uber, dude."
"14400460","14401940"," Dollar cost average into it."
"14402640","14403740"," Not a bad idea. "
"14404020","14405280"," I'd rather buy that than Pelton."
"14408700","14410640"," Comparing everything to Bell Pelton right now."
"14415560","14417040"," What is the war done, Dash?"
"14419600","14420720"," I love New York. "
"14422880","14423760"," I used to live there too."
"14424040","14424560"," I lived in New York."
"14425440","14427940"," Never lived in San Fran, but I spent a lot of time in San Francisco. "
"14432340","14434960"," Used to live in L.A. Not proper."
"14435080","14437340"," Used to live in a."
"14437860","14439280"," In a number in a del Rey."
"14440820","14442180"," North of the north of Venice. "
"14443680","14444660"," The fucking Paris will."
"14445940","14446580"," By the spot."
"14446920","14447220"," Many times. "
"14447480","14448420"," There's fucking Pelton."
"14448600","14449880"," There's a Pelton of Paris building here."
"14452560","14457290"," There's a bunch of Lux apartments. "
"14460030","14461070"," They still live in Midtown."
"14466290","14467110"," Pelton's in the building."
"14467330","14468210"," A bunch of Lux apartments. "
"14468490","14470350"," Like, like, like, like, like, like, like, like, Disney."
"14471010","14471930"," Don't, don't fuck with the mouse."
"14473470","14474550"," Peetown's been looking dumpy. "
"14474810","14477670"," For the electric vehicle market scene, you're worth it."
"14479170","14480990"," Secretary's grand home in Buttigieg."
"14481530","14484150"," Plan to make an EV charging network announcement. "
"14485270","14485730"," Uh-oh."
"14486490","14487410"," EV charging network."
"14488230","14488890"," Who does that help?"
"14489130","14490070"," Does that help PlayaGuard?"
"14490210","14491390"," Does it help, uh, charge the point?"
"14491950","14493070"," Taking higher on this report. "
"14493870","14494290"," The VLNK."
"14495230","14495670"," Oh, blink."
"14496770","14497510"," VLNK, baby. "
"14499330","14500550"," Look at Blanche points."
"14500830","14501670"," CHPT also."
"14502470","14503630"," That high is Charlie with help off. "
"14503630","14504950"," The charge point it has."
"14506350","14507450"," It could be on K."
"14512620","14516600"," Yeah, but like, or I didn't."
"14518500","14524800"," Like, I dislike Peloton once we started the reopening because I was like, I was like, why aren't"
"14524800","14526780"," they coming out with something for a reopening play?"
"14527200","14528040"," Like, they should know better. "
"14528240","14530260"," They should have been like, Johnny on the spot."
"14533080","14535200"," Like, the future is riding bikes at home."
"14535480","14536140"," Cool them down with that. "
"14536340","14537160"," You cornered that market."
"14537880","14545160"," Now that we're reopening, you have something for people to roll into, uh, a reopening play for"
"14545160","14545420"," yourself."
"14545620","14547200"," Do you talk about a wasted opportunity, too?"
"14550310","14550750"," Oh, yeah. "

"14660280","14663240"," Oh, T.L.T. just rocket ship up."
"14664220","14665440"," That can be a big turn. "

"14674980","14677120"," I'm currently Franklin, Victor, India."
"14681140","14683200"," Huge spike on T.L.T. currently. "
"14684060","14686160"," There's the C.F.V.I. moving out the lows."

"14691240","14691820"," At session highs. "
"14696740","14698840"," I guess that spot play was on Joe Rogan."
"14707100","14708540"," We saw this yesterday."
"14709400","14713900"," We saw the divergence in T.L.T. and the market. "
"14714320","14715800"," We're seeing it again at the moment."
"14716200","14718760"," I don't know how this plays out, but it's been a..."
"14718760","14725540"," We talk sometimes about how T.L.T. will convert, have convergence and divergence with tech, which"

"14729280","14731660"," T.L.T. or yields have not matched. "
"14732180","14736320"," Everybody's been saying yields are going to jump the market in reality."
"14736640","14737900"," It's been the opposite."
"14739880","14747300"," And you can see it cues on the highs at 365, 57, and then they spiked up right along with"
"14747300","14755320"," T.L.T. in yields and tech. "
"14761850","14764630"," I'm wondering how these spy puts play out right now."
"14768210","14771330"," Or is the trade against XLF and not the cues?"
"14782030","14789430"," The view up on the spy is 4.56. We'll look lower to see if there's anywhere else with more"
"14789430","14789910"," ice below."
"14799520","14815720"," 4.54.70. The"
"14815720","14819480"," trade is against financials and not necessarily the cues. "
"14832950","14834570"," Yeah, I'm used to catching a bit today."
"14845460","14847820"," CFBI is the competitor."
"14853160","14854860"," Yeah, that's the bank put, right?"
"14855200","14860120"," So you'll see maybe spy drop and cues stay just fine. "
"14862200","14865000"," I would be careful on the cues puts right now."
"14865260","14866400"," I don't think that trade..."
"14866400","14870540"," I don't think the cues have been divergent to bond yields currently."
"14871380","14873240"," Trades against financials and not the cues. "
"14884280","14885460"," More rivion calls."

"15021270","15023730"," I'm watching XLF right now. "
"15034980","15043200"," XLF is the prior low was 40.96 and it's retesting that low currently."
"15043660","15044780"," So this will be the second test."
"15045700","15047760"," We'll know which way the market moves here. "
"15050160","15052520"," This will be a deciding moment for the market."
"15064460","15065400"," We'll find out."
"15065600","15067360"," We are watching some blink calls come in. "
"15068000","15072240"," February 11th, 22.5C for $119,000."
"15075260","15079700"," Just to reiterate the MU calls from someone in the chat was bringing it up."
"15080200","15081080"," It was catching a bid. "
"15083700","15088200"," See if we can get that on here."
"15091200","15093260"," Sometimes a hero won't work on these tickers."
"15094300","15095560"," Nice on MU, right?"
"15095860","15100740"," Nice price target above, crashing through some resistance here, looking for $88. "
"15103220","15106520"," You have an error indicator that's positive on MU today."
"15107180","15108680"," More buyers than sellers on MU."
"15108940","15110280"," Good shout out on MU, by the way. "
"15113140","15118500"," We'll see if I'm watching XLF closely right now because they had a retest down below at 40.96."
"15120460","15123140"," Haven't seen more XLF puts."
"15124200","15126540"," Haven't seen a commitment earlier."
"15126900","15133120"," We saw all those XLF puts, but I haven't seen more rolling in at this point. "
"15133260","15134860"," So we'll just keep a close eye on it."
"15137320","15142340"," If the bottom is defended on XLF, you should see a move up in the spy."
"15142600","15145480"," If not, you'll see the spy with a pretty decent sell off. "
"15149950","15156340"," You saw some spoofing?"
"15163100","15163960"," No shit."
"15164420","15168460"," Facebook parent met his stock bounces after chart flashes most oversold reading in a decade."

"15171560","15172360"," Holy shit. "
"15173400","15175340"," Let's look at CFVI."
"15177200","15179180"," That whole thing was a scam, right?"
"15179400","15182020"," Was that like we're going to offer them $150 million?"
"15183240","15183880"," CFVI?"
"15184840","15188820"," Looks like somebody leaked it already with the Spotify trade."
"15193310","15195530"," Somebody already knew that the deal was done. "
"15196230","15198310"," Probably Jamie that bought those calls on Spotify."
"15205130","15206990"," Jamie put some calls on Spotify."
"15209610","15210830"," Yeah, of course, Joe. "
"15211090","15211590"," We'll do whatever you want."
"15214940","15216520"," That's a good CFVI, drilling."
"15218580","15219320"," The whole thing. "
"15219460","15222480"," We should have paid attention to that trade because we knew that was going to happen, right?"
"15223340","15225120"," I should have paid attention to that stupid trade."
"15225780","15226400"," That's a no-brainer."
"15232110","15233550"," Yeah, bye-bye CFVI. "
"15235070","15237130"," Looks like there's some support on $13."
"15239230","15240830"," Where's the, oh, there we go, baby."
"15241430","15243690"," CFVI, ultimately the price targets $10. "
"15244150","15248610"," There it is right there, $10 price targets CFVI."
"15250030","15251610"," Looks like there's plenty of time to get in."
"15254190","15256250"," Okay, we're going to look at IEX. "
"15263190","15267270"," All right, so we're going to look at IEX, and then I'm going to take a quick break until the"
"15267270","15268010"," two o'clock hour."
"15269530","15271250"," IEX and one other, DHR."
"15273970","15276870"," There's just PR to get the CFVI name out there. "
"15279030","15285030"," Yes, I do."

"15346570","15347730"," I know it's high."
"15348130","15352170"," It's like 15 grand a year or something. "
"15353250","15353610"," Minimum."
"15354090","15357050"," And then the hardware and the upgrades and all that kind of stuff."
"15357510","15360010"," This year probably will run me somewhere like 20 grand or something. "

"15394970","15396430"," Still watching that test."
"15397110","15400150"," A slow moving test on XLF."
"15401890","15402470"," Nice. "
"15402950","15403230"," IEX."
"15403810","15404130"," I like it."
"15406230","15408030"," More sellers than buyers right now. "
"15408510","15412610"," But I like the defined, you know, it's low volume, low float."
"15413490","15415090"," Not low float, probably just low volume."
"15416250","15416830"," Ticker. "
"15418670","15419650"," Buy a 190."
"15420330","15421050"," Sell it to 10."
"15421590","15423930"," I don't know how long you've been in this one for Joe. "
"15424910","15427270"," Looks like you've got major sellers though."
"15427610","15430650"," Just to head out heads up at a two-o-nine."
"15431690","15435330"," The only thing that's possible and can add GCI shares moving higher. "
"15435810","15436890"," They're called Shelley, India."
"15438170","15441370"," Then you buy the dip right now is one 90-77."
"15442910","15444350"," What was the other one that you wanted?"
"15444350","15448270"," I'm also mentioning Vroom VRM, possibly Victor Romeo-Michael. "
"15450270","15453270"," Yeah, there's some calls on shop earlier."
"15455630","15457310"," Yeah, DHR."
"15457950","15458970"," I got DHR. "
"15459730","15466560"," I got DHR."
"15469440","15477510"," Yeah, I like DHR."
"15477750","15478430"," Remember that ticker?"
"15482880","15484620"," This is your Chance Bears. "
"15485680","15489220"," You got to set the market on XLF."
"15495000","15496300"," Ooh, this one's nice too."
"15497560","15499160"," Get more sellers than buyers. "
"15502000","15503460"," Buy the dip is down at 269."
"15507500","15510820"," Apparently trading on a support level at 297."
"15513040","15515860"," Resistance at 305 and 312. "
"15515860","15519300"," I want to sell this here though."
"15519480","15521320"," More buyers than sellers where we are."
"15522260","15523040"," Let's see. "
"15523340","15523520"," Oop."
"15524300","15530980"," Okay, so your price target on VHRs 315."
"15532140","15537480"," That accepted 1.65 trillion dollars in the overnight first repo operation. "
"15538360","15539460"," Looks like 330."
"15540320","15541660"," You could probably make it to 330."
"15543680","15545020"," You need good news. "
"15547970","15549310"," Let's see it over here, right?"
"15552260","15555500"," I would say your price target's 315 on DHR."
"15557660","15561680"," Get slightly more sellers than buyers on this one, not the other ticker."
"15570910","15572610"," Yeah, just getting burned, right?"
"15572950","15575110"," Let me take a look and see what I got. "
"15576910","15578890"," I'm still like kicking around here."
"15579030","15588830"," I'm like down 30%, down 40%, down 30%, down 40%, down 30%,"
"15588830","15591870"," down 40%, down 40%, down 30%, down 30%, down 40%, down 40%."
"15591870","15593770"," The market's looking to break right in direction. "
"15596810","15602530"," I want to tell you this, I've got QQQ puts, right, but it's $60,000."
"15602530","15604490"," It's not really worth talking about."
"15604810","15611510"," Every 9th, 365th, not really worth talking about, because the next step I've got spy calls, every"
"15611510","15616770"," 9th, 454c, for $266,000. "
"15620740","15625160"," So I don't know what to say to you guys on the market moving right now, or the movement to"
"15625160","15625580"," the market."
"15628460","15636920"," This looks like, I mean, we've got more sellers than buyers, but this looks more like, we're moving"
"15636920","15637840"," up, not moving down."
"15642240","15643460"," I could be wrong on this, of course. "
"15644680","15645840"," Not financial advice."
"15661410","15664730"," Five harks, it's us back to 10.50, it goes."
"15668640","15671720"," Arcade doesn't show up well on a book map as well. "
"15672600","15673420"," I'm not going to show that one."
"15673600","15674300"," We've tried that one before."
"15677110","15678790"," I don't get my shit together with any donations. "
"15681170","15684090"," That's a prior SDIJ, same as C-Pump."
"15684350","15693500"," Nice call out, Josh, SDIG, ITRM."
"15694540","15696860"," Yeah, I'll look at an ITRM, nobody's called that one out before. "
"15698240","15698600"," ITRM."
"15706200","15707500"," I'll hold that one up for you."
"15709300","15713080"," Yeah, a lot of, I hear my hearing a lot of, oh, it's the supplier of yours. "
"15713080","15714000"," B-V-I-G."
"15715880","15718300"," I've heard a lot of whispers about B-V-I-G a lot of pumping."
"15720760","15722100"," H-I's in punch as well. "
"15723720","15724820"," Yeah, fuck me, Tom."
"15728140","15729020"," Yeah, see ya."
"15729260","15731260"," Yeah, film post, just dead today. "
"15732720","15735240"," Market is a moving bank selling to all the buyers, it seems."
"15735800","15738760"," I think what's funny too, is they made a trade against XLF at XLF."
"15738760","15740520"," XLF looks like it's fucking bottoming. "
"15740520","15747060"," It doesn't look like it's fucking, like loads of puts on XLF and it didn't go shit."
"15747260","15748800"," It just bounced right now, didn't it?"
"15748940","15750000"," A moment ago, I think it did."
"15751120","15752500"," That trade didn't work out. "
"15754140","15759900"," I guess maybe they just hold, still hold fast on their puts, and maybe they'll eventually print how"
"15759900","15762960"," to get out of market using the news, excuse the shit on bears or bulls or both."
"15763700","15769820"," You know, Thomas, someone brought up last night, late night to me, they said, that we're expecting"
"15769820","15773740"," a hot CPI print, that you might want to take the contrarian trade."
"15775970","15778430"," So, I mean, it's got to come in really, really hot. "
"15780270","15787010"," Now, the other side of that is that sometimes we'll dump it just cause, right?"
"15787390","15789410"," Even if the, let's say the print doesn't come in hot."
"15789610","15792690"," Remember when we had the employment numbers coming out really good?"
"15794030","15795970"," Right, and we dumped anyways, right?"
"15795970","15798650"," So, it didn't matter what the unemployment numbers are going to be."
"15799150","15803190"," They planned on us dumping, and so they didn't give a fine fuck what numbers we got. "
"15811870","15813350"," Yeah, look at pens for you too."
"15815990","15820830"," Yeah, XLF looks frozen, dude, seriously, like, what is going on with XLF?"
"15823510","15825330"," Vix is really close to going to sub 20."
"15829780","15831100"," Chaz is saying rush is undone. "
"15831360","15834780"," I would succeed in Russia crisis to talking about mint agreements."
"15838280","15839900"," Yeah, yeah, exactly."
"15840680","15843980"," You're really care we're trading against a month's CPI, or the February print is a throwaway"
"15843980","15846180"," because of how the BLS calculate the statistics yet. "
"15854370","15855490"," I thought we traded higher."
"15857050","15858310"," I thought there was this whole thing."
"15858510","15867100"," From my experience this time of year, my time, or my experience this time of year is once, once all"
"15867100","15876820"," the, once all big tech and shit, once they're all done with their ERs, they start announcing"
"15876820","15878300"," buybacks at any moment. "
"15879920","15883860"," If you start seeing companies just start, you start seeing, like, a bunch of big tech companies"
"15883860","15886360"," announcing buybacks right now, like Facebook's."
"15887820","15889540"," You're going to see rips all over the place."
"15889900","15893100"," You'll see them melt up from now into OPEC's. "
"15894900","15895660"," That's my fair."
"15895860","15899400"," You guys, if you guys want to see some good news that nobody doesn't know about, like something"
"15899400","15903360"," nobody is talking about, fucking start seeing buybacks happen."
"15906030","15911010"," The market's going to go straight north for like three, three, three days, five days. "
"15916300","15917020"," That's the news."
"15917340","15921740"," If anyone wants, if you want to know what the news is that we don't know about yet, it's if"
"15921740","15923100"," you start hearing about buybacks."
"15923760","15927240"," If that happens, that's the news. "
"15927560","15928240"," That's the good news."
"15929060","15931040"," S-O-X-X rocket ship right on."
"15935570","15938050"," Yeah, I'm looking at XLF right now. "
"15939290","15940710"," It's not looking that dumpy."
"15947720","15948940"," It's not looking that dumpy."
"15949960","15955300"," I don't know where we go. "
"15957060","15961220"," Usually in these moments, what happens is I get out of a trade and then it moves."
"15962060","15963200"," That's why I was going to take a break."
"15964040","15964920"," I was like, yeah, I'll take a break. "
"15965740","15966580"," Holy shit, really?"
"15966960","15967320"," ITRM."
"15968620","15969660"," You're going to be able to get ITRM."
"15973560","15976440"," So it's right at a resistance right now. "
"15979750","15980250"," 4492."
"15982250","15987830"," Buyers down below 0.3879. You got me with that one."
"15988270","15988690"," ITRM. "
"15989690","15999160"," Yeah, I thought that the blackouts on buybacks start ending this week."
"15999940","16002180"," If they did buybacks, it would have happened Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday."
"16003160","16004880"," The blackouts were in place still. "
"16008050","16011270"," I think everyone thought the buybacks happened last week, but they didn't."
"16015910","16017050"," Buybacks did not happen."
"16020010","16023670"," No, there's blackouts on the buybacks during their ERs. "
"16024410","16030310"," It returns."
"16031190","16031830"," What's Alex saying?"
"16033910","16039210"," OBV and RSI are both divergent and short-term head and shoulders straight."
"16039470","16040910"," It takes Agoflow as negative on the spy. "
"16043590","16046250"," Yeah, we've got a negative hero indicator here as well."
"16049720","16054260"," I am my one concern with the negativity on the heroin indicator today."
"16054260","16062240"," My only concern that I have on the heroin indicator today is the hedging activity might be"
"16062240","16063620"," influencing the heroin indicator. "
"16065120","16068420"," And I do think we enter volatility later on the day."
"16068960","16071920"," I think once again, like about 3 o'clock hour, we'll see some volatility to the close."
"16073540","16080380"," So it's 1.20. I think I said I would give the bulls till 2 p.m. So they got"
"16080380","16081020"," another half an hour. "
"16087300","16088320"," I've got two takes."
"16088580","16091640"," Two takes on the negative hero indicator being here all day long."
"16092240","16093660"," I've got two sides to this story. "
"16094260","16100020"," Number one, if the longer the hero indicator is negative, the more chance, if we're trading"
"16100020","16104200"," sideways like this, the greater the chance that we trade down eventually."
"16107710","16110130"," My only other concern with the hero is sometimes."
"16110130","16110570"," Inflation data. "
"16111490","16113690"," We'll show high year over year figure."
"16114370","16121270"," The white house saying that inflation data will show high year on year figure."
"16122110","16131060"," White House is trying to soften the blow on the CPI data tomorrow because I just heard that. "
"16132120","16133520"," But they've been talking about that for weeks."
"16134620","16139440"," The hero indicator should be negative at some point today on the spy."
"16139440","16140660"," If not tomorrow. "
"16141540","16145520"," The longer that stays negative, the more risk there is to the spy."
"16145800","16146900"," It's 1 p.m. Barnet."
"16147140","16154280"," It's a no lower taxes for working families and lower tariffs on many products. "
"16162360","16167960"," So eventually we should sell down from the hero indicator specifically on the spy due to it being"
"16167960","16168320"," negative."
"16170120","16171340"," So I do see that."
"16171560","16172660"," I do see that happening. "
"16173600","16176840"," My only concern with the hero indicator is every once in a while, it's not right."
"16178580","16181440"," That doesn't mean today that that is implied to today."
"16181840","16184960"," But I think that sometimes when people complain and say, oh, it's not working. "
"16185340","16187540"," Why were we going up when the hero indicator was down?"
"16188440","16189380"," Why didn't it work out?"
"16189480","16193920"," I think it's sometimes because it's accounting for hedging activity and not put flow."
"16197550","16200710"," Which is two different things, believe it or not."
"16206170","16208170"," So I'll get to the bulls until three o'clock. "
"16208470","16214030"," If nothing changes, then I will close my position and I'll be looking to take a new answer."
"16214390","16219690"," Outside of forecasters, projections continue to show moderate fall and inflation going forward."
"16221290","16222330"," That's a cracker shit. "
"16233800","16234660"," Say we dump."
"16258720","16260140"," Yeah, here he got here, Chaz."
"16260660","16261740"," We beat you, Chaz. "
"16265040","16266660"," We're ahead of everything you post, Chaz."
"16266820","16267380"," We've already got it."
"16273890","16277010"," Yeah, that's what the one, that's what one guy was saying last night. "
"16277170","16278770"," It's a smart trader too long time."
"16280930","16281790"," Big money trader."
"16282150","16285510"," He's like, he's like the worst they make it, man. "
"16285510","16287990"," He's like, oh, we get to the CPI report."
"16288730","16290170"," It's going to be old news."
"16290530","16292510"," And I was like, I wasn't thinking of it like that. "
"16293750","16298650"," I was looking at it as a highly volatile event and we probably trade down from it."
"16304920","16306780"," Yeah, so I'm going to give it to the bulls until two."
"16307140","16308600"," I'm going to give it to the bulls until two. "
"16308720","16312160"," We could possibly head into like three o'clock hour where I think it'll get riskier the closer we"
"16312160","16318040"," get to three p.m. My and the volatility I'm looking at for the close has more to do with"
"16318040","16323300"," some of the bigger tickers that we have having earnings."
"16324620","16326600"," I don't like those tickers ever."
"16326760","16331200"," I don't like trading them typically either around their openers and closes every day like Disney. "
"16331620","16333040"," It's a disaster to trade."
"16335380","16345260"," I'm going to trade Disney like burn off into the bell and then rip higher by 10, 20 points."
"16347000","16349160"," And then sell off right at the opening bell the following day. "
"16352490","16353370"," Yeah, I can check crowd for you."
"16360300","16361800"," I'm going to check what for you crowd."
"16367370","16370650"," And I think someone else is on the opposite side of my trade right now. "
"16371690","16374130"," I figured who it is up there that's in my hold on."
"16375270","16379450"," Someone's on the opposite side of my trade and their puts aren't doing as good either."
"16379970","16384340"," I figured who it is that's in the put side. "
"16385259","16386900"," Just burn it off both sides right now."
"16402860","16403580"," I'm going to take a break."
"16403800","16404380"," I'll be back in a bit. "
"16405960","16407200"," Come back for the show with two."
"16408040","16408740"," We'll have a show."
"16408860","16409460"," I guarantee it. "
"16412910","16417730"," The only other concern I'd bring on brings you on this would be that if you're bearish right now at"
"16417730","16418910"," this moment for just for today."
"16420090","16422830"," This is the place right make a stand right here without a doubt."
"16422950","16423970"," This is the place to take a stand. "
"16427180","16428740"," But the banks brought us up here for a reason."
"16429360","16432800"," That's the implied idea is that we're here for a reason."
"16433660","16438240"," Although we know the real reason is that the value of put hedging is burning off right now. "
"16438900","16440259"," Maybe that's some capitulation."
"16441180","16442060"," People on hedging."
"16449119","16450160"," Crowd, I like crowd. "
"16450840","16451560"," I like it."
"16451860","16454800"," There's more sellers than buyers right now in crowd, but I do like positioning."
"16456020","16457439"," You know, 150 to 180. "
"16457860","16458640"," The price target's 225."
"16460220","16461060"," I do like crowd though."
"16461220","16461580"," I like this setup. "
"16461580","16468099"," I don't really ever like when like the balls here down below and these are like, you know, all of"
"16468099","16468880"," you get no supports."
"16469619","16471380"," Crowd's got really nice supports right now."
"16471700","16472119"," I like it. "
"16479779","16480380"," All right."
"16480520","16481200"," I'll be back in just a minute."
"16481300","16481759"," Take a quick break. "
"16791590","16799130"," This heads up that I'm watching a lot of tickers from yesterday's ER rolling over."
"16802010","16804730"," Like 10 phase is rolling over."
"16806570","16809590"," Slightly starting to get kind of weird looking. "
"16816710","16819070"," Like while looking at chewy real quick."

"16912180","16914400"," They seem to be slightly rolling over."
"16914400","16918160"," It could be a false bull flag."

"18364920","18370560"," I think I'm at $0.11. I think I started at like $0.15. About a bunch of like $0 "
"18370560","18375620",".05, $0.06. I don't know exactly where I'm at, but somewhere in there."
"18385770","18388810"," Yeah, right in here there's a little bit of ice back up in here."
"18389070","18393390"," If we break above this 4574, there should be clear skies to 460. "
"18394330","18396030"," If not, we'll see if we get a sell off."
"18399590","18409700"," The real target, I think, is the 45754, that's"
"18409700","18411200"," where it's the prior high, right?"
"18411200","18421040"," I know that ASG mentioned 460 is being the target, but the 45754 is that previous"
"18421040","18421480"," high."
"18422640","18423700"," Let's see if we can get that high. "
"18423780","18424920"," I'll see if I'm breaking even or not."
"18434410","18436410"," Yeah, somewhere between now and 3PM, we'll know."
"18437110","18437890"," We've had a lot of..."
"18437890","18439770"," It's been where we had a lot of moving going on, right?"
"18439930","18440410"," At 2 o'clock?"
"18444720","18446900"," It used to be like 3PM every day. "
"18446900","18454700"," We'd see the market kind of slow down at 2PM and then we'd see a move at 3, but it"
"18454700","18458120"," seems like lately 2PM has been power hours."
"18470640","18475080"," There's a lot of squeezing going on because the hedge on Facebook is on a 220."
"18476260","18478880"," That's the talk elsewhere. "
"18492230","18492850"," That's right."
"18511600","18518420"," Much of some calls come in on MSFT, February 11th, $100,000."
"18519220","18527220"," CVS calls coming in for any of you that are interested in CVS, February 11th, 106 per $30,000. "
"18535970","18537470"," 45, 7, 12."
"18543970","18549590"," Wiki's like spies only going up until Captain Jim James sells his fucking calls."
"18551490","18552630"," Then it'll go down. "
"18569090","18571210"," I know, I know, I agree, Wiki."
"18576490","18584970"," Now trading up to 45, 7.23. I'm going to break through this area here."
"18585130","18588970"," If we can break through this area here, a little bit more ice above 4520. "
"18591970","18593350"," That's an interesting number."
"18594130","18594630"," I think there's ice."
"18594810","18596290"," I think there's more ice here than showing. "
"18597070","18599710"," I think there's more sellers here that are showing themselves."
"18612540","18615700"," They don't understand that, Wiki, that the Facebook glue is temporary."
"18631570","18634030"," It's hard covering slightly different than a van or alley. "
"18644480","18657840"," The equity market's extending gains to the SPF 1.4%. Now let's back up almost 1.9%. It's"
"18657840","18659000"," like 10 cents right now."
"18659320","18661080"," So I'm getting close to break even here."
"18667010","18669590"," It shows 455 puts everybody's in. "
"18669830","18671170"," Those things are just getting hammered."
"18671390","18672690"," They're down to like 26 cents."
"18675770","18679290"," They're at like 45 or 48 cents, right?"
"18679510","18680110"," Not too long ago. "
"18680550","18687120"," I think this morning they were at fucking like two bucks or something."
"18688760","18693040"," They'd go back and look and see what exactly was bottled a long on spy puts."
"18693940","18695080"," Shit tons of spy puts. "
"18696640","18725680"," You should"
"18725680","18727840"," see some action here within the next five minutes."
"18733460","18742220"," Now I'm actually looking at the spot cam information on Facebook right now."
"18742400","18745720"," I've been looking at it for the past half an hour or so when I was taking that break, whatever"
"18745720","18746440"," it was, 10 minutes. "
"18747380","18753140"," I was looking at some tools that I could look at for individual tickers."
"18755900","18757680"," It's got one of the biggest hedges on it."
"18761420","18763020"," More so than any other ticker. "
"18763540","18767220"," I think that's why you're not seeing the Tesla squeeze."
"18767640","18769520"," That small little squeeze on Tesla is not as big."
"18770980","18772820"," Because the hedge wall is not that low. "
"18773880","18775580"," But it's hello low on Facebook."
"18802540","18807200"," You'll notice that the Facebook squeeze won't like the it won't last as long."
"18808080","18809500"," It was a true Vanna squeeze. "
"18809760","18811100"," It would just be straight up melt up."
"18811100","18813280"," You see small melt or small squeezes."
"18813720","18815160"," That's just that short covering. "
"18819550","18822270"," The next three minutes or so we'll see some movement."
"18838240","18839720"," I like that winky."
"18841080","18841960"," Who's SNX?"
"18842340","18843880"," I think we haven't talked about SNX before. "
"18849840","18851620"," The XPI was a nice play this week, wasn't it?"
"18854420","18855700"," XPI was a beautiful play."
"18862730","18864430"," I'm going to look at that one up for myself."
"18866630","18867770"," What am I looking for here?"
"18868610","18870850"," I thought we discussed SNX before. "
"18879970","18881430"," Yeah, I like that SNX, bro."
"18888360","18889920"," I like how it's trading, bro."
"18890260","18891760"," I like the whole chart on it. "
"18896620","18897780"," I'm going to have to buy some of that."
"18900540","18901440"," Buy some stink."
"18902900","18903680"," Is that way today?"
"18904460","18906900"," Is that a cool offer a day or just buy?"
"18945220","18947740"," I've got bulls trying to buy calls right now. "
"18949120","18953780"," The February 9th, 455C, $246,000."
"18955540","18960760"," Spy calls again, February 9th, 458C, $36,000."
"18961920","18963120"," Come to me, bulls. "
"18963400","18964100"," I'll hand you my bags."
"18967960","18969560"," Come find me."
"18974400","18975560"," I've always got to love it. "
"18998700","19000940"," Yeah, I was wonder if I should wait down the ride."
"19001080","19002860"," I saw that 104, 105 number."
"19006190","19006990"," First we can march. "
"19007590","19008570"," Yeah, I like that trade."
"19011630","19012790"," We're like SNX."
"19022440","19023340"," All right, 215. "
"19023840","19024420"," Let's see what happens."
"19048220","19054460"," Yeah, cues are the key gamma strike right now at NASDAQ."
"19060400","19061660"," So just heads up. "
"19061860","19063800"," Saw you guys are all your weirdos out there."
"19063900","19067340"," We are at 15,024 on NASDAQ."
"19070980","19072560"," Cool, 15,000. "
"19077220","19077740"," Notable."
"19079240","19088840"," Also, if you're looking at a daily chart on the NASDAQ on the SMA, the 200, we're just coming into"
"19088840","19092840"," the 200 right now on 200."
"19092840","19095680"," 200, uh, simple move to daily moving average daily. "
"19095920","19097300"," There's simple moving average SMA."
"19097460","19099060"," We're going to call it DMA."
"19101040","19104440"," We are right at resistance on the 200 MA. "
"19104660","19108200"," This would be a turning point for the bulls if we're able to get above it."
"19108740","19110800"," It's a critical moment in juncture."
"19111620","19114840"," So grab your champagne, your bourbon, your cigars. "
"19115540","19121940"," If you're a bear, you know, you're watching the 21 day moving averages swooping underneath."
"19125240","19126640"," NASDAQ right now."
"19129780","19134540"," We should see a pretty decent blast off or a rejection here. "
"19147160","19166350"," So here"
"19166350","19172030"," we are basically in the area just at a larger or a larger view here, right?"
"19172030","19180430"," Markets are starting to look at, you know, that 460 mark at 457.42. Almost 458."
"19180910","19182630"," This is the inflection point, right?"
"19183430","19184610"," It's all the way down to 420."
"19187610","19188990"," We're right here right now. "
"19191410","19193150"," This is where the market looks up and around."
"19193530","19194150"," Hey, this is where we're headed."
"19195170","19198710"," This is next stop 480 or as far as we're going. "
"19213750","19229630"," If you look on a, if you bring up a chart on NDX, the NASDAQ, 100, put it"
"19229630","19230470"," on a daily chart."
"19234110","19240110"," You'll see the 21 MA swooping underneath the green candle for today."
"19240430","19242910"," And then it's about tap here, the 200 MA. "
"19244990","19247030"," 200 day moving average."
"19252260","19256800"," You're either going to see a rocket ship north, like a fucking rocket ship."
"19258220","19259780"," Or you're going to see a big rejection. "
"19266740","19269660"," Spy March 18th, 476 C."
"19278880","19281880"," This is where all the pain comes in if you're a bear, right?"
"19282080","19283380"," You're just like, ah, I'm in pain."
"19286060","19288800"," The question becomes, is there bear capitulation?"
"19289540","19292860"," Or do bears double down, triple down, quadruple down?"
"19294160","19295560"," Pretty big moment in the market."
"19296620","19297440"," Very noteworthy. "
"19305320","19307460"," Yeah, I got a, what do I have here?"
"19308520","19312240"," March 18th, 476 C."
"19314520","19314820"," Spy, right?"
"19314820","19319680"," Spy March 18th, 476 C, $927,000."
"19321320","19323140"," We are seeing call expansion."
"19324020","19327460"," That will lend itself, if we have that call expansion too, right?"
"19328020","19334740"," That lends us to more, a larger trading range. "
"19342040","19343440"," That kills some volatility."
"19344640","19346040"," But it also, we can trade higher."
"19366180","19367180"," What did I miss, Winky?"
"19368360","19372120"," I missed something. "
"19373640","19374820"," In the chat, I missed something."
"19375320","19376720"," I said, I'll keep saying it."
"19381570","19385070"," Now, another way to look at this too would be if you're a bull and you want to go along. "
"19385290","19386610"," This is a nice place to put a hedge on."
"19395640","19396860"," Not a bad place to hedge."
"19410160","19411340"," Just a heads up. "
"19411580","19417160"," We just flipped gamma positive on SPX technically, supposedly."
"19417560","19419820"," I don't know if I can verify that."
"19427290","19428930"," Yeah, Tom, that's a fair point too. "
"19431010","19432570"," We just flipped the positive gamma."
"19433590","19434890"," Just a heads up on that note."
"19435430","19440170"," We are at a very critical or key moment in the market right now. "
"19458230","19461970"," Are you guys, is there a lot of lag in my video right now?"
"19461970","19464230"," I've got 2.23 in the afternoon."
"19464510","19471010"," Are you guys getting me at a, was there much lag in this video?"
"19474310","19477610"," You will, one other note on this too, on this subject."
"19477970","19482390"," Now, sometimes you'll see VIX going with the market going up too. "
"19482390","19486190"," So that could happen if we trade higher here."
"19487850","19490290"," And say we are going to trade higher, I'm saying if we do."
"19491050","19495310"," You could see the VIX actually go up as we trade higher just due to where we are in the"
"19495310","19495590"," market. "
"19500780","19502860"," You got that Python script to run right on."
"19504300","19515700"," A little"
"19515700","19516400"," lag, okay good."
"19519840","19520400"," I got you, Jess. "
"19526190","19527510"," 20 second delay is not so bad."
"19528430","19529730"," That's pretty fast actually."
"19532010","19540790"," I posted a Python script yesterday for the free script that's for"
"19542940","19552180"," gamma and GEX and volatility levels"
"19552180","19554280"," that you can get up to date current. "
"19555280","19558060"," So you're not just relying on, on Spock gamma."
"19558300","19564820"," You actually can get to the, to the minute, to the hour posted on the regular handle last night."
"19565140","19567740"," I should have posted in the, in the fucking discord and I didn't. "
"19568340","19569560"," It was late last night."
"19575450","19581690"," Now what you guys want to, what you guys want to know is that we're flipping the positive gamma"
"19581690","19582170"," right now."
"19582190","19586050"," Now that doesn't really hold it, but this is an inflection point in the market right here, okay. "
"19589590","19590250"," We're in on bill."
"19590390","19590530"," Yes."
"19591650","19594430"," So right here where we are in the market right now is, is crucial. "
"19596830","19597930"," It's crucial that it holds."
"19598310","19600510"," You want to see, but there's things you want to see, right?"
"19601130","19602990"," You want to see call expansion."
"19603490","19605650"," I mean, if you're a bull, this is what I want to tell you what you guys want to see. "
"19605870","19605990"," Okay."
"19607310","19610550"," This is like a painful moment for being a bear, right?"
"19611110","19613670"," This is when bears that have been short."
"19615090","19619810"," This is a point of, you know, like investor trader psychology, all that kind of stuff. "
"19621530","19624850"," Then you've got the banks, of course, are aware of this where we are right now."
"19625470","19629550"," So you're going to be looking for call expansion, not in the money stuff."
"19630170","19633950"," Because if it's in the money stuff, then we're just going to trade like we are right now, right?"
"19634150","19635130"," Day to day, day to day. "
"19635470","19637310"," That's also why the VIX is up at 20."
"19639670","19645930"," If you see a start, let's say you start seeing lots of calls coming in a month, three months away"
"19645930","19647490"," outside the money."
"19648750","19653630"," And you start to see no, you start to see bears and even bulls not taking on protection, right?"
"19654230","19655550"," They're not as fair for anymore. "
"19655970","19657370"," They're not renewing the protection."
"19659350","19665890"," Then you'll see volatility compress, which would lead to higher prices slowly over time if we"
"19665890","19666530"," expand the calls."
"19668650","19670290"," That doesn't mean you trade up to 480. "
"19670670","19672710"," But if you've got 480 calls, you're probably trade up to 470."
"19676140","19678500"," You'll have some better range expansion too, right?"
"19678660","19683300"," Right now it's been brutal trading in the direction of bias."
"19683520","19687300"," You can't take with, you know, the VIX over 2023, you can't take a swing trade. "
"19687940","19689020"," I'm sorry, you just can't."
"19689860","19691460"," It's almost impossible to do."
"19691460","19694300"," Oh, just what?"
"19694440","19694540"," Yeah. "
"19694780","19696540"," So you want to see this 30 things you're looking for."
"19696620","19702540"," So if you're a bear right now at this inflection point, you're looking for a renewal of puts,"
"19702980","19703140"," right?"
"19703340","19705760"," You want to see bears step in here and say, fuck that."
"19705840","19706520"," We ain't doing this. "
"19707440","19710880"," And I'm going to load the tits on a bunch of puts, right?"
"19711000","19712300"," And just overload the market with puts."
"19714660","19721040"," The other thing that you're looking for is are the banks buying actual underlying equities, which"
"19721040","19722400"," they did yesterday into the close."
"19722880","19724420"," And it looks like they're doing here today, right?"
"19726980","19730080"," And then Winky's talking about taking profit. "
"19730700","19734600"," So what Winky's point is, is that a bank, let's say, bought calls down at 420."
"19735440","19737780"," And they want to take profit now, right?"
"19737960","19739420"," They're going to handbags off to you."
"19740100","19743700"," You're going to buy those calls from him or the, or the dealers will buy him back. "
"19755350","19758010"," Y'all posted on the ad captain's alpha today."
"19764760","19765580"," That's a joke, right?"
"19765580","19768880"," I just made bank on the ride down from 480 to 420."
"19770840","19775940"," You could probably buy your house with the money I made on the ride down. "
"19776440","19777280"," It was awesome."
"19777860","19782760"," And then on the ride up, I paid for more put protection for a free ride up."
"19787960","19789460"," So you just want to be looking here. "
"19790100","19794840"," You want to be looking, you want to just be aware as we trade the next day or two where"
"19794840","19795180"," we are."
"19795660","19805380"," I'm going to be aware today, tomorrow, the flows that come in, you want to be hyper aware"
"19806480","19808600"," of an expansion in call buying."
"19808800","19812180"," If you don't see an expansion in call buying, we know what happens. "
"19817350","19818810"," We'll drift lower until we do."
"19837420","19839460"," This is going to get rid of the fuck I'm exactly."
"19847240","19849180"," This hasn't been a fueled rally either. "
"19849400","19850180"," Let's be clear about something."
"19850180","19851520"," This isn't a van a rally."
"19851680","19855060"," I don't know how much experience you guys have had with van a rallies and short covering rallies. "
"19855540","19857440"," This is a short covering rally so far."
"19859520","19861880"," There are unique differences to both."
"19868670","19870150"," Yeah, I normally don't. "
"19870170","19875610"," Someone just asked if I watch the discord feed during stream and I don't, but I'm going to start"
"19875610","19876570"," watching it now."
"19876930","19878190"," I use this VU-ZI."
"19878370","19882070"," They're expanding its logistics operations in Europe to support growing European businesses. "
"19884050","19889310"," I'm going to start paying attention to it."
"19889870","19891670"," I have it on right now in a different computer."
"19892010","19893310"," I do have it in front of me right now. "
"19893570","19898370"," It's been hard for me to get into the gist of doing this live streaming and then adding each tool"
"19898370","19901870"," and paying attention to everything all at once while I'm trading as well."
"19902390","19902830"," It's been complicated."
"19903630","19904890"," It's just memory. "
"19905950","19908530"," Having to do things over and over and over and over and over again."
"19911060","19912240"," Heaven flow just heard me."
"19914420","19915920"," He just so tweaked. "
"19916160","19917160"," I wrote something and discord."
"19919320","19925020"," Do you just have to be aware of what this means where we are?"
"19925080","19928040"," I want you guys all the guys out there to understand where we are in the market."
"19928860","19930720"," Have a broader view of where we are in the market. "
"19932460","19936840"," And what signs you're looking for if you're bullish for us to continue to trade higher."
"19937720","19939020"," You could trade sideways too."
"19939020","19942060"," I think someone posts that in the chat. "
"19942800","19944340"," If we don't see call expansion."
"19947300","19948300"," So look at this."
"19948480","19950540"," We can we can make it really we can dumb it down. "
"19951220","19955740"," So if I'm a dealer there's other there's other parts concepts in this but we can dumb it down real"
"19955740","19956080"," simple."
"19956500","19961360"," So let's say I'm a guy right and you're betting the market goes down."
"19962240","19966320"," In three months and so you hand me a hundred bucks and you say okay captain. "
"19966820","19969060"," I'm betting you that the market goes down in three months."
"19969060","19970900"," Here's a hundred bucks right."
"19971720","19972900"," You give me a hundred bucks. "
"19973700","19974720"," For me it's real simple."
"19975140","19976680"," As simple as possible."
"19977240","19980320"," So you give me a hundred bucks right and you say in three months the market's going down. "
"19980460","19982240"," So I take your hundred bucks right."
"19984700","19990680"," And then I'm looking for some some counter party to say well I don't agree with that."
"19991020","19991740"," I don't agree with Winky. "
"19992380","19993400"," I think the market's going up."
"19993780","19994900"," I'm like okay give me a hundred bucks."
"19994900","19998740"," So this other guy will call him Jess because Jess is uber bullish. "
"19999560","20002520"," So Jess gives me a hundred bucks saying the market's going up right."
"20006060","20008620"," Winky gives me a hundred bucks saying the market's going down right."
"20009400","20013240"," So first thing I'm going to do is when Winky gives a hundred bucks I'm going to hedge against that"
"20013240","20014360"," actually coming true right. "
"20015120","20019100"," And then I'm going to hedge against Jess when Jess steps up and says no we're going up."
"20019220","20020540"," So I'm hedging both sides right now."
"20020880","20022160"," We don't really have any more movement. "
"20023780","20025320"," The market wouldn't move there."
"20026700","20031680"," So what I need to see is as time passes the market would go sideways right."
"20031960","20037720"," And I would murder both Josh or Jess and Winky's puts and calls. "
"20037800","20040140"," And I would keep the hundred dollars believe it or not."
"20040820","20041620"," Thank you for playing."
"20041840","20044260"," That's where that thing comes from basically right. "
"20044500","20044960"," Thank you for playing."
"20045140","20045680"," I took your money."
"20046260","20046900"," Nobody won. "
"20048000","20048560"," The house wins."
"20051190","20052010"," It's really basic."
"20052270","20053750"," There's a hole that gets way more complicated. "
"20053750","20055510"," But hold on a second."
"20058920","20064440"," So let's say now Winky and Jess have calls and puts equal value on the market."
"20065980","20069720"," And then some other guy like Joe Donut shows up. "
"20069960","20073600"," This could feature settling eighty nine spots sixty six for barrel up."
"20074180","20075700"," About three tenths of one percent."
"20076640","20079420"," Joe Donut shows up he says you know what I'm with Winky we're going down. "
"20079700","20081820"," So they put two hundred bucks in there."
"20083120","20085760"," All right now they got two hundred bucks a hundred bucks hundred bucks each right."
"20094240","20096080"," Yes the gamma post from Surji. "
"20099240","20100000"," Thanks Winky."
"20109820","20111080"," I appreciate that Winky."
"20119340","20121160"," And so some weird things can have it right. "
"20121320","20121640"," Let's say."
"20123200","20127840"," So I've got I've got Joe and Winky head straight and I got another hundred bucks from somebody else"
"20127840","20129840"," where markets going down markets going down."
"20130420","20135920"," I need like a like a cascading effect for the market to go down right for puts to go down. "
"20136080","20141300"," I need people to keep buying puts so that I can pay Winky and then Joe."
"20141960","20144080"," And then we get all this fervor down here right."
"20144900","20148500"," And sooner than later I've got a bunch of people buying a whole bunch puts down here. "
"20148860","20150380"," Meanwhile Jess's money is gone."
"20151160","20155180"," We've taken who've taken Jess's money and paid Winky off paid Joe off."
"20155180","20157840"," And then we got a bunch of FOMO at the bottom. "
"20158480","20160840"," Then you get a bunch of bears buying puts right."
"20161520","20164140"," A bunch of bears at the bottom markets already gone down."
"20166100","20168880"," Now they're buying all these expensive puts down here right. "
"20169060","20170400"," They're now worth a thousand bucks."
"20171120","20174420"," They paid me a thousand bucks for the puts that were originally a hundred dollars."
"20176260","20180800"," And then all of a sudden a bunch of bear bull step in and they're like ooh calls are super"
"20180800","20182140"," cheap so they start buying them. "
"20183700","20185520"," Oh ma'am come complicating this."
"20185560","20186300"," They didn't make this simpler."
"20189690","20194770"," My stance is that FBO pecs is 450 then 441 then Marshall pecs and spies 471. "
"20199440","20201660"," I don't care if I don't care if you're wrong or right."
"20203160","20203960"," Hello one second."
"20206810","20216650"," So I get some spy puts coming in right now spy 29456 P and then spy puts 216 448"
"20216650","20218550"," P for $92,000. "
"20220930","20222230"," I think we get opecs."
"20222350","20225630"," My opecs numbers right around 440, 442 of February."
"20227770","20228870"," I think we trade lower. "
"20229870","20232110"," I think the high level for us is 480."
"20233270","20235610"," I think I don't think we get any higher than 480."
"20236110","20241630"," So I think the wall like the absolute gamma strike on the spy is 480. "
"20242550","20245210"," Maybe we trade so 460 is pretty high for us."
"20245210","20249890"," We could possibly trade to 470 or wish we could trade to 480."
"20251070","20252470"," And then I think we trade down. "
"20255300","20256100"," That's what I think."
"20261740","20264220"," Anyways the point being is this so where we are right now."
"20264740","20265940"," I'm fucking this up. "
"20266760","20271520"," The point being is this where we are right now you want to see bears lay in on puts like"
"20271520","20273360"," lay in right."
"20276350","20279850"," The only way that those puts down there are going to print as if that happens."
"20281850","20287630"," And calls were so goddamn cheap at 420 right that people bought calls dirt cheap. "
"20288170","20289610"," And so we're running it up right now."
"20289850","20292370"," And now people are taking profit on these on these calls."
"20292570","20292970"," That's a winky. "
"20293090","20293990"," I think it's talking about."
"20295630","20298530"," As they're going to hand those off the bag holders right there."
"20298590","20301870"," Now you got a bullet pair that's going to be like, Hey, yeah, we're going to fucking 480. "
"20303070","20304570"," Give me some of those expensive calls."
"20308290","20309890"," All saying 450 by end of week."
"20313390","20316630"," That's a fair that's a fair that's a fair point to winky. "
"20317150","20318990"," But they won't take it there until after they expire."
"20321750","20324790"," Yeah, I've got a link down below to think about it."
"20324910","20325990"," Do I have a wee boo link down there?"
"20326630","20328390"," Just sign up for like we will or something like that. "
"20339900","20343040"," I think most I think most platforms have paper trading."
"20343420","20346120"," Not all I don't think I don't know if I don't know if Robinhood does."
"20346120","20349120"," I don't know if options AI does. "
"20370080","20372960"," I've only had nine cents on those calls."
"20390850","20396310"," All those puts are down to 17, 18 cents on those where all those."
"20396430","20398370"," Those bunch people are in on. "
"20399370","20402330"," Or algos are in on 265 P."
"20403170","20404830"," No, sorry, 455 P."
"20405670","20411700"," They're down to 18 cents now for February 9th expiring."
"20411700","20422040"," I might be"
"20422040","20424200"," interested in buying some puts at some point."
"20426080","20429200"," Maybe a 3 p.m. I'm interested in trading puts. "
"20432540","20433380"," Being tempted."
"20440070","20441010"," Penn's finally moving."
"20453220","20456260"," I'm going to have to cut these fucking calls loose if I don't make any money. "
"20459500","20460900"," Because I'm going to fucking burn them."
"20461060","20461720"," I guarantee it."
"20473430","20476690"," Watching some calls on uber dangerous trade. "
"20477610","20479070"," February 11th, 41 C."
"20480950","20482390"," $169,000."
"20485490","20489030"," Spy calls to 11 462 C."
"20491270","20493150"," That's against what I'm saying, of course."
"20507840","20510840"," We'll see if we can melt up into the bell and then melt up into. "
"20511140","20512420"," We melt up into the bell to 460."
"20513300","20514140"," That'd be kind of nice."
"20515140","20519880"," If not, we could trade higher after the bell in the overnight. "
"20527460","20528940"," Bears are failing it right now."
"20529060","20529320"," They're sweating."
"20531060","20536720"," I still have put spreads for 40s and for 42s. "
"20540200","20545160"," But they were free."
"20546680","20548040"," I think cost me shit though."
"20548840","20550620"," I'm still fucking diving in those things. "
"20562960","20564300"," We'll see if we roll over here."
"20564380","20569180"," We've got 20 minutes until 3 p.m. Not as much moving as I was expecting at 2 o'clock."
"20569380","20571180"," At 2 o'clock I was expecting some big moves. "
"20571800","20573400"," We haven't gotten it on either side."
"20579770","20583050"," The hedge wall on Facebook was down at..."
"20583050","20584330"," Let me look and see."
"20585170","20587950"," Hedge wall this morning on..."
"20589810","20591110"," Let me take a look real quick. "
"20602150","20603330"," I think it was at 220."
"20607380","20610860"," The hedge wall was at 220 this morning on Facebook."
"20611360","20612540"," The key gamma strike was 220. "
"20613420","20614120"," Trade net, 228."
"20616640","20625120"," I use the pro chart spot gamma hedge or squeeze tool that they have to find these."
"20637990","20640610"," We have a lot of puts rolling off today as well, right?"
"20640790","20645870"," The more puts that we have rolling off the market, the more we don't re-head or buy more puts"
"20646610","20648670"," than you will see us trade high. "
"20648850","20650130"," We'll just keep melting up."
"20651310","20657510"," The melt-up will be if there's no more hedging or put buying."
"20658370","20664670"," The VANA rally would be that the puts roll off and don't get re-hedged and call expansion. "
"20665050","20666450"," That's when you see a true VANA rally."
"20667510","20668470"," There's a difference."
"20668730","20675490"," You should be aware of the differences between a melt-up from puts losing value and being closed. "
"20678130","20682270"," The VANA rally, which is where we just go straight bars, green straight up for three straight days."
"20685210","20690410"," Even my calls right now, the calls that I'm in right now, are not gaining value like they would in"
"20690410","20692990"," a VANA rally, which would be the dual effect."
"20693390","20701110"," You'd get the dual effect of puts rolling off and being closed and sold and all kinds of other"
"20701110","20701330"," shit. "
"20704530","20710950"," I tend to kind of suppose for us to say we still don't know if Putin has made the decision"
"20710950","20711590"," on Ukraine."
"20714080","20718420"," They want to see both of those actions at the same time, which we haven't seen yet still on the"
"20718420","20718720"," market."
"20719000","20720700"," It's just this slow grind up. "
"20729970","20732190"," There has been some rolling of puts."
"20732770","20738570"," There was some rolling of puts to the March 18th strike."
"20738570","20745190"," They rolled from February 18th to March 18th down to like, I think it was 4.30, 4.24.30."
"20745770","20753070"," Then this week there was some more roll into May for 400. "
"20755150","20756670"," Much lower in May."
"20760320","20764720"," Then I saw some IWM puts that came out yesterday, some wonky hedging that came out on IWM."
"20767910","20770710"," Watching some spy puts low money like 30 grand. "
"20771290","20780070"," Cues low money on calls like spy February 9th, 457 P for $36,000."
"20780430","20785450"," Then queues February 9th, 367 C for $39,000."
"20790080","20791740"," I want to see what Uber does. "
"20799410","20801850"," I guess maybe the trade would just be some call spreads."
"20802730","20805170"," If you were bullish, just get some call spreads at the open."
"20826240","20826720"," Yeah. "
"20829530","20831110"," I've had another day in another country."
"20841820","20843760"," 4.43 around March 1st."
"20850270","20856070"," Yeah, I always get pissed off when they do that winky when they burn the strikes and then the week"
"20856070","20857150"," or two later they nail it. "
"20865260","20870580"," So right now we're at a, we're flipping balltail or flipping gamma right now."
"20877820","20879120"," It does account for the hedging."
"20881200","20884000"," Thanks for getting it wasn't sure if it did or didn't. "
"20886260","20887140"," Because that would."
"20897610","20902190"," So is the indicator separate for hedging or is it not a part of the hero?"
"20905900","20907720"," I know it is always their job, isn't it?"
"20909120","20910320"," Thank you for playing."
"20913940","20918760"," That's why when I take the goldins, I usually put more time on them more in the money. "
"20921870","20924310"," I usually put like one one strike later."
"20926450","20927610"," Where all the money is."
"20930850","20931950"," For the same reason. "
"20932710","20939700"," A little bit of rolling over here at 247."
"20984630","20993720"," Yeah, if you get a VIX lower than 20, if you get a VIX lower than 20, yeah, that's what"
"20993720","20997080"," I do with the, that's what I do."
"21003500","21013340"," I usually get them farther out in the money, but sometimes in spreads they buy them. "
"21015000","21019300"," And I've only gotten really fucked on, the only time I've ever gotten fucked on goldins is"
"21019300","21025960"," typically on a stock that relies upon news to move like airline, like any, like any of the stocks"
"21025960","21030460"," that are prone to shitty news, they never seem to work out for me."
"21032500","21033240"," Like BA."
"21036840","21039700"," Like news driven tickers, I hate goldins on those. "
"21042880","21044640"," I've got a VIX here at 207."

"23839760","23840500"," Well, I don't tell anybody."
"23840880","23844540"," But the game is to take all of our money away that we made in the last couple of years."
"23845140","23846160"," We're just unwilling to give it up. "
"23851320","23852900"," That was a baller trade, by the way."
"23852900","23855620"," Any of you that grew away will grab those calls."
"23856620","23857620"," A baller trade. "

"24041200","24045040"," In Vasqua is that everybody knows that we're getting a shitty CPI. "
"24045760","24048020"," I guess the question is does it?"
"24049240","24052580"," Does it mean we don't dump because everybody knows?"
"24053600","24054820"," What's your thoughts on that in Vasqua?"
"24072760","24081450"," We haven't talked about PTON as at all today."
"24086780","24088440"," A nice little swan dive."

"24156850","24159050"," You guys all play, you're funny, huh?"
"24160970","24167570"," It's okay though because those 460c's are still up to $1.45. They've been lost in either value."
"24168470","24173430"," None of you guys should be upside down in that trade, even with that sell-off."
"24175780","24178140"," And the interest on those calls has moved up. "
"24178340","24181300"," There's now 90,000 contracts out there."
"24182580","24184880"," So there's some premium juice going on."

"24200420","24202040"," Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. "
"24202140","24203000"," We were talking about that."
"24206560","24210080"," In Vasco, we talked about soft in the blow, right?"
"24210280","24211640"," Or it's part of all of it."
"24211800","24214520"," There's a bunch of mechanics going on. "
"24214800","24216440"," Part of it is they do want to soften the blow."
"24218560","24221620"," I think that that's like 10-15% of what's going on too."
"24222880","24224380"," And they put it where they want to put it, right?"
"24225020","24227960"," They've already pre-planned the whole fucking thing out. "
"24227960","24228660"," It's like a symphony."

"24248000","24249620"," PayPal, just by the underlying."
"24250860","24252440"," You don't need to buy options on that."
"24252720","24253240"," Just buy some PayPal. "
"24254180","24257180"," I know that you're going to have to hold it for a cycle three to six months."
"24264510","24266490"," Yeah, I think there's a big player in here."
"24266650","24270670"," If I had to guess right now, there's a big player in here and there's short covering. "
"24271550","24273510"," This is an entire short covering operation."
"24274130","24275470"," I'm still bullish here, by the way."
"24283490","24284270"," Yeah, in Vasco. "
"24286350","24287850"," I'm not bearish here at this moment."
"24289050","24290510"," I just want to buy them again."
"24290670","24291210"," I may go not again. "
"24291350","24292090"," I didn't get to buy them at all."
"24298870","24300410"," I know $1.42 now."
"24302110","24303910"," I want them at $1.20, please. "
"24305050","24305830"," Too expensive."
"24307050","24312630"," I figured if I bought them at $1.20, they might have to buy them at $0.60 tomorrow at"
"24312630","24313050"," some point."
"24313550","24321650"," This is the riskiest part of the buy-in of $1.20. $0.60 tomorrow would be"
"24321650","24325910"," averaging into those calls for Friday. "
"24326690","24334630"," But I don't want to miss a melt up if we stay higher than $4.57 or whatever it is"
"24334630","24335010"," for."
"24336750","24343460"," Yeah, $4.57.74. And we're trying to calculate buying in these calls."
"24345120","24346600"," Like, quick math in my mind. "
"24346840","24352800"," So like $1.20, don't mind averaging down to like $0.60. Blackstone, Bravo X-ray, reportedly their"

"24377010","24377750"," It's fucking reasonable. "
"24377750","24379170"," Can I get a reasonable buy-in, please?"
"24380070","24381390"," There's a big player right here."
"24382070","24395230"," someone's doing short like short covering buying short covering buying I"
"24395230","24402510"," guess I guess that's what I'm saying it could be someone just unloading long positions too I guess"
"24402510","24413900"," there's another side of that trade I'm waiting"
"24413900","24425290"," it's either short covering it's somebody or it's somebody cutting loose longs everybody's"
