"4060","5240"," All right, here we go."
"10960","17300"," I'm going to shorten this thing down over here, so I didn't touch this too long. "
"20220","56490"," Let's get right"
"56490","58170"," into it as quick as we can."
"64470","69390"," Sort by NIST. Customization. "
"73350","74670"," Save all that."
"78500","80740"," Good morning, good morning out there."
"80920","81080"," How y "
"81080","94700","'all"
"94700","94700"," doing?"
"95640","100620"," We'll get just watching here, see what's going to happen. "
"100780","103460"," I'll give you guys an update as to what I'm looking at here."
"115410","116750"," Turn all that on."
"117750","119270"," I think everything is good to go. "
"120070","121910"," Oh, no, I got one more thing I'm going to do."
"122750","128009"," A little bit of weakness on the open here this morning."
"129550","131850"," We've got some big economic news coming out. "
"131850","138330"," I don't know if this weakness is, well, I shouldn't say that."
"139130","140590"," I guess we'll start at the top."
"141730","142850"," What am I looking at here?"
"143190","147730"," The first thing is, I've got a couple things I've got to do. "
"148110","149510"," Still have a few more things I've got"
"149510","161830"," to"
"161830","161830"," do."
"163050","172410"," I guess flammablanca or a bot that was"
"172410","180590"," impersonating flammablanca, flammablanca had posted in a private room."
"182110","184190"," I could be wrong on this, but this is my understanding of it. "
"185250","186070"," So bear with me."
"187430","191950"," Look at GME today and AMC today."
"193770","194750"," Let's see here. "
"195990","197830"," We'll look at Tesla as well."
"206290","209550"," This is one of the things that we run into with."
"211810","214730"," This is one of the things that we run into with the Discord. "
"215310","221230"," It being a completely free Discord has been a challenge for us."
"221950","223470"," Let me post that real quick."
"224350","226570"," It's been a challenge for us on Discord. "
"227050","228090"," No matter what Discord does."
"231110","236070"," Not no matter what it does, but when it's a free Discord, anybody can get in."
"236070","241490"," One of the biggest parts of that too is, uh, Scammers and bots who win and get your member lists,"
"241570","243070"," the create fake Discords. "
"243750","245130"," So there's, I think there's two or three."
"249210","252670"," Two or three fake Captain Jim James Discords."
"252730","256550"," It's not the, I'm not the only one this happens to, but it's very common. "
"258529","266030"," To have a, when you have a free Discord for fake Discords to be created, then people start charging"
"266030","268510"," in there as well, which is wild as fuck."
"268950","270130"," Uh, that even happens."
"271930","281210"," So we were talking about, uh, switching over to even a minimally paid Discord, even if it was just"
"281210","283470"," like 110 bucks or something. "
"284050","289250"," Because what that does, it kicks out or it stops the bots and the Scammers and all that stuff."
"289250","295590"," Well, in your Discord, it's like one, just that last extra layer gets rid of them."
"296310","300250"," Uh, so yesterday I was cracking jokes about flama block. "
"300250","303630"," I was like, I was like, fla block is a bear."
"303990","306250"," You know, I'm just fucking around joking about it, but."
"307670","313810"," Uh, I put his trading view handle and it was like poo bear or something and, uh. "
"315150","320050"," I thought that was fun because I could be wrong or something, but I think the general gist at this"
"320050","325610"," point or as of this morning was there was a bot in that, in that private, uh, channel."
"326190","328930"," Uh, we've cleared it up this morning."
"329050","331130"," We put what we think is fun, Blanca. "
"331430","335990"," I don't know if poo bear was, um, one of the regular mods because we had a bunch of bear"
"335990","336510"," mods too."
"336510","338870"," So it could have been, I could have mixed it up, but."
"338870","342550"," Uh, what up, bless to it. "
"342630","343210"," Good morning, brother."
"344030","346010"," Uh, I think we cleared it up though this morning."
"347070","347490"," So. "
"350750","351850"," Fama should be okay."
"352190","352330"," Now."
"353450","356190"," As in terms of price action this morning. "
"356970","360790"," Uh, let's take a quick look at some stuff here."
"360830","361110"," So."
"363310","369390"," I made a, I made a post on Twitter this morning where I said, uh, it's one of those moments"
"369390","372350"," where, uh, people that really. "
"373430","378450"," I guess publicly seem like they hate each other, uh, can rub it in on each other, right?"
"379090","380930"," So at this moment to the stock market where."
"381990","385930"," Uh, you've got everybody weighing in on what they think is going to happen, right?"
"387010","388270"," You got people weighing in."
"388270","392550"," And emotionally weighing in. "
"393410","398630"," Uh, sometimes they are cathartically weighing in on."
"399410","401730"," Uh, they're sentiment, right?"
"401970","403070"," And it's weird."
"403470","406870"," Uh, week or two ago, not too much bear sentiment. "
"408050","409590"," Uh, correction."
"409910","411150"," There was correction sentiment, right?"
"411310","412370"," We start with correction sentiment."
"412650","413450"," We're due for a correction. "
"413890","415210"," We knew that we were due for correction."
"416050","418010"," And, uh, so then we get the correction."
"419130","424230"," And then, of course, at that time period, we're talking about, man, I'd love to buy for 30. "
"425170","428530"," Uh, we trade for 20 and 18, I believe, yes, sir."
"428670","433870"," I think we did 14 yesterday before, whatever, but anyways, we're trading down here, right?"
"434090","435750"," Uh, an extension to the downside."
"437490","439510"," And we're at that next place, right?"
"439730","441190"," We're kind of, we're going to find out. "
"441190","449450"," Uh, if we trade down to that four, three, four, 16, excuse me, four, 12, and even lower."
"449950","452430"," You have lower targets, like four hundred and three."
"452810","454450"," I think it's four thousand and three. "
"454730","456810"," And then we'll look at those targets today, too."
"457730","460610"," Uh, but this is kind of a crucial moment."
"460710","467030"," And the key point here is that, uh, even though we could trade there, there's something looming"
"467030","468870"," larger in the background. "
"469730","475190"," So, you know, you go from, if you remember, as we're trading up, we're like, yeah, we're due for a"
"475190","477450"," correction, you know, we're due for one period."
"478090","481590"," We've made videos about it, like, hey, we're due for a fucking correction here."
"481730","482230"," So we correct. "
"483070","489530"," Uh, but then as we head down, not like, so right where we are right now, uh, you would think"
"489530","493590"," before we had that correction, I'd fucking love to buy that price, right?"
"494130","501770"," Now that we're here, you've got, uh, people raving that's, uh, crashes coming."
"503650","505730"," And why are they raving?"
"506370","508530"," Uh, is because of the extension down."
"508950","515909"," Had we bounced off fourth, uh, 30, that daily trigger would not have, uh, swooped over and down. "
"516070","517390"," It was kind of hanging out up there."
"517390","520130"," Uh, just waiting for price to bounce."
"520510","521470"," A price didn't bounce. "
"522090","524530"," Price traded down below into the 20s."
"525390","531290"," And then it, then the daily trigger began to follow price down to the weekly trigger."
"531750","536710"," And right now it is looming to the upside or just above the weekly trigger. "
"537010","544610"," And this morning, when I woke up, uh, I turned on the triggers and I'm looking at a daily chart"
"544610","545990"," of, uh, SPX."
"547450","550450"," Spy and, uh, Nasdaq, right?"
"551450","558850"," Now Nasdaq doesn't look as bad, believe it or not, but SPX and Spy this morning was like the, if"
"558850","562570"," I forget the weekend scaries or Sunday scaries, it was looking pretty gnarly."
"562750","566830"," It was looking really, um, ominous, right?"
"567050","569850"," So you're either going to get that, thread the needle where we trade higher. "
"573910","577910"," And I mean quickly like explosive moves to the upside."
"580350","583610"," Or, uh, we start rejecting and heading to the downside, right?"
"584450","590910"," Uh, it gets pretty, it's, and I mean downside like, uh, not the kind that you're thinking of."
"591270","592810"," So we'll take a look at that this morning. "
"592810","593610"," We're going to look at why."
"595630","604770"," Why there actually is risk, like there is reason to be concerned here."
"605310","612470"," So if we switch over to the trigger screen here and we go to a daily chart. "
"619420","625200"," And what makes, uh, where we are potentially extremely volatile."
"629340","633280"," Now this little sideways bar here was not here this morning."
"633280","637260"," So, uh, we're going to, we're going to get rid of this little bar here. "
"638420","640760"," This little daily bar was not here."
"649480","657480"," If we can go on here, we're going to make that pitch black."
"658120","663260"," I don't know why this doesn't want to show up, but no, still doesn't want to show up. "
"663600","664560"," I don't know why that is."
"665500","666380"," Okay, fuck it."
"666680","668420"," Anyways, point is this. "
"669100","672200"," The point, the point is that this morning."
"673760","676280"," We can, we can X this out, right?"
"676380","676860"," Yeah, there we go."
"678480","680260"," This is what I woke up to this morning. "
"681260","684920"," And I'm looking at this and I'm like, wow, this, this doesn't look good."
"685540","685680"," Right?"
"686080","687700"," This, this, this doesn't look healthy."
"688760","690160"," Uh, in any way, shape or form, right?"
"691140","694700"," Uh, if you see this, this yellow line is just careening down right now. "
"695100","696180"," And just begging."
"697160","698820"," You know, to reject, right?"
"698820","703960"," So you've got a loss of our, you've got a triggers racing to the downside."
"704940","707120"," And it's just, it's just begging, right?"
"707380","711420"," To, to come up and reject right to the downside. "
"712840","715160"," So to come up here, squeeze our."
"716800","718840"," And then blast down."
"719160","722000"," Now saying squeeze higher and then blast down. "
"722400","726440"," Another famous trick that takes place is pinning."
"727380","732680"," So what you would see is rather than the squeeze, you just see the market get pinned right where we"
"732680","732960"," are."
"733880","735100"," And we just roll. "
"736080","738140"," So remember what I'm saying to you right now."
"738540","741900"," It's important that you remember what I'm saying to you right now because."
"743160","744860"," When I tell you, we're going to squeeze. "
"745580","750420"," And where are they going to squeeze and, uh, we're either going to squeeze and blast through."
"750760","753520"," Uh, or we're going to thread the needle through, right?"
"753700","755000"," That would be where we squeeze up."
"755720","757760"," And thread the needle before the cross happens. "
"758660","759800"," Uh, right?"
"760000","761380"," You get the, so ready for this."
"761420","762920"," You get the squeeze rejection of the downside."
"763080","764660"," You get the squeeze, thread the needle and through. "
"765320","769560"," Or you get, uh, um, repressed price."
"770820","772020"," And then we just roll."
"773500","773940"," Okay. "
"774080","776820"," That's where we don't actually go up time passes."
"777240","781300"," And then we just straight blast to the downside would be choice number three."
"781880","784380"," I guess if you were a fan of gang, you would say some bullshit. "
"784460","788860"," Like we're going to trade the sideways and then make a decision up or down."
"789020","789360"," That's possible."
"789720","794780"," I guess if you're a fan of gang, uh, you could make an argument for that. "
"794820","797300"," But is that really what's going to happen more than likely not?"
"797520","797700"," So."
"799620","800960"," More than likely not."
"801140","802240"," So you're going to get a move. "
"802320","804940"," It's going to be wild and dangerous."
"807040","808700"," Uh, whether the upper downside."
"808700","810940"," I also posted this morning. "
"811460","814280"," Some key levels for you for SPX."
"815480","818500"," And, uh, SPX and spy."
"818820","819180"," I should have. "
"819580","823000"," Should have posted the bottom numbers below the hourly trigger."
"823820","828980"," Cause on spy, it's, uh, 403.64. That's pretty steep, right?"
"829560","832760"," Talking about a 200 point move here on spy."
"834060","834680"," If it rejects. "
"835340","837500"," So it's a pretty big deal, right?"
"837500","840920"," You're, it's, it's not, it's not, it's not nothing to be trifled with joke with."
"842000","843460"," Uh, it's implications."
"845800","847820"," And you can see right now we are. "
"848100","849540"," So this is a one minute chart, right?"
"850200","853320"," And currently, uh, price is still."
"854480","855240"," Let me see."
"855340","856880"," I got some walkiness going on here. "
"857920","859220"," Make sure I got that right."
"860460","864320"," Price is still rejecting right here off the hourly trigger, right?"
"864560","865840"," So we got to get above that hourly."
"865840","867060"," This is some important. "
"867880","872780"," Uh, uh, like delineator for you if you're a bull."
"873080","875460"," So you do not want to be underneath this daily trigger."
"876000","878720"," Or see the hourly trigger in any way, shape or form. "
"879000","881060"," Currently we are underneath that hourly trigger."
"881160","881960"," You see it right there."
"882400","885400"," That's the green line or the HT that's right here. "
"885680","887120"," We want to be above that."
"887400","887580"," Okay."
"887660","888700"," So we need to be above that. "
"889020","890320"," I mean, price above."
"891380","892240"," The one, the five."
"893040","894560"," And the hourly trigger. "
"895460","897020"," To make that move higher."
"897920","899500"," So if you're a bull, right?"
"899820","901860"," I guess if you're, if you're a buyer or a bull."
"902580","904320"," You need price above that hourly trigger. "
"905040","909140"," Uh, and you need to attack the weekly and daily trigger."
"909300","911600"," I think they're almost down to four, 30 and four, 35."
"912380","917180"," If you don't, uh, or if you fail or if price stays underneath those things. "
"917980","919660"," Or rejects those two higher numbers."
"920360","921900"," Uh, it does not bode well for you."
"921900","923500"," Now for myself. "
"924360","926180"," Uh, I place the trade."
"926920","929260"," Uh, and the belief that we are going to go up here."
"929620","933140"," Now I do think that we're going to, I personally believe that we're going to go up. "
"933400","934420"," Reject and go lower."
"934840","938940"," I still think like four, 50 or four, 14, four, 16s on the table."
"939460","944840"," Uh, either today or even if we squeeze, we come back down and slam that lower number. "
"945140","947460"," And then bounce and run for the rest of October."
"948200","951180"," Uh, but saying that saying all of that."
"951180","956920"," Uh, the whole hand grenades and horseshoes thesis, right?"
"957480","963360"," I still don't want to see us trade, uh, down here. "
"963500","965140"," I don't want to see us bouncing down here."
"965140","967180"," So this is kind of my place down here."
"967820","969200"," Like, so where this is right here?"
"969380","970920"," I don't care if we come down here. "
"971620","972600"," Come back up."
"973120","978140"," Uh, but I definitely, if I see us heading down here today, uh, it's going to make me want to"
"978140","978400"," sell."
"978400","981360"," Uh, it's not going to make me want to stay in this trade down here. "
"981520","983760"," So I'm going to assume at this point."
"985400","987900"," That this prior low here, this four, 2018."
"989980","994360"," Somewhere down in here is going to be like the max pain for you as a bull. "
"995080","997100"," Uh, this is where they were buying, right?"
"1000180","1002140"," So I'm going to, I'm going to guess here."
"1003560","1008000"," I'm going to guess here if you want to, if, if you try into, if you're going to go up"
"1008000","1011200"," and you're trying to put the pain on, it's down here, right?"
"1011940","1015620"," That's where the actual pain is, uh, for a bottom buyer, dip buyer."
"1016420","1018900"," So pay attention to that to this zone down here. "
"1019020","1021800"," This is four, 20, 59, four, 20, 18."
"1022860","1028599"," And you know what I don't want to see happen is, uh, I don't want to see the rejection, right?"
"1029720","1032920"," And then we come down here and slam down into that four, 16, 84."
"1032920","1036619"," It's going to, it'll, it'll most definitely trigger, trigger my long here. "
"1037380","1039119"," Uh, and I don't want to see any of this stuff either."
"1039319","1045740"," I guess there could be an argument that we bounced down here, but I am super afraid of that bounce."
"1046560","1050020"," I'm super afraid of that bounce and then this daily trigger coming down. "
"1050240","1053380"," So the idea here would be, hold on here."
"1055080","1059320"," The idea here would be if we were to head down to the downside, right?"
"1059320","1062500"," And you're like, all the, all's clear cap, no big deal."
"1063140","1064360"," We're going to buy this dip. "
"1064840","1069280"," But this daily trigger actually comes down to this weekly."
"1070040","1077160"," And whatever bounce this is, uh, is a major rejection because you'd have a daily trigger, a weekly"
"1077160","1080840"," trigger, uh, likely an hourly trigger stuck up here."
"1080860","1085960"," And you get a three trigger bear cross or bear rejection here. "
"1085960","1090820"," This would be like the death, uh, the death trade for the market."
"1091160","1099300"," So, uh, I would be really wary, uh, to put any risk on with this kind of price action down"
"1099300","1099560"," here."
"1101080","1108140"," Um, it would force me to only rebuy with the, with a price, breaking through that weekly and daily"
"1108140","1110960"," and picking it up right up here somewhere in here. "
"1110960","1115560"," But, uh, you know, any of this action down here, I want nothing to do with it."
"1115560","1120540"," You know, I don't, and I'm more afraid of this, uh, this rejection of the downside."
"1121260","1124560"," I don't know if that does happen now. "
"1124980","1126700"," Making all those statements there, right?"
"1127740","1130700"," Uh, it's kind of kind of like your sealed fate down here."
"1130700","1132000"," Kind of know what's coming."
"1132700","1133500"," Kind of stuff. "
"1133780","1136140"," So the bulls kind of put out their ass, right?"
"1136360","1137260"," They got to, they got to do this."
"1137320","1137840"," They got to do that."
"1138440","1139540"," And they got to escape. "
"1139980","1141380"," That's the thread, the needle trade."
"1141380","1149500"," They have to escape, um, escape all that doom and gloom that the bears are selling out there."
"1150480","1152700"," So, uh, we'll see how this plays out. "
"1153120","1155060"," We do have some economic news."
"1155920","1158480"," Uh, people are claiming could be the catalyst."
"1159520","1164460"," Um, so we'll, you know, we'll see if there, if there really is, you've got, uh, the unemployment"
"1164460","1167540"," report tomorrow morning unemployment rate as well. "
"1168580","1171840"," Hourly wages, uh, at eight 30 tomorrow morning."
"1172520","1173860"," This morning we had claims."
"1175160","1179980"," And, uh, we had Cleveland, uh, Fed President Meister speaking that at 12 today, we actually have"
"1179980","1182480"," daily speaking and bar speaking. "
"1183060","1184300"," Uh, so we'll find out."
"1184680","1187120"," We'll find out who's right and who's wrong."
"1187480","1190080"," I don't know if it really matters who's right or who's wrong either. "
"1190380","1194180"," As long as you're aware where we are matters the most."
"1194180","1198620"," So as long as you know that if we reject and start selling this hourly trigger."
"1199280","1200120"," You know where we're headed. "
"1200800","1204600"," You know that if we get above that hourly trigger and start trading up that weekly in daily."
"1205280","1207580"," Where we're headed and what to expect, right?"
"1207760","1208880"," You're prepared for it."
"1209240","1212340"," Uh, off or down, whatever the end, whatever that answer may be. "
"1212900","1217460"," Uh, and that awareness is more of the fight than you even real, not you realize, but."
"1217820","1221200"," A lot of people don't have that, uh, that awareness of what that means."
"1221200","1224360"," We start breaking through and actually see it right here. "
"1226020","1227380"," You actually see it right here."
"1227440","1228140"," It's like the last."
"1228880","1230760"," It's kind of like the last place. "
"1230840","1232220"," Like, watch this cursor right here."
"1232300","1233000"," It's like the last."
"1235660","1237240"," Uh, the rug right here. "
"1237300","1240560"," I guess you call this the rug pull right here because underneath this there ain't shit, right?"
"1240760","1241860"," There ain't nothing underneath this."
"1243140","1244920"," And, uh, it ain't pretty down below."
"1245340","1247560"," Uh, most definitely you can actually see it right here. "
"1247880","1249060"," But it's not pretty down there."
"1249060","1250860"," It's kind of like Sia."
"1251380","1253260"," Uh, and that's where the market goes. "
"1253280","1257980"," It kind of, it kind of is just a bit just bad as that cross takes place."
"1258560","1264280"," As that daily trigger crosses that weekly should be pretty nasty should be."
"1264780","1267900"," Uh, the results typically are some kind of a crash. "
"1267940","1270560"," Uh, not just correction at that point."
"1270820","1275120"," When you're seeing weakness right now, uh, S&P 500 trade and 422 50."
"1276020","1276940"," Let me see if I can go. "
"1277240","1278840"," Oh, I'm already showing it right now."
"1279360","1281100"," Let me bring my remote over here."
"1281280","1282740"," Remote my, uh, mouse. "
"1283300","1286880"," You're seeing rejection off of this 420, 420, 384."
"1287300","1290400"," I'm trying to trade this down right now."
"1293420","1295800"," Weakness in the S&P 500. "
"1296240","1298120"," I'm just gonna put this on the screen so you can see it."
"1300320","1302000"," Breaking below the previous low."
"1302400","1304660"," Uh, next target to the downside is yesterday's low. "
"1304660","1307500"," That is where S1 is down below here."
"1308000","1309540"," So you can see it in the bottom screen."
"1310320","1311700"," Watch my cursor down here. "
"1311780","1313160"," You'll see this previous low here."
"1313440","1322940"," And then you've got, uh, the low of the morning yesterday at 420.56. 420, uh, 0.56. Also note"
"1322940","1324340"," down here this purple line."
"1324860","1326220"," Let's see if I can make this large. "
"1327380","1328460"," So you can see it."
"1328880","1330080"," This is where I bought in."
"1330380","1332080"," And this whole zone down here. "
"1332080","1333460"," This is where the max pain is."
"1334100","1336020"," For this is where the max pain is."
"1336020","1337200"," Or any dip buyers. "
"1338180","1338900"," Right down here."
"1339080","1340640"," So pay close attention to that."
"1341760","1343200"," And, uh, we'll see. "
"1343460","1345120"," We'll see if we're bearish here or not."
"1345200","1346760"," If we're gonna end up rolling this market."
"1347180","1348480"," Uh, or not. "
"1348720","1353320"," This would be a fundamental, uh, trend change for S&P 500."
"1353320","1353860"," The cues."
"1355680","1357820"," And, uh, we would see it. "
"1358080","1361520"," You definitely see it with the panic sets in."
"1365800","1366840"," It'll be fun to watch."
"1367760","1371120"," Uh, it will, it will most, most certainly be fun to watch. "
"1372740","1373140"," Morning."
"1373260","1373740"," How's everybody doing?"
"1374360","1375380"," Good to see you all this morning."
"1376140","1377560"," Uh, I got something else to tell you this morning. "
"1377780","1379220"," I, I will not be here."
"1380000","1382080"," Uh, later it this afternoon."
"1383140","1388700"," I have in, I didn't know this and I found this out last night, but I have a doctor's appointment"
"1388700","1391520"," today at two 30 in the afternoon. "
"1392540","1393700"," That I have to attend."
"1394260","1397280"," So I, I have to like get ready to go to this thing."
"1398860","1400840"," At 12 30 ish or so. "
"1401140","1403900"," So what I'll do is I will leave the stream up today."
"1404620","1406340"," Uh, while I go to this appointment."
"1407000","1409540"," So I'm going to ask the moderators on Twitch and YouTube. "
"1410180","1412360"," Uh, to moderate the chat for me."
"1413040","1417700"," Uh, while I'm gone and then I'll leave the stream up until four p.m. I think I should be"
"1417700","1418300"," back by four."
"1418460","1420680"," If not, I'll have somebody turn it off for me, but. "
"1421160","1425820"," You'll have the stream up today, even though I won't be here for the later part of the day."
"1425940","1426560"," A lot of part of the day."
"1428020","1428760"," Good to see you Jimmy. "
"1429040","1429220"," Hey, man."
"1429520","1430420"," Been doing really good."

"1438010","1438910"," Uh, 100%."
"1438910","1441370"," Uh, people are, people are freaking out."
"1441530","1444770"," When you start seeing rich people freaking out, I'm like, eh, something's wrong. "
"1450390","1453590"," Trading down to S one right now, looking to trade four, two, one point."
"1453990","1455090"," Six, six."
"1456470","1456870"," Spooze. "
"1456970","1458590"," Well, let me put these on this chart here."
"1458710","1459250"," So you have the targets."

"1592840","1593540"," Thanks, Basra. "

"1609640","1610440"," This morning."

"1612620","1613880"," We corrected that this morning. "
"1614600","1618440"," If any of you out there are moderators and you're like, I don't have access."
"1619320","1620960"," Let me know in the chat right now."

"1774490","1775190"," So slightly lower."
"1779190","1780590"," What else we got here?"
"1780590","1782830"," Yeah, we're waiting on NFP for tomorrow. "
"1786730","1795830"," Now VIX is trading 19% below at the money vault, shifting higher."
"1797690","1798710"," What else we got here?"
"1800290","1800870"," That's it."
"1801010","1802630"," That's all I got for you this morning on gamma. "
"1827080","1828980"," I'm setting up a trade right now for calls."
"1830720","1835120"," Now supposedly we are close to bottom here on the put wall."
"1835440","1838740"," So I'm looking at 424 C's right now. "
"1838780","1842680"," They're 34 cents, currently 35 cents on the bid ask."
"1843540","1844860"," So 424 C."
"1845900","1850460"," I'm not going to trade this just yet, but I am looking to here in just a moment."
"1851060","1853580"," I don't want to get caught in a rejection here. "
"1854560","1858480"," So right here, I don't want to get caught in this rejection to the downside."
"1859040","1860660"," Catch this and go lower than S1."
"1862000","1863820"," There's a small trade in here. "
"1864100","1865720"," There's a brief trade I should say."
"1867300","1872120"," There's a brief trade right here, but I'd really like to see some kind of a turnaround like this."
"1873400","1874860"," And then maybe pick it up right there. "
"1876100","1879060"," At 4.2260. So we'll see."
"1879560","1885700"," Oh, I should have bought that."
"1891530","1892210"," Patience, patience. "
"1894830","1896830"," I should have bought that, but whatever patience."
"1897690","1900570"," So we were supposedly at bottom ish right now close."
"1901250","1901990"," We'll see what happens. "
"1907470","1908050"," What up?"
"1909210","1910590"," Is that mission P777?"
"1911270","1911710"," What's up, brother?"
"1912810","1913830"," Good to see you this morning."
"1917680","1921920"," Let me let a check an email real quick for a message I got to check on."
"1932340","1934800"," Known firm payrolls. "
"1938470","1941290"," Check this right here."
"1954980","1956560"," Got told knowing that one."
"1959400","1959940"," Yeah. "
"1971180","1971780"," You know."
"1976340","1979620"," If I had if I had if I had picked a second."
"1981620","1983800"," If I had to pick a second. "
"1983800","1989320"," Or if I was a child as an adult."
"1989920","1993880"," I was going to as an adult look back and say."
"1994660","1997120"," What would have been something you would have liked to have. "
"1998060","1999100"," I've learned this."
"1999380","2002840"," I've learned parts of this, not recently, but when I was younger."
"2005220","2005980"," I did some code. "
"2006120","2007740"," Matter of fact, I did coding when I was a kid."
"2008460","2010320"," I used to have the Commodore 64."
"2010800","2014600"," I used to have a bunch of an Apple 2e 2c. "
"2014820","2015240"," All that stuff."
"2015460","2015620"," 2e."
"2015920","2016120"," Yeah. "
"2016420","2016780"," Apple 2e."
"2017140","2018480"," I even had an Apple 2gs."
"2020560","2022240"," I used to code when I was a kid. "
"2022360","2022840"," Used to get magazines."
"2023320","2024200"," Used to go down to a bookstore."
"2025160","2026840"," Get magazines and I did coding. "
"2029140","2030780"," And fell in and out of it through my life."
"2031000","2035800"," But never like took it up as a career path or stayed in it to where I know it."
"2035800","2037520"," Like I have no idea what I'm doing with coding. "
"2037600","2038000"," None."
"2038760","2039160"," Zero."
"2040100","2043120"," But I wish I had and I wish I had stuck with it all those years. "
"2043860","2047460"," There's one thing that could have learned that bothers me now."
"2048460","2049520"," It's probably that."
"2052620","2054480"," Because I have no idea what that was like. "
"2054760","2056080"," Or in the grand scheme of things."
"2056980","2059080"," Like I relate it to like cooking."
"2060659","2062620"," You can be a decent home cook. "
"2062960","2067280"," But you're never going to be what a professional Comey is or a chef."
"2069900","2073120"," And you'd be laughed right out of the room if you try to."
"2073219","2075920"," Even if it's like I guess the point being is even if you're a good like. "
"2077300","2079120"," Coder at home or something."
"2079719","2084739"," Generally speaking a professional is going to still be light years ahead of you."
"2085199","2088460"," Not even the same ballpark in my view. "
"2088800","2091719"," So kind of wish that I had done that though."
"2092320","2093360"," I could go back."
"2093659","2096360"," That's probably some probably go to school for it. "
"2099280","2102360"," You still have your C64 and 128."
"2103080","2103700"," Holy shit."
"2103780","2104700"," I had the 128 too. "
"2105060","2105520"," I had the 128."
"2106260","2107220"," My dad was awesome."
"2107320","2107620"," My dad. "
"2108500","2109080"," My dad was like."
"2109960","2110980"," I wanted something like that."
"2111100","2112420"," He was on it was like you want a computer?"
"2113740","2116000"," I had a Commodore 128 too. "
"2116100","2117260"," That was the pinnacle for me."
"2117460","2118280"," I think that was the pinnacle."
"2119000","2126060"," I think the Commodore 128 was the pinnacle until was it like a 286 or a 386 or 486 or"
"2126060","2127140"," something like that came out. "
"2127720","2129540"," I think the Commodore was like."
"2130540","2133900"," The I think I could be remembers remembering this."
"2134000","2139980"," But I thought the Commodore 128 and the Apple 2 GS was like the shit at one point. "
"2141300","2144260"," Until you started getting into much larger scale computing."
"2144260","2145140"," I could be wrong in that."
"2145240","2146220"," But let me know if I'm wrong in that. "
"2151290","2152030"," Circular 2000."
"2152570","2155090"," Don't know what that is."
"2157940","2158260"," Yeah. "
"2162020","2166500"," I saw the 10 get I saw the 10 year get bounced this morning."
"2167680","2168800"," I looked at the 10 year."
"2169020","2171580"," I saw the 10 year roll and then I watched the 10 year bounce this morning. "
"2173300","2182540"," All right."
"2182620","2182880"," Fuck it."
"2182900","2183140"," I'm long. "
"2184420","2185620"," That didn't take long."
"2186500","2187360"," I'm long here."
"2187420","2188640"," I hope it don't get rolled to the downside. "
"2192300","2194700"," I'm like there ain't no fucking puts down there."
"2195000","2198860"," I'm like they're going to park this shit and wait for fucking NFP tomorrow."
"2200140","2201340"," So we'll see. "
"2201740","2203640"," Make your place your bets for a."
"2204460","2205380"," Friday doom."
"2207940","2213140"," Yeah, I was right the 46."
"2213640","2217380"," I think that I think the I think that like that era. "
"2218600","2220000"," Tell me if I'm wrong in the chat."
"2221680","2224100"," I think there was like this whole era of."
"2225760","2227220"," Apples and Commodore's. "
"2227220","2229520"," And then we went like."
"2230200","2233780"," I think the 128 like 2 GS was like the pinnacle."
"2234280","2237420"," And then it was like on like 46 like three. "
"2237580","2238920"," I think there was a I could be wrong."
"2239120","2240680"," There might not have been a 286 by a store."
"2240840","2242820"," There was a 386 a 46. "
"2243240","2244560"," There was like a whole bunch of."
"2245640","2247680"," PCs you could start building them and shit."
"2247820","2248380"," It was really cool. "
"2248580","2249980"," It was like a really cool transition."
"2253260","2256680"," It was 386 and 46 I'm trying to remember this off."
"2257360","2259980"," Like recall here from a very young age. "
"2261420","2263760"," Okay, so there was a xt there was a 286."
"2263880","2266180"," Okay, so I'm not just making shit up now, right."
"2268640","2270300"," And then there was like. "
"2270920","2272600"," I felt like there was a big movement there."
"2272600","2274440"," There were like a large like shift in."
"2274720","2276400"," You know what else is fascinating is. "
"2276600","2283400"," I was just reading a someone had clipped a some some some some some person from England."
"2284040","2285020"," A blogger."
"2287240","2290680"," Was bitch in her moaning about how. "
"2292260","2294280"," The humanities suck."
"2295580","2299400"," The humanities suck and students should be learning technical."
"2301440","2304400"," Or pursuing technical college degrees. "
"2305520","2306440"," They can actually get paid."
"2306840","2307740"," That's not actually a bad idea."
"2308040","2310860"," But she wrote another blog post that said. "
"2313260","2314580"," Humanities are now dying."
"2315400","2316480"," And that's a problem."
"2316860","2318800"," So it was like a self a werewolf moment to right. "
"2319740","2323420"," She was like fuck the humanities then she's like oh no the humanities are going away."
"2323540","2324020"," We're all fucked."
"2325260","2328320"," And I'm always fascinated by that argument about the humanities. "
"2329140","2332440"," And computing especially hardware the hardware side of things."
"2334680","2340720"," Well if you speak to a programmer in a closed room and no one is listening right."
"2341360","2345840"," They will admit that there's like something something that they admit which is. "
"2350140","2353500"," Kids today and I shouldn't say this because it sounds like such a boomer comments."
"2354200","2356280"," The kids today are they're on their phones."
"2356780","2358400"," It's like I'm on my phone and that's it right. "
"2359120","2362320"," So a lot of kids some kids learn how to build PCs."
"2363640","2365160"," But most kids don't."
"2365640","2367960"," And most kids even my kids like. "
"2368500","2369920"," I know how to do everything off my phone."
"2370040","2373460"," Well once going to this computer and we'll look at this error code to tell me what that means."
"2373500","2374400"," I'll be like I have no idea. "
"2374860","2379080"," It's like there was a time period I guess my point here is that there was a time period where."
"2381160","2382280"," There's a time period where."
"2385260","2390900"," There was a time period where if you're a kid if you were you were learning coding on computers"
"2390900","2391580"," like PCs. "
"2393240","2397980"," Big hardware right or you like you're a software toad software people call you."
"2398280","2400000"," And there's like hardware people right."
"2400240","2402940"," So you'd be like trying to build computers like doing one of these two big things. "
"2403160","2404460"," Now it's not like that as much right."
"2406180","2410480"," I could be wrong on that but I guess the same thing comes back to humanities too."
"2412940","2415540"," Like my kids will be like yeah look at this phone everything is awesome. "
"2415680","2419120"," And I'm like yeah but who built that phone like that she's like it's my generation."
"2419120","2421240"," I'm like you're just a child."
"2421760","2426680"," I'm like all that shit's been built by people that had humanities degrees. "
"2427080","2430320"," Not well not all of them but from old people."
"2430940","2433780"," So what are you building in your age is probably not this."
"2434040","2439100"," I don't know what it is probably bigger but I guess that brings up the question does it. "
"2440000","2444380"," Will the humanities the loss of humanities will that impact the future or not."
"2444560","2445980"," Maybe for the better I guess I don't know."
"2445980","2449180"," People are I guess we're losing the humanities so we'll find out but. "
"2455380","2462880"," Yeah kids are like they're all learning how to code on phones and it's like phone phone phone phone"
"2462880","2463200"," phone phone phone."
"2468140","2470780"," Don't like seeing this rejection here off this one minute trigger."
"2472900","2474320"," Down to pennies right now. "
"2480150","2484370"," I'm going to pay close attention here because I see this rejection candle right here."
"2485190","2486770"," Right down there I don't want to see that."
"2493320","2494780"," Need to see that break above. "
"2504420","2505920"," Yeah I'm afraid of that."
"2506700","2511180"," I like the mix and blend of people learning tech."
"2512480","2516480"," Learning hardware learning software of the humanity aspect. "
"2519080","2522820"," Father's me deeply especially if you you're highly intelligent."
"2523940","2528420"," And maybe you said well I want to go into humanities but I'm going to choose."
"2529700","2531020"," Tech degree instead. "
"2532440","2537580"," When we need a class of we always my view we need a we always need a class of people"
"2537580","2537960"," that."
"2539780","2544140"," Care about the humanities you know somewhere I feel like I've noticed I could be wrong in this but."
"2544720","2548640"," Feel it or where I where I feel it mostly is in books. "
"2549320","2553060"," When I read or when I when I look at the selection of books today."
"2555020","2556640"," That are being published."
"2558440","2560020"," I noticed less and less. "
"2561380","2562580"," Breath to."
"2566160","2569840"," Novels specifically novels the nonfiction stuff seems okay."
"2571040","2571860"," But the. "
"2573280","2578520"," Like the like novels of the selections dropping it's going down and there's some self publishing"
"2578520","2579120"," going on."
"2579400","2581380"," With real talent and stuff like that but."
"2581980","2584080"," Maybe I guess I'm looking talking about that. "
"2584080","2588740"," It's kind of like when you vote right you got the left the right the middle and like that middle"
"2588740","2590440"," there can go either way."
"2591520","2594540"," I think with writers it's the same kind of a deal right."
"2595240","2600940"," You might have let's say you had a hundred writers 20 years ago or 40 years ago. "
"2601860","2607400"," Let's see a hundred writers then today you might skim off 20 of those writers that are going to go."
"2608060","2610180"," To a text to a tech."
"2612100","2614060"," Background instead of writing background. "
"2615440","2617820"," Some of those really smart people right."
"2618380","2619420"," You don't want to lose them."
"2623400","2626220"," God damn it man they're trying to reverse this the downside. "
"2627340","2628640"," You're going to put a fucking."
"2632900","2634580"," I might just stay in these things."
"2635000","2635840"," Look at me I'm terrible. "
"2636260","2638020"," Like going against my own."
"2638440","2639980"," I'm like I just stand until the end of the day."
"2640720","2642460"," Like any crashes today I don't know. "
"2646090","2648210"," Hey thanks cowboy up nine I'd appreciate it brother."
"2650250","2651750"," I got something to do here."
"2669020","2673220"," That's exactly where it's supposed to be okay it's good that's"
"2675370","2682190"," good. "
"2682190","2686290"," By hammering on the door of s one trying to break lower right now."
"2687130","2692430"," Hammering on that s one next stop to the downside if we do roll here is."
"2693310","2695230"," Four eighteen sixty seven. "
"2697450","2700110"," Saying that there's also."
"2704640","2706660"," What's that what's that some lines here."
"2714420","2716660"," That one. "
"2717520","2718460"," That yellow."
"2719820","2721080"," Make it."
"2721660","2721960"," Test. "
"2723780","2728040"," And we'll do another one at four twenty eighteen."
"2730720","2734840"," We'll do another one."
"2736300","2738280"," One nineteen ninety nine. "
"2741960","2747300"," That's kind of where I am right there so this little little little shop of horrors down here."
"2764800","2768860"," Right down there there's your s two there's your s one."
"2773300","2776500"," And they're viciously selling this one minute trigger right now. "
"2777080","2780060"," And see that that rejection right up here."
"2781520","2784780"," Can't try to try to blast this down right there."
"2802670","2803970"," Still on calls here. "
"2804630","2805930"," I'm gonna bring this down."
"2821760","2826380"," Yeah there's yearly triggers we've got yearly I got monthly quarterly yearly triggers."
"2827200","2830720"," On higher time frames you can watch the velocity and that stuff too. "
"2831360","2832280"," Good question."
"2834140","2837820"," We can actually give targets for crashes to with those triggers."
"2839280","2842220"," We can give those all the way back to the beginning of the stock market. "
"2843060","2844420"," What you expect on those lows."
"2856150","2856990"," Trust the indicator."
"2862530","2866210"," Why I'm in calls here because there's no put we're in a put wall right now. "
"2866210","2870170"," So why am I buying why am I in calls here we're on a put wall."
"2870810","2874550"," We're a few ticks but a few ticks above that put wall."
"2875750","2879190"," So unless you start loading the fucking boat with puts and getting scared. "
"2880590","2882130"," We shouldn't break through it."
"2882130","2883430"," Now there can be some grinding."
"2884850","2886810"," Can be some grinding down in here. "
"2887990","2889830"," But we are we are close."
"2890130","2892390"," Let me show you where the put wall is you guys want to see where it is."
"2892590","2894330"," Someone was asking about it. "
"2898070","2902670"," Maybe I can give me one quick second."
"2903150","2904950"," There's some like some some cool I can do here."
"2907310","2909230"," I got something for you hold on a second here. "
"2912860","2914720"," I got something cool I think I do."
"2916120","2919000"," I think I got some cool quick second."
"2921080","2922680"," And then we'll look at SPX. "
"2923620","2925760"," I got to have a nice little snapshot for you."
"2929260","2930780"," Again again again again levels."
"2933080","2933940"," Gamma levels. "
"2934500","2934740"," Okay."
"2936780","2939140"," Gonna do us some gamma levels bro."
"2940880","2946710"," I think Taiwan second I'll get you some gamma levels. "
"2950050","2952030"," I gotta I gotta pop them in."
"3002840","3004440"," I'm close to getting stopped out here."
"3015370","3016490"," One quick second here. "
"3018090","3021110"," I'm gonna pay attention to this trade."
"3114810","3117030"," Yeah, I'm gonna get about to get stopped out just a moment here."
"3117870","3119170"," I got like one or two pennies. "
"3119310","3120130"," They're trying to fuck me on."
"3168230","3177540"," And there it is."
"3178560","3179740"," I'm flat right now. "
"3201320","3203780"," Long for 19 P."
"3205460","3208180"," Stopped out of calls long puts."
"3208700","3210540"," That wasn't too fucking long."
"3211440","3213420"," Got stopped out on 23 on. "
"3215080","3217160"," 424 C's."
"3218000","3218920"," Now long puts."
"3219500","3221020"," For S two. "
"3221980","3222900"," Not much."
"3222900","3227080"," Only 10 contracts on the calls and then another 10 for S two."
"3227280","3232640"," So now long for 19 P's for S two to the downside. "
"3234340","3235620"," Fucking pennies, dude."
"3235740","3238340"," Always like always like one fucking penny."
"3239560","3242160"," And I'm stopped the fuck out just like that. "
"3243820","3246360"," Two pennies went down to fucking pennies."
"3247500","3250500"," And that fucking this one right here took me right out."
"3251120","3253220"," This fucking this one right here. "
"3255700","3256960"," That one right there."
"3257220","3257800"," Boom gone."
"3258660","3259840"," Now long puts. "
"3264060","3266120"," Not a goddamn thing."
"3268120","3270500"," If this if this reverses him, he pissed."
"3275680","3277400"," Dude, there's the right decision. "
"3277640","3278520"," Look at that was the right decision."
"3283040","3284440"," Trading 31 right now."
"3284620","3286240"," 30 on 419 P's. "
"3287160","3288380"," Price target to the downside."
"3289380","3294560"," Or at least my price target to the downside of 4, 9, 4, 18, 60, 7."
"3301640","3302920"," Trading 28 right now."
"3321720","3324860"," If you want to know where my stops are going to be on this trade here. "
"3327580","3329900"," Right there."
"3418230","3420770"," It's kind of one of these things where I'm watching this action today."
"3420770","3421770"," And I'm like, you know what?"
"3422070","3423450"," I'm not going to sell like this. "
"3423770","3428390"," I should have left these fucking calls on puts on leaving both on end of day."
"3428830","3430670"," This is where we're going to this is what our action is going to be."
"3431470","3433850"," I'm going up doing a split here. "
"3440620","3441760"," Still on some puts."
"3441940","3444120"," I'm on 10 contracts for 419 P."
"3447860","3453800"," If we squeeze higher here, I'm likely going to leave these puts on and actually add calls and do a"
"3453800","3455400"," do a split on the day."
"3458200","3460360"," 424 is now at 30 cents. "
"3460880","3464520"," So I got stopped out at 23 took me for seven pennies."
"3466840","3467640"," I got us."
"3467940","3471120"," I got four 24 set up again, but not buying them just yet. "
"3487150","3488570"," You know, this price action here."
"3488670","3493230"," I'm watching this and I'm like, man, I'm not going to tell anyone my fucking trades because I"
"3493230","3496790"," always feel like I'm telling my trades here."
"3496910","3500810"," And someone's watching on a hedge fund trying to get my fucking hit my fucking stops. "
"3501310","3501650"," I'm serious."
"3501870","3502450"," I'm not joking here."
"3502930","3504090"," Pretty goddamn serious. "
"3508280","3509400"," Still long puts here."
"3530040","3532120"," They're just fucking stop hunting, dude."
"3532320","3533800"," Watch this stop hunting in here. "
"3533980","3535060"," It's fucking gnarly."
"3536500","3538360"," I think about calls here."
"3538520","3540040"," The camera was there or there about calls. "
"3540880","3542260"," I think it was here about calls."
"3542660","3543720"," Got stopped out down here."
"3544020","3544380"," Got some puts. "
"3545380","3546380"," Trying to stop me out up here."
"3550210","3551010"," All right."
"3551390","3551990"," Fuck you then. "
"3555910","3563550"," I have 25 contracts and 424 C's, 10 contracts, 419 P."
"3564090","3566850"," So I want to split for right now at 424, 419."
"3568050","3568930"," Leave both sides on."
"3569090","3570850"," We'll see where the market decides to go. "
"3571170","3572210"," Cut the other side in a moment."
"3572950","3575370"," I don't want to sit around here and dick around with these stops in here."
"3575850","3576850"," I'm just going to leave both sides on. "
"3576930","3578850"," I got 25 contracts, 424 C."
"3578850","3581150"," 10 contracts on 419 C."
"3582810","3587310"," I'm going to see if this holds and goes up and see if it rolls to the downside."
"3588470","3590390"," I'm going to at least protect this trade in here."
"3590770","3594570"," So I'll get back to what we're doing. "
"3594930","3595070"," All right."
"3595130","3595610"," Hold on a second here."
"3599150","3602050"," We want a quick second here. "
"3609940","3610860"," Bring up the gamma."
"3619710","3621110"," It's even show gamma."
"3623030","3624950"," Here's a gamma chart for SPX. "
"3627110","3629950"," They've got resistance here at."
"3634620","3641500"," 4, 2, 3, 5, 12, and then to the downside support is at 4,200 today."
"3642020","3645400"," So as long as we keep rejecting here, so you can watch this here. "
"3645500","3646660"," This is your gamma profile."
"3647320","3652620"," As long as we keep rejecting this zone, your target to the downside is that 4,200."
"3653440","3655740"," We start keep rejecting this to the downside. "
"3656300","3657080"," If we break above."
"3658960","3660240"," You know what the deal is."
"3660400","3662400"," This is also where the hourly trigger is right above here. "
"3663980","3664740"," Where is it?"
"3664900","3665740"," No, it's the early trigger."
"3666080","3666540"," Excuse me."
"3666680","3667660"," Is up here. "
"3669140","3670120"," Somewhere up in here."
"3670280","3670820"," So right now."
"3671880","3676700"," Nothing to sand on the gamma side of things other than. "
"3677020","3680800"," You don't want to see us below this resistance line right here."
"3680900","3682060"," This big R right here."
"3684600","3688360"," So parked on 25 calls to the upside. "
"3688900","3691260"," We've got 10 puts to protect the downside."
"3692780","3696000"," In case we get the roll down there and trade that 4,200."
"3696000","3699820"," But otherwise get I got stopped out of my first trade. "
"3700400","3702400"," And I'm not liking the action."
"3702680","3707100"," It feels like it feels like a stop hunting more than anything."
"3707700","3709560"," So we didn't blast down here. "
"3709680","3711100"," So no blast to the downside."
"3712420","3712520"," Right."
"3712880","3716080"," And they're just grind and like grind this grind this fake out. "
"3716080","3718240"," So 25 calls 10 puts."
"3718640","3719640"," Show me what's up."
"3720000","3722580"," This is the kind of thing today like watching this action. "
"3722920","3726280"," It's kind of thing where I'm just going to fucking hold him to the close and whatever they whatever"
"3726280","3727460"," they print they fucking print."
"3728200","3729100"," We're not going to get a move."
"3729680","3730300"," Then fuck them. "
"3736860","3738240"," That's what we're going to we're going to sit here."
"3738300","3739600"," We're going to park here all day long."
"3739980","3741320"," Just get me a print on either side. "
"3742600","3746480"," I'll take either side because the put side should cover the cost of the call side."
"3747060","3750620"," If it prints and if the fucking calls go they should make me some actual money."
"3750920","3752320"," So my bias is bullshit. "
"3753060","3754260"," But I do have protection on."
"3759410","3761350"," And they both stay on the rest of the day."
"3761650","3763390"," I think the rest of the day until four. "
"3764950","3770590"," Yeah, I'm watching this action."
"3770830","3775550"," I'm like, yeah, I fucking hate when we have this action and we have price action like this."
"3775550","3777890"," I'm like, yeah, fuck this price action. "
"3780950","3784730"," I got protect to the downside of my biases to the upside."
"3786090","3787250"," We'll just wait and see."
"3789330","3792810"," Unless I guess I guess the way I get fucked here is if they just trade this. "
"3793030","3795150"," I guess I get fucked here if they do this bullshit."
"3795870","3796710"," All day long."
"3796790","3799590"," We just ride this into four p.m. and don't do a goddamn thing. "
"3800350","3802130"," I guess if that happens, I'm fucked."
"3803030","3805230"," But otherwise pick a direction pick a lane spy."
"3806550","3807990"," Pick a fucking lane. "
"3820400","3821640"," There's a note for you."
"3821880","3826520"," I've got a doctor's appointment today at after be there at two thirty, which means I got to show up"
"3826520","3826920"," at like two."
"3827580","3829960"," And I got to get ready to go there and drive there. "
"3830100","3830500"," Blah, blah, blah."
"3831180","3833020"," So I ran around twelve, thirty."
"3833720","3835360"," I'm going to end up leaving the stream. "
"3835440","3836960"," I'll leave you guys on the stream alone."
"3838000","3841180"," So it's eleven, sixteen, eighteen right now."
"3841380","3842700"," So I've got another hour with you. "
"3844000","3845600"," I've got another hour with you."
"3845640","3848280"," So we're going to talk about what to expect into tomorrow."
"3848800","3854160"," I'll leave the stream up until four p.m. Today, but we're going to talk in the next, for the"
"3854160","3859180"," next hour, we're going to talk about what to expect into Friday and then next week. "
"3859400","3863120"," So we're going to give a quick market update into what to expect into the weekend."
"3863920","3866100"," So you're going to get your, you got your gamma profile from me."
"3866160","3867080"," You know where the gamma is. "
"3867240","3870360"," The put wall is at forty two hundred on SPX."
"3870740","3872580"," So pretty close to where that put wall is."
"3872860","3877680"," You need a reason for the put wall to be extended to the downside. "
"3877680","3883180"," In the beginning of the quarter, on the first of September, the market was not edged."
"3884180","3886740"," But hedging has come on the market since then."
"3887700","3891960"," So we do have hedging down to forty two hundred. "
"3891980","3896620"," Then there's a bunch of puts at four one zero zero."
"3897060","3900940"," And then there's a whole, another rack of puts down at four thousand."
"3901180","3905280"," A major hedge down at four thousand on SPY. "
"3905280","3908360"," So the put wall right now is at four twenty."
"3909320","3911060"," But we can break through that."
"3911200","3911660"," That's the key. "
"3911860","3914760"," Like if we trade four two zero zero, not four twenty forty two hundred."
"3915100","3921280"," If we trade forty two hundred on SPX and blast through that, there's nothing saying we can't trade"
"3921280","3926120"," that for ten or four one zero zero or that four zero zero zero below."
"3926720","3935820"," We also know that from the upside, we've got the daily trigger racing to the downside on SPY. "
"3936000","3945440"," So if we look at this on a thirty, if we look at this on a thirty minute basis, you"
"3945440","3947740"," can see it's still racing down, right?"
"3948420","3952280"," You see this, this daily trigger is near vertical to the downside."
"3953060","3954300"," And it's an ominous warning."
"3954640","3956760"," And this is not something to be trifled with. "
"3957920","3961760"," In any way, shape or form, you end up coming down here."
"3961900","3968260"," And if you get this cross off of that weekly trigger, do you get that cross in rejection?"
"3969220","3972720"," It does not bode well for the stock stock market."
"3973380","3981120"," So what ends up happening is you're expecting this squeeze higher, this rejection down, right?"
"3981480","3983380"," Or trade it up from here, right?"
"3984280","3987680"," But you're seeing a suppression of price today. "
"3988540","3989140"," Do you see that?"
"3989340","3991180"," I want you to watch this closely."
"3991640","3993400"," You're seeing suppression of price here."
"3994580","3995620"," All right. "
"3995780","3997400"," Price is being suppressed, right?"
"3997620","4000920"," They've been turned around, pinned to the downside, right?"
"4001780","4003920"," Waiting for this daily trigger to come down."
"4004660","4005880"," And it's ominous."
"4006260","4007640"," It doesn't look good here. "
"4008180","4008740"," I'll be honest."
"4009000","4010300"," This does not look good."
"4010520","4017940"," If price was coming up, if price was able to get up here, at least attack this and attack this,"
"4018760","4020540"," I'd feel a little bit better, right?"
"4020540","4023840"," But when that's not happening and you're saying, nope, we're going to reverse. "
"4024480","4027800"," We're going to pin this shit until the cross happens."
"4028520","4029800"," It's not a good look."
"4030260","4036380"," This is not holding this down until this stuff gets down here is kind of like asking for. "
"4037040","4042180"," It's basically asking for a bloodbath, setting up a bloodbath to the downside."
"4043100","4047940"," That's where you start getting waterfall selling, waterfall puts, all that kind of stuff comes into"
"4047940","4048400"," play here."
"4048400","4058020"," So some concern, most definitely some concern into Friday's news, of course, but even so,"
"4058280","4061460"," even so with that concern. "
"4061840","4062860"," I was going to put this on a one minute here."
"4066980","4068400"," Move that out of the way."
"4068800","4069580"," See that?"
"4071840","4077720"," A little bit of this and this. "
"4087570","4089870"," I was going to sell my puts, but I'm not going to leave them on."
"4091590","4092710"," I'll put stay on."
"4095470","4098050"," Let's see a look at the main weebel. "
"4099029","4100029"," Let's see, look at this one right here."
"4103540","4104819"," Right up in here."
"4105779","4110520"," We've followed trend, the expectation to the downside, not the expectation to the upside. "
"4110520","4114880"," So I'm trying to sell this immediately on the half hour trigger up here."
"4115340","4118319"," You can see that sell on the half hour trigger."
"4119100","4122479"," And there's some expectation of that downside target in Friday. "
"4123080","4132979"," So until we regain the hourly trigger, until we regain the hourly trigger, sellers"
"4132979","4134359"," are in charge here, right?"
"4135180","4137160"," So there we see."
"4138640","4143760"," So until the hourly trigger is regained, you see where my calls are, they're down here."
"4144779","4146100"," You can see all that down there. "
"4146220","4147040"," That's where my calls are."
"4147240","4148760"," I've got call spreads down here."
"4149580","4152540"," So as long as we maintain this to the upside, I'm good to go. "
"4152899","4155580"," But we start breaking this plane down here."
"4156040","4159279"," It starts scooting down here, trying to target that into Friday."
"4160680","4161920"," And I get stopped out, right?"
"4162340","4163479"," I get stopped out of call spreads. "
"4165020","4166720"," Squeezing right now to the upside."
"4170140","4173979"," Need to see nice fat squeeze right now."
"4174120","4175819"," Gorgeous squeeze on spoos. "
"4177640","4187720"," Trading 38 on 4.24, 12 cents on 4.19. To"
"4187720","4191460"," regain that hourly trigger up here, this is a key level right here, this HT."
"4192580","4193640"," Move that over."
"4194980","4197140"," Key level right here for bullishness. "
"4197300","4199760"," Until you're above that HT, no bullishness."
"4200420","4202740"," This is going to be used for selling to the downside."
"4206560","4208100"," So I need to see this. "
"4208280","4214800"," Without seeing this hourly trigger, without seeing this hourly trigger, do not believe the bull."
"4214920","4217600"," I mean, I'm bullish here, but do not believe that bullishness here."
"4217680","4219200"," This is just another sounding board. "
"4219200","4222360"," A pin of the market to sell us down to the depths of hell."
"4225600","4227020"," So just look at this here."
"4232260","4236020"," On a higher time frame without being into the microscope. "
"4237580","4239040"," It's just that right there."
"4239460","4240820"," It's all that is to the downside."
"4241780","4243240"," Need price to get above this. "
"4244500","4251080"," Hold that hourly trigger so we can trade that weekly trigger right here and the daily trigger above"
"4251080","4252680"," it, which is right over here."
"4253880","4263820"," As a matter of fact, that daily trigger is 29.45. Hold"
"4263820","4264360"," on a second here."
"4269160","4270360"," That's the weekly. "
"4274570","4285220"," 35.07. Right up,"
"4285420","4286280"," right up there."
"4289500","4294140"," Until you get above this to attack that."
"4295840","4299500"," Or even if there's a pullback there and then attack that. "
"4304470","4309970"," When I leave at 12.30, just be aware of this resistance here."
"4310130","4315290"," Be aware of this hourly trigger now being used as a springboard to the downside."
"4317630","4319630"," With the price started down below. "
"4321770","4324790"," Four thirteen four sixteen eighty four."
"4325770","4328110"," Four sixteen eighty four and then four."
"4330430","4334310"," Four thirteen fourteen into Friday if you get bad news tomorrow. "
"4343120","4346760"," Still long calls long puts haven't changed anything as of yet."
"4347440","4349240"," Just sitting here and waiting at."
"4351160","4356320"," Twenty five four twenty four C's and I got ten four nineteen P's. "
"4367320","4370340"," Inverse head and shoulders on the intraday chart for spy."
"4375180","4379240"," The yellow box down below this is where my calls are down here if you want to know."
"4379240","4387880"," I got calls down here for December 29th for market breath indicator stuff. "
"4388440","4390280"," It's kind of where I make my money in the market."
"4391800","4396600"," Always call spreads on oversold on market breath."
"4397880","4398840"," Look at that. "
"4399020","4400640"," Look at this big fucking bars up here."
"4400760","4401720"," Look at this shit up here."
"4402600","4403280"," Look at that. "
"4403820","4405880"," Look at this selling pressure right there."
"4405880","4406360"," Look at that."
"4406440","4407160"," Look at this right here. "
"4407280","4409020"," You shall not pass up in here."
"4409720","4411160"," And you got this one right here."
"4411260","4412300"," Look at these guys up here. "
"4413040","4414760"," Just fuck you were out."
"4415360","4416000"," Look at that."
"4416740","4417700"," God damn. "
"4426980","4428680"," Show that there in a better light."
"4437720","4438860"," Does that work up there?"
"4440080","4440960"," See if I can."
"4445380","4446700"," Some weird going on. "
"4450100","4452020"," Activate and deactivate that."
"4453860","4455880"," No, no, I don't want to do that."
"4462110","4463870"," Just brutal right now. "
"4466330","4469590"," Nothing has happened since 1042."
"4470130","4477270"," It's not eleven twenty nine full hour of just parked right here like no movement right here."
"4478170","4479970"," One full hour. "
"4480230","4483430"," So right here is eleven thirty."
"4483670","4485250"," This is eleven thirty."
"4486030","4488190"," This is eleven thirty. "
"4488550","4488970"," No movement."
"4489550","4490530"," Just parked right here."
"4495870","4500190"," And just parked on that resistance level on gamma. "
"4512970","4515990"," Yeah, I've got a Juneberry just said a hedge with a call."
"4516210","4519590"," So I've got I've got ten puts and I got twenty five calls here."
"4520750","4522430"," I'll pay for the calls if they burn. "
"4531340","4533320"," I have this feeling I'm going to hold them into."
"4533620","4538040"," I have a pretty good feeling here that I'm going to be holding these fucking things right to four."
"4539340","4540340"," Which I don't want to do. "
"4540620","4542680"," I just don't know if you know this or not."
"4542680","4546400"," But I try not to trade while I'm traveling."
"4548920","4551200"," Oftentimes, you know, so what happens when I'm traveling is this. "
"4551280","4552240"," We're going to tell you what happens when I travel."
"4553260","4557160"," So like if I go somewhere, if I'm like driving and I'm in a trade like a day trade or"
"4557160","4557740"," a weekly trade."
"4559300","4564480"," I'll drive somewhere and I'll open my phone and I'm like, oh, I'm up. "
"4565680","4567680"," Like look at how smart I am."
"4567680","4571760"," So usually I'm up like a pretty good like hundred percent two hundred percent."
"4572540","4578160"," I'll close that trade like in a grocery store or in my car. "
"4579140","4581160"," I'll close the trade and take the money."
"4583340","4584380"," Like driving."
"4585160","4588580"," And I'm like, oh, dude, I'm so smart. "
"4589160","4593060"," Let's put another trade on while I'm driving with my phone in my hand."
"4593720","4594800"," So I'll put the trade on."
"4595200","4597660"," I'll close my phone or whatever, go back to doing what I was doing. "
"4597900","4599060"," Come back two hours later."
"4600300","4602220"," And I'm like, oh shit, that burned to the ground."
"4602880","4603780"," I guess I'm not that smart. "
"4604180","4606900"," I thought I was smart, but it's more that I wasn't paying attention."
"4608220","4614880"," So I'm guessing here that by guessing that today I'm going to have to be long end short into the"
"4614880","4615120"," close."
"4616140","4617960"," And we're going to make a move up or down. "
"4617960","4624500"," I guess I lose if we if we just pin right here and S1 until four fucking PM, but."
"4626680","4629180"," Sorry, I've been sitting here doing not a goddamn thing."
"4629200","4630580"," So I'm just going to leave them on now. "
"4630760","4631520"," Let me fuck them."
"4632780","4634500"," Let them decide where we're going."
"4636720","4638320"," But I'm fascinated. "
"4638740","4643880"," I guess one of the reason I'm saying this is because today when I'm getting out of the doctor's"
"4643880","4644340"," office."
"4645100","4647320"," I have to open up my fucking phone and be like."
"4648460","4650000"," Is both sides towards stores. "
"4650280","4651880"," One side fucking green is fuck."
"4652720","4654960"," Or, you know, like, you know what I mean?"
"4655100","4656240"," Like, what's what's going to happen?"
"4657200","4659120"," I'm assuming that I'm going to it's going to be green."
"4665100","4666660"," Yeah, I got both sides right now. "
"4667040","4670380"," Well, I guess the reason I got both sides, Jimmy, is because I bought fucking calls."
"4671240","4672900"," It's got me by two pennies."
"4673480","4678000"," Well, they got well, I got stopped on the one penny, but went down another penny and I'm like"
"4678000","4678720"," motherfucker. "
"4678820","4680580"," And then I would trade it back up like 36 cents."
"4681320","4682220"," So I'm like, all right, fuck it."
"4682280","4686740"," We'll throw a bunch of calls on a bunch of puts on and we'll just wait for them to make"
"4686740","4687100"," a decision. "
"4690620","4692140"," Yeah, send us the depths of hell."
"4693060","4694220"," It looks like they are."
"4694700","4696200"," It doesn't look good here. "
"4696460","4698900"," So it's not looking good."
"4701280","4708260"," The pin reminds me of whenever they pin the market intentionally and get that momentum down on top"
"4708260","4709520"," of you without you watching."
"4709520","4714280"," Normally you see a squeeze and we'll start breaking above that daily trigger. "
"4714600","4716120"," But they're not allowed."
"4722600","4724920"," It looks looks pretty bearish to me."
"4725100","4727740"," So my bearish alarm bells are going off. "
"4732710","4734630"," My bear bells are going off."
"4734810","4740070"," I can hear the bears in the in the in the in the meadows."
"4741730","4743810"," Like the sunny meadows of the mountainside. "
"4765650","4766430"," Holy shit."
"4766490","4767090"," I'm looking at that."
"4767850","4769730"," That big yellow line coming down. "
"4770110","4772130"," The thing is fucking not looking pretty."
"4773070","4774750"," We got a squeeze, baby."
"4775950","4780350"," We gots to squeeze the sounds of bears slapping fish. "
"4783650","4785770"," To release the uncooked numbers."
"4790270","4791910"," It's super too funny."
"4793030","4793630"," Did you see that?"
"4793810","4795110"," Did you see that post they put on?"
"4795270","4796090"," I saw it on Reddit. "
"4796990","4800010"," The one where they showed the interest rates people are paying right now."
"4801850","4803350"," And that ain't nothing."
"4803550","4808810"," Jamie Diamon saying they're dimming Jamie Diamon saying we'll go to seven basis points. "
"4808810","4812570"," That would put rates at 10 or 11."
"4812570","4813510"," I think maybe 12."
"4813950","4816570"," Then you're all said and done on mortgages. "
"4821760","4828810"," Oh, yeah, they're cooking the employment numbers."
"4828990","4831590"," Did you see the I saw the other the jobs numbers?"
"4831590","4833170"," I was like, this is bullshit."
"4839110","4841510"," The numbers this morning were totally fucking cooked. "
"4842370","4843510"," Totally fucking cooked."
"4844950","4849590"," You guys know the numbers this morning are basically saying they're doing the job, right?"
"4851050","4852310"," The Fed is doing the job."
"4852450","4854930"," They likely don't have to raise rates because of those numbers. "
"4859440","4860460"," Yeah, I don't know."
"4860600","4863800"," I want to tell you something about the used car mark or the car market."
"4864820","4865520"," It's a good. "
"4865680","4866200"," It's a good point."
"4866480","4868660"," So someone just posted what I just see."
"4870560","4874840"," Bad credit people paying 18% for used cars right now. "
"4876400","4879320"," There's a fascinating thing about I don't know if I said this yesterday."
"4879920","4885300"," I discussed it with some other people, but I think show don't and I have talked about this a ton."
"4888180","4889780"," Use car markets fascinating. "
"4890780","4894640"," You'll squeeze and again get an inverse head and shoulders trying to squeeze to the upside."
"4895400","4901400"," So when we come into these end of debts, the end of debt cycles."
"4903740","4906920"," There's some fascinating mechanics that that come into play. "
"4907940","4911880"," Number one car companies."
"4913080","4922740"," What they'll do is when we're in a growth phase in the economy, it's unmarried, right?"
"4923020","4928960"," If I were to go and buy a car with credit, I can buy one car."
"4930000","4937340"," If I'm married, we can buy two cars and it's easy for me to get loans for two cars. "
"4937860","4945940"," When I try to buy a third car truck, whatever with credit, it's not an easy thing to do to"
"4945940","4947640"," get that credit to get that third vehicle."
"4948200","4950500"," I have to show a need for it, right?"
"4951220","4951660"," I got up."
"4952460","4953300"," My name is Mary. "
"4953500","4954900"," I got a land escaping business."
"4954900","4957180"," I need an extra truck, something like that."
"4959560","4960640"," You can get an approval. "
"4961880","4962500"," It's not easy."
"4962880","4963940"," It's not that you can't."
"4964000","4964500"," It's not easy. "
"4966000","4967460"," And you've got good credit."
"4967660","4968140"," You've got a job."
"4968280","4968820"," Everything looks great. "
"4968860","4969880"," Everything is awesome, right?"
"4970060","4970820"," Everything is awesome."
"4971340","4972020"," Everything is awesome."
"4972300","4972360"," Yeah. "
"4974440","4983460"," But when we come into these cycles where we are right now, automakers know that the end of a short "
"4983460","4987000","-term or long-term debt cycle and they know a couple things."
"4987780","4994020"," They know that if you own a home, if you're married, this could be Mary, right?"
"4994020","4994440"," It's going to be a woman."
"4994560","4995200"," It doesn't matter who it is. "
"4995720","5002880"," So let's say you're Mary or I'm Mary and then my husband is the stay-at-home dad and I'm"
"5002880","5003620"," Mary, right?"
"5004320","5005580"," And I'm going to lose my house."
"5005960","5006620"," They're aware of that."
"5006800","5007660"," They know that's happening. "
"5008120","5010000"," But they know something else."
"5010380","5014080"," They know that Mary is willing to lose her husband."
"5015480","5018960"," She's willing to lose the kids and the dogs and the cats and all this other stuff. "
"5019240","5023560"," But what Mary is unwilling to lose is her ability to make money."
"5023560","5025980"," So she's got pretty much two directives."
"5026720","5028220"," Keep your job, right?"
"5028900","5030580"," And then she's got this other directive. "
"5031300","5033620"," If I can't keep my job, I'm going to get two jobs."
"5033780","5035720"," If I can't keep those two jobs, I'll take three jobs."
"5035920","5038340"," No matter what, I have to keep working, right?"
"5038800","5040280"," So Mary is like a breadwinner. "
"5040880","5044820"," Mary is taking care of a husband, a couple of kids, couple of dogs, couple of cats."
"5046120","5049100"," Some, I don't know, chickens and horses and just got a big house."
"5049340","5051300"," She's got, I don't know, 2.5 kids. "
"5051980","5053940"," She's got white pick fence house."
"5053940","5054960"," She lives in a nice neighborhood."
"5055580","5058340"," It's not, it's got an HOA, but it's not bad HOA. "
"5061680","5063160"," But she knows she has to work."
"5063380","5069500"," She knows no matter what happens, whether her marriage breaks up or she loses her house, she's"
"5069500","5072900"," going to have to pay child support to her ship bag husband, right?"
"5074380","5077160"," And she has to pay for kids to raise her kids."
"5077720","5079420"," And she knows she has to keep her job no matter what. "
"5079420","5081780"," It's like number one is keep your job."
"5082040","5085020"," Number two, if you don't keep your job, work anywhere."
"5085860","5091040"," Oftentimes, you'll hear us talk in this program about how when you go out to eat dinner in a nice"
"5091040","5091980"," restaurant, right?"
"5092780","5094680"," Nice place, like go to a nice restaurant. "
"5095000","5100040"," You'll notice that service wanes when the economy is great."
"5100940","5103960"," And then service improves when the economy is bad."
"5104960","5106460"," This is when the economy is bad. "
"5107700","5110460"," People in high paying jobs are getting laid off."
"5111600","5117020"," And so they have to take jobs as a wait staff or bartenders."
"5117780","5120080"," And so you'll find people working, you'll ask your server. "
"5120440","5122860"," Say, hey, this is what you do for a career."
"5123080","5127760"," If they say to you, yes, that's like someone that's like in the service industry."
"5128080","5132520"," If you start to hear people saying, no, I'm normally a realtor or no, I'm normally this. "
"5133040","5135960"," No, I'm normally that start to hear those kind of things."
"5136240","5137400"," You know, the economy is bad."
"5138640","5142080"," But these people, they, no matter what, right, they have to work. "
"5142420","5143900"," It's like work is number one is the point."
"5144600","5145760"," But number two is not your home."
"5145960","5148800"," You think it would be your home or your marriage. "
"5150380","5157760"," Not that breadwinner Mary in this case knows that her number one job is to buy or excuse me to"
"5157760","5158020"," work."
"5158020","5164720"," And our number two responsibility is to get there, keep a vehicle."
"5165860","5173420"," And what we see happening, we see how we see happening in the past is you're only eligible for two"
"5173420","5174600"," cars being married, right?"
"5174960","5182140"," Well, right now car makers will allow you to buy a third car knowing that you're going to default"
"5182140","5185720"," on your previous car loans, right?"
"5185720","5187020"," Listen, it's close. "
"5187200","5188500"," So I've got two cars now."
"5188780","5189340"," I'm Mary."
"5189760","5194360"," I pay for my big, bad truck and my husband's geo tracker. "
"5197420","5199700"," And I know I'm going to lose my home."
"5200480","5201740"," I just lost my job."
"5201960","5203520"," So I'm not working at a restaurant. "
"5204540","5209360"," I'm looking at my husband at home and I'm like, that shit bag is going to definitely be up beyond"
"5209360","5210180"," his ass, right?"
"5210500","5211820"," I'm going to lose my house now."
"5212720","5214820"," And I'm probably going to lose my car loans."
"5215380","5217720"," And my car loans are upside down. "
"5217720","5219340"," I've been paying on them for two, three years."
"5220300","5224300"," They're not worth what I'm paying and loan the note that I'm stuck in."
"5224380","5225700"," My husband, he doesn't work. "
"5225720","5227980"," So I'm just paying off his shit."
"5227980","5230380"," I know I'm going to lose my two vehicles to repossession."
"5231100","5233180"," So what does what does that Mary do?"
"5233740","5241380"," Mary goes to buy a third car before her credit is ruined, where she loses her home, where she loses"
"5241380","5242300"," her other two vehicles. "
"5242960","5249300"," She goes out there and she goes down to the car lot and she's like, hey, I'm paying $800 a"
"5249300","5251500"," month on this on this truck that I have."
"5251500","5256860"," And I'm paying another 500 or 350 for this shitbox geo tracker."
"5257340","5258240"," They called us geo tracker. "
"5258480","5258980"," I don't remember."
"5261300","5262980"," Where my shit bag husband at home."
"5263600","5267760"," And I want to buy a new vehicle. "
"5267760","5272740"," Well, do you want to trade those in and roll those loans into that new vehicle?"
"5273500","5274720"," Fuck no, Mary says."
"5275800","5278160"," Fuck no, I want a third vehicle, right?"
"5278360","5284060"," Because Mary already knows that she can probably get a car loan she can afford."
"5284900","5290680"," And if she leaves the other two loans on and let those goes go bad, it's not going to impact"
"5290680","5290980"," her. "
"5291080","5292480"," She'll still be able to get to work."
"5293380","5295680"," So they eventually, she gets the third car loan."
"5295680","5296700"," That's the key point here. "
"5297080","5302960"," At the end of these cycles, the dealers know this is going on."
"5303700","5305960"," So what they do is they give the third car loan to Mary."
"5306900","5308380"," And so now she's got a car she can afford. "
"5309560","5312940"," And then she of course has the two other vehicles repossessed."
"5313600","5314880"," The house gets taken away."
"5315980","5318680"," Her shit bag husband at home is all upset now. "
"5319000","5321380"," They start fighting and they get a divorce."
"5321380","5322680"," It was the house that was the cars."
"5323140","5330660"," Mary, though, is like sweating bullets and she knows that she at least has a vehicle that she can"
"5330660","5331540"," work with, right?"
"5332120","5337660"," The payment is now more affordable, even if she's paying a high rate of 18%. "
"5337660","5341080"," So she picked up this used ship box, but she's paying 18%."
"5341080","5347880"," But her monthly payment is not is no longer that 800 plus that 500 that she was paying."
"5347880","5351220"," She's probably paying like 150, 200, 300. "
"5351920","5355020"," It's more reasonable and it helps her to get to work."
"5355300","5358160"," Now, what happens to those banks that are making those payments?"
"5359340","5364680"," We have some examples in the past of them failing and the automakers not caring."
"5366080","5369220"," Those small regional banks collapsing and stuff. "
"5369540","5374000"," But generally speaking, she's likely going to pay off that third vehicle."
"5374620","5375520"," She can afford it now."
"5375520","5380960"," All she has to do is keep working and she can afford that third vehicle and allow those other two"
"5380960","5383720"," to get repossessed. "
"5384160","5385660"," Now, what does that all mean, right?"
"5386680","5394780"," Means that you should see the used car market pricing hold or go up."
"5395340","5396000"," Does that make sense?"
"5396880","5400540"," So you should see the used car market actually have lots of demand."
"5401480","5408280"," You should also see these people losing their homes, right?"
"5408480","5409440"," Are they losing their homes yet?"
"5410040","5410940"," Are they losing their jobs?"
"5411440","5413020"," And that's the data that we're looking for, right?"
"5413180","5417600"," Looking for the data that they're losing their jobs or losing their houses and the used car market"
"5417600","5418640"," is holding up. "
"5418820","5423560"," So I'm not surprised to see people wanting to pay 18%."
"5423560","5430160"," I guess for right now, at least I'm not surprised with people trying to pay 18% on a used"
"5430160","5430480"," car."
"5430480","5439240"," It would make financial sense even though you're being taken advantage of"
"5439240","5443060"," with that 18% rate on that used car. "
"5443660","5445960"," But these people know this is happening is my point."
"5446740","5448060"," They know that it's happening."
"5448200","5453720"," They're going to nail these people on those loans on those used cars so they can get by and move"
"5453720","5454120"," forward. "
"5459100","5461940"," Yeah, she's going to have one car."
"5463620","5465500"," Her husband's going to take her for a ride."
"5467240","5469200"," He's going to take everything she owns. "
"5470880","5471740"," They're going to lose everything."
"5471960","5472320"," Good divorce."
"5472800","5474040"," She doesn't even get the goddamn dog. "
"5476520","5480960"," The husband gets the kids, the dog, the cats, the horses."
"5480960","5483080"," Well, they'll probably lose the horses and the divorce."
"5487960","5491500"," Yeah, transportation is essential and the dealers know it. "
"5492100","5493440"," The loan makers know it."
"5493620","5496900"," What's fascinating is they know that they shouldn't be giving these loans to people."
"5497580","5499940"," But they know they're likely going to pay these loans off. "
"5500240","5501680"," They already know they're going to lose the other ones."
"5502280","5505800"," It's like these car makers know that they're already fucked on the other two cars."
"5506580","5506980"," Right?"
"5507200","5508340"," Like we sold them two cars. "
"5508480","5513420"," We know that they're going to be repossessed and then put into the used car market."
"5514180","5514580"," Right?"
"5516900","5518340"," And so you're looking for that."
"5518440","5519660"," You're actually looking for you. "
"5519700","5524060"," You want to see the 18% used car loan market booming."
"5525140","5530080"," And you want to see jobs numbers come in lower, which they are, right?"
"5530200","5531500"," We had some jobs numbers come out."
"5531640","5532880"," Just come out that were lower. "
"5533440","5535380"," You want to see unemployment numbers rising."
"5536520","5538800"," And you want to see, what else you want to see?"
"5538920","5543240"," You want to see some defaulting on home loans, right?"
"5543380","5544640"," We haven't seen that quite yet."
"5545540","5546760"," The defaulting on home loans. "
"5547060","5552980"," And even the post that I made on Twitter yesterday, I made a post yesterday on Twitter, but I found"
"5552980","5559600"," on Reddit that was showing the potential interest rates that you would pay over 30 years."
"5559600","5561600"," It was kind of a shitpost more than anything."
"5561600","5562900"," It doesn't really mean much. "
"5564080","5565520"," You repackage your loans."
"5565520","5573300"," If you refinance your loans, if you sell and scale up, it ain't going to mean you're paying $700 "
"5573300","5579080",",000 on a $300,000 loan for the entire life of that note."
"5579340","5582760"," And you'd likely not be in that note for the rest of the full 30 years. "
"5584420","5594800"," But still, that's really that thing that I posted yesterday, still"
"5594800","5595860"," really doesn't mean anything."
"5596860","5605060"," It doesn't mean anything because, number one, the number of people that are buying houses with"
"5605060","5608200"," traditional mortgages is low."
"5610220","5618500"," The people that we want out of the housing market have not declared bankruptcy yet, or have been"
"5618500","5619600"," foreclosed on yet. "
"5620720","5623000"," And they're trying to ride this out, right?"
"5623260","5626980"," So you've got like, I mean, it seems really bad, right?"
"5627300","5633160"," You might, you might, you might be the one voice out there that's like, well, I can't afford, I"
"5633160","5636560"," can't afford the interest rates on buying a new home."
"5639040","5641380"," As a matter of fact, I got a funny story for you."
"5641580","5649500"," My sister-in-law, my sister-in-law and her husband just bought a second vacation home. "
"5650720","5655500"," I closed down it last week with interest rates, high interest rates didn't matter."
"5656500","5657220"," And they don't care."
"5657880","5659580"," And they work in tech, or she doesn't, but he doesn't. "
"5659580","5662320"," He works in tech and she works in education system."
"5662660","5663680"," But it's about a second house."
"5664520","5665800"," And they're not feeling the pain. "
"5666820","5668580"," They're not, he's not laid off."
"5668860","5669900"," She's not laid off."
"5671480","5673500"," She's not, they're not feeling the pain. "
"5673640","5674400"," They don't even care about it."
"5674660","5678560"," Some of you can't afford these high rates, but some people still can."
"5678740","5680260"," They're not getting laid off yet. "
"5680900","5682060"," And they haven't declared bankruptcy."
"5682320","5686900"," The people that actually own homes or can own homes are still buying homes, even with higher rates,"
"5686900","5687300"," my point."
"5688100","5692720"," So you've got, you've got a small percentage of the population that want to buy that can't afford"
"5692720","5692960"," it. "
"5693580","5695260"," This is a small group, right?"
"5695980","5698300"," You've got the, the haves that can't afford it."
"5699060","5705620"," And then you've got this whole other class of people that bought prior to two years ago."
"5706320","5709480"," The vast majority of homeowners are not new homeowners. "
"5710120","5715260"," And what's fascinating is if you look at, if you look at the average number of years that someone"
"5715260","5718320"," owns a home, there's like two major milestones."
"5718320","5723440"," I can't recall this off time, but I think it's three years, three to five, and then eight to ten,"
"5723480","5724880"," I think, for seven to ten."
"5726560","5729940"," All those people that should be selling at the three-year mark have not. "
"5730540","5734640"," All the people that should be selling at the eight-year mark are coming into their, like, they were"
"5734640","5735980"," like seven years last year."
"5736100","5738320"," The average, they're now like eight, nine, ten."
"5738460","5740900"," They're falling into owning longer than the average. "
"5741400","5745600"," The average three to four, five-year homeowner is starting to come up to that five-year mark right"
"5745600","5745840"," now."
"5745840","5748280"," So these people are not selling as my point."
"5748640","5753000"," The majority of homeowners are still trying to wait out the market. "
"5753300","5755920"," So we're not there yet in my view."
"5756180","5757300"," We're not quite there."
"5757940","5760660"," We will be there, but we're not there just yet. "
"5761160","5763580"," So there are still people buying houses with those high rates."
"5764360","5769580"," There are still people not, or haven't been forced out of their homes, and the jobs market is"
"5769580","5770280"," really it."
"5770280","5777100"," The jobs market, the unemployment market, the jobs that are on offer, and the unemployment figures,"
"5777100","5778100"," both of those. "
"5778420","5783660"," How many jobs are available, and how many people have been given the shit can?"
"5785040","5785700"," We're there."
"5788040","5789660"," We talked about this before."
"5789860","5793300"," We talked about how we're like, hey, we're going to talk about inflation. "
"5793300","5800400"," We're going to talk about the interest rates."
"5800420","5802600"," We're going to talk about the unemployment rates."
"5802740","5804120"," We're going to talk about the jobs numbers. "
"5804120","5806780"," We're going to talk about the inverted yield curve."
"5806800","5809640"," We're going to talk about, I don't know, all this other crap, right?"
"5810740","5817800"," That tells you all this macro data that tells you when the market's going to roll over, and we're"
"5817800","5826340"," back to the original conversation, which is that the least reliable answer as to whether the stock"
"5826340","5830280"," market goes up or down is likely the yield curve, believe it or not."
"5830420","5836600"," You can't historically use the yield curve as the basis for whether the market goes up and down. "
"5837220","5845160"," What you can rely upon at the end of the day when it's all said and done is always the"
"5845160","5847300"," unemployment rate and the jobs numbers."
"5847300","5848900"," It's always those two."
"5849620","5853260"," It always comes down to do they have a fucking job?"
"5853820","5855580"," I don't care what the job is. "
"5855580","5857020"," Do they have the goddamn job?"
"5857320","5858120"," Do they have two jobs?"
"5858440","5858960"," They have three jobs?"
"5859180","5859520"," Are they working?"
"5860300","5861280"," Are they making money?"
"5861980","5862240"," That's right."
"5862500","5863740"," So we're looking at the car loans."
"5864100","5865140"," We're looking at the mortgages. "
"5865980","5873840"," I want to see the foreclosures, but really when it comes down to brass tax is are they working or"
"5873840","5874300"," not?"
"5874300","5882260"," Or have they been reduced to going from a high six figure income or a $100,000 to $300,000"
"5882260","5882820"," income?"
"5883360","5888800"," Have they been slammed down to like that $50,000 less than $100,000 income?"
"5889900","5891180"," We haven't seen that yet."
"5891500","5891780"," We are."
"5892000","5899780"," We saw some good numbers come out this morning pointing towards that, but truthfully, we want Mary"
"5899780","5902480"," to get kicked in the teeth. "
"5903860","5906880"," Figuratively not, you know, she's the breadwinner."
"5907060","5908160"," We want her to get kicked in the teeth."
"5908520","5909140"," And how do you get?"
"5909460","5909840"," She's not. "
"5910060","5911640"," We need her to lose a goddamn job, right?"
"5911860","5913560"," We need Mary to like get fired."
"5914660","5917000"," Panic and not have the money to pay for that house."
"5917320","5919680"," Not have the money to pay for the two cars. "
"5920060","5924940"," Not have the money to pay for ship bag husband at home and all the goddamn dogs and the horse"
"5924940","5929300"," and the 2.5 kids and the white pick offense to home up in the hills."
"5930940","5933420"," Still not seeing that at the moment."
"5934520","5938820"," See, well, seeing some seeing the fudge numbers that Jimmy Barry was talking about. "
"5939400","5942260"," That they're making progress on job opportunities."
"5942440","5946460"," Now we're waiting on that unemployment opportunities and all that kind of stuff."
"5949660","5950980"," Mary's selling his calls now. "
"5958000","5960100"," Yeah, so we need that destruction, man."
"5960480","5961960"," Till that destruction happens."
"5962920","5963720"," I don't know. "
"5966020","5967600"," I don't know what to say."
"5967860","5969920"," We need that job destruction."
"5971100","5972500"," It's so terrible to say that. "
"5974180","5978000"," I feel like I feel like such an asshole like they don't want to tell you that, but it's what"
"5978000","5978380"," they need."
"5980740","5986340"," They say like wrote like what does Jerome say says my mandate is."
"5989600","5993500"," Something about protecting the jobs market, bringing inflation down. "
"5993980","5994960"," It's like, really?"
"5995720","5997520"," He need to fucking fire some people, man."
"5997640","5998640"," You want to bring inflation down."
"6001220","6003240"," People lose their goddamn jobs, bro. "
"6005360","6008280"," Squeeze an iron out trading four, twenty two, fifty six."
"6008760","6011760"," Trying to regain the hourly trigger to the upside here."
"6014760","6016380"," That's one holding so far. "
"6016540","6017100"," Squeezing higher."
"6024560","6030490"," Yeah, maximum employment, right?"
"6032350","6035010"," Stable prices, maximum employment, fucking liar."
"6035950","6037990"," You're such a fucking liar. "
"6038430","6040010"," Why can't you just tell them the truth?"
"6040870","6042750"," Just tell them you want mass unemployment."
"6044430","6046490"," Six percent unemployment, bro."
"6049170","6050170"," That's what you want. "
"6050370","6050890"," So let's be honest."
"6052370","6053410"," Six percent."
"6053570","6054310"," Let's try for eight. "
"6057430","6059310"," Yeah, restaurants are packed right now."
"6059550","6060670"," They're fucking packed, man."
"6061130","6062350"," People still have money. "
"6063410","6065230"," The damage is not done yet."
"6066030","6068110"," Now the Barry said this morning fudge numbers."
"6068370","6069730"," We got some fudge numbers this morning. "
"6071010","6072310"," We got some fudge numbers."
"6088720","6090380"," We need some bad numbers."
"6090600","6092180"," Well, let me ask you guys. "
"6092440","6094520"," Have any of you guys been laid off?"
"6095240","6105200"," Any of you experienced layoffs and no opportunity for a sideways"
"6105200","6108540"," or an upside move for you in an unemployment?"
"6114150","6120770"," Like if you've been laid off and let's say you're a staff engineer, were you able to get another"
"6120770","6122510"," staff engineer job or not?"
"6132960","6135680"," Let's see what you guys are writing here, missing someone you guys are writing."
"6136880","6140880"," Where I am, there are jobs out there people don't want to work."
"6141660","6143540"," I don't know how they can afford to not work. "
"6144440","6145480"," Government paying them."
"6145880","6147380"," I don't think there's any government payments."
"6148000","6150360"," I think most people that I know are working their balls off. "
"6153560","6155080"," Everyone I know is working."
"6155400","6157320"," I don't know anyone that's not working right now."
"6159720","6164320"," I'm trying to think of anyone that I know like friends or anything that aren't working. "
"6164660","6167640"," Everyone that I know is working one or multiple jobs."
"6173140","6177480"," Yeah, you're saying you lost $110,000 job a year."
"6178260","6180160"," I've been hiring laid off too old now. "
"6180620","6181760"," That's what we need too, right?"
"6182540","6185420"," We really need layoffs for older people."
"6185680","6192340"," We need those people that are like 40 to 60 years old to get laid off and then be on"
"6192340","6192600"," hire."
"6192600","6196920"," We'll hire a 20 year old for cheaper, which is horrible to say that too. "
"6197180","6198340"," I don't want that to happen."
"6198780","6203240"," But that is a function of our capitalist society."
"6206400","6207100"," You're retired. "
"6207320","6208260"," You fuck off all day mostly."
"6208840","6210160"," Hey, Billy, let me ask you a question."
"6210360","6214620"," Let me ask you a pointed question. "
"6214880","6222720"," Do you feel like there's also a mechanic in the background that tries to hurt you as well?"
"6224760","6230940"," So if you're retired and on a pension plan, they want to squeeze you down into something more"
"6230940","6232440"," affordable."
"6233320","6234260"," So let me ask you that."
"6234460","6240480"," Are you feel like if you went into retirement and felt like I got this?"
"6241420","6243100"," I've got this fully planned out. "
"6243580","6244660"," Nothing can hurt me."
"6245840","6250980"," Are you feeling any of that pressure from the Fed?"
"6250980","6254080"," Are you feeling like, ah, the inflation is getting me."
"6254340","6255440"," The gas is getting me. "
"6257340","6259300"," Rates are getting me or credit cards."
"6259320","6261120"," I got to tone down my debt."
"6262320","6267720"," Any of that stuff impacting you where you're scared or feel like you need to do anything else to"
"6267720","6271440"," fight or outpace the rate of inflation. "
"6276880","6280660"," This is directed to who wrote that."
"6281140","6282400"," I think it was Billy Ray."
"6284200","6285580"," Billy Ray from his comment. "
"6291950","6296010"," That laid off, did my job for the economy by taking the search, not seriously enjoying the summer."
"6296130","6296290"," Nice."
"6296450","6297350"," Good job, Dr. Gaughan. "
"6298530","6300350"," The ex-subscription is getting you."
"6301230","6303090"," And in pretty good shape, still in certain about the future."
"6305210","6312070"," I was thinking about that with, um, I was thinking about reason I'm asking you, Billy, is the"
"6312070","6316230"," reason I'm asking you specifically is because the friends that are in that conundrum right now. "
"6316910","6321050"," And then the second reason I'm asking you is for my own retirement."
"6321810","6327530"," I'm thinking about how I retire and where I retire."
"6331070","6337510"," And I don't know, when I was younger, when I was younger, I was like, ah, why did all these"
"6337510","6341130"," old people move to nice retirement places?"
"6341130","6344950"," They are not really nice, but like cheaper or affordable retirement areas. "
"6346730","6354030"," And recently I was thinking, well, when I retire, do I want to keep up with the Joneses and the"
"6354030","6358430"," rate of inflation with someone that's young?"
"6358710","6361410"," So I don't know how to word this better."
"6363610","6365950"," So I was like, well, I'll be more, more clear."
"6366390","6374790"," So I was looking at houses in Reno and Reno, California. "
"6374970","6379150"," And I was like, yeah, I can own a house here in Reno and it's booming and people love it."
"6379490","6381310"," And it's always going to, it's not always, but it's going to grow."
"6382590","6386850"," And these are a lot of people's first or second homes, but I have to keep up with these people"
"6386850","6388010"," and they're just starting their careers. "
"6388010","6389630"," Like, let's say they're 10 years into their career."
"6390430","6391070"," I'm trying to exit."
"6391470","6394890"," And so they're trying to, the rate of inflation keeps going higher over time. "
"6395070","6397710"," I'm like, ah, do I want to actually live there in my retirement or not?"
"6398990","6404010"," Would I rather find a home someplace that doesn't chase all of that stuff?"
"6405650","6406830"," Or do I leave the country?"
"6407270","6411110"," That's what the second, the second question for me was, do I, because my original plan was to leave"
"6411110","6419650"," the U.S. retire for our own homes in, like, you know, in Mexico and South America, maybe Asia and"
"6419650","6426770"," do some sailing, but you sold your Florida home for a good profit move."
"6426970","6427570"," Chattanooga, Tennessee."
"6428510","6428750"," Yeah. "
"6428790","6429650"," See, that's similar, right?"
"6430210","6430950"," You move to Chattanooga."
"6432830","6435410"," Downscaled D and grabbed a low mortgage rate, gave me a good buffer."
"6435590","6436110"," Yeah, that's good. "
"6436270","6436690"," I like that."
"6437010","6438510"," That's what I'm thinking of too."
"6440670","6449070"," Is I don't want to be in a place where I have to compete with inflation in, I say, 20,"
"6449210","6450110"," 30 years from now. "
"6455170","6460930"," Yeah, I'd open up D and D and, you know, I just read, did you read that story about, um,"
"6461590","6466930"," did you read that story about CNBC had a story about Dungeons and Dragons this morning?"
"6468570","6470870"," And I was like, dude, that makes such a cool bar."
"6470970","6472750"," They have a bar here in Detroit."
"6473210","6474970"," There's two bars, I believe. "
"6475930","6480230"," I think there's two bars that have their gaming bars."
"6481150","6483730"," It's like you go there and you can play board games or RPGs."
"6484350","6487390"," They've got food and booze and all that stuff. "
"6487710","6492670"," And I was reading that CNBC article this morning, and I was like, man, if they had like an RPG,"
"6492670","6495650"," they had an RPG, like, themed."
"6495650","6500490"," Like these two bars in Detroit, they're themed like that, kind of themed like that, but kind of"
"6500490","6500670"," not."
"6501110","6508510"," But this CNBC article was talking about like, uh, liquors and candles and all the stuff that's"
"6508510","6509690"," related towards Dungeons and Dragons. "
"6509930","6514870"," I was like, it'd be really cool to go to a, like a medieval, like medieval manor type place where"
"6514870","6521030"," they have like the, uh, they have like the, um, nights all fighting and the king and queen."
"6521310","6522970"," You eat the turkey leg and all that kind of stuff."
"6523570","6524570"," Not quite that. "
"6524570","6527150"," But like a cool ass local bar."
"6528430","6530450"," That's kind of themed towards like RPGs."
"6530910","6531670"," I think that'd be badass. "
"6532090","6532850"," It'd be fun as hell."
"6533350","6537070"," I'd love to go out with friends to a place like that and play any kind of, any kind of"
"6537070","6538070"," board game or whatever."
"6538610","6541990"," But it had like a theme, like it looked like a tavern or something. "
"6542210","6542950"," I think that would be a blast."
"6544010","6551630"," I felt like that article on CNBC this morning was geared towards a restaurant developer in Florida."
"6551630","6555050"," Like the Florida is like the hotbed for restaurant development. "
"6555870","6556890"," For like theme franchises."
"6557850","6561710"," I was like, man, like a D and D tavern tavern themed restaurant."
"6562310","6563030"," It'd be cool as fuck. "
"6563190","6563970"," Like kids would love it."
"6564350","6565130"," Families would love it."
"6565390","6566010"," Friends would love it. "
"6566690","6570010"," It'd be like an Applebee's for people today or something."
"6570370","6570810"," What do they call it?"
"6571150","6571690"," There's albies."
"6572050","6575270"," Well, those restaurants called like the Darden type restaurant places. "
"6578500","6579260"," Yeah, exactly."
"6579940","6581460"," We'll serve the bear from it."
"6586020","6586740"," Yeah, it'd be cool. "
"6587080","6587580"," It'd be fun."
"6587980","6591620"," It's like, what's the, what's the gaming place that everybody goes to?"
"6592440","6595640"," Bobs or bills or something or busters or something like that."
"6595700","6596460"," I don't know what place is called. "
"6598040","6601400"," It's like some like gaming restaurant that adults go to."
"6601660","6603900"," If you made like a tavern themed D and D thing."
"6606560","6609000"," I think it'd be a fucking blast. "
"6611320","6611880"," Busters."
"6612220","6612260"," Yeah."
"6612480","6612660"," Busters. "
"6613600","6614520"," David Busters."
"6614720","6614960"," Exactly."
"6615340","6615680"," David Busters. "
"6616580","6616860"," Like David."
"6617040","6617660"," Like think about that."
"6617760","6620840"," Like David Busters, but like fantasy themed. "
"6622140","6624800"," Like fantasy, dungeon dragons, big tavern and shit."
"6624940","6627660"," They'd be like tavern games related to dungeons and dragons."
"6628320","6629140"," You have like. "
"6630220","6633660"," Bourbons and wines and meat and all that kind of shit."
"6633660","6634420"," They'd have like."
"6635040","6636360"," Kind of medieval ask. "
"6637680","6638640"," Food music."
"6638640","6640320"," We kind of."
"6640320","6646290"," I don't know. "
"6646410","6647550"," It'd be cool for like a."
"6648090","6649250"," It'd be cool for like a."
"6649850","6650330"," I don't know."
"6650930","6656130"," They're just a theme restaurant around the entire U.S. I don't know if it'd be profitable or not."
"6657510","6661070"," You got people you like parking their asses and seats. "
"6661070","6662290"," You want them in and out, right?"
"6662710","6664490"," It's like the coffee cafe conundrum."
"6665650","6671150"," The conundrum with coffee shops and cafes is they want you to buy your coffee and get the fuck out."
"6671710","6673390"," They don't want you sitting there. "
"6673770","6674410"," Did you know that?"
"6674530","6676750"," Or you may or may not know that, but they don't want you sitting there."
"6677250","6678410"," They want you to get your coffee."
"6678930","6680630"," If you sit there, you would be like 15 minutes. "
"6681110","6683930"," They don't want you sitting there two, three hours taking up like seats."
"6687030","6690570"," So you like if you had somebody come in and with their friends."
"6691310","6693130"," You want them spending money, right?"
"6693310","6696130"," So if they're sitting at a table, they're going to play a game. "
"6696810","6699630"," You got a you got a hammer for all the work."
"6700230","6701250"," Or take them out."
"6701770","6704730"," So I don't know where you fix that aspect to that. "
"6705270","6706150"," These are that concept."
"6708130","6709890"," Like they better be spending money, right?"
"6710270","6711650"," So maybe maybe like the bowling."
"6712130","6713150"," You do it like bowling. "
"6716130","6718990"," You're like you're like renting a table like renting a lane."
"6722080","6723800"," Because that's what's called turning tables."
"6724840","6729660"," So you'd have to if you don't if you're not turning tables, then you have to rent the fucking"
"6729660","6730320"," table, right?"
"6731980","6737520"," So maybe if you maybe if you took the focus off of an actual dining room table. "
"6739780","6742520"," Then you made it a specific gaming table."
"6743260","6744780"," It would it would be a queue."
"6746780","6748520"," To be like, oh, we're not going out to dinner. "
"6749580","6751860"," We're going to go game, right?"
"6752060","6753160"," So we're going to go do some gaming."
"6754340","6755320"," That would be the highlight."
"6755320","6756420"," Like we're going to do some gaming. "
"6756660","6757340"," Well, how much does it cost?"
"6758240","6763880"," Well, the table costs 30 bucks or 20 bucks a person per hour."
"6764920","6766380"," So bowling here costs."
"6767580","6772440"," Anywhere from $12 to $15 on the cheap side per hour per person. "
"6773600","6777300"," To about $30 a person per hour where I live."
"6777380","6781200"," It's about 12 bucks to the cheap and then 30 bucks in the nice."
"6781620","6785580"," Nice place like hipster places and it's Friday night or some shit like that. "
"6786200","6791420"," So you'd figure the table would be about $12 to $30 a person per hour."
"6791420","6794300"," And then you'd order food on top of that."
"6794640","6797140"," So you take the focus off of being a restaurant or a bar. "
"6797580","6802840"," But the focus on it being you're renting a table, right?"
"6803060","6806240"," Then you wouldn't have to worry about turning those tables, would you?"
"6809190","6811110"," It'd be just like an hourly bowling rental."
"6811610","6812110"," That's what it would be."
"6812630","6814130"," You get it'd be a kick-ass table. "
"6814230","6816430"," You'd have like feeling a nice stained table."
"6816970","6818830"," It would have like all the interactive shit on it."
"6818830","6820730"," You'd have like TV built into it. "
"6821330","6827430"," You'd have like nice armrest, drink holders sliding in and out."
"6828450","6834070"," It would come with like dice and all kinds of crap and the server would offer you a game."
"6834370","6835190"," Which game would you like to play?"
"6836410","6842710"," And you'd pick a game and then the TV that was built into the table would have the basic"
"6842710","6848570"," instructions or intermediate instructions or expert instructions. "
"6849210","6853070"," And it would give you a quick how to play this game really quickly so you know how to play"
"6853070","6853190"," it."
"6853610","6856170"," Especially if it's like an easy, if you're like, I've never played this game before."
"6856990","6858210"," Like just simplified instructions. "
"6859190","6859530"," Sit down."
"6860070","6860850"," You watch your instructions."
"6861330","6862210"," Boom, then your timer starts. "
"6863190","6864690"," Your rental starts after you read the instructions."
"6864830","6867230"," It's not trying to steal anything from you being there for the first time."
"6867410","6872910"," So you get given like 15, 20 minutes of introduction for free compliments of the house. "
"6874150","6877430"," And then you rent you have your rental for two, three hours or something like that."
"6882900","6884280"," Oh, so people have tried it."
"6884460","6884600"," Yeah. "
"6884980","6886000"," So we have these here."
"6886620","6890460"," So like we have, we have these, we have two bars that do it here."
"6892300","6893540"," And they're successful. "
"6894820","6899340"," And matter of fact, there's some, there's a couple places I've seen that do it in New York."
"6899680","6900520"," And they're badass."
"6901020","6905560"," The two restaurants that I know that do it in New York City, they're fucking super cool. "
"6907240","6908480"," Super, super, super cool."
"6912600","6914120"," What do I think about this price action?"
"6914120","6915620"," We're going to squeeze the fuck out of this."
"6916440","6918240"," I'm thinking about closing some puts here. "
"6918340","6920160"," I've got a put protection on."
"6920440","6923040"," I'm like, they're worth eight cents right now."
"6923740","6925160"," I don't know if I leave them on or not. "
"6925360","6926000"," I think we're going to squeeze."
"6927740","6928880"," And I'm long in this market."
"6929140","6930200"," So I'm long in a big way. "
"6930320","6934460"," I've got 300 call spreads for December."
"6934780","6936740"," So I'm still bullish here."
"6936900","6938560"," My money is where mouth is. "
"6938820","6948780"," So yeah, I think you have to do that."
"6948780","6951080"," I think you have to take the focus off of it being a restaurant."
"6951420","6952440"," Like it can't be a restaurant. "
"6952720","6954000"," It's like you have a gaming place."
"6954480","6956000"," Your focus is on gaming."
"6957760","6961560"," Otherwise, you're going to get people renting, renting table space from you. "
"6961860","6964760"," You have like some asshole come in and he'll buy dinner."
"6966480","6971180"," And he'll think he can just sit there all night long and, you know, fuck you and your restaurant,"
"6971280","6971700"," right?"
"6972640","6974840"," I'm not leaving until I'm done."
"6975000","6977220"," How dare you try to kick me out of this restaurant?"
"6978420","6981360"," So you got like immediately when you come into this place, you got to know. "
"6982520","6984740"," Clear as day that you're renting a fucking table."
"6985080","6986340"," Like it has to be clear as day."
"6986960","6987360"," Yeah. "
"6988340","6990940"," The cool part about this is you could do it like this too."
"6991000","6994620"," You could be like, it's $12 a person."
"6996320","7001760"," If your average food and beverage is 50 per person or something, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. "
"7003220","7004160"," I guess maybe I would."
"7004320","7005980"," I don't know if you want to complicate it like that."
"7010180","7015540"," So I think, yeah, I think like you put the focus on it's it's 12 bucks person per hour. "
"7016560","7019200"," And you can eat while you're playing games or whatever."
"7019740","7020700"," Keep it simple."
"7020820","7021760"," Squeeze and hire right now. "
"7022800","7024640"," Fading 43 cents on 424."
"7026200","7028620"," It's basically paying for my puts right now."
"7030360","7031420"," Still leave him on. "
"7032260","7034740"," I'm going to look for the squeeze up to the hourly trigger."
"7035060","7037160"," Maybe pull the calls off, leave the puts on."
"7038620","7039800"," I just leave him the lead. "
"7040100","7042020"," Just leave him sitting there just hanging on or something."
"7042180","7042860"," Maybe he'll hold him."
"7043060","7043300"," Fuck it. "
"7043440","7045140"," They understand my fucking trade."
"7048080","7049960"," I'm like, do I go all in here?"
"7050400","7053600"," I'm like looking for what I don't want to do is this right here."
"7055760","7057400"," So I'm going to show you what I'm thinking about here. "
"7057400","7058500"," Squeeze up here."
"7060260","7062160"," I'm back down right there."
"7068040","7072900"," But what I don't want to happen is I don't want my calls to fucking go up here. "
"7073380","7074280"," Sorry for swearing."
"7074760","7076200"," I don't want my calls to go up here."
"7078040","7079860"," And then reprice down here. "
"7082580","7085240"," So I'm either going to try to take them off right here."
"7086420","7091200"," If we roll earlier and then bounce, I'll hold them higher."
"7091880","7094680"," So if we roll right here and we do the test, go that way. "
"7096040","7102540"," I'll stay him in him, but I want to pay for the puts at least."
"7103880","7106100"," So I'll push this over so you can see it."
"7112950","7117130"," But I'm wondering, I guess what I'm wondering here is do I take the calls off if we go up"
"7117130","7117350"," there. "
"7121370","7123750"," I'm going to stay right here and watch how this unfolds."
"7124430","7127790"," Have a cross coming up on S&P 500 in the next few moments."
"7127850","7129710"," You'll see that white line cross the red line. "
"7129750","7130750"," You should be getting bullish."
"7131890","7136490"," If this holds right here, if this holds, we should squeeze up here."
"7136990","7138790"," I'll trade that hourly trigger at the minimum. "
"7138950","7140130"," If not, break above it possibly."
"7140510","7141470"," I'm still on calls."
"7141670","7145230"," I got 10 puts and 30 or 25 calls on right now. "
"7151510","7156830"," Maybe I can take the call side off right here, then close the puts right here, then get long and"
"7156830","7157770"," just calls right there."
"7158710","7167230"," So sell calls, sell puts, and then buy calls"
"7167230","7169890"," right there."
"7170330","7178940"," See if we can wrangle this. "
"7178940","7194620"," I think"
"7206980","7208900"," the customers would love it, but the owners wouldn't."
"7210540","7213360"," I think I think it's doable as a concept."
"7213980","7215040"," I think like conceptually. "
"7216500","7218340"," Well, one of the cool parts is this."
"7218820","7222300"," So if you do it, if you do it like RPG based."
"7223640","7229580"," You can slightly change a bunch of it without having to pay D&D or as a world of war"
"7229580","7229980"," craft. "
"7231700","7234740"," To to have that kind of a themed concept."
"7239650","7242950"," You know, watch, you're going to watch me, you're going to."
"7242950","7245790"," To try to sell calls right right here. "
"7246330","7250230"," Try to sell the puts right here and then enter calls right there like sell calls."
"7251730","7253890"," Sell puts, buy more calls."
"7255750","7256370"," Something like that. "
"7260880","7267880"," Like you don't you don't have to pay anybody for for the concept right as long as you'd like, don't"
"7267880","7272200"," use specific things from world of work or we're not world of work craft."
"7272280","7273060"," I said world of work craft."
"7273300","7276880"," It's not world of work. "
"7286300","7290300"," I'm not getting my some you know I'm doing some going to that you want to know why I'm going"
"7290300","7290820"," to the doctor."
"7291360","7292260"," I'll tell you why."
"7293060","7298520"," No prostate check today, though I probably need a prostate check, but no prostate. "
"7298760","7302400"," So we're checking right now early testing this five minute trigger right now."
"7303320","7310320"," I'm actually going to the doctor because my wife had."
"7311520","7314380"," My wife had a seasonal depression. "
"7316840","7319520"," Last winter, so last winter."
"7321660","7326960"," So last winter, it got really gray and cold early in the year."
"7328140","7335260"," And it didn't get extremely cold last winter, but it got grayish, rainish and kind of miserable"
"7335260","7337240"," early in the year. "
"7338620","7341000"," And it stayed like that."
"7342420","7348040"," Unseasonably early and then late into the spring and she had seasonal depression."
"7348040","7354060"," And so she went to the doctor. "
"7354160","7358240"," The doctor gave her a prescription to deal with seasonal depression."
"7360000","7361420"," And this isn't like a big thing."
"7361540","7363740"," It's like a minor, minor drug. "
"7363940","7367280"," I think she got I don't know if it's minor or not, but I'll have to get the name of"
"7367280","7367400"," it."
"7368020","7371520"," And so she got this drug for it and she took it all last year."
"7372000","7375640"," She took it the all last fall winter in the spring. "
"7376400","7377900"," She's still on it right now."
"7377960","7380920"," She doesn't take a ton of it, but she takes it, I believe once a day."
"7382060","7385520"," And she says that it's helped her with seasonal depression. "
"7386660","7391460"," So she's like, I'm going to make an appointment for you to talk to the doctor because we're coming"
"7391460","7392360"," into fall right now."
"7393880","7395280"," About seasonal depression."
"7395780","7399180"," So whenever we go through the fall and winter, I'm not from here. "
"7400280","7401840"," You have to keep yourself busy."
"7402020","7405020"," You have to do a lot of stuff to keep yourself busy."
"7405020","7409720"," You got like fly places to go skiing, fly places to go surfing, hike and bike and all that kind"
"7409720","7410020"," of stuff. "
"7410340","7413360"," Or Dungeons and Dragons, another way to help with that."
"7414300","7420980"," When you go through these winters in the Midwest, if you don't keep yourself like very active, you"
"7420980","7421800"," can experience that."
"7421800","7426220"," Another similar place would be like Portland or Seattle. "
"7426640","7432560"," If you're from those places, you know what I'm talking about where you don't have a lot of days of"
"7432560","7432860"," sunshine."
"7434920","7438100"," And you get like a seasonal mood disorder of some kind."
"7438660","7443080"," So she was talking to me about it because she did this last fall and I didn't. "
"7444280","7447180"," And I don't like taking prescription drugs."
"7447480","7449640"," I never ask for prescriptions for my doctors ever."
"7450160","7453000"," But she had a better go of last winter than I did. "
"7453000","7455180"," She was happier than I was last winter."
"7457480","7459860"," I take vitamin D, I'm outside all the time."
"7460280","7461460"," I spend a lot of time outside. "
"7462140","7463900"," But I still struggled last year."
"7464580","7468280"," So I'm gonna go talk to this doctor today and see what they have to say about it."
"7469140","7471460"," And see if I should go on this drug or not. "
"7473400","7475200"," Yeah, seasonal effective disorder."
"7475480","7475980"," That's what it's called."
"7476140","7476820"," That's what my wife had. "
"7476820","7482390"," That is what my wife had or has."
"7483130","7484890"," She had never taken anything for it either."
"7485050","7486150"," I'm gonna ask her what she takes. "
"7486870","7490050"," So I don't drink alcohol right now."
"7490090","7491370"," I drink some beer, but I don't drink alcohol."

"8320340","8321040"," I don't know."
"8321219","8324340"," I don't think that I'll say that."

"8347760","8349920"," And she's like, women don't care. "
"8350840","8355420"," So Brad, what I was told is women don't care if you tell them that you want dick pills."
"8356120","8358080"," They've heard everything, so they don't care, brother."
"8359200","8363740"," But I understand the feeling of not wanting to say that to your female doctor. "

"8465770","8466890"," I bet you could create his own Twitter."
"8474380","8480920"," Just take the C and D pill, not the VD pill."
"8484580","8487520"," Apparently your wife's an amateur cardiologist and porn star. "
"8493360","8498040"," Rocket surgeon, apparently my wife's an amateur cardiologist and porn star."
"8504490","8506090"," You guys follow Quinn out there?"
"8506210","8514990"," So Quinn, one of my favorite parts about Quinn is that he intentionally tries to, I don't know if I"

"8537530","8539630"," They're like, they're like, get out right here, boss."
"8546760","8551300"," The, when I first met Quinn, I was, when I first met Quinn, I was like, oh, this guy's super"
"8551300","8551620"," smart. "
"8551740","8551860"," Awesome."
"8552920","8555860"," I thought I was like, oh man, Quinn says some really bad shit."
"8555860","8563640"," But then I figured it out quickly that I was like, Quinn is trying to intentionally game the"
"8563640","8567540"," Twitter system to find out what you should and shouldn't do. "
"8567700","8574300"," You know what else does a good job at this is a ST short sell, short sell or ST does"
"8574300","8574780"," this too."
"8575900","8581160"," So he'll run tests and say, watch what he'll be like when I post this stuff, you can see the"
"8581160","8582100"," traction that I get."
"8582100","8586500"," So I fell in love with Quinn, then of course the met him person, he's fucking awesome. "
"8588840","8593480"," And the guy is like, you know, you want to make a hundred thousand followers count in five minutes?"
"8593780","8593860"," Done."
"8595400","8596520"," It's, it's fascinating."
"8597700","8606360"," Especially when you know, when you know what to do, to break Twitter, whatever, like when then"
"8606360","8609520"," learning how to break Twitter, I think that's cool, super fucking cool. "
"8617820","8619160"," Yeah, like how do you break Twitter?"
"8619440","8620740"," Like, what do you have to do to break Twitter?"
"8621020","8624420"," And so you run a bunch of different programs and you try to break Twitter."
"8624540","8626060"," So I find out the ins and outs of Twitter."
"8627960","8630800"," And it's fascinating, fascinating, fascinating. "
"8632620","8637080"," And so Quinn can tell you why people have a million followers, why people have a hundred thousand"
"8637080","8641020"," followers, why people have half a million followers, how do they do it?"
"8641420","8644540"," So he's the guy, he's a guy that can actually tell you how that happens."
"8644780","8646340"," And it, it ain't pretty."
"8647820","8648700"," It's not pretty. "
"8651320","8653820"," It's definitely not pretty why you get those followers."
"8654940","8656980"," Or majority of people, why they get those followers."
"8665080","8667240"," Come on, man, get me out of the put side, please. "
"8669200","8670660"," 1239, I'm supposed to be leaving."
"8670940","8672400"," I'll try to stick around until one."
"8672400","8674700"," So I've made some money on some calls. "
"8675100","8676860"," Well, let's start somewhere else."
"8676960","8678800"," I lost seven fucking cents on calls."
"8679620","8684160"," Then I made a pretty good trade on 25 calls a second time to the upside. "
"8686300","8689320"," When I lost, I got stopped out on calls down here."
"8690120","8691440"," I got stopped out right here."
"8692260","8695120"," Stopped out on calls, re-entered some calls for that trade. "
"8696020","8697260"," Put some puts on over here."
"8698080","8699520"," They're still sitting on right now."
"8699680","8700740"," They're four cents right now. "
"8700780","8701420"," They're worth nothing."
"8701960","8707900"," I'm hoping to get out of those puts on some kind of a weak moment before we head higher."
"8708900","8710480"," I've got a doctor's appointment I've got to go to. "
"8714160","8716300"," They're like telling me, here's your chance."
"8717580","8721600"," Hopefully get a liquidation break so I can get out and be flat."
"8722020","8728600"," I'd like to be flat into 4 p.m. So I'm not worried about some zero-day puts in here. "
"8731040","8735020"," But if I don't get let out, then I'll so be it."
"8735400","8737680"," So I'll just manage the fucking trade for what it is."
"8738220","8739580"," A little bit of blood right now. "
"8740740","8741820"," Five cents right now."
"8741940","8744920"," I'd like to see him be like eight to ten cents."
"8745900","8746720"," It would be my preference. "
"8748200","8749760"," So we'll see if we can get that or not."
"8750420","8751260"," A little bit of blood right here."
"8755710","8757250"," Yeah, we need to interview Quinn again. "
"8757670","8758250"," I agree, Binky."
"8759530","8761370"," We used to have him on the show more frequently."
"8761710","8765350"," We do now, but we have to have Quinn on again. "
"8765570","8766650"," We need to have Quinn on soon."
"8768310","8772410"," Like try to do a full invitation to have Quinn on because he's a fascinating guy."
"8772510","8773610"," Guy's a genius. "
"8775170","8779230"," He's a, do you guys know what Quinn's job is in real life?"
"8781210","8787630"," He's a machine learning and artificial intelligence engineer, I believe."
"8787630","8788530"," It could be wrong in that."
"8788650","8789570"," That's what I think that he is. "
"8790130","8790810"," That's what he does."
"8791350","8792110"," For big tech."
"8792470","8792770"," He's a badass. "
"8793450","8795170"," Motherfuckers does not fuck around."
"8795550","8796370"," Smart as they come."
"8797750","8798750"," He's kind of a genius. "
"8799990","8801670"," So I have, I have, hold him in high regard."
"8803070","8808710"," I could, Binky, we could sit there and just like send him like 20 questions or 100 questions and"
"8808710","8811510"," have him pick 20 of them and just pick his brain."
"8821440","8824960"," Yes, so we are doing the, oh, hold on a second here. "
"8828740","8829980"," Hold on a second here."
"8834780","8840960"," So we are, I am doing this, the show tomorrow is going to be based on how to use the"
"8840960","8841140"," tool."
"8842660","8844020"," For people that have the tool. "
"8845700","8854320"," We're going to get grant access to, to moderators, administrators"
"8854320","8864120"," and long time friends of what we're doing, the people that we trust so they can test it and report"
"8864120","8864420"," back."
"8864700","8866340"," That's going to take one to three weeks."
"8866980","8868540"," It could take until like started next week. "
"8870240","8873560"," And if we don't, if we have problems, it could come up to about three weeks."
"8873560","8877880"," But if we don't have any issues, that need immediate attention."
"8878780","8883740"," If we find out by Monday of next week that everything is okay, then I have to wait for the"
"8883740","8885620"," admins and moderators to feel confident. "
"8886260","8891480"," Get the white paper, get the videos done and partitioned off."
"8892320","8896360"," Like Binky has to do some editing to get the videos into a package."
"8897120","8904520"," So that once you get the tool from me, you have a white paper, videos and you have support from"
"8904520","8905580"," the admins and moderators. "
"8906460","8908340"," So someone's asking when is the tool going to be released?"
"8909100","8914340"," I want you to know that if I'm going to release the tool to you, I want you to be"
"8914340","8918360"," able to have a support system of people that are familiar."
"8919640","8920660"," They feel confident."
"8921240","8924600"," I want you to have a video series so that you can feel confident. "
"8924600","8927900"," And then I want you to have a white paper so that you can feel confident."
"8928120","8931240"," So it's going to be one to three weeks before it gets released publicly."
"8932020","8932540"," Good question. "
"8933400","8939940"," I don't want to just release it to you so that you're like on your own, like, here, have fucking"
"8939940","8940200"," fun."
"8940820","8944380"," Although you probably want that, I don't want to give it to you like that."
"8944520","8952100"," So you're going to get it with a team of people somewhere between 20 and 30 people that should be"
"8952100","8955080"," able to help you answer the questions that you have. "
"8955700","8961100"," You'll also have that white paper and you'll have a nice video series and everything that you need"
"8961100","8962860"," to feel confident."
"8967460","8970160"," Oh, wait a minute."
"8970620","8971420"," Hold on here. "
"8971540","8971760"," Let me look."
"8973400","8974740"," Hey, Ken Nick Mobile."
"8976240","8977200"," Hold on a second here. "
"8977200","8977880"," I got to check on."
"8978660","8981720"," Let me look on Twitter."
"8982000","8982940"," Twitch really quick here. "
"8983060","8984360"," Someone said just put me on the mod channel."
"8988420","8990000"," You guys are scrolling so fast."
"9000620","9002740"," Good Christians don't talk about their dick pills. "
"9005160","9005900"," Captain coin."
"9007160","9008340"," That's what it is."
"9008440","9009400"," Quinn and I discussed that. "
"9010140","9015280"," You're like, we should make a scam, a scam crypto and a scam NFT and tell everybody it's a scam."
"9015760","9017760"," Just point blank, tell people it's a fucking scam."
"9018340","9019040"," Buy it now. "
"9021680","9027380"," We should do like a scam NFT and a scam crypto and just point blank, just like say this is"
"9027380","9028180"," a fraud scam."
"9028780","9030040"," See if anyone buys them."
"9033260","9034760"," It would be funny if they did. "
"9036000","9037520"," It would probably go to the moon too."
"9037660","9038460"," That's the fucked up part."
"9038680","9042040"," It would probably go to the fucking moon because you're all a bunch of degenerate gamblers. "
"9044420","9047940"," Well, not to the moon."
"9048100","9050800"," It probably go to the moon with like 500 people like 500 of us."
"9051380","9052800"," You know how you like you do a bet?"
"9053640","9055940"," Let's say like 20 of us and we're betting on the Super Bowl. "
"9055940","9059480"," Like we all put $20 in and the winner gets 500."
"9061940","9065020"," It probably turned into something like that, right?"
"9065560","9069700"," We'll run it up to like there'll be like 500 of us will run it up to like one from"
"9069700","9071520"," one penny to like 10 pennies."
"9071600","9073260"," We'll release like 500 coins. "
"9074780","9076500"," That someone sells out."
"9077340","9081040"," We all get fucked in one person in our group to take all the money."
"9081400","9082120"," Probably Quinn. "
"9083080","9083940"," Probably Quinn."
"9084460","9089080"," We'll call it the Captain Jim James full Ponzi scam point and FT."
"9091140","9092200"," It's so terrible. "
"9095840","9096600"," Knook mobile."
"9098020","9099180"," Where are you?"
"9101120","9102220"," There you are."
"9103120","9103760"," I see it. "
"9103840","9104400"," I see it now."
"9104540","9104860"," Knook mobile."
"9110930","9111650"," Knook mobile. "
"9111930","9112350"," What is your."
"9113870","9114730"," What is your."
"9117030","9117910"," Your discord. "
"9118770","9119210"," Handle."
"9119430","9120370"," Not your discord name."
"9121090","9121590"," Your handle. "
"9121790","9122130"," Like the one."
"9122290","9122890"," Not the one that's not."
"9123050","9124650"," Not the one that shows in discord. "
"9125570","9128390"," What's the one that your actual handle in discord?"
"9128590","9129810"," Can you type that in Twitch right now?"
"9136960","9138320"," Hey, uh, Bumbledine."
"9138480","9139800"," Thanks for getting a tier one sub, brother."
"9139820","9140600"," Appreciate that, man. "
"9142540","9143360"," Yeah, exactly."
"9143640","9144560"," It's basically Dogecoin."
"9146380","9147640"," It's basically Dogecoin. "
"9148380","9149220"," And that's the other."
"9149400","9151280"," I guess we have to make rules for it, wouldn't we?"
"9151540","9152560"," We have to make fucking rules."
"9153380","9153740"," The rule. "
"9153920","9155280"," I got to get in so much trouble with doctor."
"9155900","9158520"," We have to make rules for it."
"9158640","9160300"," We'll call it what it is. "
"9160660","9162080"," A Ponzi scheme, right?"
"9162340","9166520"," Like call it Captain Jim James Ponzi scheme and FT and coin, right?"
"9167160","9172920"," And then what we'll do is we'll make it so that we like intentionally don't talk about it."
"9173740","9174500"," We'll make rules."
"9175220","9183180"," Like Captain Jim James will not talk about the Ponzi scam coin unless it's like the most"
"9183180","9184240"," inappropriate moment. "
"9185360","9187620"," So if it's going up, I won't talk about it."
"9188000","9192580"," But only if it's in the dumpster fire, it's like trade negative."
"9193580","9198620"," Then I'll come out and say something like, I don't know, fucking make up something stupid. "
"9198620","9203160"," I guess we need some kind of animal mascot or something for it, right?"
"9203380","9205360"," We should totally fuck around with this one day."
"9205940","9207440"," It'd be hilarious to do in stream."
"9208860","9213400"," Like find like an animal mascot and like, pull on, tell people it's a scam. "
"9214380","9220040"," Maybe we could donate all of the money from it to a nonprofit or something too."
"9220560","9221880"," I wouldn't want to make a dollar from it."
"9222000","9224160"," So we could do it to where it's like, we know it's a scam. "
"9224740","9227880"," We know that the exit scam will be to a nonprofit."
"9228100","9229820"," I don't know, something like that would be fun."
"9238620","9240560"," I'm reading that, Dr. God, it's hilarious. "
"9246640","9252620"," You could have like the coin with like the original, like the founder be like a nonprofit or so."
"9252620","9257160"," I don't know how we'd do it, but like it will have the nonprofit exit scam, the coin."
"9260180","9264280"," I guess we'd have to be in charge of it, but whatever the whatever we want to exit scam will"
"9264280","9264640"," be public. "
"9264640","9266280"," We'll say we're exit scamming right now."
"9268120","9272860"," Go on stream, like we're exit scamming or to donate all the money to the fucking dog shelter."
"9273800","9274480"," Fuck you. "
"9279060","9283060"," If I get if I catch both sides of the street today, I'm going to laugh my ass off."
"9283380","9285340"," Well, if I can exit these fucking puts."
"9287840","9290280"," I'm going to laugh my fucking ass off here. "
"9290340","9293880"," If I catch through the calls, got the fucking puts to be ridiculous."
"9301860","9305620"," Is anybody reading what Dr. God is writing on Twitch right now?"
"9305680","9306720"," It's fucking making me cry."
"9310300","9317680"," Like Dr. God said, like in a tweet spotted by ETH news, team just the developers behind the exit"
"9317680","9320460"," scam gave a brief and gradually messaged to an unknown. "
"9321620","9324200"," Wall and holder, wall and owner."
"9324500","9331860"," After the lucky recipient of 10,000 to support 690th time of this writing, this is about 2.8"
"9331860","9332140"," million."
"9334780","9340640"," For those of you out of the loop, FOMO 3D is a sort of Ponzi gambling crossover scheme built on"
"9340640","9343120"," Ethereum based smart charts or smart contracts. "
"9351640","9352360"," Oh, fuck."
"9357190","9358310"," Oh, connect mobile."
"9360690","9361650"," Sorry, connect mobile. "
"9362230","9362750"," We'll deal with it."
"9362850","9364650"," We're going to do the switch today, aren't we?"
"9366170","9366810"," All right, brother."
"9367030","9367370"," I'll look at. "
"9367550","9368930"," I'll give you a shot tonight, bro."
"9369430","9370370"," We'll give you a shot, brother."
"9372750","9374630"," I'll just put you in right now until we switch. "
"9374810","9375190"," How about that?"
"9375190","9376050"," I'll do that for you."
"9377450","9378250"," No, no, no, no."
"9378430","9378690"," All right. "
"9379350","9379570"," All right."
"9380010","9381150"," So I'll get you in the room."
"9385960","9390740"," And then we'll talk about your, um, your, your, uh, hilarious. "
"9391300","9394140"," Well, then we'll talk about your trading view account username."
"9394540","9398060"," Don't tell anybody here what your trading view account user or I guess it doesn't matter if you do"
"9398060","9400420"," here, but I'll get you in right now, brother."
"9400720","9401160"," I got you covered. "
"9405950","9406270"," Yeah."
"9406390","9406470"," Yeah."
"9406690","9411010"," That's like, like, that, like, Dr. God, we need to run something like that. "
"9411230","9414410"," We need to run it so that we don't, we don't want to profit off it."
"9414530","9415510"," We just want to give the money away."
"9417070","9418810"," It'll probably be amongst all of us anyways. "
"9419430","9421410"," What would be, let me ask you guys a question."
"9421650","9424910"," If we ran something like that, right, where would you want all the money to go?"
"9425090","9426650"," What would be the nonprofit that takes the money?"
"9428170","9429650"," Like who would we give the money to?"
"9430470","9434010"," We would probably can't talk about it on Twitter or anything."
"9434130","9435210"," It'll just be amongst us friends. "
"9436230","9439310"," Who would be the, uh, who do you think we should give the money to like?"
"9439770","9443450"," Um, what's like an innocuous, like everybody likes dogs."
"9443970","9444610"," Everybody likes cats."
"9445650","9447610"," It has to be something that everybody can get behind. "
"9449910","9450930"," Strippers without borders."
"9451010","9452290"," I think everybody can get behind that one."
"9460670","9462130"," We'll just call the coin stripper. "
"9465050","9465750"," So bad."
"9473700","9475100"," Let's have a chat charity."
"9475580","9478180"," How about this before we go any further in this conversation, right?"
"9478820","9480800"," I want to ask Quinn about it and see if we can do it. "
"9480840","9482120"," He talked to me about this recently."
"9482120","9487440"," So I'll ask him, I'll ask him if he knows if, if we can do it, how to do it"
"9487440","9491540"," and how to structure it so that we could, it would like, no matter what the money would go, not"
"9491540","9496400"," no matter what, but we'd have the exit scam for the nonprofit to get the money."
"9499000","9500080"," Oh, I'll ask Quinn. "
"9500220","9500800"," I'll see what he says."
"9500960","9501400"," It's a possible."
"9504380","9505360"," Wolves without packs. "
"9510800","9516220"," Kitty shelter, kidding coins, caps, cougar coin, bang out with my wing out."
"9517360","9518360"," Puppies and kitties."
"9521700","9523540"," All right, let me move this to the side. "
"9536450","9537410"," All right, add."
"9537410","9538830"," He's fucking killing me."
"9543340","9544280"," Hold on here. "
"9548080","9548820"," Who's a."
"9550940","9551820"," Mary's landscape."
"9552020","9553420"," He's a few extra bucks."

"9569820","9574080"," You won't click second brother. "
"9577860","9578860"," Should I exit my puts?"
"9579240","9582520"," I have to go to the doctors in the next few minutes."
"9582600","9583360"," I got to leave actually."
"9585320","9589280"," What do you guys, let me take a quick, quick poll on YouTube and Twitch. "
"9590340","9594400"," Should I leave my puts on for the bell?"
"9595040","9595420"," They're not many."
"9595580","9596020"," It's only 10."
"9597200","9598060"," I got 10 puts. "
"9598640","9599660"," They don't really mean shit."
"9600380","9602780"," Do I leave the puts on in the end of the day?"
"9603260","9607960"," Do I cut them here by calls for the end of the day or just stay flat?"
"9608820","9610160"," What do you guys think that I should do?"
"9614620","9616260"," Hey, I'm with Border Pillads."
"9618920","9624810"," Can I trade my scam coin for big pills?"
"9631490","9632630"," You didn't cut him right here. "
"9635550","9637690"," You're saying cut him, keep him."
"9638550","9639690"," Cut and switch the calls."
"9640870","9641470"," Or cut him. "
"9641610","9642690"," Maybe I should double down the puts."
"9644490","9644950"," What's up?"
"9645110","9645310"," I suggest."
"9645650","9646090"," How you doing, brother?"
"9646430","9649750"," Good to see you. "
"9649850","9655030"," Yeah, that's what I say."
"9655110","9655490"," It's like 10."
"9656690","9657770"," I took 25 calls early. "
"9657930","9661890"," I took 10 calls early and 25 calls to fucking make my money back."
"9661890","9662950"," And 10 goddamn calls."
"9665790","9667370"," I say I leave them on. "
"9670090","9671410"," I think I leave them on."
"9671530","9672570"," I want to see this cross here."
"9673190","9674810"," See this cross that's happening right here?"
"9677990","9680390"," See this cross that's going on right here?"
"9682150","9684050"," A little tiny sneaky like. "
"9684310","9686050"," A little tiny sneaky like."
"9687890","9690130"," Now, do I think this is going to happen at this moment?"
"9690370","9690930"," Maybe not."
"9691890","9693470"," But if it goes something like this. "
"9696110","9698270"," It goes something like."
"9702430","9703690"," Hold on here."
"9704870","9709820"," It goes something like this. "
"9714340","9715860"," And then the bloodbath."
"9716240","9718420"," We start trading like that down there."
"9720600","9721760"," I'll probably be happy. "
"9721880","9722840"," I think we leave the puts on."
"9725300","9726480"," I'm going to leave the puts on."
"9726780","9730220"," See if we see if we trade back and retest this prior low over here. "
"9730940","9732240"," It's prior low right here."
"9737000","9740460"," Leave that little yellow line down there, that 421 18."
"9742840","9743820"," I'm going to leave them on. "
"9744560","9747200"," I appreciate the input that you gave me in the chat, but."
"9748140","9750740"," Let's see if we get like some kind of like."
"9751340","9751780"," Bam. "
"9753140","9755680"," And then back up and I can exit the puts."
"9761500","9762580"," Okay, so."
"9763440","9764060"," Let me. "
"9765680","9766560"," Oh, shoot."
"9773160","9775400"," Okay, so what I'm going to do here is this."
"9778740","9780600"," I'm going to leave this right here. "
"9781680","9783200"," You got your chart right."
"9788080","9789100"," Time is that."
"9795240","9796300"," Four PM. "
"9801680","9802620"," Right there."
"9803040","9803400"," Okay."
"9805100","9806980"," I'm going to leave this right here. "
"9809660","9811940"," Here's a four PM."
"9812280","9814020"," I probably don't need that there."
"9815360","9816320"," Right there. "
"9819550","9822910"," I'm going to leave that right there for you so you can see it."
"9824270","9825850"," I want to make sure."
"9828070","9829130"," That you have. "
"9829430","9829750"," There you go."
"9830110","9831510"," I think that's all you need right there."
"9833650","9834930"," Okay, so while I'm gone. "
"9837090","9840690"," While I am gone, I'm going to leave this up for you right here."
"9841970","9844530"," See they can auto size that perfect."
"9845150","9847570"," So this one, the bottom chart is on auto. "
"9847870","9849850"," So you'll be able to see if we roll down or up."
"9851350","9852750"," I've got this one here."
"9853210","9856410"," I am hoping for some a little bit more blood. "
"9856590","9859910"," I'm hoping for a little bit of a roll here and then that move higher."
"9860150","9861670"," I've got some puts on, not many."
"9862890","9864370"," I've got a ton of calls on. "
"9865290","9867950"," I don't want to see a break below this."
"9869170","9870730"," This is where call spreads are."
"9871090","9873330"," I want to stay above those call spreads at all times. "
"9874310","9876490"," So I'm going to go to my doctor's appointment here."
"9877950","9880750"," If we don't have this rejection to the downside."
"9880750","9883730"," You could have that cross down there though. "
"9883930","9884470"," Then the move higher."
"9884730","9889610"," We already know that if we hold right here, we know that we're going to squeeze higher above and"
"9889610","9891490"," begin to trade higher up there."
"9892550","9894970"," I'm going to put on the new squacker. "
"9895110","9895510"," Well, I'm gone."
"9895950","9903650"," If you're a moderator, if you're a moderator in this stream on Twitch and YouTube."
"9905190","9908150"," While I am gone, I'm going to say this one time. "
"9911710","9915430"," So while I am gone, no fucking around in the chat."
"9916750","9922410"," So if you find anyone fucking around and not you, but if you find people fucking around in this"
"9922410","9925790"," chat, then instant ban."
"9926710","9929990"," If they, if you don't do that, right?"
"9930490","9933970"," I will be forced to turn the chat off whenever I'm gone. "
"9934510","9938110"," So if we have children, you're not a child."
"9938110","9942250"," If we have children, you give children so many chances, right?"
"9942430","9946050"," Try to work with them, work with them to get what you need to happen done."
"9946730","9948110"," So you're like the parent. "
"9948870","9951990"," So we've given leeway, leeway, leeway, leeway."
"9952570","9957430"," We started with no, first we had the Russian hooker bots coming in, right?"
"9957630","9958850"," So you got like Russian bots coming in."
"9958950","9959710"," We got other bots coming in. "
"9959810","9963050"," We get people to come in trying to steal people kinds of wack shit, right?"
"9963610","9964110"," It's craziness."
"9965550","9967030"," So I'm asking you, well, I'm gone."
"9968330","9970870"," To, to manage the chat on Twitch and YouTube. "
"9971850","9973210"," And I don't want to turn off the chat."
"9973410","9973730"," I want to leave."
"9974050","9975490"," Let me be honest with you. "
"9975510","9976730"," I want to be 100% honest here."
"9977190","9980170"," If you guys want this stream on five days a week."
"9981690","9987850"," From nine until four p.m. The way that it goes on nine to four, nine 30 to four. "
"9988590","9991470"," Is where I leave that chat open and shit doesn't get crazy."
"9991850","9993410"," Sometimes I leave the chat on and walk away."
"9993510","9995430"," I come back and I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?"
"9995430","9997170"," It's like animal house. "
"9997630","9999650"," So be the adult."

"10015570","10017150"," So I'm going to leave this chat open."
"10017490","10019730"," If anyone comes in here, it's instant fucking ban hammer."
"10023950","10026070"," I shouldn't say that, but it's, that's the truth. "
"10026330","10026430"," So."

"10058490","10058930"," Oh, yeah."
"10059170","10061110"," We got to put on the squacker. "
"10062190","10063350"," Put the squacker on."
"10065610","10066990"," Make sure you guys can hear the squacker."
"10067350","10067830"," All right. "
"10067990","10068570"," So the squacker zone."
"10068730","10073870"," I'm not going to turn on Bloomberg radio because they keep doing the political bullshit."

"10078510","10080430"," The CNBC audio is so delayed."
"10082410","10086090"," And I'm looking for what is, I'm going to show you what cap is hoping for."
"10086130","10087430"," This is mostly due to my positioning. "
"10087790","10089030"," This isn't what I think, but."
"10089950","10092790"," I would like to see something like that."
"10093690","10094810"," I really don't care. "
"10096670","10101470"," I really don't care if it's only momentary."
"10101930","10104270"," I just, I just need that to get out of puts."
"10104830","10107390"," So I'll leave, I'll leave what I need to get to happen. "
"10109770","10111010"," Give me the green sword."
"10112190","10114770"," So this, so the new squacker is on."
"10114850","10116130"," I'm not going to turn any radio for you. "
