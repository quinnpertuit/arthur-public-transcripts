"Vg5RFJccQ-0","79120","82120"," I'm like, what the fuck is going on here?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","82120","85120"," Anyways, the 1330 was down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","85120","87120"," When I was giving you the time earlier, it was down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","87120","93120"," It wasn't the time that you were seeing the 53, it was, it was, lost the trade time was down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","93120","96120"," Just so you can see it, it was still that with 1335."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","101120","104120"," Hold on, I gotta repost it, hold on a second, I got a bunch of crap I gotta do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","105120","109120"," And I didn't go to the bathroom either."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","109120","115120"," So I'm like, still, I didn't, I should have stopped to go to the bathroom, but I didn't."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","117120","119120"," Hold on a second here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","124120","131120"," Well, it's a good thing, so it's funny because I, at least get the, I'm not gonna get,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","131120","136120"," so I'm not gonna make any money off the stream today because I played that song earlier."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","137120","139120"," And I didn't, no, you didn't piss bag."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","140120","142120"," I didn't pour, I didn't, I didn't diaper."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","143120","145120"," I need a fucking diaper, dude."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","152120","156120"," So I'm gonna get, I'm not gonna make any money today because of the, um..."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","157120","160120"," because of the, uh, the fucking play in that song."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","161120","164120"," But, but I guess, but I guess making a new, um,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","165120","169120"," I guess making a new, um, a new video would help with some of that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","170120","174120"," If anybody comes back, a bunch of people are like, oh, dude, we're going down."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","175120","177120"," He ain't ever coming back on today."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","178120","179120"," It's gonna be terrible."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","187120","189120"," A little out of here. Hold on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","198120","201120"," I love NASDAQ. I cover it all. So we cover it on Sundays."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","202120","205120"," Uh, so I check in with NASDAQ throughout the week."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","206120","211120"," Uh, but I don't trade NASDAQ with the group, but I wanted to start, I was wondering if I cover it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","212120","214120"," If you guys, normally in the morning or at least once a week,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","214120","217120"," you know, it's talk NASDAQ or Tesla or Apple or Amazon."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","218120","223120"," Uh, if you guys have specific questions about NASDAQ, uh, it's easy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","224120","225120"," I trade S&P 500."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","226120","229120"," So the reason I trade S&P 500 is because it's easy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","231120","232120"," Uh, it's not as fast."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","233120","236120"," It's slower. It's a little bit, it's a little easier to trade for people."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","237120","238120"," Uh, but I do cover NASDAQ."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","239120","241120"," So if you ever want like coverage on NASDAQ,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","242120","244120"," there's a super chat button down there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","245120","248120"," And if you're like, Hey, I want his opinion on this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","250120","252120"," So we can get rid of all this stuff too. Look at that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","252120","253120"," We can get rid of all this stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","254120","255120"," All that shit's been taken out."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","256120","258120"," So we're going to start looking at new pivots down below."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","260120","262120"," Uh, but I don't mind if you want to trade NASDAQ with me."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","263120","267120"," Uh, I take trades on NASDAQ specific tickers and stuff like that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","268120","285120"," Uh, and like longer time period trades, but if you're looking for like, uh, coverage specifically, like a nighttime video or something like that, we just added weekend stock trading or stock picking that that's mostly NASDAQ."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","286120","289120"," Uh, and they're all winners, like every single one of them, they're all fucking winners."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","290120","296120"," Um, if you're looking for something more like, Hey, will you do like a recorded video at nighttime where I cover actual NASDAQ?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","296120","297120"," What do I expect?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","297120","299120"," We only covered on the show once a week."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","300120","302120"," Uh, some days I try to cover it with got what people do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","303120","315120"," Thank man plus T. Um, but for the, for this show specifically, uh, it being like this shows specifically what I wanted to do was teach people how to trade regardless of what they're trading."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","316120","318120"," So if you're trading NASDAQ, this works for it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","319120","324120"," Uh, if you're trading S and P 500, uh, it doesn't matter what you're trading."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","324120","325120"," This works for all of it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","326120","329120"," Um, this is the easiest one."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","329120","332120"," Uh, and this is the one that most people trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","332120","336120"," The one thing that I don't want to turn into here to is, um,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","338120","344120"," uh, some people try to gain followers by trading stuff, stuff people are trapped in."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","345120","347120"," Now I don't ever want to be that guy either."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","347120","349120"," I'm not trying to like gain followers here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","349120","352120"," Believe it or not, I'm trying to make people make money."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","353120","359120"," Uh, so I do cover a lot of tickers that are NASDAQ related, uh, when it's appropriate."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","359120","362120"," So you'll, you'll find people here that know that I trade Tesla."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","363120","364120"," Uh, but when I trade Tesla, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","365120","367120"," I only give a signal every month."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","369120","370120"," Two months."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","370120","373120"," Uh, only at the moment to actually buy Tesla."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","374120","378120"," It's like Tesla prime example, like you should have bought it a hundred bucks, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","378120","379120"," Or just after it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","379120","381120"," Uh, you should have bought it at 156 just after it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","382120","387120"," Uh, the rest of the noise from that point forward, I don't really listen to too often."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","387120","392120"," Um, I wait for the next buy signal on those tickers."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","392120","399120"," So for me, at least if you trade that trade NASDAQ, um, there's a bunch of stuff that I do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","399120","400120"," I do still trade that Azdak."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","400120","405120"," So like a lot of the tickers that I give to buy or that I'm buying in my portfolio."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","405120","411120"," Um, are all NASDAQ or mostly NASDAQ, uh, mostly, mostly NQ stuff, but these are proven winners."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","411120","412120"," Like they all have great quarters."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","412120","415120"," They'll have a year of year of sales profits."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","415120","417120"," Um, they're great companies."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","417120","422120"," Um, I don't focus a lot on Fangman plus T, which I should."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","422120","424120"," I just don't have the time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","424120","427120"," I wish I had the time to make a nightly video."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","427120","433120"," So I could cover, um, like always cover Bitcoin, always cover metals, always cover."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","433120","435120"," That takes an extra person to do that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","435120","439120"," Uh, so right now we've got Binky worked on the show on, on Sundays with Winky."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","439120","443120"," Now we've got myself running the live stream during the day."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","443120","446120"," I would fucking love to have a third person."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","446120","453120"," That would cover like all the major indexes, uh, and then cover, uh, Fangman plus T."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","453120","457120"," That alone takes just that alone."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","457120","460120"," That stuff right there takes, uh, about an hour, hour and a half."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","460120","461120"," Every night."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","461120","468120"," So if you're out there watching right now, if you're interested in doing that with me, I can teach you how to do it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","468120","478120"," Uh, and the cool part about it is too, is you can show, uh, the, the up trade, the sideways trade, the down trade and not get caught with, um, being wrong."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","478120","484120"," Uh, just to give a market viewpoint of, Hey, this is where you buy a dip is where you get bearish."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","484120","486120"," Uh, this is where the sideways trade is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","486120","488120"," And, uh, this is where the up trade is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","488120","492120"," What bulls need to do is a bears need to do this with the theta gang needs."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","492120","494120"," If you're out there watching right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","494120","503120"," And, uh, you ever want to join us, we're looking for somebody actively, uh, to do that video to cover, uh, Fangman plus T."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","503120","505120"," Um, and I would work with you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","505120","509120"," I would do live streams of the privately if you wanted, uh, with nobody watching."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","509120","513120"," I would do them live with you every night for a week or two or whatever you want."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","513120","515120"," We are looking for someone to join the team."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","515120","518120"," Uh, it's just not easy for people to do that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","518120","520120"," Like you need to need a computer."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","520120","522120"," A couple computers, probably."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","522120","526120"," Uh, well, on this, on this one, like, if you didn't do a recorded video, if you just did a live stream at nighttime."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","526120","528120"," Uh, for a market recap."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","528120","533120"," And you felt like confident as a, like, can you on your own privately?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","533120","539120"," Could you go through Fangman plus T right now and give, uh, an idea of what you expect?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","539120","541120"," Uh, up down in sideways."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","541120","543120"," If you can do that in like 15 minutes."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","543120","545120"," Quickly every day."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","545120","549120"," Uh, if you think you can do that every day out there, contact me."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","549120","553120"," Uh, I would work with you if you have no experience with live streaming."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","553120","557120"," Uh, if you can do that effectively every day, well, most days."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","557120","560120"," Not every day, but, you know, just generally speaking."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","560120","561120"," You don't have to be right all the time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","561120","563120"," A lot of people are wrong most of the time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","563120","569120"," So if you think you're right most of the time, uh, not eventually right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","569120","572120"," Like you're right most of the time then, uh, give me a shout."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","572120","576120"," Um, more than willing to bring it, bring, uh, add someone to the team."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","576120","578120"," So."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","578120","579120"," It's more time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","579120","580120"," It's very time consuming."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","580120","582120"," It's very stressful."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","582120","586120"," Uh, you need to know a lot to, uh, do that every night."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","586120","588120"," Um, and you probably need access to the tool."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","588120","589120"," Like the tool dude beats everything."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","589120","591120"," It beats all this, like it beats all this shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","591120","593120"," Like beats all."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","593120","597120"," Beats gax beats, uh, beats gamma beats."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","597120","598120"," Just beats all of it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","598120","599120"," So."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","599120","604120"," Once I give you guys, once maybe once I have the tool out, I can give it someone to use."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","604120","608120"," So that, um, they could give those updates every now as forecasts."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","608120","613120"," Uh, cause you can actually see what individual tickers are going to pull back more than others."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","613120","620120"," Um, we're to buy specific tickers where you get, um, uh, long signals, that kind of stuff in short signals."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","624120","626120"," This is by pump room, baby."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","634120","635120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","635120","636120"," So I don't use MAs."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","636120","643120"," Uh, the closest approximation I can give to them is, uh, right now is I got a six AMA right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","643120","646120"," 27 EMA and, uh, normally it's EMA 30."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","646120","650120"," And then an EMA 116 to 129 depends on the day and the week."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","650120","653120"," Right now that's the set to."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","659120","660120"," You'll do it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","661120","671120"," Uh, Connor, send me an email at, um, Connor, send me an email at, uh, Captain Jim James at gmail.com and we can talk, man."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","671120","672120"," Send me an email."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","672120","676120"," And, uh, we'll talk Captain Jim James at gmail.com."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","676120","678120"," And, uh, we'll chat."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","678120","681120"," If you're interested, I'll spend the time with you too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","681120","685120"," If you, I'll spend the time, uh, actively doing this with you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","686120","689120"," Uh, we can do dry runs over and over and over."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","689120","691120"," It's fairly easy to do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","691120","694120"," It's not that it's not as hard as people think it is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","694120","697120"," Uh, we like, just as an example for today."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","697120","698120"," Let's look at tomorrow."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","698120","701120"," So it's, uh, 211 in the afternoon, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","701120","703120"," We don't even know what's going to happen here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","703120","704120"," I'll give you guys exact."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","704120","709120"," So, so if I was on fin to it, break out your notepads."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","712120","714120"," If I was on fin to it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","715120","718120"," And I was giving somebody what to expect."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","721120","722120"," It's fairly simple."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","722120","724120"," It's not as hard as people think it is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","726120","728120"," Uh, it's not as hard."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","729120","733120"," So we know that we just came into a new quarter, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","735120","737120"," We know we came into a new quarter."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","737120","740120"," Um, we have Valhalla up here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","740120","744120"," We know to trade this Valhalla trade, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","745120","747120"," It's a Valhalla trade of 450."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","749120","752120"," We know to trade that we have to trade above this, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","752120","754120"," And we drew this big box in last week."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","756120","757120"," Let's see it right here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","761120","763120"," Fairly simple, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","766120","769120"," It's really, it's really kind of neat because you can be like,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","769120","772120"," give me on like fin to it or some shit or YouTube and be like, you know,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","772120","774120"," bulls weren't able to get above."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","776120","777120"," 444.05, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","777120","778120"," Bulls needed to get up there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","778120","779120"," They couldn't, could they?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","779120","783120"," Sell it down, sell it down, sell it down, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","784120","788120"," Uh, so for bulls, it's kind of funny how you do this stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","792120","793120"," Hold on a second here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","793120","795120"," We do it at SPX for make it easier."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","799120","800120"," So you don't see all the slop."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","808120","810120"," All right, delete the drawings on this page."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","811120","814120"," But we have to put this is all of the, um."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","816120","819120"," This has all of the, um, yeah, delete all the drugs in this chart."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","820120","822120"," This has all of the, um."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","822120","824120"," This has all of the, uh, the what on it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","824120","826120"," Uh, the, the, uh, JPM Morgan, color stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","827120","829120"," I just deleted last, last, last, last quarter's, uh, color stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","829120","830120"," So we're going to go look at this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","830120","831120"," Here's SPX, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","832120","833120"," We had the previous high here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","833120","835120"," We had another gap up high right here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","835120","836120"," Beautiful."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","836120","843120"," We know that the, we know that bulls can see the sellers are here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","843120","845120"," They're telling you, fuck, you know, we're going down, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","846120","847120"," They sold it right here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","847120","848120"," Bam."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","848120","849120"," They sold it right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","849120","850120"," Bam."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","850120","852120"," We're not trading for 50 unless we get above, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","852120","854120"," We know that it's a known, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","854120","857120"," We're not trading for 50 until we get above."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","857120","858120"," Makes sense."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","859120","862120"," And we're not even looking at previous highs here yet."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","862120","864120"," Look at a, uh, daily chart."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","864120","866120"," We'll do it right now together."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","866120","868120"," Make this, we'll make this really simple."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","868120","869120"," Uh."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","869120","872120"," We'll do it right now together."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","872120","874120"," Make this, we'll make this really simple."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","875120","876120"," Uh."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","877120","879120"," So right here, you got a previous high right here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","881120","883120"," You got another previous high right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","883120","884120"," These aren't even the gaps."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","884120","886120"," These are just the previous highs, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","887120","890120"," We know that these, if we break above and hold these, that's bullish."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","893120","894120"," There's the other one right there, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","895120","896120"," We can get closer though."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","897120","898120"," We can look closer."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","901120","902120"," It's right down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","903120","905120"," I'll make it, I'll make it run over here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","906120","907120"," I'm not watching."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","908120","909120"," I should be watching my trade right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","909120","910120"," I'm not."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","911120","912120"," So hold on a second here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","919120","922120"," I got to watch a fucking trade in the background while I'm doing this with you guys at two."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","926120","927120"," Not paying attention."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","927120","928120"," Not good."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","929120","931120"," You guys are trapped me in some shit right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","933120","934120"," Not paying attention to myself."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","934120","935120"," I'm losing money."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","939120","940120"," Yeah, they're trying to sell me down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","940120","941120"," I'm not even paying attention."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","941120","942120"," Look at that shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","942120","944120"," Pay attention to everything, but then when I'm supposed to pay attention to."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","946120","948120"," So I want you to see this here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","948120","949120"," Are you going to gap right here?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","953120","954120"," No real gap right there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","960120","961120"," I'm going to have to get stopped out of this shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","961120","962120"," I'm just going to close this trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","965120","966120"," Pay attention here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","966120","967120"," God damn it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","967120","968120"," You guys got me fucking out."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","968120","970120"," You guys caught me in a, caught me in a stream."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","971120","973120"," Trying to bring somebody on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","973120","974120"," Okay."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","977120","978120"," So just right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","981120","982120"," It's SPX right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","986120","990120"," Bulls need to trade above the previous high of 44, 58, 48."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","991120","992120"," To trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","994120","996120"," 45, 1, 4, 3, 7."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","996120","997120"," Okay."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","997120","998120"," And 44, 8, 9."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","998120","999120"," These are the targets on the high here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1000120","1001120"," Don't want to be red."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1007120","1009120"," It's going to be yellow right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1016120","1017120"," You got to trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1017120","1018120"," You got to keep it above, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1018120","1021120"," To trade this for 51, 4, 3, 7, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1021120","1023120"," You can see the buyers stepped in today though."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1023120","1027120"," We know the sellers were stepping in for quarterly rebalancing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1029120","1030120"," It's on an hourly here for you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1033120","1035120"," You know, we've got to gap the clothes right here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1036120","1040120"," And the other key thing here is that the spy or SPX specifically."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1041120","1042120"," 44, 1, 9."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1056120","1058120"," Right here is the hourly trigger right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1071120","1073120"," This is the hourly trigger right here, okay?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1073120","1075120"," HT on SPX."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1079120","1083120"," We know that bulls are in control if we trade above this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1083120","1084120"," We know it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1084120","1085120"," We already know it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1085120","1090120"," We also have a real, a true range down below here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1090120","1091120"," So I want to show you this too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1091120","1093120"," As you can see."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1094120","1096120"," The buyers pushed us up here to the left, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1096120","1101120"," Push us back up again and they're stepping back in down below here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1101120","1104120"," So we know that demand is here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1113120","1116120"," We know that there's more demand below down here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1127120","1129120"," We also know there's demand down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1129120","1130120"," You can see them buying here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1130120","1132120"," We got a giant gap to fill down below."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1132120","1133120"," This is where Cap wants to fill."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1133120","1135120"," I want to fill all this down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1135120","1137120"," We also know there's some buyers down in here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1137120","1141120"," So just for the rest of today, let's say you were going to do a."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1143120","1144120"," I don't know what the fuck that is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1148120","1150120"," Let's just pretend that we're doing a."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1150120","1155120"," A weekly with what our expectations are, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1159120","1160120"," Weekly what our expectations are."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1160120","1161120"," So on a one minute chart."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1167120","1169120"," Price is below 4409 and SPX."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1169120","1170120"," That's kind of bearish."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1170120","1171120"," It's not bullish."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1172120","1176120"," Five minute chart prices above the five minute, twenty seven EMA."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1177120","1180120"," So I'm kind of bullish on this close here still."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1180120","1183120"," To at least get up here and test this hourly trigger."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1183120","1184120"," See that right there?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1184120","1186120"," Still bullish on closing this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1186120","1189120"," Also, though, heading up here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1189120","1190120"," So what are bulls need to do today?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1190120","1196120"," Bulls need to get above the hourly trigger at 44, 119, 27 to see"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1196120","1202120"," continuation of the upside to at least close the gap above at 44, 45."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1202120","1210120"," Now, there's likely a hidden cell trade in here to the downside."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1210120","1213120"," It's where the sellers are hiding right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1216120","1218120"," I know that you think it's right here, but I don't."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1218120","1219120"," I believe it's above."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1220120","1222120"," This is a bull trap to me."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1224120","1227120"," And that they're not trying to trade this down below."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1227120","1231120"," They're trying to trade it down to 4200."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1231120","1235120"," So if you were to write something or do a video every night."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1235120","1239120"," So there's 15 minutes just on on Spire SPX, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1239120","1241120"," You'd start this with."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1241120","1244120"," You start this with bulls need to trade above."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1244120","1248120"," 4400 for continuation to close the gap above."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1248120","1254120"," And would like to retest that number at 44, 119 for continuation of the upside."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1254120","1255120"," Right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1255120","1257120"," So this is what bulls need to do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1257120","1259120"," They need to trade up here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1259120","1264120"," They need to confirm this and to attack this here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1264120","1266120"," They need that minimum."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1266120","1271120"," And then they need to get above the previous high at 44, 58, 48 to go higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1271120","1274120"," If there's a sideways trade, that's fine for bulls."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1274120","1277120"," As long as they stay above the hourly trigger, everything is fine."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1277120","1278120"," Right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1279120","1281120"," They're getting what do they want?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1281120","1282120"," The sideways trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1282120","1283120"," What do they want?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1283120","1284120"," Right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1284120","1290120"," They want to trade between 43, 88, 75 and this 44, 50 as long as possible."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1290120","1296120"," As a matter of fact, if you were a theta gang, you might think, yeah, this is a great place to put on some theta, a theta trade near, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1296120","1298120"," A sideways trade bears."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1298120","1299120"," What do they want?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1299120","1313120"," Sellers want to reject 44, 119 and better yet, get a new low at 43, 84 so they can begin to attack new lows at 43, 20 down below."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1314120","1315120"," Right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1315120","1322120"," So you like start with that for you start there, but this is where it gets crazy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1322120","1327120"," So if we look at SPX here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1327120","1331120"," We start taking a real look at SPX."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1331120","1333120"," I can already tell you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1333120","1341120"," I can already tell you right now that this is not the place to buy SPX."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1342120","1344120"," I'd like to buy it down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1344120","1350120"," I'd like to buy this one right here with that giant move up there, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1350120","1361120"," So unless spy or SPX, excuse me, resolves itself above, resolves itself above the early trigger, which I don't think it's going to do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1361120","1366120"," And I already see that we're already super max bullish on the daily."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1366120","1368120"," I think we're going to roll over."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1368120","1373120"," I think the trade on SPX is to the downside."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1373120","1375120"," I think you're going to get a rejection here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1375120","1386120"," So if you want my take on what I think is going to happen, my take here is that you're going to get a trap and you're going to trade 43, 48."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1386120","1390120"," Okay, likely even likely even lower."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1390120","1397120"," You're going to get a relief rally here and then you're going to make your way even lower over here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1397120","1400120"," That's what I think."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1400120","1403120"," Because I can see Velo telling me no."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1403120","1407120"," Velo's not at the bottom right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1407120","1420120"," So until it resolves itself above or until SPX resolves itself above 44, 21, 71, I am looking for places to sell the market."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1420120","1422120"," Does that make sense?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1422120","1428120"," So if price can come up here, I'll draw it out for you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1428120","1437120"," So if price at any point can get above and solidate, then yes, we can have continuation to the upside."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1437120","1440120"," There's your green right there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1440120","1442120"," Makes sense?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1442120","1443120"," See it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1444120","1446120"," Continuation above hourly trigger."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1446120","1449120"," But we're not perfect in Velo, are we?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1449120","1451120"," See how down here you see this down here?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1451120","1455120"," This nice low Velo, I always love buying that shit down there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1455120","1458120"," So I expect us to sell down into this daily."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1458120","1461120"," Then I'm looking here in this daily and I'm like, yeah, I don't know, man."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1461120","1465120"," We haven't had a correction a long time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1465120","1469120"," So if we break below this daily trigger here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1469120","1472120"," Let's say a break below this daily trigger and we hold it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1472120","1475120"," Then I'm going to be looking for the weekly."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1475120","1480120"," And I already know that every three or four months, we're going to get a correction."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1480120","1490120"," So if we start to break below and hold one, two, maybe three, four, three, four, that's the next leg down for bears."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1490120","1493120"," And it's likely at 4200."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1493120","1496120"," It's like right there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1496120","1498120"," You know what I'm saying?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1499120","1504120"," That looks kind of funky."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1504120","1507120"," Now the intraday trading stuff means nothing, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1507120","1516120"," But you could probably take this and use this for everything a bull and bear needs and look at this stuff down here and say, yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1516120","1519120"," Probably do for some kind of corrective move here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1519120","1521120"," The down move is likely not over."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1521120","1526120"," We're likely going to trade down to 4340."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1527120","1532120"," And there's a possibility that we're going to go all the way down and trade this weekly trigger."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1532120","1534120"," We normally do it in a bull market bull runs."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1534120","1535120"," That's what we normally do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1535120","1544120"," Now, if we resolve to the upside at any point, we resolve above 44, 20, 277 bulls."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1544120","1549120"," If you can do that to get above and hold it, we will continue higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1549120","1553120"," Does that make sense?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1553120","1555120"," You guys understand what I'm saying now?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1555120","1563120"," If you want to do videos with me, we can literally write this stuff every day and review it every day."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1563120","1566120"," We could literally put this on a chart like this, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1566120","1573120"," And watch price every day and give a review every day to say, hey, bulls are now winning."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1573120","1575120"," We're above the early trigger."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1575120","1576120"," You know what happens?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1576120","1577120"," We get above the early trigger?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1577120","1578120"," We fucking blast off."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1578120","1580120"," We moon that shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1580120","1582120"," We get below the early trigger."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1582120","1583120"," What are we doing?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1583120","1584120"," We're selling it, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1584120","1588120"," We're selling it, selling it, selling it until we find a bottom and fellow."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1588120","1589120"," Does that make sense?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1589120","1603120"," As soon as you start seeing Velo come up, you can then say to a seller, hey, man, I know we're continuing down right now, but we're going to start looking for a bottom to buy a dip to buy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1603120","1606120"," Start, start cashing out down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1606120","1608120"," We're getting close."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1608120","1610120"," Does that make sense?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1611120","1613120"," And start looking for a turn higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1615120","1616120"," It's kind of neat."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1616120","1622120"," So even right where we are right now in the market right here, I'm expecting sellers to come in."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1622120","1623120"," That's what I'm expecting."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1623120","1624120"," Sellers."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1626120","1632120"," They're going to try to step in here and they're going to try to tee off on you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1633120","1637120"," Now, if they fail, you'll see, we'll squeeze above it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1637120","1639120"," We'll hold it and start going higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1639120","1644120"," We can probably take a long trade for, you know, a week or two, three weeks, something like that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1644120","1647120"," And it's usually a beautiful fucking thing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1647120","1649120"," Like rockets, dude."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1649120","1655120"," So until that happens, you know, do you get what I'm saying?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1656120","1663120"," This is part of that trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1663120","1666120"," Bam, bam, bam, we're down again."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1666120","1669120"," And how do I know in here how to get long again?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1669120","1671120"," Watch my cursor here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1673120","1675120"," You'll see it right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1678120","1683120"," Price will begin to, let's say we bounce off this yellow line right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1684120","1685120"," Every bounce, boom."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1685120","1687120"," Price will begin to recover."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1689120","1691120"," It'll actually confirm the leg is higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1692120","1694120"," And that's the long trade right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1696120","1697120"," Make sense?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1697120","1702120"," So if we don't even go down to that weekly, but we recover and confirm it on the daily trigger,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1702120","1705120"," we know we can then, with confidence, take that, take a long again."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1706120","1707120"," Correction over."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1707120","1708120"," We didn't get down to the weekly."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1708120","1709120"," We're moving on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1709120","1710120"," Let's go higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1711120","1713120"," That's on the 15th of the month, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1713120","1714120"," Here's the 12th."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1714120","1715120"," Here's the 17th."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1715120","1716120"," You see it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1717120","1722120"," So when I say, yeah, expect this correction to last in the 15th, 19th, 20th."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1722120","1727120"," Regardless of where price is, I know it's going to end somewhere in that timeframe."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1728120","1731120"," Or I have a good idea that it's going to end around then."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1733120","1735120"," Like that's the worst case scenario."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1736120","1741120"," So now just going back to this chart that we're looking at here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1742120","1743120"," Kind of weird, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1745120","1750120"," Now you're just looking at this candlestick chart and everyone out there has got all these special things, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1750120","1751120"," They got decks."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1751120","1752120"," They got gamma."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1752120","1753120"," They got, I don't fucking know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1753120","1758120"," They got like, they got a volume profile, market profile."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1758120","1759120"," They got news."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1759120","1760120"," They got all this stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1760120","1762120"," And I really don't fucking care."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1762120","1764120"," I care about price."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1764120","1767120"," If price gets above here, I know we're off and running."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1767120","1769120"," If it holds, I know we're off and running."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1769120","1773120"," I know if price rejects and we start heading down, what that means."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1773120","1777120"," And I know that I have a high probability of winning most of those trades."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1791120","1792120"," Turn a five minute chart right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1792120","1798120"," We still have not broken below the five minute here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1798120","1800120"," Now there is a problem here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1800120","1805120"," The more time we spend doing this kind of shit here, check and check and recheck."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1805120","1806120"," Check it again."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1806120","1807120"," Check it again right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1807120","1809120"," It can be bullish or bearish."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1809120","1813120"," This could be dealers right now that don't want to pay to, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1813120","1816120"," Dealers will come in here and fuck up shit and then we make the move higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1817120","1818120"," Go back."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1818120","1820120"," Maybe we trade this in the overnight."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1820120","1822120"," You lose on options."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1822120","1824120"," We get the price that we want."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1824120","1825120"," Then we get the sell."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1825120","1831120"," So for me right now, still as a seller, then I'm going to give it to you one more time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1831120","1834120"," The next sell is still above at 440."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1834120","1837120"," That's what the next sell is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1837120","1845120"," If you're, if you're a bear on spy, your next sell still is below 438.90."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1846120","1848120"," Fourth, you have this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1848120","1853120"," If you're a bear, you want to sell 438.90 or you're going to be selling 440.97ish somewhere"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1853120","1854120"," in there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1854120","1860120"," It'll come down overnight, but for right now, for us right now at this moment on price,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1860120","1863120"," you still don't have a sell."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1863120","1870120"," You still don't have a high probability trade to the downside where we are right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1870120","1873120"," You still don't have it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1873120","1875120"," They lost the trade right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1875120","1886120"," To win that trade, they have to trade below the 30 EMA and close below the 30 EMA and a"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1886120","1887120"," five minute chart."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1887120","1891120"," So you still don't have a trade here if you're a seller."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1891120","1892120"," No trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1896120","1898120"," Hey, what's up, Etrad insurance?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1898120","1899120"," How you doing, brother?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1901120","1902120"," Good to see you, man."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1902120","1910120"," Yeah, they do, don't they?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1910120","1915120"," Yeah, they do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1915120","1921120"," And you still don't have a trade as a seller right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1921120","1922120"," You have no confirmed trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1922120","1926120"," As a matter of fact, if you sold that and close it, you're getting smoked right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1926120","1931120"," There's still no trade for a seller here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1932120","1934120"," We have to do a video."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1934120","1939120"," We have to do like a video in the at nighttime or this weekend or something where we make"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1939120","1943120"," an actual, this is what this means and this is what that means."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1943120","1950120"," But I would love to have somebody come help because if I could spend time with you,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1950120","1952120"," we can, I can review it with you over and over."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1952120","1954120"," And I matter of fact, I have the white paper."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1954120","1955120"," I'll just give it to you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1955120","1960120"," Like here, you read this, you read this and it'll explain it all."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1961120","1969120"," It's fairly simple."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1969120","1973120"," Weak sellers."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1973120","1976120"," I love saying that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1976120","1981120"," Probable bull trap still to the upside up here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1982120","1990120"," I need someone every day."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1990120","1992120"," Not every day."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1992120","1998120"," I need someone willing to do a Sunday night or you don't need to do Sunday night."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","1998120","2003120"," I can teach you how to do it on Friday and it's it works for Monday."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2003120","2006120"," Fairly, fairly, fairly good at this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2007120","2010120"," But if you wanted to do it like Sunday night through Thursday."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2010120","2012120"," So Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2012120","2015120"," People want to people want to recap video every night."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2015120","2017120"," They want the full package."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2017120","2020120"," They want like they want a weekend stock show."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2020120","2028120"," They want a fake man plus tea, Bitcoin, Vicks, twos and tens or gold."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2028120","2030120"," All that stuff's easy to do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2030120","2031120"," It's all easy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2031120","2035120"," Like they want to look at silver and gold and they want to look at Dixie and they want to"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2035120","2036120"," look at Vicks."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2036120","2037120"," People like that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2037120","2040120"," They would like to be assured of that stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2040120","2042120"," Now they want to know what it means."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2042120","2048120"," But in reality, we need something for us because what we're trading is making money."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2048120","2050120"," We're trading what hedge funds trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2050120","2051120"," I don't know if you know that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2051120","2053120"," We're not trading when retail trades."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2053120","2055120"," We're doing what the hedge funds do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2055120","2058120"," I don't know if you know that or not, but that's what we're fucking doing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2058120","2061120"," We're trading with professionals trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2061120","2064120"," So that's different."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2065120","2070120"," So I need an extra person to help with it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2070120","2074120"," And if we can do it over the course of two or three weeks,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2074120","2079120"," then I get you access to the tool with no, you know, you get your own tool for anyone else."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2079120","2081120"," Then we go out there and make these videos at nighttime."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2081120","2084120"," It's going to help people because I assure you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2084120","2088120"," My public presence on Fintuit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2089120","2092120"," Oftentimes revolves around."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2094120","2097120"," A lot of fintuit, not knowing where bottoms and tops are."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2098120","2101120"," Most of the time, not all the time, but like 70% of the time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2101120","2107120"," Like where a lot of people get trapped long or short is where I know they're going to get fucked up."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2107120","2109120"," It's generally speaking."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2109120","2112120"," It's fairly easy to see."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2112120","2116120"," Regularly on a regular basis over time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2119120","2122120"," So we have to be that for retailers."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2122120","2124120"," And I don't, we're getting to a point."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2124120","2127120"," We're very close right now to where we might just make this whole thing private."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2127120","2129120"," It's pretty close."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2129120","2131120"," The whole thing just goes private."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2131120","2133120"," We don't even have a public presence anymore."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2133120","2134120"," It's fair."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2134120","2135120"," We're close."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2135120","2139120"," I don't know if we can continue to be public at some point."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2139120","2141120"," Depends on, depends on how this goes."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2141120","2146120"," So it might just be a small, a close group."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2146120","2150120"," But even then I still want to do the videos."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2150120","2157120"," For us so that we can trade this for a year."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2157120","2163120"," There's a fascinating thing that we're doing so."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2163120","2166120"," Yeah, you keep the edge quiet so nobody knows."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2166120","2172120"," So you do a daily stream for just the private group."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2172120","2173120"," It just be us."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2173120","2174120"," Nobody else."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2175120","2176120"," It's still have it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2176120","2177120"," It would just be us."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2177120","2180120"," It just be no more like no more public persona."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2180120","2181120"," Which is fine."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2181120","2184120"," I don't know if we're going to do that, but I think it's probably."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2184120","2189120"," I think I think it's probably."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2196120","2198120"," It's it's definitely like a."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2198120","2201120"," It's definitely we're at a place where."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2202120","2204120"," There's no need."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2204120","2205120"," So."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2205120","2207120"," We'll see."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2213120","2216120"," Yeah, just send me, send me an email to my Gmail."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2216120","2219120"," Not to my website email address."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2219120","2220120"," We got a bunch of stuff coming out."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2220120","2223120"," So over the weekend, we're talking to the devs and stuff and seeing where we are."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2223120","2224120"," We're headed."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2224120","2226120"," Which way we're going."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2232120","2233120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2233120","2234120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2234120","2235120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2235120","2236120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2236120","2237120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2237120","2238120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2238120","2239120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2239120","2240120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2240120","2241120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2241120","2242120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2242120","2243120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2243120","2244120"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2244120","2245120"," If you guys are interested, let me know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2245120","2246120"," And."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2246120","2250120"," You know, if you ever want to start your own thing, if you ever wanted to do your own thing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2250120","2254120"," And you just want to work with somebody else or whatever, we can do that too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2254120","2255120"," This."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2255120","2259120"," This whole entire project is focused on retail traders."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2260120","2263120"," And there's been never been a change."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2263120","2265120"," It's."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2265120","2267120"," Whether it works or it doesn't work."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2267120","2278120"," I don't know, but I don't know if it works to where it could be self-sustaining, but this project still is based on helping retail traders."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2278120","2282120"," Have an edge."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2283120","2290120"," Like literally have an edge while you have an edge on everybody else."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2290120","2295120"," And I know you, I know you motherfuckers are out there paying people like hundreds of dollars every month for no edge."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2295120","2297120"," I know you are."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2297120","2299120"," I know what you do."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2678120","2684120"," Yeah, I was wondering, Binky, if there's a sideways day tomorrow and then we go down."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2753120","2755120"," Your PT four is the red bar."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2757120","2763120"," And then your next probable your actual the probable bull trap is higher for 40 97."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2764120","2767120"," That should be the next trade down."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2768120","2770120"," Check on spy real quick."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2774120","2782120"," Yeah, it's still up here."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2808120","2810120"," That's so much that's not so much selling."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2810120","2817120"," I like the idea of the rotation trade into middle of July, not middle, but like the 15th and 19th."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2817120","2819120"," It's not really selling."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2819120","2821120"," It's more rotation."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2822120","2825120"," I like the idea of finishing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2825120","2829120"," Now July is normally a positive month."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2842120","2846120"," We thought a lot of volatility, so I know I'm saying that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2846120","2851120"," I'm saying that I want to see that weakness in July,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2851120","2854120"," but we didn't have a very volatile June either."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2858120","2860120"," So even if it's like sideways and down,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2860120","2863120"," it doesn't necessarily be like doom and destruction."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2863120","2868120"," I just like the idea of like two weeks of rotation,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2868120","2871120"," and then we make our way higher for the rest of the quarter."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2891120","2898120"," I'm going to trade S3 right now at 44.03,"

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","2964120","2974120"," into the 19th on Vexpiration."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3374120","3383120"," Can the bulls do it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3383120","3403120"," Come on, 440 C's."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3404120","3405120"," Four minutes left."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3405120","3407120"," We're going to find out if we get the sideways trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3407120","3413120"," If we get the down trade, if we get the up trade."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3413120","3417120"," If they roll it, we'll look for this trade tomorrow."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3417120","3432120"," Don't get trapped in here if stops in your calls."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3432120","3442120"," We're going to find out what's going on here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3442120","3451120"," We're going to find out what's going on here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3451120","3471120"," We're going to find out what's going on here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3471120","3481120"," Three minutes left."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3481120","3483120"," Dude, I got to get a picture of my feet for you guys."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3483120","3484120"," They're all fucked up."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3484120","3487120"," I got like poison ivy, poison oak."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3487120","3492120"," I got like bug bites all over my ankles."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3492120","3497120"," We're like river rock rash."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3497120","3507120"," 440, 10, just then."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3528120","3538120"," We're going to address that in just a moment."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3538120","3541120"," You can see 45 46 hundred this month."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3541120","3542120"," I can too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3542120","3545120"," You need to get above this to get it though."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3545120","3551120"," Cannot see it unless you get above this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3551120","3556120"," You cannot see 46 hundred without being above 4100."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3556120","3559120"," Guaranteed."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3559120","3561120"," You have to be above the hourly trigger."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3561120","3566120"," You don't have a choice."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3566120","3569120"," There is no trade up there unless we're above it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3569120","3570120"," None."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3570120","3573120"," You must be above it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3573120","3576120"," You don't have a choice."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3576120","3580120"," It's the only way that we get up there, believe it or not."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3581120","3593120"," The only way for bulls to see 45 or 46 hundred is for us to be trading above 4400."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3593120","3599120"," Otherwise, we're in a corrective action period."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3599120","3604120"," We need bulls buying calls."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3604120","3618120"," We need bulls to believe."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3618120","3620120"," I see it on the quarter."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3620120","3633120"," I don't see it on the monthly until we get above 4400."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3633120","3635120"," Dude, pretty stacks dude."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3635120","3637120"," If you're watching right now, pretty stacks."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3652120","3654120"," Three o'clock power hour, baby."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3654120","3658120"," Where are we going?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3658120","3662120"," Yeah, I got to take a picture for Joe right now and set him."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3662120","3666120"," Dude, I got like my feet are kind of banged up too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3666120","3678120"," I got like bruising and shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3678120","3682120"," I have to send Joey."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3682120","3685120"," I bet there's a hedge fund right now looking at me right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3685120","3687120"," I bet there's a hedge fund out there, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3687120","3691120"," That motherfucker wrote weak sellers here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3691120","3715120"," Oh, yeah, baby."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3715120","3716120"," Here's the cross right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3716120","3718120"," Here's the cross right here, baby, right here."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3726120","3744120"," Bull playing, baby."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3744120","3748120"," Here's your retest of it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3774120","3790120"," Oh, yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3790120","3794120"," Did I go looking shark?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3794120","3797120"," He's kind of fucked up."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3797120","3802120"," He's got some jaw teeth."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3802120","3807120"," And he's swimming right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3807120","3831120"," He's coming right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3831120","3834120"," What else we got?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3834120","3835120"," I need more."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3835120","3839120"," I need to get new music."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3839120","3859120"," What up Diego Garza?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3859120","3861120"," You guys miss me out there?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3861120","3868120"," You like having me back to make some free money?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3868120","3876120"," I missed you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3898120","3900120"," You want to see my feet?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3900120","3902120"," Hold on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3902120","3903120"," I'm going to take a picture of them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3903120","3908120"," Hold on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3928120","3938120"," I'm going to take a picture of them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3938120","3943120"," I'm going to take a picture of them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3943120","3951120"," I'm going to take a picture of them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3951120","3956120"," I'm going to take a picture of them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3956120","3961120"," I'm going to take a picture of them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3961120","3966120"," I'm going to take the nylious picture I can take."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3966120","3969120"," That's how banged up they got."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3969120","3975120"," Damn, look at those things."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3975120","3977120"," This is the top of my feet."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3977120","3980120"," Let me take a picture of the bottom two."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3980120","3985120"," Hold on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","3985120","4000120"," Hey, puncture wounds in the bottom of my feet too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4000120","4003120"," I'm going to set them to Joe."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4003120","4018120"," Hold on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4018120","4023120"," Hold on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4023120","4031120"," I'm actually in a trade right now and I make sure we're doing this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4031120","4040120"," If you're a bull, be careful of being trapped in here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4040120","4044120"," You know, the other thing that's a problem here too,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4044120","4049120"," these fucking sellers, man, and I'm a seller too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4049120","4053120"," You know what they're going to try to do, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4053120","4055120"," It's trappy in here and then bring this down overnight and then"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4055120","4058120"," send you lower."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4058120","4071400"," like into this bell you could have like some um euphoria and they're trapping you for tomorrow"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4071400","4076360"," so let's look at that real quick yeah they're trying to sell right now they're pissy they're"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4076360","4082440"," stinky they want their sell earlier dude these fucking bears why are you so early why is a bear"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4082440","4089800"," so fucking early like why can't you just like chill like they're always early like you never"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4089800","4093640"," see them right now they don't care they're just like we're selling man we we're not waiting"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4094520","4104280"," just like can you just give it a minute they're always early"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4111640","4115560"," always early it's always like early"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4116120","4124680"," just have patience you're a seller just have fucking patience"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4132520","4139240"," hey do your vent this is little care i've seen i've done it as a seller i've done it"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4139240","4158120"," just straight revenge trading oh see that weak seller's bro i already ran him over"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4169240","4181240"," so"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4181240","4199160"," and"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4199160","4200720"," so like select right here, I think the thought process here"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4200720","4207440"," I think the process or I think the idea here is that they're trying to pin this so the"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4207440","4209960"," hourly comes down and pushes them down."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4209960","4215440"," So let's take a look at, let's look at this PX real quick."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4215440","4218800"," I mean it's close, it's pretty fucking close."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4218800","4224880"," I see what they're trying to do, they're trying to fucking trap it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4231720","4239720"," There's still room though, there's still like a tiny bit of upside here, but it's really close."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4241720","4244720"," Let me bring this over for you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4244720","4251720"," I mean it's close to hand grenades and horseshoes, this is SPX, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4255720","4259720"," Nope, no, no, no, come on now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4260720","4262720"," I mean it's so close."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4266720","4271720"," And I'll go over the JPM call already this weekend too, well do a show this weekend."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4271720","4277720"," I mean they're trying right here, you can see on this green bar, this is a 30 minute chart right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4277720","4281720"," They're trying to sell this right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4281720","4288720"," And you know the trying already, they just don't care, like place my trade and leave, they're early."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4289720","4294720"," I think you get one more green bar up here, then comes the real sell up here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4295720","4300720"," But if not right, they don't really care because when we come into tomorrow,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4300720","4307720"," their plan is on Friday to sell it and have a bloodbath Friday in store for you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4307720","4313720"," So I don't think that they care, we're so close right now that they don't care."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4314720","4321720"," Now ES, same kind of deal here, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4321720","4326720"," So here's ES chart in a 30 minute chart, they're like we don't care."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4326720","4335720"," If I was trading ES though, if I was trading ES, I want you to know that you don't have the one in five minute on your side."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4335720","4339720"," So you don't have this on your side."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4339720","4342720"," So we're still likely going higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4342720","4351720"," If you wanted a place to short ES, I'm telling you it's higher, it's like it's here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4351720","4358720"," It's like somewhere in here, and then the break below, and then you're like shortest fuck right there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4358720","4361720"," It's not where we are right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4361720","4365720"," So I'm still with, I'm still with the bulls on this one."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4365720","4370720"," For the moment, I'm with the bulls."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4370720","4374720"," There is something to be said for where we are right now for the bulls."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4374720","4379720"," If you're trading futures, this shit is ready to rip to the upside."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4379720","4382720"," Like this is bullish, not bearish."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4382720","4384720"," I want to show you this right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4384720","4385720"," Can we go lower?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4385720","4389720"," Yes, but this is like, let's like get the fuck out of the way."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4389720","4390720"," This is where you like selling right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4390720","4391720"," See it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4391720","4393720"," CES, you're selling this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4393720","4396720"," You're like maxing out up here, you're taking your money and running."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4396720","4398720"," Roll it lower."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4398720","4403720"," And now it's kind of looking like at least $44.58."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4403720","4411720"," So it depends on what your poison is here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4411720","4414720"," I'm trying to sell it down right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4414720","4419720"," What's funny is that ES is going up as spy is going down."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4419720","4425720"," So ES is still going up right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4426720","4428720"," It's a little bit of a roll here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4428720","4433720"," But it's more way more dramatic right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4433720","4435720"," In spy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4435720","4438720"," They're laying it on thick."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4438720","4440720"," In spy right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4440720","4441720"," They're trying."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4441720","4444720"," They're going to get run the fuck over though, so, or my view there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4444720","4446720"," Or, or ES is going to go to the moon."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4446720","4449720"," In spy won't."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4449720","4454720"," Yeah, that's what I'm looking at right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4454720","4455720"," I'm looking at ES right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4455720","4458720"," And ES is like we're here to go higher."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4458720","4465720"," So ES says a divergence right now, a major divergence to the price of spy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4465720","4467720"," So spy is down looking ugly, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4467720","4471720"," ES is like ready to explode to the upside."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4471720","4482720"," And it's got two green bars where spy has red bars."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4483720","4486720"," All this doom here in spy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4486720","4488720"," What do you tell me?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4488720","4492720"," You tell me ES is going to fucking tell me ES is going up 4458."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4492720","4494720"," And what you're not going to let the spy go up there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4494720","4496720"," Is that what you're trying to tell me?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4496720","4498720"," It's so much doom."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4498720","4501720"," So much divergence right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4501720","4502720"," So salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4502720","4504720"," Salty weak sellers right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4504720","4506720"," Super salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4512720","4514720"," Salty salty salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4514720","4520720"," Super salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4520720","4526720"," That's what the bull trap is right up there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4526720","4527720"," Right up there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4527720","4528720"," It's not down here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4528720","4536720"," It's up there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4536720","4541720"," So salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4541720","4546720"," That's odd."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4546720","4550720"," My five minute chart on VIX is saying there is no gap down below."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4550720","4551720"," Yeah, there it is right there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4551720","4553720"," There's my fucking gap."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4553720","4557720"," Giant fucking gap on fucking VIX."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4557720","4564720"," Gap to 1425."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4564720","4565720"," Salty bears, man."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4565720","4566720"," So salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4566720","4567720"," So touchy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4567720","4568720"," I don't know why."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4568720","4570720"," Just short this right here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4570720","4571720"," It's too easy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4571720","4583720"," It's too fucking easy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4583720","4590720"," So salty."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4590720","4594720"," I guess the only thing that I could think of here would be if there was a pin into the"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4595720","4596720"," close here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4596720","4600720"," And then they would get, if you get the pin into the close, then you get the hourly coming"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4600720","4601720"," down."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4601720","4604720"," And that's where the roll is down there."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4604720","4608720"," They could try some smooth, they could try in here."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","4608720","4613720"," It could be like some kind of like, I think it closer to the close on these days."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5222420","5223420"," How about this?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5223420","5226420"," Do you smell the migration like the do you see it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5226420","5227420"," Because I see it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5227420","5230420"," I don't know where it's to though."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5230420","5234420"," Normally you can see where everyone's going."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5237420","5238420"," Yeah, that's true too."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5250420","5251420"," You think Elon's going to win it?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5251420","5253420"," Yeah, I don't know if he does or doesn't."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5253420","5257420"," I think the only way I in my view how Elon wins it is he declares bankruptcy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5258420","5260420"," I think he declares chapter 11."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5260420","5264420"," They were organized and he washes all that debt."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5266420","5268420"," It's very common to do that, right? Something like that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5272420","5273420"," Oh, yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5273420","5274420"," So I was a dig user."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5274420","5275420"," I was a FARC user."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5275420","5277420"," So FARC led into dig, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5278420","5280420"," And then dig ran into Reddit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5283420","5284420"," Right."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5284420","5286420"," And then Reddit's now fucking the shit show."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5288420","5291420"," You're like, if you can go that far back, then you know about all these different."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5294420","5296420"," I don't know what the Reddit alternative is either."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5300420","5303420"," I don't know that it's decentralized."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5303420","5307420"," The one good thing about these platforms is their ease of use."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5308420","5309420"," Like we know that, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5309420","5312420"," Dig was like that too a long time ago. FARC was the same way."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5312420","5316420"," Like you have like the key points here is ease of use, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5316420","5317420"," It's always ease of use."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5319420","5323420"," Some form of freedom to do whatever you want."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5325420","5329420"," As long as you're not trying to kill people and stuff or yourself."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5331420","5334420"," And then there's some kind of like nonprofit motive."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5335420","5340420"," Like make just enough to make money to keep it running and then."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5344420","5349420"," Yeah, I think he's of use is in this case, it's ease of use is critical."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5352420","5357420"," And you in the other thing, you know, I think if there was one platform that could do it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5358420","5359420"," I think it's still discord."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5360420","5363420"," I think of discord had like an open road."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5365420","5369420"," It would probably be the probably be the."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5655420","5657420"," That is being used by."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5658420","5660420"," A grass roots community."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5661420","5663420"," But it's not planned."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5664420","5666420"," It's really 10 trade and sense sense right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5668420","5669420"," So I want to be clear on this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5670420","5671420"," Like the one thing about blue sky."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5672420","5673420"," Like what I like about blue sky is."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5677420","5679420"," Like we're letting like it's really bizarre."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5680420","5681420"," Like we've turned into this thing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5681420","5682420"," Listen here closely."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5682420","5683420"," We want you to hear this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5684420","5685420"," Okay, it's very important."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5686420","5688420"," When I was a young guy, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5689420","5691420"," It's a very important thing for me to explain this to you."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5692420","5693420"," I'm going to just close these things up."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5695420","5697420"," I want to want to be very clear with you guys on something."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5698420","5701420"," When I was a young guy, right, I used to throw a raves."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5703420","5706420"," And I was in high school at that time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5707420","5708420"," And I was a soccer player."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5709420","5711420"," I was like, uh, you know, like good in school."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5711420","5713420"," But it wasn't like it wasn't smart as kidding."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5713420","5714420"," It wasn't dumbass."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5715420","5717420"," And the people I hung out with though, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5719420","5721420"," We were like the tastemakers without people knowing it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5722420","5724420"," So in high school, they didn't know what we did."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5726420","5728420"," But you had people that you had like literally people getting hired."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5730420","5734420"," To find kids that were doing something that wasn't in the mainstream."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5735420","5737420"," So this is music that's not in the mainstream scene."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5738420","5740420"," A look that all that stuff became popular."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5741420","5743420"," Years and years and years later, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5744420","5749420"," Oftentimes today, you will see a lot of this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5750420","5751420"," It's something that's new."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5752420","5753420"," It gets crafted."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5754420","5755420"," It's not organic."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5756420","5757420"," They'll play it off as being organic."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5758420","5764420"," They'll be like, yeah, we brought over this famous, this and this famous, that and this trusted person."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5765420","5768420"," And they're helping us with this new thing we want you to buy into."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5769420","5771420"," And it usually doesn't work."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5772420","5775420"," It needs to be organic."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5776420","5781420"," And I want maybe we should be asking 18 year olds and 17 year olds or 16 year olds."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5782420","5786420"," Because they probably know more than we any of us could do or create this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5788420","5791420"," For like social media, I'm talking about usually in the past."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5792420","5796420"," When you get that migration, it typically happens to a place."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5796420","5804420"," That wasn't like christened or crowned by, I don't know, fucking pomp or fucking, you name them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5805420","5807420"," Like you pick them anywhere out there, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5808420","5810420"," It's not normally it's like it's natural."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5811420","5813420"," And a lot of the alternatives right now are not natural."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5814420","5817420"," They're like, we want you to come here and help create this next place."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5819420","5823420"," And like not like Reddit, dig, FARC, all those places, Yahoo, Masters boards."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5824420","5829420"," It just kind of just took off on its own Facebook to even some extent in my space too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5829420","5830420"," It just kind of happened."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5832420","5834420"," And I'm flat right now just heads up."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5834420","5836420"," I got some god monthly puts on the market, but."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5837420","5841420"," In terms of zero dates and flat, but just just think about that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5842420","5846420"," If it's not a natural migration, it's not already being done."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5846420","5847420"," That's my point here is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5848420","5850420"," Is there any place out there any social media?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5850420","5852420"," The only thing I could think of would be TikTok."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5854420","5857420"," I know we make fun of it all day long, but."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5858420","5859420"," It might be TikTok."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5860420","5862420"," Or it might be a VR world or something."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5862420","5863420"," I don't know, but."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5869420","5871420"," Yeah, no, no, no, it's not truth social."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5871420","5872420"," It's not D.W.A.C."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5873420","5874420"," It's not either."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5874420","5879420"," So those are all with the pro not problem, but a lot of these places that are being offered are like."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5879420","5882420"," You're being trapped into it into an echo chamber."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5882420","5886420"," Whatever echo chamber you like to be in so you can scream at each other and."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5886420","5887420"," You all agree with each other."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5887420","5889420"," That's a lot of what's being offered up right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5891420","5893420"," Where people are trapped people with power like."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5893420","5897420"," You've got like these big egos out there that are like here come to my Twitter."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5897420","5900420"," Here come to my Twitter here come to my Twitter, you know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5901420","5903420"," I smell the migration."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5903420","5904420"," I just don't know where it is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5905420","5909420"," It's not normally to a place that's been christened as the place to go."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5910420","5912420"," When you're the first person there, it's normal."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5912420","5913420"," You kind of just know it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5913420","5916420"," It's usually very young people that know it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5918420","5920420"," So what we think might be the heir parents."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5921420","5925420"," Or like you and I might think that Twitter is the future or X is the future."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5926420","5928420"," I know that like TikTok sucks."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5929420","5931420"," I know the child China thing I get all that, but."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5932420","5935420"," It would not it would not shock me to see like news starting to come out of."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5936420","5937420"," TikTok like real time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5938420","5939420"," Stuff like that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5939420","5940420"," I don't know if it's TikTok."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5940420","5941420"," I don't know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5941420","5942420"," I'm not saying it is TikTok."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5942420","5945420"," I'm saying that it's usually something like that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5947420","5948420"," No, no, no, it's not Mastodon."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5948420","5949420"," It's not Mastodon."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5949420","5950420"," It's not Blue Sky."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5951420","5952420"," It's not any of those things."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5952420","5954420"," Those are likely not the place."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5956420","5958420"," It could be, but it's likely not."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5966420","5967420"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5970420","5974420"," Yeah, I want if you're older person and you think back to all of the migrations."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5976420","5979420"," Every migration was to something that nobody was paying attention to."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5979420","5981420"," It was it was very natural."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5983420","5984420"," No one had to talk you into it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5984420","5985420"," You're just like, Oh, this is awesome."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5985420","5986420"," I kind of like this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5987420","5988420"," Like you made that community."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5991420","5993420"," Let's go full circle back to print media."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5996420","5997420"," I'm fascinated by it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","5997420","5999420"," I'm interested to find out what it is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6000420","6001420"," Hey, MZT tech."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6013420","6015420"," That it's likely going to be discord."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6020420","6022420"," Yeah, 4chan had a possibility of being that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6023420","6024420"," I was a 4chan member."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6024420","6026420"," I was a B board member, but way back in the day."

"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6050420","6053420"," Do you guys remember that time way back in like 2012?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6054420","6059420"," Like when that company tried to do Twitter posts rolling in their events."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6059420","6061420"," It wasn't like this big event space."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6063420","6067420"," And like B board like started launching like, Hey, if you make this tweet right now,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6067420","6070420"," it's going to show up for like 50,000 people to see."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6070420","6072420"," And they found out all the people that are running the event."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6073420","6074420"," Was it Triago or something?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6075420","6076420"," Triago or Tiago, I forget."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6077420","6079420"," Yeah, do you remember that shit?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6080420","6081420"," Do you remember the whole?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6081420","6082420"," Yeah, dude, exactly."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6082420","6084420"," Do you remember that shit that shit was crazy?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6087420","6089420"," Yeah, of course they take over the racism."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6090420","6095420"," Well, you know, used to not be there was even a time when it was more to piss off Karens and stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6095420","6097420"," It wasn't to actually be racist."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6098420","6100420"," It was more about trolling people."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6100420","6103420"," Now, of course, people are drinking that shit and that's what they are, but."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6104420","6106420"," It was kind of innocent back then, in my view."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6107420","6109420"," It wasn't there was no intent."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6113420","6116420"," I'm just fascinated by the whole whenever it happens, wherever it happens to."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6117420","6122420"," I think the best company set up for it is likely if they can transform would likely be discord."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6123420","6125420"," They probably have the most like."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6127420","6129420"," They're quiet in the background."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6129420","6130420"," Let's do whatever you want."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6131420","6133420"," But they're not set up, of course, for it to happen."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6135420","6136420"," Because you need that public."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6137420","6140420"," You need that ease of access, which discord and you need to see everything."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6141420","6143420"," Like, oh, today I'm, oh, look at this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6143420","6144420"," There's like stitching and bitching."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6145420","6147420"," I can go over there and find out what are the stitching bitches bitches do."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6148420","6149420"," Oh, what does this guy do?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6149420","6151420"," Oh, how to eat erasers."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6152420","6154420"," I'm going to go check out that sub, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6154420","6155420"," All they do is eat erasers."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6155420","6156420"," Let's check it out."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6157420","6158420"," Like exploring and finding cool stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6163420","6165420"," That's another side of it too, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6165420","6170420"," The writing bots back in the day to help spam votes in 2012 for pit bull to show up."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6170420","6171420"," Yeah, remember that?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6171420","6173420"," Remember the pit bull showing up to Walmart Alaska?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6173420","6174420"," Dude, I remember that shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6180420","6181420"," Yeah, you know what?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6181420","6182420"," I think discord has to transform."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6183420","6184420"," I think it has to transform."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6184420","6186420"," It has to make that, that, that transformation."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6186420","6188420"," I don't think discord is it right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6188420","6190420"," I think they have the ability to become it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6194420","6195420"," Did I remember that?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6195420","6198420"," I remember that pit bull stuff like send him up to Alaska to Walmart."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6198420","6199420"," Do they did that?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6199420","6201420"," Remember body McBoat face?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6201420","6203420"," Like you guys remember all that shit, right?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6203420","6205420"," They just start running all these contests and stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6205420","6207420"," Which contest can we win next?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6215420","6216420"," Maybe Twitch."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6216420","6217420"," I don't know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6217420","6223420"," I think, um, I think Twitch has its place."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6223420","6229420"," But I think that, like I'm talking about real time dissemination of information."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6229420","6232420"," Reddit was really good at some of that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6232420","6234420"," Twitter was better, of course."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6234420","6239420"," But then the discussions that took place and Reddit were amazing back in the day."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6239420","6241420"," They were fucking amazing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6242420","6244420"," Like Reddit back in the day, Reddit was fucking."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6244420","6245420"," I was a member."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6245420","6248420"," I was a member of Reddit when they were making fake posts and fake discussions."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6248420","6251420"," Uh, just to get people on it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6251420","6254420"," Uh, but do like, I'd love to see that again."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6259420","6262420"," Yeah, so many, yeah, yeah, Cesar expects just lingering."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6262420","6264420"," They try to, they, they astro turf that now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6264420","6269420"," When I was young, uh, brands would send, uh, people out."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6270420","6271420"," I'd be at raves and shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6271420","6274420"," Like brand people would be like, Hey man, can we talk to you for five minutes?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6274420","6280420"," Um, this way back in the day is like, uh, late 90s, late 90s, early 2000s."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6280420","6284420"," Now that now it's like, uh, they don't even bother anymore."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6284420","6286420"," They're, they're creating the."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6286420","6289420"," They don't have an entire underground movements."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6289420","6294420"," Like the raves they used to go to, they would be like, um, they'd be like, uh, malls that"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6294420","6297420"," were closed and you'd take over a mall."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6297420","6300420"," Like 15 year old kids like running around with mafia."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6300420","6303420"," Like they had mafia in New York and Boston, Rhode Island and shit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6303420","6305420"," Like real mafia Italian mafia."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6305420","6309420"," And they were running like gangs of kids selling drugs and stuff."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6309420","6314420"," The rave scene was like probably the last real true major underground movement around the"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6314420","6315420"," world."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6315420","6317420"," Uh, like craziness."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6317420","6319420"," Like pure craziness."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6319420","6322420"," And, uh, they, it was a silent culture too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6322420","6324420"," You didn't know about it in schools."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6324420","6326420"," Didn't know what was going on."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6326420","6332420"," You know, like 16 year old kids driving BMWs and shit coming into a parking lot in high"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6332420","6333420"," school."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6333420","6334420"," It was really bizarre."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6334420","6336420"," It was a very bizarre time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6336420","6337420"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6337420","6344420"," Uh, very, very, very, very bizarre time."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6344420","6351420"," Uh, but I mean, my point here is that you have tastemakers and, uh, tastemakers can't be"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6351420","6352420"," bought."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6352420","6353420"," They can't be bought."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6354420","6355420"," You're not going to buy them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6355420","6356420"," You're not going to create them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6356420","6357420"," You're not that they try to right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6357420","6358420"," It's a big thing to do right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6358420","6362420"," Like anoint someone as the place for all of you to migrate to."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6362420","6366420"," It's everything that a company or a corporation or an oligarch wants."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6366420","6370420"," Uh, to be that, uh, anointor of that."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6370420","6376420"," We get in the creepy crawl in the clothes or what?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6376420","6380420"," Um, so I'm fascinated by it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6380420","6384420"," I'm fascinated as culture changes over time, how that translates."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6384420","6386420"," Uh, what young people think."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6386420","6389420"," I got to ask my oldest daughter, but she's very mainstream."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6389420","6392420"," Um, she's not a counterculture person."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6392420","6399420"," You need someone that's like very counterculture that's very counterculture and very young to"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6399420","6400420"," ask."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6400420","6402420"," I would love to know what their answer is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6402420","6406420"," So if you know any kids, you're like 16 to 20 years old."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6407420","6410420"," If you have children that are extremely counterculture."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6410420","6413420"," Uh, ask them be like, Hey, what's the next?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6413420","6414420"," What's going to happen?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6414420","6419420"," Hey, kids with the skateboard over your shoulder because that they probably have the answer."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6419420","6421420"," I don't think adults have the answer."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6421420","6428420"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6428420","6433420"," Yeah, these kids are definitely not your like, if your kids are even if they're fringe,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6433420","6434420"," but still kind of normal."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6435420","6438420"," They're probably not it, but there's kids out there that know what it is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6438420","6444420"," They're probably definitively to probably like, yeah, man, it's not any of those things."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6448420","6449420"," Yeah, that's a good point too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6449420","6451420"," It's harder and harder to get counterculture."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6451420","6452420"," Yeah, it's hard."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6452420","6454420"," It's a very like these days."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6454420","6458420"," It's very much like let's create the counterculture itself to them."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6458420","6461420"," It's not as organic as it once was."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6462420","6463420"," Yeah, it's tic-tac."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6463420","6465420"," I think it might be too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6469420","6470420"," Yeah, I don't know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6470420","6473420"," You got, you got to ask a 16 year old that's like, um,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6473420","6478420"," or ask your, your, your son or daughter to find out from their friends."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6478420","6480420"," I'm going to ask my kids today."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6483420","6486420"," That's what I see is the tic-tac, man."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6487420","6491420"," Yeah, we have a very fucked up like, um,"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6491420","6493420"," they, they want to monetize us."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6493420","6495420"," They're trying to create it, trying to force it."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6495420","6497420"," That's a, that's a, that's not no bueno."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6497420","6502420"," And you got to remember that these kids are going to one day grow up and be reporters."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6502420","6505420"," Like a 16 year old that might be doing tic-tac right now."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6505420","6509420"," They're going to graduate college at 24 or 21 or 24 or some."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6509420","6511420"," You know, it, it get a masters or something."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6511420","6515420"," Start reporting for Wall Street Journal and they're going to be on tic-tac."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6515420","6518420"," I don't think that's possible, but they are."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6518420","6521420"," They're going to be on one of these sites doing their thing."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6521420","6523420"," It's going to be wild to see."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6523420","6526420"," I know you can't envision this."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6526420","6530420"," But when I was a kid, I remember that adults couldn't envision Reddit."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6530420","6533420"," They couldn't envision, uh, my space."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6533420","6539420"," They couldn't envision Facebook as being the place or even Twitter being the place."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6540420","6544420"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6544420","6545420"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6545420","6549420"," I don't know what the answer is."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6549420","6550420"," Yeah."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6550420","6552420"," What's the biggest red of cable news?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6552420","6553420"," I agree with that too."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6553420","6554420"," And the new takeover."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6554420","6558420"," It's a good question."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6558420","6562420"," President Kevin Bacon."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6562420","6566420"," Next question from the tic-tac reporter."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6567420","6568420"," You know what?"
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6568420","6571420"," I thought the rock would be, uh, I thought the rock would be the guy."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6571420","6574420"," I was like, the rock could totally be president."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6574420","6576420"," Everybody would vote."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6576420","6581420"," If he took like a very like mainstream, just like middle of the road approach, he'd be president."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6585420","6588420"," I haven't watched cable news in years."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6588420","6590420"," I don't watch it anymore."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6590420","6591420"," Don't bother."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6591420","6592420"," Don't know."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6592420","6593420"," Don't care."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6594420","6597420"," Oh, here's the squeeze, baby."
"Vg5RFJccQ-0","6597420","6598420"," For 30."
