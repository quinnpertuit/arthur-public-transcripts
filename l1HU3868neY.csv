"1060920","1070220"," realizing Profits here on the open and then buying cheaper calls and putting that Profit in your"
"1070220","1072020"," pocket does that make sense?"
"1072540","1081800"," So I I risk 67 cents or 80 cents plus another another dot led Ten cents or whatever you go"
"1081800","1086880"," back in their pocket some of that money and then you go back in and renegotiate For where we're"
"1086880","1093380"," going today whether that's up or down You don't just stay inside those calls at two at two dollars"
"1093380","1099040"," two thirty five If this thing were to ever roll over a big red bar to the depths of hell"
"1099040","1100540"," What are you out?"

"1111200","1116960"," open same thing would apply Right you took the money and ran you put some new risk on at a"
"1116960","1124520"," lower price Even if you're if you're ideas that were going up, but it reverses on you So hopefully"
"1124520","1130380"," you took the money and ran on the open this morning and then you renegotiated another move to the"
"1130380","1141200"," upside Cheaper calls and you are now realizing profit congratulations Now when"
"1141200","1145240"," I when you hedge that do you buy the same calls as puts?"
"1145700","1152020"," It depends it depends on like how cheap they are and how much you're expecting to win off when"
"1152020","1158040"," you're buying a strangle It does matter It sometimes you buy more sometimes they buy more puts or"
"1158040","1164200"," less puts depending upon the protection that I'm looking for Hey, if I'm buying a call if my thesis"
"1164200","1168300"," is these calls are going up 200 300 percent, right?"
"1168780","1172700"," That's my thesis Right there go up 200 300 percent. "
"1172960","1177960"," I have to decide well How much we're willing to burn as insurance on that as a one-to-one"
"1177960","1183660"," is a two-to-one three-to-one Right, so you could have bought three puts to one call and"
"1183660","1188600"," still made great money on that trade Into today, but you have to think about your thesis."
"1189060","1195560"," Where are we going if we get a good CPI reading We know four forty six is definitely on the"
"1195560","1197720"," board without a doubt, right?"
"1198500","1207080"," Hands down that's your weekly expected upside moving it moving target Your two Sigma move is up"
"1207080","1212500"," here at four forty eight and four fifty oh four It's actually slightly higher."
"1212640","1220220"," I think too, but it's somewhere it's somewhere up in here But you get my point right you're you"
"1220220","1228660"," have to think about What like you're you're planning your trade you're saying I think we're going"
"1228660","1230280"," here not well I don't know. "
"1230360","1234440"," I'm just gonna buy some fucking calls and I don't know if they're gonna make 100% 50% 10 "
"1234440","1238900","% 30% 300% you have to think about What what is my thesis?"
"1239320","1243680"," What do I think's going to happen if it goes wrong if we have a hot reading?"
"1244380","1245280"," What is four thirty four?"
"1245360","1250960"," Do you know four thirty five is the expected weekly low four thirty five?"
"1251120","1255580"," That's the expected weekly low, so you're already thinking about well if I buy insurance What"
"1255580","1259000"," should it be should it be something that's in the money outside the money?"
"1259160","1262860"," Should it be the weekly low if we get a hot report and it goes the wrong way."
"1263080","1264940"," What is that going to print for me?"
"1269950","1270510"," Good morning."

"5763530","5773130"," Those aren't so bad I like put spreads on spy But if you're a seller They're way"
"5773130","5783820"," better ways to sell Yes, at least if you're directionally right sometimes we'll be trading puts And"
"5783820","5787620"," we'll get to You guys watch us do it, right?"
"5787800","5793320"," Well, we'll be directionally right we'll get there and The price still hasn't gone up like"
"5793320","5799760"," literally just Start a 10 cents and a 10 cents directionally got there if you're trading futures"
"5799760","5800920"," you'd be making money, right?"
"5801120","5806600"," So you're directionally right you're making money Puts are a challenge man. "
"5806820","5812080"," They're one of the worst like spy puts one of the worst products to trade I think they're garbage,"
"5812080","5819880"," but they're not the worst you you X Y are Like there's some other worst ones, but it's one of"
"5819880","5824940"," the worst products I've ever traded I Try not to trade them sometimes that will if we're gonna get"
"5824940","5830640"," a big reversal or something to the downside, but I 10 I tend to lose a lot of money trading"
"5830640","5840420"," puts even if I'm directionally right Yeah, you have to like you have to like so."
"5840520","5844580"," I just took profit on this bar right here Like almost right here."

"5846220","5854160"," Literally took profit right there like you like in out See I'm out of here I Don't give a fuck"
"5854160","5860680"," either if we had like bled down here I wouldn't have cared if we went straight down right here I"
"5860680","5866660"," still want to close right there cuz like nine out of ten times you're not getting that red bar,"
"5866900","5867060"," right?"
"5867340","5874710"," So you're gonna get fucked up if you think You're gonna get fucked up you like you start counting"
"5874710","5878450"," your when you when I go back and look at my trade log I'm like where did I fuck up"
"5878450","5878710"," or?"
"5879590","5889310"," Usually when I fuck up it's Tired hungover Not paying attention Greed"
"5889310","5895430"," Not renegotiating all those things we talk about here."
"5896430","5898250"," Those are the ones that are bad, right?"
"5908590","5910390"," I'm trying to drop it and get it down here."
"5912980","5920020"," Let's see if we can look at it in a five-minute I want you to know that normally if"
"5920020","5926440"," we come down here and tag this You're gonna see if we tag this this PT two right here. "
"5926880","5935640"," So what you'll see is a red bar come down You're gonna see an immediate squeeze to the upside here"
"5935640","5945630"," and This this white line here will come down And if we're"
"5945630","5958160"," gonna get a bigger reversal you'll see This kind of nonsense right here This"
"5958160","5960300"," would be green and then you have a bigger move down."
"5960420","5962180"," That's a pretty big fucking move though, right?"
"5962380","5973220"," Look at that shit This is the larger move down It's a pretty giant move I Don't"
"5973220","5973860"," think you get it."
"5973900","5975240"," This is flattening out right now. "
"5975260","5976220"," See that flattening out."
"5976420","5984780"," You don't want to see this You want to see this like begin to roll We might be bottoming we're"
"5984780","5992660"," getting close to bottoming I think And that's what a bear wants to see right Bam bam bam bam push"
"5992660","5999840"," up Rejection and then bam and a breakthrough right there We're starting to flatten though."
"5999860","6001000"," See this red line right here. "
"6001600","6003580"," I don't like seeing this flat right here."
"6003600","6006940"," It's this flat move So I want you to pay attention to this stuff."
"6007060","6009740"," So Notice there's a five minute chart, right?"
"6010280","6015840"," Notice how we got the first low right there We had a failure to get a low right there. "
"6015840","6024460"," Well, that's a low, but it's with no conviction This this red candle should have been It's red"
"6024460","6032680"," candle should have been way down here So it's showing no conviction from sellers Showing weak"
"6032680","6034560"," sellers is what it's showing."
"6034880","6039800"," So and now you're now because you didn't get that big red bar here You didn't get a big red"
"6039800","6045500"," candle right here Now that you don't have those big red candles, you're watching this one 29 and"
"6045500","6048420"," start to flatten See how it's beginning to flatten."
"6048440","6055860"," This is showing you before it happens That sellers are losing momentum to the downside, okay?"
"6056940","6059380"," So you're seeing a squeeze right now at the screen bar. "
"6059600","6068020"," We're gonna recheck this white bar earlier than expected and See if sellers are actually stronger"
"6068020","6075660"," than buyers these candles are telling you the story right here at this one and That one right there"
"6075660","6078200"," that that end of sight indecision candle."
"6078760","6079680"," That's right here."
"6079680","6086100"," Let me see they can Anyways, so this candle my cursor is on in this candle right here Showing you"
"6086100","6090940"," that sellers are losing momentum to the downside So I'm gonna come up here and just check and make"
"6090940","6098860"," sure that there are actually sellers here This line here flattening is telling that same story So"
"6098860","6104360"," we'll find out right here if sellers are strongly will stand they will step in right here to sell"
"6104360","6113020"," it back down to reverse this the downside And you'll get your PT two right here Not good look"
"6113020","6117880"," though for sell side right now none of this is good for sell side It's a nice throw over right"
"6117880","6125060"," here, but you wanted continuation Not getting that continuation is not a good sign for for sellers"
"6127840","6135960"," You see that candle right there that one right there This was demand This indecision candle right"
"6135960","6140680"," here was not good for the sell side So come over here and just check make sure that the sellers"
"6140680","6146620"," are who they say they are They're strong as they say they are This candle will go straight up and"
"6146620","6150280"," tag it should Go straight up and tag the five minute. "
"6150400","6157660"," We'll see if the sellers are still in still in charge here Not a good look sellers not a good"
"6157660","6167600"," fucking look here Always like to see that follow through"
"6168180","6174180"," new low new low And you don't ever want to see these green candles like see that's a good that's"
"6174180","6186520"," good for sellers But this one right here is garbage so They're gonna try to get up here You want"
"6186520","6193100"," to see like this green candle be like boom None of that bullshit You want to see all you want"
"6193100","6198760"," to see just a green failure here and then bam to the downside So everything is saying to you that"
"6198760","6207920"," there's a little bit of a momentum Being lost by sellers right now a little bit of a momentum here"
"6207920","6224420"," a bit of a momentum loss I'm so glad I'm fucking flat right now get smoked in this trade Oh"
"6239270","6241350"," Pissed off sellers right here anger."
"6253350","6259530"," No, I'm flat right now When I started seeing this stuff down here all this bullshit down here."
"6259750","6268650"," I took my I took four cents I think three cents four cents And I want nothing to do with"
"6268650","6268750"," this. "
"6268870","6275090"," I want to see strength see this See this right here this red this red Like I want to see"
"6275090","6276330"," this thing rolling over."
"6276610","6280370"," I don't want to see the red flattening None of that stuff."
"6280570","6282030"," I don't like seeing the red come up. "
"6282170","6287950"," I want to see it flatten out and begin to roll So in my mind what I'm looking for before"
"6287950","6289170"," you even we're even there right?"
"6289330","6296270"," I'm looking for this to flatten and start to turn I'm looking for this white line right here not to"
"6296270","6300270"," turn up see this white line turning up This is white line going like this."
"6300550","6307210"," I don't like seeing that I Want to see this white line come down vertical and You know, I'd be"
"6307210","6307610"," vicious."
"6307910","6309050"," I shouldn't be doing like that. "
"6309190","6316650"," It's just straight down See so this see that kink right here It's not that we can't keep going"
"6316650","6316910"," down."
"6316910","6322510"," It's that it's a little bit of an it's not like it's not Sellers aren't strong here."
"6322630","6323910"," It's what's saying to you before it even happens. "
"6324410","6329630"," So we're a little bit We're a little bit weak here in the sell side So we're likely gonna squeeze"
"6329630","6335150"," up here make sure that the strong sellers are actually still here and see the squeeze happening"
"6335150","6342740"," right now You shouldn't we shouldn't close red in the day."
"6342740","6352480"," There's so a couple things here You have dealers that are not going to want to print Both sides"
"6352480","6354760"," sometimes they will but it's rare."
"6355040","6362820"," It's like a one-on-a-ten chance Sometimes if we hit STX cell, yes, we can close red Which"
"6362820","6369720"," we got close to STX cell, so I guess you have an argument there It's very rare normally a dealer"
"6369720","6374600"," is what they'll do is they'll anything that you so think about it like this Think about it when"
"6374600","6379900"," you're in a losing trade Let's say you bought puts yesterday, right?"
"6381100","6382620"," And so you come in it today. "
"6382820","6390540"," Let's see bottom for 50 cents so You get you bottom 50 cents, right?"
"6390840","6391620"," Let's see about yesterday."
"6392200","6400450"," Let's say you bought a 440 P's And there are 50 cents They're gonna bleed those out."
"6400610","6405550"," They might hit that 440 P before the end of the week But they're gonna they're gonna send them the"
"6405550","6409370"," fucking zero two cents ten cents Seven cents. "
"6409610","6410050"," They don't care."
"6410230","6417670"," They're taking your money They'll even let them expire then afterwards go hit that 440 P But like"
"6417670","6425250"," your trade from yesterday's my point here is your trade from yesterday is dead It's gone."
"6425450","6428150"," It's dead some like maybe one out of ten trades. "
"6428550","6429470"," It's not dead."
"6429490","6430070"," It comes back."
"6430390","6435110"," Whoa, you should stay in the trade But if you if you add those up like ten of those another"
"6435110","6440210"," ten of those another ten of those Here's it like the key point here is if you do ten of"
"6440210","6446890"," those a hundred times Of a hundred of your losing trades if you were to have stayed in them you"
"6446890","6450990"," likely At the end result would be you're a losing trader. "
"6451310","6459550"," So You have to like be directionally right If you're directionally wrong, do you pull the plug if"
"6459550","6464470"," your thesis is right and it just isn't going your way Do you just add to your position?"
"6465250","6469930"," But oftentimes if you look if I look at my bad trades the ones where I'm losing a lot of"
"6469930","6476050"," money typically Not just because of what I'm doing or I'm hung over or something But those trades"
"6476970","6485430"," Where I lose the most money Are the ones where like it would be like today like I'm bearish on"
"6485430","6485910"," CPI."
"6486510","6495330"," I'm fucking just on puts and I'm thinking they're gonna at least print And a day today tomorrow and"
"6495330","6501590"," eight out of nine time or nine out of ten times They're not they might but it's rare now if"
"6501590","6502810"," they're expiring today, right?"
"6503310","6509410"," So Or if they did hit they're gonna be worth less right worthless at that point."
"6509590","6517550"," So oftentimes if you get the trade wrong so let's say if you were a If you got the trade"
"6517550","6521730"," wrong on the cloak on the open today or you open up this morning like shit I was all I"
"6521730","6527390"," was on zero day puts close those fucking things right on the bell and you reposition yourself And"
"6527390","6536410"," take the Ellen move on Would be the point It's re and reposition yourself for your thesis and in my"
"6536410","6543550"," view that's been my experience calls puts doesn't matter But you can be thesis what wise correct"
"6543550","6550730"," and have to adjust their DCA to get to where you're going Now to make your money that all works"
"6552350","6558530"," But usually if you pick a direction if I'm like hey, we're going up We're gonna we're gonna squeeze"
"6558530","6563170"," up into this clothes right here and we just start fucking selling off down here the moment that"
"6563170","6570430"," thesis breaks Take like I'm gonna pull up or not pull up on a rejection up here candle You cut"
"6570430","6576310"," your losses and let it sell down if we're in calls, I guess Matter of fact I had that happen"
"6576310","6582750"," right in here I bought some calls up in here and The moment we went started rolling over my thesis"
"6582750","6583370"," was broken. "
"6583470","6589930"," I fucking cut myself out of that trade Right my thesis is my and my thesis up there is we're"
"6589930","6597050"," gonna go back and test The five minute 30 EMA right we're gonna go back down here and test it"
"6598050","6603230"," Right and then I set it right in stream I'm like we have to get a new high within the"
"6603230","6604230"," 15 minutes, right?"
"6605170","6614470"," any failure of Getting that new high in the next 15 minutes leads to a much larger down move Which"
"6614470","6622770"," we're getting right and we should test this PT to at some point we should Because we failed this we"
"6622770","6626350"," are here because of the failure here does it make sense?"
"6627290","6635070"," The failure to get a new high shows that there's no Will or demand to go higher by buyers."
"6635630","6641070"," So you go down and you check The moment that happens you go down and check not the white line"
"6641070","6646030"," We already checked that right now We're gonna get out here and check the red line and see if there"
"6646030","6651690"," is demand from buyers here If those buyers aren't here guess where we go next we go down and we"
"6651690","6653090"," check the hourly trigger, right?"
"6653090","6661170"," So tactful right one two three trades now in this process of all this You're looking for that"
"6661170","6664790"," conviction and how much time have we spent here right now, right?"
"6664990","6666870"," Like this was a good conviction trade to the downside."
"6667310","6668930"," It was really fast, right?"
"6669390","6674970"," So right now we're spending a lot of time here You haven't tested PT to yet, right?"
"6675490","6682570"," So it's concerning like you're a sell side you want to see Just like decision like bam bam bam bam"
"6682570","6684050"," boom to the downside, right?"
"6684890","6692110"," Right now we know there's buyers hiding down here trying to buy this so the longer we spend trading"
"6692110","6698990"," sideways here The more likelihood that we're gonna reverse to the upside Well, you'll end up seeing"
"6698990","6708790"," is this will turn This will come up we will trade up Some kind of a garbage"
"6708790","6718740"," trade like this and maybe even higher into this clothes over here Anyways, doesn't mean it's gonna"
"6718740","6719100"," happen. "
"6719120","6730670"," It's just it looks like garbage Looks like garbage Now"
"6730670","6731610"," can we close red?"
"6732010","6736430"," Yeah, we can close red But even if we I don't think that we do I think that we we"
"6736430","6740010"," hit this hourly trigger and keep on going I hope I hope that we get down there."
"6740090","6745370"," I'd like to see us like get down here and Then start the next leg right there I guess that's"
"6745370","6749390"," farther in time But even so saying all that do you see where we are?"
"6749570","6759140"," I mean like look at that like green here Even if you could close the gap down here Even if"
"6759140","6765240"," you were like as bearish as possible in bloodbath this you'd likely still get the clothes to the"
"6765240","6772120"," upside and maintain that That whole upward movement like this is bullish not bearish, right?"
"6774200","6775820"," I'm still bullish right here overall."
"6775820","6784940"," So These fucking buyers man, they're relentless Refucking lentilist dude these buyers don't fucking"

"10138400","10145400"," another way to look and see how risk off the market is So The idea being is this like it's"

"12287640","12295140"," move into the 20th 21st And then bam we start another run higher there again to the upside makes"
"12295140","12304090"," sense So right now bulls And the funniest part is right this probably news saying we're going to"

"12309730","12315090"," they're going to drop it on your ass next week And then that'll be the actual move up to target"
"12315090","12324630"," 460 465 Uh, there is one more note to be said here"
"12325870","12329550"," There's one more note to be made here that I want to be clear with you especially if you're new"
"12329550","12339050"," to this channel The longer we run hot like this the more There is a chance of a"
"12339050","12344670"," correction Uh A major not a major correction, but a big correction. "
"12345310","12346390"," So the longer we do this."
"12346390","12349390"," Let's say we go through july We crank up through july."
"12349530","12359790"," We crank up through half of august Uh that that correction gets um More likely as time passes As"
"12359790","12368870"," we're training this here If at any point there's some unknown news that hits the market Uh, I"
"12368870","12370730"," wouldn't it wouldn't be shocked with a correction. "
"12371370","12379630"," So as we trade up here like right we are right now Whether we fail this Uh retest up here"
"12379630","12380950"," or we fail this right here."
"12380990","12388830"," It's not a bad idea to put some protection on Uh some cheap protection if you don't know what cheap"
"12388830","12396570"," protection is if you're one along this market Uh ratio spreads are great You can put some time on"
"12396570","12396830"," them."
"12397250","12403530"," Uh, you can do it to a bearish Ratio spread just google search it go on to youtube Uh look"
"12403530","12411150"," up a bear ratio spread and you can put on put one on And if we go up you'll either"
"12411150","12418190"," break even or make about five to ten percent So you can actually make money if you're wrong If we"
"12418190","12425210"," go down you'll get paid Uh, so there is risk as time passes to that correction happening. "
"12425370","12431850"," It happens in every bull run Uh to three times a year at minimum We're kind of do for one"
"12431850","12432490"," right now."
"12432670","12439590"," Last time we had one was in uh, uh, uh, April 28th Uh, maybe it may it may fourth was"
"12439590","12440930"," last time I got close to one."
"12441190","12444970"," So we're now in july Uh, it's time passes. "
"12445530","12452710"," We're due for one Right now that target down below for that correction is 420 4200 so if you're"

"19118710","19129550"," below 333 It's bearish How"
"19129550","19130290"," does good question?"
"19130450","19132830"," How does ppi generally affect the market?"
"19133310","19140310"," So ppi right Uh is producer price index and then you have cpi that's consumer price or I think it's"
"19140310","19147490"," consumer price index But basically if I if I own um cap and jim james Grocery store, right?"
"19148250","19155870"," You have the cost that i'm charging you so I charge you ten dollars For a gallon of milk Right"
"19155870","19164250"," and the milk let's say the milk is costing me a dollar Right, uh, it cost me a dollar I'm"
"19164250","19169270"," charging you ten someone has a sale and they go down to eight dollars So then so then my price"
"19169270","19172670"," that I'm selling I have to go I have to compete with that guy So I dropped my price of"
"19172670","19173850"," milk down to eight dollars."
"19174010","19179610"," That makes sense So there's competition in the marketplace To like inflation is the way it's not"
"19179610","19188210"," weird but inflation is the way it thing where um If the producers Are charging me eight dollars And"
"19188210","19195830"," i'm charging you ten Right the ppi if that's bad like really high and i'm just taking a loss as"
"19195830","19205730"," a as a retailer Um, that's bad right you want to see ppi coming down um Because what so let's"
"19205730","19210290"," say let's say instead of charging me eight dollars for ten dollar gallon milk charging me two And"
"19210290","19216930"," i'm still charging ten There's another guy out there that's going to charge less for that milk and"
"19216930","19224290"," that is what brings inflation down Bottom line for you and I as a pleb Right now ppi is high"
"19224970","19229930"," um That's bad for you and I as a pleb because at minimum you have to even have taken a"
"19229930","19234210"," even if they're taking a shellacad on it Uh, it's going to be bad for you as the as the"
"19234210","19240430"," end consumer now a note on this I said that I went shopping I made a key point earlier in"
"19240430","19246390"," the week to you guys I said to you I went food shopping and I found eggs for a dollar"
"19246390","19256210"," a dozen When you see eggs for a dollar a dozen it puts Competition into the"
"19256210","19262010"," marketplace to drop pricing So if I saw I did see eggs for a dollar a dozen so if I"
"19262010","19268530"," see eggs for a dollar a dozen That's telling me that ppi is likely much lower And if you find"
"19268530","19276750"," lower ppi Right if we get lower ppi tomorrow What that's going to mean is The market will trigger"
"19277670","19283470"," Inflation to continue to drop Now there might be two other guys selling eggs right now for five or"
"19283470","19288390"," six bucks or eight bucks or whatever But they're get their sales numbers are going to take a hit"
"19288950","19292110"," And once they take a hit they're gonna be like hey Why don't we stop selling that?"
"19292230","19294190"," Why aren't we selling the eggs for seven dollars anymore?"
"19294790","19298410"," And they're like oh because um, oh wait, why are our numbers dropping on selling eggs at eight"
"19298410","19298650"," bucks?"
"19298870","19302870"," We love We love Taking these people for a ride, right?"
"19303010","19307710"," The eggs still cost us 50 cents, but we're making a killing Well, this other grocery store over"
"19307710","19311350"," here decided to undercut you so they could steal all your business, right?"
"19312830","19319030"," So ppi I think is coming down My best bet right now is that ppi is coming down. "
"19319150","19326930"," That's a big factor for Inflation So my my guess here is that we're gonna get some great ppi ppi"
"19326930","19333730"," numbers tomorrow Now we did earlier in the week talk about some other aspects of cpi we said yeah"
"19333730","19339410"," We know two places where it isn't coming down right cars in housing and that's the same thing the"
"19339410","19345350"," gs I think said and jpm like we know what's costing us more than it should we know people that"
"19345350","19353870"," are gouging and price gouging but one of the one of the ways to undercut price gouging Is when your"
"19353870","19361490"," producers are charging less For what you're consuming because then you'll get price wars between"
"19361490","19367450"," the retailers We're not seeing that quite right now right now in housing right or in vehicles."
"19367450","19374250"," We're not seeing that matter of fact You have active automakers saying we're not going to sell"
"19374250","19380010"," these cars for anything less And this then full full price right which we need to get automakers to"
"19380010","19384570"," compete with each other So that they're selling a more reasonably priced car if that drops the use"
"19384570","19391990"," car market uh And until we see that we have artificially inflated Yeah, you see those fucking"
"19391990","19396970"," sellers going in you see that fuck those dirty fucking trappers See these trappers up in here"
"19396970","19398310"," trying to trap you in down here."
"19398310","19408110"," You see that That's sneaky dirty dirty trap right there my take here is Ppi will be good"
"19408110","19414650"," for most goods and services It's going to be fucking terrible for cars Uh, it's going to be"
"19414650","19422870"," terrible for stuff like that um cars housing Any of that kind of stuff but like raw goods Uh basic"
"19422870","19424490"," necessities all that kind of stuff. "
"19424550","19438870"," It should come down significantly Now"
"19438870","19441030"," you see that right there you guys watching this clothes right here."
"19441110","19446450"," There's a trap in here See that trap in there like they're not going to give you the full down"
