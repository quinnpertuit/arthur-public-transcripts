"271460","278760"," and finish so it doesn't mean we don't finish today because we've got some giant range expansion"
"278760","288320"," today but normally anyone those trapped up here right normally would not expect to revisit this"
"288320","294780"," high I want you to know that now it's a weird day right we could have something something could be"
"294780","301460"," different today but I want you to realize that somewhere up in here this is where that this is"
"301460","308900"," where I had that stopped on yesterday right there's a chance we can get up here to our one and"
"308900","318620"," sell off it's hard on days like today because normally if we hadn't sold off yesterday I'd be like"
"318620","323500"," yeah we can get up here no problem but in the same week you can see it the entire week"
"323500","332860"," we can see it here right we had this major sell-off day even when we blasted off in these"
"332860","338200"," calls these calls printed like 5,000 percent they're gonna make this quick for the open because I'm"
"338200","343280"," probably gonna sell right on the bell but they still didn't come back up here revisit the top and"
"343280","348660"," you notice that right sell-off here right nice nice rip up higher but again you don't sell you"
"348660","353560"," don't you don't come back here right just the point that I'm trying to make it doesn't mean that"
"353560","360380"," you can't come back there it just means it's unusual right so like that nine out of ten times even"
"360380","366920"," if you have that face ripper you don't typically especially in the same week they'll come back here"
"366920","371920"," they just won't come back here in the same week you know they'll make sure they burn everyone"
"371920","379240"," that's up here everyone's trapped here and so I'm just thinking about this up here and I don't know"
"379240","386380"," if we're gonna revisit up there today we could but it's not the norm is my point so and we've"
"386380","392700"," got a huge range expansion day this is this is huge talking about 3 to 8 17 all the way"

"867660","873980"," they started yesterday this is where the one hour was yesterday so this could be I'll check to see"
"873980","879920"," if this is the trigger to move up today but this was a key level up here this is where"
"879920","885940"," I had the red bar yesterday uh it's two two spots to be thinking about the first one is this"
"885940","890660"," is where the the stops were triggered yesterday remember we had that yellow we had that yellow line"
"890660","896380"," right here and I was like we break this yellow line I was like it's on right this is the"
"896380","901560"," in the one hour we knew the big blue line was right in here if we broke through this you"
"901560","908160"," guys remember that big red bar came down that was it it was on right we don't usually revisit the"
"908160","918260"," full we can but we just tech we just usually don't revisit the actual the actual top here you"
"918260","924200"," can actually see it the past week now that we haven't they will eventually a week or two later"
"924200","929620"," sometimes they'll come back and revisit it and close that gap but not always not always so it'll be"
"929620","938920"," interesting to see if we can actually get straight up here if we fail right here possibly if it"
"938920","944840"," goes that high it can happen it just that it's just not the norm it's very unusual to see it"
"944840","955800"," happen the week week"
"955800","963220"," you can see if you're just joining us I'll show you examples of where we haven't revisited so you"

"972020","978260"," bottom we bought I think the first round of calls I bought ended up printing like 5000 percent into"
"978260","985160"," that bell but it still didn't come up here right it's still left behind it's still never it's still"
"985160","991080"," trapped any of the buyers that were up there and you can see the same thing you can see see"
"991080","997480"," the same thing here right right you buy this bottom it comes up it sells down and it doesn't ever"

"1005260","1012700"," it's rare right it's not the it's not the norm and so that's my only concern with this morning is"
"1012700","1022620"," do we actually get up there and close the entire the entire the entire move which is right up"
"1022620","1029180"," here our one is three eighty one twenty one I'd probably be considering taking some profit up here"

"7115260","7116660"," squeeze above this r2."
"7116840","7126920"," So there's some big resistance here But the momentum could make it really squeezy in here So"

"10280790","10281230"," now, right?"
"10281230","10285290"," So you're gonna see this blue line come up and up and up and up So on the one minute"
"10285290","10292430"," of the five-minute time frame super bullish right now There is some some velocity is Just the it's"
"10292430","10296490"," like the point that uh, James is making was even though we're going up and up right now the"
"10296490","10306240"," velocity is low So, uh, if you're a bear Uh, even though it's"
"10306240","10312280"," bullish right here If you're a bear there's there's not a lot of velocity right now in this move So"
"10312800","10319880"," If the velocity continues to slow Uh, you'll see a retracement blower here, but it was weird"
"10319880","10325080"," because this keeps moving up though This was down here just a few minutes ago Somewhere down in"
"10325080","10331600"," here and now it's just moving higher and higher So long as we stay around this area here Uh,"
"10332820","10338320"," eventually that blue line's gonna come up here and it could it could provide a kick higher, right?"
"10339160","10349340"," This huge move higher Let"
"10349340","10386740"," me check the box again somewhere down here currently right there You're"
"10386740","10391060"," a bear and you're caught short right now You're praying and hoping that we break this this blue"
"10391060","10414210"," line in the one minute Praying and hoping that you break this right now You"
"10414210","10422370"," know, you're the best person to ask About today is volatility was I shit you not Uh, there's been a"
"10422370","10427890"," couple dates in the past It doesn't always happen, but uh, you remember at volatility was he was on"
"10427890","10434990"," the show Back in the day He would come out on days like today like the day before like a"
"10434990","10440670"," heat come out like a week before and be like If we burn down into this Thursday, um, opac snow"
"10440670","10449830"," picks but the end of month We're gonna go fucking starboard like 3% move in a day 2%"
"10449830","10450010"," move. "
"10450170","10451970"," We're yeah, almost that 2% today, right?"
"10452230","10460450"," So I'm serious like that doesn't always happen, but Uh, he talks about Uh, how we come into these"
"10460450","10468190"," days Uh, the thursday before and opac so the thursday before and end of the month For an end of"
"10468190","10481790"," the quarter and and how you can have these crazy moves So"
"10481790","10488410"," Saying that uh, the higher the early velocity the better they provide support Uh, so 15 minutes"
"10488410","10495170"," left if price closes above 3d4 spy will have a powerful hourly velocity So in the next 15 minutes"
"10495170","10501860"," spy has to close above 3d4 Which is uh, right over here."
"10501860","10520960"," So we'll we'll we'll write this right here must close And"
"10522660","10531140"," we have to close above 3d4 To get a velocity trigger to move higher and later in the day So"
"10531140","10539460"," at 1230, okay, we have to close at four at 3d4 And that's basically saying on the five-minute"
"10539460","10539700"," chart."
"10540000","10549800"," You'll see On the 21 EMA it's going it's going to technically provide the support"
"10549800","10569820"," needed Uh for this for this leg higher here you see that right there So"
"10569820","10577380"," keep it in the five-minute and uh, I'll just leave it with this with this five-minute here But"
"10577380","10595320"," you guys you should ask uh volatility was because he's got this information Shorts"
"10595320","10599660"," just being left behind currently they had a chance right here to get back. "
"10599780","10605120"," They're being left behind here This will lead to short squeezes, right?"
"10605420","10611860"," That's the point right if you close above here And the bear knows that We're not coming back here."
"10611880","10619200"," Does that make sense so that the chance of coming back to close A short here diminishes And so we"
"10619200","10621920"," end up having is uh, the squeeze happens, right?"
"10622040","10632690"," You end up getting that squeeze All"

"11187480","11195180"," engineers They're in my family and uh some friendly acquaintances in that group that i've known"
"11195180","11202860"," over the years and uh They worked for elon for a long time and left for startup auto companies Some"
"11202860","11207520"," of them are still a few of them are still working for some of the startup auto ed companies But"
"11207520","11216960"," a lot of gone back to work for musk with actually large large salaries and large um stock options"
"11218060","11229070"," So you're I think you're what you're saying is correct But"
"11229070","11236330"," there's a lot of rehires in tesla right now Uh that i've been lured back with not only uh, or"
"11236330","11246190"," not only options but for not options, but uh stock But stock but uh high much higher"
"11246190","11252450"," pay Whatever brain drain tesla had he went back out and sought those people back out to bring him"
"11252450","11259390"," back on board And uh, it was about two or three years ago And all these people still work for"
"11259390","11259530"," him."
"11259670","11266970"," He's lured a lot of people back to from some of those startups I don't want to say too much"
"11266970","11276850"," because it's um It's probably not legal to say too much So Some of what you're saying is right"
"11276850","11292280"," some of it is Not exactly my experience at least with people that I know that work at tesla Yeah,"
"11292440","11301280"," I I have family family and friends that work for him in some pretty high positions and They lost a"
"11301280","11307460"," lot of those so they so I know for sure that tesla lost a lot of those people uh, the"
"11307460","11316280"," original Brains behind tesla And then those people came back within two years ago, I think two or"
"11316280","11325950"," three years ago and they're still there Maybe the point I guess maybe the point I guess maybe the"
"11325950","11330750"," point would be If they'd had stock options two three years ago, they're probably within some"
"11330750","11338750"," serious pain right now But probably part of that group that's like averaged in it $200 a share So"
"11338750","11339850"," maybe that's why they're pissed off."
"11340350","11345670"," I can see that I haven't talked to Uh, I haven't talked about tesla with any family members"
"11345670","11355070"," recently so I've tried not to I've been trying to they know that it they know that I trade tesla. "
"11355170","11368960"," So, um We keep the conversations quite light Yeah,"
"11369040","11370060"," so rumors equal bullshit."
"11370120","11382580"," Yeah, I agree with that Yeah, I agree with that john Yeah, so"
"11382580","11387320"," that's how maybe i'm suspicious maybe i'm thinking of that would be They lured a bunch of people"
"11387320","11388600"," back about two or three years ago."
"11388600","11394460"," So If they were cranking maybe this past summer they're all their stock options look great. "
"11394720","11404410"," Maybe right now they're like what the hell All right, so it's"
"11404410","11412450"," 1230 it's 1230 right now where we closed below 384 right, you know what that means We're going to"
"11412450","11417190"," put a target down below again Didn't have strength here."
"11417190","11434730"," So we're going to have a target down below Thanks"

"11463440","11474700"," So, 382 75 We'll"
"11474700","11484650"," see if this works This is the anemoy indicator And it's saying that we're losing"
"11484650","11491850"," velocity on the hourly here So we need to come back down to find better velocity better support"
"11492630","11493830"," More supportive environment."
"11494050","11507540"," So we're going to look to see if we can get down here Yeah,"

"11774650","11795360"," So short to like please lord, please baby jesus come on down Says"
"11795360","11804150"," we'll definitely catch support at the five-minute trigger Says uh saying this is important."
"11804450","11807790"," It doesn't matter if the price moves below the woman at trigger for just a minute or two But once"
"11807790","11816330"," the trajectory of the trigger starts to turn down That's when most of the Hold on here See what"
"11816330","11822790"," he's saying here This is important."
"11822950","11826430"," It doesn't matter if price moves below the woman at trigger for just a minute or two But once the"
"11826430","11830910"," trajectory of the trigger starts to turn That's when most likely will come down to the retest of"

"11836390","11844710"," So he's saying that right up here That you're gonna see You You're gonna see the the red bar"
"11844710","11849930"," straight down to this red or this red bar down Uh, we'll catch support here."

"11911950","11923260"," i'm on the woman at chart james is watching in the background right now he's watching at uh So"
"11923260","11928440"," he's saying that uh, you can buy calls at the five-minute trigger with a stop-loss 10 cents below"
"11928440","11938310"," for an excellent risk reward Yeah, i've got some setup i got a Some setup on 384 c's right"
"11938310","11950600"," now So i'm just waiting to see if it comes down here and touches We're"

"11985460","11995930"," chart Yeah, we were watching this uh, we had this here that must close above At"
"11995930","12002980"," 1230 and it didn't so he rolled I wonder if I should have jumped in right here."
"12003880","12016470"," I didn't buy any calls here by the way Should"
"12016470","12025040"," I probably should have bought this right here and it didn't Getting left behind all these bears"
"12025040","12025580"," down here. "
"12025720","12032580"," They're all like those bears over here like Don't don't don't do not turn around Like don't turn"

"12043980","12054860"," turn around turn around turn around It"
"12056690","12059090"," didn't even get to the james if you're listening right now."
"12059110","12065030"," It didn't even get down on the uh In the big blue line I guess I should make this blue"
"12065030","12074020"," not red I'm still waiting bro"
"12082360","12112340"," I'm"
"12117460","12123380"," still waiting bro Say if you're listening james, I'm not trying to say that uh That it needs to be"
"12123380","12123920"," a pin strike."
"12123920","12125120"," You called it right here brother. "
"12125280","12128640"," It rolled I'm I missed the I just missed the trade here."
"12128760","12137700"," So Hopefully it comes back down here and touches my my block my blue line right here So I'm still"
"12137700","12158300"," down here waiting I"
"12158300","12167780"," probably will get I probably will get this trade I'll probably left behind bro I'm getting left"
"12167780","12182680"," behind here I'm getting left behind Okay, so that trades over there So"
"12182680","12192430"," this is the bear trap He's saying that uh bears"
"12192430","12199590"," just took control so he's saying that um You know how we talk about Bears just took control of the"
"12199590","12200610"," one-minute chart here, right?"
"12200750","12204290"," We broke below it Came up rejected came up."
"12204410","12205370"," We should see a second rejection. "
"12205690","12217220"," Hopefully we can get down here So the bears are in control of the one minute right now I'm"
"12217220","12227220"," gonna put I'm gonna call james right now From on from on the live stream here Oh It looks"
"12227220","12239740"," like he's on a uh, he's on a call I'll"
"12239740","12249530"," see if we can get him on Okay, so I got you on the live stream right"
"12249530","12256790"," now Okay, so first of all so notice how what I say before it's not about price breaking below the"
"12256790","12261690"," one minute The one minute ema that you have up on the chart price can break above for momentarily"
"12261690","12267610"," and pop right back up It's not the trajectory of the ema So look at the bearing in it the"
"12267610","12271150"," trajectory of the ema the blue line start to turn down."
"12271250","12277430"," Yeah The minute that happened you had to sell it right after so when i'm in calls on these kind"
"12277430","12286390"," of groups I'm not worried about place But worries me it is the second the trajectory of it starts"
"12286390","12291210"," to turn down That tells me that bears have not taken control of that ema I got sure and that's"
"12291210","12295390"," what i'm out of my calls So you're saying so you're saying here if this if this blue line starts"
"12295390","12302770"," to roll like this I'm putting it on right now Which it hasn't done What do you mean if it"
"12302770","12307970"," starts to roll you're saying if the trajectory of the of the ema on the one minute starts to roll"
"12307970","12314470"," over Yeah, so the trajectory of the ema started to turn down Um, what minute was it?"
"12314710","12324550"," Let me see it was uh right here 12 24 yeah, it was on um Yeah, right"
"12324550","12331310"," around 12 24 12 25 start to roll right here Okay, so so that so that's why i'm that's an"
"12331310","12335950"," off the atom out of my calls So now the next step now that bears have control of the one"
"12335950","12341190"," minute trigger you want to wait Occasionally even if price breaks above the woman trigger again I"
"12341190","12345590"," don't think there's another move higher price needs to retest the five in the trigger before"
"12345590","12350610"," another new fire That's what it looks like to me So the way I set this up is that I"
"12350610","12356210"," buy at the five in the trigger stop loss 10 cents below So i'll even buy at the money because"
"12356210","12362690"," I just immediately set my stop loss 10 cents below each contract that I bought And then once price"
"12362690","12368950"," bounces off the five in the trigger and moves back above the woman trigger Beers that took control"
"12368950","12374810"," of the woman trigger But you wait again bringing price to a new high That's when you'll make the"
"12374810","12379730"," new high in the day So you want to retest back to the five minute trigger And then you want"
"12379730","12385090"," price to break above the woman to trigger again Beers capitulate the woman to trigger control and"
"12385090","12388470"," that's when you get another push it might not be a new high on the day But that's where you"
"12388470","12396490"," usually get another nice And we should probably tell people just You know, it's funny here is that"
"12396490","12402850"," um You set this trade up and then the one thing that people never do is they never put the"
"12402850","12408970"," stop loss on No, I immediately put it on so right now So they're saying what you're saying I think"
"12408970","12413370"," what he's saying is you're looking for this move down here You buy the calls call whatever you're"
"12413370","12414730"," doing call spreads contracts."
"12415070","12425940"," Yes Um You get the retest here Call me You"
"12425940","12430200"," buy the you buy the calls let's say buying calls by calls right here you come up look for this"
"12430200","12436400"," retest Um, it needs to break above that if we do break above here that the the move is going"
"12436400","12442280"," to be You know right there You have to though remember the 10 cent call stop for the 10 cent"
"12442280","12449880"," stop loss So if we start to break below the whole thing here I think one second brother You can"
"12449880","12459730"," see it right here Do you have to have a stop loss under here because if we start to trade"
"12459730","12465230"," sideways and below this blue line Uh, there'll be a reverse a reverse will take place on the hourly"
"12466290","12473790"," Exactly exactly You don't want to see price break below But most likely Nine at a 10 times it's"
"12473790","12479210"," gonna patch You're 83 11 it's gonna attach support right there And then it's gonna break above the"
"12479210","12483630"," one with the trigger And then push up either a new high or or at least another nice move up"
"12483630","12490830"," So now notice how Pass like 10 candles 10 woman of candles or so i've been rejecting against the"
"12490830","12497290"," woman the trigger Yeah So beer still has control so What usually happens in this situation is that"
"12497290","12502950"," the lead price down as far as it can go Which is only three three eleven right now So that's"
"12502950","12508230"," about as much damage as they can do right now Once price bounces off three to three eleven you read"
"12508230","12515750"," you regenerate five in a velocity So basically need a velocity reset which doesn't happen Remember"
"12515750","12519890"," how we get in close above Uh, 384 at 1230. "
"12520050","12525630"," Yeah So there wasn't enough velocity to keep pushing up so you need to reset velocity How do you do"
"12525630","12525830"," that?"
"12526190","12530870"," You come back down to the five minute trigger And then bounce off it and you break right through"
"12530870","12536070"," the one minute trigger Which beers had control and will capitulate and that that resets velocity"
"12536770","12542290"," And that's when you get a strong push up So I wouldn't even buy anything even if price does break"
"12542290","12552550"," above the woman to trigger again I wouldn't buy it Yeah, you missed the trade Yeah, so"
"12552550","12554210"," I'm setting up a trigger now."
"12554330","12561310"," I'm going to be buying 383.10 I'm gonna have a stop loss that literally three three point zero Um,"
"12562110","12564970"," and even if it comes back down comes right back above."
"12565170","12568410"," I'll buy it again I'll do it three times if I need to you know until I get the trade"
"12568930","12573770"," Um, so I'm gonna buy three three point ten three to two point fifteen stop loss at three three"
"12573770","12580470"," point zero zero And I'm gonna take and and then I'm gonna watch price move back up Break above the"
"12580470","12585650"," woman it trigger and push up either a new high end day or at least another you know, it's give"
"12585650","12591070"," me 77 So that's what I'm looking for. "
"12591230","12598170"," Yeah Now if price breaks up breaks above the woman the trigger it could make a push higher But it's"
"12598170","12600750"," not worth the risk of order risk reward ratio."
"12600970","12606450"," Yeah, I agree with I I miss trades all time for the same reason Yeah Yeah, I know you do"
"12609490","12610250"," Patience baby."
"12610630","12615450"," I want high high probability money makers Exactly. "
"12615450","12620230"," So that's every I mean I hit the trade this morning You know, you get out once that woman triggered"
"12620230","12625170"," trajectory starts to turn down And then you know, there's one more trade and that trade is only a"
"12625170","12627490"," five trigger Which is now three three point fifteen."
"12627590","12633870"," So it's going to move up about five cents every five Um, now there's a possibility that bulls take"
"12633870","12638590"," control again at the woman the trigger If you'll notice the woman a trigger start to turn back up"
"12638590","12638850"," again."
"12639030","12645550"," Yeah, they're taking control of right now They're taking control right now, but I don't think So"
"12645550","12651150"," you're saying it's not a lot of velocity There's two possibilities there one is that price came"
"12651150","12658430"," back down Close enough to the five minute trigger to consider it tapping it Um, so it came down to"
"12658430","12662910"," three three point point seven Five minute trigger was at that time was three to three point zero"
"12662910","12663250"," seven. "
"12663250","12664770"," So it was only 20 cents away."
"12664850","12667510"," Yeah, it's pretty close Yeah, it's pretty close."
"12667510","12671870"," See you could say that was the buy Usually it'll make full contact though. "
"12671870","12672930"," So I don't trust this."
"12673070","12678310"," I don't know if it's just going to be pumping You can see this very little velocity right now like"
"12678310","12680470"," the moves aren't sharp fast volatile."
"12680750","12688150"," Nothing at all It'll only get It'll only get faster and and with more velocity once price really"
"12688150","12692290"," hits that three to three point 15 So i'm going to wait, you know, if there's no trades rest of"
"12692290","12693410"," the day, there's no trades rest today. "
"12693410","12698510"," Yeah Yeah Take these brother appreciate the explanation."
"12698530","12699930"," I'll be right here watching in the comments."
"12700110","12726640"," All right, bro later You"
"12726640","12754560"," guys able to fall along with that conversation that we were having Was"
"12754560","12755220"," that good for you guys?"
"12766320","12776110"," Yeah So he's basically telling you that it was close enough to this we were close enough to the"
"12776110","12784600"," trigger down here That we might get the velocity that we need to make that move higher And tag this"
"12784600","12788460"," upper upper bound up here That's actually moved higher now. "
"12788460","12802140"," It's even higher It's now up here But"
"12802140","12806120"," he's also saying that you know, he's saying that it's close enough that it could have been it could"
"12806120","12814300"," have been close enough for the move higher here But that what his roof or his own rules He's unsure"
"12814300","12820180"," that this has the velocity that it actually needs to get up here So it could have a chance of"
"12820180","12827380"," a chance of failing at some point Um that is preferred would be that you touch it and that's where"
"12827380","12842940"," you get the velocity for that move higher that the boom that you need Another"
"12842940","12845840"," it was five minute ema is going as low as it was."
"12846380","12858240"," Oh, you know what I did was I changed mine to uh I changed mine to 27 There"
"12858240","12868160"," there's 21 right there I changed mine from 21 to 27 So"
"12868160","12877520"," here's your five minute trigger right there That's the 21 to get me Came right off on it"
"12877520","12887160"," A few minutes ago I switched over to the Oh, okay"
"12889860","12906800"," Hold on one second here Shit You"
"12945600","12955420"," Oh, hello, it's like there Right there"
"12963300","12965200"," Now I'm in the camp of the bears."
"12965440","12968900"," I'm like just roll over one more time for me come back down here. "
"12969420","13020440"," I want my trade down here I"
"13034480","13059470"," Hate chatting how are you happy holidays brother hope all is well in your family No, I"
"13059470","13066910"," wanted so what I wanted was Uh, I want to say there's no velocity in this trade supposedly right or"
"13066910","13075710"," this is the thesis Is that it should have come down and touched right around here For the best"
"13075710","13082770"," setup on this trade Uh, and then we would have made the move higher here And if it didn't come"
"13082770","13090370"," down there, there's some more risk I guess in In this trade higher failing so you get the attempt"
"13090370","13095070"," and then the rollover Uh, now that doesn't mean this trade fails."
"13095430","13097970"," It just means that it's not the prime trade, right?"
"13098270","13103430"," Talking about if you're only to make in two three or four trades in a day That you're looking for"
"13103430","13108670"," just the best setups So you can get left behind in these trades if you don't if you decide i'm"
"13108670","13113440"," not taking that trade Right, it looks like it's going higher."
"13113600","13121760"," It doesn't look like it's gonna fail Yeah, it was very close to Uh, it was very close on the"
"13121760","13131580"," emas When the 21 emate it showed itself right here right on the one minute and then it showed"
"13131580","13139880"," itself on the five minute It rocketed right here right got picked right up for the for the move"
"13139880","13150080"," higher This is the five-minute chart mea mute the Look map here for you So"
"13150080","13159180"," this is the 21 ema And we rocket shipped Came down tested it down the five we wrote we rolled"
"13159180","13170510"," in the one minute And then found the velocity that it needs to get up here now the"
"13170510","13180420"," velocity trigger is lower for for For the anemo trade it's it's a little bit"
"13180420","13187500"," lower than right here So you so you the anemo is saying you would have wanted This to come down"
"13187500","13192400"," a little bit more to get that actual push that you need To get higher now if it was only"
"13192400","13198340"," 20 cents away from where it should have been So if you're talking like hand grenades and horseshoes"
"13199080","13204600"," Was this good enough becomes the question becomes was this good enough to make this like higher?"
"13206840","13213960"," I just toward what we're basically cutting or mick or mincing or where you know what we're talking"
"13223840","13233420"," Talking you know how often does this fail let's say this might fail Uh, let's say this fails"
"13233420","13241780"," three times Out of 10 right, but if you were to come down here it might only fail One side"
"13241780","13247700"," of 10 times does that make sense So you're just looking for that perfect perfect setup you're not"
"13247700","13261260"," gonna always get it Yep,"
"13261580","13269410"," there's a getting torched here and the pain trade is on it looks like the pain trade is on It"
"13269410","13271570"," looks to me like the pain trade is on now. "
"13271730","13278590"," This is all going to become a pain trade Because you've got you've got shorts that are definitely"
"13278590","13286130"," trapped right here if they weren't trapped earlier on the open They're definitely trapped The key"
"13286130","13286430"," here."
"13286530","13292510"," What are the key things about this is You got some real you got some shorts that are trapped in"
"13292510","13299750"," here and if they start to see us move higher here This is when the panic will step we'll step"
"13299750","13307270"," in right If you don't have this breakdown here we start heading up This is when the pain trade"
"13307270","13312450"," begins like this may some real pain in here and it should be a fast move up when it happens"
"13313970","13319350"," It should be a fast we'll go straight north here to 385 And the crazy part is if you get"
"13319350","13329160"," above 385 It's going to be a quick trip to 388 So if you're a bear"
"13329160","13335880"," out there be careful we said that earlier right this whole trade right here this move right here I"
"13336920","13342040"," Erased a bunch of this stuff, but I had a I had a yellow line back here if you go"
"13342040","13345460"," back into the broadcast I had a yellow line right here and I was like bears."
"13345800","13350740"," You don't want to give that up right there And I was like if the bears give this up right"
"13350740","13354880"," here Was like it's pawn and you should have cut short right above here, right?"
"13355160","13361520"," So what happened this happened yesterday to bulls right from this happened to bulls On the inverse"
"13368020","13371140"," Yeah, I agree with you James James is saying he's still waiting for that. "
"13371480","13373620"," He's saying he's not long I'm not long either."
"13373700","13374560"," I'm just sitting here wait."
"13374740","13381740"," Well, I've got some calls But they're not for day trading therefore There for that almighty"
"13381740","13394570"," Valhalla 388 up there But"
"13394570","13407780"," the these these these right here like I want this right here Take"
"13407780","13421110"," a look back on the five minutes see if the line is still good I Gonna"
"13421110","13432380"," move it back to the 27 real quick Matter of fact"
"13432380","13435360"," here comes that uh Here comes Jamie Mike. "
"13435360","13446120"," We might actually get it brother Coming up right now Moving up right now brother I"
"13454730","13463920"," Some eyeball on this right here Don't it won't be 383 10."
"13464080","13470820"," It'll be a different price now, but So i'm gonna get rid of the 383 because it moved well as"
"13470820","13498530"," soon as this moves just keeps training up here so I'm looking for that blue line right there Yeah"
"13498530","13509920"," Yeah, james saying there's no velocity for a new high this is"
"13509920","13516490"," great to do I like I like talking with james when we talk about these trades because it's a great"
"13517310","13526230"," learning This is a great learning experience to be talking about the mechanics of this trade And"
"13526230","13529990"," did you take the long did you not take the long what are you looking for to take the long"
"13529990","13555910"," all that kind of stuff I'm"
"13555910","13556310"," reading brother."
"13559520","13562180"," Yeah, he's he's making another comment too here. "
"13562180","13571500"," He's saying Another way to express this trade would be You go to the one minute here, right?"
"13588060","13599470"," Okay, you'd go to the five minute and"
"13600330","13612870"," Come on here You'd wait for the you'd wait for the He's"
"13612870","13615690"," saying you wait for the you'd wait for the touchdown below, right?"
"13616590","13621630"," And then you wait for it to break above the one minute then you take the trade so He's saying"
"13621630","13626710"," you can wait for it to touch here Don't take it yet though until it breaks above the one minute"
"13627890","13638240"," Um, so right now is where so it's touching finally right now On the five minute We're"
"13638240","13645260"," getting the touch right now And you'd wait for if you want if you even want to do the 10"
"13645260","13654000"," cents top loss You'd wait to enter calls until we break above this for confirmation Does that make"
"13654000","13654160"," sense?"
"13660050","13666630"," So you're looking to see if we break above the one minute here So we'll go back to the one"
"13666630","13679190"," minute timeline And you"
"13679190","13685310"," would wait for confirmation to see if there's If we're going to be sell the market here or if we're"
"13685310","13695190"," going to you would take this trade after confirmation Wonder if I can mimic this"
"13695190","13715800"," with the EMA with the moving average hold on here Just a second here Right"
"13715800","13725160"," there that might work I think that would work right there And the style would be blue color would"
"13725160","13735830"," be blue I Think that works You"
"13735830","13743890"," don't want to see a break of this blue line right here I'll change the color to green I kind"
"13743890","13756670"," of like that green that kind of works right there Let"
"13756670","13768700"," me see it meet this on the hook map real quick So I'll show it to you here You"
"13768700","13782760"," See that touchdown below right there to that power move right here So you don't want to see So"
"13782760","13791030"," you can clean this up for you Right there you guys see it out there So if this green line"
"13791030","13801750"," holds and it breaks above this blue line right here, it's off to the races Sweet Sweet"
"13804030","13833940"," All right,"
"13834020","13843770"," I'm on calls baby Now I'm in some calls here What am I looking for here"
"13843770","13845790"," is a stop loss, right?"
"13846070","13860490"," So I'm going to put a stop loss in here And"
"13860490","13864530"," you know, I don't want to see this I don't want to see this fail at the one minute I"
"13864530","13875800"," want to see it go above the one minute here Hold on I want"
"13875800","13877540"," to see this move break through the one minute."
"13877620","13887220"," I want to see the bears lose the one minute And then get the velocity we need here Now You"
"13887220","13891340"," should if we can't gain the one minute, you're going to have to cut it loose, right?"
"13891500","13898060"," If you can't You see what I'm saying if if the goals can't take over that one minute You'll have"
"13898060","13908020"," to cut the trade loose So let's see what happens If"
"13908020","13913960"," you don't, you know, I'm not recommending for you to fall that trade you could paper trade it Or"
"13913960","13922660"," you just watch and see if it works or not You can do your own stop losses at home if"
"13922660","13929060"," you're watching right now And we'll see if this is the push of the bulls get I know it's probably"
"13929060","13945170"," bears out there right now going Blue line I've"
"13945170","13955620"," got 384 C's for today Oh, baby"

"14057340","14086060"," Don't be don't be giving money back to the house You"
"14086060","14092300"," James also gave an answer here saying if this blue line and this green line You can wait until we"
"14092300","14102200"," get above the blue line to take the trade but more safety Up here the bears"
"14102200","14113600"," are like you ain't getting up there Bears"
"14113600","14117820"," are like no The bears are all down here."

"14177180","14182800"," He's like I'm not saying that I actually own a bunch of calls for 3889 or 388 But I might"
"14182800","14201250"," own a bunch of calls for 388 Yeah, so"
"14201250","14207830"," they're saying can both lines cross yeah, but I guess what he's saying is the safety trade here Is"
"14207830","14213590"," above the blue line So you can wait you don't have to actually buy this green line down here He's"
"14213590","14216130"," saying that well you can with a stop loss below right?"
"14216610","14223270"," So you buy the green line You put a stop loss down below then you move your stops up right"
"14225530","14230450"," Or the second way to express this trade is you enter it right now over the blue line and for"

"14411980","14416900"," can see that the move from this morning Right down here."
"14417060","14422100"," You got almost the touchdown here Broke above so you can see the green and the blue line right here"
"14422740","14427280"," And then it was just pumping off to the races And you can see they were back down here again"
"14427280","14446070"," in this same The same trajectory right here Another"
"14446070","14451330"," note that uh james had made earlier was you want to keep your eye on this ema here this this"
"14451330","14457550"," blue one right here You don't want this to turn around like you start to see it roll over And"
"14457550","14465090"," chase starts to chase this money down Um, you cut your stops and try to re-enter once again. "
"14466390","14476770"," I don't agree on the green line And"
"14476770","14484270"," what you don't want to see home she's texting me right now So he's saying that uh now he's saying"
"14484270","14488970"," I think that it still needs to get tighter before the real move up before a real move up So"
"14488970","14493750"," he's saying that he thinks he wants to see the He wants to see the green line come up some"
"14493750","14501070"," more He wants to see this blue line come down some more and see this this uh this volatility enter"
"14505480","14509280"," So to move that out of the way so you can see both lines as they interact with each other"
"14513360","14522660"," And I want to see if this green line is the same as i've got on the five It's close"

"14561050","14568930"," closes here, uh predicted this The hourly closes predicted this move down lower And then you notice"
"14568930","14579540"," that it failed up here right and then it failed again That's"

"17382520","17391680"," a key level right here for apple to get up above and push higher And uh, I don't know was"
"17391680","17392920"," it Dylan that said this earlier."
"17393300","17397240"," I don't know exactly who said this earlier Could have been john haggard."
"17397280","17402700"," He had said this earlier So john had said we'll talk about john had what we'll tell what john is"
"17402700","17409780"," saying Um, someone asked what tomorrow looks like There's a few things. "
"17410340","17410780"," Okay."
"17410900","17419780"," It's a few things you need to know about tomorrow You're ready for it Okay, so this is the idea"
"17419780","17430620"," for tomorrow and believe it or not Um The first we're going to talk about It's"
"17430620","17437700"," a good time to talk about this Is this not insanity?"
"17438600","17448380"," Tell me this is an insanity Tell me this isn't just this is ridiculous You tell him you're going to"
"17448380","17458260"," try to tell me that this is not ridiculous So a bunch of day traders in here just"
"17458260","17465040"," getting smoked and making bank Tell me this is not just ridiculous That's just stupid."
"17465180","17477960"," Isn't it That is stupid Absolutely stupid Obsertity"
"17479900","17483820"," Uh jpm collar we've got expires tomorrow, right?"
"17484000","17494760"," So we know about the jpm collar We also have We have the jpm collar coming off tomorrow Now"
"17496480","17506420"," The other thing about tomorrow is You can see You don't we don't"
"17506420","17508640"," nest we don't always pin to the jpm collar. "
"17508640","17514160"," I want to be clear on that We have pinned to the jpm car, but we don't always Also any"
"17514160","17520620"," of you that have been in the market long enough knows that the jpm collar in years past Has not"
"17520620","17525380"," been to the pin ever It's actually an inefficient way to hedge the market too."
"17525380","17530580"," So we probably don't know that either There are better ways to hedge the market then anyways get"
"17530580","17540560"," past all that But Traders have the past probably year maybe a year and a half It started to"
"17540560","17545840"," pick up gain traction to follow the jpm collar sometime in like jid july or september of last year"
"17547700","17550940"," So it's become become it's been becoming truer and truer."
"17551120","17557900"," So there's a couple of points that we made about that If if we hedge if you people are going"
"17557900","17565300"," to be looking for where that collar is And when that collar is traded People will follow that"
"17565300","17566900"," collar as well collar as well. "
"17567000","17569280"," There's usually a couple of things that happen."
"17569280","17572460"," Just pretend this is a A blank box over here."
"17572540","17577520"," Okay Uh, when a hedge comes on and if it puts that are much lower, you'll see an immediate if"
"17577520","17578200"," it's down, right?"
"17578360","17583320"," You'll see an immediate move down in the market You'll see delta hedging by dealers that'll"
"17583320","17589020"," actually raise the price Okay If you start to see like bunch of hedges coming on the market, it can"
"17589020","17595460"," be a down day tomorrow just based on that Uh, but we will tend to swing high though anyways So"
"17595460","17600540"," if you see a collar like jpm collar, you'll sometimes see it uh impact the market down, right?"
"17600820","17605180"," And then a big move up And then the down move to where the collar is over here. "
"17605440","17610280"," This is over time though Uh, this is actually a smaller time frame right here, but you don't have"
"17610280","17617120"," to see the market move higher So for tomorrow's trade Uh That's the next thing that you're looking"
"17617120","17621980"," for is is the is the collar going to be deep at like 3000 Is it going to be at"
"17621980","17622660"," 2,400?"
"17623260","17624200"," Everyone wants to know right?"
"17625100","17634080"," Uh, there's want to know and honestly wherever that collar is Could set the market on fire higher"
"17635800","17644220"," If there's if that collar is not that low if that collar is like 330 or 350 Um, it could"
"17644220","17649280"," it could trigger the market to explode higher So I don't think it's going to be hot a high collar."
"17649420","17652500"," I think it's going to be low If I had to put a guess out there, it's I'm probably going"
"17652500","17662020"," to put it at Uh If I was going to put the collar on I'd put it on for The"
"17662020","17670240"," weekly moving average It may be slightly below it and that's only at 350 So I don't know uh 3 "
"17670240","17679420",",100 seems kind of steep Or it seems dangerous Uh for where we are in the market I'm interested to"
"17679420","17685490"," see what the collar is tomorrow Because I would expect that maybe they know better that we're going"
"17685490","17694210"," to sell the weekly moving average Okay, so If you put the 3,100 to put like a 3,200"
"17694210","17697870"," collar on the market That'd be hard."
"17698190","17700930"," I'm wondering if they're going to put the collar at like 30. "
"17701190","17703670"," I think it's 35-6 or something That's what I'm going to get."
"17703790","17710690"," That's what my best My best guess is the collar will be at the um We'll be at we'll be"
"17710690","17715250"," at the Weekly moving average it would be risky."
"17715550","17721570"," I would think to put it below The weekly moving average you could get a surprise tomorrow on the"
"17721570","17729470"," collar anyways Uh my fear there though is that there'll be My fear there though is that there'll be"
"17729470","17735530"," a if the collar is not low enough There could be just a market reaction that this is bottom even"
"17735530","17740830"," if it's fake Uh so we could get it apart from that to be aware of that collar as it"
"17740830","17746350"," as it makes its way around social media Uh, although the two collars they have right now are much"
"17746350","17748550"," lower They have a collar for January and February. "
"17748770","17753530"," I think that are like really low They're like I don't know remember what they are off the top of"
"17753530","17757250"," my head, but I used to have them I don't I don't know where the numbers are right now But"
"17757250","17762890"," they have two more collars out right now that are much I believe much lower on the market So you"
"17762890","17764190"," should seek those out as well."
"17764370","17771670"," I'll look them up myself I think there's a January and a February collar So I'll look them up And"
"17771670","17781530"," what their price targets are does anybody know what they are Uh now the next thing that we have is"
"17781530","17791470"," the Whether you agree with it or not We have the There's talk"
"17791470","17799770"," out there that There are yearly puts coming off tesla and that that would create A rally in"
"17799770","17807790"," January, February So you have that to contend with and you have you also have to contend with Um,"
"17808310","17814630"," are they rolling those puts into new put positions because that would invalidate The tesla puts"
"17814630","17815570"," coming off argument."
"17815750","17816850"," So keep that in mind too. "
"17817010","17824190"," If you have access to some flow Uh flow software you want to be looking tomorrow to see if major"
"17824190","17831130"," puts are coming on tesla Pay attention to social media if they're talking about it Uh and where"
"17831130","17837810"," those where those those puts are at if they're like year out Three month out puts on tesla on a"
"17837810","17842770"," low Now you want to pay attention to that stuff, but doesn't mean we go there right now."
"17843070","17847110"," Usually they trade in versus You'll see dealers will force."
"17847370","17848630"," I don't know how much you guys know about this stuff. "
"17848750","17856090"," So like, um If I buy 10 million dollars in puts, right Let's say I buy a 10 million dollars"
"17856090","17861290"," and 3000 puts The dealers will counter that trade."
"17861670","17863950"," They express that in different ways, right?"
"17864130","17868310"," They can buy the market to counter that trade What what the deal?"
"17868510","17871030"," So i'm just gonna say i tried to simplify this for somebody yesterday."
"17871490","17878690"," So If I buy 10 million dollars and puts 3000 puts, right, let's just say 300 puts expiring in three"
"17878690","17885990"," months Uh, the dealers and market makers, they're not going to pay me for that to go there, right?"
"17886170","17891030"," They don't want it to go there Um, so they have to be the inverse of that trade What the"
"17891030","17897530"," dealers and market makers want me to do is to go out there and find somebody else That believes"
"17897530","17903690"," that we're going to 3000 Right so that they buy 10 million dollars and puts does that make sense 10"
"17903690","17909470"," million dollars and 3000 puts And then for us to actually get there you need a third person in a"
"17909470","17916250"," fourth person in a fifth person in a sixth person And a seventh person And crazily crazily enough"
"17916250","17922050"," if we start trading down to that 3000 You actually need more people to start to buy puts lower than"
"17922050","17927910"," 3000 For the velocity to get down to actually hit that 3000 Now that original bag that I bought"
"17927910","17933890"," that was empty Right there's an empty bag and I got the 3000 puts I'm going to then sell them"
"17933890","17939050"," to somebody else and say look there's plenty of room in here We're going to 3000. "
"17939210","17941690"," I want you to buy my bag Does that make sense?"
"17942290","17947490"," So I sell out and you buy them from me Right So now you've got the bag and we're we're"
"17947490","17953950"," getting closer and closer and closer and you have to find somebody else To buy that bag at 3000 and"
"17953950","17961710"," you need more people now to buy 2500 peas Right And so do you understand that's where that put wall"
"17961710","17965270"," comes into the into the market and that's where you want to put wall expansion and that kind of"
"17965270","17973150"," stuff so um My point being is Important tomorrow to see what what puts are coming into the market."
"17973510","17981290"," It's important to see Uh follow through on those puts um and you need to see like Normally the"
"17981290","17988630"," market's going to rise up if we have like crazy low targets on the market And that's what we're"
"17988630","17993690"," bagholding comes from so that last person you're the last person that's chasing those 3000 puts"
"17994370","17999350"," Sits there and I'm sitting in the bags almost full and I go I promise you There's enough room left"
"17999350","18004670"," for you to get just a little bit more out of those bags Right And you're like okay."
"18004770","18009970"," I'll take the risk on those puts And you didn't realize that you're the only guy standing in line"
"18009970","18015930"," for those puts And so you grab those puts And those 3000 puts right and meanwhile everybody"
"18015930","18021310"," switched to the call side And the market makers need a fucking bag holder and so you become the bag"
"18021310","18023830"," holder On those puts does that make sense?"
"18025210","18026850"," Is that an easy way to describe this?"
"18041250","18047250"," So that's my point about tomorrow is like what would what should you be tomorrow Into tomorrow?"
"18047670","18055830"," I don't know Uh Personally, I wouldn't trade tomorrow I wouldn't be surprised to see the market"
"18055830","18062810"," trade sideways and get swung up and down Uh I wouldn't be in a position for tomorrow. "
"18063190","18070230"," I would be flat into tomorrow If you wanted to take a long on a stock tomorrow, I would be"
"18070230","18080060"," looking for your biggest losers of the year You could possibly see Some"
"18080060","18086640"," shorts get lifted off of the most Dog crap stocks that have been shorted this year And I'd"
"18086640","18093440"," recommend you do it on a quality stock or a perceived quality stock Uh, I would be interested to"
"18093440","18103760"," see some rips in those stocks on the 30th Does"
"18103760","18104120"," it make sense?"
"18104440","18111140"," So if you see a stock that's down like 60 70 80 90 percent this year There's a fair chance"
"18111140","18118500"," that you're gonna see shorts get closed Into tomorrow Uh, and then I'd be I'd be watching the"
"18118500","18124140"," market see what they're saying if you if you don't see rolling puts coming in on tesla Uh, you're"
"18124140","18130820"," gonna expect that those puts to roll off in january and and that squeeze to happen in tesla If uh,"
"18131280","18135880"," you need to see what what the what the banks are doing and trade off what they're saying When that"
"18135880","18141140"," jpm collar comes and you can usually trade the market up So I would expect to see a rip on"
"18142500","18152470"," um I would expect to see a rip start like the second third and fourth somewhere in"
"18152470","18156890"," there I don't know if the market's open in the second, but Uh, whenever we reopen the market after"
"18156890","18164370"," nears if if the usually the first few days you get a ramp even on the the collar Usually you'll"
"18164370","18174250"," get a ramp Chase chase is"
"18174250","18180330"," so mad right now Dby what?"
"18182850","18188290"," Yeah, you'll see sometimes is uh, you'll see you'll see these banks remove their uh shorts And let"
"18188290","18195350"," the stock rise again so they can reshort it They they have learned the wall street bets game And"
"18195350","18201910"," what they do is there's certain times of the of the year and quarters that they will um And opex"
"18201910","18207210"," is where they'll let the uh shorts off So what you could do is you know you identify those you"
"18207210","18212990"," grab like 10 or 12 stocks You get a basket of like 10 or 12 the most highly shorted Uh"
"18212990","18221450"," biggest losers of the year You put them on a screener And at tomorrow's 4am open into the nine o "
"18221450","18228150","'clock open You look for high volume in those in those stocks and you'll see it You'll see it happen"
"18228150","18234870"," early usually early not always but And you're just looking for volume all day long Unusual volume"
"18234870","18257750"," on those on those tickers Well, you"
"18257750","18267250"," thought we were done here You thought they were rolling this over Let me call uh, let me get"

"18300500","18309100"," That um I was I was taken I was taken it off right there because just did him like, um"
"18310340","18317160"," I was looking at the market if you look If you look right here if you look right here, you"
"18317160","18318780"," can see i'm looking on the screen."
"18318820","18323320"," I just put up book map And you can see they're coming in right now. "
"18323320","18332460"," There's a big Pretty decent sell order right here So I didn't like the"
"18332460","18341360"," way pest was was looking Um I didn't like the way netflix was looking And I was just I saw"
"18341360","18346460"," some of them other main guns and I just I waited for that one push and I took it but"
"18347160","18354700"," in general, um If you when we set up that trade if you want to buy Three 83.30 with"
"18354700","18360120"," a stop bus that three three point ten Uh, three three point points a ten cent risk you're taking"
"18360120","18367320"," that trade Um, whatever calls you got even right now you'd be up, uh, just about give these easy"
"18367320","18371900"," sense of that trade Yeah, normally I took the train at 40 cents and sold it at 68."
"18371940","18379260"," So I'm pretty happy Yes, and normally in this situation This is a little unusual when you so so you"
"18379260","18383540"," know how I said like you want them to get a little more clustered And tighter together before that"
"18383540","18383800"," break."
"18384340","18390800"," Yeah So that ended up happening except it didn't get the follow through that it normally would get"
"18390800","18398920"," so People watching this for the first time they saw spy go up to three 420 three four 34 Nice"
"18398920","18405240"," push up, but in general they should know that once you get these kind of setups Um, you usually get"
"18405240","18410820"," a move up to make a new high on day And that's when it starts usually moving more powerful more"
"18410820","18415400"," velocity Um, more speed in the moves and so this is unusual. "
"18415400","18419820"," This doesn't usually happen Yeah, you're not really going for like a 50 cent move."
"18419820","18426900"," They don't like a dollar to two dollar Yeah, there's one of the one of the regular traders in the"
"18426900","18428540"," group is saying john haggard."
"18428600","18438040"," I think is saying that um He's saying like the classic bull setup You'll get the end of day"
"18438040","18440740"," weakness or middle of the day like you know 230 in the afternoon. "
"18440740","18447300"," Now you're the market rolls over And so you get that like week end of the day and then you"
"18447300","18456820"," either hit End of day today or it saves itself for tomorrow so I mean The"
"18456820","18462260"," thing is I still don't see Any reason to be sure at this point in time."
"18462320","18463040"," That's what he's saying."
"18463340","18469360"," I think that's what john's point Was too was John I think john's point was like we can hit it"
"18469360","18469620"," today. "
"18469720","18474620"," We can hit it tomorrow yet the middle afternoon weakness And we'll get up there at some point"
"18475240","18475760"," Right."
"18476120","18482740"," So I think the main point here is that Price broke above the hourly trigger today at three Um, it"
"18482740","18488260"," was it was on the open but 380 point 69 So both the hourly trigger."
"18488820","18490060"," I'm never really looking short. "
"18490380","18496860"," I'm always looking for long tips Whether it was like today where I long to get that 3.30 with"
"18496860","18502200"," a stop bus 10 cent risk reward Or you know when five were below the hourly trigger."
"18502220","18508240"," I'll go short with the stop bus right above It's it's all about the mindset above the hourly"
"18508240","18514820"," trigger and trying to long it's not short rips and below the hourly trigger I'm trying to to short"
"18514820","18517800"," bounces not Not long."
"18518000","18521640"," So so if you're listening in right now Do you see this blue line on the hourly?"
"18522980","18528320"," So if you guys can see this blue line right here We're up we're above this blue line right now,"
"18528440","18528540"," right?"
"18528840","18533320"," So he's saying that right now you're trying to buy dips not sell rips Is the point that he's trying"
"18533320","18535220"," to make you you see this blue line right here?"
"18536960","18538180"," It's not even the blue line. "
"18538360","18546200"," No, but I'm saying Yeah, well, this is I agree But this we're with this up this blue line here"
"18546200","18551340"," in the hourly is obscenely Bullish here."
"18551480","18553820"," Do you see it on the I'm showing it to you right now?"
"18555040","18563690"," Oh shit wait my stream wasn't live And you can see this is where the bears want to come in"
"18563690","18585300"," right here See if I can show you this right now Think"
"18585300","18595100"," tight here Yeah, so that's the my off with you right now So are you"
"18595100","18600860"," texting me too Oh, yeah, so this is the this is yeah exactly."
"18601140","18608200"," Yes, it is Yeah, so you the one thing I want to show you in this chart is You see"
"18608200","18614920"," how they came in above here and they they shorted right here at 385 Is shorted right here and he"
"18614920","18624650"," kind of likes, you know bears are like trying to short this right here So you're saying that you"
"18624650","18626170"," buy the dip down here or what?"
"18626890","18633330"," Yeah, so as long as prices above blue line my only mentality is If I see a good dip, I'm"
"18633330","18633890"," gonna go long. "
"18634350","18638970"," So like today we had a good dip to the five minute trigger up here at a 3.30 Now"
"18638970","18644450"," the reason why we need that five minute trigger would be support is because the hourly velocity has"
"18644450","18649430"," been positive all day When hourly velocity is positive The five minute trigger is going to provide"
"18649430","18656930"," a balance over nine out of ten times back tested over 20 years of data When the hourly velocity is"
"18656930","18663310"," positive the five minute trigger will provide support nine at a ten times So once price breaks"
"18663310","18668390"," above hourly trigger, that's always my original long position So you can see it happen very early"
"18668390","18668970"," in the morning today."
"18669130","18673770"," I'm like the first minute of trading price broke above that blue line And that's when I take my"
"18673770","18680290"," first long I sell my long position Once the one minute trigger starts going down."
"18680390","18685850"," Yeah Or go ask where do you see rollover see velocity for free on?"
"18685850","18687110"," APT is calm. "
"18687730","18688750"," That's the name of terminal."
"18689030","18691070"," Justin says what does that blue line set you?"
"18691330","18696070"," It's a proprietary trigger Calculated the math formula."
"18696370","18702610"," It's not any specific EMA you can try to mess around Differently amazing different time frames and"
"18702610","18708690"," try to get something that similar, but you'll never get exactly because it isn't an EMA But my"
"18708690","18714350"," point is that a lot of traders there They look at setups and they're like am I trying to long"
"18714350","18714970"," dips?"
"18714970","18716710"," Am I trying to long ribs?"
"18716930","18717310"," Am I track?"
"18717610","18718470"," Am I trying to short ribs?"
"18719030","18724950"," And all I'm saying is that Using nothing else about an EMOi just the hourly trigger If you just"
"18724950","18730730"," want to use the free version with your favorite socks tesla apple spy It just and your day trading"
"18730730","18735530"," or your swing trading Once price is above the hourly trigger and you're trying to go short most of"
"18735530","18739030"," the time you're going to shoot yourself in the foot Yeah, the prices below the hourly trigger and"
"18739030","18743190"," you're trying to go along most of the time you can shoot yourself in the foot Yeah, so scroll"
"18743190","18749690"," scroll back a bit in your chart like scroll back like maybe like a couple of weeks Using that same"
"18749690","18759780"," line using that same blue line on the one hour for the one hour Yeah You"
"18759780","18763020"," could see over time How it how it's worth?"
"18765120","18772260"," Yeah, I mean when you're over it man, it moves and until you break below it It uh if you're"
"18772260","18777480"," above it If it stays above and you get confirmation or you put your stop loss on it moves And"
"18777480","18784200"," then if you break below it and you get some confirmation, I mean it is bloodbath bill Huge moves up"
"18784200","18791460"," cute this move down here you would have missed right here, but um This one right here would have"
"18791460","18797380"," been trapped in but even so Uh, the number of wins in here is you know, in my effect if"
"18797380","18801000"," you had just held this you would have actually stayed It stayed in your trade. "
"18801460","18809120"," So I guess if if it fails You have a high propensity of it coming back not continuing down it"
"18809120","18815900"," looks like So there's another thing which is daily velocity can tell you if the hourly trigger is"
"18815900","18820320"," going to provide support or resist So just like the hourly velocity tells you if the five minute"
"18820320","18824680"," trigger is going to provide support or resistance The daily velocity tells you if hourly trigger is"
"18824680","18829120"," going to provide support resistance the weekly velocity tells you if the daily Trigger is going to"
"18829120","18829620"," it."
"18829840","18831660"," Yeah, I've got the I've got the daily."
"18832020","18841880"," I've got the daily at uh 387 34 as the instant short So so the the"
"18841880","18848180"," daily trigger on the name was like 3d8 i think 3d8.34 3d.34. Yeah, you can just do the"
"18848180","18852640"," same setting on the on the daily timeframe But my point is just for any swing trader day trader out"
"18852640","18859740"," there Um, anyone is free and if you're and if you're treating Um, you know, you're half half of the"
"18859740","18865380"," guesswork goes out the window your above hourly trigger Look look to long dips if you're below the"
"18865380","18867100"," hourly trigger look to short reps. "
"18867100","18873980"," Yeah, yes, like yes Yeah, yesterday the moment we crop so I put a stop on the on a long"
"18873980","18882000"," yesterday On the hourly and I got stopped out of a long call yesterday And some people stayed in"
"18882000","18890020"," and as the moment that one hour broke down it was over It was like bloodbath bill Yeah and the"
"18890020","18896600"," best trades That that I've ever had was buying on a break above the hourly trigger So let's see the"
"18896600","18899300"," hourly triggers that created point give before like it was this morning."
"18899520","18905740"," Yeah So as soon as five breaks above you can figure stuff lost 10 cents below Trading off triggers"
"18905740","18911640"," is excellent for people that have trouble managing risk Because you never know where to stop out if"
"18911640","18916320"," you don't have a trigger But when you're buying on triggers whether price breaks through a trigger"
"18916320","18921420"," Are you waiting for price to pull down to a trigger and you're going to buy that dip As long"
"18921420","18926300"," as you always have your stop loss 10 cents below where the trigger is you can never lose Because"
"18926300","18929800"," let's say price breaks above the hourly trigger and it fails and it comes right back down You're"
"18929800","18936080"," stopped out immediately For for less than a less than a 5% loss from that 10 cents Right, right."
"18936220","18941360"," Um And and if price breaks above the hourly trigger and it doesn't pull back down Each trigger is"
"18941360","18942520"," an acceleration level. "
"18942820","18948680"," It's the point It's it's a calculated point where you mean motion takes over And it pulls or bears"
"18948680","18954660"," win the battle and it accelerates in that direction So over 90 of the time when you buy a breakup"
"18954660","18960360"," hourly trigger you're going to make a profit So your losses become 5 5% or less and your wins"
"18960360","18966480"," become 10% to infinity You're almost always going to get a least 10% win buying on a break"
"18966480","18970920"," above the trigger and you can do this and let it stop So that's why I like me much so"
"18970920","18971060"," much."
"18971160","18975280"," That's why I'm such a fan Technical analysis leads a lot of uh leaves."
"18975500","18981800"," It leaves a lot of guesswork up there and there's no defined stop losses really But with triggers"
"18981800","18986440"," and once you use them for a while you see how well they work And you know if you go"
"18986440","18990560"," long above a trigger and then price comes back down If you don't stop out you're gonna lose all"
"18990560","18997560"," your money because price will accelerate down Yeah, the big green the big green Line the BGL white"
"18997560","19006220"," paper is very similar Uh in its methodology Yeah, so PGL Uh, it doesn't matter what kind of use but"
"19006220","19010760"," it's a great win in the Maris Absolutely and takes the emotion out of the trick out of your trading"

"19137810","19144570"," one-hour trigger all these 21 emas Or all these 21 ema of respect it's a similar it's a similar"
"19146410","19154970"," It's a similar to so there's a velocity to the market that can give you A there's a velocity in"
"19154970","19155350"," the market."
"19156250","19166440"," So as an example, um So"
"19166440","19177580"," just right here yesterday remember remember yesterday when so yesterday I made a post about um So"
"19178100","19181180"," Here let me see if I can do this on a different time frame here, but this is an hourly"
"19181180","19188760"," chart, okay But uh yesterday or let's go back to the 27th We get some time here."
"19189060","19194400"," So on the 27th, right Uh, we had a we had this huge hammer candle come in it was giant"
"19194400","19197340"," on like a one minute on at three three ten, right?"
"19198020","19207980"," And it was showing that the market was going to That the market was going to go down on The"
"19207980","19216980"," following day, but we went above the hourly trigger here right this this 21 Uh ema we we jumped"
"19216980","19218760"," above above it, right?"
"19219320","19227970"," And if you see this candle right here We traded above Uh the trigger, but we didn't have enough"
"19227970","19235810"," velocity on a smaller time frame Uh to make a leg higher as soon as we reversed here and dumped"
"19235810","19245570"," below this Hourly 21 ema or um We the market switched right we switched velocity in the market"
"19245570","19254070"," and The same point holds here, right you see where we are in the market right now Um, we're buying"
"19254070","19262870"," dips not selling rips is the point That james is making It's not like we traded up to The one"
"19262870","19273480"," hour and now looking for this bloodbath here So if you're a bear right if you're"
"19273480","19283030"," looking to sell the market Like like if you're looking to sell the market right You're actually"
"19283030","19290410"," looking to sell it from here This point here that makes sense not so much here and not so much"
"19290410","19299390"," here, but you're looking to sell it down from this This blue line so even if this rolls over The"
"19299390","19306750"," sure thing trade is underneath this blue line right here Uh, so if you're looking at statistically"
"19306750","19312390"," speaking how many of those trades are going to win Uh, you're not statistically going to win"
"19312390","19314710"," shorting where we are right now does that make sense?"
"19314950","19320230"," I don't know if i'm making sense with that or not Might not be making sense. "
"19320510","19326470"," So their point would be The point would be if you're going to short right where we are right now,"
"19326470","19334630"," it's illogical You shouldn't be shorting this you should be shorting this once you slip under the"
"19334630","19344230"," one hour ema the one hour 21 ma So that's your that's your"
"19344230","19350950"," bearish i'm bearish on the day or i'm bullish on the day now along with that Uh, we're trading"
"19350950","19358610"," above the Uh, the five minute right now right so this green line is actually close to the five"
"19358610","19365410"," minute Uh, 21 ma it's not quite it, but it's close right and see how we're trading above it here."
"19365430","19372430"," We're teeing off it right We teed off here Now if i don't explain this right right now, I think"
"19372430","19379850"," i'm convolute in this but We see we teed off it right here teed off it right here teed off"
"19379850","19386830"," it again right here And we've we've now we've maintained it again Right and we're going to tee off"
"19386830","19395550"," it more than likely again right now Now on an hourly or on a day chart on like a five"
"19395550","19401170"," minute chart As a bear you don't you want let's say you want to short this right you need to"
"19401170","19407770"," get underneath this green line Uh, and you know get some get some follow through right and even"
"19407770","19412230"," then if you take this short, it's not bearish Yet does it make sense?"
"19412810","19417370"," You have to have that hourly swing over with it to give you the velocity to actually get moving in"
"19417370","19424570"," a downward direction So do you waste your time down here probably not right now on a short you're"
"19424570","19432070"," probably not wasting your time on it right now If you want a high probability trade, it's not there"
"19432890","19448650"," It's not in your favor nine out of ten times We're"
"19448650","19455870"," making a video so we're making a video to simplify this for you I'm trying to explain the velocity"
"19455870","19463090"," to you the importance of the velocity behind it as well and how it's Or you can see it You"
"19463090","19464370"," can see it in a one hour here."
"19464630","19471700"," The point that he's trying to make to you is you can see it in a one hour here Do"
"19471700","19478680"," you see do you guys see when When when it's when you actually make the bulk pull on fucking book"
"19478680","19484740"," map You can actually see like so if you're if you're the So like some guys will be like, oh,"
"19484920","19486140"," I should have shorted that right there. "
"19486360","19492220"," Oh, I should have shorted this right here The reality is that the the better trade is in here This"
"19492220","19493660"," is where the money maker is right there."
"19493680","19498180"," That's where the money maker is right there That's where the money maker is right there You don't"
"19498180","19507280"," care about this stuff up here because it can go against you as it did today Right So you want"
"19507280","19513200"," to have that proof of concept before you Um Start that rollover."
"19513360","19517860"," So you see this big blue lines coming up right here right now And so this is not a short"
"19517860","19524340"," the short the rip Uh look right now You need to see it roll back over. "
"19524520","19525940"," You don't care about this part of the move."
"19526120","19529520"," You care about this part of the move Right."
"19530040","19534320"," We always talk on this show about High probability trades. "
"19534860","19536620"," I could give I'll be honest with you."
"19536860","19543520"," I could give two shits About whoever shorted that I could give two shits whoever shorted that This"
"19543520","19549240"," is the short that I'd like to see right here This one see somebody take that short right there is"
"19549240","19557660"," the the good one Um That shorts the good one right there that shorts the good one right there This"
"19557660","19563240"," short probably would have been a no trade day for most people The reason you're saying that is"
"19563240","19570060"," because if you count up like 10 times in the past um You want that you want it to be"
"19570060","19575660"," a winner nine times in a row Not just five times the row not just the hunch Not just oh,"
"19575800","19581480"," I think we're at a top right now that kind of stuff because I think James James's point He's trying"
"19581480","19582080"," to make to you."
"19582220","19582820"," So this is bullish. "
"19583080","19584220"," We're a bullish dance right here."
"19584360","19595100"," If you see You see this blue line come up You see this hourly come up here and"
"19595100","19602520"," you You See a rollover in the market if you see this start to roll into it Right the moment"
"19602520","19607860"," you break through here with some conviction You wouldn't care about this you'd be like you'd be on"
"19607860","19613920"," twitter go and I called the top right here but the reality Is you want to you want to catch"
"19613920","19618380"," it after for that next leg down This is where the juice is and this is where the high"
"19618380","19636550"," probabilityness of that trade working for you comes in I think that's the point he's making No,"
"19636750","19640190"," no, I've got a We're looking at the anemoy."
"19640630","19648810"," It's we're looking at we have an anemoy Uh predictive technology running in the background that"

"21672440","21678700"," and q4 maybe q1 of 2024 So I think they just keep trading the sideways Until we until we get"
"21678700","21680500"," that until we get those unemployment numbers up."
"21680660","21688580"," That's my take on it but But I don't know if we're going up or sideways for 2023 and uh"

"23226840","23235490"," Uh, if they squeeze this up in the overnight, they could they could sell it before open Because"
"23235490","23237010"," i've been having that happen a lot lately."
"23237650","23249900"," Um Be super careful on this close Uh Uh You"
"23249900","23260100"," could you could trade this into the close like Ten cent puts for tomorrow Get"
"23260100","23264500"," add those on the fucking burr on the fire You could probably add ten cent calls on the fire making"
"23264500","23272640"," a 20 cent trade One side is gonna one side as the potential of print like Like a lot of"
"23272640","23285660"," money and then a ton and then there's a potential of Tomorrow a squeeze higher And"
"23285660","23291380"," then like a cell right here Into the open you'd have to take the calls off immediately and then"
"23291380","23302100"," then you could start shorten it down Um The ten cent puts would would at least protect trade If"
"23302100","23310060"," it goes sideways tomorrow And then squeeze is later in the week next week I don't know that's"
"23310060","23311820"," that's that's the other that's the other thing. "
"23311900","23317560"," We just trade sideways slightly down Up into the close and then you get like a big move up on"
"23317560","23324780"," um Like next Wednesday or something But just for shifts and giggles like a lot of trade you made"
"23324780","23333860"," money today for yesterday just a lot of trade some some Ten cent calls and ten cent puts not ten"
"23333860","23343840"," cent 3d3s or 3d8s or 30 cents for tomorrow and uh"
"23345560","23350200"," If they bloodbath this down you held on to it like held them with like diamond hand of them if"
"23350200","23360070"," we start some like bloody tomorrow I bet you could get like They got bloody Shit you could"
"23360070","23369980"," buy like Sick 10 cent literally 10 cent or 20 cent puts It's a great"
"23369980","23371220"," strangle trade in the close."
"23371680","23378680"," The only thing that would invalidate that trade would be Uh sideways open tomorrow There's a high"
"23378680","23380240"," probability of a squeeze open tomorrow."
"23381020","23387120"," So I don't know if they sell it off or not before the open but That's my take for tomorrow"
"23387120","23400000"," squeeze up Uh Uh automatic short I don't"
"23400000","23403740"," know how you translate that yourself, but that's my take on tomorrow. "
"23404860","23417960"," Squeeze it short it I"
"23417960","23424320"," stream five days a week Every market day that we're open, but this week Taking one day off so that"
"23424320","23426080"," I can do some have some stuff for you guys."
"23426220","23430940"," I gotta make and get it up and get it out to you guys So I'm gonna take a day"
"23430940","23441520"," off New years Um, yeah My"
"23441520","23447080"," take on tomorrow is a squeeze up, but I would be warning you so this is the warning is if"
"23447080","23453960"," you don't have a way to short this Uh, you could come back and find that we're opening right here,"
"23453960","23462440"," right Or you could come back and find us in the in the shifts too Uh, so you should probably"
"23462440","23469750"," have the ability to hedge the market It's not guaranteed it's gonna happen, but there's a fair"
"23469750","23474170"," chance we gap up overnight It's probably I'll give it like a 30 to 50 percent chance we gap up"
"23474170","23478650"," overnight was pretty high So there you go."
"23478650","23492330"," You got me take the tomorrow You're off tomorrow Yeah,"

"23517100","23523380"," there's a high probability of a gap up tomorrow I want you all to realize that We have had a"
"23523380","23530420"," training We have had days like this and bloodbath that the next day as well So it's kind of a"
"23530420","23537260"," no-man's land for cash market unless you're getting a strangle on the market You kind of have to be"
"23537260","23540620"," able to strangle it or you have to be able to hedge it in in futures So that's only gonna"
"23540620","23559040"," say it's very risky Uh in the overnight I would expect volatility Jones"
"23559040","23564740"," making a fair point you shouldn't be taking all of your gains and rolling it into the next trade I"
"23564740","23584980"," know people do that do not do that Yeah, I'm"
"23584980","23594520"," watching take your money and run reposition yourself If your calls are in the money buy"

"23649870","23659490"," 377 or 378p for like 10 cents and then um Some"
"23659490","23665590"," 388s for 32 cents something like that make like a 40 cent trade You can probably have to diamond"
"23665590","23672190"," hand one side of it Or depending on you know if we open on the gap up I would monetize"
"23672190","23687130"," the calls and then hold the puts You"
"23687130","23689110"," know, there's this here too, right?"
"23689770","23696070"," If they sell this overnight And then they pick the trade back up right if the blue line comes up"
"23696070","23697530"," you could see that right?"
"23697810","23702570"," This is what I was talking about the The violent sell down could see that violent sell down in the"
"23702570","23712490"," overnight That puts us at 382 Uh if he broke"
