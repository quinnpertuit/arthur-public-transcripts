"GLvTeJQE018","0","8240"," Good evening, traders. This is Captain Jim James with your daily brief. I think I have"
"GLvTeJQE018","8240","12920"," to do them quite frequently for the rest of the week. I'm surprised that on Thanksgiving"
"GLvTeJQE018","12920","19760"," week, that's the case, but so be it. We'll do it live, right? As one of those old guys"
"GLvTeJQE018","19760","26200"," said. I was going to do a daily briefer tonight for what's going to happen tomorrow, but"
"GLvTeJQE018","26200","33640"," I thought it would be better to touch on a subject that's similar to asking someone"
"GLvTeJQE018","33640","41720"," who's been trading a while, what's the difference between a share and a stock? I think off the"
"GLvTeJQE018","41720","47560"," coffee, be surprised that the answers you get from people that know what they're doing"
"GLvTeJQE018","47560","55120"," or think they know what they're doing. And so I think that is important to how today"
"GLvTeJQE018","55120","67280"," played up. Today's market was actually very stable. And a lot of seasoned traders knew"
"GLvTeJQE018","67280","73840"," how to trade today. Yesterday was really rough or the day before, which was what, Monday?"
"GLvTeJQE018","73840","81080"," Oh no, wait a minute. Yeah, Monday was a tough day to trade if you were a seasoned"
"GLvTeJQE018","81160","87600"," trader. You'll probably hear bears say they got the leg up on Monday. I know that's not"
"GLvTeJQE018","87600","96600"," the case. I was active in some places with many seasoned traders on both sides that were"
"GLvTeJQE018","96600","107360"," caught off guard. But Tuesday was a very stable market. And even though it went down, it was"
"GLvTeJQE018","107440","117600"," a stable. Monday was a very weird, tough trade because there were a lot of bears that shorted"
"GLvTeJQE018","117600","123000"," this market right at open. There were a lot of bulls that didn't trade the market right"
"GLvTeJQE018","123000","129240"," at Oak. Monday looked like a trend day. And when you see what happened on Monday at that"
"GLvTeJQE018","129240","135440"," time of the day, it was very unusual. It happens a few times a year, but sometimes"
"GLvTeJQE018","135440","139560"," you'll see it happen and it'll come right back in like 20 minutes. You can't panic."
"GLvTeJQE018","139560","146400"," I think even in a video earlier in the week, I said there may be a drop and don't panic."
"GLvTeJQE018","146400","151800"," It would be a moment for you to get out of your positions or take it long to save your"
"GLvTeJQE018","151800","156800"," ass or whatever. And that actually, I think that was a video or two ago on the main regular"
"GLvTeJQE018","156800","164360"," channel. So my point is this, is that we're going to go right down to the open of a day"
"GLvTeJQE018","164360","168760"," and how the day begins and where it can go. But on a macro level, we're going to look"
"GLvTeJQE018","168760","177480"," at what a year is and or an event, right, a massive event. So we had an event in 2020."
"GLvTeJQE018","177480","185200"," We had the COVID crisis or whatever, right? Dump here. And it was pretty fucking doom"
"GLvTeJQE018","185200","192640"," and gloom. Like when this happened back here, we knew we were topping back here. And when"
"GLvTeJQE018","192640","198440"," it did finally dump, I remember when we were really down low down here, that it was ugly."
"GLvTeJQE018","198440","204840"," I mean, it was, it was ugly. You had like, you had like hardcore bears making, I remember"
"GLvTeJQE018","204840","212480"," some bears were making, like, I don't know, literally like 1000 bucks turned into 50,000."
"GLvTeJQE018","212480","220400"," 20,000 then turned into 100,000. I mean, you talking bank millionaires, retail, small"
"GLvTeJQE018","220400","229760"," time retail traders. And when the announcement was made down here, no one believed it bears,"
"GLvTeJQE018","229760","237440"," bears lost fortunes. I know they did. I know of some of them. And it was like being slapped"
"GLvTeJQE018","237440","247720"," across the face. Now, what's important about that is we were slapped back into a trend and"
"GLvTeJQE018","247720","253320"," this trend has continued for we had two years, right? We come into the end of this year, we had"
"GLvTeJQE018","253320","260200"," a trend of two years in a channel. So what you want to understand is that on a macro level,"
"GLvTeJQE018","260200","274040"," we trade in a channel, in a trend, it's up sideways, it can be down. A good example of a stock that"
"GLvTeJQE018","274040","281880"," trade sideways sometimes is Amazon. I think it wasn't going to save for the last year or so,"
"GLvTeJQE018","281880","291160"," they had a defined trade trading channel. You'll see stocks that only trend flat and make a move"
"GLvTeJQE018","291160","298280"," every once in a while. And so on a grand scale, you can go in these super cycles, you can go in"
"GLvTeJQE018","298280","303880"," cycles that are five years. But if you're going like a year cycle, right, just keeping it simple."
"GLvTeJQE018","305480","310680"," You know that you're in this trend, like you break into this trend here in March, right? And"
"GLvTeJQE018","310680","316840"," you're starting to make yourself a trend. And then there's questions if we're going to keep trending"
"GLvTeJQE018","316840","322040"," up here in 2021, right? And then the next question is we're going to trend like this in 2022,"
"GLvTeJQE018","322600","327880"," say if they start asking yourself questions, right? What's the outlook for 2022? You're going to hear"
"GLvTeJQE018","328440","332440"," news people tell you, you're going to hear the market tell you, you have people lying to you,"
"GLvTeJQE018","333160","339560"," you have narratives. And there's this old trader adage that you trade wherever it's at"
"GLvTeJQE018","340520","346680"," until it doesn't work anymore. So you trade this down until it doesn't work. And then when it starts"
"GLvTeJQE018","346680","353400"," to turn, you take this trade and you trade it until it doesn't work anymore. And that does apply in a"
"GLvTeJQE018","353400","359320"," grand scale to where we are right now. Now there are other factors on a very simple"
"GLvTeJQE018","360200","368360"," basic level. And that is you have to think from where a bank comes from. Now you'll see this on a"
"GLvTeJQE018","368360","375560"," better scale on stocks. If they're an IPO, if you don't know, like I tried to trade one stock at a"
"GLvTeJQE018","375560","382520"," time, you want to get to know that stock, ask people about it. You want to know in a grand"
"GLvTeJQE018","382520","389160"," scale, are they in a growth phase, are they an IPO? How are their earnings, right? How are their"
"GLvTeJQE018","390360","395160"," P's trading? You know, how many times over their profit of their trading year? Anyways,"
"GLvTeJQE018","396440","399400"," things you want to learn about a stock, right? But in a stock on a smaller scale,"
"GLvTeJQE018","400280","404680"," they'll usually trend over the course of a year. You'll see"
"GLvTeJQE018","406520","412200"," stocks typically go up for a year or nine months or so. And then they'll call profits and the stock"
"GLvTeJQE018","412200","419240"," will down trend for nine months or so. And then they'll call profits. The banks will call profits"
"GLvTeJQE018","419240","424840"," that way too. And then they'll buy again, right? And the stock will go back up. You've got that"
"GLvTeJQE018","424840","432280"," up down on a larger scale. Now that's supposed to happen on the spy, right? But the spy is built"
"GLvTeJQE018","433080","438680"," to track the best performing companies in our stock market. It's built to go up. That's what it"
"GLvTeJQE018","438680","446120"," does. That's its job. It's not built to go down. If the spy starts to go down, it infers that the"
"GLvTeJQE018","446120","454040"," market is very unhealthy in general. But the best companies are unhealthy. So, spy can roll over"
"GLvTeJQE018","454040","457560"," here. It might not roll over here. But you have to trade what's in front of you."
"GLvTeJQE018","458760","465800"," So, on a grand scale, let's say you were a swing trader that trades a stock or an option"
"GLvTeJQE018","467160","472360"," for one to three months, right? You're going to be looking on this large scale here and say,"
"GLvTeJQE018","472360","479400"," well, I buy here, I buy here, I buy here, here, here, here, right? I hold a, let's say, hold an"
"GLvTeJQE018","479400","487880"," option or a spread option package for one to three months. They have tended to win"
"GLvTeJQE018","488680","496360"," for two years. And even prior to this, in horrible years, they tend to win. They don't tend to trade"
"GLvTeJQE018","496360","501000"," a lot. They're not on Twitter. They're not on YouTube. They're setting price alerts in this"
"GLvTeJQE018","501000","505960"," trend and saying when it hits this, I'm going to start to go along. And this is the scale that"
"GLvTeJQE018","505960","512280"," they use. Now, this scale is predictable. So, you're looking for certain things to happen"
"GLvTeJQE018","513080","521720"," in this trend channel. And even if you dip below here, you're providing for some space for you to"
"GLvTeJQE018","521720","525960"," make your gains back down the road. You might make them quicker, right? Well, like this, let's"
"GLvTeJQE018","525960","529720"," say you bought this and it went straight up. You could take your profit and say I'm going to wait"
"GLvTeJQE018","529720","537080"," for the next one. This happens on a smaller scale. Now, when you break through in this larger scale,"
"GLvTeJQE018","537720","544280"," let's say you break through here and you're a one to three month option holder, right? You know"
"GLvTeJQE018","544280","549320"," that this here is dangerous. You start to say to yourself, well, we're in a dangerous zone right"
"GLvTeJQE018","549320","554600"," here. How much risk can I put on before it comes back? And you should start to think about that on"
"GLvTeJQE018","554680","561160"," a smaller scale. And this with what this gives a trader is confidence, especially in this large"
"GLvTeJQE018","561160","566680"," scale. You're like, I have confidence that I can buy here, here, and here, and it's going to work."
"GLvTeJQE018","567400","572040"," Now, let's say the one time it doesn't work. Let's say it comes down and never comes back again."
"GLvTeJQE018","572040","579240"," Say we crash and it just crashes for the next five years. It still doesn't matter because you won"
"GLvTeJQE018","580120","588360"," what 20 times before then and you're only risking 10 to 30% at any time, right? And you're only"
"GLvTeJQE018","588360","593960"," taking these trades. This comes down on a smaller scale as you get lower and lower. This is a one"
"GLvTeJQE018","593960","602200"," year, right? So you get to a six month and let's say instead of playing a one to three month trade,"
"GLvTeJQE018","603160","609960"," you're playing just weeklies, right? So this isn't actually help right here, but you can start to put"
"GLvTeJQE018","609960","617560"," in moving averages, right? What's going to happen in 21 days, 10 days, five days? And what happens"
"GLvTeJQE018","617560","623880"," if we start to break through those levels? So if you see a stock or an index that is bouncing off"
"GLvTeJQE018","623880","629880"," the 10 day average, you can expect the right that it's maintaining that average. It's in a trend for"
"GLvTeJQE018","629960","635640"," 10 days. If you see that it breaks through that 10 day, you can assume that it's probably going"
"GLvTeJQE018","635640","641400"," to seek out the 20 day, 21 day, whatever moving average you're looking for at the next stage, right?"
"GLvTeJQE018","642280","646680"," And you're going to wait for that stock to touch that 21 and see if it gets a reaction."
"GLvTeJQE018","647320","652440"," Let's say it doesn't get a reaction, it falls through. Then you're going to look for the 50 day"
"GLvTeJQE018","652440","657880"," and you're going to look for the 100 day of the 150 day of the 200 day for you to look for a reaction."
"GLvTeJQE018","658520","664520"," And when you're trading using moving averages, and we're going to do some, I have some more"
"GLvTeJQE018","664520","668920"," complicated stuff for you later on, but just for a basic sense of the market and where it's at,"
"GLvTeJQE018","669640","674440"," you're looking for basic support or channels, basic support and resistance levels,"
"GLvTeJQE018","675000","681000"," previous support and resistance levels, and you're also looking for stuff to get broken through"
"GLvTeJQE018","681000","686680"," or trend higher, right? And you're also looking for expansion and contraction of the market."
"GLvTeJQE018","686760","692200"," So let's look at this right here, right? We made it an all time new high, right? Let's say we made"
"GLvTeJQE018","692200","697640"," another one and another one. We're kind of stalling out here, right? Remember how we trade sometimes"
"GLvTeJQE018","697640","703160"," and you're like, boy, this market's boring. And this market starts to roll over, right? This is"
"GLvTeJQE018","703160","709000"," a contraction in the market. And when you start to hear people say, well, we might be sideways"
"GLvTeJQE018","709000","715160"," and slightly down, right? They're talking to you about this slow rollover period."
"GLvTeJQE018","716120","723160"," See that? And as you start to roll over here, then you stop making all time new highs, right?"
"GLvTeJQE018","723800","730200"," Then you'll hear someone say, expect expansion in the coming days. When they're talking about"
"GLvTeJQE018","730200","736120"," expansion, they're saying that this is a contraction zone, right? Very small trading range. And the"
"GLvTeJQE018","736120","743560"," expansion means that we're going to drop, right? And rise. And so you'll see this"
"GLvTeJQE018","744120","749960"," trading range expanding. You'll see this high over here of 4,600. And you'll see this low down"
"GLvTeJQE018","749960","757720"," here of 4,269. The interesting part, though, is that you'll hear people talk about volume."
"GLvTeJQE018","757720","764120"," You'll actually see more volume in these selling down moments. And specifically in this basin,"
"GLvTeJQE018","764120","770280"," it'll be gnarly. And then you'll see almost like a lightning bolt of green. And it doesn't"
"GLvTeJQE018","770360","774760"," actually happen in here. It's usually somewhere over here. Sometimes if it's only one, you'll"
"GLvTeJQE018","774760","780920"," see that lightning bolt. It's over here. Now, this is neat because we're over here right now,"
"GLvTeJQE018","780920","789960"," right? And so for just a general market idea, we got killed recently. And we don't get killed"
"GLvTeJQE018","789960","795800"," like this often. So this is a positive if you're a bull. If you're a bear, you want to consider"
"GLvTeJQE018","795800","802600"," this done. This is unusual. You don't get these pullbacks that often. When they do happen,"
"GLvTeJQE018","802600","810120"," they destroy banks, hedge funds, institutions, traders, they destroy the confidence of Main Street,"
"GLvTeJQE018","810840","817960"," right? Main Street USA. So you won't see this stuff often. Every once in a while, in a grand"
"GLvTeJQE018","817960","825080"," cycle, though, you will see a top. And that's what this is right here. Not only do we not make"
"GLvTeJQE018","825560","831480"," we did make all time highs here, but the bears do not want to see you hit this 4800."
"GLvTeJQE018","832200","839400"," Because what this means if we hit this 4800 is that the bulls took charge of this defined"
"GLvTeJQE018","839400","845960"," channel we had back here. So this is a massive fight right now. Same thing up here. We hit this"
"GLvTeJQE018","846040","855320"," all time high at 4739. This caused a reaction. We had a reaction and you can blame it on"
"GLvTeJQE018","856280","861960"," the Fed chair. You can blame it on unknown rates or unknown news. And I think there is some unknown"
"GLvTeJQE018","861960","867080"," news. But when you see a reaction like this, there's a reason for it that we don't know yet."
"GLvTeJQE018","867960","872200"," So on a larger scale, you start to say to yourself, Hey, what's the expectation for 2022?"
"GLvTeJQE018","873080","879720"," And we know the expectation for 2022 is that rates will be increased. We know now that Jay"
"GLvTeJQE018","879720","883880"," Powell is probably going to get the boot at some point. So a bunch of this stuff's being priced"
"GLvTeJQE018","883880","889240"," in and was priced in back here. We have to start to think about like, is the trade over the trade"
"GLvTeJQE018","889240","896680"," is over for COVID right now, right? We know that there are shortages. We know that there's inflation."
"GLvTeJQE018","897240","902520"," Even if it's not, I do think I still am someone in the transport camp. There's some things"
"GLvTeJQE018","902520","909720"," have happened in this inflation phase that are unusual. We've never seen the pay rates go up"
"GLvTeJQE018","909720","916360"," for people. We've never seen people with this money, this much savings going into a down trend"
"GLvTeJQE018","916360","922120"," or or recession. We've never seen this much liquidity, which hasn't ended and isn't going to end"
"GLvTeJQE018","922680","929000"," for the foreseeable future. We have trillions mandated to be spent, even if we raise rates."
"GLvTeJQE018","929880","933800"," So there's always big macro things you have to consider when we start to get down to smaller"
"GLvTeJQE018","933800","939400"," scale. And you have to consider, right? We didn't make all time highs over here. And when we did"
"GLvTeJQE018","939400","947720"," make all time highs, we sold off. So you have to consider what does that mean? Are we rolling"
"GLvTeJQE018","947720","953400"," over for this two year trade right here? And eventually, we're going to eventually the clock"
"GLvTeJQE018","953400","961160"," runs out on the COVID trade heading into 2022. And there are some historical things that say,"
"GLvTeJQE018","961800","967720"," yeah, but we have the holidays. We don't want to end in a bad year. And that is, to an extent,"
"GLvTeJQE018","967720","975880"," valid. If the market is going to dump and you do it in Thanksgiving or Christmas,"
"GLvTeJQE018","976600","980840"," maybe, I guess it's possible, I guess the greed of banks that want to get out before other people"
"GLvTeJQE018","980840","988120"," is there and and damn the Main Street crowd, right? And so we're all sitting there with guns"
"GLvTeJQE018","988120","994040"," pointed at each other. But although we're all watching it to go to this screaming all time high"
"GLvTeJQE018","994040","999880"," into the new year, right? So who pulls the trigger first to make the most money to get out? And that's"
"GLvTeJQE018","999880","1006680"," starting to play itself out here. Now, let's just talk about basic support and resistance levels"
"GLvTeJQE018","1007320","1013800"," if we want to continue higher. On this macro level right here, right? We did we made all time"
"GLvTeJQE018","1013800","1018120"," highs here. We made them back here too, right? Made all time highs, pulled back, pushed up,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1018120","1023960"," all time highs, pulled back, pushed up, right? All time highs. Notice that we didn't have any"
"GLvTeJQE018","1023960","1032280"," sideways trading. We literally made a higher low and then a higher high, higher low, higher high,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1033400","1039240"," higher low, higher high, higher low, higher high. So you're looking for those things, right?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1039240","1046600"," Higher lows, higher highs. Those are telltale signs that we're not done going up. Now,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1046600","1055240"," what triggers these sell-offs? Well, we traded up for how many days? This is the 13th and this is"
"GLvTeJQE018","1055240","1061000"," the 8th of November. So it starts to get risky here. We talked about this in previous videos."
"GLvTeJQE018","1061560","1066200"," We should see some slight pullback and come up. We didn't. We kept pushing. When you start seeing"
"GLvTeJQE018","1066200","1072040"," moves like this, there's going to be a blow up and we're blowing off again down here. So you need"
"GLvTeJQE018","1072040","1077640"," to consider this stuff. You start to wonder like, hey, should I take a long hair, Captain Jim?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1078760","1087560"," The risk of you taking a long right now is way more risky than allowing this action here to play"
"GLvTeJQE018","1087560","1095560"," out or to play the short side in this area. We'll get into the details here of how dangerous we are."
"GLvTeJQE018","1095560","1101080"," This is where we are right now is. But what I spoke to you earlier about was higher highs,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1101080","1105640"," higher lows, higher highs, higher lows. Those things make a bull happy. They piss off a bear."
"GLvTeJQE018","1106440","1113320"," You know what pisses off or makes a bear happy and pisses off a bull is when you get lower highs"
"GLvTeJQE018","1113320","1120360"," and lower lows. And if you're trading one to three months out, you're looking for those things on a"
"GLvTeJQE018","1120360","1125160"," grinder scale. When you're trading month to month, you're looking for those things on a smaller scale."
"GLvTeJQE018","1125160","1132200"," Same thing goes for weekly or daily. And we all know that you can go right back and find it."
"GLvTeJQE018","1132200","1136520"," I told you when to sell, I think I sold you to sell here, here, or somewhere back here. And I was"
"GLvTeJQE018","1136520","1142760"," like, exit all this shit that you have, go cash, and we'll play this market as it happens in the"
"GLvTeJQE018","1142760","1147080"," year. And the reason that you're doing that is because what I told you, at some point, they're"
"GLvTeJQE018","1147080","1152360"," going to fucking rug pull it off of you. At some point, I said one, I have to find these videos."
"GLvTeJQE018","1152360","1157320"," They said, you're going to call Apple now, you're going to see Apple go way higher,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1158200","1163720"," right? And you're going to get trapped and not be able to sell that top. And I know for some of"
"GLvTeJQE018","1163720","1170280"," you that did happen this past week. So where we are, where I am as a trader, I take longs on,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1170280","1178040"," I take stock, I invest in stock, I focus on let's say Tesla, and I know when it's going up,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1178040","1182920"," but I know when it's going down over the course of a year, five years, and three months and one"
"GLvTeJQE018","1182920","1188840"," month, a general idea of where it's going. So right now we're trading this market by the day,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1188840","1196360"," by the week, by the month, it's very short options mostly. Maybe we play some stocks that don't have"
"GLvTeJQE018","1196360","1202040"," a lot of liquidity in their options or they're cheap to buy, right? Or we're selling puts or"
"GLvTeJQE018","1202040","1207960"," selling calls. If I own the underlying and I don't care for 20 years, and I buy every real"
"GLvTeJQE018","1208120","1212760"," dip, you know, that's another whole conversation. People say that they buy stock and they don't"
"GLvTeJQE018","1212760","1217640"," care there. I'm in Tesla, I don't care, but they buy tops the whole way. If you bought Apple past"
"GLvTeJQE018","1217640","1223800"," two years or past past year, year and a half, you could have bought every top and you're flat right"
"GLvTeJQE018","1223800","1231640"," now. You've gained nothing. Zero. So if you're just an investor, there's the time to buy and"
"GLvTeJQE018","1231640","1236680"," there's the time not to buy. So looking at a 2022, you're going to be looking for a few things,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1237240","1242280"," you're looking for, people are going to tell you, like I told you, that tech's not going to go big"
"GLvTeJQE018","1242280","1248600"," in 2022. It probably still will, but that means it has to sell off, take profit for it to go big,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1248600","1257480"," even if it's sideways for 2022, right? The real trades are going to be in financials because of"
"GLvTeJQE018","1258520","1265880"," rates. They are going to be in oil because of inflation and because of the tightening of oil."
"GLvTeJQE018","1265960","1270520"," You're going to find those to be the best trades. You're going to find real goods to be the best"
"GLvTeJQE018","1270520","1275240"," trades. They won't be the glamorous ones. You can keep playing Apple and Tesla in 2022."
"GLvTeJQE018","1275240","1279800"," You just have to realize that they're going to pull profit from Tesla. You know, the trade in Tesla"
"GLvTeJQE018","1279800","1287320"," was in May. I think the stock was trading at $550 or $650. All those real banks that bought that"
"GLvTeJQE018","1287880","1294360"," want out of $1,200, $1,300, they're going to take their profit. That's going to pull"
"GLvTeJQE018","1294360","1300040"," the stock back and they're going to pull and you're going to have bag holders in there. They're going"
"GLvTeJQE018","1300040","1307480"," to be squeezed until they give up, they call uncle and they sell and drop the price even more."
"GLvTeJQE018","1307480","1312840"," I'll do a video on this one day. I can explain it in a much simpler way. But anyways, the point"
"GLvTeJQE018","1313720","1318360"," is this is that we're at the end of the year. We're looking towards 2022, right? We might have a"
"GLvTeJQE018","1318360","1324200"," Christmas rally or a holiday rally. But for where we are right now, we're going to go on a smaller"
"GLvTeJQE018","1324200","1335240"," scale. Okay, this is a one month outlook. If you're a bull, the longer we go sideways,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1335240","1341960"," the more chance that we're going up, that's just a fact. We had a new high here and we had a new"
"GLvTeJQE018","1341960","1345880"," high here, okay? This is something that the bears did not want to see over here."
"GLvTeJQE018","1347400","1352280"," But on a smaller time scale, let's say this is how I'm trading right now, right? I'm looking"
"GLvTeJQE018","1352280","1359400"," at a weekly. So I already know in my yearly that we're going to roll over in 2022, the COVID trade"
"GLvTeJQE018","1359400","1366280"," is over and that the inflation trade is on, the even transitory inflation trade is on."
"GLvTeJQE018","1366280","1370600"," I know that the shortage trade is on. People are going to buy those things, right? I also know"
"GLvTeJQE018","1370600","1376200"," that tech has has ripened up or a lot of tech has ripened up. We can already see it in stocks"
"GLvTeJQE018","1376200","1381880"," like pins, we can already see it and snap and things like that, right? So right now I'm going to"
"GLvTeJQE018","1381880","1387800"," risk off situation as a retail trader. So I'm looking on a monthly and I'm looking on a weekly"
"GLvTeJQE018","1387800","1394520"," and on a daily for where we are in the market, right? So I'm going to start to look for certain"
"GLvTeJQE018","1394520","1399080"," things that happened, right? We were coming up here. This was this, this was just this past week."
"GLvTeJQE018","1399160","1405480"," This is the 19th. Look at this calendar down here. Today is the 22nd. Let's look at the 15th to the"
"GLvTeJQE018","1405480","1415160"," 19th over here, okay? This is a gorgeous week, by the way, right? We pushed up. We found support,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1415960","1421720"," right? We took that support. You can start to define last week where our support was and you're"
"GLvTeJQE018","1421720","1430840"," saying, okay, for this week, I know that we're going this way, right? See at the 15th, 16th,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1430840","1436040"," you know, you could have bought this on the 17th. On the 18th, we got trapped or we got scared,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1436040","1440120"," but it's still bounced right back, right? Right into the close, into the 19th."
"GLvTeJQE018","1441960","1448760"," We sold off, right? And all of a sudden we found more support over here. And so you think to yourself,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1448760","1455400"," hey, look, I knew last week the week prior that this was support. So I say to myself,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1455400","1462280"," until that breaks, I'm going to take this long. And so we did, we took along, right? And all of a"
"GLvTeJQE018","1462280","1469160"," sudden, we sold off and you just have to say to yourself, whoa, shit, we did not make a higher"
"GLvTeJQE018","1469160","1474600"," high here. So you start to get scared and you're like, okay, I'm going to make this line over here."
"GLvTeJQE018","1474600","1481160"," I already know that this is going on in my new week over here, right? And when I'm in this new"
"GLvTeJQE018","1481160","1488040"," week, there's two things I need to know. We can't break this support. And when we start to contract"
"GLvTeJQE018","1488040","1494920"," our trading and we haven't broken support, there's a fair chance that we are going to squeeze higher"
"GLvTeJQE018","1494920","1501640"," until we get to the next point that is rejected. So as we start, as we start squeezing down here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1501640","1507480"," I'm looking back on last week, I'm also thinking about quarterlies. I'm thinking about monthly"
"GLvTeJQE018","1507480","1511880"," OPEX, thinking about where they want this market to be. I'm saying, where is it going to go?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1512520","1518600"," Chances are, we've been working towards some ultimate number up here, right? And we'll get into"
"GLvTeJQE018","1518600","1523880"," how to figure out what these new all-time high tops are on a larger scale when this bigger trading"
"GLvTeJQE018","1523880","1530520"," channel, how far do we have to go before OPEX? How about quarterly OPEXes? So you can start to do"
"GLvTeJQE018","1531160","1537000"," some actual math to measure how high the next top will be. And when we got up here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1538440","1542680"," and this was on the 22nd, this was on Monday. Remember this happened?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1544200","1550120"," Right? This should have been and should have not been a surprise. We shouldn't have gone this"
"GLvTeJQE018","1550120","1556840"," high this quickly. And when we did, this is an opportunity and a point in this whole movement"
"GLvTeJQE018","1556840","1562440"," where people or big banks wanted to take profit. So they did. They took profit. And where did we"
"GLvTeJQE018","1562440","1569640"," bounce? We bounced where the rest of these people wanted this market minimum. And we shot back up."
"GLvTeJQE018","1569640","1576600"," And when they shot back up, more banks took profit and sold down into this move down below here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1576600","1584280"," okay? This was the open, I believe, that came into play on, I think this is Tuesday, it was."
"GLvTeJQE018","1584280","1589480"," And you start to see this second resistance level there. So you start to see these things."
"GLvTeJQE018","1590040","1595560"," This is on a weekly or a monthly basis. You start to see we've got some heavy resistance going on."
"GLvTeJQE018","1596280","1603320"," So we're going to put these in here. We don't want to see these break, right? You see this here?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1603880","1609240"," You don't want to see these, or it's not really, it's called this resistance, but you don't want"
"GLvTeJQE018","1609240","1614120"," to see these support levels break, right? These are the resistance levels, sorry, rambling here."
"GLvTeJQE018","1614680","1621560"," But you don't want to see these support levels break. When you see these things break, it's bad."
"GLvTeJQE018","1621560","1628760"," And what we saw already was we saw one break of that support level. We'll scroll out here a little"
"GLvTeJQE018","1628760","1634840"," bit. Okay, we're going to go out a little bit more. And you start to see where did we bounce?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1634840","1640520"," We bounced on our channel. So if we're going to start to sell off, you already know that they're"
"GLvTeJQE018","1640520","1645960"," going to, the bears are going to attempt to test this, right? So we're getting close down here again."
"GLvTeJQE018","1646760","1648840"," We know that we tested it."
"GLvTeJQE018","1654920","1655560"," Come here."
"GLvTeJQE018","1656440","1664600"," We tested this support down here once we came up. And if we're going to be bearish,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1666360","1675960"," what do we want to see? We want to see lower highs, right? And we want to see lower lows, right?"
"GLvTeJQE018","1675960","1683880"," Which is what we got today. We got a lower high. We got a lower low. This is not healthy for us going"
"GLvTeJQE018","1683880","1690760"," up. And when we closed the day here, we got another lower high. And so when I was on Twitter"
"GLvTeJQE018","1690760","1696040"," today, I was talking to you guys and I was like, this does not bode well for the market. You don't"
"GLvTeJQE018","1696040","1702840"," want to see these lower highs and lower lows. This right here becomes a contraction. You'll start"
"GLvTeJQE018","1702840","1711240"," to see this contraction and another attempt to move down. I think that this lines up to"
"GLvTeJQE018","1712040","1720520"," tomorrow's economic news and the FOMC. You're going to see this dump down into the open tomorrow."
"GLvTeJQE018","1720520","1729080"," You'll see us ride this trend line waiting on bad news to dump it and then to wait for the FOMC"
"GLvTeJQE018","1729080","1736600"," meeting for them to announce one important thing. We're we're going to start rates right now or"
"GLvTeJQE018","1736600","1741160"," we're going to start rates in January. We're going to start rates in March. So you're looking"
"GLvTeJQE018","1741160","1749640"," for only one or two things either rates or no rates. That's really what you're looking for."
"GLvTeJQE018","1749640","1755960"," You'll see some volatility down here, some attempts to drop it. And you'll also be wondering about"
"GLvTeJQE018","1755960","1763160"," if the news is known by big banks before it gets dropped. And one key thing tomorrow you're going"
"GLvTeJQE018","1763160","1769400"," to be looking for is when the shit news comes out between 8 and 10 a.m. If a bank knows rates are"
"GLvTeJQE018","1769480","1775640"," going to be dropped in the news later in the day, you will see a drop before we get there"
"GLvTeJQE018","1775640","1783160"," or we get really weak. If you start to see us contract even more as we lead up into 2 p.m."
"GLvTeJQE018","1783160","1789560"," it becomes more likely that we're actually going to go up. In the last FOMC meeting,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1789560","1796040"," we did that. The last FOMC meeting was on Twitter and I said I'm get buying some hedge calls here."
"GLvTeJQE018","1796120","1801880"," It was absurd that to the last half an hour we hadn't dropped. And to me that meant that"
"GLvTeJQE018","1801880","1809320"," someone knew we were going up. Everybody, the entire market was short or inputs. The price of a call"
"GLvTeJQE018","1809320","1816840"," was pennies. I can't remember what we made but it was stupid. It was like 3 to 5,000%."
"GLvTeJQE018","1817960","1823160"," So we're going to be looking for this into tomorrow. We have our big picture in tomorrow"
"GLvTeJQE018","1823720","1829400"," and you're going to be looking for some form of this major channel that we know"
"GLvTeJQE018","1830040","1837320"," being respected until someone knows more than we do. And if they know that we're going down,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1837960","1843320"," they're going to dump this market before we ever get to FOMC. And if they know that we're not going"
"GLvTeJQE018","1843320","1847160"," down, they're going to make a couple of attempts. They're going to scare tactic you. They're going"
"GLvTeJQE018","1847160","1853720"," to post news on Twitter, Wall Street Bets, any fucking thing you watch, CNBC, you're going to see"
"GLvTeJQE018","1854600","1861720"," a fucking Kabuki theater. That don't mean shit. The only thing that means anything is where this"
"GLvTeJQE018","1861720","1868360"," fucking thing goes tomorrow. If you see this line get respected leading into FOMC, it's time to go"
"GLvTeJQE018","1868360","1874360"," along. And this is really scary for bears even though we're doing these lower-sized time in the"
"GLvTeJQE018","1875160","1880520"," bears. No, we're going to be looking for is the lower highs, lower lows, lower"
"GLvTeJQE018","1880520","1887160"," and look back on that to see what we're looking to do. And we don't see any lower lows back here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1887160","1891960"," right? I don't see a lower low back here, even though we're going forward. So I'm going to start"
"GLvTeJQE018","1891960","1897560"," to look backwards to the last one. Okay, I'm going to bring this back out to a three month."
"GLvTeJQE018","1898520","1906040"," I don't see any lower lows here. So if we start to sell off, I'm going to start to look for"
"GLvTeJQE018","1906680","1916520"," a new lower low. I'm going to put one in. Okay, I'm going to find the last lower low. And surprisingly,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1918040","1920360"," it's right there. And there's another one"
"GLvTeJQE018","1920360","1930440"," right in here. Now I have to check the days in here, 11th, 10th. So the 11th, this is the 10th,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1931000","1938360"," right? Where's the last one, right? We had a low, we had a low, that's not a low, right? It's a"
"GLvTeJQE018","1938360","1942360"," higher low. So we're going to get rid of this one. We're going to move it, right? We had a low."
"GLvTeJQE018","1943640","1948360"," And this was a lower low in the previous, so we know we're going to tag this one. Whereas the next"
"GLvTeJQE018","1948360","1953640"," lower low, as we moved up, right? We're higher, right? This was lower before."
"GLvTeJQE018","1954840","1964360"," So we're going to go right here. And that's our next one right there. So we got 4627,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1964360","1972760"," we have 4544.25. We know on a weekly and on a daily that we are in a bearish territory still."
"GLvTeJQE018","1972760","1979800"," We know that our last lower lows were 4627 and 4544. So we're going to get closer on this chart."
"GLvTeJQE018","1980840","1987880"," Once again. And so what are we looking for tomorrow? We're looking for resistance here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1987880","1993000"," moving into FMC. If we break this, I'm going to tell you right now, this is where we're going,"
"GLvTeJQE018","1993000","1999640"," right here. If the news is excellent and we still break this, we'll look for some kind of a grab"
"GLvTeJQE018","1999640","2006040"," down below like we did the day before in this vicinity here. So we can do as we can put a line here"
"GLvTeJQE018","2008920","2016760"," right here, make this positive. So let's change the style to a dash line, right? If positive news,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2016760","2022840"," we could break this low to go higher. We know that buyers are waiting here for a decision or to go"
"GLvTeJQE018","2022840","2028520"," higher, right? So remember this, these lines here for tomorrow. The next thing would be this,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2028600","2034280"," let's say we have positive news, let's say all the economic news, tomorrow's kickass and awesome."
"GLvTeJQE018","2034280","2038600"," Let's say someone knows in the inside that we're not raising rates, all that kind of stuff."
"GLvTeJQE018","2039560","2043800"," And we bounce. What are we looking to? What are we looking to break through?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2045240","2047400"," All right, we're going to start to look at previous days."
"GLvTeJQE018","2049640","2054280"," Where was big resistance? We know we have resistance"
"GLvTeJQE018","2055160","2059480"," above here, right? We know that, but wait a minute."
"GLvTeJQE018","2063400","2066120"," We know we have another one. We have to change all these."
"GLvTeJQE018","2071320","2075880"," We know we have another one somewhere in here, right around here. You can start to see us."
"GLvTeJQE018","2076760","2081480"," We have another resistance somewhere in here. We know we have another one over here."
"GLvTeJQE018","2081480","2084600"," And these are minor. You could change the size of these because"
"GLvTeJQE018","2086920","2092520"," because we know if there's good news, these are going to be speed bumps on the way up."
"GLvTeJQE018","2094280","2104600"," Now we also know that right here we sold out. This one right here is where all the big banks are."
"GLvTeJQE018","2105320","2110840"," If these guys aren't long, they are going to be pissed. If they're trapped from down below,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2111640","2119160"," this one right here, if we have positive news, these are all squeeze points. But if we get up here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2121400","2126680"," this is it. We could squeeze way, way higher. So what are you going to do as a bull or a bear,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2127240","2132360"," right? You could play this down to this support. You get out and wait for confirmation to go lower."
"GLvTeJQE018","2132360","2138200"," If you're a bull, you're going to wait for this line here to be tested for the third"
"GLvTeJQE018","2138280","2142760"," or fourth time, maybe even the fifth. And the more you see it tested, it doesn't break."
"GLvTeJQE018","2142760","2151080"," The more conviction you're going to have to take long into OPEX. Now when we take this long here,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2151080","2155960"," and all of a sudden everybody's bullish, your sites aren't set on these two numbers anymore."
"GLvTeJQE018","2155960","2161560"," This is where your site is on. Okay, that's 4740. And we're going to extend past that. You're"
"GLvTeJQE018","2161560","2166120"," actually going to do a measured move. I'll show you this later. We'll be a measure from here to here."
"GLvTeJQE018","2166920","2171640"," And you're going to come back here. And it's going to give you 0.68% or whatever,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2172280","2176040"," how much higher we're going to go. That's for another video. But this is what you need to know"
"GLvTeJQE018","2176040","2182600"," for tomorrow. When I told you to close, I meant it. When I told you that MM's want to steal money,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2182600","2186680"," I meant it. When I told you that they're going to steal that you think bull is going to make"
"GLvTeJQE018","2186680","2192360"," money tomorrow out open, you're smoking crack. They're going to bury this thing sideways."
"GLvTeJQE018","2192360","2197400"," There's going to be a decision. And we're going to go way up or way lower. And we know now what"
"GLvTeJQE018","2197400","2202600"," we're looking for. If it's bullish news and we dip below, and let's say it's bullish news and we"
"GLvTeJQE018","2202600","2207400"," don't dip below, you're still going to wait for this push up and you're going to jump and draw"
"GLvTeJQE018","2207400","2211480"," this out for you. You're going to draw. Let's say, let's say tomorrow we come down here and we do"
"GLvTeJQE018","2211480","2216120"," this bullshit, right? We wave, weaver, weaver, weaver. And all of a sudden we shoot up and you go,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2216440","2225640"," shit, I missed it. It could still dump. So what you're looking for is if you're a bull, let's say,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2226440","2234200"," you're looking for BAM, right? We go sideways. And all of a sudden we shoot up and you missed it."
"GLvTeJQE018","2234200","2240600"," You're still waiting for us to come above and rest, right? If everybody gets their wits about them"
"GLvTeJQE018","2240600","2244040"," and then make these moves up higher and higher. If you're a bear,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2246440","2251400"," get rid of that, right? Or let's say you're a bull, or a bear. And let's say we ride,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2251960","2256440"," let's say we ride this line tomorrow. And then all of a sudden we start to break down below,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2257240","2264600"," right? If you're a bear, I wouldn't take this unless it was FOMC. This is FOMC, right? And they're"
"GLvTeJQE018","2264600","2268920"," breaking below. I'd be waiting for this line right here because this is the demand line."
"GLvTeJQE018","2268920","2273880"," Supply line. People want this. They might be dumping this to this point, right? All of a sudden"
"GLvTeJQE018","2273880","2280920"," you get positive news and we're off and running. So if you're a bear, you want to be waiting for"
"GLvTeJQE018","2280920","2287480"," either news confirmation, right, of going like this. Bad news would go down. Or you want to be"
"GLvTeJQE018","2287480","2295400"," waiting for the FOMC. Let's say we get the FOMC. It has bad news. It automatically starts to dump"
"GLvTeJQE018","2295400","2299880"," and you missed it. You're going to wait for that one little blip and then grab it down. If you're"
"GLvTeJQE018","2299880","2304360"," a bull, you're going to do the same thing. Let's say you miss all this. And it was horrible news."
"GLvTeJQE018","2304920","2309880"," You're going to wait for this, right? This bounce, it's going to come up. We see this all the time,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2309880","2317240"," right? And it starts to do this. And then it sells off. So these are the things that you need to start"
"GLvTeJQE018","2317240","2324440"," to on your own figure out as to where we are. So that you have some confidence into what we're doing."
"GLvTeJQE018","2324440","2331080"," Now let's get into the start of tomorrow. So seeing and knowing all this stuff, what would"
"GLvTeJQE018","2331080","2337240"," my expectation be on the open tomorrow? We're going to go sideways. That's what I think."
"GLvTeJQE018","2337960","2343480"," And I'll call that to you. We're going sideways tomorrow. No matter what you tell me, that's what"
"GLvTeJQE018","2343480","2348760"," we're doing. We're going to probably go sideways right up on this line right here until we get the"
"GLvTeJQE018","2348760","2354200"," news. We might have some weakness, come back, and then we're going to wait for the FOMC and with"
"GLvTeJQE018","2354200","2360920"," decision is on rates or someone knows, right? That's my call for tomorrow. Now could we go"
"GLvTeJQE018","2360920","2367240"," fucking up 90 fucking handles tomorrow at the open? Sure. Can we drop fucking 300 handles"
"GLvTeJQE018","2367240","2373000"," the open? Sure. Can I get this wrong? Sure. But I know that I'm informed"
"GLvTeJQE018","2374360","2380520"," to make an informed decision and not straight panic. Now let's say we're in this situation right now."
"GLvTeJQE018","2381480","2387640"," Oftentimes when we open at 9.30, they will be a fake up, not all the time. And there are other"
"GLvTeJQE018","2387640","2393720"," factors that come in. What day is it? Is it a weekly opex? Is it a monthly opex? Is it a Thursday"
"GLvTeJQE018","2393720","2398840"," before a monthly opex? Is it quarterly? Is it rebalancing? Is it quad, triple-witching?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2399640","2403800"," All this other shit. But for you right now, you just want to have a basic understanding."
"GLvTeJQE018","2404600","2406840"," And when you don't understand something around here"
"GLvTeJQE018","2407800","2413880"," in a week or in a day and you see certain keywords coming up like, hey, are we rebalancing? Hey,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2413880","2418920"," is this a quad-witching? Ask people. Say, what does this have to do with where I'm at in the market?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2418920","2423160"," Because if you only know these basic things, but you don't know what a quad-witching is,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2423160","2427480"," you can ask. You can ask, hey man, we've been trending down for this whole month opex. Do you"
"GLvTeJQE018","2427480","2432600"," know more than I do? What does this mean for the Thursday of monthly opex? So you have to"
"GLvTeJQE018","2432600","2436680"," reach out and ask people for those other clues. Hey man, am I missing something in the news?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2437000","2440680"," Hey man, am I missing something in where we're going into the end of the year?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2440680","2446520"," And you start to piece together for yourself and you can start to put blinders on for the news."
"GLvTeJQE018","2446520","2450840"," You can start to think to yourself, how much do we actually fucking need to know"
"GLvTeJQE018","2450840","2454520"," about the F-forms F-forms C? How much do I fucking really need to know"
"GLvTeJQE018","2455240","2460600"," about the numbers that are coming out in the economic calendar? A lot of this action back here"
"GLvTeJQE018","2460600","2467800"," tells you, it definitely tells you where you should be depending upon what happens regardless"
"GLvTeJQE018","2467800","2474360"," of what the news is. I hope this helps you tomorrow. And if you feel like you're lost,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2475640","2481320"," start to watch a video like this repetitively and try to make your own support and resistance"
"GLvTeJQE018","2481320","2488600"," lines on a chart specifically an index. I'll get into the charts are slightly different for stocks,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2488600","2495880"," but this one right here S&P 500 trades a certain way. IWM trades a certain channel."
"GLvTeJQE018","2496760","2501080"," NASDAQ trades a certain channel. If you find one of those, you start with one of those"
"GLvTeJQE018","2501080","2505880"," and you add all three into your quiver so you can bounce between them and then you add one stock"
"GLvTeJQE018","2505880","2510200"," and know it, then more stock or another stock and know it, then you can always go back to those."
"GLvTeJQE018","2510200","2516440"," One stock's going up or going down from a different industry, right? You can start to understand"
"GLvTeJQE018","2517000","2522760"," or be able to jump between what you're doing. So when you guys come into your openings every day,"
"GLvTeJQE018","2522760","2528600"," you should have on your plate a firm idea of what the fuck is going to happen. And I'll tell you"
"GLvTeJQE018","2528600","2534680"," what, if you have information like this, we might burn tomorrow at open, we might go to the moon"
"GLvTeJQE018","2534680","2542600"," tomorrow at open, but 60 to 70 to 80 percent of the time guarantee you that you will have the"
"GLvTeJQE018","2542680","2548040"," understanding or the knowledge of where we're actually going nine times, like seven times out"
"GLvTeJQE018","2548040","2552440"," of 10, the market's going to move the way you want it to move, okay? At least the general"
"GLvTeJQE018","2552440","2557240"," direction. You know where your support lines are, you know where you want to buy, right? You can"
"GLvTeJQE018","2557240","2563240"," start to figure out way back months, weeks, months, and years, and especially the longer you trade"
"GLvTeJQE018","2563240","2567480"," and know this stuff, the more you're going to be in tune with, hey, where are we in the market?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2567480","2571640"," What's the probability of us going up and down today, the week, the month, and the year?"
"GLvTeJQE018","2572680","2578120"," Hope this helps. If you're really last right now, I apologize. I probably owe you guys some like"
"GLvTeJQE018","2578120","2588520"," basic fucking trading videos. Good night. Good luck tomorrow. And again, happy Thanksgiving."
