"12810","14990"," Am I actually live right now or no?"
"17850","23170"," The Illuminati said it down."
"26110","35890"," So I just checked my processes in the background and it showed"
"35890","38790"," Microsoft Edge trying to do an update."
"46700","49140"," Why does this one say I'm live right now?"
"49700","54580"," Fuck is going on with some problems with YouTube right now. "
"54980","55640"," Hang tight here."
"90160","91220"," Let's try that again."
"94420","95320"," And I'm getting. "
"104490","106710"," So how is, let me ask you a question."
"106710","108270"," If you're a supporter."
"109290","110910"," If you are a supporter. "
"112370","113450"," Or higher."
"114330","116410"," How's this morning's chart."
"117630","121610"," Looking versus the chart that I posted for you last night. "
"123210","124410"," Pretty good right."
"125510","126570"," That's pretty good right."
"135020","136700"," I'd say it's pretty good right. "
"146080","147160"," Somebody want to."
"147560","148680"," Let me check the discord."
"153800","155120"," And back up again. "
"189370","190950"," Sorry about the delay."
"191710","204000"," I don't know"
"204000","207340"," what more you could ask for."
"207340","210300"," I don't know what more even if it goes against us. "
"210300","211520"," What more can you ask for."
"229870","232510"," So now no it's so big to avoid on stream."
"236770","237730"," I'm Drake. "
"238570","239670"," That wouldn't shock me man."
"240170","242090"," I really wouldn't."
"242090","243710"," Yeah, it's a good. "
"243830","244530"," Good point."
"244710","244970"," Andre."
"249910","253250"," Nice little back test trade right there on the hourly trigger. "
"253310","254970"," Looking for some more upside here."
"256170","259230"," Targeting next up side move targeting 513 12."
"260490","261550"," 513 50. "
"268290","270150"," I will be honest here."
"270150","273370"," There is probably some of that isn't there."
"274430","275770"," Probably is some of that. "
"276610","278350"," That shit wouldn't surprise me."
"280270","280850"," It's Andre."
"281310","281530"," Sorry brother. "
"282690","283630"," Thanks for the correction."
"284230","286070"," Every time I say and drag, I feel like it's Andre."
"286390","286650"," Shut up. "
"287150","288050"," Am I pronouncing that right?"
"288230","288570"," I don't know."
"288850","291290"," Let me know if I'm pronouncing that mispronouncing that."
"292190","293510"," No, it's Andre. "
"294730","295170"," Sorry."
"312910","313910"," It's perfectly OK."
"315510","316390"," All right. "
"316690","317870"," So give me."
"318350","319950"," Let me take a quick break here."
"320470","323690"," Give me like just five minutes to want to stand up. "
"324030","325190"," I'm going to get a cup of water."
"325350","327010"," I've got some coffee in front of me."
"327210","328390"," I need some water. "
"328990","330750"," So I just need like a five minute break."
"331750","333030"," I'm going to put on."
"333030","334770"," So down below, you've got NVDA. "
"337070","344850"," Did any of you get the update from last night on NVDA expect an upside move here in NVDA?"
"345790","348230"," And then a big roll down."
"349070","353010"," Some kind of big move like this and then an actual bigger move down."
"354290","355350"," So leave that there. "
"355550","356630"," I think that's what I expect, right?"
"356830","357510"," Things are great here."
"358290","360530"," A note on NVDA."
"360950","363550"," I should have told you this last night, but I didn't. "
"365790","369510"," NVDA is in a downward move right now."
"372270","374530"," But it is looking for a dip to buy."
"375230","380130"," So you are a buyer of dips on NVDA right now, but not yet. "
"381370","382150"," In my view."
"384150","387430"," But I think there is a buyable dip on NVDA."
"387650","388610"," I just don't think this is the one. "
"388850","393990"," So I'm still in the thought process that we're going down here on NVDA."
"394130","395130"," So just be aware of that."
"395890","397410"," If you're looking for the buy. "
"399570","400770"," You're going to get a coffee?"
"400990","401170"," Okay."
"401650","401990"," All right, right."
"402170","403010"," I'm going to do the same thing. "
"404270","405730"," I'll be right back with you guys in a few minutes."
"405770","407870"," I'm going to put on some CNBC in the background."
"408250","409470"," I'll be back in just a moment. "
"411310","412810"," I thought I had."
"414070","415570"," I had to lead some of this crap."
"419050","419770"," All right. "
"419990","420570"," Hold on here."
"425010","430030"," I'm going to put on a diarrhea TV for a few minutes."
"430490","434530"," I think you want to tag team on a reverse repo facility chart for tomorrow?"
"434770","435870"," Let's just think too. "
"436030","437090"," I want to say something here."
"437950","441490"," All that fucking doom and gloom between yesterday and today."
"442170","443010"," The market's still going. "
"443210","444150"," We're supposed to go, isn't it?"
"445450","446370"," Yeah, that's right."
"446550","447630"," But just a few blocks from here."
"448230","449230"," That's why we have you here. "
"449410","449450"," Hi."
"449790","450930"," Turning to the energy sector."
"451470","455790"," While tech has grabbed all the attention, the energy sector is actually the top performing sector"
"455790","456610"," in the past month. "
"457090","460930"," For more on the state of the energy market, the key themes we are seeing and what we're learning."
"461410","464950"," Let's bring in our Brian Sullivan live from the annual Sarah Week Conference in Houston."
"464950","468910"," He's been talking to energy CEOs for the past 24 hours. "
"468910","471790"," Brian, what have we learned about the sustainability of this rally?"
"473010","478510"," I think Sarah, you and Mike may have talked about AI or Nvidia a little bit today."
"478790","480690"," Just wild speculation on my part."
"481030","483950"," And actually, that's a huge theme here as well. "
"484330","488890"," Because artificial intelligence and the data centers needed to drive all that computing growth."
"489190","491510"," Jensen Wong of Nvidia was talking about just this."
"491510","496150"," That energy, that electricity has got to come from somewhere. "
"496350","502210"," And there's kind of this come to AI Jesus moment here at Sarah Week where suddenly everybody's"
"502210","506950"," realizing, oh my gosh, the estimates for power demand growth are so high."
"507430","510390"," We don't need to do this or that or that."
"511030","513929"," We need to do everything kind of this all in theme. "
"514610","518690"," And one other theme of this conference, Sarah, is that there's a lot of investors here."
"518690","521549"," I've been coming to this for more than, I don't know, 12, 15 years."
"522330","525630"," And this year has the most investors of any year. "
"526150","527450"," I've seen Carl Iles here."
"527970","528750"," Guggenheim is here."
"528910","534470"," And in fact, last night we sat down with Alan Schwartz, who is Executive Chairman of Guggenheim. "
"535010","543030"," And he talked about the mass amounts of money that are likely going to be made from energy and"
"543030","543370"," renewables."
"543870","543930"," Listen."
"546640","551400"," I've talked about how I've been leading a big focus from Guggenheim on sustainability. "
"552560","556740"," And we think it's going to be the biggest wave of capital expending in the history of the world."
"557160","561320"," The biggest wave of capital spending in the history of the world."
"561480","563300"," I mean, if that's not a headline, Sarah, I don't know what is. "
"563680","568080"," Okay, and by the way, another theme here is rising cost for electricity."
"569000","573860"," As we build out renewables, as we come back climate change, we're kind of doing double duty, right?"
"573860","575640"," Because you got to build wind, you got to build solar."
"576480","580440"," But you got to make sure that you also, the lights and the heater on, even if the sun is"
"580440","581880"," not shining and the wind is not blowing. "
"582500","587100"," And earlier this morning, we chatted with one of Canada's biggest pipeline operators, have huge U "
"587100","588060",".S. operations as well."
"588180","591020"," It's a company called Enbridge, who's building out the renewables business."
"591520","593040"," And I asked the CEO a very basic question. "
"594120","596460"," Why are natural gas prices going down?"
"597060","601280"," But all of our viewer and listeners' electricity prices going up."
"601440","602100"," Here's what he had to say."
"602960","606660"," So in some respects, we're asking consumers to pay twice. "
"607480","611880"," And I don't think policymakers and politicians have been forthright on that front."
"612340","615500"," Consumers are smart though, and they're saying, no, Maas, we've had enough of that."
"615920","622840"," Let us kind of do a transition that makes sense, realistically, economically, sustainably, and from"
"622840","623700"," a security perspective. "
"624040","624880"," So I think that's the issue."
"626120","631060"," So you're building two things, Sarah and Mike, effectively on top of each other right now, and"
"631060","633160"," that's why electricity costs continue to rise."
"633500","635720"," Enis the price of natural gas continues to go down. "
"636260","637180"," We've got a big lineup here."
"637320","638420"," We've got conical Phillips tonight."
"638720","639820"," We've got Chevron live tonight. "
"640040","642020"," We've got Dan Jurgen live tonight."
"642440","643940"," Probably some surprises thrown in there."
"644200","645640"," It's been interesting. "
"645960","646360"," A lot of money."
"646840","648240"," Trillions of dollars floating around here."
"648320","648700"," It's here a week. "
"649460","649620"," Yeah."
"650260","654860"," Well, we'll need it for the largest infrastructure expenditures in the history of the world."
"654860","656840"," Brian, appreciate it. "
"656940","657800"," We will follow right along."
"658200","659980"," Just a note here really quick."
"660520","667400"," Before I take my break here, we're going to scroll down to some stuff I want you to pay a"
"667400","668740"," close attention to. "
"672140","679300"," So just for your gamma for the day here, leaving a little bit of a gap down below here, right?"
"679460","680040"," You can see that."
"681160","683460"," Your local resistance."
"683840","685400"," This isn't called wall actually. "
"686440","689700"," We'll just make this, at least we can change this bit for you."
"693190","694750"," We have local resistance."
"702720","704560"," Local support, local resistance. "
"706600","708500"," Still ping ponging around in here, right?"
"709180","710920"," Just want to bring your attention to this."
"711120","714380"," You want to see like big huge moves down, right?"
"714780","715500"," We talked about that."
"716040","718000"," We'll be flying in an airplane and then boom. "
"718060","718860"," Immediate drop."
"719180","720140"," Same thing right here."
"720280","720440"," Boom. "
"720920","721540"," Immediate drops."
"722000","722580"," Same thing right here."
"723280","723780"," Immediate drop. "
"724440","725500"," Same thing right here."
"725780","725860"," Boom."
"726420","727520"," Not so much, right?"
"727700","728440"," Buy or step it in. "
"728820","728960"," Boom."
"729820","730620"," Immediate drop."
"731800","734500"," It's until we're above this 5180 right here. "
"734920","738400"," But there is some note or something to take note of here."
"739080","739800"," Number one."
"740200","741560"," We're spending a ton of time here. "
"742520","742800"," Okay."
"743680","745500"," You know what this looks like, right?"
"745660","746900"," It does not look like distribution."
"747440","754380"," This looks like trying to find enough buyers for this next leg higher, right?"
"754840","756280"," Trade this new zone to the upside. "
"756860","758160"," And what else is happening here?"
"759420","766700"," Just so you can see, we have some developing upside calls, right?"
"767800","769260"," All the way up to 5,300."
"770260","772180"," I don't see anything up here yet."
"772820","776820"," I'd really like to see 5,500 develop, 5,600 develop. "
"777580","780460"," But what else is fascinating is take a look right here."
"781340","783580"," So real support is starting to move up."
"783760","784200"," You see that?"
"785040","786200"," No puts down here. "
"786520","791960"," Now some of the gamabros are going to tell you because there's no puts down here."
"792420","793860"," That it's dangerous for a crash."
"794420","795180"," I agree with that statement. "
"795760","798300"," But also you see this compressing right here."
"799300","804980"," This is also becoming very supportive for this expansion to the upside."
"805380","809360"," This is telling you we're trying to get range expansion up here. "
"809980","813780"," Now can we blast down below and have an actual legit crash?"
"814240","815460"," Yeah, we got that forming too."
"815640","819640"," But at the same time, your real support is raising up."
"820580","821780"," Raising up is now here. "
"821780","824960"," I realize we're leaving all of this down here exposed."
"825620","833080"," I would still really like to see us come up here and bloodbath down, close that gap, and then right"
"833080","835820"," back up again and continue to the upside."
"836360","837400"," All that stuff right there. "
"838140","842880"," If you are a seasonal trader and you're looking for that seasonal buy, I hope we get it."
"843100","851360"," I hope we get that moment of weakness for just, even if it's for a day, two days, something like"
"851360","851620"," that."
"852300","854540"," So just that's that gamma profile right there. "
"854600","860620"," I'll switch back to the main screen now for you guys."
"861260","862820"," You know, why is that happening?"
"863580","864080"," Hold on here."
"864200","864560"," Where's that?"
"865580","866320"," Bottom right here. "
"866500","869340"," Oh, that's why the chat box is muted."
"870200","873340"," So it carries over to the trigger full screen."
"874660","876080"," Chat box is not muted is it?"
"876160","877040"," That's why it's done. "
"877040","879180"," I got to check that, make sure they have that open."
"880860","886180"," When I'm muted on a different scene, it affects the regular scenes transitions."
"887540","894600"," Okay, so if you guys have really quick in the chat, if you want me to have a revolving chart"
"894600","899520"," down here in the bottom left hand side of your screen, can you tell me in the chat really quick?"
"901420","903080"," Some tickers you'd like to see this morning. "
"903080","906120"," I'll go to you guys for your input."
"908300","911580"," If you guys have a ticker that you want, let me know."
"912280","924480"," What do"
"924480","924940"," you got there?"
"931110","931390"," Move. "
"933870","934930"," Make this bigger."
"937330","937870"," SMCI."
"939650","940630"," I got cues there. "
"942450","942990"," SMCI."
"944090","944790"," Hold on."
"946650","948210"," Guys are going too fast now. "
"954520","955000"," SMCI."
"966970","969670"," Target on SMCI 53587."
"973230","973710"," IWM. "
"974330","974990"," I can do that one."
"997010","1001730"," This is the one that I'm most interested in."
"1002630","1002990"," IWM. "
"1004650","1005010"," PACB."
"1009330","1012310"," All right, so far I've got, so I'll look that one up."
"1012430","1014310"," I'll look at PACB later. "
"1015930","1016290"," PACB."
"1018570","1018930"," PACB."
"1020070","1021670"," There was some other one up in there. "
"1024910","1026390"," I'm just curious with my thoughts."
"1026710","1027650"," Okay, I'll look at it a bit."
"1027869","1029750"," I want to make sure I'm not putting anything up that's a low float. "
"1032150","1033490"," There's another one up there too."
"1033609","1034109"," That's Mara."
"1037569","1038750"," I can put Mara up. "
"1039150","1039490"," I'll do Mara."
"1049730","1050150"," Nice."
"1051210","1051550"," I like it. "
"1053350","1054450"," I like that it's blood."
"1056730","1057970"," That's a good pick right there."
"1062960","1065800"," You guys are probably like, why do you think it's a good pick?"
"1066080","1066440"," It's blood. "
"1067080","1069080"," I fucking hate things that are already trending."
"1069080","1073020"," I really do like something that's like a bloodbath phase."
"1073620","1075600"," We'll put Mara right there. "
"1077340","1081450"," You can see Dilly Trigger's rolling down."
"1082290","1089030"," When you see stuff like this on a ticker like Mara, it looks like it wants to really correct in"
"1089030","1089750"," a big bad way."
"1091830","1098210"," If you want to get bullish on Mara, you're going to want to see the Dilly Trigger come down and"
"1098210","1099230"," price to get above it. "
"1099750","1101870"," Then the hourly trigger to get underneath it."
"1103270","1107490"," Then we can talk about a bold trade on that, but it's getting there."
"1107570","1108830"," It's not there yet, but it's getting there. "
"1109390","1114410"," You definitely do not want to see Mara below $15.29 with the Dilly Trigger in the weekly coming"
"1114410","1115070"," down upon it."
"1115670","1116930"," It is very bad."
"1117630","1119850"," We become like bear market for Mara. "
"1121850","1122410"," All right."
"1122550","1123770"," Back with you guys in just a few moments."
"1126270","1127270"," Of the moment. "
"1127490","1127770"," That's right."
"1127970","1128030"," Yeah."
"1128210","1132690"," You just want to get the ticker in there and you get in the filter and you're all set. "
"1132830","1136950"," At least, although I have heard people say, essentially, it might have overshot, that basically now"
"1136950","1140610"," just feels like everyone has one, so does anybody have one worthwhile?"
"1141170","1142310"," You've been in a partnership with me."
"1142310","1144010"," A partnership or a claimed connection."
"1144650","1147750"," I remember in the boom days of Beyond Meat, it was like that. "
"1147910","1152250"," Every restaurant, every grocery, not making any comparisons."
"1152250","1152510"," That's not."
"1153670","1153990"," All right. "
"1154250","1160870"," Despite all the news, the stock, of course, of Nvidia is down about 2% this morning, and I'm pace"
"1160870","1164670"," to break a 10-week wind streak for more on what we can expect from Nvidia."
"1164930","1168990"," New Street researchers Pierre Fargue joins us live from the GTC."
"1169450","1170630"," It's great to have you. "
"1171210","1176310"," What have you heard so far, if anything, that leads you to either reassess or confirm"
"1176310","1184010"," what you are doing, and I guess the durability of those things?"
"1186260","1186520"," Yes."
"1186640","1192940"," So, what Gensen really focused on last yesterday during the keynote was like the next generation of"
"1192940","1195120"," chips, the new product portfolio."
"1195760","1202020"," And what we saw is achieved, it can train a model four times faster, that can do inference up to"
"1202020","1203240"," like 30 times faster. "
"1204360","1207500"," So still like a very, very, very high pace of innovation."
"1207860","1214480"," Every two years, that's like the five to 10-ex kind of performance improvement in the chips is"
"1214480","1217240"," really what came out today."
"1217560","1218040"," What does that mean?"
"1218220","1222200"," Well, in a world in which your next model is going to be 10 times out there, you will need"
"1222200","1228840"," that new chip that is going to go four to 30 times faster, definitely very good for Nvidia. "
"1228840","1234000"," It also means competing with Nvidia stuff, because if you're a starter, if you're like a team"
"1234000","1238680"," inside Google or inside Microsoft and you're developing your own chip, and you aim for a chip that"
"1238680","1243760"," is 10 times better than the Nvidia chip, you know that the next Nvidia chip that is coming up in"
"1243760","1248420"," the next couple of years, maximum is actually also going to be 10 times better."
"1248700","1250720"," So it's very challenging to compete with Nvidia."
"1250940","1254560"," So what I would take from yesterday's Nvidia will continue to dominate the space. "
"1254900","1259420"," Even if alternatives get into the market, they so much demand that there is room for alternatives."
"1260460","1264700"," Nvidia still is at the top of its game, for sure."
"1265360","1272160"," Yeah, and you know, I know coming into the meeting, you had been using for your price target of 10,"
"1272300","1278360"," 90,000, 90 for Nvidia shares, something about sort of a conservative case for the rate of adoption"
"1278360","1279480"," that's still left upside. "
"1279760","1281020"," You were looking at out two years."
"1281540","1283580"," Is that what you would stick to at this point?"
"1283960","1289620"," I'm trying to define what the remaining investment opportunity is here for this part of this cycle."
"1290800","1292600"," Yeah, that's a very good point. "
"1292600","1298240"," So what's amazing about the world in which we are today about like AI trend is that we don't know"
"1298240","1298700"," what's next."
"1299320","1304660"," You know, as some times say the CEO of an AI, there is this veil of ignorance standing in front"
"1304660","1305100"," of us."
"1305480","1310820"," And the next model, the only thing we know is 10 times bigger to train, 10 times even heavier for"
"1310820","1313320"," our data center, but we don't know what it will deliver. "
"1313660","1316700"," And so we don't know if we are going to continue to increase the size of the model 10 X"
"1316700","1318140"," after this one."
"1318460","1320860"," So how does that translate into the supply chain?"
"1320860","1325660"," That means we have very high visibility on very strong demand until the end of next year."
"1326300","1328500"," And after that, we'll have to wait and see. "
"1328640","1331120"," And so that's the reason why we have this current way to look at Nvidia."
"1331700","1338440"," And our take on the stock today is if AI slows down AI deployment slow down on the back of"
"1338440","1341800"," 2025, AI is still nicely valued."
"1342100","1343940"," It's still like an interesting stock to own. "
"1345080","1349140"," So there is no like submission bubble at this stage despite the run of the stock."
"1349140","1356140"," And if AI continues to really deploy very fast and go like 50%, 60% a year, this stock between"
"1356140","1360200"," now and 2027 still can double or triple relatively easily."
"1360300","1361260"," So we still like the stock. "
"1362400","1366300"," But we want to remind investors that there is a veil of ignorance."
"1366600","1369000"," We don't know what happens beyond 2025."
"1369380","1370540"," And we need to keep an eye on that. "
"1370940","1371800"," And what does that mean?"
"1372280","1377840"," It means looking at how the capabilities of the models are evolving, how adoption is growing."
"1378500","1383260"," And most importantly, how companies are capable of showing they can monetize these massive"
"1383260","1384160"," investments."
"1384920","1388960"," Here, does it make you like some of Nvidia's competitors more or less?"
"1392350","1397050"," So as a competitor to Nvidia today, you have an easy market. "
"1397330","1401570"," If you have a very tough competitor, Nvidia are very good at making the most of their achieve,"
"1401770","1405810"," helping their clients, making the most of their achieve with excellent quality software and"
"1405810","1406110"," ecosystem."
"1406670","1408210"," So it's tough to compete with them."
"1408870","1410650"," But there is such a need for more compute. "
"1410810","1415990"," You know, compute is a new gold rush that all cable competitors are actually doing extremely well."
"1416110","1422590"," I have in mind AMD coming up as an alternative supplier or GPUs with the technology that is like a"
"1422590","1429290"," stock, an overall environment that is inferior to Nvidia, but still sufficiently capable to get"
"1429290","1431750"," into the market with the very strong demand we see."
"1432010","1438450"," We see chips being developed by a large internet player like Google and Amazon for now. "
"1438650","1440470"," They are like in the lead deploying."
"1440710","1446270"," So we expect GPUs in 2027 to be, you know, maybe two-third of the market."
"1446510","1450950"," So that's a lot of room for other chips to get into the market. "
"1451110","1453090"," So competitors are going to come in, are going to be successful."
"1453790","1456610"," But they are not going to hurt Nvidia."
"1456730","1462170"," Nvidia is going to remain in their dominant position, given the strength of their innovation"
"1462170","1462990"," pipeline today. "
"1463430","1465110"," Yeah, dominant, but maybe not alone."
"1465530","1466530"," Pierre, thank you very much."
"1466550","1466670"," Exactly. "
"1466670","1467430"," Appreciate the time."
"1467870","1468850"," All right."
"1469570","1474410"," Benique, the Japanese stock market back above 40,000 as the Bank of Japan officially ends. "
"1475010","1476390"," It's negative interest rate policy."
"1476630","1479710"," We're going to take a look at what it means for the country's economy and the markets moving"
"1479710","1480170"," forward."
"1480170","1483910"," Plus, housing starts rebounding more than 10% in February. "
"1484390","1488070"," The largest gain in nine months will discuss the health of the housing market when we come back"
"1488070","1489690"," with the CEO of TriPoint."
"1493150","1499650"," What others can learn from my journey as a female leader is really resilience and perseverance."
"1500090","1505550"," Many steps along the way, I've experienced challenges and roadblocks and having the ability to move"
"1505550","1510910"," past them to celebrate the small wins and take the challenges as they come. "
"1511410","1514070"," Has been a key part of getting me to this point."
"1741500","1746100"," European markets, mostly as you hire this morning with some economic optimism coming out of"
"1746100","1752920"," Germany, the ZEW economic sentiment survey, smashing expectations, reporting that more than 80% of"
"1752920","1756740"," those surveyed expect the ECB, the central bank to cut rates in the next six months."
"1756740","1759500"," But the big story today comes out of Japan. "
"1759900","1764540"," The country's central bank issuing its first interest rate hike in 17 years."
"1765340","1770640"," The move is only to a range of 0 to 0.1%. It was a 10 basis point increase."
"1771220","1776860"," And the Bank of Japan says it still expects accommodative financial conditions to be maintained for"
"1776860","1777400"," the time being. "
"1778020","1781860"," The Dovish guidance caused the Nikkei to jump above 40,000 for the first time in two weeks."
"1781860","1785540"," Also prompted the end to weaken past $150 per dollar."
"1785660","1790060"," State Street calling the opposing moves a, quote, classic by the rumor sell the fact. "
"1790980","1795180"," Mufg said the weak guidance isn't really enough to drop further hawkish repricing and the query"
"1795180","1799080"," concluding that at the end of the day it's always the Fed that rules and dominates the price"
"1799080","1799600"," action."
"1800400","1807420"," This is, this Bank of Japan Governor Weida adds a whole new level of Dovish-nish to a Dovish"
"1807420","1808380"," central banker."
"1808380","1814060"," So they make their big move to raise my 10 basis points and they got rid of the yield curve"
"1814060","1815780"," control and buying ETFs. "
"1815900","1822460"," However, still use the word accommodative and gave no guidance on further rate heights and whether"
"1822460","1827280"," that will be appropriate and still continuing to buy bonds or do QE."
"1827740","1829680"," So this is about as Dovish as they get."
"1829960","1835760"," Clearly the fear of not having sustainable inflation runs really deep. "
"1835760","1838520"," It's so culturally entrenched in the Bank of Japan."
"1839040","1845420"," They also want to just soften whatever perceived pressures might be caused by this when the Fed is"
"1845420","1847140"," likely to also be cutting."
"1847820","1848700"," The Nikkei loves it. "
"1848880","1851320"," It's been one of the best markets for a year now."
"1851620","1853200"," It's up 20% year to date."
"1853420","1858380"," I think it's finally becoming also a little bit of a hedge fund momentum trade or maybe a lot of"
"1858380","1858600"," one. "
"1859100","1862840"," So it's kind of interesting even though it's not really as much of a shift."
"1863360","1870740"," It's enough, you know, a combative nature of this hike, if you can believe it, is definitely"
"1870740","1871280"," supportive of the equity."
"1871280","1875880"," No, any tightening got already priced in a long time ago and now it's all about the dovishness and"
"1875880","1879680"," lack of a signal of whether more hikes and that's why the yen sold off and won't pass that 150,"
"1880220","1882620"," which does make you wonder if they will have to stand there. "
"1882620","1885940"," Because that's been the ceiling for like 18 months, a couple of times it hit around 150."
"1886160","1890460"," And while the weekend is helpful for manufacturing and certainly for the stock market, at some"
"1890460","1894000"," point, it could potentially cause capital concerns."
"1894120","1894480"," Yeah, for sure. "
"1894780","1896340"," All right, time now for a news update."
"1896560","1898240"," Savannah Hanao has that for us."

"1898940","1900220"," Hey, Mike, good morning to you."
"1900380","1906220"," Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said today Israeli forces must carry out a ground"
"1906220","1908780"," incursion in Rafa in order to destroy Hamas."
"1909600","1914960"," He made the comment just one day after the White House said President Biden expressed deep concerns"

"1924440","1928900"," Meanwhile, Hong Kong Legislature passed a controversial new security law today."
"1929700","1935400"," It builds on one imposed by China following widespread anti-government protest in 2019."
"1935980","1942680"," The new law introduces 39 new national security crimes and expanse penalties that include sentences"
"1942680","1946120"," up to life imprisonment for the most serious offenses. "
"1946120","1951360"," Critics feared the law will have a chilling effect on civilian groups and Hong Kong's business"
"1951360","1951840"," sector."
"1952480","1958460"," And FBI data shows crime rates are declining in the U.S. The new fourth quarter number show murders"
"1958460","1965900"," dropped 13% from 2022 to 2023 violent crime and property crime also went down."
"1966320","1972640"," The data is based on information from about 13,000 agencies across the U.S. Sarah. "
"1973420","1974360"," Good news."
"1974560","1980680"," I had why the potential for even three interest rate cuts from the Fed this year could be in"
"1980680","1980960"," question."
"1981280","1985100"," Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management CIO joined us ahead of tomorrow's big Fed decision. "
"1985700","1987740"," He's getting cautious on large caps stocks."
"1988080","1990360"," Stay with us."
"2217580","2225300"," With an eye on the Fed decision tomorrow, our next guest sees a mild recession ahead and thinks"
"2225300","2231080"," even three rate cuts might be in question for this year, favoring small and mid caps as the S&P"
"2231080","2231880"," keeps broadening. "
"2231980","2235500"," Joining us now is Northwestern Mutual Asset Management CIO, Brent Schutte."
"2235680","2239180"," He oversees more than $280 billion in assets under management."
"2239460","2240660"," Brent, it's good to see you. "
"2240800","2246000"," I guess to the degree there is suspense going into tomorrow, it's how is Powell going to sound in"
"2246000","2251860"," terms of his characterization of this uptick in inflation, how tolerant the committee is of this,"
"2252380","2254840"," and then resetting the rate path."
"2255160","2258580"," What do you expect and I guess how much do you expect it to matter to the market?"
"2259420","2264080"," I think it matters quite a bit because most of the expectations this year, at least a lot of the"
"2264080","2266140"," optimism based on rates coming down."
"2266720","2272760"," If you look at CIO surveys, they list one of the big optimistic reasons for 2024 rates coming down. "
"2273000","2276020"," Look at the University of Michigan, our Consumer Confidence Conference Board."
"2276020","2277720"," They list rates coming down."
"2278120","2280720"," I think the reality is inflation isn't moving lower. "
"2281000","2282660"," The pace is actually moving higher."
"2283000","2284540"," You can see that in sticky CPI."
"2285060","2287360"," You can see that in the Cleveland Fed median CPI. "
"2287960","2292720"," You can look at the distribution of PCE components rising 3% plus, being at levels not seen since"
"2292720","2294280"," the 1980s, late 80s."
"2294820","2299420"," And to me, the reactive Fed, the data dependent Fed, is not seeing what they want to see on the"
"2299420","2300100"," inflation front."
"2300420","2304180"," And that's why I think they're going to have to put a little bit of dent in the optimism that's"
"2304180","2306640"," out there right now about rates possibly going lower. "
"2307200","2311480"," And I wouldn't be surprised to the dot plot move to only two rate cuts this year, which is much"
"2311480","2312700"," different than what we were in January."
"2312880","2315900"," But the market is still somehow higher, which I think is the big disconnect."
"2316380","2318140"," Well, that was just going to say that. "
"2318260","2325000"," I mean, it seems as if fewer and later rate cuts has been absorbed reasonably well by the market"
"2325000","2329940"," because it's sort of falling back on both the resilience of the economy, at least as far as we can"
"2329940","2334120"," tell, earnings turning higher, and of course the whole AI excitement."
"2335480","2339640"," Yeah, I think the last thing is very big because most of the excitement that you've seen is in"
"2339640","2341720"," those AI stocks, the S&P is really concentrated."
"2342500","2346800"," And it's been the leading index for quite some time right now, which I think the small mid-cap"
"2346800","2348140"," comments you made about my likes. "
"2348440","2351620"," I think that's largely because I don't think they have participated to the extent."
"2351840","2353700"," I think they've already priced in some sort of a mild recession."
"2354220","2359020"," And I do think once rate cuts arrive, kind of like what happened in the late 1990s, those parts of"
"2359020","2361060"," the market will do relatively better than large cap. "
"2361780","2363480"," And so I think the market is in for a wake-up call."
"2363680","2370100"," I think it will eventually have a moment where it actually sees a recession that's still likely as"
"2370100","2375280"," the impact of those rate hikes that we had in the past continue to work their way into the economy,"
"2375660","2381560"," which they haven't as much yet because most of the debt in this economy was termed out or fixed on"
"2381560","2384480"," the consumer's balance sheet because of the impact of fixed rate mortgages."
"2384480","2390160"," But you're seeing that reprice and consumer debt right now has interest costs that essentially"
"2390160","2391460"," doubled over the past couple of years. "
"2392260","2396460"," So as we start to feel the impact of that, Grant, won't that hurt value in small cap stocks?"
"2397500","2398660"," It possibly would."
"2398800","2400040"," And this is not necessarily a time in call."
"2400160","2401780"," I tend to think in 12 to 18 month chunks. "
"2402580","2405520"," And if you think back to 1999, this is a period that rhymes a lot with this."
"2406020","2411100"," Small and mid dramatically underperformed going into that recession or towards the end of it as"
"2411100","2416100"," internet stocks, the concentrated S&P kind of ripped on optimism about the internet and what it was"
"2416100","2420420"," going to happen going forward, as that recession kind of became more virality, those asset classes"
"2420420","2422140"," did a lot better on a relative basis."
"2422880","2427320"," And then coming out of that recession, they did incredibly well, which I think kind of a path for"
"2427320","2428700"," what I think is going to happen in the future. "
"2429020","2434200"," And I do want to reiterate, I think it's a mild and shallow recession for a variety of reasons, but"
"2434200","2437020"," that will mean more of a mild decline in the equity markets."
"2437020","2442220"," Yeah, also relevant that, you know, small and mid, you said did better relatively."
"2442660","2446380"," A lot of that was large cap growth, just getting smoked after the peak in 2000. "
"2446860","2447760"," Grant, appreciate the time."
"2447860","2448420"," Thank you very much."

"2705920","2709600"," He's been in a restructuring sort of turnaround mode since coming on SEO."
"2710500","2712480"," And investors were clearly looking for something bold."
"2712720","2715960"," I would just say that Ben and Jerry's has been a particular headache. "
"2716160","2716640"," Yeah, sure."
"2716680","2718020"," Ice cream business hasn't grown much."
"2718280","2719360"," It's, yeah, exactly. "
"2719860","2724300"," But Ben and Jerry's with its like autonomous board under the parent company."
"2724300","2729680"," They have had legal battles where Ben and Jerry sued its parent company."
"2729680","2736780"," Well, because they take extremely progressive, one would say woke positions. "
"2736920","2739620"," They're almost a social justice company more than they are."
"2739920","2741520"," Yeah, it's also interesting."
"2741760","2743960"," There's going to be a pure pure play ice cream stock out there. "
"2744040","2746520"," I don't think there is one except for Cold Stone, which is ice cream shops."
"2746660","2748420"," But we'll see."
"2748800","2749100"," I don't know. "
"2749560","2751120"," Also, what if they tried to sell it?"
"2751280","2751980"," That would be the other piece."
"2752180","2752300"," What?"
"2752680","2754020"," You would think they would have tried to sell it."
"2754040","2756620"," Maybe they have already been in the ice cream business. "
"2756620","2757680"," Let's talk housing."
"2758000","2761560"," Yesterday, new data showing home builder sentiment turned positive for the first time in eight"
"2761560","2761780"," months."
"2762300","2766100"," And then this morning, we've got February housing starts and building permits, both coming in above"
"2766100","2767240"," expectations as well. "
"2767680","2772120"," Now the focus turns to the Fed and how any change in monetary policy could impact mortgage rates"
"2772120","2773020"," and the housing market."
"2773380","2776060"," Let's bring in tri-point homes, CEO Doug Bauer."
"2776680","2780340"," Doug, it's good to have you wondering about just the numbers today. "
"2780780","2781480"," If you can shed some light."
"2781740","2783560"," There was a dip in January because of weather."
"2783560","2789160"," Was this just a give back or are you really starting to see some excitement around building?"
"2790300","2791220"," Thanks, Sarah. "
"2791520","2796620"," You know, the early innings of the spring selling season are very strong."
"2797040","2799520"," The consumer is engaged."
"2800220","2801420"," Orders are going well. "
"2802220","2808760"," And there's really three factors that drive the spring selling season and the, and really the home"
"2808760","2809620"," building market."
"2809620","2816080"," I mean, the housing, the new housing market has been under built since the great financial crisis"
"2816080","2818300"," by millions of homes."
"2819220","2821140"," The resale market is locked. "
"2821980","2823460"," And that's our primary competitor."
"2823900","2828160"," The resale market is selling about over a million less homes per year."
"2828940","2830160"," And the last thing is the demand. "
"2830840","2835820"," The millennial and Gen Z's, which represent 65% of our buyers."
"2836540","2839260"," They're just at the early stages of their formation."
"2839280","2842380"," So the market conditions are very strong. "
"2843020","2845760"," Clearly, there is a supply demand mismatch."
"2845760","2847180"," And that's been a big part of the story."
"2847340","2851700"," Mike was talking about just how strong these stocks, your stocks, home builders have performed,"
"2851740","2853660"," even in a weak housing environment. "
"2854260","2856500"," At what point does supply catch up with demand?"
"2858120","2860080"," That's, that's the million dollar question."
"2860080","2866920"," And I think the redfin CEO mentioned this, I think it was yesterday, until there's more housing"
"2866920","2873680"," supply put into the market, you're not going to see that catch up for a while."
"2874180","2879980"," And with higher mortgage rates, it continues to lock in that resale market. "
"2880320","2886320"," And right now, new home builders represent over 30% of the total home sale environment."
"2887060","2889700"," Typically, that's in the low to mid in the mid teens."
"2890300","2896560"," So, you know, we work right now, you know, all that, those macro factors line up for a very strong"
"2896560","2898620"," housing market for several years. "
"2899540","2901100"," You know, it's pretty well understood."
"2901100","2905420"," I think that the advantage that the builders have to get by down the mortgage rate can compete"
"2905420","2905740"," better."
"2905740","2908060"," And obviously, you know, you can create your own supply. "
"2908380","2908920"," That's what you do."
"2909320","2914960"," But you have seen a relatively high percentage of homes that have had price cuts from their initial"
"2914960","2915660"," listing price."
"2915880","2920360"," It just seems as if at some point we're going to get far enough away from the lock in of"
"2920360","2923940"," mortgage rates that some more inventory is going to start to come out on that market. "
"2925300","2929540"," Mike, I think that's going to take a while with rates where they are."
"2929800","2935800"," And as long as mortgage rates stay in that six to seven percent range."
"2936360","2943120"," So, you know, our focus is really to continue to grow scale where we have our operations and take"
"2943120","2947720"," advantage of that lack of supply as we look forward into the future. "
"2948560","2950160"," So, what happens to prices?"
"2950940","2956880"," Because the whole point of the Fed's hikes, one of the was to bring down prices and especially on"
"2956880","2958200"," housing, which has been sticky."
"2958980","2961740"," You clearly have still this big supply demand mismatch."
"2961740","2962700"," What's that going to do?"
"2963780","2967120"," Well, interest rates really don't drive the demand of housing. "
"2967460","2969660"," It drives pricing that you alluded to, Sarah."
"2969660","2975180"," So, as rates go up, pricing has been stickier, not as elastic."
"2975860","2977760"," As rates go down, it gets more elastic. "
"2978520","2985020"," What drives housing is really the job market, household formations, this demand environment that"
"2985020","2985500"," we're at."
"2985760","2992380"," So, I think, I think until there's greater supply, this is a very fundamental economic equation."
"2992640","2998900"," We need more supply, both in the retail market and in the new home building market. "
"2998900","3001780"," In the new home building market, we're starting more homes."
"3001780","3009080"," As reported, our company is guiding to 17% more deliveries than 24 over 23."
"3010180","3013300"," So, that growth engine is in place for tri-point. "
"3013920","3016000"," As a matter of fact, we've been growing our book value for share."
"3016180","3016400"," All right."
"3016780","3017860"," Here I am here. "
"3017980","3018620"," Give me a couple seconds."
"3019720","3021360"," Those goals of growing book value."
"3022240","3024040"," Turn that down right there. "
"3033810","3037510"," That up, break time, be right back."
"3038170","3038870"," Old man."
"3040250","3040510"," Okay. "
"3042610","3046170"," So, we're going to go over here and just look at."
"3047430","3048670"," I got holes."
"3052290","3054690"," Now what are we looking at here?"
"3056550","3057550"," Take a peek. "
"3063920","3067120"," Where are the real sellers at here, right?"
"3067840","3069160"," When volatility began."
"3070960","3074520"," Let's take a look back here in time and just see where they all are, right?"
"3074700","3075180"," They're right up here."
"3075400","3077280"," They're right up here, like 5, 16, 62. "
"3078440","3079940"," We know where the sellers are."
"3080140","3081300"," They're way up here, right?"
"3081580","3082140"," It's where they started."
"3082640","3083000"," And look at that. "
"3083160","3083940"," They're right there again."
"3084340","3086020"," 5, 16, 62, right up there."
"3087140","3089420"," And they came down a little bit over here. "
"3090040","3091980"," Slightly down a little bit more, right?"
"3093120","3095820"," 5, 15, 32 is where they are."
"3097720","3099560"," So what do they want to do in here, right?"
"3099800","3103180"," They want to do the same thing and they want to get more aggressive too, right?"
"3103860","3106300"," We don't have that much vol left doing."
"3106900","3110160"," As a matter of fact, let's take a look at the vol picture. "
"3112400","3113440"," Got the money volatility."
"3114600","3118560"," Let's take a look here and see what we can see."
"3121000","3122140"," A cap screen. "
"3123780","3125400"," And let's see at at the money vol."
"3126940","3129200"," This is now, I've shown you guys earlier."
"3130540","3135760"," I've shown you guys, this is from the other day, but I've shown you guys this chart earlier in the"
"3135760","3137060"," week and last week, right?"
"3138760","3148360"," And some of the vol pictures changed, hasn't it?"
"3148360","3149220"," As of tomorrow. "
"3150600","3153720"," So you're going to expect, this is the 20th, right?"
"3154260","3156100"," So you're expected vol to go up into the 20th."
"3156160","3160780"," We're actually expecting it to be maintained higher after tomorrow."
"3161060","3163060"," Now they're saying, hey, maybe not. "
"3163240","3165780"," Maybe we sell the vol into tomorrow."
"3167740","3174800"," So today, at least the vol picture, the after money SPX, vol pictures telling you, no, right?"
"3174800","3182680"," It's telling you that they're going to expect vol to leave the market tomorrow."
"3182960","3185780"," Your most volatile moment will be today into tomorrow. "
"3186460","3188780"," So we're seeing this blast up higher right now."
"3189660","3194460"," And if we're going to have some vol come into the picture tomorrow, where would that place be?"
"3195140","3196860"," It's probably going to be, right?"
"3197580","3202380"," Looking back in time up here at 5, 15 and change."
"3203380","3207540"," That would be your best trade for the volatility trade into tomorrow. "
"3207960","3209840"," Probably up there, it's your best trade."
"3210840","3214560"," And then your next best trade, if they're going to push it down, is probably right here."
"3215480","3216960"," So they push this one down already. "
"3217820","3220940"," And they're probably going to try to get aggressive right here."
"3221800","3223620"," So they're not aggressive right here right now."
"3223800","3225580"," They're aggressive up here right now. "
"3225580","3226260"," Okay."
"3227960","3234680"," So it's probably a seller going, hey, fuck you, we already sold this up here, right?"
"3235580","3237520"," So this is where we're going to sell it again."
"3238620","3239080"," Right?"
"3239260","3241800"," Or maybe even down here a little bit get more aggressive, right?"
"3242460","3244060"," So there's two actions going on. "
"3244200","3248120"," One is going to be sellers stepping in right here."
"3248920","3249160"," For sure."
"3249740","3252380"," And seller is also being up here ready to go. "
"3252380","3254420"," It's like I don't have like two places."
"3255160","3259820"," So the first moment of volatility is going to be right where you are right now."
"3261320","3263760"," Like right now, we kind of already hit that target. "
"3263760","3265120"," See that target up here?"
"3265880","3266780"," Kind of already hit it."
"3267380","3270360"," See that little sneaky little, little, little trade right there?"
"3272540","3274920"," That's those sellers already stepping in going, nope."
"3276460","3279360"," Your hedge till tomorrow until volatility kicks off. "
"3281020","3282040"," Or goes away."
"3282260","3282860"," But I'll tell you this."
"3283180","3285520"," Even right here where we are right now, right?"
"3286220","3295880"," That once tomorrow is done, that's kind of like the last day for them"
"3295880","3301400"," for us or buyers of volatility and sellers of market. "
"3301800","3307220"," This is their last chance or at least the SPX at the money vault curve is stating that right now."
"3307220","3311120"," So just right now, I would expect."
"3311760","3313060"," I'm going to tell you this, right?"
"3313220","3314680"," Say it really loud to you right now. "
"3316680","3318180"," Say it crystal click."
"3321340","3324720"," Sellers and vol bulls."
"3325160","3326780"," This is their last chance. "
"3328520","3331020"," You know, right where we are right now."
"3332500","3333860"," They sold it right here."
"3333880","3334920"," This was the actual tick. "
"3336260","3337340"," Right there, you can see it."
"3339620","3342940"," And they want their last chance of volatility."
"3344400","3345540"," So that's what they want. "
"3345720","3346680"," They want their last chance."
"3347960","3351620"," And you know, there is a time to kind of give into that."
"3352360","3356280"," I know that a lot of times out there, you as a trader, you're like, well, fuck that. "
"3356360","3360400"," I want to buy a dip and run it up to the moon every time again and again and again"
"3360400","3361700"," and again and again."
"3362100","3363600"," I want to do it on the daily trigger."
"3363900","3365180"," I want to do it on the hourly trigger. "
"3365440","3368300"," I want to do it on the one minute, the five minute and I'm going to run over all these"
"3368300","3368620"," sellers."
"3369740","3372540"," I'm going to run over all these vol buyers and all that."
"3372720","3375420"," But I want you to know that every once in a while, they get a chance. "
"3376360","3380780"," You know, even if it's not going to result in a blast down on the depths of hell, they're going"
"3380780","3381220"," to get a chance."
"3381580","3382940"," This is their last chance."
"3385160","3385780"," This is it. "
"3386360","3387160"," This is their last chance."
"3387440","3388920"," So here are their two places."
"3390500","3392060"," You got your first place right here. "
"3392580","3393980"," We're going to write it up here for you."
"3394100","3394220"," Okay."
"3394560","3395860"," We're going to draw it in for you right now. "
"3397920","3399300"," We're going to call this a."
"3401860","3403040"," We're going to call this young."
"3405540","3407000"," What do we call these guys again?"
"3407340","3408280"," Young Jim Bros, right?"
"3410120","3411160"," Young Jim Bros."
"3415660","3419240"," These are the guys that want to be. "
"3419240","3423220"," They want to be a sexy Miro."
"3428160","3429920"," They're not Miro yet, though."
"3430020","3430380"," They're an older. "
"3431760","3432700"," Miro's got a few years."
"3432940","3435580"," He's like, yeah, I've been working out a little longer than these young bloods."
"3436460","3438440"," These are your young Jim Bros down here. "
"3438540","3438860"," They're angry."
"3439160","3439980"," They're like, let's go."
"3440200","3440640"," Let's get it on. "
"3440820","3441800"," We're going to crash the market."
"3442560","3444260"," We've got the young stuff going on."
"3444680","3448920"," We've got the end of, you know, the, uh, Japan being loose. "
"3448920","3449320"," The money."
"3449320","3451520"," I don't care about what the treasure is doing."
"3452520","3456300"," And then down here, you also have up here, you've got the old Jim Bros. "
"3456580","3458100"," These are the guys you really got to watch out for."
"3458240","3463380"," These fucking guys up here, you know, they haven't been able to shine at all this quarter."
"3464980","3466320"," Look at the old Jim Bros. "
"3467780","3468540"," They're up here."
"3471200","3475920"," Well, matter of fact, we won't give them capital letters because they're just waiting."
"3476440","3477640"," These guys are always cool. "
"3477640","3478900"," They just wait up here."
"3479100","3479880"," They know what's up."
"3480040","3480560"," They just chill. "
"3481560","3482700"," Young Jim Bros get aggressive."
"3483140","3484400"," They're like slam, slam, slam, slam."
"3484400","3485220"," Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. "
"3485680","3486420"," Old Jim Bros."
"3486560","3489720"," Like I'm going to wait up here and I'm going to rain down some shit if they try squeezing this"
"3489720","3489980"," shit."
"3490400","3491320"," So they're way up there. "
"3491660","3492180"," Old Jim Bros."
"3492440","3493000"," Young Jim Bros."
"3493420","3494120"," I'll tell you what. "
"3494240","3495540"," These old and young Jim Bros."
"3496360","3500120"," They know something that scares them."
"3501180","3502540"," Especially these guys up here. "
"3502680","3503240"," These old Jim Bros."
"3503380","3503720"," No better."
"3504900","3505860"," Especially in this regime. "
"3506960","3507820"," What do they know?"
"3508320","3509300"," You don't want me to tell you?"
"3510200","3514320"," They know that we buy Vol into events right now."
"3514720","3519580"," And when we go into an event, we fucking leave bag holders everywhere."
"3521280","3523920"," We don't actually follow through with it right now, do we?"
"3524680","3531300"," So if you're like, if you're buying Vol into an event right now, like yes, this is fucking awesome. "
"3531460","3533140"," It's fucking great buying the Vol."
"3534120","3534920"," Everything is great."
"3535400","3535960"," Everything is awesome. "
"3536140","3537660"," Vol utility is now an asset class."
"3538040","3539720"," Even if it's only for the next three days."
"3540800","3545220"," We're not holding the Vol into the actual event. "
"3546600","3547220"," Are we?"
"3548660","3550960"," They're like leaving you bag holding like the day before."
"3551660","3554200"," And then you're getting fucked in the market."
"3554360","3555260"," The Vol comes off the market. "
"3555580","3556820"," What happens if Vol comes off the market?"

"3561200","3562220"," The market fucking blasts."
"3563140","3564120"," Rifts faces up."
"3564620","3570960"," So I'm going to be kind of thinking here that if I was an old Jim bro, I'd be hanging"
"3570960","3573420"," out way up here, not particularly right here. "
"3574120","3576040"," I'd be like, yeah, I'm going to go up here and just chill out."

"3589420","3590640"," Not going to be wrong on this."
"3591480","3593520"," These young Jim bros are sometimes right."
"3594320","3596120"," But the one scare it's fair. "
"3596320","3598880"," That was this fire of all."
"3599720","3603800"," As the closer we get into tomorrow's event, the more I'd be flinching."
"3603840","3605820"," And more I'd be like, I don't know. "
"3606640","3608240"," Can't drink the Kool-Aid right now."
"3608360","3611380"," Every time I drink the Kool-Aid, I get fucking run over."
"3613160","3614760"," So, you know, you can step. "
"3614760","3621600"," I guess my point here would be if you want to go into a vol trade, this is one of"
"3621600","3621980"," the places."
"3623060","3627340"," And if you wanted to wait, or if you wanted to like start here and then do a second trade"
"3627340","3630460"," here, that seems reasonable and rational."
"3632180","3637760"," If you want that volatility trade one more time tomorrow, this is your first place with the young"
"3637760","3641720"," Jim bros are, and this is your second place with the old Jim bros are up here. "
"3642640","3644040"," Do they have another chance?"

"3670880","3676360"," And, you know, they'll pin this market down into tomorrow's meeting, right?"
"3678200","3679440"," So, just be patient."
"3680040","3681840"," There's the only thing that I would leave you with at the moment. "
"3683000","3684460"," You know how it goes here, right?"
"3685200","3687240"," Extremes on the downside, extremes on the upside."
"3688640","3690640"," Don't mess around in the middle, right?"
"3691000","3693920"," So, let's go back to a one-hour chart."
"3698670","3699870"," Let's just take a look at this. "
"3704130","3707070"," And let's see who's won these trades."
"3713200","3717700"," I bet you there's like, I bet you there's like, there's got to be like a bear somewhere."
"3717980","3720000"," It's like, it's a big bear flag. "
"3722480","3726860"," It's been a fucking big bear flag for like, ever and ever and ever."
"3727040","3728480"," It's been one big long bear flag."
"3729520","3731180"," But anyways, my point here is this. "
"3732060","3733220"," The point still stands."
"3736520","3738300"," Buyers, sellers, right?"
"3740100","3741740"," Buyers, sellers, right?"
"3743260","3744340"," Buyers, sellers."
"3744800","3746180"," Sellers get a little more aggressive. "
"3746360","3746740"," You notice that?"
"3747860","3752020"," Higher high, no higher high, no higher high."
"3752740","3753780"," One, two, three."
"3754500","3755980"," Getting a little aggressive there, aren't they?"
"3757280","3759880"," So, they're going to try to get more aggressive here, aren't they?"
"3759880","3765280"," They're going to get real aggressive down here and attempt to get that push down here and tomorrow. "
"3765500","3767180"," Do I think they get that push down there?"
"3767380","3767580"," I do."
"3768900","3769800"," I'll give them that."
"3769960","3770380"," They'll get that. "
"3770660","3772320"," I would like to see them get it anyways."
"3773440","3777700"," But I don't think it leads to what they think it's leading to, which is that blood bath, that doom"
"3777700","3778020"," and gloom."
"3778380","3778820"," I don't. "
"3779940","3782300"," Now, they don't have a lot of time left for it to happen."
"3782580","3789820"," So, just as we get up into these moments here, I would not shock me to see right around around"
"3789820","3791200"," like 2 p.m. or so."
"3791720","3794880"," 2.30. It might be the cell signal 1.30 in the eye. "
"3794960","3797840"," It's usually starts like 1.30. Or I shouldn't say that."
"3798180","3800160"," Right around 1.30, the buyers usually come in."
"3800420","3802620"," Like the bulls would come in from like 1.30 until 2."
"3803220","3807180"," And then right around 2 p.m. You'll see that cell action in the market. "

"3824520","3827180"," half to two hours of whatever it is they're doing."
"3831380","3834720"," And bring this over here for you. "
"3836120","3839460"," All right, it's probably another hour and a half of buying action going on."
"3840360","3853000"," And then right around 2 p.m. You"
"3853000","3854700"," know, let's put this right here where they are."
"3854820","3856260"," So they can get smashed in the face. "
"3856780","3858120"," They can punch right in the head."
"3861880","3863200"," Stand back, young bro."
"3864020","3864800"," Stand back. "
"3867920","3869360"," And we'll see how this goes."

"4598500","4600120"," You thought the iPhone was cool."
"4601420","4604000"," Even if it even if it turns out that it's a scam. "
"4604560","4607620"," And I want you to see this too."
"4607840","4611920"," There is a volatility here, but your next target to the upside is 51."
"4612600","4612740"," 51. "
"4614020","4614140"," 5."
"4614640","4615420"," 50 on spoons."
"4620360","4622020"," Oh, yeah, we have a lot of time left."
"4622020","4626220"," Do we 12 20 now 40 minutes to get up to 51 51. "
"4627900","4629680"," I'll just call 5 1 5 flat."
"4630060","4630740"," Yep, we got it."
"4630880","4632000"," We have 40 minutes to get up there. "
"4636060","4637820"," So can you get my tea on Tesla?"
"4638420","4640440"," You got him every night on the website every night."
"4640540","4643940"," I talk about Tesla or at least three nights a week Mondays Tuesday or Mondays, Wednesdays and"
"4643940","4644120"," Fridays."
"4644900","4645680"," You get Tesla. "
"4645960","4647940"," So you want to ask people from."
"4649080","4651720"," The community and have have them help you out at the moment."
"4652300","4652780"," So. "
"4657220","4658080"," We get finished."
"4658160","4660240"," What was my thought process rose on here."
"4661620","4662100"," So. "
"4664260","4664740"," So."
"4667420","4670380"," Be of a at least or a little or back then VDA."
"4671200","4675640"," If you think I think we have this on this show we discussed and VDA. "
"4676440","4680020"," Remember when the NBA DA first started taking off and people were like."
"4680780","4683220"," It's going to be a bad and it's going to be."
"4683960","4688340"," It's going to be what it's a bubble and it's going to be a short lived. "
"4689140","4691080"," And I was like, no, like."
"4691800","4692880"," 750 is."
"4693520","4695060"," 750 is the target. "
"4695840","4697900"," And now we're hearing 1700."
"4699640","4700080"," Is the target."
"4700580","4702160"," I think that's easily doable. "
"4704360","4707900"," AI is has the potential to change the world."
"4708680","4713420"," And actually is the next is existential threat to some kind of war."
"4714440","4714860"," Danger. "
"4715280","4716620"," There's a lot of danger with AI too."
"4718980","4721420"," But you know, to say that it's like."
"4721980","4724540"," Say that that time that it was going to be short live. "
"4724840","4725340"," That's been wrong."
"4725880","4728340"," And you're getting a pullback right now and VDA."
"4729020","4732820"," I mean, you get a consolidation sideways pullback and then VDA. "
"4734740","4737580"," Do I think that that's trying to create bag holders?"
"4738680","4739580"," Probably not."
"4741180","4743780"," It's probably going to just continue up higher."
"4744360","4746900"," This is a fundamental change whether you like it or not. "
"4747040","4747620"," I don't like it."
"4747880","4748940"," I'll tell you that right now."
"4748940","4751380"," I'm not fan of where we're going with AI. "
"4752200","4757080"," But to just deny it is you losing."
"4757340","4758420"," You're fucking losing."
"4759080","4760760"," I don't have to say to you. "
"4761260","4764400"," Like the trader hat and the main street hat are two different things."
"4766780","4768780"," If you wanted your chance, you got it."
"4769140","4769820"," It's here. "
"4775500","4776200"," What else?"
"4777860","4778620"," That's all I got."
"4779160","4780740"," So old Jim Barrows up high."
"4780740","4783480"," Young Jim Barrows getting run over right now. "
"4783500","4784360"," Thanks pretty hard."
"4784900","4786820"," Hopefully get a little consolidation back here."
"4787260","4787820"," We'll pull back. "
"4787940","4792160"," I'd like to see like the squeeze up pullback and then maybe a quick drop and then rip there."
"4793540","4794700"," We'll see if that happens."
"4795080","4799740"," They might just run it straight up into this bond auction at one, two. "
"4806500","4807480"," I see 450."
"4808100","4811380"," Like I see like you guys know what I'm looking at."
"4811580","4813960"," Like SPX. "
"4814180","4816220"," I see 6000 like December."
"4818660","4819740"," 5960 December."
"4820640","4820940"," March. "
"4822180","4822420"," That worst."
"4825020","4826060"," Say it all the time."
"4830620","4833960"," I think you're out of your mind if you don't think we're going there. "
"4834400","4842560"," I think that I think that Tom Lee is under understating where we're going."
"4844800","4845420"," Which lecture?"
"4845720","4846960"," I didn't miss that part of the conversation."
"4847340","4848280"," I didn't see that Jimmy. "
"4848480","4849360"," I didn't see any of that."
"4855560","4857100"," Am I still on the chaos?"
"4857100","4858520"," Yeah, we're coming up there."
"4858680","4858960"," Yes. "
"4859140","4860140"," Yeah, we're coming up there."
"4860620","4862020"," We're doing it all week long, right?"
"4862240","4863120"," What do we say last week?"
"4863540","4866360"," I told you guys last week on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday."
"4867060","4867760"," What did I say?"
"4868400","4869820"," I said trade the extremes. "
"4870960","4872500"," So you buy the dips to sell the rips."
"4872920","4873360"," That's what you do."
"4873840","4875700"," And then tomorrow the vol is done. "
"4876420","4877900"," We'll go back to trade in the one minute shit."
"4879140","4879500"," Simple."
"4886740","4888580"," Squeezing out the bears one more time here. "
"4888580","4889440"," It's like clockwork."
"4895640","4898080"," You guys want to see the chart from last night?"
"4900300","4901760"," Let me ask you guys a question."
"4902740","4906460"," Those of you who saw the chart from last night when I said we're going up here today. "
"4908000","4908800"," We did it."
"4909460","4910360"," We're doing it right now."
"4911040","4912260"," I don't have to say to you. "
"4916500","4917380"," So bad."
"4922320","4924040"," All that doom and gloom in the overnight."
"4924320","4925540"," All that shit like"
"4927880","4938780"," didn't"
"4942460","4942460"," matter. "
"4946840","4951160"," I get one p.m. Get a bond auction."
"4959560","4962720"," I love you Marmot burr."
"4974330","4974770"," Literally. "
"4976610","4977490"," Who said that?"
"4978710","4979610"," I don't know who said that."
"4979730","4981370"," Someone just said they're up three pennies or something."
"4983410","4988570"," Let's take a look at. "
"4992610","4994330"," I don't know what to do anymore."
"4997550","5020780"," Let's take a look."
"5027600","5028320"," This is. "
"5031420","5032480"," Sorry I'm giggling."
"5032740","5034100"," You guys get me all fucking."
"5036160","5037020"," Hold on. "
"5042090","5043410"," I opened that or no."
"5045590","5047390"," This is the chart from last night."
"5048450","5050450"," I gave this to you at eight o'clock last night. "
"5051130","5053110"," I don't know what you guys want."
"5055470","5057470"," This is the chart down here from last night."
"5059710","5061050"," Do you guys need more than that?"
"5066720","5067540"," You want hugs?"
"5071280","5072720"," I don't know what you want. "
"5076620","5078180"," What else I can do for you?"
"5086380","5087800"," I don't know what else to do."
"5087940","5088340"," Try it."
"5093580","5096060"," If it goes the other way, we know where it goes the other way too. "
"5096580","5098640"," Even let's say it didn't work out."
"5098980","5100980"," We even know where the selling is."
"5101300","5102220"," It's on the hourly trigger. "
"5103200","5107300"," Even if we didn't go up today, we're like, yeah, we at least know where the sellers can come in."
"5109500","5109980"," Right?"
"5115170","5116890"," I love you too, Momoland."
"5118330","5119730"," I might throw up on the stream. "
"5120270","5121550"," I'm pretty nauseous at the moment."
"5121730","5122590"," Just a heads up out there."
"5125330","5126430"," What a bliss with. "
"5130230","5131770"," I'm about to throw up right now."
"5132130","5134290"," I might just I might just hurl here."
"5134290","5136310"," I'm like around the cost by nausea. "
"5137230","5139110"," Ten was throw up about nine right now."
"5142230","5143110"," Oh, is it really?"
"5143450","5144530"," Okay, thanks for saying something."
"5145390","5146330"," I'm pretty close to it. "
"5147830","5152730"," If I get that close, I might just mute the video so you don't see it at least."
"5155830","5156990"," Thanks for saying something."
"5158930","5161210"," Young Jim bros getting run over right now. "
"5163250","5165730"," I bet you they're hooting and hollering right now on Twitter."
"5166710","5167670"," They got to be."
"5171830","5173310"," I'm ready for measurement. "
"5178010","5179690"," ASMR's puking so stay on street."
"5181370","5184010"," I'm feeling pretty fucking pretty fucking gross the moment."
"5191520","5193960"," Is this thing bouncing between all these charts or no?"
"5195940","5198560"," That's MCI QQ sexy man. "
"5198800","5201620"," Two is the double bottom on the daily trigger."
"5202780","5206700"," Nvidia baby squeeze and I are right now bros."
"5207540","5209420"," Drew that one out for you earlier. "
"5210820","5213420"," What up NVDA crushing it right now."
"5218600","5222280"," SPX coming up into resistance up here."
"5223440","5224500"," You can see it right there. "
"5225120","5226680"," Just ripping some faces off."
"5229180","5230520"," I'm going to throw the fuck up dude."
"5231140","5232200"," I'm not going to make this. "
"5241480","5242360"," Give me a few minutes."
"5262340","5264840"," It's 49% above it's 200 day."
"5265520","5268640"," So like give it a breather perfectly perfectly okay here. "
"5269120","5275100"," But again, I'm a long term investor and cyber security is not going to get easier to deal with."
"5275100","5275920"," It'll only get harder."
"5276500","5280940"," AI will be a tool that cyber criminals have at their disposal. "
"5281800","5284440"," And there's just going to be an arms race to keep up with that."
"5284720","5289900"," This is the best performing of the cyber security names of all the names that exist out there."
"5289960","5292580"," This is the one that I've owned and I'll continue to own. "
"5292580","5299740"," I think George Kurtz is just an incredible leader for the company and visionary and I want to stay."
"5300160","5302300"," So I'm long term and I'm not going anywhere."
"5302300","5303460"," All right. "
"5303580","5303820"," Got it."
"5304040","5306740"," CrowdStrike is a winner for Josh now in the long term."
"5306920","5308920"," Let's move over to our headlines with Julia Morrison. "
"5309300","5309580"," Hi, Julia."
"5311460","5316160"," Courtney, former top aide here, Navarro reported to federal prison in Miami this morning."
"5316820","5320020"," Before heading in, he said he was a victim of political persecution. "
"5320720","5322120"," That he was proud to serve his sentence."
"5322660","5326920"," The Supreme Court denied Navarro's last minute request to avoid prison while appealing his four"
"5326920","5330940"," month sentence for refusing to comply with the January 6th committee subpoena."
"5331660","5334320"," The EU's foreign policy chief said he's planning to. "
"5334360","5337060"," Hey, Bickey, can you send me a link to that video?"
"5337920","5338900"," I missed all of it."
"5339060","5339480"," All of it."
"5339560","5340040"," Interaction. "
"5340260","5341980"," Can you try to get me a link to that?"
"5342400","5342880"," Please."
"5343160","5348400"," Official said last week that those revenues could reach 20 billion euros through 2027."
"5349040","5354400"," And James Crumbly, the father just convicted of manslaughter for a 2021 Michigan school shooting"
"5354400","5359700"," committed by his son, allegedly said his goal in life was to ruin the prosecutor in the case"
"5359700","5360420"," against him. "
"5360420","5367080"," The Detroit Free Press first reported the comments came from jailhouse calls he made to his sister."
"5367360","5368300"," Courtney, back over to you."
"5368740","5369600"," Thank you very much, Julia. "
"5369860","5370440"," Appreciate that."
"5370800","5374560"," Well, coming up, the state of the consumer will tell you why Nordstrom is rallying today."
"5374800","5379080"," Plus, it's set up on 19 and Lulu Lemon ahead of earnings this week for both of those names. "
"5379440","5380540"," Half time is back in two."
"5568510","5572310"," As a dowels of the high of the session, check out Cheers of Nordstrom as well."
"5572490","5573670"," The stock soaring on a report. "
"5573670","5577730"," The retailer is trying to go private again and sticking with retail."
"5577930","5579610"," We have two key earnings on deck as well."
"5579610","5582850"," Nike and Lulu Lemon both reporting earnings Thursday after the bell. "
"5583030","5586710"," So all of this put together got us thinking, what is the state of the US consumer?"
"5586990","5591210"," Obviously something important for the Fed too to consider as they have their meeting this week."
"5591450","5594170"," Jim, I know you're not in Nike, but you were at one point."
"5594510","5594710"," Yeah. "
"5595250","5597310"," Well, Nike's a show me story right now."
"5597410","5599870"," I can't believe these words are going to come out of my mouth."
"5599870","5603310"," But there's a legitimate question as to the brand supremacy at Nike. "
"5603310","5603790"," Oh, wow."
"5604250","5604930"," No, I know."
"5605130","5608050"," That's like, and it's a question to be answered by the company. "
"5608450","5609690"," I don't know the answer, folks."
"5609870","5614590"," What I can tell you is at the September quarter, when they reported, excuse me, this was the August"
"5614590","5619110"," 31st quarter, they came through with better inventories, better margins, better pricing."
"5619370","5620730"," It looked like they were back on track. "
"5621290","5622210"," I got in the stock then."
"5622370","5623530"," It shot up 25 percent."
"5623530","5627570"," I don't know if you remember, but the analyst community was following all over themselves to raise"
"5627570","5628150"," price targets. "
"5628530","5628550"," Yeah."
"5628750","5632750"," Lo and behold, the November 30th quarter, they absolutely tanked it."
"5632750","5636530"," And then the stock went down, and now it's below 100 as we sit right now. "
"5637010","5638970"," The question hangs out there."
"5639210","5640670"," Has Nike lost its mojo?"
"5641050","5642610"," I'm not saying it has, folks."
"5642850","5647870"," I'm saying as an investor, who would love to be in the Nike of old that did have brand supremacy?"
"5648730","5653170"," I need that question answered by the company in their earnings report when it comes out this week"
"5653170","5654150"," before I'll take a position. "
"5654390","5654530"," Wow."
"5654930","5658330"," Josh, I imagine you probably have some thoughts on Nike and Lulu Lemon."
"5660710","5668850"," So it's true that the competitive pressure is coming from brands like on are out there, and it's,"
"5668950","5673530"," you know, it's obviously something that Nike has had to contend with its entire existence. "
"5673930","5674810"," There have always been challengers."
"5675810","5679850"," So I don't think that that's really going to have a huge impact on a go forward basis."
"5680650","5686030"," I think the trouble for Nike is just that it's so reliant on the global economy holding up and"
"5686030","5688110"," consumers in various parts of the world. "
"5688710","5695570"," Holding up and then here at home, it's got, you know, on the channel ambitions and, you know, they"
"5695570","5698310"," want to be more direct to consumer, which I think makes sense."
"5699050","5699810"," But it's harder."
"5700290","5700850"," It's more expensive. "
"5701370","5703930"," It's a bigger marketing challenge."
"5704450","5707610"," So, you know, if you're if you're up to the fight, stay long."
"5707710","5711110"," And if you want to do something easier, there are easier stories out there. "
"5711110","5715730"," Yeah, it is interesting what Nike's gone through with its DTC and wholesale pulled back a lot and"
"5715730","5718370"," now it's kind of dribbling back into wholesale and some of those accounts."
"5719070","5720530"," Shane, what do you when you put it all together?"
"5720910","5726770"," Are you worried about the US consumer when you have such strong brand household names like Nike and"
"5726770","5729550"," Lulu Lemon, or is that not really what we're asking here?"
"5730170","5730890"," I think it's broader."
"5731170","5735470"," I mean, I think you really need to differentiate between the, you know, stock specific company"
"5735470","5740170"," specific narrative and what we're seeing from a consumer perspective and really, you know, what you"
"5740170","5741030"," should be watching for. "
"5741030","5744110"," Is any sort of deterioration in middle income consumer spending."
"5744730","5749670"," And so high income consumers remain in range engaged middle income consumers for the most part,"
"5749670","5754170"," although their basket has shifted a little bit and potentially become a little less discretionary"
"5754170","5755350"," over the last few months."
"5755750","5758790"," They continue to spend and be very much engaged. "
"5759130","5763610"," And so lower income consumers, some challenges, obviously some geographic concerns and"

"5793710","5798630"," And then they turned out some pretty good results for the fourth quarter, nevertheless, but looking"

"6076060","6077100"," But I'm an old man. "
"6077240","6078020"," I hope it looked that good."
"6080060","6084260"," I'm squeezing up hard now to where the old Jim bros are at the top end."
"6085300","6088880"," I'm going to assume that there's panic from the young Jim bros. "

"6125240","6129500"," You know they like to sneak in here and send it down to the depths of hell down here."
"6129640","6130160"," We can go higher. "
"6130520","6134240"," Just remember that they go up here and they sell it down and go up here and they sell it"
"6134240","6134560"," down."
"6135300","6136780"," Go up there and they sell it down."

"6186000","6187480"," A little bit lower lows, lower lows."
"6188020","6193060"," And even if we were to squeeze up, even if we squeeze up here, we get a new high 5200"
"6193060","6194160"," and then we come down."
"6195700","6203860"," You know, there's like this part right here where you just like, eh, let me explain that better for"
"6203860","6204060"," you. "
"6206060","6207220"," The trigger screen."
"6207960","6210060"," So we got the young Jim bros down here."
"6210160","6212080"," We got the full squeeze going on right now. "
"6212400","6213600"," Turn to the scene of the crime."
"6216820","6221260"," What I would say to you here would be when we have a trade like this."
"6221720","6223020"," See how beautiful that is?"
"6223600","6224940"," You have this major squeeze. "
"6225720","6229840"," I always tell you guys, we get these big squeezes off of the hourly trigger."
"6230040","6230600"," What do I tell you?"
"6231120","6234600"," Same shit that I tell the bears, which they don't want to believe me either."
"6236640","6238220"," Well, all that shit comes back. "
"6241120","6242240"," And then we go up again."
"6244060","6245380"," Just be aware of that."
"6245460","6245640"," Okay. "
"6246040","6247460"," Even if we're going to continue higher."
"6249220","6251060"," All that shit always comes back."
"6251520","6251760"," Okay. "
"6251920","6254780"," Especially when it's straight up, like boom."
"6255840","6257000"," So just be aware of it."
"6257160","6259060"," If you're a bear, you know what's up, right?"
"6259980","6261100"," And you can see it right now. "
"6261200","6264120"," It's a little bit of, it's a little bit of selling there."
"6264720","6266220"," Doesn't mean we don't squeeze above either."
"6266300","6269780"," It just means even if we squeeze, even if we squeeze above right now, boom right there. "
"6270520","6271540"," Still going to come back."
"6271920","6273960"," We're going to test this 5 minute trigger over here."
"6275000","6275940"," And every time. "
"6276300","6279100"," Don't be like the fucking Kool-Aid drinking bears."
"6280500","6282680"," It's going straight down cap, but it's never coming back."
"6283040","6284220"," No, no, no, it always comes back. "
"6284660","6286260"," So just be aware of it as we get up here."
"6287460","6293580"," It's now 12.47. There is a bond auction at 1 p.m. Next 13 minutes or so."
"6296000","6297600"," Congratulations if you made a bunch of money. "
"6300060","6301540"," Super congrats to you out there."
"6305840","6308840"," You didn't have a Sunday night for Monday tassel update."
"6309120","6310420"," If I have to go find it, I'll be upset. "
"6312220","6313880"," Let me find out."
"6314080","6315800"," I think it was done Sunday for Monday."
"6317000","6317860"," You could be right. "
"6318020","6318480"," I might be wrong."
"6320500","6321420"," You could be right."
"6321560","6322100"," I might be wrong. "
"6323800","6327000"," I swore I posted it on the Sunday for Monday."
"6328100","6330100"," So you don't get Mondays on Monday."
"6330100","6334160"," You get Sunday for Monday and then you get Wednesday and Friday. "
"6334360","6336180"," Maybe it should be more clear on that."
"6339600","6340680"," I will check though."
"6340820","6342680"," If I didn't, I will check. "
"6344080","6345020"," And I will get you one."
"6345220","6347140"," Do you want me to do one right now just to just get it out of the way?"
"6347840","6349200"," I feel like I can ask these questions."
"6349520","6350660"," Then I'm like go back and I'm like these. "
"6351120","6351780"," They're lying to me."
"6352580","6353740"," They're lying to me again."
"6355780","6361100"," Yeah, tassel is on Sunday because of it's because it's Sunday. "
"6362220","6363320"," Coming into Monday."
"6364480","6366400"," You get it Sunday for Monday."
"6367260","6367720"," All right. "
"6368820","6370020"," It has a freaking me out."
"6370240","6371320"," You guys want it today though."
"6371520","6371900"," How about this?"
"6372820","6373300"," I'll get you. "
"6373900","6375460"," I'll get it done for you today."
"6375780","6376260"," Hold on a second."
"6377080","6377960"," We'll do one today. "
"6383720","6384940"," Give me one quick second."
"6385580","6386660"," I'll write a note."
"6387000","6389260"," I'll have tassel done again for today for you. "
"6422230","6439090"," All right."
"6439330","6448770"," So at some point today, if you are a supporter or hire, I'm going to give you an update for"
"6448770","6454330"," tessel that is on an hourly basis and a daily basis."
"6455410","6456510"," I'm not going to give you the four hour. "
"6456510","6460010"," I don't think, but I'm going to give you the one hour in the daily basis."
"6460910","6464670"," So you'll have an update today for tessel."
"6465390","6469030"," That's both supporter and pro trader so that everybody's on the same page with tessel. "
"6471370","6475250"," Bond auction one PM be aware of it starts at nine minutes."
"6476050","6476730"," Nine minutes."
"6476850","6479990"," I'm going to put on the squacker right now for that auction. "
"6490190","6491090"," We'll get that going."
"6495270","6497290"," We'll listen into the auction results."
"6505660","6512040"," While that's going on, we're going to play the this whole area of GTC financial analysts or the"
"6512040","6512740"," GCC. "
"6513740","6518160"," You know, the type of systems that we're going to see in the next several years, a couple of two,"
"6518320","6521080"," three years is unimaginable compared to today."
"6522800","6524020"," For the reasons I described."
"6525700","6526760"," You're in video. "
"6527840","6529300"," Bonus chart from last night."
"6529440","6531160"," How's that working out for you this morning?"
"6531160","6532080"," Let me know in the chat."
"6532400","6535080"," Did anybody read the NVIDIA bonus chart last night?"
"6535160","6535920"," Synthetic data generation. "
"6536960","6538000"," Anybody out there?"
"6538080","6539580"," Other reinforcement learning."
"6540480","6544300"," Any of you read the NVIDIA post from yesterday?"
"6545400","6547420"," Today we have one computer training on data."
"6547680","6548800"," Tomorrow it's going to be two computers. "
"6549480","6550080"," That's right."
"6550280","6551580"," Say it loud, Addie."
"6552700","6553360"," It's multiple. "
"6553820","6554960"," Did I draw with crayons?"
"6555340","6556420"," Goddamn right I did."
"6557020","6560100"," Okay, so that we could do that as quickly as possible."
"6562160","6564540"," Some really exciting groundbreaking work around the corner. "
"6566100","6572400"," The one thing we're certain is that the scale of these, the scale of our GPUs, they want to be"
"6572400","6572860"," even bigger."
"6574240","6576040"," The 30s, the 30s of our company."
"6577780","6579720"," NVIDIA's 30s are absolutely the world's best. "
"6580880","6582920"," The data rate and the energy consumed."
"6583320","6586620"," The data rate, you know, the Pecal Jule per bit."
"6587000","6589000"," Yeah, I'm throwing up here in the background. "
"6589500","6590480"," But I'm not here."
"6590660","6591120"," I'm throwing up."
"6591300","6592920"," It's the reason why we were able to do MVLink. "
"6593280","6596860"," Remember, MVLink was because we could not make a chip big enough."
"6597440","6598680"," And so we connected eight of them together."
"6599900","6601460"," This was in 2016. "
"6602500","6612480"," We're on NVDA, ripping faces off from a low this morning of 8.55, 8.53. Now trading $50 higher"
"6612480","6617320"," at 8.93 chips, and expecting a sell at 900."
"6617460","6618760"," They are together as far as I'm concerned."
"6619680","6622680"," Sell at 900 is what I'm actually expecting right here. "
"6622840","6623360"," Is it close together?"
"6623520","6623780"," A little bit lower."
"6625160","6625740"," No."
"6625740","6627700"," So we're close to there right now, just so you know. "
"6627840","6628320"," Six ways."
"6630160","6633000"," And the 30s are so low energy anyways."
"6633580","6634920"," I love you guys out there. "
"6635020","6635740"," I love you too, Addy."
"6635780","6637940"," We could make even closer chips."
"6638000","6639380"," Am I taking shorts here?"
"6639980","6640760"," Let's take a look. "
"6641000","6641360"," I'll take a look."
"6641500","6642180"," I might take one with you."
"6642260","6642400"," Hold on. "
"6643840","6647300"," You know, when you break up chips, you know, the goal."
"6647520","6651320"," What I don't like is that this GTC hasn't ended yet."
"6652080","6652920"," I'll say that. "
"6652920","6655760"," I don't like that the GTC hasn't ended yet."
"6655800","6656760"," I'd really like to see this chip."
"6656880","6657820"," The Q&A just stopped. "
"6658040","6658700"," To do so."
"6658880","6659360"," Seriously."
"6659900","6661320"," Start by building the largest chip ever. "
"6661760","6666020"," Otherwise, why don't we do multi chip back in the old days?"
"6666760","6668640"," We just kept pushing right."
"6668920","6669800"," Mallolithic as far as."
"6669900","6670620"," And the reason for that. "
"6670980","6674500"," HYG just fucking ripped faces off this morning."
"6675160","6681400"," Allows for the programming mix now trading $14.09. Gaking out."
"6681600","6682520"," What do you guys want?"
"6682680","6684140"," Some like 17 C's. "
"6684620","6685800"," So you don't have a newma behavior."
"6686220","6687260"," You don't have weird cache behavior."
"6687540","6688220"," You don't have VIX. "
"6688460","6691440"," You guys look at it at 17 C."
"6691700","6694340"," Depending on the nodes that the systems they run on."
"6694620","6697460"," We want our software to run exactly the same wherever they are."
"6699040","6700980"," And SMLR turning around to the upside. "
"6701740","6702660"," The first black wall die."
"6703000","6703960"," We connect the two of them together."
"6704000","6706820"," The technology 10 terabytes per second is insane. "
"6708040","6709160"," Hold on a second."
"6709200","6710180"," Hold on a second here."
"6711020","6712440"," That's 10 terabytes per second. "
"6712540","6712980"," Scratch that."
"6713220","6714820"," Scratch that I'm saying that I'll mix right now."
"6715020","6719860"," Yeah, VIX is at 14.05. And so we VIX starting to turn around here. "
"6720260","6721600"," Consolidating, holding it solid."
"6722260","6724920"," Like the buy ball crowd is like fuck you."
"6725140","6726320"," We're buying ball here. "
"6726680","6729300"," We don't care where price is going."
"6729740","6731540"," You know, because the first generation co-host was all."
"6731760","6734200"," SMLR looking extremely bullish right now. "
"6734400","6735040"," Extremely bullish."
"6735040","6737000"," That we have is on SMLR."
"6737700","6740020"," The volume ramp demand. "
"6740500","6743080"," Now's deck breaking 18,000 baby."
"6743360","6745780"," We've had plenty of visibility."
"6746100","6747920"," And so Cola is absolutely right. "
"6747960","6750140"," Oh, Jim bro is getting scared right now."
"6750260","6751720"," Their panties are in a bunch at home."
"6752400","6753520"," TSMC very closely. "
"6754160","6758560"," We are geared up for an exciting ramp."
"6762890","6765430"," And this is, I'm going to say one thing to you."
"6766050","6767850"," Let's look at a trade here really quickly. "
"6768010","6769230"," Where we are right now."
"6770270","6770790"," Bummer."
"6771070","6771330"," Wow. "
"6771710","6772110"," Thank you."
"6772230","6774590"," Aaron Rakers at Wells Fargo."
"6774950","6776370"," I really appreciate all this detail. "
"6776810","6781610"," I'm actually going to dovetail off this last comment because today you started the conversation by"
"6781610","6785010"," talking a little bit about Ethernet and how Ethernet with Ultra."
"6785310","6786010"," I love Ethernet."
"6786430","6786630"," Yeah. "
"6786910","6789150"," So I want to understand."
"6789390","6790050"," I love Ethernet."
"6790810","6791490"," Envy link. "
"6792130","6795210"," 576 GPUs now interconnected together."
"6796050","6797370"," This idea of the fabric architecture."
"6797830","6801790"," Where does that play relative to the evolution of Ethernet?"
"6802230","6803530"," Your spectrum for product. "
"6803930","6805050"," This moved to 800 gig."
"6805190","6805330"," I'm just."
"6805390","6807830"," Five hundred P's for Friday. "
"6808490","6810170"," Five hundred P with Ethernet."
"6810750","6811430"," You're a bear."
"6811950","6813310"," Five hundred P's for Friday. "
"6813830","6814690"," Twenty cents."
"6815150","6816510"," The algorithm is actually very simple."
"6816730","6819070"," First there's 16 cents right now. "
"6819530","6820350"," Possibly can."
"6820450","6821570"," Should we look at Monday maybe?"
"6822730","6826810"," So big that if you added one more transistor it would literally fall on the ground."
"6828230","6829810"," That's algorithm number one. "
"6829990","6831230"," And look at the chips that we built there."
"6831330","6832650"," Twenty eight cents."
"6834450","6836650"," For five hundred P for Monday. "
"6837370","6838090"," If possible."
"6838410","6839690"," Get another chance right now."
"6839830","6841490"," You're not going to connect four of them together. "
"6841710","6842290"," That's not going to happen."
"6843910","6845670"," But if you can connect two of them together."
"6845930","6847030"," That's the Blackwell invention. "
"6847750","6850250"," We now know how to build guys that big."
"6850430","6853110"," I mean you guys have you guys you got a chance right here."
"6853110","6854550"," I have all kinds of weird new my effects. "
"6854790","6855470"," Monday puts."
"6856630","6858090"," You might as well go to envy link."
"6858230","6859010"," Twenty eight cents. "
"6859570","6860390"," Five hundred P."
"6860630","6861730"," Once you get to envy link."
"6862270","6863130"," The question is."
"6863330","6864930"," You're on Twitter all day long. "
"6864930","6866950"," You're talking about all this shit that's coming."
"6867550","6867950"," Okay."
"6868610","6869090"," You can. "
"6869130","6869530"," Where is that?"
"6869730","6870170"," It's like this."
"6870350","6874490"," But if you have envy link then the next part is build envy link as large as you can."
"6876850","6878110"," Modulated by power and cost. "
"6878330","6878890"," Five hundred P."
"6879050","6881490"," We're training by fifteen right now."
"6881930","6882670"," Direct connect."
"6882910","6884730"," This is your last chance. "
"6884870","6886470"," Not because not this is it."
"6886770","6887270"," Optical transfer."
"6887490","6887890"," Your fair. "
"6888430","6889890"," So you got man."
"6890170","6891290"," Ball rolls off tomorrow."
"6891970","6893310"," You only got one. "
"6893450","6894730"," You only got one perfect chance."
"6894970","6895550"," This is it."
"6895670","6896350"," You got it. "
"6896470","6896790"," Right here."
"6897490","6898150"," Because you can."
"6898250","6901750"," You're a bear out there. "
"6902110","6903510"," Now I'll post it on Twitter."
"6904010","6905170"," Five hundred seventy six."
"6905290","6906890"," Oh I never posted the live stream shit. "
"6907510","6907950"," Oopsie."
"6908750","6911330"," But that's only five hundred seventy six GPU chips."
"6911630","6912130"," That's not very. "
"6912330","6912830"," That's not enough."
"6913330","6915410"," And so we're going to have to connect multiple of them."
"6915670","6917370"," The next click after that the best. "
"6917790","6920410"," You're a bear last chance for buying some ball."
"6921090","6927070"," The second best you have is ethernet with an augmented computing layer on top of it."
"6927290","6928210"," We call spectrum X."
"6929250","6932710"," We can control the traffic that's that's in the system. "
"6932710","6935050"," So that we don't have these long tails."
"6936230","6941310"," Remember as I said the last one to finish determines the speed of the computer."
"6941950","6943290"," This is not an average throughput. "
"6943590","6948050"," This is not like like all of us individually are accessing hyperscale."
"6948090","6950490"," And our average throughput is good enough."
"6950910","6955550"," This is literally the last person who finishes that partial product. "
"6956050","6957290"," Who finishes that tensor."
"6957890","6959450"," Everybody else is waiting on them."
"6959450","6960570"," I'm shortly expecting the results. "
"6960850","6961990"," The twenty year bond auction."
"6962270","6963350"," I don't know who it is in this room."
"6963450","6964070"," That's going to be the last. "
"6964270","6966470"," But treasury when a studio comes after the top."
"6966530","6968410"," We're going to hope that that person doesn't hold up right."
"6968810","6973370"," And so we're going to make sure that that that last one is we push everything to the middle. "
"6974130","6975410"," We only want one answer."
"6975530","6977490"," It all shows up at the right time."
"6978170","6978510"," Okay. "
"6978750","6981190"," And so so that that's the second best."
"6982090","6984170"," And then you scale that out as much as you can."
"6984850","6988370"," And that's going to need optics and you know so and so forth. "
"6990580","6991880"," There's a place for all of it."
"6992040","6993100"," There's a place for all of it."
"6993240","6995920"," I think if anybody's concerned about optics, don't be concerned. "
"6996460","6999900"," I think the demand for optics is very, very high."
"7000860","7002680"," Demand for repeaters is very, very high."
"7004100","7005120"," We didn't change anything about that. "
"7005400","7007100"," All we did was we made computers a larger."
"7007680","7008480"," We made GPUs larger."
"7013140","7014140"," Can we take one more question?"
"7015420","7016480"," This is so much fun. "
"7020040","7024400"," Treasury, when issued 20 year yield for spot 562% before the first."
"7024400","7026700"," Last question from the by side, Jensen."
"7027520","7029240"," You've talked a lot about Saab. "
"7029780","7030320"," Oh, I'm sorry."
"7030740","7032000"," Oh, there he is."
"7032160","7033360"," Hey, I will. "
"7033620","7034980"," You know, Sovereign AI."
"7035640","7040920"," Is there a way to sort of understand like what you're going to do for, you know, the United Arab"
"7040920","7041260"," Emirates?"
"7042080","7043600"," That would be, you know, one question."
"7043880","7046280"," And I guess my second question is like, I'm going to go home. "
"7046340","7048020"," I'm going to see my 91 year old mother."
"7049340","7055000"," Like, how can I try to explain to the same 91 year old, you know, what accelerated computing?"
"7055740","7057340"," I guess I've got a good answer."
"7057980","7059440"," The first question, I'll figure out the second one. "
"7059640","7059780"," Okay."
"7060520","7060700"," Yeah."
"7060760","7065120"," I don't know what you're going to say on the second one, but on the second one, I would say"
"7065120","7066620"," use the right tools for the right job. "
"7067300","7067700"," Yeah."
"7068500","7073660"," And right now, general purpose computing, you're using the same tool for every single job."
"7075000","7080640"," Literally, literally what you have is a screwdriver and you're using it from the moment you woke up"
"7080640","7081860"," to the moment you go to bed. "
"7082520","7085300"," And so you start with brushing your teeth with a screwdriver."
"7086020","7086980"," It probably works."
"7088940","7090460"," I haven't tried it, but it probably works. "
"7091000","7093500"," And so you just use that one tool the whole day."
"7094020","7098120"," Now, of course, because you're going to use that one tool for the whole day, over time humans have"
"7098120","7098880"," gotten pretty smart."
"7099220","7099960"," And so we made that joke. "
"7099960","7100940"," Just be careful."
"7101240","7106260"," You see how this market is just like the whole market is disappearing right now for this event."
"7106260","7107960"," It becomes useful for all kinds of stuff. "
"7108460","7111020"," And you could also use it to clean the bathroom and all that kind of stuff."
"7111500","7112260"," And so one tool."
"7114400","7115380"," Was that the answer?"
"7115520","7118600"," It's a two week bill high yield of 4.81% forecast. "
"7119480","7122520"," Previous was 4.69%. The CPU."
"7122700","7124360"," None of this is bad, by the way."
"7124560","7125040"," This is all good. "
"7125040","7126660"," The bond auction was good for bulls."
"7126880","7127340"," You want to know?"
"7127540","7128240"," The terrible things."
"7129940","7131200"," The bond auction was good. "
"7131760","7137680"," The US 20-year bid to cover 2.79. Previous 2.39. Fucking hand in the market, dude."
"7137880","7139640"," He's fucking, I'll tell you fucking what, dude."
"7139840","7140420"," Except for graphics. "
"7140720","7141640"," He's fucking..."
"7146300","7146740"," Fucking..."
"7146740","7148240"," Anti-fucking yelling is like..."
"7148240","7151320"," Anti-fucking yelling is like, Japan's doing what?"
"7151320","7153340"," And fuck you right now."
"7153360","7154800"," I'm showing up to the auction today."
"7156620","7157700"," Oh yeah, it's an A plus. "
"7158060","7159400"," It was an A fucking plus, we want to know."
"7159560","7162160"," I haven't seen what Andy said, but it was great."
"7163420","7168960"," Old Yellen came in and said, fuck you and your fucking Japan doom. "
"7170820","7171860"," It's my market."
"7173440","7176060"," And we said, we said, haha, look at that."
"7176500","7176900"," How interesting. "
"7176900","7178060"," Why don't we..."
"7179180","7180460"," That's insanely good."
"7180880","7181460"," At 1%."
"7181460","7183220"," Ah, it sucks to be a bear. "
"7183540","7184900"," 9% of the fucking..."
"7184900","7188200"," They totally fucking scam in this whole fucking market, dude."
"7188420","7188520"," Good."
"7188700","7189580"," At 1% of the code. "
"7191700","7192720"," And we just go..."
"7192720","7194680"," We go create applications or find..."
"7194680","7196160"," I need like a Yellen socket."
"7197580","7198360"," Hold on a second."
"7198740","7199840"," See if I can do this in the background. "
"7200300","7200660"," Hold on here."
"7203140","7204020"," Artificial intelligence."
"7205100","7205460"," Makes sense?"
"7207520","7208360"," Hold on here. "
"7208360","7210100"," That's why it's already computing data processing."
"7211300","7212020"," So on and so forth."
"7212880","7215700"," Where 1% of the code is 99% of the runtime. "
"7216260","7218000"," And that's the reason why we get such great speed up."
"7218780","7219420"," All right."
"7221680","7222120"," Your..."
"7222120","7222680"," Sovereign AI. "
"7222840","7223200"," Sovereign AI."
"7223900","7230420"," Every country has their own own natural resources called their intelligence."
"7231260","7231860"," It's in their language. "
"7232260","7233100"," You know, India."
"7233100","7234220"," Oh man, dude."
"7234440","7236660"," It's not easy being a bear right now. "
"7236980","7237380"," Language."
"7237700","7241760"," It was so much better when, like, the Fed in the Treasury Department was on the team bear."
"7242260","7243240"," It was so much easier. "
"7243680","7246260"," It was like bulls coming in being like, oh, this is going to happen."
"7246420","7247020"," That's going to happen."
"7247400","7247960"," Digitize us. "
"7248100","7250060"," It belongs to..."
"7250060","7251120"," Jerome would shit down your neck."
"7251540","7253460"," You could create their own sovereign AI."
"7254140","7256100"," And rip your head off, shit down your neck as a bull. "
"7257020","7258320"," Discard you to the side of the road."
"7258980","7259460"," Yeah."
"7260080","7260560"," Yeah. "
"7260820","7261400"," You name it."
"7261920","7266080"," Companies, countries all over the world realize that this is their natural..."
"7266080","7266960"," their natural resource."
"7267860","7268940"," And they shouldn't let it..."
"7268940","7271280"," Bears do, like, they're just waiting for it again. "
"7272380","7275040"," Their natural resource back to them in an automated way."
"7275380","7276860"," Now you got, like, on the top rope."
"7277200","7278980"," You're yelling coming out from the top rope. "
"7279480","7279680"," For free."
"7280080","7281440"," And import..."
"7282040","7282520"," AI."
"7283360","7285280"," They now realize it ought to be the other way around. "
"7285280","7288260"," That they should keep their own data and then export AI."
"7289140","7291040"," And so export the AI of Korea."
"7291380","7294860"," Export the AI of Malaysia. "
"7296120","7299620"," Export the AI of, you name it, Middle East countries."
"7300380","7302280"," And so we will..."
"7303500","7306600"," We have export control limitations on our products."
"7308100","7312620"," And in most of the areas, the answer is it's not export control. "
"7312620","7319120"," And if there's any export control, we can still work with the US government and make sure that the"
"7319120","7320420"," export is going to be fine."
"7320620","7320960"," But we..."
"7320960","7323300"," Number one, just make sure that we're compliant with export control."
"7324360","7331140"," And in some countries, we have to offer degraded products or, you know, I didn't say that right. "
"7331320","7332400"," With lower specification products."
"7337160","7337960"," And I..."
"7337960","7344920"," But anyways, number one, just be compliant with export controls and help countries around the world"
"7344920","7345660"," to be able to do this."
"7346740","7347820"," It's a very big market. "
"7348120","7349000"," Hold on, I'll pull this out."
"7349540","7356720"," There are going to be AI's that are going to be trained and continuously refined for just about"
"7356720","7357560"," every culture in the world."
"7358740","7358840"," Yeah. "
"7360200","7360820"," Thank you."
"7361640","7363360"," Do you guys know?"
"7363840","7364300"," No."
"7365920","7367840"," Thank you very, very much. "
"7369500","7370700"," I appreciate..."
"7370700","7373180"," Collette and I appreciate..."
"7373180","7377760"," Collette and I appreciate all of your support and interest in the company."
"7377980","7381440"," And this is really quite an extraordinary time."
"7381660","7389280"," It is not unusual that we get to live through a time like this where the single most important"
"7389280","7392840"," instrument of society is being reinvented after 60 years. "
"7393720","7396580"," That a new way of doing software has emerged."
"7396860","7401360"," And you know that software is one of the most important technologies that humanity has ever"
"7401360","7401680"," created."
"7403160","7406320"," And that you're in the beginning of a new industrial revolution. "
"7406880","7409740"," And so the next 10 years, you definitely don't want to miss."
"7410120","7410360"," All right."
"7410580","7411040"," Thank you very much. "
"7411620","7412060"," Wow."
"7412220","7412820"," That was pretty big."
"7413140","7414640"," That's a good end right here. "
"7414840","7415560"," So just a note."
"7415700","7418120"," I said to be good to get put after they finish."
"7419100","7420720"," The GTC friend video. "
"7420720","7421960"," They did just finish."
"7423360","7425080"," So be aware of that."
"7425880","7427720"," And he did say something important. "
"7428000","7434080"," He said he did say you're at the start of a 10 year revolution."
"7434860","7440460"," A new industrial revolution with AI."
"7440960","7442320"," I am in agreement with that. "
"7443960","7445400"," Robotics isn't there yet."
"7445700","7446380"," And it won't be there."
"7446480","7449080"," I don't think for a long period of time, let's have a major breakthrough. "
"7449820","7453540"," But at least from the software computing side, I agree with that."
"7455040","7456180"," Be careful here."
"7457080","7458700"," We had the bond auction was a plus. "
"7458940","7461740"," We also note that even though we didn't get blasted down."
"7462620","7470140"," That this is probably the place the last chance for bears to buy some ball, buy some puts, whatever"
"7470140","7470880"," it is they're going to do."
"7471520","7475380"," There are some really cheap puts for tomorrow and Monday. "
"7475560","7477180"," I know that you guys out there."
"7478500","7480340"," Piss a lot of money away."
"7480800","7482620"," 16 cent puts for 500. "
"7483400","7486140"," For Friday is dirt cheap cost of doing business."
"7487160","7488960"," That's all it is cost of doing business."
"7489560","7494320"," Then you also have 28 cent or 26 cent puts for Monday. "
"7494960","7498680"," I think there are 500 P's for both that I'm listening to you right now."
"7498680","7505460"," If you want to put some hedging onto the market for tomorrow's rate decision and feel comfortable"
"7505460","7513480"," like you've got something, what I would say to you would be there is a risk of selling the news"
"7513480","7515540"," on the event before we get there."
"7515640","7522120"," So if you see a role that takes place from now into tomorrow, you can either be taking the money"
"7522120","7525260"," and running that right before we get into the event or taking the money and running. "
"7525720","7533160"," If you get that one fast down move, take the money, monetize and then even if we continue to roll"
"7533160","7535660"," down later, we get a rate hike or some shit like that."
"7536740","7537660"," That's not the trade."
"7537960","7541280"," This trade right now is not the trade for doom. "
"7542000","7544580"," This is a trade for buying ball into an event."
"7545280","7547240"," You take the money and run before you ever get there."
"7547980","7550420"," You don't diamond hand like a monster. "
"7551060","7554300"," Get all crazy worked up my stream inside the chat."
"7555180","7556080"," Chase winter."
"7562580","7563500"," You're breaking. "
"7563820","7566600"," You're going to come back down and try to test the five minute trigger."
"7566600","7576180"," If you want to be more tactful with buying puts here or buying ball, you are looking for"
"7576180","7582240"," price to get underneath the five minute trigger."
"7583360","7583700"," Right. "
"7585220","7594460"," Get underneath the hourly trigger and then be looking for a new low right here to actually take"
"7594460","7594880"," that trade."
"7594880","7599140"," You need all that stair casing down to get more bearish."
"7601760","7608240"," If you want to know what I expect to happen here tomorrow, I expect to get out into tomorrow. "
"7608500","7609580"," I'm bearish here."
"7610800","7614620"," I am bearish."
"7616360","7622860"," I do think that whatever the event is listening to me closely here, I do think that whatever"
"7622860","7632420"," happens tomorrow is going to be the catalyst for the catalyst for a seasonal low for the market to"
"7632420","7632720"," buy. "
"7633660","7638880"," So if you want to hold me to something, I think that you're going to get a bloodbath."
"7640140","7643000"," I don't I don't care what they assigned the news to it on."
"7643760","7650580"," I don't care what the reasoning is. "
"7650580","7653740"," I don't care if it's the fed speak for whatever happens."
"7653740","7661200"," I don't care what the fuck it is, but I'm assuming here that you're still be a catalyst for a"
"7661200","7665720"," seasonal low coming out of the fed meeting tomorrow."
"7667080","7667740"," Another note. "
"7667940","7669280"," I'm going to do one other thing for you here."
"7669460","7673580"," I'm getting sick again feeling it again right now."
"7673580","7679080"," Give me like five minutes and I'm going to talk to you about another trade that I haven't talked"
"7679080","7681920"," with you about a meeting to and haven't had the time to talk to you about. "
"7681920","7682780"," Give me just a few minutes."
"7683100","7684300"," I'm going to talk to you one more trade."
"7684500","7684620"," Okay. "
"7685440","7686420"," One more trade here."
"7857130","7862230"," Aren't they just really haven't been performing well, especially when they're interest rate"
"7862230","7862630"," concerns."
"7864110","7866510"," Well, what's going on their trader podcast?"
"7867170","7867770"," What's going on?"
"7867930","7869370"," You big doggy out there. "
"7869590","7870630"," They're just not."
"7870850","7871790"," How are you doing, brother?"
"7872010","7873330"," Emerging technology."
"7874130","7875510"," Good to see you. "
"7875710","7876990"," Maybe a little bit more overlooked."
"7877250","7878330"," I love your trader podcast."
"7878830","7881370"," The way it's going. "
"7881730","7888390"," And if the Fed has what I'm doing, the economy is doing this well, that typically is a good"
"7888390","7889750"," environment for small cap."
"7889750","7895390"," And we think that small cap course, small cap growth side would be a little better for that because"
"7895390","7899230"," we are a little concerned about small value and their exposure to community."
"7899750","7902710"," So I got we so we got the one trade, right?"
"7903710","7906010"," So we got the one trade. "
"7906290","7907590"," We finished one trade."
"7907810","7909750"," Now we're looking at a downside trade."
"7912090","7913350"," Oh, yeah, dude. "
"7913790","7915050"," Good job trader podcast."
"7915390","7917210"," We posted that trade last night, brother."
"7919150","7920230"," So you got. "
"7920410","7925970"," So now we're now we're working on the last ball trade for the bears, but I got another trade for"
"7925970","7926230"," you."
"7926390","7926830"," We got up."
"7927010","7927750"," We got to like post. "
"7928470","7932130"," We have like a post op X post of expiration trade."
"7932130","7935150"," Give me a few minutes on it and I'll be right back with you guys."
"8057230","8059090"," Sorry, this looks so horrible. "
"8060010","8062750"," It's not doesn't really look good, does it?"
"8064430","8066870"," You know the drill if you're a bear, right?"
"8069010","8072210"," Dry and dry and dry and step it down, right?"
"8072450","8078030"," Place it right underneath the hourly trigger on the clothes on on tomorrow, right?"
"8078890","8080870"," Just like, you know, the bullshit, right?"
"8081090","8084950"," Come on down, come on down week, week, week, blast down here, right?"
"8085370","8087690"," Ooh, scaring us down in the clothes tomorrow."
"8088990","8090690"," I'm sure that you guys already know the trade."
"8090910","8092170"," You don't need me to show it to you. "
"8093250","8095270"," You know, it's some kind of nonsense like this."
"8097470","8098490"," Some kind of diarrhea."
"8101690","8103050"," See, you guys see it, right?"
"8103210","8104770"," I don't need to leave this diary up here. "
"8104770","8108230"," I hate having to draw this out for the bears because we already know it's going to go."
"8109330","8113470"," I'm going to delete it right for right now, but you guys get the gist, right?"
"8116610","8118350"," It's terrible even saying that."
"8122070","8126180"," You know, pin the, pin the bears in. "
"8130040","8131200"," All right, give me a minute."
"8131240","8132820"," I'm still working on this dragon in a few minutes."
"8132820","8142320"," Oh, one other thing down here too. "
"8144900","8146700"," Uh, bottom right."
"8148320","8149360"," So, NVDA."
"8150440","8151860"," One other thing down here. "
"8154300","8156880"," Be very conscious down here."
"8157320","8159580"," So, I've got a, I've got us rolling over and down."
"8159720","8160040"," It's tomorrow. "
"8160320","8162400"," I've got us selling 900."
"8162940","8163800"," Salva news on 900."
"8164440","8165800"," Now, I've got to tell you guys something. "
"8166360","8168620"," Uh, this is a one hour chart right here."
"8168680","8170260"," I got this up right for a down move."
"8170720","8171680"," I want you to know something. "
"8173200","8179160"," You know, if they buy this shit down here, if we go, if we do anything like this, or we"
"8179160","8182880"," come down here and check that, check that hourly trigger."
"8183540","8189140"," And if we get a new high right there, okay, new hot, get out of the way, because that shit's"
"8189140","8189740"," going to go moon."
"8191660","8193700"," So, I want you to pay attention to that, okay?"
"8194280","8196420"," So, we're going to come back down here and check. "
"8198480","8201379"," Come back down here and check this hourly trigger right here, okay?"
"8202959","8203840"," You understand what I'm saying?"
"8203980","8204600"," It's NVDA."
"8204959","8206500"," We'll come back down here and check that hourly trigger."
"8206860","8213260"," If that hourly trigger holds, and we go up for a new high, it's going to come back down, and"
"8213260","8214180"," it's going to do this. "
"8214580","8214980"," It's going to go."
"8216860","8217879"," It'll come back up."
"8218219","8219280"," You're going to come back down. "
"8219559","8227600"," And if this holds, and you catch that new high, watch out, because this will be a precursor to NVDA"
"8227600","8229959"," just blasting, like fucking blasting."
"8231700","8239219"," So, just be aware of that, even though I have us breaking through, you guys got projections from"
"8239219","8240680"," either always in advance, right?"
"8242840","8244540"," You got the target right here."
"8244740","8246639"," We're a little bit lower than we should be. "
"8246639","8247680"," I think I said 900."
"8248660","8250840"," But then I've got us going down here, right?"
"8251559","8252340"," To 850."
"8255160","8259500"," So, just be aware of that trade right there. "
"8260000","8261719"," But remember, we use the triggers, right?"
"8262080","8265180"," So, if the triggers are sitting here, this is the same as this morning for the bears."
"8266040","8269520"," On the flip side of this trade, I said to bulls this morning, right?"
"8269760","8270959"," We know where the bears are."
"8271459","8272219"," They're on the hourly trigger. "
"8272540","8273719"," We beat the bears in the hourly trigger."
"8273719","8276980"," We're going to go to the upside and complete the rest of that trade."
"8277219","8278299"," Same thing happens down here. "
"8278860","8279480"," Come down here."
"8279879","8286920"," If they get beyond this right here, we will see that 500, sorry for that 500, 850 down below here"
"8286920","8288219"," on NVDA."
"8288719","8289520"," Just be aware of it. "
"8289860","8299400"," Be aware of the hourly trigger, hourly trigger on NVDA currently sits at 879, 89, and"
"8299400","8300959"," 878, 58."
"8300959","8308260"," Remember, every squeeze, especially a big one, off of an hourly trigger, not every, but like 90%,"
"8308260","8312440"," come back to retest that trade for continuation to the upside."
"8312879","8317760"," They won't just continue higher, and you're seeing that pullback right now, checking down below in"
"8317760","8319000"," the hour and half hour trigger. "
"8319719","8320379"," Just be aware of it."
"8321059","8326059"," Note that people are going to put the hedge on for tomorrow for doom and gloom."
"8326260","8327379"," They get one more chance at it. "
"8339570","8340350"," It was a beautiful trade."
"8340530","8342030"," That NVDA trade was a gorgeous trade."
"8342330","8343209"," Absolutely stunning. "
"8344150","8350070"," The switching costs so high, which does not bode well for competitors that are in the market, which"
"8350070","8355090"," is why you saw the negative reaction in AMD stock price, just because you did have NVDA not only"
"8355090","8359809"," with the GPUs, but also the CUDA software that's used by a lot of developers."
"8360129","8365610"," And now this entire package, you know, with prebuilt AI models that they're offering, the license"
"8365610","8368690"," that we just talked about at $4,500 per year per GPU."
"8368690","8373150"," So that adds up and makes it even more difficult for companies to switch. "
"8373510","8378170"," And I thought I really telling that Jensen Wong said today, quote, we run everything."
"8378490","8379570"," That's a pretty bold statement."
"8380110","8385049"," And maybe I guess a rethink whenever we just refer to this company as a chip company now, when"
"8385049","8388690"," really they are claiming their more algorithm and software first. "
"8389190","8394030"," Yeah, that might be a little uncomfortable eventually for AWS and for Microsoft Azure."
"8394030","8395150"," Christina, thank you."
"8395830","8400690"," By the way, you can catch more of NVIDIA CEO, Jensen Wong's interview with Jim Kramer tonight on"
"8400690","8403530"," Mad Money at 6 p.m. Eastern. "
"8404110","8409330"," Well, NVIDIA is an investor in my next guest company and just announced an expanded partnership"
"8409330","8416890"," with it at GTC yesterday, that company's Databricks current valuation of around $43 billion, also"
"8416890","8422430"," on the streets IPO watch, joining me now in exchange exclusive to discuss all of this."
"8422430","8424690"," CEO, co-founder Ali Godsey."
"8424810","8425730"," Ali, good to see you. "
"8426390","8430570"," So many NVIDIA partnerships getting floated around out there."
"8430650","8432510"," I saw Snowflake said they had one too."
"8432690","8434470"," So what's special about yours?"
"8435530","8440530"," What's really special is that customers are coming to us and saying, we want to build our own"
"8440530","8441490"," generative AI models. "
"8441750","8443730"," So there are these really smart ones out there like CatGPT."
"8444410","8445010"," Everybody uses them."
"8445390","8449710"," But enterprises want their own so that they can compete with their competitors and have their own"
"8449710","8449910"," IP. "
"8449910","8456310"," So we're probably the vendor on the planet that has built the most number of custom AI models for"
"8456310","8456850"," our customers."
"8457230","8458710"," And we do that on NVIDIA chips."
"8459130","8463730"," And we're excited about the Blackwell 200 that's coming out and many of the other movements that"
"8463730","8465330"," are happening in this GPU space. "
"8465750","8467010"," So business is booming."
"8467230","8469550"," Everybody's interested in building their own AI models today."
"8469910","8475790"," Are you comfortable that you see the limits of NVIDIA's ambitions here and where it's safe to"
"8475790","8476670"," partner versus where?"
"8476670","8480230"," And if they're saying, Justin's saying they do it all, are they going to do what you do?"
"8481550","8484710"," Well, look, I think they're amazing at that particular thing that they do. "
"8484830","8486650"," They do also span and do many other things."
"8487030","8488790"," But, you know, it's a big market."
"8489150","8490670"," The time for AI is going to be gigantic. "
"8491230","8491250"," Right?"
"8491570","8493990"," It impacts pretty much anything on the planet that's happening."
"8494130","8496310"," So there's going to be room for lots and lots of players."
"8496530","8500570"," And, you know, if someone should be worried, it's probably, Databricks is probably not number one"
"8500570","8500930"," on the list. "
"8501410","8502390"," Yeah, I agree."
"8502710","8504110"," Based on what I see, that makes sense."
"8504110","8508630"," Now, a couple of weeks ago, you were saying that you expect the price of accelerators, and that's"
"8508630","8513830"," just the chips part of what's being used right now to develop a lot of these models. "
"8514030","8517530"," You expect the price of that to come down in the next couple of years."
"8517650","8518830"," Is that still your expectation?"
"8519390","8524370"," Because it sounds like part of what Jensen is saying about NVIDIA is, hey, we do a lot more than"
"8524370","8525710"," just sell accelerator chips."
"8525850","8529230"," And, by the way, people are going to need a lot of this technology for inferencing as well. "
"8530010","8532330"," Yes, I wasn't commenting on how NVIDIA will do."
"8532330","8533550"," I think NVIDIA will do it fabulously."
"8534230","8537010"," I'm just commenting on the price of GPUs, right?"
"8537230","8539530"," The supply of these GPUs is just increasing. "
"8539830","8542610"," There's just so many vendors that are coming to the market with their own variants."
"8543970","8548090"," And, you know, there's just, you know, there's been so much demand for these."
"8548470","8549930"," And I think the supply will increase this year. "
"8550170","8553830"," And we're already seeing it when we talk to the folks that sell these."
"8553830","8558930"," Before it was, you have to commit to me and buy lots of them three years in advance and pay"
"8558930","8559830"," for them 24-7."
"8560190","8563530"," Now, negotiations are sort of lightening up and they're saying, hey, how about you just commit to"
"8563530","8564570"," just having them for one year?"
"8565150","8566330"," Or how about you buy them for six months?"
"8566570","8569170"," And the prices have also like sort of come down in the negotiations. "
"8569910","8571450"," So that is happening now."
"8571690","8574090"," Now, NVIDIA is on a tear and there's no doubt about it."
"8574730","8580090"," Alia, what industry do you expect we're going to see the needle moving productivity gains in AI"
"8580090","8582130"," show up at the macro level first?"
"8583090","8583650"," Yeah. "
"8587070","8588190"," All right."
"8588830","8592230"," We're going to take a look at tap screen down here."
"8594730","8597870"," And this is this is my screen down below. "
"8599410","8604250"," And what I want to I wish I could show you more in the background, but what I really want"
"8604250","8612770"," to show you here is this can be this is a great way to look at some exploration."
"8613010","8614630"," We got the expiration coming up tomorrow."
"8615670","8618370"," These are the last two of the aspirations. "
"8618850","8621210"," I believe we got the third one coming up tomorrow."
"8622210","8625110"," But what I want to key into you."
"8625430","8627290"," This is the day before of expiration. "
"8628470","8631610"," And you see how they ramp up volatility."
"8633190","8635550"," And they murder volatility after."
"8637130","8639010"," Of expiration, right?"
"8639770","8641870"," Kind of the same thing here, right?"
"8642090","8645290"," They ramp up volatility and they murder. "
"8646470","8648130"," They murder the VIX."
"8649210","8651410"," And we have a new one coming up right now."
"8652630","8657790"," And you've got what happening slightly different right now, right?"
"8658510","8660730"," But we are before of expiration. "
"8661390","8662430"," See that before."
"8663380","8665010"," Today is before of expiration."
"8666090","8672270"," So the question becomes, are we going to roll this down into the expiration and then kill it,"
"8672410","8672610"," right?"
"8673210","8674690"," So we've got the Fed meeting tomorrow. "
"8675130","8677090"," Hope we can get a low down here tomorrow."
"8678200","8683990"," You get your VIXpiration and then you get the ramp up and out of expiration."
"8684650","8688130"," Now right now looking at where price is. "
"8691050","8694770"," Looking at where we are right now in price, it doesn't, it looks strong, right?"
"8695050","8701130"," This looks like we're ramping or murdering the VIX before we get to VIXpiration tomorrow."
"8703230","8705910"," So that's some cost for concerned a little bit different, right?"
"8706150","8706490"," This time."
"8706930","8713870"," But my point here is that we have a lot of fuckery around the VIX. "
"8714430","8717490"," So let's see if we can see anything on the nine day."
"8722450","8725010"," Let's check out the VIX nine day expiration."
"8727330","8728790"," Let's take a look at it here. "
"8729910","8731450"," This is the VIX nine day."
"8738420","8740280"," And just let's take a look at this, right?"
"8740600","8742780"," Let's like look back here and see what's going on."
"8742900","8743480"," We come on down. "
"8743760","8746440"," Loves that daily trigger down there, right?"
"8746740","8748280"," Loves bouncing off that daily trigger."
"8749320","8751680"," And we don't have a spike in the VIX today, do we?"
"8752480","8756940"," So this is when you hear me talk about what I expect out of the VIX."
"8757280","8759600"," I'm sure there's a bunch of voltraders out there. "
"8760060","8763280"," They're like, I just keep buying this shit and it goes up, right?"
"8763640","8765040"," Keep buying this shit, it goes up."
"8765400","8766580"," And right now we're kind of there."
"8767160","8771640"," Now there is this hourly trigger rolling down on the VIX, the downside. "
"8773620","8777120"," But it does show me what we have the potential."
"8777640","8787120"," It shows me that we have the potential to do both things, that we have the potential here to make"
"8787120","8791240"," a nice upside move and a nice downside move for VIXpiration."
"8792240","8796600"," So if you're a bear, you know, don't have any fear just yet, even with all this stuff that's going"
"8796600","8797240"," on up top. "
"8799000","8802840"," Even with all this stuff that's going out like you're like, oh, I'm about to be short here, Cap."
"8803080","8804340"," It's about to squeeze me out some more."
"8805160","8805660"," It's possible. "
"8806380","8808500"," But just keep an eye on that VIX."
"8810600","8812840"," Keep an eye on that VIX into tomorrow."
"8813240","8817440"," If we squeeze up into tomorrow, if we squeeze up, look at this. "
"8817600","8818620"," They're trying to look at NVDA."
"8818820","8819260"," They took that."
"8819460","8821640"," They bought this shit like it was nobody's business down here. "
"8821760","8822060"," Look at that."
"8823200","8825140"," Bought that shit like it was nobody's business."
"8825540","8826340"," Keep your eye out. "
"8826440","8827560"," We didn't quite hit 900."
"8828620","8836120"," We hit the top on NVDA was 897.15. We didn't quite hit the 900."
"8836840","8845700"," So you could possibly even see into this close today, a Selva news moment for the bulls where they"
"8845700","8847180"," actually blast us up. "
"8850500","8850980"," Right?"
"8851380","8856940"," And then you get your actual, then you get your actual, like you can squeeze on every fucking bear"
"8856940","8859740"," and then you get your VIXpiration trade."
"8860900","8861900"," So just be aware of that."
"8862440","8865580"," Keep an eye on NVDA as it trades 900. "
"8866600","8869780"," Or if it trades 900, keep an eye on it."
"8870500","8874280"," If we do begin to trade higher and we do begin to get higher highs."
"8875460","8877740"," If you want to know where that is, let me see if I can show it to you. "
"8879460","8884480"," So SPX has 51.80. That is, we put this up here for a minute."
"8884760","8885140"," Hold on here."
"8885260","8887000"," This is when we need our trusty levels. "
"8888600","8890720"," I'm going to give you a couple more targets to the upside."
"8893300","8895780"," There's 520 right there."
"8899630","8900350"," There's red. "
"8901230","8901810"," It's red."
"8902850","8905510"," We're going to put two more boxes up here for your targets."
"8905810","8906270"," One right here. "
"8909670","8910870"," I think that one yellow."
"8911650","8912530"," That one yellow."
"8930900","8933060"," Five, 16, 50 would be first target. "
"8936820","8938260"," And I will say something."
"8938960","8942580"," If they run us up into."
"8945220","8946820"," Oh yeah, trader podcast. "
"8947180","8948500"," I guarantee it that they are."
"8949600","8950120"," Yeah."
"8950520","8954860"," So 900 is top on NVDA 900. "
"8955600","8957500"," Whether you know it or not is top."
"8957660","8958420"," We didn't tag it yet."
"8958420","8960160"," We hit 897. "
"8960940","8963060"," So there could be like one more."
"8963540","8964240"," One more."
"8964240","8966940"," Just like, you know, push us up. "
"8967100","8967600"," Hit 900."
"8967980","8970160"," The actual cell was right here tomorrow."
"8973000","8973880"," So be careful. "
"8974100","8976120"," Not be careful if you're a bear or anything like that."
"8976240","8978880"," Just be ready to jump in again if possible."
"8985650","8986910"," Any thoughts on Goldman?"
"8987250","8988810"," I went over Goldman earlier this morning. "
"8989930","8991350"," They were very positive."
"8991350","8996110"," I don't know about go off, but Goldman's calling for 1700."
"8996870","8999990"," I think 1750 on NVDA. "
"9003010","9005150"," I'm always looking for that fuckery."
"9006030","9008350"," If you're like the snow trade."
"9008750","9012410"," Like a hanger on trade. "
"9013310","9013950"," Sorry."
"9014470","9015470"," Like there's."
"9016170","9019330"," You know what I should try to do is bring a winky on. "
"9019810","9021170"," Because we'll tell you the truth."
"9021170","9023090"," There's only a few companies are going to do this shit."
"9026410","9029110"," Oh, I thought you meant Goldman as the sorry. "
"9029390","9031530"," G grab GP grabber."
"9031650","9034890"," I did not go over Goldman the company or the ticker."
"9035070","9038170"," I was going over some Goldman Sachs statements from this morning. "
"9043240","9046100"," I think we're I think we're rotating back into."
"9046540","9047700"," Okay, it's time out here."
"9049220","9053580"," So I think we're rotating back into risk personally. "
"9054600","9058720"," From looking at the PPOs PMOs and the market breath."
"9059880","9063700"," I see a rotation back into risk and that would include financials."
"9064740","9065580"," Goldman Sachs. "
"9067260","9070440"," I think though the low is to mark not today."
"9070640","9071220"," I think it's tomorrow."
"9072000","9073120"," I hope it doesn't get front run. "
"9073220","9075780"," I hope that we get a low tomorrow that there is some blood."
"9076600","9079520"," Some kind of some kind of like just just volatile weakness."
"9080480","9086540"," They get their they get their these bears get this nice low that people can enter the market. "
"9086740","9090360"," And then there's a moments like how do I explain this?"
"9090980","9091620"," There's a."
"9094200","9098620"," Let me come back on screen right now so you guys can tell if I'm talking."
"9100700","9101760"," Think tight here."
"9103880","9105920"," There's a there's like a post. "
"9106740","9108120"," What does Vol say?"
"9108340","9110700"," Vol says there's a post like a vent hangover."
"9112420","9113100"," So."
"9114100","9116340"," You got like bulls and bears. "
"9116460","9117000"," Okay."
"9117320","9118700"," And they get very emotional."
"9119400","9120900"," Around these times. "
"9121560","9122880"," So gather around."
"9123020","9123800"," This is a fireside chat."
"9126140","9128260"," Gather and youngins. "
"9130800","9132680"," This isn't every time."
"9133020","9133120"," Okay."
"9134700","9136800"," But I want you to know. "
"9138200","9141860"," That's dealers market makers dealers."
"9142580","9146000"," They provide the market for you."
"9146260","9146900"," Okay. "
"9148400","9151040"," And we get very wrapped up and emotional."
"9151780","9153860"," As market participants."
"9153860","9157900"," And whether the market's going to go up or go down. "
"9159440","9161100"," So when we come into volatility."
"9162280","9163460"," When we come into."
"9164900","9166600"," You know, doom and gloom. "
"9166820","9168580"," Let's say that Jerome says something really nasty."
"9169880","9172100"," Let's say Jerome says something really awesome."
"9173380","9176720"," Yeah, they'll chase those events for those things. "
"9177880","9180020"," But right now coming into those events."
"9181540","9184100"," They provide the liquidity for you and I."
"9185160","9186360"," You have a feeling."
"9187180","9188300"," On to what's going to happen. "
"9189140","9190580"," If that doesn't happen."
"9191500","9192760"," They wrap up."
"9193860","9196040"," The dealers will wrap up that trade. "
"9196820","9199040"," Even if the price goes down or up."
"9200540","9202860"," And so the idea here is you have less participants."
"9204760","9207040"," Going forward after tomorrow. "
"9207040","9211300"," And we don't like we've got some involved for the rest of the week."
"9211300","9212140"," We got some other stuff."
"9212160","9213120"," We got end of the month stuff. "
"9214260","9215440"," And the quarter stuff."
"9216080","9218080"," We got some cool like exploration stuff."
"9218980","9219880"," We got some really cool. "
"9220320","9221860"," We've got what the JPM caller."
"9223340","9225440"," Is not pertinent at the moment."
"9226340","9229900"," Not important or the top strike is not important right now at the moment. "
"9230000","9230900"," The bottom strikes are."
"9232020","9235700"," But the top strike isn't really like a magnet or a repeller or anything."
"9235700","9237940"," Right now it's not like anti magnet or magnet. "
"9239800","9241520"," But you know even on end of quarter."
"9242340","9243140"," End of month."
"9243440","9244040"," Last day. "
"9245280","9247260"," We've got some really cool stuff with that right."
"9247480","9248820"," They put a big edge in the market."
"9249640","9252560"," They counter about trade it with a bunch of zero day calls. "
"9252980","9256760"," Then we got new quarterly flows that come out the first two weeks."
"9257160","9258040"," The point here is this."
"9259080","9261840"," These liquidity providers right for your puts in your calls. "
"9262520","9263900"," They wrap that trade up."
"9264820","9269380"," All the fervor leading up into these events usually subsides afterwards."
"9271060","9274460"," So you need renewed volatility afterwards. "
"9274700","9280340"," Well that's positive or negative for continuation for more market participants to enter."
"9281160","9285320"," Even when we get those new participants there's usually a reset period."
"9286240","9288060"," Could be one day could be half a day. "
"9288420","9290720"," Sometimes it's you know like a few days later."
"9290720","9296360"," My point here is these dealers will wrap up that trade on you regardless of renewed interest."
"9297340","9302020"," And so it's sometimes called the post like a vent hangover. "
"9303240","9305480"," So even if we squeeze up today is my point."
"9305880","9308120"," Whether we squeeze up today and then roll it down into tomorrow."
"9308780","9311360"," Whether we roll right here where we are down into tomorrow. "
"9311800","9316400"," There will be a moment here where this whole entire trade is wrapped up and gone."
"9317080","9319320"," And there will be like this like re-pricing."
"9320580","9322460"," Even if more interest comes in. "
"9322720","9324160"," They have to chase a trade and all that kind of stuff."
"9324400","9330620"," Just know that the dealers are like you're going to fuck both of these bulls and these bears if we"
"9330620","9330900"," can."
"9331540","9333900"," They would love to fuck you both. "
"9334740","9337800"," Reset the trade and have you retrade it again."
"9338820","9340420"," So you have to come back into the market."
"9340580","9341720"," So even if your thesis was right. "
"9342720","9344320"," Whether it was up or down they don't care."
"9345000","9347640"," They reset the trade on your ass."
"9348320","9352340"," And then you get to take the continuation trade afterwards. "
"9353160","9357380"," Just be aware of that into all of this stuff."
"9357680","9362860"," The Fed minutes, the Vickspiration, the end of month flows."
"9363280","9364160"," And remember this too. "
"9364980","9368120"," Like there's still a pin on the market."
"9369160","9378120"," Not a pin but the magic hand in the air that's like we got this trade on that we want"
"9378120","9378660"," to print."
"9380700","9381660"," Into end of month. "
"9382160","9384360"," Yeah, we did our OPEX but we're at the end of quarter."
"9384560","9387680"," We got a bunch of trades on that we want to print like right."
"9387940","9391720"," You'll see him park the bus once again into the last day of the month for a quarter. "
"9392960","9393760"," Quite heavily."
"9394280","9396420"," So just be aware of that as we come into the month."
"9401820","9405200"," Now if I looked at the Goldman, have I looked at the Goldman chart?"
"9405440","9405800"," I have not. "
"9406120","9406920"," Although I haven't recently."
"9408180","9409580"," But I will if you want me to."
"9410180","9410980"," Let me take a look at it GP. "
"9413420","9415280"," So I'm like really sick here."
"9415460","9416800"," I feel really terrible."
"9417420","9418500"," I might actually have to end. "
"9418720","9423660"," I'll leave the stream up but there might be a moment here where I won't be on stream with you."
"9423660","9426920"," I'm going to give you a heads up on this because I'm really feeling like shit right now."
"9430660","9431960"," Let me take a look really quick. "
"9433960","9435340"," I feel like dog shit."
"9435640","9438840"," I feel like I got run over by a fucking truck."
"9440620","9442420"," So do I like GS here?"
"9443140","9443820"," I do. "
"9445520","9448020"," I want to see a successful back test."
"9450520","9452240"," So it's coming down right now."
"9452240","9454500"," Maybe you're wondering why it's coming down right now. "
"9454500","9457520"," I want to see GS come back and retest."
"9458980","9461640"," So this is a good trade to look at."
"9461760","9462500"," We'll look at it right now. "
"9467900","9469720"," So let's look at GS."
"9475080","9477360"," GS just keeps grinding right?"
"9477780","9481620"," Higher and higher and higher off of its one day trigger."
"9483520","9485120"," Let's take a look at it right now. "
"9485120","9488240"," Now we do have something that's concerning here."
"9489000","9498140"," I do not like seeing daily velocity going against price on Goldman Sachs right now."
"9498900","9500280"," I actually don't like that. "
"9501340","9502680"," I'm not a fan of it at all."
"9504920","9508220"," Let's look at some prior examples of this with Goldman."
"9510440","9512540"," I want you to see this here. "
"9516220","9518020"," Goldman looks great right here, right?"
"9518320","9518860"," And what happens?"
"9519320","9523220"," Rips faces down really fast and then an upside move."
"9524040","9526960"," But you can see it right here on this flat velocity here."
"9527760","9529080"," I like this velocity. "
"9529660","9529980"," This is great."
"9530380","9531340"," It's a great trade right there."
"9532380","9537160"," When this velocity starts getting funky down here, we're kind of right here, aren't we?"
"9537840","9538660"," Like right there. "
"9539900","9543100"," So right now I'm not a fan of..."
"9543940","9547340"," Or I think this trade with Goldman is dangerous."
"9548480","9554500"," And I think it's easy for you to see Goldman between very soon to eat whether they get a new"
"9554500","9555100"," high or not."
"9555620","9558920"," They come back down and blast through and trade 362. "
"9559560","9564720"," So for me, to be a buyer of Goldman Sachs, I'd be a buyer at 362 33."
"9566580","9567060"," Personally."
"9567800","9569620"," Can they continue to grind higher and get a new high?"
"9569620","9571900"," Can all of this building up mean something to the upside?"
"9572260","9572400"," Sure. "
"9572660","9578180"," But for me, seeing this velocity..."
"9580200","9581280"," Sorry, I'm going to throw up."
"9582100","9586940"," Seeing this velocity at near zero, the divergence in price and velocity."
"9587860","9593860"," I think it goes higher, but I think you're going to have a moment of weakness in Goldman. "
"9594860","9597700"," So I would say be..."
"9598340","9600620"," I would say be..."
"9605400","9606540"," To the deep..."
"9606540","9607280"," Yeah."
"9607980","9608880"," Agree too, Jimmy."
"9611500","9612680"," God, I can't fucking..."
"9612680","9614580"," I can't believe I feel like this much shit. "
"9616300","9617880"," Goldman, I'd be where..."
"9617880","9619000"," Nothing can't go up here."
"9619240","9619600"," It can squeeze."
"9619980","9623180"," It's a very volatile trade in Goldman Sachs. "
"9623180","9625720"," And I would expect that if it's squeezed, it's going to get sold."
"9626080","9629960"," Maybe I should say it'd be different on my Goldman thesis."
"9630580","9634620"," I would say on Goldman, if it squeezes, sell the fuck out of it. "
"9635540","9639440"," If it blood baths down to 362, buy the fuck out of it."
"9640060","9646220"," Where it is right now, I think, is a game of danger for both bulls and bears."
"9647260","9649360"," I don't think it's the place that I would want to own it. "
"9650240","9651280"," Or even trade it."
"9652600","9655480"," Goldman does really well on blood baths."
"9657680","9660740"," I would rather be a buyer on a Goldman blood bath. "
"9661140","9663200"," We've seen that on all of their ERs, right?"
"9663460","9664960"," They set a really cool tone."
"9665660","9668140"," They get a blood bath and then it's a great buy."
"9670560","9675540"," So here for me on Goldman, I got nothing for it. "
"9676120","9678880"," Even if it goes up, I got nothing for it going down or up."
"9678880","9683820"," I don't like the divergence in their deli velocity for me to be a buyer."
"9687420","9688640"," Yeah, I know. "
"9690120","9692400"," I'm not feeling well right now."
"9693120","9695820"," I can't tell you guys, like, I didn't want to stream today."
"9696180","9696820"," I'll be honest with you. "
"9698880","9700360"," I don't feel good."
"9700820","9702140"," I feel really bad."
"9703320","9704680"," Now I'll leave you with this too. "
"9705680","9707280"," Before the day."
"9707500","9709340"," Now I feel really sick."
"9709580","9711880"," I think I'm going to take a quick break here. "
"9712940","9714460"," It's one forty five in the afternoon."
"9715600","9721700"," I'm going to give I will have for you expectations for tomorrow."
"9722280","9730640"," Before four p.m. What to expect tomorrow for the big event so you can be properly positioned. "
"9731460","9733580"," You know where we are right now."
"9733580","9735900"," This is the place to put on a hedge."
"9736600","9738720"," You might get squeezed out into the clothes today. "
"9738780","9740520"," They might run you straight up into five twenty."
"9741300","9743880"," There's another place for you to buy more cheap puts."
"9745200","9747520"," Buy yourself some next stuff right next Monday. "
"9748140","9750500"," Sixteen cent twenty eight cent twenty six cent puts."
"9753240","9754400"," Close your laptops."
"9754560","9755420"," If you're a bear. "
"9757300","9758060"," I'm a buyer."
"9758520","9760200"," So I'm not a seller of rips here."
"9760200","9762240"," I'm not a I'm a bear above the hourly trigger. "
"9764340","9767200"," I'm not that we're we're bullish in my view."
"9767460","9770640"," So I'm still a buyer of dips wherever we go."
"9772060","9773040"," There's nothing here. "
"9773200","9775600"," There's nothing here that I don't see us as buyer of dips."
"9776200","9777100"," Nothing that I've seen."
"9777540","9778480"," Just see volatility. "
"9779160","9780340"," See volatility this week."
"9780980","9782080"," We saw it last week."
"9782140","9784300"," We described it to you on Monday of last week. "
"9785700","9788740"," Every time we come up we'll get violent drops to the downside."
"9789640","9794680"," And then as soon as that volatility ends you should see a period of volume come into the market and"
"9794680","9795920"," you should see the market go higher."
"9797200","9799340"," I'm not on on crash camp. "
"9799760","9801460"," I'm not on correction camp."
"9802160","9807180"," There's nothing that I see anywhere right now that leads me to believe that."
"9807300","9811920"," I would need to see some severe selling for that to happen and take place. "
"9816290","9816930"," All right."
"9817390","9818950"," So I'll be back with you guys in a little bit."
"9820170","9822430"," I'll be back before four p.m. with some updates. "
"9822770","9829970"," I will give you updates on Spy QQQ's NVDA if you want it."
"9830690","9831970"," SMCI all that kind of stuff."
"9833130","9834450"," I'll do like you. "
"9834730","9836990"," I'll do SpyQ's NVDA."
"9837350","9839950"," I think Tesla's going to be done here in a little bit."
"9840230","9843970"," So I'll get some Tesla out to you at some point today as well. "
"9845170","9845570"," Cool."
"9846510","9847610"," Yeah, I don't feel well."
"9847610","9850290"," I got to tell you guys, I got to be here for you tomorrow. "
"9851010","9855910"," And I don't want to fucking wake up in the morning and not be able to do the show."
"9856390","9858270"," And I need you to understand how sick I really am."
"9858410","9859030"," I got a temperature. "
"9859570","9861370"," A temperature is like fucking over 100 degrees."
"9862370","9863690"," I'm fucking dying here."
"9863990","9871050"," And I really apologize to be sick right now in a very important market moment for you. "
"9871210","9875130"," So I'm going to take breaks when I need to to be able to be here for you streaming the"
"9875130","9875730"," rest of this week."
"9875730","9881510"," So we can navigate the dangers presented to us as the week progresses."
"9884510","9887410"," Yeah, I didn't carry you guys through this shit dude. "
"9887570","9890870"," I really feel like I want to say something to you guys."
"9892110","9897130"," Something I wasn't able to do prior to the website launch was like be here for you."
"9897350","9899810"," Now I have the time to be here for you. "
"9900290","9901690"," Like I can write you the briefs."
"9901690","9902890"," I can spend the time."
"9903590","9912730"," So I really appreciate the ability to do more of this more comprehensively day in day out. "
"9913950","9916170"," It makes me happier."
"9916710","9918110"," I don't know why, but it just makes me happier."
"9920330","9921010"," All right. "
"9921570","9923950"," I'll be here with you back with you here shortly."
"9923970","9925010"," It's one 48 PM."
"9925310","9930370"," Again, be careful of the two PM manipulation that happens in the market. "
"9930370","9936230"," If you don't know what I'm talking about with the two PM manipulation of the marketplace, get"
"9936230","9941970"," inside the discord and ask David AMS. Ask him in the general chat."
"9942350","9945530"," Ask him in the pro chat and see what he has to say about it. "
"9946030","9946230"," Okay."
"9946790","9953370"," From my perspective, what he's going to say is likely going to be what I will tell you here right"
"9953370","9953650"," now."
"9954350","9957630"," I have no interest in trading this as a bull here. "
"9959550","9962370"," There's would be interest above this zone."
"9962690","9963110"," We're trading."
"9964670","9966250"," Let me explain it better to you. "
"9966330","9968410"," If I could go down the bottom right hand side over here."
"9970910","9972630"," So just down in here, right?"
"9972790","9974190"," There's a lot of money we made in here, right?"
"9974630","9978050"," There's a lot of money down in here, right?"
"9978370","9978570"," You got."
"9980290","9981370"," You're making money. "
"9982110","9983130"," You're getting the pullback."
"9983290","9983730"," Making money."
"9984170","9984870"," You're getting the pullback. "
"9985030","9985450"," Making the money."
"9985450","9988330"," You're getting the pullback and money pullback, right?"
"9988550","9991370"," Making the money and do we get into the pullback?"
"9992170","9993810"," You want to be trading those extremes?"
"9995930","10000470"," Now, if you're like, well, what a cap would we start hitting higher here, right?"
"10000730","10001190"," That's okay."
"10001250","10001970"," We can trade that. "
"10002750","10004430"," But let's look at it to trade it."
"10005250","10006750"," So how do we trade that?"
"10007970","10014450"," If there's a breakout to the upside, how do we trade the breakout, right?"
"10015990","10018250"," It's most certainly is not right here."
"10019370","10022750"," It is most certainly not right here. "
"10023350","10025250"," This is the danger zone for a bull."
"10026590","10028470"," And you have to say, what does that mean cap?"
"10028630","10029370"," How do we do that, right?"
"10029590","10031530"," So you have the local resistance back here."
"10031610","10033450"," This is your previous high, right?"
"10035350","10036350"," Let's draw that in. "
"10037170","10038030"," You can do this at home."
"10038270","10038990"," Follow me at home with this."
"10040190","10042350"," You have this nice little previous high up here, right?"
"10047430","10048890"," You can see it right there, right?"
"10052060","10053260"," This is a red. "
"10055360","10055980"," That's right."
"10061880","10065520"," So you're looking for price to get higher, right?"
"10066240","10067680"," But not just get higher."
"10067880","10069640"," It's not good enough getting the new high, is it?"
"10070400","10073460"," You have to get the new high, right?"
"10074760","10078480"," That's 51.99. 50, 200, right?"
"10078680","10079280"," You get the new high. "
"10080600","10081900"," Still not good enough."
"10082080","10082460"," Take trade."
"10083460","10085560"," You want to see the pullback down here, right?"
"10086480","10093720"," Come back down to 51.80. You want to see one, two, right?"
"10095560","10097300"," And then a new high right there. "
"10099580","10103860"," You need to actually see this whole thing happen."
"10105780","10106980"," One, right?"
"10107660","10108400"," Then the new high."
"10108780","10117360"," When you get that new high right there, not just this previous high, but this new high, there's"
"10117360","10118320"," usually a pullback. "
"10118720","10122000"," This would be where you'd see the hourly trigger come up."
"10122860","10129240"," This is the one where we have continuation to the upside for days and days and days and days and"
"10129240","10129500"," weeks."
"10130720","10132460"," You might be like, oh, cap. "
"10132760","10138260"," Like I missed all this trade here and I missed all that trade right there, but I can show it"
"10138260","10138660"," to you."
"10139600","10147960"," You get days and weeks ahead of you of like a 70% chance of continuation of the upside."
"10148440","10150440"," These are very good probabilities. "
"10150500","10152320"," Like every time we come back, I'm going to go buy a dip."
"10152860","10154060"," I know it's going to hold and we're going to go up."
"10154120","10159360"," I'm going to start trading 5.30, 5.35, 5.50 and all this other shit up here. "
"10159360","10163820"," Like if you want to trade all this shit up here, you know, all this right here?"
"10164720","10168220"," This is the meat of the trade here to here."
"10169460","10170760"," Not this bullshit."
"10172060","10173320"," Does that make sense to you?"
"10174140","10175400"," It's like this shit doesn't mean anything. "
"10176100","10179040"," Now that is some sexy trade right there."
"10179340","10179920"," Big money."
"10180300","10180600"," Chitching. "
"10181580","10182060"," Big money."
"10182540","10182600"," Safety."
"10183380","10184000"," Whole nine yards. "
"10184400","10185000"," Trading 5,300."
"10186720","10188920"," In here is where you get the ball."
"10189720","10191580"," They're a very dangerous place to be long. "
"10192260","10196060"," So if you're not going to trade that, you're going to do it."
"10196140","10199720"," If you go to the discord, now it's David AMS. He's going to tell you, fuck no. "
"10200300","10202760"," He's going to be like, fuck no, I'm buying this down here."
"10203420","10204780"," It's worked so many times."
"10204800","10205360"," Worked there. "
"10205540","10206020"," Worked there."
"10206220","10206760"," Worked there."
"10207960","10211480"," I'm looking to come in here and buy that breakout right there. "
"10212000","10218620"," And he's going to tell you, or I'm looking waiting to get above this and consolidate and turn this"
"10218620","10219460"," into support."
"10220200","10220700"," Does that make sense?"
"10221760","10223900"," And then fuck yeah, we're going to do another trade to the upside."
"10224780","10231580"," Right now where we are is very dangerous for you as a bull to be taking a trade right here. "
"10232360","10233440"," Do you understand me?"
"10234060","10234600"," Listen to me closely."
"10235500","10241140"," If you don't understand this even after going it right now at this moment, I'm going to ask you to"
"10241140","10242480"," go into the discord and ask him."
"10243140","10244880"," Ask David AMS. Ask."
"10245600","10247160"," Who else do I trust in there?"
"10247340","10247780"," John L."
"10248040","10248640"," You can ask him."
"10249140","10251100"," You can ask any of the mentors, the moderators. "
"10251820","10254460"," They should have a firm understanding or grasp of this."
"10255080","10257900"," So just be wary here of being a bull."
"10259700","10260440"," Makes sense?"
"10265580","10267260"," You want to make the mix great again. "
"10274860","10279120"," Yeah, I'm with you on that."
"10279240","10280260"," I think there's one more trade here."
"10281080","10282120"," I'll go JBJ. "
"10282240","10283760"," I think there's one more like ball trade."
"10284200","10287200"," You get you one more chance to get till tomorrow."
"10289200","10290780"," Hey, what's going on short seller?"
"10291200","10292180"," Good morning, my man. "
"10292280","10292800"," Good afternoon."
"10293120","10293580"," I apologize."
"10293740","10294900"," I'm really sick, brother. "
"10296100","10297560"," Like violently ill."
"10297820","10299480"," Kids who got me like they got me."
"10299620","10300780"," The fucking kids got me. "
"10301780","10302300"," Again."
"10305360","10307220"," These kids are dirty, man."
"10307560","10308800"," They are so dusty. "
"10310080","10312820"," I was watching them at that dance and I'm like they're disgusting."
"10314400","10314920"," Disgusting."
"10316320","10317780"," They don't wash their hands. "
"10318060","10318740"," They go in the bathrooms."
"10319220","10320660"," They share candy and stuff."
"10322720","10323440"," Yeah, dude. "
"10323440","10324240"," I've been sick, man."
"10324640","10328580"," I got sick on Friday and it got worse and Sunday came."
"10329280","10330080"," Throwing up everywhere. "
"10330760","10333140"," Like I got temperature, went to the doctor."
"10334520","10335600"," It's getting worse and worse."
"10336980","10337620"," Oh, yeah. "
"10337800","10338340"," I've thrown up there."
"10338480","10340520"," I threw up about half an hour ago."
"10341660","10344420"," I turned the stream on pause while I did it. "
"10350100","10353540"," Did you catch all that short seller about where we are?"
"10356160","10358160"," Not the place to be a bull here."
"10358700","10361380"," Need to get above and make a support zone."
"10364140","10368700"," If not, the Voll crowd is trying to buy some Voll one more time. "
"10371000","10371600"," Yeah."
"10373780","10375560"," Vellow is saying the same thing."
"10376340","10382800"," It's not saying crash, but velocity is saying that there's likely one more. "
"10383360","10386260"," We've got a squeeze coming in our hand saying we've got a squeeze potential."
"10386280","10392340"," It's also saying that there's one more chance here for Voll buyers into tomorrow."
"10395500","10396720"," Yeah, be wary, dude. "
"10396920","10400320"," We're not just wary, but we want to get above."
"10401420","10402980"," Here's the SPX."
"10403160","10404640"," You want to get above 5180, brother?"
"10406020","10410480"," And make that support first before you start the next leg up for bulls. "
"10410480","10412340"," To 50, get 300."
"10414200","10416260"," What a fucking puke right now, man."
"10426750","10431050"," Yeah, velocity is very sketchy right now in the daily trigger. "
"10432230","10433190"," It's not supportive."
"10434310","10436230"," If we go down and test it, we'll blast through it."
"10438150","10439950"," It's not supportive right now. "
"10444560","10450600"," It's got like it's like its support is like at 50% strength."
"10456220","10458740"," You got your three targets above here, too."
"10460840","10462520"," I'm going to fucking get ill, man. "
"10463260","10464760"," Let me just put that right there for you."
"10467260","10468100"," Oh, yeah."
"10472100","10476580"," They said I could get I could get kicked off Twitch or something if I puke. "
"10476660","10477960"," I was going to puke on screen earlier."
"10478880","10480120"," Someone was like, don't do it."
"10480200","10482420"," You'll get a kick you off for a week or something. "
"10484280","10486760"," And there goes Captain gone for a week from streaming."
"10495160","10497360"," All right, so I will see you."
"10497440","10498020"," I'm going to take a break. "
"10498600","10503780"," I'm going to be back with you guys before four p.m. I need to get some fresh air."
"10503900","10505040"," I need to go outside and breathe air."
"10505400","10508840"," So I'm going to take a quick break to try to not throw up. "
"10511240","10515480"," And I'll be back with you before four p.m. with more trades for tomorrow."
"10515680","10517420"," You guys already have the trades tomorrow right now."
"10518600","10522820"," This is the place the Bible puts our dirt fucking cheap. "
"10524180","10526640"," 16 cent for 5,000 for Friday."
"10526900","10528560"," I don't know what the fuck you can't buy those."
"10529160","10531660"," There's no reason you can't afford. "
"10531760","10537500"," If you guys are trading for you guys are trading big money out there trading a 16 cent put."
"10538140","10539300"," No fucking brainer."
"10542720","10543180"," Yeah. "
"10544360","10545480"," I'm going to throw up right now."
"10546820","10548400"," I'll be back with just a little bit with you guys."
"10551660","10637430"," It begins"
"10637430","10637730"," here. "
"10645210","10648190"," Good afternoon everybody and welcome to power lunch alongside Leslie Picker."
"10648310","10648790"," I'm Tyler Matheson."
"10649310","10650250"," Nice to have you with us today. "
"10650570","10651650"," And nice to have you with us today."
"10651970","10654470"," Once again, two big stories dominating the market."
"10654650","10656710"," That would be Nvidia and the Fed. "
"10656950","10659310"," But let's start with the check on the markets right now."
"10659530","10661050"," They are higher across the board."
"10661230","10666270"," They're now getting a boost from Home Depot, which was initiated at buy at Miss Zuho McDonald's"
"10666270","10667450"," higher by nearly 2%. "
"10667450","10674770"," After announcing CEO Chris Kempinsky, was going to add the chairman title to his accolades."
"10675070","10680950"," Despite the excitement surrounding Nvidia, the stock up less than 1% today and other chip stocks"
"10680950","10685610"," are lower, including a big drop in Super Micro as it plans to sell more shares."
"10686250","10693690"," And a big jump infusion pharmaceuticals up nearly 100% today after Seneca offering to buy the"
"10693690","10699010"," company for $2 billion plus another 400 million if milestones are achieved. "
"10699510","10703050"," Fusion is working on new ways to target cancer cells."
"10703550","10707990"," And with just 24 hours until we hear from the Fed, that is where we're going to start today."
"10708270","10709350"," So what will the Fed do?"
"10709530","10710390"," And when will they do it?"
"10710810","10716870"," The latest CNBC survey showing the economist, strategist and fund managers polled expect three rate"
"10716870","10719850"," cuts this year with the first coming in June. "
"10720570","10725850"," Our next guest is in that three cut camp, but with the possibility of only two."
"10726310","10728570"," Let's bring in Stephen Stanley."
"10728890","10730950"," You just saw him come in there, didn't you?"
"10731170","10732610"," You saw him shadow. "
"10732950","10737590"," You saw the shadow of Stephen Stanley, chief economist with Santander."
"10737890","10738450"," Welcome, Stephen."
"10738610","10739310"," Good to have you with us. "
"10739350","10739790"," Nice entrance."
"10740290","10740650"," Thank you."
"10740790","10741390"," Really well done. "
"10741810","10743730"," That was like a soft landing."
"10743730","10744650"," That was a soft landing."
"10744650","10745370"," That was close. "
"10745610","10746550"," We got to have a soft landing?"
"10746550","10748170"," Just giving you a little illustration."
"10748370","10748610"," Yeah."
"10748810","10749630"," That's how you do it. "
"10749730","10750250"," We're going to have one?"
"10750910","10751670"," I think so."
"10751890","10751950"," Yeah."
"10752070","10754030"," It looks like the Fed so far so good. "
"10754290","10756010"," I mean, I think we still have a ways to go on inflation."
"10757290","10761450"," So it's too soon to declare victory, but I don't think we're going to have a recession."
"10761750","10763350"," And where were you a year ago?"
"10763610","10767450"," Were you in the camp that believed that a recession was likely either in 23 or in 24?"
"10767710","10768170"," And have you changed?"
"10768890","10769050"," No. "
"10769330","10770770"," I was always a soft landing guy."
"10771810","10772570"," I think..."
"10772570","10773970"," He sent me as a hard landing."
"10773970","10774270"," Yeah. "
"10775490","10779470"," I think I would say that we've had better luck with inflation than I thought."
"10779470","10783350"," I thought inflation might be even higher than what we've seen."
"10783470","10788490"," Of course, as I said, we've still got a ways to go, but I think the Fed's made a lot"
"10788490","10789270"," of ground on that front. "
"10789550","10795010"," Do you think the Fed is going to cut rates aggressively this year or modestly this year?"
"10795190","10801810"," In other words, I would call three or more cuts aggressive, fewer than three modestly."
"10801810","10802030"," Yeah."
"10802250","10805130"," So I think their plan is probably still going to be three. "
"10805510","10810230"," When we get the dot projections tomorrow, I think that they're going to stick at three for the"
"10810230","10810410"," year."
"10810930","10815490"," Actually, I have them moving later than where most people think."
"10815570","10817230"," I don't think they get started until November. "
"10817750","10820890"," So only have two this year, but then quite a number next year."
"10820990","10823550"," I think they will cut pretty steadily next year."
"10823750","10828690"," Do you think that those cuts coincide with potentially reduction in their quantitative tightening"
"10828690","10834010"," program in terms of just the magnitude by which they're rolling off that balance sheet?"
"10834070","10834290"," Yeah. "
"10834510","10836050"," I think if it does, it'll be a coincidence."
"10836670","10839190"," I think that they're trying to run those two on separate tracks."
"10839890","10845050"," They've said it's very possible that they could continue to cut the balance sheet at the same time,"
"10845130","10849010"," if they're easing even though those two things seem to be at odds with each other. "
"10849470","10856270"," So I think the balance sheet will be determined by their view about how much, you know, where"
"10856270","10858350"," bankers are relative to where they need to be."
"10858730","10863490"," And as long as there's excess liquidity in the system, I think they'll keep going with quantitative"
"10863490","10863890"," tightening."
"10864150","10869410"," How much do other forms of credit versus the traditional banking system play into that?"
"10869550","10873890"," I ask because coinciding with this tightening campaign, we've seen this huge rise in private"
"10873890","10874290"," credit. "
"10875010","10879850"," You know, does that kind of do a disservice to the efforts that they're making in terms of"
"10879850","10880590"," quantitative tightening?"
"10880910","10883030"," Well, I think it makes the Fed's job a lot harder."
"10883030","10889730"," And I guess in some ways it's not altogether surprising that, you know, we saw a big crackdown in"
"10889730","10895410"," terms of banking regulation after the financial crisis, as you would expect, and what happens more"
"10895410","10899290"," of the credit universes move outside of that tight regulatory environment."
"10899870","10905750"," Are you worried at all, you said earlier that inflation has come down maybe more pleasantly than"
"10905750","10906950"," you had expected initially?"
"10907690","10912770"," Are you at all worried about some of the recent inflation numbers that indicate maybe it's not a"
"10912770","10915270"," straight line down to 2 percent?"
"10915410","10918890"," Yeah, I think people got a little ahead of themselves, or a lot of people did in terms of"
"10918890","10919250"," inflation. "
"10919570","10923830"," We did have some low numbers in the core inflation figures late last year."
"10924370","10927930"," I think what we're seeing is more of a normalization to where the trend is."
"10928070","10930830"," I think the trend is probably, you know, three, three and a half. "
"10931150","10937670"," And on its way down, but we maybe felt like we were, I think people got a little ahead of"
"10937670","10939290"," where we actually were last year."
"10939290","10945750"," Do you think corporate profits are going to be strong enough to support a market that may not have"
"10945750","10948330"," the aggressive rate cuts that some had anticipated?"
"10948970","10952210"," Yeah, I mean, that's been the big surprise, right?"
"10952350","10957030"," The economy has done very well in very good economic performance last year, and that's been"
"10957030","10958530"," accompanied by solid profits."
"10958830","10963670"," So every quarter, you know, equity analysts get worried about the earnings numbers, and then the"
"10963670","10965610"," earnings always seem to exceed expectations. "
"10966490","10967670"," Stephen, thank you very much."
"10967670","10968090"," That's great."
"10968390","10968870"," Appreciate it. "
"10969210","10970510"," He's a soft landing guy."
"10971410","10972930"," Both metaphorically and physically."
"10973830","10978750"," So as Wall Street tries to predict what the Fed will do next, how should you position your"
"10978750","10978970"," portfolio?"
"10978970","10980330"," Let's bring in Jim Tierney. "
"10980610","10983990"," CIO concentrated U.S. growth within Alliance Bernstein."
"10984530","10985630"," Thanks for being here."
"10986230","10987370"," So let's start there. "
"10987570","10989350"," How should you be positioning your portfolio?"
"10990510","10996890"," If we do believe in higher for longer and a stronger economy, I think you have to start thinking"
"10996890","11000510"," outside of AI, who can benefit from that reality?"
"11001350","11005230"," And there are a bunch of companies that are benefiting from it and will continue, and they really"
"11005230","11006950"," haven't been recognized in the market yet."
"11007090","11008450"," So I think there's a real opportunity."
"11009050","11009390"," Like what?"
"11010990","11012070"," One is ADP. "
"11012610","11017810"," When you look at ADP, a significant portion of their growth over the next couple of years will come"
"11017810","11023950"," from float income, with an average duration of their portfolio over three years, it takes time for"
"11023950","11026790"," that portfolio to reprice higher in terms of the securities."
"11027430","11032550"," And when that happens, that's almost 100 percent margin dollars that fall to the bottom line."
"11032910","11033970"," So that's a great opportunity. "
"11034590","11042890"," In terms of the potential risks to that, as you look at the more momentum-based trades versus those"
"11042890","11048210"," that may be unappreciated right now, how do you see the risk reward payoff looking, say, over the"
"11048210","11054410"," next six months, as we may see some production in rates, a different picture on the monetary policy"
"11054410","11054750"," backdrop."
"11055730","11059810"," You know, does that dynamic shift at all in your thinking of kind of where you see under"
"11059810","11060910"," appreciation in the market?"
"11061690","11064990"," I think earnings are going to be incredibly important in 2024."
"11065370","11067590"," They weren't quite as much in 2023. "
"11067870","11073130"," Certainly there was a huge spread between the Magnificent Seven and everything else as that spread"
"11073130","11073730"," narrows."
"11073730","11077510"," I think investors are going to start looking for what are the companies that have great earnings"
"11077510","11077890"," prospects."
"11078550","11082990"," And you look at ADP growing 14 or 15 percent last year, around 13 percent. "
"11083150","11085030"," This year, I think that's a great opportunity."
"11085490","11088590"," You will get a company like Cooper companies that makes contact lenses."
"11089270","11092750"," They grew 10 percent last year, probably grow 12 percent this year. "
"11093150","11096090"," That's really strong growth, well above what the market's doing."
"11096590","11099490"," And a couple of these companies have just been ignored so far."
"11099610","11101010"," So to me, that's the opportunity. "
"11101010","11103650"," A third company you like is Constellation Brands there."
"11103750","11107450"," I guess there's some skepticism that they're going to be able to match their growth numbers from"
"11107450","11108930"," last year, but you disagree with that."
"11109670","11114510"," I don't think they saw quite the benefit from the Bud Light share loss that everybody pins on it. "
"11115270","11120870"," Constellation has been benefiting from a trend of consumers buying more Mexican beer for well more"
"11120870","11121290"," than a decade."
"11121290","11122570"," And I think that continues."
"11123230","11125970"," The knock on the company for years has been their capital allocation. "
"11126650","11130510"," The fact that there are now some guard rails with a couple of new board numbers and an activist"
"11130510","11135910"," investor involved, I think means very positive things for capital return to shareholders,"
"11135910","11138530"," particularly as they have now delivered the balance sheet."
"11139250","11143830"," As we look ahead to the Fed, I know that you're focused on financials and specifically credit"
"11143830","11146490"," quality against this backdrop of higher for longer."
"11147250","11153370"," At what point do you see things deteriorating to the point where the Fed may need to call an"
"11153370","11155470"," audible with regard to its tightening conditions?"
"11156730","11157890"," It's a great question. "
"11158090","11163830"," And if you look at some of the credit statistics, we've seen some worsening of conditions, yet it"
"11163830","11165630"," hasn't become a full fledged panic."
"11166250","11170630"," And I think that's one of the things that the Fed has to be monitoring in terms of do we"
"11170630","11172530"," cut to preempt any kind of worsening."
"11173590","11178690"," How are you thinking about the the AI related sector or the AI companies?"
"11179050","11182630"," Anything that has AI in its name seems to be attracting a lot of money. "
"11182630","11185590"," Are you are you chasing that trend or not?"
"11186570","11188350"," We don't love to chase anything."
"11188350","11192210"," And we certainly have some names in our portfolio that are exposed to that."
"11192410","11193530"," Microsoft would be an example. "
"11194170","11199510"," If an all would be another example and even would be an example in terms of they're all involved in"
"11199510","11203130"," one way or another and seeing really nice benefits from that exposure."
"11203710","11208730"," I think the rubber is going to hit the road later on this year when investors ask who really will"
"11208730","11212150"," see an earnings benefit as opposed to just an exposure."
"11212770","11217110"," And certainly I think some of the disappointment last week with a company like Adobe in terms of"
"11217110","11219090"," not seeing that benefit immediately. "
"11219690","11223690"," I think more of that's going to happen in the market as investors become a little bit more"
"11223690","11223970"," critical."
"11224690","11229390"," As you examine what we've taken to refer to as the magnificent seven."
"11229770","11233490"," Are there any of the seven that you would absolutely stay away from?"
"11235130","11237850"," I wouldn't say that I'd absolutely stay away from anything. "
"11238650","11243090"," But I do think we're starting to see more of an earnings dispersion between the seven and a"
"11243090","11244090"," differential in performance."
"11244590","11248750"," And you look at the performance of Nvidia and Meta, which is which are both spectacular this year."
"11249010","11253810"," And then you look at the apples and the alphabets and the Teslas, which aren't quite as good as a"
"11253810","11255590"," high active share investor. "
"11256130","11259290"," I like dispersion because you can pick winners and pick losers."
"11259290","11266170"," So I'm much more pleased with the environment in 2024 than what we saw in 2023 where all boats were"
"11266170","11266510"," rising."
"11266790","11270170"," Yeah, I have to be choosy in that category certainly and elsewhere in the market. "
"11270390","11271410"," Jim Tierney, thank you very much."
"11271490","11272070"," I appreciate it."
"11272610","11276630"," And coming up speaking of Nvidia holding an AI conference in California. "
"11276990","11277450"," You hear about that?"
"11277970","11282990"," Laying out its plans for the future to investors, we will share some key takeaways in tech check"
"11282990","11285010"," more power launch coming up next."
"11501760","11502700"," Welcome back."
"11503000","11505880"," Shares of Nvidia turned around and are up slightly today. "
"11506060","11509900"," The second day of its hotly watched AI developers conference."
"11509900","11513620"," Dear Jibosa joins us live from the conference for today's tech check."
"11513780","11514300"," Hey, Leslie. "
"11516660","11518360"," So day one, it was all about Jensen's keynote."
"11518360","11524340"," Day two, we're hearing from key players throughout the Nvidia ecosystem and there are many."
"11525740","11531660"," If you look at the things that we do, we build the chips, the systems, the networking and so on"
"11531660","11533920"," and so forth, the entire data center practically. "
"11534720","11536000"," All the software that goes into it."
"11536700","11537620"," And then we sell it in parts."
"11538780","11541480"," The reason why we sell it, and that is what confuses people. "
"11541720","11544340"," They think that Nvidia is a chip company because we sell everything in parts."
"11544340","11550660"," The reason we do that is so that our customers could integrate Nvidia's technology into their data"
"11550660","11552180"," centers, however they like."
"11554300","11559840"," So attendees here, they range from the buzziest gen AI startups to the cloud hyperscalers to the"
"11559840","11561840"," academic pioneers of AI. "
"11562340","11564780"," Really living up to its title is the Woodstock of AI."
"11565400","11569500"," There's a panel tomorrow that was the brainchild of Jensen Huang himself that he will also"
"11569500","11569840"," moderate."
"11569840","11576180"," It brings together key figures in the gen AI space that co-authored a seminal academic paper years"
"11576180","11582680"," ago and then went on to found current darlings like cochier and character.ai. I just left a session"
"11582680","11586000"," with open AI, COO Brad lightcap on the future of AI. "
"11586540","11591700"," He ended up by saying that 10 years from now, if you hand a kid a laptop from our current"
"11591700","11593960"," era, he or she will try to talk at it."
"11594180","11598740"," Kind of like how kids in the iPad era try to swipe on any screen that they see."
"11598740","11603260"," So yes, the big announcement here of GTC is the efficiency and power of Nvidia's Blackwell"
"11603260","11603900"," platform. "
"11604360","11609340"," But perhaps just as important are the startups and the companies and the individuals that are here"
"11609340","11612160"," that will be building and developing using it."
"11612380","11617640"," That said, guys, everyone wants a piece of that Nvidia Halo, which has become so powerful."
"11618120","11620180"," It makes sense to have a presence here at GTC. "
"11620540","11625100"," One essential ingredient that is very clear is the talent and getting the right researchers,"
"11625520","11626760"," engineers, data scientists."
"11626760","11629920"," Some of these panels they operate almost as recruiting tools."
"11630220","11635640"," Guys, another reminder of how important that is today with that big move to Microsoft hiring a"
"11635640","11637220"," DeepMind co-founder is this head of AI. "
"11637700","11643340"," And I'm sure at this point in time, there's probably nascent availability of people who are experts"
"11643340","11646700"," in this area because the technology itself is so nascent."
"11647460","11650520"," That's interesting that it serves as a kind of recruiting platform there."
"11650520","11657000"," And also interesting, and it's the perfect kind of microcosm of just the flywheel effect that we're"
"11657000","11660620"," seeing from this AI rising tide lifting all boats. "
"11660920","11667940"," How much discussion is there, though, about protections having in place a sense of guardrails for"
"11667940","11668480"," this industry?"
"11668740","11669980"," Has that been a key topic at all?"
"11671560","11672380"," You know what?"
"11672640","11674740"," I would say this is more of a developer conference."
"11674740","11678080"," Well, that is close to the top of many people's mind here."
"11678200","11680980"," There was a little bit of that in the open AI session. "
"11680980","11685220"," They talked about building for the good of all humanity, which is, of course, the open AI mission,"
"11685460","11689880"," but kind of this is very a technologist conference, right?"
"11690140","11693980"," So a lot of developing here that are just optimistic and eager to start building."
"11694020","11700220"," I made the comparison to Apple's WWDC, right, when the App Store was becoming the behemoth and just"
"11700220","11702100"," this critical tool that it is now for developers."
"11702540","11703960"," That's sort of what's happening here. "
"11703960","11709420"," You see developers and companies from all different industries just focus on what is going to be"
"11709420","11712420"," the killer application or hardware or whatever it is."
"11712540","11717700"," But certainly in the background, there is sort of the ethical questions that many will have to"
"11717700","11719440"," confront and are confronting now."
"11720120","11721560"," All right, David, thank you very much. "
"11721620","11722200"," We appreciate it."
"11722420","11724240"," David Robosa reporting from California."
"11724240","11730620"," All right, Nvidia stock up today, pairing earlier losses as it's as investors seem to shrug off the"
"11730620","11732640"," launch of its new Blackwell GPU. "
"11733460","11738960"," Our next guest, too, is not convinced the chip will boost sales enough for the company to maintain"
"11738960","11739460"," growth."
"11739560","11745780"," His price target of $620 is the lowest on the street and is more than 30% below Nvidia's current"
"11745780","11746360"," price."
"11747000","11750500"," Let's welcome Gil Luria, senior software analyst at DA Davidson. "
"11750500","11751280"," Gil, welcome."
"11751480","11752160"," Good to have you with us."
"11753060","11758120"," Why do you think this stock could go from where it is today in the high 800s down to 620?"
"11758680","11759360"," What's the problem?"
"11761220","11763680"," I have a lot of cognitive dissonance around Nvidia. "
"11764520","11767100"," This year, they are going to have a fantastic year."
"11767280","11771280"," If you talk to their customers, then they really only have five big customers that represent more"
"11771280","11772700"," than two thirds of their revenue."
"11773220","11777580"," They'll tell you they're going to buy a lot more GPUs this year, whether the existing generation or"
"11777580","11777940"," the Blackwell. "
"11777940","11780040"," This year is going to be great."
"11780360","11784060"," That's why Nvidia can have so much confidence guiding one quarter at a time."
"11784760","11789700"," Our numbers for 2026, however, are lower than they are for this year. "
"11790420","11796800"," And if revenue peaks this year or next and starts declining from there, the stock won't be able to"
"11796800","11798240"," hold on to these multiples."
"11798380","11800360"," So these multiples right now make a lot of sense."
"11801000","11806060"," If you're just looking at this year and where that trajectory is, if you start looking at where we"
"11806060","11811160"," are going to be in a couple of years, it gets a lot trickier justifying these types of valuations. "
"11811180","11816480"," When you say 2026, are you talking about their fiscal year or the calendar year?"
"11816620","11821080"," In other words, is it two years until we start to see what you think will be a slowdown?"
"11822820","11828280"," The slowdown is probably going to start in the next four to six quarters, but it is two years from"
"11828280","11831380"," now that we expect revenue to be down."
"11831380","11837600"," While this generation of GPUs and the next generation of GPUs is the key to generating all this AI"
"11837600","11842840"," activity, which is why this has been such a celebration of AI at this conference."
"11843080","11845660"," The technology is moving very fast. "
"11845660","11847300"," I'll break some news for you."
"11847720","11855020"," Microsoft just released a research paper that says they think they can build a one bit LLM, which"
"11855020","11860740"," is to say they can build an LLM that is an order of magnitude more efficient."
"11860740","11867760"," What that means is we may be running inference on CPUs in a couple of years or on custom chips"
"11867760","11868700"," in a couple of years. "
"11869020","11870620"," These are not NVIDIA's markets."
"11871420","11875600"," And so if things are moving that fast and the direction they're headed is far more efficient"
"11875600","11876020"," models."
"11876640","11878140"," It's very hard to have visibility. "
"11878520","11886100"," So they may be able to build to build a large language model that operates on a simpler, less less"
"11886100","11889020"," NVIDIA dependent chip structure."
"11889760","11890260"," Exactly."
"11891100","11897780"," In fact, it's probably going to run on our device on a handset or a PC where NVIDIA's market shares"
"11897780","11901300"," far lower and the cost of the chips is far lower. "
"11901740","11903980"," And that's where we're going to really get the interesting tools."
"11904180","11909800"," You know, we talked about Apple, the distance between us where we are right now with Apple and"
"11909800","11916080"," Apple having a full on assistant in our phone is the ability to do inference on the phone on the"
"11916080","11916360"," handset."
"11916360","11918740"," And that's where the technology is headed. "
"11919240","11921940"," And NVIDIA's role in that world is much smaller."
"11922180","11926600"," So is that where you see the revenue decline stemming from competition not say manufacturing"
"11926600","11931420"," capacity macro economic forces like a potential recession."
"11932020","11934600"," It's purely this competition idea. "
"11935500","11937640"," It's purely talking to their customers."
"11937840","11942300"," If you listen to their customers, they'll tell you we're going to buy as many GPUs as we can this"
"11942300","11942560"," year."
"11942560","11946620"," We're going to stock up on them because we have a lot of demand for what they're doing for us"
"11946620","11947060"," right now. "
"11947500","11950960"," But going forward, we want to diversify away from NVIDIA."
"11951400","11953920"," We want to make our own chips that we can rely on."
"11954200","11959600"," And we're going to develop the technology, the LM engines and the general AI engines that require"
"11959600","11966540"," far less compute so we can do a lot more applications and do them at the edge on the device. "
"11966540","11973340"," Now, are these conversations taking place before this week's announcement before Blackwell or is it"
"11973340","11978940"," kind of expected with the new iteration of products that NVIDIA has been announcing?"
"11979980","11985380"," Now, these conversations have been happening because this is such a big exploding market and then"
"11985380","11989360"," videos customers are so large and have so many resources."
"11989360","11994040"," They've been working towards those goals for several months now."
"11994700","12001700"," And let's not forget that as far as they're concerned, if Blackwell can produce 500% more compute"
"12001700","12007080"," and cost only 50% more, they're going to get compute for a lot cheaper as well. "
"12007480","12012240"," So of course, they're happy with the new generation of products, but they're also working on making"
"12012240","12016020"," their models more efficient so they need less and less compute over time."
"12016020","12020840"," So let me come back to something that would occur to me and that is you just use the phrase,"
"12020840","12022460"," this is an exploding market."
"12022800","12029760"," There's just a hunger for NVIDIA's chips today and it is not merely, as you said, a huge percentage"
"12029760","12036000"," of their market is represented by five buyers, but there are lots of others who are either going to"
"12036000","12038500"," start buying or are coming on stream and presumably will buy. "
"12038500","12045860"," You believe that that sort of mega trend will be more than offset by some other changes in the"
"12045860","12050080"," dynamics of this market so their growth must therefore slow."
"12050780","12051300"," Am I understanding?"
"12051620","12052440"," Yes, yes."
"12052940","12058900"," Yeah, I'm so little Tyler, but beyond that, the five buyers that are buying these chips now are the"
"12058900","12059960"," five deepest pockets. "
"12059960","12066880"," The smaller companies and even individual governments don't have as much money as Amazon, Apple,"
"12067920","12068960"," Microsoft, Google and meta."
"12069440","12074580"," Those are very deep pockets and those are buyers that know they can get the return on investment"
"12074580","12080740"," right now because everybody's testing new AI tools and playing in the playground of developing"
"12080740","12081620"," these applications."
"12082160","12088600"," Once that activity settles down and we start getting on the more gradual ascent of generative AI,"
"12089280","12094720"," then the demand is going to fall for them and it's going to take a lot of other customers to"
"12094720","12099780"," replace that demand, which isn't to say that generative AI isn't going to be transformational and"
"12099780","12103980"," in a huge revolution in the biggest improvement of productivity since the Internet. "
"12104580","12108440"," It's just that that's going to take time and right now we're going through this phase of"
"12108440","12108720"," experimentation."
"12109840","12115000"," Once that's over and we get into a phase of more gradual building, we may not need as many."
"12115320","12120100"," There may not be as many customers and certainly not customers with as deep pockets as the ones"
"12120100","12121480"," that are stocking up right now. "
"12121480","12125160"," So I want to go back to your price target of 620 per share."
"12125400","12127300"," You see it's currently trading around 900."
"12127460","12131960"," So that represents significant downside, but you're telling investors to hold. "
"12131960","12137780"," So do you think that it's going to reach your price target in 12 months or is it something where"
"12137780","12142220"," you just kind of think investors are more prudent to hang on and see"
"12142220","12151460"," what happens."
"12151460","12151620"," So that's going to be a good idea."
"12151880","12155240"," They're going to exceed expectations next quarter and they're going to exceed expectations the"
"12155240","12156060"," quarter after that. "
"12156420","12161220"," That's why the current valuation makes sense if you're applying it to this year's earnings."
"12161800","12166480"," If you're looking at the two, three, five year timeframe, then you may be looking at an earnings"
"12166480","12172040"," number that's considerably smaller than what it's going to be this year, in which case, you're"
"12172040","12173680"," going to want to pay a much lower multiple."
"12173680","12178500"," So somewhere in the middle between those two timeframes is where we sit right now. "
"12178840","12181520"," And we obviously have to revisit that based on what we're learning."
"12181740","12183380"," Alright, Gill, you're giving us a lot to think about."
"12183460","12184580"," Gill, Luria, we thank you. "
"12184840","12185220"," Appreciate it."
"12185700","12185940"," Thank you."
"12186340","12191500"," And a quick programming note, Jim Kramer will sit down with Nvidia CEO Jensen Wong for an exclusive"
"12191500","12192860"," interview on Mad Money. "
"12193160","12193460"," That's tonight."
"12194060","12195520"," That's 6 p.m. Eastern time."
"12195700","12196460"," You don't want to miss that. "
"12196620","12198100"," That will be an intelligent conversation."
"12198640","12199040"," Absolutely."
"12199040","12204920"," And further ahead, the first major chip act award package said to be rolled out this week. "
"12205140","12210520"," But for the companies that won the big prize, how much did they spend on lobbying?"
"12210920","12214280"," We'll take a look at that ROI when power lunch returns."
"12393860","12398090"," Welcome back."
"12398310","12402810"," Gilden, active wearer is currently halted for news pending after a big jump. "
"12402930","12407350"," You see up 10% their session highs as Canada's Globe and Mail reports."
"12407610","12413090"," The apparel giant has put itself up for sale after receiving interest from private equity funds."
"12413830","12416770"," We've reached out to the company and will keep you updated as we know more. "
"12416770","12417630"," All right."
"12417690","12423970"," In the meantime, Bitcoin pulling back a bit today, trading at about 64,000 or 10,000 below the all "
"12423970","12426650","-time high, it hit just last week."
"12427290","12428290"," That means volatility. "
"12428770","12434330"," And now the cryptocurrency may be a key player in the Senate race in Ohio, which could pit a crypto"
"12434330","12434830"," bull."
"12435850","12439470"," Get that pit a bull pit bull versus a longtime crypto credit."
"12439610","12440370"," I don't know why they intended that. "
"12440650","12443370"," Emily Wilkins is in Ohio with more on the crypto candidates."
"12443850","12443930"," Emily."
"12445590","12446370"," Hey, Tyler. "
"12446690","12451090"," Well, yeah, I'm in Ohio, which is, of course, a key battleground state that could decide which"
"12451090","12452930"," party controls the Senate next year."
"12453310","12457290"," Now, the voters behind me are deciding which Republican is going to be going up against Democratic"
"12457290","12462310"," Senator Sherrod Brown, the head of the banking committee, who has pushed for restrictions on"
"12462310","12462610"," crypto."
"12463190","12469090"," And that has put him in the crosshairs of three crypto backpacks, which have raised 85 million. "
"12469090","12475150"," Now, this is from Coinbase from Ripple, Genami, Anderson Horowitz, and they're planning to play a"
"12475150","12477290"," big role in the 2024 election."
"12477950","12482950"," Now, these backs have yet to spend money in Ohio, but a Coinbase backed advocacy group called Stand"
"12482950","12485930"," With Crypto gave Sherrod Brown an F rating."
"12486490","12491130"," Meanwhile, one of the Republicans on the ballot today, tech executive and blockchain evangelist"
"12491130","12493070"," Bernie Moreno has an A rating. "
"12493070","12499110"," And if he wins today, he tells me that crypto will be on the ballot in the Ohio Senate race."
"12500410","12501410"," This will be an issue."
"12501850","12502570"," You mark right words. "
"12502710","12507290"," You talk about 1.2 million people that own crypto here in Ohio, and they look at a guy like"
"12507290","12510970"," Sherrod Brown, this tired career politician that thinks he knows best."
"12511330","12513850"," This will be an issue that we're going to use against him in this campaign."
"12516030","12520990"," Ohio's race will help determine whether Republicans control the Senate next year, and Brown is not"
"12520990","12524810"," the only Democrat in a key state who could be targeted by these crypto groups. "
"12525090","12529870"," Stand With Crypto has also given an F rating to Montana Senator John Tester, and Michigan"
"12529870","12534830"," Congresswoman Alyssa Slotkin, two other states that are going to be very critical in determining"

"12541570","12546850"," After the break, an under the radar stemming an industry play, paradigm down 5% for the year."
"12547070","12552110"," But with NVIDIA and AI transforming the chip space, could they be in a position to grow?"
"12552370","12553670"," We'll speak with the CEO next. "
"12556230","12593980"," Oh, shit."
"12594160","12598240"," They're going to come in here and take every single stop right now."
"12598400","12599060"," You watch this. "
"12601680","12604300"," They're going to take every single stop."
"12605820","12607840"," This is a computer right here."
"12607920","12608980"," It's hell 9,000. "
"12610300","12611500"," Sorry, I'm throwing up here."
"12613740","12617620"," They're going to take fucking, they're going to try to take every one of these stops right here."
"12617780","12621540"," I don't know if they're going to be successful, but they're trying right now. "
"12621920","12622520"," Well, not they."
"12623300","12624720"," How is trying right now?"
"12626320","12627860"," I'm fucking puked dude."
"12629600","12633880"," They're going to, like, they're going to, like, this whole hell 9,000 shit. "
"12633880","12635120"," This is the paint trade."
"12637120","12638020"," Big web here."
"12638180","12641340"," Now, this can lead to violence to the downside. "
"12643980","12647320"," But a lot of anger from bears at the same time."
"12648780","12650840"," The paint trade is right there."
"12651980","12655240"," Again, as said earlier, I'll say it to you again here. "
"12657100","12663620"," If you were a bear, then you want just a little bit of confirmation that we're actually rolling"
"12663620","12664140"," over."
"12664760","12667940"," You would want to see a breakdown below the five minute trigger."
"12669960","12670920"," A rejection. "
"12672280","12674300"," Blast down below the hourly trigger."
"12675340","12675840"," And then a rejection."
"12676480","12680360"," The moment you get that rejection, a new low, we are bearish. "
"12680800","12683480"," So we have not seen that as of yet."
"12683680","12686200"," Have not seen the roll down below the five minute trigger."
"12686460","12688860"," Have not seen the rejection and sell down to the hourly trigger. "
"12688860","12695800"," And a new low underneath the hourly trigger with the five minute trigger coming over and the one"
"12695800","12696860"," minute trigger coming over."
"12697160","12699540"," This leads to a three trigger cluster for bears."
"12700060","12702240"," Take this shit downtown of the daily trigger. "
"12703120","12704780"," We have not seen that yet."
"12705520","12706880"," Now can that happen?"
"12707080","12707180"," Sure."
"12707440","12708660"," I do want you to know here. "
"12709100","12715040"," I need to be very clear with you that if we do this bad shit up here, right, we go"
"12715040","12717080"," up there and mess with this hell 9,000 shit."
"12717760","12719100"," It's going to get bumpy."
"12722040","12724800"," So no whole account stuff, but. "
"12725760","12729940"," You know, like some cheap and you want to get involved in this there."
"12730140","12731320"," It's setting up right now."
"12731320","12733780"," As we discussed earlier this hour in video. "
"12733780","12738060"," It's set it's setting up right now for a it's setting up for."
"12739700","12741120"," Leave it at violence."
"12742940","12744460"," Most definitely violence. "
"12746260","12747580"," Creepy crawly up the wall."
"12748660","12750820"," But but stark reversal too."
"12751000","12754340"," Like you're in this like this is so this hell 9,000. "
"12754440","12757320"," This is R four and five."
"12758160","12760000"," These are RTX cells."
"12761760","12763780"," These are RTX cells on the upside. "
"12764880","12766320"," This whole red box here."
"12766500","12769340"," So it doesn't whatever day of the week it is doesn't really matter if we go up there."
"12769340","12770600"," It gets an auto cell. "
"12771440","12773160"," So there's violence here."
"12773540","12778000"," There's violence here and there's most definitely violence up here."
"12778400","12785760"," This is this is a massive pain trade and you're going to piss off some piss off some people if"
"12785760","12786340"," you go up there. "
"12787380","12788780"," Probably liquidity providers."
"12791100","12792940"," Piss off like Carl Eichen or something."
"12793160","12794060"," They'll be out there telling you. "
"12794180","12798620"," Be out there calling like the desk jockey saying sell five billion dollars right now."
"12799220","12802380"," The old Jim bros."
"12802440","12803860"," These are the pros right here. "
"12803980","12806020"," These are what the old Jim bros are pros."
"12806700","12811260"," This is where they come in to short the market on the regular to grab their cup of coffee."
"12811260","12814540"," They put the short on and they're good to go right. "
"12814720","12815760"," They don't care what you're going to do."
"12816600","12818540"," They don't care how high you're going to push it."
"12819160","12821700"," They're waiting for that roll back down either way. "
"12821860","12823400"," They're scared though right now."
"12823520","12825960"," These guys are these guys are stinky not that scared."
"12826700","12828860"," They're probably on Twitter right now. "
"12830100","12834360"," They're they're probably on Twitter right now and they're like they're on Twitter and they're like."
"12835060","12837100"," They're like god damn."
"12837660","12839660"," I don't know what they say like. "
"12841000","12843100"," I don't like the birds today."
"12843100","12845780"," I don't like."
"12846060","12848180"," I don't like the. "
"12849340","12851800"," I don't like what I don't like the sky being blue."
"12853280","12855160"," They're probably all salty right now."
"12855200","12856420"," These guys these are the old guys. "
"12856580","12858080"," They make a perfect trade every time."
"12859380","12864260"," So they're getting angry right now that we're back up here looking to take out their stops and"
"12864260","12865180"," that's where their stops are."
"12865600","12866880"," Their stops are right here. "
"12868220","12872480"," Right here and this is the one where they get pissed off."
"12873380","12875180"," That's how 9000 for the win."
"12876240","12877480"," Do I think we get a role here?"
"12877580","12877920"," Yeah, I do. "
"12878120","12880000"," I think we get a role regardless of."
"12881240","12884240"," Outcome whether we squeeze up here all the way up here."
"12884840","12888000"," There's a role there or a roll straight back down. "
"12888180","12888880"," You already got my take."
"12889060","12889400"," No changes."
"12890560","12891540"," Nothing's changed here. "
"12893000","12894040"," Absolutely nothing's changed."
"12895860","12896820"," Absolutely nothing's changed."
"12896820","12900080"," The old Jim bros I go with these guys right here every time. "
"12900740","12902560"," These guys are got their shorts on."
"12902840","12905600"," They're going to hopefully they're closing their laptops right now."
"12906100","12908660"," And they're going back down to their bunker. "
"12908960","12910520"," They have locked themselves up."
"12911060","12913820"," They've chained themselves to a wall somewhere."
"12914260","12917000"," They got their like they got the full wolf here coming out. "
"12919000","12921440"," Does this not look like consult?"
"12921760","12922240"," That's a good question."
"12922440","12923340"," Does this look like consult?"
"12923700","12924200"," That's a good question."
"12924200","12924720"," Hold on let's check. "
"12926220","12927140"," That's a good question actually."
"12927960","12930640"," Does this look like consolidation right now?"
"12931340","12931700"," No."
"12932280","12933480"," No it fucking doesn't. "
"12933940","12935800"," I'll say it again like I said it earlier."
"12937880","12939300"," I'll show it to you one more time."
"12939460","12941520"," I can see that some of you are here and some of you are not. "
"12941720","12942080"," That's fine."
"12943700","12945200"," I'll show it to you one more time."
"12946500","12947940"," It's a good question by the way. "
"12948000","12949140"," Does that look like consolidation?"
"12949720","12950200"," No it doesn't."
"12951220","12952320"," That's a great question."
"12952820","12957340"," So right up there you can see that that's a 51-91. "
"12958580","12959020"," Okay."
"12960320","12963880"," So again we're back to 520 on spy right?"
"12964100","12964780"," Think of that in your brain."
"12964980","12965800"," You're like okay I got five. "
"12965980","12968160"," Cap's got 520 as a big red box up there."
"12968840","12969220"," Right?"
"12969920","12971320"," You're gonna go back and forth really quick right?"
"12971440","12971940"," I'll go back and forth."
"12972160","12975420"," See you right there. "
"12976440","12978740"," 5-19-520 see all that up there."
"12979800","12982640"," Okay so on the bottom right screen right?"
"12984320","12986100"," We're gonna go back here and look at this okay?"
"12986820","12988640"," So does this look like consolidation to me?"
"12989140","12989440"," No."
"12989980","12991600"," It's a great question by the way. "
"12992260","12994360"," What you need to have here."
"12995080","12997280"," This is your local resistance right here right?"
"12998140","13001720"," You need to have the squeeze up right?"
"13001980","13006260"," So you get your squeeze up and then you need to consolidate."
"13006980","13008740"," Listen to me very closely. "
"13009000","13009980"," It's very important okay?"
"13010720","13011280"," Consolidate."
"13013060","13013620"," Consolidate."
"13015020","13016140"," Consolidate okay?"
"13017040","13017480"," That's it. "
"13017920","13018540"," That's all you're looking."
"13018740","13020180"," If you're a bull that's what you're looking for."
"13021240","13022940"," Now are you bullish there?"
"13023320","13024700"," The answer is still no. "
"13025040","13026840"," You still have a low probability of winning."
"13027740","13030580"," So it's like this whole move right here right?"
"13031400","13034940"," There's still a low probability of us going higher."
"13035700","13043600"," You need to have the first after the consolidation you need to break the prior high. "
"13044520","13045900"," And you will come back down."
"13046100","13047580"," I know you don't believe that but you will."
"13047900","13049120"," You will come back down. "
"13049780","13051760"," The hourly trigger will come up to you."
"13051940","13055280"," This is in yellow right now but if it was in green you would see the hourly."
"13056720","13057920"," You would see the hour. "
"13058200","13058740"," Wait a minute."
"13058880","13059460"," What's going on here?"
"13060540","13061680"," It's some funky shit going on."
"13062180","13063860"," You would see the hourly trigger come up. "
"13064480","13066320"," You would back test this successfully."
"13067320","13068700"," There's your squeeze higher."
"13069160","13070440"," There's your back test down. "
"13070800","13071320"," Confirmation."
"13071820","13077780"," And the moment that you get this pre-prior high this would be a trip that would last days, week,"
"13078140","13081840"," whatever to get to 5.30. Price before time."
"13082680","13083720"," Time could be a week. "
"13083920","13084320"," It could be a day."
"13085120","13085600"," It could be a month."
"13086440","13093240"," But this whole structure here you would need for the consolidation you're talking about to get to 5 "
"13093240","13094300",",300 up here. "
"13095400","13095640"," Okay."
"13096320","13101420"," So just so you might think in your brain right now you may be like, oh yeah, this is the"
"13101420","13102440"," biggest part of the trade."
"13102860","13103420"," But it isn't. "
"13103640","13107340"," It's actually the smallest part of the next stage of a trade."
"13108640","13109040"," So you consolidate."
"13109880","13110440"," Catch the new high. "
"13110840","13111460"," Come back down."
"13111900","13116980"," And then that would open up your 5.30. And this 5.20 to go up there."
"13117320","13118840"," This is where the money is by the way. "
"13119620","13121920"," This is where the volatility is right there."
"13122700","13123280"," Does that help?"
"13123500","13126020"," Hopefully, I think I've described it twice or three times to you."
"13126880","13131740"," So right now, right now, no, do I think we're consolidating?"
"13131880","13132580"," Absolutely fucking not. "
"13133420","13135400"," The only thing that we need to do."
"13136240","13138740"," Is to either in cash market."
"13139860","13142020"," Either in cash market or. "
"13143120","13144540"," Either in cash market."
"13145880","13147220"," Or in the overnight."
"13147220","13150300"," A lot of times you can't get this done. "
"13151660","13152620"," In cash market."
"13153300","13155280"," So you'll always hear about this happening."
"13155620","13159860"," Not always, but oftentimes they'll creepy crawly and up and wallie when you're not well paying"
"13159860","13161000"," attention in cash market. "
"13161820","13164300"," Or they'll do it in the after hours."
"13165500","13166800"," And they'll put it up."
"13166960","13169160"," They'll put price up there to see how it sits. "
"13170460","13172320"," So like they send us up there."
"13172700","13173680"," You can't get it done in cash."
"13173860","13174460"," You'll do it in overnight. "
"13174460","13177140"," They'll put us up here and they'll say to you."
"13177760","13178180"," All right."
"13179000","13179840"," We put the price. "
"13180020","13181880"," We put price where you think it should be."
"13182680","13183120"," Right."
"13185020","13186860"," We put the price where you think it should be. "
"13187080","13190280"," Now you guys have to buy a bunch of calls for not five thirty."
"13191080","13196580"," Give it by calls for five fifty and five sixty to get to five thirty."
"13197640","13198600"," Does that make sense?"
"13200060","13201980"," Hopefully it does make some sense to you. "
"13203680","13210300"," So we're in this next phase, but this next phase is like all of this work right here is to"
"13210300","13216260"," create a new level and some consolidation to trade by thirty five thirty five."
"13216700","13223000"," Now if you I can assume to out here that a lot of you don't get the pro the pro"
"13223000","13224140"," trader."
"13224620","13227180"," Subscription because if you have the pro trader subscription. "
"13228200","13229920"," You already know where I think we're going."
"13230560","13235100"," You already have the you already have the my targets."
"13235180","13238540"," You already know that I think five ninety six. "
"13239020","13241380"," You already know that I think in this run alone."
"13241380","13242860"," We get five thirty five."
"13243400","13248320"," You know that I think that we come back down off of five thirty five and then we get five"
"13248320","13249260"," fifty five sixty. "
"13249940","13254300"," And then you know that we come back down off five fifty five sixty and we get five ninety."
"13254880","13256980"," I'm not joking with those calls either."
"13256980","13258840"," Some of you don't pay for that. "
"13259020","13263860"," So I don't know exactly what to say to you about what I think or I don't think that kind"
"13263860","13264180"," of stuff."
"13264760","13266320"," If you think what I think over time."
"13269360","13271260"," I'm going back to the break right now again. "
"13272000","13276540"," I have to get off I have to get off because the more that I speak the more I want"
"13276540","13277100"," to throw up."
"13277800","13279440"," And I want to throw up pretty fucking bad."
"13280860","13283940"," Every time I'm talking it's like throw up throw up throw up. "
"13284960","13290400"," Now I'll be back with you here for a trade before four p.m. Give me a few minutes and"
"13290400","13291940"," I'm working on a trade for you right now."
"13292420","13295540"," And I'll be back with you guys with expectations for tomorrow."
"13295900","13296820"," Give me just five more minutes. "
"13364900","13366760"," My twitch is down right now. "
