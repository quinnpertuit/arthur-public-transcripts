"J16sNq5Aeac","736160","740680"," There's nothing of him of significance down here, and I'm gonna show you that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","741560","745060"," Another way at this moment, but I need you to understand that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","745600","747600"," there ain't shit and"

"J16sNq5Aeac","752280","754280"," Bulls, okay. Do you know what I'm saying?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","755760","761200"," Bears are getting scared and closing there that this market down below is small. So"
"J16sNq5Aeac","761680","763680"," What does that mean for you?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","764760","768920"," Means that you need to pay very close attention"
"J16sNq5Aeac","770120","774560"," To these levels right here very important that you pay attention to this"
"J16sNq5Aeac","775400","781400"," Hold on. That's not a that's not an arrow very important that you pay attention to this because this is the floor"
"J16sNq5Aeac","781840","783840"," And this is the only floor"
"J16sNq5Aeac","784440","792320"," For SPX so it is concerning not huge concern, but it is concerning you see them buying all this up here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","792320","795400"," We could easily break right through this. It's nothing"
"J16sNq5Aeac","796280","800760"," Right, but I want you to know that if you're a bull or a bear that you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","800760","806160"," This is the buy zone down here, and they're a shit down below. Okay now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","807000","809980"," Conversely what is happening on the upside?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","811000","811880"," and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","811880","814960"," There is market expansion to the upside"
"J16sNq5Aeac","816800","818800"," They've got 4650 up here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","822240","824440"," Right let's take a look to the upside we've got"
"J16sNq5Aeac","826360","829440"," 4700 up here and that's a"
"J16sNq5Aeac","830320","837040"," 106 million and then we've got 63 million at 4750"
"J16sNq5Aeac","837640","844200"," So there's a lot of space up here right a lot of market up here. That's unchanged and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","844840","850360"," You know this market right now is focused on that upside, but this down here, man. This scare"
"J16sNq5Aeac","850360","857280"," It doesn't quite scare me. I just don't like this gamma picture for the market where this is it right here, so"
"J16sNq5Aeac","858280","860280"," If you're a bull I"
"J16sNq5Aeac","861480","868720"," Would say to you to mark these levels down snip this page and keep your focus down here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","868720","875160"," Okay, be patient and look for those dip buys down here to buy for these explosive moves"
"J16sNq5Aeac","875440","881360"," This this this picture has changed each day as well. So all this stuff is moved up and down and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","882080","884080"," And"
"J16sNq5Aeac","884080","888040"," So we're buying these gamma levels, but today's gamma levels"
"J16sNq5Aeac","888400","892720"," We're let's see. It's just today's gamma levels where what I want to buy this"
"J16sNq5Aeac","893520","896800"," Probably not right here. I probably don't want to buy this right here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","896800","902200"," I probably want to buy it down here with stops underneath and if we begin to reject below here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","902200","904200"," I can stop myself out right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","904280","910760"," This is where I'm buying my dips and I'm putting some stops down here and let's say a bear or a seller or a"
"J16sNq5Aeac","911040","912640"," Whoever out there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","912640","917840"," sells us underneath this and starts to reject for another downside move sure I'll switch around and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","918120","922080"," We'll ride this bad book this bad boy and this bad puppy down to the downside, but until then"
"J16sNq5Aeac","922600","928680"," This is where I want to buy. It's the Greek the greed setting and this is where if I had a choice"
"J16sNq5Aeac","928680","933040"," I would buy this right here like if I was to say to myself, yeah, I'm gonna you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","933040","937800"," Not give all my money back to the market and I'm looking for that dip now if we start heading higher here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","938160","942840"," Right. Hey cap. We're gonna leave you behind we get above the hourly trigger then so be it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","942840","945560"," And we'll run that up right we talked about that past two weeks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","945680","949360"," We'll trade this market up as far as they want to go as high as they want to go and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","949920","955080"," We'll start getting bearish down below here and so on and so forth if things turn that way"
"J16sNq5Aeac","956600","957680"," So"
"J16sNq5Aeac","957680","962040"," We got that out of the way right we're gonna now go back to spy"
"J16sNq5Aeac","962160","965840"," We're gonna look at a IWM as well at some point and cues"
"J16sNq5Aeac","966640","970240"," So we're gonna look at spy really quick. We're gonna go to a boy. I'm in the wrong chart here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","978840","982000"," Switch over and just see this right here if you are a bull"

"J16sNq5Aeac","3626000","3630560"," Right and price not following to the upside. So"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3631440","3635840"," Uh, the key point here would be you see these series of lower"

"J16sNq5Aeac","3660400","3666160"," Where if we were not coming into their earnings report, I would expect an explosive move to the upside"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3667120","3670800"," These earnings earnings reports is when dealers, right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3671600","3673440"," can"

"J16sNq5Aeac","3690560","3694000"," Would not be shocked to see dealers fuck you"

"J16sNq5Aeac","3710400","3713200"," Everything is improving even though price is telling you no"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3714240","3718000"," Right, so that actually that it's like a counterintuitive thing. It's um"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3718640","3720640"," A divergence that's bullish"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3721120","3727600"," So you're like i'm buying this oh god i'm in so much pain, but the reality is you are looking for this explosive upside move"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3728560","3732000"," In chewy, so price right now it's parked on its daily trigger"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3733520","3735040"," Currently, right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3735040","3739440"," You are setting up right now. There's a few things you're looking for you're being rejected here in the daily"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3739920","3743760"," Uh, but you are looking for the support of the hourly trigger, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3743840","3750000"," And you're looking for successful back tests and successful upside look look backs that are bullish, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3750000","3757040"," So whatever that squeeze is right want to just keep holding that keep holding that and create that four trigger bull cluster to the upside, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3757600","3759600"," But we do have again earnings"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3759680","3765200"," Uh that can go against that thesis and all of this beautiful structure right here. So this is what i'm going to say to you"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3765680","3768080"," um 13.8 percent right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3768800","3770800"," expected move 13 8 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3771200","3773200"," Let's see how much of a move that is"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3774400","3776960"," Uh from current price that's 7 percent right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3780880","3785120"," This is uh 13 percent right 13 30 down here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3788000","3791280"," Right, so we're going to snap a little box down here and if you're a greedy bull"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3792800","3795760"," What are you looking for you're a greedy pig bull"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3796640","3801200"," You want that move down here, don't you right you want that move you want a panic"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3802560","3805600"," You want to see like a panic you want being fuck other bulls, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3806240","3811440"," Uh they're up here and they're all bullish and you get this opportunity to buy that dip and just moon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3812080","3816720"," Right, so that's where i am on chewy is down here. Okay, that's where i am"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3817520","3823600"," If you are not there on chewy dealers are down here too. They're like yeah, fuck all these bulls right then we make the move later"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3824560","3827680"," If you are not that person you're like, hey cap, fuck you. I'm bullish"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3828480","3833600"," Uh, i'm going to tell you that keep buying the hourly trigger. That's 18.75"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3834400","3836400"," Right for that upside target"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3836720","3840800"," So anything like this that you can buy to stay on trend. That's your spot. Okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3842720","3847040"," That's where most people are going to be buying they come down here buy this and they're trying to get those upside targets"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3847680","3854320"," And we have the other 13 percent or so expected move to the upside up here. I think it's 13 and a half something like that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3855120","3858720"," Right there. Right. So here's your target to the upside right here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","3861440","3863440"," That's your red"

"J16sNq5Aeac","7271600","7273600"," Today with its Gemini announcement"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7273840","7278400"," TPU 5 the new version of it that's going to train its newest multi-modal model"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7278720","7281440"," So I actually think that we are seeing a new"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7282080","7289680"," Era for the semiconductor space and there will be a lot of collaboration between the big chip makers in intel and AMD and NVIDIA and all these hyperscalers"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7289760","7291760"," No aunts having said that though"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7291760","7295360"," They're vertically integrating and we've seen it be successful at apple in their business"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7295360","7297840"," And we're going to see it be successful at AWS and microsoft as well"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7298400","7305040"," Cristina I just want to go back to kind of what's been going on regulatory wise where jeeter amanda reportedly has been very tough"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7305120","7309840"," Maybe without quite naming them on NVIDIA or companies who are kind of really"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7310400","7314960"," Getting around any restrictions the us is trying to impose on these sending these these chips to china"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7315520","7318160"," How do we expect NVIDIA AMD to continue?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7318480","7321040"," Is it an opportunity for AMD to maybe be friendlier?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7321040","7325520"," Do they both need to just be super clever here to keep is big a market share as possible?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7326080","7331040"," I'm just how much is that a factor as we look at some of their forward sales projections"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7332640","7338160"," It's more of a factor for NVIDIA given that they get roughly 20 to 25 percent of their data center revenue from china"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7338160","7342160"," That's why NVIDIA was very quick to create a workaround chip for china"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7342320","7344720"," And that's where that threat came from jina ramando"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7344720","7346560"," However, having said that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7346560","7351680"," NVIDIA knows that they're not going to get that chip block just right away the government has to follow a protocol"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7352160","7358240"," Jensen Wong took to the stage in singapore early early this morning saying that they are working closely with the us government"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7358560","7364320"," So going forward I can only assume there's going to be more restrictions for a lot of these chips"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7364320","7368160"," So companies need to be cautious and maybe start pivoting their attention elsewhere"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7368240","7372640"," So AMD we're not expecting any comments specifically about china on stage"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7372800","7379280"," That's just because their market is smaller than in videos. However, NVIDIA did say that there would be a significant"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7380080","7384000"," Impact in their q4 revenue. So that's something to keep a note for in video"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7384080","7387520"," But daniel brought up a really interesting point to just about the market share"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7387520","7391680"," I think the big conversation here today is the fact that the market is still really big"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7391840","7395120"," NVIDIA has a stronghold right now AMD is slowly coming in"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7395360","7399680"," There's still room for both players. So for investors, they're looking like which stock should I buy?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7399760","7405600"," There's still an opportunity especially because AMD would play more in the inferencing world of the large language model"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7405600","7411360"," But in the future that's where I get a little concerned when you have all of this competition from the hyperscalers coming in"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7411920","7414560"," Oh, yeah, the hyperscalers are going to play a really significant role"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7414640","7418000"," They're going to be playing the part of building the software stacks top to bottom"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7418000","7424320"," But you can see I mean microsoft is here today oracle was here today as a hyperscaler talking about how they're going to be deploying deploying the"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7425200","7427040"," They are working on their own stuff"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7427040","7430320"," But exactly for the reason you and I talked about it's because the market is so big"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7430320","7435920"," They're going to address everything from power consumption requirements to cost requirements people need different silicon for different workloads"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7435920","7438560"," And that's a smart company is going to address all those different needs"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7439440","7443840"," All right, we thank you both very much. Daniel Newman Christina parts the nevelus on a big afternoon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7443840","7445360"," Wouldn't you say john for AMD?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7445360","7446320"," Uh, yes indeed"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7446320","7450000"," And it can going to continue to get bigger christina's coming back with"

"J16sNq5Aeac","7481280","7487760"," Many use their prepared testimonies as a chance to highlight what they see are the pitfalls and republican lawmakers prodded"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7487760","7494720"," The issue further by asking the executives how basil might impact main street. Here's goldman sacks the ceo david sulliman"

"J16sNq5Aeac","7504880","7510480"," Um, I think is ultimately punitive to economic growth and doesn't strike the right cost benefit analysis"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7510880","7514400"," We of course need to make the system secure. The system is in good shape"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7514400","7518080"," We've seen that under stress that doesn't mean there aren't things that can be done at the margin"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7518240","7522080"," But this is a wholesale change that leads to um that leads to problems"

"J16sNq5Aeac","7547680","7551040"," I've always been deeply opposed to crypto bitcoin etc"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7551360","7557600"," You pointed out the only true use case for it is criminals drug traffickers anti-money learning tax avoidance"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7557760","7559280"," And that is a use case"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7559280","7562960"," Uh because it is somewhat anonymous not fully and because you can move money"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7563280","7568560"," Instantaneously and because it doesn't go through as you mentioned all these systems have built up over many years"

"J16sNq5Aeac","7603360","7608800"," No, I mean tangentially he said in the past that he supports blockchain in particular, but he's also called"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7609520","7612960"," Called bitcoin a pet rocker or has no value"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7613680","7619760"," Other than essentially being a pet rock so today's comment saying if he were the government he would shut it down kind of echo previous"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7620400","7625840"," You know less favorable. Shall we say a sentiment that jamey diamond in particular has had"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7626720","7629680"," With crypto so no not not a major"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7630480","7636000"," At any kind of business for them whatsoever. Yeah, I know he's been pretty clear. I think warren asked the wrong wrong person"

"J16sNq5Aeac","7843680","7848960"," This is really the crux of things because those who think earnings are looking good for next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7849440","7854960"," Can kind of shrug off everything else to happening and and say it's time to embrace it and then others aren't so sure"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7855120","7857120"," Uh, so you have some confidence here or no"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7857840","7861120"," Well kelly, I think it's interesting as you said earlier this year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7861200","7864640"," It was all about beating very low expectations when it came to earnings"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7864720","7870000"," So we have this earnings recession yet markets rallied anyway because results were much better than anticipated"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7870400","7873040"," So my concern is the setup for 2024"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7873520","7878160"," Is that now we're expecting earnings growth for s&p 500 companies of more than 11?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7878960","7882320"," So I do think that the risk of disappointment has grown"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7882880","7885040"," Even though earnings are likely to be pretty good"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7885440","7891280"," I'm not sure they're going to live up to those higher expectations and how the market reacts to that does concern"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7892080","7894560"," Michael is 24 finally good of the year for bonds"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7895840","7897200"," I'm not so sure"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7897200","7900000"," Uh, I do think that bonds are more attractive john"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7900080","7902800"," So when we look at kind of the yield that you're receiving"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7903200","7906480"," For the interest rate risk that you're taking that duration that you're taking"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7906720","7909840"," It's more in balance than it has been since 2009"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7910320","7913360"," So there is a much more attractive picture for bonds"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7913840","7916800"," But we still see most investors barbell"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7917200","7921920"," So very conservative on the short end of the curve with treasury bills and short majorities"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7922640","7927760"," While balancing that a little bit with things like investment-free corporate bonds for example"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7928080","7931680"," Where i'm taking on a little bit more credit risk a little bit more interest rate risk"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7932160","7934160"," But i'm not taking on too much"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7934480","7941120"," And yet those yields are commensurate or similar to what's on the short side of the of the fixed income portfolio"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7941440","7947200"," So that seems to be the right kind of balance if you will for fixed income allocations as we head to 2024"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7947360","7953280"," How much danger is there though for the retail investor in watching the price of bonds themselves"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7953840","7959520"," Too closely and not thinking long term about the yields because so many retail investors have"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7960320","7967360"," Tilted much more toward stocks toward equities over the past couple of decades and are way out of that traditional balance"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7968720","7974960"," It's true, but they've been rewarded at least over the long term for taking on that additional equity risk"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7975280","7979760"," And you think that the setup is for that to continue over the longer term"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7980080","7983680"," But john you're right in terms of the opportunity for bonds"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7983760","7988160"," It's certainly more compelling now than it was over the last decade or so"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7988640","7992240"," In terms of you know in terms of income and total return"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7992640","7995520"," So we are seeing fixed income allocations creep up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7995760","7998720"," I think one of the more interesting things is that when"
"J16sNq5Aeac","7999200","8005680"," Income was scarce it forced investors to take a lot of risk and fixed income that they may or may not have been comfortable with"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8006240","8008240"," Now with income more plentiful"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8008640","8010640"," The allocations to fix income"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8010720","8012720"," Continue to remain challenging"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8013200","8018320"," Most folks have gotten that interest rate call wrong this year as rates continue to back up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8018720","8024320"," That's why we think stable income is kind of the way to go and that balance that barbell"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8024640","8032320"," Between kind of conservative fixed income on the short end and to your point adding some maturities adding some fixed income"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8033040","8035920"," In terms of the intermediate part of the curve we think make some sense"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8036240","8041520"," Still amazing to look at 411 there on the 10 year and how far it's fallen in such a very quick period of time"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8041920","8046080"," So you're you're interested in in hedging against a lot of these risks with gold"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8046240","8054480"," So the the outperformance of gold lately is that partly what's driving your interest or does that kind of make logical sense to you and you think it keeps going"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8055200","8061920"," I think what's been fascinating about gold this year kelly is that interest rates have climbed certainly they're off of their highs"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8062160","8066400"," Since the end of october, but interest rates are up kind of this year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8066960","8071680"," The dollar has strengthened somewhat unexpectedly this year up again up until recently"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8072000","8077040"," These are two traditional headwinds for gold yet the spot price of gold is up in the teens"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8077600","8084240"," So it's overcome those headwinds and now all of a sudden yields are falling as you point out on 10 year treasury yields"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8084560","8089040"," The dollar is likely to weaken particularly as the fed ends its tightening cycle"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8089200","8095280"," That's starting to happen and now you all of a sudden have a much more attractive backdrop for gold"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8095680","8101120"," At a time when the outcomes across a wide range of things are wider than normal"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8101120","8106080"," Geopolitical risks the economy the fed inflation earnings like we talked about up front"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8106320","8110560"," So we think hedging a lot of these risks with a small gold allocation makes sense"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8110960","8117440"," In 2022 spot price of gold was flat while stocks and bonds were down this year golds remain competitive with stocks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8117840","8122960"," Even though they're up to considerably we think the backdrop remains attractive in 2024"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8123840","8125840"," All right, michael eroni. Thank you"

"J16sNq5Aeac","8343600","8348160"," You can see we have definitely seen a drop in job creation"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8348320","8354880"," And i fully suspect we'll see the same thing from the bureau labor statistics on the big november jobs report on friday"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8354880","8360240"," That as you reference will include government hiring. Let's look at twos and tens on one chart"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8360320","8364320"," Shall we you know at 815 easter when that day to hit and by the way"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8365200","8369600"," 103 000 is the second smallest job creation amount in adp"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8370080","8374640"," Going all the way back. Yes all the way back to the july excuse me"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8375360","8375840"," uh"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8375840","8381520"," Second lowest since july 21 and two-year no yields made their lows right on that number"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8381680","8386960"," But look at 10 year how it keeps going lower and when you expand the charts to a two-day chart"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8387120","8389920"," It really jumps out at you how much the curve has been"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8390720","8397680"," Reinverting even right now at a 459 yield on twos were basically near on changed up a basis point"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8397840","8403040"," Whereas tens hovering it for 12 or down five basis points this dynamic"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8403280","8410480"," Really finally is reflecting the slowing of the us economy and many have talked about the dollar index"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8410560","8415200"," Have you looked at it lately? It's basically near unchanged on the year and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8416000","8421600"," European yields on twos and tens they're lower on the year than they were at the end of last year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8421840","8426960"," Our yields are approaching those settlements, but still a bit higher as the world handicaps"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8427280","8432880"," How small a growth swap down we're going to see for 2024"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8433120","8438000"," Kelly back to you rick. Thank you very much bigger move today might be the price of oil"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8438560","8443440"," Below 70 dollars for the first time since june pippa stevens has more on this big drop"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8443760","8447200"," Yeah, we're not below 70 and there's just really nothing to like here in this market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8447200","8450560"," We did get the latest inventory report which showed a draw on us stockpiles"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8450720","8456880"," But the market is overlooking that and of course there's just not a lot of belief in opac and its allizability to cut their output"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8456880","8462720"," With those voluntary cuts officials in both saturday rayby on russia came out trying to kind of assure the market that it's going to happen"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8463040","8469760"," But it's broke rich pvm put it. It's basically just fallen on deaf ears saturday rayby also cut its official selling prices for all grades"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8469760","8473280"," Of its crude starting in january, which once again is pointing to weak demand"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8473440","8478720"," And so today is not a good day if you're an energy company to announce an update with oil falling below 70"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8478720","8482240"," But of course xon did this morning and that stock is lower"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8482480","8487680"," So a couple of things there they did increase their buyback to 20 billion next year up from 17 and a half billion"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8488160","8493040"," Per year once the deal with pioneer closes, but they also raised their capital spending"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8493040","8495200"," So this year and next year it's pretty steady"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8495200","8499600"," We have a chart showing that you can see it is still well below the pre-covid era"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8499840","8504720"," But looking forward in 2025 they expect the range to be as high as 27 billion"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8505120","8510240"," Now a lot of that is thanks to an increase in spending for their low carbon solutions business"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8510560","8513440"," They bumped that up from 17 billion to 20 billion"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8513760","8518000"," And the street just really does not believe that that's going to be profitable for xon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8518400","8518880"," rbc"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8518880","8526880"," They said they have to convince investors on the merits of the low carbon spending jpm said the market is skeptical of returns on low capital"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8526880","8530240"," Investment so it does seem to be that that's hitting the stock here. Well"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8531120","8535440"," And I mean you could say if anything that that xon's outperforming crude, you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8535440","8539200"," It could be and maybe that's what all of those moves they're taking underline"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8539360","8542640"," That's the other thing that you know, energy was the top sector for the last two years"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8542640","8545600"," And no sector has ever been the best sector for three straight years"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8545920","8550400"," And so if you did very well in the stock you are probably going to be taking taking some profits there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8550400","8552320"," They're still paying a very healthy dividend"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8552320","8556400"," They're buying backstock and also their expectations for both the pioneer and the denberry"

"J16sNq5Aeac","8558480","8562880"," So they still have some wiggle room before they have to meaningfully revise any estimates great point"

"J16sNq5Aeac","8867120","8873360"," Group of mechanics in sweden who are asking tesla to recognize their right to organize as a union"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8873520","8880160"," They're not even getting to the part where demands are are part of what they're asking from tesla tesla is not even acknowledging that at this point"

"J16sNq5Aeac","8897600","8905040"," Transport workers who are saying later this month they may stop transporting tesla models to sweden now look in the whole grand scheme of things"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8905360","8907120"," Those are two very small markets"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8907520","8911760"," They're important markets in europe, but they're still very small in terms of volume"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8911920","8918000"," But this could blow up into a bigger issue john because tesla has the only non-union final assembly plant"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8918240","8921360"," It's in germany and there's no sense that it's going to organize"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8921760","8927200"," Soon, but if this continues to mushroom and it gets more and more support from other labor unions"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8927840","8931520"," You know how this could go how does it not go there in skid maybe"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8931520","8933520"," Yeah"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8933600","8940560"," Well, look one way is that tesla could say to the mechanics in sweden. Okay. We recognize your right to organize"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8940800","8948640"," Now elan musk has been clear. He does not believe that labor unions are in the best interest of the company nor in the best interest"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8948640","8955280"," Is one of the workers he points out that tesla has given their workers better pay through stock options, etc"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8955840","8958480"," And that there's no reason to be a part of a union"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8958720","8961920"," So it let's say they do recognize that the mechanics in sweden"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8962080","8964560"," This could all blow over and and that could be the end of it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8964880","8970480"," The flip side of this is that if they don't recognize that the the right of that union to organize"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8971040","8975440"," What you see in norway could happen in other countries and then it starts to spread from there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8975840","8980640"," How big of a blow would it be if parts or all of it's german workforce unionized"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8981200","8983200"," It"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8983200","8988080"," Depends you know ultimately they would be look they're not going to be uncompetitive"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8988640","8995120"," But elan musk believes that a unionized workforce is not as competitive and not as helpful to the bottom line"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8995520","8998000"," As what they currently have in germany"
"J16sNq5Aeac","8998240","9003280"," So if they organize and then they have to negotiate a contract and the costs go up from there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9003440","9010240"," Well, then tesla could argue look we are not as competitive within a market that by the way guys is becoming brutally competitive"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9010720","9015680"," In terms of electric vehicles as the chinese evs are starting to flood into that market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9015920","9019360"," And that's really changing the dynamic in terms of electric vehicles"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9019520","9021520"," This might be a ridiculous question, but"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9021920","9025200"," Sometimes I wonder why would musk run such a high risk in the first place"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9025600","9032240"," Of putting the gigafactory in germany which has historically had you know stronger labor unions or at least europe more broadly"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9033680","9037040"," Well europe overall they're the only non you look anywhere in europe"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9037200","9042800"," He was going to run into this issue eventually because all auto plants are unionized in in europe"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9043120","9048160"," So it's not that he could have avoided this by putting the plant in a different country other than germany"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9048320","9052080"," And look germany is the largest auto market in europe"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9052560","9056240"," Evs are growing very quickly there. Yeah, this the the"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9057120","9064640"," Gigafactory outside of berlin has been very successful for tesla. It was a smart move for elan musk and tesla to put a plant there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9065520","9070640"," Eventually everybody knew that this is one of those situations that might ultimately develop"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9071200","9072880"," Yeah, and here we are"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9072880","9077440"," Perhaps at the beginning of it and perhaps not depends on how the the skin denavian things go"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9077440","9080720"," I suppose phil for now. Thank you very much our philoboe reporting"

"J16sNq5Aeac","9085920","9089040"," As with previous rallies it seems that everyone wants a piece"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9089360","9092960"," Bob bisonney joins us with a look at how people are trying to get in on the action"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9093440","9097520"," But first let's begin with kate runi for more on what's driving this rally kate"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9098000","9102640"," Hey kelly, so it's been a lot of excitement around a bitcoin ETF or a spot ETF"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9102720","9106240"," It would track the actual price of bitcoin versus the futures price"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9106560","9109520"," There has been a lot of hype a lot of speculation that the scc"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9109840","9114160"," It's going to prove this there's nine or so applications out there from everyone from black rock to fidelity"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9114240","9118080"," So the excitement here is around the biggest asset managers in the world getting involved"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9118160","9121200"," So it's seen as this stamp of legitimacy and stamp of approval"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9121280","9126240"," And then it would also theoretically expand access to cryptocurrency's bitcoin in particular"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9126240","9131680"," And then there's another dynamic so that kind of let lit the fuse kelly and that's what got some of the price"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9132240","9138720"," movements above you know 30,000 for example, but then there's another dynamic here, which is leverage so especially in these markets in Asia"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9139040","9144400"," I'm told you get what amounts to sort of a short squeeze people had bet against bitcoin in this case"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9144640","9148560"," Then you see these massive liquidations and these massive positions get wiped out"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9148880","9151840"," That is most likely what we're seeing in the last couple weeks or so"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9151840","9157520"," You saw the price climbing to 40,000 and then just this massive spike to almost 45,000"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9157520","9161440"," So that is more likely one of these big what you would call whales in these markets"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9162000","9164480"," Liquidating a position versus just retail interest"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9164480","9171120"," So you saw about 90 million dollars for example of liquidations yesterday alone that indicates that it's some of the the bigger"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9171920","9176720"," Institutional players in these markets versus retail interest, which has still been pretty muted"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9176960","9179360"," It's risen you know in the last month or so, but it's still"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9180240","9185600"," Far below what we saw in the the height of 2021 and even last year kelly. Yeah, all right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9186240","9188240"," Thanks kate now bob. How do you see it?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9188560","9190080"," Well, look"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9190080","9191520"," Number one"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9191520","9196080"," There's no doubt that interest in a bitcoin ETF is what's driving these right now up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9196560","9204080"," Here's the problem. We have seen this phenomenon before so for example companies going in the s&p 500 their prices often go up in anticipation"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9204480","9208480"," They're they're going in whenever you have the idea that there might be an expansive new market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9208640","9211760"," People tend to try to front run the price and move it up a little bit"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9212160","9216880"," We saw this with ETFs as cyber security ETFs were hot four or five years ago"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9217120","9221360"," They drove up the price of cyber security stocks and subsequently underperformed"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9221360","9224320"," So I'm wondering whether or not they're sort of now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9224960","9229040"," This is the demand phase of this and we'll see what happens once the bitcoin ETF and I agree with kate"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9229040","9231680"," It's probably inevitable. We'll get a bitcoin ETF"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9231840","9234960"," What's happening here that's interesting is if you look at grayscale"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9235280","9242080"," They have funds out there that are essentially closed end funds that are trading at premiums and discounts to various crypto assets"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9242080","9248880"," That's been trading at a discount to bitcoin recently, but what's interesting here is that there's only a very limited amount of"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9249920","9254080"," Bitcoin in these funds here the in the bitcoin fund itself 640,000"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9254160","9257840"," They don't change that number and so people who are piling into that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9258160","9262880"," The the price has to change but the trades at a discount or a premium to bitcoin"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9262880","9265680"," And this is the problem with some of these funds that are out there right now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9265680","9272800"," Why you want to have a bitcoin ETF because if you have one then you can adjust how much bitcoin you actually have in the fund and have it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9272800","9274800"," Track the price of bitcoin"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9274960","9280480"," Accurately and that's a if there's any reason to finally figure out a way to get this bitcoin ETF going"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9280480","9286720"," It's to eliminate these problems with discounts and premiums for some of these closed end type funds that exist out there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9287200","9291360"," Real quickly k we also see shares of robin hood popping so this seems to be a"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9292240","9293440"," Again"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9293440","9298000"," Back to the future. It's 2021 all over again. Anytime bitcoin coins up robin hoods up too"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9298560","9299840"," Yeah, it feels that way kelly"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9299840","9304320"," So one of the things that's helping robin hood they had a disclosure this week that showed 75"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9304400","9308000"," Percent volume growth in terms of a crypto volume at least on their platform"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9308000","9314400"," One of the things analysts are pointing out is that something like a bitcoin ETF would disproportionately benefit robin hood"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9314400","9319040"," They've got that younger group of traders. They've got this crypto offering and they've got equities alongside that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9319280","9323920"," So if there's a bitcoin ETF you got to trade it on a platform or brokerage platform versus a coin base"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9324000","9329440"," For example, if you compare those two charts robin hoods been up about 9% today mazuho estimated that coin base"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9329520","9334560"," Yes, they've seen some trading volume growth, but it's only around 60 versus 75"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9335040","9339920"," From robin hood and coin base is listed on a partner here as sort of the custody provider"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9340000","9344080"," But anything that would threaten their trading volume anything that would threaten threaten"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9344480","9350720"," That retail trading that they get about 3% of a fee on that is not seen as good news for coin base"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9350720","9356000"," So shares pretty much flat there but robin hood getting and remember robin who gets paid on payment for order flow"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9356000","9363440"," So they would benefit because these would shape these ETFs would trade on exchange obviously great point. All right, bob kate. Thank you"

"J16sNq5Aeac","9640960","9644000"," You know impact it's the two biggest things that we're hearing are"

"J16sNq5Aeac","9946480","9949600"," And let's start with campbell soup. They had lower sales and profit last quarter"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9949600","9956560"," But the shares are up nicely today. The company said they may outpace estimates for 2024 earnings per share. What would you do with the stock?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9958400","9964000"," Yeah, hi coe I think this is a stock today that's getting a little bit of a bounce because the price increases"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9964640","9967760"," That campbells pass through improve profitability"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9968000","9972880"," But this is one I think i'm a little bit skeptical about because when we dig into the quality of earnings"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9973200","9978720"," We've seen that volumes were down about 5% because because consumers were sensitive to price"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9979200","9985680"," And also the company is increasing its marketing efforts to capture share which gives us some pause regarding the"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9986320","9989600"," Concerns about profitability moving forward and maintaining these levels"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9990000","9994000"," So I think there might be some better opportunities outside of campbell soup right now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","9994480","10002080"," Well, maybe told brothers shares are higher on a q4 earnings and revenue beat the home builder forecasts solid demand for next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10002160","10008400"," It's encouraged by lower mortgage rates. So can you buy it or is consumer demand just too uncertain?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10010000","10013680"," Yeah, john, unfortunately, I think there's still a lot of uncertainties in this space"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10014240","10020400"," Uh, so we're a little bearish on this one as well. So at least in the short term soon you think about the the push pull between"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10020720","10024560"," Demand and supply. We know told brothers brings luxury homes to market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10025200","10029840"," At at a pretty reasonable price point, but we know construction costs are higher"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10030400","10035280"," But we also know consumers household savings have dwindled and at the same point in time"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10035920","10042320"," Are very fickle on mortgage rates. So we know rates take down today, which is boosting the stock and some of these expectations"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10042560","10047440"," But we still think there's a lot of uncertainty regarding rates next year and and consumer spending"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10047600","10050880"," So I think there's better opportunities john outside of home builder sector"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10051840","10055280"," And the shares have doubled pretty much this year already. So that's an interesting one. All right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10055280","10058480"," Let's move along to sentinel one then having I think it's best of day ever"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10058480","10066320"," It's soaring after its earnings top estimates. They raise their annual revenue forecasts on robust cybersecurity spending 17 percent pop here"

"J16sNq5Aeac","10073120","10078720"," Uh, this is actually a sector that we like in the cyber security space and sentinel has a very competitive"

"J16sNq5Aeac","10082080","10087440"," Primarily on enterprises and businesses while it's still trying to increase its penetration to the consumer"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10087760","10094800"," And as you mentioned the dynamics of earnings today. We're really encouraging. We actually saw the margins improve 8 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10095280","10099520"," Um year over year reaching a new company record of 79"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10100000","10106640"," Uh, and I think that's a favorable sign moving forward and also the other thing to mention on a price to sales perspective"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10107120","10110000"," It trades at around 7.7 times"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10110480","10115680"," Which is quite a discount to its rival crowd strike for example from a valuation point of view"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10116000","10118000"," So when you think about the headwinds"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10118000","10120560"," Um, I'm sorry the tailwinds that are there for the space"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10120960","10122320"," Cyber security"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10122320","10123600"," Generative AI"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10123600","10129840"," These are products that this company is bringing to market and talking about how it's going to improve the efficiency and effectiveness"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10130080","10136320"," And analyzing threats and improving its profitability moving forward. So for us the cyber security"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10136720","10141520"," Sector is definitely an allocation that we'd consider for someone's growth portfolio"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10141680","10146480"," So give us a come all the filters that you're using to evaluate tech stocks beginning of the year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10146480","10153280"," There are a lot of people saying stay away from tech entirely. That was wrong. So heading into next year. How do you decide what's worthwhile?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10154720","10158640"," That's a great point john. I think you definitely have to be selective at these valuations"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10158960","10163680"," I think it's a combination of looking at the momentum of what's happening regarding demand"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10164160","10168400"," For a service or a product that one of these tech companies are bringing to market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10168640","10173440"," I think you do have to be cognizant of price to earnings on a forward pea perspective"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10173680","10179840"," And to my point just using sentinel an example a company that is is narrowing its losses"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10180080","10185840"," You have to take a look at sometimes things from a price to sales point of view just to make sure that you're not overpaying for growth john"

"J16sNq5Aeac","10390240","10394560"," And of course it comes as there's a push to tax the ultra rich on their wealth"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10394880","10400320"," Even on unrealized gains and kelly to me income is what you actually have it's not like your home equity"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10400320","10405040"," Although it doesn't seem like the supreme court is leaning towards anything too broad in their statements here"

"J16sNq5Aeac","10406880","10408320"," We'll see what comes down on the decision"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10408320","10413600"," But maybe they do something kind of narrow here and leave that question up to be answered still as you and I know inevitably"

"J16sNq5Aeac","10527360","10533600"," They have many things if they wanted to be high-minded to go for but taylor swift certainly very powerful. It is her world"

"J16sNq5Aeac","10548320","10553440"," Versus the rest the best being big tech which has rallied the most this year as you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10554000","10561520"," The rest well, that's all that hasn't the question now is a lasting rotation underway to those once unloved areas"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10561520","10567600"," We'll ask our experts over this final stretch in the meantime your scorecard with 60 minutes to go and regulation looks like this"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10568080","10570080"," It is the rustle that's leading today"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10570640","10575520"," Small caps continuing to see a bounce back nasdaq's a modest loser despite apple hanging"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10576000","10580320"," Right around three trillion in market cap yet again interest rates where they're falling again"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10580800","10585040"," Labor costs falling adp employment coming in below expectations"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10585280","10589520"," So that's what we're watching the two-year note yield is higher everything else is down"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10589760","10593440"," Takes us to our talk at a tape whether that recent rotation is real"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10593920","10598480"," And if it's truly time to turn your portfolio upside down as the new year approaches"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10598800","10604000"," Let's ask liz young so far as head of investment strategy with me here at post 9 nice to see you again"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10604800","10606720"," That really feels like it's a conversation here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10606720","10613440"," We're trying to gauge whether this is legit whether these unloved areas that have bounced a lot since november"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10614160","10617600"," Are going to keep going at the expense of maybe mega cap tech"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10618400","10622160"," Well, I think rotation is natural after we've seen such bifurcation"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10622640","10626560"," Such a big a big group of laggards in the market all year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10626960","10630880"," And we're at a place where I think bullish sentiment is is at the top"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10630880","10637520"," I don't know that we can get much more bullish the spread between bullish and bearish sentiment and the ai i surveys is huge"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10637520","10640480"," So I don't think that we can get that much more optimistic"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10640480","10645840"," So now investors instead of taking money out of the equity market are just looking for other places to deploy it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10646080","10649440"," Some of the things that are happening today that are a little bit confusing though"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10649520","10653280"," And I've got this sort of theme of wrapped in contradictions for next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10653840","10660240"," Is that you've got this story of oil down so much yet some of the cyclical sectors are rallying"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10660480","10664640"," So there's this contradiction between well if oil is down on the heels of supply cuts"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10664960","10668080"," Yet we've got cyclical sectors rallying the stock market doesn't agree"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10668560","10674320"," There's there's still something going on there that isn't quite making sense and then you've got small caps doing okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10674400","10678720"," But the indexes themselves are mixed on a day when the tenure yield is down"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10678800","10681280"," So the theme today is just not clear"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10681840","10683680"," You really think people are that positive?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10683760","10688320"," I still feel like there's so much negativity that's out there people are almost afraid"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10689040","10694400"," To you know decide okay, maybe the fed's gonna pull this off. Maybe we're gonna have the soft landing"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10694400","10696400"," Maybe inflation is going to continue to come down"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10696960","10701600"," And maybe the economy is going to hang in there despite some signs that it's weakening"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10701680","10705200"," And we just don't know to the degree in which it's going to continue to do that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10706000","10711040"," I think that there have been a lot of people who have jumped over the fence into that more positive territory"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10711440","10713440"," And maybe it's more along the lines of"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10714160","10716560"," There were so many that were positive self included"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10716640","10720960"," I felt pretty sure that we were gonna at least find out this year whether or not we'd have a recession"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10720960","10723600"," And I think there were a lot of people that felt the same way"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10724240","10729200"," The fact that we didn't and that inflation has come down so quickly but other things have held up so much"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10729760","10734880"," Has I think convinced people that at least maybe there's more of a possibility of the soft landing"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10734960","10741200"," Idea than before you're not fully on the bullish boat, right? I mean you've been reluctant to kind of move"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10741760","10744480"," More aggressively in that direction. What's been holding you back?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10745200","10747520"," Because there's indicators that I can't ignore"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10748160","10749200"," I am"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10749200","10754320"," Absolutely aware and I fully recognize that the market is telling us cyclicals are doing okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10754320","10755600"," The economy is doing okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10755600","10759520"," Even economic data in a lot of cases is telling us that we're doing okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10759920","10764560"," But the cooling is here and there are still signals out there that are worrisome"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10764880","10769600"," The yield-curven versions are worrisome some of the behavior and yields is really worrisome"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10769840","10774240"," And the fact that we've got companies expecting really strong earnings next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10774880","10780480"," Already at 19 times multiples on the s&p. I don't know how much further there really is to run"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10780560","10782560"," So if you just think about that idea"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10783120","10786400"," In particular if you if earnings go up next year, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10786880","10790560"," And the stock market stays exactly where it is that takes care of the multiple problem"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10790560","10792560"," We will have pes come down"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10792560","10795680"," But that doesn't make the market look all that attractive from here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10795680","10798480"," So it's difficult for me to jump on a bullish bandwagon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10798720","10804240"," Especially in the face of what's going on in in the rates market where you've got fed cuts being pulled more and more forward"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10804240","10807520"," What do you think happens if the 10-year continue? Let's show the 10-year if we could"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10808160","10811760"," Because it's been a remarkable drop from 5 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10812560","10817680"," What happens if it continues to move in this direction and goes at or below"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10818320","10819440"," 4 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10819440","10825040"," What does that do to the narrative? What does that do to sentiment now? There may be some who suggest well"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10825040","10828240"," It's going in that direction because the economy's weakening"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10828640","10830560"," Others are going to say the bulls are going to say well"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10830560","10832320"," It's coming down because"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10832320","10836240"," Inflation is coming down and the fed's going to cut and it's going down for the right reasons"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10836960","10840160"," I think I think they're both right. I think I think both sides are right"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10840320","10843200"," So if you remember what happened when we got that jobs data"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10843280","10848000"," I think it was November 3rd that weaker jobs report and we saw yield plummet"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10848240","10850880"," Right and we saw yield plummet again when we got a CPI report"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10851120","10857040"," We've got two big data releases coming. We've got jobs friday this week and then we've got CPI next week"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10857200","10859360"," Obviously ahead of the fed"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10859360","10863600"," I do think yields will continue to come down if we see cooler data"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10864560","10870480"," At some point I don't know that it's going to be this year at some point yields will come down so quickly that it does scare markets"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10870560","10872400"," And it does scare investors"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10872400","10873760"," That's natural"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10873760","10876080"," If yields are plummeting if they're moving really fast"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10876080","10880320"," It's not necessarily about the direction that they're moving it's the velocity that they're moving"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10880400","10886000"," And that starts to spook people treasury yields should not be seeing the kind of volatility that we've had in 2023"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10886240","10889680"," Do you think one of the reasons why the markets kind of been as you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10890480","10892480"," Mike Santoli and others have said"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10892480","10894320"," digesting these"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10894320","10896320"," Games that we had in in November"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10896800","10900960"," Is that because it really hasn't been anything to move the market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10901760","10905200"," All that much until you get to the jobs report as you said on friday"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10905200","10910720"," And then you get more data heading into the fed next week and even then they're not really they're not expected to do anything"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10911040","10914240"," Right now. I suppose we'll be hanging on every single word"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10915440","10918960"," The tone the inflection of the fed share as we always do"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10920240","10924400"," Yeah, we will and I think this time we're going to be looking for a message shift"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10924480","10927360"," We're not necessarily looking for an announcement that they're done with hikes"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10927360","10929760"," We're not looking for an announcement that they're going to start cutting"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10929760","10933760"," But we're going to be looking for that tone shift of are they satisfied"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10934080","10938320"," And if they start to signal that they're satisfied with the pace of economic data"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10938480","10944400"," I think that supports markets through year-end seems like we're just waiting for more information like we"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10944720","10950160"," We we want to believe a story, but we need more confirmation to fully convince ourselves almost"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10950240","10953920"," And maybe that is to your point jobs report on friday"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10954400","10959200"," Another cpi that looks good like the last one that set this whole thing off"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10960240","10965120"," In the first place keef learner joins us now truest advisory services. He's the co-chief investment officer"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10965440","10969360"," It's good to see you look you've been you've been more positive of late for sure"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10970160","10974960"," What now where do we go from here and and why do we go where you think we will"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10975920","10978560"," Yeah, well great to be with you scott you and liz"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10978880","10982720"," It's been a quick market change from when we spoke at the end of October"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10982720","10986000"," Remember at the end of October we were on with you on that friday when the market found the low"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10986560","10990160"," And we said it was a buying opportunity you asked us where would we nibble and we said small cast"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10990560","10992560"," You know small cast was down 17 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10992640","10995040"," And we think the things were the most oversold would bounce the most"
"J16sNq5Aeac","10995040","11000480"," We've seen that play out now as you mentioned the market that at the headline level has been digesting it underneath the surface"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11000480","11005200"," We've been seeing this rotation. You know the way we look at it is I still think we can squeeze a bit higher here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11005280","11008080"," I think that that small cap trade probably has for it to go"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11008080","11010720"," You have to realize we were you know on a one-year basis"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11010720","11013840"," We were trailing the the large cap market by about 20 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11013840","11018560"," That's the most since 2020 and the relative valuation is at the cheapest since 1999"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11018640","11020640"," So I think there's a bit more to go here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11020800","11022800"," I will say as we get into"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11023680","11027760"," 2024 the setup is a lot different than heading into last year meaning"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11028080","11031680"," You know last year in december the market had corrected seven or eight percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11032080","11037360"," Britishness was pervasive right and this year we've had about a 13 percent ramp up in the market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11037680","11040640"," And we're now as as Liz mentioned before we're seeing sentiment shift a bit"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11040640","11042960"," So listen, I think we still have further gains this year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11042960","11047200"," I just think we're we're gonna move into the new year and probably have a choppy year period"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11047440","11055200"," Which is also consistent with what tends to happen during an election year where you tend to chop around in the beginning of the year before making further gains"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11055280","11057280"," You think this rotation is real"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11057280","11063840"," And I mean I mean real in terms of not just for another two to three weeks or you know a few days"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11065120","11072960"," Real carries on and you actually see a meaningful rotation where it is prudent right now to start looking at those areas"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11073200","11079040"," Even if it means and this is the key even if it means taking some profits out of mega cap tech"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11080160","11084800"," I think i think i would have high conviction is saying that the the kind of the the distance between the"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11084960","11088320"," The mega cap stocks and these small cap stocks is going to compress significantly"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11088720","11092160"," And you know our world view on small caps is still neutral we're still overweight large caps"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11092160","11094400"," But you know, I think as you move into next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11095040","11101360"," The the large cap stocks or the if you look at the s&p the top 10 stocks accounted up until recently for about 80"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11101440","11104160"," Of the gains that's a record over the last 30 years"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11104160","11106000"," That's unlikely to continue"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11106000","11110160"," So I think as you move into next year you want to hedge that risk by having still large cap exposure"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11110160","11113920"," But you want to have small cap exposure you want to have exposure to the equal weight"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11114000","11117280"," But to your point out we all end that this is you know, the big turn for small caps"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11117600","11120480"," I'm not there yet. It's got to be to be frank with you"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11120480","11122880"," But I do think it makes sense to have exposure to those areas"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11123040","11126080"," And what I would also say is I still think the us and small caps"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11126480","11130720"," And the equal weight looks better than international like emerging markets and developing international"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11130720","11132880"," Which isn't getting a lot of discussion either right now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11132880","11136320"," This is such a great debate that people are having and and we've had it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11136800","11139120"," Not only on this program, but on halftime too"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11139120","11141120"," I've had it on stages with"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11141600","11148560"," You know notable guests at conferences that our network has had john rogers famous value investor says mega cap"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11149040","11151200"," mega caps doctor coming down"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11151200","11154480"," And renaissance for value investors like himself"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11155280","11157280"," Are are going to go up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11157840","11164880"," Then brad gersner comes on known as a you know again a famous tech investor and says it's this is not rocket science"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11165200","11168960"," This is where the growth is it's where the growth is going to be it's where the trend is"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11169280","11171280"," It's not going to stop anytime soon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11171360","11174960"," Well, the intention of equities in a portfolio is typically to produce growth"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11174960","11180080"," So I would imagine that people are going to look for growth in the places that they can find it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11180320","11182640"," I want to go back to the conversation with keith a little bit"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11182640","11186000"," I think the tipping point here when you were asking about is this rally real"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11186960","11194160"," The tipping point is if we get people starting to take money out of treasuries out of money markets and put it into the equity market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11194640","11198000"," A rational investor would start doing that when they stop making as much"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11198480","11203520"," In a coupon or whatever the interest rate is in those instruments and put it back into stocks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11203840","11207680"," Because that's where you can earn more and that's where you have more capital appreciation opportunity"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11208400","11210400"," People won't do that if they're nervous, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11210560","11212400"," If treasury yields are dropping"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11212400","11216080"," Even if they get low and it's no longer attractive to get that yield"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11216480","11221680"," If they're nervous and they're dropping for the wrong reason they're not going to take their money out and put it back into the equity market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11222000","11228160"," If they're dropping for good reasons and it makes more sense to put money into stocks and find more opportunity there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11228400","11230640"," That's what makes the rally durable at this point"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11230640","11236800"," The money is just moving the same money is just moving around in the equity market. What move what move to you looks more"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11237440","11239120"," overdone"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11239120","11241680"," The buying of bonds or the buying of stocks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11242320","11246560"," Buying of stocks looks more overdone. Yes hands down because"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11247360","11250800"," Socks right now. I think this is my opinion. I think that they're pricing in"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11251520","11253760"," Yes, a normalization of rates next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11254080","11259760"," The idea that the Fed can do it because they want to not because they have to but they're also pricing in"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11260320","11263760"," pretty good earnings growth almost a steady state of"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11264320","11266000"," GDP growth and a"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11266000","11272320"," Spendy consumer that keeps on spending and I don't think that all of that is going to continue at this same clip"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11272320","11277040"," But you know so so you think you think you're still going to get money going into bonds"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11277120","11280880"," But you're a wrong reasons person that that's why you think it. Yes, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11280880","11283280"," I mean that that's why you would say you don't think it's overdone"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11283440","11288400"," So you're going to get more money going in there because it's the economy worsens people are going to get more I think you use the word worried"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11289280","11292080"," And and continue to buy bonds. Yes, and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11292720","11297360"," The reason I think that we've shifted our focus from inflation now on to the labor market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11297440","11301600"," This is a big week for labor data. We've got an ADP that was below expectations"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11301600","11303600"," We've gotten jolts that was below expectations"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11304160","11307520"," Recognizing jolts still way above where they were pre-pandemic"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11308000","11313600"," But things are coming in cooler and the market has liked it so far. We get that jobs date on friday"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11314400","11321680"," Right right beneath four percent unemployment rate. I'm willing to bet that as it moves above four percent if it moves above four"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11321680","11325280"," Percent people will start to get a little bit jittery. That's a number that we haven't seen"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11325440","11327840"," That's a handle that we haven't seen in a long time"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11328320","11334160"," And the problem with the unemployment rate is that it starts to it starts to gain velocity as it rises"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11334160","11339120"," And we've had this really tiny turn this slow turn up in the unemployment rate as it does that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11339200","11343920"," It usually starts slowly, but then it gains velocity on the upside and that's what i'm concerned with"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11344320","11349440"," Keith, what's the probability? Do you think next year of a so-called everything rally?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11350080","11352720"," Stocks go up bonds continue to go up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11353520","11355520"," Gold continues to go up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11355520","11360080"," Bitcoin continues to go up now you take oil out because oil is below 70"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11360160","11363600"," And it seems to be trending in one direction in one direction only"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11364240","11367040"," Famous last words of course until it reverses, but you know my point"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11367760","11369760"," Yeah, um, listen, that's a hard hard"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11370640","11374560"," Question to answer but i listen i don't forget it's an election year. It tends to be a choppy a period"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11375040","11377440"," Um, we're gonna have 40 elections around the globe"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11377920","11383680"," Uh, this this kind of delicate balance with what the french trying to maneuver between this kind of suck of landing and recession"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11383680","11387840"," I think I think it's gonna be difficult for everything to go up and even we talked about you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11387840","11392080"," You just talked about is you know bonds overdone or stocks overdone they're moving the same way, you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11392080","11395920"," It's interesting you look at um the bond market and logarithm bonds"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11395920","11400480"," They're up about 11 percent since the low almost in line with stocks so they're actually moving somewhere together"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11400960","11406320"," And when you look at the 10 year itself, we've had four times over the last 18 months where we've moved down about 80 basis points"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11406320","11409360"," So as we get closer to 4 percent, maybe a little bit below 4 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11409360","11412800"," I actually think you're starting to see a little bit stability there and I just think it's going to be"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11413440","11417760"," Market next year where there's going to be tactical opportunities, but I don't think it's going to be in everything market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11417760","11419280"," I think it's going to be a selective market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11419520","11425920"," And I think you can see periods of time when stocks you're going to have stocks of you know 10 15 percent and others down 10 15"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11426160","11430320"," So on line with this year, which was a really difficult time for active managers because of the concentration"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11430320","11433680"," I think you have a much more fertile environment for just stopping"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11434160","11440400"," But don't you think Liz that if you know stocks can can maintain maintain some sort of you know reasonable"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11440960","11441840"," pace"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11441840","11448880"," And yields continue to come down because inflation continues to come down. Why why would somebody stay in a money market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11449680","11454160"," Where you're not getting near 5 percent anymore, but you may get better than that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11454720","11455680"," in stocks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11455680","11462640"," So you don't get a rotation out of mega cap into these other areas of the market loved unloved hot the knot whatever"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11463040","11466400"," You just get it from cash. Right. What's the probability of that?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11467440","11470720"," That would be the soft landing probability that wouldn't be my base case"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11470960","11475840"," But that's the idea that supports there being a continued rally or a continued"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11476320","11480480"," ketchup from the laggards if you're deploying fresh cash into the market"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11480880","11482880"," You're looking for things that are priced"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11482880","11489200"," Attractively and the things that would be priced attractively, especially if we're inching toward a scenario where people think we averted recession"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11489520","11494240"," The things that are priced attractively in that are going to be things like small caps and cyclicals"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11494240","11499120"," You're looking at financials some of the sectors that we've been waiting on because we know that there are problems"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11499120","11501360"," But it hasn't been confirmed that there's going to be a bigger problem"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11501600","11505600"," That's where I think you start to see the cash be deployed to you don't think we're seeing that already"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11506080","11510080"," In other words, there's there's nothing to so the nasdaq is underperformed lately"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11510080","11514720"," But as I look here, I mean still up 5% in a month, but stocks like apple"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11515520","11520960"," Apple has had such a great rebound. It's back above three trillion dollars or right about there right now in market cap"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11521360","11527200"," So I find it hard to believe in vidius 450 bucks. I find it hard to believe that money is just going to come out of"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11527680","11531840"," Of these names. I don't think it would come out. I think they probably just hold steady"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11531840","11535360"," I don't think that they'll be the runaway winners next year if that's the case"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11535360","11539520"," If we have the soft landing if we avert recession, I don't think tech would be the runaway winner"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11539600","11541520"," I doesn't necessarily mean they would lose money"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11541680","11547760"," But I think it would be more attractive to put new fresh capital into more attractively valued sectors"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11547920","11550160"," Keith last point to you on that same question"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11551280","11556000"," Yeah, listen, I don't think it's time to give up on tech yet tech outperforms when earners momentum starts to crack"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11556080","11559360"," Earners momentum relative to the market is still strong. I think there's a rotation"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11559440","11563120"," I think you stick with the large cap area. You definitely want to have more small caps"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11563120","11565600"," That maybe you would have had a year ago and be patient"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11565840","11570080"," You know be be patient for the rotation as opposed to trying to press that is happening"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11570560","11574640"," You know right now. So I would just say, you know, I would not give up on big tech yet"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11575280","11578800"," Would you say you're you said your alarm? You thought this segment was going to be over at"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11579200","11581440"," 316 and not 17. Is that what that was?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11581760","11586000"," You know, I don't know you want to keep me on this long, but I'm so suddenly appreciate the extra time with this car"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11586160","11588160"," Hey, man. The alarm goes off. I gotta call you out"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11588720","11591600"," It's good. Have a y'all key. Thanks liz. Thanks to you as well. Thank you"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11591600","11595440"," This young all right. Let's get a check on some top stocks to watch as we head into the close deep kovak"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11595920","11601520"," Is here with us today for that. Hey steve. Hey scott. Yeah plug power and bloom energy are both under pressure as morgan"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11601600","11605280"," Stanley issues a downbeat forecast for the fuel cell industry"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11605600","11612640"," And of let's say rising rates and renewable electricity prices are creating poor economics and uncertain futures for these companies"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11612880","11615840"," As a result, they're cutting their price targets for both stocks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11616240","11622320"," And avis budget is jumping after the car rental giant and now it's a special cash dividend of ten dollars a share"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11622640","11629120"," The company also says it plans to continue buying back stock through the end of the year shares up roughly 16 percent year to date"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11629440","11634880"," Far outpacing rival hurts, which is down 40 percent so far this year scott. All right, steve"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11634880","11640480"," We'll see in just a bit steve kovak. Thank you very much. We're just getting started here up next amd holding its big"

"J16sNq5Aeac","11653760","11656400"," Change you're watching closing bell on cnbc"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11670480","11672480"," You"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11700480","11702480"," You"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11730480","11732480"," You"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11760480","11762480"," You"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11769200","11775400"," It's actually lower the dipeye is right wait, I'm just so you guys know that the 45 15 is"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11790480","11793440"," So you can see it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11820480","11822480"," You"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11850480","11852480"," You"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11863680","11865680"," Five"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11866240","11869040"," Our back shares of amd well, they're down today after the company"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11869520","11873520"," Announces a new ai chip at their advancing ai event this afternoon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11873520","11877440"," Let's bring in bernstein's top chip analyst asi rascan to discuss good to see you"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11877920","11879920"," Welcome back why is the stock down"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11880480","11884160"," You know it was it was fine as it was I think you know they had"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11884720","11888880"," Some intro they announced the products they had some interesting benchmarks they had some partner announcements"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11889120","11895200"," I don't think anything was was really unexpected though from what we we heard and I mean you've got sort of like a classical sell the news event"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11895280","11896720"," That's all"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11896720","11903600"," It was it was fine for what it was right. I mean the bottom line is how quickly I guess how quickly they can produce these"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11904320","11907440"," And how quickly they can better compete with invidia"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11908080","11910880"," Yeah, and or others how would you answer that?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11911120","11916640"," Yeah, you remember so they already gave us some numbers for what they expected revenues to be next or they said more than two billion"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11916640","11920640"," Dollars, which is not a big number you have to remember like if invidia does"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11921200","11925520"," 70 billion dollars in data center revenues next year that will be viewed as disappointing"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11926080","11931200"," Two billion or even three billion or four or whatever it's a rounding error in in that sense"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11931280","11934320"," And I think that's part of the reason frankly that a&b stock has been strong"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11935040","11940000"," For a for invidia people are worried about an air pocket the word the numbers are so big it just can't be sustainable"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11940480","11946000"," With a&b I mean the numbers are not enormous, but you know they can probably make them and so that's that's why the stock has been okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11946000","11947520"," But I I mean in the grand scheme of things"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11947920","11950960"," It's not a big number relative to where the market seems to be going"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11951200","11954640"," This by the way was the sort of the biggest if you want to talk about new things that they maybe gave you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11954640","11956640"," They took up their forecast"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11956720","11962880"," For long-term prospects for the AI accelerator industry in 2027 you they were saying 150 billion and"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11963520","11966000"," Now they're saying 400 billion and again like who knows"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11966640","11970480"," But if that's anywhere close to try me it's it's presumably bullish for a&b"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11970480","11976720"," But it's probably bullish for everybody in the ecosystem, especially like players like invidia if if the the market's going to be that big"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11976720","11981360"," But we kind of already know what a&b is going to ship next year and they didn't really give us any"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11981760","11985760"," Color any changes that not not that anybody expected them to they just gave us the number a few weeks ago"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11985760","11989360"," Anyways, and you're confident that they have the capacity to do what they say"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11989920","11993760"," Yeah, I mean they said more than two at two billion by itself, which it was was"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11994400","11999280"," Reasonably disappointing. I think the the bulls out there at a&b were quite a bit higher than that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","11999280","12001120"," But if there's a more than two"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12001120","12005520"," You know, I again if they did three or they did four you can look at some of the supply chain checks"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12006400","12008880"," Assume all the orders are real you could get numbers like that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12008880","12013360"," But in the grand scheme of where I think the overall market is going that it's still very very small"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12013360","12018080"," That's that's that's not great because it's small, but it's also good because it gives more confidence"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12020880","12024400"," Who's gonna buy these and I guess I guess I asked that in the context of"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12025200","12032240"," Will customers who are already in relationships with invidia or had planned to buy invidia chips?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12032240","12035040"," Are they going to also buy AMD chips?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12035360","12039360"," You know, so the hyperscalers will and they had some partner announced"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12039360","12042640"," You know, they had microsoft up on stage with them and they had oracle and they had meta"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12043120","12046640"," And and and those guys will will buy both and they'll deploy both"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12046960","12049440"," I think it's a it's a question of magnitude and degree though"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12050080","12053840"," I mean you can buy invidia and you can buy a&b and you can be deploying both"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12053840","12057200"," But I think the difference in scale between the two is still going to be pretty massive"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12057680","12061600"," We still don't know what the enterprise side of things looks like, you know, they had del and Lenovo and super micro"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12061600","12066480"," So they will have those guys will have platforms that they will be offering to enterprise customers"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12066480","12070560"," I think it remains to be seen how much demand there may actually be from it from the enterprise"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12070960","12074720"," I would say right now, by the way, you have to remember there is there's demand for these things in part"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12074720","12077440"," Because there's demand for data center GP is in general"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12078080","12082160"," And there just aren't enough to go around right and so I think at least right now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12082160","12087600"," You're probably exploring anything you can because there just aren't enough like hopper chips and everything to to buy"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12088080","12090640"," I also suspect that there's a degree of you know, like it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12090640","12092880"," You don't really want to have a single source for anything"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12092880","12098240"," And you know, if you're a customer, you'd love to have something else in your pocket when you're sitting across the table from Jensen and invidia"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12098400","12101440"," Like negotiating on this and so there's an aspect of that as well"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12101520","12105680"," But I'd say like invidia at least just just given the magnitudes of the dollars or something"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12105680","12109120"," Nvidia is clearly in the driver's seat here like AMD is is is a piece of this"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12109600","12111920"," There's a thesis on AMD that I have some sympathy for"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12112480","12116560"," Which says the opportunity is so big that even they just get the dribs and and drabs of it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12116720","12119840"," It's enough, right, you know, it's a hundred billion dollars. You know, they'll get five percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12120640","12123520"," Yeah, I can I there there's maybe some some validity to that, right?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12123520","12128080"," But it also suggests that there are other players in the ecosystem that are likely to get far more than that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12128400","12131920"," Well, and that's where AMD is right now. All right. Well, let's let's go there then lastly"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12132160","12135680"," Because broadcom is going to report tomorrow, right? What does all this mean for for it?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12136240","12140400"," Yeah, but so on the AI side broadcom does they do they do networking they actually"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12140400","12142240"," Andy actually had broadcom up on stage with them"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12142240","12146400"," They're talking about ethernet and they're opening up their infinity fabric broadcom is going to support it"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12146640","12150240"," Broadcom also does some of the custom chips for the hyperscalers google in particular"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12150560","12154320"," And that's been a very strong driver of revenue growth this year and it'll be a strong driver next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12154800","12160480"," Um, I said people are a little nervous about the core business like Cisco and some of the others who do networking"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12160560","12164960"," We're not so great. Um, the math suggested for the quarter they're about to report"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12165600","12171600"," Um broadcom, I think is already implicitly guiding for this quarter their non AI non wireless business"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12171600","12174240"," If you do the math probably down double digits sequentially already"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12174640","12176560"," AI is actually bridging the gap"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12176560","12180720"," I suspect that AI revenue is going to be stronger next quarter. We're seeing it stronger everywhere else"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12180960","12183440"," And then the really important thing that people are looking at is VMware"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12183520","12189360"," Like they they close the VMware deal. I think it's significantly accretive and they are going to guide with VMware in the numbers for next quarter"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12189360","12192800"," Broadly, it's not in the street numbers. I suspect regardless numbers probably go up"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12192800","12194320"," That may be enough for broadcom"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12194320","12200160"," So lastly before I let you go just to tease an interview that's coming up because Christine is going to speak with lisa sue of amd"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12200240","12202240"," Of course at 430"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12202240","12206000"," What's the most important thing you think you need to hear from her?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12206720","12210800"," Um, as you assess what all of this is going to mean you think you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12211440","12213440"," What does she need to say to you?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12213440","12217280"," I I mean look we've got some of this like we saw some of the partner announcements"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12217280","12220960"," And that that's most of what I was looking for today was who is up on stage with them"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12221520","12225520"," And again, I don't know that was unexpected, but they had some some they had microsoft and some others up there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12225520","12226560"," So that that's good"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12226560","12231040"," I mean ultimately we want to see like what the trajectory is where where are the orders?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12231040","12235200"," Who is buying how much are they buying? Can they upside? We're not going to know that today"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12235200","12237840"," I don't I doubt she's going to say anything about that, you know this afternoon"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12237920","12239600"," But as we go through the next several quarters"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12240080","12244720"," I mean that's what people want to know how big can this be and how much share can they get and that's something that they will"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12244720","12247920"," Just have to deliver on as we go for the you know for the next several quarters and through next year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12248240","12252480"," Appreciate you uh giving us your rundown on what happened and what you think uh lisa had stacey"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12252480","12254160"," Thank you appreciate it very much"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12254160","12258640"," That's stacey raskan joining us once again here on closing bell up next looking beyond the magnificent seven"

"J16sNq5Aeac","12487120","12492480"," And the mega caps ended up having these discovery tight moves in which um"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12492880","12495360"," They were the drivers of this jai trade"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12496000","12501200"," Um, but now they've been discovered. So there's still earnings growth ahead the valuations"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12501280","12503280"," We don't think are"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12503280","12509520"," Ridiculously stretched in part because um that the numbers have come up so much through the course of the year"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12510000","12516160"," However, we have to see a market that is broader than just the mag 7 you still think the mag 7 though"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12516160","12522560"," We're going to have a good 2024 like what what do you think the the returns are going to be as well?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12522560","12524560"," I'm not only to be 20 percent"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12524640","12531120"," Um or higher for free stock, but are there ones that you still think have more upside?"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12531200","12533200"," Than others based on what you own"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12533760","12538880"," I think there is I think there is going to be a bifurcation in the mag 7"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12539120","12540640"," i.e. Um, you know"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12540640","12545440"," Microsoft that has a definitive ai growth driver behind it right now"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12545840","12552240"," And we start to monetize co-pilot or in vidia that really trades it up and it might I say am measly"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12552720","12554080"," 20 multiple"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12554080","12557600"," Um, well, it is less than it was. It was it is less than it was um"

"J16sNq5Aeac","12568400","12570400"," Um, sorry about that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12572080","12574160"," Sorry, I'm like doing a bunch of shit over here in the corner"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12587600","12589600"," I"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12592240","12594240"," Let me see if we can do it this way"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12598240","12600240"," Can I show this down here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12604240","12606640"," There we go. Does that work? Okay, so this is spx right here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12607760","12613760"," Uh, this is the 45 15 gamma bar. This is spx. We're gonna look at this hand show this to you"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12614640","12616640"," Make this large"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12618320","12622240"," So 45 15 is right here. Okay, right where it says doom below"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12623040","12626160"," Gamma bar all this stuff right here, right? Um"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12627280","12631600"," So you've got this is where you should be buying a dip 45 15, okay"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12633600","12635360"," but"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12635360","12638160"," You have all this known demand down here you see all that known demand"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12638800","12641840"," So you're going to expect buyers to step in here no matter what"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12642240","12645600"," All right, probably run this back up and then you get the move down here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12646080","12651680"," Just be careful here to this close you could see a big squeeze come in and then you might see that more continued blood to the downside"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12652160","12657040"," To 45 15 tomorrow could happen today, but might happen tomorrow now on spy. I'm going to show this to you on spy"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12657680","12659680"," as well"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12661840","12666320"," So just right here is a simplified way of looking at it, right? So you know you have known demand"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12666960","12668960"," Here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12669840","12672880"," Here here here all that shit right there there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12673360","12677600"," So do I think they get I think buyers get rolled here at least into tomorrow, but saying that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12678320","12679840"," um"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12679840","12684160"," To where real demand is which is actually back here. This is that 45 15 is down here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12685280","12692000"," I think yes, I wrote negative gamma, but the negative gamma is actually lower. It's a 45 15. It's right here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12692880","12694720"," Right down there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12694800","12696800"," Let's put this down here 45 15"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12697440","12703760"," So your negative gamma is actually way down here. So if you have the expectation of buyers stepping in"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12705760","12709040"," Right somewhere up in this vicinity here buyers to step in right here"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12710480","12717280"," But they can still roll this down easily into tomorrow bam slap that 45 15 and that's the that's the your dip buy right there"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12718960","12720960"," Now put your back real quick"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12724720","12726720"," You"

"J16sNq5Aeac","12785920","12790400"," Yeah, I mean it felt easier. I think then then 2024 will be"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12791040","12794800"," Especially if you had picked the right stocks like you like no wonder why you feel like that"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12795520","12799520"," I forgot about the phone to microsoft and vidia. Of course you think it was easy"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12800080","12802960"," But next year is it will be a different regime"
"J16sNq5Aeac","12803760","12808000"," And it will become more of a stock pickers market where you kind of have to find that needle in a haystack"
