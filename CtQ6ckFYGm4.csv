"CtQ6ckFYGm4","0","10560"," Happy Ground Dog Day Traders! I'm sure you didn't want to hear that this morning, or some of"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","10560","16000"," you didn't want to hear that this morning. Or should I just say good morning traders? This is Captain"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","16000","22720"," Jim James. Welcome to your daily brief. This week's been quite fruitful overall. I held some calls and"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","22720","27760"," I think some of you did as well over the weekend. Some call out these on the spy. Let's print it"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","27760","34960"," quite well. And then yesterday we had some puts that we bought at early morning or late morning,"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","34960","39360"," early afternoon. Those printed quite nicely as well. I hope you all took profit yesterday."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","41120","46320"," And Tesla range supreme in the market. Or at least for me and for some other traders."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","47680","52720"," I hope you were all able to get profit off that yesterday as well. Though that Tesla did hit my"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","52720","59440"," price target around, I think it went up to $7.27. But right around $7.20 you should have been starting"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","59440","67280"," to collect profit on your trades. And it did settle in slightly below the $7.20 mark yesterday."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","67280","74320"," So looking forward to today, the spy is starting to look very bearish, even though volume is dropping"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","74320","81120"," off. This is going to become a tough market to trade unless you are trading individual stocks"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","81120","86320"," with some volume in them. This could continue on the rest of the week, although I am going to"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","86320","93840"," anticipate some weakness leading up into Friday. But if you are a bear or a bull, there is a good"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","93840","99680"," chance that we trade inside of this zone right here or from now until Friday, if not Monday."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","99680","105360"," So be aware of that as you're trading. Now we do have factory orders coming out today and we do"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","105360","112480"," have some volatility that should be kicking in on the ADP payroll. I think that's on Wednesday."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","112480","118240"," And we do also have unemployment numbers coming out and continuing claims and then"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","118240","122960"," unemployment numbers on Friday. So the volatility should pick up as we move through the week."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","122960","131360"," I am expecting spy to trade within the range of $4.35, $97 and $4.38, $92. We can stop some lines"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","131840","137120"," in here. In fact, spy to trade down today into close. If we peek up or even push up here,"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","137120","142800"," it's a great opportunity to grab more puts and to sell these tops. We could also bounce back up"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","142800","147840"," here, but maybe we bounced down, hit this bounce back up and then sell off into the close here."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","147840","156480"," So my call for today is that we sell down to $4.3778. We come back up and hit some resistance now at"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","156480","164560"," $4.39 point or $4.38.92. Then we come back down and settle in at the close down here."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","165200","170480"," If you are a bear, some of the price targets that you're looking for are going to be $4.34.34."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","170480","175200"," I will be buying both of these dips. If we get down here, probably go in with in the money call"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","175200","180640"," spreads with 10 to 30 percent of my money over here and then maybe with another 10 to 30 percent"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","180640","185760"," outside the money call spreads. These ones will be dated about a month up. These ones down here"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","185760","193840"," dated two weeks out and would also go in with weekly or daily FDs to ride this back up."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","194480","200160"," Now down here, the bears are saying that we're going to sell the entire market down to $4.21.97."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","200160","205440"," I don't see that happening this time in the market, possibly in September. We'll trade down"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","206080","210720"," to a previous support range, wherever we are up in here. So for right now, this is where you"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","210720","216320"," should be targeting if you are a bear. If you are a bull, the only real hope that you have is that"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","216320","222800"," the Senate comes back and announces some news that is unknown. These reports come back positive"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","222800","229920"," or that we have some unknown news in the market like infrastructure or the housing,"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","230480","236960"," the eviction moratorium is reinstated. So I'm bearish at this point on the spy, although the timing"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","236960","243360"," is it's slow going. It really is. And this could spike up today. So keep that in mind."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","246480","251280"," Nasdaq is also turning bearish here. You can see this top resistance line is being respected."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","252480","258560"," At this point, sell anything that touches here as we head down until we touch this line at 14-8."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","258560","266320"," I think this is 14-800. I am this demand line right here. As long as this demand line keeps getting"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","266320","270240"," the bit pulls, keep showing up. I can't say that we're going to sell off the Nasdaq."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","271520","276880"," Although I am going to sell this down as we move forward. And if we do get a break at 14-800,"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","276880","284800"," start looking for below at let's say 14-480. And we'll split this in half. I don't think we'll get"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","284800","293600"," as low as 14-251. Call it 14-360. The only other thing that I would look at to hold up the Nasdaq"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","293600","301280"," would be the accumulation phase in Amazon. That could support the NDX for another week,"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","301280","307760"," two weeks. That is possible. Moving on to the small cap, side WM, the Russell. We are range"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","307760","312720"," brown bound in the Russell. Let's call the top of the range somewhere around 223-43. And the"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","312720","318560"," bottom of the range somewhere around 215-74. I'm expecting a daily training range today"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","318560","325920"," is that we do trade this bottom part of this range between 215 and 220. So 215 is here. 220"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","325920","333120"," is here. And we could possibly make a stab up here if ER reports are good. But the IWM is"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","333120","338560"," definitely range bound at this point. Now the IWM could sell off as we head towards end of week."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","338560","344400"," Let's say they sell it off into the weekend on bad news. I would not hold puts into Monday on the"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","344880","352480"," IWM as they might bring it back up to trade into this trading range for more earnings reports"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","352480","357680"," next week. If they do sell it off, they might create a new trading channel down in here with"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","357680","364560"," this 220-215 with dips down next week and eventually work our way down for market sell off."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","364880","374240"," Moving on to Tesla. If you were Tesla gang and you bought all of these dips down here,"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","374240","379120"," you're doing very well. We know that we had institutions selling down out of their position"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","379120","386000"," over time on Tesla. As of May 19th, we know that institutions step back in to rebuild their"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","386000","392560"," positions in Tesla. And it's been moving up since the 19th. We've got up now, I want to say 12%."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","393200","399840"," It is due for a slight pullback and we also have some market conditions playing in to Tesla as well."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","400400","406880"," We hit our target yesterday at 720 and actually went all the way up to 727 I believe and then"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","406880","410480"," settled back in that range that we talked about yesterday. I hope you were all able to take your"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","410480","417200"," profit and reassess where you'll make entry again. And I do see three buy-in points here."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","417680","422320"," Let's put a couple support lines for Tesla, traders and investors."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","424000","430880"," I want to look for a support to somewhere down here at 682, 46, and also at 652, 68."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","431760","435280"," Anything below this blue line, even if the market sells off, would be a buy for me."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","436560","443920"," As I do think that Tesla continues to move up. Now that we've hit this 720 mark, my ultimate"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","443920","450720"," price target this month would be 751, maybe 748. Although now there are some trap buyers in this"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","450720","458640"," 720 area, this will become a minor resistance as we move forward. My overall look is for 800"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","458640","464000"," over time and heading towards end of the year a possibility of 800 to 1000. Hope you all have"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","464000","470640"," a great dates for trading today. I do really appreciate the likes and subscribes on YouTube."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","470640","475760"," It shows me that you guys are interested in the content that I'm putting out. And then I also"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","475760","481600"," mostly appreciate the interaction that you're all doing with me on Twitter during the daytime."
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","481600","489360"," I do appreciate that interaction and you guys are giving me as much information that helps me"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","489360","493920"," trade throughout the day as well. And I hope that community stays strong on Twitter. I will"
"CtQ6ckFYGm4","493920","495920"," see you out there today."
