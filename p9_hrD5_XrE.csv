"p9_hrD5_XrE","0","5000"," Good morning, traders, Captain Jim James here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","7240","8920"," Hopefully I can get this video out to you"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","8920","10820"," before the news drops this morning."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","11920","14040"," I'm going to keep today's video brief"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","14040","17320"," and then try to do a video with an explain like"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","17320","20560"," I'm five posts about where we actually are"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","20560","22680"," in the market and why we're here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","22680","26680"," And I know that some of you understand what's going on."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","26680","30720"," I know that a lot of you say that you have"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","30720","33280"," the firm idea of what's going on."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","33280","36800"," And then a lot of you don't have any idea"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","36800","41080"," and it's too complicated maybe to want to dive into."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","41080","44200"," I know a lot of new traders that must be the case."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","44200","46880"," But anyways, that doesn't really matter"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","46880","47800"," at this point this morning."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","47800","51040"," What I'll try to explain where we are"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","52360","53840"," on a very basic level."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","54760","59760"," So on the first two days ago on Wednesday,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","60400","65400"," this move down below here was a manipulation tactic."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","65800","69400"," And what it did, it was an onslaught,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","69400","73440"," so some bank or hedge fund at this moment above here"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","73440","78000"," at 457 overloaded, dealers, brokers,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","78000","80280"," in that moment when we went down,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","80280","84080"," it gave a chance for whoever did this"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","84080","89080"," to buy longer dated, cheap, deep, much deeper puts options."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","92640","97640"," That also at the same time forced dealers and brokers,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","99040","104120"," market makers to de-risk themselves above"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","104120","109120"," and take on, well, it's being delta neutral."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","109400","110960"," But I'll explain more of this in a second."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","110960","114200"," Point being is they had to cut loose their calls up here"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","114200","118680"," and buy, follow along with puts down below."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","118680","123680"," So the put wall was moved from 4,500 to 4,100."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","124840","127920"," That increases, and there's more to this,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","127920","129760"," but it increases the volatility"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","130960","133620"," or the range expansion where we can trade."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","134480","137880"," So where our range expansion was smaller"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","137880","142800"," before Wednesday, it's now expanded, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","142800","145880"," So what does that open us up to?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","145880","149000"," Well, as long as volatility stays high, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","149000","151600"," And if we have events or manufactured events"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","151600","154240"," or if we have low liquidity environments to dump,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","155240","157120"," we can continue to expand that range."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","157120","159720"," Our levels are getting all over the place."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","159720","161720"," And that's why some people on Twitter"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","161720","164400"," are saying things like doom and gloom,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","164400","166600"," that I posted the other day about a market"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","166600","168960"," collapse as possible in this environment."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","168960","170320"," I agree with that."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","170320","172240"," And it's, you know, if you're a bull,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","172240","173800"," if you're just a new trader or something,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","173800","175240"," you can look at this perspective"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","175240","178040"," like when SoftBank pumps the market,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","178040","180000"," but this is in the reverse."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","180000","183480"," Now, the problem with the reverse is"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","183480","185400"," that you start to trigger sell-offs"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","185400","187440"," and it could create an actual collapse in our market,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","187440","188280"," in my view."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","188280","191640"," But so this is like a reverse gamma squeeze, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","191640","194960"," Does that make any sense to any of you out there?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","194960","196560"," So what that does is it really does."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","196560","201280"," It expands our support levels, our resistance levels."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","201280","205440"," It expands where the liquidity is."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","206880","211440"," And the market's going to seek that liquidity out, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","211440","214960"," And it also brings down where the sellers are."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","214960","218440"," So the key in this, sorry,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","218440","220960"," I'm kind of chopping this up this morning."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","220960","223640"," And it's not entirely accurate what I'm telling you."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","223640","225440"," There's more to this puzzle"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","225440","226680"," what I'm telling you right now."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","226680","229400"," But the things that you need to know today for Friday"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","229400","232800"," until I get a video out to you is this, okay?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","232800","237480"," That somewhere above 460, 461-ish,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","237480","241520"," somewhere in there, this is where sellers are hiding, okay?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","241520","244480"," That's, that means that if we get up here,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","244480","246760"," there you're going to see volume or flow"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","246760","248240"," of equity is selling,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","250120","252240"," which will make the market go down, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","252600","254440"," It's pretty, pretty simple."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","254440","259240"," Now, and that's mostly because we're in a negative gamma environment."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","259240","262920"," Now the gamma flip to turn into a positive environment"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","262920","267280"," where you can safely take trades going forward as a bull"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","267280","271200"," is somewhere above 464, which is right up in this area here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","271200","274120"," We have to break through this area here, okay?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","274120","277640"," And what that would do, or two ways for us to get there"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","277640","280840"," is to trade sideways for a day, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","280880","283520"," And then have a quick move up and break above."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","283520","287040"," That would flip us to a positive gamma situation."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","287040","291040"," And it would force dealers to get rid of their hedging down below"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","291040","295240"," at that 4100, push up to 4500, then to 5,000,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","295240","296680"," or we're not going there that soon."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","296680","297440"," Well, it's possible."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","297440","298720"," There is some weird shit going on."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","298720","302080"," But my point is that we have to get above this level here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","302080","307200"," So you are looking to buy lower, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","307200","309920"," This is where volatility is down below."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","309920","315080"," And it actually extends down now to the 4100 level, okay?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","315080","316880"," And that's really dangerous for us."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","316880","320960"," So that means we have a more volatility expansion down below."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","320960","323560"," So whenever you see us heading down here and you're like,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","323560","327600"," oh, I'm going to buy the dip, your dip extends right now"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","327600","330200"," down to 4500."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","330200","331880"," That's just a norm now."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","331880","336360"," 45, we can go to 4500 at any time at this point."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","336360","341120"," And if there's any more manipulation like this for us to ease,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","341120","344240"," it's easy for us with more anything, any event like this,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","344240","348280"," again, can easily send us down to the 4100 level"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","348280","352320"," that would open us up even deeper, 39, 36."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","352320","355760"," Okay, some crazy numbers will start to come into play."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","355760","358800"," Even if you don't believe this, this is true."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","358800","360720"," And this can truly happen."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","360720","365840"," So I want you to understand how dangerous of a situation we're in."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","365840","368760"," Even though we're in that dangerous situation,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","368760","370600"," there are some things helping us."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","370600","373200"," And that is that today's Friday,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","373200","375240"," so no one's going to be working today."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","375240","379080"," You'll see, typically, you'll see hedge funds and banks work"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","379080","381720"," and have their trades done by 10 a.m."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","381720","385080"," So you're going to see this attempt by some hedge fund"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","385080","390880"," between now and the open to either get weak enough, right?"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","390880","395000"," Let's say we get weak enough that they can possibly set the market"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","395000","398720"," by overloading the system with zero-date puts"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","398720","400880"," that would drop us severely"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","400880","404280"," and then give us even more range expansion into next week."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","404280","407240"," But if they aren't able to do that at the open,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","407240","409360"," they're kind of fucking fucked today."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","409360","412000"," And not only are they fucked today, sorry to swear,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","412000","416680"," but they're fucked today because if that plan"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","416680","420480"," by these hedge funds does not work at the bell today,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","420480","422560"," what will happen, because we've been chewing"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","422600","424360"," on this iceberg above here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","424360","425640"," We've got these sellers up here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","425640","428520"," We've just been grinding on them for two days."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","428520","430120"," We know that the banks and hedge funds"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","430120","432040"," will typically stop trading it today."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","432040","436160"," It'll give the opportunity for the market to just eat"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","436160","439560"," and destroy these sellers heading into Monday."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","439560","441120"," But that would set up though,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","441120","443760"," if this takes place today, if you're a bull,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","443760","447280"," you could possibly see us grind down"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","447280","451280"," all of these sellers today into Monday morning."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","451280","453720"," And I would say by Monday,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","453720","457680"," you could see a move higher that is absurd."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","458800","459920"," Like absurd."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","459920","464920"," You could see a squeeze that is 470s,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","466320","468680"," close to 470s, I'll bring this up here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","468680","471000"," This is what you could see a move today"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","471000","473040"," that's all the way up to 470s,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","473040","474680"," I would say early next week."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","475720","478640"," And then all-time highs,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","478640","483480"," 478, 478, 480 is easily on the table"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","483480","486240"," with a slow melt up into end of month."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","486240","488720"," Now, we do have some tail risk"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","490720","492880"," where we could get very, very volatile"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","492880","496280"," and heading into the 17th of December."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","496280","499040"," And that means we could keep dropping or even"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","499040","501040"," if we make this rocket ship up,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","501040","504280"," we could start to sell down towards December 17th."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","504280","506560"," So there's probably two moves in this, if you're a bull,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","506560","508200"," so there's a fast move."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","508200","510240"," And then there's probably gonna be a sell off"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","510240","512800"," into the 17th, but then you'll see another rip higher."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","512800","515080"," So maybe we hit this 470 now,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","515080","518520"," and then we sell down and then we go to, let's say,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","518520","522760"," 478 at the end of the month, the 31st."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","522760","524800"," Now, all of this is subject to change."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","524800","526440"," And for me, I'm a day trader."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","526440","530880"," So I know that you guys are looking for when to take along."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","530880","532080"," If you're looking to take along,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","532080","535520"," that's one week, two weeks, month out,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","535520","537880"," or let's say you buy a call that's a month or two months out,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","537880","540480"," you're gonna sell it when it hits a certain number."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","540480","543400"," Your magic number is getting over this 464 right now."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","543400","545400"," The moment you get over this 464,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","545400","548120"," you can almost kind of send them and forget them."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","548120","552320"," If you're a day trader, the next today and tomorrow"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","552320","556920"," are gonna be setting up some great stuff,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","556920","559880"," either on the downside or on the upside."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","559880","561600"," That's all I've got for you this morning."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","561600","564120"," I do see, it's what it's 818, where I am right now,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","564200","568160"," we're about 12 minutes away from news auto."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","568160","571200"," Yeah, I think 12 minutes away from news dropping."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","572160","577160"," And my view is that we are going up from here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","577960","580040"," That's my take on this."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","581200","586200"," The range, the danger to our markets on the downside,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","586880","588840"," if you, I don't know who you work for out there,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","588840","593440"," but the danger to our markets on the downside to me"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","593440","595200"," is a threat to our nation."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","595200","597640"," I think we can't, I don't mind us selling off"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","598600","601640"," over the course of one, three, six months a year."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","601640","604120"," I don't care if we've got two years of going down."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","604120","606200"," I have real concern right now"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","606200","608400"," with the way we are going down right now"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","608400","610840"," and how uncontrollable could become."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","610840","614480"," This would be a faster decline"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","614480","618080"," than any I think we've experienced."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","618080","620680"," I haven't looked back yet into the 30s,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","620680","622800"," but if this was to get out of control,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","622800","624200"," it could, the decline,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","624200","627960"," and it might not be stoppable even by limit downs."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","627960","629400"," Or maybe the limit down would stop."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","629400","632400"," Yeah, you know that the limit down would stop it to an extent,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","632400","633960"," but I don't think it's the same"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","633960","638640"," as what we experienced in 2020."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","638640","641440"," And 20, yeah, I think 20, I don't know if we,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","641440","643000"," yeah, I think we might have had some."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","643000","645000"," No, it was all 2020."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","645000","646640"," We have those crazy let them it downs,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","646640","649960"," but they were different than what this would be."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","650040","652880"," The limit downs here would not stop."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","652880","654120"," I don't believe in my mind,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","654120","658160"," I don't think it would stop the range expansion."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","658160","661040"," And you're talking about moves that could expand."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","662200","663040"," There's no joke."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","663040","667760"," You could see three, four, five hundred handles each way a day,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","667760","669680"," six, seven hundred handles."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","669680","672160"," I know this sounds preposterous to you out there,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","672160","675440"," but it's plausible."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","676680","678440"," Mathematically it's plausible."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","679320","683040"," So anyways, so for today, I am bullish."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","683040","684720"," I'm bullish day trading today."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","684720","686600"," If you want to be day trading today,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","686600","688400"," I'm going to be looking for a move straight up."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","688400","691280"," And then I'm going to be looking for a move straight up."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","691280","693080"," I think I even charted this yesterday"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","693080","695720"," and it's looking just like I said it would."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","695720","698040"," Pretty fucking close, pretty fucking close."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","698040","699640"," So I think we're going to come up here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","699640","703040"," We'll tag this above this for 60."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","703040","705400"," And then we'll start bouncing around into clothes."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","705400","709320"," It is also possible that if we're able to grind"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","709320","710640"," through these sellers here,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","710640","714360"," we could see a move up here or a giant move up into Monday."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","714360","717560"," If you see weakness today and you want to take along,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","717560","719080"," or if you see weakness,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","719080","722040"," you are looking for us to break below"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","722040","725400"," somewhere around this 455 area here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","725400","728080"," Anything below this 455 area down here,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","728080","730280"," you'll see levels down below."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","730280","732280"," If you're like, hey, I want to take a short,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","732280","734360"," it's the moment we break through 455,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","734360","736600"," it's ongoing that we're going down."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","736600","739760"," Now, if we don't get until we hit some liquidity."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","741120","744000"," But I don't foresee us going that deep today."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","744000","745120"," I don't see it happening."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","745120","749240"," So if we get, let's say we get down to this 4540,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","749240","750920"," or if we get down to 4541,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","750920","752240"," I would take along at this point."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","752240","755520"," Maybe we'd just ping pong along inside this area here."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","755520","757680"," That's all I've got for you right now."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","757680","760360"," I have some call FDs."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","760360","761800"," I'm going to be looking to hold those"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","761840","764600"," into the 460 area this morning."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","764600","767720"," And I'm going to be looking to hold those through"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","767720","770200"," until we hit this 460 area, or they burn."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","771400","773280"," And then if the news is good,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","773280","775400"," which I don't believe the news really matters"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","775400","777680"," as much as some of you out there think it does,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","777680","779280"," I think you're going to claim,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","779280","780960"," I think the news is going to be good,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","780960","785600"," and you're going to ascribe that to why we're going up."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","785600","788000"," When in reality, it has more to do with,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","788840","792560"," that we're in a negative gamma situation"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","792560","796560"," that you can see really where the volatility picks up,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","796560","799880"," and you can see below where the volatility picks up above,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","799880","803280"," where the supply is on the sell side and the buy side."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","803280","804640"," Because we're pretty much,"
"p9_hrD5_XrE","804640","806720"," that's pretty much what's controlling the market right now."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","806720","809120"," Okay, I'll see you all on the trading floor."
"p9_hrD5_XrE","809120","810760"," Thanks for all the interaction on Twitter."
