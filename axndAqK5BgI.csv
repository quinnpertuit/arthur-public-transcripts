"axndAqK5BgI","2680180","2684660"," courtesy dock, oh shoot, almost like an area just did something screwy, what did I just do,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2689780","2694500"," I've got a, sorry in the background, I'm still having issues, I'm still having issues with"
"axndAqK5BgI","2695540","2701540"," this, my displays, they're, everything, like all tech today is automatically figures out what"
"axndAqK5BgI","2701540","2705140"," you want to do, in the moment that you're like, no, no, no, I want to go there and change this,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2705940","2710820"," it's like, nope, no, we know a better way and I'm like, no, no, you don't, I want it this way,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2710820","2715380"," I want this monitor to place this size, I want it displaying that size, all that kind of stuff,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2716740","2719860"," so why are you at the dock today, what's going on, is it springtime where you are,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2721140","2729540"," it's about 73, 74 degrees sunny, I can see the sky behind you, it's gnarly here, man,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2730420","2737780"," no, it's nice, it was like straight up hot yesterday, so we've moved from, it was like 85"
"axndAqK5BgI","2737780","2744500"," yesterday and today it's kind of cooler and we got a front coming in, is it a set like 70s or"
"axndAqK5BgI","2744500","2749780"," is there any humidity, is there any pollen in the, no, we don't have any humidity but my boat is"
"axndAqK5BgI","2749780","2756020"," disgusting, it's covered with pollen, so you know, I'm dealing with that, these are some first world"
"axndAqK5BgI","2756020","2762260"," problems for sure, but yeah, no, it's absolutely gorgeous, the water temperature is still a little"
"axndAqK5BgI","2762260","2771220"," warm here, I lived in Charleston, South Carolina and my first spring there, the pollen, I couldn't"
"axndAqK5BgI","2771220","2776500"," even get the pool, the guy that comes and cleans the pools, he couldn't even get the algae out of"
"axndAqK5BgI","2776500","2781060"," the pool, he was there like three times a week, and then the pollen that would come into the pool"
"axndAqK5BgI","2781220","2789380"," was insane, oh yeah, no, it's, it's stupid, I posted a video on twitter a couple days ago of the lake"
"axndAqK5BgI","2790100","2796500"," with pollen in there, it literally looks like you're driving through sewage, like if I told"
"axndAqK5BgI","2796500","2802740"," everyone I was in like East Palestine, Ohio, they'd be like yeah, get them there, EPA needs to come"
"axndAqK5BgI","2802740","2809700"," check that out, because it just looks like absolutely horrible, your wife's boyfriend lives, I think"
"axndAqK5BgI","2809700","2816100"," nearby where that train derailed, man, I tell you that place is, that place has got some trouble"
"axndAqK5BgI","2816100","2823060"," for the next couple decades, from what I've read, it's uh, all right, they say everything is fine,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2823060","2827860"," I don't know if that's real or not, we were looking up, uh, how often the Great Lakes"
"axndAqK5BgI","2827860","2835140"," dump out their water, and then we play, yeah, I think we're talking about the area was six or"
"axndAqK5BgI","2835140","2838740"," two years, or more than, more than a year at least, it's a shallow way, but"
"axndAqK5BgI","2840900","2845940"," a lot of stuff moving, but shallow, I got cut out of some, some calls and now I'm in some puts here,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2846500","2851380"," gonna take the other side of the trade, we're starting to bleed off a little bit here,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2851380","2857700"," can you see the chart on your screen or no, let me see, yes I can, on your screen,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2858660","2863460"," do you mind my asking, do you see me or do you see, uh, the chart?"
"axndAqK5BgI","2863460","2870820"," I see, I see you and me, and uh, stream chat from, uh, from inside Twitch,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2871860","2873060"," yeah, so I can see,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2873060","2876500"," Share the main display, and I did, I don't know if you get like two, three boxes,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2876500","2878180"," what, four boxes or what?"
"axndAqK5BgI","2878180","2884660"," No, I just have like, the Twitch screen, and then uh, two video boxes, me and you."
"axndAqK5BgI","2885620","2889860"," Yeah, I gotcha. I wanted, I wanted to know if it was, let me see if I can share it with you so you"
"axndAqK5BgI","2889860","2893380"," can see an actual chart what's going on in the background, because this is what the chat can see."
"axndAqK5BgI","2894580","2901060"," Um, right now I have tiled, I have the, um, I have trading view tiled on the left and this,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2901940","2904020"," sort of stream manager on the right."
"axndAqK5BgI","2904020","2908580"," I did fix the, it says share video source optional main display, it says I'm sharing it."
"axndAqK5BgI","2909540","2913860"," Um, but you know what's neat is, I was having problems with the volume before,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2913940","2919700"," when I was interviewing people, and now I don't, uh, I used to have an echo, uh, oh, yeah, baby."
"axndAqK5BgI","2921300","2922260"," Hold on one second here."
"axndAqK5BgI","2924980","2927300"," 397 P is trading 47 cents."
"axndAqK5BgI","2928660","2930580"," Uh, what do you think it's market right now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","2930580","2931140"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","2931140","2932980"," What's your take on the market overall right now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","2934260","2935220"," God, it, uh,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2937380","2943060"," You know, as a person, as a person sitting in 400 C is right now, I've got to say they're"
"axndAqK5BgI","2943060","2945380"," going to burn straight to the ground all day long."
"axndAqK5BgI","2945380","2946420"," Turn those things off."
"axndAqK5BgI","2947300","2949140"," I got, I got stopped out of mine earlier."
"axndAqK5BgI","2949940","2953860"," No, I mean, they're, they're worth like, I think four cents or two cents or something."
"axndAqK5BgI","2953860","2955380"," I'm, I'm just going to burn."
"axndAqK5BgI","2955380","2955940"," It's fine."
"axndAqK5BgI","2957140","2957860"," Let them burn."
"axndAqK5BgI","2957860","2960100"," And then for a minute there and they got torched."
"axndAqK5BgI","2961780","2962020"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","2962020","2966340"," And Tesla, man, Tesla knows dive since the last 10 minutes or so."
"axndAqK5BgI","2966340","2971300"," It's just been, it dove straight through the one, the five and it's on its way down."
"axndAqK5BgI","2971300","2973540"," So, yeah, it's getting hot out here."
"axndAqK5BgI","2974100","2974740"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"axndAqK5BgI","2974740","2975860"," Look at that down there."
"axndAqK5BgI","2976820","2977700"," Yeah, I think pretty."
"axndAqK5BgI","2978900","2985380"," So, uh, yeah, I test my boys disappoint me."
"axndAqK5BgI","2985380","2990580"," Tesla is, has been a long night."
"axndAqK5BgI","2990580","2995620"," Always wanted to have, but honestly, with that, uh, I heard you talking about it earlier,"
"axndAqK5BgI","2995620","3004020"," but with their investor day that was a completely unfocused, you know, I know that all the"
"axndAqK5BgI","3004020","3010980"," super Tesla bulls came out and said that it was, you know, it was, it was future facing and that,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3010980","3014660"," you know, if you don't, if you don't get it, then, you know, you don't understand."
"axndAqK5BgI","3014660","3015700"," Yeah, you're not a bull."
"axndAqK5BgI","3015700","3018660"," It's like, totally disagree."
"axndAqK5BgI","3019540","3027700"," Uh, it, it, it was like, it was all promised from a company that's been promising a lot for a long"
"axndAqK5BgI","3027700","3028020"," time."
"axndAqK5BgI","3028740","3031140"," And none of it was delivery."
"axndAqK5BgI","3031700","3036340"," And so I think that the banks that are invested in Tesla are punishing them and saying,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3036340","3043380"," hey, you know, maybe you do have upside and in the great words of Captain Jim James,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3043380","3047460"," we're going to take, uh, we'll take that trade for the move, not for forever."
"axndAqK5BgI","3047460","3052020"," So we'll, we'll jump in and we'll miss 10% or 20% of that move, but we'll,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3052900","3054820"," you know, we'll miss the potential downside."
"axndAqK5BgI","3055540","3060180"," So I think a lot of people have kind of starting to reevaluate Tesla"
"axndAqK5BgI","3061140","3063860"," based on what they're doing rather than what they're saying."
"axndAqK5BgI","3064500","3065780"," And that's not good for them."
"axndAqK5BgI","3065780","3066900"," That's not good for the stock."
"axndAqK5BgI","3067860","3073460"," Uh, because what they're saying is pretty much been the, the hope and the pump for the last"
"axndAqK5BgI","3074100","3082020"," four or five years since they launched the cyber truck, the roadster and the semi,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3082580","3086100"," and they still haven't done volume delivery of any one of those items."
"axndAqK5BgI","3086100","3092100"," I mean, basically the, the semis they delivered early this year, they were, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3092820","3097220"," a handful of units to a couple of their key customers."
"axndAqK5BgI","3097220","3099940"," So I don't know, I mean, I'm, I'm a super testable."
"axndAqK5BgI","3100020","3101460"," I own two Teslas."
"axndAqK5BgI","3102260","3107700"," I, uh, I have owned every single version of Teslas that has ever been sold."
"axndAqK5BgI","3107700","3109940"," I don't want an X and S, a three, a Y."
"axndAqK5BgI","3110500","3115140"," Um, you know, I'm as bullish as they get on the products and on the company."
"axndAqK5BgI","3115780","3119140"," I mean, I'm super early adopter."
"axndAqK5BgI","3119140","3124180"," Like I bought, you know, I paid, I paid stupid money for my Model S with no cool"
"axndAqK5BgI","3124180","3125860"," features of what they come with now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3125860","3131620"," But, um, I would just say that at this point, they've got,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3133300","3138020"," I don't know, five years to deliver some things and then reintroduce new"
"axndAqK5BgI","3138820","3140900"," goals and objectives for the team."
"axndAqK5BgI","3141460","3146420"," Um, or else they're going to end up like a Cisco where they make routers and just"
"axndAqK5BgI","3146420","3151700"," make cars and, you know, they make money, but they don't, they don't shake the world up"
"axndAqK5BgI","3151700","3154180"," like everyone expected them to."
"axndAqK5BgI","3154820","3157140"," So I, I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","3157140","3162900"," I guess I'm, I guess I'm a little jaded as a owner, as a long term investor in Tesla,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3163460","3167300"," the, uh, the types of things that they've promised versus delivered in the last,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3168340","3172020"," you know, in the last four years, five years coming up on five years."
"axndAqK5BgI","3172740","3175300"," And the model through awesome model Y was pretty cool."
"axndAqK5BgI","3175940","3180260"," Um, certainly met a lot of need, but outside of that, man, it's just been a whole lot"
"axndAqK5BgI","3180260","3181540"," of, Hey, here's what we're going to do."
"axndAqK5BgI","3182500","3182820"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","3182820","3185620"," When I saw a Texas thing, I was like, I was like, that's great."
"axndAqK5BgI","3185620","3186660"," I was like, I thought it was great."
"axndAqK5BgI","3186660","3189300"," I was like 30 bucks a month, uh, charging at home."
"axndAqK5BgI","3189300","3190420"," Like that's great."
"axndAqK5BgI","3190420","3191940"," I want to see it across the nation."
"axndAqK5BgI","3192580","3193780"," I want to see it everywhere."
"axndAqK5BgI","3195460","3195780"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","3195780","3196740"," Exactly."
"axndAqK5BgI","3196740","3199940"," I mean, and I, you know, I love, I love the things they do."
"axndAqK5BgI","3199940","3202260"," I don't, don't get me wrong with their cars are great."
"axndAqK5BgI","3202260","3206020"," I'll never own, I'll never own another gas car after owning a Tesla."
"axndAqK5BgI","3206580","3208580"," Uh, will I ever own something other than a Tesla?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3208660","3212500"," Maybe, um, if something became compelling enough, especially now that they've opened"
"axndAqK5BgI","3212500","3214740"," up some of their supercharger network."
"axndAqK5BgI","3215380","3223300"," Um, anyone that's owned an electric car knows that the, um, supercharging network"
"axndAqK5BgI","3223300","3228900"," is absolutely, you know, necessary to own an electric car in America."
"axndAqK5BgI","3229860","3233220"," And from what I hear in, you know, most of the world, but definitely in the US."
"axndAqK5BgI","3233780","3236580"," Um, because everybody else is charging infrastructure sucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","3237060","3238660"," Absolute balls."
"axndAqK5BgI","3239220","3241380"," Um, you know, half the time they're broken."
"axndAqK5BgI","3241380","3242900"," When they're not broken, they're not working."
"axndAqK5BgI","3242900","3244500"," When they're not working or broken."
"axndAqK5BgI","3245060","3248500"," Uh, they, you know, they don't recognize your car when you plug them in."
"axndAqK5BgI","3248500","3250500"," Or someone has stolen the storage."
"axndAqK5BgI","3251700","3255380"," Yeah, electrify America is the biggest competitor."
"axndAqK5BgI","3255380","3260260"," But all you see is, all you see is posts about how the electrify America,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3260900","3262980"," um, chargers are broken."
"axndAqK5BgI","3263060","3267140"," And so, you know, you got to have a, uh, a Tesla supercharging network in order to"
"axndAqK5BgI","3267140","3272340"," really, really use it if you, if you are going to do a road trip."
"axndAqK5BgI","3273300","3278340"," Or drive for, you know, for more than say three, four hours at a time each way."
"axndAqK5BgI","3278820","3282980"," Uh, at that point, you've got to use some kind of a remote charger that can do fast charging."
"axndAqK5BgI","3283540","3285060"," Um, you know, I, I charge my car."
"axndAqK5BgI","3285780","3290420"," My wife has one and we don't take long trips and we use, we drive a, like a ski wagon for it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3291300","3295460"," Yeah, I mean, if you don't do long trips, then it doesn't matter."
"axndAqK5BgI","3295460","3297620"," Like I, I almost never do long trips."
"axndAqK5BgI","3298180","3302500"," And in the morning, my car's full of electricity and at night, I plug it in when I get home."
"axndAqK5BgI","3302980","3309700"," But when you do a long trip, that supercharger network is absolutely the differentiator between"
"axndAqK5BgI","3310580","3317300"," I can drive anywhere comfortably with no anxiety about whether I'm going to get there or not."
"axndAqK5BgI","3317300","3321620"," Or I'm really worried, what the hell am I going to do crossing the Everglades,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3322100","3324180"," uh, getting across Florida?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3324180","3325300"," You know, you can't do it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3325860","3329700"," The point, the point, the lightning people are saying the same thing, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3329700","3330820"," They're having those same issues."
"axndAqK5BgI","3331380","3334820"," It's any chargers except for the superchargers."
"axndAqK5BgI","3334820","3342020"," So, um, now Tesla has recently, as in like literally the last week and a half,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3342100","3349140"," opened up the supercharger network in certain places to other EVs and create an like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3349140","3353460"," they added a module onto their charging infrastructure to allow them to plug,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3354420","3362100"," you know, the North American standard plug into, uh, into a car using the Tesla plug."
"axndAqK5BgI","3363460","3365540"," You know, and that, that's, that's key."
"axndAqK5BgI","3365540","3369860"," Without that, you know, you literally couldn't,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3370420","3375460"," you couldn't be a serious player and expect electrify America to deliver for you."
"axndAqK5BgI","3375460","3377220"," Just, just go search it on Twitter."
"axndAqK5BgI","3377220","3378180"," It'll be hilarious."
"axndAqK5BgI","3378180","3383620"," You know, people posting pictures of like all the chargers with all their plugs cut off,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3384340","3386340"," you know, we're going to stop again here if I do."
"axndAqK5BgI","3386340","3387860"," I might get stopped out here in just a minute."
"axndAqK5BgI","3389060","3391700"," This is like a land of a million cuts right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3391700","3395540"," The past two days, land of a million cuts, even puts, I bought puts, uh,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3396660","3399300"," I bought puts on two days ago, I think, held them."
"axndAqK5BgI","3399940","3401220"," They didn't fucking print shit."
"axndAqK5BgI","3401220","3402660"," I had to sit them all day long."
"axndAqK5BgI","3403700","3406500"," They eventually printed that I was like, okay."
"axndAqK5BgI","3407540","3410900"," We had even more, as a matter of fact, I closed them out for profit."
"axndAqK5BgI","3410900","3414500"," And then we went down some more later and they still didn't print."
"axndAqK5BgI","3415780","3418260"," I had like kept watching them, but I was flat at that point."
"axndAqK5BgI","3418260","3419700"," And I was like, this is pointless."
"axndAqK5BgI","3420740","3426100"," No, we just got to, we just got to bearish cross on the one and five on, on Tesla."
"axndAqK5BgI","3426180","3430020"," So I did back down right now on, uh, on spy right now too."
"axndAqK5BgI","3431380","3433780"," So I'm still in puts, but I'm going to get stopped out."
"axndAqK5BgI","3433780","3434500"," I can already see it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3434900","3438900"," So, uh, even you see that then brutal."
"axndAqK5BgI","3439940","3443780"," That's the joy of not having a stop loss on your absolutely dead calls."
"axndAqK5BgI","3444420","3445460"," You don't have to worry about it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3445780","3448100"," Um, like right now, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3448100","3449860"," The three 98s are at a dollar."
"axndAqK5BgI","3449860","3452020"," They were sitting at like 80 cents all day long."
"axndAqK5BgI","3452020","3454180"," They just didn't, didn't budge, didn't move."
"axndAqK5BgI","3454180","3456580"," There was a moment in the open where there was some money to be made."
"axndAqK5BgI","3456580","3462180"," But, um, yeah, this is where's, where's the, where's the down right now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3462180","3462740"," Five minutes left."
"axndAqK5BgI","3463780","3464260"," What's that?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3465460","3465780"," Dow."
"axndAqK5BgI","3466260","3466820"," Where are we?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3467940","3468900"," Um, let me take a look at the Dow."
"axndAqK5BgI","3468900","3472100"," Let me take a, let me take a, take a quick look at the Dow."
"axndAqK5BgI","3472100","3473140"," We're only at the DIA."
"axndAqK5BgI","3474020","3479300"," Yeah, uh, DIA is kind of, kind of recovering."
"axndAqK5BgI","3480660","3481460"," Unacceptable."
"axndAqK5BgI","3482020","3482660"," Unacceptable."
"axndAqK5BgI","3482660","3484020"," I know we want that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3484020","3485460"," We want that break of the Dow."
"axndAqK5BgI","3485460","3486500"," I don't think it's going to happen."
"axndAqK5BgI","3487620","3491220"," No, God, like bears need to watch this right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3491220","3496100"," They, like bears need like bloodbath through, uh, this big yellow box."
"axndAqK5BgI","3496100","3498500"," They're not getting their, they're not getting what they want."
"axndAqK5BgI","3502260","3506100"," Sorry, I just, I just saw Caleb's, uh, no, uh, who was"
"axndAqK5BgI","3506980","3509060"," his soul, soul, soul."
"axndAqK5BgI","3509060","3512100"," This 44 is going to get monkey."
"axndAqK5BgI","3512660","3514740"," I don't even know what that is, but I want that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3514740","3515540"," What did he say?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3515540","3519220"," I want, he said that the DIA is going to get monkey."
"axndAqK5BgI","3519220","3519780"," Fuck."
"axndAqK5BgI","3519780","3520500"," Oh, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","3522900","3523780"," I'm ready for that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3523780","3524660"," Let's do that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3524660","3525220"," Some of that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3527060","3529460"," I mean, in all honesty, I'm looking at the Dow Jones"
"axndAqK5BgI","3529460","3531060"," and it's looking like it's bottoming right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3531940","3533620"," Not looking as bad."
"axndAqK5BgI","3533620","3538580"," It looks bearish on a normal chart on, um, the triggers that on the velocity,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3538580","3539060"," it doesn't."
"axndAqK5BgI","3539860","3542180"," It looks like it's actually bottoming right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3542180","3544100"," We're like, this chart looks like dog shit."
"axndAqK5BgI","3545140","3545460"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","3545460","3546980"," Looks like a double bottom on DIA."
"axndAqK5BgI","3546980","3547220"," So."
"axndAqK5BgI","3548180","3550820"," This Dow looks really, really bullish though."
"axndAqK5BgI","3550820","3554340"," Uh, they did just have S S D O W."
"axndAqK5BgI","3554340","3555780"," So short to now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3555780","3556180"," Doesn't it?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3556820","3559460"," Yeah, that is above its hourly."
"axndAqK5BgI","3559540","3561700"," Bears need like, they need to break tooth."
"axndAqK5BgI","3561700","3562660"," I think it's two 30."
"axndAqK5BgI","3562660","3564740"," They need to break with some, with some conviction."
"axndAqK5BgI","3564740","3567380"," Otherwise Dow Jones looks fine."
"axndAqK5BgI","3567380","3568100"," Tesla though."
"axndAqK5BgI","3569300","3570100"," I can't do it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3570100","3571940"," I can't even look at it right now personally."
"axndAqK5BgI","3571940","3574340"," I'm like, I'm like, why bother?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3574340","3577460"," I don't want to get trapped in any, any stock, like stock specific."
"axndAqK5BgI","3577460","3580340"," I don't mind losing a little bit of money on zero dates and stuff like that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3580340","3585860"," But when I get stuck in a stock, I end up holding it for six, nine months."
"axndAqK5BgI","3586740","3589140"," And then, and then I'm like, that's it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3589540","3590900"," My money to work somewhere else."
"axndAqK5BgI","3590900","3592020"," And it, it's too stuff."
"axndAqK5BgI","3593940","3595300"," And I got upset about it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3595300","3596580"," And then I'm, I'm angry."
"axndAqK5BgI","3596580","3603140"," And I can't, it's the one thing about stock buying stock is like, I can't stand."
"axndAqK5BgI","3604180","3608500"," Cannot stand when it rolls over on me and I get stuck, stuck for."
"axndAqK5BgI","3608500","3613300"," May I have like my, uh, my wife's, uh, family member got stuck in it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3613300","3618260"," Got trapped in like 2020 in some stock and it's been sitting on it for like two years."
"axndAqK5BgI","3619620","3622020"," You know, it's like, I can't even imagine that."
"axndAqK5BgI","3622020","3627620"," You almost just want to say, like at that point, where were you to help them get out of that one?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3627620","3631300"," They were stuck in and getting something going up so that they could be recovering."
"axndAqK5BgI","3631300","3632580"," I don't know what to say to people."
"axndAqK5BgI","3632580","3634180"," I don't, I don't like members."
"axndAqK5BgI","3634180","3635300"," I'm like, I got nothing to say to you."
"axndAqK5BgI","3635300","3635860"," I don't know what to say."
"axndAqK5BgI","3636980","3637300"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","3637300","3638180"," Whatever you feel like."
"axndAqK5BgI","3638980","3639620"," Don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","3639620","3640820"," Probably getting repriced."
"axndAqK5BgI","3641860","3642580"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","3642660","3651380"," It's like parked in the spy from 2000 and, uh, 2001 to 20, uh, 2008 and then not recovering till 2013."
"axndAqK5BgI","3651940","3652820"," Yeah, you know, it's weird."
"axndAqK5BgI","3654660","3658740"," You know, you could do is you find how it's, but what makes it fascinating is,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3659380","3666980"," if you pick a time in history when, uh, we had a crash or a market rollover of some kind,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3666980","3671060"," whatever was popular tech then, it's always fascinating to go back."
"axndAqK5BgI","3672020","3676020"," And look at tech companies that are now like two bucks, three bucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","3676020","3677140"," And they were like, right."
"axndAqK5BgI","3677140","3679380"," They're like front page of the New York times."
"axndAqK5BgI","3681300","3683540"," And they were trading for like two, three hundred dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","3683540","3688740"," And now they're today, they're like, well, like the owner of a couple of engineers in an office."
"axndAqK5BgI","3690260","3693300"," They now they have all their manufacturing done out of China and."
"axndAqK5BgI","3694500","3696660"," They've done six reverse splits."
"axndAqK5BgI","3697300","3699060"," Yeah, it's, it's sketchy."
"axndAqK5BgI","3699060","3701380"," And you're just like, man, that company never came back."
"axndAqK5BgI","3702180","3703780"," They just unzipped the bar."
"axndAqK5BgI","3703780","3704100"," All right."
"axndAqK5BgI","3704100","3705620"," None of the bell, but I did the bell."
"axndAqK5BgI","3705620","3706820"," Buckle and said, fuck it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3707780","3708900"," I'm getting a good paycheck."
"axndAqK5BgI","3709700","3713060"," My, my, my foremost loyal people are getting a good paycheck."
"axndAqK5BgI","3713060","3714420"," We're just going to hang out here and do our thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","3717140","3718740"," So, yeah, let's."
"axndAqK5BgI","3718740","3720900"," So those companies, when they don't, when they don't ever come back,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3720900","3724100"," I always wonder about people that owned those at 200."
"axndAqK5BgI","3724180","3729060"," There was one, I was looking at, um, uh, it was, I was looking at a bunch of the gun companies."
"axndAqK5BgI","3730020","3733140"," And the anti riot companies during COVID."
"axndAqK5BgI","3733780","3738500"," And there's a whole slew of them that used to be hundreds and hundreds of dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","3738500","3739620"," And then never came back."
"axndAqK5BgI","3740260","3740660"," Okay."
"axndAqK5BgI","3740660","3742340"," I'm going to get stopped out of this."
"axndAqK5BgI","3743380","3748180"," I always wondered about like all those mask companies that went to like $200."
"axndAqK5BgI","3748180","3749220"," I'm flat right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3749220","3757620"," Basically make, uh, make like, um, sanitary products and stuff and, uh, just paper products."
"axndAqK5BgI","3758260","3762180"," And then out of nowhere, suddenly we're, you know, went from obscurity,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3762180","3764020"," trading at a one X multiple."
"axndAqK5BgI","3764580","3767060"," And then they jumped up to like 30 X multiples."
"axndAqK5BgI","3768340","3768820"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","3768820","3775060"," And like all of those guys have got to be back down to, you know, basically lost all your money,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3775060","3776260"," like one to five X."
"axndAqK5BgI","3776260","3778660"," Okay."
"axndAqK5BgI","3778660","3780020"," So let, I'm going to go do it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3780020","3781060"," Stay with me here for a second."
"axndAqK5BgI","3781060","3781460"," I just do it."
"axndAqK5BgI","3781460","3781860"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","3781860","3782660"," We're at the end of the day."
"axndAqK5BgI","3782660","3783780"," So it's 321."
"axndAqK5BgI","3784340","3785380"," That's the power hour."
"axndAqK5BgI","3785380","3787140"," We're not seeing any power at the moment."
"axndAqK5BgI","3787780","3789620"," Now we are at some kind of a base right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3790500","3792820"," Now they have murdered everything in the market at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","3792820","3794900"," I'm looking at both sides right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3794900","3798820"," You got 397 C's for 59 cents."
"axndAqK5BgI","3798820","3800020"," Those are in the money."
"axndAqK5BgI","3800580","3802900"," Well, those are one strike in the money."
"axndAqK5BgI","3802980","3806260"," They've killed every call on the call side at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","3806900","3811780"," They have a, we got three three three 98 C's or P's."
"axndAqK5BgI","3811780","3813940"," Excuse me, or 92 cents right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3815380","3816900"," Just no big in this market."
"axndAqK5BgI","3816900","3817780"," Absolutely none."
"axndAqK5BgI","3819700","3823060"," This week specifically, I mean, just look at this, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3824420","3825700"," We had a sell off here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3825700","3829300"," I, dude, I made like on that first sell off right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3829300","3832260"," I think I made, I took this train right here and got out."
"axndAqK5BgI","3833140","3835860"," And I think I made 30% of the puts or something."
"axndAqK5BgI","3836580","3837700"," It wasn't even that good."
"axndAqK5BgI","3837700","3840900"," And then we went down again and they didn't print shit there either."
"axndAqK5BgI","3841620","3846020"," This is a good side here for puts yesterday on just that quick rug pull."
"axndAqK5BgI","3846900","3848740"," This was all grinded though in here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3848740","3851940"," Any kind of money we made in here, they torched puts here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3852740","3855780"," Then this little leg down in here was kind of brutal to watch as well."
"axndAqK5BgI","3855780","3861220"," It just wasn't like three, four, five, six, seven hundred percent on the downside."
"axndAqK5BgI","3861220","3862340"," And now you see us here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3863220","3864260"," And what do we have, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3864260","3866900"," We've got it's this isn't even consolidation."
"axndAqK5BgI","3866900","3868100"," It's got a hedge in the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","3868100","3868900"," I got a hedge in the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","3868900","3870020"," I got a hedge in the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","3870020","3871060"," We now have the Fed meeting."
"axndAqK5BgI","3871060","3876020"," We've got more ballcoming Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"axndAqK5BgI","3876020","3877380"," And so what are people going to do?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3877380","3878660"," They're going to hedge the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","3878660","3879300"," Look at me."
"axndAqK5BgI","3879300","3881860"," I'm like, I'm not buying Tesla stock here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3881860","3885060"," I have no wants or need to be buying this market today."
"axndAqK5BgI","3885940","3887460"," I can't buy Tesla here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3887460","3889460"," I don't want to buy it on a retest of a weekly."
"axndAqK5BgI","3890340","3892580"," So we're at a much lower low."
"axndAqK5BgI","3892580","3894900"," And this is known in the market right now, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3895540","3897540"," And then we've got ball next week as well."
"axndAqK5BgI","3897540","3900340"," We've got ball all next week, all this week."
"axndAqK5BgI","3900340","3903060"," Then we have the Fed meeting."
"axndAqK5BgI","3903060","3907140"," Normally we buy into that Fed meeting, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3907140","3908820"," We normally, every time we have a Fed meeting,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3908820","3911060"," we sell the minutes, we buy the meeting."
"axndAqK5BgI","3911540","3914180"," And so far we haven't done that at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","3914180","3917220"," Another issue here too is you've got the JPM call"
"axndAqK5BgI","3917220","3919140"," or everyone wants to trade to."
"axndAqK5BgI","3919460","3921140"," I'm sure that everybody out there is like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3921140","3924500"," we've got to keep it under 4060 or something."
"axndAqK5BgI","3925060","3927140"," And we're only at 396 right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3927140","3929460"," So that's my assumption that people are going to try to"
"axndAqK5BgI","3929460","3931860"," try to make some kind of a narrative"
"axndAqK5BgI","3931860","3936820"," that we have to be underneath this price by the 31st or something,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3936820","3938260"," or even the 17th."
"axndAqK5BgI","3938260","3940580"," There'll be a pinning on the market and that kind of stuff."
"axndAqK5BgI","3940580","3942740"," I'm sure that talk is out there right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","3942740","3944260"," So just for the next couple of days,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3944260","3947140"," I'm going to show you or just for the rest of the week and tomorrow,"
"axndAqK5BgI","3947940","3949860"," nothing has really changed here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3949860","3952580"," We have, we're at a bottom right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3953620","3956500"," This is that 396, 397 level."
"axndAqK5BgI","3956500","3958580"," Same as we talked about yesterday."
"axndAqK5BgI","3958580","3962900"," And then we have that same resistance above at 399.58."
"axndAqK5BgI","3962900","3965540"," That is above, believe it or not, where we are."
"axndAqK5BgI","3966100","3967140"," It's right up here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3969540","3974340"," And then above that, we have one more level at 40143."
"axndAqK5BgI","3974340","3977220"," And that's where your next sell side is right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","3981300","3983540"," So we got Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday."
"axndAqK5BgI","3984500","3986500"," This is the ping pong, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","3987700","3988660"," This is what it is."
"axndAqK5BgI","3988660","3989940"," I don't know what else to say about this."
"axndAqK5BgI","3991780","3995140"," And you see the Tesla's decoupling the market in itself."
"axndAqK5BgI","3995140","3999380"," You're seeing some of tech continue higher, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","3999380","4002420"," So you know that hedge funds are shorting"
"axndAqK5BgI","4002980","4007380"," the spy complex while this is all going on."
"axndAqK5BgI","4007380","4010420"," And you're not seeing it impacting the entire market right now, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4010420","4011060"," You're not."
"axndAqK5BgI","4011060","4014820"," I think we saw Apple was up now 51 cents on the day."
"axndAqK5BgI","4014820","4019300"," NVIDIA up 2.7% on the day."
"axndAqK5BgI","4019300","4022180"," And meanwhile, the spy is doing a whole hell of a lot of nothing."
"axndAqK5BgI","4022820","4028900"," I'm assuming here that fly gang and theta gang is just cleaning house in here"
"axndAqK5BgI","4028900","4032100"," with widespread otherwise there's not much else to say."
"axndAqK5BgI","4032100","4038340"," If you're a bear, you are looking to break below this weekly with some conviction."
"axndAqK5BgI","4038340","4038900"," Hold on here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4040500","4041380"," Thanks, I'd error it."
"axndAqK5BgI","4041380","4043060"," With, you need conviction down here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4043060","4046020"," If you can't get conviction, and I don't mean like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4046020","4049940"," tip the stick the tip or stick the tip down below down here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4049940","4054420"," That doesn't really cut it even, even like just trading under here for the next four days."
"axndAqK5BgI","4055380","4059460"," Maybe you could develop a new resistance instead of support of the market there."
"axndAqK5BgI","4060020","4065380"," The truth is, if you're a bear, you need to smash down below these levels down in here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4066100","4067860"," We're just not seeing it at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","4068660","4071140"," Bear is losing some velocity in this trade."
"axndAqK5BgI","4071140","4074260"," So, give me one more second here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4075380","4078500"," Just gonna mute this book map."
"axndAqK5BgI","4080260","4082580"," Maybe you'll see it in one of these meetings, I guess."
"axndAqK5BgI","4082580","4083220"," I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","4083220","4084820"," Let me know in the chat what you guys think."
"axndAqK5BgI","4085780","4090100"," I'm gonna show you here in this spy briefly, just so you can see what I'm talking about,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4090660","4092260"," how that relationship is."
"axndAqK5BgI","4092260","4097140"," You see that daily is quite bearish right here, but this usually marks the near term"
"axndAqK5BgI","4097140","4098900"," end of bearishness."
"axndAqK5BgI","4098900","4101860"," We're at minus 9.49 on the daily."
"axndAqK5BgI","4102900","4106980"," And then you can also see the hourly is starting to roll over here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4106980","4110340"," The five minutes getting bullish, the one minutes getting bullish."
"axndAqK5BgI","4110340","4112580"," Believe it or not, it's like the bottom end of bearishness."
"axndAqK5BgI","4113460","4115380"," I don't know how long this continues here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4115380","4117620"," And you can actually see this is the bottom of the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","4117620","4121300"," Unless we get some material changes here,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4121300","4124660"," I consider any pushes down here to be scamish."
"axndAqK5BgI","4124660","4127940"," No, that's scamish, just not material."
"axndAqK5BgI","4127940","4130740"," We're going to 3,300 or 2,800."
"axndAqK5BgI","4131300","4133220"," We didn't see it from J-POW today."
"axndAqK5BgI","4133220","4136100"," We didn't see J-POW do like a surprise."
"axndAqK5BgI","4136100","4140100"," One, two, five percent rate increase, something like that."
"axndAqK5BgI","4140100","4141780"," None of that came into the market today."
"axndAqK5BgI","4142420","4146340"," We could come back here on Thursday, Friday,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4146340","4149540"," and we'll say we got economic news, and that matters."
"axndAqK5BgI","4149540","4150900"," And I'm going to tell you, it really doesn't."
"axndAqK5BgI","4150900","4152100"," It's not in my view."
"axndAqK5BgI","4152100","4154340"," It might matter down to 395 or something."
"axndAqK5BgI","4154340","4156260"," But if you guys, I'm looking for 3,300."
"axndAqK5BgI","4157060","4161860"," You need something to cutting of rates, something to get us to 3,300."
"axndAqK5BgI","4162420","4168340"," And without seeing that now, it looks like it's in some kind of a bottoming process"
"axndAqK5BgI","4168340","4170740"," at this point, to me at least."
"axndAqK5BgI","4170740","4174260"," And once this ball leaves, we're going to squeeze again."
"axndAqK5BgI","4174260","4179380"," We might start seeing a lot more of this squeeziness the next week."
"axndAqK5BgI","4179380","4181700"," And you can see that that's what this is right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4181700","4185940"," And if we do that again, you want to be on that trip higher here, of course."
"axndAqK5BgI","4186980","4189780"," So it could be something just like that, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4189780","4194980"," Trade down and start squeezing higher again back up to that 402."
"axndAqK5BgI","4194980","4197140"," So you want to be in that trade and try to catch that."
"axndAqK5BgI","4197140","4200660"," And other than that, I don't know how else to say to you."
"axndAqK5BgI","4200660","4201620"," What do you think, Joe?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4203220","4208340"," I mean, I feel like that rejection at around 230, 240 today,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4210500","4215140"," that where we got told we weren't going up off of that one week trade,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4215140","4219620"," that to me was pretty definitive."
"axndAqK5BgI","4219620","4226660"," So when we turned around there, I thought 394 is a lot more likely than 400."
"axndAqK5BgI","4227300","4230660"," And I feel like that's kind of where we are."
"axndAqK5BgI","4230660","4234580"," Yeah, I think any moves up are when only when they remove the short of the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","4235700","4235940"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","4237300","4241860"," So until the hedging comes off, and even then it's just another squeeze, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4241860","4245140"," It's not really fundamental reasons why we're going up."
"axndAqK5BgI","4246100","4250500"," Like you said yesterday at the end of the show, we're looking for opportunities to"
"axndAqK5BgI","4250500","4252900"," buy a dip only so that we can sell a rip."
"axndAqK5BgI","4252900","4254100"," And that's about it."
"axndAqK5BgI","4254100","4254740"," Yeah, that's it."
"axndAqK5BgI","4254740","4255540"," That's all I see."
"axndAqK5BgI","4256500","4257860"," Yeah, just selling roots."
"axndAqK5BgI","4258980","4259540"," Hold on here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4259540","4260660"," I got to get this back up."
"axndAqK5BgI","4260660","4264740"," I'm not seeing the, I'm not seeing like a fundamental reason to buy a dip here."
"axndAqK5BgI","4267620","4268340"," Thanks, I hear."
"axndAqK5BgI","4268340","4286340"," Yeah, it's been priced in though."
"axndAqK5BgI","4286340","4290020"," The 0.50 is priced in at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","4290980","4291620"," It's priced."
"axndAqK5BgI","4294020","4295380"," What is, what's a Bloomberg?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4298340","4303460"," What's a Bloomberg terminal got the percentage rate of a 50% height at right now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4303460","4305620"," Is it like 85 or 90%?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4305620","4308100"," Yeah, I think that's where, I think that's when we got the role, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4310180","4312340"," So we're priced in at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","4312340","4321380"," I am, I wish he would come out and just say like 500, I don't know, 100, 300,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4321380","4323700"," you know, whatever he wants to do, just throw a number out there."
"axndAqK5BgI","4324580","4326340"," Shit here in the market."
"axndAqK5BgI","4326340","4328980"," 123 million through the five side."
"axndAqK5BgI","4330180","4331940"," Yeah, I mean, I'm ready."
"axndAqK5BgI","4332580","4339060"," I'm ready for him to do it, which unfortunately, I think that his plan of making a soft landing"
"axndAqK5BgI","4339060","4345060"," means he can't just go ahead and rip this band aid off, even though I saw a really good chart the"
"axndAqK5BgI","4345060","4350980"," other day on some ones. I wish I could give the attribution, but I don't remember who it was,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4351060","4356820"," that had posted a chart showing soft landing, hard landing, and then no landing."
"axndAqK5BgI","4358660","4368260"," Basically, I feel like we're at no landing where inflation continues and the economy continues"
"axndAqK5BgI","4368260","4372420"," clipping along. And I feel like that's where we are, is like, no matter what they do,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4372420","4378980"," unless they do something absolutely violent, we're going to end up with a no landing scenario"
"axndAqK5BgI","4379540","4388500"," where we basically just continue on and continue to absolutely devastate the lower and middle"
"axndAqK5BgI","4388500","4398020"," income people of America. Where else do we go? There's no easy solution aside from"
"axndAqK5BgI","4399380","4407300"," sending a shock to the system through a huge, huge Volcker-style interest rate"
"axndAqK5BgI","4408180","4416340"," whip, or just continued inflation and continued chugging along, which just continues to make"
"axndAqK5BgI","4416340","4420660"," everything more expensive and you don't make more money. So guess what? Deal with it."
"axndAqK5BgI","4423300","4426980"," I wondered about the political season that's coming up that you would just say, well,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4428100","4433940"," if your eggs are going to be $7 a rack, then what we're going to do is get you more money so that"
"axndAqK5BgI","4434020","4440180"," you can pay it, right? But see, that's the problem. And then the cocaine-fueled market comes right"
"axndAqK5BgI","4440180","4445700"," back into play again. Yeah, because get you more money only works while it's politically"
"axndAqK5BgI","4445700","4455380"," expedient now. Yeah. Right. So like, I can only serve the constituents by giving them a raise"
"axndAqK5BgI","4455380","4463380"," through stimulus or whatever for a while. It matters for me, for re-election."
"axndAqK5BgI","4463380","4470980"," But inflation shows up every single day to trade. So inflation doesn't give a shit about"
"axndAqK5BgI","4470980","4477460"," your election. Like, we'll have that every day. So if we don't put a stop to that,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4477460","4487780"," find a way to stop demand for mortgages at 7.5% and houses up 40% year over year,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4488660","4496500"," then you're going to end up with literally anyone under the age of, say, 35, never owning a day"
"axndAqK5BgI","4496500","4503460"," on the home. There's a time to when people paid 30% on cars and 15% to 20% on houses, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4504260","4508660"," That's true. But in that time, the dollar was worth something. Yeah. You know, we've had that"
"axndAqK5BgI","4508660","4514740"," discussion before. I always used to love early on in my career having the discussion with my"
"axndAqK5BgI","4515140","4519540"," dad, who was like, always the guy I'd always bounce ideas off of. And he would always say,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4519540","4525700"," Oh, well, you know, when I got out of college, I was only making $10,000 a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","4526500","4531300"," And that was my, or, you know, it was my first job out of college in 1974. And so I pulled up"
"axndAqK5BgI","4531300","4537220"," the inflation calculator and showed them where that was almost $70,000 a year. First year out"
"axndAqK5BgI","4537220","4544500"," of college, right? So, you know, yeah, it was only $10,000. A house was 26 grand or 10 grand or"
"axndAqK5BgI","4544500","4547940"," 20 grand or whatever the hell it was for you in 1970s, something."
"axndAqK5BgI","4548580","4556100"," Yeah. And inflation or interest rates were, you know, 16%. But that was on a house that was 20"
"axndAqK5BgI","4556100","4560340"," grand, you know, that's a totally different world when they're half a million dollars for like a"
"axndAqK5BgI","4560340","4569300"," starter home. So inflation and the devaluing of the US dollar means that none of this is going to"
"axndAqK5BgI","4569300","4574740"," matter. If we can't get that under control, you can, you can put interest rates slowly to the"
"axndAqK5BgI","4574740","4580580"," moon. But if we don't get the effect of the interest rate rise, then what's the point? So,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4580580","4584100"," you're just fighting the eventuality every year of inflation continuing to go higher."
"axndAqK5BgI","4584980","4590180"," Absolutely. You're not even really fighting inflation, right? You're just buying time for"
"axndAqK5BgI","4590180","4596260"," acceptance. Right. Yeah. 397 49 trying to squeeze its way up right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","4597220","4602900"," You know, like what we could just said in chat, if you take a person, if you look at trading places"
"axndAqK5BgI","4603540","4608580"," where, you know, where they were, you know, they had a broker doing commodity trading,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4608580","4614820"," guys making, you know, half a million dollars a year and had over $300,000 cash in a bank."
"axndAqK5BgI","4614820","4620420"," And he said that as though that was money, because back then it was fricking money. Like, that was,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4621300","4626740"," that was real, real money. Like nowadays, as someone said, I got $300,000 in the bank. I'll be like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4626740","4632660"," okay, yeah, you're, you're, you're broke. How quick? Like, that's not, that's not generational. Well,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4632660","4639300"," that's, that's this year, maybe next, if you, if you live easily, like carefully. So, um,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4640260","4646580"," yeah, it's, it's not, it's not what it used to be. It used to be that the US dollar was worth"
"axndAqK5BgI","4646580","4652420"," something in making 30,000 of them in a year really, really was a differentiator amongst your"
"axndAqK5BgI","4652420","4657940"," peers. Nowadays, if you make $300,000, you are starting, and living nowhere. Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","4658820","4661860"," Starting to squeeze down the spy trade in 39774."
"axndAqK5BgI","4666100","4668740"," You're seeing it seeing the little bit of a hedge cop market right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","4668740","4680500"," Yeah. You just look at it right here. I mean, what do, what fundamental news is going to squeeze"
"axndAqK5BgI","4680500","4686020"," us under here? I don't know. I don't know what kind of news could squeeze. I don't know what"
"axndAqK5BgI","4686020","4692820"," economic news could, could like trash the, crash the stock market from here. I just don't see it."
"axndAqK5BgI","4694020","4697940"," But they're, they'll try to short this again. I assure you that, uh, they're going to try to"
"axndAqK5BgI","4697940","4702340"," short this from above right here. Yeah. And right here, right here, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4702340","4706740"," Three three ninety eight. I thought this is just break three ninety eight on this run. That would be"
"axndAqK5BgI","4706740","4713780"," amazing. They're at where they are right out there at, um, it's outside that, uh, three ninety nine"
"axndAqK5BgI","4713780","4722740"," eighty nine and four oh one, uh, four oh one and some change. And, you know, senate hearing is over."
"axndAqK5BgI","4722820","4729780"," The volatility of the senate hearing is over. Uh, we've got volatility events this weekend next"
"axndAqK5BgI","4729780","4736820"," week leading into the FMC meeting, but even then you're not going to sell the market on some news"
"axndAqK5BgI","4736820","4743540"," before you get to the FMC meeting. I don't think that you are. I don't think that you're going to"
"axndAqK5BgI","4743540","4748340"," sell before, before a Fed meeting without getting the direction from the Fed president."
"axndAqK5BgI","4748740","4756820"," No, man. Nice little squeeze right now. Yeah. My 400 sees are all the way up to one penny. You"
"axndAqK5BgI","4756820","4763860"," have to one penny. I was the earlier I was on, uh, thirty ninety eight C's. They were, I think I"
"axndAqK5BgI","4763860","4769620"," bought them for twenty eight or thirty two cents or something like that. Um, when they stopped me"
"axndAqK5BgI","4769620","4774500"," out of those earlier, they got stopped out of puts down there too. They got taken for like five,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4775060","4779300"," five, five, ten penny, something like that. Both sides of it. Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","4783140","4791540"," Yeah, I was looking at that was when when you lost connection, uh, earlier today, I was asking"
"axndAqK5BgI","4791540","4798420"," right as you were dropping out. Uh, I was asking someone would post the call chains for"
"axndAqK5BgI","4798500","4803860"," explorations today. And I was just looking at the hundreds of thousands of calls from like"
"axndAqK5BgI","4803860","4810740"," three ninety seven of that were all expiring today and thinking there's, there's no way they're"
"axndAqK5BgI","4810740","4815380"," going to let any of these print. Yeah, I don't think so. There's just no way. But now they are."
"axndAqK5BgI","4816660","4819780"," Yeah, here they are. But I mean, like say, now they're printing like the three ninety eight's."
"axndAqK5BgI","4819780","4823780"," What are they at? Let's see. Well, so here's crazy, right? So we're trading up right now,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4823780","4830740"," right? So look at this. So you were trading up right now, right? And we've got, uh, 300 or we have"
"axndAqK5BgI","4832740","4838340"," four hundred and forty six thousand puts. They were ninety cents just of just an hour ago."
"axndAqK5BgI","4838900","4845300"," They're now only thirty three cents. But then they just bought another four hundred and fifty"
"axndAqK5BgI","4845300","4852100"," thousand put to three ninety seven just now, like a minute ago, they just run contracts"
"axndAqK5BgI","4852820","4862260"," on three ninety three ninety seven P just today. What's that? For today? For today right now. Ouch."
"axndAqK5BgI","4862260","4868420"," Right at this moment. So right here, right here, right here. Someone just slammed someone"
"axndAqK5BgI","4869220","4878660"," go up the market with four hundred thousand puts. And they can go up here. What's that?"
"axndAqK5BgI","4879540","4884020"," I said, that could be fueled to move us up like Winky saying like, I mean, that's just people"
"axndAqK5BgI","4884020","4889380"," closing them. They're buying the cover like to close them out because they're worth like seven"
"axndAqK5BgI","4889380","4895540"," cents versus more. Who knows? I'm like, but I don't think this is retail in any way, shape or form."
"axndAqK5BgI","4896420","4901300"," No. I don't think this is not these volumes. But none of these volumes, dude. No, no way."
"axndAqK5BgI","4902340","4908180"," Even even at the low price at the volumes, there's no one. There's no, no, there's no guy in like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4908980","4915700"," in like Aurora, Illinois going, yeah, baby. Now. Now I'm just loaded up four hundred thousand"
"axndAqK5BgI","4915700","4921540"," puts for seven cents. Let it ride, baby. Yeah. Yeah. There's no dude doing that. I want to know"
"axndAqK5BgI","4921540","4926340"," maybe there is, but four hundred and forty eight thousand in balance."
"axndAqK5BgI","4926340","4930420"," Right. Twenty three. Let me know the math on that with that cost."
"axndAqK5BgI","4932100","4933220"," Time seven cents."
"axndAqK5BgI","4935700","4941060"," What is that seven? That's seven bucks. Seven times. What is that? It's a few million dollars,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4941060","4946660"," right? Yeah. So seven times four hundred and three thousand three point five million. I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","4947300","4958340"," Let's see. That would be three million, six hundred and six. No. Yeah. Three million, sixty six thousand dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","4959940","4965700"," I got to believe that's not some guy in Aurora. Yeah. This isn't three ninety eight. This is"
"axndAqK5BgI","4965700","4972900"," three ninety seven. This is a completely different strike. Completely different strike."
"axndAqK5BgI","4973860","4978660"," I mean, I kind of hope it's some degenerate that would be like on this channel because that would"
"axndAqK5BgI","4978660","4983540"," be sick. Yeah. Just put my screen like a minute ago, two minutes ago, three minutes ago, something"
"axndAqK5BgI","4983540","4989380"," like that. So I don't know what that is. I think it's funny too, is when we're on these days,"
"axndAqK5BgI","4989380","4994660"," like today, I'm like, man, I'm like, I could go fucking skiing right now. There you go hiking right"
"axndAqK5BgI","4994660","5000260"," now. I go up to the lake. You can go sit up on your boat. What's that? You can go sit on your boat."

"axndAqK5BgI","5045380","5050500"," What time did I come on today? And so I came on, I think at 11 58 or something. And"
"axndAqK5BgI","5051380","5060260"," it was at just before. So it's at two 39. Well, it's only trading two 40, but still, it's like"

"axndAqK5BgI","5072020","5076820"," And then you can actually see the hedge on the market in the via the spy options chain."
"axndAqK5BgI","5076900","5081580"," I watch E S in the background and you'll see E S just rip face. Well, you'll see a"

"axndAqK5BgI","5355060","5359140"," I might just take this ten cents and walk. Let's see. Are we at ten cents?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5359620","5364500"," We're close. They're bleeding them off on me. We're close. They're bleeding them right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","5366180","5369060"," I was going to let them die, but I might as well take six cents."

"axndAqK5BgI","5376340","5381300"," All right. This is what the bulls need, man, to get back on track here."
"axndAqK5BgI","5383940","5391380"," Bulls need. You guys can watch someone. You guys can watch someone live on stream."
"axndAqK5BgI","5391380","5393940"," Lose a bunch of money selling calls. Wait, here we go."

"axndAqK5BgI","5417460","5422740"," You need to see us trade above 400. Trade above 40150."
"axndAqK5BgI","5424100","5425620"," Successfully retest it."

"axndAqK5BgI","5431780","5435140"," It's really missed it. 40150. You'd want to see the squeeze higher."
"axndAqK5BgI","5435780","5439540"," Squeeze higher. And then the hourly come right up underneath."
"axndAqK5BgI","5439540","5443540"," On the retest, you'd take the trade. 40150 with confidence."
"axndAqK5BgI","5444260","5448420"," That's the trade for the, that's the trade for the bull for the bears."
"axndAqK5BgI","5449940","5454100"," The bulls need one more push. Come on, spy. Are you pushing right now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5454980","5459060"," Yeah. Cause I took me so long to set up the stupid trade on my phone. Cause I'm, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5459060","5464740"," I'm live with you. Yeah, right over here. It dropped down to two cents again. But now we're at five."

"axndAqK5BgI","5465460","5472420"," Re9970. Try to get to like 168 and take some of that off as we head up here."
"axndAqK5BgI","5473540","5478260"," Got like a, like a, like thousands of call of shares worth and calls here."
"axndAqK5BgI","5478260","5481620"," And it still wasn't worth the beer that I just finished. Come on."
"axndAqK5BgI","5484500","5486660"," How many contracts do you have 300 400?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5488100","5493940"," No, no, no. Thank God. Cause I took these out way long ago. It's, uh, it's, it's 30."
"axndAqK5BgI","5493940","5497700"," But that's a lot of shares. That's a lot of shares worth. Come on."
"axndAqK5BgI","5497700","5500500"," That's not too bad. You son of a bitch. Where are we three cents?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5501300","5505380"," If it touches five again, I'll take it. Well, we're running out of time."
"axndAqK5BgI","5505940","5509380"," Bears probably like, our bulls are probably like, when are we bullish to get it? I'm like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5512580","5519140"," 40154 right here. You're welcome in the boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5520100","5522580"," Winky. Anytime. Let's see. Come on."
"axndAqK5BgI","5523460","5526020"," So we're looking on close imbalance."
"axndAqK5BgI","5526020","5529780"," It's only sitting at 236 million to the bias side. Just waiting for those."
"axndAqK5BgI","5529780","5532420"," Two. Don't be going the wrong way. Come on. Damn it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5533060","5536340"," Yeah. So right here. 243 to the bias side."
"axndAqK5BgI","5536340","5540420"," That's the mark from closing balance for the NYSE 243 million."
"axndAqK5BgI","5540420","5542740"," They're just draining the damn thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","5542740","5545780"," So they're draining them. So right here, this is where you get bullish."
"axndAqK5BgI","5546420","5548820"," That's how close it is. This wild how close it is."
"axndAqK5BgI","5550100","5557220"," And not far at all. So a successful, successful defense of this number right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","5557940","5560260"," And the market will once again be bullish."
"axndAqK5BgI","5560260","5564580"," You're talking about trading above it, retesting it successfully."
"axndAqK5BgI","5564580","5568020"," And then that's where the big trade is. That's where you like back to bullishness again."
"axndAqK5BgI","5568580","5573780"," That's how close we are, Joe. I know. Two bullishness."
"axndAqK5BgI","5573780","5576020"," That's not as far as up for our opposite thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","5576900","5580660"," Are you going to get this do or not? Are they going to deny you into the bell?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5583860","5584980"," Down to one penny."
"axndAqK5BgI","5586100","5588100"," Oh, dude, you are down to one penny."
"axndAqK5BgI","5589300","5590900"," I lost a thousand percent."
"axndAqK5BgI","5592180","5595220"," Cheers. This is what my week's been like right here."
"axndAqK5BgI","5595780","5600100"," No, see, the worst part is I'm down to 1 percent. I'm down a thousand percent."
"axndAqK5BgI","5600980","5603460"," And all I have is a sand pellegrino."
"axndAqK5BgI","5603460","5604100"," Oh, yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","5605620","5609540"," Busy water losing my ass. By the way, we want to buy a boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5610740","5612580"," That's what we're talking about right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","5612580","5615540"," I've got a boat for sale, I think, coming up here in the next month or two."
"axndAqK5BgI","5615540","5616740"," If anyone wants to buy a boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5618820","5620580"," I'm trying to sell my boat this year, I think."
"axndAqK5BgI","5623220","5628420"," Anybody want a boat? I've got like a 25 or a 30 foot boat if anybody wants it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5628420","5630820"," I don't know. I think I'm a sailboat, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5630820","5632180"," Sailboat. Yeah, it's a sailboat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5632180","5633300"," It depends on who's measuring."
"axndAqK5BgI","5634020","5637060"," If I'm paying for a slip, 24 feet."
"axndAqK5BgI","5638020","5639220"," Right. Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","5640100","5643940"," If you're selling it for, you know, for someone online, it's like 29 and a half."
"axndAqK5BgI","5643940","5646340"," 27 and a half, 29 feet long."
"axndAqK5BgI","5646980","5648580"," 29 and a half, three inches."
"axndAqK5BgI","5651380","5653220"," If I'm bragging, it's 30 feet."
"axndAqK5BgI","5654660","5654980"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","5655860","5657140"," But that's for real."
"axndAqK5BgI","5657140","5660260"," Anybody wants to buy a boat this summer and you live there in Michigan."
"axndAqK5BgI","5660260","5661300"," I've got one for you."
"axndAqK5BgI","5662660","5665460"," I've got a boat because I don't want to do is, I don't want to,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5665460","5666820"," I don't want to sail it all summer."
"axndAqK5BgI","5666820","5672260"," And then when, when a fall comes, I'll be like, okay, I want to sell it now."
"axndAqK5BgI","5673620","5674180"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","5674180","5678420"," You want to, if you hold it past May, you're going to want to keep it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5678980","5679460"," Exactly."
"axndAqK5BgI","5679460","5680180"," Yeah, exactly."
"axndAqK5BgI","5680180","5681300"," You can't sell it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5681300","5682740"," No one wants to buy a boat in the fall."
"axndAqK5BgI","5683700","5686260"," Yeah, you can tell your wife, you're like, we got to sell this boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5686260","5689860"," We need to do it for the leaves or on the trees or else by God,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5689860","5691540"," we're going to be on the boat all summer."
"axndAqK5BgI","5692580","5693620"," That's what I was going to do."
"axndAqK5BgI","5693620","5695140"," So we've got two kayaks."
"axndAqK5BgI","5695140","5700340"," So I was like, maybe we'll just kayak this summer and make it easy."
"axndAqK5BgI","5700340","5701700"," Sounds like a lot of work."
"axndAqK5BgI","5701700","5704740"," It sounds like a lot of work when you can just, you know, open the sails,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5705460","5710180"," pull them tight, you know, and, and just relax."
"axndAqK5BgI","5710180","5711380"," Kayaking is brutal, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","5711860","5716500"," You go out, you're like, you look like a swimmer when you're done."
"axndAqK5BgI","5717860","5721620"," Like your shoulders and your muscles are all like gnarly."
"axndAqK5BgI","5723140","5726260"," Packers must, I want to see you in the whole other thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","5726260","5727220"," They're physique."
"axndAqK5BgI","5727220","5729460"," Like paddleboard paddleboard people too."
"axndAqK5BgI","5729460","5730980"," There's a lot of those in my arena."
"axndAqK5BgI","5730980","5731620"," Yeah, we do that."
"axndAqK5BgI","5731620","5732900"," We all do paddleboarding."
"axndAqK5BgI","5733540","5736100"," I do too, but I don't do it like they do."
"axndAqK5BgI","5736100","5737220"," Like I do it casually."
"axndAqK5BgI","5737780","5738820"," Like a little tipsy."
"axndAqK5BgI","5739620","5741940"," It's kind of lightly paddling around the marina."
"axndAqK5BgI","5743460","5744660"," Are they doing like, uh,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5746260","5748100"," calisthenics on the paddleboard?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5748100","5751380"," Yeah, they're out there like they're trucking through the like main"
"axndAqK5BgI","5751380","5754900"," causeway and, you know, doing handstands and all that shit."
"axndAqK5BgI","5754900","5755460"," Yeah, I know."
"axndAqK5BgI","5755460","5756820"," Ficking a Starbucks upside down."
"axndAqK5BgI","5760100","5763140"," No, we're, you know, I'm out there just kind of like farting around like being like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5763140","5764740"," Hey, you guys got some beer?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5764740","5766100"," Like, kind of looking around."
"axndAqK5BgI","5766980","5768500"," That's, that's not, that's not me."
"axndAqK5BgI","5769460","5770260"," It's not my style."
"axndAqK5BgI","5772900","5774100"," They're going to, they're going to do this."
"axndAqK5BgI","5774100","5775300"," We're going to move this sideways."
"axndAqK5BgI","5775300","5776820"," We'll close below three hundred nine."
"axndAqK5BgI","5778100","5778660"," Just a crush."
"axndAqK5BgI","5778660","5781140"," That's another opportunity to short tomorrow, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5781140","5782100"," Short news tomorrow."
"axndAqK5BgI","5782900","5784580"," And the news isn't that bad right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","5784580","5786580"," The new, like none of the news is that bad."
"axndAqK5BgI","5786580","5788820"," They're bullshitting around with the market right here, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","5789460","5795300"," They're, they're bullshitting around with the fed with like 225 BPS, 50 BPS."
"axndAqK5BgI","5796100","5798260"," And then you've got like, marry the landscaper."
"axndAqK5BgI","5798260","5799700"," That's like, I'm fine."
"axndAqK5BgI","5800500","5800900"," Whatever."
"axndAqK5BgI","5802660","5803140"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","5803140","5805140"," We used her as an example this morning."
"axndAqK5BgI","5806740","5808660"," Wait, wait, what is that from?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5809380","5810020"," No, Kelly."
"axndAqK5BgI","5810020","5810660"," The wide mixers."
"axndAqK5BgI","5810660","5811060"," Kelly."
"axndAqK5BgI","5811060","5811700"," The wide mix."
"axndAqK5BgI","5811700","5813220"," There's step, some, some movie."
"axndAqK5BgI","5815060","5815380"," Yes."
"axndAqK5BgI","5815940","5816500"," That's it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5817460","5817860"," I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","5817860","5818340"," I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","5818340","5818580"," I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","5818580","5819140"," I'm mixed."
"axndAqK5BgI","5819140","5820580"," So that's a thing now, by the way."
"axndAqK5BgI","5821140","5821940"," That's a real thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","5821940","5822980"," Oh my God."
"axndAqK5BgI","5822980","5823940"," That's so great."
"axndAqK5BgI","5828500","5828980"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","5830500","5831860"," Anyone want my John boat?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5831860","5832180"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","5832180","5832500"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","5832900","5834100"," Anybody wants a boat?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5834100","5834580"," Let me know."
"axndAqK5BgI","5835940","5837060"," I'll totally sell it to you."
"axndAqK5BgI","5837060","5837860"," I'll sell it cheap."
"axndAqK5BgI","5839780","5841140"," I wouldn't sell my boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5841140","5842020"," No one can have it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5842020","5843060"," I've changed my mind."
"axndAqK5BgI","5843060","5843860"," I was joking."
"axndAqK5BgI","5843860","5844660"," Are you keeping it?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5845860","5846820"," I mean, yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","5848180","5848660"," I see."
"axndAqK5BgI","5848660","5849540"," I don't want a bigger boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5849540","5850980"," I have the perfect boat for the lake."
"axndAqK5BgI","5850980","5852500"," I love on like it's about."
"axndAqK5BgI","5853620","5856420"," It's 900 miles of shoreline."
"axndAqK5BgI","5857220","5860180"," Which is big for Georgia,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5860180","5861220"," because it's the biggest boat,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5861220","5863700"," the biggest lake in near Atlanta."
"axndAqK5BgI","5865220","5869860"," But anything bigger would be just kind of silly on this lake."
"axndAqK5BgI","5869860","5873460"," I mean, there's people on this lake with big 65 foot,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5874020","5876740"," you know, Kansas cruisers from, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5877940","5879380"," a couple million dollars,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5879380","5880660"," and you just look at them, you're like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5880660","5881380"," really dude?"
"axndAqK5BgI","5881380","5882820"," I mean, you can like go there,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5883380","5884580"," and then you can go there."
"axndAqK5BgI","5885380","5886340"," That's it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5886900","5889300"," So there's just no point like you're not,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5889300","5890180"," you're not taking like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5890180","5891060"," well, let's just do some,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5891060","5892980"," let's do three days down to the Bahamas."
"axndAqK5BgI","5892980","5895300"," Like this is not the Miami River."
"axndAqK5BgI","5895300","5896820"," This is fricking a lake."
"axndAqK5BgI","5898020","5901140"," You go from the dam to the, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5901140","5902820"," like Browns Bridge Road,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5902820","5903860"," if you have a sailboat,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5903860","5904340"," and that's it,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5904340","5905700"," because you're going further,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5905700","5907220"," and you'll break your mast off."
"axndAqK5BgI","5907220","5910180"," So we moved here and it was like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5910180","5912180"," I was like, well, we don't need that big of a boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5912180","5913780"," It's not, it's not the ocean."
"axndAqK5BgI","5913860","5915860"," I'm like, we have a trailer boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5917060","5919380"," We throw it, we have a hill that comes up and"
"axndAqK5BgI","5920820","5921780"," mast that goes down,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5921780","5922820"," and we can drive it anywhere,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5922820","5923780"," drop it into a lake."
"axndAqK5BgI","5925540","5926020"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","5926020","5927300"," And see, I do,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5927860","5929220"," I got rid of my trailer."
"axndAqK5BgI","5929220","5931220"," I wish I still had one sometimes,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5931220","5932340"," because it would be,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5932340","5933940"," it would be pretty cool to have."
"axndAqK5BgI","5935540","5936820"," But I know me."
"axndAqK5BgI","5937380","5939460"," I'm happy with it sitting in its slip."
"axndAqK5BgI","5940020","5942900"," And like, I came here today and got on it,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5942900","5945540"," and threw four ropes off and off I went."
"axndAqK5BgI","5946180","5947140"," I like that."
"axndAqK5BgI","5947140","5947300"," So."
"axndAqK5BgI","5948260","5949220"," We talked about otherwise,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5949220","5950340"," it's like this summer,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5950340","5951220"," two hours."
"axndAqK5BgI","5951220","5954020"," We're thinking about getting a rental house."
"axndAqK5BgI","5954020","5955940"," Right now we drive three hours to the lake house."
"axndAqK5BgI","5955940","5957860"," So I'm like, I want something closer,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5957860","5958820"," and I was thinking I'll put the boat in,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5958820","5959780"," but now I'm like, ah,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5959780","5960900"," it's like another fucking year,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5960900","5961620"," voting that boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5962420","5963780"," I'm like, I just want to get rid of it now."
"axndAqK5BgI","5963780","5964820"," It's springtime is coming,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5964820","5965620"," because I forget."
"axndAqK5BgI","5965620","5967460"," I'm like, oh, I'm going to sell it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5967460","5968820"," And then springtime comes,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5968820","5969380"," and I forget,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5969380","5970740"," and then summer comes, we use it,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5970740","5971780"," and then if I'm like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5972420","5974900"," next spring, I'm going to sell this fucking boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5974900","5976260"," I'm like, I'm selling this boat."
"axndAqK5BgI","5976260","5977460"," I guarantee it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5977460","5978660"," And then I forget again,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5978660","5979620"," and I sail it again."
"axndAqK5BgI","5979620","5981300"," And now this year, I remembered."
"axndAqK5BgI","5981940","5982980"," So I'm like, this says,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5982980","5983460"," this is it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5983460","5984100"," I'm getting rid of it."
"axndAqK5BgI","5984100","5985140"," I want a big ocean boat,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5985140","5985700"," if I can get one."
"axndAqK5BgI","5985700","5986580"," Not a big, but."
"axndAqK5BgI","5986580","5987300"," There you go."
"axndAqK5BgI","5987300","5988180"," That's different."
"axndAqK5BgI","5988180","5989220"," Some decent."
"axndAqK5BgI","5989220","5991940"," And El Rem, El Verem."
"axndAqK5BgI","5992580","5993060"," Oh, yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","5993060","5994100"," You can't use the word,"
"axndAqK5BgI","5994100","5995700"," you can't use the word asset"
"axndAqK5BgI","5995700","5996900"," and boat together."
"axndAqK5BgI","5996900","5998100"," That's the whole in the water."
"axndAqK5BgI","5998100","5998900"," You throw money in."
"axndAqK5BgI","5999700","6000260"," It is."
"axndAqK5BgI","6000340","6003220"," Boats are only for fun and enjoyment,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6003220","6005220"," and you understand fully"
"axndAqK5BgI","6005220","6007620"," that they are a complete loss creator."
"axndAqK5BgI","6007620","6008820"," It's a complete loss."
"axndAqK5BgI","6008820","6010420"," It's worse than a vehicle."
"axndAqK5BgI","6010420","6011620"," It's, they're worthless."
"axndAqK5BgI","6011620","6013140"," If you go in the right time of the year"
"axndAqK5BgI","6013140","6014500"," to the right person and just say,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6014500","6015220"," I'll give you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6016420","6017620"," Five dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","6017620","6019220"," Eventually they're going to come to you and say,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6019220","6019540"," take it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6019540","6020740"," Just take it the fuck away."
"axndAqK5BgI","6021380","6021780"," Just."
"axndAqK5BgI","6021780","6022180"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6022180","6022740"," Oh, yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6022740","6023940"," For a place every month for a slip."
"axndAqK5BgI","6025380","6025940"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6025940","6027220"," I mean, yeah, my, my slip."
"axndAqK5BgI","6027220","6029380"," I literally lost the reason I came here today."
"axndAqK5BgI","6030260","6032900"," I came here today to go to the Marina office"
"axndAqK5BgI","6032900","6037140"," to pay my 2023, you know, slip do's."
"axndAqK5BgI","6037140","6039220"," And, you know, it's like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6039220","6041860"," it's like over five grand for a small slip"
"axndAqK5BgI","6041860","6042900"," on the lake for a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","6043700","6045060"," And so it's just not."
"axndAqK5BgI","6046180","6048820"," It's not a, it's not a good thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","6048820","6050980"," If you, if it is literally."
"axndAqK5BgI","6050980","6052580"," Or a club."
"axndAqK5BgI","6053700","6054500"," A marina."
"axndAqK5BgI","6054500","6055460"," Yeah, I like the marina too."
"axndAqK5BgI","6055460","6056820"," I'm down with the marina."
"axndAqK5BgI","6056820","6058420"," I'm just, yeah, I'm in a marina."
"axndAqK5BgI","6058420","6060420"," There's a, there's a restaurant in my marina."
"axndAqK5BgI","6060420","6062100"," There's a service place in my marina."
"axndAqK5BgI","6062820","6063780"," It's everything I need."
"axndAqK5BgI","6063780","6066500"," But, you know, it just costs a shit of ton of money."
"axndAqK5BgI","6066500","6068740"," And it's not worth it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6068740","6071220"," If you don't, unless it's worth it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6071220","6073860"," If you enjoy it, if you don't use it all the time,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6074420","6077940"," it is literally like setting money on fire."
"axndAqK5BgI","6077940","6078260"," All right."
"axndAqK5BgI","6078260","6080740"," So I'm going to let you guys go here today."
"axndAqK5BgI","6081460","6083940"," You got Joe Harper here in the stream."
"axndAqK5BgI","6084980","6086820"," Expectations the same, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6086820","6088660"," Hedge the market into tomorrow."
"axndAqK5BgI","6089380","6092100"," For tomorrow's economic news drops in the morning."
"axndAqK5BgI","6092100","6094900"," And we'll see, we'll see what plays out."
"axndAqK5BgI","6094900","6097060"," I'm assuming it's going to be a lot of this this week."
"axndAqK5BgI","6097060","6100420"," If you are a bull out there and you're looking for a turnaround,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6100420","6101860"," you know where that number is."
"axndAqK5BgI","6101860","6102980"," I just gave it to you there."
"axndAqK5BgI","6102980","6107860"," If we can trade above and defend 40154,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6108660","6112660"," you'd say that the, the shorting of the market is over at that point."
"axndAqK5BgI","6113860","6115780"," And you're seeing some of that right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","6115860","6119220"," You've got the Fed, the Fed president has done his thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","6119220","6121140"," He, the Senate hearing is over."
"axndAqK5BgI","6121140","6123540"," That volatility has come off the market at this point."
"axndAqK5BgI","6124260","6127700"," Should be a positive catalyst regardless of what he said,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6127700","6130980"," unless it was something material in that meeting."
"axndAqK5BgI","6130980","6135620"," And that would mean that we're on standby until the Fed meeting on March 22nd."
"axndAqK5BgI","6136180","6140820"," Do I think that anything could take us down to the depths of hell from that from here?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6140820","6141860"," I don't think so, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","6142420","6146100"," Unless it's unknown news, economic calendar."
"axndAqK5BgI","6147220","6151060"," I don't, dude, I don't see 3300 on an economic calendar event."
"axndAqK5BgI","6151060","6154900"," Maybe, I guess, I guess possible, but I'm not seeing it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6154900","6161380"," So I'd be looking for above 40154 to start getting long in this market."
"axndAqK5BgI","6161380","6164580"," If we can get a, if we can get a, a recheck on that number,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6164580","6169540"," if we get a recheck on 40154 currently, I'll take a long position,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6169540","6172340"," a spread or something for the month of March and April."
"axndAqK5BgI","6172340","6175140"," But until we get above there, I want nothing to do with it this,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6175140","6180260"," this upcoming weekend into next week until it all kind of kicks off this market right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","6181060","6184740"," I'll see you guys tomorrow at nine, I'll be here tomorrow at nine 30."
"axndAqK5BgI","6185620","6188900"," Everything in the back end is done with everything I had to do here."
"axndAqK5BgI","6188900","6191620"," And I will see you guys tomorrow."
"axndAqK5BgI","6191620","6194420"," Do I'll give you a call or something on via phone call?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6194420","6196740"," I appreciate you, Joe, showing up for the stream today."
"axndAqK5BgI","6196740","6197540"," Sounds good."
"axndAqK5BgI","6197780","6198820"," Miro stopped in today."
"axndAqK5BgI","6198820","6199940"," It was good to have mirroring here."
"axndAqK5BgI","6199940","6202900"," Special thanks to Jason Hendricks and your wife's boyfriend,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6203540","6209140"," uh, particularly on admin roles and for Wiki, uh, lending a hand technically inside the discord."
"axndAqK5BgI","6209140","6212420"," I also want to say thanks to all of you out there that show up every single day."
"axndAqK5BgI","6212420","6216340"," Any new subscript or subs or followers that are here, I appreciate you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6216340","6221140"," Anyone that tips this show donates to this show to help keep it alive and going every day."
"axndAqK5BgI","6221140","6221940"," I appreciate you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6222580","6226100"," Um, and I want all of you out there to know that as, as time passes,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6226100","6232180"," you're going to start to get invitations into the new website and we hope to launch that, uh,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6232180","6236100"," or at least start beta testing in the next couple of months, uh, next month and a half,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6236100","6240500"," maybe something like that next two months somewhere in there should be coming right into"
"axndAqK5BgI","6240500","6244420"," summertime. We do that beta testing and we'll be ready for everybody to get back into the market"
"axndAqK5BgI","6244420","6249140"," at the end of the end of the summer. Uh, once they come back from, uh, the Catalina wine mixer."
"axndAqK5BgI","6249780","6250820"," Yeah, we should be ready to run."
"axndAqK5BgI","6251460","6252980"," Hope we get a bottom at that point too."
"axndAqK5BgI","6252980","6257380"," That's my hope there is that we're launching this just as we come into a market bottom"
"axndAqK5BgI","6257380","6259540"," and, uh, it's, it's for a new market."
"axndAqK5BgI","6261380","6262580"," All right. So have a good day."
"axndAqK5BgI","6262580","6263860"," You need, uh, you guys."
"axndAqK5BgI","6263860","6266740"," Well, any questions answered in the chat before I go?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6268020","6270980"," Yeah, Joe, start talking while they ask questions in the chat."
"axndAqK5BgI","6270980","6276580"," Yeah, I was just going to say we need, we need, we need a lot of, uh, we need rain heights so we"
"axndAqK5BgI","6276580","6278740"," can crash this bitch and then get going."
"axndAqK5BgI","6278740","6279220"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6279300","6284660"," So, uh, hopefully, hopefully, you know, they haven't priced in three rate hikes,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6284660","6290740"," being they've only priced in one or two and then we can get three or four and just crush this thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","6290740","6291380"," Yeah, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","6292340","6295300"," Or just end rates at this point so we can dump them."
"axndAqK5BgI","6295300","6296420"," Yeah, or just give it up."
"axndAqK5BgI","6297140","6297860"," Yeah, give it up."
"axndAqK5BgI","6298660","6302660"," I mean, we need to dump it or else none of, or you and I, both our children will never ever"
"axndAqK5BgI","6302660","6306740"," be able to own home because they're going to be like, I think about, you know, I think about that."
"axndAqK5BgI","6306740","6308900"," Four million houses here in Detroit, man."
"axndAqK5BgI","6308900","6313780"," And I'm like, I'm like, I got to, I was like, I'm like, I got to renovate a couple of these"
"axndAqK5BgI","6313780","6315460"," and hold on to them for the kids."
"axndAqK5BgI","6315460","6316980"," And I got to hold, I have an Airbnb."
"axndAqK5BgI","6316980","6318820"," I'm like, I can't sell that fucking thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","6318820","6322580"," I'm like, I'll have to give it to the kids one day."
"axndAqK5BgI","6322580","6323780"," What are we going to do with Mary?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6324260","6328580"," Like Mary, the landscape with the new lawnmowers, the new F-150 or F-250."
"axndAqK5BgI","6329620","6330580"," How do you crush her?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6330580","6330820"," Better."
"axndAqK5BgI","6330820","6336340"," I hope that, did you better hope that F-150 lives for, you know, 20 years if we're going to do"
"axndAqK5BgI","6336900","6344500"," what we did in 2001 again, where we like hit a top, come down, hit a top again in like eight"
"axndAqK5BgI","6344500","6346180"," years and then come down again."
"axndAqK5BgI","6346740","6350660"," And then in 13 years later, we finally get through the top."
"axndAqK5BgI","6351220","6353620"," Do you think, here's a serious question for you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6353620","6358020"," If you're still watching this stream right now, here's a, this is for you, Joe."
"axndAqK5BgI","6358020","6366340"," Do you think that Mary was better off when the market rolled over in 2000 or 2008,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6366340","6373140"," then, like better off sound, like sound financial positioning, better off then or better off now"
"axndAqK5BgI","6373140","6374660"," or worse off then or worse off now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6374660","6375860"," However you want to look at it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6376900","6378260"," Then for sure."
"axndAqK5BgI","6378260","6379220"," There's no question."
"axndAqK5BgI","6380500","6388100"," Yeah, because I mean, her cost of borrowing was less of an issue when the cost of goods was"
"axndAqK5BgI","6388100","6388980"," so much lower."
"axndAqK5BgI","6389700","6393620"," And saying, if you, I mean, that's an easy question to answer."
"axndAqK5BgI","6393620","6396180"," All you got to do is just go to the, go to the St. Louis Fed."
"axndAqK5BgI","6396660","6402420"," Pull up all of the data on the, on inflation versus wage inflation."
"axndAqK5BgI","6403540","6410180"," And, and lay those fucking maps on top of each other for the last 12 years, 15 years."
"axndAqK5BgI","6410180","6414580"," And see that wage inflation has gone up at a rate of about 3% a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","6414580","6419700"," And that if you add in the last three years, that price inflation has gone up,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6419700","6422020"," you know, tens of percentages a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","6422020","6429860"," So her buying power for her shitty income is, is, is, has been just absolutely"
"axndAqK5BgI","6429860","6430740"," decimated."
"axndAqK5BgI","6430740","6435460"," Whereas, so the thing she has to buy have gone up exponentially, but the,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6435460","6437780"," the money that she's been earning is not."
"axndAqK5BgI","6437780","6442980"," So I would say, you know, there's, there's no question."
"axndAqK5BgI","6442980","6450020"," The value of your dollar has gone down way faster than the increase in the income of the average person."
"axndAqK5BgI","6450980","6455940"," Do you think that, and it's insurmountable through, or do you think,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6455940","6457860"," do you think she would have gotten at least swept up?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6458420","6461140"," My, I agree with this statement, 100%."
"axndAqK5BgI","6461780","6463860"," I think maybe the more pointed question is,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6466740","6471220"," Mary back then, did she actually own that new lawn equipment in that truck and"
"axndAqK5BgI","6471220","6472660"," paid her debt down or not?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6472660","6475220"," I, I guess that my question is,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6475860","6485860"," if Mary was a back in 2007 or 2000, and the government came through to sweep up all this bad debt,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6486420","6489860"," like take Mary's business away from her, take her husband away from her,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6489860","6494100"," take her truck away from her, take her house, because she had made wrong decisions."
"axndAqK5BgI","6495860","6499540"," They're trying to do that right now in the market, and they, they can't seem,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6499540","6500740"," can't seem to."
"axndAqK5BgI","6501700","6504020"," Take Mary to the, I mean, the problem they have,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6505540","6508420"," the problem that Mary had, they have with Mary is,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6509380","6520660"," if Mary was a smart business owner, she put away, she put away a little bit of money,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6520660","6528500"," and like you say, bought hard assets that contribute to her business at extremely advantageous"
"axndAqK5BgI","6528500","6535140"," interest rates during the COVID crisis, and is currently sitting on, you know, she, she's,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6535140","6538420"," she's like a homeowner right now that refied during COVID."
"axndAqK5BgI","6538420","6538980"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6538980","6539620"," Sitting on."
"axndAqK5BgI","6539620","6540420"," Or didn't even know her."
"axndAqK5BgI","6540420","6541220"," Newer assets."
"axndAqK5BgI","6541220","6541860"," During COVID, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6542740","6543460"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6543460","6551220"," Or sitting on good assets, good or new, and they're all financed at two and a half percent."
"axndAqK5BgI","6551220","6551460"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6551460","6553700"," Four percent, I guess, if it's lawnmower or whatever."
"axndAqK5BgI","6553700","6554180"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6554180","6555060"," Four percent."
"axndAqK5BgI","6555060","6556260"," Well, go, go right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","6556260","6561060"," I mean, I sell equipment and I lease equipment to people for their, for their stores,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6561060","6568980"," and right now my, my lease rates for someone buying a piece of capital equipment for their store"
"axndAqK5BgI","6569700","6572100"," is, you know, Jesus Christ."
"axndAqK5BgI","6572100","6574340"," It's like, you know, it's in the high teens."
"axndAqK5BgI","6574340","6580100"," It's almost like a credit card, you know, for you to buy hard assets that we could"
"axndAqK5BgI","6580100","6585060"," repossess if you didn't, you know, pay it, you know, credit card, they just basically sue you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6585060","6590180"," But the, you know, these leases are on equipment, like big equipment you could come and get,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6590180","6592820"," and the interest rates are like a credit card, like 20 percent."
"axndAqK5BgI","6593540","6601220"," And so, you know, at this point, the cost of, of investing in your business is so bad that"
"axndAqK5BgI","6602340","6606660"," the average small business owner, which I guess I was saying something more along the lines of like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6607220","6610180"," you know, this lady, just their standard, just consumer."
"axndAqK5BgI","6610740","6616340"," But a business, a small business owner can't expand, grow, build their business."
"axndAqK5BgI","6616340","6619860"," They're having to pay more and more and more for staff."
"axndAqK5BgI","6620580","6623940"," And, you know, the staff are having to pay more because everything costs more."
"axndAqK5BgI","6623940","6626980"," So, you know, this is a rough cycle."
"axndAqK5BgI","6626980","6628340"," We have to break it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6628340","6636020"," It's going to suck ass just like they were on the, you know, on the hearing with"
"axndAqK5BgI","6636500","6642740"," Jay Powell yesterday with all the, you know, senators asking him questions."
"axndAqK5BgI","6642740","6646420"," And, you know, they're all like scoring hit points with each other, which is total bullshit."
"axndAqK5BgI","6646980","6653380"," But, you know, the, the real truth of the matter is for us, we, we have, we fuck shit up."
"axndAqK5BgI","6653380","6654980"," They act like it's Jerome Powell."
"axndAqK5BgI","6654980","6655620"," It's in trouble."
"axndAqK5BgI","6655620","6656900"," It's done something bad."
"axndAqK5BgI","6656900","6658020"," He's done nothing wrong."
"axndAqK5BgI","6658820","6664580"," That he's just dealing with the consequences of the actions of the Congress and what they've done."
"axndAqK5BgI","6664580","6666580"," And at this point, we spent this money."
"axndAqK5BgI","6666580","6671620"," We liqu, we liquified the economy and squeezed all this juice into it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6672180","6677300"," And at this point, prices are going crazy because, you know, where that juice went,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6677300","6680900"," it didn't go to the people you described."
"axndAqK5BgI","6680900","6684100"," The juice went to fucking JP Morgan in Goldman Sachs."
"axndAqK5BgI","6684100","6685060"," They got the juice."
"axndAqK5BgI","6685860","6687300"," The money's in the economy."
"axndAqK5BgI","6688180","6689300"," You know, Cindy didn't."
"axndAqK5BgI","6690260","6690660"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6690660","6692020"," Cindy didn't get the money."
"axndAqK5BgI","6692020","6692820"," They have to tax that."
"axndAqK5BgI","6692820","6695620"," They're going to tax these corporations like to the max."
"axndAqK5BgI","6696180","6696740"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6696740","6697620"," They have to tax."
"axndAqK5BgI","6697620","6699780"," So they got the, that's where the money went."
"axndAqK5BgI","6699780","6701220"," The money is going to the tax."
"axndAqK5BgI","6702420","6702900"," They do."
"axndAqK5BgI","6702900","6709300"," It's the only way either of that, either of that, or we literally crash the entire economy."
"axndAqK5BgI","6709300","6709540"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6710100","6716260"," So only way that we, we, we force people out of jobs that they've acquired over the last five years,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6716260","6719140"," where they've gotten increases in rates of pay."
"axndAqK5BgI","6719140","6721700"," That's where I think Mary gets hurt."
"axndAqK5BgI","6722660","6725940"," Well, I guess that's my, that's, that's what it leads into is,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6726580","6728020"," how do you hurt Mary now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6728020","6731060"," And what we're doing doesn't hurt Mary now."
"axndAqK5BgI","6731620","6735220"," So does that mean that we're going to do this shit for the next five years."
"axndAqK5BgI","6736500","6740980"," If we don't, if we don't shake the sucker needs to buy new lawnmowers or whatever."
"axndAqK5BgI","6740980","6746580"," And in that case, this politics jump in, where they're like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6746580","6751140"," now fuck this, we're going to raise max max interest rate raises."
"axndAqK5BgI","6752100","6756420"," Or is it for some kind of an acceptance where another politician jumps in just as"
"axndAqK5BgI","6756420","6758740"," fuck it, we're going to accept what it is right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","6760020","6760580"," Because you're right."
"axndAqK5BgI","6760580","6762740"," I mean, I go a devalued dollar that coat."
"axndAqK5BgI","6762740","6763460"," That's worthless."
"axndAqK5BgI","6763460","6763700"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","6763700","6764900"," That's what, that's what happens."
"axndAqK5BgI","6764900","6766020"," The dollar just becomes a win."
"axndAqK5BgI","6766020","6769060"," You know, we, yeah, I mean, that's, that's where we're headed."
"axndAqK5BgI","6769060","6774740"," I mean, if you look at a chart of the US dollars buying power over the last 35 or 40 years,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6774820","6782260"," it is gone to basically, you have to, it's kind of like the reverse of a chart for like Apple,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6782260","6782740"," right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6782740","6788500"," If you zoom Apple out, you zoom into Apple where you can see like 1983."
"axndAqK5BgI","6789300","6796740"," Basically, it looks like a line at the bottom, like where it's flat until, you know, for 15, 20 years."
"axndAqK5BgI","6796740","6798340"," And then it just takes off."
"axndAqK5BgI","6798340","6800500"," And then you can see where the numbers come in."
"axndAqK5BgI","6800500","6802580"," That's what the dollar is done in reverse."
"axndAqK5BgI","6802580","6804580"," So, you know, in the 70s."
"axndAqK5BgI","6805380","6808260"," Yeah, in the 1970s, the dollar was worth something."
"axndAqK5BgI","6808260","6814340"," And if you had 10,000 of them, you had money, like, you know, like my dad always used to say,"
"axndAqK5BgI","6814340","6816900"," he's like, when I was a kid, I would listen to the radio."
"axndAqK5BgI","6816900","6822580"," And there were ads on the radio where it said, you could be a thousand there."
"axndAqK5BgI","6822580","6823460"," I shit you not."
"axndAqK5BgI","6824580","6828980"," And it was, he heard that in like the 1950s, 60s, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","6828980","6831860"," And he would hear like, you could be a thousand there."
"axndAqK5BgI","6831940","6838180"," And like at the time, his dad was making like $1,500 a year in like 1956."
"axndAqK5BgI","6838740","6841300"," And that was not great money."
"axndAqK5BgI","6841300","6846260"," But by God, there were five kids and they were all alive and eating and lived in a house that they"
"axndAqK5BgI","6846260","6848660"," owned in the middle of no fucking where."
"axndAqK5BgI","6848660","6854500"," So solid as right now is saying that he said, I think they hinted at it yesterday with the"
"axndAqK5BgI","6854500","6856500"," Senate double digit unemployment coming."
"axndAqK5BgI","6857140","6860500"," It's the only they have to fix it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6860500","6861780"," That's the only thing to fix it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6861780","6864580"," And yesterday was hilarious because we talked on the show."
"axndAqK5BgI","6864580","6868340"," I talk about the show at the time, like, I'm like, look, I'll be honest with you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6868340","6870660"," He has to take your job away from you."
"axndAqK5BgI","6870660","6874260"," And it's not, it's not like someone with a professional job."
"axndAqK5BgI","6874260","6879540"," He's going to hit the guy that's making 30, 40, 50, 60,000 a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","6880900","6882980"," There's, there's two ways we fix this."
"axndAqK5BgI","6882980","6887540"," Number one, double digit unemployment and destroy people with white collar jobs."
"axndAqK5BgI","6887540","6887780"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","6888340","6893860"," Like we did, I would say that the 200,000 years, the 90,000 years that the engineers that"
"axndAqK5BgI","6893860","6895060"," pick up about 90 grand."
"axndAqK5BgI","6896100","6896980"," Yeah, we got it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6896980","6897540"," We got it."
"axndAqK5BgI","6897540","6904340"," If you're an older engineer, we got to decimate people with jobs that can help them afford"
"axndAqK5BgI","6904900","6913140"," to have that $400,000, $500,000 house that is currently rated at $500,000 and would require"
"axndAqK5BgI","6913140","6918900"," a mortgage of 7%, which means they're going to be dropping $5,000 a month on a mortgage."
"axndAqK5BgI","6918900","6926100"," We got to have those people lose their jobs and lose their house or we can continue to"
"axndAqK5BgI","6926100","6933540"," devalue the US dollar and put retired people in the poor house because the money they saved"
"axndAqK5BgI","6933540","6935780"," all their lives is now worth nothing."
"axndAqK5BgI","6936420","6942340"," And so they can't make money in the new economy with the inflated value of the dollar or the"
"axndAqK5BgI","6942340","6943780"," depleted value of the dollar."
"axndAqK5BgI","6943780","6950260"," So all the people that are retired or retiring soon, they all get to be poor because they're"
"axndAqK5BgI","6950260","6954180"," out of time to make money in the new dollar economy."
"axndAqK5BgI","6954180","6956340"," So one of the two's going to have to happen."
"axndAqK5BgI","6956340","6960980"," We either got to break people that are working or we're going to destroy the people that are"
"axndAqK5BgI","6960980","6963620"," ending their careers and retired."
"axndAqK5BgI","6964500","6965780"," One of the two's got to happen."
"axndAqK5BgI","6965780","6970980"," And there's no, like that's the reason why it's so it was such a heated debate when people were"
"axndAqK5BgI","6970980","6976420"," yelling at Jake Howes, they all want this to not be the case because there's no right"
"axndAqK5BgI","6976420","6977060"," answer here."
"axndAqK5BgI","6977060","6985780"," You're going to fuck a vast, a vast percentage of the United States economy in order to fix this."
"axndAqK5BgI","6986980","6988740"," And you just got to decide who it's going to be."
"axndAqK5BgI","6988740","6994580"," They were asking today on our yesterday or today on Reddit and Twitter, I saw a bunch of"
"axndAqK5BgI","6994660","7002580"," nonsense being floated about how urban areas, and this has been floated for the past six"
"axndAqK5BgI","7002580","7005220"," months or so, urban area planning is horrible."
"axndAqK5BgI","7005220","7011940"," Like in California, you can't build over two stories in highly, in large urban areas,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7013060","7016100"," parking lot problems, wherever people do this in Detroit."
"axndAqK5BgI","7016660","7019780"," They buy lots here and then rent out parking spaces."
"axndAqK5BgI","7019780","7022340"," Dude, I sit on houses here in Detroit."
"axndAqK5BgI","7022900","7025300"," Um, this is some of the same, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7025300","7026740"," So, um, right."
"axndAqK5BgI","7026740","7031540"," But the point is that Jerome today is trying to float that same idea today in the setting"
"axndAqK5BgI","7031540","7035220"," where he's like, he's like, well, we've got poor planning in urban areas."
"axndAqK5BgI","7035220","7036260"," That's part of the problem."
"axndAqK5BgI","7036260","7037380"," But I'm like, no, it isn't."
"axndAqK5BgI","7038340","7039300"," I'm like, no, it is."
"axndAqK5BgI","7039300","7043060"," You've got houses here that are like, what were we talking about the other day?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7043620","7049860"," $500,000 house right now costs you five grand a month with mortgage and all the costs."
"axndAqK5BgI","7050100","7050820"," So, right."
"axndAqK5BgI","7050820","7052660"," And that's the average house right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","7052660","7053540"," That's the average."
"axndAqK5BgI","7053540","7055140"," That's the average median house right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","7055140","7056500"," It's the average in the United States."
"axndAqK5BgI","7056500","7057540"," It's not median."
"axndAqK5BgI","7057540","7061140"," Not median average average house right now is selling."
"axndAqK5BgI","7061140","7063620"," And I'm like, how many of you guys out there could afford?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7063620","7064100"," $1000."
"axndAqK5BgI","7064100","7067940"," How many of you people out there could afford a half-lane dollar house at 5,000 a month?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7069060","7070180"," Maybe with no kids."
"axndAqK5BgI","7070180","7071860"," It's a hundred thousand down stroke."
"axndAqK5BgI","7071860","7072500"," No dog."
"axndAqK5BgI","7072500","7073300"," Twenty percent, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7074260","7074660"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","7074660","7075140"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","7075140","7079380"," You got to have a hundred thousand dollars of liquid just for the joy of getting"
"axndAqK5BgI","7079460","7080900"," a $5,000 mortgage."
"axndAqK5BgI","7080900","7081140"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","7081700","7082660"," That's not anything else."
"axndAqK5BgI","7082660","7083860"," I mean, that's not closing."
"axndAqK5BgI","7083860","7089540"," That's not all the other inspections and all the other nonsense that goes with it too."
"axndAqK5BgI","7089540","7093460"," And then, you know, having enough money to fix the AC when it breaks,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7093460","7096020"," which will pop another roof is bad too."
"axndAqK5BgI","7096020","7097620"," That's going to cost you another $30K."
"axndAqK5BgI","7100100","7100340"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","7100340","7107700"," I mean, like say, that's the problem is when a house was twenty seven grand,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7108660","7113780"," you know, when a house was twenty seven grand and your AC broke,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7114660","7116420"," you know, what were you doing?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7116420","7121300"," You were basically having to, you know, find what?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7121940","7124580"," $800,000 to replace your AC?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7125940","7132580"," Dude, I was like, when I was young, I remember that there was an idea of quality craftsmanship"
"axndAqK5BgI","7132580","7135300"," in your bathroom or kitchen that you built."
"axndAqK5BgI","7136180","7140100"," And there was an expectation that it would last for you."
"axndAqK5BgI","7140100","7145780"," It could be proud if it lasted 10, 20, 30 years and say, look, it looks great."
"axndAqK5BgI","7145780","7150020"," These days, every dude, every single house these days, if you, if it gets sold,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7150580","7152660"," we're ripping out the kitchen and putting a new in it."
"axndAqK5BgI","7152660","7154740"," We're putting up the bathroom and putting it on a new bathroom."
"axndAqK5BgI","7156020","7158820"," The new homebuyers, we're going to bring it to this thing."
"axndAqK5BgI","7158820","7161460"," And I'm like, it's so nothing is built anymore."
"axndAqK5BgI","7161460","7165860"," Everything is throwaway fashion, throwaway looks to a house."
"axndAqK5BgI","7165860","7168660"," Like every house I walk into right now, I'm like, man,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7169060","7170580"," I'm like, those green tiles look great."
"axndAqK5BgI","7170580","7173380"," But I'm like, how are they going to look in five years?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7173940","7175860"," And then I'll do the houses."
"axndAqK5BgI","7175860","7178340"," You do see, I see flips with tire work."
"axndAqK5BgI","7178340","7180100"," And I'm like, that's a really nice looking tile."
"axndAqK5BgI","7180100","7183700"," But then I look closer at it and I'm like, that fucking tiles built to last like"
"axndAqK5BgI","7184420","7186500"," maybe five years before it starts chipping."
"axndAqK5BgI","7187380","7189300"," Maybe five years, you'll get out of that tile."
"axndAqK5BgI","7189300","7190500"," And that's everywhere."
"axndAqK5BgI","7190500","7193220"," And they're still charging, you know, $500,000"
"axndAqK5BgI","7194340","7196500"," for these houses that aren't actually built to last,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7196500","7201540"," or even look fashionable and longer than five years, maybe three, five years."
"axndAqK5BgI","7203460","7205460"," I don't know, housing is a weird thing right now to me."
"axndAqK5BgI","7205460","7208740"," So it's a weird thing to me."
"axndAqK5BgI","7208740","7210420"," And how do you get people into those houses?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7210420","7213220"," Not at $500,000, not at a million dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","7213220","7216100"," You can't get a college grads not going to get that opportunity."
"axndAqK5BgI","7216980","7220820"," Well, the college grad doesn't have $100,000 put down on a, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7220820","7221940"," $500,000 house."
"axndAqK5BgI","7221940","7224500"," But, you know, I mean, now if you do an FHA loan,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7224500","7227780"," you do two or, you know, five percent or whatever down."
"axndAqK5BgI","7227780","7231140"," But then, you know, then your mortgage goes out"
"axndAqK5BgI","7231140","7233460"," because you're financing a larger percentage of it."
"axndAqK5BgI","7233460","7233860"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","7233860","7240500"," So it, you know, there's no good entry for young people today already."
"axndAqK5BgI","7240500","7244020"," And as long as we have low inventory,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7244020","7246580"," which we do, because people with two percent mortgages"
"axndAqK5BgI","7246580","7249620"," aren't going to sell and move to their next house,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7250500","7251780"," they're not going to do it, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7251780","7252420"," Why would you?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7252420","7255380"," Why would you move to your next house to, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7255380","7260020"," to basically laugh at your, uh, what, what you've paid"
"axndAqK5BgI","7260580","7264420"," and take a mortgage now that's higher at 40 or 50,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7264420","7267700"," why would you take another 30-year mortgage at a higher rate"
"axndAqK5BgI","7267700","7271460"," at 55 years old just to move up to another house?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7271460","7272740"," So people are doing it."
"axndAqK5BgI","7272740","7276420"," We considered selling, uh, selling here in Detroit."
"axndAqK5BgI","7276420","7277460"," And then we stopped."
"axndAqK5BgI","7277460","7280660"," We were like, we're like, we have to keep these houses without a doubt."
"axndAqK5BgI","7280660","7281780"," We can't get rid of them."
"axndAqK5BgI","7282820","7283620"," Yeah, we can."
"axndAqK5BgI","7283620","7284500"," We're holding them."
"axndAqK5BgI","7284500","7286900"," Well, my old people are sitting on their houses."
"axndAqK5BgI","7287540","7290500"," My oldest, so my oldest is where we think"
"axndAqK5BgI","7291540","7295300"," will be eligible for a full ride to University of Michigan."
"axndAqK5BgI","7295300","7300100"," She'll be applying, of course, to like Stanford and schools like that."
"axndAqK5BgI","7300100","7302260"," But if she doesn't get a full ride,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7303620","7307700"," uh, I'm like, I'm like, do I want to pay that money for her to go there,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7309700","7311940"," to be debt ridden for the rest of her life?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7312900","7316980"," Um, for her university degree, or does she go to, like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7316980","7320180"," University of Michigan at a free ride and she can go stay in one of these"
"axndAqK5BgI","7320900","7321940"," houses for free."
"axndAqK5BgI","7322500","7324740"," I think that's the only leg she's going to get up, I think."
"axndAqK5BgI","7325860","7326420"," Absolutely."
"axndAqK5BgI","7326420","7326820"," Great school."
"axndAqK5BgI","7327620","7330100"," It's like one of the best engineering schools in the U.S."
"axndAqK5BgI","7330100","7334100"," So, um, I don't know what to say to her."
"axndAqK5BgI","7334820","7336980"," You've got kids that are just slightly younger than mine."
"axndAqK5BgI","7336980","7337940"," What do you say to your kids?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7338500","7339620"," You were saying it's me the other day."
"axndAqK5BgI","7339620","7341940"," You have to buy a house now, just in case for them."
"axndAqK5BgI","7343060","7347540"," Yeah, it's like having a, it's like having a token, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7347540","7351140"," Like you've got like, I've got a, I've got a token in the system"
"axndAqK5BgI","7351140","7354740"," so that it will appreciate it with property over the next,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7355460","7358740"," you know, 10 years while they go to college and get older"
"axndAqK5BgI","7358740","7362180"," so that they're not coming in 10 years down the line with property"
"axndAqK5BgI","7362740","7367140"," where it has inflated basically completely beyond the reach of most kids"
"axndAqK5BgI","7367700","7370580"," when they come out of school and decide to get married."
"axndAqK5BgI","7370580","7373860"," Like, I mean, just imagine everyone laughs at California"
"axndAqK5BgI","7373860","7378980"," with the cost of housing there and goes, well, yeah, I would never pay"
"axndAqK5BgI","7378980","7382260"," two million dollars for 1600 square feet."
"axndAqK5BgI","7382260","7385380"," Like they do in, you know, like LA or Southern LA."
"axndAqK5BgI","7385380","7387780"," It's like, well, get ready for that shit to come to your house."
"axndAqK5BgI","7387780","7391780"," Like to your town, because look at it, if we keep going where we are right now,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7391780","7394900"," we're housing in the part of the country I live in,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7394900","7398340"," which is like way northeast of downtown Atlanta."
"axndAqK5BgI","7399700","7405380"," Like the cost of housing is up 40% in the last, say, three years."
"axndAqK5BgI","7406340","7412100"," I mean, a house that I sold, you know, back in, you know, 2015"
"axndAqK5BgI","7412740","7417140"," has sold recently for two and a half times what I sold it for."
"axndAqK5BgI","7417220","7419860"," Like, that's insane. That is insane."
"axndAqK5BgI","7421620","7423540"," You know, it's not going to change."
"axndAqK5BgI","7423540","7426420"," It's not going to change because people aren't going to get out of their"
"axndAqK5BgI","7426420","7429540"," two percent mortgage and inflation is going to continue."
"axndAqK5BgI","7429540","7432580"," So, you know, more dollars are going to be needed."
"axndAqK5BgI","7433300","7438260"," Yeah, I used to live in Santa Monica, California right when it became like a hipster town."
"axndAqK5BgI","7438980","7444900"," Those, these shitbox cigar houses, they're not really cigar houses,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7444900","7446980"," but they're like a shoebox."
"axndAqK5BgI","7448180","7452500"," They were a million dollar homes then, and I'm like, this was in 2000."
"axndAqK5BgI","7452500","7458020"," I can't even imagine what a house would cost on the beach in Santa Monica today."
"axndAqK5BgI","7458020","7459220"," It would have to be millions."
"axndAqK5BgI","7459860","7466500"," I bet that absolutely then is probably now worth, I don't know, five, six million dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","7467540","7471300"," A total shitbox condo in Santa Monica would be millions now."
"axndAqK5BgI","7471300","7476660"," I mean, you know, if it could afford to exist because, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7476660","7483140"," there's such demand for limited real estate like, you know, on the beach in Santa Monica,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7483140","7489140"," where people would want to have extremely expensive homes, and so they'll buy up that"
"axndAqK5BgI","7489140","7492180"," three million dollar condo and all the other ones next to it,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7492180","7495540"," knock it down and build luxury premium condos."
"axndAqK5BgI","7496420","7501940"," And so, you know, further taking your children away from ever possibly owning a home."
"axndAqK5BgI","7502500","7507300"," That's what my, that's what our thing is, is I have real fear that they won't be able to afford"
"axndAqK5BgI","7507300","7512100"," a home. Like, or even like a, it's bizarre because I'm like, even the fact that even"
"axndAqK5BgI","7512100","7516500"," think this stuff is bizarre, to me at least, I'm like, I can't believe that I'm going to be"
"axndAqK5BgI","7516500","7518820"," holding this stuff for 20, 30 years."
"axndAqK5BgI","7520340","7521460"," And this is the fair."
"axndAqK5BgI","7521460","7523300"," The fair is, do I ever get hurt?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7524100","7529540"," Do I die? Like, if I'm, like, I'm a sailor, I want to go sail the world, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7529540","7531460"," Let's say I fall off the boat and I die."
"axndAqK5BgI","7533460","7534980"," What does, what does my wife do?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7534980","7535860"," What does my kids do?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7535860","7540900"," If I can't help my kids up one day when they need a lift, what if my daughter gets a divorce"
"axndAqK5BgI","7540900","7543700"," and she's got kids and she can't take care of herself?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7543700","7547060"," What if, um, it uses all kinds of these what ifs, right?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7547060","7552020"," What if my, my wife and I both die and I've got nothing to give to my kids?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7552660","7556660"," Um, of that's like scaling up over time."
"axndAqK5BgI","7556660","7561940"," That's beating, beating inflation, um, an appreciating asset."
"axndAqK5BgI","7563460","7565220"," I don't know how they do it on their own."
"axndAqK5BgI","7565220","7570660"," If, if, if, if we're here right now, what are, where are we going to be in 10 or 20 years?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7572260","7573140"," I don't know where that is."
"axndAqK5BgI","7573140","7578500"," If we, if we don't break the back of inflation on the dollar, then"
"axndAqK5BgI","7579460","7582020"," you know, we're going to be in a problematic place."
"axndAqK5BgI","7584020","7587460"," I mean, that's, you know, that, that's, that's it."
"axndAqK5BgI","7587460","7590980"," We've got to, we've got to break the back of inflation on the dollar."
"axndAqK5BgI","7591540","7597300"," And I mean, they, they, they, they want 2%, but, you know, right now,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7597300","7600580"," we're not trending towards that for a very long time."
"axndAqK5BgI","7600580","7605860"," We have to get interest rates above the rate of inflation and hold them there"
"axndAqK5BgI","7605860","7607380"," for six months to a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","7608100","7609140"," And so we do that."
"axndAqK5BgI","7609860","7615220"," And if we're not, and if inflation is being sticky and it's, it's looking like it is,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7615220","7620580"," and it's not going to go back down, then we have no choice but to raise interest rates"
"axndAqK5BgI","7620580","7625300"," above inflation rather than waiting for inflation to come down to get below interest rates."
"axndAqK5BgI","7625300","7626260"," Cause that's not happening."
"axndAqK5BgI","7626900","7627860"," I don't believe them."
"axndAqK5BgI","7627860","7628820"," I think that they're lying."
"axndAqK5BgI","7628820","7633060"," I think that they know, I think that they know that there's an aspect to this"
"axndAqK5BgI","7634740","7636900"," that some companies aren't going to budge on."
"axndAqK5BgI","7636900","7639140"," I don't like the egg guy that's bacon eggs."
"axndAqK5BgI","7640260","7642180"," I think he's like, you know, it's six bucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","7643060","7644740"," I don't care if inflation comes down."
"axndAqK5BgI","7644740","7645620"," It's six bucks now."
"axndAqK5BgI","7645620","7646820"," I'm never changing."
"axndAqK5BgI","7646820","7647780"," I don't trust you."
"axndAqK5BgI","7649220","7653940"," I would be like that because they know they can't change their prices again for another decade."
"axndAqK5BgI","7653940","7655940"," So if you're just looking at this, like a bell weather,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7656500","7660820"," if you're looking at eggs and you're like, why are they six or seven dollars right now?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7660820","7661780"," Why are they eight bucks?"
"axndAqK5BgI","7663060","7665220"," They're telling you, the egg producers saying,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7666100","7669940"," I know this story that you're telling me, your fight and inflation."
"axndAqK5BgI","7669940","7673540"," I know this story that you're telling me that you're going to do this and you're going to do that."
"axndAqK5BgI","7674180","7677860"," But I'm telling you in a decade, thanks will be seven bucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","7677860","7680340"," And I'll be making it by then."
"axndAqK5BgI","7680340","7681300"," We have our next event."
"axndAqK5BgI","7681860","7683620"," We're going to have to raise the price of eggs again."
"axndAqK5BgI","7684260","7689140"," And it's, it's scary because you not, not the, not free range eggs,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7689140","7690020"," but they used to be eggs."
"axndAqK5BgI","7690020","7694020"," You could get in a store that were like a dollar, dollar,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7694020","7695940"," point nine, maybe dollar nine."
"axndAqK5BgI","7697300","7701780"," Dude, it was right before COVID, right before COVID."
"axndAqK5BgI","7701780","7703140"," I shit you not."
"axndAqK5BgI","7703140","7706820"," You could get eggs on Amazon Prime where I live."
"axndAqK5BgI","7707620","7712020"," You could go online and buy them delivered from Amazon Fresh."
"axndAqK5BgI","7712020","7714980"," And it was $2.90 a dozen."
"axndAqK5BgI","7714980","7716900"," And that was in 2019."
"axndAqK5BgI","7716900","7718180"," Like we're not talking about."
"axndAqK5BgI","7719140","7722260"," Forever ago, that was 20 fucking 19."
"axndAqK5BgI","7723620","7731220"," And now, you know, now we're dealing with, you know, with eggs being at like five and six dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","7731220","7732340"," I say for seven, eight bucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","7733380","7734420"," Seven, eight dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","7734420","7734980"," I do."
"axndAqK5BgI","7734980","7735540"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","7735540","7743460"," The, so the eggs in my stores that are free range are cheaper than the mass produced eggs right now."
"axndAqK5BgI","7744980","7745540"," They're cheaper."
"axndAqK5BgI","7746340","7747140"," Cheaper."
"axndAqK5BgI","7747140","7750660"," And I'm like, you know that there's some guy there or some woman,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7750660","7752180"," whoever is back there going."
"axndAqK5BgI","7753060","7754820"," I don't fucking believe any of these people."
"axndAqK5BgI","7755620","7758420"," I know for a fact that I'm going to be charted, they want there."
"axndAqK5BgI","7758420","7762580"," I can tell there's some guy that it's like, look, if I raise the price of,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7762580","7766420"," or lower the price of eggs down at two back to two dollars or three dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","7767700","7769220"," Someone's going to run for office."
"axndAqK5BgI","7770180","7774660"," They're going to talk about, I don't know, whatever Reagan was saying."
"axndAqK5BgI","7774660","7777380"," And we're going to, we're going to rip faces off with that again."
"axndAqK5BgI","7777380","7779700"," And we're going to rip faces off of inflation."
"axndAqK5BgI","7779700","7781220"," We're going to devalue the dollar."
"axndAqK5BgI","7781860","7786020"," And I'm going to be standing here not being able to raise the price of eggs back to seven bucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","7786020","7790820"," I'm going to get yelled at because there's no event to, to, to justify it, which this is."
"axndAqK5BgI","7790820","7791780"," COVID was the event."
"axndAqK5BgI","7791780","7792340"," Right."
"axndAqK5BgI","7792340","7794580"," To be like, I'm sorry, we have to raise the price of eggs."
"axndAqK5BgI","7795940","7796180"," Sure."
"axndAqK5BgI","7797060","7802740"," That was your, like say, that's our once every 20 years reason why we could like truly inflate"
"axndAqK5BgI","7802740","7807860"," the cost and they'll go up higher than they needed to because they won't be able to do it again"
"axndAqK5BgI","7807860","7809540"," until the next event."
"axndAqK5BgI","7809540","7813620"," Yeah, people are like, why, why do you think they're not, why, why don't you think it's"
"axndAqK5BgI","7813620","7818580"," not coming down and I go, because they aren't allowed to raise their prices."
"axndAqK5BgI","7818580","7825380"," When you go to the store, there's like a ground hamburger meat and you expect it to be a specific"
"axndAqK5BgI","7825380","7831700"," price until you're forced into a new price, tear for it until you're forced to accept the new pricing"
"axndAqK5BgI","7831700","7832020"," for it."
"axndAqK5BgI","7833220","7834820"," So you'll, you'll be like, I want it on sale."
"axndAqK5BgI","7834820","7837460"," I'm not paying $8 for hamburger meat today."
"axndAqK5BgI","7837460","7838020"," You're crazy."
"axndAqK5BgI","7838020","7841540"," It's normally three bucks a pound or five bucks a pound."
"axndAqK5BgI","7841540","7843140"," And I'm not paying an extra three bucks."
"axndAqK5BgI","7844820","7848180"," But you know, you used to cost the dollar for hamburger."
"axndAqK5BgI","7848180","7852340"," Then before that, it was 30 cents for hamburger, 10 cents for hamburger."
"axndAqK5BgI","7854180","7859220"," So this is their, they're, they're foreseeing the future that a, a, a life of inflation."
"axndAqK5BgI","7859940","7861860"," In my view, they always, they always have."
"axndAqK5BgI","7862260","7865380"," That's why we're here at, this time is different."
"axndAqK5BgI","7867780","7870340"," What's really funny is we were at this place."
"axndAqK5BgI","7870900","7877860"," So like we were at the place where inflation was bad, but we had become accustomed to inflation at"
"axndAqK5BgI","7877860","7878900"," the levels it was at."
"axndAqK5BgI","7880980","7885060"," Because I mean, if you look, if you look at that chart that we were describing earlier,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7885060","7889540"," the reverse apple chart, where, you know, the dollar used to be worth something and now it's"
"axndAqK5BgI","7889540","7890500"," like worth nothing."
"axndAqK5BgI","7891140","7899940"," In 2017 and 18 and 19, the dollar was still worth less and less and less each year."
"axndAqK5BgI","7900500","7902180"," It was just happening at it."
"axndAqK5BgI","7902180","7907940"," Yeah, it was just happening at a slow enough pace so that you and me would just go, well,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7907940","7914180"," you know, a fucking cheeseburger at McDonald's cost an extra eight cents this year versus what it"
"axndAqK5BgI","7914180","7915060"," was last year."
"axndAqK5BgI","7915540","7919300"," But now suddenly you finally, it goes up enough."
"axndAqK5BgI","7919300","7923620"," It's spiked hard enough for everyone to wake up and go, holy shit."
"axndAqK5BgI","7924420","7928180"," A cheeseburger went up a dollar and they all went, wow, you know,"
"axndAqK5BgI","7928180","7934020"," now the cost of me surviving and my family surviving has exploded."
"axndAqK5BgI","7934020","7942020"," So now we might get used to this new regime of dollar inflation, but it's not like it's new."
"axndAqK5BgI","7942020","7944660"," It's not like something fundamental has changed."
"axndAqK5BgI","7944660","7948900"," We always have had inflation ever since, you know, ever since the dollar went off"
"axndAqK5BgI","7948900","7954420"," of a gold standard and we have been basically destroying the value of the money sitting in"
"axndAqK5BgI","7954420","7955380"," your bank account."
"axndAqK5BgI","7955380","7963300"," Or as it was described to me in my economics class is they turned the dollar into cheese"
"axndAqK5BgI","7963300","7965620"," and cheese goes bad sitting on your counter."
"axndAqK5BgI","7966020","7970740"," It forces people to not hoard cheese and instead to eat the cheese."
"axndAqK5BgI","7970740","7976420"," So it goes all the way back to basic economics."
"axndAqK5BgI","7976420","7981940"," When we turn the dollar into a product that goes bad, that it becomes worthless"
"axndAqK5BgI","7982900","7987220"," every single day, it encourages people to do spending."
"axndAqK5BgI","7988340","7995620"," And it has or to buy assets if you make enough of it, but not many people on a percentage basis"
"axndAqK5BgI","7995620","7999220"," make enough money to purchase assets that are durable."
"axndAqK5BgI","7999220","8003860"," Most people, the most durable asset they'll ever own in their entire lifetime"
"axndAqK5BgI","8003860","8006580"," is number one, a car, which becomes like cheese."
"axndAqK5BgI","8006580","8011220"," And number two, a house is assuming they ever get enough together for a payment,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8011220","8013540"," which not many people do anymore."
"axndAqK5BgI","8013540","8019460"," So, you know, it basically turns people instead of becoming sovereign and able to"
"axndAqK5BgI","8019460","8020980"," like maintain their own wealth."
"axndAqK5BgI","8020980","8024180"," Get a mortgage, take some equity out over it."
"axndAqK5BgI","8024180","8026180"," We are tax system is built around that."
"axndAqK5BgI","8027380","8031860"," Our taxes are built is built around you getting married, having children buying a house"
"axndAqK5BgI","8031860","8034980"," and then it should happen."
"axndAqK5BgI","8034980","8039220"," And one of these cycles and they take it all away from you again and turn it over to the next"
"axndAqK5BgI","8039220","8041220"," generation and we don't do that."
"axndAqK5BgI","8041220","8048340"," If you ever get wealthy enough to pass on wealth to your family such that they"
"axndAqK5BgI","8049140","8056420"," don't have to participate in the system, that is a anomaly and it was a mistake."
"axndAqK5BgI","8056420","8061300"," And something went wrong or really, really right for you."
"axndAqK5BgI","8062260","8064980"," I'm not a naysayer guy."
"axndAqK5BgI","8064980","8068660"," Anyone that follows me on Twitter knows that I'm not like Mr. Deoming Loom."
"axndAqK5BgI","8068660","8070260"," But by God, it's true."
"axndAqK5BgI","8070260","8077300"," I mean, you look at our financial system, it is built to create a people who work their entire lives,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8078500","8080980"," entire lives, just to survive."
"axndAqK5BgI","8081620","8086100"," And then at the end, you should have zero dollars left."
"axndAqK5BgI","8086100","8087540"," Yeah, they rug pull your ass on."
"axndAqK5BgI","8087540","8089380"," That's the anyone that's the rug pull you."
"axndAqK5BgI","8089380","8089540"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8090420","8095140"," And the way they do that is by, you know, it used to be the way they would do that is through"
"axndAqK5BgI","8095140","8098740"," like horrible levies of taxes, like death taxes and stuff."
"axndAqK5BgI","8098740","8102820"," But they found out it's way easier just to turn the money into fucking chews."
"axndAqK5BgI","8104020","8109060"," It's so that right now, it was really funny."
"axndAqK5BgI","8109060","8112500"," I asked, what is enough money to retire on Twitter not long ago?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8112500","8116020"," And I asked the question, just put it and put a pull out."
"axndAqK5BgI","8116020","8121220"," And I was like, do you think you can retire on one million dollars?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8121220","8124900"," And then I said, do you think you can retire on three million dollars?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8126020","8128820"," And then I said, do you think you can retire on 10 million dollars?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8129700","8135460"," You would be surprised that the majority of people said one million dollars would be okay."
"axndAqK5BgI","8135460","8139380"," And I'm like, do you realize that at three percent,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8140180","8146180"," which, you know, you back out, back out the last 15 years and just look at the last five"
"axndAqK5BgI","8146820","8148980"," on three percent gains on spy."
"axndAqK5BgI","8148980","8153780"," Are you going to be able to live on $30,000 a year before you pay taxes on it?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8153780","8162980"," No, no, and would that even outrun the inflation of two to three percent"
"axndAqK5BgI","8163540","8168820"," that the Fed is targeting or the inflation of five to six percent"
"axndAqK5BgI","8168820","8172420"," that the Fed is currently dealing with at its best."
"axndAqK5BgI","8173220","8178180"," Fuck no, you're slowly, your money is becoming cheese, sitting on the counter,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8178180","8181220"," going bad. You are losing money every year."
"axndAqK5BgI","8181220","8184420"," Guess what happens to people that lose money every year that don't work?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8184420","8185540"," They end up poor."
"axndAqK5BgI","8186340","8192100"," So you have no choice, but the rest of the most of the world still is living that"
"axndAqK5BgI","8192180","8197460"," 1990s, 1980s world where they're like, dude, a million dollars is a lot of money."
"axndAqK5BgI","8197460","8198500"," It's like, sorry, buddy."
"axndAqK5BgI","8199060","8199860"," That's nothing."
"axndAqK5BgI","8199860","8204100"," And I mean, I realize I'm saying that from my fucking boat and take that away."
"axndAqK5BgI","8204660","8209380"," It doesn't matter. A million dollars, if you want to retire and we're going to have"
"axndAqK5BgI","8209380","8217220"," persistent five percent inflation means you better die really fast after you retire, but really fast."
"axndAqK5BgI","8217940","8224420"," I don't know. I think my our electric heat bill for this last month,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8224420","8232660"," or I know you don't live in the cold parts, but they just raised all of our like all of our"
"axndAqK5BgI","8232660","8236100"," utility bills here. It was last month was lower."
"axndAqK5BgI","8236100","8240100"," I think we got it down to like five or six hundred, but the start of the winter,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8240100","8244180"," we were buying 800 a month post to it like, oh, I'll check."
"axndAqK5BgI","8244900","8248020"," But I think it was seven or eight hundred. My wife came to me and she was like,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8249380","8252260"," our bill in our house is eight hundred dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","8252260","8253940"," And I was like, what did you say?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8253940","8254580"," Oh, yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8254580","8255460"," We have a."
"axndAqK5BgI","8255460","8261780"," Yeah, my power bill in the summer has gone up an average of like $60 a year per month."
"axndAqK5BgI","8261780","8268660"," So like each month, each year in the summer, the monthly power bill has gone up about $60"
"axndAqK5BgI","8268660","8271380"," more than the previous month last year."
"axndAqK5BgI","8271460","8275780"," We're at eight hundred dollars right now on a single family home with."
"axndAqK5BgI","8277700","8282660"," You know, it's three living floors and then it's not huge."
"axndAqK5BgI","8282660","8286900"," It's a 17 plus another seven or something like that."
"axndAqK5BgI","8287620","8288580"," So what is that?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8288580","8291940"," Yeah, four hundred square feet of living space and it's on top of each other."
"axndAqK5BgI","8291940","8293380"," So it's not like it's all spread out."
"axndAqK5BgI","8294660","8296100"," Right. He rises."
"axndAqK5BgI","8296100","8299140"," He rises and I'm like, I'm like, I'm like eight hundred a month."
"axndAqK5BgI","8299140","8304020"," I'm like, I'm like, if I had a job right now working for a McDonald's, let's say."
"axndAqK5BgI","8305940","8306820"," Not even McDonald's."
"axndAqK5BgI","8306820","8311220"," If you had a job working, just working at one of the factories for GM nearby."
"axndAqK5BgI","8312660","8313220"," That's a pay."
"axndAqK5BgI","8313220","8315380"," And you suddenly got hit with utilities."
"axndAqK5BgI","8315380","8315780"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8315780","8316100"," Hey, check."
"axndAqK5BgI","8316820","8317300"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8317300","8320340"," Eight hundred dollars after tax is power company."
"axndAqK5BgI","8320340","8322020"," You don't give a fuck about your tax."
"axndAqK5BgI","8322020","8322580"," What is that?"
"axndAqK5BgI","8322580","8324580"," That would be a thousand a year."
"axndAqK5BgI","8324580","8328740"," You'd have no, well, you're fifty six thousand dollar job or something or fifty two thousand"
"axndAqK5BgI","8328740","8329140"," dollars."
"axndAqK5BgI","8329140","8329700"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8329700","8331140"," Fifty two thousand bucks a week."
"axndAqK5BgI","8331140","8334260"," Let's say for, you know, and you get, they say you get a couple of weeks and they're"
"axndAqK5BgI","8334260","8339220"," thrown in, but for free for vacation that you didn't take because you're on PTO or something."
"axndAqK5BgI","8339220","8340820"," You rolled it over and just took the money."
"axndAqK5BgI","8340820","8341220"," I don't know."
"axndAqK5BgI","8341860","8348340"," So you get a quarter of that goes to just your utilities."
"axndAqK5BgI","8348340","8353940"," That's not phones, your insurances, your medical and your dental and"
"axndAqK5BgI","8354740","8355940"," that's not groceries."
"axndAqK5BgI","8355940","8358100"," That's not, yeah, that's not groceries."
"axndAqK5BgI","8358100","8359380"," That's not your doctor bill."
"axndAqK5BgI","8359380","8361460"," That's not your, you know, anything."
"axndAqK5BgI","8361460","8363460"," So, you know, at this point,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8363460","8365780"," stupid, it's stupid."
"axndAqK5BgI","8365780","8368980"," At this point, it's, it's, it's crazy."
"axndAqK5BgI","8368980","8373220"," I mean, and I see like, you know, hop, hopstetter said, you know, it depends on if you have a pension."
"axndAqK5BgI","8373700","8376260"," Bro, there are no pensions in the United States."
"axndAqK5BgI","8376260","8381460"," Unless you are a teacher and a member of the union, there are no pensions anymore."
"axndAqK5BgI","8381540","8386820"," Like I remember the days, like where grandparents were on pensions where they,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8386820","8392180"," you know, they basically got to either take it, take it and get a larger amount,"
"axndAqK5BgI","8392180","8396980"," but then it ended when they died or take a smaller amount and then their spouse would"
"axndAqK5BgI","8396980","8398580"," get it until they die."
"axndAqK5BgI","8398580","8400420"," And those types of setups are gone."
"axndAqK5BgI","8400420","8401780"," Like that was my grandparents."
"axndAqK5BgI","8401780","8406020"," That's, that's people that are 90 and 80 plus years old in America."
"axndAqK5BgI","8406020","8406180"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8406180","8408340"," There are no kind of pensions here."
"axndAqK5BgI","8408340","8410020"," And they do, they do great on this pension."
"axndAqK5BgI","8411220","8412260"," They're well, well, well."
"axndAqK5BgI","8412260","8412420"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8412420","8412500"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8412500","8413460"," Pinchings were great."
"axndAqK5BgI","8414500","8415140"," Very well."
"axndAqK5BgI","8415140","8417060"," You know, they don't realize that they're a very well."
"axndAqK5BgI","8417060","8419620"," But this, or not, I think it's my generation."
"axndAqK5BgI","8421300","8422340"," Nowhere near the."
"axndAqK5BgI","8424740","8429300"," I worked at two companies that had pensions for older employees that had cancelled them"
"axndAqK5BgI","8429300","8430340"," by the time I started."
"axndAqK5BgI","8430900","8435860"," So like the, the pensions were gone for, you know, for newer employees."
"axndAqK5BgI","8435860","8439940"," Like they were, they had, they had ended them about a year and a half before I started."
"axndAqK5BgI","8439940","8440420"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8440420","8441220"," And they were gone."
"axndAqK5BgI","8441220","8445700"," They're like, these are not an option because we don't want to have to support you or ensure"
"axndAqK5BgI","8445700","8448100"," any kind of like cost of living adjustments."
"axndAqK5BgI","8448100","8450580"," And they went to like standard 401Ks."
"axndAqK5BgI","8450580","8452260"," And that's what companies want to do."
"axndAqK5BgI","8452820","8453060"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8453860","8460260"," 401K, they, you know, they're like, look, we, we, we front load all of the risk by adding money on a"
"axndAqK5BgI","8460260","8461060"," yearly basis."
"axndAqK5BgI","8461140","8466020"," We don't worry about hyperinflation in 30 years because that's not our problem."
"axndAqK5BgI","8466580","8466660"," Yeah."
"axndAqK5BgI","8466660","8468420"," And that's, that's smart."
"axndAqK5BgI","8468420","8472980"," Like companies that do that are smart because they're like, look, money is going to continue to"
"axndAqK5BgI","8474180","8476660"," devalue at a huge rate."
"axndAqK5BgI","8477220","8480020"," We don't want to have to."
"axndAqK5BgI","8481940","8482980"," That we're losing, Jeff."
"axndAqK5BgI","8484900","8485220"," Okay."
"axndAqK5BgI","8485220","8486100"," So we're going to wrap it up."
"axndAqK5BgI","8486660","8488180"," I'll check you guys out tomorrow."
"axndAqK5BgI","8488180","8490420"," Any of you that stuck around for the rest of this broadcast, thanks."
