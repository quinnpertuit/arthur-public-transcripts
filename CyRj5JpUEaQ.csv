"16640","18780"," level, before the film begins."
"133110","136150"," Holy shit, Verizon, you dirty dog. "
"140430","142350"," Verizon, what the fuck are you doing?"
"145950","148770"," Alright, I got crap I gotta do here."
"158380","160720"," So I don't know if I have any viewers in here or not."
"165520","169700"," Hello, hello, happy Friday to all of you out there, if anybody's watching right now, if you're just"
"169700","171200"," joining us, if you're watching this later. "
"172600","182600"," Anyone can subscribers, can comment, anyone that wants to comment, can comment, this is what"
"182600","183340"," I got going on there."
"184880","193830"," I should have like this, I should have like this screen up while, let's make sure I got this right."
"202250","202950"," Okay, we're good. "
"205450","206590"," I think we're good."
"207510","209830"," Let's get rid of the main screen, switch over here."
"210670","219070"," Okay, what is going on, like I'm missing. "
"223710","228350"," What in the fuck is going on here?"
"238840","239900"," Do you activate?"
"245020","246540"," Okay, we're back again."
"255899","257420"," Hey, what's up, Virgo, I can see you."
"258820","260660"," Good morning, Virgo and Brian Smith. "
"261460","261900"," How are you?"
"262800","264340"," Sorry if you're just joining it right now."
"265660","268540"," Let me see if I, let me see if I post this inside of a discord."
"269860","271280"," One quick second here. "
"271740","273000"," Dude, what is going on with this?"
"275920","279100"," I don't know, I don't know what the fuck is going on with this."
"279620","287740"," I think I allowed everyone to comment this morning, so let's"
"287740","290420"," start with this here."
"292580","293780"," I got some weirdness. "
"293780","299040"," I had to like sign out and then sign back in for just YouTube and not switch today."
"299040","318720"," I don't know"
"318720","320140"," what is going on with this."
"339300","342000"," Yeah, I've got some walking that's going on with the stream in the background. "
"342760","344480"," So I don't know what the fuck is going on."
"345020","347520"," Okay, we're going to, this is the third."
"348620","349460"," Hey, what's going on?"
"349520","349720"," Come out. "
"349840","350040"," How are you?"
"351320","352020"," Could be back."
"352240","356340"," So this is, we're going to make the, I'm going to start this stream because I have another meeting"
"356340","357320"," at 12 people."
"357840","362460"," I've got, I don't know if I have a meeting with Quinn and Joe, but I have another meeting too"
"362460","365240"," around 12 that I have to get to between 12 and four. "
"365740","370780"," So I make this short and not short and sweet, but probably an hour, hopefully an hour, an hour, an"
"370780","372140"," half, two hours, something like that."
"372140","380900"," And we'll do like the third part of this series of recorded videos for members inside the discord."
"381600","390360"," The first, the first one that I made was on, I don't remember, it was the 27th or 28th, something"
"390360","390860"," like that. "
"391060","395480"," And then another one on, I believe the 15th, I'm not sure."
"395480","402020"," This is going to be the third and final video, I think, in that series, but we have a lot"
"402020","402680"," to go over."
"404420","408900"," We have a lot to go over as a finale to the series as well. "
"409200","412780"," So we're going to get right to it and we're going to take a look around the market."
"413420","418400"," Is this, I guess the big question is, is this the end of the correction?"
"418780","420140"," This is the spy right now."
"421040","423180"," Is this the end of the correction for the spy?"
"423180","424820"," It's likely not. "
"427260","429780"," And we're going to go, let's go ahead and go to a full screen here."
"431220","431740"," I got it."
"431880","433660"," I got some stuff I got to do here in the background. "
"434840","435980"," Let's go ahead and go to a full screen."
"438120","438440"," Perfect."
"439300","439920"," Hey, what's going on?"
"440400","440960"," What's going on?"
"441060","441200"," What's going on?"
"441360","441980"," Buckburgy's media. "
"442780","443040"," Ross rocks."
"443180","443720"," What's going on?"
"443900","444420"," Good to see you too."
"446100","448180"," So we're just going to get started right now. "
"448180","452840"," I can be here for two hours, something like that, like 12 o'clock somewhere around there."
"454740","455860"," Yeah, good to see you too."
"456240","457720"," Voice is doing much better. "
"458200","467100"," So we're going to take the third part of a private video series for Discord."
"468100","471080"," We did one video, I think, two or three weeks ago."
"471300","473260"," We did another video last weekend, I believe. "
"473740","475240"," And then this is going to be the final one."
"475240","478800"," And I don't have the time to actually do this video over the weekend."
"479100","482580"," So Saturday and Sunday, I can't make this video. "
"482680","484900"," And I stopped live streaming this week after Monday's closed."
"485680","490160"," I was having nothing to do with the live stream this week going into that closing one."
"490220","491360"," It would have lost a lot of money. "
"492100","493980"," So I was like, you know what, this goes up and into the bell."
"494120","496020"," We're going to stop the live stream to the week to take a vacation."
"496520","497920"," I have other shit I got to do too. "
"498560","500460"," I've got kids going back to school."
"501060","506800"," And I have some brokerages that have to switch over to a prime bank."
"507140","511299"," And I've got a bunch of crap like tutoring, all kinds of stupid stuff getting ready for school. "
"511500","513500"," So it's like, you know what, take the time, take the week off."
"514360","516900"," We'll come back and just do that video for the weekend."
"517400","524740"," So this is going to be the last video for the members only inside the Discord in regards to a"
"524740","528840"," correction or a corrective action. "
"528840","532900"," So we're going to look at, I was looking at this and we're going to look at the trigger screen"
"532900","533280"," first."
"534200","536040"," We're going to take a look around the market here."
"537860","542140"," Now, when I first said to you this morning was, is the correction over?"
"542780","544140"," This is ES right now. "
"544340","545680"," It likely is not."
"546080","549080"," It's possible that it is, but it's likely that it's not."
"550160","552020"," We still haven't tagged this lower zone. "
"552760","561020"," If we were to tag this today, it'd be 430, 430, 0475 on ES"
"561020","563580"," on spy."
"564000","566560"," And we're going to look at next week too and see."
"569200","573200"," We're going to look at next week and see we are trading right now above the one in five minute. "
"574080","575760"," We've been selling off of."
"575760","579640"," I've been selling off of this half hour right here."
"579680","580480"," I want to show you this. "
"580700","586040"," So this half hour on ES, we've been selling off and this full hour we've been selling off as well."
"586620","588160"," I'm not 30 minutes right now."
"589700","590680"," 30 minute here. "
"593640","597320"," Still haven't hit the lower target down below here."
"597560","601240"," So for this week, for today, it's 126 on spy."
"601240","607080"," I still believe that we get there, even if we were to pull up today. "
"607780","610500"," To 435 or 448."
"611900","616500"," Or even if we were to trade up to 444, 443 zone."
"616940","620240"," I still think we're where we have more down to go. "
"620260","622000"," And I'm going to show you why here in just a moment."
"623120","626640"," Why I think we can actually get down into this into this zone."
"626820","629060"," We're going to go over, but we got to go over a bunch of stuff. "
"629060","630640"," I guess I got to get right into it."
"630900","633120"," As it's like, it's all rolling through my brain right now."
"633180","634860"," I got to get through a ton of crap today. "
"635580","638000"," So we're going to go through a ton of crap today."
"638820","640700"," One other concern that I have here."
"641040","642280"," Let me see if I can switch charts here. "
"643020","644820"," Give me one quick second here."
"647760","649160"," Just one quick second."
"649540","651240"," We have so much stuff to go through. "
"651340","651860"," It's not even funny."
"655240","658840"," I don't know why I wasn't on the 30 minute chart there to begin with."
"660900","664600"," No, no, no, no, no. "
"667520","669280"," One quick second here."
"676990","678730"," T4 daily chart."
"679150","679770"," Let's have that one. "
"681250","681930"," Okay."
"685050","687870"," We're going to take a look at a spy here."
"688210","688930"," I'm going to bring this up. "
"694380","699260"," So this is the T4 daily chart."
"699660","708640"," So this chart right here is what I use to see if we're crashing, if we're correcting."
"709220","716300"," So when I made that first video, I was like, hey, if you wake up to a correction, I don't"
"716300","717440"," know if it's the daily or the weekly. "
"718540","720000"," Don't be surprised, right?"
"720300","723540"," Don't be surprised if you wake up one day this week and we start correcting."
"724300","728440"," We corrected onto the daily and now are correcting down to the weekly."
"729680","738300"," One positive right now is that the daily trigger is not violently following price. "
"739320","740240"," That's positive."
"740440","743000"," HIG and the overnight looked really good as well."
"743360","746780"," So we're not seeing quite yet like, hey, we're going to crash. "
"747740","749680"," It's still just corrective at this point."
"750200","754440"," We are also still inside of trend to the upside."
"754660","759060"," So there's nothing here saying that we've broken trend or anything like that. "
"759620","763520"," We have caught a bid below the lower extremity range."
"764000","765040"," I'm just going to show this to you guys."
"766460","771560"," The lower extremity range right now, we're catching a bid on spoos right now, right?"
"772140","777980"," But even so, would not be shocking to come back down here and test this or even trade sideways for"
"777980","780680"," a little while before resuming an upside move. "
"780980","786200"," Now, there are some things you have to look at about this correction that are concerning to me."
"787060","793040"," And we've got an even lower low here of 423, 27, and the monthly is coming up right now."
"793040","794200"," It's at 406. "
"798880","803400"," Hold on, I've got to, I've got to, I've got to turn this shit off."
"803680","804280"," Hold on a second here."
"804820","806940"," I don't know what the fuck is going on. "
"807040","807560"," Hold on a second here."
"808220","811440"," I've got to turn off this financial juice here."
"814920","819360"," So I've got a whole bunch of questions like Twitter saying they're pro now or something. "
"819700","820680"," I don't know what's going on."
"820680","825860"," Twitter also like kicked me out of Twitter and then sent me back in with like an old tweet deck"
"825860","828640"," from like a year ago or something like that today."
"829520","830980"," There is some concern here. "
"831820","835560"," Not concern for crash, but concern that we're not done going down."
"835760","842520"," Even if we trade higher and reject lower here, but there are some concerns."
"842860","846260"," The first one that I have for concern here is this daily trigger. "
"847320","849440"," This daily trigger is now broken negative."
"850060","857580"," And unless it begins to actually turn around, there could be some, some more down to go before an"
"857580","858920"," even an attempt to go higher."
"859680","862680"," Another issue here is this is September. "
"863880","864220"," Right?"
"864460","867980"," This is October and September is seasonally October."
"868780","870520"," We have some C and sometimes November too."
"870520","874880"," We have some seasonally down time of time of the year, right?"
"875120","881840"," So the next question becomes the window for bulls is pretty much over. "
"882000","883580"," It's not over, but it's pretty much over."
"884020","888140"," It's been a month, but it's August 18th, right?"
"888880","894440"," So we could have a strong fall, but I'll tell you what, it does not."
"895220","900100"," When we broke down here and confirmed this right here, this is normally where the dip would get"
"900100","902360"," bought for that continuation into the fall months. "
"902960","904480"," That did not happen, right?"
"905240","908260"," We're going to roll this into the JPM caller at some point as well."
"908940","912260"," The implications with the with the caller on end of quarter."
"912320","914660"," We're going to take a look at that today in a few moments. "
"915120","917240"," So my point stands here."
"917300","923680"," When I look at previous examples here in the background, once we break that zero line on daily"
"923680","924420"," vella, right?"
"924940","927200"," It's normally not like one or two ticks."
"927200","928600"," Do you see what I'm saying?"
"928800","931420"," You see it takes time over here, time over here. "
"931640","936600"," And now that we've broken down in here, I have the same expectation at this point that even if this"
"936600","941500"," gets bought, even if this goes up, that we're likely not done going down."
"941820","942580"," Okay, make any sense?"
"943460","948280"," Likely not done going down and likely have some work to do to the upside."
"948720","955220"," If there even is in a failure for continuation down into the fall months. "
"955220","958000"," So very concerning for bulls here."
"958440","961720"," Not so concerning if they had held the daily trigger."
"962020","966220"," More concerning that they broke the daily trigger at this time in the year. "
"966780","971480"," Very concerning for where the upside targets are right now."
"971900","976600"," This will likely trigger down the road more panic for bulls."
"976940","979760"," Not quite yet, but likely will down the road. "
"980200","982720"," So someone asked me yesterday, Hey, are we going to crash air?"
"982720","988900"," And no, I don't think that we do crash air, but I do think it sets up for some major"
"988900","990620"," failures heading into the year."
"990940","993580"," You can kiss the 4800 goodbye right now."
"994000","1000060"," I'll explain all the numbers for you with the JPM caller and for Q4, what the expectations would"
"1000060","1000260"," be. "
"1000780","1003340"," We have a magnet now down below it for 20."
"1003980","1009680"," And so I would expect that we might not tag it exactly, but it's going to draw us in like"
"1009680","1010560"," a tractor beam."
"1011200","1013640"," Heading into next month. "
"1014300","1020260"," And if that tractor beam is there into the end of quarter, then you're talking about, you know, 480"
"1020260","1022000"," goes away and you start thinking about Q4."
"1022140","1024940"," And you're like, yeah, we're trading for 20 for 30."
"1025140","1027839"," Can you really get to 480 in Q4?"
"1029020","1032460"," The onus go like onus leaves the bulls at that point. "
"1033240","1037359"," And you start to wonder if not wonder, but it's just the same thing."
"1037359","1037540"," Right?"
"1037599","1041220"," If you held the daily trigger and you had higher, then bulls are in control."
"1041920","1046640"," At this point, you start to look at end of year and start to look at the weakness that comes"
"1046640","1051420"," in to early spring and you go, eh, maybe not, you know, 4800. "
"1051860","1053740"," That's a little out of reach at that point."
"1054540","1057060"," So we're going to take a look at the JPM caller today, SPX."
"1057300","1061220"," We're going to talk about the quarters and the expectations on the quarters and that kind of stuff"
"1061220","1061860"," as we move forward. "
"1061860","1066040"," So just right here, watching this daily fellow down here, not good."
"1066260","1069120"," Usually does not usually does not."
"1069360","1070740"," You can see it right here, right?"
"1070940","1074500"," You've got your initial bounce down and you have more death to come, right?"
"1074720","1078160"," So you get your bounce down and then you have a little bit more, right?"
"1078440","1079980"," And you start to try to climb back. "
"1080840","1082060"," And that does take some time."
"1082120","1083800"," If you look at that, that's May right there."
"1083980","1089360"," That's March right there talking two months of coming back just to fail again. "
"1089360","1092400"," Heading into the new year would be the expectation there."
"1093700","1097080"," And also we haven't hit the zero line on weekly at this point."
"1097800","1103980"," So if this kind of lines up where weekly valo goes back down to zero, now it makes some more"
"1103980","1105120"," sense to me down here. "
"1105240","1109080"," If we're going to get down here, might as well come swooped down in here on daily valo."
"1109380","1110420"," This is spy, by the way."
"1111180","1112900"," Okay, even though you're seeing a bid right now. "
"1113080","1115560"," So we're going to, so this is, so anyways, this point, right?"
"1116660","1122620"," At this point right now, but it does not look good for bulls heading into Q4."
"1123140","1124500"," So we're going to talk about Q4."
"1124760","1127960"," We're going to talk about some other, maybe one quick second here. "
"1143750","1147970"," Next we're going to talk about, so you got, you kind of have that idea right there, right?"
"1148350","1156930"," The next thing that you have to be looking at is the market breadth, the PMO, and also PPO."
"1157410","1162630"," So we're going to take a look at spoos right now on this chart, right?"
"1162850","1166810"," And I want to direct your attention somewhere specifically."
"1167590","1172730"," So you can see right here, maybe I'll make this larger for you. "
"1173430","1175930"," So take a look on market breadth right here."
"1176190","1185250"," We're at 13.9. When we, depending on who you're talking to, when breadth hits 30, you have risk of"
"1185250","1187890"," a liquidation event in the market."
"1188230","1194430"," As soon as you hit 21, 22, which was earlier in the week, I believe that was on Monday or"
"1194430","1197510"," Tuesday, we hit 18 or 19 or something like that. "
"1198230","1204190"," And I called Joe donut up and I was like, I texted her a column and I go, I was"
"1204190","1206970"," like, we're at 21, I think."
"1207550","1210530"," And I was like, we're going to trigger a liquidation."
"1210690","1211870"," Garin fucking teed. "
"1212750","1219930"," And we did trigger that liquidation down to 13.9. Now the question is, does 13.9 the bottom?"
"1220350","1223410"," I've seen liquidations go as far as six or seven."
"1224550","1226390"," So do I think we're done here?"
"1226990","1229430"," It looks like a bottom in terms of the market breadth."
"1230110","1231170"," It looks like it's a bottom. "
"1231610","1235490"," We have a little bit more to go, but what is the expectation to?"
"1235490","1240930"," We're going to talk about that once we get to the collar and the Q4 kind of stuff."
"1241670","1247690"," And there's one other thing to be looking at here and that is the zero line for PPO and PMO."
"1248330","1252830"," So we've got PMO breaking down below negative here. "
"1253310","1258590"," We still have these orange bar, these purple bars down here are indicating that we're still"
"1258590","1259310"," bearish."
"1260050","1265310"," Okay, and then this PPO above here, we still have white under orange."
"1265890","1268290"," There's been no crossover yet for bulls. "
"1268910","1270750"," So are we done down here?"
"1270830","1273290"," Becomes a question and I don't know that that is the case."
"1273790","1276110"," There could be more down to come."
"1276830","1281530"," Next thing we're going to, so we got PPO PMO saying, it's still not bullish yet. "
"1281970","1285430"," We've got market breadth saying, yeah, we're close."
"1285430","1288610"," 13.9 is like horseshoes and hand grenades."
"1288610","1292710"," Pretty close, but still not. "
"1293250","1296310"," Let me get rid of some of these."
"1299170","1300650"," Still not exactly."
"1301930","1303570"," Hold on a second here. "
"1303710","1305310"," Close some of this stuff for you guys."
"1305650","1308010"," Still not exactly where it should be."
"1309270","1313330"," Still not still not answering what it should be. "
"1313330","1315650"," Now we're going to now take a look at SPX."
"1317670","1319630"," Let me get us to be in a daily chart here."
"1320530","1321670"," No, that's SP. "
"1331230","1331710"," Perfect."
"1333670","1335410"," So here's SPX right here."
"1335510","1337390"," I want to talk to you about the collar. "
"1337850","1338070"," Okay."
"1338730","1344610"," I want to show you guys, if you were to do one."
"1344610","1351490"," You're going to do one, two, three, and four, right?"
"1352210","1356030"," And then you've got one, two. "
"1357130","1358630"," Let's do that better."
"1360350","1363210"," Three and four right here, right?"
"1364450","1370590"," So you can see here where when we came into two, right?"
"1370830","1372150"," You see two and three right there."
"1373010","1374570"," Let's see right there. "
"1375050","1376590"," That dip got bought, right?"
"1376810","1378890"," Double-bottomed, started cranking higher."
"1379330","1380550"," And this is a quarter right here."
"1380670","1384930"," This is your Q2 right here. "
"1385470","1388950"," In your Q2, we continued higher, started blasting up, right?"
"1389370","1393530"," Tagging the upper extremity of the JPM collar, right?"
"1394370","1396150"," Yahoo, everything is awesome, right?"
"1396490","1398110"," Just cranking into that JPM collar."
"1398730","1401410"," I want you to pay attention to this one down here."
"1401410","1402090"," There's two, three. "
"1402810","1407890"," And then I want you to pay attention to this one right here, right?"
"1408710","1412550"," And I want you to see that we didn't get that double-bottomed here, did we?"
"1412890","1420470"," We didn't get that second dip buy right there for that continuation up into end of Q3, right?"
"1420710","1422610"," So if you've got an expectation, I have an expectation."
"1423050","1427950"," I was like, hey, if they buy that daily trigger, the plan is still on for upside."
"1427950","1431270"," So that's the first thing I want you to pay attention to right there. "
"1431750","1433150"," That did not happen, right?"
"1433490","1434430"," We did not get that."
"1434570","1438930"," We got selling on that Thursday on Tuesday of last week."
"1439050","1442110"," And we started raining down into this week right here, right?"
"1443030","1449590"," So it begs the question, it begs the question into the end of third quarter. "
"1450030","1453650"," Hey, can we trade that 46, 65 on SPX?"
"1454230","1456830"," And, you know, that's a long way to go, man."
"1456830","1459370"," And we don't even have a month and a half, we get a month and what?"
"1459630","1465050"," Ten sessions or something, eight sessions, maybe, to get up here and tag that upper extreme."
"1465590","1475350"," Another issue that's happening right now is that the JPM 929 long puts at 42.10 become this"
"1475350","1479390"," kind of a tractor beam, kind of a tractor beam. "
"1479690","1481830"," They will repel as well, right?"
"1481830","1485810"," As we get closer, they'll want to bounce and fail to hit that exact target."
"1486450","1492150"," But then it'll sometimes bounce around down in here into the end of quarter."
"1492450","1493570"," So there's some concern here. "
"1494070","1494610"," There's concern."
"1495070","1496350"," We just looked at breath."
"1496710","1502070"," We just looked at PPO PMOs and mark. "
"1502250","1503050"," We looked at market breath."
"1503090","1508230"," We looked at PPOs PMOs and then we looked at the velocity in the market and it's kind of saying,"
"1508410","1509550"," yeah, even if we come up here."
"1509550","1512930"," Does that mean, you know, is that kind of like, yeah, we're going to trade down here. "
"1513250","1516170"," We're going to have some kind of a failure, maybe up here, right?"
"1516250","1516910"," We trade up here."
"1517150","1521830"," We start trading this zone into end of quarter in here, right?"
"1522750","1528970"," Even if we were to come up into end of quarter, right, and close the gap on high here, it"
"1528970","1536090"," still begs the question into that quarter if we have that magnet on down here into quarter."
"1536090","1541110"," If that is the case, if that is the case where, hey, we're not going back to making a new"
"1541110","1541310"," high. "
"1541490","1546470"," And of course, like if we're not up here, trading this stuff in end of quarter up here, right?"
"1546650","1553050"," You can kind of kiss off that 48 target for December 31st, right?"
"1553190","1555090"," You're not even like you can just kiss that away."
"1555170","1559650"," You can kiss that away and you have to start to as a bull think to yourself."
"1559650","1564230"," Maybe, maybe we'll be lucky if we fail this right here. "
"1564810","1570630"," And then start to think about, yeah, you know, this end of year, something like that."
"1571510","1578770"," Now you start to start to question if all of these targets come down even more."
"1579130","1584510"," And the real scary part here is the real scary part here is heading into the"
"1584510","1590290"," real scary part here, sorry. "
"1592710","1595910"," Real scary part here is if you have the bullish thesis, right?"
"1596710","1597830"," Give the bull thesis."
"1599490","1605030"," And you come up in the end of this court and you trade this 466.5 on SPX, right?"
"1605790","1607010"," Hit and hold this, right?"
"1607770","1613090"," Yeah, we get that fall weakness and then we blast up there for first of the year, right?"
"1613230","1616710"," And you're like, yeah, this is all bullish, bullish, bullish, bull case intact."
"1616710","1622110"," Blast down for the winter months, maybe in April, have another low. "
"1622650","1624210"," And then we're off and running, right?"
"1624890","1628610"," Now, if you don't get this stuff here, does the bull case stay valid?"
"1628990","1630130"," Fuck, no, it doesn't."
"1630550","1631810"," You can't come back up."
"1631810","1632890"," You can't come up here. "
"1633670","1641250"," Like, like smash to the smash to try to attempt to trade the previous highs and fail to do it."
"1641250","1646770"," If you come in to the end of this year and even fail to get a new high on from"
"1646770","1652150"," 2021, it's going to be viewed and looked at as a weak market, right?"
"1652290","1655530"," It's going to be viewed as, hey, that's that we didn't even get a new high."
"1656370","1665170"," And instead of looking down towards 4,200 or 4,000 or 38, maybe we're looking at a retest of"
"1665170","1670470"," the lows of 2022, that 3450 or possibly even lower. "
"1670990","1680070"," You know, the moves like this, looking at stuff like this, being subdued can have an impact on the"
"1680070","1684730"," greater thesis for bulls and for the market at large."
"1685210","1686590"," You're not going to, you're a bull."
"1686850","1690350"," You need to go into the end of this quarter and be like, yeah, we failed. "
"1691410","1693110"," We failed the previous side."
"1693290","1694650"," No big deal up here, right?"
"1694650","1699650"," And we're going to get the new high, though, into December 1st."
"1700850","1707030"," We like you have to like have to hit those metrics can't be breaking down like we did over here. "
"1707090","1714530"," It starts if I'm assuming at this point that bulls out there are saying, yeah, I don't know, even"
"1714530","1714930"," myself."
"1716450","1718650"," I'm questioning, yeah, do I even buy?"
"1719270","1725750"," Do I roll into this dip down here for a move higher into end of quarter?"
"1727130","1728390"," Do I do that, right?"
"1728630","1734790"," Or do I wait maybe for some more damage coming in the spring in the late winter time to buy"
"1734790","1735210"," the market?"
"1735430","1739990"," Like put that kind of risk on like big money, big six figures into this."
"1740390","1743010"," I'm going, I'm having question marks right now on it. "
"1744210","1745670"," Real question marks."
"1745990","1752770"," And to further that point, if we do go up and make that high up here for the JPM caller,"
"1753050","1754810"," I'd be like, yeah, that feels kind of good."
"1755350","1763010"," I like that there, even if this comes back down, then I would consider maybe February or something. "
"1763730","1767650"," But at this point, I'm starting to have some questions here on the bull thesis."
"1768850","1775790"," If they can actually get this done by end of quarter, if they can actually bring this up here for"
"1775790","1776370"," end of quarter."
"1777510","1786470"," If they can actually bring this one up here to end of year and get that, tag that 4800 into"
"1786470","1787030"," end of year. "
"1787190","1789890"," It starts to call out a question, this kind of stuff over here, right?"
"1790090","1790610"," Do you get this?"
"1790830","1791310"," Do you get that?"
"1791750","1792950"," Bull's got to get this stuff."
"1792950","1793970"," They don't have a choice, right?"
"1794310","1798690"," Like you're not going to like roll into February and say, yeah, we're going to have it down"
"1798690","1800770"," February to roll this market over."
"1800970","1807250"," And you might see like 42 or 38 or something like that with this move right here. "
"1807250","1811650"," So this definitely working against the bulls right now."
"1812830","1822610"," Velocity working against the bulls right now."
"1822610","1824530"," Is an oversold bounce. "
"1825470","1831250"," We have the market breath indicator saying, yeah, we're at 13.6. We could get out of six or seven"
"1831250","1832070"," or something like that."
"1832130","1835930"," We know there's a liquidation event that takes place and we get under 21."
"1836710","1838610"," And are we done going down here?"
"1838790","1839590"," Possibly not. "
"1840390","1843390"," And even if we do get that bounce, is it real?"
"1844190","1846790"," And PPL PMO saying no."
"1847350","1848850"," Velocity saying no."
"1849570","1851850"," The only thing saying yes right now. "
"1851890","1855830"," And even the JPM caller is like, hey, man, come on down and see 420."
"1856610","1859930"," So the question becomes, is this going to be a real bounce?"
"1860230","1860910"," Is it sustainable?"
"1861490","1863030"," How high does it go?"
"1864950","1865550"," Hey, buddy."
"1865710","1866690"," What's going on?"
"1867510","1868410"," How's everybody doing?"
"1869510","1871110"," I haven't seen news by Evergrand. "
"1871970","1873850"," Hey, what's going on?"
"1877090","1883610"," We have a ton of, we have a ton of, because in a month, well, because in a month, we've"
"1883610","1887290"," got a bunch of, I don't know if it's mixed fuckery, but it's just, we're short gamma."
"1887290","1889210"," I think the market's short gamma."
"1889470","1892570"," So could be wrong on that, but I think that they are. "
"1894110","1896030"," Let's go back to this one minute chart here."
"1899130","1900470"," Bring that over for you."
"1902550","1905910"," So we're going to take a look at, we're going to take a look at, excuse me. "
"1907190","1908950"," We're going to take a, excuse me."
"1909190","1914590"," We're going to take a look at spy right now on a 15 minute chart here."
"1915810","1916890"," Hold on one second here. "
"1918190","1918990"," All that."
"1930110","1931410"," There's the big purple up top."
"1932190","1938050"," So the price target down below right now for this week, right?"
"1938210","1944530"," If they could get it done today, the price target for today is 42610. "
"1945250","1949470"," Okay, so that was the price target for this week for the weekly trigger down below here."
"1950770","1953870"," Give me one quick second here."
"1953870","1963610"," And if they don't get that trigger this week, it's going to be 432 into"
"1963610","1964330"," next week. "
"1964590","1966990"," So, oh, 428 to 432, I believe."
"1968210","1970090"," That's 428 for next week."
"1971270","1972610"," One quick second here. "
"1978220","1979620"," There's the target for today."
"1981740","1983340"," There's the target for next week."
"1988010","1989450"," 445 14. "
"2001770","2005010"," This is the major point of rejection to the upside."
"2006210","2006730"," 443."
"2008170","2008690"," I got this right. "
"2010190","2012210"," 445 30 right here."
"2012790","2017770"," So this would be where, where bears want rejection on any kind."
"2021960","2026520"," Oh, yeah, we got an oversold bounce rejection tree rejection trade. "
"2030020","2033420"," These are where the bears are where the sellers are right up in here."
"2033420","2034480"," Did I spell that wrong?"
"2034780","2035580"," I'm going to spell that wrong."
"2037240","2038240"," This is the rejection. "
"2038560","2039540"," I think I spoke that wrong."
"2042820","2044300"," Oh, hello, a second here."
"2045160","2045980"," We'll get rid of that. "
"2046240","2047360"," We're going to leave it right now."
"2047639","2052360"," So the rejection trade above is at 445 13 right now."
"2052360","2058120"," We also are coming into some resistance currently on the half hour at 435 88. "
"2058900","2061080"," So right here, there's going to be rejection."
"2062699","2064420"," Right where we are right now."
"2066960","2068480"," Make that one gray. "
"2075330","2078750"," It's the one we've been selling off, by the way, the entire way down."
"2081290","2087960"," And there's another one right here."
"2093739","2095460"," We'll bring this up for you. "
"2100440","2104820"," This is this green and gray bar is where we've been selling off again."
"2104960","2108760"," Every reversal has happened right in here to the downside."
"2115590","2118630"," So projections here are like this. "
"2118630","2122410"," If you're buying a dip on this on this morning, right?"
"2122570","2127170"," If you're buying a dip down here, let me get back over here to a five minute."
"2127690","2132430"," So just in here, this is a place for you to take profit, right?"
"2133790","2139250"," And you're going to be looking if you're if you're a bull, you're going to be looking for the algos"
"2139250","2140130"," to send you higher."
"2141210","2146330"," A confirmation trade, and then you can long this up to 445. "
"2148430","2149290"," So here."
"2152210","2157130"," To 445 13 right up in this zone right here."
"2157810","2161190"," So if you have a question about, Hey, are we done going down?"
"2161390","2166430"," Cap is the correction over the only way that the correction goes over. "
"2166430","2167110"," I'm going to show you."
"2167250","2171790"," I'm going to switch over right now and show you how you know if the correction is over."
"2172210","2175470"," Hey, cap is the correction over is the is the question, right?"
"2175930","2178230"," So we're going to go over to this screen right here. "
"2179110","2180850"," Are we actually going to tag that cap?"
"2181010","2181210"," Yes."
"2181310","2183770"," No, I want to know what's the what's the what's the answer?"
"2183910","2185370"," I'm going to draw it out for you."
"2185470","2190110"," I want you to snip this screen and keep it for yourself and then come back and ask me next"
"2190110","2191350"," week during live stream. "
"2196210","2201950"," So I'm going to show you how you know if correction is over in a second."
"2202270","2207710"," I like seeing that hold up there."
"2208910","2210850"," There's that yellow line right there. "
"2212770","2221630"," This one's going to turn around and make that a little bit darker"
"2221630","2223050"," right there."
"2223950","2226250"," And you would need to see price break above."
"2228150","2228630"," Right. "
"2229250","2230390"," Hold this 437."
"2231770","2232250"," Right."
"2232370","2235010"," Remember the confirmation on the on the hourly is key. "
"2235770","2236250"," Right."
"2236430","2239030"," If it starts to make its way higher, you can enter that trade."
"2240190","2242750"," Take this trade above right to 443. "
"2243810","2245590"," You would exit your long."
"2246390","2250430"," Even if we break higher, you could possibly take that trade on its own."
"2250830","2252250"," Take the money and run in here. "
"2253110","2256970"," But then you're looking for some kind of a consolidation and a move higher."
"2257510","2262510"," This is only time we know that correction is over right in here."
"2263190","2270250"," If price gets above the daily trigger, the hourly trigger and confirms the move higher correction"
"2270250","2271070"," is over. "
"2271830","2275810"," So 443, 445 is going to be a major zone."
"2276350","2276470"," Right."
"2276730","2280570"," So we're going to come back over here real quick and we're going to look at the. "
"2281050","2282290"," We will full chart."
"2282930","2285070"," And so what would be the implication here?"
"2285270","2286510"," So this is coming into next week."
"2286770","2286830"," Right. "
"2288310","2292530"," If you're like Super Bowl and you're like a cap corrections over, we're going to go up there and"
"2292530","2293310"," we're going to do our thing."
"2294050","2294990"," No big deal."
"2294990","2295370"," Right. "
"2295590","2297010"," You're going to be looking at some points."
"2298170","2298630"," Right."
"2298630","2300270"," For price to get above. "
"2301450","2302370"," The daily trigger."
"2302370","2302830"," Right."
"2303010","2306870"," And then begin to bounce and start to head higher. "
"2307910","2313730"," And you're going to be looking for this hourly trigger to come up and tell that same story, right."
"2314210","2317450"," You'll have the four trigger cluster and correction is over."
"2317970","2321950"," Wipe the tears, wipe the sweat off your face, whatever, whatever it is for you. "
"2321990","2323650"," If it was good for you, if it was bad for you."
"2324190","2326470"," If you're a bull and you're like, yeah, I just want it to go up."
"2326490","2331910"," If you're a bear out there and you want to feel like a cap, I don't think the correction is"
"2331910","2332230"," over. "
"2332370","2332730"," I'm with you."
"2332730","2333750"," We're going to keep going down."
"2334630","2336850"," You are also looking for this. "
"2337150","2337790"," You don't want."
"2337950","2342510"," You want to, if we get up here and you start to see the bounce and it starts to go"
"2342510","2346790"," higher, you know exactly where to put your stops in, right."
"2346930","2348630"," They're above this 450 mark. "
"2349650","2349790"," Right."
"2350310","2353990"," And you will be entering shorts again up here."
"2354110","2361210"," It's 450, 445, 443, 445 in here, 443 somewhere in this vicinity. "
"2361210","2364290"," So you can begin to take this back down again."
"2364750","2371150"," Another note for you, if you're a bear, is you don't want to see the hourly break above the daily"
"2371150","2371410"," trigger."
"2371410","2373170"," You prefer to see it stay down here. "
"2373770","2376630"," Watch the bulls come up here and squeeze this higher, right."
"2377090","2377330"," Oversold."
"2377430","2377730"," Yahoo. "
"2378270","2378890"," Bull's doing it."
"2379730","2380590"," Hourly doesn't follow."
"2381030","2387210"," Comes back down and boom gets stuck underneath and we start selling down, down, down once again. "
"2387210","2390530"," Take some snapshots of this right here."
"2391610","2394670"," The extremity to the downside for this week for today is 426."
"2395470","2400810"," If there is a failure here in the close, be looking for that 426 down here into this bell. "
"2401130","2405930"," If they can't get it this week, I'm going to be looking for a failure to get down here into"
"2405930","2409310"," the end by end of Friday of next week."
"2409550","2411490"," So this is what you need to know if you're a bull."
"2411910","2415470"," You need to get above 443, 445, defend it. "
"2415470","2418070"," It's not good enough to squeeze above it, right."
"2418270","2418890"," We already know that."
"2419090","2419810"," Can't squeeze above. "
"2420330","2421690"," Start breaking down again."
"2421910","2426850"," You have to confirm that you're going higher to put risk on in this market."
"2427130","2435150"," So bulls, even if this is a bottom, even if this is the bottom, you have no trade. "
"2436150","2444170"," That's confidence in this market until you retake 445 and begin to trade higher."
"2444170","2450330"," 443, 445, someone here and start confirming it and then start heading higher like nothing ever"
"2450330","2450670"," happened."
"2451270","2452390"," You need that. "
"2452810","2461170"," Now saying that, bulls, if you do start to trade higher than this 443 and it's like nothing ever"
"2461170","2464450"," happened, I'm going to question for you."
"2464450","2466090"," You don't have a lot of time."
"2466690","2469670"," I'm going to tell you that this whole purple zone up here, right. "
"2469670","2474550"," These sellers are going to attempt to come in and sell you down."
"2475010","2477750"," For 62, 46, 460."
"2478030","2480270"," They do not want you getting up here. "
"2480690","2484990"," You need a catalyst to begin to trade above up here."
"2485170","2487450"," So we already know there's major sellers here."
"2487590","2493750"," The first band of major sellers, you have three bands of major sellers above you. "
"2493970","2495050"," The first band we failed."
"2496070","2497930"," And now you've got to retake that band."
"2497930","2501590"," Get rid of those sellers and hit the second band above. "
"2502570","2503730"," Right now for bulls."
"2505070","2512430"," I'm telling you, if you're a bull out there, right, the thesis of 480 by end of year, it's done"
"2512430","2514390"," really shaky ground."
"2514730","2523050"," And if that starts to bleed into this market, right, if that starts to bleed into sentiment, I'm"
"2523050","2526550"," going to tell you right now, right. "
"2530410","2533930"," I was like, I was like, I was like, man, I was like, I just had an alert that I"
"2533930","2536810"," have not had just popped up."
"2536810","2539790"," It's like, what are my alerts for the triggers said sell it all."
"2540870","2544330"," Sell everything and start hedging the market. "
"2544650","2552330"," So when that when that alert was sent to me, I'm going to assume here that I'm going to assume"
"2552330","2559190"," that, like putting that major money into the market, like right here."
"2562930","2566130"," Questionable for what does it produce, right?"
"2566430","2570910"," Does it go up to 470, 480, threat 435?"
"2572030","2574830"," Is there time at 432, 428?"
"2575350","2576630"," Is there actually time to get to 480?"
"2577470","2578210"," By end of year?"
"2578910","2580390"," That's a tough call, man."
"2580910","2581930"," Tough, tough call. "
"2582250","2586690"," If we had bounced on that daily trigger, I'd say, fuck yeah, we're going to keep going higher."
"2587410","2591570"," Right here, right now, it's getting questionable."
"2592230","2596170"," It looks like we're going to trade 420-ish. "
"2596450","2597610"," I don't think we actually tag it."
"2597990","2606170"," Might factor beam to it, but 420-ish to that 430, 445 somewhere in there."
"2606170","2611210"," And then we start legging down into first of the year, February, something like that. "
"2611690","2613570"," Now, for that thesis to change, right?"
"2613650","2615730"," For us to be like, yeah, we're going to go to that 480-year."
"2617130","2618730"," There's the big bad boy right there."
"2620110","2622710"," This is the big bad boy right here that needs to be overcome. "
"2623070","2626350"," So now if you're a bull and you're like, hey, we got up here at Cap."
"2626770","2627270"," You were wrong."
"2627390","2628290"," We're going higher here. "
"2629730","2630090"," Truly."
"2630790","2631250"," Truly."
"2632650","2639330"," Before end of this quarter, you must be above $4.59.92, like hanging tough. "
"2640190","2648630"," Like old school and as an NK YTV or something like that, new kids on the block NK OTB for"
"2648630","2648850"," bull."
"2649030","2652470"," So just anywhere you guys know, already know, but all is purple up here."
"2652510","2655490"," You know what this represents and you know what's above it. "
"2655490","2660110"," The next target up here is this 466, 469, 470."
"2660890","2662250"," This is end of quarter right here."
"2662370","2663790"," You want to tag that by end of quarter. "
"2664810","2665330"," Roll this thing."
"2665510","2668850"," Roll this bad boy over after end of quarter or near end of quarter."
"2669210","2676210"," If you're a bull and then attempt to buy a dip down below to attack that 4800, that new all "
"2676210","2680270","-time high for end of year to have a better look for 2024. "
"2688890","2690410"," U.S. economy is strong."
"2690590","2692450"," You're saying the catalyst is not strong enough."
"2692750","2697810"," I think it comes down to, I think it comes down to, I see that question. "
"2698490","2700010"," Let's go back to SPX really quick."
"2701270","2702290"," Well, SPX."
"2703010","2706310"," So I think the question comes back to right here. "
"2707850","2710950"," For that bull thesis for 2024, right?"
"2712910","2715050"," You really do the thesis."
"2715470","2717130"," You can see it right here, right?"
"2717230","2719530"," I want you to draw your attention back here, right?"
"2720110","2720950"," You have the failure."
"2721190","2721910"," Let me show you this here. "
"2722670","2725090"," I'm trying to explain this better to you."
"2726690","2729510"," So I want you to see this original failure right here."
"2729570","2731030"," I'll tag this one right here, right?"
"2731250","2732030"," You got the first failure. "
"2733330","2733890"," Hold on a second here."
"2735750","2736530"," That's not working."
"2737730","2742490"," I want you to draw your attention right here, okay?"
"2742490","2745730"," I want you to see this right here. "
"2745870","2748490"," You expect failure up here, right?"
"2749290","2750210"," So right there, right?"
"2750510","2752350"," You expect failure right there, right?"
"2752570","2754470"," We talked about this before it failed."
"2755090","2759910"," I had done a video with you and said, yeah, you're going to expect, you know, we're kind of topping"
"2759910","2760730"," in here, right?"
"2761710","2764750"," Now you're going to expect sellers to naturally come in here."
"2764770","2768910"," You're going to expect the Michael Barries to come out and say, you're going to expect these big"
"2768910","2771550"," guys like Michael Barries come out and they're going to tell you I'm short. "
"2771550","2773670"," They're going to tell you I'm short here."
"2773910","2776030"," They're going to tell you that they're short, short here."
"2776430","2778950"," So that they're not looking like they're broken clock, right?"
"2779190","2783810"," They want to come out at specific times and say, I'm short because they know that we're coming into"
"2783810","2786030"," these three places, right?"
"2786230","2787610"," We sold right here, right?"
"2787990","2793470"," But you're expecting this to hold to then attack the second one right here, right?"
"2794450","2797410"," Hold that, tag that one, take out all these sellers. "
"2797410","2805490"," And then for the end of year, way over there, you're expecting that last little rip higher, right?"
"2805730","2807910"," All time high end of 2023."
"2808390","2813810"," Everybody's just pumping and they bang the market really low for end of winter."
"2814010","2817750"," But you have made these, you've broken through these sellers back here. "
"2817970","2820270"," You can't like roll off this."
"2820290","2825170"," These things did not recover for the next bunch because that shows you the will of buyers."
"2825910","2828930"," Will of buyers right now is looking pretty sketchy, right?"
"2829310","2834010"," Like we came up here and the buyers are like, no, we suck, right?"
"2834910","2835310"," We suck. "
"2835530","2837790"," We're going way lower down here."
"2837910","2838250"," You see it?"
"2839050","2845210"," So you're kind of at that place where, I'm telling you, we're kind of at that place where you start"
"2845210","2848150"," to wonder if you can actually get that high at this point."
"2849310","2851290"," So big key indicator here. "
"2851290","2860030"," If you're a bull, big key indicators here is bringing question into the will of bulls."
"2860330","2861950"," Can they actually get up here?"
"2862090","2863810"," Can they then attack the second one?"
"2864190","2867510"," Is this second one still viable at this point?"
"2870930","2871610"," What do you say?"
"2871730","2872490"," I want to be diamond hands."
"2872670","2874910"," I think I just answered one of the diamond hands question. "
"2875190","2878730"," I saw his question there just a moment ago."
"2879250","2882110"," So it does bring in to question, can we go higher?"
"2882110","2886390"," So the last thing I would say here would be do you get above, right?"
"2886510","2888270"," We talked about that 445, 443."
"2888790","2893090"," If you start to trade higher, I'll entertain that move above, right?"
"2893570","2900230"," But otherwise, if we close this gap and those three sellers come back in for September, October,"
"2900650","2901770"," watch out, right?"
"2902310","2903250"," Totally watch out here. "
"2903870","2909890"," If you're a bull, had we held here, I would have said, yeah, you know, stay in the market a"
"2909890","2910350"," little bit longer."
"2911970","2913510"," But that is not what happened."
"2918110","2919750"," Yeah, good to see all of you out there right now. "
"2920830","2922110"," Good to see all of you out there right now."
"2922330","2924430"," So I think that's all of it here."
"2924670","2928970"," Did you guys, you guys got to see the triggers and all that stuff?"
"2929670","2931610"," I'm going to move some of this down. "
"2931790","2932210"," Hang tight here."
"2934150","2936070"," I got a new setup going on in the background."
"2938350","2939910"," Yeah, let's take a look at Tesla. "
"2940310","2941310"," We'll get Apple right now."
"2941310","2944030"," Well, whatever you guys want me to look at, I've got some time left."
"2944570","2945190"," It's 1136. "
"2945530","2948730"," I got to go in the next, I got to be out here by 12."
"2949150","2952810"," So if any questions, you go slow."
"2952990","2954090"," You guys asked tons of questions. "
"2954210","2957930"," I'll go through as many charts as I can for you."
"2958090","2959570"," So we'll take a look right now at Tesla."
"2961470","2964810"," And we're going to take a look at this over here. "
"2966490","2967250"," Right here."
"2969190","2971250"," So we're going to look at Tesla right now."
"2973490","2976370"," And we have scare here, right?"
"2977190","2978290"," Like freaking out, right?"
"2978510","2979290"," What's going on with Tesla?"
"2980090","2982270"," I'm sure if you're a Tesla bull, you're freaking out. "
"2982350","2983790"," You're like, oh, it's all bad."
"2983990","2984930"," It's our terrible cap."
"2985710","2986730"," Doom and gloom for Tesla. "
"2987330","2988250"," That kind of stuff, right?"
"2989670","2993570"," You see Tesla breaking its weekly and it's monthly, right?"
"2993570","2999310"," You also see it's weekly for the first time beginning to turn down right here."
"2999350","3000650"," I want you to see this here."
"3001290","3006210"," Weekly beginning to turn down, not bullish in any way, shape, or form. "
"3006990","3009790"," Tesla trading 213 right now, right?"
"3009990","3016010"," There was no dip buy on this 232, 223, whatever that was, 226."
"3017010","3018410"," There was no dip buy down there."
"3018570","3022810"," I bet the question becomes, hey, is this the time to buy the dip cap?"
"3023290","3026510"," And I took a look at Tesla last night and I was like, you know what?"
"3027410","3030610"," I was like, I'm looking at the general market here and it looks like it wants to go a little"
"3030610","3031030"," bit lower. "
"3031930","3034850"," And I look at this initial rundown here, right?"
"3035630","3037550"," So this initial rundown here is what?"
"3038210","3038530"," 170ish."
"3039490","3040750"," So this initial run."
"3040850","3042770"," Remember jumping in on this run to go higher?"
"3043670","3044790"," And I'm like, I betcha. "
"3045570","3048930"," I betcha we can easily take all of that out now, right?"
"3049290","3051350"," I betcha the will of all of these people is gone."
"3051350","3056110"," And if anything, they're going to be looking to buy a dip even lower."
"3056570","3065810"," So for Tesla, what you need to know about Tesla right now, okay, is that there is no buy on"
"3065810","3066130"," Tesla. "
"3066430","3066870"," There is none."
"3067210","3069090"," Zero buy on Tesla."
"3071170","3078090"," I started down below at least 200, if not 184, 85, somewhere in there. "
"3078090","3081130"," Can that change for Tesla?"
"3081650","3082610"," Yes, it can."
"3083610","3087550"," But I'm going to show you what it needs to do to get bullish together and you're not going to"
"3087550","3087950"," like it."
"3088650","3093230"," It's going to be like, I'm not taking this trade here, right?"
"3094230","3096010"," Like you've got no trade right there. "
"3096650","3099170"," You actually need this to come down."
"3099590","3101270"," Like you've got work to do."
"3101470","3106010"," You have like, you need this to come down right here, right?"
"3106890","3109730"," You need price to come above. "
"3110270","3111870"," Let's get some of this going here."
"3113250","3118270"," You need price to squeeze higher, right, or even fail right here, right?"
"3118570","3119730"," Come back down right here."
"3119830","3122550"," And then you need the hourly trigger to come back up. "
"3122770","3127470"," You have a lot of work in here to do to start getting bullish on Tesla."
"3128070","3128770"," I'm going to warn you this."
"3128970","3132510"," Like Tesla, you got work and you don't want to be a part of this. "
"3132590","3135850"," Maybe you want to day trade this, but I wouldn't want to be a part of it."
"3135850","3138430"," At any moment, you get sent lower here."
"3138850","3139550"," No problemo. "
"3139750","3141350"," Any moment sent lower here."
"3141970","3143750"," No problemo, right?"
"3144030","3146450"," And you're like, out of shit's luck over here, right?"
"3147150","3150990"," So there really isn't like a, yeah, is there a bullish thesis on Tesla right now?"
"3151290","3151970"," There is not."
"3152550","3155630"," There's no bullish thesis on Tesla as of right now. "
"3155870","3161830"," And there's so much work that needs to happen to begin to get bullish on Tesla again."
"3162710","3163510"," And for that upside move."
"3163510","3164590"," Now, I'll tell you what. "
"3165730","3170770"," I'm going to warn it when you get the warning, like right down there is now the target."
"3171690","3174330"," This whole group of people that are down here, right?"
"3174990","3175730"," Way down there."
"3176050","3177830"," They're probably like, yeah, I'm out, right?"
"3177970","3183090"," The people like me, dude, like you're out and start breaking down these levels right here. "
"3183710","3183930"," Whoop."
"3184870","3185350"," Right."
"3185650","3189790"," You're going to end up, you're going to end up being the last guy over here holding these bags from"
"3189790","3191270"," people that were buying down here. "
"3191270","3193390"," We were buying down here, right?"
"3193690","3195350"," Remember we're buying down here to go higher?"
"3195890","3197610"," That's where real demand is."
"3197910","3199890"," And let me show you where that real demand truly is."
"3200730","3203030"," It's actually way down here. "
"3203830","3204350"," 153."
"3205690","3207930"," That's true demand for Tesla right now."
"3208150","3209390"," Trade to 1269. "
"3210210","3212790"," Real demand, way down here."
"3213630","3218550"," That means you're going to start to consider it up here."
"3218550","3222070"," Like begin to consider. "
"3222290","3223250"," Do we catch a bounce?"
"3223450","3226150"," Does it bounce back up and consolidate, right?"
"3226330","3227090"," Does it bounce here?"
"3227390","3228550"," Does it come back up and consolidate?"
"3229370","3230150"," Does it bounce here?"
"3230530","3231450"," It starts to consolidate."
"3231850","3234050"," Do you start to see the daily come underneath, right?"
"3234670","3235430"," They're underneath the weekly."
"3235770","3238230"," Can we at least get some confidence that we're going higher here?"
"3238650","3239850"," None of that has happened on Tesla. "
"3240150","3240770"," None of that."
"3241650","3242890"," There is no dip."
"3243110","3247190"," Like something you could day trade and stuff, but there's no like, yeah, I'm going to throw fucking"
"3247190","3249290"," $350,000 on Tesla right now. "
"3249630","3250330"," Fuck no."
"3250830","3253430"," There is no dip by here for you as a Tesla buyer."
"3253950","3255210"," So Tesla downside target. "
"3256330","3259990"," The ugly, 150, 152."
"3261590","3269750"," You need to also, if you're a Tesla trader, you need to be able to identify, is this an oversold"
"3269750","3271270"," market bounce."
"3271270","3275510"," So I went over this briefly earlier where I showed you pay rent. "
"3275830","3278430"," I think it was 13% on market breadth indicator."
"3279090","3286690"," You get an oversold bounce at about 13% or 7% and that oversold bounce sends us up here,"
"3286750","3287210"," let's say."
"3287730","3291970"," And the daily trigger is still coming down on you and it just starts to send you lower here. "
"3293890","3296050"," You know, you have to be aware of that."
"3296170","3297570"," I need you to be aware."
"3297570","3305570"," If we turn into a negative regime, if the market turns negative, if we turn into 2021 again, or"
"3305570","3309930"," 2022, if the market turns into that, you are going to see. "
"3311310","3314790"," You are, you will see selling off that daily trigger."
"3315290","3317070"," This is where the cells will come from."
"3319310","3321650"," And they'll just be oversold bounces to buy. "
"3321870","3322370"," That'll be it."
"3322610","3324570"," So be very careful."
"3326050","3329070"," This, this breaking underneath the weekly here. "
"3330390","3331730"," Turning down over here."
"3331930","3337630"," If we close this month, negative, this blue line right here begins to close negative on the month"
"3337630","3338830"," and turning down with the weekly."
"3339810","3341370"," I'd be, I'd be sketchy. "
"3341610","3344070"," I'd be like, yeah, you know, September."
"3344790","3346070"," Yeah, maybe not so good."
"3346670","3346910"," Right. "
"3347170","3352390"," So we don't want to see where Tesla closes in the month of August."
"3352390","3354990"," And so make a little note for yourself."
"3355510","3362110"," Make a little note for yourself that this month, Tesla must close over to 23. "
"3362890","3364770"," No choice like must."
"3365610","3370990"," If it does not close this month over to 23, I'm going to get pretty bearish."
"3371290","3375410"," I'm going to actually get bearish, but I'll be looking for that in the end of month. "
"3377190","3377690"," Tesla."
"3378170","3379130"," Oh, she got here."
"3379490","3379750"," Thanks. "
"3380170","3380610"," You're welcome."
"3382390","3384470"," Just Tesla for today and next week."
"3384590","3384810"," Okay. "
"3385090","3385870"," We'll do it right now."
"3386030","3386290"," You ready?"
"3387990","3390130"," Just Tesla for today and this week."
"3392030","3392770"," Are you ready?"
"3395130","3396450"," Into the clothes today. "
"3397290","3399930"," I'm going to expect a mass selling."
"3400650","3401570"," You want to know?"
"3402010","3402650"," I'll tell you."
"3403390","3407450"," I'm going to expect some mass selling into the clothes downside target into the bell today. "
"3410010","3412030"," This is going to piss you off, right?"
"3412770","3413710"," Target of day."
"3414070","3415790"," We're at 212-201-34."
"3416450","3418070"," That sounds really sketchy here. "
"3419310","3421170"," Downside target into the clothes today."
"3422430","3423550"," 201-34."
"3424850","3430450"," If you wanted to take a long trade on Tesla today or bring this up for you real quick. "
"3430450","3430730"," Okay."
"3431370","3442150"," If you wanted to take a long trade into Tesla today, you would be buying above $2.16.57. Buying"
"3442150","3445390"," above $2.16.57 and you could possibly trade it to."
"3446270","3447930"," You got no trade today. "
"3448590","3449390"," I'm sorry, man."
"3449710","3452390"," You don't hour or two hours."
"3458630","3459690"," 20 up here. "
"3459870","3460630"," You got nothing."
"3460870","3461450"," I'm telling you."
"3462370","3464110"," You got nothing here, man. "
"3464370","3467770"," All of this here is very, very, very bad for you."
"3467990","3470930"," All of this up here."
"3471090","3472770"," There are sellers up here, man. "
"3473510","3478090"," You got some major resistance here."
"3478830","3479350"," Major."
"3479590","3488590"," This one's going to be down there at some point, but major, major, major resistance right there. "
"3489330","3491150"," Major resistance right here."
"3491550","3493130"," Get out of here."
"3493210","3493870"," We're going to keep selling. "
"3494850","3498090"," Your major resistance above is 224-97, 223-87."
"3498810","3504590"," Then you've got this patch of volume here at 217-60 and 216-57."
"3505610","3508490"," If you're like, hey, Cap, I don't believe you were going up into the bell. "
"3509470","3512610"," This is the path that you'd be looking to take right here."
"3513210","3514370"," You want to know about just today."
"3515730","3518670"," You could take this trade right here. "
"3521150","3524920"," I'm going to make that white for you."
"3527160","3528760"," If you can hold right there."
"3529260","3532660"," This is a Friday, 1500, 63 PM maybe. "
"3533360","3536820"," Maybe you can catch a squeeze up here into the bell."
"3537480","3540280"," You can bounce on 217-60."
"3540820","3543440"," You could possibly catch this up into the close. "
"3544160","3544700"," Hold on a second here."
"3549660","3551540"," Two minute bull view."
"3551980","3552180"," Okay. "
"3552260","3552820"," I got you."
"3553000","3553800"," Hold on a second here."
"3554240","3555580"," I'll give you two minutes for each one. "
"3557680","3559780"," So Tesla, not bullish."
"3560300","3564720"," I'm not bullish and Tesla has a lot of work to do."
"3565160","3572540"," If you want to begin to get bullish on Tesla, price needs to break above 226. "
"3573600","3578640"," Hold 226 and begin to make its way higher right in there."
"3579000","3579960"," Needs to get above this."
"3580920","3582080"," No question about it. "
"3582080","3587360"," If it squeezes up here and you're like the guy in the chat that goes, I knew it was going"
"3587360","3587940"," to go up there."
"3588320","3589000"," I don't care."
"3589120","3590280"," It's not a high probability trade. "
"3590500","3592520"," It's a risky trade to take."
"3593560","3597280"," You're not risky trade is the bounce."
"3598020","3599940"," And then it continues higher. "
"3600640","3603460"," Not the bounce and breaks below none of that shit."
"3603960","3605500"," It has to be above that 220."
"3605920","3613440"," It's 224.97. I said 226, but it's 224.97. So basically 225, you need to be above your bull. "
"3613760","3614740"," That's what you're looking for."
"3616800","3617680"," On Tesla."
"3619940","3620940"," Have a look at Bitcoin. "
"3621320","3622480"," Yes, we should look at Bitcoin."
"3622680","3628820"," If I can, if at the time I will, take a look at Tesla."
"3630620","3631400"," Let's see here. "
"3632340","3635180"," You look at post centroids."
"3635320","3636900"," Are you saying that Tesla looks like dog shit?"
"3637580","3638060"," It does."
"3638540","3639860"," It does not look good, dude. "
"3641800","3643680"," Can you look at GME as a bottom."
"3643960","3644360"," Thanks, Cap."
"3644540","3645860"," Yeah, let's talk about GME. "
"3646840","3647520"," Hold on one second here."
"3648100","3653160"," We'll do GME and then we'll go over and we'll do one more market wrap up so that Binky can"
"3653160","3653920"," post this stuff."
"3655480","3657040"," Oh, look, it's like a GME. "
"3664900","3665640"," GME, baby."
"3667180","3669780"," Is GME able to hold up at $20.46?"
"3670940","3671840"," Fuck no, right?"
"3672180","3673140"," No, it's not, right?"
"3673580","3674560"," You've got daily crut."
"3674620","3677280"," You've got a break below hourly or weekly, excuse me. "
"3677660","3679580"," You've got daily breaking over weekly."
"3679900","3680780"," That's extremely bearish."
"3681800","3683140"," Do you want to know what happens when that happens?"
"3683320","3684000"," I'll show it to you. "
"3684620","3685060"," I want it."
"3685160","3687740"," I want you to see this cross here, right here, right?"
"3687960","3689820"," This was going into earlier last week."
"3690340","3695900"," The moment you saw that break in that cross right there, right, you know it's going down, right,"
"3696440","3697420"," with some force. "
"3697780","3700480"," What happens when this cross happens, right?"
"3700880","3701940"," Do you guys know what happens?"
"3702500","3705880"," Let's take a look and see some previous examples of it."
"3707120","3713240"," When we get those crosses, right, here's a cross right here."
"3713320","3713680"," What happens?"
"3714500","3715580"," There's a cross right there, right?"
"3717580","3719700"," Let's look at a prior example of it. "
"3719700","3721640"," You blast down, right?"
"3722420","3723980"," It starts sitting on this daily."
"3724240","3726000"," I was just talking about this with Tesla, right?"
"3726500","3731380"," It starts riding that daily, and then that weekly comes down and goes, nope, we're crossing the"
"3731380","3735340"," monthly, and we're going to go even lower on GME."
"3735980","3745500"," So if that is the case with GME, if that is the case with GME, you've already broken some"
"3745500","3746900"," support here, right?"
"3746900","3749140"," Right, we got this support right there. "
"3752140","3753160"," It's a 30 minute."
"3759700","3761100"," There's your prior support."
"3761520","3763260"," We're heading down there to retest that. "
"3764360","3772020"," Currently, price target, $15.57. We got down here already with a cross above, right?"
"3772300","3774040"," Got it down here already in a cross below."
"3774040","3777500"," Cross below, slammed it down even lower."
"3777920","3781300"," This time, you're ready for the next target for GME. "
"3781540","3782920"," This is going to piss off GME bulls."
"3783780","3784800"," I know it is."
"3789870","3791830"," Next target, GME bulls. "
"3792190","3796830"," Well, if you want to get bullish on GME, you need to get above 1886."
"3798610","3799670"," You begin to get bullish."
"3800210","3805030"," You have one bar here, which is positive. "
"3805030","3811350"," When you start to see these bars get shorter up here, I'm starting to get bullish on GME."
"3811590","3814210"," So this one bar right here is looking good for GME."
"3815010","3816210"," Saying that though. "
"3818430","3819910"," Saying that though."
"3824340","3825700"," We'll snap this in."
"3825960","3830060"," See right here, consolidation, right?"
"3830880","3831900"," You get trapped in here. "
"3835480","3838380"," Break below, and there's your ultimate target."
"3838380","3848360"," $9.76. I don't want to say that to you as a GME bull, but there's that cross right"
"3848360","3849800"," there, right?"
"3850520","3856780"," You start seeing stuff like this in here, and this actually wouldn't take that long."
"3856940","3859720"," It would take a lot shorter time period. "
"3861600","3864100"," Let me just redraw this."
"3867020","3868460"," Looks better here."
"3874250","3876030"," And then bam, right there. "
"3879970","3881430"," Not looking good here."
"3883010","3884070"," Right down there."
"3885790","3889950"," And even if this even, and this is the last part I'm going to say to you about this, right?"
"3890070","3899590"," If you're a GME bull, and you see price go higher, and it does not break above the daily trigger"
"3899590","3899890"," here. "
"3901070","3903730"," So if you start to see price doing this right here, right?"
"3904030","3906430"," And it's slamming off of the daily trigger."
"3907250","3909110"," Start to see this mellowin' out here."
"3909550","3910850"," You're not a good sign, right?"
"3911210","3913010"," Showing that the bulls don't have the will to get higher. "
"3913870","3917910"," You will then see that drop over there, and then another drop down here for GME."
"3918870","3922130"," So GME, right now, is it bullish?"
"3922130","3922850"," No."
"3923890","3926110"," It needs to be above $20. "
"3926590","3927750"," Has to be above $20."
"3928750","3931110"," And truthfully, it needs to get above $2205."
"3932570","3934310"," Is there a trade today on GME?"
"3934550","3939010"," You might be asking, we're going to go back down to a one minute chart, and just take a quick"
"3939010","3939610"," peek at it. "
"3940350","3943930"," Is there a trade for GME today?"
"3946350","3948830"," So this is a one minute chart on GME."
"3949010","3950130"," Does GME go up today?"
"3950130","3951150"," I'll tell you this."
"3953090","3954730"," See how our squeeze and I are?"
"3954990","3956690"," There's a previous example right there. "
"3957470","3959390"," There's a previous example right there."
"3959750","3962310"," Right, what do we always say when we break above the hourly trigger?"
"3962930","3963610"," It's like a rule."
"3963970","3965030"," It's like a rule, man. "
"3965170","3967250"," Like you keep this as a rule."
"3968510","3969910"," It's okay to trade this up."
"3970030","3970130"," Yahoo!"
"3971430","3972530"," Take the money and run, right?"
"3973590","3974630"," Take the money and run. "
"3975970","3976970"," Let it consolidate."
"3977850","3980530"," Let it get above this previous high right here."
"3980990","3983350"," Jump in on that trade right there, right?"
"3983750","3986290"," That's where you take your next squeeze long right there, right?"
"3986730","3988310"," You ain't fucking around in here, though, right?"
"3988950","3990230"," Same thing right here, right?"
"3991050","3991350"," Boom. "
"3991590","3991650"," Yahoo!"
"3992010","3992690"," Took that as awesome."
"3993510","3994550"," Setting up right now, right?"
"3994890","3997670"," See it's setting up for that next squeeze higher, right?"
"3998370","4000850"," So let's say you take a long right now on GME."
"4001130","4001690"," What are you going to do?"
"4002370","4004110"," You got your stops down here, right?"
"4006250","4007090"," Stops, right?"
"4007690","4009570"," You're long right now on GME. "
"4009890","4012200"," If you want to be long right now, GME, you can be long, right?"
"4013050","4016230"," You're going to look to trade that 1865."
"4017150","4018590"," But truthfully, what are you looking for?"
"4018870","4020550"," You're not looking for any of this crap, are you?"
"4021430","4028610"," You're actually looking for the squeeze higher, the consolidation, and then the continuation higher"
"4028610","4030410"," to be like, hell yeah, man."
"4030550","4033550"," We're going way up and we're going to close out some previous stuff. "
"4033550","4036870"," So GME is a one minute chart in GME."
"4037370","4046510"," If you hold above 1854, your next target to the upside is 1873."
"4047290","4052930"," The next target after that is 1902. "
"4054130","4057530"," Then you've got another target above here, 1927."
"4062700","4065880"," Move this one down right here because that's your next one."
"4065920","4070440"," You've got another one right there and you've got another one right here. "
"4071100","4075100"," Next target of that, 1972, 1972, 2017."
"4075740","4078760"," And then I'm going to expect a major failure right in here."
"4082180","4083940"," Let's just call it 20 bucks. "
"4084900","4086440"," There's 2017 right there."
"4087140","4089080"," I'm going to find it hard to believe that you get 20 bucks."
"4089080","4094000"," $20.72 hard to believe that you get there. "
"4094600","4096439"," I think you might be lucky today."
"4096600","4104359"," If you get above, if you get above, if you get above this 1854, then to close,"
"4105819","4119130"," you'll be"
"4119130","4120149"," lucky to get 1927."
"4120830","4121490"," I'll give you that. "
"4121609","4121950"," How about that?"
"4121950","4122590"," 1927."
"4124390","4126270"," Into the close for today."
"4126510","4126850"," Possible. "
"4127390","4130689"," If you can stay above 1854."
"4131170","4132609"," You do look good on."
"4133870","4134510"," No. "
"4140529","4143750"," You do look good on daily Vellow down here."
"4144069","4145830"," You look okay on."
"4146830","4153010"," You look okay over here on your near zero line and hourly Vellow in truthfulness. "
"4153210","4154870"," You need to hold above it."
"4154870","4159410"," If you want that next push higher, you need to get above."
"4160130","4163370"," You need to get above and hold 1854. "
"4164149","4168750"," You have to get above it, retest it, and get that one in five minute to help you out to"
"4168750","4170410"," get higher today on GME."
"4175819","4176600"," Thank you."
"4178060","4179000"," Sorry about that. "
"4179760","4186300"," I've got kids that are, that kids going back to school and it's a nightmare right now."
"4186740","4190840"," We got like tutors and SATs and private school."
"4192040","4192840"," Private school. "
"4193180","4194400"," Do you want private schools costing?"
"4194980","4195160"," I guess."
"4196080","4198980"," I guess what one student is in private school right now."
"4200020","4202940"," Somebody in the chat, throw out a number what you think it is. "
"4203080","4204720"," I thought I knew what it was and I was wrong."
"4206120","4207400"," It is no joke."
"4208500","4210220"," It is absolutely no joke. "
"4211580","4213400"," It makes me want to throw up even thinking about it."
"4214980","4215840"," Take a guess."
"4218520","4223300"," Yeah, I don't like when it comes to like news, I'm not really a fan of it. "
"4223420","4224740"," I've got to be honest with you."
"4224760","4228140"," I'm not really like someone bought this and someone bought that and Kathy bought this."
"4228460","4229760"," I'm not really a fan of it. "
"4233960","4234880"," Three grand a month."
"4236100","4236540"," Close."
"4237100","4238700"," It's $41,000. "
"4242060","4243020"," $41,000."
"4245620","4246100"," $41."
"4247340","4250600"," Dude, I actually, well, I applied for financial aid. "
"4251820","4254380"," I was like, fucking what?"
"4256340","4258020"," I don't think I'm going to be eligible."
"4258480","4259560"," So I think I have to come up with it."
"4259720","4260500"," I think I got it though. "
"4260860","4265320"," So we got like $41,000 per student."
"4266420","4268740"," So the younger one, I'm like, you're not going to that school."
"4269060","4271100"," You're going to a different private school, cheap private school. "
"4273220","4274920"," But the older ones got two years left."
"4275220","4280420"," So I'm like, yeah, I was like, if you can get into this school and we can afford it."
"4280500","4282120"," You're going to go for your last two years of high school. "
"4284040","4288320"," And then we're doing like a tutor for her to the older one, like the older one."
"4288980","4291760"," She's got a four hours a week with an SAT tutor."
"4292260","4295560"," And she's in a SAT boot camp now for 90 days. "
"4296920","4302440"," And she's got two of those lined up one for junior year and one for senior year."
"4303760","4307400"," To get like, trying to get her like a 15 or 1600 on her SATs."
"4308160","4309280"," Not going to be easy. "
"4310580","4312520"," No, I think that you know what the crazy part is?"
"4312800","4313380"," It's not the math."
"4313640","4314500"," It's the reading and writing."
"4315620","4318740"," It's the like context and syntax and all that kind of stuff. "
"4319080","4324000"," You only get when you're like a voracious reader, voracious writer."
"4325000","4330860"," You don't get on a phone or a tablet or the internets, the series of tubes or any of that"
"4330860","4331340"," kind of stuff."
"4331660","4333120"," If you got kids out there, I'm going to tell you something. "
"4334260","4336040"," Throw all that tablet shit away."
"4336460","4339940"," I'm going to tell you something like you got kids just get rid of it."
"4340360","4347180"," You had an epiphany over this past week where I was like, they say they don't need it, but they"
"4347180","4349740"," do like they got to read and write. "
"4350440","4352020"," The computers are not good enough."
"4352580","4360300"," A lot of this has to do with understanding syntax, understanding context."
"4361760","4365140"," And it's not an easy thing to learn quickly. "
"4365780","4367900"," It's like it's something that takes years."
"4368880","4370060"," Math can be done quickly."
"4370580","4371980"," I know some people will disagree with that. "
"4371980","4379420"," But math, you can repetitively teach yourself equations and theories and things like this, right?"
"4379700","4381800"," Like repetitively, repetitively, repetitively."
"4382420","4383500"," Quickly learn this."
"4385240","4389760"," Reading and writing, believe it or not, is like decades. "
"4390340","4391300"," It's a lifelong process."
"4392140","4395900"," And it's wild because I'm getting up in a tangent right now."
"4395900","4402460"," The whole other part of this is I was talking to my daughter and I was like, you know, your"
"4402460","4412300"," kids likely will not, if you have kids, your kids will likely not be able to differentiate between"
"4412300","4416540"," a bot that writes something and a human that writes something. "
"4418040","4426200"," And you're the starting generations of not being able to recognize astroturfing and bot writing."
"4426680","4434580"," Like they're on the edge where they're comfortable and it feels normalish to read something that's"
"4434580","4440340"," been prepared, even in conjunction or with help from bots."
"4442000","4445060"," So they're like, they're on the cusp right now. "
"4445060","4451000"," If you talk to someone that's older, it's very easy for an older person to say, say, yeah, that's"
"4451000","4451700"," astroturfing."
"4452700","4456020"," That's a bot or someone's trying to push something here, right?"
"4456080","4456940"," It's very easy to see."
"4457460","4460240"," It's very much like going grocery shopping. "
"4460760","4465480"," If you're used to someone checking you out and you're like, I know what this is."
"4466240","4469740"," I know what it means to be checked out at a grocery store and then a new generation has no"
"4469740","4470700"," experience with that."
"4471440","4475520"," So if you ask someone that's young, hey, do you like someone checking you out on the grocery line?"
"4476160","4478220"," Generally, they're going to say, no, I don't care. "
"4478220","4479900"," I love self-checkouts."
"4479900","4480500"," It's great, right?"
"4481180","4482040"," That's my only experience."
"4482340","4484680"," I don't have an experience with someone checking me out. "
"4484820","4488720"," Someone that's older, generally speaking, I know there's going to be one of you in the chat that's"
"4488720","4491220"," going to say, I like self-checkout."
"4492740","4497580"," If you look in the past, these have the whole line of people checking you out."
"4497740","4498240"," They're really fast. "
"4498500","4499060"," It took the job serious."
"4499920","4500380"," A lot of other stuff."
"4500800","4504140"," So that relates back to reading and writing specifically. "
"4505800","4508380"," We're talking to my daughter right now with the SAT stuff."
"4508520","4510700"," I'm like, you've got to down the tablet."
"4511380","4512100"," Next two years. "
"4513300","4514600"," She does lots of reading and writing."
"4514800","4519780"," I'm like, these next two years, you need to bury yourself in these books."
"4520120","4520900"," She reads a ton of books. "
"4521040","4523120"," This summer she read a ton of books."
"4523260","4527740"," I'm like, you've got to read this stuff so that you can understand context in a conversation or a"
"4527740","4528620"," written word or an essay."
"4529340","4532440"," What people mean when someone writes you something?"
"4533020","4534720"," What are they trying to convey to you?"
"4534920","4537180"," You can't go over your head. "
"4537320","4539980"," You can't be there going, I read this, and I think they want this."
"4540640","4544200"," They actually want something different or something nefarious or something with an undercurrent."
"4544720","4546400"," They're trying to tell you something without you knowing. "
"4547140","4548780"," You have to get that hint from people."
"4549620","4549900"," All right."
"4550180","4552580"," Sorry for that. "
"4553560","4554460"," GME, we did that."
"4554600","4555000"," We did Tesla."
"4555420","4561720"," We're going to go right back really quick and give an outlook for next week for spy specifically. "
"4561720","4570880"," This should this should pertain as well to this should pertain as well to the market at large."
"4571200","4571400"," Okay."
"4572240","4573440"," Market at large. "
"4576680","4583700"," We will back on the we will spy chart for next week, today being Friday, right?"
"4585900","4589860"," We are breaking above the half hour trigger right now on spy."
"4592480","4598180"," We have the hourly trigger currently that's at four thirty seven fifty one."
"4598460","4599740"," I'm going to bring this down for you. "
"4599980","4600760"," I was moving this all around."
"4600900","4601260"," I apologize."
"4602840","4604920"," Four thirty seven fifty one right here. "
"4606380","4607780"," So just for today."
"4609740","4615120"," I'm going to give you the outlook two minute outlook for spy today and then into next week."
"4615900","4619500"," Currently right now we have a price above the five minute trigger. "
"4620080","4624260"," We have a full plane forming above here on spy."
"4624600","4625620"," So upside expectations."
"4625740","4630040"," Maybe the confirmation down here in the five minute trigger upside target number one. "
"4630100","4631660"," We've just hit at four thirty."
"4631940","4632820"," Excuse me right now."
"4633120","4633760"," Four thirty. "
"4633920","4634300"," Hold on a second."
"4635520","4638660"," Upside target number one has been hit at four thirty five eighty nine."
"4639140","4643780"," We're now looking for upside target number two, which is four thirty seven fifty one. "
"4643780","4646040"," So they can delete some of this stuff."
"4646940","4649520"," Move all this over for move all this over for you."
"4658800","4660380"," Four thirty five ninety three. "
"4664950","4665950"," Right there."
"4667450","4669510"," That's PT one already hit it."
"4672070","4674610"," That's PT one right there PT two. "
"4675710","4677090"," Four today."
"4682510","4684550"," Four thirty seven forty four."
"4698880","4701080"," Four thirty seven forty four. "
"4702760","4704060"," Ready to hit PT one."
"4709730","4711410"," Four forty five sixteen."
"4713850","4717680"," Move this over next week. "
"4728150","4729650"," PT three."
"4731810","4734430"," Four forty five point sixteen."
"4738250","4739070"," Right there. "
"4739170","4740030"," This is for today."
"4741570","4748430"," Get rid of that stuff right there."
"4749550","4752550"," I'm going to draw this in for you PT one. "
"4753650","4754570"," One now."
"4756870","4760030"," That's PT one right there to PT one PT two."
"4760430","4761570"," Right there. "
"4762410","4771230"," That'd be my expectation for today."
"4771730","4773090"," It changes to like some smaller."
"4790060","4792340"," Make this smaller here. "
"4803340","4811140"," Okay, so two minutes two minute preview into the clothes today expecting an upper range target of"
"4811140","4812600"," four forty five sixteen to the bell."
"4813740","4816280"," Look out for rejection today."
"4816700","4819140"," I'm going to move these again. "
"4821680","4823760"," Look out for rejection today."
"4825000","4827640"," Above that four thirty seven forty four."
"4827780","4829800"," Keep that target in mind above here. "
"4830380","4834420"," If we begin to squeeze above four thirty seven forty four you're going to want to see it hold."
"4835400","4839320"," So the initial target here for today is going to be four thirty seven forty four."
"4839640","4841880"," You want to break above it to four thirty eight sixty. "
"4842540","4847160"," Hold four thirty seven forty four and then begin to try to trade four thirty nine eighty three."
"4847660","4850860"," And then ultimately a squeeze higher in a four forty five sixteen."
"4851000","4852400"," Do I think you get the four forty five sixteen?"
"4852420","4853280"," I doubt it. "
"4853580","4854400"," I really do."
"4854520","4855600"," I think that it's down here."
"4855680","4859080"," I think your ultimate end of the day goal is four thirty nine eighty three. "
"4859640","4864540"," Into next week expectation is that we trade higher into next week."
"4865020","4867540"," We're going to trade four forty five fifty."
"4868840","4869820"," Into next week. "
"4870140","4874880"," And then the I'm going to look for the bears to take over so whether it's something like this."
"4874880","4881780"," Roll back down settle on the early trigger and then begin to trade this four forty five ninety"
"4881780","4884240"," eight four forty three somewhere in here next week."
"4884780","4891060"," And I'm going to look for the bears to take over once again next week into end of the month"
"4891060","4894140"," and begin to trade this down into Friday. "
"4895080","4898760"," To that four twenty eight price target for next Friday."
"4899500","4904600"," One thing I would say is if you're theta gang right where we are right now for next week."
"4904640","4907100"," So for theta gang right where we are next week. "
"4907720","4909700"," This is kind of your place in here right."
"4910220","4914720"," So you set up your flies for next week if you think hey we're going to consolidate and trade"
"4914720","4915800"," sideways in the next week."
"4916060","4923880"," I do a big fat fly with four fifty nine four fifty one somewhere up in there probably four fifty"
"4923880","4926740"," four fifty two four fifty nine on the upside. "
"4926740","4931880"," And then the downside legs would be four twenty eight below four twenty eight four twenty six"
"4931880","4932600"," something like that."
"4933260","4938840"," For that sideways consolidation trade in the S&P five hundred you're kind of in the perfect sweet"
"4938840","4939960"," spot right now right."
"4940620","4945860"," For this sideways trade for theta gang into next week not going to expect too much of a move higher"
"4945860","4949000"," and I'm not going to expect too much of a move lower into next week. "
"4949000","4951440"," Then this four twenty eight down below."
"4951920","4956020"," What's my thesis here for bears in the next week if you want to bear thesis."
"4957040","4962780"," You need to get underneath four twenty eight today you need to get underneath four twenty five four"
"4962780","4963300"," twenty six. "
"4963760","4966860"," But next week you want to begin to trade underneath."
"4967660","4970720"," Let's see you get up there to that four forty five sell this down."
"4971360","4976100"," Get underneath that four twenty eight and that's your next leg down to four twenty. "
"4976760","4983300"," Ultimate price target into end of quarter for bears is going to be that four twenty four twenty is"
"4983300","4986840"," the target for bears for the end of quarter."
"4987060","4991660"," So we've got almost that we got what another week to left and you got another month so six weeks"
"4991660","4995740"," from now four twenty would be the target for bears."
"4999060","5004220"," Bolts must get above this four forty three four forty five next week. "

"5983490","5985710"," They're absolutely, I had, so I had puts yesterday."
"5986790","5988530"," I was trading with a binky really quick. "
"5988910","5993030"," Yesterday I was pretty big and I'm like, I'm like, I got fucking puts here."
"5993190","5997670"," They're like, let's say it said puts that I was like, I want 30 cents."
"5997850","5998810"," They put a limit selling puts. "
"5999730","6000770"," They wouldn't give me the 30."
"6000950","6001510"," They're like 26."
"6002010","6002350"," Take 26. "
"6003010","6003510"," How about 27?"
"6003830","6004030"," Take 27?"
"6004910","6005750"," I'm like, no."

"6013930","6017150"," So I put a seller at 26, I think, or 27."
"6017150","6022190"," I went back down, filled the 26 and I was like, okay, we've done three minutes later."
"6022870","6024790"," Classed down 32, 33 cents. "
"6024990","6033130"," I'm like, how can"
"6033130","6036950"," I tell?"
"6038050","6039510"," How do I like slippage?"
"6040110","6042710"," I find slippage in the options chain."
"6042710","6046850"," I find slippage in the options chain usually."
"6051670","6054210"," Like pennies, like two, three, four pennies. "
"6054850","6056130"," But it means a lot."
"6056330","6057650"," It's like, it means a lot."
"6058630","6061030"," It can be like the difference between a winning trade and a losing trade. "
"6064590","6066230"," I'm talking about the slippage."
"6066410","6069490"," I'm talking about the pay for order flow."
"6069650","6073410"," So what they do is they're selling order flow. "
"6073410","6077490"," It's like they're offering you an option, let's say, for five cents."
"6078870","6081570"," But it's only worth three cents, right?"
"6081930","6083550"," So you buy that option at five cents."
"6084230","6085610"," Mealy drops down to three cents. "
"6086530","6091490"," A very stupid way to describe it, but that's what that's what does happen."
"6091750","6099410"," And there's been claims at different times that that amount of money fluctuates with what they"
"6099410","6102930"," think they can get away with until it's back in the public eye again."
"6102930","6106310"," And then they're like, oh, yeah, we're not going to do this right now. "
"6106310","6107410"," We're only going to make a couple pennies."
"6107750","6111810"," And when they're not looking, they're like, yeah, we're going to make five, six pennies, right?"
"6112090","6113990"," And then, of course, it's like under the microscope again."
"6113990","6116130"," And then it goes back down to one or two pennies. "
"6116990","6118710"," I'll see it sometimes in brokers."
"6119810","6126110"," I haven't run a test recently, but when it was really bad a couple of years ago, I had opened"
"6126110","6129250"," think five brokers at one time."
"6129990","6135050"," Prime brokers and then like Robin Hoods and Webulls and Tacy. "
"6135570","6140490"," And you could see variations in the fills, right?"
"6140690","6145030"," You'd see like a two, three, four penny variations saying all of that."
"6145850","6149970"," When I put spreads on, I oftentimes will call my broker for a spread."
"6150750","6154670"," And I will say to them, I want this price on this leg. "
"6155510","6157230"," And can you do that for me?"
"6157290","6158410"," And it's not the price published."
"6159670","6160830"," It's usually lower."
"6161530","6163030"," And they say yes to it. "
"6163750","6167750"," So I know they've got room even on their end to say yes to a trade."
"6168010","6171010"," Like, hey, this trade, but this is at 27 cents."
"6171190","6171970"," Can I get it at 24?"
"6173310","6173810"," And they will. "
"6174110","6174510"," They will."
"6174850","6179410"," I shouldn't tell you that, but go call on your brokers and make it bad for the rest of us."
"6179410","6183850"," But you can call your broker and negotiate a price, believe it or not. "
"6183850","6186030"," I don't know if you know that or not, but you can."
"6188050","6189210"," Yeah, you got it."
"6189970","6194790"," Prime brokers tend to be less, well, not tend to. "
"6194910","6196390"," Prime brokers don't sell flow."
"6197130","6199310"," They back it by their money and their bank."
"6199650","6204630"," So if you're like trading options on a prime broker, it's usually a better price. "
"6204830","6209550"," And you can usually even get a better price just by what it's showing."
"6209830","6210590"," Other times you can just call."
"6214280","6215880"," You haven't fallen U.S. Steel. "
"6216080","6216740"," They've been doing great."
"6217920","6223960"," I would look at U.S. Steel as, what was the, what was the?"
"6225920","6227740"," I can't remember who this was."
"6228460","6233160"," Do you remember the hospital or the biotech deal that was going to happen?"
"6233980","6238200"," And we had the initial squeeze up in that company and then it stayed up. "
"6238320","6241260"," Was it, was it biotech or was it a online tutoring company?"
"6241260","6241780"," I can't remember."
"6243000","6245860"," But it just stayed up and then it continued on when the deal was closed."
"6246380","6247760"," So I forget what that ticker was. "
"6247860","6251760"," We were looking at it months ago and I was like, nope, we take it, it had squeezed up."
"6252060","6255560"," I think someone said it's risky here."
"6256120","6259580"," If the deal falls through and it just kept stair-stepping higher and higher. "
"6261160","6262260"," What ticker that was."
"6267620","6272600"," Any of the prime banks, any of the prime banks, any of the big boys, any of the prime banks."
"6274900","6276540"," Prime brokers are prime banks. "
"6276800","6283180"," So if you're trading stock through a prime bank, well, like your JPMs, your GSs, any of the big"
"6283180","6292540"," boys, anyone that backs the underlying with actual cash, has large cash reserves on hand."
"6305600","6308720"," Next week, we've got nothing scheduled for today."
"6308920","6310820"," Nothing scheduled for next Monday. "
"6311020","6313780"," We do have the old guys."
"6314080","6314520"," They're going to send."
"6315540","6321520"," Durgis is going to send all the hookers up to Wyoming for the old men to get together and bang"
"6321520","6322040"," hookers. "
"6322040","6324980"," So we've got that coming up next week."
"6325820","6328400"," We've also got existing home sales on Tuesday."
"6329180","6333080"," You've got a Wednesday SAP Flash services PMI. "
"6333300","6339440"," And then Thursday, you get the Fed officials interviews from the Jackson or from the hookers hole"
"6339440","6341220"," up in Jackson, Wyoming."
"6341800","6343160"," Great place, by the way, if you've never been there."
"6344180","6344920"," Oh, wait a minute here. "
"6345860","6346900"," Hold on here."
"6346980","6347540"," We're in the one minute trigger."
"6348180","6350960"," A little bit of squeezing going on before we continue with this. "
"6351140","6352640"," We got to check the five in here."
"6352780","6353700"," Oh, dude, right there."
"6360000","6361460"," All right, I'm long right there. "
"6368350","6369730"," Right there, bruh."
"6375880","6377400"," Right in there."
"6390270","6391750"," First PT right there. "
"6395850","6397090"," I'll make that PT one."
"6397250","6398430"," Now is the new PT right there."
"6398750","6399790"," 436 41. "
"6404370","6405830"," This PT two right here."
"6407770","6409450"," 437 44 right up here."
"6413350","6416410"," So we've got Jackson hole and what's Jerome going to do?"
"6416570","6417350"," We already know, right?"
"6417830","6418930"," He's going to be like, I did my job. "
"6419290","6420850"," He's going to do the mission accomplished."
"6421830","6424330"," I bought time for the market, right?"
"6426310","6429610"," Is that what you guys think that that's what he's going to do when he goes out there to Wyoming?"
"6430030","6431070"," That's what I think he's going to do."
"6434750","6438290"," Yeah, we talked about leaps on US still last week, right?"
"6438510","6441510"," I think on Monday, we talked about just putting some leaps on. "
"6441850","6443150"," I'm for that trade."
"6443490","6446790"," So it'll become, I'm going to, I'll say two things."
"6448770","6453870"," If it, if it falls through, you know where, where, where you know where X is going, right?"
"6454090","6454950"," The fucking dumpster. "
"6455390","6456170"," We know that."
"6457410","6461850"," We also know that wherever that promises what X will be."
"6462930","6468590"," If it is under the umbrella, then we know it's going to go to the moon. "
"6468830","6474310"," We also know that it will become the most shorted stock in the stock market."
"6475010","6475950"," I would expect."
"6477330","6479370"," Um, I would expect that to happen. "
"6479590","6484630"," So the other idea on next would be make sure you have a price target."
"6484630","6490290"," Be like, I want to hit this number and I'm going to take the money and run because I'm assuming"
"6490290","6491350"," at some point that."
"6493250","6495330"," Four thirty sevens are what I'm on right now. "
"6498230","6501870"," So like X, um, we can look at X if you want."
"6502210","6505330"," I looked at, I did not look at leaves with you guys on stream on Monday."
"6505490","6508470"," It's where I, it's where I said like January twenty five. "
"6508490","6510370"," I forget the numbers that I gave on those."
"6510590","6511770"," I didn't buy myself, but."
"6521090","6522410"," Trading forty eight right now. "
"6523210","6531420"," Uh, if you want to know what it'll look like, it's one minute ticker right now, what I'm expecting."
"6532320","6533060"," I'm hoping happens."
"6535040","6536580"," It's kind of failure in there. "
"6537640","6539080"," And you'd hire right there."
"6540060","6541420"," And the target right there."
"6543020","6553880"," Uh, so"
"6553880","6557760"," then on Thursday, I've got the set officials interviewing from Jackson Hall. "
"6558200","6560160"," You've got claims, all bunch of good ball."
"6560780","6564040"," We've got Powell speaking on Friday at ten oh five."
"6564280","6566100"," This is great ball back here too. "
"6566460","6567440"," Hold on a second."
"6567580","6568060"," What's going on?"
"6570200","6572280"," We've got some good ball down here."
"6572280","6574440"," This is the Powell giving his opening speech. "
"6575200","6576920"," You've got good ball right here."
"6577380","6579740"," Uh, on Thursday at time."
"6579920","6582800"," So I'm going to expect, uh, gonna expect next week. "
"6583500","6587340"," It's a pretty, I'm going to expect it to be pretty bad into that Thursday Friday."
"6588340","6590020"," I'm not going to expect it to be good."
"6590620","6591780"," Still long right now. "
"6592840","6595020"," I'm not sold."
"6596260","6597440"," What else do we have here?"
"6597960","6598740"," Back to the heat map."
"6600500","6602600"," Oracle's up point seven, four percent right now. "
"6602900","6603900"," I just heads up on that one."
"6604100","6606520"," Netflix up point two or five, two percent."
"6617220","6618280"," Twelve thirty seven. "
"6618580","6619240"," Please don't."
"6619420","6623540"," If like I'm like thinking to myself, I'm like, please don't pin me in this, in this chop in here."
"6624100","6625940"," Like, please don't do that. "
"6627040","6629660"," I have to end the, I could leave the broadcast up."
"6629660","6633880"," I think have, have a meeting after two meetings."
"6633880","6639160"," I've got a dev meeting at some point, but then I have a larger meeting. "
"6639160","6639880"," I have to do."
"6642700","6645040"," But I might be able to leave this stream up."
"6646600","6647440"," It's possible. "
"6656150","6657010"," What do you guys ask?"
"6657290","6658030"," What am I missing here?"
"6659430","6660610"," What are you asking for Raj?"
"6667660","6669060"," No, you have to go back and watch."
"6669320","6670360"," You have to go back and watch."
"6671280","6671940"," You have to go back. "
"6672100","6676700"," Raj, you need to like stop right now and go back and watch the original video in the series."
"6678340","6679400"," Just watch that video."
"6681740","6683620"," It's a three part, we're in a three part series. "
"6684080","6689480"," You just go back and watch video one, then watch video two, and then watch this video, I guess, and"
"6689480","6690220"," you'll get your answer."
"6695270","6697290"," Yeah, we talked about X two."
"6700950","6703370"," Yeah, you have to go back and watch those videos. "
"6706450","6710050"," Do you, if you're asking, like, do we reject off hourly trigger?"
"6710390","6710970"," We do."
"6711310","6715570"," We reject off hourly and half hour triggers right now."
"6716370","6719130"," Half hour trigger or the hourly trigger, Raj, is right here. "
"6719950","6720370"," That's where it is."
"6723510","6725390"," Do you want to write that in here, maybe?"
"6728590","6730170"," Our hourly trigger is right here, brother."
"6733740","6734500"," Does that help?"
"6735460","6736540"," Maybe that helps. "
"6739460","6740980"," Our hourly trigger is right there."
"6749940","6750940"," Yeah, does it help your brother?"
"6753200","6758140"," I don't really ever hold calls or puts on triggers anyways."
"6758140","6762180"," I'll wait until we reject below it or accept higher. "
"6762560","6764000"," I take the money and run up there."
"6765640","6773640"," I don't ever stay in like, if we're coming into the early trigger, I never hold it anyways."
"6773880","6774460"," I'm like, I'm out. "
"6774940","6778000"," If we're coming down into the early trigger, I'll put risk on."
"6778500","6782880"," If we're above our early trigger, if I come down into our early trigger, I'll put risk on if Velo"
"6782880","6783660"," matches with it."
"6784060","6790000"," If velocity matches with it, if it doesn't, I'll put it on and I'll have stops like hard stops"
"6790000","6790340"," underneath. "
"6791160","6794440"," So I don't get like taken to the cleaners or anything like that."
"6803290","6804790"," Just consolidation right now."
"6804830","6805770"," I'm watching it here in the background. "
"6808670","6811210"," Just sitting on the half hour trigger right now."
"6811270","6811990"," I'm just waiting for the squeeze."
"6817130","6819670"," Maybe I can show you guys this and switch over. "
"6824950","6829110"," So right now, I'm still looking to kind of bearish down here, right?"
"6829730","6830850"," Pretty negative down here."
"6833030","6834730"," Minus 18-ish."
"6836370","6837230"," Minus 25. "
"6838670","6839510"," That's what I'm looking for."
"6840290","6841350"," Just right here."
"6842830","6846330"," The trade that I'm looking for is this trade right here. "
"6847490","6848350"," See right there?"
"6848670","6849830"," 437, some change."
"6850930","6852050"," You see that trade right there?"
"6852150","6853150"," That's the trade I'm looking for."
"6853610","6855230"," This is the trade that I'm long in right now. "
"6855390","6856910"," So as long as we go up there, we're good."
"6857650","6859890"," We begin to red bar it down, right?"
"6860650","6861490"," There's where my stops are."
"6864170","6866850"," Just switch it over to the regular chart right here. "
"6872130","6873650"," So just so you can see it."
"6875950","6877390"," Looking for that, right?"
"6877950","6879210"," Get the little failure right there."
"6880050","6880430"," Look there. "
"6881230","6882030"," Get above and hold it."
"6882170","6883290"," And then a big squeeze right there."
"6884650","6886450"," This is that trade right there. "
"6902860","6904300"," Let me get this shit done."
"6904480","6909320"," I'm going to turn this fucking stream off."
"6910420","6912500"," Livestreams will be back up again on Monday. "
"6913400","6915380"," Let's talk about earlier this week."
"6915720","6917060"," We're going to have a quick conversation here."
"6920740","6922680"," This is a great trade. "
"6922900","6924100"," Trade in 54 cents right now."
"6924380","6927500"," So we're going to talk about what happened to the trade."
"6927500","6928220"," So we're going to talk about what happened on Monday. "
"6928760","6929620"," So on Monday."
"6931140","6932360"," So on Monday, right?"
"6932540","6933860"," I bought zero dates on Monday."
"6935020","6937960"," And my thesis says, hey, we're going up into this bell. "
"6938600","6939940"," Not down, right?"
"6941040","6944520"," Now my my calls that I was in."
"6944560","6947280"," I was DC and DC and DC and DC and right."
"6949080","6951380"," And trade in 57 cents right now. "
"6951820","6954500"," So I'm DC and DC and DC and right."
"6954880","6957000"," And the chat specifically on Twitch."
"6958560","6959620"," No offense to Twitch. "
"6959800","6964140"," I love Twitch, but Twitch chat was extremely bearish."
"6964300","6965880"," Like, hey, we're going down into this bell."
"6966220","6967760"," We're going to go down to the depths of hell. "
"6968540","6970000"," On month, I believe it was Monday."
"6972320","6974020"," And I had an issue with that."
"6974020","6977560"," So I don't want to be like from reading the chat. "
"6977820","6979440"," I'm reading someone saying it's going down."
"6979680","6982660"," I got like thousands of fucking dollars on this trade."
"6983380","6987900"," Now, if I had sold that trade, I would have lost significant amount of money. "
"6988620","6990520"," I don't mind bearishness in the chat."
"6990800","6991980"," I'm okay with the bearishness in the chat."
"6992160","6996420"," But when it starts to get like a coffee, I'm like, ah, it's a little bit too weird. "
"6997840","7000520"," And so I held those calls into the bell."
"7000520","7005740"," And I didn't make money, but I didn't get my ass handed to me."
"7005880","7012320"," And we blasted up into that clothes, like blasted, like ripped faces into the first, even into the"
"7012320","7013800"," first five minutes of after the close. "
"7014540","7018280"," Those calls went to like, I think 26 or 27 cents, they'd be wrong."
"7018440","7020560"," It's like, I was at like nine to 17."
"7020760","7022180"," I started taking the money off the table. "
"7022920","7024800"," And I think afterwards it went even higher."
"7025740","7026640"," No, that's not really the point."
"7026640","7031080"," The point is that you like, I don't know. "
"7031460","7034620"," Like there's always someone in the chat that's right, right?"
"7034740","7035140"," That's the case."
"7035620","7036860"," Someone's always right in the chat."
"7037280","7038680"," Whenever they're wrong, they disappear. "
"7040460","7043060"," And then someone else will say, look, I was right, right?"
"7043260","7044520"," Well, I'm sitting here trying to trade."
"7045140","7049360"," And I'm reading the chat and I'm like, ah, you know, this chat's got getting a little out of hand"
"7049360","7049820"," right now."
"7049960","7054200"," Now, there's some other points about that chat as well that I actually went back to read through"
"7054200","7054480"," the chat. "
"7054480","7057260"," There's a bunch of stuff that I made mistakes on too."
"7058060","7061260"," So someone had brought up NDX and NDS."
"7062500","7065660"," I didn't realize this, but I'll show you guys something really quick. "
"7066040","7066800"," Something fucked up."
"7067580","7069560"," And we'll ask you not to be able to recreate it right now."
"7071860","7074320"," So on the trigger screen, well, it's a couple of things. "
"7074640","7078380"," First, I look at NDX on Webull on a different screener."
"7078880","7084300"," So I've got a screener like way up here over here that shows me all this, all the sub sectors."
"7085040","7085880"," It's like I look at Dixie. "
"7086140","7086920"," I look at HYG."
"7087580","7090700"," I look at Dixie, HYG VIX."
"7091500","7092040"," I look at NDX. "
"7092940","7093580"," I like it."
"7093860","7094580"," Index doesn't move slow."
"7094780","7098780"," It's easier for me to see it, but I have a start down here that shows. "
"7100500","7101820"," And it was delayed."
"7102480","7105580"," And what I didn't notice was that I can recreate it right now."
"7105720","7108300"," So perfect. "
"7109520","7110600"," I'm going to do it right now for you."
"7110600","7111760"," So I want to show you guys something."
"7114260","7118400"," So I'm going to go to, let me bring this thing up over here. "
"7125760","7126540"," Figure screen."
"7126740","7126780"," Sorry."
"7126940","7129660"," This is the right screen right here. "
"7129900","7130040"," Okay."
"7131480","7133840"," So I want you guys to see something here."
"7134320","7136080"," How do I bring this down for you?"
"7140600","7141720"," How do I do this?"
"7145930","7148490"," Let me see if I can do it this way, maybe. "
"7154170","7158030"," So I didn't realize I'm saying bring something up here."
"7162640","7167720"," So when I type in NDX here, right, I type in NDX and I hit enter."
"7169780","7170220"," Watch. "
"7170360","7170600"," Yeah."
"7170820","7172980"," So it brings up NDQ for me right here."
"7173100","7173200"," Right. "
"7173320","7174280"," This is real time."
"7174960","7176240"," This is real time."
"7179080","7182120"," Nasdaq, NDX, real time Nasdaq. "
"7182380","7186860"," If you type in NDX, watch me type in NDX, NDX, right?"
"7187140","7189460"," Hit the enter and it brings up NDQ."
"7189640","7192340"," So this is real time Nasdaq."
"7192920","7196940"," I think possibly on Monday, I had typed in NDX. "
"7196940","7200680"," And then I clicked on it or something like that."
"7200840","7202540"," Maybe I'd done that or something like that."
"7202720","7207640"," So I'm still looking at real time on a different chart, but the one that you were looking at down"
"7207640","7212760"," below was possibly the delayed version or not the real version. "
"7213140","7217120"," Normally when you hit NDX, you just hit enter and it's automatically NDQ."
"7217320","7221600"," So let me know if you're the person that was discussing that or whatever."
"7221740","7222980"," I appreciate you saying something. "
"7227020","7230280"," Now getting back to the chat."
"7230980","7232340"," Let's get back to the chat records."
"7232560","7233820"," We're not done with the chat in Monday. "
"7234400","7234880"," I'm going to be honest."
"7235080","7236360"," You're going to talk to you guys about something here."
"7237240","7238120"," That's very important. "
"7238560","7243600"," So streaming, there's a couple of things that you guys need to realize here."
"7244440","7245520"," So streaming, okay."
"7246460","7248280"," Most people do not stream. "
"7248620","7249940"," I have to say something to you guys."
"7250520","7255200"," Most people do not stream five days a week year round."
"7255380","7255960"," They just don't. "
"7256040","7259340"," They don't do it for eight hours a day, seven hours a day, six hours a day."
"7259740","7260160"," They don't."
"7260260","7261320"," And when they do, they take breaks. "
"7261820","7265840"," They take like summer vacation, spring vacation, that kind of stuff."
"7266660","7272220"," So you've got me here five days a week in and out at nine, nine o'clock in more than"
"7272220","7276600"," nine thirty, whatever, ten to four or five, whatever, if it's a long day or something like that."
"7276600","7281000"," So you guys have me here with you a lot of time. "
"7282480","7285700"," So when I'm here with you that much, right?"
"7286700","7290820"," And then I come in on a Monday and I'm watching this chat go crazy."
"7291880","7291960"," Right?"
"7292100","7294500"," The chat's just going fucking bananas all day long."
"7294500","7296640"," It's like, what are these people talking about right now?"
"7297340","7299260"," I'm not quite getting what's going on here. "
"7299500","7305040"," And I don't know if people realize that I'm day trading zero dates."
"7305040","7310560"," So you've got trades that are a week out a month out, six months out, year out, right?"
"7310760","7311120"," You get underlying."
"7311540","7313980"," I've got stops on fucking stock and all that kind of stuff. "
"7314540","7316240"," I even have what I don't have it on."
"7316400","7317620"," I've got half of it on right now."
"7318020","7321200"," I actually closed out sold calls yesterday. "
"7321680","7323520"," I've got spreads out there right now."
"7323820","7329480"," It's like there's different time frames that we're looking at depending upon what we're trading."
"7330200","7334860"," So you have to like kind of be kind of to be like, like number one, you have to kind"
"7334860","7336720"," of be like, well, what are we trading here?"
"7336880","7336940"," Right?"
"7337060","7338340"," Is the market overall going down?"
"7338480","7338540"," Yeah. "
"7338640","7339060"," We know that."
"7339600","7341380"," How far is the market going down?"
"7341540","7342100"," Yeah, we know that."
"7342220","7347900"," I felt like I was like, yeah, I did these videos, these private videos so that people know where we"
"7347900","7348460"," are in the market. "
"7348460","7349520"," So I can't be told."
"7350180","7355620"," Hey, he knows where we're going or knows where we are, know there's a risk of a roll over."
"7355720","7356520"," And then we're day trading. "
"7357000","7362220"," So you got like the bearish for the downside and you've got where are we actually going today at"
"7362220","7362720"," this moment."
"7363480","7366020"," There's a big distinct difference in that stuff."
"7366560","7371300"," Now the chat is going back because staying in this fucking chat for Monday. "
"7372100","7374440"," So I'm here with you guys day in, day out."
"7374760","7374960"," Okay."
"7375440","7377660"," Praying with you guys with no breaks. "
"7378480","7383980"," And so when I'm reading the chat on Monday, you know, I'm looking at the chat from Monday and some"
"7383980","7386800"," of it on Friday of last week and some of the past week."
"7387440","7389580"," And I'm like, you know, I spend a ton of time doing this."
"7389580","7395680"," I had some people this week said something to me about making money or something off of"
"7395680","7397200"," subscriptions and stuff. "
"7397380","7401440"," And I was like, you guys don't understand the cost, this cost me to do."
"7402100","7408940"," Like the time is unbelievably valuable to me to not be streaming."
"7409640","7413080"," I don't want to say that, but like I don't need to stream. "
"7414040","7415520"," And the stream costs me money."
"7415520","7420160"," It costs me time, like stupid time that's very expensive."
"7421000","7424900"," And it also costs me a ton in other things like services. "
"7425380","7428800"," Like I got every month I get bills in that you guys actually pay for it."
"7428860","7433020"," When you guys are tipping and you guys are donating and you guys are subscribing, your money"
"7433020","7437400"," actually goes towards most of it goes towards that stuff."
"7437660","7442760"," I still have to pay taxes, still have to pay to have the accounting done like the equipment, the"
"7442760","7449820"," services, the fucking goddamn fiber bullshit, all the other shit I got to pay for. "
"7451100","7457180"," So you're like, there's this question about like, you know, why, like, or did I say to myself?"
"7457880","7459480"," So I'm like, yeah, do I need to be here?"
"7459640","7461100"," Like these fucking people need me here?"
"7461620","7463480"," I'm like, because I don't fucking need to be here."
"7463620","7465640"," I'm not going to be douche about this, but I'm going to be honest with you."
"7466020","7467380"," Like, I don't fucking need to be here. "
"7468300","7472200"," I can be off fucking trading on my own, hanging out with friends, my wife kid."
"7472400","7476980"," My other thing too is like my wife and kids, you know, like they got school starting up, but I'm"
"7476980","7478360"," not there for them and that kind of stuff."
"7478860","7481920"," So if it's like, yeah, if it's going to be like that, I'll just take a week off, you know,"
"7482920","7487300"," rather than you guys like happier when we're, when we're going up all the time, you're not going to"
"7487300","7489700"," be happy when we're going down and that kind of stuff. "
"7491260","7497360"," Then, you know, maybe it's time to take a break."
"7497360","7497840"," Like, hey, you know what?"
"7498040","7499740"," Captain will take the break from livestreaming."
"7499840","7504020"," I'll go trade on my own, make a bunch of money and I don't need to see his show anymore,"
"7504340","7504480"," right?"
"7504740","7506080"," So that kind of works for me too. "
"7507420","7512800"," I'm not trying to be against this coming off as asshole-y, but I need to say it to you"
"7512800","7518200"," guys, because when we go back to the livestream on Monday, hopefully I'm refreshed."
"7518600","7522120"," So from my end, I have like thicker skin on Monday, right?"
"7522260","7523740"," I need to have thicker skin, take a break."
"7524520","7527040"," The other thing that I need to do, I've got a bunch of shit. "
"7527040","7529320"," I've got to do it for my family, which I've been getting done this week."
"7529480","7530720"," So that makes me happy too."
"7531740","7539400"," The other side of it too is I need moderators in the stream chats to make sure that the"
"7539400","7540860"," conversations are constructive. "
"7541600","7543240"," Up or down, I don't care, just constructive."
"7544100","7552540"," So maybe I have to look towards demodying people or just reaching out to find people that can take"
"7552540","7557840"," a more active role in moderating YouTube and Twitch, actively through the day."
"7557940","7565720"," If that doesn't happen, if we can't find that in the community to do, I'm going to have to do"
"7565720","7566280"," something else. "
"7566500","7568960"," So if I do something else, I'm going to tell you what it is."
"7569440","7572340"," It's going to be like $10 or $20 to talk in the chat."
"7572800","7574300"," We just won't have anybody in the chat. "
"7574440","7575440"," You guys will be like, fuck you, Captain."
"7575440","7576140"," I ain't paying that."
"7576640","7577500"," So we'll do that. "
"7577500","7581620"," We can, we can, we can, there's answers to this issue."
"7581960","7585800"," So I don't know what the answer is."
"7585840","7591440"," I think the answer, I think the positive answer, like the way to go answer is we get some more"
"7591440","7592660"," active moderating. "
"7592920","7596380"," So this active moderating is not the kind of modding that you guys do."
"7596900","7602920"," That's where we, like you open up stream labs, like a stream labs dashboard in the background."
"7604300","7608480"," And if you're watching the stream all day long, you're actually in there moderating the chat. "
"7609020","7610300"," For all kinds of good stuff too."
"7610800","7613400"," Like we got a bunch of like tools and stuff we don't use and polls."
"7613720","7616540"," We don't use and games that we don't use. "
"7617440","7617840"," Questionnaires."
"7618080","7619420"," We don't use all that kind of stuff."
"7619660","7623440"," So there's like another side, hold on to the positive side of this. "
"7624880","7626140"," So we'll see how that goes."
"7626300","7627520"," And I'll be honest with you."
"7627660","7630640"," At some point, some point, right?"
"7631420","7632620"," We can just take a private. "
"7632620","7634180"," We can just do the live stream private."
"7635380","7640160"," So if it comes down to doing a private live stream at this point with like 10 people or 100"
"7640160","7641540"," people, I'm down with that too."
"7642220","7643840"," I don't care if it's five people. "
"7644000","7646920"," I don't care if it's just Joe and I or whoever it is."
"7647300","7651720"," Or if we have recorded videos at nighttime and the stream is private, something like that we can do"
"7651720","7651900"," that."
"7652160","7652260"," So. "
"7654700","7656480"," Yeah, I don't care how we do it."
"7656600","7659420"," So one way or another, we're going to one way or another is going to get fixed."
"7666080","7667820"," Yeah, that's that I can't. "
"7667900","7669660"," This is here's the other wild part."
"7669820","7670780"," So there's like other shit here."
"7670800","7671500"," Like I gotta get out. "
"7671620","7672620"," You gotta like hear the dirty laundry."
"7673220","7676080"," You guys have to understand that you guys probably don't understand."
"7676300","7677460"," So I'm like sitting here with you. "
"7677520","7678680"," I'm going to trade right now, right?"
"7679740","7681900"," I got like a trade going on over here, right?"
"7682680","7685720"," I got like, uh, it's like someone playing music, right?"
"7685900","7690860"," You've got, um, we've got like a sound coming into my air."
"7690860","7692360"," They got to pay attention to."
"7692480","7695660"," I've got, uh, fucking new squawk going on in the background. "
"7696740","7699160"," And then I've got a chat that I'm trying to read."
"7699560","7700640"," And then of course there's requests."
"7700760","7702620"," And then I got to like, Hey, you want to get in the discord?"
"7702780","7705280"," Hey, you want to, you know, get free levels every day?"
"7705320","7706160"," Hey, you want to do this?"
"7706540","7710660"," And then of course I'm trying to like watch a bunch of other screens back here. "
"7711740","7716340"," To make sure that I'm doing everything that I need to do to do a stream for you guys."
"7716980","7721660"," So like, then all of a sudden you get thrown like a side, like a, like a boomerang question."
"7722000","7723820"," Like, Hey, Cap, you want to talk about this?"
"7724020","7725200"," Or hey, Cap, you want to talk about that?"
"7725260","7726540"," I'm like, you don't know the trade right now. "
"7726960","7730020"," Like I'm, I'm like, making sure that I'm making money here, right?"
"7731400","7738260"," Um, so the other, I guess the other option here would be, uh, talk to an old friend of mine"
"7738260","7747220"," that said, maybe I just go back to doing just swing trades and not day trade with you guys."
"7747780","7750280"," So there's that option too."
"7750460","7757440"," If I did that on live stream, I would be able to dedicate more time to what your needs are"
"7757440","7759460"," and not me trading as much. "
"7759720","7763200"," I would stop trading as much and just focus on what you guys are doing."
"7763200","7766360"," So there's another, there's another way we can do this."
"7766360","7769680"," There's some other, some other answers to this conundrum. "
"7769960","7772780"," So you guys aren't getting pissed in the chat."
"7773040","7774500"," You guys are like, Hey, you're not seeing this."
"7774500","7775420"," You're not seeing that. "
"7775480","7776220"," That kind of stuff."
"7776800","7781200"," And I'm not like, yeah, I'm not trying to get smoked in this, uh, zero dates today."
"7783220","7785120"," I'm still up right now by a couple pennies. "
"7785120","7786080"," So we'll see what happens."
"7787180","7789960"," Never took the money here looking to see if we can go higher here or not."
"7790160","7791500"," I don't want to see this break here. "
"7791980","7792860"," We start to break."
"7792860","7793620"," I'm gonna cut it loose."
"7796600","7799620"," I was making money up here, but I don't want to see this hold and go higher. "
"7802940","7804020"," Still long right now."
"7808990","7810350"," I'm watching this here in the background."
"7818940","7820220"," No money here, right?"
"7820720","7821260"," No money. "
"7826390","7829990"," Yeah, if I just do the swing trades, then I can focus on day traders."
"7830590","7834350"," That was the, that was the recommendation was maybe to stop day trading."
"7834350","7838830"," You can help other day traders because I don't really need to be day trading. "
"7838830","7841630"," I was like, I have like, make enough money."
"7841770","7844650"," I don't need to, um, need to necessarily be day trading."
"7845330","7846410"," So it's, it's a thought. "
"7846710","7847390"," Something to think about."
"7847550","7850930"," I haven't made a decision on it, but let's take a look at the five minute chart."

"8626910","8627810"," And it's one."
"8627870","8629770"," And I'm not going to wait for this in the end of the day. "
"8630230","8632770"," So I'm flat right now."
"8632850","8632990"," I'm out."
"8633150","8636070"," I think I lost 29 cents there. "
"8636110","8639290"," So I lost six pennies on that trade."
"8640010","8643650"," So I'll get with you guys again on Monday for the live stream."
"8644030","8647550"," I don't think I can leave this stream up for you. "
"8647670","8648530"," I didn't want to originally."
"8648530","8649370"," I just want to do the."
"8650330","8654250"," Do what to expect in the next week and what to expect in the correction. "

"8659250","8661790"," You see the expectation for the downside targets."
"8663130","8667730"," You see the expectation of the downside targets into and of quarter at 420. "
"8668370","8672410"," You also see that 432, 428 target is still there."
"8672930","8676690"," You see PMO P.A. PPOs not showing."
"8677710","8678750"," They were at bottom yet. "
"8678750","8686770"," You also see market breath had a liquidation trigger that was triggered at 30."
"8687230","8688630"," And then triggered at 20 as well."
"8689050","8694130"," We're trading 13.8, I think right now in market breath indicators. "
"8694610","8697910"," So can it have more down to go into next week?"
"8698150","8698430"," Absolutely."
"8698710","8699170"," I think so."
"8699690","8702750"," You know where we need to be for a bullish bias. "
"8702750","8706430"," You need price to get above that 443, 445."
"8707230","8712210"," And have hourly trick them up and support above the daily trigger until that happens."
"8712870","8715830"," There really isn't a bullish thesis. "
"8716090","8722470"," If anything bears want to be stepping in at that 443, 445 next week and sell it down into that."
"8722890","8724430"," 428, 426."
"8726710","8731170"," So I'm going to wrap this up with you and I will be back with you guys on Monday at"

"8743330","8743510"," No. "
"8743870","8744190"," Go in once."
"8744450","8744690"," Go in twice."
"8745250","8746330"," I can't see shit in the chat. "
"8746530","8748430"," So maybe I'm missing something here."
"8748630","8751430"," Let me go into the live stream and see."
"8751730","8753890"," I'm missing everything you guys are chatting and saying here. "
"8756470","8758790"," I think the chat's all fucked up on stream labs."
"8758970","8759250"," I don't know."
"8760330","8761230"," I'm just sorry. "
"8761490","8762310"," Beauty just said something."
