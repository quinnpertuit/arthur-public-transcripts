"70","2390"," Okay, we're back live again."
"2390","6430"," I don't know what, I don't know, like a denial of service attack."
"6730","11110"," I'm getting hammered by Russian porn bots or something like that. "
"12830","15030"," The old denial of service attack."
"18070","20230"," It's got to be some kind of something like that."
"21430","22390"," Well, here we go. "
"22470","23810"," Let's see who we have here in the background."
"24770","25950"," See who's rejoining us."
"27650","29030"," Okay, winky back with us. "
"32780","33620"," Think I've got."
"34140","34920"," No ours."
"35020","35880"," I think that's binky. "
"36680","37380"," Yeah, binky."
"38780","39500"," Captain here."
"39760","40400"," Yeah, I can hear. "
"41000","41720"," All right, good."
"41960","42780"," So you're with us again."
"43660","44100"," Yep. "
"45040","46020"," And we're good."
"46160","49980"," Let's see if we can get a winky back on here in just a minute."
"50260","51900"," It looks like people are rejoining us right now. "
"52160","53040"," It's really weird."
"55500","58780"," It's it's really weird to say I reset my router and modem this morning."
"58780","60200"," So no, it's nothing on my end. "
"60640","63200"," Unless there's maybe some understorms that I can't see."
"64720","66900"," I've got, I've got fiber internet."
"67280","73240"," So it could be stream labs too with the three of us at all at the same time for a"
"73240","74160"," extended period of time. "
"75060","79800"," Yeah, I think it may be, I think it may be stream labs because I wound up having to recycle"
"79800","81160"," my laptop again."
"81680","83720"," That's what everybody pile back in here again."
"84600","87500"," Oh, we still don't we still we still have lost winky. "
"88540","91700"," Winky might have just ran away and started eating hot dogs and hamburgers."
"92840","93500"," That's right."
"93720","94040"," That's right. "
"96110","98150"," So maybe I can get them on a phone call."
"98310","99430"," Maybe that's what I'm going to have to do."
"102170","108490"," Is like run it from a phone or something when we have like I'm on your show or something like"
"108490","108930"," that or. "
"110790","114990"," Let me see if I can just call winky and get these tickers from him."
"116530","120810"," I can like port him or you into like Bluetooth speaker."
"123430","132820"," Yeah, well, Cap is working on that one comment that he made it started the show is that you kind"
"132820","139860"," of need to recalibrate your thought process because the timing on using the triggers this way is a"
"139860","140320"," little bit longer. "
"140320","146980"," Turn right we're not looking for quick term day trades here and the value of this especially the"
"146980","152540"," guys like me is thinking about it in terms of hours and days allows you to kind of flesh out"
"152540","154180"," the way that you view the market."
"154220","160620"," And that's actually the power of having a different focus on the show and the stream is that allows"
"160620","166160"," us all to take a breath and view a little bit longer term with each one of these tickers."
"166160","169300"," And again, market conditions can change. "
"170040","171580"," There could be a bad news on Taiwan."
"172540","179340"," And all of the price targets that cap has gone through could change immediately based on that."
"179560","186300"," But this at least gives you some context that's got some depth behind it on what that current"
"186300","192680"," market assessment is really appreciate everybody joining the stream and supporting it. "
"192680","198260"," And we've actually got a lot more folks in the stream today than I expected because I thought"
"198260","204560"," everybody would be doing Father's Day stuff early and want to respect everybody's time but do"
"204560","205540"," appreciate the support."
"206420","213580"," And there is definitely going to be a lot of momentum around the trade the trigger website."
"214780","220100"," Keeping that a little bit close to the vest at this point, but as the team in the background is"
"220100","220560"," getting that. "
"221600","224360"," It's going to be really exciting over the next few weeks."
"229710","230670"," No losing cap."
"235420","236400"," Hey, can you hear me?"
"236420","241260"," Yeah, I can hear you just trying to get winky on here. "
"241360","242220"," Yes, no problem."
"243200","244960"," Hey, I want to make that out there."
"245100","246900"," John Klopp, brother, how you doing, man. "
"249040","251360"," Hey, you know, John, I got to tell you something, dude."
"251700","254140"," So like Thursday or no."
"254500","257540"," So I forgot like on. "
"259519","260459"," Hold on here."
"260540","260899"," I got to get."
"261560","262680"," I got to get winky on. "
"263140","263760"," I'm on."
"264420","264620"," Sweet."
"265600","266240"," I hear. "
"266960","269220"," Dude, I don't know what any of you guys out there."
"269300","273240"," But let me ask winky and for you through the rest of these tickers by request."
"273240","280580"," So I forgot like when I came into the last week at like Monday, Tuesday, the week before was so"
"280580","284920"," crazy that by Tuesday, I was like, feels like a fucking Friday. "
"285540","289020"," Buddy, let me tell you, I was texting you from vacation."
"289180","293680"," And I think I said, I thought this week was off X."
"294480","297500"," Like that whole week, like a week early, I thought it was like."
"298680","301520"," Six, eight and not six, 16 or whatever. "
"301780","302640"," I was like, what's the."
"302980","304860"," It was so fast that week."
"304880","305340"," You're right. "
"305540","305800"," Exactly."
"306020","306520"," 100%."
"307120","308260"," I'm in the same boat. "
"308260","311240"," And then, you know, we were texting different times and."
"311900","315240"," I know you were trading futures and it was when I said George and."
"316080","319420"," Yeah, you were trading futures and it was a grinder. "
"320300","320920"," It was."
"321500","324180"," So I, so then like Wednesday, Thursday, I forgot."
"324420","328140"," So Thursday after the show, I was hanging out with croissant off stream. "
"328660","329720"," And I lost my voice."
"330220","330500"," It was gone."
"331080","334160"," I was like, I didn't realize they've been screaming every day because. "
"334740","336560"," Every day was something insane, right?"
"337000","337680"," Every day is like."
"338060","338620"," That's right."
"339560","342980"," I mean, how many times can you scream that we're going up like?"
"343520","343920"," I don't know. "
"344200","344460"," Like so."
"345780","346260"," Yeah."
"346260","347080"," It's crazy. "
"347120","348060"," It was nuts, man."
"348080","348900"," It was so fast."
"349600","350500"," Wasn't the same, right?"
"350940","351180"," Yeah. "
"352240","353040"," And then."
"354140","355960"," Killer weak in the discord too, man."
"356100","357660"," The moderators are doing a great job again. "
"357920","361720"," And tell him PayPal and we can blow this thing up and go have a barbecue."
"362180","362520"," Okay."
"362800","363360"," So I'm going to go through. "
"363600","365040"," I'm going to do a lightning round here."
"366540","367640"," I'm going to do it."
"367900","369400"," Is Bitcoin going up right now?"
"369420","370580"," Anybody let me know in the chat?"
"370740","372160"," Is Bitcoin going up right now?"
"372160","373440"," I mean, it's trying. "
"373900","377860"," I wouldn't I wouldn't buy it like until it actually gets above."
"378320","383420"," But like it looked at the level that you pointed out was like where it's fighting for."
"383660","384020"," So yeah. "
"384420","384880"," Yeah."
"385140","386200"," So this is being recorded."
"387120","391160"," We will try at some point to list every ticker that we go through. "
"391520","394460"," I'm going to apologize to you guys out there right now."
"394840","398860"," I will be here on Tuesday morning and I will review."
"399920","401040"," All of the. "
"402880","408380"," If I can do something later tonight or tomorrow, I'll try to get on stream and just hammer out all"
"408380","410140"," the buy zones for the portfolio."
"410480","413900"," Do you guys really want me to hammer those out at the end of this show?"
"413980","415520"," I could probably lightning around that too."
"416100","416540"," We could just. "
"416800","422240"," Do you guess if you feel like they're not going to go ahead and do it and then that way"
"422240","422560"," you can."
"423560","424080"," Do it."
"424760","425800"," We're going to do it live. "
"429200","434460"," I would just say we should probably go over my head like those guys do the other two first."
"434520","434920"," Yeah."
"436080","436860"," Here's my pen. "
"437000","439440"," I'm going to throw it over my head like they used to do on Saturday live."
"439640","439800"," Okay."
"441720","442120"," Twilio. "
"443400","444460"," Would like to buy."
"444800","448500"," Ultimately, we'd like to buy about $63, possibly $60."
"449260","451860"," This is consolidation right now in Twilio. "
"452080","454520"," It can remain irrational."
"455560","457140"," Longer than you can stay solvent."
"458140","461840"," A break below $60 and I've become bearish on it. "
"462260","462260"," Okay."
"462740","463880"," Break below like that."
"464160","464220"," Boom. "
"464380","465200"," We start heading lower."
"465460","470900"," Otherwise, it's the name of the game here is to take this trade to the upside on."
"472200","473320"," On Twilio. "
"474140","475140"," Next one."
"476760","477400"," CRM."
"478160","480600"," Lot of lot of questions about CRM. "
"480660","482820"," We're going to make this one quick as well."
"483240","484360"," Trading $218."
"485340","485980"," Right. "
"486280","489340"," Got some nice smashing moves on Twilio over here."
"490060","491460"," We're going to remove five drawings."
"492420","495820"," It's just grinding up into the right here. "
"496900","498780"," I am a buyer on Twilio."
"498920","500320"," Believe it or not."
"500320","501520"," Is that CRM?"
"501760","502660"," That might be CRM. "
"502840","503020"," My bad."
"503220","503620"," I said Twilio."
"504620","505080"," My bad. "
"505420","507780"," I am a buyer on Twilio at $190."
"509880","511320"," $190 on CRM."
"512020","516620"," If you're already in this trade, you should have already taken profit above a $231. "
"518220","518780"," Okay."
"519059","524900"," So I'm still looking for if you're looking for an entry on it right now, I understand you wanting"
"524900","530580"," to buy 2.0863. But I think you've got a lot of consolidation in here."
"530820","530960"," Okay. "
"531480","537920"," I would love to see like one quick dip down here and then join you on your track on 2 "
"537920","544040",".0863. So if there's any kind of like market weakness in here that I can join you with, I will."
"544740","551200"," But if not, if you're already long on CRM, just keep buying the dip on 2.08. Keep trying to"
"551200","555980"," attack 2.30. 1.21. It looks a little long on the tooth right now."
"555980","556900"," I'm not going to lie to you. "
"557200","561720"," If there's a tech rotation, you might get stuck in that."
"562140","565020"," But ultimately, I know what you're looking for on CRM."
"566500","567600"," And you see it right here. "
"567680","568580"," I want to show it to you right here."
"568640","569520"," This is CRM, right?"
"570960","572660"," You know, this happens, right?"
"573380","575440"," You're like a rocket scientist out there."
"575440","579440"," You think everything's going up and then, bam, there's that one quick move down. "
"580160","582680"," And there's your actual explosive move, right?"
"583360","584420"," Whiplash right there."
"584940","587700"," Daily catches you on the downside of bam."
"587900","589280"," You're now to the upside. "
"589920","592560"," Trying to take out some of these previous size of 260."
"593520","595600"," Trying to take out this 300, 290."
"596140","597200"," This could take some time. "
"597300","597580"," Look at that."
"598180","599880"," That's November right there, right?"
"600560","601900"," That happens to you."
"602800","604500"," You could get caught, right?"
"604840","605580"," And more consolidation. "
"606580","609520"," I'm not going to say you're going to get caught in this consolidation."
"609520","614200"," The consolidation down here, what I'm going to say to you on CRM is trade the levels."
"617120","624240"," So if you wanted to long this on some weakness this week down here at 205, keep trading this"
"624240","625420"," higher, right?"
"625760","629280"," Some kind of moves like this into October, right?"
"629500","634720"," You can kind of like start to see that trade unfold over time for CRM. "
"634980","638860"," So just keep buying trend, the daily trend, all the way up in CRM."
"638860","641280"," I'm kind of a cheap person, right?"
"641540","645420"," I always want that one moment where I can jump in on the run."
"645700","646600"," I might not get that. "
"646880","652580"," So right now, dip buyers are sitting on 208, 63, 231, 21."
"653420","657940"," I am bullish, ultimately on CRM on Salesforce to come back here and test all this stuff."
"658540","666400"," If we do trade underneath $190 and begin to reject, the trade is over and we are going to get"
"666400","668700"," some new lows again on it. "
"668700","670800"," So basically you have to hold $190."
"672300","677020"," This is the number that I'm trying to buy down here right now on CRM, any kind of market weakness."
"677860","680560"," Do not for a minute think that we don't get it. "
"680960","682580"," I'm going to warn you guys of something out there."
"683580","687680"," You guys out there are going to think that we'll never come back down and see this number down"
"687680","687920"," here."
"688600","694820"," I assure you that even in strong bull markets, there will always be an opportunity for you to come"
"694820","699940"," back down, test this stuff, come back down, test this stuff and try to run this up. "
"700580","706480"," So for me right now, where we are for next week, window of weakness, I'm trying to buy 190 bucks."
"707160","709640"," But I am ultimately still bullish on CRM."
"709840","711140"," Next one, PLTR. "
"715700","717860"," Boom, explosive move on PLTR."
"718100","719260"," That's the move, right?"
"721340","722980"," What do I want to buy on this one?"
"723240","724220"," I'm going to show you right now."
"724220","729680"," So PLTR, I want to be buying $15 on PLTR. "
"730140","736220"," The juicy trade on PLTR is likely going to be where we are right now, 10 bucks."
"737160","741860"," Yeah, right around 10 bucks, like some kind of like panic moment on Palantir."
"742780","745520"," I am ultimately they'll bullish on it. "
"746080","752300"," I want to see where above the monthly, we've got the daily racing up, the weekly racing up."
"752300","753660"," This thing might just keep going higher."
"754340","763560"," You might be lucky to grab 13 bucks, or excuse me, $15, maybe $13.76. You might be lucky on"
"763560","764000"," that trade. "
"765080","766700"," Ultimately, we're looking for that $27."
"767180","769180"," We're looking for all these highs up here."
"769940","773960"," You're going to expect some sellers at these levels that I pop in right here. "
"773960","782380"," We got this one right here, $17.96, and then you've got right down there."
"785020","788240"," Right here, you got another one right there too."
"790560","792300"," Just level level trading on it. "
"792480","793860"," I am bullish on it right now."
"794640","798020"," I always like though, like that one moment, like four o'clock in the morning."
"798580","799520"," Put a stink bit in. "
"800340","806120"," Four AM comes in right down there briefly, right back into consolidation."
"807260","807960"," Excuse me."
"808260","808960"," There's the daily. "
"809580","810260"," There's the monthly."
"810900","813640"," Bam, bam, bam, bam, and just start ripping to the upside."
"814200","814260"," Bam. "
"815200","815800"," Ripping to the upside."
"816220","816340"," Bam."
"817660","819180"," Start taking out these highs. "
"819580","820840"," Extremely bullish on Palantir."
"821260","831120"," If you're looking for your dip buy, your DCA buy, basically you're trying to buy $14.21. DCA"
"831120","834780"," into $10 and just buy and hold."
"835360","835900"," Leaps. "
"836040","836860"," I don't care what you do."
"837360","842980"," The trade is dead with a rejection below $10.13 on Palantir."
"843320","844180"," Next one. "
"844520","844940"," Intel."
"847080","848540"," I am TLT."
"848720","849880"," I don't know, man. "
"850060","852000"," If you're looking at all this stuff out here."
"854640","856220"," Northern Lights, baby."
"857460","858420"," Northern Lights. "
"859380","860340"," I'll give you some."
"860520","862520"," I'm going to give you some some respect here."
"862720","863660"," Sorry, sorry, sorry. "
"863840","864560"," I think you're looking at."
"864680","865340"," I N T C."
"867840","868100"," I apologize."
"868660","869580"," Sorry about that ticker. "
"869640","870460"," Looking at that right now."
"871300","872240"," I N T C."
"872400","873860"," We called this trade out."
"874840","875880"," Months ago. "
"877740","879240"," We called it out because."
"880220","881640"," We called it out because."
"882460","884100"," We said that. "
"884640","888740"," All the premium kick made N VDA expensive."
"889480","893440"," Trade that nobody was interested in was I N T C."
"893780","894120"," And so."
"895320","897020"," We even said. "
"898060","902220"," To look at leaps and not, you know, three month, six month."
"902680","903580"," Year out contracts."
