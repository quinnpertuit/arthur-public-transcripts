"260","4900"," I keep running stuff in the background and I have to turn this stuff off, so I'm going to start,"
"5220","12060"," I'm going to turn some of this stuff off here in the background and we'll come back to it so"
"12060","15140"," that you so that we're not killing the stream here with the data pool."
"16740","19420"," Let me see, turn some of this off some of that off."
"20320","22080"," This should help the stream speed up. "
"22080","29080"," I was just telling Twitter podcast that there's a fair chance one of my daughters is upstairs"
"29080","33540"," playing like Xbox on like 1080p or something."
"33820","40760"," I probably shouldn't say that, but we're back again though I apologize for you guys out there."
"40820","45580"," We're trying this new format here and we're running into some walls as we do it. "
"46860","48780"," All right, so continue on again, Twitter podcast."
"49320","52540"," No, I had a question."
"52780","54180"," I think it was from C tax. "
"56320","57780"," I'm sorry if I'm getting that name wrong."
"57940","60880"," I'm trying to find that question again, but I was asked for a downside target."
"61260","62500"," So the downside target. "
"63220","68980"," If we just go by the overlay is, you know, so we're going to be at about 123% extension."
"69920","70920"," That's where this is."
"71200","74180"," And then this is about 116. "
"75980","84840"," So, let's let's start 123 123 to 16 so 7% correction in like four or five days."
"86540","89500"," So say that again for people so they can hear you."
"90040","93460"," Okay, so I was asked like what my downside target would be. "
"93620","98820"," So I'm like looking at this overlay to kind of guide me is that after the spot four to five"
"98820","99780"," percent push higher."
"100540","101620"," Yes, that's right."
"101780","105640"," So you'd break slim back down into 5000 possibly go a little bit lower right. "
"106200","113040"," Possibly a little bit lower and around 4900 450 maybe, but you know, like as we get closer to the"
"113040","113240"," day."
"113820","118860"," These things, because I run this every night, it like scans and changes and you know, adjust"
"118860","121980"," everything and like does the overlay like at the end of every night."
"122840","123940"," After every trading day. "
"124380","128699"," So, you know, we'll get a better indication of what the target but right now like everything, even"
"128699","134400"," by the way, after that happens, that's another dip to buy for like the next 20 trading days."
"134400","140620"," And then we chop down and then we go up, you know, which is kind of expected to."
"140960","144800"," And the reason why I'm saying this is what that's kind of expected because you think about what's"
"144800","153040"," happening on the economy side on the macro side macro does not impact your day to day but it does"
"153040","154360"," impact trends to a little bit. "
"154360","160500"," So I don't really care about macro but the fact is that we have some stuff and some hangover to"
"160500","162100"," take care of plus we have an election year."
"162520","164900"," So I would not expect."
"165460","174480"," So I would expect like a slam down, get bought back up and then kind of like chop to words"
"174480","178440"," like July in all honesty. "
"178440","185380"," And so July 1st half of July, I would just long and cute is what my plan is going to"
"185380","190840"," be is just buy the cues and just like sit on it for a while."
"192520","198440"," So, anyways, that's kind of all the stuff I had like kind of wanted to talk about."
"198980","203580"," Now that I'm going to be in the discord, I am going to, you know, at the end of every"
"203580","205620"," day when I generate these all drop these in there. "
"205880","208440"," I'll probably work on some formatting to make these better."
"209080","213300"," Yeah, we'll talk about what I can do to is get you a page if you want to the website"
"213300","215360"," in a room for discussion."
"215780","218140"," So people have questions for you and stuff like that. "
"218440","221460"," But yeah, we'll set something up for you to make it nice."
"221460","227040"," So it's not discord is good for a lot of stuff, but it's it's kind of like data drop."
"227260","230280"," So they just kept rolled up into the chat and stuff like that. "
"230320","233320"," So like warehousing that stuff is sometimes better on a website."
"233380","240240"," So I was talking to Bork about getting you a author invite to the website stuff like that."
"240340","242360"," We'll talk about all the other stuff along"
"242360","251440"," with that. "
"251440","254300"," Before we go, I think we're going to take a break here and watch the market."
"254600","256160"," Looks like we're at some fair resistance."
"256620","260500"," So it might be a place for us to take a break and a quick breather. "
"261180","264520"," So first off, I want you to follow at trader podcast."
"265180","270400"," It's t-r-a-d-e-r-p-o-d-c-a-s-t-e on Twitter."
"271340","274100"," Also, what was your handle again on Wall Street?"
"274280","275060"," That's around Reddit. "
"275280","275920"," What's your handle there?"
"276540","279160"," The zones trade the zones."
"279760","282280"," Find him and follow him on Reddit as well."
"282920","285520"," I don't really post a lot other than in my private subreddit. "
"286220","288480"," You know, it's other than a private subreddit."
"288480","291340"," It's not my private subreddit, but you know, that's where I usually hang out."
"292060","294240"," But Twitter is the best place to get ahold of me. "
"294340","298060"," Or once I'm in caps discord, you know, ping me."
"298200","300220"," I'm usually like very responsive."
"300680","302300"," If it's a question, I can answer. "
"302480","304180"," If it's not, you know, I'll tell you."
"304400","307420"," Or if it's something that I need time to answer, I'll tell you that too."
"307900","309340"," But anyways, thank you so much, Cap. "
"309520","310540"," Thanks for having me on that."
"310560","312180"," Hey, I appreciate having you on, brother, today."
"312460","314160"," People love that club scene you come on the show. "
"314220","315740"," So I'm really grateful that you're here."
"316620","321140"," I will get back with you trader podcast today in the next hour or two."
"321420","322540"," I'll be able to chat with you after here. "
"322580","323200"," I'll take a quick break."
"324080","325860"," And we'll do some catch up really quick."
"326780","328380"," People are thanking you to be here today. "
"328380","330220"," I appreciate you being here today as well."
"330620","332980"," And head back over now."
"333220","335020"," And this I'm going to end the call with you trader podcast. "
"335320","336400"," I'll give you a shout in just a moment."
"336920","338080"," Thanks for showing up, brother."
"338140","338640"," You want to say goodbye?"
"339720","341300"," Yeah, thank you for having me again. "
"341360","343600"," And before I leave, I just want you to see."
"344920","347480"," They're bidding the shit out of SPX right now."
"347560","348140"," Look at all that. "
"348240","349440"," Yeah, that gets rolled in."
"349660","352220"," So it's it's very sweet season fellas."
"353240","355280"," And that kind of goes with what I would. "
"355280","357540"," I would have expected because this is last night."
"357720","365360"," I would have expected the long the long ramp to begin today right now."
"365600","367240"," Right now the big ramp is today. "
"367680","371600"," You get live and straight from trader podcast that we're going straight to the moon."
"372220","373940"," I will talk to you guys in a bit."
"374060","376960"," I'm going to put you guys back on the main of the main screen. "
"377880","379040"," And take a quick break."
"379560","381560"," You guys have a discussion inside of the comments."
"382860","383840"," Thanks for your podcast. "
"383840","385300"," Yeah, my pleasure, man."
"385480","385720"," All right."
"389920","391680"," And the call for everyone. "
"393760","394740"," Here we go."
"394960","395120"," So."
"396180","398280"," Let me see if I can bring this stuff over. "
"399500","402680"," And we've got trader pad podcast saying that."
"403040","408000"," Today is the beginning of the ramp before the correction begins."
"408840","414340"," So if you pop that towards the end today, the expectation here is that we're going to go way"
"414340","414840"," higher. "
"414840","416700"," This is just the beginning today."
"417640","420360"," Hold on one second here right up there."
"424170","426410"," I just got kicked off Twitter too. "
"427290","429710"," Twitter is like you have a suspicious login."
"429930","430750"," We're going to kick you off."
"431710","433890"," So I just got booted off Twitter. "
"441980","443260"," Hold on one second here."
"468330","470010"," Let's keep on squeezing smooth."
"470270","472350"," They got to do some work here in the background for you guys. "
"473350","474870"," I'm going to bring this down."
"475130","479910"," Looks like trader podcast is joining us in the stream right now or in the chat right now."
"481470","485910"," So we'll make this bigger for you so you can see him chatting with the group. "
"488590","489750"," We move that over."
"489750","492570"," I think that works over there just like that right."
"493410","495570"," So you guys can see the chat at home. "
"496130","502950"," Now before I go, I deleted a bunch of instances of trading view down here."
"503690","504430"," If you have any."
"504610","506710"," I've got IWM up right now. "
"506930","508970"," I'm going to add some more here."
"510990","513610"," I'm going to do the cues here for you."
"517690","519049"," So I'm going to do QQQ. "
"522950","523810"," Wait a minute."
"523970","524290"," Hold on a second."
"524450","525290"," This is Apple I guess. "
"525730","527070"," I'm still having issues here."
"531870","533690"," We turn this off back here."
"533810","535370"," I'm still having some issues here. "
"538770","540070"," So here's Apple."
"540870","542990"," Trying to reload this one for you right now."
"553400","555160"," Yeah, I'm still having issues here. "
"555580","556060"," Here we go."
"556060","557160"," We're coming back right now, I guess."
"565440","567260"," Am I losing the show again?"
"567660","568180"," Are you fucking?"
"568520","570340"," Am I losing the show again?"
"571820","572900"," It doesn't look like I am. "
"575060","576560"," Looks like we're still up and running."
"578500","580340"," I'm like are we losing the show again?"
"582160","582840"," Here we go."
"582920","584480"," Apple's back up and running again. "
"584600","585520"," We're good to go on this one."
"585960","587860"," And let's see here."
"588800","589840"," It puts SPX up. "
"590960","593800"," Here's SPX in a 30 minute chart down below for you."
"597440","598320"," There's IWM."
"600260","604060"," IWM dude looking like it wants to go back up there and trade 205 again. "
"605280","610180"," There's SPX for you in the 30 minute trying to once again attack 5100."
"610720","615340"," And blow this up for you again."
"615500","618820"," A little bit of range bound action here on SPX. "
"621880","622880"," Stream is good now."
"623000","626500"," I just started killing a bunch of action stuff in the background."
"628020","629320"," I'm going to go check. "
"629540","633140"," I'm going to go walk around my house and make sure that I don't make sure I don't have people"
"633140","634340"," playing on stuff."
"635580","636740"," Hold on one second here."
"637120","638520"," I'm going to take a quick break and just check. "
"641500","641900"," NVDA."
"643060","643860"," That's eBay."
"644240","644920"," We already had that one. "
"645040","648080"," So we got Apple, IWM, SPX."
"648360","650680"," We're going to do NVDA for you."
"651560","652980"," So you guys love that ticker. "
"656120","657560"," Put this on a one minute."
"664440","666080"," Squeeze above the hourly trigger."
"666420","667620"," Came back down and confirmed. "
"668780","671760"," NVDA with a nice confirmation on the hourly trigger down here."
"675320","680080"," Can you guys make a comment on the stream if everything is okay?"
"680520","681040"," Hey, Recarving."
"681160","681200"," Bear. "
"681680","682220"," How are you?"
"683020","683700"," All right."
"683820","687500"," I'm going to take a quick break here and I'll be back with you guys in about 15 minutes."
"688600","689840"," About 15 minutes. "
"689840","691560"," I got a little more thing I got to do here."
"693180","698080"," Pull that down over there and I'll be right back with you guys."
"715350","721930"," Increase in nearly three years, but pending sales for that period dropped 8%. "
"721930","724450"," So there's your mortgage rate effect, Dom."
"724450","732290"," Diana, there's been some anecdotal reporting done with regard to certain of those so-called past"
"732290","739030"," and current hot real estate markets, places like Arizona, places like Florida, where there are"
"739030","742670"," stories about an uptick in the number of listings that people are starting to see."
"743250","747430"," That's not official data, but just residents and real estate brokers in the area. "
"747950","752970"," Do you think that there is an unlocking for the spring season coming that people are ready to put"
"752970","755670"," their market if mortgage rates cooperate?"
"756650","760370"," Well, there's a slight unlocking only because, you know, we're coming up on March and that is the"
"760370","763310"," all-important spring market and that's when people list their homes for sale."
"763490","765330"," So we see that seasonally every year."
"765930","770590"," We still need a lot more homes on the market and we're not going to see the kind of inventory"
"770590","772310"," uptick that we really need. "
"772650","777570"," We've seen this increase, but when you're coming off of these record low inventory levels, you have"
"777570","783750"," to give a lot more than that in order to have a robust selling season and a lot of people"
"783750","785470"," with mortgage rates in the 7% range."
"785470","787750"," Now it's going to be harder for me to get a buyer."
"787950","793310"," Am I going to have to give incentives by down their mortgage rate, et cetera, in order to get a"
"793310","798430"," buyer or on the other side, do I want to sell my house when 7% is out there and"
"798430","802310"," I need to buy another house at that rate and I've got two and a half percent from a couple"
"802310","802810"," of years ago. "
"803130","807250"," So there's a lot holding today's seller back, but it is the spring."
"807490","810290"," So you will see some houses come on the market everywhere."
"810290","813010"," If you're not in love with your house, you're in love with your mortgage. "
"813390","814570"," Dinole, thank you very much."
"814670","815350"," We'll talk to you later on."
"815590","819750"," Coming up on the show, Morgan Stanley is getting more bullish on one area of commercial real"
"819750","821870"," estate, which supply can't keep up with demand. "
"822630","824490"," And no, it's not tied to artificial intelligence."
"825410","828250"," The sector and their top picks coming up next plus."
"829010","831050"," Titleists parent company, Akushnet. "
"831430","836330"," Not seeing much green today on weaker than expected results, but the stock's coming off its best"
"836330","838450"," year since the start of the pandemic."
"838450","842910"," And we've got a rare and exclusive interview with the Kushnet CEO coming up."
"843110","844550"," The exchange is back after this. "
"847190","850470"," This is the exchange on CNBC."
"1003530","1004310"," Oh, try."
"1007210","1008570"," Welcome back to the exchange. "
"1009230","1014490"," While the office sector has been hit hard, our next guest says that keep in mind that's only a"
"1014490","1017050"," small part of the real estate investment trust sector."
"1017090","1022470"," She sees big opportunities elsewhere, and she's here with the trends and the trades and where she's"
"1022470","1023990"," seen some of the biggest upside potential."
"1024690","1029250"," So joining me now for more on this is Laurel Durkey, the head of global listed real estate assets,"
"1029470","1031609"," real assets at Morgan Stanley investment management. "
"1032589","1034470"," Laurel, real is a lot."
"1034710","1039310"," There's a lot of stuff that constitutes real assets, but the one people most identify with is real"
"1039310","1041609"," estate is the land, the buildings and everything else."
"1041609","1044810"," Let's talk a little bit about where those opportunities are. "
"1044950","1049210"," We just spent a whole segment or two talking about rates and their impact on places like"
"1049210","1049550"," residential."
"1050150","1052850"," What does it mean for the overall commercial side of things?"
"1053170","1059730"," Obviously, interest rates are going to have a significant impact on all of real estate commercial"
"1059730","1060630"," and residential."
"1061350","1066950"," What I'm seeing is that the interest rate environment and volatility in the interest rate"
"1066950","1072150"," environment has really been impacting the pricing of these stocks. "
"1072590","1078290"," But when you look at the fundamentals, the fundamentals in a lot of the sectors that I'm investing"
"1078290","1080650"," in remain very strong."
"1080830","1081930"," And that's where I'm excited."
"1082490","1084570"," Interest rates, I cannot control. "
"1085090","1090730"," And I think there is a growing consensus around the fact that we absolutely will see rate cuts at"
"1090730","1091950"," the latter half of this year."
"1091950","1097870"," The fundamentals is what I'm focused on and where I believe we can differentiate and really add"
"1097870","1098150"," alpha."
"1098310","1104690"," Outside of your primary residence, people are maybe a little bit scared, maybe apprehensions to go"
"1104690","1109930"," into real estate, whether at the multi-family industrial type level, commercial level warehouse,"
"1110470","1114610"," where exactly is the opportunity right now, given the fact that rates are maybe a little uncertain. "
"1115250","1121570"," So the underlying sectoral composition of the listed real estate universe is a lot larger than just"
"1121570","1123750"," the traditional that you would think of."
"1123750","1124950"," It's not just office."
"1125190","1126430"," It's not just multi-family. "
"1126930","1130710"," So what I'm excited about is in some of the alternative sectors."
"1130970","1137890"," And the alternative sectors really are inclusive of data centers and health care real estate and"
"1137890","1144450"," cell towers and cell storage and some of these areas of real estate that have secular drivers of"
"1144450","1144810"," demand."
"1145390","1152050"," What's interesting about that is they have already been some of the outperformers so far when it"
"1152050","1152870"," comes to real estate. "
"1153130","1158290"," You're talking about office complexes that are owned by REITs that specialize in laboratory and"
"1158290","1160110"," factory type facilities for health care."
"1160250","1165110"," You're talking about maybe even senior living, where exactly, what kind of stocks are there picks"
"1165110","1166130"," that you like more than others."
"1166490","1169350"," So I think focusing specifically on health care. "
"1170090","1177910"," The seniors housing sector is an area that has a significant amount of demand that is manifesting"
"1177910","1179270"," itself as we speak."
"1179750","1184970"," When you take a step back and think about aging demographics within this country, baby boomers"
"1184970","1188110"," right now are aged between 60 and 78."
"1188830","1194690"," They are approaching the prime age to move into seniors housing facilities. "
"1195730","1203370"," So a name that really plays into this aging demographic theme is Well Tower ticker WEL."
"1203890","1207350"," By the way, Laurel, just hold that thought because by the way that was our mystery chart."
"1207470","1209670"," If you're wondering, we kind of showed you that mystery chart. "
"1210030","1210770"," It is Well Tower."
"1210930","1214510"," And by the way, the senior housing thing is something we've talked about quite a bit"
"1214510","1215970"," demographically trend wise."
"1216630","1217990"," You mentioned that timeline. "
"1218730","1224250"," Is that going to cause an even bigger jump in your mind over the next few years in the stock"
"1224250","1224770"," values?"
"1225070","1225430"," Absolutely."
"1225850","1226090"," Absolutely."
"1226410","1232590"," So when you think about the aging demographic over the last decade, the 80 plus year old age cohort"
"1232590","1235210"," grew at about one and a half percent. "
"1235510","1238390"," There were two million additional people added to that age cohort."
"1239050","1240410"," Look at the next decade."
"1240770","1242690"," It's growing at about four and a half percent. "
"1242910","1244890"," That's eight million more people."
"1245270","1247690"," So that demand is continuing to grow."
"1248250","1252870"," 2027 is a year that is really going to see the most amount of explosive growth. "
"1252870","1259010"," We're at a point in time when new supply into the seniors housing space is actually decelerating."
"1259770","1264670"," And so we have the supply demand imbalance that all real estate investors love."
"1265130","1270810"," Because what that means is that you will see growth and you will see continued cash flow"
"1270810","1272970"," appreciation and therefore value appreciation. "
"1273630","1278670"," Now, there's also on that same health care kind of aging demographic side."
"1278670","1285690"," There are also real estate investment trusts that specialize in laboratory type facilities, owning"
"1285690","1286970"," those commercial type facilities."
"1287430","1292250"," Is health care thematically besides just seniors going to be something, drug companies,"
"1292430","1294950"," pharmaceutical companies and the facilities they need?"
"1295450","1303050"," So we do have life sciences which do own labs as part of the real estate universe. "
"1303050","1310510"," At the coincident point in time what you're seeing is that lab space have a significant oversupply."
"1310890","1313910"," And so there is a bit of a different dynamic going on."
"1314090","1319950"," The underlying need obviously for lab and life science space is going to continue to grow. "
"1320190","1324030"," And over the long term I think is a favorable area to be in."
"1324210","1328050"," But at the current time is not something that I'm super excited about."
"1328050","1335050"," However, when you look for example in the skilled nursing area rehab area which is more short term"
"1335050","1336830"," stays for seniors. "
"1337250","1343550"," That's an area that I think is going to continue to have really robust fundamentals at its back and"
"1343550","1345330"," have that supply demand imbalance."
"1345690","1350050"," And because we have an expert like you here I don't want to let you go without talking a little"
"1350050","1351230"," bit about residential housing."
"1351590","1351770"," Okay. "
"1351910","1353670"," The housing shortage in America right now."
"1353670","1359810"," Is there anything market wise that can happen where people can position themselves for an outcome"
"1359810","1362110"," one way or the other given the housing shortage in America?"
"1362650","1365750"," So housing shortages and affordability is absolutely a problem."
"1365950","1370350"," We are at multi-decade lows when it comes to affordability. "
"1371030","1377650"," A way in which I think you can benefit from that from an investment perspective is investing within"
"1377650","1379270"," single family rentals."
"1380310","1386550"," So this is an area that has been institutionalized over really the past decade coming out of the"
"1386550","1387750"," global financial crisis."
"1388230","1394470"," And you have a company like AMH which was formerly known as American homes for rent and now is just"
"1394470","1404010"," called AMH which is really benefiting from the need for Americans to have an affordable place to"
"1404010","1404310"," live. "
"1404950","1410070"," And the cash flow growth that you're seeing out of this company really is very extreme."
"1410370","1410630"," All right."
"1410930","1412470"," So all different parts of real estate covered. "
"1412910","1413630"," Laurel Durkey."
"1413890","1414910"," Thank you so much for being here."
"1414990","1415550"," We'll see you again soon. "
"1415710","1416330"," Thanks for having me."
"1416430","1416630"," All right."
"1416890","1417730"," Well coming up on the show. "
"1418190","1422770"," Open AI and Sam Altman are back in the spotlight after reportedly coming under scrutiny from the"
"1422770","1422930"," SEC."
"1423890","1425050"," We've got those details ahead."
"1425210","1426290"," The exchange is back after this. "
"1597190","1601450"," Welcome back to the exchange to hack into change health care."
"1601630","1606090"," The Texas City area of the United Health Group continues to disrupt hospitals and pharmacies across"
"1606090","1606670"," the country."
"1606870","1611670"," The health department reportedly working with UNH to assess the impact on patient care as well. "
"1612230","1616770"," And this as we're getting new numbers looking at the cost of ransomware attacks in the past year."
"1617290","1619090"," Our own Aiman Jabbers has those details."
"1619970","1621050"," Hey there, Dom. "
"1621230","1626050"," Ransomware has come roaring back in the volume of ransom payments to criminals from hacking"
"1626050","1626510"," victims."
"1626810","1631510"," Set a new record in 2023 surpassing $1 billion for the first time."
"1631630","1636530"," Take a look at this chart from blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, which just put out their"
"1636530","1638630"," annual report on crypto crime today. "
"1639090","1646090"," You see a dramatic drop in ransomware payments there from criminals from 2021 to 2022, which"
"1646090","1650690"," experts say is largely attributable to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, which disrupted criminal"
"1650690","1653230"," hacking gangs operating in both countries."
"1653410","1658430"," But then at the right-hand side of the chart in 2023, the payments rocketed back up to a new"
"1658430","1666110"," high of $1.1 billion, which Chainalysis says is due to a large influx of new players into the"
"1666110","1666370"," space."
"1666770","1670610"," Other analysts have also suggested that the Russians and Ukrainians have been able to regroup"
"1670610","1673370"," themselves a little bit since the early days of the war. "
"1673370","1679630"," And part of what's driving that new high, Chainalysis said, is a new emphasis on very large ransom"
"1679630","1685670"," payments with a share of $1 million plus ransom surging, even as the smaller payouts decline, as"
"1685670","1686890"," you can see on this chart here."
"1687270","1692090"," That means the bad guys are able to generate more revenue with less work."
"1692250","1697670"," And one piece of good news in all this though, Dom, total cryptocurrency value received by illicit"
"1697670","1699070"," addresses is way down. "
"1699070","1703730"," Now, that's a grab bag category that includes things beyond just ransom wear, including sanctions,"
"1704050","1708870"," violations, terrorist finance, child sexual abuse material, other terrible activities on the"
"1708870","1709110"," internet."
"1709450","1714570"," The figure for all illicit addresses was $39.6 billion in 2022."
"1715230","1719170"," That drops to $24.2 billion in 2023. "
"1719870","1720330"," Why is that?"
"1720630","1726810"," Well, it's in part because Chainalysis counts the $8.7 billion in creditor claims against collapsed"
"1726810","1734090"," crypto exchange FTX in their 2022 number, which drives up the total for that year."
"1734410","1738110"," So, you know, depending on how you count it, though, things look a little bit better than they did"
"1738110","1738630"," before, Dom."
"1738750","1739110"," Back over to you. "
"1739250","1739570"," All right."
"1739690","1739750"," Amen."
"1739910","1740810"," Jabers with the latest there. "
"1740910","1741510"," Thank you very much."
"1741570","1746730"," Now, speaking of cybersecurity, let's get some show and tell here where we show you a chart and"
"1746730","1747550"," then tell you the story."
"1748290","1753950"," Opta shares are spiking 20% after the cybersecurity giant beat earnings and revenue estimates and"
"1753950","1754930"," posted strong guidance. "
"1754930","1760210"," Now, as a result, Bank of America is double upgrading that stock from underperformed to a buy"
"1760210","1766550"," rating and boosting its target price to from $64 all the way up to $165."
"1767330","1773070"," Here's what the CEO told money movers about the ramp up they're seeing in those cyber attacks."
"1775750","1781490"," In the last 30 days, we've blocked over 2 billion malicious attacks against our customer base. "
"1781490","1784750"," We're not always perfect and we're trying to improve that and get better."
"1785090","1789450"," But the big picture story is that identity based attacks are a very serious problem."
"1789770","1794630"," Over the many years ahead, we're going to be a $5 billion and $10 billion company. "
"1795410","1799330"," And we're confident that we can continue to grow to those levels and also deliver profitability."
"1800350","1800910"," All right."
"1800970","1801750"," Cyber big focus. "
"1802190","1804690"," Now, let's send it over to Tyler Matheson for a CNBC news update."
"1804690","1805150"," Hi, Tom."

"1849830","1851670"," I go there all the time."
"1852110","1853710"," Well, not all the time, but often enough."
"1854410","1856350"," The final scene of the series was filmed there. "
"1856550","1858710"," The booth is being put up for auction on eBay."
"1860070","1862450"," Done so last night to help fund the diner's renovations."
"1863170","1866190"," Bids had already topped $30,000 by noon today. "
"1866810","1869010"," Dominic, they have really good ice cream there."
"1869010","1871990"," Great candies and terrific grilled cheese sandwiches."
"1872350","1872930"," I recommend it. "
"1873010","1875330"," Two thumbs up from Tyler Matheson there."
"1875590","1875970"," Absolutely."
"1876170","1876810"," Thank you very much. "

"1894910","1899910"," Coming up on the show, it's the biggest publicly traded golf company in America that you've"
"1899910","1901090"," probably never heard of."
"1901610","1905950"," A rare and exclusive interview with the CEO of the parent company of Titleist. "
"1906390","1910910"," The company is called the Cushnet on the business of golf, the consumer, and the pending deal"
"1910910","1913370"," between the PGA Tour and Live, possibly."
"1913910","1914910"," That's next after the spring."
"2086210","2094330"," Welcome back to the exchange shares of a Cushnet Holdings. "
"2094330","2096830"," It's a great day on a wider than expected loss and a revenue missed for the quarter."
"2097070","2102490"," But those Titleist golf balls were a bright spot for that report and for a Cushnet overall."
"2103110","2110370"," So far this year, seven out of eight winners on PGA Tour events this year have used those Titleist"
"2110370","2110950"," golf balls. "
"2111470","2116710"," Joining me now for an exclusive interview and a CNBC debut is a Cushnet CEO, David Maher."
"2117290","2124110"," David, thank you very much for being here with us and I cannot help but see how you are looking"
"2124110","2129470"," at one of your U.S. golf ball manufacturing facilities."
"2129810","2136390"," Can you take us through why you're there and how significant golf balls are to the Titleist and the"
"2136390","2136990"," Cushnet business?"
"2138990","2140730"," Yeah, nice to speak with you today, Dom. "
"2141170","2144230"," I am at Titleist Ball Plan 3 in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
"2145090","2145630"," You said it."
"2145750","2148350"," The Acoustic Company is the parent of Titleist and Foot Joy. "
"2148790","2152410"," And the origin of the company goes back to the 1930s."
"2152410","2155190"," The company was founded up the street at Ball Plant 1."
"2156030","2161130"," And today we manufactured golf balls in Ball Plant 3, which you see behind me."
"2161490","2165070"," This particular plant makes Pro V1 and Pro V1X golf balls. "
"2165270","2170430"," We're running 24-7, have been for quite some time to keep pace with brisk demand up the road at"
"2170430","2171190"," Ball Plant 2."
"2171610","2175610"," We make the rest of our product lines as well, so we thought it appropriate if we're going to speak"
"2175610","2180190"," to you and your audience today to do so from Ball Plant 3 here in New Bedford, Massachusetts."
"2180190","2186610"," David, the stock right now is not exactly what you would like to see given the results that you"
"2186610","2187470"," reported out there."
"2188010","2194430"," It was a disappointing report, but golf balls and the Titleist brand specifically were a standout"
"2194430","2194790"," there. "
"2195010","2200150"," Can you take us through the positioning of Titleist from a brand from a golf ball perspective, a"
"2200150","2206230"," golf club, an equipment perspective, and what your expectations are for 2024, given where your"
"2206230","2207130"," stock is trading today?"
"2208550","2214110"," Yeah, and we look at our performance in 2023 as a great success."
"2214730","2221170"," Our business up over 40% in the last couple of years, and we put forth our guide today, which"
"2221170","2222510"," we see as real positive."
"2222810","2225190"," Just heads up here, not toppy yet. "
"2225450","2229830"," You're coming back to a five-minute back check on that five-minute trigger."
"2230330","2233210"," If we're going to roll here, you want to see."
"2234030","2237470"," You want to see the confirmation of the role. "
"2237890","2240510"," So you're looking for price to come down here, right?"
"2240950","2242310"," Break below, right?"
"2243030","2245150"," And then the failure by bulls here."
"2245610","2247790"," Right here is where that failure takes place."
"2248390","2256370"," Your percentage win rate down here is much higher than taking this trade. "
"2256670","2257990"," You want to wait for it to develop."
"2257990","2263790"," If you see this action start down here, then you start getting more aggressive."
"2263970","2269410"," Or if you're going to get aggressive up here, you have really tight stops to the upside right here"
"2269410","2270530"," if you're super bearish. "
"2270810","2276030"," Last year, that's about 150 million rounds per year more than we saw in 2019."
"2276490","2277690"," So the game is healthy."
"2277970","2278810"," The industry is healthy. "
"2279530","2282870"," We really feel good about our results from last year."
"2283250","2285330"," And we think we carry a nice momentum into 2024."
"2285330","2290370"," David, I think a lot of golfers out there in the audience know just who you guys are and what"
"2290370","2290730"," you do. "
"2291330","2296990"," But maybe some people are surprised to know that Akushnet is now the biggest by market value, pure"
"2296990","2301870"," play, publicly traded golf equipment company in the marketplace in America."
"2302370","2308470"," You've had a fairly steady climb since the pandemic lows driven by the COVID wave of golf"
"2308470","2308950"," popularity."
"2309690","2314330"," Some of your other competitors have seen some of that wave, but also seen some volatility as well. "
"2314910","2320470"," Why do you think your business has performed perhaps in a different manner from a volatility"
"2320470","2322730"," perspective and some of your other competitors out there?"
"2324070","2327870"," Yeah, as I said, our business up over 40% in the last couple of years."
"2328330","2333150"," And the first thing we tell people about our business is you need to understand our target"
"2333150","2333510"," consumer."
"2333630","2334870"," It's the game's dedicated player. "
"2334910","2335490"," They're avid."
"2335970","2336530"," They're passionate."
"2336990","2338350"," They play a lot in good times. "
"2338570","2339430"," They play in bad times."
"2339430","2342590"," They're not recession proof, but they're certainly recession resilient."
"2343190","2345550"," And as I said, we're coming off a year in 2023. "
"2345790","2348670"," We're record rounds of play in the US and around the world."
"2348670","2352330"," So lots of me optimistic about in the world of golf."
"2353050","2360030"," And I think I think we get credit for our focus on premium golf balls, premium golf clubs, our"
"2360030","2363430"," efforts to fit golfers, whether it's falls, whether it's clubs, whether it's footwear. "
"2364090","2368650"," I think it resonates with our golfers and certainly is resonated with investors over the years."
"2369330","2369770"," Today notwithstanding."
"2370090","2375250"," Well, David, do you feel as though, given all of that popularity and surge, there's anything to be"
"2375250","2379290"," made of what's happening right now in the world of professional golf, arguably where it's the most"
"2379290","2379630"," visible. "
"2380170","2386110"," A growing rift between professional golfers, between the PGA Tour and the Saudi-backed Live Golf"
"2386110","2386530"," Tour."
"2386950","2391070"," There seem to be some progress in deal making and maybe not at the same time."
"2391510","2395250"," Do you think the game is going to be in a good place given what we're seeing in terms of"
"2395250","2395550"," the friction?"
"2395550","2396590"," Just a heads up here. "
"2396870","2402650"," As we come into the two o'clock hour, you already know at that 1 30 to 2 p.m."
"2403010","2405250"," You see the fuckery inside of the market."
"2405470","2409610"," So just be aware, we have 15 minutes left until we hit that two o'clock hour."
"2418700","2420780"," The PGA Tour and SSG. "
"2421120","2425920"," I think that's a terrific partnership and I think the fans going to win from that SSG brings a"
"2425920","2430940"," whole lot of expertise that complements the tours, many expertise, and again, I think it's going to"
"2430940","2432840"," be a win for fans."
"2433420","2437160"," And then the next step is what happens with Live in the PGA Tour."
"2437380","2442800"," And by all accounts, they're certainly asking to both sides realize the importance of finding"
"2442800","2445920"," unification, bringing players together more often. "
"2446240","2449600"," And I think both sides realize the value and importance of doing that."
"2449840","2455060"," They haven't done it yet, but from what we hear and what we're hearing out of the tours, that's"
"2455060","2456320"," certainly a priority for both sides."
"2456320","2457740"," So we're optimistic long term. "
"2458160","2463200"," And again, I'll point to the recent move by the tour as a really important first step in their"
"2463200","2464880"," alliance with the Strategic Sports Group."

"2710420","2714580"," We're going to try to go through some of the bots and alerts."
"2715360","2716360"," We have open BB. "
"2717000","2719700"," We then have unusual whales bot right here."
"2720380","2722080"," That has a nice interface."
"2722480","2729060"," And then we have trainee ticks that posts alerts and you can also interact with the bot. "
"2729360","2731360"," So that'll be something that we look forward to tomorrow."
"2732460","2734880"," We're seeing all the top bullish flows here."
"2735560","2736660"," And bearish flows. "
"2737220","2740980"," Trady ticks AI bot is in here telling us about the call."

"2753040","2753940"," This one right here."
"2754780","2760540"," What I like best about these bullseye alerts is checking it against checking these trades against. "
"2760540","2762100"," The triggers."
"2762620","2764620"," So if we're let's say we're coming back and testing."

"2808800","2815500"," We pinned to the top of the page instructions on how to use the bots and alerts. "
"2816140","2822220"," And then if you collapse the category only when a new alert comes in will it pop up for you"
"2822220","2823060"," over here in the left."
"2823660","2827760"," So if you're collapsing a category only when a new alert comes through will you see it."
"2828280","2831860"," So if you want to click through and see how it disappears once you've seen the alert. "
"2832760","2840160"," Then below that we've got analyst grades for for individual tickers from trading ticks as well."

"2898060","2899680"," You can have access to those bots. "
"2899960","2901600"," If you see these bots are coming up."

"2911680","2913000"," Go back over here really quick."
"2914680","2916580"," Back to the general chat check in."
"2922500","2923420"," I mean tighter. "
"2923680","2924660"," I got a couple of things I got to do."
"2925840","2930600"," I wonder why that chat box is now not staying on anymore."
"2931120","2933820"," I'm going to find out why it's taking time to regenerate. "
"2935200","2937140"," I'd be reaching a limit or something."
"2939320","2941140"," Let me see what you guys are saying in the chat here."
"2948510","2949970"," Chat they're still open now. "
"2950410","2951590"," Alright so I'm going to go right back to a break."
"2951750","2953210"," I'll be back with you guys in just a minute here."
"2960520","2961800"," That on right there. "
"2962980","2964440"," The guys are good to go."
"2969460","2974740"," Welcome back to the exchange we're trading AI today in computers and chips and kale salads."
"2975380","2978700"," Dell net app and sweet green are the subject of today's earnings exchange. "
"2978740","2983560"," And here with our trade is Delano Seporro new street advisors founder and CEO."
"2983660","2985540"," He's also a CNBC contributor."
"2985540","2988120"," We're going to kick things off with Dell. "
"2988560","2992580"," The share price more than doubling over the past year despite weaker PC demand."
"2993080","2998140"," Loop Capital is seeing catalysts and artificial intelligence which could drive PC demand and"
"2998140","3002420"," increased enterprise spend on Dell's server offerings as well."
"3003200","3005480"," Delano you're a buyer of Dell here. "
"3005640","3006420"," Take us through why."
"3007020","3008500"," Hey Don thanks for having me."
"3008600","3013360"," Yeah I think one of the reasons why is if we see a refresh in the PC market and second"
"3013360","3018380"," half of this year I think that would help increase demand versus soften demand what we're seeing in"
"3018380","3019380"," consumers well enterprises. "
"3020440","3023960"," You just mentioned AI I think that's going to be a catalyst for a lot of companies especially when"
"3023960","3029240"," it comes to streamlining their internal operation and Dell is actually well positioned to bring"
"3029240","3031220"," those solutions to their clients as well."
"3031620","3033400"," So the valuation is the risk for me."
"3033500","3035200"," That's the one thing that can offset this opinion. "
"3035640","3039800"," The shares have been on a run and they're trading slightly expensive historically looking at the"
"3039800","3045160"," price but I think if you look at the diverse side business it's a buy here for myself and"
"3045160","3045760"," potentially for others."
"3046080","3050500"," All right let's move on to NetApp the data technology company basically flats since November's jump"
"3050500","3051360"," on stronger guidance."
"3051920","3056620"," Wedbush is noting higher costs and watching to see if companies pull back on cloud and data storage"
"3056620","3058800"," spending what do you want to see here Delano. "
"3059220","3063880"," Yeah one thing I want to see is looking at the IT spend I think that's different than we mentioned"
"3063880","3067220"," with Dell that actually spend in this area might flow."
"3067220","3071580"," So if you're looking at cloud consumption and a lot of enterprises are looking at slowing that down"
"3071580","3075420"," potentially or if you're looking at their subscriber base and enterprises are looking at slowing"
"3075420","3075960"," that as well."
"3076360","3080540"," That's a near-term risk for me but when I look at it I think the long-term catalyst after"
"3080540","3086120"," 2024 you know public consumption the data management NetApp is well positioned in my mind. "
"3086340","3090480"," So I think the risk of the IT spend but I think that will be overcoming out steps by the"
"3090480","3095320"," long-term trend that we're seeing when it comes to these cloud consumption services that NetApp is"
"3095320","3095560"," providing."
"3095560","3100360"," All right so NetApp down Dell Dell now we've addressed as well."
"3100800","3104080"," And then finally with the stock sweet green those shares are up 10% so far this year. "
"3104460","3110560"," But still well off its 2021 highs Oppenheimer is seeing stronger traffic trends and catalysts and"
"3110560","3116400"," new protein plate type offerings and the company's automated infinite kitchen system but Delano"
"3116400","3119760"," you're a little concerned about the strength of the salad consumer."
"3121080","3126300"," Exactly the strength of the cloud consumer and you know if sweet green is getting you know in this"
"3126300","3130220"," situation with macro environments that were potentially seen to lighter half this year if they're"
"3130220","3135880"," having a higher income consumer that would probably stabilize the man but I think they may not have"
"3135880","3136080"," that."
"3136220","3141740"," I also see strong competition of course you know kava chipotle it's a battle of pricing power being"
"3141740","3143360"," able to maintain that pricing power. "
"3143860","3148400"," So I would be stating here I think there's seen a lot of downgrades across the street and there's a"
"3148400","3152380"," lot of lower revisions on EPS and for me I want to see a little bit more of that growth"
"3152380","3154000"," story especially for a new IPO company."
"3154500","3160020"," All right so we got the trades there for Dell sweet green and NetApp and Delano Seporro at News"
"3160020","3163000"," Feed Advisors thank you so much we appreciate it we'll talk to you soon sir."
"3163420","3164320"," Thanks for having me Dom. "
"3164560","3168420"," All right well let's check on the markets right now the Dow is just at about 32 points at this"
"3168420","3168800"," stage."
"3169120","3172180"," We're just about near well off session lows at this point."
"3172520","3174000"," That does it for here for the exchange. "
"3174000","3177960"," Coming up on my own today is National Wear Disease Day."
"3178100","3185040"," They're going to speak with a Q&A company that's on the other side of this quick place."
"3185420","3191380"," Products apply to crude and petroleum products sold 2% in December to 20 spot 3 million boughs per"
"3191380","3193220"," day the lowest as well since September. "

"3347070","3349310"," Welcome to our lunch everybody alongside Courtney Reagan."
"3349890","3353810"," I'm Tyler Madison glad you did join us on this February 29th. "
"3353830","3359930"," It is the rarest day on the calendar and we market as wear disease day it is officially such."
"3360450","3364530"," A day to bring attention to disorders affecting relatively few people individually but when you"
"3364530","3369790"," realize there are thousands of these disease out there combined they affect millions of families."
"3370190","3372550"," Statistics are pretty staggering actually coming up. "
"3372830","3377750"," We will talk to the head of the National Organization for Rare Disorders about the scope of the"
"3377750","3378050"," problem."
"3378050","3379530"," You might be surprised as I was."
"3379530","3384350"," We'll talk to the CEO of a company working in this area about the process for getting treatments"
"3384350","3388870"," approved and we'll look at some of the stocks involved in this place as possible opportunities to"
"3388870","3392370"," invest in companies working to treat or even cure diseases. "
"3392370","3397350"," But first let's give you a check on the market says stocks are mixed following the latest read-on"
"3397350","3399210"," inflation that we got here this morning."
"3399710","3405190"," We have the NASDAQ composite up about six tenths of a percent the S&P 500 up three tenths of"
"3405190","3409310"," a percent out there was just about flat ahead to the downside."
"3409850","3414590"," Let's bring in Mike Santoli for more on the market reaction to this morning's PCE number. "
"3415250","3420670"," Mike I mean it was about what we had forecast but still hotter than I guess what the Fed wants"
"3420670","3421150"," to see."
"3421150","3422170"," For sure."
"3422450","3426950"," Courtney I would characterize the market responses kind of mild relief that it wasn't an upside"
"3426950","3428170"," surprise versus forecast. "
"3428750","3434290"," We've had two or three in a row inflation reports that did come in hotter than anticipated in hope."
"3434450","3438750"," So this was at least on target and it was it was warm in the areas we've known."
"3438750","3443530"," We're going to be stubbornly so like a lot of services things a lot of inferred prices on financial"
"3443530","3443870"," services. "
"3443870","3448210"," So it seems that the market is not really I'm doing much of that number however."
"3448310","3451790"," So nine point nine percent we were looking at a one third of a percent."
"3451790","3453550"," It's a three point six five million miles per day. "
"3453730","3455770"," I think the lowest in June of 2020."
"3456410","3459610"," To your note you went from the four point seven down to about four six two."
"3459990","3463030"," So it's obviously not a huge swing in either in either way. "
"3463350","3467530"," But it does show you that we're sort of checking off the box that the Fed preferred inflation"
"3467530","3468090"," measure."
"3468270","3472390"," Isn't any worse than we thought it was and inflation is kind of bouncing around below three percent"
"3472390","3472710"," somewhere."
"3473210","3473770"," All right Mike. "
"3473970","3474430"," Thank you very much."
"3474530","3478590"," How long should stay right there as we bring in our next guest who says the data don't matter all"
"3478590","3479030"," that much."
"3479050","3482690"," He says the Fed has a fiscal problem not a rates problem. "
"3482870","3486070"," Keith Fitzgerald is the principal of the Fitzgerald group."
"3486270","3486610"," Keep welcome."
"3486630","3487490"," Good to have you with us. "
"3487790","3489450"," What do you mean it has a fiscal problem?"
"3489450","3489710"," Explain."
"3490910","3491310"," Sure."
"3491430","3494030"," I'd be happy to you know the government take it or leave it. "
"3494050","3498170"," It doesn't matter which side of the aisle you're on has a spending problem as long as that"
"3498170","3502070"," continues the Fed really has to struggle because they may as well be taking blood out of their left"
"3502070","3503670"," arm and putting it in their right arm."
"3503970","3505550"," The markets are going to address this."
"3505650","3506610"," So that's what I mean by that. "
"3506890","3513910"," So what does that leave us as an investor to do when you see inflation coming in basically two"
"3513910","3517790"," point eight percent a little higher maybe than the Fed would ideally like to see year over year."
"3518090","3521770"," But the point four rise in January is nothing to be terribly alarmed about."
"3521950","3523570"," What should I do with my money now?"
"3524410","3526630"," Well you've actually raised a very interesting point. "
"3526630","3529670"," I think now is the time to take a deep breath to stick with what you know."
"3529890","3534150"," And that's the great company, world class companies that continue to put up great results, great"
"3534150","3539370"," numbers regardless of what the Fed actually thinks it's going to do or what traders think the Fed's"
"3539370","3539870"," going to do."
"3540630","3547110"," Let's talk about one of your picks and let's you make your thesis known on Apple which I think you"
"3547110","3554450"," think is a very good buy at these prices in part because it has now sort of junked its automobile"
"3554450","3558670"," operation and gone all in clearly on AI. "
"3559790","3560510"," I do."
"3560650","3566290"," I see this is another sort of jobs like moment when he reduced the iPhone back in 2007."
"3566290","3567870"," I think it was if my memory served. "
"3568370","3572470"," You know this is a moment where you're going to see a pivot something that is going to dramatically"
"3572470","3574650"," change the way the company is perceived."
"3574650","3576530"," Tim Cook's been hinting at it."
"3576650","3581050"," If you look behind the scenes, I think Apple is a lot more involved in AI than the world"
"3581050","3581490"," understands. "
"3581870","3587010"," And whatever happens in June at the developer conference, I think it's going to take a lot of"
"3587010","3587770"," people by surprise."
"3588070","3591890"," So I see prices moving sharply higher, perhaps even 275 a share or so."
"3592130","3595090"," That's pretty high compared to where we sit right now on Apple share. "
"3595190","3596930"," Which are just above 180."
"3597430","3598870"," Do you have a stake in Apple?"
"3599630","3600370"," Yes, I do."
"3600530","3600990"," I own it personally. "
"3600990","3603870"," My family does and our firm continues to recommend it to clients."
"3604550","3605130"," Got it."
"3605310","3610210"," Mike, when you look at any Mike Apple, which has been an underperformer, we used to say as goes"
"3610210","3612390"," Apple so goes the rest of the market. "
"3612530","3618090"," That doesn't necessarily seem to be the case anymore after the announcement knowing that they're"
"3618090","3623970"," walking away from the car, but potentially putting some more firepower into AI, which has really"
"3623970","3625290"," driven a lot of market growth."
"3625550","3629750"," Do you feel like the house devotes to pass these top government funding bills?"
"3629750","3631230"," That's in continues."
"3631470","3632690"," But again, the U.S. house. "
"3632910","3633390"," Really."
"3638090","3640410"," You guys just hear that out there."
"3640450","3646310"," The House of Representatives does have enough votes to pass the spending bill to keep the"
"3646310","3646910"," government open. "
"3647510","3648150"," Just a heads up there."
"3650790","3652550"," Entering 2024 one."
"3652890","3658150"," It's way too reliant on six or seven massive growth stocks, including Apple. "
"3658150","3659590"," Well, you've seen Apple falter."
"3659750","3661530"," You've seen alphabet falter."
"3661530","3664090"," This is Apple right down below here. "
"3664210","3669250"," We can see that right now that Apple's price is declining and it's underneath."
"3669770","3672390"," Soon it's hourly trigger as well."
"3672690","3675690"," And we've had the revised outlook to say, nope, we're not getting rate cut and mark. "
"3675790","3681090"," No bullish trade out here on Tesla or it's Apple unless you get above the hourly trigger back test"
"3681090","3682390"," day previous high."
"3683090","3683610"," So that happens."
"3683930","3685330"," No trade yet on Apple. "
"3685330","3688990"," I think that's really an important point that Mike has just made there."
"3689110","3693050"," And that is the idea that the market has been able against Nvidia."
"3693210","3694230"," Still looking good. "
"3694370","3700170"," I saw some Nvidia puts for July come in just a few moments ago, but cuts are nothing for right"
"3700170","3700510"," now."
"3700650","3703050"," Apparently they may not come in May."
"3703270","3704690"," Here's SPX's chart. "
"3704970","3711250"," This is where your original sellers were this morning selling into that if you 100 coming back up"
"3711250","3711470"," again."
"3711470","3714170"," I mean it's not that they won't try to do that."
"3714290","3714730"," Hold on here. "
"3715410","3716950"," They won't try to sell here."
"3717070","3718550"," Not saying they won't try to do that."
"3718770","3721210"," They try to take this down into tomorrow. "
"3722270","3728190"," But just note that we're still, you know, we're still out of that pin at 5100 to contend with."
"3728730","3732590"," And Peter podcast said it earlier this morning, but we know the same thing, right?"
"3732850","3740110"," All of this gamma pinning begins to roll off slightly into the end of the month on the 29th, which"
"3740110","3741830"," is today, last day today."
"3742010","3743690"," It's a solid holding that you can count on. "
"3744090","3745310"," Keith, thank you very much."
"3745530","3746610"," Keith Fitzgerald, we appreciate it."
"3746750","3747350"," Mike Santoli. "
"3747590","3749870"," You could see a small unplugged chapter today."
"3750110","3754550"," In Washington on breaking news, efforts to fund the government avoid a shutdown."
"3754910","3755050"," Emily. "
"3756430","3757170"," Hey, Tyler."
"3757370","3762010"," Well, Congress is rushing to avoid a shutdown that is now set to start on Friday at midnight."
"3762270","3765370"," And it's looking good for being able to avoid that. "
"3765550","3770610"," The House just now getting the votes needed to go ahead and pass that stopgap measure, kicking the"
"3770610","3776490"," can down the road to March 8th and then to March 22nd for both pieces of government funding."
"3776830","3781450"," It's that bill could now go to the Senate where it might be able to actually pass today."
"3781650","3784550"," Remember, you need all senators to agree to time limits. "
"3784550","3788690"," If you want something to move quickly, that seems like it does have the potential to happen."
"3788910","3793950"," And this point, Congress is moving quickly to try and get that stopgap in place, which means now"
"3793950","3794850"," the real big question."
"3795210","3799290"," Can they actually make these deadlines after moving the goal post yet again?"
"3799290","3804570"," Can we actually see some full fiscal year spending bills by March 8th and March 22nd?"
"3804770","3809230"," Lawmakers on the Hill are confident, but we have heard that before, so we're continuing to watch"
"3809230","3809730"," this closely. "
"3810090","3815230"," I was just going to say, it feels like it's a more story, a different day, a different year."
"3815530","3816730"," Thank you very much, Emily Wilkins."
"3817130","3821290"," Let's get to the bond marker reaction to that latest inflationary, Rick Sintelli joining us now"
"3821290","3822450"," from the Windy City. "
"3822890","3823070"," Hi, Rick."
"3824170","3827250"," Hi, and indeed, we had a lot of numbers this morning."
"3827770","3829630"," And let's hit some major highlights. "
"3830450","3835830"," Year over year, PCE Corps was something many were very anxious to monitor."
"3836290","3837330"," And how did it show up?"
"3837750","3841990"," Well, as you look at this chart, which starts in January of last year, we now have 12 consecutive"
"3841990","3845670"," months of lower year over year PCE Corps."
"3845830","3847330"," You see that line moving down. "
"3847630","3849270"," Now, here's one of the rubs."
"3849270","3854410"," If you open that chart to pre-COVID, you can see that even though we have come down, we are"
"3854410","3856510"," still a waste from where we were pre-COVID."
"3856690","3859270"," And we're still on our way to target two percent. "
"3859330","3861710"," You see they can bring Tesla up on another chart here."
"3861750","3863170"," I wanted to check back on Tesla."
"3863570","3865990"," Continue to look at all the variables today. "
"3866730","3868710"," Continuing claims also is a bit surprising."
"3869370","3872050"," It came out over 1.9 million."
"3872450","3875910"," We haven't done that since mid November of last year. "
"3875910","3879470"," But as you see on this chart, I went back to November of 21."
"3880030","3882410"," Here's the Tesla chart on the one minute."
"3882630","3888070"," They've got a cross above of the half-hour trigger coming down on top of this hourly trigger. "
"3888430","3890350"," In claims, they have to..."
"3890350","3893690"," It would like to see Tesla squeeze up here and retrain."
"3894370","3896630"," Finally, here's a chart year to date."
"3896730","3901690"," This prior high above here at 205, I'd really like to see this just come swinging right back up"
"3901690","3904810"," here and start to take out all this stuff from this morning. "
"3904810","3906470"," So keep your eyes on Tesla."
"3907210","3911410"," If it can get above 201, 24, you should see a nice squeeze."
"3912430","3919090"," First target would be 202, 206, a back test of 201, 24, and then go back and clean up 203,"
"3919710","3922310"," 10, and 204, 85. "
"3923170","3929610"," Before the 431 pre on 10s, now that moved down about 8 base points, but here's what I wanted."
"3929710","3932330"," So I'll leave the Tesla chart up down here for you as well."
"3932330","3938170"," In 2024, we're now 10 basis points below that in twos, but we're up 37 on the year. "
"3938450","3944610"," If you look at 10s, right now where it sits at 423, we're down 9 when it comes to the"
"3944610","3948150"," high yield closes, but we're up 35 on the year."
"3948370","3949330"," You get what I'm saying."
"3949550","3955090"," We're hugging up to higher levels, even though those numbers were to many, just perfect with"
"3955090","3955850"," respect to inflation. "
"3956750","3958070"," Tyler, back to you."
"3958070","3962550"," Rick, let me just get your sort of for put your forecasting hat on as you as we sit there"
"3962550","3964950"," with the 10 year in the 420 something."
"3965650","3972150"," Is it your view that we're likely to stay right around here in this sort of higher part of the"
"3972150","3976930"," band, then go back to where we were a couple of months ago in the high threes. "
"3978430","3979750"," I absolutely do."
"3980030","3982370"," So inflation is falling off with an expected."
"3982730","3988290"," 24 and those ratios I pointed out, I think it's actually more likely that we will be more in a"
"3988290","3993410"," range of four and a quarter to four and a half than we will be from anything under four up"
"3993410","3994170"," to four and a quarter. "
"3994290","3994730"," Thank"
"3994730","4006910"," you"
"4006910","4006910"," very much Rick Centelli."
"4006910","4011130"," Plus still to come in the program and in depth look at an issue that affects one in ten people"
"4011130","4011770"," here in the US."
"4012310","4016910"," Where diseases and conditions, chances are you know someone afflicted. "
"4017350","4022310"," So on this rare disease day, we want to sign a spotlight on the people, the industry and the"
"4022310","4025490"," treatments that are out there and may be coming."
"4025770","4026250"," We'll be right back."
"4038450","4041750"," You see if I can come in here with you guys for just a second here. "
"4044170","4046070"," So just another update here."
"4046550","4051670"," Let me get my camera back on here or how do I do this old man takes a break."
"4051670","4053010"," There we go. "
"4058750","4059950"," It's so weird."
"4060230","4060910"," I got some weird."
"4061130","4062490"," Oh, I already got that wrong. "
"4062610","4062790"," Okay."
"4062870","4063030"," All right."
"4063130","4063350"," Hold on. "
"4063830","4065970"," That goes right there."
"4066610","4067830"," That has to get locked."
"4068690","4073910"," And then the chat box gets unlocked right back over there. "
"4074630","4077010"," Okay, so into tomorrow."
"4077230","4079610"," So we've got one day we got today, right?"
"4080210","4081410"," And then we've got tomorrow."
"4085010","4087150"," Today is the last day of the month. "
"4087350","4088830"," Today is February 29th."
"4088890","4089610"," It's a leap year."
"4090910","4096649"," We get usually a beginning of the month flows that come in the first couple of weeks and we've got"
"4096649","4097729"," the end of quarter. "
"4098510","4099990"," March coming up, right?"
"4101189","4104450"," So for a few stuff we have coming up as well."
"4104870","4107229"," Tomorrow is the first day of March."
"4107970","4111310"," We will have a lot of options expire today. "
"4111470","4111890"," Not a ton."
"4112649","4113529"," But we do have options."
"4113770","4115430"," Options expiry today, right?"
"4115689","4117229"," I've got options out for the 28. "
"4118090","4122270"," That gamma becomes less important as that time gets closer."
"4122710","4129109"," And then also as that if no new trades come into offset those trades that are going out."
"4129109","4131270"," There can be some weakness. "
"4131529","4134750"," I'm not going to call it a window of weakness, but into Friday."
"4135550","4143330"," There's a possibility that you'll see people begin to want to find a dip to buy for the month of"
"4143330","4143590"," March."
"4144630","4153090"," Now saying that saying that I didn't get the dip that I wanted as of yet, right?"
"4153210","4157850"," I'm looking for that gap flows down below on SPX still haven't seen it. "
"4157850","4161529"," So I'm still cautiously looking for it, right?"
"4161970","4163189"," So we're going to look here at something."
"4163689","4166470"," We're going to take a look at the trigger full screen chart really quick."
"4167350","4169370"," And we're going to just talk about Friday. "
"4169510","4172710"," And then we're going to talk about prior highs, all that kind of stuff."
"4172990","4180910"," And we're going to look specifically back here in time on the high of February 23rd right here."
"4182109","4184270"," This is our last high back here. "
"4184270","4190830"," And for continuation for the bulls in the month of March, you want to be paying close attention to"
"4190830","4191149"," this."
"4191210","4194030"," Okay, you want to be paying close attention to this high."
"4194350","4195650"," This is where they teed off, right?"
"4196670","4198910"," And do we have continuation for the bulls?"
"4199110","4204210"," Are we able to get back up here and say, Hey, yeah, we're on our way to new highs. "
"4204230","4208570"," We're going to trade 5.5, 535, anything like that."
"4209150","4210990"," And that's what we're working on right here, right?"
"4211130","4212930"," You can see all of this work right here."
"4212930","4221710"," You can see as well that large traders are selling into this strength as we come up here into the"
"4221710","4223030"," last day of the month, right?"
"4223670","4226030"," So today specifically into the close. "
"4226730","4227590"," Hold on here."
"4227650","4229150"," I'm going to mute this in the background here."
"4229970","4233730"," So we said, so into the end of this month flows here, right?"
"4234030","4239110"," I expect us to trade up into this close today, right?"
"4239110","4241170"," Try to get everything out that they can. "
"4241410","4246330"," They're selling into that strength here and maybe see some weakness into Friday."
"4246530","4252170"," Now, the one thing that's bothering me here is for that, if we're going to go up and go crazy"
"4252170","4256490"," into the month of March, and at least the beginning of the month of March, because all this gap"
"4256490","4258390"," stuff down here never got closed."
"4258710","4263290"," Do we come back for this stuff in the end of March and just leave it behind?"
"4263290","4269130"," If we do leave it behind, we know we need to get above this yellow box right here. "
"4269770","4277730"," That can trigger us to then save it for that seasonal weakness that we should get into the end of"
"4277730","4279710"," quarter or even into possibly April."
"4281050","4287670"," So for right now, for myself, I would say to you guys that trade this zone right here, this pin"
"4287670","4290850"," in the day up here at 5100, right?"
"4290850","4298390"," And then I wouldn't be trying to take along above it like confident that we're going to 525 unless"
"4298390","4303970"," you see some price action like this and then the trade higher and you beat the previous trade."
"4304230","4305430"," You see some action like this?"
"4305950","4310190"," Heck, yeah, we're going to start running and it's going to be balls to the walls until we get up"
"4310190","4312590"," there to that four or 5%. "
"4312590","4319030"," If we fail to, I am still going to, if we get week tomorrow on, if we go up here,"
"4319210","4325090"," pin for the end of month and we roll down on Friday, I'd be looking more for a dip buy"
"4325090","4332810"," again into the next two weeks, next week or two from Friday, Monday, Tuesday for that run to the"
"4332810","4333110"," upside."
"4334070","4338950"," Maybe a quick blast down would be, I would love to see the quick blast down and then a toe"
"4338950","4340970"," curling run to the upside personally."
"4340970","4349230"," But either way, if we're above that 510 or or 5, 5100 on SPX, we'll take it either way. "
"4350750","4355430"," I think that's all I got to give you guys and I'll write that up into a report for you"
"4355430","4357330"," after the close today."
"4357330","4365190"," If you're a subscriber level or higher, you're going to get an update on spy and QQQs that lays all"
"4365190","4369550"," of this out for you for Friday and into next week."
"4371350","4372510"," We'll back over here. "
"4392960","4394240"," You got gold up today."
"4394340","4396020"," I didn't check the miners again this week."
"4396140","4397800"," I should have checked back in on those miners. "
"4398660","4402360"," I saw that there was a discussion about them earlier this week on CNBC."
"4402820","4406200"," I think we looked at miners and then there was a big topic of conversation."
"4421380","4427120"," Trading higher now, knocking out all these previous highs back here, taking out the next one"
"4427120","4428000"," currently right here. "
"4428060","4428980"," We took out the first one."
"4429180","4430520"," Here comes the second one right here."
"4431720","4435420"," We got one more behind it above at 50880. "
"4445970","4448230"," 10 BDA blasting off now."
"4448950","4453770"," Apple trying to recover right now after that shit show on CNBC."
"4454710","4457670"," Tesla is still being rejected right now. "
"4457730","4463410"," You can see there's some resistance above here on Tesla at this cross 20124."
"4464050","4465710"," So we'll monitor that trade as well."
"4467550","4470670"," Well, if you look at IWM, it looks so fucking beautiful. "
"4470790","4471350"," Look at it."
"4471430","4472010"," It's just gorgeous."
"4473190","4475310"," IWM looks sexy right now, by the way. "
"4475670","4476510"," Looks really good."
"4476610","4476990"," I like it."
"4479510","4483050"," Trading 50823, squeezing higher right now on spoos. "
"4486110","4487410"," I got to take this call."

"4994500","4996360"," people and families affected by them. "
"4996700","4997240"," Let me just now."
"4997380","5002920"," Peter Salton stall, president and CEO of the National Organization of Rare Disorders, also known as"
"5002920","5007680"," Nord, and here on set with us, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, our friend, former FDA commissioner and a CNBC"
"5007680","5008320"," contributor."
"5008600","5009340"," Welcome to both of you. "
"5009740","5011260"," Peter, let me begin with you."
"5012000","5013260"," What is a rare disease?"
"5013780","5014520"," How do you define it?"
"5015280","5020280"," A rare disease in the United States is defined as a population of patients under 200,000."
"5021200","5024860"," And that's the driver for the open drug act. "
"5025220","5031980"," If you put all of those diseases with 200,000 or fewer cases combined, how many people are you"
"5031980","5033080"," talking about in the aggregate?"
"5034220","5039840"," Well, we say that there are 7,000 rare diseases and about 30 million people in America, one in 10"
"5039840","5041900"," Americans that are impacted by rare diseases."
"5042260","5043900"," So it's a significant number."
"5044220","5046680"," So rare diseases are prevalent then. "
"5046880","5051280"," They may be rare, but in some, they are quite prevalent."
"5053220","5054220"," That is correct."
"5054480","5054940"," That is correct. "
"5055220","5060220"," And I would say, Tyler, the important thing here is that with the 7,000 rare diseases in the 30"
"5060220","5065680"," million Americans, 95% of them now don't have an authorized food FDA therapy."
"5065880","5067460"," And so that's a real challenge."
"5067660","5070620"," So we have 95% of the population who don't have a therapy. "
"5070860","5074080"," How costly are these diseases in the aggregate?"
"5074080","5080300"," Number one, and number two, are they normally life threatening, life limiting, or are they chronic"
"5080300","5082180"," and manageable in that sense?"
"5084060","5088400"," I'm not, I'm not a physician so I'll let Scott answer part of that question, but I can tell you"
"5088400","5094560"," that they are economically a burden on the, on the economy and the country acts, you know, because"
"5094560","5098520"," they, the issue of being misdiagnosed happens to patients continually."
"5098980","5100240"," We have most of our patients."
"5100500","5102340"," It takes four to five years to get diagnosed. "
"5103080","5108000"," So there's a lot of healthcare costs that goes into that before there's even a therapy developed."
"5108000","5109740"," So it's inexpensive."
"5110420","5116900"," It's inexpensive and timely and, you know, a complicated issue for patients. "
"5117360","5119760"," Scott, are rare diseases increasing?"
"5120360","5122140"," It feels like I'm hearing about them more."
"5122320","5125360"," Or is it just the awareness of such is what we're hearing about?"
"5125400","5129040"," Yeah, I think it's awareness and I think it's also that more rare diseases are addressable now."
"5129160","5133680"," So now we're talking about them, you know, nor has been instrumental in getting in place incentives"
"5133680","5138420"," for companies to try to develop drugs for these, these diseases, including the orphan drug act"
"5138420","5140940"," getting that implemented initially and also sustaining it. "
"5141040","5145760"," I think we're in an environment now where it's more difficult to get policy to confer incentives"
"5145760","5148480"," for the development of some therapeutics for these rare diseases."
"5148780","5150820"," And what we're looking at is super orphan diseases."
"5151220","5154940"," You know, diseases that can affect thousands and sometimes hundreds of patients where you now have"
"5154940","5159540"," the modalities to try to treat some of these diseases where the economic incentives aren't always"
"5159540","5162240"," there, not we stay in the very high prices that charge for these drugs. "
"5162240","5165640"," It could still be very uneconomical to develop therapeutics for these indications."
"5166420","5170200"," And we're not, we don't have the same policy solutions for these challenges that we had years ago,"
"5170260","5172320"," because you don't have the same consensus in policy circles."
"5172580","5175540"," And particularly diseases where you have sort of a common phenotype. "
"5176100","5180560"," So the patients have a common experience, but there might be a different genetic variation for even"
"5180560","5186080"," individual patients where you now have platforms like SIRNA or oligonucleotides, where you could"
"5186080","5192340"," literally change the drug for each individual patient to attack some of these diseases like this is"
"5192340","5198360"," where it's very hard not only to get an essential case of April for each individual at $1.86, crude"
"5198360","5203760"," oil futures, WTI crude April futures settling at $78.26 a barrel."
"5204560","5211460"," And that is down 28 cents or is bought 3.6%. A gasoline match for each individual at $2.30."
"5212200","5213860"," These are March for each $2."
"5213860","5217560"," The challenge for a bigger drug maker getting into some of these spaces is when you look at some of"
"5217560","5222140"," these drugs, if you're talking about this, it might suffer from a dish and be sort of political"
"5222140","5228300"," backlash to charge in the high prices that you need to sustain the investment and get a return on"
"5228300","5228300"," investment. "
"5228780","5233360"," It's very hard to do inside a big drug maker because they're more prone to getting the sort of"
"5233360","5235840"," political recriminations over the high prices."
"5236060","5240780"," So you see this be largely the domain of smaller companies, which I think have more latitude to"
"5240780","5241500"," charge those prices."
"5241500","5245920"," So you've seen in recent years large companies get out of these orphan spaces and that does worry"
"5245920","5247440"," me that you see capital coming out. "
"5247720","5251860"," And I'm talking particularly about the super rare diseases where there's still I think is a market"
"5251860","5252200"," failure."
"5252680","5256900"," And also it's very hard to do second to market innovation in some of these indications."
"5257240","5260920"," So what happens is after a therapy comes to market and you treat everyone with an inherited"
"5260920","5265360"," condition, for example, the number of patients who will be newly diagnosed each year with that"
"5265360","5269200"," condition isn't enough to sustain someone else coming into that space. "
"5269200","5274000"," And so some of these categories remain monopolies in perpetuity because you just can't incentivize"
"5274000","5276160"," second to market innovation that would bring down prices."
"5276980","5280100"," Let me ask you a question about the regulatory environment, Scott."
"5280320","5281960"," And I'll come back to you, Peter, in just a moment. "
"5283440","5293260"," I'm guessing that the regulatory regime is set up to test drugs for the broadest efficacy and"
"5293260","5295280"," safety for the broadest number of people."
"5295280","5301300"," And here you have, by definition, conditions where there may be 150, 200, 500 people in the United"
"5301300","5301700"," States."
"5302300","5306800"," How do you test drugs in such a small sample set?"
"5307140","5308240"," Yeah, look, it's very hard. "
"5308440","5312800"," And that's why when I was there and FDA has continued to try to build what we call natural history"
"5312800","5317520"," models where you can randomize against what is perceived to be the natural history of patients with"
"5317520","5319380"," a condition so you don't have to randomize the placebo."
"5319380","5324180"," But when you're talking about these modalities where you can individualize the treatment for"
"5324180","5328340"," patients based on their unique genetic profile, where they have sort of a common phenotype like"
"5328340","5333460"," baton's disease, but every patient might have a very small difference in the genetic variation that"
"5333460","5334280"," drives the disease."
"5334720","5335920"," And you want to deliver the drug. "
"5336080","5337900"," You want to tweak the drug for each individual patient."
"5338220","5343220"," That's very hard because the regulatory model tries to incentivize the standardization of"
"5343220","5346320"," treatments and not the variation for each individual patient."
"5346320","5349880"," That's what we need, I think, some novel thinking about the regulatory path. "
"5350100","5354340"," Peter, I read that 80% of rare diseases are genetically based."
"5354880","5362560"," Does that provide us now that we are mapping genes and the technologies like CRISPR and others, we"
"5362560","5367600"," can actually target genetic malformations or whatever they are."
"5368100","5368700"," We can target them. "
"5368840","5372280"," Is that a point of promise for the treatment of rare disease?"
"5372580","5374400"," And if so, how big a point of promise is it?"
"5374400","5379880"," And I really think, again, and Scott, what Scott just said about how the approach of being now, I"
"5379880","5385180"," think the genetic issue for us really is the future of the frontier."
"5385560","5390220"," And what we're seeing now more and more is the opportunity for people to be able to get something"
"5390840","5395300"," basically just for them, if you will, which is which does still create the problem that we were"
"5395300","5398000"," just talking about, which is much smaller populations."
"5398000","5405480"," And there is not a policy or regulatory form right now that allows us to be able to do that"
"5405480","5406540"," really effectively. "
"5406880","5411040"," So I think while the future is there, there's a lot of work that needs to be done on a"
"5411040","5415600"," regulatory plant to be able to make sure that we can get drugs approved and then paid for the"
"5415600","5415980"," smaller."
"5416220","5421100"," In other words, if I have a small population and I'm tweaking the drug so it works only for you,"
"5421100","5427980"," or essentially only for you, then you'll become, in a way, the test case for that drug."
"5428640","5429760"," You become the key thing. "
"5430680","5431080"," Exactly."
"5431500","5434780"," Yeah, these are these N of one diseases and that's what I'm referring to."
"5434840","5435760"," It might not be an N of one. "
"5435860","5438440"," It might be five or six patients with one unique genetic variation."
"5439100","5443920"," What you need to have is a pathway that allows companies to study sort of an aggregation of these"
"5443920","5448000"," patients and then extrapolate beyond that to other patients that have the common phenotype."
"5448360","5452600"," They have the common syndrome, but they might have different genetic variations that might not have"
"5452600","5453800"," been included in the clinical trial. "
"5453800","5457720"," And that's where the regulatory pickup is right now in the willingness of regulators to allow that."
"5457720","5459140"," The system isn't set up for that."
"5459700","5463320"," And it's been something that's been talked about literally for about 10 years right now, how to"
"5463320","5465620"," create a viable regulatory model for this. "
"5465840","5468360"," That's where the real opportunity is for these super rare diseases."
"5468700","5471640"," And a lot of them are inherited diseases that children are born with."
"5471860","5474280"," So there's a really compelling desire to try to get treatments. "
"5475060","5480180"," So not only stay in the economic model, which I think also is a barrier to the investment in these"
"5480180","5483680"," spaces, the regulatory model does become also an impediment."
"5484260","5484700"," Wow."
"5484880","5489480"," Can I just add to what Scott said, because I think there's one of the really important points that"
"5489480","5491520"," they're trying to find those patients as well. "
"5492000","5496540"," And one of the things that we've done in the last couple of years is develop a broad network called"
"5496540","5497260"," the Centers of Excellence."
"5497620","5502460"," We've now connected 41 of the top academic medical centers around the country and are connecting"
"5502460","5505920"," all of those clinicians via a thing called North Central."
"5506000","5510920"," So if they see something in a unique patient, they can then reach out onto that network and ask"
"5510920","5511880"," other clinicians. "
"5511880","5516580"," If they see something like that so that we can start to bring, as Scott was just saying, some of"
"5516580","5519400"," those small populations identify those people and bring them together."
"5519820","5523700"," It makes a lot of sense information sharing really paramount to solving some of these very"
"5523700","5524520"," difficult problems."
"5524860","5526840"," Really important conversation here, salt and salt. "
"5527080","5527720"," Thank you very much."
"5527720","5528940"," And Dr. Gottlieb, stick around."
"5529160","5530880"," We have much more to come. "
"5530880","5535440"," Still ahead, we'll continue our special coverage of Rare Disease Day with a leading name and gene"
"5535440","5535800"," editing."
"5536040","5540180"," First of our therapy next CEO, Sam McCarney joins us from Power Lunge Returns."
"5728380","5731780"," Welcome back to Power Lunge, as we continue to mark Rare Disease Day. "
"5731940","5736380"," Let's take a closer look now at companies trying to do good and do well with treatments for these"
"5736380","5736720"," diseases."
"5737500","5741980"," Look at Crenetics pharmaceuticals up 115% in a year."
"5741980","5745140"," See that big spike in September, fairly straight up there. "
"5745440","5748700"," That was on positive news regarding a treatment of a rare hormone disorder."
"5749240","5753120"," Bridge Bio Pharma has also tripled in the past year with a big jump last July."
"5753660","5757280"," We each drug to treat a rare heart disease showed positive results in the trial. "
"5757780","5760920"," CRISPR Therapeutics is another name involved in the rare disease phase."
"5761080","5765760"," You might have heard of it seeing some pretty big gains over the last year as well up over 70 "
"5765760","5766660","% in a year."
"5766660","5772260"," So joining us now as Mayor of Calcarni, CEO of CRISPR Therapeutics and Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former"
"5772260","5775880"," FDA Commissioner and a CNBC contributor is still with us. "
"5776180","5780300"," We should say that Dr. Gottlieb is also a partner at the Venture Farm New Enterprise Associates,"
"5780300","5783380"," which is an early investor in CRISPR."
"5783640","5785340"," Thank you very much for being here, Sam."
"5785660","5786500"," Really appreciate it. "
"5786620","5789820"," I mean, obviously we had a very fascinating conversation."
"5790200","5793920"," I don't know if you were able to hear all of it, but it's sort of about the hurdles to"
"5793920","5799200"," getting some of these drugs through when it comes to regulatory or otherwise just being able to"
"5799200","5802480"," invest the money that it takes to tackle some of these issues."
"5803000","5808340"," Where are we right now with your company, with CRISPR, when it comes to tackling rare diseases?"
"5809540","5814900"," Yeah, thank you for having me and it's great that you're recognizing World Rare Disease Day in the"
"5814900","5815380"," last segment. "
"5815380","5818420"," The speaker was mentioning that there are 7,000 rare diseases."
"5819260","5824120"," And what's disheartening is, you know, 80% to 90% of those rare diseases do not have a good"
"5824120","5825860"," treatment available for those patients."
"5825880","5834900"," And this is the last $83.62 about, which is down 6 cents or 0.07% on the session. "
"5834900","5839760"," So it's called the season of Palestinian truth, the more well known rare diseases with our partner"
"5839760","5840100"," vertex."
"5841300","5842760"," But that's just the start."
"5843060","5848840"," You know, what we have with the CRISPR technology is a programmable and scalable platform, which"
"5848840","5853220"," can apply to many rare diseases and not just provide a treatment, but provide a transformative"
"5853220","5854960"," treatment for these rare diseases. "
"5855540","5861260"," When it comes to what you're expecting going forward, what can we look forward to give us some good"
"5861260","5862340"," news on the horizon?"
"5862340","5867700"," Or is there research that's just getting so very close to offering some new treatments for some of"
"5867700","5868320"," these individuals?"
"5869600","5873180"," Yeah, Scott will attest the science is moving at breakneck speed."
"5873180","5877600"," And it's not just for therapeutics, but the other companies in space as well doing work with rare"
"5877600","5878100"," diseases."
"5878620","5884340"," We're working with a number of rare diseases, for instance, rare forms of cancer like T cell"
"5884340","5884940"," lymphomas. "
"5884940","5886340"," We're working type 1 diabetes."
"5886880","5891180"," We're working on rare autoimmune diseases like Lucas nephritis and also."
"5891920","5893580"," What are these guys doing right now?"
"5893680","5897240"," These guys, I'm loading all their shit for you on CNBC right now. "
"5897280","5900680"," This is the unload my crappy trades on you hour."
"5900880","5902780"," I think I feel like every day at two o'clock."
"5903960","5908880"," So I think someone said that today and knows or yesterday we were discussing it when all the"
"5908880","5914540"," options bros are on CNBC and they're like, I've been it or I think you guys should buy this ticker"
"5914540","5916740"," because I'm longing it right now. "
"5917020","5918580"," Or I'm trying to exit right now."
"5918580","5919380"," You're my exit liquidity."
"5920360","5922340"," Some of those things do spike though. "
"5922460","5923980"," I do sometimes see some of the tickers."
"5924100","5929520"," They talk about spike on discussions, but then I feel like a lot of it's unloading."
"5930160","5933000"," We're coming into 249 right now. "
"5933000","5939600"," We've got 11 minutes left to the half an hour for 3 p.m. A little bit of weakness here"
"5939600","5940260"," in spy."
"5940960","5943220"," We've got a small cross coming up here."
"5943260","5944580"," A small bear cross right here. "
"5945060","5948640"," You have sometimes you can see some pretty big downside moves."
"5949260","5955240"," I want you to I want to draw your attention to this first cross right here."
"5956160","5959940"," So we have this first bear cross right in here right you see it right there. "
"5959940","5967660"," And you can sometimes if you if they actually confirm the second cross we can get an amplified"
"5967660","5969500"," bearish reaction."
"5969660","5974120"," So here's your first one right here right you got this one right here."
"5974560","5976960"," So that's your first bear cross right there. "
"5978280","5983820"," And this one has not set up yet, but I never like these if they happen."
"5984380","5986480"," So that's the only thing I want to point out to you."
"5986480","5991080"," I still think we pin the clothes, but coming into this three o'clock half an hour here. "
"5992100","5995100"," This looks like some weakness right to see it right there."
"5997120","5998560"," Just watch this right here."
"5998660","6001500"," You're seeing some some stops being taken out right here. "
"6001940","6007080"," I'm watching for that move right there in a little bit of blood a little bit of a blood bath"
"6007080","6008100"," coming up down here."
"6008100","6013720"," So just be careful of this stuff down here for the next 10 minutes or so are possibly even into"
"6013720","6014840"," the 330 hour."
"6014840","6020700"," And then maybe you see the ramp up into the clothes from 330 until 4 p.m. if it does"
"6020700","6021380"," even happen. "
"6021940","6027560"," If you look down below here IWM trying to come back down and retest it's hourly trigger as well."
"6027980","6029540"," I still like this setup down here."
"6029980","6036040"," This is probably my favorite my favorite set up versus like cues or SPY. "
"6036220","6037900"," There goes the first blood move to the downside."
"6037900","6044160"," And then if you look at SPX over here right you can see them coming into cell right."
"6044560","6046100"," So here's SPX. "
"6046740","6050100"," You've got the cell pressure above right there."
"6051140","6053940"," You got that next cell pressure above right there."
"6054100","6055560"," Wait a minute just shoot back over there. "
"6056340","6059680"," And they're coming in once more."
"6059840","6060500"," They're angry man."
"6060500","6064860"," They're not just sellers but there's probably some shorts that are angry. "
"6065420","6070520"," And then you've got people unloading with that people but institutions funds that are unloading and"
"6070520","6072900"," taking profit for the end of month."
"6073960","6078760"," And you can see that right there right selling into strength selling into strength selling into"
"6078760","6079280"," strength."
"6080140","6083800"," So just a little bit of weakness right now in the SPY. "
"6083800","6089680"," We'll wait and see what happens in this close if we're going to creepy crawly up the wall or not."
"6090420","6093620"," I still like this whole setup."
"6093800","6094700"," This looks gorgeous man. "
"6094800","6098480"," Look at that hourly trigger just carrying the market higher and higher and higher."
"6098640","6100040"," You see that beautifulness right there?"
"6100720","6102540"," Fire demand just stepping in."
"6102920","6104800"," Fire demand just stepping in. "
"6105060","6106600"," Fire demand just stepping in."
"6106980","6109400"," Huge demand right there stepping in."
"6109400","6111600"," And you're getting this fight right. "
"6111940","6113040"," Sellers coming down."
"6113320","6113840"," Sellers."
"6114740","6115520"," Sellers coming. "
"6115660","6117060"," I love these charts man."
"6117200","6118580"," I love when it does this stuff right."
"6119280","6125260"," This is that this is that coiling effect right that we talked about right. "
"6125420","6128440"," You come down here right of range expansion here right."
"6130380","6131260"," Consolidation here."
"6131560","6134740"," We start to coiling for a larger move right. "
"6135020","6137580"," See that coiling action right here trying to do the breakout."
"6137580","6146020"," Trying to try to shake you out to find out if we have more buyers or more sellers and for"
"6146020","6148520"," range expansion to come into next week."
"6149280","6150240"," Right there right. "
"6150520","6151560"," Beautiful beautiful action."
"6151700","6152660"," I love this price action."
"6152660","6157040"," We're near some resolution for bulls and bears. "
"6157040","6159100"," We're getting wound up here."
"6163440","6164380"," Wound up baby."
"6165300","6166300"," Make or break. "
"6166500","6168140"," Which way are we going up or down cap?"
"6173470","6177530"," Well I'll turn this turn this rare disease day stuff on down here."
"6177770","6179930"," But from an economic and financial perspective."
"6180590","6182430"," Can you tell us why this is a good investment?"
"6183170","6183690"," Absolutely. "
"6183950","6187450"," And we're redoubling our efforts at CRISPR have therapeutics because of two reasons."
"6187450","6191750"," One is with the platform like CRISPR you're taking a deterministic approach."
"6191750","6195670"," So you have less failures and less attrition and VDA still above. "
"6195790","6197110"," It's one in five minute trigger here."
"6197110","6198910"," As I said, it's modular and programmable."
"6198910","6205630"," So if you develop the platform, then you just have to replace the genetic oligonucleotide for each"
"6205630","6205930"," disease. "
"6206010","6208730"," So what that does is reduce the cost of development."
"6209170","6211890"," You know, in many cases for my car might cost."
"6211890","6213110"," Yeah, plenty not. "
"6213310","6216110"," I'm on agreement with you to a lot of to a lot of extent, man."
"6216270","6217730"," It's like, I'm going to try."
"6217950","6221630"," I don't think I'm going to try to do is outside of market hours. "
"6221630","6226910"," I'm going to sign up for Bloomberg for a month and we'll try Bloomberg out and see how they do."
"6227110","6229750"," But tens of disease that they're going to cure with the."
"6229830","6231250"," We're going to we'll try Bloomberg out. "
"6231370","6232250"," This is so fascinating."
"6232250","6233070"," Sam Cole Kearney."
"6233230","6234550"," Thank you very much for joining us. "
"6234550","6237230"," Dr. Scott Gottlieb is here and he's sticking around."
"6237230","6240050"," Alright, coming up shares of note of no vote."
"6240470","6243430"," No vote nor desk are up 70% over the past year. "
"6243590","6245590"," Ozempic demand continuing to soar."
"6246290","6248050"," And during February we celebrate Black Heritage."
"6248410","6252070"," Here's M&T Bank CEO Renee Jones sharing his story. "
"6256130","6259950"," As a Black CEO of a Fortune 500 company, I may be an exception."
"6260810","6264270"," But it's important to remember that there are many exceptional people who create positive change"
"6264270","6266010"," and inspire others every day."
"6266010","6271530"," Black Heritage Month gives us that opportunity to celebrate the many exceptional, absolutely"
"6271530","6274590"," extraordinary people in our Black and Brown communities across America. "
"6294870","6300370"," The so I was looking at so this morning I was looking at the blue or yesterday after the close."
"6300370","6305690"," I was looking at the Bloomberg TV and then Bloomberg plus."
"6306630","6313910"," And what I noticed was I could be wrong on this, but what I took away from it was Bloomberg"
"6313910","6315590"," TV is delayed. "
"6316210","6318710"," I think it's delayed by 15 seconds."
"6319270","6320090"," Maybe longer."
"6320310","6323630"," I saw that you have to like sign up like tune in is like a delay. "
"6323990","6325030"," I've noticeable delay."
"6326570","6332310"," And so I tried to sign up last night on Bloomberg plus."
"6333190","6334630"," And I got a 404. "
"6335070","6336750"," I've actually got a really funny one."
"6336830","6338310"," It was one of the best 404s I've seen."
"6338850","6341870"," It was like the it was like the infinite screen. "
"6342530","6344430"," And it had some like funny shit."
"6344610","6348230"," Whoever the devs are were really cool about it, but whatever."
"6349150","6353510"," So I couldn't sign up last night for the plus, but I want that's what I have right now is"
"6353510","6353690"," the. "
"6353690","6359070"," Well, there's two reasons I've got the CNBC pro because I do like some of their articles."
"6359330","6361450"," Some of the pro articles are pretty good."
"6362810","6366050"," Now they have a pro a new pro level for CNBC. "
"6367330","6369110"," I saw people messing with it."
"6369110","6374890"," It was really expensive, but I think it was 165 bucks a month or something like that."
"6375030","6375350"," I don't know. "
"6375430","6376310"," I might sign up for it."
"6376730","6382130"," But the reason I signed up originally for the pro on CNBC was because there was no native delay."
"6382130","6384550"," Now, maybe I'm wrong here because you know what else?"
"6384890","6390750"," I think Amazon Prime might have Bloomberg TV in real time. "
"6391790","6395450"," And I could put that on like a low quality video with the audio playing."
"6395830","6396090"," I'll check."
"6396390","6398290"," Let me check Amazon Prime right now. "
"6398370","6399170"," Maybe I can pull it up."
"6400090","6407890"," I think Amazon Prime might have Bloomberg TV that you'd pay the fee for for Amazon or Bloomberg"
"6407890","6408390"," plus."
"6409210","6411810"," I don't know if I'm saying all that right, but that's what I bought. "
"6411990","6417030"," I bought the CNBC pro for you guys so that if there's any articles that are good to go."
"6417930","6423010"," That they keep behind a paywall or if or for the broadcast to be real time."
"6423650","6428870"," If you're not finding value in that, let me know in the chat and we can test other things out. "
"6429630","6431910"," So I'll buy whatever you guys you guys want shit."
"6432350","6432710"," I got it."
"6432850","6433430"," I got you covered. "
"6433430","6438190"," So now you guys, we should we should start a you know what?"
"6438330","6438770"," How about this?"
"6440290","6444610"," I shouldn't be offering that I shouldn't be offering to do this stuff to the chat on the stream."
"6445530","6447990"," I will I will get in touch with four."
"6448430","6449670"," Five million a million. "
"6449670","6450650"," I'm not taking them."
"6452350","6453850"," So what I'll do is this."
"6454650","6455790"," I'll do what you want better. "
"6457350","6463350"," Inside of the discord, I will ask Bork to put a suggestion box up."
"6463690","6469310"," I can't guarantee we can have everything, but we can try things out until the entire community"
"6469310","6470150"," enjoys it."
"6470410","6475770"," Part of the good thing about what we do here is we want always want that free model, but then"
"6475770","6477410"," the people that are supporting what we're doing. "
"6478070","6481950"," We want to give them some say in what we do."
"6482390","6485150"," Write some direction or some insight and that kind of stuff."
"6485330","6489750"," So I'll ask Bork to put a suggestion box in the discord. "
"6490990","6494270"," So you guys can make suggestions like yeah, we don't like CMBC."
"6494770","6501430"," Let's try out Bloomberg or try out this or try out that and we'll try out whatever you want."
"6502130","6504030"," We figured we'd do that with the bots too. "
"6504210","6508210"," We're like I will pay for the premium bots and if people like them, we'll keep them."
"6508270","6509630"," If people don't like them, we'll get rid of them."
"6509630","6510510"," We'll try something different. "
"6512130","6514250"," So it'll be based on what you guys use."
"6514570","6515330"," We're going to check."
"6515470","6519630"," I think Bork also said he was going to check to see if you guys are using that stuff or"
"6519630","6519850"," not. "
"6520110","6521170"," I think it's a kick-ass value."
"6521630","6525150"," 30 bucks you get every premium bot you can get."
"6526410","6528550"," If there's anything that we're missing, let us know. "
"6529630","6531310"," Just that alone is a fucking steal."
"6532030","6533110"," It costs you like a few hundred."
"6533250","6535230"," That probably costs you 600 bucks a month or something. "
"6536350","6540470"," So we're hoping to give that value proposition for people that support."
"6541150","6544550"," I want to see our community grow over the years and become sustainable."
"6544550","6549230"," So I'll get that suggestion box in the discord. "
"6549610","6551770"," If he says, okay, I'm at the boss of that."
"6552370","6554050"," So I have to ask."
"6555230","6556470"," He might tell me no. "
"6558310","6559510"," I've been told no."
"6561530","6563150"," I don't want to micromanage people."
"6565090","6567610"," So we'll check with Bork and see what he says. "
"6572750","6574110"," Oh, he's here right now."
"6574190","6574870"," He's listening in."
"6576450","6577830"," He's actually going to do that. "
"6577990","6579990"," So the idea behind this is this."
"6581530","6585870"," If you guys want to ever give suggestions or, hey, can we try this or try that?"
"6585870","6589330"," Or we're not really liking this and we'd really like to see more of that."
"6589950","6590790"," Let us know. "
"6591070","6593050"," And I wanted to let you guys know something else."
"6593310","6599790"," If you are a, if you are a subscriber or a supporter or if you are a pro trader or"
"6599790","6601490"," one of the other, I want you to know something else."
"6601730","6608210"," We have some very, very talented developers that are working on more tools for you. "
"6609270","6610850"," We're not done launching stuff."
"6611010","6613050"," We got some crazy stuff getting launched here."
"6613050","6618690"," But I want you to know too, if you're like, you're a part of our community, right?"
"6619010","6620810"," So you have a free community here, right?"
"6621230","6622790"," And you're supporting us. "
"6623330","6631970"," So from your support for our free community, you have some kind of a vote or say that we are"
"6631970","6637250"," willing to listen to in the direction that we go if you're a supporter or a pro trader."
"6637250","6641030"," So if you're like, hey, man, will you guys ever work on gamma models?"
"6641030","6642490"," Will you guys ever work on?"
"6642750","6643330"," I don't know."
"6643650","6649270"," Jimmy earlier was asking about fed liquidity models, right?"
"6649490","6652170"," Do you want those posted or do you want a tool for that?"
"6652550","6653890"," Any of that kind of stuff?"
"6654910","6663450"," I know that David AMS is working on Golden Nuggets with triggers to launch with us in the future. "
"6663750","6669270"," So if you guys have any suggestions or anything like that, and you're in the discord, don't"
"6669270","6674590"," hesitate to post a suggestion so that we can look at those for the direction as we move forward."
"6674770","6675650"," And this is all brand new."
"6675890","6678350"," So this is where things are fun, right?"
"6679530","6680930"," This is kind of like the good times. "
"6681190","6683330"," If you're a subscriber and a pro trader, think about it."
"6683410","6684190"," We are brand new."
"6685130","6689110"," So you guys have a say to some extent as to the future of where we go. "
"6689930","6691190"," We did our thing, right?"
"6691350","6692530"," We did our thing."
"6692530","6696590"," We completed everything we wanted to complete and we're in phase two now."
"6696870","6701650"," So feel free to make a suggestion in the suggestion box in the discord. "
"6712270","6713430"," What happened over here?"
"6713510","6714530"," Oh, we got people in here."
"6715370","6717530"," We got people getting saucy in the chat."
"6719330","6721330"," What did people say in the chat?"
"6721510","6722030"," I didn't see it. "
"6722030","6725350"," Someone DM me what was said or DM me or text me."
"6726190","6727950"," I was missing what was said inside the chat."
"6730550","6735290"," Yeah, I didn't see what was said. "
"6735870","6737230"," It's the DM me what was said."
"6737330","6737850"," I didn't hear it."
"6738130","6739130"," I didn't see it or hear it. "
"6741850","6747490"," I missed that whenever that whole chat was."
"6758400","6761580"," Whoever that is, make sure we can ban them on YouTube too."
"6762160","6762980"," I don't know what was said. "
"6763180","6763800"," I didn't see anything."
"6765480","6766040"," What else?"
"6766820","6768760"," Jimmy Berry is asking right now."
"6770660","6777040"," He's saying I think it would be beneficial to all those if you also chart up where the liquidity is"
"6777040","6777440"," for the trader. "

"6903160","6903580"," field."
"6903580","6906260"," Like we just ran two 45 minute paths."
"6907720","6910740"," If any of you ever played soccer if you were a starter. "
"6911800","6916020"," So I played soccer and played football right played soccer."
"6916820","6919900"," That was most my major sport I played played it right through college."
"6922120","6926340"," And if you're that if I was never so I was never I was never good enough to be pro. "
"6927960","6932600"," But I was never good enough to be D one either I gotta say something here it wasn't that good."

"6946420","6952380"," They couldn't get a an athletic scholarship right you can only get those at D one schools."
"6953240","6961320"," So I was given a scholastic scholarship that I didn't deserve to play soccer for a college."
"6962180","6969260"," So I played soccer for for a small sub Ivy League school that's how I went through my schooling. "
"6969980","6974880"," And at that level if you're good enough."
"6976080","6982140"," You're you're running 45 minutes and you're going to run another 45 minutes and you likely don't"

"6995920","6999680"," morning I was helping people last night on discord."
"7000980","7004000"," And then of course this morning right right back awake this morning at 630. "
"7004580","7006600"," I think I got five hours of sleep last night."

"7015260","7016620"," I woke him up this morning I think."
"7017180","7019120"," And he like slammed his phone down. "
"7019960","7021580"," So I shouldn't be saying this shit."
"7023760","7028160"," So if you guys see Bork in out and about is my point to see Bork out and about Joe"
"7028160","7032760"," out and about CQ out and about those guys are ranking right now."

"7049420","7054180"," And that begins to wear off as we head into end of month into Friday. "
"7055580","7058820"," So it looks like they're parking the bus on us here into the close today."
"7061120","7064820"," They're steady the steady quiet and the market right."
"7066840","7070660"," They got some fat old white guy and he's got his spreads on right now. "
"7070660","7071760"," And he's got a team."
"7072620","7074440"," He's got a good not."
"7074960","7076040"," He's got a team. "
"7076820","7079800"," And then like just a little bit more a little bit more zero date puts."
"7081180","7085420"," We can't tell anybody we're doing that little more zero date calls over there."
"7085420","7088840"," And you got dealers over here going. "
"7088840","7089980"," How do we get out of this trade?"
"7115340","7116220"," All right."
"7118580","7120080"," Three minutes into power hour."
"7121760","7123060"," You know my take here. "
"7123160","7124440"," I think we pin this into clothes."
"7124740","7126440"," We might have some weakness on Friday."
"7127520","7130680"," I'm looking for a dip to buy for the first half of March. "
"7131680","7134540"," I've got a hedge on the market right now to March 28."

"7460720","7462640"," I think it was earned."
"7463040","7463420"," I would want."
"7463700","7466020"," He probably was wearing it like a badge of honor, right?"
"7466260","7467420"," He's probably still right now. "
"7486100","7498120"," Oh, let me read"

"7510100","7513540"," I want to know if Chase is going to hold into Friday or not."
"7515640","7519480"," There was a moment for him, I think, to get out of his trade earlier this morning. "
"7520400","7524060"," We brought that up for him and I'm hoping that he's okay."
"7533160","7534860"," I don't know if he's here right now."
"7534900","7536200"," He's probably pretty fucking pissed. "
"7536620","7537660"," I would be fucking pissed."
"7537980","7538400"," I'll be honest."
"7539640","7541340"," I hate fucking losing, man. "

"7549220","7550180"," It's hard to say."
"7550320","7555360"," The ones that really bugged me are like the ones where I know better."
"7555700","7557680"," I think of the ones that are really fucking irk me the most. "
"7557920","7561140"," If I take a good trade and it fails, I'm usually okay."
"7562040","7567860"," If I trade like five or six grand and I knew that I shouldn't have taken that trade and I"
"7567860","7570020"," did it anyways, I get fucking pissed."
"7571180","7572700"," I've done that on this show. "
"7572980","7579700"," You've seen me on this show knowingly know I'm going to get fucking annihilated."
"7580520","7582200"," I don't mind cutting my losses."
"7582680","7583900"," That kind of stuff I'm fine with. "
"7584000","7584660"," It's what I'm like."
"7585440","7586040"," That's it."
"7586160","7586560"," I'm fucking. "
"7586940","7588400"," I'll let them burn until the close."
"7589140","7590640"," That shit gets me."
"7592720","7594560"," It'll mess up my whole night, too. "
"7594860","7596020"," I can't get over it."
"7603880","7607300"," I'm like when I post to you guys like don't take this trade with me."
"7607300","7608700"," I know they work a lot. "
"7609520","7613520"," But they're not I'm being serious when I say that shit because I know what I'm doing."
"7613520","7616460"," I know what I'm doing is extremely risky."
"7620900","7623360"," Are we going to get the creepy crawly up the wall today?"
"7624000","7624760"," That's what I want to know. "
"7625820","7627300"," Three eleven right now."
"7627360","7632540"," I'm going to look up some music here just in case we get the creepy crawly up the wall on"
"7632540","7633280"," a Friday."
"7633520","7637280"," It looks like it's setting up that sometimes they like to park the bus, right?"
"7637500","7640100"," Just ping a sideways like right where we are right now, right?"
"7640720","7644180"," What I would expect here is this bullshit. "
"7645580","7652160"," You know, this nonsense right here right until fucking four p.m. And then possibility of some kind"
"7652160","7655480"," of creep up there and like the last minute or something like that."
"7656740","7659580"," This is a lot of times with spreads, man."
"7660400","7664620"," If we're going down into the end of a month or if we're going up into another month or even"
"7664620","7666900"," quarter that last fucking few minutes. "
"7667680","7669900"," You'll see a blast up or down."
"7670700","7673200"," You guys were here with me one day on stream."
"7674360","7676980"," You guys were here with me one day on stream, right?"
"7676980","7677580"," Oh, shit. "
"7677720","7678620"," I just deleted a bunch of stuff."
"7678700","7679260"," Oh, all right."
"7679600","7680740"," You guys were here with me one. "
"7680940","7683100"," There was one month where I was here with you guys."
"7684020","7691440"," And I had us going down like 30 points for the last day, right?"
"7691640","7693980"," I was like, we're going down 30 points today, Garin fucking dude."
"7695080","7704840"," And we did we held until like three fifty eight and we literally blasted 30 points down the"
"7704840","7708680"," last five minutes or last minute or two minutes. "
"7708680","7710680"," We went straight down to the depths of hell."
"7712000","7713440"," Do you guys remember that day?"
"7714240","7715080"," Some of you do."
"7715260","7717640"," Some of you have brought it up and said, I remember that fucking day. "
"7717940","7719760"," It was a month end."
"7720040","7722600"," It was like three fifty eight in the afternoon."
"7723080","7729700"," It might have been like three fifty three or something, but we went 30 points straight one or two"
"7729700","7729960"," minutes. "
"7731300","7733520"," Do you remember that that day was fucking crazy."
"7734740","7737060"," I think I closed my puts too before it happened."
"7737260","7738960"," I don't think I was I don't think I was inputs. "
"7739560","7743400"," I think I was inputs and then I closed them and I got squeezed out into the end."
"7743820","7744880"," But I don't remember."
"7745300","7750060"," It was I think this was February of March or of twenty three, maybe. "
"7751240","7752860"," February or March twenty three."
"7753000","7756860"," I'm not positive, but it was one of those fucking one of those in the months."
"7758140","7759860"," Yeah, they went to like fifteen bucks. "
"7760120","7760720"," It was insane."
"7761780","7762880"," It was insane."
"7769100","7771480"," I didn't remember where they stayed on the stream. "
"7771780","7772100"," I was like."
"7773020","7776720"," So I was sitting down the stream and I'm like, I ain't fucking turning the stream off until this"
"7776720","7777360"," shit happens."
"7778180","7778960"," It did. "
"7787260","7789060"," I thought that was insane that day."
"7789320","7790460"," That was a memorable day."
"7791140","7793600"," I wish we should go back and find that video from that day. "
"7793740","7794400"," That was a good one."
"7794780","7796140"," We had another one too, right?"
"7796740","7799300"," We had another one where we were like closure fucking puts."
"7801460","7802920"," There was a big one. "
"7803300","7806440"," That was December of twenty three."
"7807360","7811300"," We were consolidating sideways and we were going to blast down the depths of hell."
"7811300","7815420"," We're going to roll down and we we ended up making the flip up or something. "
"7815420","7819460"," And then we're in the clothes and we're like, no, dude, we're not going down here."
"7819580","7820180"," We're going up."
"7820420","7826460"," I'm just fucking we blasted for like fucking three straight weeks, like a vertical bar straight up"
"7826460","7826740"," north. "
"7826860","7827680"," It was crazy."
"7830980","7832160"," Hold on a second here."
"7832400","7833140"," I'm going to put some. "
"7833360","7834500"," I'm going to put some."
"7834820","7835880"," What do you guys think I should put on?"
"7836080","7838480"," Bull or bear music for the clothes today."
"7839580","7842360"," The end of month where it got two months down. "
"7844300","7846200"," If you want, we can take a look at the."
"7846420","7846820"," How about this?"
"7846960","7847700"," Let's take a look at something."
"7847780","7848600"," We got something cool to look at. "
"7849860","7851620"," I think I'll put the bull music on."
"7851760","7853040"," If we can find some bull music."
"7854120","7857340"," I'll put some bull music on and we'll see what we can find. "
"7860000","7862700"," We're going to look at the JPM Pollard today."
"7864740","7866840"," Let me see if I can find anything that's worth it."
"7866840","7872240"," I don't like that. "
"7872780","7881140"," I don't like that."
"7881140","7881920"," Ooh, that's crazy."
"7884720","7885780"," It's like fucking. "
"7887480","7888960"," Fucking bulls are just like."
"7891680","7892860"," We own this market."
"7899240","7900520"," Bull's own in the market right here. "
"7902080","7903020"," Some D and B."
"7909900","7912680"," We got the bulls closing out another kick ass month."
"7912840","7914580"," Let's take a look really quick at."
"7918200","7919640"," Let's take a look really quick. "
"7919640","7921100"," Should I do it on my screen or maybe?"
"7923660","7925400"," This might be the best place to show it."
"7936490","7939130"," Let's take a look at the seasonality chart."
"7940490","7944930"," I post these once a week for pro traders. "
"7951950","7961910"," Let's take a look at that"
"7961910","7962450"," really quick."
"7967410","7971210"," Right here we've got the JPM Pollard trade."
"7971590","7975350"," We always want to look at these things and just see past history. "
"7975350","7977850"," Not guaranteed we're going to get to that same past history."
"7977850","7979250"," We'll always take a look here."
"7980530","7985310"," When we pop the collar, what happens in its relation to time. "
"7986250","7987930"," Here's an example back here."
"7988910","7990350"," This is August, September."
"7990570","7993250"," We ended up trading down into the end of that pop collar. "
"7994590","7995670"," This is November."
"7996110","7998010"," We traded down into the end of this collar."
"7999010","8000930"," Pop the collar here, trade it down. "
"8002130","8004170"," Pop the collar here, trade it down."
"8004910","8014050"," We did not pop the collar and trade down on Q1 of 2024."
"8015170","8017270"," We're just getting started here, right?"
"8017390","8018350"," I'm popping this collar. "
"8019810","8021770"," We know that we have seasonal weakness."
"8022990","8026350"," Question becomes, do we start it right now, which we haven't done, right?"
"8026490","8029150"," We had a divergence there or do we have one last squeeze?"
"8029990","8034230"," And then start our way down into the end of quarter for the end of March."
"8035090","8036870"," That becomes the big question. "
"8038670","8045290"," Any of you with pro trader subscriptions know that my thoughts here are that we trade up into that"
"8045290","8049490"," 5.25 and then come back down right there."
"8049810","8056970"," That would preserve the 5.015 or any kind of a seasonal back test."
"8057410","8060050"," So I want to show you guys this real quick right here. "
"8060230","8061550"," So we're right back there."
"8063190","8065890"," I'm going to move this over right here so you can see that."
"8066030","8067790"," I'm going to draw in a quick box right here, right?"
"8070570","8072370"," We're looking right there, right?"
"8072550","8074390"," We're going to make this really simple old school, right?"
"8074630","8075870"," This is old school trading, right?"
"8077010","8079030"," Some of you guys know this, some of you guys don't. "
"8079210","8080750"," We have a decline like this, right?"
"8080910","8081830"," We have what's called the trough."
"8083670","8085210"," Come back up here, right?"
"8085510","8089090"," Back test to make sure that's the way that we're going right there."
"8089930","8093550"," We come up higher and what happens here, right?"
"8093750","8094170"," Do you see it?"
"8095390","8101750"," So if we do have a correction or a pullback and we come back down to test this, we don't"
"8101750","8106470"," want to give up this previous high right here. "
"8106530","8107750"," All this stuff, right?"
"8108310","8111310"," Even if there's a brief, oh no, the market's going to crash."
"8111310","8112670"," We're going to the depths of hell here."
"8112950","8116710"," You guys are all beared up down here and we recover. "
"8118230","8125270"," If we don't recover, we will actually retest this whole low down here."
"8125850","8128390"," Way down here, usually, not always."
"8129050","8130250"," We'll retest this one first. "
"8131090","8132230"," Do the first low that you check."
"8132710","8134050"," I guess I'm drawing this kind of shittily."
"8135950","8136850"," Pull out here. "
"8137590","8140150"," There we go."
"8141230","8144210"," So the idea of being here is that we're going to retest this stuff down here."
"8144230","8146650"," You're going to get all beared up for a blast down, right?"
"8146950","8148730"," To then test this level. "
"8149610","8152710"," Big old squeeze up here and then come back down to 3500."
"8153250","8155070"," I know these bears are wanting this, right?"
"8155310","8159730"," They're likely you're going to hear everybody unfint to it on whatever this is right here."
"8160790","8163890"," And they will be in here telling you we're going down to the depths of hell. "
"8163890","8166630"," Rather than just taking that trade, right?"
"8167010","8169290"," So you take trade, close it, you wait until you're underneath."
"8169630","8170970"," And then you take that trade, right?"
"8171730","8180570"," So we probably have some more upside to go as my point to preserve this entire structure."
"8181110","8184970"," So it's not that we won't, like there's bears here that are like, fuck you, we want to get"
"8184970","8187510"," underneath that right now and start that process, right?"
"8188530","8192490"," Buyers are like, nope, we're going to make this stupid up here. "
"8192490","8198570"," And then whatever that back test is, that trough check is no lower."
"8198850","8199490"," Does that make sense?"
"8200110","8202549"," Maybe a little dip down and then that B-shape recovery."
"8203170","8205150"," And we're off and running where?"
"8206290","8207950"," To the right and up. "
"8208370","8214950"," To the right and up."
"8217510","8221610"," Someone posted that to me as a reply yesterday."
"8221610","8224049"," Because that's what I used to say to you guys, right?"
"8224549","8225990"," To the right and up. "
"8228250","8235230"," So if he just wants a bigger view here, simplified for a trader, there you go, you have it."
"8242450","8245969"," Dude, I don't know what's up with this chat box."
"8246209","8247690"," There it goes, back up and running again. "
"8247690","8248930"," Get that chat box running."
"8252610","8255129"," That's right, get that chat box to saucy again."
"8260309","8262530"," Nice little grind into the clothes here. "
"8263510","8266809"," I'll extend these bars over here for you so you can see them again."
"8267070","8268070"," We already broke through that one."
"8268209","8269389"," We got this one back here. "
"8269389","8276139"," I got that one right there."
"8284379","8286760"," We'll type this in up here morning high."
"8296889","8298709"," That's your morning high right there. "
"8300290","8303230"," And then we'll look back, I'll snap one more."
"8303450","8304389"," Up there it is right there."
"8305490","8307090"," Okay, so we got the morning high. "
"8312049","8316570"," This is the market high, previous market high right there."
"8322780","8331230"," I think we used to call this the Hendrix line or something like that."
"8331450","8333270"," I think back in the day we called it the Hendrix line. "
"8334770","8337469"," How do I, it's not allowing me to type?"
"8337990","8338430"," Okay."
"8340910","8342830"," It's going to be spelled wrong, I apologize."
"8344450","8345910"," I'm not putting you in there. "
"8346490","8347490"," We'll just hide it up there."
"8350770","8352530"," It's telling me to get fucked right now."
"8353049","8354430"," It's like you're too much computing. "
"8360580","8362740"," Do we get the creepy crawly up the wall?"
"8366820","8369760"," If you ever want to support what we do here."
