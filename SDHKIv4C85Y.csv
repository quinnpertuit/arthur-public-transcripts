"SDHKIv4C85Y","0","2000"," Check one two, Mike check."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","19280","24280"," Mike check, baby. It is the holiday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","31000","34000"," Around."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","36000","38000"," Save that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","45000","47000"," Some weird stuff."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","54000","56000"," What is going on?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","60000","62000"," What the fuck?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","65000","67000"," What is going on?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","68000","70000"," I don't know what is going on."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","72000","75000"," All right, I got a YouTube's all jiggy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","75000","77000"," Hey, what's going on out there?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","77000","79000"," How's everybody doing?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","79000","81000"," I see you guys out there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","81000","82000"," Good morning, everybody."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","82000","84000"," How are y'all doing?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","85000","88000"," This is cut right to the chase here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","88000","91000"," I need a couple of things I got to do here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","93000","95000"," I got some work in the background before you go."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","95000","97000"," I'll hold on a second."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","106000","108000"," What's going on out there?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","108000","109000"," How are y'all doing out there?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","109000","111000"," Happy Thanksgiving."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","111000","114000"," Or happy holidays, whatever you celebrate."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","115000","117000"," The digits people day, I think they have that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","117000","120000"," But whatever it is, you celebrate if you're from Europe or somewhere else."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","120000","123000"," You may not celebrate Thanksgiving, but the states we do."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","123000","126000"," So we're going to get right into it here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","126000","129000"," Good morning."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","129000","131000"," Hope you're all doing well."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","131000","136000"," We'll take a look at yesterday's clothes and that kind of stuff."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","136000","138000"," How it impacted today."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","138000","140000"," That kind of stuff."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","140000","142000"," So we'll take a look at what's to expect."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","142000","146000"," I want you all to let me put this up on a couple of things here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","146000","148000"," This is this 4550."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","148000","150000"," We've been talking about this level, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","150000","151000"," We can't pair and tag this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","151000","157000"," Nobody's business came back down bounced on what could be considered support."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","157000","161000"," Now there's a little bit of a gap down here that could be closed up."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","161000","168000"," And then still hold that support to come back up here and keep tagging this 4575."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","168000","171000"," But this 4550 down here is now technically support."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","171000","174000"," Unless we begin to reject underneath it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","174000","176000"," And that would mean if you look at this right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","176000","178000"," So let's say you see this one right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","178000","182000"," You'd be looking for the rejection, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","182000","184000"," So it's a good, good teaching."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","184000","186000"," Very simple thing for you to learn."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","186000","188000"," Get your papers and pens out at home."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","188000","189000"," Whatever it is you have at home."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","189000","190000"," Take this note down."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","190000","192000"," It's an important thing for you to learn."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","192000","193000"," So if you don't already know it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","193000","197000"," So I always find it hard to describe this on fin to it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","197000","199000"," And this is a better medium to describe this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","199000","205000"," But what you're looking for here is when we come into some support, okay?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","205000","206000"," We're going to talk about support."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","206000","208000"," If you're a seller, okay?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","208000","211000"," Not resistance, but support."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","211000","213000"," So let's say you're selling this over here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","213000","215000"," You take the money and run down here, okay?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","215000","217000"," You should be taking the money like here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","217000","219000"," Because we could bounce directly off, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","219000","221000"," So you just take that money off here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","221000","223000"," Now let's say you're like, well, fuck you, Kappa."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","223000","227000"," I want to be, you know, bloodbath in it down here and stuff like that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","227000","232000"," The one thing that I want you to address here is, you know, even if you come down here,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","232000","235000"," let's say we swoop down and took this out."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","235000","237000"," It's not really the trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","237000","239000"," The trade was right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","239000","241000"," This is the trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","241000","242000"," How do we bounce right here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","242000","244000"," They'd start taking your money away from you, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","244000","246000"," So this is the actual trade right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","246000","248000"," That's the trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","248000","255000"," Now, if you want to extend that trade, normally what will happen is if we're going to continue"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","255000","258000"," to go down, we'll blast through."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","258000","262000"," And can I just erase this?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","262000","264000"," Yeah, there we go."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","264000","267000"," We'll blast through, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","267000","270000"," And you'll see the rejection."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","270000","271000"," You'll see this rejection."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","271000","274000"," You're still not putting on a short, second short."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","274000","277000"," You're actually looking to break below."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","277000","280000"," So one, two, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","280000","283000"," And then you break below this previous low."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","284000","290000"," Now, you put your finger on SQQ over here or some SDOW or, I don't know, shorting spy"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","290000","291000"," or spoons, whatever."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","291000","296000"," You set it up right where you'll say you're selling not puts or anything."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","296000","298000"," Let's say you want to enter puts that would work too."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","298000","301000"," But let's say you wanted to enter for this next leg."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","301000","305000"," You wait until you get the double, single or double tap."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","305000","309000"," And the key point here is that you break below these two previous lows here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","309000","311000"," And then you can jump right on board and continue down."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","311000","312000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","312000","315000"," So you have to be like tactful in what you're going to do."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","315000","320000"," Another thing to be aware of specifically where we are right now is is where's that hourly"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","320000","321000"," trigger in here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","321000","324000"," Now, it's not showing up right here, but we know where it is."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","324000","327000"," So the hourly trigger on SPX right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","327000","329000"," Is."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","330000","334000"," Force five, two, four."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","334000","335000"," So."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","335000","351000"," Well, I'm just thinking it's right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","352000","357000"," In tight here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","357000","360000"," Right there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","360000","362000"," So that's like the red line right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","362000","363000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","363000","365000"," So I want you to keep, keep your eye on this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","365000","367000"," So."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","367000","371000"," The idea here is that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","371000","373000"," So you come back down here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","373000","376000"," We start to reject and you see that rejection boom right there, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","376000","379000"," You take the short, you know, you've got the gap to close."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","380000","381000"," Right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","381000","384000"," And you're then looking for this move down below here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","384000","387000"," And you're still on trend to the upside."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","387000","394000"," I want to make a key key key point here is that even if you go down here, you're still on an uptrend."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","394000","400000"," If you want to get actually bearish, like bearish, like we're selling this, this move."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","400000","404000"," You need to then be underneath this one right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","405000","409000"," So currently where that sits is that a."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","409000","411000"," Forty five, twenty four."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","411000","414000"," So if you want to get bearish."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","414000","416000"," Right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","416000","419000"," I spoke that wrong."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","419000","422000"," It's underneath this level right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","422000","423000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","423000","426000"," So, so bulls are still in control even all the way down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","426000","427000"," So be aware of that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","427000","428000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","428000","431000"," And keep those, keep these, keep these numbers."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","431000","434000"," Write these down, whatever you need to do for right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","434000","437000"," And I'll show you how these things correspond now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","437000","441000"," Saying that currently we're forming support right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","441000","444000"," On this, on this gamma node right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","444000","445000"," And this forty five fifty."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","445000","449000"," And if we start to form that base down here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","449000","451000"," This is the inverse of a bearish."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","451000","452000"," This is right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","452000","455000"," This right here is an inverse right now of this down here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","455000","456000"," To blast down."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","456000","459000"," So we're kind of consolidating to make another move higher."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","459000","464000"," And you can't get bullish for forty six hundred now, which is right up here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","464000","466000"," This white box."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","466000","468000"," Until you get above."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","468000","471000"," This previous high right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","471000","475000"," And then you can take that trade with, with a lot of confidence."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","475000","477000"," That's that same trade under here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","477000","479000"," A lot of confidence in here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","479000","481000"," A lot of confidence up in here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","481000","482000"," Now you can day trade this stuff."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","482000","485000"," You can come down here, trade this, trade this, trade this, trade this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","485000","488000"," Until you get a break, either underneath or a break above."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","488000","489000"," And take that trade up there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","489000","493000"," But this is consolidation or distribution going on right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","493000","496000"," So right now, this looks like consolidation for a move higher."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","496000","499000"," It doesn't look like consolidation for distribution at this point."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","499000","502000"," This looks like consolidation for another leg higher."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","502000","505000"," Or at least another attempt to fail to get the high."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","505000","507000"," This would be just like upside down, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","507000","510000"," With these two, these two right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","510000","512000"," You come up here, if you inverse that, you come up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","512000","517000"," And if you fail to get that new high right here, that's pretty fucking bearish, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","517000","522000"," And you're going to actually expect us to sell off that if you fail to get that new high."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","522000","529000"," So if you're, if you're a bull right now, what you're looking for is a bull for continuation."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","529000","531000"," Hold on a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","531000","534000"," Confirmation from OPEC plus members here is Russia and Saudi Arabia."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","534000","536000"," Say they are in agreements and delayed me."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","536000","537000"," I got to turn this show."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","537000","544000"," So if you're a bull, you can, you can day trade this stuff here, but you're really looking for a new high."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","545000","548000"," You see that new high from this previous high right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","548000","553000"," And then you're going to be looking to tag this next node above to that 4600 up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","553000","554000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","554000","555000"," Now does that happen all today?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","555000","559000"," Probably not, but we'll talk about it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","559000","564000"," And we'll take a look at what to expect."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","564000","568000"," So this is a spy and we'll look at yesterday and today."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","568000","573000"," And we talked yesterday about if we're above this node right here, we start getting bullish, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","573000","575000"," And we got up there, didn't we?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","575000","577000"," And bought some calls yesterday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","577000","583000"," We came up here and I didn't expect us to get above this on the open."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","583000","589000"," I expected us to squeeze up here and maybe come back down, consolidate, then maybe make a move up higher."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","589000","590000"," Now, what do we do?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","590000","595000"," We camp here before the bell and we got that, that by in the morning and we went straight up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","595000","601000"," Tag that R3 and now we're down here consolidating to decide what we're going to do next."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","601000","606000"," So as of today, this red box, by the way, is that we're just closed tomorrow."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","606000","613000"," I also want to bring to your attention that we have a half a day on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","613000","615000"," So I'm going to write that in up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","615000","620000"," We have a half day on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","620000","623000"," So if you're not aware of that, I want you to become aware of it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","623000","626000"," If you didn't know that some of you probably know that we're open on Friday,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","626000","628000"," but you might not know that it's only a half day."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","628000","630000"," It's been right half day over here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","631000","634000"," And then what's the expectation from here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","634000","637000"," This is that gamma node, this yellow box over here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","637000","638000"," Let me get rid of that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","638000","640000"," This yellow box on spy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","640000","641000"," This is that gamma node."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","641000","644000"," This is that 4550."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","644000","648000"," And this is that 4575 up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","648000","652000"," So what you're going to do here is you're going to buy these dips, which they did, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","652000","654000"," Buyers stepped in and bought."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","654000","656000"," They bought again, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","656000","660000"," So every time we're down here, you're going to buy these dips to trade and attack this"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","660000","661000"," node up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","661000","667000"," So this is that ping pong trade sideways move and we begin to get bullish for 4600 above"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","667000","673000"," the 45 4600 and SPX to start trading above this here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","673000","677000"," And what are we looking for up here is that, what is it?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","677000","678000"," 47."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","678000","680000"," Hold on a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","681000","684000"," One quick second."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","684000","691760"," We're looking for on this on spy after that R3, excuse me, after the R3 for STXL is going"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","691760","697000"," to be the previous high or near the previous side from this past summer."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","697000","701000"," And that was at what was that at 45 793."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","701000","709000"," So we'll put a target up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","710000","711000"," That's the target."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","711000","712000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","712000","714000"," That's STX up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","714000","719000"," So we see they can go back over here as a one minute chart."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","719000","723000"," And this is where your next node is to the upside right up in here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","723000","726000"," We've got a large node up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","726000","729000"," So you're just buying this dip down here, buying this dip down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","729000","732000"," You already know that there's going to be some resistance in here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","732000","734000"," So I'm going to draw that in for you next."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","734000","738000"," I'm going to draw this one right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","738000","743000"," This one's going to be, we're going to make this one yellow down here and hold on a second"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","743000","744000"," here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","744000","750240"," We'll just get rid of this right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","750240","756320"," So this is the top of the market right now, until we get people buying more calls, expanding"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","756320","760200"," the call, like loading up on calls, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","760200","762320"," This is the top right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","762320","766760"," And we already know that there are, that there's not a lot of trading going on, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","766760","775360"," So to expect a new like, like a call wall to come out today, Friday, highly unlikely."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","775360","779360"," Now next week, week after, we can get another call wall."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","779360","780480"," Right now there, this is it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","780480","781920"," This is basically, it's not it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","781920","784760"," There's other walls above it, but this is the main one up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","784760","793800"," So the expectation into Friday, the top should be up here as long as this holds right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","793800","797080"," That should be the direction that we go, okay?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","797080","799640"," Now do I think that we're going up there?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","799640","804320"," You know, we came up here already, we got up here, we got pretty high right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","804320","805880"," So I'm not too keen on it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","805880","807880"," I'll enter date, day, trade this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","807880","809640"," And this has actually moved up a little bit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","809640","812280"," So this is right up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","812280","814360"," That's that 4,500 node."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","814360","818920"," So the idea here would be that you were attacking this up here, and if we begin to break underneath"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","818920","823520"," this over here, then we're going to start heading down, close that gap on SPX, go down"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","823520","829760"," there, maybe even tag that, tag that lower node, and maybe even start to sell this market."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","829760","833640"," So if you're a bear and you want to start selling the market, you need to get underneath"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","833640","840800"," this over here, and this will bring up, this is also the hourly trigger right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","840800","844800"," So I'm going to quickly go back over there and show you that that SPX want to bring up"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","844800","850040"," spy for you really quick and show you where that is, and you can see it on book map right"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","850040","851040"," here too."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","851360","853240"," Too hard to see on book map."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","859400","862120"," Yeah, I want to show you where that hourly trigger is."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","862120","865640"," It's that 45352."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","865640","868920"," So here, we'll actually bring this down a little bit in a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","873400","875600"," Right there, it's right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","875600","880200"," OK, so you watch this bottom of your screen over here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","880240","882080"," This is where support is."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","882080","888600"," And if we start to break down in here and reject, we're going to expect that downside"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","888600","895360"," move, close that SPX gap stuff and maybe even reverse trend to go to the downside here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","895360","896800"," So if you're a bear, that's what you're looking for."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","896800","900680"," You're looking for that break of this green bar right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","900680","905200"," Now, what are my expectations into Friday would be the question, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","905240","909400"," And my expectation in a Friday is we're up from here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","910920","912440"," And I talked to you about this yesterday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","912440","917000"," I said to you, expect this move into Friday that slams up into that 460."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","917360","918600"," I didn't know how long it would take."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","919000","921640"," I didn't know if it would take one, two, three days to get there, but I do expect"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","921640","926200"," us to trade that 460 into Friday clothes, maybe."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","926640","928320"," Now, there's a caveat to this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","929680","933080"," If we do it now, right, if we maybe we already did it, it's even possibly"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","933080","933560"," already does."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","933560","935760"," Let's say this was the top right here, okay, the week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","936560","941640"," It's possible, but regardless, what I do want to, what's most important about"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","941640","947920"," this is that let's say we do this move into Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","948440","949040"," No big deal."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","949040","949800"," That's a, that's good."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","949800","950640"," Checkmark, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","951640","956520"," But if we stay kind of like this, my expectation is that we come into Friday,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","956520","957680"," we're not going to do anything else."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","957680","959800"," It's going to be like, it's going to be like flatten here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","960800","965320"," We'll grind this out and then we'll see a nice, fat drop off into next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","965680","972640"," So if you're a bear right now, if you're, if you're a bear, I have, I hear,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","972720","977200"," well, this morning, I have some close people that I trust bears that I trust."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","977320","978600"," And what's going on here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","978600","980360"," What the fuck is going on down here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","982000","983320"," I don't know what is going on down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","984520","987680"," Now, now traders that I trust, this is kind of a funny thing too."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","987680","996800"," So traders that I trust are already short right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","997160","1008400"," And, you know, if, if, if you can be short here, you can be in, put spreads here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1008400","1010600"," You can be in whatever you want, put back spreads, you name it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1011280","1017360"," What I hate is, uh, I guess, I guess spreads might help you into next week,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1017360","1020120"," but they could help just by the theta burn over the next few days."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1020400","1024440"," The point that I'm trying to make to you is I feel like I can't short this market"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1025080","1029160"," until like we, two rules for me, we get underneath the hourly trigger."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1030080","1034640"," And the second rule, or not a rule, but what's in my brain is that, uh, we're"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1034640","1044760"," likely going to, uh, we're likely going to, um, like go sideways in the Friday"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1044760","1047960"," close and, you know, you're like, you have to put your, like you're short on"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1047960","1049880"," Friday at three 59 or something stupid."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1050640","1052320"," Four 15 or something on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1052320","1053840"," Like we get pinned into Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1054440","1055740"," It's not really going down."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1055740","1058400"," If you're in puts for next week, you're going to get torched."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1058760","1059860"," Put spreads, you'll be all right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1059860","1063160"," There's some people out there that are like, I can take that move up to 4600"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1063440","1066640"," and then catch the role, but I want you to be aware of that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1066880","1072960"," Like between now and Friday that you should expect, uh, or start looking for a"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1072960","1079560"," place that you can handle, uh, you can handle an upside move to four, for 60,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1079560","1084780"," 4600, which I believe is a slightly higher end spy, but that you can handle"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1084780","1088460"," that move higher and then the move down into next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1088500","1091860"," I expect next week to leave a pullback historically."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1091900","1096640"," I want you to all give you a caveat here too, historically the week after"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1096640","1100660"," Thanksgiving, we start to sell the market for about a week to two weeks."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1100700","1102160"," So be aware of that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1102560","1104360"," Now where that is, I don't know."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1104440","1107860"," Like that, that's my point here is, you know, we could, we could spend the next"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1107860","1112720"," two, three days fucking around up here and then we don't get the role until after"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1112720","1113320"," the weekend."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1113320","1117180"," So if you were to do a spread today, let's say you're going to do a spread."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1117220","1121600"," Yeah, you could, you could take out all that, uh, time or if you do like a credit"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1121600","1126220"," spread or something or a debit spread of some kind, you could capture all that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1126220","1128280"," time decay over the week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1128600","1133000"," Well, we got, well, we got today, Thursday, Friday, and then you got Saturday,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1133000","1133880"," Sunday, and then Monday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1133880","1139980"," So you got like five session or five days to torch a bunch of, uh, uh, time"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1139980","1143020"," decay, uh, and, and get, gather all that money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1143020","1148040"," So I expect next week that we begin to sell now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1148280","1153100"," Now, remember what I said, we also need to be underneath that fucking, that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1153100","1153760"," hourly trigger."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1153760","1157520"," So let's say we come into Monday and we keep going up and grinding."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1157920","1159280"," And we're above the hourly trigger."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1159280","1162200"," Don't come back to me and be like, Hey, captain, you said we're going to"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1162200","1164660"," start selling that money involves these other things."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1164660","1166680"," You want to see us get underneath that hourly trigger."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1167160","1169920"," And that's like the confirmation that we're going to start heading, heading"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1169920","1173920"," lower and, uh, close out all those gaps down below that island reversal."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1174080","1175400"," And there's something else here too."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1175880","1176960"," I don't know what I want to talk to you about."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1176960","1185560"," And that is, I'm just going to go to SPX again and that is, um, you know,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1185560","1188400"," we're trading one minutes and four minute and five minute charts around"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1188400","1189400"," these parts, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1189400","1197800"," But, uh, if you look on SPX on a four hour chart, uh, what are we looking at here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1197800","1198120"," Right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1198120","1201080"," We're looking at a cup and handle potential cup and handle."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1201520","1203880"," So we got, we got the cup right over here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1205360","1210080"," And you got what normally happens after this is what you get the handle over here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1210080","1210440"," Right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1211320","1212160"," Can we go higher?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1212640","1219400"," So if you're a bear, you know, that four 60, you tee off it or a 4,600, you tee off it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1220000","1222720"," And then I would limit my expectations for downside move."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1222720","1224000"," And that's kind of the point that I'm trying to make."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1224360","1228440"," If you're buying a put spread here and you only get a couple points down here, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1228440","1230440"," it's going to, it's going to be, it's going to be a, it's going to put a hurt"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1230440","1231040"," on you, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1231320","1234960"," So let's look at that really quick and see what we're talking about here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1236480","1238280"," You see where this gamma flip is, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1239000","1241720"," Uh, down below over here, we wrote that one in earlier."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1242160","1246880"," Uh, so, you know, Kent, would you rather take, if you're going to take this one here,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1246880","1249400"," just be, you're going to take that put spread."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1249920","1254160"," I would only be looking for that, that put spread to come down to this, um,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1254760","1257880"," with this, uh, this first, uh, this first gap down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1258280","1259680"," Do I think you get all the way down here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1259680","1260400"," It's possible."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1261120","1264120"," I would be day trading this, this stuff down here, clean all this stuff up."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1264480","1266560"," If you think that's what it's going to be, if you think that it's going to be"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1266560","1269960"," somewhere we come all the way down here, I don't think that's the case."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1269960","1271200"," I think that we only come down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1271760","1275080"," Uh, just, just down here, maybe clean this stuff up and then we're off and running."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1275120","1280080"," You got to remember too, that we can leave behind these gaps."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1280640","1284280"," And if it's the end of the year, I want, I want to let you know that this is,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1284280","1288160"," we're in the end of the year, end of the quarter, that we can, uh, end up leaving"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1288160","1292600"," this shit behind and come back to deal with this shit, uh, after the new year."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1292600","1294280"," So, you know, this stuff gets left behind."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1294280","1296240"," We come back in the, in the new year and take it out."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1296240","1300120"," So if you're a bear, uh, just be, try to be tactful."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1300360","1303320"," If you're a seller, try to be, uh, have stops, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1304000","1310760"," And try to, try to, uh, think about, uh, like, like how deep we're going."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1312400","1313320"," Take the money and run."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1314120","1316560"," If we get underneath and start to reject here and start heading lower,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1317520","1320840"," you can jump back in again for that second trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1320840","1326840"," Remember that hourly trigger is going to be huge for you as a seller, uh, for"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1326840","1329040"," like, for like commitment to the downside."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1329480","1334560"," And even so with that, that, um, that would limit your expectations because"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1334560","1338760"," if that shit gets bought up and it ends up turning into a cup and handle, um,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1338880","1340000"," you're going to get in trouble, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1340000","1343360"," So just be aware as a, as a bear where you need to be, where you need to get"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1343360","1347560"," under and all that kind of stuff, um, and targets and things like that for, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1347560","1348480"," downside moves."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1348960","1350960"," And I do think that we go down next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1351000","1354840"," I think that we're going to go back down, uh, and then come back up for that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1355240","1358440"," 4,600, I don't think we might tag 46."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1358440","1362240"," And I think that I think this, um, this might be like it for Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1362600","1365920"," And even if we do tag 4,600, uh, we're going to sell the fuck out of that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1365920","1370080"," So one way or another, we're going to, we're going to sell that one way or another."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1370520","1375320"," Now that cup and handle that setting up is setting up for an end of quarter."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1375800","1380960"," Uh, believe it or not, uh, 4,800, uh, I know that's shocking to you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1380960","1382440"," So let's say we get this pullback."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1382680","1385160"," So look in your bottom screen down here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1385800","1387240"," You get, hold on a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1389040","1389760"," Bring this up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1391280","1393440"," This is the 46 that PT right there, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1394360","1396920"," And we're so close, you know, it's pretty fucking close, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1397240","1401480"," But my expectation here is that we're going to sell down and then we're going to ramp"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1401480","1406720"," up into December, uh, and possibly take out that 4,800."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1407680","1410320"," So just be aware of that into its down below here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1410320","1414280"," Just be aware of, uh, this move into the end of the year up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1414960","1418760"," Uh, if you're going to trade this, this move up into that 4,800, if you're really"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1418760","1425480"," get your eyes set on that, there are some huge nodes of calls at 4,800 on SPX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1425920","1429400"," There's shit, tons of them and not SPX on spy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1429480","1435640"," SPX has one standing order for an 800 lot sell at 4,800, but spy specifically"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1435640","1441560"," has a shit ton of calls at 4,800 expiring in, uh, the last, uh, expiry of December."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1442160","1443280"," So just be aware of that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1443280","1448040"," And they might not hit it on the, on the 30 for a 29th, I believe this year was the"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1448040","1448680"," last day for them."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1448680","1450080"," I think it's the last day of the market."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1450360","1452520"," It could be the week after or the two weeks after."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1452520","1455080"," So depending on how you're structuring your stuff, if you're just in straight"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1455080","1457800"," want and straight calls, you might need to put a month or two on them."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1458200","1462040"," If you're going to get some call spreads or something, you probably need to put"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1462040","1466440"," an extra at least two weeks on those call spreads, just to see why it's like"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1466440","1470320"," CYA cover your ass in case it takes a week or two, because what they'll try to do"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1470320","1471600"," is kill all those calls."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1471600","1473640"," I want you to know that they're going to try to merge, even if they're going,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1473640","1477680"," even if they hit those calls, all that, that big node up there, that big 4,800"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1477680","1481920"," node on spy at least, you're likely going to see those calls get decimated."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1482400","1485920"," Uh, so you want to be a little bit farther out, so you don't get those calls, get"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1485920","1486360"," wrecked."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1486880","1489800"," Um, you're not getting that data killed, that data burn, all that kind of stuff"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1489800","1490800"," into the end of the end of the year."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1490800","1496120"," So just be aware of it, uh, as you're planning out your, as you're planning out"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1496120","1498800"," your, um, uh, your trades here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1498800","1504000"," So, uh, all in all, all in all, we've got mission is accomplished at this"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1504000","1508280"," point, even if we go to 4,600 mission is accomplished on, you're looking for that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1508280","1514080"," pullback so that we can attempt to take out that 4,800 for, uh, end of year."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1515080","1520640"," On spy or SPX, uh, I should say, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1522840","1523800"," Hold on a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1524840","1525560"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1528600","1530360"," I'm gonna bring this in a little bit here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1532120","1533760"," There's everybody clearing that now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1533760","1534960"," There's some talk out there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1534960","1539440"," I saw people on fin to it yesterday loaded up on VIX calls and they got"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1539440","1541880"," fucking annihilated this morning."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1542040","1546960"," I used to trade VIX and I assure you, whoever was buying those VIX calls,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1546960","1548600"," those fuck, those things are fucking dead."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1549040","1552040"," Uh, VIX is, you want to be an exacting trader, man."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1552040","1556880"," You trade VIX, VIX is VIX is when people say VIX is broken, it's because it's not"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1556880","1557840"," an easy thing to trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1557840","1561520"," So, um, I was looking at the VIX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1561520","1565400"," There's some Contango with VIX right now and we can easily, I, I, I pointed"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1565400","1568720"," toward you towards March, I believe of this year."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1568720","1574280"," And I showed you how VIX can grind sideways up or down slightly and the"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1574280","1576680"," market can just grind up into the right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1577440","1580680"," Uh, and not, we don't get like 30 points on VIX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1581120","1587360"," So, uh, so you might be tempted to buy VIX calls for the VIX, uh, hit low this"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1587360","1590760"," morning, uh, not the low, but hit a low this morning."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1590760","1592120"," Let me take a look at it where we're tagged."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1592120","1599480"," Yeah, it was almost a pin strike."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1600560","1602640"," I was looking for $12.85."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1602640","1604040"," It was slightly higher than that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1604480","1610680"," And the next, the next level down for VIX is, uh, $12.73."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1611520","1617720"," So if we go to like 1273 on VIX while taking out for, uh, for 60, that's on the"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1617720","1618080"," table."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1618080","1620720"," VIX is showing that right now that we can easily do that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1621200","1624320"," Uh, so VIX isn't, to me, anyone that's out there saying, I see people on"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1624360","1627200"," Fintuit saying you buy the, or, uh, buy the VIX here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1627920","1628560"," I guess so."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1628640","1633840"," Um, but like, I, I think you, I think we can easily take VIX down to, I think I"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1633840","1635920"," said 12, 1273, let me check."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1638560","1638760"," Yeah."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1638760","1644280"," 1273 is easy, easy, this is, there's room here is my point on the VIX, uh, for"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1644280","1646440"," us, for the VIX to continue to go down for the rest of this week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1646440","1649520"," So I don't know, it depends on how you're going to, you're going to, you're"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1649520","1655120"," going to, um, you're going to plan this, uh, this roll over that we expect to happen"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1655120","1656880"," here into next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1659840","1661640"," That is the sound the dragon makes."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1663000","1665720"," Do I think the same for cues and IWM?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1665720","1668000"," So there's a rotation going on."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1668000","1668640"," It's a good question."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1669440","1671600"," There's a rotation going on right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1671760","1674360"," That's kind of discombobulated."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1675080","1679440"," Like I was looking at, um, today or this morning, I was looking at John"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1679440","1680080"," Deere, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1681160","1685440"," And there's a rotation out of us, like this, John Deere is a great fucking"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1685440","1686040"," example."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1686800","1691200"," Uh, there's a rotation going on in and out of, uh, let's look at a couple of"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1691200","1693800"," these stocks from like a few, all right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1693800","1697640"," We don't have to look at it on your own look at a company like John Deere on a"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1697640","1699360"," daily chart over the course of a year."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1700880","1703120"," That shit's never come back down from COVID."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1703120","1703480"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1704520","1707680"," Now they're cycling out of John Deere."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1708320","1708640"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1708640","1711280"," Even even if it gets bullish for the next week or two, they're cycling out of it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1711760","1714600"," But then you look at a company, let's say, like Tyson Foods, or you look at a"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1714600","1716600"," company like Budweiser, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1717000","1719760"," And they're cycling into those tickers right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1720600","1721920"," So there, there's like that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1721960","1726240"," There's a, um, there's a rotation, but it's not a full, it's not, it's weird."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1726240","1730640"," Sam, you see this week said, uh, expect the, like, expect, like, don't be, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1730640","1731840"," looking at individual tickers."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1731840","1735760"," And I'm like, we're doing that and fucking now are in a Dow Jones right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1736120","1739800"," They're literally still rotating out a bunch of COVID stocks and Dow Jones"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1740120","1743800"," and rotating into some stocks into the Dow Jones industrial average."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1744080","1749560"," And I think that might be the, uh, that might be the same for, uh, IWM and, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1749560","1753960"," specifically, I think you do see a rotation out of tech and S and P 500"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1753960","1758560"," into next week, you may find individual tickers in the next week in Dow Jones"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1758560","1761400"," industrial average and an IWM that are fine."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1762160","1766920"," Whatever that pullback is, though you should see it play out still."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1767600","1773560"," Uh, in the, in, in the wider market in IWM and the cues, you should see that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1773560","1774280"," same pullback."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1774800","1781920"," Uh, if you overlay a chart of, um, uh, IWM, small caps, small craps, small caps,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1782920","1788200"," and, uh, spy, you can, you'll see divergence for like half a day, maybe a day,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1788600","1795120"," but it generally follows the same track as S and P 500 NASDAQ has outperforms"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1795120","1800520"," oftentimes, but it still generally follows the same, uh, even they have outsized"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1800520","1804040"," mood, like outsized down moves and up moves in NASDAQ, but you still have the"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1804040","1806440"," general, it still follows the S and P 500."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1806600","1808760"," Remember S and P 500 is built with tech in it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1809320","1812040"," Um, so it's, it's more breath out of the market."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1812120","1817320"," Of course, DIA has all the blue chip breath too, but, uh, so yeah, do I think"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1817320","1818640"," there's a pullback coming for all of it?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1818800","1819040"," Fuck."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1819040","1819600"," Yeah, I do."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1819600","1820520"," Abs to fucking leave."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1820760","1821040"," All right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1821040","1821360"," I do."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1821360","1825600"," If we get underneath that hourly trigger, uh, and, uh, and, uh, historically,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1825600","1830880"," we have a pullback as well, uh, and the, the call wall is at 46 hundred."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1830880","1833720"," I mean, if I start to list this stuff off to you, think about this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1833720","1834600"," You're a bull, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1834880","1835960"," Start to think about this, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1835960","1839960"," You got the VIX, the VIX is almost that it's, that it's a yearly low right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1840840","1841640"," The, right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1841720","1845080"," It's, you got, uh, the call wall is at 46 hundred."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1845080","1849120"," We just traded 40, uh, 45, 70, I believe 45, 75 maybe."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1849760","1851600"," And, you know, I don't know how to say anything."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1851600","1855600"," You start stacking all this stuff up and it starts to look like, yeah, we're"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1855600","1856600"," going to roll at some point."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1856600","1861560"," So if you're a bull here and you're looking for that trade, like I'm going to roll"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1861560","1864160"," with 25 grand, 50 grand or something, 100 grand."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1864920","1867520"," Just cool off for a little bit, uh, cool off."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1867520","1870520"," And for the next couple of weeks, two, three weeks, sit on your hands, do"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1870520","1876360"," something else and you should see a nice fucking dip by with, uh, in the short"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1876360","1881240"," term, sometime late next week, you should see a, a great place to buy a nice"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1881240","1884240"," low to buy, uh, for that run for December."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1884240","1889360"," So if you're looking for that run for end of December and you're a bull, um, you"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1889360","1891000"," can day trade this up if you want."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1891000","1894200"," You can day trade ping pong and around to 46 hundred if you want."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1894560","1896960"," If you're looking for that big trade, it's likely next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1897320","1901040"," If you're a seller, uh, I'm not going to give you advice on what to do, but for me"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1901040","1904880"," personally, I want to sell this and I'm, I'm waiting for Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1905400","1910960"," I'm hoping that Friday is flat and, uh, or we squeeze up into Friday, one or the"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1910960","1911240"," other."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1911800","1918320"," And we start, we, we take out a short or a, a put into or spread and, uh, dated for"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1918320","1922840"," about two weeks out, um, for the market to pull back for that cop and handle to show"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1922840","1923240"," itself."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1924840","1925600"," You guys can do it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1925600","1928480"," Now you can do whenever you like, I know some of you this morning and that brings"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1928480","1929120"," up another point."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1929120","1931560"," So on, uh, it was kind of funny."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1931560","1934760"," I was on fin twit this morning and someone said, thanks for the shout out."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1934760","1939160"," I went shorts on, uh, on the upper bar up there this more, uh, this morning."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1939520","1942480"," And sometimes they get asked, uh, why don't you trade both sides?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1942520","1945640"," And I thought about it this morning because I was closing a bunch of calls out"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1945640","1948840"," this morning and I was like, you know, I don't have the fucking time here to be"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1948840","1950480"," fucking, uh, buying puts here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1950480","1954680"," Like as we pinged closed my calls and I'm, you know, it's almost like it's"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1954680","1955240"," tiring."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1955560","1956240"," I was like, you know what?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1956240","1957320"," This fucking trade is done."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1957560","1960600"," I got in this trade yesterday that I started DCA into the bell."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1961120","1964640"," You know, and now today I'm like fucking panicking because I got a shit ton of"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1964640","1965280"," money in the line."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1965880","1970720"," And, um, I'm panicking into the open this morning that I'm like, I'm not closing"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1970720","1973520"," these calls because they're for Friday norm for zero dates."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1973520","1975800"," I closed them on the opening bell, but these are Friday calls."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1976360","1979360"," And so I'm holding them in the open, squeeze all over the fuck up on the bell."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1979800","1981160"," And by that point, I'm tired."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1981160","1983640"," I'm like, I feel like I just got done working or something."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1984480","1987520"," So I didn't want to take puts, uh, or even a put spread."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1988560","1991960"," It was more, it's not more like I don't want to, I should like probably should"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1991960","1995240"," have bought some puts, some put spreads for a couple of weeks out on that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","1995240","2000680"," paying up there, even if we went up to 4,600, but, um, you know, I was tired."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2000720","2002920"," It's like, it's like you're doing all this work, doing all this work."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2002960","2006120"," And you finally get paid and you go fucking, I'm just going to fucking chill"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2006120","2008720"," for a minute and let this shit calm down before I take the next trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2010760","2011240"," Good job."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2011280","2011720"," Good job."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2011720","2012400"," Michael JBJ."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2012400","2016280"," So if anybody, if any of you guys did that, if any guys took like a spread up"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2016280","2020480"," there, up there at that top tick, like right up here, if you took a put spread"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2020480","2022520"," up here, uh, you're probably safe."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2022560","2028080"," Even if we go to 4,600, you're likely going to be safe, uh, and make some serious"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2028080","2029360"," money in the next couple of weeks in that trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2029360","2033320"," So if you did that, congratulations to you, uh, you likely took, if you took a"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2033320","2037800"," put spread right up here, you're likely, uh, but you're fucking silent."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2037880","2039440"," I mean, I don't know how else to say it to you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2039680","2042200"," Basically you can come back and double top and take it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2042480","2045040"," You could go up just a little bit more and bounce up there and look for that, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2045040","2046240"," roll back down into next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2046240","2048640"," No matter if you took that put spread up there, whatever you structured it,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2049040","2051960"," congratulations to your set yourself up real nice up there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2051960","2054040"," So, uh, I did this morning."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2054040","2056600"," I was like, I'm fucking done like I'm green for the week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2056640","2057120"," I'm happy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2057560","2060880"," Um, and I'm going to, I'm a little pissy because I got to check back"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2060880","2062640"," and Friday to short this shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2063200","2064400"," And I want to, I want it to be done."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2064400","2065200"," That was your chance."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2065200","2068000"," This was your chance up here this morning to be done for the week right there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2068960","2072560"," Uh, in my view, if you structured your trade appropriately, hopefully"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2072560","2074480"," you can get back up there so we can take that trade again."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2075560","2077480"," Now, the next question becomes, am I bullish here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2078280","2079760"," We're going to look on the 30 minute chart here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2080920","2082080"," Look at that fucking strike."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2085640","2086600"," Oh, hold on a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2090840","2092840"," Uh, it's, it's cool enough a little bit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2094160","2096640"," You know, we're at the zero line on hourly velocity."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2097520","2099640"," Uh, we're not quite topped out on daily velocity."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2099640","2103120"," So I'm, um, I'm passively bullish here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2103760","2105760"," Um, but we're close to a top."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2105760","2110520"," So either either that four seven, uh, 45 70 or that, or that, see that, yeah."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2110520","2113120"," 45 75 or that 4,600."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2113560","2116520"," Uh, you should start to see a topping action in the daily velocity."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2116520","2120000"," And you'd see whatever that next ramp is, it's probably going to be"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2120000","2123840"," done at some point in here and you'll see, you'll see us start to top out."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2123840","2127480"," So that's a nice half hour bar, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2127480","2129360"," They're going to, they bought that bar down there and they're just"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2129360","2130840"," keep buying every half hour in here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2130840","2131360"," They're buying."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2132240","2134880"," So they bought this whole previous half hour and they're buying this"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2134880","2136080"," next half hour right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2138360","2140560"," Bullish baby, bullish."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2143440","2146760"," Let's bring that back over there and see if we can take those two out, take"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2146760","2149120"," out this previous eye and that previous eye over there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2151080","2151380"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2151380","2152600"," So it's Thanksgiving."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2152880","2156120"," Uh, I want to say that if you're watching the stream right now, happy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2156120","2156400"," Thanks."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2156400","2158720"," Given to you, thanks for showing up to the stream."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2159320","2161600"," Uh, thanks for sticking around for the entire year with me."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2161600","2163200"," Thanks for sticking around for three years with me."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2163640","2166160"," Uh, if any guys have been here since day one, I want to say thank you,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2166160","2166400"," Tim."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2166400","2168400"," Very grateful that you're here without that without you people here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2168520","2169520"," I wouldn't have a fucking show."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2170080","2171440"," Uh, so thank you very much."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2171480","2173400"," Uh, I want to get that out right away so I don't forget."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2174320","2178080"," I'm going to go through some of your comments here and see what you guys"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2178080","2178680"," are saying here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2179960","2180520"," I want to say here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2181120","2181800"," Close that up."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2182760","2184520"," Yeah, a couple of things to do here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2187000","2188200"," Hold on here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2189880","2193960"," Uh, I mean, you guys want to see, you guys want to show you the, um,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2194480","2196400"," to show you guys the nodes."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2196800","2198320"," So this is SPX net gamma."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2198360","2203720"," I'm going to show you guys the gamma for, uh, SPX and, uh, the VIX and I"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2203720","2206280"," believe the VIX and, um, uh, tech."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2206280","2209560"," So if you're a tech bull, uh, so this is the 4550 right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2209560","2210440"," You see this one right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2210760","2213440"," As long as we hold this one, uh, right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2213720","2216280"," We come up here and we tag that 4575, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2217160","2220160"," So this is what we did today is we just went, bam."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2220920","2221400"," Hold on here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2221600","2223480"," Let's do it with a white so I can see you guys can see it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2224560","2227520"," So we went from this node right here to this node right here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2228080","2230880"," And now we're back down here, just bouncing around, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2231520","2233080"," Uh, and if you're a bull, what do you want to do?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2233080","2236560"," You want to clean all this stuff out right for end of the month, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2236560","2241680"," Into Friday, um, you're looking to, you're looking to see us, does get up here"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2241680","2244240"," and pin this shit up here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2244240","2245560"," And take out this node up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2246280","2250760"," Um, so that's the ultimate target and then to have a nice pullback over here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2250800","2255120"," Unless we start to buy more calls, if they start buying more calls, right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2255880","2258320"," Uh, next week or so that we can actually see us."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2259800","2262640"," That's 4,900 right there, 4,900."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2262640","2265280"," Whoo, 4,900."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2265680","2266960"," Uh, but we need to see this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2266960","2269520"," We need to see these call nodes push up a little bit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2269520","2271920"," So, uh, that's SPX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2271920","2273600"," And then now I'm going to show you NDX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2274600","2278160"," And, uh, I don't know why it's not showing right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2278440","2279120"," Hold on a second here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2280360","2281680"," It's not showing up for me right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2283480","2287640"," There's SPX about NDX net gamma."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2290040","2291920"," Here's your gamma bars over here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2292080","2294000"," You got another one right here at 14, 900."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2294040","2296520"," You got this one right here at 1600, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2296520","2297920"," This is, uh, your next node."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2298680","2301960"," Your next largest node over here is at, uh, 16, 100."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2302520","2308520"," Your next node over here is 16, 150 and then 16, 200, not a lot of will right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2308560","2313200"," Uh, as you can see, not a ton of will from other bulls on big tech right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2313200","2314920"," There's some will, but not huge."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2314920","2317320"," So these are your two nodes up here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2318080","2321800"," Um, you want to be holding, uh, you want to be holding this"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2321800","2323960"," 1600 key level for bulls."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2323960","2329440"," Hold 1600 on, uh, let me go to VIX and go to the gamma on VIX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2334160","2335520"," We got a node here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2335520","2336080"," Where were we at?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2336080","2337520"," We're trading, uh, 12 right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2337560","2339280"," My guy, we can go all the way down to 11."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2339280","2340280"," You guys can't see this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2340960","2344400"," Uh, we got a node over here at $11 and 50 cents."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2344400","2346960"," Be aware of that 11, 50 down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2347320","2348560"," Here's that $12."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2348560","2351480"," So VIX can go all the way down to 11, 50 mark that on your chart."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2351880","2355920"," We got 11, 50, uh, 12 bucks, 12, 25, but that's a big one down here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2355920","2357040"," 11, 50 is a big one."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2357440","2359400"," Your next largest node is at 14."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2359400","2362600"," So if we get a roll in the next week, you might get 14."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2363120","2364320"," Uh, so be aware of that one."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2364320","2366000"," And then up here, you got a big one up here at 20."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2366320","2372360"," So marking your charts, uh, 20, 14 and 12, excuse me, 11, 50, $11, 50 cents."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2373160","2378160"," Uh, $14 and then $20 on the VIX."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2382520","2385000"," We'll see here, main screen."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2387480","2388480"," Happy Thanksgiving to you out there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2388480","2389280"," We're just joining us."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2389920","2390960"," Happy Thanksgiving to you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2392000","2393360"," Uh, what else do we have here?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2394160","2398720"," Uh, we got the four week auction today next week for economic calendar."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2400080","2403040"," Or I should tell you again, if you're just joining us, we have a half day on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2404720","2407960"," Uh, we have PMI at 945 on Friday as well."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2408640","2410160"," And then Monday, we have nothing."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2410400","2414160"," Oh, we do have, we've got new home sales scheduled on Monday at 10 on Tuesday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2414160","2418560"," We've got the S and PK Shiller home price index, consumer confidence at 10."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2419400","2424000"," Uh, we've got Chris Waller speaking at 10 and then, uh, uh, fed president, uh, Google, uh,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2424040","2429360"," ghoulsby speaking as well at 10 a.m. on Tuesday, Wednesday, we've got GDP, first"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2429360","2432960"," revision, advanced trade, US trade balance, retail inventories, post"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2432960","2436120"," inventories, you got master speaking with the beige book of two p.m."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2436120","2438880"," on Wednesday, Thursday, big data dump."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2439640","2441560"," On Thursday, sets up, that's a target for you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2441560","2445440"," If you're a bear Thursday, we got PC, excuse me, uh, PC."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2446520","2449400"," Pending home sales, personal income, mission claims, uh, jobs claims."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2450960","2455160"," And then Friday, next we've got, uh, ISM manufacturing, uh, auto sales and"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2455160","2458280"," construction spending that was big, but, uh, the big one for Friday, next"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2458280","2459640"," we could be ISM manufacturing."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2460560","2462040"," So that's all I can see for next week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2462680","2468040"," Um, I'll usually give you, uh, I'll usually give you, uh, like if this"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2468120","2469920"," then that, or if that then this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2470000","2477320"," And so on Sunday or Friday or whatever it was into Monday, expectations, that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2477360","2478560"," holds true right here too."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2478560","2480520"," So on this, we will chart right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2483120","2484600"," Right on this, we will try right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2487720","2492120"," Uh, it's said this morning that you're a buyer here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2493240","2494920"," So you're up, this is, this is the hourly trigger."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2494920","2495880"," This is up trend."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2496880","2497640"," Right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2497680","2499000"," So I'm bullish."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2499360","2501240"," We can trade this all we want, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2502360","2504760"," Uh, this is that next gamma gamma node up here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2504760","2507000"," We can trade this up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2508480","2510360"," Uh, but we need to get a boat."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2510360","2512760"," So this node here becomes this node right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2512760","2515880"," So if we can get up here, I get bullish again to this right here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2515880","2516520"," Does that make sense?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2517080","2521680"," Uh, now let's say, let's say today we broke down below this hourly trigger, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2522240","2524320"," Um, then the dip buy would be lower."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2524320","2525040"," Does that make sense?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2525040","2529120"," Or you're buying a dip right here with a stop underneath it, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2529160","2531720"," And if it'll say, you know, there's always risk, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2532040","2534960"," So let's say you're buying this dip down here and it goes against you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2535000","2536640"," You, you, your stops are triggered."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2537000","2539520"," And then your, your dip buy is even lower, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2539600","2541120"," It's, it's down here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2541960","2549400"," Um, so I guess the idea here is I can give you, I can tell you, I can tell you, I guess"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2549400","2554120"," what I can do is I can always tell you, Hey, we're going to 460 by Friday, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2554200","2555560"," We're going to go to 460 by Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2556560","2560640"," Now, if we start to sell, right, let's say you start breaking below the hourly"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2560640","2564160"," trigger and we're not at Friday yet, you have to have a plan, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2564800","2567440"," And you know, it does a really good job of this is a Chris"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2567440","2568960"," DeMarco does a good job of this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2569600","2571840"," And Matt Ryan does a good job of this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2571880","2575760"," And that is, um, I'm a momentum trader, but I'm also a price action trader."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2576320","2579880"," Um, so in regard to some of gamma tells me, I really don't give a fuck."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2579920","2585400"," So like, uh, so think about it like, um, think about it like, um,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2586520","2590280"," I would sell my own brother down the river if I could in the market."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2590320","2595320"," You have to have that, um, you, you have to have that same thesis."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2595320","2597560"," You, as if you, I'm going to say this to you guys."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2597560","2601720"," So if I want to say this to you guys, you guys need to understand this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2601720","2602040"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2602560","2604280"," Write this down if you're a young trader."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2605400","2605760"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2606760","2609240"," And this is going to be one of the tools, this is going to be one of the tools"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2609240","2612880"," that will serve you better than most of them that are out there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2612880","2613200"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2614400","2618280"," This is where, um, Elliott Waiver is getting a lot of trouble for this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2618560","2621280"," They get yelled at, they get yelled at oftentimes because Elliott Waiver is"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2621280","2626200"," based a lot of what they do on, um, uh, on rules, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2626680","2630680"," And, uh, they, then what happens is price doesn't go there, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2630760","2632760"," They, they, they get, they go, it's invalidated."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2632800","2634400"," I have a price starting to 460, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2635040","2638400"," Using Elliott Waiver, we don't get there to 460."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2639200","2641960"," We just start, we're kind of rolling heavy right now, rolling heavy and down,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2641960","2642760"," just like selling."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2643520","2645440"," And I'm an Elliott Waiver and I give you 460."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2645440","2648440"," So I come back and I go, Hey, Captain Jim, you suck."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2649760","2651520"," What do you mean invalidated, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2652000","2658760"," So you're not always getting the full, uh, story from some traders, uh, or from"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2658760","2660680"," people that you're looking towards for guidance."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2660880","2664000"," So my point to you is this, um, if you are"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2664000","2668600"," going to stay alive as a trader or an investor, you're going to stay alive"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2668600","2669680"," as a trader and investor."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2671200","2672880"," What, I don't care if you use Elliott wave."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2672920","2674000"," I don't care if you use gamma."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2674080","2676760"," I don't care if you use, um, VWAP."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2676800","2679080"," I don't care if you use RSI."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2679120","2681240"," I don't care if you're trading."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2681280","2682200"," You fucking name it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2682200","2683040"," I don't care what you're trading."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2683280","2687800"," Whatever system you're using out there, my system, use my system, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2688440","2691640"," Whatever system that you're using out there or the, or the, or the tools"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2691640","2693160"," from systems that you're using out there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2693520","2695240"," I want you to remember something very important."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2695800","2696120"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2697040","2701720"," Um, and it's going to take a lot of hammering over the head for you to learn this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2702000","2705960"," You're going to lose a lot of money before you learn, learn, learn this tool for"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2705960","2706240"," sure."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2708080","2711400"," No matter what thesis you have, no matter what tools you're using, no matter what"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2711400","2713040"," they are, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2713840","2720120"," You have to be able to take the opposite side of your thesis with a drop of a hat."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2721280","2722520"," Wasn't there a movie like this, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2722520","2726240"," I think heat, heat, the movie heat, uh, what was his name?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2726280","2727760"," Uh, Robert De Niro was the bad guy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2727760","2730400"," And he said, I'll, I'll leave in a drop of a hat, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2731640","2734680"," He said, I'll drop everything of the drop of a hat and I'm gone."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2735480","2738520"," You need to have that mentality as an investor and trader."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2739160","2741440"," Uh, and it's a, it's a big tool for you to have."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2741440","2742920"," So let's say you make a plan."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2743120","2745160"," Number one, you know that there's always risk."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2745720","2747960"," Number two, that plan is just a plan."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2747960","2749280"," It can go to shit at any time."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2749440","2750480"," It can go where you want it to go."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2750480","2756440"," Hey, look, it went from, it went from four, four, uh, 50 points, 50 all the way up to"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2756440","2757720"," four, 60 point 50."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2757720","2759640"," That guy's a fucking genius, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2760480","2761600"," Let's say it goes against."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2761800","2762760"," Let's say we start selling."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2763480","2769200"," You have to be able to ship your thesis to price action."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2769960","2774200"," So I want to remember that if price action tells you, especially if you don't"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2774200","2776520"," know other systems of trading, if you don't know everything about Elliott"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2776520","2779160"," wave or don't know anything about gamma or whatever the fucking is you're doing,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2779400","2782240"," you don't understand the canceled stuff for any reason."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2782720","2787080"," If it goes again, if price action goes against your thesis, have the ability to pivot"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2787440","2788640"," and change your thesis."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2789200","2793080"," I used to talk about this more frequently than I do now, but I used to harp on this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2794400","2796080"," Nobody fucking cares."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2796680","2797480"," Listen to me closely."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2798280","2800800"," Nobody fucking cares."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2801480","2801840"," Right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2802360","2804200"," About your fucking thesis, but you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2805240","2805640"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2806200","2809360"," And you're you caring about your thesis is for you to make money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2810440","2811200"," For you to make money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2811280","2813720"," Don't ever forget that ever."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2814720","2816200"," So at the end of the day, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2816480","2820640"," When we're done trading or at the end of the week, you know, the month, the only"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2820640","2823120"," thing that matters, right, is that you're getting paid."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2824400","2826920"," You are the only person paying your fucking bills."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2827240","2830280"," You're the only person taking out your wife, your boyfriend, your girlfriend,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2830320","2831080"," whatever it is."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2831760","2835000"," You're the only person that's responsible for your trading."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2835080","2837040"," And who's responsible for your own money?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2837400","2839720"," Don't ever blame anybody else."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2840080","2840520"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2841120","2843360"," Take personal responsibility for your trading."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2844240","2845200"," And I'm going to tell you why."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2845920","2850800"," You can get on finch with or wall street bets or stock twits or anywhere else out"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2850800","2853920"," there and you drink the Kool-Aid for bulls and bears, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2854400","2855720"," You drink that Kool-Aid, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2856400","2861360"," And you're stuck in a thesis and you have to live and die by that sword for"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2861360","2864240"," internet points, but not real money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2864720","2865480"," Does that make sense?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2866000","2871520"," So you could be a perma bear or a perma bull on, on, on Twitter or wall"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2871520","2872520"," street bets or whatever."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2872720","2873680"," That's all fun and games."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2874040","2877040"," But the truth is this is supply and demand."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2878200","2879600"," We're really in supply and demand."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2879600","2880400"," Where's the supply?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2880400","2881160"," Where's the demand?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2881200","2883880"," Where's the strong and weak supply and demand?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2884760","2885040"," Right."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2885040","2885920"," We go up and down."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2885920","2887000"," This market goes up and down."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2887800","2889760"," And as soon as it goes against you, you have to be able to shift."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2890760","2895560"," So let's say you're a perma bull and you're like fucking Tesla's going to"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2895560","2896760"," five thousand, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2896800","2899760"," And it's, it's, it's burning down to a hundred fucking dollars."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2900560","2903440"," You need to be able to identify that that's going to a hundred goddamn dollars."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2903440","2904800"," You will lose all your fucking money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2904800","2905400"," I promise you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2905800","2907480"," Now you might have internet points."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2907720","2912880"," You might be on Twitter and be like, I'm the biggest Tesla fucking bull ever, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2913400","2914160"," On finch with it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2915560","2917360"," But that doesn't mean you're making fucking money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2918320","2919920"," And that's what we're here to do is make money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2919920","2922240"," So you can be the Tesla bull all you want and finch with it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2922560","2925960"," But I want you to remember that after all that, all that, all that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2925960","2929480"," internet cred that you have means dog shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2930560","2933320"," When it comes to having money in your fucking pocket in the bank to pay your"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2933320","2935680"," bills, and that's why we're here, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2936360","2939520"," So I want you to, I want, if you're a new trader or you're a bull or a bear,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2939520","2944480"," you need to understand that that's more of a function of a like a heel in wrestling."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2944840","2947440"," It's fun to poke around with with bulls and bears and all that kind of stuff."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2947600","2953480"," But in truth, you will learn over time that you're never going to be a bull or a bear."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2954680","2959480"," In reality, you just know where supply and demand is and you trade that or you"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2959480","2960160"," step out of it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2960160","2964000"," You can be a Tesla bull and decide not to go long, but you don't buy every fucking"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2964000","2964440"," Tesla."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2964440","2966840"," Some people say that like I bought a Tesla this and I buy it at the highs and the"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2966840","2967120"," lows."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2967120","2970120"," I don't care that fucking guy that's telling you that he probably has been buying"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2970120","2971920"," Tesla since it was $10."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2972800","2977000"," His trading plan, investing plan is completely fucking different than yours."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2977200","2978040"," You understand my point?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2978400","2981560"," So you might look up to some, got some Tesla bull on Twitter and be like, that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2981560","2985680"," guy says, that guy's, but he's got a million followers and he tells, tells me"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2985680","2988040"," that he buys Tesla on highs, lows, doesn't care."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2988040","2990880"," It's going to $20,000 from a long term investor."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2990920","2992480"," I'm going to fucking tell you it's not goddamn true."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2993400","2996040"," And his, or his or her position is not yours."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2996600","2998760"," They haven't been buying since it was $10."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","2998760","3001360"," You're someone trying to buy a Tesla at a thousand fucking dollars."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3001720","3005440"," And they're probably selling fucking calls against you too, mind you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3005800","3008960"," So you have like motivations of people that you're listening to on, on social"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3008960","3010920"," media are different than yours."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3011600","3014040"," Their goals are different than yours."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3014320","3018440"," And your internet cred doesn't mean shit at the end of the day."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3018960","3022480"," So like, you can suck each other off on the internet all we want, but the truth"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3022480","3028000"," is, and a lot of you know this, I'm a permable, I get done on a Friday and I"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3028000","3031640"," look at my account and I go, fuck, it's at zero, fuck, it's at 20,000."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3031640","3032640"," Was that 100 grand on Monday?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3032640","3037000"," It's not a 20 grand fuck, you know, and you have to live with that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3037280","3040520"," You're the person that's at home beating yourself up with a hammer."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3040520","3044000"," You're the person that's not trading because you're pissed off of yourself"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3044000","3045880"," or the losses that you've encountered and that stuff."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3046320","3047360"," So I want you to remember that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3047400","3047720"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3047720","3052600"," So you must become a price action investor trader to survive."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3052600","3055760"," I don't care if you're a seller or a buyer, whatever you're better at, you"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3055760","3058440"," need to be able to identify where supply and demand is, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3058440","3062760"," And know when to buy a dip and when to sell a rip, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3063000","3064840"," You must, you can, you can hang on to that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3064840","3067760"," I'm a permabair and parable, but you have to understand that when it goes"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3067760","3071080"," against you and your thesis, you rip that shit up and throw it away."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3071400","3072040"," Does it make sense?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3072440","3074520"," So let's say you're a permabair on Fintuit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3075200","3077760"," And let's say you're like crash, crash, crash, crash, crash."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3077760","3079720"," That's all you say all day long, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3080360","3083000"," I want you to know that that's great."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3083640","3086560"," But that's not how you make money, okay?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3087800","3090320"," And you need to be able to separate those two things."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3090440","3094440"," You, you have to be able to separate that bearishness or that bullishness"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3094640","3097760"," and be able to trade price action."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3098440","3102640"," So like if you see, if you see this hourly trigger break and you start"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3102640","3105720"," to see rejecting on it and we're starting to head lower, you need to"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3105720","3108960"," position yourself not to be buying dips there and start looking to sell that"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3108960","3112480"," rip or sell that support that's going to break and wait for something lower."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3112480","3113360"," Does that make sense to you guys?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3113360","3114280"," Oh, you guys, I'll understand that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3118840","3120480"," Yeah, I haven't stressed that in a long time."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3120480","3121400"," I used to harp on it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3121440","3125400"," Nobody give, I guess you care in your brain what Fintuit thinks about you,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3126040","3126960"," but you shouldn't."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3127480","3130120"," Don't give a fuck what Fintuit thinks of you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3130760","3133760"," What you should be really caring about is you making money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3134240","3136080"," And I'll tell you what, you make money, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3136560","3138880"," And that's really the game changer."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3138880","3140920"," You feel more confident, you feel good about yourself."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3141520","3144680"," Um, you feel it's like it's, it's, it's, it's every fucking thing."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3144680","3148280"," You can pick up any trading plan that you want."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3148760","3151400"," You can have any thesis that you want, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3152080","3155600"," You can be a permable or a perm, perma bear on Fintuit, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3155680","3158640"," Or you just stop, if you can't separate through, then just stop being a"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3158640","3160880"," permable or a perma bear, just stop it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3161800","3164880"," Be a trader, be an investor, be a seller, whatever you want to be."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3164880","3166920"," But don't be a bull or bear if you can't separate the two."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3167600","3168000"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3168320","3171200"," And the next thing is you're going to follow price action."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3171200","3175560"," Price action is going to be the truth of your thesis."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3176160","3179840"," So whenever you're entering a trade, right, this is where it all comes together."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3179960","3181920"," This is like the wrapping it up on a gift present for you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3182880","3184760"," So you're no longer a bull or a bear."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3185240","3187160"," You're looking for supply and demand, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3187920","3191080"," Now you're, you're keyed up on that supply and demand, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3191400","3192720"," And you're a price action trader."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3192720","3195920"," So you, you make a plan when you're, when you're going in, when you guys are out"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3195920","3202040"," there, taking a short, taking a put spread, taking a, taking a fly, taking a"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3202040","3204800"," condor, selling and buying, it doesn't matter."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3205120","3208400"," If you're taking long calls, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3208920","3212000"," On spy, but we'll do it with long calls."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3212000","3213560"," You're going to do long calls on spy, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3214040","3220160"," You must have a plan when you're entering that trade in your brain."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3220440","3222320"," You need to have, this is my entry."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3222440","3223440"," This is my exit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3223960","3225360"," This, this is how this works."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3225360","3226560"," This is now this doesn't work."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3227640","3228880"," I'm flat and good."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3229240","3230000"," I'm flat right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3232600","3237240"," You need to have a plan for if it goes against you, you should not be saying to"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3237240","3241600"," yourself out there, well, I'm going to stay short because of my thesis, even though"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3241600","3242440"," it's going against me."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3242960","3243360"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3243720","3247400"," You exit your trade, you try to make up that trade that you're if you've lost"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3247400","3250760"," money in that trade, try to make that trade up somewhere else and then get back"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3250760","3251880"," into that thesis, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3251880","3254080"," If your thesis is ripped up, you switch to the bear side."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3254480","3256920"," The thesis goes bullish, you switch to that bull side."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3257400","3258000"," Makes sense."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3259200","3262400"," And if your plan is validated and it goes where you want it to go up or down,"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3263400","3268520"," but if it doesn't have a plan to exit to lick your wounds instead of just"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3268520","3274400"," getting fucking annihilated, it's it's brutal when you're like, if your whole"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3274400","3278880"," account is $10,000 and you fucking make a $10,000 bet and it starts to go against"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3278880","3283560"," you and you just and you just and you just like dig your heels in and say, I'm"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3283560","3284440"," staying in this trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3284480","3285120"," I've done that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3285720","3288160"," I've lost six figures doing that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3288200","3291520"," I've lost six figures and not one day."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3292520","3296120"," These are like two week out, one month trades for six figures."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3296560","3301240"," When I was younger in my trading career, I would dig my heels in and say, fuck"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3301240","3301440"," that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3301440","3302160"," It's going to come back."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3302400","3305920"," You ever start telling yourself that, like I was telling myself early, I"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3305920","3308680"," bought some puts to offset that trade that was getting beat up on."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3309280","3310600"," You have to have a plan."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3310760","3317400"," You have to, you have to, you have to, how to offset theses that are wrong."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3317440","3321240"," So I try to do that for you guys in this show, which is give you guys where"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3321240","3322040"," expected to go."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3322040","3324880"," If it starts to break below to go look lower, stuff like that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3324920","3326400"," So I guess I guess that's my point there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3326760","3329960"," That whole this whole conversation goes back to what did captain say?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3331200","3336320"," And I normally give you every, every idea or this is what could happen."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3336960","3338280"," This is way expectation."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3338480","3342280"," If we, if that thesis gets broken, this is your positioning to go lower."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3345240","3347480"," Is that you can, you made it, you set it perfectly."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3347480","3351640"," Dean W. S just said it heard a similar saying, you can either be right or you"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3351640","3352360"," can make money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3352520","3355800"," And that is a great way to state that you can be right or make money."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3355840","3360520"," I'm telling you what, dude, making money feels so much fucking better than any"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3360520","3364920"," street cred that you can have on Twitter or anywhere else."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3365000","3370920"," Wall Street, that's stock twits, uh, fucking investing.com forums for"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3370920","3375560"," futures at nighttime, the forums on thinkorswim forums on tasty."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3376000","3377160"," Doesn't fucking matter."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3377160","3382000"," Wherever you call home, uh, discord doesn't matter if you're right or wrong."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3382000","3383360"," It matters that you can shift."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3383800","3386640"," You have to be able to shift when needed."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3389680","3390440"," Yeah, I agree."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3390440","3398200"," Yeah, who said that stretching walls just said investing trading is the worst"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3398200","3399720"," place to seek validation."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3399760","3402440"," Abs of fucking the, and you know what the worst part of that is?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3403280","3404760"," You know what the worst part of that is?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3405880","3408000"," There are pariahs out there."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3408280","3409280"," I don't do this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3409760","3410600"," You, I can prove it to you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3410600","3411280"," I can tell you right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3411280","3411880"," I don't do this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3412240","3413600"," I don't sell you guys shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3413640","3414840"," I don't monetize shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3415400","3417120"," I don't do the clickbait shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3417200","3418440"," Sometimes I do as a joke."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3418440","3422440"," Matter of fact, ST short seller ST and I used to make fun of this shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3422440","3424960"," Like if you do doom and gloom, you'll get a hundred thousand followers."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3425080","3425520"," Easy."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3425600","3426480"," I get a hundred thousand followers."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3426480","3430120"," If I did doom and gloom posts every day and fin to it, I'd have a hundred thousand"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3430120","3430680"," followers."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3430760","3433920"," I know I would, but I don't partake in that shit."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3434760","3437560"," Um, and there are subsellers out there that do this."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3437560","3442680"," There are people that will entertain your emotions to get to your purse rings."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3443040","3446040"," Um, and I think that shit's grown."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3446040","3449280"," I, I, I shouldn't say I can understand some people not having a problem with it."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3449320","3450600"," I have a fucking problem with it, but."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3452280","3457560"," Uh, needless to say that internet cred shit, dude, it, dude, take that shit and just rip it up."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3457560","3460200"," You don't owe people shit on social media."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3460600","3462920"," When you're losing money, do those people come pay your bills for you?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3463320","3464000"," Let me ask you that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3465000","3467720"," When that guy that's out there telling you we're going to have a 1987 crash and he's"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3467720","3469360"," selling you so just selling a sub to you."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3470320","3472240"," Do you think that guy cares if we crash or not?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3472720","3476920"," Fuck no, you think that guy closes his shit and as we go up, fuck yes."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3477600","3482960"," Um, you know, just, just trade your trade, what you're trading and put the blinders on."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3492880","3493880"," Uh, we're bullish right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3493880","3498440"," So we are, we're, until we break through that fucking hourly trigger, we're bullish."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3498440","3499760"," We're buying dips in the hourly trigger."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3500240","3502640"," So your stance here should be bullish unless you break through."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3502680","3505920"," So, and if we do break through and start selling, let's say we start selling"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3505920","3507440"," Friday or some nonsense like that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3508320","3511440"," Um, you can just cut that, that bot call side of that trade."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3511720","3516040"," Now, other pieces here would be you dive in hand, that fucker right until"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3516040","3518360"," four, it's like 359 PM on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3518720","3524800"," Cause if we do trade sideways, they could sneak it up, um, into, uh, into Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3524800","3525760"," No, let me take up a quick peek here."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3525760","3525960"," Hold on."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3525960","3527520"," Let me look at the calls on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3527520","3527800"," Hold on."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3529760","3535720"," Yeah, you're ready for this?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3535720","3537440"," This is fucking a prime trade, dude."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3538960","3543920"," There's 196,456 for Fridays out there right now."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3543920","3548160"," So there's a high probability we're going to trade above that 456 into the bell on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3549480","3550720"," I'm going to post that on Twitter too."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3551720","3554840"," Uh, every day that you're alive is a good day in my book, you know?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3555040","3557720"," So try, try to, try to live that over this weekend, if you can."

"SDHKIv4C85Y","3576320","3576640"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3576640","3579840"," If there's anything like we need to know or anything scary over the weekend, anything"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3579840","3585480"," huge, if I can't stream on Friday, uh, where I'm at, I will still be live on Twitter."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3585560","3588200"," So let's say, let's say on Friday, I can't stream."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3588240","3594720"," I will be like actively giving exact like buy sell signals on Twitter, uh, on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3594720","3596120"," So, but I think I'll be able to stream on Friday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3596120","3596880"," So I don't think it'll be an issue."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3597680","3600760"," Uh, what else I'll say to you guys, and I'll be here on Monday as well."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3600760","3605480"," So there'll be no like, uh, breakup of, of, um, like cap disappears for weeks, something"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3605480","3607000"," like that, or I missed a flight or something like that."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3607000","3608240"," I will be back on Monday."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3608640","3611880"," Well, I guess I could get fucked if there's weather, but I'm saying that right now."

"SDHKIv4C85Y","3633960","3637200"," Um, the one thing I want to say to you though, is I saw a lot of negativity on"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3637200","3637800"," Reddit this week."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3637800","3640320"," And I was like, I got a, I'm an old man."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3640320","3641080"," I got to tell you something."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3641080","3641480"," Okay."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3642400","3643840"," Well, this is the same thing."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3644440","3646600"," This is the same thing with like bitching, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3646600","3649840"," About, I can't afford a house and I'm like, you got to go somewhere that you can't"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3649840","3651000"," find an affordable house."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3651520","3653560"," You might not be able to live in Beverly Hills, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3653840","3658480"," Uh, the warning that I gave once to oftentimes you heard old men, like old men"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3658480","3662840"," will bitch and be like, you know, uh, put down the avocado toast, stop ordering"

"SDHKIv4C85Y","3664560","3666680"," That's really not the way to do things, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3667120","3669840"," Uh, an old person should be telling you how to get a house, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3670160","3673280"," Like not just pull up your fucking bootstraps, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3673920","3676920"," Um, so I think that's really derogatory and negative."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3676960","3682120"," And what can happen is you can spend your, your best years whining and bitching"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3682120","3683640"," and not doing something about it, right?"
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3684320","3685600"," That's actually viable."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3686080","3688640"," And the same thing goes for these holidays is my point."
"SDHKIv4C85Y","3688640","3691720"," So if you're young and you're like, you're like edge Lord and you're like, fuck"
