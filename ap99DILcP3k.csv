"2250","7650"," This leader is provided to permit the projectionist to complete adjustment of focus and sound level"
"7650","9390"," before the film begins."
"166030","167150"," See we got going on here."
"167230","167950"," Good morning, everybody. "
"168650","170730"," One more day, countdown to the Fed Day."
"171410","175850"," If you chased that hole last night, let me know in the chat if you're going to take the money"
"175850","177730"," and run or hold the bell."
"179450","180750"," Let's see if we can switch this over. "
"184950","186370"," We know what you're going to do here."
"186850","188670"," I didn't chase the hole last night."
"188890","189470"," I wanted to. "
"189470","195850"," In the stream, I was like, man, under any normal circumstance, this is a beautiful hole right here"
"195850","196230"," to chase."
"198330","202770"," As a matter of fact, in the right and the after hours up here, there was a great opportunity."
"203390","210930"," We had talked about this crossover into the clothes that normally I would take that zero day puts"
"210930","211450"," into here. "
"212730","216450"," But recently when I've done this, it hasn't paid."
"218430","219910"," Now, this one looks like it's paying."
"220150","222410"," We've got five minutes left, so which is good. "
"222630","226630"," But last 10 times of the last 10 times, they haven't paid."
"226850","228310"," So it not being a short thing."
"229130","230170"," Coming into FMC. "
"231730","239650"," I didn't want to risk the cash market being bought before he opened this morning."
"240070","241510"," So I was like, oh, I'm going to go flat."
"241770","246050"," Now, with that said, yesterday I was a few, I have a few points for you this morning. "
"248130","252730"," Yesterday, one of the points that we reviewed today was yesterday, I was like, I think we're flat"
"252730","255110"," into these rate decisions."
"256110","258329"," But I didn't know the data."
"258510","259230"," That's just my recollection. "
"259610","260490"," So I went back and looked."
"261630","265990"," And we just trend into rate decision, FMC rate decisions."
"266550","269550"," You know, actually, it's not like a Fed meeting. "
"271430","272590"," Or it hasn't been."
"273710","277350"," If we're trending up, we continue to trend up into these rate decisions."
"278510","281610"," If we trend down, we trend down into these rate decisions. "
"282090","282670"," So I'm wrong."
"283590","290190"," And with that said, I do wonder if we can trade down into this rate decision."
"291050","292470"," I can't guarantee it, but. "
"294850","296170"," I'll now show you."
"297330","298550"," I'll show you here."
"299210","303750"," The reason why I'm saying this is because you got the nice cross here on the five minute yesterday,"
"303750","308110"," which is the key for us to continue, continue lower into today. "
"308650","311590"," The implied move in the market is not that low, though."
"311730","314910"," It's four, 13, 17, four, 16, 50 on the upside."
"316350","317990"," I always hate these days. "
"318590","319710"," These days before."
"320850","322890"," I feel like there's always a trap in here."
"323830","326710"," Normally as a bull, I feel like there's, I didn't see it. "
"327690","331430"," When I looked back, but I always feel like we go up and then you get trapped at like one"
"331430","332570"," 33 30 in the afternoon."
"333050","334130"," They lock your ass in."
"334430","337190"," And then there's this like promise of going down into FMC. "
"338790","341290"," And then they trap your ass in there too, as a bear."
"343050","344450"," So you kind of like locked in."
"344850","346710"," Maybe it's the reverse today if you're a bear. "
"347690","350470"," That we sell down and then you get locked into."
"352290","354190"," The opposite side of that trade here."
"354370","357670"," Anyways, I looked back on the data. "
"357670","359810"," It didn't seem to say that it seemed like it didn't care."
"360790","362310"," Rate decision specifically."
"363670","367230"," We have some rate decision stuff to go over today as well. "
"367690","369110"," Nine twenty eight two minutes left."
"369130","373070"," If I want to know if you're going to hold if you're in puts here or not."
"374330","376390"," Personally, I'd probably take the money, but. "
"377330","379970"," You know, you guys have to make your own decisions on what you're going to do."
"380710","382350"," I'm going to let this open up and breathe."
"382730","384970"," I would like to take some puts here though. "
"387130","392050"," Personally, if that if that's how we're going to be with this rate decision where the market's just"
"392050","393890"," going to trade where it's supposed to be going."
"394570","397610"," Maybe I'll maybe I'll just get some puts if there's a chance here in the bell."
"398770","402090"," Otherwise, though, flat on least on zero dates, one day, it's that kind of stuff. "
"407080","409260"," The second thing that we have to go over today would be."
"411140","414720"," This like selling may go away yesterday."
"415000","416320"," We talked about price targets. "
"417960","419460"," On selling may go away."
"419800","421880"," We've got forty three seconds until the bell, the opening bell."
"421880","424740"," I was talking yesterday about it. "
"425700","427560"," And I we looked at the algorithm."
"429760","433300"," I wanted to just say like temper."
"433600","435020"," I said this yesterday, but. "
"435740","439900"," Temper your expectations on what that salad may entails to."
"440280","441920"," We still have Apple reporting."
"443140","444940"," And even so. "
"445920","448880"," Yesterday when we were looking at that algorithm, it showed."
"448880","452640"," It showed 440 zigzags are showing 440."
"453500","455660"," As long as we hold the channel. "
"456380","457780"," Trend should continue."
"458300","460780"," So I think it was 443 or something like that."
"461320","462000"," We're looking at yesterday. "
"462680","464920"," So just just be patient."
"466200","467580"," We'll look at it today."
"468820","472320"," And we're going to go over what Timaro said in his article yesterday. "
"473220","474500"," And find out."
"476040","477520"," There was some concerning."
"479700","484600"," I reread that article yesterday after the close and there was some. "
"484700","486600"," I had some concern with what some of what was said."
"487140","488720"," There was some talk about."
"489940","493140"," Not just a pause or the 25 BPS and pause. "
"493580","495960"," There was something whispers of rate cut in that article."
"496440","498300"," So I want to get your take on that this morning."
"499120","501440"," I don't like what fucking yelling is doing. "
"502280","504060"," She was working me yesterday."
"506080","508360"," And John Hagerty was commenting on it."
"509200","512039"," And I was like, I'm just not going to say anything right now because I was so angry. "
"513320","516900"," And then I read an article or that I read a piece."
"517700","518960"," On Reddit yesterday."
"519440","520440"," Nice sell on the bell here. "
"521320","521799"," 41444."
"522220","523520"," And just the note here."
"524340","527280"," We are in a three one, two, three trigger. "
"528200","530800"," The bearish cross on."
"531040","534040"," We are on a three trigger bearish cross on."
"535560","536240"," The. "
"536920","539040"," The T three indicator right now."
"541520","542900"," So with that said."
"544340","545020"," The. "
"546600","551100"," Yellen yesterday was driving me insane and then I read an article about the debt."
"551440","552640"," The debt ceiling."
"553640","557560"," Yesterday and my mind was I couldn't wrap my head. "
"559180","560340"," Around the Reddit."
"561840","563480"," Conversation that was taking place."
"564420","565060"," Yesterday. "
"565800","568820"," I couldn't wrap my head around the."
"570180","574620"," You know, like just like I was complaining about the Tesla, the bots and space X now."
"575580","576680"," I'm reading this. "
"576960","580740"," I'm reading the comments in this article that was posted."
"580740","582860"," I did my mind."
"583040","584440"," I couldn't wrap my head around. "
"585560","589940"," The idea that there was an actual serious discussion."
"592200","596060"," On whether this would be passed or not."
"596360","599960"," It's like, I was like, it shouldn't even be a discussion. "
"603920","605760"," So, but of course it was a discussion."
"606540","608200"," I thought these people were insane."
"609200","610920"," To think that it could be a discussion. "
"611480","613760"," And of course, Yellen is the chair leader."
"615020","618360"," Of this heading into FMC rate decision."
"619400","622440"," Which kind of kind of weird to be hearing from her. "
"623200","625220"," It's almost as if she's being sent out there."
"625760","629060"," To be like, yeah, they're going to blast this market higher."
"629400","633540"," So instead of me threatening, maybe it's your turn to threaten. "
"635520","636720"," When in reality."
"637820","639860"," It would be the debasing of the dollar."
"640220","641620"," It would be the world currency. "
"642000","645380"," You're talking about the economic collapse of the United States of America."
"645920","646520"," This is insane."
"646880","647640"," I can't even believe. "
"648320","650740"," That it's that it's even a discussion."
"652420","654180"," It's like when crazy people talk."
"654480","655900"," You don't you don't listen to them. "
"656100","657160"," They can go sit in a corner."
"657740","659600"," At a public park in talk."
"660340","662000"," No, it's supposedly they're being given. "
"663120","665220"," They're being given quarter to talk."
"665780","667720"," Nice weakness off the bell right now."
"671900","673600"," Four fourteen sixty. "
"675660","679120"," Cell side is at four fourteen sixty up here."
"682880","683900"," Right there."
"686680","688620"," We'll see if Southside can hold on right now. "
"695440","697140"," But I was I was a little shocked."
"697340","700200"," Don't forget this implied move down below four thirteen seventeen."
"703840","705480"," I'm a little I'm a little shocked. "
"705740","706580"," I just."
"707560","709560"," Maybe I'm just getting old or something."
"709760","712800"," Maybe I'm too old to remember or to know some of this stuff. "
"713760","716380"," So it's it's like it's like Kabuki theater."
"718180","719460"," Intentional Kabuki theater."
"720780","722420"," But it really means nothing. "
"723100","724640"," So how do you trade it?"
"726440","729540"," How do you trade it into now they're saying June first."
"730640","733860"," Not like mid June third week of June."
"734020","737680"," So there's like all this doom and gloom over this debt sailing stuff. "
"738980","744440"," You're talking about like you'd be considered treasonous to the United States of America if this"
"744440","744980"," wasn't passed."
"747500","752600"," I'm not talking about putting it off or a temporary agreement or something like that."
"752720","754320"," Just the idea of the discussion. "
"760360","761540"," Man, I wish I took those."
"761720","762420"," It's like the sworn."
"762420","766020"," I'm like I wish I took those puts and then my mother's side of it brain is like. "
"767840","769260"," My other side brain is like."
"770680","774800"," You have to stay with your rules like stay with your rules."
"775760","779860"," Because you can always your twenty twenty hindsight is always like oh I would have totally been"
"779860","780360"," right there. "
"781120","784760"," But I already know that statistically I wouldn't have been right the other nine times I'd be"
"784760","786020"," fucking upside down and burning."
"792600","793460"," So there you go."
"793920","796240"," So so that's what we're going to talk about today. "
"796340","799420"," We're going to talk about what Nick Tamarose was saying."
"799680","800980"," We're going to talk about."
"802340","806800"," Four dollars and eight cents would be the lowest closing price since March twenty nine. "
"808800","811220"," I'll read some headlines off to you right now."
"811820","812720"," Then we're going to discuss."
"814180","816840"," We're going to discuss what Nick Tamarose said yesterday. "
"816840","825460"," We're going to talk about twenty five VPS surprise fifty VPS pause in any discussion about."
"827880","828880"," Rate cuts."
"829620","831360"," That's going to be our thing for tomorrow. "
"832140","833960"," And then we'll look for some targets down below."
"834600","836180"," We've got S1 down below here."
"836520","840400"," You to actually hear water flame futures, forex and stock instruments. "
"841120","843660"," We've got this previous low from two sessions before."
"843880","845940"," I'm going to do a little tag for that one right here."
"847000","848260"," Right where you are right now. "
"848300","852160"," This is a previous low from two sessions ago from the twenty eighth of April."
"852800","854500"," The next the next one."
"854520","855240"," So this one right here. "
"856300","857400"," This is your first one."
"859300","864000"," Your next one down below here is the previous low from the twenty eighth in the morning in the am"
"864000","864680"," part of the session."
"865400","866600"," You got S2 here. "
"867140","871120"," You get the implied move over here of four thirteen seventeen for the downside."
"872540","877340"," We do have a three trigger cluster above negative bearish free trigger cluster above."
"877820","880600"," And we also have an hourly bearish divergence. "
"881140","882080"," I'll show you that real quick."
"882280","883840"," So you guys are trading this right now."
"887990","889410"," Just so you can see it here. "
"890790","896930"," You've got one two and three the hourly the five minute and the one minute."
"897830","900230"," Bearish cluster and then right here in the downside."
"900270","902410"," This is the hourly show you this here. "
"904930","906690"," You can see here we've got."
"907110","908530"," Let me meet this for a minute here."
"910750","911930"," Take tight here for a second. "
"918130","919330"," So just down here."
"919890","924950"," We're kind of peeking out on Max bullishness here in the market and you're seeing the hourly roll"
"924950","926490"," over into bearish."
"927130","931510"," So you might be able to have some continuation here on the downside. "
"933670","935930"," First bit of downside that we've had in some time."
"936570","940450"," So just on the early here I'll show you the last time we did break below."
"940990","942670"," It did begin a trend lower. "
"943610","949610"," We've had weakness on the early but if we can get a confirmation that we're going lower you can see"
"949610","949850"," here."
"951650","956130"," Broke below and then continuation down lower so you do want to see that confirmation."
"958030","959450"," That could take some time. "
"959590","964270"," This is the 25th at five a.m. And this is nine thirties over a three hour period."
"964910","967730"," If we are going to continue lower over time."
"968410","969550"," You do want to see. "
"971430","978810"," You do want to see some sort of check higher and then the reversal down lower again for"
"978810","979930"," continuation for the bears."
"980990","982950"," I can take anywhere from one to three hours."
"988940","989660"," Bear share. "
"989920","990380"," So this is good."
"993420","998700"," And that question is how deep do we go as three down below four twelve thirty three."
"999340","1000000"," It's a little bit lower. "
"1000240","1004380"," Just above right there."
"1005580","1008600"," We're racing the entire move to pre market."
"1008600","1009960"," Actually I'll tag another one here. "
"1011300","1015380"," Racing the entire move to the open I think is right about there."
"1015840","1017060"," This is the pre market low."
"1017740","1019320"," So if you're able to break S3. "
"1025829","1027290"," And show that better there."
"1036359","1037140"," We'll come here."
"1039800","1043140"," So we can show some lower so we can get anything lower there. "
"1047410","1049330"," It looks like a tight range doesn't it."
"1051210","1052490"," Tight that looks right there."
"1070830","1073830"," Okay, so I'm going to read off to you. "
"1074130","1074730"," By the way, good morning."
"1074850","1075770"," Everybody hope you're all doing well."
"1084940","1087540"," Yeah, check shares dropped more than four. "
"1087660","1091020"," I think it says 40% here, but I think it was 50% at one point."
"1091820","1093760"," And I was pissed off at that this morning."
"1094040","1097440"," I woke up this morning and we get up here more like four a.m. And I'm like. "
"1097440","1102900"," I was I looked through a list of what's that like a list of."
"1104720","1110360"," Sector rotation and we're actually rotating into educational software."
"1110360","1114680"," Yesterday we rotated into educational software sector. "
"1116540","1121160"," And check is on that list and I was going through the tickers."
"1121440","1125760"," See what was going up and check was down 50% I believe at that time."
"1125760","1128680"," And I was kind of pissed at myself again. "
"1128820","1129020"," I'm like."
"1129740","1134740"," Like we all know that chat GPT is going to replace services like."
"1135520","1136180"," Check. "
"1136680","1141100"," I'm like how the fuck didn't I how the fuck didn't I just start shorting."
"1141380","1144680"," Any of these companies that do online."
"1146820","1148080"," Online tutoring. "
"1148560","1152760"," Like chat GPT any of these any of these any of these ais."
"1155200","1158980"," I'm you get you got to think that there's definitely some startups out there."
"1159720","1161760"," That are like we're going to we're going to reinvent. "
"1162760","1165960"," The online tutoring space."
"1167000","1169640"," I'm sure check is panicking right now trying to get."
"1170500","1173500"," Their hands on some kind of AI tutoring as well. "
"1173800","1178100"," You like anyone they out there that can say we're using AI now."
"1179660","1183900"," It's like oh it's like oh yeah I'm jerking off AI over here and I'm jerking off AI over there."
"1184040","1185100"," Even if it's not true. "
"1185620","1189860"," I was surprised they didn't say that and they're in their in their ER."
"1190280","1191160"," All they had to say was."
"1193220","1195080"," We're searching for AI right now. "
"1196320","1198880"," We have a finger on AI right now something like that."
"1199440","1201160"," And the stock probably would have fucking mooned."
"1201960","1205520"," But they didn't say that they're quite honest and I got to give them respect for that that they"
"1205520","1205660"," were. "
"1206620","1211080"," Honest and saying hey look we didn't see anything they should have seen it coming."
"1212460","1213440"," They should have actually."
"1217060","1220540"," Said something before the ER but at least they said it in their ER I guess. "
"1222980","1226860"," The moment that shit broke they should have been they should have been in full panic mode."
"1229500","1232380"," Touching S2 right now tagging S2 on the downside."
"1234520","1236300"," Look at the one minute chart real quick here. "
"1241170","1242850"," Almost the perfect tag down here."
"1257980","1262060"," I'll keep you updated on where these where the sell side is here."
"1263620","1269920"," I'm down right here now. "
"1282010","1282570"," 1488."
"1284030","1288850"," They're actually up here."
"1288850","1290890"," These are the swellers up here. "
"1293370","1294630"," Change that to red."
"1295970","1297490"," We'll write the swellers in."
"1297990","1299410"," And I wanted to say something else too. "
"1299890","1301510"," I was going to make a post about this yesterday."
"1303030","1305710"," And on Twitter and I didn't I should have."
"1305890","1307010"," I might make post today. "
"1308210","1309250"," Yesterday in chat."
"1310410","1311210"," It's a bit of vacation."
"1311970","1313070"," And yesterday in chat. "
"1313810","1320550"," I was impressed with the number of people."
"1321750","1325790"," That on their owner watching these bare planes and bull planes."
"1326310","1327770"," They're watching them on the VIX. "
"1327970","1330170"," They're watching them on SPX on spy."
"1331290","1333690"," And very I have to say I'm very impressed."
"1334350","1338770"," Especially after being on vacation and coming back and people posting that information. "
"1339970","1341250"," Inside of the chat."
"1341470","1342570"," Two or three times yesterday."
"1343570","1345530"," That means that a lot of you. "
"1345930","1348410"," Are paying attention in stream."
"1348870","1350210"," That's all it's one of my."
"1350550","1353090"," I have two or three concerns in stream. "
"1354250","1356890"," One of my main concerns in stream, of course, is."
"1357210","1358810"," Hey, are people going to be here every day, right?"
"1360130","1362750"," Are people going to be inside of."
"1362910","1363630"," Over there. "
"1366710","1367970"," What are we concerned is him?"
"1368110","1370250"," I'm going to be talking to myself in the middle of nowhere."
"1371070","1371810"," They know it'll be here."
"1372510","1374630"," So meaning people aren't getting anything from this. "
"1375730","1377170"," Another concern, of course, is."
"1377350","1379110"," Hey, do they appreciate content that I make."
"1379850","1383330"," And then another part of that conversation is. "
"1383710","1385050"," A big part of that conversation is."
"1385450","1387650"," And I have this conversation with other people."
"1387970","1389050"," There are people in the stream. "
"1389870","1391550"," I talked to about this frequently."
"1391550","1392430"," Where I say."
"1392730","1393590"," And they say to me. "
"1394010","1397990"," Are they actually learning something or are they just looking for signals."
"1398990","1400330"," Because the intent of the stream."
"1401130","1402210"," As not to give you signals. "
"1402210","1405470"," The intent of this stream is for you to be here every day."
"1405670","1407850"," And over time."
"1410010","1412990"," Get from like get familiar with signals. "
"1414370","1415550"," On your own."
"1416490","1420690"," And that was a big part of my own."
"1422150","1422990"," Trading journey. "
"1423970","1428090"," I forget to talk about this frequently, but I don't talk."
"1428170","1430190"," I don't think a year or two."
"1430810","1431270"," But. "
"1432330","1435330"," The intent of even starting the stream was."
"1436350","1436910"," Because."
"1437930","1440410"," The missing piece for me, at least as a trader. "
"1441310","1443070"," Was not having anyone."
"1443850","1444630"," Beside me."
"1445410","1447670"," And then an end paid for services. "
"1448010","1449970"," I paid for every fucking service out there."
"1449970","1450930"," You name it."
"1451170","1451990"," You know, I bought this one. "
"1452090","1453310"," I rented that one."
"1453430","1454490"," I leased this one."
"1454630","1455530"," I bought this one. "
"1456770","1459010"," And then I joined expensive discords."
"1460030","1463050"," Like, you know, like four, five, six hundred thousand dollars a month."
"1463750","1464110"," Discords. "
"1464590","1466090"," And then I paid alphas."
"1467250","1468190"," For their live streams."
"1468510","1469410"," Like private live streams. "
"1470370","1471930"," That I could join in meetings."
"1473430","1473790"," Zoom calls."
"1473910","1474450"," You name it. "
"1476370","1478050"," And that was the kind of the way."
"1478970","1483370"," That I was able to piece things together and say, say, all right, I feel confident now."
"1483410","1485750"," Like, where I went, I would trade alone. "
"1487150","1489150"," I didn't have confidence in my trading."
"1491190","1494530"," And of course, on social media, on Wall Street bats."
"1494810","1497810"," And then fint to it, I was like, I was like, these people. "
"1498430","1500730"," I was like, these people are losing their fucking shirts in the market."
"1500990","1502010"," I think they have to be."
"1502370","1504310"," I was like, some of the insane shit that I read. "
"1507580","1508940"," I'm like, these people are fucking crazy."
"1508940","1511660"," I'm like, I was pausing to myself."
"1511920","1514140"," I'm like, these people are either not trading. "
"1516300","1517180"," I don't know."
"1517260","1521000"," Maybe they're just hanging out at home or something or they've blown up their accounts at this"
"1521000","1521940"," point or this."
"1523140","1524120"," Maybe they're collecting fees. "
"1524460","1529540"," I mean, different people, different things, but I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I"
"1529540","1530220"," struggled with this."
"1532960","1535120"," For a long time, but I'm here to make money, right?"
"1536160","1539780"," If I'm here to make money, I would never be posting or saying this stuff."
"1540860","1544380"," This isn't just bears, like bulls too, like bulls saying shit. "
"1545300","1550820"," And then, of course, I found out that over time I found out that people actually are trading like"
"1550820","1551000"," that."
"1551540","1553960"," Like people send me like DMs and shit."
"1554240","1555820"," Not as much as they used to. "
"1556800","1560000"," But the easiest semi DMs would be like, fuck you asshole."
"1564260","1565980"," I just bought Tesla at 1500."
"1567540","1569820"," Here's the proof and I'm like, oh shit. "
"1573160","1574420"," You're not, man."
"1575100","1579400"," Not just Tesla, so I'm like, okay, so I'm like, we're probably fucking losing their shirts."
"1579580","1584640"," My point here though is going back to yesterday in the chat. "
"1586100","1588800"," I got a really, I felt so good."
"1590100","1595640"," Seeing that a lot of you are like seeing this stuff on your own without me."
"1596120","1599160"," And that makes me proud. "
"1599880","1604680"," So if you're one of those people that are posting that information as the day goes forward, I want"
"1604680","1608520"," to tell you specifically that you make me proud."
"1609140","1615560"," I'm very proud of you seeing those signals and that you can see it before it happens."
"1615560","1622700"," So as you're seeing those things develop, that's kind of the point of what we're doing here. "
"1624200","1627620"," So you can run away at some point and start making tons of money."
"1628040","1630600"," And not that some of you don't already, but some of you guys don't."
"1631540","1637500"," And if you are, if you're gaining, gaining, gaining those signals, so you can see the direction of"
"1637500","1643940"," the market on higher and mid-term and lower timeframes, daily, weekly, monthly, free month,"
"1644060","1650800"," quarterly timeframes, hourly, four hour, and then of course 15-5 in one minute. "
"1653240","1659300"," So I wanted to say that I should have posted it on Twitter last night, but I was extremely busy"
"1659300","1659900"," last night."
"1660540","1670520"," My daughter is going to some kind of K-pop concert in Chicago, and it's just like dead"
"1670520","1671440"," things they've got to do."
"1672240","1676360"," I'm proud of being a Germanese child parent that's present. "
"1676880","1679900"," I'm just doing restrictive monetary policy as best as I can be."
"1680120","1684640"," I went out to the U.S. factory orders month over month, forecast one spot three percent on a prior"
"1684640","1689460"," of minus zero spot seven percent, with a range of two percent to minus zero spot four percent."
"1689940","1694940"," The U.S. jolt's job openings forecast nine spot seven, three, six million on a prior of nine spot"
"1694940","1699180"," nine three one million, with a range of ten spot three million to nine spot four million. "
"1699560","1704720"," U.S. court durable goods revised forecast zero spot three percent, on a prior of zero spot three"
"1704720","1709420"," percent, and the U.S. durable goods revised forecast three spot two percent, on a prior of three"
"1709420","1710160"," spot two percent."
"1711340","1715020"," So you have jobs coming out here at ten a.m. and ten minutes."
"1716380","1721220"," We've got the previous jobs reported of nine point nine million jobs. "
"1721220","1725400"," The expected today is nine point six million."
"1725920","1726500"," That's job openings."
"1727320","1733160"," And then at ten a.m. we also have factory orders previously minus point seven percent. "
"1734100","1738560"," And the expectation this time for factory orders one point two percent."
"1738780","1746220"," And we've seen major flows into industrials and not a lot of returns on"
"1746220","1750640"," industrials."
"1750640","1754060"," So that's a pretty big expectation there for factory orders. "
"1754280","1758520"," As we must fight inflation and we must also reduce energy costs."
"1762920","1766400"," I was looking through again the sector stuff."
"1767700","1772800"," We're rolling into industrial season. "
"1773460","1778460"," Keep harping on that past week or two and harping on industrials industrials."
"1778460","1780060"," And they're not looking good right now."
"1780280","1783240"," I think if we look back in a month or two or three, they look great. "
"1784380","1786180"," But of course right now they got wet feet."
"1786300","1787660"," I'm like I don't want to go in there yet."
"1790060","1793940"," But there's billions rolling into industrials right now. "
"1794140","1795900"," And it's not printing like not heavy."
"1797900","1800800"," So but I haven't harping on them those recently here."
"1808410","1809850"," Always before never after. "
"1812050","1826840"," Okay, so"
"1826840","1827200"," I'm going to read."
"1828000","1831900"," We got eight minutes left until those numbers come in."
"1833060","1836740"," And we're going to I'm going to read to you. "
"1836880","1837300"," Where is that?"
"1837920","1838400"," Okay."
"1839800","1841860"," Nick Tamarose, our man Nick."
"1842000","1843700"," I meant to read this yesterday didn't have the time to. "
"1844220","1846020"," He did post a tweet yesterday."
"1846900","1848660"," But yesterday's article is important to read."
"1849420","1854220"," Fed set to raise interest rates to 16 year high and debate a pause. "
"1855040","1859080"," Kind of key right there's set to raise rates to a 16 year high."
"1859260","1866800"," We know that the rate of rate increases has been the steepest and fastest in history."
"1867740","1874820"," We know though that we could go to 10 or 20 points to believe it or not. "
"1874820","1881240"," Or not points, but yeah, 10 to 20 points."
"1883260","1885900"," We need to get above like seven and a half minimum."
"1887680","1894120"," We know that as we raise rates, we're going to continue to break things. "
"1895120","1899420"," We know that commercial real estate is in a panic."
"1900740","1904060"," We know the Fed will not the more warn you of this."
"1905140","1906020"," They will not. "
"1906980","1910680"," Allow commercial backed securities to fail."
"1911140","1911920"," Warn you of this."
"1912100","1912720"," They will not. "
"1913940","1915420"," That's your collapse scenario."
"1916260","1916780"," Right there."
"1917760","1918500"," Now they will turn. "
"1918800","1920520"," Matter of fact, the printer hasn't been turned off."
"1921220","1929400"," Commercial backed securities, believe it or not."
"1929400","1929640"," I see that. "
"1929960","1931640"," Not IE, but asterisk."
"1932460","1933940"," Commercial backed real estate."
"1936040","1941600"," But if this is important, Fed set to raise interest rates to 16 year high and debate a pause. "
"1942240","1943720"," We know it's not high enough."
"1946420","1954000"," My expectation here is 25 basis points in a discussion for a pause."
"1956120","1958820"," I think that discussion for a pause is bullshit. "
"1959340","1961780"," I think it's meant to, well, a couple of things."
"1962520","1964660"," I think you're going to hear discussion of a pause."
"1965860","1969960"," Although Nick Temeros says something kind of scary in this, in this. "
"1971120","1971560"," Particle."
"1972400","1975180"," But I want to warn bulls of something."
"1975340","1976260"," So five minutes away now. "
"1976400","1981140"," So we get the US five three orders month over month forecast one spot three percent on a prior of"
"1981140","1983860"," minus zero spot seven percent with a range of two percent."
"1983860","1990500"," Two minus zero spot four percent US jobs job openings forecast minus apologies forecast nine spot"
"1990500","1995920"," seven three six million on a prior of nine spot nine three one million with a range of 10 spot"
"1995920","1998820"," three million to nine spot four million US code."
"1998980","2004320"," Jubable goods revised forecast zero spot three percent on a prior of zero spot three percent in the"
"2004320","2008800"," US Jubable goods revised forecast three spot two percent on a prior three spot two percent. "
"2010480","2013860"," Don't forget this H line down below four twelve thirty one."
"2015680","2020020"," This implied move here for thirteen seventeen right there."
"2025120","2028200"," This was before the open by the way, so this does change. "
"2032340","2036660"," Now key point here is let's say they do the twenty five BPS."
"2036660","2040680"," And they start to discuss the pause."
"2042480","2043660"," I'll be honest with you. "
"2043940","2044940"," I don't like that."
"2047500","2052940"," Because I don't think they're done raising rates and any rate increase in the future will be a"
"2052940","2053280"," surprise."
"2055460","2061020"," So that'll be a fascinating interplay inside of. "
"2062780","2065460"," They'll be a fascinating interplay inside of."
"2068360","2072840"," Rate future rate decisions future fed meetings."
"2072840","2075420"," Does that open up the door to questions of. "
"2076080","2079679"," Not being telegraphed any longer for getting any more rate increases."
"2079960","2080880"," So that'll be it."
"2081020","2083560"," Just just keep that in your mind that if they do pause. "
"2085860","2091719"," Or if there's a discussion of a pause what impact does that have that introduce more new volatility"
"2091719","2092520"," into the market."
"2093179","2095100"," Because I don't think they've done raising rates."
"2095340","2095820"," I don't think you should. "
"2096360","2097160"," I don't think that you're."
"2097420","2101540"," I don't think in your mind unless they start saying rate cuts."
"2102160","2106780"," I don't think that you should logically think that they're done raising rates. "
"2108900","2109660"," Three minutes."
"2114170","2115750"," If they are done raising rates."
"2116070","2118190"," I'm going to read the rest of Timrose to you. "
"2120430","2127090"," This key here fed sets rate set to raise interest rates to six in your high and debate a pause."
"2128790","2131410"," And this is the key here is yelling."
"2134490","2134850"," I mean. "
"2137350","2140710"," I can't even just I can't even think about."
"2141460","2144530"," Whatever dog shits is going to spew tomorrow."
"2146710","2149910"," She's going to be interviewed while Jay Pao is giving his presser. "
"2151270","2152750"," And just the diarrhea."
"2154010","2158670"," That's coming out of her mouth about something that's not going to happen."
"2160610","2166770"," Anyways officials could keep their options open and crafting signals around the end game for"
"2166770","2167550"," increases. "
"2169330","2172550"," End game IE rate cuts."
"2173650","2175010"," Now that's a shock or two."
"2175930","2183590"," You're talking about fighting inflation and Timrose right in his headline is saying end game for"
"2183590","2184630"," increasing rates. "
"2184950","2187650"," Four thirteen sixty eight right now."
"2189070","2194770"," Nine fifty eight two minutes left full hedge on the market waiting for these numbers to come in."
"2197360","2202940"," So there's already discussion in just the title of this article about an end game for rate"
"2202940","2203800"," increases. "
"2204780","2210300"," So that the assumption here from that article is saying fuck inflation we're just going to let a"
"2210300","2210580"," rage."
"2211500","2213940"," That's kind of a shock out of here in that article."
"2214840","2215860"," Especially from Nick. "
"2224170","2228370"," Let me know if your still long puts as this information comes out as this news drops."
"2230430","2231270"," Let me know in the chat."

"4823290","4826850"," I want you to see this move back here on the 26th of April. "
"4827710","4839400"," So somewhere down in here, you're going to see either a bloodbath down"
"4839400","4839640"," here."
"4839640","4840980"," And then a rejection to come higher."
"4842300","4843280"," Right, you'll see the end of it. "
"4844020","4848220"," Or you'll see the squeeze higher and hopefully the tag below and higher."
"4848820","4849820"," Or this could be it."
"4850100","4853700"," Sometimes you don't actually get down and tag this yellow line. "
"4854300","4856700"," Just be careful that right where we are."
"4857840","4863160"," You'll start to want to take the money and run down here for a reversal higher."
"4865920","4868240"," I've got a sell order and some puts down here. "
"4868360","4869160"," They haven't filled yet."

"4873580","4875460"," Just as a companion piece to this. "
"4877560","4881060"," And what you're looking for here for that last move down."
"4881380","4882460"," This is the VIX here, right?"
"4883360","4890370"," What you're looking for here is for that last little peg."
"4891190","4893570"," For the consolidation on the hourly. "
"4894350","4897450"," And then one more push higher on the VIX."
"4897730","4901030"," You get the one minute, the five minute onto this hourly trigger."
"4901570","4904370"," And get one more cluster for one more blast lower. "
"4905630","4916020"," That expectation would be that we trade on the VIX to 20.59. If"
"4916020","4919940"," we can get to that 20.59, that would be a nice blast right through this."
"4920400","4923300"," And then a rejection and come back higher again somewhere in here."
"4931320","4932860"," We'll keep an eye on the VIX right now. "
"4948540","4951140"," The SPX is getting down to its daily as well."
"4951680","4959760"," The SPX, if you want to know where the daily is on that, it's 4098.65. And then on ES."
"4962740","4965400"," ES is below both its daily. "
"4966260","4970660"," It's below its hourly and it's below its five minutes and one minute."
"4974340","4991420"," So we can get down here and tag this 408.71. You"
"4991420","4993200"," see what you guys are saying inside the chat."
"5004520","5005480"," Yeah, I'm looking. "
"5006040","5007020"," I'm looking to buy."
"5007320","5010000"," I want to buy some like some oil or some UNG down here."

"5067840","5075100"," I'm going to be looking to buy some calls here in just a moment."
"5109500","5110660"," Come on, 410."
"5112100","5116920"," Well, I don't know if I should get the other doing right now is they're not bringing down 408s and"
"5116920","5117780"," 409s. "
"5118340","5125520"," So like we're trading 409.56. And they're asking me to pay like two bucks or $1.50 for 409s."
"5125560","5126260"," I don't want to pay that."
"5127540","5128920"," And they're not going to print 410. "
"5129300","5129620"," I don't think."
"5131320","5132920"," So I'm kind of in a pickle right now."
"5132920","5135740"," I want to see us get down here. "
"5136020","5141660"," We can get down here and then grab the 408s or 409s on zero dates."
"5173150","5185260"," Come on down, baby, 409.43. Yeah,"
"5185360","5186860"," I closed my puts to really two chase."
"5187760","5191560"," I closed right in here, but I got like $1.36 or something for him in here. "
"5191560","5202700"," So on a"
"5202700","5203920"," higher time frame here."
"5205080","5207000"," Took at a higher time frame here."
"5209260","5211120"," So right here in a five minute chart. "
"5212540","5214520"," There's a giant gap right here."
"5220950","5222230"," Right back here."
"5222410","5225510"," There's a giant gap 4054840601. "
"5228630","5231190"," I'm looking to get some calls though in here in this trigger."
"5233510","5234410"," I don't know."
"5234590","5236370"," I think we can get down there. "
"5237910","5242650"," Like that possibly, but I don't think we just blast down there right now."
"5242710","5243450"," I don't think that we do."
"5257190","5261130"," I've got a 410 C's for 94 cents. "
"5264130","5267370"," Even if we blast down into here, I want to be on that trade."
"5267730","5270750"," So if we can get down through here, I might have to add to the position."
"5271910","5275270"," But I got some I got some 410 C's. "
"5289320","5291300"," Most of the call side has been burned."

"5328160","5329640"," Long of a tooth here. "
"5330280","5331080"," It's getting close."
"5332700","5338200"," I'm not anti going down or like I'm not anti doing like a slam it through really quick."
"5338740","5341820"," Pipulation move, but then a roll later on down here. "
"5342880","5346600"," Some kind of a role, but I think it's going to take time to get down there."

"5595760","5597560"," So I got some going on the background doing. "
"5600100","5602360"," 408 98 was the low right now."
"5685430","5686730"," Sorry, I was reading your comments."

"5703920","5705440"," All this rotation right now."
"5708760","5711060"," Could get more role to the downside."
"5711780","5715780"," There's some other targets that I have down below here. "
"5716620","5719880"," This is where that gap is not showing up on the one minute chart."
"5720940","5725220"," There's this little gap down here between 405 48 and 40 601."

"5731640","5731900"," here. "
"5733080","5734700"," I'll just enter again."
"5735060","5741900"," Now, with that said, even if we do get the trade higher, I'm going to look to see if it"
"5741900","5744380"," does roll back down here into the close today."
"5745060","5749300"," If we can actually get down to that 406 405 48 4601. "
"5750060","5753480"," Right now I'm in 410 C's zero dates."
"5757990","5764210"," Yeah, that's a pretty good sell off right there."
"5764210","5766390"," This shows it better on the chart here. "
"5771930","5776630"," Down 1.51%. It's pretty big."
"5776630","5778210"," It's pretty big sell off."

"5791570","5793210"," Let me look at it on a 30 minute chart. "
"5795930","5797490"," Percentage wise in a day."
"5800490","5801610"," After hours."
"5802410","5808550"," Now we sold saw some relentless selling down here on the ninth on March 9th. "
"5808930","5811430"," That's pretty significant though and that shit didn't end."
"5812210","5814670"," It was all the way into the close down here."
"5818500","5820560"," Like that kind of major selling. "
"5820560","5823480"," We had some back here on OPEC's."
"5828680","5830520"," It's pretty big move right here."
"5842650","5844830"," Coming down into the daily trigger right now. "
"5849140","5853000"," There's that gap down below at 405 and 40601."
"5860470","5863030"," I'm going to try to grab another 10 pack here in just a minute."
"5874260","5878900"," And Vix has more room to run up to so we could might not be done here. "
"5878900","5880760"," I mean, Vix can run from here."
"5880840","5883740"," Vix can run all at the $20 and 62 cents."
"5884400","5886300"," So we might not be done going down here. "
"5886840","5888920"," We might get a nice blast lower here."
"5889420","5890500"," I was going to add another."
"5891660","5893920"," I've got 24 10 C's. "

"5903160","5904460"," To add to the position. "
"5904880","5906060"," If that doesn't happen."
"5907000","5908480"," This is on the."
"5908600","5911840"," Well, Vix is saying this is on the table right now. "
"5912180","5914220"," This stream is sponsored by Tickshrike."
"5914760","5919640"," Tickshrike allows you to only get torched here and I'd rather buy this with another."
"5919820","5924520"," I'd rather buy 10 pack down here and not have 30 contracts up here. "
"5934020","5935880"," Although I do want to buy some right now."
"5938580","5951880"," Yeah, we're"
"5951880","5955440"," either going to get a whiplash higher here or we're going to get a fucking pretty bad."
"5955640","5958160"," It's either going to be going to be a bloodbath down here. "
"5958340","5960740"," It's going to be a pretty fucking severe whiplash up here."
"5961540","5966520"," So I'm either getting paid right now on this trip higher or I'm going to buy down here to cover"
"5966520","5967680"," my losses on this trade."
"5969420","5972000"," Now that we're going to find out they're going to take along. "
"5975640","5976440"," Trading 40882."
"5978460","5980120"," 40871 is the daily trigger."
"5980640","5981500"," Four more pennies to go. "
"5982460","5982860"," 40874."
"5983920","5986760"," Let me get an exact number on that, uh, on that Vix."
"5986860","5988060"," Make sure you got it right on the spot. "
"5988220","5988900"," Make sure you got it right."
"5993860","5994260"," 40848."
"5995640","5998040"," I was just eyeballing it. "
"5998460","6000000"," I got an exact number right now."
"6000120","6000460"," It's 48."
"6003700","6006760"," Breaking through the hourly trigger right now. "
"6006880","6008920"," Trading 40837."
"6009660","6012340"," Bloodbath in the S&P 500."
"6013560","6019740"," Certified bloodbath down, uh, points in 1.71% right now. "
"6024100","6026920"," But another 10 on 410 right now."
"6027740","6030040"," 54 or 50 cents at that point."
"6035380","6037140"," Bloodbath in the S&P 500. "
"6037940","6040000"," 11 o'clock in the morning."
"6040480","6042160"," Unreal right now watching this."
"6042980","6047300"," Down 1.73% in an hour and a half. "
"6048200","6051040"," Now 30 contracts on 410C."
"6056950","6058590"," No, that's not how it worked."
"6060670","6062930"," Yeah, did not take losses on longs here. "
"6063590","6065470"," I'm holding these fucking longs."
"6065470","6066610"," I'm not selling these today."
"6067050","6068550"," And I'll add down here too. "
"6069710","6071030"," I'll keep adding today."
"6072290","6073410"," I don't know."
"6073630","6075070"," I mean, unless there's something that we're not seeing. "
"6075770","6080230"," If we go down below 405 or 406, maybe there's something we don't know."
"6082590","6083550"," Back to short."
"6088410","6089310"," Fuck that. "
"6096290","6097130"," No, no, no, no."
"6097190","6103030"," I've got a 410s at, uh, like 40 some cents, 70 some cents."
"6103530","6104490"," I'm, uh, like 50. "
"6104690","6108230"," And I got a 90 cents or 94 cents or something like that."
"6108430","6111170"," So I'm down at like 60 or 70 cents right now."
"6112190","6112950"," Somewhere in there. "
"6113430","6114110"," A DCA."
"6125010","6126230"," That's only 30 contracts."
"6136600","6137460"," It's close enough. "
"6138740","6139620"," It's close enough."
"6139760","6144200"," We're either going to get a rip, rip face ripper up here or it's going to blood, blood bath down."
"6144360","6145480"," And there's going to be other face ripper. "
"6145760","6146900"," One was somewhere in here."
"6147040","6147740"," There's a face ripper."
"6147960","6149800"," So it's close and I'll take it. "
"6149960","6150920"," I'll take the risk here."
"6151520","6156860"," Unless there's something going on that I don't know unless there's like, uh, market crash scenario."
"6157720","6159380"," Uh, we're, we're pretty long with two. "
"6159460","6163900"," It's now 1104 and we're, we were down at one point."
"6165040","6165900"," It's pretty severe."
"6166680","6169360"," Uh, there'd have to be something, uh, material that we don't know. "
"6180190","6186050"," Yeah, I'll take the, I'll take the law of probability on us not seeing 4% by 12, 12 p "
"6186050","6188010",".m. I'll take that chance."
"6188930","6190170"," I'll take that trade every day."
"6190810","6193890"," If we did this every day, take this trade here every single day. "
"6194170","6195290"," That'd be fucking rich."
"6196410","6198630"," I don't want to hear anybody telling me."
"6199570","6205550"," At 11 o'clock in the morning being down two or 3% that we're going to continue lower ever. "
"6206110","6207030"," Well, not ever."
"6207390","6208650"," If the market's crashing, fuck."
"6208790","6209270"," Yeah, we can. "
"6210110","6211730"," Well, that's like COVID shit."
"6212930","6215030"," I'm going to see like 3, 4% a day."
"6215690","6217390"," I haven't seen that in three years. "
"6217870","6218450"," Sorry, buddy."
"6221710","6223190"," We ain't in those days anymore."
"6225290","6226770"," It's been, it's been three years. "
"6226770","6229970"," Since I've seen the S&P 500 get halted."
"6234110","6236630"," He want 50% in one day."
"6238530","6240970"," I'm going to go with by the fucking dip down here. "
"6245590","6247230"," Somewhere down here, like we're close."
"6247490","6247950"," It was a dollar."
"6248110","6248750"," I think it was not dollars. "
"6248950","6251190"," 1.8% or something."
"6252250","6254130"," It's only 11 o'clock in the morning."
"6255870","6258350"," You tell me we're going to do 5% in one day. "
"6258430","6260190"," We have a limit down in one day."
"6261070","6262310"," The day before FMC."
"6262310","6263590"," I'm going to think you're smoking crack. "
"6264950","6270050"," We could possibly do it in two or three days, but 11 a.m. I'll take that bet."
"6273490","6274830"," You're telling me there's a chance."
"6282690","6284250"," Yeah, it's possible. "
"6285090","6289950"," I would say if we went down 5% in one day that there's, I would say."
"6290650","6294630"," If we went down 5% in one day, we probably are getting rate cuts."
"6297270","6298350"," That's what I would expect. "
"6299210","6301390"," That's either something leaked."
"6303930","6308450"," Now if that happens and we get rate cuts and they know and we don't know."
"6308750","6309110"," Fuck dude. "
"6309810","6311170"," 5% one day shit."
"6311430","6314230"," We're going down like 30, 40%."
"6314230","6316150"," There'll be plenty of money we made in the downside. "
"6317590","6318810"," It's a whole ton of money."
"6326380","6326860"," I don't know."
"6326960","6335820"," Looking at the, I was talking about this morning on the open that I was like, I was like, damn,"
"6335860","6339140"," I feel like they trapped bulls on the day before FMC. "
"6340440","6341160"," Great decisions."
"6341480","6342100"," They went back and checked."
"6344180","6344980"," They don't. "
"6347000","6351320"," The market just follows its normal trend."
"6354870","6359250"," It doesn't like pinned to the FMC or Sal and FMC."
"6361150","6362390"," It just trades normal. "
"6363430","6365310"," Now, I'm not talking about the FMC meeting."
"6365990","6367790"," I'm talking about the FMC rate decisions."
"6369030","6370290"," Two different meetings. "
"6371170","6376410"," But I looked at the FMC rate decisions and they didn't."
"6377450","6381090"," The thing that me saying that yesterday was inaccurate."
"6381840","6389690"," But I did go back to check to because yesterday I was like, I was like, damn, I felt like"
"6389690","6393310"," we traded up into the day before FMC rate decisions. "
"6394030","6398370"," And then at like one in the afternoon, we would trap bulls."
"6399530","6404170"," And then I went looking and I'm like, no, we trade down into FMC rate decisions."
"6404590","6407030"," We traded up into FMC rate decisions. "
"6407990","6413530"," There was no like the only thing that I've ever taken away from."
"6414410","6415150"," Rate decisions."
"6417170","6422670"," Was the month before you trade, you trade up into those rate decisions. "
"6423150","6427710"," So you buy the minutes and you sell the, or excuse me, that you buy the meeting."
"6428270","6430970"," I mean, we rephrase this."
"6431330","6433690"," The way that you can kind of extrapolate here so far. "
"6435630","6441410"," Is like 70% of the time you buy the meeting like a month in advance."
"6442490","6446830"," You sell the minutes like 70% of the time."
"6448570","6455290"," That's the closest I could get to a correlation for fed meetings and fed minutes. "
"6455450","6459350"," But I went back and checked because I was like, do we sell the opener?"
"6459590","6461190"," Do we sell one in the afternoon today?"
"6462210","6464810"," And this morning we first started the broadcast."
"6465210","6468170"," I was like, I was like, I was like, they don't fuck it."
"6468210","6470890"," The market doesn't care about the FMC rate decision. "
"6471090","6473330"," It just trades out normally trades."
"6473810","6474110"," That's right."
"6474310","6477530"," I took away from going back and looking on those previous dates. "
"6478940","6481250"," We've traded right up into rate decisions."
"6483430","6487790"," We've traded down into rate decisions consistently both."
"6489510","6491970"," Trading 408.93 right now. "
"6494070","6497030"," Not sure still if we're going to get this last blast down."
"6498050","6499610"," Vic says it's possible."
"6500370","6506850"," So if it doesn't happen right now, I'm going to possibly expect it to happen later on in the day. "
"6508070","6510370"," Unless there's something fundamentally changes in the VIX."
"6513940","6515960"," Long 3410 C's here."
"6518200","6519920"," I don't know that we get back to 412. "
"6520560","6523220"," And even if we do, I would expect this to be the max."
"6524200","6527220"," I expect sellers to be here waiting above here at 412."
"6539220","6540420"," That's the move of the day, man. "
"6540580","6540880"," Good job."
"6541240","6541900"," Good job, solid."
"6542140","6548080"," If you bought zero date cop, what's yesterday on that close yesterday and yesterday's broadcast, I"
"6548080","6553000"," was like, I wish I had known that information yesterday during the close because yesterday I was"
"6553000","6557620"," under the impression that, um, that they don't give a fuck. "
"6557800","6561840"," If we're trading up, they don't care about the rate decisions."
"6562600","6566000"," Because yesterday at the close, in this live stream, I was like, man, normally I'd be taking some"
"6566000","6567460"," zero date puts here in this bell."
"6568180","6569560"," It was just too fucking juicy. "
"6571260","6576700"," And then I was like, yeah, every time I fucking wanted to chase the whole on Friday's, but on"
"6576700","6577000"," closes."
"6578140","6579360"," It's not fucking worth the money."
"6579700","6584100"," I ended up getting torched the last 10 times chasing the whole haven't paid. "
"6585100","6587020"," Well, they didn't dump futures this morning."
"6587220","6588680"," We'll come at four o'clock this morning, man."
"6588900","6592200"," Like this morning at four a.m. I was like, I'm going to wake up and I'm going to look"
"6592200","6594300"," and see if they start selling this shit. "
"6595240","6597800"," Like four at four fifteen, no sign of it."
"6598460","6604060"," Then on the bell today, the only sign of a selling off in this bell was E.S. S.P "
"6604060","6611300",".X. and spy all had a negative bearish hourly divergence and it also had a three trigger cluster to"
"6611300","6613240"," the downside on the open."
"6615140","6617820"," I caught a little bit of this move, but not all of it. "
"6621010","6623150"," But I have no interest in trading this."
"6623330","6625370"," I have no interest in this last leg down here."
"6626050","6629690"," I only have interest in buying this dip here or buying this dip right here. "
"6640960","6642900"," Yeah, these swellers are now down here."
"6643060","6644220"," These guys have moved down."
"6645700","6646860"," They're now down here. "
"6646980","6647620"," These are the big boys."
"6647920","6649020"," They do all their leg workouts."
"6651500","6652520"," Oh, hold on here. "
"6658350","6659730"," Yeah, they're right down here."
"6660950","6662190"," Good job, south side."
"6662990","6663430"," Congratulations. "
"6669900","6671000"," You tried short."
"6671160","6671460"," Yeah, dude."
"6671580","6676380"," I watched futures last night and I was like, I almost made a post last night about futures. "
"6677400","6678400"," Because I was like, fuck me."
"6678560","6679940"," I was like, they got rocked last night."
"6680240","6685300"," Well, when I looked, I think futures were down like point two and then they were like flat. "
"6685300","6686700"," It was like point."
"6687120","6691460"," It was like point two or something that it was like point zero four point zero two."
"6691840","6693500"," And I was like, I couldn't last night. "
"6693580","6696060"," I was like, I can't believe anyone's awake doing this shit right now."
"6696580","6701140"," I even downloaded a meme for it because I was like, I was like, you're getting, you got, you got"
"6701140","6702260"," shafted in the overnight."
"6704320","6706820"," And then this morning at four AM, I checked again. "
"6707420","6711220"," It's like, I was like, they haven't sold this shit at four AM either."
"6728380","6733880"," Yeah, that is so if you have Goldman Sachs is saying 2023 rate cuts are less likely than investors"
"6733880","6735840"," think that means market goes up."
"6736580","6739920"," Like any kind of pause market goes up or my view. "
"6740480","6743540"," If there's any kind of pause the market go market goes up."
"6743720","6748800"," If there's any kind of rate hike and discussion of a pause market goes up."
"6749000","6754720"," We can have weakness, you know, weakness from a rate increase, but we're not getting the blood. "
"6754920","6756180"," We're not getting the crash."
"6757940","6762820"," From a rate pause and we're not getting a crash from 25 BPS."
"6763300","6765940"," We're not getting a crash from 50 BPS. "
"6768160","6774160"," Well, the only thing that I would think where you get it like the last leg down."
"6775340","6777760"," That capitulation move that everybody wants."
"6778780","6783460"," I don't think that begins until we get a rate cut. "
"6784180","6787100"," And I do think when that we get that rate cut."
"6787100","6792860"," There'll still be a face rip and rally before it happens, so there'll be a squeeze for liquidity on"
"6792860","6793120"," high."
"6794440","6796020"," And then a major bloodbath. "
"6801140","6808160"," Rate cuts to me brings a bloodbath pausing as long as they talk about if they have a pausing rate"
"6808160","6808880"," increases."
"6810160","6811860"," It's all positive for the market."
"6813500","6821400"," The only downside that I see to this rate pause is, as I mentioned earlier was if they pause rates,"
"6821400","6825860"," it will add some volatility in the market whenever we come into a meeting. "
"6827600","6832060"," Because you're then going to go into every meeting with, hey, are we getting a rate increase or is"
"6832060","6833080"," it situation normal?"
"6833960","6839440"," That would be a major shift because right now we're like told we're like, hey, expect us to go to"
"6839440","6840160"," five, right?"
"6841280","6844540"," Expect 50 BPS, expect 25 BPS."
"6845920","6851480"," So when you start to pause shit, like if they were to come out tomorrow and be like, expect 25,"
"6851820","6860540"," expect pause, expect, I don't know, a terminal rate and other, you know, I don't know, 100 BPS in a"
"6860540","6864120"," year or two, that would lend stability to the market as well."
"6865700","6867720"," Because you kind of anticipate it, right?"
"6867840","6870040"," You price it in, you know what's coming. "
"6871320","6877400"," Another 200 BPS over the course of three years, even something like that would actually be"
"6877400","6878460"," supportive of the market."
"6878460","6885680"," I know that sounds crazy, but the fact is that the market's showing you that right now, right?"
"6885820","6888540"," The market's showing you that the business cycles have continued on."
"6889400","6891260"," People are putting risk into the market. "
"6891260","6893860"," They're getting chewed up out there trying to beat inflation."
"6894680","6902520"," I am fascinated right now, though, with what Nick Temeros said this morning because, you know, the"
"6902520","6907140"," real, they kind of touched upon it in this article, but not really."
"6909760","6916040"," And now this is where the crowd that says, if we cut rates, the market will go up. "
"6917480","6922680"," I believe that, but I do believe that there's a capitulation moment before it does go up."
"6923060","6928040"," If you were long this market and they cut rates and it did roll over, I wouldn't sell."
"6928240","6928800"," I would just hold. "
"6929720","6934400"," I would think that like a month and a half later, two months later, the market would rebound and be"
"6934400","6935500"," right back where it was."
"6936460","6938220"," Believe it or not, like come right back."
"6939500","6945600"," So if you're like long shares, long long, the underlying stock, whatever it is, ETN, I don't know,"
"6945760","6950520"," fucking Bitcoin or some kind of shit coin. "
"6950680","6954260"," Unless your shit gets repriced, that wouldn't be long on an individual ticker if that happened,"
"6954360","6954460"," though."
"6955080","6956200"," Maybe the S&P 500."
"6957660","6959320"," You know they ain't repriced in that shit. "
"6961360","6964820"," So you might have like that one month and a half of weakness, two months of weakness, something"
"6964820","6966520"," like that, but then it kind of should come right back."
"6970200","6979480"," But yeah, I mean, if they're not going to fight inflation, I feel like we're cutting."
"6980540","6983500"," They're not going to fight inflation, man, like that was the whole premise, right?"
"6983680","6984620"," We know that that was a lie. "
"6986920","6989040"," We know that we know that was a lie."
"6995250","6996150"," Wait a minute here."
"6997810","6999390"," We know they're not going to fight inflation. "
"7001570","7007770"," All they're going to fucking do is, all they're going to fucking do is they're going to wait until"
"7007770","7009030"," you accept inflation."
"7013530","7015290"," Wait until wages get up there."
"7017170","7020410"," Until you can afford to pay for six dollar eggs. "
"7022390","7023510"," Four dollar eggs."
"7025790","7029710"," I think I remember like eggs were like a dollar just what a few years ago."
"7031930","7041150"," My local store, the free range shit is cheaper than what used to be like the dollar eggs. "
"7041510","7043270"," The free range is actually cheaper right now."
"7045450","7047310"," So if they're going to stop fighting inflation."
"7049310","7055490"," I was saying that the credit crunch will do it to the rest of the forum, but we know that's"
"7055490","7056070"," a fucking lie. "
"7057810","7059150"," You can go back and look at."
"7060450","7061630"," Go back and look at anything."
"7062630","7064050"," Have you ever seen a 30 cents hand?"
"7064130","7066530"," It was last time we saw a 30 cent hamburger at McDonald's. "
"7067530","7068790"," You'll never see that shit again."
"7071210","7074030"," So when they tell you that they're going to fight inflation, it's a crack of shit."
"7075650","7076950"," A fraud will go on. "
"7077250","7085110"," Now the point behind that is this would be the only argument that the rate cut bulls have."
"7086590","7088510"," They're betting they're gambling based."
"7088730","7089410"," That's a bet though. "
"7089570","7092910"," They're betting they're like, yeah, we're not going to get that last capitulation."
"7092910","7094990"," We're just going to rip faces off to all time eyes again."
"7097250","7097690"," Maybe. "
"7099850","7100670"," It's possible."
"7100870","7104010"," I guess I wouldn't put my eggs into it."
"7104990","7107350"," If you did, I would and we rolled over. "
"7107350","7112150"," I would just hold because I do think it comes back because they are right to some extent."
"7112150","7116110"," If you stop fighting inflation, there is some truth there."
"7117530","7123190"," Because when your dollar is worth shit, that means they increase the prices of stocks. "
"7126030","7130090"," It means your apple stock is worth less for the dollars that you paid for it."
"7131070","7134830"," So it has to be repriced to your worthless dollar."
"7165030","7166770"," Do you want to see the Algo?"
"7167490","7168570"," Let's look at the Algo. "
"7181040","7182200"," See the Algo same."
"7204640","7206860"," Yeah, the Algo still has a step for 20."
"7214160","7215260"," Let's look at the Algo. "
"7227640","7231160"," So trend not broken yet on S&P 500."
"7236770","7238610"," Here's the S&P 500 right here."
"7241870","7244250"," May 5th, claiming we're going to 420. "
"7244930","7249150"," And furthermore, now this is regressive here."
"7249350","7250650"," See these Xs right here?"
"7252430","7258050"," So this is a progressive or something and this is regressive down below."
"7258790","7267210"," If you notice the white Xs and the red Xs down here, this would be where if we are regressive,"
"7267850","7269730"," we come down and bounce here. "
"7271870","7278470"," That's at 392ish, 395, 386 somewhere in there."
"7280970","7287610"," The auto regressive and then we're still in trend and it's saying we're going to 420."
"7288970","7295210"," So maybe there's news we don't know coming out tomorrow that's going to make the market just scream"
"7295210","7297050"," rip faces off to the upside. "
"7298010","7307960"," The one thing with this Algo is one thing with this Algo is"
"7307960","7310060"," we can have the argument that the Algo is wrong."
"7310060","7313580"," And then we change our opinion and two didn't one day."
"7314820","7316660"," We wake up tomorrow and it's like 420. "
"7317100","7317800"," We're like, oh shit."
"7318720","7323460"," We actually tagged 420 on SPX or ES yesterday, didn't we?"
"7324500","7325440"," I think we did."
"7326880","7328420"," Let me look at ES real quick. "
"7328780","7330560"," I think we tagged it yesterday on ES at least."
"7334520","7336420"," We tagged 420 on ES yesterday?"
"7337280","7337840"," Anybody know?"
"7337840","7340000"," I think that we did."
"7350860","7362660"," And we"
"7362660","7372380"," tagged 420650, 420650 on ES"
"7372380","7372820"," at least. "
"7383400","7395180"," SPX tagged 418 7.15. VIX"
"7395180","7399380"," still pumping right now and the five minutes now coming up on VIX."
"7410570","7414630"," Here's your gap fill down below 4054840601."
"7419780","7421260"," This is your gap right here. "
"7423140","7424180"," Turn that gray."
"7436120","7438360"," This is the promise for the bears down here."
"7454720","7456420"," There's a 4206 here. "
"7470560","7472540"," Yeah, I'm on calls right now, Binky."
"7474000","7475100"," I'm long here, man."
"7475100","7480020"," And I'll get some weekly calls down here at 40645 if I can. "
"7516110","7517290"," I'm just waiting now."
"7518610","7522030"," I'm waiting for people that are short to get trapped here and fuel this rip higher."
"7583020","7584320"," Just waiting here. "
"7592080","7593900"," Well, you guys get so bearish."
"7595160","7599260"," You guys are calling for like 5% limit downs on spy today."
"7599260","7601600"," It's pretty wild to hear that. "
"7604960","7607740"," You guys are calling for like 5% days and shit."
"7609240","7611040"," I'm looking to buy a dip down here."
"7611520","7615200"," You guys are all like, again, we're going to fucking 380 tomorrow. "
"7647740","7650120"," Hey, Connor, I've got a bunch of videos on that, man."
"7658120","7659740"," Yeah, I'm long right here, Eugene."
"7669200","7670080"," I'm long calls. "
"7670960","7672020"," I'm out of puts at this point."
"7690320","7694000"," Fed swaps price in bigger decline in rates from expected peak."
"7719020","7720640"," Not much going on right now. "
"7725770","7728010"," I've got a 34."
"7729950","7732130"," I've got 3410 C's."
"7732410","7732970"," Excuse me. "
"7734690","7737110"," 3410 C's that I've decayed into."
"7738730","7741930"," I think that we're going to rotate and go higher here."
"7742370","7743970"," At least up to this 412 area. "
"7744830","7746590"," These swellers have come down now."
"7748190","7748790"," 41076."
"7750170","7757210"," If we trade down to fill the gap down below here at 405406, I'll enter some more calls for Friday"
"7757210","7760230"," down here at 4054840601. "
"7762550","7766870"," So either way, I'm long on zero dates here or I'm long on weeklies down below."
"7786750","7788810"," Yeah, they're the vids that are going."
"7788810","7791670"," This is going back to like June and October, man. "
"7791670","7794970"," Like every time we hit a low in June and October, we're buying those dips."
"7796390","7798290"," We bought December as well."
"7799350","7802230"," We talked all about the inverted yield curve. "
"7803110","7806650"," Fed funds rate at employment rate."
"7808210","7809310"," Inflate rate of inflation."
"7813030","7817310"," We look back into the 1950s, 60s, 70s, all that stuff. "
"7817610","7818290"," Just a long conversation."
"7819450","7820970"," It takes like two hours to talk about."
"7821590","7823610"," I think we've talked about it nauseating at this point. "
"7827900","7834960"," There's some kind of an argument here for a rate cut and then we just go."
"7835400","7836940"," But I don't see it."
"7837220","7838800"," I mean, I'd like to see that bottom. "
"7840260","7842080"," That capitulation moved down on rate cuts."
"7847700","7849280"," We saw this over for you."
"7850440","7852080"," I'll show you guys the VIX real quick. "
"7855920","7862960"," This is where the bears have one, possibly one more."
"7864560","7866420"," So this is the VIX weekly right here."
"7867100","7868060"," This is an important level. "
"7868800","7871540"," It's a very emotional level for traders, for bears."
"7872560","7873800"," For bulls, doesn't matter."
"7874540","7876120"," This goes for spy as well. "
"7877000","7877960"," This would be that last."
"7878420","7881920"," If the five minute and one, like the one minute's already up there."
"7882400","7886820"," If there can be some consolidation here and you see the five minute get above the daily. "
"7887320","7889900"," It's possible that there's one more rip higher for the VIX."
"7890160","7892640"," And that would give that last bloodbath down on the spy."
"7893560","7896200"," So I'm paying attention to this right now to see if that happens. "
"7896200","7902680"," And there's your 20, 2021 on VIX."
"7903120","7907660"," 43% the lowest since April the 26th."
"7908500","7920580"," A quick rip load of 407.82. That"
"7920580","7922700"," had 410 C at 37 cents. "
"7925340","7928060"," Now I'm on 40 contracts, 410 C."
"7960240","7963000"," Now I'm seeing articles from Janet Lee Ellen again."
"7963600","7967060"," Janet Yellen warned us could run out of cash by June 1st."
"7968140","7970520"," Like I just can't believe she's saying this shit. "
"7978220","7980480"," Like listen to the diarrhea, come out of her mouth."
"7981860","7985160"," I'm like, I can't, like I was reading it yesterday."
"7985420","7988640"," I was reading the discussion around her comments yesterday. "
"7989380","7994320"," And I wanted to like vomit in a bag and then drink it all and then revominate it all back"
"7994320","7995260"," up and drink it all."
"7996360","8000640"," It might have been the most diarrhea I've heard in some time."
"8013110","8014570"," Yeah, she didn't spook markets. "
"8015190","8015850"," It's intended."
"8019110","8023950"," It's not so it's bizarre because you have a lot of uneducated."
"8025410","8026010"," Inexperienced. "
"8027190","8028810"," And then you've got political."
"8031610","8036070"," You know, it's not so it's trying to come up with a way to describe her comments."
"8041410","8043990"," It's it's kind of like yelling fire. "
"8044810","8048350"," In a movie theater and they're not being a fire."
"8050730","8052470"," That's pretty much what it is."
"8053390","8056890"," It's yelling fire in a movie theater and they're not being a fire. "
"8057410","8059070"," And so if there's no fire."
"8060230","8066730"," But the conversation is focused on their being a fire that people know is not there."
"8067550","8069470"," That's where it gets kind of fucked up. "
"8070790","8073490"," You're like, why are we even discussing this?"
"8073690","8074670"," There's no fire over there."
"8075410","8078930"," And yet there's so let's say we're all sitting in a movie theater and yelling is in the corner and"
"8078930","8080270"," she's just screaming fire."
"8082230","8086370"," We turn the lights on and you look over and you see it's yelling screaming and you're like, why are"
"8086370","8086730"," you screaming?"
"8087950","8096550"," And then like five people next to you turn to each other and they start to discuss if"
"8096550","8098570"," there's a fire. "
"8098990","8099770"," And you're like, wait a minute."
"8099930","8102070"," You go turn to the five people and you go, there is no fire."
"8103030","8105390"," And they're like, well, what if there is you're like, well, there's no smoke. "
"8106730","8107650"," There's no flames."
"8108690","8111650"," And there's a crazy person over there claiming there's a fire."
"8114030","8117730"," And they're like, and instead of discussing the crazy person discussing the fire. "
"8118750","8119950"," People are like, now fuck that."
"8120070","8120610"," We're going to discuss."
"8120890","8121410"," There's a fire. "
"8121430","8124870"," And I'm like, but there isn't a fire and there's no smoke."
"8125870","8128030"," So why are we discussing a fucking fire?"
"8133490","8143400"," And the worst part is, if you're only a low, if you have like"
"8143400","8153240"," a low understanding of the debt ceiling, it's even worse because"
"8153240","8159960"," then your brain is being rotted by conversation that means nothing."
"8161400","8166440"," And some of the conversations I heard about, I was reading conversations on ready yesterday and I"
"8166440","8170580"," was like, man, there's a whole bunch of people in here just trying to push political agendas. "
"8171380","8174940"," There's a whole bunch of people in here that have zero concept to what they're talking about."
"8175660","8177220"," There's a bunch of fair mongering."
"8177560","8180940"," And then there's like a bunch of people that are just consuming and being like, fuck yeah, I'm"
"8180940","8181780"," drinking that Kool-Aid. "
"8182620","8184180"," I'm like, this is crazy town."
"8184180","8188020"," You're a fucking crazy town."
"8195299","8197000"," Hagerty knows what I'm talking about. "
"8198420","8200020"," I'm like, this is insane."
"8200820","8203219"," Like the fact that we're even discussing this is insane."
"8204219","8210000"," Like if they were discussing, if they were discussing in this comments, in this discussion thread,"
"8210760","8213120"," how fucking crazy is what she's saying?"
"8214459","8216240"," I'd be like, yeah, this is constructive. "
"8218820","8222100"," I'll join in in this conversation because this is crazy town."
"8225719","8227440"," Or why it's being said."
"8228400","8231639"," If they were discussing that, like, hey, why is Jenny Ellen saying this?"
"8232500","8235180"," I'd be like, fuck yeah, let's talk about it because that's important. "
"8237200","8242600"," It has zero to do, zero to do with like the reality."
"8242600","8244120"," There is no fucking fire."
"8244680","8246520"," There'll never be a fucking fire. "
"8248459","8250719"," We are never running out of cash."
"8251520","8252500"," So I'm sorry."
"8253240","8255400"," And that's the headline right now. "
"8255480","8257600"," I'm reading it right now on BBC News."
"8258240","8259040"," Debt Sailing."
"8259840","8260340"," Janet Yellen. "
"8261020","8263379"," Warren's US could run a cash by John June 1."
"8263680","8264719"," Suck my balls."
"8265379","8267340"," We're running out of cash on June 1."
"8274280","8275860"," It's like crazy person talk."
"8276340","8280360"," If I was like, some guy told me that in the street, I'd be like, get the fuck out of"
"8280360","8280520"," here. "
"8283200","8285000"," And we didn't even give you five minutes."
"8285760","8286580"," We'd get out of my face."
"8294850","8296330"," Yeah, Damien's saying it right now. "
"8296889","8298309"," What's funny is that it works."
"8298950","8302950"," Do you know that the debt ceiling has never, in one instance, not been raised?"
"8305770","8308389"," But yet it's a think every few years or so."
"8308889","8310209"," How do people fall for it?"
"8310389","8311090"," I don't fucking know. "
"8311309","8318469"," Well, the scary part to me was, so the scary, Damien, the scary part to me was that most people"
"8318469","8320170"," I thought knew this."
"8321309","8324889"," In this discussion thread, there was like real panic."
"8324889","8327270"," And I was like, the fuck is wrong with people. "
"8328010","8334049"," I was like, we need better, we need like economics 101, 102, 103 and 104 mandated."
"8334650","8340190"," Four years of high school, like fucking freshman year, sophomore year, junior year, senior year."
"8341290","8351150"," Like, absolutely, absolutely need that because like the basic understanding"
"8351150","8357030"," of the economy by people, it is, it's lower than like knowing your politics. "
"8357469","8362570"," It's lower than, uh, it's, it's, I'm going to assume that."
"8362870","8364410"," I'm not, I'm making an assumption here."
"8365770","8366490"," Oh, yeah. "
"8366590","8367870"," Look at that reversal right there, baby."
"8368110","8368809"," Just keep on squeezing."
"8369230","8370250"," Oh, yeah. "
"8370709","8371950"," Trade 56 cents and fortunes."
"8372670","8378110"," Um, like, like everybody takes English."
"8378430","8378969"," They take math. "
"8379309","8379830"," They take science."
"8379830","8381930"," He'll basic understandings of science, right?"
"8384049","8385809"," Most people not a boil water."
"8387410","8391870"," Uh, yeah, like, yeah, I don't know. "
"8393310","8395930"," Most people don't know how to like fucking jump rope."
"8397130","8399330"," They take a physical education class."
"8399550","8401530"," I guess they've done away with a lot of that shit too, but. "
"8402390","8404270"," You know, like most people have."
"8406390","8408770"," Base understandings of, uh."
"8409210","8413690"," I don't know, man. "
"8414070","8416270"," Like the stuff I was reading yesterday."
"8417250","8417890"," Scared me."
"8420330","8421870"," It really scared me. "
"8422110","8424090"," And these people were fucking scared, man."
"8424450","8427450"," I was like, I was like, and they're drinking the Kool-Aid too."
"8427550","8428270"," That's the scary part. "
"8428910","8429850"," Wasn't so much they were scared."
"8430050","8432070"," It was that people were like, hey, you want some more?"
"8432170","8433090"," You want another cup of that shit?"
"8433090","8435070"," Let me go fucking pour you some."
"8435730","8439550"," They're like, guess what happens when they don't, when they don't, uh, raise the debt ceiling. "
"8439550","8440310"," Guess what happens then?"
"8443010","8447250"," They're like, uh, the US dollar is not the world currency anymore."
"8447950","8448910"," China takes over."
"8449670","8450950"," I'm like, yeah, that's going to fucking happen. "
"8451750","8454510"," I'm like, what the fuck is going to war over that shit, dude?"
"8455270","8456950"," Like World War III over that shit."
"8457690","8459650"," That shit ain't fucking happening."
"8463630","8469870"," Talking about hegemony, you're talking about hundred fucking years of trying to be the fucking"
"8469870","8471190"," leader of the free world. "
"8471530","8476790"," You can fucking put that rock in your crack pipe and smoke it all day long all you want, but"
"8476790","8478290"," don't make it so."
"8479150","8480030"," I don't know."
"8480550","8486170"," You can go back to every civilization in this world since day one. "
"8486170","8491870"," Since there was a tribe of two, two people and two people and they fought over seashells."
"8494170","8501530"," And you think like, you think some person and some house rep or some senator is going to destroy"
"8501530","8502190"," that hegemony?"
"8502630","8503710"," Fuck on out of here."
"8506170","8507030"," Smokin' crack. "
"8514070","8515710"," Yeah, but even in that brinksmanship."
"8517570","8525570"," Even in that brinksmanship, it makes the stock market weak for a month, which we normally have,"
"8525710","8525850"," right?"
"8526110","8526390"," Volatility."
"8527670","8529630"," It doesn't impact our economy. "
"8529990","8537630"," They still pass a bill for the time that they're arguing, even in those situations."
"8538270","8544130"," So even in that brinksmanship, the arguments that were happening in this discussion had nothing to"
"8544130","8545070"," do with the stock market."
"8545070","8546510"," It was just pure. "
"8546770","8552910"," I mean, it read like reading like a, it read like you were reading like a, what's that guy's name?"
"8553030","8553790"," What's that guy's name?"
"8553950","8554770"," The Sandy Hook guy?"
"8555430","8555930"," Fucking."
"8557710","8559990"," Like that crackpot, whatever his name is."
"8561870","8565090"," The guy with like the red face and shit screaming all the time. "
"8566150","8569050"," Like that, and these were like normal people."
"8569650","8573090"," And they sounded like that guy."
"8578730","8583730"," Squeezing higher now trading 409.30. 410 sees it. "
"8584270","8585330"," 66 cents."
"8585970","8586910"," 67 cents."
"8593920","8596800"," We'll see if the swellers give it up up here or not. "
"8600930","8602290"," Alex Jones, exactly."
"8604350","8607630"," I just listened to a comedian talk about him the other day."
"8607650","8608550"," This guy's a liberal too. "
"8609050","8610710"," And he was making comedy about Alex Jones."
"8612150","8613850"," It was, it was fucking hilarious."
"8621230","8622730"," I'll have to find out who this guy was. "
"8622830","8623930"," Let me see if I can find this guy's name."
"8624650","8625650"," I'll put it in these."
"8626350","8629350"," This will make you laugh if you're a Democrat or Republican. "
"8629530","8630090"," It ain't going to matter."
"8631510","8633350"," But it is going to make you laugh your ass off."
"8634510","8634970"," Hold on. "
"8635030","8636010"," I'll see if you can find this guy."
"8636690","8638330"," Listen to the whole thing too."
"8638430","8641790"," Listen like the beginning of this guy right to the end. "
"8642590","8643930"," It was fucking hilarious."
"8646410","8650190"," And he's like, if I want crazy, I don't know what you guys watch it."
"8650270","8651170"," Let me see if I can find it right here. "
"8654570","8655010"," Really?"
"8655170","8655690"," One second here."
"8657370","8658450"," In your free time."
"8658550","8660530"," If you have a spare 10 minutes today, take a break. "
"8665570","8669860"," Here, I'll put a link to it."
"8677100","8681420"," Here, I'm going to put a link to, I think, I don't, I don't think it matters if, you know,"
"8681480","8684920"," like, there's always division amongst liberals and conservatives and."
"8686040","8689120"," MAGA and I don't know, fucking fascists and fucking. "
"8689780","8692120"," Hitler people and I don't know."
"8692960","8694140"," Everybody's always fighting, right?"
"8695200","8697520"," This, this, this, this comedian is hilarious."
"8698120","8702920"," You might find, I don't think it matters what your, what your normal, like, your main street hat"
"8702920","8703200"," is. "
"8703300","8704320"," I think you're going to find this funny."
"8705480","8707740"," I think you'll get a good lot of this unless you're really fucking crazy."
"8708800","8709920"," Like you're truly crazy. "
"8710720","8711760"," You might not get it."
"8714280","8715580"," But you might find this funny."
"8715580","8718680"," I was posted a link to it. "
"8721820","8723480"," Oh, come on, dude."
"8729260","8731300"," I'm going to have to sit here all day long."
"8735180","8737020"," So much drama here. "
"8738940","8742680"," You're not getting 5% the day before."
"8742980","8743960"," I apologize bears."
"8746660","8749560"," You might get two, two and a half, possibly three. "
"8750360","8754940"," You're not getting fucking five and six percent in a day."
"8757220","8758960"," This isn't fucking COVID, man."
"8760760","8764200"," Oh, you guys know, you guys know, come town. "
"8774630","8779570"," Hey, Mike, how's it going?"
"8784030","8786130"," You guys want like 5% one day."
"8790230","8791710"," Hopefully you closed your shorts."
"8792830","8795010"," Hopefully closed your puts took the money and ran. "
"8799070","8800730"," The dump sick innocent."
"8806420","8808660"," I'd like to get up to this 410 40 at least."
"8809420","8811000"," No, I think we can go higher than that. "
"8811200","8811880"," There's another tag."
"8813540","8815100"," There's some room to go higher."
"8815560","8818320"," I was thinking to hold them to the end of the day, too. "
"8818980","8820060"," It's a pretty big steep."
"8820340","8821640"," It's a pretty big move down."
"8824120","8826340"," It's a pretty big move down to not. "
"8827720","8829380"," Let's, let me look and see."
"8830020","8832200"," Let me just take a look here."
"8839970","8841950"," Return to the scene of crime, probably not. "
"8841950","8846740"," Yeah, maybe."
"8848020","8851120"," 410 34 has a nice ring to it."
"8852700","8855800"," Consolidate and then maybe trade sideways into the bell. "
"8857420","8860480"," 410 34 is a nice, nice place to take it."
"8860780","8862800"," Although this is a little dramatic here."
"8864000","8865440"," This is a little dramatic. "
"8868460","8870680"," If you're going to reset to short."
"8872600","8875020"," Right now it's at now it's at 410 27."
"8875020","8876840"," So 410 ish somewhere in here. "
"8877300","8878180"," It's moving down."
"8878600","8880840"," These bears are going to, these, what these bears want to do."
"8881560","8883080"," Like what Southside wants to do. "
"8884680","8886740"," Is sell this down and hit this."
"8887580","8889500"," Whether now or into the close."
"8890660","8892660"," I don't know that they get it up to measure it. "
"8892760","8894280"," Let me see if I can, let me measure it real quick."
"8896140","8898780"," And see if there's a chance of actually hitting that."
"8898780","8900340"," 405 48. "
"8903460","8905100"," You know, just one day declines."
"8906080","8908000"," It's long in the fucking tooth, man."
"8909700","8914040"," I would, I would think as a seller, your best bet is that we pin. "
"8916920","8919520"," Well, you could, you could make a claim that we're going to pin."
"8920220","8921420"," What is that 405?"
"8925980","8927460"," It's roughly two."
"8927800","8928780"," Don't, don't pin me to this. "
"8928960","8936120"," It's like 2.16%. 2.3. That's reasonable for a daily decline."
"8938840","8939960"," Where is that?"
"8941260","8942420"," 448 I mean."
"8944220","8948540"," It's like 2.22%. I'm not against. "
"8952100","8955300"," I'm not against like a decline in the bell like this."
"8957440","8960780"," Like 2% down, 2.5% down the day is reasonable."
"8961780","8965680"," Like when you start talking about like 3% for 5% we really need. "
"8966060","8967720"," There's either some we don't know."
"8968400","8972340"," Really negative or we're going to rip some fucking faces off on this."
"8974180","8975500"," On this news. "
"8975900","8977800"," There could be something that we don't know."
"8978460","8980300"," I'm assuming that something is leaked."
"8981240","8986320"," That's where my point here is if we decline 3% or 2.3% today. "
"8986860","8991200"," And then you're expecting like another 2% or 3%, like a 5% move tomorrow."
"8991680","8993040"," Between yesterday and tomorrow."
"8995680","8996480"," Something's leaked. "
"8998320","8998520"," So."
"9003360","9005100"," So what does that mean?"
"9005620","9009180"," I would say that the worst case scenario for bears."
"9010220","9014640"," Is that we like the worst or the worst case for bears that we trade sideways up in here. "
"9015020","9016000"," Into the bell today."
"9016820","9021200"," Best case for bears is that we trade down into this bell to 40546."
"9022240","9023920"," Unless there's something we don't know. "
"9024680","9025500"," That's possible."
"9025700","9027740"," It's possible man that they're going to come into that meeting."
"9028900","9031280"," That we don't know and they're going to talk about a cut. "
"9032140","9033260"," If they cut."
"9034020","9037680"," I'm very bearish on a rate cut."
"9039020","9040540"," Extremely bearish in a rate cut. "
"9042680","9045280"," But other than that this is all semantics to me."
"9046700","9048760"," Now if price gets above."
"9050400","9052940"," At any point today where these swellers are. "
"9053400","9056320"," There's going to be a massive squeeze on high."
"9058500","9061680"," So other than that this is all semantics to me."
"9061920","9063940"," If we can get down to 40546. "
"9065360","9067300"," I'm still extremely bullish down here."
"9067460","9070980"," So I'll probably pick up a weekly calls for Friday or some down here."
"9074180","9076960"," Unless there's going to be something material that we don't know. "
"9081780","9083860"," Yeah, I'm not listening to your gap down scenarios."
"9084140","9084620"," I don't want to hear it."
"9084980","9086280"," I don't want to hear a gap down. "
"9086280","9089160"," I don't want to hear like I don't want to hear the nonsense."
"9091580","9092520"," I'll say this."
"9093180","9094780"," I shouldn't I shouldn't just wave you off. "
"9095700","9098600"," If you gap us down right we get to 25 in the VIX."
"9099040","9100740"," I'll probably put my whole account in long."
"9102180","9103000"," That's my point. "
"9103620","9108780"," If we can make VIX at 25 to 28 in two days."
"9110040","9111900"," I'm going to long this fucking market all day long."
"9113980","9115520"," We're not going to 30 in my view. "
"9117100","9118880"," We'll go to like 25 to 28."
"9119260","9120260"," Two days to do that."
"9123700","9128180"," I'm trying to look at this like just another dip buying opportunity. "
"9129160","9131260"," I want you to know and be clear with you out there."
"9132200","9135680"," I am not bearish in any way shape or form."
"9138480","9139800"," Zero bearish in this air. "
"9140980","9144100"," None in any kind of any kind of decline that's like that."
"9144100","9146940"," Like we get a 28 25 VIX."
"9147300","9148460"," I'm extremely bullish. "
"9149700","9151720"," I'm not on board with 3600."
"9152120","9153800"," I'm not on board with 3800."
"9154320","9158060"," I'm not on board with going below 396 in any way shape or form. "
"9158420","9161160"," There would have to be something material that we don't know."
"9168090","9169770"," Material like something that you don't know."
"9170030","9170990"," Something that I don't know. "
"9172050","9174810"," Some kind of fucking horrific news that has been told."
"9175470","9176830"," And regional banks aren't it."
"9177490","9179230"," And the debt ceiling is not it. "
"9180070","9183050"," And a 25 basis point rate hike is not it."
"9183790","9186910"," Now there has to be something more significant."
"9189070","9192770"," I apologize if you don't, if you disagree with me, I understand completely. "
"9193510","9194670"," I'm not trying to wave you off either."
"9194670","9196970"," I think I was being dismissive and I shouldn't be."
"9197730","9199810"," But I'm not in that camp at all. "
"9201870","9205350"," As a matter of fact, I can show you the last time that people were in that camp."
"9205550","9207770"," They got fucking torched last week."
"9209710","9211610"," They got fucking torched. "
"9214370","9216370"," Like two days later we went up like what?"
"9216670","9218270"," Three or four or five percent or something stupid."
"9219150","9220070"," So I just don't want to hear it."
"9221390","9225630"," As a matter of fact, we were right here the last time that happened. "
"9228090","9229630"," We were exactly right here."
"9233170","9238460"," We ripped some fucking faces off."
"9238620","9239420"," It was gnarly. "
"9242420","9244460"," So I've got no I've got no wants."
"9245480","9248020"," No wants to sell this market on the daily trigger."
"9248680","9254180"," No wants on like 20, 30 points to risk that. "
"9264970","9266550"," Now I think bears can get the 396."
"9267770","9269250"," I think that's on the table."
"9270430","9273190"," I think like a capitulation between six is definitely doable. "
"9274610","9280870"," But like the 380s, 378s, 360s, you need something material."
"9283850","9287570"," You need like, you need like institutions selling into each other."
"9288670","9290590"," So there have to be some, something we don't know. "
"9301800","9302320"," Hold on."
"9302380","9303540"," I got to make a phone call real quick."
"9303780","9304320"," Give me one second. "
"9604530","9605090"," All right."
"9605490","9609710"," So what I'm going to do is I'm going to put on, I'm going to put on CNBC live right"
"9609710","9610010"," now."
"9612110","9615130"," And well, you know, it sucks is, I'm just going to pipe this in. "
"9615250","9615710"," Hold on a second."
"9630050","9631310"," Give me a second here."
"9636320","9640660"," So according to the Wall Street Journal, House Democrats are trying to force a vote on clean debt"
"9640660","9640940"," ceiling. "
"9650280","9651120"," All right."
"9655700","9656940"," So there's no delay in the CNBC."
"9657920","9661220"," So this morning when I first got out, I told you I was going to be working in the background. "
"9661460","9662820"," And I told you yesterday I was going to be working in the background."
"9663600","9664200"," So here's my take."
"9664340","9665000"," I'm going to give you my take. "
"9665020","9667320"," I'm going to stay here with you in this live stream staying on."
"9667420","9668280"," This is what I'm going to tell you here."
"9669280","9675840"," In my view, you'll be lucky if we trade down here and close this gap. "
"9677880","9678200"," Okay."
"9678420","9679560"," Now you might be able to close this gap."
"9679560","9683840"," I will buy weekly calls down here for Friday if we do close this gap. "
"9684240","9688640"," My thought here is that you're going to consolidate it here."
"9689520","9694860"," Now I've got some zero dates and I'm going to hold these zero dates until we blast up here for"
"9694860","9696180"," a relief rally of some kind."
"9696540","9700680"," If we can get to wherever these sellers are, these sellers are squeezed higher. "
"9701080","9707600"," I think the closer we get down here, the better our chances are of a squeeze higher."
"9709440","9712100"," In my view, you guys know my views are in the market."
"9712620","9717320"," Anybody that was here yesterday, yesterday's live stream, I don't need to explain myself 16 times. "
"9719880","9720900"," It's like close enough."
"9721120","9723440"," So I'm going to leave live stream on."
"9723560","9725660"," I'm going to come back and live stream at critical points. "
"9726460","9729000"," If we bounce down here, I'll take some some weeklies."
"9729860","9732800"," If we trade and start to squeeze higher, I'll take some profit."
"9733420","9737640"," What I don't want to do is sit here all day long and watch this bullshit for the next. "
"9737860","9738740"," It's 12 o'clock."
"9738880","9740320"," We could do this for two or three more hours."
"9742480","9744700"," So place your trades, stay short if you're short. "
"9745560","9747480"," If you're in the crash camp, you're in the crash camp."
"9748160","9752080"," Myself, I think we trade sideways or get a relief rally up into the close."
"9752360","9758260"," If anything changes materially, if we like break down below this gap, I'll entertain all offers. "
"9760580","9762360"," This to me, I want you to know."
"9762720","9764360"," Any of the tunes in all the time."
"9764540","9766640"," I need this really quick. "
"9767040","9770500"," Anybody that needs any of the tunes in all the time when you start trading sideways like that."
"9771100","9775860"," And you're watching the white line trade sideways and the red line start to turn sideways."
"9776160","9781900"," The white line try to start to turn sideways begins to become more bullish, believe it or not. "
"9782740","9782940"," Okay."
"9783600","9787620"," So that doesn't mean we don't squeeze down for a minute and then go higher, but some capitulation."
"9787620","9791700"," But my view, this market is going to trade sideways or trade higher. "
"9792500","9796540"," Now, the reason why I'm putting you in pause because I'm talking to a friend right now from you"
"9796540","9797140"," guys in the stream."
"9797580","9801900"," And I have two more people that I've talked to today that are part of what we do here."
"9802600","9803940"," I've been meant to do it yesterday. "
"9804360","9808480"," So I'm going to try to do it right now because I don't want to sit here for three hours"
"9808480","9811020"," and watch this happen."
"9811180","9812680"," I'm not watching paint dry."
"9814660","9815920"," So stick with me in the stream. "
"9816520","9817720"," Talk to each other in the chat."
"9818400","9821380"," If you're extremely bearish here like claps bearish hang out."
"9821620","9822180"," I love bears. "
"9822920","9823720"," Don't get me wrong."
"9823900","9825160"," I sell this market all the time."
"9825220","9826200"," I have no problem selling it. "
"9826740","9828240"," So I'm with you if you're a bear."
"9828380","9830100"," If you're like, we're going down to the depths of hell."
"9830760","9832020"," There are other bears here. "
"9832340","9833920"," If you want, you can join us in discord."
"9834140","9834760"," We have a free discord."
"9834760","9836700"," You can join if you just join us for the first time. "
"9838160","9838820"," Let me see."
"9838820","9840740"," Put a link to the discord."
"9843040","9845380"," I'll put a link to the discord so you can join. "
"9848420","9850120"," Get that link in there for you."
"9850680","9851760"," I have some stuff."
"9852140","9853140"," So what happened?"
"9853500","9855640"," I'll kind of give you an idea what happened here. "
"9856120","9858680"," I had done a bunch of work last week."
"9861100","9863900"," And I lost that work into the weekend."
"9864900","9865260"," On. "
"9867420","9868440"," On open office."
"9868700","9870840"," I had to read you all that work over the course of two days."
"9871660","9873220"," And I still haven't sent it off. "
"9873440","9875120"," So I have to send that work off too."
"9875220","9876520"," These are people that work for us."
"9877560","9878400"," In the background. "
"9879520","9882540"," And I have to get this stuff to them so they can continue to work."
"9883740","9885040"," I still haven't sent it."
"9885540","9886760"," I was like, I'm going to do this today. "
"9886760","9887420"," This was yesterday."
"9887540","9888660"," And I'm like, didn't get to do it."
"9888980","9890880"," This looks like sideways to me. "
"9890880","9892900"," So this is an opportunity."
"9893000","9895980"," If we do consolidate here for me to get this work done."
"9897560","9898740"," So hang out. "
"9899040","9899260"," Relax."
"9900080","9902680"," If you do see a break above where these swellers are."
"9904900","9910000"," If you in long calls and you wanted to take profit here, I understand because we could do this"
"9910000","9910700"," bullshit here. "
"9911520","9912480"," And into the close."
"9915420","9918040"," If we do get above, if you want to see bullish."
"9919520","9921320"," I made a comment this morning. "
"9921400","9922700"," I'll be able to pay attention every day."
"9925300","9927920"," Here's where the bull plane is right there."
"9928080","9928180"," Okay. "
"9929320","9930420"," Just so you can see it."
"9931720","9932800"," There's the bull plane."
"9933620","9934880"," And there is price. "
"9935400","9937200"," You need price to follow along."
"9938100","9941580"," We trade higher back test and start to make our way into the close."
"9941880","9942040"," Okay. "
"9942220","9942460"," Right there."
"9942700","9946140"," That's the bull plane performing doesn't mean it's going to form."
"9946140","9947400"," Just letting you know. "
"9948580","9949460"," And I am long."
"9949720","9951500"," I got a bunch of 410 C's."
"9951860","9953900"," If they print, they print if they don't, they don't. "
"9954200","9954940"," I'll be honest with you."
"9954980","9960360"," If we reject up here, I'd be more than happy to buy some weeklies at 405 in the money for"
"9960360","9960620"," Friday."
"9962500","9963340"," So I'll be right back. "
"9963460","9965020"," I'm going to put CNBC on the background."
"9965420","9966400"," Keep it nice and low for you."
"9966640","9967600"," I don't think it's delayed. "
"9968580","9970740"," I went through last week when I took the week off."
"9970880","9976120"," I spent some time going through to get CNBC's kind of real time."
"9976120","9977100"," From the chair. "
"9977400","9979820"," If you don't get the pause tomorrow, does that change your market bias?"
"9980220","9984720"," It's a lead us on for you to listen to and discuss whatever the fuck CNBC is saying."
"9984840","9986140"," I can't stand seeing the scene."
"9986600","9987520"," It's on for you. "
"9987580","9987700"," Okay."
"9987700","9988540"," Who cares what I think?"
"9988720","9988880"," Okay."
"9989020","9989680"," Now I'll still be here. "
"9989760","9991720"," I'll leave the video on you can see me in the background market."
"9992040","9996360"," If they come out, they ignore the inference towards a pause."
"9996360","10000580"," If they come out extremely hawkish, then your market bias will change. "
"10000800","10001220"," It has to."
"10001340","10001840"," Well, let me tell you this."
"10001840","10006140"," At 65% of people who responded to the survey, I just mentioned say equity levels are too high"
"10006140","10008920"," relative to their outlook for earnings and the economy. "
"10009400","10015380"," 47% say there's a chance of a 10% decline in stocks over the next six months."
"10015700","10018120"," So how do we would you guys follow?"
"10018280","10018960"," You fall in that camp?"
"10019340","10020220"," You fall in that camp?"
"10020960","10022320"," Listen, I've said this."
"10022460","10026500"," I think the most intense contraction is right here. "
"10026660","10027260"," It's right now."
"10027700","10029640"," I think when you're looking at all the economic data."
"10029640","10030400"," The contraction of what?"
"10030600","10032700"," I mean, we're about 4,210 seconds ago. "
"10032920","10033860"," I'm not talking about the market."
"10034080","10036100"," I'm talking about what's going on in the real economy."
"10036100","10037900"," I'm talking about the impact on earnings. "
"10038440","10039860"," I'm talking about credit availability."
"10040480","10045560"," I don't think anything matters after the second week of March because that's when you saw the"
"10045560","10047640"," dramatic tightening in credit conditions."
"10048040","10049900"," And we don't know the full effect of that yet. "
"10050160","10053560"," We are now playing through that month of April into May."
"10053820","10056460"," Credit conditions are going to get even tighter."
"10056460","10060620"," And that is going to restrict economic growth. "
"10061040","10063300"," And I think we're going to really feel it in Q3."
"10063400","10065160"," And your earnings were actually better than expected."
"10066060","10069200"," And even guidance was a little bit better than expected. "
"10069480","10072580"," I know we reset the numbers and we reset expectations."
"10073440","10074740"," But the numbers are the numbers."
"10075420","10076820"," The market doesn't believe it. "
"10076940","10077920"," You're absolutely right."
"10078060","10079720"," Earnings are coming in this quarter so fabulously."
"10080000","10082060"," Up 3.2% from a month ago in the estimates. "
"10082680","10084660"," But the full year estimates are still going down."
"10084660","10086360"," And it's the market's way of saying we don't believe it."
"10086540","10087180"," Not every sector. "
"10087460","10088200"," They're not going down."
"10088280","10089560"," They're not going down in every sector."
"10089760","10090020"," No, no, no. "
"10090080","10090460"," But overall."
"10091480","10093200"," They actually went the opposite way."
"10093280","10096500"," The way this narrative changes is when the Fed's done raising rates. "
"10096840","10099940"," Until then, every quarter will continue to be strong labor market."
"10100120","10100720"," GDP is growing."
"10100960","10101520"," Earnings are okay. "
"10102020","10103780"," We don't believe it's going to last until the Fed starts."
"10103800","10105960"," And you're a long-term investor and you see that as an opportunity."
"10105980","10106680"," So do I."
"10106800","10107520"," So does Joe, right?"
"10107780","10109640"," Like that's where you see and you do your homework. "
"10109740","10111220"," And we'll have to be a little bit patient."
"10111220","10113180"," You may not make money right away in names."
"10113180","10115360"," But you look for big quality companies. "
"10115360","10117740"," I don't care if you're a longer-term investor or not."
"10117900","10123720"," If you think the market, if you agree with the group that I mentioned, that if you're in the 47 "
"10123720","10130580","% that think there's a 10% decline coming in stocks, you could be a longer-term investor from here"
"10130580","10131620"," to eternity."
"10132000","10135340"," You're not going to want to buy stocks today if you're convinced they're going to go 10% lower. "
"10135620","10137040"," Like you're not going to buy anything at the store."
"10137180","10140900"," If you know that a week from now, it's going to be 40% off."
"10141080","10141640"," I'm not in that camp. "
"10141640","10143740"," I'm in the trading range camp."
"10144020","10144840"," And I'm looking for opportunity."
"10145100","10146480"," And I'm going to talk about a name that I bought. "
"10146680","10146860"," I know."
"10147000","10148720"," And that's exactly what I'm doing."
"10148980","10149560"," Don't do that yet. "
"10149700","10150060"," No, I know."
"10150260","10151160"," Brian Belsky is here."
"10151300","10151520"," I mentioned. "
"10153440","10155080"," So here's my issue with you."
"10155200","10155320"," Okay."
"10156120","10156300"," Welcome back. "
"10156540","10157600"," Thank you so much."
"10157640","10159680"," Oh, no, this is legit, I think."
"10159980","10160160"," Okay. "
"10160360","10166640"," So the last time that we were on together, you took a shot at me, suggesting that I was too"
"10166640","10168700"," negative on the earnings picture."
"10169120","10169360"," Okay."
"10169740","10170240"," You remember that?"
"10170240","10170980"," I do. "
"10171120","10171280"," I do."
"10171700","10173240"," So, I don't know."
"10173300","10177400"," It was like a day or two later, you put out a note that said, quote, for the first time"
"10177400","10182820"," in many years, our enthusiasm for stock market performance potential this year is relatively"
"10182820","10183300"," tempered. "
"10184240","10191740"," So, I mean, you sound like you're much more sanguine on the market than you would have people"
"10191740","10192560"," otherwise believe."
"10192940","10196640"," I mean, you have a 4,300 price target on the S&P."
"10197380","10202040"," You don't see a significant amount of upside ahead at all. "
"10202680","10203680"," So where's the rub?"
"10204100","10204680"," Where's the rub?"
"10205420","10210440"," You can't be overly optimistic on earnings and then put out commentary that says that."
"10210920","10212840"," First of all, thank you for clarifying."
"10213480","10215080"," There's an opportunity to talk about this. "
"10215180","10216920"," So there's a difference between earnings and performance."
"10223400","10223900"," Sorry."
"10224400","10227580"," I thought I heard my name November of last year. "
"10227740","10228360"," That's our target."
"10228580","10229400"," That's our base case."
"10229400","10231620"," Our bulk case is 4,800 and 230. "
"10232240","10240680"," So, according to our work, the bottoms up number bottomed up for the market two weeks ago around"
"10240680","10242180"," 221 in terms of forecast."
"10242600","10244920"," As Jim said, the loss for this quarter."
"10251320","10253920"," The share it with a friend deal. "
"10254320","10256760"," Even if that friend is yourself."
"10257760","10258880"," You're McDonald's."

"10384460","10385580"," I'm always yelling at her."
"10385800","10386540"," I'm always abusing her."

"10442020","10442940"," for the next three to five years."
"10443080","10445940"," I believe cyclicals, value, small cap. "
"10446440","10451380"," We have been, in small cap stocks, has been unbelievably too negative."
"10451600","10457600"," We're gonna have this massive move into small cap, massive move into value, garb, yield at a"
"10457600","10459120"," reasonable price, quality."
"10459760","10461700"," Those are gonna be leading for the next 10 years. "
"10461700","10466620"," What's happened so far this year is then a complete wishwash of strategy."
"10467620","10471060"," January was by the tech stocks that were beaten up the most."
"10471300","10471820"," Yay, great. "
"10472140","10474660"," We actually were on the network saying we didn't believe in the January move."
"10475060","10476920"," Then January, February we had this value move."
"10477260","10483560"," Then what happened in March was the debacle in financials, which caused people, investors, that"
"10483560","10485100"," needed to be invested, Scott. "
"10485500","10489080"," When you need to be invested, you bought the highest market cap stocks, liquidity stocks."
"10489080","10490120"," What are they?"
"10490300","10490880"," Apple and Microsoft."
"10491620","10493140"," That's why tech went up in March. "
"10493440","10495120"," The same things happened so far."
"10495420","10499620"," Maybe you went to them because they've got the best balance sheets, they've got the best, most"
"10499620","10500360"," stable growth."
"10501040","10504600"," They're viewed as more defensive in nature. "
"10505040","10505340"," They do."
"10505620","10511020"," We've been the cherry pick whatever reason you want to find why people went to those stocks to fit"
"10511020","10511520"," your case."
"10511760","10513480"," We've been defending those stocks for years. "
"10513780","10515320"," We've called them the consumer staples of tech."
"10515920","10517520"," We've maintained our positions there."
"10517520","10521440"," What we have not been in are the high multiple arc stocks. "
"10521640","10524420"," We've been very negative on those stocks and we think they're dead for five years."
"10524960","10530240"," We think technology as the leading sector is going to have a harder time, but that doesn't mean you"
"10530240","10532420"," can still not be market weight."
"10532560","10533680"," It's 26% of the market. "
"10533840","10534560"," That's still a big push."
"10534980","10536280"," Would you sell mega caps now?"
"10536500","10536940"," Take some profits?"
"10537420","10538240"," No, I would not."
"10538760","10543460"," I would trim back if you're overweight because if these stocks have run, if your positions are"
"10543460","10546040"," above where the market is, I would be trimming them back to market weights. "
"10546040","10550740"," I think earnings are what we're talking about."
"10551180","10552480"," I want to give you a reason."
"10552620","10557260"," I want to rationalize why guys like me and Brian think that the bottom is in as of October. "
"10557960","10560740"," It really comes down to where earnings are trending right now."
"10561360","10566660"," Where next year's earnings are trending, around $2.45 to $2.46, is where this year's earnings"
"10566660","10569400"," expectations were roughly a year ago."
"10570060","10575620"," That's a big move that we pushed out the level of earnings around $2.46. We pushed it out a"
"10575620","10575820"," year. "
"10576300","10578400"," That was reflected in our opinion."
"10578620","10580080"," I'll speak for myself probably for Brian."
"10580240","10582280"," I think I can speak for Stephanie too, but I don't want to. "
"10582580","10584900"," That was reflected in the 25% decline."
"10585120","10586340"," I don't want to speak for everybody here."
"10586440","10587640"," Name everybody while you're at it. "
"10587740","10589900"," I'm not going to speak for you, my friend."
"10590320","10590520"," No."
"10590900","10593140"," The 25% peak to trough. "
"10593780","10597080"," Bill's with me even though he's a devil's man."
"10597480","10598300"," I'm speaking for Bill."
"10598440","10598580"," Go ahead. "
"10598760","10606340"," The 25% peak to trough decline last year was the reflection of $245 a share in S&P 500"
"10606340","10608240"," earnings being pushed out a year."
"10608620","10609740"," That's my opinion."
"10610460","10611720"," I'll leave it there. "
"10613240","10617440"," So Brian talked about the factor of momentum indicating something."
"10617600","10624220"," I think what it's indicating is that the market is experiencing a return to where growth is going"
"10624220","10624640"," to be favored."
"10624980","10629940"," Growth at a reasonable price is going to be favored in which inflation is coming down in which"
"10629940","10638140"," unfortunately the overweight exposure to energy, materials, consumer staples needs to be paired"
"10638140","10640860"," back, and it's going to be paired back significantly in the next month. "
"10641500","10644120"," Further momentum strategies are going to be sellers of health care."
"10644520","10645520"," They're going to be sellers of energy."
"10645900","10646660"," You see that today. "
"10647300","10649720"," And the mega caps, however you wanted to find them."
"10649760","10653200"," And by the way, a fantastic job with meta holding on to that position."
"10653920","10655540"," I'm now joining you in that position. "
"10655540","10661800"," But I think the mega caps, however you wanted to find them, they are indicative of the environment"
"10661800","10662900"," we are in."
"10663020","10664300"," No, I don't disagree with that."
"10664480","10667920"," But the one thing is you have to remember too that so many energy stocks got thrown into the growth"
"10667920","10668220"," index. "
"10668380","10669300"," So you've got to be careful on that."
"10669600","10674380"," Number one, number two staples are excessively expensive and who's buying Campbell soup and general"
"10674380","10674820"," meals anymore."
"10675140","10679600"," Number three, I think you can still, I think that what you want to be in, it's not binary. "
"10680040","10681120"," Not all value are growth."
"10681460","10681900"," It's value."
"10682240","10683540"," Growth at a reasonable price. "
"10683540","10684520"," And quality."
"10684880","10690920"," If you take a quality umbrella over the market and you do a filter, you know, the highest quality"
"10690920","10693300"," stocks are tech because of the balance sheet."
"10693480","10693800"," Of course they are. "
"10693820","10694280"," In the earnings stability."
"10694600","10695180"," That's why they're rallying."
"10695400","10698420"," So that's why this quality is actually significantly outperforming. "
"10698420","10698540"," Correct."
"10699080","10703800"," But on your comment on energy, just expand that if I don't understand when you."
"10703840","10708980"," So because, remember, when they reconstitute the index, a lot of the reconstitution index is based"
"10708980","10709440"," on performance. "
"10709500","10712540"," So energy has been a great performer in 21 and 22."
"10712540","10715300"," So therefore you have a lot of energy stocks in the growth index."
"10715620","10716960"," And I think that could be a problem. "
"10717340","10722320"," Number one, number two, I think that we've entered into this period, like the 80s and 90s, mid 80s,"
"10722360","10724880"," mid 90s, where it's going to be a stock pickers market."
"10725100","10729080"," Jim and I are talking, we talk more than, you know, off air."
"10729680","10732620"," But it's really difficult. "
"10733000","10734220"," It's really difficult."
"10734700","10737120"," It's definitely can talk about this joke too."
"10737380","10742040"," It's really difficult to beat the market when it's up a lot or down a lot. "
"10742040","10743180"," It's really difficult."
"10743540","10747100"," But I think we're entering into a period, as we've been talking about now, for several months, this"
"10747100","10752680"," notion of normalizing historical returns, high single digit, low double digit."
"10753060","10758040"," We can beat the market in those types of returns because we're on concentrated portfolios, 50"
"10758040","10760180"," stocks, 75 at the most in small mid cap. "
"10760640","10763320"," And if we're in the right stocks in the right positions, you can beat the market."
"10763500","10768320"," I think too many people are still focused on making the big market call versus making stock calls."
"10768320","10772300"," So your value call, though, that would imply that you think rates are going to stay higher for"
"10772300","10772540"," longer. "
"10773040","10774000"," Is that in fact the case?"
"10774140","10776160"," Stephanie, anything is higher than zero."
"10776500","10778320"," Anything is higher than zero rates, right?"
"10778800","10782960"," And if you look at the historical interest rate with respect to the ten year, including the"
"10782960","10784820"," financial crisis, it's 5%, right?"
"10785240","10786420"," If you take that out, it's 7%."
"10786920","10788840"," So we're going to be lower than that, right?"
"10788980","10792480"," But we're going to be, the majority of investors that I speak with, unfortunately, on the south"
"10792480","10793600"," side, have been the business ten years. "
"10793880","10796600"," All I know is that you buy stocks as interest rates go down."
"10796600","10802600"," But if we're in a 2% to 3%, or 3% to 4%, ten year treasury range, that's really"
"10802600","10806440"," good for stock picking, and it's really good for value, but it's also good for growth at a"
"10806440","10806920"," reasonable price."
"10807420","10809600"," And so I think that's the kind of environment we're heading into. "
"10810160","10811340"," Let me ask you before we go."
"10811700","10815800"," There was a time where you advocated for buying the financials."
"10816420","10824800"," Do you, like others, not all, but others, worry that there's another shoot-a-drop in all this that"
"10824800","10827100"," we've been witnessing, especially on the regional side?"
"10827740","10828580"," It's a wonderful question. "
"10829860","10836960"," We only own three small cap banks, and we've done a lot of work in terms of their balance sheets,"
"10837140","10839500"," strength, and cash flow, and more importantly, management."
"10839860","10841260"," Are you allowed to say what they are?"
"10841720","10845020"," Yeah, Glacier Bank, for citizens in East West Bank or?"
"10846400","10849500"," Exquisitely clean balance sheets, great management teams, and great cash flow."
"10849500","10855080"," Now, we have been very clear that our overall theme for financials is money center banks, Canadian"
"10855080","10857660"," banks, asset managers, and broker dealers. "
"10857940","10858040"," Why?"
"10858340","10865660"," All four of those industries are scalable, and I believe when we set on air on April 5th, it's"
"10865660","10866200"," already happened."
"10866440","10867900"," Big banks are taken share from small banks."
"10868140","10870180"," The exact end versus what happened in 2008, 2009. "
"10870700","10872180"," I believe you're going to see massive consolidation."
"10872780","10875080"," There's 4,000 banks in the United States."
"10875600","10878860"," I think five years from now, there's 2,500 because of the consolidation. "
"10878860","10880900"," There's 600 publicly traded banks."
"10881180","10885260"," I bet there's 300 because we're going to see consolidation in the small mid-cap land."
"10885600","10886220"," Who wins in that?"
"10886620","10887280"," The big guys. "
"10887540","10887660"," Why?"
"10887940","10891840"," Because of balance sheet strength, price-attangible book has never been stronger, and they do have"
"10891840","10895960"," the credit in balance sheet available to be able to facilitate even through a storm."
"10896700","10898200"," Are the Leafs going to win the cup too?"
"10900400","10901680"," I'm more worried about the twins."
"10902520","10906560"," They beat the Yankees for the first time in a season series in 20 years, so maybe they'll finally"
"10906560","10907960"," get to the playoffs and beat the Yankees. "
"10907960","10910240"," The Leafs will only go with the Canadians."
"10910560","10912920"," The Bank of Montreal, you don't even acknowledge the Leafs?"
"10913340","10915640"," Sure, but I don't want to jinx them."
"10915800","10920200"," If you're a true Toronto fan or a true Minnesota sports fan, you never want to support them"
"10920200","10920460"," publicly. "
"10920740","10921500"," You can actually go the other way."
"10922900","10923900"," It's good having you back."

"11093060","11111900"," We have a"
"11111900","11116440"," bombshell today from short seller Hindenburg Research, which is revealing a new short position"
"11116440","11118900"," against Carl Icahn's IEP."
"11119640","11125660"," The Hindenburg report says IEP has significantly inflated the value of its assets, that it trades"
"11125660","11128640"," at an unreasonable premium to its holding company peers. "
"11129220","11134240"," Hindenburg saying IEP trades at a more than 200% premium to its reported net asset value, and"
"11134240","11138980"," compared to Dan Loeb's third point and Bill Ackman's person Square, for example, which they contend"
"11138980","11140120"," each traded a discount."
"11140660","11148580"," Hindenburg contends IEP's NAV is inflated by at least 22% due to overly aggressive marks in"
"11148580","11150860"," underperformance, which it contends is continuing."
"11150860","11154260"," They take aim at three IEP units specifically. "
"11154740","11157140"," Real estate, meat packaging, and automotive parts."
"11157860","11165840"," Hindenburg also goes after IEP's dividend yield of 15.8%, saying it, quote, equates to an absurd 50 "
"11165840","11169880",".5% of last reported indicative value net asset value."
"11170040","11175040"," They allege the dividend is unsupported by IEP's cash flow and investment performance, which they"
"11175040","11176780"," say has been negative for years. "
"11177340","11182300"," Hindenburg also says IEP has suffered additional performance losses since this last disclosure."
"11183000","11189480"," They say they expect ICON to cut or eliminate the dividend entirely, barring what it calls a"

"11953220","11958640"," So even if we go up on my point here is that the best you'll expect is probably for 1230."
"11960720","11961980"," Even if we go up here. "
"11962580","11963680"," Watch my cursor over here."
"11964020","11965580"," You'll see a failure at some point."
"11966640","11967120"," Right. "
"11968000","11971100"," And all those call holders won't print their calls."
"11971860","11971880"," Okay."
"11972200","11974080"," Sounds like the best outcome for a bull here. "
"11975480","11978720"," So just in zero days at some point take the money and run."
"11978720","11979280"," Either here."
"11979900","11980280"," Here. "
"11981040","11981500"," Here."
"11981700","11981880"," Okay."
"11982100","11985020"," Normally not always like nine out of ten times. "
"11985920","11989920"," With that said, there's still this gap that hasn't been filled down below."
"11990360","11993060"," I'm not anti going down here for this gap today either."
"11995840","11997800"," So just temper your expectations. "
"11998200","11999080"," Sometimes we do."
"12000980","12003240"," We could also just ping pong around in here."
"12003340","12005140"," So if you're like taking your money and running here. "
"12006100","12006780"," Repositioning yourself."
"12007040","12007760"," If you're a bull."
"12010420","12013020"," Or just temper your expectations at my point. "
"12013280","12014260"," Now this S3 though."
"12014780","12020900"," Is kind of this is you know not not a bad I think to be outside of our implied move"
"12020900","12021400"," for today."
"12021980","12026300"," And stay and not even come back to retest S3 is kind of a big deal. "
"12027760","12031020"," Even if it's a failure to retest S3 is kind of like a head scratcher."
"12031720","12031920"," Unusual."
"12033020","12034140"," So can we get up there?"
"12034140","12034520"," Sure. "
"12039220","12040800"," I'm long zero dates here."
"12040980","12043400"," Now if any point this fails and comes back down."
"12044280","12046860"," To fill this gap today by the end of the fucking day. "
"12047580","12050000"," I'm I'm looking for a gap for a debt."
"12050140","12051040"," If you're a bull out there."
"12051700","12055620"," You should consider this a gift like between where we are right now. "
"12057640","12059100"," For like some calls."
"12060320","12066260"," Where we are down here for some calls or any kind of weakness off of the."
"12067660","12069480"," FMC rate decision tomorrow. "
"12069480","12072120"," This is a three prime prime."
"12073040","12075840"," Opportunities for weeklies monthlies."
"12076480","12080600"," The fact that we're you're getting this gift the day before the FMC rate decision. "
"12080600","12082260"," You're going to have a dip to buy."
"12082420","12085100"," I assure you either either right here."
"12085960","12092620"," Right here where my cursor is or any kind of weakness off of that rate decision. "
"12093040","12097140"," So that's what I'm going to tell you like three ninety six."
"12097300","12099940"," If they even gave the gift of three ninety six."
"12100620","12102080"," It's like full port calls. "
"12102560","12105280"," So if you're if you're a bull out here."
"12106560","12108460"," This is not a bad place."
"12108460","12111140"," I don't mean and zero dates specifically. "
"12111640","12116060"," But like I don't even know if it's a weeklies but like between the now and tomorrow."
"12117220","12120400"," Buying a monthly down here like three ninety six monthlies."
"12120400","12121220"," I'll take it. "
"12122040","12123840"," So just just be aware of that."
"12124260","12129780"," Otherwise you're positing that the market is going to trade to three eighty."
"12129980","12133480"," Basically you're saying it's going to go to three eighty seven three seventy eight. "
"12133480","12135820"," Not three eighty seven like three seventy eight."
"12137240","12138260"," Somewhere down there."
"12138640","12139420"," So unless you're on that. "
"12139600","12142600"," If you're on that like hey we're going to three seventy eight three eighty."
"12142940","12148100"," I need us to trade below three ninety six to even discuss three eighty."
"12148380","12150140"," That's another hundred and sixty points lower. "
"12150640","12156740"," So I've got us going down right now from four oh nine to three ninety six."
"12157580","12159020"," So like that's a hundred."
"12160480","12162460"," And forty points lower. "
"12163740","12167460"," And then there's another hundred and fucking whatever below that."
"12168200","12169700"," So for me personally."
"12171080","12175560"," You're either getting a dip buy for like two week or monthly calls here. "
"12175660","12178220"," You're getting them down here or you're going to be getting them."
"12178940","12181280"," Tomorrow and any kind of weakness tomorrow."
"12181900","12183360"," And I will warn you of something. "
"12184060","12187460"," If they unclench this this fix this volatility right."
"12188160","12191020"," You go into the meeting tomorrow right."
"12191020","12195040"," The moment that meeting moment the whatever the number is that comes out tomorrow. "
"12195380","12197260"," That volatility is gone."
"12197780","12200240"," Makes sense that volatility comes off the market."
"12200960","12205880"," And if we're at like fucking four hundred or three ninety six or four oh five or something. "
"12206620","12208940"," This market's going to rip faces off higher."
"12209780","12212940"," Just from the ball being unclenched."
"12213240","12215140"," Just keep that in mind the next two days. "
"12215900","12299520"," So yesterday just"
"12299520","12301860"," the spy forget SPX and ES right."
"12302620","12305540"," So just yesterday we were at four seventeen."
"12307180","12307260"," Right. "
"12307700","12310560"," Think about this like red down a piece of paper like four seventeen."
"12311000","12312280"," We're at four twenty on a yes."
"12313220","12316780"," And I'm like yeah I would love to buy three ninety six right. "
"12317060","12317760"," So that's like."
"12318480","12321360"," Two hundred and what forty points lower."
"12321360","12326320"," If you think we're going lower than two hundred forty points on the S&P five hundred on. "
"12327200","12329080"," Twenty five BPS rate hike."
"12329740","12331640"," There's got to be something we don't know."
"12332240","12338560"," If you're positing that like hey the S&P five hundred is going to fall three four five hundred"
"12338560","12338840"," points. "
"12339620","12344760"," Twenty five basis point rate hike something's like there's something we don't know."
"12345240","12346160"," If that's the case."
"12346980","12347380"," All right. "
"12349080","12351420"," You guys got him saying so you got to like."
"12352260","12353380"," Not anti that."
"12355960","12357800"," I'm not anti S going down. "
"12358360","12363580"," You know from yesterday's high from four twenty on."
"12364220","12369220"," On a yes saying hey we're going to go from four twenty down to three ninety six right."
"12369860","12372020"," So what is that two hundred forty points right. "
"12372020","12374780"," So if you're going to positive times a bear you're like okay I'm a bear or you're."
"12374900","12379540"," It's just air bowling like we're going to get on two hundred forty points on a twenty five basis"
"12379540","12380240"," point."
"12380660","12383040"," I'm like okay that sounds legit. "
"12383040","12384300"," I can get on board with that."
"12386620","12389440"," I can positive that I'm like yeah I can digest that."
"12390240","12395280"," If you're going to tell now this is the normal the normal motions of where we are in the market"
"12395280","12395520"," right. "
"12395900","12397400"," So like we're at the top at four twenty."
"12398140","12399640"," We're going to definitely come down."
"12399820","12401620"," Market doesn't go straight up to go straight down. "
"12401940","12402740"," It's zig zags."
"12402840","12403520"," We all know that right."
"12404720","12406120"," So on the zig zag down. "
"12406840","12409540"," You're like okay we're going to get down two hundred forty points of like that's."
"12410060","12412520"," That's a little long of a tooth but it's it's possible."
"12413700","12415820"," This is on everything that we know is going to happen tomorrow. "
"12417360","12418840"," So like twenty five BPS."
"12420300","12421080"," Just the pause."
"12422400","12424220"," Not rate cut not fifty BPS. "
"12426040","12428580"," And you wanted to say well it's not just that cap."
"12429060","12430300"," We ran all the way up."
"12430860","12431880"," We're at the top of the rotation. "
"12432100","12433140"," We've rotated already once."
"12434320","12435620"," We're going to take two hundred forty points."
"12435720","12436460"," I'm like yeah I get all that. "
"12436680","12438700"," But then there's some people out there that are right now saying."
"12439500","12442600"," We can go down like three hundred four hundred five hundred points."
"12443300","12443940"," I'm like me. "
"12447100","12451520"," We're talking about the break in three ninety six right now and going to three eighty three seventy"
"12451520","12451940"," eight."
"12452780","12454600"," It has to be something we don't know."
"12455080","12455580"," That's possible. "
"12458460","12461560"," But that information hasn't shown itself yet."
"12462640","12463820"," Could we go down to three eighty."
"12465220","12467180"," This month possible. "
"12467620","12467720"," Yeah."
"12468300","12470020"," Right now price wise possible."
"12470820","12473500"," At some point this month like in the month of May. "
"12477520","12478420"," Not probable."
"12482670","12484750"," I'd give you three eighty for the debt ceiling."
"12485310","12489170"," Like June 1st or even if it was front run into like maybe the last week of May. "
"12489910","12493950"," But let's try to think about think about my point to you if you're a bear is."
"12494450","12496850"," Like remember if you're a bull or a bear it doesn't matter."
"12497490","12499150"," If we're going up we zig zag up right. "
"12499850","12500690"," If we're going down."
"12501310","12502510"," We zig zag down."
"12503130","12504770"," The only time we don't zig zag down. "
"12506310","12507530"," You know like we're going down."
"12508630","12509530"," Something like that."
"12509530","12512170"," The only time we don't do this zig zag down. "
"12512410","12514110"," That there's a relief rally right there."
"12514330","12515530"," There's your other relief rally."
"12515890","12519510"," The only time we don't do that and just start fucking like sending it like boom. "
"12520250","12520610"," Boom."
"12521150","12522410"," Gap downs overnight."
"12522730","12523510"," That kind of stuff. "
"12524070","12526390"," That's when we're in negative gamma."
"12528790","12534490"," With high volatility like above thirty trading thirty forty on the VIX."
"12535870","12537630"," We're in a bear. "
"12537770","12539410"," Or not just a bear market but in a."
"12540490","12545230"," Like a bear or I'm just saying like saying bear but."
"12545750","12547890"," Like it's negative gamma it's."
"12549970","12553910"," Markets positioned like we've got tons of fucking puts down there. "
"12554330","12559070"," Then we get cascade waterfall puts and you've got institutions selling into each other."
"12559070","12561790"," So you need like material reasons for that to happen."
"12564490","12565870"," You need high volatility. "
"12567830","12573710"," We're not in any of those things that just the just the just the picture that I posted on the"
"12573710","12574230"," stream today."
"12574510","12577590"," Just look at that picture if you were tuned in yesterday."
"12578110","12584050"," I showed you the trend that we were in the overall larger trend that we were in. "
"12585790","12589870"," And even even on rotation we're not bearish."
"12590610","12593690"," We're like sixty percent fifty percent right now."
"12593690","12594950"," Maybe even higher. "
"12594970","12596950"," I haven't looked today but yesterday was quite high."
"12597830","12602230"," If you want to start seeing the legs down we need to be at like below forty and then below"
"12602230","12603010"," twenty one."
"12604070","12605610"," That's when you get a liquidation event. "
"12606810","12608590"," So when you rotate in and out of sectors."
"12610810","12613830"," And we're rotating right in and out in and out in and out in and out."
"12613970","12615570"," That's what we did this past Thursday and Friday. "
"12615890","12616830"," We rotated back in."
"12618170","12618610"," To."
"12620590","12621590"," Tekken stuff right. "
"12623970","12628690"," And when we did that there was another market rotation price wasn't falling breath."
"12629790","12630230"," And so."
"12631410","12633050"," We're in a low volatility environment. "
"12633050","12633990"," That's what happens."
"12635730","12637650"," We're not in a high volatility environment."
"12637910","12638630"," Vix tells you that. "
"12639150","12639590"," So."
"12640410","12642890"," We just traded the fuck down to what on the Vix."
"12642910","12646850"," We just traded down to fifteen dollars and fifteen cents. "
"12647530","12651370"," Like a hundred points in the Vix is or ten points in the Vix."
"12652150","12653510"," Is a big move."
"12653890","12657350"," It's a huge move to get to twenty five in the Vix right now. "
"12658210","12659970"," So just be conscious of that."
"12660130","12661370"," Like keep that on your radar."
"12662310","12664030"," Whether you're a bull or a bear it doesn't matter. "
"12664210","12664370"," Just like."
"12665770","12666990"," I want you to like."
"12667930","12669070"," Be making money. "
"12669410","12669890"," Not just."
"12670670","12671410"," Oh yeah, baby."
"12671590","12673510"," Sixty seven cents on those four times right now. "
"12674170","12674650"," So."
"12675970","12680390"," Just keep that idea right in the back of your mind or keep your expectations."
"12681690","12682170"," Rational. "
"12683710","12685190"," You don't need to call every."
"12685930","12689270"," You need to call every upper down or the top like this."
"12689510","12691710"," Like there's always someone that's like that was the top. "
"12692090","12694450"," I called it but they've been calling it for the past month."
"12695230","12697250"," Right past three months past six months."
"12698150","12699910"," Actually since last May or so. "
"12700270","12701230"," Twenty twenty two."
"12701990","12703190"," That's the bottom that's the top."
"12703790","12704950"," It just hasn't. "
"12705150","12706430"," I was just talking to a friend about this."
"12707470","12709630"," And if you're a bear or a sell side."
"12710090","12710750"," You take profit. "
"12711210","12711870"," You're going to move like this."
"12711990","12712410"," Take profit."
"12713390","12713970"," You let the market. "
"12714950","12717110"," Breathe a minute before you take short again."
"12719330","12723210"," Even yesterday when we hit that we had that we hit that new high on spy yesterday."
"12723490","12725290"," When Marinky was calling out the new highs yesterday. "
"12726650","12729070"," And you know you start to say hey it's a little toppy."
"12729070","12729970"," Right."
"12730150","12731150"," We need to come down a little bit. "
"12732090","12737570"," We know that even if we went up today that it would get sold at one between one three o "
"12737570","12739410","'clock into the Fed rate decision."
"12743220","12744620"," Just like temperature."
"12748560","12750080"," Expectations trade each level. "
"12751020","12754300"," You don't start discussing that we're going to three seventy eight."
"12755360","12759920"," Until you break every level like you take it level to level."
"12760560","12761940"," You break through the next level. "
"12762660","12765940"," Then you start to entertain the conversation that we're going lower right."
"12766440","12770900"," If you like break that if you break break this daily trigger like watch this daily trigger right"
"12770900","12771100"," here."
"12771900","12778220"," If price begins to break below and then reject right proving to you right breaks below. "
"12779500","12779600"," Right."
"12779940","12781720"," This support turns into resistance."
"12783640","12783680"," Right. "
"12783980","12787800"," And then you can begin to discuss hey we're going to four hundred or going to three ninety six."
"12788420","12790300"," Then down there you take the money and run."
"12790980","12793780"," And then if it breaks if let's pretend this was three ninety six. "
"12794560","12799080"," You'd have to see a definitive breakthrough and then even just a confirmation that we're going"
"12799080","12801040"," lower for each level."
"12801600","12805320"," And this mostly has to do with bears because we're in a positive game environment."
"12806180","12809020"," And we're not we're in a trend higher. "
"12809740","12811940"," On the zigzag channels you guys see it right."
"12813280","12817160"," Show to yesterday so specifically to bears you have to be like tactful."
"12818880","12822800"," Take your money and run wait for the confirmation that we're going lower. "
"12823880","12824840"," That's an important thing."
"12826500","12828140"," You don't want to see consolidates."
"12828200","12829080"," My fact I'll show it to you. "
"12838580","12839480"," Let me show you guys something."
"12843180","12844280"," So I'd spoken a winky."
"12845020","12847040"," I think on Thursday and I was again a trend day. "
"12847600","12853480"," And then I spoke to Joe Donut Friday and I was like we're getting on a fucking trend day."
"12855680","12857200"," And how you could see it was."
"12860020","12862040"," This is the daily right here this yellow line. "
"12864320","12867520"," And what you wanted to see on this was a break."
"12871000","12875580"," If you're a bear what you wanted to see was a break below the daily."
"12877300","12879840"," And then a firm rejection of the daily. "
"12880180","12881220"," And that's your next leg lower."
"12881800","12883400"," You like you take the money and run here."
"12883940","12888580"," You wrap it up and you wait for the price action to show you that we're going lower. "
"12888860","12891040"," Like a hard rejection on that daily right there."
"12891560","12894400"," We didn't get that hard rejection."
"12894800","12896020"," We started fucking around in here. "
"12896220","12897840"," We started seeing this nonsense over here."
"12899200","12900300"," We had one capitulation moment."
"12900660","12906200"," But the time that it took to do this was not convincing. "
"12907680","12910700"," Okay, this is like this is basically dealers."
"12914360","12915240"," Horse trading."
"12915780","12916920"," Simple as way to say it. "
"12919000","12923620"," And this is south side taking the money and running and handing the bags off to a new bear."
"12924020","12925440"," Bears like we're going down."
"12926200","12928580"," And you get the quick reversal and you're completely fucked. "
"12929440","12930820"," So I think pay attention to this stuff."
"12931520","12936920"," If there's a definitive blast through we start like right away start going down on this rejection."
"12937040","12937460"," Right here. "
"12938620","12940120"," That's your answer that we're going lower."
"12941200","12942340"," Now just right here."
"12947250","12949190"," If you're a bear what you want to see is. "
"12950650","12951170"," Here."
"12953010","12955710"," To come back down and immediately start to sell."
"12956670","12957970"," Like today tomorrow. "
"12958910","12960390"," Not fucking five days from now."
"12961090","12962310"," Or five sessions."
"12962590","12963590"," Not fucking ten sessions. "
"12964150","12965170"," None of this horseshit over here."
"12965990","12969790"," You know, and that's where you get your one your three day three three red bar trade, right?"
"12970110","12972430"," It's like three they call three bar trade right three bar bear straight."
"12973010","12974150"," It's just like three days. "
"12975630","12976750"," It's the elevator down."
"12977850","12979210"," So you're looking for this."
"12979670","12980030"," You're a bear. "
"12983170","12983830"," Coming up."
"12985170","12988010"," Your next target below would be 40168."
"12989370","12990090"," Below that. "
"12991690","12992490"," 397 94."
"12993250","12995130"," And that's what that's what I'm talking about."
"12995390","12996510"," That's what I'm expecting. "
"12996870","12997690"," So at worst."
"12998970","12999810"," Something like this."
"13001790","13003490"," And then a dip to get bought in here. "
"13003790","13005630"," I'm watching breath at the same time."
"13006350","13009830"," And I'm watching PPO and PPMs to grab that dip down there."
"13009970","13010650"," So if you're a bull. "
"13011330","13012270"," I mean you're like fuck it."
"13012890","13015730"," If we can get anything like this is a gift to a bull."
"13016170","13018410"," That's a point like four hundred three ninety six. "
"13018950","13021590"," If that were to happen sweet, don't do it."
"13022710","13025170"," You know, I don't want to buy calls tomorrow."
"13025410","13026970"," If we were trading tomorrow up here. "
"13027670","13029870"," I don't want to fucking buy calls right here for 12."
"13030910","13032490"," For 21 to buy them down here."
"13033170","13033750"," Makes sense. "
"13035150","13035990"," For a trip higher."
"13038450","13038850"," Right."
"13039030","13041450"," Yes, they were talking about put spreads in the stream yesterday. "
"13042210","13046130"," And I was like, yeah, I wouldn't be getting like three sixties or three nineties."
"13046230","13048770"," I think I even what was the spread of the put spread that I."
"13049990","13051210"," Called out yesterday was."
"13053290","13054350"," It's on tape, right?"
"13054590","13057770"," I think it was four oh eight or four was it four sixteen. "
"13058310","13060930"," I think it was four seventeen or four twenty down to four hundred."
"13061370","13062210"," Or four oh four."
"13062510","13063890"," And you've got most of it at this point. "
"13064870","13065110"," Right."
"13067970","13070050"," So you get the point I'm trying to make, I guess."
"13070890","13074850"," Is you take your money and run wait for the next and see this hourly rolling over right here?"
"13074930","13075490"," This is bearish. "
"13076770","13078890"," Sorry, they're coming down like this is bearish here."
"13080150","13082850"," I'm not anti this this rolling over up here."
"13083690","13084490"," That's going down. "
"13084770","13087570"," But just be you're looking for certain things."
"13089970","13095730"," You're either looking for price to be below four oh eight or rejection at four twelve up here."
"13100400","13101580"," You're looking for those things. "
"13101760","13102660"," Here's four twelve up here."
"13104200","13107020"," So if price goes up here, you'll be looking for this sell down."
"13108460","13109620"," That's where you'll make some money. "
"13109880","13111300"," You'll take the money and run here."
"13111940","13116020"," Blasts below and you'll wait for the confirmation for the next like lower over here."
"13116240","13116480"," Makes sense. "
"13117040","13119300"," Money here, money here, money here."
"13119680","13120940"," Don't get trapped in this shit in here."
"13121740","13122940"," Cause I'll show you an example. "
"13123200","13124160"," I already showed you the example, right?"
"13124660","13125220"," Just last Thursday."
"13125800","13126400"," What happened here?"
"13127920","13131760"," They burned a bunch of puts into the end of the week and then come Thursday and Friday."
"13132000","13135460"," They fucking blasted it to four fucking twenty, right?"
"13135460","13136900"," Four forty four forty two hundred. "
"13136900","13140220"," So, you know, there'll be bears that are in here going."
"13141820","13143000"," I'm just going to hold."
"13143800","13146980"," I'm sure there were bears last week that were we were down here in this daily. "
"13147640","13148800"," Last Wednesday in close."
"13149180","13150080"," I bet they were like fuck that."
"13150220","13150700"," We're going lower. "
"13151440","13152860"," That's not that we don't go lower."
"13153520","13154740"," Just take the money and run."
"13155260","13157480"," Then gap back in once we break below. "
"13158200","13159920"," And it's definitively going down."
"13161520","13162460"," Level the level."
"13164460","13165640"," That's the point that we're trying to make. "
"13166100","13171780"," So, right now we have a bullish bear, a bull cross happening on the spot."
"13172780","13177200"," We'll see if it gets rejected, if the sellers are able to hold on up here."
"13178100","13183000"," If they are not able to hold on, we are going to begin to squeeze likely to four twelve thirty"
"13183000","13185240"," or a failure of four twelve thirty. "
"13186540","13188280"," This could be a bull trapping to lower."
"13189060","13191380"," I'm not anti that that trade lower either."
"13191600","13195760"," If this trade doesn't work out for me to the upside, I'm just looking for another dip to buy down"
"13195760","13196000"," below. "
"13197880","13200200"," To destroy these sellers at this point."
"13200940","13203420"," Now, for me to take a short here for a put."
"13204460","13205700"," Because I do want to get on this put. "
"13205840","13207820"," I'm looking to buy puts right here."
"13208780","13209540"," Somewhere in here."
"13210980","13212440"," I want to buy some puts in here. "
"13213640","13215520"," For the rate decision tomorrow."
"13215520","13217640"," So, if I get a chance to buy some puts."
"13218160","13220960"," I'll be closing out these calls up here and buying some puts down here. "
"13221000","13221640"," That's my plan."
"13226520","13227500"," If we go up here."
"13227660","13230120"," I don't know if maybe I'm saying two different things. "
"13230520","13232960"," If we go up here, monetize by puts."
"13233860","13234600"," If we go down here."
"13235220","13236300"," Definitely getting some weeklies. "
"13236660","13242840"," I said weeklies by probably two week out or maybe a monthlies out here."
"13243720","13244720"," Is there anything down here?"
"13246320","13247120"," I'm not guaranteed."
"13247120","13250240"," But it's a high probability we're going back up between now and a month. "
"13252180","13252700"," Okay."
"13254400","13258380"," Now trading 65 cents and 4.10. P's."
"13258620","13260360"," 4.12s. I'm looking at two. "
"13261220","13263320"," Those are 12 cents right now."
"13265100","13271400"," So those 12 cents, they're saying the dealers are saying we're not going to get to 4.12. That's"
"13271400","13271940"," what they're saying."
"13274800","13276660"," Dealers are saying we're not getting there. "
"13277640","13278860"," At 12 cents."
"13281440","13283200"," Yeah, they're saying they only pay 11 cents."
"13283400","13284340"," That's a goddamn lie too. "
"13285040","13286840"," So they're saying we're not getting up here."
"13287820","13289400"," At least that's what the dealers are saying."
"13292520","13293900"," It might actually be a good trade. "
"13294840","13296460"," Let's buy some 4.12 C's too."
"13297360","13301500"," So just right now, we are on a bull cross right now."
"13301500","13302940"," We want to see confirmation first. "
"13303740","13305460"," How do you get confirmation on a bull cross?"
"13306040","13307100"," It's not just the cross."
"13307780","13314320"," You're also looking for price to check the one in five minute right here."
"13315920","13318080"," What you'll see is price. "
"13319600","13321260"," Trade higher check."
"13322160","13323040"," And then move higher."
"13323280","13326540"," If you flip this chart upside down, it's the same thing that I was just telling the bears. "
"13328040","13330280"," You get the squeeze higher, come back down."
"13330760","13334500"," This is the money part of the trade for bulls right here."
"13335360","13336240"," If this happens. "
"13338720","13340740"," Okay, so we'll just watch this as it unfolds."
"13347120","13350400"," If you don't know what I'm talking about, come back every day."
"13351180","13352840"," We talk about this every single day. "
"13354140","13356300"," So if you're like, I don't know where we're at."
"13356480","13357420"," I don't know what's going on."
"13357780","13358460"," I don't know what he means. "
"13359660","13362760"," There's two options for you either join us in the discord."
"13363020","13364560"," We have it's a very welcoming discord."
"13365260","13369380"," People will teach you there or keep showing up these live streams every day. "
"13369380","13371880"," And you'll understand within a week."
"13372280","13374680"," Within five sessions, you'll be like, I understand."
"13375560","13377800"," We keep it really fucking simple around here. "
"13378560","13380580"," This is a one minute chart right now, we're trading on."
"13382200","13383580"," So I'll be back with you in just a moment."
"13410750","13412570"," There's some links to the discord. "
"13413330","13415270"," I just posted them in Twitch and on YouTube."
"13417190","13420370"," So if you guys want to click through that link, do they click through?"
"13420550","13420790"," Do they give?"
"13422350","13423590"," Oh, it didn't show."
"13424210","13426270"," That's where it didn't show the discord link. "
"13427890","13428650"," Hold on a second."
"13428710","13429670"," Let me see if I can get you a different link."
"13430290","13430890"," Oh, there it is. "
"13431030","13431970"," One just popped up on Twitch."
"13432210","13432850"," Just took a few minutes."
"13433570","13434630"," And I'll lay it in a few minutes. "
"13434770","13436270"," Like 30 seconds, 45 seconds later."
"13436270","13436790"," I'll kick in."
"13446470","13447510"," Rest rate risk. "
"13447810","13450990"," And at the same time that they've had enormously resilient deposits."
"13451630","13454150"," That's a wonderful combination with higher integration."
"13454150","13454790"," I don't know why. "
"13455030","13455070"," Why?"
"13457190","13460630"," I think it's very different because it's not systemic."
"13460990","13464250"," It's really a flow of flight to quality."
"13464850","13468510"," And the fact that the big banks are going down so much, I think it's creating that opportunity. "
"13469130","13469230"," Right."
"13469350","13470170"," So you'd be a buyer here."
"13470210","13474970"," I mean, some who said it's Wells Fargo sort of ironically benefiting from the asset cap that maybe"
"13474970","13475390"," they didn't. "
"13475830","13480590"," Or you're doing a pandemic and go out on a limb in the same way that other institutions."
"13480590","13482230"," Well, there's getting a little right now."
"13482270","13483650"," Southside getting run over trade. "
"13483770","13484950"," Four nine ninety three."
"13484970","13485670"," It's just a flight to quality."
"13485770","13488210"," Four tensies trading at seventy two cents. "
"13488210","13491270"," And when we see sort of scary headlines like this right now."
"13491270","13491970"," 13 cents."
"13492270","13495070"," You know, the US banking system is insolvent basically. "
"13495790","13497590"," What would your response be to that?"
"13498070","13503910"," Well, it's it's it's it's a stupid comment because of course they're only marking one side of the"
"13503910","13504870"," balance sheet to market."
"13505210","13505450"," Right."
"13505950","13507850"," Insolvency is when your liabilities. "
"13507850","13508850"," Right."
"13508850","13509010"," Right."
"13510010","13511630"," In your life. "
"13511830","13512330"," It was equity."
"13512870","13516930"," It was like, you know, like caps get the hand on the rudder today."
"13517010","13521990"," We're very focused on marking the assets to market your loans, your securities. "
"13522330","13527270"," And they're saying these are like really what is the value of your deposits."
"13527610","13528130"," Right."
"13528310","13531830"," When you have a source of funds at one one and a half. "
"13531930","13533850"," Don't forget this for 24 the four."
"13534870","13535730"," Four or five."
"13536170","13540090"," And those deposits are sticky, which in the case of many of these banks that have. "
"13540250","13542250"," Four thirteen twenty two another basis."
"13542250","13542850"," Those deposits."
"13543030","13544090"," Another place of interest. "
"13544130","13545130"," They've been growing."
"13545150","13545910"," That one above."
"13546350","13547970"," At a very, very low cost. "
"13548090","13551030"," So you have to mark both sides to market."
"13551230","13553990"," And of course, what matters, Kelly, is not."
"13554430","13557650"," I whether somebody has longer term assets. "
"13557990","13560770"," It's that whether their assets match their liabilities."
"13560770","13566690"," So this right here is what we've seen in the case of somebody like Wells Fargo is very."
"13566850","13568090"," Four thirteen thirty seven. "
"13568090","13569610"," Think of all the bad headlines."
"13569970","13573290"," This is the early turn over the last five or six years."
"13573590","13574970"," And yet the deposits have. "
"13575190","13578590"," I know we get there, but whatever 92 percent."
"13579690","13580430"," Four thirteen."
"13580950","13581170"," Right. "
"13581330","13586650"," So, you know, in a way that's longer than your cable bills and very, very sticky and very, very."
"13587290","13593250"," And so people talk about marking the asset side and saying they're in solvent without marking up"

"13594690","13597410"," I think they're just showing some ignorance of basic accounting. "
"13597810","13601070"," But what happens from here, Chris, and kind of broaden this out because obviously you have holdings"
"13601070","13603290"," across the whole economy aside from Berkshire itself."
"13603290","13604530"," You have applied materials."
"13604530","13605450"," You have Texas Instruments. "
"13605650","13606670"," So some semi plays there."
"13606670","13610250"," There's concerns, obviously, about, you know, kind of the glut coming out of the pandemic and the"
"13610250","13612870"," macro factors weighing over the hanging over the face."
"13614130","13618570"," It's not just that they got into kind of a mismatch here because of Fed rate hikes. "
"13618770","13620650"," It's that we appear to be heading into a recession."
"13620990","13622850"," You know, you can quibble about exactly when it's going to start."
"13623030","13625770"," But, you know, that's a is that priced in?"
"13625990","13627810"," I mean, to any of these stocks that you hold?"
"13628270","13633410"," Well, I think when you look at the Fed stress test, you know, of course it seems crazy that it"
"13633410","13634490"," didn't include interest. "
"13634730","13638850"," Right now above the one five minute and hourly triggers making those adjustments."
"13639610","13640530"," A daily trigger."
"13640750","13641110"," Excuse me. "
"13641110","13642230"," But certainly the Fed stress."
"13642370","13647450"," Highs now above one five minute and daily trigger above the hourly trigger for 1345."

"13716670","13720270"," Like lawmakers are basically telling someone that's poor to go fuck themselves."
"13722390","13724450"," It's fucking mind-blowing. "
"13730210","13732330"," It's like straight mind-blowing."
"13733950","13737610"," This shows you how uneducated voters are."
"13738530","13748290"," When lawmakers, when lawmakers tell, try to urge Powell to like,"
"13748790","13750430"," halt interest rate hikes. "
"13751750","13756430"," Basically, if you don't make $300,000 a year, if you don't make, I'll be honest with you, if you"
"13756430","13761270"," don't make $300,000 a year, then your lawmaker is telling the Fed."
"13766620","13768460"," I always find this shit fascinating."
"13771220","13776340"," As a matter of fact, I just got a notice. "
"13777440","13779940"," I just got a notice for a jury duty."
"13782800","13792780"," And the last time I was on jury duty, I'm always fascinated because people that think"
"13792780","13795260"," they're like, yeah, throw the criminals in jail."
"13797500","13800780"," And then a lot of the people that commit DWI are those same people. "
"13804040","13806700"," But you don't hear about how when the law comes for them."
"13810540","13813960"," They're all about rehabilitation and not being put in jail, you know?"
"13814300","13824290"," And so my good point that I'm trying to make too is"
"13824290","13829830"," if you don't make $300,000 a year, you might be like, yeah, they should cut rates."
"13829830","13831710"," I make $100,000 a year. "
"13831750","13832970"," I make $120,000 a year."

"13835010","13835990"," Fuck the pours. "
"13837090","13840430"," But the reality is, you're more than likely more poor than you think you are."

"13856590","13858790"," Your wife, your kids, your dog, or whatever."
"13859310","13864050"," And of course, there's a section of that population that's like, cut rates."
"13865830","13871990"," And basically you have to make pretty much up more than 300, about 300 grand a year to even be"
"13871990","13873270"," like, yeah, fuck it. "
"13873350","13874390"," I don't care if eggs go up."
"13874790","13875710"," It doesn't impact me."
"13877230","13881190"," That's a very small portion of our society. "
"13882690","13883990"," Not that many people."
"13885830","13889970"," Your friends and you might make turn to grand a year, but most people don't."
"13890010","13891650"," They might say they do, but they fucking don't. "
"13894130","13900800"," But I was like some reading it right now."
"13900880","13905020"," It's like a lawmakers urge funds pile to halt interest rate hikes."
"13905780","13906520"," Are you insane?"
"13912410","13912850"," Insane. "
"13917340","13919080"," Yeah, I'm not talking about one good year."
"13919620","13924020"," Time about year after year, you're making like low mid six figures."
"13925240","13927220"," And you expect to make more too, of course. "
"13931300","13932740"," Here's that recheck right now."
"13932860","13934900"," We're going to get the recheck on."
"13936020","13938360"," We're going to get the recheck right now on the. "
"13940400","13941760"," We'll show it to you right now."
"13944680","13949060"," Here's the recheck on that I was telling you about."
"13949060","13949240"," Right?"
"13949420","13949860"," Here's the cross. "
"13949960","13951320"," I'm going to make a nice and big for you."
"13953420","13955320"," Here's the bull cross right here."
"13956020","13957220"," Just so you can identify it, right?"
"13958400","13960340"," And you're going to get a recheck of it. "
"13961420","13963340"," And you're going to see sellers come in here."
"13963900","13968840"," So sell side right does not want this to happen."
"13969560","13973880"," If you're if you've got a big room full of professional sellers right now, if they're in this big"
"13973880","13976320"," sweat sweaty boiler room. "
"13976320","13978540"," We'll be expecting results from the Fed Reverse repo."
"13980580","13982520"," This is where they come in right here."
"13983080","13986520"," They try to sell this and create a bull trap here. "
"13987860","13989200"," Reversal, where it's the downside."
"13991740","13997180"," If they're unable to do this, we end up violently squeezing higher."
"13998700","13998820"," Violent. "
"14001020","14003880"," And what they do is they take the opposite side of the trade."
"14003880","14010160"," So if they're short this market, they will buy this market, stay short, or take their money and"
"14010160","14010320"," run."
"14010960","14012720"," But they will buy this market here. "
"14015400","14019160"," And they'll buy it and run it up until the next place that they can short."
"14020320","14027900"," Which right now is showing itself as 413.46. And this 412.30 area above."
"14030520","14032600"," So if there's a boiler room, we start to trade higher. "
"14032840","14036860"," They will take the trade long and they will look to jump back in short above there."
"14041220","14043360"," And you can actually see it right now."
"14044220","14045140"," We're right below me. "
"14046540","14048260"," That's their last stand right there."
"14054320","14056320"," So you can either get out of your calls."
"14056400","14058800"," You have 410 C's and now 71 cents. "
"14059500","14063380"," If you had been DC-ing all the way down, you should be doing quite well right now."
"14063580","14064920"," Now trading 72 cents."
"14066000","14070280"," If you wanted to take some off and just leave 25% on for this trip higher. "
"14070860","14072540"," To see if you get a fat payday."
"14073160","14073960"," So be it."
"14077030","14078930"," Now trading 73 cents. "
"14079690","14081230"," 410, 74 cents."
"14084030","14086090"," You should see a squeeze higher."
"14088390","14090570"," Just had a nice check here on the one minute. "
"14092030","14093990"," We're going to check the five minute real quick."
"14096210","14098730"," So just noting risk as a nice cross down below."
"14099070","14105970"," We're now trading above on the five minute chart, the one minute trigger or the 27 EMA in the five"
"14105970","14106470"," minute chart. "
"14107450","14108910"," We are now trading above it."
"14114690","14116510"," There's your real little red line right here."
"14116610","14117390"," Your target above. "
"14123740","14125520"," We'll see if the bulls can hold on here."
"14135980","14137840"," Could see a liquidation break at some point."
"14137940","14139620"," You're going to piss off sell side right now. "
"14140700","14143840"," Trading 75 cents on 410 C's."
"14152810","14154450"," I'm going to try to see these sellers going to come in."
"14154590","14155910"," They're pretty pissed off right now. "
"14174300","14174820"," Thanks, Mickey."
"14187900","14188760"," Steady as she goes."
"14190720","14192660"," We're now staying on the five minute charts. "
"14192860","14194140"," I don't want you all to panic out there."
"14205520","14207440"," See if the bulls can do it here or not."
"14214520","14220080"," Let's see if we can squeeze out some of these sellers up to the little red squiggly line up here. "
"14221000","14221880"," This one right here."
"14241780","14242640"," Steady as she goes."
"14244540","14249860"," Trading 410.06. Keep her own. "
"14250000","14251440"," Squeezing 410."
"14255300","14257020"," This is all her stepping in right now."
"14257100","14258280"," See that big red ball right there?"
"14259480","14260380"," Trying to reverse it on you. "
"14280140","14286260"," Hourly starting to turn from extreme bearishness to some kind of bullishness."
"14288660","14290940"," I'm going to show you guys on another chart here."
"14297960","14302680"," So the White House says that Bond will discuss initiating a separate budget process during their"
"14302680","14304140"," meeting with Congress leaders. "
"14305400","14306600"," So here's the spy."
"14307640","14309600"," Clean bounce off of the daily trigger."
"14310900","14315360"," This red here is the five minute chart. "
"14315460","14317780"," I want you to pay attention to this red velocity down here."
"14319020","14321300"," And this was extreme bearishness down here."
"14322620","14326000"," Starting to become bullish on the five minute right here, right?"
"14326560","14327880"," It's on the five minute. "
"14329400","14329960"," Okay."
"14330300","14331680"," I want to see this come up."
"14332900","14333460"," Right. "
"14333600","14338300"," See how it goes up goes down goes up goes down expecting it to go up here."
"14340200","14342820"," Remember at the start of this morning."
"14344980","14348040"," We looked at the hourly velocity, right?"
"14348440","14348920"," Remember this morning. "
"14350560","14351340"," Right here."
"14352100","14354780"," Said, yeah, we're rolling over on hourly."
"14355940","14357160"," Expect to come down. "
"14358000","14363480"," And you can actually see right now the hourly is just beginning to turn bullish, not confirmed yet."
"14363960","14369400"," But well, it's like extreme bearishness, which means we should at least have this, even if it's"
"14369400","14369960"," just briefly."
"14372360","14372780"," Makes sense. "
"14373940","14377080"," Now, if we get a reversal here, right, we'll get a green bar down here."
"14377140","14378540"," It'll get even more bloodbathy."
"14379320","14379800"," Makes sense. "
"14380500","14382540"," This is kind of like a do we turn?"
"14382900","14385000"," Do we have a turning point higher here or not?"
"14386060","14394290"," Now, with all that said, we are still bearish on the daily, right?"
"14394570","14397650"," The daily is still saying we have more down to go."
"14398590","14408350"," But just on the intraday five minute, intraday one minute, intraday hourly, it's bullish."
"14408350","14413190"," So just for this time period right now, we're bullish. "
"14413510","14414510"," Now, it's 122."
"14416650","14422670"," So from 122 to 230, it looks like it can be bullish."
"14423110","14428870"," So we're going to watch it for the next hour every 15 minutes and see if we're getting new highs,"
"14428870","14430650"," if we're going to get the print, right?"
"14430830","14437470"," The hourly print from at 130 and then from 130 to 230 and see if we have bullish continuation to"
"14437470","14441610"," the upside, to at least 412.30ish somewhere in there. "
"14442850","14444950"," You can see the flattening up here of the five minute."
"14445810","14450450"," When you see the five minute almost vertical, that's bearish, right?"
"14450670","14454090"," When the five minute starts to flatten, it becomes more neutral and more bullish."
"14455610","14460830"," Now, when you guys are watching these lines, you can see the white line is almost vertical, that's"
"14460830","14461250"," bearish. "
"14461610","14465310"," You see the white line start to flatten out and turn up, becoming more bullish."
"14468930","14475590"," We know from velocity that at least on the one five minute and hourly, it is starting to turn"
"14475590","14475950"," bullish."
"14476350","14480490"," But it doesn't mean we're bullish like the market for the next two, three days. "
"14480490","14487910"," We just know that right now, until we interact up here with the hourly trigger, we're close to it,"
"14488230","14491970"," that there's some, some intraday relief in the market right now."

"14697830","14699730"," Y'all pulled up in here."
"14703590","14705230"," 86 cents right now."
"14705610","14708870"," I was thinking about taking it off. "
"14708870","14711590"," But I'm like, I'm like man, I'm always early."
"14712050","14715530"," Like I feel like I just want to hold it until we get to 412 and then sell it."
"14716550","14717690"," For some of the pay me. "
"14722110","14726130"," You know what I don't want to see happen is like it's always this kind of bullshit, right?"
"14726670","14727790"," They do this nonsense."
"14728930","14731710"," And then it's like 86 cents still all the way up here."
"14732550","14734190"," And then I get really pissy about it. "
"14737200","14740120"," Because dealers are like we're not paying you through 200%."
"14740120","14741220"," Fuck you."
"14751760","14753280"," I always this what happens. "
"14753280","14756420"," Like I take the money and run and it squeezes all the way up here."
"14756580","14760580"," And it's like they're like $1.50. Or I hold."
"14761280","14762700"," And we do this nonsense. "
"14763160","14763900"," They're 86 cents."
"14764140","14765840"," And I'm like fuck three hours later."
"14767720","14768380"," Can't win. "
"14776820","14777680"," Hey, wagatang."
"14777800","14778280"," How you doing brother?"
"14778760","14779420"," Hope all is well."
"14787130","14789110"," Trade in 410 37 right now. "
"14789450","14790450"," 87 cents."
"14791250","14792770"," 88 cents right now."
"14794590","14795810"," 412's are at 10 cents. "
"14795990","14796550"," Now they're at 14."
"14797350","14799850"," Those are up 40% right now."
"14804820","14805620"," Yeah, good to see you bro. "
"14809380","14810680"," This should have brought more calls."
"14815270","14818150"," Never give never give man a shame taking profit either."
"14818150","14821210"," So don't feel like you have to hold all the way up to the end. "
"14822210","14824090"," Remember if you buy back in somewhere."
"14824770","14826270"," You can always not go full."
"14826710","14827270"," I don't know why. "
"14827410","14833190"," I think some of you guys go like full account full account full account full account and do you"
"14833190","14833630"," blow it up."
"14840520","14850000"," Yeah, right now it's this bullshit with the sell side's trying to not capitulate."
"14850960","14852000"," It's making my eyes bleed. "
"14858220","14861260"," I mean, I'm like, I want to get out on sell side, but I don't want to get out on"
"14861260","14862400"," sell side until here."
"14863980","14865560"," Somewhere in here is where I want to sell."
"14868460","14869520"," Or not sell calls. "
"14869860","14871940"," I mean sell the market up here somewhere."
"14877200","14877880"," Full regard."
"14892340","14893800"," Until that time we'll wait. "
"14904040","14905660"," It's like so much drama, dude."
"14905820","14907060"," Just close your shorts, bro."
"14907840","14908620"," We'll short again. "
"14911820","14914200"," No one cares that you fucking did it at the bottom."
"14914440","14915280"," Just close it out."
"14915560","14915940"," We'll be back. "
"14916180","14917840"," We'll come up here and we'll sell the fuck out of this."
"14940710","14942110"," I know cooked sweet tea."
"14942830","14943610"," I assure you. "
"14943610","14950470"," I assure you that if we trade up here, I guarantee there's going to be some bulls going."
"14952330","14954210"," Let's buy some fucking calls now."
"14956690","14958390"," I assure you that's going to happen. "
"14972540","14974240"," Nice little squeeze right there."
"14975720","14976720"," One minute chart."
"14977580","14978400"," Just grind higher. "
"14992300","14993980"," Beautiful little chart right there, right?"
"14996840","14998580"," If price breaks below."
"15001240","15008700"," More than light, this 409.75. 410.06. It's not good for the bulls, so just keep that in mind."
"15010000","15013540"," It's now 1.32. I mentioned that time frame earlier to you. "
"15013640","15021000"," I said from 1.30. Until 2.30. We're going to find out if we switch right here to bearish"
"15021000","15021820"," or if we continue."
"15022460","15024580"," Excuse me, have continuation on for the next hour."
"15029530","15031350"," Check in with the VIX and see what it's saying. "
"15033350","15034490"," VIX can go down some more."
"15041360","15042980"," A little bit of a pullback here."
"15043320","15045200"," We'll see if the VIX can get sold down to the hourly. "
"15046260","15057320"," VIX could like squeeze here to 18 and change 1850 and then roll back down to 17.06. Could"
"15057320","15058260"," be a liquidation break here."
"15076200","15080060"," I'm going to put it back in the five minutes so you can, uh..."
"15092770","15097150"," 4.98. Excuse me, like 4.98 and clean drink more coffee."
"15098310","15100010"," This shit's like a snoozer. "
"15130830","15134070"," I already doing blanket bands that some are blank and unbaning on discard."
"15134350","15135510"," That shit still hasn't happened."
"15135830","15136750"," I got to check on that shit. "
"15142530","15144350"," That was what I was told by the mods."
"15144830","15146510"," So I know we have new mods in there."
"15146630","15147150"," A whole bunch of them. "
"15147830","15151450"," What they were saying was that anyone that got banned was like, there was like their fourth band or"
"15151450","15151790"," something."
"15153630","15155630"," Like they were like, anyone that's saying they're still banned?"
"15157330","15158790"," I don't know if that's you or not, Nick."
"15159470","15160250"," I love you. "
"15160950","15161990"," Let me, uh..."
"15161990","15165790"," We're going to do one, when we start, we're going to start charging at some point for the, we're"
"15165790","15169930"," going to launch, uh, beta tool with the Discord and start charging every month."
"15172050","15172770"," And, uh..."
"15172770","15173810"," We're going to unban everybody."
"15174950","15176670"," Everybody gets an unbanned that day. "
"15181530","15182590"," So it's coming soon."
"15184870","15185650"," Yeah, it does."
"15185830","15186670"," It happens that day. "
"15186790","15189330"," So we're launching a website and what we're doing is twofold."
"15190590","15195270"," The, um, developer and the cost of data is too high."
"15195810","15200250"," Um, it's tens of thousands of dollars every month. "
"15201310","15207150"," Um, so when I'm done, it's going to be, it's going to cost me, uh, a lot of money."
"15207150","15210210"," Probably a hundred grand, uh, to get out of the gate."
"15212290","15218290"," So, um, we're going to do an initial role of the tool for you guys to have. "
"15218830","15224490"," And, uh, we're going to monetize that in the Discord and then turn on the website, uh, and you'll"
"15224490","15226990"," get access to the rest of the tools and shit on the website."
"15227350","15229370"," No increase in price, that kind of stuff."
"15229950","15232750"," Uh, but it's going to have to fund the launch of the website. "
"15233350","15235730"," It's, it's just ridiculously cost, costing me."
"15237730","15238670"," Yeah, don't worry about it."
"15238690","15238970"," I got you. "
"15239150","15240110"," I'm going to get out and ban everybody."
"15240250","15240850"," Give everybody a chance."
"15241290","15242750"," Uh, it's going to be kind of cool. "
"15242970","15246530"," The cool part too is that it's going to pay for, um, the data."
"15246990","15249830"," It's going to pay for daily briefs to be done."
"15249910","15251830"," Like I'm going to pay somebody to do daily briefs. "
"15252810","15254630"," Uh, you're going to get a recorded video every night."
"15255210","15257010"," Um, so we're going to be paying people."
"15257430","15259030"," To provide data and content. "
"15259610","15264350"," Uh, the content and then the data itself and the development of this stuff."
"15264990","15266810"," Uh, cause some of this stuff's kind of cool."
"15267130","15272430"," You should be able to see like, should really get like alerts that were turning down or turning up"
"15272430","15273310"," that kind of stuff. "
"15273510","15274130"," It'll be really cool."
"15275110","15276970"," Um, and we got some shit that nobody has."
"15278250","15280150"," And, uh, I've got some stuff. "
"15281230","15285470"," Uh, we're going to be, you know how Elon must try to shut down the, uh, data coming out of"
"15285470","15285650"," Twitter."
"15286610","15287950"," Uh, we, we got that data."
"15288670","15289730"," Uh, we got it right now. "
"15289970","15294250"," So, uh, we've got what something nobody else has right now."
"15296390","15303550"," Uh, and then we've got, uh, we're trying to develop paper trading and, uh, an options profit"
"15303550","15306750"," calculator, that kind of stuff so that you guys can run trades with me."
"15309310","15310490"," Um, it's really cool. "
"15310870","15311410"," But it's just costly."
"15311690","15313370"," It's fucking costing me an arm and a leg."
"15319320","15320520"," I'm going to look at Apple real quick. "
"15326450","15326770"," Yeah."
"15326910","15329970"," Apple's coming on a, coming up on a, so Apple's trading above."
"15330070","15330510"," It's one minute. "
"15330590","15331130"," It's five minute."
"15331670","15340110"," Uh, I want you to know that, uh, the hourly trigger currently on Apple is at 169.01. 169.01."
"15346760","15354420"," You want to see the price of Apple get above 196 or 169.04. Trading 410.39 right now."
"15354540","15357900"," 410 C is trading 90 cents right now. "
"15359520","15360540"," Burr, baby."
"15364060","15364500"," Burr."
"15369020","15370000"," Yeah, I appreciate it. "
"15370060","15370480"," STT."
"15373030","15373470"," Yeah."
"15373850","15376170"," And what we'll do is, um, it'll be kind of cool. "
"15376390","15377370"," I mean, it'll be one price."
"15378290","15380270"," There's, there's going to be a couple higher levels."
"15383890","15390130"," Uh, it'll be a couple higher levels for some other stuff, but you don't, you're not going to need"
"15390130","15390310"," it. "
"15390530","15395270"," And furthermore, if you're a poor trader, you're going to be able to get by."
"15395270","15396130"," It'll be high with no membership."
"15396710","15398690"," It'll be hard work, but you'll be able to get by. "
"15399090","15400010"," It's worth the money."
"15400170","15406170"," It's basically this, like I shouldn't say that like, Hey, this will make you a profitable trader,"
"15406510","15407930"," but it fucking should."
"15408390","15412930"," There should be no reason for you not to be profitable and no reason for you not to afford it. "
"15413810","15416370"," Should be zero reason why you don't, you can't afford this."
"15418490","15423150"," Trading 410.47, 92 cents and 410 C's."
"15427460","15429320"," I appreciate it. "
"15430880","15432220"," And here's the truth."
"15432240","15434240"," I mean, this is the, this is the actual truth."
"15434840","15435580"," I'll be honest with you. "
"15436600","15440100"," Uh, I've been doing this now for like two or three years."
"15441020","15442560"," Uh, I haven't taken any sponsors."
"15443120","15444700"," Uh, I don't make a lot of money. "
"15444880","15446320"," Like, uh, I'm upside down."
"15446960","15447360"," Right."
"15447500","15449180"," Like in whole, I'm way upside down. "
"15449600","15450680"," Uh, way, way, way."
"15450960","15453520"," So the deal is just like for me to continue to do this."
"15454040","15459400"," It kind of has to, uh, uh, evolve into something that takes care of itself. "
"15459400","15463320"," It shows the kind of job market easing that you want to see."
"15465020","15471800"," Uh, if it doesn't turn, if it fails, if we try this, we launch it and it can't pay for"
"15471800","15474720"," itself and it can't get free daily point."
"15475160","15480240"," If it can't pay for itself and pay for the data and the people and all the time and effort"
"15480240","15486000"," for everyone that's been doing this for free for three years, uh, we'll just shut it down. "
"15486000","15491160"," I'll just go about my way because I have to be able to trade on myself, moan and pay my"
"15491160","15491640"," own bills."
"15492020","15496360"," Uh, that's where it's, where it's like over time over the past three years."
"15496720","15498120"," It's kind of where it's at at this point. "
"15500900","15503240"," Um, so we'll either shut it down, but I got a fucker."
"15503260","15504320"," We're going our own separate ways."
"15505020","15510500"," Uh, or it'll begin to, like, like, a lending way you would expect. "
"15514880","15517480"," It has to grow into something that's self-supporting."
"15517940","15519060"," It's kind of like a business."
"15519060","15524400"," It's not a business, but it's like, let's say I'm a woodworker and I like to woodwork and then I"
"15524400","15526700"," make these tables and my neighbors and my friends are like, yeah, I like this. "
"15527480","15528940"," You're like, okay, I'm gonna make some tables for you."
"15529220","15532220"," And then all of a sudden it's like ten more people want tables, right?"
"15533000","15535560"," I go, I'm not a business when I do this because I love it."
"15536480","15538320"," Um, and I want to continue to love doing it. "
"15538500","15542260"," I don't want it to get to a point where it costs me too much money or time or the"
"15542260","15543460"," ability to continue to do it."
"15544360","15547700"," Uh, and then you get a hundred people that are like, ah, it's fucking make some tables, man."
"15547700","15549660"," I'm like, okay, but I can't make a hundred tables. "
"15549980","15553640"," But then your initial ten people are like, I love making tables."
"15553640","15554460"," I love your table."
"15554700","15556520"," And I got my own cool tables. "
"15556520","15561780"," And while we make tables together, and so the ten of us are now making tables, um, people like the"
"15561780","15562000"," table."
"15562260","15563480"," Some don't, but a lot do."
"15563780","15570840"," And so, uh, you're like, okay, what do we do to, um, make this, be able to make tables in"
"15570840","15571220"," the future?"
"15572180","15577620"," And, um, let it continue on as long as people want those tables. "
"15577620","15580100"," And if they don't want those fucking tables, we'll just shut it down."
"15582380","15585960"," We'll hang out like, like, I know there's like at least a core hundred of you."
"15586020","15588580"," We'll just hang out and fuck off in a discord and shit. "
"15592000","15593140"," We'll just be friends forever."
"15595920","15597980"," We'll just kill the whole Captain Jim James thing."
"15598020","15599620"," I'd rather just hang out too, to be honest with you. "
"15601520","15604920"," And I'd love to get other talent, like on air talent and stuff like that."
"15605100","15606280"," You know, have other people step in."
"15606900","15608960"," There's people that want to do that in the background right now. "
"15609040","15610620"," There's people that want to step in and do some of this stuff."
"15610840","15616620"," So, um, I'd love to look like, I don't want it to be to fuck just Captain Jim James all"
"15616620","15616980"," the time."
"15616980","15621300"," Like, you want to have some other people, uh, be able to shine and do what they do. "
"15621980","15623440"," You see John Haggerty doing stuff."
"15623560","15624080"," See Binky."
"15624300","15624960"," See you wife's boyfriend. "
"15625240","15625620"," You see Winky."
"15626780","15627840"," Uh, all kick ass people."
"15629500","15632260"," Chaz, Joe Donut, Quinn, bunch of people working in the background. "
"15633080","15636120"," And, uh, you know, these people, you got to take care of these people."
"15636280","15640500"," Make sure they're, um, uh, feeling good and stuff."
"15640680","15641660"," Like the mentality is good. "
"15644090","15645350"," They stay engaged."
"15647750","15648730"," You know, that kind of stuff."
"15652660","15653460"," Oh, fuck yeah. "
"15653540","15653860"," I love her."
"15653960","15654880"," She's a holy croissant brother."
"15655280","15656360"," Got my mad love for you. "
"15656460","15657200"," I love all of you guys."

"15757620","15759580"," And, uh, I love that motherfucker. "
"15759580","15760360"," Well, I got to love him."
"15761140","15764940"," And I've never been able to bring myself to just beg and plead for him to come on the show."
"15765120","15766360"," I would love to have him on the show. "
"15767100","15769600"," And a heartbeat, oh, I defended his ass."
"15770240","15775600"," Uh, when people were going after him, I think a year or two ago, people were all over him."
"15776040","15777940"," Uh, in earnings season, we started selling. "
"15778600","15780840"," And they fucking torched his ass on Twitter."
"15781620","15784540"," And I was one of the only accounts on Twitter that backed his ass up."
"15784720","15785480"," I fucking love that. "
"15785620","15788620"," Not one of the only, but mo-, like, there were a lot of motherfuckers fucking with him."
"15788620","15789860"," I fucking love that guy."
"15790700","15792080"," That sucked his dick. "
"15794100","15799560"," But, uh, mostly because he's been such a, uh, I think, whether he's right or wrong, it doesn't"
"15799560","15800060"," fucking matter."
"15800260","15805060"," That fucking guy trades day in, day out, drops hammer knowledge on people."
"15805640","15810600"," One of the best, uh, streams I've ever watched, uh, made me a ton of money. "
"15810840","15813140"," So, uh, I don't, he disappeared, man."
"15813740","15815920"," I don't know if he's back out there livestreaming or not."
"15815920","15817600"," Of course, I'm streaming now. "
"15817780","15822740"," So, past few years, I haven't been able to pay attention or hang out, uh, and follow him, but"
"15822740","15824540"," fucking guy's a legend."
"15825340","15825740"," Period."
"15826900","15828580"," I know people like to hate on him. "
"15829260","15831980"," Uh, and I know that he's pissed a lot of people off out there."
"15833260","15838260"," Uh, which I find funny because, uh, that means he's hitting a nerve for people."
"15838720","15842800"," You know, this is, this is people, you know, like, this is someone on the Internet, is making you"
"15842800","15845680"," angry enough that you're raging on Fintuit. "
"15846800","15848640"," I think that's funny as fuck two."
"15849120","15855020"," Like some, some internet personality and Fintuit's got such a, such a burn up your ass that you're"
"15855020","15856040"," just pissed off."
"15859390","15861770"," You're like raging on Fintuit about him. "
"15863410","15865270"," I find that funny as fuck two."
"15869220","15871240"," I thought he, uh, guy was feeling better."
"15871560","15873100"," He's still sick with, with cancer. "
"15873740","15875360"," I thought he, I thought he beat it."
"15876240","15878020"," Last update that I, well, no."
"15878340","15882360"," So, uh, actually I should, I should, I'm kind of lying here. "
"15883560","15886140"," I know someone who knows him very well."
"15887080","15891740"," And, uh, matter of fact, this person called him recently."
"15892600","15894080"," And I don't think he answered the phone. "
"15895040","15897400"," That's the, the last update that I've had."
"15898220","15900880"," I did ask this person that knows him to call him."
"15906280","15906960"," Yeah, man. "
"15907060","15907900"," Brian Watt, baby."
"15912140","15913560"," Brian Watt is the fucking man."
"15919700","15920920"," He is the man. "
"15925260","15926000"," Squeezing up now."
"15926820","15928580"," 41064 trading the dollar."
"15928980","15932500"," Oh, two on 410 C's, baby. "
"15936300","15937780"," Fuck yeah, Renko's."
"15938820","15941320"," Guy gives free everything, man."
"15941580","15944620"," I don't know how you can actually hate the guy. "
"15944840","15947860"," I mean, I know the guy that, I know he, I know he's said a lot of things like, but"
"15947860","15949440"," I'm crazy rants."
"15949860","15950820"," But he wasn't lying."
"15951180","15954680"," Like when, when he says, like, people follow me, hedge funds follow me. "
"15955220","15958500"," Uh, major players unfintuit follow me."
"15958660","15959140"," I believe him."
"15959340","15960800"," Like, I always believed him on that shit. "
"15962340","15964140"," Uh, that they were following him."
"15964560","15966740"," And, and I don't blame them for following him."
"15966880","15973580"," There's no, when he was up, when he was streaming, I would always tune in because I'm like, hey,"
"15973680","15975580"," man, I'm fucking wanting to take a trade. "
"15975580","15977100"," I want to see what the fuck that guy's doing."
"15977620","15979020"," Well, that's the key right there, right?"
"15979460","15980840"," You're like, all right, I'm going to short the market."
"15980840","15981700"," I'm going to long the market. "
"15982060","15984120"," And I'm going to go check it and see what the fuck that guy's doing."
"15984180","15989480"," Because if that fucking guy is short and I'm going long, I got a fucking good chance wrong right"
"15989480","15989800"," now."
"15991160","15992620"," Not always, but a good chance. "
"15994120","15995680"," Because I'm on the wrong side of that trade."
"15996020","15998020"," And I know that a lot of those people did tune in."
"15998080","16003960"," That's the fucked up part is that the people that hate him on social media, I'm like, you do"
"16003960","16009400"," realize by you freaking out on Fintuit, that means you're actually watching him in incognito mode. "
"16010120","16011680"," You're admitting that you watch him."
"16014180","16016240"," I find that shit funny as fuck too."
"16020460","16023360"," 410 79 410 82. "
"16024520","16026940"," Squeezing the south side out right now."
"16028900","16030100"," Dollar 17."
"16034440","16035160"," Dollar 18. "
"16040340","16043440"," It's going to look a little sweaty in here."
"16056100","16056620"," Is he?"
"16056720","16057320"," Yeah, he's alive."
"16057580","16064020"," So I asked the buddy whose friends in the column or text him and I didn't hear anything back. "
"16064160","16064920"," He said he hadn't heard anything."
"16065000","16067900"," That was the last time we're talking about Buddy since then he may have talked to him."
"16068280","16069820"," But I heard that he was doing better. "
"16070420","16074560"," And I do hope that he's alive and doing well and not fucking dying still."
"16077410","16079910"," Trading 410 90 right now."
"16080470","16086550"," I want to note here, if you don't already know, whenever we trade into a round hole number, we"
"16086550","16088490"," sometimes reverse even briefly. "
"16088890","16089750"," So we're coming into 411."
"16092600","16095540"," You can sometimes see like the Autobots out there."
"16095660","16098600"," The auto algorithms will try to sell only like a dollar, right?"
"16098600","16104360"," 411 412 413 big cells on 410 415 you know, up and down the market. "
"16107580","16108640"," Just be aware of that."
"16110460","16111620"," Tony take it easy brother."
"16114520","16117120"," He told you that he got off Twitter because someone threatened his life. "
"16117320","16127280"," I don't doubt that he was able to make people emotional, right?"
"16127580","16128400"," He has that ability."
"16129500","16132460"," He can make you very happy or piss you off."
"16132960","16136580"," We all know that if anybody, even if you love them, you know that. "
"16138060","16140420"," You like I said, I would just tune in."
"16140560","16142660"," I wouldn't I wouldn't I wouldn't chat with them or nothing."
"16142980","16146620"," Sometimes he had comments disabled then for a period he had them on and then he would have them off"
"16146620","16147280"," and he'd have them on. "
"16147780","16149240"," But I wouldn't even converse them."
"16149300","16150760"," I'm like fuck that ain't talking to that guy."
"16150900","16152620"," The guy's going to shoot me the fuck down in this chat. "
"16154840","16156120"," I'm like ain't saying shit."
"16156580","16160360"," But you already know that when you're watching them that he elicits or not."
"16160360","16165320"," I don't have to listen, but he entices like emotional responses out of you. "
"16168520","16169460"," Take it easy Tony."
"16171660","16173520"," Am I the only one that felt like that?"
"16173700","16177300"," Like I always felt like I was in the presence of greatness."
"16177320","16178700"," I didn't ever want to fuck with him. "
"16179860","16183960"," Of course I'm always like all I have is I have like 1000 questions for him."
"16185840","16188540"," I'd love to do a sit down interview with him."
"16188560","16191280"," I would love to meet him. "
"16192920","16198000"," Have a beer or cocktail do when he used to make drinks on stream and you try to hide it"
"16198000","16199060"," and get drunk on stream."
"16199240","16201200"," He's probably going to say he's never done that."
"16201400","16204980"," But I can hear the fucking cubes and the little fucking rocks glass in the background. "
"16205580","16206700"," I'm like I know that sound."
"16207520","16208380"," I've been there."
"16208640","16213660"," I've done it on stream trading for 1105 right now just squeezed and higher. "
"16215100","16218520"," For 10 straighten a dollar 41 right now."
"16219540","16220100"," So."
"16221440","16223620"," But I would like to meet him and like get to know him. "
"16224240","16228360"," Without knowing and too much information just like small talk."
"16229220","16230400"," Get to know him."
"16232290","16234410"," But be like look here I want to meet you. "
"16234830","16236530"," But don't fucking tell me anything."
"16238370","16243690"," And then I want to interview him long format on like a Saturday or Sunday."
"16243690","16246330"," Not a live stream or maybe a live stream. "
"16247610","16252030"," And then answer questions throughout the day from people in the live stream."
"16252830","16254730"," And I have a list of questions."
"16255090","16257250"," I have an actual list of questions for him. "
"16258630","16260770"," But just ask him long form questions."
"16261150","16265550"," Have a cocktail with him and have him on the show for like two, three hours."
"16265710","16267870"," Hold on it takes one, two, three hours. "
"16268530","16272330"," Have a few cocktails and let him just talk man."
"16273590","16276910"," Now trading for 11 18 right now."
"16277650","16278690"," Dollar 43. "
"16279970","16284030"," There's now 376,000 calls on 410 C."
"16294440","16295560"," You're welcome."
"16296160","16301120"," Yeah, maybe you guys know him better than I do."
"16301200","16306180"," If any of you guys out there know I the one person I know that says he knows him. "
"16308760","16311640"," Has reached out to him and I haven't heard anything back."
"16311640","16312720"," Or I may have not."
"16312840","16314260"," I may have actually heard back. "
"16314380","16314880"," Don't even know it."
"16314960","16317540"," But he hasn't reached out and said he's reached out."
"16317740","16321600"," But if you guys know him, I would be more than willing to interview him. "
"16322400","16326100"," He's one of, you know, there's like a short list of active traders out there."
"16326100","16327120"," He's on that fucking list."
"16329180","16329940"," He's legendary. "
"16330380","16339900"," And furthermore, you'll you if you know who he is and you're young, there'll be a time when you're"
"16339900","16348680"," old and it'll be like street cred that you knew him or you traded beside him on a live stream"
"16348680","16354480"," or one day when he's an old guy, like when you look at guys like this guy right back here."
"16355600","16356560"," Victor Nederhofer."
"16357340","16358660"," I love this fucking guy. "
"16359280","16360740"," Some people hate him, but I love him."
"16360880","16361540"," The Victor Nederhofer."
"16363260","16368620"," This guy is old now, but he still fucks around and finned to it. "
"16369720","16373620"," Comes on finned to it all hours and knows when return is happening."
"16374100","16375420"," Makes comments on finned to it."
"16376840","16385000"," Like so like one day when he's getting older and you've got this new generation or two of trainers"
"16385000","16387580"," underneath you like another decade or two from now. "
"16389220","16391220"," Trust me, you'll be like, do you remember?"
"16391380","16393720"," Do you remember the goat, Mr. Yen?"
"16393939","16394500"," Do you remember Brian Watt?"
"16395400","16398419"," You know, and only if you were here would you have known who he was."
"16399040","16403680"," So that's a pretty big badge of honor for you to be like, yeah man, I used to watch his"
"16403680","16404099"," live streams."
"16404740","16406439"," Yeah man, I used to trade next to that motherfucker. "
"16406619","16407439"," That guy made me money."
"16407700","16411919"," That guy made me laugh my ass off, maybe cry, maybe care about him because he was sick."
"16412419","16413259"," Like all kinds of shit. "
"16414340","16420080"," I'm not going to talk about his personal life on my stream because I think that's probably fucking"
"16420080","16420460"," devastating."
"16421779","16423540"," I'm never going to broach that subject."
"16424020","16425060"," That's not for me to talk about. "
"16426320","16433810"," But yeah, yeah, you'll hear people right now."
"16434470","16440169"," Like all these old pit trainers, floor trainers, I hold them in the highest regard."
"16440390","16445070"," Even if I like them or dislike them personally, I still hold them in the highest, highest regard"
"16445070","16446830"," because those guys will be gone one day. "
"16449390","16451050"," Sell a rage coming in right now."
"16451390","16452509"," I'm at 4-11-38."
"16455619","16458060"," I hold those guys because they're going to be gone one day. "
"16458380","16460939"," And there's traders that came from the Yahoo days."
"16462400","16466880"," You meet somebody, as a matter of fact, Eric Hagar is out there, right?"
"16468860","16472660"," That guy was a floor trader during the 1987 crash."
"16473279","16473860"," He was there. "
"16475099","16478980"," So like you meet that, you meet Eric Hagar and you're like, can you just tell me what happened?"
"16480279","16481540"," That shit's invaluable."
"16482279","16483680"," That shit's lost to history."
"16484259","16486619"," These are real people, real traders just like you. "
"16487700","16492580"," And there's value in those people's experiences."
"16495419","16502340"," Remembering those experiences as a younger trader, trying to dig them for information for yourself"
"16502340","16503660"," as you become an older trader."
"16504480","16507759"," So one day you can pass that along to another generation. "
"16508720","16510040"," You know, that's the hope, right?"
"16510279","16518840"," The hope is that like a Brian Watt or an Eric Hagar or a Jedi Marcus or you can just"
"16518840","16519480"," list them off."
"16519700","16520619"," They're all out there, right?"
"16521540","16528360"," You can just list them off and these people, if they have spouse upon you, their experiences and"
"16528360","16529980"," you can apply them to your own trading."
"16530300","16536060"," And then when you're an old fuck, when you're 50, 60, 70 years old and there's some 20 or 30"
"16536060","16539880"," or 40 year old and you're like, hey, look, man, I'm going to show you an easier way. "
"16540259","16542340"," It probably came from one of those fucking guys."
"16543300","16545480"," A Bob Kendall, there's another guy right there."
"16545580","16546660"," I love fucking love Bob Kendall. "
"16546800","16547779"," A fucking guy taught me more."
"16548660","16554540"," I just pay that guy fucking a bunch of money to teach me because of his age, because the fucking"
"16554540","16555640"," guy's been in the market forever."
"16556560","16559660"," A fucking guy was trading the dollar yen back in the 70s and shit. "
"16560300","16563500"," Like, how do you fucking, can't buy that in a book or in a course."
"16565520","16566540"," Can't buy that shit."
"16567439","16572160"," Can't even read a book to get that experience and knowledge. "
"16572400","16573580"," You got to, like, meet those guys."
"16574880","16579800"," Listen to them when they talk and, you know, not that you have to be like, yeah, I am that"
"16579800","16582939"," guy, but, or I agree with that guy, but go listen to those motherfuckers."
"16583640","16584619"," That'll make you a better trader. "
"16600529","16604790"," Brian has stories to tell from his days in narco law enforcement plus trade and he should write a"
"16604790","16604930"," book."
"16605090","16605369"," Absolutely."
"16606390","16607570"," I don't know. "
"16607750","16610790"," Has anybody ever interviewed him long format, like, two, three hours?"
"16611150","16616110"," I would even do it over the course of many sessions, like two or three sessions and just because he"
"16616110","16617130"," deletes a lot of shit."
"16618730","16620910"," You kind of have to have been there."
"16622189","16626290"," He's got no record of himself other than us telling each other's stories. "
"16631580","16632720"," That's right, tacit knowledge."
"16634720","16635240"," Yep."
"16638060","16639099"," Wisdom, right?"
"16639099","16641220"," Wisdom is a different thing, right?"
"16641360","16648200"," When's wisdom comes with time and wisdom is not cheap or easy to get. "
"16648880","16657080"," It's either through experience or having the ability to put heavy weight on that experience from"
"16657080","16661720"," someone older or from your own experiences from fucking shit up."
"16687119","16689919"," My friends are taking the money and running right now."
"16694869","16697750"," I'm getting rocket ship text messages right now. "
"16702759","16703480"," That's right, Dane."
"16705240","16706320"," That stuff's all important."
"16706580","16709259"," If you're an investor day trader, it doesn't matter. "
"16709380","16711279"," A little bit of liquidity break in the market right here."
"16711419","16714580"," Just keep your eyes on the dome over here."
"16714880","16715480"," Right below me here. "
"16715520","16718020"," You can see that there's no real support here trying to do a rug pull."
"16718800","16720820"," Just be careful if you're going to try and take some money and run it."
"16720820","16721320"," I don't blame you. "
"16724640","16725919"," I'm going to take a look right now."
"16726000","16728960"," There's some resistance here because of the hourly trigger on Apple."
"16729619","16731500"," Some sellers stepping in right now. "
"16731800","16732980"," Let's take a look at the VIX in the background."
"16734919","16736480"," VIX trying to find its legs."
"16736680","16739040"," VIX traded all the way down to the hourly trigger. "
"16740099","16742200"," We're going to find out here if we start to bloodbath it."
"16742300","16742820"," Be careful here."
"16742900","16744380"," You could get up some blood in the market here. "
"16744660","16745740"," You might want to take the money and run."
"16751300","16753000"," You're going to try to sell this right now."
"16753000","16754540"," They're trying to come in right here. "
"16755099","16756740"," I'm trying to sell this right now."
"16758919","16761060"," VIX bounced off the hourly trigger."
"16761460","16765900"," It's trading up into the daily trigger and the five minute. "
"16766480","16770840"," We'll see if it reverses course and heads even lower or if it begins to blood."
"16771020","16771880"," We bloodbath this close."
"16772340","16773700"," It's now two o'clock in the afternoon. "
"16774660","16776200"," You're going to hear people out there."
"16776240","16784980"," If we do start to sell, they'll say, oh, we're selling because of the panic for tomorrow's FOMC"
"16784980","16785500"," rate decision."
"16786280","16787660"," It'll give you that as being the reason. "
"16787660","16788700"," It's not the reason."
"16790800","16792580"," It's not why we're selling right now."
"16793080","16796500"," This would be the idea that we sell down into this close. "
"16796800","16797680"," Just be careful of this."
"16801240","16803340"," I'm coming down a little bit sooner to sell right now."
"16803420","16804120"," I'm going to show you the VIX. "
"16805200","16806860"," You can have an idea of what I'm talking about."
"16814250","16815330"," Just right here."
"16818730","16822090"," The VIX coming to the bottom of the five minute of bearishness, right?"
"16824250","16832120"," Price is $18.08. Caught a bounce down here. "
"16832820","16834240"," Came back up to it's one minute."
"16834820","16840680"," Now it's coming up to interact with the five minute and the daily trigger here."
"16841640","16847700"," Now if VIX reverses to the downside, we should see a squeeze into the close. "
"16848520","16856360"," If VIX is able, price of the VIX is able to get above $18.20, you will see a bloodbath"
"16856360","16857940"," into the ballot for PM."
"16858480","16865340"," So if you are a bear or bull, you want to pay attention to the VIX, if the VIX is"
"16865340","16873800"," able to get above $18.27, you are then going to expect a bloodbath into the bell today."
"16874460","16878520"," So pay close attention as the rest of the day unfolds. "
"16879860","16884000"," It will lead you to where we are headed into this bell."
"16887750","16906400"," On the dome baby, I'm"
"16906400","16910080"," going to keep my eyes right now squarely on the VIX here."
"16912760","16914180"," I want to see what happens here. "
"16914880","16923920"," If you are a bull on the close, you want to see price on the VIX get below $17.83."
"16943930","16948290"," I ran the scanner once more."
"16949110","16949950"," I think it's tight here."
"16951430","16953610"," So Dash was on my scanner earlier. "
"16958060","16960880"," Yesterday Dash was on my scanner and it's not on it right now."
"16961340","16962520"," Let's see if it came back up."
"16962860","16964220"," Hold on a second here. "
"16964600","16965380"," Nope, wrong scanner."
"16969060","16971120"," Let me run the scanner right now and see what's going on."
"16973790","16975410"," So right now, just a heads up. "
"16975830","16977970"," I have a scanner that runs those tickers."
"16977970","16987090"," So when I post tickers and say look at Dash, as long as that ticker stays on the scanner, it's"
"16987090","16987530"," good to go."
"16987890","16991890"," So that ticker was on the scanner yesterday and it is not on the scanner today. "
"16997800","17005620"," As a matter of fact, I got zero tickers on that scanner today."
"17010410","17017490"," On Dash, if you want some insight on Dash, as long as Dash holds, you ready for it?"
"17017490","17024650"," As long as Dash holds 6184, the move is still higher."
"17025450","17028490"," That trade is dead if we trade below it. "
"17034000","17045650"," I would like to see though Dash come back to, I"
"17045650","17049870"," don't know if I needed to come back to $60.37. It's still bullish."
"17050410","17051870"," It's not on my scanner anymore."
"17055620","17058620"," On its hourly, it's not bullish. "
"17060860","17062780"," I'm going to expect a pullback."
"17063520","17066100"," But overall, I'm bullish on it."
"17067520","17073020"," I'd like to see it come back to $60, consolidate, and then rip higher. "
"17076580","17079460"," Yes, Spy had other plans, apps to fucking loot me."
"17080540","17083260"," But the Spy was showing that we were going to sell the open."
"17084160","17086480"," Spy was showing the clothes yesterday we were going to sell. "
"17087640","17088940"," I didn't take the trade yesterday."
"17088940","17090560"," I talked about it into the bell."
"17090860","17092760"," I was like, man, normally I take this trade. "
"17093120","17094040"," I should have taken the trade."
"17094740","17096960"," I didn't take it because it was breaking one of my rules."
"17097500","17098640"," I was like, man, we got fucking. "
"17099220","17101500"," I was like, we're not going to get a move like this into this rate hike."
"17103580","17104140"," We did."
"17104240","17104660"," We got the move. "
"17105100","17110280"," Actually, this morning before the open, I was like, we don't trade to the rate hike, really."
"17110960","17112820"," That's actually what took place down here."
"17112940","17113820"," We didn't trade to the rate hike. "
"17114400","17115780"," We're just trading where the market is."
"17130340","17132020"," I'll show you Dash right here."
"17132120","17132300"," Hold on. "
"17132520","17134120"," You guys have a lot of questions about Dash."
"17134500","17134680"," Hold on."
"17141000","17141620"," Here's Dash. "
"17146320","17147680"," It can continue to go up here."
"17147840","17149660"," Daily is not oversold yet or overbought."
"17150020","17151060"," Daily is still good on Dash. "
"17153620","17155500"," Hourly is rolling over though."
"17155840","17160760"," In the next couple hours, kind of bearish."
"17163380","17167020"," But not like, not like, hey, sell Dash down to $30 or anything. "
"17168840","17170060"," And a 30 minute chart."
"17171000","17173420"," So I tend to watch these charts on the one and 30 minute."
"17175400","17177860"," In the 30 minute chart, it looks good right now. "
"17181260","17184300"," The hourly is looking a little bit bearish here, but the daily is looking good."
"17185840","17188040"," Overall, generally speaking, I like it."
"17188360","17189480"," I like it right now. "
"17189540","17190740"," I like the consolidation here."
"17191500","17199900"," As long as Dash can hold 61.86, the trade is higher."
"17201240","17208320"," Stop loss below 61.86. I am interested in taking the next leg of this trade though on consolidation"
"17208320","17209020"," here. "
"17209840","17214140"," Take a long again right here with a stop underneath."
"17215960","17218320"," If we consolidate and it moves higher."
"17220460","17223100"," I think they still have an ER coming out, right?"
"17223880","17226280"," And you need to wear out these sellers here, right?"
"17226600","17231420"," As soon as you wear those sellers out, we're going to close the gap above in the 70s. "
"17232760","17233900"," Actually higher than that."
"17234100","17235420"," You got trapped sellers above here."
"17235500","17239800"," It's 75.97. They have their earnings coming up here. "
"17240960","17242020"," It looks good so far."
"17242020","17248240"," Also, Uber did very well on their earnings."
"17250440","17256220"," So I would give the benefit of the doubt to Dash heading into their ER. "
"17258300","17260400"," So we already took this part of the trade."
"17261320","17267420"," If we can get down to like 60 bucks, 6038, I'd be down to buy this consolidation and squeeze higher"
"17267420","17268980"," on Dash."
"17268980","17272220"," You have to remember though that market conditions will dictate. "
"17273640","17276140"," Market conditions will dictate Dash too, right?"
"17276340","17278280"," You might be like, hey, I'm super fucking bullish on Dash."
"17278480","17279300"," Why is it rolling over?"
"17280060","17283540"," If the market's rolling over, I just ran a scan in the background on tickers."
"17284040","17293640"," So normally what I do is this is I run this scan when the market is selling and I run"
"17293640","17294240"," this scanner. "
"17294840","17299520"," So when we're in like full fare, when you guys are out there on live, so earlier today when I"
"17299520","17303780"," was in live stream and I was doing some shit and I was like, hold on a minute, I can't"
"17303780","17304540"," talk, I'm doing something."
"17305780","17308060"," It's because I was running a scanner in the background."
"17309300","17317340"," And what I'll do is I'll run this scanner when the market is selling off and look for tickers that"
"17317340","17321640"," are not selling off or they're not beta, they're high growth stocks. "
"17322280","17327500"," A basket of high growth, recent IPO like the last three years."
"17328220","17334740"," A bunch of other shit like kickass earnings, kickass guidance, kickass real money coming in."
"17335480","17339580"," They have like a basket of this shit and I'm like, well, if this shit's still going up while the"
"17339580","17344060"," market's selling off, that means that a hedge fund is long this fucking thing. "
"17345400","17347220"," And there was zero came up today."
"17348000","17350000"," That's a rare thing to see."
"17351080","17355320"," So when we're selling off, typically at least one, two, three pop up, those are usually my best"
"17355320","17361920"," buys because if they're fucking, if these things are cranking and they're not selling off in a down"
"17361920","17367320"," day, in a panic day, that's bad news, right?"
"17367740","17369560"," So it's not on there right now. "
"17369640","17370720"," So I'm a little weary here."
"17375900","17379940"," But that was on my list yesterday, the day before I think yesterday, day before something like"
"17379940","17380080"," that."
"17382600","17384320"," Some weakness right now in the spy. "
"17384980","17389860"," We're going to roll over, going to go down here and retest the one minute at 41022."
"17390740","17392880"," Find out if we get weak into the bell here."
"17393380","17396320"," Don't forget, we've got the gap down below for a 601. "
"17397220","17400360"," We've got the daily trigger as a retest down here."
"17401140","17403000"," We'll find out where the daily trigger is on the spy."
"17407040","17408640"," Doom, doom, doom, baby. "
"17408640","17415940"," Give me more doom into, give me more doom into four, eight, sixty."
"17416500","17424290"," The more doom, the better into this four, eight, sixty."
"17425050","17430570"," The more doom, the better into this fed rate announcement. "
"17432350","17435190"," I like the doom into the rate announcement."
"17436150","17437530"," Four, eight, sixty."
"17439680","17443260"," Could either signal a double bottom for the move higher. "
"17444220","17451900"," If the sellers can get underneath this daily trigger, the move is lower to close the gap at 40601,"
"17452420","17453940"," 405, 48."
"17454400","17456080"," I'm going to ask if you're a seller out there."
"17456700","17463560"," Please get me down to 400 or 396 at some point tomorrow. "
"17463560","17468740"," The more selling you can do to get us down there, the better off I am to buy a pretty"
"17468740","17471060"," large substantial position to go long."
"17472820","17475260"," Trading 41009 right now, some weakness."
"17475580","17477460"," We'll look at the five minute, or we are in the five minute chart. "
"17479000","17480160"," Go back to the one minute."
"17480380","17481740"," You can see that weakness right here."
"17483620","17485100"," Here's the daily trigger down below. "
"17486000","17493940"," The sell side trying to position itself to put a hedge on the market into tomorrow's volatility"
"17493940","17494360"," event."
"17495180","17498380"," We're going to go over expectations for tomorrow real quick."
"17498520","17500380"," It's now 213 in the afternoon. "
"17500980","17502920"," I'm going to give you some expectations into tomorrow."
"17503300","17504840"," Well, what I'm expecting is tomorrow."
"17506340","17508060"," Let's look at a 15 minute chart. "
"17509260","17510180"," Tight here."
"17514510","17514950"," Okay."
"17515250","17516390"," We got the gap down below. "
"17523750","17527190"," There's some old shit left in the some artifacts from before."
"17530430","17532570"," Let's take a look at this right here."
"17533250","17533810"," Hold on. "
"17533870","17534870"," I'm going to go to a 30 minute."
"17535470","17536210"," Is that better?"
"17536530","17536690"," Okay."
"17536790","17537110"," It's a better. "
"17538390","17539170"," So here's the 30."
"17539330","17540870"," Here's a 30 minute chart right here."
"17545150","17548790"," We got a gap down here 397, 396, right?"
"17549510","17551270"," We talked about that number earlier today. "
"17552070","17555050"," We've been talking about this number for a few days now, 396."
"17562670","17563950"," Hold on a second here."
"17563950","17564890"," Let's go to one hour. "
"17566940","17567600"," Make it easy."
"17569220","17570980"," See, I'm going to mute this chat box."
"17572980","17573780"," Hold on a second. "
"17573880","17574680"," I got some stuff to do."
"17574780","17577140"," We're going to mute the chat box right there."
"17577660","17584720"," We're going to mute my camera to main camera, web camera frame. "
"17585040","17585320"," All right."
"17585480","17585640"," Perfect."
"17586160","17586580"," Awesome. "
"17588340","17588780"," Okay."
"17591210","17592610"," Let's first go to SPX."
"17597270","17598530"," No, no, not SP. "
"17601470","17602930"," I don't know why it doesn't."
"17607540","17608740"," No, not settings."
"17609980","17611560"," What the fuck are you talking about?"
"17618430","17618870"," Okay. "
"17623140","17624900"," I'm going to delete all the drawings here."
"17625500","17625900"," Delete all."
"17626460","17626780"," Yeah, yeah. "
"17626980","17627240"," Delete them all."
"17627640","17627980"," Okay."
"17629360","17630060"," One day. "
"17630860","17632040"," This is where we're going to look at here."
"17633520","17634000"," SPX."
"17635160","17636720"," I fucking hate drawing. "
"17639280","17641100"," Fucking channels and all this kind of stuff."
"17641260","17641880"," We're going to do it anyways."
"17646260","17648320"," This is on the title of my thing today. "
"17648500","17648620"," Okay."
"17649320","17652220"," I think a fat."
"17654420","17655160"," Right there. "
"17656840","17659780"," And now these are like zigzag channels."
"17660520","17662000"," Now these are zigzag channels."
"17662680","17663360"," Right?"
"17663820","17664440"," Negative. "
"17664980","17665320"," Negative."
"17665740","17665960"," Negative."
"17666360","17666460"," Right?"
"17666840","17667340"," Trade up. "
"17668200","17669780"," Check it a second time."
"17670300","17673280"," Find the support to throw us over."
"17674000","17676840"," We back check the negative channel. "
"17677180","17677260"," Right?"
"17677760","17678080"," Look at that."
"17678360","17678740"," Back check."
"17679140","17679180"," Boom. "
"17680320","17680400"," No."
"17681080","17681960"," The way is higher."
"17682760","17683160"," You see that?"
"17683540","17688940"," If we had failed this check here, we would know that the way is lower. "
"17688940","17690680"," Supply and demand."
"17691280","17692320"," Supply and demand."
"17693160","17694380"," Remember me saying that?"
"17694900","17696540"," Supply and demand. "
"17699280","17700420"," Is there demand?"
"17703220","17704680"," Or is there supply?"
"17705040","17707360"," Is there more supply or more demand?"
"17708740","17710200"," We were told the way is higher."
"17716380","17716640"," Okay."
"17718360","17720800"," So if these were zigzag, I'm not going to put zigzag channels. "
"17720800","17724480"," They don't think they have them on this ship, but on a weeble or whatever."
"17724880","17726320"," But you need to see this, okay?"
"17729260","17729620"," Demand."
"17730460","17730820"," Demand. "
"17732120","17732460"," Demand."
"17732940","17733280"," Demand, right?"
"17734160","17736520"," Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell."
"17736920","17737120"," Right?"
"17737240","17738880"," Sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell, sell. "
"17739860","17740700"," Sell, sell, sell."
"17742360","17742720"," Right?"
"17744360","17745980"," So I just want you to see that right there, okay?"
"17746760","17748160"," I'm going to be aware of this right here."
"17749000","17749960"," Up here, right?"
"17750200","17750740"," Squeeze higher. "
"17751480","17752160"," What do you get up there?"
"17752300","17755400"," 4.30. And a summer, August, September."
"17757080","17757780"," 4.30, right?"
"17757980","17758820"," Just look at that right there."
"17761910","17763150"," 4.35, right?"
"17764010","17765870"," Sell, sell, back and forth, back and forth. "
"17766590","17767690"," Can we trade above it?"
"17767930","17768030"," Sure."
"17768930","17769990"," Can we trade below it briefly?"
"17770470","17770590"," Sure."
"17771450","17776570"," If this is the range that we're range bound in, we always know that sometimes we will trade outside"
"17776570","17778350"," of the range that we're in, right?"
"17778350","17781310"," So we can trade higher, we can trade lower. "
"17781710","17783050"," Just another opportunity to buy a dip."
"17783790","17785730"," Another nice high to sell, right?"
"17785890","17786630"," Sell a rip-on."
"17789840","17790480"," So spy. "
"17792000","17793020"," Looking on a daily."
"17794980","17796360"," Let's see it right there, right?"
"17797580","17800280"," 1, 2, 3."
"17800960","17803000"," Starting to get a little toppy in here, right?"
"17804060","17805000"," Just cyclically."
"17805820","17805880"," Right?"
"17806220","17808000"," 1, 2, and boom. "
"17808760","17809380"," Trapped your ass."
"17809380","17812420"," And of course, bears are like, we're going down, man."
"17812560","17814960"," We're going to do 385, 390, 396. "
"17815240","17815880"," We're going to get a bloodbath."
"17815960","17817360"," We're going to get underneath those shins, bloodbath."
"17822510","17822950"," Right?"
"17823090","17830820"," But right now, right now, this is a buy zone down here, right?"
"17830980","17832340"," We have a tick right down here. "
"17833160","17837140"," So just tomorrow and next week, 388, 390."
"17838000","17839840"," Gap to fill at 396, 398."
"17841040","17843280"," I'd love to see this get bought down here. "
"17844720","17845160"," Right?"
"17845540","17846760"," Same by another dip to go higher."
"17847740","17851900"," If it squeezes down here and I'm going to call spread for the next three months, fine with me."
"17852120","17854520"," If you get it done in one day, fucking amen. "
"17855480","17859340"," If you're going to get this shit done on a fucking, on rate hikes, I don't think you are."
"17859740","17860640"," I'll be honest with you."
"17861580","17862940"," But let's say you did. "
"17863980","17864960"," Right down here."
"17865800","17866460"," Make sense?"
"17866940","17867940"," I'm looking to buy this shit."
"17868060","17869380"," You get this shit done in two days. "
"17870720","17871840"," 396, 396."
"17873100","17873480"," That's tomorrow."
"17874360","17874800"," 396. "
"17875860","17876740"," You know what I'm saying?"
"17879240","17881040"," That's 396, right down here."
"17884470","17885550"," Way down here."
"17887410","17888730"," This one right here. "
"17888970","17890350"," This looks like a speed bump to me."
"17890690","17891550"," This means nothing."
"17892050","17892410"," Speed bump. "
"17893930","17895690"," Start fucking trading down here."
"17900290","17902310"," I want to see us go lower."
"17903530","17905170"," I want to buy this shit down here. "
"17909660","17910540"," I don't know what that was."
"17910860","17912780"," But let's look back in time here."
"17915400","17918580"," This yellow box down here, we pushed it up, right?"
"17918840","17919400"," Pushed it up. "
"17919660","17920460"," Came back down."
"17920720","17922640"," Found more demand down here, right?"
"17923440","17924540"," See the demand down here?"
"17924880","17925960"," Spent a lot of time here, right?"
"17928200","17930180"," Just another chance to buy and throw it up."
"17931080","17932200"," Comes back down. "
"17932420","17934420"," You're going to expect some buyers down here."
"17934500","17934760"," Make sense?"
"17935280","17936240"," Buyers down here."
"17937320","17939380"," Huge buyers down here, right?"
"17939860","17940280"," 390, 392. "
"17941340","17941980"," That's my expectation."
"17942300","17942560"," It's tomorrow."
"17942560","17946020"," I don't know what the fuck you're expecting to happen tomorrow. "
"17946780","17952700"," But my point to today in this stream is a few moments ago I said to you, if there's any"
"17952700","17955800"," kind of weakness, I'm down to buy it."
"17956200","17957080"," Just give me the chance."
"17957480","17964340"," If you can do that in two days, one, two, and three, three red bar day, fucking bring it on. "
"17965160","17972300"," I hate shit like this taking three days or more than three days, like three sessions and fucking"
"17972300","17972540"," down."
"17973660","17974060"," Right?"
"17974420","17975300"," Told you about this."
"17975480","17977640"," If I could get this today, I'm down to buy these right here. "
"17977860","17980720"," I already know that we had demand here."
"17982160","17982560"," Right?"
"17982820","17983980"," We already knew there's demand there."
"17984720","17986080"," We found demand right here. "
"17986600","17987920"," We already know there's buyers here."
"17988380","17990120"," We already know that the bulls are still in charge."
"17990200","17994640"," We know that if the bulls weren't here, that this way we'd have had a bloodbath into this close. "
"17995120","17998600"," So for right now, we already know we're getting 25 BPS."
"17999480","18001220"," So for right now, my bearish here?"
"18001480","18001640"," No."
"18002140","18003900"," I'm just looking for another chance to buy a dip. "
"18005440","18007180"," Just looking for another chance to buy a dip."
"18008640","18017100"," Whether that's down here at 387, 396, 405, 400, whatever that may be."
"18017700","18023600"," So if you're a bull out there, fuck, and you're looking to put some money on the market, $20, $30,"
"18023720","18024560"," $100,000. "
"18024980","18025860"," Give it to me all day long."
"18026140","18027240"," Give me any of this down here."
"18028160","18028920"," Any of it. "
"18029880","18031900"," Even if we're selling May, you give me that."
"18032100","18032620"," I'll take it."
"18033000","18034200"," I will run that shit up. "
"18035460","18036780"," So just for tomorrow."
"18037480","18039940"," This right here, this gap filled down here."
"18041600","18043160"," Let's see and delete this real quick. "
"18043840","18044600"," Trash that out."
"18050620","18054200"," Another little speed bump right here because I already know there's demand there tomorrow."
"18054220","18055400"," See that demand down here?"
"18057880","18065620"," So if we're weak into tomorrow, into the rate decision, I am going to expect, even if we sell this"
"18065620","18068080"," close, I'm going to expect demand to come in. "
"18068200","18073680"," If we sell this tomorrow, I'm going to expect demand to come in before the rate decision at 405."
"18075540","18077120"," I'm going to expect it down here."
"18078980","18080400"," That daily trigger was not. "
"18081720","18083360"," This fucking daily trigger was up here."
"18084480","18087380"," I'm expecting demand to come in down here, 405, 406."
"18089780","18094220"," One thing about event fall is between if we get nothing crazy tomorrow. "
"18095020","18096720"," If we get nothing and say no."
"18098220","18099900"," Any weakness that we do have."
"18100220","18103860"," This is Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Monday. "
"18105400","18110060"," If we don't have continued selling, or even if we do have continued selling, I'm looking to buy a"
"18110060","18110680"," dip on Monday."
"18111660","18116560"," If we have no bad news tomorrow, we actually have good news and we're looking for this into Friday."
"18116560","18119880"," And believe it or not, I'm still looking for that 420 up here. "
"18121320","18124180"," If we get good news tomorrow, right?"
"18124380","18126560"," We get the weakness that we start to squeeze higher."
"18127540","18130320"," I think it's easy for us to close this gap tomorrow."
"18130620","18130800"," Easy. "
"18131840","18132320"," Easy."
"18133720","18143620"," So for tomorrow, I'm going to expect our true range"
"18143620","18151560"," tomorrow to be somewhere fail to break below 405.48. In a failure to break above 415.20. I expect"
"18151560","18153300"," this range to get traded tomorrow."
"18155240","18159500"," If the news is good, I want to see 420 into Monday. "
"18160240","18165220"," If the news is bad, I want to see into Monday 396."
"18166660","18167560"," Does that make sense?"
"18168200","18169140"," That's how I'm trading it."
"18173370","18176230"," And you better hope that there's some bad fucking news. "
"18176830","18181590"," Because if that event ball comes off tomorrow and there's no bad news, you will see us close this"
"18181590","18182170"," gap tomorrow."
"18183030","18186990"," You will see us trade that 41466."
"18188490","18189710"," You know what I'm saying for tomorrow?"
"18190690","18191990"," So that's where it is. "
"18194960","18195680"," Bad news."
"18196840","18197640"," Good news."
"18199300","18200540"," Squeeze it up, close the gap. "
"18202120","18209220"," Begin to trade it down into bad news like medium news, okay news, whatever or a gasket down here"
"18209220","18210300"," and then up like that."
"18211220","18212440"," Hopefully I can buy a dip."
"18213160","18213740"," Great news. "
"18214720","18216680"," We're fucking blasting off the 420 by Friday."
"18217420","18221760"," And we'll come back down here and see about the 396, 390 or 400 somewhere in there."
"18222320","18223500"," I do want to warn you. "
"18224260","18232160"," The one thing I have to say about this rate decision is I haven't seen like Fed meetings."
"18233260","18238460"," I've seen like material directional changes in the market, these fucking rate hikes."
"18239200","18240340"," Not so much. "
"18241100","18248860"," Market is tended to trade like you'll get the initial reactions, but then afterwards we just"
"18248860","18250020"," continue on doing what we do."
"18250020","18256000"," And you'd have to have like something material bullish or bearish for me to be materially bullish"
"18256000","18260400"," or bearish for me to be like, oh yeah, we're going all time highs or some over that news."
"18262710","18263850"," So there's that 406. "
"18265070","18265770"," There's tomorrow."
"18269840","18273720"," Trap a bear in, something like that maybe down here."
"18273920","18277620"," Maybe you have that bit of weakness right when they were announced and then we start ripping"
"18277620","18278000"," higher. "
"18279120","18280200"," Close up, something like that."
"18281360","18283300"," That's my expectation tomorrow, something like that."
"18283540","18286140"," And I expect us to close this tomorrow without a fucking doubt. "
"18287440","18289280"," You'd have to have some real bad shit, man."
"18289740","18290380"," That's my one though."
"18290580","18295360"," Saying this this morning was that fucking Janet Yellen is the only fly here. "
"18296040","18300940"," Janet fucking Yellen's if she comes out tomorrow, I'm going to be pissed off."
"18301780","18307540"," If she's out there jerking herself off while he's talking or they drop the information and then you"
"18307540","18310740"," get like a surprise Janet Yellen one bullshit talk tomorrow."
"18311640","18312840"," That could be a fly. "
"18313000","18315640"," If you're a bear, you better be begging."
"18316980","18325440"," Begging that Janet Yellen comes in tomorrow and like straight sucks you off because without her."
"18326260","18327340"," I don't know what to say to you. "
"18328360","18330160"," You kind of need her if you're a bear."
"18332750","18334490"," Kind of need Janet Yellen on your side."
"18337310","18341110"," You don't want Janet Yellen on your side but she's your only hope. "
"18344900","18350640"," So like this kind of bullshit panic and then some kind of ripping face."
"18350980","18352940"," This will probably go two ways to probably a failure."
"18354140","18358540"," You'll get up there and then you'll have the interview and then it'll be something like that. "
"18359880","18363500"," If you hear anything good news, if Janet Yellen doesn't come out and spoil the party."
"18365620","18370460"," If Fed Chair Powell doesn't get all hawkish."
"18372900","18374960"," He's like yeah fuck yeah party on. "
"18375120","18382700"," We're positive and we're probably cutting for fucking 20 on spy 430 and 430 by middle of the month."
"18386680","18388600"," Get out of the way."
"18391440","18393360"," You never know man. "
"18394920","18396440"," You never fucking know."
"18401160","18406080"," And there are things or there are things like some of these charts I showed you yesterday."
"18407300","18409380"," They're saying that we're getting that news. "
"18410800","18416000"," So some of the indicators are like some of the indicators are like oh we're going fucking up, bro."
"18417980","18423860"," So no matter what we're doing today, no matter what happens tomorrow, I am fascinated."
"18426000","18428620"," And Temeros is on that same kind of a thing. "
"18431770","18439170"," Temeros is like and some of the news being dropped today is kind of saying the same shit."
"18440290","18445610"," Like some of the news being dropped today is like making me scratch my head."
"18445990","18452610"," You got like south side hedge funds being interviewed by Temerosco and the Fed must have to be. "

"18810060","18811400"," My whole take here is."
"18812040","18813100"," A little second here. "
"18815880","18817480"," Who spies looking bullish?"
"18820420","18821240"," Spies looking."
"18823520","18824400"," Spicy here."
"18829680","18831940"," I mean I agree with what Timros is saying. "
"18832080","18832580"," Oh that's Timros."
"18832780","18834740"," Timros trying to interview bears."
"18835500","18838620"," Not bears but Timros is trying to interview banks. "
"18839560","18841760"," And sell side hedge fund heads."
"18843620","18845340"," We've had that discussion here."
"18847900","18848960"," We've had that discussion. "
"18849240","18850280"," Not a nauseam but."
"18850280","18854260"," We had a mirror on one day and he described it to you as well right."
"18857240","18861760"," Banks institutions have institutional clients so let's say I'm selling a 401k. "
"18862420","18863680"," I'll keep it short and sweet."
"18868870","18870650"," Banks don't want real price discovery."
"18873170","18874930"," Banks want a market that's stable. "
"18875670","18878050"," They want a market that goes to the right and up slowly."
"18879130","18880150"," They don't like volatility."
"18881090","18883430"," They don't like markets that scream higher either. "
"18884370","18888770"," They want consistent returns to the clients so they can say I had nine months of consistent"
"18888770","18889250"," returns."
"18890010","18896250"," We had one crazy month or two and I shorted the market and I saved you in your 401k."
"18897210","18898130"," But look at that. "
"18898390","18900530"," I have consistent returns year in year out."
"18900890","18903250"," Now we might have one bad year every eight years or ten years."
"18904630","18906330"," Or something might have happened that we didn't foresee. "
"18907530","18908870"," We had insurance for that."
"18910410","18913870"," That's down three dollars ninety nine or five percent on the session."
"18916910","18918810"," You have sell side hedge funds. "
"18919030","18920810"," They like to step in and sell right."
"18921130","18921710"," Make their money."
"18922130","18922530"," Take their money. "
"18922790","18923470"," Get out of the market."
"18923750","18924730"," Markets pop back up."
"18924910","18925650"," Come in sell. "
"18926890","18928110"," Just like easy peasy."
"18928330","18928730"," Easy peasy."
"18929410","18930830"," You see that in the hedging in the market. "
"18931730","18935150"," You see that the banks even influence when they put their bare seagulls on."
"18935150","18936150"," When you see JPM caller."
"18936750","18938290"," That's so that we don't have real price discovery. "
"18939310","18942150"," You don't want to ever have a market that has real price discovery."
"18942610","18943910"," You don't want to ever want to see that."
"18944710","18946070"," You want a stable market. "
"18947150","18948630"," Generally speaking over time."
"18949010","18951070"," You want a market that goes up into the right over time."
"18955030","18958350"," Then you have of course the dealers market makers. "
"18959450","18960470"," They're market they want to make money."
"18965260","18968220"," So that that Temeros thing earlier today."
"18968980","18969900"," Somewhere in here. "
"18970360","18971720"," That Temeros thing."
"18972860","18976580"," Earlier today is probably or not probably it is a plea from banks."
"18977700","18980760"," And you know you already know that Jamie was meeting with Yellen. "
"18981160","18983120"," So you know that he's going to tell."
"18984980","18986380"," Jerome and Yellen."
"18986640","18988900"," You guys don't think that they have this conversation but they do. "
"18989360","18991580"," Hey, you got to be hawkish even if you're going to pause."
"18991580","18993820"," Even if you're going to increase rates down the road."
"18993880","18996560"," Just pause down increase in the fall or wait and see. "
"18997060","18998300"," We need you to be hawkish."
"18998980","19000180"," You don't want to see the market."
"19000480","19003700"," Jamie doesn't want to see the market at 400 or 4,600. "
"19004840","19005920"," The next two weeks."
"19007400","19009080"," The market's not hedged for it."
"19009460","19010820"," Dealers aren't hedged for it. "
"19014670","19016690"," Call puts are not are not there for it."
"19017830","19020790"," And the dealers in tomorrow would like nothing less than take all your money."
"19020790","19023550"," They want you to bet for market crash. "
"19024450","19026750"," They want you to bet for all time highs."
"19029870","19031670"," They don't want to take all your money."
"19031830","19034430"," They're going to let you place your bets and they're going to actually send the market in the"
"19034430","19035970"," opposite direction until your shit burns. "
"19036750","19037830"," Then we'll go that way."
"19050380","19050960"," That's right."
"19053280","19056140"," So I would temper your expectations tomorrow. "
"19056880","19063680"," I would trade this market to the market itself and not to rate hikes tomorrow."
"19065320","19070900"," Specifically because it's mostly the mostly unless we have a surprise rate hike or cut."
"19071480","19074060"," I haven't seen too much influence on the market. "
"19075740","19077360"," FFC meetings in the quarter."
"19077720","19082840"," Those I've seen market shifts, but minutes I've seen market shifts."
"19083600","19086000"," But these rate hikes because we know what they are. "
"19086980","19088220"," I haven't haven't seen."
"19090140","19090980"," Not too much."
"19099460","19103620"," Can we do a Twitch channel prediction on if spy will be over for ten or under today?"
"19110020","19111120"," Yeah, we can do that I think. "
"19111320","19112660"," Let me see if Winky can do that."
"19114300","19115820"," Winky, are you out there right now or no?"
"19116880","19117780"," Winky probably took a break."
"19118640","19119420"," Took his money and ran. "
"19121640","19124440"," I'm getting the sniffles."
"19134030","19138150"," Hey, Winky, can we do a maybe two poles?"
"19139190","19139810"," Thanks, Winky."
"19141970","19143430"," Let's have two poles. "
"19145890","19147610"," Come on, that's the last two questions."
"19149930","19150230"," Winky."
"19151830","19155730"," Do we close above or below for ten today?"
"19157350","19158530"," Second question. "
"19161010","19170800"," Do we trade below 405 tomorrow, 405, and we don't need to do the"
"19170800","19171020"," change."
"19171240","19178410"," Do we trade below 405, 50, or do we trade to 415?"
"19179050","19179670"," We'll just call it 415."
"19180370","19181650"," Whoever's fucking close or wins. "
"19184210","19186190"," I guess option three would be to trade both."
"19187790","19189770"," I guess let me do it with crayons."
"19191230","19192870"," Do we trade this and this?"
"19193270","19194650"," Or maybe we'll do a different way. "
"19195210","19197710"," I fucking hate dealers."
"19198770","19200830"," Do we trade this and this tomorrow?"
"19203210","19205430"," Like do we trade to here, into here?"
"19208570","19209090"," Tomorrow."
"19210910","19212990"," Or do we, I guess that's option one. "
"19213190","19214970"," Do we range about tomorrow?"
"19216310","19216970"," Somewhere in here."
"19216970","19221890"," Or do we trade above 415, or below 405 tomorrow?"
"19222810","19229090"," Below 405, above 415, or range bound from 410 to 415."
"19230430","19231810"," That's a key question for tomorrow. "
"19233920","19234360"," Big one."
"19235420","19240520"," And I think the question for today is, do they pin this fucking thing right into the bell?"
"19241820","19243520"," Or do we get blood into tomorrow?"
"19244600","19246080"," It might take on for tomorrow is this."
"19246540","19247660"," I'll just do it right now. "
"19250260","19252720"," I'll just fucking draw it in there for tomorrow."
"19255540","19256180"," Right there."
"19260200","19264420"," Time is at 11.30. I'm back up here. "
"19265260","19270690"," Maybe 11.31.30. And underneath."
"19273690","19274670"," And then I think we go up."
"19276430","19277430"," Failure to close. "
"19283050","19284010"," Maybe bloodbath."
"19284250","19285330"," Maybe right there."
"19286810","19287610"," That's what I think. "
"19289550","19290610"," Something like that."
"19295380","19296420"," That's what I think we do."
"19297440","19300300"," Don't hold me to the exact line somewhere in there. "
"19303080","19304340"," Let's see what that looks like."
"19305100","19307140"," Yeah, it's some shit like that, isn't it?"
"19308900","19310300"," And some kind of garbage."
"19314540","19315880"," We go way higher. "
"19316620","19317300"," Worst news."
"19317720","19318860"," We go way fucking lower."
"19319940","19320700"," Makes sense. "
"19321420","19323820"," All bets off above this and above below that."
"19342830","19343890"," Kind of gross, right?"
"19344410","19346650"," You know what would be the worst thing for tomorrow?"
"19347090","19349590"," I think this happened last rate increase."
"19350750","19352410"," You know what would be the worst trade for tomorrow?"
"19353310","19354910"," This fucking trade right here. "
"19360050","19361290"," This one right here."
"19361810","19362330"," Come down."
"19364910","19365910"," Brief moments. "
"19366190","19366790"," Brief moments."
"19367150","19368330"," Can we close right here?"
"19368970","19370150"," You do that shit right there."
"19370910","19371470"," Oof. "
"19372950","19376270"," Like we just get range bound at 408 and 411 tomorrow."
"19377050","19377610"," Oof."
"19380190","19383790"," And then theta gang just takes over for like three days. "
"19385630","19387390"," Theta gang's out there right now."
"19387530","19389710"," They're just like fuck all of you bears and bulls."
"19392550","19394070"," That would be classic. "
"19395290","19397650"," They just burn this whole entire thing."
"19398250","19400270"," Close the gap on Friday above here."
"19400930","19402470"," Start selling next week. "
"19404250","19407490"," Dealers fucking just rake in all bulls and bears money."
"19408090","19409510"," Theta gang is the real enemy."
"19412410","19414770"," Close the gap on Friday for the bulls. "
"19418670","19421570"," And then we get relentless selling on Monday."
"19421570","19422650"," Nobody's short."
"19426280","19428780"," Yeah, we get Apple too, baby. "
"19429540","19432100"," We got bunch of reports too still, don't we?"
"19436780","19438740"," Just range bound this shit."
"19440080","19442280"," Bunch of reports come out for the next week."
"19443400","19448240"," You know we squeeze up and down in the four o'clock to four fifteen hour. "
"19450080","19452360"," Apple's done reporting and then we start selling."
"19460060","19466860"," I don't know man."
"19470140","19470540"," Nice. "
"19470680","19471460"," We got the thank you."
"19471520","19473380"," You're putting that those questions up."
"19474040","19475480"," Bill Ackman was do you guys. "
"19475720","19476580"," I was talking about this."
"19476760","19480720"," There was a whole like New York Times did an opinion piece where they had."
"19481020","19483400"," They were like the week he and I were talking about us a couple of weeks ago. "

"20836400","20837580"," not want to be short there."
"20841490","20845410"," I'd probably lift the short off the market just for that press."
"20845410","20847510"," Not the presser, but the press release. "
"20848930","20851490"," I would be afraid of anything saying pause."
"20853170","20858370"," And then I would hope to pull my shirt back on once the presser starts so that he can get"

"21285000","21286160"," Thirty minute chart okay."
"21288260","21290400"," This is when AMD looks bearish."
"21291720","21292400"," Right there. "
"21295240","21297820"," So you go down right here."
"21298400","21300960"," AMD looks bearish and it went down."
"21301160","21301820"," See right there. "
"21306820","21308900"," Right here AMD looks bearish."
"21311120","21311880"," Went down."
"21312060","21313600"," Well it took longer to go down on that one. "
"21314060","21316580"," Took a few more days but we charted it right there."
"21317000","21318180"," It's still tagged it though right."
"21318840","21320320"," So when we're down here we're bullish. "
"21323300","21325940"," This one right here didn't see it."
"21326200","21329540"," But there's another one that you guys can't see on this chart that's somewhere else."
"21332120","21333640"," Bullish right. "
"21333640","21334660"," This is bearish."
"21334660","21335780"," This is extreme bearishness."
"21335960","21339340"," Extreme bearishness bearishness bearishness bearishness. "
"21339880","21342140"," So right now it's cyclically at least."

"21344200","21351220"," The green is intraday bearish bearish bearish bearish bullish bullish. "
"21352820","21357240"," Right here on its own looks bull bearish on the hourly."
"21357240","21359280"," But on the daily looks bullish."
"21361440","21370540"," So my point here is that AMD looks like weak into the close but into tomorrow strong. "
"21371800","21373240"," Does it make sense where I'm getting that from?"
"21382530","21384610"," Yeah you bought $12 shares a few years back."
"21384810","21385210"," Should have held them."
"21386070","21386650"," Yeah I like AMD. "
"21388130","21389190"," I like it for a new trader."
"21389690","21393550"," I feel like a new trader can make a lot of money in AMD to kick ass."
"21394650","21398530"," Like you remember back in the day with AMD you could just like buy a dip. "
"21399150","21400390"," Hold it for three weeks."
"21401250","21402410"," There's just like a money printer."
"21403170","21407250"," You could sell it three weeks later or a week or two later collect some money. "
"21407550","21409290"," Go back right back in and buy it."
"21409330","21410710"," It was a great ticker."
"21411890","21413930"," I'm going to look at it right now in the background here. "
"21414210","21414930"," I fucking love it."
"21415050","21415770"," I used to love AMD."
"21416950","21419450"," Like one of the simplest tech trades you could do. "
"21419850","21421050"," It's a beautiful thing man."
"21425390","21426610"," You'll look at it right now."
"21428370","21432750"," Yeah man back in the day dude AMD just perfect. "
"21435260","21436580"," Such a great ticker."
"21438470","21439750"," I'm looking at it right now."
"21445450","21447170"," And AMD was so awesome. "
"21448790","21450390"," Like roll over by the dip."
"21450970","21452230"," Roll over by the dip."
"21452370","21453230"," Roll over by the dip. "
"21453370","21454130"," Roll over by the dip."
"21454270","21455010"," Roll over by the dip."
"21455610","21456870"," Even when it was going down. "
"21457110","21458090"," Roll down by the dip."
"21458230","21459050"," Roll down by the dip."
"21459930","21461230"," It's a fucking love this ticker. "
"21471310","21473770"," Yeah I didn't buy AMD back then."
"21476940","21479040"," This is like a 2000."
"21482440","21483380"," Oh I want to say. "
"21485160","21488120"," Yeah this had to be like 16 or something somewhere in there."
"21488300","21489000"," 16, 17."
"21489620","21491460"," 2016, 17 somewhere in there. "
"21492380","21493540"," Maybe I've been 15 too."
"21498850","21500010"," Yeah I like the AMD."
"21510890","21514730"," Do we close for 10 today above or below or pinned?"
"21514730","21519030"," Above 59%, pin 22%, below 18%. "
"21526100","21527800"," We've got a 321."
"21528580","21530580"," Still have 40 minutes left until the close."
"21531120","21533700"," Man this turning into an eye bleeder day for me. "
"21534560","21535100"," I'm tired."
"21535560","21536560"," Are you guys tired or what?"
"21548550","21550170"," I'm thinking of it from the perspective."
"21550810","21554590"," Well I was like yeah. "
"21556250","21558250"," I was like that runs probably over."
"21558890","21559770"," Like all that COVID shit."
"21559930","21561490"," Now it's like Taiwan and China. "
"21561490","21563890"," And now it's like like Chegg."
"21565690","21567710"," Like Chegg just got taken out right."
"21568570","21569950"," It's like that's a no brainer trade. "
"21570190","21570850"," I missed that trade."
"21571250","21572490"," That was a no brainer."
"21574010","21576230"," Everybody knows that students are using it. "
"21577190","21579850"," Why would you need Chegg when you go to jet chat JPT?"
"21584780","21585740"," No brainer."
"21587020","21592200"," But on that same token with this whole AI trade bullshit."
"21592200","21595380"," You know like you know Elon is buying up. "
"21595380","21597760"," It's public now that Elon was buying up."
"21600920","21606340"," And video shit like like he's got like a what $250 million in orders."
"21607200","21609500"," You know AMD is going to be a part of that. "
"21611660","21615860"," So you get this like mad gold rush for computing power."
"21616340","21621080"," So like all the Bitcoin minor shit was like that went away kind of."
"21621740","21623180"," People at home kind of went away. "
"21623360","21627120"," But now all of a sudden you get Taiwan and you get chat JPT and open AI."
"21627480","21630200"," And like so you know that there are companies."
"21630500","21637780"," If I was a company that was threatened by AI. "
"21638300","21643620"," Let's think about this from the perspective of what's that shitty truck company that was a fraud."
"21644460","21644960"," Nikola."
"21647040","21649300"," So like all those fucks stir fraudsters. "
"21650740","21653020"," You know that there's going to be companies out there."
"21653720","21654840"," That are going to tell you."
"21655360","21659620"," Yeah we're like I don't check didn't do that but let's just say let's pretend it's a check. "
"21659900","21660760"," They're going to be like hey look man."
"21662360","21668220"," We bought a shit ton of processors for AI and we're in negotiations with some developers right now."

"22326830","22328310"," It's totally entertaining."
"22331250","22333430"," As bucks, they were cranking, man."
"22334410","22336330"," They were fucking cranking. "
"22343200","22344980"," Yeah, they're starting to top out."

"22352340","22353020"," Hold on, I'll show it to you. "
"22353360","22354520"," It's getting to that point."
"22359860","22361360"," Good call on Starbucks."
"22371190","22373730"," Dude, Starbucks is just vicious. "
"22380490","22382410"," I'm starting to get toppy on Starbucks."
"22382650","22383050"," See right here?"
"22384450","22385890"," Watch my cursor over here."
"22389410","22391950"," Let me see and change the color here so you can see it better. "
"22394210","22395950"," We'll do red or orange."
"22396270","22396330"," Ready?"
"22398010","22398510"," Just right there."
"22399570","22401250"," A little bit of pullback here. "
"22403910","22405030"," Same thing right here."
"22405610","22407910"," A little bit of pullback."
"22408350","22410190"," Continued pullback to the downside. "
"22411470","22412830"," Starting a little toppy up here."
"22415190","22416550"," I don't know if I'd short it."
"22417690","22419350"," Let's think about Starbucks, man. "
"22419650","22421310"," It's hard to short this shit."
"22422110","22423650"," It's still extremely bullish."
"22424430","22426310"," Like, we're trading above the monthly, the weekly, the daily. "
"22428030","22435790"," It's a little toppy here, but I'd be looking to buy a dip at 107.52. Possibly, possibly 102, but"
"22435790","22439210"," in all honesty, would not be shocked to see the dip get bought at 108."
"22440990","22442970"," You really want to see it break below."
"22443910","22445790"," This is where you start to see stuff. "
"22446290","22446970"," Well, not even that."
"22447670","22448910"," See the daily here?"
"22449710","22453210"," See how price went below the weekly, the daily, and the hourly?"
"22453510","22454110"," That's bearish."
"22454950","22457430"," Break below the monthly bearish. "
"22457530","22458870"," Like, that's where you see the big moves."
"22460750","22461950"," So, just over here."
"22462250","22463250"," Like, big, big, down moves. "
"22463970","22467990"," Right now, I can't say that Starbucks is done."
"22470350","22472750"," Maybe take profit, but I'd be careful of this."
"22473370","22475690"," You want to see price, like, get below the daily. "
"22476270","22480890"," You want to see the hourly follow it and price to be below both the hourly and the daily to"
"22480890","22481770"," start getting bearish."
"22481770","22487870"," I would say if you're long Starbucks, take the money and run."
"22488090","22493610"," Look for the next dip buy at 108.19. There's a lot of work that needs done for Starbucks to"
"22493610","22496210"," get, like, that blood bath shit that you're looking for. "
"22496870","22498010"," Some targets below."
"22499070","22504790"," 108 flat, and then 102.76, and 96.84 in Starbucks."
"22509960","22511960"," That's a good one to call out, by the way. "
"22523150","22526430"," Chase is saying he's shorted it on that cup and handle pump."
"22526730","22529610"," Switch to 410 puts it tomorrow in 410.405 for Thursday."
"22530890","22534550"," So, Chase doesn't believe in the, oh, I guess, yeah, 410.405 is not bad. "
"22535390","22541070"," Chase is being, actually placing some good trades."
"22542010","22543590"," He's not being, like, crazy bear."
"22543590","22549410"," Winky face to summarize AMD 95 to 102, CVS greater than 75 bucks. "
"22550130","22552110"," Starbucks 108, those are my thoughts."
"22552490","22555690"," Starbucks looks dumb at 221 levels again."
"22556670","22558390"," Chase is saying on weak consumer. "
"22558930","22561370"," Winky's saying they also charge eight bucks for coffee now."
"22564570","22565530"," Start the bear music."
"22569890","22572050"," AMD calls will have high implied vol. "
"22572410","22574230"," I would only buy the shares, not the options."
"22574910","22576050"," Yeah, like the idea of that too."
"22577910","22579170"," Hey, Sloth, how you doing, brother?"
"22580010","22580810"," Good to see you. "
"22583330","22584650"," Oh boy, you want to see it?"
"22584830","22587030"," Why don't you guys call out shit that's about to turn?"
"22587950","22592670"," You guys are always calling out shit that's like cranking face off."
"22596550","22598550"," It's, Nvidia's getting weaker."
"22603020","22603740"," I'll give you that. "
"22606260","22613880"," Retracement possibly to 268.98. 268.98 target below an Nvidia."
"22614900","22615780"," Still bullish."
"22616520","22618940"," Or it's topping. "
"22621220","22622960"," It's still topping."
"22624300","22626240"," Let me look at it on a bigger time frame."
"22626960","22627740"," Not a time frame, buddy. "
"22628760","22630140"," I have a secret sauce."
"22630140","22640490"," I have a secret sauce rollover chart I'll"
"22640490","22640970"," look at here."
"22647740","22648540"," Like a crash predictor. "
"22649840","22652700"," It works on tickers that are ready to start rolling."
"22654100","22655660"," Dude, oh man."
"22659710","22660930"," That's on sofai. "
"22661450","22663010"," I get the crash predictor on sofai."
"22664430","22665710"," I need to put it on."
"22667890","22668410"," Nvidia. "
"22671690","22677330"," So we're looking again now to the early market on close imbalance."
"22677330","22680710"," It is still sitting at 152 million to the south side."
"22681890","22684410"," You know, it's hard to say, man, like Nvidia. "
"22685190","22689230"," Yeah, it's like way over bottom on the quarterly."
"22690110","22691630"," The monthly, the weekly."
"22694390","22698030"," My only issue with Nvidia in tech in general. "
"22700370","22706100"," On these time frames is could the topping process and Nvidia take all summer?"
"22708270","22709210"," I'm serious."
"22711390","22716410"," We're coming into like a seasonality where tech outperforms once again."
"22719230","22725270"," So if you get a dip to buy, let's say in May for Nvidia, I would not be shocked to"
"22725270","22726610"," see it go higher for the summer. "
"22727650","22733290"," Like this probably buyable dips in Nvidia, but dude, when that shit does rollover, it's going to be"
"22733290","22734090"," fucking crazy."
"22734910","22739030"," If it's in September, October, then it roll like truly rolls over."
"22739290","22740130"," It's going to be epic. "
"22741530","22750150"," But I'm telling you, man, like these tech companies this summer will probably have buyable dips,"
"22750150","22754130"," which is insane to say."
"22755470","22762250"," I would expect on Nvidia, the deepest that you'll see this summer will be 22481."
"22763490","22765510"," If you're going to short this shit. "
"22767450","22770250"," As the weeks pass, that number comes up."
"22773540","22775740"," That 224 comes up every week."
"22776480","22777580"," Comes up $5. "
"22778660","22779880"," Every week."
"22784910","22785530"," 268."
"22787190","22788110"," You might get 225. "
"22789850","22790690"," So maybe next week 230."
"22791930","22795050"," In May, 232.35. 240 possible."
"22795390","22798230"," I wouldn't, I would do in the money shouldn't end video. "
"22811710","22819970"," I'd be really scared on like we're seasonally coming into another buying season on"
"22819970","22823350"," tech, believe it or not."
"22823490","22824670"," Now that sounds fucking crazy."
"22829120","22834760"," If you're a tech bull, you're just like begging for selling May. "
"22836540","22837840"," And price will matter."
"22838100","22845260"," Like if we don't get price, if we don't get price below 380 in May, I don't think that we"
"22845260","22845460"," do."
"22845880","22849700"," I think like if you see like spy 396, I'd be looking at the price of Nvidia. "
"22854430","22859330"," Matter of fact, just put it like a, put an alert, like ask Captain Jim James."
"22859810","22864870"," If spy hits 396, ask Captain Jim James, what he thinks about Nvidia then."
"22864870","22874730"," Like anytime in the month of May, trading 410.88, 410.85"
"22874730","22874950"," here. "
"22875930","22879970"," We've got, fuck, we still have 17 minutes left."
"22881170","22882310"," It's a dragon ass."
"22889070","22899450"," Yeah, there's like, there's, um, there's,"
"22901950","22912110"," there are numbers showing up into end of summer like, you know, we have, we have, we"
"22912110","22912910"," know we have selling May. "
"22913790","22916350"," You know that we have volatility with the debt ceiling."
"22917170","22921590"," You know that we have usually the fall is like fucking sell it."
"22922970","22924150"," Sell the hell out of it. "
"22924210","22924470"," Like, right?"
"22924650","22926890"," Like September, October, we're selling the shit out of the market."
"22929290","22939000"," Um, I'd, right now I'd be weary or not weary, just"
"22939000","22939600"," measured."
"22941380","22944480"," Like in those, on those known vol events that we have. "

"24286980","24289400"," Not much happening on spy after hours."
"24289580","24295200"," That point 0.02%. I'm sticking around here to see if we can get AMD to release at least the"

"24390320","24394220"," Remember when he used to drop the Intel earnings like the day before?"
"24395720","24396520"," Like a day."
"24396860","24400160"," Remember when that shit would happen that like Intel would be like yeah we're going to drop the"

"24412010","24415230"," Yeah Starbucks chart looked like it was still overbought. "
"24417470","24421250"," It makes me wonder if even with those good earnings if they're going to sell it."
"24423450","24425710"," I'm not getting a reaction right now on AMD."

"24478910","24484030"," I just want to see I want to see him do this big giant green bar up and I want"
