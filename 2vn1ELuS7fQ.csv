"2500","3640"," Check one, two, check."
"4940","6060"," Mike, check."
"15660","17360"," Mike, check, melt up week. "
"18560","22480"," Oh boy, here we go."
"29100","31320"," Good morning."
"50060","51140"," Check one. "
"53540","57480"," It's got a fine day of taking money on the opening bell."
"59420","68650"," It was asked in a post on Twitter this morning to"
"68650","73810"," take the money and run."
"74190","75110"," We're going to discuss. "
"76010","79250"," Seems like every month or so we have to re-discuss this for people."
"79250","82690"," So we should, baby."
"94600","95940"," Allow all comments. "
"97520","98760"," Sort by newest."
"103210","104010"," Describe us."
"104850","105470"," Hey, duration. "
"107050","107650"," Save."
"109730","110650"," Morning out there."
"110750","111510"," How y'all doing out there?"
"111610","111890"," It's morning. "
"111890","117040"," Coming right along."
"121560","122600"," Close that up."
"122680","124040"," Let everybody pile up in here. "
"146660","147780"," Get right into it."
"148900","152360"," Okay, so we've got some talking to do this morning right off the bell."
"155000","157480"," Spiced PX is yes. "
"157840","159920"," We got two twos."
"161940","164120"," Maple some Tesla talk."
"165900","166660"," Thursday. "
"168060","168800"," Finish strong."
"169680","171840"," Finish the corner strong."
"173080","175820"," Melt up in progress this morning. "
"178870","185510"," Melt up in progress as of, you know, it gets been melting up for some time now, right?"
"186010","190730"," Now, I made a post this morning where I said, take the money and run."
"191050","192610"," So this is, I haven't changed anything from yesterday."
"193710","196570"," So I just want to show you a few things right off the get that we're at the get go"
"196570","196970"," this morning. "
"200690","201850"," There's a few things I want to say."
"201970","203210"," This is the five minute try right here."
"203830","207390"," You can see all retests of the five that met with Burr, right?"
"209010","210370"," We want to talk about. "
"211690","216870"," Well, right now, just off the opening bell as long as price stays above the five minute one, the"
"216870","217690"," five minute one minute."
"219050","219690"," Line."
"220750","223930"," You're good to go for a move higher. "
"224530","234470"," Now, with that said, when you trade zero, zero dates, one"
"234470","236410"," dates, any of that kind of stuff."
"236410","242490"," Now, oftentimes, I had a clean clip, some of these old price targets that you wanted to hit."
"244920","246760"," Don't worry, we've got higher price targets here. "
"251470","254450"," We've done all of these here, done all of these here."
"256870","261890"," Now, what I want to talk to you about this morning, though, that is important to you as a trader."
"262850","263750"," Now, most of you know this. "
"264570","266530"," Some of you have not been here."
"267190","267630"," Pile on it."
"267770","268250"," Good morning, everybody. "
"268550","269050"," How's everybody doing?"
"270230","272450"," We've got a big old giant gap down here to fill."
"272710","274950"," Look at how much much Burr we've got this morning."
"276390","281330"," You'll oftentimes hear people say to you booking profit. "
"281910","283470"," You should always book profit when you can."
"284730","291530"," I saw some people in Finto this morning say, no, we should continue trend to stay long on those one"
"291530","293170"," dates that are now zero dates today."
"293170","297130"," I want to talk to you about that because some of you know this, but some of you don't. "
"299810","301490"," And I always find it fast."
"301750","308860"," One of the reasons I always find it fascinating is because for this answer, what I find fascinating"
"308860","317670"," is zero dates and one date and in this market,"
"317690","327690"," in this specific market, this past year or so, maybe two years, there has been a"
"327690","328990"," lot of liquidity in the market."
"329330","332610"," So, there's not a lot of room for you to be wrong. "
"333050","334870"," This is even for bears too on the downside."
"335270","336470"," There's not a lot of room often."
"336710","344170"," You'll notice that when you're in a bear market or a sideways market or a market with low"
"344170","351370"," liquidity, that you're not, there isn't a padding for making a wrong mistake. "
"352330","356770"," So, a bull market, when there's lots of liquidity, make a mistake, the liquidity is going to come"
"356770","361700"," in and help you for being sloppy."
"363020","370780"," But not only that, due to the nature of a zero, a one date or a weekly in this market,"
"370980","371760"," we have wild swings."
"371760","381300"," And you're usually directionally going to get paid the most money in a directional move. "
"382380","386920"," You'll notice sometimes you'll buy a one date a weekly and you'll see, let's say price starts at a"
"386920","387360"," dollar."
"389140","390380"," You'll see it over time."
"390740","392680"," It'll go watch my cursor right here. "
"392740","392960"," It'll go."
"393220","397080"," It'll go $1 to $1.50 down to 90 cents."
"398020","398420"," Right?"
"398740","403320"," Maybe up to $1.60 down to 80 cents, right?"
"403860","408340"," $1.30, $0.70 as you move up, right?"
"409440","413920"," So, if you are that trader that's like, if you are that trader that's like, well, well, first of"
"413920","414920"," all, if you're in trend day. "
"416640","420420"," Yeah, if you just held the entire day, you'd probably make some pretty decent money."
"420420","427240"," But if you're that good, you can more than likely buy that zero day once, twice, three times, four"
"427240","427640"," times."
"428720","436120"," And oftentimes, nine out of 10 times, nine out of 10 times, you probably did not time your entry"
"436120","436900"," proper. "
"437220","438500"," You're probably timed it up here."
"439260","444380"," And so you're constantly trying to chase the entire way up while being met with theta burn."
"447200","453040"," Normally, nine out of 10 times, I bet one of the mechanics that you're using into enter these"
"453040","453320"," trades. "
"454100","457760"," You've you fucked up one of the things like I fucked up my entry."
"457880","458780"," I fucked up my timing."
"459040","460040"," I held too long. "
"460740","463220"," The move directionally went against me eventually."
"463880","465580"," You get caught and trapped at some point."
"466120","468680"," And then you get caught trapped also by by Greeks. "
"473180","477980"," Now, if you're trading, if you're hearing like call spreads over a course week, that's different."
"478580","483320"," If you're in a higher timeframe, like, oh, I bought a month out calls, that's different."
"484400","490920"," So when you're trading zero in one day, and often this week, we have one more day left. "
"491260","495440"," So there ain't no fucking weeklies that are going to be on your side."
"497200","498280"," Holding for this."
"498500","500020"," My point here is multi fold. "
"501740","506200"," So if you took this trade with me in the clothes yesterday, these calls and the clothes yesterday"
"506200","506760"," with me."
"507500","512159"," You're making a bet that this is going up significantly on this open."
"512840","519580"," And then when you come into this market today, this morning at nine 30, you are now making a new"
"519580","519860"," bet. "
"520700","521039"," You understand?"
"522799","528340"," So if you take that money off the table, let's say you place this bed of clothes, boom, I made"
"528340","529280"," a bed of clothes."
"529760","533280"," You wake up and it's going your way, right?"
"533960","539240"," You take the money off the table and things change overnight with zero dates and one day."
"539320","540520"," It's all kinds of shit changes. "
"541160","541960"," So you don't know."
"542020","544780"," You don't know where you're going to open where you're going to continue on if you're going to gap"
"544780","545360"," up or whatever."
"545600","549540"," You take that money and you then renegotiate a new bet. "
"550440","554280"," And so just right now off of this open, you're renegotiating."
"555040","557180"," Are we going to gap up or we're going to squeeze my trades."
"557180","558120"," I was going to consolidate. "
"558580","559620"," Are we going to delta hedge?"
"560080","562180"," You don't know what's going to happen here, right?"
"562280","562660"," At this point."
"563300","565580"," So you have to renegotiate that trade on open."
"568020","573340"," You should be booking profit on zero one dates and weeklies when it goes in the direction you want"
"573340","573960"," it to go in. "
"574580","577320"," Book profits renegotiate that trade."
"578240","582760"," If you're a one month call or put, no big deal spreads, no big deal."
"583680","589360"," But if you're out there trying, if you're out there trying to trade hard and fast, I take the"
"589360","590060"," direction right. "
"590200","591420"," I take the timing right."
"592020","593560"," I hit my price target."
"593920","595480"," You take the fucking money and run. "
"599260","601780"," You can sometimes leave runners on if you want."
"604080","607920"," You can do whatever you want, but I'm telling you to be book profits on these trades."
"608300","612060"," You're in this for such a, it's directionally in your favor. "
"612560","614000"," If you're that good, time it right."
"614000","615640"," Pick the direction right."
"616060","619060"," Pick the buy-in, the sell right. "
"619560","620640"," You're a fucking pro."
"621460","623600"," And when you're a pro like that, you know to book profit."
"624280","626940"," Because if you held too long, you know that it turns against you. "
"627360","632600"," You're talking about going 100, 200, 300% in profit to fucking zero."
"633700","634780"," And a matter of moments."
"635780","637340"," You can see premium drop out. "
"637560","639220"," There's all kinds of shit that can happen to you."
"640600","642660"," But it's a new bet is my point to you."
"642660","643820"," You're now making a new bet. "
"643840","644640"," Are we going up?"
"645820","647040"," How high are we going?"
"647460","648460"," Are we going to consolidate?"
"648860","650400"," Are we going to close this gap down below?"
"650560","651480"," We're going to close this gap."
"651560","652460"," We'll talk about gaps too."
"653120","654960"," We've got trap shorts right here, right?"
"655600","657740"," This morning, another round of trap shorts. "
"658300","660140"," Trap shorts down here now."
"661140","665240"," I don't know if you have any more that I can see right now, but just those two groups right"
"665240","666620"," here here and here."
"667780","670680"," We call these guys zombie bulls. "
"671420","674060"," These are bears that are not trapped for us to go higher."
"675340","676940"," What else did I tell you yesterday?"
"677080","679260"," I said to you, if we close this gap."
"681140","683900"," Structurally, we'll be better off to go higher. "
"684800","686640"," If we leave this gap behind."
"688060","692580"," We can still go higher in Friday, but we're not structurally sound."
"693440","699320"," We don't always come back to fill gaps, but we oftentimes do, especially in this market. "
"699320","702700"," This market has become very efficient."
"703300","709020"," No liquidity and trying to erase a lot of the shit that took place in the COVID bull run."
"711200","715720"," You'll notice if you start looking at individual tickers, ETFs, doesn't matter. "
"716640","723280"," This specific year in last year, mostly, we have cleaned up gaps all over the fucking place up"
"723280","723640"," down."
"724400","726220"," We don't leave that many gaps right now."
"728200","730740"," Low liquidity, highly efficient market right now. "
"731020","733500"," We don't often leave these gaps and you see that we are."
"737980","740960"," We are sitting on top of this next price target, right?"
"741760","742540"," Trade it above it."
"743220","745600"," Now consolidating for it for a move higher. "
"746260","749580"," As long as we stay above the one minute, you renegotiate the trade."
"750080","754680"," If you're bullish here, you renegotiate that trade with a target above."
"754680","758720"," But always book profits on zero. "
"758980","761400"," One day is statistically probability speaking."
"761740","763820"," You're going to get torched enough."
"764200","765340"," And then here's the other part. "
"767100","770400"," If I buy is, let's say, let's say I buy a zero date down here."
"770720","772420"," This is the biggest part."
"773240","775200"," If I buy a zero date right here. "
"776260","776340"," Right?"
"777080","777600"," 40148."
"777900","778580"," I buy a 404."
"780080","780160"," Right?"
"782020","784220"," I bought this 404 back here. "
"784880","788000"," I should be booking profit to change, take the money."
"789240","789320"," Right?"
"789560","795140"," And then I look for cheaper one or zero dates right here for the next target higher."
"795580","796140"," Does that make sense?"
"796880","798340"," That's where I'll be like, Hey, I'm going to take all this money. "
"798980","801620"," We put in 10 grand boom."
"801620","802960"," I just made $30,000."
"803780","804260"," Okay. "
"804280","806660"," I'm going to take another 10 grand or five grand."
"807040","808540"," This is a riskier bet here."
"809200","809620"," Right?"
"809800","811180"," And I'm going to buy cheaper options. "
"812000","817400"," I'm not going to stay in an option that went from $1 to $3."
"818560","819580"," I'll be like, fuck it."
"819660","821060"," I'm just going to ride $3 options. "
"821220","821880"," They're going to 12."
"822940","823360"," Right?"
"823520","826820"," I'm going to buy 50 cents, 25 cents."
"827740","830200"," Something that's something that I can get some premium kick. "
"830380","834880"," If anybody jumps on them later on, there's all kinds of like mechanics in the background why you"
"834880","835700"," should take the money run."
"836180","839160"," Take the money run and renegotiate that trade higher."
"839160","845630"," If you think that's where we're going, especially on zero or one dates. "
"846410","848190"," If none of you have ever been there."
"848950","850290"," I have fucking been there."
"850470","851530"," I've fucking I've been there. "
"851730","853770"," We're like, got like a 25 cent option."
"853910","854610"," It just runs up."
"855050","856370"," Two, three, four dollars. "
"857050","857890"," Wake up the next morning."
"858570","858930"," Ten cents."
"860050","861470"," It's like what they do. "
"862550","863730"," They should have booked profit."
"865090","867710"," Re-entered a trade at a cheaper price."
"867710","871090"," If I buy a 30 cent option, it goes to fucking 10 cents. "
"871670","872190"," Five cents."
"872390","872890"," That's so bad."
"873650","877050"," If I have a three, four dollar option, it goes down to 10 cents. "
"877490","879590"," You know, you know, you see this a lot of times we get really hurt."
"880470","880570"," Tesla."
"881750","883330"," Tesla, you can have like a dollar option. "
"883470","884110"," Go to 30 bucks."
"884750","885470"," You used to be able to."
"885730","888850"," I mean, like all the time you have like a dollar, two dollars, three dollar option. "
"889390","891210"," Go like 10, 15, 20, 30."
"891210","893370"," The same kind of thing on a different scale."
"893990","897470"," But the volatility of that option, you can see a $20 option. "
"897550","898430"," Go to $1, right?"
"898990","901930"," They didn't get really torch in these trades."
"902030","902570"," This is my point."
"902710","905250"," You can get killed in these options. "
"905890","908490"," So if you're going to make that bet right now, so think about this."
"908610","910450"," You got to get a dollar option."
"910630","911450"," That's now three dollars. "
"912430","917390"," Then you're trying to trade the spy on a zero day going here."
"917390","922970"," And much rather by a 10 cent or 30 cent option, 50 cent option."
"923810","927570"," And just scrape all that, that one dollar to three dollars. "
"927670","930390"," Take that two dollars away and then go back in with less money."
"931010","932770"," A lot of you guys lose money."
"932910","935550"," You're like, well, I bought an option for 10 cents and went to a dollar. "
"936230","939150"," I'm going to diamond hand it until I make five dollars."
"939790","942990"," Or I'm going to double down or I'm going to stay in it."
"943610","945110"," That does sometimes work. "
"945110","950090"," But if you're going to do that and use that good, then you might even on a trend day, you"
"950090","951230"," might as well take each trip."
"951910","953330"," You like, take the rip reset."
"953550","954430"," Take the rip reset. "
"954670","955450"," Take the rip reset."
"955730","956310"," Take the rip reset."
"956550","957690"," You actually max even higher. "
"958610","960990"," You'll make even more gains than if you just held all day long."
"961590","963070"," I guess that's what the rest of my point is."
"963810","965730"," If you're really trying to make that much money. "
"966610","970710"," If you're that much of a rock star all star, you can jump in and out, in and out, in"
"970710","971010"," and out."
"971130","974490"," You've seen us in the program, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out, in and"
"974490","974630"," out."
"975330","976290"," Does that make sense?"
"979820","985340"," Sometimes in these, like right now, at this moment, sometimes, if you're, if you're a, if you're a"
"985340","987300"," long time day trader on zero dates. "
"988280","989520"," Not so much an SPX, but spy."
"990820","993080"," You'll even see, you'll even see us."
"993800","997940"," The re pricing of options, even though we're going up right now, trying to crank on this. "
"999160","1001560"," So you renegotiate your price, right?"
"1001780","1002640"," Take the money and run here."
"1002640","1006880"," You rebuy an option down here, right?"
"1007060","1009040"," A cheaper option, right?"
"1009160","1011120"," And you have a price target above that you want to go to."
"1012100","1012820"," Make sense?"
"1017360","1019640"," Now trading four, zero, four, thirty four. "
"1021600","1026280"," Trading above the one minute here, bullish above this line right here."
"1032619","1037440"," I'm going to start giving you your, your, your support and resistance here, hang tight here."
"1037579","1038480"," No, no, I don't want an update. "
"1038700","1038880"," Hold on."
"1038880","1041640"," I don't want an update."
"1043540","1045319"," No updates for me right now. "
"1046560","1047380"," No updates."
"1047620","1048020"," I'm on a rant."
"1048220","1056300"," So just so you know, take the money and run, renegotiate the trade once more book profit. "
"1059890","1061370"," Key, key points."
"1061630","1062850"," And you can, you can point."
"1063610","1065890"," You know, you have a, we have a."
"1067030","1067650"," Antidodal evidence. "
"1068330","1070930"," You could say in one moment, well, hey, look cap today."
"1070950","1073590"," I would have made a million dollars instead of 30 grand."
"1074410","1076130"," That is antidote at evidence. "
"1076350","1079030"," If you trade this stuff day, I've been trading this shit for years."
"1079530","1083910"," Day in, day out, day in, day out, day in, day out."
"1084910","1087890"," Statistically speaking, you're going to blow, blow the shit out of your accounts. "
"1088810","1090090"," If you're wild ass and that's it."
"1090370","1094070"," And if someone out there is telling you to do that anywhere in social media."
"1094930","1099230"," I promise you 90% of those people are trading a weekly paycheck. "
"1100150","1101310"," I'm telling that's what they do."
"1101490","1102610"," They like go to work all week long."
"1103090","1104710"," They get a check from Wendy's on Friday. "
"1105210","1106010"," I mean, let it ride."
"1108550","1112270"," I assure you, you quickest way to back to zero is do it pull on that bullshit."
"1112970","1113610"," Take profit. "
"1115450","1120990"," And if you're, if you want those people that don't set stop losses, you can take 10 cuts to get"
"1120990","1122110"," 1, 300% trade."
"1122590","1126350"," If you're a wild person that doesn't set stop limits, you should always at least have your trigger"
"1126350","1129350"," to take the other side of the trade or slam a stop limit."
"1129910","1135050"," As a matter of fact, most of you have seen me lose, most of my losing trades here on this"
"1135050","1138250"," program is when I fucking don't have a stop. "
"1139850","1142970"," Most of the time, most of the time when you see me have to take the other side of the"
"1142970","1144650"," trade, don't have a stop."
"1151970","1154050"," Now that we're talking different things here."
"1154110","1156990"," If you're owning stock, you have a stop limit that's lower. "
"1156990","1162130"," If you're trading a monthly, any kind of other structured trade, if you're trading the spreads on"
"1162130","1163830"," SPX are smaller, right?"
"1164270","1167490"," Less volatility on SPX, less volatility on ES."
"1167870","1171590"," But if you're trading zero dates buys, these are fucking hard and fast rules."
"1173290","1176010"," Hard and fast, rarely to be broken. "
"1176230","1176830"," Sometimes you can."
"1177190","1178230"," You'll see me break them sometimes."
"1178550","1179230"," I'll just add to position. "
"1179430","1180090"," I'll believe in my position."
"1180390","1181270"," I'll be upside down to my position."
"1181950","1183070"," There are times to do all that shit. "
"1183070","1187550"," If a position opens lower than you expect it to open, you're losing money."
"1187830","1189070"," If you add to it then reset."
"1190390","1194170"," I mean, there are other mechanics to this part of this trade. "
"1195510","1202150"," If a trade goes in your direction like this over this time, take the money and fucking run."
"1203290","1207910"," I'd rather place a dollar a day before, make three or four bucks, make another trade for 30 cents"
"1207910","1209910"," if it goes wrong, right off that bell."
"1209910","1211830"," What do I lose, 30 cents?"
"1212290","1213430"," I'm fucking still banked the day. "
"1214250","1214910"," Fucking stoked."
"1217150","1217990"," I'm stoked."
"1221620","1226000"," It's like going to a casino table and being like, here's a thousand bucks. "
"1226220","1227020"," I just made a million."
"1227180","1227820"," Let's ride."
"1228060","1230020"," Let's let the whole million ride once more. "
"1230640","1231640"," It's pure insanity."
"1237080","1238680"," That's basically what you're doing, right?"
"1239960","1243320"," If you're going to do that, there are easier ways to do that."
"1243320","1245660"," Or there are more profitable ways to do that. "
"1246380","1248720"," I know some of you are like, well, I'm trying to build an account."
"1250180","1257740"," There are way, way, way safer ways to place 10 trades that are going to build your account and"
"1257740","1259260"," print you 100% every time."
"1259980","1263140"," Then zero dates, one dates, weeklies, any of that shit. "
"1264920","1271680"," Even that, even that argument, there's better trades than a zero data weekly or a one date."
"1273320","1275600"," There's no real argument to where you win it when this."
"1275860","1276300"," I don't think. "
"1276660","1277540"," Well, I guess you win it."
"1278040","1278780"," You know how you win it?"
"1279040","1280420"," You go the fuck back to work tomorrow."
"1281620","1283820"," You go back and you take your fucking job again. "
"1285020","1286900"," And you have to work a job."
"1291060","1292580"," You know, that's pretty much it, right?"
"1293240","1298340"," Because ultimately, you're the only person you can scream at me or yourself or whoever you want."
"1299240","1301780"," But ultimately, you end up paying that price. "
"1302400","1308020"," Ultimately, at the end of the day, all the shit talking that you see out there, you wind up being"
"1308020","1309840"," the one that has to eat that shit burger."
"1313210","1315670"," You know, we can brag to whatever we want to do."
"1315910","1319430"," But the truth is, you're the one that's going to have to live with that decision. "
"1320650","1321730"," 39, 49, 49."
"1322570","1326990"," You know, I'm not going to come here on a live stream and be like, you should, you know, pay"
"1326990","1332550"," heed to these rules that I live by because they have served me badly or something."
"1334190","1336650"," You know, here we go. "
"1336890","1337930"," There's S1 right there."
"1338550","1339730"," There's your pivot 4055."
"1340890","1343170"," 39, 949 is S1 down here. "
"1345390","1346670"," Feels good to book profit."
"1347010","1347270"," Trust me."
"1347950","1348950"," It's a good feeling. "
"1348950","1350110"," It feels really good."
"1352730","1354270"," S2, 39, 762."
"1356110","1357990"," And then you've got the 39, 762. "
"1358410","1361070"," You know, I was talking to a guy the other day and he was like, why do you come on"
"1361070","1361750"," late some mornings?"
"1361750","1365570"," And I was like, it's because I want the market to open up for these people."
"1367290","1368170"," 39, 657."
"1371540","1372160"," There you go. "
"1372220","1372920"," That's three right here."
"1373840","1374820"," That's two down here."
"1375140","1375540"," A little gap. "
"1375700","1376460"," It's the fill down here."
"1376760","1378420"," Leaving behind all kinds of gaps."
"1380000","1380440"," Right. "
"1380540","1384120"," I want the market to open oftentimes for traders."
"1384360","1385240"," I don't want them to."
"1389670","1390470"," There you go. "
"1390630","1391150"," The R2."
"1391330","1392190"," We got R1."
"1392510","1392930"," Hold on. "
"1393090","1393330"," Hold on."
"1394890","1396190"," R2, R3, R1."
"1396730","1398030"," Trading low right now. "
"1398750","1399910"," You see it right here, right?"
"1400170","1401450"," Trading below 40376."
"1402270","1403170"," Trapping some bulls."
"1407100","1409420"," R1, 40241. "
"1418100","1419260"," Get rid of that now."
"1424370","1427010"," Let's see where the options market is priced today."
"1428850","1429490"," R2. "
"1429790","1431070"," It's 40346."
"1436310","1437530"," Right there."
"1445170","1445810"," R3. "
"1450330","1452110"," 40533, baby."
"1452350","1452590"," Whoo."
"1452870","1453310"," Right there. "
"1457690","1464670"," If you're not a trader, if you're a paper trader, days like today, if you were paper trading"
"1464670","1468770"," yesterday, you should be watching the mechanics of the options chain on one date."
"1469550","1470430"," On zero dates."
"1470430","1472530"," On two dates we have left this week. "
"1473030","1479430"," And just watch the rise and fall option pricing."
"1479670","1481870"," If I can do this this morning, I will."
"1483610","1486630"," But if I can't, I don't know if I can. "
"1486830","1488090"," I don't think I have to turn off."
"1488930","1494030"," That's to make another instance of not tasty of think or swim."
"1494730","1496330"," I'm going to explain something else. "
"1496330","1497350"," It's kind of cool to you."
"1497850","1501050"," I used to use this frequently, but I don't use as much as I should."
"1501210","1502710"," And I wanted to reintroduce it. "
"1503010","1504830"," I want to introduce it in the show."
"1507990","1509450"," I'm going to do this for you."
"1510510","1511570"," Hang tight here, guys. "
"1520980","1521740"," All right."
"1523800","1525280"," So we have hourly."
"1525280","1529860"," Early support is at $3.99 80. "
"1535380","1539640"," $3.99 way down here $3.99 80."
"1542840","1544140"," That's your hourly trigger."
"1545040","1546320"," This is where real support is. "
"1548180","1549960"," So a real trend buying."
"1550220","1551820"," If you're like, I want to buy into this."
"1552000","1552580"," It's down here. "
"1553280","1554940"," So the smart money is down here."
"1558840","1561300"," This is FOMO money up here."
"1561860","1563740"," Smart money entry down here. "
"1571160","1574260"," $3.97 10."
"1577060","1579720"," This is where the really smart money is down here."
"1580660","1582580"," It's where your daily trend is right here. "
"1582700","1583200"," Your daily trigger."
"1584260","1586180"," Daily trend way down here."
"1587540","1588440"," Smart money. "
"1590220","1591520"," Wrinkle brain money."
"1591940","1592360"," Smooth brain."

"1599000","1602180"," Hooking profit smart and wrinkle brain right here."
"1603900","1604680"," Make sense?"
"1616630","1617670"," Right here."
"1617930","1619090"," Here's your weekly trigger. "
"1621630","1622970"," Here's your monthly trigger."
"1639300","1640080"," All right."
"1640140","1640480"," Not bad. "
"1640680","1640920"," Not bad."
"1641840","1644480"," Get rid of that at each line right there."
"1644660","1648360"," Clean some of this up so you can have a nice clean chart for yourself this morning. "
"1649560","1650380"," And what I want."
"1650460","1652820"," What I do want to talk to you about here is this is."
"1655100","1658600"," Got a one minute cross below prices below the one minute. "
"1658700","1663380"," That's bearish right on a five minute chart price below the one minute is bearish."
"1666120","1671340"," Confirmation of that would be a rejection and then a trade below with a target at four or two fifty"
"1671340","1671720"," five."
"1672200","1676000"," And we have this area down here to fill if we do if we even do fill it. "
"1676000","1677760"," On a one minute chart."
"1678840","1680060"," We have a bearish cross."
"1681660","1682960"," You see it right here. "
"1691670","1692910"," Barrow plane right."
"1694670","1700490"," Now 10 12 a.m. They just need a new low."
"1701590","1702790"," By 10 15. "
"1703310","1704430"," They kind of tagged it right."
"1704630","1704830"," They tagged."
"1704830","1707410"," Tagged our two already. "
"1707830","1708330"," Ting."
"1710790","1711290"," Right."
"1711410","1712590"," So I actually don't need the 12 50. "
"1712850","1714190"," Oh, there we go."
"1714330","1715570"," Hello ladies."
"1716150","1716970"," There goes your. "
"1717130","1719390"," Here's your 10 15 new low."
"1721590","1722090"," Damn."
"1722630","1723670"," How does that feel?"
"1724190","1724750"," Does that hurt?"
"1729810","1731550"," That hurt feel that one. "
"1732810","1733790"," Did you feel that?"
"1734030","1735190"," Did you feel good taking profit?"
"1736850","1740150"," Did you feel good?"
"1740430","1740970"," Oh, wait a minute."
"1741450","1741870"," Hold on."
"1742030","1742950"," Watch this one right here. "
"1743510","1744250"," Fucking files."
"1744530","1746610"," Pre registration undertaking in Canada."
"1749090","1752170"," We got another one right about here. "
"1752290","1754310"," This is where the gap began actually right here."
"1755610","1757090"," Actually see it right there."
"1757090","1763570"," Oh, that feel. "
"1764730","1766710"," You get slapped in the face on that one."
"1766890","1768690"," You got beer beer rage this morning."
"1768950","1769610"," Well, not only that. "
"1769690","1770290"," I want to say something."
"1770810","1771770"," See this right here."
"1772470","1776110"," I was trying to explain this yesterday and I had a hard time explaining it, but. "
"1776710","1779850"," And I made a comment on I think it was cheddar flow made a comment that."
"1780250","1781930"," They had said the JPM caller."
"1782210","1784090"," They said the JPM caller is offset. "
"1785390","1788250"," They said they made a great point and they got great data."
"1788250","1790550"," They were like JPM caller."
"1791450","1794810"," Is offset by JPM buying zero date calls. "
"1796070","1797650"," To not disrupt the market."
"1799310","1801110"," Yeah, with these large trades."
"1801770","1808030"," And I was like, yes, JPM does do that heading into E.O.C. E.O.C. E.O.M."
"1808030","1808270"," right. "
"1808810","1809970"," I was like, they do do that."
"1810590","1816410"," I was like, but there are many, many, many hedges that come in this market heading into end of"
"1816410","1816970"," quarter in a month."
"1817990","1819890"," That are not hedged with call. "
"1820510","1824410"," They're not hedged with with zero day calls in their favor."
"1825470","1828830"," And you do oftentimes have a brief moment."
"1830770","1832650"," Before it impacts the market. "
"1834830","1837890"," You'll get like a 20 seconds to one minute."
"1838010","1839310"," You did a great job of this too."
"1839370","1840830"," I'm going to give a shout out to. "
"1841650","1844510"," Flow Algo of all the flow services out there."
"1844510","1846550"," Flow Algo is the best."
"1847630","1849630"," The best flow service. "
"1850390","1852850"," For only picking the choices."
"1854390","1855350"," Of unusual flow."
"1856030","1859150"," And they shine during a month and a quarter. "
"1860710","1864490"," Days because you will see like you will see like a."
"1865210","1870490"," Twenty million dollars and puts or hundred million dollars and puts hit the market hit the tape"
"1870490","1872170"," without call flow."
"1872170","1878390"," And like seconds later, you'll see boom, the market drops briefly out from underneath you."
"1879250","1880630"," Like like like boom. "
"1881410","1881870"," Right."
"1882390","1884830"," That's probably a part of this action right here."
"1885310","1887170"," And double wide cap or. "
"1888470","1889410"," I think it was double."
"1889690","1894430"," I don't feel who it was that said it this morning, but one of my friends on Finto it said"
"1894430","1897670"," something like I feel how he described it."
"1898490","1900290"," But but I was like it's like a bumpy road. "
"1900290","1901790"," I was like these last couple days."
"1902150","1906730"," You're just sitting there going along and all of a sudden the floor drops out and it comes back up"
"1906730","1910490"," and the floor drops out and it comes back up and floor drops out on you."
"1911950","1913510"," So you'll you'll see this action. "
"1913790","1914990"," You'll see a little bit of it today."
"1915110","1916250"," You'll see more of it tomorrow."
"1923120","1925300"," It was kind of funny to watch that right down there. "
"1926260","1928740"," Selling into strength with size."
"1931660","1933380"," Well, some of it's selling in a strength size."
"1933380","1935920"," Some of it's market positioning for the quarter for the next quarter. "
"1940440","1941320"," So there you go."
"1941440","1941820"," Right down there."
"1941880","1942560"," That blood bath. "
"1943060","1943400"," Baby."
"1945020","1946740"," Is this easy for a bear?"
"1947000","1947140"," No."
"1948040","1948280"," This can. "
"1948700","1954500"," So you have the initial reaction of someone placing a large bid or a large, a large bet, right?"
"1954740","1955600"," A bit of size."
"1956060","1958560"," And then oftentimes 20 minutes later."
"1959700","1962160"," You'll see dealers take the opposite side of that trade. "
"1963120","1964440"," They will hedge that trade."
"1964440","1966300"," It'll swing back on the high again."
"1967020","1968060"," Very violent moves. "
"1969440","1975020"," I guess I want to describe it like driving down a dirt road and it after a rainstorm."
"1975500","1978840"," Then you see puddles, but you don't know how deep the craters are."
"1979420","1982040"," So you know, you used to be driving all the sudden and be like, wait, I'm going to be like,"
"1982220","1982700"," Oh, shit. "
"1982860","1983280"," What was that?"
"1988700","1990640"," We'll talk about some other functions here."
"1990880","1992660"," A lot of people like trying to blame shit."
"1992780","1995200"," They're like, like it's a layered cake. "
"1995200","1995680"," It's more."
"1995900","1998620"," It's like someone else said something about like dressing window dressing."
"1998920","1999840"," I was like, yeah, that's part of that. "
"2000160","2001460"," There's some window dressing."
"2001720","2003060"," There's some mark to market stuff."
"2003340","2004700"," MTM stuff that goes on. "
"2005820","2011760"," There's so many mechanics in the background in these days that you can assign them to many"
"2011760","2012540"," different things, right?"
"2013180","2014760"," And that's part of the title this morning."
"2015260","2021860"," Or at least the picture of this video says, you know, reprice the VIX question mark."
"2022260","2025980"," It's very much a clickbait to some extent. "
"2027280","2028920"," Is do we reprice the VIX?"
"2029260","2031680"," Are we in a new bull market where the VIX needs to get out?"
"2031800","2032960"," It's possible that happens."
"2033480","2034260"," It's possible."
"2035320","2039020"," We're going to address what we're going to address what Parena Peru said as well. "
"2040360","2047139"," People were saying was Peru being honest was serious that we're going to see weeks of bullishness."
"2048100","2048739"," Or not."
"2048840","2052060"," We'll take a look at something that says it kind of backs up what he says. "
"2053520","2057820"," And then we have other people out there that are saying, no, we're going to fucking tee off right"
"2057820","2058280"," on Friday."
"2058739","2059120"," 414."
"2060120","2060760"," 414 PM. "
"2061800","2062980"," Market's going to burn, right?"
"2063139","2066699"," You're going to wake up Monday morning and it's going to be like a baseball bat across your neck."
"2066860","2069840"," 100 signaling neutral and the crypto fear and greed index."
"2070420","2072179"," 60F 100 signaling greed. "
"2072580","2074179"," So we're going to look at both of those things today."
"2075480","2077120"," We're going to look at what Peru is saying."
"2077460","2079260"," We're going to see why Peru is saying that. "
"2079420","2082239"," We're going to see if Peru is saying that to just game the market."
"2085000","2085840"," We'll find out."
"2086659","2090600"," I don't know if you explained himself, but I'm going to show something that kind of backs up what"
"2090600","2090960"," he's saying. "
"2092500","2093900"," Kind of backs up what he's saying."
"2094239","2103820"," And we're going to look at some real simple ways for you to see in the next quarter overall"
"2103820","2108560"," trend, some key numbers that you can actually set alerts on and say, yeah, we can't go below this"
"2108560","2108820"," number."
"2109180","2112660"," If we're trading up to the right, we're trading sideways and down. "
"2113620","2117160"," So we'll look at all that stuff, some simple ways for you to do that without having to get all"
"2117160","2117540"," complicated."
"2120060","2122080"," Take to actually get an answer for this."
"2123940","2125840"," There are easy ways to dumb shit down. "
"2126960","2128780"," So you're not overcomplicating the market."
"2128780","2136600"," Because I'm assuming that most of you are overcomplicating the markets and get fucking destroyed"
"2136600","2138280"," over complicating markets."
"2139360","2142440"," When reality, what matters to you?"
"2143240","2144660"," What matters to you?"
"2145400","2149140"," That you leave every day with more money than you started, right?"
"2150300","2154160"," Every week, whatever metric you use a week, month, a year. "
"2155140","2158920"," That you leave with more money than you came to this market with, right?"
"2159760","2160820"," So let's be honest."
"2161440","2163200"," I don't fucking care how much you know."
"2164500","2166820"," I don't fucking care what technical suit you know. "
"2167380","2170000"," The only thing that I care about is that you leave with more money."
"2171100","2176260"," You can go on to fin to it and you can stroke yourself off all day long, right?"
"2176360","2177440"," And that means shit."
"2178280","2180880"," The only thing that means something is that you walk away with money. "
"2180880","2187820"," And I always noticed when I was a trader, the more complicated I made things, the less money I"
"2187820","2188040"," made."
"2188980","2190880"," My vision became unclear."
"2191300","2194000"," You ever notice some engineers are like this?"
"2194940","2200900"," An engineer does a great job of not all engineers, but a lot of engineers do a great job designing"
"2200900","2201620"," things, right?"
"2202560","2209680"," Making things, but then their practicality and usefulness sometimes can get tripped up. "
"2209680","2218040"," My father-in-law is an engineer and kind of a famous engineer, to some extent, but"
"2218040","2221940"," he always lived by that mantra."
"2222440","2228080"," You only make it simplified as much as you can, dumb it down as much as you can so it"
"2228080","2229680"," serves its function and nothing more."
"2230520","2232060"," And oftentimes, engineers don't do that, right?"
"2232500","2235980"," You ever complicate things or someone is highly intelligent. "
"2235980","2239740"," They over-engineer something so that it actually ends up failing."
"2240700","2247080"," And the more you can simplify a thought process that produces the results that you want, you're"
"2247080","2248080"," sometimes better off."
"2248260","2250980"," You'll oftentimes find new traders, new investors. "
"2251840","2253020"," You'll say that guy was lucky."
"2253200","2254040"," That girl was lucky."
"2254840","2258820"," And oftentimes their results will decline over time because they're learning too much. "
"2259580","2266000"," They oftentimes simplify things and are not looking at other things that are scaring an investor or"
"2266000","2267700"," trader, a long time trader."
"2270500","2278100"," So if it works for you to dumb shit down, I'm telling you, it does wonders, especially for a losing"
"2278100","2278980"," trader, it does wonders."
"2281940","2288720"," So with all that blah, blah, blah shit out of the way, you can see over here down here some"
"2288720","2290700"," support coming into the market down here, right?"
"2291200","2293200"," A little bit of a supportive environment down here. "
"2293280","2296100"," You can kind of see right down here."
"2296100","2299300"," Some demand is coming in right now, right?"
"2299480","2301160"," You can see right in the bottom of my screen right here."
"2301380","2302340"," Let's firm it up a little bit. "
"2302760","2307020"," There's a little bit of sell side action right here."
"2308220","2308660"," Above."
"2309140","2310860"," And you got some more sellers up here. "
"2311840","2316240"," If you're looking down inside of the demand and supply in the market."
"2316240","2316320"," Okay."
"2319520","2321160"," So all that's out of the way. "
"2322320","2323400"," Good morning, by the way."
"2323480","2324240"," Hope you're all doing well."
"2324620","2326280"," Thanks for staying strong with me. "
"2326720","2330920"," Thank you for sticking around for an entire quarter with me."
"2330980","2333540"," Any of you that have found me this quarter."
"2334220","2336600"," I want to say thank you for supporting the channel. "
"2336880","2340900"," I want to say thank you for sticking around with me, putting up with me every day."
"2341440","2342100"," And we're here what?"
"2342380","2343580"," Six, seven hours a day."
"2343580","2347420"," Then we're on fintuit talking with discord, having conversations. "
"2347780","2352480"," I guess we're kind of close to know each other more than we might know our regular friends in real"
"2352480","2352780"," life."
"2353040","2359380"," So I want to say thank you for always being here with me through thick, thin, good, bad, good days,"
"2359420","2360400"," bad days or whatever."
"2363250","2365450"," We're going to first look at the VIX here. "
"2372040","2373860"," We can see the VIX right now."
"2374000","2375320"," We had a nice collapse in the VIX."
"2375920","2380800"," There's a 30 minute chart in the VIX coming into what should be. "
"2380800","2384400"," A place historically right now."
"2386560","2389480"," Of selling right the VIX right here."
"2390000","2394240"," So bulls want to see the selling of the VIX right come back up here. "
"2394620","2398360"," And we want to drown the VIX again and reprice the VIX."
"2398880","2399520"," Right."
"2399920","2409100"," So the bull wants right there reprice the VIX. "
"2413200","2415240"," Kind of a key spot right here, right?"
"2417100","2418340"," So the VIX right now."
"2420820","2427180"," You want to see the VIX reject here which it already has in 1948 and begin to make new lows."
"2427620","2429020"," Now currently the VIX is bullish. "
"2430060","2431040"," So you have VIX is bullish."
"2431420","2432220"," It's above it's one minute."
"2432340","2433600"," It's above it's five minute. "
"2434260","2441860"," We don't want to see the VIX squeeze or else we can see a quick fast reversal on this bullishness."
"2445290","2447950"," So see how we have bullishness right here in the market."
"2447950","2454530"," We don't want to see happen is price go up and boom it's a trap for you and you're going"
"2454530","2457030"," to get buried in here. "
"2457190","2460210"," You're going to end up getting trapped in here as a bull."
"2460450","2462490"," So what are we looking for if you're a bull?"
"2463110","2464510"," Well if you're a bear what are you looking for?"
"2465370","2468970"," You're looking for 40362 to be defended right here."
"2469970","2474770"," Okay you're going to be looking for sellers to step right back in right here and try to push us"
"2474770","2476750"," lower just like they did right here. "
"2477730","2480090"," Okay if you're a bull you're just waiting."
"2481070","2481690"," You're a patient."
"2482030","2483530"," You're a patient bull right?"
"2484530","2486650"," This is a five minute chart. "
"2487530","2495510"," Well you're looking for price to regain above here right?"
"2495510","2505190"," You want to see price show you the way if you"
"2505190","2506330"," got trapped in this."
"2506830","2512330"," Remember I always talk about how if you get trapped that they should be at least one more"
"2512330","2516270"," opportunity right to reset your position here."
"2517270","2525490"," That would mean that you unfuck yourself and then you wait for confirmation here for the trade"
"2525490","2527190"," higher right here. "
"2527190","2529970"," You set the trade up and then you take it long up here."
"2530530","2534850"," I always tell you if you're trapped in a trade and they go boom they're throwing it down on you"
"2534850","2542110"," more than likely have an opportunity to unfuck yourself and then actually reset at a more less"
"2542110","2544810"," risky long position right."
"2544970","2548950"," You'd be like oh Kappa would have made money if I had just waited here in truth. "
"2549370","2552990"," You should have entered the trade here right?"
"2554270","2556530"," You should have let the market open up right?"
"2556890","2558390"," All that stuff that we talk about."
"2561780","2563880"," Remember that we have sellers here too."
"2569490","2571290"," So let this open up right now. "
"2572370","2578690"," We'll see if price can regain the one well the one minute on the five minute chart and can retest"
"2578690","2580730"," it to verify that we're going higher."
"2582610","2584890"," Now it'd be just like this right here we go higher."
"2585670","2587010"," Come back down. "
"2588150","2593190"," And then you'd be looking for the green bars taking off here and this is where you can take this"
"2593190","2597930"," trade and confidence that we are in fact going higher and you'll be looking for this resistance"
"2597930","2603910"," here as well because we could come back down and then squeeze up higher here stops underneath."
"2604810","2605650"," Makes sense."
"2612170","2613770"," Nice squeeze right now. "
"2623260","2626040"," We can delete this orange line that we have here."
"2627780","2629440"," We even need to anymore."
"2629520","2630680"," I guess I don't need to do it. "
"2631220","2635240"," Right back there you see it."
"2637060","2639500"," Going all the way back right there."
"2641740","2643060"," Look at that right there. "
"2643880","2644840"," Take right there."
"2648360","2649500"," Get rid of that one now."
"2660280","2666140"," We know the sellers right here. "
"2669310","2674150"," We know there's another box of sellers here."
"2678580","2679640"," You can see them."
"2683340","2684520"," And I'm flat right now. "
"2684640","2685600"," I've got put still."
"2685840","2686520"," I've got Friday puts."
"2687440","2691820"," But my car printed calls now I don't know fucking four or five goddamn time to be swearing. "
"2692280","2694360"," I feel like calls are printed like four times right now."
"2694780","2698500"," I have crash puts just in case I haven't sold those but no long position."
"2699100","2700220"," I want to see. "
"2701020","2703660"," Now the market open up develop."
"2705240","2707140"," I want to see this here."
"2708120","2711100"," I want to see this here. "
"2711960","2713300"," Price come down here."
"2713440","2714200"," Come back here."
"2714340","2715180"," Start to consolidate. "
"2716100","2717880"," I'm going to set up a trade for right here."
"2717880","2720200"," If this happens if this can work itself out over here."
"2720800","2722180"," Start to squeeze this up higher. "
"2723240","2724880"," But I don't want to put any risk on in here."
"2724940","2726020"," I don't want to lose my money in here."
"2726020","2728380"," I want to get ground up and repricing of options in here. "
"2728700","2729520"," None of this nonsense."
"2729520","2735400"," I got no, no, no wants or needs to trade this until we can start to prove itself that we're"
"2735400","2736140"," going higher here."
"2737000","2740080"," I don't want to see supply just feeding into me. "
"2740520","2742360"," Supply just coming into me."
"2742540","2743280"," Trap me in here."
"2743500","2745640"," Get bloodbath down here to the next level. "
"2746360","2747400"," Bloodbath down here."
"2747640","2748200"," None of this noise."
"2748400","2749140"," I want anything to do with this. "
"2750160","2751780"," I'll tell you what I do want to deal with."
"2752280","2754080"," I want to deal with this up here."
"2754240","2756280"," I want to get that price target up there. "
"2756400","2757220"," I want to get that R3."
"2759200","2759980"," Right there."
"2765420","2766220"," Ten seconds. "
"2775490","2776230"," Thanks out here."
"2779640","2781300"," Minus 47 BCF."
"2781520","2783020"," Minus 47 BCF. "
"2783200","2785840"," A build on the forecast of minus 54 BCF."
"2786680","2787880"," I want to talk to you a couple of things."
"2788080","2789140"," We got some other stuff to talk about too. "
"2789320","2790840"," I'm going to talk about a bunch of stuff this morning."
"2791660","2792700"," We're going to talk about Ukraine."
"2807420","2812140"," We're going to talk about Ukraine because then it actually relates to the debt. "
"2812140","2818700"," The debt ceiling or could potentially relate to the debt ceiling."
"2820360","2824680"," I want to see this nice bull cross up here."
"2824800","2826400"," There's a one minute chart right now. "
"2826460","2826880"," I want to see."
"2828400","2830520"," We're back off the five minute chart."
"2830520","2831940"," I want to see this right here. "
"2835620","2836620"," Excuse me in the one minute."
"2836620","2837160"," I want to see this."
"2842810","2844850"," I want to see a successful retest. "
"2845530","2847070"," Please up higher retest."
"2849610","2851270"," Something like that."
"2864980","2866420"," All right. "
"2867440","2870560"," We're going to talk about cycles."
"2873320","2878460"," Hold on here with the SPX."
"2885150","2889230"," The way is that one of the two year up on that, I don't know. "
"2894370","2900840"," PPO, PPM on a larger timeframe."
"2931390","2933690"," We're going to check back on the five minute real quick here."
"2935510","2937630"," Now trading above the five minute here. "
"2944740","2946300"," This is a one minute chart right here."
"3002360","3004260"," I got this thing open for you here."
"3011240","3014360"," You should have this open at home. "
"3014580","3017820"," You're going to be looking for on a one minute chart."
"3018000","3019340"," You'll be looking for this to come up."
"3020680","3027740"," You'll be looking for this to come underneath. "
"3029580","3031200"," You'll be looking for an entry."
"3031840","3033300"," Unless you're maybe you're already long out there."
"3033380","3033580"," I don't know. "
"3033600","3034660"," Maybe you are already."
"3035660","3043380"," I'm going to be looking for that squeeze up here to 405.33. 405.60. 80."
"3043740","3043880"," Above. "
"3048950","3050390"," I'm looking at 40."
"3051650","3056330"," I'm going to see 405s are 36 cents."
"3057370","3058590"," Zero dates for today. "
"3065510","3067850"," They're 30.29 cents right now."
"3070130","3072170"," This is liquidation breakdown below."
"3072170","3075590"," Trying to throw it back down on bulls and sell down here. "
"3077170","3079170"," It's the original sell right here."
"3082490","3083090"," Sellers."
"3083530","3086010"," This is the second sell right here. "
"3086950","3087550"," Sellers."
"3090450","3092870"," You want to see this hold up here."
"3093250","3094410"," I've got the trade set up. "
"3095350","3098410"," Now if I start to see, hold on here."
"3107000","3109300"," If I start to see price, stay above here."
"3112590","3113970"," I've got the trade set up. "
"3116170","3118450"," It starts to see price moving higher here."
"3118970","3119730"," I'll take that trade."
"3120050","3122890"," Now if I don't see that, what is showing up here?"
"3123050","3123310"," Do you know?"
"3125310","3128910"," If we don't see that, if we see price, what are we setting up?"
"3129050","3132210"," We're setting up two bear flags or not bear flags, two bear planes, right?"
"3132790","3133950"," Get the one cross right here. "
"3134910","3137150"," And you'll end up getting another cross right here."
"3138390","3140670"," And you'll see price start to bloodbath down."
"3141470","3147630"," It's 10.36. So six minutes ago, we did not see a new low, right?"
"3147910","3150030"," So here's 10.30. Did not see a new low. "
"3150830","3151870"," What is that telling you?"
"3152170","3156030"," It's telling you that we're trying to consolidate and not sell the market, right?"
"3156470","3159250"," We're trying to actually go higher here, right?"
"3159590","3162810"," No new low at 10.30. Right?"
"3162990","3167570"," So that's a check mark for the bulls that we're not going to sell here."
"3177760","3179600"," I've got some for you to see in the background here."
"3181740","3183340"," Got some targets on high. "
"3188380","3190560"," Four or five C's are 28 cents."
"3192880","3194440"," Got my eyes on them."
"3200740","3201300"," Patience. "
"3212640","3214120"," Okay, well, I'm waiting for this to develop."
"3216440","3217580"," Well, I'm waiting for this to develop."
"3217660","3219940"," I'm going to switch over to something else for you to see. "
"3231310","3232850"," Peru is on fin to it."
"3232870","3236610"," And he said you should expect two to four weeks, maybe four to six weeks."
"3237410","3238450"," Don't quote me on this stuff. "
"3238930","3242150"," I only saw his post briefly where he said the market could go up."
"3242250","3244470"," It could be irrational for four to six weeks."
"3244470","3248250"," I was like, it could remain rational for an entire year. "
"3249350","3250590"," Fuck four to six weeks."
"3250970","3252870"," I was like, I was like an entire year is on deck."
"3255130","3256850"," Of course, with risk of a crash. "
"3258350","3262750"," Throw it in for throw it in for for a good, spicy mix for the year."
"3264490","3267030"," If peru's take would to work out."
"3268730","3271930"," You shouldn't go after peru if we have weakness. "
"3271930","3276810"," Next week or for two weeks or for even a month."
"3279050","3281970"," Peru's statement could still remain valid."
"3282670","3283830"," So we'll look to see today. "
"3284770","3288350"," If that how does his take remain valid."
"3289550","3294350"," You don't want to like come screaming at peru and be like, Hey, you were fucking wrong."
"3294490","3299230"," We sold down 300 points or 200 points because this point is likely still valid. "
"3299890","3305510"," If we had a hundred point drop 200 point drop, his point would still be somewhat valid."
"3305990","3310490"," So we're going to look at that right now and see if it is valid or not."
"3310810","3312910"," And I don't really ever really don't care if he is joking or not. "
"3313050","3315130"," We're going to talk about that original point."
"3321390","3325270"," You can also watch another thing that I like to do here is sometimes I like to draw."
"3326690","3328330"," Nice little line right there. "
"3328550","3332190"," You can see where the sellers actually are."
"3333730","3334450"," They're right here."
"3334610","3335070"," They're right here. "
"3335350","3336770"," And we're going to see if they're right here too."
"3352210","3352770"," All right."
"3353050","3353630"," So you guys have it. "
"3353750","3355490"," Guys, you guys don't need news for this anymore."
"3355850","3356230"," Okay."
"3358130","3359050"," So hold on here. "
"3359810","3361430"," Let me get rid of this."
"3368490","3370910"," I'm going to bring up something in peru's argument."
"3371470","3372030"," Peru's favor. "
"3372310","3373290"," Just simple stuff."
"3373870","3374270"," Very simple."
"3376130","3377070"," This is SPX. "
"3378530","3380110"," We're looking at SPX right now."
"3381870","3383590"," And let's look at a few things here."
"3384730","3385650"," So SPX. "
"3386690","3393790"," This is a daily PMO, PPO, and a PMO breadth perspective."
"3394830","3396210"," At least on a daily chart."
"3397230","3398210"," Looking kind of bullish here, right?"
"3400590","3402250"," Bull's kind of saving the day up here. "
"3402450","3404570"," And you can actually see this begin to curl up here, right?"
"3405710","3407450"," And also see down here."
"3408290","3410770"," At least price, price versus."
"3412170","3415410"," I talk about this on streams sometimes where price matters. "
"3417590","3420970"," And when you're looking at cycles, price matters."
"3422290","3428790"," If we have price velocity to the downside, in a cycle, right?"
"3428990","3431430"," Some cycles we have some major price velocity down some."
"3431810","3432230"," Sometimes we don't. "
"3433130","3433210"," Right?"
"3434370","3436230"," You actually see it more clearly here, right?"
"3438110","3445210"," And my point here is that right now bulls, right now today, bulls are like, yeah, man, we can"
"3445210","3446350"," totally do this right here."
"3448170","3448930"," You see that?"
"3449530","3451810"," And bulls are like, yeah, we can actually do that too."
"3452110","3458690"," We can have weakness next week and still come up here and then rotate the market, then come down. "
"3459550","3460510"," So I'm like that right there."
"3461390","3462490"," Sometimes we can get rotation, right?"
"3462490","3464190"," These are our bears trying to time tops."
"3464750","3469690"," You know how we have when we when we crash when we roll over, it's usually fast, right?"
"3470410","3470870"," Elevator down. "
"3472270","3477790"," When we are going up, we typically rotate into a new sector, rotate into a new sector, rotating"
"3477790","3479150"," sector, juice."
"3479430","3485010"," Oh, not fees, but you'll see hedge funds and hedge funds institutions will capture each sector."
"3485230","3486190"," Then we roll over, right?"
"3489870","3493710"," So on a daily chart, you know, our breath isn't too much. "
"3494790","3496030"," Our breath can go up more."
"3496590","3499090"," We are cresting and turning on PPO."
"3500150","3502630"," And, you know, there's that argument to you right there. "
"3502790","3508090"," I mean, there can be an argument they've made that three, four weeks on a daily chart, at least"
"3508090","3515270"," looks like that with just these indicators here, just these pre indicators telling you we can still"
"3515270","3515610"," go up."
"3518190","3518990"," Over time."
"3520250","3521870"," And April's our best month, right?"
"3522030","3523550"," There's a whole bunch of stuff we know about this, right?"
"3524350","3530110"," But then in a higher time frame, a weekly, some other fascinating things to look at in a weekly"
"3530110","3530510"," here. "
"3532690","3538650"," We talk about the business cycle goes on, whether you want it to or not, whether the Fed wants it"
"3538650","3539170"," to or not."
"3540590","3542150"," But the business cycle just keeps going."
"3542150","3544950"," And you can do whatever you can do during that time period. "
"3546350","3551010"," And whether you make an impact or make people believe that you're making an impact."
"3552650","3556070"," You know that there are Fed people that say we don't really make an impact."
"3556410","3557550"," We just time it right. "
"3558170","3559590"," So it looks like we're doing something."
"3560010","3561110"," Looks like we're doing our jobs."
"3561850","3564910"," The vaunted halls of the new economist. "
"3566650","3567490"," And just right here."
"3569530","3571350"," Just right here in a weekly basis."
"3572790","3574350"," There can be an argument made. "
"3575690","3578750"," That for now, for just right fucking now."
"3579970","3581210"," That we had our first drop."
"3581450","3583830"," You could still be bearish here and say that we had our drop. "
"3584830","3586030"," We had our drop."
"3587730","3589150"," On a weekly basis."
"3590610","3593350"," They can be an argument made that will have. "
"3594250","3595290"," A year."
"3596510","3597650"," Of going up."
"3600130","3601810"," Sure as shit looking like it. "
"3603070","3604850"," Right in the scary part is."
"3606370","3608630"," You want to see that bad boy right there."
"3608630","3611950"," And the neatest part about this right here is we had declining. "
"3615750","3616350"," Right."
"3616610","3617470"," That was telling you."
"3618390","3620910"," Way back here in April. "
"3627370","3631810"," And the market can remain rational."
"3632710","3635430"," Far longer than you can short it into the depths of hell."
"3636130","3637630"," And even once you do get it right. "
"3638390","3639670"," Look where we are right back there."
"3642170","3642630"," Remember."
"3643290","3645530"," This is where Mike Barry needed. "
"3646470","3646930"," In a way."
"3649570","3651750"," He needed that second leg down."
"3652310","3652450"," Right. "
"3652930","3653770"," He would have been he'd be the fire."
"3653770","3656670"," I'm a fucking prison probably to be suitably was sued but."
"3657250","3659010"," If you don't get that next leg. "
"3659690","3662370"," You know your bearishness actually didn't pay off."
"3663030","3663790"," See what I'm saying."
"3664510","3666010"," Just right down here. "
"3666310","3667750"," There is an argument."
"3670390","3672990"," This market can go up not just four to six weeks."
"3675210","3677210"," Like a whole fucking year. "
"3678190","3681850"," And you can tell you can tell me to your blue in the face why we should go down."
"3681850","3684050"," I remember here."
"3685070","3686190"," I'm a right here. "
"3686670","3691670"," We were we had a silent bear market going on and the S&P 500 just kept going up and"
"3691670","3692810"," it was always an excuse."
"3693410","3697190"," Let's corporate debt-backed securities on on four stocks holding up the market."
"3697190","3704630"," Yesterday I was like yesterday until I had compared Snap with NVIDIA I was like well Snap hasn't"
"3704630","3705030"," done shit. "
"3705630","3710930"," Well Snap has not over over performed and you hear this mantra four stocks holding up the entire"
"3710930","3711630"," stock market."
"3711890","3718470"," Yesterday Snap I'm like it's underperforming and then I compare it to to NVIDIA and I go shit that"
"3718470","3723390"," thing's running just like NVIDIA just on a smaller fucking scale and that's what most of the market"
"3723390","3732250"," is like unless you have some outsized divergent move in a ticker like XLF tickers the market's been"
"3732250","3737930"," fucking all moving up all fucking tech been going up just like NVIDIA has on the same path to some"
"3737930","3744430"," extent so you know there's an argument here for bulls there is an argument here I'm not talking"
"3744430","3753440"," about with momentary weakness I'm not talking about momentary week this like we have a down month"
"3753440","3758440"," or something I'm talking about like this is this some time here and if you look on this one right"
"3758440","3765240"," here in this weekly shit we got weeks leading into months that we can go up and then rotate"
"3765240","3774760"," sideways we can have one bad month in a quarter one bad month like you see here"
"3774760","3783720"," like you see here and still irrationally go up so conditions are improving for bulls I got to"
"3785480","3795380"," give them let's take a monthly improving"
"3795380","3804720"," a little bit not great not great but look at this declining"
"3804720","3812080"," velocity to the downside on PPO monthly"
"3812080","3819720"," right this is telling you oh you still got risk of a of a crash ahead like yeah I agree"
"3819720","3826920"," with that breath is going down declining right now I agree with that last time we had breath go"
"3826920","3836380"," down now what do we do we fucking scream tire we are rationally just blasted higher"
"3836380","3846360"," on a monthly not so bad now this can all change on a dime all this all that"
"3846360","3854100"," like all these indicators and sometimes they mean shit right if they meant everything if they meant"
"3854100","3859880"," everything in watch this right here as they're down here is the down here truck still like sell"
"3859880","3865940"," sell sell sell sell they mean they mean there's good as there's good as the paper they're written"
"3865940","3874120"," on right as good as the paper that they're written on that's about it right so the messy ass chart"
"3874120","3879740"," so I was trying to hear me yeah mute some of this stuff here just close that up right there"
"3879740","3890440"," let me give you some of some idea here of what"
"3890440","3901170"," we're talking about here is SPX on a weekly right just"
"3901170","3908530"," looking at the candlesticks old-school traditional charting here you could actually you could have"
"3908530","3913170"," a bloodbath down here you could close the gap you could fail to close the gap come right back down"
"3913170","3921870"," here slamming here and still be bullish for a move if you look at this white line right here you"
"3921870","3928750"," could just trade this right here and this is a sideways market you could trade this green box up"
"3928750","3936270"," here see this green line up here is terrible but you could trade just this coast to coast and still"
"3936270","3946050"," be bullish right we could we could we could still be"
"3946050","3956050"," bullish and still per would be right now if you broke below 3807"
"3956050","3966620"," if you broke below 3807 that would"
"3966620","3974340"," be your bear market rally right that Barry talks about right you start tracking this kind of"
"3974340","3982600"," nonsense down here you get yourself a new low right you're breaking that previous we haven't broken"
"3982600","3991540"," that heavily this run we haven't broken heavily so far we got a higher low we got another higher"
"3991540","4001370"," low we got another higher low some some pretty fucking bullish to me I've heard people say"
"4001370","4008050"," oh yeah last time we did this we crashed out a thousand points sure but you got some shit you"
"4008050","4012850"," got to do like you got to get through this 3,900 now now you got to get now you"
"4012850","4020490"," have to get through 3,900 then you got to get through 3,800 but even then they could just"
"4020490","4029710"," do a recheck this dream of the low here at 3600 just as a recheck on the low and go"
"4029710","4034830"," right back up here again so man I'll tell you what I'll tell you has work to do fucking bears"
"4034830","4044530"," have a ton of work to do bears have so much work to do bulls don't have this work I'm"
"4044530","4051050"," sorry that's the truth they don't you bears got work to do bears got to like smash through levels"
"4051050","4057990"," smash through sport smash through buyers now I know we have declining velocity in the on higher"
"4057990","4065010"," time frames I see that too that's a check mark in the book bears favor but this right here man"
"4065010","4072200"," is telling you a different story this right here is all telling you a different story if we have"
"4072200","4079400"," that capitulate if we are trading the sideways move here what are you doing here what do you what"
"4079400","4084940"," do we sit on your hands for if we have one one more quick move down that's just another buying"
"4084940","4091040"," opportunity to go higher over five years so what do you do to this market is you trade it to"
"4091040","4097920"," the left and to the right and up and you hedge it as you go you know until we start"
"4097920","4103580"," hitting some some key targets here you know like even down here like like if you're a bear if you"
"4103580","4111040"," want if you're saying that we're bearish or we're gonna do this trade here you got some levels here"
"4111040","4118240"," that you need to you know hit right if you don't hit these levels down here I'm sorry man we're"
"4118240","4123680"," trading sideways and up that's what we're doing so you know even if you're even if you're bearish"
"4123680","4131260"," on Friday even if you're bearish on Friday and you want to hedge this market here you get some"
"4131260","4138100"," rational squeeze up and you want to take this right even then it has to be in the money has"
"4138100","4146890"," to be because we could go here you know it doesn't mean we don't come back down here eventually you"
"4146890","4152189"," just put time on your shorts it's put time on your it's put like a three month in the money"
"4152189","4158510"," fucking sus put spread or something I guess I guess you can irrational it not a rationally but you"
"4158510","4163330"," can you can short or however you want to mechanically do it but this is on the table you can't"
"4163330","4169609"," say that's not on the table you can't because we did we it was on the table here it was"
"4169609","4179180"," on the table there it was on the table right here it was on the table there there and there"
"4179180","4186180"," so as far as you're concerned if you're a bear if you're a bear as far as you're concerned we"
"4186180","4192620"," can fucking trade all the way up here just make sure that your puts can handle that now let's say"
"4192620","4198540"," we crash down here I crash but bounce then we go up here you can be trapped so it's not"
"4198540","4203140"," that you can't take this trade and say if to manage it and and know it maybe you take the"
"4203140","4208440"," maybe you take this put or or short here and then you trade this up if you have to that"

"17889280","17898260"," that's what i'm looking for uh this place here this dotted line that we're constantly looking at on"
"17898260","17907540"," a higher time frame just so you can see it remember yesterday they're right here at buyers right"
"17907540","17917200"," demand demand and now we're now we're underneath right and sellers are coming in and sellers"
"17917200","17926760"," so we we we went underneath and now we we have known sellers here on the vix"
"17926760","17933700"," slam and now we just want a little bit more confirmation so we can go lower and start to sell"
"17933700","17941700"," the vix so with that idea in my mind now even if we come up here right this would be"
"17941700","17946500"," the dip in spy right let's be the dip right get a little bit of this and then it rolls"
"17946500","17954500"," down and you squeeze up into the close or there's a bigger dip and then we rocket into the close"
"17954500","17964040"," or after the close tomorrow when i don't want to see is a close like this we're"
"17964040","17970740"," rocketing up over 20 bucks now that would scare me into tomorrow uh i'm not going to lie to you"
"17970740","17975140"," and tell you it's it's not this would scare me into tomorrow that would show me that we might have"
"17975140","17981500"," a week overnight uh then we then we have to buy the dip on the bell tomorrow so vix so"
"17981500","17988900"," far right now i'm going to monitor it into the close but for what i'm looking for what that implies"
"17988900","17998120"," to me that i'm looking for is i'm looking for a place to buy a dip for tomorrow so i'm"
"17998120","18008260"," looking for this line to hold on the five minute i'm looking for confirmation that"
"18008260","18018400"," we're going up into this bell right oh dude"
"18018400","18027500"," seriously fucking pain that i'm looking for here is this right here and the next you know 15"
"18027500","18036400"," minutes or so heading into power hour i don't really care about this stuff here what i care about"
"18036400","18044100"," is coming into like three o'clock right and finding out if we start to go up into this bell"
"18045120","18051300"," even if we slam back down and then we go up into this bell is what i'm looking for okay"
"18051300","18058880"," so this is my plan this is my belief now if we dip below here for a minute i'm not"
"18058880","18064860"," overly concerned about this either what i am concerned about is down here i don't want to see us"
"18064860","18071660"," like blood bath down reject here and start blasting down this way and getting a new low in the day"
"18071660","18076600"," so these are all things that i'm looking for in two three o'clock if we do blast down into"
"18076600","18080760"," the bell down here i know i have places already in mind that i want to buy a dip for"
"18080760","18085040"," tomorrow so it's another dip buying opportunity there's an opportunity to get up here into the"
"18085040","18092260"," close my conviction is to the upside and it has to do with the underlay relying reasons why we"
"18092260","18096900"," should be going up in the end of quarter i know there's supply above i know there's window dressing"
"18096900","18101360"," needs done i know there's gex reasons i know that there's gamma reasons i know there's magnet"
"18101360","18107040"," reasons i know that there's tax purposes for these companies that are along the market now they"
"18107040","18111560"," need they need uh they actually need fair value right for the for the stuff that they own even"
"18111560","18115600"," though they short it right they need to make they have a basket of shit that they're going to take"
"18115600","18119640"," shorts off they're going to reset them on high and re-short them again next week a whole bunch of"
"18119640","18125160"," shit going on in the background so my take here is we're going fucking up into the close now if"
"18125160","18128880"," i'm wrong i'm i know what to look for if i'm wrong right so if i'm like i'm gonna conviction"
"18128880","18133840"," trade here and if i'm proven wrong i need at least know what to look for for i'm wrong so"
"18133840","18140020"," that i can reset myself uh or or reposition myself if my conviction is proved wrong right because"
"18140020","18144060"," you're never going to be right a hundred percent of the time you just have to plan for your"
"18144060","18149960"," conviction look for those things to happen uh to make them true and if if you're then disproven"
"18149960","18155140"," just like a math equation right a did some wrong here um then you then you reposition yourself"
"18155140","18159540"," reset yourself take the opposite side of the training and they kind of stuff so um just looking"
"18159540","18164080"," here for the next i'm going to take a break here for 14 minutes now so i'm going to expect"
"18164080","18169540"," some weakness into this next 14 minutes and then i'm going to wait for the power i'm going to i'm"
"18169540","18174760"," going to expect there to be a buy side into this close and it's going to be the worst fucking"
"18174760","18184030"," possible price for these buyers which is which is high not low if you don't know that it's on it's"
"18184030","18192470"," on the high you know iWM"
