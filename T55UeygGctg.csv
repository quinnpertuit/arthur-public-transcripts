"T55UeygGctg","124140","128260"," trading group together a private trading group in a private room I think it was"

"T55UeygGctg","148540","152060"," like a morning brief from David and then we'd check in with each other"
"T55UeygGctg","152060","156260"," sometimes in a day as well I'd try to send him a DM and he'd send me DMS and"
"T55UeygGctg","156260","160780"," well in these trading rooms if there was a pit it was usually him and I in that"
"T55UeygGctg","160780","168220"," pit trading together and I said no idea what they were doing I think it was"
"T55UeygGctg","168220","176580"," weird and so that's how we got to know each other and we fell apart and I"
"T55UeygGctg","176580","179460"," didn't we I didn't become I wasn't no longer a part of that trading group I"
"T55UeygGctg","179460","183940"," ended up going on my own years a year later I was like man if he can ever come"
"T55UeygGctg","183940","188180"," our way so I reached out to my thinker I forgot to I didn't couldn't find his"
"T55UeygGctg","188180","191660"," name and then I finally found his name like a year or two later and I was like"
"T55UeygGctg","191660","195660"," we can get David with us with our group it's gonna be fucking nothing but net"
"T55UeygGctg","195740","200340"," positive and he reached back out to me and I was like I gotta get out my hands"
"T55UeygGctg","200340","205500"," and knees and begging plead to have some David in our lives and he's been there"
"T55UeygGctg","205500","212580"," for us every day since he spends his time in our discord in our futures channel"
"T55UeygGctg","212580","217220"," spends a lot of time with John L and those guys are trying to crack the"
"T55UeygGctg","217220","221540"," market together it's wild and if you don't know this guy is this is David AMS"
"T55UeygGctg","221540","228060"," follow him on you on Twitter on discord and I'll let him take it away from here"
"T55UeygGctg","228060","232220"," so go ahead David you're not gonna get much from me from Twitter I'm actually"
"T55UeygGctg","232220","238900"," sort of pretty quiet on social media front doing much with it but yeah no but"
"T55UeygGctg","238900","245340"," we we were together in in the trading room with Bob Kendall when we started"
"T55UeygGctg","245340","251460"," and yeah we're yeah I think we we we left at the same time and then sort of"
"T55UeygGctg","251460","255940"," went on our own journeys to to figure out you know because like I started"
"T55UeygGctg","255940","261660"," trading during covid or right before covid and yeah we were trying to figure"
"T55UeygGctg","261660","268020"," out how the markets worked and those kind of things and then in the end my"
"T55UeygGctg","268020","274020"," journey was quite long and I used to work a lot with book map but yeah now I"
"T55UeygGctg","274060","279300"," don't use any of that anymore actually so because it's it's all distractions"
"T55UeygGctg","279300","284380"," really for me it's it's creating biases while you shouldn't you know"
"T55UeygGctg","284380","290380"," trade based on where you see a red band on the liquidity and then about a"
"T55UeygGctg","290380","295700"," year and a half ago I stumbled across ICT as trading system and I had my own"
"T55UeygGctg","295700","300020"," system in place and I was profitable but I wanted to optimize it so I was"
"T55UeygGctg","300020","305780"," always looking to see how you know to get things done properly sorry I'm"
"T55UeygGctg","305780","311860"," being distracted by this pussy here she's like nagging me for food so she's"
"T55UeygGctg","311860","319660"," joining the stream yeah so I started to work with that system about a year ago"
"T55UeygGctg","319660","324380"," and that was like the big game changer for me in that sense where I started to"
"T55UeygGctg","324380","329620"," look at the market at a completely different way and yeah not going back"
"T55UeygGctg","329620","335140"," you know doing it a percent so now like I just wait for specific setups to"
"T55UeygGctg","335140","341740"," unfold at specific times of day and and then if it shows up it shows up and if"
"T55UeygGctg","341740","348780"," it doesn't I stay out so and in the meantime I tend to scalp when I know it's"
"T55UeygGctg","348780","354340"," heading towards a certain direction or when I expect a specific reversal to"
"T55UeygGctg","354340","359500"," occur at a specific time I will take the other side of of whatever is"
"T55UeygGctg","359500","364060"," happening because the market is actually not really moving on like buying and"
"T55UeygGctg","364060","369220"," selling you know in my opinion it's moving based on where liquidity is"
"T55UeygGctg","369220","375740"," located at such as stops so there are basically three things I keep an eye on"
"T55UeygGctg","375740","382420"," and those are our recent swing highs and lows and the midpoint and the midnight"
"T55UeygGctg","382460","389980"," open for New York time is a very important area for me to work from and"
"T55UeygGctg","389980","394900"," yeah these setups like you just said you know I'm waiting for a specific setup"
"T55UeygGctg","394900","402260"," to develop between like 12 o'clock New York time and about 130 but it only"
"T55UeygGctg","402260","405700"," happens in certain market conditions and like today is not a good one to do it"
"T55UeygGctg","405700","410860"," because we are obviously trending and when I see these big hourly candles like"
"T55UeygGctg","410860","415500"," yeah yeah going that big you know I stay out I'm not gonna pick a top or a"
"T55UeygGctg","415500","420380"," bottom in that case however like in situations where you have like a"
"T55UeygGctg","420380","428060"," sell-off going off and like for example if we reach that specific low or that I"
"T55UeygGctg","428060","434740"," have marked up previously at noon I will mean revert it back because it doesn't"
"T55UeygGctg","434740","439580"," really matter what state the market is in for some reason at that time there's"
"T55UeygGctg","439620","446420"," always a drawn liquidity back to where stops are located at and even if it's"
"T55UeygGctg","446420","452860"," continued if it's going to continue down trending in a specific direction they"
"T55UeygGctg","452860","456020"," will take out those stops first before they continue to move the market down"
"T55UeygGctg","456020","462460"," on an exceptional basis or like maybe it happens once a month or"
"T55UeygGctg","462460","466340"," something like that it will continue without like adhering to the rules but"
"T55UeygGctg","466340","473140"," the setup does show up like three or four times a week at least and that's"
"T55UeygGctg","473140","477460"," all you need because like you get 10 points 15 points and if you manage to"
"T55UeygGctg","477460","483100"," you know to position yourself in the right options you can get big gains and"
"T55UeygGctg","483100","487980"," a lot of times you will get like the high or low of the day to be made at that"
"T55UeygGctg","487980","494220"," point and yeah and and like where I make my most of my money is really in the"
"T55UeygGctg","494260","500340"," London Open because there's a specific setup that always happens there's a"
"T55UeygGctg","500340","507700"," range that is set during the Asian session and in London they will always go"
"T55UeygGctg","507700","512420"," back to either the Asian high or the Asian low and then go back to the mid"
"T55UeygGctg","512420","518660"," yeah so and I don't care if it goes further or if I'm in it or not you know"
"T55UeygGctg","518660","524100"," I'm quite nimble in what I what I get I can get more out of it and and you"
"T55UeygGctg","524100","529060"," know that's that's a process that will take years even because it's not I'm a"
"T55UeygGctg","529060","533820"," bad person to be able to hold my runners for like a move like this like this"
"T55UeygGctg","533820","539500"," level here where we bounced I had this marked out on Monday already and you"
"T55UeygGctg","539500","543780"," know but like the reason why I stayed out and I actually shut down the computer"
"T55UeygGctg","543780","547460"," and I left the house because I had some nice weather here and I thought you know"
"T55UeygGctg","547460","550860"," I went to the gym and I you know it was pretty nice outside and then I thought"
"T55UeygGctg","550860","555820"," to myself well first of all there are a few things that are red flags for me"
"T55UeygGctg","555820","560500"," because the problem was is that dollar and yes we're dropping at the same time"
"T55UeygGctg","560500","566940"," this morning which is something I do not like because I usually like trading"
"T55UeygGctg","566940","573060"," in in burst so if dollar goes down and the market goes up that's like something"
"T55UeygGctg","573060","576640"," for me to keep an eye on and I like doing that and that wasn't the case this"
"T55UeygGctg","576640","581440"," morning so even though I had like we spoke about it on Friday what the"
"T55UeygGctg","581440","586040"," bias was because we I think we both opened up the calls on Friday afternoon"
"T55UeygGctg","586040","591040"," or after the close yeah we said hey listen you know something's up because"
"T55UeygGctg","591040","597440"," like we were watching NASDAQ and I even posted it in a discord I said you you"
"T55UeygGctg","597440","602520"," know guys watch this level because that 15 105 is is something's happening"
"T55UeygGctg","602520","608360"," there's Sonos SPX calls they're buying all those NQ yeah yeah calls for today"
"T55UeygGctg","608360","614840"," or for yesterday yeah yeah and I don't use book map anymore so sometimes I log"
"T55UeygGctg","614840","619440"," into YouTube and then and I don't really care what happens like during the"
"T55UeygGctg","619440","624840"," session itself but I like to watch it the last 30 minutes because especially"
"T55UeygGctg","624840","630120"," when when they're dropping things down and you see ice buying I know from my"
"T55UeygGctg","630160","636120"," experience in the past that that will last for at least a few days after you"
"T55UeygGctg","636120","641360"," know even though they can drop it below it in my mind they are actually"
"T55UeygGctg","641360","645960"," accumulating in that area and and it doesn't mean that that's going to be"
"T55UeygGctg","645960","650760"," the low that day or anything because explain that accumulating part two because"
"T55UeygGctg","650760","656400"," that'll know if everybody here understands like taking the emphasis off"
"T55UeygGctg","656400","660200"," bearish and bullish and more that it's accumulating at these rock bottom"
"T55UeygGctg","660200","664080"," prices and then distributing well you know it doesn't really matter where"
"T55UeygGctg","664080","667960"," price is you know it's the game that they're playing it's it's like it's"
"T55UeygGctg","667960","673480"," divided into four quarters so you have an accumulation phase is the first phase"
"T55UeygGctg","673480","678200"," which is usually on a Monday and then on Tuesday you have this manipulation"
"T55UeygGctg","678200","684600"," phase and on Wednesday you have the distribution and then on Thursday you"
"T55UeygGctg","684600","692200"," either have a continuation or reversal or of whatever day we're doing so Monday"
"T55UeygGctg","692200","696840"," is always like a laid-back day for me in that sense and like yesterday everyone"
"T55UeygGctg","696840","701600"," was complaining that the market was like shit but like for me it's my bread and"
"T55UeygGctg","701600","705920"," butter because it's it's stable you know so it's predictable for me let's say"
"T55UeygGctg","705920","712920"," that one more time so Monday is cumulation day yeah Tuesday's manipulation day"
"T55UeygGctg","712960","720240"," yeah oftentimes retailers will call that turn around Tuesday right correct yeah"
"T55UeygGctg","720240","725440"," yeah and of course it doesn't work out every time but no no no it's a perfect"
"T55UeygGctg","725440","730200"," example how it was you know it's like it's it's I guess you could call it the"
"T55UeygGctg","730200","735480"," Judas swing in a sense because like the point is that they're dropping it down"
"T55UeygGctg","735480","739480"," trapping everyone in into shorts at the lower end and then they you know rip"
"T55UeygGctg","739480","749320"," your face yeah so and like I had my like I thought something like that was"
"T55UeygGctg","749320","752760"," going to happen but like you know yesterday I had a really good day and I"
"T55UeygGctg","752760","756480"," said to myself you know okay you know there's no need to meet beach you know"
"T55UeygGctg","756480","761760"," trading this crap I'll just wait for a setup to unfold that I recognize because"
"T55UeygGctg","761760","766640"," dollar was acting up a little bit that I didn't like even though I was bearish on"
"T55UeygGctg","766680","771400"," it saying it was gonna go lower from now on you know and everyone was so"
"T55UeygGctg","771400","776160"," bullish on it and I said no well I don't I just don't see it and they were"
"T55UeygGctg","776160","782800"," whipsawing it both ways and so you know I trade at six I six E is like the"
"T55UeygGctg","782800","790200"," Euro version of the XY so I traded that this morning mostly and I took some"
"T55UeygGctg","790200","796720"," calls on on SPX but there were a few warning signs for me where that I didn't"
"T55UeygGctg","796720","801440"," like because like the bid ask was really wide and I was getting really bad"
"T55UeygGctg","801440","807880"," fills even though I was you know picking bottoms and tops in that sense with my"
"T55UeygGctg","807880","812120"," entries which was good but that gives me the room to be able to you know to"
"T55UeygGctg","812120","817760"," handle that but like taking the profit off of that is really tough because"
"T55UeygGctg","817800","825000"," let's say the premiums for example in on SPX you would think they would run it"
"T55UeygGctg","825000","830240"," up to let's say you got in at 17 or something like that and they run it up to"
"T55UeygGctg","830240","838000"," 23 or 24 dollars you don't get filled at that price so you you know I pull the"
"T55UeygGctg","838000","844160"," plug like a dollar or two before that because you know I rather secure the"
"T55UeygGctg","844160","849280"," profit than then trying to like get out at the extreme high for example you"
"T55UeygGctg","849280","856320"," know and what the setups are that I basically start to look for is is like"
"T55UeygGctg","856320","862400"," the way I'm saying it how he's divided into quarters in a week it's also like"
"T55UeygGctg","862400","869880"," that's actually during the day so those those accumulation manipulation"
"T55UeygGctg","869880","875160"," distribution and those reversal phases they also occur during the day itself"
"T55UeygGctg","875160","881360"," and so it's fractal and you can even pull it out on on on the year there's"
"T55UeygGctg","881360","888960"," this this guy called day and he came up with this theory because based on on"
"T55UeygGctg","888960","894160"," the kill zones that ICT teaches us to trade for example he was sort of like"
"T55UeygGctg","894160","898400"," trying to figure out and fine-tune them a little bit more and so it's like this"
"T55UeygGctg","898720","903160"," it's like looking at the February low than the April lows the accumulation the"
"T55UeygGctg","903160","908240"," manipulation then yeah distribution phases are even on the higher time"
"T55UeygGctg","908240","911440"," frames over the course of a year they're gonna apply them to the month or to the"
"T55UeygGctg","911440","919200"," quarter to the day with it yeah good yeah because like the month really you"
"T55UeygGctg","919200","923640"," know everyone thinks the first of the month is when the month opens but it"
"T55UeygGctg","923640","928680"," actually doesn't you know it isn't and then the week doesn't open until on a"
"T55UeygGctg","928680","936640"," Tuesday which is a bit weird because you know you would see them use that"
"T55UeygGctg","936640","944920"," level to accumulate either above or below so like for today like like and on"
"T55UeygGctg","944920","950120"," NASDAQ you know the true week open for this week we're actually on it right now"
"T55UeygGctg","950440","958080"," because that that is where let's say this week starts but you know what did"
"T55UeygGctg","958080","962600"," they do they dropped it down and they started accumulating below it and now"
"T55UeygGctg","962600","970160"," they're back at it you know so and for the month they actually were above it so"
"T55UeygGctg","970160","975160"," it's really tough because like everyone's being so bearish on the market while I"
"T55UeygGctg","975640","981960"," I look at seasonalities and you know and can they be wrong yeah of course but"
"T55UeygGctg","983560","990360"," even though it can be wrong they will still follow it in a sense you know I've noticed"
"T55UeygGctg","991480","998520"," so I try to stick my guns and keep to that plan at least and I noticed like on Monday"
"T55UeygGctg","1000280","1004760"," because like you remember on Friday we discussed that we were going to keep those calls out right"
"T55UeygGctg","1004760","1012040"," and yeah and I said I'm going to hold them well guess what on Monday I woke up and I was in profit"
"T55UeygGctg","1012040","1018040"," and I think I got like five bucks out of it or something like that in premiums and I sold them"
"T55UeygGctg","1018680","1025320"," and the reason why I did that was because I was opening up Twitter again and then you know seeing"
"T55UeygGctg","1025320","1032040"," what videos people were posting and and and their biases of these people that I you know look"
"T55UeygGctg","1032040","1038920"," highly up to and even even my mentor you know you said you know stay out of the markets it's a"
"T55UeygGctg","1038920","1046280"," mess and so I chickened out and I sold them while those premiums I bought them for eight bucks on"
"T55UeygGctg","1046280","1054200"," Friday and they ran them up yesterday to 60 you know yeah they go ran up yeah yeah so and that's"

"T55UeygGctg","1217720","1222440"," because like my bias was always clowning my judgment in that sense while I was pretty good"
"T55UeygGctg","1222920","1228920"," in saying hey we're going to go up or down but you know executing it the way you think it will"
"T55UeygGctg","1228920","1233720"," and and managing it is something different that will take time to be able to do that"
"T55UeygGctg","1234600","1242040"," and that took me years you know it's it's weird too because uh I always hear people publicly saying"

"T55UeygGctg","1301640","1310840"," overcomplicating part is usually the emotions or the mind overthinking a position um but it's there"
"T55UeygGctg","1310840","1315480"," it's there yeah even if people don't want to admit it it's usually there for most people"
"T55UeygGctg","1316280","1322440"," do you think that or no or it seems like you're describing it to some extent yeah it is because"
"T55UeygGctg","1322520","1327320"," I still have it sometimes you know it's like sometimes I think to myself off fuck man"

"T55UeygGctg","1347800","1354120"," I'm running into is where I think something will happen and then I'm dumbfounded and I'm actually"
"T55UeygGctg","1355160","1361160"," surprised it's actually doing it that that I got it right where I'm like I don't trust myself yet"

"T55UeygGctg","1394360","1402840"," um I don't really I don't watch news that much do you do you follow like an economic calendar"
"T55UeygGctg","1402840","1409000"," or you're basically using the clock for reports well I listen to the news when when you put it on"
"T55UeygGctg","1409000","1413240"," and some you know I have to stream on on the background a lot of times so I get that new squawk"
"T55UeygGctg","1413240","1418920"," and I do watch to see if there are um let's say economic releases but I just have this window"
"T55UeygGctg","1418920","1424040"," and interactive brokers that comes up and that just shows me everything and I'll just double"
"T55UeygGctg","1424040","1430760"," check that with financial juice also but like in the past I would keep track of what the economic"
"T55UeygGctg","1430760","1436280"," releases were like even the numbers and now I don't give a fuck anymore you know it doesn't"
"T55UeygGctg","1436280","1441560"," matter because it's all cooked anyway you know it's like it doesn't matter good news is bad news"
"T55UeygGctg","1441560","1446920"," the other the next day and bad news good news it doesn't matter you know you know what does"
"T55UeygGctg","1446920","1452360"," matter is where where does the price bounce like today was a perfect example you know you know I"
"T55UeygGctg","1452360","1457480"," had these these two lines marked which is which are it's called a fair failure gap that was on"
"T55UeygGctg","1457480","1463000"," the daily chart you know because we have made a low already where I was like ah fuck okay this"
"T55UeygGctg","1463000","1469720"," could be one of those three-point lows you know we have the first gap from 4 a.m. or no is what"
"T55UeygGctg","1469720","1476120"," day were you wondering if they would close the 4 a.m. gap or no you mean to go up first and then"
"T55UeygGctg","1476120","1485800"," go down no because um what was happening in London um that just like the setup that is in London"
"T55UeygGctg","1486120","1494600"," is it doesn't go up like that so um that's the trap that they put in because if you look at 3 a.m."
"T55UeygGctg","1494600","1503800"," they make the high um on yes and and that is like you know they like trap the London traders in"
"T55UeygGctg","1503800","1508440"," in that sense yeah well it doesn't matter who they are but you know what they do is they breach the"
"T55UeygGctg","1508440","1514520"," Asian high and then you you think things that are going to go up further because like we have levels"
"T55UeygGctg","1514520","1521160"," above there that we could go test like like the high of yesterday and I see them reversing"
"T55UeygGctg","1521160","1527560"," it a lot of times and then like usually when I put the trade on I get out by 5 you know like"
"T55UeygGctg","1527560","1534360"," 5 a.m. your time and even though it keeps running and like in this case we had this economic release"
"T55UeygGctg","1534360","1540200"," happening and I didn't see it but I didn't see like it dropped like that until I was outside and"
"T55UeygGctg","1540280","1543640"," watch this roll in the background if you're watching the stream right now sorry David"
"T55UeygGctg","1543640","1548440"," interrupts yeah no worries watch this roll here to the downside target to the downside 430"
"T55UeygGctg","1549560","1555400"," 643 possibly no confirmation yet no rejection to head down there um just keep an eye on that"
"T55UeygGctg","1555400","1560360"," you see that rug pull on book map right now good David sorry to interrupt brother yeah no worries"
"T55UeygGctg","1561400","1567320"," and watch the previous day high it needs to hold out 44 through 14 2 5 I think"
"T55UeygGctg","1570840","1579640"," and yeah so and when they drop those economic releases then like I stay out on the first 30"
"T55UeygGctg","1579640","1585880"," minutes I let them do whatever they want to do and then I think let me see what you're talking"
"T55UeygGctg","1585880","1592280"," to Friday about how when they're finding those highs and lows they keep coming back to those"
"T55UeygGctg","1592280","1598040"," highs and lows their importance of those highs and lows but yeah because that's where stops are"
"T55UeygGctg","1598120","1603240"," you know it's it's simple the market just moves on stops it's like where are the stops left"
"T55UeygGctg","1603240","1610600"," that's the first thing I look at and even now you know like to go back up first we need to take"
"T55UeygGctg","1610600","1617640"," out the stops so we need people to puke and even though you know when it's when it's trending up"
"T55UeygGctg","1617640","1623000"," and when the algorithms are turned on to go to a certain direction it is because they want to reach"
"T55UeygGctg","1623000","1628680"," to a certain place to yeah you can see it today right you can see them just like yeah"
"T55UeygGctg","1629160","1633400"," so I'm watching it today and I'm like you we all know they're like I said I didn't want to say"
"T55UeygGctg","1633400","1637960"," it in stream but I was I wanted what I wanted to say in stream was we all and Jimmy Barry's"

"T55UeygGctg","1649240","1652520"," gonna wait until the last minute to do it they're probably gonna go above it and then bring it back"
"T55UeygGctg","1652600","1660520"," on a market bring above and then park it into their opex at four p.m. on friday and you know"
"T55UeygGctg","1662920","1667800"," and I see it also in the premium pricing you know so like because I chart those premiums and"
"T55UeygGctg","1667800","1674520"," you see them running it down and then like like today let me have today's premiums are we're out"
"T55UeygGctg","1674520","1678360"," of control this morning they're out of control it's more in the architectural right now I mean"

"T55UeygGctg","1705720","1714040"," not much going on and I did not go short or anything because like I don't know things weren't"
"T55UeygGctg","1714040","1721160"," adding up because I started discrepancy with dollar going on and euro going up and the market was"
"T55UeygGctg","1721160","1727960"," going like dripping down and I and and then I just you know take my hands off but they dropped"
"T55UeygGctg","1727960","1734760"," those premiums all the way down to seven dollars right now so at 10 a.m. this morning they were"
"T55UeygGctg","1734760","1741080"," trading seven and now you know they ran them up to 32 I mean geez you know that's a 320"
"T55UeygGctg","1741080","1751240"," percent gain just there we were also talking about so you're talking about the rise and fall"
"T55UeygGctg","1751240","1760360"," of the a premium on an option right on SPX you also chart those out don't you on iB care or yeah"
"T55UeygGctg","1761160","1769400"," so what I do is I every morning wherever it doesn't matter where SPX has closed so"
"T55UeygGctg","1770760","1774840"," yesterday I think they closed at 68 or something like that or 73"
"T55UeygGctg","1776360","1783800"," so I just play the calls and the puts that are where SPX closed on yesterday that's it"
"T55UeygGctg","1783800","1791320"," and I said alerts on both of them at 10 bucks and I just wait for one of them to break out or"
"T55UeygGctg","1791320","1799560"," break down and then I just snatched them up for for a discount so basically like 90 percent of"
"T55UeygGctg","1799560","1806120"," my trades are always long even going short I long puts you get what I meant so that's"
"T55UeygGctg","1806600","1812760"," right yeah yeah I don't try to buy you know we have this conversation because I just"
"T55UeygGctg","1813400","1820840"," the problem I can't trade that during London and um the FV issues too don't you"
"T55UeygGctg","1822360","1826920"," not really I mean it doesn't matter those fees you know like people are always talking about"
"T55UeygGctg","1826920","1832120"," commissions and yeah I just see that I see that as cost of production I you know I don't even care"
"T55UeygGctg","1832200","1841240"," what I pay on commission um because it's just I don't know it may it may sound a little cocky"
"T55UeygGctg","1841240","1849080"," but it's just like part of the game I guess you know um there's there's not much I can do about"
"T55UeygGctg","1849080","1855480"," it and like those those few dollars I can save on it you know it's all right but I the thing is"
"T55UeygGctg","1855560","1862520"," is with spy I can only trade them in options because I'm based in Europe so for example"
"T55UeygGctg","1863400","1869960"," like buying outright a hundred shares spy I'm unable to do that unless I sell a put and get"
"T55UeygGctg","1869960","1876760"," assigned or or exercise it or something like that and then the only thing I can do within the"
"T55UeygGctg","1876760","1885800"," sell them again so um and SBX it's just you know it's trading 23 hours a day so yeah it's one of"
"T55UeygGctg","1885800","1892520"," the nice parts like an interesting ex now trades 23 a day it's awesome sauce yeah and but the thing"
"T55UeygGctg","1892520","1899400"," is is that um that you do have to take into account is is the bid asked there's a big spread"
"T55UeygGctg","1899400","1904600"," sometimes the spread can be even like 70 cents you know and that's a lot because"
"T55UeygGctg","1905560","1911480"," um like if we have a narrow range and they have such a big spread um sometimes you don't get a"
"T55UeygGctg","1911480","1917480"," proper exit even though your your direction is right um you need to be careful and time your"
"T55UeygGctg","1917480","1923320"," entries and your exits properly and that's why I just wait for these extremes to get hit first"
"T55UeygGctg","1923880","1929960"," um to take the other like the opposite side of the trade you made that comment on Friday"
"T55UeygGctg","1929960","1935560"," too didn't you trade the extremes right yeah like sitting that's what even without"
"T55UeygGctg","1935560","1939320"," ex going into too much explanation I mean Friday we went we went down the rabbit hole"
"T55UeygGctg","1941000","1948680"," but uh when I took away from or one of the things I took away you had some easy simplifications"
"T55UeygGctg","1949240","1958520"," of um how to trade and I loved what you had to say you said trade the extremes look back in time"
"T55UeygGctg","1958520","1965480"," and look for those extremes where we continue wherever we return to frequently then look for those"
"T55UeygGctg","1965480","1973240"," extremes as a place too long or short the market yeah because it's quite simple because like for me"
"T55UeygGctg","1973240","1978680"," because like for me there there are a few time windows where I keep an eye on like in the morning"
"T55UeygGctg","1978680","1985320"," it's like it's at five a.m. and the other one is at three twenty let's go start oh let's start this"
"T55UeygGctg","1985320","1990600"," uh so if you're watching this show right now get your pens and papers and your notepads out"
"T55UeygGctg","1990600","1995560"," so you just got David spoke to you about uh what each day is like not every day but"
"T55UeygGctg","1996200","2001800"," there is a flow to what each day is about right and now David's talking about extremity is going to"
"T55UeygGctg","2001880","2007960"," give you some important times of the day so go ahead David start interrupt stay on we're talking"
"T55UeygGctg","2007960","2013000"," it's it's quite simple because like you know the only thing is I post I post it in the discord"
"T55UeygGctg","2013000","2017400"," because like you have the the day is divided into four quarters you have the accumulation"
"T55UeygGctg","2017400","2023480"," manipulation distribution and then expansion or continuation or reversal for example"
"T55UeygGctg","2024360","2031160"," and they always happen in a specific order so it's always like that or the other one is is that"
"T55UeygGctg","2031160","2036600"," it expands in Q1 and then the accumulation is happening in Q2 and then make you three it's"
"T55UeygGctg","2036600","2044760"," manipulation so um you have this timetable for example that I I'll post it into the discord"
"T55UeygGctg","2044760","2051560"," where you can see what I mean with it and you're gonna post it right now the discord uh yeah I"
"T55UeygGctg","2051560","2057400"," could do that you want to post it in the general chat yeah or you know what you know don't post"
"T55UeygGctg","2057480","2062680"," in the general chat post in the futures room man let them go to the futures room and find it there"
"T55UeygGctg","2064280","2070360"," yeah because like it's it's it's quite simple like um the first place always dictates like let's"
"T55UeygGctg","2070360","2076120"," say the second the third and the fourth phase right and if the first phase is consolidation then the"
"T55UeygGctg","2076120","2082360"," second one will expand and the third will consolidate and the fourth will expand again so if the first"
"T55UeygGctg","2082360","2087000"," phase expands then the second will consolidate and the third will expand and the fourth will"
"T55UeygGctg","2087000","2093080"," consolidate and it comes down to what I was telling you you know so if Asia consolidates"
"T55UeygGctg","2093080","2099240"," then I I trade London and then I skip New York and then I trade and I trade the PM session again"
"T55UeygGctg","2099800","2106840"," like if Asia is expanding I skip London and then I trade New York in the AM and I I do not do"
"T55UeygGctg","2106840","2113880"," anything in the PM session so it's like every morning I wake up I look and see what Asia does"
"T55UeygGctg","2113960","2118440"," and then I plan my day you know and then I decide for myself what I'm going to do"
"T55UeygGctg","2118440","2123960"," so your first part of the day is finding out what is Asia doing right yeah yeah because if they're"
"T55UeygGctg","2123960","2128760"," expanding then I I got the morning off you know I just I don't need to touch it anymore because"
"T55UeygGctg","2128760","2134120"," then London chopped around unless it's if there's like a lot of rain happening you know which is"
"T55UeygGctg","2134120","2141800"," rare in that sense when when Asia has already expanded um but there are like some key times"
"T55UeygGctg","2141800","2149400"," where I do like to keep an eye on it because like at 6 a.m. something turns on also you know so I"
"T55UeygGctg","2149400","2157720"," you know I also know that at that point like I know what it does at your um let's see 12 p.m."
"T55UeygGctg","2157720","2164600"," New York time which is like my new it's the same behavior that occurs it's like these algorithms"
"T55UeygGctg","2164600","2174200"," turn on and then you know um they they they mean revert it yeah so and and and the cycle just"
"T55UeygGctg","2174200","2180360"," repeats every single day you know so you don't even need to have anything on your chart you know just"
"T55UeygGctg","2180360","2185880"," mark out the high and the low and then it will seek it on whatever 90 minutes you know it's been"
"T55UeygGctg","2185880","2192120"," doing so how many of you out there are watching the highs and lows of the Asian session the opening"
"T55UeygGctg","2192120","2198680"," of the London session and then marking the highs or assuming where we are in the US session the"
"T55UeygGctg","2198680","2203320"," New York session in the morning is everybody out there tracking those sessions or no"
"T55UeygGctg","2205800","2210280"," find out from in the chat anybody in the chat uh do do you do that or not"
"T55UeygGctg","2210280","2219240"," yeah some of you guys old gamer guy saying he does now"
"T55UeygGctg","2222280","2228600"," because it was an eye-opener for me because like I was missing this element in in understanding when"
"T55UeygGctg","2228600","2237000"," when things would turn and like I always saw this thing happening at like because it's 6 p.m. for me"
"T55UeygGctg","2237080","2241800"," which is your noon right so you're gonna bring up with these you're gonna open one of these charts"
"T55UeygGctg","2241800","2247560"," and show people this or do you want to share a chart on the screen you can uh sure so if you"
"T55UeygGctg","2247560","2257240"," look on the dave if you look on the um in the bottom of your google meet it says it should say"
"T55UeygGctg","2259240","2263880"," present now present now it's a little arrow in a box in the center if you're looking in the"
"T55UeygGctg","2263880","2269560"," bottom center of your google meet it should have a little arrow in box you can just scroll over"
"T55UeygGctg","2269560","2277320"," it and it'll pop up and say present now um yeah do you have a do you have a sex monitor or no"
"T55UeygGctg","2278280","2282440"," yeah do you see what i have here let's see if we can see what you got"
"T55UeygGctg","2284600","2287000"," yeah hold on here let me um give me a second here and i'm gonna"
"T55UeygGctg","2287000","2291960"," i'm gonna make this the um"
"T55UeygGctg","2301560","2302680"," nope hold on a second here"
"T55UeygGctg","2306920","2310920"," let's see and bring this up for everybody hold on let me go to the let me go to a full page here"
"T55UeygGctg","2310920","2315000"," brother all right let me get rid of my"
"T55UeygGctg","2322600","2330520"," say something really quick yeah okay good you're good in area okay i see that i'm"
"T55UeygGctg","2331080","2337720"," sharing my my training view at the moment is that what you want to share or no yeah cool start"
"T55UeygGctg","2337720","2344360"," talking do your thing all right okay um let me see okay so so this is a perfect example"
"T55UeygGctg","2344360","2351720"," like like i told you you know i'm always waiting for a setup to form um from noon right your time"
"T55UeygGctg","2352920","2360360"," and you see how this one here you have q1 that starts exactly at noon look the thing is i'm always"
"T55UeygGctg","2360360","2368040"," looking for a high and a low to form in q2 so you see how it's fractal like today the entire"
"T55UeygGctg","2368040","2374120"," day is um for example a manipulation day and you have to look real quick"
"T55UeygGctg","2380280","2386920"," you see the red bar here yep okay so today's manipulation"
"T55UeygGctg","2387800","2397800"," but for the monthly we are in a distribution somehow so um and what they basically divide the"
"T55UeygGctg","2397800","2403080"," day up in these quarters and you know to be honest i don't really care what goes on if it's Monday or"
"T55UeygGctg","2403080","2411080"," Tuesday what i what i look for is either a high or a low to form in q2 or q3 to trade q4"
"T55UeygGctg","2411640","2418920"," how poor now does it matter right up or down does not know i don't care if it's low i go i long"
"T55UeygGctg","2418920","2425080"," and if we're high i go short like today like you know like this thing is look for example if"
"T55UeygGctg","2426440","2432520"," i told you i'm looking for a setup always at noon right and you have this micro open but the thing is"
"T55UeygGctg","2432520","2439560"," that like in this case i'm it's difficult for me to go long even though i think we should go up to"
"T55UeygGctg","2439640","2446040"," 4430 and what i told you that 4430 that i have marked out on top here right yeah yeah i see it"
"T55UeygGctg","2446040","2452680"," um yeah but i prefer something lower you know to buy the dip now i didn't do any charting much"
"T55UeygGctg","2452680","2457000"," longer because i was talking to you so i have no idea what the hourly is doing and what it looks like"
"T55UeygGctg","2457480","2465560"," um so first thing i do two three i'm waiting for this hour to close up in nine minutes and then"
"T55UeygGctg","2466360","2470360"," something will develop and in the meantime i know we have this one here"
"T55UeygGctg","2471240","2480120"," marked that and depending what this candle closes off at we'll see because if we remain above here"
"T55UeygGctg","2481160","2487480"," um this is a place where i would look for long to go to my target this one here yeah i'm always"
"T55UeygGctg","2487480","2492440"," looking on those half hour candles for that same setup there yeah well you could use a 30 minute"
"T55UeygGctg","2492440","2496520"," one as well but i look for inefficiencies that i hear but you know these are all clean"
"T55UeygGctg","2496520","2502840"," at the moment so i don't i don't really see something happening in here and however the 30"
"T55UeygGctg","2502840","2508120"," minute one for example let's see where they'll stop it you see the midpoint of it yeah that's what"
"T55UeygGctg","2508120","2513160"," i'm always looking for is that 30 exactly that 30 minute candle i'm looking for to make sure that"
"T55UeygGctg","2513160","2519560"," it doesn't start breaking below that halfway point of that previous candle yeah or like closing candle"
"T55UeygGctg","2519560","2528760"," below that yeah previous half hour bar and but the thing is is like usually when a high is forming"
"T55UeygGctg","2528760","2538440"," q2 a low is forming q3 and then they will continue on and do a continuation in q4 so um yeah in this"
"T55UeygGctg","2538440","2547160"," case you know i i will think we go down a little bit and then we go retest the highs and if you can"
"T55UeygGctg","2547160","2552760"," go short this is the place where you need to go short from up and then go down"
"T55UeygGctg","2556520","2562360"," yeah they drop them out the same way i do so i always i'm open to both scenarios but once you know"
"T55UeygGctg","2562360","2566600"," the thing is it is one we're not in an area that i want to participate in that i have marked up"
"T55UeygGctg","2566600","2571720"," beforehand even though we did take up the stops and it's a free drive pattern they call it and then"
"T55UeygGctg","2571800","2578680"," you can take a short from here if you're aggressive and where do you go because we broke the structure"
"T55UeygGctg","2578680","2586440"," here you know and we're back below the previous day high and you can see here that we even retested"
"T55UeygGctg","2586440","2594840"," it and rejected it so let's see what they will do so you're looking to break above that tweezer"
"T55UeygGctg","2594840","2600520"," there in that half hour candle to take another long or for the extreme on the look downside right"
"T55UeygGctg","2601400","2609240"," the downside you know the thing is is that i don't like to chase at all you know and like when we're"
"T55UeygGctg","2609240","2614120"," already like this up high and i unless i have a real strong conviction that we're going to go up"
"T55UeygGctg","2615000","2620520"," um i will take it but the risk reward is just not there for me at the moment you know i'll"
"T55UeygGctg","2620520","2625560"," rather wait until tomorrow morning for a setup that i know where i can you know"
"T55UeygGctg","2626200","2631240"," a reference of because like a lot of times around noon you will get the high of the day set"
"T55UeygGctg","2631800","2638600"," in normal i'm like circumstances but like days like today you know when the market is trending in"
"T55UeygGctg","2638600","2645320"," the specific direction and that's when they do break them and yeah and you can take along from"
"T55UeygGctg","2645320","2650920"," here but you know will you get all the juice that you want because i think the move that you did"
"T55UeygGctg","2650920","2656280"," today was impressive already you know it's like from the low to the high we're up already like"
"T55UeygGctg","2658280","2667400"," let's see 56 points yeah it's a good day and i'm wondering too let me switch back over real quick"
"T55UeygGctg","2667800","2669480"," uh let me get back to the"
"T55UeygGctg","2671080","2678600"," along here back to the main screen here i'm going to just switch back to just the your view of your"
"T55UeygGctg","2678600","2686120"," face along here how do you can you stop presenting yeah"
"T55UeygGctg","2686120","2690200"," um we want i just wanted to point out real quick hold on we can put you back on full screen"
"T55UeygGctg","2690200","2695960"," that is yeah what i wanted to point out real quick regarding the quarters is that you"
"T55UeygGctg","2697320","2704120"," you can see that there's this tool it's called um it's name i think let me see what his name is"
"T55UeygGctg","2706920","2712920"," it's called day's quarter theories and i highly suggest you read it up i think i even pin"
"T55UeygGctg","2713400","2720600"," some information on how to use them in the this part but look it up because like if you were"
"T55UeygGctg","2720600","2728520"," able to figure out what happens in q2 which are the red ones as you can see like here this is a low"
"T55UeygGctg","2728520","2746920"," from this area see and regarding the asian sessions just point you out real quick what they did"
"T55UeygGctg","2746920","2753880"," this morning yeah yeah show them the show them the asian session and then the uh london open"
"T55UeygGctg","2753880","2763240"," in the cash market open yeah so this is the asian session and it's quite simple i have this box"
"T55UeygGctg","2763240","2768920"," that gets drawn which ends at midnight new york side the only thing i wait for because you can"
"T55UeygGctg","2768920","2778040"," take both sides straight right um so what do i keep track up the midpoint of it the high and the low"
"T55UeygGctg","2779000","2786520"," and you can see here you know when these stops get taken out which happens at 3 a.m you see"
"T55UeygGctg","2786520","2792920"," yeah i see it over there yeah so they dip it down take out the stops and then they make a double"
"T55UeygGctg","2792920","2798360"," bottom and then you know you get a nice trick like you know be realistic with your expectations because"
"T55UeygGctg","2800600","2806760"," you know anything i target for no no no not at all you know i target the mid and either the high"
"T55UeygGctg","2806840","2811640"," and in this case we didn't even reach the high you know and that was suspicious of me because"
"T55UeygGctg","2812520","2818200"," that's where i pulled the plug because i exited my my calls here and when it started to consolidate"
"T55UeygGctg","2818200","2823400"," like that like you know and that's where your pivots come in right so you're you're as you're"
"T55UeygGctg","2823400","2829800"," using these rules you're still using pivots on the trade whether it whether it goes up to that pivot"
"T55UeygGctg","2829800","2835320"," and then reverses back to the downside gets underneath exactly because i thought we were going to go"
"T55UeygGctg","2835320","2839640"," retest the high of yesterday already yeah you know well which we did but we went"
"T55UeygGctg","2840600","2846760"," i don't know how deep but you know so in the end at the end of the day your thesis is right but"
"T55UeygGctg","2846760","2851080"," you know how do you make it tradable because you know yeah and you got that level down there too"
"T55UeygGctg","2851080","2855400"," that same that same uh they didn't touch that second level down below there that's when i was"
"T55UeygGctg","2855400","2859720"," wondering if they would close that last little level down there but they didn't this one here"
"T55UeygGctg","2860600","2870280"," now the one below you know where i um this one four three five eight five zero the yellow one"
"T55UeygGctg","2870280","2876680"," so the second yellow one down not the top one yeah well if it's bullish you want it to hold here"
"T55UeygGctg","2876680","2882360"," yeah exactly here and i'll show you why because it's fairly it's quite simple where that level"
"T55UeygGctg","2882360","2892280"," comes from on a daily chart you have this inefficiency happening here see here yep you have"
"T55UeygGctg","2892280","2901080"," the high of friday yep and the low of last Tuesday we drop below it and you know because like"
"T55UeygGctg","2902680","2907880"," the gap that we had here also yeah they closed all that gap right there but not this one yeah"
"T55UeygGctg","2908600","2914360"," no exactly so i wanted to keep that level on there because like i was expecting it to be"
"T55UeygGctg","2914360","2920120"," bearish to trade to trade through it you know and then maybe go here at some point you know it's like"
"T55UeygGctg","2920120","2927160"," i'm open to both scenarios always because if this done that because like if we break below here then"
"T55UeygGctg","2927160","2933240"," i'll short it from here you know yeah to go back down here but you know they they my alerts went off"
"T55UeygGctg","2933320","2939960"," and they just well you see where we are now you know yeah exactly they held it and is it is it"
"T55UeygGctg","2939960","2948360"," worth taking the long yeah it is because like if you if you take the long here um you have an entry"
"T55UeygGctg","2948360","2954440"," here yeah that's that sweet sexy down there that's what i want is that yeah and this is the pattern i"
"T55UeygGctg","2954440","2959720"," look for basically so i do not care you know if it touches one of these areas that i already have"
"T55UeygGctg","2959720","2968040"," marked out i mean seeing this happening here like making this low and then breaking this high"
"T55UeygGctg","2968040","2974920"," here that i have here like that yeah yeah yeah tapping that it needs to break it even if it's by"
"T55UeygGctg","2974920","2981880"," one tick one tick dude one fucking tick i don't care and then you know it's it's go time for me because"
"T55UeygGctg","2981880","2985720"," then i'm like i can't wait till it comes back here but you know you also have to have the patience"
"T55UeygGctg","2985720","2991240"," because it takes like 20 minutes for it to get down here but then like this is your long"
"T55UeygGctg","2991240","2998920"," officially yes so at the moment you break that previous that previous high on that huge low it's"
"T55UeygGctg","2998920","3006120"," like it's it's it's on you're off and running yeah and and you know where do i target for it is you"
"T55UeygGctg","3006120","3012920"," know i don't care even if it goes all the way up here i get out here this is where i exit because"
"T55UeygGctg","3013000","3017400"," i have these stops here you see these relatively high i do the same thing i do the same thing"
"T55UeygGctg","3018120","3023080"," and i don't care well and then i have other consequences because like the midnight open"
"T55UeygGctg","3023080","3029640"," that level was at 43.95 which is you know a place that they will always go back to refest it"
"T55UeygGctg","3030840","3036760"," and and they did you know yeah and they did and they went above it and you could have gone short"
"T55UeygGctg","3036760","3043320"," from it even you know to go back to test this this high here and then you know you do whatever"
"T55UeygGctg","3043320","3051480"," you need to do find the buyers still there push it up and yeah even right now um i feel the same"
"T55UeygGctg","3051480","3058120"," way at this moment like just looking at just looking at where we yeah well like could this hold"
"T55UeygGctg","3058120","3064520"," yes do i am i going to take it not unless we get above let me go not not unless we go back above"
"T55UeygGctg","3064520","3067320"," and spy before 37.25"
"T55UeygGctg","3069960","3072680"," but we and we still well hold on let me switch back really quick"
"T55UeygGctg","3077400","3083400"," so even right where we are right now if you're like hey we're gonna we're gonna keep this"
"T55UeygGctg","3083400","3089160"," like Jimmy and i are all talking about this opex and this these like targets upside"
"T55UeygGctg","3089960","3098840"," upside targets for end of uh month right of that 4400 that 45 31 even so David's basically saying"
"T55UeygGctg","3098840","3103960"," like even if you see this previous eye right here right there's basically saying you need to be above"
"T55UeygGctg","3103960","3109320"," this uh to take that continuation trade to get there but otherwise um you're going to be looking"
"T55UeygGctg","3109320","3114680"," for that and it's 12 o'clock in the afternoon right here right so they came in uh two cells"
"T55UeygGctg","3114760","3121800"," 1228 right here but this 12 o'clock we got a failure oh it's right here it's 12 because that's what"
"T55UeygGctg","3121800","3127160"," i was trying to say that's what they did right failure from buyers means they pull push it back"
"T55UeygGctg","3127160","3134760"," down and try to find where that support is right in are those buyers still down here or not so what"
"T55UeygGctg","3134760","3141320"," is David saying sit on your hands here or if i'm if i'm wrong about this David let me know but um"
"T55UeygGctg","3141960","3146920"," so here's your 12 o'clock right there's your failure to find buyers right"
"T55UeygGctg","3148040","3151080"," and then we're gonna come back down if i have this support is actually here"
"T55UeygGctg","3152120","3157800"," we're either going to come down here and trade this uh 434 433 or whatever this 434 93"
"T55UeygGctg","3159000","3164760"," so you don't have a long trade here unless you get back above this um this 437"
"T55UeygGctg","3165640","3169880"," so right now that's the weird thing about it like like you know like the weird thing is i"
"T55UeygGctg","3169880","3175480"," would long this right where we are right right here you belong in it yeah but i i'd be very"
"T55UeygGctg","3176200","3181880"," um i'd be scalping it you know like getting in and getting out and like not having not just for"
"T55UeygGctg","3181880","3186600"," fish let me see what the range is at the moment 4408 like i would target again the previous day"
"T55UeygGctg","3186600","3192360"," high you know and then leave a runner because we have a micro open like knowing that in Q2 which"
"T55UeygGctg","3192360","3200680"," runs between 1223 and 1245 is where a high gets made and that we also have another quarter here"
"T55UeygGctg","3200680","3206520"," where a logo gets made and then we either get a continuation or a reversal however you know"
"T55UeygGctg","3206520","3211240"," this half hour chart man these this half hour bar right here they're still here these buyers"
"T55UeygGctg","3211240","3218040"," are still sitting here in this half hour they have not given it up yet um yeah and and that's"
"T55UeygGctg","3218040","3223480"," the thing and like even though you can like i sculpt these quick things getting in and out"
"T55UeygGctg","3223480","3228680"," there's not it's not much i grab five points and i'm happy with that you know i'm not"
"T55UeygGctg","3229480","3234840"," and that's a half hour chart by the way if you're watching at home let me have a look see what the"
"T55UeygGctg","3234840","3245400"," 30 minute looks like so like for now like we have an hourly close um that we had and i marked this"
"T55UeygGctg","3245880","3252040"," value gap that we have there and i keep an eye on the mid of it but like you know first of all"
"T55UeygGctg","3252040","3257960"," it's a time of day that like i do not like taking lungs in the premium i i wait i rather wait for"
"T55UeygGctg","3257960","3266200"," a discount and for me i'll stay hands off in this case because it met the criteria to me where"
"T55UeygGctg","3266200","3272600"," i'm where it's making a higher noon and and then you know pulling back a bit but you know i'm still"
"T55UeygGctg","3272600","3276520"," in conflict that i think we should go back to those levels that i mentioned earlier on the street"
"T55UeygGctg","3277640","3282200"," so here is the one that says for me to enter so here's the one hour low right here"
"T55UeygGctg","3286920","3291480"," hey well you know what always helps it's like whatever high or low that you have"
"T55UeygGctg","3292280","3299960"," um if it's a 90 minute one or a one hour one just wait for one of them to breach because it will"
"T55UeygGctg","3299960","3306200"," breach one of them no matter what it will always do it to take out stops to take the"
"T55UeygGctg","3306200","3311640"," other side so even if you're bullish and if you're bullish they're going to come over and liquidity"
"T55UeygGctg","3311640","3317880"," break you right yeah down here exactly even if they're going to come back up and so if you're"
"T55UeygGctg","3317880","3325640"," our bearish everyone so if you are bearish here the idea here would be uh let's say blast down"
"T55UeygGctg","3325720","3332440"," through here you're still looking for the rejection on that one hour low if you're going to put on"
"T55UeygGctg","3332440","3338600"," the short so you need to pay close attention to you're going to need to pay close attention to"
"T55UeygGctg","3338600","3346840"," this stop hunt so there's a stop hunt going on right now right and uh yeah and we like to be bullish"
"T55UeygGctg","3346840","3353080"," she's like you can even drop all the way back down to 4400 and then then still go up you know"
"T55UeygGctg","3353080","3360200"," still go it depends yeah um but like for me the more like I always the first thing I do I set my"
"T55UeygGctg","3360200","3369480"," alert in like in this case 4407 I have an alert set 4403 and at 43.98 above that I'm still bullish"
"T55UeygGctg","3369480","3378840"," in that case looking for longs but yeah like the thing is is like I want to see it trade"
"T55UeygGctg","3378840","3386200"," through 4430 to go short and as long as it doesn't do that I'm not taking a short"
"T55UeygGctg","3387000","3392920"," yeah that 4430 even the gamma profiles got some really wonky stuff going on it's got like a"
"T55UeygGctg","3393480","3401240"," it's got that 440 that 44040 and then you know and the and the the best part I mean there are"
"T55UeygGctg","3401240","3408200"," setups there to go short because like there was a fair value gap like let's say from Thursday still"
"T55UeygGctg","3408200","3415240"," that we got into but even there you know we reached the halfway point went above it and I'm like"
"T55UeygGctg","3415240","3421480"," okay it's just not my setup I'm not recognizing it as a short and this is the game and I'm sure there"
"T55UeygGctg","3422280","3427480"," there are people that that trade those models but it's just not mine you know it's uh and that's okay"
"T55UeygGctg","3428680","3434600"," it seems like they're stepping in a little early here to sell that 4400 I got the SPX gamma chart"
"T55UeygGctg","3434600","3439400"," up looks like they're stepping in early but then we've got no stops here and then this"
"T55UeygGctg","3440360","3442920"," 4450 is a big point"
"T55UeygGctg","3444840","3448440"," this one right here and then this one of course is the other big node"
"T55UeygGctg","3449160","3454200"," um this one's kind of like not as big as important as I thought but"
"T55UeygGctg","3454840","3460600"," seems like they want it up there for that for both of these do they do you ever notice that if"
"T55UeygGctg","3460600","3469960"," they want to tag these that will push up pass both and then bounce on top of that 4450 or do you"
"T55UeygGctg","3469960","3479160"," think it's um do they like tick strike it well there is there's no mark what I love what I love"
"T55UeygGctg","3479800","3484920"," what I love to see them do is like create a displacement above those levels so like"
"T55UeygGctg","3486200","3492040"," trade above it through it and then like then you can pull back this gap yeah yeah and then"
"T55UeygGctg","3493080","3499640"," it falls back and then it creates a pullback and sometimes it takes time especially on the"
"T55UeygGctg","3499640","3505000"," hard time frame you need to be patient because it doesn't show up until a specific time of day"
"T55UeygGctg","3505000","3513960"," for example you know so a lot of it yeah so I just wait because I can this case I'm just going"
"T55UeygGctg","3513960","3523320"," to wait between eight o'clock my time which is I think to your time yeah and I'm gonna wait for"
"T55UeygGctg","3523320","3530520"," yourself a bullet to show up and then I'll trade off that because that's where they then we'll"
"T55UeygGctg","3530520","3536840"," move the market again from but like I don't know we'll see where we are so one of the points"
"T55UeygGctg","3536840","3543160"," that's where they are one of the points David is bringing up is um taking out stops here right in"
"T55UeygGctg","3543160","3551960"," this one hour low it's not necessarily bearish um but you as a trader if you're if you're a trader"
"T55UeygGctg","3551960","3558760"," and you're trying to trade this right here right uh the thesis here is uh don't get trapped in"
"T55UeygGctg","3558760","3567080"," hold on a second here you don't want to get or not I shouldn't say trap but here"
"T55UeygGctg","3568840","3573480"," don't get too bearish yet yeah you don't want to get too bearish yet if you're if you want to get"
"T55UeygGctg","3573480","3578600"," bearish you can but what you're looking for here is a bear is if you have the bloodbath down right"
"T55UeygGctg","3578680","3583320"," you grab people stops here right the big fat red candle down and it looks super bearish"
"T55UeygGctg","3584040","3592200"," what you're really looking for is um from that capitulation uh whatever this green candle is"
"T55UeygGctg","3592200","3600360"," this green candle fail on that one hour low if that does fail you can begin to get bearish you"
"T55UeygGctg","3600360","3607400"," can set up the short trade or the long put trade uh to then take these candles down but if this"
"T55UeygGctg","3607400","3618680"," candle on this on this uh on this uh stop on tear if this green candle recovers to the upside then"
"T55UeygGctg","3618680","3626040"," that puts you into the um into the finger trap right into dead load in the middle and you can see"
"T55UeygGctg","3626040","3632440"," this failure candle right here was bought right back up and demand is pushing us higher right you"
"T55UeygGctg","3632440","3639320"," still don't buy this you wait because this green candle is positive right but it you don't want"
"T55UeygGctg","3639320","3646280"," to get caught in this shit either so this is actually more bullish or neutral uh but if you do get"
"T55UeygGctg","3646280","3652120"," the break above and that's the higher looking for you'd squeeze you'd trade that right there"
"T55UeygGctg","3652120","3656280"," and then you get the reversal on the on the white and red here that white would turn"
"T55UeygGctg","3657240","3661480"," and uh you'd get the red back to the upside you'd have the the bear trap right there"
"T55UeygGctg","3662040","3667240"," um so you're just kind of sitting on your hands in here bullish or bearish this price action"
"T55UeygGctg","3667240","3672360"," you don't fuck with you just kind of sit here and let it play out is that right or wrong David I"
"T55UeygGctg","3672360","3679240"," get that wrong or if you want to ask or say um or betterly describe what you're anticipating"
"T55UeygGctg","3679240","3685240"," from it you know make I am is there a trade here for you long or short right now where price is"
"T55UeygGctg","3686440","3691080"," yeah I just went into some 40-50 calls he dirty dog"
"T55UeygGctg","3693720","3698600"," I couldn't resist I've already started to scale like me early like I am always early too"
"T55UeygGctg","3700120","3706040"," hold on I'll join you hold on a second here no way way way be careful I'm skilled I had 50 I"
"T55UeygGctg","3706040","3711160"," wait for this bottom to hit and then I had 57 only gonna do 10 let us think"
"T55UeygGctg","3711160","3720760"," that's so that's all right we're gonna already have three contracts"
"T55UeygGctg","3722440","3726680"," well you know I just like to see these premiums because when they drop like two bucks you know"
"T55UeygGctg","3726680","3734040"," I just grabbed them because they dropped them down to 1250 and then you know come on uh 438"
"T55UeygGctg","3734040","3739400"," let's see we'll see what it does 43 70s"
"T55UeygGctg","3744040","3749480"," you was wondering the other day you know it's like it's a good like this is the kind of thing"
"T55UeygGctg","3749480","3755000"," here where I'm looking at it right now and I'm like yeah it's we're either going the"
"T55UeygGctg","3755000","3760200"," we're either going up here or if we start to roll I'll fucking stop myself out down here so"
"T55UeygGctg","3761000","3768280"," um this is the place to put some put some some kind of some kind of uh risk on"
"T55UeygGctg","3769000","3773960"," yeah but it's like like you know even if it goes against it still it's still the place it's still"
"T55UeygGctg","3773960","3781640"," the place so this previous little right here and that's the thing because like if you if you"
"T55UeygGctg","3781640","3787960"," try to take longs at the high there's no point dude there's no point I don't do it"
"T55UeygGctg","3788840","3794840"," and like in this case you know we had our high in Q2 what I say um you know which which I always"
"T55UeygGctg","3794840","3801320"," expect around 12 between 12 and 1230 the second 90 when the minute window that I play with where"
"T55UeygGctg","3801320","3806840"," they're going to retest the 90 minute highs and the lows yeah and I just trade that"
"T55UeygGctg","3808680","3815160"," yeah and it's one 12 right now like so it's system that similar system more not as complex but"
"T55UeygGctg","3815800","3818520"," like it's one o'clock right now like in my view right here"
"T55UeygGctg","3819720","3823960"," like they got a bulls basically have a half an hour in my view like they you're given the half"
"T55UeygGctg","3823960","3829400"," an hour from one to 130 and then 130 to me is going to be the critical they're basically"
"T55UeygGctg","3829400","3834120"," giving it from like from right now until 130 the bulls are going to be given that last chance"
"T55UeygGctg","3834120","3839720"," if they can't turn this shit on in this half an hour then that 130 will get owned by the sellers"
"T55UeygGctg","3839720","3844920"," and that we will send it to the depths of health so oh yeah because I've seen that happen too you"
"T55UeygGctg","3844920","3849880"," know where I was I got fever bullish and then all of a sudden I thought you know I'm buying the dip"
"T55UeygGctg","3849880","3854920"," and this kind of shit and then all of a sudden it just goes against me and in those premiums"
"T55UeygGctg","3854920","3861480"," sometimes it's like it's a shit because you can't get out you know it's like yeah like this"
"T55UeygGctg","3861480","3867000"," it's like you already lost like 30 percent and then like I should have had standing at future"
"T55UeygGctg","3867000","3872040"," short or something like that I always look for those 30 minutes because like whatever on that 30"
"T55UeygGctg","3872040","3880360"," minute I'm always like it's I always notice that you're getting like a like a you're getting a new"
"T55UeygGctg","3880360","3884760"," low off that previous lower a new high on off that previous high in those 30 minutes"
"T55UeygGctg","3885960","3893080"," yeah and if you fail to get those look up for the other side right so right now this next half an hour"
"T55UeygGctg","3894680","3901640"," simplifying this between now and 130 it's 114 right now right so like a seller must"
"T55UeygGctg","3902040","3909080"," is required to get a new low from over here so this this this red candle right here"
"T55UeygGctg","3909080","3915080"," they have about if they have 16 minutes to create a new low situation so if they don't get it and"
"T55UeygGctg","3915080","3921560"," close underneath we'll go up if they do get it it's it's usually pretty fucking bearish"
"T55UeygGctg","3923160","3926840"," we'll see that we'll see that preview that known support down below here"
"T55UeygGctg","3927560","3936280"," all this stuff here 434 434 93 33 and they're trying right now they're trying to try and"
"T55UeygGctg","3936280","3941960"," to sell sell us out right now I'm still long here by the way I need to see I need to see that"
"T55UeygGctg","3941960","3951000"," failure of that green candle so let me end up I'm still long here I need to see that fucking failure"
"T55UeygGctg","3951000","3961640"," let me see it you know the thing is that it's um I don't know I'm not supposed to trade patterns"
"T55UeygGctg","3961640","3967960"," and stuff like that but then I see it flag like this and you just have to wait and and so that"
"T55UeygGctg","3967960","3972440"," reaches a specific level because like for me it's quite simple you know I tried a true week open"
"T55UeygGctg","3972440","3978920"," which is 4406 where I tried to log it it jumped up I got out you know I'm I'm skilled so it doesn't"
"T55UeygGctg","3978920","3984520"," matter if it goes against me I already bought my stop you know so and that's the thing because if"
"T55UeygGctg","3984520","3989000"," you if you it doesn't matter where you get in but if you already have your levels planned where you"
"T55UeygGctg","3989000","3997640"," could um where you're able to scale then you can have that buffer if it goes against you to get"
"T55UeygGctg","3997640","4004360"," out even if it goes further than what your stop was and that is what really changed everything"
"T55UeygGctg","4004440","4010520"," that I did um is the scaling part you know in the first two three points as soon as I get it"
"T55UeygGctg","4011640","4017240"," I take about a third off or whatever I do it doesn't matter if you're trading microbes and if you if"
"T55UeygGctg","4017240","4022760"," you can't do the big ones do it with the microbes learn it on there if you're not willing to take"
"T55UeygGctg","4022760","4030760"," the 50 bucks risk on it then you shouldn't be trading at all and you know I think that is"
"T55UeygGctg","4030760","4036920"," once you see the dynamic on what scaling does to you and your theoretical average for example to"
"T55UeygGctg","4036920","4044440"," your position um it gives you a breeding room to have a little tolerance to give it more room"
"T55UeygGctg","4044440","4050360"," to do specific things they were parked right here right now there's a little bit more down there"
"T55UeygGctg","4050840","4055480"," not much market down there so"
"T55UeygGctg","4060280","4064200"," uh VIX bouncing really quickly let me just give you a quick market update to people"
"T55UeygGctg","4064200","4069400"," you get a large reversal on HYG to the downside off their six EMA and the one-hour trigger"
"T55UeygGctg","4069400","4073640"," going HYG going back down to retest those previous lows from this morning"
"T55UeygGctg","4073800","4082440"," VIX parking itself up on the 27 EMA in a five-minute chart trying to hold that 27 EMA to go up"
"T55UeygGctg","4083160","4090920"," that's looking pretty pretty bearish right now on SPX with that VIX counts Dixie is extremely"
"T55UeygGctg","4091800","4099720"," bullish right now apple reversing on a one-minute chart below the the 27 EMA Tesla testing it's"
"T55UeygGctg","4099720","4108040"," 27 EMA NASDAQ testing it's 27 EMA right now so um mixed bag right here VIX and Dixie telling"
"T55UeygGctg","4108040","4114040"," you to expect a roll and right now you see this pull up right here this this green candle right"
"T55UeygGctg","4114040","4119080"," here and this failure this is probably going to result in a down move so I'm going to end up"
"T55UeygGctg","4119080","4126040"," taking a should have taken I should have actually taken the um should have got taken my stops right"
"T55UeygGctg","4126120","4131080"," here so right there should have taken my stops so I'm still long right now I'm going to try to get"
"T55UeygGctg","4131080","4135320"," out here and just a minute unless we do get this roll down to the net downside we're likely going"
"T55UeygGctg","4135320","4144360"," to get it target to the downside four thirty five fifty eight uh four spoons here and this is just"
"T55UeygGctg","4144360","4149960"," based on Dixie the word Dixie's heading right now and then VIX I'm still long right here so I'm"
"T55UeygGctg","4150040","4155880"," just looking for an exit at this point but that's weird because like this morning um"
"T55UeygGctg","4156520","4163720"," dollar wasn't moving and and like against the market whatsoever which was uh"
"T55UeygGctg","4164360","4170520"," applied to me that's why I stayed out um as open there is there's some spunkiness here there could"
"T55UeygGctg","4170520","4177480"," be like even if we do roll it could be something where it's like down and then immediately straight"
"T55UeygGctg","4177480","4183160"," up so I'm looking at uh yeah Apple's got 177 then it's going to be looking for a bounce"
"T55UeygGctg","4184120","4189480"," um so if they do reject this and it's if they do reject this and send this lower there could"
"T55UeygGctg","4189480","4194360"," be still be a dip buy in there but I'm still long right now having sold and you know it's more"
"T55UeygGctg","4194360","4200840"," even more fucked up is um I'm still sitting on these fucking calls and I'm being giving a chance"
"T55UeygGctg","4201480","4207880"," you got the bear cross forming up here right now it's not quite there but you guys see that"
"T55UeygGctg","4207880","4214680"," I'm also still in that I still have one one we do yeah yeah I have a love here too"
"T55UeygGctg","4214680","4220600"," 255 at the moment and they're trading 22 so I'm still green on them weirdly enough you know it's"
"T55UeygGctg","4220600","4225560"," like like so right here there's a there's a bear cross coming up but even so like"
"T55UeygGctg","4226040","4231880"," like timing of closing when you're when you're wrong I'm like just give me that one bar right"
"T55UeygGctg","4231880","4237720"," there before they reverse it just give me that one squeeze you see I think I can get out of 23"
"T55UeygGctg","4237720","4245080"," I think I got a I got a chance to get out here"

"T55UeygGctg","4257240","4263960"," and then come back down but you know uh I'm good right here I'm good we're gonna see what happens"
"T55UeygGctg","4263960","4269160"," here and try to rain it down on us right now I'm still long too I shouldn't be I get yelled at"
"T55UeygGctg","4269160","4272200"," and scream for this by the way"
"T55UeygGctg","4275480","4278280"," let me uh let me ask you guys in the chat right now"
"T55UeygGctg","4280200","4285000"," um let me ask you in the chat if you have any questions for David do you want to ask"
"T55UeygGctg","4285000","4289400"," him any questions in the chat or if you already have asked David any questions if you could"
"T55UeygGctg","4289400","4294840"," repeat them I don't have a producer reading the questions in the background right now but if you"
"T55UeygGctg","4294840","4300680"," could uh ask hey buddy then I'll be honest David that my"
"T55UeygGctg","4301880","4307720"," bot is still long here so until we get that cross yeah dude till we until that fucking bot"
"T55UeygGctg","4307720","4313800"," turns red I'm still long so I'm I'm down with it yeah I need to I need to because like what I"
"T55UeygGctg","4313800","4319800"," last week I think it was somewhere um I have the triggers oh my trading too and I was looking at"
"T55UeygGctg","4319960","4326280"," but um I just like that little box right off of it that little box that's like long short long"
"T55UeygGctg","4326280","4332280"," short I'm like what am I trying to do I'm least using at least at a minimum I use it as like a"
"T55UeygGctg","4332280","4337720"," uh should I be getting long getting out of a long is it telling me here to get out"
"T55UeygGctg","4338520","4343240"," it's telling me I can see you long because I need to I need to learn a little bit more about"
"T55UeygGctg","4343240","4349480"," those crossovers what what happens or what to expect when that happens because I was I was I was"
"T55UeygGctg","4349480","4356920"," looking at um the past and I saw something change yeah I've got two uh flipped on the chart"
"T55UeygGctg","4356920","4364520"," so I've got two different uh alerts on there I've got one alert that writes uh uh bullish or bearish"
"T55UeygGctg","4364520","4373640"," or something like that and they're right and that one is that it was the first time in um"
"T55UeygGctg","4374520","4378680"," you have a look to see that something was crossing over"
"T55UeygGctg","4380920","4386840"," now it's happened for a long time now I've got some questions for you too as you're looking"
"T55UeygGctg","4386840","4392760"," right now uh people are asking questions in the chat so I'm going to ask um uh what am I only"
"T55UeygGctg","4392760","4396760"," wait here for you to get let's get through what you're talking about here or maybe we revisit the"
"T55UeygGctg","4396760","4402760"," bullish bearish crossovers in the box at some point maybe I'm leading you down uh a tangent"
"T55UeygGctg","4402760","4406680"," rather I'm asking people to ask questions then I'm leading you off on a tangent"
"T55UeygGctg","4407560","4410440"," all right i'll raise go ahead uh let me see here"
"T55UeygGctg","4412680","4421560"," sywecg said david what are you trading es me s or spx uh two days out question mark"
"T55UeygGctg","4422440","4427240"," uh at the money question mark where what your delt is on them what your uh expo expo expo"
"T55UeygGctg","4427240","4433160"," exporations oh i only trade the option that is where spx flows on the previous day"
"T55UeygGctg","4435240","4438840"," so you're only trading the options where spx closed on the previous day"
"T55UeygGctg","4440040","4445160"," yeah uh what else we got for questions i don't look at deltas whatsoever i'll wait for the premiums"
"T55UeygGctg","4445160","4451320"," to get cheap no yeah i i look at deltas but i don't that's not a decision maker for me it's when"
"T55UeygGctg","4451320","4457800"," the premiums get cheap i do something similar to you is i track where the opening lows or highs"
"T55UeygGctg","4457800","4462360"," on those options are and then i know if we're going up that's where everybody's in or basically"
"T55UeygGctg","4462360","4466920"," the algos are in at that low and they keep going back to that low and sometimes they grind the"
"T55UeygGctg","4466920","4473400"," theta off yeah theta grind though that option as the day progresses and what i do keep track"
"T55UeygGctg","4473400","4478360"," up is where they closed them up on the previous day so for example it doesn't matter what option"
"T55UeygGctg","4478360","4486360"," price i use because i think you can determine it based on i don't know i guess if you go further"
"T55UeygGctg","4486360","4492920"," out of money then you you'd have a little bit of a problem i think yeah in the past i started with"
"T55UeygGctg","4492920","4501400"," 30 deltas and then i noticed that like if it goes against you it goes against you fast and like if"
"T55UeygGctg","4501400","4511160"," i'm really convinced about um like we're going a certain direction um for example like where we"
"T55UeygGctg","4511160","4520360"," bounce today um i would have probably taken a call further into money if not completely in the money"
"T55UeygGctg","4520440","4530280"," maybe and then the day out the uh the unspy what's fascinating to me not"
"T55UeygGctg","4530280","4538920"," fascinating but unspy what's fascinating to me is the um anything that's above like 30 delta i can"
"T55UeygGctg","4538920","4547560"," usually get some recovery uh but anything above that like the 40s 50s 60s 70s they're like highly"
"T55UeygGctg","4547640","4552600"," directional with like one dates two dates like you're in for the direction only if you caught the"
"T55UeygGctg","4552600","4563320"," right direction only and not the um uh like i guess i should say like so if i'm buying like a 30 or"
"T55UeygGctg","4563320","4570600"," closer delta like 30s 20s 10s or in the money let's say i buy it at that like let's say let's say a 30"
"T55UeygGctg","4570680","4576600"," delta call opens at the 10 cents it tends to hold that 10 cents if we're directly heading up"
"T55UeygGctg","4577480","4583880"," all day long if i don't it's like a 40 50 delta was like a three cent or two cent or a five cent"
"T55UeygGctg","4583880","4589400"," i'm not using the best example here but uh they'll still they'll grind way farther down than that"
"T55UeygGctg","4589400","4594120"," five or seven cents it would have like instead of cutting back to bounce off seven or bounce off"
"T55UeygGctg","4594120","4600200"," 10 or bounce off 12 it still stays it like still blasts down i'm using the wrong numbers here but"
"T55UeygGctg","4600920","4604200"," um like still blasts but it takes zero at some point by the end of the day"
"T55UeygGctg","4605720","4612840"," because like if i if i have a conviction then it's going to go to a specific level um like intrinsic"
"T55UeygGctg","4612840","4617880"," value stays with the closer delta's on zero and one day it's the better way to explain that"
"T55UeygGctg","4618840","4625880"," and now i the last few weeks i've been looking a lot at the volume you know also a little bit"
"T55UeygGctg","4626680","4631560"," because they need to be liquid especially in spx you can have a little problem with getting"
"T55UeygGctg","4631560","4638920"," them filled and since i chart those options and if i don't have the right chart settings on there"
"T55UeygGctg","4638920","4643400"," it will not show me a single candle for example so i need to switch over to the midpoint when as"
"T55UeygGctg","4643400","4650120"," soon as i do not see those candles trading on that strike price i a lot of times stay out of that"
"T55UeygGctg","4650120","4656600"," one and then i look for one that is a bit more um with a bit more volume for example"
"T55UeygGctg","4658680","4665880"," i'm always looking for the um the concentration of calls and puts on on each strike and then i'm"
"T55UeygGctg","4665880","4673320"," always looking at um yeah i think maybe basically that's where like where they all positioned right"
"T55UeygGctg","4673320","4680680"," and yeah that's that's where the magnets are right it's always where all the puts are where all the"
"T55UeygGctg","4680680","4690200"," calls are um someone's asking here they're saying uh this is from goat boy 1989 he says uh"
"T55UeygGctg","4690200","4697960"," david and cap do you believe it's important for us uh as a retailer to think or quote unquote believe"
"T55UeygGctg","4698520","4704840"," that the market is controlled algorithmically we've just been uh we've just been sold that it's"
"T55UeygGctg","4704840","4709480"," a buying and selling dynamic i don't believe this goat boy saying he doesn't believe that it's"
"T55UeygGctg","4709480","4712760"," buying and saying you you and i talked about this friday right that we don't believe the real"
"T55UeygGctg","4712760","4719160"," pricing in the market is real oh no fuck no uh i think the classic ta books and like i've sold"
"T55UeygGctg","4719160","4725720"," the side added to manipulate the masses uh like how like the market loses a trillion in a day"
"T55UeygGctg","4725720","4732200"," or fifty five billion dollars and fifteen minutes like uh nomad the liquidity gets put in by the"
"T55UeygGctg","4732200","4740360"," central bank every day every day every day liquidity gets injected between two p.m. and eight p.m."
"T55UeygGctg","4742200","4747640"," well i came a bit late so i didn't catch being so i don't uh didn't tell your story here's trade"
"T55UeygGctg","4747640","4752600"," and how long we trade yeah we've already told that story i'll put together this um so bear"
"T55UeygGctg","4752600","4760840"," town sheriff we're gonna we're gonna put together a um i'll put them together montage or we'll cut"
"T55UeygGctg","4760840","4765160"," the video the interview down to where i'm like i don't know what i'm talking about here i'm making"
"T55UeygGctg","4765160","4771720"," a bad example but i'm i really mean this uh like intrinsic value you know what i suggest what we"
"T55UeygGctg","4771800","4779560"," could do is um we'll put the interview maybe tomorrow or on thursday um i can get on stream and then"
"T55UeygGctg","4779560","4786440"," you know when the golden nugget set up and folds and and just you know walk everyone through if"
"T55UeygGctg","4786440","4792280"," the ingredients are there that we would take it like in this case it was a short also you know but"
"T55UeygGctg","4793160","4800920"," um yeah i don't like it when it's being done in in the way of where we already are right now does"
"T55UeygGctg","4800920","4807640"," mean anything and then yeah so and even though it works because every single day it works you"
"T55UeygGctg","4807640","4812680"," know it shows up in in what kind of form it doesn't matter because sometimes you will get"
"T55UeygGctg","4812680","4817800"," five points sometimes you get ten points i mean even in this case i think how many points did it"
"T55UeygGctg","4817800","4827960"," give you when from 23 down to oh seven so well yeah david and i talked about friday about um"
"T55UeygGctg","4828040","4832600"," i'm gonna spend some time with him he's gonna spend some time with me put me through the"
"T55UeygGctg","4832600","4838440"," combine and then we're gonna try to get him on the air uh maybe just stop in and maybe make some"

"T55UeygGctg","4843960","4848920"," another we see what else we have it um david how are your liquidity zones identified"
"T55UeygGctg","4850520","4854440"," the reason swing high and uh do you want to show an example of it if we if you"

"T55UeygGctg","4885560","4892440"," here and i had to go to the vet with my cat because she's like has been in diarrhea for like three"
"T55UeygGctg","4892440","4899080"," months now oh no three years by the way yeah it's stuck she just shits over the floor everywhere"
"T55UeygGctg","4899080","4904840"," it's some of my entire fucking house smells like shit sometimes our uh oh well our our animals"
"T55UeygGctg","4905800","4909640"," have you like i i noticed that animals are expensive like"
"T55UeygGctg","4910600","4917160"," yeah they are you know here in europe it's even it's crazy you know it's like you go to the"
"T55UeygGctg","4917160","4922840"," for like 15 minutes you get one shot and you're yeah it costs like 80 bucks but i get more pleasure"
"T55UeygGctg","4922840","4927320"," from it so i don't care so it's fine let me know when you want to share your screen and i'll put"
"T55UeygGctg","4927400","4933640"," you on full screen here yeah okay cool uh i'll have to share the window"
"T55UeygGctg","4937240","4938680"," um hold on one second"
"T55UeygGctg","4941320","4942760"," let me start off with a clean chart"
"T55UeygGctg","4946680","4953000"," okay all right i gotcha i like the white and a green candles too by the way i use i used to use"
"T55UeygGctg","4953000","4959000"," red and white i like them you can um you can use my template if you want i'll share it to you and"
"T55UeygGctg","4959000","4963160"," then you can just save it and then um can you just try to push it down right now it's the pivot"
"T55UeygGctg","4969720","4975000"," you see bulls one lost a half an hour on 130 we immediately started selling down now trading"
"T55UeygGctg","4975320","4978280"," four 35 64 here"
"T55UeygGctg","4981080","4982440"," 132 in the afternoon"
"T55UeygGctg","4989720","4997000"," so like when i start off the day that's quite simple i look for the previous day high and low"
"T55UeygGctg","4997000","5000040"," and one of them will be taken out that's it"
"T55UeygGctg","5000840","5008920"," so in this case here i had a fair value gap there because we have this weekly opening gap that it's"
"T55UeygGctg","5008920","5018440"," still open because we basically gapped and go on sunday uh on sunday we never touched it and that"
"T55UeygGctg","5018440","5024360"," that zone i don't know we might revisit it later in the week or maybe you know sell off this week i"
"T55UeygGctg","5024360","5028680"," don't know i hope it would be your visit this morning but they left it and when i took out the"
"T55UeygGctg","5029240","5035240"," other side of it yeah yeah because what they basically tested was the low from last Tuesday"
"T55UeygGctg","5039320","5045560"," did that answer your huda who asked that question here so that's why i had that 43 66 mark down there"
"T55UeygGctg","5046280","5049480"," and do you mark the previous week size and lows as well or no"
"T55UeygGctg","5050440","5054040"," yes areas of interest as well let me too yeah yeah definitely"
"T55UeygGctg","5054840","5062360"," and because like there's a setup they call it like an order block it could be in development but"
"T55UeygGctg","5062360","5069320"," it's going to take a day or two for it to pan out or not and it did break through it where i have"
"T55UeygGctg","5069320","5077560"," my levels that i wanted to take it but yeah we'll see what what we'll get but i look at the previous"
"T55UeygGctg","5077560","5082440"," day high and low and one of them will always get taken out unless there's an inside day but those"
"T55UeygGctg","5082520","5087960"," are rare so and that's where i take the short order long from always"
"T55UeygGctg","5089400","5095320"," now when you're finding those when you're finding those liquidity zones the up and down"
"T55UeygGctg","5095320","5102840"," side are you trying to um trade off those if it bounces on the bottom side of that"
"T55UeygGctg","5102840","5107320"," liquidity zone you're trying to trade off those and then trying to sell the top of that liquidity"
"T55UeygGctg","5107320","5111720"," zone and then if you break above and below you'll take your stops and trade that yeah like the"
"T55UeygGctg","5111800","5116600"," setup that i showed you on the on the one minute chart um like this"
"T55UeygGctg","5121000","5131160"," what you see happening here this pattern in this area yep i'm looking i like that and even if"
"T55UeygGctg","5131160","5139320"," it's a short or low you know i'm just inversing the chart but you know look the thing is is like"
"T55UeygGctg","5139320","5142680"," what do you see up here it's the same thing you know"
"T55UeygGctg","5144920","5152680"," every city it's go back here it almost looks like the low that we had this morning see"
"T55UeygGctg","5152680","5155320"," now they bounced off the pivot just then at that moment here"
"T55UeygGctg","5157160","5162680"," and you said that this was manipulation day right so you're seeing the manipulation today the grind"
"T55UeygGctg","5162760","5167080"," and yeah yeah and they're going to distribute until tomorrow"
"T55UeygGctg","5169320","5174200"," yeah that's what we were talking about the we were talking about uh we got Biden tomorrow"
"T55UeygGctg","5176680","5182520"," ostensibly having an interview in Israel and then Thursday we've got"

"T55UeygGctg","5189880","5195880"," um but i always find tuesday is as the most fascinating day of the week right"
"T55UeygGctg","5196520","5203880"," um well yeah a lot of times uh it will form a high or a low of the week you know yeah on tuesday"
"T55UeygGctg","5203880","5211080"," is absolutely yeah so and then on thursday you can have the reversal but you know friday for"
"T55UeygGctg","5211080","5215400"," example in the quarter's theory it doesn't it doesn't pick that into account however the"
"T55UeygGctg","5215480","5222440"," micros you can trade because it's you know it's it's basically your discount whatever happens on"
"T55UeygGctg","5222440","5230120"," friday let me see here if i can see what uh i read some of the questions here from youtube here"
"T55UeygGctg","5230120","5239160"," i'm going to go through youtube really quick thank you so here was your answer short"

"T55UeygGctg","5498840","5506600"," profitable i think it took like two and a half years or three years yeah did you have any success"
"T55UeygGctg","5506600","5512760"," immediately out the gate and then some losses then success or yeah yeah i had a lot of success"
"T55UeygGctg","5512760","5517640"," but it wasn't really that hard because like when i started paper trading and it wasn't doing"
"T55UeygGctg","5517640","5525000"," that well then i really started to buy the dips during covid and when everything was locked up"
"T55UeygGctg","5525000","5530600"," you know so but that wasn't that hard because like i mean we had these wild"
"T55UeygGctg","5530600","5533160"," still buying the dip here i just nodded about this by the way"
"T55UeygGctg","5534120","5539400"," had no fucking clue what i was doing like you know it was just just logging the market every"
"T55UeygGctg","5539480","5546680"," single day you know it's like yeah and and it just didn't stop so and then like sometimes"
"T55UeygGctg","5546680","5551800"," you would get these huge dips and then like i would freak out but i would also have like heavy"
"T55UeygGctg","5551800","5557880"," losses like you know i would also like i think my biggest loss was like thirty eight thousand"
"T55UeygGctg","5557880","5563400"," dollars or something like that and one day what about the fucking loss that you took on the um"
"T55UeygGctg","5563400","5569400"," bullshit with the the broker's being down yeah that's what i'm talking about but that's that loss"
"T55UeygGctg","5569400","5578040"," yeah yeah and that affected me for like almost a year and you never got paid back for that did you"
"T55UeygGctg","5579000","5589560"," no no but yeah i earned it back like so it doesn't it's weird because it's like it was part of the"
"T55UeygGctg","5589640","5595640"," system fault that was causing this but then again it was also recklessness on my behalf"
"T55UeygGctg","5595640","5605880"," by not managing my stops properly so i i don't have anyone else to blame them myself to be honest"
"T55UeygGctg","5605880","5610840"," in the end because i'm the one that presses the buy button you know even though it was a system"
"T55UeygGctg","5610840","5616120"," error there were ways to get out of it somehow and i just was a bit more passive than it"
"T55UeygGctg","5616760","5626120"," into um not taking the initiative and and sniping that shit up you know yeah some of my largest"
"T55UeygGctg","5626120","5635480"," losses i've ever incurred were uh knowing i should have taken a stop and run and not yeah taking not"
"T55UeygGctg","5635480","5640840"," taking that stop uh i don't do that like more but on the big trades i don't do that i do i'll"
"T55UeygGctg","5640840","5646280"," fuck around with zero dates here and be like this is my goddamn conviction or you've taken away"
"T55UeygGctg","5646280","5651000"," 30 or 75 percent of the trade it might as well just stay in it or leave it in the pile of"
"T55UeygGctg","5651000","5657960"," shit that's burned um but those large trades man like i just i see them as stops like basically"
"T55UeygGctg","5657960","5664120"," it's like i'm buying them but um i don't care if they go to zero because like i like in my mind"
"T55UeygGctg","5664120","5670600"," whenever i enter an option trade that amount that i have put in even though i i am planning to put"
"T55UeygGctg","5670600","5679880"," in the stop on it to limit the loss but i'd basically count that option as like um something"
"T55UeygGctg","5679880","5686200"," i can lose all from because like and for example let's say a bomb goes off or something like that"
"T55UeygGctg","5686200","5691480"," right yeah there's no way your stop is going to get hit and you're never going to get that premium"
"T55UeygGctg","5691480","5702280"," back yeah so in my mind even though i'm able to take a stop on it um there's always in the back"
"T55UeygGctg","5702280","5708680"," of my mind knowing that like something could go against me in that trade where i i lose that"
"T55UeygGctg","5708680","5715240"," entire premium so that's why i never risk a specific percentage of my portfolio on on any trade"
"T55UeygGctg","5716200","5726840"," to limit that so um i do so i do place significantly size trades against my account but it's it's like"
"T55UeygGctg","5727960","5734280"," six five to ten times a year post like say five to ten times a year i do put risk on yeah but i"
"T55UeygGctg","5734280","5738920"," i used to what i used to do in those trades is i would if it started to go against me i would stay"
"T55UeygGctg","5739000","5745240"," in it and i would i wouldn't quite blow up my accounts but fucking pretty fucking bad so"
"T55UeygGctg","5746280","5750360"," um i wish i was able to stop i do put stops on these trades what's that"
"T55UeygGctg","5751640","5758280"," i wish i was going to be like some someday i really hope to be able to be so aggressive in that sense"
"T55UeygGctg","5758280","5765960"," to hutch them out immediately yeah with futures but the thing is is that with spx you have to calculate"
"T55UeygGctg","5765960","5773640"," every dollar amount like i don't know i'm stupid man it's like i could care less like"
"T55UeygGctg","5774360","5779000"," what the amount is i just want the direction right and if my stop gets hit it gets hit"
"T55UeygGctg","5779960","5784760"," and i don't want to be thinking about like how many i'm in a futures contract i need to to hutch"
"T55UeygGctg","5786360","5790600"," do you feel like you're more disciplined with larger trades or less disciplined"
"T55UeygGctg","5790600","5796520"," i feel like i'm less disciplined with smaller trades and way more disciplined with larger trades"
"T55UeygGctg","5798680","5808600"," more challenging i have the same emotion that i have with trading micros like"
"T55UeygGctg","5810360","5813320"," sometimes i could like if i'm i'm unsure about"
"T55UeygGctg","5813400","5821240"," my position or my direction i sometimes revert back to the micros for example take a position"
"T55UeygGctg","5821240","5828440"," and if i even if it's like a ten buck loss it still bugs me like i can't stand seeing the red"
"T55UeygGctg","5828440","5835320"," on my p&l and i know it's part of the game and you know but yeah that's part of what you do to"

"T55UeygGctg","5867960","5875240"," i'll wait like for the fucking entire day where i set up to unfold where i know it will do"
"T55UeygGctg","5875240","5880200"," whatever i think it will do and i will recover that loss"
"T55UeygGctg","5882680","5887640"," and i know it will come if you watch out down below we have some more supply or some demand"

"T55UeygGctg","6154600","6160440"," high and low of the day and then i just try that and because like anyone that is trying to"
"T55UeygGctg","6160440","6167560"," predict to see what it's going to be like in the year it's probably going to be wrong yeah it's"
"T55UeygGctg","6167560","6173480"," like seasonality works and does well it works and does like a whole time frame works great no matter"
"T55UeygGctg","6173480","6179960"," what it works great you know i see that it works um but i've been only paying attention to that"
"T55UeygGctg","6180040","6184600"," to it since about six months or so and before that i wasn't using it at all"
"T55UeygGctg","6185560","6193240"," so for me it's it's still new and and so far the way i've interpreted it it's working flawlessly"
"T55UeygGctg","6193240","6201160"," so i like fuck i should have saw one much earlier you know i saw the one decline i mean it were it"
"T55UeygGctg","6201160","6206280"," works i've got it sitting up from on my end right now and i'm looking at it and it's still showing"
"T55UeygGctg","6207160","6214600"," it's showing right now that uh that push up into the end of the week um into this end of the week"
"T55UeygGctg","6214600","6219960"," but then we get a new low coming into next week and another low and another i think like the next"
"T55UeygGctg","6219960","6226200"," 12 days is like sidewalk or like so and i should say after friday should be sideways and down"
"T55UeygGctg","6226200","6233080"," consolidating for a larger move see what you got here um let me show it to you let me show everybody"
"T55UeygGctg","6233080","6238280"," out there okay"
"T55UeygGctg","6242840","6247240"," so we're looking for a reversal continuation in this quarter up until year end right"
"T55UeygGctg","6247960","6254680"," so um and then at the discord i i i pointed out that from the second of"
"T55UeygGctg","6254680","6261080"," of october until the 13th of october i'm looking for a low to form in that window right so and for"
"T55UeygGctg","6261160","6267080"," me the limit was around the 13th of october because you can see the gray lines the red lines the"
"T55UeygGctg","6267080","6272440"," yellow lines and the orange lines right the yellow one is the five-year seasonality the"
"T55UeygGctg","6272440","6279640"," 10 is the orange the 13 is the red one and the gray one is the all-time so on this table here"
"T55UeygGctg","6280200","6287880"," oh man for the past 24 years we should have a low form in october on all seasonalities"
"T55UeygGctg","6287960","6295240"," if we're in a bearish state or in the past five years we had a high develop in november"
"T55UeygGctg","6296040","6301560"," and another low in december and other than that there's always a high in december"
"T55UeygGctg","6304200","6310760"," now here we have all different markets that are saying the same thing it should be the same for"
"T55UeygGctg","6310840","6320360"," es ym rty um except for that russel should have a high form in december or in november again"
"T55UeygGctg","6321640","6326280"," now what has happened this year it's is it diverging from what had happened before"
"T55UeygGctg","6327160","6334200"," you know and the thing is is that like i i even though the seasonality doesn't follow it completely"
"T55UeygGctg","6334200","6340520"," for a specific time period for some reason these pivots when it says it will turn it will"
"T55UeygGctg","6340520","6346440"," temporarily turn in whichever direction it's saying it will go so like even on the 15th of"
"T55UeygGctg","6346440","6352680"," september in the discord i said you know we it's it's it's a weakness of window windows weakness"
"T55UeygGctg","6352680","6359640"," right now so we should go down at least until october which it did and we bounced right off this"
"T55UeygGctg","6359640","6366360"," area yeah it was the 12th or something about 15th of october yeah it was on the 4th of october"
"T55UeygGctg","6366360","6373320"," where we made that love and you know we've been going up non-stop and then okay yeah we"
"T55UeygGctg","6373320","6379000"," have two days going back and now one day up yesterday and now one day of a pullback again"
"T55UeygGctg","6379000","6384600"," but you know it could be that we are chopping consolidating who knows maybe we're accumulating"
"T55UeygGctg","6384600","6389720"," shorts to go back down you know i don't know and that's why i'm saying i'm just watching it day by day"
"T55UeygGctg","6390440","6395400"," however you know like i said i've been i've been looking at this now for about six months"
"T55UeygGctg","6396040","6403400"," so far i'm impressed by how i'm using it but am i trading off of it like putting on trades"
"T55UeygGctg","6403400","6409960"," for longer than a day no i'm not not yet do i want to yeah sure i do but i need some more"
"T55UeygGctg","6409960","6416360"," conviction and trust in that system and i don't know when that will be yet yeah i'm going to"
"T55UeygGctg","6416440","6422760"," at least share my uh let me share my screen really quick see if i can move this over here"
"T55UeygGctg","6432680","6439320"," and i don't know if i can share my screen here we're going to try"
"T55UeygGctg","6446360","6453080"," let me turn my screen off"
"T55UeygGctg","6455720","6460440"," so yeah just here on so on this seasonality chart and one thing i want to show you here is"
"T55UeygGctg","6461800","6465800"," uh in terms of seasonality you can you can just see here"
"T55UeygGctg","6469160","6473880"," you know you should keep running up there to rent like right here right and of course we you know"
"T55UeygGctg","6473880","6479720"," he just ripped faces off and then had that pullback still looks kind of the same direction here"
"T55UeygGctg","6480440","6489880"," um and then of course if you're looking right here this whole week here should mark some kind"
"T55UeygGctg","6489880","6496760"," of a high and then a pullback the next two weeks uh and then a pull up into end of end of year"
"T55UeygGctg","6497640","6505080"," uh but just like this yeah i see the same thing but still even with seasonality"
"T55UeygGctg","6506680","6515160"," like if you get those extremes on highs or even lows um you know it kind of is it kind of i"
"T55UeygGctg","6515160","6520440"," guess if we were to look at this on like a in a higher time frame it would all kind of blend"
"T55UeygGctg","6520440","6528360"," together but the idea here would be if we stay with seasonality that you get that last little"
"T55UeygGctg","6528360","6535720"," push up right there into friday and then we start that consolidation move down and then you get"
"T55UeygGctg","6535720","6542440"," that move up and possibly even up to test all that stuff up there but that doesn't put us really"
"T55UeygGctg","6542440","6547640"," where you want to be right i think that's where uh some of the banks have said that uh that 4500"
"T55UeygGctg","6548360","6552440"," would be the end of the year at max and i think Jamie diamond came out and said"
"T55UeygGctg","6554440","6561880"," he's expecting 3900 by end of year um let's go back to the main screen so they can see it"
"T55UeygGctg","6561880","6567720"," break down below the pivot uh now trading the hourly trigger and the daily trigger on spoons so this"
"T55UeygGctg","6567720","6574680"," full pullback happening later in the afternoon this is very not quite similar yesterday and uh"
"T55UeygGctg","6574760","6578840"," not only not not even not quite we didn't get the full bloodbath and the squeeze higher"
"T55UeygGctg","6579400","6587240"," just that straight pullback into uh that straight pullback into the hourly and daily trigger here"
"T55UeygGctg","6587240","6595320"," so the entire squeeze move uh from this morning at 9 30 10 30 the entire move erased big squeeze"
"T55UeygGctg","6595320","6601320"," higher straight back down into the hourly and daily candle here we'll find out what uh happens next"
"T55UeygGctg","6601560","6607800"," nice now i'm wondering about that with this whole gap down here that we left from this morning that"
"T55UeygGctg","6607800","6613160"," 4 a.m. gap down here we never close all right i'm showing it back here but it's"
"T55UeygGctg","6613880","6618360"," that 4 a.m. gap let me see if i can swing hold on a minute today i'm going to switch over here"
"T55UeygGctg","6619800","6623960"," so just right down here this is the gap that we were talking about this morning"
"T55UeygGctg","6624600","6630280"," see that gap down here they never closed this they closed this gap right here"
"T55UeygGctg","6631320","6637080"," but never closed this gap down here so question becomes do we go down there close that gap and then"
"T55UeygGctg","6637080","6645960"," you get your your next rip let me go back to the main screen here do they actually get down there"
"T55UeygGctg","6645960","6651400"," and just put that pain trade on that manipulation trade oh that one you meant okay yeah let's see"
"T55UeygGctg","6651400","6657960"," what you mean yeah it's it's hard let me see if i can show it on this one hold on here well"
"T55UeygGctg","6658040","6663160"," you know those that gap um they had it on my weebold chart this morning but"
"T55UeygGctg","6664200","6668920"," it's there's that there's a gap sneaky there's a sneaky little gap right down in here this is all"
"T55UeygGctg","6668920","6674920"," this all needs filled it's uh well the the thing is is where i or 31 81"
"T55UeygGctg","6675640","6683560"," go ahead what i what i suggest anyone to do on friday um mark the elastic and then on sunday"
"T55UeygGctg","6683560","6689800"," the first tick and that's no gap yeah yeah the friday sunday ticks tell them about that right"
"T55UeygGctg","6689800","6697240"," yeah yeah like they're called a new week opening gaps from what i've learned from ict but like"
"T55UeygGctg","6697240","6703640"," they dance around them all the time and like you keep the past five or six of them and that's"
"T55UeygGctg","6703640","6709560"," the only thing really the mark that's a different model that's a model in itself even you know um"
"T55UeygGctg","6709560","6715000"," because it the market just ping pongs between them all the time so once it gets rejected then"
"T55UeygGctg","6715000","6718280"," the other one it goes back to the other one you know and that's how it keeps jot"
"T55UeygGctg","6719320","6727000"," back and forth back and forth so you're you're marking something marking the the close on fridays"
"T55UeygGctg","6727000","6733640"," and the openings on sundays right yeah you're tracking those every week yeah and that's what i"
"T55UeygGctg","6733640","6742360"," was telling you the one that that runs from 43 51 25 to 43 56 50 i think not saying it's going"

"T55UeygGctg","6924920","6929640"," fuck man you know it's getting more expensive but the only reason why i was thinking that is"
"T55UeygGctg","6929640","6935320"," compared to what i had before that and it was because the rates were not low you know how much"
"T55UeygGctg","6935400","6937880"," what are rates right now in amsterdam on a new car"

"T55UeygGctg","7824840","7832520"," but not quite what it was like the 90s uh the 90s man it was really bad uh i think California"
"T55UeygGctg","7833960","7840200"," from my recollection they had great uh corridor travel but the in the city it was mixed bags"
"T55UeygGctg","7841560","7846120"," mixed bag on like the bark can be kind of weird to the the subway and San Francisco and get kind"
"T55UeygGctg","7846120","7849080"," of weird at what time of day that's the time you're on it"

"T55UeygGctg","7860200","7868920"," of it at the moment what um like infrastructure wise and compared to what it was like uh 10 years"
"T55UeygGctg","7869240","7877800"," ago well the country no Detroit no it's booming right now so Detroit like burned to the depths"
"T55UeygGctg","7877800","7884840"," of hell it was it was probably like the largest fall of grace without a recovery"
"T55UeygGctg","7886200","7894520"," in recent memory like so Boston New York like it's weird to speak to somebody today and they're"
"T55UeygGctg","7894520","7901320"," like uh LA is a shittle or San Francis shittle New York's a shittle Boston whatever you want to say"
"T55UeygGctg","7901320","7910440"," but people are i'm like how old are you were you alive in the 70s or the 90s because uh like"
"T55UeygGctg","7911000","7919560"," those cities were shittles in like the 1970s they started to turn around in the 1980s"

"T55UeygGctg","7925400","7932680"," around in 92 but when someone says there's a shittle now i'm like you have no idea how bad it"
"T55UeygGctg","7932680","7939720"," actually was back then like it doesn't hold a candle to how bad it was uh in those years"
"T55UeygGctg","7940600","7946520"," uh now Detroit did its own thing it like Detroit had declined in the 60s"
"T55UeygGctg","7947160","7954760"," from um from race riots and all kinds of like uh job like job is being taken away from African"
"T55UeygGctg","7954760","7960920"," Americans then you had like tacit segregation where there was segregation but everybody was"
"T55UeygGctg","7960920","7968440"," getting along because of jobs and all this shit and then uh our country had a um a large uh"
"T55UeygGctg","7968440","7975800"," societal upheaval right in the late 60s early 70s and uh basically uh Ford basically abandoned"
"T55UeygGctg","7975800","7980680"," Detroit and people left Detroit not just white people white people black people everybody"
"T55UeygGctg","7980680","7986440"," left Detroit and it's like it like burned to the ground i think the bottom if there was a bottom"
"T55UeygGctg","7986440","7992600"," for Detroit it was probably the year 2000 maybe 2000 right around right around the year 2000"
"T55UeygGctg","7993240","8001000"," and no other city that i can think of right now like on that scale and size uh has gone through"
"T55UeygGctg","8001000","8007720"," quite that not bounced back but Detroit is booming right now it is like booming"
"T55UeygGctg","8007720","8013640"," how cool uh and it's and i'll come back right now it's fucking awesome it's it's missing a few"
"T55UeygGctg","8013640","8021400"," keep it what it's probably missing is um it needs to capitalize on a second or third or fourth"
"T55UeygGctg","8022840","8030440"," like silicon valley alternative it needs to it was known for years as a mecca for tech so"
"T55UeygGctg","8031640","8035960"," for for the auto industry so they have been attracting some of the auto industry"

"T55UeygGctg","8532920","8538520"," down here you didn't catch that bellow to the downside so bellow is telling you got more down"

"T55UeygGctg","8814920","8816040"," let's extend that up"
"T55UeygGctg","8819080","8820840"," that's that grind higher right"
"T55UeygGctg","8824600","8830360"," that's that expectation that we trade up into friday and tag that 440"
"T55UeygGctg","8831800","8838760"," we also have that 451 here that 445 and that 451 so we've got"
"T55UeygGctg","8840360","8846600"," this one up here this big gap needs filled and then this 445 up here too so not just that 440"
"T55UeygGctg","8847560","8853400"," my thesis here is that they won't park this uh exactly at 440 on friday"
"T55UeygGctg","8853400","8859000"," they might um but it always seems to me like they'll squeeze up take that stuff out then come"
"T55UeygGctg","8859000","8865720"," back down and park it into that 440 for that friday so that's what i'm kind of gunning for here is"
"T55UeygGctg","8865720","8871240"," that they go even higher we still have it's like today's tuesday we got wednesday thursday and friday"
"T55UeygGctg","8871240","8878440"," that could send us up there and i want to see that 451 trade up into friday right now we're tracking"
"T55UeygGctg","8878440","8883240"," that 440 into the close of friday for end of month"
"T55UeygGctg","8884840","8888280"," and then we tagged it here yesterday they sold it we tagged it here they sold it"
"T55UeygGctg","8889080","8894440"," and we're finding buyers down below and hopefully these buyers are still here to the downside"
"T55UeygGctg","8894440","8899720"," we're still above the daily and the in the hourly triggers so the bulls are in control here"
"T55UeygGctg","8900520","8907880"," to send this higher so just into tomorrow and uh let's say it's tuesday mitt wednesday"
"T55UeygGctg","8907880","8915880"," and then thursday volatility in here whoop pull on here that was the that was the post market"
"T55UeygGctg","8916520","8925720"," sellers down there so just into into uh excuse me wednesday thursday and friday uh upside target"
"T55UeygGctg","8925720","8933240"," for tomorrow i'm on the bull's side here so as long as price stays above the hourly trigger"
"T55UeygGctg","8934120","8936760"," uh i still have that target right there"
"T55UeygGctg","8939160","8940760"," so this is still your target"
"T55UeygGctg","8945160","8946520"," let me make this large here"
"T55UeygGctg","8952040","8953640"," if you want to screenshot this"
"T55UeygGctg","8954360","8965000"," now there is something to be said here now that i want to keep you in tune with which is"
"T55UeygGctg","8965720","8972280"," uh the half hour velocity is not on bull's side or see the half hour velocity is on the bull's side"
"T55UeygGctg","8973320","8979080"," uh and price is on the bull's side so price on bull's side half hour velocity on bull's side"
"T55UeygGctg","8979160","8985240"," the daily velocity is on bull's side uh daily velo doesn't actually need to come down it can stay"
"T55UeygGctg","8986200","8991160"," elevated for that smooth higher there's no requirement that it goes to minus 25 minus 50"
"T55UeygGctg","8991160","8996360"," especially if we're having a rounding and daily velocity and you can see that rounding in the daily"
"T55UeygGctg","8996360","9005080"," right there so uh the expectation is here we grind up minimum into 440 into friday now there"
"T55UeygGctg","9005080","9011240"," is a possibility we could at some point still see that weakness and watch that gap get filled"
"T55UeygGctg","9011240","9016920"," in the weekly here uh so just be really careful of that gap down there if you're really looking for"
"T55UeygGctg","9017560","9024120"," you're really looking for like the extreme hey this is my chance to catch low it is down below"
"T55UeygGctg","9024120","9028200"," you can see it right here there's a gap right here and there's a small gap over here that hasn't"
"T55UeygGctg","9028280","9035240"," been filled yet uh tiny little gap back here on uh 433 34 or so somewhere in here"
"T55UeygGctg","9035800","9041720"," there's a there's a teeny teeny teeny teeny tiny gap but this gap right here has not been filled"
"T55UeygGctg","9041720","9045720"," so if you're like hey cap i want i want to be more conservative in my dip buy and that kind of"
"T55UeygGctg","9045720","9051800"," stuff it's probably down there uh if not uh we are prices above the daily and the weekly the"
"T55UeygGctg","9051800","9056360"," expectation is that we push higher let's see i got some zero date calls here i'm probably"
"T55UeygGctg","9056360","9059720"," going to get some uh weekly's right now as well i'm going to add to my position"
"T55UeygGctg","9060360","9066360"," uh so i've got four thirty eights for today now they're worthless they're like pennies"
"T55UeygGctg","9066360","9072920"," and i'm going to add some uh in the money calls for friday"
"T55UeygGctg","9078120","9083720"," yeah maybe not in the money the 440's are a dollar or three"
"T55UeygGctg","9086600","9090600"," so"
"T55UeygGctg","9112920","9115480"," now among uh 438 for today"
"T55UeygGctg","9115480","9120480"," And I've got 440 C's for Friday, for October 20th."
"T55UeygGctg","9124160","9126120"," I mean, you can take a snapshot of that at home"
"T55UeygGctg","9126120","9129320"," and you can see the expectation here."
"T55UeygGctg","9129320","9132520"," If we have a break of, hold on."
"T55UeygGctg","9134160","9138720"," If we have a breakdown of price on the daily trigger,"
"T55UeygGctg","9139920","9141560"," this is more exaggeration."
"T55UeygGctg","9146480","9149480"," Well, this is where you buy the dip."
"T55UeygGctg","9149480","9151480"," You do buy the dip here."
"T55UeygGctg","9151480","9153480"," This is the place to buy the dip to go up"
"T55UeygGctg","9153480","9155480"," into 444 in Friday."
"T55UeygGctg","9155480","9158480"," If we do begin to lose the hourly and daily, though,"
"T55UeygGctg","9158480","9161480"," right here, you do want to take this straight"
"T55UeygGctg","9161480","9164480"," to the downside to close that downside gap."
"T55UeygGctg","9166480","9170480"," So you can snap that from at home and keep this on you."
"T55UeygGctg","9171480","9176480"," You want to see some kind of like vicious downside move."
"T55UeygGctg","9179480","9181480"," Maybe that helps you out."
"T55UeygGctg","9187480","9189480"," All right, I'm going to get rid of this stuff now."
"T55UeygGctg","9189480","9192480"," Take a snip at home so you have that."
"T55UeygGctg","9193480","9196480"," I am bullish here into that 444."
"T55UeygGctg","9196480","9197480"," However long that takes."
"T55UeygGctg","9197480","9200480"," If it's tomorrow, today, if it's up here,"
"T55UeygGctg","9200480","9203480"," even, and I still think you have available the 445"
"T55UeygGctg","9203480","9205480"," and the 451."
