"69520","71080"," Check one two check. "
"99230","100530"," Good morning."
"101130","102530"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"108400","109920"," Get right into it here."
"110860","111840"," Have a lot of time. "
"115340","117480"," Get some stuff to do here this morning."
"117480","118860"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"142480","143480"," Just a second here."
"154000","155440"," Think tight, just one second. "
"158110","158910"," Good morning."
"161050","161810"," How are you?"
"162950","164150"," I'm on a stream."
"164870","165090"," Hold on. "
"224150","225630"," All right, good morning."
"232090","233570"," You're all doing well this morning."
"233570","235090"," I'm assuming out there. "
"238990","242490"," I'm assuming you're all doing all right out there this morning."
"243170","244330"," See we got up here."
"244430","245470"," We got that one right there. "
"247030","248630"," Another one right there."
"250790","253050"," We got a pre-market high already."
"255250","256190"," That one yellow. "
"258810","261690"," You know, not financial advice, of course."
"263890","265350"," You guys know what I do."
"265530","266390"," I'm assuming at this point. "
"267350","268930"," There's a gap down below here."
"269370","270670"," If you can see there's a gap down here."
"272030","276970"," You can see that down there. "
"277050","277450"," There's a gap."
"277630","278630"," There's a bunch of stuff down here."
"279410","280510"," I got to go back through. "
"284510","290610"," I'm assuming here that a lot of people are happy this morning."
"293050","294150"," Can we get more upside?"
"294370","295690"," I'm assuming people are going to ask that."
"297870","299490"," They're more upside potential. "
"301010","305090"," We've got scenes of the, we got a gap above up here above our three, believe it or not."
"305750","308890"," I was going to give you guys some levels for NVDA this morning."
"309090","311950"," We'll go over that this morning if you're on NVDA. "
"313890","316430"," We'll go over if you want a short NVDA or not."
"317890","319330"," Nvidia, Nvidia."
"320890","322110"," This is what I like to call it. "
"323250","326710"," But S1, S2, S3 down there."
"326870","328690"," A bunch of gaps still left down below here."
"329710","331190"," The gap is right here. "
"332370","336950"," I'm sure people are going to try to come in and, and sure SPY."
"337610","339690"," We have five minutes left until the open."
"340730","341850"," Good morning out there. "
"342330","343550"," I hope you're all doing well."
"343770","345430"," Hope you all had a great night."
"349720","350620"," Good morning. "
"351580","353200"," Good morning to you all."
"353360","353860"," Good morning."
"354260","354640"," Good morning. "
"354640","355080"," Good morning."
"355140","355500"," Good morning."
"355640","355960"," Good morning. "
"357280","358040"," It's a Dorfa."
"358380","359540"," Good morning, Deckhand, Dougie."
"359640","360320"," Good to see you, brother. "
"360680","361840"," Good morning, G-Dad, Gold."
"363480","366720"," Check it in this morning and you're not a member on YouTube."
"366720","369860"," If you're watching on YouTube and want to be able to chat, there's two ways to chat. "
"370860","372860"," You can chat with a membership."
"373180","374200"," It's $5 per month."
"374540","376120"," It's cheaper than a bear, actually. "
"376780","378240"," If you're like, I'm never doing a tip, anybody."
"378680","380500"," I'm never going to support anybody doing work."
"381140","386240"," You can always go to Twitch and sign up to chat there via Amazon Prime. "
"387380","388720"," And it's a free option."
"389040","391340"," So there is a free option for you to chat in this stream."
"392320","393120"," If you like. "
"395940","400680"," Off this opening bell right here, nothing has changed the same every day, okay?"
"401080","402160"," This white line right here."
"403020","405600"," We'll see if we find support off of this white line."
"405780","408100"," There's going to be a lot of horse trading off of this open. "
"409220","412060"," You're going to see on this open."
"412680","413640"," You're going to see people."
"413640","415360"," You're going to see, I call them dipshits. "
"415680","416200"," They're going to come in."
"417220","420800"," The dealers are going to fuck around for the first."
"421120","422120"," It could be 40 minutes. "
"422600","424080"," It could be 5 minutes, 15 minutes."
"424980","425600"," 40 minutes."
"425620","432100"," They're going to take everybody's bets because they're going to get people rage rage this morning. "
"432660","433680"," You know, in this stream, right?"
"433880","437300"," I got nothing against bears or bulls or anybody, but I got to tell you."
"438100","442420"," If there was one ticker."
"444480","446100"," That a bear wants to short. "
"446880","450980"," This past three months in my chat when we have the chat open."
"451640","454200"," It's the high pens down."
"455620","458340"," The only ticker everybody talks about shorting. "
"458460","467100"," It's the only one."
"467100","472360"," Is it so for all the happiness that I have is when I make a ton of money this morning,"
"472360","473720"," but for all even for all that happiness."
"474780","481780"," I'm sure last night that I'm positive last night that some people's accounts were just shut down. "
"481960","486520"," They're going to get letters and all that kind of stuff and send me everything you own and all that"
"486520","486900"," kind of shit."
"486900","490200"," But they weren't even a choice."
"490620","495840"," I saw some people on Ben Twitch saying they had shorted NVDA and they were able to get out of"
"495840","496020"," it. "
"496080","497160"," Or I was like, no, you didn't."
"497520","498700"," That's not how that happens."
"500100","503740"," When you get when shit like that happens and you're short. "
"504740","505680"," Shut your ass down."
"506600","507740"," It's not how it happens."
"508120","511500"," So let's see what this open is right here. "
"511620","512620"," There's a couple minutes left."
"514200","515360"," And until the open."
"519400","521720"," And we'll wait and see what they're what they say we're going to make. "
"521900","523300"," You know what my take on this stuff is."
"523420","523600"," Okay."
"523940","525360"," You know how I feel about this stuff. "
"526900","530880"," So when I'm trading, especially one dates, zero dates, two dates."
"532140","533860"," It's always a directional trade for me."
"534240","536020"," I renegotiate the trade that kind of stuff. "
"537640","540120"," If I'm losing, I'll sometimes leave them on."
"541580","544120"," But if I'm winning, I take that money."
"544580","547000"," So let's say I let's say I make a trade for eight cents. "
"547160","547720"," It goes up $3."
"549300","550520"," I take that money and run."
"550740","553340"," If you think we're going to continue to go up or I think I'm going to continue to go up,"
"553480","554980"," I'll rebuy at eight cents. "
"557980","562820"," You know, if that trade loses and it's then worth four cents, I'm still a winner."
"563940","565320"," Does that money came from a winning trade?"
"565580","566000"," Does that make sense?"
"568580","573900"," When you're in those like using when you're using like weekly or weekly is one day, three day calls"
"573900","575060"," puts doesn't matter."
"575360","576980"," It's like a directional bias. "
"577200","578900"," We're going from point A to point B."
"579380","584580"," It's not point A to point B down to point A again and a half and then up to like"
"584580","584860"," D."
"585800","588140"," You'll get torched if you do that."
"594720","598980"," If you're if you're long and VDA, I got to let you know something else."
"599140","602980"," If you're long in VDA, I've been in that trade twice before. "
"604700","606360"," Exact, exact outcome."
"607760","613480"," If you are up significantly, if you're in the stream and you're up significantly right now on this"
"613480","615340"," open, I'm going to tell you something next 20 seconds."
"615340","621540"," You may not get fills at the ask or the bid or do not do market like go down in"
"621540","623820"," your in your limit order until it hits. "
"624180","628100"," It could be a jagged fill and you may not get a fill."
"628320","631200"," So let's say you're up 10,000%."
"631200","634480"," You might have to take 9,500%. "
"660560","661240"," I'm out."
"663380","663860"," Okay."
"668710","670470"," Thank you very fucking much. "
"675650","682920"," So if you're still trying to exit in an N VDA position, it's difficult."
"683420","684560"," It'll be like a jagged fill."
"685880","687040"," I'm fucking out. "
"687420","689620"," Oh man, that felt so fucking good there."
"714320","715100"," I'm so stoked."
"715100","716640"," Go on, take the money and run. "
"717400","721800"," Go on, take the money and run."
"723620","727520"," Yeah, go on, take the money and run."
"730040","737660"," Now, if you want to renegotiate this trade, there's step three. "
"737660","747060"," I just walked you through yesterday's clothes and just walked you through how to secure profit"
"747060","750860"," before it happens."
"751720","753140"," And now look what happened."
"755340","760820"," So it's time for you to renegotiate your thesis. "
"766880","768760"," It's fucking bear time, baby."
"768940","770240"," I shit you not, Lane."
"770720","775380"," I was like, I was like, do we even fucking trade today?"
"775680","778000"," Is there any need to trade today?"
"780260","782280"," I don't think there is. "
"784620","794410"," I don't think I don't think there is."
"795310","796410"," I think Lane is right."
"798450","800150"," I don't need a trade at the moment. "
"808850","810690"," Hope you're all doing well."
"810890","814050"," Hope you all got your money, took your profit on that fucking bow."
"815030","818310"," If you didn't, take it as a life lesson. "
"827880","830680"," Always a life lesson, secure profit."
"833840","837200"," Golden rule, renegotiate."
"839120","842520"," Sometimes with hindsight trading, I'll be like, I could have done this. "
"845640","847200"," Oh, I would have made more money."
"850200","851980"," I love securing profit."
"852820","853420"," Love it. "
"853820","854060"," Love it."
"854340","854580"," Love it."
"855000","855180"," Love it. "
"865420","867580"," Give a lot to talk about today one way or another."
"867700","872220"," I think we are going to drink beer early today, but we have a lot to talk about today."
"872540","880900"," We have to discuss a few things this morning at some point. "
"881000","882360"," We got a lot to discuss here."
"891790","893370"," That's like right off the bell, man."
"893810","897170"," That's like, that's like slam puts. "
"897770","903730"," And you have the crazy part about the slam puts right on the bell is they're still upside down in"
"903730","904590"," those puts right now."
"906610","908950"," Like a dealer steps in and he goes, you want some puts?"
"909230","909930"," They're five dollars."
"911930","914810"," And then we blast down and someone's like, whoo. "
"916330","920590"," So they're up for like 30 seconds and then boom, they drop the price of those puts."
"923050","925070"," So now they're committed for more down."
"927190","929230"," Like we better keep going down. "
"929510","930450"," That's that's what happens."
"932170","933870"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"933990","934810"," Hope you're all doing well. "
"935050","936870"," Hope you're all took the profit off the bell."
"937650","942350"," You know what my stance on this is I've said it a thousand times."
"947060","957010"," Catch it a quick bounce here"
"957010","960490"," on N V D in their channel. "
"960770","965010"," If you guys trade zigzag channels."
"965810","968910"," They just bounced on their channel, but I don't know if it'll hold or not."
"971310","972070"," Good morning. "
"972070","972190"," Good morning."
"974850","975250"," Yeah."
"979630","981690"," So there some people got blown up yesterday. "
"982190","984470"," I didn't want to say this on Finto yesterday."
"986590","987950"," Because those two things."
"988190","990530"," This is a small conversation we have to have here in the stream. "
"992790","998690"," So yesterday when when an video went when I know it's in however, it's N V D when it went"
"998690","999690"," up yesterday, right?"
"1000810","1003090"," I was like, I'm not going to say anything about this aspect to it."
"1005010","1007830"," When when you get blown up in that kind of a trade badly."
"1009930","1011750"," Your your trading life is over. "
"1014090","1015810"," For a period of time, right?"
"1018450","1023829"," So we're probably going to lose more people in Finto it over that yesterday."
"1024849","1026329"," I don't like seeing that."
"1027750","1028510"," I'll be honest. "
"1028810","1029550"," I don't like seeing that."
"1029550","1032030"," And that leads me to the question in this stream."
"1032329","1032410"," Okay. "
"1033430","1036130"," It's like, I'm happy here, but I just in this stream."
"1038390","1042650"," If you're winning, it's fine to be like, woohoo, I'm winning."
"1046109","1052750"," Try to not try to not rip on other people that are in losing positions. "
"1054130","1055550"," I don't know if I'm wording that rightly."
"1057590","1064530"," If someone's getting their ass handed to them, try to have at least some empathy for them."
"1064790","1068310"," Or joke around in a loving way. "
"1070090","1072670"," Like, I know they're like on Wall Street bets and shit."
"1072930","1074410"," We should have people there and stuff like that."
"1074910","1076350"," It's a kind of like an appropriate place for it. "
"1076930","1078790"," Like here in this stream, it's a small community here."
"1078790","1088670"," So just attempt to throw a shoulder, maybe an arm around the shoulder of somebody or try to"
"1088670","1089190"," support them."
"1089430","1091290"," Maybe joke later about it with them, that kind of stuff. "
"1092470","1093830"," I don't care if it's a bearable."
"1097590","1099970"," You can like, you can rejoice like, hey, I made a bunch of money."
"1100170","1101450"," Yeah, it was awesome. "
"1103530","1104730"," Get these gaps down below."
"1104890","1105810"," They're trying to close down here."
"1106690","1107630"," We got our one down here. "
"1109250","1111150"," I'm like, dude, I ain't giving none of my money back."
"1112790","1113970"," Go fuck themselves."
"1117490","1118450"," You're gonna buy some calls?"
"1118690","1119670"," I'm like, nah, not at the moment. "
"1127300","1129480"," No, I don't want to give any calls back."
"1130100","1131640"," Get gaps down here that need to be filled."
"1133860","1135360"," Got these two gaps right here. "
"1135520","1138860"," Got a gap at 412.55. Got another gap again filled right now."
"1144830","1146530"," Coming into the daily trigger next."
"1147010","1147810"," It's right down here. "
"1151640","1153400"," You have another pre-market right down here."
"1157070","1164030"," Just try to be, just try to, you know, you can be like, fuck yeah, I'm winning or you can"
"1164030","1166170"," like say, you have generalizations, of course."
"1166490","1169850"," Like yeah, fuck the bears and fuck the bulls and all that kind of shit as long as it's from"
"1169850","1172070"," the perspective of you guys. "
"1172210","1173990"," I know that you guys know the difference between."
"1176230","1178750"," Like ribbon, you're, let's say I'm a bull, right?"
"1178850","1179090"," I'm a bull."
"1179810","1182050"," I'm ribbon like a bear next to me or something like that. "
"1182250","1182790"," That's one thing."
"1183330","1188570"," If it's in good, none of it's taste or it's coming from a place of being a friend."
"1188870","1190450"," But if you're just like, go fuck yourself. "
"1190750","1191130"," I hate you."
"1191470","1196810"," Try to save it, man, because like, you know, we're all traders, man."
"1196870","1198150"," We're all trying to trade together, you know. "
"1198910","1205230"," We're retailers, we're eating each other is kind of the wrong thing, right?"
"1205350","1207510"," We're supposed to be eating the rich at some point, right?"
"1207710","1210950"," We're trying to take money out of these very wealthy people's pockets."
"1211750","1213830"," One way or another, bearish bullish."
"1213870","1214750"," I don't care how you do it. "
"1215870","1223430"," It's bad enough that these fucking very wealthy people do everything that they possibly can to take"
"1223430","1224130"," money away from you."
"1226570","1228350"," Press half a deal with each other, right?"
"1228530","1229190"," Trying to kill each other."
"1229390","1232510"," A little bit more gap down below. "
"1232630","1239470"," We got some gapage at 4.12.37. And we're going to take a look right now at a couple"
"1239470","1239690"," of things."
"1239910","1241630"," So right down in here, you should find some buyers."
"1242830","1246970"," Maybe we tagged this 4.12. There's something for us to know here. "
"1250290","1253210"," Let's make them mute this."
"1257370","1263230"," I want you to always stay with your, I want you to always stay with your rules, okay?"
"1263930","1272170"," You can break your rules, but it is important for you to stick with your rules."
"1272910","1274030"," Know when to break them. "
"1278020","1280160"," You can know when to break your rules."
"1281060","1287180"," Like I get that break in your rules, but when your rules work and you have high probability setups,"
"1287180","1288460"," they're amazing."
"1289160","1291940"," So what do we know here?"
"1293240","1296560"," We're at 30 minute chart right now, right?"
"1297060","1298760"," We're coming into the, well, a couple of things. "
"1299540","1309230"," We knew this was going up and we knew that if we got this confirmation"
"1309230","1310890"," bounce that we were going higher."
"1313690","1317830"," The amount of time we actually spent is a 30 minute chart, but in a five minute chart, we spent"
"1317830","1318710"," so much time here."
"1320110","1322710"," Right, and we bent the hourly sideways. "
"1323690","1331930"," Right, we stopped the vertical negative bearish hourly was violent to the downside, started to turn"
"1331930","1336730"," sideways, and then helped a bull out get that rip up, right?"
"1339070","1340850"," So just on this 30 minute chart."
"1341990","1343010"," Let's switch to a one minute."
"1350090","1354090"," Just on a 30 minute chart or a one minute chart, excuse me, this is the spot specifically. "
"1356330","1358270"," We need something to happen here, right?"
"1358730","1363310"," So right now we've got a bear, see right here, you've got a bear airplane."
"1364770","1370550"," And you have an hourly trigger, which is bearish."
"1373090","1378870"," And can lead to as long as price stays down, can actually lead to us heading lower. "
"1379810","1381870"," You actually bounce here too, head higher."
"1382970","1386270"," There's no trade force here is my point, but not for a bull."
"1388370","1392090"," So if you're like, hey, I want to take along here, you need to see something happen. "
"1393890","1401330"," You need to see the five minute come underneath."
"1403830","1405010"," One minute come up."
"1410950","1413490"," And here's this, here's this hourly down here, right?"
"1413630","1414210"," That comes over. "
"1414450","1416110"," You need price to come back above."
"1419450","1427630"," And believe it or not, one maybe even possibly two bounces and then show you the way higher."
"1430510","1433430"," And that becomes a high probability trade. "
"1437370","1441310"," This is like your professional day trader, maybe."
"1442990","1446790"," Right, I know I got a bounce, I know I'm catching a bounce here and I can trade this up,"
"1446990","1451910"," but like probably 70% of you can't take this trade."
"1453650","1456950"," 70% of you have to wait for the confirmation to the upside. "
"1457290","1460150"," You can set the trade up, be ready to take trade."
"1460940","1469070"," You want to be a trader that's winning nine trades, eight trades, seven trades, bangers, high"
"1469070","1469330"," conviction."
"1471270","1473730"," They don't fail on you frequently. "
"1477730","1481850"," So if you can wait for this and have the patience for this, this is the way."
"1486000","1491200"," If you are a bear and you are looking for the downside move, right?"
"1492000","1499340"," Outside of this initial move right here, down right, you are waiting for all this shit to come"
"1499340","1499640"," down."
"1500320","1507360"," Believe it or not, believe it or not, price to get underneath for 12 and reject twice and then to"
"1507360","1507660"," the downside. "
"1507780","1508660"," So you set this up."
"1508780","1512400"," So your initial opening move to the downside and my view is over."
"1514960","1521800"," Next trade to the downside is a break below 412 with the one five minutes narrowly coming back for"
"1521800","1521960"," you. "
"1523760","1527020"," The downside trade right now is over if you're a bear, in my view."
"1529480","1530860"," Can we consolidate in here?"
"1531200","1532960"," Apps to fucking Lulie and then make a way down."
"1533320","1535260"," Apps to fucking Lulie, but the downside trade is over. "
"1535520","1536960"," You're looking for some rejection above here."
"1537640","1540580"," 14 30 or 14 for 13 80."
"1542080","1543700"," You're looking for a downside move there. "
"1543860","1544700"," I don't think you're going to get it."
"1545000","1545320"," You're honest."
"1550420","1552460"," So we'll see how this plays out here. "
"1552600","1553820"," We'll see if this consult."
"1554120","1556580"," We'll see if this consolidates and bounces around."
"1561160","1562820"," In here, I don't think that it does. "
"1563880","1567960"," I do think that we bounce above and we begin to make our way higher."
"1568080","1568900"," That's what I think happens."
"1568900","1573660"," We still have a bunch of puts and I'm not taking a trade unless this happens here either. "
"1573840","1575260"," So I'm not taking any trades in here."
"1575280","1576360"," I'm just waiting to see what happens."
"1576700","1581580"," I'm not going to get caught up and it bouncing around kind of bullshit in here and get destroyed"
"1581580","1582700"," and all that kind of stuff. "
"1583260","1584680"," I want nothing to do with it."
"1585200","1586340"," I have a perfect step to go up."
"1587860","1595020"," I need my breakdown below to buy a put here, but this shit in here. "
"1597480","1599380"," That's that that's where you get chewed up."
"1603900","1605560"," So there's no trade for me right now."
"1605700","1606620"," There's no trade to the downside. "
"1608060","1610300"," There's no trade to the upside for me personally."
"1611540","1614140"," Now some of you are all going to be like I'm buying the one minute here."
"1614300","1615060"," I'm selling out of it. "
"1615300","1617020"," I'm going to buy that again in here."
"1617940","1618460"," That's all fine."
"1620160","1620720"," For me. "
"1621660","1624360"," This is all horse trading in here right now."
"1624980","1626440"," People are going to get fucked up."
"1627160","1628160"," I assure you. "
"1637770","1641770"," You've got on the one minute chart a bear plane right here."
"1642630","1643570"," So you can see it."
"1643650","1644210"," You're aware of it. "
"1648020","1651420"," Five minute chart, bear plane forming."
"1652460","1653700"," It could take some time."
"1657300","1658760"," Let's see the bear plane right here. "
"1661960","1662700"," Right there."
"1668530","1670350"," There's also a bear trap in there too."
"1670350","1671010"," Believe it or not. "
"1671690","1672750"," I want nothing to do."
"1672890","1674350"," I want nothing to do with this zone here."
"1675790","1677310"," Personally, I want nothing to do with that zone. "
"1695060","1695720"," Good morning."
"1700840","1702040"," Hope you're all doing well."
"1711770","1713130"," See if that helps out there. "
"1719140","1720600"," There are three above."
"1733780","1734580"," How are y'all doing?"
"1738280","1740340"," Yeah, I had to hammer the sell button a bunch."
"1740820","1744700"," There's like this weird like whenever you're in these trades that if you're if you're trading in"
"1744700","1745100"," VDA. "
"1745920","1747920"," Twice have been in that a similar trade."
"1748200","1750760"," I know three times three times have been in a similar trade."
"1751100","1751880"," It's a twice. "
"1753180","1754260"," I was in a."
"1754800","1758120"," I was in the TikTok Google trade."
"1758780","1760360"," I was like in it that morning."
"1760740","1761320"," The moment it was. "
"1763800","1765340"," Announced of a possible deal."
"1765780","1769740"," The first time I got in like the moment that it broke."
"1770520","1772240"," The second time was a."
"1773600","1775540"," An apple split and then a tassel. "
"1775620","1778300"," I think I've done a couple of those apple tassel split kind of stuff."
"1780960","1785060"," And just trying to close those trades out dealers are like go fuck yourself, bro."
"1785160","1785960"," We're not doing that. "
"1786120","1787420"," It has more to do with."
"1788540","1789780"," It has more to do with."
"1792960","1797780"," I'm assuming that the desk is like well, can we can we sell these to somebody else?"
"1797920","1799420"," We're not going to hold this and take a hit. "
"1800700","1802300"," For mid six figures on you."
"1802640","1803160"," Go fuck yourself."
"1803580","1804640"," Something like that, you know. "
"1812410","1814970"," If you want me to answer your question, yes, I did piss it all away."
"1817610","1819450"," Every last dollar every day pissed away."
"1820410","1821230"," I fucking party. "
"1821350","1821870"," It was awesome."
"1844990","1845710"," Consolidation, baby."
"1847690","1849550"," There's a chance of a good downside move here too. "
"1851630","1853510"," I like the idea of some more downside."
"1856450","1860350"," And we have to talk about something else to talk about this morning."
"1860750","1862570"," I'm going to see if I can bring it up for you in just a moment. "
"1865370","1866850"," And we're going to talk about."
"1870070","1871570"," I've harped on this a bunch."
"1876970","1883200"," But I was talking to Winky this morning and I was like, you know what?"
"1883780","1890920"," I was like, I think I think I'm going to think people are going to point fingers at me. "
"1893820","1896180"," Well, let me start with the different conversation."
"1896400","1896840"," So."
"1896840","1905940"," I was talking about the flow of the show. "
"1908160","1911060"," So I was trying to explain to somebody to flow of our show."
"1911200","1911420"," It's like."
"1913640","1915820"," It's like if we're going up, right?"
"1917300","1920060"," If we're going up, the show will be filled with bulls. "
"1923910","1926150"," So let's say we start right here."
"1929030","1930430"," And we end right here, right?"
"1931990","1933910"," Start going up, bulls show up to the show."
"1935570","1937470"," I say, we're long. "
"1938710","1939630"," Some go long."
"1942410","1945570"," And I say, we're getting out of the, we were getting out of the position now."
"1946930","1947190"," Right?"
"1947530","1948410"," And I was like right here. "
"1951900","1957440"," A lot of people in the show are coming or coming to the show are saying, Hey, Cap, can I"
"1957440","1958280"," buy calls here?"
"1959440","1959920"," Right?"
"1961660","1962720"," Show us full of bulls."
"1965440","1968360"," As we're exiting, we're like, Oh, no, we're getting out of this trade."
"1970580","1972120"," For a pullback, right?"
"1975280","1977340"," Now the next week or whatever. "
"1978260","1980520"," As we pull back, the bulls disappear."
"1982500","1984060"," And then bears come into the show."
"1988640","1990680"," And they're like, you super bull. "
"1993420","1997720"," We're rolling over a crash and you suck and I'm like, okay."
"1998900","1999800"," So we sell."
"2001700","2002820"," We're full of bears. "
"2004260","2007620"," And then as we make a turn, we repeat the cycle."
"2009540","2010020"," Right?"
"2010200","2010920"," We're going to buy this dip."
"2010920","2011760"," We're going to exit our puts. "
"2011760","2016900"," From JP Morgan, who said that two peg plus is making good on its promise to cut supplies."
"2017500","2020400"," And you get some bears down here that are just getting started getting short."
"2020680","2020980"," Makes sense. "
"2022180","2026120"," So we repeat this cycle over and over and over in stream."
"2027700","2029620"," So this is just a note for you."
"2029820","2032540"," If you are a bear or a bull out there. "
"2033740","2036620"," And you only come to the stream while it's good or while it's bad."
"2038200","2041820"," Or you only have an hour out of your day to come into the stream."
"2041820","2048480"," If I can't work in all day or taking care of kids or when I'm in a position, I come"
"2048480","2048880"," to the show. "
"2050179","2053000"," We talk about a lot during the course of a day is my point."
"2054100","2057219"," We talk about a lot of different concepts through the course of a day."
"2057500","2060340"," And over the course of a week, we talk about a lot of different concepts. "
"2062219","2066679"," So you may only be getting a portion of the show or even."
"2066980","2068100"," I don't know how to combat that."
"2068139","2071380"," I don't know if it's something where if we talk about a subject. "
"2072699","2076940"," Maybe I type it out somewhere and it's like in the part of the screen of the show so that"
"2076940","2080900"," you guys can keep track of what we're discussing in the show."
"2081280","2083719"," Or if you come here late, you can or another like an hour."
"2084420","2087760"," You can read something really quick and say, oh, they've discussed these topics. "
"2092239","2098320"," And this leads into what I want to talk to you about is I don't want if if there's any"
"2098320","2100460"," fallout from this debt cycle deal."
"2101520","2106780"," I don't want to be like a finger pointed saying, well, I didn't talk about that."
"2108200","2112360"," Because people that are in the show all day long, they're all aware of what we discuss. "
"2114600","2115660"," But not everybody."
"2115860","2117600"," Some people are like, I can only come two hours a day cap."
"2118220","2120920"," And so they might miss some of our conversations that we have. "
"2121560","2124760"," So I need to do a portion of the show today."
"2126940","2130340"," On at least making sure that everybody is aware."
"2133240","2138280"," Of debt ceiling risk that ceiling deal risk that kind of stuff. "
"2143460","2146040"," And ensure that all of you at least have an idea of."
"2147600","2148900"," How to hedge that risk."
"2149480","2152740"," As I was speaking, McCarthy did say that he spoke to McConnell yesterday. "
"2153380","2157380"," It does bring us now to five minutes away to the top of the hour where we are expecting the"
"2157380","2160080"," release of the US pending home sales change month over month."
"2160720","2166100"," For cost is one percent on the prior minus five spot to two percent and the pending homes index saw"
"2166100","2168200"," a prior read of 78 spot nine."
"2168820","2172480"," So again, to keep in mind, the US House Speaker McCarthy speaking to reporters once again. "
"2174600","2177720"," In part of hedging that risk is sometimes just doing nothing."
"2178620","2180720"," Can be removing yourself in the market."
"2181520","2187080"," Can be just not selling if you're if you own stock, just not selling and sitting on your hands. "
"2188520","2190040"," It can be a hedge."
"2193340","2198400"," I don't like the idea either even saying like how do you hedge that event risk."
"2199160","2201420"," I don't even like the idea of just saying fucking I'm short. "
"2201620","2203240"," Like I think that's even sketchy as fuck."
"2204060","2205780"," I just want to make sure everybody's aware of it."
"2205900","2209380"," I don't want anyone to come back and say hey, you never discussed this because I have discussed it"
"2209380","2209580"," here. "
"2210700","2216860"," Ad nauseam and there's some risk there even if there's no reason for that risk to exist."
"2217700","2222640"," If only because of the positioning of people."
"2224360","2228080"," You can position a certain way and sometimes see. "
"2230280","2233100"," Let's say everything is peachy and we still drop."
"2233920","2237980"," It could be due just just to the due to the fact that hey, we're in this position."
"2237980","2239600"," We're going to make a print one way or another. "
"2242520","2244460"," You oftentimes see that as well, right?"
"2245220","2246820"," I own two billion dollars in spy."
"2247720","2250260"," I'm short spy and it's not going my way."
"2251160","2254500"," So the two hundred or two billion that I own, I just start dumping it. "
"2255500","2258880"," Prints my shorts and rebuy the spy again."
"2259360","2261880"," I have that ability to do that, right?"
"2262200","2265920"," I have enough money into the market that I can actually make those moves, right?"
"2266040","2268160"," Especially in a low volume environment."
"2269660","2275620"," Like real money selling when we're in a low volume environment is very easy to push the price of"
"2275620","2275780"," spy. "
"2275780","2280000"," And we also know in the options chain, we can do that as well, right?"
"2280500","2283080"," I'm not asked, but we know that larger entities can do that as well."
"2286370","2290790"," On low volume days, they can move the price of spy to where they want it."
"2291990","2293910"," So we're going to discuss that at some point today. "
"2293910","2297910"," I think we might focus on that as we're going into a long weekend."
"2298950","2302510"," I need to have that out there in detail."
"2302510","2307830"," So that I want you to come back and say, I understood the risk. "
"2308610","2309450"," I got blown up."
"2310510","2312510"," Like this is to the upside or downside, right?"
"2313650","2317230"," So if we like moon, you at least understand."
"2319010","2321030"," We talked about this a few weeks ago. "
"2321290","2329790"," Can your strategy withstand a trip to 420 or even 430 and then roll back down or not?"
"2336700","2338160"," Yeah, I feel so good right now."
"2338640","2342740"," I had a really, really good morning here."
"2343080","2344060"," I made a lot of money. "
"2344740","2349120"," I feel really good."
"2355060","2357080"," Just trapping people in here."
"2357180","2357580"," You see that?"
"2358260","2359200"," Just trapping people. "
"2361220","2363560"," Just trapping them all in there."
"2366700","2370440"," That's FOMO gang and that's bear gang in there."
"2379370","2380750"," That's who that is down there. "
"2382830","2387390"," One minute remaining or leading with the, I'll be leading with the U.S. pending home sales change."
"2390130","2396450"," And then they just sold a bunch of puts on NVDA, right?"
"2396450","2397830"," And like really high prices."
"2398290","2400690"," And they just ripped NVDA back up again. "
"2403510","2405950"," And now they're going to kill that put premium."
"2408570","2411870"," That's barking says the U.S. is still at the tail end of the pandemic."
"2411990","2413310"," A dislocation to the economy. "
"2414070","2414990"," Oh man."
"2427020","2428720"," It's like a perfect layup."
"2429520","2430160"," Ten seconds. "
"2439860","2447240"," If you made money on the either NVDA or a synthetic trade on NVDA, congratulations."
"2447900","2450980"," The U.S. pending home sales are coming in flat at zero percent."

"2461840","2465080"," The U.S. takeover of Credit Suisse gets EU antitrust approval."
"2466500","2468720"," I harped on this yesterday and the day before."
"2469880","2471680"," I do not like to short strength. "
"2473240","2476180"," I do not like to short strength."
"2476660","2479180"," There are too many easier plays out there."
"2481860","2485560"," We've gone over in the show when you finally get that role in the daily. "
"2486780","2489520"," You can short that right that when you get that big bear plane."
"2490120","2490720"," That's confirmed."
"2491400","2492200"," It's an easy trade. "
"2493100","2495500"," You can do it for six months, nine months a year."
"2496720","2497580"," Easy trade."
"2498540","2499960"," Showed you what it looked like on our K."
"2500860","2506060"," You should look at our K with a 27 EMA and a one 29"
"2506060","2510960"," EMA. "
"2510960","2513580"," Well, that's when you short AI."
"2514320","2518120"," We have posted out the pending home sales April reports on the feed for those interested."
"2518720","2519560"," You do not. "
"2519900","2523360"," So pending home sales were unchanged in April month over month."
"2523500","2527060"," Contract signings improved in three U.S. regions but dropped in the northeast."
"2527840","2531880"," Pending home sales fell in all four regions and compared to one year ago, however. "
"2532920","2535680"," You do not need to do that."
"2535680","2538400"," You know, as time passes, right?"
"2539080","2546140"," As 10 passes, you're going to realize that the people that say they are doing that more than"
"2546140","2546660"," likely."
"2547960","2549840"," Are shorting paycheck to paycheck. "
"2552580","2553380"," They're lying."
"2554340","2555720"," They've gotten blown up."
"2558520","2560280"," You'll see some good shorters out there. "
"2560320","2561000"," There's people on Fintuit."
"2561140","2562440"," There's a guy who posts."
"2562840","2563860"," I'll try to find out this one guy. "
"2563860","2567020"," He picks easy ones and it's always a winner."
"2567440","2569000"," He's like, here it is three months later."
"2569580","2570580"," Try to get his name for you. "
"2570900","2574720"," He's a bear and he's like, wait to identify it."
"2574960","2576340"," There's 15,000 tickers, right?"
"2576820","2578500"," He's just like, there's one right there."
"2578720","2580960"," And months later, still going down. "
"2584600","2587200"," It's the same as knife catching for a bull."
"2587660","2589880"," There's no need to catch a knife as a bull."
"2589880","2593520"," There's so many tickers that are just already being moved up and repriced. "
"2595380","2597200"," Why waste your time catching knives?"
"2597460","2599280"," There's just so much out there."
"2600980","2603080"," There's no need to catch a knife."
"2603940","2612560"," I think it has to be, it must be some kind of internet cred or something like, ooh, I called"
"2612560","2612860"," it. "
"2614700","2619200"," And the reality is, if you're trying to make real money, no need."
"2620280","2622100"," Wait until the trade sets itself up."
"2622660","2623300"," Take the trade. "
"2624560","2627780"," And the easier the trade is, the happier you're going to be overall."
"2636960","2652720"," NVDA now trading 384.21. So"
"2652720","2656560"," yeah, so we'll leave that at that."
"2657140","2659520"," Anyways, we're sort of talking about the debt ceiling. "
"2661620","2662520"," Give me one second."
"2662640","2664100"," I need to grab something so we can talk about it."
"2664100","2664900"," I'll leave it. "
"2665020","2666260"," Maybe, maybe I can right now."
"2667160","2668080"," Let me see if I can."
"2672810","2674010"," They might have it right here. "
"2694680","2699440"," So punch bar reports that White House and Republicans discuss the debt cap lift through 2024."

"2760140","2761740"," It's worth $19 on the VIX."
"2766300","2767660"," We got up to 1952."
"2771080","2779420"," Let's begin. "
"2784220","2786960"," Feds barking says the labor market is quite tight."
"2796860","2799080"," We wanted to take everyone to try to find this for you."
"2831460","2833140"," And you're not about to save this for tomorrow. "
"2833420","2834300"," I'm about to save this for tomorrow."
"2834300","2834760"," I'm about to save this for tomorrow's show."
"2843580","2845160"," I'm going to save this for tomorrow's show. "
"2845260","2845340"," I'm going to save this for tomorrow's show."
"2845340","2846840"," I want to make sure that I have this exact."
"2847180","2853220"," Twitter citing one of their colleagues says top Republican negotiated grave states. "
"2853220","2856260"," They don't have plans to return to the White House on the debt ceiling."
"2856820","2862440"," Quotes that we've made clear that we're willing to meet any time to get this resolved."
"2862840","2866180"," And I think we began seeing a little bit of movement yesterday. "
"2868400","2872140"," It's a consolidation right now in the S&P 500."
"2889760","2893500"," They bought a ton of fucking calls again today."
"2895440","2897400"," I can't believe how many people buy calls. "
"2899640","2901620"," We get so much FOMO in this market."
"2901960","2903000"," Bull bear doesn't matter."
"2904440","2907160"," I can't believe how much FOMO there is. "
"2910660","2914880"," Yeah, I was going to talk about a topic just now and I'm not comfortable."
"2916200","2918260"," You know what I'll do is I'll write it up tonight."
"2919500","2920960"," Try to make clearer sense. "
"2920960","2925400"," You use behind on training workers for skilled trades, labor demand and skilled trades."
"2925420","2926520"," It's still crazy hot."
"2927340","2929020"," And I'll have it ready for you tomorrow. "
"2929380","2929760"," I want to talk."
"2929860","2930940"," I want to discuss it right now."
"2932060","2933180"," But we need to discuss. "
"2933560","2935180"," Well, there's like a two part discussion."
"2935840","2941260"," The first part of the discussion is if the debt ceiling is solved, what is the initial reaction?"
"2942200","2945820"," And then is there fallout afterwards?"
"2946760","2949540"," Where's price of the S&P 500 while that's going on?"
"2949540","2955840"," And there's some, in fact, Jenny Marcus this morning brought up this book that we've brought up"
"2955840","2956600"," here in the stream."
"2956880","2965720"," It expects further increase in LNG purchases to 155 BCM in 2023 after the 45 BCM year of year"
"2965720","2968380"," increased to 120 BCM last year. "
"2969480","2974480"," And we discussed to this book on stream two or three times in the past week."
"2977600","2981120"," And he's discussing chapter one."
"2982080","2984020"," He's like you should go back and read that one. "
"2993100","2995560"," Let's see if I can find the exact section."
"3007650","3012090"," This House Speaker McCarthy says I take the tune first as the deadline for the ceiling."
"3013630","3017870"," Yeah, you know, I'm going to have to pull some exact sections out of this because he bounces back"
"3017870","3019290"," and forth between in 1999. "
"3021070","3022710"," So I'm going to need, I'm going to need a day."
"3022870","3026550"," I want to make sure they have, I want to make sure that's clear and concise for you."
"3027490","3030810"," I want to do it right now and I'm like, that's better to, better to piece it all together. "
"3035320","3038020"," Then kind of have like a mixed bag of all of this."
"3042610","3048770"," We do have a three trigger bear cluster here price target down below for 12, 12."
"3049670","3051990"," Right here right now should check it out in there and tag it. "
"3058130","3076780"," Four, 12, 12 price target consolidation, baby."
"3086160","3086520"," Nice."
"3086720","3088460"," Curlo said he just the micro dose right on. "
"3090180","3092740"," Yeah, I'm going to try to make it clear for you guys."
"3092940","3097280"," I don't want to, I don't want to give you guys, I'm trying to give you guys some, some detail"
"3097280","3099180"," stuff and I want to make sure I do it right."
"3104980","3106680"," Yeah, big old gap down there. "
"3117600","3119660"," Dude, and they're still adding calls here."
"3119800","3126480"," These savages, like who's buying calls here?"
"3130340","3132660"," I'm like, who is buying calls here?"
"3150220","3154560"," Nothing we can't go up."
"3154640","3156300"," I just wouldn't be, I'm not buying calls here. "
"3157000","3158160"," Yeah, and no business."
"3160240","3206160"," As you"
"3206160","3210540"," guys did show up in my, I posted this morning asking how many of you were in that stream yesterday"
"3210540","3211820"," and there was a shit ton of you."
"3216660","3218400"," Congratulations if you made money overnight. "
"3218980","3223520"," That's barking says demand is definitely calling in part because it was over stimulated during the"
"3223520","3223980"," pandemic."
"3239690","3246010"," And that's barking says that rate hikes are also helping reduce demand as it as is a credit"
"3246010","3247570"," tightening due to bank failures."
"3253640","3259220"," McCarthy is saying these instructed negotiators to work 24 hours a day to get a debt ceiling deal"
"3259220","3259580"," done. "
"3262540","3264300"," Negotiators work well past midnight."
"3349170","3351010"," We read through your chat right now."
"3353900","3358680"," It's barking says demand is demand cooling as rates rise and credit tightens. "
"3362760","3363900"," Yeah, I'm bearish here."
"3364040","3364520"," If anybody's wondering."
"3369530","3375870"," It's trading above the hourly five minutes and the one minute consolidating looking for a move"
"3375870","3376170"," higher. "
"3376370","3378630"," It's trying to break out and trade 1998."
"3381110","3385610"," It's being reversed in its channel right now, but it's it's it'd be."
"3386770","3388030"," It's not the place here. "
"3390910","3393110"," U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary and again."
"3393250","3395790"," It says we are making progress in debt ceiling negotiations."
"3398370","3398970"," What's going on?"
"3399030","3399390"," Where are you wrong?"
"3399570","3399930"," What's up, brother?"
"3401470","3402070"," Well, I'm missing. "
"3402330","3403610"," I'm trying to get into the chat right now."
"3404650","3405210"," Where are you wrong?"
"3405350","3405870"," What's going on, man?"
"3409960","3410660"," Oh, thanks."
"3412420","3412740"," Thanks. "
"3412840","3413140"," I'm a buyer."
"3415680","3416420"," I'm missing."
"3416760","3417760"," Hey, where are you wrong?"
"3417880","3420140"," Where are you wrong?"
"3420140","3421840"," Where are you wrong?"
"3421920","3426960"," I've got a question when viewing charts on lower or lower timeframes. "
"3428080","3430300"," We always use the extended trading hours."
"3430740","3431240"," I do."
"3431800","3437160"," So why do I use extended trading hours is I'm looking for pivots and gaps. "
"3438140","3439480"," Always pivots and gaps."
"3440840","3441680"," So I'm always."
"3442660","3446580"," I'm always checking higher and lower timeframes throughout the course of a day. "
"3446580","3447300"," You should too."
"3447400","3449860"," So if you're a trader out there, there's a bunch of stuff you need to be doing."
"3450160","3460160"," So you should be always looking at the VIX, Dixie, HYG, and sometimes TLT, TNX, TTR, or what do"
"3460160","3460620"," I miss here?"
"3461420","3461860"," There's something else. "
"3462940","3467980"," I also check sectors for rotation of the S&P 500."
"3467980","3471300"," Even if you're trading tech, you should be checking those."
"3472460","3474540"," Dr. Copper is another one to add in there. "
"3475160","3476800"," Oil is another one to add in there."
"3478000","3480040"," And how they relate to your positioning."
"3481660","3483560"," But it's stepping away from that, right?"
"3483720","3485200"," These basic tools. "
"3485880","3488680"," Those are like hammers and wrenches and screwdrivers."
"3489060","3490200"," You have to do that stuff."
"3491160","3495160"," But another hammer wrench or screwdriver or wrench would be something like that. "
"3495160","3499240"," But much is unknown about COVID's impact on hiring and the labor force."
"3501220","3502380"," Is timeframes."
"3505940","3507200"," There's other things too. "
"3507660","3509880"," Checking SPX versus ES versus Spy."
"3510620","3512820"," Even if you're trading tech, it doesn't matter."
"3513880","3515660"," You have to understand what the S&P 500 is. "
"3516000","3519400"," And especially if you're even if queues are outperforming."
"3520780","3525240"," Like synthetically, I'm trading NVDA or Google or whatever."
"3525580","3527200"," You need to understand the mechanics of the marketplace. "
"3527940","3531980"," Looking now to the fear and greed index, currently sitting at 63 out of 100."
"3532340","3533080"," That indicates greed."
"3533740","3538280"," While the crypto fear and greed index is at 51 out of 100, which indicates a neutral. "
"3539700","3543140"," When it comes to timeframes, I'm always cycling through the daily."
"3543800","3546280"," The four hour for like a super trend."
"3548020","3551460"," An hourly for a one to three to five day trend. "
"3551920","3557060"," A 15 minute trend for a day, day and a half."
"3557940","3560860"," Five minute trend for are we."
"3562640","3565360"," Directionally in one head one way for that day or not. "
"3566640","3570620"," And then of course a one minute trend when I'm day trading for like scalping."
"3571200","3573640"," I trade a one minute chart and you're not supposed to, but I do."
"3573640","3579340"," A lot of people get tunnel vision and they're only watching a one minute chart or they spend so"
"3579340","3581440"," much time in a one minute chart that they're like, we're going to crash. "
"3582380","3584380"," Because the one minute looks like we're crashing, right?"
"3584600","3587620"," But then you scale out a little bit and you go, oh, a little bit of breathing room."
"3588520","3594280"," I even look at the weekly chart and I will look at the monthly chart for even higher timeframes."
"3594740","3596900"," Can we actually crash here?"
"3597060","3598020"," Are we supposed to crash here?"
"3598760","3603300"," Is this a low on a ticker that only comes every three years?"
"3606160","3609920"," And then with extended hours when I'm breaking all this down, right?"
"3610300","3615060"," Every morning I'm looking at finding previous highs and lows in gaps. "
"3616280","3616800"," Right."
"3617080","3620220"," We're running mathematical calculation to get S one to S two S three."
"3621040","3623220"," And then our one are two are three. "
"3623580","3625280"," You can do our four and S four if you like."
"3625960","3626480"," Right."
"3626700","3627380"," So I do all that stuff. "
"3628180","3634780"," Places that are most stressed in the CRE space is larger downtown buildings and there's a lot of"
"3634780","3635460"," pain in that space."
"3636140","3639680"," And then of course I'm checking what other people are trading to, right?"
"3639940","3643380"," So I'm looking for Elliott wave kind of stuff, right?"
"3644520","3646000"," I'm looking for."
"3647120","3651260"," I'm looking for, of course, things that happen to your question. "
"3651800","3653560"," Things that happen in pre market."
"3653560","3659960"," Things that happen in the overnight hours that might not show up in an extended hours chart like"
"3659960","3660780"," this stuff right here."
"3662280","3668220"," There might be you get your highs and your lows from your pre or after hours than your pre market,"
"3668220","3673240"," but there might be some highs and lows that don't show on this chart. "
"3673300","3677620"," You might have had like a bloodbath that recovered and you don't actually see where that tick is"
"3677620","3678100"," down here."
"3678960","3681140"," And so why am I showing extended hours?"
"3681140","3684360"," Yes, on the prior of 99 BCF as well."
"3684520","3690540"," We do expect comments from Collins who participates in a fireside chat at the community college of"
"3690540","3691120"," Rhode Island. "
"3691580","3695400"," So text is expected as well as a Q&A with the moderator and the audience."
"3695980","3701140"," So I leave extended hours up so that I can see where the pivots are where the pre market high"
"3701140","3703100"," was pre market lows."
"3704060","3709680"," We tend to the algorithms will tend to ping pong between them up down up down in tag. "
"3710500","3716660"," All of these gaps, not they leave some behind, but they tend to go up and erase all of these"
"3716660","3717980"," things throughout the course of a day."
"3728090","3735670"," You'll hear people on Fintuit, they'll say, we're going to go to 410, 57 and a half, right?"
"3736030","3738330"," And you get it to the tick and you go, how'd they figure that out?"
"3739390","3741070"," How are they able to call the tick on that?"
"3741490","3743110"," And it's because they're looking at pivots."
"3746900","3749000"," Now there's other guys, now they do GEX, right?"
"3749080","3749900"," We're talking about GEX yesterday. "
"3751240","3752740"," GEX changes throughout the day, right?"
"3752920","3755960"," So if you're the best data, you're going to see where all those GEX lines are, right?"
"3758440","3762960"," And people trade different systems, but eventually you get there, right?"
"3763100","3764420"," At some point, normally."
"3778230","3780890"," Yeah, that's pre market and pre market affects them."
"3780890","3788250"," Even so H and pre market effect, if you're going down, pre market is kind of important for me up"
"3788250","3788690"," in the upside. "
"3788910","3798200"," I guess that pre market is important in the upside, but sometimes I've gotten burned before with"
"3798200","3802480"," moves made on ES in a futures market."
"3803560","3809160"," I'll forget to pay attention to futures market and I'll be like, oh, we're going to bounce right"
"3809160","3809380"," here."
"3809380","3812540"," And then we blast through it and I go, where the fuck was that line?"
"3813600","3818240"," It's usually in fucking after hour, not after hours, not after hours market up. "
"3819000","3820480"," The futures market, Globex."
"3827020","3835990"," Yeah, good question."
"3845030","3849050"," Super pool old man says, cap, is it weird that every day, no matter how much I grab on short"
"3849050","3852570"," term plays, my deli P&L always manage to go back to zero by the end of the day?"
"3852570","3857330"," I think market makers say every day you can't make money and knows my longs and other plays then"
"3857330","3857930"," takes it back. "
"3859690","3861010"," I can't answer that."
"3861190","3865050"," You have to tell me when you're making entries and when you're making exits, the prices that you're"
"3865050","3868490"," paying, the rules that you're using that kind of stuff."
"3871790","3875990"," The two biggest or three biggest things, or maybe like the four or five biggest things that I've"
"3875990","3876330"," ever seen. "
"3878810","3879490"," Mistakes made."
"3881490","3883590"," Well, size is an issue."
"3884570","3885850"," There's a bunch of rules that I have. "
"3888810","3894950"," If you're an investor or new trader or new investor, I always recommend that you stop trading"
"3894950","3898770"," individual tickers and you learn how to trade the S&P 500."
"3899590","3902830"," You learn the basic mechanics of the S&P 500."
"3905830","3907670"," And you start there. "
"3909490","3915330"," And the second thing that I would recommend always, not always, now some of you are going to tell"
"3915330","3918750"," you to find stocks better or buying the S&P 500 is the best."
"3919730","3921890"," On a low right and you're always going to make money."
"3923150","3926630"," But for me personally, spreads are your friend. "
"3927430","3930130"," It's like step one is I'm going to trade the S&P 500."
"3931030","3934590"," Step two is stop fucking buying single options."
"3935350","3936350"," What's calls, I don't care. "
"3938530","3942070"," And the third point I would make would be time frame matters."
"3942710","3943850"," So if you're losing money, right?"
"3944650","3948810"," If you're if you're losing money in this market, like stop trading, stop investing."
"3951670","3957370"," The options industry console org and immerse yourself in their in their educational program. "
"3957510","3963450"," Community College of Rhode Island, the text is expected as well as the Q&A from both moderator and"
"3963450","3963910"," the audience."
"3964590","3967850"," I'm going to put the link out to the life of video on the feed for those interested."
"3969950","3972730"," The second thing I would say would be a bunch of other stuff I would say would be I have"
"3972730","3973250"," different accounts. "
"3973890","3976070"," If I buy I have like short long term holdings."
"3977430","3978830"," And then I do different trades."
"3979690","3983170"," How I make most of my money like substantial amount of money is with spreads. "
"3984470","3988030"," When we're in oversold conditions on higher time frames."
"3989510","3994990"," I will often miss the rest of that trade where I could have made max profits."
"3996490","4001070"," Due to that strategy, it limits how much money I can make, but it's been the most consistent winner"
"4001070","4001490"," for me. "
"4002270","4008630"," And that leads me to the next point would be you have to find a consistent method that makes you"
"4008630","4011130"," money no matter what in the most simple way possible."
"4012070","4014310"," Usually in my in my experience."
"4015130","4017590"," The S&P 500 goes up. "
"4019350","4025270"," And it's very clear when the market capitulates much clearer than when it rolls."
"4028010","4031070"," So for me personally, I do call spreads."
"4032170","4036970"," When we have a liquidation of every sector in the S&P 500. "
"4038010","4041610"," They don't come often, but when they do come you'll know it."
"4042950","4050450"," If we get to 20% bullishness on every sector, like if we're at like 70% bullishness, 60%, 40%,"
"4050450","4051430"," 30% nope."
"4052170","4058010"," If we hit the 20% bullishness, we will have a liquidation trigger and the market will liquidate"
"4058010","4061990"," down to 6, 7, 8, 9, 12%. "
"4063450","4068510"," Every time that happens, even in a stock market crash, they buy the market."
"4069810","4072870"," It's the only time that I can guarantee."
"4073790","4078130"," And I don't care if there's a fucking nuclear war going off, they're gonna buy that shit. "
"4079010","4083010"," I don't know why they buy it, but they do every time."
"4085670","4092830"," And if you can enter into a long at that point and train yourself to not listen to the noise,"
"4093690","4095490"," you'll become very successful."
"4096010","4101410"," And then, you know, if you want to day trade or we trade or day trade, and let's say you"
"4101410","4104670"," made 20 grand and you want to take 500 of it. "
"4105569","4106810"," And trade that $500."
"4107350","4109810"," If that 500 you can compound that to $5,000."
"4110750","4113870"," You take that five grand away and put it into that other account. "
"4114609","4116069"," And you restart again at $500."
"4118390","4126450"," You don't take like 500, make 5,000, then roll that into a $5,000 trade and then roll that"
"4126450","4129609"," into a $10,000 day trade and during the week, that kind of stuff."
"4130130","4130750"," You don't do that shit. "
"4134410","4136109"," That's another thing that happens in the stream too."
"4136350","4141029"," I think that people like full port 100%, like I made a thousand bucks."
"4142290","4143370"," How much did you start with?"
"4143910","4143970"," 500. "
"4144529","4145510"," Okay, you made a thousand bucks."
"4145670","4145750"," Sweet."
"4146029","4146270"," Congratulations. "
"4147029","4147910"," What's your next trade?"
"4148550","4151850"," Well, I'm putting $1,000 down on this next trade and I'm like, oh, fuck."
"4152310","4152810"," Is it a weekly?"
"4153609","4154130"," Is it a daily?"
"4154410","4155050"," Is it a zero day?"
"4155210","4155609"," What is it?"
"4155830","4156450"," It's a one month."
"4156750","4157430"," I'm like, okay. "
"4158450","4159590"," Is there blood in the streets?"
"4160029","4160149"," No."
"4160609","4163670"," I'm like, dude, you're like, you got a thousand bucks to your name."
"4164350","4165990"," Slowing demand lowers the inflation. "
"4167149","4170689"," You get $1,000 to your name and you're running like these high-risk trades like that."
"4170910","4171130"," That's crazy."
"4171790","4173109"," And then you're doubling and doubling and doubling. "
"4174130","4177430"," It has to be like a guaranteed winner, back-tested winner."
"4178330","4179390"," I'm right back to get a site for this."
"4180609","4181729"," Let me see if I can find it right now. "
"4183109","4185729"," So you should have a strategy, any strategy."
"4186029","4188350"," I don't care what it is, selling, buying and fucking spreads."

"4211590","4213330"," I want to tell you what the strategy is."
"4214450","4216510"," Whatever that strategy is for you, right?"
"4218690","4223750"," You can make out of 10 trades. "
"4226350","4232850"," That strategy, if you're going to have one loss, that's it, one loss."
"4234630","4236350"," Right, where that trade blows up."
"4237690","4239390"," I mean, blows up, zero. "
"4242740","4247440"," Feds Collins says the US inflation rate is too high, showing signs of easing."
"4248100","4250640"," Rate pauses give space to assess actions to date."

"4277960","4282300"," If you take 10 trades, you can have one major loser."
"4283420","4286660"," You can have three that only make 30%."
"4286660","4288680"," That's four, right?"
"4289100","4292840"," Then you need to have between four and six that prints you at least 100%. "
"4294320","4296520"," It's not an easy thing to do, is it?"
"4296560","4299380"," Rate of data while deliberating next rate move."

"4304180","4307460"," You could have six that print a hundred percent. "
"4308320","4313820"," But that mix is critical for you because you have to pay taxes on that fucking money."
"4314100","4316140"," You have to pay money to have that money."
"4316660","4321360"," You can't run some people like, oh, I run a strategy where I make 20% every trade. "
"4321940","4322900"," It's an easy winner."
"4324340","4331720"," But that ninth or that 10th trade, they blow up that one and that one cost them 60%, 80%"
"4331720","4335260"," of all those 10 trades combined, and they're back to zero again."
"4336400","4342460"," So you have to back test your strategy and you have to ensure that it continues to make you money. "
"4343360","4347420"," And you're not rolling into like 100%, 100%, 100% until you blow up."
"4348920","4356680"," I'm going to recommend a site called tradewell.com."
"4358260","4363020"," We have also posted out the weekly EIA natural gas reports on the feed for those interested."

"4704980","4706240"," I also know that."
"4707240","4708240"," When price. "
"4710380","4712320"," Right there price is above."
"4712940","4714800"," The daily trigger the weekly trigger."
"4716600","4721020"," And the monthly trigger that the market is in normal. "
"4721340","4722120"," It's normal."
"4722680","4723460"," It's been normalized."
"4726220","4728080"," This is a low volatility environment. "

"4745760","4746960"," It's like I guarantee it."
"4748320","4749800"," I know we're going to kill the VIX."
"4749960","4751340"," And I know that we're not going to crash. "
"4753340","4755320"," Because this is what it looks like."
"4755940","4757120"," Price above daily."
"4758200","4760420"," Daily above weekly and weekly above monthly. "
"4761780","4762160"," I know it."
"4763180","4765160"," I can make some assumptions from that."
"4766180","4769760"," One assumption would be we're going to kill the fucking VIX. "
"4773180","4774100"," Dips will be bought."
"4776200","4778660"," Threat of a crash is unlikely."
"4781020","4783020"," We don't have any confirmation of a crash. "
"4783580","4785180"," Even if we roll below this stuff."
"4785840","4789220"," We still need confirmation in the daily to roll down below the weekly and the monthly and all that"

"4792160","4793520"," Every fucking time. "
"4796460","4799500"," So the we can get long in the tooth and daily velocity."

"4817040","4819200"," So when we are down here."
"4819200","4821800"," This green these green columns down here. "
"4821800","4824120"," When we're a bit max bearishness down here."
"4824120","4826140"," I can likely make a trade to the upside."
"4827520","4829440"," When we're max bearishness down here. "
"4829660","4833100"," I can then again likely take a trade to the upside."
"4833980","4836620"," When we're max bearish again."
"4838060","4841340"," I can likely take a trade to the upside. "
"4842220","4842780"," Now."
"4843320","4847840"," The best part of being max bearish here is you can also see something else."
"4848720","4852180"," When the max bearishness is becoming so if I have. "
"4852600","4857960"," Minus 50 max bearishness on the hourly while we're in a bull market not bull market but bull trend."
"4858400","4860340"," Now we're on a bull market we are in a bull trend."
"4861840","4864360"," I know that if I get down to minus 100. "
"4864940","4865980"," That's bearish right."
"4866380","4867580"," Then it goes to minus 50."
"4868180","4870420"," So we're not going minus 75 minus 100. "
"4870720","4871240"," We're going."
"4871360","4875860"," We're going minus 75 to minus 100 then minus 75 then minus 50."
"4876980","4878960"," We're probably bottoming. "
"4879740","4882200"," We can probably buy this dip."
"4883180","4886220"," With some kind of high probability of printing."
"4888260","4893800"," And we just had that happen yesterday into the end of the day. "
"4894440","4895980"," Now the question becomes."
"4897040","4900580"," Can we roll down once more we did here right."
"4901020","4902120"," We got a print this morning. "
"4902800","4903760"," Can we roll back down."
"4903760","4904700"," Fuck yeah we can."
"4904960","4905980"," Can we roll right here. "
"4906600","4907040"," Look at that."
"4908320","4908720"," Right."
"4908900","4910020"," Can we roll that down there. "
"4910160","4913300"," Close out four oh four four oh three and then take the next trip up."
"4913720","4914600"," Hell yes."
"4915620","4917480"," We roll down here and go back up. "
"4917600","4918240"," Yes we can."
"4919300","4920380"," See we did it right here."
"4921320","4924200"," One more roll back down but we knew we could buy that dip. "
"4926300","4931200"," One thing for the bulls right now is we have not seen this up side yet though."
"4931200","4931780"," Have we."
"4933320","4936220"," We haven't seen that yet right that big push higher. "
"4937660","4939540"," So right now I'm positing."
"4940140","4942860"," That I can buy a dip down here you can see it right here."
"4943440","4945160"," So there's another one I made money on. "
"4946100","4947000"," Let me slap."
"4947240","4949700"," Let me slap another fucking W there."
"4950440","4950900"," Bam. "
"4952000","4953040"," 350 PM."
"4956020","4957380"," Proved itself to me."
"4960140","4961120"," So here. "
"4961960","4963740"," What am I looking for."
"4965140","4966420"," To get long."
"4968500","4969520"," Up here. "
"4972060","4973460"," For that move right."
"4974660","4975860"," I need price."
"4976900","4977580"," Two. "
"4980360","4981640"," Right now right."
"4982120","4986340"," I need a trade above to four fifteen and confirm once again that the move is higher."
"4986340","4988320"," And set that trade trade up. "
"4989960","4990440"," Right."
"4990600","4990980"," What is that?"
"4991220","4992260"," It's at a four."
"4993340","4995440"," Four fourteen and change somewhere in there. "
"4995540","5001880"," Post reporter via Twitter says leader skilies as the issues are narrowing in the debt limit talks."
"5003920","5005620"," So that's what I need right."
"5005860","5008020"," I need to see that for the move higher. "
"5009880","5011760"," I don't want to get caught in this kind of nonsense."
"5011760","5018940"," And I also can make a positive that if we trade above there I probably have a day or two."
"5019400","5020800"," Maybe even three days. "
"5021200","5022800"," Take that trade."
"5025400","5026000"," Right."
"5026280","5029840"," So do I need that trade where we are right now. "
"5030120","5030480"," Fuck no."
"5032000","5035220"," Like this trade should work itself out for like."
"5036640","5038740"," If I'm in a chart this trade. "
"5040060","5042360"," This trade will work itself out."
"5052100","5055180"," For the rest of the day probably into tomorrow."
"5058220","5060980"," So all I need here is price. "
"5061960","5063780"," Ready to break above."
"5065980","5069120"," Boom and confirm start to head higher."
"5070240","5072280"," And I can jump on that train. "
"5075060","5081960"," What I can't have happen is price to jump up and then break back down here in bloodbath right."
"5083400","5086000"," I need some confirmation that we're going up."
"5086340","5089240"," I need these with this white line this red line to come up with me. "
"5091060","5091600"," Right."
"5103300","5106540"," Do I need to buy this tick down here."
"5106900","5107440"," Fuck no. "
"5109320","5113900"," They can buy this trade here from here to here but you know like people that do this shit."
"5114520","5118100"," They don't have they don't have nine out of ten winners or eight out of ten winners."

"5123840","5124480"," test the shit. "
"5126880","5127280"," So."
"5129160","5132560"," For me there's like there's there is a trade in here but it's very dangerous."
"5136040","5140960"," We used to trade that shit on this channel but we're we're people are blowing up this shit like"
"5140960","5141660"," every day. "
"5143700","5150360"," Like I'd enter here you'd enter here I'd exit here and you would like it roll over and you'd be"
"5150360","5151560"," upside down again so."
"5152340","5153480"," We don't do that anymore."
"5155680","5162120"," Three trigger blue a bull cluster on the one hour five minutes and one minute. "
"5162920","5166060"," Daily trigger underneath starting to get pretty bullshit."
"5167680","5171540"," We will see if it works itself out."
"5176480","5180820"," On the upside we have a gap above at four nineteen forty two. "
"5182640","5185100"," And we never got to four thirty did we."

"5218900","5224700"," Warning bull cluster DT four one two three four trigger bull cluster right here. "
"5226860","5231380"," Stream bullishness we're going to see if we can come up and bounce and hold this trade to go"
"5231380","5231660"," higher."
"5232860","5234540"," We should start squeezing here in just a few minutes."
"5239960","5242420"," First target above is four fifteen thirty two. "
"5243380","5245020"," Right here that's your pre-market high."
"5245920","5247900"," We have our three at four fifteen sixty."
"5248780","5251240"," We got a whole ton to the upside. "
"5254680","5255420"," Of shit to revisit."
"5258100","5262920"," Do you imagine being like inputs right now or short right here you just like feeling the pain."
"5277930","5283870"," You took the money and ran on the bell printed yourself a thousand percent. "
"5284930","5288030"," You re-enter with like thirty cents again."
"5289810","5292230"," Just a just a free fucking trade."
"5306060","5310780"," Briefly discuss percentage account size taken on zero dates by so for me. "
"5311500","5313200"," I make large trades."
"5314260","5320460"," That make me sometimes six figures at least six try to get at least six of them a year."
"5323840","5329080"," I take anywhere from five to ten to twenty thousand dollars depending upon the market. "
"5330100","5333560"," And I will start with that account size like five grand."
"5334060","5336640"," And I will attempt to make five five thousand bucks."
"5336720","5337800"," I'll try to make twenty or thirty. "
"5338240","5339420"," I'll remove that money."
"5340620","5344140"," As terms of total size of my accounts it's like one percent."
"5346100","5350180"," There's other things here too like then I take the money out of the stock market completely and I"
"5350180","5351620"," put it into fucking real estate. "
"5353380","5357740"," My wife does shit with like money market accounts shit whatever she does."
"5358500","5360020"," I'm at the boss of that shit."
"5362300","5364140"," There's like other steps along the way. "
"5366040","5367660"," And I remove the money from the market."
"5367940","5375380"," A lot of like problems with week or day trading shit that people encounter is it's the only thing"
"5375380","5375820"," that they do."
"5377160","5379880"," They don't remove their fucking money from the market. "
"5381040","5382660"," And that's their trading account."
"5383200","5383980"," I guarantee."
"5384760","5388960"," I guarantee that a bunch of you out there are like I got three hundred thousand dollars in this"
"5388960","5389880"," account right here. "
"5390440","5392500"," And I trade that fucking thing all the time."
"5392900","5396280"," Thirty thousand dollars hundred thousand dollars fifty thousand dollars."
"5396620","5397400"," You're fucking teed. "
"5399840","5404780"," When you're trading frequently like hey I'm going to take money out and trade with a smaller"
"5404780","5405400"," account like."
"5406060","5409980"," I'm going to go back and only trade the thousand bucks or five hundred bucks or three thousand"
"5409980","5411260"," dollars people don't do that shit."
"5411260","5413680"," They're like they're like I'm a baller. "
"5413780","5416960"," And then they fucking make one bad trade."
"5417040","5419260"," It's all gone poof gone."
"5420800","5422600"," And then I sized into trades too. "
"5422840","5425560"," So I'll start with 10 contracts."
"5426000","5427920"," I used to buy like 300 contracts."
"5428120","5433380"," I'd be like my opening trade was like 300 like the max max fucking trade that you can do on"
"5433380","5434700"," a brokerage like 300 contracts. "
"5435320","5438260"," Then I'd add another 300 then another 300 then another 300."
"5439180","5440540"," I don't do that shit anymore."
"5440940","5444660"," I'm like 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 work into a hundred. "
"5444920","5447100"," Especially if my thesis is right my timing is off."
"5447520","5450470"," Ten minutes away now as we get the Kansas City Fed Composite Index."
"5451640","5458120"," Forecast minus nine on the prior of minus ten on the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Store prior of"
"5458120","5459020"," minus twenty one. "
"5459560","5464260"," My thesis is right but I'm like I'm directionally right my thesis is right but there's one more"
"5464260","5465060"," drop or something."
"5465060","5470180"," We're going to roll over and we squeeze up one more time and we're still going down and we're like"
"5470180","5470700"," fuck that."
"5470760","5472120"," I'm going to grab another hundred contracts. "
"5472680","5476580"," If I'm in for like 50 for 20 cents I'll then throw a hundred on."
"5477460","5478200"," You know what I mean?"
"5478780","5480420"," And DCA into a position."
"5481980","5483240"," If my thesis is right. "
"5484080","5487320"," If my contracts have been burned I'll sometimes leave them on until they go to zero."
"5489440","5493540"," But yeah managing sizing is my thesis right or wrong."
"5494680","5498300"," Sometimes I will break even on a trade. "
"5498840","5504240"," So sometimes I'll be upside down in a trade I'll be like say enter for 50 cents."
"5506320","5509200"," And it goes all the way down to 10 cents."
"5510100","5515020"," And I'm doing everything I can like DCA and diamond handing whatever that is. "
"5515120","5518900"," And then I get up and then I come back let's say to that 50 or whatever it is after"
"5518900","5519380"," DCA."
"5520120","5521020"," Like break even."
"5521940","5527480"," If I've spent like 15 20 30 minutes four hours you know like it goes down then it eventually comes"
"5527480","5530500"," back up and fights its way up and I'm like break even here. "
"5531500","5533300"," I will actually exit the trade."
"5534260","5539380"," I won't I won't like try to make that trade print for me and then I look back on what"
"5539380","5540200"," my decisions were."
"5540900","5543800"," And I don't like I don't like being. "
"5545320","5548180"," I don't like like I'm like sloppily trading."
"5549960","5554760"," I get back to like break even I will just stop the trade because that wasn't my thesis right my"
"5554760","5556340"," thesis was start printing."
"5557180","5561200"," Or like it's going to print the next five minutes or ten minutes start printing or when we're"
"5561200","5564600"," closed or whatever like it should start making money right away. "
"5565200","5568320"," If you're out there buying or buying or selling I don't care buying or selling."
"5569120","5573080"," And you're like fucking losing money on that shit for like a day or 30 minutes or."
"5574320","5576840"," Your entries are wrong right my entries are wrong. "

"6790520","6791180"," Somewhere in there. "
"6793860","6798480"," And I opened an account and then actually closed it had an account I had my first account on"
"6798480","6798700"," Twitter."
"6799600","6804020"," And then I closed it and I was like well when I do an account for just me."

"6982160","6984740"," Ripping faces off right now to the upside. "
"6985100","6989920"," Trading for 1463 trying to blast through this group of sellers."

"6998780","7001540"," This is the guy that came in the market this morning. "
"7002500","7003840"," And he read."
"7005580","7006800"," On fin to it."
"7007700","7009460"," His buddies told him you sell this. "
"7010840","7012180"," He's going to tell you."
"7014400","7016700"," That he sold this took the money and ran."
"7017060","7020320"," I bet there's like 30% of these people did take the money and run. "
"7021780","7023200"," But I bet you 70 didn't."
"7025820","7027840"," Now we're coming back up and he's getting squeezed."
"7028340","7029780"," And he paid big money for these puts. "
"7031640","7034740"," So he needs to now go down way down here."
"7035080","7035540"," He has to."
"7046710","7048350"," Nope, I'm not in anything right now. "
"7049790","7050690"," I'm in zero."
"7052290","7053030"," I am flat."
"7053570","7055130"," I'm looking for what?"
"7056410","7057330"," I already showed you guys earlier, right?"
"7058270","7059010"," You want to break above?"
"7060770","7063890"," I want a successful retest. "
"7065930","7070830"," And set up some calls once we begin to move higher."
"7081180","7083940"," That's one pissed off seller right there."
"7089420","7092120"," That's one really pissed off seller right there. "
"7131550","7134250"," That's a really angry seller."
"7135150","7135930"," See him?"
"7136630","7138410"," That one bar right here, he's like."
"7138410","7138650"," That one bar right here, he's like. "
"7139710","7140270"," Sell."
"7142870","7147010"," Like, you know, 70 Sam is up here just trying to pound this down right now."
"7159940","7161180"," You know who they are. "
"7161360","7162280"," I mean, you can tell, right?"
"7162440","7163080"," They do it all the time."
"7163240","7164360"," You can tell who makes those calls."
"7165000","7166480"," There's a bunch of guys like that out there. "
"7166640","7167720"," You guys want to know a few of them."
"7169100","7170700"," So there's like Jedi Marcus."
"7172820","7174100"," He speaks in tongues. "
"7175520","7178880"," But if you understand what he's saying, he's telling you his positioning."
"7181040","7182440"," Without telling you his position."
"7183320","7186980"," Another good one is SPZ underscore trader. "
"7189920","7193900"," I want to also what you know, you might not like all these people's politics, but it doesn't"
"7193900","7194160"," matter."
"7194440","7195500"," These guys come out there."
"7195640","7197060"," There's a group of them that trade together. "
"7199820","7200920"," Who else is another good one?"
"7201020","7202880"," Double wide cap is a good one."
"7203020","7204140"," Double wide cap is a great trader."
"7204620","7208660"," Froggy trades is another trader that's out there doing his thing. "
"7209360","7211880"," I'm trying to think of a few more."
"7211880","7215000"," But that whole circle of volatility is another great one."
"7215560","7217540"," That's a whole group of traders with that. "
"7217700","7221160"," Froggy's his own thing, but who does another guy out there?"
"7221360","7223820"," The SPX, the ass face guy."
"7224240","7225060"," He's a great trader."
"7225460","7228040"," He always tells you prior to what he thinks is going to happen. "
"7229460","7231860"," Another key point about those people on Fintuit."
"7232620","7235060"," You have no business yelling at those people."
"7235620","7241080"," If somebody out there like those handles I mentioned, if they make a bad call, you got no fucking"
"7241080","7242340"," business going after those people. "
"7242460","7243720"," Those people are fucking ballers."
"7244320","7248280"," The fact that they put that stuff out there, if you're going to go after somebody in Fintuit, go"
"7248280","7256180"," after the people that are like, after the fact are like, they show you like fake winnings or, they"
"7256180","7258340"," say something after the fact, but not before."
"7258700","7261920"," Like anyone that's out there actually trading and dropping some science on you. "
"7262440","7263280"," Like, PELK is awesome."
"7264080","7264700"," Life of PELK."
"7265700","7266940"," ST short seller. "
"7267460","7267940"," Another great one."
"7269200","7270260"," Follow out there."
"7270680","7274480"," They lay out concepts for you before it happens. "
"7274960","7275540"," Before it happens."
"7276720","7279960"," If it doesn't work out for that, it doesn't matter."
"7280560","7282980"," You don't want, you don't be following the people that are afterwards. "
"7283320","7285940"," Like always before."
"7286940","7287520"," That ceiling."
"7288020","7289540"," Jeffries to speak soon. "
"7290860","7292000"," And if they're wrong, they're wrong."
"7292320","7293540"," But at least they're coming out before."
"7294220","7299840"," And then from that point, if you, let's say that group of people on Fintuit, you're going to find"
"7299840","7302980"," out from that point forward if they're actually in that position or not. "
"7303220","7308840"," So if you see the same person, if you see the same person that's like, market crash, market crash,"
"7309080","7313140"," market crash, before it happens and it doesn't ever crash every time, you fucking stop following"
"7313140","7313580"," that person."
"7315740","7320990"," But you'll be able to find them."
"7321090","7322710"," There's like little groups of traders out there. "
"7323670","7325130"," And some of them speak in tongue."
"7325470","7329190"," You know, they're like, they don't explicitly say I'm longed this or I'm short that."
"7329870","7333110"," As a matter of fact, there's a great as a friend of mine out there, right?"
"7333230","7333710"," His name is. "
"7333990","7337350"," 6% in June slash May on reduced output."

"7342550","7344090"," His name is Baba Yaga."
"7345210","7347770"," And he's a super fucking bear, right?"
"7348070","7348630"," He was awesome."
"7349110","7352190"," He, he knows when I'm exiting longs. "
"7352530","7353170"," Every time."

"7354710","7356990"," He knows the exact moment that I'm out. "
"7357150","7358850"," He knows when I come on Finn to it and go."
"7359290","7359690"," Bear."
"7360110","7361770"," I just made a bunch of fucking money. "
"7362890","7365810"," And he's like, it's time to short the fuck out of the market."
"7366010","7366430"," He's done."
"7370350","7370870"," You know?"
"7378150","7379550"," He knows what I'm entering. "
"7379850","7380610"," And he knows what I'm exiting."
"7380610","7384610"," And he's like, we're like, like, I'm like checking out."
"7384770","7390150"," Like I'm like, like it's like, it's like the, uh, when the Wiley Coyote and the Shepherd dog are"
"7390150","7392410"," coming to work and excellent and leaving work every day. "
"7392530","7394230"," I'm like punching out and he's punching in."
"7395670","7396110"," Yeah."
"7404830","7408390"," Yeah, I still have no clarity here if it's up or down. "
"7409770","7414350"," Uh, I want to see what I'm looking for here now is these bars to come up."
"7414350","7418510"," If we start to get these bars, I do have a trade set up here."
"7419210","7421750"," So I want to see if this, if proves itself or not. "
"7422990","7424710"," Still not proving itself to me."
"7427710","7429990"," And I got plenty of time to enter this shit."
"7430170","7432950"," So I got plenty of time here. "
"7439360","7440140"," Yeah, he's not."
"7440360","7441520"," Bob is a super fucking bear."
"7441660","7441860"," I agree. "
"7442060","7442880"," But he's not dumb bear."
"7443160","7445520"," Like if you're a bear out there, I want to say something."
"7445720","7447500"," If you're a bear, go out there and find Baba Yaga. "
"7447500","7448720"," He's a gangster."
"7448720","7450960"," He's a fucking baller fucking trader."
"7451260","7452460"," Baller fucking bear dude. "
"7459460","7460440"," Ruthless bear."
"7471020","7471860"," Ruthless bear."
"7472080","7475480"," If he's, if he's slumming around, you know you have to be careful. "
"7488190","7489410"," Oh, no shit, huh?"
"7491730","7493710"," Well, I mean, but you know what I'm going to say?"
"7493950","7496350"," I understand why he blocked you too."
"7496610","7498810"," Like a good trader, man."
"7499030","7501050"," You tell a good trader that they're wrong. "

"7537110","7537690"," I promise you. "
"7539430","7542230"," Like an active trader that makes money has an ego."
"7542230","7546950"," Probably behind a closed door somewhere, even if they're zipping it up and burying it."
"7547270","7548550"," That's why they're fucking traders. "
"7549050","7551710"," They think they're smart."
"7552190","7554610"," They fucking know they're smart."
"7556490","7558670"," They risk money on that bet. "

"8409410","8418660"," Places trades based on this right here Here's like thousands of them All across the United States"
"8418660","8428320"," all across other countries and They look at shit like this and they're like Come on here"
"8432940","8441820"," And I know that they look at shit like this and they're like, oh, okay, we got early recession here"
"8442700","8452460"," Right We have full recession over here And these guys know Investing and financing resilience and"
"8452460","8453260"," renewal in Europe."
"8453780","8460540"," We have posted out the live video on the feed for those interested These guys know that when we're"

"8513750","8525220"," if you look at KRE They already put their shorts on See"
"8525220","8533900"," that And then we came into what were probably the big the middle part of a recession and they want"
"8533900","8543320"," paid And this little squeeze higher is not paid And as we're exiting financials, they need a"
"8543320","8552240"," catalyst to get their Bloodbath and their capitulation so they can then get back into a New cycle"
"8552240","8561780"," when they reenter financials And guess who else knows this like guys like Bill Ackman"
"8562520","8569120"," They fucking know this it's a cycle They're like we've been short for like three months need that"

"8576660","8577200"," Does that make sense?"
"8579540","8584520"," Then you get up some other smart guys and they're like well, you know regionals aren't where they"
"8584520","8591340"," need to be And you get other smart people like Barry these guys know does that make sense?"
"8592140","8597440"," So when you when you see these when you you're looking for these things you're like, okay, so that"
"8597440","8599640"," they're selling Financials regional banks."

"8702430","8708570"," Is it guaranteed that we're gonna get a role from this?"
"8710330","8719190"," Not guaranteed 25% chance we get a role 25% chance not only is there a 25% chance"
"8719190","8727230"," we get a role There are there are large players positioned for that role You got banks positioned"
"8727230","8735370"," for that role Even if we don't get the crash to 2,800 because of it they're gonna still want"

"8787610","8794810"," if the debt ceiling is solved There's risk even hedging that you know and I know That there's some"
"8794810","8801770"," manipulation in the market if you have It's definitely probable that we could squeeze up on that"
"8801770","8808430"," news to 430 and then roll the market down Right grab some liquidity you get the initial move up."
"8808790","8810010"," You're in fucking shorts."

"8843330","8849730"," about your day be aware of the risks If we're trading 430 and we get a deal a debt sale"
"8849730","8854390"," of the elements ceiling fucking deal I would expect us to just start selling immediately."
"8854850","8859510"," I'll be honest with you I think we just start selling if we're hit here at 410 we get a"
"8859510","8860150"," debt ceiling deal."
"8860350","8867150"," I bet we go up I'll be honest with you very go up And then we roll But you know"
"8867150","8874070"," like price matters where we are on the market matters If the market does roll over you will likely"
"8874070","8880150"," have an opportunity to short it I've shown you the white and red line on a daily chart you get"
"8880150","8887770"," the initial roll over The market tries to get itself back above Right make some new highs if it"
"8887770","8888650"," fails we go back. "
"8888770","8898350"," We roll back over and down So you have some time in there To account for that risk if you're"
"8898350","8907850"," a stockholder hey, I hold stocks you can buy a Putback spread right you can take that by I guess"
"8907850","8914430"," you're buying and selling but you can you can you can Structure a putback spread in case we get"
"8914430","8918910"," that squeeze all the way up on the initial news And then we roll it back down to the depths"
"8918910","8922130"," of hell It's like being short even put spreads."
"8922130","8931350"," I don't like them I like put back spreads for this specific risk and specifically I like put back"
"8931350","8939890"," spreads on IWM More so than spy spies a little bit more resilient than IWM is So if we have"
"8939890","8946790"," debt ceiling risk IWM putback spread probably your best bet And as a matter of fact, it's in a"
"8946790","8953370"," great fucking place for it It's in like perfect place for a putback spread To hedge whatever"
"8953370","8954530"," positions you have in the market."
"8954750","8961970"," So let's say let's say I own stock Right I can put a putback spread in IWM to hedge that"
"8961970","8968250"," position If you're like oh cap I'm not getting a putback spread and you're a stockholder the only"
"8968250","8974270"," thing I can tell you is you just ride through it You ride it out If it's a month three"
"8974270","8980750"," months, whatever it is for you to get back to your last previous Positioning you just hang tight. "
"8981230","8989150"," I do not under any circumstances If you're not hedged and the market goes down and the last thing"
"8989150","8997190"," caveats of this would be If you're not hedged and you're in some positions of risk You could get"
"8997190","9002770"," caught in some repricing if you're like him long S&P 500 You're probably safer than other people"
"9003350","9009490"," Sometimes when we do that those big moves down there is repricing on spec growth that'll never come"
"9009490","9012210"," back ever again So some risk there too."
"9012650","9022650"," So anyway, it's put back spreads IWM is a way to literally Turn off All"
"9022650","9031170"," the noise of risk from A debt ceiling agreement that could be bearish you could literally just find"
"9031170","9038250"," that person that's doing that and just turn them down The moment you put that put back spread on"
"9038250","9044410"," because if we go up it's gonna pay for you if we go down on that news It's gonna print"
"9044410","9052310"," three four five hundred percent for you put back spreads and Then you can just put the air muffs on"
"9052310","9061610"," and fucking stop listening to him You don't need to listen to him your hedged You're gonna print if"
"9061610","9069150"," we go down you're gonna print if we go up It's gonna offset If you own the underlying stock and"
"9069150","9075950"," your hedged and we roll over I'll let you know You can start selling calls against all that"
"9075950","9083590"," underlying that you own OTM calls as we roll down You make money from that so you're gonna make"
"9083590","9090890"," money on the on the market that you've already bought on Selling OTM calls as we roll down you're"
"9090890","9098690"," gonna be hedged and be printing money And so whatever that person out there saying to you on social"
"9098690","9103350"," media the news CNN CNBC Fucking JPM doesn't matter."
"9103430","9111530"," You don't care Because you're hedged If you're not that person if you're like, well, I don't own"
"9111530","9112150"," these stock cap. "
"9112310","9121730"," I'm a day trader now you have very low risk A very low risk You may lose one trade"

"9129910","9134190"," ceiling risk Let's just pretend I'm in calls right now, right?"

"9144470","9149070"," trade shouldn't be a hundred percent of my account should it shouldn't be 50% of my accounts"
"9149070","9151630"," Shouldn't be 25% of my account, right?"
"9152710","9157370"," And if I lose that one day trade, it's like any other fucking day in the market and if we"
"9157370","9165750"," roll down I can pivot And start to make money on that trade To the downside Does that make sense?"
"9166310","9170250"," So if you're a day trader, right and you're a bull day trader the fuck do you care?"
"9171510","9178010"," If the market crashes What the fuck do you care you can adjust to that?"
"9179330","9185010"," Pricing of rate cuts is overly optimistic Your job is to trade the market that's in front of you"
"9185010","9192610"," trade the price action that's in front of you and And if at any point your thesis is wrong You"
