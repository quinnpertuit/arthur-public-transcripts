"6700","7620"," Check one two."
"13070","13890"," Test one."
"16250","16770"," Check. "
"17690","23120"," All right, what's going on here?"
"34440","35140"," As well."
"60520","61960"," Good morning out there."
"62120","62800"," How's everybody doing?"
"65350","67210"," What I got going on here?"
"67310","67890"," Memory card. "
"67990","68230"," Can I have a look at it?"
"68230","68470"," I'm going to play."
"69330","69890"," Come on."
"70030","70570"," Tell me it's on. "
"71670","72770"," How y'all doing out there?"
"73870","75090"," Bring it right over real quick."
"75270","76570"," We'll go right to the mainstream here."
"77290","81030"," We're not going to waste too much time with the intro this morning. "
"81950","82830"," Let me just second here."
"82830","84890"," I got to do one quick thing."
"92930","94750"," Go over a few things this morning. "
"95870","98250"," You can see we regained the pivot point."
"98590","101270"," I said that you would see us be flat by open."
"101270","105390"," We've been close enough for hand grenades and horseshoes, I'm assuming. "
"106110","109470"," If you're a bear, you better have sold off that bell if you had puts."
"110750","113610"," I did post that this morning on Twitter."
"114350","117190"," You are seeing a trade higher off the bell this morning. "
"120320","121760"," It's like magic, right?"
"122220","124100"," You should have expected the same."
"124920","126420"," We'll talk about that here in just a minute."
"132520","133300"," Hold on. "
"139240","140960"," Just a second here."
"149130","150070"," All right."
"152410","153870"," So much to do in the morning. "
"153970","154130"," Okay."
"154850","156470"," So let's look at a few things here."
"156870","157170"," Good morning. "
"157310","158170"," How's everybody doing out there?"
"159050","160350"," Everybody doing well this morning?"
"161610","162410"," All right."
"162750","164410"," So it's weird."
"164810","168750"," PPI came out and the tweets that I saw were brutal. "
"169490","171750"," The tweets were a doom and gloom."
"174410","176490"," The one thing I would say is this."
"177350","178590"," I think I think. "
"178850","183010"," I probably made a good comment as well about this yesterday."
"183890","185870"," If you're just looking at this chart right here, right?"
"186770","192630"," Yesterday we talked about I showed you yesterday that I showed you yesterday that the"
"192630","200830"," dealers are pretty much trying to."
"201690","204530"," Rain in the market into CPI. "
"205070","205250"," Okay."
"206510","210810"," That was a key point yesterday was they're going to try to stabilize it into CPI."
"212590","219150"," Now, regardless of what what PPI was this morning, had you seen a rip higher today?"
"219550","222670"," You'd more than likely be see selling into strength still. "
"222670","225670"," We saw that yesterday twice, right?"
"225810","229330"," We saw selling a very strong moves yesterday in the stock market."
"229970","235210"," And I think we had more buyers and sellers in the moment that we that we traded up high enough."
"235210","238730"," You saw that trigger in selling into strength. "
"239310","246330"," GS yesterday zero heads made a comment or been opposed yesterday saying that GS was not selling"
"246330","249890"," into strength block trading into strength in regular market hours."
"249890","251210"," We know that's not true."
"251250","253030"," We could see it yesterday. "
"253270","258370"," You could see it in the into the bell yesterday and you can actually see it in the bell as"
"258370","259430"," well the day before."
"260529","266190"," We made notes here in the program about that that you're seeing this like this unusual selling"
"266190","268990"," activity only triggered into any kind of string."
"269690","272710"," We said yesterday under normal circumstances, you would see a rip. "
"273610","277830"," First day after you you'd see a kind of a gap up here gap up there."
"278010","282530"," We talked to on this day on this day here this last day I said to you, you might not"
"282530","285510"," see a rip until Friday or Monday, right?"
"285850","287390"," We're seeing that play out."
"289090","290330"," Now, all week long. "
"290990","292350"," We've seen it all week long."
"292610","296610"," You see the battery port come in and then here's the other side of it."
"296610","300310"," Remember the other night we were awake at one two o'clock in the morning. "
"300850","302870"," We're watching futures."
"303450","311610"," Globex were watching the sell off into the touch the small and peepee down below of the quote"
"311610","312390"," unquote channel."
"313170","318210"," And there were no buyers down there and out of nowhere you saw you saw buyers step in and stop"
"318210","320450"," the market from crashing, right?"
"320450","324110"," This was I think this was this night right here. "
"324130","325230"," I'm not exactly sure."
"326190","329230"," And so you're seeing the stabilization of the market."
"330330","333930"," I'm going to show you some I'm going to show you some SPX skew this morning. "
"334370","335170"," We're going to go into that."
"335630","339830"," We have a couple things to talk about about the or the."
"341110","347830"," We'll talk about the volatility that's priced into the event and the volatility drop in SPX as"
"347830","348890"," these events unfold. "
"349770","353230"," We're going to talk about that today so that you can we're going to go through a few things that"
"353230","357090"," are important to money and stuff like that, making money."
"358810","362930"," So my only point to you is this is that unless you see real money selling, right?"
"365570","369270"," For real money buying, you're going to see the market be supportive into."
"370770","375010"," Well, supportive, but stabilized into CPI and JPOW. "
"375390","381270"," Even if you had a kick ass PPI, you're not going to see this extend possibly."
"382370","387810"," I was saying yesterday, if this was Tesla, you'd possibly see these higher tags above here."
"388090","389690"," You know, the head and shoulders you talk about, right?"
"391410","393050"," And that you would see more muted. "
"393570","397670"," You would see this be more muted into CPI, not so high, right?"
"397670","402230"," It's not it's not it's not our SPX spies not."
"404250","411490"," Doesn't trade with the volatility that you'll see like an individual ticket like like Tesla trade"
"411490","411690"," at."
"411990","414270"," So the good part is that you got. "
"415530","420950"," You got 38 or 38.2%. I think is what this this target was."
"421730","423330"," And we we got it."
"423330","427030"," So you can't really complain, especially heading into CPI. "
"428450","430050"," Especially heading into FMC."
"430770","432510"," For bulls, I would take that as a win."
"433770","435570"," Even though it's sold off before the bell. "
"435890","440390"," Now you're going to hear the drum beats from bears right now, which you should bears have a win,"
"440470","440730"," right?"
"441610","443150"," Bad CP or bad PPI report."
"443470","444790"," We'll talk about that today as well."
"445110","446570"," Some people are saying that's a good reporter. "
"446890","448330"," This is good information on it."
"448590","449710"," It doesn't really matter."
"451130","452530"," Bad news can be good news. "
"452770","453610"," Good news can be bad news."
"454750","456890"," You can see we're still trading right in here."
"456970","457490"," Do you see this?"
"458410","459230"," Why right?"
"459570","464110"," Why regardless of the news, are we still trading in this in this range in here?"
"465070","465510"," Right?"
"465990","466510"," See that?"
"467870","471510"," Now if we start getting we start getting real money selling, you'll see it. "
"471590","473130"," You'll see it in the in the dome."
"473490","474750"," Let me bring this up real quick."
"475710","476530"," You'll see it. "
"476650","477190"," You'll see it in this."
"479570","480730"," See the buyers down here."
"480810","481710"," More buyers and sellers. "
"486300","491700"," If you see, I promise you, if you see real money selling, right?"
"492020","492320"," We'll know."
"493080","493720"," We'll see it."
"494900","495480"," Hold on. "
"495540","496320"," I'm going to mute this again."
"499840","505640"," If you start seeing real money selling this imaginary demand down here, we'll demand it right down"
"505640","505780"," here."
"505860","506220"," We'll break. "
"506420","507320"," We'll start heading lower."
"507320","513919"," If you're a bear and you want to see this market burn, you got to see this demand disappear."
"514520","516179"," You want to see that rug pull down below. "
"516440","517120"," That's the same for the bulls."
"518260","521900"," I heard hearing even yesterday and today at this morning, I heard comments that we'll see Sporro"
"521900","522380"," 550."
"522700","525580"," I'm like, not unless those sellers still aren't there. "
"527400","527720"," Right?"
"527860","529620"," The same thing goes for the demand that's down below."
"530260","532860"," You're seeing that play out past three sessions."
"534560","535600"," Just be conscious of that. "
"535600","540840"," We're going to look at some Valscue on SPX today and what to expect."
"541700","543780"," I want to talk to you about the hedge today."
"544900","546020"," The S Dow hedge. "
"547500","549460"," I know some of you have been in it for a while now."
"549620","550980"," Some of you have just been getting into it."
"551200","552700"," I had some DMs yesterday a day before. "
"553560","554480"," I know what I said to you."
"554780","555500"," What did I say yesterday?"
"555800","559420"," I said, this is a good place to put a hedge on, right?"
"560480","561160"," We had a top yesterday."
"561180","562720"," I said to you right here. "
"562800","563640"," I said, we could go up here."
"564560","565580"," Right here is not bad."
"566700","571020"," If you're in that hedge at this point, you should be up a little bit at the open today. "
"571560","575980"," I want to talk to you about that because there's volatil..."
"575980","577720"," Excuse me, my voice is cracking."
"580880","586460"," There's implied volatility into CPI, but specifically JPOW."
"586760","588160"," We're just talking about volatility in here. "
"589280","591180"," You got people making bets left and right."
"591320","593800"," They're like, market doom, market doom, market doom."
"593900","594820"," We're going to have a market crash. "
"596520","601380"," The top of the big down channel for the entire year is rolling over."
"601980","603600"," No matter what we're going down."
"604200","604980"," There's no saving it. "
"608590","610570"," So what you end up doing is..."
"612630","616770"," In a simple way of explaining this is you've got a lot of people betting, right?"
"617110","618670"," There's a lot of volatility betting in here."
"619410","622850"," A lot of people taking large positions, call side, put side, doesn't matter."
"623830","625210"," You get a lot of tension in the market. "
"625390","627990"," You can feel it on social media, right?"
"629310","632850"," Market participants are all calling, you know, we're going up."
"633450","634490"," We're going down, right?"
"635610","636610"," Everybody's taking sides."
"637370","638530"," It's like this really nice soap. "
"638670","640370"," I really like the soap, I believe it or not."
"642770","645070"," Now, if you put a hedge on, right?"
"645470","651150"," If you had put a nest out hedge on, any time above here, if you're able to get some on"
"651150","653030"," over here, right?"
"653670","655950"," And as we work down into that volatility, right?"
"656610","658890"," It's going to be breaking that vault, two things."
"659710","662970"," You're going to get a breaking volatility after, or not here, but..."
"665250","667490"," So you've got people putting on hedges up here, right?"
"668350","670330"," You've got people putting on hedges up here, right?"
"673250","675590"," And you're going to get a breaking volatility here. "
"675590","682730"," You'll get some re-pricing for further down the line, premium spike if the market starts to crash."
"684190","686410"," Let's say we don't even know."
"688070","692510"," Just putting that hedge on anywhere in here as we run into these events. "
"694390","701790"," Regardless if we go up or down, you can probably monetize that hedge, pull it off the market, and"
"701790","707550"," collect money because if I bought ten, you bought ten, someone else bought a hundred."
"708650","711710"," So the guy starts adding three hundred, then the other guy adds five hundred."
"712690","715190"," You're going to see that price go up no matter what, right?"
"717370","722890"," So you can probably cut that hedge off here, and a quick scalp on a hedge. "
"723830","725630"," So you can ran into that hedge after."
"727230","731550"," You already know where the bottom is, and you already know they're going to re-price once the"
"731550","733930"," volatility is gone in that event."
"734090","737730"," I'll show you a chart with that volatility as that volatility collapses, right?"
"740210","746390"," And if we start to trade down, you'll start to see premium kick and farther out dated put"
"746390","746810"," positions. "
"748010","748730"," Make sense?"
"749970","757110"," If we start to trade up, you'll start to see a premium kick in call positions after the event, you"
"757110","758170"," have ball crush, right?"
"758170","761350"," You'll still get ball crush even if the market goes down."
"762610","766610"," So if you're in any of these hedges we've talked about, we've been talking about these hedges for"
"766610","767090"," how long now?"
"767210","767450"," Two weeks?"
"768930","775110"," So if you've picked any of those hedges up, I want you to know that as we head into Monday,"
"775110","776270"," because it's Friday today, right?"
"776790","781450"," As we head into Friday, as we head into Monday, not Friday."
"781670","786050"," It's Friday Tuesday, the weekend, and into Monday and Tuesday, you're probably going to see,"
"786570","792410"," regardless of where the market, if the market stays even just flat, you're more than likely going"
"792410","795530"," to see some premium building into your position. "
"796410","798570"," You're going to see it grow a little bit, okay?"
"800430","807330"," And if you do see that, it's not a bad idea in case they re-price after these events so"
"807330","808830"," that you can come back in and buy them cheaper."
"809750","815010"," Maybe aware of that, if you have a hedge in the market, that is not a spread, let's say."
"815910","823470"," If you have just a, not naked, if you own, not naked, well, I guess, on my end, I've got"
"823470","833550"," calls, and I don't know if they could make the put, but on an inverse ETF, like"
"833550","839650"," triple leveraged, double or triple leveraged or quadruple leveraged ETF against the market. "
"839650","840910"," I really don't care what happens."
"842250","847530"," I care more about gaining the money from the volatility leading into the event."
"848810","852610"," So consider that as we head into chew on that over the weekend. "
"853730","856290"," If you've put that hedge on, take a look at your hedge."
"856730","860670"," I'll be taking a look at mine at some point into the end of today."
"861610","864150"," I'm also grateful that I didn't take a position yesterday. "
"864350","868750"," We were talking about, are we going to do puts or calls into the belly yesterday?"
"868750","870910"," I'm so glad I didn't hold anything overnight."
"874010","875910"," So let's take a look at the market real quick."
"877530","879310"," We know we've got the pin at point here, right?"
"883650","885290"," I'm going to show you this pin at point here. "
"887610","888790"," And right in the middle again."
"890190","891110"," This is almost right."
"891250","892010"," What time is it right now?"
"893350","895610"," It's 9.57, it's been a half an hour. "
"898440","900120"," And we're just under."
"900300","903440"," We actually tagged higher to yesterday's close."
"904680","905320"," What trade?"
"905480","906660"," We're stabilizing right here. "
"906820","908240"," I mean, this has got to suck your bear."
"908680","913680"," If you were a bull, when we had gone up, I would have told you the same thing to sell"
"913680","915380"," those calls at right at the bell."
"915920","921420"," Because they more likely would have dumped it right straight down back to yesterday's close. "
"922860","928440"," That makes you guys all tracking that out there in a YouTube world."
"929660","930800"," Good morning, everybody."
"938490","939150"," Let me go through. "
"939590","940770"," I'm reading some of your chat right now."
"940830","941830"," I'm going to go through here in just a minute."
"942430","943370"," I just want to be aware of that. "
"943450","950190"," Now, for the day today, if we're doing day trades in the S&P 500, day trades in the stock"
"950190","950830"," market, right?"
"951790","956330"," You're going to know that you're not going to find wild swings in Spy right now, okay?"
"960120","963320"," So it's just like every other day right now heading into the weekend."
"963500","965560"," There's a couple of things I want you to realize, though, okay?"
"966320","968760"," There was a year in the past decade or so."
"968880","971040"," There was a holiday massacre. "
"972740","974580"," I touched on it briefly yesterday."
"975960","981160"," I said to you, there was a PPI report that came out on a Thursday."
"981160","985980"," I might have said CPI, but it was a PPI report that came out on a Thursday. "
"987800","990480"," I think on a Thursday or Friday, I think something like that."
"990500","991020"," It could have been CPI."
"991280","991880"," I don't know exactly. "
"992100","992360"," I remember."
"993580","998080"," But I do remember that they did start relentlessly selling over the weekend."
"998520","999840"," It was like Thursday or Friday. "
"1000080","1000360"," It just started."
"1000860","1001760"," It was so ugly."
"1003420","1008720"," By the time the FMC meeting came around like a Monday or something like that, Monday or Tuesday, we"
"1008720","1009120"," were down. "
"1010580","1010980"," Huge."
"1011600","1013240"," And then we went down even further afterwards."
"1014080","1017900"," It was a bloodbath right into, I believe, Christmas Eve. "
"1019620","1020620"," From the 24th."
"1020620","1021360"," It was really bad."
"1022620","1025280"," It was, it was, it was, it was, it was ugly. "
"1026020","1027359"," I'll try to find the year in that."
"1027599","1029020"," So just be conscious of that."
"1029839","1036240"," If you're a bear, if you, if you're looking for that to happen, like we were awake the other night"
"1036240","1036700"," for this reason. "
"1036700","1040859"," The other night we were looking for this breakdown here."
"1040960","1044200"," If we see that breakdown there, right, you don't have to be in it right now."
"1044240","1047840"," If you have the hedge on your fine, but if you're a bear and you want to bet that trade,"
"1048880","1050080"," then we start crashing the market. "
"1051260","1056840"," You should be, you should be in futures, trying to short this market below here."
"1057180","1058980"," If you can break below and hold it."
"1059100","1059200"," Okay. "
"1060260","1063720"," If it happens in cash, starts in cash market, you know it's on."
"1065120","1066800"," The same thing goes for above."
"1068180","1070440"," You've got huge supply up here. "
"1070580","1074840"," If you're a bull and you're looking for, if you're like, hey, we're going to 405."
"1075440","1079500"," Hey, we're going to, I'm like, hey, we're going to, my, my, I'll go somewhere going to 430."
"1081140","1083300"," But if I'm going to take that trade, it has to be above. "
"1083580","1084280"," You have to break above."
"1084500","1088780"," There's a little small window to break above here between now and Tuesday."
"1089620","1091700"," But you still want to see that move higher. "
"1092300","1093260"," Take that trade."
"1093720","1094020"," Okay."
"1094480","1097060"," We saw yesterday calls coming in for 410. "
"1097740","1100740"," Tons of them outweighed all those puts that came in yesterday."
"1101600","1105660"," But you still don't want to commit to this trade until that window opens, right?"
"1106160","1107680"," So you want this big window to open up here."
"1107700","1109220"," You want this big window to open down below. "
"1110060","1111400"," Name on which side of the trade you're going to take."
"1112920","1114980"," I want you to be clear on that."
"1116360","1118500"," You want, you want bigger, you're like, we're retail traders. "
"1118500","1124420"," You want, if you see like some big bank putting out 410 Z's, you see some bank putting out 300 "
"1124420","1125220",",000 puts."
"1125800","1126500"," That's what they do."
"1126940","1128260"," We're just here to take a little bit of that money. "
"1128680","1129460"," That's all we're trying to do."
"1133060","1137480"," Now right now at the point being held, VOps being held, there's one other note about today that I"
"1137480","1140940"," want to show you guys before you get started with the rest of the day."
"1141340","1146720"," And that is your, you're watching some expansion and implied moves. "
"1147520","1150240"," So yesterday we talked about, we said this yesterday, right?"
"1150240","1158480"," Watching the, watching the dealers start to give a range for what to expect into these dates coming"
"1158480","1158720"," up."
"1159420","1165100"," But you're also watching an expansion of where we trade, right?"
"1165320","1168380"," Where you're only expecting a move here and you're only expecting a move down here."
"1168800","1174640"," Yesterday you're starting to see some expansion in the S&P 500. "
"1174880","1178800"," You should expect to see that expansion into Monday and Tuesday."
"1179300","1181000"," Now for where we can trade too."
"1182980","1185340"," That's where we had this nice, the small trade range. "
"1186140","1188100"," You're going to start to watch this expansion happen."
"1188900","1190980"," I don't know if he gets, he gets this crazy."
"1191680","1194520"," I think they're going to sell into it if it does get that crazy. "
"1195400","1197780"," And they're going to buy into it if it gets too low."
"1198000","1198060"," Okay."
"1198560","1199540"," Just like they did this morning. "
"1200880","1206360"," You should see that as we head into, um, into Monday, Tuesday."
"1206360","1209740"," So in your charts, whatever you're looking at, I want you to just keep that in mind."
"1209920","1210000"," Okay. "
"1210100","1214280"," You're looking for a break below 3900ish changes every day."
"1214760","1217840"," It's roughly around there, 3910, 3920."
"1219000","1221400"," And you want to see it hold and start selling. "
"1222000","1223980"," You jump right in there and you'll be good to go."
"1225160","1226400"," Same thing on the upside."
"1226640","1228620"," You see that break above, right?"
"1228980","1230120"," There's this escape range. "
"1230800","1231980"," You're going to start taking that trade."
"1232640","1233660"," Does it make sense to go up?"
"1233660","1235100"," I don't care if you're a bull or bear."
"1235920","1236880"," I'm warning you. "
"1237060","1241280"," If you're a bull, you see that break below here, right?"
"1242520","1244200"," You're going to have a bad time."
"1244480","1246780"," Promise you to break, right?"
"1247000","1248600"," Rejection turns into resistance."
"1248800","1249420"," We move down. "
"1249860","1253560"," If you're still in a long position there and you're a bull, I promise you, right?"
"1253680","1255680"," You're going to lose every last dollar you have in that trade."
"1256520","1262840"," Same thing if if you're a bear and you see a break above resistance into support, and that means"
"1262840","1264340"," the market's going to start screaming higher."
"1265820","1270120"," I still have my bear suit on here, but you need to be able to switch the moment that happens,"
"1270120","1270480"," okay?"
"1274340","1275400"," Expanded trade and range. "
"1276840","1280800"," We've got pivot point, fighting for the pivot point to get higher right now."
"1281560","1289320"," See if we can, I can't really see the, yes, bull's working on, bulls are working on taking out"
"1289320","1291860"," this, this VWAP trade enough, this VWAP right now."
"1291860","1293800"," I'm not surprised by this at all. "
"1294300","1297220"," I'm not zero surprised by this at all right now."
"1299580","1302560"," I think this is the 50% mark up here, R3."
"1303140","1309240"," We charted this yesterday with what's 38%, what's 50%, what's 70%. "
"1310860","1312920"," You're going to see it head and shoulders."
"1320240","1321840"," I'll start reading what you guys are saying."
"1334910","1336930"," I'll come into some resistance right now. "
"1337810","1339030"," Bear's trying to throw it over."
"1339310","1340030"," I'm going to show you one more thing."
"1341590","1342910"," I'll show you one more thing. "
"1343010","1344650"," This is a case for the bears."
"1346170","1357360"," And when you guys are hyper aware of this, we talked"
"1357360","1358280"," about this, right?"
"1358800","1360260"," Ad nauseam, we talked about this stuff."
"1361060","1363080"," So that every day you're aware, hold on a second here. "
"1364560","1365800"," Probably a better way to showing it."
"1365800","1373690"," And I say bears."
"1373990","1376890"," I'm just using a bear is like a term for computers. "
"1377970","1379190"," This isn't retail traders."
"1379470","1380690"," This is computers, same with bulls."
"1381330","1381870"," It's just computers. "
"1382170","1383730"," It's like a heel and wrestling."
"1385070","1388650"," You make a wrestler look like they're the bad guy and they're not."
"1389470","1390830"," Just a guy playing a role. "
"1392510","1393570"," So you got to throw over there."
"1393690","1395210"," You got the bears coming straight in there."
"1395830","1396810"," Coming straight in there, right?"
"1397670","1398770"," Came back in here, right?"
"1399630","1400310"," Swooping down. "
"1402230","1403070"," Throwing it over."
"1404510","1405990"," Put slamming going on."
"1406270","1407730"," I want you to see it right here too, right?"
"1410670","1412450"," Bulls make good progress in here. "
"1412850","1415450"," Remember yesterday when they came in, tried to sell this."
"1415950","1417690"," Coming in again, trying to sell this right now."
"1417850","1419830"," A little bit weaker though, right?"
"1420950","1422410"," Maybe we can get up here today. "
"1424650","1425930"," Push them back a little bit more."
"1426350","1428070"," So they come in back again over here, okay?"
"1431900","1433240"," Just know that they're there."
"1434040","1435240"," It's important for you to know what happens. "
"1436300","1437120"," We break out, right?"
"1438020","1438680"," Break out."
"1438760","1440200"," They come in and slam it right down."
"1440360","1442440"," So just be conscious of them being up here. "
"1444560","1446540"," I want us wanting to slam it down."
"1458680","1472240"," I don't"
"1472240","1472740"," know what that is."
"1472860","1473380"," Let's throw that away. "
"1475880","1477800"," Yeah, 50% is right up in here."
"1480320","1483840"," I think this, I'll show you where the 50% is right here."
"1485220","1488040"," The 50% retracement on the original move down. "
"1492490","1493590"," I'm going to be honest with you."
"1493630","1494550"," I'm not expecting much today."
"1495770","1496610"," Today is Friday. "
"1496830","1503130"," I think that my expectation for today is the move was already made."
"1503470","1504210"," I'll be honest with you."
"1504790","1507990"," If you want to know what I think is going to happen throughout the day today, I think it's going"
"1507990","1509350"," to be like the sideways trade. "
"1510770","1515970"," Maybe build some vol into Friday for the weekend and then some more vol into Monday and Tuesday."
"1517690","1519550"," Maybe a good VIX trade."
"1523850","1531370"," Let's see what you guys are saying and see what"

"1853660","1856460"," window It's time of this on twitter this morning. "
"1856460","1858120"," There is a small window, right?"
"1861330","1871390"," There's there's a there's a small window where the bulls have a chance to rocket ship out Of"
"1871390","1879210"," this downward channel it would be a brief moment It would be some kind of like it could be like"
"1879210","1888950"," the my my my thought processes And opx and opx is involved in this as well If you see puts"
"1888950","1898310"," leave the market if you see bears leave the market and market sentiment shift from From this from"
"1898310","1905410"," this fmc meeting you can possibly this depends on policy shift This is the hawkish is a bullish and"
"1905410","1912750"," you know delicious bearish it You could have a market sentiment shift where the market literally"
"1912750","1917250"," creams up Um, I don't know that it hits 430 or 440."
"1917550","1924310"," I think Only it gets there, but You could get like the sentiment that it goes there So that"
"1924310","1931910"," sentiment could drive the market briefly for like let's say two weeks And if at that moment market"
"1931910","1938350"," had just come off if at that moment where we don't see the the spx vol skew Uh go higher,"
"1938590","1938630"," right?"

"1968690","1978690"," to come down like that And so if you see that if you see the hedge come off the market"
"1978690","1986850"," for that was two weeks um It does open the door for For lows in january and march."
"1987390","1996010"," I think we've discussed that here a couple times to expect a retest of those lows I posted Before"
"1996010","2002210"," we before I showed you the 200 day weekly moving average You should you can get that on trading"
"2002210","2011850"," view if you go on trading view open up, um I would open up specifically spx and Uh"
"2011850","2019150"," search their indicators for weekly moving average Pop that in there and you're going to look for in"
"2019150","2029050"," january or march a retest of that 200 wma That that retest will be the only door"
"2029050","2038630"," for you to have a market crash You can even find the instances in the past Like 2007 2008 2000"
"2038630","2046030"," 2001 1973 74 And a couple other spots before that. "
"2046150","2050750"," I want to say the 50s and 60s had one or two in the 1930s Had one where we were"
"2050750","2058210"," we were actually went below that weekly moving average distinctly Uh turned that into resistance"
"2058210","2069670"," and we we plunged Every time so you that would be your Trigger to say okay, we're we're um We're"
"2069670","2074929"," gonna have a crash You don't have to get you can get the trade down into there and I expect"
"2074929","2079750"," that trade down in there in january That's why I have that hedge on for march Expect that retest"
"2079750","2085090"," down below no matter where we go Whether we go down now or we go up to a higher high"
"2085090","2091989"," It still looks I no matter what I expect that retest to either rocket ship out out in a way"
"2092570","2094469"," Like that's our bottom our bottom down."
"2094650","2100790"," I think it's 320 3200 something like that Uh, that's either gonna that to me."
"2101010","2104050"," I want to see that test and then that rocket ship If I don't see that test I see a"
"2104050","2109250"," break below I know we're getting the mark crash Like that's like real money talk like making money"
"2109250","2117070"," money like What matters the most Uh, that's what I'm looking for Now so we'll talk about that the"

"5342220","5343540"," Let's start with jedi markets. "
"5343800","5349760"," So jedi markets talking about, um Exponential moving average using an exponential moving average"
"5349760","5360140"," for Now don't quote me on this Uh, but his his positive is that Um"
"5362600","5367800"," He's and i mean i might i might i might i hope i don't hack this up, but uh If"
"5367800","5376780"," you get a cross on the, uh, 21 day x potential exponential moving average, right You have a win"
"5376780","5384560"," rate of like 35 percent Watch my cursor as we as we cross over into the 20, right There's a"
"5384560","5390160"," win, right That we're going to go down the stock is the stock ticker is going to go down Right"
"5390900","5398080"," Now Sometimes it'll cross back over it'll it'll dump it'll cross over and then jump back up Let's"
"5398080","5405040"," say right here You would stay in the position, uh short let's say And then long at the same time"
"5405780","5411400"," Capture this money Close your long and then wait for the wait wait for your old short to stay on"
"5411400","5414860"," to actually Print that position does it make sense to you guys?"
"5415560","5425480"," I hope i'm not hacking this up The same thing would hold for across above Uh That the 21 day"
"5425480","5432000"," exponential exponential moving average so let's say you had a failure here if you had a failure Say"
"5432000","5439780"," let's say it failed down You would stay in that long Until and take and take the short and then"
"5439780","5445040"," and then as soon as uh the short Uh, would pay for your long Uh, but you leave this one"
"5445040","5451780"," on so until it came back up into the, uh, ema I Think he calls it the big green he's"
"5451780","5457760"," always called the big green line And this is what he trades off of So just to shout out to"
"5457760","5462140"," him if you guys go on twitter i posted it last night Uh, you'll see that i made a post"
"5462140","5467640"," about a paper that was written about how jedi trades About the bgl he talks about all the time and"

"5471980","5478680"," a paper on it, which is really cool Uh, and you can see here so so you want to put"
"5478680","5483740"," this together as a you want to put this together as a um, A snapshot right you snap different time"
"5483740","5489320"," frames And find out what's going on and you can see we're trading out of range right now right On"
"5489320","5497800"," a five-minute chart pulling away from what the algo is thinking right Now we're looking at a 15 "

"5505020","5505100"," right?"
"5505880","5511740"," Eventually you should over time come back into a range right even if you're trading outside Of"
"5511740","5516580"," range right now it should come back into an estimated move into the 15 minutes does that make sense"
"5516580","5520860"," to you guys the five minutes showing you oh no no no It needs to come back down the 50"
"5520860","5524360"," to 50 minutes showing you I have the directions up on this time frame, right?"

"5636030","5643150"," predictive enough over time Uh, it starts to lose its predictive qualities And I have more work to"
"5643150","5643610"," do in this thing."

"7065720","7068220"," Um, so so I'm trying to watch position here."
"7068420","7078030"," So If you're a bull you're looking for You don't want inflation to come down really fast"
"7079230","7089390"," If you start to see rapid deflationary pressure like Inflation just starts rapidly coming down You"
"7089390","7094310"," don't want to see that And I want to tell you why there's a couple of things bears should know"
"7094310","7103590"," this too if you start to see that Uh, they will re re-price the stock market There was a"
"7103590","7113590"," so part of why the star market went up so high Is because of inflation So Uh, they re "
"7113590","7118710","-price the reason we went up is because of inflation they'll be here like it's money supply More"
"7118710","7119210"," money in the market. "
"7119350","7120110"," That's kind of it too."
"7120130","7120670"," It's part of that."
"7121330","7130170"," Um, so if you see inflation moderate And have price acceptance For goods and services is another"
"7130170","7135530"," key part to this So like you want to see like um, the price of an iPhone stay the same"
"7135990","7137270"," You don't want to see the price. "
"7137270","7139010"," I'm gonna get above the fucking get stopped."
"7139150","7141850"," I was I'm holding here So i'm sitting here right now."
"7141870","7142890"," I'm gonna trigger a sell. "
"7143370","7147670"," I don't have a stop loss right now, but you see this view up right here If we stay i'm"
"7147670","7157190"," gonna stay in this trade until we break through here So If you see like the price of think about"
"7157190","7164850"," this if you're a publicly traded company like tesla, right They have tesla says Well, you know cost"
"7164850","7166690"," of We have got shortages."
"7166730","7172390"," We've got uh, cost of this has gone up the cost that's gone up and so Our car that was"
"7172390","7182570"," $50,000 is now $60,000, right Even within that there's There's the question of Uh, will"
"7182570","7184630"," there paint a lot of money for their parts right now?"
"7184850","7186250"," There's shortages and parts right now, right?"
"7187790","7193930"," Um Now if those prices of those serve of those parts go down if they don't have to raise wages"
"7193930","7202990"," for their workers And they can pass along to you that same price Keeping it 60,000 They won't have"
"7202990","7205570"," to reprice the market and tesla stock's gone down."
"7205870","7212770"," So it'll be an implication that tesla stock should soar But if you see like a tesla Uh drop the"
"7212770","7218430"," prices other cars because uh shortages are now and i'm not going away a cost of Materials have gone"
"7218430","7222410"," away Uh, they come back into normal range. "
"7222850","7231950"," Uh, they will they will report price uh tesla more It's a it's not complicated, but it's a um If"
"7231950","7238590"," you see wage price spiral, you'll see the most stock market go up that you should Unless you unless"
"7238590","7247330"," you have unemployment big unemployment because other factors in this too Uh And a real a real true"
"7247330","7250890"," market crash you're going to be looking for high unemployment That's the big one if there was any"
"7250890","7254290"," indicator that was consistently predictive from market crash."
"7254550","7259830"," It's always high employment unemployment That's the only one if you're like the dumb trader."
"7260130","7268670"," You're just looking for high unemployment Um, you don't want to see uh inflation coming down really"
"7268670","7272310"," fast You don't want to see an employment going up really high. "
"7273110","7274350"," I see any of that kind of stuff."
"7274510","7282810"," That's bad Um Yeah, I don't think we're going to get this inflation."
"7284170","7291750"," I don't think uh From my per how I look at it is um If you are if you're a"
"7291750","7297970"," large company that produces like a Cup of the product that everybody consumes regularly That gives"
"7297970","7299350"," price stability, right?"

"8473820","8483820"," absolutely it's It's uh, it's Like everyone's on talking"
"8483820","8489440"," points and talking bites and sound bites and something they read and they can quote Uh, but if you"
"8489440","8493640"," just spend some time reading it into the history of this stuff You can see it historically goes"
"8493640","8500060"," right back to the you know historically goes right back to like cavemen Like if you had If there's"
"8500060","8504740"," like five of us like a group of ten of us that were cavemen and we had fire And you"
"8504740","8510080"," had another group that didn't have fire Right one group's gonna want that fire from you, right?"
"8511100","8516580"," If we both have fire Uh, we're gonna want let's say have group one one small group of cavemen have"
"8516580","8520780"," fire and the other small group of cavemen have fire The two guys that have our two women let's say"
"8520780","8524440"," it's two women with the fire They're gonna go to each other and be like hey look what's we're gonna"
"8524440","8524680"," do."
"8524820","8530780"," I got the fire you get the fire Right And we're gonna help each other to keep down the other"
"8530780","8536520"," the other 10 people that we control so we support each other Right then all of a sudden I got"
"8536520","8537100"," it in my head. "
"8537120","8542880"," I'm like you know what i'm gonna do I'm gonna beat up that other woman with woman with fire and"
"8542880","8544920"," i'm gonna take all of her people does that make sense?"
"8545560","8554220"," And now i'm the only one with fire Or maybe there's two groups with fire right and the other groups"
"8554220","8555220"," fire goes out."
"8555420","8560840"," So they want my fire Right so we got these two groups of 10 people and they both have fire"
"8560840","8565420"," sometimes they have fire sometimes they don't Right and they got a group of people around like 10"
"8565420","8570100"," of them I got like 10 like I got like 10 cavemen around me and i'm the leader because I"
"8570100","8574880"," got the fire Right I got to control the fire and I can't give up that control to anybody And"
"8574880","8580120"," now let's say my buddy down the road's got fire too and then all of a sudden this new Bunch"
"8580120","8583000"," of people come into the area that i'm living in now."
"8583080","8585220"," There's like 30 or 40 people with fire over there. "
"8585400","8585940"," What am I gonna do?"
"8586860","8590660"," I'm gonna take the fire away from all those 30 people over there so that me and my buddy can"
"8590660","8592100"," have control of our fire Does that make sense?"
"8592820","8594540"," Can't have fire all over the place."
"8594900","8600260"," They might be giving the fire to the people that that i'm providing it to Makes sense from very"
"8600260","8606720"," basic level If I if 30 people come into the area living near me and they all have fire They're"
"8606720","8611060"," gonna get into a talking session with the people that don't have fire in my group And they're gonna"
"8611060","8613400"," be like fire Fire is free man."
"8613460","8613800"," It's everywhere. "
"8614640","8618720"," I'm gonna give you some fire You have to listen to that guy anymore with the only guy with fire."
"8618960","8619620"," Does that make sense?"
"8620200","8621180"," So now everybody's got fire."
"8621740","8627100"," Do I have any say over these people up anymore that are helping me Live a better life and you"
"8627100","8627960"," know like you can survive?"
"8628640","8632220"," No Makes sense. "
"8632400","8634460"," That's a simple that's a simple explanation, right?"
"8635800","8646010"," Yeah Yeah, so then the question becomes who's in control who's in charge And"
"8646010","8649790"," when you start to mess with that man, they will do anything to get that away from you And right"
"8649790","8655590"," now you're seeing it the cool part of or the not the cool the fascinating part of it Is satyr"
"8655590","8659330"," said they're all fighting over the digital dollar and i'm like, yes, they are and like they are"
"8661150","8669070"," They all are social media companies are Uh Believe it or not Social media companies want to see the"
"8669070","8674830"," fall of crypto If social media companies want to see the regulation, you don't think that's true,"
"8674830","8684750"," but it is They want to see crypto get regulated i promise you and they want and they"
"8684750","8690870"," want the regulation and they want to control the digital dollar and its access so If you're buying"
"8690870","8697570"," your your stuff off of twitter The Stuff gets kind of mind-blowing you buy your services off"
"8697570","8702530"," twitter you write food off twitter You run your processing through processing credit card"
"8702530","8706830"," processing through twitter then using the digital dollar and twitter Maybe use your twitter account"
"8706830","8713250"," when you go somewhere To buy buy and purchase stuff All these companies want this stuff over time"
"8714570","8718150"," And if all that if all that processing go through them it's huge money."
"8718150","8727840"," It's massive It's control Everybody less fire"
"8731040","8733780"," And so how do you get the government to do that is you have to put the government in your"
"8733780","8734560"," pocket too, right?"
"8734760","8739200"," You need the government to be a partner in this So you see other people fighting and they're"
"8739200","8744100"," they're really fighting amongst each other And then who can win the government to help them, right?"
"8745120","8751360"," So if you were elon mosker if you were um, tim apple or if you were Bill not Bill Gates"
"8751360","8756900"," any longer surge from from um Google like any of these any of these people you'd want to have them"
"8756900","8757520"," with you, right?"
"8758140","8768080"," We get the government involved in this they can help me and I can help them Yeah, it's it's very"
"8768080","8768740"," serious stuff."
"8768880","8775380"," It's very big stuff And so even if they leave crypto and it's formed they want it regulated and"
"8775380","8777060"," rolled into this digital dollar, right?"
"8779900","8787200"," Like it's a very it's a large turning point in society I'm fascinated to find out where it goes Uh,"
"8787480","8793920"," we get a little bit of a dude here we go again man, this is wild You guys want to"
"8793920","8802720"," check on uh You guys want to check on tesla again This is the same shit as yesterday, right?"

"10873100","10878380"," news from the fed and the market just wants a reason to dump down here This is a big-ass"
"10878380","10883640"," trapdoor down here You don't have to trade any of this There's no need for you to trade any of"
"10883640","10888920"," this shit I think if you if you have a hedge on you take profit at some point if you"
"10888920","10893920"," haven't taken profit anywhere in here You're not likely to have a chance to before we get to cpi"
"10894440","10899040"," Somewhere in there you'll probably get some kind of a chance Um, but all that sweet premium that's"
"10899040","10903820"," built built up If you wanted to put on a hedge after the reports, right?"
"10904960","10909380"," Uh, you could wait because they're gonna read because the vol is going to leave the market But"
"10909380","10916500"," you'll see is this you've got event vol right now Like volatility is like really high right now,"
"10916500","10922980"," okay Just event volatility just like Right everybody's scared."
"10923320","10923720"," We're going up. "
"10923840","10924340"," We're going down."
"10924480","10932980"," We're going up going down The moment that we find out which way we're going You're going to see A"
"10932980","10943900"," re-pricing of volatility Even if we go down Um, so you can rebuy a hedge below 390 You"
"10943900","10950040"," can slam the buy button under 390 So you can take the money off the hedge come right back into"
"10950040","10957260"," the market And uh re-hedge again below on the re-pricing of a vol crush because they're not they're"
"10957260","10962400"," gonna expect of the vol What happened is you'll see volatility spread Over a long time period"
"10962400","10970400"," people will start buying like month outputs two month outputs That kind of stuff Remember if"
"10970400","10976040"," there's ever a break below right if we get that that dumping that happens you always want to be"
"10976040","10983460"," looking for the break below The rejection of the move down You never want to see the break below"
"10983460","10985700"," and then we start higher that kind of stuff, right?"
"10985700","10992680"," You want confirmation for each leg down Trade each level If you think we're getting a market crash"
"10993380","11000080"," We'll we'll look right at where the weekly moving average is that kind of stuff Um My thought here"
"11000080","11009980"," is if you want my bias On where the market's going Uh, I'm going to be honest with you"
"11011100","11018200"," Be a hundred percent honest with you, okay I'm gonna hate this, but uh, I do think we're getting a"
"11018200","11026880"," Christmas rally I I'm looking at this from the just the perspective of They're gonna tell you that"
"11026880","11030400"," we're going up Are you gonna hear publicly that we're going up here?"
"11031020","11037160"," I don't know that we actually get up there, but it's a great way for rebalancing It's a great way"
"11037160","11044740"," for them for banks to sell into uh, strength Now will they be done selling into strength here?"
"11045200","11050300"," Maybe in opx they will be I think that's the idea of opening the door up to going down after"
"11050300","11059940"," opx Um, maybe the key here would be if The fed"
"11059940","11067120"," is perceived China says it hopes the united states respects wci panel ruling and corrects it's"
"11067120","11074620"," wrong for conduct As initially of course in relation to section 232 regards to the steel and"
"11074620","11081200"," aluminium tariffs Initially like positive on the market you could see everybody dumped their puts"
"11081200","11089540"," right Market and starts going up And then that's when like I if I had a bunch of money, I"
"11089540","11099600"," would just buy a bunch of cheap ass puts and we'd just roll Just like that It"
"11099600","11105100"," makes sense So that's what I think is going to happen I don't care if we get up here or"
"11105100","11115060"," not That's what I'm looking for Um Now if j-power or if it's not received well"
"11115060","11120260"," by the market Um We can start from running to move down."
"11120420","11124120"," I just don't know how I'm it might take longer than you expect Instead of this kind of like a"
"11124120","11132160"," bloodbath move could take some time Uh into into march you'd actually probably change your price"
"11132160","11137280"," target to march instead of january If you want to see that bloodbath in january, man, you're that's"
"11137280","11142800"," what you're looking for you look at fast move up Then slam it down by january bloodbath If it's"
"11142800","11146560"," somewhere everybody knows the markets going down, it's probably going to take till march I wouldn't"
"11146560","11148320"," shock me to see it take until april. "
"11148420","11157320"," I'll be honest with you Um, so What's my bias my biases that we're going up my bias that our"
"11157320","11164040"," portfolio managers want window dressing Uh, my bias is that they can they can feed everybody they"
"11164040","11170340"," can feed the christmas rally crowd And they can still shitbed the market on the first of the year I"
"11170340","11176440"," think there's plenty of time to do both I think you're making everybody happy to some extent Uh"
"11178360","11180540"," It's easier for you to not trade it though."
"11180580","11186280"," It's always better to be a reaction trader Oh, especially in a like a ball of ants You just sit"
"11186280","11191160"," in the sidelines you close out your your hedges weight on the sidelines You have everything planned"
"11191160","11195960"," out for you're going to do You know that when we do events here, I show you where the top"
"11195960","11201700"," and the bottom is Every time i've done a live stream with you We have tagged the top and the"
"11201700","11208120"," bottom of the of that range usually right almost every time Um or we'll tag the bottom then break"
"11208120","11210500"," through after but you'll have that initial tag, right?"
"11210500","11218620"," Uh, so it gives you the chance to react instead of being in the wrong trade You you could just"
"11218620","11223920"," take a straddle on the market from that top and bottom And trade both sides of it, right?"
"11224300","11230860"," You know that right you can take both both sides of the trade uh the day of The event You"
"11230860","11235860"," take both sides of the trade and you you if you can manage the trades properly or burn one Let"
"11235860","11243160"," the other one ride Eastern time we get us bake a hues total recount prior 784 and us bake a"
"11243160","11251900"," hues oil rig count forecast 629 and the prior 627 No reason not to take a puts a call spread"
"11251900","11256000"," a put spread or something on either side of that trade Put enough time on them."
"11256080","11264380"," They're both probably hit If we go up the call spread's gonna get nailed um I may maybe I would"
"11264380","11269900"," say put a put maybe I would say probably put a zero day calls And then it puts bread or"
"11269900","11270420"," something like that. "
"11270520","11274540"," I'll think about it over the weekend with the best way to start to uh To take the trade for"
"11275240","11285020"," j-pound cpi That's probably going to be zero day calls And a put spread this would be my logic"
"11285020","11295320"," would be If you set up for like a put spread over here Right"
"11295320","11301700"," on a high so if you know, I guess you can put the put spread on Sucks as you want"
"11301700","11311560"," the put spread on after um fucking dividend but You can take a put spread up here And"
"11311560","11318640"," you try to capture something like this from into january and march and you take you would take a"
"11320160","11325940"," You would take some some zero to eight calls And if you get the blast up you made the money"
"11325940","11332360"," on the calls if it rolls over Afterwards, you then you then monetize the put side of that trade"
"11332360","11341140"," something like this Um And if you really blast it off you're more likely gonna come down and retest"
"11341140","11347960"," this level at some point so um Trying to think of all those things and then maybe a market hedge"
"11348500","11356720"," Re-enter market hedge for crash Market edges usually are pretty stable It takes a really big like"
"11356720","11364140"," shift in the market for you to start really bleeding out on those things Uh, well, no two things"
"11365020","11367420"," For the or the event volatility goes away."
"11367760","11373740"," So you definitely so if you don't get the event volatility here To continue like we start bloodbath"
"11373740","11382940"," it down you're going to lose the The premium on that trade so Um I don't know."
"11382980","11391440"," I think that's all I can talk to you guys about that Is it really 7% I'm in a"
