"TPXfc0lJzsg","0","9120"," Good morning traders, this is your daily brief with Captain Jim James, I figured I'd lead"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","9120","14120"," with markets and turmoil, I bet that if you turn on CNBC this morning they're leading"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","14120","18200"," with that with the red screw with the red backer screens."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","18200","22400"," For us we already know that we are at the top of the trading range, we are not long"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","22400","27720"," the market, we are only day trading the day's trends and that we are closing our positions"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","27720","32040"," every day and that we are ready to short."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","32040","36480"," At any time, if you are bleeding this morning in your positions, I recommend that after"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","36480","40880"," this video that you go back and watch all of my previous videos, there are not that many"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","40880","47040"," of them but I did lay out how to be happy this morning and that leads into my next"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","47040","51800"," point which is that you should only be trading with 10 to 30% of your liquidity."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","51800","57240"," I did sleep like a baby last night, I wrapped up my trading yesterday at 12 PM and then"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","57280","62080"," I went out with family and friends, played some tennis, had a barbecue, slept all night"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","62080","63640"," long with no issues."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","63640","69760"," I do not believe the market is signaling a top yet or a major top yet, this is not,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","69760","74200"," this still looks like it's going to be, that it's going to be just a normal correction."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","74200","79520"," The sell-off in after hours was during a low liquidity environment, it was meant to trigger"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","79520","81520"," an event like this."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","81520","88440"," We had one on July 16th where we sold off in after hours and then it continued through"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","88440","96840"," until the 19th and another place to look would be at the 430 mark on the spy."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","96840","103880"," We had a similar pattern begin to form, now that would be if the correction lasts longer"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","103880","109920"," than from let's say today until Monday, if it was to take one to two weeks, then you'd"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","109920","118760"," look back at the 430 on spy for an extended period of correction."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","118760","123360"," But I do expect sideways for a couple of weeks, the market internals are signaling that even"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","123360","130440"," though if today and Monday it looks like the correction will be short-lived."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","130440","136720"," So the tell of course will be where it corrects too, if we do correct all the way down of"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","136720","143200"," course to the low 430s or 428 and that happens fast, then you'll know that the correction"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","143200","145440"," should be over quickly."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","145440","152000"," If we drag it out between now and Monday, then you will see that it should take another"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","152000","156280"," week all next week into the following week."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","156280","160400"," And a few more things, Red Day should make you happy, very happy."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","160400","168040"," It gives you the chance to go along without a lot of stress or worrying about your positions"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","168040","170760"," going red like this morning."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","170760","177120"," I also, I release these videos early morning so that, or because if I release them the"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","177120","181040"," night before they might not be relevant to your upcoming trading day."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","181040","185640"," I hope that you can get these videos in the morning before the day begins and that you"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","185640","189640"," have an accurate picture of what you should be looking for."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","189640","194080"," One other note would be that the market could slow after 11 a.m. today and then Monday is"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","194080","197120"," dangerous for both bulls and bears."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","197120","202720"," We'll get into where the bulls should look for resistance or buy the dip levels for later"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","202720","204680"," on in the video."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","204680","211880"," One last thing you would need to know about would be unknown news, more stimulus forever,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","211880","218440"," evictions are canceled or even J-POW coming out if we dip too deep on Monday, Tuesday"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","218440","219920"," or even two weeks from now."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","219920","222440"," So just be aware of that as well."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","222440","227320"," If anything changes where it does become a black swan event, I will post about it."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","227320","234060"," Although the software that I use is not indicating that at this time, there are new long positions"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","234060","245060"," being started in smaller parts of the SPX and SPY and IWM and some of the smaller cap"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","245060","247180"," tech names."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","247180","253300"," And though there is some risk there because there is some de-risking to bonds, mutual"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","253300","257020"," funds and to precious metals."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","257020","262980"," So you have to take a whole picture and see how much de-risking there is."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","262980","268620"," There is some, but it's not to that black swan event level as of yet."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","268620","276500"," I try to do most of my research for cash market on futures indexes and up here we have the"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","276500","278740"," ES Mini."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","278740","283900"," This gives a better viewpoint as to the pattern that's forming."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","283900","289020"," And if this is a 15 minute delay, but you can see the bounce already taking place here"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","289020","297300"," in pre-market and you'll see that this trend line was respected, that does not mean we"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","297300","302280"," can't break through or that the bears will not attempt to break through this morning"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","302280","311660"," tag somewhere down in here 435.4, 434.17, they would probably take the money and run today."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","311660","317740"," Now if we don't break through these resistance levels today, they will make another attempt"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","317740","324860"," to get down here and that would continue the downward trend leading into somewhere"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","324860","333300"," around August 13th or 12th and possibly as deep into August as the 19th."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","333300","336900"," So you want to be aware of this, you want to be aware of do the bulls take the money"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","336900","343740"," and run or do the bears take the money and run or do we respect this line and bounce"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","343740","346700"," around here over the coming weeks."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","346700","350980"," And then there's always the chance that the bulls would step in and try to push S&P"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","350980","351980"," up."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","351980","356700"," I stopped trading yesterday, right around 12, I checked my profit, I talked on Twitter"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","356700","361900"," about some specific topics I wanted to talk about, but I also posted about spy when we"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","361900","367060"," started shorting this piece of shit and sure enough, if you had started shorting it between"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","367060","372220"," 12 and 2pm, you'd be making some significant money this morning as you wake up."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","372220","377060"," Daily Briefs, they're usually 3 to 4 to 5 parts."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","377060","380820"," You can come into these on Twitter and you can snap your own lines for the day, typically"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","380820","388820"," they'll say if you look at the spy here, I changed this from expected daily range to"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","388820","391660"," expected daily resistance."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","391660","397340"," I'm looking to short these numbers here, but to say if we were to get to 440 today, I'm"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","397340","403500"," going to look to short this this morning, same with 438, 437, until we get a nice, until"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","403500","404660"," we hit some targets."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","404660","411940"," The first one would definitely be 435, 25, and then possibly 433, 29, Monday open targets"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","411940","413260"," 428, 44."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","413260","416500"," This is what the bears are targeting, do we go that low?"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","416500","422340"," I don't know, but I know for sure that these are some targets that they're aiming for today"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","422340","423340"," into Monday."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","423340","429180"," The bears will also use some specific economic news today, so their advantage, they're looking"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","429180","434380"," at personal income and also consumer spending at the 830 hour, they're going to try to use"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","434380","440380"," those for volatility and for deflation fairs, you'll see inflation fairs be stoked in news"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","440380","448020"," articles this morning, and then you also have Chicago PMI at 945."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","448020","452140"," Moving over to the charts, let's look at the spy real quick."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","452140","460540"," You can see that I drew that same emerging pattern in here, it was starting to play itself"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","460540","465920"," out before yesterday, but I didn't really talk about it because I wanted to see some"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","465920","472740"," kind of confirmation, you can see yesterday we had this S2 and this R2 or S1 and R2 level,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","472740","478140"," so if you missed this short here, you're going to look for some type of relief up to this"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","478140","486420"," 440.56 or 438.76 today, if any of these are met, I will short this down, the bears are"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","486420","495100"," attempting to tag 435.25 and possibly 433.29, in a dream world, they're going to want to"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","495100","505580"," hit down here on Monday, this is the 428-44 level, if you see a bid catch this today,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","505580","512540"," I would say I would highly doubt that it takes root, it's possible if we tag here 435 that we"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","512540","518940"," could catch the bid up on Monday or just some more continuation down on Monday. The key thing"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","518940","526700"," that you need to know about today and tomorrow is that the easiest play is down, and what I want"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","526700","533340"," you to know about that is retail didn't short this, banks did, and when banks short this, they"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","533340","540860"," wanted to go down. Be conscious of that today as you trade. If I had to rate the three indexes on"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","540860","547020"," the best opportunity to short, I would go first, I would short the NASDAQ, then I would short the"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","547020","555020"," spy, and then I would short IWM. If you wanted your chances of having it stick and making the most"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","555020","561740"," money going short. Moving on, we're going to go to get into NDX or the NASDAQ. In yesterday's video,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","561820","568460"," we talked about the weakness in NASDAQ, big tech, has had most of their earnings. Some of the mid"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","568460","574140"," caps have been laggards, some of the small caps as well, although I expect some of them to also"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","574140","581260"," pick up a bid for IWM into the coming weeks. I think that we do look for hard resistance at"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","581260","591020"," $14,959, and a continued downtrend look seeking out $14,901, $14,844 for the Monday"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","591020","599420"," target of $14,793. Somewhere down here, I am looking for this to take place between now and on Monday."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","600220","606700"," Let's put that, I just already put my bar in for Friday, and we'll put our Monday tag in."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","607660","613500"," So, I am looking for this to come down and test this major support here at $4.98."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","614380","620140"," I do think that it will attempt to bounce back up here, but the key with NASDAQ is"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","621260","626780"," there are certain levels that it's not coming back to. So, if there are any rips today in NASDAQ,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","628060","635180"," I would take a debit put spread on the queues, and you could probably put them in the money and date"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","635260","643500"," them for around the third or fourth. I haven't taken a look yet, but the key to take away from"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","643500","650940"," this on NASDAQ is that I do expect it to trade under $14,800 for some time. Next index that I"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","650940","660700"," want you to see is IWM. The bears will attempt to test some major support in the coming days."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","661260","665500"," The one thing that you should know is that even with the de-risking in the market,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","665500","671500"," there has been some risk on and small caps. We are still in earning season for small and mid caps."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","673340","681180"," I do expect IWM to consolidate between $2.20 and $2.18.25. Somewhere in this range here,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","681180","689180"," over the coming days, you will see tests as low below $2.18.25 with a small possibility of a"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","689180","697420"," buy the dip situation at $2.12.07 and $2.09.39. So, you are looking for some sort of buy the"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","697420","703340"," dip situation, no matter what, buy the dip situation down here and here. There's also this small"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","703340","712460"," little support zone right here, $2.15.68. If we were down here for just the briefest of moments,"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","712460","718220"," I'd probably buy that as well. It would have to be a black swan event for me to not be buying"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","718220","725340"," the dips in IWM. Please like and subscribe. I really do want other traders to find that these"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","725340","732780"," videos so that they can have a chance to follow along and make money. I do really do appreciate the"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","732780","737340"," support that you've all been showing me and let me know in the comments if you want me to do a"
"TPXfc0lJzsg","737340","742540"," live stream on Saturday mornings or Sunday mornings. I could chart your favorite tickers."
"TPXfc0lJzsg","742540","748060"," Another than that, I'll see you guys on Twitter today. Have a great day."
