"225420","232160"," You do something Okay, close that up Now we're gonna take a look at the market real quick and then"
"232160","239460"," we're gonna talk about what to be expecting after the move yesterday And we have some interesting"
"239460","245760"," stuff going on the background So we were we said that this week we would be looking for if we're"
"245760","252520"," going to be in consolidation or distribution If we'd say see major low price or low enough prices"
"252520","259100"," that Consolidation would turn into distribution Or if we would trade sideways and not get very low"
"259100","265920"," prices While we're in consolidation and certainly now I expect us to trade just you guys have a"
"265920","271420"," heads up I do expect us to trade sideways and Have some kind of a relief rally here at some"
"271420","281740"," point, but even with that said Let me mute Book map real quick Even with that said We"
"281740","287500"," definitely have a directional change Which is positive for knowing where we're going or we go like"
"287500","292200"," we the question was this week Are we going up or we're gonna trade sideways and make a break higher"
"292200","294020"," or are we going to make a break lower?"
"294700","300640"," Are we going to 420 we're going to 406 so we're going to go to 320 which way which where"
"300640","306320"," we go and we need to find out which where we're going and this seems This at the moment seems"
"307080","309320"," Definitively that we're going much lower now."
"309460","311100"," We're not going to get up to that 406."
"311640","317300"," We got pretty close I think on SPX got to 401 But definitively it looks like we've made a decision"
"317300","318460"," that we're going to head lower. "
"318940","327020"," So quickly we'll look at And the funny part was it was the overnight last night and this morning"
"327020","331120"," which unlocked that door to Look to lower prices."
"331760","337760"," So we're gonna take a look at that and We had these sellers come in past this past week here"
"337760","345780"," We had buyers step up in the last four or five trading sessions and you can see Rather than rather"
"345780","347960"," than finding some balance here, right?"
"348360","355420"," We broke below Right here and bears are now wanting to defend this right and there's a reason for"
"355420","360780"," this Even if we get this train so in this break right here was one of the keys I'll show"
"360780","365300"," this on a daily so you can see it later on, but Any kind of any kind of rip in"
"365300","367400"," here should be sold at this point."
"367560","373840"," Okay, and the key part about this is The best way to describe this would be I'm just gonna bring"
"373840","374420"," this better here. "
"375160","385420"," So What you're looking for here right is acceptance at these levels Right"
"385420","390360"," so we can trade up here get told no cup here We get accepted into these levels and the question"
"390360","391200"," becomes yesterday."
"391520","392780"," Can we get above right?"
"393160","397480"," So right at the belly yesterday we knew that we had we knew that we had a moving average coming"
"397480","402040"," in and a moving average coming up here And we were told hell no, you're not going up there"
"402040","402980"," yesterday, right?"
"403980","412320"," And so when that happens and you get rejected above like this We start to look lower Right we"
"412320","418260"," started looking lower here And the truth is right the truth is that if you look back here, right?"
"418460","418940"," We looked lower."
"419860","426040"," We were told no Right so we came back up for one more check up here, and we made this"
"426040","427940"," lower high over here That's it. "
"428140","433080"," That's a second time of being told no so when you get told no like this It really does become"
"433080","439960"," a matter of this level is now this this level down here is now not valid Okay, because we went"
"439960","443120"," up there twice and checked to see they can make this up."
"443280","451160"," It's not a larger chart That's even better over there The camp here right found some acceptance"
"451160","457480"," attempted to make that that trade higher for for the next level higher We're told no came back down"
"457480","457760"," here."
"457820","463740"," We're told one more try right camp here Rejected again when you get rejected like this the second"
"463740","466840"," time told no told no, right?"
"467000","468420"," We already checked this level down below. "
"468820","472800"," We're now going to hit We're now going to head down ultimately head down to this lower level down"
"472800","479520"," here And you're gonna we're gonna recheck these lows that we had back here So we got 348 we have"
"479520","487120"," 365 to 360 down here some more than likely there's a high probability at this point That you will"
"487120","493600"," get some kind of a recheck down below and We're more than let and bears are going to want to"
"493600","500980"," turn this into resistance here once we check below and We'll trade higher and then continue down"
"500980","507440"," lower and I'm gonna explain why we're gonna go lower down here in a moment I'm gonna show you One"
"507440","513059"," of the one of the keys that you were looking for yesterday and even this morning Okay, and that's"
"513059","520840"," gonna be in XL you and XLP When we were selling off yesterday, there were two places you did not"
"520840","527760"," want to see sell off and the depth that they sold off The first one would be XL you And"
"527760","532120"," so when you look let me bring up XL you in a daily chart here Now I want you to"
"532120","540560"," see this here with XL you If we were selling off yesterday and you saw market participants"
"540560","547940"," specifically portfolio managers hiding in here Right you would you would want to have seen XL you"
"547940","556020"," kind of hold up It's kind of weird too because XL re held up in the overnight and XL Me'll"
"556020","558900"," bring this up on another chart here It was really bizarre."
"559160","566080"," There's some really bizarre moves yesterday and some some really bizarre places that Held up in"
"566080","567180"," yesterday's sell-up."
"567400","573120"," I guess there could be some argument made that That that where portfolio managers hit yesterday. "
"573120","579320"," I'll show you guys where they're hiding But I did find it kind of odd This would be maybe Let"
"579320","580620"," me see me and delete all this here."
"580880","590660"," Let me clear clear some of this stuff out here move indicators and Just a"
"590660","597400"," second here If you're just joining us try to go back to the beginning of the broadcast Speed up"
"597400","601740"," your players so that you can catch up with us in real time So you're not you're not asking"
"601740","608400"," questions as the morning progresses here So this kind of interesting right we're gonna take a look"
"608400","616720"," this morning and I want you to see here Down this bottom right hand side We got the consumer"
"616720","617640"," staples sold."
"617960","620600"," That's a big no-no right utilities sold. "
"620800","623560"," That's a big no-no This is where portfolio managers were hiding."
"624080","630880"," It was really fascinating though That we had a real real estate was at a hundred percent As of"
"630880","636700"," yesterday, even though it took a hit I was kind of surprised and you see energy Get catching a bit"
"636700","644740"," as well, and then we've got Go on here Communications still has a bit knit over here, and I was"
"644740","650300"," interested to see what finance was doing decent bid in it yesterday But I don't like to see"
"651860","657240"," Utilities catch that that hit that it took yesterday some some people out there would say well"
"657240","662360"," That's that's showing that we're putting risk on to the market Even though we sold here cap, and"
"662360","668980"," I'm saying if you look if you look at XL you We're gonna look at XL you right now, right"
"670760","677700"," This is a daily chart XL you and you see this little green line right here If we break below"
"677700","682240"," this little green line right here, this is the 176 but you could make it a 200 it really doesn't"
"682240","694000"," matter We'll make it a we'll make it a 200 just for shits and giggles Now"
"694000","699620"," I want you to see this okay, there's a big reason for this You see when we break below the"
"699620","700080"," screen line."
"700180","707180"," It's usually leads to some major major down moves in the market This is very unhealthy when you see"
"707180","711040"," this move right here You can see that there's some real danger in the market. "
"711220","716760"," We have another huge low in March of 2021 You can see what happened in March of or excuse me"
"716760","722920"," in a January of 2020 Even though we had a reaction trade here We broke right below that green line"
"722920","730520"," again and just historically when you see that break in XL you It's usually a sign of danger In the"
"730520","735500"," market it can also be a sign of risk on in the market as well when XL you kind of"
"735500","741720"," bleeds out But just right now if you're looking at this break of of this big 200 day moving average"
"741720","748560"," right here very dangerous seeing this Very very dangerous for the market to see this We've seen the"
"748560","754720"," end of a of a down cycle as well Come down here trade back up right lead down and then"
"754720","758380"," we have this explosive move higher Now so the community argument made that we'll have this"
"758380","762820"," explosive move higher again But in all honesty if you if I see if I see that if I see"
"762820","770920"," XL you this week it gives me pause Pause in the market to say We not only not only might"
"770920","775940"," might we get lower prices here with this real risk of Much lower lows."
"776200","781100"," So if I didn't see that today if I didn't see that today, I might be saying to myself Yeah,"
"781140","788380"," you know, maybe we only trade down maybe we only trade down here like 350 360 some here test these"
"788380","795040"," lows We're good to go but in all honesty seeing that XL you that that week right now I'm gonna"
"795040","801840"," go with the JPM caller right now posted that JPM caller for you guys many times and So I'm gonna"
"801840","804560"," be expecting And this isn't today."
"804680","810060"," I wouldn't be like super bearish to be looking for repositioning Some kind of repositioning here"
"810660","811380"," Come on here. "
"811660","816520"," It's that blue line right there some kind of repositioning for this next leg And then we'll we'll"
"816520","821920"," look for something much lower down over here And that's what proven look wrong at any point if we"
"821920","823000"," don't get a rejection here."
"823060","831580"," We'll look at this if this So the first leg for bears completed The second leg for bears is going"
"831580","840520"," to be having a rejection at some point 392 even a failure to close the gap up above at 391"
"840520","845780"," 392 if they start heading lower here That's the final key."
"845980","853980"," That's the key for bears for this big huge trade down below Uh to 360 345 somewhere in there So"
"853980","860020"," i'll be looking to put on a market hedge at some point today tomorrow Even in monday into monday"
"860020","864020"," and see if we can get this big leg down here because this is a juicy This is a juicy"
"864020","872740"," move down here below so give me a second here get uh Back to the one minute here Scroll this"
"872740","883350"," in for you So intraday in today tomorrow friday Not"
"883350","889530"," not bearish at this point on the intraday Uh, but i am looking for a failure above at some point"
"889530","897370"," and we'll look at uh to get this Get rid of some of this stuff for you I'm going to"
"897370","902070"," expect those rips to be sold or below pivot up here to any kind of trade higher here Click trying"
"902070","906430"," to close the gap of 390 Uh failure at 394 something like that. "
"906650","911730"," As a matter of fact, i'll put some uh Let me go to a five in here We're going to"
"911730","922130"," look for a couple places to grab a short on I"
"922130","923750"," can make that one yellow right there."
"924550","925810"," That's a five minute chart."
"926050","940380"," We're going to get a 15 minute Somewhere in here We'll"
"940380","941340"," put this one right here. "
"941460","950220"," This is the place where bears want to This is the place where bears want to hold this I guess"
"950220","952780"," there could be one more box drawn in here."
"953040","959200"," I've been in a higher time frame somewhere right in here Uh, bears want to hold all of this right"
"959200","965400"," here And this would give the confirmation some kind of rejection here If the bears can get this"
"965400","969720"," nice beautiful rejection right in here Some kind of a failure at some point in here."
"969720","972340"," I don't care if it's now I don't care if it's on friday. "
"972440","976340"," I don't care if it's on monday Uh, but the bears can get this kind of rejection."
"976740","984960"," We're going to be seeing Uh At least 360 on the lower end probably 345ish Um, I'm making a"
"984960","990620"," capitulation moment down below This is excellent work by the bears This break and as a matter of"
"990620","996020"," fact the first of this first leg of this first leg right here uh, one of the key breaks was"
"996500","998760"," Uh losing this this level right here."
"998800","1002900"," The second key break Uh was this level right in here. "
"1003180","1003600"," Now."
"1003680","1009160"," It was that 390 right in here was the next key break for bears Uh, so good job first leg"
"1009160","1012460"," complete Uh door open to down below at this point."
"1012740","1017140"," Now the last the only last key would be some kind of rejection right here And this would this"
"1017140","1023819"," definitely opens the door to 360 and then the the way the way some of the way that Parts of"
"1023819","1030760"," the or sub sectors of the sb 500 Uh sold yesterday is ultra bearish at this point in my view"
"1030760","1037020"," ultra bearish when I don't like seeing xlu dump as much as it did um And it does lend some"
"1037579","1044260"," Possible, yeah, I heard something yesterday about possible front running of um of a pause and this"
"1044260","1049480"," could be the start of it If there if somebody knows some kind of information and within the"
"1049480","1054060"," government that says yeah, they're going to pause rates Not in the fall or winter, but they're"
"1054060","1058180"," going to do them sooner than you think They'll more than likely front run a pause and if they do"
"1058180","1064120"," front run a pause you're going to see You should see a capitulation moment in the market heading"
"1064120","1070800"," into springtime So we're looking for that into Uh the next few days to uh to grab a market short"
"1071980","1075560"," Uh and what would and if you I guess if you question what the question would be what would"
"1075560","1081180"," invalidate date that if you're a bull And you want some uh that to be invalidated you're going to"
"1081180","1088240"," be looking for here I'm going to delete this, but if you're a bull if you want to see Uh"
"1088840","1095200"," The bearish case become invalidated you're going to be looking for Uh this true range right here to"
"1095200","1102900"," be recovered Uh, you guess you could call the true range like right here You'd want to see you'd"
"1102900","1112260"," want to see this zone Uh not you'd want to see one here Now some still open shows the bears"
"1112260","1117620"," need this rejection here There is no doubt that bears are going to need a rejection here And this"
"1117620","1123000"," this invalidate all of this Now if uh that the bulls will say oh, well cap. "
"1123200","1127340"," I'm still super bullish here Um Things haven't changed yet."
"1127400","1129340"," This is my last hope cap."
"1129560","1137400"," Give me some hope Uh, you would want to see uh a recovery back into Um Into this consolidation here"
"1137400","1142680"," and then you'd want to see some work done into next week something like that This is what though. "
"1142900","1149980"," This is what a bull would want to see Uh to to not invalidate this whole entire Uh balance above"
"1149980","1150300"," here."
"1150460","1157240"," So that's your only hope is a bull Now but more than likely the the probability you have bulls had"
"1157240","1162920"," probability up here to at least test these highs Once we break down the the depth of breaking down"
"1162920","1169080"," that we did Uh, the ball is certainly certainly in the bears court at this point So i'm going to"
"1169080","1173880"," read your uh read your chats or the chat messages right now and uh see what you guys have to"
"1173880","1180720"," say And uh, yeah, i'm going to delete this right here because the the bulls are definitely not in"
"1180720","1189550"," charge right now Let me just say here But you guys can't see all that shit."
"1189590","1197930"," We got the frickin book map back up So if you're a bull So if you're a bull right Uh,"
"1198050","1202230"," what i was trying to say to you earlier is you got this range right here, right It's kind of"
"1202230","1210360"," like your true range right here Uh bulls if you have your last hope you would need to recover Uh"
"1210360","1218400"," recover back up in here And uh and get some get some more consolidation going in here, but the"
"1218400","1226960"," truth is Uh this move this move last line of this bell coming down Uh did structural damage for the"
"1226960","1227160"," bulls. "
"1227260","1231580"," So we're going to delete this i'm not going to leave this up for you Uh, so how long here"
"1232100","1238180"," Um, so when we were up here Bulls had the chance to test those highs and they took that chance"
"1238180","1247220"," once Twice three times and they were told hell no above Uh, so i'm going to we're going to get"
"1247220","1248180"," rid of that green box."
"1248380","1252760"," That's your last 10% chance and time is running out for bulls."
"1253020","1260260"," You gotta remember if you're a bull there right today is the 19th you've got What is it eight days"
"1260260","1266440"," or not not even that many sessions Uh until end of month you've got Uh, what do we got here?"
"1266920","1275300"," one two three four five six seven eight You've got eight nine sessions. "
"1275740","1277000"," I guess that could be done."
"1277020","1285040"," You got nine sessions to close above 400 you need that Forget 390 you need 400 Into first of year"

"3152880","3159500"," Um, yeah, there's if historically in the u.s stock market Uh, there's a few things that happen."
"3159600","3165120"," Okay, uh, so when the Now the fed or the fed doesn't really stop inflation."
"3165820","3175180"," They basically Try to buy time for inflation to go down and for inflation to be accepted Now As the"
"3175180","3182860"," fed's real true job is to make you believe Right that they're cutting and that that impacts"
"3182860","3188700"," inflation believe it or not Now when they when they announced when they made that announcement in"
"3188700","3192620"," 2022 We we we blasted down into may. "
"3192760","3202580"," Okay Over time we consolidated over the seven months of 2022 we consolidated and the fed"
"3202580","3206460"," continued To press and say we're fighting inflation."
"3207060","3212040"," We're not going to cut rates We're in this for the long haul as time progresses right when that"
"3212040","3221260"," happens Historically Our market tends to bottom Trade sideways and slightly up Until They actually"
"3221260","3228720"," cut rates Now whenever they they choose to do that, right Typically it means that something is"
"3228720","3230440"," broken in the system."
"3230620","3235680"," They've broken something in the system They found out that they've broken something and they're"
"3235680","3240920"," looking for and there's a few key things they've broken They've broken either an institution"
"3242480","3250820"," They've broken the back of workers that would be a high unemployment rate Or they've broken"
"3250820","3257360"," something in the treasury department swaps could be swaps could be overnight currencies could be a"
"3257360","3265300"," number of things right someone didn't show up to a bond auction uh, any of those things And so what"
"3265300","3270320"," they'll do is they'll start beginning to cut rates Uh, and we'll have this last capitulation moment"
"3270320","3277720"," that that'll clean out the market Uh, and so historically you'll see this Uh, like you i've shown"
"3277720","3283160"," it on the program in the past Um, this goes back this goes back to the entirety of the of"
"3283160","3289320"," the us stock market Uh, so you'll possibly see that and that possibly there's a high percentage"
"3289320","3298760"," chance that you're going to see that Uh, like like 99 not 99 like a 75 to 80 percent chance"
"3298760","3303920"," that at some point Uh, you'll see that last capitulation now price doesn't matter in that"
"3303920","3311640"," capitulation Uh, so we let's say we traded to 460 And then we had the capitulation and we traded to"
"3311640","3317540"," 420 and had the capitulation Uh, the banks and the fed would like to see that's the soft landing"
"3317540","3323280"," They'd like to see you know, this thousand point bloodbath, but we only go down to 3000 We only go"
"3323280","3331340"," down to um 3200 something like that Now you've got uber bears that are like Well, hopefully we get"
"3331340","3338860"," that last capitulation And it breaks a bank or breaks an institution and then we plunge even deeper"
"3339640","3348240"," Down to 2400 or 1400 Right, um, so so so they're looking for that in that capitulation move"
"3348240","3355640"," whenever that is Um, so price doesn't really matter here Uh, and You know bears want to see us"
"3355640","3362400"," trade to 3450 and then have the capitulation Right so they can get that 2400 And they've been"
"3362400","3368520"," robbed of that in 2022 Uh, so price I wouldn't worry about price as much I'd be more worried about"
"3368520","3375960"," when it happens Uh, not the price that we're at often you know, if you look at 2022 Whenever we"
"3375960","3383260"," trade it down to steep lows That's when you heard the largest cacophony of Let's have that last uh"
"3383260","3390580"," bloodletting like let's go from 34 And drop another 800 points Uh, it doesn't normally and"
"3390580","3398020"," sometimes it does, uh, I guess 07 and 08 it did 2000 it did But that's not the norm Uh,"
"3398220","3404660"," and as a matter of fact if you go back to both the dot com crash and the gfc Weeks"

"4004920","4011560"," I think no I read a white paper once That was put out about the how puts are not structured"
"4011560","4019920"," for you To trade them like a call They're not built like that And so if you own the underlying"
"4019920","4028080"," And you want to buy insurance inputs like some really cheap puts on your underlying holding You're"
"4028080","4034860"," going to hold them until they expire worthless or print heavy and hard As insurance on your equity"

"4360940","4364720"," in something like that Uh, but something that appreciates over time. "
"4364980","4370380"," It could be uh, I bought some commercial real estate property and i'm renting it out to Uh the"
"4370380","4377120"," local laundromat or something or I bought a I bought a uh storage company Um, I don't know."

"4381840","4391580"," appreciates Or maybe uh, you know, you know, you get the gist right and the reason is that when we"
"4391580","4396180"," go into a bear market Uh, a few things happen, right?"
"4396640","4402540"," They start to liquidate uh, just distribute Uh shares of the positions you were in so they take"
"4402540","4403520"," money from there, right?"
"4404060","4406820"," Uh, the value of your holdings go goes down."
"4407000","4413420"," They depreciate Uh, but the most fascinating part anyone that was able to pull money out of the"
"4413420","4419820"," market In the past couple of years three years it started in uh 2020 and the end of 2020 And"
"4419820","4427440"," then it and then we had a silent bear market in spec growth in 2021 and then in 2022 Uh,"
"4427800","4433840"," we started to go after uh, fairly good blue chip stocks unless unless they were wrapped up with the"
"4433840","4439720"," corporate debt bonds Um from the treasury department like apple and companies like that And then"
"4439720","4440920"," they left the kind of left alone. "
"4441040","4446400"," Uh, the indexes and they left alone Uh, the fang man type stocks and the blue chips that were"
"4446400","4452780"," wrapped up with the fed Uh, but then you know, let's say you took your money out of the market"
"4452780","4453840"," in that time period, right?"
"4454080","4462180"," And you started to buy appreciating assets This past uh year 2022 specifically and leading into the"
"4462180","4464700"," end of 2022 And let's say you bought some depreciating assets."
"4465120","4472620"," Let's say you did go by the 140,000, uh pickup truck right What people that people that took that"
"4472620","4479920"," money out are now seeing is in this even myself Uh that the government not only the government the"
"4479920","4485360"," fed Incorporations it starts with corporations and it moves to the federal government But"
"4485360","4489660"," corporations know what when what's coming Uh, so you see higher prices, right?"
"4489800","4493900"," You see higher prices when you're buying food You'll see higher prices when your inflation kicks"
"4493900","4494420"," up, right?"
"4495140","4497960"," And they're trying to get that they can't get the money out of the market So they're gonna get that"
"4497960","4499960"," mark that money from you Right?"
"4500320","4502580"," So you've got corporations and you've got wealthy individuals."
"4502980","4505600"," They're like, well, I'm not getting money from the fed Not getting money from the federal"
"4505600","4506020"," government. "
"4506120","4512120"," I'm not getting money from uh, the senate I'm not getting money from the stock market now So i'm"
"4512120","4518380"," going to bleed these people like me and you Of their money and then the federal government kicks it"
"4518380","4521420"," steps in and they're like, well, we're going to start taxing So we're going to tax all these"
"4521420","4522720"," properties, right?"
"4522860","4526720"," And you've got workers that are now being Squeezed so they start to want money."
"4527100","4528280"," So someone's going to come paint my house."
"4528440","4530940"," They're going to charge me Double but you know a higher percentage. "
"4531340","4535760"," So me personally I take the money out of the stock market I got uh someone that's like nope."
"4535920","4537020"," You're going to pay more for lumber."
"4537220","4537300"," Nope. "
"4537500","4541840"," You're going to pay more to have your Your leaky pipe fixed And mechanics like we have to charge"
"4541840","4547440"," more Parts or more and the federal government your county government your state government Come in"
"4547440","4548940"," and they're like, well, we're going to raise your taxes."
"4549160","4552960"," We're going to raise your millage on the roads We're going to pitch it the gas pump all these"
"4552960","4557880"," things right and eventually it rolls into Uh, where the fed government federal government comes in"
"4557880","4564720"," and starts to want to squeeze uh Corporations and squeeze wealthy individuals And try to remove"
"4564720","4566040"," this money from the system."
"4566480","4572540"," So it's your job as my my ultimate point here is It's your job to try to not just take"
"4572540","4578080"," the money out of the stock market But then protect that money Uh from from it being ripped out of"
"4578080","4583820"," your hands even if it's not in the stock market And that is not an easy goal to accomplish Because"
"4583820","4589940"," with the with the federal government's ultimately trying to do is say we gave you free money here"
"4589940","4597640"," jim here's a hundred dollars And play with it For the next decade or two I'm like a 25 year"
"4597640","4602600"," old guy and they're like here's a hundred dollars And I want you to play with it for the next"
"4602600","4606900"," decade or two And so I take the hundred dollars and I'm like, I got a decade or two and"
"4606900","4612440"," I'm like, okay Do I take that hundred dollars and try to build something that appreciates or buy"
"4612440","4616820"," something that appreciates Where am I going to buy that lambo over there?"
"4618580","4620820"," And so you have to make that decision, right?"
"4622060","4628620"," And so for the next two decades captain jim sits over here and I either have to um Either buy"
"4628620","4634980"," the lambo and I just start partying And then when that when we do a tightening cycle They take my"
"4634980","4639480"," lambo away from me, right and because I just fucking burned it Right to get fucked right?"
"4639700","4645780"," I can't buy another lambo can't get lambo fixed anymore And so eventually my lambo breaks down and"
"4645780","4649820"," I'm removed from uh, uh, I didn't do a good job, right?"
"4649820","4656560"," I declare bankruptcy and then I go rent a house somewhere or apartment somewhere Now there's"
"4656560","4661100"," another captain jim out there in another universe and he was like, I got a hundred bucks So he's"
"4661100","4661860"," like, what am I gonna do?"
"4663140","4668160"," So I take the hundred dollars and I put it into a business And I go, you know what?"
"4668300","4676280"," I'm gonna take the hundred dollars when I build myself, um I'm gonna build myself Uh, uh, fart"
"4676280","4682160"," cushion I'm gonna make fart cushions Like the you know the joke fart cushions somebody got like a"
"4682160","4691620"," fart cushion And I choose a horrible company to make my fart cushions They they like break"
"4691620","4696760"," you get like four or five uses out of them And initially I'm making money and I'm pumping out money"
"4696760","4702040"," and I'm making my i'm doing really good to buy that lambo Uh, get some more free money from the"
"4702040","4707520"," government doing great But then the market titans and people realize that my fart cushion sucks So,"
"4708120","4712280"," uh, and I don't I don't make any I don't make a uh, a pillow version of my fart cushion"
"4712280","4715220"," I don't do any expansion growth or anything like that, right?"
"4715820","4720380"," And so I think i'm doing great when the tightening cycle comes and not as many people want my"
"4720380","4723580"," product anymore I get clipped Does it make sense?"
"4724360","4731280"," And then there's another dimension The multiverse where the captain jim goes I'm gonna make a fart"
"4731280","4737400"," cushion, but i'm gonna make it so it lasts And i'm also going to invest in a fart pillow in"
"4737400","4739700"," a fart blanket People want that shit. "
"4740020","4744600"," They want a fart watch to put on their hands And they're gonna implicate it or they're gonna they"
"4744600","4745560"," need this in their life."
"4745780","4750520"," They need to use it every day And i'm gonna do all that hard work for this and we're not"
"4750520","4755040"," gonna take profit We're just gonna keep reinvesting it reinvesting and reinvesting it There's a lot"
"4755040","4755980"," of version of captain jim."
"4756200","4760800"," He like he like built and built and built and built did take a dollar back So turn that hundred"
"4760800","4766880"," it's 200 then 300 and 400 and he made sure that that company was was working its ass off So"
"4766880","4771360"," we get some tightening cycle comes into play and then and I lose some of that some I lose I"
"4771360","4778180"," go from 500 Down to 400 then down to 300 then down to 200 dollars And the tightening cycle stops"
"4778180","4786460"," and i'm kind of barely hanging on And i'm like whoa I just i'm like, oh where's someone now is"
"4786460","4791900"," back to the fart cushion, but it's a good one We stopped development of the of the fart tires for"
"4791900","4793360"," people's vehicles and stuff. "
"4793460","4798460"," That was a crazy idea We have much extra money flowing around But at least that fart cushions keep"
"4798460","4799880"," me here Right."
"4800260","4801880"," So that version of captain jim james."
"4802080","4805720"," He survived He Was given a hundred bucks. "
"4806380","4810540"," He wound up at the end with only 200 But hey, it's a hundred percent profit right and that"
"4810540","4815700"," tightening cycle and now he started a brand new cycle And i'm left standing i'm an old guy i'm now"
"4815700","4819700"," like 40 50 years old We start this new debt cycle and i'm like, sweet they're gonna give me some"
"4819700","4826380"," more free money So you get another hundred bucks from the government and meanwhile All those people"
"4826380","4832360"," with bad debt Got we'll get washed out and washed away All those people that fucked up they do the"
"4832360","4839780"," wrong thing they got washed away And our capital system Is built like this so that we can then take"
"4839780","4844400"," a new generation of young people and i'm standing there in the old guy over there in the corner And"
"4844400","4850220"," some young guy comes up or if some young woman comes up and she's like They just gave me a"
"4850220","4850580"," hundred bucks."

"4869360","4873500"," not gonna build a baseball bat I'm gonna build a better far cushion than that than that old guy"
"4873500","4874300"," over there, right?"
"4874780","4880160"," So you're allowing this next young generation To step and then make it washed out in that second"
"4880160","4887640"," that second cycle, but it allows this next generation to have an opportunity um To build something"
"4887640","4890820"," now whether you agree or disagree with this system. "
"4890900","4898360"," That's what this system is And that's what the capital system is in our country Um, so you want to"
"4898360","4905640"," see that play itself out and we haven't seen that play itself out yet in this cycle Uh, so you"

"6705870","6707350"," There's another one coming down here."
"6707350","6711590"," I think it was right here Uh, we were they gonna or we know we're going to get a rejection"
"6711590","6716770"," But you you would look you would look for the rebuy and there was no rebuy We ended up slipping"
"6716770","6719870"," underneath the hourly Uh at this point yesterday. "
"6720230","6725370"," We broke underneath the hourly So the onus right here if you're a tesla guy tesla girl, whatever"
"6725370","6734470"," tesla they tesla them You have some key levels here that you need to be writing down So and i'm"
"6734470","6744410"," gonna give them to you right here like if you're a bear You want to hold"
"6745410","6755270"," Bears want to hold Now in 127 73 we're going to look somewhere else to"
"6755270","6765110"," 127 73 You know bears want to be holding this and I think this"
"6765110","6770030"," this is um, I think this white line right here Uh that we were showing this is kind of like"
"6770030","6771530"," negative and positive gamma."
"6771830","6776450"," I believe i'll have to go back and look but Yeah, that was our one above."
"6776770","6777790"," This is s1 down here. "
"6777910","6783950"," We broke in support here That's a very key level here for bears to hold on to Uh they want"
"6783950","6791690"," to hold this right here have to hold this If they do hold that for that for that hourly trend"
"6791690","6797970"," down we reject here, it's going to get nasty Uh, so if you're a bull watch in this program, you"
"6797970","6803710"," need to regain this like this you need to regain 127 you need to regain 128 Uh 45 we'll look"
"6803710","6818580"," at a daily chart too And look closer And you have"
"6818580","6819500"," more work to do too."
"6819680","6828700"," You see that they pinned right out teed right off it bam Ultra bearish right now on on that"
"6828700","6841080"," rejection ultra all I can't can't tell you how bearish I am We're"
"6841080","6846040"," talking about material trend change And you see the squeeze here."
"6846160","6851160"," There's a giant squeeze here There's there's a giant squeeze that can take place I mean you should"
"6851160","6855860"," be aware of that too if we're able to get above on the daily There's a monster squeeze here. "
"6855960","6864320"," The problem is though You know, we have monster moves down ahead for us There'll be a velocity"
"6865560","6871660"," Slowing a velocity in here where we're not going to probably get down below 95 Or 60 bucks and you"
"6871660","6872980"," can see here too."
"6873280","6880580"," I mean bulls have something working for them That is capitulation here by retail and the buying by"
"6880580","6890340"," banks here Uh, so the truth is in the real truth is for bulls on tesla is It"
"6890340","6899760"," wouldn't be surprising to see tesla need time And you're talking about tesla needing Time some time"
"6899760","6905940"," like consolidation time Um, where you're looking for like i'm looking for that squeeze hired, of"
"6905940","6907360"," course, like but can we get 200?"
"6908220","6918280"," but the reality is Even if they're buying here You're"
"6918280","6925980"," more than likely looking for a consolidation zone for tesla over time Right This could take a year."
"6926180","6932200"," I know it sounds crazy But this could take it this could on the long end take a year like"
"6932200","6938880"," right there You could be trading tesla in this zone for a full year Just just think about that Um"
"6938880","6946020"," that you could be in this zone easily for a full year And see a low down here Um fall"
"6946020","6955970"," or winter, you know And I if"
"6955970","6970920"," you're a bull if you're a tesla bull man, you've got to be You need to battle above here And"
"6970920","6980900"," you're not even bullish And this is right now 277 277 I think you're not even bullish on"
"6980900","6990480"," tesla like a bullish outlook on tesla Until you see a move like this and something like this right"
"6990480","6999600"," here I mean you can't even begin to get bullish on tesla and not get rejected back down here You"
"6999600","7006860"," see my point So tesla bulls have some serious work Ahead of them. "
"7007100","7016960"," I think that was part of my discussion with you guys has been People asked what's my plan and i'm"
"7016960","7018140"," like well i'm buying a hundred bucks."
"7018240","7019560"," I'll buy 90 bucks."
"7019640","7026780"," I'll buy 60 bucks And uh the underlying and and look for you know for that one to three years"
"7027440","7037420"," Um or five years to hold Some of"

"7042680","7044240"," up here when we're up here. "
"7044940","7053240"," I usually I usually sell my holdings And I I talk about it publicly on twitter and I piss off"
"7053240","7055860"," tesla gang And then I go after it."
"7055920","7061100"," I'll sometimes find people telling people I'm supposed to see fine like tesla bulls saying fuck"
"7061100","7064040"," yeah buy up here man Just keep buying just keep buying."
"7064160","7070340"," I'm like that's because of some guy bought it down here And If he just wants you to keep buying"
"7070340","7077000"," the higher it goes this guy doesn't care It's like the guy that's down here Like this guy down here"
"7078060","7079640"," The guy that owns here, right?"
"7080000","7083480"," So at least explain this I was trying to explain this yesterday I was in a rent but which I"
"7083480","7087660"," do with a smile on my face So if I buy tesla here, right?"
"7092220","7100540"," A lot of people if we're up here If we're coming up here Some some real psychopaths will be like"
"7100540","7110340"," this is a psychopath right here A real psychopath"

"7144880","7146680"," He's gonna be waiting for a low down here."
"7146740","7147360"," Does that make sense?"
"7149160","7153800"," Now, I don't know if this guy over here is a psychopath or not But I'm gonna assume that if"
"7153800","7159460"," you listen to that psychopath down there by the time he's angry down here He's probably gonna turn"
"7159460","7165160"," into a psychopath too And tell them a few bats of investors when we're up here to buy But my"
"7165160","7170100"," point to you is when when I see this on social media, of course I step in and I'm like"
"7170100","7175360"," don't buy this shit Buy down here and the reason that you reason you buy down here Is because"

"9543760","9548000"," lost that one minute and it fucking went down And then it didn't even keep going down."
"9548200","9553440"," This was bullshit right here too Like this is total bullshit and then we went down into the clothes"
"9553440","9559800"," and we had a lower target here We didn't hit this lower target until after hours So it's like it's"
"9559800","9564260"," like yeah, you get this and this didn't even print that heavy You didn't get there wasn't a huge"

"9605040","9609840"," was like I should have instead of fucking around the second half of the day with zero dates I"
"9609840","9615920"," should have just bought two day puts and some two day calls Uh some some outside the money fucking"
"9615920","9621620"," calls for the clothes on friday and some in the money puts for friday And whole just held them"
"9622240","9626600"," Until they fucking printed or burned so I was a little pissed off at at the action at the end"
"9626600","9631880"," of the day yesterday um I was a little pissed off at myself and I was a little pissed off"
"9631880","9638440"," at uh Uh, you could see it right when we were at that break yesterday I went into the options"
"9638440","9645280"," chain and I was like, I know we're going down here Why are they only only uh pricing in the"
"9645280","9652740"," low at 11 and I think they priced in 390 at like Or something We talked about it on stream"
"9652740","9659920"," yesterday And I was just I was fucking pissy because I'm like Well, if they're not priced like I'm"
"9659920","9665180"," like, why are these puts not at least 20 cents Why are that they're not building in some house"
"9665180","9671740"," money in there some premium in there anything And uh, so I was like scratching my head And with"
"9671740","9689800"," indecision And of course the trade was you just fucking buy them and hold them I That's"
"9689800","9699420"," being actively exploited Yeah, it was I found dude yesterday"
"9699420","9700480"," yesterday."

"9705700","9719390"," control myself because I was so fucking pissed off I mean,"
"9719450","9739540"," this is bullshit right here Like perfect setup right one two three blast off At"
"9739540","9750620"," 1 p.m. Eastern time the u.s. So 17 billion dollars in 10 years Yeah"
"9758540","9794690"," Yes gpm can with that one During"
"9794690","9804470"," Yeah, you're gonna hear japie Well, so the JPM caller, man, you should hear JPM talking about lower"
"9804470","9811430"," lows, because they're positioned for lower lows, they're positioned long for the first leg up, and"
"9811430","9813250"," now they've bought their puts for free. "
"9814210","9819690"," And so they now own, they now own a short in the market going down to 3065."
"9820370","9824430"," Well, that's that's how that whole bear seagull works."
"9835320","9837380"," You got my having my microphone problems?"
"9837480","9839120"," Can you guys hear me out there just fine or no?"
"9845740","9851680"," Yeah, no, I got so yesterday we hit our targets and so yesterday morning, right?"

"9855100","9859360"," I get on Twitter and I'm like, I'm like, hey, I'm like, we're gonna fucking hear targets."
"9860480","9862580"," So we fucking so I'm waiting for the fucking open."
"9862640","9865360"," I'm like, I can't get on the I'm like, I can't do a live stream right away. "
"9865360","9867700"," I got to fucking cash out fucking stoked."
"9868160","9872100"," Like my rule is if I get my rule is if I get over coming open, right?"
"9872300","9873280"," I'm holding anything overnight."
"9873740","9874900"," We take profit and run. "
"9875400","9876220"," That's the rule here."
"9876380","9880900"," Everybody knows that my rule is if we hit our fucking target, I take the money and run."
"9880900","9886060"," Look for a reposition of bounce to trade the bounce or whatever or trade or sell the rip or"
"9886060","9886720"," whatever it is. "
"9887400","9888440"," It's like off a bell."
"9888640","9892940"," If it's going my way, I fucking sell every fucking day, right?"
"9893200","9894460"," So that's all I'm trying to do yesterday."
"9895460","9900480"," And then I come on the live stream yesterday and I'm trying to do a market try to go over"
"9900480","9904080"," the market with everybody in the market and the market's fucking starting to sell and I'm not even"
"9904080","9905160"," paying attention to it. "
"9905160","9907600"," Don't even realize the market's selling right after."
"9907680","9910800"," Well, not right after Bell, but a few minutes after the ball starts selling."
"9911140","9912960"," It's like consolidating for a leg lower. "
"9913520","9914460"," So I miss all that."
"9914700","9921380"," I get finally get into trade yesterday and I just got shaken out, shaken out, shaken out, shaken"
"9921380","9921700"," out."
"9921920","9924560"," And then I was like, well, I was like, I'll buy some calls for Friday. "
"9924960","9927040"," I'll buy the bell for some calls for Friday."
"9927780","9930560"," I'm like, I doubt we get the leg lower overnight."
"9930920","9931020"," Maybe. "
"9931440","9934620"," I'm like, maybe we do, but the chance of it's low."
"9934840","9936360"," And then we got the leg lower in the overnight."
"9938280","9943220"," And I'm like, man, I'm like, this next two fucking days, we're probably going to trade sideways and"
"9943220","9947260"," then creepy crawl right up the fucking Friday wall at the close. "
"9947260","9952460"," I'm like, that's probably the way that you fuck everybody is that you just trade sideways for two"
"9952460","9952700"," days."
"9952700","9958340"," The last 15 minutes, 400 C's are worth fucking one, two pennies."
"9958760","9961400"," And they print like 12 cents, 18 cents. "
"9962520","9963680"," The spreads get covered."
"9964260","9966300"," Traders, you know, thank you for playing."
"9966580","9967660"," It's a short week this week. "
"9968040","9968960"," It's four fucking days."
"9969240","9971460"," So the move is done, right?"
"9971880","9974260"," In a four day week, you get one move and then you're kind of done."
"9974260","9980180"," And even next week's expansion or volatility expansion range is small. "
"9980520","9985300"," We don't really get the really big move or they don't price in for us to get a bigger move"
"9985300","9988760"," on the first, not on not next week."
"9991280","9993860"," Yeah, we're losing this right now."
"9995900","9997800"," We're losing the trigger right now. "
"9997840","9999220"," We're losing the one minute and the five minute."
"9999220","10002740"," Let's turn on bears"
"10002740","10010340"," right"
"10010340","10016220"," now."
"10039670","10041830"," I don't know why. "
"10045900","10047220"," Fucking FOMO bears."
"10052060","10055480"," They're just like FOMO bulls always in at the end."
"10068960","10071000"," Delaying the inevitable rip higher. "
"10072020","10075960"," Well, you got dealers to dealers don't dealers don't want to fucking pay anybody."
"10092870","10094710"," Yeah, there's no real battle zone here."
"10094790","10096430"," This is more about I don't know. "
"10096990","10098990"," I think I disagree with it being a battle zone here."
"10100330","10101510"," You've got buyers."
"10101910","10103810"," So you've got smart money buyers down here. "
"10104050","10105810"," So it's like a magnet down below over here."
"10107150","10110690"," And so you got that going on here, right?"
"10111670","10113010"," There's no like down with it."
"10113170","10114590"," The bears don't want to give this up. "
"10114710","10115410"," I'm saying I say that."
"10115670","10121830"," This is like I'm using like a euphemism saying bears don't want to give this up."
"10123810","10128170"," The reality is that's not the real reason where we're pinned right here. "
"10130370","10132770"," These are people cashing out puts."
"10138100","10140560"," Or larger players than the smaller players."
"10141020","10143600"," Then you get the retail bears like down down down. "
"10143840","10145060"," I need to get paid more."
"10145780","10148280"," All these con are all these things going on in the background."
"10159590","10162730"," Shades of blues brothers cocaine bear. "
"10163950","10166270"," I still haven't watched cocaine bear."

"10178350","10181230"," Yeah, it's basically a pin exactly a drip yield. "
"10185950","10187870"," Obviously I haven't done Brent oil yet."
"10188550","10190070"," I haven't done big tech yet."
"10190150","10193810"," I haven't done part of the sectors yet. "
"10196170","10199050"," And I haven't brought myself a spread for Friday."
"10199230","10199790"," I need to do that."
"10201890","10207770"," Talked about the fall of the USSR. I should probably put a call spread on for the close for"
"10207770","10208470"," tomorrow."
"10210030","10212290"," You guys want to look at a spread for tomorrow?"
"10213150","10214190"," I got something cool for you."
"10214850","10216570"," If you're not a big time spread trader. "
"10218730","10221070"," This is like basic spreads options one on one."
"10227530","10230230"," So I'm supposed to speak with these guys."
"10230470","10231470"," I haven't spoken to them. "
"10235270","10238090"," But they want to they want to do something together with me."
"10238190","10239070"," I guess or they've not."
"10239170","10239970"," I don't think they want to. "
"10240070","10241390"," But they said you want to do something together."
"10241570","10242250"," We could talk about it."
"10243550","10245610"," But I do like this program for. "
"10246130","10252890"," I do like this program for new traders that only like so many fucking traders only buy."
"10254210","10259170"," Like the buy puts and they'll buy calls and they might buy the underlying stock."
"10259330","10260170"," They never short a stock. "
"10261110","10263830"," They never do poor main cover calls."
"10264110","10265190"," They never do the wheel."
"10265430","10267970"," They never do butterflies and condors and. "
"10269490","10274150"," Not even like basic shit like credit spreads debit spreads."
"10275450","10279570"," So they get fucked up and they don't get leverage."
"10281910","10283570"," So we'll do is we're going to look at. "
"10284070","10285610"," I know we're going up here and I want to."

"10388530","10390710"," Price target above remains the same. "
"10391210","10394010"," 389.71. We're on we're on target."
"10394710","10396090"," You guys ready to make some money?"
"10399500","10399960"," Finally."
"10400180","10401460"," Make me some fucking money. "
"10407790","10410230"," They're going to try to be a little bit of volatility in here."
"10410470","10412870"," You should see a tiny bit of volatility like right here."
"10418440","10419700"," So you can visualize that. "
"10419960","10421840"," They're going to try to make some volatility."
"10422580","10423600"," But we're going to try to get up here."
"10423980","10425940"," Some of you guys might want to take profit right here. "
"10427540","10430040"," Don't be like, Hey, Kevin Jim told me we're going all the way up here."
"10430120","10430500"," We didn't."
"10430600","10432280"," You can take profit like right here if you wanted. "
"10432280","10435140"," It should be it should go something like this."
"10436980","10440500"," At least to their consolidation and then move higher."
"10441620","10443800"," But there can be a rollover, right?"
"10444200","10446900"," All rips get sold when you're in negative gamma or. "
"10447260","10448380"," Yeah, negative gamma."
"10448380","10448720"," Sorry."
"10448800","10453680"," I'm trying to make sure I'm not misspeaking in chat here or in livestream with you. "
"10455120","10457120"," Don't watch this real closely for a minute."
"10457120","10460340"," You guys want to put up a book map and I'll come back to a spread for you."
"10461000","10461780"," Just a minute. "
"10463600","10467880"," So I don't trade spreads because they get so caught up in zero dates that I'm like, I missed the"
"10467880","10468160"," spread."
"10470620","10473900"," How'd you miss the spread?"
"10474120","10475020"," I was trading zero dates."
"10492740","10495180"," Now trading 78 cents. "
"10495440","10495880"," Shut up."
"10497040","10498660"," Shut up new squawk."
"10498720","10499660"," We're trying to make money here. "
"10502430","10503570"," 79 cents."
"10503830","10504650"," Now 50 cent calls."
"10504930","10506590"," Now trading 78 cents. "
"10508210","10508810"," Whoo."
"10513450","10515070"," Just sold for a dollar."
"10515530","10516050"," Fuck yeah. "
"10516050","10516250"," Yeah."
"10517310","10518450"," Fuck yeah."
"10520610","10522290"," Just sold cons for a dollar. "
"10522990","10523930"," Oh, baby."
"10525070","10525950"," Whoo."
"10529020","10530220"," Oh, yeah. "
"10532980","10534200"," Blast off."
"10536980","10538520"," Ram it up their ass."
"10545520","10548300"," Single boner on the spy baby. "
"10551140","10552820"," Three to nine C's."
"10553080","10554420"," Now trading a dollar five."

"10561660","10563200"," I'm flying right now in that trade."
"10564400","10565840"," Now trading a dollar ten. "
"10571860","10573580"," Go take your money and run."
"10573940","10575240"," Remember it's all the rip."
"10576780","10578220"," To get too greedy. "
"10582780","10583860"," God damn."
"10586080","10588100"," I feel like I'm working for a living."
"10590140","10591820"," I don't want to work for a living. "
"10603740","10604320"," Nice."
"10606140","10607760"," Three to nine's back to like 105."
"10608040","10609720"," I'm five though right now in that trade. "
"10610740","10611640"," Actually, I got to check."
"10611760","10613660"," So I get some fucking calls for the 20th."
"10619440","10620860"," Oh, dude, they are destroyed. "
"10622060","10623900"," I should have sold those right on the fucking bell."
"10624060","10625180"," I should have known better than this."
"10625360","10626900"," I should have sold them right on the bell this morning. "
"10627900","10629580"," That's too busy fucking blabbing."
"10632220","10635680"," They're going to print like one penny in the money tomorrow."
"10638040","10639160"," That was fucking awesome. "
"10639540","10640120"," That was good."
"10643520","10644540"," I take the money."
"10645100","10647340"," We'll look for a little bit of consolidation here. "
"10656490","10658410"," I don't bullshit right here."
"10660910","10663050"," This is what happens in a negative gamma environment."
"10663270","10664070"," They sell the rip here. "
"10668410","10669790"," Everybody's taking their money and leaving."
"10670510","10671890"," Dealers hate us, don't they?"
"10674310","10678090"," I bet there's a dealer somewhere out there that's like I hate these fucking retailers."
"10684670","10691490"," That was a nice little rip. "
"10691970","10694950"," That was a nice little little little little bit of cocaine for the morning."
"10695710","10696850"," It made me happy right there."
"10706480","10708860"," I'll take a hundred percent print all day long. "
"10708860","10711600"," I'll take a hundred percent trade for 15 minutes of work."
"10715770","10716930"," Let's talk about spreads."
"10717410","10718230"," Chasing bring up spreads. "
"10719930","10721230"," Price targets still get above."
"10723070","10724510"," Let me look at a few things here."
"10726110","10728210"," Let's take a couple of things here for tomorrow. "
"10729970","10731730"," We're still kind of sideways here."
"10736600","10738020"," Cooling off here for a minute."
"10738380","10740620"," We definitely want to buy spreads in that squeeze, do we?"
"10742340","10743940"," We're so fucking filthy. "
"10746380","10747380"," We're fucking terrible."
"10751040","10751520"," Okay."
"10752100","10752900"," That was a good morning. "
"10753100","10753260"," Sorry."
"10753580","10754640"," That was a good trade right there."
"10754840","10756000"," It's outstanding fucking trade. "
"10757660","10758820"," I'll calm down now."
"10760840","10761720"," All right."
"10761860","10765120"," So for any of you, DJN's out there that have tried not to be a DJN. "
"10765200","10768260"," This is options.ai. I don't trade on this platform."
"10770640","10773380"," But I might trade with you guys on this platform."
"10775420","10781420"," I was thinking about using this platform to trade oversold call spreads. "
"10784100","10785540"," They know who I am."
"10785600","10788300"," So if you want to sign up at least, it costs nothing."
"10788760","10794920"," If you're a degenerate trader and you don't want to be a degenerate anymore, and I'm not sponsored"
"10794920","10798940"," by these people in any way, shape or form, but still Tom say, Kevin, Jim, James sent you whatever. "
"10799900","10801520"," When you sign up, I caught you here about us."
"10802820","10804120"," But I get no money or nothing."
"10804120","10805520"," I'm not associated with these people. "
"10805820","10812340"," But I'd like to do like their site because it's an entry level way to understand simple call"
"10812340","10812780"," spreads."
"10814140","10820320"," And we're probably going to run some kind of a, you'll watch me trade like a thousand bucks or"
"10820320","10820700"," something."
"10821100","10825100"," You'll watch me trade a thousand dollars on this is my best trade that I do. "
"10825660","10828140"," I have a very high win rate with this trade."
"10828720","10829460"," We're not going to do it."
"10829540","10831880"," We're not there yet to take this trade. "
"10832660","10837020"," But when super oversold situations, I'll put out a call spread."
"10838620","10847220"," Now, Chase had said something this morning about, you know, you could pin here sideways into"
"10847220","10847640"," tomorrow."
"10848020","10848920"," So I just typed in spy. "
"10849600","10852980"," I know some of you guys have already gotten this whole bunch of people in the stream."
"10853080","10853880"," We've already gotten this platform."
"10855800","10857460"," So I just typed in spy. "
"10857880","10863800"," This shows the implied move that's coming for different strikes on whatever ticket you type in."
"10863800","10865520"," This is the first thing you left with."
"10865620","10866260"," So I'm looking at the spy. "
"10866500","10866620"," Okay."
"10867840","10871280"," You can pick a week, a month, a three months or one year."
"10872020","10878280"," So if you just, if you just like a new trader or whatever, you can execute these on Robinhood,"
"10878500","10880240"," wherever you, wherever you trade we will. "
"10881020","10884500"," But the simplicity of constructing a simple spread."
"10884760","10890600"," This is one of the best brokerages that I've seen in their layout on how to understand the"
"10890600","10892580"," mechanics of a basic spread."
"10892580","10893940"," This is why I like it. "
"10895320","10897060"," And they got some really cool shit here, too."
"10897320","10904440"," Like they show implied ball for ER dates for every ticker."
"10904820","10906560"," They do some really cool shit on this website. "
"10907040","10910300"," So you can explore it on your own cost nothing to sign up."
"10912320","10912720"," Okay."
"10912960","10915080"," So I typed in the spy and chase. "
"10915460","10919600"," So I just, so let's say I didn't know Chase and Chase said, Hey, take a look at three ninety"
"10919600","10922220"," nine, three ninety seven call spreads for Friday."
"10923040","10923820"," And I'm like, Oh, yeah."
"10923900","10924120"," Okay. "
"10924140","10924620"," I'm going to do that."
"10924780","10925760"," So I'm going to click on one week."
"10926540","10926900"," Right. "
"10927660","10929000"," I'm going to click on trade spy."
"10930100","10934460"," And I can pick what I want here, bullish, neutral or bearish."
"10935140","10935460"," Right. "
"10936080","10938320"," You could do a neutral trade here."
"10938460","10940020"," You can, you can't, I don't think you can sell."
"10940940","10946800"," I don't think you can actually sell like condors and butterflies on this site. "
"10946920","10948340"," But I think you can at least buy them."
"10949280","10959100"," And although you can buy, or you can buy and sell within a vertical or calendar spread"
"10959100","10960040"," bearish."
"10960120","10962360"," Same kind of like debit and credit spreads debit and credit spreads. "
"10962580","10965780"," So he mentioned a call spread for tomorrow's close."
"10966900","10966940"," Right."
"10967860","10971820"," So we're just going to click on debit spread and then you pick the date. "
"10972420","10973900"," We know that 20th is this Friday."
"10973900","10974940"," So we clicked on that."
"10975400","10977480"," We have the implied move for the close for tomorrow. "
"10977780","10977840"," Right."
"10978760","10982260"," Point eight percent up or down and we're bullish."
"10982260","10983100"," So we have that context. "
"10983680","10985140"," And then you can pick just a call."
"10985400","10990020"," I would never recommend using a brokerage like this or Robinhood for just buying calls."
"10990840","10996320"," Personally, you should have a legit brokerage, think or swim, tasty, whatever you like, light"
"10996320","10996600"," speed. "
"10996800","10997880"," I don't care what you use."
"10998820","11003220"," Book map, wherever you go through, get a legit broker with legitimate charting and all that kind of"
"11003220","11003420"," stuff."
"11004060","11005120"," They get debit call spread. "
"11005300","11007600"," But if you're constructing a simple spread, this is a kickass brokerage."
"11008160","11008160"," Okay."
"11008160","11015660"," debit call spread credit put spread and it gives you your mass max risk and your max gain your"
"11015660","11017000"," probability of profit. "
"11017820","11017900"," Right."
"11018440","11021020"," 75% profit probability of profit."
"11021380","11027060"," If you're if you're bullish and you only get you make 22 bucks than 78 and you can edit these"
"11027060","11027900"," if you pick one. "
"11027900","11029440"," So we're just going to go to the simple one."
"11029560","11030220"," debit call spread."
"11030980","11031100"," Right. "
"11031420","11032880"," Max risk, 108 bucks."
"11034240","11036640"," Max gain, 192 dollars, pretty good."
"11037160","11039600"," 41% probability, believe it or not, is a very high probability. "
"11040420","11043980"," Anything like 50 60% is a high probability trade, believe it or not."
"11044860","11045980"," debit call spread."
"11046220","11046300"," Okay. "
"11047540","11047960"," Clicked on it."
"11048620","11049600"," And this is cool."
"11049740","11052360"," The curse is going to show you where you where you make money. "
"11053100","11053180"," Right."
"11053740","11058240"," Some of it, they don't what they don't show you is time matters here to this parts of the mechanics"
"11058240","11061100"," of this, these trades that aren't explained here."
"11061180","11067880"," Well, the risk of assignment in these trades, but for a new trader trying to visualize how these"
"11067880","11068660"," trades are constructed. "
"11068880","11072340"," It's not a bad brokerage, you know, basic stuff."
"11072580","11077620"," This is where I lose money because you do you make money over time as these spreads end."
"11077620","11083920"," And then down here, max risk percentage of profit, max gain, and you can actually edit this. "
"11084140","11089580"," So this box changes where your profit is and how much it costs you see it right now."
"11089640","11090320"," It's a dollar 12."
"11090940","11092200"," So let's say I went into edit. "
"11093100","11094460"," And then I'm like, yeah."
"11094940","11098680"," And you can just just as a if you're new trading, like in your, in your, like of a directional"
"11098680","11099180"," bias."
"11099820","11101000"," And you're like, you know what?"
"11102300","11108860"," I think we close on Friday, no less than 390 or no less than 385. "
"11109660","11111520"," You could do this spread right now for."
"11111920","11112560"," Hold on."
"11113680","11117840"," Let's say you like, let's see, like I'm not bullish into, you know, take cap. "
"11117980","11120780"," I'm not bullish into Friday, but I don't think we're going down anymore this week."
"11120780","11124660"," You could just click 384 or 385 or 384."
"11125560","11127400"," Save the strike, right?"
"11127620","11128320"," You could click three. "
"11130660","11133240"," 388, let's say, save the strike."
"11133880","11135660"," And right here, it costs you $305."
"11136640","11142020"," You make $95 just to close within 384, 388. "
"11142480","11143220"," So let's look at that."
"11144240","11144640"," Okay."
"11145400","11146600"," You're going to risk $305. "
"11147180","11149140"," You have a max gain of $95."
"11150060","11156220"," And if you, when you learn how to trade spreads like this, you can cut a leg off because you're"
"11156220","11158300"," buying a call and you're selling a call."
"11160260","11164860"," So you could actually cut a leg off if we start to sell off and just hold one side of"
"11164860","11165220"," the trade. "
"11166200","11171520"," You need to do your own due diligence and education and go down the rabbit hole of understanding"
"11171520","11173120"," how to manage these spreads."
"11173840","11178080"," But on a basic, on a basic idea, like, let's say you're like, oh, I bought some zero dates or"
"11178080","11178940"," some one day calls."
"11179600","11182540"," And it went to where I wanted them to go, but it didn't pay me. "
"11183100","11188820"," The dealers fucked me, the market makers fucked me, the bears fucked me, whatever you want to blame"
"11188820","11189120"," it on."
"11189120","11193000"," And, you know, our price right now is $3,907."
"11194040","11197880"," So all you need to do between now and tomorrow is not close below. "
"11199400","11204960"," I believe that's, well, I don't know why it's, oh, $3,722."
"11205720","11212480"," You have to just close above $3,722, $3,727 flat."
"11212660","11214520"," I'm sorry, something like that. "
"11215500","11218260"," And down here, yeah, down here, let me see if I get this right."
"11219460","11220860"," And I know that's a break even."
"11221160","11222480"," $3,7 flat. "
"11223420","11225760"," You have to just close above there tomorrow."
"11226540","11227800"," So $3,7 flat, right?"
"11228560","11234440"," So this is, so if we're looking at this, if we're looking at this chart in a five day, right?"
"11239130","11240670"," So this is a five day, right?"
"11241290","11243250"," All you have to do by tomorrow."
"11244490","11251080"," All you have to do, I know some of you guys already know how to do this shit, so if"
"11251080","11253080"," you're a long-time trader, you don't need to hear any of this. "
"11253520","11259060"," All you have to do, basically, is not close below here."
"11259900","11268240"," As long as you don't close down here, you can close anywhere you want in here tomorrow, and you're"
"11268240","11268800"," going to make money."
"11269540","11272240"," It doesn't matter if it takes until 4.12 in the afternoon. "
"11272980","11276820"," It doesn't matter if we sell like a bloodbath again, and then we come sweeping up here."
"11276920","11283320"," It doesn't matter if we bloodbath down below here, and then come sneaking back up and close just"
"11283320","11283920"," right here."
"11284540","11286360"," It's got a fucking print for you. "
"11287660","11289140"," Okay, you understand what I'm saying?"
"11292980","11301660"," So if you're feeling like a degenerate gambler, hold on, if you're looking at a degenerate gambler,"
"11301680","11303300"," it's not that bad of a trade, right?"
"11304020","11304700"," It's pretty good."
"11304880","11307020"," It's a fair probability of profit."
"11307660","11310700"," You're risking 300 to make 100 bucks. "
"11311420","11312240"," Not bad, right?"
"11313640","11315960"," And you can manage this trade if you learn how to trade spreads."
"11315960","11319800"," You could literally cut one side off if it starts going south on you."
"11321080","11325880"," You can cut the long call side off and actually start printing some serious money if we start"
"11325880","11326720"," bloodbathing it. "
"11327800","11329520"," So these are just basic spreads."
"11329940","11330820"," This is actually a pretty good one."
"11331260","11339860"," Now Chase said, I like the idea of the safety of a call spread, but I want to take a"
"11339860","11342000"," lotto, but I don't want to spend a ton of money on it. "
"11343140","11344940"," So wait a minute, let's go back."
"11348400","11352360"," So Chase was like, let's do 397s and 399s."
"11352400","11358540"," The reason he was saying this, so 397 or 399, excuse me, right?"
"11358700","11359700"," There's your high side, 399. "
"11360300","11362680"," And here's the low side right here, 397."
"11363200","11366040"," And you don't have to remember if you're buying or selling calls."
"11367320","11371460"," You don't need to remember any of that crap here, but I'm going to show you some cool. "
"11372340","11374120"," I think I can show you some cool."
"11374580","11376020"," So 397, okay?"
"11376580","11380320"," So 399, 397, and it shows you down here."
"11380400","11381060"," It costs you $4. "
"11382020","11384060"," Your max gain is $196."
"11385340","11387760"," Your probability of profit is 4%."
"11387760","11389220"," But we know how the market works. "
"11389380","11394280"," We know that dealers at the last minute will sneak this shit up, right?"
"11394540","11399320"," Right into the bell, like four o'clock, 357, 412 in the afternoon."
"11400280","11403520"," They'll sneak this shit up and you'll be surprised, okay?"
"11404140","11404600"," Four bucks."
"11404780","11405620"," That's not too bad, right?"
"11407200","11410600"," So let's say I go, ah, you know what, it's $4. "
"11411900","11415520"," Can I go any lower and still pay around four bucks?"
"11416220","11417140"," Big question, right?"
"11417800","11418540"," Four dollars."
"11418840","11422640"," Is that the best spread to buy for four dollars, right?"
"11423160","11424140"," And sometimes it's not."
"11424420","11430040"," So what I would do at 397, 379, is I might go down a little bit. "
"11430400","11432560"," So for six bucks, I make $194."
"11432900","11433760"," Cost me a little bit more."
"11433840","11434220"," You see that?"
"11434800","11436040"," I want you to see that, okay?"
"11436140","11440780"," I want you to see costs $4 to make 196. "
"11442220","11443540"," $6 to make 194."
"11445420","11446940"," But I can go down a little bit."
"11447140","11451340"," Well, 398, 396, $12 and make $188. "
"11452120","11453560"," That's pretty goddamn good too, right?"
"11453560","11457300"," For 18, this is 18 actual dollars, right?"
"11457400","11457920"," It's pretty cheap."
"11458300","11461060"," $18 to make 200 at 396."
"11461920","11466040"," For 30 bucks, I can make 170, right?"
"11466780","11471560"," 40 bucks, 160, 58 bucks, 142 dollars. "
"11473080","11475180"," 390, I can make 128."
"11475820","11477580"," That's fucking slamming right there, right?"
"11478900","11480180"," 112 for 88."
"11480660","11483220"," So right around here, 389 to 391. "
"11484000","11485260"," 391 is kind of tough to make."
"11486020","11490720"," That's a pretty fair trade if you're super, uber, duper bullish, and you don't have to care about"
"11490720","11491660"," any of the theta burn."
"11492340","11496120"," You don't have to care about anything that's dicking around, and it only has to hit your strike as"
"11496120","11498240"," we get into at least once, right?"
"11498420","11499440"," You're going to make some kind of money. "
"11500760","11506700"," So let's say you press to continue, you took that trade, you press to continue, and then you're"
"11506700","11508060"," reviewing your order here."
"11508680","11512960"," You can decide, uh, you can put your bid in right here."
"11513080","11517780"," Let's say your, let's say your, let's say your, your bid to the ask right now is 93 cents. "
"11518600","11520360"," The bid is 90 cents."
"11520660","11523120"," Typically when I'm trying to open a spread, I'll go a little bit higher."
"11523920","11528660"," And then once you place the trade, let's say you put your bid in for 92, it fills. "
"11529160","11530720"," Sometimes you won't get a fill, sometimes you will."
"11531060","11534060"," Spy, you could usually get a decent fill because it has a ton of liquidity."
"11534060","11540640"," Let's say you get your fill at 92 cents, and then immediately, what I do immediately is, let's say"
"11540640","11546300"," I bought it for 92 cents, I'm automatically trying to sell it for 30% of profit. "
"11547000","11551440"," So if my, if my profit is, let's say I'm going to make 92 cents on this 92 cents trade,"
"11551840","11558320"," I would immediately put a limit sell on it for $1.24 or something and just let it ride."
"11559160","11559900"," Just let it ride."
"11561140","11562860"," And then I'm going to go back to my day trading. "
"11563300","11566640"," I'm just going to let it sit in the background and hopefully I get a full fill on it at"
"11566640","11567340"," 30%."
"11568700","11569500"," Does that make sense?"
"11569880","11572600"," So if it starts blasting off higher, time starts burning."
"11573560","11577480"," I'm not looking for 100% trade personally, but you guys, some of you guys are, some of you guys"
"11577480","11579300"," are going to diamond hand that shit into the, into the bell. "
"11580880","11582320"," But for me, I'm not."
"11582540","11584600"," I'm just trying to get 30% of whatever."
"11585360","11587360"," And let me go back and explain this in a better way for you. "
"11589380","11591200"," Let me go back and actually edit this for you."
"11591300","11598060"," So right here, right, three, 16, we're going to change this, three, six, right?"
"11598860","11602480"," So I want you to see what I typically, how I typically structure these for me."
"11603800","11606720"," I'm looking to make 300% on the initial trade. "
"11608500","11611820"," So I'm looking for some, a trade like this is what I do."
"11612820","11615360"," It's actually a perfect trade for me, right?"
"11616460","11622800"," I'll place the trade for $42 to make $158."
"11623780","11631420"," And I'm literally going to set this, the limit cell for 40 or, excuse me, 88 cents. "
"11633940","11636020"," So I'll take this trade, it costs me $44."
"11637040","11643460"," And this is about a third, a third of the, of the trade."
"11643460","11648100"," So I'm not looking to make all the trade, but I still made 100% even though I would have"
"11648100","11649700"," made 300 to be greedy. "
"11650580","11654060"," Usually you get an easier fill in here for only 30% of the trade."
"11654780","11656760"," Not always, but you will."
"11656980","11659360"," And so that's what I'm looking for when I, when I place the trade. "
"11659920","11660980"," That's just me personally."
"11661700","11663420"," Now you can place that trade."
"11663960","11665160"," You can place that trade. "
"11666200","11671320"," How, once you construct that trade, it actually shows you, depending on if you're doing credit"
"11671320","11675700"," spread or debit spread or condor or butterfly, it actually has a little line."
"11675960","11679140"," I, I deleted, I just turned the website off, but it shows you."
"11679820","11681800"," You're buying a call and selling a call. "
"11683040","11686460"," You're, you're buying these calls and you're selling these puts."
"11687160","11689300"," You're selling these puts and buying these calls."
"11689540","11690680"," It actually shows you the construct. "
"11691180","11696660"," So you could go over like Robinhood or something and just click on like buy call, sell put, buy"
"11696660","11704120"," call, sell call, and the prices that you construct it in on this, on this website and trade it"
"11704120","11705120"," somewhere else if you wanted."
"11705820","11708220"," You can trade with them with options."
"11708540","11714920"," I typically trade on my main broke or I've got a, so I use, I think, or nothing is from"
"11714920","11715360"," tasty. "
"11716280","11718960"," And tasty allows me to have different accounts on one brokerage."
"11719540","11725500"," Some of these brokerage or some of these trading platforms only allow you to have one brokerage or,"
"11725660","11727520"," sorry, one account on one brokerage."
"11728520","11734200"," So for me personally, I have trades and investments and different, and different accounts on one"
"11734200","11734500"," brokerage. "
"11734920","11735780"," I'm not wording this correctly."
"11736680","11743620"," So you decide what you need to do, what works best for you, and yeah, so that's it right there."
"11743740","11745080"," So that's, that's Chase's trade. "
"11745700","11752620"," Chase's idea is this is that Chase's idea is that he knows there's a pin up here."
"11752740","11756460"," He knows that there's spreads out there that institutions have."
"11756800","11763240"," And he knows that dealers don't want to pay on that on that on that pin at 400. "
"11763740","11767200"," He knows that they're going to pay him at some point."
"11767200","11769580"," So he thinks it's going to be something like this up in here."
"11770020","11772120"," We're going to sneak up here on Friday clothes. "
"11773340","11778100"," And I don't know how long he needs to stay in this trade, but probably into the, probably into the"
"11778100","11778740"," clothes of Friday."
"11782140","11785420"," And he, I'm assuming that he's saying, that's $4."
"11785880","11787040"," What does that fucking cost me?"
"11787760","11789000"," I can throw 40 bucks at that. "
"11789120","11790660"," I can throw 400 bucks at that."
"11791340","11793940"," And if it prints it prints, if it burns, I don't care."
"11794360","11795560"," I think that's his logic. "
"11795960","11800400"," If I'm wrong, let me know in the chat."
"11800400","11806340"," Yeah, $4 and 200."
"11806700","11806920"," Absolutely. "
"11807680","11813160"," On trades like that, you typically have to hold it right to the fucking bitter end because you"
"11813160","11813820"," won't get a fill."
"11815300","11817940"," So you'll need to hammer the fucking fill button."
"11818320","11819640"," Well, not the fill button, but the. "
"11821220","11826060"," You probably, you probably have, or like there's usually a spread up between the bid and the ask to"
"11826060","11827020"," get a fill to close them."
"11827020","11830840"," So you're probably going to have to fuck with it, hand fuck with it into the clothes."
"11832700","11835800"," Like if, like let's say it says you're in the money for $196. "
"11837020","11838800"," You might have to be like, what about 192?"
"11839380","11840020"," What about 190?"
"11840380","11840860"," What about 188?"
"11841240","11841900"," Will you fill that one?"
"11843040","11844060"," But we're doing this in the spies."
"11844420","11845700"," So it's a very liquid environment."
"11850650","11852110"," Yeah, you don't have to home to the end. "
"11853270","11854590"," You don't have to home to the end."
"11860370","11862830"," Yeah, thanks for explaining in the chat, Chase."
"11862830","11871350"," Oh, look at that, huh?"
"11871570","11872370"," We got our tag above. "
"11872670","11873090"," You see that?"
"11873690","11874530"," Whoo-hoo."
"11875970","11877130"," So we tagged, right?"
"11880870","11881710"," Almost tagged."
"11882010","11882550"," What do we tag?"
"11882870","11885310"," One, we tagged, check it out. "
"11886390","11889370"," We were two pennies off on our price target above."
"11890050","11891230"," So we hit our price target."
"11892130","11893430"," You got to see that in chat. "
"11893910","11896630"," Do you guys know that we hit our price target above?"
"11897250","11898410"," You guys didn't say anything to me?"
"11902360","11905340"," You guys didn't say anything to me that we hit our price target above?"
"11906380","11907180"," You guys are mean."
"11908720","11909540"," There's no love."
"11914180","11915100"," Hold on here. "
"11915920","11917280"," I don't know why this doesn't want to."
"11917700","11918380"," There we go."
"11919160","11923980"," Okay, so we hit our 389.71 within two pennies. "
"11924120","11924500"," Did you see that?"
"11925200","11926500"," You all see that out there?"
"11926580","11927520"," We hit our 390 seat."
"11927520","11928120"," You all see that?"
"11929180","11931760"," You guys going to make a video about this and post it on Twitter?"
"11934440","11938440"," Highlight rail within two pennies price target hit."
"11938860","11940140"," I'm just fucking with you. "
"11943840","11945140"," Price target achieved."
"11945740","11947540"," We immediately sold off, right?"
"11948440","11950640"," Immediately sold off off the price target."
"11952860","11954880"," Take your money and run. "
"11955240","11958060"," A bunch of gangsters."
"11963720","11965020"," Price target achieved."
"11967100","11967100"," Okay. "
"11970840","11971920"," We'll look at it."
"11973440","11974500"," Hold on."
"11974680","11975200"," I did it again. "
"11975820","11976200"," Oopsie."
"11980980","11987860"," Okay, so you saw here on the pretty close, right?"
"11990460","11991200"," Came below."
"11992100","11992780"," Slammed higher. "
"11994120","11996660"," Came below and actually almost tagged."
"11999000","11999740"," Where we are?"
"11999900","12000720"," So where we looking right here?"
"12000840","12005760"," We're going to look for a trade below and see if we can hold again."
"12006620","12007880"," Three to eight sixty. "
"12011420","12018980"," So two places you want to look three, three to eight ninety nine and three eight sixty."
"12023450","12043480"," Okay, so three to eight ninety nine and three"
"12043480","12045060"," to eight sixty right here."
"12048430","12051310"," And we're going to look for a double top above. "
"12051810","12051910"," Okay."
"12062440","12063840"," You see the trade right here?"
"12065460","12070800"," No, you don't have to take this trade, but probably a double top right here for move leg lower."
"12072060","12075200"," If two places to add here and here. "
"12076960","12079520"," We'll look higher and see if we can break above."
"12080540","12083760"," We have a gap right here."
"12084600","12086100"," This is what bulls want. "
"12102130","12103290"," Let me look here."
"12112000","12112500"," Right here."
"12122820","12124420"," It does weird shit, Chase. "
"12125020","12126080"," You know what happens, Chase."
"12128790","12130730"," You know what, Chase knows what happens."
"12132450","12133890"," Well, we get weird. "
"12136970","12139430"," We'll get where what the fuck is going on with my."
"12154040","12155060"," Hold on a second here."
"12155220","12155900"," What's going on?"
"12156000","12156580"," Close that. "
"12156840","12157680"," Close that up."
"12167540","12169840"," We'll get weird shit that happens on on."
"12170320","12171840"," So this is a monthly OPEC's. "
"12172020","12174420"," So you guys understand this is a weekly OPEC's right."
"12174920","12176380"," This is a monthly OPEC's."
"12176620","12183020"," They will fucking they will they will run all kinds of scams into a monthly OPEC's all kinds of"
"12183020","12183320"," scams. "
"12196860","12199320"," Trade it right off trade it right off the trigger down below."
"12202640","12206040"," I should have taken that trade that second trade right here and I didn't."
"12208140","12209900"," Too busy fucking around it spreads. "
"12218920","12219800"," Yeah, we did it."
"12219900","12221900"," We did market breath indicator earlier today."
"12222920","12238120"," I'll take a look right now at it definite bid"
"12238120","12239020"," in the market this morning. "
"12243060","12246180"," You want to be looking at finance consumer staples."
"12248620","12249800"," You want to be looking at."
"12254650","12259730"," I'd be looking at utilities, believe it or not. "
"12263540","12264560"," I'm going to take a look at that right now."
"12265440","12267220"," The utilities get a bid this morning or no."
"12273260","12274520"," I never went back and checked. "
"12276860","12279460"," Never finished that sector like checking sectors."
"12279460","12280500"," I'm going to check right now."
"12284760","12285840"," Netflix caught a bid. "
"12290220","12291840"," The utilities catch a bit or no."
"12294040","12295760"," Yeah, utilities cut a bit down here."
"12302200","12304400"," I haven't checked the whole bunch of shit. "
"12304680","12305980"," I haven't checked the XLK yet."
"12308760","12310280"," XLK caught a bid this morning."
"12315060","12315620"," XLF. "
"12317980","12318540"," Whoa."
"12318960","12320520"," XLF caught a big bid."
"12321020","12321260"," Bullish. "
"12322460","12323020"," Bullish."
"12344640","12346740"," XLF got a giant bid this morning."
"12348940","12350520"," They fucking love XLF. "
"12350700","12352080"," This is bullish, believe it or not, the market."
"12354500","12357020"," We had more bid next to XLF than we did XLU."
"12361040","12366820"," That means we haven't sold out or we're not in a defensive position on that sell-off. "
"12367520","12368780"," You guys see the difference here?"
"12369500","12371620"," XLF got a strong bid this morning."
"12372580","12373680"," Stronger than XLU."
"12377420","12379120"," See how weak that bid is right here?"
"12382120","12388780"," If XLF had gotten less of a bid and XLU got a bigger bid, that would be defensive. "
"12391320","12392040"," That's telling."
"12392740","12394100"," Maybe we are still rotating."
"12395760","12397840"," The bulls can smell a whiff of hope. "
"12400680","12400960"," A whiff."
"12410320","12417680"," If you're a bear, you want to see XLU get a bid and XLF not catch a bid."
"12422070","12423070"," That's fascinating. "
"12424810","12434750"," Do you want to fit into it and ask around and say, hey, why"
"12434750","12437650"," is XLF catching a bid and XLU is not?"
"12438010","12438510"," See what they say."
"12440410","12442370"," I'm being facetious here, but you should ask."
"12446740","12448120"," It may break through right now. "
"12449320","12450260"," Price target above."
"12452820","12454340"," Let me get to that price target above."
"12459480","12460600"," We're getting bullish here. "
"12466990","12468490"," Hey, just heads up out there."
"12468710","12469410"," We're getting very bullish."
"12469650","12471770"," It's 1.35 in the afternoon. "
"12475030","12476570"," You guys remember we got a temper this?"
"12477890","12478730"," Pink tight here."
"12479730","12480670"," You guys ready for this?"
"12483070","12484430"," We're getting really bullish right here."
"12484430","12490530"," If we are able to break through this white bar that you see, the price target above is $3.92 "
"12490530","12496330",".61. Way up here. "
"12501210","12503190"," I'm going to draw another price target."
"12505370","12507910"," $3.92.61 price target."
"12511680","12513660"," I don't know if we get it the next hour. "
"12513740","12515220"," It should take an hour to get there right here."
"12518740","12529060"," $3.82.61. Right"
"12529060","12529340"," there."
"12530040","12530820"," It might take all day. "
"12531980","12532700"," Not all day."
"12532800","12533380"," It should take an hour."
"12542710","12543730"," There it is right there. "
"12557840","12560220"," If you're bearable, I don't care."
"12560360","12564440"," Why is XLU not catching a bid?"
"12564940","12566440"," Why is XLF catching a bid?"
"12570140","12572780"," That's not what you want to see if we're rolling over."
"12575200","12591130"," That's definitely means something to bulls right"
"12593980","12599820"," now. "
"12599820","12603940"," I said I wouldn't short XLF right now and they poked me the moment the trade went their way."
"12609060","12611840"," Jesus Christ, I'm salivating with spy daily charge this moment."
"12612520","12613640"," I'm back for shoveling snow. "
"12613880","12614320"," Right on Grubster."
"12614480","12614860"," How are you doing, man?"
"12614960","12615600"," How are your kids doing?"
"12619320","12620660"," Grubster, I got something for you."
"12621600","12622720"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"12623940","12625260"," We got some support now."
"12625440","12626640"," Hey, we're going to go higher here."
"12627460","12629580"," We're breaking through the five-minute trigger. "
"12634900","12635980"," We've got a previous."
"12636480","12638580"," We've just heads up here so you can see this."
"12639000","12640840"," I'm going to get rid of book map for the moment. "
"12641320","12646240"," What we want you to look at is I'm going to scrunch this up."
"12648180","12649820"," Just remember this back here, okay?"
"12652960","12654480"," High of the day is behind here."
"12656520","12658840"," Look at the orange bars above on book map. "
"12658840","12667910"," The sellers are weak."
"12669430","12671070"," Squeezing higher to the gap now."
"12677610","12678830"," Oh, yeah. "
"12684200","12695990"," 3D9Cs are now printing 200% there at $1.40. I'm"
"12695990","12696510"," not in them."
"12698810","12700790"," $1.47 right now."
"12708190","12710430"," Now trading the challenge the high of the day. "
"12722620","12724900"," Yup, buyers overtaking sellers right now."
"12725160","12725740"," You got to see that?"
"12726140","12727300"," Thanks for the heads up on that."
"12731380","12739940"," Gaps being closed right now. "
"12744040","12745000"," Tag 39056."
"12745480","12746560"," Look for a small pullback."
"12747900","12775900"," Close the rest of the gap above at $3.982. You"
"12775900","12776820"," guys are fucking hilarious. "
"12777980","12783440"," Close the rest of that gap above $3.98. Broke through."
"12783660","12784540"," Just another note too."
"12784660","12785980"," We just broke previous high. "
"12786120","12787060"," We have a new high on the day."
"12789520","12792180"," We're going to look on a five- and fifteen-minute chart real quick."
"12794000","12796800"," You can take the money and run and re-enter the trade here. "
"12798660","12800660"," We're breaking above in the five-minute here."
"12800860","12801280"," Very bush."
"12802740","12803460"," Fifteen minute. "
"12806140","12807280"," Way up here."
"12807520","12812720"," $3.94.91. Just closing the gap right here in the overnight."
"12813900","12816820"," This yellow bar right here is the closing price, right?"
"12817660","12822620"," This yellow bar is where you trap bulls trying to buy a dip. "
"12833680","12835140"," Smart money's down here."
"12856930","12859890"," I'm going to try to turn this into support right here."
"12860250","12863570"," You can see this previous high. "
"12864250","12865770"," I'm going to try to turn that into support."
"12867310","12876430"," We have more gap above now."
"12886020","12887420"," That was a blast, wasn't it?"
"12895800","12898460"," Yeah, if you can, try to close spreads on a rip too. "
"12898720","12899380"," That's the other thing."
"12899680","12907340"," If you don't put a limit sell-in previously, so it triggers automatically, you might need to hand"
"12907340","12908260"," sell them on a rip."
"12909480","12910760"," Specifically credit spreads. "
"12911120","12911860"," Credit spreads, man."
"12912480","12915080"," When the market's moving, your credit spreads move."
"12921640","12923660"," You guys want me to check Tesla for you?"
"12924020","12925120"," You guys ready for Tesla?"
"12927100","12928660"," We're in a small pullback here. "
"12929060","12931220"," We want to see this white line right here."
"12931220","12932340"," We want to make this support."
"12936510","12938570"," We want to see this hold right here. "
"12942500","12944440"," And we'll try to attack above here."
"12946420","12952660"," We got some volatility here, volatility here, price target above, 392.61 for the day."
"12955080","12958640"," Do you see the orange bar right by the below my screen here?"
"12958760","12959880"," That's the target. "
"12972680","12974660"," I'll look at Tesla right now for you."
"12978320","12982100"," Tesla could consolidate and get extremely bullish here, okay?"
"12983780","12993320"," If you guys are Tesla traders, see this nice move right here?"
"12993740","12994220"," Oh, wait a minute."
"12994420","12995200"," We need to put that. "
"13004910","13006750"," I want you to see this on Tesla."
"13011720","13014020"," This is where the sell-off was on Tesla here."
"13018020","13019520"," Pushed up, sold back down. "
"13019780","13021080"," Pushed up, sold back down."
"13021420","13021840"," Pushed up."
"13021840","13026780"," If you can get these, see this is the one, the five. "
"13027060","13028020"," I believe this is the 15."
"13028700","13030200"," And this is the hourly right here."
"13031000","13033320"," Price target above, retest of 135. "
"13035360","13039340"," On deck right now for the bulls for Tesla."
"13041200","13043800"," You've got some volatility here at 130."
"13045020","13046680"," You've got some volatility. "
"13052310","13055350"," 131.23. And right there, there's your sellers."
"13055790","13058190"," 134.87 for an exact number on Tesla."
"13061050","13062630"," It might take a few minutes. "
"13062850","13069170"," You could see Tesla, or you could see Tesla come down and consolidate at 127 for a move higher."
"13074100","13075860"," This is bullish so far."
"13076440","13080120"," I'll tell you what you don't want to give up is you don't want to give up 127. "
"13080780","13089400"," Sorry, you don't want to give up 126.75. Do not want to give it up if you're a Tesla"
"13089400","13089700"," bull."
"13098900","13100060"," You want me to do it on Tesla?"
"13106820","13112860"," Oh yeah, so when your children are older and they get in, they change age groups."
"13115220","13117840"," My oldest is, it's weird. "
"13117840","13124640"," My nine-year-old, so my nine-year-old is just becoming prepuse pubescent."
"13124960","13128640"," And so I can't just run up to her and give her a big old hug whenever I want anymore."
"13128880","13130320"," She's like, oh, daddy, stop hugging me. "
"13131340","13132660"," So she's my youngest."
"13133320","13134240"," I'm kind of sad."
"13136500","13141000"," It's like breaking my heart that she's becoming a very, very young teenager. "
"13141840","13150500"," And then my oldest is going through her beginnings of her PSAT studying and stuff."
"13150720","13156960"," And I was thinking about you because the children one day will be gone out of your life, right?"
"13157080","13158740"," They'll be off with their friends, they'll be off of college."
"13160400","13165160"," And I was thinking about you because last night we had to go to the library. "
"13165950","13171000"," We went to the library because we took a practice PSAT test."
"13172600","13174820"," And we're like, oh, we gotta work on some stuff."
"13175020","13181240"," And so we're picking out all these books on subjects that I haven't read in years or thought about"
"13181240","13189820"," in years, like about philosophy and Greek philosophy and American democracy"
"13189820","13194840"," or the birth of American democracy, not quite no political party shit. "
"13196320","13200280"," So that she can think for herself rather than having a political party tell her what she wants to"
"13200280","13203880"," be, philosophically in their life."
"13204120","13209960"," And then, of course, we're going through legends and fables and just a bunch of crap."
"13210160","13213860"," And I was thinking about you because you've got, I remember you were saying you were awake at 4 a "
"13213860","13217760",".m. the other day and just the journey of being a dad or a father. "
"13218900","13219580"," It's kind of a cool thing."
"13219580","13236480"," A little flip,"
"13236600","13237920"," long-day scalp in progress, right?"
"13241260","13245960"," Yeah, price targets still above for the day, 392.61 on an intraday, at least."
"13247560","13252120"," You guys want to see the intraday target for spies just so you guys can verify with me. "
"13255620","13257900"," But there are some conditions here, right?"
"13260860","13262520"," So I want you to see this on the spy."
"13264060","13265600"," There are conditions on this."
"13266600","13268800"," So we fought above in the one in the five minute. "
"13269760","13270280"," Okay."
"13271540","13273640"," And what we need to do is hold."
"13274020","13279360"," You need to hold currently, uh, 38967 and 38894. "
"13279820","13283360"," And to be truthful, you really want to hold."
"13284720","13285960"," You really want to hold."
"13286760","13288160"," You need to be bullish here. "
"13288400","13290140"," You really want to hold 3967."
"13291340","13294580"," If you can hold 3967, see this green line that's coming down."
"13295160","13296480"," That's 39260. "
"13296800","13300180"," Depending on the time it takes to get here, this number will change."
"13300480","13307440"," But 392 currently it sits at 392, uh, 39260."
"13308280","13311160"," So the time will change out here for a minute. "
"13312740","13313420"," Right here."
"13313480","13315180"," See that 39261 right here?"
"13316060","13317600"," Uh, that's what I'm looking for, right?"
"13317860","13324570"," I'm looking for, I'm looking for this old for continuation up here."
"13327180","13330080"," So I want this, this is going to show you if we have the velocity. "
"13331780","13336860"," Or the momentum to break that gap, break this previous low and eventually make our way up."
"13337440","13343120"," Now if we start to fail that one minute, fail to five minute, uh, we'll lose, we'll, we'll actually"
"13343120","13345220"," lose, lose this, um, support here."
"13346740","13354140"," And so what I'll look at, so 38967388, um, 3899. "
"13355140","13357060"," We'll do another, uh, EMA here."
"13358620","13359720"," This is going to be exact."
"13360040","13360200"," Okay. "
"13361500","13362700"," Uh, wait a minute."
"13363820","13365140"," We'll do EMA2."
"13366640","13367720"," This isn't exact. "
"13367980","13374490"," It's not an EMA, so, uh, 3892."
"13381400","13382480"," No, 3889."
"13388080","13388980"," Hold on here. "
"13414780","13417460"," We'll, we'll turn off the MA for right now."
"13418780","13420820"," You don't want to lose this green line right here."
"13420820","13424500"," And you really don't want to lose this, this blue line right here. "
"13424620","13424740"," Okay."
"13425460","13425920"," So that's cool."
"13426060","13428360"," We'll, we'll, we'll do run with this right now in this chart. "
"13429100","13430920"," Cause not an estimated moving average."
"13431520","13436920"," Uh, but the closest thing I can get for an estimated moving average for it to work for you guys."
"13449620","13450060"," Yeah. "
"13450180","13451260"," Most evil thing right now."
"13451480","13452760"," Don't close the cap above."
"13453280","13454760"," I agree with that CSM jazz. "
"13454760","13465160"," I don't"
"13465160","13466780"," use these indicators."
"13467240","13469900"," I use a predictive model."
"13471340","13474200"," An algorithm. "
"13485100","13485500"," Yeah."
"13485980","13487320"," So my oldest is 15."
"13487320","13489900"," And I'm like. "
"13493500","13494680"," I'm going to buy some calls here."
"13494740","13495000"," Hold on."
"13521740","13522100"," Okay. "
"13526200","13530760"," So I was talking to someone else last night or I was talking to Chaz, I think, and I was"
"13530760","13534760"," like, I was like, she's, she's just becoming teenager with friends."
"13534760","13541240"," I'm like, I was talking about my iPhone and he's like, what version is it?"
"13541360","13544020"," I go, I don't know because what do you mean you don't know?"
"13545200","13550740"," And I go, well, I was like, I bought my daughter the newest iPhone or I bought the newest iPhone"
"13550740","13552060"," and then I gave it to my daughter."
"13552900","13555100"," I exchanged it with her for her old iPhone. "
"13555620","13556500"," You know, it's funny about it."
"13558080","13561560"," Um, so this is what's inside the iPhone."
"13561560","13563960"," It's like a picture of a boy band. "
"13566080","13567820"," So I use her old iPhone."
"13570180","13573980"," And she's got the nice iPhone because teenage girls can be really mean to each other."
"13582150","13598100"," And, uh, oh"
"13601080","13601820"," yeah, definitely. "
"13604920","13607500"," So, you know, kids hate each other and stuff."
"13607500","13611240"," So, and then of course we're talking about, uh, got our iPhone or an iWatch too."
"13611900","13614740"," And of course, I'm like, I'm like kicking a can down the street. "
"13615220","13618640"," And so, you know, as the kids get older, they don't really care when they're younger, but they get"
"13618640","13619040"," older."
"13620060","13623620"," Uh, you just want to make sure that, um, you know, they get nice things and stuff."
"13625240","13626780"," I gotta, I have to talk about something. "
"13629040","13633640"," Um, they need to talk about something in here, okay?"
"13637420","13638940"," How many people get in here right now, 211?"
"13642800","13645960"," Uh, you do, you do, I'm just listening to my own thing right now."
"13646160","13647360"," Oh, well, my wife has a sister."
"13647700","13648960"," She's 15 already dating already. "
"13649740","13650780"," Whole family is freaking out."
"13653400","13654760"," Check out some Alan Watts."
"13655480","13655920"," All right. "
"13656820","13657220"," Alan Watts."
"13657940","13658540"," I will check it out."
"13659300","13659720"," I wrote it down. "
"13661820","13662360"," It's philosophy."
"13662900","13663180"," Right on."
"13663780","13663800"," Right. "
"13663960","13667240"," I read, I read philosophy when I was young, but I just haven't in so many years."
"13668460","13668780"," Okay."
"13668900","13670540"," So, I want to talk about something in the stream right now. "
"13670780","13671740"," We've got a little bit of a minute here."
"13671940","13674120"," I'm long right now in calls, just seeing if you don't know this."
"13674260","13676680"," I'm long in calls, uh, for move higher. "
"13678340","13681840"," Uh, I'll probably add some on the screen line down here."
"13681920","13686080"," If we, if we don't get above, if we start to lose the one minute, I'll probably add some down"
"13686080","13686320"," below."
"13687480","13689040"," Uh, for move higher than the end of the day. "
"13689680","13691440"," Now, we have to talk about something right now."
"13692060","13693580"," I need to be serious about this, okay?"
"13693980","13695360"," It's an important thing to be talking about."
"13698760","13699900"," I just, hold on a second. "
"13704520","13705780"," Maybe one second here."
"13713200","13714300"," I want to talk about something."
"13714300","13722260"," Um, uh, you mark this, mark this on the time somewhere. "
"13724700","13726800"," It was an important thing we're going to talk about right here."
"13726900","13727000"," Okay."
"13727240","13728640"," We'll talk about this too frequently. "
"13729800","13730240"," Okay."
"13730380","13732100"," Hit that like button, you freeloading commies."
"13732960","13734160"," So we're going to talk about something. "
"13736860","13742700"," I don't really, I don't ever like to talk about this stuff because it can come off as this specific"
"13742700","13743140"," thing."
"13743140","13745600"," I don't ever try to talk about this."
"13746420","13751720"," Um, but I need to talk about it every once in a while. "
"13753820","13758160"," Uh, and let me start with the beginnings of this or how, what happened?"
"13758680","13758940"," What happened?"
"13759040","13759260"," What happened?"
"13759520","13761240"," I didn't notice part of this until just now."
"13761440","13764420"," I just got a text message from a friend of mine."
"13765240","13765820"," A few moments ago. "
"13765980","13766940"," I just got a text message."
"13767980","13772380"," So I just read something from the discord that I wasn't aware of."
"13772380","13775460"," Uh, but last night. "
"13776520","13780000"," It was a nine 30 10 30 11 o'clock or something."
"13780540","13785920"," And, uh, I saw a tweet from somebody from, uh, H as."
"13786420","13793360"," And he had posted a clip of a video of me on a live stream to you or to Twitter. "
"13795360","13797380"," And, uh, he posted it."
"13797380","13802620"," He got some traction and then, uh, he called me on the phone and we were talking about the video."
"13804580","13810820"," And he said, uh, he was trying to coax out of me something about that I caught grief yesterday on"
"13810820","13811100"," Twitter. "
"13813260","13816680"," Uh, and he asked me, are you going to respond to any of those people?"
"13817660","13822380"," And I will, my first and my initial thing was I didn't, I wasn't aware that I caught grief on"
"13822380","13823080"," Twitter yesterday."
"13823080","13830360"," Uh, but secondly, uh, that I probably wouldn't respond, uh, but not due to not wanting to respond."
"13830420","13834100"," Most of the reason that I don't respond to people on Twitter is because I don't have the time. "
"13834580","13842040"," Uh, if I post on Twitter, I'm live streaming, uh, make phone calls, make posts on that captain's"
"13842040","13842220"," alpha."
"13842700","13847420"," If I go back into my, into the background of Twitter, my notifications all day"
"13847420","13853060"," long."
"13853060","13857480"," Like 30 DMs a day, hundreds of notifications. "
"13858480","13863920"," And in those notifications, there are comments, there are questions, there are conversations that I"
"13863920","13867000"," try to have with people or even then just previous posts."
"13867400","13869780"," I'm hundreds, maybe, maybe a thousand a day, some days."
"13870500","13878840"," So it's difficult on its own for me to respond to people, um, or to, uh, explain myself or anything"
"13878840","13879400"," like that. "
"13879400","13882340"," Uh, you guys have me here at a live stream."
"13882420","13884140"," You guys know how I trade every day."
"13884360","13885820"," You know what, it's on the tape, right?"
"13887120","13888060"," Uh, how I trade. "
"13888700","13892020"," You guys know that you don't ever get anything from me in the past."
"13892620","13897940"," You'll never see me come on to Twitter any ever and be like, yeah, I nailed it."
"13899100","13899540"," Right?"
"13899880","13904200"," You guys will never ever, you know what I don't do, what that people do on Twitter?"
"13905020","13908100"," They'll, uh, paper trade a trade in both directions. "
"13909160","13914020"," They'll take a screenshot of the winner and then they'll post that to Twitter after the fact."
"13914800","13917640"," And say, look, I made $10,000 in this trade today."
"13918040","13918880"," And that's all they post. "
"13919840","13920700"," Only wins."
"13922780","13923260"," Right?"
"13923440","13924660"," That's all they do is just wins."
"13926240","13926720"," Right?"
"13927020","13929260"," And, and you'll never lose, right?"
"13929900","13936120"," Um, you'll get that on, on Twitter in general. "
"13936380","13939400"," But my point though is I don't always get a chance to come on Twitter."
"13939660","13944440"," I do try once every three days or so or at least every week and scroll through my notifications and"
"13944440","13945520"," try to catch up with people."
"13945520","13950020"," If people disagree or pissed off or they want to make fun of me and whatever, I'm fine with that. "
"13950100","13951140"," I'm fine with trolling too."
"13951300","13952440"," Like I'm fine with if you troll me."
"13953400","13954640"," I was not saying good fun or whatever. "
"13956200","13957780"," And there's another aspect to this."
"13957780","13963160"," Uh, I don't have a ton of followers, but once you hit like 10,000, you have like a dedicated,"
"13963220","13966300"," you have a dedicated group of trolls."
"13967720","13970100"," Uh, you'll piss people off if you made the right call. "
"13970580","13972820"," And if you make a wrong call, they'll come out and troll you."
"13973140","13973960"," They'll troll you if you're right."
"13975240","13976980"," Anything that they can find, they'll troll you. "
"13977780","13981100"," Uh, so there's the other aspect of it is you don't respond to people."
"13981680","13982040"," Right?"
"13983020","13985580"," Now it still hurts your feelings, right?"
"13985740","13989740"," When you get trolled or someone says something mean, especially when you do shit for free,"
"13989740","13994420"," especially when you dedicate your time for free, your money for free."
"13995340","13999000"," Uh, and what it costs to put information out the shit that I have to buy in the background. "
"13999140","14000460"," That can be hurtful."
"14000880","14004580"," It actually makes someone like me want to charge money."
"14005260","14010100"," Uh, because then I know that you're here because you want to be here, right?"
"14010100","14016440"," So if I charge you money, even if it's only 10 bucks a month or something, I know that you"
"14016440","14017000"," want to be here. "
"14017520","14021720"," If I, I know that there are discords out there that charge a hundred fucking dollars to be in"
"14021720","14021900"," there."
"14022140","14024880"," Two hundred dollars, three hundred dollars to be in a discord."
"14025960","14030420"," And what it does is it weeds out the fuck, the fakers, the trolls, the bullshitters. "
"14031300","14033620"," I don't, I'm not talking about, you don't know how to trade."
"14033800","14038180"," If you don't know how to trade and you're paying money to be in a discord, uh, to learn something"
"14038180","14039140"," or to get some alpha."
"14039420","14043740"," And I know for a fucking fact that our, our discord, you can make up, you can be a fucking"
"14043740","14044500"," millionaire in there. "
"14044600","14049500"," There's guys, there's guys in there that break their dicks day in and day out in that discord."
"14050680","14056940"," Um, you got guys that are in the stream right now, uh, that break their dicks in that discord."
"14057160","14059540"," Jason Hendricks breaks his dick in that discord. "
"14059840","14062280"," Your wife's boyfriend breaks his dick in that discord."
"14062280","14067260"," Uh, you got a winky in there breaking his dick in that discord, right?"
"14067780","14069320"," So you got people in there that really care."
"14069500","14071260"," You got people in there who spend their time in there. "
"14071320","14072500"," They try to create a community."
"14072900","14074120"," They take their shit seriously."
"14074840","14079240"," So, so if you're just in there fucking around or dicking around, right, maybe you have to make it"
"14079240","14082120"," so that you care about being there. "
"14082920","14088980"," Now the, now circling back to, uh, circling back to you guys know my life, right?"
"14088980","14091760"," You know trades I'm taking, you know when I'm closing them."
"14091940","14094920"," You guys know when I make a good trade and a bad trade, you see it all."
"14096120","14100440"," Uh, so if you're going to be, if you troll somebody in a nice way, it's different. "
"14100680","14105000"," If you're like, if you're like, hey man, uh, I saw that bad trade."
"14105300","14107960"," Hope you're able to recover, you know, something like that."
"14109820","14111460"," You know, I hope you didn't lose your ass in there. "
"14111540","14112560"," Hope you're able to make your money back."
"14112680","14115840"," And then if he's come down at that point, then you come back and troll his ass."
"14115840","14118660"," As a friend, it's different. "
"14119960","14123560"," And then just being a fucking full on cocksucker specifically to one person."
"14124380","14126180"," So just for us and our group, right?"
"14126540","14132640"," You guys and me, people on discord and me, people that you're from friends with you on Twitter, fin"
"14132640","14133640"," twit and all that shit."
"14134380","14140800"," I was really grateful last night to Chas for going out there and, uh, and, and, um, trying to show"
"14140800","14141900"," the actual tape, right?"
"14142320","14145280"," And it made me feel really good that someone out there and did that for me. "
"14145440","14149520"," The only reason I wasn't on Twitter yesterday is because I'm fucking like, I was up at three 30 in"
"14149520","14149740"," the morning."
"14149840","14152540"," I was live streamed all day long, you know, I've been kids."
"14153180","14154320"," And then I talked to people. "
"14154320","14159420"," I spoke, spent time yesterday on the phone with James Rowan, Joe Donut."
"14160060","14166700"," Uh, uh, uh, with, uh, goddamn E trading shorts, right?"
"14167060","14167960"," Chas, bunch of people."
"14168220","14169680"," These are all like people that I care about. "
"14169680","14174700"," I care about any, there are people in this chat right now that have DM'd me."
"14175780","14181820"," And I fucking stepped out of my day after a long ass day sat on the phone with them for"
"14181820","14184100"," two hours, three hours trying to help them out."
"14184420","14185800"," Or just have a conversation. "
"14186840","14187940"," Hey, I got smoked this week."
"14188060","14192140"," You want to talk and I spent time talking to those people because I care about them when they're"
"14192140","14194340"," when they're losing mostly like you want to talk to me."
"14194680","14196060"," I'm gonna call you on the phone when you're winning. "
"14196620","14198020"," I'll fucking call you when you're losing."
"14198640","14201460"," You know, and so I'm reading the tweet or I'm not a tweet."
"14201540","14203140"," I'm reading a discord here, right?"
"14203700","14205020"," And I don't know the full context. "
"14206060","14211080"," But you got a guy like Winky inside our fucking discord doing his best."
"14211840","14213480"," I fucking trust this guy."
"14213960","14218120"," This fucking guy makes calls on chat in, in YouTube. "
"14218640","14219620"," Now we don't always get along."
"14220380","14221720"," Winky and I don't always get along."
"14222420","14223520"," He doesn't always like me. "
"14223780","14224740"," And I don't always like Winky."
"14225820","14225880"," Right?"
"14225880","14229280"," But Winky breaks his dick day in day out on his chat."
"14229560","14231320"," He shows up to YouTube every fucking day. "
"14231800","14236120"," He shows up to discord, makes a room in there, and tries to help other traders out."
"14236280","14239640"," New traders tries to bounce shit off of successful traders."
"14240740","14245320"," You know, it's okay to break someone's dick, but not when they're so sore about it or sensitive at"
"14245320","14245760"," that moment. "
"14246060","14246780"," Especially our group."
"14247220","14249980"," I don't give a fine fuck about some guy on Fintuit that I don't know."
"14250300","14252040"," Like some guy on Fintuit that I don't know. "
"14252040","14257400"," Some guy on Twitter with like two followers and I've never interacted with him on a stream or in a"
"14257400","14259420"," discord or in a fucking YouTube video."
"14259420","14260140"," Fuck that guy."
"14260160","14260940"," I'll never respond to him. "
"14261160","14263720"," But you guys and me, we're like a family."
"14265020","14266940"," So you guys should be treating each other well."
"14267060","14270940"," And if you see somebody that you guys don't know out there fucking with somebody, you should say"
"14270940","14271340"," something. "
"14272100","14273860"," Do you understand what I'm saying?"
"14274120","14275260"," Because all this shit's free."
"14275540","14280300"," I mean, it blows my mind."
"14280300","14284460"," You know, I just saw a discord tweet where Winky has to try to defend himself. "
"14284840","14286580"," He doesn't fucking know anybody."
"14287660","14288100"," Nothing."
"14288940","14291460"," And if anybody's breaking his balls, get fucked. "
"14291680","14295220"," I'd rather have Jason Hendrix, Winky, your wife's boyfriend, Joe Donut."
"14295580","14297560"," Pull a bunch of you I know in this in this feed."
"14297980","14298480"," I love Avery. "
"14299160","14299980"," I can name Muff, right?"
"14300280","14301800"," Guys are here every single day."
"14302420","14303860"," Nick, Nick ass, each trading shorts."
"14304820","14305980"," The list goes on. "
"14306280","14309580"," Dylan, John Haggerty shows up here every day and drops stuff."
"14309580","14311780"," Joe Nutella shows up, drops up."
"14312060","14312380"," Chase. "
"14313320","14316160"," Chase has been showing up since the first live stream."
"14317540","14319620"," I'll protect that guy day in and day out."
"14321460","14322220"," You know what I mean?"
"14322440","14324240"," So you guys need to protect each other out there. "
"14324640","14326120"," I don't know how else to say it to you."
"14326700","14328620"," It's important for you to be doing that."
"14329020","14332640"," And you can break each other's balls, but there's a time and a place to break each other's balls. "
"14333280","14336960"," Now when they're out there breaking my balls on Twitter, it's just that I'm not on there to see it"
"14336960","14337500"," at that moment."
"14337500","14339440"," But if I had seen it, I'd be upset."
"14339700","14340220"," I'd be hurt inside. "
"14340620","14346240"," I'd be fucking devastated if I'm getting my balls broken on a serious way from people on fint to"
"14346240","14346360"," it."
"14346520","14352640"," So the moral of the story is you can break each other's balls, right, when it's appropriate."
"14354180","14356800"," And when it's not appropriate, you should be taking care of each other out there. "
"14357760","14362300"," And if it gets too fucking wild inside the discord at some point, I'm going to put the fucking"
"14362300","14363040"," bandhammer down."
"14363240","14365140"," Not the bandhammer, but I'll just I'll fucking charge."
"14365660","14366500"," How do you know what I'll do?"
"14367020","14369420"," I'll keep all the OGs in there for free for life. "
"14371240","14374040"," And I'll charge any of the scrubs trying to come in there and fuck around."
"14374600","14375440"," So that'll be the end of it."
"14376960","14379620"," And I'll fucking give that money to the guys that are in there. "
"14379780","14380140"," Do you know what I mean?"
"14380400","14382100"," So you guys don't be fucking around the discord."
"14384480","14385400"," Does that work?"
"14386600","14388240"," Is that good enough to piss anybody off?"
"14388760","14391980"," If I piss anybody off that wants to quit the discord now, get the fuck out."
"14403510","14404390"," Nothing happened. "
"14408790","14409590"," You guys understand?"
"14410750","14415050"," You guys have to understand because there's a I'll tell you what, there's 400 fucking million"
"14415050","14415910"," people in the US."
"14416570","14418650"," Traders around the world, there's millions of them."
"14419090","14420510"," We'll just find we don't need. "
"14420710","14423810"," I don't need 3,000 people that all hate each other."
"14423890","14427270"," We had just a hundred or 10 or 15 I'm fine with that."
"14427270","14428110"," We have a hundred. "
"14428470","14429530"," I'm fine with that."
"14430030","14430790"," You know what I mean?"
"14436040","14437420"," Yeah, you were boyfriend, man."
"14437580","14438260"," I thought I brought him up. "
"14438620","14440260"," I swear I named him a few times."
"14443840","14445540"," Yeah, no, discord seems good."
"14447160","14453560"," I saw this discord post in here and he should never have to defend himself. "
"14464110","14470450"," Yeah, if we can make a bad call or I make a bad call or Jason makes a bad call"
"14470450","14476610"," or fucking Dylan makes a bad call or Chase makes a bad call or John Haggerty makes a bad call."
"14476610","14477290"," I don't give a fuck."
"14477470","14479830"," Dude, I want these guys here every day day and day out. "
"14480550","14483050"," It's like gold having people like that around us."
"14483910","14484870"," It's like diamonds."
"14486150","14487670"," You can't pay for that shit. "
"14487670","14490350"," There's like, I've paid alpha guys."
"14490530","14494950"," I've paid guys $600 a month and they show up for an hour once a week."
"14495490","14496010"," An hour. "
"14497710","14501890"," And you might be in a position at a crucial moment in the market yesterday."
"14502410","14505690"," Markets fucking getting torched yesterday and you paying an alpha."
"14505990","14507430"," They're like 600 bucks or something stupid. "
"14507630","14508410"," They don't even show up."
"14509010","14511410"," They're like, nope, I'm scheduled for Friday at three o'clock."
"14512170","14513770"," I'm scheduled at one PM on a Friday. "
"14514130","14514450"," Shit, you're not."
"14514730","14515070"," That's real."
"14516190","14518690"," So like, you know, I don't know what to say on that subject anymore. "
"14518810","14520310"," I'm going to stop talking about that shit."
"14521110","14521830"," Have a smile."
"14522690","14523490"," Have a bear. "
"14523690","14524050"," Have a whiskey."

"14556040","14557300"," You attract people. "
"14558660","14564000"," You defend your friends out in fin Twitter and you're going to attract more friends."
"14566440","14568560"," Especially if they usually make good calls."
"14568800","14569740"," I'm like a guy like Winky dude. "
"14570000","14571440"," He's making great calls all the time."
"14573480","14576080"," You can tell who you can tell who the good traders are."
"14577200","14578360"," Maybe friends with those guys. "
"14578680","14583560"," Why would you not want to be friends with somebody that that's a good trader and get and learn"
"14583560","14584400"," something from them."
"14584460","14586640"," Just say, hey, man, he teach me how you do this."
"14586740","14587060"," Hey, man. "
"14587720","14592420"," That doesn't mean you have to like trade like them or be them, but you know, like, or even even"
"14592420","14593220"," just back testing."
"14593600","14595320"," Hey, look, I'm thinking about doing this."
"14595460","14596180"," What do you think of that?"
"14597380","14597440"," Right?"
"14598320","14599200"," Why are you doing this?"
"14599200","14600700"," Or this is why I'm doing this. "
"14600980","14604400"," Do I have anything fucked up in the mechanics of my trade here?"
"14605040","14607420"," What are the pitfalls of my trade right here?"
"14607680","14610120"," Where are my losses that I don't see in my trade?"
"14611000","14612700"," How do I hedge my trade?"
"14613900","14614660"," You know what I mean?"
"14615060","14616120"," Who are you going to ask?"
"14616240","14621780"," I don't ask that shit of all day long, Jason Hendricks, wife's boyfriend, Winky, John Hagerty."
"14624240","14624740"," You probably got 200."
"14624740","14627920"," Right now it says 200 people here, but I'm back in my machine. "
"14628060","14629100"," I got a thousand people watching."
"14629580","14631800"," So I know the regulars in this chat."
"14632340","14638060"," There's at least 30 to 50 regulars in this chat that are that are active traders. "
"14638820","14642740"," And I would all day long trust their trust their, their ideas."
"14650350","14656110"," No, no, don't make don't make it caps Navy because I'm going to be taking the focus off me soon."
"14656110","14656850"," Very soon. "

"14683910","14686350"," to fuck around fucking kick them out."
"14686350","14688170"," This is some serious shit. "
"14688290","14688770"," This is real money."
"14689030","14692650"," So, um, people take this shit very seriously."
"14693870","14697630"," We have a good time, but we take what we're doing serious is our profession. "
"14700370","14701730"," That's what I'm here for, right?"
"14702110","14703110"," This is what you're here for."
"14703730","14706230"," We're here to make money here to have a profession here."

"14718270","14721730"," Have a reason why you're trying to be in this market."
"14722630","14727570"," You know, and, uh, the only person you're trying to take money from is a bank. "
"14729430","14730030"," That's it."
"14735830","14737250"," No of you too, Ben Godfrey."
"14740690","14741330"," Thanks, really. "
"14748080","14748960"," By that gas."
"14749360","14750060"," I haven't looked at that."
"14750180","14751240"," They looked at it this morning. "
"14752160","14753540"," Uh, for a brief moment."
"14754180","14755680"," Oh, XLF is pumping."
"14757620","14760380"," Hey, everybody's everybody's been talking about that gas for like three days. "
"14762840","14764920"," That means the pains here in that gas, huh?"
"14765120","14767060"," Ten bucks on that gas."
"14767480","14769360"," That's a steal."
"14772020","14773680"," So where's the real pain on that gas?"
"14773680","14775460"," Eight dollars and 22 cents. "
"14778400","14779740"," Nine dollars and four cents."
"14779940","14780940"," You want me to look at that gas?"
"14783780","14784840"," I'm still long here."
"14784940","14785620"," By the way, I haven't gotten. "
"14785960","14790160"," I'm I've been long for half an hour since 1035."
"14795670","14797770"," 390 is now trading 75 cents."
"14799870","14800790"," Oh, yeah, baby. "
"14801010","14801270"," It's pumping."

"14822710","14824430"," There's some definite OGs around here."
"14825610","14831230"," There's some definite OGs around here. "
"14835700","14836720"," Oh, thanks, legend."
"14839040","14839900"," Boyle's killing you."
"14843820","14845020"," Jay Sharp's baby. "
"14847040","14847940"," Love you too."
"14853710","14855310"," Yeah, just some guys been here."
"14855610","14857010"," You don't have to be the best trader either. "
"14857770","14861650"," There's a whole class of people here that don't talk whole class of people that show up and just"
"14861650","14862190"," join the chat."
"14862190","14864230"," There's people that just just fill up."
"14864630","14868250"," Like there's some legit people here that I'm not even naming right now. "
"14868610","14872370"," Like you don't have to be you don't have to be like the guy that's always posting stuff either."
"14872510","14875630"," There's just a community that people do different things here."
"14881360","14882620"," Yeah, John Haggerty, man. "
"14885860","14886560"," Kid time."
"14886940","14888480"," Yeah, I'm long from down here."
"14888560","14888980"," I got long. "
"14889620","14890980"," I got long right here."
"14890980","14891100"," We're right here."
"14891320","14892220"," I got long. "
"14893600","14894720"," Went down a little bit."
"14896280","14900340"," I'm looking to close this gap above a 390 60 390 80."
"14900660","14904300"," I'd really like to see some continuation up this price target at 390 261. "
"14905100","14906420"," Even if it takes the end of day."
"14907760","14909360"," So it's 216, right?"
"14909580","14910580"," We've got 14 minutes."
"14910820","14913200"," So what you guys know, you probably have 14 minutes left in this trade. "
"14914020","14914340"," At most."
"14918720","14922100"," We don't want to see what it's like, you know, it's 216 in the afternoon."
"14922120","14923220"," You know what happens here, right?"
"14923400","14923880"," We come up here. "
"14924080","14924900"," We come up here."
"14925000","14925320"," We reject."
"14925860","14929980"," We start to do this bullshit rollover and then we hit the high at the end of the day. "
"14930940","14932580"," So I might close this out soon."
"14932580","14934740"," I really like to see this gap get closed."
"14935440","14937220"," I really want to see this happen right here. "
"14937440","14938280"," I want to see at least this."
"14939100","14940520"," Maybe we do this kind of nonsense."
"14940900","14942260"," Then we come up here and hit it at the end of the day. "
"14942360","14943120"," That's what I'm looking for."
"14943740","14944680"," Something like that."
"14946480","14948000"," So we'll see if we can get it right now. "
"14961290","14964170"," I'm going to check out the trigger right now and see if this is it."
"14964350","14965410"," This is still valid or not."
"14965870","14966270"," Hold on. "
"14978820","14979720"," Give me a second here."
"14984950","14985270"," 3982."
"14987670","14988650"," Yeah, so right in here. "
"14988910","14989110"," Hold on."
"14990470","14998050"," We'll know if this trade is still valid or not."
"14998050","14998390"," Everybody. "
"15002010","15003370"," Right where that blue line is."
"15005110","15006350"," Let's get rid of this white bar."
"15006590","15007410"," See this blue line right here?"
"15007630","15009690"," If we stay on this blue line, the trade is still valid. "
"15015330","15017030"," I want to close this gap right here."
"15021460","15024160"," I'll be careful up here because you get that middle of the afternoon."
"15024300","15024860"," We're taking a break. "
"15025120","15025700"," Not always."
"15026020","15028740"," Sometimes we'll do it early in the late afternoon, like two to three o'clock."
"15029400","15032880"," But for me, I'd like to just see us close this gap above right here. "
"15034020","15035160"," Maybe we take a break."
"15036280","15038180"," A little bit of something like this."
"15039120","15041220"," Quick blast through and then we move up into the close. "
"15041620","15043240"," That's some hope we get something like that."
"15044820","15045800"," We can go higher."
"15046040","15048140"," We can go up here to the gap and start running it up. "
"15048140","15049500"," And then we just bleed off into the bell."
"15050320","15052020"," But this is what I'm looking for right in here."
"15096340","15097500"," What's the way from where we're saying?"
"15098340","15100180"," How about you could further follow up like a band?"
"15100920","15101280"," Yeah. "
"15101340","15101420"," Yeah."
"15102280","15103540"," Don't quit the discord and start problems."
"15103540","15103920"," I agree. "
"15108930","15109670"," A hundred percent."
"15109910","15110430"," We called you out."
"15110510","15110950"," You're a boyfriend. "
"15112770","15113130"," Yeah."
"15115090","15118070"," We called you out to make sure that we said don't fuck with your wife's boyfriend."
"15118370","15119410"," Don't fuck with Jason Hendricks. "
"15119590","15120390"," Don't fuck with Winky."
"15120450","15121710"," Don't fuck with any of you guys in there."
"15124910","15125270"," Yeah. "
"15125350","15125870"," Don't fuck with those."
"15126070","15127250"," That's the whole point."
"15127390","15128070"," Don't fuck with those. "
"15128350","15129910"," These guys are posting right now."
"15129910","15132530"," Every day they're inside."
"15132830","15133710"," They're breaking their dicks. "
"15137500","15139140"," All these guys are posting right there."
"15139320","15140820"," And they're every single day working hard."
"15154150","15155330"," Yeah, please like the streams. "
"15168040","15168480"," Yeah."
"15178970","15180730"," Blind Nestle was in there all the time too."
"15180990","15181990"," I didn't even say his name. "
"15182170","15183270"," I did miss Blind Nestle."
"15183610","15184690"," He's in there all the time."
"15185190","15185810"," Or she. "
"15186910","15187630"," Blind Nestle."
"15187910","15188430"," Where are you?"
"15188610","15189430"," How do you like to be called?"

"15801000","15802560"," You're losing the momentum."
"15802620","15805500"," If you lose the one minute and you're losing a ton of momentum. "
"15805500","15807300"," If you lose the five minute down here."
"15808940","15811480"," And you're likely to test some lows below."
"15826720","15832860"," They're not EMA's, but I'm trying to put because I can't put an indicator on Webull. "
"15833000","15834220"," We're going to switch over at some point."

"15874680","15876240"," You can do the long end short with this. "
"15877080","15884120"," And you'll be able to know if we're bullish or bearish for a length of time."
"15885180","15887880"," And it's very, very good at what it does."
"15889100","15891080"," Very, very, very good at what it does. "
"15893260","15894380"," Yeah, I think it is too."
"15895280","15896460"," I think it's a day bull trap."

"15931390","15933830"," thirteen EMA on a one minute chart. "
"15933830","15937770"," But they don't they only work for like an hour or two and then I have to go back and"

"16198770","16199730"," I'm so fucking naked."
"16213720","16214800"," Three ninety one. "
"16217080","16219660"," Someone just mentioned the lower area of balance."
"16219880","16220280"," Let's look at that."
"16222700","16224140"," Yeah, that's right here, right?"
"16231020","16233240"," What is that three ninety one ninety nine?"
"16233700","16234640"," That's true range. "
"16236420","16238200"," Three ninety two ninety three."
"16241720","16243880"," I guess that would be a rejection point, huh?"
"16244020","16244740"," On that price target?"
"16250120","16251280"," Be careful up here."
"16251420","16252580"," There's sharks swimming above here. "
"16252720","16252820"," Okay?"
"16254880","16255480"," There's sharks."
"16255700","16256780"," They don't want you getting in here."
"16259040","16260940"," They definitely don't want you getting in there. "
"16265710","16267310"," Well, we'll put this."
"16268630","16270070"," There's some sharks up here."
"16272090","16272650"," Bottom. "
"16275650","16276990"," Upper range, maybe."
"16277310","16278830"," I don't know if that's the best way to describe it."
"16280890","16283330"," Upper bottom of previous upper range. "
"16287290","16288930"," Previous upper true range."
"16289250","16290310"," I don't know if that's better to say."
"16291850","16293210"," Upper true range. "
"16298800","16299880"," Somewhere right in here."
"16312590","16313750"," Yeah, I'll bring up."
"16315570","16316770"," Bring it up for you here. "
"16328040","16329980"," Three ninety fifty two."
"16330200","16332400"," You want to hold that three ninety fifty two."
"16334420","16336540"," Target above three ninety two forty eight. "
"16340080","16341580"," Three ninety fifty two."
"16349720","16351240"," See that blue line right there?"
"16351800","16353280"," Three ninety fifty one right now?"
"16357880","16358620"," See that blue?"
"16358740","16360960"," See my cursor over here where it says three ninety fifty one?"
"16365400","16367360"," Watch that little blue blue line right there."
"16402320","16404360"," We don't want to lose this blue line right here. "
"16416840","16417720"," We need more coffee."
"16432050","16433750"," Pretty big seller stepping in."
"16450320","16452800"," Damn three ninety ones were forty two cents. "
"16453020","16457599"," Just a moment ago they went to fifty cents forty nine cents in like a minute or not a minute."
"16457660","16459599"," I mean like ten like two seconds."
"16468140","16469439"," Right on John Hagerty. "
"16470160","16471820"," Both sides long and short."
"16472200","16474320"," Same day seventeen hundred and eighty bucks right on."
"16479400","16481500"," Three ninety ones now trading fifty two cents. "
"16497740","16500140"," We bounced right off that one minute like it was nothing."
"16506619","16508220"," I'm in those calls right now."
"16508220","16513660"," I hope we don't roll here. "
"16536750","16540730"," I grabbed some of fifty two there at fifty eight fifty seven."
"16550279","16551000"," Nope."
"16555140","16556939"," I got out of fifty four. "
"16560540","16561680"," I'm flat again."
"16570520","16572880"," Little rolly little rolly isn't it?"
"16578810","16581990"," I don't like this cluster right here."
"16582230","16582450"," Sorry. "
"16582669","16583490"," I'm tired."
"16583830","16585130"," I don't like this cluster right here."
"16590490","16593990"," Yeah three to eight puts are now be careful in here. "
"16594250","16595849"," Three to eight puts are now four cents."
"16596790","16600290"," So three to eight P's that expire today on the nineteen."
"16601369","16604689"," Are now worth this four hundred and sixteen thousand contracts. "
"16605669","16607050"," They're worth like four cents."
"16609470","16611849"," You might we might get rolly in here."
"16638349","16639150"," I'm going to check. "
"16651669","16652610"," Man they don't want to."
"16652770","16656890"," They're not going to fucking print my three ninety sevens for tomorrow until the bell and burn"
"16656890","16657130"," them."
"16658050","16659009"," I can already tell. "
"16660610","16661730"," They're going to burn my stuff."
"16662090","16664570"," If we get up here today I'm going to close out my calls for tomorrow."
"16665869","16667869"," If we get like three ninety two three ninety three. "
"16685150","16688650"," They're taking around with my they're taking around with my Tesla calls to."
"16691470","16695369"," They're going to try to burn anyone that bought like one thirty five on the bell on Tesla."
"16697630","16700570"," At least burn the options even if they go there they're going to burn them. "
"16701290","16702830"," That fucking pisses me off."
"16706800","16708960"," I'm not positioned properly for tomorrow."
"16717340","16718880"," My whole goal there we go. "
"16719540","16723259"," My whole get my whole plan here at this point is probably try to."
"16724259","16727740"," Close my bad positioning on trades I took on the bell yesterday."
"16729419","16729960"," And. "
"16732540","16734560"," Just zero dated all the way up into tomorrow."
"16741790","16744470"," A friendly reminder if you are a bull."
"16746430","16750710"," And you feel like you got what you got with your pants down yesterday which you shouldn't have"
"16750710","16752050"," every day in this live stream. "
"16752189","16754210"," I think we've been talking about putting a hedge on the market."
"16754710","16756990"," So you shouldn't have been caught with your pants down."
"16757110","16759450"," If you did get caught with your pants down and haven't had a hedge on. "
"16759930","16763250"," We're entering the zone where you'd want to put a hedge on the market."
"16763590","16765570"," So we do talk about this regularly."
"16767630","16772950"," You can go back to any of our previous streams and you'll see that right from three eighty up into"
"16772950","16774050"," four hundred. "
"16774890","16779750"," We've said consistently to put a quarterly hedge on the market."
"16780510","16784690"," So if you have never had one or if you were bitching yesterday or whining or crying."
"16785350","16788450"," Having a hard day yesterday and you didn't have a hedge on. "
"16788950","16794410"," And even this morning we talked about when puts get cheap right if you own the underlying that you"
"16794410","16795470"," buy dated."
"16796630","16800470"," You know not penny but cheap puts and you hold them until they expire."
"16801450","16809490"," We've talked about hedges on esta we've talked about put spreads dated out for March 17th right. "
"16810110","16814790"," We've talked about esta for June contracts calls June contracts."
"16815010","16817690"," So I know you both get lightheaded again."
"16818270","16820330"," In all areas we're up here. "
"16821250","16825670"," This is one of those places this is the beginning of one of those places."
"16825670","16830510"," This is the upper right the bottom of the previous upper true range."
"16831330","16833730"," If you want to slap something on for March 17th. "
"16835490","16839630"," You know a hundred points one way or another aren't going to really make a difference on them."
"16841390","16847410"," You can always start a position here and continue to add to it as we trade higher into four oh"
"16847410","16847650"," six."
"16849270","16854130"," You can always put a hedge on and day trade up until the market rolls. "
"16854130","16856570"," Just a fair warning to you."
"16865950","16867190"," Captain's flat let's run it."
"16870230","16871270"," It's totally true. "
"16873150","16874090"," It's totally true."
"16874210","16875310"," I'm probably going to take a break here."
"16875490","16876630"," We'll start to lose the one minute. "
"16878230","16882750"," If you see us actually lose the one minute here we should have a retrace."
"16883650","16886470"," I'm going to give you a price target for a retrace if we do."
"16887110","16889470"," It's a three ninety nine seventy eight. "
"16890170","16892150"," The other screen lines not perfect."
"16892790","16895050"," Three nine seventy eight currently okay."
"16896170","16898250"," So slightly lower if we lose this. "
"16900470","16902770"," We haven't lost it yet but if we do lose it."
"16903650","16904890"," Right about there."
"16909970","16912090"," I'll look lower and see if there's anything lower. "
"16912630","16914330"," There really isn't we're pretty supportive here."
"16915610","16917270"," So far pretty supportive."
"16918950","16922830"," You could see for two eighteen where's two eighteen. "
"16924470","16925530"," Two eighteen."
"16927690","16929230"," I would look for."
"16930950","16933230"," I would also look for right here. "
"16937850","16939850"," This would be your downside down here."
"16955250","16957910"," I don't think we necessarily trade through here."
"16959770","16961870"," I'd be looking more for something like. "
"16964010","16967790"," A roll down here consolidation and then you make a move higher right up there."
"16968430","16973070"," If we if we break this keep this in mind to a mental picture for yourself."
"16979730","16986720"," I'm probably going to go to the bathroom so you guys can run it up. "
"16986800","16988300"," I got to take a leak pretty bad."
"16991780","16994580"," So I'm going to leave the stream up right here so you can see it."
"17005880","17007220"," This isn't really the best box. "
"17018920","17020300"," I'm starting to lose the one minute."
"17027540","17028380"," And I'll be right back."
"17028500","17029120"," I'm going to take a quick break. "
"17030980","17033400"," It's two fifty oh sorry two fifty one already."
"17033680","17035260"," Shit we might have this run right now."
"17036420","17038720"," You might come right down here this green line and get a run higher. "
"17039020","17039360"," I'm going to stick."
"17039680","17040560"," Give me ten minutes."
"17040580","17041560"," I'm going to take a quick piss. "
"17043020","17043560"," My intent."
"17043900","17044960"," I didn't know we were that late in the day."
"17045820","17048140"," I'm looking for this right here this trade higher in the bell. "
"17049940","17051020"," I don't know if we get it but."
"17051500","17052760"," I don't know where that late in the day."
"17053320","17054720"," So I'm looking for that trade right there. "
"17060130","17061090"," Give me ten minutes."
"17068520","17075210"," I'm going to go to a beer."
"17075490","17076150"," I haven't drank anything. "
"17076470","17078370"," I'm going to go to beer and have a beer with you guys last hour."
"17079390","17082130"," If you guys want to grab a beer or a shot of whiskey or a doobie."
"17083190","17084950"," Your wife's boyfriend you want to grab a doobie. "
"17086870","17087030"," And."
"17088650","17091530"," Wherever you guys do you guys drink tea or something or."
"17092730","17094790"," I don't know what's drink water. "
"17096330","17097270"," I'll bring it back."
"17612480","17614180"," Oh baby here we go."
"17615300","17616420"," Here we go. "
"17618780","17620620"," Oh baby I see it."
"17905500","17907400"," All right come back here."
"17907720","17909140"," I just want to quickly say. "
"17910920","17912460"," I got a beer by the way."
"17916020","17917560"," I got to make it one more day."
"17918660","17920780"," We still have one more day to stream. "
"17922980","17924860"," Look at that roll huh."
"17925540","17926620"," Trying to shake up."
"17927160","17930900"," I don't normally watch Jim Kramer in this morning on. "
"17932340","17932640"," The news."
"17933640","17937160"," They had a highlight where they showed Jim Kramer saying some shit."
"17937600","17939480"," And I never watched him or read him. "
"17939840","17943080"," And I read the story from him and he's like."
"17943080","17945400"," This is all about shaking out weak hands."
"17946140","17948500"," And I was like that's some art cash and shit right there. "
"17949160","17951040"," Just shaking out weak hands right now."
"17951440","17952620"," For the next leg up."
"17954200","17957100"," And I was like I can't believe a guy on fucking CNBC saying. "
"17957980","17959140"," Shaking out the weak hands."
"17960280","17961740"," I haven't heard that term."
"17962140","17964460"," That's an old art cash and shit right there. "
"17966740","17967580"," Okay so."
"17971140","17973080"," Let's do a review for today and for tomorrow."
"17973160","17974220"," We've got one more day left. "
"17974500","17974760"," We've got."
"17975480","17976680"," It's three oh seven."
"17977140","17980560"," We'll talk about some positioning down the road as well. "
"17981460","17983120"," And let's just this week."
"17983120","17985740"," We talked about this week being a big week to be."
"17986540","17988780"," Paying attention to is this rotation. "
"17989320","17990700"," We started this on Tuesday right."
"17991180","17992480"," Came out on Tuesday and said."
"17993160","17996320"," What's important mostly about this week is to find out if we are. "
"17997320","18000920"," Rotating or if we are in a distribution phase."
"18002020","18004260"," It's pretty big sell off yesterday right."
"18004800","18006360"," Let's just have a start with today. "
"18007380","18008900"," So not shockingly."
"18010920","18011900"," Hold on here."
"18023240","18029540"," We have a four hundred and four hundred and nineteen thousand puts on three eighty eight. "
"18032200","18034360"," So I do want you to see that here."
"18034360","18036220"," Hold on a second here."
"18038260","18040380"," So expiring today okay. "
"18043060","18044200"," Are some puts."
"18047100","18048560"," Right down here next one."
"18050200","18050840"," Okay. "
"18052300","18054160"," So think about this for tomorrow."
"18054400","18056280"," I just want as a kind of like a mind."
"18056940","18059740"," Kind of like a mind experiment or. "
"18061100","18063060"," Just keep this in the back of your mind."
"18063060","18063380"," Okay."
"18063600","18066280"," We've got puts that are expiring today. "
"18067020","18069280"," Down at three eighty eight."
"18069660","18071260"," We have a pin down here."
"18073100","18074040"," Three eighty eight. "
"18074580","18076900"," So the dealers want to do one of two things."
"18079360","18081020"," They either do not want to let these."
"18081120","18083320"," Well they don't want to let these expire in the money of course. "
"18086200","18088420"," They don't mind usually if they print."
"18089900","18092080"," Some of these spreads as they get closed."
"18092880","18095160"," So you make your thirteen cents or twelve cents or whatever. "
"18096380","18097500"," Very rarely."
"18099140","18101840"," Would like the wood puts or calls pin."
"18103180","18104900"," To where they're actually in the money. "
"18105200","18105820"," The IE."
"18106860","18109580"," That we would trade down below three eighty eight."
"18110340","18111880"," Some rare we do though. "
"18112240","18114980"," It was interesting on so we're in mopex right now so."
"18115600","18117340"," Like when we were when we were in."
"18118160","18121700"," Quad-witching three witches on in December. "
"18122060","18124600"," You guys remember when we were closing."
"18126580","18129360"," We were like oh shit a whole bunch of people are going to get."
"18130200","18133160"," Assigned in this in this in this quarterly. "
"18134100","18135960"," Whole bunch of assignments happened."
"18136620","18139200"," We might see more of this tomorrow being mopex."
"18139480","18142220"," We'll somewhere real wonky weird stuff going on. "
"18142220","18145800"," Where we actually close and pin to that number."
"18146220","18149940"," So just just keep an eye on this as the day as the last hour unfolds."
"18150460","18154400"," Do we trade down to this three eighty eight or I think it would be near it. "
"18154860","18157780"," So that they at least print spreads for for tomorrow."
"18158280","18165220"," But the impact is not as much on today as it would be on like a mopex or three witches."
"18165900","18168800"," Quad or two witches whatever which depends on the month. "
"18169860","18172820"," Depends on what part of the month or quarter month it is."
"18172900","18174140"," Excuse me and the yearly."
"18175960","18177120"," The impact of it. "
"18177220","18180620"," But I just want to think about that as we come into tomorrow and this not being."
"18180980","18183320"," Tomorrow is the actual mopex I believe."
"18183760","18188900"," But even just today in like a daily chart how close it actually pins to it. "
"18189560","18192880"," Start to consider that or away from it."
"18193900","18196220"," And the interplay that happens in the market."
"18198280","18201260"," So if they do get close to it they're not going to want to be worth a lot. "
"18201440","18205000"," They're going to they're trying to get them down to like usually it's like eight cents to fourteen"
"18205000","18205440"," cents."
"18205620","18206800"," And then you see where it should happen."
"18207660","18212480"," Arbitrage happened in the after hours where they're near worthless and then they nail it right"
"18212480","18213640"," after they nail it sometime. "
"18213920","18219240"," This is why you don't want to ever hold spreads into the expiry to the actual true quote."
"18219240","18222760"," Well not well the true close for retail traders at four four fifteen."
"18223440","18227640"," Because they don't actually close them then they close them at like six p.m. That's where you get"
"18227640","18231620"," your assignments sometimes you get a fucking phone call and be like yeah man we assigned you like. "
"18231920","18237880"," No no no no no we close that at four fifteen we close that three eighty nine forty let's say."
"18238380","18243700"," And what truly those they don't they don't actually close them until after you can't trade them"
"18243700","18245820"," anymore between four fifteen and I believe it's six."
"18246400","18249960"," Or six thirty don't pin me on the time but I think it's six or six thirty in the afternoon. "
"18250780","18256520"," That's why you close the spread always because the single single single single single of single"
"18256520","18258220"," ticker like an apple or something."
"18258900","18263920"," You only have until four p.m. if you're on an index you've gotten till four fifteen but never ever"
"18263920","18268200"," ever ever let any spread close auto close."
"18268780","18273240"," Because they can auto close them at a way off price and we're in ER season. "
"18273240","18281300"," So you could see like the S&P 500 after close swing up or down fucking thirty points in like"
"18281300","18282260"," you know five minutes."
"18283080","18290360"," Especially on like big tech it's one of my favorite trades is trading the closes on big ER days"
"18290360","18293580"," like the queues or you trade trades by."
"18294340","18298700"," And you'll get like thirty forty fifty point moves into the close. "
"18300540","18306580"," It's one of the it's one of my favorite ways to synthetically trade ER is instead of trading the"
"18306580","18307420"," actual ticker."
"18309040","18313720"," And the reason being is this think about this for a second okay to on this talk about it discord"
"18313720","18314840"," and see what you think about this."
"18316600","18324180"," So let's say I wanted to trade a high impact stock like apple. "
"18325720","18331320"," Microsoft did it two years ago I think Microsoft or Google had a fake report out."
"18333180","18339160"," And was Microsoft or Google and they like dumped like Microsoft or Google one of them like a heavy"
"18339160","18339960"," hitter like apple."
"18340520","18344000"," And they fucking dumped at like four oh one. "
"18345400","18349260"," Now if I was in an apple trade I would have gotten fucked on that trade right it couldn't do"
"18349260","18349600"," anything."
"18349600","18355280"," But if I was synthetically trading it in the spy I could do something about it."
"18355980","18360840"," So if there's like initial red bar down that comes back up in spy I could be long let's say"
"18360840","18362260"," and be get fucked up in that trade. "
"18362740","18368200"," I could cut my losses on the next green bar up and then if apple continues down later on I'm"
"18368200","18370500"," not stuck in the trade right."
"18371100","18376360"," Now the other caveat to this is you more than likely still have to close that trade by four"
"18376360","18376740"," fifteen."
"18377500","18382560"," Because you also know that if apple not always but especially if it's green bar up they green bar"
"18382560","18388400"," up by open the next day or flat again oftentimes in spy and cues you'll see the same thing wild"
"18388400","18390120"," ass moves for fifteen minutes. "
"18390880","18393480"," Opens up the next day and it's fucking flat."
"18393900","18399960"," I've seen on ERs and big tick ticker report days I've seen fucking spy bleed out like 70 points and"
"18399960","18405080"," then be back at 30 to 70 points I should say maybe not 70 but like 30 points down."
"18405660","18408760"," And then come straight back to flat by open next day. "
"18409140","18416820"," That would be the last thing I'd tell you is on the big ER reports with the big indexes that"
"18416820","18418000"," could fuck your trade up."
"18418120","18425740"," If you're trying to hold a trade for an up or down move day three four five days later and"
"18425740","18431360"," you're expecting like we're going to make progress in these next five days and then some report"
"18431360","18434500"," comes in and it winds up making spy open flat."
"18435080","18440640"," So you overnight or flat flat flat because it was down or it was too high up and it trades"
"18440640","18442780"," back into balance by the time we open the next day. "
"18442860","18444080"," Just be aware of all that stuff too."
"18444760","18448960"," So if you're trying to like synthetically trade ERs on the day that they're or the night that they"
"18448960","18454920"," report is like if anyone is reporting after hours that move move an index."
"18455800","18459380"," Sometimes there's some kick ass trades between four and four fifteen. "
"18460080","18465480"," You're literally like you're like entering either or usually it's just after the bell because"
"18465480","18468140"," there's no there's no volume."
"18469560","18474380"," You don't want to be like buying calls on a rip higher into spy when there's a bunch of interest"
"18474380","18479140"," and then be holding those calls after the bell if we drop right."
"18479620","18485080"," You want to like be buying calls when the same number of people are buying calls and puts and all"
"18485080","18486640"," that kind of stuff and exiting those trades. "
"18487200","18489160"," While there's still people in them right."
"18492160","18496520"," So we've got a pin down or another pin we've got a we don't want to trade close the three"
"18496520","18498020"," to eight down below into the close."
"18498020","18499980"," We had just had a big buy right here. "
"18500720","18505920"," We had some financial juice back on looks like we got some firing into the bell here."
"18506600","18509580"," Nice group big green bar right here buyers right here."
"18510860","18515380"," So we're going to talk about the next two days of trading and probably next week. "
"18518320","18520080"," We'll do a 15 minute chart."
"18520260","18521680"," We're going to go through a bunch of different charts here."
"18522400","18523800"," So let's do the. "
"18525040","18526080"," So one minute."
"18527180","18530020"," Bulls are losing some strength here."
"18530680","18534340"," Not full strength, but they're losing some strength at this moment. "
"18534580","18536460"," We've we've traded below the one minute."
"18536540","18538040"," We're at the five minute right now."
"18538040","18540380"," The screen green arrows representing a five minute. "
"18541480","18543300"," If we go on to a five minute chart."
"18544720","18548160"," Bulls are still in charge here in the five minute right."
"18548980","18550200"," We go to a 15 minute. "
"18550800","18555800"," Bulls are still in charge right not in charge, but they they're running the boards right now."
"18556040","18558580"," They're holding the 15 minute at three eighty nine forty nine."
"18559640","18560780"," On the one hour. "
"18562320","18564420"," The bears are still in charge."
"18564900","18565120"," Okay."
"18565240","18566140"," I want you to realize that. "
"18566600","18569300"," The hourly is a very important thing for."
"18569460","18571500"," There's two trends that you need to know about."
"18571500","18576060"," Or there's two or there's multiple time frames that you need to be concerned about. "
"18576900","18581260"," So the hourly is is the direction that we're going in like a weekly."
"18581780","18584120"," Not just on the daily, but on a weekly basis."
"18584500","18586560"," An hourly is going to tell you. "
"18587600","18589140"," Which direction we're trading for the week."
"18589220","18590200"," So somebody says to you."
"18590800","18592180"," Are you bullish right now?"
"18592520","18593760"," Or are you are you bearish right now?"
"18594160","18595680"," You can actually answer that question on a."
"18596120","18597860"," On a on an intraday chart. "
"18598280","18600740"," A weekly chart or you should be able to answer that."
"18600740","18603040"," Pan, a daily on bullish or bearish."
"18603440","18605000"," On a weekly on bullish or bearish. "
"18605120","18607840"," On a monthly on bullish or bearish on a quarterly and then on a yearly."
"18609060","18610700"," And you should ask people that people ask you."
"18610780","18611400"," Are you bullish here?"
"18611560","18614560"," You should say that your response should always be on what time frame. "
"18614680","18617700"," It's important to have that context on a time frame."
"18618640","18622160"," For where where your bullish and how long your bullish or bearish."
"18622900","18627340"," So right now right on a on a weekly time frame. "
"18627580","18629340"," The bears are still in charge right now."
"18629340","18629580"," Okay."
"18630400","18632560"," Bears still have the ball right now. "
"18633180","18636380"," Right came down here traded up just rejected off the hourly."
"18637460","18640680"," Bulls are still in charge at this moment on a daily."
"18643100","18645780"," Look at that in decision. "
"18647330","18649000"," You see this in decision right here."
"18649960","18653160"," This is bullish for the bulls for tomorrow."
"18653860","18654440"," Okay. "
"18654780","18659100"," They're fighting for their lives on the hour on the on the on the."
"18659100","18660020"," Daily candle here."
"18662020","18665220"," I want you to also look at if you know this now right. "
"18665820","18667800"," Just that's just on a daily basis right."
"18669020","18671960"," We have a monthly moving average coming up underneath."
"18672240","18673260"," I want you to be aware of that. "
"18673880","18677900"," We have some power that's unseen on this chart coming behind us here."
"18678440","18679560"," Trying to push us higher."
"18681440","18684080"," We're going to go to a five day chart. "
"18687620","18694360"," And the bears are like we sold this down."
"18695680","18696280"," Right."
"18697060","18701180"," And we want to reload to send you lower into confirm. "
"18702980","18704360"," That we're going lower."
"18706900","18709440"," And so they're going to work this right here."
"18710420","18711820"," They're resetting themselves. "
"18712120","18713980"," You heard me say earlier in the broadcast."
"18714740","18719440"," If you're a bull and you're whining yesterday you know you can trade zero dates or weeklies."
"18720260","18723660"," But if you don't have a hedge on to participate in a sell off. "
"18724520","18730220"," I don't know why you're willing to spend 40 cents on some fucking zero dates but not 40 cents on"
"18730220","18733980"," some OTM put spreads that you can put on right."
"18734980","18738660"," OTM put spreads are for middle of March 40 cents 50 cents."
"18740220","18744680"," So we're starting to get into that place where you can put those on even if they get burned. "
"18745620","18746640"," You don't do all your money here."
"18746640","18750180"," We talked about that all this here when we talk about this all the time."
"18750280","18750700"," We're in the place. "
"18751200","18754520"," You guys if you're going at Captain's Alpha you saw the fucking chart right."
"18754960","18757680"," I mean I don't know how clear that needs to be."
"18758420","18764380"," I mean this chart from this this chart from this this chart that I showed you this morning. "
"18765200","18765940"," This chart."
"18766880","18771360"," I don't post on that Captain's Alpha that often but when I do I fucking mean it right."
"18772200","18776140"," And this was nine or ten trading days ago we traded up here. "
"18777060","18781480"," Horse shoes and hand grades see that 4000 right here see that red bar right there."
"18782660","18784360"," We came up here so."
"18785380","18788880"," You know there's no reason here that you didn't know to put a hedge on. "
"18789180","18790840"," Now if you don't decide not to."
"18792320","18795080"," If you decide I'm not putting a hedge on that's fine."
"18795760","18798280"," You don't have to know it's telling you what you have to do. "
"18798360","18802580"," I'm certainly not telling you have to do but the information's been provided to you."
"18803120","18805160"," And then we last week specifically."
"18806460","18809560"," Last week specifically and then this is actually a chart. "
"18809760","18811180"," I actually had this chart from here."
"18811740","18813480"," Another five bars I had this chart."
"18813780","18814420"," I had this chart. "
"18814620","18816360"," I wrote this chart fucking sometime."
"18817960","18819360"," January third I think."
"18820100","18821920"," Which is like seven days before something. "
"18823320","18825280"," And we were already going up at this point."
"18826580","18829500"," Matter of fact there's a discord that has this chart."
"18830120","18832400"," There's actually a discord that has this chart. "
"18832860","18835240"," An earlier version of this chart not our discord."
"18835900","18838720"," James Rowland his discord has this chart."
"18840360","18842440"," From an earlier iteration of this. "
"18844820","18849740"," So my guess my point to you is I guess my point to you is I think it's an earlier"
"18849740","18850060"," version."
"18850060","18853040"," I'm saying that but I don't know if I can confirm but I think it is."
"18853540","18855800"," So my point to you is that. "
"18857480","18860280"," We even last week we talked about building a hedge."
"18861280","18864180"," That could be just in the money that's dated out here right."
"18864440","18867400"," Something that even if we blast it up like how do you build a hedge. "
"18867800","18873620"," So that it'll absorb a trip to 420 and then we come back down and retest 380 right."
"18874240","18876980"," So again just just due diligence."
"18877780","18880880"," You guys know what's up with that now. "
"18881340","18884440"," So this is what the bears are looking for and they're looking to trade."
"18885080","18890060"," Down here okay I want to I want you to actually see what they're looking for a bloodbath."
"18890460","18891860"," There's the green one right there. "
"18891860","18892840"," So we'll do it on a."
"18897380","18898840"," Do it on a one hour maybe."
"18899880","18901400"," See if we can find on this chart."
"18901680","18903620"," Sometimes it shows up well and sometimes it doesn't. "
"18903700","18904160"," It's right there."
"18905080","18906620"," So the bears are looking for."
"18907320","18910300"," The fed appears to be on top for a soft landing. "
"18911440","18915500"," Bears are looking for something like this bears are looking for put another hedge on."
"18916420","18922000"," Putting another puts on letting you have your letting you have your er even if we squeeze up one"
"18922000","18922280"," day."
"18922740","18928060"," In a event eventual bloodbath down into into February could be later February but they're looking"
"18928060","18928540"," for that. "
"18928880","18930400"," What a bear is looking for right in here."
"18931060","18933800"," There's another part to this too I want to."
"18934480","18938580"," Now we're going to go to the bulls and I want to talk to you about the bulls okay what"
"18938580","18939540"," you have going for you. "
"18940300","18942040"," You have er going for you."
"18942680","18949560"," You have you have the idea that the fed's still tightening believe it or not going for you."
"18950200","18955660"," You have the fact that you have the fact that believe it or not. "
"18956100","18959180"," There were a shit ton of bears that were upside down in here."
"18959740","18963840"," When we made this move higher and I guarantee you they might not tell you."
"18964160","18970560"," Let's say too publicly but I guarantee you that some bears the moment we traded down here this"
"18970560","18970880"," morning. "
"18970880","18974480"," They were maybe break even in their hedge and said fuck this."
"18974960","18978140"," I'm closing out my shit and I'm going to reposition."
"18979200","18982860"," I guarantee that there were some bears. "
"18983380","18986760"," Matter of fact I bet you there are some bears today they were hoping for extension."
"18987520","18991380"," So they could just break even out of their heads that they placed in the wrong time."
"18992300","18995400"," So just be you know there's there bulls have that going for them. "
"18998060","19002720"," That this could have been just trying to unfuck yourself out of a bad hedge."
"19003580","19005700"," So think about that as a as a bull okay."
"19006200","19008680"," Now if you're a bull you have more work to do. "
"19009240","19016620"," You have to get above and hold this range this true range up here you need to get above."
"19017760","19022080"," Three ninety two you need to get above three ninety two you see that previous low."
"19022380","19025200"," You need to win that back again you need to get up here. "
"19025700","19030500"," Right consolidate with some confidence and start trading ER season."
"19031280","19036500"," Now one positive for bulls today is this I'll get I'm going to give I wasn't expecting this this"
"19036500","19036800"," morning."
"19037420","19042140"," We were looking around the sectors this morning and I'll tell you what I was looking at that XL"
"19042140","19042560"," you. "
"19043840","19049180"," And now there's two things I was concerned with with XL you tried two major concerns."
"19051560","19054260"," My first concern XL you is this."
"19055540","19061380"," Whenever we break down here in XL you not whenever but when we do right it can signal a market"
"19061380","19062340"," crash type situation. "
"19063580","19066560"," You want to see some kind of a bid in XL you."
"19067680","19071320"," I'm going to explain to you I'm going to explain if you've never heard this I'm going to explain"
"19071320","19072760"," this very clear for you okay."
"19073340","19074680"," In very simple terms. "
"19076000","19077200"," Super simple terms."
"19078240","19082180"," If you're using X I'm going to use XLF and XL you as an example."
"19084800","19087080"," If we're bullish on the stock market right. "
"19088820","19091860"," You want to see XL you do something like this right here."
"19092580","19094640"," A whole lot of nothing."
"19096840","19099500"," If we start trading up like this right. "
"19100080","19102800"," That means that market participants are scared okay."
"19105460","19109800"," So if we saw bid today you'd say that if you saw a bid next XL you and no bid"
"19109800","19110640"," and XLF."
"19112240","19114320"," You would be like ah they're a little scared right now. "
"19120060","19125020"," I would have liked to have seen some kind of bid next XLF and XL you today but I didn't"
"19125020","19125760"," see any bid next."
"19125760","19126860"," So that's concerning."
"19128940","19131760"," I don't want to see XL you start trading down like this. "
"19132920","19134880"," This is to be super bearish."
"19136540","19145580"," But while I'm looking at XL you do this I'm also going to be looking at risk on sectors in"
"19145580","19146320"," the stock market."
"19146560","19148760"," So I'm going to right now check as we close XLF. "
"19152930","19154810"," That's a pretty good bid right there."
"19154810","19156410"," Pretty good bid right there."
"19156510","19157410"," It's nice to see that. "
"19158950","19159470"," Right."
"19159770","19166190"," They might be saying yeah you know the portfolio managers exited XL you and they're entering XLF."
"19166970","19168850"," I'm going to look at XLK right now. "
"19174180","19176280"," We got tech earnings coming up right."
"19176620","19179420"," We already had financial earnings we got tech earnings coming up."
"19179860","19182420"," They got a decent size bid not bad but decent. "
"19183300","19188880"," If I had seen XLU get a bid in XLF start or XLF or XLK continue to sell off that"
"19188880","19189440"," would be concerning."
"19193060","19195080"," XLC caught a huge bid."
"19195380","19196480"," Huge bid. "
"19201180","19201820"," XLY."
"19205300","19206520"," Decent size bid."
"19208820","19211320"," XLP this is another XLU type stock. "
"19211320","19213540"," Not so good right here."
"19213600","19214360"," Don't like seeing this."
"19215900","19220660"," You know this kind of shows me like a sideways market inspired right now. "
"19222040","19224220"," But there's there's real fear in the market."
"19224260","19225120"," I want you to know that."
"19225240","19229880"," There's so there's some fear in the market and there's some bid into upcoming ER season. "
"19230960","19232240"," Very fair for man."
"19232360","19237020"," This sets up like a move for if we have start having bad earnings they're going to sell this market"
"19237020","19237400"," down."
"19237540","19239540"," I'm just I'm still concerned at this point. "
"19241320","19242540"," I'm still concerned here."
"19252660","19254880"," Just just looking at this stuff right here."
"19256640","19258500"," This looks like you're walking the plank. "
"19259380","19263600"," If if if if you're going to get much just just looking at just this not looking at the VIX"
"19263600","19265000"," and not looking at HYG yet."
"19265580","19267420"," I'm not looking at TLT nothing."
"19267600","19269000"," I'm not looking at gold anything else. "
"19269280","19270960"," We're saying to you right now that this looks."
"19271700","19274020"," To me like walk the plank."
"19275000","19276920"," Like we're going to remove risk from the market. "
"19277520","19281560"," We're going to put a small bit put some like 100% portfolio."
"19282400","19284480"," I probably am going to put a hedge on the market."
"19284800","19288020"," I'm going to put a little bit of risk out there and who's reporting next. "
"19288360","19292080"," There's no way that I'm hiding in XLU and XLP."
"19292600","19294320"," That's more fear than normal."
"19296320","19298080"," So that's what I'm taking from this. "
"19299060","19300020"," I'll look at VIX."
"19300180","19301180"," I'll look at HYG."
"19301180","19323780"," Mark's on"
"19323780","19324580"," close imbalance. "
"19325140","19325620"," One spot."
"19325920","19327620"," One billion to the south side."
"19331640","19337380"," Yeah, I mean, you know, it's like bid in VIX bid in VIX. "
"19338160","19339960"," Come down bid in VIX."
"19340580","19341840"," Here, here, here."
"19342360","19344240"," Looking to stay on track to go higher here. "
"19345820","19350900"," You know, so this is like the resting bitch face of VIX."
"19350900","19353780"," If I had to call it something, it's the resting bitch face of VIX."
"19365840","19368540"," Demand's still there for HYG. "
"19374340","19376380"," This is all weight in C here, man."
"19376580","19378280"," HYG looks like weight in C too."
"19379560","19381420"," Easy to sell off in HYG. "
"19389930","19391770"," So all looks like weight in C to me."
"19397490","19399170"," S-style reset today."
"19401330","19401770"," NDX. "
"19429360","19430520"," We'll make this look bigger."
"19430660","19431820"," This thing looks tiny as all fuck."
"19436320","19437520"," Now, I'll tell you what, man. "
"19437640","19438880"," You look at NDX right here, right?"
"19439460","19440740"," We have a bad earnings season."
"19441240","19442880"," We have bad tech earnings season down."
"19443000","19444080"," We start doing this bounce around. "
"19445480","19446600"," This will disappear."
"19446600","19452420"," And then that literally means we're going down to test 10,000."
"19452900","19458740"," If the bulls give up 10,000, you're talking about major lows. "
"19460160","19461960"," 6,500 on tap."
"19463020","19465160"," This is what the plank right here."
"19465260","19465880"," That's what this is. "
"19472860","19475220"," This looks like what the plank to me."
"19476380","19479520"," So everything's riding on, everything's riding on earnings season."
"19486020","19487600"," Everything's riding on earnings season. "
"19487960","19491820"," Sellers are waiting above to sell earnings season down."
"19494080","19496700"," Better have some good news on tap this earnings season."
"19498460","19500080"," Now, how do you trade this, right?"
"19500260","19501320"," We've got the clothes here. "
"19501920","19503620"," We have range expansion next week."
"19504080","19505220"," I'm going to show it to you, okay?"
"19508160","19510520"," We have some range expansion next week."
"19510680","19511820"," It's basically all right. "
"19511940","19512680"," I'll just show it to you."
"19513460","19514000"," Hold on."
"19515060","19516380"," I think I've showed this before. "
"19521180","19522740"," We'll show it again to you right now."
"19533770","19535180"," I don't know if I can show it here or not."
"19538440","19539280"," Earnings this week. "
"19539960","19541540"," This isn't showing it, is it?"
"19543540","19545020"," This might show it, I'm not sure."
"19548790","19550270"," You know, let me show you a range expansion."
"19550730","19559110"," So this is the 20th expected move this week, 0.7%. Next week,"
"19559590","19569170"," for the 27th, we have a 2%"
"19569170","19570010"," move expected. "
"19570010","19573970"," And this is where the big daddy comes in."
"19578970","19580250"," February 1st, right?"
"19580570","19582290"," It starts to ramp into the end of the month."
"19584430","19586970"," 31st, 30th, a little bit starts to expand. "
"19587870","19589430"," And the 1st, it starts to explode."
"19590950","19595970"," You know, you got 2.4%, 2.7%. As we head into February, right?"
"19596490","19605350"," February 10th, 3.1%, 3.6%. This is expected, 3.6% expected move by February 17th."
"19608430","19608490"," Right?"
"19609350","19610450"," 4% move. "
"19611590","19613730"," And they're already setting up for it."
"19622850","19627390"," So, you know, even if we have a high here, even if we get us some great reports here, they're"
"19627390","19629930"," just waiting to come right in to sell this down."
"19632250","19633990"," Into the end of the month. "
"19637070","19638350"," In early February."
"19641950","19642990"," Yeah, everything's right."
"19644590","19652340"," Yeah, where's Mero?"
"19652480","19653580"," But I haven't seen him either. "
"19654560","19656940"," I'll have to check out him and fin to it and see how he's doing."
"19662950","19664650"," I haven't seen Mero either."
"19669730","19670790"," So for tomorrow. "
"19670790","19671110"," For tomorrow."
"19681070","19682410"," This is what I'm looking for."
"19683750","19685110"," I'm going to look for. "
"19686370","19687890"," Or we look on this."
"19694410","19694970"," 123."
"19696450","19697950"," I'm looking for. "
"19699650","19702190"," 392 28 from where we are right now."
"19703390","19705110"," I don't care if it's right now."
"19705390","19706650"," I don't care if it's a."
"19706650","19707890"," What did I say?"
"19709630","19712470"," Yeah, 392 30 somewhere in here 392 30. "
"19712850","19714210"," I'm looking for this move higher."
"19714390","19715470"," I don't care if it's right now."
"19716450","19718050"," I don't care if it's at the bell. "
"19718350","19720290"," I don't care if it's on tomorrow's open."
"19721010","19722110"," We're coming up here."
"19722130","19722890"," I guarantee it. "
"19723150","19723930"," Not guarantee it."
"19724070","19726450"," We might have some market news where I can't guarantee it."
"19727270","19731890"," We have dealers will attempt to buy futures to get us there as well. "
"19733090","19739750"," To at least retest the lower range of the upper range we had that we were in."
"19740550","19745270"," We're trying to find out if we're going to get reaccepted in there."
"19745950","19747330"," So that's my target from here. "
"19748850","19751130"," 392 48 minimum."
"19752030","19755090"," It would not shock me to see us trade to."
"19757410","19764050"," Would not shock me to press the trade tomorrow into the bell to 394 33 at minimum. "
"19765510","19768010"," And possibly even 397."
"19768670","19772150"," So if you had three targets for tomorrow, I'm going to give them to you right now."
"19772290","19772370"," Right. "
"19773110","19775810"," That's target number three target number two."
"19776590","19778190"," And target number one is 392."
"19783710","19784430"," So right. "
"19784570","19785870"," I'm going to give you some targets for tomorrow."
"19788310","19793570"," 392 48 394 46."
"19798380","19802480"," And 396 92 a failure of a failure of 397. "
"19809800","19811080"," Is that working for you?"
"19811180","19813160"," So there are my three targets for tomorrow."
"19815500","19816460"," From here."
"19818060","19820500"," They're going to be looking for a rejection above here. "
"19821700","19823740"," Failure of 397 on the high tomorrow."
"19832280","19835120"," Hey, you know what Robert love them is making a fair point."
"19835220","19836900"," I should have said I should have told them that Robert. "
"19838140","19839320"," I should have told them that."
"19840980","19844720"," Because you can actually study when risk off comes into the market with with XLU."
"19844820","19845900"," And there's some real danger here. "
"19845980","19847180"," I want you guys to know this."
"19847300","19847400"," Okay."
"19848100","19850880"," XLU should have had a decent bid today. "
"19851740","19856240"," If you're a bull, you wanted to see if you're your most bullish scenario would have been."
"19856900","19858820"," A small bid in XLU."
"19859100","19862180"," A huge bid on risk on sectors. "
"19863980","19865700"," And that would be bullish."
"19866600","19869640"," Not seeing XLU catch any bid today."
"19870540","19873600"," Means that portfolio managers like fuck this. "
"19875280","19877860"," I'm that's probably I'm probably hedged on the market."
"19877860","19880220"," I have to have a little bit of risk in the markets."
"19880220","19882760"," I'm going to put it on the companies that are reporting. "
"19883480","19886820"," And if anything goes wrong at any moment, they start selling this shit down."
"19886900","19887980"," It's probably going to get ugly."
"19889640","19891220"," If we start having bad reports. "
"19893100","19895200"," They don't want to they don't want to be in that that."
"19895520","19899820"," And this is like the kind of stuff that reminds me of early of early 2023."
"19901480","19904500"," Now this kind of risk off the next couple weeks. "
"19904620","19908400"," I'm going to say from now until the majors are done reporting."
"19920320","19923960"," When you're doing that, when Robert's telling you to do this study on."
"19924100","19926840"," One foot one billion to the south side on XLU. "
"19927960","19929260"," You want to be looking for."
"19930480","19931940"," You want to be looking for."
"19933280","19936140"," You like you'll see XLU will follow spy. "
"19937120","19940000"," You want to be looking for when there's divergence."
"19940260","19941660"," It's a very small period."
"19941800","19942880"," It's usually like a week or two. "
"19943620","19944300"," Well, you'll see diversions."
"19944820","19945900"," You can actually see it as well."
"19946140","19951320"," And if you if you if you have to do a study on HYG and spy. "
"19952380","19957620"," Not always, but sometimes you'll see a divergence in a very brief moment of time over the course of"
"19957620","19958760"," like one to three days."
"19959740","19963740"," Where HYG will tell you that the market is going to go down or go higher."
"19963740","19967180"," So like spy will be going down, but HYG will be coming up. "
"19967580","19969500"," And this lasts over like one to three days."
"19970280","19974400"," And then you'll be like, Oh, shit, spy needs to correct price to match HYG."
"19976320","19980140"," So you're not looking like if you overlay as an XLU in a spy chart. "
"19980500","19982120"," And it's like a year chart."
"19982340","19983260"," You might not see it."
"19983440","19989620"," But if you like, if whenever you whenever you you'll see a divergence, though, in a rollover in the"
"19989620","19989840"," spy. "
"19991160","19992820"," If you look closer at the chart."
"19999980","20004180"," Yeah, if we get some good reports, we can easily we can easily trade higher to 400."
"20005200","20006920"," Bulls have work to do you got. "
"20007080","20008720"," Bulls have not regained the hourly."
"20009020","20011120"," You have to read the you shouldn't be worried about that."
"20011180","20014540"," Your first thing you're looking for is to regain the hourly and that has not happened. "
"20023560","20024580"," Okay, so that."
"20027080","20032860"," I always love that."
"20032860","20035700"," 35 AP shopping inspiration and biting bull ankles. "
"20049450","20051390"," Perfect place to put a hedge on up here."
"20052150","20054450"," All the beginnings of a perfect place to put a hedge on."
"20056830","20062330"," If you have any problems, if you have personal problems with putting a hedge on that you can either"
"20062330","20062710"," afford. "
"20063790","20068050"," Or that you don't know how to understand how to put a hedge on that you can buy farther out"
"20068050","20069630"," in time and it not lose value."
"20069630","20076350"," You can literally literally turn it in and it will be flat if we don't burn to the depths of"
"20076350","20076530"," hell."
"20077230","20080010"," You should join us in the discord and ask. "
"20080910","20085010"," You should get on fin to it and become friends with people here and ask them."
"20086050","20088310"," To point you in the right direction of somebody."
"20090030","20093450"," I can show you how to put a hedge on that you won't lose value in. "
"20100370","20102110"," Yeah, plunge again, baby."
"20102450","20102750"," I agree."
"20103770","20107610"," I did not like I don't not like seeing that XL you didn't get any bid. "
"20108350","20111390"," I don't that is that is skull and crossbones for me."
"20113230","20117630"," I would have liked to have seen more bid next all you'd say this is why if I if I"
"20117630","20121810"," was going to label this ER season as we're coming into it."
"20122270","20125110"," It's walk the plank hands down. "
"20125730","20127010"," No other way to know."
"20127390","20128850"," No other way to describe it."
"20129750","20130970"," It's walk the fucking plank. "
"20136320","20137460"," I love Coachella."
"20137480","20138360"," I used to have blast there."
