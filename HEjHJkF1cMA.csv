"HEjHJkF1cMA","0","15000"," Let's see."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","15000","29000"," 9.13."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","29000","33000"," Good morning, Alex. How are you?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","33000","39000"," Move this back a little bit. Bring a little bit closer."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","39000","45000"," Greetings, zero boomer. Guacana. Chaz-dio, Alan, G-chan, Michael."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","45000","50000"," Eric, good morning, Jasmine. Good morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","50000","55000"," Good morning, I lost the toad."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","55000","60000"," All this."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","60000","63000"," How are y'all doing? In light, good morning, Alex."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","63000","66000"," X, good morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","66000","70000"," Jafar, good morning, how are you?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","70000","76000"," All right, so we've got 30 people here. We've got people rolling in. That's good."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","76000","80000"," We're going to have a little small conversation here before the day starts."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","80000","84000"," This is a critical conversation to have."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","85000","92000"," I'm tired here. My phone here, no matter what I do."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","92000","99000"," The alarms are still going off."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","99000","104000"," Maybe it's better to look at a month here."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","104000","111000"," Good morning, everybody. Good morning, Ben. Good morning, CJ, dragon wolf, Alex, Angie, Jess."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","111000","116000"," I need to talk to all of you guys this morning. It's a critical conversation that we're going to have."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","116000","124000"," If you know anybody else out there that wants to hear this or make sure that they get to watch this video at some point this morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","124000","129000"," So we have to talk about something. The runway."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","129000","134000"," We have 40 people here. Good morning, Mary. Good to see you, Sarah. Good to see you."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","134000","140000"," So this is a critical video. This is a pivot video."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","140000","143000"," And we've been talking about this throughout the week."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","143000","153000"," I spoke to you earlier in the week about retail favorite stocks and the volatility that they could encounter as we head into the end of the month."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","153000","160000"," Spock Emma this morning released a note that spoke about these same stocks."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","160000","164000"," So it brought some concern to me today."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","164000","171000"," This morning, you'll probably probably be noticing some weakness in retail favorite stocks, speculative growth stocks."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","171000","184000"," We've touched on it, the possibility that there could be some weakness into the 31st for that tax loss harvesting and then the rolling of hedges as we get closer to the Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","184000","189000"," Now, there's some concern because we've traded sideways and pinned at 478."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","189000","192000"," There's another pin at 480 for Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","192000","196000"," Now, good morning, everybody. Good morning, AK. Good morning, Joe."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","196000","206000"," So just on that same topic that we've been discussing all this week, we did not expand a higher call wall in the market."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","206000","214000"," Now, we should expand that higher call wall. We're looking for that higher call wall today and tomorrow."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","214000","219000"," Right. We're looking for new hedges to come in on the market on the put side."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","219000","223000"," We're looking for new hedges to come into the market on the call side."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","223000","231000"," And I think most of us hope for it to be raised up, right, for the market, for the put hedges to be raised up from the 435, 450s."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","231000","236000"," We want to see a new call wall that's much higher, 505, 20 somewhere in there."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","236000","242000"," Now, with all that taking place between today and Thursday and Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","242000","249000"," And the VIX being as low as it is that we start to get riskier with volatility."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","249000","262000"," Now, that volatility might present itself today. It could get front run today on retail stocks because everyone is expecting it on Friday into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","262000","271000"," So there's risk here. We are in a risky situation here. We could rip higher today and then sell off overnight into Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","271000","278000"," We could rip higher today and Friday and then sell off into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","278000","284000"," We might just sell off right at the bell today, but there is a sell off coming is the point that I'm trying to make to you."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","284000","288000"," It's going to either come today, tomorrow or into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","288000","295000"," So I want you to all be aware of this. The probability of this happening is very high."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","295000","299000"," We've seen it in previous years. We've seen it in previous opexes."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","299000","305000"," Though it is common on Thursdays of an opex for us to rip higher and then sell off down into Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","305000","312000"," You've heard me say on Twitter in the past that you should always expect the Thursday before opex for us to rip higher."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","312000","318000"," So it wouldn't be shocking to see some stocks selling off into Friday. The market in general to rip higher."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","318000","325000"," And then we sell crazy down into Friday. But with so many people knowing this, you don't know if it's going to be front run today."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","325000","336000"," So what does that mean? That means that if your viewpoint is, well, I've got spreads that are good into the next one to three months,"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","336000","343000"," then you should be able to weather whatever sell off is coming."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","343000","353000"," If you're just in naked long positions that are bullish, not bearish, not long inputs or anything like that,"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","354000","361000"," you probably have some concern here and you're going to be starting to play with some fire as we move forward is the point that I'm trying to make."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","361000","369000"," So you should all at least be in hedges or be buying cheap hedges and then rebying them as the week goes on into Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","369000","378000"," Today is not an opex day, but my concern is that if you guys are, let's say you guys are just holding some calls on some stock XYZ stock out there."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","378000","387000"," You're not buying the five center six cent puts to cover yourself or buying some kind of a put spread hedge or buying the VIX, right?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","387000","392000"," You can buy volatility and even if we go up today, you could buy volatility at the end of the day."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","392000","402000"," So I just have some real concern for you out there. If you're an investor or trader, first of all, you should be able to weather if we do have any kind of a pullback."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","402000","406000"," But that you should expect it in the next two, three days."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","406000","418000"," Does everybody understand that out there rates clear on that? So don't want anyone coming back to me today tomorrow or Monday and saying, hey, Cap, you didn't tell me to expect a drop down to 460 or 470."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","418000","424000"," I want you to realize too that we're still in full bullish context. If we drop to 470 50."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","424000","426000"," That's somewhere down in here."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","426000","433000"," You know, in 470 is pretty good area too. If we start breaking below 465, we get in some real danger zone down here."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","434000","440000"," But I want you to think about that as we move forward. We have a pin for Friday that's up here at 480."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","440000","448000"," It's very, very, very reasonable for us to sell down and then hit that 480 tomorrow or for us to go up today, that 480."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","448000","452000"," Maybe we hit it and stay on it overnight and then we sell down into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","452000","460000"," But I just want you to know that as we have one to three days left here in this vicinity here, no matter what happens, there's a high chance at some volatility."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","461000","468000"," At some point, either in the overnight. So if you're long, I wouldn't be holding longs in overnight right now. You could play just day trade."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","468000","477000"," If we start to go higher each day, you could day trade. I would be very wary of holding longs overnight right now."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","477000","482000"," You could see the selldowns come in an illiquid part of the market."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","482000","487000"," And you could also see it into Friday into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","487000","498000"," Is everybody clear in this? If you guys can hammer right now, and if any of you have any questions on understanding this, you could see some selldowns in retail."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","498000","506000"," I don't want to call them meme stocks. It's retail favorite stocks. It encompasses meme stocks, but it also encompasses speculative growth stocks."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","506000","516000"," It encompasses things like SNAP, Square, anything that retail has loved and enjoys, even if it's up."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","516000","522000"," You guys all copying me out there? I can't see any. I see you guys being really quiet right now."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","522000","529000"," And at least in text message, if you guys could text me right now, any questions that you have on this concept."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","529000","538000"," And I want to show you the VIX real quick. Now, this doesn't mean VIX can't drop off this morning more. We could definitely sell VIX down even more."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","538000","545000"," We can easily come down here to 14 down here, no problem."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","545000","553000"," We could sell that. We could straight sell this down, but then shoot up at any point between now and Friday and Saturday or Friday in the Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","553000","562000"," And I just want to make sure that you guys can absorb that kind of a move from this point forward into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","562000","565000"," You guys listening intently? We're all along LOL."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","565000","576000"," You can be long. And to be honest with you, even today, typically on Thursdays before OPEX, typically, not always, but typically, you might have a quick sell-off right at the bell."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","576000","585000"," Like at 9 a.m. we could sell down a little bit, but then we'd have a ripper of a day into clothes and then we'd sell off heavy into Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","585000","590000"," Does that happen with all the mechanics underneath the hood happening today? I'm unsure."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","590000","596000"," The one thing about the mechanics under the hood because it's the quarterly OPEX is you're going to see a lot of movement."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","596000","601000"," You know how you see those jagged moves on OPEX on the normal Friday of OPEX?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","601000","610000"," Because it's quarterly, you might see more of those jagged, incongruent moves and individual tickers from this point into Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","610000","618000"," Also, I want you to be aware, some of you guys out there are tracking the collars that are being put on the market and the hedging that the big hedging that's being put on the market."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","618000","621000"," I want you to pay attention even today, not even Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","621000","623000"," This morning, pay attention to OPEX."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","623000","632000"," You guys can go to the CBO website and find the hedges that are put on OPEX."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","632000","639000"," You'll see some of it possibly on Flow Algo or whatever your favorite Flow software is today, but there is some concern."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","639000","643000"," Myself, I'm long and I've got to straddle on the market right now."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","643000","650000"," I think I'm going to close my lungs this morning and I'm going to just be cashing with the short side that I have."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","650000","652000"," Let's say we rip up today."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","652000","658000"," I'm just going to keep adding some shorts until I can catch this volatility because I think that's coming."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","658000","663000"," I think that's coming the next one to three days and I'm willing to spend some money to catch that ride."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","669000","670000"," It's weird with the VIX."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","670000","673000"," You know what I don't like about the VIX sometimes in these situations?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","673000","679000"," For where we are right now, it's hard sometimes to trade the VIX."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","679000","684000"," It's not always hard to trade the VIX, but it's so fast with the VIX."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","684000","690000"," Let's say it happens in the overnight and you get that spike up and then you don't sell out of it quick enough."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","690000","692000"," You could buy the VIX though."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","692000","694000"," I do like buying the VIX when it gets low."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","694000","696000"," I was going to buy the VIX today."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","696000","703000"," I'd still be looking for us to go up today at some point between today and Friday and for that big rip."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","703000","706000"," I still want to see the VIX come down a little bit more."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","706000","708000"," You ever notice when you try to buy the VIX?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","708000","713000"," I'm going to buy the VIX where it's almost at 17 right now and then it dumps a little bit more."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","713000","719000"," You missed that last little capitulation in the VIX."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","719000","725000"," I often times will buy the VIX at the wrong time."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","725000","727000"," I'm looking for that one last rip."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","727000","730000"," I'm looking for that 4,800 pin."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","730000","732000"," I don't know if it happens today."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","732000","734000"," I don't know if it happens on Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","734000","741000"," We could trade sideways today, rip up to pin that 8,400, but then sell down into Friday and Monday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","741000","746000"," I'm still not quite sold in this taking place right at open today unless it's front run."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","746000","749000"," But I think it's better for me or for my trading style."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","749000","753000"," What I think I'm going to do is I'm just going to be looking for more cheap puts."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","753000","757000"," 8 cheap puts that I can add at like $0.10, $0.20, $0.30."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","757000","766000"," If I spend anywhere from $0.10 to $0.30 each day and I end up being all in for $1 and we have a volatility spike,"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","766000","771000"," then that $1 that I spent will still cover me to $2, $3, $4."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","771000","773000"," I'll still make $3, $400."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","773000","776000"," I'll still make $3, $400."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","776000","778000"," Yeah, MU is getting hurt this morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","778000","783000"," You saw the, I was watching CNBC at like 4 o'clock this morning, 5 o'clock this morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","783000","793000"," They rolled out some bullshit that because of the new Decepticon virus that they're going to have chip shortages."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","793000","795000"," That was the story that was rolled out this morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","795000","797000"," That was kind of fun."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","797000","799000"," My MU, you could hold on."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","799000","806000"," I would think that MU is going to be weak for moments, but the nearest call, the nearest day that calls expire on,"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","806000","810000"," and when do the next call calls expire on MU?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","810000","811000"," I think it's it."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","811000","818000"," I can't bring up my, if I bring up my brokerage share, you guys will see my login credentials and I can't show that on TV."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","818000","821000"," But I need you guys to understand that because let's look at, I want to show you a few things."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","821000","828000"," I want to show you that this morning, GameStop's week, AMC's week, NVIDIA's week, Tesla's week, Arcade's week,"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","828000","832000"," Slightly, Hood's Slightly week, and MU's week a lot."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","832000","835000"," And some of these are mentioned by SG this morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","835000","838000"," And also, it's not just these names."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","838000","841000"," I'm assuming that if I brought up like SQ."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","841000","844000"," Yeah, so SQ is weak."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","844000","846000"," I mean, you could probably just rattle these off."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","846000","852000"," Any stocks okay that are retail favorites?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","852000","855000"," There's a chance of high volatility."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","855000","858000"," High volatility in these stocks in the next two days."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","858000","860000"," And some of that has to do with the roll in hedging."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","860000","863000"," Some of it has to do with hedges coming off to."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","863000","868000"," And some of these stocks, you'll see that sometimes when you see shorting, active shorting of stocks,"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","868000","872000"," there'll be that last little bit of capitulation to just dump them down as hard as they can."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","873000","874000"," Excuse me."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","874000","875000"," Hard as they can."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","875000","879000"," Even myself, I was looking for, I'm looking for hood, let's say, for me personally."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","879000","889000"," So we talked yesterday about hood and I was saying to you that I'm hoping that there's that last moment of hood selling down to $15, $10, heading into Friday."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","889000","890000"," Right?"
"HEjHJkF1cMA","890000","893000"," And so SG was talking about that this morning."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","893000","899000"," And we were talking about that yesterday because that could happen on a lot of our favorite stocks in the coming two days."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","900000","907000"," And if they're reporting it this morning on their daily brief or their daily notes, then you know it's getting broadcast out to a bunch of different people in the market."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","907000","909000"," And then that brings on front running."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","909000","917000"," That brings on me talking to you, you talking to your friends, brings on other people out there talking to all their friends, and everybody starts to panic."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","917000","920000"," So it introduces a little bit of panic into the market."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","920000","926000"," Some front running of trying to sell down their positions and gain max profit by banks."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","926000","929000"," So whether that manifests itself today or not, I'm unsure."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","929000","931000"," But we'll know about that right now at the bell."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","931000","933000"," So I'll go back to Spy real quick."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","933000","935000"," We'll check out what happens to spy in the bell."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","935000","941000"," I'm interested because sometimes on Thursdays, what we'll do is have a quick sell down and then we have a ripper of a day."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","941000","944000"," So we'll do this together right now."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","944000","946000"," We're coming into it's 929."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","946000","950000"," We've got 35 seconds left until the bell."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","950000","952000"," And I'll put it on the five day."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","953000","959000"," Just so you guys can see you're by the dip down here is 4750 right here."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","959000","962000"," This is actually this is actually by the F and dip."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","966000","972000"," Somewhere down in here if we dip below this level down here, this is not good for the market."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","972000","973000"," Okay."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","974000","978000"," And see if I can bring this."
"HEjHJkF1cMA","979000","982000"," Slightly lower."
