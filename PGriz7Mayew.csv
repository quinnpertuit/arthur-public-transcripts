"37680","38660"," Check one, two, baby."
"40920","42160"," That's a little loud, isn't it?"
"75580","76320"," Good morning."
"80610","81610"," Let's get right into it. "
"81650","82310"," We gotta get moving here."
"119940","122760"," That's the cues they probably want to look at today, too, right?"
"124020","124980"," And WM."
"133500","144850"," Let's get right into"
"144850","145270"," it this morning. "
"145470","146750"," Good morning to all of you out there."
"148670","151210"," Let me just say I'm going to make sure that everything lined up here."
"151790","153330"," We're in a little bit late this morning. "
"153330","162850"," I was trying to sleep in this morning because I was trying to short the market last night."
"163590","165950"," I was up until like 1.30 in the morning, 1 o'clock."
"166130","168250"," I think it was 1.30 in the morning. "
"169110","172470"," I was trying to short the market last night, and I got so tired."
"172610","173250"," I just fell asleep."
"173470","174070"," What did fall asleep?"
"174250","175250"," I was like, I ain't waiting for this. "
"176070","180710"," And then I woke up this morning and I'm like, it started dropping finally."
"181010","185470"," When I went to bed last night, Quinn was like, I'm going to bed."
"185770","187210"," I'm like, okay, I'm going to bed, too. "
"188470","191590"," So I wasn't able to actually short the market last night."
"191650","192690"," I'm kind of pissed off about it."
"192770","193450"," Just traded sideways. "
"194470","196170"," And eventually the hourly trigger came down."
"196310","197630"," We finally dropped in the overnight."
"202030","203590"," Just a second here so I can get ready here. "
"208480","209080"," Good morning."
"209200","209920"," How y'all doing out there?"
"210440","216420"," So I did miss the short, not sure about the selling last night."
"217560","219160"," It was a week on. "
"219880","222140"," I was awake the day, the night before."
"223160","224540"," And I made some money that night."
"224820","227300"," And then the last night I'm like, fuck this. "
"227580","230680"," I haven't slept in like 36 hours or 48 hours."
"231600","234080"," Like Sunday was dead and then Monday was good."
"235680","238220"," And then Tuesday and Wednesday I was like, hell no. "
"241750","243450"," To go around and I'll be all of you guys out there."
"243510","243910"," How's everybody doing?"
"244310","246170"," And I had a lot of those on last night."
"246510","247450"," They're getting torched. "
"247570","249090"," So I think I bought them at 18 cents."
"249410","251170"," They're at 18 or 20 cents."
"251610","253130"," They're at 4 cents right now. "
"253610","255589"," So I'm like, oh shit, those are gone too."
"259790","262010"," So we're sitting at the daily trigger."
"262110","266670"," Let's give you a quick, fast market overview and update here, right?"
"267610","272990"," I haven't put the hourly trigger here yet either because that came down in the overnight. "
"273150","273910"," Is that 4?"
"273910","278890"," 4 15, 4 15, 33."
"280890","283270"," So that came flying down last night too."
"283390","285050"," I was waiting for this to come down last night. "
"285310","286290"," Couldn't get it to come down."
"289590","292410"," I did a bunch of work on the discord last night too."
"292510","293730"," We'll talk about the discord today. "
"295370","298790"," And so we're having like a token theft."
"300170","302810"," So what happens in this token theft thing is."
"307290","308570"," 15, 27. "
"313160","314280"," That's for you guys."
"315660","318400"," What happens on token theft is."
"327840","329000"," A scammer. "
"329100","331720"," Well, they do this on YouTube and on discord."
"332760","335660"," It's like they're it's like they're they're emo right now."
"335800","339720"," So what they'll do is they'll they'll create a clone of a moderator. "
"342720","347300"," And they will like they make a clone and then the moderator, let's say, will send me a DM."
"348660","350880"," And they'll and it seems very innocuous."
"351060","352200"," You don't always check. "
"353960","359720"," You'll get a DM saying something like, Hey, can you do this or Hey, can you do that."
"361800","364280"," And or can you look at the let's say this cap?"
"364460","365680"," Can you look at this bot for me?"
"366120","367100"," Click through and check this bot?"
"367100","373660"," And of course, like the labeling is an innocuous and how they get to is you automatically assume"
"373660","374520"," it's someone that you know."
"375140","380400"," It's not like it's a DM from an unknown person or someone trying to be your friend. "
"381480","382660"," Any of that kind of stuff."
"382780","387160"," It's someone that you think you think closely of an admin, a moderator, stuff like that."
"387600","389000"," Same happens on YouTube. "
"390140","395400"," So I'll click through that link and then the the logger infects my computer."
"396300","400360"," From there, you call them the keys to the castle, right?"
"400500","403520"," So if you have like Discord or YouTube or Twitch."
"404580","408900"," You have these keys and they're kind of like these secret things, right?"
"409400","415320"," The next time that I log into YouTube, log out or in or log out or in or discord, they"
"415320","416880"," now have a copy of the keys. "
"417440","421600"," They go in, log me out and they re log back in and change the key."
"422240","424020"," And they hijack your server."
"424260","425740"," They hijack your YouTube channel. "
"426740","432800"," And that's basically what's going on inside of our discord."
"433360","435420"," It just happened recently to."
"438180","438900"," What's his name?"
"439000","441220"," I forget his name right now, Linus Tech. "
"442540","446080"," Through one of his moderators, it started there and then it started infecting their fucking"
"446080","447240"," computers and all that kind of shit."
"447360","448580"," They're on the same network and that was it."
"448580","449620"," It was over. "
"449960","453900"," Matter of fact, that's when you see the Elon YouTube videos, YouTube live streams."
"454880","458380"," From from from high follow accounts and you're like, Oh, there's you."
"458900","459520"," Elon's up. "
"460080","462120"," You like, there's a million people watching right now."
"462140","463040"," They've got a million followers."
"463180","466580"," That's a hijacked of account on YouTube. "
"468480","470400"," So we're dealing with that right now in the background."
"470580","472760"," So I was up doing that crap last night as well."
"476950","477350"," Okay. "
"477670","481630"," So on this open right here, we're going to we're going to look back to Friday."
"481950","482150"," Okay."
"482710","488870"," So if you go back into Friday's live stream, there were a few points that I made to you on"
"488870","489830"," Friday's live stream. "
"493480","497120"," We're going to look at we're going to look specifically at Friday's live stream."
"497220","498900"," We're going to talk to you guys about Friday's live stream."
"504680","508580"," So during Friday's live stream, we were coming down. "
"508820","510680"," This is where the hourly trigger was."
"510880","511320"," Oh, shit."
"511500","514620"," We're going to start the day off with this. "
"518179","519080"," Just say in here."
"527730","529170"," So on Friday's live stream."
"530470","531850"," This is where the early was. "
"531870","533530"," We came back down and checked it, right?"
"534210","538950"," And just before we went up here, I had said to you, we're going to enter this trade here."
"539170","540510"," We're going to get out of this trade here."
"540750","548330"," And we're going to get the comments in the chat will ask, should I buy here, right?"
"549090","553450"," And we're going to say, no, we're going to exit up here before we get there, right?"
"553910","558310"," So we actually did exit here and people were asking in the chat here. "
"558810","560450"," Should I get long for 430?"
"561170","564890"," We actually did still get those bulls asking us, do you get long there?"
"564890","571730"," Now, we did buy some, we did throw some profit in here for one more squeeze higher into the"
"571730","573290"," following day, but it was dirt cheap."
"573430","575110"," It was like 30 cents or something like that."
"575450","579710"," We actually got paid, I think, I think we paid 60 cents or something like that. "
"579770","582550"," We got paid on this trade to go over."
"582690","589350"," But even so, as we had come into doing it, the dates right here are the dates wrong or like"
"589350","590210"," the days wrong."
"590210","592430"," Yeah, so we can't, yeah, exactly. "
"592610","594410"," So we came in a Friday right here this Thursday."
"595050","601090"," As we came into Friday here and we were exiting, as we were exiting on Friday, we had spoken about"
"601090","608310"," making, having a cooling off period down into Wednesday."
"609510","613370"," Now, I didn't expect this to roll over yesterday. "
"613410","615650"," I was expecting this to roll over today."
"615770","616790"," You can see it right here."
"616790","624690"," I was expecting us to trade down into this zone right here and then have your capitulation move for"
"624690","626770"," the Fed minutes. "
"626770","631670"," Like panic, we talked about this on, I believe, Friday or Monday."
"631890","637290"," Whenever this started here, like on this date, we started talking about setting this up for"
"637290","640470"," capitulation into the Fed minutes, right?"
"640870","645490"," Bad news, bad news, no pause, rate hike 50 BPS."
"645490","647690"," We got it a day early here. "
"647830","649610"," I'm not really too concerned with this."
"649790","653430"," I did send some people over the weekend."
"653430","660670"," I sent some people this target down here and it actually was for the 23rd. "
"660930","665490"," So any of you out there that got that email over the weekend, if you're watching this broadcast, it"
"665490","667950"," actually was for the 23rd, not the 24th."
"668910","672850"," So it's a day early, but at the same time, we kind of knew going in."
"672990","674830"," I sent you a chart in DMs, I think. "
"675170","680550"," I think I sent it to Joe Donut and Jay Roll, a bunch of other people."
"681110","687430"," I kind of expect this move down into Tuesday, not Wednesday, but either way, whether we got it"
"687430","689910"," yesterday or today really isn't important."
"691090","697210"," But that we did get that volatility we were looking for, we did get the pullback that we were"
"697210","697790"," looking for. "
"698750","704890"," What's fascinating is that coming down here, there's some notes to make about this move down."
"705570","710750"," The first of which is on market breath, you guys, I know you guys check market breath in the"
"710750","710990"," background."
"711230","715770"," I'm going to look at it right now because the data wasn't out yet this morning. "
"715770","719790"," So I was waiting for it before the open this morning and the data hadn't been out yet."
"719810","720830"," I wanted to see it."
"723190","724970"," I wanted to see market breath. "
"725210","726970"," So I'm going to show you guys some of this stuff briefly."
"727810","732910"," We got time here, we shouldn't, we shouldn't see too much death and destruction, that kind of"
"732910","733190"," stuff."
"738960","741020"," The second here, I'll bring this stuff over for you. "
"748740","750840"," So we're still down here, right?"
"750980","757460"," We've got 35, we've got 33.6% on market breath, right?"
"758380","761460"," Price has not followed breath down at this point."
"762980","767000"," And even on zigzag channels, we're still in an upward trend."
"767520","771620"," I do want you to see that we're still an upward trend here. "
"771840","772720"," Nothing has changed."
"773480","775720"," These dips have all been bought here."
"775880","778620"," One, two, three back here. "
"778760","781080"," This goes all the way back to October, believe it or not."
"782140","786420"," And so even with the panic that's in the market right now, price hasn't followed."
"786600","793660"," And that's a key point is that even as breath goes down here, there's some risk here to a full"
"793660","794300"," liquidation. "
"794900","799800"," But even with that full liquidation, if we were in a bear market, you would have seen price already"
"799800","801180"," down here."
"801180","803220"," Let's say at 400, maybe even 395."
"804180","805680"," And then you'd see the liquidation. "
"806080","806580"," Does that make sense?"
"806760","811500"," You just see that bloodbath that you're looking for if you're a bear, your collapse bear, crash"
"811500","811940"," bear."
"812980","814400"," Because FCX is down."
"814780","817080"," We're going to take a look at FCX and copper this morning as well. "
"817860","820000"," And I know that you're being pumped full of stuff."
"820460","824680"," I told tell you that sometimes I watch CNN and see what they're telling people."
"825280","829720"," I want to see what they're telling Bob on Main Street and Sue on Main Street. "
"829720","831400"," And they were like, everything is fine."
"831640","834720"," But then yesterday, they got real like bearish."
"834820","839960"," They were like, oh, by the way, if we get a debt ceiling fix, the market is in doom as"
"839960","840140"," well. "
"840140","843120"," And they weren't saying that up into yesterday."
"844140","848880"," Another thing that we noticed yesterday was that they were closing puts in the money."
"849460","855380"," We also noticed that with the first time in weeks, we had double the normal zero date puts come"
"855380","855880"," into the market. "
"855880","865020"," Normally, it's like 200,000 300,000 yesterday, zero dates maxed out like five, 30, 540,000 zero"
"865020","866860"," date puts that closed in the money."
"867020","870180"," Those are all like key points indicators that you want to be watching."
"872060","875560"," On a weekly here, weekly timeframe, I just want you to see this briefly. "
"879150","880810"," On a weekly basis here."
"882550","884090"," They can get rid of this for a minute."
"886350","889170"," You can see right here to do want to show you this. "
"889570","894090"," So when we get these capitulation moves, you can see one right there, right?"
"894250","897670"," You can see one right there and we're kind of heading towards that right now."
"898310","900730"," So we're going to be looking for that as we head higher."
"901050","903030"," Is that at that 400 down here?"
"903170","903730"," Does that make sense?"
"903950","905910"," Do you see that breath on the weekly?"
"906890","910850"," And we have not rolled over at this point as well, right?"
"910850","913530"," We're still climbing here as well this morning. "
"916820","918560"," Right on right on, baby."
"919000","919460"," I see that."
"919580","920480"," I see that tweet. "
"921040","921980"," I see that text."
"925220","927940"," So I got we've been blown up by a good friend of mine."
"931220","933200"," So just on weekly here too. "
"933360","935820"," I want to show you something else on weekly trend here."
"936620","938540"," You guys get panicked out there."
"941440","945080"," Just on weekly, we fought down in this double bottom down here. "
"945820","948000"," We're coming above right here in PPO."
"949060","953160"," And we don't normally see when we on a weekly basis, we come up on PPO."
"953720","956700"," We don't see like that major crash to the downside. "
"957180","957780"," Does that make sense?"
"958800","960660"," We had a big major bottom here in COVID."
"960840","963120"," We had a major bottom here on PPO."
"963840","967400"," And we're leveling up, but we're not we don't we don't see this historical. "
"967400","972400"," It's very rare that we see this in previous history."
"972460","973840"," You see this double bottom back here."
"973940","974500"," This is 2015. "
"975780","977920"," You can see this major one in 2011."
"978640","984580"," We had a failure back in 2008 to get above, but we actually are above right now."
"985100","989940"," So there are some major differences even in 2008 to today is my point to you. "
"990340","993260"," So can you be bearish here on the spy?"
"993840","994740"," Hell yeah, you can."
"994740","997160"," Can you be like, Hey, let's see what happens."
"997160","998400"," Is there a reaction here?"
"998760","1003520"," And we're going to be looking for a reaction to the upside and then a failure. "
"1003800","1005380"," If we are going to crash."
"1006040","1009120"," So before you get all freaked out and be like, Oh my God, I was panicky."
"1009120","1009760"," Is that possible?"
"1010000","1010980"," Can right?"
"1011360","1014640"," He does that dip get bought and then you get the rejection to the downside. "
"1015240","1019860"," Or is it like, Oh yeah, you know, doom and China and all this other stuff is over and right"
"1019860","1022920"," back into testing those highs again."
"1023800","1025740"," So it's kind of like one of those places, right?"
"1026060","1029020"," I don't know why I'm getting beat right now."
"1030339","1031240"," Please stop this. "
"1031380","1031540"," Please."
"1031819","1033960"," Whoever's out there sending me text messages right now."
"1034160","1037660"," Like I get like yesterday, every day, I get like hundreds of texts. "
"1038079","1039839"," If they're critical, I want to see them."
"1039940","1043240"," But if not, I can't look at them because they're kind of disruptive."
"1044300","1045940"," So just on spy right now, right?"
"1046640","1047319"," Just on spy. "
"1047900","1049560"," I don't see anything bearish."
"1049560","1055440"," And when news comes out, I'm usually looking for, Hey, where we are in price and what is the news?"
"1055860","1057040"," I want to know what the news is."
"1057120","1059460"," I want to know what the prices have those moments. "
"1059700","1060960"," Are we at a high or at a low?"
"1061740","1064400"," And what is the actual news being fed to you or told you?"
"1067100","1067880"," Does it make sense?"
"1069300","1071100"," Let me be a second here."
"1088010","1089210"," Just one second here."
"1123570","1124770"," Oh, it's something that's out. "
"1144130","1145090"," Hold on a second here."
"1146010","1147030"," Got a little bit of a."
"1148250","1151330"," Been drinking some some coffee this morning trying to stay away."
"1153770","1159870"," Another point here is we know and we've always known the past few weeks that the daily breath has"
"1159870","1160690"," been coming down. "
"1160690","1165650"," We always talk about when is the safest best time to buy the market?"
"1166450","1168770"," And these we actually made these check marks."
"1168770","1171370"," If you look at these check marks right here, like when do you buy the market?"
"1171790","1174010"," We did a whole segment on this stuff, right?"
"1174610","1178570"," When daily daily breath or not breath, but velocity is all the way to the downside."
"1179550","1181930"," It's safe to buy that dip, right?"
"1182090","1184930"," So we're safe to buy that dip once or below. "
"1185170","1187230"," We have one, two, three."
"1187230","1189710"," This goes actually back even in the bear market of 2022."
"1190230","1192210"," Whenever we're down here, you buy this dip. "
"1192690","1197010"," As a matter of fact, a close friend of the program, you know, you know, James Rowland."
"1198070","1204790"," One of the reasons him and I became friends was because in the dirty, dark depths of the bear"
"1204790","1205710"," market of 2022."
"1206890","1211390"," There would be a cacophony of major crash, major crash, major crash. "
"1212430","1218150"," And there was a different story being told at each bottom, even as we stepped down."
"1218450","1220850"," So you might be like, I'm not short."
"1221010","1221450"," I'm not short. "
"1221630","1222830"," And then I want to get short."
"1223470","1225610"," And then that's the moment where you shouldn't be short."
"1225650","1229550"," You want to you want to wait until we get a rip higher and then get short when we're max"
"1229550","1231290"," bullishness, right?"
"1231450","1232690"," We're max bullishness up here. "
"1232770","1238390"," And when we're starting to come down here into this velocity, we're looking for a dip to buy,"
"1238410","1238710"," right?"
"1238710","1240810"," And we're starting to get there right now."
"1240930","1242050"," We're not quite there."
"1242550","1244330"," You can see right here on the right hand side. "
"1244470","1249290"," We're not that velocity on the daily is not max bearishness yet."
"1249330","1256650"," We're looking for it to get down somewhere minus 25 minus 50 somewhere in there for the safety by,"
"1256990","1257830"," right?"
"1258270","1263590"," You hear in the news, you hear in the news that all these old fat white guys have been sitting"
"1263590","1264250"," at their desks."
"1264250","1266130"," They haven't had a buy in, right?"
"1266490","1268270"," They didn't buy in October. "
"1268490","1269470"," They didn't buy in December."
"1269670","1270790"," They didn't buy in March."
"1271530","1275530"," And all they want to do is put money into the market to make it work. "
"1276150","1277130"," And they're crying, right?"
"1277270","1279290"," They're actually crying on the news."
"1279790","1280630"," I want to buy in."
"1281330","1282990"," I didn't get a buy in. "
"1284010","1289610"," Another thing that we can notice is the separation of price above the daily, the weekly, and the"
"1289610","1289850"," monthly."
"1290450","1294110"," These are all signs of a normalization of markets here."
"1294430","1295990"," I've shown you this in the past. "
"1296590","1301910"," Whenever you see something like this, it's a return to normalization, not a return to panic, a"
"1301910","1305950"," return to normalizing markets."
"1306990","1314170"," If you were to begin to see price cross below and the daily begin to cross below the weekly or"
"1314170","1316270"," the monthly, you would then go into panic mode."
"1316270","1319350"," Hey, we're confirming we're going back into a bear market. "
"1319850","1321310"," It's going to be panic time."
"1321790","1324790"," We have examples of this in the past."
"1325290","1330670"," I'll show you the example right now from 2021 or 2022 when that happened. "
"1331850","1335130"," I'm going to show it to you right now so you can see it as it happens."
"1336110","1339570"," This is January, excuse me, of 2022."
"1339850","1344130"," You watch price get underneath the daily, right?"
"1344130","1348850"," Trades below the daily and fails to get back above the daily, right?"
"1349010","1350270"," So this is what you want to be looking for. "
"1350870","1352630"," Right here where we are."
"1352830","1353690"," Wait, it'll look at this."
"1355770","1358410"," Right here where you are where we are, right?"
"1358550","1360930"," We come down to the daily, right?"
"1361370","1362050"," We break down. "
"1362390","1364250"," We have a failure to get above, right?"
"1364670","1368510"," Then we break below the weekly and you watch the daily come back down."
"1368510","1370310"," We got to grab some more liquidity to the downside."
"1370610","1375610"," And this is where you're getting confirmed here that it's abnormal action in the market, right?"
"1376250","1381670"," You can see in previous examples, price always recovers on the daily. "
"1382290","1385210"," Sometimes makes a move down to the weekly, right?"
"1385430","1387490"," But always recovers, right?"
"1388070","1388090"," Always."
"1388510","1394370"," So if we're in a normalized market, we should see only two things."
"1394370","1398370"," We should see today a recovery, not today, tomorrow, whatever. "
"1399050","1408850"," We should see a recovery from 40461 or 41197 and a continuation"
"1408850","1409790"," to the upside."
"1410810","1411450"," Does that make sense?"
"1412570","1416110"," So if you're like Supermax bearish, what are you looking for?"
"1416110","1421770"," You're looking for, if you're like Supermax bearish, you're like China, I just got a phone call"
"1421770","1422090"," this morning."
"1422190","1426530"," If someone's like, you're talking about China again, they're talking about lockdowns, 70 million"
"1426530","1428470"," people being locked down every day. "
"1429170","1433550"," You're looking for price to go underneath, right?"
"1433870","1436490"," Oh, let me get a better green or something."
"1438910","1445370"," You're looking for price to get underneath, close underneath the daily, right?"
"1445370","1449690"," And reject, like a failure to regain itself, right?"
"1451010","1455510"," We're even actually fine hitting this weekly here, right?"
"1455650","1459590"," But you'd want to see us break below it and watch this daily come down."
"1460090","1460950"," Does that make sense?"
"1461490","1464970"," Even if we get one more squeeze higher than a rollover, you're going to be looking for this,"
"1465490","1467970"," looking for specifically this daily. "
"1469870","1471030"," Change this color back."
"1476760","1479120"," You're going to be specifically, damn it, that's not yellow."
"1482520","1483580"," I guess that's yellow. "
"1484560","1489080"," Specifically for this yellow to cross this green line over, you get the point that I'm trying to"
"1489080","1489460"," make, right?"
"1490420","1495900"," And even if we do this here, you're going to see violent moves to the upside and violent failures."
"1496980","1501640"," You'll see a violent failure on this yellow and you'll see a violent failure on this orange."
"1501640","1511600"," Now, another key point here is even if we trade down to 404, you wouldn't likely see this yellow"
"1511600","1516260"," cross down unless we start getting really, really nasty, really volatile, right?"
"1516760","1518380"," You can actually see it right here. "
"1518920","1520440"," We didn't see a cross there, did we?"
"1520720","1526980"," We didn't see that nasty cross that we saw in January, in January of 2022."
"1527600","1531080"," We saw the continuation, separation of the weekly and daily."
"1531540","1532360"," Why is that?"
"1532560","1537340"," It's because we're not seeing price following breath on the way down. "
"1537860","1544080"," We're not seeing, like, so right now with where breath is, if we were at like 395 today, you would"
"1544080","1547560"," see that yellow line just go, it would go fucking vertical to the downside."
"1549540","1554820"," Okay, so just to the downside, right now, 404, 28 is what I'm looking for."
"1555260","1560540"," If we can close below the daily on 412.08. I'm not panicked here. "
"1560620","1561380"," Personally, I'm not panicked."
"1561540","1562880"," I'm just looking for a dip to buy at this point."
"1563280","1563920"," I'll be honest with you. "
"1563980","1564640"," That's what I'm looking for."
"1565340","1569620"," This has worked itself going all the way back to October."
"1570720","1572460"," Look all the way back into October. "
"1573660","1574840"," We break below here, right?"
"1574840","1576600"," Tagged it, tagged it."
"1576740","1580440"," We had a little bit of this nastiness here, but that was still a time to buy."
"1581040","1584840"," Even all the drama and craziness down there still the time to buy. "
"1585340","1590760"," And even right now, as we get bearish here and people are freaking out, I'm looking for this by"
"1590760","1591860"," down below."
"1592640","1596040"," Now with that being said, FCX."
"1598240","1601140"," We're going to look at FCX right here, right?"
"1601140","1604240"," And this is kind of like the crash indicator in the background. "
"1604240","1607320"," It's one of the copper analogs, right?"
"1607500","1613500"," We're seeing the monthly here above at $34.78. And I want you to pay attention to this."
"1613640","1615140"," Okay, get your notepads out."
"1615960","1617780"," Get your notepads out. "
"1618560","1620780"," And we're going to look back historically on this."
"1621780","1626920"," What I'm fearful of here, what I don't want to see here is I don't want to see the capitulation"
"1626920","1627600"," in FCX."
"1628480","1630240"," Let's say blood baths down here. "
"1630480","1635100"," And I don't want to see that failure above at $35, right?"
"1635260","1644160"," We got $35, $36.50. And I believe $37, $38, flat."
"1644740","1651300"," So you want to be paying attention to this over the next week or so into Monday or stuff like"
"1651300","1651500"," that."
"1651580","1654720"," We don't want to see that capitulation. "
"1655580","1657660"," I'm going to show you the failure back here."
"1658880","1662140"," Any of this kind of stuff up here, bad news, right?"
"1662340","1668500"," Failure to capitulation rejection there to the downside for that major leg down."
"1668600","1670880"," If you're looking for that major leg down, I want you to see it right here. "
"1671120","1674000"," Boom, right on that monthly, we start bloodbathings."
"1674160","1678820"," So right where we are right now, if you see a rejection, tell you bloodbath down to $30."
"1679780","1682400"," We come back up and we start rejecting that monthly. "
"1682400","1686000"," That's where we're going to get our next leg down in the stock in the stock market."
"1686640","1688320"," So pay attention to this $35."
"1688740","1693700"," That's really what I'm really, this is really like the tell in the background. "
"1694580","1700420"," If we start to have a relief rally and we fail $35 on FCX, no bueno."
"1701080","1707040"," So keep your eyes on FCX coming into the next, I'd say, into Monday or so."
"1707600","1709620"," I'm trading $33.47 right now. "
"1710040","1711360"," I don't care if it goes to $30."
"1711640","1713040"," I care about this."
"1713920","1717400"," This is what my fear is only entertained. "
"1718640","1722960"," I said $35, I think it's $35.5 somewhere in there."
"1723820","1725300"," But I don't want to see that failure."
"1725500","1730440"," If I see that failure right there, bloodbath it, come back up and we see this one right here. "
"1730480","1732360"," This one's like skull and crossbones."
"1733140","1735200"," Do not want to see that failure."
"1736180","1738040"," On that retest to the upside. "
"1738360","1742560"," This is like the bad boy right here where you get real nasty here."
"1742980","1748320"," If you feel like you've missed, the crash has happened or it's already started."
"1749040","1753560"," You're one of those kind of like, you're like one of those kind of like bears or whatever. "
"1753880","1755720"," I want to also let you know something."
"1756900","1759500"," Then go to a spa here in a blank chart."
"1769760","1770720"," Daily here. "
"1779920","1782220"," Now these always look so horrible in this chart."
"1782260","1783320"," These look like dog shit."
"1783420","1783740"," That's ES. "
"1785780","1788320"," Like trading views charts just kind of suck."
"1789740","1790340"," What is that?"
"1793980","1795140"," Cleaner on SPX."
"1796620","1800420"," It looks so horrible, doesn't it?"
"1802460","1806430"," I want you to see the difference here. "
"1807670","1809130"," This is a daily chart."
"1810050","1816210"," I want you to be keeping your eyes focused on a cross, a bear plane on the daily."
"1817350","1820130"," This is going to signal your crash. "
"1820590","1822590"," We don't have that right now, do we over here?"
"1823310","1824050"," Not here."
"1824290","1825790"," Do you see the cross over here?"
"1826250","1826650"," I don't."
"1827490","1829430"," We had a little bit of a cross right here. "
"1830390","1831150"," A price recovered."
"1831910","1836510"," What you want to really see is price fail here and still reject to the downside."
"1837270","1841070"," Watch these, the white and the red crawl over that kind of stuff. "
"1841730","1844670"," You still have time here if you're a crash bear."
"1844750","1851470"," My point here is if you're a crash bear, you still have like days, weeks before you get a confirmed"
"1851470","1851750"," crash."
"1852750","1853770"," That would be right here. "
"1857230","1859770"," Days and weeks, believe it or not."
"1860430","1862510"," You would see price come back down below."
"1864010","1865190"," Come down below here. "
"1866090","1870330"," And it would even make an attempt every time would make an attempt."
"1870470","1873010"," And then that's where you get the money trade down in there."
"1873310","1879630"," So right down there, you're looking for like that 3,600, 3,200, 2,800, 80, that kind of stuff. "
"1880110","1881290"," You're looking for a failure."
"1881490","1888090"," And that failure is up here at like 404, 405 on a capitulation, face ripper, whatever."
"1888730","1893670"," Do you remember those numbers that 404 number that I was talking to you about earlier, right?"
"1894050","1896050"," I just showed that to you out somewhere else. "
"1896490","1898370"," I said, oh, that 404 number."
"1901110","1904050"," I was like that 404 is special, right?"
"1904230","1905970"," That 404 is an important level."
"1907050","1908050"," A second here. "
"1934680","1936040"," Why am I always on that?"
"1958530","1963450"," So I just I just showed you that 404 rejection, that kind of stuff, right?"
"1963610","1969770"," If you're a if you are a crash bear, it's not good enough getting down here."
"1969870","1972710"," You need that break of what 404."
"1972710","1978710"," And then when you get that break of 404, you're going to get your bloodbath down to 396. "
"1979730","1983910"," You're going to look for a capitulation, squeeze higher, whatever you want to call it."
"1984430","1986950"," And then that's your trigger for crash right there."
"1987790","1993670"," Close below 404 and a rejection on any kind of a bounce here at 404. "
"1994090","1995070"," That's where we get our crash."
"1995070","2003370"," If you miss this trade down in any way, shape or form, you're looking for a break below 404 and"
"2003370","2008050"," a rejection at 404 to start getting super duper bearish down there."
"2008770","2016910"," Like 404, 404 is the magic number to break, close underneath, look for a major capitulation, and"
"2016910","2018870"," then look for a failure to trade higher. "
"2019530","2022990"," And that would be the FCX trade back up to 35 on the spot."
"2035770","2039110"," VIX, VIX trading up to its weekly trigger right now."
"2039350","2043170"," We were looking yesterday for 19 others, 1991 or something. "
"2043890","2047750"," We're now breaking above the $20 mark on VIX."
"2048250","2054409"," Next stop above on VIX is $22.89. We reviewed this yesterday as well."
"2055070","2061090"," We're going to see if we can get this up to that $22.87, $22.89 on the VIX. "
"2061590","2064290"," That should put us down at that 404."
"2065630","2067710"," So we're going to now put the 404 down."
"2067770","2068929"," Well, we already have it down here. "
"2069530","2071050"," We've been looking for it for a couple of weeks now."
"2072270","2073270"," We're going to bring it over."
"2074670","2076389"," There it is right there. "
"2077389","2078510"," There's your weekly trigger."
"2081510","2083489"," It's a magic number down here."
"2083590","2084230"," This is the weekly. "
"2087409","2088969"," This is what the bears want."
"2089330","2090190"," They don't want the weekly."
"2091210","2098570"," They want to trade underneath the weekly and close under the weekly to go down, right?"
"2098770","2101130"," They want to blast down here, close this gap down below. "
"2101450","2102230"," And then they want a failure."
"2102670","2103810"," This is like the key right here."
"2104470","2109450"," Key is closing below and rejecting below that weekly trigger. "
"2110130","2114210"," And that's where you're going to get your crash pants on or your crash pants."
"2114210","2116390"," You're going to get your crash helmets if you're a bull and any of that kind of stuff."
"2132200","2132880"," One second here. "
"2132900","2134200"," I got a bunch of text that I had this morning."
"2134700","2135920"," I got to read one of them."
"2136100","2137760"," The first person that texted me this morning, hold on. "
"2159380","2160600"," Let me just one second here."
"2174370","2176510"," Let me see if I can get the weekly exact price for you."
"2176610","2176750"," Hold on. "
"2286430","2286830"," All right."
"2286950","2289010"," So you guys are saying inside the check."
"2290170","2291110"," Good morning to all of you, by the way. "

"2425640","2426960"," I'm starting to go through the chat right now."
"2456840","2458320"," Some which did every day."
"2458380","2461580"," I have some weird shit going down in my a whole past week. "
"2461600","2464600"," I've had weird shit going down in my, uh, my brokerage."
"2464960","2466520"," I think it's because I'm not logging out."
"2497190","2507100"," Do that beautiful bear cross back here in the 15"
"2507100","2507440"," minute. "
"2507560","2512060"," We saw this yesterday before the close 15 minute bear plane above here."
"2513160","2514140"," One hour."
"2514920","2516780"," Big key right here, right?"
"2517380","2519420"," Look at that big bear plane above. "
"2520420","2522380"," Gorgeous bear plane right here."
"2523240","2524920"," On the hourly now."
"2525900","2527120"," To the downside. "
"2531200","2536700"," It's actually formed it like what this was actually formed to like 1 a.m. And I was like, oh,"
"2536800","2538040"," it's right there sitting there."
"2538200","2540140"," I don't know if you guys are watching futures last time."
"2544740","2549540"," So the one hour trend change usually lasts a few days. "
"2549940","2550900"," Not just one day."
"2551360","2553980"," One, two, three, four, five days somewhere in there in the early."
"2555200","2557640"," We have another one that has not confirmed yet. "
"2557800","2559440"," This is the four hour super trend."
"2560000","2564840"," We were still waiting for this white one to come down below down here and see if it'll confirm even"
"2564840","2565160"," more."
"2565580","2569220"," So on the one hour trend, it's usually three to five days of down. "
"2569220","2571140"," Four hour trend can be weeks."
"2571960","2575920"," And then, of course, we have no confirmation at all yet on the major crash."
"2577020","2580200"," The major at the major doom crash that everybody likes to talk about. "
"2581840","2585300"," And we still have not broken trend down here at three ninety two."
"2585640","2586760"," So no trend down."
"2586920","2590500"," No trend breakdown here yet, like those three ninety five three ninety six. "
"2591400","2592200"," None of that."
"2592280","2596520"," We also have the quarterly low that has not been put into the market yet."
"2596520","2602080"," So that would be the end of June looking for solid may go away into the end of June. "
"2602160","2607500"," Still don't have that quarterly low yet as we head into June."
"2608020","2608880"," Back here."
"2614610","2616130"," Where's that one hour?"
"2617590","2619490"," One hours on hourly trigger. "
"2621430","2626430"," Thirty minutes on four four thirteen ninety three."
"2627710","2630210"," Fifteen minutes on four thirteen flat."
"2631010","2634870"," And this daily trigger is going to be a major major point right there. "
"2641860","2644580"," If you are a dip bar, you know how to buy dips around here."
"2644680","2645560"," You're looking for a cross."
"2648000","2649520"," No cross for the bulls. "
"2650280","2651460"," Still trading to the downside."
"2652480","2654260"," Still trading below the twenty seven EMA."
"2655000","2656320"," Still trading below the six EMA. "
"2656560","2660380"," You want you know exactly what you're looking for looking for price to go higher."
"2660380","2662340"," Trade above and confirm."
"2663040","2668380"," And then you can take a trade right here if you like but otherwise still still bearishness in the"
"2668380","2668720"," market. "
"2668720","2670320"," No change right now."
"2671420","2673680"," No change for the bulls."
"2677020","2679040"," Still no dip divide for the bulls. "
"2684270","2689130"," Yeah, still no but still no still no dip divide for the bulls bull still have shit for them going"
"2689130","2690210"," for themselves right now."
"2690210","2691210"," Nothing."
"2691550","2694230"," The bulls need to see a cross and they're not seeing it. "
"2695210","2698930"," Until bulls see a cross the downside continues."
"2699850","2701550"," So you see a cross like that."
"2702890","2704110"," Cross like this. "
"2704930","2706290"," And you see price get above."
"2708490","2709590"," And confirm."
"2712090","2715070"," Only then could you take along as a bull. "
"2715870","2716950"," That confirmation here."
"2716950","2721350"," Outside of that still downside to the stank market."
"2735850","2738410"," All you bulls want to buy that though so bad don't you. "
"2739410","2740830"," The bulls are looking for a dip."
"2743510","2753750"," And bulls"
"2753750","2755150"," are like let's start buying dips."
"2756710","2758890"," I don't I'm not necessarily on that. "
"2758990","2761150"," I want to wait for I want to wait for the fed."
"2761970","2763530"," I wrote this down last night."
"2764090","2767370"," I should break it out so I can show it to you what I read in the fed last or"
"2767370","2768630"," I wrote down about the fed last night. "
"2769070","2771210"," There's a key point about the fed today."
"2772650","2774250"," And there's there's like this."
"2774450","2776010"," Let me get it out second read it to you. "
"2776070","2776690"," Hold on a second here."
"2780170","2782990"," I'm writing these daily briefs in the background every day."
"2782990","2784170"," I'm not releasing them to you. "
"2785350","2787530"," But we're going to start if we're going to monetize."
"2787950","2790810"," We're going to kind of have to monetize the discord."
"2793010","2794430"," To keep out the scammers. "
"2795130","2800430"," So we're going to do is you're going to get a written daily brief every day from me."
"2802290","2806430"," And in these I write these daily briefs now to see how they play out the following day."
"2807510","2808470"," And they've been pretty good. "
"2808630","2809230"," They're pretty consistent."
"2811350","2813170"," So let me read some of this to you."
"2829280","2832320"," But I do want to read this is an important thing for you this morning. "
"2833400","2836280"," So after reaching new highs on the S&P 500."
"2836900","2839900"," Remember this new highs on the S&P 500."
"2840940","2842500"," The best week. "
"2843520","2848140"," Or the best is like we just came off the best week of performance."
"2849180","2851120"," And the S&P 500 and the cues."
"2852480","2855520"," Right like a time to celebrate time to take profit. "
"2856360","2856860"," Right."
"2857200","2858900"," Sit back and look for a dip to buy."
"2860400","2862260"," Always like it's always fascinating. "
"2862260","2864680"," People are like bear doom."
"2864860","2865860"," And I'm like I like the bear doom."
"2866140","2867060"," I like the cooling off. "
"2867440","2870340"," But we remember we just hit 420."
"2872980","2875060"," You're going to expect some profit taking."
"2875320","2878580"," You're going to expect some major players to want some FOMO. "
"2879140","2879960"," And they want a good price."
"2880480","2882200"," We had puts clothes in the money yesterday."
"2882900","2885140"," We had people buying the market in yesterday's clothes. "
"2886040","2887660"," Well, that's a nice dip right there."
"2887780","2888360"," I like that dip."
"2888580","2888980"," Oof. "
"2889660","2891100"," That's looking juicy to me."
"2916870","2918270"," I'm not getting fills again."
"2920070","2921190"," Not getting fills. "
"2921530","2922050"," You fuck dude."
"2922170","2923170"," These fucking dealers man."
"2923270","2924230"," I'm getting some shitty. "
"2924990","2925910"," Shitty fills."
"2927750","2929130"," I'm getting some fucking."
"2929390","2932810"," This has been going on for me on like every dip by this whole week. "
"2933110","2936350"," Dept selling dip buying hasn't mattered."
"2936350","2938850"," These fucks are not filling me like I'm there."
"2938970","2941410"," They're like shaving me five pennies every single time. "
"2948470","2950370"," So after reaching new highs in the SP 500."
"2950870","2956470"," It's finally cooled off heading into Wednesday's FOMC minutes at 2 p.m. It is expected that the"
"2956470","2958490"," minutes I want you guys pay attention to this for today."
"2959370","2965030"," It is expected that the minutes will soften soften the feds hawkish tone for the summer months. "
"2965050","2966110"," It is expected."
"2966110","2968410"," We are so coming into this meeting."
"2968870","2971010"," It is expected that they're going to soften their tone. "
"2971790","2972710"," For the summer months."
"2973330","2980050"," Any deviation committing to raising rates in June from the minutes will not be well received."
"2984080","2984680"," Right. "
"2984820","2989220"," So any deviation from we are expecting talk of a pause in these minutes."
"2990460","2991060"," Right."
"2991220","2992280"," Any deviation from that. "
"2995620","2995900"," Right."
"2996360","3000860"," So there should be talk in this and this in these minutes there should be discussion of a pause."
"3001200","3003740"," Not necessarily we're getting a pause but just a discussion. "
"3006080","3011560"," If there is no discussion of that if it's just like straight talk like we're raising rates in June."
"3013040","3015860"," Full full max forward 50 bps."
"3017240","3020800"," That will not be received well in these in this in this in this minutes release. "
"3023660","3028940"," Now Jerome Powell did firmly state that they're not going to pause in the last rate decision."
"3029400","3030660"," But there were two key points."
"3031560","3035040"," Inside of that inside of that last rate decision. "
"3035900","3040020"," That the language changed from previous statements."
"3041060","3044920"," That they released like the ones that are like these are on paper."
"3045600","3049280"," These are like the you go by these they did change their language. "
"3050220","3052280"," When Jerome Powell was pressed."
"3052880","3055960"," So when he was being questioned in the in the Q&A from the reporters."
"3056760","3061700"," His first answer was this is not a pause his firm on that. "
"3062220","3064120"," But then as he was pressed in that interview."
"3065040","3070280"," As he was pressed in that interview he actually changed and softened his tone."
"3070800","3074620"," To reflect the news release the press release that he gave. "
"3074620","3080560"," And since then some of the tone from these little fed presidents has been softened."
"3081500","3086540"," So today inside today inside of this of this of this fed minutes."
"3087000","3092780"," You're expecting some softening in the discussion for at least the summer months. "
"3092940","3094060"," Now personally."
"3094880","3096600"," I think we get 25 bps."
"3097120","3099240"," I think we could have a possibility of a pause. "
"3099240","3105480"," It's greater than it's been in the past due to some real shit coming down the pike this summer."
"3106600","3110360"," I don't see the fed looking at the summer and saying we're out of the woods yet."
"3110660","3114360"," We know that commercial real estate is like on the horizon. "
"3114740","3119900"," We know that the fed has chosen to support along the way."
"3120540","3124780"," They kind of like flip their cards to us and said yeah we're tightening."
"3125380","3127900"," But as soon as we break something we're going to support it. "
"3128360","3131000"," So if they're looking at this summer they're not going to tell you this."
"3131180","3133500"," They're not going to say yeah we've got this fear of this happening."
"3134000","3135040"," Fear of that happening. "
"3135500","3136440"," Fear of this happening."
"3136640","3137460"," They're not going to tell you that."
"3137540","3138940"," They don't want to create fear in the market. "
"3139560","3143340"," But if they're if they're seeing this down the road having to support this stuff."
"3143800","3148120"," There could be some softening in the feds monetary policy."
"3148480","3151380"," So you'll be looking for that today in the fed minutes. "
"3151900","3155100"," Is that does that discussion take place if it doesn't take place."
"3155480","3156220"," It's no bueno."
"3156220","3159000"," But I want you to know that the reaction to that is going to be bad. "
"3159740","3160260"," Right."
"3160560","3166340"," So so today into this these fed me fed fed meetings release at 2 p.m. You need to be"
"3166340","3167460"," paying attention to that."
"3167740","3168460"," Hold on a second. "
"3168560","3169240"," I'm trying to look at my."
"3171800","3174080"," So it's soft is his a."
"3174880","3180120"," So he's not pausing in the last rate decision that he did soften during questioning from reporters"
"3180120","3185100"," and the official rate decision press release removed previous harsher wording."
"3185800","3192440"," I am expecting 25 bps those are small possible small possible of no rays in the in the summer. "
"3192980","3199760"," Due to the debt limit ceiling garbage that we keep seeing in the news or some unforeseen vault for"
"3199760","3200900"," events like a credit crunch."
"3201400","3205700"," Commercial real estate failures this summer that kind of stuff any of that stuff that wears its"
"3205700","3206300"," ugly head."
"3207020","3209300"," That would force the fed to take a wait and see approach. "
"3210020","3212200"," I do also have some angst."
"3212540","3217080"," I want to give you this last part to this to this part for today for the fed minutes."
"3218020","3219960"," I actually do have some angst. "
"3220580","3224620"," If there's any of the reasons given to why there might be a pause."
"3225300","3227480"," Those could be perceived negatively."
"3228160","3231140"," And that's a key point here that I haven't seen discussed. "
"3231800","3237740"," I haven't seen it in any of the news."
"3237740","3238700"," I haven't seen it discussed."
"3239200","3244100"," Maybe it's out there, but I haven't seen it like in mass out there on fence to it. "
"3244300","3249900"," So my fear is if they were to even say, yeah, we're discussing a pause this summer."
"3250020","3253180"," If they give the reasons for that pause, that could create fear."
"3253860","3256700"," I feel like, yeah, we think we did this or we see. "
"3257280","3258320"," I feel like specific."
"3259000","3263420"," We see commercial real estate crisis happening in July or some shit like that are in June."
"3264360","3266020"," That could create more panic in the marketplace. "
"3266020","3272940"," So I want to be hyper aware of that into these into into today's minutes release in the content"
"3272940","3274860"," content of it."
"3274900","3275320"," Excuse me."
"3284940","3286900"," Yeah, I'm on that VIX weekly too. "
"3287600","3289760"," I'm watching that VIX weekly trigger in the background, brother."
"3298870","3300150"," Hang tight for a second, guys."
"3300630","3301510"," Getting text messages. "
"3332160","3333520"," Come on, baby."
"3333520","3343440"," VIX now trade in 2060, looking for a VIX to get to 22.84. Got a bunch"
"3343440","3344300"," of gaps down below."
"3344500","3358910"," They need to be closed down here at 409.47, 409.07, 408.88. There's"
"3358910","3359770"," a light guide by it. "
"3360290","3364330"," Yeah, I'm sitting on 410, 410 P's."
"3365930","3378340"," So we'll see if we can get down there and close 408.88. VIX"
"3378340","3379340"," is higher, a lot of pricing."
"3379760","3381700"," VIX is higher, a lot of pricing and options happen. "
"3382320","3383320"," Price can vary really well."
"3383620","3385600"," Yeah, I'm not getting the fills that I want right now."
"3386940","3389720"," They're like, they're like, I'm trying to like nailing on. "
"3389920","3391920"," I'm trying to get fills and I'm not getting them."
"3406550","3409950"," It's been happening to me like it happened to me on Thursday."
"3410450","3411450"," We were going up to that 420. "
"3411870","3414770"," I was getting fills that day and we're going down."
"3414910","3416370"," I'm not getting fills in the way down either."
"3417550","3420030"," And then I'm going above the ask too, by the way. "
"3420370","3423010"," I'm going like a penny or two above the ask and they're just not filling them."
"3441560","3443800"," Margaret is saying I think Fed minutes are going to be fine."
"3444080","3446580"," No hawkish tone as the meeting happened during some bank crisis. "
"3446580","3448960"," Fed was extra cautious about spreading more fear than."
"3451700","3459640"," Yeah, I don't, I don't, I'm not as fearful about, I'm not as fearful about, I'm not as fearful"
"3459640","3460400"," about what."
"3462680","3465820"," I'm like more on the side of discussion about a pause. "
"3467220","3471780"," But I don't want to see them talk about specific things and I want them to say like, yeah, in"
"3471780","3475280"," fucking June, we're going to get a meltdown in commercial real estate."
"3475880","3479340"," Like any of that kind of speculation could be perceived negatively."
"3480220","3481200"," That's my one fear. "
"3481340","3484480"," I don't want those minutes to come out and have them discussing specific."
"3487180","3488520"," Like specific instances."
"3489460","3497340"," Let me see if I see you on speaking now. "
"3497720","3502720"," Yeah, she's saying I'm seeing stress in the financial markets, including bill auctions."

"3919900","3921180"," Like you would get the."
"3924240","3925720"," This is exactly what this is. "
"3925840","3927460"," I'm going to show you when we get the credit downgrade."
"3928180","3929700"," Let's say exactly where price will be."
"3947260","3950280"," Someone just asked like when do we expect a credit downgrade?"
"3951380","3956140"," You'd expect price to fail somewhere in here and then right at this four oh five, you would get"
"3956140","3956720"," your downgrade. "
"3957460","3959180"," Like that's where you would get your downgrade."
"3959480","3961360"," Like if you saw news drop like price matters."
"3961820","3964960"," We're like four oh four four oh five like a blasted through down here. "

"3978720","3982700"," That's the one where you get the we go straight to the depths of health."
"3982700","3984640"," So so it wouldn't even be until."
"3985480","3990580"," I'm going to I would make a I would make a educated guess here right around rejection at four oh"
"3990580","3991960"," four oh five somewhere in there. "
"3993740","3994480"," Somewhere in there."
"3994520","3998360"," So do you get to expect like a downgrade right here more than likely not."
"3998620","4000900"," According to the lowest in September of 1983. "
"4002320","4006220"," It would likely be would likely be like a rejection of four oh five something like that."
"4008000","4010120"," And that's when you get your fucking bear suit on."
"4010380","4015580"," Like that's when you're like fucking full port mortgage the house sell the kids loan the wife out. "

"4033860","4037520"," Winky was like if we go down there and do that shit he's like I'm out."
"4038220","4041620"," He's like I'll come back in six months or a year and I'm like yeah that makes sense."
"4041640","4043040"," I'm like it doesn't make that doesn't. "
"4043160","4047900"," I don't I don't see that as like a bad thing to do."
"4048940","4053940"," So if you got a rejection on four oh four four oh five and they like come out with three"
"4053940","4059600"," credit downgrades and you're a bull fucking take the money and just bounce at four oh five."
"4060580","4061840"," Come back in six months. "
"4062340","4065460"," If you don't want to deal with a bear market I'll still be here with you."

"4104090","4104470"," Let me look."
"4105350","4106029"," Let's take a look."
"4106109","4107330"," Let's take a look at it together as a group. "

"4164920","4166580"," Looking for debt crisis stuff. "
"4168279","4171000"," So you see the blast below right."
"4171720","4176660"," So you have trend being broken right major trend being broken."
"4176660","4180359"," And you see the attempt. "
"4181640","4184160"," Just get in stay higher right."

"4197480","4198480"," Hooper breath of air."
"4200260","4204120"," Just another reason to grab some liquidity for the downside right. "
"4204120","4207000"," And you see that failure right there to get a new high."
"4207700","4209240"," And then we break below."
"4210660","4211140"," Trend. "
"4213120","4217840"," All in here is where like you're a bear and you're just waiting for that break of trend."
"4218920","4221860"," And that's where we have that blast straight down to the depths of hell."

"4315220","4316200"," To the downside. "
"4318380","4319760"," Are we there yet right now."
"4321080","4322280"," I already know that we're not."
"4328050","4329330"," Look at it right now. "

"4370660","4373560"," And that's where we get that that nasty move to the downside."
"4373840","4375560"," That's where you get super bearish right in there."
"4375560","4377200"," Or a forish. "

"4484200","4486460"," We have I think it's called a Twitter pulse."
"4487060","4488460"," I probably shouldn't have told you that."
"4489360","4492620"," So working on a tool called Twitter policy it's very similar to. "
"4494360","4496380"," The tool that the fed is using."
"4496720","4498340"," So when that was released yesterday."
"4499160","4501600"," I tried to read through it and then read all of the reference. "

"4546020","4546400"," 500. "
"4548360","4552040"," Your your posts on Twitter removed from the results."

"4564300","4566280"," All the emojis I think they included that too. "
"4568740","4574220"," In the association with words like bad by itself what as long as it was just bad but not like"
"4574220","4575360"," bad ass or something."
"4575900","4577780"," They knew they knew that that was good."
"4579620","4583180"," And they were associated like bad with bad news that kind of stuff. "
"4583960","4587700"," They were like a sign negativity to it."
"4587700","4590940"," The whole press conference at 1145 a.m. Eastern time."
"4591200","4593620"," So that's just under one hours time now again. "
"4593820","4595320"," McCarthy due to hold a press conference."
"4596480","4599180"," Another fascinating part of that way paper."
"4599360","4602540"," They said that Twitter is generally negative. "
"4602800","4610340"," Get free daily points for Benachi and market profile levels by signing up at to the tick dot com."
"4610580","4616140"," They said that they said Twitter was generally negative and was was never positive."
"4616140","4621560"," So they said that the gist of it was what I took away from it was. "
"4623060","4630560"," If you get a positive fed right if so if the fed comes out with a rate shock."
"4631380","4632740"," That's positive."
"4634540","4637840"," Twitter gets negative because of the positivity. "
"4638840","4644440"," If the rate shock is negative like or something like if they pause rates."
"4646280","4648560"," There's an increase in negativity."
"4650040","4652820"," To like a it's like a it's like a dovish fed. "
"4654860","4658120"," There's no like positivity on Fintuit."
"4658340","4661280"," Fintuit's like like baseline is negative."
"4662300","4664260"," That's just fucking baseline. "
"4665800","4667800"," Like there's no like they can't met."
"4667960","4671240"," They were like we can't measure this from like positive and negative sentiments."
"4671800","4673380"," Like it's just baseline negative. "
"4674280","4676020"," If we if we like pause."
"4676680","4677400"," Fintuit's negative."
"4678900","4680960"," So basically if they're like can we get a pause?"
"4681740","4683040"," You'll see Fintuit come out and be like. "
"4685020","4686160"," That's not good man."
"4687160","4690660"," The fed pause and rates is going to lead to really bad inflation."
"4691880","4693160"," The feds out of control. "
"4693420","4694340"," They're not doing the job."
"4694740","4696720"," They're going to crash the economy pause and rates."
"4698760","4699260"," Right. "
"4699460","4703260"," So that's like the that's like the thesis that there's oh that the thesis but that's not even a"
"4703260","4703520"," thesis."
"4703540","4704360"," That's their results."
"4705800","4710820"," And then they're saying let's say they slam us with 50 bps instead of a pause. "
"4712320","4714200"," Fintuit gets even more negative."
"4715620","4719060"," So Fintuit gets like oh 50 bps."
"4719060","4720880"," Stock market crash dude. "
"4721060","4721520"," Next week."
"4721920","4722300"," It's done."
"4725320","4727500"," So that was fascinating in their results. "
"4744690","4745210"," Thanks."
"4745290","4746250"," I got to answer this text."
"4834140","4839920"," So more from these citizens CEO they say the bank is making sure that it has liquidity as is"
"4839920","4841020"," referring to a prior headline. "
"4841280","4845300"," They say they are to cut around 500 SPB employees according to Axios."
"4913810","4920430"," Yeah, it was wild to read the sorry I had to respond I had to respond to to a winky"
"4920430","4920990"," really quick."
"4922210","4922990"," One second here. "
"4943490","4948810"," Yeah, the white paper was fascinating to read or the feds white paper was fast fascinating read."
"4960480","4962460"," You didn't need a scientist to tell you that."
"4964680","4973050"," I just thought it was fascinating I was like I was like the base cases that Fintuit is negative and"
"4973050","4975930"," I'm like I'm like we have scientific proof now. "
"4977690","4978950"," Scientific fucking proof."
"4980330","4981750"," From the fed zone mouth."
"4989960","4996060"," Yeah, I was I was interested in that to FX retracer it seemed like the consumer confidence kind of"
"4996060","4998680"," tracks closely to Twitter sentiment didn't it. "
"4999040","4999740"," It wasn't to."
"5000160","5003100"," There were some divergences here and there but not too many."
"5003840","5007320"," When I haven't looked more closely at that the other thing that pissed me off about that white"
"5007320","5010780"," paper was that their graph sucked. "
"5011740","5014980"," It was like 2019 and then they had higher and lower."
"5017200","5019420"," They had higher and lower ticks on it."
"5020380","5023860"," So you're like is that is that middle of the year is that. "
"5024840","5029580"," Is like is like where they write 2018 2019 2020 is that January."
"5030280","5035440"," Or is that like June July in the ticks represents first of the year."
"5040640","5042220"," So I was wondering about that as well. "
"5043380","5046760"," Then how do I transfer that I'm gonna have to do like a cut and paste job and."
"5047740","5050540"," Overlay it on the same size graph on SPX."
"5050540","5053560"," So I got to figure all that out of my own. "
"5078700","5080240"," Yeah, I think he was talking about."
"5080600","5085520"," I think he was talking about."
"5088100","5092560"," I think it was Costco or Walmart or one of those companies and he was saying. "
"5094460","5098960"," That they always dump into their earnings and then the moment they have like we have Costco"
"5098960","5100040"," earnings coming up this week."
"5100860","5102600"," Then they just buy the fuck out of it."
"5102680","5106260"," They've got stellar earnings and updates on the debt negotiations. "
"5106540","5112420"," So again, McCarthy did announce his to have a presser today just under an hour's time at 11 45 a "
"5112420","5113180",".m. Eastern time."
"5119120","5122900"," Market still sitting on waiting the Fed news today."
"5123320","5128400"," It's 11 o'clock at 2 p.m. So you've got three more hours of this bullshit of the market"
"5128400","5130740"," just holding here for the presser. "
"5131920","5133140"," We have three."
"5134520","5136840"," Three previous lows to fill down below."
"5137400","5140160"," If we're already down here might as well fill these at some point. "
"5140260","5144600"," We've got four nine forty seven four nine oh seven four oh eight eighty eight."
"5145260","5148840"," We have asked three down below at four oh seven twenty four."
"5149280","5153180"," And then we have the weekly trigger down here at four oh four forty two. "
"5277000","5279040"," We just want to say I got some stuff I got to do in the background."
"5307050","5308470"," Did I already get to go potty man."
"5312670","5317270"," Like I pound so much water in the morning and coffee like like for some reason like I drink a"
"5317270","5318150"," hot coffee in the morning. "
"5318910","5320090"," And then I switch to."
"5323170","5326190"," I switch to ice coffee and water."
"5326870","5330950"," When we get in the morning pound water then I pound or then I drink a hot cup of coffee. "
"5331590","5334450"," But then I switch to like ice cold water with ice in it."
"5334550","5335150"," Nice cold coffee."
"5335810","5336950"," I'm just like chugging it. "
"5337150","5438770"," So I got this"
"5438770","5442550"," liquidity down here where we at four ten right down here."
"5442650","5444230"," Nice bar of liquidity down here."
"5451520","5453320"," Just a second here I got more stuff going on. "
"5458580","5460660"," You guys want to look at Tesla real quick we can look at Tesla."
"5460660","5463320"," Tesla yesterday."
"5491900","5497100"," Came up broke through we were we watched this trade yesterday Tesla came up. "
"5498000","5502340"," Blasted above just like the whale we talk about right the whale comes up on the plane."
"5503060","5507400"," Breaks through the clouds breaches through the clouds who makes that noise."
"5508260","5511320"," Comes back down how did the confirmation. "
"5513620","5519860"," Slam down on the weekly trigger blasted higher again got a new high at one ninety four rolled over"
"5519860","5522740"," confirmed the trade was dead."
"5525200","5526880"," On one eighty six."
"5527640","5532300"," The moment we trade underneath it we started to trade down to one seventy nine price target down"
"5532300","5533120"," below on Tesla. "
"5533920","5539780"," Trade is dead but not completely dead we have daily still rising up."
"5539780","5545880"," We're going to be looking for a bounce on one seventy four sixty one and then consolidation."
"5546920","5551700"," We'll see if Tesla can consolidate here and turn itself around to go higher. "
"5552300","5555660"," So we'll find out here I still think trade is higher and Tesla will be honest with you."
"5556080","5559860"," But whenever we come into these whenever we come into these resistance levels here."
"5560260","5563400"," We always expect volatility like we said right here. "
"5563860","5565980"," And we saw volatility here in the weekly."
"5566820","5574160"," So you're going to be looking for entry again if you're a bull on Tesla at one seventy five or"
"5574160","5574680"," a second here."
"5582500","5586660"," You're going to your next entry for Tesla is going to be this one seventy five you're going to wait"
"5586660","5590520"," for the hourly to show you the way higher for a breakthrough above. "
"5593640","5601560"," Your stops will be a below one seventy three oh three for the next leg of this trade on Tesla."
"5603100","5610040"," So there's your Tesla trade daily velocity just now starting to get bullish believe it or not."
"5610640","5615580"," You'll also be looking for the hourly for entry down here we're getting very close to that hourly"
"5615580","5617820"," entry and velocity on Tesla. "
"5617820","5626540"," So get ready for Tesla at one seventy four sixty six would not surprise me watch this watch this"
"5626540","5630980"," hourly trend right here would not surprise me to see this hourly here."
"5631400","5638480"," Come down and need to give the leg in support and you're probably at this point going to also need"
"5638480","5645100"," daily velocity to come up and help with price to break above weekly."
"5645840","5650740"," So somewhere in here you're looking for that trade higher and to take it you can also wait on this"
"5650740","5653620"," trade if you want to if you want to trade this in safety. "
"5657610","5661950"," If you want to wait and trade this in safety you're going to be looking for."
"5663630","5664730"," So we got weekly here."
"5671770","5677850"," Summer around one eighty one eighty two and if price does get above here check back with me and"
"5677850","5679850"," we'll see if that next leg comes higher. "
"5679970","5683630"," I'm going to give it one two three weeks max in here."
"5685310","5688450"," One to three weeks somewhere in there Monday to the next three weeks."
"5689530","5694530"," Let's start looking for a bounce trade down here on the daily trigger it is to the upside it's not"
"5694530","5695310"," to the downside. "
"5696430","5701630"," This is the critical one right here excuse me if this was coming down."
"5703430","5709930"," It'd be extremely bull or bearish here but I am still bullish on Tesla nothing has changed as of"
"5709930","5710950"," yet on Tesla to the upside."
"5711690","5718210"," Nothing has been broken this is perfectly normal and fine price target above remains two seventeen"
"5718210","5719190"," thirty six. "
"5733990","5741010"," That one eighty six man that one eighty six man we're talking about that price for like days right."
"5742550","5747310"," Abandon ship on one eighty six man who that was a nasty trade below that."
"5751720","5753360"," Nasty trade that went down. "
"5761740","5763820"," Four point two five percent."
"5766800","5776800"," Yeah the EMA lines are"
"5776800","5780840"," like it's weird like people ask me sometimes they're like here we'll bring Tesla back up."
"5783500","5786940"," You'll hear it from like bears and like bears and bulls both say it. "
"5788040","5788900"," Bring it back up."
"5789500","5792460"," It's like bears and bulls will say the same thing to you whether you're going up or down."
"5794120","5801490"," So if you're if you're like bullish on a stock right you come up here to this this daily you're"
"5801490","5802370"," going to reject right. "
"5803330","5808530"," It's going to take time for velocity to catch up to push you to the next level if this chart"
"5808530","5809490"," was upside down."
"5809930","5815030"," You'd have the same thing right if we're trading lower you need to get underneath reject same same"
"5815030","5816110"," kind of a deal right."
"5816390","5821210"," And then and then you make your next leg down so each step going down each step going up same"
"5821210","5821490"," thing. "
"5821490","5827050"," So you bear a bull will say why is it not going up anymore like they expect like straight up"
"5827050","5829610"," and bears expect you know straight down."
"5829750","5831030"," This doesn't happen."
"5833450","5836950"," So you always get asked from people or you're always getting asked like. "
"5838230","5843150"," This trade debt is we still going down or we still going up that kind of stuff."
"5843890","5846190"," Or they or they enter at the wrong time."
"5850130","5854330"," You know if they can bear you like buying the bottom to go down more instead of the top where"
"5854330","5856350"," the role is that kind of stuff. "
"5857370","5860350"," You get most of your questions at those levels."
"5869490","5872010"," You guys are saying I'm twitch I missed a bunch of shit and twitch."
"5874230","5876950"," These change daily yeah they change every day. "
"5889240","5891180"," Yeah they didn't they didn't call puts at 190."
"5895440","5900200"," I don't think that they did I thought that they called puts I think they called puts yesterday at"
"5900200","5903740"," one eighty nine and then it bounced and ripped to one ninety four."
"5904640","5909140"," That's not what happened I remember yesterday you guys called puts at one eighty nine and I said I"
"5909140","5910880"," wouldn't take that trade until it's confirmed. "
"5911780","5916920"," And we got a giant green wick and we blasted higher and just blew out all those puts all those"
"5916920","5923300"," puts got blown out."
"5924620","5927660"," I got to get you guys this fucking white paper so you can read it."
"5932990","5938250"," So the trade so the trade here was actually below one eighty six on the failure on the on the"
"5938250","5939010"," second bounce. "
"5941170","5945830"," If you look at the trade if you were like when we went over when when when Tessa went over"
"5945830","5948670"," yesterday right it went over bounced and then went higher."
"5949990","5952690"," Right so it came back down the first test on that one eighty six."
"5953470","5957730"," If you like so I was asked yesterday it was like we're like one eighty nine or something and"
"5957730","5958190"," someone said. "
"5958630","5962890"," I take the puts there and I was like fuck no you want to have that confirmation below it one"
"5962890","5963390"," eighty six."
"5963970","5968010"," And we bounced so I'm one eighty six or no one eighty nine."
"5968470","5974390"," We went down to the to the weekly and then we got a giant green wick to the upside. "
"5974570","5977730"," So if you're like a trader and you bounce there."
"5978330","5983110"," So you bought the one ninety P's and you came back down to the weekly."
"5983790","5988910"," There was a giant green wick that came up and that would have blown you out of your position to"
"5988910","5989150"," get it. "
"5989250","5994350"," You know how you get into like a position and you're like I'm directionally right and then you get"
"5994350","5995070"," squeezed out."
"5995070","5999430"," Let's see by like I don't know fucking Tesla puts for four bucks and they go to like a dollar"
"5999430","6001030"," and you freak out and you're like I'm out of here."
"6001570","6002870"," And then it goes your way eventually. "
"6004550","6010910"," You want those trades to be like like like like making bank and you're confirming that you're going"
"6010910","6011250"," down."
"6012050","6016690"," You do those like nine ten times that's when you get your your your greatest win ratio."
"6027580","6029220"," Does it make it does it make any sense to you. "
"6029980","6033400"," I don't know if that makes sense to you guys you guys are going to get a white paper on"
"6033400","6035860"," this stuff so you can like look at it and be like yeah I get it now."
"6036640","6040580"," So you get like nine ten trades in a row that are always winners every time."
"6047520","6050360"," So here I'll show it to you in a better way. "
"6052160","6054680"," You always go back in this twenty twenty vision."
"6056160","6057400"," Let me show it to you right now."
"6058920","6061060"," There's go back in twenty twenty vision you're like. "
"6062600","6067380"," You're like so yesterday there was a call out right it was like actually I buy puts here at I"
"6067380","6069580"," believe this was at one eighty nine right here."
"6070860","6072080"," Should I buy puts here."
"6073400","6077940"," And my point yesterday at that time you can go back in yesterday's stream right at this time. "
"6078860","6079760"," I had said to you."
"6080360","6085720"," No I wouldn't take puts here just yet we're waiting to see if there's a confirmation bounce right."
"6086580","6092300"," And my point yesterday was if we go down here you could take that trade like if you're a fast"
"6092300","6093660"," trader you can take that trade. "
"6094340","6095760"," But most people can't take that trade."
"6096460","6099540"," The key point here is that there was this giant monster green bar."
"6100560","6104980"," So just not having any of this information here right if you're in puts here. "
"6105600","6109940"," You're like yeah I'm making fucking money I'm fucking making money and then you get squeezed out of"
"6109940","6111280"," your position does that make sense."
"6111860","6114100"," I know that happens to traders all the time."
"6114340","6115660"," No it happens all the time to people. "
"6116820","6121780"," So you're like well I got squeezed out a pair I'm nom down three bucks in a four dollar put"
"6121780","6122260"," let's say."
"6122840","6123680"," That's an example."
"6125320","6128600"," And then it rolls back down you're like shit I missed the trade right. "
"6128600","6130200"," That's a common thing for traders."
"6131840","6136060"," So if you're a bull here or if you're a bear and a bull there's a few trades in here"
"6136060","6137840"," just like looking back at dissect it."
"6138100","6141380"," There was a put trade here if you closed immediately. "
"6143220","6145540"," In your hindsight vision I bet you wouldn't have."
"6145860","6148920"," Matter of fact when we got that green bar yesterday it was a big green wick."
"6150640","6153880"," And I was like I bet you a bunch of these fucking bears got caught in that. "
"6155020","6160360"," So if you're a bull yesterday and you caught this down here which is what you're looking for"
"6160360","6162360"," confirmation right you took this higher."
"6163260","6165280"," And it winds up rolling on you."
"6165860","6170860"," Your first key is that you broke through the one in five minute you can see it right here see"
"6170860","6171740"," this one in five minute. "
"6173760","6178740"," You would have taken this trade up and you would automatically take profit the moment you crossed"
"6178740","6180680"," the twenty seven EMA."
"6180680","6181820"," You already know that right."
"6182120","6184740"," The moment you get underneath that twenty seven EMA the trade is over. "
"6185140","6189020"," This is the same on the bottom I was just saying about spy like you see price get above and"
"6189020","6189940"," you cross and across."
"6190600","6192220"," You exit that trade right."
"6192440","6194040"," And we just posted the BGL for you. "
"6194300","6196180"," Now let's say you didn't do this right."
"6196620","6200160"," So you didn't do this you're like oh shit I'm a bull you got caught to just like that bear"
"6200160","6200380"," did."
"6202140","6205020"," Right so you caught the book the bear here you caught the bull here. "
"6205560","6209120"," You come back down right the bull entered here."
"6209120","6215420"," On this green right here right right here that bull should have exited like immediately I'm out of"
"6215420","6215800"," that trade."
"6216440","6217180"," One eighty six. "
"6217860","6223060"," And a bear already knows that price is below the one in the five right twenty seven and the one"
"6223060","6223480"," twenty nine."
"6223900","6228220"," And the bear has a confirmation bar for a four trigger down cluster."
"6229180","6229940"," That's bearish. "
"6230340","6236120"," This is the this is the trade where the bear knows he's going to get some fucking blood right it's"
"6236120","6236920"," going to get a fucking print."
"6236920","6239220"," You're going to get a hundred percent print on that trade."
"6241880","6247080"," So if you run this trade again and again and again and again like ten twelve thirty forty hundred"
"6247080","6247480"," times. "
"6248480","6252060"," You're looking for these signs that you can enter with some conviction."
"6253480","6254500"," And where to exit."
"6256420","6260960"," You can actually see right now right just on just on tessell right here right. "
"6261880","6265020"," In the reverse for a bear we're going back to check."
"6266580","6268740"," One more time if we're still bearish."
"6269420","6270800"," If we get a cross here. "
"6280440","6284260"," If we get a cross here and price confirms the move is done."
"6285600","6288800"," You get one more green bar here."
"6289860","6291220"," And then it comes back down. "
"6291340","6291720"," Oh sorry."
"6292240","6295220"," It was back down and slams down here and starts to make the move higher."
"6295840","6298740"," A bull can't enter this until the confirmation trade here. "
"6298740","6302860"," And a bear needs to see that we're going to hold."
"6303840","6306340"," Sorry my my my thing's not working."
"6306640","6309420"," Like one eighty fifty one eighty one somewhere in there. "
"6311100","6316700"," And even if a bull took that trade they're then looking for only one ninety three one eighty three"
"6316700","6317120"," and change."
"6335280","6342740"," Big cute boy nine twelve said I just put fifty percent of my account twenty K and five twenty four"
"6342740","6344380"," expiry spy call."
"6344820","6347040"," The fed is pumping today let's go bulls. "
"6350910","6353970"," Curious on my take on TGT."
"6354970","6356310"," Take a look at TGT."
"6358310","6365410"," I like the stock. "
"6366070","6368570"," I like it a lot."
"6371730","6373410"," Let's look at a couple of different time frames."
"6373650","6374850"," I like TGT a lot right here. "
"6375570","6377290"," It's a great great ticker right now."
"6378830","6381210"," Starting to show some signs of coming back."
"6381630","6385630"," I like it a lot right now. "
"6385710","6386630"," It's a good good shadow."
"6386830","6387210"," Who called that?"
"6387470","6387750"," Spooner."
"6388450","6389590"," Dirty dog Spooner. "
"6389590","6392110"," I like TGT right here."
"6395810","6397100"," It's like a TGT next."
"6398760","6402540"," Dude hopefully we get a nice little fucking capitulation down here. "
"6403770","6406740"," Nice little just one last red bar to the depths of hell."
"6411200","6413500"," TGT great shout out."
"6414780","6416280"," Love it down here. "
"6417860","6420500"," Nice great capitulation bar down below."
"6420840","6422240"," This was on the twenty fourth."
"6422840","6426620"," Today at ten a.m. Two nice green bars price. "
"6427440","6431840"," It's just starting to train above the twenty seven and one twenty nine EMA."
"6432940","6434440"," Whatever you've got at home here."
"6434640","6437160"," We've got Max bearishness down below. "
"6437560","6438980"," This is what I always like to see."
"6439980","6445000"," Max bearishness on the hourly starting to come into some real bearishness down here."
"6445000","6452020"," On some real bearishness down here on the daily though it doesn't look quite done yet. "
"6452540","6459360"," On daily I always like to see not just Max bearishness but I like to see it start to step"
"6459360","6460100"," down."
"6460880","6463200"," Right for that trade higher right."
"6464320","6467580"," And we've got that nice beautiful Max bearishness down here. "
"6467900","6471980"," We could see some more consolidation down here."
"6471980","6477380"," Okay before you start to see your move higher though you can start to see that we're about to start"
"6477380","6478060"," cranking here."
"6479820","6482820"," So what can I extrapolate here on TGT?"
"6483520","6485020"," I love this shit too in here. "
"6485100","6486160"," This is all nice shit right here."
"6486240","6487580"," This is all root looking really good."
"6488380","6489980"," I really like this on TGT. "
"6490440","6491720"," See what happens down here."
"6495990","6496870"," Max bearishness."
"6498450","6500010"," I want you to see this right here. "
"6500150","6502650"," I always I said to you like this part of the trade down here."
"6502650","6504750"," That's where you get your real rip down there."
"6505290","6510150"," You can see as we start to get bearish in here there's still some consolidation going on. "
"6512010","6513350"," See it right here."
"6513730","6516030"," And you finally get your move to the upside on TGT."
"6517210","6518150"," So that's what can we gain. "
"6518530","6520570"," What can we glean from this over here?"
"6521450","6521910"," TGT."
"6524470","6526810"," We're going to look for a two previous lows."
"6531130","6532330"," One right there. "
"6533530","6534370"," That's small."
"6536680","6540060"," You got one more pivot point down below here."
"6542960","6545560"," You can see we're at some max bearishness. "
"6545660","6548820"," You can see that someone's looking to find a dip to buy down here."
"6604050","6605410"," That's nice right there."
"6612620","6615940"," 137-139 guaranteed by it. "
"6616200","6618620"," Not guaranteed, but stops below 137-139."
"6619300","6622320"," Trade is still alive between 137-139 to the upside."
"6623840","6625180"," Expect some kind of a failure here. "
"6625660","6627100"," We're not quite done with the downside."
"6627680","6637040"," So would not be shocked to see an attempt to go higher and possibly one more move down."
"6638520","6639980"," That's some consolidation here. "
"6639980","6642500"," And then that move higher in the daily."
"6643080","6644240"," It's going to be right here."
"6650560","6653400"," Price targets 160. "
"6654440","6657660"," And then possibly even a stretch to 175."
"6663720","6664980"," Yeah, it won't be 175."
"6665600","6668460"," It'll be 170 right here. "
"6669840","6671680"," Price target 2170."
"6676280","6677800"," Price target 1."
"6683010","6683810"," 160."
"6684790","6687750"," Nice buy on TGT if you've already bought this. "
"6688550","6689350"," That's pretty good."
"6691910","6693230"," Sell the world."
"6696370","6700390"," Below 139, 85, 137, 29. "
"6700790","6702090"," Any dip buy down here?"
"6703010","6703970"," Very productive."
"6705170","6705950"," Good call out."
"6707830","6708330"," TGT. "
"6709670","6710630"," That's Tarje."
"6713290","6714790"," Nice call out on that TGT."
"6731540","6733660"," More time we spend down below here. "
"6733760","6734760"," More bullish that we get."
"6734880","6736540"," We're not getting a series of new lows."
"6736860","6738060"," It's 11-20 in the afternoon. "
"6738680","6739240"," 11-05."
"6740660","6741520"," We got a new low."
"6743560","6745760"," 11-21 coming into the half an hour. "
"6746280","6747240"," Or the hour, excuse me."
"6747800","6749420"," Bears need a red bar here."
"6749420","6751200"," And the next 9 minutes. "
"6751500","6753680"," We need a new low below 410-45."
"6755240","6758420"," We'll start handing it over to the bulls here in just a few moments."
"6758680","6759320"," Next 10 minutes. "
"6760780","6765700"," We'll know if the bulls are back in charge for at least the next hour from 11-30 to 12 "
"6765700","6766560","-30."
"6769760","6771740"," Bears need new low next 9 minutes."
"6797700","6799240"," Yeah, there's no meeting today there. "
"6799320","6803600"," Well, it's not meant it's a release of their minutes from the rate decision."
"6808320","6809200"," 2PM for that."
"6816590","6821510"," But shoot, yeah, if we bought into the minutes, right, if we were like ripping face in the minutes,"
"6821530","6823190"," would you think that we're going to go up some more?"
"6823970","6824930"," Probably not, right?"
"6826590","6828390"," Probably think we're going to blast off, right?"
"6828390","6832990"," I think that's a good idea. "
"6836050","6840670"," If we were like trading 4.30, we rolled into the minutes and be like, sell the fuck out of"
"6840670","6842170"," this meeting or these minutes."
"6843670","6845210"," Like sell off into the minutes."
"6845690","6847350"," I'd be like, buy the shit out of that dip. "
"6849670","6851950"," Spy trading 4.11.01 right now."
"6852150","6852370"," Failing."
"6852830","6856470"," Bears failing to get the new low coming into the half hour so far. "

"7202630","7210130"," Can you imagine if you had a Fed Pause and you had debt ceiling negotiation success all at the same"
"7210130","7210730"," time today?"
"7213130","7216350"," I want to know in chat what do you guys think would happen?"
"7218310","7222370"," It would be the price target on both of those being solved at the same time today."
"7233580","7238520"," We'll be like rolling into rolling into this morning's broadcast and you got people going."
"7238840","7243460"," We're going to crash the fucking market and then they solve like both in an hour. "
"7247260","7252200"," That would be some funny shit."
"7254940","7257680"," You have like all these fucking bulls just like."
"7258320","7259400"," Abandon ship. "
"7260720","7263400"," You have every fucking bear like market crash."
"7266900","7270860"," Be back to 430 and all these bulls would be fucking high and dry."
"7271340","7273600"," All these fucking bears would be caught up in their pants. "
"7277140","7279000"," You'd see bulls re-enter at 430."
"7279120","7285900"," You'd see bears get fucking long at 430 or bears get long at 430 fucking bulls trying to get long"
"7285900","7286460"," at four through."
"7286560","7287320"," They dump it again. "
"7290220","7291700"," Sorry, I shouldn't say that shit."
"7297040","7298820"," Oh, man, that shit's so funny."
"7302580","7303680"," That made my day. "
"7304380","7306440"," Just because I can imagine that shit."
"7315760","7322700"," I was thinking about that Hagerny with Trump."
"7323120","7328960"," I was thinking about like when like Trump would be like China deal off China deal on to be down"
"7328960","7336420"," overnight like 10% fucking limits or us or limit down stops to the market and then we'd open up"
"7336420","7338940"," at 9.30 and wake up in the morning and be up all night long. "
"7339400","7344300"," I'd be in like a long position at like four o'clock and be like slamming the buy button on"
"7344300","7348820"," zero dates and then like four fucking 30."
"7349660","7353280"," We'd fucking go down like 10%, maybe not 10 like five."
"7355560","7362580"," That'd be worrying all night long and I missed the short in futures and then like 9.30. I'd be"
"7362580","7364100"," like pacing back and forth. "
"7364200","7366220"," It'd be like 9.15 or something nine o'clock."
"7367020","7368520"," China deal back on again."
"7368520","7370300"," We'd just rip faces off. "
"7375600","7377140"," Oh, man, dude."
"7377560","7378600"," That was some."
"7379300","7380160"," That was right. "
"7380300","7384220"," Dude, those were like sleepless night after sleepless night after sleepless night."
"7387020","7388260"," You'd have like bears."
"7388260","7390060"," This happened to both bears and bulls. "
"7390140","7391040"," Like it didn't matter."
"7391240","7393960"," Like if you were a bear and you're like buying puts at the bell."
"7395380","7401140"," The market would go up like fucking 10% and then at the open it'd be down 20%, not even"
"7401540","7402080"," exaggerating here. "
"7402160","7405820"," It'd be like up 5% but then down 10% your puts would actually print the next day."
"7406460","7407340"," It was fucking horrendous."
"7410380","7413580"," I feel like the dirtiest I've ever seen in the market like the dirtiest. "
"7413720","7415240"," I've only ever seen it at the time in history."
"7416020","7418180"," It was like the dirtiest, dirtiest market."
"7433440","7434980"," Yeah, I haven't sold Rocket Lab. "
"7435140","7437040"," I've got I've been accumulating bank."
"7437300","7439020"," I've been accumulating regional bank stocks."
"7439660","7446180"," I've got calls for IWM for a last expiry in June. "
"7446200","7447000"," Haven't sold them yet."
"7447580","7450740"," Been riding that zigzag channel all the way up."
"7450880","7455620"," So there's like a zigzag channel on IWM and riding that shit the whole way up. "
"7456220","7457240"," About the bottom of the channel."
"7457420","7458480"," We haven't broken that channel yet."
"7458620","7459340"," Still in that shit. "
"7459700","7460900"," Whole bunch of shit I'm still in."
"7463980","7465140"," I'm in no way."
"7465300","7465760"," Fairful here. "
"7466200","7467060"," I got zero."
"7467320","7467620"," I'm a bull."
"7467900","7469120"," I've got zero fair here. "
"7469340","7469420"," None."
"7470340","7471400"," For me to get fairful."
"7471580","7473300"," I need to see like that break below the weekly. "
"7473700","7475620"," I need to see the clothes underneath 404."
"7476340","7480660"," I need to see the failure to get above 404 and then I'll turn bear."
"7481560","7484400"," That's when I get like my bear like fucking bear suit on. "
"7485700","7487080"," But this is to me."
"7487200","7489840"," This is all just another chance to buy the dip."
"7490060","7491140"," I'll be honest with you. "
"7491860","7495720"," If you're asking, this is where you buy dips with stops underneath."
"7498380","7505200"," Like we're in the area like 404, 408, 412 like put on like a three month call and come back"
"7505200","7506520"," and check on it a month or two."
"7507660","7510200"," And it's like easy fucking money every time. "
"7510200","7515220"," And the more bearish you get, the more I'm convinced that we're going up."
"7517440","7518220"," I'll be honest."
"7518660","7519260"," Like that's the truth. "
"7520620","7527800"," Like I can't stand buying like 420 like can't like I'll do zero day lotos and shit but like putting"
"7527800","7528720"," size in the market."
"7528720","7529720"," We're right there dude."

"7939310","7941850"," On the downside the COVID crash. "
"7943310","7948150"," I'd like to two important lessons I learned in that crash or three let's say."
"7949910","7953770"," There were some major dips to buy in that crash they paid really well."
"7955530","7960870"," That was a firm lesson right that there were Bible dips in that crash believe it or not and then"
"7960870","7962930"," this and then the second lesson would be. "
"7964990","7970070"," When the reversal shows itself to actually close your fucking puts and take the fucking money and"

"7978370","7983230"," I fucked up in that crash to that last remember that last confirmation roll over. "
"7983810","7991110"," I bought the fucking Kool-Aid and that shit and I got bearish again on that so we had like"
"7991110","7994690"," a we had a capitulation movie came up and everything looked fine."
"7995150","7998950"," We had a made one more major roll over to confirm that the leg was higher."

"8019390","8021650"," hell like road that first fucking turnaround. "
"8021790","8024970"," I was on the I was on the bull Kool-Aid train for the upside."
"8025270","8027170"," We're never going to look back on this money printer."
"8027170","8032950"," We roll the fuck over one more last time and I was like oh shit bull bear like. "
"8034290","8039810"," That ain't saving shit and the bears are like we rolled over that last time."
"8039810","8044070"," If you remember I don't know if you remember now we like one more big roll over fucking bears are"
"8044070","8044270"," like."
"8044650","8047170"," I told you the fed wasn't going to save you. "
"8048970","8051670"," And I was like fuck yeah they're not going to save us I agree."
"8053430","8056330"," But of course when we bounced and went out who was a ton of money we made a ton of"
"8056330","8056750"," money so."
"8057230","8057690"," That's good. "

"8081410","8083590"," Two or three times on market crash."
"8084770","8086290"," Like this is it we're crashing."

"8091790","8092830"," That kind of shit."

"8109620","8110460"," drink that shit anymore."
"8113360","8117750"," But you guys want to hear McCarthy. "
"8118990","8123930"," Here's how speaking McCarthy says I told Biden I won't raise will you I won't raise taxes."
"8125150","8126790"," I'll put McCarthy on for you."
"8126850","8129990"," He says I've told Biden we won't raise taxes. "
"8135030","8137150"," Yeah the they're reading it off in the background."
"8157910","8160270"," The AP is not showing shit right now."
"8174580","8179180"," We're going to have a conversation harming every single family made us more dependent upon China. "
"8179760","8185440"," He has here that created three of the largest four bank failures in American history in the last"
"8185440","8185940"," couple months."
"8186160","8188380"," We cannot continue down this path."
"8188840","8192719"," But the president waited 97 days not even talk to me. "
"8192980","8197059"," He could have spoken to me said we were wrong on that other angles but he didn't."
"8197580","8199480"," And now we're eight days away."
"8200580","8201480"," From Biden having to fall. "
"8201600","8202139"," I don't want that to happen."
"8202340","8206100"," That's why the Republicans in the House in April lifted the debt ceiling with common sense sensible"
"8206100","8206340"," things."
"8206639","8208299"," They're pulling the COVID money back work requirements. "
"8208299","8209240"," They let people go back to work."
"8209459","8210580"," Help our supply chain because less dependent on China."
"8210820","8213360"," And more importantly people working in the social security and Medicare making those three entities"
"8213360","8213540"," stronger. "
"8214160","8215379"," And then making a stronger in our energy field."
"8215520","8217799"," We're cutting the red tape where we can build things in America again putting people back to work."
"8217940","8218160"," That's reasonable. "
"8218320","8219379"," That's rational but it sits in the Senate."
"8219780","8220459"," But the president waits too long."
"8220600","8221000"," You can always take that. "
"8225520","8227580"," Look there's differences we know where it's at."
"8227580","8230139"," You have to spend less than you spent last year."
"8230400","8232000"," That's not that difficult to do. "
"8232459","8235219"," But in Washington somehow that is a problem."
"8235639","8240559"," They have increased spending with the Democrats in the majority on discretionary spending by more"
"8240559","8241940"," than 33%."
"8241940","8244120"," No household's been able to afford to do that. "
"8244760","8245940"," We can find waste."
"8246219","8247160"," We can eliminate that."
"8247379","8250040"," The president eliminated a lot of places that we can't talk about. "
"8250379","8253879"," So I got a short area to do it but we found a reasonable way to do it."
"8253879","8255080"," So it's not that."
"8255299","8258420"," Look I think we can make progress today. "
"8258440","8261360"," U.S. House Speaker McCarthy says I think we can make progress today."
"8261500","8265120"," What do you say to those who believe you can't get to yes because so many members of your"
"8265120","8268219"," conference won't accept anything less than the bill you've already passed?"
"8268900","8269540"," They're wrong."
"8269840","8271580"," You know you underestimated me the whole time. "
"8272139","8276260"," The one thing you should learn from me I will never give up for the American people."
"8276860","8278879"," Those are the people I'm looking at."
"8278879","8282780"," So this is like the clown stuff now like where he has to like where he has to like talk"
"8282780","8283520"," to his people. "
"8284780","8289400"," So you just thank you because you just identified the problem."
"8289920","8293879"," You're speaking with officers we can get to a yes on the debt deal."
"8293959","8295260"," Nothing has happened in the Senate. "
"8295620","8296420"," I'm not a senator."
"8296700","8297959"," I don't control the Senate."
"8298280","8299580"," Why didn't they pass something?"
"8300020","8300900"," I got to tell my buddies. "
"8302260","8303780"," Dems do the same shit right?"
"8303780","8309639"," Don't blame me for reaching out to the Democrats for begging the president to meet with me or"
"8309639","8310440"," trying to find it."
"8310760","8315719"," And don't blame us Republicans when we put a reasonable bill together that we actually took"
"8315719","8316620"," Democrats ideas."
"8317059","8324299"," So when we put spending for government and increase it 1% each year to cap it so the slow"
"8324299","8327200"," of growth of government so the economy can catch up. "
"8327900","8329059"," That was a Democrat idea."
"8329059","8335280"," When we put work requirements in to help people get a job that's something Senator Biden voted for"
"8335280","8337379"," and President Clinton signed into law."
"8337760","8340160"," That was a Democrat supported idea too. "
"8340480","8347240"," So it's not my fault that the Democrats today had become so extreme so far to the socialist wing"
"8347240","8349920"," that they are now opposed to work requirements."
"8350400","8355160"," That they are now opposed to saving $1 less than he spent the year before."
"8355160","8358639"," That to me really seemed that the problem are the Democrats. "
"8358860","8362420"," The White House says they are trying to meet you half way."
"8362780","8367700"," So I mean at this stage of the game since you are at loggerheads what is the off ramp here?"
"8368040","8370840"," Look the off ramp here is to solve the problem."
"8371320","8373900"," To spend less than we spent last year. "
"8374100","8374820"," That's not that difficult."
"8375260","8376379"," They still want to spend more."
"8376780","8377680"," You cannot do that. "
"8378160","8379340"," No household would do that."
"8379600","8381459"," Look I explained this before."
"8382940","8384620"," Well they don't have a plan. "
"8384760","8385360"," They never passed anything."
"8385900","8389480"," So and you can't spend more money the next year than you spent this year."
"8389680","8391980"," Look I've been starting to get a squeeze here. "
"8392180","8395960"," The American people understand is having a credit card."
"8396540","8398340"," You raised and you hit the limit."
"8398900","8401820"," So year after year you just kept raising the limit. "
"8402240","8403480"," So you're paying more interest."
"8403740","8408320"," So now in America 17 cents out of every dollar comes in just goes to interest."
"8408320","8411120"," But now you owe so much on your credit card. "
"8411240","8412100"," You have to pay it."
"8412740","8415100"," But you owe more than you make in the entire year."
"8415520","8421560"," So now for America we owe more on our debt than our whole economy is worth. "
"8422020","8423040"," Twenty percent more."
"8424040","8425780"," So should you just raise the debt limit?"
"8426180","8428980"," Or should you literally think let's eliminate some waste."
"8429440","8432220"," If we had spent money billions of dollars. "
"8434540","8436540"," When I see this stuff I'm always like."
"8436840","8440540"," We can have a provision to help people find jobs."
"8441460","8442200"," Let's do that. "
"8442320","8445220"," So this speech right now is basically towards constituency."
"8446720","8450020"," We all know that Democrats or Republicans love spending money."
"8451200","8452060"," Let's do that. "
"8452540","8453560"," That's all we're asking."
"8453840","8454600"," We're being reasonable."
"8455440","8459320"," We're looking for here is will they make a deal or not make a deal. "
"8459320","8460780"," That's kind of like the key point here."
"8465480","8466920"," We've offered a lot of concessions."
"8467920","8470380"," The cap on the spending is a Democrat idea. "
"8470740","8474380"," The work requirement was a Democrat idea."
"8474660","8477020"," House Speaker McCarthy says we've offered a lot of concessions."
"8477480","8482820"," I can't help it if the Democrats have become so extreme and now is a party of Bernie Sanders then"
"8482820","8485140"," the party where Joe Biden was elected. "
"8485400","8487640"," Joe Biden is the president of the United States."
"8487640","8490280"," I'm a coffee at spending caps and work on Democrats."
"8491280","8492800"," Sanders is going to run their party. "
"8493220","8494100"," That's not my fault."
"8494500","8497040"," I'm not even sure Bernie Sanders is a registered Democrat."
"8497320","8507140"," If the president does not agree to pass this, first of all, your premise of your question is all"
"8507140","8507400"," wrong. "
"8508220","8511900"," When have I ever said you have to agree to 100% of what I want?"
"8512400","8516300"," All I've ever said to the president from February 1st, let's talk."
"8517080","8520760"," There's only a couple things I will not do, Mr. President."
"8521320","8522420"," I will not raise taxes. "
"8522880","8523160"," Why?"
"8524000","8530300"," Because we are bringing more revenue in, even to the GDP, not just to the 50-year average, but the"
"8530300","8531040"," history of America."
"8531620","8537080"," Only two other times have we brought in 20% of the GDP, 1944 and 2000."
"8538360","8541800"," I will not put a clean debt ceiling on the floor. "
"8541960","8542180"," Why?"
"8543340","8547160"," Because we've spent more than we've ever spent before and we have the highest debt than we ever had"
"8547160","8547340"," before."
"8547500","8548460"," I just don't think that's right."
"8548840","8550580"," Let me finish the question. "
"8551420","8554620"," And then I said to the president, but everything else is on the table."
"8555380","8556260"," For 97 days..."
"8556260","8559680"," Yes, how speaking with coffee says we want to put a clean debt ceiling on the floor?"
"8559680","8561260"," We're not getting everything in our bill."
"8563080","8564340"," I'm negotiating with the president. "
"8564840","8566800"," We passed a bill that raised the debt ceiling."
"8567600","8571180"," If I did what you're saying, we wouldn't be talking, but I sit..."
"8571180","8572480"," Can you imagine these jerk-offs?"
"8572960","8576980"," We get the Fed releasing the Fed minutes and these jerk-offs are like, let's have a little presser"
"8576980","8577560"," right on the day."
"8577660","8579000"," They already got some other shit going on. "
"8580040","8580580"," Don't come."
"8580720","8584720"," Well, and I know together, and maybe you discounted me too."
"8585080","8586780"," I didn't win Speaker on the first vote. "
"8587760","8588900"," It took 15 rounds."
"8589760","8590140"," You know what?"
"8590240","8591420"," I think we're stronger for it."
"8591860","8592640"," That's like all of them. "
"8592740","8593260"," That's like the Dems."
"8593500","8593780"," I don't care."
"8593980","8595400"," Dems are public and all that shit. "
"8595780","8597280"," But it took us 97 days."
"8597280","8600100"," I'm firmly believe that we'll be able to get there."
"8600160","8604080"," I'm going to go here yesterday to say that in session Denver cuts we're getting. "
"8604220","8604800"," I'm a coffee adding."
"8604960","8606320"," I believe we can get there."
"8606580","8610000"," So within the room there, what can you say?"
"8610080","8612940"," Yes, McCarthy is like saying that they can do a deal. "
"8613220","8616020"," I'm going to assume that a lot of this is political posturing at this point."
"8617340","8619720"," He's reiterated that three, four times."
"8620420","8625720"," I'm sure it's just pork barrels shit in the background for both Dems and for Republicans. "
"8627080","8628220"," Who's representing them?"
"8628860","8629600"," It's not my response."
"8629740","8632900"," And probably some, probably some stuff for constituents too, right?"
"8633080","8637300"," You know that the Republicans want to go back to their constituents and say, we cut all this shit"
"8637300","8638140"," that you want to see cut."
"8638640","8640080"," They would have done something on the border. "
"8640460","8643020"," It is not my fault they won't take action."
"8643500","8648120"," It is not my fault that the president would not meet with me for 97 days."
"8648420","8652880"," I'm sorry, but the moment he was willing to meet with me, I've been there each and every day. "
"8652880","8656560"," And I firmly believe we will get and solve this problem."
"8656560","8664820"," Mr. Speaker, how much time will you give your conference to read the debt ceiling bill once an"
"8664820","8665680"," agreement is reached?"
"8666100","8666680"," 72 hours."
"8666860","8674910"," Mr. Speaker, do you want to agree with that?"
"8674910","8682830"," If you don't agree with that, I can show you, if you don't agree with that statement, I can show"
"8682830","8684070"," you every debt ceiling, right?"
"8684070","8685310"," It just goes up, right?"
"8685850","8687270"," We know that it just goes up. "
"8688090","8689950"," So it's political posturing, right?"
"8690070","8693110"," You want to tell your constituents I'm fighting this, I'm fighting that."
"8693310","8696310"," Let me see if I can show you guys this."
"8697510","8699690"," So, you know, I want to show you guys this, right?"
"8700210","8701190"," So this has more to do. "
"8701290","8702130"," You can see this, right?"
"8702450","8704430"," Like I have to make my constituents happy."
"8704450","8706670"," I need to get the money that I need to get for my constituents."
"8707390","8711570"," Or at least I have to make the statements to appease my constituents. "
"8712530","8716230"," But you know that the debt ceiling continues to go up, right?"
"8716430","8717050"," No matter what."
"8718950","8719750"," Historically, right?"
"8720090","8722790"," So this is all most of this is political posturing."
"8723250","8727550"," The thing that you're looking for is can we get a deal done, not get a deal done, that kind"
"8727550","8728670"," of stuff outside of that?"
"8729930","8731670"," He's reiterating that a deal will get done. "
"8731870","8734450"," I'm assuming it's like two sided, right?"
"8735510","8739330"," For the deal to get done, we know that it's going to get raised."
"8740850","8746310"," But we also need to go back to our own constituents and say, yeah, I beat the Dems or I"
"8746310","8748670"," beat the Republicans or what the fuck it is they need to do."
"8749170","8750630"," I am not going to give up. "
"8751050","8752190"," We're not going to default."
"8752630","8753930"," We're going to solve this problem."
"8754330","8756870"," I will stay with it until we can get it done. "
"8756910","8758250"," He just said that we're not going to default."
"8759290","8762750"," We have to spend less than we spent last year."
"8763030","8766710"," It is not my fault that the Democrats cannot give up on their spending. "
"8766710","8770990"," And you would think that's the most revenue in the history of coming in."
"8771410","8774530"," But when the Democrats were in power, they spent the most money."
"8774750","8777470"," So we have the most expenses going out, the expenditures. "
"8778010","8779590"," It's not a revenue problem."
"8779770","8780590"," It's a spending problem."
"8781030","8782530"," And then you have the highest amount of debt. "
"8783250","8785930"," Don't you think that would finally wake them up to be sensible?"
"8786410","8789410"," Now, look, I don't want to point things out, but we have a new here with CNN."
"8789410","8797430"," I just heard on your news station that 60% of Americans believe the debt ceiling should only be"
"8797430","8799570"," raised after you found savings."
"8800330","8805210"," So to your question, your question, I think we're representing the American public. "
"8805490","8806670"," And that's what we'll continue to do."
"8807190","8807810"," I apologize."
"8808390","8809830"," I got to open up the house. "
"8810130","8811370"," I appreciate spending time with you."
"8811390","8813430"," So not too much to be gleaned from this."
"8813690","8817370"," It's the same as before the debt ceiling, the deal will get done. "
"8817370","8821490"," I'm going to assume at this point, just as before, nothing's really changed."
"8822330","8826570"," It's more just it's political posturing in my view to be able to go to your constituents and say,"
"8826790","8828970"," we cut these programs over here."
"8829090","8830670"," We cut those programs over there. "
"8831330","8833390"," So he just ended his news conference."
"8836410","8838230"," Nothing really changed at that point."
"8838490","8839770"," I think that's really it, right?"
"8840010","8846550"," The deal is that you're going to see like Biden go back to his constituents and say, we didn't bend"
"8846550","8848310"," and we won. "
"8849430","8854250"," And you're going to see Republicans go back to their constituents and say, we didn't bend and we"
"8854250","8854610"," won."
"8856070","8859610"," The key point here, you're trying to look and look, you're trying to look for."
"8861130","8864370"," You're trying to look for a deal can't get done something like that. "
"8865230","8868610"," That's kind of like what you're if you're if you're a bear, that's what you're really looking for."
"8870170","8871530"," Or at least for the initial reaction."
"8871530","8872270"," So no change. "
"8872270","8873470"," Nothing's changed at this point."
"8873830","8874910"," Kind of fascinating to see."
"8876370","8880430"," Kind of fascinating to see that news presser conference. "
"8881570","8882210"," On."
"8885110","8886770"," One here, let me check this here."
"8890200","8893520"," On fed minutes day, still have that. "
"8894060","8896760"," Still have this hanging out down below down here."
"8897400","8899360"," A little bit of supply down there."
"8899360","8901740"," We'll see if we can get down there at some point today. "
"8901840","8906620"," We'll see if we can get the hedge in the market for 2 p.m. And then we'll get the"
"8906620","8912660"," announcement from from from Fed Chair Powell as a bull."
"8913420","8915100"," You know, my preference is right."
"8915680","8916880"," More hawkish the better. "
"8918640","8922500"," The more defined bottom, the more the more chance we can go up at that point."
"8928780","8930040"," Yeah, I can't blame it."
"8930180","8932240"," I don't really blame either Democrats or Republicans. "
"8932420","8933740"," I'll be honest, I can't."
"8934040","8939340"," I can't blame Trump or or but like if it comes to the political side of things, I see it"
"8939340","8939960"," from like a me."
"8940240","8941800"," I don't see it from a main street hat anymore. "
"8942860","8946220"," See a lot of this stuff from like a trader hat or like a wall street hat."
"8946400","8946800"," So."
"8949200","8951540"," My political opinions like really don't. "
"8951680","8952920"," I don't really care about him as much anymore."
"8952920","8957140"," I mostly care about how it impacts making money and that kind of stuff."
"8958280","8960940"," I know that both like Republic like it's weird. "
"8961040","8964540"," I read like these articles where I was young and I read articles."
"8965180","8970020"," I didn't realize that a lot of that stuff had to do with our stock market, the treasury market."
"8971280","8977800"," Now as a market participant, I realized that a lot of this stuff is political theater for the"
"8977800","8978840"," fucking stock market, man. "
"8978840","8981900"," I feel like the world's best traders in there trying to make money, right?"
"8986000","8989240"," I have like I have pretty much no allegiance to either side."
"8996030","9003570"," Yeah, if I was like, if I wasn't a market participant, I would probably be one of those people."
"9003570","9009410"," I'd be like, yeah, you know, like fuck the Democrats or fuck three Republicans, all that kind of"
"9009410","9009650"," stuff. "
"9010590","9012390"," I don't trust either of them."
"9012390","9018730"," I think they're both some pretty nasty people."
"9027200","9029820"," So I just like, I don't get involved in a lot of that stuff anymore. "
"9030140","9031920"," I'm like, man."
"9034440","9036140"," Yeah, I got the trader hat on man."
"9036360","9042220"," Like when it comes to politics, I'm like fucking in like truly like that boy. "
"9042400","9043840"," I think that poison me."
"9044540","9047180"," Like being in the market like fucking poison me bad."
"9048620","9051240"," Probably the biggest poison out, but that's like the first poison. "
"9051300","9052980"," The second poison for me was."
"9054640","9058640"," Still have these gaps to fill down below four, eight, eight, four, nine, seven."
"9058880","9064600"," Can the bears get this by two p.m.? The first poison for me was when I was in the"
"9064600","9070580"," army and I was in the army and I was in a sitting in a."
"9071340","9075400"," In a con axe and they had like the FN shit on and. "
"9076500","9078440"," It didn't matter what channel is on."
"9078660","9080920"," Didn't matter if it was Fox or CNN or whatever."
"9082020","9086100"," Whatever they were saying to US citizens was absolutely fucking wrong. "
"9086380","9086740"," All of it."
"9087020","9089880"," The entire line that was sold to you guys was."
"9090460","9092840"," So whenever I watch the news doesn't matter if it's. "
"9092840","9096340"," Like an MSNBC fucking CNN or whatever."
"9096480","9098900"," I'm just like, yeah, that's really real."
"9098940","9101640"," The University of California, Santa Barbara. "
"9101960","9104940"," So text is expected as well as a Q and A from the moderator."
"9107140","9111720"," That's wild to see what you're told is and what's really happening."
"9113320","9117380"," Some of that's like, you know, because of security and stuff like that, but. "
"9119840","9121120"," That was kind of high opening."
"9121120","9124480"," Like when the when the when the veil is lifted on to you."
"9125780","9130160"," It's like when you actually sit in like a C suite or something with a CEO. "
"9130960","9133720"," Someone that makes a lot of money like millions and millions of dollars."
"9133740","9134200"," That kind of stuff."
"9134680","9137780"," You just get so many veils just lifted over your your head. "
"9137800","9140420"," When you hang out with people like that, they'll lift it over your head."
"9141900","9145460"," And you know, then when you then, of course, then your market participant, you're like."
"9146160","9150500"," I don't fucking believe any of these motherfuckers can believe any of them. "
"9160770","9164870"," Like my dad was a lobbyist, so I didn't really see it."
"9165490","9170630"," Like when I was a kid, I'd see these politicians on like a Sunday, they would show up at my"
"9170630","9171170"," dad's house."
"9172010","9173670"," They do like brunch and stuff. "
"9173850","9176250"," They go out and like have brunch with a priest."
"9177470","9180830"," Or like a mayor or they come over to our house and you'd see like."
"9181690","9187370"," Influential people having brunch together as a big one, like church on Sunday. "
"9187650","9193330"," And then you'd have the meeting of the people that make decisions and this was in Boston."
"9193890","9197890"," And Boston was a very famous politically corrupt city."
"9201450","9203770"," So, you know, you just see that growing up. "
"9203870","9206670"," I never had a cute awareness of all that stuff."
"9208050","9209290"," That was like the kids viewpoint."
"9210710","9215430"," So what you were trying to see in that presser was, is there a deal or is there no deal"
"9215430","9217250"," so far he's saying yes. "
"9218990","9224530"," My only assumption here is do does everybody get to go home and look like a hero?"
"9226010","9226810"," That's a big one."
"9231290","9232910"," Did they get to go home be a hero?"
"9244310","9246430"," All right, let's get back to business here."
"9249110","9252310"," Yeah, that's that really is usually what it is. "
"9253190","9255010"," Now, that's my take on it."
"9255050","9256730"," You guys don't have to agree with me on this stuff."
"9258670","9263990"," You know, so I try to parse like what's important to the market. "
"9271490","9273090"," Like what does that mean to the market?"
"9273090","9274970"," What is how does that impact the markets?"
"9275050","9276570"," Mark go up to the market down over that stuff."
"9277030","9278490"," Where are we at in this stuff?"
"9288460","9289840"," Let me know if you're long or short here."
"9290480","9291060"," Are you long?"
"9291400","9295780"," Are you like short a flat right now into this into these minutes?"
"9296260","9296940"," Or are you flat?"
"9297220","9298060"," Are you waiting a decision?"
"9299380","9301540"," Are you like bearish air bullish air?"
"9303300","9308220"," Do you think we have just one more capitulation move and then we're back to trend again or we're"
"9308220","9309420"," still on trend right now?"
"9310220","9311840"," To the upside believe it or not. "
"9312020","9314100"," I know that sounds crazy to say, but we are."
"9317600","9319680"," Are you like are you like market meltdown?"
"9321940","9324040"," You're like all the bad news is out."
"9324040","9327700"," Are you just looking for a dip to buy?"
"9328900","9330220"," Are we getting more bullish?"
"9330420","9331600"," I'm getting more bearish. "
"9332040","9332880"," I don't know."
"9333080","9335000"," The news is getting the best of me."
"9335000","9336240"," I don't know exactly what. "
"9373920","9375340"," The straddles aren't too bad."
"9375500","9376640"," I like the idea of the straddles."
"9376700","9377960"," I've been running those a lot lately. "
"9379880","9381980"," So like my view like past week."
"9382260","9382960"," I've been doing it."
"9383200","9384080"," Matter of fact, I've been doing it. "
"9384140","9387000"," I did that when we were trading sideways at the 412."
"9388280","9391260"," I was like, I'll take a call or a put."
"9391640","9392980"," And if it goes the opposite way. "
"9394000","9397260"," Then my in my thesis, I throw the other side on."
"9397500","9398620"," So let's say I'm in like puts."
"9400200","9402200"," 50 cents and they get out of 10 cents. "
"9402560","9407880"," I'll throw the call side on and try to make back on the other side for a move like a"
"9407880","9408960"," move down or a move up."
"9408960","9410380"," And it's been printing pretty well."
"9410480","9411700"," I've been making decent money doing that. "
"9417460","9421160"," Yeah, the straddles have been doing me really well, especially on the zero dates because they're so"
"9421160","9421480"," cheap."
"9422040","9424140"," This stream is sponsored by ticks right."
"9424460","9425220"," I caught a few times. "
"9425520","9428020"," There's two times I think a week or two ago."
"9428480","9430380"," We got fucking pinned right in a close."
"9430380","9436220"," I got fucked like two times, but the trade like seven, like seven out of 10 times. "
"9436220","9437140"," If I get caught."
"9437840","9439000"," It's been very profitable."
"9448790","9450050"," Yeah, you're in a straddle too. "
"9451770","9452870"," The straddle's been good."
"9453090","9454130"," The straddle like the past."
"9455650","9456830"," What is it?"
"9457030","9458990"," 30, 40 trading sessions, whatever we're trading sideways. "
"9459950","9461150"," And like I don't see a trade."
"9461350","9463110"," I'm like, I don't know if it's up or down here."
"9463230","9463850"," We could go either way. "
"9465650","9467730"," I'll be like, yeah, my bias is put."
"9468390","9470590"," So I take the put that goes my way."
"9470730","9471430"," Whoo hoo, making money. "
"9472250","9474130"," If it doesn't go my way and I throw the straddle on."
"9474930","9479270"," It actually pays for the bad call or the bad put or the bad call that I made."
"9480010","9484090"," And sometimes even prints at least 100% after paying for all that shit. "
"9484730","9489750"," So this sideways market has been a really good for straddle sellers and straddle buyers."
"9501420","9503620"," Yeah, John's doing an artificial straddle right now."
"9505080","9507140"," Yeah, it's been a really good fucking trade recently. "
"9512920","9514300"," Let's talk about one more thing."
"9514580","9517520"," So I talk about this during most of our events."
"9518960","9522260"," So I want to highlight it again for you as a trader. "
"9523780","9526540"," So when we come into these events right here, okay."
"9528420","9530700"," There's a couple things that are going to happen."
"9530700","9532380"," Almost always. "
"9534020","9536360"," We're going to review them again right now."
"9538360","9544600"," Regardless of the bearishness that you see out there currently or the bullishness that you saw last"
"9544600","9544900"," week."
"9545760","9549960"," When we come into these events, oftentimes two things happen. "
"9550940","9555840"," The dealers know that you are like Max shorts or Max long."
"9557160","9562880"," Even if I like I'll sometimes look in the chain and I'm like, man, it's really bearish right now."
"9562920","9567940"," But everybody's long as fuck on calls right or everybody's really bullish right now. "
"9568700","9574240"," But everybody's Max long on puts right something like that right trying to get an idea across to"
"9574240","9574360"," you."
"9575060","9584180"," When we come into these events, the dealers have gotten better at managing them as we come into the"
"9584180","9584920"," day of the event."
"9584920","9588540"," So we'll come into an event today is the 24th, right?"
"9588680","9589060"," We have an event. "
"9590900","9596180"," And we have what I've been noticing the past three or four minutes, maybe like the past four or"
"9596180","9596740"," five events."
"9596900","9600080"," So I first started noticing that one side would be lopsided."
"9600780","9602700"," Then both sides became lopsided. "
"9603520","9606020"," Then the dealers started jacking up the price to play."
"9607660","9612000"," So let's say a 10 or 20 delta zero date would normally be."
"9612840","9615060"," 10 20 not 10 like 30 cents. "
"9615060","9616700"," Let's say in a spy option."
"9617480","9622780"," And then in that event, they're magically 60 cents 90 cents, right?"
"9623720","9625380"," Put side same kind of a thing."
"9626460","9631220"," So you've got a premium built into both sides now. "
"9631620","9632640"," It used to be one side."
"9632640","9634920"," You'd have premium built in about the other, but right now it's like everything."
"9635700","9639140"," And oftentimes a lot of times recently, right?"
"9639140","9644400"," We're not getting the initial move to move where you expect it to move. "
"9645000","9647160"," So there's like a failure to hit your target."
"9649080","9650400"," We can hit it afterwards."
"9652160","9654480"," But if you're unlike zero dates or that kind of stuff. "
"9656000","9659640"," Right now, specifically, let's say we get a bullish move here, right?"
"9659960","9665720"," A two PM says he does not support stopping rate hikes unless there is clear evidence inflation is"
"9665720","9667720"," moving down to the two percent target."
"9667720","9672720"," So it's the decision whether to hike rates or skip hike at the June meeting will depend on data"
"9672720","9674280"," over the next three weeks."
"9674620","9680040"," And Fed's Wallace does not expect data in the next couple of months to make it clear, to make it"
"9680040","9682000"," clear the terminal interest rate has been reached. "
"9682620","9684780"," And says he is concerned about the lack of progress on inflation."
"9685800","9691120"," It says more loosening of very tight labor market needs to be seen to help take the heat of"
"9691120","9691720"," inflation."
"9691720","9697200"," And says the April PCE inflation and may CPI data will be critical. "
"9697840","9702520"," It says his concern inflation won't come down much unless the growth of average hourly earning"
"9702520","9704120"," wages near three percent."
"9704500","9707080"," It's fighting inflation that continues to be his priority."
"9707740","9711780"," That's Wallace as there is higher than usual uncertainty about credit conditions. "
"9714500","9717380"," So that was an early text release for Fed's Waller there."
"9721370","9725390"," Remember that we have the GDP second reading tomorrow."
"9725530","9728270"," We've got claims at eight thirty, both of those eight thirty in the morning. "
"9728890","9730910"," Depending home sales, I think those do improve."
"9731370","9733130"," Believe it or not, you're not going to believe that, but that's true."
"9734770","9738710"," PCE big news Friday eight thirty AM, right?"
"9740750","9745010"," Just stating now they're looking at the PCE data that comes out on Friday. "
"9745870","9748690"," So that's more volatility in the end of this week on Friday."
"9748850","9753370"," So if you're looking for that big bull trade, it might be after on Friday, right?"
"9754350","9761010"," You've got all these puts in the money into Friday and they're going to try to kill them in Friday."
"9761010","9765670"," So if you're a bull and you're looking for the real ripper up, Friday is like a day that you"
"9765670","9768010"," can like maybe bet on, right?"
"9768930","9770030"," Friday would be that day. "
"9770030","9776670"," If you got good news today in these minutes and if the Fed is not going to make a move"
"9776670","9783370"," on those, even if it was bullish, you might get like a false rip up higher than options get"
"9783370","9784190"," reprised."
"9784670","9786570"," This is back to my original conversation here."
"9787430","9790090"," So you get like this rip higher on good news in the minutes. "
"9790790","9792930"," They'd fail and then maybe go up here."
"9793250","9794370"," They reprised your calls."
"9795330","9798010"," Let's say you bought them at a dollar down here, right?"
"9798470","9801110"," You fail to close in time. "
"9801610","9803970"," They go to like let's say $1.75 or something."
"9804530","9805510"," This works for puts too."
"9806650","9810030"," You know, you get like $1.75. You're like, I'm diamond here. "
"9810150","9810750"," This is great news."
"9811290","9811510"," They fail."
"9811690","9812270"," Come back down. "
"9812450","9813370"," They reprice the options."
"9813370","9814690"," We consolidate sideways."
"9815270","9819190"," Then we get the move higher and they are like reprised to 20 cents. "
"9820170","9823230"," We get the move, but your options are now only worth 75 cents."
"9823370","9824010"," So be aware of that."
"9824170","9827230"," This is also holds true for the put side. "
"9827230","9829250"," You get that bloodbath down."
"9829450","9831210"," We close the gap down below."
"9831410","9834250"," We tag S3 and it's a failure, right?"
"9834850","9838290"," You go down here, we close this stuff up and we just fail to hit that. "
"9839070","9841110"," They reprice the puts, right?"
"9841430","9845050"," Then they make their move down lower and you're kind of fucked in there."
"9845710","9852430"," If you're considering trading these events, it's sometimes better for you to buy them, buy your"
"9852430","9855130"," spreads or spreads number one are awesome."
"9855130","9859470"," The second issue here would be time on your calls or puts. "
"9860210","9864750"," You place them out a couple of weeks to a couple of month out maybe for that directional move that"
"9864750","9865530"," you're looking for."
"9867130","9872010"," There can also be outsized moves if there is an outsized move in this event, right?"
"9872990","9875030"," Let's say we blast down on the depths of hell."
"9875290","9881350"," It'll tend to mean revert back so we can continue on the track even if it's down like that outsized"
"9881350","9884070"," move and can also retrace itself. "
"9884070","9890250"," So I always recommend to people to be careful when you trade these events."
"9890670","9894090"," You heard John Hagerty saying he's straddled here, Chaz said he was straddled."
"9894390","9900850"," It's a difficult trade to manage in the heat of the moment, but they do usually print pretty well. "
"9901510","9904990"," You can get up and get up and blast out into the minutes, right?"
"9905310","9910190"," You close the puts, blast back up, close the calls and you make double the money."
"9910510","9911390"," Make a lot of money actually."
"9911390","9914110"," You got to get it done though before they reprice that shit. "
"9914390","9916850"," It's like one move down, one move up, close them both."
"9917650","9919710"," One move up, one move down, close them both."
"9920270","9922910"," They reprice and then rethink your positioning. "
"9923810","9929710"," If you're someone that wants to buy like a month out calls or month out puts, this is not the"
"9929710","9933750"," time to buy them because they're pricing premium into this event."
"9933750","9941290"," The moment the vol kicks off of this event is the right time to start considering farther out"
"9941290","9941750"," options."
"9942830","9945670"," We know we still have vol on Friday on PCE. "
"9947110","9952410"," So even if we did get a bounce today, I'm going to expect us to roll back down into the"
"9952410","9953850"," PCE, right?"
"9954450","9958830"," And then await that news and then you get like, you get that, you like to wrap it up over"
"9958830","9962130"," the weekend, Memorial Day liquidity leaves the market."
"9962410","9965790"," And then all of a sudden you get that face repair into June 1st, June 2nd."
"9967250","9971070"," So just be aware about this stuff that we got Memorial Day coming up. "
"9971750","9974150"," Probably get like a debt ceiling deal done."
"9974310","9975570"," Everybody goes home and kisses babies."
"9976410","9978990"," You're going to have less trading in the market. "
"9979150","9981550"," You're going to have people saying, Hey, I made it all up to 420."
"9982010","9986890"," Hey, we got all the way back down to a really or a cooling off period, right?"
"9986890","9992530"," We've got it all the way down to 408, 404, 412, and they're going to place their bets."
"9992710","9997170"," They're going to walk away into next week, you know, you'll be left hanging high and dry here into"
"9997170","9997470"," this week. "
"9997470","10000550"," And I assure you, you're going to be screaming in the dark."
"10000730","10002350"," If you're a bull or a bear, you're going to be screaming."
"10002590","10003730"," I don't care which side you're on. "
"10004310","10007350"," And there's going to be nobody listening because everybody's going on vacation."
"10008110","10008290"," Okay."
"10012330","10016030"," You're going to be like begging for like news and you're going to be begging for. "
"10016690","10023370"," You know, anything, uh, Wall Street traders required to have their laptops with them over Memorial"
"10023370","10024070"," Day weekend."
"10025090","10026470"," On fear of doom and gloom."
"10026850","10029710"," That kind of shit, you know, you're going to be the only one trading that shit. "
"10030910","10033970"," Just be aware that we're getting long in the tooth and time."
"10035450","10040130"," For like big breaking news vacations coming up for people."
"10045110","10046010"," Market closed. "
"10048690","10055690"," Set it house of reps at the Hamptons hanging out down on Tivy Island."
"10056130","10057290"," Probably not Tivy Island."
"10057390","10062070"," They're probably going to be hanging out down at, um, where's that great golf course down and"
"10062070","10063070"," what's that island called?"
"10063850","10067710"," Was it not a Palm something down there and down there in Georgia?"
"10067710","10070210"," Here are that great, uh, that great golfing is. "
"10070410","10071410"," I used to go golfing down there."
"10077500","10082820"," So if you're like, if you're all like cuckamed up right now on news, do not expect it."
"10083040","10085280"," Like after Friday, wrap it up. "
"10090770","10091990"," No, not Hilton head."
"10092870","10094130"," Uh, what is it called?"
"10095630","10096350"," It's a very expensive."
"10096610","10098650"," It's down in, um, maybe it's South Carolina. "
"10098990","10099650"," Is it South Carolina?"
"10099650","10101830"," Maybe South Carolina."
"10102510","10104630"," Uh, south of Charleston."
"10105750","10107990"," There was a great place to golf down there. "
"10110190","10111050"," Kewa baby."
"10112310","10113870"," Dylobard knows what I'm talking about."
"10114270","10115250"," Kewa Island. "
"10115690","10116850"," That's the shit down there."
"10118470","10119290"," I've been there."
"10119970","10121050"," Kewa, I got invited there. "
"10121250","10122410"," I went there once, I should say."
"10123310","10126950"," I was invited there by some like some old school money and it was great."
"10132930","10135810"," So some targets for today, right?"
"10135970","10137110"," It is a 12 17. "
"10137830","10143830"," You can see the hedge on the market for the event."
"10144350","10148290"," You know that the volatility should come off the event."
"10149170","10152570"," This ball right now is, you know, trader ball, right?"
"10152850","10153450"," Hedge fund ball. "
"10154690","10156930"," Some targets to the up and down."
"10162890","10165730"," The bear's right here."
"10165910","10166670"," Close this gap. "
"10168190","10172790"," If we're able to trade down below S3 and hold it."
"10173650","10175690"," Your target is 404 403."
"10176310","10177430"," Do I think you get there today?"
"10177790","10178290"," Unlikely. "
"10178950","10182070"," If you do get there today, you're going to make my entire week."
"10183030","10185710"," You're making me very happy because I'm going to buy the fuck out of that dip."
"10186330","10189790"," So if we do get down to that 404 403, that's that weekly trigger. "
"10192950","10193950"," Right down here."
"10194030","10195070"," If we can get that, right?"
"10195210","10198690"," There's one more beautiful 403 72."
"10199650","10201310"," Keep that on your radar down here. "
"10201390","10204590"," If you're a bear, I'm looking for this."
"10205030","10206750"," Personally, I want to see this."
"10207990","10213090"," The more down I can get, the happier that I'm going to be and safer that I'm going to feel. "
"10213090","10215410"," Get it like that nice capitulation move."
"10215990","10217410"," One quick bloodbath."
"10217650","10221550"," If I don't get this until Friday, I can't take. "
"10222070","10223330"," Can't take like the."
"10223850","10224890"," Yeah, I'm happy trade."
"10225030","10225670"," Like I want this. "
"10225670","10226490"," Yeah, I'm happy trade."
"10227650","10228650"," It might get greedy."
"10228890","10230030"," I always get greedy down here. "
"10230070","10235630"," I never like I never get my sometimes I miss these trades and wind up chasing."
"10236750","10237230"," Right."
"10237570","10239490"," That and it still wouldn't shock me to see. "
"10240050","10242150"," So we got Wednesday, Thursday, Friday."
"10243750","10248130"," Even if you get that capitulation trade down here, you can see some bullshit like this."
"10248770","10251610"," And then come back down and retest on Friday again. "
"10251810","10252910"," One percent on the session."
"10253470","10253630"," Right."
"10253850","10256710"," So even as a bull, you might be like, yeah, I want that trade. "
"10256890","10259270"," And then it dies off in a Friday for PCE."
"10259710","10263470"," And the real trade would be Friday or Monday for June 2nd and 1st."
"10263650","10264930"," So just be aware of that as a bull. "
"10265670","10267490"," We are already already down here."
"10267630","10269930"," There's no reason for us not to do this."
"10269930","10270890"," So we're going up to 420. "
"10271670","10272110"," Right."
"10272330","10272910"," We're going up there."
"10272970","10273730"," I'm like, there's no reason. "
"10273730","10274590"," We're already up here."
"10274650","10275230"," We're going to 420."
"10275630","10275670"," Right. "
"10276450","10281910"," If we start trading 420 to 427 or 430, there's no reason for us not to go up there."
"10281910","10282170"," Right."
"10282950","10286710"," So for the bears right now, I hope and pray we can get down here to 408. "
"10287830","10292890"," If we don't get 404 to 50 today, I would appreciate if we could get it on Friday, of course."
"10293750","10297010"," And then have like PCE data come in really good."
"10297010","10299190"," They're going to pause the rate increases. "
"10300170","10303770"," We've got the, you know, we've got the fed on the fence about all this shit."
"10303910","10306950"," I don't know if we get this or not, but if we do, so be it."
"10308130","10310830"," If we get crazy news today, good news today. "
"10312190","10315270"," I still expect a rejection off this daily trigger."
"10315450","10317370"," This is going to be a difficult one to get through."
"10318050","10319310"," It's not going to be easy. "
"10320570","10322050"," Not going to be easy at all."
"10322230","10322390"," Right."
"10322810","10323950"," Absolutely not going to be easy. "
"10323950","10331270"," And the other crazy thing is there's the hourly trigger and that is hauling ass down here."
"10331790","10332390"," Hauling ass."
"10333850","10340470"," It's now at 412.48. So look at that. "
"10340590","10341110"," It's just moving."
"10341490","10341870"," Oh, excuse me."
"10342070","10345570"," 414.28. It's now down here. "
"10345690","10346870"," It's like creeping in the background."
"10348530","10351970"," Like you're all beared up and you're like, you're, you're all beared up right now and you're like,"
"10351970","10352890"," we're going to the depths of hell."
"10353870","10357590"," And what's coming down here is the hourly trigger. "
"10358050","10362370"," There are bulls out there that can see this."
"10362510","10364270"," Now, if you're a bull, this is when you listen up, okay?"
"10365410","10367330"," Wait, listen up this if you're a bull, okay?"
"10368410","10370590"," There are these sneaky little bulls in the background."
"10370970","10374190"," They're just looking for a dip to buy and I'm just going to tell you right now what they're looking"
"10374190","10374550"," for. "
"10375410","10379210"," These fucking bulls are waiting for this hourly trigger to just make its way down here."
"10383880","10385320"," Yeah, mute this real quick."
"10388240","10389580"," These sneaky little bulls. "
"10389640","10390660"," It's just like the bears, right?"
"10391680","10393360"," Sneaky little bulls, sneaky little bears."
"10396100","10402880"," And now as we're getting all bearish down here, you're going to be, you're going to be watching"
"10402880","10411720"," this come down and these bulls are looking for any kind of capitulation, price to get above the"
"10411720","10415160"," hour and the daily and for the one in five minutes to come underneath."
"10416060","10418560"," This will turn into a bull cluster to the upside. "
"10419120","10420860"," Be aware of this if you're a bear, I guess."
"10421040","10423460"," If you see that shit, get out of the way."
"10424180","10427080"," Get the fuck out of the way if you see that right there. "
"10427220","10435300"," If you see the one, the five, the hour and the daily and price breaks above and holds here."
"10435340","10436520"," This is just like the bears."
"10436520","10440860"," If this holds, this shit will explode to the upside. "
"10441520","10446700"," So just be conscious of it today, be a conscious of it Thursday and Friday that it's in the"
"10446700","10446980"," background."
"10448220","10453640"," Tying this all together right now, wrapping this whole entire speech up."
"10457320","10458580"," This is the magic. "
"10458760","10459820"," This is where the magic happens."
"10463100","10465680"," Right here, baby, this is the VIX."
"10466880","10468800"," What is the VIX telling us?"
"10470460","10472340"," This is where the magic happens, right?"
"10473760","10475280"," Yeah, price coming up. "
"10477020","10478220"," Checked the weekly."
"10479900","10480940"," Checked the weekly."
"10482040","10484540"," Price now trading above the one in five. "
"10485520","10487080"," What does that mean to you?"
"10487380","10489600"," It means we're bullish on the VIX."
"10490780","10496140"," Unless the VIX breaks below 20, bullish on the VIX to the upside."
"10498140","10502200"," 22, I like to when I say this shit, bears like, yeah, I agree. "
"10502920","10504300"," They've talked about Tesla."
"10504660","10505860"," They're like, no, no, I don't agree."
"10506840","10507100"," Right?"
"10507280","10507840"," I promise you. "
"10508180","10512100"," When you see this right here, I'm bullish above 20 bucks."
"10512580","10518500"," I'm looking for a price target above of a minimum of about $23."
"10519240","10522960"," There is the potential to squeeze slightly higher. "
"10523980","10526840"," We'll look at that in a larger time frame here."
"10529500","10531900"," You see that better now?"
"10533300","10536660"," As long as price holds here, I'm bullish VIX."
"10538360","10540480"," Right here, 23 bucks or so. "
"10541340","10545080"," There's probably some bears out there saying we can go higher than this monthly."
"10545880","10551640"," If we do, it would typically be a squeeze above, like the will coming above the clouds and doing"
"10551640","10558120"," the sound, come back down, and you'll still want to see the confirmation that we're going higher."
"10558980","10559160"," Okay?"
"10559340","10563880"," So you're going to be looking for this if we can break 2350. "
"10564220","10565820"," If you're a bear out there, okay?"
"10566220","10568520"," So we'll monitor this as the rest of the day goes forward."
"10568840","10571160"," You can see right now we are bullish the VIX."
"10571300","10572400"," We are bearish the spy. "
"10572960","10577920"," I'm going to give you that that will thing above, and I got this already tagged above right here."
"10578560","10582640"," From previous examples, we'll let me say I put a lot of lines up in here for you."
"10585160","10587060"," So we've got this one right here. "
"10588540","10589600"," Right, 2138."
"10593140","10596820"," We've got this one right here, 2288 is my PT."
"10597640","10601980"," And then some kind of a failure right here. "
"10602280","10611660"," So you'd see like, you'd see like the blast up, come down, bounce around, and hopefully try to tag"
"10611660","10616180"," 24 at 70, and maybe even make an attempt for that 30 bucks."
"10617120","10618320"," No debt ceiling deal."
"10620220","10622220"," Remember we used to trade 20 to 30. "
"10623420","10625060"," Remember we're in a volatile market."
"10625060","10626460"," Do you guys remember those days?"
"10627840","10629440"," Bears are like, just give me 30."
"10629960","10630860"," Give me a new high. "
"10633180","10635220"," I'm like, we used to get 30 every day."
"10635780","10637520"," We used to get 40s and 50s."
"10640680","10643180"," Your no debt ceiling deal is up here. "
"10643980","10647680"," Anything above 30 bucks to 40 or 50 is no debt ceiling deal."
"10648080","10650360"," I don't know, burning tires in New York City, that kind of stuff."
"10653340","10658380"," We've got nice bullishness in the weekly, nice bullishness in the quarterly, nice bullishness in"
"10658380","10660480"," the daily, getting a little toppy on the daily. "
"10660480","10664640"," You can see it here in a little toppy, a little long in the tooth for the bears."
"10667760","10670520"," 2288 is my target for today."
"10670980","10672140"," 2288 for the VIX. "
"10673040","10675160"," So I'm going to get this off two numbers to you."
"10675320","10676180"," Watch the VIX in the background."
"10677080","10679100"," $20.07 must hold. "
"10679580","10681560"," Price target above 2288."
"10688420","10690060"," Keep your eyes on that today."
"10698980","10706380"," Yeah, I'd like to see that like 2288 and then like have us tag like S3 or that last little"
"10706380","10708420"," thing down here, like this bad boy right here. "
"10710040","10711900"," This little hot saucy thing right here."
"10711980","10713660"," Maybe I should look behind and try to find more."
"10714000","10714860"," I think there's a gap. "
"10716100","10717240"," I'm just going to find that gap."
"10717460","10719860"," I don't know why this isn't showing up."
"10720100","10721200"," That is showing up. "
"10722020","10725420"," It's right here, 403.72, that previous high right there."
"10726920","10728200"," Previous high right here."
"10728860","10733440"," Right down there, 403.74. Right down there. "
"10734120","10735820"," I'd love to see the, I don't care where the VIX is."
"10735920","10744700"," I don't care if it's 23 or 30, but I'm going to look for those levels in where we are"
"10744700","10745060"," in there."
"10745220","10746400"," That'd be like the kick ass trade. "
"10758440","10759160"," Oh, yeah."
"10759240","10760740"," Look at that big old gap right there."
"10761660","10767360"," There's a gap above, left the gap behind at 4.19.42. This would be the trade above on the"
"10767360","10768340"," four checker bear cluster. "
"10768640","10775380"," The our bull cluster of the upside closed those gaps at 4.20. Like that trade too."
"10778980","10780620"," Like that trade a lot."
"10780620","10781780"," You'll be fucking awesome. "
"10782000","10782400"," Like 404."
"10782540","10787400"," Then we close the gap at 4.20. Get some range."
"10793440","10795140"," There's your S3 right there. "
"10799280","10801480"," We'll move that hourly trigger as higher."
"10801720","10802240"," It's right now."
"10802380","10802640"," It's a."
"10804220","10805260"," Or 1428. "
"10805520","10806020"," It's way up here."
"10809160","10810380"," It's creeping down though."
"10810460","10811180"," It's creeping down here. "
"10815020","10815960"," There we go."
"10817380","10818180"," Excuse me."
"10821810","10822790"," Drop and give me 2000. "
"10823850","10825950"," I know that's like the total bear porn, right?"
"10828250","10829630"," I was like seeing that shit."
"10829770","10830070"," I'm like."
"10831450","10834110"," People are like, there'll be no debt sailing deal. "
"10834330","10837130"," And I'm like, dude, I'm like, how much fucking money do you make a year?"
"10838870","10840350"," I'm like, do you make 300 grand a year?"
"10841090","10844070"," I'm like, do you own like four or five properties?"
"10845050","10846390"," Debt free of it too."
"10846450","10847710"," Just you just own all that shit."
"10848850","10852090"," Like is all of your debt paid off?"
"10852650","10854730"," Do you buy a car with cash?"
"10859430","10864950"," If you aren't that guy, you should not be calling for that, that situation. "
"10868370","10870850"," Do you have a compound in Montana with 7,000 acres?"
"10874450","10875250"," Probably not."
"10875250","10881750"," Do you have like 100 immediate 300 immediate family members?"
"10881990","10882530"," All that money."
"10883490","10884970"," A ranch in the middle of Montana. "
"10885150","10885750"," Do you have all that?"
"10885930","10888370"," Because if you don't, I bet you don't."
"10888510","10889070"," It's like not you."
"10889830","10892970"," I bet like we like a thousand people, maybe one of them does. "
"10895630","10897070"," It's always funny."
"10897310","10902090"," It's like when you find out the people that are actually calling for that, you're like, oh, that"
"10902090","10904330"," fucking guy makes like 50k a year."
"10904610","10906770"," Fucking guys paying a rent or paying a mortgage. "
"10907830","10910510"," Fucking guys like working two jobs or something."
"10911330","10916790"," That fucking guy wants, doesn't know it, but wants a debt sailing deal signed."
"10918250","10923030"," The only people getting fucked in that thing is like poor and people that think that they're rich. "
"10933350","10934630"," How's IV looking at options?"
"10935710","10937950"," Yeah, there's a hedge in the market right now."
"10940110","10941450"," I want to see the hedge lift."
"10941710","10945590"," If you want calls here, I'll give you the last part here. "
"10946030","10955130"," If you're like a bull in the stream and you want to trade the reversal, at home, put a 27"
"10955130","10957190"," and I think I have this at a one 29."
"10957370","10958530"," One 29 right now."
"10958630","10959830"," Folks have now scolted. "
"10960470","10963010"," Set up an EMA for 27 and one 29."
"10963750","10965110"," You have no trade."
"10966150","10969870"," If you're asking me, like when can we buy a dip?"
"10970570","10973310"," I already know that you don't know what you like when to buy a dip. "
"10973410","10973770"," That's okay."
"10973890","10974530"," It's not a bad thing."
"10975710","10979150"," You literally have you pretty much have no business buying a dip. "

"10992990","10994610"," Like if we squeezed up right now."
"11001020","11002740"," Let's say we know maybe next."
"11003160","11006360"," Let's say we squeezed up right here and you're like, Oh, Captain, getting long. "
"11007400","11008180"," That trade right there."
"11008220","11009880"," You probably have no business taking that trade."
"11010920","11014360"," If we squeezed up here, you probably have no business taking that trade. "
"11015320","11018960"," You really want to like wait until you confirm the move higher."
"11019380","11023140"," Because this trade would last for a day, two days, three days."
"11024400","11028100"," Like this is where you enter most people like most most. "
"11029940","11033520"," Like 60, 70% of people out there, they're looking for that right there."
"11033740","11034740"," You don't you don't see that."
"11034860","11035340"," You don't have a trade. "
"11035740","11036420"," Be honest with you."
"11036480","11036700"," You don't."
"11038240","11040640"," I'm not going to trade one minute charts with you guys here anymore. "
"11040640","11041520"," I'm done with that shit."
"11043020","11047320"," Like I don't like when I trade, like I do take one minute trades in the background, but I don't"
"11047320","11048540"," tell you guys about them."
"11049380","11050980"," You fucking guys get the trade. "
"11051180","11053420"," Like the time I execute the trade, I'm clicking the button."
"11053880","11055240"," Let's say I get a trade of 10 cents."
"11056500","11057900"," And then I tell you. "
"11058240","11062560"," And then four seconds later, you get down the trade and then you execute it."
"11062640","11064400"," That's like 15 seconds later."
"11065000","11066320"," I'm in for like 10 cents. "
"11066320","11067140"," You're in for 20."
"11067340","11067960"," I'm out of 30."
"11068820","11071540"," You don't you don't pull the trigger to solid 40. "
"11071700","11072840"," Then it's back down to 10."
"11073000","11073900"," You're getting torched."
"11074660","11077460"," These are like one minute chart trades, scalping trades. "
"11077600","11078980"," I don't do that shit with you guys anymore."
"11079700","11080640"," Five minute charts."
"11082520","11083800"," That's what you guys get from me. "
"11086080","11094780"," Yeah, I'm just looking for that."
"11094980","11095720"," I mean, that's me too."
"11095880","11099000"," Like someone said, I went by puts air like, you know, there's a hedge in the market. "
"11099000","11100960"," You know, they're going to lift it at some point."
"11101320","11103220"," If you're a bull, you're looking for a reversal."
"11103900","11105900"," If you're a bull, you're looking for a major bottom. "
"11106120","11106840"," That's what you're looking for."

"11108460","11110160"," Those are the two things you're looking for as a bull. "
"11116540","11120520"," If you're in a really fast trader and you can't, you can't, you don't understand the mechanics of a"
"11120520","11120980"," straddle."
"11121060","11123220"," You probably don't have a trade for that either unless you're a trader."
"11134000","11135160"," Did I miss S3?"
"11135780","11136720"," The fuck was I thinking?"
"11152640","11155060"," Clean up that chart for the day for you guys right there. "
"11162590","11166070"," What I love to buy the dip at 500 on SPX."
"11166350","11170630"," No, like you guys, you guys, I want you guys to know, man, we have a whole entire trading community"

"12266580","12268300"," You won't see me on fin to it. "
"12268300","12270060"," Normally I disappear that weekend."

"12299800","12303540"," Stock market will be closed on the 29th. "
"12303700","12308780"," So be aware of that when you're placing your bets for theta burn over that weekend."

"12315020","12318600"," If you are bearish here, just like when we're at 420. "
"12319420","12321160"," I'm going to repeat this one more time."
"12322300","12326980"," So when we run a high, I talk to you about ratio spreads, put back spreads."
"12327960","12330940"," I'm going to speak to you once more about put back spreads. "
"12331600","12334140"," We're now trading on a low down here at 410."
"12334400","12335660"," We could possibly go down to 404."
"12336660","12341680"," We're getting close to a place where if you're one of the believers in market crash, or debt"
"12341680","12344760"," ceiling rolls the market down 500 points. "
"12345100","12350200"," This is another great place for you to put on a ratio or a put back spread."
"12350960","12352960"," If on good news, we blast up to 430."
"12354140","12357040"," You will not, you know, cost you nothing. "
"12357500","12358820"," You'll make a little bit of money."
"12360060","12365800"," If we blast down to, I think they're calling for, I think we've renegotiated a market crash to"
"12365800","12366560"," 3600."
"12367240","12369760"," You'll print for 500%. "
"12370580","12375160"," So just as we're down here right now at the 410 level."
"12377240","12383800"," You might want to reconsider rolling, repositioning those put back ratio spreads."
"12392420","12397760"," So in five minutes time now at the top of the hour, us is due to sell $43 billion in"
"12397760","12398460"," five year notes. "
"12398460","12403400"," A private to cover with two to 54 with the prior high yield of three spot five percent."
"12403920","12407500"," I love saying the shit about put back like the put back spreads always get me."
"12408060","12410980"," My is like, we're at a place to put them on. "
"12411440","12413020"," I'm going to come back a week later, Mike."
"12413480","12414420"," Didn't any of you have a mind?"

"12432350","12433590"," So bros, baby."
"12441840","12443200"," Yeah, I see that too, Johnny. "
"12445000","12446220"," I see that too, man."
"12446380","12451280"," I see that like initial rip higher than blast back down, slam down to that four, four, four, eight,"
"12451420","12452040"," retest it."
"12452800","12455020"," Consolidate sideways and then we get the actual move. "
"12457060","12458840"," Just shake the fuck out of people."
"12458840","12464520"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"12464680","12465780"," Put back spreads through there. "
"12465880","12471920"," Like save my ass."

"12474480","12475940"," I fucking love them. "
"12478440","12479860"," You don't even have to be right."
"12480260","12481240"," You don't even fucking care."
"12481880","12488920"," Well, you need enough time on them in case we trade sideways, but fucking theta gang, man. "
"12488920","12491120"," But other than that, like put enough time on them."
"12491200","12491840"," They're fucking beautiful."
"12494600","12495940"," They are fucking beautiful. "
"12501360","12504660"," I put them out to July."
"12504880","12505180"," It was free."
"12505780","12508600"," Yeah, if you find the right strikes, man, they're gorgeous. "
"12515240","12516940"," They're absolutely gorgeous trades."
"12517860","12523560"," Like they're fucking like, man, they're like one of the best fucking trades out there, period."
"12524680","12527100"," Especially on like major support or resistance. "
"12528500","12530880"," Just like every time you're up there and down there you go."
"12531040","12532880"," Yeah, it's time to start thinking about these things."
"12534660","12540450"," Yeah, I usually get a credit on mine. "
"12540650","12541350"," I usually get a credit."
"12543990","12545590"," I usually get a credit in the beginning."
"12546530","12547290"," But freeze fine too. "
"12556080","12557320"," He knew it was good at that too."
"12557480","12560100"," His volatility was always great at that Scott."
"12560580","12561880"," Do you guys know Scott always?"
"12563580","12566100"," He's always like, Scott, he's calling me up all the time. "
"12566200","12568000"," He's like, dude, I just got paid to make this trade."
"12568600","12570540"," He's like, this trade, I got this for free."
"12570880","12572240"," He's like, this trade, they owed me money. "
"12573180","12574540"," I'm like, that's a good trade, isn't it?"
"12574740","12577680"," And then of course, he's always looking for interest on the trade."
"12579020","12581840"," So he's like, I already know there's a bunch of motherfuckers in this trade."
"12581840","12587360"," So when he structures his spreads like that, he's like, there's a bunch of people on this leg and"
"12587360","12590160"," then this leg and on this leg and they just pay me $2. "
"12599430","12603110"," Yeah, I can't, I'm not going to discuss the structuring of them right now."
"12603390","12604690"," We should do that on a Sunday though."
"12605370","12605990"," How about this?"
"12606130","12610910"," Remind me on a Sunday and we'll go through how to build them. "
"12611110","12613370"," But you can find option builder sites."
"12614230","12616250"," There's like a fucking, there's like a third dime a dozen."
"12616250","12622110"," And you can go, what you do is you scroll through and you change out the strikes. "
"12622730","12623750"," Find out what the payouts are."
"12624170","12628450"," And you're also looking at options chain to see if there's a high interest on those strikes."
"12629470","12631650"," And you want to also remember zeros and fives. "
"12632170","12634690"," So we're surely expecting results from the five year note."
"12634870","12638010"," So the treasury is when issued is due at the top of the hour."
"12638630","12641650"," And then you have to consider the time and then you have to consider your thesis. "
"12643730","12644090"," Right."
"12644370","12646010"," So the downside or upside thesis."
"12647190","12649810"," And then if we go here and there, what's the target?"
"12650630","12653410"," Am I in the money or am I still outside of the money?"
"12658220","12659100"," No, no, no, no. "
"12659480","12660920"," So put back spread, right?"
"12662420","12665200"," So let's show, I'll show you to put, I'm going to, like simply, I'm going to, I'm going to simply,"
"12665380","12667700"," I'm going to show to put spread, put back spread does for here."
"12668220","12669140"," It's like right here, right?"
"12671140","12676800"," If we trade, let's say I put back spread costs you a dollar and you didn't get any money."
"12676900","12677440"," It's like flat. "
"12678440","12679140"," There's a dollar."
"12679880","12680620"," If we go up."
"12682860","12687020"," If we go up and trade four, four, 30, 420 and then 430 and like a month or two. "
"12687740","12692520"," If the move was higher, you're going to make like five, 10% that trade."
"12693780","12699560"," If we blast down and we start hitting that 360, you're going to print like three to 500% somewhere"
"12699560","12699920"," in there."
"12700860","12701580"," So it does. "
"12701820","12704220"," So if you're a bear, if you're like a bearish thesis to the downside."
"12704320","12705960"," It's sponsored by to the tick."

"12720420","12722820"," If you're right, you're fucking print tons of money. "
"12724820","12726860"," So you're like, I'm going to bearish thesis here."
"12728540","12729680"," If you're right, you make bank."
"12729920","12732080"," If you don't, if you're not right, we go up and start cranking. "
"12732400","12734980"," If you put enough time on them, we eventually crank up or roll over."
"12735360","12738820"," You're either going to get still pick a bank or make your 10%."
"12738820","12742700"," They suck on theta gang. "

"14574670","14578470"," Monday through Friday, all market hours and days, we should never be down."
"14578650","14579490"," I'd also got fiber."

"14794830","14796790"," They're now only worth 55 cents."
"14797050","14799050"," They should serve all the calls."
"14799890","14800730"," They're worthless. "
"14802390","14804390"," This is lopsided to the put side."
"14804730","14806810"," When we see this in these meetings, we tend to rip."
"14808050","14813050"," Not financial advice, but these puts, they're okay. "
"14813050","14816430"," They're like 55 cents, 96 cents."
"14818470","14822970"," They don't have the big feel like we're going to the fucking moon."
"14824170","14825190"," It should peter out. "
"14835330","14836470"," No way where you roam."
"14837390","14837730"," That sucks."
"14840790","14841470"," Yikes. "
"14863920","14867260"," So, in 10 minutes time now, we do expect to hear comments from ECB's Lagarde."

"14891660","14894160"," Getting another squeeze into the 140 hour right now."
"14896320","14900980"," We're watching the VIX retest once again, the weekly trigger."
"14901300","14905700"," The hourly trigger is moving up to the weekly trigger, though, on the VIX. "
"14911280","14917180"," Yeah, where we roam, you know, we had an animal die in our family this week, and we still haven't."
"14917260","14919820"," It's been like that would be a faster process."
"14920140","14922220"," It's turning into a longer process than we expected. "
"14922960","14924820"," We get some of that shit coming our way to."

"15102950","15105470"," Like fucking spy wants to fuck."
"15108770","15110150"," Just under five minutes time. "
"15110310","15114630"," Now we do expect to hear comments from ECB's Lagarde, who speaks at the celebration to mark the"

"15151550","15153230"," Oh, yeah. "
"15155170","15157650"," Tell me all about your bearishness out there."

"15195710","15196990"," Kill the Vicks, baby. "

"15261270","15263450"," We do have a bull plane on the one minute chart. "
"15263450","15265910"," But you know, it's still a fucking dangerous."
"15266010","15270570"," So your five minute charts are way better than running a one minute chart."
"15270690","15273870"," If you're really a new trader, you have no business trading a one minute chart. "
"15274550","15281250"," Oh, baby."

"15305670","15306330"," Just to repeat that. "
"15306470","15307590"," That's what I was saying."
"15307750","15308910"," I don't like that."
"15309110","15311330"," We have MBS on the Fed's balance sheet. "
"15311670","15313750"," Hopefully at some point can run those off."
"15318170","15321170"," Oh, all those puts are now down to 40 cents."
"15322230","15324890"," They only have like another 30 cents to go. "
"15325070","15326130"," 20 cents to go."

"15371300","15377560"," Business of buying MBS says there are good yield curving versions and that may be what we have now."
"15382860","15387600"," So if that's what he's giving it on for questions off the giving his speech. "
"15391180","15394400"," Oh, look at that fucking so we're going to find out here."
"15395640","15400060"," So as we trade up here, right, we're going to find out if we reject the Staley trigger."
"15401440","15403960"," And roll down to the depths of hell in the weekly. "

"15438140","15439340"," Get reclaimed."
"15440660","15444260"," If the daily trigger gets reclaimed, watch the fuck out. "
"15447520","15449400"," You got the hourly above it."
"15449840","15454260"," And then you've got a four trigger bull cluster that'll form."
"15456420","15462240"," So watch your asses up there bears sell side bears like get down to the depths of hell. "
"15462240","15472030"," Is that a little green bar right here?"

"15743900","15744560"," They'll be you get it, right?"
"15745420","15749280"," And then like they fucking murder him right into their earnings knowing they're going to have great"
"15749280","15749520"," earnings. "
"15749520","15752200"," Even on an upbeat trend into it, they'll like murder it."
"15752440","15755440"," So the minutes later in the day for the from the federal reserves."
"15755700","15761620"," FOMC meeting in May are expected to reveal concern over credit conditions, which may prompt the US"
"15761620","15764260"," central bank to pause interest rate hikes in June. "
"15764880","15770500"," Policymakers have been walking a fine line trying not to tip the economy into a recession with its"
"15770500","15773160"," rate hikes in attempts to clamp back inflation."
"15773940","15781340"," But if the US debt deal contains deep, deep spending cuts, or there is a default economist projects"
"15781340","15782780"," a US recession regardless."
"15784640","15785940"," Yeah, that's a fair point. "
"15787180","15790200"," That's the same shit as like the shit inside of these minutes."
"15790200","15793420"," Like what's like hidden in that too?"
"15793560","15794060"," I agree with that."
"15795880","15800400"," What's hidden inside like like the hidden stuff like we're going to pause. "
"15800660","15801100"," Why though?"
"15802040","15803740"," Like the why is the thing that's got me."
"15803740","15809720"," It's like that little like curveball, 10%, 5%, 0.5% for tail risk."
"15815260","15819620"," Then we can say in the closest analog right now would be what they did to MSFT. "
"15820240","15822600"," It dropped below 275 on earnings day."
"15823560","15825260"," And then was 303 by open, right?"
"15826180","15829760"," So you get like a second whammy on it like it took the trade all the way up and then"
"15829760","15831800"," Microsoft cut it all loose."
"15832860","15835840"," Dealers like we can't have it go in this high or this this point. "
"15837300","15839020"," And then fucking day the earnings."
"15839020","15842800"," They know it's stellar and they ripped that rip faces off again on it, right?"
"15844220","15845920"," You're like Costco out there."
"15846700","15847560"," Costco, right?"
"15847740","15849540"," You got an NVDA out there. "
"15853100","15853960"," Oh, yeah, dude."
"15854200","15855700"," No proxy were to help with the GDP."
"15856600","15858400"," All right, dude, I stand by that statement. "
"15858980","15860240"," I fucking stand by that statement."
"15860740","15862820"," I guarantee the moment the recession is over."
"15863920","15866840"," Relations improve between Russia, the U.S. and China. "
"15866900","15868120"," Garin fucking teed."
"15868800","15870320"," It's like wag the dog shit."
"15876940","15878020"," Garin teed on that. "
"15879000","15879960"," Garin teed."
"15895070","15897010"," You're like so like an NVDA."
"15897130","15901930"," I'm like, I'm like, man, if we get an NVDA like 240 or something. "
"15902990","15904950"," And then it just rips fucking faces off again."
"15905650","15906150"," It'd be great."
"15906470","15907630"," I don't think we get that low, but. "
"15912540","15915420"," That's the, that's the thing that pisses me off by the, we all know that."
"15916540","15920520"," We, like, we, so in the background, we all know two things."
"15921900","15925280"," We know that the statement that they have to price in AI is bullshit. "
"15927380","15930020"," We know the real truth is they're going to run the fuck up."
"15935320","15936600"," We know it'll come back down."
"15936780","15938360"," So yeah, like two, uh, two 88. "
"15940460","15941940"," An NVDA would be nice."
"15946520","15949900"," And the crazy part about NVDA is this is the crazy part."
"15950060","15952720"," This is why I say that make these statements about that about that shit. "
"15952900","15954180"," Like get six minutes left."
"15955100","15959720"," Like NVDA could go all the way down to 240 fucking dollars and still being a bull trend up."
"15960160","15961400"," Land some fucked up shit. "
"15962840","15967300"," And that speaks to like, uh, when they run, like when they were, when they ran our camp, our camp,"
"15967540","15967900"," it's like."
"15967900","15969800"," Yeah, it's done, but it wasn't."
"15969920","15972800"," It was like nine months later, a year later. "
"15973960","15977200"," Like when does that actual AI trade end?"
"15977420","15979340"," Is it three months, six months?"
"15981880","15983080"," Is it nine months?"
"15986020","15992920"," Will we be in, uh, like January will come around and you'll see CNBC saying there's lots of juice"
"15992920","15993520"," left in AI."

"16237590","16239990"," All that sweet, sweet ball, baby."
"16265180","16270280"," Look at that pin on the weekly right there, just like pinned on 20 to wait."
"16277720","16278660"," Ten seconds. "
"16282540","16286280"," Strap in, buckle in, boys and girls."
"16291610","16297510"," Third minute says some participants noted concerns the federal debt limit may not be raised in a"
"16297510","16298670"," timely manner threatening."
"16298850","16299330"," Whoa. "
"16299530","16302430"," Financial system disruption and tighter financial credits."
"16302950","16307190"," Participants agreed that inflation was unacceptably high and declining slower than they had"
"16307190","16307610"," expected."
"16308270","16311470"," Participants judged the banking sector stresses would likely wait. "
"16312390","16318870"," But to an uncertain extent, many participants focused on the need to retain optionality after the"
"16318870","16324070"," main meeting and participants at the Fed's May to second to third meeting generally agreed the"
"16324070","16325950"," extent to which further interest rate hikes."
"16326290","16328170"," Maybe appropriate had become less certain."
"16328870","16332270"," Many participants focused on the need to retain optionality after the meeting. "
"16333010","16338670"," Several participants said if the economy evolved along lines of their outlooks, further policy"
"16338670","16340110"," firming may not be needed."
"16340650","16346350"," Some participants stressed it was crucial that policy statement not signaled the likelihood of rate"
"16346350","16348750"," cuts this year or rule out further hikes."
"16349670","16354910"," Some participants commented that additional policy firming would likely be warranted at future"
"16354910","16359570"," meetings and several participants said if the economy evolved along the lines of their outlooks"
"16359570","16360030"," just repeat. "
"16360930","16367250"," So not too much difference here at this point."
"16367390","16373190"," I'll try to get the actual session starting later this year, followed by a modestly paced recovery."
"16374230","16374910"," Nice. "
"16378420","16382440"," Many participants focus on need to retain optionality after the meeting."
"16383099","16384720"," Key point there."
"16384720","16390800"," So the yields on the 10 year US Treasury notes slipped after the FMC meeting last up to spot one"
"16390800","16394240"," or two spot 10, the basis points at three spots, 79%. "
"16395020","16401020"," So generally what was said by Jerome Powell in the last rate hike decision, not too many"
"16401020","16401880"," differences there."
"16402580","16408660"," Nothing extremely hawkish, nothing, a little bit of still a little bit of pullback on the potential"
"16408660","16409580"," for a pause."
"16409580","16415020"," Wait and see up one spot, six places points last at three spot, nine, six, eight percent. "
"16416099","16418619"," See if this ball kicks off and gets off the market."
"16418619","16419980"," Now the event is over."
"16423240","16424919"," Some participants noted concerns. "
"16425380","16426599"," I'll read a few things to you."
"16430020","16434439"," Some participants noted concerns that the federal debt limit may not be raised in a timely manner,"
"16434480","16438200"," threatening significant financial system disruptions, tighter financial conditions."
"16438930","16444960"," We also have participants agreed that inflation was then acceptably high in our declining declining"
"16444960","16451779"," slower than had been expected participants judged that the banking sector stress would likely weigh"
"16451779","16459140"," on economic activity, but to not an uncertain extent made many participants on need to retain"
"16459140","16462060"," optionality after the May meeting. "
"16462540","16469140"," And that's in that's in that's in the point of do we pause or do we add rates in future"
"16469140","16469740"," meetings."
"16470560","16474740"," Participants generally agreed that the extent to which further interest rate hikes may be"

"16477060","16483160"," Several participants said if the economy evolved long lines of their outlooks further policy"
"16483160","16485960"," firming might not be needed, not be needed. "
"16486680","16493540"," Fed staff continue to forecast mild recession starting later this year, followed by a modestly"
"16493540","16494700"," paced recovery."
"16495380","16496980"," Well, that's a key point right there."
"16497140","16497180"," Right. "
"16497320","16505279"," So you get the I'm I'm taking that as a soft landing ish, but like a China, trying to make"
"16505279","16510980"," a mild recession meeting minutes on the feed for those interested to full statement is there."
"16512099","16514580"," So you'd be looking for dips to buy."
"16515700","16520320"," If we get any dips to 360, if we get any dips to 3200, you'll be looking to buy those"
"16520320","16522320"," next rises after the Fed minutes. "
"16522320","16527720"," Lost up is there a spot three at one nine percent on the day and they're anticipating some form of"
"16527720","16529380"," a recovery the following year."
"16529560","16530500"," Now, do I believe all that?"
"16530759","16531460"," I don't know."
"16532380","16537919"," Fed minutes, some participants stressed it was crucial that policy that the statement not signal"
"16537919","16541960"," the likelihood of rate cuts this year or rule out further hikes. "
"16541960","16543300"," That's a key point right there."
"16544119","16550860"," Some participants stressed it was crucial that part of the policy that the statement not signal to"
"16550860","16551060"," you."
"16551119","16556160"," They don't want you to think that there is any likelihood of rate cuts this year or rule out"
"16556160","16557520"," further hikes. "
"16558800","16561140"," Market is reacting to the downside right now."
"16561220","16564860"," We'll see if we get a bounce or if they trade this sideways into the close."
"16567680","16572000"," I've got the actual minutes right here in front of me and I'm going to try to read through this"
"16572000","16572700"," stuff right now. "
"16574820","16577140"," So kind of a nothing burger at this point, right?"
"16577400","16579200"," Nothing really that we didn't already know."
"16580500","16585820"," No real like really bad news, no good news, no like, hey, we're getting a pause."
"16586380","16588279"," They had some discussion of a pause. "
"16589400","16592680"," That was that was reinforced, I guess, right?"
"16593360","16596040"," And then they don't want you to think that we're getting a pause."
"16598919","16602200"," They don't want they want you to think that there's more coming."
"16602200","16603800"," So be aware of that threat. "
"16608470","16610050"," So I'm going to stick with my thing here."
"16610090","16614189"," I think that we get 25 BPS or even none for the summer."
"16615830","16616990"," I think it's wait or see. "
"16617130","16619330"," I don't think you're getting 50 BPS in the June meeting."
"16622369","16626610"," But I do think you know what I do think though, if you get a pause in June or 25"
"16626610","16630110"," BPS and if you get 25 or for a pause in June."
"16631090","16635230"," I think if nothing happens this summer, they're going to put a fucking hammer on us. "
"16636230","16639570"," Like we were all into September or some shit and they're going to be like, bam."
"16648680","16650919"," This dream is sponsored by to the tick."
"16651220","16656820"," So you're seeing a reprising of options right now, no real movements in the spy to the upper"
"16656820","16657160"," downside. "
"16658080","16660439"," You're seeing I'm watching the chain right now."
"16660480","16661939"," They're just kind of bleeding it all off."
"16663400","16668240"," We'll see which way this resolves or if they trade this sideways into the bell today. "
"16669119","16670720"," Two PM here."
"16671560","16674340"," Let me know in the chat if you think we actually go up or down."
"16676000","16678759"," Where do they trade this shit sideways into Friday?"
"16678759","16680380"," You also got PCE. "
"16680919","16686320"," The last real volatility of the week, the Fed said that they were going to rely upon that for their"
"16686320","16687320"," June rate decision."
"16687980","16693540"," So you're going to be wanting to pay attention to that into the into the Friday session and keeping"
"16693540","16695400"," keeping aware of that and how that impacts."
"16695400","16703080"," If we get 25 BPS 50 BPS, you'll also want to pair that with the debt ceiling talks. "
"16703500","16707320"," If the debt ceiling solved all that kind of shit all wrapped into one with PCE."
"16707980","16712619"," I should give the market some clear direction heading into the month of June."
"16718570","16720070"," Yeah, I like that trade too. "
"16720210","16720890"," I like that sideways."
"16721310","16726029"," I like the the trade that I'm on right now is like we hit for 30."
"16726029","16728849"," First week of June, maybe first second. "
"16729950","16733390"," And then we'll be come down here and then we go up there to get to 430."
"16733930","16736669"," They like roll the market down and just trade it sideways and down."
"16737330","16738410"," Something like that. "
"16746310","16751130"," Market merchant chiming in saying T and X is trending lower means bond market is not buying the"
"16751130","16752009"," future rate hikes."
"16752790","16755990"," Yeah, I think I was wondering if they would say anything."
"16755990","16760369"," I got the I got it open in the background to see what their fairs are specific fairs. "
"16761029","16767110"," I have this like in the back of my mind, I'm like, they're probably seeing shit coming down the"
"16767110","16768849"," road that they probably are."
"16769869","16776029"," They probably know that like it's like, it's like, I mean, I know you want to do this, but you"
"16776029","16777950"," saw them support regional banks."
"16779310","16783090"," So I know you want to be like 50 BPS and no debt ceiling. "
"16783790","16789430"," But if they anticipate or at any point, if that's not resolved and there's no fucking way you're"
"16789430","16790510"," getting 50 BPS."
"16791170","16793490"," And no solution to the debt ceiling."
"16794210","16796730"," In June, you're not getting like. "
"16797450","16802630"," Spy at 30 earths SPX at 3600 and then Jerome comes out and he's like."
"16803290","16804870"," And fuck you again."
"16806190","16809390"," Here's a 50 BPS lick my balls. "
"16810810","16812390"," I don't think you're getting that."
"16812670","16813910"," Maybe I don't think you are."
"16815590","16818610"," Oh, and we got commercial real estate on fire over here. "
"16819090","16820950"," We're going to burn it all down at once."
"16821790","16824690"," Maybe I guess some people probably think that, but I don't."
"16825530","16829370"," I think they're going to try to think they're going to try to fuck everybody along the way and"
"16829370","16832590"," they're going to ride this shit sideways for like two years. "
"16833770","16838690"," Originally, I thought it would be like end of this year, but that fucking regional bank shit, man."
"16839270","16841790"," That fucked over a lot of participants."
"16846330","16849430"," I expect them to do the same man for the next year or two. "
"16850330","16853830"," Drag this shit out for like two more years going to suck our eyes are going to bleed."
"16858610","16865410"," So nothing burger so far on the fed the fed stop reading through this right now."
"16865410","16867830"," And we got to read closer here. "
"16867830","16869130"," So I'll probably read this tonight."
"16869710","16870790"," You guys read this stuff."
"16870870","16872550"," Am I the only person that reads this shit?"
"16874830","16877910"," Like I read all this stuff like top to bottom and scour it. "
"16877970","16881990"," And then I always hear people commenting on it and I'm like, they're just reading what they were"
"16881990","16882950"," fed and what they were told."
"16883090","16884110"," They didn't actually read the paper."
"16886070","16887910"," So I'll read that for myself later on. "
"16888610","16889890"," Big nothing burger today."

"17162650","17165790"," I was like a bright eyed bushy tail bull."
"17166130","17167710"," I guess I would have called myself a bull. "
"17169910","17173070"," But then I started thinking like a main street or I was like."
