"117760","117980"," Okay."
"119780","126900"," So yeah, last yesterday at the close we supposedly had a south side but we had some forced buying"
"126900","127780"," in the close yesterday. "
"128400","130960"," And so you'll see that pullback in the following day."
"132660","134300"," So markets look fine to me."
"134460","135700"," I don't know why everybody's in a panic. "
"135960","138340"," You guys want to know tell me why everybody's panic in this morning."

"176620","177260"," Mourn Chas."
"177780","179760"," We'll check on IWM to you."
"179760","183820"," I don't just say you guys know I don't have some some good morning Steve. "
"185740","186620"," More than endless."
"187120","189620"," So we've got some so a couple things."
"191640","194100"," Tesla everybody's got in for 1000 right off the belt. "
"194100","194920"," Just so you guys know."
"195160","195220"," Okay."
"196040","200080"," You can take a look right here heading to nine thirty that we've got buyers below at nine fifty"
"200080","200700"," nine thirty. "
"204740","206880"," So there should be a buy in here."
"207120","209380"," We should tag nine fifty and go straight up."
"209840","212000"," You can see that the sellers are at one thousand. "
"214640","217000"," We have more buyers stepping in at nine forty."
"219380","220760"," Right off the bell here too."
"220920","221900"," So you've got some power here. "
"225540","230340"," Let me take a look at some other stuff as we open and just so you guys know IWM is"
"230340","230680"," looking at nine fifty."
"230680","232460"," I'm looking looking rock this morning."
"232640","236740"," I want to see what's up with the IWM on another computer screen here. "
"240400","242980"," Right now you're seeing you can see this right here."
"243120","244560"," The shorts are coming in hard and heavy."
"245080","246180"," Some sellers are coming in above. "
"247000","253420"," That is some angry angry bears that those sellers were not there yesterday."
"257399","259600"," Angry bears coming in right off the bow."
"260899","262280"," Look at Apple. "
"262720","265660"," Apple is going to the moon right now."
"266160","267120"," Yee-haw Apple."
"270740","273060"," This is blowing up some shorts this morning. "
"273620","275540"," I was wondering why I was on a tizzy this morning."
"276060","279640"," I almost posted like what's everybody in a what's every panic about."
"280260","284280"," What I panicked this morning is shorts and bears getting wrecked. "
"289540","291120"," That's the only panic this morning."
"294780","296580"," No offense to bears out there."
"296640","297340"," I love you guys too. "
"297440","300320"," But yeah, you can see this by right off the bell."
"300540","303680"," I think this is the spy right here."
"306700","311080"," Why am I getting this goofiness that Tesla buyers stepping in right off the bell at nine fifty"
"311080","311540"," seven. "
"312220","316920"," You saw that wave of buyers come right in down there at nine fifty five."
"316920","317760"," They stepped in."
"317940","320640"," You'll also see at nine fifty nine forty. "
"322320","323620"," Lots of buyers below."
"324620","326860"," And everyone knows that the cell is at one thousand."
"328040","333060"," You've got some at nine eighty but the real resistance is above. "
"333480","334780"," No one's going to be waiting for this either."
"335200","336640"," This is going to move this morning."
"336820","337440"," I guarantee it. "
"340180","341520"," Tasa will move today."
"342840","344220"," Mark my words on this one."
"348240","349020"," Hang tight here. "
"349080","350760"," I'm going to get a couple of things you got to do."
"351820","353080"," Yeah, Tesla spy."
"356980","358480"," Yeah, zero panic this morning. "
"358660","362220"," I don't know what is going on with the bears this morning."
"362420","363140"," They're just in a panic."
"363580","365260"," They were expecting that doom and gloom. "
"366320","368520"," My all my eyes are on I don't have you on this morning too."
"370160","372520"," Anything down here for me is a buy on IWM."
"372520","377160"," And this looks like short covering on IWM for me. "
"377920","378800"," Look at NDX."
"382140","382900"," This too."
"383580","384460"," Yeah, this is all normal. "
"385080","390160"," So like if you watch last night's video, you will see where the buy was this morning on NDX."
"390360","391460"," We're tapping there right now."
"392460","395480"," I don't think it's looking a little bit weak, but it shouldn't be. "
"396180","397620"," I don't think it should crank today."
"397620","401180"," And you can see Tasa coming right out the gate."
"401500","402600"," It's just blasting off. "
"402640","407060"," It's at 972.76. You can see where we are right now."
"407080","411200"," We're going to encounter at 980 some sellers, but that cell wall is very thin."
"411360","411500"," Okay. "
"412940","418080"," You still have lots of strength down below at 949.50. And the moment we break through that."
"418200","419860"," Let's say you've just bought this bell right here."
"419860","421580"," You buy that bell that drop in the bell. "
"421820","424100"," You're going to briefly sell out at that 980."
"424100","425300"," Take some profit."
"425300","430940"," Let the banks work through that grinding through that minor resistance at 980. "
"431460","433580"," And then it'll blast off to 1000 door fail."
"434160","435580"," We'll see right now if that happens."
"441330","443070"," I'm going to go back and check out you guys. "
"447480","448220"," Morning, everybody."
"448440","449040"," Morning, T-Crown."
"449320","449420"," Joe. "
"449580","450020"," Good morning."
"451720","452160"," Okay."
"452260","452840"," Tesla nine. "
"453100","453180"," Fiddy."
"454100","455660"," We loaded some Tesla leaps yesterday."
"456100","456360"," Hell yeah. "
"456620","457360"," Hell yeah, everybody."
"458080","458600"," Good morning, everybody."
"458900","460120"," Hope you're just joining us right now. "
"460880","462460"," This is a book map live stream."
"462580","464940"," This shows you live where the buyers are."
"465300","468380"," This also shows you where the sellers are. "
"468560","473280"," You can see that there are nice, large green balls up here at 974."
"473940","475560"," These are consuming the sellers."
"475900","477060"," I'll show you guys right now. "
"477640","479300"," We'll take a look and see."
"481160","483640"," We do have slightly more sellers right now at this moment."
"483800","484660"," So you might see a little bit of grind. "
"485180","488400"," We've got 180,000 buyers, 338,000 sellers."
"488400","489840"," These are all shorts."
"490180","490400"," Oh, man. "
"490520","492160"," These are these are banks with shorts."
"492700","494160"," I'll tell you exactly with who this is."
"494460","496660"," These are banks with shorts and they own stock. "
"497120","504260"," So what they'll do is actively shorten a stock and I'll actually sell position to create weakness"
"504260","506940"," so that my shorts don't get wrecked."
"508280","510800"," This isn't just normal like Joe in the street."
"511559","512380"," Jim Bob on the street. "
"513659","517679"," This is, you know, this is real gangster shit, I guess."
"520740","522679"," Everyone knows it's going to a thousand today."
"524580","525720"," So hold on one second. "
"526180","527620"," One more look at something else here."
"530880","532240"," Guarantee tussles hot today."
"532760","540460"," I'm looking at here. "
"545180","546880"," Oh, you know what I'm doing right here?"
"548060","549360"," I am on the wrong."
"551480","558940"," You got more buyers stepping in."
"558940","565060"," If you check the bottom right hand side of my screen on CVD buyers and CVD sellers, you got a"
"565060","566660"," lot of buyers stepping up right now. "
"566660","567480"," It was much lower."
"568080","569520"," It was at like two or 170."
"570060","572540"," So you're seeing some interest in Tesla at the open this morning. "
"573280","574000"," We just second here."
"574080","575200"," We had to set some stuff up."
"577940","589290"," And yeah,"
"589290","591990"," the delay right now is not so bad. "
"592570","597670"," It delays only like 30 seconds, maybe a minute at most."
"597670","603310"," So you guys are you guys are getting close to a pretty pretty live live feed."
"608010","611410"," I'll do some market commentary for you here in just a moment. "
"611790","613970"," I just got to set up some charts and my."
"614630","615730"," Open up my brokerage."
"615750","618690"," Look at my things bleeding or not. "
"634220","636360"," Get nice volume today on Tesla."
"675080","677080"," Get some Tesla gang coming in here."
"677620","681180"," They're probably going to be logging in here to check this out in just a minute. "
"684760","689440"," Maybe we'll get some Tesla Q types in here to this morning so they can see where to sell, right?"
"689760","693440"," You know that's how you know some Tesla Q will jump in this morning."
"696960","699020"," Looks like I got a lot of Tesla gang."
"699020","701200"," Well, I joined the stream this morning. "
"701360","702960"," If you're Tesla gang, welcome."
"704440","706440"," If you're Tesla Q, you're welcome."
"706760","710000"," Welcome to you this morning to get nothing bad to say any guys. "
"712580","717720"," I don't mind test the queue if they're reasonable logical."
"719080","722820"," Same goes for Tesla gang, you know, just rational logical investors."
"722820","723120"," Traders. "
"725620","726460"," I like them all."
"728640","729360"," All right."
"730160","731240"," Let's take a look here. "
"737160","739560"," I like people when they when they like."
"739760","740260"," Hold on."
"740620","741180"," Take a look at this. "
"741540","742200"," Oh, yeah."
"743760","744620"," That's pretty good."
"744700","745160"," Do it better. "
"745580","746860"," We're getting a bit in the market."
"746860","748060"," I can tell in my calls."
"748480","749140"," So I've been on. "
"749380","753500"," I've owned some calls since that rock rock rock bottom and it shows."
"754880","757820"," In the premium that the market has a bed."
"762170","763230"," Markets looking good. "
"764550","768470"," Sometimes you can see the market still go down and you'll your calls will be green."
"769090","771390"," Or when we're switching."
"772490","773570"," Yeah, I'm making money. "
"774510","775550"," Right on right on."
"776130","776830"," I like it."
"781680","784420"," Yeah, we're so so you guys know, right?"
"784640","786400"," This when you're looking at this right now, right?"
"786400","788260"," We're at one, we're at nine, seven, eight right now. "
"788560","791140"," We are just grinding through sellers right now."
"791640","792800"," You guys can see this, right?"
"793180","797340"," This is a minor resistance and we're, we're going to move our way up to 1000."
"797680","799160"," 100% or at least right now. "
"799320","802840"," Unless we see a sea of liquidity buyers disappear here."
"803280","807720"," If you see a big swoop down and I want to point you out to a couple of the things."
"808300","810200"," You'll see this nice thin blue line down here. "
"811060","813280"," This nice thin blue line down here."
"813280","816180"," These are where you call this mark money down here."
"816680","819000"," And they swooped up this morning right off the bell. "
"819260","822740"," You saw them as we, as we dipped down in the past here."
"823220","825620"," We can show you some of this."
"826100","829280"," You could see that earlier, they swooped in. "
"829400","833720"," You can see these bars have disappeared now, but earlier you saw right at that nine 50 mark."
"833900","834620"," They swooped right in."
"834900","835680"," We have interest. "
"836040","840920"," We have buyers right now interested in joining in and trading Tesla today."
"841940","846780"," You can see that we have a little bit of higher concentration right now of some sellers coming in"
"846780","847640"," at the 980 mark."
"848040","849900"," But right here, this is what you're looking for. "
"850220","853240"," You want to know where the top is on Tesla for today."
"853360","855240"," And right now it's at a thousand bucks and out of 980."
"857620","862400"," More people that know that when you start showing more people at that, we can go up to 1000. "
"863040","865140"," They'll start to, to trade with more confidence."
"865140","871700"," And you'll actually see these blue lines down here are starting to grow stronger and stronger as"
"871700","873320"," the morning wears on."
"878520","879840"," Spy getting in gear now. "
"880160","881300"," Yeah, you should be seeing that."
"881660","882980"," I don't mind Tesla."
"883240","884260"," You know what it is?"
"884420","885220"," I don't mind Tesla. "
"885460","889620"," You get their constructive and the same thing goes for Tesla gang."
"889860","894360"," I don't want to be buying Tesla when it's at an absolute top for the next month or so."
"894600","896160"," And I don't like pushing people to do that either. "
"896160","903060"," I like, I like to push people to buy Tesla when it's low and own it for that time frame"
"903060","904660"," when it's a good price for being low."
"905320","907040"," But you know, like Kathy Wood, she takes profit."
"907560","908640"," Tesla investors take profit. "
"909720","910740"," The good ones buy low."
"911640","916080"," They take some profit off the table when it goes to stupid highs because that is Tesla sometimes."
"916400","919780"," Sometimes Tesla goes too high too fast in my view. "
"920460","921380"," Not all of you believe that."
"921380","923760"," And also me believe you buy every level."
"923900","924360"," I get that. "
"924600","927080"," And that's partially why we're going up this morning."
"927880","929760"," We've looked at Tesla this whole past week."
"930220","933540"," And no matter what, there's always, there are always buyers on Tesla. "
"934240","936340"," Right down at that nine hundred eight ninety mark."
"936740","938620"," You just saw people line up."
"938900","939380"," People love it. "
"939520","940160"," People love the stock."
"941000","943780"," We're, you know, a spot gamma also put out a video."
"944600","948380"," I was talking to some guys in a spot gamma discord and they were asking about it the day. "
"948380","949500"," And then yesterday."
"951700","952700"," What's the name is?"
"952880","955620"," That's Sam is, is, is pronounced differently."
"955840","957580"," It's like chain or something or chem. "
"959240","962980"," And he was, he made a short video talking about the Christmas rally."
"963900","969040"," And it wouldn't be complete having some sort of Christmas rally without seeing Tesla."
"970260","971160"," Pull something out of its hat. "
"971340","974180"," You know, you've got Elon saying you wrapped up a selling."
"975000","977620"," The news point, then you just have it be in the holidays."
"978240","983640"," Some people want to see their favorite stocks move up and they're willing to enter the fray. "
"984120","987580"," So I think that's, that was the implication behind the spot gamma video."
"987780","989300"," Did you guys all watch that spot gamma video?"
"990020","992800"," That came out yesterday and day or something."
"993440","993920"," Good morning, everybody. "
"994620","994940"," More Brad."
"995160","995520"," More than Henry."
"998900","1000300"," Thank you for the heads up there. "
"1000300","1003360"," Henry and 7,000 open interest at 1000 calls for Tesla."
"1003980","1004200"," Yeah."
"1004420","1005380"," Yeah, you start seeing. "
"1006080","1007460"," We didn't have that before."
"1007680","1011420"," You start seeing one day, three days, zero day."
"1011600","1016380"," It starts seeing like weeklies on Tesla to 1000 and above. "
"1016680","1019220"," If you were to buy weekly is that like one or 1100."
"1020640","1021160"," 1050."
"1021920","1022920"," Start seeing interest there. "
"1023200","1024839"," You're going to start seeing us crank and much higher."
"1026220","1028660"," And, you know, the traders come out for this stuff."
"1034000","1039470"," Yeah, good morning, everybody. "
"1040470","1042470"," Got a hundred native you out there watching right now."
"1042609","1044030"," Okay, so what we're going to do is this."
"1044190","1046609"," We're going to talk about Tesla here and then we're going to. "
"1047130","1051190"," Also, if you guys want to shout out at some point, you're what you think is going to."
"1051750","1052810"," Go boom today."
"1053950","1057590"," If you think there are any tech, any tickers out there that are have a low hedge wall. "
"1058650","1059310"," Thank you."
"1059570","1062410"," I want you guys to realize that right now coming into end of year, you've got."
"1063350","1068790"," A lot of individual stock hedge walls coming off. "
"1069250","1073210"," And I've got us some software when I do some screenshots on later."
"1074310","1077550"," After this live stream ends, I'm going to be posting."
"1078890","1084530"," Some individual tickers that have major hedging rolling off between now and mid January. "
"1085330","1089990"," Talking an example would be tickers like PayPal, tickers like snap."
"1090430","1094390"," Some of them, there's a list of them that have major head walls rolling off."
"1094610","1100870"," And that would infer in the gamma, if there's call structure back there, that is farther out that"
"1100870","1102030"," they will swing higher. "
"1102750","1107370"," Once that gamma comes off, there'll be a reaction almost like a squeeze, right?"
"1107870","1108390"," A gamma squeeze."
"1109750","1114810"," And so if you guys are seeing that happening in individual tickers this morning, we can take a look"
"1114810","1119150"," at some of those tickers on book map as we move forward."
"1122270","1123570"," Fidelity has an outage. "
"1124630","1125370"," Good morning."
"1125470","1126070"," Good morning."
"1127210","1127650"," Mihai. "
"1127830","1128210"," Good morning."
"1130050","1130750"," Morning Brad."
"1131370","1131770"," Morning hutch. "
"1131950","1132570"," Morning bloodstunk."
"1132830","1133010"," Morning Eric."
"1133130","1134590"," I think most of you guys said I looked morning too. "
"1134690","1135110"," Good morning, Henry."
"1136130","1136730"," Thanks for that tip."
"1136850","1137490"," Tip Henry. "
"1139590","1140030"," Yes."
"1140290","1141390"," We'll show some of those tickers."
"1141390","1144470"," I did some research on a bunch of tickers last night. "
"1144870","1149010"," I'm going to post a bunch of these tickers for you today in the handle."
"1149410","1154750"," These are tickers that have stupid hedging that was put on them for November and December."
"1155510","1159970"," Not just not just index hedging, but just straight on specific tickers. "
"1160590","1165150"," And there's been none of that hedging replaced on those tickers."
"1165470","1170030"," And the moment that stuff rolls off, it should get real nasty in a good way."
"1173510","1175590"," Earnings gap up and then gap down right now. "
"1175970","1177670"," Likely Nvidia chart wise."
"1178210","1178590"," Prague."
"1179410","1179890"," Yeah. "
"1179970","1184450"," If you guys want to post or you guys type inside the inside the chat box, what tickers you want"
"1184450","1185610"," to see me hit here in a little bit."
"1186110","1187510"," And we will take a look."
"1188010","1191110"," And you can see the volume increasing on app on Tesla right now. "
"1192030","1193470"," I will make this smaller."
"1194210","1196310"," We'll wait for the volume to swoop up."
"1197610","1199110"," So you're going to be looking for. "
"1199110","1203490"," If you want to enter Tesla this morning and you haven't entered at this point, you're going to be"
"1203490","1208650"," looking in the bottom right hand side of the screen and you're going to look for a switch from more"
"1208650","1209730"," sellers to more buyers."
"1209730","1215250"," As soon as the buyers start to consume the sellers, you're going to start to see this grind and"
"1215250","1217150"," then move up that next level of 1000."
"1218330","1220350"," And one other thing for you all to know. "
"1220890","1225290"," If you were to beat the 1000 sellers today, that's clear skies above."
"1226010","1231350"," So if you saw our welcome in today at some point, you would if you start seeing major calls being"
"1231350","1234350"," made above 1000, like 1100 calls."
"1235610","1239670"," There's a fair potential of us squeezing Tesla at some point. "
"1239970","1241110"," This is a major wall though."
"1241230","1242230"," You got to understand that."
"1242490","1247690"," If you're looking at that wedge that's formed on Tesla, this is where that wall is at 1000. "
"1248130","1251470"," If you just like if you normally chart a Tesla with traditional."
"1255170","1256250"," Traditional charting methods."
"1256910","1259170"," That's why you see that big line at 1000. "
"1263360","1264160"," Yeah, NVDA."
"1264360","1265100"," I'll do them for you."
"1265760","1266160"," Q is a green. "
"1266340","1266780"," They should be."
"1267080","1271300"," If any of you guys haven't checked, jump inside my video and towards like a."
"1271640","1273360"," I think I want to say like two thirds of the way in."
"1273640","1279920"," I go through where the gamma levels are on the indexes from last night, my video from last night"
"1279920","1282160"," and you can see how tradable. "
"1282160","1284660"," And the X was off that bounce today."
"1285340","1288740"," Nasdaq and then you'll also see how tradable IWM is."
"1289040","1290520"," Spy should come down a little bit. "
"1290740","1292900"," It'll still go up into end of year, but it should."
"1293140","1297460"," It should come a little bit, but if you want to trade an index, that's probably going to make some"
"1297460","1297940"," big moves."
"1298360","1302700"," It's probably IWM probably Nasdaq because of that bounce this morning. "
"1305260","1306140"," Good morning, Michael."
"1306400","1306660"," How are you?"
"1307800","1308800"," Hope you're doing well."
"1309660","1311540"," Yeah, we'll take a peek at Nvidia right now. "
"1311540","1315120"," I will add that stream real quick."
"1330490","1336590"," Let that boot up here for a moment and then we'll switch over to the Nvidia, then the Nvidia stream"
"1336590","1338470"," will bounce back and forth."
"1342650","1343350"," Good morning. "
"1343550","1344730"," I'm having a cup of coffee."
"1344910","1346090"," Hope you all have coffee in front of you."
"1346710","1348790"," Yeah, Oracle's hot. "
"1349310","1350370"," I like the Oracle trade."
"1350570","1352270"," I meant to post an Oracle trade on Sunday."
"1353090","1354410"," Oracle's a super hot stock. "
"1354410","1356310"," T is a great stock right now."
"1356530","1358270"," INTC is a great stock right now."
"1362830","1364430"," Y'all checked the hedge wall on Amazon. "
"1365730","1368130"," Amazon had a sweet buy in earlier this week."
"1368430","1369690"," They slapped right down."
"1369990","1370790"," What does this hold?"
"1370970","1373890"," They slapped right down on that yearly trend on Amazon. "
"1375430","1376450"," I picked for 2022."
"1376850","1377810"," 2022 is 4."
"1378490","1379410"," Looking at this bad boy."
"1379590","1379770"," Yep. "
"1380010","1380150"," All right."
"1380270","1382010"," I'll look into 4 without a doubt."
"1382210","1383030"," Let me write that one down. "
"1383770","1386050"," I'll do a deep dive on 4 if you want me to."
"1386050","1388510"," And I'll post a video on it."
"1390950","1392710"," I will look at the 4 ticker. "
"1393250","1394690"," Thanks for the heads up on that one."
"1399040","1399920"," Yeah, you've got some."
"1400120","1402160"," So I want you to check this out right here, okay?"
"1402740","1406340"," You see this nice red bar right here and we're eating through those buyers. "
"1407200","1412380"," And you're seeing more buyers start to step in at 9.90. This isn't bad for the market, but you're"
"1412380","1413020"," going to see a dip."
"1413780","1415340"," And you'll see more aggressive sellers."
"1415740","1417080"," These are angry sellers up here. "
"1419080","1420340"," Always fun to watch Tesla."
"1421200","1424360"," And you're also watching a lot more interest."
"1424720","1428240"," See how this blue line here starts to become more of a white. "
"1428260","1429840"," This will turn yellow at some points."
"1430520","1433120"," And you're going to see more aggressive buyers stepping in as well."
"1433900","1438000"," And they are stepping in at 9.40. So here's my deal for you, right?"
"1438140","1439060"," And yeah, you see this. "
"1439400","1440660"," There's eaten in these buyers."
"1442140","1445160"," If you want to, if you want to trade set Tesla safely today."
"1445160","1452420"," And with less risk, you're looking for a bounce at 9.40. I don't think you're getting that bounce"
"1452420","1453880"," this morning at 9.40 though. "
"1454160","1456440"," You can see the buyers stepping up above."
"1456800","1458780"," You can see that these blue lines right here."
"1459100","1463040"," When you're leaving behind blue lines like this, this is showing that buyers are getting aggressive"
"1463040","1464180"," where we are. "
"1465540","1472040"," And you can see we're almost at 50 50 here on call our buyers versus sellers."
"1472040","1478380"," And if you see the buyers are the sellers be consumed at any moment here, you'll see a nice push"
"1478380","1478900"," up."
"1481170","1484490"," Let's take a look at NVIDIA switch over just briefly. "
"1491730","1493770"," Make sure you mark this down."
"1493770","1494150"," Okay."
"1495110","1496350"," You can see it in video. "
"1496350","1502370"," All the buyers at 270 and the wall right now is at 300 305 and 310."
"1503230","1508950"," So if you want to get into NVIDIA today, set an alert on your, you guys can click right click"
"1508950","1509990"," on any charting software."
"1509990","1516130"," We're out there and set an alert to your email and just say you do this with like 300 tickers"
"1516130","1517910"," and these tickers will come to you. "
"1518210","1524190"," So you just come to one of your favorite thing man tickers plug in 270 for today on a lot."
"1524330","1525870"," You just snap a line at 270."
"1526570","1533470"," I'd make it like 275 to just give you some advanced warning because you'll see some buyers down"
"1533470","1533990"," here. "
"1533990","1538770"," You can even set one at 280, 275, 270 have them all pop off."
"1539830","1543330"," And if you hit your price at 270, you know, you can take it along to 300."
"1544870","1546390"," That makes sense for you guys out there. "
"1546990","1548650"," That's how you day trade these tickers."
"1551150","1552350"," Set up the tickers you like."
"1553070","1554310"," Get the price that you want. "
"1555790","1562170"," Do enough of them and you will find one that's right in your buy zone."
"1562790","1563750"," Right where you want it to be."
"1564530","1565670"," So I did end video. "
"1570710","1576090"," All right, let me take a look here."
"1576430","1577890"," Miss fit you guys want misfit done."
"1586670","1589770"," And you should always be trading like that even though I like I love Tesla. "
"1591970","1597330"," You want to do the buyers are going crazy right now in Tesla."
"1598510","1599430"," Absolute crazy."
"1601650","1605930"," You guys want to be like you guys want to be setting these alerts on your on your charting"
"1605930","1606250"," software. "
"1606250","1610610"," So you'll always find one that is where you want to be a buyer."
"1610830","1611090"," Right."
"1611170","1612170"," Even if it's just day trading. "
"1612690","1617070"," If you know where the smart money is and you trade with smart money, smart money is always the"
"1617070","1618350"," banks always hedge funds."
"1618910","1621870"," They know where they want to be and they know where they want to take it to."
"1636770","1642810"," You get a massive call while at 345 on misfit and you don't have sell. "
"1642970","1643770"," You've got clear skies."
"1643970","1644210"," Basic."
"1644410","1646650"," You're grinding through some sellers right now. "
"1646750","1648950"," This actually may be a good play for some of you out there."
"1648950","1655130"," You've got looks like you had lots of buyers down at 315 and you're eating through a wall."
"1655130","1660090"," It's a very small resistance at 330 and you basically have clear skies to 340. "
"1660730","1661390"," That's a nice trade."
"1661990","1662650"," Never called that out."
"1663310","1664390"," That's a real nice trade. "
"1668630","1669330"," I like that trade."
"1676600","1678120"," And you can always pause this video."
"1678840","1682040"," Go back and this live stream you can pause it. "
"1682140","1682460"," Go back."
"1682720","1683900"," Look at misfit specifically."
"1685340","1692040"," And then refresh the page and we'll take you back to us being live. "
"1693160","1694580"," We're going to do IWM next."
"1696000","1697880"," We're going to take a moment for it to load."
"1705000","1707340"," We'll jump right back to Tesla here in just a moment. "
"1708540","1709860"," It's probably a little big."
"1710460","1711340"," We don't need to be that crazy."
"1720580","1728700"," Give IWM just a second here and I want you to see what this interpretation would be right here. "
"1729180","1731940"," We're not heading down right now on IWM."
"1732500","1735520"," We are just grinding killing killing sellers right now."
"1735880","1737480"," We know that we're good to 230. "
"1737760","1739020"," You can see it right above here."
"1739580","1742200"," This is a larger time frame so you guys can see."
"1742380","1744140"," You can see that the smart money is down at 206. "
"1745980","1748260"," IWM but you can also see here."
"1751590","1752330"," It's firm this up."
"1756490","1761730"," And you can see a nice sea of sellers and a nice big sea of buyers down below. "
"1761730","1768270"," Lots of buyers at 216, 217 and IWM is just waiting to blow up."
"1768390","1771790"," You can see that the buyers are overwhelming the sellers in IWM."
"1772570","1776550"," This is a ticker for you to grab a or firm. "
"1776810","1779170"," I already have them but I'll full disclosure."
"1779530","1784330"," I bought a bunch of single IWM calls heading into the new year."
"1785030","1788070"," And then I also have some spreads in IWM. "
"1788070","1795510"," You can watch the bottom right hand side that eventually sooner than later it's going to blast off."
"1795630","1797330"," You'll see a nice fat squeeze on IWM."
"1798290","1799950"," It should blast to 230. "
"1800430","1805530"," It has the most potential of all three indexes right now to trade much, much higher."
"1806230","1807510"," Much, much, much higher."
"1808330","1815710"," If you check that video from last night you can actually see my point behind the potential in IWM. "
"1815710","1821770"," I only trade out even I'm a weeklies, monthlies, one to three month out trades anyways."
"1822190","1823170"," If I'm going long or short."
"1826370","1830810"," And if you look back on Tesla here on the left and right hand side, you see that the buyers"
"1830810","1832330"," are starting to consume the sellers. "
"1833610","1834670"," We're almost there."
"1835590","1836530"," Just a little bit of time."
"1836870","1840110"," If you guys have an entry to trade now and you want to wait for that moment, you'll be looking"
"1840110","1841610"," forward to my bottom right hand on my screen. "
"1841610","1844950"," We had that moment when the buyers consume the sellers."
"1845690","1847370"," And you can enter a trade at that point."
"1851150","1852150"," The VIX at 20. "
"1852870","1855270"," Yeah, you know, I really want to see the VIX."
"1855370","1856530"," I'll take a look at the VIX right now."
"1856690","1857830"," I really want to see the VIX. "
"1858270","1861570"," I'd like to see this week a slow grind up."
"1862030","1867390"," Let's say we get spied up for 70."
"1869750","1874570"," If we get the VIX, if we get a slow grind up between now and Friday, but Thursday. "
"1875850","1879190"," To hit the targets that we're looking for this week, maybe a sell off into the weekend."
"1880530","1886810"," And some kind of a VIX up to, if I get a VIX at 30 for like half day on"
"1886810","1892650"," Thursday, I'd be rad because that would be the tipping of the card saying that we are."
"1893630","1900270"," Going to 480 on the spy for the first couple weeks of January. "
"1901410","1902870"," Look at this real quick here."
"1910000","1915180"," You know where the buy areas are on the spy this morning if you checked out my video from last"
"1915180","1915540"," night."
"1915740","1916980"," The video lays it all out. "
"1917400","1918340"," It's pretty basic."
"1919020","1921300"," It's not really that hard to be tracking."
"1922740","1924480"," Let's take a look at this. "
"1929740","1932020"," The idea of him still in a grind right now."
"1932420","1933060"," Which sucks."
"1933280","1934000"," I want to see the idea of him. "
"1934160","1935680"," I want to see it rip like today."
"1936360","1937180"," I want it next week."
"1937320","1940060"," I want to like right now that just huge climb that it's going to do. "
"1943360","1943780"," Yep."
"1944560","1945620"," Tesla's moving up dude."
"1945900","1948100"," Tesla breaks through this wall at 9, 8, 985. "
"1949040","1950100"," It's going to a thousand."
"1951340","1955660"," If you start grinding through that thousand wall, there's clear skies above."
"1956600","1959960"," I'll tell you what if you if you grind through 1000 on Tesla. "
"1960640","1963700"," There is that number of people with interest."
"1964320","1965360"," There is nothing."
"1965660","1970220"," You guys want to see the how high up the skies are on Tesla. "
"1972830","1974290"," Maybe a rocket ship."
"1975550","1976910"," Straight rocket ship."
"1980220","1983480"," I don't know if I can get this to see if I can show you guys. "
"1984160","1988460"," It's basically just clear skies on Tesla above 1000."
"1989140","1995860"," You'll start to you'll start to set some some squeezage."
"1996220","1999580"," And not only would you squeeze the shorts like the short squeezes are good. "
"2000640","2007380"," But they're not anywhere near as good as a good short squeeze with the overloading of calls,"
"2007380","2010040"," especially short dated ones."
"2010580","2011940"," You get some monster."
"2012620","2014320"," Yeah, you would blast out. "
"2014440","2015760"," You probably blast off to 1100."
"2015760","2017980"," Probably see an extra 100 points on the board."
"2019840","2025320"," There's a lot of potential here for Tesla to squeeze much higher for the holidays, right?"
"2025840","2027040"," Get some nice fat profits. "
"2028680","2031200"," You do want to be aware of this 990 right here."
"2031340","2031780"," This is new."
"2033060","2035020"," It's 990 is some concern. "
"2035240","2036280"," You see the buyers in here."
"2037120","2037800"," They're still there."
"2037940","2044360"," So you're getting buyers at you got volume of 11,525 at 985. "
"2045140","2046440"," Tesla's got some great bulls."
"2046900","2047960"," I always love testables."
"2049139","2051159"," They know fair ever. "
"2051580","2053219"," I love that."
"2057400","2059679"," I love that Tesla always has buyers."
"2062870","2067170"," It's a good place to leave it for right now between 960 and 1000. "
"2072210","2073530"," Always love testables."
"2074070","2074670"," And we saw some."
"2074929","2075489"," That's weird. "
"2076050","2082170"," So if you guys check out TLT, we had some TLT puts come in yesterday and we're up on TLT"
"2082170","2082670"," this morning."
"2083330","2084830"," So I don't know what I haven't checked."
"2084870","2087730"," I have to check the actual raw flow on TLT. "
"2087989","2092650"," But there were some interest in dumping and I can see why they're looking for a."
"2094630","2095850"," Continuation of a."
"2099320","2102260"," I'm going to have to watch TLT today because of TLT."
"2102880","2108040"," Is able to go down if we see more put flow in TLT would be an explosive move."
"2110820","2113680"," Yeah, it does look like Vex is hitting just heads up. "
"2113680","2114600"," Someone mentioned this."
"2114720","2115380"," I don't know who was."
"2115880","2117680"," You guys got to be aware right now. "
"2118480","2124220"," Who mentioned Vex Henry Henry is pointing out something you guys should be aware of at the moment."
"2124660","2126280"," I'm on the five minute on the Vex."
"2126300","2127300"," I'm going to move to the two minute. "
"2129180","2131980"," And we're coming into like a localized bottom."
"2133340","2135080"," Right here at 20."
"2135400","2137380"," Matter of fact, I have it charted out at 2016. "
"2138360","2141460"," Be conscious of this level at 2016 in the Vex."
"2141460","2143140"," This is bad in the past."
"2144160","2145840"," A point of. "
"2148820","2151400"," Yeah, we start seeing like some resistance, usually."
"2152300","2156160"," Looking at the three months right now when we start bouncing around here at 20."
"2156840","2160780"," We could trade sideways from here and dip down below to 14. "
"2161300","2164100"," Or we reject off it and we go much higher."
"2164400","2169540"," So maybe on a short term basis, just be cautious as we come into this."
"2170700","2172040"," Twenty, but this. "
"2172300","2181760"," If you look back, if you look back in September and early October, the Vex dips down here."
"2182100","2183900"," There's a nice little movement down."
"2187700","2189140"," But that's a good point, Henry. "
"2189700","2190240"," Good eyes."
"2190440","2190980"," My brother."
"2192720","2194060"," It's right where I've got. "
"2194400","2200520"," It's right where I've got some basing for the Vex is on 20, 2016 is where I've got it."
"2200520","2208120"," We look like we're basing at twenty point twenty one, about twenty point twenty sixteen."
"2208600","2209060"," I have enough. "
"2209240","2211240"," This chart that I'm looking at is not my normal charting."
"2211540","2212500"," It's on another computer."
"2218660","2219320"," Good eyes. "
"2220020","2220340"," Good."
"2220440","2220640"," Good."
"2220860","2221320"," Good eyes. "
"2221580","2221740"," Henry."
"2226020","2230720"," Henry Abattos is calling saying this to Tesla nine ninety nine one thousand call sweeps."
"2232580","2236820"," I'm looking at my flow and see what's going on with flow this morning. "
"2237560","2240120"," We update you guys on live stream."
"2240780","2242100"," What's happening with the flow this morning?"
"2242100","2243020"," Where's the real money going?"
"2243640","2244920"," Let's take a look and see."
"2248690","2253590"," See where everyone's where everyone's spending there instead of buying presents for people there. "
"2254470","2255230"," Oh, yeah."
"2255410","2257030"," We got Tesla calls coming in like crazy."
"2258250","2259250"," It's surprising too. "
"2259510","2265210"," I think Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley was talking about selling profit on a PFE."
"2265210","2268750"," A Pfizer and I see lots of PFE calls."
"2269210","2273160"," I wonder why is Pfizer dumping?"
"2277820","2278200"," Yeah. "
"2278340","2279040"," Stumping a little bit."
"2281500","2286940"," That could be a, you know, Pfizer could be a good short for you guys."
"2287240","2289620"," You've got big banks telling people to sell Pfizer. "
"2290000","2292100"," It's probably part of a cell program from them."
"2293920","2294440"," Terrible."
"2294820","2295280"," Terrible. "
"2295420","2296380"," The banks do this stuff."
"2298160","2300780"," There's a lot of PFE call flow, but that's dangerous."
"2301640","2303240"," It is dangerous. "
"2303240","2305140"," Unless the banks are making that up."
"2305600","2305800"," Okay."
"2306000","2307060"," So for Bush flow this morning. "
"2307960","2310840"," Number one bullish flow is Tesla."

"2317060","2321880"," 1231, 1050s, 1231, 1005s and 1000s. "
"2322300","2326180"," Big money, $1.5 million on a 1231, 1005."
"2326540","2327400"," That's a big bet."
"2328020","2329240"," That's a real big bet. "
"2329240","2333780"," That's the number one flow right now in the market is going into Tesla."
"2335940","2339060"," So yeah, I'd be a buyer down at 960, 940."
"2339620","2341720"," I'm going to jump in on some calls myself. "
"2342560","2346060"," Nvidia is the next one with the most flow at $1.7 million."
"2346840","2356720"," It looks like it's focused on 1223, 300s, right in the money and 1223 or excuse me, 1231,"
"2357100","2357980"," 300s too."
"2357980","2363080"," So centered around 292.5, 280 mostly on 300s. "
"2365040","2367060"," TSM with a great bid this morning."
"2367680","2377680"," TSM is that has a nice concentration on 121 January 21st for 117 and $127."
"2378520","2379560"," I'm assuming that's a call spread. "
"2380560","2386300"," And that's not because not matching up for the numbers and then a strike of 118 for the 23rd."
"2388180","2390240"," ABT with a very unusual option."

"2450010","2452410"," And I'll go over the flow for that one real quick. "
"2453170","2462670"," It's a 122338 C and 10 or 1231 40 C and January"
"2462670","2463810"," 7 40 C."
"2464090","2467530"," If you buy calls like this date them slightly farther out."
"2467530","2472370"," Okay, so if you're buying like a 38 call by it for a week or two later by a 40"
"2472370","2476590"," call by for a month later a week later in case you see some dealer hedging."
"2476830","2482110"," And what they'll try to do is kill that that call and they'll spring it up later because there's so"
"2482110","2482590"," much interest. "

"2613500","2617740"," Because of the hedge wall because of the way the game is set up on Palantir with the hedging."

"2735040","2735960"," Oh, that's nice."
"2736680","2738620"," TSM's got a great bow flag on it."
"2739620","2741080"," Actually, TSM is a great play. "
"2742400","2744300"," And just wait for it to cool off a little bit."
"2744440","2746700"," Don't be whatever I call these think these tickers out."
"2747060","2751620"," You don't want to buy in calls right on the on the giant green bar. "
"2753080","2754340"," You want to be waiting."
"2754980","2759080"," So if we're reversing trend here, you want to just give it a minute to cool off and then grab."
"2759580","2761040"," Some calls on TSM. "
"2761440","2762420"," TSM looks real good."
"2763080","2765540"," TSM might just actually squeeze all day long today."
"2766060","2767100"," I wouldn't surprise me. "
"2768820","2770600"," You could probably just jump in TSM."
"2771160","2773060"," I'm going to have to trade that here in just a little bit actually."
"2774320","2776600"," I'm going to put a buy in order on TSM. "

"2798260","2799120"," TSM man."
"2799260","2800360"," Check that ticker out right now."
"2801260","2802640"," It's like straight green bars. "
"2804640","2806340"," Maybe there's some news about."
"2809180","2811660"," Yeah, TSM is going bonkers right now."
"2815490","2820010"," Yeah, I think I thought I thought I, you know, I thought I got to Oracle. "
"2820810","2822170"," I'll look at it right now."
"2822710","2829250"," So the, I thought I either posted about Oracle or I meant to and didn't."
"2830530","2831950"," Oracle was on my radar. "
"2832850","2833970"," We're a CL right."
"2834570","2836110"," Why is this not typing here?"
"2840320","2841940"," Yeah, it's one of my biggest flaws to."
"2843180","2845720"," It's one of my biggest flaws to tickers. "
"2846720","2851540"," Like when I see green bars, sometimes I'll just jump in and then get out in 15 or 15."
"2852640","2854400"," I'm just in it and then I'm out of it."
"2854920","2856360"," Because you know it's coming back down. "
"2857260","2860200"," You know without a doubt, it's coming back down, even if it's just for a breather."
"2860660","2863520"," But you want to catch that light in a bottle for a minute or two, too."
"2864180","2864760"," So I get it. "
"2865240","2866080"," I do the same thing."
"2872820","2874300"," So this is a good buy in for Oracle."
"2876000","2877700"," Get some sellers above it 91. "
"2878920","2879300"," Maybe not."
"2879760","2880760"," I might have spoke too soon."
"2881100","2881980"," Be careful with Oracle. "
"2882320","2882400"," Okay."
"2883520","2884960"," I see what your point is though."
"2885140","2885740"," You want to be buying. "
"2885920","2886420"," You're trying to buy."
"2886420","2887240"," Yeah, it's actually goodbye."
"2887720","2891340"," Anything between $85 and $90 should be a goodbye. "
"2891540","2892440"," I don't have a ton of sellers."
"2892620","2894520"," You get out some grinding going on in Oracle this morning."
"2895120","2897880"," It looks like your first big resistance is at 110. "
"2898960","2900120"," Good shout out in Oracle."
"2900840","2901320"," Right on."
"2902080","2903240"," I like that Oracle play. "
"2904580","2905860"," Put a little bit of time on it."
"2906340","2907000"," Do an Oracle."
"2907280","2908240"," Spread would be bad too. "
"2909080","2911140"," Find out when the puts are coming off Oracle."
"2912860","2914520"," I like the idea of the Oracle trade."
"2919940","2922300"," Why is 960 turning turning yellow?"
"2922520","2923340"," Let's take a look back at Tesla. "
"2928980","2929380"," Okay."
"2929600","2931500"," So what are we looking for here?"
"2931660","2934280"," Can Tesla or when you're watching this chart with me."
"2934500","2936280"," I don't have any indicators up right now. "
"2936300","2937100"," I can turn some on."
"2937300","2939320"," But what you guys to see is this, right?"
"2940500","2943520"," Is that when you see these yellow lines down here."
"2943680","2944780"," This is where smart money is. "
"2945100","2947800"," You won't be able to take every single trade out there."
"2948020","2952980"," So what you're trying to do is build yourself a list of 100 to 300 tickers."
"2953740","2957980"," On your own charting software, you sell alerts where the smart money is. "
"2958640","2965140"," And if you can be like a sociopath, you trade the ticker at the price that the banks are trading"
"2965140","2965380"," at."
"2965780","2968840"," So you know you've got buyers down below here at 960, right?"
"2969420","2973540"," You know, you've got some buyers up here at 970, some more up here at 975."
"2974400","2976260"," But right here, you've got some resistance. "
"2976560","2979220"," This is minor resistance at 985."
"2979220","2981820"," You've got some more resistance at 990."
"2982300","2984200"," And then big resistance up here at 1000. "
"2984940","2988960"," What you'll find is that sellers will swoop down."
"2989200","2990500"," You can see them on the right here."
"2990940","2995460"," They'll swoop down and try and try to get either get out of their positions. "
"2996180","3005240"," You know, you know, you relate this to is you're by a top of a stock and you hold and"
"3005240","3006320"," you hold and you hold."
"3006320","3011400"," And then you don't know if it's quite ever coming back again."
"3011840","3017580"," And but you see it come up and close to where you're stuck or you're trapped once, twice, three"
"3017580","3018080"," times. "
"3018560","3025620"," And you're looking for that capitulation moment as a buyer from those last people that are holding"
"3025620","3031980"," on any ticker to finally capitulate and sell."
"3031980","3036880"," And when you see that capitulation, you'll break through these big walls up here at 1000."
"3037500","3042700"," And that's what you're seeing right now is some capitulation by sellers that are trapped. "
"3045710","3047270"," You want to see that capitulation."
"3047790","3052990"," And you see that capitulation that wall or that that that river of sellers coming down."
"3053670","3056210"," It shows that you have room to move much, much higher. "
"3057790","3060990"," So how do you how do you day trade Tesla if you weren't already in Tesla."
"3062630","3065650"," You're going to set an alert down here at 975 970."
"3066410","3071730"," See what the reaction is and see if this river comes up to match at 970. "
"3072350","3077890"," If they stay down here and don't come up, you're going to set your buy for day trade today or"
"3077890","3078930"," tomorrow at 960."
"3079630","3081550"," Unless we see this river move up higher."
"3082450","3087150"," So that's what you want to be seeing is this river come up and start to build itself into this"
"3087150","3088430"," 97975. "
"3088430","3093210"," And it is you'll see this, you'll see this by is turning much, much more white."
"3093730","3097530"," That's buyers down here moving up over here to try to grab a bid."
"3100340","3102040"," And I'll show you this here. "
"3104320","3110300"," You see now that we have buyers are in control of Tesla bottom right hand side."
"3110740","3112380"," See the buyers are in charge here."
"3113340","3116080"," So buyers are taking over in Tesla right now. "
"3116080","3119780"," And you remember at the open the sellers were in charge."
"3122120","3124660"," TSM is going through them to the moon right now."
"3130390","3136330"," TSM is in straight straight up straight up right now. "
"3137050","3138170"," See, this is where I get in trouble."
"3139010","3141210"," Getting trouble to trade tickers like TSM."
"3145110","3146490"," TSM is a straight moonshot. "
"3151220","3154740"," Probably going to be looking right here on TSM at 119."
"3155200","3157120"," I'll bring up the TSM chart for you."
"3157120","3159520"," So you guys can see what's going on TSM. "
"3159960","3162880"," There might be some resistance here with trap sellers."
"3169850","3171550"," TSM is going to be a fun feed to watch."
"3173370","3175690"," You watch feeds like this on a squeeze day. "
"3175970","3177650"," You can actually see what I'm talking about."
"3182930","3183370"," Yep."
"3184030","3184910"," And that's to be expected. "
"3186810","3189130"," So see how you see nothing down below here."
"3189190","3191690"," It's because all the buyers you see more."
"3191850","3195030"," There are slightly more buyers and sellers in TSM. "
"3195030","3199170"," But you'll see that there's this sea of black down here, right?"
"3199390","3199630"," Dark blue."
"3200070","3202170"," That's because all your buyers are right here."
"3202670","3207190"," These buyers are just pushing, pushing, pushing on TSM. "
"3207850","3210110"," We're all your buyers are at the Seattle line down here."
"3210450","3217230"," You'll see there's light resistance at 119.50. There's a little bit more, not as much in 1980."
"3217470","3222250"," But if you break through this 120 here, there's just blue skies above. "
"3223570","3224870"," Blue skies above to 121."
"3227270","3232910"," And just so you know, just as a heads up, your major resistance on TSM is 125."
"3233970","3236570"," You'll start to find heavy volatility at 124. "
"3237990","3241650"," Your call wall is probably at 129, 130 somewhere in there."
"3242250","3244890"," And then you'll see where the smart money is down below here."
"3245550","3246330"," Smart money is at 110. "
"3247290","3251850"," So if you're looking, if you're a conservative trader, you're going to be setting an alert at 110"
"3251850","3252510"," today."
"3252690","3254350"," Hopefully you get a swing down."
"3254910","3257850"," You'll start to find buyers at 113, 114. "
"3258730","3260670"," And the real buy is probably at 110."
"3262390","3268470"," And the roof right now is at 125 on TSM, which makes sense."
"3269270","3274450"," You can actually compare this to a regular candlestick chart. "
"3275610","3282350"," Take a snapshot of this 110, 113, 119, 124 to 125."
"3283330","3284810"," And then 130 above."
"3286510","3291510"," Snap those lines, set yourself some alerts, move on to the next ticker. "
"3301990","3304250"," We take a look at what you guys are talking about."
"3308250","3310990"," Keep buying Tesla and can't sell, only hold."
"3311730","3313970"," Yeah, just this is just a heads up on Tesla. "
"3315610","3319270"," This is just a heads up on Vix's diving with TES right on."
"3319390","3320190"," Good to hear you say that."
"3320470","3321290"," I'm able to check. "
"3323760","3326520"," Thank you for the update, Henry, on the Tesla calls."
"3327100","3328660"," Y'all got to realize that."
"3330000","3330980"," I'm telling you. "
"3332440","3334500"," It's, it's, uh, it's Hanukkah."
"3334620","3335080"," It's Christmas."
"3335400","3335980"," It's Kwanza. "
"3336200","3338160"," It's pagan holiday season."
"3339060","3340420"," You're going to see some interest."
"3340800","3342660"," People want to, people want to have some fun over the holidays. "
"3343240","3345540"," You know that there's people sitting around their holiday."
"3347340","3352420"," Families chatting with family members saying if you bought a Tesla yet, you know this goes on"
"3352420","3353400"," around this time of year."
"3353840","3354800"," You get that feeling. "
"3354800","3356160"," You had a good year with Tesla."
"3356200","3357220"," It was a great year for Tesla."
"3357580","3362840"," I mean, you guys all know, some of you guys that are here right now, remember this summer in May,"
"3363380","3367680"," started summer when I started doing the crazy chalkboard drawings with my hair in a mess. "
"3367840","3369880"," And I'm like, it's turning around."
"3370460","3373120"," We're going to have a huge summer Tesla summer here."
"3373120","3379600"," Please, you know, I think there was, there's at least four or five of you that, uh, we haven't had"
"3379600","3383080"," private conversations with a private feed on trading view. "
"3383200","3385900"," And I'm trying to sound like a crazy person."
"3386080","3387420"," And you guys trusted me."
"3387880","3389680"," I didn't talk to the public about it. "
"3389900","3396980"," And sure enough, Tesla went from some stupid low number, five 60 or something to 1200."
"3397220","3401740"," I got out before that, but there's a little bit too much, a little bit too rich at that point"
"3401740","3402140"," for me."
"3402140","3405120"," But, uh, you'll see that happen right now. "
"3405560","3410300"," You know, people had a good year with Tesla and they want to see Tesla crank for the holidays."
"3413670","3415330"," Yeah, you want to see that up."
"3415470","3417590"," You want to see the options flow get up to like 1100. "
"3418250","3420130"," You want to see people pound in like 1200."
"3420730","3424130"," You want to see the day trader step in because day traders don't care."
"3424790","3425570"," Like, so I'm a day trader. "
"3426290","3428670"," When I trade Tesla, like right now, we're currently at."
"3429830","3431750"," I'm not buying anything unless it's no less."
"3431750","3435390"," I want to play by 1100s, 1200s. "
"3436830","3439950"," Stuff that's not going to expire."
"3441330","3443790"," In the money, but stuff that'll print."
"3444990","3450270"," You know, 300 400 500% 1000% stuff like that. "
"3450490","3454010"," You guys shouldn't take that financial advice ever when I talk about that stuff."
"3455410","3458230"," Yeah, scalpers paradise and Tesla calls definitely."
"3458230","3465130"," I think every day someone comes in and tells me that spy is getting bearish on the outside. "
"3467030","3469010"," I have no offense to you."
"3469090","3470030"," No offense to either."
"3471190","3471630"," Paul. "
"3475400","3476400"," Yeah, no, that's not."
"3476620","3480300"," I can see how you're interpreting this interpreting this as bearish."
"3480900","3482500"," But you guys have my charts, right?"
"3482640","3483560"," You know where the by is. "
"3484120","3485700"," I told you where the by was."
"3485800","3488180"," It said about the by is that for the last night's video."
"3488820","3491960"," Right by is that 46461 is a gift. "
"3492220","3494760"," I think that's like quote and quote myself last night."
"3495400","3497400"," 460 to 461 is a gift."
"3498100","3499580"," And where did I say it was going?"
"3500320","3505420"," I said you're going to not encounter volatility until 465 466. "
"3506320","3511420"," Told you that that once you break through that volatility, it's going to make an attempt at 470."
"3512320","3516160"," So no, I don't see anything bearish here and spy at all."
"3516160","3517200"," Nothing. "
"3517840","3521300"," You got you guys should watch my videos like take the half an hour."
"3522080","3523640"," Watch my videos closely."
"3524480","3530440"," We're in positive gamma on spy, especially if you're bearish and you if you're even just trying to"
"3530440","3538080"," be bearish right now, you're looking for a rejection between 465 and 466. "
"3538840","3543780"," And even then right now we can bring spy up and see what's going to happen right here."
"3544540","3553040"," You're going to see, you know, if we don't ricochet off 465 466, then you know that you're being"
"3553040","3554240"," absorbed as a seller."
"3554660","3558780"," You know that the liquidity is coming in to push us up higher. "
"3559260","3565140"," Even if we rest above 466 to consolidate to move to 470."
"3565140","3571800"," And so we'll look at the spy real quick, especially for reaching out and saying that's looking"
"3571800","3573920"," bearish, Paul, because I like your interaction."
"3574500","3577480"," I like that you say what you're thinking, especially if it's not if it's not crazy. "
"3577960","3581260"," That's not a crazy thought that it's bearish because it can't that does."
"3581640","3583440"," That's a typical bearish setup."
"3584820","3585940"," Where it is right now. "
"3587560","3590200"," And yeah, so this is proven the point here."
"3590560","3593520"," So we're coming into 465, right?"
"3594370","3600960"," So we've got slightly less buyers than sellers on on spy right now."
"3601640","3609800"," Your level if you're looking as a bear to take a take a quick short, you're looking for 4680 as"
"3609800","3611320"," the first rejection point. "
"3612920","3615200"," But if the buyers step in here."
"3616280","3619260"," This is for all of you out there so you guys can see what's going on."
"3619920","3623660"," Oh wow, so the sellers have moved down heads up to all of you. "
"3624120","3627620"," So big walls come in on the spy at 465."
"3628060","3628720"," Good eyes, Paul."
"3628940","3630560"," I'm glad I followed up on you. "
"3630940","3634980"," I always want to listen to some of you bears out there to keep you guys in mind."
"3635560","3639520"," Because I don't want to be I don't want to be making an assumption here."
"3639820","3641360"," Look on a big time frame here. "
"3643660","3646220"," So you've got bears that are doubling down here."
"3646480","3648460"," Bears are doubling down."
"3648460","3651060"," This is a good warning for you out there. "
"3651260","3652680"," Why you guys to realize something?"
"3653200","3660960"," If we break through 465 or you've got a little bit of so so you've got a small wall at"
"3660960","3661480"," 470."
"3662400","3664480"," You've got bears doubling down right now."
"3664520","3665500"," It's funny to see. "
"3666140","3671300"," So the wall has come down from 470 to 465."
"3672820","3676900"," What's interesting about this is you've got more buyers than sellers here."
"3676900","3681680"," With this wall coming down or these bears coming down to this 465 level. "
"3682000","3685140"," If you guys are watching right now, you see the buyers stepping in on spy."
"3685740","3687280"," You see you have more buyers and sellers."
"3687880","3694980"," There's a fair chance that spy is going to rip to 470 today. "
"3696600","3699000"," And possibly 480 in the next day."
"3701260","3701860"," This is good."
"3702560","3704820"," We might get real high numbers today. "
"3705540","3706280"," This is wild."
"3708950","3710010"," It wasn't even paying attention."
"3715160","3716920"," So bears have stepped up their game. "
"3717940","3723620"," The walls were at 470 at 470 as of yesterday."
"3724220","3727500"," And this morning it looks like the walls come down on spy."
"3727980","3730040"," It's becoming very squeezable right now. "
"3730920","3731480"," The spy is."
"3732220","3734800"," And now you've got more buyers stepping in the spy this morning."
"3735560","3736680"," I've got a ton of spy calls. "
"3737660","3739800"," This makes me feel good, to be honest."
"3740360","3741960"," But yeah, if you're bearish."
"3742360","3747120"," If you are listening to this feed right now and you have the bearish thesis that we're going to"
"3747120","3749860"," correct at this point, which I don't believe we should have corrected. "
"3750380","3754340"," We should have corrected yesterday under 460."
"3755080","3764300"," If you wanted to see that corrective action continue, it should have taken place yesterday at"
"3764300","3766500"," before 1 p.m. It should have taken place."
"3767420","3771020"," And so the inferences that we're going up. "
"3771360","3776400"," So I'm assuming that people are doubling down to protect their profits here at 465."
"3777280","3781380"," Because yesterday we had light resistance between 465 for 66."
"3782340","3784540"," And we had more way more resistance up at 470. "
"3786520","3789560"," So you can see that some people are some people are."
"3791120","3795960"," Consolidating their bear thesis at 464.90 and 465."
"3798140","3799360"," Which is interesting. "
"3800340","3801780"," I find this very interesting."
"3802500","3809340"," Because if you break through 465 here, you had clear skies to 470, but not 478."
"3810080","3817180"," If you break through this wall at 465, you would have nothing stopping you to 478. "
"3817180","3819680"," It would just go straight straight up."
"3820920","3824700"," This is an interesting development into today."
"3825100","3826420"," Good job, Paul, bringing that up. "
"3827040","3829980"," Always call me out, Paul, when you see something out there."
"3833230","3835530"," What's the next level we're seeing on spy cap?"
"3836370","3838890"," Yeah, so yesterday you had levels at 465."
"3839230","3842950"," Oh, see the light level yesterday at 465, 466. "
"3843770","3845250"," Your major level was at 470."
"3845250","3848890"," And then it was clear skies to 478."
"3849530","3853490"," But this morning it looks like bears are doubling down right at 465. "
"3856370","3858830"," So let's look at the go back to Tesla feed."
"3861390","3862950"," I'm going to have to sign off here eventually."
"3863110","3863370"," I need to. "
"3866880","3872420"," You're seeing more sellers stepping in on Tesla at 990."
"3873480","3874440"," Some capitulation."
"3876280","3881400"," Again, you know, if you guys don't want to grind your calls out on Tesla, always take some profit"
"3881400","3883480"," and then just set some alerts. "
"3883560","3886280"," Sentiments to 975, 979, 60."
"3886680","3891520"," If any of you guys panic in this zone here, you see this thin, this nice thin red line right"
"3891520","3891760"," here."
"3892140","3894560"," This is eating callers are sellers. "
"3895020","3896980"," So they're starting to come down lower and lower."
"3899640","3901740"," And yeah, your big walls at 1000."
"3906280","3907280"," Thanks for the update. "
"3907280","3908020"," Hatch on Oracle."
"3911430","3912430"," Yeah, blood stunt."
"3912650","3915090"," I'm sitting on a bunch of calls on spy. "
"3915990","3919970"," Heading into the end of the month, the 31st."
"3920730","3925090"," Or the 29th, I think on some of them that I get a bunch of spreads into January 5th."
"3926330","3928870"," And then I've got some IWM stuff rocking too. "
"3931670","3935250"," Everything's looking everything's looking very, very squeezy."
"3936390","3936850"," More than normal."
"3938490","3939330"," More than normal. "
"3939630","3940690"," You know the big guys know this."
"3942050","3943610"," You know the big banks know this."
"3943610","3946310"," You know the banks are going to try to set each other up. "
"3950660","3952200"," This will be interesting in the spy."
"3953300","3957500"," I have to keep the spy up now because I know when this happens."
"3957840","3959980"," You either get you're either going to grind here in the spy. "
"3960320","3961620"," Just keep grinding and grinding."
"3961980","3964080"," You guys know that the buyers are here."
"3964680","3966260"," I hope you all know that the buyers are here. "
"3968260","3970380"," And this just looks like minor resistance."
"3971920","3976220"," If we if we break through heads up tell all of you out there if we break through four six"
"3976220","3979160"," five four six six at any point."
"3980160","3981880"," There are Claire skies to 480. "
"3982860","3984080"," Keep that in mind."
"3984660","3987740"," That is how many points."
"3988560","3989640"," That's stupid right. "
"3990360","3992320"," It's like 200 points."
"3994120","3997680"," And if there's no there's there's no resistance up there for 80 either."
"3997680","3999640"," So sky's the limit I guess. "
"4001260","4003060"," And I'm wasn't expecting this."
"4003060","4005600"," I'm expecting 480 like January."
"4007680","4010320"," So I don't know what quite is going on here at the moment. "
"4013170","4014990"," Maybe you guys can chime in what you think."
"4019360","4021240"," 200 of mine expire today."
"4022440","4023920"," Yeah, Tesla high of day. "
"4024160","4026140"," Yeah, the buyers are there on Tesla right now."
"4026420","4029040"," You can see if you look closely here, right?"
"4029580","4030340"," Look down here on the right."
"4030820","4033620"," You have 847,000 buyers. "
"4033620","4035520"," Eight hundred, well, eight."
"4036220","4040360"," Eight hundred and fifty thousand buyers and only eight hundred and twelve thousand sellers."
"4040920","4043960"," They are being absorbed right now. "
"4044160","4045620"," There's capitulation going on."
"4046380","4050680"," And you're eventually going to see a thousand for what's what's in front of us at this moment."
"4051560","4053640"," You're going to see a thousand probably today. "
"4054660","4057620"," Well, for what's being presented to us."
"4059820","4061660"," What do you have expiring today?"
"4061820","4063000"," Is it all spy stuff?"
"4064420","4066960"," Yeah, I don't want to break a big time break out."
"4067800","4068560"," Big time. "
"4069320","4072440"," The potential squeeze on I don't know if you have as huge."
"4073440","4077900"," I mean, I don't know if I'm moving up to 230 would would be a printing machine."
"4080450","4084070"," Yeah, so the JPM caller came off, I think. "
"4085630","4089750"," On the 17th and then the new caller was put on afterwards."
"4091430","4093050"," For this next quarter."
"4095170","4098270"," And I think the first caller lost some money. "
"4099010","4100950"," And then this caller is much higher."
"4104880","4106020"," The last caller was low."
"4106520","4109180"," The last caller is part of what took us down in November and December. "
"4110240","4110680"," You guys."
"4111979","4116220"," When I talk to you guys about volatility dropping off, it's because of these callers."
"4116220","4118100"," We wind up. "
"4118720","4124200"," Not always, but typically what you'll see is you'll see depending upon the width of the caller."
"4124880","4128479"," You'll end up seeing like low volatility for the beginning of a quarter."
"4128979","4130260"," First, usually not always. "
"4131340","4134580"," There's lots of other factors, but generally speaking, right?"
"4134720","4138740"," You'll see low volatility first month and a half, two months."
"4139020","4140240"," Then that last month of the quarter."
"4140240","4145180"," That's when you see some big volatility coming to the market because they're trying to print the"
"4145180","4146859"," downside of their caller. "
"4149399","4150680"," I have IWM."
"4153580","4158979"," If you, some safe or in my view, not financial advice, some safe."
"4159859","4164800"," IWM calls are like mid January, late January in the money. "
"4165720","4169380"," And call spreads and you're looking for 230."
"4170120","4175420"," If you do like an in the money to 230 expiring in late January, February."
"4176700","4181800"," Mid January is a little bit more risky early January is a little risky, but it wouldn't surprise"
"4181800","4182180"," me. "
"4183660","4185800"," Wouldn't surprise me at all to see."
"4188529","4191410"," We'll get this in a little bit closer."
"4192170","4192609"," Yep. "
"4193130","4195770"," Just adds up buyers are winning right now in Tesla."
"4195850","4198990"," If you don't know this buyers are winning."
"4199570","4202970"," This is the only truth to me is this feed right here. "
"4203370","4204030"," This is the feed."
"4204150","4206930"," All the hedge funds you use now all of them, but a lot of them use the trade."
"4207810","4209870"," And you can see real time order flow. "
"4211270","4215190"," And have it put into a, like a painting showing you."
"4216890","4217830"," What's going on?"
"4218250","4221870"," And we should see 1000 as of right now as what's in front of us."
"4222890","4226230"," That'd be a buyer at 949 79 75. "
"4227030","4228410"," That's where all the buyers were."
"4229750","4231790"," All right now smart money is in 1940."
"4237710","4238390"," Hey, you trope. "
"4238910","4239110"," Okay."
"4239390","4240970"," So some of you guys are just joining."
"4241230","4242350"," Let's talk about book map. "
"4242890","4245010"," This is a live order flow."
"4245230","4251190"," This is one of the professional traders use this software with a live data feeds for cash, market"
"4251190","4251850"," and Globex."
"4252930","4255190"," And when you hear people talk about. "
"4257670","4261730"," This isn't so much positive gamma has more to do with the order flow."
"4262210","4265530"," Tie this in with with volatility levels."
"4266150","4269450"," So that you can form a support and resistance levels. "
"4270090","4273290"," On a day to day basis for whatever you're trading."
"4273630","4275550"," So if I'm trading Tesla today."
"4276450","4277690"," And I just came out. "
"4277810","4280390"," Let's say I woke up right just now as I'm drinking last night."
"4280850","4282130"," Everyone's talking about Tesla."
"4282710","4283150"," Today. "
"4285010","4285450"," Right."
"4285570","4286650"," I do all my due diligence."
"4288390","4293650"," So I'm looking where liquidity is on Tesla right now for where where do I want to join into the"
"4293650","4294670"," fray as a trader. "
"4297540","4298360"," So let's see."
"4298500","4299580"," Let's see where all the money is."
"4299640","4301160"," Let's see where the smart money is on Tesla. "
"4303060","4308540"," We know from earlier because we've been here all morning since 930 that the banks are at 940."
"4309880","4312380"," So you start wondering yourself, what are they going to take profit?"
"4313020","4315880"," Looks like they're trying to tag 1000 for profit."
"4317680","4323720"," I'm also looking for do we have more buyers than sellers. "
"4324840","4329360"," And then I'm going to look for some support resistance levels and I'm going to set some alerts on a"
"4329360","4330480"," ticker Tesla."
"4330820","4332820"," I can do it for any stock out there."
"4333080","4333160"," Right. "
"4333500","4338000"," Maybe I make a list for day trading for the day when the cash market opens and I got 20"
"4338000","4338560"," tickers."
"4339240","4346180"," I'll set an alert for Tesla today at 9.50, 9.40, 9.70. Although there are that these sellers"
"4346180","4347520"," are being consumed right now."
"4347580","4348220"," You can see it. "
"4348560","4349620"," We're about to move up guys."
"4349940","4352680"," I want you guys to know that Tesla's just about ready to move up."
"4353520","4354420"," We're getting close. "
"4355580","4357260"," We're getting close for a big move here."
"4362310","4363710"," I need to open that chart right now."
"4364790","4367010"," Then you're looking for where the resistance is above, right?"
"4367010","4373630"," You're looking for, you're starting to see some more sellers above at 10.20. This means they're"
"4373630","4374170"," getting scared. "
"4375350","4376490"," Sellers are getting scared."
"4377510","4381110"," And we just wrecked a whole bunch of sellers on Tesla."
"4382030","4383050"," So what happens?"
"4383210","4384970"," I end up knowing that before they're people, right?"
"4385630","4387010"," So I know right now. "
"4387790","4389330"," I can tell you right now."
"4390030","4391810"," Before it's even even out there."
"4393030","4395750"," The wall at 9.89 is gone. "
"4396550","4399570"," And you're more than likely going to see a push up to 1,000 here."
"4400990","4401470"," Okay."
"4402250","4404650"," Now let's see if that proves itself or not. "
"4405950","4408010"," You can see buyers down below."
"4408290","4408870"," Let me bring this down."
"4410070","4410950"," So you can see. "
"4411190","4412270"," You're going to see a push here."
"4412910","4413570"," You're ready to see."
"4413690","4414410"," You're ready to see this. "
"4414670","4421810"," So you got huge buyers stepping into 9.70, huge buyers stepping into 9.50. There is clear skies to"
"4421810","4423050"," 1000 right now."

"4537030","4538030"," Good job Tesla gang."
"4540950","4544290"," You have light resistance at 9.95. It means nothing."
"4544790","4547090"," You're going to grind straight up to 1000. "
"4549820","4551240"," Good job Tesla gang."
"4551800","4553240"," Remember right here, right?"

"4557140","4557280"," Okay. "
"4558540","4565520"," 9.97. 9.97.54. You're going to encounter turbulence."
"4565980","4568700"," Sir Captain speaking flying on Tesla airlines."
"4569500","4578860"," Expect some resistance at 9.97.54. If you break through that wall between 9.974. To 1000 and 1 "
"4578860","4584040",".25. You should your next level you're looking at is 1020. "
"4584840","4585420"," Okay."
"4586180","4587500"," We're going to switch up."
"4587620","4588120"," Here we go. "
"4588500","4589220"," Here goes Tesla."
"4591350","4592290"," Here goes Tesla."
"4593830","4595890"," I don't believe you Captain Jim. "
"4599290","4601830"," We'll add Tesla or I'd spy here."
"4605750","4607290"," Take a look at the spy feed."
"4607970","4612470"," Get all these all these spy spy savages are freaking out right now. "
"4619530","4624410"," And you're watching some capitulation on spy from the book from the bears."
"4627280","4629100"," The bears are freaking out right now."
"4629280","4630720"," This is looking very, very dude. "
"4630880","4631860"," I'm telling you right there right now."
"4631940","4633400"," This is looking very, very."
"4636800","4638160"," So before right. "
"4638800","4640660"," See these buyers stepping in right here."
"4642000","4645580"," When you see these buyers stepping in like this at this four, six, five level."
"4645780","4646680"," They are just consuming. "
"4650410","4652310"," Consuming the bears right now."
"4652390","4653790"," Bears are getting torn up."
"4654530","4655870"," Does that mean we could dip here?"
"4656050","4656210"," Sure. "
"4657650","4660490"," We're having an inflow of sellers right now."
"4660970","4662230"," At four, six, five."
"4662950","4663650"," That are somewhat. "
"4664290","4664930"," Let's see."
"4665090","4668470"," We're at seven eight or seven eighty nine to eight thirty five."
"4668890","4672050"," But when you start seeing this right above and this red below right here. "
"4672410","4675470"," This is a major battle zone for bears and bulls."
"4675470","4678130"," And I want you to be aware right here."
"4678610","4680270"," Normally you would see a ricochet. "
"4680790","4683510"," So if you're a bear right you're looking for us to ricochet."
"4683970","4686630"," Like bounce straight off four sixty five."
"4687290","4689330"," When you start to see sellers being absorbed. "
"4690350","4692570"," At a resistance point."
"4693310","4694450"," It is very bullish."
"4694990","4695150"," Okay. "
"4695390","4696670"," I want you to understand that out there."
"4697210","4700970"," You use software like this book maps so that you can see if there's a ricochet."
"4700970","4706250"," Or if it's if the sellers are being absorbed and that's what's happening right now in spy. "
"4706650","4709030"," You guys want to pay attention to spy too at this moment."
"4709370","4713810"," Spy has the potential to go very, very high today."
"4714830","4715610"," Very high. "
"4716130","4718170"," Spy could rip to all time highs today."
"4719290","4720150"," That is on the table."
"4721290","4722570"," Hope you guys know that. "
"4723850","4725730"," The way that speed is running right now."
"4726010","4726730"," You see some more."
"4726730","4730690"," Now see you see goofy stuff like this above like four six six. "
"4731110","4732610"," That ain't going to stop the buyers."
"4733370","4736670"," This right here is now your this is your major resistance today."
"4736950","4739230"," It came down from four seventy to four sixty five. "
"4740390","4742710"," This you break through this right now right."
"4743070","4744930"," There ain't nothing stopping all time highs today."
"4745030","4745810"," You can take that to the bank. "
"4750330","4752370"," We'll take one more look at spy over here."
"4752930","4756250"," I like to see this nice yellow bar and spy down here nine fifty."
"4757490","4758750"," Buyers are in the market today. "
"4759130","4761270"," You got a lot of retail bulls that are going to."
"4763650","4766050"," I'll head back to spy here in just a moment okay."
"4768110","4769070"," We'll get off Tesla. "
"4770590","4772190"," Tesla gang you know where you buy it."
"4772290","4773810"," You know you guys know where to buy Tesla right."
"4776160","4780140"," You know where to sell Tesla and actually the wall is moving up on Tesla here. "
"4780300","4781100"," This is cool to see."
"4781520","4785040"," So you've got hedges removing hedges now on Tesla."
"4785980","4788240"," Tesla was at nine ninety seven. "
"4788700","4792300"," And now they've the wall the call wall has been moved up on Tesla."
"4793000","4794980"," It was at nine ninety seven."
"4794980","4798780"," Now it's moved up to nine ninety eight and higher nine ninety nine. "
"4800400","4801620"," This is good for Tesla."
"4801900","4803280"," You're pushing the call wall up on Tesla."

"4819680","4823220"," You're seeing complacency by bulls which is good."
"4824240","4827540"," And you're actually seeing this wall go higher which is excellent. "

"4899380","4901480"," Yeah look at Nasdaq's just screaming higher."
"4901480","4906500"," I think it tagged exactly where I said to be a buyer fifteen nine. "
"4906660","4909780"," I think I said between fifteen seven and fifteen nine."
"4909780","4912520"," I said I was a buyer in Nasdaq for this morning."
"4913120","4914380"," We're about to rip guys. "
"4916100","4919020"," All signs are pointing towards the market rip right now."
"4922190","4923450"," Let me go the other way."
"4924030","4925990"," I mean look at this buyers on Tesla right now. "
"4926350","4932410"," You got nine hundred and fifty one thousand buy signal or buy actual live order flow buys versus"
"4932410","4933550"," eight ninety on Tesla."
"4939260","4940400"," Let's look at the VIX."
"4940520","4941540"," Is the VIX dying here. "
"4942360","4944320"," VIX is just getting straight murdered right."
"4944980","4945300"," Yep."
"4945840","4949380"," Okay so your next support of the VIX is down at eighteen fifty two. "
"4949820","4952960"," If you can't open a second screener whatever you're trading today."
"4953460","4956520"," And you're going to be looking for maybe slightly higher."
"4956760","4957380"," Let's call it a."
"4960060","4965020"," I'd look for some resistance next stop would be eighteen ninety eight. "
"4965660","4970820"," Or so eighteen ninety eight eighteen eighty two somewhere in there."
"4971260","4975940"," So you might get a quick push up and then a bounce off the VIX."
"4976400","4979100"," If the brick if the VIX breaks below nineteen. "
"4980340","4981780"," Then I want you to know that."
"4982900","4987460"," It's over for the bears you start breaking down below nineteen here and."
"4988780","4991160"," You will see all time highs. "
"4991940","4995700"," You'll see the VIX break down to fifteen."
"4997180","5000260"," That would give you the all time high scenario happening today."
"5001260","5002680"," I don't think it happens today. "
"5003280","5004540"," Starting to get a little bearish."
"5005500","5006200"," I'm a bull bounce."
"5006460","5007820"," I will start getting bearish. "
"5010700","5013440"," There's a little bit of basing going on on the one minute."
"5014520","5017600"," Right now you see some basing right now in the one minute."
"5017600","5019500"," Or the two minute there's some bay. "
"5019700","5022320"," There's no basing showing itself right now in the two minute."
"5022640","5027520"," Which is my favorite favorite way to watch the VIX but the one minute is revealing some basing."
"5029780","5032140"," Yeah right nine ninety three fifty two. "
"5032540","5035580"," On spot on Tesla right now."

"5130140","5133560"," There's a thousand percent we talked about or eight."
"5133680","5134760"," It'll be like eight hundred percent."
"5135760","5136720"," Something stupid. "
"5139690","5140750"," Look at that crank."

"5202900","5203860"," They don't want to they don't want. "
"5204200","5206440"," You got you got market makers saying hell no."
"5206640","5208460"," You got bears saying hell no."
"5213730","5214830"," Let me bring this. "
"5215310","5216630"," Let's get this up to date here."
"5218250","5219770"," It's wild to see right now."
"5221010","5224130"," Just this is a straight melt up grind up into. "

"5241210","5242270"," This is straight. "
"5242650","5246230"," You got to look at this from the perspective of you got to understand that when you see."
"5246730","5249750"," When you see, you should see a ricochet."
"5251030","5251510"," Right. "
"5251690","5252050"," You see it's nice."
"5252230","5253430"," This is a nice little cell right here."
"5253430","5255570"," At 10 53 20. "
"5255990","5257770"," That's probably where the pin strike was."
"5258570","5260690"," But this is not this is capitulation."
"5261450","5264130"," This is not like sellers entering the market. "
"5264610","5268350"," When you start to see the by the confluence of buyers and sellers here."
"5268710","5272370"," You are seeing sellers being being absorbed."
"5274920","5278840"," I guess slightly more sellers at the moment on the spy, but this doesn't. "
"5278980","5280100"," It's noise to me."
"5280980","5283820"," If you guys are looking for a zone to buy."
"5283820","5286580"," You will start to see down here at 465. "

"5303160","5306820"," You'll see this turn into really thick blue at some point. "
"5307620","5310040"," That would mean that the sellers have been exhausted."
"5310040","5315500"," And then this will be a new major support for the spy looking for 470."

"6139040","6142060"," You got a little sneaky Pete coming in at 10 15 over here."
"6142120","6143020"," That's nothing."
"6143600","6144500"," That's nothing. "
"6144700","6147320"," You guys just absorbed a bunch of shorts."
"6147900","6148980"," A whole bunch."
"6149240","6151000"," You've turned them into a bull army. "

"6204640","6211640"," Okay, so you see, I want the one guy that's asking about oracle."
"6213060","6214060"," It's looking like oracle. "
"6214200","6216600"," So oracle is just noise right now."
"6216720","6222940"," It looks like if you're day trading oracle right now, you're at critical support at 90 between 90 "
"6222940","6224160",".65 and 90."
"6224660","6227340"," You've got more buyers set up below it 86. "
"6228340","6234060"," But this, when I scroll out like this, you can see that it's noise."
"6234740","6237920"," So you could buy a spread here between here and 85."
"6238480","6242640"," And then you're looking for a price target on oracle of 110 over time. "
"6242940","6243000"," Okay."
"6243780","6245440"," We're going to switch to the."
"6247340","6248600"," We're going to switch to spies. "
"6248940","6251060"," I know some of you guys are locked into spy right now."
"6255890","6258810"," Face melter mat face melter, my brother."
"6259910","6261250"," How do you like them apples?"
"6261530","6266270"," So you can see here on the spy face melter mat. "
"6266570","6269210"," Start to see we've got some support now at 10 10."
"6269830","6270290"," Right?"
"6270450","6273250"," It's hard to break through 10 10 on the Tesla feed."
"6274450","6278590"," If you've now created some support at 10 10 10 11. "
"6280030","6280730"," Excuse me."
"6280930","6282930"," And you're, you're looking to break through 10 15."
"6283910","6288670"," You've got some resistance setting up here on test. "
"6289050","6289670"," Excuse me."
"6291750","6293130"," We'll dehydrate it this morning."
"6295710","6296710"," He declared my throat. "
"6298230","6299450"," So it's cool rap song."
"6301410","6306620"," Let's look at, let's look at the spy real quick."
"6306920","6309440"," Yeah, you've just got, you've got sellers just being absorbed here. "
"6309820","6313140"," Whenever you see these yellow red lines here, you see these yellow red lines here."
"6313540","6314620"," It's the same story."
"6315500","6318240"," Tesla is just going to grind through this level. "
"6318600","6319920"," That's all that's happening right now."
"6320340","6322860"," You're grinding through to all time highs."
"6323360","6324340"," Nothing has changed. "
"6325340","6326520"," All sellers are being absorbed."
"6326880","6329020"," You got more sellers than in buyers right now."
"6329100","6333460"," But that's only because we are in because of how close these, these lines are. "
"6333600","6334860"," This is just support."
"6335280","6336120"," This is your resistance."
"6336420","6338800"," And you're got, you've got grinding going on. "
"6338920","6339060"," Okay."
"6339240","6341640"," We're going to try grind through this for 66."
"6341640","6343180"," This is a bullish. "

"6347000","6347440"," All right."
"6347980","6348780"," And then Tesla. "
"6350280","6353140"," You're going to have some consolidation around here at 10 10."
"6353480","6361880"," There's right now you've got support down here at 10.05. And you've got nothing up your above your"
"6361880","6363900"," above target right now is 10 20."
"6364340","6366940"," And you've got more bears heading up this 10 25. "
"6366940","6372280"," If you guys have been on this stream since this morning, you've seen the shift from nine 40"
"6372280","6374600"," straight up to over a thousand."
"6374780","6374960"," Okay."
"6375420","6377140"," That's a 60 or 70 point stretch. "
"6377680","6378660"," Or move."
"6378980","6379780"," It's a baller move."
"6381700","6382620"," Yeah, Matt. "

"6404760","6409100"," them into mid January in case we don't squeeze until mid January. "
"6409560","6410820"," I'm starting to get a little concerned."
"6411180","6413160"," I'm in the back of my mind, brother."

"6476210","6477290"," They're not regular puts."
"6477570","6478070"," They're hedges."
"6478410","6481090"," They were short dated hedges to the end of the month on IWM. "
"6482010","6484090"," And they're going to try to pin it until the end of the month."
"6488640","6489560"," Spies coming up."
"6489700","6489800"," Nope. "
"6490520","6490780"," Nope."
"6491240","6493780"," I am all bullish on spy right now for me."
"6494040","6495420"," I'm all bullish right now and spy. "
"6495720","6496400"," We're grinding along."
"6496660","6497440"," I'll show you right now."
"6497820","6501200"," And you can see right now you see right now on Tesla, right?"
"6501740","6503480"," We're building consolidation here. "
"6503480","6506620"," We've got a nice decent support down here at 10,000."
"6506900","6510480"," You can see that you've got new buyers stepping in at 1,000."
"6510800","6512500"," They're like, let's push this higher. "
"6512940","6516680"," You can see above that we've got a small wall at 10, 15, but this is tiny."
"6517320","6518740"," You got to remember we're dealing with Tesla."
"6519060","6520720"," And this is a small wall at 10, 20. "
"6520880","6526360"," Also, if you were here earlier this morning, this wall was at 1,000 and it was massive."
"6526840","6528120"," It was a massive wall."
"6528420","6531580"," And now you've turned shorts on to becoming bulls. "
"6531580","6535240"," If you come like zombies, if you make the money back and they're now going to want to make this"
"6535240","6539420"," run up and not at least break even if not take profit for the day."
"6539820","6542400"," They know now that it's a bullish context for the day on Tesla."
"6543040","6544080"," So just be aware of that. "
"6544420","6547080"," When you guys are looking at the spy, right?"
"6548360","6549780"," I'm going to show you guys something."
"6550020","6550180"," Okay."
"6550760","6554460"," If you had seen this, see this red red line down here. "
"6554500","6560980"," If this red line was down here at 465 or even lower, then you would say that's where the smart"
"6560980","6561500"," money is."
"6561580","6563580"," But the smart money is grinding through."
"6563640","6564300"," This isn't retail. "
"6564480","6567840"," These are banks right now that are absorbing our sellers."
"6568280","6570400"," So they can take this up for a ripper to 470."
"6571140","6576540"," But this happening today, it leads me to believe that we will make all time highs and possibly even"
"6576540","6576840"," higher. "
"6580830","6581290"," All right."
"6581990","6583310"," So this is where we're at."
"6583310","6583550"," Okay. "
"6584310","6585790"," I use DX feed."
"6585790","6590230"," I use live DX feed for my cash market."
"6590770","6593210"," And then I use, I forget the name of the one that I use for futures. "
"6594210","6598850"," And then I use BTC for Bitcoin."
"6599250","6600470"," Some other feed for Bitcoin."
"6600690","6601190"," I forget what it is. "
"6603290","6604890"," Hey, excuse me."
"6605370","6606090"," Hey, thanks, Ben."
"6606350","6607150"," I appreciate the donation. "
"6608350","6610010"," Thank you, Philip, for the donation in the mail."
"6610890","6612190"," You've got my address, my brother."
"6614030","6617110"," Yeah, the classes will be cool. "
"6617730","6618690"," Andre, good morning."
"6618890","6620510"," I hope you're happy with everything so far."
"6621210","6622070"," Good morning, Samuel. "
"6625800","6627240"," Crushing blood bath last few months."
"6627620","6630420"," Matt, I'm telling you, Matt, I watched that hedge come through."
"6630600","6631600"," It was a short dated hedge. "
"6632240","6633960"," It was utter complete bullshit, man."
"6634840","6636280"," It was, it was a, it was a pin."
"6637660","6638640"," I love you, Adam. "
"6638860","6639320"," Thank you, brother."
"6639700","6640940"," I appreciate the support."
"6642080","6644380"," Hope you guys are all making bank this morning. "
"6646670","6648070"," Hell, yeah, Adam."
"6648690","6650970"," Hell, yeah, 392 in the money."
"6653510","6654290"," Oh, invest. "
"6654550","6658610"," Once we're three, four, 66 minutes, it's, it's basically clear skies."
"6659850","6662650"," There's, there's, there's that wall was pretty big."
"6662650","6663570"," That wall it was yesterday. "
"6663850","6668170"," The wall was at 470 and they dropped that wall down right into 466."
"6668910","6674770"," So all that's those sellers that were above concentrated this morning as one last attempt to drop"
"6674770","6676170"," the market or resist the market."
"6676170","6678750"," And the market's just showing you that it's going up. "
"6683740","6686240"," Oh, Joe, I'm going to send it right now."
"6686600","6688520"," I'm going to get off live stream and I'm going to give you a call."
"6691720","6692780"," I love all you guys. "
"6693180","6695320"," Every single, dude, you got, you guys don't understand that."
"6695400","6698840"," I was, when I first became a trainer, I made so, had so many pitfalls."
"6699220","6699740"," I made mistakes. "
"6700660","6704020"," And I paid all these people like charlatans and crap out there."
"6704660","6708040"," And then I, I was losing, I like blew up accounts after accounts after accounts."
"6709520","6711740"," Oh, did I over complicated on my trading?"
"6712620","6716500"," And when you start to simplify your trading, it makes life so much easier. "
"6716900","6718300"," So much easier."
"6721960","6723000"," Thank you very much."
"6723220","6723600"," G Chen. "
"6723960","6724960"," I appreciate the support."
"6725760","6727240"," Thanks, Charles, for the support."
"6729920","6730820"," Oh, yeah, dude. "
"6731240","6731820"," I was a bear."
"6732480","6733060"," I went down there."
"6733480","6735440"," I lost so much money one year as a bear. "
"6736460","6741160"," I switched bear, but overall, like 70% of the time you should be bullish."
"6741780","6742200"," 70%."
"6743120","6750200"," And then you should either learn how to step back as a bull or be able to switch to bear"
"6750200","6751320"," for 30% of the time. "
"6754220","6755340"," Yeah, Tesla, baby."
"6757560","6758840"," Hope everybody's happy today."
"6759080","6760440"," Happy holidays to all of you. "
"6760600","6764760"," If you don't celebrate, I hope that you're able to at least be around some friends and family or"
"6764760","6765280"," read a book."
"6765540","6766100"," Take a hike."
"6766680","6766980"," Go skiing. "
"6770300","6771280"," I love all you guys."
"6771520","6773040"," I owe you guys."
"6773040","6780160"," I remember when I remember, dude, I remember when I was coming up and my mentors, you know, all I"
"6780160","6785660"," wanted to do was hug them because there was such a, there was, there was a sea of noise, like"
"6785660","6789540"," a literal cacophony of noise out there as a trader. "
"6790120","6794060"," And you go down the wrong rabbit hole, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed, doomed."
"6796180","6797780"," And so I don't know."
"6798040","6799540"," I want to see more retail traders. "
"6800160","6802020"," And you're going to see more retail traders over the years."
"6802020","6804920"," Don't be listening to people telling you the market's going to get too hard."
"6806120","6807660"," Retail traders are going to go away. "
"6807800","6814240"," That's all a mouthpiece by very snarky people, angry people, people that work for banks and hedge"
"6814240","6817660"," funds, pro traders that have an ego."
"6818380","6819780"," There's no need to have that shit."
"6820820","6821400"," No need. "
"6821580","6822860"," You guys aren't stealing from each other."
"6823460","6825040"," You guys are stealing from the banks."
"6826060","6826800"," Remember that. "
"6827260","6831020"," You guys aren't taking, you're not taking some other retail traders money."
"6831020","6832640"," You're taking the banks money."
"6832940","6834040"," Banks have a lot of money. "
"6834700","6837280"," It's like, it's like a transfer of wealth, right?"
"6838760","6839380"," I'm sorry."
"6839660","6843320"," It's greatest transfer of wealth in, in history is going on right now."
"6844020","6847940"," And you know, if you're not going to get, if you're not going to get it traditionally investing in"
"6847940","6855540"," a, in a, in a, in a 401k or a pension or anything like that, then you're, you're being forced"
"6855540","6858780"," to go on your own, to make your own future, right?"
"6858900","6859740"," To make your own retirement. "
"6861660","6868160"," So, you know, no, you, you can't, I don't know what to say about that other than that."
"6868160","6872220"," If you're being forced out there to make your own retirement, then, and you're all in the markets"
"6872220","6879360"," today, controlling your own destinies, I don't know why, why retail would turn on each other or"
"6879360","6882400"," close doors on new retail investors."
"6882400","6886860"," The more retail investors you have, the more power read the retail investors have. "
"6888320","6894940"," I don't think it's right now, but I think in 10, 20 years retail, if they could focus their energy,"
"6894960","6898000"," could be a force to reckon with like any of the big banks."
"6902280","6902760"," Yeah."
"6908380","6908960"," Thanks, Henry. "
"6909180","6909900"," I appreciate that."
"6919080","6919980"," Yeah, exactly."
"6920300","6920700"," Free trading. "
"6921700","6922940"," Yeah, it's all greed, man."
"6923120","6929080"," You've got, you guys, you guys, like, you guys have to understand to an extent that at some point"
"6929080","6934920"," retail has to come together and at least get a massive, or at least have like 70% think this"
"6934920","6938200"," and 30% think that and have it and know that it's a trusted source."
"6938940","6944800"," You know, like at some point, if they were ever able to do something like that and make retail"
"6944800","6946660"," powerful, it would move markets. "
"6947360","6952360"," It would, you know, that whole short argument, I'm down with shorting company that deserves to be"
"6952360","6957960"," shorted, but when you guys start to see the lid being lifted on some of these short operations,"
"6958160","6958660"," it's disgusting."
"6959260","6959900"," It really is."
"6960380","6966080"," You're killing companies out there that are good companies because they've got, you know, like low "
"6966080","6970240","-vote stocks, they've only got so many shares available to be shorted. "
"6970760","6973720"," It's kind of disgusting, especially on a small cap scale."
"6974300","6978000"," When you see some of these companies are small caps that are, let's talk about GME and AMC."
"6978000","6984120"," I'm talking about, you know, like just like six people in that company and they're getting crushed"
"6984120","6986060"," by some, some stupid hedge fund. "
"6986060","6987280"," The shit bothers me."
"6988980","6990200"," Where's the vol trigger at?"
"6990940","6992400"," You guys can check out."
"6992840","6994160"," Let me take a look at my vol trigger. "
"6994520","6995220"," Oh, I don't have it."
"6995220","6996240"," Do I have it up here?"
"6997760","6999040"," Okay, bring up trade and view."
"7001950","7003550"," Let's look at vol trigger on spy. "
"7005890","7006710"," Let's take a look."
"7009990","7012850"," Vol trigger was at 4,700 yesterday."
"7016180","7019280"," And there is not, or we've got one at four seven where we got one. "
"7019380","7019600"," Hold on."
"7020900","7027160"," You've got a vol trigger, a new vol trigger at this morning at 468 and you've got a real massive"
"7027160","7027760"," one at 470."
"7028640","7032260"," Now this disappeared this morning at 468 and 470. "
"7033980","7038780"," Contextually with what's taking place in the spy right now, I'm going to tell you that these are"
"7038780","7038980"," weak."
"7039200","7039800"," These are weak."
"7040540","7042800"," These aren't nearly as strong as they should be. "
"7043860","7045630"," And your next wall, hold on."
"7045630","7052630"," Your next wall on the spy, you've got clear skies above."
"7053170","7055910"," This all to me looks like it's just going to be stumbling back. "
"7056090","7058930"," You're going to see some light resistance at four."
"7059930","7062710"," You'll see light resistance at 468, 470."
"7063570","7069070"," You'll see some profit taking at 470 and then you'll see a bounce back at 460 for a move to"
"7069070","7069630"," 478. "
"7070470","7075410"," I think I talk about all this inside of the video last night and I think most of it's come"
"7075410","7077070"," true on a faster timeline."
"7085020","7086320"," Yeah, I know all about it."
"7086520","7087840"," You guys, I know all about this stuff. "
"7089440","7094600"," Tom, Tom, Tom, Motley Fool said, test is the greatest redistribution of wealth from institutional"
"7095040","7095820"," individuals, aka retail."
"7096100","7096220"," Yep."
"7098240","7099560"," Hope you guys are all making money. "
"7099840","7103360"," See another wall being built above here."
"7103360","7105440"," So you're looking for 468, 470."
"7106680","7112060"," If you're looking for a dip to buy in the spy, let's say you've just been watching all day long,"
"7112060","7115610"," maybe hope and pray. "
"7120450","7124810"," Maybe hope and pray that you get a chance to buy at 465."
"7130490","7133510"," You know that smart money is in it for 50 right now."
"7135030","7137990"," And yeah, dude, all the buyers are right on 466. "
"7141010","7141950"," That's what it is."
"7142270","7143350"," We're in a bullish context."
"7146780","7155440"," So you've got some nice support being built down here at 999 on Tesla, 1000 on Tesla, you've got"
"7155440","7159300"," the some new resistance at 1015 and 1020. "
"7159620","7163700"," They're not big though, and we were consolidating and Tesla right now."
"7164200","7165820"," So you're still good to go."
"7166040","7169860"," The one thing I want to tell you though, as a trader, remember, right?"
"7170080","7171380"," We've got it's 1126. "
"7172360","7176940"," So start to think that traders are going to go out and take themselves as a nice lunch."
"7177840","7178040"," Right?"
"7178200","7182480"," They're probably going to take a take a break between sometimes it's like 1130 to 30 in the"
"7182480","7182860"," afternoon."
"7183460","7185600"," And you see that one more rip into the clothes. "
"7186560","7187020"," So you're going to."
"7187180","7190940"," So if you're a Tesla trader, take a little bit of profit, right?"
"7191500","7192600"," Wait for some consolidation."
"7194420","7198060"," And you're going to look for support at 1005. "
"7198880","7203740"," And you're going to look for a move up into that later part of the afternoon."
"7203840","7206260"," It could happen now, but take some profit."
"7206260","7208600"," I want you guys to take some profit, please. "
"7209420","7210420"," Please, please."
"7212380","7213840"," Let the house money run."
"7214080","7215140"," You take the money you put in. "
"7215520","7216500"," Take a little bit of profit."
"7217000","7218760"," You leave some on the table that you made."
"7219260","7220120"," That's house money. "
"7221040","7225100"," And then you put your tell yourself, Hey, I'm going to sell it 10,000 15 today."
"7225520","7227000"," I'm going to sell it 10,000 20."
"7227460","7231560"," And if we break below 10,000 five, I'm going to pull it all off the table. "
"7231920","7232160"," Okay."
"7232900","7234680"," You guys understand me when I'm talking?"
"7234940","7236280"," I'm going to tell you guys take profit."
"7241230","7243450"," Yeah, we're making a run at 10,000 15 again. "
"7243610","7243990"," We should hit."
"7244090","7244590"," We should hit."
"7245150","7246610"," It's not that we're not going to hit it. "
"7247190","7250870"," What I'm trying to tell you is that you take some profit."
"7251450","7252970"," You take profit at 10,000 15."
"7254910","7257110"," Leave some on the table for 10,000 15. "
"7258650","7260630"," Leave some on the table for 10,000 20."
"7262510","7266750"," And if you're trying to be a buyer in Tesla, you get down your knees and pray that we come"
"7266750","7268970"," back down to 10,000 five and 1,000."
"7268970","7271190"," But you know you've got buyers here. "
"7271310","7272010"," You see this right here?"
"7272410","7275650"," This is, this is support 10,000 five."
"7281700","7282640"," That's right, Joe."
"7283260","7283720"," Yes. "
"7288650","7290430"," Yeah, Henry, take a little bit off the table."
"7290570","7291090"," Just a little bit."
"7292510","7297910"," If you want to buy Tesla or jump in on Tesla 10,000 five is where support is. "
"7301520","7302140"," Take profit."
"7302500","7305380"," Like there's no, there's no reason not to take some profit."
"7306100","7308320"," If you want to leave some on leave some on. "
"7308320","7312340"," If you want to take all your profit, pay attention to Tesla today."
"7312420","7317100"," If you see a bounce off to 10,000 five, then you know that you can take it to 10 "
"7317100","7319080",",000 15 10,000 20."
"7319480","7321920"," You want to see where the big wall is on Tesla right now?"
"7322740","7323900"," If there's a big wall?"
"7326090","7328730"," Yeah, see these, these shorts never learn. "
"7329450","7331050"," These shorts never learn."
"7331530","7332850"," So here's your next point."
"7334050","7336290"," 10,000 50 is the big wall now. "
"7336670","7337530"," You guys want to see that?"
"7338970","7341730"," So let's say you bounce off 10,000 five."
"7342190","7349290"," Your next price target is 10 50 10 50."
"7350270","7351810"," You got to see this right now. "
"7352310","7353910"," So this is a great setup."
"7354570","7358710"," You've got major support at Tesla at 10,000 five."
"7358970","7360390"," That's also your stop loss. "
"7360930","7362550"," So when you're like, when do I get out of Tesla?"
"7363110","7367890"," Well, if you break through 10,000 five or 10,000, that's where you put your stop losses."
"7367890","7369550"," But what does this set up to be?"
"7370250","7377410"," This whole right here is a set up to break through 10,000 15 10,000 20 for a squeeze"
"7377410","7378550"," to 10 50."
"7378990","7380590"," That's what you tell your friends on Twitter. "
"7381390","7383050"," You've got a base of 10,000 five."
"7383490","7386230"," We're trying to break through right now to get to 10,000 50."
"7388840","7392260"," You did call it didn't you drink tell in a day 10 50. "
"7395770","7397390"," I'm just in the wrong ticker."
"7398770","7400050"," I've done that."
"7400610","7402910"," Sometimes they'll be in the wrong ticker and that end of day. "
"7403030","7404190"," I'm like in a day."
"7404290","7407750"," I'm like, wait a minute, which ticker went up a hundred points today?"
"7411830","7414630"," Which ticker went up 15% today?"
"7415730","7416810"," I've done that, Adam."
"7420200","7420920"," Yes, sir. "
"7421180","7422520"," Always on directional moves."
"7422620","7423720"," Take profit on zero dates."
"7424140","7426280"," So here's your setup for the diversity today. "
"7427540","7429280"," Buyer at 10,000 five now."
"7429520","7430680"," Then a seller at 10 50."
"7431560","7435520"," You're going to wait for a grind through 10 10 15s and 10 20. "
"7435520","7439780"," If you really wanted to be a safe trainer today, you'd wait for a move above 10 20."
"7440200","7443080"," And then just take that rip between 10 20 and 10 50."
"7446810","7447810"," Guys, getting all this. "
"7448550","7450550"," All right, I'm going to start logging off here."
"7450650","7450810"," Okay."
"7451610","7453210"," So I'm going to leave you with this. "
"7453990","7456410"," You have support at 10 oh five to 10."
"7457570","7459530"," Or like 1000 to 1000 five."
"7460170","7461090"," That's where your support is. "
"7461190","7464950"," If you break below those numbers, you're going to pull the rip quarter of your profit."
"7465770","7471410"," You are looking for consolidation between 10 oh five and 10 20."
"7471910","7474750"," If we break through 10 20, we're going to 10 50. "
"7475170","7476390"," You guys understand that?"
"7476770","7479410"," So if you're like, well, I'm going to take profit off table."
"7479410","7481750"," Maybe I'll wait until we break above 10 20."
"7482250","7483650"," And then I'll take it to 10 50. "
"7484130","7488050"," If you're a long time holder, that's what you're looking for."
"7488270","7489670"," This is all pretty simple."
"7489870","7492850"," And you guys are seeing another wall coming in down below at 1000. "
"7492850","7493990"," This is good."
"7494450","7495990"," This is major support being."
"7496270","7497110"," This is support. "

"7503930","7505950"," Big, big, big support wall. "
"7506730","7509510"," At the 1000 to 1000 five level."
"7509750","7513910"," This means that you're getting getting another gear up and you see these been nice big green"
"7513910","7514270"," bubbles."
"7514610","7518110"," You're getting a big gear up right now to just burn these shorts. "
"7518110","7521690"," 10,000 or 1,000 15 and 1,000 20."
"7522050","7524870"," And they are going to make an attempt for 10,000 50."
"7526210","7527190"," You're welcome everybody. "
"7531120","7532260"," Congratulations, Joe."
"7533520","7534380"," Anytime Andy."
"7537820","7539480"," Hope you guys are stoked out there. "
"7539920","7541320"," Hope you guys are making bank out there."
"7541680","7543040"," You guys start making a bank."
"7543300","7546380"," If you guys start winning 60% of your trades, you're, you're. "
"7546520","7548260"," You're compared to baseball."
"7548880","7552400"," If you win 60 to 70% of your trades, that's it."
"7552400","7554920"," You don't even need 90 just 60 to 70. "
"7555320","7558060"," You're batting like a 300 350 in baseball."
"7559580","7560600"," You're a Hall of Famer."
"7562930","7564190"," Literally Hall of Famer. "
"7571740","7574880"," Well, I heard a lot of shit talking on, on Twitter this morning."
"7581000","7581500"," Anytime."
"7584140","7589840"," You guys see my Tesla post this morning at four a.m. I'm up there with my, my blackboard. "
"7589980","7590820"," My hair is all crazy."
"7590880","7593440"," They got like connected dots across the blackboard."
"7594600","7595640"," That's all of you. "
"7597240","7598540"," Yeah, I'll take a look at TSM."
"7599820","7601000"," Let's take a look at TSM."
"7604220","7607360"," And you see this firming up for you spy people out there. "
"7609430","7611670"," Starting to see some resistance at four 70."
"7611870","7613470"," This implies a move to four 70."
"7617650","7620870"," That also implies a move that is going to go to 10 50. "
"7622190","7622230"," Right."
"7622390","7624470"," You start to correlate stocks to indexes."
"7626530","7633690"," So I would say that you've got a high, a high chance of seeing 10, 50 today in Tesla. "
"7641500","7642780"," Take a look at TSM."
"7646040","7647560"," You know, start looking at the VIX."
"7647820","7648520"," Start looking at Tesla. "
"7648840","7650800"," Start looking at NDX at Nasdaq."
"7651340","7653760"," Look at the spy piece it all together."
"7655000","7657200"," And it should give you the pieces of the puzzle. "
"7657980","7660160"," You want to look that you're seeing that shorts are being."
"7661120","7662360"," Shorts are being consumed."
"7662720","7665020"," They're now bulls to an extent. "
"7665720","7665940"," They're bulls."
"7672830","7675110"," You've got some grind going on here at one 20."
"7675110","7679510"," You know that the buyers all the smart buyers right now 110 on TSM. "
"7680030","7680390"," Okay."
"7681010","7686190"," You got to look for a bounce below if you're going to be a safe buyer for a move up."
"7686250","7688290"," You've got some resistance forming at 125. "
"7688430","7690250"," You have capitulation by sellers."
"7691090","7694830"," You've got clear skies above clear skies above and TSM."
"7696030","7702490"," And you've got way more buyers and sellers way more. "
"7703450","7707770"," If you're trading TSM today, I'll leave you with this."
"7708010","7710350"," If you haven't entered TSM, you could join the fray."
"7711470","7712550"," But smart buyers at 110. "
"7714090","7719790"," The overwhelming buying that's going on in TSM leaves me to believe that we will break through 125."
"7720870","7728280"," You will probably see another spike above to 140 at some point today."
"7734650","7735150"," No. "
"7735350","7739870"," So, so I have not my, so my setup is still not complete for me."
"7739930","7740530"," Matter of fact."
"7742010","7742850"," Inside here. "
"7746590","7749990"," Oh, they're just not giving up on the, they're not giving up on these spy calls."
"7752260","7754340"," These market makers are assholes."
"7770140","7778780"," So I cannot trade and so I cannot trade on what this other computer I have and the one that"
"7778780","7779480"," I'm on over here. "
"7779500","7782620"," I can't live trade on this setup just yet."
"7783320","7784820"," How I have it set up right now."
"7785800","7793180"," I can't live trade and not be looking at a candlestick chart at the same time. "
"7793180","7795240"," I'm looking at book map and trading."
"7795660","7799060"," So I'm setting up an office right now so that I can do it all at the same time."
"7799700","7802340"," So right now I've got one hand behind my back. "
"7803520","7804500"," On my end."
"7807840","7809380"," Let's go back to Tesla for you."
"7818930","7820170"," Take a look here. "
"7830620","7834340"," So you got to see, so you got to see what I talked to you about just a few minutes"
"7834340","7834520"," ago."
"7834520","7835400"," I said to you."
"7835580","7838480"," You're looking for 10,000 five to hold here. "
"7838680","7839180"," Right."
"7840140","7846760"," And you want to see the consolidation here for the next move up 10 15 10 20 eventually 10 50."
"7847620","7850120"," If you see 10,000 five break. "
"7852200","7856080"," If you see 10,000 five break, that would be a hint."
"7858980","7861180"," Something you've you've ever heard of a fishing expedition."
"7862160","7865600"," You might see Tesla break below and bounce off 1000. "
"7866480","7873620"," I was talking to you about 10,000 five to our excuse me 1000 five to 1000."
"7877090","7880410"," You see buyers moving up to this 1000 mark right here."
"7881670","7887550"," Sometimes you'll see a quick dip below and someone will grab a nice fat call right at 1000. "
"7890000","7891860"," I would put my stops at 1000."
"7892540","7895880"," If you want it to be really concerned, you can put on 1005 but sometimes you'll get."
"7896440","7900240"," You'll get triggered on your stop at 1005 and it's only for a brief moment. "
"7903390","7905310"," And it was to grab cheap shares at 1000."
"7911230","7912050"," Right on, Henry."
"7912770","7914190"," Yeah, I need to do that, don't I?"
"7914850","7919730"," Henry, can you do you mind DMing me if you're on Twitter, can you DM me. "
"7920430","7922050"," That AMD thread rep or CPU."
"7922930","7924190"," So I can take a look at it."
"7931670","7934250"," Does it add some strength right because some of 50 ma. "
"7935110","7941450"," I think yes, and so I do use sometimes I'll use the moving averages to confirm where we're at or"
"7941450","7942590"," deny where we're at or whatever."
"7947300","7948380"," But so right."
"7948580","7949840"," It's hard to explain. "
"7950280","7952880"," So when I'm doing my research, yeah, I'll use all those indicators."
"7953400","7956640"," But then once I get into the day and I'm like, Hey, this is my plan."
"7956760","7958200"," This is what I'm looking for to happen. "
"7958200","7965060"," The real truth beats everything out there is is what's happening live with order flow."
"7966420","7971740"," What's happening live with with the sellers and the buyers and what they're thinking, right?"
"7972280","7977580"," So at the end of the day, after all the bullshit's put to the side, I'm looking for the actual"
"7977580","7979500"," what's actually taking place."
"7981320","7983840"," How many times do 50, 50 ma's fail?"
"7984400","7988020"," How many times do 100 days fail or seven day moving averages?"
"7988420","7993200"," You see them fail and you see people say, well, I did all this research and I did all this"
"7993200","7995060"," stuff and it still didn't work. "
"7995120","7996540"," What am I doing wrong here?"
"7997340","8000760"," I must have missed something and it's because you don't have that last piece."
"8000920","8006400"," You want that last piece of knowing what the actual order flow is."
"8006400","8009420"," The buyers show up or to the seller show up. "
"8012810","8013510"," Thanks, Henry."
"8013670","8014250"," I appreciate it."
"8016200","8016640"," Yeah, Matt. "
"8016820","8017920"," You can just pause the video."
"8017940","8019960"," Go straight back a minute or two, five minutes."
"8020340","8030340"," You'll see the technicals on the order flow for TSM and where it is potentially"
"8030340","8030880"," going. "
"8035770","8041030"," And then you reset your connection and you'll be live with me once again."
"8046760","8047380"," All right."
"8047380","8048520"," So here's the deal. "
"8048640","8048760"," Okay."
"8048860","8049800"," You guys got it from me."
"8049900","8050540"," I have to take a break. "
"8050800","8051060"," I want to."
"8051140","8054560"," I need to do my own trades out there every time I do these live streams."
"8054580","8055720"," I'm not able to trade at the moment. "
"8056000","8060860"," I should have my my normal station set up here for live."
"8061140","8066440"," I have to do the live streaming while I'm trading and I can't cut because what I'm doing right now"
"8066440","8071800"," is I'm looking at a bunch of screens and interacting with you constantly, but that's not really a"
"8071800","8072080"," problem."
"8072080","8077360"," The problem is that I don't have a screen for me to watch the candlesticks in conjunction with the"
"8077360","8081480"," flow and my training broke my brokerages. "
"8082160","8084820"," So right now I'm like, just kind of got my trades in the background."
"8088400","8089900"," So I'm kind of pissing at myself."
"8090240","8090980"," Actually, not you guys. "
"8096330","8098610"," What are debit call spreads?"
"8099250","8099370"," Okay."
"8099590","8102250"," One thing about debit call spreads and I want to leave you guys with."
"8102510","8102550"," Okay. "
"8103830","8108790"," I I love taking profit on debit call spreads near 50%."
"8108790","8112930"," So it's unless you're upside down and waiting for it to print at the end."
"8113830","8116510"," If you're making up to 40, 50% of debit call spread. "
"8117990","8123290"," It's sometimes better for you to take it at 50 because the rest of the time when you're going to"
"8123290","8124650"," make the other 50%."
"8124650","8131610"," Is usually too far out in time that you could put in all your profit on them."
"8131670","8132510"," I'm not explaining this good. "
"8132770","8134090"," So let me start at the beginning."
"8134930","8140370"," If you put if you pick the right direction when you open a spread and it automatically prints you"
"8140370","8141110"," 50%."
"8141110","8145730"," Typically it won't print the last 50% until the spread expires. "
"8146490","8150170"," Let's say I buy a month spread and I make 50% in the first week."
"8150970","8151310"," Right."
"8151870","8156750"," I won't print the 50 the next 50% typically until near expiration. "
"8158230","8163430"," So why would I wait three weeks for that expiration when I could put that money to work somewhere"
"8163430","8163830"," else."
"8165050","8166190"," I hope that makes sense."
"8166970","8171110"," Now, if you go upside down in a spread and you're like, well, I've already lost all my investment"
"8171110","8171510"," in that. "
"8171830","8176170"," Yeah, then you hold it into the contract expiration."
"8177090","8181350"," One other note in this is don't ever ever any spread."
"8182330","8185790"," Never ever let them get closed after hours. "
"8186550","8189850"," Especially on indexes always be there's a few rules."
"8190070","8191350"," You need to know what spreads number one."
"8192650","8200309"," Always better to take spreads out on cash settled stocks or indexes, i.e. spreads are safer on the"
"8200309","8207570"," spy on the IWM on the cues when you are upside down or too far up. "
"8208389","8218270"," On a spread in on a stock settled stock right and specifically on a dividend bearing"
"8218270","8218770"," stock."
"8219030","8224750"," There's big danger that you can your your your legs on your spreads can be."
"8226389","8232530"," Can be executed while you have while you're holding that spread and it's this I'll explain better"
"8232530","8233010"," later. "
"8233910","8238070"," My mind I have to think about how to ward this to you guys but what will happen is though"
"8238070","8244230"," close one end of your spread tell you that you owe them a million dollars and you just have to"
"8244230","8247209"," make sure that you close before the end of the day the other leg of the spread."
"8248610","8254150"," So you can cover the difference so you don't get screwed and you can get screwed on spreads so"
"8254150","8262010"," remember try to put your spreads on trying to put your spreads on cash settling no dividend ETFs."
"8262830","8268410"," If you are going to take a spread on an individual ticker if you start if you see the stock"
"8268410","8272850"," going way way above where you're in the money you close those things out. "
"8273129","8278950"," Never ever let a spread execute after hours there's a lot of funny business that goes on and after"
"8278950","8283309"," hours intentionally to screw spread holders."
"8283309","8290309"," I need to do a video on that because you guys can look you got people get panicky."
"8292940","8295160"," Yeah getting a sign on executed thank you assignments. "
"8295440","8297360"," I'm using the wrong the wrong words."
"8300500","8301520"," Yeah free money."
"8305379","8310840"," Did Elon sell some no no we just talked about hitting 10.05. This is normal like you're going to"
"8310840","8311920"," you need to be looking for. "
"8311920","8315100"," We're heading into the lunch hour."

"8318580","8322440"," You want to make sure that we're going to settle down here at 10,000 5 10,000. "
"8322780","8325900"," You see a nice support building down here below now at 1000."
"8326360","8327540"," We should settle down here."
"8327680","8335100"," I wouldn't surprise me to see some form of rip higher into clothes at 10 20 10 15 10 20"
"8335100","8336260"," possibly 10 50. "
"8340209","8344150"," Yeah, you're like you don't want to get assigned and if you can assign a one leg and not the"
"8344150","8344330"," other."
"8344510","8348990"," It's going to look like you all you all your brokerage that's stupid amount of money to start"
"8348990","8349430"," panicking."
"8349809","8352129"," You'll see weird shit dealers and market makers. "
"8352209","8359090"," They run scams after hours to screw over spread holders butterfly condor holders."
"8359530","8364889"," If you start to see one side of your field like condors or butterflies and one side's getting way"
"8364889","8365950"," way way outside the money."
"8365950","8368410"," You cut the other side or you cut that other side loose. "
"8368889","8374250"," So you don't get assigned the safest way to trade any kind of complex trading strategy."
"8374670","8377290"," Everyone knows is on cash."
"8378690","8381790"," Cash settlements ETFs safest. "
"8386870","8392810"," They can just so you know they can definitely they can definitely."
"8393930","8395770"," Exhters they can definitely assign you."
"8396010","8398710"," I've seen guys I've been trading a long time. "
"8398710","8401750"," I've seen guys get straight jacked in the after hours."
"8402230","8403950"," I'm talking about like the four 15."
"8405570","8406630"," It will happen. "
"8406810","8413250"," Another thing another funky thing that happens is they have to they have these like they have a buy"
"8413250","8418310"," our MOC and the sell orders like for spying and selling in the after hours."
"8418310","8424950"," And you will see like an order come through before the four 15 hour but it doesn't get processed in"
"8424950","8427770"," the air quotes until after four 15 PM."
"8429130","8434850"," And so they're not processing everything and you will see it take place like four or five o'clock"
"8434850","8435630"," six o'clock. "
"8435750","8439790"," Those are little unknown gray areas in the markets where you get screwed."
"8445050","8445790"," They can."
"8446810","8448290"," Yeah, you can't do the same. "
"8448390","8448550"," Sorry."
"8448710","8450270"," I misread what you wrote blood sons."
"8450810","8456670"," They can do it and people don't realize there's a gray area where you can get straight screwed in"
"8456670","8457270"," the after hours. "
"8457490","8459750"," So whether I'm making or losing money."
"8459750","8461690"," Let's say I hold a spread any spread."
"8461690","8464270"," Let's them hold it right up to the last day on that expiration day. "
"8464950","8468190"," I close always close my spreads before four PM."
"8469550","8475070"," Even if I'm losing even if we spike up at four 15 close my spreads at four o'clock."
"8475190","8476890"," I take it on the chin take the loss. "
"8477070","8477870"," Take the L."
"8481960","8482440"," Yep."
"8482820","8486580"," So if you guys are watching right here 10 oh five to 10 to 1000."
"8486920","8491220"," Remember what I said you've got your stop losses are between 10 oh five and 1000. "
"8499970","8504170"," 10 oh five to 1000 is your stop losses on Tesla today."
"8510860","8512700"," Cottage cob with what's cob."
"8513100","8513940"," I don't know what's cob. "
"8514480","8515280"," What did I say wrong."
"8515540","8516240"," But I must speak."
"8516800","8517680"," It's a bar off. "
"8519760","8520360"," We're off."
"8520440","8521000"," What do I need to know?"
"8521300","8521740"," More words."
"8521880","8522900"," I'm missing what you're saying. "
"8526790","8530770"," Thanks Henry for the update January 21st tessel 1100 calls."
"8531070","8533890"," Just hit the tape for 50 at 34 bucks."
"8534690","8536550"," For 1.5 million. "
"8536870","8539370"," There was your dip."
"8540090","8543070"," That said that earlier right I said you'll see a fishing expedition."
"8543070","8544430"," They'll dip it. "
"8544550","8545270"," Grab some calls."
"8546710","8548450"," You'll you'll sell out."
"8548610","8549990"," They'll get cheap shares. "

"8556950","8558150"," Rob you know what you're talking about."
"8558410","8558790"," Don't panic. "
"8562630","8563510"," And that's what Rob."
"8563690","8565830"," So Rob's talking about is what I was discussing earlier."
"8566010","8566890"," He's putting into better words. "
"8567370","8569950"," So if you see that swing that goes way too high."
"8570510","8571470"," His short short put."
"8571730","8576290"," His short put side was assigned because he went way way way way way outside the money. "
"8580790","8581270"," Yeah."
"8581370","8582710"," Rob knows exactly what I'm talking about."
"8584370","8585150"," Yeah, you don't panic. "
"8585150","8585890"," You sell the shares."
"8586490","8587470"," And that's the thing too though."
"8587630","8590110"," You know what people forget is they forget to sell the shares. "
"8590730","8592630"," Check their account the next day and they freak out."
"8595390","8595790"," Yep."
"8595990","8596690"," And resell the puts. "
"8597850","8601130"," To keep that sexy, sexy extrinsic value."
"8603190","8603990"," Free money."
"8604790","8604810"," Yeah. "
"8605050","8607790"," When you guys, some of you guys out there make a lot of money."
"8608210","8612030"," You know, you guys should know that the rich people, all they do is sell puts and sell calls."
"8612570","8613490"," They don't even trade. "
"8613490","8616710"," All they do is sell puts outside the money calls and puts all day long."
"8617270","8621910"," You have the implied move for a day, the week, the month, implied move for a quarter."
"8622690","8626230"," When you start hearing people saying like we expect the spy to do 14% in a year. "
"8626950","8630390"," All that stuff's tied into big money that are selling calls and puts."
"8633950","8634830"," I wish I was that rich."
"8635070","8636950"," You're talking like a hundred million dollars. "
"8637810","8639270"," A hundred million dollars."
"8639650","8641190"," You just sold calls and puts all day long."
"8641370","8642950"," You're just making free bank. "
"8644110","8645410"," Free money all day long."
"8648890","8649650"," Thanks for the upside."
"8650270","8652330"," The UVX wide looks like it just bottoms. "
"8655030","8655750"," It is."
"8655970","8656610"," I love that extra."
"8656730","8658270"," I love sucking that with that stride. "
"8658550","8659690"," Just put that stride in."
"8661290","8662030"," Let's look at."
"8662250","8665810"," I'm going to look on my candlestick chart and take a look at the VIX again. "
"8666490","8666690"," Yeah."
"8666990","8668190"," We should cool off here."
"8668410","8669250"," It wouldn't surprise me. "
"8669330","8669990"," People are going to take a lunch."
"8670030","8670790"," They're going to take profit."
"8671630","8672570"," We are bottoming. "
"8673070","8673570"," Henry's correct."
"8673850","8676470"," We are starting to curl up a little bit here in the VIX."
"8676470","8678950"," We wouldn't shock me to see people take some profit here. "
"8680230","8683990"," Sometimes they'll sneak us above when nobody's looking to eat lunch."
"8684650","8685090"," That's possible."
"8685370","8685730"," We do that. "
"8686010","8687170"," We could possibly break through."
"8688230","8690190"," Sometimes our biggest moves are."
"8690390","8690590"," Sorry. "
"8690690","8691830"," We were afraid of that."
"8692530","8693850"," Most days of the week."
"8695210","8695950"," You'll see that. "
"8696790","8698750"," That slow time between."
"8700010","8701970"," 11.32 in the afternoon."
"8701970","8707750"," And then move made up or down between three and four PM, right?"
"8709050","8710270"," Every blue moon. "
"8710930","8714010"," What they'll do is everybody's on lunch and they'll sneak."
"8714890","8717950"," The spy up way high or way down."
"8718870","8722250"," You'll be paying any attention and they'll pull a fast one on you. "
"8722590","8723970"," And those are usually big days."
"8725050","8726150"," Let's be conscious of that."
"8726370","8727730"," This all looks like it's just normal though. "
"8727870","8730590"," This all looks like, you know, take a lunch, take your profit."
"8731970","8734610"," Set yourself in the alarm and go have some lunch."
"8735270","8737530"," Come back and take a look at where we're at and where we're going. "
"8740970","8741490"," That's right."
"8741610","8742550"," I drink your milkshake."
"8742690","8743350"," I drink it up. "
"8744010","8750440"," I think it's still worth holding on to my 1231 for it."
"8750540","8751340"," I always like taking profit."
"8751540","8752440"," You guys can take profit. "
"8752960","8755460"," You know, if you guys miss a trade, it's okay to miss a trade."
"8756080","8761300"," You take profit on your trades and then you set for yourself where you're comfortable buying."
"8761300","8765860"," We'll look at Spy real quick because I'm being asked about it or being asked about. "
"8768410","8769750"," And subscribe from here."
"8770750","8775810"," We're going to talk about, you know, like you hit for 65, right?"
"8776250","8779030"," Any of you day traders know that once you hit your targets."
"8780390","8783410"," That they're going to grind the value out of your options. "
"8785130","8790830"," So this is the moment where the market makers come in and they suck in the."
"8790830","8795430"," The theta gang comes in and sucks your your profits."
"8796090","8798130"," They sneak in, right?"
"8798370","8800270"," And they literally take your profit away from you. "
"8800370","8805790"," So what I'll tend to tend to do unless they're very far out options is I'll."
"8806170","8809390"," If I'm day trading weeklies, I'm looking for price targets."
"8809390","8813590"," I'll take profit and then I'll step back in to trade the next run. "
"8814730","8816410"," So let's look at the spy feed."
"8824870","8828630"," And if you're looking for a place to buy the spy, let's say we started to consolidate here."
"8829050","8833070"," You're going to look to be rebying back in the spy right now at 4650. "
"8836630","8838430"," You're also going to be looking for."
"8842800","8845240"," You're going to be looking for support at 4650."
"8847640","8850440"," This is like a this is like an intraday support level 4650. "
"8851160","8855440"," You break below 4650 and you're going to be looking for where where do we know?"
"8855440","8860360"," Well, major support of the day is 460 461 462."
"8861780","8867360"," So an intraday support level you're looking for right now, 4655 on the spy."
"8868240","8869080"," You see this. "
"8869260","8870960"," Look at this wall forming above here."
"8871540","8873060"," Not a wall, but 46."
"8873860","8880540"," I would expect that by end of day, we tag 46 8.20. What's I'm going to expect out of"
"8880540","8881180"," the day?"
"8882620","8888900"," See these minor supports down here for an intraday minor sport 4650 4650. "
"8889980","8893860"," And then the price target right now is 4620 on the day."
"8894420","8895420"," It could go higher too."
"8896120","8898280"," I thought we saw it at 475. "
"8899440","8901720"," You got 471 472."
"8903160","8908640"," And you have some resistance now for see you start seeing stuff like this up here 480."
"8910460","8912320"," That wasn't there earlier this morning. "
"8912560","8913720"," So now they're taking that seriously."
"8914400","8916340"," You can see this forming up here 470."
"8917260","8921000"," Start seeing people are realizing that we could make 470 today. "
"8923550","8924510"," So what would you do?"
"8924710","8928910"," I don't know you take profit at 465 or where we are right now."
"8928910","8931630"," And then you let the grind do the work for you."
"8931650","8932670"," I always tell you guys, right?"
"8933430","8934430"," Take it to the resistance. "
"8935510","8937330"," Let the banks do the work for you."
"8937330","8940010"," Take the trade back up to 470 above."
"8940470","8942750"," And so you're looking for above four. "
"8943910","8944850"," Hold on here."
"8945510","8952670"," If we break above 466.59. You're going to look to pick up the spy again to 470."
"8956750","8957430"," Yeah, yeah. "

"8973490","8975370"," This is a big trade right now in energy. "
"8977970","8980390"," That's probably trying to print a trade that he took."
"8980830","8981570"," That Biden took."
"8981710","8985190"," I saw a ton of money going in last week into energy trades. "
"8985630","8986870"," They want to get a print I bet."
"8988110","8990130"," I bet Biden wants to print his calls."
"8990970","8994450"," He's turning into like a, you notice that Biden's turning into like a Trump?"
"8995450","8997650"," Like he's, he knows he has some flex on the markets. "
"8999790","9003710"," Like he's doing it in a really like a quiet, weird, weird way."
"9003710","9004670"," He never used to do that."
"9004830","9008630"," Now he's doing, he's like trying to, trying to play the markets right now. "
"9008870","9009590"," You guys noticed that?"

"9167230","9169630"," You couldn't even found them how much they actually have."
"9170570","9176190"," They've literally come back in all the liquidity that was put in the market by the QE and the QT."
"9176190","9177850"," All that money is in their pockets. "
"9178570","9179410"," They're taking it all back."
"9179630","9180850"," They're taking it back in taxes."
"9180990","9183210"," They're taking it back in fees on mortgages. "
"9183890","9187590"," There's so many slimy things that are being done to remove that liquidity from the market."
"9187950","9189450"," And it's not going back to the government."
"9189850","9193390"," It's going literally into the deep back vaults of the banks. "
"9198270","9199990"," You guys want me to bring up Apple real quick?"
"9201770","9202870"," Tell them you got the road."
"9203150","9205310"," Let me bring up the Apple real quick for you guys."
"9205830","9209030"," Let me bring up Apple. "
"9209110","9210190"," I know you guys got Apple too."
"9210910","9215980"," We'll do Apple real quick before I sign off here."
"9216380","9217580"," When we're done with Apple, I'm out. "
"9220120","9221820"," Let's see that nice Tesla feed."
"9222540","9223420"," Look at that gorgeous feed."
"9223920","9225260"," This is a prime setup. "
"9225800","9227680"," This is an amazing setup right here in Tesla."
"9228460","9229380"," It's a gangster setup."
"9230260","9230940"," Gangster setup. "
"9232580","9234240"," Let's look at Apple real quick."
"9239510","9241030"," We're going to talk about..."
"9242150","9244390"," Let's see if I can bring this down in a better level for you."
"9244390","9246310"," Give you guys some Apple levels. "
"9250010","9251010"," Hang tight here."
"9251230","9252470"," Let's take it a minute to load."
"9258800","9259820"," Come on Apple. "
"9261960","9263040"," You can do it Apple."
"9266140","9267100"," Hang tight here."
"9267240","9271920"," I'm having a little bit of a squeeze on my internet here. "
"9272920","9274460"," Let's see if I can load this one again."
"9277630","9279990"," Okay, here we go."
"9282390","9286670"," Let's spread this on a little bit. "
"9292350","9293850"," Apple is pumping."
"9294410","9295130"," Look at Apple."
"9297050","9298850"," Apple's going crazy right now. "
"9302600","9305280"," All right, this should help you guys in Apple land, right?"
"9308480","9309260"," Let's talk."
"9309540","9311300"," We've got support one at 150."
"9311740","9313100"," Support two, it's 160. "
"9313900","9316320"," Support three at 165, right?"
"9316960","9320920"," You've got major consolidation going on in Apple at 174."
"9323900","9325740"," Your R1 is 180."
"9326220","9327180"," R2 is 185. "
"9328420","9331280"," And this is Selvanues at 190 on Apple."
"9332560","9334460"," So what does that mean for you, right?"
"9335200","9336320"," You're going to..."
"9337260","9343200"," If you're already in the trade, you're at your first resistance."
"9344480","9346120"," Second major resistance 180. "
"9347600","9354160"," And then your third major resistance is at 185 and then sell the world at 190."
"9354960","9359420"," If you want to be a buyer in Tesla, your buy-in is at 166."
"9360800","9364440"," So set an alert for 165, 166. "
"9365600","9368880"," If it does slow down a little at any point, that's your buy-in."
"9369200","9373680"," Now if you want to take on a riskier bet, I can tell you right now that they're grinding through"
"9373680","9373960"," 174."
"9375100","9381020"," And if you see a break above, you want to take on more risk on Apple, you see a break"
"9381020","9384880"," above 175.44. You're going to ride that to 180. "
"9385380","9386500"," Get out of 180."
"9387140","9391140"," And then take it back again at 185."
"9392320","9393920"," And ride that to 185. "
"9395300","9399700"," So you just jump on between these, clear sailing between each one of these levels."
"9400260","9402600"," And you can see that Apple's trying to make a move."
"9402900","9408480"," This probably leads into, at some point, it probably leads into an end-of-the-day push. "
"9409120","9412220"," We start looking at all these different big tickers in tech, right?"
"9412640","9413940"," Where they're all at right now."
"9414600","9417500"," And all this leads me to believe that we're going to get that push in the end of day."
"9417960","9423600"," Now, if you get weakness in Apple down to 165, consider it like a happy day. "
"9423880","9429460"," Like, hey, I got to buy-in when we're trying to make a run at an STX up here."
"9429460","9431460"," And a cell signal at 190."
"9432480","9433440"," Hope this helps. "
"9436930","9437850"," Long XLF."
"9438070","9443070"," Yeah, you know, it's weird because I saw some calls coming in today for the finance for financials."
"9443650","9444730"," JPM wants to pay themselves. "
"9445510","9447070"," You know, it's interesting about XLF."
"9447390","9453250"," Everybody wonders why XLF and why the banks are never traded higher than where they are traded."
"9453950","9456690"," That is an extension of what took place in 2007. "
"9457390","9461150"," Some real old school banks, like small hedge funds and banks."
"9461150","9463990"," They've got real salty getting screwed over."
"9464590","9467630"," And that's why you see the banks trading at such low numbers. "
"9468090","9470630"," They'll never ever trade the banks again at high prices."
"9471650","9475830"," I have to talk about, I should do a video about that someday, the history of that, and why the"
"9475830","9476950"," banks trade so low."
"9480770","9482090"," Yeah, I miss that's hung up. "
"9483210","9486610"," All right, I'll check back in with you guys later this afternoon, okay?"
"9487030","9487690"," It's already noon time."
"9489410","9490470"," It's almost a three-hour stream."
"9490690","9490950"," It's crazy. "
"9491890","9493670"," Congratulations, any of you out there today."
"9494470","9495770"," I hope this feed has helped you."
"9496350","9500710"," And you can expect these whenever we're at a key pivot moment in the market. "
"9501310","9506950"," And if we're trading individual tickers, we want to know what the real supports are, where the real"
"9506950","9510390"," resistances are live during the daytime."
"9510770","9514270"," So we know we're more informed than a regular trader, ends down."
"9514710","9517890"," We have more information than most people out there trading during the day. "
"9518350","9519010"," Good luck."
"9520950","9521810"," Okay, one more."
"9521970","9523070"," I'll do Henry. "
"9523290","9524550"," I'll do AMD for your brother."
"9525830","9527370"," We'll do AMD right now."
"9527410","9528710"," I love AMD right now, too. "
"9530430","9531970"," I do love me some AMD."
"9544170","9544890"," Joey Harper."
"9545650","9549650"," I'm going to do AMD for you guys real quick before I get off here. "
"9550690","9552830"," I'm going to give you a shout here, Joe, in just a minute."
"9552990","9553130"," Okay."
"9553790","9555090"," I'm going to take a nice little break. "
"9555210","9557370"," If you have time, Joe, I'm going to give you a call."
"9557370","9566090"," It's a quick look."
"9572490","9574570"," Okay, so we've got critical support. "
"9575410","9577910"," Critical support on AMD at 140."
"9579090","9580830"," You should be making a run at one."
"9581230","9591150"," You're going to have minor resistance at 147 38 minor resistance at 149 99. "
"9592330","9600250"," Pretty decent resistance at 159 and then sell at 165 be a buyer anywhere at 140."
"9600250","9604070"," And then your stop loss is 130."
"9604670","9605510"," And this is heavy. "
"9605510","9606830"," This is heavy support here."
"9606970","9611330"," Why don't you guys see this right here that you've got heavy support at 140?"
"9612090","9616390"," I don't see you selling down below 140 today on AMD."
"9617970","9626000"," Let all your boys and friends and women and whatever girls out there, him, he, she, whatever it is"
"9626000","9626960"," you guys have out there. "
"9627660","9630960"," Let all your friends know that heavy support at 140."
"9631960","9635240"," You're looking to make a run for 160 to 165."
"9636280","9644280"," The stop loss, you could start your stops at 137.24. And sell the world at 130. "
"9645340","9649220"," Or, or by the dip at 130, I guess you could even look at it as a by the dip"
"9649220","9649880"," moment at 130."
"9654720","9656140"," I like the cut of your gym 2x."
"9656980","9658200"," Can't stop won't stop Andre. "
"9659540","9661240"," Dylan, diamond hands, my brother."
"9661240","9662540"," He's a frockenstein right on."
"9664720","9665560"," Hot, hot, hot. "
"9667550","9668590"," Yes, there is."
"9668790","9676250"," If you guys go to my main, if you guys go to my main Twitter handle on captains alpha, there's"
"9676250","9678370"," a pinned tweet at the top."
"9678810","9682350"," I think you can pay with just a credit card with no PayPal account. "
"9683070","9688310"," I think you can just like you tap on that one there and you can choose to either tip through"
"9688310","9693030"," PayPal or it'll give you like a, like a one time PayPal pass where you pay through."
"9693650","9694950"," Just a normal credit card."
"9695090","9696710"," You don't actually sign up for a PayPal account. "
"9697290","9701050"," You guys don't have to do it through through this link here in the description."
"9701550","9702850"," Check out the Twitter handle."
"9704030","9707670"," And a pinned pinned tweet at the bar at the above. "
"9707710","9709210"," I do appreciate that stuff."
"9709470","9712790"," That stuff keeps me motivated to keep doing this stuff truly."
"9713110","9715710"," So I didn't think that it would, but it really does. "
"9716050","9716430"," It really does."
"9716650","9719890"," It keeps me pumped up to keep coming out here and being excited."
"9719890","9721450"," So, so hot, hot, hot. "
"9721570","9722930"," I appreciate the support brother."
"9724570","9725590"," Thank you, Henry."
"9728250","9731070"," Yeah, Josh spies just consolidating. "
"9731190","9731710"," It's lunchtime."
"9732430","9734070"," You know, this happens at lunchtime."
"9734890","9738870"," You can take what you guys could do is just wait for four sixty five or four sixty. "
"9739150","9741370"," Grab yourself a spread and enjoy the ride."
"9743760","9747860"," You know, you grab a, you grab a spread on the spy for like calling it right in the money"
"9747860","9748780"," for sixty five."
"9749680","9751800"," Get some protection, some cheap puts. "
"9752100","9757760"," I guess if you want to be bearish, like 10 cent puts or something that expire today or expire on"
"9757760","9759380"," Thursday and you're good to go."
"9761930","9762670"," Yeah, Eric."
"9762870","9763970"," I think as a guest, it works. "
"9764670","9769310"," I think if you go to the, you go to my Twitter handle, you go to that pinned tweet, you"
"9769310","9774130"," click through there and you can just go on as a guest and then it bypasses PayPal."
"9774550","9776130"," You just get your credit card information."
"9776330","9777150"," It's one time deal. "
"9777910","9780410"," You don't have to worry about being like support and PayPal."
"9780950","9786050"," And I understand that you know what's crazy about that is ever like when I, if I take tips through"
"9786050","9789890"," YouTube, they take like 50% and they pay it like six months."
"9790370","9794770"," If I go through the Twitter tip cup, it's a big long disaster as well. "
"9795270","9799590"," And the cheapest way for you guys to get your money to me and not to them is to go"
"9799590","9800450"," through my Twitter handle."
"9801130","9803730"," That's the, that's the, that's the way to get me the money."
"9805150","9805690"," YouTube's great. "
"9805930","9810110"," Like some of these, I can't believe that some of these services, they want all your money."
"9810250","9812050"," It's like they'll take like 70%."
"9812050","9818150"," Dude, our YouTube takes, I think that's why I don't put any ads on my channel because YouTube takes"
"9818150","9820430"," all that money and then it messes with you guys. "
"9820570","9821450"," You guys get a bunch of ads."
"9822150","9826170"," So I don't do any ads or any advertising because that stuff is just nasty."
"9828550","9829710"," It's like, it's a scam. "
"9830850","9833970"," It's a scam by big, big processing."
"9834490","9843760"," Yeah, you did without a PayPal."
"9844080","9846360"," Thank you, Mahal for the, for the support. "
"9846500","9847400"," I really appreciate it."
"9848980","9849700"," Don't be ashamed."
"9850320","9851820"," Hey, man, I was a trader once. "
"9852160","9856460"," So when I first started trading, right, I had these guys on Wall Street bets that helped me become"
"9856460","9856920"," better trader."
"9857840","9858800"," And they would help."
"9858980","9862100"," I would back test my trades with them before I made them. "
"9862540","9864240"," Those guys made me a lot of money."
"9865100","9868940"," And so I always tipped, even if it was only five bucks or 10 bucks."
"9868940","9871660"," It made me feel better. "
"9871920","9874760"," I shouldn't be telling because this sounds like I'm begging for money, but I'm not."
"9875100","9877560"," It made me feel better to tip people that made me money."
"9878100","9878940"," I felt better. "
"9879260","9881440"," I wanted to tip people because they made me money."
"9882220","9885160"," Because I've had so many people not make me money."
"9885380","9887460"," There's so much noise out there that doesn't make me money. "
"9888060","9893580"," I have to cut through so much bullshit on social media to find the one guy that's like, Hey, this"
"9893580","9894320"," is how you make money."
"9894320","9900060"," And once you find that, you can get that mentorship and you can start to learn how to enter when"
"9900060","9902440"," to enter trades, when not to enter trades."
"9903140","9903780"," It's life changing. "
"9905740","9907900"," You stop losing money and start making money."
"9909720","9911500"," You hear that all the time, you hear that snark."
"9911680","9912740"," You hear snark out on the internet. "
"9913920","9919100"," Mostly they're either too cool for school or they're losing money."
"9919680","9921540"," You hear people snarky out there, they're losing trades."
"9922200","9923460"," They're just breaking even. "
"9924560","9926120"," You see some troll out there."
"9926620","9929380"," I'm telling you, people get spicy when they lose in all time."
"9933300","9934180"," Ooh, brave browser. "
"9934640","9934980"," I like it."
"9937600","9938180"," Thank you, Henry."
"9938360","9939720"," I appreciate the subscription brother. "
"9943630","9945910"," Chaz, I'll take a look at my DMs. I haven't had a chance."
"9947310","9948270"," Yeah, that is facts. "
"9948630","9950630"," You guys see, you guys see salty people out there."
"9951010","9953930"," You see people out there that don't post their trades before they happen."
"9954470","9955650"," You see people that come in later. "
"9955650","9959630"," I mean, some people who come in, they'll just be pumped and excited, because they don't want to"
"9959630","9960690"," show you the bad trades they're making."
"9960850","9961350"," That's all fine."
"9961470","9961950"," That's all good. "
"9962470","9963910"," But it's the ones that are snarky."
"9964470","9967830"," You know, the ones that are, you go into their feeds and you see that all they post is snark."
"9968370","9969630"," They never say, ooh, I won today. "
"9970010","9971890"," Even if they're not posting their plays before they happen."
"9973330","9975730"," People that just post like, yeah, I won't say that's great."
"9975890","9976490"," I like those posts. "
"9977370","9981290"," What I don't like is people that are just posting snark, like the real trolls."
"9981990","9983550"," They lend nothing."
"9984630","9987990"," They lend nothing to the conversation. "
"9992670","9996150"," Yeah, I'll flash the Tesla chart once more for you before I go."
"9997670","10001730"," Definitely hold on here."
"10005750","10007370"," It goes to Tesla chart. "
"10012720","10014640"," I'm going to take a minute for it to load up."
"10015640","10018480"," I'm probably getting throttled by Comcast right here."
"10019180","10020880"," Yeah, Comcast is evil. "
"10022360","10024140"," I've been on this stream for too long."
"10029000","10030860"," And I've got like their best package."
"10031380","10033520"," I think I got a phone call from them. "
"10033620","10035960"," They want me to upgrade to business or something stupid."
"10036620","10042140"," So I got to, I got to probably upgrade my, if one of these live streams every day, probably have"
"10042140","10047200"," to upgrade to a, to a business package, which sucks."
"10047860","10048880"," I can't stand Comcast. "
"10049240","10050380"," I want Google five or so bad."
"10051080","10052940"," And I have Google, Google fiber in my city."
"10053600","10056460"," And I just don't live where it is right now. "
"10065770","10067250"," So let's look at."
"10069970","10070730"," Same thing."
"10071030","10072810"," This is a, this is a great setup for Tesla. "
"10073190","10073270"," Okay."
"10074610","10076190"," You're a look at this setup for Tesla."
"10076430","10081230"," You remember this holiday trade for Tesla could take place into at least Christmas Eve. "
"10081510","10081630"," Okay."
"10082530","10083350"," In the market."
"10083870","10087430"," You'll see people, Wayne away and then they'll come back into it after Christmas. "
"10087870","10089110"," But this trade right now is."
"10089930","10092330"," Ten thousand, excuse me, one thousand."
"10093270","10095030"," To one thousand five is a buy area. "
"10096430","10099250"," You've got minor resistance at 10 15 and 10 20."
"10100670","10102670"," And blue skies to 10 50."
"10103250","10104750"," This is a great trade setup. "
"10105970","10109350"," You buy the dip at one thousand, which we have already bounced out of one thousand."
"10109350","10110870"," So you know you've got people in there."
"10111170","10114810"," You know the trade is, the trade is on to 10 50 right now. "
"10116110","10119110"," So that's another, that's another 45 point, another 50 point move."
"10119850","10120710"," Between now, now and close."
"10124170","10124690"," Ooh, I don't know. "
"10124690","10127390"," Are you going off to check to see if they have a TT fiber here?"
"10127830","10128630"," I never checked."
"10130990","10132430"," Yeah, Google fiber is the best."
"10134410","10139770"," You know, I have to start checking around because I think the best I can get here is. "
"10141490","10144410"," You know, Starlink is good, but not that, not that, not strong enough."
"10144570","10145450"," The latency is bad."
"10146610","10147650"," But I love Starlink. "
"10147950","10148490"," I am a sailor."
"10148830","10150130"," So I want to put Starlink on my boat."
"10154580","10156540"," We get over a gig up and down. "
"10156540","10160940"," Yeah, I got to check to see if any of the phone companies are offering fiber here."
"10162020","10163520"," Yeah, I'll check PFE for you."
"10163580","10164300"," Steven, no worries. "
"10164920","10165800"," I got your brother."
"10176220","10177300"," This will be the last one."
"10177460","10177620"," Okay. "
"10178300","10180100"," Yeah, probably 10 50 on the day."
"10180380","10181400"," It's what people are shooting for."
"10181640","10183360"," I know day traders are shooting for 10 50. "
"10183680","10184720"," 100% they are."
"10187180","10190120"," 100% day traders are looking at 10 50 as a price target for today."
"10191020","10192060"," Now, do they get there?"
"10192400","10194340"," I can't, you know, I can't, I don't have a crystal ball. "
"10195660","10199200"," Say, I can't crystal ball it, but that's what the day traders are targeting."
"10203170","10207170"," Without a doubt, day traders are targeting, or at least the FOMO day traders, ones that entered a"
"10207170","10207630"," little bit late."
"10208570","10210470"," After that night, after the nine 30 open. "
"10213090","10214730"," And it's, it's on, it's on the table at least."
"10215610","10218170"," There's a high probability of an attempt at it today."
"10219470","10219870"," Thanks. "
"10219990","10221310"," We're going to get this feed up and running."
"10231150","10231930"," Yeah, Josh."
"10232370","10233890"," Josh is like, you're still on. "
"10233890","10237010"," An hour ago, you said you were leaving."
"10244970","10247050"," That's a lots of consolidation on PFE."
"10247410","10252830"," I want you to be aware that, uh, there's a short operation on PFE right now by Morgan Stanley. "
"10253210","10253950"," Be aware of that."
"10255490","10258250"," There are easier stocks to make money on today."
"10258890","10263870"," If you're tied into PFE, uh, they're at critical support right now at 60. "
"10265130","10267450"," There are by the dippers down below at 58."
"10267450","10273390"," And then you've got sellers above at 61, 62, the major sellers are at 63."
"10273890","10278690"," If, if Pfizer, they like the Pfizer likes to drop cool news to spike it up. "
"10279410","10281350"," You're going to look for a squeeze at 63."
"10282010","10286190"," So maybe you ride it up from here at 59 to 63, get out, let the grind happen."
"10286190","10287810"," And then you'll see a squeeze above 63. "
"10289590","10292810"," It is, as a matter of fact, I'll bring it slightly closer for you."
"10293090","10295170"," This is where your wall is."
"10297400","10298860"," You could take this to. "
"10298860","10304500"," You could do 62.80. Wait for the grind and then take it again at 63.13 would be the"
"10304500","10305640"," squeeze point to go above."
"10306580","10312840"," Uh, $58 and $56 are sizing up as the by the, by the different crowd on PFE."
"10314480","10315360"," Oh, congratulations. "
"10315920","10316800"," I didn't know about that."
"10316900","10318060"," I'm on PFE."
"10319180","10319660"," Shansu. "
"10319880","10320360"," Shansu."
"10323940","10325520"," What did I do before I started trading?"
"10325900","10327220"," So I was in the military."
"10327220","10330260"," And then I became a business owner. "
"10330600","10332300"," I owned restaurant, nice, very nice restaurants."
"10333360","10335320"," And I could never seem to get ahead."
"10335820","10338100"," Very profitable, very popular restaurants. "
"10338880","10339980"," James Beard type stuff."
"10340660","10344940"," But I was kind of like the guy that just, I was, I was the, I was the gatekeeper for"
"10344940","10347400"," $3 million a year, but I never got to keep any of it."
"10348040","10351480"," I wasn't able to give good benefits and pay to my employees. "
"10352680","10355080"," Everything is against the small business owner in this country."
"10355460","10358340"," Everything is for corporate business owners."
"10359100","10363760"," As a small business owner, you have to, you have to really work hard to make a great living at"
"10363760","10363900"," it. "
"10364360","10368520"," And so I started to trade to make a future for myself, right?"
"10368640","10374400"," A retirement to make sure that my children, my wife would be taken care of."
"10374500","10377680"," And due to that, and of course, you know, you never know if you're going to have problems with"
"10377680","10378880"," medical bills, that kind of stuff."
"10378880","10383780"," And then I was taken under, I started to just trade stocks. "
"10384380","10387780"," I actually traded Bitcoin when it first came out years and years ago."
"10389040","10394340"," And then I started to trade individual stock tickers, just buying and selling stocks as an"
"10394340","10394600"," investor."
"10395840","10402460"," And when Wall Street Bets was created, I was an initial adopter of Reddit, an initial adopter of"
"10402460","10403120"," Wall Street Bets. "
"10404060","10408680"," And became very close with some very, very smart, real professionals."
"10409240","10411940"," And then I was taken into a private sub called Vegas Bets."
"10412840","10418360"," Met some guys in there and got taken under their wing, wound up meeting a pit trader, a market"
"10418360","10419380"," maker over the years. "
"10419800","10421980"," And they taught me how to trade, how to make money."
"10422520","10423380"," There's a big difference too."
"10423840","10427120"," You'll find very highly technical traders out there and make great money. "
"10427260","10433100"," They're very smart, very wrinkle-brained, right?"
"10433100","10438040"," I think I'm getting that in the opposite, but, you know, see some technical traders out there."
"10438380","10442280"," But then you see retail traders that overcomplicate their trades."
"10442680","10446060"," I found that when I dumbed down my trading, I had to gain a better trader. "
"10446700","10447200"," I've traded everything."
"10447380","10450620"," I've traded penny stocks, small caps, mid caps, tech."
"10451360","10454960"," I've traded oil, gas, got wrecked, I've done it, I've traded everything. "
"10456000","10460120"," And what I found was that when I simplified my trading plan, when I started to just trade the"
"10460120","10463260"," indexes and just focused on one or two stocks at a time."
"10463840","10467800"," And then when I started to dumb down what I was doing, not overcomplicate myself."
"10468080","10471340"," And I switched from bear to bull and I had some great mentors. "
"10471740","10472700"," My trading became better."
"10472820","10479460"," I became a better trader, became profitable, and was able to not be involved in the restaurant"
"10479460","10483760"," business anymore and became a full-time day trader and swing trader and investor."
"10484880","10486540"," I've never looked back from then. "
"10486540","10491960"," And that's been been trading for, I used to say, oh, I've been trading for five to seven years."
"10493060","10495300"," And then recently I started saying, oh, I've been trading for 10 years."
"10496140","10498640"," But I think I've been trading total for 12 years at this point. "
"10501520","10501980"," Yeah, wrinkle brains."
"10505230","10511530"," Yeah, I can talk about, we'll have those conversations where I talk about the stuff that I've been"
"10511530","10516110"," taught over the years, because there are some critical things you need to know that do make the"
"10516110","10517530"," difference between winning and losing trades."
"10518390","10521150"," Patience is a big one to big one. "
"10522430","10524030"," Letting the trade come to you."
"10524350","10526470"," Another big one for me is not chasing trades."
"10527490","10528850"," Chasing trades, man. "
"10529210","10532550"," Once you get over chasing trades, life goes on an easy street."
"10536120","10536260"," Yeah."
"10540620","10542560"," Yeah, so I'm from the west. "
"10542780","10544040"," I'm from out west."
"10544780","10549980"," I moved to Michigan recently to buy cheap houses."
"10549980","10554420"," So when you live out west, I don't know who, I don't know how many, I don't know where all"
"10554420","10559920"," you guys live, but you think things are expensive out here in the east, but out west, you never"
"10559920","10560660"," really get ahead. "
"10561160","10564100"," They take your money until you die, and then you left with nothing."
"10564860","10572760"," And when I was young, my father had taken us into Boston when it was being gentrified and he bought"
"10572760","10576740"," cheap houses there, built, rebuilt them, and made a good life for us."
"10577820","10579240"," And I followed in his footsteps. "
"10579900","10585980"," What I did was I came to Detroit and found cheap houses and salary building them, bought them"
"10585980","10591800"," outright, built them, or rehab them and started selling them and owning them and living in them."
"10593440","10595040"," And this has been the past couple of years."
"10595980","10598280"," So now I live with no mortgage, I don't pay a mortgage. "
"10598860","10601160"," The story that the traits of hell is wrong."
"10601740","10605100"," That's a story that they sell to attract businesses."
"10605360","10606700"," Those years are way past. "
"10607680","10608540"," But I am moving."
"10610320","10610900"," Excuse me."
"10611360","10612960"," At some point, I move back to the west. "
"10613360","10618480"," I think without my daughters will get a great education at one of the University of Michigan"
"10618480","10618700"," schools."
"10618900","10621640"," They have the highest concentration of engineers in the country here."
"10622340","10624620"," People don't believe that either, but you still have the big three. "
"10625400","10627860"," They're launching big EV here as well."
"10628600","10630280"," So there's a lot of opportunity for that."
"10630720","10633060"," But I wanted to be able to, I didn't want to be a slave anymore. "
"10633820","10639160"," So I didn't want to, I didn't want to be at risk of losing a home if I had a"
"10639160","10639840"," medical issue."
"10640300","10642540"," I didn't want, I wanted to have something to give to my kids."
"10643880","10647780"," Like, like in the past, in the past people used to buy houses with no mortgages. "
"10648220","10650780"," The mortgages were an advent of the 1930s."
"10650940","10652160"," I think it was the 1930s."
"10652520","10656760"," It was the boomers that came back, well not the boomers, but the soldiers that came back from war. "
"10657880","10662840"," Pre the pre-World War II, you had to either build your house or you had to pay for it"
"10662840","10663160"," with cash."
"10664800","10668040"," And after the war, mortgages became popular."
"10668300","10671960"," But even then, in that generation, they bought their homes eventually. "
"10672340","10674480"," They didn't keep mortgages second, third, fourth mortgages."
"10674480","10680160"," I was on an advent of like the 60s, 70s, like when you're doing second, third, fourth mortgages on"
"10680160","10681980"," that fourth, like second, third mortgages in houses."
"10682720","10683980"," And we've lost some of that. "
"10684200","10687400"," So for me personally, I wanted to own real, real estate."
"10688380","10692580"," And I wanted to be a part of a gentrification of a city that would hopefully come back."
"10693140","10697320"," I'm banking on more tech coming to Detroit because there's only so much room in places like Silicon"
"10697320","10697880"," Valley. "
"10698700","10704280"," You'll see these cities will go through 20, 20 to 50 year changes, right?"
"10704280","10706920"," They'll get destroyed and they'll come back."
"10707380","10709840"," So I'm making a long-term investment to my kids."
"10710080","10712000"," I'm saying to myself, hey, but I'm gone. "
"10712580","10718800"," And if my kids have these properties, then they'll mature into something that is valuable and real"
"10718800","10720380"," that no one can take away from me."
"10724350","10725110"," That's all true."
"10725630","10726670"," And so that's what I did. "
"10727010","10727670"," And so I have that."
"10727850","10732330"," You know, I have a house here in Detroit where no matter where I go, no matter what I do"
"10732330","10734210"," the rest of my life, I know I have some place."
"10734210","10735390"," I always have a home. "
"10735850","10739730"," I can leave it to my kids to go to college, so they don't have to pay for rent and"
"10739730","10740370"," stuff like that."
"10741390","10744790"," So, you know, those are my, that's what I want out of life."
"10744970","10746450"," You guys all want your own things for me. "
"10747450","10754410"," I wanted that security, you know, and Detroit's great place."
"10754570","10755370"," It's not for everybody."
"10755930","10760210"," The things that I miss, I miss, they have good hiking out here, but I miss the mountains. "
"10761210","10762090"," I miss the desert."
"10762470","10763650"," I miss the ocean in the sky."
"10763650","10765290"," I miss surfing. "
"10765730","10770910"," I still do that stuff now that when I live here cheaply, so I fly everywhere."
"10771170","10774610"," Some of you guys have known me for a while and some of you guys know that I fly out"
"10774610","10776110"," to the west and I'll go surfing."
"10776310","10776750"," I'll go skiing. "
"10777210","10779110"," I post pictures of that stuff sometimes on Twitter."
"10779810","10783410"," So I'm able to afford to take the vacations that I want to get that out of me at least."
"10783930","10784690"," It kind of helps. "
"10785210","10787950"," Sometimes I'll spend a week or a month out in Utah or Colorado."
"10789050","10791410"," I'll spend a month or a week out in California."
"10791970","10793810"," I'll go surf the coast and camp on the beach. "
"10794570","10795850"," And so I get that out of my system."
"10796230","10798010"," I'll go hike for a few weeks in the summertime."
"10798370","10800510"," Early summer, late summer, I'll take a week or two trip. "
"10803640","10805040"," Yeah, man, I can't do that anymore."
"10805540","10806580"," I ran that race."
"10806920","10808080"," I was in that race, you know. "
"10808400","10809500"," It was a big giant second sum."
"10809980","10811400"," My wife and I were making six figures."
"10811880","10812560"," It didn't matter. "
"10812760","10813360"," You never got ahead."
"10813520","10814380"," You never truly got ahead."
"10815260","10817100"," You think you're ahead, right?"
"10817620","10821160"," Until you get older and you realize that it's all a string. "
"10821680","10823080"," That half the car is your own."
"10824100","10830920"," You see people that look like they're wealthy or at least upper middle class and they are one"
"10830920","10833160"," problem away from losing everything."
"10833620","10834500"," Declaring bankruptcy. "
"10835640","10838140"," I'm telling you that people know this from 2000s."
"10839160","10841200"," They know it from the late 80s."
"10841820","10847080"," I watched my dad lose his houses in the 80s. "
"10848540","10850320"," He had everything he lost at all."
"10856710","10858570"," Yeah, you don't want to buy the top in Silicon Valley."
"10860150","10861590"," Yeah, I don't want to do any of that stuff. "
"10861830","10864690"," I don't want to, I don't want to, I've seen it happen to too many people."
"10865030","10865830"," I'm getting older now."
"10866050","10867110"," Like not as young as I once was. "
"10867310","10873590"," I was always optimistic, but then as I started to get into my late 30s, I realized that I needed"
"10873590","10875010"," more security for me."
"10876470","10879530"," For me, when I, when my needs were, you know, it's interesting."
"10879530","10884230"," Like real wealth is rarely passed on to a second generation. "
"10885230","10891330"," Wealthy people do that very frequently, but people that are worth a million dollars, three million"
"10891330","10895870"," dollars, they typically don't pass on real wealth to their children."
"10896610","10898370"," I'm going to pass on some money and stuff."
"10898970","10899870"," I'm talking about real wealth. "
"10900310","10901370"," Real wealth is a weird thing."
"10901650","10907270"," Like when you're, when you're passing on real wealth to future generations, it's a whole different"
"10907270","10907710"," ballgame."
"10907710","10911770"," And so for me, I have to do it on a smaller level. "
"10919210","10921410"," You're walking quantum leap, I hope everything is helped."
"10923960","10925680"," Yeah, most flaunting out there is credit."
"10927560","10927960"," 100%. "
"10927960","10929540"," 100%."
"10929540","10931200"," I don't even own new cars anymore."
"10931560","10934220"," Bob Metaslos used, Bob Mike, Escalade used. "
"10934880","10935260"," I mean, they were newer."
"10935740","10936660"," I got a good deal on them too."
"10936800","10938140"," I waited until I got the right price. "
"10939200","10941360"," But I don't need to flaunt anything to anybody out there."
"10942000","10942860"," To nobody."
"10944100","10947200"," I just need to take, this is the same as trading, right?"
"10948720","10951560"," Don't worry about what other people are saying about you as a trader. "
"10952540","10956560"," The snark people, because at the end of the day, the only thing that matters is that you're winning"
"10956560","10957100"," your trades."
"10957680","10958820"," You're winning your investments."
"10959540","10962420"," It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks about you out there. "
"10963320","10967260"," When you get like that in your head or you start to beat yourself up in the head, what does"
"10967260","10969200"," David A trader think about me?"
"10969340","10970820"," Or they made a comment to me?"
"10971180","10973300"," Remember that you look in your bank account."
"10973660","10974920"," They don't pay your bills."
"10975280","10976980"," They don't take care of your family. "
"10977160","10978520"," They don't take care of your friends."
"10978960","10980080"," They don't take care of you."
"10980840","10982840"," It's only you taking care of you. "
"10983260","10985240"," Nobody else is taking care of you out there."
"10985400","10988720"," So feel good about yourself and what you're doing out there, okay?"
"10989360","10990680"," And there's never a dumb question."
"10992800","10994700"," You don't need those people in your life. "
"10995300","10996960"," Just mute those people."
"10998300","11002020"," You just need people in your life that are there to help you along in your journey and your life"
"11002020","11002340"," too."
"11007440","11008820"," All right guys, I'm going to head out of here. "
"11008940","11009820"," You guys have a great afternoon."
"11012240","11012580"," I did."
"11013060","11014920"," I was one of the Detroit market. "
"11015140","11015620"," You ready for this?"
"11015780","11016740"," You guys want to hear a crazy story?"
"11017920","11027800"," I got here in Detroit at the last auctions where they still had houses going for anywhere from"
"11027800","11031060"," $1,500 to $15,000."
"11031300","11034180"," Real nice places for like $50,000 to $100,000."
"11034880","11039020"," So the houses I bought for $1,500 to $15,000. "
"11039520","11043800"," On rehab, they're worth $80,000 to $120,000 right now."
"11044600","11045160"," On rehab."
"11045900","11046860"," Fixed up. "
"11047220","11048460"," They're going for market prices."
"11049040","11052520"," Market prices, $150,000, $200,000, $300,000."
"11053860","11054560"," That wild. "
"11056520","11061480"," Literally right at the end, tail end of the Detroit chit hole is when I got here."
"11065050","11067570"," Never finance depreciating assets."
"11068130","11069490"," And there's still deals in Detroit. "
"11070510","11071230"," You'd be surprised."
"11072030","11074530"," And you can turn these houses into Airbnb's."
"11074610","11075550"," You don't have to deal with renters. "
"11076250","11077210"," You fix them up real nice."
"11077370","11082630"," That's one cool part about Detroit right now is there's no hotel infrastructure in Detroit."
"11082630","11086630"," There's some, but only concentrated in the inner circle of downtown. "
"11087450","11094350"," So there's a great Airbnb movement here because you have engineers from all around the world that"
"11094350","11096090"," come to Detroit around the world."
"11096090","11096950"," These engineers come."
"11097210","11102830"," So GM Ford and Chevy or GM Ford and Cadillac and GMC. "
"11103170","11104470"," All these big car companies."
"11105470","11107750"," They source out all their engineering now."
"11107750","11113570"," So you'll see like a small company on the outskirts of the suburbs of Detroit, right?"
"11113710","11117350"," They'll have an engineering firm, but they outsource to a company in China. "
"11117930","11123610"," That makes the dies and makes the trims, the interior trims, x-area stuff for these cars, right?"
"11124090","11126170"," But these, you'll have these people who are traveling in Detroit."
"11126630","11129990"," And they only have like, I don't know, like small choices for hotels."
"11130630","11137030"," So if you renovate a house here and you Airbnb it to business people, engineers and stuff, you make"
"11137030","11137770"," real good money. "
"11138770","11143030"," Because there's not always a hotel nearby where these engineering firms are."
"11143650","11146570"," Remain while they're traveling through Detroit to get to one of these firms."
"11151450","11151890"," All right. "
"11153770","11155830"," Yeah, hutch Detroit bottoms."
"11156030","11161930"," And dude, the moment that it bottoms, like it was crazy because it went from like five hundred to"
"11161930","11164030"," fifteen hundred dollar houses at the Wayne County auction."
"11164650","11166670"," And then all of a sudden now everything's through the roof. "
"11166670","11167630"," You can't even get a house."
"11167630","11173290"," Now they're selling like burned out shelves of homes for like thirty thousand dollars, fifty"
"11173290","11175030"," thousand dollars right now."
"11175550","11177970"," And you're buying them for fifteen hundred, five thousand. "
"11178350","11180970"," You're buying burned out shelves back then for five hundred bucks."
"11181490","11187030"," Matter of fact, when Detroit first started burning, they were selling mansions in downtown Detroit"
"11187030","11187950"," that were a dollar."
"11188730","11190770"," Like take it, take the house off my hands. "
"11191190","11192390"," Those houses are now worth millions."
"11197030","11197950"," Thanks for the update."
"11198170","11202350"," Nailed that Tesla just got a dark cool print at a thousand four currently trading above. "
"11205370","11206790"," Yeah, we have a trust now."
"11207030","11208830"," We have the we do a trust now."
"11211290","11212810"," Yeah, Milwaukee is popping. "
"11213030","11215910"," I've got some friends, some investor from real estate investor friends."
"11216330","11219170"," They've been in the Milwaukee market for the last year."
"11219450","11221830"," They've been in the Milwaukee market, the Dayton market. "
"11223010","11225770"," And there's some still some hesitation and there's some."
"11226030","11226530"," It's weird."
"11226530","11228310"," Like Cleveland is there, but not there. "
"11228630","11231910"," It's like it's like it's it's consolidating, but Dayton is hot."
"11232070","11234810"," Dayton is super hot and Milwaukee is really hot."
"11235190","11236350"," Really, really hot. "
"11236710","11240390"," And the one place I forget what the name of town is Northern, Northern Michigan."
"11240570","11244170"," There's a flint is not there yet, but it is going to be there."
"11244450","11248470"," Flint's right now is like Detroit was 10, 15 years ago. "
"11250210","11250810"," I did."
"11250870","11251370"," I bought the debt."
"11252230","11253470"," I wasn't my dude. "
"11253630","11255830"," So he has a funny story for you."
"11255830","11258990"," So I'm living in like a really nice house out west."
"11258990","11260490"," I got every I am on paper. "
"11260650","11261010"," I look great."
"11261630","11266550"," And when I decided to move here, my family and my wife's family."
"11267210","11268250"," It was not good. "
"11269530","11273450"," They were not not happy at all with my decisions."
"11274270","11277030"," I was looked at very poorly."
"11278110","11279690"," But I knew I knew. "
"11280930","11280990"," Sorry."
"11281170","11281830"," There you go."
