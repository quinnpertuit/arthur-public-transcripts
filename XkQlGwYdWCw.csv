"XkQlGwYdWCw","0","5300"," All right."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5300","9080"," This is better."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9080","15360"," I think that I figured it out and I got the microphone working, which is badass, and I"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","15360","23200"," think I got everything going."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","23200","41960"," I think I might have figured this out finally, but I think I worked out two issues I was"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","41960","42960"," having."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","42960","57800"," I think I can do just a second here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","57800","68560"," I think I figured everything out, so I just re-ran, but I did was, I changed, I took my,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","68560","78160"," I had my, I had my desktop on, plugged into my desk, which has a bunch of outlets and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","78160","79160"," stuff on it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","79160","86160"," It's like wired in, and I separated my desktop, so I don't know."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","86160","87160"," We'll see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","87160","96960"," I was thinking maybe there was, maybe there was too much on one, on one circuit?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","96960","99360"," I don't know."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","99360","106440"," So we're going to see if this works, and we're going to work this out."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","106440","109640"," This is what I was going through before when I was like, I'm going to fucking, I'm going"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","109640","122800"," to fucking take a flamethrower, I think I'm done."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","122800","142880"," Current order book, figure column, aggregate."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","142880","150360"," This is also bizarre, I got like problems with, and that sounds good, we'll do as well, we'll"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","150360","163120"," load the entire day, three hours of storage, load all that up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","163120","166720"," Trying to retest that 440 down below here, see if we can catch it or not."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","166720","169680"," Let me just take an area to load up some stuff."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","169680","175640"," I think, I think my mic is fixed too, and I think I can hear, trade the news finally,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","175640","179680"," so I'll be talking over, trade the news, and I think I'll be able to hear it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","180680","184640"," Yeah, I can hear trade the news now, fuck yeah, finally."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","184640","188920"," This shit's crazy, whenever every time I rebuild this stuff you have to go through and rebuild"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","188920","195680"," every single aspect of it, and if you miss one little part, you're kind of fucked up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","195680","201320"," So I can hear trade the news now, which is nice, I'm not going to talk over Charlie talking"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","201320","203040"," or whatever."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","203040","205040"," It drives me fucking baddie."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","206040","208800"," Yes, there we go."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","208800","215000"," We're loading up the entire day, I think, so we can get back to 9.30 here, and there we"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","215000","230720"," go, it's perfect."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","230720","232720"," That shit was driving me fucking baddie."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","232720","235680"," I think that this should be it, I don't know."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","235680","236680"," We'll see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","236680","246360"," This is the kind of stuff that drives me fucking nuts, but Aomar, how are you?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","246360","252560"," Yeah, what I did was, I really spoke meat."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","252560","260280"," Yeah, so what I did was I rebooted the computer and I moved the tower onto its own dedicated"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","260280","262280"," circuit."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","262280","271160"," I have a bunch of stuff on one circuit, and then I have my desk wired in, like plugs"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","271160","277720"," on the desk, they're wired into the wall and all that, so I switched the circuit, there's"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","277720","285560"," nothing else on this circuit, maybe, I don't know, maybe it's the interrupted power supply"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","285560","286560"," possibly."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","286560","294520"," Maybe I have to get a battery bank or something, but it kicked off, it was kicking off every"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","294520","295520"," few seconds."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","295520","308440"," I took the glass off like Winky told me to do, keep it cool, so we'll see if that helps."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","308440","311520"," A little bit of a cold beer bump on this one right here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","311520","314400"," One, two, and three."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","314400","320240"," Now this kind of do or die for the bulls."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","320240","336080"," Okay, so a question for you, so still have 140,000 puts, so we're at 92,000, we're at"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","336080","343280"," 90,000 puts, we're at 50,000 puts early, now we're at 140,000, so tripling down on puts,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","343280","361680"," we're only worth $1.32 now, this is expiring on 413, 440p, and so I guess our big question"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","361680","370480"," is, why do they keep loading up on puts?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","370480","376920"," I see the basing on VIX, I see that, I get that VIX should be going up right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","376920","387440"," This has to do with Biden, I can't see any other reason, why I wouldn't have something"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","387440","391880"," to do with Biden speaking at 230, someone must know some shit that we don't know, or they're"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","391880","398960"," just expecting volatility into the Biden speech, I haven't seen anything else about"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","398960","413520"," the Biden speech today anywhere, but I'm gonna look it up right now when I have a moment."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","413520","420200"," But I am concerned about it, because everything is saying, here indicator is up, there's still"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","420200","427600"," no real money selling, I mean the call buyers are there, they've been there all day long."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","427600","433000"," The dip buyers are there all day long, so there's something that I don't know, there's"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","433000","439360"," some volatility in the market saying that we're going down, I mean I see why we're going"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","439360","454800"," down here, son of a bitch, and did it just get rid of my, no it didn't."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","454800","460280"," So I mean there's mixed signals in the market right now, like I want to buy this dip bad"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","460280","465280"," right now, but you know how it goes right, if Biden is going to speak at 230 you end"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","465280","471240"," up getting weakness, and then we come back almost always, unless there's some news about"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","471240","476040"," Biden coming out there, we don't know about yet, something unknown, we were talking about"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","476040","481120"," if it could be an unannounced rate hike, you don't know what could be said, Brady was"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","481120","486480"," kind of a nothing burger to an extent, I'll check right now and see if Biden's still"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","486480","491640"," speaking, but when I was told yesterday, I'll trade the news, they said 230 this afternoon,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","491640","499600"," he's going to give a speech about prices, about something actionable to get prices down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","499600","507360"," Normally I'd buy this, I'd buy this dip right here, normally I'd buy this dip right now,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","507360","512000"," it's a perfect setup, it's been a minute now to the results of the Treasury's $34 billion"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","512000","518800"," 10 year note reopening, this is a perfect set up to cover the last option, it was $2.47."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","518800","525680"," It changed that fucking color back to green, not that green though, not that green either,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","525680","533600"," don't want that lime green, I got some questions for you guys out there, because no, not that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","533600","537280"," green, that's nasty green, come on now give me a better green."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","537280","543600"," It's an ugly green too, all right, fuck it, we'll just take the shitty green."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","543600","548400"," Like normally even this is perfect right, let me just look at that right, nice one, two,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","548400","564320"," three, bam, bam, that's how you do it right there, textbook, 101 right there, perfect setup."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","564320","570800"," Why am I hesitant? I'm hesitant because the market is rolling over, I'm hesitant because"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","572640","576240"," there is a bit in the market, there's some good news in this market, right, if you get market"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","576240","580880"," internals it's not rolling over but it's rotating."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","581440","589440"," A 10 year reopening, drawing at 2.72%, 66.6% allowed high bit to cover 2.43,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","595280","600320"," and 2.43 bit to cover, it's a little lower than 2.47 prior and the 8 auction"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","601280","603120"," reopening average of 2.49."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","603120","616720"," The TLT is rolling the fuck over again, which lines up with Biden's speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","626000","632080"," Spy testing the lows again down below here, we are seeing currently some of the rug pull going"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","632080","637200"," on right now at 4.40. We don't like seeing this black area back over here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","642480","645360"," We don't like this wall of sellers coming in right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","649200","654080"," I don't like the weakness that that speech could bring, him saying making that statement yesterday."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","656160","658320"," I don't like what he could say in this speech today."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","659200","662880"," I don't know what he could say to bring prices down. That's what he said yesterday,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","662880","667920"," I think it was Corey yesterday saying or whatever her packy or whatever her name is"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","670160","672720"," said that she wants to bring prices down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","678480","682000"," The only way that I see them bring prices down is the Prime Minister Johnson saying he's paid"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","682000","687360"," his coronavirus lockdown fine, saying it did not occur to him that gathering was a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","687440","692800"," breach of the rules, apologizing for him, the mistake that he made."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","694800","701840"," That's funny. The key being is how do you bring prices down? It could be new trade,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","703600","709920"," could be we're opening up the oil fields, could be I don't know open up pipelines,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","709920","715760"," it could be taxes, could be a rate hike that's unannounced."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","718160","723200"," So I'm assuming there's going to be some weakness based upon him coming in,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","723200","726400"," because it's not adding up. It's not adding up right now why someone's buying"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","727360","729120"," tripling down on fucking puts here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","733520","734400"," So there's some concern."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","737440","738960"," So we'll see if 440 holds."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","738960","749520"," I'm not and I'm flat, I'm in no positions right now. I'm not short either."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","754960","759840"," Brainerd was was Brainerd was actually quite bullish, not bullish, but dovish in her speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","761200","766000"," She point blank. Well, then first of all, remember, when we were saying that they were going to do QT"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","766080","770640"," in May, and now she's saying we're going to do QT in June."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","773040","777200"," So there we go, right? The market should fucking rip all time, not all time highs,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","777200","781440"," but the market should be ripping on that news and the market's pissed."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","786800","790560"," And she said that they would have a late hand, late touch to the economy."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","790560","793440"," They don't want to destroy the economy. They don't want to destroy the stock market"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","794400","797120"," and push the jury session, which I believe"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","799600","803920"," that they're going to do all they can not push it, whether they're successful or not,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","804720","808160"," they can actually have an impact on that or not. It's not that important."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","809280","812560"," I think the point is in her statement is that they're not bringing in a Volcker"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","813520","817680"," right now until that Senate is done and then the presidential election is done."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","823840","834240"," And we saw, we probably saw the original run up and saying they've not seen anything to confirm"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","834240","840640"," report that Russian military equipment is being sent to the Finnish border."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","843040","844880"," We probably saw the original run up in"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","845600","851360"," to 462 because people knew that was, that's the case, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","853520","858240"," And you know, that'd be the same thought process. I guess that's my point behind"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","864080","870640"," the bank helping out the VIX trade that my question is, are there so many fucking banks"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","870640","876720"," wrapped up in long tail risk trades that they have to dump it before we start"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","876720","883920"," fucking cranking to, are they already committed to us dumping down to 400, 360, so it's a contrived"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","883920","889920"," market, knowing that eventually because they're going to massage the market and the economy for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","889920","894880"," the next, you know, fucking two years, they'll just contrive the entire fucking thing."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","895360","902160"," Because the truth is, they're going to run it up until they break it. But the fact that,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","902160","906160"," the other fact of that though, is if they didn't know that, or that Fed puts, right,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","906160","911040"," the Fed put, they know is there now, to an extent,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","913680","916640"," of the state of course, to print the puts that they have to get us down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","918720","921600"," Unless there's some shit that's happening with Biden that I don't know about,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","922480","929120"," today has got to be something. You know, what the fuck is he going to say to fucking control"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","929120","935200"," prices? There's only a few things that he can say, whether he's going to solve shortages,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","935200","945360"," either he like takes over the ports or something, takes over trucking, price mandates, taxes,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","945600","954000"," or is it just bullshit talk? If it's just bullshit talk, they're going to still let inflation run high."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","955280","960560"," Which I think she even said that, Brainer kind of hinted to that too, right? They kind of like"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","960560","968080"," inflation to an extent, because it does take the money out of your pocketbooks and your wallets."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","975520","991040"," Yeah, I think it's all a scam too. I'm on the scam side of things."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","993040","994880"," I think it's all manufactured to an extent."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","997840","1002800"," Still lots of sellers coming in right now, sellers leaning into spy, trying to break through that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1002880","1007920"," 440 support that we have. Bulls do not want to give this up. If they do give this up,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1007920","1011920"," we talked about this one earlier. Yeah, it's clear skies, clear skies below."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1013280","1018320"," You can see it down here. 439, 438, you break it down and you get into 433."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1018320","1023120"," This is where the JPM caller is down below here. The JPM wants this. Maybe they get it sooner than"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1023120","1031040"," later. It'd be interesting to see too, if he closes those put spreads, if he ends up closing"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1031040","1039920"," those put spreads, the impact that'll have on the market. He, I call him he, Jamie."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1043920","1048320"," So let's see if they got to sooner than later here or not, if we break through the support"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1048320","1057920"," or if we trade higher. I would like to see 230 or so. If people are still loaded to the tents on puts"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1058000","1064560"," at 230, I'll end up taking that long trade heading into that speech or near that speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1064560","1073840"," I'm going to check up on it right now and find out if that speech is still legit."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1088880","1094320"," Or if anybody knows if he's speaking today."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1101120","1105360"," Yeah, right here. Oh, you know what? He's actually changing it. So he, they've, they've put some"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1105360","1112560"," color to this speech. It's today at 345 p.m., not 230. President Biden delivers remarks on lowering"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1112560","1120000"," energy costs. And then it's a little more obscure afterwards. It says President Biden makes an"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1120000","1126160"," announcement on his administration's actions to lower costs for working families."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1128640","1135360"," Reduce the impact of Putin's price hike, which is complete fucking bullshit. Putin did not do a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1135360","1145360"," fucking price hike. That's so fucking stupid. You know what? It doesn't matter if the Republicans"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1145360","1150400"," are Democrats. They're both going to do this stupid shit and build a better America with"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1150400","1158000"," bipartisan infrastructure law investments in rural communities. So I guess he's going to address"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1160880","1163120"," three different aspects. It sounds like fluff."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1165760","1167040"," The whole thing sounds like fluff."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1176720","1180640"," Reduce the impact of Putin's price hike. So stupid."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1180640","1195680"," Yeah, I thought, you know, Trump would have done the same thing. It doesn't fucking matter."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1196800","1200320"," Fucking, it doesn't matter who the fucking president was. It'd be fucking blaming whoever."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1202240","1203600"," It doesn't matter if it's fucking,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1203600","1214960"," yeah, it's stupid. If you guys go back, you can just, you guys can go back."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1216400","1224400"," Putin talked at the, and I believe it was the, some EU conference on gas last November,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1224400","1230400"," December or something. And he was pretty plain. Like for everything I don't like Putin for,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1230400","1235200"," of course, I don't fucking like that guy at all. But that speech was insane to listen to because"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1235200","1242320"," he was point blank honest about the price that he sells gas to Europe and then the companies"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1242320","1253840"," within Europe that actually are the ones fucking straight up taking money or charging a much higher"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1253840","1257920"," price, right? That's almost like a mafia. But I guess olive oil and gas is like that anyways."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1261120","1264960"," A little bit of strength now, a little bit of squeezing higher on the spy currently."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1270880","1275120"," So the whole thing's kind of weird is all I want to say about that. So that speech, though,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1275120","1280480"," isn't until 345 this afternoon, not at 230. I thought it was 230 yesterday, but whatever."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1281360","1283840"," So that could take place after the bell at some point."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1283840","1291920"," If he they're saying 345, he's always late. So I'd assume that it's going to be after the bell."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1292960","1297360"," So you got no real volatility until after or until maybe leading into the bell."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1302800","1306960"," You've got some put holders that want to see those puts print. I don't know if they let them"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1306960","1313680"," print today. I don't know. Maybe Vix is still rising right now as we're squeezing higher."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1322640","1327200"," Yeah, the taxes on gas. Well, there's this whole like there's a whole I'll try to find the speech"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1327200","1331920"," one day a link to the speech for you guys. It was fucking wild to listen to that speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1332000","1337680"," You know, I do not like Putin at all, but he was very he's pretty fucking blunt and honest as to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1337680","1345120"," the price of gas and what what what Europe pays for it and then what the consumer ends up paying for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1345120","1351680"," it. And the, you know, like the vat, there's a it's a huge markup from what he sells it for to them."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1352240","1354080"," And then the consumer ends up paying."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1362720","1371520"," You know, I don't think that they want food prices, though, to be honest with you, they want"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1371520","1380240"," inflation to an extent. The more money out of your pocket, right means. So the idea is this is the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1380240","1384000"," truth. You don't want to hear this, especially if you're poor, right? You don't want to hear this."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1384000","1389680"," There's a couple classes. Like if you're poor, you don't want to hear this. If you're lower,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1389680","1395280"," no, if you're, if you're lower middle come, you don't want to hear this. You don't want to hear"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1395280","1398720"," this if you're rich, but the on the poorer side of rich, you don't want to hear these things."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1398720","1404000"," Like it was like lower if each class, the lower class of each class, doesn't want to hear"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1405360","1409680"," that we actually want inflation because they're good. Those people are going to feel the most pain."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1412320","1418400"," Like when I should say this, I should I'm mis I'm using misnomers here. So like if you can take loans"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1418400","1424400"," out, you're good for the system, but like if you're they're trying to get money out of the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1424400","1429360"," system so that you're not demanding certain things, they don't want you going to the store to buy"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1429920","1436880"," by a fucking lumber or wanting a brand new truck. Does that make, if that makes sense?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1439520","1444880"," So they're trying to take the demand away to alleviate shortages. So that's like step one, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1445760","1451520"," And then step two is they want you to not have as much money to be spending. So they don't want"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1451520","1456320"," everybody employed. They want a certain amount of people that are unemployed or searching for work"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1456320","1464800"," or taking lower pay. They need to remove some of the money from the system. And that lowers"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1464800","1470640"," inflation. Some of those, some of those aspects lower inflation. Right now the demand is so high,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1470720","1474720"," everybody's got a fucking fat checkbook and people are looking to spend."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1475920","1479840"," For a fruitful operation, 85 kind of parties taking 1.71 trillion dollars."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1483440","1486480"," So how do they get that? And then the other part is right, they're talking about talking about"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1487200","1493440"," QT, but they're not doing QT, right? They say they want to do QT and may now it's June. Well,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1493440","1499280"," at least that's what she said today was June now is what they're talking about implementing it. So"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1501600","1505040"," I mean, the real question is are they going to take the money out of the system or not? They"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1505040","1510320"," have to get the money out of the system until they get the money out of the system or cash rich."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1510320","1513760"," I'm reading articles around, I'm reading articles about PPP loans,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1514560","1520240"," about Main Street, forgivable loans, all kinds of fucking money. Like this one guy, I was read"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1520240","1524480"," this one story this weekend. This guy had a sign on his restaurant that said,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1525200","1532240"," uh, something about no one wants to work. They all, everyone wants to get paid more than they're"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1532240","1538160"," worth and all these complaints, right? Shortage of workers and he's pissed off and he's blaming"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1538160","1544480"," Biden or whatever. But then you find out they came to light that this guy had owned a second"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1544480","1548160"," restaurant, right? He owned two restaurants. This is down in Atlanta, I think Georgia."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1549040","1559600"," And he had taken two fucking loans, forgivable. Two PPP loans for like a quarter million dollars"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1559600","1566240"," on each business. And he bought a fucking new house with cash. Who would fucking cash? Like a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1566240","1574800"," $350,000 house he bought from these two forgivable loans for his businesses. And so, you know, the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1574880","1580880"," one you got, you got people pointing a fucking finger, everybody's pointing a finger at poor"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1580880","1585360"," people and saying, you know, people that work for a living to make 20 bucks, 15 bucks, 30 bucks"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1585360","1591280"," an hour, whatever, right? And they're saying, you know, you shouldn't be demanding these things"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1591280","1598160"," and you're asking too much money and the rest of you don't want to work. But, you know, for the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1598160","1605840"," pennies that these poor people got during during COVID, if you if you look under the glass"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1605840","1610880"," closer, you find out that they were this is, you know, and this guy from Atlanta is probably"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1610880","1618320"," a small business owner. He's not the large companies that got even larger pay days. But the real"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1618320","1624560"," money that went into the system, it didn't go to poor people. It went to people with more money"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1624560","1630880"," than some schlep that's, you know, waiting tables or cooking in the fry at the fry cook or,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1632000","1636400"," you know, the guy that's trimming the weeds, they went to the guy that owned the landscape"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1636400","1642880"," business, they went to the fucking Disney World, it went to fucking, you know, a bank. It went to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1642880","1649120"," big sums. And so, you know, you did some of these stories you're hearing. It's weird. And then you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1649120","1653840"," got, you know, both these people pointing fingers at each other, you got the restaurant owner pointing"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1653920","1659520"," the finger at the worker and the worker pointing the finger at the restaurant owner. And I don't"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1659520","1664160"," really care about any of that. I just care about them that much money being in the system. So, you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1664160","1667600"," know, you've got this, you've got you actually got this restaurant owner that's got a fuck ton of"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1667600","1674960"," money that they wouldn't have normally had. And they bought a house. There's other issues too, but"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1676320","1680640"," there's so much fucking money in the system and they're still not going to take it out. And so,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1680640","1685760"," when they're bitching about inflation, it's, you know, to an extent, it's QT, right? It's probably"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1685760","1689360"," the best thing they can do to get the money out of the system."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1689360","1706640"," Yeah, it kept just that it was poor."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1706640","1719120"," I'm like, well, you know, like, let's be honest, like, let's be honest."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1721920","1726160"," We're talking, you know, we're talking wealthy rich, upper middle class."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1728160","1732320"," They got a lot of fucking money. And but it's funny that they're both pointing their fingers"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1732400","1736720"," at each other, but everybody got money. You know, they're all like, you, you, you, you, and it's"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1736720","1743360"," like, nah, it's fucking all of your got money. It's some of the biggest finger pointers got a lot"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1743360","1750000"," of that money. And they didn't all use it for the better, especially people that have money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1751280","1755120"," You could see it in this one restaurant. This guy was able to go out and buy a fucking $300"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1755200","1762720"," house, $350,000 house. I think it's called Arlington Cafe or something. It's, it's in,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1762720","1767120"," I think it's in Georgia, Arlington Cafe. And you know, they, of course, they dragged,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1767120","1771520"," they threatened the public dragged him into the mud and found out that he had gotten some pretty"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1771520","1776720"," fat checks and bought a fucking house. And yeah, I guess if that helps you, I don't have anything"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1776720","1782160"," problem with people having that one free paycheck or whatever. I actually don't. If it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1782240","1785920"," helped people out of how people get a leg up, I got no, I honestly don't have no fucking"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1785920","1788800"," problems with it because the ones that have problems with it, probably getting fucking more"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1788800","1793520"," than you were getting. Believe it or not behind the scenes, they don't think that you can find"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1793520","1800240"," out but you can, you can find out if they did get paid. I don't mind because if it stokes"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1800240","1805600"," economic development, if there's a class of people that use the money appropriately to,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1805600","1810480"," to better themselves or to start a business or to get into a home that they otherwise wouldn't"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1810480","1816720"," afford, wouldn't be able to afford them fine with that. But for the ones that are out there"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1816720","1822720"," fucking around with hookers and blow and all other stupid shit, pissing it away, there's ways to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1822720","1828080"," get that money away from them. You can raise taxes on mortgages, you can raise taxes on properties,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1828080","1832480"," you can rate, there's things that you can do to, to wean this money out of the system."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1833920","1838880"," And they're still not fucking doing it. So if they're still not going to fucking do it,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1838880","1850880"," the market should go up 30 to 34 to 30 on spaz."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1854240","1856080"," Squeeze up till close, King Crow's saying,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1860160","1865120"," who's upset about 15 bucks? Oh yeah, you know about this guy down in Arlington."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1866000","1872960"," And look, I'll be honest with you. I'll be honest with you like some of that whole anti-work thing"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1872960","1883280"," I'm not down with at all. Like I have got no sympathy. My dad was young. He moved us to a community"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1883280","1890240"," that was just coming up. Boston used to be a shithole, a fucking shithole. It was a fucking war zone."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1890240","1895040"," And of course it became expensive down years later when people, you know, people moved in"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1895280","1899840"," and turned that city into a nice place to live. And it took 10, 20 years for it to happen."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1900560","1905920"," So when I hear someone like bitching about, you know, can't afford to live in fucking Santa Monica,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1905920","1911600"," California or some shit, I can't afford a car in LA or some fucking nonsense like that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1911600","1918000"," They can't afford a fucking rent in LA. Like get fucked. Go find yourself some talent. Go to Wisconsin,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1918560","1924400"," go to Cleveland, go to fucking Detroit, go, there's places everywhere you can find across the country"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1924400","1930080"," that are looking for young people to help create a community, right? So I got no fucking sympathy"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1930080","1935840"," in that end. You don't have to join the military, but there are other ways to pay for college too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1935840","1941280"," And you don't have to go to the best fucking college. Matter of fact, like the UCLA, USC,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1941280","1946400"," you can go to their, they've got a two year college is there, you can get two to three years of your"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1946400","1952640"," college done dirt cheap if you're a resident, do your last year and a half or whatever at UCLA"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1952640","1957280"," and get a pretty fairly priced degree. There's some states you can go to like university in"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1957280","1962800"," Mexico. There's a bunch of different places that are reasonably priced. If you got good grades"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1962800","1968640"," and we need people to do, you know, we need people that want to be mechanics or be laborers or"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1969520","1974960"," people who want to do those things, they should get paid a living wage. But some of the argument"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1974960","1979600"," I'm not in agreement with fully. You know, I can't afford to live where my parents"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1980400","1985200"," turned houses into half million dollar homes. You don't have to go move somewhere where you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1985200","1990400"," can buy an affordable or cheap house by a hundred thousand dollar house, you know, and make that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1990400","1994800"," community better and make that community worth some money. That's part of the bootstrap stuff I"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","1994800","2000800"," do agree with. But I do agree that you should have health care and I do agree that you should have"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2000800","2006480"," a living wage and the insurance system here for even fucking auto insurance is fucked up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2007440","2014160"," And I don't think that students should have should have these absurd fucking loans that are"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2014160","2019360"," out there for them. I think some call you can get some college for free or close to free if you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2019360","2025280"," look for it or do certain things for it. But the way our college system was completely"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2025280","2035520"," fucking whack right now too. I agree with all that shit or do you like that that that aspect to it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2038000","2041360"," Right now there's fucking money floating around everywhere and they got to get the fuck on out."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2044320","2048400"," So you're not trying to but like that's what I'm doing because I'm I'm saying this and laughing"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2048400","2054880"," my ass off because I'm going down to the fucking the Home Depot and I'm like what the fuck? I got"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2054880","2061280"," to pay fucking $40 a sheet for fucking OBS. You got to be shitting me and that's what I'm doing."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2062640","2067600"," And that's what I'm doing right now. So maybe they maybe they maybe they text the companies of the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2067600","2072720"," lumber makers or the fucking the gas producers. Maybe they take it from all those people and they"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2072720","2076640"," they force them so they can't raise prices. I don't know where they get the money out of that system"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2076640","2082320"," but now they're sure as shit getting it out of my system. And of course I'm going to pass it along"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2082320","2086800"," to you know whoever I rent to right. The Airbnbers that I'm going to have in there I'm going to pass"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2086800","2091280"," all those costs on to them if it supports it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2100160","2108800"," Will I have no idea what you got timed out? I didn't time anybody out. I don't time anybody out."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2109440","2112640"," You might have you might have been timed out for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2116400","2119600"," maybe you said a word that YouTube timed you out for."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2123120","2125200"," Okay let's take it a massive Cleveland steamer."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2127920","2134400"," Yeah but Biden's speech is at 345. You told the wife that we're going to be frugal as fuck this"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","2187440","2190240"," something that I have to post. But other than that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2192640","2194480"," You're going to get 10 trades for me this year. They're"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2196400","2201120"," you know you're automatically assuming risks in this press secretary sake in the White"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","2232640","2237760"," the fucking JPM trade. I mean basically that's what it is. It's not it's not a caller but it's"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2237840","2245760"," one side of that caller. And it consistently makes money. It's not the it's not a it's not a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2248000","2252160"," you have to wait for it takes you know take usually takes a year for that trade to start"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","2258560","2264480"," money in the market so that when you're fucking around with me buying zero dates and you burn"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2264800","2268240"," two or three of them you're not crying and saying I have to go back for a job."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2269920","2273680"," So it shouldn't take it shouldn't take none but a year for you to make these trades."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","2331280","2334800"," with you know as you build your bank account if you've done building your account you just do"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2334800","2340320"," with like 10 percent and even if you blow it up one side of 10 times it's not going to fucking matter."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2342000","2343120"," It's not going to fucking matter."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","2642400","2647760"," All right. So we'll see here. We see. I don't know if I'm giving you identifying information"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2647760","2652240"," away or not. All right. Ready? So so this is the account that I set up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2654640","2660240"," and I set it up with see like skin the money off and I was like, oh, $895. I'm like,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2661040","2664480"," I'll I'll work it up to a thousand bucks for the trade for all these guys."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2668160","2674960"," So that's what I did. I went to 895 then I went to a thousand bucks and then I went to 1400"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2675760","2684240"," and then I went to 1464 and then I went to 1654. So this accounts already up almost 100%"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2685040","2691600"," with that's one, two, three, four, five. That's five trades."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2692320","2694160"," Not a single bad trade in there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2698880","2706960"," Not a single loser. So it's almost up 100%. It's up 86%. So they started that one."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2709440","2712080"," Now, this isn't the trade that we're doing that we you and I are doing."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2712800","2716080"," I'll probably have to I'll take the other I'll take the other 700 bucks out of there or some."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2718240","2724240"," So it'll be a flat thousand. So of course, I'm dicking around in this account, which I shouldn't"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2724240","2733520"," be. I'm running different different different strategies. But it's almost 100% already. So"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2735440","2741600"," if I'm taking these risky trades here, I'm going to show you 10 trades that are not risky at all."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2742560","2745840"," Uh, way less riskier than these trades."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2747600","2753120"," And so that's 86% right. So if you had $100,000, you have $186,000. If you had $100,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2753120","2754640"," you have $186."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2765200","2765920"," You guys are funny."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2772720","2780080"," Yeah, so the this is the trade. Okay, is that you're"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2782080","2788400"," the trade is the or the the contest is how do you turn a thousand dollars in 10 trades, I think,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2788400","2794560"," into a million dollars. I think that's what it is. So you make you make 10 100% trades in a row"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2795200","2797600"," and you go 100% in all 10 times."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2800240","2807680"," So these are the safest trades you can make. Some of the safest options trades, you can make"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2807680","2813520"," 400% profit, not for your 10, 20% selling calls, selling puts kind of shit, fucking butterflies,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2813520","2819680"," selling fucking butterflies and condors. There's just basic safe calendar spreads"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2820480","2827040"," that market liquidation moments. It's how I fund myself to trade consistently."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2828960","2831760"," Jesus Christ, I got like 9,000 text messages."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2835680","2838480"," But it's how I can, you know, it's how I consistently have money. So when you're like,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2838480","2840080"," hey, cap, how are you taking all these trades?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2842880","2845520"," This is the system that I use to make consistent money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2846240","2850160"," So that you can follow along with this system."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2852000","2855840"," You shouldn't do 100%. You should do like 10% of your your bank or something."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2856640","2860880"," Well, if you're trying to build a bank or not work anymore, yeah, you do it, you know, 100% 100%."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2868240","2872080"," But you just see you guys can consistently know how to make,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2873040","2875840"," I mean, how many of you guys make five straight trades with no losers?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2877280","2881200"," I'm going to bet that it's a very small percentage. So"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2884080","2886960"," they consistently make a winning trade where you take your money and you run,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2887760","2892960"," you do it again and again and again and again. You get good at taking trades that are winners."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2892960","2897520"," The more winning trades you take, the better trader you become, the better investor that you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2897520","2902080"," become. You can start to hone in on your craft on your skill."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2905360","2909040"," What makes, you know, makes you successful. Even if you have that one bad trade to blow up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2909040","2914480"," an account, that kind of stuff, that's fine. But there are ways for you to make consistent money,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2914480","2920320"," not just buying stock and hoping and praying that it comes back one day,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2920320","2921920"," or the market comes back one day."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2921920","2929680"," Yeah, as a matter of fact, yeah, that's a higher return than I thought."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2929680","2933120"," Yeah, let's just say some some stocks. I think about some stocks that are up 86%"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2934000","2936960"," on the year right now or in the past month, not many."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2940320","2946080"," So the trading handle is Captain's trades. It's a private handle. You just follow it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2947440","2951040"," And what you'll get in there, I posted the rules in there. You can see the rules,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2951040","2956880"," go to my profile. You see the rules that I posted. The rules that I set for myself and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2959920","2965360"," the risks associated, but nothing else. And every time I place one of those trades,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2967120","2971600"," you'll get a post with like an alert and like an alert that you can actually see the ones"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2971600","2976080"," that piss people off. But you'll only get them when it plays straight. So you see 10 of them,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2976080","2982000"," typically about 10 of them in a year. And you'll see the alert saying,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2982000","2987120"," it's about we're getting close right next this morning or this afternoon or the next day,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2987120","2991600"," I'll be taking that trade and I'll be live streaming it. And then I'll place the trades on"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2991600","2996960"," Roberthood because I know that a lot of you guys out there are new traders. This isn't meant for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","2996960","3002720"," like an old time. If you've been trading 5, 10, 12 years, 20 years, you don't need this. You"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3002720","3011760"," found a way to make money in this market, for sure. But if you consistently lose money or"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3011760","3018400"," consistently don't make money or want a tool that you can fucking dumb down as a dumb trader,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3018400","3022640"," we got lots of sellers moving in the market right now. I'm trying to push this below 440."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3023920","3028240"," We'll see if they can break it, have a little bit more support here at 439 as well."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3029120","3033680"," We'll take a look and see if they can break through. A lot of support in here right now,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3033680","3042080"," but the sellers are trying to make that push lower. But I want you to be able to have a tool"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3042080","3046960"," in your chest that you can say, I know I can consistently make money if I do this every month"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3046960","3053280"," to three months. I know that I can make this money so that I can go fuck off and buy some"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3053760","3060240"," shitbox company, some shit stonk that you know is going up. You have a consistent way to make"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3060240","3069520"," consistent money trading the S&P 500. You just trade the S&P 500. Trust me, you could do this"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3069520","3075040"," trading futures. This applies to futures as well. This same tool applies to futures,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3075680","3080960"," though I do recommend that you do this with cash market and then you take that cash and you run"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3080960","3087280"," over and buy your fucking me minis for your fucking hundred-dollar days on futures or your"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3087280","3091280"," four hundred-dollar days over in fucking days that you do with your better taxes and all that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3091280","3099600"," other stupid shit. This is a way for you to make consistent money. It works nine out of 10 times"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3099600","3103360"," usually. You can get 10 out of 10. It's going to be hard to get 10 out of 10. I'm probably going to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3103360","3112160"," give it like a, I'll give it a 60 to 70 percent chance that it works. It's got high odds. The"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3112160","3120320"," trade is not that complicated. You'd really have to fuck it up to get the trade wrong. The problem"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3120320","3126240"," is it's patience. You miss some really kick-ass trades when you're doing it. But the key is"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3126960","3132800"," that that little bit of risk that's there in the market when you're like, I know we're going up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3132800","3137200"," right now. Even if the market hasn't liquidated. I know the market's going up. I should just take"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3137200","3142640"," this trade. We're not taking any of those. We're taking, this is a tool. This is one that you know"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3142640","3147360"," that you always come back to. If you do it 10 times and you see the power of it, you'll always be"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3147360","3152720"," looking for it every month, month and a half. You're going to be looking for that trade and you know"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3152720","3160880"," with, when you hear, sometimes on social media, sometimes in social media you'll hear people say,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3160880","3166800"," when people know the trade's going to work, they go all in. Like long-time traders, they go"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3166800","3176000"," balls deep all in. This is that same system. This is that system that you hear about."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3176800","3181040"," Or one of those systems, right? When you're like, I know traders that go in with a million"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3181040","3185280"," dollars and they short the market and they make enough money. They'll do shit for a month and a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3185280","3190160"," half. This is one of those. This is that kind of a trade. So I'll do it live with you once or not"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3190160","3196000"," once, 10 times for one year. And then if you follow along, I'll meet you in Vegas when it's done."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3197760","3206800"," And we're breaking through right now that small area, retesting the lows here,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3208720","3214240"," breaking through, looking for that 440 break. If we can get that break at 440 or if we get the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3214320","3217760"," squeeze higher, if there's some profit taking down below, we'll take a look."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3226240","3234080"," Yeah, it's called, I think it's called Captain's Trades. Like C-A-P-T-A-I-N-S-T-R-A-D-E-S."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3235520","3242400"," Captain's Trades. That's a one-time thing. You guys, it'll be one time I only do, well,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3242400","3247280"," not one, but I'm going to do this once. Any of you that have followed me since the beginning,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3247280","3250240"," any of you that have found me to this point right here,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3254720","3260800"," we'll do it. I don't want to talk about it now, but there's a whole bunch of other stuff that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3260800","3263680"," you guys are waiting to see. Any of you guys are new traders out there, you're going to wait"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3263680","3270320"," and see because the panic is wild. You'll actually stop day trading when you're doing this stuff."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3270320","3277120"," If you do it real, if you follow me, it'll consume you when you're taking these trades."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3278000","3282240"," I remember when I first started trading large amounts of money, it consumed me. I couldn't get"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3282240","3287040"," over it, right? You have to get over each one of those humps until you stop panicking, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3287040","3290960"," Then you're like, I can fucking, I can piss away 50 grand today, fuck it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3293200","3295920"," I can burn $50,000, just don't tell my friends."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3296800","3303120"," Like the normies, normal people, they make that in a year. You can't tell those people"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3304640","3311440"," because they won't understand. Here we go. We got that cash gap, a cap fill coming in from"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3311440","3317600"," yesterday on the spy right now. Markets selling down, testing the lows on session."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3318400","3326640"," Still got down here, this little bit of support. Any bit of some support here, 440,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3326640","3333520"," 439. You might be able to hold on to those short down here to 439. See the buyers are slipping"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3333520","3338080"," away a little bit here. We're 45 minutes or so to the close of pit trading and energy markets for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3338080","3343840"," the day. WTI crude futures at $100.28, up six bucks or five and a third percent. Be careful of"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3343840","3348240"," shorts closing their positions here as well. If you're short here, don't get caught if you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3348240","3356320"," see a spring higher. Give me a second. Everybody put a trade on."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3360240","3363680"," Oh, yeah. Look at those. Nice and cheap."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3364640","3379440"," Nice do or die moment. Nice cash gap fill closing it out. Gap has been filled."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","3421760","3422800"," back to the beginning here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3423520","3446320"," See that nice little touchdown here. 440 flat, 439. You want to be looking on the right hand"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3446320","3452080"," side here at the buyers. You don't want to see like, you want to see like 50,000 buyers, 100,000"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3452080","3458880"," buyers swooping in. You want to see this. You want to see the buyers swoop in here to try"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3458880","3465920"," to consume these sellers. Let's see if we can get this whole one here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3465920","3477840"," Keep a close side down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3482400","3487920"," See if there's a break or if we have more buyers down below at 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3487920","3503840"," Yeah, I'm looking at the 445s. I'm looking at the April 13, 445 Cs right now. They're down to 50 cents."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3505040","3514080"," I've got a couple racks on hold here. I want to see if we have a snapback real quick here or if we"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3514080","3527200"," break through. You'll see a rug pull down here. Watch my cursor down here. You'll see a rug pull"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3527840","3534720"," down here or you'll see a wave of buyers step in. Just watching real time seeing what happens."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3534720","3538160"," Looks like the smart money is down here at 438. So we'll wait for that as well."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3538880","3543360"," Wait, see if we can get down to 438. So I'm going to cheat. If you guys ever try to buy dips,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3545280","3549440"," you're like, I bought the dip and then it kept dipping. This is why we watch,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3549440","3560240"," this is why we watch BookMap. Let's see where the real dip is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3560240","3570080"," Yeah, so that's what we do. We're going to learn how to consistently make money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3570080","3576240"," We're going to learn how to stop working a regular job. We're going to learn how to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3576240","3585440"," take old fat white guys fucking fat greasy hands so that so that you guys can stop"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3585440","3587760"," fucking working your regular jobs."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","3604480","3612720"," Just have a break now, 440. Zero. Next price target, 4390 and then 4300."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3613120","3619760"," It's a nice steep drop off here too. Got a nice clean full 10 points here, another clean full 10"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3619760","3627760"," points below."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3628320","3630320"," You"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","3678960","3688880"," Just keep this up here right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3696480","3701920"," Looks like some of these buyers are stepping up to 439 from 438 earlier."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3708960","3727920"," I've got my finger on the trigger."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3738960","3756080"," You don't have to say no money. You guys don't have to tip me. Don't worry about it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3756080","3759760"," We're going to do I'm doing this because I feel like I owe it as a trader, as an investor."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3761360","3765600"," I have like this, you know, like, I have my dad and my husband, that kind of shit."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3766560","3770640"," What do you like? Take care of people or whatever. That's my kind of personality."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3771680","3775440"," So you don't know me no money or nothing like that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3778880","3782080"," You'll have more than the green week. Just don't spend the fucking money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3782720","3785600"," Like make a bank. Keep your job. Make a bank."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","3804640","3808720"," There's not a lot of people out there. I know there's a lot of you like the between the social"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3808720","3814560"," media, the noise that you hear out there that you can get caught up. You guys, I see you guys"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3814560","3818000"," all over Twitter fucking getting caught up in the news. You get caught up in the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3819920","3826560"," like, there's so much noise. And then if you dial out all that noise, you push all the noise away."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3826560","3830880"," It's the coast, March same store, sales rose by 8.8% year over year. It's from Mexico."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3832880","3837200"," Then you'll end up knowing what to look for for the right moment to go long, go short down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3837200","3839440"," from the 11.7% growth scene in February."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3839440","3849840"," And I think that was last week, right? I think I made that money last this past week. I think"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3849840","3855520"," those are five trades this past week that I made or two weeks a week or two. That's a thousand"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3855520","3857040"," bucks. Make a thousand bucks a week. It's pretty good."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3860480","3862320"," Fucking dickin' around with a Robinhood account."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3864560","3868320"," I don't know how the fuck you guys trade Robinhood. Oh, that's the other thing. You guys won't get"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3868320","3874160"," day trades. Keep that account separate so you're not getting day trade flags."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3874800","3876800"," Not getting flagged for day trades and that kind of stuff."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3878000","3880720"," Keep it separate. Don't look at it. Don't fuck with it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3883280","3884240"," Just leave the money there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3888000","3892320"," But I don't know how you trade that shit either. I was like running through some"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3892320","3897280"," trades and you can't trade on Robinhood like zero dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3898880","3906080"," And you guys can't like close trades between spy between four and four 15, which was shocking."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3906640","3910480"," Like this is a whole bunch of shit you can't do in Robinhood. It's a shitty fucking app."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3911840","3914880"," Like Robinhood's probably the shittiest fucking app out there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3916080","3920240"," I was like, fuck. I was like, that fucking thing is built to take your money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3921120","3923120"," It really is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3925200","3932080"," So you'll make this money and then we'll send you to a legit"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3934960","3939200"," broker by the time you're done. See, you're not trading on Robinhood."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3939200","3943040"," I was like, what the fuck is with this fucking..."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3944160","3948880"," Like, I can't even begin to tell you. The whole thing is set up for you to fail."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3951120","3955120"," If you're a brand new trader, that should have built to take your money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3957120","3963360"," And fuck the PDT rules are built to take your money too, but you've got like the PDT rules"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3963920","3967360"," fucking with your brain, right? I can't get out of a trade right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3968000","3974880"," If I break the PDT rules, I can't trade anymore. That's all bullshit too, but we'll talk about that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3974880","3976320"," We have talked about it on stream before."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3977280","3981920"," But I can't believe that it's legal. I can't believe Robinhood is legal."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3985520","3987680"," That thing is fucking built to take all your money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3990080","3994800"," Right down here, now down looking at $4.39."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","3998320","4001920"," Those buyers are stepping back in again at $4.38."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4001920","4006160"," I still haven't taken a trade long here yet."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4008400","4011920"," So I haven't bought the dip and then it kept dipping."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4022160","4026720"," Yeah, of course, just a request. And I'll blow through them and find out who you are."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4026720","4028800"," Chansu, I know you, man. You're fucking your in, bro."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4028800","4041360"," Yes, I, my favorite, currently my favorite, Tasty is fucking clunky as fuck."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4042880","4050560"," But it's the best, it's the best support I've ever had. Hands down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4051520","4057760"," It's the best support. I've had the best experience with, with support."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4057760","4062640"," I have a whole litany. I have to do videos in this shit because I talk about it all the time, but I never."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4064160","4068000"," Like you want to buy your stock with a bank, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4068000","4073520"," And March monthly budget statement at a deficit of $192.7 billion wider than the $190.9 billion"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4074000","4081040"," previously receipts were up 18% to $350 billion outlays at $508 billion. We're down 45%"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4083040","4087440"," trading in the lows of the day, also releasing minutes of their discount rate meeting."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4089280","4093680"," I think to me, Tasty is clunky. I don't fucking like, I've got thicker swim too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4097520","4100320"," I feel like I spend more time on the thicker swim fucking website,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4100320","4103040"," dicking around than I do with actually fucking trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4103040","4107120"," Now, as a New York Fed director saw a half point discount rate hike at the latest meeting,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4108000","4111600"," other 10 other regional saw at the quarter point discount rate hike I've seen."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4113840","4118560"," But the one of the best, well, I like Tasty is I can place complex trades and cut legs off,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4119360","4123760"," add legs on whenever I fucking feel like it. That's one of the best part. That's,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4123760","4128560"," that's the second best part about Tasty. And then the best part though is the fucking customer"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4128560","4134800"," service there is fucking outstanding. But don't ever buy stock through them either."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4134800","4136720"," If you're gonna buy stock buy it through a fucking bank,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4138880","4144640"," like Schwab or some shit like that, Fidelity, whatever you want to trade with. So don't get fucked over."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4148800","4150960"," So they don't put you on closing trades only."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4150960","4160880"," But I've had like, I've had, well, there we go. I like that right there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4163680","4169360"," Oh, yeah. Give me that snapback trade, baby. I'm getting close."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4169360","4174080"," Where is that snapback trade?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4183120","4184480"," That's that snapback trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4189840","4192080"," There it is right down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4200240","4203840"," That's snapback. What is that price down there? 439."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4206480","4208080"," That's that back trade right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4208080","4222560"," What's up to a two dollars and 44 cents on 440Ps."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4231440","4233360"," Talked about not liking the long trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4233680","4238560"," But the setup was great, but I was fucking suspect of it. And sure enough,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4242080","4245520"," it traded down. Didn't lose my ass."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4248960","4253200"," Here goes that snapback trade, baby. That little push down below here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4255200","4258960"," Still more sellers above here. Take a look at it better."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4263360","4268640"," I'm just here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4273040","4274400"," Is that fucking snapback?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4283280","4285840"," Still some buyers sitting down here at 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4288480","4289760"," Still waiting down below."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4294320","4302720"," Yeah, I think I want to say customer service, hands down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4303360","4308240"," I was fucking trading at a ski resort out in Colorado and fucking"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4310640","4313920"," internet went down or some fucking nonsense, lost like 15 grand."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4316160","4317120"," Gave me my money back."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4317760","4323360"," Okay, if there's one company, I've had nothing but fucking baller customer service."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4323360","4334880"," Tasty works. There we go. There we go. There we go. Nice bounce."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4341200","4345920"," Yeah, you guys, you got that put spreads of balls or fucking love put spreads."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4347120","4354400"," I love call spreads, put spreads."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4356960","4357280"," Huh?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4360640","4361840"," I fucking love spreads."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4368640","4369520"," I fucking love them."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4377120","4379120"," I fucking love them."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4389040","4390080"," Mm-hmm."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4394560","4395040"," Oh."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4467120","4488500"," See this area here, 442, 441, 60, 440 starts down here at 440, 60, but the big sellers"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4488500","4502800"," are right here at 442, so we'll take a look."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4502800","4527800"," Look for some resistance here, and then right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4527800","4543800"," It's not the SEC, reportedly adding 12 more Chinese firms listed in the US to their HFCAA"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4543800","4544800"," list."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4544800","4545800"," So who.com?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4545800","4550800"," Well, there's no medical resource among the firms being added to the HFCAA list."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4550800","4555800"," 444's were down to 29 cents down now up to 46 cents."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4575800","4601800"," So, we'll take a look at the HFCAA list."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4601800","4625800"," All right, so let's have a quick talk."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4625800","4630800"," So a quick talk about what I said this morning."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4630800","4637800"," Let's review this morning about what I said."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4637800","4638800"," Let's review this morning."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4638800","4644800"," Let's go back over this morning."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4644800","4649800"," All right."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4649800","4652800"," Same chart that's been up for a fucking week and a half, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4652800","4658800"," So we talked this morning about, we bought this down here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4658800","4661800"," Beautiful, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4661800","4664800"," Took profit here this morning, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4664800","4667800"," Gorgeous move."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4667800","4670800"," Talked about the two places to short."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4670800","4673800"," Here is one, and here is two, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4673800","4681800"," That you should get one opportunity to short, and then a second opportunity to short here,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4681800","4684800"," right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4684800","4689800"," Now, hold on here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4689800","4694800"," Now, I said to you this morning before the open, I said if we sell the bell, right,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4694800","4698800"," to expect another retest a pie here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4698800","4699800"," Which we got?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4699800","4702800"," We got our retest above, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4702800","4705800"," And there's a start to trade down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4705800","4708800"," I told you I'd like to buy one of these dips, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4708800","4715800"," One, two, three, one, two, and three for a move higher."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4715800","4719800"," And then I started talking to you about by Biden over there, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4719800","4722800"," I'm like, yeah, I'm not really feeling this fucking Biden guy."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4722800","4724800"," I think in here I was like, it's coiling, it's coiling, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4724800","4726800"," What would I do here?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4726800","4730800"," And I said, yeah, I don't really like that trade, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4730800","4733800"," That's all on here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4733800","4739800"," Bring that back over there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4739800","4743800"," And we started, going down here, we're like, what's going to actually take?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4743800","4749800"," Matter of fact, even this part of the move right here, I talked to you about how it looks"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4749800","4750800"," like it's going to go down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4750800","4754800"," I showed you earlier and said, we're going to either squeeze higher or we're going to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4754800","4756800"," squeeze lower, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4756800","4760800"," So we're coiling to that effect and you had asked me what my opinion was, what we were"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4760800","4761800"," going to do here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4761800","4763800"," My opinion was that we were going down, if you remember, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4763800","4765800"," So it went down over here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4765800","4769800"," Check central bank governor Ross Knox saying the central bank is cautious with further"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4769800","4772800"," rate increases."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4772800","4773800"," We broke."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4773800","4778800"," We had the discussion about this bull flag here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4778800","4781800"," And I said, sometimes a bull flag will present itself, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4781800","4784800"," And you would take that trade right there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4784800","4787800"," And I said, this is why we have book map, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4787800","4789800"," And it doesn't look like it's actually going to squeeze higher."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4789800","4791800"," It looks like it's going to fall off, which it did."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4791800","4797800"," Now, that other conversation we had this morning was, once we retest this high here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4797800","4803800"," That I would like to see us come down to S1 to then get to 450."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4803800","4808800"," And so that's what we're at right now is, are we going to test S1, which we just did, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4808800","4811800"," This is S1 here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4811800","4813800"," So we're going to get rid of this."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4813800","4815800"," We're sitting here on S1 right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4815800","4822800"," The question becomes, do we sell down to S2, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4822800","4823800"," Here's S1."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4823800","4826800"," This is support one and support two down below."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4826800","4829800"," We're going to look for this lower target today or into tomorrow."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4829800","4840800"," From Ross Knox saying that in second half inflation should return to single digit pace."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4840800","4844800"," So the question becomes here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4844800","4846800"," Was this all the profit taking?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4846800","4853800"," Is everyone committed for us to go down and tag this S2, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4853800","4860800"," And we know we keep hearing me harping and harping on the JPM caller that's down here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4860800","4865800"," You guys know they're talking about the JPM caller up here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4865800","4867800"," I'd really like to see this get done, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4867800","4870800"," We get done with this JPM caller and we're out of here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4870800","4873800"," We're going north."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4873800","4878800"," But with that bullish statement this morning, I'm thinking that we're going to come down here,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4878800","4880800"," take profit and come back up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4880800","4883800"," This is my theory, right, is that we come down here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4883800","4886800"," We come higher here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4886800","4889800"," And into Friday, we actually come down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4889800","4891800"," We take profit at some point."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4891800","4894800"," So I don't really know where we are at this point right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4894800","4897800"," I want to see the buyers step in."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4897800","4903800"," If the buyers can't step in here, shorts don't get closed here, then we can break through, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4903800","4909800"," We can actually break through now, come back up and even continue even lower, believe it or not,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4909800","4912800"," if we start to see rolling put flow."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4912800","4918800"," So if you're looking, you want to be looking for that rolling put flow and hedging down deeper, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4918800","4923800"," Because we know we can't go deeper without there being puts below 431."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4923800","4929800"," We need to see puts down at 420, 410 for us to actually trade down to 420, 410."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4929800","4933800"," If we don't see those puts there, we have what's called a put wall, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4933800","4936800"," If it stops us from going any deeper down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4936800","4940800"," So we're going to have to start looking for that, for where we are currently,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4940800","4945800"," see if we can get more puts down below 420."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4945800","4947800"," And I'm looking for them right now, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4947800","4953800"," On April 13th, I'm not seeing shit down there at 420 for April 13th."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4953800","4957800"," I'm not seeing shit down there for 420s."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4957800","4960800"," I'm seeing everything's just zero dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4960800","4963800"," Even Friday, I see nothing down there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4963800","4965800"," I see a little bit at 420, believe it or not."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4965800","4971800"," I do see some 420 peas for 12 cents for expiration on Friday."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4972800","4976800"," I see just 440 peas for the 14th."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4976800","4983800"," So we're going to have to keep an eye out for if we see those puts come into the market."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4983800","4984800"," Let's see here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4984800","4987800"," Hold on."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4987800","4993800"," Let me take a look for Monday's expiry too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4993800","4996800"," I'm seeing calls for Monday for 445."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","4997800","5006800"," The central bank governor was not saying that some moderate increase in rates is likely."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5006800","5016800"," And we know that ultimately, my position is bearish."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5016800","5019800"," So we know that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5019800","5025800"," Let's take a look at ES real quick."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5026800","5051800"," Roosnock goes on and say that they will be waiting for new data and new staff forecast."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5051800","5064800"," Let's take a look at the load up here for a second."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5064800","5065800"," It's interesting."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5065800","5071800"," I'm looking at the candle on the daily candle on the ES."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5071800","5076800"," This is the indecision candle."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5076800","5085800"," So let's bring the market breadth indicator up, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5085800","5089800"," Move this down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5089800","5091800"," This is the market breadth indicator on the ES."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5091800","5092800"," We could have used SPX."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5092800","5094800"," It doesn't really matter."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5094800","5100800"," What does matter, what helps here to take a peek at is follow my cursor down to the bottom right-hand"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5100800","5101800"," side, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5101800","5104800"," We could continue to see the market rolling over, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5104800","5106800"," Which is what we want to see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5106800","5113800"," We want to see the rotation, but also the breadth continue to go down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5113800","5122800"," If you look here at 45.9 or 603, 54.8% bullish, but the key number down here is 45.9."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5122800","5126800"," And we should continue to head lower here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5126800","5130800"," We always see how this market rolls over in past time, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5130800","5131800"," Price doesn't matter."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5131800","5136800"," What matters is we end up getting that steepening of market capitulation at some point."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5136800","5142800"," There's a little bit of a pick up here at the moment, but we really want to see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5142800","5144800"," See this white line right here?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5144800","5150800"," We really want to see this white line somewhere down here around 218, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5150800","5152800"," We still have a ways to go."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5152800","5154800"," We're at 603 right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5154800","5156800"," 210 is really, really where we want to be."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5156800","5159800"," So we've got still have some time on our hands."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5159800","5166800"," Before we're at that market capitulation, we still have some ways to go right now, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5166800","5169800"," We know that we came down here from 4630."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5169800","5171800"," We've got 4400."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5171800","5178800"," This seems like it could get us down to this 4000 level that we could trade down eventually"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5178800","5180800"," into this level down here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5180800","5187800"," We'll probably have a test here, but eventually to meet up with that 4000 down below."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5187800","5192800"," Let's see here, put that away."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5192800","5194800"," So we're still waiting here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5194800","5198800"," Still waiting for our trending lower here and towards the final 90 minutes of trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5198800","5203800"," The S&P futures at $43.96 down 12 and a half handles."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5203800","5205800"," The Dow was down about 90 points."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5205800","5209800"," We've seen a give back of all the earlier gains for US equity markets outside of the Russell"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5209800","5212800"," thousand, which just stole up about half a percent."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5212800","5214800"," Straight up more than 2% in the early going."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5214800","5221800"," Who is that?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5221800","5226800"," Oh, yeah."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5226800","5228800"," 210 years spread."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","5255800","5269800"," GPM collar trade down below here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5269800","5275800"," Right there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5275800","5295800"," Put that back over."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5295800","5311800"," Let's see if we can tag that 433 in the bell."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5311800","5314800"," There it is right down there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5314800","5317800"," That's that JPM collar trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5317800","5319800"," I've got it tagged at 434."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5319800","5321800"," Well, this is what it is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5321800","5326800"," The put spread is at 434.0."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5326800","5332800"," It looks like the buyers are down at 4330."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5332800","5343800"," Watching puts coming on Kweb somewhere was asking about Baba this morning."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5343800","5350800"," It trades right alongside Baba."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","5380800","5394800"," Still has some room to get down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5394800","5402800"," These 50s down here look good at 438, but still has room to get down at 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5402800","5424800"," I don't know if we get there, but still a little bit of room at 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5424800","5431800"," We'll look and see why we've got a current order book."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5431800","5459800"," Let me figure it out."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5459800","5468800"," The trade on Facebook is 520-220C."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5468800","5482800"," We'll add 6 hours."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5482800","5510800"," Decent algo score, but not a kickass algo score."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5510800","5539800"," Straight plunge down from 221-210."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5539800","5568800"," It's totally fucking looks like it can keep going down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5568800","5575800"," It doesn't actually like that trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5598800","5611800"," It's such a fucked up thing."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5611800","5626800"," I'm looking at Facebook right now and I'm like, man."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","5661800","5665800"," It's like current Rock Bottom is 180."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5665800","5671800"," I got tagged all the way down to 130."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5671800","5678800"," My assumption is that this is where the first dip bot was at 180."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5678800","5683800"," This is where the original buy-in was."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5683800","5688800"," It looks like it was at 184-60, so somewhere in here they want to save their asses."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5688800","5691800"," Keep an eye on that trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5691800","5705800"," What I want you to do is charting software."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5705800","5711800"," Create an alert at 185."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5711800","5717800"," Create an alert at 185 or so."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5718800","5721800"," Track that trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5721800","5727800"," If that trade is still on and it's down at 184, that's a fucking buy."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5727800","5735800"," We'll set it later when you guys aren't looking."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5735800","5744800"," Maybe set another one at 200, flat even, 200, set another alert here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5744800","5746800"," See if there's still in this trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5746800","5754800"," The trade for Facebook is May 20th 220C for $7.3 million."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5754800","5757800"," See if they roll it or keep it if it trades down in here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5757800","5766800"," If they stay in it, maybe for a good earnings play, believe it or not."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5766800","5773800"," I actually like the Facebook earnings play."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5774800","5776800"," But I don't like buying that trade right where it's at."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5776800","5779800"," I think it can still fucking come down."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5779800","5783800"," Here's the target, 200, and this 210 is another place."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5783800","5800800"," There's a small one here at 210, but 200 is juicy."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","5820800","5829800"," I'll be looking for one here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5829800","5833800"," I want to see that collar down here at 433."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5833800","5837800"," To be honest with you, the collar is at 434."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5837800","5840800"," The support is at 433."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5840800","5847800"," I'd like to see that trade all the way down to 433."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","5847800","5852800"," Let's take a look and see if it's still there or if we're going to snap back here."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","6354800","6361800"," Let's see if we can find it better."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6361800","6371800"," Just 442. Come back to VWAP. Get fucked out of that one."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6391800","6405800"," 439. 20. Let's close."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6405800","6426800"," 920."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6426800","6432800"," I don't think it trades back up here to 440."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6432800","6440800"," Maybe."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6440800","6443800"," Let's see it up in here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6443800","6446800"," The wall is at 439.20 or so."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6446800","6449800"," It supports down below here right at 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6449800","6456800"," We want to see it as a rug pull."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6479800","6493800"," I'm not looking for long the market until the market rolls over."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6493800","6502800"," Until I see capitulation, I'm not looking for zero dates or something like that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6502800","6517800"," But other than that, I'm not looking to touch like buying calls here or anything like that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6518800","6523800"," Because of where we are, I'd like to see us trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6523800","6544800"," I'd like to buy another set of puts here and have it fucking come up and then trade down into the bell."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6544800","6550800"," I'm going to wait to see if I can get another set up here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6550800","6552800"," I'm going to look here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6552800","6558800"," There's some resistance that like 440, 440.50 cents somewhere in here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6558800","6562800"," We'll see if this springs up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6562800","6565800"," But it could roll over right away."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6565800","6573800"," I'm out again. I'm just flat right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6573800","6577800"," But we're already down here right? We've broken through 440."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6577800","6580800"," We won't retest it. This isn't really a retest here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6580800","6583800"," We'll retest this at some point."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6583800","6586800"," But I would really like to see us just go down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6586800","6590800"," Now, the question is, do you buy... because I know JPM said something about... not JPM,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6590800","6596800"," SG said something about that the roll off on Friday should stabilize prices."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6596800","6597800"," We should trade higher."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6597800","6600800"," You still want to be paying attention to put flow coming in."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6600800","6603800"," And then, of course, market breadth."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6603800","6617800"," And if we see rolling hedges or put flow on top of hedge flow into Friday for lower prices down to 400."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6617800","6621800"," I'm interested at this 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6621800","6622800"," It wasn't expected."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6622800","6626800"," We saw the 430 and then we saw the 439 and 440... or excuse me."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6626800","6631800"," We saw 440 and then we saw 439 and 438 for a quick 20 points."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6631800","6636800"," But I find it odd that it's sitting here at 438."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6636800","6639800"," I'm kind of like, ahh, it doesn't sound right."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6639800","6641800"," Like, 440 sounds right."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6641800","6645800"," 4 fucking 33 sounds right down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6645800","6651800"," But this is just hanging out at 4 fucking 38 dozen."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6652800","6657800"," And I ain't buying fucking... I ain't buying Biden fucking price control in it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6657800","6659800"," Fucking 345, either."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6659800","6663800"," And that's what instituted all of this was Wends Biden's speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6663800","6666800"," I guess we usually get a nice pump from Biden's speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6666800","6672800"," But the fact that it's at 345 in the afternoon, the fact that he's going to be late after the bell,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6672800","6675800"," brings volatility until speech, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6675800","6680800"," So we're trading down into at least the 345 hour unless he gets pushed."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6686800","6689800"," Now there's only... there's 217,000 puts now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6689800","6694800"," It's back up to about three bucks a put 440 P."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6695800","6712800"," Take note too that VIX is trading up to the previous eye of $24.94 on February 11th yesterday at 4 p.m."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6712800","6716800"," Going back to retest the high again."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6716800","6719800"," $24.94."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6725800","6734800"," If you get that nice push up, it could send us down to that 433 down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6734800","6758800"," $4.39.66."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6758800","6763800"," Pentagon officials saying that they believe China and Russia continue to seek weapons to hit U.S."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6763800","6771800"," satellites and that space debris risk is growing at the Defense Intelligence Agency."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6793800","6805800"," They look at the U.S. yield curve here with about 15 minutes to go before the blows of pitch rating."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6805800","6811800"," We're seeing some selling in the 30 in the 20 year, while the 10 year trade's higher by nearly half a point."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6811800","6819800"," And that 210 spread has widened by about five basis points with a two year yield following a 2.39% today."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6823800","6837800"," Let me just second."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6837800","6846800"," Looking at TLT."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6846800","6852800"," TLT sold off and there's a bid on April 14th."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6852800","6864800"," 124 C for 51 cents."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6865800","6877800"," There's also a bid on April 22nd for 127 C for 44 cents and 130 C for 13 cents April 22nd."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6877800","6879800"," Kind of pissed at myself."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6879800","6893800"," I didn't want to track it this morning and see if anybody was buying them today based on that Biden speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6894800","6900800"," I think I might place a trade on."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6900800","6910800"," I might take the one I don't know if I want to take the 130 C's."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6910800","6921800"," So fucking like such pain in the ass trading to you every time I trade TLT it's like you got to buy him like a fucking month and a half out."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6921800","6923800"," It runs so slow."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6923800","6929800"," It's old man trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6929800","6935800"," But I do kind of like the idea of the April 22nd."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6935800","6939800"," Now there's a bunch of interest on 130 C. I don't know if they're getting that shit."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6939800","6945800"," But like 127 for April 22nd is nice is a nice trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6969800","6993800"," It's a nice trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","6993800","7000800"," I'm stepping in right now on the spot."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7023800","7037800"," That retest the lows at the cash close at 410."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7037800","7066800"," From yesterday."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7066800","7076800"," Such a wonky ass place."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7096800","7125800"," Oh yeah."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7125800","7127800"," You can do that twice a year, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7127800","7129800"," That's a gangster."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7129800","7136800"," The interest rate related news got a treasury price in I bonds and 9.6% interest."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7136800","7138800"," I thought you could buy it twice."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7138800","7145800"," I thought it was 10k twice per year per person on those I bonds."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7145800","7172800"," I got a couple days ago."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7172800","7175800"," How is the hero so positive with where we're at?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7175800","7178800"," Good question Zach."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7178800","7184800"," So we have rotation or not rotation we've got."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7184800","7189800"," We've got dip buyers stepping in right now, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7189800","7194800"," And put sellers and call buyers right now where we are."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7194800","7201800"," And we have real money selling in the market."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7201800","7215800"," Which doesn't care about your call buying."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7215800","7218800"," We've also gone down you can see right here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7218800","7230800"," We were at earlier at that 601 I think we're now down a 576 which is good to see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7231800","7234800"," Right there 577."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7234800","7238800"," So we're slowly making our way down over here now down a 576."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7238800","7242800"," I think we're at 660 just a bit ago."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7242800","7249800"," Now down a 44% bullish which is not bullish."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7260800","7264800"," The hero indicator is fucking buyers."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7264800","7266800"," Lots of buyers."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7266800","7272800"," But it's kind of odd too because we were talking earlier about the crazy put buyers today, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7272800","7275800"," Before we started to roll over."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7275800","7285800"," We were talking about the Biden speech and why are so many people buying fucking puts right now on that 440P."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7285800","7288800"," Which is completely against the hero indicator."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7288800","7294800"," I was wondering about this earlier on one of the streams that we were running earlier."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7294800","7296800"," Why do we have all this?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7296800","7298800"," The hero indicator is positive."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7298800","7299800"," We've got a nice beautiful bullfly."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7299800","7300800"," We've all these things same."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7300800","7302800"," We're going to fucking go up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7302800","7308800"," And yet you've got an entity that just keeps buying fucking puts at 440P."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7308800","7309800"," Right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7309800","7310800"," So that's the question."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7310800","7316800"," Why is everything or why do we have something as sad as we should go up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7316800","7321800"," We would catch a normal person holding the fucking pretty big bag here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7321800","7324800"," Holding this fucking bag here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7324800","7327800"," I'm sure caught some traders without a doubt."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7327800","7331800"," Without a doubt, this caught some traders fucked."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7331800","7338800"," As a matter of fact, if you brought fucking calls in here thinking it was going up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7338800","7341800"," Or you know, up or whatever."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7341800","7344800"," I can promise you right now we ain't fucking going up here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7344800","7348800"," Even if we trade up here, there ain't no fucking way we're going above it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7348800","7350800"," It doesn't be a hard-ass rejection."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7350800","7353800"," Your calls are fucked if you bought calls here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7353800","7355800"," These are actually a good rip."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7355800","7357800"," I took a quick call trade here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7357800","7359800"," And then a quick put trade over here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7359800","7367800"," It's like a five-minute trade and a five-minute trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7367800","7369800"," Missing paid pretty well."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7369800","7374800"," Let's see if we can get some reversal off this here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7374800","7378800"," Trap in those call buyers."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7384800","7388800"," We'll look also for that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7388800","7391800"," See that right down here?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7391800","7395800"," Not only close the gap at the bell, the official close."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7395800","7397800"," As a matter of fact too, if you look right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7397800","7401800"," The official close here of cash market before the after hours."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7401800","7402800"," We had it down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7402800","7404800"," We touched down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7404800","7411800"," And this looks like another place to for reversal."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7411800","7413800"," Right where you are actually."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7413800","7415800"," My reverse right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7415800","7423800"," Let's see it right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7423800","7452800"," It's a beautiful thing right there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7452800","7457800"," Nice trade right there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7457800","7458800"," It's currently 256."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7458800","7463800"," We know we've got Biden speaking at 345."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7463800","7466800"," So this has to happen sooner than later."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7466800","7473800"," We don't want the Biden pump coming out at 345 and be caught short."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7473800","7479800"," So this should hopefully get this to roll right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7479800","7493800"," And not have to wait."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7493800","7504800"," This is rolling over a little bit as well."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7504800","7514800"," No test of no test of 24."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7514800","7533800"," 99 or whatever 25, 25, whatever it was."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7533800","7542800"," Patience."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7542800","7547800"," Be careful when my boy here comes on trade the news."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7547800","7554800"," He likes to say shit like we have a buy side imbalance that he comes back on and says,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7554800","7557800"," oh, we have a sell side imbalance too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7557800","7566800"," Like in a half an hour, you'll say something like that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7566800","7568800"," Yeah, you guys can hear me right."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7568800","7571800"," That's what I turned off right there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7571800","7574800"," We got two mics on this live stream right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7574800","7578800"," I have no fucking idea why."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7578800","7597800"," This live stream is a hot fucking mess."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7597800","7598800"," All right."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7598800","7603800"," Let's see what you guys are saying in chat."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7603800","7606800"," We got those guys in the money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7606800","7607800"," Great."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7607800","7609800"," Have not been updated on the website yet."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7609800","7613800"," Yeah, Willie, those I bonds are banging, bro."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7613800","7614800"," I didn't see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7614800","7616800"," Look, see, I thought you could do it twice here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7616800","7618800"," That was like 10,000 twice."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7618800","7622800"," I didn't know it was only once that you could only buy those I bonds once."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7622800","7623800"," I saw that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7623800","7625800"," I saw a guy talking about it a few days ago."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7633800","7646800"," Yeah, they're one dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7646800","7648800"," I thought I'd fucking call zero."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7648800","7650800"," I would call the next expiring as a zero day."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7650800","7652800"," I don't give a fuck with zero dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7652800","7653800"," One dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7653800","7654800"," Two dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7654800","7655800"," One out of boy."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7655800","7656800"," Don't worry."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7656800","7657800"," I think they sell the puts."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7657800","7658800"," This is a chapter bull."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7658800","7661800"," You have the bull pattern."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7661800","7662800"," Wait for three p.m."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7662800","7664800"," Almost our power."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7664800","7670800"," Yeah, we're at now at the power hour of three p.m."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7670800","7671800"," We'll get our man."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7671800","7674800"," Come on here and tell us what's going on."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7674800","7676800"," Or anybody know where do we get the information?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7676800","7679800"," Do you think I'll trade what they bought sold?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7679800","7683800"," Yeah, I get the information from spot gamma."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7683800","7686800"," They usually post the write up about it as it's coming in."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7686800","7689800"," A day that it comes in."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7689800","7693800"," Usually what they're doing is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7693800","7697800"," I was biding on right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7697800","7704800"," Yeah, so like what they'll do is the day that they placed it was here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7704800","7706800"," The day that they fucking placed it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7706800","7709800"," They literally they fucking literally placed it fucking right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7709800","7711800"," Right on the 29th."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7711800","7712800"," They place the fucking trade here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7712800","7716800"," What they do is they sell calls here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7717800","7720800"," And the fucking all the fucking retail traders buy them."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7720800","7722800"," And then they can impact the market."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7722800","7726800"," They actually push the market down once they place the put thread."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7726800","7730800"," So then they they buy and sell puts, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7730800","7735800"," The crazy part is that I believe they're dated for March 18."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7735800","7743800"," Or excuse me, May 18th."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7743800","7744800"," Don't quote me."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7744800","7745800"," I was looking at them."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7745800","7752800"," We're inside one hour now to the US cash equity closed stocks remain near the lows of the afternoon down across the board after the up open."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7752800","7755800"," We saw this morning in the wake of the CPI figures."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7755800","7762800"," Crude futures holding on to gains of more than six and a half percent today, 151 less than WTI crude."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7762800","7767800"," And the VIX now down about 1.6%."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7767800","7770800"," And the trade is the trade is market moving."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7770800","7777800"," And the other crazy part is that enough people know about the collar or they fucking follow it, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7777800","7785800"," They fucking follow the put spread all the way to fuck down until it prints."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7785800","7790800"," Now we've gone past the put spread in the path, the collar in the past."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7790800","7795800"," But if we don't see continuation down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7796800","7804800"," Of like of hedging and put buying to bring us lower, which we need to see."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7804800","7807800"," It's the same with calls right in the way up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7807800","7808800"," It's the same thing."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7808800","7811800"," If you're only buying fucking zero dates."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7811800","7815800"," You know, for four forty five or four fifty, you ain't going to four sixty today."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7815800","7819800"," You have to continue to buy the calls outside outside the money."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7820800","7822800"," So these guys get paid, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7822800","7825800"," The bag gets filled and filled as you go up until someone doesn't believe anymore."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7825800","7828800"," The same thing is appropriate here as well."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7828800","7836800"," It works both ways, even in a negative quote unquote negative options environment."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7836800","7839800"," But you can see these trades every quarter."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7839800","7843800"," They tell you exactly what they're doing and where the collar is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7843800","7848800"," And what they're doing right now, there's discords where people track."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7848800","7851800"," To see when the big buyer comes in."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7851800","7854800"," And buys fifty million dollars in calls."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7854800","7859800"," So you're going to look for these puts to be these put spreads to be closed, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7859800","7861800"," And then you're looking for what the trade is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7861800","7863800"," And then you'll start to hear whispers, those things."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7863800","7865800"," And then you'll see you'll visit."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7865800","7866800"," There's the cowboy too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7866800","7869800"," That's car like and I think that's car like and."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7869800","7871800"," The cowboy trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7871800","7873800"," He'll provide liquidity down here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7873800","7877800"," And then Ackman will come in and buy fucking calls to go higher."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7877800","7892800"," Watching May twenty one eighty four P on IWM for one point four million dollars."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7892800","7898800"," Talked about GPM earlier today and I said I didn't like that trade, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7899800","7904800"," JPM April fourteenth one thirty P hundred one thousand dollars."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7907800","7909800"," We'll see if we can get this into the into the bell."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7913800","7917800"," Nice little rejection over here now trading down a force to thirty seven seventy six."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7929800","7934800"," So you have people figuring out what the JPM call or trade is."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7934800","7936800"," And then they fucking amplify it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7938800","7940800"," They wind up wanting to follow it, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7940800","7941800"," You're like, Hey, JPM is doing it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7941800","7942800"," I'm going to fucking do it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7942800","7944800"," Simple, simple enough thing to do."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7945800","7949800"," And the crazy part is they pay for the fucking trade by selling the fucking calls."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7950800","7953800"," So the fucking calls are paying for the fucking entire trade."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7958800","7978800"," Four thirty five."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7978800","7985800"," There's four thirty three."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7985800","7992800"," Huge buyers stepping in here too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7992800","7994800"," Just be just be just be careful of this right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7994800","7995800"," Okay."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","7995800","7998800"," This is a large support area here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8008800","8023800"," Okay."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8023800","8030800"," Okay."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8030800","8048280"," $4.40 now $3.20. They're bouncing around like mid $2 per minute."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8060800","8088560"," And now they've printed the calls they've sold."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8088560","8102240"," sold. And they'll end up printing the put spread. Is it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8102240","8108960"," gorgeous fucking trade? Now that the trade doesn't always print"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8108960","8111720"," either. There are times when that trade has not printed for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8111720","8115920"," them. But it fucking gets goddamn close to printing."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8118560","8128640"," It ends up being a free hedge basically. Well, I think that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8128640","8133560"," does that right. So it becomes a free hedge. What's a free"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8133560","8136760"," trade? Yeah, it's a free trade as a hedge."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8148560","8166920"," Now trading down to 437.35. Let's see if we can break that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8166920","8169200"," 435 and get down to that 433."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8196920","8206080"," It's a long way to go. It's 4340 is where it's where it's"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8206080","8211280"," out on ES. Or no SPX. Get that wrong. Should be looking at"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8211280","8227080"," fucking ES. Looking at SPX. We're almost there. We're getting"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8227080","8232480"," real close to SPX. Sorry, I wasn't paying attention to the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8232480","8242680"," screen. Real close to an SPX."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8262480","8289840"," There it is right down there. There it is right fucking there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8289840","8298000"," So fucking close. Get so far away."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8298000","8314000"," Right there. Right down there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8320000","8326080"," Almost there. He knows he wants it. JB Diamonds like give it to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8326080","8329760"," me. Print it. Can you imagine being them right now going"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8329760","8334000"," fucking $50 million trade? Probably like racking up fucking a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8334000","8337360"," million dollars right now every fucking 2010 points or so"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8337360","8341920"," million million million million. Oh, I love it. Fucking love it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8349840","8369560"," No, all I've got is this here. This is my price target. My"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8369560","8375560"," price target right now has been this collar. So I've been"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8375560","8379360"," looking for over the past week, this fucking collar to hit. I"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8379360","8382080"," don't know if we get down here or whatever, not interested."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8382080","8384880"," Only I'm interested in right now is this JPM Colligan fucking"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8384880","8385200"," filled."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8409360","8436160"," Yeah, I see that TLT curling up right now. I like the idea of"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8436160","8441040"," this TLT trade with the Biden speech."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8466160","8489120"," There it is right down there. Big fucking block right here at"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8489120","8493040"," 434. This is where it's actually at. Right with this big block"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8493040","8497840"," is now trading down to 436 88 right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8503040","8509600"," 440 is an hour $3.82 $3.85. I think the first time we talked about"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8509600","8513440"," we talked about them all fucking day long. But the first time"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8513440","8518400"," really highlighted it was like $1.50 I think now at $3.89."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8523040","8542960"," This spreads getting wider on it too like $0.10."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8542960","8546160"," Some profit taken going on right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8553040","8568720"," I just want that plunge to 434. Let's just give the"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8569040","8571520"," 434."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8574480","8577920"," A couple of 435 60."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8578800","8584640"," This is where it's at right down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8584640","8597840"," A little bit of ice down here 435 56."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8600320","8609360"," Real money selling baby."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8614640","8632160"," Yeah, be careful about the Biden speech. It's at 345"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8632160","8636400"," supposedly. I'm going to look it up right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8636400","8641600"," Usually we end up getting a fucking squeeze higher on a Biden speech or at some"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8641600","8649280"," point. We've got 29 minutes left until he supposedly speaks."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8649280","8653760"," He is late sometimes. I used to be scared of him"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8653760","8659360"," giving these speeches towards the close but"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8659360","8664960"," they're all the fucking same. They fucking try to pump the markets up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8672480","8678000"," I think I'm going to have to go to the White House."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8678000","8687520"," Yeah, I'm going to have to go to the White House as actual love."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8697120","8698320"," I'm going to have to go to the White House."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8698320","8710400"," Doug, we've got 27 minutes."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8719600","8723440"," 27 minutes to get to 434."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8724160","8726880"," We're inside 45 minutes now. The view is cash equity close."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8726880","8728800"," The pressure on stock markets continuing here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8728800","8731920"," The Dow down 163. The S&P down 27."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8734240","8738240"," Gold futures catching a bit of a bid up $24 on the day in 1972."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8738240","8740160"," The high was 1982 70."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8742080","8744160"," Someone shouted out gold earlier. Looked bullish."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8744160","8746640"," Fixed it up one and a quarter percent on the day."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8746640","8748960"," The dollar index is up three tenths of a percent."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8749840","8755200"," Remember, some of that gold trade continues to weigh in equities and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8755200","8757920"," other assets. Seeing movements in other asset classes."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8762480","8764880"," Little bounce here on the spy."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8767200","8768880"," Still looks kind of weak down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8769600","8772960"," Looked in the right hand side on a 436. 435.60."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8778960","8796320"," I'm going to take a look at a candlestick chart."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8801440","8803440"," That plunge down here would be fucking perfect."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8804560","8806800"," Just that last little plunge down below here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8807680","8809360"," Still have more where we can go too."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8812560","8815360"," We know you have the one touched here, here, and here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8817520","8818960"," If you're looking on a bigger scale,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8820960","8822800"," I don't know, excuse me, a bigger, larger scale."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8823680","8826800"," We could easily drop down here, grab that collar at 434."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8828400","8829920"," Easily grab that collar."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8830400","8837120"," I've seen that one little push."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8838160","8841760"," I wonder if they pull it up and save it for the overnight."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8860560","8867760"," It looks like we're trying to retest the highs at 25 right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8868320","8871200"," We've got the VIX screaming higher to 24.99."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8874240","8879520"," For whoever has asked them about Baba earlier, Baba, December 16th."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8879520","8880400"," They never trust these."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8880400","8882240"," This could just be China fucking buying shit."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8882240","8884160"," They spend money like this all the time."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8884160","8889120"," But it's December 16th, 105c, $6.8 million."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8890800","8897520"," Some other notable calls, April 14th, Tesla, 990C, $418,000."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8901840","8910000"," Bunch puts on spy, IWM, TQQQs puts on AMD."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8910800","8918400"," DAL with puts, April 14th and April 22nd, 36 and 35p."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8918400","8920480"," Small money, 18 grand, 27 grand."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8921920","8923840"," Some dip buyers stepping in right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8924720","8927360"," Still small money though, in terms of are we going up here?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8932240","8936400"," It does get risky the closer that we get to the Biden speech to be short here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8936400","8944480"," At least historically it is, 436, 88."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8947200","8948080"," So far at the bottom."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8953200","8955520"," It's close enough and fucking hand grenades though."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8955520","8959040"," Fucking tell you what, I've been talking about that shit for weeks now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","8966400","8991440"," Fucking 50 handles to go on SPX it looks like."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9026400","9027200"," Just the heads up."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9027200","9028560"," Don't be buying this dip here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9028560","9029680"," You still, I guess you could."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9029680","9034960"," But if you look here, there's just a ton of cell pressure here at 439."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9034960","9042320"," 50, 438, just feeding into any buyers down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9042320","9065120"," All right, I'm getting some weirdness going on."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9072320","9088000"," Yeah, 109,000 calls bought right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9088640","9093440"," 75,000 puts, another 50,000 calls bought right where we are."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9095360","9097120"," Dip buyers definitely stepping in here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9098640","9100160"," You can see the numbers right here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9100960","9102320"," Here and here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9115680","9117840"," Big call buyers stepping in right now in the spot."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9117840","9121360"," Bye."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9128000","9137920"," Huge call buyers on IWM as well."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9144080","9145920"," These are the parts of live streaming where I'm like,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9145920","9147360"," fucking, I wasn't live streaming right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9147360","9149920"," I'd be fucking digging through and seeing if they close those fucking,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9150480","9152480"," those fucking put spreads right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9154240","9158480"," I'll hear about it later today in fucking, oh, here, there's a couple of discords."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9158480","9161600"," They talk about it in, but until I fucking hear about it,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9163440","9165760"," I'm like, oh, they still open right now or not."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9170480","9171840"," Is that what they're talking about?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9171840","9172800"," Is that what they're talking about?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9172800","9174000"," A federal gas credit?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9176880","9183760"," I got fucked in, I got fucked in, I got fucked on, I was part of Tanker Gang."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9183760","9186640"," The original Tanker Gang, I was in that, I was in Tanker Gang."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9188320","9192320"," I was gonna have to take a fucking delivery on fucking 50 million gallons of fucking oil."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9194480","9197120"," We used to joke that we'd fucking bury it in the backyard."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9197120","9199200"," Wish I, wish I had taken delivery on it."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9199200","9201680"," I would have fucking, I got fucked in that trade, by the way."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9201680","9204960"," But I made a lot of money on the actual tankers themselves."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9206720","9208880"," The guy from fucking Greece."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9211120","9216080"," But like I ended up fucking, I was trade fucking, oil fucking futures."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9227200","9229120"," The, that wouldn't surprise me."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9229120","9233120"," Like a federal gas credit, wouldn't shock me right in your taxes or something stupid like that."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9234000","9236800"," Nothing that, nothing that, nothing that they say would shock me right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9238480","9242640"," Brainer today fucking saying that they're not gonna do QT until June."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","9479360","9482000"," is look up what March or May 18th."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","9485360","9487440"," on the 434."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9489120","9489680"," Put spreads"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9493280","9495120"," from the top and see if they're at 100%."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9497440","9499040"," That's what I should do."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9499040","9500720"," Those things got to be printing right now."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9501280","9502240"," Heavy and hard."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9519920","9522960"," We'll then have bounced here at the 437 flat."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9523840","9529200"," 436, 667 right down here."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9529200","9530640"," They snuck it right down there."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9547840","9551040"," This fucking puts their leg up down 30%, 40%."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9551840","9553360"," Let me not 30%."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9553360","9554960"," They're down like 15%, 10%."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9565840","9567680"," Got Biden speaking in 14 minutes."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9568560","9569040"," Yes."
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9579440","9580800"," Also just saw coming,"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9580800","9586000"," Apple calls June 16th, 220C for $3 million."

"XkQlGwYdWCw","9595840","9597840"," And Apple"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9616040","9622800"," This morning that he's back on YouTube which is kind of fucking rad I don't even want to fucking stream when he's on"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9622800","9624800"," I want to fucking watch his stream"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9625840","9633380"," If I could love that guy I used to watch him all the time and then when I started fucking making videos"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9633380","9636360"," I stopped watching him because he fucking influenced my videos"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9636360","9641640"," And I'm like if I can't influence how I was thinking and I'm like I can't fucking I'm not gonna go regurgitate Brian"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9641640","9643640"," Watch shit on the internet"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9644560","9647680"," I'm like we fucking fucking put us"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9647680","9652280"," But that's why I don't watch fucking YouTube videos anymore because that shit because the fucking shit gets in my head"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9652280","9658920"," And then I'm like then I'm like that parry but start thinking how other people are thinking"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9662280","9666640"," If he puts a schedule on I just won't fucking stream that day and just fucking follow his ass"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9668320","9670320"," Guys the fucking man"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9677920","9680480"," Now trade down to 436 67"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9682520","9684520"," You"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9688000","9690000"," It's getting close"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9691640","9693640"," It's getting close we're almost there"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9697120","9699120"," Right down in here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9700480","9702480"," We're almost there"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9704640","9707960"," Almost there watching lots of call buying right now, too"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9708640","9715160"," Calls on Disney April 29th 130 C for $375,000 calls on Nike"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9716800","9722520"," April 29th love all kinds of a ER plays April 29th 125 C"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9724480","9726480"," It's a rather notable ones"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9726840","9728160"," X"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9728160","9732200"," 9 September 16th 40 C for $200,000"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9738960","9740960"," What else do I see here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9749320","9757680"," Anything else interesting this is interesting one a firm June 17th 30 p 691 thousand dollars"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9767960","9773360"," Also to note we talked earlier about Facebook"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9773360","9779760"," We said don't buy that Facebook fucking eight million dollar trade to look for a bounce off 210 or 200"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9779880","9783480"," Well to look for the bounce and also look to see if those calls are still in play"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9784120","9787840"," So we're getting down here. We just bounced off 213 13"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9788400","9793480"," So just set set alert down to 10 or so 210 you know 210 50 or something and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9794200","9802280"," Check it again and see if they're still in those those eight million dollar calls or at the 200 level"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9807760","9812520"," Just some alerts down here 210 then we've got 200 down here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9814280","9819560"," We know that the bank spot it this is a bank buy-in down here and they're willing to defend this right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9820240","9827240"," So if there's any kind of a bounce down here the grab for the repire should see something like that between 210 and 200"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9828040","9832120"," But you want to if you if you see this this move down over here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9832560","9834560"," Just keep track of that trade"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9835080","9838240"," Make sure that they're still long on those calls down here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9838240","9844000"," They don't give a fuck about this this move down for OPEC's this month because they're not going to care about this"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9844000","9847520"," Hadn't it into what I think it was a June right on those Facebook calls"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9850400","9854040"," Or if they roll them into a new position"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9856000","9860600"," Let's say you see the eight million dollar calls are gone. You might see them rolled a month later"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9861480","9863480"," So just peel through the options"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9865840","9870320"," Chain they have right now for May 20th 220 see"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9872000","9875240"," Just keep track of them that could be this could be a good trade"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9876240","9881920"," It's a good trade right now, but I think it could be if they stay in the trade or roll into it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9881920","9887000"," They just say fuck you spend another ten million dollars and the ten million dollars and they're committed"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9887480","9892280"," It's it's usually eventually fucking they printed they eventually force it to print"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9894840","9898040"," Keep your eye on that trade unless that's Kathy fucking woods"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9898480","9901880"," Just gonna come out and announce that she bought the dip on fucking Facebook again"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9906240","9910760"," All right, we got three thirty seven. We've got seven minutes until the Biden speech is"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9911960","9913960"," tentatively going to start and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9915960","9920520"," I'm not seeing anything here. There's no like lectured and people shuffling"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9921200","9924560"," Says we'll begin shortly. So it looks like he is running late again"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9925200","9931080"," That could be wrong on that of course. He could pop up right at three forty five, but he's known to be late"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9931680","9933680"," like other presidents"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9936240","9941440"," I'm gonna expect some I'm gonna expect this to be some covering down here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9942640","9944640"," This is the time to cover I think"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9951600","9953560"," We're getting too close to three forty five"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9956040","9958680"," So we got to have a four thirty six sixty seven"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9958680","9965080"," Do I think that you buy calls here? Yeah, probably not"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9965080","9969040"," I'd like to see into opex we sell off an opex on a Friday"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9969480","9971680"," Then we could even if we get up to 450 again"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9971680","9977520"," Or if you get up to 450 that trade hired tomorrow for a second short down into Friday"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9977800","9980160"," Just take the short at 450 if we get that high"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9980360","9985720"," Don't buy that this is not the place to buy the dip like him buying the market air even if you see"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9986280","9988280"," market buyers coming in right here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9988680","9992160"," Watching more silver calls come in. They usually follows the gold trade"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9992160","9996240"," You'll see the gold trade print first and the silver trade follows along"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","9997760","10003680"," So we got some squeezing happening here on the spy into the into into Biden"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10003680","10007040"," You could play this you could trade this for a five-minute trade or something"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10007880","10013560"," Currently as we head into the bell, but I wouldn't be holding it. Let's talk about that real quick. Okay"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10014440","10016440"," I'm gonna show you a chart here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10017440","10022800"," I'll see you see what I'm talking about. So the regime right now, right is to sell rips"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10022800","10027720"," We know that already right we sell rips that we're in let me soon bring this over here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10029120","10033980"," So the regime right now, we know we got below 450 right once we got below is 450"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10034080","10035760"," We're in negative gamma, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10035760","10041000"," We know that we have volatility and we know we talked about a 1.5% move today"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10041000","10045680"," And we know that you switch from buying dips to selling rips, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10046520","10049400"," Now I was wondering if we come down here today and test for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10050080","10056760"," Where's this one down here 440 and trade back up here to 450 because we've seen this happen in prior"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10057760","10062520"," CPI numbers you get the first trip higher because it's not as bad as"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10063080","10067360"," It's expected. We got what we expected right we got that move like we expected here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10067800","10069800"," and then the question becomes"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10070680","10075760"," This was the first short. Where is the second short is that at 450 up here?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10076440","10080440"," I kind of think that we went below 440 here this support"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10081120","10085040"," So where is the second short? I guess is the question and in reality?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10085600","10091240"," It's gonna be somewhere between 440 442 in here. It's moved down. It's somewhere here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10091240","10095560"," We've broken through 440. We know where this zigzag is over here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10095560","10097320"," So it's gonna be somewhere somewhere in here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10097320","10103800"," We kind of stayed in this zigzag close to fucking up in hand grades and horseshoes that I know a bunch of your asses"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10103800","10105800"," Don't make these trades"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10105920","10109240"," You know or close enough to endorse using hand grades, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10109240","10114760"," So it's probably somewhere in this zone here. You're gonna see the second short that the key here though is"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10115760","10119560"," Let's say Biden says something great, right? Let's say we trade up here tomorrow"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10120680","10124400"," Unless we break above 450 we're still in negative gamma"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10124400","10129340"," So it's just another opportunity to go short. So where do you go short here for the next short, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10130120","10132120"," It's most certainly"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10132360","10137120"," My point is you wouldn't hold along in here because at any point if we start to sell down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10138160","10142800"," Tomorrow, right? You're gonna get fucked unless you're trading futures as a hedge"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10143440","10147280"," So if you're want to be a bear or a bull if you're want to be a bull"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10147280","10151600"," Yeah, you can take this trade right now into the bell sell it before 4 p.m"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10152560","10157960"," Take the money and run if you're a bear and looking for the next trade down I"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10158680","10162000"," Would say you could enter your first short at the bell here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10163200","10168040"," You can enter one and then re-enter tomorrow if we trade higher on some good Biden news"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10168480","10174480"," You could you could add into that for Friday expiry and buy them for like Monday or next Friday or something"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10174480","10179560"," So you have some some playroom for this next trip. There is another short. We went below 440"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10179560","10183320"," That's the key is that we now have a new resistance here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10183920","10185680"," Whether you like it or not"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10185720","10190480"," This is a new resistance above us and it's a big one that 440 is now a"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10191440","10193440"," fairly substantial resistance"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10193880","10198360"," Now we now even when you have that resistance you can trade above it. It'll get retested"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10198360","10201040"," We know 440 is gonna get retested here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10201040","10206800"," We know before even if we do roll it over it's gonna get tested on the way down. That's not bull surely"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10206800","10212320"," It's just saying that we always retest and hold me take a look and the new price target now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10212320","10218520"," We've traded below for 40 less something unless some some events some headline event that we don't know about"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10219280","10221280"," Snow for the US trade"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10221480","10226960"," We are monitoring some headlines that have been circulating throughout this afternoon two major international bridges"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10226960","10230800"," I have effectively been shut on the Mexican border as Mexican truckers have blocked"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10230800","10234400"," Yeah, we know that both directions to protest a new border security initiative"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10234680","10237480"," That's been instituted by the Texas governor Abbott"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10237560","10239560"," So"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10239560","10244360"," Now that we're down here right in wider circulation of these earlier press reports now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10246960","10250440"," So now that we are down here, let's we're down here 436"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10250440","10256960"," We didn't quite get the JPM call. It's really what I wanted right get the JPM call in cash market and rip it fucking higher"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10256960","10261120"," Right, we're not getting that currently at this moment. So what does that mean right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10261120","10265280"," We're gonna we're gonna do is we're going to test this 440 now, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10266120","10267880"," This zone"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10267880","10270200"," Then we're gonna we're gonna try to test this here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10270200","10274840"," We're gonna look for rejection right to validate that we're gonna continue to head down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10275240","10281600"," From here right and the next but the next place you're looking for is 430 not the 434 anymore"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10281600","10288360"," You're gonna be looking for 430 right and then then you'll look for a break below that and a rejection to come back down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10288360","10294880"," This seems logical with where we are in the in the breadth indicator to at least come down here and test"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10295400","10298440"," This lower level in this lower level that we're gonna look at right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10300720","10303760"," Is this last time right one two three"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10304640","10307720"," It might be slightly off of an ES"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10308200","10313720"," But for just the sake of hand grenades and horseshoes. It's gonna be somewhere down here at this 420"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10314240","10320400"," Now that we've broken this 440 so we're gonna look for that take down 430 and look for that take down 420"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10320400","10323400"," And we'll look for a liquidation event in this market"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10323400","10329400"," This could accelerate into this is the 15th here. This could accelerate into"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10329920","10335240"," The 18th. This is the I believe oh no, I believe OPEC's is the 15th for this month right here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10335240","10340320"," So we'll look for a believe it or not an accelerate. We're gonna look for it might not happen, but"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10340960","10342040"," We're gonna look for it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10342040","10349360"," We could actually take place into Monday. Sometimes OPEC's doesn't it ends on that fucking Friday, but sometimes that shit carries over into Mondays"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10350680","10352680"," So I'm gonna look for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10353400","10360480"," Some kind of a capitulate to kind of retest the 440 if you see the rejection right you're gonna reenter a short position"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10361000","10368400"," To come down to 430 and hopefully come down to 420 doesn't mean you buy fucking zero date puts for fucking Monday for"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10368400","10369440"," 4 fucking 20"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10369440","10373280"," I don't know what they cost right now, but they're probably pretty fucking cheap. We'll take a look at him right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10374360","10379560"," Look at April and we'll get a we got their April 18 piece said right"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10379960","10384360"," We're gonna spy we're closed for fucking Easter right and we got Monday"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10387120","10388760"," 420"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10388760","10393000"," 420 peas or 46 cents fucking expensive you suck"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10393720","10395720"," Jeez, this should be like penny"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10396160","10398600"," You don't make their one for one. So anyways"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10400800","10408400"," How much do they cost for Friday or for Thursday 18 plus the 18th 13th to two days for fucking 200 points"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10408560","10411640"," Here's if you fucking jerk themselves off for that trade, wouldn't they?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10412360","10414360"," And 420s are only worth"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10415280","10417240"," 16 cents"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10417240","10419240"," They don't worth anything"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10419680","10423240"," They don't think we're gonna get there the market makers like fuck. No, we're not going there"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10423840","10428840"," So we probably have a trade higher and then maybe we continue on on Monday"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10430400","10433400"," Now so we'll see there's there's a lot to talk about here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10434400","10438480"," Like he though the sorry I'm looking at the with the market makers are pricing in"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10439520","10441520"," so"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10445800","10447800"," Well on here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10447800","10449600"," Close this up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10449600","10453000"," I think the market makers like market makers like they want to see this"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10453840","10457560"," They want to see this bullshit before they believe and they want to see this retest"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10458320","10461040"," I want to see a rejection here to explore"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10462040","10469080"," 430 and we could trade higher than that to explore and still have the rejection to get down to 430 and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10470760","10474960"," Then to head down into you know the other question that it brings up is"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10477400","10480960"," Maybe we maybe we're gonna for OPEC's hit that 430"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10482560","10487920"," Sideways it and then eventually get down or meet up with this this retest into May"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10488920","10494360"," This could drag us out. This would kind of suck actually if this happened because you can end up dragging this shit out"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10494360","10497960"," You know what else it kind of fits in with is whenever we ramp up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10498600","10503680"," Whenever we ramp up ER season the indexes tend to fucking trade sideways"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10504880","10511600"," So this couldn't have dragged it out into mid-May believe it or not, which would really fucking suck for the indexes"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10513120","10515120"," Not really suck, but kind of suck"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10515960","10517960"," Just keep that in mind"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10519560","10526200"," You probably safe down to 430 if you're gonna take anything after this look for like March May 18 to 420"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10526880","10528880"," for your next target"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10529800","10531800"," If there's a chance for you to grab"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10532680","10537520"," Some puts I would say it'd be your best bets for puts from now into"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10538360","10541400"," May 18 is going to be somewhere up here around 445"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10541400","10547320"," It might be for a brief moment night about be today might be like next week or week after"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10547520","10552720"," You're gonna be selling rips up here at 444 445 somewhere in here 445. Let's call it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10553280","10558520"," This will be your trading trading area here and here. I think heading into"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10559200","10561200"," the panic of May"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10561200","10563200"," I've had to guess"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10564440","10567440"," And in with this trading zone. Yeah, you're gonna be looking for that"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10567880","10570120"," Even if you have this 450 you're gonna be looking for this"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10570120","10575600"," Okay, we're looking for anything up in here to fucking short short short short into mid mid May"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10577760","10579760"," So we'll take them together"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10582920","10585320"," Let me see here clear all this stuff up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10585320","10587320"," So"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10592480","10596560"," Yeah, like take we take fucking profit here even if it squeezes higher just take profit if you're"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10597000","10599000"," Grabbed this long right here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10599320","10605000"," This could go short at any time right every time which we're selling reps any time no matter"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10605000","10611600"," It's here up here or whatever any kind of rip you we're waiting for a fucking rip and you're gonna keep shorting that rip down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10611600","10613600"," Whatever you have the chance"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10615600","10617600"," Still don't have fucking biden on"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10620880","10628220"," Still still have some more stuff coming up for puts coming in Twitter calls April 14 45 c"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10628800","10630800"," hundred fifty fifty three thousand dollars"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10631920","10634960"," What else do I see here some trades coming in for?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10636560","10643160"," MTC H April 29 96 see Baba calls April 13 1 10 c"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10645760","10650320"," So yeah, just keep that in mind if you're if you're bearish on the market in total"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10651040","10653800"," Just keep in mind that let's call it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10656520","10664200"," Keep this keep this uh, you know, whatever we want to call it here in mind for your short just keep in mind to"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10664640","10667080"," Be patient with you getting in your shorts, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10667400","10671360"," We do have a lower high here and a lower high here kind of breaking down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10671560","10678720"," From this which is kind of good just nice to see right you don't want to see a new high so let's call it now at"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10679640","10682920"," You want to be taking shorts at four forty four four forty five"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10683960","10690480"," Anywhere here between there and four forty four. Let's call it short between four forty and four forty five right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10690480","10696960"," If you if you take a short in here of some kind or a long foot and we trade higher"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10697760","10700920"," That's your stop loss or your stop your stops are up here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10701360","10703360"," right above four forty five"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10703680","10710320"," Because if we go from making lower lows to higher highs, that's gonna show that we're bottoming and swooping up higher"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10711000","10713880"," so this is your stops right here four forty five and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10715480","10719400"," Anywhere from four forty to four forty five for your next leg down to four thirty"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10719400","10724520"," I don't know if we get to four twenty and then for maybe we get four hundred or four thousand in"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10724880","10729840"," May 18th. I mean to conservative here, but I don't think don't think times in our side right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10729840","10731840"," I think times in our side"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10733760","10739680"," To get to four thousand like cuz we'd have to drop another 200 points in the next what two days"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10740880","10746080"," Or I would want to see that because I would want to see like because I'm trying to think of it the perspective of"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10746960","10748960"," Let's say we got"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10748960","10750960"," Let's say we got"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10751200","10753200"," Let's say we drop 200 points"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10753200","10757600"," On by Friday. Let's say we get real fucking bearish. We're like fuck that. We're going down here cap"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10758600","10764880"," If you saw that drastic of a drop you're good. Yeah, I guarantee you're gonna see a fucking huge trade higher"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10765360","10768000"," That could happen. I guess that's you can't say it couldn't happen"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10768120","10770120"," You'd see if trade probably the 450"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10770800","10772160"," And then a trade down"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10772160","10775600"," But it's not a lot of fucking runway for this to happen into believe it or not"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10775800","10780360"," There's not a lot of run with world runway for that to happen into a male pegs"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10781080","10783080"," Maybe I guess the possible"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10783560","10788440"," This is probably like a 30% chance that happened and that's still a fucking huge ass move"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10789000","10792600"," That's like bear porn all day long and that's bear pull. That's even bigger bear porn"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10792920","10795480"," Like you test this and break through to four four thousand"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10797400","10799400"," But I think that's still kind of"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10799880","10804680"," Trade it to the right always right stick stick with trading it to the right trade what's in front of you"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10805880","10808120"," The bears have a lot on their side right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10808680","10814500"," What bears are barefuls to understand this? Okay, not only are you breaking this trend down?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10814500","10818600"," You're getting lower highs within within the the wedge here"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10818600","10822240"," Okay, so there's gonna be some capitulation at some point. It looks like right now"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10822760","10826080"," Commitulate some price target right now is gonna be for 30"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10827240","10829240"," My my price started"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10829520","10831520"," jpm 434"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10832720","10834720"," Is still intact?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10834880","10838600"," So maybe it hits 434 and then slides through briefly and comes back up"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10839240","10841240"," And that's it for this month's OPEC"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10841840","10846940"," Look for 430 expect 430 not see a ton of puts down that down there for 20"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10846940","10852040"," I was expecting I was hoping for more puts down below here at like 420 to get us to 430"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10852040","10855980"," But I still haven't seen him come in so without those that doesn't help"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10856840","10862440"," The cause for us getting there either so looking for looking for some some more put flow"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10862440","10864440"," Maybe we'll see it up to the bell tonight"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10864720","10867960"," Sometimes they try to sneak that shit in so that they they"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10869200","10871200"," They can sell futures"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10872560","10877000"," Currently without that without that put buying after the bell today if we don't see that put buying"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10877520","10880840"," We should buy futures. I think here. We'll buy the buying futures"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10882120","10883440"," so"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10883440","10885440"," Unless there's some headline news to send us lower"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10886040","10889240"," So I'll stick around here with you until 4 15"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10889320","10894560"," We even if I get off at 4 o'clock, it's 354 if we close the bell at 4 p.m"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10895360","10897800"," I'll keep track and see if there's any any"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10898200","10903000"," Huge put flow after the bell sometimes they'll sneak it in there so that we actually sell futures"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10904960","10911440"," And I would if you got any longs in here close them just take just take that money and bake it and be done with it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10912680","10916520"," Now even if we we may even sell off in this bell right here right now, but just don't"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10917520","10922000"," Don't go don't fuck around with this if you're a bull. This is all about selling rips and"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10922480","10928120"," We're gonna you only look for a retest of 440 and you're gonna be looking to get short one more time at 440"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10928880","10932240"," 445 cut your losses above 450 of course"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10934480","10936480"," That's all I've got for you. It's 350"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10937560","10942400"," 354 hope you enjoyed the stream. I think that I want to be fucking problems doing these streams"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10943040","10947080"," This my think I had it. I think I was having power disruption"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10948240","10953440"," So I'll try again tomorrow if we can get just one clean stream going. I've got the audio"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10953440","10958200"," I think tinks worked out as well this afternoon. I appreciate your patience hanging out with me"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10958200","10961600"," Please like subscribe these videos. Please tell your friends about it"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10962360","10964360"," You I think you're gonna see some advertising"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10965440","10967440"," In the coming weeks here, too"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10967600","10970880"," It's nothing nothing invasive you might see me have to like"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10971240","10973760"," Spill something in the beginning of the live stream and you might"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10974400","10977680"," You might see an ad the beginning of the live stream"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10977680","10981800"," But that's as far as you would see you wouldn't see me like in the middle of midstream doing anything"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10982320","10985160"," But I'm here so many hours in the course of a day"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10985160","10992080"," And then having to do my own due diligence to make sure that you guys are getting accurate information up to the minute information"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","10992480","10994840"," They have to somehow support the channel"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","11004320","11009640"," You're going to lose interest on those calls into the bell once you hit like 4 4 p.m"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","11009640","11014360"," If we do if we do trade up here, you're gonna see those calls that lose a ton of value"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","11014360","11017760"," I do recommend that you close them for whatever value you got out of those"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","11018280","11019800"," Even if we trade higher here, right?"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","11019800","11025800"," If you think we tramps is 445 or 450 keep the mind set right that you're bearish overall"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","11070920","11073640"," But like fucking at least fucking nine out of ten times"
"XkQlGwYdWCw","11074120","11079000"," You're gonna find out that you're gonna find out that even if we trade higher today, right?"

"XkQlGwYdWCw","11103480","11109160"," One more heave up and another move down like this and you're looking for this here not this trade higher today"
