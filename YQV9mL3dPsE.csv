"YQV9mL3dPsE","0","10320"," Hey, any of you are looking for any last minute gift ideas for me?"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","10320","11320"," I have one."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","11320","16320"," I like Frank Shirley, my boss, right here tonight."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","16320","22120"," Good evening, Captain Jim James here with your daily brief."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","22120","27440"," The second video for this week, I think yesterday I had said to you that I hope to not have"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","27440","30200"," to come back to make one of these videos this week."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","30200","33820"," You never really want to see me coming back to make another video."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","33820","39040"," Now if you did not watch Sunday's video, I'm going to ask you to go back and review"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","39040","42920"," that video or watch that video before you continue into tonight's video."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","42920","49720"," It is important to what we're going to talk about here because last night I talked about"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","49720","54520"," Apple specifically and the individual stocks that were pumping the market."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","54520","60160"," So I talked about how you should have sold Apple and only play it on the runs that it"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","60160","61160"," is going on."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","61160","66400"," We'll look at this in a bit, but that is exactly what took place today."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","66400","70320"," Let's talk about today because it was interesting this morning."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","70320","75080"," As you know, I was posting on Twitter where I was making my entries and exits."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","75080","82480"," I'm also in a Discord that is the kind that you type into."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","82480","89440"," I was also in a voice chat Discord in another room yesterday and it was interesting because"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","89440","93800"," I ended up taking a long yesterday right at the open."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","93800","101800"," I took 11.24 or no, 11.22 or 4.72 or 4.74s, I can't remember."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","101800","108800"," But they were like 36 cents and these printed, we ended up selling these two live on Twitter."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","108800","111360"," They printed for almost 500%."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","111360","116400"," It was a nice run and we sold out of this play up at the top over here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","116400","119320"," This kind of coincides with what I'm going to show you here in a minute."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","119320","121760"," Let's talk about the trading day today."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","121760","127920"," What is interesting is as we started to sell down over here, I tried to make entry twice"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","127920","133520"," in this area and I got stopped out both times yesterday."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","133520","135840"," There was no news in the market yesterday."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","135840","141320"," What's interesting is these trading rooms I was in, everyone else was short down here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","142040","146280"," I was long and I was long on Twitter."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","146280","151280"," The both rooms that I was in, everyone was short and they got destroyed."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","151280","156760"," If there's any bears out there saying that they made bank yesterday, I bet that most"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","156760","157960"," broke even at best."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","157960","162640"," They might have made a little bit but I know that a lot of bears got trapped in this area"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","162640","166680"," at the start yesterday."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","166680","169680"," This is where it gets weird or two."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","169680","173720"," Some bears that I tried to buy, there's a second time yesterday and some bears did"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","173720","174720"," as well."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","174720","178640"," If anyone out there is telling you that this did not look like a trend day yesterday, they're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","178640","180680"," just straight lying to you."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","180680","187120"," That's part of what the title card in this video is about, is that this reversal that"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","187120","193360"," took place with zero news, I searched all over Twitter, I asked in three rooms that I'm part"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","193360","194360"," of."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","194360","199600"," I was only in two yesterday but three rooms I asked and nobody could give me an answer."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","200600","208160"," Nothing was a miss at this point yesterday, you were just waiting for it to cool off a"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","208160","212800"," little bit to pick it up for the next trend run up yesterday."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","212800","217800"," I even had bears yesterday that were switching bull on this trend day."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","217800","222200"," Anyone that's telling you out there that they knew this was the top here at 473, there were"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","222200","226880"," some clues that it was the top but anyone that was telling you that it was yesterday,"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","226880","230520"," I'm going to not believe them."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","230520","233160"," There were some clues."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","233160","240000"," First of all, not the FOMC, I usually don't watch CNBC but in my search for news I did"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","240000","246600"," yesterday turn on CNBC and I realized at that point that there was no news, there was a"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","246600","252160"," hit squad being interviewed on CNBC and that hit squad, what they were doing was selling"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","252160","253960"," the market."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","254960","262440"," With prefacing that, they're not just selling the market but they're rotating into the trades"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","262440","269320"," that we talked about in last night's video earlier than I anticipated."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","269320","273240"," That's okay because even in last night's video I told you that any of your long positions"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","273240","280120"," you should have been sold out of at this point and we're only day trading or short-lived"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","280120","282880"," trades for the rest of the year."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","282880","288200"," You shouldn't have lost anything today other than maybe re-entries later on in the morning"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","288200","290600"," somewhere in this area here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","290600","296560"," The hit squad that came out yesterday, it was important to see that that was a hit squad."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","296560","300760"," They were coming out and telling you that not only had they taken profit off the table"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","300760","306960"," on plays from 2020 but that they were also going to take profit from the plays that they"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","306960","315120"," had drove up in late 2021 which would be like the apples and the Amazon's and at least"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","315120","319640"," you got that information today."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","319640","325840"," As we're in this rotation things can get hairy so I did end up buying this bottom down here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","325840","335480"," today with spreads in the bottom and IWM spy XLE and XLF and I got real concerned as the"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","335480","337680"," day moved on somewhere in here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","337680","345240"," I wound up setting cells on my spreads today and I had some pork, some pulled pork sandwiches"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","345240","346480"," that were made for me."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","346480","351280"," I passed out yesterday, I took a nap into clothes yesterday and they did trigger to"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","351280","354240"," sell at 20%."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","354240","357160"," I wasn't left with anything on the table into this clothes right here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","357160","358960"," I didn't even see this happen."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","358960","363920"," I wound up waking up at like 5, 5, 30 or 7 today and I'm grateful that I got out over"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","363920","364920"," here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","364920","370240"," Now the thing to be concerned about is where we go from here right I guess all of you must"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","370240","373240"," be wondering what the plan is for where we go from here."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","373240","378880"," So we'll get into this a little bit later on in the video okay but I need to show especially"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","378880","383280"," if you're a bull or if you're a bear there's a couple things you need to know okay."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","383280","388720"," First thing is we need to have some confirmations in the next couple days and I'll show you"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","388720","396240"," that in the ES chart and then we're going to look at the VIX as well and there's a reason"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","396240","400040"," we're going to look at the VIX is because I bet there's some bears out there that said"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","400040","404000"," well I carried my shorts into the clothes yesterday."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","404000","408680"," If we're going to reverse the market that was not what you should be doing."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","408680","412880"," You could have carried this into the clothes down here but I would have closed your shorts"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","412880","414160"," right at the bell yesterday."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","414160","418440"," I'm going to go into explain why that is and we're going to look at the VIX real quick"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","418440","425080"," right here and I talk to you guys about following the VIX all the time and the reason"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","425080","428440"," for that is for right here okay."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","428440","436080"," You're going to see the VIX these are this is what I use as a chart to go long okay."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","436080","441280"," When I see the VIX tag these tops over here I start especially like see this one right"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","441280","445880"," here this is in the 22nd this is today you'll see us come up and touch again and it failed"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","445920","453920"," this morning into that into that two o'clock market to 215 or there's that 315 now you'll"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","453920","459360"," see that we shot up again yesterday into the clothes when you see this move like this if"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","459360","463960"," you're a bear you would have wanted to have sold out of your shorts yesterday and this"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","463960","468960"," brings up with a more than likely I'm going to give it like a 90% chance that by open"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","468960","477240"," tomorrow that the market's going to either be green or turn very green at the bell okay"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","477240","480880"," and that's because of where we are here in the VIX now there is a chance we can jump"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","480880","487720"," over this tomorrow at the open but the probability is that we are going to make make some gains"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","487720","491240"," tomorrow at the bell or in the overnight."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","491240","496200"," So you want to be aware of these this chart for when you're going to short and when you're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","496200","498360"," going to go long in the market."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","498360","504120"," There is no such thing as this number going straight up on one push okay or it might go"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","504120","508640"," up in one push if we were to sell the market and have a limit down type situation but we're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","508640","515040"," talking 99 out of 100 times even more than that one you know 999 times out of 1000 it's"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","515040","520840"," never never going to do that move above okay so and even if you lost that one move out"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","520840","526400"," of 1000 you're going to still be able to short it back down so be consider consider of this"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","526400","528000"," if you're going to be bearish."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","528000","535920"," Now for us we're going to be looking for some moves tomorrow in ES in spy to find out if"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","535920","542640"," this market is actually rolling over permanently into the winter and early spring and we'll"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","542640","547760"," talk about that here in a minute but be concerned about this here if you are holding your shorts"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","547760","550840"," or if you're holding puts into the clothes today."
"YQV9mL3dPsE","550840","557960"," Now we're going to first look at Apple this is the chart that I posted on Twitter over"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","557960","563880"," the weekend I think I posted it Friday or Thursday and then I repost it Saturday or Sunday"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","563880","569640"," and I had this little dotted lineup here to show that if we had ripped higher to this"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","569640","576960"," upper resistance to the to then go short okay not only Apple but this would apply to spy"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","577040","583280"," because we know Apple holds spy up this is probably the best indicator today that the"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","583280","589360"," market was going to roll over at I think it was like 10 o'clock or something like that"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","589360","593600"," you should have known at this point that we're going to come back down now the interesting"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","593600","600880"," part about where I made this the interesting part about where I made this is that you can"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","600880","606560"," almost almost certainly guarantee that if you're going to watch a pullback in the market you"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","606560","611760"," want to be watching this Apple chart that I posted on Twitter to see if we get a reaction"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","611760","618880"," or a bounce where this where this extension is over here okay where this fifth move is"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","618880","622880"," and this this Apple chart is really good to see because instead of going straight up here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","623440","629040"," gently into the springtime we did we did take that rocket ship straight up here today okay"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","629680","638640"," now this pullback let's say Apple pulls back to this 154 or 148 or even as deep as 144"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","639600","647600"," it still is not a sell the market type situation so we can't you we have to actually break 145"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","647600","656400"," for the market to be in a market crash scenario or anything more than an intermediate top okay so"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","656400","663520"," use this chart use these levels and when you're planning how how deep the correction goes or"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","663520","669280"," pullback goes or whatever okay so make those so keep your keep your eyes on Apple as we move"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","669280","674400"," forward the next one that we're going to look at is yeah oh you know we'll look at Tesla next"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","674400","680480"," now Tesla was the one stock today that did not you know what we're going to do we're going to go"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","680480","686080"," back and look at Tesla over here because I did a chart I did a specific Tesla chart"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","686400","699760"," I think yeah and I did this the specific Tesla chart over here to talk about it holding now I"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","699760","706880"," did say if Tesla holds above one 11 20 it'll go to 1263 well we did not do that today did we we went"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","706880","713360"," up to 1202 and the market ended up being set so the indicator to have watched today was most"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","713360","718640"," definitely I guess some of you out there could say well it's because we hit 1200 but in reality"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","719520","725680"," I did this measured move over here it should have hit 1263 today and what really did show it better"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","725680","734400"," today was that Apple resistance channel so one positive thing if you're a Tesla holder is that"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","734400","743120"," we did not break below this 11 21 today and that is important to know okay now the the concern"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","743680","748960"," would be where does spy closed well what's the high on spy tomorrow right and what's the low on"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","748960","754320"," spy tomorrow right do we close with a lower low and do we close with a lower high tomorrow"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","754320","760240"," that would confirm that the reversal on the weekly the monthly it would confirm it but outside of"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","760240","765040"," that we're not get you we're not done yet being we're not out of trend yet I'm going to show you"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","765040","771600"," that here in a second on ES that we have not broken trend yet and that the situation is actually"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","771600","777760"," still normal so if you are a bear you're looking for certain conditions to be met and if you're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","777760","783440"," a bull you're looking for certain conditions to be met to turn bearish at this point okay and"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","783440","789760"," we've seen this in the past I would say when we are in these situations like this typically"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","790880","797280"," you can't really pin it until you are confirmed in another day or two and then you need to further"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","797280","804480"," confirm on Friday but the way the news was given yesterday and where valuations are today"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","805120","810880"," I'm going to probably say that we're going to reverse at this point I was really concerned"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","810880","818960"," today with the hatchet team that was on CNBC so without further ado we're going to head on over"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","818960","828240"," to the ES chart over here and we're going to talk the mini this is important okay so we're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","828240","833680"," going to get a little bit closer here this is the same chart that I had on for yesterday no difference"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","835680","841840"," and this is a neat chart so we took we bought this bottom down here we bought this bottom here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","841840","847120"," I didn't end up closing this on Friday and then I picked it up again this morning let's take a"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","847120","856080"," look here I didn't pick in the morning up over here which was right here and so we bought this"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","856080","861360"," close this open and we closed this above here today we actually wrote this up live on Twitter"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","862000","869280"," and I ended up trying to buy this this uh this sell-off down here and I was stopped out twice"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","869280","875440"," in here and then I bought it again here and wrote it up until I was auto sold here now this sell-off"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","875520","880960"," was excellent into the close yesterday right I'm assuming this comes into 1600 down here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","881920","887920"," now there are some things we need to look at here okay and this is what the concern would be so"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","887920","895360"," this is our trend right here right and you see down here we had a hard no we had a hard no here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","895360","901520"," and we pushed up here and we're now down below here in this same area and we have a confluence"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","901600","908800"," of two rejection zones that are coming into play as we had no let's say this is 930 right here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","908800","914080"," I think we talked about this specific area yesterday but I want you to look where my"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","914080","919520"," where my cursor is down here and you'll see that this is an area where we could bounce tomorrow"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","920080","926000"," at the this is 930 right here we get an up bouncing off here tomorrow so what you're looking for"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","926960","931760"," is you're looking for the lower low right so maybe we sell off into the open tomorrow"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","932320","936800"," you'll end up getting your lower low that you're looking for and then you're going to be looking"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","936800","942640"," for your lower high on the daily when you see both of those things take place right or we or"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","942640","947600"," we shoot up to the lower high and then they close down here tomorrow if that were to happen you can"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","947600","953360"," guarantee we're going to end up rolling okay now I talked to you last night about this number down"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","953360","960800"," here I said to you that this 45 45 was off the table as of right now well the way we move today"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","960800","966960"," this is coming back on the table as we move forward so here's what the plan is going to be tomorrow"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","967920","972480"," is I am going to take this long I know you guys are going to think I'm crazy but I'm going to"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","972480","979200"," probably take this long tomorrow to this look for where we should be looking for our supports"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","979200","984000"," and resistances for tomorrow so what I'm going to be looking in here what I'm going to be looking"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","984000","992160"," for in here is areas of rejection areas of support so when we open tomorrow we're either going to"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","992160","996000"," open and sell right off I guess it's possible that you could say that we would sell right off"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","996560","1000320"," at the open tomorrow but I'm really not looking for that I'm going to be looking because of where"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1000320","1006480"," the VIX is I'm really looking for us to come up and get rejected to not pushing that that lower"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1006480","1011840"," high tomorrow so where would those where would that reject where those rejections be we know we"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1011840","1019920"," have one up in here right so we'll put up we'll put a minor resistance here we know that we can"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1019920","1027600"," have one somewhere up in here we know that we had one here hit right one right here we know have"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1027920","1040640"," another one up in here yep so we've got one there and we're going to put let's spread this out a"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1040640","1050560"," little bit here we're probably going to have another one somewhere up in here so if you're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1050560","1056480"," a bully you can see that there's a lot of work that needs to be done tomorrow I mean you're talking"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1056480","1062400"," about us needing to get all time highs or at the minimum to get a new high on the day that's"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1062400","1068160"," way up here I doubt we get up here tomorrow right so there's a two couple things to be looking at"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1068160","1072480"," you're going to be looking at the VIX right which is that it looks like it's at a top right now"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1072480","1077680"," so I'm going to expect a reversal tomorrow and then I'm going to respect a rejection at some"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1077680","1085920"," point tomorrow above here and for continuing to sell off and testing new lows now we now we talked"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1085920","1091680"," about where we want to target right so if we're going to become bear or turn bear"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1095040","1099920"," we're going to be looking for the rejection above here tomorrow right we've got 4718 4711"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1100400","1108960"," 4702 and we're also going to be looking for 4687 and then what are the price targets once we get"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1109440","1117360"," rejected and the first hard rejection is probably going to be here at 4668 tomorrow and then we'll"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1117360","1124320"," push on through down to 4626 and let's go let's scroll out a little bit farther and see what is"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1124320","1130720"," this 4626 and here we are and this is this new channel that I drew in yesterday so if we let's"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1130720","1138000"," say we start looking at this 4626 this is what I was talking about if we are actually in a trend"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1138080","1143920"," reversal or if we are just selling down into the bottom of this new channel that we have"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1143920","1150480"," so you need to be concerned tomorrow let's say we sell off our price targets 4624"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1150480","1157200"," and we actually bounce here and hold this this could be a huge bear trap for us to make a giant"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1157200","1165760"," move up so let's be concerned about that the next stop though would also be this 4546 down below here"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1166400","1172480"," and so what we would be looking for is to look for a rejection tomorrow right and then we're"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1172480","1176320"," going to so we're going to take this long into rejection then we're going to take it short down"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1176880","1183840"," to for a target of 4624 and then we'll wait for another rip higher and then take it lower to the"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1183840","1191760"," 4547 so stay tuned with me tomorrow on Twitter if you're a bull yeah if you're a bull I would start"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1191760","1200640"," to know how to at least get in and out on each on each uh sell the rip situation right so that"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1200640","1206080"," you can grab a bottom and run it up if you are a bull that can turn to bear I'll give you those"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1206080","1212800"," plays as well this week so that we know when to sell each rip as we roll over into the new year"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1212800","1219120"," and to be honest with you any of you out there it doesn't really matter if we go up or go down"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1220080","1225200"," if it's easier for us to go down right through into the end of Christmas we can make just as"

"YQV9mL3dPsE","1231280","1236720"," including this last one from sunday that if we do end up selling off at any point from now into"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1236720","1242400"," january it still isn't a bad thing you should have already been uh de-risked from the market"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1242400","1247440"," you should be in majority cash and you should be playing with the money that you have a prime"
"YQV9mL3dPsE","1247520","1254080"," example would have been uh front our monday's trading day we were able to make almost 500"
