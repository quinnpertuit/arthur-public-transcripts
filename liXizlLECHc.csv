"liXizlLECHc","30000","32000"," You"
"liXizlLECHc","60000","62000"," You"
"liXizlLECHc","90000","112000"," You"
"liXizlLECHc","112000","114000"," Get"
"liXizlLECHc","144000","146000"," You"
"liXizlLECHc","174000","176000"," You"
"liXizlLECHc","204000","209000"," So I'm gonna give you a quick, quick rundown before I start saying good more and all that kind of stuff for you."
"liXizlLECHc","209000","218000"," So the first thing I want you to be looking at this morning is where do we expect to see the rejection this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","218000","222000"," Now, I don't know why that's not showing up."
"liXizlLECHc","222000","229000"," Okay, so this morning, okay, what you're looking for is the five minutes to be coming down right here."
"liXizlLECHc","229000","230000"," Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","230000","235000"," It's just before you continue on, people want to know where we're headed."
"liXizlLECHc","235000","238000"," Now, this five minutes kind of curling up right now."
"liXizlLECHc","238000","246000"," I'd really like to see it can continue down and some kind of a squeeze higher briefly."
"liXizlLECHc","246000","250000"," We can see the squeeze higher, maybe in price come up a little bit here."
"liXizlLECHc","250000","252000"," And then get more rejection."
"liXizlLECHc","252000","256000"," We could get to start, start continuing on the downward path right now."
"liXizlLECHc","256000","260000"," But I'd really like to see it at least come up, maybe come up like 410 or so."
"liXizlLECHc","260000","266000"," And then reject lower again, but it could just keep start or continue to trade down."
"liXizlLECHc","266000","269000"," Regardless of it does or doesn't."
"liXizlLECHc","269000","274000"," The first place you want to be looking for a target down below is 404 7578."
"liXizlLECHc","274000","282000"," And as you know, there's there are usually natural support levels at fives and zeros."
"liXizlLECHc","283000","285000"," So 405 somewhere in there we'll be looking for."
"liXizlLECHc","285000","288000"," We'll see if there's a quick squeeze here."
"liXizlLECHc","288000","293000"," This is a nice cluster, though, right above here."
"liXizlLECHc","293000","299000"," Here's a three trigger cluster. This is usually very bearish for down velocity."
"liXizlLECHc","299000","301000"," So we'll be looking for a rejection here."
"liXizlLECHc","301000","305000"," Sometimes we just start rejecting the right off the one minute."
"liXizlLECHc","305000","311000"," So if you were to look at this in reverse right now, pretend you're a bull right now, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","311000","313000"," See some consolidation here in the one minute."
"liXizlLECHc","313000","316000"," Wait for the five and the hourly to catch up."
"liXizlLECHc","316000","323000"," And you can usually take another another stab at it for another low."
"liXizlLECHc","323000","327000"," The prices you're looking for here currently have got 40923."
"liXizlLECHc","327000","330000"," 41065."
"liXizlLECHc","330000","333000"," And then 411 9890."
"liXizlLECHc","333000","337000"," Now there's something to be said about this right this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","337000","340000"," And that is how support of the market has been."
"liXizlLECHc","340000","343000"," We're going to look lower so I can explain this better to you."
"liXizlLECHc","343000","344000"," All right."
"liXizlLECHc","344000","349000"," To get some velocity to the downside is going to be a challenge."
"liXizlLECHc","349000","353000"," If you look at if you look at the momentum that's coming up from underneath,"
"liXizlLECHc","353000","358000"," we've got 39565 39723."
"liXizlLECHc","358000","361000"," And then 404 96."
"liXizlLECHc","361000","365000"," And also the options market is not priced for us to go."
"liXizlLECHc","365000","369000"," Much lower than 404 405 somewhere somewhere in there."
"liXizlLECHc","369000","374000"," If you remember yesterday and yesterday's program as we were closing up the day before you had the rip into the close."
"liXizlLECHc","374000","383000"," Yesterday had said, huh, interesting. If you look at February 21st, we don't have any pricing into the upside or the downside."
"liXizlLECHc","383000","387000"," And I thought that was kind of odd that there was no pricing higher or lower."
"liXizlLECHc","387000","393000"," So we talked about a strangle on the up and downside picking up calls and puts."
"liXizlLECHc","393000","395000"," Yesterday afternoon."
"liXizlLECHc","395000","400000"," And it was implying that we have more sideways action ahead of us."
"liXizlLECHc","400000","403000"," And the market wasn't priced that way either."
"liXizlLECHc","403000","408000"," It was probably priced down, I believe 404 405 as an implied move today."
"liXizlLECHc","408000","410000"," So there is an outside chance, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","410000","415000"," That the down move is not going to be as severe as you think."
"liXizlLECHc","415000","419000"," Unless we get more put buying into the market in less support of call buying."
"liXizlLECHc","420000","422000"," Zero day call buying. So we'll watch."
"liXizlLECHc","422000","427000"," We'll watch the options chain this morning. We're going to talk about that today, too."
"liXizlLECHc","427000","431000"," We're going to have a big rant today about zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","431000","436000"," And it's reminding me right now of."
"liXizlLECHc","436000","439000"," It's reminding me right now of."
"liXizlLECHc","439000","441000"," GME."
"liXizlLECHc","441000","448000"," I almost made a post about it last night and I said, you know, I'm going to let it be for the night because it started coming out yesterday afternoon."
"liXizlLECHc","448000","452000"," But more more information about start coming out after yesterday afternoon."
"liXizlLECHc","452000","457000"," And it reminds me of GME because if you were a long GME before any squeezes."
"liXizlLECHc","457000","462000"," And watching how it played out over time."
"liXizlLECHc","462000","466000"," It was just fascinating. And I'm seeing that same."
"liXizlLECHc","466000","470000"," Discussion or discussion like it."
"liXizlLECHc","470000","475000"," That reminds me of GME pre first squeeze."
"liXizlLECHc","476000","483000"," And when you're when you when you know what's going on before anyone talked about before spot camera talked about it."
"liXizlLECHc","483000","487000"," We've been we've talked about it on the show for a long time."
"liXizlLECHc","487000","490000"," You guys know that I've been trading zero dates for years, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","490000","492000"," I think some of you guys know that."
"liXizlLECHc","492000","495000"," I think some of you guys know that I watched that option chain."
"liXizlLECHc","495000","498000"," Every single day all day long."
"liXizlLECHc","498000","502000"," And reading some of the shit that people post."
"liXizlLECHc","502000","505000"," I'm like these people have zero idea what they're talking about."
"liXizlLECHc","505000","507000"," Now they sound smart."
"liXizlLECHc","507000","512000"," And I'm sure that before they make a post, they go on the Internet and they try to write a bunch of shit down."
"liXizlLECHc","512000","516000"," We're like, okay, I'm going to smart sound really smart on social media."
"liXizlLECHc","516000","521000"," So we'll just keep it dumbed down here and we'll explain it to you."
"liXizlLECHc","521000","527000"," So you have a better idea than most people on social media."
"liXizlLECHc","528000","538000"," In the narrative that's trying to be pushed on you by famous banks and especially news organizations like market watch."
"liXizlLECHc","538000","542000"," I'm like, you got to be kidding me."
"liXizlLECHc","542000","553000"," It's like that's like reading an article from that's like reading an article from seeking alpha and claiming that as being real."
"liXizlLECHc","553000","555000"," Anyways, we'll go over that this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","555000","558000"," We're going to have a large discussion about zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","558000","560000"," This morning."
"liXizlLECHc","560000","562000"," The rise of zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","562000","568000"," What's real and what's fake about the narrative being passed around about zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","568000","573000"," But just know the option market right now is not priced in for a bloodbath today."
"liXizlLECHc","573000","579000"," So you need to see no call buying coming in and more put buying coming in."
"liXizlLECHc","579000","588000"," On shorter date and then clenching of the options market. And of course, we had the expiration. We didn't see the unclenching yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","588000","593000"," And what else is funny to this morning is that."
"liXizlLECHc","593000","595000"," I have a buddy of mine."
"liXizlLECHc","595000","601000"," A couple of buddies of mine, as a matter of fact, Andrew Conston had talked about."
"liXizlLECHc","601000","609000"," The impact of closing of puts by by icon and how we should have gotten some or not. He had said we should see some."
"liXizlLECHc","609000","612000"," Acceleration to the downside."
"liXizlLECHc","612000","616000"," Once he closes those positions, we didn't see that right."
"liXizlLECHc","616000","620000"," We didn't see that. I know that I know that the excuses out there now that he's long the market."
"liXizlLECHc","620000","624000"," And that's why it didn't happen. But you still should have seen it."
"liXizlLECHc","624000","630000"," We can explain that later on to maybe try to get ball on this morning and see what we can talk to him."
"liXizlLECHc","630000","632000"," About what we should have seen."
"liXizlLECHc","632000","637000"," And when we should have seen that impact the market, which is just after."
"liXizlLECHc","637000","640000"," CPI, and we didn't see that."
"liXizlLECHc","640000","645000"," Compression, and that is inter entered intertwined into."
"liXizlLECHc","645000","651000"," The market this morning. So if you're, if you're looking at."
"liXizlLECHc","651000","656000"," I'll look on some higher time frames for you here, but."
"liXizlLECHc","657000","662000"," The idea being is very similar to."
"liXizlLECHc","662000","666000"," If you mute this real quick for you."
"liXizlLECHc","666000","671000"," The idea being that back here on."
"liXizlLECHc","671000","674000"," The ninth."
"liXizlLECHc","674000","676000"," We should have seen."
"liXizlLECHc","676000","678000"," And there was an expectation."
"liXizlLECHc","678000","683000"," I don't know what I don't know how much do you guys know about about the smart people out there right."
"liXizlLECHc","684000","688000"," And the people with experience and all that kind of stuff and people that are rocket scientists."
"liXizlLECHc","688000","690000"," They expected."
"liXizlLECHc","690000","694000"," The unclenching down here with the closing of books."
"liXizlLECHc","694000","696000"," It's in comments from a line."
"liXizlLECHc","696000","701000"," So that is a CB chief economist lane who gives the lecture at the National Institute of this right here for you."
"liXizlLECHc","701000","705000"," They were expecting an unclenching when we started to make lower lows down here right."
"liXizlLECHc","705000","708000"," That did not happen."
"liXizlLECHc","708000","714000"," Now there's some very intelligent people that that tried to try to front run this information."
"liXizlLECHc","714000","719000"," Which I highly respect, but then afterwards when it didn't happen."
"liXizlLECHc","719000","722000"," And all their plans were destroyed."
"liXizlLECHc","722000","725000"," There's an expectation that yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","725000","727000"," That would happen."
"liXizlLECHc","727000","730000"," And of course they were all wrong once again."
"liXizlLECHc","730000","732000"," And they got fucked."
"liXizlLECHc","733000","734000"," We tried to short this yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","734000","736000"," Remember we tried to short this down yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","736000","738000"," We checked again later in the daytime."
"liXizlLECHc","738000","740000"," And we couldn't get the roll over."
"liXizlLECHc","740000","743000"," And so the next question would be, does it happen today."
"liXizlLECHc","743000","748000"," And so you see, you see people that claim to be smart saying."
"liXizlLECHc","748000","751000"," Oh, it's that it's the goddamn zero date market."
"liXizlLECHc","751000","753000"," And it's always their problem."
"liXizlLECHc","753000","755000"," It's it's their fault there."
"liXizlLECHc","755000","757000"," And it's interesting because a couple of years ago."
"liXizlLECHc","758000","760000"," I believe his name is Roy Neederhopper."
"liXizlLECHc","760000","764000"," No, not this Neederhopper, but another Neederhopper spoke about."
"liXizlLECHc","764000","768000"," Being able to sell volatility."
"liXizlLECHc","768000","774000"," And had your position, how impactful will be coming the market in a couple of years."
"liXizlLECHc","774000","777000"," So try to find his tweet on fin to it."
"liXizlLECHc","777000","779000"," He posted it, I think in 2018."
"liXizlLECHc","779000","781000"," It was like long, long time ago."
"liXizlLECHc","781000","783000"," And how there will be a rise of that."
"liXizlLECHc","784000","785000"," Incoming years."
"liXizlLECHc","785000","788000"," And so we'll talk about that this morning as well."
"liXizlLECHc","788000","791000"," We're all, we're all all this stuff together."
"liXizlLECHc","791000","795000"," Into today's broadcast so that when you guys hear people talking."
"liXizlLECHc","795000","798000"," Talking like they know what they're talking about about the zero date market."
"liXizlLECHc","798000","802000"," You'll actually know you can just dismiss these people."
"liXizlLECHc","802000","805000"," With a full stop. Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","805000","808000"," Maybe if we get a chance to look into the options, Jane."
"liXizlLECHc","809000","810000"," As well."
"liXizlLECHc","810000","811000"," So you can see who's actually doing this."
"liXizlLECHc","811000","816000"," Like Marco yesterday talking about how there's so much risk to the market."
"liXizlLECHc","816000","820000"," And then we've got, I'm not going to name names, but a new, another volume again."
"liXizlLECHc","820000","822000"," Crazy town shit."
"liXizlLECHc","822000","825000"," We'll talk about all that stuff this morning too."
"liXizlLECHc","825000","828000"," We'll talk about weaponized gamma, all other nonsense."
"liXizlLECHc","828000","830000"," Well, it's not nonsense, but."
"liXizlLECHc","830000","832000"," It is kind of funny to see."
"liXizlLECHc","832000","835000"," You know, I was thinking about this yesterday and I'm like."
"liXizlLECHc","836000","837000"," I'm like, huh?"
"liXizlLECHc","837000","842000"," I'm like, no one had a problem with no one had a problem."
"liXizlLECHc","842000","843000"," Nobody."
"liXizlLECHc","844000","848000"," Had a problem with, uh, no one had a problem at all."
"liXizlLECHc","849000","854000"," With weaponizing zero dates to sell the market in 2022. No one had a problem."
"liXizlLECHc","854000","855000"," That was going on every day."
"liXizlLECHc","856000","862000"," Every day you'd see waves of zero date puts coming in while we were selling the market."
"liXizlLECHc","862000","864000"," And then you see waves."
"liXizlLECHc","865000","867000"," Zero day calls coming in to support the market."
"liXizlLECHc","868000","872000"," So I remember this is like what two weeks ago or past three months, we keep hearing."
"liXizlLECHc","872000","875000"," We're getting another leg down. It's going to be 20%."
"liXizlLECHc","875000","877000"," And now it's going to be 30%."
"liXizlLECHc","878000","883000"," And, uh, then that, and then every reason why we're going to sell, we didn't."
"liXizlLECHc","884000","887000"," And now you've got Marco coming out that goes like yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","887000","889000"," The funny part was that yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","889000","894000"," On Vixpiration, you literally had the entire market go."
"liXizlLECHc","894000","896000"," This is our bread and butter."
"liXizlLECHc","896000","901000"," Vixpiration, we sell the fuck out of this market. It starts on Vixpiration."
"liXizlLECHc","901000","905000"," And they were like, we're going to sell the shit out of this market today."
"liXizlLECHc","905000","910000"," So you know that the smart people right up into JPM."
"liXizlLECHc","911000","913000"," We're short this yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","913000","918000"," And when it didn't happen, they were probably too large to, to, to get out of this market."
"liXizlLECHc","918000","922000"," And so what do you do? You get a guy like Marco is like, we're going to go to the news."
"liXizlLECHc","922000","925000"," And post an article by 10 or 11 or two PM."
"liXizlLECHc","925000","929000"," And say it's the, it's the goddamn zero day call buyers."
"liXizlLECHc","930000","934000"," And in fact, the zero day call buyers are the institutions."
"liXizlLECHc","935000","939000"," These aren't small players and they're the same people that have been doing it for years."
"liXizlLECHc","940000","943000"," Now they've increased their position size over time."
"liXizlLECHc","943000","949000"," It used to be like 140,000 contracts, but then it grew to like 220,000 contracts."
"liXizlLECHc","949000","952000"," And now it's going to like 320,000 contracts a day."
"liXizlLECHc","952000","955000"," Now, if you watch the chain every single day, you'd know that."
"liXizlLECHc","955000","959000"," You know that it's not retail traders. You know it's not hedge funds."
"liXizlLECHc","959000","970000"," These are, this is some serious weight being thrown around serious, serious weight being thrown around by the very institutions that probably fucked each other yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","971000","973000"," And like one institution is fucking another."
"liXizlLECHc","973000","979000"," And then now there's claims that there's soft bank people doing this in the background, but it's not. It's just banks."
"liXizlLECHc","979000","982000"," It's banks doing it and they're doing it to each other."
"liXizlLECHc","982000","985000"," And they did it to each other the way down. There's those ironic."
"liXizlLECHc","985000","989000"," That was ironic that there's a claim that it could produce another volume again."
"liXizlLECHc","989000","991000"," And I'm like, bomb again."
"liXizlLECHc","991000","997000"," Like that was like an 11% drop. As a matter of fact, it was a normal seven, seven to 10% drop."
"liXizlLECHc","998000","1008000"," And then it extended for one last leg down. We see that all the time, even in bull markets, we see one or two months out of the year where you get one more extension down."
"liXizlLECHc","1008000","1017000"," I mean, it was, it was a disaster for the VIX products, but for the, for the regular market, I'm like, okay, so, so 11%. Are we getting 11% now? That's a normal down."
"liXizlLECHc","1017000","1022000"," That's a normal down down part of the month for us eight, six, eight, five."
"liXizlLECHc","1022000","1026000"," I mean, when we were in 2022, we were dropping 20 fucking percent."
"liXizlLECHc","1026000","1032000"," So I'm like, well, wait a minute. Okay. So we're at risk of a crash. Right? This is what market crashes are made of. These are the people."
"liXizlLECHc","1032000","1038000"," These are the people that are saying we're at risk of a market crash. This is what market crashes are made of. I'm like, bullshit."
"liXizlLECHc","1038000","1041000"," We just had a market crash in 2022."
"liXizlLECHc","1041000","1047000"," Are you saying that we were getting another, because this excuse is given constantly, we're going to get a market crash."
"liXizlLECHc","1047000","1051000"," We're like, we already had one. We're already expecting another one in 2023 at last leg."
"liXizlLECHc","1051000","1055000"," Are you saying it's going to be one on top of another? Not happening."
"liXizlLECHc","1055000","1062000"," I know the mechanics in the background. I understand that the logic behind it keeps, it keeps growing."
"liXizlLECHc","1062000","1066000"," Come on, man. It's like, it's just never ending."
"liXizlLECHc","1066000","1068000"," It's someone that's positioned wrong."
"liXizlLECHc","1068000","1072000"," Make or someone is sent or it's not it's people that are positioned wrong. That's what it is."
"liXizlLECHc","1072000","1076000"," I'll just tell you a plane plane is day. That's what it is."
"liXizlLECHc","1076000","1078000"," Which is so funny."
"liXizlLECHc","1078000","1081000"," It's like you got to be kidding me."
"liXizlLECHc","1081000","1086000"," I mean, there's a backstory on Volmageddon as well that's rarely talked about."
"liXizlLECHc","1086000","1089000"," There's some people that know about that story in the background."
"liXizlLECHc","1089000","1096000"," People got fucked in that situation to the actual pros that did sometimes talk about it."
"liXizlLECHc","1096000","1100000"," So, I don't know, it's a disaster or that's not a disaster."
"liXizlLECHc","1100000","1103000"," The comparison's wrong and then the reasoning is wrong."
"liXizlLECHc","1103000","1108000"," It's almost like the people that are saying, well, we're setting ourselves up for another Volmageddon."
"liXizlLECHc","1108000","1111000"," I'm like, these same people are saying, we're getting on the leg down."
"liXizlLECHc","1111000","1119000"," So, now this is the reason. It's nonsense. It's pure nonsense."
"liXizlLECHc","1119000","1123000"," We'll talk about this more this morning later or this afternoon or this morning or something like that."
"liXizlLECHc","1123000","1126000"," We'll get into some data and some details."
"liXizlLECHc","1126000","1131000"," Okay, and with that said, the market has been more supportive."
"liXizlLECHc","1131000","1135000"," We're not seeing the continuation on the downside."
"liXizlLECHc","1135000","1139000"," And part of the reason is we've got this momentum."
"liXizlLECHc","1139000","1143000"," It's been coming up for some time now."
"liXizlLECHc","1143000","1146000"," We're going to look."
"liXizlLECHc","1146000","1150000"," This is odd. This isn't showing here. It's not transferring from device."
"liXizlLECHc","1150000","1152000"," For instance to instance."
"liXizlLECHc","1152000","1159000"," Now, we're going to look over time here and find out why people are all upset."
"liXizlLECHc","1159000","1163000"," They don't want to discuss."
"liXizlLECHc","1163000","1168000"," I don't want to talk about it at all."
"liXizlLECHc","1168000","1174000"," Now, there's some other things that could show you down here, but I'm not going to show you this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","1174000","1180000"," The idea that you need to understand is that over time as time passes, the Fed has bought time for the market."
"liXizlLECHc","1180000","1186000"," If they understand that, okay, we started selling down in January, 2022."
"liXizlLECHc","1187000","1194000"," Now, I don't know if we're getting a soft soft landing or not, but what the Fed did do that no one likes to discuss is bought time."
"liXizlLECHc","1194000","1198000"," And the more time that's bought, this is on the upside and the downside."
"liXizlLECHc","1198000","1202000"," So if we're crank, see this blue line right here for crank and straight up like this, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","1202000","1208000"," We're stretching the market. We're bound to come back down to it, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","1208000","1211000"," In the shorter amount of time it takes to get there, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","1211000","1214000"," The faster the reaction is going to be."
"liXizlLECHc","1214000","1218000"," Now, the same thing happened with our market."
"liXizlLECHc","1218000","1227000"," 2022, we traded down, and then now we started trading sideways, and it's given time for these trends to catch up."
"liXizlLECHc","1227000","1231000"," Now, we can break through them, and there's actually trends lower than this, too."
"liXizlLECHc","1231000","1240000"," But we can break through them, but the fact is that when these trends finally catch up after a year, year and a half or so,"
"liXizlLECHc","1241000","1246000"," it's harder for the market to crash at this point. Right now, it is."
"liXizlLECHc","1246000","1250000"," Now, we can crash through here and go much lower, but it's not as easy."
"liXizlLECHc","1250000","1255000"," And so that's why you're not seeing the acceleration to the downside."
"liXizlLECHc","1255000","1262000"," We weren't able to trade under these things and hold either on previous, previous instances."
"liXizlLECHc","1262000","1267000"," So everyone's like, zero date, zero date, zero dates, and it's not, it's not fucking zero date. Sorry."
"liXizlLECHc","1267000","1269000"," It's not zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","1269000","1281000"," This is a matter of fact, if you look closer, if you look closer, you can see it was not easy to trade under this trend, either way back here."
"liXizlLECHc","1281000","1286000"," It wasn't easy way back here. It wasn't easy way back here. It wasn't easy way back here."
"liXizlLECHc","1286000","1288000"," It wasn't easy way back here. It wasn't easy."
"liXizlLECHc","1288000","1292000"," And you got people trying to tell you that like CPI is going to send us under here."
"liXizlLECHc","1292000","1296000"," Tell me a CPI report is going to send us down under here."
"liXizlLECHc","1297000","1305000"," A jobs report is going to send us underneath there or your zero date bullshit. They were using zero dates right here."
"liXizlLECHc","1305000","1309000"," They're using zero dates that that would be a double compound effect, wouldn't it?"
"liXizlLECHc","1309000","1316000"," If you're using zero dates and it could crash the market bomb again style, it should have while we were selling the market, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","1316000","1318000"," It should have been an amplified effect."
"liXizlLECHc","1318000","1323000"," We should have we should have just started blasting through levels sometime back in in 2022."
"liXizlLECHc","1323000","1326000"," So I just don't want to hear it. I'm tired of hearing it right now."
"liXizlLECHc","1326000","1336000"," Like between the news, when it's being used to try to get the market to go down or to create fear in the market amongst retail and then retailers gobbling it up and just regurgitating it."
"liXizlLECHc","1336000","1340000"," I'm like over it right now. Totally over it."
"liXizlLECHc","1340000","1344000"," And so just right now, you can even see on an hourly right here."
"liXizlLECHc","1344000","1348000"," We're we have a magnet, the magnets up here."
"liXizlLECHc","1348000","1351000"," Magnets not down here. Magnets up here."
"liXizlLECHc","1352000","1359000"," We keep trying to grab gravitate back up onto that long time momentum coming up."
"liXizlLECHc","1359000","1364000"," We traded under it in December. And what do we do? We magnet back up and started trading higher."
"liXizlLECHc","1364000","1370000"," And you might see that same thing happen here, even if we have some weakness in the market."
"liXizlLECHc","1370000","1376000"," Okay. So when you're looking at the downside move, what we expect, are we going to have told you guys a million times?"
"liXizlLECHc","1376000","1378000"," Can we get some acceleration to the downside?"
"liXizlLECHc","1378000","1386000"," If you're a bear, you want to see acceleration. If you're you're a bear, you want to see not only a break of three ninety six told you the magic number."
"liXizlLECHc","1386000","1390000"," Well, I think it would last week was in three ninety six, but you need to break underneath."
"liXizlLECHc","1390000","1396000"," This momentum like get underneath it with velocity and you need to reject it."
"liXizlLECHc","1396000","1401000"," And then get a lot of velocity move in the downside until you do that."
"liXizlLECHc","1402000","1407000"," You know, you need some major news for that to happen and no, it's not going to be just people not buying calls."
"liXizlLECHc","1407000","1412000"," Zero day calls and one day apologize to you. That's not that's not what's going to happen."
"liXizlLECHc","1412000","1415000"," We've seen it already."
"liXizlLECHc","1415000","1423000"," If you're going to blame the zero date market for it, if people stop buying calls, we saw that fucking happen in twenty twenty two."
"liXizlLECHc","1423000","1428000"," And we didn't see it. We didn't see a major crash. We saw twenty percent declines."
"liXizlLECHc","1429000","1432000"," That's like it's always looking for an excuse for why we're going to crash."
"liXizlLECHc","1432000","1438000"," If we drop twenty percent today, would you blame it on zero dates? That's insane out of me."
"liXizlLECHc","1438000","1440000"," That have to be like a fifty percent drop."
"liXizlLECHc","1440000","1445000"," I guess maybe that's what we're calling for now, right? That was my point on price."
"liXizlLECHc","1445000","1449000"," Is it thirty percent from here? Twenty percent from here? Is it thirty percent up here?"
"liXizlLECHc","1449000","1452000"," Is it now fifty percent because of zero dates?"
"liXizlLECHc","1452000","1456000"," It's like just grasping its straws to no end."
"liXizlLECHc","1456000","1459000"," Non-stop garbage coming out of mouths."
"liXizlLECHc","1459000","1465000"," So with that said, we'll get we'll come back to some of this stuff."
"liXizlLECHc","1465000","1468000"," Non-stop just never ends. Just constant constant constant constant."
"liXizlLECHc","1468000","1470000"," Constant bullshit."
"liXizlLECHc","1470000","1472000"," GME was the same way."
"liXizlLECHc","1472000","1479000"," When I was watching, when I was in GME pride prior to the squeezes, I was watching Finn to it."
"liXizlLECHc","1479000","1485000"," I was on there with a guy named suspected saboteur. Look him up. I'm friends with him on Finn to it."
"liXizlLECHc","1485000","1489000"," And I was hanging out with him in Finn to it during GME."
"liXizlLECHc","1489000","1492000"," And we would just sit there and talk to each other."
"liXizlLECHc","1492000","1496000"," And I'm like, watch these guys. These guys have hundred thousand followers, five hundred thousand followers."
"liXizlLECHc","1496000","1499000"," These guys are wall streeters. These guys are hedge fund guys."
"liXizlLECHc","1499000","1503000"," These are guys that are financial advisors. These guys are these guys know everything."
"liXizlLECHc","1503000","1506000"," These guys, these are the smartest brains on Finn to it."
"liXizlLECHc","1506000","1513000"," And we just sat back and fucking laughed at these fucking people because they had no idea what the fuck they were talking about."
"liXizlLECHc","1513000","1514000"," None."
"liXizlLECHc","1514000","1518000"," And they have no idea what they're talking about here either. They have no idea what they're talking about the zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","1518000","1524000"," They're gonna make some shit up that sounds smart. And it's just not real. It's fake."
"liXizlLECHc","1524000","1531000"," It's fake. And when I watched GME squeeze the first time, it like went through a process."
"liXizlLECHc","1531000","1534000"," It's nothing disregarded."
"liXizlLECHc","1534000","1539000"," Okay, let's try to explain it away now. Okay, let me throw some smart shit out there."
"liXizlLECHc","1539000","1543000"," Okay, let me get angry on Finn to it."
"liXizlLECHc","1543000","1547000"," And then, okay, I'll join in now once it's at five hundred dollars."
"liXizlLECHc","1547000","1554000"," And then as soon as the last squeeze happened and the people, the original DOJ's new, it was never coming up but coming back again."
"liXizlLECHc","1554000","1560000"," And when they pulled the plug, you saw these same people try to dismiss it as quickly as possible."
"liXizlLECHc","1561000","1568000"," And the truth is in the background, all these smart people were screaming at their own people saying, figure out how they did this."
"liXizlLECHc","1568000","1571000"," And then they started to trade the market like that."
"liXizlLECHc","1571000","1576000"," They don't tell you that publicly, but that's what happened."
"liXizlLECHc","1576000","1582000"," Some of you may have been there before. I don't mean before Wall Street bets got a 1.5 million followers."
"liXizlLECHc","1582000","1587000"," I'm talking about when it was like sub 150,000, 15,000 shit like that."
"liXizlLECHc","1587000","1593000"," Find, find, suspect the saboteur on Twitter and ask them about those days because it was fucking wild."
"liXizlLECHc","1593000","1597000"," Same shit going on."
"liXizlLECHc","1597000","1606000"," Same, same shit's going on right now by these by the same people trying to explain shit that they don't understand."
"liXizlLECHc","1607000","1616000"," So anyways, red red's over. So as a bear, what you want to be seeing here is you got a nice three, three trigger crossed over here above right."
"liXizlLECHc","1616000","1623000"," And what you want to be waiting for here is to see the reaction off of this hourly five minute and one minute."
"liXizlLECHc","1623000","1633000"," So in the background, I'm going to watch this and see if there's another place to try to get us down into Friday."
"liXizlLECHc","1634000","1640000"," We're going to look at the options chain right now for today and tomorrow."
"liXizlLECHc","1647000","1652000"," I wanted to freak out on Twitter last night. I was like, I'm going to sound like a raving lunatic."
"liXizlLECHc","1652000","1656000"," I'm like, I'm just going to, I'm not going to post anything on Fin to it tonight. I'm just going to be quiet."
"liXizlLECHc","1656000","1658000"," I'm going to sit down."
"liXizlLECHc","1658000","1661000"," And then I wrote like, I think I wrote three posts last night."
"liXizlLECHc","1661000","1666000"," And I'm like, nope, not posting that. Nope, not posting that. Nope, not posting that."
"liXizlLECHc","1669000","1676000"," Yeah, we got call buyers stepping in for tomorrow. 38,000 calls at 410 C. Unreal."
"liXizlLECHc","1679000","1685000"," We've got a bunch of calls right now. 90,000 calls at 410 C on today's expiry."
"liXizlLECHc","1685000","1687000"," Just buying it up."
"liXizlLECHc","1689000","1693000"," Remember, remember, what we told yesterday, if the call buyers don't show back up tomorrow."
"liXizlLECHc","1695000","1698000"," If the call buyers don't show back up to me, you know, like Armageddon, man."
"liXizlLECHc","1698000","1702000"," My good just crash. Crazy. Like these people have been set."
"liXizlLECHc","1702000","1707000"," This is like these people have been telling you that the bar crashes over. No."
"liXizlLECHc","1708000","1713000"," No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
"liXizlLECHc","1714000","1718000"," And now they're warning you that if the if the zero day call buyers don't show up,"
"liXizlLECHc","1718000","1721000"," that might crash the market. It's in say no."
"liXizlLECHc","1722000","1725000"," These aren't the people that told you in October or December,"
"liXizlLECHc","1725000","1727000"," or even this week that the market crashes over."
"liXizlLECHc","1727000","1730000"," None of these people have told you that we're in a bull market."
"liXizlLECHc","1730000","1733000"," All of them are looking for the last leg."
"liXizlLECHc","1733000","1737000"," All of them were positioned for the expiration to go down."
"liXizlLECHc","1737000","1742000"," All of them have been positioned to hit 360 or through or even 3060."
"liXizlLECHc","1742000","1747000"," All of them believe that we're in a market crash still and all of them will give you"
"liXizlLECHc","1747000","1749000"," any reason that they fucking possibly can."
"liXizlLECHc","1750000","1752000"," That they can try to get to stick."
"liXizlLECHc","1753000","1756000"," To get called zero day call buyers to stop buying zero day calls."
"liXizlLECHc","1757000","1759000"," It's bizarre."
"liXizlLECHc","1759000","1763000"," It's bizarre and it has nothing to do with the market goes up or down."
"liXizlLECHc","1764000","1765000"," None."
"liXizlLECHc","1766000","1768000"," Well, there's a small. There's a small. I know."
"liXizlLECHc","1768000","1773000"," I understand all of the mechanics of it with the nine to 10% of the options market swinging"
"liXizlLECHc","1773000","1777000"," when institutions are not buying and selling real money, buying real money,"
"liXizlLECHc","1777000","1778000"," selling."
"liXizlLECHc","1778000","1782000"," You know, all about the hedging on the market that tries to dampen volatility."
"liXizlLECHc","1782000","1784000"," Got the whole entire thing."
"liXizlLECHc","1784000","1788000"," Have conversations with some of you on the phone about this stuff way prior to this."
"liXizlLECHc","1788000","1790000"," So just bizarre."
"liXizlLECHc","1791000","1792000"," Straight bizarre."
"liXizlLECHc","1792000","1797000"," And they're here this morning buying you would have thought that today with the bad readings"
"liXizlLECHc","1797000","1799000"," this morning and the bad."
"liXizlLECHc","1799000","1802000"," The bad news that we get that they would have stopped buying calls this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","1802000","1803000"," They didn't."
"liXizlLECHc","1804000","1806000"," About them about zero days."
"liXizlLECHc","1806000","1810000"," Market wasn't even priced in for us to go lower than four or three four or five somewhere in"
"liXizlLECHc","1810000","1811000"," here this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","1812000","1814000"," So now we got to wait for the call buyers to go away."
"liXizlLECHc","1815000","1818000"," And everybody to get fearful and start buying."
"liXizlLECHc","1819000","1820000"," And stop."
"liXizlLECHc","1820000","1822000"," You can actually see us three is right here."
"liXizlLECHc","1822000","1824000"," Look how close S three is this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","1825000","1827000"," It's not even priced in for us to go lower."
"liXizlLECHc","1830000","1832000"," That's blowing my mind."
"liXizlLECHc","1834000","1837000"," I bet if you're a bear, you got to be pissed right now, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","1837000","1839000"," No, no possible way you're not pissed."
"liXizlLECHc","1840000","1841000"," Okay, so."
"liXizlLECHc","1844000","1847000"," As to about we're looking for a rejection above."
"liXizlLECHc","1847000","1853000"," I'm going to draw some boxes for you to look for rejection here so we can hopefully at least get another down day."
"liXizlLECHc","1854000","1858000"," And possibly another five to six sessions of down or at least."
"liXizlLECHc","1859000","1864000"," Squeeze is higher in some kind of a down capitulation moments wherever that price is."
"liXizlLECHc","1864000","1867000"," We're not seeing price velocity on."
"liXizlLECHc","1868000","1871000"," On the market breadth where we know that people are still long."
"liXizlLECHc","1871000","1874000"," This market underneath the surface."
"liXizlLECHc","1874000","1878000"," I would like to see us at least get to three ninety six if possible."
"liXizlLECHc","1879000","1886000"," If we can break through three ninety six even briefly, it would be even better if we can get down to like the three eighties and be stoked."
"liXizlLECHc","1887000","1889000"," To cool this market off a little bit."
"liXizlLECHc","1891000","1892000"," But I don't see it."
"liXizlLECHc","1893000","1896000"," I don't see us getting below three ninety six yet."
"liXizlLECHc","1896000","1898000"," I guess if we do will look for it, but."
"liXizlLECHc","1898000","1904000"," I would really like to see at least some sideways and down sideways trades cool off the market a little bit."
"liXizlLECHc","1905000","1908000"," I'm going to give you two or three places to look at this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","1910000","1912000"," First one is going to be four ten sixteen."
"liXizlLECHc","1922000","1923000"," Right here."
"liXizlLECHc","1924000","1926000"," Do you guys follow me on."
"liXizlLECHc","1929000","1930000"," Right there."
"liXizlLECHc","1934000","1938000"," I don't know if any of you follow me on at captains alphon fin to it."
"liXizlLECHc","1938000","1940000"," Last night at eight o'clock."
"liXizlLECHc","1940000","1943000"," I was in the phone with Chaz late night last night."
"liXizlLECHc","1943000","1949000"," And I'm like, man, I'm like, I'm looking for any reason that these people are right."
"liXizlLECHc","1949000","1952000"," I'm like, he's like, what are you doing? I'm like, this is like midnight last night."
"liXizlLECHc","1952000","1957000"," I'm like, I'm just trying to look for anything these people are saying that I'm missing."
"liXizlLECHc","1958000","1968000"," For eleven seventy two. So I spent late last night looking for anything and."
"liXizlLECHc","1968000","1972000"," Normally, under normal circumstances."
"liXizlLECHc","1972000","1974000"," You can see."
"liXizlLECHc","1974000","1979000"," If the so if we're going to have a market crap true market crash, normally."
"liXizlLECHc","1979000","1983000"," Unless it's an unless it's an unknown event."
"liXizlLECHc","1983000","1986000"," Right. This is something that's not priced into the market."
"liXizlLECHc","1987000","1993000"," I'm not going to name those events, but I guess I will like an example would be nine eleven."
"liXizlLECHc","1993000","1996000"," Was unexpected to our stock market."
"liXizlLECHc","1997000","2004000"," So if you have an event like that, right, you can actually look back in time and see those events when they unfold."
"liXizlLECHc","2004000","2007000"," That the banks were not able to get out."
"liXizlLECHc","2007000","2011000"," Before that those those those those market crashes happened."
"liXizlLECHc","2011000","2014000"," But there are most of the crashes, though, you can actually see."
"liXizlLECHc","2015000","2022000"," You can actually see the banks divest themselves of this market before price follows."
"liXizlLECHc","2022000","2029000"," So you can actually see them selling and in price either diverge or maintain."
"liXizlLECHc","2029000","2034000"," And I haven't I'm not seeing it in the background. I'm not seeing."
"liXizlLECHc","2034000","2041000"," That same structure. I'm not seeing the structure leading up in December and January of twenty twenty two."
"liXizlLECHc","2041000","2046000"," I'm not seeing the same structure at all on the market right now."
"liXizlLECHc","2046000","2050000"," It could unfold over time, but I haven't seen it right now."
"liXizlLECHc","2050000","2056000"," And you can look back historically and you can actually define."
"liXizlLECHc","2056000","2058000"," You can you can actually define."
"liXizlLECHc","2058000","2064000"," You are not defined, but you can look back and say, oh, you can see how breath was leaving the market."
"liXizlLECHc","2064000","2068000"," And price stayed high as a crash was about to happen."
"liXizlLECHc","2068000","2072000"," You can actually see when these banks buy the market going all the way up."
"liXizlLECHc","2072000","2077000"," Then you can see them selling the market right before we crash."
"liXizlLECHc","2077000","2082000"," And you can see it historically right back to the start of the beginning thing is the stock market."
"liXizlLECHc","2082000","2085000"," And so I'm not seeing it right now."
"liXizlLECHc","2085000","2090000"," So I guess they can't tell you if we're going to get a zero day crash."
"liXizlLECHc","2090000","2094000"," But we know for a fact that these zero day buyers are not retailers."
"liXizlLECHc","2095000","2100000"," So my assumption, I'm assuming at this point that if we do get a zero day crash."
"liXizlLECHc","2100000","2103000"," But you would still see it behind the scenes."
"liXizlLECHc","2103000","2106000"," You would see these same bank saying, okay, we're going to stop buying."
"liXizlLECHc","2106000","2114000"," Well, this is the positive from market watch and been to it at large."
"liXizlLECHc","2114000","2118000"," That it could be a crash that no one sees, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2118000","2120000"," These are the things that market crashes are made of."
"liXizlLECHc","2120000","2123000"," So I'm like, okay, well, if that's the case, more than likely these people know what they're doing."
"liXizlLECHc","2123000","2127000"," And they're going to foresee or foreshadow this market crash."
"liXizlLECHc","2127000","2130000"," And so the program divests themselves at some point."
"liXizlLECHc","2130000","2135000"," So I haven't seen them divests themselves at the scale that they should be."
"liXizlLECHc","2135000","2138000"," And now let's say they don't and we get the crash."
"liXizlLECHc","2138000","2140000"," We'll know then. Yeah. Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","2140000","2142000"," It was zero dates and we fucked up."
"liXizlLECHc","2142000","2146000"," But for right now, these guys are these guys are doing both."
"liXizlLECHc","2146000","2150000"," They're buying and they're trading the zero day market."
"liXizlLECHc","2150000","2152000"," And what we'll explain."
"liXizlLECHc","2152000","2156000"," Different different reasons that is happening."
"liXizlLECHc","2156000","2160000"," And why it's happening and the rise of it."
"liXizlLECHc","2160000","2164000"," The rise of it was actually the prediction of it was actually in 2018."
"liXizlLECHc","2164000","2166000"," Not 2020."
"liXizlLECHc","2166000","2168000"," Not 2021."
"liXizlLECHc","2168000","2170000"," Not 2022."
"liXizlLECHc","2170000","2174000"," And the rise of zero date buyers, they don't just by calls."
"liXizlLECHc","2174000","2176000"," They by put to."
"liXizlLECHc","2176000","2178000"," So we'll talk about all that."
"liXizlLECHc","2178000","2182000"," I'll show you the facts on that at some point this morning in the discussion on that."
"liXizlLECHc","2182000","2184000"," The two place many years ago."
"liXizlLECHc","2184000","2187000"," So we'll get into that this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","2187000","2189000"," We're going to go way back in the time machine."
"liXizlLECHc","2189000","2195000"," And this is when this is actually thought about discussed by professionals."
"liXizlLECHc","2195000","2196000"," Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","2196000","2201000"," So we're looking for rejection here right off the five minute almost to the to the pin right here."
"liXizlLECHc","2201000","2206000"," We are getting some kind of a cluster forming to go higher."
"liXizlLECHc","2207000","2212000"," We'll see if they take it up higher here. This is really the one right here that bears want to sell."
"liXizlLECHc","2212000","2215000"," You want to sell this red one right up here."
"liXizlLECHc","2215000","2219000"," If you guys follow me on that captain's alpha got a reading last night."
"liXizlLECHc","2219000","2224000"," About eight o'clock at night for while I was researching last night got a reading in this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","2224000","2230000"," I woke up in a in a fervor and I posted on that captain's alpha that took spec five to six sessions down."
"liXizlLECHc","2230000","2232000"," That would be my expectation at this point."
"liXizlLECHc","2232000","2239000"," So you'd see five to five. So maybe this end of this week and then next week could be sideways and down."
"liXizlLECHc","2239000","2242000"," So I don't see price velocity being a factor at this point."
"liXizlLECHc","2242000","2246000"," Hold on a second here."
"liXizlLECHc","2246000","2250000"," If you don't follow me on that captain's alpha you can request the follow."
"liXizlLECHc","2250000","2257000"," And I let everyone in as long I just I use it to make sure I keep the bots out of there because they're all over Twitter."
"liXizlLECHc","2257000","2263000"," And I don't want the the bots on my on my alpha channel."
"liXizlLECHc","2263000","2270000"," I ship post on vintuit but I try to keep this handle for just straight."
"liXizlLECHc","2270000","2276000"," Straight posting with data that that supports where the market is headed."
"liXizlLECHc","2276000","2279000"," You can actually go through the profile and go through and see everything that I post there."
"liXizlLECHc","2279000","2286000"," I also post levels every day there as well. If you don't get those see me putting them up every morning here."
"liXizlLECHc","2286000","2290000"," It's the same data that I'm put our post in there as well every morning."
"liXizlLECHc","2290000","2298000"," I know that you guys pay for that shit from other services you guys pay people 30 50 bucks a month 15 10 bucks a month to get your levels every day."
"liXizlLECHc","2298000","2306000"," Now they're they're free at captain's alpha."
"liXizlLECHc","2306000","2308000"," Here we go."
"liXizlLECHc","2308000","2314000"," We got more people this morning. I'll get you all you guys in there right now."
"liXizlLECHc","2314000","2319000"," Right through my profile and read a bunch of posts they got some cool posts in there."
"liXizlLECHc","2319000","2325000"," I posted a post recently about XL Y XL C."
"liXizlLECHc","2325000","2332000"," A bunch of others way back on me look at that one that was pretty cool."
"liXizlLECHc","2332000","2338000"," Sometimes there's some misses but not many you're talking like of 10 posts maybe."
"liXizlLECHc","2338000","2343000"," Maybe one or two of them are wrong, but other than that they're they're fucking spot on."
"liXizlLECHc","2343000","2348000"," So you guys are in there. All right, hold on a second here."
"liXizlLECHc","2348000","2359000"," And the other post that I put in there was SDOW calls. So let's look at SDOW real quick."
"liXizlLECHc","2360000","2363000"," A couple of things to look at here because I did post but SDOW."
"liXizlLECHc","2363000","2366000"," And we'll talk about that one this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","2366000","2371000"," Let me see here."
"liXizlLECHc","2371000","2376000"," So get SDOW. It's one of my favorite market hedges."
"liXizlLECHc","2376000","2378000"," We'll put it there."
"liXizlLECHc","2378000","2379000"," See here."
"liXizlLECHc","2379000","2384000"," Just a second."
"liXizlLECHc","2384000","2386000"," Excuse me."
"liXizlLECHc","2386000","2391000"," Got a very sore throat this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","2391000","2399000"," Yeah, I like this. Okay, so let's look at SDOW."
"liXizlLECHc","2399000","2407000"," It's a one minute chart on SDOW right now."
"liXizlLECHc","2407000","2410000"," And SDOW is trying to work itself up, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2411000","2415000"," Trying to hold. It's got a nice bit of a cluster back here on Friday the 10th."
"liXizlLECHc","2415000","2418000"," Got a great cluster back here. Three trigger cluster right here."
"liXizlLECHc","2418000","2426000"," And it's coming on support on a four trigger cluster might take some time for the market to roll here."
"liXizlLECHc","2426000","2432000"," But what you want to see on SDOW is this support come up."
"liXizlLECHc","2432000","2436000"," This support come up and cross over the support."
"liXizlLECHc","2436000","2439000"," Let's see some kind of consolidation in here."
"liXizlLECHc","2439000","2444000"," Let me see if I can change this here."
"liXizlLECHc","2444000","2449000"," You want to see some kind of a consolidation here and hopefully we can get some some rips higher at some point."
"liXizlLECHc","2449000","2457000"," We'll look at it on a larger timeframe as well."
"liXizlLECHc","2457000","2461000"," Trying to fight its way up here."
"liXizlLECHc","2461000","2464000"," Now with this trade."
"liXizlLECHc","2464000","2467000"," It's a great consolidation back here for SDOW."
"liXizlLECHc","2467000","2473000"," And what I really like to see here is you see how it comes up."
"liXizlLECHc","2473000","2475000"," And then it gets slapped right back down, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2475000","2478000"," Comes up, slapped right back down, comes up, slapped right back down."
"liXizlLECHc","2478000","2483000"," So you really don't want to be taking an SDOW call right here, do you?"
"liXizlLECHc","2483000","2484000"," They don't really work."
"liXizlLECHc","2484000","2493000"," What you really want to see though is SDOW be able to hold 2542 and find some kind of consolidation."
"liXizlLECHc","2493000","2498000"," And you should be able to get at least 28 off of it, at least in the short in the short term."
"liXizlLECHc","2498000","2501000"," 28 would be nice."
"liXizlLECHc","2501000","2506000"," Yeah, I'd say 28 flat, maybe a 27 or a 26 call."
"liXizlLECHc","2506000","2513000"," We'll take a look at those this morning and see if we can get those and see if there's a way to hedge the market."
"liXizlLECHc","2513000","2517000"," One of my favorite parts about this hedge, it's triple levered."
"liXizlLECHc","2517000","2522000"," So if you put some time on them, one, three months, sometimes even six months,"
"liXizlLECHc","2522000","2526000"," they don't really react to intraday moves in the market."
"liXizlLECHc","2526000","2531000"," If the market goes up, one percent down percent, two percent, one percent up, one percent down."
"liXizlLECHc","2531000","2535000"," It tends to not destroy those options for myself."
"liXizlLECHc","2535000","2542000"," And I also am usually looking for interest on specific strikes when I buy that hedge."
"liXizlLECHc","2542000","2548000"," So if I see that there's a high concentration on one strike, a month, three months, six months out,"
"liXizlLECHc","2548000","2553000"," I'm trying not to stay on strikes that no one else is in because it's not a highly traded hedge."
"liXizlLECHc","2553000","2557000"," I want to be with the other people and get off the bus before they do."
"liXizlLECHc","2557000","2560000"," Get on the bus with them and then get off the bus before them, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2560000","2564000"," Some of the last bag holders, some of you have to watch if we do make a large market move."
"liXizlLECHc","2564000","2569000"," So let's say we've got a spike, let's say, or let's say we've got a spike in an SDOW."
"liXizlLECHc","2569000","2571000"," I'm trying to get out like right here."
"liXizlLECHc","2572000","2575000"," Take my money and run."
"liXizlLECHc","2575000","2583000"," And as the bus is unloading up here, I'm not getting stuck as a bag holder until the next squeeze higher."
"liXizlLECHc","2583000","2584000"," Makes sense."
"liXizlLECHc","2584000","2585000"," The bus is up here."
"liXizlLECHc","2585000","2593000"," There's still people on it, and I'm trying to get off the bus one stop before everybody else."
"liXizlLECHc","2593000","2595000"," Let's look at an SDOW and see how I can go."
"liXizlLECHc","2595000","2596000"," It's a great market hedge."
"liXizlLECHc","2596000","2604000"," That's actually a great hedge for, it's actually a great hedge for, for in case we get the zero"
"liXizlLECHc","2604000","2605000"," date bomb again."
"liXizlLECHc","2605000","2606000"," And that's the other funny pattern."
"liXizlLECHc","2606000","2608000"," You know, here's the other funny pattern with the bomb again."
"liXizlLECHc","2608000","2613000"," So yesterday we were talking about, I was talking to you about how the market's not pricing in,"
"liXizlLECHc","2613000","2617000"," moved to 4.22, and I think I moved to 4.02, something like that."
"liXizlLECHc","2617000","2619000"," I haven't written down here."
"liXizlLECHc","2619000","2620000"," I said we'd pay for trade it."
"liXizlLECHc","2621000","2629000"," It was a 404, 404 P, I think, and 4.22 C."
"liXizlLECHc","2629000","2632000"," And I said, I said, oh, the market's not pricing this shit in."
"liXizlLECHc","2632000","2633000"," They're like worthless."
"liXizlLECHc","2633000","2635000"," I was like, that's, that's not right."
"liXizlLECHc","2635000","2636000"," Something's wrong here."
"liXizlLECHc","2636000","2637000"," And let's stay together."
"liXizlLECHc","2637000","2638000"," And he's going to win."
"liXizlLECHc","2638000","2645000"," But the most ironic part about a bomb again event, because we've got one coming up already, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2645000","2648000"," We've got the debt ceiling of all McGadden events, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2648000","2650000"," Yeah, I guess we call it that, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2650000","2653000"," Last time we had a, last time we had a debt ceiling crisis."
"liXizlLECHc","2653000","2655000"," We went into June and the market went like this."
"liXizlLECHc","2655000","2656000"," It was like straight into June."
"liXizlLECHc","2656000","2659000"," And then it went straight down to the depths of hell."
"liXizlLECHc","2659000","2661000"," So I'm like, okay."
"liXizlLECHc","2661000","2663000"," So how do I, how do I hedge that, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2663000","2664000"," Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","2664000","2665000"," I'll buy a zero."
"liXizlLECHc","2665000","2666000"," I'll buy a penny."
"liXizlLECHc","2666000","2669000"," Put a literal penny put."
"liXizlLECHc","2669000","2673000"," And then how do you hedge zero date Armageddon?"
"liXizlLECHc","2673000","2677000"," Oh, well, every call I buy, I guess, on the spy."
"liXizlLECHc","2677000","2679000"," I'll just buy a penny fucking put, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2679000","2682000"," That should do it, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2682000","2689000"," So if I buy like a 30 cent call on the spy, you're telling me that I can buy a weekly penny put"
"liXizlLECHc","2689000","2695000"," or a bunch of weekly penny puts for, I'll spend $100 on penny puts and then you're telling me they're going to print 10 grand, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2695000","2697000"," That's what you're telling me."
"liXizlLECHc","2697000","2698000"," If we have risk of that, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2698000","2701000"," So just buy a penny put every, every week."
"liXizlLECHc","2702000","2704000"," To hedge the zero date massacre that's on the way."
"liXizlLECHc","2704000","2705000"," Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","2705000","2706000"," So it's a penny, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2706000","2710000"," When I buy puts or calls, should I lose 10 cents?"
"liXizlLECHc","2710000","2711000"," All the fucking time."
"liXizlLECHc","2711000","2713000"," So what's a penny for a week?"
"liXizlLECHc","2713000","2714000"," I don't know."
"liXizlLECHc","2714000","2716000"," I don't know what these people are trying to say."
"liXizlLECHc","2716000","2718000"," I don't know the logic behind."
"liXizlLECHc","2718000","2724000"," I don't understand the logic behind this lunacy that's being screamed."
"liXizlLECHc","2724000","2726000"," So I guess that's what I'll do, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2727000","2730000"," I was looking at 402s yesterday, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2730000","2731000"," 404s?"
"liXizlLECHc","2731000","2734000"," I was looking at 404s yesterday to cost the pennies."
"liXizlLECHc","2734000","2738000"," So I was like, oh shit, let's start strangling the market."
"liXizlLECHc","2738000","2740000"," We'll start strangling the market."
"liXizlLECHc","2740000","2741000"," Let's just start."
"liXizlLECHc","2741000","2744000"," We'll fucking add some cheap ass puts on every time we buy a call."
"liXizlLECHc","2744000","2747000"," On a high, I'll add some puts on."
"liXizlLECHc","2747000","2749000"," I'm going to take this long."
"liXizlLECHc","2749000","2754000"," We'll just add some puts because they're dirt fucking cheap."
"liXizlLECHc","2755000","2764000"," How are you guys doing out there?"
"liXizlLECHc","2764000","2778000"," Yeah, it looks so yesterday's market looked like when we were looking at yesterday's market,"
"liXizlLECHc","2778000","2781000"," it was looking like."
"liXizlLECHc","2781000","2783000"," I asked the question on Fintuit."
"liXizlLECHc","2783000","2786000"," I said, this state again going to win this."
"liXizlLECHc","2786000","2789000"," On Fintuit yesterday, I asked the state again."
"liXizlLECHc","2789000","2792000"," When I wasn't joking, I was being very, very serious in that post."
"liXizlLECHc","2792000","2794000"," And people thought I was kidding."
"liXizlLECHc","2794000","2797000"," And I'm like, no, I'm like, I'm looking at the options chain right now."
"liXizlLECHc","2797000","2800000"," And like all the high calls are worthless."
"liXizlLECHc","2800000","2804000"," All the, all the, even the puts at 404 were worthless."
"liXizlLECHc","2804000","2805000"," And it just made sense."
"liXizlLECHc","2805000","2810000"," Like it's a 50, I think it was a 56, it was a 58 cent trade yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","2811000","2817000"," So I'm like, uh, 58 cent trade to, to pick these calls and puts up days out, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2817000","2820000"," Three freestrikes out or three, uh, three opeks is out."
"liXizlLECHc","2820000","2824000"," I can buy penny fucking puts and penny fucking calls."
"liXizlLECHc","2824000","2827000"," So I thought that was bizarre."
"liXizlLECHc","2827000","2832000"," And so what it's implying is that we're not making a huge move down."
"liXizlLECHc","2832000","2833000"," Right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2833000","2835000"," We're not making a huge move up either."
"liXizlLECHc","2835000","2839000"," We're going to, we're going to try to range and they're going to torch and someone just posted."
"liXizlLECHc","2839000","2840000"," Um, Omar just posted."
"liXizlLECHc","2840000","2845000"," There's, uh, 130,000 zero dates expiring today at four, uh, 410."
"liXizlLECHc","2845000","2847000"," It's just 10 22 in the morning."
"liXizlLECHc","2847000","2848000"," Yeah."
"liXizlLECHc","2848000","2849000"," You see it, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2849000","2851000"," You see it, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2851000","2854000"," They did this shit when we're going down to you."
"liXizlLECHc","2854000","2861000"," So when we're going down in 2022, we'd be sitting here and you, they would hold the market up with calls."
"liXizlLECHc","2861000","2863000"," Zero date calls, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","2863000","2865000"," You can actually watch the option chain."
"liXizlLECHc","2865000","2867000"," Although you know, I'm going to give some credit to."
"liXizlLECHc","2868000","2878000"," Was, um, I think it's ball whiz or I think ball whiz or, um, Spock, Emma said, made a very clear point that people don't realize."
"liXizlLECHc","2878000","2882000"," Uh, and that is the, uh, intraday implied ball."
"liXizlLECHc","2882000","2887000"," Is not calculated into, um, the IO of options."
"liXizlLECHc","2887000","2891000"," So you won't see like people were like, well, I didn't see these."
"liXizlLECHc","2891000","2892000"," I didn't see those."
"liXizlLECHc","2892000","2894000"," And I'm like, no, they don't calculate that shit."
"liXizlLECHc","2894000","2899000"," When they, when they come in the market with zero dates, you won't see them register anywhere."
"liXizlLECHc","2899000","2908000"," So you like, you won't see like, when you see me here in streaming, I'll say, hey, look, they just bought 300,000 fucking calls or, hey, look, they just bought 300,000 fucking puts."
"liXizlLECHc","2908000","2910000"," That shit doesn't register anywhere."
"liXizlLECHc","2910000","2913000"," It doesn't get calculated into anything else."
"liXizlLECHc","2913000","2914000"," And it's like a thumb."
"liXizlLECHc","2914000","2920000"," There's like an algorithm at a bank that puts a thumb on the market and says, I want it to hold."
"liXizlLECHc","2920000","2921000"," I want it to go down."
"liXizlLECHc","2921000","2923000"," I want it to go up."
"liXizlLECHc","2923000","2927000"," And they literally massage and manage the market."
"liXizlLECHc","2927000","2929000"," You'll also see the spreads come in."
"liXizlLECHc","2929000","2934000"," You'll see both sides come in. You'll see puts and calls come in. You'll see, uh, two sides on just calls."
"liXizlLECHc","2934000","2941000"," Two strikes away. It's usually like, it's like right now, you'll see like, uh, four 11 calls and four 13 calls come in."
"liXizlLECHc","2941000","2946000"," Uh, same time they'll hold both and they'll let one side off and ride the rest up."
"liXizlLECHc","2946000","2952000"," You'll see them come in and hold calls and puts and then depending upon the direct, like if we have real money buying a real money selling."
"liXizlLECHc","2952000","2955000"," They'll pull one side off and ride the other way up the white way up."
"liXizlLECHc","2955000","2957000"," And that's it's been going on for years."
"liXizlLECHc","2957000","2961000"," Now the size has increased over the past three to five years."
"liXizlLECHc","2961000","2970000"," Um, but it's been going on for many, many, many years before there were, it seems like it doesn't seem like it's scaling."
"liXizlLECHc","2970000","2975000"," It doesn't seem like it's scaling with, um, like, like bizarrely."
"liXizlLECHc","2975000","2985000"," It just seems like the options market has grown. And so they've had to increase their size, uh, to maintain control of where they want the market to go."
"liXizlLECHc","2985000","2994000"," I know some of this is a hedging for, uh, for, for, for structured, um, uh, call spreads that they're in, put spreads, they're ready, they're selling or buying."
"liXizlLECHc","2994000","2996000"," But there's another part to this."
"liXizlLECHc","2996000","3003000"," And this other part is more than likely an algorithm from a bank that's trying to, uh,"
"liXizlLECHc","3003000","3009000"," dead and volatility in the market. And they've always done it. It's not like it's never been done. It's been done for years."
"liXizlLECHc","3009000","3013000"," I'm talking years, like six, seven, eight, nine years that I've been."
"liXizlLECHc","3013000","3017000"," I think I've been trading option or not options, but zero dates."
"liXizlLECHc","3017000","3021000"," Uh, at least six, seven years and it's, it's always been there."
"liXizlLECHc","3021000","3025000"," And the options market has grown over those years."
"liXizlLECHc","3025000","3032000"," Uh, so for them to need to increase their side and then you've seen me on this program at times, say, I don't know if it's dealers that are doing it."
"liXizlLECHc","3032000","3035000"," Could be dealers just not telling you."
"liXizlLECHc","3035000","3041000"," Uh, could be, could be weaponized gamma. No one wants to admit to that."
"liXizlLECHc","3041000","3048000"," Uh, I believe in the weaponized gamma aspect to it that there's a thumb on the market being lifted and put on the market."
"liXizlLECHc","3048000","3054000"," Uh, you can actually see it happen, uh, with price, with, with the actual price and the options market."
"liXizlLECHc","3054000","3060000"," Now you guys know about them being like long, let's say, uh, tech stock and this is another fascinating thing."
"liXizlLECHc","3060000","3065000"," Uh, ball brought up was, uh, that Fridays."
"liXizlLECHc","3065000","3067000"," This is really, this is really cool."
"liXizlLECHc","3067000","3070000"," I gotta give him fucking credit. This guy is smart as fuck."
"liXizlLECHc","3070000","3079000"," Uh, I don't know if I should say this or not, but he was like, he was like, I'm, he's like, I'm fascinated to see what happens on Friday."
"liXizlLECHc","3079000","3084000"," Because tech doesn't have, uh, zero date expiration every day of the week."
"liXizlLECHc","3084000","3088000"," But guess when they do have zero dates on fucking Friday."
"liXizlLECHc","3088000","3098000"," And we keep seeing Friday's rip higher, right? So if we're seeing Friday's rip higher, why is that especially tech rips higher in Friday, which ends up carrying the spy up."
"liXizlLECHc","3098000","3103000"," Uh, his point was, uh, you don't like you've got tech traders."
"liXizlLECHc","3103000","3106000"," Tech speculators."
"liXizlLECHc","3106000","3111000"," That might let's say by, I don't know, a Tesla."
"liXizlLECHc","3111000","3115000"," Or an apple or something where they've been living right next to, um."
"liXizlLECHc","3116000","3121000"," Spec growth now since October, right? December, right in spec growth."
"liXizlLECHc","3121000","3125000"," Some of it like Tesla's been written since when December."
"liXizlLECHc","3125000","3130000"," And so, uh, if they're trying to pump those prices up."
"liXizlLECHc","3130000","3134000"," Uh, they're using weaponized game and they come inside of the options on Friday."
"liXizlLECHc","3134000","3138000"," And they manipulate the market to get their underlying to move higher."
"liXizlLECHc","3138000","3144000"," These aren't retailers, man. These aren't hedge funds. These, well, they can be hedge funds, some larger hedge funds."
"liXizlLECHc","3145000","3152000"," Smaller banks with risk on through hedge fund or maybe a large bank with, with risk on through, through hedge fund."
"liXizlLECHc","3162000","3167000"," Yeah, we should, we should go squeeze squeeze up here. It's red bars where, um, we're watching here."
"liXizlLECHc","3167000","3170000"," So I'll let me show you this here. So I'm watching in the background."
"liXizlLECHc","3170000","3174000"," There's not much going on right now than the squeeze higher. And so what you're seeing here."
"liXizlLECHc","3174000","3181000"," Is, uh, you want to, you want to see this green, this five minutes, one minute come up to this resistance area."
"liXizlLECHc","3181000","3185000"," And there should be a trade higher to, uh, sorry, run one. My bad."
"liXizlLECHc","3185000","3187000"," It's going to look similar. I should say."
"liXizlLECHc","3191000","3192000"," Thank you."
"liXizlLECHc","3197000","3199000"," I want you to watch this closely here."
"liXizlLECHc","3201000","3207000"," Price is above the one in the five minutes, bullish. Just so you know, this is bullish. You want to see the crossover."
"liXizlLECHc","3207000","3212000"," Of the, um, I'm saying I'm watching this in the background and I was watching fucking esta."
"liXizlLECHc","3212000","3218000"," Um, so you're going to watch this, this white one here red one crossover price is above right now. So it's very bullish."
"liXizlLECHc","3218000","3226000"," And we're looking for a rejection above here at four 12ish right around there. So we'll see if we get that rejection or not. We will, we'll know here."
"liXizlLECHc","3227000","3229000"," We're going to know here if we get a rejection."
"liXizlLECHc","3229000","3234000"," Or if we're going to have a continuation higher. So what you're looking for here."
"liXizlLECHc","3234000","3236000"," Is you're looking for."
"liXizlLECHc","3236000","3241000"," Either rejection here or a trade higher. So."
"liXizlLECHc","3241000","3244000"," Let me see if I can figure this out for you."
"liXizlLECHc","3244000","3245000"," There you go."
"liXizlLECHc","3245000","3248000"," Now you want to see if we get a rejection right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3248000","3252000"," Uh, on the five and the one."
"liXizlLECHc","3252000","3254000"," Should be right around here coming up."
"liXizlLECHc","3255000","3259000"," Now if the price goes above the hourly and the five and one minute."
"liXizlLECHc","3259000","3264000"," Uh, we can take a trade for this higher actually to squeeze nice and fat and high."
"liXizlLECHc","3264000","3267000"," And do a return to the scene of the crime at four 13 51."
"liXizlLECHc","3267000","3271000"," Uh, so why let this play out right here? And if it does get bearish at any point."
"liXizlLECHc","3271000","3274000"," Uh, for a trade lower, uh, we will take it."
"liXizlLECHc","3277000","3281000"," You guys want to just leave this up for you and put the book map up so you can."
"liXizlLECHc","3281000","3285000"," Uh, see it in real time. I'll put it up right now for you so you can see it."
"liXizlLECHc","3285000","3288000"," You can watch how it plays out."
"liXizlLECHc","3290000","3293000"," I'll write a, I'll leave a couple boxes here for you."
"liXizlLECHc","3296000","3299000"," This would be a long trade right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3299000","3301000"," Above if we can get above."
"liXizlLECHc","3303000","3309000"," And then we've got a, uh, a short trade right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3312000","3316000"," And we'll see if we can get this bearish crossover and come back down."
"liXizlLECHc","3317000","3323000"," If you're looking for the bearish crossover, you're going to be looking for, um, this to happen right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3326000","3329000"," And this to happen right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3334000","3340000"," I was talking with someone after the program yesterday about taking, uh, getting in a position."
"liXizlLECHc","3340000","3345000"," And he was saying they got cut up and hold on a second here."
"liXizlLECHc","3346000","3348000"," And how do you not get cut up?"
"liXizlLECHc","3348000","3351000"," And I was trying to explain a way to get cut up, but there's an even easier way."
"liXizlLECHc","3351000","3354000"," And that would be where you wait for confirmation."
"liXizlLECHc","3354000","3358000"," Um, you know, if you want, if you want to take a short here, you could just wait till you blast through here."
"liXizlLECHc","3359000","3362000"," And, uh, then you, you would take the trade right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3363000","3364000"," Somewhere in here."
"liXizlLECHc","3365000","3367000"," I'm not mess with any of this stuff here."
"liXizlLECHc","3368000","3370000"," So watch as it plays out."
"liXizlLECHc","3374000","3379000"," You want to watch this white line cross above the red that would, uh, show continuation to the upside."
"liXizlLECHc","3380000","3382000"," Uh, 411 75 right now is looking like a target."
"liXizlLECHc","3384000","3385000"," 411 75."
"liXizlLECHc","3387000","3388000"," Somewhere in there."
"liXizlLECHc","3388000","3389000"," It's four 11 50."
"liXizlLECHc","3394000","3395000"," How's everybody doing?"
"liXizlLECHc","3397000","3398000"," Yeah, book maps up right now."
"liXizlLECHc","3400000","3401000"," I'm missing something on book map here."
"liXizlLECHc","3404000","3405000"," One here."
"liXizlLECHc","3407000","3409000"," See those sellers waiting above."
"liXizlLECHc","3412000","3415000"," That, that orange line that you see is right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3416000","3417000"," Right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3423000","3424000"," There'll be a retest."
"liXizlLECHc","3425000","3427000"," At 410 26."
"liXizlLECHc","3428000","3429000"," We'll look at that one real quick."
"liXizlLECHc","3431000","3434000"," So 410 26, you'll see a retest here."
"liXizlLECHc","3435000","3436000"," So you end up seeing this come back down."
"liXizlLECHc","3438000","3440000"," And we're either going to take the trade higher."
"liXizlLECHc","3441000","3445000"," And if we break below this retest here, this would be where you'd enter your short right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3446000","3447000"," Now for the next leg lower."
"liXizlLECHc","3448000","3452000"," But otherwise it is long baby long into four."
"liXizlLECHc","3454000","3455000"," Let me see if it gets right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3459000","3460000"," 411 78."
"liXizlLECHc","3462000","3466000"," Well, this I'll just, I'll just give you a target up here right to this box."
"liXizlLECHc","3468000","3469000"," Target."
"liXizlLECHc","3473000","3474000"," Right there."
"liXizlLECHc","3477000","3484000"," Wherever the yellow line is right there."
"liXizlLECHc","3491000","3492000"," There's S one."
"liXizlLECHc","3494000","3495000"," Here's the pivot."
"liXizlLECHc","3496000","3499000"," And today negative positive gamma."
"liXizlLECHc","3500000","3501000"," And."
"liXizlLECHc","3504000","3505000"," I'll make this the H one."
"liXizlLECHc","3507000","3520000"," That right there for you so you can see it."
"liXizlLECHc","3525000","3528000"," This is the target above that's on."
"liXizlLECHc","3532000","3533000"," On the other screener that I have."
"liXizlLECHc","3538000","3539000"," The one minute is now crossing the five minute."
"liXizlLECHc","3540000","3541000"," It's looking bullish at this point."
"liXizlLECHc","3548000","3549000"," Some questions here, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","3549000","3554000"," What goes into my decision to buy OTM versus close to the monies?"
"liXizlLECHc","3555000","3558000"," Well, first of all, yesterday somebody posted on been to it."
"liXizlLECHc","3559000","3560000"," They said, why is he always so bullish?"
"liXizlLECHc","3561000","3564000"," And it's not a it's not a question of me being bullish."
"liXizlLECHc","3564000","3569000"," It's a question of the function of the tools available."
"liXizlLECHc","3569000","3571000"," So I trade the spy."
"liXizlLECHc","3573000","3581000"," And because I trade the spy puts are not built to print unless it's very directional."
"liXizlLECHc","3582000","3586000"," So you have to be fast, like you have time when you buy the put."
"liXizlLECHc","3587000","3591000"," You need velocity in price on the downside to print, make them print."
"liXizlLECHc","3591000","3593000"," And then you need to close them for profit."
"liXizlLECHc","3594000","3600000"," They're very needy, I guess, would be the way that I would describe it."
"liXizlLECHc","3601000","3605000"," You have to pay attention to when your entry is, you have to hold them only for the move."
"liXizlLECHc","3605000","3609000"," You oftentimes get caught where they don't print, even if it goes in the direction you want them to."
"liXizlLECHc","3610000","3612000"," They're just not built. They were never intended to pay."
"liXizlLECHc","3613000","3615000"," Now puts on SPX do great."
"liXizlLECHc","3616000","3618000"," So those downside moves trade SPX."
"liXizlLECHc","3618000","3619000"," I think it's great."
"liXizlLECHc","3620000","3630000"," You're going to short futures, gobacks, great, you get paid very well with those products, but on the spy, the product itself and the downside doesn't pay well."
"liXizlLECHc","3631000","3633000"," So I'm not technically bullish."
"liXizlLECHc","3634000","3637000"," I'm just using the tools that pay best."
"liXizlLECHc","3638000","3645000"," And so I tend to wait for a dip to buy with calls that are structured to print heavily and hold their value."
"liXizlLECHc","3646000","3648000"," If there's pullbacks, they tend to."
"liXizlLECHc","3649000","3653000"," They tend to print better and there's more interest on the call side."
"liXizlLECHc","3654000","3658000"," And know that you guys are, if you're a bear, you have to know that you're not the largest."
"liXizlLECHc","3660000","3664000"," A group of interested parties in this market."
"liXizlLECHc","3665000","3668000"," I know it can seem like that, but most people are bulls."
"liXizlLECHc","3669000","3672000"," And so you have more people trading the call side, even more in a down market."
"liXizlLECHc","3672000","3678000"," You have more call buyers usually, more bullish traders and investors."
"liXizlLECHc","3679000","3681000"," If you look back, you don't have to explain this, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","3681000","3683000"," You guys just look at the stock market, it just goes up."
"liXizlLECHc","3684000","3687000"," You guys know over decades and decades, if you look, a market is built to go up."
"liXizlLECHc","3688000","3693000"," It's not built to be some fourth world country where it doesn't go up."
"liXizlLECHc","3694000","3700000"," So over time, I've done better on the call side than I have on the bear side."
"liXizlLECHc","3700000","3711000"," I've taken the bear side as a trader and I've been less successful on average than I have as a bullish trader on spy."
"liXizlLECHc","3712000","3713000"," So for me, that works for me."
"liXizlLECHc","3713000","3714000"," It might not work for you."
"liXizlLECHc","3714000","3716000"," Some of you guys out there call tops like crazy."
"liXizlLECHc","3717000","3718000"," I give you all the respect in the world."
"liXizlLECHc","3718000","3723000"," Some of you guys like I nailed it to the fucking pin when we're going to roll it over and nailed the bottom to the pin."
"liXizlLECHc","3723000","3725000"," I'm like, awesome, great for you."
"liXizlLECHc","3726000","3727000"," That's amazing."
"liXizlLECHc","3727000","3728000"," I've got nothing bad to say about that."
"liXizlLECHc","3728000","3738000"," But for me, I've made the most money as a call buyer buying dips, regardless of market, regardless of we're going down, regardless of going up."
"liXizlLECHc","3738000","3739000"," And I like that too."
"liXizlLECHc","3739000","3750000"," Oftentimes because it's more clearly defined when we're in a run, I run this over sold and over bought spreads and I used to do the put spreads in the top."
"liXizlLECHc","3751000","3758000"," And the top was always always stayed a rational longer in price was harder to nail down."
"liXizlLECHc","3759000","3765000"," Then on bottoms because bottoms tend to be on any time frame bottoms tend to be a capitulation move."
"liXizlLECHc","3767000","3769000"," Like statistically tend to be a capitulation move."
"liXizlLECHc","3769000","3776000"," Not always, but statistically in top statistically tend not to just immediately roll over and nose dive."
"liXizlLECHc","3776000","3782000"," They do when we squeeze higher, but they tend to remain rational longer in price."
"liXizlLECHc","3783000","3784000"," So it's just easier."
"liXizlLECHc","3785000","3795000"," I'll take, I'm not here to win a popularity contest on social media and be like, I'm not here to win that contest where I'm like, yeah, I'm shotgun tops."
"liXizlLECHc","3796000","3802000"," For internet cred, I'm here to make money with the easiest way to make money."
"liXizlLECHc","3802000","3803000"," That's what I'm here for."
"liXizlLECHc","3804000","3810000"," And when I, when I log off at the end of the day, when you log off the end of the day, ultimately you're here to make money."
"liXizlLECHc","3810000","3813000"," You're not here to win popularity contest with anybody."
"liXizlLECHc","3813000","3822000"," And I find that to be the easiest, the easiest thing to do is to find that bottom, wherever it is."
"liXizlLECHc","3823000","3828000"," Even during the COVID crash, those bought buying those bottoms, people don't want to tell you that either."
"liXizlLECHc","3828000","3830000"," They don't like telling you that."
"liXizlLECHc","3830000","3841000"," So if you have a real crash, you usually make a lot more money on buying bottoms as you, as you head down than you do on the, on the actual crash."
"liXizlLECHc","3842000","3846000"," So you do, if you're in the top, if you call a crash and you write it down, it's fucking print."
"liXizlLECHc","3846000","3849000"," But you can't close that shit out either."
"liXizlLECHc","3849000","3852000"," Ask people that, you can't really close that shit out."
"liXizlLECHc","3852000","3856000"," You just, you fucking diamond hand those fucking puts and you can't get out of them."
"liXizlLECHc","3857000","3861000"," And they, they, they increased in such value that you can't even get back in the market."
"liXizlLECHc","3861000","3870000"," Typically in those kind of, not, not that the controlled crashes that we had in 2022, but if you're real crash, you definitely have to diamond hand."
"liXizlLECHc","3870000","3877000"," Cause they, those contracts go like stupid thousand bucks, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000, 50,000."
"liXizlLECHc","3877000","3879000"," And you're just like diamond hand and the whole way down."
"liXizlLECHc","3879000","3885000"," And some people get caught where they, where we hit bottom and they don't actually get out of those put contracts, they go to zero."
"liXizlLECHc","3885000","3887000"," They lose all their money."
"liXizlLECHc","3887000","3890000"," Squeezing higher now to the H line."
"liXizlLECHc","3890000","3893000"," And we're going to see if the bears can get some rejection here."
"liXizlLECHc","3893000","3897000"," Bears are looking for rejection right here."
"liXizlLECHc","3897000","3901000"," So if you're in calls here, this is the danger zone."
"liXizlLECHc","3901000","3903000"," We're coming into it."
"liXizlLECHc","3903000","3909000"," Doesn't always hit to the exact price point gets close."
"liXizlLECHc","3910000","3922000"," So there's like, you shouldn't be like the bull to a, or like, shouldn't be like a fire flower mosquito to the, to the electric posts, or the light, you know, the, the bug zapper and trying to get whacked up here."
"liXizlLECHc","3922000","3925000"," They just want to see how this plays out right now."
"liXizlLECHc","3925000","3927000"," Let the market open up."
"liXizlLECHc","3927000","3929000"," Find it where the market's going."
"liXizlLECHc","3929000","3934000"," If we get a retest down below, it'll be on this white line right here, though it is looking bullish."
"liXizlLECHc","3935000","3939000"," Bulls are looking for, why did I delete that H line?"
"liXizlLECHc","3939000","3944000"," Bulls are looking for a retest and then attack for the H line above."
"liXizlLECHc","3944000","3946000"," I shouldn't have deleted that, but."
"liXizlLECHc","3948000","3950000"," Put it back on there."
"liXizlLECHc","3959000","3962000"," All right, let's see what you guys are saying in the chat real quick."
"liXizlLECHc","3963000","3966000"," And we'll see what you guys are doing here."
"liXizlLECHc","3968000","3972000"," If you are bear still, you're looking for a break below either of these two lines."
"liXizlLECHc","3972000","3974000"," We'll get rid of this one now."
"liXizlLECHc","3975000","3981000"," You'll be looking for a breakdown here, though I wouldn't be taking a short here unless you get some confirmation."
"liXizlLECHc","3981000","3986000"," You're looking for a break down below and then enter the trade here."
"liXizlLECHc","3987000","3992000"," Or you're going to be looking for rejection above and then it's the same break here."
"liXizlLECHc","3992000","3996000"," And then down here is the big trade, trade lower."
"liXizlLECHc","4001000","4003000"," This is why you take your puts off on the opening bell, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4003000","4004000"," We talked about that."
"liXizlLECHc","4004000","4008000"," If you're long or short, always take the money at the bell and get out."
"liXizlLECHc","4011000","4013000"," Reset yourself for the next trade."
"liXizlLECHc","4017000","4020000"," Sorry, Jean, I wasn't able to answer your question."
"liXizlLECHc","4020000","4022000"," How do I decide on what I buy?"
"liXizlLECHc","4022000","4025000"," Okay, so I used to be able to buy."
"liXizlLECHc","4026000","4027000"," I heard this comment too."
"liXizlLECHc","4027000","4028000"," I read or read this."
"liXizlLECHc","4028000","4032000"," They said I heard a comment in a YouTube video."
"liXizlLECHc","4033000","4037000"," I read a comment that said, I don't know why people don't buy a weeklies anymore."
"liXizlLECHc","4037000","4039000"," And I'll explain to you why right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4040000","4041000"," Back in the days."
"liXizlLECHc","4041000","4042000"," I'll make it real quick."
"liXizlLECHc","4042000","4043000"," Back in the day."
"liXizlLECHc","4043000","4045000"," We were going down."
"liXizlLECHc","4046000","4047000"," If we were going up."
"liXizlLECHc","4050000","4051000"," Used to be able to be one second here."
"liXizlLECHc","4051000","4052000"," I got a knock on the door."
"liXizlLECHc","4068000","4070000"," I got I got some coffee cake this morning."
"liXizlLECHc","4070000","4073000"," So I'm so stoked being loved on today."
"liXizlLECHc","4075000","4080000"," So back in the day, you should be able to buy a directional call, week out, month out, whatever."
"liXizlLECHc","4080000","4083000"," And the market would tend to go in that direction."
"liXizlLECHc","4083000","4084000"," Nice and easy."
"liXizlLECHc","4085000","4087000"," It does not do that any longer."
"liXizlLECHc","4088000","4091000"," You have computer programs."
"liXizlLECHc","4092000","4095000"," Algorithms that have ruined this market."
"liXizlLECHc","4095000","4097000"," All that market has gone now."
"liXizlLECHc","4097000","4101000"," Now you will directionally go where you want to go."
"liXizlLECHc","4102000","4105000"," And as you know, we do these violent moves intraday."
"liXizlLECHc","4106000","4108000"," We're up 70 points for down 70 points."
"liXizlLECHc","4108000","4112000"," We get a blast down blast higher come back into range."
"liXizlLECHc","4112000","4115000"," And this is destroyed the options market."
"liXizlLECHc","4116000","4119000"," But let's say this is like a month out or even a week out."
"liXizlLECHc","4119000","4123000"," And so what is that led me to?"
"liXizlLECHc","4123000","4125000"," That's led me to know two things."
"liXizlLECHc","4127000","4130000"," I can only stay in a move anymore for a direction."
"liXizlLECHc","4131000","4135000"," Number one, like if I pick, if I say, okay, we're at a bottom."
"liXizlLECHc","4136000","4137000"," We're at a 408."
"liXizlLECHc","4137000","4139000"," We're at a bottom, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4139000","4141000"," I know we're at a bottom here, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4141000","4143000"," And I know that we're going right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4145000","4146000"," Right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4146000","4149000"," It used to be back in the day you could buy a call down here for like a weekly."
"liXizlLECHc","4149000","4151000"," And you'd like come back in like a week."
"liXizlLECHc","4152000","4155000"," Three days later, monthly come back in a week or two."
"liXizlLECHc","4156000","4161000"," And you'd print didn't matter if it rolled over."
"liXizlLECHc","4161000","4162000"," You come back up."
"liXizlLECHc","4162000","4165000"," As long as you're directionally right and you bought the bottom of that direction."
"liXizlLECHc","4165000","4166000"," You're at the top."
"liXizlLECHc","4169000","4170000"," You'd be fine."
"liXizlLECHc","4170000","4171000"," You wouldn't have to worry about it."
"liXizlLECHc","4171000","4172000"," It's like, I'm out of here."
"liXizlLECHc","4172000","4173000"," Good."
"liXizlLECHc","4173000","4174000"," Made my 30%."
"liXizlLECHc","4174000","4176000"," Made my 70%."
"liXizlLECHc","4176000","4177000"," No worries."
"liXizlLECHc","4177000","4178000"," Right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4178000","4179000"," Can't do that shit."
"liXizlLECHc","4180000","4181000"," It's like all directional."
"liXizlLECHc","4181000","4182000"," Here's where we're at."
"liXizlLECHc","4182000","4183000"," Here's my target."
"liXizlLECHc","4183000","4184000"," The moment I hit it, I'm out."
"liXizlLECHc","4185000","4187000"," And so how do I maximize that?"
"liXizlLECHc","4189000","4195000"," I already know if I buy a weekly and we at any point break this and my weekly is fucked."
"liXizlLECHc","4196000","4197000"," It's never coming back."
"liXizlLECHc","4198000","4199000"," Never fucking coming back."
"liXizlLECHc","4199000","4201000"," I already know if I buy a monthly."
"liXizlLECHc","4202000","4205000"," It might come back and make like 5% or be flat."
"liXizlLECHc","4206000","4208000"," So dealers have gotten better too, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4208000","4209000"," I'm not paying you, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4209000","4214000"," So for me, at least I've been reduced past."
"liXizlLECHc","4215000","4222000"," I got pushed into having to trade the indexes probably two years ago."
"liXizlLECHc","4223000","4224000"," I got pushed into it."
"liXizlLECHc","4224000","4228000"," So now I'm like, I've been forced into trading the indexes."
"liXizlLECHc","4229000","4234000"," And so I'm on zero dates, one dates, sometimes two dates, one dates, two dates."
"liXizlLECHc","4234000","4236000"," So how do I pick?"
"liXizlLECHc","4236000","4237000"," If I'm trading intraday."
"liXizlLECHc","4238000","4239000"," So here's an example."
"liXizlLECHc","4239000","4243000"," So if I'm trading intraday, like right now, I'm trading this right here, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4244000","4248000"," I'll start immediately watching the options chain for zero dates in the money."
"liXizlLECHc","4249000","4254000"," And I'll watch up to a 30 delta call, let's say, if I think we're going up here."
"liXizlLECHc","4255000","4257000"," I'll be looking for that 30 delta call."
"liXizlLECHc","4258000","4261000"," And I'll see if there's first off, is there interest in it?"
"liXizlLECHc","4262000","4263000"," On that strike."
"liXizlLECHc","4263000","4268000"," If the interest is higher, let's say it's a strike closer to in the money."
"liXizlLECHc","4268000","4270000"," There's more people on that one."
"liXizlLECHc","4270000","4271000"," I'll be like, yeah, I'll get on that one."
"liXizlLECHc","4271000","4272000"," And I'll watch."
"liXizlLECHc","4272000","4275000"," Like if I'm in the wrong strike and they move from one strike to another,"
"liXizlLECHc","4275000","4277000"," I'll jump off into that strike they're in."
"liXizlLECHc","4277000","4279000"," And these are usually computers and banks."
"liXizlLECHc","4280000","4282000"," So they have high interest."
"liXizlLECHc","4282000","4285000"," And I usually follow that."
"liXizlLECHc","4285000","4288000"," We're going to tag the H line at 4.11.79."
"liXizlLECHc","4289000","4291000"," And we're going to, we should see some resistance here."
"liXizlLECHc","4291000","4297000"," You should see some selling right as we break into it or come into it, at least."
"liXizlLECHc","4297000","4299000"," I'm going to show it to you right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4305000","4307000"," And we're coming into that resistance right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4308000","4313000"," Now, what you should expect to happen is we are looking for to happen as a rejection here."
"liXizlLECHc","4314000","4315000"," In price."
"liXizlLECHc","4315000","4318000"," And you're going to wait for the one in five minutes to come up."
"liXizlLECHc","4318000","4321000"," This can turn into a three trigger cluster."
"liXizlLECHc","4321000","4323000"," If that green line comes down, that's price."
"liXizlLECHc","4326000","4329000"," This could turn into a three trigger cluster to go higher."
"liXizlLECHc","4330000","4334000"," Now, I don't, me personally, I don't think we're going higher."
"liXizlLECHc","4334000","4338000"," I think we're going to either roll this over and trade it sideways or roll over at some point."
"liXizlLECHc","4338000","4341000"," My, my guess here is that."
"liXizlLECHc","4342000","4346000"," We're going to reject here, start to trade sideways."
"liXizlLECHc","4346000","4350000"," And then hopefully we roll this, we roll this over here and price comes below."
"liXizlLECHc","4350000","4355000"," Now, I'm not in a trade right now, but just for looking at this cluster right here,"
"liXizlLECHc","4355000","4357000"," I'm probably going to take a trade."
"liXizlLECHc","4357000","4362000"," And so we'll pay attention to this and see if produces an up move."
"liXizlLECHc","4362000","4364000"," This is where you'd be buying calls."
"liXizlLECHc","4364000","4366000"," And this is where you'd be entering puts down below."
"liXizlLECHc","4366000","4369000"," You don't have to get caught up in here torn up."
"liXizlLECHc","4369000","4371000"," You don't need to be like picking direction here."
"liXizlLECHc","4371000","4375000"," There's no, no, no reason to there."
"liXizlLECHc","4375000","4380000"," I was trying to show how to buy calls and puts and not get fucked up in here,"
"liXizlLECHc","4380000","4382000"," but someone yesterday meant, made a very good point."
"liXizlLECHc","4382000","4387000"," They were like, well, I don't, I'm kind of buying the puts and the calls at the wrong price."
"liXizlLECHc","4387000","4391000"," And so this is what I'm talking about this, from leading to in this conversation."
"liXizlLECHc","4391000","4393000"," So even right now, we are right."
"liXizlLECHc","4393000","4395000"," So this is where we are right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4395000","4398000"," So now I'm looking at the February 16th."
"liXizlLECHc","4398000","4403000"," The 16th calls and puts on on SP on spy."
"liXizlLECHc","4403000","4406000"," And we talked about this earlier, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4406000","4409000"," 410 C's are now trading at $1.96."
"liXizlLECHc","4409000","4411000"," They're in the money."
"liXizlLECHc","4411000","4413000"," They just went up a hundred percent."
"liXizlLECHc","4413000","4416000"," There's a huge concentration of calls there."
"liXizlLECHc","4416000","4419000"," I think Omar pointed it out earlier as well."
"liXizlLECHc","4419000","4421000"," And so right where we are right now, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4421000","4424000"," If we're going to go higher, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4424000","4426000"," If we're going to go higher."
"liXizlLECHc","4426000","4430000"," My first thing that I'm going to ask myself is, what is the price target higher?"
"liXizlLECHc","4430000","4432000"," What is higher, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4432000","4434000"," And I'm going to look for a couple of things here."
"liXizlLECHc","4434000","4438000"," So I know where the scene of the crime is, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4438000","4441000"," The scene of crime is up here at 413, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4441000","4445000"," I know I'm going to show you guys this on something else."
"liXizlLECHc","4445000","4448000"," So let's say I think we're going up here."
"liXizlLECHc","4448000","4455000"," A couple of things I'm going to be looking for are, let me mute this to the background."
"liXizlLECHc","4455000","4457000"," Well, we're going to talk about strikes."
"liXizlLECHc","4457000","4460000"," We're going to answer your question in depth."
"liXizlLECHc","4460000","4463000"," So usually these last squeezes right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4463000","4466000"," And at the end of the day, these are all bullshit."
"liXizlLECHc","4466000","4472000"," This is all MOC, buy, side, and balance is usually squeezes higher."
"liXizlLECHc","4472000","4474000"," This isn't real money here."
"liXizlLECHc","4474000","4480000"," And so I'm like, eh, top is probably the pivot line right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4480000","4483000"," My next target higher is going to be 41254."
"liXizlLECHc","4483000","4486000"," That's what I'm looking for, right there, 41254."
"liXizlLECHc","4486000","4492000"," And the bears really do want to turn this support into selling, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4492000","4494000"," They want to hold this line up here if they can."
"liXizlLECHc","4494000","4497000"," They sold last night in the middle of the night at eight o'clock."
"liXizlLECHc","4497000","4502000"," So somewhere in here, they probably want to hold this at minimum."
"liXizlLECHc","4502000","4507000"," Probably going to see a more supportive market above this line here."
"liXizlLECHc","4507000","4510000"," So I'm not bullish here, but if I was,"
"liXizlLECHc","4511000","4513000"," I'm going to look at what?"
"liXizlLECHc","4513000","4515000"," Probably 412 C's."
"liXizlLECHc","4515000","4517000"," Not 413's, but like 412."
"liXizlLECHc","4517000","4519000"," Somewhere right here is they print the end here, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4519000","4522000"," And 412 C's are only one strike out of memory."
"liXizlLECHc","4522000","4524000"," Now they're 80 cents, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4524000","4526000"," So they're 80 cents currently."
"liXizlLECHc","4528000","4532000"," Do I know right now that we're going to win right here?"
"liXizlLECHc","4532000","4533000"," No."
"liXizlLECHc","4533000","4535000"," We just made a run up here, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4535000","4539000"," So the 412 C's are probably very expensive."
"liXizlLECHc","4540000","4543000"," And there's probably some horse trade going on in the background."
"liXizlLECHc","4543000","4550000"," And they probably want to reprice these options before we get to 41254 if we're going there."
"liXizlLECHc","4550000","4553000"," They don't want to be paying 41254s, you know, $1."
"liXizlLECHc","4553000","4556000"," Well, right now it says that they pay 40 cents."
"liXizlLECHc","4556000","4558000"," So they don't want to pay $1.20 up here."
"liXizlLECHc","4558000","4564000"," So likely not guaranteed, but likely they're going to cool those off a little bit."
"liXizlLECHc","4564000","4565000"," So I'm just going to pay attention to them."
"liXizlLECHc","4565000","4567000"," I'm just going to start looking at 412 C's."
"liXizlLECHc","4567000","4571000"," I'm going to watch the natural rise and fall in the price of 412 C's."
"liXizlLECHc","4571000","4577000"," If they go down, they fluctuate down to $0.60 down to $1 down to $0.50 down to $0.90 down"
"liXizlLECHc","4577000","4580000"," to $0.40 down to $0.80 and they come up slightly."
"liXizlLECHc","4580000","4585000"," And I'm going to try to find the bottom of that option if we're going to make that move higher."
"liXizlLECHc","4585000","4586000"," Right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4586000","4588000"," So I'm just watching that option right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4588000","4593000"," Matter of fact, they're trading now for $0.79, $0.80, $0.81, $0.82 somewhere in there."
"liXizlLECHc","4593000","4596000"," And so I'm looking at it right now and you know what I'm saying to myself?"
"liXizlLECHc","4596000","4598000"," Yeah, I'd like to get those cheaper."
"liXizlLECHc","4598000","4601000"," I'd like to get those like $0.60."
"liXizlLECHc","4601000","4604000"," Maybe even $0.40."
"liXizlLECHc","4604000","4607000"," So I'm going to watch those options right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4607000","4611000"," And if we don't have a bunch of wild swinger price movements,"
"liXizlLECHc","4611000","4616000"," but I think we're going there and be like, yeah, if I can get those, I might not get them at $0.60"
"liXizlLECHc","4616000","4618000"," or $0.40, but I might get them at $0.60."
"liXizlLECHc","4618000","4620000"," I might be able to buy them at $0.60."
"liXizlLECHc","4620000","4624000"," And if we have one more quick move down, I can buy some more at $0.40."
"liXizlLECHc","4624000","4626000"," Now I'm in it, $0.50 and we're moving higher."
"liXizlLECHc","4626000","4627000"," Right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4627000","4630000"," So I'm like, okay, how cheap can I get those calls for?"
"liXizlLECHc","4630000","4632000"," I love buying cheap shit."
"liXizlLECHc","4632000","4636000"," Love buying cheap puts, love buying cheap calls, all that kind of stuff."
"liXizlLECHc","4636000","4638000"," So I'm going to keep my eyes on them right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4638000","4642000"," They're $0.78, $0.77, $0.76."
"liXizlLECHc","4642000","4644000"," They're going down in price."
"liXizlLECHc","4644000","4646000"," So I'm just going to keep my eyeballs on them."
"liXizlLECHc","4646000","4649000"," And I'm going to let this work out, work itself out here."
"liXizlLECHc","4649000","4651000"," I just want to see if this support level holds."
"liXizlLECHc","4651000","4654000"," And I'm going to look for a higher, higher target, a pair of $4.13."
"liXizlLECHc","4654000","4659000"," Now while I'm doing that, I do actually have a bearish look on the market right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4659000","4661000"," I have a bearish view in the market."
"liXizlLECHc","4661000","4666000"," And I know that the options market today is priced in, not priced in,"
"liXizlLECHc","4666000","4670000"," but the lower target for today implied move currently, we're going to look it up."
"liXizlLECHc","4677000","4680000"," Omar said Omar was like, hey man, there's a ton of calls."
"liXizlLECHc","4680000","4684000"," They're not going to want those to expire in the money, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4684000","4686000"," We know that 410 is likely."
"liXizlLECHc","4686000","4691000"," They're not going to want these 410 C's to expire in the money, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","4691000","4695000"," Taylor's not going to want that to happen."
"liXizlLECHc","4695000","4697000"," So let's take a look."
"liXizlLECHc","4697000","4699000"," Let's find out if these guys are still on 410 C."
"liXizlLECHc","4699000","4703000"," Maybe they got some spreads that they want to print into the bell today."
"liXizlLECHc","4703000","4705000"," So I'm going to look at the weekly implied move."
"liXizlLECHc","4705000","4707000"," And I'm going to look at today's strike."
"liXizlLECHc","4707000","4709000"," 409 13."
"liXizlLECHc","4709000","4711000"," They're kind of right there, huh?"
"liXizlLECHc","4711000","4715000"," The lower move right now is 409 13 shocker."
"liXizlLECHc","4715000","4718000"," 49 13."
"liXizlLECHc","4718000","4720000"," I think we're going up actually."
"liXizlLECHc","4720000","4722000"," So let me look at those."
"liXizlLECHc","4722000","4724000"," Now there's 73 cents."
"liXizlLECHc","4724000","4726000"," 412 C's, 73 cents."
"liXizlLECHc","4726000","4729000"," I think they were 89 cents at one point."
"liXizlLECHc","4729000","4732000"," And we'll get a 10 pack of these."
"liXizlLECHc","4733000","4735000"," Plaid move for the rest of today."
"liXizlLECHc","4735000","4739000"," 40906 as the calls come into the options market."
"liXizlLECHc","4739000","4743000"," Plaid move tomorrow is 407 56."
"liXizlLECHc","4743000","4746000"," So let's look at today and tomorrow."
"liXizlLECHc","4746000","4749000"," 407 66."
"liXizlLECHc","4749000","4752000"," Right down at S two for tomorrow."
"liXizlLECHc","4752000","4755000"," That's the low for tomorrow is down here."
"liXizlLECHc","4755000","4757000"," Right now 409."
"liXizlLECHc","4758000","4762000"," 409 for today is the low for 901 right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4762000","4767000"," 40 901 right there."
"liXizlLECHc","4767000","4770000"," That wild."
"liXizlLECHc","4770000","4774000"," High target for 1298."
"liXizlLECHc","4774000","4776000"," I'll make this I'll make this blue."
"liXizlLECHc","4776000","4778000"," You can see it."
"liXizlLECHc","4778000","4780000"," There's blue."
"liXizlLECHc","4780000","4783000"," And then this is the lower implied move from here."
"liXizlLECHc","4784000","4786000"," The rest of today."
"liXizlLECHc","4786000","4790000"," And the higher implied move is 410 98."
"liXizlLECHc","4790000","4792000"," Get that right."
"liXizlLECHc","4792000","4793000"," 410."
"liXizlLECHc","4793000","4794000"," No, to get that right."
"liXizlLECHc","4794000","4795000"," 412 98."
"liXizlLECHc","4795000","4799000"," There."
"liXizlLECHc","4799000","4802000"," Get that right in room."
"liXizlLECHc","4802000","4809000"," 412 98."
"liXizlLECHc","4810000","4813000"," Make that bigger maybe."
"liXizlLECHc","4813000","4814000"," Listen right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4814000","4819000"," So the options market has priced in right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4819000","4822000"," So kind of right in the middle of it, aren't we?"
"liXizlLECHc","4822000","4826000"," Go any way."
"liXizlLECHc","4826000","4828000"," Hey, Sid."
"liXizlLECHc","4828000","4830000"," How you doing, brother?"
"liXizlLECHc","4830000","4832000"," What are you guys doing?"
"liXizlLECHc","4832000","4834000"," Right on, Sid."
"liXizlLECHc","4834000","4838000"," I'm not paying attention to the chat right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4839000","4841000"," R. D. Blot says super chat at five bucks."
"liXizlLECHc","4841000","4842000"," Just wanted to say 11 stream."
"liXizlLECHc","4842000","4843000"," Thanks for doing this."
"liXizlLECHc","4843000","4844000"," I've been learning a lot."
"liXizlLECHc","4844000","4846000"," Right on R. D. Blot."
"liXizlLECHc","4846000","4847000"," Jeffrey subscribed."
"liXizlLECHc","4847000","4850000"," And Raj Nees subscribed."
"liXizlLECHc","4850000","4851000"," Brad Armertaz, brother."
"liXizlLECHc","4851000","4852000"," How are you doing?"
"liXizlLECHc","4852000","4854000"," Each trading shorts."
"liXizlLECHc","4854000","4855000"," Let's have a great day."
"liXizlLECHc","4855000","4858000"," Happy trading to all and shout out to Sigma's keeping it a buck."
"liXizlLECHc","4858000","4859000"," Right on trade."
"liXizlLECHc","4859000","4861000"," You trading shorts."
"liXizlLECHc","4861000","4863000"," Right on, guys."
"liXizlLECHc","4863000","4866000"," I appreciate everything you guys are saying."
"liXizlLECHc","4866000","4868000"," Right here."
"liXizlLECHc","4868000","4872000"," We don't have a lot of range expected to say Dewey or currently we don't."
"liXizlLECHc","4872000","4876000"," Currently we've got a range expectation of here and here."
"liXizlLECHc","4876000","4881000"," Not a whole hell of a lot of expectations."
"liXizlLECHc","4881000","4884000"," My ride will get rid of this."
"liXizlLECHc","4884000","4888000"," And my next target's going to be above four to four twelve."
"liXizlLECHc","4888000","4890000"," Maybe a failure of four twelve."
"liXizlLECHc","4890000","4893000"," And not surprisingly, probably the pivot line."
"liXizlLECHc","4893000","4900000"," So maybe we can take this trade right now."
"liXizlLECHc","4900000","4906000"," Let's see if we can get up here and trade this pivot right up here."
"liXizlLECHc","4923000","4935000"," This rejection line is still up here."
"liXizlLECHc","4935000","4938000"," Probably going to cut these loose really quick here in just a second."
"liXizlLECHc","4938000","4944000"," If I can get 90 cents on them, I will."
"liXizlLECHc","4944000","4946000"," I'm going to try to sell them at 90."
"liXizlLECHc","4946000","4949000"," 91."

"liXizlLECHc","4971000","4976000"," Anyway, to see it as it unfolds."
"liXizlLECHc","4976000","4983000"," And I want to see if we get a little bit of a pullback here and anything like this happening."
"liXizlLECHc","4983000","4987000"," And watching price see what's reaction is."
"liXizlLECHc","4987000","4990000"," Does it start to break through and roll over?"

"liXizlLECHc","4996000","5001000"," You don't need to take this trade here until we get up here or down here."
"liXizlLECHc","5001000","5010000"," Okay."
"liXizlLECHc","5010000","5012000"," We'll just watch this as it unfolds."

"liXizlLECHc","5023000","5026000"," Breaking through the hourly right now."
"liXizlLECHc","5026000","5029000"," Bears do not want to give this hourly up."
"liXizlLECHc","5029000","5035000"," The hourly has been trend for quite some time."
"liXizlLECHc","5035000","5039000"," Do you want to see what the hourly looks like?"
"liXizlLECHc","5039000","5041000"," Let me get rid of this for you."
"liXizlLECHc","5041000","5045000"," Let me show you what our is looked like here."

"liXizlLECHc","5061000","5065000"," You can see this is where all the by the dipping has happened."
"liXizlLECHc","5065000","5070000"," This isn't indicative of zero-day call options."
"liXizlLECHc","5070000","5076000"," This is indicative of more than just a bull run."
"liXizlLECHc","5076000","5083000"," You know what the VIX zero-date catastrophe is looking like to me?"
"liXizlLECHc","5083000","5088000"," Not looking like a VIX crash or a market bullmageddon."
"liXizlLECHc","5088000","5091000"," You know what it's reminding me of?"
"liXizlLECHc","5091000","5093000"," Watch this trend right here."
"liXizlLECHc","5093000","5095000"," Watch this trend get bought back up again."
"liXizlLECHc","5095000","5099000"," Watch all this huge momentum coming up from underneath right now, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","5099000","5101000"," Telling you no."

"liXizlLECHc","5104000","5107000"," It's looking like a reprising of the VIX."
"liXizlLECHc","5107000","5110000"," What it's looking like."
"liXizlLECHc","5111000","5114000"," It's not played out yet, but it looks like it."
"liXizlLECHc","5114000","5121000"," Doesn't actually look like VIX is going to crash up."
"liXizlLECHc","5121000","5132000"," It looks like everybody bought the VIX with big money with size."
"liXizlLECHc","5132000","5137000"," I don't know if I can show you this here, but I was looking yesterday."
"liXizlLECHc","5138000","5144000"," I'm like these fucking guys are buying the VIX this week."
"liXizlLECHc","5144000","5146000"," Let me see if I can do this in the background."
"liXizlLECHc","5146000","5149000"," These fucking guys have been buying the VIX, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","5149000","5150000"," They went in."
"liXizlLECHc","5150000","5163000"," This big money went in showing on the second here."
"liXizlLECHc","5163000","5171000"," Let me just one second here."
"liXizlLECHc","5171000","5173000"," It's not showing up on my screener here."
"liXizlLECHc","5173000","5183000"," I don't know why."
"liXizlLECHc","5183000","5185000"," I'm going to show these guys buying the fucking VIX."
"liXizlLECHc","5185000","5197000"," It's wild watching them."
"liXizlLECHc","5197000","5203000"," The second here."
"liXizlLECHc","5203000","5210000"," I guess this can kind of show it."
"liXizlLECHc","5211000","5216000"," Let's see what they're doing."
"liXizlLECHc","5216000","5223000"," I'll show you why they're on fucking market watch."

"liXizlLECHc","5231000","5236000"," I'll explain to you exactly what they're doing."
"liXizlLECHc","5237000","5245000"," They bought the VIX here."
"liXizlLECHc","5245000","5250000"," They bought the VIX here too."
"liXizlLECHc","5250000","5254000"," They bought the VIX right here."
"liXizlLECHc","5254000","5259000"," They got told get, bent, and they bought the VIX here too."
"liXizlLECHc","5259000","5262000"," They got paid here, which is pretty good back in August."
"liXizlLECHc","5262000","5264000"," Right here is where they bought the VIX."
"liXizlLECHc","5264000","5270000"," They've been along the VIX since December."
"liXizlLECHc","5270000","5274000"," They're in a rage right now."
"liXizlLECHc","5274000","5275000"," Pure rage."
"liXizlLECHc","5275000","5279000"," They came back and bought the VIX again right here."
"liXizlLECHc","5279000","5285000"," They're in a rage again because they just got told no again."
"liXizlLECHc","5285000","5288000"," No."
"liXizlLECHc","5289000","5291000"," All this down momentum right now, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","5291000","5294000"," It's like no, no, no, no."
"liXizlLECHc","5294000","5297000"," If you're a VIX, you're like, no, no, no, no."
"liXizlLECHc","5297000","5299000"," We're going to squeeze through this."
"liXizlLECHc","5299000","5302000"," I can't say that's not true."
"liXizlLECHc","5302000","5305000"," We're not going to squeeze through this."
"liXizlLECHc","5305000","5308000"," But I will tell you this."
"liXizlLECHc","5308000","5311000"," If we keep seeing call buying, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","5311000","5317000"," If we keep seeing call buying, you're going to see a reprising of the VIX."
"liXizlLECHc","5318000","5323000"," You know, we can actually see it."
"liXizlLECHc","5323000","5328000"," You want to see a reprising of the VIX?"
"liXizlLECHc","5328000","5335000"," You want to see what it happens?"
"liXizlLECHc","5335000","5337000"," You see this right here?"
"liXizlLECHc","5337000","5343000"," You see VIX down here at $8.67."

"liXizlLECHc","5346000","5350000"," You see the VIX down here at $8.67."
"liXizlLECHc","5350000","5357000"," Can you imagine the VIX going from $19 down to $9?"
"liXizlLECHc","5357000","5366000"," You know, that would, that would enrage and rage some people."
"liXizlLECHc","5366000","5367000"," Enrage."
"liXizlLECHc","5367000","5372000"," If there was a reprising of the VIX down to $11.43,"
"liXizlLECHc","5372000","5380000"," if there was a reprising of the VIX down to $14.23,"
"liXizlLECHc","5380000","5382000"," enrage."
"liXizlLECHc","5382000","5384000"," Big money."
"liXizlLECHc","5384000","5386000"," So who's the real risk to?"
"liXizlLECHc","5386000","5389000"," The risk of market crash?"
"liXizlLECHc","5389000","5394000"," Or you're talking about maybe, how about a risk to the VIX market?"
"liXizlLECHc","5394000","5396000"," How about a collapse of the VIX?"
"liXizlLECHc","5396000","5399000"," Does anybody talked about that?"
"liXizlLECHc","5399000","5401000"," No one brings that up, right?"
"liXizlLECHc","5401000","5404000"," What if the VIX goes down?"
"liXizlLECHc","5404000","5406000"," What if the VIX goes to $8?"
"liXizlLECHc","5406000","5409000"," Who gets fucked there?"
"liXizlLECHc","5409000","5411000"," Not the bulls."
"liXizlLECHc","5411000","5414000"," The bulls don't get fucked there."
"liXizlLECHc","5414000","5416000"," Unless someone else is crazy."
"liXizlLECHc","5416000","5420000"," See what happens when all these averages are above here?"
"liXizlLECHc","5420000","5423000"," We get lows, man."
"liXizlLECHc","5423000","5425000"," You want to see the last time that happened?"
"liXizlLECHc","5425000","5428000"," Where price got underneath the blue line here?"
"liXizlLECHc","5428000","5429000"," You want to see it?"
"liXizlLECHc","5429000","5431000"," Right here."

"liXizlLECHc","5438000","5440000"," New lows, bro."

"liXizlLECHc","5442000","5446000"," You want to see that nastiness right there?"
"liXizlLECHc","5446000","5449000"," 2016 springtime."
